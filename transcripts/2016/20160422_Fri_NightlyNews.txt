[00:00:20.188 --> 00:00:22.230]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.691]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:27.874]  It is April 22, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:31.137 --> 00:00:39.864]  Tonight, Hillary Clinton says if she becomes president, she will use executive orders to take your guns.
[00:00:39.884 --> 00:00:42.646]  Let the congregation say amen.
[00:00:43.683 --> 00:00:54.445]  Then, get ready for huge Obamacare premium hikes in 2017, along with stiffer penalties for those caught without health insurance.
[00:00:54.985 --> 00:01:02.327]  Plus, a recent story by the Financial Times confirms what InfoWars has been saying all along.
[00:01:02.807 --> 00:01:06.948]  The Islamic State was created in part by the Saudis.
[00:01:07.448 --> 00:01:08.508]  Release the 28 pages.
[00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.451]  Didn't expect to see you here.
[00:01:13.872 --> 00:01:21.239]  You know, we've got Donald Trump entering the cultural pissing contest over who can use which bathrooms and I think you really stepped in it.
[00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.323]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News!
[00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:16.755]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:18.575]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:19.976]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.376]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:26.697]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:30.558]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.759]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.139]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.300]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:09.837]  It was only a matter of time, but now that time has come, they are already picking the bones of Justice Scalia for his Supreme Court seat.
[00:03:10.297 --> 00:03:15.962]  And in particular today, they're not talking so much about who's going to fill the seat, but the things that they can fill that seat with.
[00:03:16.283 --> 00:03:25.391]  And we see Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of Mrs. Clinton, the presidential candidate, coming out and saying, let's take advantage of the situation to ram through our measures of gun control.
[00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:31.976]  Matters to me that my mom also recognizes the role the Supreme Court has when it comes to gun control.
[00:03:32.976 --> 00:03:39.101]  With Justice Scalia on the bench, one of the few areas where the court actually had an inconsistent record relates to gun control.
[00:03:39.582 --> 00:03:45.667]  They say they believe the next time the court rules on gun control, it will make a definitive ruling.
[00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:54.234]  And in that full clip, you'll notice that she talks about moms demand action in, you know, the whole gun grab agenda, as I call them.
[00:03:54.534 --> 00:04:07.404]  Because the issue with these groups, especially not so much moms demand action, but the other group, the Bloomberg group, the Mayors Against Illegal Guns, or whatever they're called, they were very disingenuous about their gun control views.
[00:04:07.444 --> 00:04:14.369]  Because while they'll say that we just want common sense gun reform and we want to get these illegal guns off the streets and all this stuff,
[00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:23.371]  If you actually go to their meetings, as one of the mayors did, we put this article up a couple years ago, he said, when you go to these meetings, they say they want to ban the guns.
[00:04:23.412 --> 00:04:26.993]  It's not just getting fully automatic AK-47s off the streets.
[00:04:27.053 --> 00:04:28.193]  No, they're trying to ban the guns.
[00:04:28.533 --> 00:04:35.795]  Meanwhile, if you go ask Bloomberg himself, are you going to fall in line with your own gun control measures and disarm your security team?
[00:04:35.835 --> 00:04:37.336]  He says, I'll get back to you.
[00:04:37.356 --> 00:04:38.176]  I have to think about it.
[00:04:38.596 --> 00:04:40.457]  It's just the hypocrisy of these people.
[00:04:40.477 --> 00:04:48.539]  When you talk about these politicians, Mrs. Clinton, Bloomberg, Chelsea Clinton, they go to events where they have private security.
[00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.240]  They're surrounded by bodyguards and secret service.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.181]  I mean, they ride around in bulletproof vehicles, for goodness sake.
[00:04:55.501 --> 00:04:58.762]  And they want to tell you that you don't have the right to be protected.
[00:04:59.042 --> 00:05:02.705]  And they'll say, well, you can have a gun, just like with the Bloomberg group.
[00:05:02.966 --> 00:05:07.490]  You can have a gun, but once they get more guns off the street, well, the police can protect you at this point.
[00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.952]  Meanwhile, they're still going to have their bodyguards and the rest of it.
[00:05:10.332 --> 00:05:13.936]  And it goes for many of the pundits and the other people who want to get rid of the firearms as well.
[00:05:14.336 --> 00:05:18.620]  But it wasn't just Chelsea Clinton, the daughter who got in on this, Mrs. Clinton.
[00:05:19.141 --> 00:05:24.606]  She sat while a man talked, and she let him speak his piece, and then she said, let the church say amen.
[00:05:25.615 --> 00:05:31.699]  We need you to be able to use your executive powers to legislate that you can't carry guns in cars.
[00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:36.902]  You can't bring guns in buildings that are not insured to carry them.
[00:05:37.282 --> 00:05:40.084]  We need executive powers that say that we will fight for life.
[00:05:40.925 --> 00:05:44.147]  We can't kowtow to the sons and daughters of Charlton Heston.
[00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:46.228]  We must have a greater voice.
[00:05:46.668 --> 00:05:47.549]  Thank you for coming.
[00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:48.930]  And I will elect you.
[00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.710]  Vote.
[00:05:51.271 --> 00:05:53.593]  Let the congregation say, Amen.
[00:05:56.164 --> 00:05:57.685]  I'm not going to judge the guy in that clip.
[00:05:57.725 --> 00:05:59.605]  I'm not sure what his circumstances are.
[00:05:59.665 --> 00:06:00.786]  Maybe he lost a loved one.
[00:06:00.846 --> 00:06:02.706]  Maybe he lives in a neighborhood with bad crime.
[00:06:02.806 --> 00:06:03.207]  I don't know.
[00:06:03.807 --> 00:06:16.011]  But the issue is when he talks about these sons and daughters, descendants of Charlton Heston, however he put it there, it's a very wide grouping that is not accurate at all of the American gun owner.
[00:06:16.031 --> 00:06:17.792]  You have people from all denominations,
[00:06:18.272 --> 00:06:25.059]  All levels of income, background, race, religion, all these people come together for the American gun owner.
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.043]  It's not just some good old boys out there in the woods who like to hog hunt, though.
[00:06:29.304 --> 00:06:35.109]  That is protected by your Second Amendment, just as your personal defense is protected by your Second Amendment.
[00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.334]  And to anybody who thinks that the police are going to be there all the time to protect you,
[00:06:39.814 --> 00:06:48.341]  I can just say personally, and I'm not even demonizing all cops when I say this, but when we went to Ferguson, Missouri, myself and Joe Biggs, we were standing outside the police station.
[00:06:48.522 --> 00:06:53.506]  And when I say outside the police station, I don't mean down the street, around the corner, at a Starbucks.
[00:06:53.666 --> 00:06:55.868]  I mean like this camera is in front of me.
[00:06:56.368 --> 00:06:57.389]  That's the police station.
[00:06:57.769 --> 00:07:17.023]  I'm here in front of the police station and behind me where you see this picture of Mrs. Clinton, that's where the buildings that were being looted and robbed while the police stood there and watched while they had a full battle rattle, tactical gear, five MRAPs, tear gas grenades, the whole nine, and they stood there and watched those buildings be robbed completely naked.
[00:07:17.063 --> 00:07:18.244]  We showed you the footage of that.
[00:07:18.624 --> 00:07:25.433]  So if you think the police are going to be there to protect you at all times, when they're there watching the crimes, they don't want to break formation to come and save you.
[00:07:25.753 --> 00:07:30.659]  A similar thing when we saw in Ferguson, just a little bit further down the street, we went out to an area.
[00:07:31.932 --> 00:07:33.313]  And there were no police around.
[00:07:33.333 --> 00:07:38.797]  They had set up a blockade a couple blocks back, so they just watched as myself and Biggs went down there.
[00:07:39.158 --> 00:07:40.959]  And people were shooting at the firefighters.
[00:07:41.239 --> 00:07:46.083]  Now, once again, they got MRAPs, they got guns, they got tear gas, all that ready to go.
[00:07:46.503 --> 00:07:53.068]  Instead of going down there to defend the firefighters who were trying to put out the flames in the buildings, they told the firefighters to pull out.
[00:07:53.328 --> 00:07:56.629]  The firefighters had to leave so quickly that they left the fire hoses behind.
[00:07:56.849 --> 00:07:59.070]  And I'm by no means judging the firefighters.
[00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.430]  They got axes and chainsaws trying to get into these buildings and put out the fires.
[00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.471]  They don't have the means to defend themselves.
[00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:11.993]  This one I'm talking about, when they won't even defend their fellow first responders, what do you think is going to happen to you, the average citizen, if something like that happens?
[00:08:12.253 --> 00:08:18.995]  We'll talk about that more a little bit in our broadcast when we talk about people preparing for riots and mass civil unrest.
[00:08:20.035 --> 00:08:20.315]  So that's
[00:08:50.356 --> 00:08:50.656]  I'm good.
[00:09:05.151 --> 00:09:10.477]  And they say the suicide rate for middle-aged women ages 45 to 64 jumped by 63%.
[00:09:11.558 --> 00:09:18.164]  43% for men in that same category, but they say suicide rates for men in general are up.
[00:09:18.625 --> 00:09:21.128]  So when you talk about, you can ban anything you want.
[00:09:21.148 --> 00:09:24.331]  You can ban guns and pills and baseball bats, whatever.
[00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:28.596]  You're not getting to the root cause of why these people are committing suicide in the first place.
[00:09:28.936 --> 00:09:29.877]  Is it mental illness?
[00:09:29.937 --> 00:09:32.240]  Are they mad at the boss of the job?
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.902]  A marriage falling apart?
[00:09:34.182 --> 00:09:35.323]  Any number of other things.
[00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:42.892]  Banning the instrument they use to harm themselves and not get rid of the circumstances that make them want to harm themselves in the first place.
[00:09:43.232 --> 00:09:46.133]  And that's the whole thing when you think about, let's ban everything.
[00:09:46.433 --> 00:09:50.574]  Just like I give the example of that mom, I believe she's in Arizona, that happened last year.
[00:09:50.814 --> 00:09:53.555]  It happens every year, but this is just one of the more notable examples.
[00:09:54.055 --> 00:09:57.556]  Drowned her two young children in four inches of bath water or whatever it was.
[00:09:57.957 --> 00:09:59.317]  Nobody said, let's ban bathtubs.
[00:09:59.337 --> 00:10:02.658]  They say, no, this is a mentally ill woman who desperately needed treatment.
[00:10:02.718 --> 00:10:05.739]  Banning the water and banning the bathtubs would not bring those children back.
[00:10:05.779 --> 00:10:08.940]  The woman had deep psychological needs that were not being addressed.
[00:10:10.168 --> 00:10:12.850]  And let's say you do have some psychological needs and you go to the doctor.
[00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:22.496]  Well, your Obamacare insurance rates may be going up next year and you may not have the proper finances to help yourself out with those pills or anything else that you may need.
[00:10:23.176 --> 00:10:39.267]  Without venturing a specific percentage increase, the president and CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans said in an interview that the culmination of market shifts and rising health care costs will force stark increases in health insurance rates in the coming year.
[00:10:39.767 --> 00:10:49.682]  Now, Obamacare in my mind is somewhat of a tricky thing because if you look at conservative websites and news sites, they talk about it's the worst thing in the world.
[00:10:49.722 --> 00:10:53.127]  If you go to democratic websites, they say it's the best thing since sliced bread.
[00:10:53.548 --> 00:10:55.130]  So you can take it for what you want.
[00:10:55.911 --> 00:11:07.638]  When I look at masses of people in Florida being kicked off their plans, masses of people in California being kicked off their plans, rates going through the roof, I don't really consider that a win for the American.
[00:11:08.038 --> 00:11:10.440]  Especially when you consider how it was supposed to be free.
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:11.120]  You guys remember that?
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:16.123]  It was supposed to be free, then it went to affordable, and now it's like we'll charge you whatever you want.
[00:11:16.403 --> 00:11:21.887]  Because you think about the fact that this is written by the insurance companies, and it's like you let them set their own price.
[00:11:22.327 --> 00:11:24.649]  So what they're doing is fixing the market price.
[00:11:24.709 --> 00:11:29.873]  If you allow the insurance companies to set their own price, of course they're going to take advantage of that loophole.
[00:11:29.893 --> 00:11:31.174]  And it's just things like this.
[00:11:31.254 --> 00:11:35.937]  If you go back to the Obamacare website, it was like, what was the phone number?
[00:11:35.957 --> 00:11:37.899]  1-800-FU or something absurd like that.
[00:11:38.299 --> 00:11:39.260]  The site didn't work.
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.061]  Obama's even making jokes about it.
[00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:41.842]  He's like, yeah, I want...
[00:11:42.142 --> 00:11:42.503]  We're good to go.
[00:12:02.384 --> 00:12:03.325]  A glamorous deal.
[00:12:03.385 --> 00:12:04.805]  It's like you get a free pen, right?
[00:12:04.845 --> 00:12:05.606]  I got a pen right here.
[00:12:05.926 --> 00:12:07.607]  Now, this is a pretty good pen.
[00:12:07.627 --> 00:12:10.388]  You know, they probably got it from Office Depot or someplace like that.
[00:12:10.708 --> 00:12:17.672]  But if you go someplace and you get a free pen, you go to someplace, they give you just one over the desk, you click it two or three times and the thing breaks.
[00:12:17.732 --> 00:12:19.053]  We've all had that happen to us.
[00:12:19.333 --> 00:12:21.154]  It's the same thing with these insurance plans.
[00:12:21.434 --> 00:12:24.276]  When you make these one size fits all, it's free for everybody.
[00:12:24.296 --> 00:12:26.817]  You're not getting the best quality of
[00:12:26.837 --> 00:12:27.618]  Of insurance.
[00:12:27.638 --> 00:12:30.840]  You're just getting what's available to you at that time.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:37.204]  But I guess just more people are going to have to be affected by this in a negative way for the country to realize this as a whole.
[00:12:37.764 --> 00:12:40.046]  Now let's talk about some things that are going on overseas.
[00:12:40.086 --> 00:12:43.448]  We saw recently that President Obama went and met with the Saudis.
[00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:44.929]  And now we see this story.
[00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:48.331]  Saudis admit that they created the Islamic State.
[00:12:48.852 --> 00:12:53.275]  A recent story by the Financial Times confirmed something many of us have known for years.
[00:12:53.635 --> 00:12:57.858]  Daesh, aka the Islamic State, was created in part by the Saudis.
[00:12:58.718 --> 00:13:06.183]  According to the late Saudi Foreign Minister, IS was cobbled together in response to the Shia government in Iraq following the U.S.
[00:13:06.243 --> 00:13:12.528]  invasion of the country and the execution of Saddam Hussein, who got his start as a CIA operative.
[00:13:13.328 --> 00:13:24.358]  The Financial Times story, however, ignores the fact that the Saudis collaborated with the CIA and Pakistani intelligence to create the progenitor of the Islamic State, the Afghan Arabs.
[00:13:24.939 --> 00:13:26.540]  That would become Al-Qaeda.
[00:13:26.941 --> 00:13:34.788]  Other factions of the CIA, organized the Saudi-funded Mujahideen, coalesce into another fanatical Wahhabi group, the Taliban.
[00:13:35.248 --> 00:13:42.634]  Now I understand when you talk about all these various terrorist organizations it's hard to keep them straight and I'll be the first to say I don't do it right all the time.
[00:13:42.995 --> 00:13:48.719]  Actually I saw this graph and it outlined them as like Boko Haram and Al Qaeda and the Taliban and all these other things.
[00:13:48.999 --> 00:13:50.140]  I'm sure you can find it online.
[00:13:51.301 --> 00:13:55.585]  But basically the takeaway from this is Saudi Arabia, the country that we're looking at for the 28 pages,
[00:13:57.286 --> 00:14:00.247]  ...is involved in creating the Islamic State.
[00:14:00.267 --> 00:14:02.868]  And that's not to say that we ourselves are completely innocent.
[00:14:03.168 --> 00:14:07.230]  I remember that clip of, I believe it was Reagan, he was talking about the Mujahideen.
[00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:10.051]  And you guys can see that movie Charlie Wilson's War, they talk about this.
[00:14:10.071 --> 00:14:14.632]  I'm not saying it's the most historically accurate movie, but in broad strokes they address the situation.
[00:14:15.012 --> 00:14:22.755]  And there's that clip of Reagan in the news cycle, where he's like, yeah, the Mujahideen, they have as much integrity as our founding fathers.
[00:14:23.095 --> 00:14:28.086]  Meanwhile, they're out there after the war was done or they, you know, got the victory or whatever they wanted in that area.
[00:14:28.106 --> 00:14:32.014]  They're out there, you know, doing all types of horrible things with the weapons that we gave them.
[00:14:32.972 --> 00:14:34.193]  That's the issue about it.
[00:14:34.533 --> 00:14:42.016]  When you give a foreign country a bunch of weapons, they're not always going to act in the interest of the United States government.
[00:14:42.316 --> 00:14:45.578]  I guess in some ways they were, because they were promoting the business of war.
[00:14:45.858 --> 00:14:48.599]  Because we give them the weapons, then we have to go fight them for them.
[00:14:48.619 --> 00:14:50.660]  Even Mrs. Clinton admitted that a few years ago.
[00:14:51.241 --> 00:14:58.224]  Today we're fighting the people that we created many different years ago, but this cycle just continues and continues, whether it's Iran-Contra,
[00:14:58.604 --> 00:14:59.104]  We're good to go.
[00:15:18.413 --> 00:15:24.674]  The FBI wanted Apple to back-end one of their iPhones and allow the FBI to use it.
[00:15:25.034 --> 00:15:26.695]  And it wasn't just that one-time deal.
[00:15:26.735 --> 00:15:30.616]  They wanted to set a precedent so they could come in any time they want and hack the phones.
[00:15:31.116 --> 00:15:35.057]  But they eventually did it the hard way, or what they wanted you to believe was the hard way.
[00:15:35.097 --> 00:15:40.858]  And the FBI is saying that they spent over $1 million to unlock the San Bernardino attacker's iPhone.
[00:15:41.718 --> 00:16:00.630]  Now, to me, this is a blatant waste of money for the simple fact that John McAfee of McAfee Antivirus Software, you've probably heard of it, he got on national TV and told the FBI in very simple steps how they could hack into the phone with just simple devices that they could go buy at Best Buy or any electronics store.
[00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:15.375]  Meanwhile, the FBI, in the great show of bureaucracy, decided to go and pay a company over a million dollars to hack it for him when they were told step by step, point by point, by a guy who knows something about antivirus software, how to hack into the phone in the first place.
[00:16:15.715 --> 00:16:17.615]  This is just bureaucracy at its finest.
[00:16:17.915 --> 00:16:25.158]  It reminds me of that scene from Independence Day where the guys talk about, hey, do you think they spend, you know, $100 on a hammer, $500 on a toilet seat?
[00:16:25.458 --> 00:16:26.318]  Well, actually, they do.
[00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:28.999]  Because you guys have heard the stories about the gold toilet seats.
[00:16:29.179 --> 00:16:40.945]  I'm not exactly sure if that's true or at least not true in this country as far as being in government institutions, but I do have this article dated from the LA Times back in 1986 about $600 toilet seats.
[00:16:41.265 --> 00:16:45.567]  So if you didn't know, yes, they do spend $500 plus on toilet seats.
[00:16:45.607 --> 00:16:48.428]  It's right there in the headline for everybody to see.
[00:16:48.449 --> 00:16:49.949]  And these are the type of things they do.
[00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:51.410]  This is bureaucracy at its finest.
[00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.911]  We have to spend the money, so let's just go waste it.
[00:16:53.951 --> 00:16:58.993]  Let's not do it on giving our employees benefits or doing something else that would actually matter.
[00:16:59.193 --> 00:17:03.875]  No, let's go waste this money on $600 or close to $700 toilet seats.
[00:17:03.955 --> 00:17:05.956]  It's real and it is spectacular.
[00:17:06.832 --> 00:17:12.694]  Now, something we've been talking about here recently is all the preparation for civil unrest.
[00:17:13.134 --> 00:17:18.316]  And to be fair, we have had a good amount of civil unrest here in this country as well as abroad.
[00:17:18.696 --> 00:17:24.658]  And now we see that China is unveiling their anti-riot security bot that will patrol public spaces.
[00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:27.779]  And they say it has all types of bells and whistles on it.
[00:17:27.799 --> 00:17:34.061]  It has biochemical detection and it's capable of clearing explosives and on and on and on.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:39.801]  And as I talk about these things, a lot of people say, you're fear-porning, you're throwing all this stuff out there.
[00:17:39.901 --> 00:17:42.042]  Hey, I'm just telling you the preparations that they're doing.
[00:17:42.322 --> 00:17:43.362]  It's just like a fire drill.
[00:17:43.402 --> 00:17:49.464]  You had a fire drill in the elementary school because they thought it was possible in the near future you could suffer a fire in that building.
[00:17:49.804 --> 00:17:57.145]  And when I say these people, they're doing drills at the football games and the music festivals, and they got these bomb-sniffing robots running around.
[00:17:57.265 --> 00:18:03.107]  They think that it is a possibility in the near future that they could have some type of activity go on.
[00:18:03.547 --> 00:18:04.467]  I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[00:18:04.487 --> 00:18:05.888]  I'm saying that's what they're preparing for.
[00:18:06.388 --> 00:18:07.408]  There you go.
[00:18:07.448 --> 00:18:08.488]  You take that for what you will.
[00:18:08.968 --> 00:18:11.849]  And our final story tonight before we go into more special reports.
[00:18:12.169 --> 00:18:14.250]  This is a sign of the time, so to speak.
[00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:20.532]  You hear these stories about people with this trans movement, you know, I self-identify as whatever.
[00:18:20.952 --> 00:18:24.633]  Now we have a 30-year-old man who self-identifies as a high school student.
[00:18:24.933 --> 00:18:29.274]  The guy is 6'9", and he's out there dunking on all these little kids in Canada.
[00:18:29.674 --> 00:18:31.175]  The star of the basketball team.
[00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:36.140]  It just amuses me to no end that this guy had to go back to high school to become a sports star.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.641]  I mean, the guy's probably good.
[00:18:37.661 --> 00:18:38.602]  He's played in the D-League.
[00:18:38.622 --> 00:18:39.342]  He's a big guy.
[00:18:39.362 --> 00:18:42.805]  But it's just some food for thought before we go on to our other topics.
[00:18:43.085 --> 00:18:43.726]  So stay tuned.
[00:18:43.746 --> 00:18:47.169]  This is the InfoWars Nightly News and we'll be back right after these messages.
[00:19:04.887 --> 00:19:09.310]  There's a very important question that needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.451 --> 00:19:12.092]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.774 --> 00:19:15.775]  And to look at that threat we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.435 --> 00:19:27.183]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type 1 civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.857 --> 00:19:39.221]  You could say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.742 --> 00:19:50.126]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.781]  And merging with artificial intelligence.
[00:19:56.522 --> 00:20:01.383]  So they're trying to end humanity as if it's a good thing and create this new species.
[00:20:01.704 --> 00:20:03.064]  Talk about mad scientists.
[00:20:03.684 --> 00:20:06.205]  And there have been several new articles on this just the last few weeks.
[00:20:06.525 --> 00:20:10.927]  DARPA is testing implantable chips in soldiers' brains, is one of them.
[00:20:11.367 --> 00:20:15.048]  Another just came out in mid-April.
[00:20:15.188 --> 00:20:16.189]  Rich Americans
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.387]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.847 --> 00:20:31.937]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.413]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.873 --> 00:20:46.698]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.138 --> 00:20:47.919]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.499 --> 00:20:50.361]  In this short report, we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.997]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.638 --> 00:21:24.004]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Need Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.935]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.395 --> 00:22:04.098]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.678 --> 00:22:17.545]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.245 --> 00:22:19.766]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.226 --> 00:22:21.407]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.848 --> 00:22:23.238]  We do have that magic spark!
[00:22:24.127 --> 00:22:30.109]  But the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown in the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:46.676]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in Brain Force, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.
[00:22:47.096 --> 00:22:53.779]  Check out Brain Force today and other game-changing compounds like X2 Survival Shield at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:23:03.615 --> 00:23:08.978]  Eric Mankow Muller, in his own right, has exposed a lot of this over the years as well, so he's just tooting my horn when he gives us credit.
[00:23:09.198 --> 00:23:25.325]  He's one of the other hosts that has been willing to talk about a lot of these issues and discuss it, and he's somebody that I think knows more celebrities than anybody else out there, because he's been syndicated all over the country and been out in California when his career first launched to be one of the top shows in the country, even rivaling Howard Stern.
[00:23:25.585 --> 00:23:26.586]  So he joins us now.
[00:23:26.906 --> 00:23:29.407]  Mankow, always great to have you here with us, my friend.
[00:23:29.647 --> 00:23:30.948]  Really sad news about Prince.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.782]  Alex, can you hear me?
[00:23:33.802 --> 00:23:34.282]  Yes, sir.
[00:23:34.923 --> 00:23:37.245]  Okay, I'm walking through the streets of Chicago right now, my brother.
[00:23:37.985 --> 00:23:45.432]  I did replay where you talked about the blimps on my show, and I laughed at you, and I mocked you, and I can't apologize enough.
[00:23:45.512 --> 00:23:46.693]  I was wrong about so much.
[00:23:47.654 --> 00:23:49.655]  Look, you're so cutting edge.
[00:23:49.735 --> 00:23:51.017]  You're so ahead of time.
[00:23:54.637 --> 00:24:00.940]  The stuff you say that sounds crazy today, in five, ten years, everybody's going to go, yeah, that's right.
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.660]  It becomes common knowledge.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.982]  But you release these things, and it's the truth.
[00:24:06.062 --> 00:24:06.842]  It's just amazing.
[00:24:07.487 --> 00:24:08.687]  I have a lot to tell you today.
[00:24:09.047 --> 00:24:11.248]  First of all, I believe... Let me just go through a few quick things.
[00:24:11.628 --> 00:24:13.669]  I think Zika is setting us up for something.
[00:24:13.689 --> 00:24:15.089]  They're creating a lot of fear with Zika.
[00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:19.410]  I know you'll cover it on your show, I believe, getting us ready for voterless elections.
[00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:25.252]  And they'll try out Zika to take our attention away from our freedoms being robbed.
[00:24:25.812 --> 00:24:36.456]  I went to see a Journey show and Robert Fleischman, who wrote Wheel in the Sky, he's their original lead singer, is absolutely a huge fan of yours and told me some interesting stuff.
[00:24:36.496 --> 00:24:39.157]  Wanted me to reveal the hologram universe we're living in.
[00:24:39.517 --> 00:24:40.637]  We don't have time for that now.
[00:24:41.158 --> 00:24:44.539]  But my big surprise for you has been ruined.
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:47.240]  How is that?
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.962]  Well, I told you about Billy, the lead singer of the Smashing Pumpkins, and I think he's one of the people that's dialed in.
[00:24:53.641 --> 00:25:03.708]  He's seen behind, uh, he's seen behind the curtain, and I'm talking stuff like, um, well, kind of like what you would see, I imagine, the way it's been described to me, like Kubrick's, uh, eyes wide shut.
[00:25:04.489 --> 00:25:11.614]  Uh, Prince also talked to me about some of these, uh, some of these parties you call the Illuminati, you call the secret societies, the satanic, uh, blood stuff.
[00:25:12.194 --> 00:25:21.541]  People wonder why Prince dropped out, and I believe it's because, uh, he was, uh, he was frightened of these entities, uh, these things like Beyonce and Jay-Z and all the others.
[00:25:22.253 --> 00:25:27.834]  You know, some people are not willing to sell their soul, and I think Prince began to shy away from that.
[00:25:27.874 --> 00:25:32.956]  So, two years ago, maybe three years ago, Prince came and wanted to see me and wanted to see my studio.
[00:25:33.516 --> 00:25:35.776]  We did not have an extensive conversation.
[00:25:35.796 --> 00:25:37.117]  He did talk a lot to the girls.
[00:25:37.137 --> 00:25:38.417]  I had beautiful women around me.
[00:25:38.437 --> 00:25:39.517]  He did talk a lot to the girls.
[00:25:39.557 --> 00:25:42.058]  He did eat food off our craft services table.
[00:25:42.738 --> 00:25:43.978]  People had brought in food for us.
[00:25:44.078 --> 00:25:44.679]  I was shocked.
[00:25:44.719 --> 00:25:47.139]  He kind of hung out and talked to everybody with me.
[00:25:47.159 --> 00:25:50.520]  It was pretty much, he looked around the studio, looked at my equipment, was sizing me up.
[00:25:51.221 --> 00:25:53.121]  I didn't know if he wanted to do a TV show with me.
[00:25:54.182 --> 00:25:56.242]  I didn't know what it was about.
[00:25:56.922 --> 00:26:01.683]  But I spoke with him about getting him on your show and he said he would do your show.
[00:26:02.683 --> 00:26:16.025]  What we talked about and what he was fascinated with, and he said, you know, you and Alex Jones are the only ones to talk about it, is the chemtrails, the loss of freedoms through, you know, the music and everything else.
[00:26:16.045 --> 00:26:19.826]  He believed, he told me that he wanted, he believed that everything was going to go digital
[00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:24.941]  Uh, music, everything, so that if you irritated...
[00:26:26.659 --> 00:26:29.021]  The people in control, they just delete you with a push of a button.
[00:26:29.061 --> 00:26:36.365]  Well, I remember when you said, you know, you talked to Prince and he was a listener and I'm like, well, I think we tried to reach out to him, but that guy's got so many people around him, hard to get to.
[00:26:36.385 --> 00:26:37.265]  Right.
[00:26:37.285 --> 00:26:39.786]  These guys need to speak out before their untimely deaths.
[00:26:39.847 --> 00:26:42.048]  I tell you, it's very, very sad.
[00:26:42.088 --> 00:26:47.591]  But notice he's getting an autopsy, but the Supreme Court Justice, Antonin Scalia, isn't.
[00:26:47.851 --> 00:26:53.394]  And now we've got Chelsea Clinton video we're going to play in a moment, man cow, who says that now he's out of the way, they can get our guns.
[00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:58.692]  Alex, I have a lot, I want to say something, and I've been talking about this for years.
[00:27:00.313 --> 00:27:05.335]  My friend Andrew Breitbart and I, and you were to be part of that show, as you remember, in fact, we recorded a segment for Fox.
[00:27:06.116 --> 00:27:14.900]  Andrew Breitbart was going to do a segment, I'm talking Breitbart and all these other things that he started, you know, the Ariana Huffingtons, all these other people that he puffed up on the internet.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.822]  And you know, you would watch Glenn Beck and all he was doing was reading Breitbart.
[00:27:19.423 --> 00:27:27.069]  But Breitbart and I were working on a TV show, and he was going to do a thing on Fox News Channel, and he was going to do a segment called Future News, and he told me that he had video that would bring down Obama, blah, blah, blah.
[00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:34.054]  Hours before he was going to release it on my show and nationwide, worldwide, he was found dead.
[00:27:34.314 --> 00:27:35.775]  And they announced it immediately.
[00:27:35.935 --> 00:27:38.797]  Alex, I've been doing this since 1984, 85, okay?
[00:27:39.098 --> 00:27:40.359]  I've been doing this for a while.
[00:27:40.379 --> 00:27:41.339]  I've never seen anything like it.
[00:27:41.399 --> 00:27:45.983]  Michael Jackson, whoever, you know, Amy Winehouse.
[00:27:46.103 --> 00:27:47.124]  Don't jump to conclusions.
[00:27:47.144 --> 00:27:48.004]  We don't know who was drugs.
[00:27:48.064 --> 00:27:48.705]  Wait a minute, what?
[00:27:49.551 --> 00:27:50.612]  I've never seen anything like it.
[00:27:50.632 --> 00:27:56.296]  When Andrew Breitbart died, they said, uh, dead of natural causes.
[00:27:56.496 --> 00:28:00.178]  Within 30 minutes of him being announced that he was dead, they said natural causes.
[00:28:00.439 --> 00:28:04.661]  And now with Scalia, they announce, hey, he's dead, natural causes, no autopsy.
[00:28:05.142 --> 00:28:05.682]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:05.742 --> 00:28:06.403]  Listen, listen.
[00:28:07.123 --> 00:28:11.666]  And then people like me and you demanded an autopsy of Andrew Breitbart.
[00:28:11.686 --> 00:28:12.247]  And what happened?
[00:28:12.907 --> 00:28:16.970]  As the coroner was ready to give the notice, information, he was murdered.
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:33.988]  So, I just find it interesting that as this artist, Prince, and I didn't love all of his music, I'm gonna be honest with you, it's not really my genre, but 57 years old, he's talking about chemtrails, he's talking about how they're manipulating our water, how they're turning us into weaklings, how they're numbing us, how they're dumbing us down, how they're turning us into sheeple.
[00:28:34.368 --> 00:28:43.452]  Isn't it interesting that as he comes public, as he shows up on my studio and talks to me and mentions, he gets a lot of his information from Alex Jones, as all of this is happening, he's dead.
[00:28:43.472 --> 00:28:43.913]  Wow.
[00:28:43.973 --> 00:28:46.514]  Some people are telling me they think he was murdered, I don't know.
[00:28:48.717 --> 00:28:57.720]  Well, I don't know how much of this I can get into, and why don't you talk about what Billy said on your show, so I don't... his memories all blur what he's told me privately.
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:07.562]  Well, my big surprise was I believed I was going to get a press... came on my show, very quiet, very diminutive, a very intelligent guy, very smart.
[00:29:08.283 --> 00:29:09.583]  You know, these guys, they're...
[00:29:11.001 --> 00:29:12.542]  The image is created, you understand.
[00:29:12.602 --> 00:29:15.423]  I mean, I also interviewed Kurt Cobain and, you know, he was an artist.
[00:29:15.443 --> 00:29:16.023]  He was tortured.
[00:29:16.043 --> 00:29:16.923]  He was all this, uh-uh.
[00:29:17.243 --> 00:29:18.224]  It was all by design.
[00:29:18.244 --> 00:29:18.864]  It was an act.
[00:29:19.604 --> 00:29:20.264]  It was an act.
[00:29:21.705 --> 00:29:22.845]  He wanted to sell records.
[00:29:22.885 --> 00:29:25.906]  He created that image to sell records, that image of not caring.
[00:29:26.766 --> 00:29:27.907]  Prince, it was an act.
[00:29:28.947 --> 00:29:29.527]  It was an act.
[00:29:29.747 --> 00:29:33.769]  He borrowed it from James Brown and Little Richard and others, but a great artist.
[00:29:34.969 --> 00:29:36.930]  What particularly do you want to talk about what Billy said?
[00:29:37.625 --> 00:29:40.386]  Well, the problem is, stuff all mixes together.
[00:29:40.466 --> 00:29:44.167]  What's in confidence, what's private, and then I confirmed a lot of stuff he told me from other high-level people.
[00:29:45.388 --> 00:29:51.250]  And it's just crazy how the elite really want to have top rock stars and rappers and other people into their meetings.
[00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:57.111]  And this type of stuff, you know, I've been invited, not just to speak at Oxford and Cambridge,
[00:29:58.925 --> 00:30:00.426]  And then I was told, oh, you've been offered that?
[00:30:00.486 --> 00:30:04.149]  That's really the cover for this by a high-level person in Hollywood.
[00:30:04.169 --> 00:30:05.431]  And then sure enough, it did happen.
[00:30:06.051 --> 00:30:12.376]  And I've been invited to basically go over and be, I mean, eyes wide shut type stuff with real elites, you know.
[00:30:12.697 --> 00:30:16.280]  And the listeners are hearing this and they're going, oh, yeah, really?
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:17.461]  No, folks, this is real.
[00:30:17.901 --> 00:30:24.827]  That's why Vivian Kubrick, who was the protege of Stanley Kubrick, gave me the only interview she's given in 15 years about all this.
[00:30:25.167 --> 00:30:26.989]  And she knew the stuff I'd been through.
[00:30:28.471 --> 00:30:33.114]  It was, Leanne was there, we were at dinner, and she literally got down on her knees in front of me.
[00:30:33.614 --> 00:30:34.314]  And I was like, what are you doing?
[00:30:34.334 --> 00:30:37.436]  She goes, no listen, she started telling me all this stuff that no one would know.
[00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:39.971]  And I can't even get into it all.
[00:30:40.171 --> 00:30:42.753]  I just wish the public knew what was really going on.
[00:30:42.853 --> 00:30:44.535]  Alex, Alex, I want to tell you something.
[00:30:44.555 --> 00:30:45.615]  Eyes Wide Shut, brother.
[00:30:45.976 --> 00:30:47.197]  That movie reveals a lot.
[00:30:47.937 --> 00:30:49.078]  Eyes Wide Shut by Kubrick.
[00:30:49.098 --> 00:30:51.440]  It's an awful movie, but these parties do happen.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:55.102]  Prince talked about these parties, not just with me, but elsewhere.
[00:30:55.703 --> 00:31:02.428]  And are you willing, and you know, look, there's a great drug that my listeners have and your listeners have, and Alex, hell, you had it and I had it.
[00:31:03.075 --> 00:31:07.178]  And that drug is if we only had fame or we only had money or we only had this or that, we'd be happy.
[00:31:07.639 --> 00:31:10.621]  And I know, Alex, I know the battles that you've had in your life.
[00:31:11.542 --> 00:31:16.846]  But this drug, we have sold people this idea that fame will cure them.
[00:31:17.327 --> 00:31:20.870]  And so I understand that people are literally willing to sell their soul for it.
[00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:21.610]  You and I haven't.
[00:31:21.971 --> 00:31:23.452]  And I want to tell you that Billy hasn't.
[00:31:24.172 --> 00:31:24.752]  There's a reason.
[00:31:24.812 --> 00:31:32.355]  How about this guy that fills stadiums and sells millions and millions of recordings, and yet they press lesser stars than Billy?
[00:31:32.595 --> 00:31:33.276]  Why was he promoted?
[00:31:33.296 --> 00:31:34.216]  Because he wouldn't sell out.
[00:31:34.496 --> 00:31:35.476]  Why did Prince disappear?
[00:31:35.496 --> 00:31:36.337]  Because he wouldn't sell.
[00:31:36.657 --> 00:31:38.898]  He wouldn't give them his master tapes.
[00:31:40.278 --> 00:31:40.538]  Right?
[00:31:40.858 --> 00:31:44.160]  What about me and you, where we do these shows?
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.420]  I'm reaching 2-3 million people.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.721]  You're probably reaching more than that.
[00:31:48.081 --> 00:31:53.243]  And yet all we hear about is Anderson Cooper and Rachel Maddow, who has a couple hundred thousand people.
[00:31:54.492 --> 00:32:01.302]  It's all part of the facade, but I mean, getting back to that... We're not willing to sell out to the agenda, and if you don't do the agenda, you don't get promoted.
[00:32:01.703 --> 00:32:03.565]  If you don't have... If you don't... Yeah.
[00:32:03.886 --> 00:32:04.226]  I'm sorry.
[00:32:04.266 --> 00:32:04.747]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:32:04.967 --> 00:32:05.668]  Well, I don't even want to...
[00:32:06.912 --> 00:32:11.834]  Speaking of Breitbart, I mean, folks at that level now go around in disguises and things.
[00:32:11.874 --> 00:32:16.755]  People don't know all this, just so they're not known and seen in public because they're getting followed around 24-7.
[00:32:17.195 --> 00:32:19.336]  And I don't want to get up here and whine about this stuff to people.
[00:32:19.456 --> 00:32:22.497]  They just don't know how real it is until they've experienced it.
[00:32:22.677 --> 00:32:26.018]  And I know the circles you've been in, you've experienced even more of this than I have.
[00:32:26.078 --> 00:32:33.761]  But I was talking to just even Mark Dice when they were getting ready to give him a national TV show with some of the folks from Motley Crue.
[00:32:35.652 --> 00:32:42.397]  He's in the meeting and the head producer, not with Motley Crue, but with his big TV network, goes, listen, Mark, what's wrong with the devil?
[00:32:42.897 --> 00:32:43.798]  What's wrong with Satan?
[00:32:43.898 --> 00:32:48.462]  And starts praising Lucifer and asking him to join with Lucifer.
[00:32:48.542 --> 00:32:52.284]  And the guy was in a religious experience trying to sell him on it.
[00:32:52.324 --> 00:32:53.605]  And people just don't understand.
[00:32:53.665 --> 00:32:56.548]  They don't know what happens next level.
[00:33:02.372 --> 00:33:04.714]  A lot of people ask me what is the most important
[00:33:06.286 --> 00:33:06.546]  I think?
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:05.356 --> 00:37:07.438]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:37:07.518 --> 00:37:08.438]  I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:37:08.638 --> 00:37:11.901]  And I'm Joe Biggs and this is the InfoWars Nightly News Blitz.
[00:37:12.639 --> 00:37:19.881]  We wanted to let you know there's a lot of other news going on while everyone is preoccupied with this whole transgender bathroom issue.
[00:37:19.901 --> 00:37:22.602]  A little update on the Flint water crisis.
[00:37:22.722 --> 00:37:24.762]  Three people have been charged this week.
[00:37:25.122 --> 00:37:34.125]  The utility administrator who was charged with tampering with evidence, he has been charged, Mike Glasgow, as well as Mike Prisby.
[00:37:34.185 --> 00:37:38.286]  He's the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality District Water Engineer.
[00:37:38.906 --> 00:37:50.838]  And Stephen Bush, who he's also the water quality supervisor there, both of them have been charged with two counts of misconduct, one count of tampering with evidence, and another of conspiracy to tamper with evidence.
[00:37:51.018 --> 00:37:52.139]  All of these are felonies.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.723]  So of course we're starting to see a little bit of forward motion in this case.
[00:37:56.103 --> 00:38:01.609]  But interestingly, a lot of bodies are starting to pile up there in Flint.
[00:38:01.749 --> 00:38:02.750]  A little bit of some
[00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:05.692]  Yeah, it makes you think about what's really going on out there.
[00:38:05.712 --> 00:38:08.274]  You already know the system in Flint's pretty corrupt.
[00:38:08.334 --> 00:38:10.156]  Now you have these bodies starting to stack up.
[00:38:10.516 --> 00:38:11.297]  What's really going on?
[00:38:11.457 --> 00:38:21.665]  Yeah, and so there is a Flint water treatment plant foreman who was found dead just days before all of these charges were levied against his colleagues.
[00:38:22.025 --> 00:38:24.868]  And this is the water treatment plant foreman Matthew McFarland.
[00:38:24.908 --> 00:38:28.971]  He was found dead in his home on April 16th by a friend who went to visit him.
[00:38:29.431 --> 00:38:32.154]  An autopsy was conducted, but there
[00:38:32.674 --> 00:38:39.238]  Still is no determination of what caused his death, and authorities are waiting on a toxicology report, but that's not it!
[00:38:40.319 --> 00:38:49.385]  Yeah, and there's a woman in leading Flint water crisis lawsuits slain in twin killing, and her name is Sasha Vonna Bell, and she was one of the leading people.
[00:38:49.405 --> 00:38:52.967]  Her case was one of 64 lawsuits filed on behalf of 144 children by Stern's law firm in New York.
[00:38:59.611 --> 00:39:03.052]  Here you are, you've got a man, 43, he's involved in this, he's dead.
[00:39:03.332 --> 00:39:06.172]  You've got this woman who was killed in a twin killing.
[00:39:06.192 --> 00:39:07.432]  Something's going on.
[00:39:07.613 --> 00:39:24.296]  Yeah, and this woman here who was slain, her case played a very important role in the entire Flint civil lawsuits because she was one of several who filed actually in Genesee Circuit Court and then that was transferred to the
[00:39:26.676 --> 00:39:27.016]  I think so.
[00:39:46.812 --> 00:39:50.896]  And she said that her baby had lead poisoning as well, and that's kind of what got her involved in this.
[00:39:51.056 --> 00:39:51.296]  Yeah.
[00:39:51.336 --> 00:39:52.437]  You were there not too long ago.
[00:39:52.457 --> 00:39:54.860]  I mean, what was going on when you were in Flint, Michigan?
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:55.600]  What did you see?
[00:39:56.001 --> 00:40:02.186]  I mean, well, it was just a lot of people there who were really devastated by the state of their town.
[00:40:02.227 --> 00:40:04.729]  I mean, this is once a thriving city that turns into...
[00:40:04.889 --> 00:40:05.209]  That's right.
[00:40:23.772 --> 00:40:47.002]  And then just what we've learned in the months following, just how deep the cover-up went and how these government officials could be so neglectful to the point these three who have been charged, they were sending in improper water samples, trying to say that they were getting samples from the really heavily contaminated homes when really they were taking samples from homes that weren't affected by this at all.
[00:40:47.323 --> 00:40:49.664]  So were white people affected by this as well?
[00:40:49.924 --> 00:40:50.144]  Yeah.
[00:40:50.504 --> 00:40:53.025]  Wow, I mean, I guess Bernie Sanders is wrong again.
[00:40:53.805 --> 00:40:55.446]  White people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[00:40:55.986 --> 00:40:59.667]  Oh yeah, and that's a pretty crazy theory there by that guy.
[00:40:59.687 --> 00:41:00.988]  I couldn't even believe he threw that out.
[00:41:01.388 --> 00:41:08.751]  Especially considering that he didn't have a job until he was like 40 and had a dirt floor place for him and his first wife.
[00:41:09.371 --> 00:41:13.872]  But I don't know, that's what we kind of do here in America now, is just completely suspend our reality.
[00:41:14.713 --> 00:41:17.754]  Now, but switching gears here, we also have another
[00:41:18.254 --> 00:41:23.921]  ...court case going through with some ISIS suspects who were apprehended in Minnesota.
[00:41:24.001 --> 00:41:32.270]  These were three American men who were accused of trying to join the Islamic State group and now we're finding that one of these men...
[00:41:33.351 --> 00:41:33.671]  I think?
[00:41:56.642 --> 00:42:03.852]  He was asked if he was involved in sending troops or people over to Syria to kill American citizens.
[00:42:04.373 --> 00:42:05.534]  So they made him...
[00:42:07.216 --> 00:42:09.418]  The way they posed the question was... It would be easy for him to deny that allegation.
[00:42:27.113 --> 00:42:27.233]  Right.
[00:42:27.273 --> 00:42:28.954]  We already saw what happened in San Bernardino.
[00:42:29.274 --> 00:42:30.555]  We've already gone down to the border.
[00:42:30.575 --> 00:42:31.936]  Josh Owens and I went out there.
[00:42:31.956 --> 00:42:32.377]  We filmed.
[00:42:32.417 --> 00:42:33.557]  We showed you in Arizona.
[00:42:33.878 --> 00:42:34.958]  We showed you in El Paso.
[00:42:34.978 --> 00:42:36.019]  We've shown you in Laredo.
[00:42:36.399 --> 00:42:39.581]  Just how easy it is to come across the border in Laredo, Texas.
[00:42:40.022 --> 00:42:42.944]  Josh and I got those guys smuggling drugs over.
[00:42:43.224 --> 00:42:46.926]  Those could easily, in those satchels, be chemicals used to make explosives with.
[00:42:47.306 --> 00:42:51.429]  We saw with James O'Keefe dressing up like Osama Bin Laden crossing the border.
[00:42:51.569 --> 00:42:55.732]  Or in Canada coming into the States with sarin and all these different chemicals.
[00:42:56.072 --> 00:42:56.753]  You know, Ebola.
[00:42:57.233 --> 00:42:57.874]  It can happen.
[00:42:58.074 --> 00:43:00.395]  And it's not ridiculous for us to ask questions.
[00:43:00.415 --> 00:43:00.756]  Right.
[00:43:00.856 --> 00:43:05.079]  You know, we already know it's a widely known thing around the world that our borders are not secure.
[00:43:05.499 --> 00:43:11.623]  So it'd be crazy for these guys who want to do harm in America to ignore that important free information that they get.
[00:43:11.943 --> 00:43:13.825]  You know, hey, they're telling us their weakness.
[00:43:14.345 --> 00:43:15.086]  Let's exploit it.
[00:43:15.106 --> 00:43:15.506]  Let's use it.
[00:43:15.646 --> 00:43:15.826]  Right.
[00:43:15.966 --> 00:43:22.930]  Well, and not to mention, I know Breitbart reported about how they're actually now making some agreements with the cartels.
[00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:29.113]  And we just saw how they discovered the longest tunnel to ever be discovered going from Tijuana into California.
[00:43:29.553 --> 00:43:33.895]  And there, they only were able to confiscate a massive amount of drugs.
[00:43:34.275 --> 00:43:37.460]  But those tunnels could also easily smuggle terrorists through.
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:45.452]  So not only do we have a porous border, but there's also these underground tunnels that we don't even know where they are all across the country.
[00:43:45.552 --> 00:43:48.537]  Once again, we're willing to throw our safety away to be politically correct.
[00:43:48.749 --> 00:43:54.374]  Well, talking about politically correct, I mean here we have, and this is our fair and balanced justice system that we've got.
[00:43:54.414 --> 00:43:55.515]  It's just so insane.
[00:43:55.555 --> 00:44:07.966]  So the attorney who's trying to help these three men, or representing them, they don't want to allow certain evidence to be presented to the jury because they want the jurors to decide without fear and contempt alone.
[00:44:08.026 --> 00:44:11.189]  So they want to not put in things that are on their phones.
[00:44:11.769 --> 00:44:12.169]  I don't know.
[00:44:31.876 --> 00:44:33.257]  They're not terrorists, you know.
[00:44:33.417 --> 00:44:35.078]  They were just thinking about maybe being terrorists.
[00:44:35.259 --> 00:44:40.723]  Yeah, going as far as planning routes and contacting other elements outside of the U.S.
[00:44:41.124 --> 00:44:44.146]  in order to bring troops and recruit them into our homeland here.
[00:44:44.507 --> 00:44:45.608]  That's completely ridiculous.
[00:44:45.628 --> 00:44:54.135]  I mean, when you see stuff like that, it's just like, that's the evidence that needs to be presented to the jury that backs up the fact that, hey, alright, these guys are talking about bringing them in.
[00:44:54.155 --> 00:44:58.079]  Well, maybe they have this kind of stuff on their phone for a reason because that's what they're involved in.
[00:44:58.464 --> 00:44:58.664]  Right.
[00:44:58.724 --> 00:45:06.432]  Well, I just don't understand the reasoning there when you're trying to keep these men from going to prison for life, you know?
[00:45:06.452 --> 00:45:07.953]  I just don't understand it.
[00:45:07.993 --> 00:45:17.662]  But then again, this is America here and that's why they want to come exploit our judicial system so that they can, you know, plot terror attacks and then the PC people of this country will
[00:45:18.243 --> 00:45:18.863]  Thank you for
[00:45:36.411 --> 00:45:54.501]  The President will ratify it in December, so it's going to kind of have to go through Congress and this and that, but I'm sure he's just going to use his magic pen to go ahead and ratify this in December, which means whoever is elected next is going to have a really tough time getting the United States out of this agreement.
[00:45:55.353 --> 00:46:01.017]  Yeah, I mean, once again, they're using this beard and this whole transgender bathroom discussion to completely go and do this.
[00:46:01.037 --> 00:46:01.517]  Look over here!
[00:46:01.877 --> 00:46:04.499]  It's a magician trick, like, hey, look at this, but this is happening over here.
[00:46:04.519 --> 00:46:05.000]  Right.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:06.541]  I mean, that's what Obama's been doing.
[00:46:06.561 --> 00:46:09.663]  That's, I mean, it doesn't surprise me when you see that.
[00:46:09.683 --> 00:46:11.064]  I mean, sometimes you have to look past...
[00:46:11.924 --> 00:46:16.767]  The propaganda, the BS, and actually try to look at what's going on behind these closed doors.
[00:46:16.847 --> 00:46:23.971]  Yeah, whenever you see something crazy like this where all media is either on prints or this, there's something going on and it's this climate.
[00:46:24.251 --> 00:46:31.375]  There's a, they had a live thing outside of his home where they were talking about the autopsy.
[00:46:32.591 --> 00:46:32.831]  Yeah.
[00:46:33.111 --> 00:46:34.272]  Well, not for Scalia, though.
[00:46:34.472 --> 00:46:35.013]  Not Scalia, yeah.
[00:46:35.253 --> 00:46:38.275]  Yeah, that one doesn't matter, and you're racist for even asking about it.
[00:46:38.675 --> 00:46:49.644]  Now, a UN official has admitted that the UN seeks to redistribute de facto the world's wealth by climate policy, and they're calling for a centralized transformation.
[00:46:49.704 --> 00:46:56.248]  It's going to make the life of everyone on the planet very different to combat the alleged global warming threat.
[00:46:56.609 --> 00:46:57.029]  Stick around.
[00:46:57.069 --> 00:46:58.210]  There's more news coming up.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:07.462]  Get Brain Force at 25% off for a limited time at Infowarslife.com.
[00:47:07.602 --> 00:47:09.783]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.903 --> 00:47:16.706]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:16.946 --> 00:47:20.207]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.227 --> 00:47:21.408]  You're going to crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.990]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:53.014]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:47:53.054 --> 00:47:55.737]  Get BrainForce at 25% off for a limited time at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:47:55.757 --> 00:47:56.918]  And we thank you for your support.
[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:35.299 --> 00:48:37.600]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.701]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:48:41.081 --> 00:48:46.583]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the InfoWar.
[00:48:47.023 --> 00:48:53.691]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
[00:48:54.032 --> 00:48:58.898]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:49:07.964 --> 00:49:20.974]  While mainstream media, the failed propaganda Goliath, desperately wheezes for air, swimming upstream in a raging river of American truth and relevance, the force of the New World Order's establishment mind control is getting bolder.
[00:49:21.837 --> 00:49:28.002]  With Justice Scalia on the bench, one of the few areas where the court actually had an inconsistent record relates to gun control.
[00:49:28.623 --> 00:49:36.170]  Sometimes the court upheld local and state gun control measures as being compliant with the Second Amendment, and sometimes the court struck them down.
[00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:41.554]  They say they believe the next time the court rules on gun control will make a definitive
[00:49:42.574 --> 00:49:42.954]  We're good to go.
[00:50:02.674 --> 00:50:05.795]  Terrorism indefinitely without charge or trial.
[00:50:05.995 --> 00:50:18.800]  And considering the fact that the establishment's number one target is domestic terrorists labeled as constitutionalists, or patriots, or even documentary filmmakers, that authorization is highly disturbing.
[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:20.061]  It just took them away.
[00:50:20.641 --> 00:50:20.941]  Where?
[00:50:22.001 --> 00:50:23.842]  Re-education camps, that's what they call it.
[00:50:24.235 --> 00:50:37.866]  So it should come as no surprise that the puppets with their perfect hair and hubris-filled blank teleprompter reading minds are being forced to ratchet up a full-on cannibalistic assault on their own deteriorating journalistic integrity.
[00:50:37.926 --> 00:50:43.650]  We should spend more time listening to what others have to say and less focusing on the grammar, what they say it with.
[00:50:44.051 --> 00:50:46.773]  Supporting mindless disinformation like this...
[00:50:47.563 --> 00:50:54.792]  And firing people like ESPN's recent firing of Kurt Schilling over the exercise over what is simply Schilling's free speech.
[00:51:04.705 --> 00:51:09.448]  The more this occurs, the more the disgust for mainstream media grows.
[00:51:09.908 --> 00:51:16.673]  Investors Business Daily writes, more information travels faster to more consumers than ever before.
[00:51:17.033 --> 00:51:21.156]  So why does a new survey show trust in media at rock bottom?
[00:51:21.596 --> 00:51:25.519]  Because so much more accurate information is available elsewhere.
[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:42.674]  There is no incongruity in the fact that a new poll conducted by the Media Insight Project, a joint project of the American Press Institute and the Associated Press Center for Public Affairs Research, finds the American media's popularity way down with that of Washington politicians.
[00:51:43.234 --> 00:51:50.958]  With 2014 adults surveyed, only 6% expressed a lot of confidence in the press.
[00:51:51.558 --> 00:52:01.463]  And in its technological haste to sell meaningless swill through clickbaiting rather than focusing on what people truly want, real verifiable journalistic truth,
[00:52:01.963 --> 00:52:07.648]  Social media and online journalism also created its own hyperactive click trap.
[00:52:07.989 --> 00:52:19.580]  TheInformation.com writes, digital media companies are caught in the crap trap, mass-producing trashy clickbait so they can claim huge audiences and often higher valuations.
[00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:23.483]  But that model failed, heralded by mass layoffs.
[00:52:24.444 --> 00:52:38.216]  As the crow flies, the days of cable network media being the successful and reliable source of unfiltered information it once was in the archaic past will be as distant a memory as Brian Williams' career.
[00:52:38.776 --> 00:52:48.425]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com I'm not gonna sit here and take it anymore!
[00:52:50.859 --> 00:52:50.979]  Oh!
[00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:52.922]  Didn't expect to see you here.
[00:52:52.942 --> 00:52:57.528]  I mean, this is a public restroom after all, but not that public.
[00:52:57.829 --> 00:53:00.452]  I didn't expect an audience while I was in here.
[00:53:01.445 --> 00:53:08.808]  You know, we've got Donald Trump entering the cultural pissing contest over who can use which bathrooms, and I think you really stepped in it.
[00:53:09.128 --> 00:53:16.631]  He has walked that back a little bit, saying that, no, I misspoke when I supported people's rights to use bathrooms wherever they want.
[00:53:17.191 --> 00:53:19.012]  There are some jurisdictions here.
[00:53:19.032 --> 00:53:20.052]  It should be left to the states.
[00:53:20.072 --> 00:53:21.893]  That's what he should have said from the very beginning.
[00:53:21.913 --> 00:53:23.954]  He should have said, I'm president.
[00:53:24.354 --> 00:53:26.455]  Why are you asking me about bathrooms?
[00:53:26.875 --> 00:53:28.356]  I don't have any authority on it.
[00:53:28.436 --> 00:53:29.176]  Isn't it pathetic?
[00:53:29.816 --> 00:53:36.698]  That we want to have somebody at the very top who is going to dictate everything to us, even where we can go to the bathroom.
[00:53:37.478 --> 00:53:43.340]  You know, we talk about boundaries and we talk about borders, and that's one of the things that's made Donald Trump so popular here.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.621]  There are constitutional boundaries.
[00:53:46.263 --> 00:53:48.185]  Now Donald Trump recognized that today.
[00:53:48.265 --> 00:53:51.147]  I still don't see that recognition though from Ted Cruz.
[00:53:51.527 --> 00:53:53.329]  This is something that should be decided at the states.
[00:53:53.649 --> 00:53:57.912]  It is something that should be a private property issue as well.
[00:53:58.412 --> 00:54:02.476]  You should not have even the state government intruding on our private property.
[00:54:02.536 --> 00:54:05.058]  But it's really about privacy.
[00:54:05.678 --> 00:54:09.119]  You know, one of the words for bathroom used to be called privy.
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:12.561]  We don't use that term too much anymore, but that's essentially what it's about.
[00:54:12.921 --> 00:54:13.741]  It's about privacy.
[00:54:14.041 --> 00:54:17.783]  About the fact that when I'm in here, I don't expect an audience.
[00:54:17.983 --> 00:54:22.005]  We have bathrooms because we want to have privacy.
[00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:24.806]  It's why we don't go to the bathroom outside, isn't it?
[00:54:25.765 --> 00:54:31.967]  But we need to understand that we have to respect those boundaries, and there are security reasons as well.
[00:54:32.027 --> 00:54:35.108]  Just like we have at the border, there are also security reasons.
[00:54:35.849 --> 00:54:50.874]  You know, it's interesting, when I was back in North Carolina, we had a judge who got drunk, and he relieved himself outside, and he was seen doing that, and he was removed from the bench for indecent exposure.
[00:54:52.788 --> 00:55:03.695]  That is now being mandated, essentially, by our governments, telling people that we're going to open up the bathrooms for everyone, that we're going to let men go to the bathroom in women's areas.
[00:55:03.735 --> 00:55:18.184]  As a matter of fact, we have a judge, even after we disbarred a judge for indecent exposure, we have a judge now in Virginia who's told the school district there that they're not going to be allowed to have separate boys' and girls' bathrooms.
[00:55:18.204 --> 00:55:21.526]  They're not going to be allowed to have separate showers for boys and girls.
[00:55:21.866 --> 00:55:33.978]  So, after a judge was removed for indecent exposure for publicly going to the bathroom, we now have a judge who is mandating indecent exposure with our children.
[00:55:34.767 --> 00:55:36.968]  That is the brave new world that we're looking at.
[00:55:37.608 --> 00:55:51.415]  And when we talk about governments entering into this, violating private property rights, understand that in Arizona, we've just had a bill introduced that would require urinals to be added to ladies' rooms.
[00:55:51.696 --> 00:55:56.218]  And along with that, they're going to be having men come into the ladies' rooms, obviously as well.
[00:55:57.048 --> 00:55:59.731]  Now, I will not be using bathrooms like that.
[00:55:59.971 --> 00:56:09.141]  And if Donald Trump wants to let Caitlyn Jenner go to any bathroom that he or she wants to go to and Trump Towers or Target wants to do the same thing, I won't be going to Target.
[00:56:09.561 --> 00:56:10.962]  I won't be going to Trump Towers.
[00:56:10.982 --> 00:56:14.987]  And you know, I might just boycott the election as well.
[00:56:15.802 --> 00:56:17.964]  Because we need to understand where these boundaries are.
[00:56:18.924 --> 00:56:30.093]  When Ted Cruz comes into it, he's right on the individual issue, but he is wrong to make this a religious issue, to try to pull in and divide the population.
[00:56:30.193 --> 00:56:41.482]  People of both sexes, people whether they're LGBT or whatever, they need to understand that we need to maintain our personal space, our privacy, our decency.
[00:56:42.469 --> 00:57:02.045]  When we lose our decency, when we lose the boundaries and the distinctions between men and women, when we purposely try to eradicate those boundary lines, we not only put ourselves in danger by allowing sexual predators to enter a private space by just wearing a dress, and I'm not saying that the transgenders are that way.
[00:57:02.285 --> 00:57:06.249]  I'm saying sexual predators will masquerade as transgenders, and once they do,
[00:57:07.574 --> 00:57:09.115]  And that happens once or twice.
[00:57:09.436 --> 00:57:14.660]  They, the transgenders, the LGBT crowd, will never get rid of that stigma.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:16.421]  So they've got a dog in this fight as well.
[00:57:17.082 --> 00:57:19.123]  They should be maintaining these boundaries.
[00:57:19.504 --> 00:57:21.665]  They should be concerned about safety.
[00:57:22.386 --> 00:57:25.649]  And not mandating indecent exposure.
[00:57:25.689 --> 00:57:26.589]  But that's what we're saying.
[00:57:26.850 --> 00:57:27.510]  Understand this.
[00:57:28.051 --> 00:57:29.812]  We talk about the borders of the country.
[00:57:30.072 --> 00:57:33.155]  Donald Trump has said, if you don't have borders, you don't have a country.
[00:57:34.025 --> 00:57:35.446]  Well, it's also true within the country.
[00:57:36.026 --> 00:57:51.153]  When we destroy the boundaries, when we destroy the borders, the boundaries of decency, the borders of privacy, the boundaries and the restrictions on government authority and our private lives and our private property, we will destroy our family.
[00:57:51.914 --> 00:57:53.595]  We will destroy our rule of law.
[00:57:54.395 --> 00:57:57.817]  We will destroy everything that is worth having in a country.
[00:57:58.537 --> 00:57:59.738]  And that's what you need to understand.
[00:58:00.598 --> 00:58:05.120]  We are in danger of losing something that is far greater than merely our sovereignty.
[00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:14.804]  It's our decency, our respect for each other as individuals, our privacy, our private property rights, our constitutional law and our constitutional rights.
[00:58:15.344 --> 00:58:16.685]  That's the real issue.
[00:58:16.705 --> 00:58:19.366]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:58:20.447 --> 00:58:21.727]  Well, that's it for our show tonight.
[00:58:21.747 --> 00:58:25.509]  I'm Jakari Jackson from the InfoWars Command Center, and we'll see you again next week.
[00:58:31.041 --> 00:58:33.524]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:58:34.084 --> 00:58:35.626]  It just pancaked.
[00:58:35.886 --> 00:58:38.429]  Well, pancaking almost like a precision implosion.
[00:58:42.714 --> 00:58:51.224]  It's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before, when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[00:59:03.846 --> 00:59:04.986]  Knockout is back.
[00:59:05.347 --> 00:59:16.430]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[00:59:16.850 --> 00:59:18.531]  Infowarslife.com.

[00:59:28.574 --> 00:59:30.334]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:59:30.895 --> 00:59:31.775]  It's the same price
