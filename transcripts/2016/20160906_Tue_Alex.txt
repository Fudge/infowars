[00:00:24.176 --> 00:00:28.659]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.102]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:46.352 --> 00:00:52.217]  The quickening, the acceleration towards something like a singularity.
[00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:59.704]  is undeniably apparent right now.
[00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:12.789]  The dehumanization, the fall of our species and the rest of life on this planet is evident every day in the numbers, the facts, the statistics, the studies that are coming in.
[00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.812]  And there is an organized architectural evil pushing the entire program.
[00:01:22.984 --> 00:01:24.505]  I say this every day because it's so true.
[00:01:26.145 --> 00:01:30.167]  Every day, every week, the news gets more insane, more out in the open.
[00:01:30.207 --> 00:01:33.328]  I'm going to do my very best today to cover all of this because I've got to.
[00:01:33.928 --> 00:01:47.913]  I have a stack of news, without even looking for it, of massive increased lies, deception, censorship in the press, a wanton desire, a hardcore passion.
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.723]  To be dishonorable and to deceive the American people on criminal energy.
[00:01:57.824 --> 00:02:05.529]  At the same time, we have Hillary Clinton clearly crashing and burning, having a four and a half minute coughing fit of a five minute speech.
[00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.330]  NBC News said she almost had to cut it short.
[00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.571]  No, I know her speeches.
[00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:10.991]  They're normally 10 minutes long.
[00:02:12.052 --> 00:02:12.712]  She cut it off.
[00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:13.813]  She had to end the speech.
[00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:16.981]  I don't know.
[00:02:35.796 --> 00:02:42.162]  In fact, I saw this last night and I thought to myself, that looks like a bunch of teenage girls that are seeing some celebrity.
[00:02:42.543 --> 00:02:48.929]  And the media even made the point that they look like they're a bunch of teenage girls at some type of, you know, pop rock concert.
[00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.591]  Just fawning.
[00:02:51.952 --> 00:02:58.118]  Even the media admits, oh, she has a coterie of women that follow her around and admit they're distorting everything and they're proud of it.
[00:02:58.458 --> 00:02:59.299]  Because she's a woman.
[00:03:00.674 --> 00:03:15.824]  Yeah, throw all the basic conventions out, be completely corrupt, lie to everybody, cover everything up, but it's okay because it's cutesy because she's an old, creepy, warmongering, kingpin, mafioso woman who's been in the CIA since she was 19 years old.
[00:03:16.264 --> 00:03:18.145]  And that's all been declassified, it's all come out.
[00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.707]  Just like Anderson Cooper, Obama, all these people.
[00:03:21.607 --> 00:03:23.389]  When I say CIA, they're worse than that.
[00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:27.511]  They are foundation operatives put in the CIA.
[00:03:27.912 --> 00:03:28.192]  They are
[00:03:29.383 --> 00:03:33.405]  Carnegie Endowment, they are Ford Foundation, they are the enemy.
[00:03:33.485 --> 00:03:37.486]  They are the globalists, they are the offshore banks, they are the plague.
[00:03:40.007 --> 00:03:41.988]  They're not collaborators because they were never Americans.
[00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.710]  George Soros is just one of their captains.
[00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:51.492]  And yes, there are shadowy generals involved.
[00:03:53.394 --> 00:03:55.456]  Unbelievable news in Europe.
[00:03:55.816 --> 00:04:00.559]  After the huge Brexit referendum, the new British Prime Minister is moving to totally open their borders.
[00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:07.024]  Nigel Farage said, I stepped down to give you guys a chance to do what the British people wanted.
[00:04:07.764 --> 00:04:09.145]  I'm getting ready to come back after you.
[00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:10.386]  That's what he told me privately.
[00:04:10.887 --> 00:04:11.867]  I said, well, is that a secret?
[00:04:11.887 --> 00:04:13.228]  I should have asked what was on the show last week.
[00:04:13.588 --> 00:04:14.149]  And he said, no.
[00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.251]  But I never got to those questions on air.
[00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:22.675]  But he told me over dinner and a drink at the RNC, outside the RNC having dinner, that
[00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:37.275]  He's just giving them a shot and that he wants and you know hopes that the government does the right thing and follows the wish the people but he said the horse is ready and the minute they back off he's getting back in the arena which get ready you're going to see it happen very very soon.
[00:04:37.996 --> 00:04:39.017]  I would look for him to run for
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.062]  To get back into the UK Parliament and run for Prime Minister and end up saving the UK.
[00:04:47.343 --> 00:04:47.603]  Awesome.
[00:04:47.623 --> 00:04:53.485]  I mean, I wish they would have done the right thing, but watch for Nigel Farage to get saddled up on his biggest war horse now.
[00:04:54.525 --> 00:04:56.366]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is so much to cover.
[00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:57.346]  My head is spinning.
[00:04:58.007 --> 00:04:59.467]  We're going to get to all of it today.
[00:05:01.568 --> 00:05:09.131]  Give the water to the eyes over Bear Creek, which is a American file way of saying if the hair doesn't lift, the admiral will stay with us.
[00:05:14.252 --> 00:05:21.716]  On July 30th, Alex Jones made a request that Donald Trump make rigged elections one of the central campaign issues.
[00:05:22.437 --> 00:05:27.800]  On August 1st, Donald Trump went on Sean Hannity and spoke with Sean about rigged elections.
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:35.064]  Vladimir Putin came out a few days later and spoke about how American elections have been rigged in the past.
[00:05:35.665 --> 00:05:37.246]  Here's a recap of those events.
[00:05:37.886 --> 00:05:40.928]  Mr. Trump, I'm not going to lay things out here that you don't already know.
[00:05:41.872 --> 00:05:54.799]  But I am going to ask you to seriously think about making the issue of Hillary's election fraud in the primaries one of the central issues to defeating her in November.
[00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:59.161]  And I'm telling you, November 8th, we better be careful because that election's gonna be rigged.
[00:05:59.301 --> 00:06:00.081]  First of all, it's rigged.
[00:06:00.641 --> 00:06:03.143]  And I'm afraid the election's gonna be rigged, I have to be honest.
[00:06:03.823 --> 00:06:07.604]  And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's going to be taken away from us.
[00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:11.325]  America teaches everybody how to live in, quote, democracy.
[00:06:11.745 --> 00:06:12.205]  But what?
[00:06:12.585 --> 00:06:15.566]  You actually believe that they have democratic elections there?
[00:06:15.926 --> 00:06:24.148]  If Hillary steals the nomination and then she openly is engaged in chicanery and things don't add up with Trump, you have to say it must be thrown out.
[00:06:24.648 --> 00:06:33.351]  Hillary Clinton has had every advantage, every break given to her from the very beginning by this Democratic Party.
[00:06:33.451 --> 00:06:34.371]  It has been rigged.
[00:06:34.451 --> 00:06:37.232]  The political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[00:06:38.193 --> 00:06:39.673]  Contrary to popular belief.
[00:06:40.053 --> 00:06:41.594]  Then why are they holding the primaries?
[00:06:42.586 --> 00:06:43.787]  That's a very good question.
[00:06:43.927 --> 00:06:58.179]  It is clearly the case that when given truth serum, Debbie Wasserman Schultz vastly prefers Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, obviously, and to the extent there are things that can be done institutionally and marginally to facilitate that outcome, they are being done.
[00:06:58.299 --> 00:07:03.263]  When did the press see it as their role to protect the prerogative of the powerful?
[00:07:03.323 --> 00:07:04.104]  Actually, I think that's part of
[00:07:04.565 --> 00:07:08.272]  And we're not going to recognize Queen Hillary if there's evidence of fraud.
[00:07:08.572 --> 00:07:09.454]  And guess what there is?
[00:07:09.715 --> 00:07:11.598]  She stole the nomination!
[00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:14.043]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[00:07:14.103 --> 00:07:14.824]  What does that mean?
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.420]  How would the party pick a new nominee?
[00:07:17.641 --> 00:07:18.561]  Today is the day!
[00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:22.162]  They're really thinking about maybe getting him off the top of the ticket.
[00:07:22.382 --> 00:07:25.062]  He now looks increasingly like the Kamikaze kid.
[00:07:25.663 --> 00:07:28.543]  An implosion the likes of which I have never seen.
[00:07:28.563 --> 00:07:31.724]  The biggest problem we have is we have a very dishonest media.
[00:07:32.404 --> 00:07:43.067]  If Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country.
[00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.193]  Including in places like Texas.
[00:07:49.456 --> 00:07:50.057]  That's ridiculous.
[00:07:50.177 --> 00:07:51.178]  That doesn't make any sense.
[00:07:51.258 --> 00:07:53.160]  And I don't think anybody would take that seriously.
[00:07:53.821 --> 00:07:57.185]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars is now controlling the narrative.
[00:07:57.646 --> 00:08:03.193]  Go to InfoWars.com for more information and InfoWarsStore.com to support the fight for truth.
[00:08:18.306 --> 00:08:19.306]  You want answers?
[00:08:19.907 --> 00:08:22.367]  Or so does he.
[00:08:22.527 --> 00:08:29.750]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.271]  When we talk about technocracy...
[00:08:34.131 --> 00:08:42.435]  We talk about the globalist own definition of it from Davos a few years ago when the world leaders were meeting with the corporate owners of the planet.
[00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:55.201]  And they said it will be where one large central committee with pre-programmed computers controls everything you do, everything you eat, where you go, what you're allowed to engage in, what jobs you can have, and...
[00:08:56.346 --> 00:09:03.935]  Once the technocracy is in place, no one will be able to oppose it, because it's designed to first get you completely dependent on it, where you can't live without it.
[00:09:05.036 --> 00:09:08.260]  That's what they call Silicon Checkmate.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.243]  And here's an article out of the Express News today.
[00:09:13.366 --> 00:09:16.990]  Google's smart cars will be able to detect exactly where the police are.
[00:09:18.285 --> 00:09:19.846]  But it's okay, they're robots.
[00:09:20.306 --> 00:09:21.427]  But who runs the robots?
[00:09:21.527 --> 00:09:31.172]  And see, then, of course, the police are demanding access to the system that remote controls the cars, and Google's saying, of course, we'll put it in your cars, too, for the officer's safety.
[00:09:32.853 --> 00:09:38.616]  And so it creates a digital race where everyone then interfaces with this, and you can be completely taken over.
[00:09:41.758 --> 00:09:43.839]  This is the Technotronic plan.
[00:09:46.377 --> 00:10:10.535]  And I can use a cheesy analogy of a TV series I actually watched the first year of, six, seven, eight years ago on treadmill, when I would get on the treadmill every day, and that was the remake of Battlestar Galactica, where all the Battlestars get taken over because they're high-tech and they've got the latest systems in them, which of course the infiltrating Cylons had already, quote, developed the technology and basically given it to them.
[00:10:12.537 --> 00:10:13.978]  And then it was too late when they got hit.
[00:10:15.811 --> 00:10:22.534]  Now, I use the analogy of a TV show, science fiction, because the public needs to understand, this is not my opinion.
[00:10:23.254 --> 00:10:28.836]  Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote a book, the technotronic era, back in the 70s, admitting this whole plan.
[00:10:31.237 --> 00:10:39.880]  And admitting the government ships in the drugs, and the government runs the child kidnapping rings, and his argument is, well that's how we control it.
[00:10:42.321 --> 00:10:43.582]  That's how we keep it smaller.
[00:10:44.941 --> 00:10:49.126]  No, you notice it gets bigger and more out of control the more you, quote, control it.
[00:10:49.907 --> 00:10:52.469]  Very, very Machiavelli.
[00:10:53.531 --> 00:11:03.742]  And the truth is about globalism, it was sold as this wonderful way to take the technology of the West, export it to the third world, build them up,
[00:11:05.745 --> 00:11:09.066]  To then actually create a system of global stability.
[00:11:09.306 --> 00:11:16.568]  But instead, the top globalists have been using it to screw everybody over, consolidate power, and cause massive population problems.
[00:11:17.329 --> 00:11:20.230]  It was rolled out 65 years ago to actually reduce population.
[00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.570]  It did the opposite because there was a double cross.
[00:11:23.471 --> 00:11:27.052]  I was having a discussion with my father about that yesterday.
[00:11:29.244 --> 00:11:35.067]  Back when he was going to UT in the 60s, they were openly pushing world government and eugenics and everything else, the Plan 2 students.
[00:11:35.808 --> 00:11:37.689]  That's people that had been in college when they were in high school.
[00:11:38.689 --> 00:11:43.492]  And it was just all a giant double-cross of all the well-meaning little minions of the system.
[00:11:43.792 --> 00:11:45.713]  If you want to be double-crossed, that's up to you.
[00:11:46.113 --> 00:11:46.433]  I don't.
[00:11:47.514 --> 00:11:50.576]  Because the World Government Project is fundamentally anti-human.
[00:11:51.356 --> 00:11:55.318]  Now that's the first article I wanted to just open the salvo with today.
[00:11:55.598 --> 00:11:58.500]  And I've got a whole stack of technology news that that ties into.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:11.656]  And how there's an epidemic of depression, an epidemic of brain damage, even in pets in your home, and neurological disorders there.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.444]  It's a cornucopia, a cocktail of reasons, but...
[00:12:18.959 --> 00:12:27.504]  It's the GMO food integrated with humans with screen time that lowers dopamine levels and basically creates a zombified state.
[00:12:27.984 --> 00:12:28.985]  That's in the news today.
[00:12:29.265 --> 00:12:32.687]  But don't worry, Royal Navy unveils robot spy speedboat.
[00:12:34.408 --> 00:12:41.352]  And it's just a boat humans would be on, but now the central system can run it and cover up whatever it wants.
[00:12:41.472 --> 00:12:44.553]  Pet dementia blamed on lazy lifestyles and poor diets.
[00:12:44.653 --> 00:12:45.114]  Yes.
[00:12:46.909 --> 00:12:49.831]  Researchers confront an epidemic of loneliness.
[00:12:50.191 --> 00:12:53.454]  The more we get interfaced with machines, the more lonely we are.
[00:12:54.194 --> 00:12:55.595]  I'm sure it's not by design.
[00:12:56.376 --> 00:12:57.316]  And it goes on and on.
[00:12:57.636 --> 00:13:00.659]  Daily Mail, though attacks CrossFit.
[00:13:00.699 --> 00:13:01.719]  Yes, don't exercise.
[00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:02.340]  Whatever you do.
[00:13:04.341 --> 00:13:07.383]  Now, let's, let me, I'm not even hitting top stories right now.
[00:13:07.423 --> 00:13:09.445]  I'm just giving you a little sampling here of what we have.
[00:13:10.105 --> 00:13:13.387]  Conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly, dead at 92.
[00:13:15.117 --> 00:13:25.239]  We interviewed her just about a month ago, and I do want to sometime this week take that 20-minute interview and re-air it here on the broadcast.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:36.502]  And she even wrote a column the day she died, and that was published in WorldNetDaily, WND.com, it's up on DrudgeReport.com, right dead smack in the middle.
[00:13:37.532 --> 00:13:37.852]  I don't know.
[00:13:58.897 --> 00:13:59.237]  I think?
[00:14:12.665 --> 00:14:13.885]  And just somebody who works so hard.
[00:14:13.925 --> 00:14:19.067]  She would work even in her 90s, 5, 10, 15 hours a day, depending on which day of the week, doing radio interviews.
[00:14:19.808 --> 00:14:22.229]  Phyllis Schlafly, the leading pioneer of the American conservative movement.
[00:14:22.249 --> 00:14:23.749]  I want to get her son on, by the way.
[00:14:23.769 --> 00:14:28.151]  It was going to be her daughter, but her daughter, unfortunately, double-crossed her with Ted Cruz.
[00:14:28.611 --> 00:14:29.971]  So she's not running things now.
[00:14:29.991 --> 00:14:31.132]  We need to get her son on.
[00:14:31.372 --> 00:14:33.353]  The broadcasts continue on promoting the Eagle Forum.
[00:14:34.013 --> 00:14:38.955]  Phyllis Schlafly, the leading pioneer of America's conservative movement, dead at the age of 92.
[00:14:40.896 --> 00:14:43.957]  Can I have this to say about her in the article we wrote for Infowars.com?
[00:14:45.577 --> 00:14:51.759]  She is and was, or you can say she was and is, but she is, she will live on.
[00:14:52.119 --> 00:14:55.520]  She is and was an icon of human liberty.
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.661]  Without trailblazers like her, we would have no chance against the forces of tyranny.
[00:15:03.602 --> 00:15:07.323]  And her work will live on forever, especially, obviously, if the species survives.
[00:15:07.843 --> 00:15:12.524]  But don't worry, Twitter users mock Phyllis Schlafly, celebrate her death, Daily Caller reports.
[00:15:14.064 --> 00:15:15.365]  Then, of course, there's her last column.
[00:15:15.625 --> 00:15:16.645]  Very important article to read.
[00:15:16.765 --> 00:15:17.765]  Very presidential.
[00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:20.206]  Very detente-ish.
[00:15:20.326 --> 00:15:21.186]  Very classy.
[00:15:21.526 --> 00:15:24.107]  Trump in Mexico recalls Reagan in Geneva.
[00:15:24.127 --> 00:15:26.807]  I'm going to cover some of that today, if we have time.
[00:15:27.067 --> 00:15:29.788]  But everyone should go read the column.
[00:15:31.215 --> 00:15:40.541]  Now, getting into the economic news, and I'm going to plow into all these stories in more detail today, this is just alarm bells over the top.
[00:15:42.202 --> 00:15:53.469]  Now, when the Russians announced this last Friday, there were articles pooh-poohing it in the Financial Times of London and other places, but Russia and Saudi Arabia are now discussing oil production freeze.
[00:15:53.989 --> 00:15:55.210]  Russian energy minister
[00:15:56.138 --> 00:15:58.861]  They kind of counter what's been going on in other areas, creating this big glut.
[00:15:59.341 --> 00:16:03.625]  Prices have fallen from $114 per barrel to $45 to $50.
[00:16:05.107 --> 00:16:07.889]  But by today, the effects were seen.
[00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:13.675]  Treasuries climb, dollar falls as traders trim Fed hike wagers.
[00:16:14.195 --> 00:16:19.060]  That's right, the Fed is talking about increasing interest rates.
[00:16:21.061 --> 00:16:24.963]  Oil prices jump up to Russia and Saudi Arabia create market stability task force.
[00:16:25.323 --> 00:16:26.664]  So that's big economic news.
[00:16:26.684 --> 00:16:29.025]  We're going to be looking at all of that today as well.
[00:16:29.865 --> 00:16:36.229]  But first, this will take some time today because we need to probably air all of it even though it's very irritating to listen to.
[00:16:37.535 --> 00:16:53.608]  Hillary's always irritating, but I have to tell you it's a little bit of a silver lining when you realize that she is a dangerous threat, clear and present danger, by every barometric, by every yardstick, by every algorithm, by every historical lens through which we stare.
[00:16:54.588 --> 00:17:01.574]  Our little moral mortal coils blowing in the intergalactic breeze.
[00:17:03.766 --> 00:17:09.029]  Hillary Clinton's coughing fits, and then her coming out and saying it's a conspiracy theory, and she starts coughing during it.
[00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:13.331]  Those who the gods would destroy, they first make mad.
[00:17:13.351 --> 00:17:15.232]  Again, I forget who said that, but it's certainly true.
[00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:19.596]  And we've got massive coverage at Infowars.com on this.
[00:17:20.076 --> 00:17:23.539]  Dreadreport.com, as usual, has the full spectrum analysis, including one of our stories.
[00:17:23.959 --> 00:17:26.601]  Media caught in blatant lie to cover up Hillary's coughing fits.
[00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:30.624]  The type of things she says she's allergic to was actually low.
[00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:32.445]  Grasses were medium.
[00:17:32.585 --> 00:17:34.146]  Others overall were low.
[00:17:34.206 --> 00:17:38.489]  So local news says it was low to medium, but the media said it was extremely high.
[00:17:38.509 --> 00:17:40.490]  In fact, record high.
[00:17:40.671 --> 00:17:42.051]  But she barely finished her speech.
[00:17:42.092 --> 00:17:43.372]  No, she had to stop her speech.
[00:17:43.392 --> 00:17:45.494]  You can clearly see she just stops and cuts it off.
[00:17:48.507 --> 00:17:49.548]  I have a mold allergy.
[00:17:49.988 --> 00:17:53.891]  It makes me cough when I go for a jog or a hike for hours out in the middle of it when it's super high.
[00:17:53.911 --> 00:17:56.312]  It's been raining here for months and months.
[00:17:56.793 --> 00:17:57.693]  That's how Texas works.
[00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:01.356]  It's either dry or wet depending on, you know, what cycle you're in.
[00:18:03.417 --> 00:18:10.362]  And so, yeah, some days I'll cough some, but it's for a couple minutes, you know, total in the day, 30 seconds here, 10 seconds there.
[00:18:11.701 --> 00:18:14.583]  Hillary can't give a press conference because of it.
[00:18:14.643 --> 00:18:17.425]  She can't get back from the bathroom on time during a debate.
[00:18:17.445 --> 00:18:18.525]  Everybody has to wait five minutes.
[00:18:19.066 --> 00:18:22.308]  She seriously has health problems.
[00:18:22.348 --> 00:18:27.551]  She talks about Parkinson's medication in her own WikiLeaks documents.
[00:18:28.972 --> 00:18:32.415]  And now one of the top trending hashtags is Hillary's wheelchair.
[00:18:33.123 --> 00:18:43.947]  Which, of course, is from a month ago with our Secret Service sources that said that they have upwards of over $250,000 of equipment to lower her in and out of vehicles.
[00:18:43.967 --> 00:18:48.709]  Well, we finally have photos of her going in fundraisers and here is this thing with a big lowering back.
[00:18:48.729 --> 00:18:51.050]  I was thinking it was lowering meals on the side.
[00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.171]  The Secret Service is like, no, it's more sophisticated.
[00:18:53.451 --> 00:18:54.672]  We now have photos of it.
[00:18:57.921 --> 00:18:59.902]  So, very, very interesting.
[00:19:00.643 --> 00:19:04.565]  But it appears that she's just sitting in the back and then gets out once she gets there.
[00:19:04.605 --> 00:19:07.247]  So she's in serious, serious health decline.
[00:19:07.267 --> 00:19:10.309]  She has a guy following her around with a tranquilizer pen.
[00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:20.115]  And now it's been confirmed by Page Six, New York Post, CNN demanded Dr. Drew retract health comments and he wouldn't do it.
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.221]  That ties into this.
[00:19:22.901 --> 00:19:23.562]  Shut it down.
[00:19:23.642 --> 00:19:26.865]  Reuters orders cameramen to kill positive Trump footage.
[00:19:27.646 --> 00:19:28.446]  And why is that important?
[00:19:28.466 --> 00:19:33.411]  Because Right Side News and others, they get, they pay Reuters and then they get, we ought to do that too.
[00:19:33.991 --> 00:19:38.515]  You go to Thomson Reuters and you pay and that's how people stream and get these feeds all over the country.
[00:19:38.775 --> 00:19:41.578]  Can't afford to send somebody as a small media outlet everywhere in the country.
[00:19:41.838 --> 00:19:44.560]  But see, Reuters, you hear them saying, hey, the orders are cut it off.
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:45.902]  No, we're not going to show this.
[00:19:46.874 --> 00:19:52.976]  Just like CNN's been caught censoring, just like they're always cutting feeds, there's massive censorships by these central hubs.
[00:19:53.316 --> 00:19:54.757]  This time it's been caught on video.
[00:19:56.798 --> 00:19:57.398]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:19:57.438 --> 00:20:02.860]  Hillary Blaine's lengthy coughing fit on Trump allergy isn't that just special.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.541]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:20:04.641 --> 00:20:05.421]  Big broadcast.
[00:20:05.461 --> 00:20:06.602]  We're only 20 minutes into it.
[00:20:06.902 --> 00:20:07.362]  Stay with us.
[00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.071]  Infowars is changing the world for the better.
[00:20:18.691 --> 00:20:21.051]  And that means you're changing the world for the better.
[00:20:21.611 --> 00:20:25.372]  When listeners call in and thank me for what I've done, I tell them, are you kidding?
[00:20:25.852 --> 00:20:39.775]  You're the reason we're on the map, spreading the word about the broadcast, telling your friends and family about the show, praying for us, buying the books, the videos, the Hillary for prison shirts that have become one of the major memes of this election.
[00:20:40.555 --> 00:20:44.697]  This election is a referendum on the crimes of George Soros and his puppet Hillary Clinton.
[00:20:45.257 --> 00:20:52.340]  They've already been shaken to their very core by the fact that over 100,000 of these t-shirts are now on the streets across the United States.
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.001]  Let's double that number.
[00:20:54.601 --> 00:20:56.842]  Let's put bumper stickers on all of our cars.
[00:20:57.082 --> 00:21:01.183]  Let's expose the fact that we're aware of these people's agenda and say we're not afraid of you, bully.
[00:21:01.764 --> 00:21:02.944]  We're never going to shut up.
[00:21:03.204 --> 00:21:04.425]  We're never going to back down.
[00:21:04.845 --> 00:21:06.866]  Because ideas are bulletproof.
[00:21:08.067 --> 00:21:15.013]  Most of the 100,000 shirts that we've sold in the last 15 months or so, we've sold at or near cost.
[00:21:15.913 --> 00:21:23.259]  And ladies and gentlemen, right through to the election, we are going to be selling the shirts at cost for $9.95.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:31.126]  That's $5 for the shirt, $5 for shipping and handling, including all the taxes and the rest of it that we have to pay.
[00:21:31.486 --> 00:21:33.628]  So in many cases, we're actually losing money on this.
[00:21:34.548 --> 00:21:37.231]  But what we saw happen in Cleveland was so amazing,
[00:21:37.981 --> 00:21:48.485]  Where there were tens of thousands of the shirts on the street, big banners we paid for, being towed through the sky, saying Hillary for prison, getting international news attention.
[00:21:48.785 --> 00:21:49.565]  It was amazing.
[00:21:50.345 --> 00:21:59.888]  And it showed not just the mainstream media or the corrupt government, but we the people, the fact that the Liberty Movement is actually incredibly strong and incredibly popular.
[00:22:00.469 --> 00:22:02.689]  And it also showed Donald Trump that.
[00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.971]  The truth is, Americans are hungry for liberty.
[00:22:07.847 --> 00:22:12.509]  But people all over the world are hungry for liberty as well, and are aware of the globalist takeover of this planet.
[00:22:13.369 --> 00:22:20.652]  And so even if Hillary has gotten off her crimes so far, because of the incredible corruption of the Justice Department, it doesn't matter.
[00:22:21.012 --> 00:22:24.033]  We are convicting her in the court of public opinion.
[00:22:24.693 --> 00:22:29.895]  That's why she's come out and said I'm one of her main enemies, and called me Dark Heart Alex Jones.
[00:22:30.635 --> 00:22:33.056]  Because the truth is, I don't have a dark heart.
[00:22:33.596 --> 00:22:45.462]  I have a loving heart, just like our listeners and viewers do, and we have the courage, you have the courage, to wear these shirts openly and to meet like-minded people, and to stir conversation with others, and hopefully inform them.
[00:22:45.962 --> 00:22:48.423]  Many of you have already gotten your Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[00:22:48.723 --> 00:22:49.744]  You've helped spread the word.
[00:22:50.184 --> 00:22:53.465]  You've created what's probably the most popular meme of the 2016 historic election.
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:23:01.184]  I'm asking you to go to the next level and order another shirt today and give it to friends, neighbors, family.
[00:23:02.065 --> 00:23:09.511]  I'm also asking you to take the bumper stickers that say Hillary for prison in each order and put them on your cars or put them in public places where it's legal and lawful.
[00:23:10.091 --> 00:23:19.438]  Because this message absolutely has to punch through the media, as Donald Trump has said, and expose the fact that she may have corrupt courts and the corrupt Justice Department
[00:23:20.459 --> 00:23:24.341]  No bill her for being indicted, but in the court of public opinion, we're taking action.
[00:23:24.841 --> 00:23:34.705]  When Hillary Clinton threatens us, when Hillary Clinton turns her dogs loose on us, when Hillary Clinton has mainstream media basically death threat us, we don't back down, we go to the next level.
[00:23:35.325 --> 00:23:46.213]  That's why I'm encouraging you, if you haven't got the t-shirts, to join all the other great InfoWarriors in history and get your Hillary for Prison 2016 shirt today.
[00:23:46.733 --> 00:24:00.963]  But whether it's a Molon Labe shirt, or a Come and Take It shirt, or an InfoWars.com shirt, you get InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding the very front lines of the fight against the globalists in America's darkest hour.
[00:24:29.259 --> 00:24:38.707]  By the way, I don't mention this to be shocking, but I'm going to show it later on the TV portion of the transmission.
[00:24:41.209 --> 00:24:47.314]  This is the Daily Mirror mutant pig with human face and penis on forehead caught on camera in China.
[00:24:49.196 --> 00:24:52.379]  Now, this is what China has been doing with chimeras for decades.
[00:24:54.352 --> 00:24:59.635]  China sells in stores for more than a decade human milk produced by cows that are part human.
[00:25:01.156 --> 00:25:13.863]  And even when they make the cow maybe just 5%, 6%, 7% human, there will be mutations down the road unless you produce the next offspring from clones that are mutated.
[00:25:16.605 --> 00:25:19.166]  But this is the type of stuff that's going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:21.588 --> 00:25:21.908]  Okay?
[00:25:21.968 --> 00:25:23.969]  I mean, this is how overwhelming the news has gotten.
[00:25:26.021 --> 00:25:34.209]  Now Obama landed yesterday in China, and I saw Trump talking about this right when it happened.
[00:25:34.249 --> 00:25:38.073]  You notice when Obama just landed, he had to get off the back of the plane, no red carpet.
[00:25:39.315 --> 00:25:41.356]  I mean normally you do that for a major ambassador.
[00:25:41.917 --> 00:25:44.038]  This is unprecedented for a major president.
[00:25:44.238 --> 00:25:45.239]  It's a major insult.
[00:25:45.539 --> 00:26:00.408]  The media began saying within minutes he was a conspiracy theorist until all the diplomats and everybody else came out and said no this is a huge insult especially in Asia where it's all about you know honor and you know showing a good face to things and ceremony.
[00:26:00.428 --> 00:26:04.791]  It was a huge insult to make him get off the back of the plane and then Chinese officials
[00:26:06.752 --> 00:26:14.939]  When Obama's advance staff got off, yelled at him, hey, this is our airport, this is our country, we'll do whatever we want.
[00:26:17.352 --> 00:26:22.034]  So again, this is all shot by Reuters, who then cut the feed, because they didn't want you to see exactly what happens.
[00:26:22.054 --> 00:26:27.816]  We only have what somebody shot on a cell phone, and the audio's not too good, but I wish Fox News was able to tune it up a little bit.
[00:26:27.836 --> 00:26:29.977]  But let's play a clip of this.
[00:26:30.017 --> 00:26:34.659]  This is all about dragging America through the mud and teaching us that we're trash.
[00:26:34.699 --> 00:26:36.480]  That's what Obama's all about.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.861]  It's about America's nothing, globalism is everything.
[00:26:38.901 --> 00:26:39.221]  Here it is.
[00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:48.091]  This is our country, our airport.
[00:26:48.111 --> 00:26:53.273]  There's longer clips up on InfoWars.com and obviously on the news because I watched them this morning.
[00:26:54.774 --> 00:26:56.175]  Now, think about this.
[00:26:56.215 --> 00:26:57.035]  What's the message here?
[00:26:58.896 --> 00:27:07.381]  Never before would a president even get off a plane if it was ordered to get off the back and you're not supposed to have the ceremony and have the quote honor guard and all the rest of it.
[00:27:08.481 --> 00:27:11.323]  I personally don't like popping circumstance, but that's what they do.
[00:27:11.723 --> 00:27:13.624]  And that's what the Chinese president gets when he comes here.
[00:27:14.434 --> 00:27:17.376]  The problem is China already bosses Hollywood around.
[00:27:17.837 --> 00:27:23.241]  China is the most evil country on earth and has killed 80 plus million of its own people under one leader alone.
[00:27:23.582 --> 00:27:25.303]  They have mobile execution vans in every city.
[00:27:25.523 --> 00:27:28.386]  If you smart mouth the government, they chop your testicles off.
[00:27:28.466 --> 00:27:29.426]  I mean, that's what they do.
[00:27:30.467 --> 00:27:32.469]  And then stab you a few times and bleed to death on the street.
[00:27:32.689 --> 00:27:35.532]  The public will not help you or they get put in a forced labor camp.
[00:27:36.312 --> 00:27:40.356]  If you're caught practicing even mild Buddhism exercises, you are given
[00:27:41.471 --> 00:27:42.773]  Life in prison if you're lucky.
[00:27:42.853 --> 00:27:51.542]  If not, you are put in a facility, blood-tested type, ready to have your organs harvested as soon as a rich westerner is ready for the surgeries.
[00:27:53.565 --> 00:27:59.091]  And see, oh, the little trendy Ivy League, you know, feminist ladies want to get off and boss the Chinese around?
[00:27:59.111 --> 00:28:01.594]  And they're just like, hey, it's our country.
[00:28:01.734 --> 00:28:02.174]  Get out of here.
[00:28:02.194 --> 00:28:02.675]  It's our airport.
[00:28:04.653 --> 00:28:05.754]  These are real tyrants.
[00:28:05.794 --> 00:28:08.096]  These are people that really get their hands in the blood.
[00:28:08.776 --> 00:28:11.098]  They suppress thousands of riots a month.
[00:28:11.919 --> 00:28:13.781]  They kill millions of their own people a year.
[00:28:13.841 --> 00:28:18.765]  They go and get little baby girls and drown them or keep them for body parts harvesting.
[00:28:21.203 --> 00:28:23.524]  There's a billion, three hundred million people in China.
[00:28:23.965 --> 00:28:27.187]  And so you're going to swagger around with your Harvard degree and everything?
[00:28:27.487 --> 00:28:29.668]  You're going to be told, get off the back of the airplane.
[00:28:29.989 --> 00:28:31.209]  You're going to be told you're nothing.
[00:28:31.229 --> 00:28:33.411]  And we're going to chew you out on the tarmac.
[00:28:34.011 --> 00:28:36.413]  And I'm going to find, because I saw it this morning, the longer clip.
[00:28:37.033 --> 00:28:42.797]  Because, I mean, there's a bunch of this going on where they're just down there chewing people out.
[00:28:43.871 --> 00:28:52.915]  And you notice there's a big fracas outside the airplane and a bunch of people and Chinese officials smiling and getting off on it because this was about rubbing people's noses in it.
[00:28:53.755 --> 00:28:58.137]  And whereas I love seeing Obama get his nose rubbed in something, it's about rubbing our nose.
[00:28:58.157 --> 00:29:00.057]  We've given the communist Chinese the Panama Canal.
[00:29:00.277 --> 00:29:01.518]  We've given them most of our deep water ports.
[00:29:01.678 --> 00:29:03.079]  We've given them almost all of our industry.
[00:29:03.239 --> 00:29:06.240]  We've given them 97% of rare earth minerals worldwide.
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:11.682]  And now we're giving them all of our weapons secrets because the globalists are going to use China to take over the world.
[00:29:13.695 --> 00:29:15.558]  The globalists have sold us out to China.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:25.516]  Because China is the most brutal, eugenics-based system that makes Adolf Alois Hitler look like a amateur.
[00:29:27.088 --> 00:29:28.089]  An amateur!
[00:29:28.849 --> 00:29:29.730]  An amateur!
[00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:38.036]  Compared to the Communist Chinese, no one is more bloodthirsty, no one is more soulless, no one is more demonic, no one is more evil!
[00:29:38.596 --> 00:29:54.728]  That's why there's this fawning with George Soros and the Rockefellers and Rothschilds, a lot of them have moved to China a lot of the year, and just groveling in the satanicness of it, the anti-humanness of it, as they feed on over a billion slaves, with a tiny Communist Party sucking off of them!
[00:29:55.288 --> 00:29:56.891]  They now own the majority of our debt.
[00:29:57.091 --> 00:29:57.933]  We've been sold out.
[00:29:59.015 --> 00:29:59.916]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.417 --> 00:30:02.020]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.942 --> 00:30:05.646]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.914 --> 00:30:12.936]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:30:12.956 --> 00:30:15.738]  Conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly dead at 92.
[00:30:16.319 --> 00:30:19.281]  She is and was an icon of human liberty, said Alex Jones.
[00:30:19.602 --> 00:30:23.885]  Without trailblazers like her, we would have no chance against the forces of tyranny.
[00:30:24.446 --> 00:30:34.395]  Schlafly, a formidable pro-family grassroots organizer who was politically active for 70 years, founded the Conservative Eagle Forum in 1972 and served as president since then.
[00:30:34.895 --> 00:30:38.436]  Overseeing the organization's rise to 80,000 members today.
[00:30:38.816 --> 00:30:45.518]  Her focus from her earliest days until her final ones was protecting the family, which she understood as the building block of life.
[00:30:45.878 --> 00:30:51.680]  The Eagle Forum said in a statement she recognized America as the greatest political embodiment of those values.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:31:03.114]  From military superiority and defense to immigration and trade, from unborn life to the nuclear family and parenthood, Phyllis Schlafly was a courageous and articulate voice for common sense and traditional values.

[00:31:10.017 --> 00:31:11.838]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:11.898 --> 00:31:13.778]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:13.938 --> 00:31:16.739]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:16.839 --> 00:31:22.701]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:22.901 --> 00:31:31.763]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.

[00:31:39.627 --> 00:31:47.332]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:47.652 --> 00:31:48.613]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:49.842 --> 00:31:52.144]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:53.205 --> 00:31:57.189]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:57.349 --> 00:32:03.835]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:32:04.055 --> 00:32:08.159]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4wrestore.com.
[00:32:10.006 --> 00:32:11.387]  Clean, pure drinking water.

[00:32:13.147 --> 00:32:14.048]  But where do you get it?
[00:32:14.348 --> 00:32:20.110]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:26.052]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:32:26.252 --> 00:32:43.116]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:32:43.496 --> 00:32:45.616]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:32:45.997 --> 00:32:47.177]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:32:47.457 --> 00:32:48.217]  Easy assembly.
[00:32:48.497 --> 00:32:49.117]  Low maintenance.
[00:32:49.417 --> 00:32:51.217]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:33:18.808 --> 00:33:21.697]  Another time in the age of wonder.
[00:33:37.188 --> 00:33:41.111]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:41.791 --> 00:33:51.338]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:52.439 --> 00:33:54.460]  Hillary Clinton is crashing and burning.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:55.501]  Emblematic.
[00:33:56.902 --> 00:33:57.382]  Iconic.
[00:34:00.664 --> 00:34:01.305]  Keep falling.
[00:34:04.102 --> 00:34:10.508]  And it's all a signature, a signet, of the establishment itself.
[00:34:10.648 --> 00:34:12.569]  Disrespected worldwide, hated.
[00:34:13.931 --> 00:34:16.993]  Communist China doesn't let their government get infiltrated like ours does.
[00:34:17.494 --> 00:34:19.696]  Russia doesn't let their government get infiltrated like we do.
[00:34:21.577 --> 00:34:25.400]  Germany was captured after World War II, that's why it's run by the globalists.
[00:34:27.963 --> 00:34:30.505]  England is where this system of control basically comes from.
[00:34:32.773 --> 00:34:36.277]  But in through the outdoor, it's now trying to pull out of its own system.
[00:34:37.598 --> 00:34:41.022]  And the United States has been the big muscle for all of it.
[00:34:42.504 --> 00:34:45.107]  I'm gonna get into the coughing fits now, and I'm gonna play it all.
[00:34:45.768 --> 00:34:50.133]  The entire coughing fit, when she had to stop her speech in Cleveland.
[00:34:52.892 --> 00:34:59.935]  Then her so-called first press conference in 270 plus days, which was not a press conference, it was to a group of fawning sycophantic women.
[00:34:59.955 --> 00:35:07.478]  I'm going to show you photos, not just a video of her speaking, but how they were fawning on the other side.
[00:35:07.999 --> 00:35:11.240]  Looking at her like she was a goddess incarnate.
[00:35:13.021 --> 00:35:15.542]  And then we're going to show her talking about conspiracy theorists.
[00:35:19.551 --> 00:35:21.893]  This is why the press never asks Hillary real questions.
[00:35:21.953 --> 00:35:26.656]  They look like a bunch of fawning schoolgirls.
[00:35:30.259 --> 00:35:31.740]  That's what Paul Joseph Watson tweeted.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.542]  This is why the press never asks Hillary real questions.
[00:35:34.562 --> 00:35:38.364]  They look like enraptured tweenies meeting Taylor Swift.
[00:35:39.465 --> 00:35:41.286]  Truly disgusting.
[00:35:41.787 --> 00:35:44.669]  But that's like North Korea whenever Kim Jong-un died.
[00:35:44.689 --> 00:35:47.411]  Or Kim Jong-il, sorry, Freudian slip.
[00:35:49.795 --> 00:35:55.681]  Three days of crying and yelling and beating your chest, because if you didn't, you'd get sent to a forced labor camp, or worse.
[00:35:56.501 --> 00:36:02.967]  And then when he would walk by, or his son walks by, you have to look at him like you're just so amazed, like, oh my gosh, you're so incredible.
[00:36:07.632 --> 00:36:11.516]  And this is who's going to take over the power structure of this country.
[00:36:11.796 --> 00:36:12.797]  You can say what you want.
[00:36:14.298 --> 00:36:25.080]  About our past leaders, but we really have soft, little twisted control freaks who think that they manage reality, they tell us how to talk, they tell us how to speak, they tell us what to think.
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:32.601]  Just like Gary Johnson when he's talking to a town hall reporter, says, listen, you don't use the word illegal immigrant.
[00:36:33.222 --> 00:36:33.822]  Is that understood?
[00:36:33.842 --> 00:36:34.902]  The guy's like, well, why not?
[00:36:34.942 --> 00:36:36.182]  He goes, yeah, I told you to!
[00:36:37.282 --> 00:36:39.223]  I mean, it's like, I control reality!
[00:36:39.343 --> 00:36:40.183]  I'm history's actor!
[00:36:42.409 --> 00:36:45.710]  We define language, we tell you what to do, do you understand?
[00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:47.271]  Go back into your trance!
[00:36:47.571 --> 00:36:48.592]  I'm the official!
[00:36:49.092 --> 00:36:49.932]  I'm the boss!
[00:36:50.453 --> 00:36:51.893]  Back into your trance!
[00:36:53.494 --> 00:36:57.836]  It's not weird to have a strange Nazi collaborator spending millions of dollars to overthrow the government.
[00:36:58.561 --> 00:37:00.362]  Who's already thrown a bunch of other governments over.
[00:37:00.743 --> 00:37:09.829]  It's not a big deal to have big global foundations funding Gary Johnson, whose VP running mate says he wants to ban guns and Gary Johnson wants open borders and have us run by the foreign TPP.
[00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:13.352]  It's okay because he talks real slow as a fake intellectual.
[00:37:13.933 --> 00:37:15.133]  He is our master!
[00:37:16.695 --> 00:37:18.576]  Come here, Von Helsing.
[00:37:19.817 --> 00:37:20.297]  No I won't.
[00:37:21.338 --> 00:37:22.379]  I said come here!
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.242]  You have a strong will for a man who's only lived one life.
[00:37:28.073 --> 00:37:33.737]  Gary Johnson has the will of a pile of dog manure.
[00:37:36.138 --> 00:37:36.898]  You're a joke!
[00:37:40.941 --> 00:37:44.983]  But Gary Johnson said he controls reality.
[00:37:45.363 --> 00:37:48.665]  Now that's, notice the reality's cute and sweet and funny and non-threatening.
[00:37:48.925 --> 00:37:49.666]  That's the cover.
[00:37:51.223 --> 00:37:56.044]  I'm surprised he doesn't have a little hand muppet in his hand singing songs to us about how much he loves us.
[00:37:56.424 --> 00:37:57.444]  I'm non-threatening.
[00:37:57.865 --> 00:37:59.525]  I've got an ice cream truck.
[00:38:00.165 --> 00:38:01.105]  I've got puppies.
[00:38:01.305 --> 00:38:02.306]  I've got candy.
[00:38:02.386 --> 00:38:03.966]  World government's good.
[00:38:04.586 --> 00:38:05.726]  Turn your guns in.
[00:38:06.006 --> 00:38:06.727]  Oh, we love you.
[00:38:06.967 --> 00:38:07.947]  Open the borders.
[00:38:08.007 --> 00:38:08.887]  La, la, la.
[00:38:09.247 --> 00:38:10.207]  I'm so liberal.
[00:38:10.348 --> 00:38:11.208]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:38:11.528 --> 00:38:12.648]  Gary Johnson.
[00:38:13.008 --> 00:38:13.568]  Vote for me.
[00:38:14.028 --> 00:38:14.629]  Stop Trump.
[00:38:15.069 --> 00:38:15.909]  I love Hillary.
[00:38:15.989 --> 00:38:16.949]  La, la, la, la.
[00:38:16.989 --> 00:38:17.249]  Sorry.
[00:38:17.269 --> 00:38:18.389]  Okay, I'm going to stop right now.
[00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:19.890]  Please take him off screen.
[00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:20.570]  I'm going to get serious.
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:29.744]  Okay, I'm going to plow through the Hillary coughing news, the huge economic news, a bunch of internet takeover news.
[00:38:30.224 --> 00:38:32.926]  Obama says the internet cannot be like the Wild Wild West.
[00:38:34.047 --> 00:38:36.889]  We have mutant pigs with human faces and a penis for a forehead.
[00:38:36.909 --> 00:38:39.310]  We just have the New World Order.
[00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:42.012]  We have the fruits of corruption.
[00:38:42.633 --> 00:38:43.693]  The wages of sin.
[00:38:44.234 --> 00:38:45.034]  We know what those are.
[00:38:48.076 --> 00:38:48.997]  Now, continuing here.
[00:38:50.629 --> 00:38:55.531]  Normally I only do this special once a year, I've been doing it every few months because the world's a crazy place.
[00:38:55.751 --> 00:39:09.778]  Anybody with half a brain knows that we all need to be self-sufficient, we all need to be prepared, we all need to be 70% involved politically trying to stop this new world order, but 30% of the time is my view getting ready.
[00:39:11.279 --> 00:39:14.721]  Major world war, globalism, economic crises,
[00:39:16.485 --> 00:39:23.107]  False flags, you name it, have gone from possibilities to probabilities to absolutes.
[00:39:23.507 --> 00:39:25.128]  It just depends on how intense.
[00:39:25.748 --> 00:39:31.990]  And the globalists are gauging us worldwide, populations wanting us to be dependent, wanting us to not be self-sufficient.
[00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:43.653]  That's why we have a symbiotic operation here with super high quality preparedness goods, shortwave radios, to water filtration systems, to solar panel systems that are the highest quality for the lowest price with great control units.
[00:39:46.403 --> 00:39:59.597]  And of course the widest spectrum of the highest quality storable food that lasts 25 years from my Patriots supply, private label, the exact same food, so that I can contractually give you 30 to 40% off.
[00:39:59.617 --> 00:40:03.041]  30% off their already lowest prices is unheard of.
[00:40:03.361 --> 00:40:07.686]  40%, which we can do on a few of the packs, or more than a few, a bunch of them, is unbelievable.
[00:40:08.479 --> 00:40:10.521]  Because September is Preparedness Month.
[00:40:10.601 --> 00:40:13.184]  New Preparedness Mega Specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:40:13.384 --> 00:40:19.310]  To celebrate National Preparedness Month, we are giving you up to 40% off on our top-selling preparedness items at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:40:19.651 --> 00:40:25.457]  Some of the Preparedness Mega Specials at InfoWarsStore.com include 30-40% off InfoWars Select storable food.
[00:40:25.657 --> 00:40:27.539]  We call it InfoWars Select, meaning it's high quality.
[00:40:27.579 --> 00:40:28.340]  It's the full spectrum.
[00:40:29.381 --> 00:40:32.163]  20% off Survival Shield X2 Niacin Iodine, an absolute.
[00:40:32.183 --> 00:40:37.749]  20% off Alexa Pure Air Filters, 20% off Alexa Pure Water Filters and many, many others.
[00:40:38.189 --> 00:40:39.590]  With everything going on in the world right now...
[00:40:40.791 --> 00:40:43.253]  It is now more important than ever to start getting prepared.
[00:40:43.273 --> 00:40:48.136]  I have an emergency food supply that I've actually expanded for my family and even for the entire office here.
[00:40:48.176 --> 00:40:56.583]  I've stockpiled food, solar panel systems, gas generators, firearms, security, personnel, yeah, the world.
[00:40:56.623 --> 00:40:57.563]  We've never done any of this.
[00:40:57.643 --> 00:40:58.304]  Okay?
[00:40:58.364 --> 00:41:01.126]  I mean, you can feel it, you can see it, you can smell it.
[00:41:01.366 --> 00:41:01.806]  Get ready.
[00:41:02.307 --> 00:41:03.448]  Drums, drums in the deep.
[00:41:04.485 --> 00:41:09.030]  Visit infowarrestore.com and get up to 40% off of our top selling preparedness products.
[00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:10.271]  All supplies last.
[00:41:10.291 --> 00:41:11.432]  We can't do this very long.
[00:41:11.692 --> 00:41:13.374]  We do it for like a week usually and then have to stop.
[00:41:13.875 --> 00:41:14.796]  Now I'm doing it every few months.
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:20.203]  Also experienced the power of bio-true selenium that will sell out very, very soon.
[00:41:20.223 --> 00:41:25.928]  It was going to sell out last week with a big spike in orders, but then I didn't, I stopped plugging why it's so good and it slowed down.
[00:41:25.948 --> 00:41:31.812]  But I'm going to just tell you, this is the very best selenium out there from our research from mustard seed, a really powerful dose of it.
[00:41:32.293 --> 00:41:34.595]  Electrochemical activities are impossible in the body.
[00:41:34.635 --> 00:41:35.716]  That's all cellular activity.
[00:41:35.936 --> 00:41:42.081]  Without selenium, the government's always saying you need less and less of this, just like you need more and more fluoride because they care about you and your family.
[00:41:42.741 --> 00:41:45.343]  No, because the eugenicists at the top are hell-bent on destroying us.
[00:41:45.684 --> 00:41:51.388]  And even the vast majority of EPA scientists, in fact 99% of them, have signed letters two separate times saying, please take fluoride out.
[00:41:51.668 --> 00:41:53.209]  So I'm not even blaming them, it's the people on top.
[00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:56.632]  Point is, you need good iodine.
[00:41:56.692 --> 00:42:02.056]  We only promote the highest quality, bioavailable, 99999 true iodine.
[00:42:05.711 --> 00:42:12.582]  And it goes perfectly with BioTrue Selenium, available at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:42:12.942 --> 00:42:14.966]  And part of the preparedness is 20% off X2.
[00:42:14.986 --> 00:42:19.453]  It's a great way to stock up on the True Iodine today as well.
[00:42:20.777 --> 00:42:31.042]  And that funding, again, will allow us to keep the reporters we have, and hopefully add a few more, and more writers and more researchers to be able to cover the field of what's actually happening and unfolding.
[00:42:31.702 --> 00:42:33.323]  Please support our local affiliates as well.
[00:42:33.343 --> 00:42:35.644]  Spread the word about the broadcast on your local MNM stations.
[00:42:35.984 --> 00:42:49.230]  Become a sponsor or support the local sponsors, and let them know why you're supporting them, or send $5, $10, $50, $100, or a cake to the local station, and thank them for what they are doing standing up for this republic.
[00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:50.130]  Okay.
[00:42:53.493 --> 00:42:54.915]  Let me start over on the whole Hillary thing.
[00:42:54.935 --> 00:43:01.803]  I already kind of did a basic setup, but I want to recap the compendium of what's been developing, then I want to get into the latest.
[00:43:02.884 --> 00:43:04.686]  We have the WikiLeaks of Hillary.
[00:43:04.786 --> 00:43:14.137]  Two weeks ago, they admit it's real that she was looking for anti-Parkinson's medication three years ago, saying she wanted a doctor that would prescribe her that.
[00:43:15.916 --> 00:43:30.660]  We know that she was in and out of the hospital in 2012, 2013, and spent almost a year in the hospital at facilities in Maryland and other areas that focus on brain tumors, brain surgery, brain injuries.
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:36.302]  We know now, the FBI released this last Friday, right before Labor Day, to bury it.
[00:43:37.462 --> 00:43:44.104]  We're going to bring it up today, that Hillary told them that she couldn't remember anything of what happened with the servers
[00:43:45.117 --> 00:43:47.018]  Because she had amnesia.
[00:43:49.279 --> 00:44:00.103]  She said she remembered nothing about any of the servers, any of the emails, or anything she'd done because of a traumatic brain injury, a lasting concussion.
[00:44:00.123 --> 00:44:02.504]  So, we have her saying, I need Parkinson's medication.
[00:44:02.684 --> 00:44:04.544]  We have her saying, I know nothing.
[00:44:07.265 --> 00:44:11.247]  Hillary's defense, can't recall after the fall.
[00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:14.905]  So, I could go on for hours.
[00:44:14.925 --> 00:44:28.377]  You have Dr. Drew, now confirmed, Page Six, New York Post, was kicked out of CNN Headline News because he said it looks like they're giving her horrible medications that absolutely mix wrong and I don't know what's going on.
[00:44:29.458 --> 00:44:32.260]  We have all these other people that are being censored.
[00:44:32.861 --> 00:44:35.283]  We have Google censoring keywords that deal with their health.
[00:44:37.256 --> 00:44:46.279]  So with all of this happening, DrugsReport.com has a blow-by-blow timeline of her coughing fits so many times I can't even read them all.
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:52.222]  But let's just cover what happened when she was in Ohio in one day.
[00:44:53.402 --> 00:44:55.363]  This all happened in one day.
[00:44:55.923 --> 00:44:58.224]  Can't give a speech, she's having such a coughing fit.
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.661]  Looks like she's bombed out of her brain on some type of medication.
[00:45:02.381 --> 00:45:05.142]  Goes on the airplane with sycophantic minions worshipping her.
[00:45:05.742 --> 00:45:11.984]  Has to stop the first press conference of 270 days that wasn't really a real press conference with her fawning minions.
[00:45:15.165 --> 00:45:19.966]  And then she comes out and calls it a conspiracy theory and says that she's allergic to Donald Trump.
[00:45:20.366 --> 00:45:21.687]  And it's all a big sick joke.
[00:45:21.967 --> 00:45:22.587]  It's all funny.
[00:45:23.607 --> 00:45:28.909]  The woman has serious health problems and the media has given us the credit
[00:45:30.359 --> 00:45:34.302]  Infowars.com for creating the quote, made-up theory.
[00:45:35.163 --> 00:45:38.466]  No, there are now 10 prominent doctors.
[00:45:38.966 --> 00:45:40.828]  We have it listed on Infowars.com.
[00:45:41.108 --> 00:45:42.169]  Drudge has it linked as well.
[00:45:42.189 --> 00:45:44.451]  In fact, I didn't find that in my stack.
[00:45:44.471 --> 00:45:45.192]  Will you guys print me that?
[00:45:45.692 --> 00:45:46.993]  Thank you.
[00:45:47.013 --> 00:45:54.880]  10 prominent doctors, including Democrats, including Obama's former medical doctor, say she needs a neurological independent panel.
[00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:57.643]  Well, we had Dr. Pachinik on saying the same thing.
[00:45:58.686 --> 00:46:01.107]  Ten prominent doctors question Hillary's health, World Net Daily.
[00:46:01.287 --> 00:46:01.567]  Okay?
[00:46:01.607 --> 00:46:02.347]  And that's just ten.
[00:46:03.728 --> 00:46:06.128]  That's the article I told Watson to write last week, but he was too busy.
[00:46:06.168 --> 00:46:07.669]  I said, there's got to be more than ten doctors.
[00:46:07.689 --> 00:46:08.969]  You know, that's always the proverbial article.
[00:46:08.989 --> 00:46:09.970]  You know, ten doctors.
[00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:10.590]  But, whatever.
[00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:11.730]  Point is, there it is.
[00:46:13.971 --> 00:46:15.611]  Ten prominent doctors.
[00:46:16.512 --> 00:46:16.912]  Okay?
[00:46:16.992 --> 00:46:18.632]  This is normal medical procedure.
[00:46:18.872 --> 00:46:20.573]  She isn't releasing her real medical records.
[00:46:21.673 --> 00:46:24.174]  She released what some family doctor from a decade ago had.
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:35.408]  Let's go ahead and go to her in Cleveland, having the coughing fit of coughing fits, and having a serious, serious problem, and then saying it's a conspiracy theory to question, and here it is.
[00:46:35.428 --> 00:46:40.472]  I want to thank Congresswoman Marcia Fudge for hosting us.
[00:46:54.688 --> 00:47:00.049]  I've been talking, so.
[00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:06.271]  Every time I think about Trump, I get allergic.
[00:47:06.291 --> 00:47:09.252]  Now she's doing Saturday Night Live jokes.
[00:47:09.972 --> 00:47:17.054]  She's dying up there.
[00:47:18.774 --> 00:47:21.155]  Boy, we have 63 days to go.
[00:47:24.144 --> 00:47:24.284]  Now 62.
[00:47:24.324 --> 00:47:40.435]  Who knows if she's got that long left on this earth.
[00:47:40.756 --> 00:47:41.216]  Just saying.
[00:47:41.236 --> 00:47:43.097]  I don't wish her any harm though, I really don't.
[00:47:43.718 --> 00:47:44.418]  By the way, hit pause.
[00:47:46.059 --> 00:47:47.861]  I'm gonna demarcate this, this point.
[00:47:49.034 --> 00:48:10.612]  I was sitting there this morning reading the news at like 6am, 6.30, in bed, with a little devilish iPad, and I was thinking to myself, if this lady really is collapsing and can't do the debates with Trump, and there's no way she can at this point,
[00:48:11.442 --> 00:48:16.103]  That's why they have to basically have the first debate be this back-to-back, where she goes first, he goes after.
[00:48:16.123 --> 00:48:17.264]  They're not on the same stage.
[00:48:17.584 --> 00:48:19.925]  In case she has to bow out and they have to go to video or something.
[00:48:19.945 --> 00:48:21.145]  I don't know how they're going to pull this off.
[00:48:23.146 --> 00:48:37.730]  One of the ways they could pull the globalist bacon out of the fire, because in the words of the Economist, in the words of the Financial Times, all the big globalist mouthpieces and organs, they're saying, if Hillary falls, the new world order, global government is in desperate trouble.
[00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:39.491]  Washington Post has said the same thing.
[00:48:40.339 --> 00:48:40.539]  I think?
[00:48:58.027 --> 00:48:58.547]  Spidness.
[00:48:59.068 --> 00:49:02.650]  They kill Hillary Clinton, and they blame it on folks like myself.
[00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:07.593]  Because I kept wondering last month how they keep implying that I physically want to hurt Hillary Clinton.
[00:49:08.173 --> 00:49:12.475]  Or they had some graphic about her campaign is blowing away, she's disintegrating.
[00:49:13.076 --> 00:49:16.598]  And they heard me say that's them in a graphic where she's like sand being blown away.
[00:49:16.798 --> 00:49:20.280]  And the news was all, Jones has a graphic of her brains being blown out!
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:22.040]  Let's be clear.
[00:49:22.361 --> 00:49:24.622]  Hillary is a front person, though she's nasty and horrible.
[00:49:24.983 --> 00:49:31.687]  I want to see her stand trial so that other criminals in government back off and stop sending this country towards World War III.
[00:49:33.949 --> 00:49:39.693]  But myself or no one else is associated in this audience with wanting to hurt Hillary Clinton.
[00:49:40.073 --> 00:49:42.295]  And that's on record, and the Secret Service knows that.
[00:49:42.555 --> 00:49:43.595]  So good luck, media.
[00:49:44.236 --> 00:49:46.898]  If you have some mental patient or some wind-up toy or some loon,
[00:49:49.485 --> 00:49:51.947]  Kill her, and then try to blame it on the Liberty Movement.
[00:49:52.007 --> 00:49:53.108]  It's not gonna work.
[00:49:53.348 --> 00:49:56.171]  Oh, the first woman president, she was gonna win.
[00:49:56.211 --> 00:50:08.682]  And by the way, even in their Cook polls, from CNN to the LA Times to Reuters to Bloomberg this week, guess who is up in the polls two to three to four points ahead of Hillary.
[00:50:09.402 --> 00:50:14.507]  Even with Cook polls, Donald Trump is ahead of her.
[00:50:15.714 --> 00:50:17.795]  We went out to the UT football game on Sunday.
[00:50:17.835 --> 00:50:18.956]  Normally, they're on Saturday.
[00:50:18.976 --> 00:50:19.576]  It was on Sunday.
[00:50:19.596 --> 00:50:21.517]  Our crew did.
[00:50:21.997 --> 00:50:24.739]  And we could find almost no one who was for Hillary.
[00:50:24.939 --> 00:50:28.580]  And if they did, I'm going to skip this break, they would say, we hate Hillary.
[00:50:30.201 --> 00:50:31.882]  But, you know, we have to be politically correct.
[00:50:33.283 --> 00:50:35.444]  And I guarantee a lot of these folks are just saying that on camera.
[00:50:35.844 --> 00:50:37.205]  It is so embarrassing.
[00:50:37.665 --> 00:50:40.066]  It is so ridiculous, this peer pressure.
[00:50:40.086 --> 00:50:45.309]  But even in Austin, the supposed big liberal area of Texas, we could find almost no one
[00:50:46.363 --> 00:50:51.767]  Including Hispanics, you name it, that supported Hillary.
[00:50:52.808 --> 00:50:53.928]  I don't see her bumper stickers.
[00:50:54.108 --> 00:50:55.790]  All I see, I saw one today.
[00:50:56.490 --> 00:50:58.111]  It's like, ooh, look at Hillary's sticker, how rare.
[00:50:58.532 --> 00:51:00.553]  I see Hillary for Prison stickers all over the place.
[00:51:01.914 --> 00:51:02.574]  All over the place.
[00:51:04.176 --> 00:51:07.998]  Incidentally, and just plugging, I forgot, we're still selling Hillary for Prison shirts for $9.95.
[00:51:08.418 --> 00:51:11.701]  That includes shipping, so that's at cost.
[00:51:11.721 --> 00:51:12.421]  $9.95, shipping included.
[00:51:12.481 --> 00:51:13.082]  No more shipping.
[00:51:13.865 --> 00:51:16.126]  We're limited time, though, because we are selling out of them very, very quickly.
[00:51:17.466 --> 00:51:21.327]  And you get a couple free Hillary for Prison stickers with each order and a pocket Constitution.
[00:51:21.667 --> 00:51:23.808]  So I just realized I'm losing money on that, probably.
[00:51:24.348 --> 00:51:27.849]  Yeah, like a 50-cent pocket Constitution, a couple bumper stickers that are 8 cents apiece.
[00:51:27.869 --> 00:51:30.910]  Yeah, that's like almost 70 cents on top of that.
[00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:31.850]  I guess we're losing money.
[00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:33.211]  This is a lost leader.
[00:51:33.231 --> 00:51:35.411]  Hillary for Prison, I just want to get them out there everywhere.
[00:51:36.832 --> 00:51:37.692]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:51:39.366 --> 00:51:42.287]  Or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:51:42.327 --> 00:51:43.727]  This is a revolution.
[00:51:44.287 --> 00:51:45.347]  This is an info war.
[00:51:45.387 --> 00:51:46.607]  This is about visibility.
[00:51:47.168 --> 00:51:51.208]  If you've got the funds, I would get them for everybody in your office, everybody you know, people in your church.
[00:51:51.488 --> 00:51:52.789]  It's time to get aggressive, folks.
[00:51:53.409 --> 00:51:56.209]  You're not going to find a shirt with shipping included lower than this.
[00:51:56.509 --> 00:51:57.230]  Hillary for prison.
[00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:00.530]  We've got some other t-shirts as well, like Molon Labe.
[00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:01.790]  They're all excellent.
[00:52:01.811 --> 00:52:02.671]  Okay, I'm going to stop plugging.
[00:52:03.631 --> 00:52:08.732]  Let's go back to Hillary and her coughing fit, where she just has to pause for long periods of time.
[00:52:08.772 --> 00:52:09.012]  Here it is.
[00:52:14.199 --> 00:52:17.641]  Well... Emblematic of collapse.
[00:52:18.402 --> 00:52:26.128]  Otherwise you hear her... Not doing well.
[00:52:26.308 --> 00:52:27.389]  Something's going on there, folks.
[00:52:30.091 --> 00:52:32.253]  They were so dumb, they're just gonna put her up there on TV.
[00:52:32.273 --> 00:52:35.135]  62 days and they tell her everything's okay.
[00:52:35.913 --> 00:52:38.634]  Well, you just heard the next vice president, didn't you?
[00:52:39.295 --> 00:52:42.796]  He's not the vice president yet.
[00:52:44.657 --> 00:52:47.619]  In addition to thanking Marsha Fudge.
[00:52:49.099 --> 00:52:52.801]  So thank your great Senator Sherrod Brown.
[00:52:53.722 --> 00:52:54.222]  Pause for a minute.
[00:52:55.384 --> 00:52:56.864]  We're not editing the video, that's just a glitch.
[00:52:57.424 --> 00:53:05.086]  Now, understand folks, they think you're stupid, and they can just get this across the finish line, and then who knows what can happen then.
[00:53:05.106 --> 00:53:19.088]  Well, I'll tell you, Cain, who's behind her, who's just as nasty as she is, and just as owned by the globalists, is just sitting there, hoping the corpse, Weekend with Hillary, can get across that finish line.
[00:53:19.128 --> 00:53:22.709]  They are in a race with the devil, and I'm telling you, they're losing.
[00:53:23.905 --> 00:53:24.345]  Look at her.
[00:53:24.766 --> 00:53:26.867]  And she's honking, she's sucking air.
[00:53:27.588 --> 00:53:28.828]  She looks like she's about to collapse.
[00:53:28.868 --> 00:53:29.869]  She can barely stand up.
[00:53:29.889 --> 00:53:30.770]  She looks like she's dizzy.
[00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:32.051]  She's stumbling around.
[00:53:33.592 --> 00:53:40.016]  And whenever people sit there and say something to her in the crowd, she looks like she's about to go crazy.
[00:53:40.276 --> 00:53:44.179]  And a doctor with an injector pen runs up next to her.
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:50.283]  The Conservative Review gives Senator Tim Kaine an F or a zero score for Liberty.
[00:53:51.124 --> 00:53:52.745]  But it's okay, because you're going to vote for
[00:53:53.749 --> 00:54:02.994]  The guy that wants open borders and bans on all rifles above five rounds in the magazine and who supports the TPP, Gary, I love Hillary Johnson.
[00:54:03.715 --> 00:54:06.857]  Let's go ahead and go back to the coughing fits of Hitlery.
[00:54:11.019 --> 00:54:15.222]  Excuse me.
[00:54:15.502 --> 00:54:17.063]  Just hand it or something else, another drug.
[00:54:17.083 --> 00:54:20.685]  Also, two other great
[00:54:21.314 --> 00:54:24.916]  Members of Congress, Tim Ryan and Joyce Beatty.
[00:54:25.857 --> 00:54:28.778]  Oh, she is struggling with every bit of her hateful will to hold those coughs back.
[00:54:30.379 --> 00:54:30.879]  She can't help it.
[00:54:30.899 --> 00:54:33.861]  And your mayor, thanks to Mayor Jackson.
[00:54:34.181 --> 00:54:38.143]  Guarantee you she's on drugs to keep her larynx calm.
[00:54:39.744 --> 00:54:41.325]  Guarantee you those lozenges are opiate-based.
[00:54:41.385 --> 00:54:46.788]  And I hope that Ohio will send Ted Strickland to the Senate.
[00:54:52.225 --> 00:54:58.548]  Now, behind me are some of the great labor leaders of our country.
[00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:07.332]  Randy Weingarten, Lee Saunders, and Mitch Trumka.
[00:55:10.454 --> 00:55:17.297]  I'm proud to be on the same stage with them, because they're always fighting for working families.
[00:55:20.999 --> 00:55:21.219]  Now,
[00:55:22.972 --> 00:55:37.245]  As I get over my allergic reaction, let me say that we're here in part because we know how important this election is to Ohio.
[00:55:38.447 --> 00:55:39.447]  Listen, I can't put up with this.
[00:55:39.467 --> 00:55:39.868]  That's enough.
[00:55:39.988 --> 00:55:40.348]  That's enough.
[00:55:40.368 --> 00:55:40.649]  Stop.
[00:55:41.189 --> 00:55:42.630]  It's not just that's enough.
[00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:43.852]  It goes on for a lot longer.
[00:55:44.716 --> 00:55:47.958]  Now, let's go to her in her so-called press conference, if you're a radio listener.
[00:55:48.419 --> 00:55:57.104]  There's like eight sycophantic women looking at her like she is Jesus returned to earth.
[00:55:57.124 --> 00:56:03.569]  I mean, they're looking at her like fawning communist slaves looking at Kim Jong-un in North Korea.
[00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:08.572]  And then she basically has a coughing fit and has to stop that press conference.
[00:56:08.632 --> 00:56:14.216]  And then she doubles down again and pops up about a conspiracy theory about her health and starts
[00:56:15.253 --> 00:56:16.755]  To begin coughing and has to stop that.
[00:56:17.216 --> 00:56:20.841]  So, God is basically taking the power of speech away from this woman.
[00:56:23.104 --> 00:56:24.666]  But, oh she's not sick, there's no problem.
[00:56:25.327 --> 00:56:27.851]  Let's go ahead and go to her on the aircraft.
[00:56:32.799 --> 00:56:39.024]  I mean, to pull out of NATO, for goodness sakes, right?
[00:56:40.305 --> 00:56:44.148]  And he furthermore has praised Putin.
[00:56:44.168 --> 00:56:50.513]  He seems to have this bizarre attraction to dictators, including Putin.
[00:56:50.533 --> 00:56:53.296]  He won't tell us where he owes $650 million.
[00:56:53.316 --> 00:56:56.818]  There's a lot of rumors about that.
[00:57:02.221 --> 00:57:11.425]  You know, made it clear that he doesn't particularly care whether Putin and the intelligence services attack American institutions.
[00:57:11.445 --> 00:57:14.606]  So, let's get some water.
[00:57:14.666 --> 00:57:15.987]  Okay, it gets worse when she has to stop.
[00:57:17.861 --> 00:57:18.181]  That's enough.
[00:57:18.201 --> 00:57:20.042]  The full video is up on Infowars.com.
[00:57:20.163 --> 00:57:22.504]  And this is a whole other area I didn't even get into today.
[00:57:23.305 --> 00:57:30.850]  The White House over the weekend, Obama, came out and officially said that he's going to take over the elections to protect us from the Russians.
[00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:35.713]  So don't worry about Obama and the globalists and the communist Chinese, who basically run our government.
[00:57:36.033 --> 00:57:42.798]  The Russians that have the GDP of Italy, they now are running Trump, yours truly, everybody.
[00:57:42.918 --> 00:57:45.900]  She said that in her speech a few weeks ago on the alt-right, remember?
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.161]  Well now,
[00:57:48.421 --> 00:57:50.722]  I guess Putin's causing those coughing fits as well.
[00:57:52.702 --> 00:58:01.444]  Now they're going to have to bring in federal and international watchers and control everything with Jeb Johnson because of the Russians.
[00:58:02.545 --> 00:58:11.747]  And then she went further, and she had to cancel this little speech so later, I guess she had enough medication, she scurried back out for this quick clip as we go to break, where she talked about the conspiracy theorist.
[00:58:12.207 --> 00:58:12.547]  Here's that.
[00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:19.051]  Are you concerned about conspiracy theories about your health and whether that will affect the election?
[00:58:19.111 --> 00:58:22.292]  And are you concerned separately about the tightening polls for Donald Trump?
[00:58:22.933 --> 00:58:25.914]  I'm not concerned about the conspiracy theories.
[00:58:26.514 --> 00:58:28.554]  There are so many of them, I've lost track of them.
[00:58:29.255 --> 00:58:30.955]  And so I pay no attention to them.
[00:58:31.235 --> 00:58:33.256]  I've always thought this was going to be a close race.
[00:58:33.296 --> 00:58:43.199]  That's the history of modern... So questioning a known liar who spent a year in a hospital... Again, she has a magic word, conspiracy theory.
[00:58:45.683 --> 00:58:46.204]  We'll be back.
[00:58:46.264 --> 00:58:46.644]  Stay with us.
[00:58:46.684 --> 00:58:47.064]  Second hour.
[00:58:47.084 --> 00:58:48.466]  Here's Hillary's new song.
[00:58:49.046 --> 00:58:59.477]  Soon they'll say it's a conspiracy theory if you don't call that her new language she's invented.
[00:59:00.158 --> 00:59:03.701]  Joe Vigs here with Infowars.com with an update on unhealthy Hillary.
[00:59:03.921 --> 00:59:07.685]  Hillary Clinton says conspiracy theories about her health not a concern.
[00:59:08.005 --> 00:59:08.446]  Sorry.
[00:59:08.666 --> 00:59:10.948]  But it is not a conspiracy.
[00:59:11.088 --> 00:59:12.228]  You are sick.
[00:59:12.449 --> 00:59:13.669]  You can barely stand up.
[00:59:13.729 --> 00:59:17.852]  You have to get injections by some giant ogre-looking dude to keep going.
[00:59:18.052 --> 00:59:19.553]  You cough uncontrollably.
[00:59:19.733 --> 00:59:23.916]  You can barely even speak in or stand for long periods of time.
[00:59:24.116 --> 00:59:26.598]  You very rarely speak for over 15 minutes.
[00:59:26.638 --> 00:59:27.899]  This is not a conspiracy.
[00:59:27.979 --> 00:59:29.040]  There's something going on.
[00:59:38.626 --> 00:59:40.887]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:12.796 --> 01:00:15.819]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:20.544]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:39.651 --> 01:00:44.677]  So, just to finish up, if you joined us, Hillary Clinton had three different coughing fits yesterday.
[01:00:45.358 --> 01:00:56.651]  She had to basically cancel a speech early, cancel one of her first press conferences in almost a year, with a bunch of sycophants on board treason aircraft, or which one?
[01:00:57.712 --> 01:00:58.893]  I don't know.
[01:01:23.832 --> 01:01:29.922]  Zach just popped in my ear during the break, and we'll put it on screen, and said, you know, this is a sign of congenital heart failure.
[01:01:30.824 --> 01:01:31.905]  And everybody knows that.
[01:01:32.246 --> 01:01:33.809]  He's had family that's had heart problems.
[01:01:35.071 --> 01:01:43.398]  Or you've seen the movie The Godfather, you know, where the Godfather starts having a heart attack, he first starts coughing, you know, in the back of the garden with the grandson.
[01:01:43.819 --> 01:01:49.584]  I mean, everybody's always known that many heart attacks are associated, and heart problems are associated, with coughing fits.
[01:01:49.664 --> 01:01:57.971]  And the old-timers would take nitroglycerin to get their heart jumping again, and they would, you know, start coughing, and so pop one of those.
[01:01:58.692 --> 01:02:04.161]  So we'll put that article that you were just talking about on screen, Zach, and we can show people what we were just talking about.
[01:02:05.363 --> 01:02:06.345]  Or it's stuff on Grudge.
[01:02:06.385 --> 01:02:07.046]  I guess I can go there.
[01:02:10.106 --> 01:02:14.708]  Everyday Health, and you scroll down, how too much thyroid hormone affects your heart.
[01:02:15.468 --> 01:02:22.251]  An overactive thyroid gland, hyperthyroidism, can cause the irregular heartbeat or atrial fibrillation.
[01:02:22.331 --> 01:02:30.974]  The thyroid, which is a small gland in your neck, could throw your heart out of its natural rhythm and increase your risk of heart failure or stroke.
[01:02:31.554 --> 01:02:38.397]  That is because thyroid hormone has a profound effect on the heart's function and may cause
[01:02:40.057 --> 01:02:41.017]  Atrial fibrillation.
[01:02:41.277 --> 01:02:42.297]  But that doesn't matter.
[01:02:42.317 --> 01:02:48.458]  It doesn't matter that 2.7 million Americans suffer from it, according to the National Heart Association.
[01:02:48.478 --> 01:02:56.960]  It doesn't matter that Hillary's got all these medical problems and cardiovascular problems and is on drugs for hyperthyroidism.
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:01.981]  When medical doctors bring it up on CNN, they get fired a few days later.
[01:03:02.341 --> 01:03:05.361]  And then I get attacked on the national news as having a dark heart.
[01:03:06.362 --> 01:03:08.662]  And then I'm some big, evil deceiver.
[01:03:09.932 --> 01:03:14.516]  Very well reports the surprising way Hillary Clinton treats her thyroid condition.
[01:03:14.776 --> 01:03:16.697]  And that's what Dr. Drew said.
[01:03:17.678 --> 01:03:23.523]  He said taking armor thyroid from the 40s and 50s that hasn't been subscribed since the 60s is unheard of.
[01:03:23.603 --> 01:03:27.886]  And he said taking it with Coumadin, which is rat poison, is insane.
[01:03:29.127 --> 01:03:32.470]  And that the two counteract each other with devastating effects.
[01:03:34.517 --> 01:03:35.257]  The plot thickens.
[01:03:35.298 --> 01:03:37.719]  The truth is, I've talked to medical doctors about this.
[01:03:37.839 --> 01:03:38.940]  We've got one coming on later.
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:43.843]  No one really knows what condition you take these things with.
[01:03:44.804 --> 01:03:49.387]  But see, you don't question that, though, because Hillary said so.
[01:03:50.916 --> 01:03:58.078]  Hyperthyroidism, which she admittedly has, is an overactive thyroid, which is caused in many Americans by fluoride in the water.
[01:03:58.098 --> 01:03:58.498]  That's admitted.
[01:03:58.878 --> 01:04:05.600]  Sentence can include a slow metabolic system, fatigue, weight gain, and other issues.
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:12.682]  And Hillary Clinton fits the bill of what she admittedly has that then gives you heart problems.
[01:04:14.583 --> 01:04:19.264]  And when you start having that happen with your heart, it's connected to everything else, and you start coughing.
[01:04:20.069 --> 01:04:21.390]  You start hacking.
[01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:23.911]  You start having problems.
[01:04:24.971 --> 01:04:34.075]  But, I'm sorry, we're not allowed to talk about that because Hillary and the national press controls reality and they said that's just the way it is.
[01:04:34.135 --> 01:04:35.815]  Well, the truth is, it's not just the way it is.
[01:04:36.155 --> 01:04:37.696]  And reality is catching up.
[01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:40.697]  Hillary Clinton is crashing and burning.
[01:04:43.618 --> 01:04:44.579]  It's very poignant.
[01:04:45.559 --> 01:04:47.160]  It's very apropos.
[01:04:49.556 --> 01:05:07.615]  It's a symbol of the rotting, corrupt, arrogant system that would even try to run someone like this, and then even as she collapses close to the finish line after stealing the nomination from Bernie Sanders, she still arrogantly crawls forward like a giant squirm.
[01:05:09.477 --> 01:05:10.898]  Folks, the message is clear.
[01:05:11.278 --> 01:05:12.499]  The parallels are there.
[01:05:12.779 --> 01:05:28.310]  There are millions of ordinary Americans who've been let down, who've had a bad time, who feel the political class in Washington are detached from them, who feel so many of their representatives are politically correct parts of that liberal media elite.
[01:05:28.690 --> 01:05:35.836]  They feel people aren't standing up for them, and they've actually, in many cases, given up on the whole electoral process.
[01:05:35.876 --> 01:05:41.721]  And I think, I think that you have a fantastic opportunity here with this campaign.
[01:05:42.201 --> 01:05:43.002]  You can go out.
[01:05:43.482 --> 01:05:44.883]  You can beat the pollsters.
[01:05:45.484 --> 01:05:47.666]  You can beat the commentators.
[01:05:47.686 --> 01:05:49.387]  You can beat Washington.
[01:05:49.407 --> 01:05:53.891]  Mr. Farage, who just recently resigned as the head of UKIP, still in the EU Parliament.
[01:05:54.431 --> 01:05:56.853]  Wow, talk about a David versus Goliath story.
[01:05:57.193 --> 01:05:57.854]  This is epic.
[01:05:58.474 --> 01:06:25.641]  What it is, and I think the point about Brexit, Alex, is Brexit is the first victory against this phenomenon of the big banks, the big businesses, effectively owning politics, literally willfully destroying nation-state democracy, getting rid of that thing that our forebears actually fought and shed their blood to create and to preserve, our liberties, our freedoms, all of that being taken away and suddenly
[01:06:26.281 --> 01:06:30.822]  Suddenly, in a referendum that no one said we could win.
[01:06:30.902 --> 01:06:35.943]  I mean literally nobody thought Brexit would succeed and we've done it.
[01:06:35.963 --> 01:06:43.205]  Hillary represents everything that has gone wrong in our lives in the last couple of decades.
[01:06:43.765 --> 01:06:46.586]  She is part, you know, of that class of people.
[01:06:47.339 --> 01:06:56.707]  Who have taken us into an endless series of foreign wars, that I think arguably have made things worse, certainly in Libya and elsewhere, not better.
[01:06:57.548 --> 01:06:59.129]  She is part of that phenomenon.
[01:06:59.824 --> 01:07:03.665]  Where all that seems to matter now is corporatism.
[01:07:04.046 --> 01:07:11.848]  You know, the big global companies who want to set the rule books to effectively put out of business small and medium-sized competitors.
[01:07:12.349 --> 01:07:21.492]  They have destroyed, you know, what I believe to be proper free market capitalism, where your eye can go and set up a company, you know, and have a real chance of succeeding.
[01:07:22.052 --> 01:07:31.100]  And they've presided over a period where the rich have got richer, and where ordinary, decent, working people have seen their living standards deteriorate.
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:33.201]  She represents failure.
[01:07:33.421 --> 01:07:40.747]  And she, of course, is completely unreconciled to the vote on Brexit, because Hillary loves the European Union.
[01:07:41.108 --> 01:07:47.133]  I think she sees the European Union as a prototype for an even bigger form of world government.
[01:07:47.273 --> 01:07:48.434]  But let me make it clear.
[01:07:49.234 --> 01:08:03.538]  If you want nothing to change at all, if you want to continue with the kind of cronyism that we see with the Clinton Foundation and everything else, if you want things to stay the same, you vote for Hillary.
[01:08:03.958 --> 01:08:08.119]  I wouldn't vote for Hillary if she paid me, and I feel pretty strongly about that.
[01:08:20.109 --> 01:08:24.231]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:08:24.951 --> 01:08:26.251]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:54.910]  Paul Joseph Watson has a powerful video report up on InfoWars.com.
[01:08:54.970 --> 01:08:55.710]  It just went live.
[01:08:56.290 --> 01:08:57.890]  Gary Johnson is an idiot.
[01:09:00.411 --> 01:09:03.692]  And Paul knows how to, you know, do the headlines that get 5 million views.
[01:09:04.232 --> 01:09:20.275]  The truth is, Gary Johnson is a complete and total globalist operative, meant to steal votes away from Donald J. Trump and deliver this country's final blow in its descent into absolute squalor and globalist management.
[01:09:21.644 --> 01:09:25.605]  I'm going to air that report coming up after Mr. Nichols leaves us.
[01:09:26.185 --> 01:09:27.625]  Larry was going to come on a few weeks ago.
[01:09:27.665 --> 01:09:28.746]  He's been extremely ill.
[01:09:28.766 --> 01:09:29.546]  He's going to leave it at that.
[01:09:29.626 --> 01:09:30.406]  Battling cancer.
[01:09:30.826 --> 01:09:31.606]  That's no secret.
[01:09:33.607 --> 01:09:35.907]  If you're a radio listener, you hear Mr. Nichols.
[01:09:36.227 --> 01:09:38.948]  As a TV viewer, you can also watch the broadcast.
[01:09:39.308 --> 01:09:43.309]  Infowars.com forward slash show to find all the free video and audio feeds and more.
[01:09:44.716 --> 01:09:48.138]  And Nichols was in Black Ops, Secret of Operations.
[01:09:49.239 --> 01:09:56.244]  He was basically assigned to the Clintons when they ran for the governorship as two CIA operatives.
[01:09:58.385 --> 01:09:59.966]  This has all been partially declassified.
[01:09:59.986 --> 01:10:01.267]  It's the only reason I can talk about it.
[01:10:02.148 --> 01:10:04.309]  Our people releasing the information would be killed.
[01:10:05.170 --> 01:10:10.553]  But they were, even though the name of their handler in London, when they were first on that desk, they were also sent into Russia.
[01:10:11.991 --> 01:10:19.614]  Without getting into a long story short here, I've interviewed the CIA flight commanders that were running the operations at MENA, Terry Reid.
[01:10:19.634 --> 01:10:21.775]  I've interviewed the people that were in-country.
[01:10:22.175 --> 01:10:24.336]  I've interviewed the people that worked for them.
[01:10:24.396 --> 01:10:25.537]  I've interviewed basically everybody.
[01:10:26.117 --> 01:10:29.378]  And one of the key folks that helped all these dominoes come down is Larry Nichols.
[01:10:31.059 --> 01:10:35.401]  Now, Larry said a year and a half ago, Hillary will not be indicted for the emails.
[01:10:35.901 --> 01:10:36.341]  And she wasn't.
[01:10:37.901 --> 01:10:40.323]  He said that she's going to play this health stuff up.
[01:10:40.343 --> 01:10:43.386]  He said that a year ago, and that it's to make her look like an underdog.
[01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:48.590]  Now, I want to say that I respect Larry, and he's been proven right nine times out of ten.
[01:10:48.991 --> 01:10:49.992]  But she looks like hell.
[01:10:50.312 --> 01:10:57.678]  I mean, even the best costume design, even the best Hollywood makeup folks, it's hard to make you look this sick when you really are this sick.
[01:10:58.799 --> 01:11:00.701]  Is she really sick, or are they playing up to it?
[01:11:01.622 --> 01:11:02.442]  Why would she be having
[01:11:03.487 --> 01:11:05.569]  Speeches where she hacks and coughs and can't even talk.
[01:11:05.629 --> 01:11:09.492]  I mean, if this is a strategy, I want them to continue it because it's hurting her, in my view.
[01:11:09.552 --> 01:11:15.237]  Trump is, even in polls that are twisted, where they're adding 10-15% more Democrats, is beating her.
[01:11:16.017 --> 01:11:17.499]  I see that in the street all over the country.
[01:11:17.539 --> 01:11:19.640]  We go to Democrat areas and we can't find people.
[01:11:20.661 --> 01:11:21.342]  It's very hard.
[01:11:21.382 --> 01:11:25.946]  I mean, 9 out of 10, 8 out of 10, depending on where we're at, Democrats say they don't like Hillary.
[01:11:25.966 --> 01:11:29.789]  In fact, a lot of them hate her more than they hate Trump.
[01:11:32.022 --> 01:11:34.203]  Like a lot of Democrats are going, wait, I used to like him.
[01:11:34.684 --> 01:11:39.046]  Wait a minute, didn't he, you know, for equal rights and all this stuff?
[01:11:40.327 --> 01:11:48.552]  So I don't want to sit here and go with his gospel, what Larry's saying, but I also don't just have people on I agree with, and I want to be clear.
[01:11:49.833 --> 01:11:51.574]  We try to have people on we disagree with all the time.
[01:11:51.634 --> 01:11:52.855]  They're usually cowards and won't do it.
[01:11:52.875 --> 01:11:56.157]  They even offer bounties to people and they're scared to do it.
[01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:59.861]  I'm not saying I disagree with Nichols, though.
[01:11:59.881 --> 01:12:01.583]  We're having an open, free-form debate.
[01:12:02.023 --> 01:12:05.966]  So many listeners comment on InfoWars, they go, what is this?
[01:12:06.186 --> 01:12:10.530]  One day you got somebody on saying this, and the next day you got somebody on saying that.
[01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:20.718]  That's the whole point, is that I'll have on, you know, somebody like Dent
[01:12:22.008 --> 01:12:23.749]  Who disagrees with somebody like Schiff.
[01:12:23.809 --> 01:12:27.751]  But overall, their predictions are 90 plus percent accurate.
[01:12:28.332 --> 01:12:29.592]  Now we're getting down to the endgame.
[01:12:29.612 --> 01:12:31.173]  We're going to see whether it's inflation.
[01:12:34.495 --> 01:12:36.897]  Like one of them has been saying, or not.
[01:12:37.637 --> 01:12:39.078]  And we've got that economic news today.
[01:12:39.118 --> 01:12:43.601]  And I'll tell you something else that Larry Nichols said, and I'm not talking about this to talk about Larry Nichols.
[01:12:43.921 --> 01:12:45.562]  It all feeds into what's currently happening.
[01:12:48.163 --> 01:12:51.145]  Russia and Saudi Arabia are discussing oil production freeze.
[01:12:51.525 --> 01:12:53.567]  Russian Energy Minister said that over the weekend.
[01:12:53.847 --> 01:12:59.371]  And then today, boom, oil prices jump after Russia and Saudi Arabia create Market Stability Task Force.
[01:13:00.652 --> 01:13:04.555]  Treasuries climb, dollar falls as traders trim Fed hike wagers.
[01:13:05.095 --> 01:13:06.296]  That's Financial Times of London.
[01:13:08.248 --> 01:13:12.090]  It was about, I don't know, four months ago, Larry said, get ready and watch the German banks.
[01:13:12.150 --> 01:13:14.132]  It could be a month from now, it could be six months from now.
[01:13:14.732 --> 01:13:20.535]  Well, then they started coming out in the last month and saying the German banks could completely go under, many times bigger than Lehman Brothers.
[01:13:21.236 --> 01:13:29.721]  Two weeks ago, a week and a half ago to be technical, they told German citizens in major newspapers, they said, get prepared for a total emergency.
[01:13:29.761 --> 01:13:30.561]  They won't say what.
[01:13:31.382 --> 01:13:34.003]  So a lot of craziness is going on right now.
[01:13:34.443 --> 01:13:36.825]  Obama was received for the first time ever.
[01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:44.203]  As a major head of state going to another major nation, at the back of the plane, the Chinese told him, you come off here.
[01:13:44.223 --> 01:13:48.585]  His minion got off and said, what are you doing to us?
[01:13:48.625 --> 01:13:50.166]  And they said, this is our airport, our country.
[01:13:51.566 --> 01:13:53.868]  The Chinese official getting in her face.
[01:13:55.888 --> 01:13:56.669]  No red carpet.
[01:13:59.410 --> 01:14:01.771]  So what on earth is going on here?
[01:14:01.811 --> 01:14:07.294]  These are all symbols to the world of what China thinks of the US and it's public.
[01:14:08.703 --> 01:14:21.275]  The United States, run by globalists, made deals to give them the rarest minerals, worldwide production rights, deep water ports, the Panama Canal, but the Chinese were not to militarily get out of their sphere.
[01:14:21.895 --> 01:14:30.103]  Not as far as Japan, to the north and to the east, not as far south as the Philippines.
[01:14:30.403 --> 01:14:31.745]  The Chinese have broke that deal.
[01:14:34.090 --> 01:14:38.694]  They've broken their deal, just like Hitler and Stalin breaking deals with each other.
[01:14:38.814 --> 01:14:40.375]  And now all hell's breaking loose.
[01:14:40.996 --> 01:14:42.117]  Joining us is Larry Nichols.
[01:14:42.157 --> 01:14:43.618]  Larry, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:14:43.918 --> 01:14:45.159]  We appreciate you, my friend.
[01:14:45.179 --> 01:14:46.260]  I know you're only on the phone today.
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:47.121]  I hope you're doing well.
[01:14:47.961 --> 01:14:52.685]  Folks can find you at facebook.com forward slash Larry dot Nichols dot 921.
[01:14:53.046 --> 01:14:54.067]  We'll also give out your
[01:14:55.319 --> 01:14:58.741]  Your other address is here before you leave us, but you heard me just lay the table there.
[01:14:59.081 --> 01:15:01.083]  Tell us where you want to start first.
[01:15:01.763 --> 01:15:02.924]  Oh my God, Alex.
[01:15:03.084 --> 01:15:06.106]  Number one, let me get it right out in the open, folks.
[01:15:06.206 --> 01:15:07.326]  I'm no clairvoyant.
[01:15:07.627 --> 01:15:08.547]  I'm no prophet.
[01:15:09.748 --> 01:15:10.268]  None of that.
[01:15:11.949 --> 01:15:15.231]  Alex, going first, where you were talking about Hillary's health issue.
[01:15:15.371 --> 01:15:16.572]  Remember what I've said.
[01:15:16.592 --> 01:15:21.235]  I haven't been with those people in, what, 20, 30 years.
[01:15:21.975 --> 01:15:23.176]  I'm not in on the meetings.
[01:15:23.296 --> 01:15:24.237]  What I do know
[01:15:25.419 --> 01:15:27.019]  It's what they're trained to do.
[01:15:27.239 --> 01:15:32.101]  So if she sees an opening with this medical issue, she's going to use it.
[01:15:33.021 --> 01:15:34.401]  Now, is she really sick?
[01:15:34.461 --> 01:15:35.442]  I'm like you, Alex.
[01:15:35.542 --> 01:15:36.382]  Is she really sick?
[01:15:36.402 --> 01:15:41.263]  It's kind of looking like the lady's got some, or the animal, I'm not going to say, lady's got a problem.
[01:15:42.123 --> 01:15:44.484]  She will milk it for everything she can.
[01:15:44.504 --> 01:15:49.205]  But you said something else, Alex, that's incredibly important.
[01:15:50.025 --> 01:15:52.186]  You said that as y'all have gone around,
[01:15:53.701 --> 01:15:58.822]  In the black communities, etc., throughout the country, you haven't done any of that, and it's all for Hillary.
[01:15:59.302 --> 01:16:00.263]  Let me tell you something.
[01:16:00.303 --> 01:16:02.663]  For years and years, you know this has happened.
[01:16:02.703 --> 01:16:10.965]  In Arkansas, for years, you could go around the state, and after an election, nobody voted for Bill Clinton.
[01:16:11.465 --> 01:16:12.785]  However, he won.
[01:16:12.805 --> 01:16:14.806]  How do you do that?
[01:16:15.866 --> 01:16:18.947]  Well, that's what we're going to... Well, he just turned the next vice president.
[01:16:20.086 --> 01:16:21.827]  Keep going, we're playing some Hillary in the background.
[01:16:21.867 --> 01:16:22.408]  Go ahead.
[01:16:23.568 --> 01:16:31.593]  Well, the biggest thing that we have to face today is organized mass multiple voting.
[01:16:32.354 --> 01:16:41.420]  And that's why Alex, all over the country, you're seeing this voter ID, states have passed voter ID laws.
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:45.362]  And now they've got the Justice Department in there saying they're going to sue.
[01:16:45.382 --> 01:16:46.863]  In fact, thank God you just reminded me.
[01:16:46.883 --> 01:16:48.364]  That's why I wanted to get you on last week.
[01:16:48.844 --> 01:16:50.205]  And you were only able to come on this week, Larry.
[01:16:50.846 --> 01:16:53.467]  Obama says a month ago there's no such thing as election fraud.
[01:16:53.787 --> 01:17:05.154]  Now he announces massive fraud by the Republicans, quote, run by Putin, incredible conspiracy theory, so they're going to federalize everything and hook federal computers up to all the machines to save us.
[01:17:05.435 --> 01:17:07.336]  How insanely obvious is this, Larry?
[01:17:08.157 --> 01:17:12.261]  Oh man, well, you know, here again, guys, this is the big one.
[01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:20.128]  I hope people understand, Alex, we're playing a game today, and I hate to call it a game, but we're in a fight for our lives as a nation.
[01:17:20.388 --> 01:17:21.249]  We're in a fight for it.
[01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:34.581]  It's amazing to me that you've got states that go through their constitutional requirements and put something on the ballot, the state legislature ratifies it, the governor signs it, and then they have a law.
[01:17:35.839 --> 01:17:44.401]  And then the first thing that happens with this law, rightfully and duly passed by the state, a federal judge says, no, you can't do it.
[01:17:46.022 --> 01:17:46.502]  Unbelievable.
[01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:47.962]  And it happens every day.
[01:17:48.142 --> 01:17:54.604]  You know, in North Carolina, as an example, we're trying to work to get people to help that governor in North Carolina.
[01:17:55.407 --> 01:17:59.791]  You've got to have a picture ID to get alcohol.
[01:18:00.132 --> 01:18:01.693]  You've got to have a picture ID to get cigarettes.
[01:18:01.713 --> 01:18:02.454]  Sure, absolutely.
[01:18:02.474 --> 01:18:04.436]  So they want to have dead people vote, other people vote.
[01:18:05.537 --> 01:18:10.081]  They have a list of old voter rolls of people who have stolen the voter rolls but who haven't voted in a while.
[01:18:10.101 --> 01:18:11.343]  There's going to be massive fraud.
[01:18:12.083 --> 01:18:13.705]  Now do you know why that's so important?
[01:18:13.725 --> 01:18:18.069]  When I was with Bill Clinton, now folks this is a long time ago but it's going to happen today.
[01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:22.313]  We used to go to Ward School Bus here in Conway and we used to get school buses.
[01:18:22.393 --> 01:18:33.384]  During the summer we'd get school buses and we would load them up and we'd go to Northeast Arkansas and we'd pick up in that impoverished area of the state, we would pick up black
[01:18:34.088 --> 01:18:39.113]  We would take them to the precincts in Little Rock, kind of what you'd call the ghetto precincts.
[01:18:39.834 --> 01:18:48.123]  We would get them a t-shirt, they'd go in with this card and it would say, hello, I'm Larry Nichols, and then it showed them exactly who to vote for.
[01:18:48.163 --> 01:18:50.645]  They go in, they vote, they come back out, Alex.
[01:18:51.621 --> 01:18:55.002]  We changed their t-shirt, now they got a blue t-shirt on.
[01:18:55.082 --> 01:18:59.343]  They go back in, except this time, instead of Larry Nichols, he's Alex Jones.
[01:19:00.024 --> 01:19:01.584]  He knows how to vote, he fills it out.
[01:19:01.624 --> 01:19:06.605]  He comes back home, gets on the bus, changes t-shirts, goes back in, votes again.
[01:19:06.625 --> 01:19:14.508]  And that's why we've got to be looking for the buses, and we've got to dress up like bums as well, and stumble onto them, and blow their operations.
[01:19:15.308 --> 01:19:16.749]  Now, there you go.
[01:19:16.769 --> 01:19:22.271]  Now, the problem is, folks, all these people say, well, I'll be a poll watcher.
[01:19:22.311 --> 01:19:24.372]  Well, let me tell you where the problem is, guys.
[01:19:24.972 --> 01:19:28.293]  Let me tell you where the massive voter fraud is going to be.
[01:19:28.654 --> 01:19:30.234]  It's going to be in Cleveland.
[01:19:30.254 --> 01:19:31.215]  It's going to be in Detroit.
[01:19:31.235 --> 01:19:32.315]  It's going to be in New York.
[01:19:32.395 --> 01:19:38.918]  It's going to be wherever there are, what do you call them, ghetto communities, large numbers.
[01:19:40.077 --> 01:19:41.318]  That's where you gotta go.
[01:19:41.338 --> 01:19:42.979]  Alright, stay right there Larry Nichols.
[01:19:43.179 --> 01:19:44.159]  Larry, we gotta go to break.
[01:19:44.179 --> 01:19:48.902]  We're gonna come back and talk about this, but if you just joined us, I tell family this and they don't believe it.
[01:19:49.282 --> 01:19:57.446]  It's been announced that Homeland Security is taking over the elections to quote stop Vladimir Putin, but at least we have Hillary in her own press conference saying it.
[01:19:57.906 --> 01:20:01.528]  I'm gonna cue that up on her airplane, or her fake press conference in admitting it.
[01:20:01.828 --> 01:20:03.709]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[01:20:04.369 --> 01:20:07.011]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:14.986 --> 01:20:17.767]  InfoWars is changing the world for the better.
[01:20:18.387 --> 01:20:20.747]  And that means you're changing the world for the better.
[01:20:21.287 --> 01:20:25.068]  When listeners call in and thank me for what I've done, I tell them, are you kidding?
[01:20:25.528 --> 01:20:39.451]  You're the reason we're on the map, spreading the word about the broadcast, telling your friends and family about the show, praying for us, buying the books, the videos, the Hillary for Prison shirts that have become one of the major memes of this election.
[01:20:40.251 --> 01:20:44.374]  This election is a referendum on the crimes of George Soros and his puppet Hillary Clinton.
[01:20:44.955 --> 01:20:52.021]  They've already been shaken to their very core by the fact that over 100,000 of these t-shirts are now on the streets across the United States.
[01:20:52.501 --> 01:20:53.682]  Let's double that number.
[01:20:54.283 --> 01:20:56.524]  Let's put bumper stickers on all of our cars.
[01:20:56.765 --> 01:21:00.888]  Let's expose the fact that we're aware of these people's agenda and say we're not afraid of you, bully.
[01:21:01.448 --> 01:21:02.629]  We're never going to shut up.
[01:21:02.890 --> 01:21:06.573]  We're never going to back down because ideas are bulletproof.
[01:21:07.739 --> 01:21:14.702]  Most of the 100,000 shirts that we've sold in the last 15 months or so, we've sold at or near cost.
[01:21:15.602 --> 01:21:22.586]  And ladies and gentlemen, right through to the election, we are going to be selling the shirts at cost for $9.95.
[01:21:23.686 --> 01:21:30.809]  That's $5 for the shirt, $5 for shipping and handling, including all the taxes and the rest of it that we have to pay.
[01:21:31.149 --> 01:21:33.290]  So in many cases, we're actually losing money on this.
[01:21:34.211 --> 01:21:36.892]  But what we saw happen in Cleveland was so amazing.
[01:21:37.657 --> 01:21:48.162]  Where there were tens of thousands of the shirts on the street, big banners we paid for, being towed through the sky, saying Hillary for prison, getting international news attention.
[01:21:48.462 --> 01:21:49.243]  It was amazing.
[01:21:50.043 --> 01:21:59.568]  And it showed not just the mainstream media or the corrupt government, but we the people, the fact that the Liberty Movement is actually incredibly strong and incredibly popular.
[01:22:00.168 --> 01:22:02.390]  And it also showed Donald Trump that.
[01:22:03.210 --> 01:22:06.672]  The truth is, Americans are hungry for liberty.
[01:22:07.523 --> 01:22:12.208]  But people all over the world are hungry for liberty as well, and are aware of the globalist takeover of this planet.
[01:22:13.049 --> 01:22:20.337]  And so even if Hillary has gotten off her crimes so far, because of the incredible corruption of the Justice Department, it doesn't matter.
[01:22:20.717 --> 01:22:23.720]  We are convicting her in the court of public opinion.
[01:22:24.381 --> 01:22:29.586]  That's why she's come out and said I'm one of her main enemies, and called me Dark Heart Alex Jones.
[01:22:30.327 --> 01:22:32.749]  Because the truth is, I don't have a dark heart.
[01:22:33.309 --> 01:22:45.157]  I have a loving heart, just like our listeners and viewers do, and we have the courage, you have the courage, to wear these shirts openly and to meet like-minded people and to stir conversation with others and hopefully inform them.
[01:22:45.638 --> 01:22:48.119]  Many of you have already gotten your Hillary for President t-shirt.
[01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:49.420]  You've helped spread the word.
[01:22:49.881 --> 01:22:53.143]  You've created what's probably the most popular meme of the 2016 historic election.
[01:22:55.316 --> 01:23:00.859]  I'm asking you to go to the next level and order another shirt today and give it to friends, neighbors, family.
[01:23:01.739 --> 01:23:09.203]  I'm also asking you to take the bumper stickers that say Hillary for prison in each order and put them on your cars or put them in public places where it's legal and lawful.
[01:23:09.764 --> 01:23:19.109]  Because this message absolutely has to punch through the media, as Donald Trump has said, and expose the fact that she may have corrupt courts and the corrupt Justice Department
[01:23:20.129 --> 01:23:24.012]  No bill her for being indicted, but in the court of public opinion, we're taking action.
[01:23:24.532 --> 01:23:34.400]  When Hillary Clinton threatens us, when Hillary Clinton turns her dogs loose on us, when Hillary Clinton has mainstream media basically death threat us, we don't back down, we go to the next level.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:45.887]  That's why I'm encouraging you, if you haven't got the t-shirts, to join all the other great InfoWarriors in history and get your Hillary for Prison 2016 shirt today.
[01:23:46.407 --> 01:24:00.636]  But whether it's a Molon Labe shirt, or a Come and Take It shirt, or an InfoWars.com shirt, you get InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding the very front lines of the fight against the globalists in America's darkest hour.
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:32.655]  You know, I realize that I'm almost like a rabid barking dog half the time on the show because I've got so much information, so much I want to get out, and then so much frustration, not in my crew, they're amazing, just in myself, that it's worse than I'm saying, and it's so transparent, and if the people would open their eyes, it could all end.
[01:24:34.053 --> 01:24:42.819]  Well, was it four, four and a half weeks ago, I come out, put on a case for election fraud in the last election, in the primaries, robbing Bernie Sanders, trying to rob Trump.
[01:24:43.219 --> 01:24:43.940]  I show the clips.
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:47.142]  I show the history of fraud in a little short six minute video.
[01:24:47.762 --> 01:24:49.583]  I asked Donald Trump to investigate it.
[01:24:49.624 --> 01:24:50.664]  He's already investigating it.
[01:24:52.005 --> 01:24:55.608]  He comes out a few days later and basically breaks down the facts.
[01:24:56.808 --> 01:25:00.351]  Not repeating what I said, but repeating the facts.
[01:25:01.803 --> 01:25:03.564]  They call facts conspiracy theories.
[01:25:03.985 --> 01:25:04.765]  It's a fact.
[01:25:04.845 --> 01:25:09.789]  Stanford Research Institute came out a month ago and said Bernie Sanders was robbed.
[01:25:10.069 --> 01:25:11.070]  He should have been the nominee.
[01:25:11.410 --> 01:25:11.950]  He won.
[01:25:13.511 --> 01:25:15.032]  Well, I don't need Stanford Research.
[01:25:15.153 --> 01:25:17.214]  I was there watching fraud per state.
[01:25:17.774 --> 01:25:20.736]  It was in CNN.com.
[01:25:20.777 --> 01:25:22.458]  It was in the New York Daily News.
[01:25:24.445 --> 01:25:30.167]  But they met the day before in California and decided who the delegates were going to go for.
[01:25:30.747 --> 01:25:32.748]  Didn't matter they had the election the next day.
[01:25:33.048 --> 01:25:35.008]  That is earth-shaking.
[01:25:38.449 --> 01:25:46.152]  So then Obama comes out and addresses the conspiracy theory from Texas, not even saying my name, and tells the press corps it doesn't exist.
[01:25:46.652 --> 01:25:48.012]  There's no such thing as election fraud.
[01:25:48.433 --> 01:25:49.553]  But now it blew up in their face.
[01:25:49.653 --> 01:25:52.674]  A month later, they're now all over the news saying Russians.
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:55.941]  Are in our computers.
[01:25:56.141 --> 01:25:56.742]  They're in them.
[01:25:56.942 --> 01:25:59.544]  They're in the election computers, and they've got to be stopped.
[01:25:59.584 --> 01:26:02.046]  So Homeland Security, that's the offshore globalist.
[01:26:02.246 --> 01:26:03.527]  That's who really took the country over.
[01:26:03.907 --> 01:26:08.290]  They're going to protect us from the Russians by taking over the election.
[01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:09.871]  Sensational!
[01:26:10.112 --> 01:26:18.238]  And then here's a clip of Hillary yesterday, before she had to stop her fake press conference, with a few of her friends, hacking, talking about the Russians and our elections.
[01:26:18.298 --> 01:26:19.398]  So, which way is it?
[01:26:19.519 --> 01:26:19.839]  Here it is.
[01:26:21.371 --> 01:26:23.493]  Furthermore, he has praised Putin.
[01:26:23.533 --> 01:26:29.137]  He seems to have this bizarre attraction to dictators, including Putin.
[01:26:30.078 --> 01:26:32.080]  He won't tell us where he owes $650 million.
[01:26:34.935 --> 01:26:36.436]  There's a lot of rumors about that.
[01:26:36.896 --> 01:26:50.961]  And he has, you know, made it clear that he doesn't particularly care whether Putin and the intelligence services attack American institutions.
[01:26:51.001 --> 01:26:52.962]  So, do you have some water?
[01:26:53.002 --> 01:26:55.022]  Yeah.
[01:26:55.563 --> 01:26:58.364]  Thank you.
[01:26:59.504 --> 01:27:01.705]  She's the one attacking American institutions.
[01:27:04.113 --> 01:27:07.736]  And then she goes on to say they're getting involved in the elections, we have to do something about it.
[01:27:07.836 --> 01:27:09.257]  I'll cue it up during the break and we'll play it.
[01:27:09.777 --> 01:27:12.319]  But the point is that this is a big deal.
[01:27:12.979 --> 01:27:26.989]  Now, Larry Nichols is our guest, we'll hold him some in the next segment, but Larry, what are we seeing here from your inside political eye, knowing the Clintons, denying election fraud, saying it doesn't exist, but now having Homeland Security come in and take over elections?
[01:27:27.788 --> 01:27:29.069]  Alright, Alex, it's simple.
[01:27:29.229 --> 01:27:31.031]  One of the rules that we always had.
[01:27:31.492 --> 01:27:34.695]  This is a fun foundational principle with the Clintons.
[01:27:35.275 --> 01:27:38.658]  You always accuse your opponent of what you're doing.
[01:27:39.779 --> 01:27:40.160]  Always.
[01:27:41.081 --> 01:27:47.507]  Now, what that means is, when I accuse you, Alex, of something that I'm doing, guess what?
[01:27:48.328 --> 01:27:52.572]  I know all the angles, so I can tell all kinds of stuff in detail.
[01:27:54.324 --> 01:27:56.406]  That nobody could possibly know.
[01:27:56.966 --> 01:27:59.288]  So it proves my point about you.
[01:27:59.888 --> 01:28:07.213]  When I've got all of these exacting details, number one, but the scariest thing of all, they're using this.
[01:28:07.914 --> 01:28:10.716]  They're using this as a way to do what?
[01:28:11.456 --> 01:28:14.698]  Bring in somebody to oversee it.
[01:28:14.839 --> 01:28:17.901]  And who controls the people that are going to be overseeing it?
[01:28:18.661 --> 01:28:19.122]  They do.
[01:28:20.443 --> 01:28:20.823]  They do.
[01:28:22.064 --> 01:28:23.885]  So it's an absolute
[01:28:24.836 --> 01:28:31.680]  Unbelievable play to get absolute control of computerized voting.
[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:41.026]  What do you make of the fact that they're using the EU slash UN Security Service of the OECD and they've added 10 times quote the observers they had in 2012.
[01:28:41.546 --> 01:28:42.867]  There it is on screen from Reuters.
[01:28:43.007 --> 01:28:48.610]  OSCE rights group requests 500 international observers to monitor US presidential vote.
[01:28:50.811 --> 01:28:51.572]  Can you believe it?
[01:28:52.105 --> 01:28:54.907]  What I'm going to tell you next, Alex, goes right in with this.
[01:28:55.047 --> 01:28:57.629]  All of the sudden we're bringing in U.N.
[01:28:58.409 --> 01:29:00.110]  That's what you wanted to talk about this morning.
[01:29:00.150 --> 01:29:01.391]  So give people a preview before we go to break.
[01:29:01.411 --> 01:29:03.573]  You said, I want to talk about the U.N.
[01:29:03.593 --> 01:29:05.034]  taking over the Internet October 1st.
[01:29:05.654 --> 01:29:06.074]  Well, the U.N.
[01:29:06.154 --> 01:29:11.658]  is taking over the Internet October 1st, but there is another thing that happens that most people have no idea.
[01:29:11.798 --> 01:29:14.139]  In the same agreement, the U.N.
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:19.923]  takes over our health care in a play that nobody is going to believe, but it's there.
[01:29:19.983 --> 01:29:20.684]  Part of the TPP?
[01:29:21.721 --> 01:29:22.182]  You got it.
[01:29:22.202 --> 01:29:23.383]  It's over Alex if we don't stop it.
[01:29:23.463 --> 01:29:23.824]  It's over.
[01:29:23.884 --> 01:29:24.304]  I've told y'all that.
[01:29:24.324 --> 01:29:25.886]  I've said it and said it and of course I look like an idiot.
[01:29:36.817 --> 01:29:37.017]  Stay there.
[01:29:37.037 --> 01:29:38.558]  I'm going to give you the floor for 10 minutes when we come back.
[01:29:38.578 --> 01:29:39.719]  Then I'm going to let you go.
[01:29:39.759 --> 01:29:41.320]  I appreciate your time, especially with your health.
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:42.781]  Everybody needs to pray for Larry Nichols.
[01:29:43.561 --> 01:29:43.982]  This is it.
[01:29:44.262 --> 01:29:44.882]  2016 is it.
[01:29:44.902 --> 01:29:45.723]  The military knows.
[01:29:46.163 --> 01:29:46.784]  Trump knows.
[01:29:47.864 --> 01:29:53.348]  The globalists are all over their major publications saying this is their year, this is their takedown, this is their big offensive.
[01:29:53.628 --> 01:29:56.610]  If they lose, they're on the defense just like Hitler.
[01:29:56.990 --> 01:29:58.071]  This is their battle of the bulge.
[01:29:58.971 --> 01:29:59.872]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.352 --> 01:30:01.973]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.894 --> 01:30:05.576]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.873 --> 01:30:18.905]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:30:18.985 --> 01:30:27.096]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:30:27.376 --> 01:30:32.058]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:30:32.238 --> 01:30:38.921]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:30:39.041 --> 01:30:46.123]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:30:46.203 --> 01:30:53.066]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:30:53.226 --> 01:30:57.591]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:30:57.711 --> 01:31:00.975]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:31:01.115 --> 01:31:07.241]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:31:07.402 --> 01:31:09.364]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[01:31:09.804 --> 01:31:11.846]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[01:31:11.866 --> 01:31:14.028]  Does Hillary Clinton have Parkinson's disease?
[01:31:14.148 --> 01:31:16.991]  We can all see that she has some very serious health problems.
[01:31:17.091 --> 01:31:18.732]  Article up by Michael Snyder.
[01:31:18.873 --> 01:31:25.759]  It has been my contention for a long time that Hillary Clinton would do or say just about anything in order to become the first woman president.
[01:31:25.939 --> 01:31:30.602]  But would she actually lie to the American people about her health in order to reach that historic achievement?
[01:31:30.702 --> 01:31:36.786]  In recent days, the Clinton campaign has assured us over and over again about how healthy Hillary is.
[01:31:36.946 --> 01:31:42.350]  And she even opened up a jar of pickles for Jimmy Kimmel in order to prove how vigorous she is at her age.
[01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:45.411]  But we can all see that she has some very serious health problems.
[01:31:45.632 --> 01:31:47.693]  On Labor Day, Clinton had another one of her epic
[01:31:47.773 --> 01:31:48.173]  We're good.
[01:32:09.631 --> 01:32:15.793]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:32:16.173 --> 01:32:19.054]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:32:19.394 --> 01:32:24.595]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:32:25.015 --> 01:32:30.977]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:32:31.117 --> 01:32:34.238]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:32:34.398 --> 01:32:35.838]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[01:32:36.058 --> 01:32:40.201]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:32:40.401 --> 01:32:43.264]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:32:43.344 --> 01:32:44.905]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:32:45.005 --> 01:32:48.188]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:32:48.468 --> 01:32:50.810]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:32:51.090 --> 01:32:52.051]  It's in powder form.
[01:32:52.131 --> 01:32:54.853]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:32:55.013 --> 01:32:55.613]  I take this.
[01:32:55.734 --> 01:32:57.415]  This is the product that I take.
[01:32:57.535 --> 01:32:59.517]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[01:33:00.337 --> 01:33:01.098]  We fight the Globals.
[01:33:01.118 --> 01:33:01.958]  We fight the New World Order.

[01:33:07.983 --> 01:33:08.583]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:08.723 --> 01:33:18.230]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:22.333]  For everything, there is a season, as the Bible tells us.
[01:33:29.986 --> 01:33:34.888]  And we are in that season right now.
[01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:39.971]  A season of decision.
[01:33:41.351 --> 01:33:50.036]  Because there is major free will in this universe and we are abandoning God's law, natural law, common sense for globalist law.
[01:33:50.816 --> 01:33:53.037]  That it's whatever they say it is and it changes day to day.
[01:33:53.057 --> 01:33:54.378]  And it's designed to
[01:33:55.919 --> 01:33:57.539]  Set evil on top of good.
[01:33:57.559 --> 01:34:00.040]  We're going to go back to Larry Nichols here in a moment.
[01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:02.101]  Very important to pray for him and support him too.
[01:34:02.141 --> 01:34:03.101]  He's battling cancer.
[01:34:03.121 --> 01:34:04.681]  We'll put his PayPal on screen.
[01:34:04.701 --> 01:34:06.922]  In fact, I would have given that out, but I don't have that on screen.
[01:34:07.202 --> 01:34:08.702]  So we'll see if we can put that up on screen.
[01:34:09.562 --> 01:34:14.904]  It is NicholsLiveAtAOL.com and you can make a donation there or write to him.
[01:34:14.944 --> 01:34:18.205]  Larry Nichols, 58 Kingston Drive, Conway, Arkansas 72034.
[01:34:20.225 --> 01:34:27.087]  We try to take care of special guests we've been interviewing for 20 plus years, especially when this guy has been fighting really hard.
[01:34:27.547 --> 01:34:31.568]  He came on the day after he had heart surgery a few weeks ago, then we weren't able to get him on because he's been sick.
[01:34:32.088 --> 01:34:37.029]  And he's on via telephone today, 58 Kensington Drive, Conway, Arkansas 72034, or NicholsLive at AOL.com.
[01:34:41.909 --> 01:34:45.833]  Now, speaking of funding our operation, we don't do this special very often.
[01:34:45.933 --> 01:34:46.914]  Used to, it was once a year.
[01:34:47.434 --> 01:34:51.858]  But I've been doing it every few months because obviously there's a quickening, people know stuff's going on now.
[01:34:52.259 --> 01:34:57.103]  We have the highest quality MyPatriot supply, full spectrum of their food, drop shipped directly from them.
[01:34:58.124 --> 01:35:04.090]  We're able to get around the fact that we already have the lowest prices, because we sell their full spectrum of food as well, at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:35:04.350 --> 01:35:05.852]  Ships from the very same factory in Utah.
[01:35:07.066 --> 01:35:12.489]  If you want to get 30 to 40% off, InfoWars selects storable food at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:35:12.949 --> 01:35:19.973]  FEMA reports and predicts a 395% increase in food prices that could trigger mass unrest in the next five years.
[01:35:20.013 --> 01:35:20.733]  That's mainstream news.
[01:35:21.193 --> 01:35:23.795]  Now is the time to stock up on storable food for you and your family.
[01:35:24.155 --> 01:35:26.156]  I hope that doesn't happen, but it's insurance you can eat.
[01:35:26.936 --> 01:35:34.040]  Get 30 to 40% off of retail price on all InfoWars storable food at InfoWarsStore.com to help get ready.
[01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:36.521]  They're all about making us dependent on them.
[01:35:36.561 --> 01:35:37.562]  We need to be independent.
[01:35:37.942 --> 01:35:43.066]  All InfoWars Select Foods, and that's the brand name, it's not just Select ones, it's the full line of Select.
[01:35:43.446 --> 01:35:48.630]  InfoWars Select Brand Foods have a shelf life of 25 years and are made in the USA.
[01:35:48.990 --> 01:35:52.733]  Start getting prepared before food prices skyrocket, as they could, they already are.
[01:35:53.233 --> 01:35:58.877]  Get 30-40% off all InfoWars Select Storeable Foods and InfoWarsStore.com for a limited time while supplies last.
[01:35:58.897 --> 01:36:00.198]  We'll probably only be able
[01:36:01.547 --> 01:36:03.007]  To run this for a week.
[01:36:03.688 --> 01:36:05.488]  And we're doing this in the month of September.
[01:36:05.608 --> 01:36:06.969]  It is preparedness month.
[01:36:06.989 --> 01:36:09.230]  30-40% off on a lot of other survival goods.
[01:36:09.690 --> 01:36:11.950]  20% off survival shield nascent iodine X2.
[01:36:12.751 --> 01:36:16.932]  20% off all Alexa Pure indoor air filters that are only 200 bucks normally.
[01:36:16.992 --> 01:36:18.112]  They're even less than that right now.
[01:36:19.913 --> 01:36:24.736]  Competitors are 400 bucks to 500, some 1,000 that do the same thing.
[01:36:24.756 --> 01:36:29.719]  20% off Alexa Pure water filters and many, many others.
[01:36:29.799 --> 01:36:33.482]  Visit infowarestore.com today and take action.
[01:36:33.622 --> 01:36:40.426]  Also, we have the film Amerageddon, a fictional account of a possible globalist-style takeover that's great to wake people up.
[01:36:40.946 --> 01:36:43.348]  And we have a lot of other specials running as well.
[01:36:43.468 --> 01:36:44.389]  And InfoWars,
[01:36:45.475 --> 01:36:48.676]  Life.com, that is the subsection of Infowars.
[01:36:48.896 --> 01:36:56.038]  Store.com, that's the umbrella site, or simply call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:36:56.658 --> 01:37:00.399]  And your purchase of the products makes everything we do here possible.
[01:37:00.439 --> 01:37:13.342]  So, Larry Nichols, looking at this, it's very clear, not just here, but all over the world, whether it's internet censorship or control or targeted assassinations or
[01:37:15.067 --> 01:37:25.079]  Globalists not even fixing nuclear reactors that are leaking, or power grabbing, media censorship, the media lapdogs going further than ever censoring.
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:28.303]  All Hades, it seems, is breaking loose.
[01:37:28.383 --> 01:37:30.645]  And it was already accelerating, but it seemed like
[01:37:31.326 --> 01:37:40.813]  We passed a demarcation line September 1st, and everything we already saw that was amplified 100% in the last year went up 200% more.
[01:37:41.213 --> 01:37:47.157]  I mean, it was like just a massive next level, and now it's clear the acceleration is clearly happening.
[01:37:47.437 --> 01:37:48.918]  What are we witnessing, Larry Nichols?
[01:37:50.219 --> 01:37:53.862]  You're witnessing what I told you about, Alex, a few months ago.
[01:37:53.882 --> 01:37:59.786]  Remember when I was telling you and your listeners, we're at the beginning of the beginning.
[01:38:00.766 --> 01:38:06.128]  of the end of the silent coup, the velvet coup.
[01:38:06.348 --> 01:38:07.208]  You're seeing it now.
[01:38:08.328 --> 01:38:10.309]  You're seeing it manifest itself.
[01:38:11.129 --> 01:38:14.030]  Now I want to say something, I'll interrupt everything for just a second, folks.
[01:38:14.090 --> 01:38:17.711]  I'm telling you this as straightforward and honest as I can.
[01:38:17.731 --> 01:38:22.132]  I appreciate Alex and all of y'all trying to help me, but if it comes down
[01:38:23.277 --> 01:38:31.964]  To the money you have, you have to make a choice between getting some of the incredible products that Alex has got to sustain you or me.
[01:38:33.045 --> 01:38:34.486]  You've got to support this program.
[01:38:35.287 --> 01:38:37.608]  Folks, this program is all we're going to have here soon.
[01:38:38.249 --> 01:38:39.690]  It's all we got soon.
[01:38:40.991 --> 01:38:43.273]  So please, please,
[01:38:44.022 --> 01:38:46.364]  Alex is doing the best he can.
[01:38:46.384 --> 01:38:48.505]  I'm not here to be patronizing.
[01:38:48.545 --> 01:38:53.189]  I'm just here trying to save my country for my grandbabies, for all of you.
[01:38:53.549 --> 01:38:55.850]  Now, let me tell you something, Alex, that's coming.
[01:38:55.890 --> 01:39:00.113]  Number one, people need to come here because I will help you.
[01:39:00.134 --> 01:39:03.556]  You know, I've rigged more elections, Alex, than most people have voted in.
[01:39:03.796 --> 01:39:04.236]  I've done it.
[01:39:04.256 --> 01:39:04.897]  I've rigged them.
[01:39:05.577 --> 01:39:05.978]  I admit it.
[01:39:05.998 --> 01:39:07.979]  I'm not proud of it, but I did it.
[01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:12.002]  It's because I did that I know how to twiddle with them and save them.
[01:39:13.277 --> 01:39:29.350]  We're going to have a program right here, Alex, if people will come showing how to do poll watching to the point where we can stop this massive, single greatest effort they have to rig this election, which is the multiple voting.
[01:39:30.311 --> 01:39:31.812]  That's we can stop, Alex.
[01:39:31.872 --> 01:39:34.294]  We can stop it with your audience right here.
[01:39:34.815 --> 01:39:38.197]  If people will come here and let's teach them and show them how to do it.
[01:39:38.277 --> 01:39:38.838]  Number one.
[01:39:38.898 --> 01:39:39.398]  Number two.
[01:39:41.062 --> 01:39:43.724]  In that TPP, there's another little thing.
[01:39:44.245 --> 01:39:47.968]  There are 29 facts about TPP.
[01:39:48.749 --> 01:39:54.033]  Five of them have to do with the trade, which is what we think it's supposed to be about, right?
[01:39:55.214 --> 01:39:58.577]  Only five have to do with trade.
[01:39:59.658 --> 01:40:03.842]  Twenty-four others have to do with stuff that ain't got nothing to do with trade.
[01:40:03.922 --> 01:40:08.186]  Number one would be, like, the computer stuff October the 1st.
[01:40:09.454 --> 01:40:10.814]  But here's the scary one.
[01:40:12.315 --> 01:40:15.795]  I have told y'all that Obama announced himself.
[01:40:15.935 --> 01:40:17.216]  They said it, I didn't.
[01:40:17.356 --> 01:40:31.999]  The Obama people said a couple, three months ago, that on November the 15th or the 17th, I can't remember why, I can't tell you which one date it was, but on that day, full Obamacare kicks in.
[01:40:32.779 --> 01:40:38.620]  And when full Obamacare kicks in, your healthcare insurance premium
[01:40:39.602 --> 01:40:49.710]  They said we'll go up somewhere between 200 to 2,000 percent.
[01:40:50.171 --> 01:40:52.152]  200 to 2,000 percent.
[01:40:53.353 --> 01:40:55.075]  Well, I found out last week.
[01:40:55.916 --> 01:41:00.379]  Alex knows who I found out, but I can't tell y'all because of the risk.
[01:41:00.499 --> 01:41:04.623]  But included in TPP,
[01:41:06.997 --> 01:41:12.061]  It includes a provision having to do with the American health care program.
[01:41:13.622 --> 01:41:21.308]  But what they're talking about is Obamacare global health care system.
[01:41:22.989 --> 01:41:27.673]  The establishment of a global health care plan.
[01:41:29.314 --> 01:41:32.857]  And what that means, Alex, is we in America
[01:41:34.039 --> 01:41:35.981]  Are going to be picking up the tab.
[01:41:36.081 --> 01:41:36.821]  Now remember.
[01:41:37.882 --> 01:41:48.811]  Under Obamacare, the problem is by the time we pick up the tab for all the people that choose not to have health care or can't afford it, it's bankrupting us.
[01:41:49.572 --> 01:41:57.619]  When now we're going to find out the 15th of November that we're fixing to pick up under the terms of this U.N.
[01:41:57.659 --> 01:41:58.159]  agreement.
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:01.142]  We're fixing to pick up the health care costs.
[01:42:02.099 --> 01:42:08.501]  For Zimbabwe, Kenya, you name nowhere country in the world, we're picking it all up.
[01:42:10.222 --> 01:42:14.604]  It will literally drive us into bankruptcy.
[01:42:15.104 --> 01:42:15.264]  Us.
[01:42:17.885 --> 01:42:18.025]  Us.
[01:42:19.226 --> 01:42:22.407]  Now, we gotta stop that, Alex.
[01:42:23.251 --> 01:42:23.731]  Absolutely.
[01:42:23.771 --> 01:42:24.872]  Look at Venezuela.
[01:42:25.032 --> 01:42:27.293]  Look at what's happening all over the world.
[01:42:27.313 --> 01:42:27.973]  Look at Greece.
[01:42:28.053 --> 01:42:28.753]  Look at Spain.
[01:42:28.793 --> 01:42:29.574]  Look at Portugal.
[01:42:29.614 --> 01:42:30.154]  Look at Italy.
[01:42:30.614 --> 01:42:35.016]  They are installing leaders in major European countries.
[01:42:35.076 --> 01:42:39.158]  And it's on the news that, quote, Goldman Sachs runs our country now.
[01:42:39.498 --> 01:42:41.599]  And every time you turn around, it's Goldman Sachs.
[01:42:42.079 --> 01:42:50.223]  Whether it's gun control, open borders, globalism, it is this one bank, along with JPMorgan Chase, that run the whole stinkin' show.
[01:42:51.023 --> 01:42:52.324]  And do you think
[01:42:53.064 --> 01:43:03.191]  They're being truthful when they say in the Financial Times and the Economist and the Washington Post, obviously communicating with their own crew members, that the New World Order is in deep trouble if Hillary doesn't win.
[01:43:03.211 --> 01:43:04.912]  I mean, are they all in for her?
[01:43:04.952 --> 01:43:13.719]  Because if they'll censor, if they'll engage in all these threats, if they'll let her commit all these crimes, clearly she is the embodiment of their hopes and dreams.
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:17.361]  I believe without any shadow of a doubt.
[01:43:17.541 --> 01:43:18.722]  Now this is my belief.
[01:43:18.842 --> 01:43:21.004]  I cannot prove this in a court of law.
[01:43:21.684 --> 01:43:22.545]  This is my feeling.
[01:43:23.661 --> 01:43:33.027]  They have fought so very hard against Donald Trump because Donald Trump, they fear, is about America.
[01:43:34.388 --> 01:43:49.257]  And whoever becomes president of the United States to comply with this global, one world, global governance system, you cannot have a person at the presidency of this country that believes in America first.
[01:43:49.537 --> 01:43:49.977]  You can't.
[01:43:50.337 --> 01:43:50.918]  You can't do it.
[01:43:50.958 --> 01:43:51.438]  It don't work.
[01:43:52.466 --> 01:43:54.168]  They have got to stop Trump.
[01:43:55.268 --> 01:43:57.410]  And if they stop Trump, they stop us.
[01:43:58.531 --> 01:44:00.573]  That's Hillary's strength, and she knows it.
[01:44:00.593 --> 01:44:02.154]  Hillary's setting back, Alex.
[01:44:02.194 --> 01:44:04.196]  She's on a dream ride of her life.
[01:44:04.817 --> 01:44:09.321]  She's sitting here with all these global interests that are sitting there.
[01:44:10.261 --> 01:44:12.783]  All she's got to do is just sit back and let them do all the work.
[01:44:12.803 --> 01:44:14.425]  Let me give you another quick example.
[01:44:15.265 --> 01:44:21.767]  Remember, what is the greatest single fraud committed against the American people when it comes to this election?
[01:44:22.287 --> 01:44:24.388]  And that's going to be the multiple voting.
[01:44:26.408 --> 01:44:30.569]  Several states have introduced voter ID laws.
[01:44:31.649 --> 01:44:34.450]  Now, figure this one out, Alex.
[01:44:34.530 --> 01:44:43.613]  We found out a couple of weeks ago or a month ago, whenever it was, that George Soros had committed, along with the DNC,
[01:44:45.279 --> 01:44:50.785]  They had committed to this law firm a guy named Elias Senor Ellison, however you pronounce his name.
[01:44:50.825 --> 01:44:51.225]  Sure, sure.
[01:44:51.265 --> 01:44:52.346]  I mean, let me quantify it.
[01:44:52.386 --> 01:44:53.207]  It's in all the emails.
[01:44:53.247 --> 01:44:57.191]  They said we're going to bring in foreigners and get illegals to vote and this is how we're going to break the U.S.
[01:44:57.311 --> 01:44:57.411]  up.
[01:44:57.471 --> 01:44:58.572]  It's the same strategy in Europe.
[01:44:58.773 --> 01:44:59.874]  We have his emails there as well.
[01:45:00.855 --> 01:45:06.680]  And they're going to put in three and a half million dollars for him to go around
[01:45:08.078 --> 01:45:11.261]  And to fight, get this, to fight...
[01:45:28.277 --> 01:45:28.497]  You bet.
[01:45:28.517 --> 01:45:31.078]  Well, you gotta see this one little trick, because it's deadly.
[01:45:31.098 --> 01:45:34.719]  They're going out with this Allianz Group, and they're funding two things.
[01:45:34.739 --> 01:45:35.719]  They gave them two orders.
[01:45:35.739 --> 01:45:36.979]  Fight, number one, voter ID laws.
[01:45:58.607 --> 01:46:01.991]  Because that allows for multiple voting.
[01:46:02.712 --> 01:46:07.217]  But the other thing that they're giving him money for is to fight what, Alex?
[01:46:07.297 --> 01:46:10.240]  They're giving him money to fight states' rights initiatives.
[01:46:11.041 --> 01:46:11.722]  States' rights.
[01:46:12.463 --> 01:46:12.863]  Why?
[01:46:13.484 --> 01:46:14.445]  Well, think about it.
[01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:16.461]  They've got us in the court.
[01:46:16.801 --> 01:46:17.442]  Any state.
[01:46:17.522 --> 01:46:22.405]  I've told everybody I can to tell their governor, you go in federal court, you've lost.
[01:46:22.465 --> 01:46:23.626]  You're in with the black vote.
[01:46:23.646 --> 01:46:25.087]  The states just have to ignore it.
[01:46:25.468 --> 01:46:27.109]  Now the courts at the federal level are gone.
[01:46:27.129 --> 01:46:32.192]  We have to go with the states and we have to reconstitute the republic in a new constitutional convention with the states.
[01:46:32.212 --> 01:46:35.135]  And I was never for a CON CON because they could use it to overthrow us.
[01:46:35.155 --> 01:46:36.175]  They already have.
[01:46:36.596 --> 01:46:40.238]  We are in an emergency brain surgery, heart surgery right now.
[01:46:40.598 --> 01:46:41.919]  We have got to save this country.
[01:46:41.999 --> 01:46:42.700]  And here's the good news.
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:43.701]  And I want to add this here, Larry.
[01:46:44.642 --> 01:46:47.624]  They came to totally overrun the UK with globalist tyranny.
[01:46:47.885 --> 01:46:48.885]  The people voted to leave it.
[01:46:48.985 --> 01:46:51.267]  Doesn't mean the fight's over, but they're going in the right direction.
[01:46:51.608 --> 01:46:54.790]  Donald Trump has risen up in opposition.
[01:46:54.890 --> 01:46:59.174]  As the Bible says, when the enemy comes in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against it.
[01:46:59.534 --> 01:47:00.635]  So the good news is,
[01:47:01.655 --> 01:47:07.316]  You can see nationalism and the understanding of the New World Order growing and expanding, Larry.
[01:47:07.576 --> 01:47:12.958]  And that really scares the New World Order and is making them accelerate their plan that was already in trouble.
[01:47:13.258 --> 01:47:16.478]  And I believe they've miscalculated and are starting to bleed out.
[01:47:16.779 --> 01:47:24.120]  And I think medium term, we're going to win because they may try to bring in an absolute authoritarianism and really try to censor and shut us down.
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:27.661]  And at that moment, the military and others are ready to stand up.
[01:47:28.473 --> 01:47:36.219]  You know, Alex, it's all kind of down to this, and I think this is why I say your program, your network is so important.
[01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:39.781]  We've got to have someplace to gather.
[01:47:40.041 --> 01:47:40.562]  You're right.
[01:47:40.682 --> 01:47:42.003]  We can stop this.
[01:47:42.923 --> 01:47:43.904]  We can stop it.
[01:47:43.944 --> 01:47:47.126]  You know we can stop it because they're so afraid of us.
[01:47:48.207 --> 01:47:53.891]  Hey, look, if they didn't think we could stop it, you know, Alex, they wouldn't give two hoots and a tinker.
[01:47:53.911 --> 01:47:55.513]  They're engaged in huge crimes.
[01:47:55.533 --> 01:47:56.273]  It's outrageous.
[01:47:56.333 --> 01:47:57.334]  All we've got to do is expose it.
[01:47:58.090 --> 01:48:11.275]  Expose it, engage the enemy, and Alex, that's what I promise all of you, as long as I can, and I don't know how long that is, but every breath I breathe, I will help get through this election.
[01:48:11.375 --> 01:48:19.178]  We can win this election by using poll watchers that know what they're looking for and in the right place.
[01:48:19.198 --> 01:48:20.979]  All right, Larry, let me stop you right there.
[01:48:20.999 --> 01:48:23.320]  And then we can go and put pressure on government.
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:24.760]  Larry, we're out of time.
[01:48:25.341 --> 01:48:26.961]  We're working with Roger Stone on that.
[01:48:26.981 --> 01:48:27.542]  He's on tomorrow.
[01:48:27.562 --> 01:48:28.622]  We're working with others on it.
[01:48:29.002 --> 01:48:33.204]  We're going to war game with Dr. Pachenik again, coming up for 30 minutes in the next hour.
[01:48:33.224 --> 01:48:34.945]  And then I'm going to cover other news after he leaves us.
[01:48:34.985 --> 01:48:35.705]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:48:36.225 --> 01:48:37.146]  History's happening.
[01:48:37.586 --> 01:48:40.287]  Thank you so much for your time and your energy.
[01:48:40.447 --> 01:48:42.068]  And again, the good news is here.
[01:48:43.649 --> 01:48:48.151]  I got contacted by a lot of different police over the weekend, some of them senior.
[01:48:48.851 --> 01:48:53.013]  And they said, you know, Alex, it's one thing to read it at Info Wars or Breitbart.
[01:48:54.082 --> 01:49:14.656]  But we actually now have the Justice Department and the UN actually came in last week and told us they're taking control and get ready for a big emergency and the police are all standing there actually hearing get ready for the UN, get ready for political correctness, get ready show the attempted coup physically
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:16.781]  is what's going to bring them down.
[01:49:16.841 --> 01:49:26.565]  They've had their soft coup, as you said, but I'm telling you, I don't, I really, the reason they're scared is they know, Larry, that the police and military are finally really waking up.
[01:49:26.785 --> 01:49:34.909]  Not that they're perfect, but they really get, wow, foreign globalist scum are going to overthrow the whole country and gut it, and they understand it's going to destroy prosperity.
[01:49:35.309 --> 01:49:42.033]  Even people that aren't perfect don't want to destroy prosperity and have a creepy feeling right now, and the attitude is they're ready to stand up.
[01:49:42.613 --> 01:49:43.453]  A, what do you think of that?
[01:49:43.513 --> 01:49:44.334]  And B, in one minute,
[01:49:45.134 --> 01:49:47.335]  How will the globalists strike back against something like that?
[01:49:48.295 --> 01:49:50.796]  Well, number one, I believe in it 100%.
[01:49:52.116 --> 01:49:53.596]  The police have had enough.
[01:49:54.517 --> 01:49:58.618]  And they've counted on the police just laying down and walking away from their jobs.
[01:49:58.678 --> 01:49:59.198]  Guess what?
[01:49:59.298 --> 01:50:00.759]  That's not happening, Alex.
[01:50:01.459 --> 01:50:05.340]  The police are not just having blue flu and walking away.
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:07.781]  The police are standing up.
[01:50:08.701 --> 01:50:11.122]  And I'm telling you, the globalists are in trouble.
[01:50:11.282 --> 01:50:12.422]  Now, they're not going to admit it.
[01:50:13.766 --> 01:50:22.412]  But Alex, if we will unify, if we will stand together, and I'm not talking about one of these things where you stand around singing Kumbaya and all there's work to be done.
[01:50:22.452 --> 01:50:23.633]  Don't comply with the globalists.
[01:50:23.673 --> 01:50:24.773]  Expose them at every front.
[01:50:25.094 --> 01:50:25.934]  Spread the word.
[01:50:25.994 --> 01:50:26.955]  Go out and poll watch.
[01:50:27.275 --> 01:50:31.658]  Look, it only takes one or two of us to get into one of their buses when they're fake voting.
[01:50:32.178 --> 01:50:33.159]  And that's why they're scared.
[01:50:33.219 --> 01:50:34.760]  They know we're aware of them now.
[01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:35.841]  We're watching them.
[01:50:36.261 --> 01:50:36.541]  Thanks, buddy.
[01:50:36.561 --> 01:50:36.801]  See you all.
[01:50:59.571 --> 01:51:00.032]  That's right.
[01:51:00.792 --> 01:51:01.793]  We know where he's gonna be.
[01:51:01.953 --> 01:51:02.914]  Where are you gonna be?
[01:51:03.375 --> 01:51:05.257]  Get on the right side of God right now.
[01:51:05.677 --> 01:51:11.983]  Stay with us.
[01:51:12.184 --> 01:51:16.488]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[01:51:19.111 --> 01:51:21.313]  Americanism, not globalism!
[01:51:24.535 --> 01:51:28.577]  The era of economic surrender will finally be over.
[01:51:28.877 --> 01:51:34.979]  We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
[01:51:35.339 --> 01:51:42.862]  They have gotten the political establishment and the media establishment to become pure, wanton henchmen of totalitarianism.
[01:51:43.203 --> 01:51:51.606]  If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda.
[01:51:52.046 --> 01:51:54.607]  I think what the Chinese have done is really smart.
[01:51:55.107 --> 01:52:05.951]  The skyscrapers went up in Beijing and many other cities around the world, while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled right here in Detroit.
[01:52:06.271 --> 01:52:11.953]  It's all training us to accept less, lowering expectations, a post-industrial world, a new dark age.
[01:52:12.073 --> 01:52:15.914]  That's what the UN Biological Diversity Assessment 1996 calls for.
[01:52:16.155 --> 01:52:19.576]  When we abandoned the policy of America first,
[01:52:20.396 --> 01:52:24.398]  We started rebuilding other countries instead of our own.
[01:52:24.798 --> 01:52:28.920]  Not a world, Winston, that gets more beautiful and more technological and stronger.
[01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:31.981]  A world that gets uglier and stupider and more stunted.
[01:52:32.121 --> 01:52:38.824]  The government should allow Hillary Clinton to become President of the United States.
[01:52:39.344 --> 01:52:41.044]  I voted for Hillary Clinton.
[01:52:41.365 --> 01:52:42.385]  Well, I voted for Hillary.
[01:52:42.665 --> 01:52:44.666]  I guess I have to since I'm working for her as well.
[01:52:45.006 --> 01:52:46.907]  You want an image of the future, Winston?
[01:52:47.107 --> 01:52:49.267]  It's a boot stomping on a human face forever.
[01:52:49.347 --> 01:52:55.669]  Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.
[01:52:55.989 --> 01:53:00.430]  Women are treated, discriminated against in all these countries she took money against.
[01:53:00.810 --> 01:53:04.291]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely.
[01:53:04.351 --> 01:53:05.231]  They're mistreated.
[01:53:05.912 --> 01:53:07.232]  She claims to be their champion.
[01:53:07.672 --> 01:53:16.282]  Don't look at me, Winston, and see the black circles around my eyes, and see how ugly and weak I am, expressing myself and dying, and I torture people 18 hours a day, and I have a horrible life!
[01:53:16.502 --> 01:53:20.847]  That's the beauty of the satanic evil of the priest of power ripping apart humanity!
[01:53:20.987 --> 01:53:22.128]  We're here to hurt humans!
[01:53:22.228 --> 01:53:23.730]  We're here to suck your guts out!
[01:53:39.736 --> 01:53:41.597]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[01:53:41.657 --> 01:53:43.538]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[01:53:43.618 --> 01:53:46.340]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[01:53:46.540 --> 01:53:47.361]  Alex Jones.
[01:53:47.461 --> 01:53:50.222]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:53:50.262 --> 01:53:53.464]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:53:53.504 --> 01:53:54.825]  Deeply I think racist.
[01:53:54.925 --> 01:53:56.766]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[01:53:56.866 --> 01:53:58.668]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[01:53:58.688 --> 01:54:02.770]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:03.951]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:04.011 --> 01:54:08.934]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:54:13.454 --> 01:54:20.859]  I have sworn on the altar of God, eternal, vigilance, against every form of tyranny.
[01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:23.301]  Thomas Jefferson said that.
[01:54:24.922 --> 01:54:33.569]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, broadcasting worldwide from deep in the heart of occupied Texas, now known as FEMA Region 6.
[01:54:35.470 --> 01:54:40.474]  Yes, decades ago, when I talked about that, people rolled their eyes, even conservatives and patriots,
[01:54:41.701 --> 01:54:51.944]  But now, folks realize that we were losing because the enemy was so over the top, so extreme, that no one wanted to say what was actually happening because it sounded crazy!
[01:54:57.046 --> 01:54:58.226]  Total normalcy bias.
[01:54:59.548 --> 01:55:00.489]  Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:55:01.289 --> 01:55:02.290]  We must break through it.
[01:55:02.310 --> 01:55:03.511]  We must admit what's happening.
[01:55:04.111 --> 01:55:10.476]  I have stacks of articles here about censorship, internet takeovers, Obama saying, you know, we've got to control the internet.
[01:55:10.797 --> 01:55:12.538]  Really chilling things are happening.
[01:55:13.379 --> 01:55:18.683]  Because the Russians, the Russians, that's right, the Russians are taking over.
[01:55:19.243 --> 01:55:21.765]  Oh my gosh, if Trump wins, the Russians did it.
[01:55:22.205 --> 01:55:22.906]  They're actually saying that.
[01:55:25.615 --> 01:55:28.558]  From others who are saying it's election fraud to, oh we just discovered it!
[01:55:28.818 --> 01:55:29.419]  The Russians!
[01:55:29.659 --> 01:55:31.221]  Oh, oh don't worry, G.A.
[01:55:31.261 --> 01:55:32.522]  Johnson will save us!
[01:55:35.626 --> 01:55:36.667]  But I've got two different clips.
[01:55:37.728 --> 01:55:41.892]  MSNBC cuts live coverage as Hillary has one of the worst copping fits ever.
[01:55:42.233 --> 01:55:43.734]  Now you were able to see because we have the internet.
[01:55:44.995 --> 01:55:48.179]  And then separately, who saw the anointment?
[01:55:49.773 --> 01:55:56.358]  Incredible TV, high ratings, the black preachers coming over and putting the blessing on Donald Trump.
[01:55:57.399 --> 01:56:01.843]  And the clear rapport and love going on.
[01:56:03.424 --> 01:56:03.884]  Don't like it.
[01:56:05.345 --> 01:56:07.147]  So you hear him, no, no, we're supposed to cut the feed, get out of here.
[01:56:07.187 --> 01:56:12.531]  Even though they have a paid subscription service that's supposed to cover the whole deal, we could go subscribe to Thomson Reuters.
[01:56:12.571 --> 01:56:14.753]  I just don't ever work with the globalists, and maybe we should.
[01:56:15.434 --> 01:56:17.035]  And Right Side News, that's where they get their feed.
[01:56:18.598 --> 01:56:20.119]  You hear him saying, cut it, cut it, cut it.
[01:56:20.139 --> 01:56:21.660]  Don't let people see the preachers liking Trump.
[01:56:23.361 --> 01:56:24.242]  We've got those clips.
[01:56:24.882 --> 01:56:26.664]  Let's play the MSNBC clip first.
[01:56:26.704 --> 01:56:27.084]  Here it is.
[01:56:28.325 --> 01:56:29.566]  Everybody except him.
[01:56:31.807 --> 01:56:46.538]  And when he says I alone can fix it, that clearly demonstrates he doesn't understand how America works, how we got great and why we are great today and what we need to do together.
[01:56:48.038 --> 01:56:48.438]  To face
[01:57:06.343 --> 01:57:07.744]  Oh, she got through it, but she didn't.
[01:57:07.804 --> 01:57:10.105]  She started coughing right after it.
[01:57:10.125 --> 01:57:11.886]  Show a little peace.
[01:57:11.906 --> 01:57:12.487]  She got through it.
[01:57:12.507 --> 01:57:12.847]  She's tough.
[01:57:12.867 --> 01:57:14.408]  Now, let's go to the other feed being cut.
[01:57:14.428 --> 01:57:14.828]  This is 100% clear.
[01:57:14.848 --> 01:57:17.109]  They're saying, cut the feed, cut the feed.
[01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:21.832]  You get to listen carefully, but you can hear him arguing, saying, hey, I'd rather take a cut and pay and not cut the feed.
[01:57:34.161 --> 01:57:35.622]  You know, we're supposed to cover this.
[01:57:35.922 --> 01:57:36.663]  Let's go to the feed.
[01:57:39.144 --> 01:57:46.650]  When a woman who had the issue of blood said that I can only touch the gem of Jesus' garment, I was made whole.
[01:57:48.391 --> 01:57:50.993]  Nothing else could help her but the power of God.
[01:57:53.815 --> 01:57:56.977]  There's going to be some times in your life that you're going to feel forsaken.
[01:57:56.997 --> 01:57:59.339]  You're going to feel down.
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:02.561]  But the anointing is going to lift you up.
[01:58:05.603 --> 01:58:09.326]  I'm going to... I prayed over this personally.
[01:58:10.467 --> 01:58:11.768]  And I fasted over it.
[01:58:13.009 --> 01:58:28.042]  And I want to just put this on you right now.
[01:58:28.122 --> 01:58:32.046]  This is the Jewish Heritage Study Bible.
[01:58:33.624 --> 01:58:39.308]  And we have it especially for you, and we have it for your wife.
[01:58:39.609 --> 01:58:39.949]  Thank you.
[01:58:40.529 --> 01:58:46.173]  Because when things go down, you can study the Word of God.
[01:58:47.835 --> 01:58:53.779]  When things seem like it's... We're gonna come back and play the rest of it where they cut the feed, but you can hear them talking there, then they cut the feed.
[01:58:54.159 --> 01:58:54.740]  When ordered.
[01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:57.402]  Do not show this key interaction.
[01:58:59.406 --> 01:59:01.247]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:59:01.288 --> 01:59:03.169]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:59:03.329 --> 01:59:06.171]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:59:06.231 --> 01:59:12.096]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:59:12.296 --> 01:59:21.143]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[01:59:21.463 --> 01:59:28.712]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:59:29.012 --> 01:59:36.742]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:59:37.042 --> 01:59:38.004]  The general public doesn't.
[01:59:39.225 --> 01:59:41.526]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:59:43.167 --> 01:59:46.569]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:59:46.730 --> 01:59:53.193]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:59:53.434 --> 01:59:57.756]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:00:02.059 --> 02:00:04.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:20.819 --> 02:00:23.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:23.020 --> 02:00:38.748]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[02:00:41.749 --> 02:00:48.713]  Alright, so I was getting into this article that we posted in the video over the holiday
[02:00:50.675 --> 02:00:54.677]  Of Donald Trump in Detroit, Michigan, speaking at a black church.
[02:00:56.558 --> 02:01:07.303]  And when they got to the part of the anointing and the preacher up there talking with Trump, Thomson Reuters that runs video feeds all over the world that subscribers pay for, just says cut it.
[02:01:08.944 --> 02:01:12.446]  Or if you're wearing a Trump shirt when you're on TV, they blur that out.
[02:01:12.866 --> 02:01:13.807]  This is what they do.
[02:01:13.847 --> 02:01:18.669]  This is part of the order that's gone out for perception management.
[02:01:19.309 --> 02:01:20.150]  So let's finish that clip.
[02:01:23.064 --> 02:01:31.389]  When things seem like it's almost impossible, you will read Mark 9, 23, if thou canst believe.
[02:01:37.012 --> 02:01:39.194]  All things are possible.
[02:01:44.677 --> 02:01:45.297]  And there they are.
[02:01:45.517 --> 02:01:48.019]  They cut the feed.
[02:01:49.540 --> 02:01:49.860]  Right there.
[02:01:52.512 --> 02:01:53.373]  In everyone's face.
[02:01:55.374 --> 02:01:57.635]  They cut the feed.
[02:02:00.316 --> 02:02:06.580]  And they do this all the time now, when Trump says Hillary is working with ISIS and helped found them.
[02:02:06.700 --> 02:02:06.920]  Cut.
[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:09.521]  When he first said that, remember, they cut it on a bunch of different networks.
[02:02:10.102 --> 02:02:15.785]  Then they couldn't hide the fact that it was said, so then they tried to spin it and lie about it, but now they've been forced to basically admit it's true.
[02:02:17.086 --> 02:02:18.166]  This is how they deceive.
[02:02:18.506 --> 02:02:19.607]  This is how they manipulate.
[02:02:21.497 --> 02:02:23.798]  And they're doing it more and more.
[02:02:24.299 --> 02:02:27.901]  And it's not just censoring the videos themselves or censoring the feeds.
[02:02:29.262 --> 02:02:46.792]  Take things like Dr. Drew, who a week or so after, and I said five days because it came out that he had officially been told he was losing his job five days after, but technically eight days later it was announced that he lost his job.
[02:02:46.812 --> 02:02:48.013]  But why that matters, I don't know.
[02:02:48.053 --> 02:02:48.934]  I get into factoids.
[02:02:50.202 --> 02:02:57.367]  It's now been reported by the New York Post that indeed he was told to retract it and wouldn't do it, so he was removed.
[02:02:59.709 --> 02:03:02.651]  And if there was only one case of this, you could say, oh, well, it's not that bad.
[02:03:02.691 --> 02:03:11.257]  But they admit under Obama and under the leftist rule, we have seen censorship of the press in this country never before seen.
[02:03:11.277 --> 02:03:11.937]  It's un-American.
[02:03:11.977 --> 02:03:12.798]  It's anti-freedom.
[02:03:13.499 --> 02:03:15.140]  And just like Julian Assange said last week,
[02:03:16.052 --> 02:03:19.794]  In a New York Times interview, where's the instinct of the press for self-preservation?
[02:03:20.194 --> 02:03:21.095]  Why don't you stick together?
[02:03:21.155 --> 02:03:21.935]  What is your problem?
[02:03:22.295 --> 02:03:27.218]  This press climate is unbelievable.
[02:03:28.239 --> 02:03:39.264]  This press climate is one of the most out-of-control dangerous we have ever seen in the history of this country.
[02:03:40.465 --> 02:03:40.825]  And it is.
[02:03:40.885 --> 02:03:45.508]  So that's why every American has to use their First Amendment and to be as aggressive with it as you can.
[02:03:46.769 --> 02:03:58.480]  Whether it's a blog talk radio show, or a YouTube channel you have, or whether it's going in a local radio show, or an access show, or maybe you're a filmmaker that normally makes films on something else, make a political film.
[02:03:59.561 --> 02:04:01.222]  You're a cartoonist, now make it political.
[02:04:01.382 --> 02:04:12.633]  Everybody has to basically make art and make culture that counters the globalists, so people understand we're the majority, we're the common sense, we're not part of this system they're selling and they're pushing.
[02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:20.103]  And also that liberty lovers don't territorialize information.
[02:04:20.503 --> 02:04:21.384]  We're in a war.
[02:04:22.424 --> 02:04:30.890]  It is not about who said something first or who did something first or, you know, oh, somebody played my video club and didn't give me credit.
[02:04:31.271 --> 02:04:33.472]  It is about defeating the new world order.
[02:04:33.812 --> 02:04:38.736]  We're going to lose everything if we don't get together, get serious, get focused and take action.
[02:04:40.114 --> 02:04:45.076]  And I've been putting that message out for years, and it's good to see Breitbart, Daily Caller, WorldNetDaily, all of them getting it.
[02:04:46.116 --> 02:04:48.877]  And WorldNetDaily the first, about six, seven years ago, reaching out.
[02:04:49.438 --> 02:04:56.220]  Because I don't want to sit here and fight over, you know, who's the king daddy, you know, in the fight against the New World Order.
[02:04:57.021 --> 02:05:00.802]  You know, with Drudge up there as the big mothership, magnifying all our information.
[02:05:02.103 --> 02:05:03.483]  I want to defeat the New World Order.
[02:05:03.683 --> 02:05:04.904]  I want to be made obsolete.
[02:05:05.544 --> 02:05:07.365]  I want to sail off into the sunset, quite frankly.
[02:05:10.359 --> 02:05:15.845]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[02:05:16.386 --> 02:05:16.866]  Unveiled!
[02:05:17.287 --> 02:05:20.330]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula.
[02:05:21.031 --> 02:05:21.491]  30 servings.
[02:05:21.671 --> 02:05:24.274]  Fruit punch flavor dietary supplement.
[02:05:24.594 --> 02:05:25.656]  It is simply amazing.
[02:05:25.716 --> 02:05:26.657]  Infowarslife.com
[02:05:27.037 --> 02:05:31.458]  There's a million different products like this out there that they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[02:05:31.958 --> 02:05:45.062]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all the essential amino acids, all the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy gross stuff.
[02:05:45.422 --> 02:05:46.623]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[02:05:46.643 --> 02:05:47.863]  I put it in my protein shake.
[02:05:48.483 --> 02:05:53.987]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[02:05:54.007 --> 02:05:57.030]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[02:05:57.070 --> 02:05:59.291]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something this good.
[02:05:59.892 --> 02:06:06.057]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[02:06:06.257 --> 02:06:08.618]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[02:06:08.979 --> 02:06:10.860]  Okay, this is... Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:13.182]  Yeah, this... I wanna... but again, there's some great stuff out there.
[02:06:13.382 --> 02:06:15.244]  Yeah.
[02:06:15.264 --> 02:06:17.727]  And there's other powders I promote at Infowarshealth.com.
[02:06:17.747 --> 02:06:18.187]  They're excellent.
[02:06:18.868 --> 02:06:19.769]  There's some good stuff out there.
[02:06:19.909 --> 02:06:22.592]  This is just the very best we can bring you.
[02:06:22.632 --> 02:06:24.654]  And when you buy it, you support Infowars.
[02:06:24.914 --> 02:06:25.975]  You support the reporters.
[02:06:26.196 --> 02:06:26.956]  You support yourself.
[02:06:28.168 --> 02:06:47.757]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this and why this is just this total complete package for your body because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[02:06:48.277 --> 02:06:48.877]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:06:48.917 --> 02:06:52.078]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[02:06:52.158 --> 02:06:53.398]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[02:06:53.418 --> 02:06:54.259]  Tell folks about that.
[02:06:54.279 --> 02:06:56.919]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[02:06:57.820 --> 02:07:00.420]  As the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:07.362]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine, each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[02:07:07.782 --> 02:07:10.983]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[02:07:11.003 --> 02:07:12.524]  34 other ones you can check out.
[02:07:12.724 --> 02:07:14.564]  Go to infowarslife.com, the label's up there.
[02:07:15.084 --> 02:07:17.385]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[02:07:17.785 --> 02:07:19.746]  Neurotically examined for yourself.
[02:07:20.747 --> 02:07:25.189]  And just... By the way, look on the other side too, because we're showing people the minerals and things.
[02:07:25.229 --> 02:07:27.090]  Let's look at the vitamins right there, all it's got in there.
[02:07:27.110 --> 02:07:27.770]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:07:27.790 --> 02:07:28.291]  Top left.
[02:07:28.351 --> 02:07:31.693]  Again, if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:07:32.073 --> 02:07:35.094]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and... What's that other source?
[02:07:35.114 --> 02:07:38.036]  I just show this to all the best sources.
[02:07:40.245 --> 02:07:40.665]  Retinol.
[02:07:40.685 --> 02:07:45.168]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[02:07:45.508 --> 02:07:45.889]  And you know what?
[02:07:45.989 --> 02:07:48.130]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[02:07:48.370 --> 02:07:48.970]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[02:07:48.990 --> 02:07:55.995]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[02:07:56.315 --> 02:08:01.878]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[02:08:02.359 --> 02:08:03.199]  So get them today.
[02:08:03.279 --> 02:08:05.341]  Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:19.895 --> 02:08:23.837]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:24.257 --> 02:08:26.599]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:33.543 --> 02:08:36.564]  There is undoubtedly a move to set up a planetary government.
[02:08:37.205 --> 02:08:41.187]  Globalism was set up after World War II and sold to academics.
[02:08:42.825 --> 02:08:49.410]  As a plan to use the West's wealth to build up a third world and create a planet of peace.
[02:08:50.270 --> 02:08:57.596]  We were told that the State Department Memorandum 7277 and the different public laws for us to disarm would be part of some new utopia.
[02:08:59.057 --> 02:09:08.884]  The truth is, under globalism, special interests have used it to cheat and to create a crony capitalist system that has made the West poor and the third world even more dangerous.
[02:09:10.199 --> 02:09:14.185]  So now we're told we see a system where globalism is crisis management.
[02:09:15.727 --> 02:09:21.034]  And the controllers only want to make more crises because they then pose as the saviors.
[02:09:22.276 --> 02:09:24.319]  This is 21st century warfare.
[02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:26.882]  But once you're aware of this form of warfare,
[02:09:28.632 --> 02:09:32.213]  It's not effective anymore because the people are aware of what's happening.
[02:09:32.733 --> 02:09:41.456]  Now, we've got Obama getting off in China, being snubbed at the back of the plane, Chinese officials yammering and yelling, this is our country, our airport, in their face, unprecedented.
[02:09:41.896 --> 02:09:49.418]  You've got Hillary having giant coughing fits, then at her press conference having coughing fits, then saying it's a conspiracy theory, having to stop because of coughing fits.
[02:09:50.765 --> 02:09:51.986]  Is that congestive heart failure?
[02:09:52.026 --> 02:09:53.506]  I mean, what on earth is going on here?
[02:09:54.307 --> 02:09:59.489]  Dr. Drew, it's now been confirmed, was threatened and basically told to retract, but he wouldn't.
[02:10:00.189 --> 02:10:07.972]  We have Russia and Saudi Arabia coming out saying that they're going to start freezing oil production.
[02:10:08.393 --> 02:10:09.993]  That's made oil prices go back up.
[02:10:10.473 --> 02:10:11.434]  What does all this mean?
[02:10:11.454 --> 02:10:16.216]  Now, I don't normally have Dr. Pachinko on, maybe once a month, really smart guy, but things are so hot and heavy.
[02:10:16.256 --> 02:10:18.317]  I had him on last week.
[02:10:19.690 --> 02:10:23.911]  So I thought we'd have him pop back in because we ran out of time to talk about de-evolution.
[02:10:23.951 --> 02:10:26.751]  Now, people think of that as like going back to horse and buggies.
[02:10:26.791 --> 02:10:31.792]  No, it means taking the power back from the central government, back to locales, back to the people.
[02:10:32.272 --> 02:10:33.313]  We've seen this with Brexit.
[02:10:33.353 --> 02:10:37.733]  We see this with the situation with the Catalonians there in Spain.
[02:10:38.954 --> 02:10:45.435]  We see this all over the world where these artificial structures that were set up by colonialism are falling apart.
[02:10:46.115 --> 02:10:56.045]  But here it means Washington and other areas run by socialists falling apart, people running to areas that the Global Stone Control and Prosperity then taking place.
[02:10:56.065 --> 02:11:03.172]  The problem is then, like Locust, unconsciously the parasites and their controllers move to the next area where we fled to.
[02:11:03.752 --> 02:11:07.155]  So I wanted to speak to this, but since he was on with us last week so much,
[02:11:08.218 --> 02:11:09.039]  Has already come out.
[02:11:09.119 --> 02:11:12.322]  So much has happened with more leaks, more information.
[02:11:12.362 --> 02:11:14.444]  Hillary being followed around by ambulances.
[02:11:14.945 --> 02:11:21.050]  Hillary being photographed coming out of black SUVs with the whole back lowers down with a wheelchair.
[02:11:21.070 --> 02:11:25.995]  I mean clearly she's degenerating fast where she can't even give a speech once a week.
[02:11:26.456 --> 02:11:28.417]  We're going to talk about all this and more.
[02:11:28.437 --> 02:11:31.981]  The attempt to hand the internet over to this multinational consortium.
[02:11:33.922 --> 02:11:35.143]  Big things are afoot.
[02:11:35.683 --> 02:11:37.964]  Big agreements are afoot.
[02:11:38.324 --> 02:11:39.685]  Major shifts are happening.
[02:11:41.425 --> 02:11:46.908]  The good news is, and I'm not, again, lionizing them, but people are always saying, well, where's the military?
[02:11:46.928 --> 02:11:48.029]  Where are the police in all this?
[02:11:48.809 --> 02:11:52.290]  But when you have open corruption, Hillary, and the emails and all the rest of it, nobody gets in trouble.
[02:11:52.791 --> 02:11:53.571]  It sends a message.
[02:11:53.611 --> 02:11:54.972]  And you have George Soros trying to start
[02:11:55.936 --> 02:11:59.141]  The destabilization campaign against local governments to then bring the UN in.
[02:11:59.662 --> 02:12:02.707]  And now they're announcing the Justice Department to run the elections.
[02:12:02.767 --> 02:12:04.911]  This is really waking people up.
[02:12:04.951 --> 02:12:08.577]  And you see the symbol of the rotting facade of the establishment.
[02:12:09.932 --> 02:12:31.637]  Of these multinational interests that are taking control of our country, the arrogance to have Hillary foisted this corpse, shoved in front of us, I think, as I've said many times this month, is emblematic of a so-called elite that is out of touch, to the point of Chinese officials arrogantly screaming, you're nothing, this is our country, our airport.
[02:12:32.337 --> 02:12:34.077]  I mean, this is disintegration.
[02:12:34.418 --> 02:12:36.118]  Obama, four to five months,
[02:12:37.495 --> 02:12:38.596]  A year on vacation.
[02:12:39.276 --> 02:12:41.058]  Refusing to go to Louisiana.
[02:12:41.658 --> 02:12:42.999]  Just the total disconnect.
[02:12:43.500 --> 02:12:45.922]  Is this the Marie Antoinette moment?
[02:12:46.382 --> 02:12:48.484]  Is the power structure crashing and burning?
[02:12:48.924 --> 02:12:50.986]  And where do we go at the end of this?
[02:12:51.026 --> 02:12:51.666]  Dr. Puccini?
[02:12:53.268 --> 02:12:58.772]  Alex, it's always a pleasure, but I think the key word that you used was Marie Antoinette.
[02:12:58.892 --> 02:13:03.035]  And let me give you and the audience a very clear idea of what we're talking about.
[02:13:03.636 --> 02:13:06.358]  In a liberal newspaper, the New York Times,
[02:13:07.054 --> 02:13:11.857]  Which often criticizes us, but sometimes offers very interesting information.
[02:13:12.597 --> 02:13:18.861]  They wrote about the fact that she is making over $156,000 per hour.
[02:13:18.881 --> 02:13:28.827]  Let me repeat it again, $156,000 per hour for the rich and the very rich and the very famous.
[02:13:29.147 --> 02:13:36.071]  She's sequestered away in Martha's Vineyards in the Hamptons and Beverly Hills, will not talk to anybody.
[02:13:36.691 --> 02:13:47.475]  And make sure that if you take a picture with her, and you're a child that costs $2,000, if you bring your family along with you, and you want a group picture with Hillary, that's $10,000.
[02:13:47.955 --> 02:13:55.898]  But literally she makes $156,000 per hour taking pictures with her, not doing anything, not creating anything.
[02:13:56.318 --> 02:14:01.121]  Not implementing a program or even being able to articulate a policy.
[02:14:01.181 --> 02:14:08.946]  So what we have here is literally the beginning of the end of the Marie Antoinette school of government.
[02:14:09.126 --> 02:14:10.086]  She is finished.
[02:14:10.526 --> 02:14:21.233]  She understands that and in fact has a woman who intercedes for her by the name, and it's the most ludicrous thing I've ever seen, but it epitomizes
[02:14:22.714 --> 02:14:27.556]  The absurdity of how Hillary is so alien from us.
[02:14:27.776 --> 02:14:33.179]  The lady who intervenes on behalf of Hillary Clinton is Lady Lynn Forrester, the Rothschild.
[02:14:33.779 --> 02:14:48.687]  A friend who makes sure that nobody asks Hillary any hard questions, does not get in a confrontation, and makes sure that everybody pays $100,000 per couple at a lamb dinner in a Martha's Vineyard.
[02:14:49.507 --> 02:14:51.228]  She's married to a Rothschild!
[02:15:07.321 --> 02:15:11.482]  Yeah, she's not even a Rothschild, but the Rothschilds aren't even Rothschilds.
[02:15:11.522 --> 02:15:20.785]  So the point of fact is what Alex is saying is the system is breaking down because a Rothschild is totally irrelevant to this country.
[02:15:21.345 --> 02:15:28.807]  A Rothschild was nothing more than a family of Shylocks who loaned out money in the 14th century in Frankfurt, Germany.
[02:15:29.307 --> 02:15:31.129]  And became some nobility.
[02:15:31.209 --> 02:15:32.611]  They didn't create anything.
[02:15:32.651 --> 02:15:38.317]  They didn't invest or create any new medicines or any great works of art.
[02:15:38.738 --> 02:15:43.884]  So what you have here is the ultimate corruption of the elite.
[02:15:44.384 --> 02:15:49.126]  Including the sources, including the Bon Jovies, including the Hollywood elite.
[02:15:49.546 --> 02:16:04.171]  And what's happening is even the liberal people like the New York Times has to show you that the contrast between what the people are talking about, the Hillary Clintons and all the liberals, and how they live wearing $10,000
[02:16:05.991 --> 02:16:06.612]  I think?
[02:16:28.012 --> 02:16:43.659]  One of the things that came in, Alex, and what we were talking about, that when Hillary gets in, if she gets in because she's so incapacitated, physically and mentally, Dr. Drew agreed with that, and many other internists agree with that, we have Mr. Tim Kaine.
[02:16:44.159 --> 02:16:53.343]  Now, I purposely left out one element of Tim Kaine when I said that he was, in fact, a CIA Jesuit operative with Negro Ponte.
[02:16:53.863 --> 02:17:08.038]  The New York Times came back on an article, didn't address me, but it was addressed to me and Alex, saying he was not a CIA operative, which was absurd, but instead they explained how he was part of liberation theology.
[02:17:08.478 --> 02:17:10.781]  Now to show you... That's code word for Ford Foundation!
[02:17:12.077 --> 02:17:13.519]  Well, it's even worse than that.
[02:17:13.539 --> 02:17:20.809]  The liberation theology, and they didn't realize that, neither did Tim Kaine, is about communism.
[02:17:21.290 --> 02:17:23.753]  It's about the Jesuits who practice
[02:17:24.420 --> 02:17:25.361]  We're good to go.
[02:17:43.300 --> 02:17:44.901]  This gentleman, Tim Kaine.
[02:17:45.021 --> 02:17:59.529]  So what we have is not only the church falling apart, the Rothschilds falling apart, the Hillary Clintons falling apart, the entire establishment, the Secret Service not really able to do what they're supposed to, the FBI.
[02:18:00.249 --> 02:18:02.670]  Totally emasculated.
[02:18:03.111 --> 02:18:04.952]  And we have there for the devolution of power.
[02:18:05.132 --> 02:18:20.420]  And you have Hillary, have you seen the photos of the press when she did this one press conference that wasn't a press conference, the first in over 170 days, with about a dozen women and two men looking at her like she is Jesus coming down from heaven at Mount Olives.
[02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:27.583]  I mean, when you look at the way and the videos of how they've fallen after her, it is such a sick joke.
[02:18:27.643 --> 02:18:28.744]  I mean, what is going on here?
[02:18:29.602 --> 02:18:38.646]  Well, what's going on is the fact, you know Alex, we've seen this before with the Bush administration and Bill Clinton and the Obama administration.
[02:18:38.686 --> 02:18:41.387]  What happens is the minute they became president,
[02:18:42.108 --> 02:18:44.409]  They immediately isolate themselves off.
[02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:47.271]  And I've got to go back again to the Secret Service.
[02:18:47.711 --> 02:18:50.493]  The Secret Service has not served America.
[02:18:50.953 --> 02:19:03.881]  They have served a President of the United States and creates, by their definition of their jobs, this isolated notion of a precious individual who can't be assassinated.
[02:19:04.001 --> 02:19:06.142]  Now, I'm not advocating assassination.
[02:19:06.182 --> 02:19:09.484]  I'm just simply stating the fact that no person
[02:19:09.764 --> 02:19:10.224]  No, I get it.
[02:19:10.264 --> 02:19:16.407]  I mean, they're totally like Chinese princesses with their feet bound in an ivory tower in La La Land, disconnected.
[02:19:16.447 --> 02:19:19.569]  But at the same time, they're working on our dollar.
[02:19:19.809 --> 02:19:21.690]  It's our tax dollars that pay.
[02:19:21.710 --> 02:19:23.351]  So they're not servants, they become emperors.
[02:19:23.371 --> 02:19:24.372]  So let me ask you this question.
[02:19:24.392 --> 02:19:25.332]  Yes, sir.
[02:19:25.492 --> 02:19:28.854]  Looking at this, how far can it go?
[02:19:28.914 --> 02:19:30.535]  Because my historical gut
[02:19:31.297 --> 02:19:31.477]  Just
[02:19:50.057 --> 02:20:01.725]  Other countries are treating, not so much our military or our people, but treating Obama, making him get off the back of the plane, getting in their face yesterday, not having a red carpet.
[02:20:01.745 --> 02:20:03.066]  What does that signify by the Chinese?
[02:20:03.086 --> 02:20:05.648]  Well, it's a little bit worse than that, my friend.
[02:20:05.908 --> 02:20:14.254]  If anybody recalls, the president of the Philippines, to a dead date, just called Obama the son of a whore.
[02:20:14.434 --> 02:20:16.176]  He said his mother is a whore, which is actually true.
[02:20:17.054 --> 02:20:21.038]  Well, irrespective of the reality... Well, it just shows how informed he is.
[02:20:21.078 --> 02:20:24.000]  His mother was in pornography with the communist publisher.
[02:20:24.020 --> 02:20:24.881]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:20:24.901 --> 02:20:25.461]  But go ahead.
[02:20:26.042 --> 02:20:26.302]  No, no, no.
[02:20:26.382 --> 02:20:36.191]  But what the point is, I could not imagine that the president of the Philippines would ever mention that or say anything to Putin.
[02:20:36.952 --> 02:20:38.572]  To President of China.
[02:20:38.953 --> 02:20:54.177]  So what has happened is we've created this isolated, weak individual, which will continue with Hillary, who cannot stand up for anything, cannot assert the position of America, and really does not represent the United States.
[02:20:54.197 --> 02:20:54.857]  I agree.
[02:20:54.897 --> 02:20:55.637]  Let's go back though.
[02:20:55.657 --> 02:20:57.517]  I mean, the Philippines is a big ally of the U.S.
[02:20:57.557 --> 02:20:59.678]  They know that China is being allowed to walk around in there.
[02:20:59.698 --> 02:21:01.118]  Our military doesn't like it.
[02:21:01.138 --> 02:21:03.039]  I mean, why would he make that provocation?
[02:21:03.823 --> 02:21:10.406]  Because he doesn't give a damn about Obama, but there's this more serious problem, and I'll tell you what it is.
[02:21:10.466 --> 02:21:17.029]  When I was Deputy Assistant Secretary of East Asia under the Baker administration, I had to deal with the Filipinos.
[02:21:17.709 --> 02:21:32.095]  And I noticed that when I came into their Prime Minister and their offices, they would sit there in a very arrogant way and kind of treat me in a very patronizing way, although I was technically over their country.
[02:21:32.917 --> 02:21:44.928]  But what I knew, and they did not know, is that I had their visa applications because every one of the leaders of the Philippines, including Marcos Aquino, had American citizenship or American visas.
[02:21:45.409 --> 02:21:53.937]  So when this individual started to shoot his mouth off about our presence in the Philippines, I cut him off immediately and I said, you know what?
[02:21:54.377 --> 02:21:55.138]  Your visa's up.
[02:21:55.718 --> 02:21:58.060]  And I will explain something to you very quickly.
[02:21:58.160 --> 02:22:00.001]  You keep, you shut your mouth.
[02:22:00.481 --> 02:22:02.262]  You say what we're going to tell you.
[02:22:02.302 --> 02:22:04.764]  You're going to nod your head when I tell you what we're going to do.
[02:22:05.204 --> 02:22:07.146]  We will give you half a billion dollars.
[02:22:07.186 --> 02:22:08.286]  That was my instructions.
[02:22:08.386 --> 02:22:10.608]  And we're leaving your base in the Subic Bay.
[02:22:11.028 --> 02:22:12.269]  And we're going to Singapore.
[02:22:12.289 --> 02:22:13.230]  Do you understand that?
[02:22:13.590 --> 02:22:16.212]  And if you don't, I'm going to withdraw your visa.
[02:22:16.272 --> 02:22:16.672]  That was it.
[02:22:17.759 --> 02:22:22.024]  And handling him that way, he shut his mouth, he kept quiet.
[02:22:22.064 --> 02:22:26.369]  Sure, so it's just classic male bravado, and Trump understands that.
[02:22:26.629 --> 02:22:31.875]  You look at somebody like Obama who bows and kisses everybody's ass, doesn't he get that's the exact wrong message?
[02:22:32.884 --> 02:22:42.410]  No, because, once again, Alex, one of the things we haven't talked about is when you're a weak individual, what do you pick as your coterie of advisors?
[02:22:42.450 --> 02:22:43.851]  There's all sick offense.
[02:22:43.951 --> 02:22:48.153]  Hillary has one of the worst group of advisors I've ever seen.
[02:22:48.213 --> 02:22:56.578]  The continuity of the Sandy Burgers, the Susan Rices, they come out of think tanks, they're totally inept in what they do.
[02:22:56.598 --> 02:22:58.680]  So they're little office weasels that just sit around.
[02:22:58.700 --> 02:22:59.600]  Nothing more than a speech writer.
[02:22:59.620 --> 02:23:02.262]  So they just sit around all day at lunch telling each other how smart they are.
[02:23:03.035 --> 02:23:04.096]  Well, it's not only that.
[02:23:04.296 --> 02:23:12.261]  It's a problem for us because we have to be able, the American public has to be able to vet out all of these people, including for Trump.
[02:23:12.481 --> 02:23:16.184]  I have to tell you exactly what I said last time about Manafort.
[02:23:16.624 --> 02:23:18.945]  Christie has to leave the Trump campaign.
[02:23:21.547 --> 02:23:22.068]  I don't know.
[02:23:36.661 --> 02:23:37.381]  Chipmunk into your operation.
[02:23:37.401 --> 02:24:04.728]  What I'm saying also is that I'm warning the Trump and the Hillary campaign on your show that they should not be getting advice from neocons like Steve Hadley and Zalmay Khalilzad because the people on this show and the millions of Americans who fought against the Bush and Clinton administration are watching again seeing Steve Hadley, Wolfowitz, Zalmay Khalilzad, all the neocons who created 9-11 and created the war in Iraq
[02:24:05.308 --> 02:24:09.571]  Being questioned and being offered positions in the government.
[02:24:09.871 --> 02:24:18.956]  If that occurs, I will say it categorically, the Secret Service, the FBI, and many other institutions will have very serious problems.
[02:24:19.748 --> 02:24:27.713]  Very serious problems if the Bush people come back in any shape or form, either under Hillary or under Trump.
[02:24:27.753 --> 02:24:34.077]  So under the soft coup being orchestrated by patriots in the country, just their information war, the Bush and the Clintons are out.
[02:24:34.457 --> 02:24:36.318]  We're going to have fair policy for the U.S.
[02:24:36.358 --> 02:24:42.782]  We're not breaking the United States for globalism as some sacrificial lamb to impress the Chinese or anybody else.
[02:24:43.923 --> 02:24:45.784]  So let's talk about how we make sure that happens.
[02:24:46.601 --> 02:24:56.235]  Well, one of the ways it happens is we at the local level, for example in Florida, we support a man called Ted Yoho, a veterinarian, came out of what's called the Tea Party here.
[02:24:56.275 --> 02:24:57.977]  Now this is a microcosm example.
[02:24:58.017 --> 02:25:02.965]  Explain how we accelerate the patriot liberty takeover of the states.
[02:25:03.646 --> 02:25:13.576]  The way we do that is to make sure we pinpoint our local candidates who support, one, our national security at the national level and at the local level.
[02:25:14.116 --> 02:25:18.921]  Secondly, we want to make sure that these individuals are not beholden to big business in any way.
[02:25:19.847 --> 02:25:26.694]  Thirdly, we want to make sure that they have values that are consistent with this country as a Judeo-Christian entity.
[02:25:27.394 --> 02:25:33.660]  And fourthly, and fifthly, they're people who will respond to you when you write to them or tweet to them.
[02:25:34.020 --> 02:25:40.727]  I give you an example of Ted Yoho, who's a local veterinarian, decided to run for Congress, had never been in politics.
[02:25:41.347 --> 02:25:53.611]  And you're saying so you can organize them, you can inform them, and you can use them to organize even more by getting involved in promising campaigns?
[02:25:53.851 --> 02:25:55.651]  Twitter at stevepachinik.com.
[02:25:55.991 --> 02:25:57.592]  We should point out that Dr. Pachinik
[02:25:57.972 --> 02:25:58.352]  Thank you, Al.
[02:26:24.312 --> 02:26:26.293]  Please continue talking about what de-evolution is.
[02:26:26.513 --> 02:26:28.793]  Because you predicted it here like five years ago, and it's happening.
[02:26:29.554 --> 02:26:45.299]  Well, it's happening very quickly because our tax dollars can no longer afford the price of Obama going from the golf courses of Martha's Vineyard and right into China, where he really doesn't need to go to an ASEAN meeting.
[02:26:45.439 --> 02:26:46.679]  I've been in an ASEAN meeting.
[02:26:46.719 --> 02:26:47.819]  They're a waste of time.
[02:26:48.260 --> 02:26:49.880]  And it cost us $186,000 per hour for one of his planes.
[02:26:53.181 --> 02:26:56.305]  And you double that because he's got two to three planes going.
[02:26:56.766 --> 02:27:01.231]  Number two, you get involved at the state and local levels and commissioners.
[02:27:01.692 --> 02:27:02.513]  I mean, literally.
[02:27:03.013 --> 02:27:04.535]  And you go for the candidate.
[02:27:05.056 --> 02:27:12.405]  If the candidate doesn't have a party, or it's a libertarian party, or even a democratic party, you make sure that candidate responds to you.
[02:27:12.945 --> 02:27:21.412]  And you work for that candidate at the local level, and organize your friends and neighbors to make sure that we have people who can respond.
[02:27:21.432 --> 02:27:24.775]  That's right, you just don't vote, you infiltrate the political process.
[02:27:24.795 --> 02:27:25.155]  Correct.
[02:27:25.475 --> 02:27:28.738]  This is a whole new revolution, Alex, and you're absolutely right.
[02:27:29.138 --> 02:27:31.780]  You've articulated it in a way we've never had it before.
[02:27:31.840 --> 02:27:39.026]  Because of Twitter, because of the internet, we're able to now sustain a dialogue with our local representatives
[02:27:39.606 --> 02:27:40.367]  Back them up.
[02:27:40.827 --> 02:27:43.129]  Work with them for free if it's voluntary.
[02:27:43.169 --> 02:27:45.290]  If you have a few dollars, you give it to them.
[02:27:45.710 --> 02:27:48.252]  The national level now is not as relevant.
[02:27:48.612 --> 02:27:52.755]  And the reason for that is that we're devolving power to the state level.
[02:27:52.955 --> 02:27:54.856]  The governor's becoming more powerful.
[02:27:55.177 --> 02:27:57.998]  The county commissioner's becoming even more powerful.
[02:27:58.299 --> 02:28:00.080]  Your judges, your tax collectors...
[02:28:09.729 --> 02:28:11.322]  It'll be a bloodless revolution, game over!
[02:28:12.079 --> 02:28:12.599]  You got it.
[02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:14.460]  Alex just hit it on the head.
[02:28:14.661 --> 02:28:18.143]  What relevance does the FBI really have to the local community?
[02:28:18.403 --> 02:28:18.663]  None.
[02:28:18.923 --> 02:28:19.443]  Zippo.
[02:28:19.543 --> 02:28:19.964]  Zero.
[02:28:20.224 --> 02:28:25.687]  They can't even indict someone on the federal level other than somebody on pornography.
[02:28:26.327 --> 02:28:32.871]  Not on drugs, nothing on the Secret Service, nothing Department of Justice, nothing Department of Education.
[02:28:33.291 --> 02:28:35.052]  In other words, we just ignore them.
[02:28:35.432 --> 02:28:41.316]  Whether it's financially with the IRS, and we stop playing and lower our tax bases,
[02:28:41.836 --> 02:28:44.977]  Well, let me tell you what happened.
[02:29:06.304 --> 02:29:09.405]  I think you hit on something that's very important.
[02:29:09.485 --> 02:29:16.728]  When 9-11 occurred, a couple of the CIA operatives and others came up to me to literally apologize and excuse themselves.
[02:29:16.828 --> 02:29:20.509]  And the one question I had is, was your pension that important?
[02:29:20.942 --> 02:29:27.565]  That you could allow people to be killed, and American people to be killed, and they looked at me with shame.
[02:29:27.685 --> 02:29:32.208]  And the problem is, Alex, and this is what we have to reconstitute the federal government.
[02:29:32.348 --> 02:29:33.969]  No more pensions for 20 years.
[02:29:34.489 --> 02:29:34.809]  No one.
[02:29:35.269 --> 02:29:37.030]  Neither the military... Let's talk about that.
[02:29:37.050 --> 02:29:39.271]  We talked about that Friday, but here's my deal.
[02:29:39.691 --> 02:29:40.332]  Again, I'm not lying.
[02:29:40.352 --> 02:29:40.852]  I was in the FBI.
[02:29:40.892 --> 02:29:41.712]  I've been a big critic.
[02:29:42.213 --> 02:29:44.754]  It was the FBI that mainly exposed 9-11, actually, when it happened.
[02:29:45.054 --> 02:29:45.995]  Not really.
[02:29:46.355 --> 02:29:47.576]  A lot of them were involved.
[02:30:09.335 --> 02:30:13.739]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[02:30:13.819 --> 02:30:24.769]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:30:24.929 --> 02:30:29.851]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:30:29.971 --> 02:30:32.472]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[02:30:32.552 --> 02:30:34.032]  It helps detoxify.
[02:30:34.252 --> 02:30:37.074]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:30:37.154 --> 02:30:41.895]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[02:30:41.915 --> 02:30:48.138]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[02:30:48.158 --> 02:30:53.480]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:30:53.500 --> 02:30:54.260]  I'm taking it now.
[02:30:54.500 --> 02:30:55.021]  Every day.
[02:30:55.221 --> 02:30:55.962]  This is so key.
[02:30:56.202 --> 02:30:58.525]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[02:30:58.765 --> 02:31:00.507]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[02:31:00.527 --> 02:31:02.629]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[02:31:02.769 --> 02:31:06.233]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:31:09.497 --> 02:31:10.859]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:31:11.139 --> 02:31:12.421]  You can't survive without it.
[02:31:12.641 --> 02:31:13.523]  But where do you get it?
[02:31:13.843 --> 02:31:19.611]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:31:19.832 --> 02:31:25.560]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:31:25.720 --> 02:31:42.587]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[02:31:42.987 --> 02:31:45.108]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[02:31:45.468 --> 02:31:46.668]  Stainless steel construction.
[02:31:46.948 --> 02:31:47.649]  Easy assembly.
[02:31:47.989 --> 02:31:48.609]  Low maintenance.
[02:31:48.889 --> 02:31:50.710]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[02:32:09.156 --> 02:32:11.198]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[02:32:11.218 --> 02:32:13.381]  Does Hillary Clinton have Parkinson's disease?
[02:32:13.501 --> 02:32:16.344]  We can all see that she has some very serious health problems.
[02:32:16.464 --> 02:32:18.086]  Article up by Michael Snyder.
[02:32:18.226 --> 02:32:25.133]  It has been my contention for a long time that Hillary Clinton would do or say just about anything in order to become the first woman president.
[02:32:25.313 --> 02:32:29.955]  But would she actually lie to the American people about her health in order to reach that historic achievement?
[02:32:30.075 --> 02:32:36.137]  In recent days, the Clinton campaign has assured us over and over again about how healthy Hillary is.
[02:32:36.317 --> 02:32:41.699]  And she even opened up a jar of pickles for Jimmy Kimmel in order to prove how vigorous she is at her age.
[02:32:41.819 --> 02:32:44.760]  But we can all see that she has some very serious health problems.
[02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.201]  On Labor Day, Clinton had another one of her epic
[02:32:47.261 --> 02:32:47.982]  Intruder alert!
[02:32:48.002 --> 02:32:48.382]  Evacuate!
[02:33:26.393 --> 02:33:30.337]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:30.357 --> 02:33:36.242]  These people are coming for everybody!
[02:33:39.195 --> 02:33:41.016]  Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Steve Petchenik is our guest.
[02:33:41.036 --> 02:33:43.338]  We're going back to him here in just one moment.
[02:33:44.099 --> 02:33:52.025]  Again, conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly died yesterday at 92, and she'd even written a column about Trump being like Reagan.
[02:33:53.366 --> 02:33:55.748]  Her last column she'd written the day she died.
[02:33:55.768 --> 02:33:59.310]  We're going to air this week the interview we did with her about a month ago.
[02:33:59.330 --> 02:34:07.657]  Ted Cruz and folks tried to take over her operation with her daughter, but she handed it over to her son.
[02:34:09.145 --> 02:34:12.329]  Twitter users mocked Phyllis Schlafly's dying, celebrated her death.
[02:34:12.369 --> 02:34:13.650]  That's on Infowars.com.
[02:34:14.431 --> 02:34:18.595]  But her last article was, Trump in Mexico recalls Reagan in Geneva.
[02:34:19.816 --> 02:34:24.181]  And just how it was real political detente.
[02:34:24.961 --> 02:34:25.962]  And bringing people together.
[02:34:26.683 --> 02:34:30.087]  And a win-win around nationalism, not globalism.
[02:34:31.681 --> 02:34:34.202]  I want to talk to Dr. Pachinko about the failure of globalism.
[02:34:34.262 --> 02:34:35.202]  It was designed to fail.
[02:34:35.423 --> 02:34:38.364]  They promised all this kumbaya, that'd be great, but that's not what it was.
[02:34:38.404 --> 02:34:39.304]  They use it to cheat people.
[02:34:40.345 --> 02:34:41.665]  They use it to position themselves.
[02:34:43.386 --> 02:34:46.967]  And they have no sense because if you screw everyone over, then there's not a nice place to even be rich.
[02:34:48.308 --> 02:34:50.989]  Then you're ruling things from some third world hell.
[02:34:51.289 --> 02:34:52.510]  You've got a castle on the hill.
[02:34:53.070 --> 02:34:59.613]  But that shows you the different mindsets of these control freaks, those of which would dominate and control us versus those of which
[02:35:01.311 --> 02:35:02.352]  Wish to live in freedom.
[02:35:03.132 --> 02:35:06.234]  Before I go any further, we fund our operations self-funding.
[02:35:06.254 --> 02:35:07.715]  A lot of the media is going to this model now.
[02:35:08.616 --> 02:35:15.341]  We've done it because we can get the sponsors to fund the operation, but it takes too much time and too much energy that we can be focusing on information war.
[02:35:15.881 --> 02:35:22.145]  And instead, we can simply go out and get great products that we use, that we like, try to have the lowest prices out there.
[02:35:22.165 --> 02:35:22.946]  A lot of times we do.
[02:35:23.326 --> 02:35:24.087]  Always competitive.
[02:35:24.587 --> 02:35:26.008]  And then let folks know that it's a win-win.
[02:35:26.028 --> 02:35:28.650]  You buy these products you need that are high quality, it funds our operation.
[02:35:28.870 --> 02:35:30.271]  We have the widest selection out there.
[02:35:30.831 --> 02:35:33.252]  Of non-GMO, open-pollinated heirloom seeds.
[02:35:34.613 --> 02:35:35.293]  A great gift.
[02:35:35.833 --> 02:35:36.834]  Great to plant a garden.
[02:35:37.154 --> 02:35:37.574]  Whatever.
[02:35:38.014 --> 02:35:39.034]  It funds the operation.
[02:35:39.195 --> 02:35:39.755]  A win-win.
[02:35:40.975 --> 02:35:42.416]  I'm all about self-replicating.
[02:35:42.456 --> 02:35:44.997]  I'm all about 360 wins.
[02:35:45.057 --> 02:35:46.978]  I'm all about what helps you, what helps us.
[02:35:48.561 --> 02:35:50.542]  We're running a special that we rarely run.
[02:35:51.403 --> 02:35:58.326]  30 to 40% off all InfoWars storable food from the line InfoWars Select at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:35:58.507 --> 02:36:00.568]  Very same food as My Patriot Supply.
[02:36:00.608 --> 02:36:01.888]  We sell it right next to it at the store.
[02:36:02.229 --> 02:36:04.190]  Drop ship from the very same factory in Utah.
[02:36:04.850 --> 02:36:06.111]  Huge discount right now.
[02:36:06.671 --> 02:36:08.992]  With all the inflation and all the garbage going on.
[02:36:09.332 --> 02:36:10.372]  With all the manipulation.
[02:36:10.432 --> 02:36:11.553]  It's good to have storable food.
[02:36:11.593 --> 02:36:12.513]  It's good to have firearms.
[02:36:12.893 --> 02:36:14.034]  It's good to have water filtration.
[02:36:14.754 --> 02:36:16.255]  20% off water filtration systems.
[02:36:16.555 --> 02:36:18.296]  20% off Alexa Pure air filters.
[02:36:18.996 --> 02:36:20.496]  20% off the true good halogen.
[02:36:20.897 --> 02:36:22.097]  Nascent Iodine X2.
[02:36:22.917 --> 02:36:23.818]  And so much more.
[02:36:25.367 --> 02:36:30.491]  And then we also have things like the Hillary for President shirt that we're selling at cost.
[02:36:30.511 --> 02:36:35.374]  $9.95, shipping is included for a limited time at infowarestore.com.
[02:36:35.714 --> 02:36:39.397]  And just that meme alone is one of the top searched items on the internet.
[02:36:40.358 --> 02:36:44.941]  We look at Hillary and the photos of her wheelchair truck that she gets out of.
[02:36:44.981 --> 02:36:46.662]  I mean, this is all coming out.
[02:36:46.762 --> 02:36:51.526]  We just point out what people should look for, then the independent press goes out and does it.
[02:36:52.998 --> 02:36:54.600]  And then the globalists are in deep trouble.
[02:36:54.620 --> 02:36:57.843]  So I want to move quick on the 10 minutes we have left with Dr. Steve Pachetnik.
[02:36:58.404 --> 02:37:02.888]  Twitter at Steve Pachetnik or you just go to stevepachetnik.com, find his books and more.
[02:37:03.208 --> 02:37:07.252]  Doc, asking you just to overall give us some quick answers on some subjects here.
[02:37:07.272 --> 02:37:08.854]  I know you have a lot of sources.
[02:37:08.874 --> 02:37:12.457]  I don't know if you have talked to them on this subject.
[02:37:13.487 --> 02:37:14.889]  Or is it just your own research?
[02:37:15.370 --> 02:37:21.238]  When you were on with us, I don't know, three, four weeks ago, and you said she needs to have an independent group of medical examiners, neurologists look at her.
[02:37:21.558 --> 02:37:24.722]  That word for word has been said by Obama's former doctor last week.
[02:37:25.163 --> 02:37:26.925]  It's been said by Dr. Drew two weeks ago.
[02:37:26.945 --> 02:37:28.407]  I think he was fired less than a week later.
[02:37:29.148 --> 02:37:36.731]  It's been said by now scores of doctors are coming out after they fired Dr. Drew and saying, look, this is dangerous.
[02:37:36.771 --> 02:37:43.673]  We should be allowed to go on the radio and say that, you know, armor thyroid and humidant and rat poison don't mix well.
[02:37:44.173 --> 02:37:45.194]  Who the hell are her doctors?
[02:37:45.234 --> 02:37:46.514]  The same thing you said weeks before.
[02:37:46.934 --> 02:37:54.277]  So I think bigger than Hillary's illness is this attack on the freedom of the press, the attack on the free speech of medical professionals.
[02:37:55.097 --> 02:38:03.520]  And the fact that mainstream media would so gleefully go along with this oppression really concerns me.
[02:38:03.540 --> 02:38:04.701]  I mean, yes, there's an awakening.
[02:38:04.741 --> 02:38:05.921]  Yes, globalism's in trouble.
[02:38:06.582 --> 02:38:23.008]  But just like Julian Assange at WikiLeaks said last week, the media climate of hopping up and down with glee when the press is censored or medical professionals are censored really should concern everyone about where this country's going.
[02:38:24.292 --> 02:38:26.013]  I think you're absolutely right, Alex.
[02:38:26.193 --> 02:38:44.920]  One of the things why you, and again, I know you don't like my praising what we're doing and what you're doing, is one of the things that happened, and you have to remember, not only are they attacking you, but when she says Alex Jones has this conspiracy theory that I'm dying, she's clearly attacking me and others.
[02:38:44.940 --> 02:38:45.620]  No, exactly.
[02:38:45.681 --> 02:38:49.222]  No, if she says Alex Jones, they mean the pantheon of guests.
[02:38:50.137 --> 02:39:15.129]  Well, what they mean is a pantheon, but in particular they were hitting something I said, because it's very hard for someone like myself, forget who I am, Steve Pachinick is, but when you're a board examiner, board certified psychiatrist, you are a medical doctor from Cornell, Harvard, and MIT, it is very hard for the New York Times and CNN
[02:39:16.516 --> 02:39:17.978]  To come and attack you.
[02:39:17.998 --> 02:39:20.460]  In fact, that's why no one attacked you.
[02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:22.522]  They've been attacking us for this story every other guest.
[02:39:22.542 --> 02:39:22.702]  No, no, no.
[02:39:22.722 --> 02:39:24.444]  They've attacked you, but here's the difference.
[02:39:24.464 --> 02:39:27.948]  No, I'm saying they wouldn't attack you, and that was key because it was powerful.
[02:39:28.655 --> 02:39:29.756]  Well, that's exactly it.
[02:39:29.836 --> 02:39:45.023]  But what's happening, Alex, is that we're working so well together that in effect, I expected that Jeff Zucker, the head of CNN, not a very bright guy, not a smart guy, a guy who's just interested in money.
[02:39:45.443 --> 02:39:50.766]  And I expected him to shut down Dr. Drew, who's a board certified internist.
[02:39:51.066 --> 02:39:51.626]  And he did it.
[02:39:52.310 --> 02:40:00.161]  So what we're really watching, Alex, and this is happening across the board, is we're seeing the rise of fascism of the left.
[02:40:00.968 --> 02:40:19.975]  And that's what you're beginning to see as we're pulling back and we're becoming more successful in exposing the neocons, in exposing the Marie Antoinette, in exposing the incompetence of the CIA, the incompetence of the Secret Service, of the FBI, the Department of Justice.
[02:40:20.035 --> 02:40:27.558]  What happens is the only recourse they have is for their mechanisms and their outlets to shut down shows
[02:40:28.138 --> 02:40:32.639]  That we're very important in reaffirming a very objective concept.
[02:40:33.340 --> 02:40:34.340]  She is sick.
[02:40:34.580 --> 02:40:36.241]  There is no question about it.
[02:40:36.681 --> 02:40:45.203]  The problem I said, and that Dr. Drew said, and many other board examiners said, release the records from Columbia PNS.
[02:40:45.683 --> 02:40:51.145]  If you've been hospitalized for months on end, you have MRIs and CAT scans,
[02:40:51.573 --> 02:40:56.195]  That indicates she has brain damage, she has physical and mental problems.
[02:40:56.415 --> 02:40:57.756]  And the drumbeat's gotten stronger.
[02:40:57.776 --> 02:41:02.838]  And I agree, I agree, uncannily, what you said on air seemed to be a road map for all these other doctors to have courage.
[02:41:03.459 --> 02:41:05.620]  Clearly they were attacking you when they attacked me.
[02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:07.440]  So, so what does that signify?
[02:41:07.500 --> 02:41:12.883]  And now looking at her, again I'm not a doctor like you, but it looks, I mean, she looks like she's deteriorating quickly.
[02:41:13.621 --> 02:41:27.572]  Well, the point of fact is that the American public now, the veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, have to stand up as a group and say we cannot accept her as a candidate for the presidency of the United States.
[02:41:27.972 --> 02:41:36.919]  We cannot accept Zalmay Khalilzad or a Steve Hadley or another neocon to represent us or anybody in the Bush-Clinton
[02:41:37.479 --> 02:41:38.039]  Absolutely.
[02:41:52.927 --> 02:41:54.008]  Here comes the next problem.
[02:41:54.148 --> 02:41:57.509]  They may try, exactly, Dr. Finney, so how do you see them striking back?
[02:41:57.890 --> 02:41:58.650]  A false flag?
[02:41:58.690 --> 02:41:59.811]  An attempted assassination?
[02:41:59.911 --> 02:42:01.211]  I see demonstrations.
[02:42:01.431 --> 02:42:10.616]  I see women who have incredible signs about Hillary and her incompetence and the despicable behavior of her husband.
[02:42:10.996 --> 02:42:14.658]  I see Trump coming back and hitting them again and again and again.
[02:42:16.179 --> 02:42:22.246]  I see Bernie Sanders coming out and saying again what he should have said all along, which he has said.
[02:42:22.526 --> 02:42:23.507]  This is a corrupt administration.
[02:42:23.527 --> 02:42:27.411]  I was about to say, what does it signify that he rolled over for months and is suddenly coming out against her?
[02:42:28.152 --> 02:42:30.675]  Well, you know, that's a good point, Alex.
[02:42:31.156 --> 02:42:33.118]  I have a lot of respect for Bernie.
[02:42:33.198 --> 02:42:33.979]  I don't know him.
[02:42:34.179 --> 02:42:36.902]  I heard him in New Hampshire, but you know, he is a
[02:42:37.634 --> 02:42:47.297]  He's an online Jewish socialist from Brooklyn, but he represented a very important part of those young people who I expect them to demonstrate in the streets.
[02:42:47.797 --> 02:42:54.459]  Because he realized, he made a concession which was very poorly executed.
[02:42:54.659 --> 02:42:57.539]  And in fact, he was co-opted by Hillary.
[02:42:57.619 --> 02:42:59.580]  Whatever concession he made to her,
[02:43:00.200 --> 02:43:01.340]  She defaulted on it.
[02:43:01.480 --> 02:43:16.104]  And I think Bernie should come back in and reassert the concepts that he said and reaffirm the fact that he has to have his millennials protest against a person like Hillary, a Marie Antoinette, come back into the forefront.
[02:43:16.124 --> 02:43:16.364]  I agree.
[02:43:16.424 --> 02:43:19.065]  If Sanders came out and said... A neocon can never come back.
[02:43:19.605 --> 02:43:21.326]  Bernie is an important part of this.
[02:43:21.506 --> 02:43:26.787]  If Sanders came out and said Hillary stole the election, stole the nomination, it'd be it for Hillary.
[02:43:27.948 --> 02:43:29.448]  He said the business was rigged.
[02:43:30.362 --> 02:43:31.864]  Trump said the business was rigged.
[02:43:32.225 --> 02:43:35.750]  Trump exactly understood what you and I did.
[02:43:36.311 --> 02:43:41.378]  Bernie is the exact opposite and the mirror image of him and they want the same thing.
[02:43:42.515 --> 02:43:45.436]  One can build the condo, the other one has to pay for the land.
[02:43:45.456 --> 02:43:45.576]  Sure.
[02:43:45.696 --> 02:43:57.878]  Dr. Buchanek, I know you want to stay on the offensive, and that's always great and good, and you're talking to a general audience, but specifically, though, let's talk about how we expect the neocons, the globalists, the George Soros' to strike back.
[02:43:58.238 --> 02:44:02.879]  I'm really worried about an assassination attempt on Hillary, whether it's successful or not, making her a victim.
[02:44:02.899 --> 02:44:04.379]  If I was them, I'd be looking at that.
[02:44:04.900 --> 02:44:06.280]  Obviously, we don't want any harm against her.
[02:44:06.620 --> 02:44:09.640]  I'd be looking at some type of economic deal or maybe a new little war.
[02:44:10.461 --> 02:44:11.861]  I mean, if you were working for the other team,
[02:44:12.381 --> 02:44:18.087]  Well, one of the things that I'm getting at that seems to be out of control is the Zika virus nonsense.
[02:44:18.367 --> 02:44:31.020]  I mean, you know, for a virus to come out of Brazil and then contaminate Miami Beach and affect, I understand it affects women who have children, but beyond that, no one's going to get Guillain-Barre syndrome.
[02:44:31.460 --> 02:44:34.623]  I mean, we have a lot of, you know, issues that are at hand.
[02:44:35.003 --> 02:44:36.644]  Zika virus is not one of them.
[02:44:36.784 --> 02:44:39.727]  The economy is the second, probably the most important.
[02:44:39.747 --> 02:44:40.567]  That's my next question.
[02:44:40.727 --> 02:44:43.930]  What do you make of Saudi Arabia?
[02:44:44.350 --> 02:44:51.616]  Our people have to request that our soldiers come back from Africa, from Iraq and Syria.
[02:44:51.796 --> 02:44:54.017]  We never had a state of war declared.
[02:44:54.258 --> 02:45:00.983]  The president has no right to send the National Guard of Florida into Djibouti in Africa.
[02:45:01.599 --> 02:45:07.240]  I don't need to lose young Christian men and women into a war that has no national security.
[02:45:07.300 --> 02:45:07.900]  I've got another question.
[02:45:07.920 --> 02:45:08.580]  We've got to move quick.
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:15.861]  What do you make of the claim that Obama is negotiating around the clock with Putin to join him against ISIS?
[02:45:15.901 --> 02:45:21.382]  Isn't that just a way to cover up the fact that Hillary and him... Obama's finished.
[02:45:21.642 --> 02:45:28.124]  Basically what's happening is our forces there, whether they be mercenaries or whatever, work with the Russians.
[02:45:28.244 --> 02:45:30.224]  We've worked very closely with the Russians.
[02:45:30.764 --> 02:45:41.808]  ISIS is being degraded, but not because of Obama, but because they have a... No, no, he knows his little move was defeated, and so now he wants to act like as a legacy he jumped in to stop it.
[02:45:42.368 --> 02:45:43.889]  Yeah, but he has no legacy.
[02:45:44.009 --> 02:45:46.169]  There's absolutely no legacy for Obama.
[02:45:46.369 --> 02:45:46.830]  It's gone.
[02:45:47.150 --> 02:45:50.631]  It's just a black man who came in for eight years and disappeared.
[02:45:50.891 --> 02:45:52.311]  He's the invisible black man.
[02:45:52.611 --> 02:45:53.372]  That's all he was.
[02:45:54.692 --> 02:45:55.713]  And there's no legacy.
[02:45:56.053 --> 02:45:56.853]  ISIS is gone.
[02:45:57.623 --> 02:45:58.164]  Absolutely.
[02:45:58.784 --> 02:46:03.608]  And again, clearly, ISIS was a proxy army of some of the Gulf states, elements of NATO and others.
[02:46:03.628 --> 02:46:04.849]  It was a proxy army of the CIA.
[02:46:05.169 --> 02:46:14.256]  What we need in the next administration is defunding of the CIA and a Michael Flynn to take over to make sure that we don't have civilians who go out of control for the past four years.
[02:46:14.276 --> 02:46:17.339]  Well, sure, isn't the answer, because all the contacts the CIA has, is take it over?
[02:46:18.396 --> 02:46:42.648]  Well, the CIA is... What happened is, I'll be very frank, John Brennan, who was a disaster as the DDO in Saudi Arabia, came out and instead of taking human, that is, collecting intelligence, and understanding the cultural and psychological dimensions, decided to co-op what we call SOCOM, Special Operations Out of Command, and use them for drone warfare.
[02:46:42.748 --> 02:46:44.549]  In other words, we don't have any more intelligence.
[02:46:44.569 --> 02:46:45.429]  Which makes everybody hate you.
[02:46:45.449 --> 02:46:46.650]  See, what they don't get about human is,
[02:46:47.210 --> 02:46:48.871]  It's not just you can have electronic intelligence.
[02:46:49.251 --> 02:46:51.252]  They think HUMET is just gathering intelligence.
[02:46:51.512 --> 02:46:53.313]  HUMET is winning hearts and minds.
[02:46:53.593 --> 02:46:56.154]  You remove that and run around bombing people.
[02:46:56.214 --> 02:46:57.615]  That's the way you turn people against the country.
[02:46:58.157 --> 02:46:59.177]  That's exactly it.
[02:46:59.237 --> 02:47:06.698]  I mean, the essence of any war, the essence of any success, is understanding the enemy or the people and their culture.
[02:47:06.999 --> 02:47:08.419]  We have not done very well.
[02:47:08.859 --> 02:47:10.919]  And that has been a serious problem.
[02:47:11.579 --> 02:47:12.839]  But it seems like sabotage.
[02:47:12.920 --> 02:47:15.100]  They've got to know doing that would sabotage the U.S.
[02:47:15.160 --> 02:47:16.320]  I smell something bigger here.
[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:22.181]  And I know you always say it's an aptitude, and I agree there's a lot of that, but at a certain point, they're undermining the U.S.
[02:47:22.201 --> 02:47:23.521]  They're destroying our institutions.
[02:47:23.561 --> 02:47:25.122]  They're destroying our power.
[02:47:25.142 --> 02:47:27.302]  It's clear this is sabotage.
[02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:29.982]  Well, let me put it this way.
[02:47:30.102 --> 02:47:31.763]  I know you think it's sabotage.
[02:47:32.003 --> 02:47:38.289]  I call it so gross incompetence that 16 different units can't even integrate themselves.
[02:47:38.409 --> 02:47:45.815]  And we're spending tons of millions and trillions of dollars trying to figure out what's going on, yet we have no unified system.
[02:47:45.835 --> 02:47:46.456]  So it's mainly looting.
[02:47:46.496 --> 02:47:48.878]  Even with James Clapper, that's not enough.
[02:47:49.418 --> 02:47:49.498]  Sure.
[02:47:49.538 --> 02:47:53.582]  What we need is to clear out this entire system, to have a sweeper.
[02:47:54.102 --> 02:47:56.543]  And that's the kind of guy that Mike Flynn would come in.
[02:47:56.583 --> 02:47:58.303]  He knows exactly what the problem is.
[02:47:58.323 --> 02:48:01.384]  Yeah, what'd you make of Trump saying, I don't want to meet with the CIA, they'll just lie to me.
[02:48:01.724 --> 02:48:05.645]  And then Harry Reid goes, oh yeah, well we lied to the American people, we'll just give him fake briefings.
[02:48:05.685 --> 02:48:07.305]  And Trump goes, exactly, dumbass.
[02:48:07.805 --> 02:48:13.086]  I've got the army advising me, I don't need... Remember, Harry Reid worked in a house of prostitution before he became a Mormon.
[02:48:15.287 --> 02:48:16.307]  Well, he's obviously a mobster.
[02:48:18.151 --> 02:48:19.413]  Let me ask you this question, though.
[02:48:19.493 --> 02:48:23.237]  I mean, clearly, look how the things Trump says, the things he does are so smart.
[02:48:23.498 --> 02:48:24.880]  He's like, I don't want briefings from the CIA.
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:26.021]  I don't want a bunch of bull.
[02:48:26.141 --> 02:48:29.325]  He knows what the problem is, but he's got to clear out Christie.
[02:48:29.345 --> 02:48:30.987]  He's got to clear out Ben Carson.
[02:48:31.027 --> 02:48:33.070]  He's got to clear out all the neocons.
[02:48:33.591 --> 02:48:35.934]  And he has to understand that the government that we
[02:48:36.574 --> 02:48:38.615]  Why is the establishment so scared of Trump?
[02:48:38.675 --> 02:48:40.275]  I mean, for me, that's the biggest endorsement for him.
[02:48:58.440 --> 02:49:04.905]  One of the key elements in intelligence or politics is the ability to manipulate and create vulnerability.
[02:49:05.305 --> 02:49:09.789]  You want vulnerability in your enemy and your allies so you can manipulate them.
[02:49:10.349 --> 02:49:15.132]  The Clintons have a whole list of issues on everybody involved with them.
[02:49:15.233 --> 02:49:17.154]  They know exactly how to expose them.
[02:49:17.254 --> 02:49:22.238]  With a guy like Obama who had a homosexual history in Chicago, they know all about him.
[02:49:22.618 --> 02:49:23.799]  They know all about his mother.
[02:49:24.219 --> 02:49:28.185]  They know all about the fact the CIA came out of Occidental and came up.
[02:49:28.586 --> 02:49:34.174]  Hillary Clinton, a history of lesbian activities, a history of, you know, corruption.
[02:49:34.654 --> 02:49:36.998]  These are the things that we know, but...
[02:49:37.529 --> 02:49:40.190]  The system clearly wants to deny it.
[02:49:40.270 --> 02:49:44.972]  So what they have is manipulation and a co-optation of manipulation.
[02:49:45.052 --> 02:49:45.873]  That's all it is.
[02:49:46.033 --> 02:49:47.093]  It's part of pandering.
[02:49:47.494 --> 02:49:49.635]  It's part of ascendancy to power.
[02:49:50.015 --> 02:49:54.837]  And that's what you have to have a people who have no relationship to them, who are not beholden to them.
[02:49:55.437 --> 02:49:57.879]  And that's why I came in and out of administrations.
[02:49:58.099 --> 02:49:59.821]  I never stayed in one administration.
[02:50:00.201 --> 02:50:01.562]  I never accepted a pension.
[02:50:01.963 --> 02:50:04.144]  I never accepted a promotion in the military.
[02:50:04.505 --> 02:50:06.226]  So there was nothing they could do for me.
[02:50:06.346 --> 02:50:08.608]  If they wanted me, it's because of what I could bring to them.
[02:50:09.008 --> 02:50:11.050]  But the reality is, I didn't need them.
[02:50:11.370 --> 02:50:12.371]  They needed me more.
[02:50:13.288 --> 02:50:19.871]  And now the issue is what can we do in America to make sure we're no longer vulnerable to this kind of nonsense?
[02:50:20.091 --> 02:50:24.573]  Absolutely, because these people are out of control and you can smell their end is coming.
[02:50:24.913 --> 02:50:34.797]  The problem is... Well, but Alex, part of what you're doing and a great part of what you're doing is the spearhead of cutting through again and we need to keep going because
[02:50:35.317 --> 02:50:38.259]  The election will be rigged, there's no question about it.
[02:50:38.780 --> 02:50:41.181]  It is totally rigged, contrary to what the President said.
[02:50:41.201 --> 02:50:45.445]  Hold on, I gotta skip this break, this is too important, even though it won't even be a network, people will take over, so it doesn't matter.
[02:50:45.945 --> 02:50:46.725]  We're all in now.
[02:50:47.226 --> 02:50:49.307]  Clearly they're bringing in multinationals.
[02:50:49.668 --> 02:50:54.531]  They went from saying, those are things, election fraud, to now we're gonna save it with Homeland Security running it.
[02:50:54.791 --> 02:50:56.332]  That's what Roger Sheldon said a month before they did that.
[02:50:56.352 --> 02:50:56.913]  He said, Alex,
[02:50:57.353 --> 02:51:15.243]  Watch, they're going to quote, keep it from being a fraud, they're going to protect the election, that's who does it, and now they're going to have Justice Department computer teams hooked in lovingly monitoring everyone, giant foxes guarding the head house from the imaginary Russians who can't even hardly keep their electricity on right now with the GDP of Italy.
[02:51:15.263 --> 02:51:21.026]  And so now you're stating yes, you think it's going to be rigged, with them now responding they've got to protect it.
[02:51:21.346 --> 02:51:22.166]  How do we counter that?
[02:51:22.186 --> 02:51:23.167]  How do we get Donald Trump in?
[02:51:23.487 --> 02:51:29.990]  What you say is we don't want you anywhere near there, and we have what you call for an independent electoral volunteers.
[02:51:30.250 --> 02:51:31.571]  We don't need the Justice Department.
[02:51:31.591 --> 02:51:32.591]  There is no justice.
[02:51:32.992 --> 02:51:33.952]  It's not a department.
[02:51:34.272 --> 02:51:35.653]  We don't need Homeland Security.
[02:51:36.093 --> 02:51:42.276]  I agree, but how naked is it to have Obama saying there's no such thing as fraud, but now he's got to come take control of it to keep it safe?
[02:51:42.296 --> 02:51:44.337]  You know, stupid is as stupid does.
[02:51:44.557 --> 02:51:46.038]  Obama's irrelevant now.
[02:51:46.158 --> 02:51:51.981]  He's just an ignorant individual who came to power thanks to the CIA, but he's irrelevant.
[02:51:52.401 --> 02:51:58.123]  So is he just one more guy with his little government badge and thinks that's like he's God?
[02:51:58.844 --> 02:52:00.444]  Well, it's not relevant anymore.
[02:52:00.524 --> 02:52:02.905]  If we ignore him, all he has to do is write his books.
[02:52:02.945 --> 02:52:16.530]  But the truth of the matter is, you hit on the key point, which is to get the volunteers, all of us, out there to the electoral booth to make sure we can see people voting and make sure that we take information as they came out as to who voted.
[02:52:16.590 --> 02:52:17.771]  Alright, let me do this.
[02:52:17.811 --> 02:52:20.192]  Let's say Donald Trump, here's five minutes of the show today.
[02:52:21.374 --> 02:52:26.256]  Dr. Steve Machinic, I'm gonna let you go and I appreciate your time and I hand the baton to Paul Watson with a big fourth hour coming up.
[02:52:26.717 --> 02:52:28.538]  I mean his engines are on, they're red hot.
[02:52:29.038 --> 02:52:30.458]  All pistons are, you know, firing.
[02:52:31.319 --> 02:52:35.961]  Steve Machinic, you're talking to Donald Trump, you're talking to his crew, you're talking to his advisors right now.
[02:52:36.361 --> 02:52:37.402]  What would you say to Donald Trump?
[02:52:38.266 --> 02:52:47.214]  I would say get rid of Christie, get rid of Ben Carson, clear out your whole transition team, let me see who's on it in terms of foreign policy.
[02:52:47.294 --> 02:52:51.658]  Avoid any neocons, Steve Hadley, Salme Khalilzad, anyone else.
[02:52:51.878 --> 02:53:00.406]  Now, when you go into the debate, you can call the shots, you can determine whether you want to walk off stage, whether you want to make it five minutes, ten minutes.
[02:53:00.826 --> 02:53:05.531]  Do not let the reporters determine your outcome on your debates.
[02:53:05.591 --> 02:53:07.072]  The debate now is yours.
[02:53:07.513 --> 02:53:09.474]  You can do whatever you want with it.
[02:53:09.594 --> 02:53:14.960]  If it conflicts with the NFL, then refuse to come on board because it's not going to change anything.
[02:53:15.560 --> 02:53:19.344]  The second thing I would do is to hit Hillary on every issue.
[02:53:19.904 --> 02:53:21.124]  That she is vulnerable.
[02:53:21.144 --> 02:53:23.305]  The 156,000 an hour.
[02:53:23.325 --> 02:53:26.085]  The fact that she hasn't accomplished anything.
[02:53:26.385 --> 02:53:27.946]  Not anything as a senator.
[02:53:27.966 --> 02:53:28.946]  Not one bill.
[02:53:29.406 --> 02:53:30.826]  She accomplished nothing.
[02:53:30.866 --> 02:53:31.967]  Libya failed state.
[02:53:32.047 --> 02:53:33.267]  Turned ISIS loose.
[02:53:33.287 --> 02:53:34.727]  Killed hundreds of thousands in Syria.
[02:53:34.747 --> 02:53:35.407]  Not only that.
[02:53:35.927 --> 02:53:36.828]  You know what she did?
[02:53:37.228 --> 02:53:39.148]  Even in the Clinton Foundation.
[02:53:39.168 --> 02:53:41.489]  They contributed to the death of 10,000 Haitians.
[02:53:43.289 --> 02:53:53.295]  Innocent Haitian people who I love and I've worked with because they brought in Nepalese UN peacekeepers and the UN was guilty of this crime.
[02:53:53.335 --> 02:53:54.716]  Did you see the FBI?
[02:53:55.016 --> 02:53:57.638]  Did you see the International Criminal Court come after them?
[02:53:57.918 --> 02:53:58.098]  No.
[02:53:58.618 --> 02:54:06.043]  But Chelsea even said that this was a case of gross negligence of her mother and father, yet not one mention was made.
[02:54:06.823 --> 02:54:20.349]  10,000 Haitians were killed because the Clintons went down there and couldn't organize an effective cleanup, and instead the Nepalese used the water system to defecate in there.
[02:54:20.789 --> 02:54:25.511]  And the Secretary General of the UN, who's South Korean, is not held accountable.
[02:54:25.751 --> 02:54:27.552]  The UN is not held accountable.
[02:54:28.112 --> 02:54:32.094]  And so now... Let's be clear, the UN comes, sets up a water treatment, and then craps at it.
[02:54:32.785 --> 02:54:33.325]  You got it.
[02:54:34.646 --> 02:54:36.227]  I didn't want to use that, but you used it.
[02:54:36.267 --> 02:54:36.848]  That's correct.
[02:54:37.448 --> 02:54:38.729]  So they've killed people.
[02:54:39.189 --> 02:54:48.115]  The other thing that was brought out, and Trump has to bring it out, it was Hillary who told Bill Clinton not to intercede in the genocide at Rwanda.
[02:54:48.135 --> 02:54:48.515]  That's right.
[02:54:48.535 --> 02:54:50.257]  She said Bill Clinton is an Africa.
[02:54:50.637 --> 02:54:55.320]  He's not an Africa because he cares about the Africans, or he gives a damn about them.
[02:54:55.440 --> 02:55:01.404]  He cares because he was convicted indirectly by me and others of having killed
[02:55:01.983 --> 02:55:17.913]  Because of gross negligence, a million Hutu and Tutsis, he was warned about it, Sandy Berger was warned months beforehand that the Chinese had machetes, the French themselves had machine guns when they shot down the Tutsis.
[02:55:18.294 --> 02:55:23.457]  The French did this, and the French didn't take any responsibility, nor did the Belgians.
[02:55:23.917 --> 02:55:27.758]  But this was Hillary Clinton telling Bill, don't get involved.
[02:55:27.859 --> 02:55:29.119]  And instead, what did he do?
[02:55:29.179 --> 02:55:30.259]  He bombed Serbia.
[02:55:30.780 --> 02:55:31.520]  For what reasons?
[02:55:31.700 --> 02:55:32.580]  Absolutely none.
[02:55:32.980 --> 02:55:38.803]  So he had a most incompetent general, Wes Clark, of the Air Force, send a bunch of bombers in there.
[02:55:39.163 --> 02:55:43.284]  But when he had to act, or she had to act, people died.
[02:55:43.664 --> 02:55:46.325]  They died again, and again, and again.
[02:55:46.425 --> 02:55:47.986]  We could no longer afford that.
[02:55:48.366 --> 02:55:50.788]  And America will stand up in a revolution.
[02:55:51.148 --> 02:55:53.810]  A quiet revolution, but it will be a revolution.
[02:55:53.930 --> 02:55:54.410]  I agree.
[02:55:54.611 --> 02:56:00.775]  And just keep hammering the fact that he just represents this huge populist movement to bring nationalism and the Renaissance back.
[02:56:00.795 --> 02:56:01.756]  He is the revolution!
[02:56:02.566 --> 02:56:12.232]  I would also point out that the first moderator they've got is admittedly part of her foundation, and of course others they're announcing also have been caught working for the Clintons.
[02:56:12.512 --> 02:56:17.896]  So if I was Trump, I'd just say this moderator right here, which I just want to say right now at the start, is a fraud and works for Hillary.
[02:56:18.536 --> 02:56:19.157]  That's correct.
[02:56:36.070 --> 02:56:36.890]  Anderson Cooper.
[02:56:37.270 --> 02:56:38.271]  I mean, is that a joke?
[02:56:38.331 --> 02:56:39.191]  Is that not a joke?
[02:56:39.231 --> 02:56:44.273]  I mean, I know he was trained by the CIA, spent a couple of years in the summers in the CIA.
[02:56:45.193 --> 02:56:51.175]  He talks about the most absurd things on Sandy Hook and 9-11, and then come and attacks us.
[02:56:51.535 --> 02:56:52.815]  This is Anderson Cooper?
[02:56:53.296 --> 02:56:54.516]  Come on, give me a break.
[02:56:55.076 --> 02:56:56.957]  I mean, he's kind of a cute little boy.
[02:56:56.977 --> 02:57:00.858]  He's not even a man who can really ask serious questions.
[02:57:01.423 --> 02:57:05.066]  Their narcissism has to be controlled and manipulated by Trump.
[02:57:05.126 --> 02:57:05.766]  He gets it.
[02:57:06.447 --> 02:57:08.348]  None of this should be acceptable to him.
[02:57:08.448 --> 02:57:10.230]  But it's the American people... How does he do it?
[02:57:10.250 --> 02:57:11.611]  Let's say with Cooper as a moderator.
[02:57:11.651 --> 02:57:12.451]  I mean, what did he just point out?
[02:57:12.892 --> 02:57:16.134]  Oh, it's the little blue blood... What is it?
[02:57:16.294 --> 02:57:16.694]  Astor?
[02:57:16.734 --> 02:57:19.596]  Or is it... It's a... Yeah.
[02:57:19.877 --> 02:57:20.417]  It's Astor?
[02:57:20.437 --> 02:57:23.679]  Or is it... I forget which royal... No, it's the... Yeah.
[02:57:23.739 --> 02:57:24.660]  Yeah, I know.
[02:57:24.780 --> 02:57:25.441]  It's not the Astor.
[02:57:25.481 --> 02:57:26.141]  I always flip it.
[02:57:26.181 --> 02:57:27.062]  It's the Vanderbilt.
[02:57:27.202 --> 02:57:32.285]  Vanderbilt was nothing more than the Dutch demon.
[02:57:32.365 --> 02:57:36.608]  You know, they make up their own... Sure, so I mean how would you just, in psychological warfare, go after the moderator?
[02:57:36.628 --> 02:57:40.270]  What would you say like, oh you work for Hillary's foundation, how impartial?
[02:57:40.511 --> 02:57:41.871]  Just want to point that out up front.
[02:57:42.132 --> 02:57:43.913]  Or like, what would you say to Cooper?
[02:57:44.153 --> 02:57:47.115]  Oh, Mr. Cooper, do you tell your audience you were in the CIA?
[02:57:47.175 --> 02:57:49.036]  Or that you're a big donor to the Clintons?
[02:57:49.036 --> 02:57:49.336]  Correct.
[02:57:49.496 --> 02:57:56.143]  I mean, you know, it's the kind of information in psyops you can deny, distort, or deflect.
[02:57:56.283 --> 02:57:59.767]  It's up to him to decide what he wants to do or have his own opinion.
[02:57:59.787 --> 02:58:01.809]  But put him on the hot seat like Tane.
[02:58:01.849 --> 02:58:04.011]  Listen, don't tell me guns are causing the mass murder.
[02:58:04.312 --> 02:58:07.395]  It's these psychotropics that are your main sponsors, Pierce.
[02:58:08.776 --> 02:58:09.277]  That's correct.
[02:58:09.986 --> 02:58:12.589]  I mean, there isn't one there that isn't open.
[02:58:12.689 --> 02:58:17.113]  I mean, what they did was to pick one of diversity, and it was their own people.
[02:58:17.894 --> 02:58:21.437]  I'm just saying, regardless of who it is, these people are jokes, and they're wide open.
[02:58:21.878 --> 02:58:24.380]  Dr. Pachinik, twitter at stevepachinik.com.
[02:58:24.440 --> 02:58:27.143]  P-I-E-C-Z-E-N-I-K.
[02:58:27.463 --> 02:58:28.725]  Steve Pachinik, did I say it right?
[02:58:28.765 --> 02:58:32.528]  Steve P-I-E-C-Z-E-N-I-K.
[02:58:32.569 --> 02:58:33.590]  Doc, we'll talk to you again soon.
[02:58:33.610 --> 02:58:33.830]  Thank you.
[02:58:34.520 --> 02:58:35.861]  It's a pleasure, and thank you.
[02:58:36.242 --> 02:58:36.602]  Thank you.
[02:58:36.742 --> 02:58:38.844]  I tell ya, it's epic time to be alive right now.
[02:58:38.964 --> 02:58:40.105]  Amazing things are happening.
[02:58:40.125 --> 02:58:44.349]  Paul Joseph Watson, hosting from London, England, is straight ahead in 70 seconds.
[02:58:44.729 --> 02:58:49.274]  Don't forget, we've got up to 40% off with storable food right now at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:58:49.714 --> 02:58:50.575]  Other big discounts.
[02:58:51.035 --> 02:58:52.316]  September is Preparedness Month.
[02:58:52.577 --> 02:58:54.058]  I'll introduce Paul straight ahead.
[02:59:00.197 --> 02:59:01.218]  Brainforce is here.
[02:59:01.758 --> 02:59:04.019]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:59:04.299 --> 02:59:12.102]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brainforce.
[02:59:12.901 --> 02:59:16.484]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[02:59:16.504 --> 02:59:18.846]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:59:19.206 --> 02:59:22.709]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:59:22.769 --> 02:59:25.891]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:59:26.412 --> 02:59:31.196]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:59:31.756 --> 02:59:33.578]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[02:59:33.918 --> 02:59:38.341]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:59:38.502 --> 02:59:40.523]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:59:41.144 --> 02:59:42.605]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:59:42.745 --> 02:59:43.005]  Exactly.
[02:59:43.025 --> 02:59:46.808]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:59:47.308 --> 02:59:55.494]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:55.554 --> 02:59:58.417]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:22.924 --> 03:00:23.644]  Big Brother.
[03:00:24.065 --> 03:00:25.305]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:25.846 --> 03:00:27.787]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:27.807 --> 03:00:29.167]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:00:29.447 --> 03:00:30.688]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:31.108 --> 03:00:35.651]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:37.652 --> 03:00:44.535]  Paul Joseph Watson will be joining us coming up in the next segment.
[03:00:45.016 --> 03:00:46.997]  We're waiting for him to get in the studio.
[03:00:48.604 --> 03:00:50.665]  Lots of people say, what are you doing cutting in on Watson's time?
[03:00:50.685 --> 03:00:51.966]  I'm trying to get Paul on the air more.
[03:00:52.006 --> 03:00:52.807]  He is a great talent.
[03:00:53.427 --> 03:00:53.907]  A great patriot.
[03:00:53.927 --> 03:00:57.029]  We're trying to get him to move here to Texas and be in a proper studio here.
[03:00:57.590 --> 03:00:59.531]  And probably make him move here, but whatever.
[03:01:00.391 --> 03:01:02.153]  Paul Joseph Watson coming up.
[03:01:03.228 --> 03:01:07.913]  I didn't really plug properly last hour, so I'm going to do it again right now because I want to hire a couple more reporters.
[03:01:08.313 --> 03:01:10.316]  I want to be able to get a couple more writers.
[03:01:11.016 --> 03:01:17.964]  I want to be able to be able to send a camera crew somewhere and then not be missing a camera crew.
[03:01:17.984 --> 03:01:20.807]  We've got kind of like two camera crews right now, but we need three or four.
[03:01:20.867 --> 03:01:25.772]  We need a couple more editors, a couple more writers, so that we're not all killing ourselves and having typos and stuff.
[03:01:26.232 --> 03:01:28.134]  And so I want to thank you all for supporting the broadcast.
[03:01:28.154 --> 03:01:28.874]  We're all in this together.
[03:01:29.555 --> 03:01:45.849]  September is Preparedness Month, and we have got, right now, we've got 40% off, 30 to 40% off depending on which package it is, on high-quality, swearable food, 20% off on Survival Shield, Nacin I and I and X2, 20% off on Alexa Pure air filters and water filters, and so much more.
[03:01:47.159 --> 03:01:50.041]  And these are already the very best gravity-fed filters out there.
[03:01:50.061 --> 03:01:51.522]  We carry, like, four different brands.
[03:01:51.682 --> 03:01:52.703]  Some are apples and oranges.
[03:01:52.763 --> 03:01:53.524]  Some are better than this.
[03:01:53.964 --> 03:01:54.685]  Some are better than that.
[03:01:54.725 --> 03:01:56.206]  But they're all excellent.
[03:01:56.566 --> 03:01:59.848]  Gravity-fed that cut out the fluoride and the glyphosate and hundreds and hundreds of other things.
[03:02:00.309 --> 03:02:02.090]  Or reduce it down to non-detectable levels or 99999.
[03:02:03.251 --> 03:02:06.493]  The point is, there are a lot of filters out there that cost as much as these.
[03:02:06.533 --> 03:02:07.594]  Just take out the bad taste.
[03:02:07.935 --> 03:02:10.837]  Whether it's Alexa Pure or Pro Pure, the specials on Alexa Pure right now.
[03:02:10.857 --> 03:02:11.357]  20% off.
[03:02:11.377 --> 03:02:11.757]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:02:14.264 --> 03:02:16.025]  And listen, I never set out.
[03:02:16.466 --> 03:02:17.807]  I didn't go to school for media.
[03:02:18.527 --> 03:02:22.751]  I don't sit there and read books on NLP and, you know, all this stuff.
[03:02:23.211 --> 03:02:25.213]  I'm just a patriot that wants to fight tyranny.
[03:02:25.873 --> 03:02:27.795]  And I know sometimes the broadcast is a train wreck.
[03:02:27.835 --> 03:02:31.778]  And we have an amazing crew doing this whole show live for three, four hours every day.
[03:02:32.098 --> 03:02:35.962]  Three hours of myself, four hours of the guest every day that does the fourth hour.
[03:02:37.523 --> 03:02:40.305]  And it's stressful.
[03:02:41.566 --> 03:02:43.368]  But I understand how big
[03:02:44.568 --> 03:02:46.330]  The stakes are, so I am honored to be here.
[03:02:46.350 --> 03:02:50.094]  But don't ever think that I don't know that sometimes I'm a train wreck.
[03:02:50.535 --> 03:02:55.561]  But there are those moments where we really have the big effect and we see what we're doing having a huge global effect.
[03:02:55.581 --> 03:02:57.723]  And quite frankly, it's becoming more and more common.
[03:02:58.004 --> 03:03:00.006]  So I'm just honored to be associated with all of you.
[03:03:00.406 --> 03:03:01.448]  I'm very, very appreciative.
[03:03:01.468 --> 03:03:03.290]  I say I've got the best crew I've ever had.
[03:03:03.590 --> 03:03:05.593]  Hands down, we get better over the years.
[03:03:05.953 --> 03:03:06.794]  Things are more stressful.
[03:03:07.095 --> 03:03:08.476]  We do a lot more, you get better.
[03:03:08.717 --> 03:03:10.519]  We've had a lot of great crew over the years as well.
[03:03:11.720 --> 03:03:14.424]  People that have come and gone for whatever reason.
[03:03:14.444 --> 03:03:19.190]  Sometimes we have a reporter and they've got a family member that's sick in New York so they move back.
[03:03:20.972 --> 03:03:21.973]  That type of stuff happens.
[03:03:23.180 --> 03:03:28.724]  Everybody that I've worked with, and you the listeners, are just such an important part of this whole operation.
[03:03:28.964 --> 03:03:29.865]  Take Jakari Jackson.
[03:03:29.905 --> 03:03:31.346]  He was here four years.
[03:03:32.127 --> 03:03:35.670]  And before he worked here, he had a dream to, you know, be a comic book publisher.
[03:03:36.110 --> 03:03:38.312]  And he told me, hey, I'm looking at doing this down the road.
[03:03:38.632 --> 03:03:40.954]  And so, you know, Jakari has gone on to do that now.
[03:03:41.294 --> 03:03:48.880]  But the work he's done, battling the New World Order, I don't blame him after four tours in the info war wanting to do something else.
[03:03:49.920 --> 03:03:51.181]  And so, you know, Jakari's moved on.
[03:03:51.621 --> 03:03:52.221]  But it doesn't matter.
[03:03:52.341 --> 03:03:59.603]  What he's done here will always, especially the video intros he's done are some of the best, very talented, will still be part of the show as long as the broadcast goes on.
[03:04:00.063 --> 03:04:00.763]  That's what it's all about.
[03:04:02.084 --> 03:04:07.325]  I quite frankly, after 25 years in the trenches, 21 years on air, I would like to ride off in the sunset sometime.
[03:04:07.785 --> 03:04:09.246]  I don't hate my job, I love it.
[03:04:09.646 --> 03:04:12.427]  It's just that there's so much to cover, so much to do.
[03:04:13.752 --> 03:04:18.414]  That I just don't even feel like I'm up to this incredible challenge sometimes.
[03:04:18.434 --> 03:04:24.596]  I mean, because I'm a humble person and I know for a fact CENTCOM and SOUTHCOM listen.
[03:04:24.676 --> 03:04:26.697]  I know for a fact current top generals do.
[03:04:27.057 --> 03:04:28.858]  I know for a fact Donald Trump does.
[03:04:29.298 --> 03:04:31.679]  I know for, I mean, I'm talking a lot.
[03:04:32.259 --> 03:04:33.900]  I know for a fact foreign leaders do.
[03:04:34.420 --> 03:04:36.781]  And it's like, wow, why did anybody else see this narrative?
[03:04:36.801 --> 03:04:38.522]  Why did anybody else read what the globalists were up to?
[03:04:39.346 --> 03:04:42.108]  Well, most people just get into politics or get in the military.
[03:04:42.148 --> 03:04:42.929]  They just do their job.
[03:04:42.969 --> 03:04:54.197]  They focus on the issues that are put out there by the newspaper, not realizing the globalists have created a whole false template, a whole false grid, a false reality to blind us from what's really going on.
[03:04:54.537 --> 03:04:59.961]  And InfoWars is just a hole in that electronic Berlin Wall curtain letting sunlight in.
[03:05:00.402 --> 03:05:01.963]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:05:02.683 --> 03:05:05.285]  But it's not just hiring new reporters to expand.
[03:05:05.746 --> 03:05:08.728]  It's hiring new crew for some of the attrition that takes place.
[03:05:12.268 --> 03:05:15.429]  You said in a speech today you're afraid this election is going to be rigged.
[03:05:15.770 --> 03:05:17.510]  I've been hearing about it for a long time.
[03:05:17.650 --> 03:05:20.452]  I hope the Republicans get out there and watch very closely.
[03:05:20.472 --> 03:05:23.133]  This new poll is showing a big convention balance for Hillary Clinton.
[03:05:23.253 --> 03:05:27.295]  Following her nomination at the Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton now leads it.
[03:05:27.575 --> 03:05:29.756]  Donald Trump, 50% to 42%.
[03:05:30.136 --> 03:05:32.297]  That's a 7 point jump from last week.
[03:05:32.417 --> 03:05:34.858]  You see, he's supposed to just sit there and let them steal it.
[03:05:35.038 --> 03:05:37.199]  But he didn't sit there, so they failed.
[03:05:38.248 --> 03:05:45.269]  And they think they're gonna have another stolen general election in front of everybody at high noon, and we're just gonna sit here and go along with it.
[03:05:45.430 --> 03:05:45.791]  We're not.
[03:05:46.852 --> 03:05:47.552]  I'm gonna fight it.
[03:05:47.792 --> 03:05:48.633]  Trump's gonna fight it.
[03:05:48.893 --> 03:05:49.593]  You're gonna fight it.
[03:05:49.753 --> 03:05:51.834]  Bob Mulholland from Chico, California.
[03:05:51.854 --> 03:05:55.015]  I'm a DNC member, thus a superdelegate to the National Convention.
[03:05:55.295 --> 03:05:56.035]  First of all, it's rigged.
[03:05:56.636 --> 03:05:59.117]  And I'm afraid the election's gonna be rigged, I have to be honest.
[03:05:59.777 --> 03:06:04.639]  And the way we work is that anybody who gets 15% more in an election gets delegates.
[03:06:04.799 --> 03:06:06.779]  So this election will go all the way to California.
[03:06:07.140 --> 03:06:10.861]  Sanders will end up with well over a thousand delegates and Hillary will get the nomination.
[03:06:11.101 --> 03:06:19.788]  Hillary Clinton has had every advantage, every break given to her from the very beginning by this Democratic Party.
[03:06:19.908 --> 03:06:20.849]  It has been rigged.
[03:06:20.989 --> 03:06:32.738]  It is clearly the case that when given truth serum, Debbie Wasserman Schultz vastly prefers Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, obviously, and to the extent there are things that can be done institutionally and largely to
[03:06:33.338 --> 03:06:35.241]  Facilitate that outcome, they are being done.
[03:06:35.381 --> 03:06:43.630]  If Hillary steals the nomination, and then she openly is engaged in chicanery and things don't add up with Trump, you have to say it must be thrown out.
[03:06:44.011 --> 03:06:46.854]  The political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[03:06:47.775 --> 03:06:49.236]  Contrary to popular belief.
[03:06:49.637 --> 03:06:51.179]  Then why are they holding the primaries?
[03:06:52.176 --> 03:06:53.377]  That's a very good question.
[03:06:53.417 --> 03:06:57.179]  WikiLeaks has dumped nearly 20,000 hacked emails from the DNC.
[03:06:57.219 --> 03:07:04.502]  We're talking about the report of leaked DNC emails showing an effort to undermine Bernie Sanders during the primaries.
[03:07:04.843 --> 03:07:09.105]  The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.
[03:07:09.905 --> 03:07:14.867]  When did the press see it as their role to protect the prerogative of the powerful?
[03:07:14.927 --> 03:07:15.928]  Actually, I think that's part of it.
[03:07:16.168 --> 03:07:19.870]  And we're not going to recognize Queen Hillary if there's evidence of fraud.
[03:07:20.190 --> 03:07:21.210]  And guess what there is?
[03:07:21.310 --> 03:07:23.211]  She stole the nomination.
[03:07:23.511 --> 03:07:26.252]  I want to thank Bernie Sanders.
[03:07:27.233 --> 03:07:32.075]  If he would have just not done anything, just go home, go to sleep, relax, he would have been a hero.
[03:07:32.235 --> 03:07:33.976]  But he made a deal with the devil.
[03:07:33.996 --> 03:07:34.516]  She's the devil.
[03:07:34.536 --> 03:07:35.977]  He made a deal with the devil.
[03:07:37.541 --> 03:07:43.405]  The media has created the perception that the voters will decide the nomination and that's the concept, that's the conflict here.
[03:07:43.445 --> 03:07:45.406]  We feel like we live in a democratic society.
[03:07:45.426 --> 03:07:50.730]  What you're telling me is it's not a democratic society and your votes don't necessarily matter because it's a democratic representation.
[03:07:50.830 --> 03:07:53.091]  Crooked Hillary thinks they're gonna pull the lid on Mitt Romney?
[03:07:53.272 --> 03:07:55.233]  Mm, lady, isn't gonna happen.
[03:07:55.433 --> 03:08:00.536]  That's why her campaign head, her chief strategist said, this is dangerous what Trump's doing.
[03:08:00.937 --> 03:08:02.338]  You're right, it is dangerous, isn't it?
[03:08:02.998 --> 03:08:04.279]  Actually standing up to you.
[03:08:04.559 --> 03:08:07.161]  There has to come a point at which you say, enough.
[03:08:23.847 --> 03:08:29.892]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:30.052 --> 03:08:33.214]  You know what's crazy?
[03:08:33.334 --> 03:08:35.035]  I just feel like a regular guy, because I am.
[03:08:36.857 --> 03:08:42.203]  And then we simply take action against the globalists, and you can see it's having huge worldwide effects.
[03:08:42.603 --> 03:08:44.045]  They admit it in fear.
[03:08:46.267 --> 03:08:54.356]  And I try to talk to the average man around me who doesn't, you know, work in this fight, and they're just like oblivious, and ask me what I think about fantasy football and tailgating.
[03:08:55.191 --> 03:09:02.576]  And I'm like, dude, I don't want to sit around tailgates getting drunk eating barbecue with mosquitoes biting me in Texas heat of 95 degrees.
[03:09:02.636 --> 03:09:05.117]  I mean, you know, I mean, there's a world government.
[03:09:05.137 --> 03:09:07.139]  They're putting cancer viruses in vaccines.
[03:09:07.779 --> 03:09:12.922]  They admit that they're having drones, a Google drone car spying on the police.
[03:09:13.423 --> 03:09:15.004]  The technocracy is taking over.
[03:09:16.650 --> 03:09:18.933]  We've got all this media censorship going on.
[03:09:19.954 --> 03:09:21.736]  World government's coming into place.
[03:09:22.417 --> 03:09:25.580]  Where is the self-preservation?
[03:09:26.361 --> 03:09:29.265]  Now Paul Joseph Watson joins us from his studios in London.
[03:09:29.665 --> 03:09:36.153]  For some reason, or I guess he's in France today, for some reason 007 doesn't have video links today.
[03:09:37.737 --> 03:09:43.380]  So he joins us now via audio, and I'm going to hand the baton to him here in a second.
[03:09:43.400 --> 03:09:46.322]  But Paul, what do you make of this bizarreness?
[03:09:46.442 --> 03:09:50.345]  I'm going to shoot a video today with Dew on this that we're going to have done for the Nightly News.
[03:09:51.912 --> 03:09:53.274]  Or if not, it'll be done for the show tomorrow.
[03:09:53.814 --> 03:10:03.665]  Where we have Obama saying there's no such thing as election fraud, but now we have the UN and the EU and the Justice Department coming in to take it over because the Russians are running it.
[03:10:04.285 --> 03:10:06.067]  I mean, this is getting ridiculous.
[03:10:06.127 --> 03:10:10.452]  This is getting crazy town that they've now reached this level.
[03:10:10.892 --> 03:10:13.275]  And what's even wilder is, you know, we kicked the ball off.
[03:10:14.172 --> 03:10:17.115]  With that report about election fraud and Trump should make it a major issue.
[03:10:17.415 --> 03:10:18.836]  He did make it the major issue.
[03:10:19.276 --> 03:10:20.778]  And they seem to be crapping their pants.
[03:10:21.178 --> 03:10:25.462]  And then icing on the top is that Hillary cannot talk anywhere now.
[03:10:25.862 --> 03:10:27.343]  Three different press talks.
[03:10:28.224 --> 03:10:29.986]  And none of them are real press conferences.
[03:10:30.046 --> 03:10:30.887]  One was a crowd of people.
[03:10:30.967 --> 03:10:32.308]  One was her sick of fans on a plane.
[03:10:32.588 --> 03:10:33.989]  And then one was talking to a single reporter.
[03:10:34.550 --> 03:10:36.872]  She can't stop coughing for 20 seconds.
[03:10:37.032 --> 03:10:38.073]  What is going on?
[03:10:40.359 --> 03:10:47.022]  Well, Alex, I mean, the backlash from this latest bout of coughing fits has really come to the fore today.
[03:10:47.582 --> 03:10:51.143]  You've got the Washington Post coming out with an article about an hour or two ago.
[03:10:51.163 --> 03:11:05.409]  And, you know, we've had people, we have people every day getting really butthurt about Matt Drudge's headlines and who he links to, but now the Washington Post has basically devoted an entire article whining about who Matt Drudge links to.
[03:11:05.469 --> 03:11:09.891]  It's called, Can We Just Stop Talking About Hillary Clinton's Health Now?
[03:11:10.728 --> 03:11:14.086]  And it basically goes through, tries to make the claim.
[03:11:14.815 --> 03:11:16.136]  Let me find the exact words.
[03:11:46.436 --> 03:11:47.876]  It's a complete meltdown.
[03:11:47.916 --> 03:11:50.717]  Hillary claimed that Putin was running the alt-right.
[03:11:50.757 --> 03:11:51.977]  I mean, that was the pinnacle of it.
[03:11:52.298 --> 03:12:02.161]  But this article says, oh, these concerns are completely ridiculous because Hillary's personal internist produced a letter to say that Hillary was fine.
[03:12:02.521 --> 03:12:05.362]  So because her personal physician said she was fine, that didn't move on.
[03:12:05.382 --> 03:12:06.863]  And Hillary said she didn't have any emails.
[03:12:06.923 --> 03:12:10.784]  Remember, there wasn't, three years ago, there wasn't even a second server, Paul.
[03:12:12.304 --> 03:12:13.645]  But then it goes on to say,
[03:12:14.463 --> 03:12:16.064]  Why aren't we talking about Trump's health?
[03:12:16.504 --> 03:12:19.626]  Trump's doctor wrote a letter, and that letter's suspicious.
[03:12:19.666 --> 03:12:28.050]  So, a letter from a personal physician, that's good enough for Hillary, but a letter from Trump's doctor, that's suspicious, that's underhanded, we have to research that.
[03:12:28.330 --> 03:12:31.872]  Remember they said it was sexist to talk about Hillary Clinton's health.
[03:12:32.172 --> 03:12:37.735]  The same media that obsessed about John McCain's health all throughout the 2008 election cycle.
[03:12:37.915 --> 03:12:42.257]  Well let me ask, let me ask your Britannic Majesty this question then.
[03:12:43.953 --> 03:12:44.934]  That's Paul's secret nickname.
[03:12:44.994 --> 03:12:46.175]  I'm going to stop.
[03:12:46.676 --> 03:12:48.958]  Paul, seriously, what do you think is really going on with Hillary?
[03:12:48.978 --> 03:12:51.341]  Because she clearly is degrading fast.
[03:12:51.401 --> 03:12:56.547]  She can't talk 30 seconds without like she's dying.
[03:12:56.587 --> 03:13:02.313]  I mean, that's associated with heart failure, congestive heart failure, and different arrhythmias.
[03:13:02.353 --> 03:13:04.375]  I mean, we showed mainstream news admitting that.
[03:13:04.896 --> 03:13:05.977]  What do you think is going on with Hillary?
[03:13:07.597 --> 03:13:13.281]  I think she had a more severe stroke, and she did have a stroke, than they're admitting to back in 2012.
[03:13:13.341 --> 03:13:22.467]  The fact that they were researching pro-vigil in the Hillary Clinton emails, the leaked emails, shows that they were concerned about Parkinson's.
[03:13:22.487 --> 03:13:24.928]  I mean, she could have early stage Parkinson's.
[03:13:24.968 --> 03:13:26.850]  They could know that she's degenerating.
[03:13:26.870 --> 03:13:28.671]  Yeah, she asked about a Parkinson's drug.
[03:13:28.951 --> 03:13:30.372]  But we should ask that question.
[03:13:31.233 --> 03:13:32.473]  No, that's a conspiracy theory.
[03:13:32.553 --> 03:13:34.895]  Even though it's in the actual emails, it's a conspiracy theory.
[03:13:34.955 --> 03:13:35.475]  Hold on, Paul.
[03:13:35.515 --> 03:13:36.236]  I'm getting a call.
[03:13:38.143 --> 03:13:41.526]  Yes, Vladimir Putin.
[03:13:41.586 --> 03:13:42.787]  Talk about how Hillary's coughing.
[03:13:43.308 --> 03:13:46.391]  Okay, well, oh, you're making her cough from a satellite in space.
[03:13:48.152 --> 03:13:48.873]  Thank you, thank you.
[03:13:49.814 --> 03:13:50.174]  Thank you, sir.
[03:13:50.315 --> 03:13:52.276]  Oh, Vladimir Putin says hi, Paul.
[03:13:52.757 --> 03:13:53.518]  He says good job.
[03:13:54.599 --> 03:13:57.021]  I haven't received that paycheck from the Kremlin yet.
[03:13:57.041 --> 03:13:58.002]  Thank you, Your Excellency.
[03:13:59.597 --> 03:14:03.279]  Listen to this out of the Washington Post though, this is a quote from this article.
[03:14:03.639 --> 03:14:05.360]  Why can't we stop talking about Hillary's health?
[03:14:05.820 --> 03:14:06.041]  Quote,
[03:14:19.733 --> 03:14:27.805]  Right, so they're claiming that to have a four and a half, five minute coughing fit on a regular routine basis is completely normal.
[03:14:27.865 --> 03:14:30.750]  And then to have another one an hour later on the airplane.
[03:14:31.795 --> 03:14:36.180]  Trump has given way more speeches, way more press conferences than Hillary Clinton.
[03:14:36.480 --> 03:14:38.863]  He's never suffered one of these coughing fits.
[03:14:38.903 --> 03:14:40.224]  He's two years older than her.
[03:14:40.605 --> 03:14:42.967]  This is obviously related to a health problem.
[03:14:43.247 --> 03:14:47.532]  You can't claim it's normal and claim that 75% of the country has five minute coughing fits.
[03:14:47.552 --> 03:14:47.872]  Sure, sure.
[03:14:47.893 --> 03:14:49.514]  We're winning this debate.
[03:14:49.534 --> 03:14:50.916]  She obviously's had brain surgery.
[03:14:50.936 --> 03:14:52.538]  The word is the brain tumor was cut out.
[03:14:52.598 --> 03:14:53.238]  It's growing back.
[03:14:54.019 --> 03:14:54.962]  Where do they go from here?
[03:14:55.102 --> 03:14:56.847]  Cain is like creeping around in the background.
[03:14:57.168 --> 03:14:58.732]  Look complete Tim Cain, the senator.
[03:14:58.992 --> 03:15:01.098]  Look completely freaked out during the video in Cleveland.
[03:15:01.359 --> 03:15:02.321]  What do you think is going on, Paul?
[03:15:04.485 --> 03:15:09.209]  Well, obviously it's going to clear the path for Kane to take the top spot if that's what happens.
[03:15:09.749 --> 03:15:14.753]  But now they're coming out and saying that there's not enough pro-Hillary media bias.
[03:15:14.813 --> 03:15:18.696]  I mean, you had that picture yesterday, her sycophants on the plane.
[03:15:19.157 --> 03:15:25.282]  They literally looked like they were enraptured tweens waiting to meet Taylor Swift for the first time.
[03:15:25.442 --> 03:15:28.624]  They looked like starving dogs looking at giant chops of beef.
[03:15:28.804 --> 03:15:28.965]  Yeah.
[03:15:29.741 --> 03:15:34.625]  People go on about Hillary not having a press conference for 275 days on out, whatever it is.
[03:15:35.085 --> 03:15:37.247]  I mean, what good would it really do at this point?
[03:15:37.507 --> 03:15:39.629]  They had chances to ask her questions.
[03:15:39.669 --> 03:15:41.871]  They asked her, they said, how was your weekend?
[03:15:41.911 --> 03:15:44.473]  And then they started talking about Guantanamo Bay.
[03:15:45.033 --> 03:15:48.497]  I mean, you've got all these questions swirling about her emails, her health.
[03:15:48.877 --> 03:15:51.880]  They ask absolutely no relevant questions.
[03:15:52.241 --> 03:15:57.186]  It's no surprise that, you know, 94% of Americans distrust the mainstream media.
[03:15:57.526 --> 03:16:00.249]  And that's why they don't ask real questions.
[03:16:02.503 --> 03:16:07.887]  Paul, I'm going to turn the baton over to you, as I like to say, but first, here's a photo of them fawning.
[03:16:07.907 --> 03:16:12.771]  There's video of it as well, but TV viewers at Infowars.com forward slash show can find that.
[03:16:13.031 --> 03:16:13.952]  What else is coming up today?
[03:16:13.972 --> 03:16:18.055]  I know you've got a big video you've worked hours on today, dealing with Gary Johnson.
[03:16:18.796 --> 03:16:25.220]  I'm telling you, when Gary Johnson was last here, he sat in the corner hissing at me like a gremlin that had been fed after midnight.
[03:16:26.401 --> 03:16:28.763]  I thought he was mentally ill or something.
[03:16:28.783 --> 03:16:31.906]  Other people noticed it, and he basically hissed out of the building.
[03:16:32.756 --> 03:16:34.757]  Like, hopping along or something.
[03:16:35.217 --> 03:16:36.537]  What in the hell is going on?
[03:16:36.577 --> 03:16:39.198]  I mean, again, did somebody feed him after bed time?
[03:16:41.339 --> 03:16:45.440]  Over the past four years, he's basically turned into a social justice warrior, Alex.
[03:16:45.840 --> 03:16:47.761]  You talk about vaccines.
[03:16:47.801 --> 03:16:50.722]  He said the government should have the right to forcibly inject people.
[03:16:50.782 --> 03:16:51.422]  I forgot that.
[03:16:51.462 --> 03:16:59.545]  Forced injections, global government, TPP, open borders, his VP wants to ban guns, he only wants to restrict them, and the Libertarian Party has, uh,
[03:17:00.598 --> 03:17:02.781]  At least, the mainstream media worships him.
[03:17:02.801 --> 03:17:03.422]  What does that tell you?
[03:17:04.643 --> 03:17:05.284]  Well, exactly.
[03:17:05.324 --> 03:17:14.715]  Now you've got all these top celebrities endorsing him and the key point is, you know, in places like Arizona, he could take enough votes away from Trump to hand Hillary a victory.
[03:17:14.755 --> 03:17:17.839]  Gary Johnson is very easily defied.
[03:17:18.160 --> 03:17:19.721]  Enemy of the Republic.
[03:17:21.303 --> 03:17:23.743]  Yeah, he's basically a triggered social justice warrior.
[03:17:23.763 --> 03:17:26.644]  I mean, it wasn't just the illegal immigrant term.
[03:17:26.704 --> 03:17:27.664]  It's basically everything.
[03:17:27.684 --> 03:17:30.105]  His personal behavior is completely bizarre.
[03:17:30.405 --> 03:17:32.985]  He looks like he's smoking too much of the weed.
[03:17:33.005 --> 03:17:34.085]  Hey, I'm telling you, dude.
[03:17:34.125 --> 03:17:35.045]  I'm telling you.
[03:17:35.065 --> 03:17:35.806]  Listen, I'm not exaggerating.
[03:17:35.826 --> 03:17:36.826]  I mean, I've talked about this privately.
[03:17:36.846 --> 03:17:39.566]  I may have even told you, but I've talked off and on for years.
[03:17:39.586 --> 03:17:40.626]  He hadn't been here in almost three years.
[03:17:40.846 --> 03:17:46.207]  Because when he was here, he'd been there many, six, seven, eight times in person, every ten times or more, you know, over the phone.
[03:17:46.788 --> 03:17:49.028]  When he was here, he acted like a freaking lunatic.
[03:17:49.648 --> 03:17:55.730]  And Michael just creeper and I'm going... He seems to... Yeah, go ahead.
[03:17:55.770 --> 03:18:02.512]  He seems to be obsessed about mountain bike riding and calling people pussies while being a complete hypocrite.
[03:18:02.812 --> 03:18:07.573]  He said that Jewish bakeries should be forced to make Nazi wedding cakes.
[03:18:07.953 --> 03:18:09.213]  He wants a carbon tax.
[03:18:09.233 --> 03:18:12.294]  He wants to create a huge onerous government bureaucracy.
[03:18:12.834 --> 03:18:14.995]  He's definitely been let into the Bilderberg.
[03:18:15.235 --> 03:18:16.415]  He's on a power trip.
[03:18:16.916 --> 03:18:18.036]  What a sniveling rat.
[03:18:19.286 --> 03:18:24.329]  And his VP is even worse than a lifelong friend of Hillary Clinton, a complete neocon.
[03:18:24.389 --> 03:18:26.330]  So he's a complete insider now.
[03:18:26.690 --> 03:18:31.132]  And yet there's still a lot of butthurt libertarians that are going to be offended by this video.
[03:18:31.192 --> 03:18:34.133]  No, I think the new definition of Benedict Arnold is Gary Johnson.
[03:18:35.194 --> 03:18:40.877]  He was always just posing as a libertarian to get cred as a little sleeper cell, and now here he is.
[03:18:42.631 --> 03:18:50.233]  And it's worked on a personal level for him, because he's, you know, he's increased his support by about, you know, from, what, 2% to 7, 8, 9%?
[03:18:51.793 --> 03:18:56.294]  So it's worked personally for him, because he's not going to win, but he's going to take enough votes away from Trump.
[03:18:56.674 --> 03:18:57.955]  And he's a complete phony.
[03:18:58.015 --> 03:18:58.395]  He's a fraud.
[03:18:58.415 --> 03:18:59.375]  Well, he's a total operative.
[03:18:59.435 --> 03:19:00.595]  He was ordered here.
[03:19:01.356 --> 03:19:03.076]  He did not like to be here the last time he was here.
[03:19:03.096 --> 03:19:06.377]  And I told Nikko, I said, I don't want everyone to see that guy's face again.
[03:19:07.518 --> 03:19:14.003]  And I'm the one that set him up when he asked to come on, and again, he's just... I never tell stories about how weird somebody is, except for David Duke.
[03:19:14.703 --> 03:19:19.347]  During the breaks, we had him on Skype, and we'd look at him on a big TV, and he'd be like, like, he'd be all, oh, hi!
[03:19:19.887 --> 03:19:22.989]  On air, and then, like, during the break, it was like a robot or something, and I was like, man, that's creepy.
[03:19:23.570 --> 03:19:26.452]  But I'm telling you, Gary Johnson is creepier than David Duke.
[03:19:27.318 --> 03:19:29.360]  I mean, the creep-o-meter is like pegging.
[03:19:29.960 --> 03:19:31.422]  Hey, go ahead and take over.
[03:19:31.602 --> 03:19:33.203]  Skip this break, Watson, as I cut out your time.
[03:19:33.524 --> 03:19:33.844]  Why not?
[03:19:33.884 --> 03:19:34.565]  Just skip everything.
[03:19:35.185 --> 03:19:38.688]  Paul Watson from, I guess you're in France this time, James Bond?
[03:19:39.609 --> 03:19:40.270]  That's right, yep.
[03:19:41.070 --> 03:19:42.532]  The Islamic Caliphate of France.
[03:19:42.672 --> 03:19:44.293]  You need to get someone where they have better internet connections.
[03:19:44.614 --> 03:19:45.795]  Go ahead and take over, Watson.
[03:19:47.782 --> 03:19:53.211]  Well, the video on Gary Johnson is coming up in the second long segment, but we're going to get to that.
[03:19:53.351 --> 03:19:59.962]  And, you know, as Alex was saying, normally I don't prevaricate on people's behaviour, but I include some of that in this video because...
[03:20:00.836 --> 03:20:03.898]  His mannerisms are just absolutely bizarre.
[03:20:03.918 --> 03:20:06.699]  I mean, you talk about Hillary having her seizures.
[03:20:07.099 --> 03:20:09.380]  Gary Johnson is almost on the same level.
[03:20:09.780 --> 03:20:10.881]  But that's a side issue.
[03:20:10.921 --> 03:20:13.322]  The main point is, he's a complete phony.
[03:20:13.362 --> 03:20:14.423]  He can go down the list.
[03:20:14.983 --> 03:20:15.923]  TPP.
[03:20:16.464 --> 03:20:18.725]  OK, you're a libertarian, Gary Johnson.
[03:20:18.745 --> 03:20:20.766]  You're supposed to support small government.
[03:20:21.186 --> 03:20:24.748]  TPP is global government on steroids.
[03:20:24.768 --> 03:20:27.309]  It has nothing whatsoever to do with small government.
[03:20:27.771 --> 03:20:29.192]  You talk about a carbon tax.
[03:20:29.212 --> 03:20:31.194]  He wants to create a carbon tax.
[03:20:31.615 --> 03:20:41.785]  He wants to give the government the power of a massive tax bureaucracy enforced by this centralized gigantic system of oppression and control.
[03:20:41.845 --> 03:20:44.607]  Doesn't sound very libertarian to me.
[03:20:45.368 --> 03:20:50.233]  You know, he's thrown his support behind Black Lives Matter because he's a proto-social justice warrior.
[03:20:50.954 --> 03:20:58.436]  A group whose platform openly, brazenly espouses Marxism, the exact opposite of libertarianism.
[03:20:59.176 --> 03:21:03.798]  You know, they talk about the government owning your children, the community owning your children.
[03:21:04.258 --> 03:21:08.679]  That doesn't sound very individualistic, very libertarian, to me.
[03:21:09.279 --> 03:21:14.781]  So we're going to get on to the Gary Johnson video in the second long segment, but going back to Hillary's health.
[03:21:15.681 --> 03:21:18.842]  Again, this is an article out of the Washington Post, mentioned this briefly.
[03:21:19.818 --> 03:21:34.263]  Now, for years, Media Matters and these admitted White House front groups that meet with President Obama on a weekly basis, they would put out articles whining, being butthurt, about who Matt Drudge linked to.
[03:21:34.923 --> 03:21:37.204]  But I've never really seen it in the Washington Post.
[03:21:37.244 --> 03:21:37.764]  Here it is.
[03:21:37.784 --> 03:21:40.685]  Can we just stop talking about Hillary Clinton's health now?
[03:21:41.105 --> 03:21:43.906]  This is Chris Kilizza of the Washington Post today.
[03:21:44.826 --> 03:21:47.487]  Basically starts whining about the fact that Drudge
[03:21:48.197 --> 03:21:54.180]  Has linked to a lot of headlines about Hillary Clinton's double coughing fit yesterday.
[03:21:54.961 --> 03:21:55.381]  Double.
[03:21:55.941 --> 03:22:08.508]  Now bearing in mind we already had a media cover-up within minutes of this taking place, which we're going to get onto in a second, of them claiming that it was pollen, that it was allergens that caused this.
[03:22:09.388 --> 03:22:16.752]  When pollen and allergens in the region were low, and we proved that, and an outright brazen media lie to try and cover this up,
[03:22:17.759 --> 03:22:24.784]  Well now the Washington Post is extremely offended, extremely triggered by the fact that anyone's talking about it at all.
[03:22:26.505 --> 03:22:28.107]  The article says, This is not new.
[03:22:28.167 --> 03:22:36.793]  Led by drudge, there have been questions circulating in the conservative media and among Trump surrogates like Rudy Giuliani that something is wrong with Clinton for months.
[03:22:37.583 --> 03:22:47.266]  Much of that speculation ties back to an episode in late 2012 in which Clinton caught a stomach virus, fell, suffered a concussion and was then hospitalized due to a blood clot.
[03:22:47.706 --> 03:22:53.588]  And of course much more went on than they admitted to that, given all the medications she's supposedly on.
[03:22:54.949 --> 03:22:58.230]  So then they go on to talk about the fact that now Trump's becoming involved.
[03:22:58.750 --> 03:23:05.432]  Trump tweeted out today, mainstream media never covered Hillary's massive hacking or coughing attack, yet it's number one trending, what's up?
[03:23:06.789 --> 03:23:08.190]  The article continues.
[03:23:08.430 --> 03:23:09.291]  Here's the thing.
[03:23:09.691 --> 03:23:13.053]  This is a totally ridiculous issue for lots of reasons.
[03:23:13.593 --> 03:23:18.836]  And one that if Trump or his Republican surrogates continue to focus on is a surefire loser in the fall.
[03:23:19.357 --> 03:23:20.437]  Yeah, it's a surefire loser.
[03:23:20.457 --> 03:23:24.720]  That's why Hillary Clinton has lost her lead over Trump.
[03:23:24.860 --> 03:23:30.583]  Coincidentally, over the past four weeks when this issue rose to the fore after my video got over four million views.
[03:23:31.564 --> 03:23:33.165]  But again, that's just a coincidence.
[03:23:33.785 --> 03:23:34.766]  Let's start here.
[03:23:35.560 --> 03:23:41.522]  Clinton has released a detailed letter from her personal physician attesting to her overall good health.
[03:23:42.223 --> 03:23:50.966]  Well, her own internist, her own personal physician says that Hillary Clinton is fine, and that's all you need to know.
[03:23:51.906 --> 03:23:54.347]  Again, this is why nobody trusts the mainstream media.
[03:23:54.767 --> 03:24:01.930]  They think that that is investigative journalism to say Hillary Clinton's personal physician says she's fine,
[03:24:02.717 --> 03:24:03.858]  Therefore, it must be true.
[03:24:04.038 --> 03:24:05.960]  No further inquiry is necessary.
[03:24:06.440 --> 03:24:14.487]  Despite the fact that her private emails over and over again reveal that she's interested in all this bizarre cocktail of medications.
[03:24:14.527 --> 03:24:22.634]  You had Dr. Drew come out and say that she was basically receiving treatment that wouldn't have looked out of place in the 1960s.
[03:24:23.615 --> 03:24:29.640]  You've had other prominent doctors, medical experts, neurologists say exactly the same thing, but
[03:24:30.393 --> 03:24:33.096]  They don't mention any of those people in this article.
[03:24:33.416 --> 03:24:41.203]  They don't mention the ten prominent doctors, which is another article linked up on Drudge, that have publicly questioned Hillary's health.
[03:24:41.303 --> 03:24:43.225]  They don't mention a single one.
[03:24:44.206 --> 03:24:48.290]  In fact, remember the media, when this first surfaced a few weeks ago,
[03:24:49.304 --> 03:24:57.067]  Brought out that fake medical document, which we all knew was fake, and none of us who were at the forefront of this issue ever cited it as proof.
[03:24:57.487 --> 03:25:01.569]  But they used that as a straw man to say, oh, look at this fake document.
[03:25:01.909 --> 03:25:04.690]  This is supposedly proof that Hillary Clinton is unwell.
[03:25:05.031 --> 03:25:06.431]  This has been debunked well.
[03:25:07.652 --> 03:25:10.753]  None of us ever cited that document as proof.
[03:25:11.253 --> 03:25:18.196]  These are the lame tactics the media uses to try and assert, to try and claim, to try and dictate reality.
[03:25:18.789 --> 03:25:21.370]  That this whole story has been debunked when it hasn't.
[03:25:21.730 --> 03:25:41.797]  And citing Hillary Clinton's personal position as proof is not objective, independent evidence when you have probably now ten to a dozen health professionals, top doctors, coming out and making the same comments that we've been making for the past five weeks, okay?
[03:25:42.378 --> 03:25:48.500]  You can't just say Hillary's personal position says she's fine and claim that's evidence that the issue's been debunked.
[03:25:49.085 --> 03:25:50.506]  That's not objective.
[03:25:51.627 --> 03:25:56.950]  And in fact, you've had numerous commentators come out and say, just release the full medical records.
[03:25:57.431 --> 03:25:59.652]  Both Trump and Hillary Clinton.
[03:26:00.113 --> 03:26:03.575]  Tell us what medication she's on as of right now.
[03:26:04.876 --> 03:26:07.538]  They say, oh, you're trying to web MD all her symptoms.
[03:26:07.598 --> 03:26:07.898]  No.
[03:26:08.999 --> 03:26:10.120]  I don't know what's wrong with her.
[03:26:10.180 --> 03:26:13.342]  I'm not a doctor, but I know a cover-up when I see it.
[03:26:14.262 --> 03:26:16.464]  And this is what we see today in the Washington Post.
[03:26:17.648 --> 03:26:22.871]  So they cite the letter from Hillary Clinton's personal physician as proof that she's well.
[03:26:23.631 --> 03:26:29.794]  And then they claim that a similar letter from Donald Trump's doctor is completely worthless.
[03:26:30.434 --> 03:26:35.337]  So again, it's good enough for Hillary, but in the same situation, not good enough for Trump.
[03:26:36.497 --> 03:26:37.878]  Again, the article continues.
[03:26:38.538 --> 03:26:43.261]  The simple fact is that there is zero evidence that anything is seriously wrong with Clinton.
[03:26:43.841 --> 03:26:45.662]  If suffering an occasional coughing fit,
[03:26:46.400 --> 03:26:48.342]  Yeah, like a dozen over the past year.
[03:26:49.142 --> 03:26:54.627]  Is evidence of a major health problem, then 75% of the country must have that mystery illness, and I am one of them.
[03:26:55.328 --> 03:27:02.614]  Okay, who suffers prolonged coughing fits that go on for five minutes on a routine basis?
[03:27:03.215 --> 03:27:04.656]  Two in the same day?
[03:27:05.397 --> 03:27:07.499]  Who suffers that and calls it normal?
[03:27:08.119 --> 03:27:13.244]  If you were coughing for five minutes on a routine basis, would you be concerned about your health?
[03:27:14.582 --> 03:27:24.544]  Again, you don't see Donald Trump having five-minute coughing fits where he has to eat lozenges and drink water, looking completely embarrassed in front of an audience.
[03:27:24.844 --> 03:27:25.984]  When have you seen that?
[03:27:26.204 --> 03:27:26.604]  Never!
[03:27:27.344 --> 03:27:27.744]  Never!
[03:27:28.344 --> 03:27:34.946]  Yet he does far more speeches, far more press conferences, than sick Hillary Clinton.
[03:27:35.766 --> 03:27:42.667]  So for the Washington Post to claim that that behaviour is normal, completely asinine,
[03:27:43.673 --> 03:27:47.875]  Manifestly, provably not normal in any situation.
[03:27:48.275 --> 03:27:50.075]  Hasn't happened to Donald Trump.
[03:27:50.536 --> 03:27:54.877]  Hasn't happened to any other politician in recent history.
[03:27:55.317 --> 03:27:56.978]  It's not normal.
[03:27:57.838 --> 03:28:08.042]  So again, they don't even mention the top medical experts, the neurologists that we featured in article after article after article.
[03:28:08.962 --> 03:28:10.523]  Not a single one.
[03:28:11.966 --> 03:28:14.568]  Again, they're focusing on what Drudge is linking to.
[03:28:15.369 --> 03:28:19.792]  He's linking to a story entitled, 10 Doctors Question Hillary Health.
[03:28:21.493 --> 03:28:23.735]  But they don't talk about that in the article.
[03:28:23.915 --> 03:28:28.939]  They talk about Hillary's personal position, writing a note saying she's fine.
[03:28:29.399 --> 03:28:30.740]  And that's the end of the argument.
[03:28:31.961 --> 03:28:33.282]  Again, completely pathetic.
[03:28:34.062 --> 03:28:39.706]  This is why 94% of Americans don't trust the mainstream media.
[03:28:40.006 --> 03:28:45.651]  Because they lie, they cover, they create straw men's over and over again.
[03:28:48.373 --> 03:28:50.574]  Now, in relation to that, we have this article up.
[03:28:50.795 --> 03:28:55.478]  Again, this is up on the Drudge Report and the Washington Post is not happy about the fact that it's linked up there.
[03:28:56.399 --> 03:29:00.582]  Media caught in blatant lie to cover for Hillary's coughing fits.
[03:29:02.332 --> 03:29:13.275]  The mainstream media attempted to dismiss questions over Hillary Clinton's health after her latest round of coughing fits by claiming that pollen counts in the area were high, when in reality they were low.
[03:29:14.015 --> 03:29:22.657]  That's right, they outright fabricated pollen counts to try and blame Hillary's coughing fit on that.
[03:29:23.337 --> 03:29:26.038]  This was MSNBC, I posted the tweet yesterday.
[03:29:27.458 --> 03:29:36.283]  They reported, quote, allergens were high in Northeast Ohio on Monday, before asserting there is no evidence to indicate that Hillary Clinton is unwell.
[03:29:36.923 --> 03:29:47.269]  Again, you go on the weather reports, which are featured in this article, they show grass pollen, tree pollen, ragweed pollen, low, low, moderate.
[03:29:48.289 --> 03:29:53.533]  In none of those cases were pollen counts high, yet the mainstream media lied about it.
[03:29:53.713 --> 03:29:57.136]  They fabricated the story to try and make these questions go away.
[03:29:57.176 --> 03:29:59.017]  We'll be back with the Alex Jones Show live.
[03:29:59.057 --> 03:29:59.798]  We're on the march.
[03:30:00.318 --> 03:30:01.919]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.840 --> 03:30:05.522]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.336 --> 03:30:13.917]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com with an update on unhealthy Hillary.
[03:30:14.097 --> 03:30:16.938]  Hillary Clinton sets conspiracy theories about her health.
[03:30:17.138 --> 03:30:17.898]  Not a concern.
[03:30:18.198 --> 03:30:21.099]  Sorry, but it is not a conspiracy.
[03:30:21.299 --> 03:30:22.439]  You are sick.
[03:30:22.659 --> 03:30:23.859]  You can barely stand up.
[03:30:23.919 --> 03:30:28.040]  You have to get injections by some giant ogre-looking dude to keep going.
[03:30:28.260 --> 03:30:29.701]  You cough uncontrollably.
[03:30:29.921 --> 03:30:30.981]  You can barely even speak.
[03:30:31.101 --> 03:30:31.702]  We're good to go.
[03:30:52.702 --> 03:30:56.265]  Also said she continued to support a no-fly zone over Syria.
[03:30:56.525 --> 03:30:57.105]  Guess what?
[03:30:57.286 --> 03:31:00.128]  You're a no-fly zone because you're a bad person.
[03:31:00.308 --> 03:31:01.529]  No one should be around you.
[03:31:01.669 --> 03:31:05.052]  You should be in a jail cell because you are a f****** criminal.
[03:31:05.192 --> 03:31:07.313]  Stay tuned for more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[03:31:09.980 --> 03:31:14.385]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[03:31:14.465 --> 03:31:25.398]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[03:31:25.578 --> 03:31:30.500]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[03:31:30.620 --> 03:31:33.120]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[03:31:33.180 --> 03:31:34.681]  It helps detoxify.
[03:31:34.901 --> 03:31:37.722]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[03:31:37.782 --> 03:31:42.524]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[03:31:42.564 --> 03:31:46.685]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[03:31:47.105 --> 03:31:48.766]  ...dependent upon selenium.
[03:31:48.786 --> 03:31:54.128]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[03:31:54.228 --> 03:31:55.669]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[03:31:55.849 --> 03:31:56.589]  This is so key.
[03:31:56.849 --> 03:32:01.151]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[03:32:01.171 --> 03:32:03.252]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[03:32:03.392 --> 03:32:06.854]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.

[03:32:11.757 --> 03:32:13.058]  You can't survive without it.
[03:32:13.258 --> 03:32:14.158]  But where do you get it?
[03:32:14.459 --> 03:32:20.223]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[03:32:20.443 --> 03:32:26.168]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[03:32:26.348 --> 03:32:43.219]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[03:32:43.599 --> 03:32:45.741]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[03:32:46.101 --> 03:32:47.302]  Stainless steel construction.
[03:32:47.562 --> 03:32:48.323]  Easy assembly.
[03:32:48.603 --> 03:32:49.244]  Low maintenance.
[03:32:49.524 --> 03:32:51.346]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[03:33:21.037 --> 03:33:23.839]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:24.099 --> 03:33:31.883]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:32.744 --> 03:33:36.946]  We are back live for the fourth hour of The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:36.986 --> 03:33:44.450]  We're going to debut that Gary Johnson video entitled, Gary Johnson is a complete idiot, later on in this segment.
[03:33:44.490 --> 03:33:49.513]  But first I want to tell you about the new preparedness mega specials, Infowarsstore.com.
[03:33:50.342 --> 03:33:59.324]  And again, we're not funded by George Soros, like Black Lives Matter, like a bunch of so-called independent media outlets that aren't independent at all.
[03:33:59.804 --> 03:34:02.505]  We're not funded by giant pharmaceutical companies.
[03:34:02.945 --> 03:34:04.885]  We're funded by you, the listener.
[03:34:05.465 --> 03:34:09.526]  And right now, we have new preparedness mega-specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:34:10.226 --> 03:34:18.768]  To celebrate National Preparedness Month, we're giving you up to 40% off, 40% off our top-selling preparedness items at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:34:50.833 --> 03:34:57.594]  With Hillary Clinton trying to push for nuclear war with Russia, maybe it's a good idea to start getting prepared.
[03:34:58.254 --> 03:35:01.215]  With the products at InfoWarsStore.com again.
[03:35:02.055 --> 03:35:04.936]  That storable food discount up to 40% off.
[03:35:05.196 --> 03:35:08.317]  Massive savings at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:35:08.757 --> 03:35:10.137]  It helps us build the platform.
[03:35:10.437 --> 03:35:15.218]  It helps us send reporters out to challenge the lamestream media directly.
[03:35:16.027 --> 03:35:26.449]  The same lamestream media that gets on a plane with Hillary Clinton has the chance to actually ask her a real question for the first time in months.
[03:35:26.649 --> 03:35:27.669]  And what did they ask her?
[03:35:28.689 --> 03:35:30.029]  How was your weekend?
[03:35:30.970 --> 03:35:32.450]  Absolutely pathetic.
[03:35:32.830 --> 03:35:36.130]  Look at their faces in the photo that we posted.
[03:35:36.751 --> 03:35:44.132]  This is the esteemed mainstream media with 6% trust amongst Americans right now.
[03:35:44.212 --> 03:35:45.412]  Take a look at that photo.
[03:35:46.192 --> 03:35:47.733]  Do they look inquisitive?
[03:35:47.833 --> 03:35:55.520]  Do they look like they're about to ask the hard questions to get to the core of the real issues that the American people want to hear about?
[03:35:55.820 --> 03:35:56.021]  No.
[03:35:56.381 --> 03:36:03.607]  They look like enraptured tween Taylor Swift fans about to meet their idol for the first time.
[03:36:04.067 --> 03:36:07.971]  This is the castrated, pathetic corporate media.
[03:36:08.715 --> 03:36:17.338]  And then they have the temerity to whine about Breitbart, about the Drudge Report, about Infowars.com, about how much we've grown.
[03:36:18.018 --> 03:36:21.320]  Well, when that's the competition, obviously we're going to grow.
[03:36:22.880 --> 03:36:23.961]  Absolutely pathetic.
[03:36:24.001 --> 03:36:25.461]  So they were caught in another lie.
[03:36:26.522 --> 03:36:33.464]  Claimed that Hillary was coughing because allergens in the area were very high in Northeast Ohio.
[03:36:34.044 --> 03:36:35.505]  Absolute BS.
[03:36:36.283 --> 03:36:37.925]  We went through the weather reports.
[03:36:38.525 --> 03:36:40.687]  Every single pollen count was low.
[03:36:41.248 --> 03:36:42.589]  The highest one was moderate.
[03:36:42.709 --> 03:36:44.231]  Most of them were low.
[03:36:45.172 --> 03:36:47.654]  They invented this story out of whole cloth.
[03:36:48.475 --> 03:36:52.379]  Calling people who question Hillary's health sexist didn't work.
[03:36:52.900 --> 03:36:56.583]  We pointed out that the media was obsessed about John McCain's health back in 2008.
[03:36:57.544 --> 03:37:00.167]  Then they tried to claim it was a huge conspiracy theory.
[03:37:00.757 --> 03:37:05.321]  Invented by the right-wing conspiracy machine once again.
[03:37:05.742 --> 03:37:13.348]  That failed when you had prominent doctors come out and make the same points, even though they never mentioned them in the article.
[03:37:14.009 --> 03:37:17.592]  Now they're just resorting to inventing crap out of thin air!
[03:37:18.753 --> 03:37:24.098]  It's absolutely bizarre, while claiming that this is doing nothing whatsoever to harm
[03:37:24.847 --> 03:37:33.270]  Hillary Clinton's electability, while she's lost her lead over Donald Trump, just coincidentally, since this issue came to the fore.
[03:37:34.970 --> 03:37:48.194]  Again, in her ridiculous alt-right speech, Hillary Clinton invoking this health issue once again, while pandering her own bizarre conspiracy theories about Vladimir Putin being in control of everything.
[03:37:49.335 --> 03:37:51.195]  But we're going to get back into that after this.
[03:37:51.295 --> 03:37:53.716]  First, I want to go to the video
[03:37:54.520 --> 03:37:57.881]  That went up on Infowars.com just a few hours ago.
[03:37:59.082 --> 03:38:04.384]  And this is talking about Gary Johnson, of course, the Libertarian Party candidate for President.
[03:38:04.544 --> 03:38:10.067]  Why are we talking about Gary Johnson when he has absolutely no chance whatsoever of winning the Presidency?
[03:38:11.347 --> 03:38:22.752]  Well, in places like Arizona, he could take away enough votes from Donald Trump to have a very real effect on the outcome of the Presidential Election.
[03:38:23.706 --> 03:38:24.826]  This is why it's important.
[03:38:24.846 --> 03:38:26.327]  This is out of the Chicago Tribune.
[03:38:26.867 --> 03:38:30.509]  In Arizona, Gary Johnson could play spoiler in presidential elections.
[03:38:30.769 --> 03:38:31.969]  Well, isn't that interesting?
[03:38:32.770 --> 03:38:42.033]  I had a bunch of libertarians on my Facebook page claim that Johnson is only going to take away votes from Hillary Clinton, so why am I even making this point?
[03:38:42.073 --> 03:38:44.234]  Well, that's completely wrong!
[03:38:45.433 --> 03:38:55.697]  From the article, if Hillary Clinton carries Arizona in November, there's a good chance it won't be because Democrats on their own have flipped a reliable GOP state they hope to win consistently someday.
[03:38:56.317 --> 03:39:01.719]  Instead, Clinton and Democrats may have Gary Johnson to thank.
[03:39:02.300 --> 03:39:13.084]  The Libertarian Party nominee's best chance to influence the presidential race may come in Arizona, where the former New Mexico governor appeals to a group of finicky conservatives who make up part of the GOP base.
[03:39:13.991 --> 03:39:16.372]  It could happen, said GOP Senator Jeff Flake.
[03:39:16.873 --> 03:39:22.996]  Donald Trump has managed to make this an interesting state in terms of presidential politics and not in the way Republicans have wanted.
[03:39:24.037 --> 03:39:30.161]  Johnson is an easy out for some people in our party, Flake told the Associated Press.
[03:39:30.821 --> 03:39:31.822]  So there you go.
[03:39:32.162 --> 03:39:36.865]  He's going to take away votes from Donald Trump in key battleground states.
[03:39:37.885 --> 03:39:40.967]  Again, that's going to cost him the election up against Hillary Clinton.
[03:39:41.641 --> 03:39:52.689]  That's why talking about Gary Johnson right at this moment, after all these ridiculous faux pas he's been caught in, is a very central core issue.
[03:39:53.149 --> 03:39:54.070]  Now here's the video.
[03:39:54.650 --> 03:39:55.551]  It's up on YouTube.
[03:39:55.631 --> 03:39:56.331]  Please share it.
[03:39:56.451 --> 03:39:57.592]  Please get it out to people.
[03:39:58.092 --> 03:40:00.654]  Gary Johnson is a complete idiot.
[03:40:00.714 --> 03:40:01.535]  Let's play the clip.
[03:40:02.625 --> 03:40:06.907]  With the polls tightening, it looks like this presidential race could be really close.
[03:40:07.167 --> 03:40:17.513]  Although he has zero chance of winning, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson could take enough votes away from Trump in key states to ensure a Hillary Clinton victory.
[03:40:17.973 --> 03:40:23.836]  Now that wouldn't be an issue for me if Johnson were a principled Libertarian candidate.
[03:40:24.096 --> 03:40:24.897]  But he isn't.
[03:40:25.157 --> 03:40:28.259]  He's a total fraud and a complete idiot.
[03:40:28.379 --> 03:40:39.789]  Gary Johnson, the so-called small government libertarian, wants to give the government the power to forcibly inject your children at gunpoint if necessary.
[03:40:40.109 --> 03:40:41.990]  That's not libertarian.
[03:40:42.210 --> 03:40:45.833]  You see, there's something called the non-aggression principle, Gary.
[03:40:46.154 --> 03:40:47.535]  Don't know if you've heard of it.
[03:40:47.955 --> 03:40:52.200]  Yeah, it's basically the bedrock of libertarian values.
[03:40:52.480 --> 03:40:53.922]  Might be worth googling.
[03:40:54.242 --> 03:41:00.449]  During a recent CNBC interview, Johnson said he was open to supporting a carbon tax.
[03:41:01.052 --> 03:41:06.633]  Well, I do think that climate change is occurring, and it is man-caused.
[03:41:06.673 --> 03:41:16.296]  One of the proposals that I think is a very libertarian proposal, and I'm just open to this, is taxing carbon emissions.
[03:41:16.356 --> 03:41:27.539]  Right, so the so-called small government libertarian wants to implement a massive government taxing scheme enforced by a gigantic, onerous, centralized bureaucracy.
[03:41:27.799 --> 03:41:29.261]  That's not libertarian!
[03:41:29.381 --> 03:41:41.656]  The so-called small-government libertarian wants to give the government the power to shut down bakeries that refuse to make gay wedding cakes, violating his own libertarian party's platform!
[03:41:42.077 --> 03:41:43.478]  That's not libertarian!
[03:41:43.618 --> 03:41:47.183]  Because a Jewish baker should have to bake the cake for the Nazi wedding.
[03:41:47.523 --> 03:41:49.925]  That would be my contention, yes.
[03:41:49.945 --> 03:41:58.693]  The so-called Libertarian supports Black Lives Matter, a group whose public platform has all the specific hallmarks of Marxism.
[03:41:59.153 --> 03:42:02.436]  The exact opposite of Libertarianism.
[03:42:02.916 --> 03:42:04.418]  That's not Libertarian.
[03:42:04.838 --> 03:42:11.564]  Johnson supports the TPP, a globalist trade deal that even Hillary Clinton had to back away from.
[03:42:11.684 --> 03:42:17.746]  Would you withdraw from the TPP on your first day in office and unconditionally rule out its passage in any form?
[03:42:18.506 --> 03:42:27.208]  I'm being told that the Trans-Pacific Partnership would in fact advance free trade and so I would support that document.
[03:42:27.288 --> 03:42:33.030]  TPP is not just big government, it's global government on steroids.
[03:42:33.630 --> 03:42:35.091]  That's not libertarian.
[03:42:35.171 --> 03:42:39.572]  He also wants to admit tens of thousands of Muslim migrants into America because
[03:42:39.932 --> 03:42:42.314]  That worked out great for Germany, didn't it?
[03:42:42.594 --> 03:42:48.238]  Terror attacks virtually every week, mass molestations of women, rampant criminality.
[03:42:48.678 --> 03:42:52.060]  Sounds like a violation of the non-aggression principle to me.
[03:42:52.781 --> 03:42:54.382]  And that's not libertarian.
[03:42:54.642 --> 03:43:04.329]  As governor of New Mexico, Johnson, the so-called fiscal libertarian, inherited a debt of 1.8 billion dollars and left a debt
[03:43:05.089 --> 03:43:07.610]  Of 4.6 billion dollars.
[03:43:08.090 --> 03:43:09.511]  That's not libertarian.
[03:43:09.791 --> 03:43:12.312]  Gary Johnson isn't a libertarian.
[03:43:12.572 --> 03:43:16.493]  He's a social justice warrior posing as a libertarian.
[03:43:16.773 --> 03:43:18.094]  He's a phony.
[03:43:18.354 --> 03:43:24.136]  He even gets triggered like an SJW when people use the term illegal immigrant.
[03:43:24.436 --> 03:43:26.917]  Millions of adult illegal immigrants who are here
[03:43:28.598 --> 03:43:29.798]  Undocumented, by the way.
[03:43:29.838 --> 03:43:36.883]  If you use the term illegal immigrants, that is very incendiary to our Hispanic population here in this country.
[03:43:36.943 --> 03:43:37.483]  Why is that?
[03:43:37.863 --> 03:43:38.504]  It just is.
[03:43:38.924 --> 03:43:39.545]  It just is.
[03:43:39.685 --> 03:43:40.525]  Just so that you know.
[03:43:41.026 --> 03:43:43.247]  Just so that you know and you don't have to use that term.
[03:43:43.387 --> 03:43:50.392]  But isn't the term accurate in the sense that they entered the country, they immigrated to the country illegally?
[03:43:50.432 --> 03:43:57.298]  They came into this country because they couldn't get in legally and the jobs existed.
[03:43:57.738 --> 03:44:00.120]  And you or I would have done the same thing.
[03:44:00.460 --> 03:44:07.726]  And we're talking about now, coming from New Mexico, a population with 48% Hispanic, how's the crackdown
[03:44:08.226 --> 03:44:11.789]  An 11 million undocumented workers going to work out.
[03:44:12.209 --> 03:44:14.510]  It's going to be dragging people from their homes.
[03:44:14.571 --> 03:44:15.911]  That's how it's going to work out.
[03:44:16.272 --> 03:44:19.554]  It's going to be checking your papers house to house.
[03:44:19.934 --> 03:44:25.938]  And I got to tell you what Donald Trump is saying regarding immigration could not be more incendiary.
[03:44:26.379 --> 03:44:29.321]  It is insulting to me coming from New Mexico.
[03:44:30.552 --> 03:44:36.737]  Isn't it, though, unfair to compare, let's say, everything that Donald Trump's saying to simply using the term illegal immigrant?
[03:44:37.157 --> 03:44:40.199]  I mean, if I were... Undocumented.
[03:44:40.380 --> 03:44:41.020]  It just is.
[03:44:41.440 --> 03:44:42.061]  It just is.
[03:44:42.221 --> 03:44:43.082]  Just so that you know.
[03:44:43.242 --> 03:44:45.563]  Well, just so that you know, Gary!
[03:44:45.884 --> 03:44:52.829]  Policing language and censoring words in the name of pandering to political correctness, that's not libertarian.
[03:44:53.009 --> 03:44:57.733]  He thinks calling someone a racist over and over again constitutes an argument.
[03:44:58.073 --> 03:44:59.174]  Newsflash, Gary!
[03:44:59.694 --> 03:45:00.354]  It doesn't!
[03:45:00.795 --> 03:45:01.355]  Racist.
[03:45:01.675 --> 03:45:02.796]  It's just racist.
[03:45:03.036 --> 03:45:06.918]  He thinks crooked Hillary is a wonderful public servant.
[03:45:07.339 --> 03:45:07.859]  Hillary Clinton.
[03:45:11.441 --> 03:45:12.802]  Hillary Clinton.
[03:45:14.443 --> 03:45:15.963]  A wonderful public servant.
[03:45:16.204 --> 03:45:21.367]  On what planet does that comment resonate with any libertarian?
[03:45:21.727 --> 03:45:22.907]  I mean, just look at the guy.
[03:45:22.988 --> 03:45:25.269]  Who makes expressions like this?
[03:45:25.709 --> 03:45:27.770]  What the hell is wrong with him?
[03:45:28.071 --> 03:45:32.634]  On a personal level, Gary Johnson is also a complete a**hole.
[03:45:32.934 --> 03:45:42.541]  After being presented with a replica of George Washington's pistol by his tearful campaign rival, Johnson immediately tossed it in the trash.
[03:45:42.901 --> 03:45:43.862]  What a d***!
[03:45:44.762 --> 03:45:56.770]  Johnson's running mate is Bill Weld, a neocon who supported the invasion of Iraq, backed gun control measures, endorsed Barack Obama, and is a longtime personal friend of, you guessed it, Hillary Clinton.
[03:45:57.330 --> 03:45:59.512]  And none of that is very libertarian.
[03:45:59.772 --> 03:46:04.855]  There's never been a more unpopular set of major party candidates than ever before.
[03:46:05.175 --> 03:46:06.056]  You'd think this.
[03:46:06.516 --> 03:46:15.001]  would be the year above all others for the Libertarian Party to make a huge impression in promoting real libertarian values.
[03:46:15.401 --> 03:46:15.921]  But no.
[03:46:16.522 --> 03:46:24.406]  Instead they've chosen to select a complete clown who permanently looks like he's about to break out into a childish temper tantrum.
[03:46:24.626 --> 03:46:25.887]  A half-wit who
[03:46:25.947 --> 03:46:26.087]  Racist!
[03:46:26.107 --> 03:46:26.728]  It's just racist!
[03:46:52.481 --> 03:46:56.784]  That video is up on YouTube and it's on Infowars.com.
[03:46:56.824 --> 03:46:58.685]  Gary Johnson is a complete idiot.
[03:46:59.286 --> 03:47:09.173]  Please share that, please get that out because I said it's very important to emphasize the fact that Johnson could take away votes from Trump in key battleground states like Arizona.
[03:47:10.113 --> 03:47:19.140]  Even though he's completely abandoned all his so-called principles since 2012, he's vastly increased his support base.
[03:47:19.904 --> 03:47:20.945]  Since four years ago.
[03:47:21.005 --> 03:47:26.309]  So he's going to have an instrumental effect, an instrumental impact on this presidential election.
[03:47:26.950 --> 03:47:41.942]  Now if you had like a Ron Paul figure, again, running as a third party in this election, pointing out that he was a real libertarian candidate, had real consistent libertarian principles, I would have absolutely no problem with that.
[03:47:42.062 --> 03:47:44.684]  And I would probably support him over Donald Trump.
[03:47:45.205 --> 03:47:46.746]  In fact, I supported Rand Paul
[03:47:47.409 --> 03:47:51.232]  Before I supported Donald Trump, and in favour of Donald Trump.
[03:47:51.672 --> 03:48:02.959]  So if you had a real genuine candidate, an actual libertarian, with real libertarian values, who was consistent and stuck to them, I would have absolutely no problem with that, and would support it 100%.
[03:48:03.379 --> 03:48:07.842]  But as you saw in the video, you can go down the list.
[03:48:08.343 --> 03:48:09.263]  TPP.
[03:48:09.743 --> 03:48:10.844]  Carbon taxes.
[03:48:11.385 --> 03:48:14.086]  Forced mandatory vaccinations.
[03:48:14.587 --> 03:48:14.947]  Debt.
[03:48:15.945 --> 03:48:21.287]  Support for fringe, left-wing, extremist, violent groups like Black Lives Matter.
[03:48:22.407 --> 03:48:23.448]  All of these issues.
[03:48:24.208 --> 03:48:25.128]  Mass immigration.
[03:48:25.468 --> 03:48:26.789]  Policing language.
[03:48:27.289 --> 03:48:32.071]  What kind of libertarian tries to police what words people can use, for God's sake?
[03:48:33.071 --> 03:48:35.392]  I mean, what happened to the Libertarian Party?
[03:48:36.152 --> 03:48:37.232]  We saw it in Canada.
[03:48:37.252 --> 03:48:44.635]  I mean, they kicked out Lauren Southern, they kicked her out of the party for retweeting one of my videos because they found it offensive.
[03:48:46.232 --> 03:48:49.034]  Where did this SJW strain come from?
[03:48:49.794 --> 03:48:51.856]  It's infected the Libertarian Party.
[03:48:52.536 --> 03:48:54.858]  And it's characterised by Gary Johnson.
[03:48:55.218 --> 03:48:56.799]  A complete fraud.
[03:48:57.220 --> 03:48:57.900]  A phony.
[03:48:58.520 --> 03:49:03.444]  And the prime reason why I had to stop identifying as a Libertarian.
[03:49:04.344 --> 03:49:09.528]  Because he's a terrible, awful ambassador for that term.
[03:49:10.389 --> 03:49:12.170]  And that's why nobody should vote for him.
[03:49:12.650 --> 03:49:13.811]  Don't vote for anybody.
[03:49:14.585 --> 03:49:19.246]  If you really hate Trump and Hillary on an equal footing, just don't vote for anybody.
[03:49:19.966 --> 03:49:28.008]  Because voting for Gary Johnson, you're just betraying your own principles because he betrayed his a long time ago.
[03:49:29.148 --> 03:49:30.248]  So get that video out.
[03:49:30.928 --> 03:49:32.849]  Again, it's up on Infowars.com and YouTube.
[03:49:33.649 --> 03:49:35.869]  Gary Johnson is a complete idiot!
[03:49:37.170 --> 03:49:40.910]  Now moving back to some of the news stories here, we've covered Hillary's health.
[03:49:42.151 --> 03:49:43.691]  Earlier today in the UK we had
[03:49:44.321 --> 03:49:46.183]  A Black Lives Matter protest?
[03:49:46.323 --> 03:49:56.693]  Now, when I say the words Black Lives Matter, I actually mean six white middle-class hipster trendies representing black people in their own words.
[03:49:57.594 --> 03:50:00.517]  They basically got a dinghy, they sailed out onto
[03:50:01.098 --> 03:50:08.483]  onto the River Thames, snuck onto the tarmac at London City Airport, and basically caused huge delays.
[03:50:08.943 --> 03:50:14.567]  They were messing around with aircraft, basically giving ISIS ideas on how to attack a major airport.
[03:50:14.847 --> 03:50:15.628]  Well done there.
[03:50:16.909 --> 03:50:20.091]  All to make the point that air pollution is racist.
[03:50:20.851 --> 03:50:30.378]  That's right, that's your new racist thing for today is air pollution, because this airport is located next to poor areas of London.
[03:50:31.582 --> 03:50:35.785]  Okay, one of the biggest airports in the world is Heathrow Airport.
[03:50:36.206 --> 03:50:47.154]  That's located next to places like Richmond, Kew and Brentford, which are amongst the wealthiest, whitest areas in the entire country.
[03:50:47.574 --> 03:50:53.539]  So air pollution is racist at London City Airport because it's near poor areas where black people live.
[03:50:55.146 --> 03:51:01.029]  And yet we have one of the biggest airports in the world, Heathrow, located in extremely white, wealthy areas.
[03:51:01.169 --> 03:51:02.630]  Is that racist too?
[03:51:02.970 --> 03:51:04.751]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[03:51:04.771 --> 03:51:07.172]  We'll be back with the final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:51:07.513 --> 03:51:08.193]  Don't go away.
[03:51:12.555 --> 03:51:16.837]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[03:51:19.539 --> 03:51:21.020]  Americanism, not globalism!
[03:51:21.040 --> 03:51:21.680]  Americanism, not globalism!
[03:51:24.901 --> 03:51:28.944]  The era of economic surrender will finally be over.
[03:51:29.264 --> 03:51:35.368]  We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
[03:51:35.728 --> 03:51:43.232]  They have gotten the political establishment and the media establishment to become pure, wanton henchmen of totalitarianism.
[03:51:43.593 --> 03:51:51.978]  If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda.
[03:51:52.418 --> 03:51:54.959]  I think what the Chinese have done is really smart.
[03:51:55.479 --> 03:52:06.122]  The skyscrapers went up in Beijing and many other cities around the world, while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled right here in Detroit.
[03:52:06.662 --> 03:52:12.324]  It's all training us to accept less, lowering expectations, a post-industrial world, a new dark age.
[03:52:12.444 --> 03:52:16.285]  That's what the UN Biological Diversity Assessment 1996 calls for.
[03:52:16.525 --> 03:52:19.946]  When we abandon the policy of America first,
[03:52:20.786 --> 03:52:24.789]  We started rebuilding other countries instead of our own.
[03:52:25.189 --> 03:52:29.312]  Not a world, Winston, that gets more beautiful and more technological and stronger.
[03:52:29.572 --> 03:52:32.354]  A world that gets uglier and stupider and more stunted.
[03:52:34.615 --> 03:52:39.218]  The government should allow Hillary Clinton to become President of the United States.
[03:52:39.718 --> 03:52:41.440]  I voted for Hillary Clinton.
[03:52:41.740 --> 03:52:42.800]  Well, I voted for Hillary.
[03:52:43.041 --> 03:52:45.062]  I guess I have to since I'm working for her as well.
[03:52:45.362 --> 03:52:47.284]  You want an image of the future, Winston?
[03:52:47.484 --> 03:52:49.666]  It's a boot stomping on a human face forever.
[03:52:49.726 --> 03:52:56.053]  Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.
[03:52:56.393 --> 03:53:00.837]  Women are treated, discriminated against in all these countries she took money against.
[03:53:01.198 --> 03:53:04.681]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely.
[03:53:04.741 --> 03:53:05.622]  They're mistreated.
[03:53:06.303 --> 03:53:07.624]  She claims to be their champion.
[03:53:08.044 --> 03:53:16.647]  Don't look at me, Winston, and see the black circles around my eyes, and see how ugly and weak I am, expressing myself and dying, and I torture people 18 hours a day, and I have a horrible life!
[03:53:16.867 --> 03:53:21.208]  That's the beauty of the satanic evil of the priest of power ripping apart humanity!
[03:53:21.308 --> 03:53:22.508]  We're here to hurt humans!
[03:53:22.608 --> 03:53:24.109]  We're here to suck your guts out!
[03:53:40.091 --> 03:53:41.972]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[03:53:42.032 --> 03:53:43.914]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[03:53:43.994 --> 03:53:46.716]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[03:53:46.936 --> 03:53:47.736]  Alex Jones.
[03:53:47.837 --> 03:53:50.578]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[03:53:50.638 --> 03:53:53.861]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[03:53:53.881 --> 03:53:55.202]  Deeply I think racist.
[03:53:55.302 --> 03:53:57.143]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[03:53:57.263 --> 03:53:59.064]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[03:53:59.084 --> 03:54:03.147]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[03:54:03.167 --> 03:54:04.328]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:04.408 --> 03:54:09.332]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:54:21.360 --> 03:54:24.402]  We're back for the final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:25.063 --> 03:54:27.645]  Some more things that are now officially racist.
[03:54:27.745 --> 03:54:33.369]  In case you didn't know, this is according to the Chief Diversity Officer at Clark University.
[03:54:34.250 --> 03:54:38.753]  Asking Asian people to help you with maths, that's racist.
[03:54:39.473 --> 03:54:43.456]  Talking to black people about basketball, that's now racist.
[03:54:43.496 --> 03:54:46.879]  That's a microaggression and it's not allowed.
[03:54:48.055 --> 03:54:53.117]  UMass says that Harambe memes are now officially racist.
[03:54:54.097 --> 03:55:03.301]  Now I saw, I think it was UT Texas Longhorn fans in a video using this Harambe meme, so I thought at that point, well, it's pretty much done.
[03:55:03.901 --> 03:55:05.022]  It's pretty much dead.
[03:55:05.482 --> 03:55:07.603]  Those people aren't the sharpest knives in the drawer.
[03:55:08.823 --> 03:55:17.307]  So, I officially announced the death of the Harambe meme, but now that UMass is saying that the Harambe meme is racist, I think it's time to bring it back.
[03:55:17.347 --> 03:55:17.607]  And again,
[03:55:18.288 --> 03:55:23.830]  It's like when people get upset and offended about me using the word retard on Twitter.
[03:55:24.850 --> 03:55:30.593]  Now obviously when I use the word retard I'm not talking about disabled children.
[03:55:31.013 --> 03:55:39.796]  And in fact it only reflects on them if they think that me using the word retard is an insult to children with Down Syndrome.
[03:55:40.496 --> 03:55:41.577]  That's in their head.
[03:55:41.657 --> 03:55:45.238]  That's never in my head when I use words like retard.
[03:55:45.965 --> 03:56:06.090]  So now the people, again, this is probably white, hipster, university types, again, the bigotry of low expectations, thinking that black people can't handle a fun, jokey, internet meme about a dead gorilla, saying that it's racist against black people and it's got nothing whatsoever to do with that.
[03:56:06.510 --> 03:56:09.291]  Again, they're the racists for making that connection.
[03:56:10.011 --> 03:56:12.852]  So again, they're saying that you can't use the Harambee meme anymore.
[03:56:13.556 --> 03:56:15.718]  That officially means it's resurrected.
[03:56:15.818 --> 03:56:18.540]  Hashtag justice for Harambee.
[03:56:18.880 --> 03:56:21.122]  We need more Harambee memes.
[03:56:22.083 --> 03:56:23.965]  Let's get into some final news stories here.
[03:56:25.085 --> 03:56:29.349]  Again, this is out of brightbot.com, talking about the internet takeover.
[03:56:29.989 --> 03:56:32.572]  Obama, internet cannot be like Wild Wild West.
[03:56:33.212 --> 03:56:40.318]  President Obama called for a series of international agreements to regulate activity on the internet, citing his preference not to start an arms race in cyberspace.
[03:56:40.871 --> 03:56:50.215]  What we cannot do is have a situation in which suddenly this becomes the Wild Wild West, President Obama said during a press conference in China on Monday after the G20 Summit.
[03:56:51.616 --> 03:57:04.442]  Now you could take those words and substitute President Barack Obama to any third world dictator who has used the very same justification for shutting down the internet.
[03:57:04.502 --> 03:57:07.564]  We saw it in China ongoing for years.
[03:57:07.884 --> 03:57:10.165]  Every time they have civil unrest,
[03:57:10.728 --> 03:57:25.065]  People protesting against the authorities, against the police, they come out and say, for stability, for safety, for security, we need to shut down the internet because it's becoming too wild, even though
[03:57:25.726 --> 03:57:34.633]  That exact thing is what made the Internet so great, so free-flowing, so dynamic in the first place.
[03:57:35.193 --> 03:57:54.869]  So you've got Obama directly invoking the rhetoric of third world dictators when it comes to shutting down the Internet, saying that America faces cyber attacks, but on the other hand then saying that, quote, we've got more capacity than anybody, both offensively and defensively, when it comes to cyber attacks.
[03:57:55.515 --> 03:58:01.961]  So we need to shut down the internet because of cyber attacks, but on the other hand, we're the best at carrying out cyber attacks.
[03:58:02.782 --> 03:58:04.384]  That's what Obama said today.
[03:58:05.505 --> 03:58:08.268]  More cultural enrichment news, this is out of the Daily Mail.
[03:58:09.149 --> 03:58:14.374]  Six Afghan and Iraqi migrants are arrested, eight women are sexually assaulted at Austrian festival.
[03:58:15.336 --> 03:58:16.957]  Again, they lied about their age.
[03:58:17.077 --> 03:58:20.198]  They claimed to be 15, so they wouldn't be deported.
[03:58:20.678 --> 03:58:23.319]  This has happened over and over again, as we said it would.
[03:58:23.719 --> 03:58:29.481]  Multiple times in Sweden, every single festival they have, there's mass molestation of women.
[03:58:30.361 --> 03:58:33.002]  This is a really bad situation.
[03:58:33.363 --> 03:58:34.763]  Merkel's losing support.
[03:58:35.103 --> 03:58:39.905]  And things are going to change, otherwise there's going to be wider civil unrest throughout Europe.
[03:58:41.041 --> 03:58:43.642]  That's gonna wrap it up for this edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:58:43.923 --> 03:58:45.744]  Stay tuned tonight for InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:58:45.844 --> 03:58:47.084]  Alex will be back tomorrow.

[03:59:00.623 --> 03:59:02.627]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[03:59:02.647 --> 03:59:05.432]  Conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly dead at 92.
[03:59:06.013 --> 03:59:08.958]  She is and was an icon of human liberty said Alex Jones.
[03:59:09.318 --> 03:59:11.302]  Without trailblazers like her we would have no
