[00:00:20.598 --> 00:00:22.640]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.961]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:24.281 --> 00:00:28.224]  It is July 13th, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:30.385 --> 00:00:35.089]  There's no doubt that our country is in serious trouble right now.
[00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:40.715]  And if you're wondering how on earth we ever got in this situation, well I'll tell you how.
[00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:46.739]  When the Democrats showed their true colors, you got angry and you elected Republicans.
[00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.504]  And then when the Republicans showed their true colors, you got angry and elected Democrats.
[00:00:52.944 --> 00:01:03.030]  And when anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt and that neither side were looking out for your best interest, you acted like they were crazy.
[00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:11.295]  But the real definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
[00:01:11.815 --> 00:01:17.704]  That's why it is vitally important that you wake up, America, and break the matrix.
[00:01:18.085 --> 00:01:23.012]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and the Alex Jones Show.
[00:01:23.453 --> 00:01:25.856]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:02.377]  Hi, I'm Dr. David Jones.
[00:02:02.478 --> 00:02:05.420]  I've been in practice for over 30 years in dentistry.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.444]  In our health histories, we've always asked what people's primary complaint were.
[00:02:09.464 --> 00:02:12.006]  A third of the time, it's, I want whiter teeth.
[00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:26.279]  In the early days of dentistry, we used some fairly harsh chemicals in order to bleach the teeth and whiten them, and people were happy with the results, even though it created hypersensitivity and some problems that I consider fairly high risk.
[00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.901]  Recently, I was exposed to the Ghost Smile System.
[00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:36.324]  It allows a whitening gel to be applied to the teeth with a very good ultrasonic toothbrush system.
[00:02:36.484 --> 00:02:51.691]  The gel is activated by a light-emitting diode, or actually two light-emitting diodes, so it's a simple and elegant procedure that delivers office-quality whitening, and you don't have to spend the $600 it typically costs for an in-office treatment.
[00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:55.798]  In my opinion, it's the most elegant and best value that I've ever seen.
[00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.826]  To get your GoSmile system, go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:03:02.244 --> 00:03:04.625]  We're going to start off our news tonight by talking about guns.
[00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:06.786]  I know you're quite surprised I can see it on your face.
[00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:08.986]  But I want to talk about guns in a different aspect.
[00:03:09.067 --> 00:03:17.169]  And this is the way people are reacting to the firearms, you know, the anti-gun groups, the celebrities who come out and speak about firearms.
[00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.890]  And we'll get to all that here in a second.
[00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.533]  But first of all, we're going to start with this video, the new video from Project Veritas, James O'Keefe and his crew over there.
[00:03:26.053 --> 00:03:28.714]  And they've done another great video where they go out to the
[00:03:29.454 --> 00:03:36.801]  Pundits, they go out to these congressmen, these senators, everybody who wants to take your gun rights away and they just ask them a very simple question.
[00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:45.590]  They say, well, since you're so keen on taking gun rights away and you think that nobody should be armed, why don't you advertise the fact that your house is a gun-free zone?
[00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:58.498]  And if you remember the one he did previously about the, I believe it was a group up in New York, a news agency who was putting out the information of gun owners as if they were sex offenders, like, hey, look at this, this map with all the dots on it.
[00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:00.820]  And the people were very upset about this.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.421]  So they went back and challenged those people.
[00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:05.543]  They say, hey, why don't you put this gun free zone sign in your yard?
[00:04:06.063 --> 00:04:06.664]  I can't do that.
[00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:07.885]  Somebody might break in my house.
[00:04:08.045 --> 00:04:15.190]  Oh, you think you think if people knew that you didn't have a way to defend yourself, they kick in your front door, steal what you have, maybe hurt your family.
[00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.750]  But
[00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:24.439]  The logic just never seems to amaze me, the logic of these people who spend their days, and we talk about these politicians, surrounded by armed guards.
[00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:32.647]  That's your senators, your congressmen, of course your president, even going down to your city councilmen who want to ban various city ordinances like they do here in Austin.
[00:04:33.027 --> 00:04:43.389]  These people spend at least eight hours of their day, you know, 24 hours a day if they're a president, surrounded by armed on-site security who are ready to rock and roll if something was to happen.
[00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:49.611]  Granted, people sneak into the White House all the time because I guess the Secret Service has other things on their mind, but that's another story.
[00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:51.371]  But first, let's go to this video.
[00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:58.153]  Hidden Cam shows anti-gun congressmen and staffers refusing to promote homes as gun-free zones.
[00:04:59.193 --> 00:05:01.854]  We're called the Citizens Get Censeless Gun Violence.
[00:05:02.134 --> 00:05:04.334]  Basically, we want to see a ban on all guns.
[00:05:04.414 --> 00:05:11.936]  And specifically, we want to put this in people's... In every single lawn, you have people who don't have guns and say, this home is proudly gun-free.
[00:05:11.956 --> 00:05:16.438]  Something you would like to put on in your apartment or in your home?
[00:05:17.898 --> 00:05:20.099]  Oh no!
[00:05:20.359 --> 00:05:23.820]  We would put the sign right out here in front of this office.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.600]  But not your home?
[00:05:26.977 --> 00:05:27.177]  No.
[00:05:27.198 --> 00:05:28.698]  I don't have guns in my house.
[00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:30.239]  That's good.
[00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:31.620]  So you could advertise it, though.
[00:05:32.901 --> 00:05:34.242]  I could, but I don't want to.
[00:05:34.482 --> 00:05:35.162]  Oh, why not?
[00:05:35.723 --> 00:05:36.223]  Because I don't.
[00:05:36.863 --> 00:05:37.984]  I mean, just explain it to me.
[00:05:38.124 --> 00:05:40.165]  Tell me what makes you so nervous.
[00:05:40.205 --> 00:05:42.727]  I just got my car broken into, and we're at our house.
[00:05:43.167 --> 00:05:44.308]  They stole packages off the front.
[00:05:44.408 --> 00:05:47.170]  I mean, we're right there on the verge of a crime.
[00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.971]  So what do you mean?
[00:05:48.991 --> 00:05:50.432]  Like a bad neighborhood?
[00:05:50.452 --> 00:05:51.012]  Yeah, I guess.
[00:05:51.352 --> 00:05:53.213]  So the concern is, oh, there's no gun.
[00:05:53.233 --> 00:05:54.794]  We just kick down the door.
[00:05:54.814 --> 00:05:55.995]  Worst thing that's going to happen.
[00:05:57.193 --> 00:06:07.098]  Well, I mean what I mean then you're basically saying that that you should have a gun in your house to yeah protect it Yeah, but there is yeah, it's so tough right you think somebody would break into your house.
[00:06:07.118 --> 00:06:10.100]  Yeah, if you put it up I wonder you think it'd make you a victim.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.941]  I wonder Wow, what do you think?
[00:06:12.161 --> 00:06:14.382]  I feel like I'm unnecessarily making on the target.
[00:06:14.602 --> 00:06:15.563]  I'm talking with criminals.
[00:06:15.723 --> 00:06:18.364]  No, I know I know I know but on the other side of that
[00:06:20.405 --> 00:06:22.707]  And I'm not surprised at all to get that type of reaction.
[00:06:22.747 --> 00:06:27.671]  Now, one reaction I thought was somewhat surprising was that of actress Lena Dunham.
[00:06:27.911 --> 00:06:35.777]  And let me be clear, when I talk about celebrities reacting to stuff, they have a First Amendment right to say what they want to say, but I also have my First Amendment right to get my two cents about it.
[00:06:36.418 --> 00:06:39.080]  So I'm not attacking the lady, but I just thought this was somewhat interesting.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.381]  And this is actress Lena Dunham.
[00:06:40.521 --> 00:06:42.082]  She's from the HBO series Girls.
[00:06:42.522 --> 00:06:46.926]  And she wants to remove guns from advertisements for Jason Bourne.
[00:06:48.386 --> 00:06:51.608]  And they removed the image, but I'll give you the quote.
[00:06:51.648 --> 00:06:57.210]  She said, New Yorkers, what if we do some peeling and get rid of the guns in the Jason Bourne subway ads?
[00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.491]  I'm so tired of guns, which is very laughable to me.
[00:07:01.091 --> 00:07:03.152]  First, let's talk about Matt Damon.
[00:07:03.832 --> 00:07:05.894]  I don't have a problem with the guy, by and large.
[00:07:05.934 --> 00:07:15.843]  He did recently come out and say that America needed Australian-type gun control, which I was like, I don't understand this logic of these guys who make action movies.
[00:07:15.863 --> 00:07:17.724]  Once again, action movies aren't bad.
[00:07:17.764 --> 00:07:19.185]  Violent video games aren't bad.
[00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:20.647]  Violent music isn't bad.
[00:07:20.687 --> 00:07:22.208]  I'm not calling for any type of censorship.
[00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:25.251]  But it's always interesting to me, these guys who make a living
[00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:33.897]  By promoting these type of gun violence measures as opposed to your action hero who pulls out a firearm as the first option, kills everybody in the room.
[00:07:33.917 --> 00:07:36.359]  I'm like, well, maybe one of those guys is his first day on the job.
[00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:37.920]  Maybe he didn't know what was going on.
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.201]  That's just always my thought.
[00:07:39.241 --> 00:07:41.863]  But you got guys like Matt Damon doing that kind of stuff.
[00:07:42.263 --> 00:07:44.505]  And then you have Lena Dunham on the opposite end.
[00:07:44.945 --> 00:07:49.668]  And at least to Lena Dunham's credit, and I'm not trying to mess up your name, it's just I'm messing up on it.
[00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:52.991]  To her credit, at least she's being consistent with it.
[00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:57.356]  Because as I was saying, you have all these Hollywood actors who go out and make these violent movies.
[00:07:57.676 --> 00:08:05.386]  They go to these red carpet events where right after the picture frame, because you see the picture frame like you see me, but at a Hollywood premiere, that's like a SWAT team standing over there.
[00:08:05.626 --> 00:08:06.908]  It's in Hollywood Reporter and everything.
[00:08:06.928 --> 00:08:07.408]  You can see it.
[00:08:07.869 --> 00:08:10.552]  These guys have full battle rattle SWAT teams.
[00:08:10.572 --> 00:08:11.974]  They got dogs on the red carpet.
[00:08:11.994 --> 00:08:12.735]  They got the bomb.
[00:08:13.496 --> 00:08:26.738]  The bomb machine in the truck over there everything's there to protect them But if you dare have a concealed carry these guys want to make a video saying that you need a turning your gun rights in so we can live in a utopia while they live in these Chateaus and some foreign land
[00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:28.874]  We're good to go.
[00:08:45.555 --> 00:08:53.420]  They have these big bodyguards the bodyguards get arrested for carrying weapons and all the other things like so they live in these Kind of private estates.
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.081]  They don't have to worry about too much.
[00:08:55.121 --> 00:09:08.911]  They go to the red carpet Vince They got the SWAT teams there to watch there But I'm fighting for the rights of the person who works the graveyard shift in the bad part of town Who doesn't have anybody to come and rescue them if something goes bad and speaking of when something goes bad?
[00:09:09.231 --> 00:09:15.275]  We have a robber with an ak-47 shot by a Waffle House customer and this is near Dallas
[00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:20.577]  They say police have identified the suspect in an aggravated robbery at a Waffle House last week.
[00:09:21.177 --> 00:09:28.920]  Customers told police that a man had come into the restaurant armed with an AK-47 and robbed numerous customers as well as the business.
[00:09:29.935 --> 00:09:36.977]  One customer, who is legally carrying a concealed handgun, followed the robber into the parking lot because he was afraid for his wife's safety.
[00:09:37.037 --> 00:09:39.037]  His wife was about to arrive momentarily.
[00:09:39.717 --> 00:09:43.798]  The customer called out to the robber, who then turned and pointed the rifle at him.
[00:09:43.858 --> 00:09:46.879]  The police said the customer then shot the robber several times.
[00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:53.561]  Now, while I do respect the gusto of this customer to go out there and protect his wife and the other people in the facility,
[00:09:54.608 --> 00:10:04.160]  By and large, in most situations, if the bad guy is going away from you, if he's not kidnapping somebody or something else like that where you'd want to follow him, I just say let him go.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.946]  The cops can catch him down the road, they can fight with him if they want, but usually just let the guy go.
[00:10:09.967 --> 00:10:13.028]  If he chooses to do that, it's a case where it worked out well for him.
[00:10:13.469 --> 00:10:17.410]  And I'm not going to badger the guy because he was doing what he thought was right.
[00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:18.451]  And that's really all you can do.
[00:10:18.471 --> 00:10:20.272]  At the end of the day, you do what you think is right.
[00:10:20.332 --> 00:10:22.012]  And luckily, the guy didn't get hurt.
[00:10:22.052 --> 00:10:25.074]  But personally, I'd just say, let the guy go.
[00:10:25.174 --> 00:10:26.894]  And this is the type of story that you won't hear.
[00:10:27.355 --> 00:10:29.276]  Because I was trying to quantify this.
[00:10:29.616 --> 00:10:33.918]  I was thinking about this argument the other day about how people react to guns.
[00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.319]  And I run into these people who say, well, how can you not want to ban guns?
[00:10:37.439 --> 00:10:38.500]  And I give them this example.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:38.840]  I say,
[00:10:39.833 --> 00:10:49.321]  If a guy drove drunk in, let's say, Idaho, and he hit a van and he killed a family of four, it'd be a local news story, maybe a state-wise news story, right?
[00:10:49.621 --> 00:10:58.928]  But if that same situation, a guy in Idaho took an AK-47 and shot four people, it would be the international news sensation, got celebrities and politicians and all these people coming out the woodwork.
[00:10:59.269 --> 00:11:03.192]  Same result, the family of four is still dead, but it's just the tool, the tool
[00:11:03.712 --> 00:11:07.614]  Being the firearm versus a drunk driver using a vehicle as a tool.
[00:11:07.674 --> 00:11:10.716]  If it's a vehicle accident, people don't care.
[00:11:10.776 --> 00:11:15.118]  But if it's an AK-47 or AR-15, it is all the rage.
[00:11:15.538 --> 00:11:20.161]  And as we're continuing our talk about guns, let's talk about some things that are going on in Baton Rouge.
[00:11:20.741 --> 00:11:25.264]  And police say stolen guns would have targeted officers in Baton Rouge, investigators say.
[00:11:26.184 --> 00:11:41.110]  And they say, authorities in Louisiana Tuesday said that a burglary at a Baton Rouge pawn shop was part of a larger conspiracy to target law enforcement officers amid protests over a fatal shooting of African-Americans by police.
[00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:47.573]  Investigators believe four men broke into a pawn shop early Sunday, excuse me, Saturday and stole eight handguns.
[00:11:48.033 --> 00:11:50.794]  Baton Rouge police chief said that one of the suspects
[00:11:51.314 --> 00:12:00.632]  was a captured at the scene and he said they're trying to get guns and get bullets to harm police officers now the thing I want you to note about the suspects in this case
[00:12:01.749 --> 00:12:03.850]  The suspects were targeting eight handguns.
[00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:08.894]  To own a handgun here in the United States of America, you have to be age 21, clean background, and all that stuff.
[00:12:09.274 --> 00:12:19.981]  But as I look at this list of the suspects they know were involved, or the suspects that have been captured, I should say, more accurately, they have a 17-year-old, a 20-year-old, and a 13-year-old.
[00:12:20.001 --> 00:12:23.724]  The thing I want you to take note from that is none of these people are 21 years old.
[00:12:26.005 --> 00:12:31.570]  It always goes back to what I say, if people can't buy a firearm, they will steal a firearm.
[00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:43.659]  Guys who were not old enough to own a pistol in the United States of America broke into some place that had a reasonable security, I'm sure of that, and stole firearms or attempted to steal the firearms.
[00:12:44.039 --> 00:12:48.263]  The guys who got shot, the bailiffs up in Michigan, I believe it was,
[00:12:48.883 --> 00:12:52.005]  Somebody stole somebody's pistol and started shooting at them.
[00:12:52.085 --> 00:12:56.407]  Somebody was handcuffed, you know, in his orange jumpsuit, stole a pistol and opened fire on people.
[00:12:56.727 --> 00:13:03.190]  The guy who tried to kill Donald Trump went to an active-duty, conscious police officer and tried to steal his pistol.
[00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:07.132]  If you can't buy a gun, people are bold enough to try to steal them from police.
[00:13:07.552 --> 00:13:12.315]  Banning firearms is not the issue to your problem, just as I gave you the example of the drunk driver.
[00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:19.594]  It's that old adage that these liberals, they love abortion, but they would try to ban it if they performed abortions with firearms.
[00:13:19.934 --> 00:13:21.916]  But I think that's enough on the gun issue.
[00:13:21.936 --> 00:13:24.838]  Let's talk about some other things that affect our nation.
[00:13:25.697 --> 00:13:26.537]  Talk about Donald Trump.
[00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:31.339]  I know he's everybody's favorite topic and he's getting closer to picking his VP.
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.081]  Many people are speculating as to who it's going to be.
[00:13:34.541 --> 00:13:43.705]  He recently met with Governor Mike Pence and they said they met after a rally and they had a very good chat, though it has not been confirmed if he is going to be the VP.
[00:13:43.745 --> 00:13:52.229]  The other contenders for the VP spot, so says the news, are Newt Gingrich and also New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.
[00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:54.830]  I wouldn't be happy with
[00:13:56.372 --> 00:13:57.293]  I was about to say all three.
[00:13:57.333 --> 00:14:03.036]  I don't know too much about Mike Pence, but Christie and Newt Gingrich are not my cup of tea.
[00:14:03.617 --> 00:14:04.897]  Now let's go on to some other news.
[00:14:04.937 --> 00:14:12.102]  We know that the Attorney General Lynch has refused to answer questions accurately about her conversation with Bill Clinton.
[00:14:12.462 --> 00:14:15.744]  We have this article here saying that Congressman David Trout
[00:14:16.144 --> 00:14:20.769]  So, you know, the meeting on the tarmac with former President Clinton, that was a pretty fortuitous meeting for you, wasn't it?
[00:14:38.177 --> 00:14:38.917]  I would not say that.
[00:14:39.278 --> 00:14:54.947]  Well, it gave you a perfect alibi, because if you had recused yourself, as some have suggested, at the outset of this investigation, because you're friends with the Clintons and maybe hope to be Attorney General in her administration, then you wouldn't have, then you could stand here and say, I defer to the FBI Director.
[00:14:55.527 --> 00:15:03.193]  But you didn't recuse yourself, but now you're using the meeting on the tarmac to basically say, to avoid the appearance of impropriety, I can't answer your question.
[00:15:03.634 --> 00:15:04.875]  Isn't that basically what's happened here today?
[00:15:05.275 --> 00:15:08.598]  Congressman, I would not say it was fortuitous for me or for anyone.
[00:15:08.618 --> 00:15:12.040]  It led me to take, again, another unusual step in this case.
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.021]  But that's what's happened today.
[00:15:13.281 --> 00:15:15.924]  In fact, I knew you weren't going to answer our questions today.
[00:15:16.724 --> 00:15:20.448]  And I apologize for wasting so much time here because it's really not been very productive.
[00:15:20.888 --> 00:15:30.097]  I asked my staff to count the number of times today you would say I can't answer that question or refuse to give an appropriate response.
[00:15:30.117 --> 00:15:30.938]  It's happened 74 times so far.
[00:15:32.921 --> 00:15:34.622]  So, really, it's either one of two things.
[00:15:34.662 --> 00:15:42.586]  Either you're saying that because you want to avoid the appearance of impropriety, in which case you should have recused yourself, or you're trying to protect Hillary Clinton.
[00:15:43.127 --> 00:15:52.452]  So, my colleague, Mr. Smith, asked earlier if you had talked with Bill or Hillary about serving as Attorney General in Hillary's administration.
[00:15:52.852 --> 00:15:54.053]  Have you talked to any of their staff?
[00:15:54.513 --> 00:15:55.033]  No, I have not.
[00:15:55.113 --> 00:15:56.634]  Have you talked to anyone on their transition team?
[00:15:56.674 --> 00:15:57.695]  I know they're talking to people.
[00:15:58.095 --> 00:16:04.677]  I've not spoken to anyone on either the campaign or transition or any staff members affiliated with them.
[00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:06.858]  Do you want to be Attorney General?
[00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.038]  Moving quickly now, we're going to talk about U.S.
[00:16:10.098 --> 00:16:10.679]  food stock.
[00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:11.959]  Half of U.S.
[00:16:12.199 --> 00:16:15.060]  food produce is thrown away, new research suggests.
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:25.925]  Fast quantities of fresh produce grown in the United States are left in the field to rot, fed to livestock, or hauled away from the field to a landfill because of unrealistic beauty standards.
[00:16:25.965 --> 00:16:31.707]  Basically, people are judging the food by its look, not by its taste or, you know, health benefit.
[00:16:31.747 --> 00:16:39.151]  And it says by one government tally, about $160 billion is wasted by retailers and customers every year.
[00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:40.271]  Something to think about.
[00:16:40.711 --> 00:16:41.472]  Moving quickly now.
[00:16:42.492 --> 00:16:43.773]  Things going on in New York.
[00:17:03.244 --> 00:17:03.664]  I don't think so.
[00:17:33.117 --> 00:17:37.959]  There is no other way out of this b****, except from this gate that's f****** closed.
[00:17:38.479 --> 00:17:38.799]  Okay.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.720]  Push button to exit the gate.
[00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:44.121]  If the gate is closed.
[00:17:44.221 --> 00:17:44.622]  Bruh.
[00:17:45.102 --> 00:17:48.603]  This button is broke the f*** off.
[00:17:50.124 --> 00:17:52.025]  And I can't open the gate.
[00:17:52.365 --> 00:17:55.126]  It won't work.
[00:17:55.726 --> 00:17:57.627]  Jonathan Collins, you shut the f*** up.
[00:17:57.687 --> 00:18:01.448]  If you were trapped in a graveyard, you'd be freaking the f*** out too.
[00:18:01.809 --> 00:18:02.449]  Bruh, like.
[00:18:15.646 --> 00:18:20.570]  No one will go to the New York Times or care that it's even admitted that the government's hatching most of the terror plots.
[00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.231]  Or people will say, what are you doing?
[00:18:22.571 --> 00:18:23.752]  Endorsing radical Islam?
[00:18:23.792 --> 00:18:24.553]  Saying it doesn't exist?
[00:18:24.913 --> 00:18:25.613]  I didn't say that!
[00:18:25.633 --> 00:18:35.561]  I said our criminal government is arming them, aiding and abetting them, protecting them to attack and kill us so they can take our freedoms!
[00:18:36.101 --> 00:18:36.922]  That's what
[00:18:37.402 --> 00:18:44.105]  I said never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 proof.
[00:18:44.545 --> 00:18:48.427]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:18:50.428 --> 00:18:58.611]  CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, Glenn Beck, and everybody else that runs around claiming that I'm saying there aren't any real Muslim terrorists.
[00:18:58.951 --> 00:19:00.992]  That's a load of crud and you know it.
[00:19:01.352 --> 00:19:04.634]  There is an attack on the human institution of family.
[00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:09.031]  And if you want to take down the nuclear family, you attack males.
[00:19:09.891 --> 00:19:13.692]  Males are the defender of the human tribe.
[00:19:14.252 --> 00:19:18.993]  When men fall, the rest of humanity can be completely enslaved.
[00:19:19.773 --> 00:19:23.454]  The attack on the family is in movies, sitcoms, dramas.
[00:19:23.734 --> 00:19:25.194]  This isn't to empower women.
[00:19:25.735 --> 00:19:27.235]  This is to wreck civilization.
[00:19:27.495 --> 00:19:33.198]  For too long, we have been allowing the globalist controllers to launch a full-scale chemical war on our masculinity.
[00:19:33.398 --> 00:19:34.479]  You've seen the headlines.
[00:19:34.499 --> 00:19:40.122]  The estrogen mimickers and the gender-bending compounds in the food and water supply are changing the way our bodies work.
[00:19:40.242 --> 00:19:44.084]  And men are the number one target of this program.
[00:19:44.284 --> 00:19:47.966]  With the estrogen mimickers in the plastics, in the printer paper, and
[00:19:48.166 --> 00:19:49.366]  Thousands of other items.
[00:19:49.747 --> 00:19:50.447]  It's on record.
[00:19:50.767 --> 00:19:57.169]  Our testosterone level, many times by the time we hit 40, is 80% lower than it should be or more.
[00:19:57.349 --> 00:20:04.851]  Our sperm counts, depending on which western country you look at, are 80 to almost 96% reduced.
[00:20:05.472 --> 00:20:08.593]  Fertility is plummeting through the floor.
[00:20:09.173 --> 00:20:12.814]  Now it's impossible, even if you're a health nut, to avoid all of this.
[00:20:13.574 --> 00:20:14.855]  But for myself personally,
[00:20:15.655 --> 00:20:20.097]  What I've experienced with the products at Infowarslife.com has been simply amazing.
[00:20:20.998 --> 00:20:24.279]  Supermail Vitality has changed my life in the last three years.
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:30.783]  That's why we wanted to develop something that works in conjunction with Supermail to take it to the next level.
[00:20:31.243 --> 00:20:32.744]  It's only been out for about six months.
[00:20:33.584 --> 00:20:42.410]  It sold out so quickly in its first run and now it is back after months of not being available and ThroPlex.
[00:20:43.171 --> 00:20:49.295]  The reason we sell out when other big vitamin and mineral and nutraceutical makers don't
[00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:56.040]  Is because we only source the purest, cleanest, high quality, organic products.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:05.947]  And it's really hard when you've got a formulation that's got a bunch of really great ingredients in it to get them and to always have them be perfectly clean and to be able to pass some of the highest standards in the world.
[00:21:06.247 --> 00:21:17.095]  When you go to InfoWarsLife.com, you can see that for yourself and find out why Anthroplex taken by itself or in conjunction with Super Male Vitality is such a game changer.
[00:21:17.416 --> 00:21:18.656]  This is the next level.
[00:21:19.617 --> 00:21:23.559]  And I'm so proud that we were able to bring a product like this to you.
[00:21:24.219 --> 00:21:26.861]  This is how men were supposed to feel.
[00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:31.583]  Quite frankly, I remember what it felt like to be 18 or 19 or 20.
[00:21:32.123 --> 00:21:36.686]  To be crazed, to be aggressive, to feel just exhilaration.
[00:21:37.566 --> 00:21:46.950]  And it's the Super Mel Vitality and the AnthroPlex with exercise and a better diet that have taken me back to where I was and quite frankly beyond.
[00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:48.090]  It's amazing.
[00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:52.112]  And AnthroPlex is now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:52.432 --> 00:21:57.954]  Men, do yourself a favor and get a bottle of AnthroPlex today and see what I'm talking about.
[00:21:58.455 --> 00:22:06.198]  All of our products at InfoWarsLife.com are recognized as safe and they are made in FDA certified labs.
[00:22:06.698 --> 00:22:12.662]  The media tries to demonize supplements because, quite frankly, Mother Nature's got a lot to offer that Big Pharma doesn't.
[00:22:13.283 --> 00:22:17.866]  But there are some bad companies out there and there are some substances that Mother Nature produces that aren't good for you.
[00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:26.952]  That's why everything we put in these products is recognized as safe and produced at the highest level, highest quality FDA certified labs.
[00:22:27.412 --> 00:22:35.591]  Talk to your physician or healthcare provider before you take Anthraplex or any of the products at InfoWarsLife.com like X2.
[00:22:36.092 --> 00:22:36.413]  Because...
[00:22:37.472 --> 00:22:38.152]  This stuff's real.
[00:22:38.553 --> 00:22:41.834]  Just one of the ingredients in anthroplex is horny goat weed.
[00:22:42.094 --> 00:22:47.897]  In Chinese traditional medicine, it is recognized as one of the most powerful male stimulants.
[00:22:48.378 --> 00:22:51.099]  Not just of libido, but overall vitality.
[00:22:51.479 --> 00:22:57.922]  We put together a classic formula, souped up with the highest quality at a very low price.
[00:22:58.383 --> 00:23:00.304]  Available at Infowarslife.com today.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:08.444]  For the balance of the hour, George Humphrey, my good friend, going back 25 years to when we were both involved.
[00:23:08.464 --> 00:23:12.307]  He was like one of the heads of the campaign locally for Pat Buchanan.
[00:23:12.927 --> 00:23:15.329]  Back then, handing out pamphlets about the private Federal Reserve.
[00:23:15.349 --> 00:23:17.290]  He's written several best-selling books.
[00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:18.251]  His new book just came out.
[00:23:18.271 --> 00:23:19.212]  It's on Amazon.com.
[00:23:19.532 --> 00:23:20.333]  Life, Love, Joy.
[00:23:21.033 --> 00:23:30.958]  A story of humanity's origins, the polarity of present choices and our unrealized potential getting into what the globalists actually think, but from a different perspective.
[00:23:30.998 --> 00:23:38.081]  And let me tell you, whether what he gets into in the book is accurate or not, it's the cosmology of the elite, just from a different perspective.
[00:23:38.181 --> 00:23:41.463]  Why they think the way they think, why they're waging war against humanity.
[00:23:43.601 --> 00:23:45.663]  The globalists say they're going to break away and be their own species.
[00:23:45.703 --> 00:23:50.907]  They believe their psychopathic behavior is actually advanced.
[00:23:50.927 --> 00:23:56.691]  It's why they interbreed with each other in every elite culture throughout history, actually as a parasite on humanity.
[00:23:56.792 --> 00:23:58.613]  And they're creating new species.
[00:23:58.633 --> 00:24:00.274]  What do you think AI computers are?
[00:24:00.294 --> 00:24:02.036]  What do you think all this stuff is?
[00:24:03.197 --> 00:24:05.338]  So we're going to be talking about that with George Humphrey.
[00:24:05.358 --> 00:24:08.020]  But George, you know, you've been a city council person.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.522]  You've been involved at the lobbying level.
[00:24:11.363 --> 00:24:12.624]  You've seen a lot of things around the world.
[00:24:12.644 --> 00:24:17.526]  You've been an international businessman, a real estate developer, you know, jack-of-all-trades, smart guy.
[00:24:18.346 --> 00:24:20.807]  Looking at the current climate, have you ever seen anything like it?
[00:24:20.887 --> 00:24:21.848]  How would you describe it?
[00:24:22.248 --> 00:24:29.391]  And then looking at Donald Trump and this whole phenomenon as he begins to pull ahead in scientific polls, I really think they're going to come after him physically.
[00:24:29.431 --> 00:24:32.473]  And what would you say to the Bernie Sanders supporters later?
[00:24:32.493 --> 00:24:33.113]  I want to talk about this.
[00:24:33.553 --> 00:24:35.154]  How could they support Hillary?
[00:24:35.914 --> 00:24:37.835]  When, obviously, she's the establishment candidate.
[00:24:38.595 --> 00:24:40.076]  Well, first of all, it's good to be here.
[00:24:40.336 --> 00:24:41.137]  Thanks for coming, man.
[00:24:41.177 --> 00:24:41.797]  You look good.
[00:24:41.857 --> 00:24:42.778]  I love you, brother.
[00:24:43.198 --> 00:24:44.739]  And it's always fun to be on this show.
[00:24:44.839 --> 00:24:50.041]  And doing this kind of work is the most life-invigorating work I could ever do.
[00:24:50.362 --> 00:24:54.644]  And I think for most of you listeners, when you talk about this stuff, it invigorates your life.
[00:24:54.884 --> 00:24:56.125]  And we're not doom and gloom.
[00:24:56.165 --> 00:24:58.486]  We're about making this planet a better place.
[00:24:58.946 --> 00:25:03.929]  Now, it's my opinion that most, not all, but most of the Bernie Sanders people
[00:25:04.469 --> 00:25:14.713]  They are young, their hearts are open, they want to do the right thing, they realize how much corruption is out there, but they just haven't had the experience.
[00:25:15.393 --> 00:25:25.017]  And I have a lot of people I know who were Bernie Sanders people, and I listen to what they're saying, and I say, I agree with that concept, and I agree with that concept.
[00:25:25.157 --> 00:25:28.498]  But I say, what is the greatest danger to our world and our country?
[00:25:29.498 --> 00:25:30.459]  And then think about it.
[00:25:30.699 --> 00:25:33.560]  It's the consolidation of power of the government.
[00:25:34.899 --> 00:25:38.803]  The power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely, right?
[00:25:39.583 --> 00:25:40.864]  And they go, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:25:41.124 --> 00:25:43.426]  And what's Bernie's, what's his plan?
[00:25:43.526 --> 00:25:45.328]  Is to give all the power to the government.
[00:25:45.969 --> 00:25:47.750]  And then they go, oh, yeah.
[00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:51.593]  And then they start realizing, now all this attack on Trump, it's, I'm,
[00:25:54.059 --> 00:25:59.664]  I'm still not 100% for Trump, but in comparison to Hillary, sign me up.
[00:26:00.245 --> 00:26:05.189]  You know, he's against the TPP, he's against vaccines, he's for protecting our borders.
[00:26:05.209 --> 00:26:07.351]  He says she's a communist Chinese agent, which she is.
[00:26:07.371 --> 00:26:10.714]  Remember us back in the mid-90s exposing her.
[00:26:10.754 --> 00:26:16.119]  She is so many things, and anyone who is voting for Hillary Clinton
[00:26:17.043 --> 00:26:24.749]  Is either totally mind-controlled, which is about 95% of the people, or you're just, you're getting paid off in some ways.
[00:26:24.869 --> 00:26:30.413]  You're an incredible, ignorant traitor if you're supporting Hillary.
[00:26:30.693 --> 00:26:35.937]  And we can go over point by point by point by point by point by point by point.
[00:26:36.517 --> 00:26:38.920]  Why Hillary is not good for America.
[00:26:39.221 --> 00:26:41.403]  Why Hillary is not good for your families.
[00:26:41.764 --> 00:26:43.787]  Why Hillary is not good for this earth.
[00:26:44.968 --> 00:26:45.909]  Who is Hillary Clinton?
[00:26:45.949 --> 00:26:47.752]  I mean she just looks and acts like a robot.
[00:26:48.464 --> 00:26:50.524]  Well, a satanically-possessed robot.
[00:26:50.564 --> 00:26:54.225]  I mean, she looks like the Joker meets the Stepford Wives.
[00:26:54.665 --> 00:26:59.106]  And remember, remember, Hillary is only a puppet.
[00:27:00.427 --> 00:27:03.047]  There are people who are pulling her sleeves.
[00:27:03.527 --> 00:27:10.069]  And so, I don't put all my attention into attacking Hillary, because it's self-evident that she is a fraud.
[00:27:10.109 --> 00:27:11.049]  But she's the establishment candidate.
[00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:15.693]  Bernie Sanders people support her when she stole the election from Sanders.
[00:27:15.853 --> 00:27:17.535]  And especially in California.
[00:27:17.575 --> 00:27:23.400]  What happened in California was a complete, complete snow job in which the votes were stolen.
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:26.063]  And remember... Well they just decided who was going to be the winner the day before.
[00:27:26.703 --> 00:27:27.263]  Yeah, of course.
[00:27:27.383 --> 00:27:31.905]  With paper ballots, you can stuff one ballot box at a time.
[00:27:32.565 --> 00:27:35.946]  With four computer companies, you can do whole cities at a time.
[00:27:36.246 --> 00:27:37.746]  Folks, this is self-evident.
[00:27:37.946 --> 00:27:42.547]  There's no way to recount the votes, and Hillary's people control the machine.
[00:27:42.567 --> 00:27:51.130]  And that's why they want centralization everywhere, is because then they can scam and run things, and a few little things that don't match won't expose it.
[00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:55.191]  But this time, they didn't just steal it and have the computers come out the way they wanted, they admitted it.
[00:27:56.031 --> 00:28:10.959]  The AP that runs what they formerly called Voter News Services, we covered this at Nauseam for new listeners, they talked to the superdelegates and then projected who would win and decided the night before what the numbers would be to program the computers and then admitted it in the newspapers!
[00:28:11.159 --> 00:28:11.639]  Of course.
[00:28:11.999 --> 00:28:21.644]  Now, this is... But we may now reach the point, George, where they admit, okay, there is a world government and it's unelected, but it's not the one the conspiracy theorist told you about.
[00:28:22.045 --> 00:28:22.265]  Right!
[00:28:23.973 --> 00:28:27.576]  You know, Hillary is 100% behind the TPP.
[00:28:27.956 --> 00:28:31.579]  TPP makes NAFTA and GAP look like child's play.
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:33.080]  Let me repeat that.
[00:28:33.361 --> 00:28:42.608]  TPP is the most dangerous agreement that this government has ever signed and is the greatest danger to your freedoms and to this republic.
[00:28:42.868 --> 00:28:44.069]  Hillary Clinton is for it 100%.
[00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:46.111]  But she's going to stick up for women.
[00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:50.829]  Brothers and sisters.
[00:28:50.849 --> 00:28:54.771]  What do you think of CNN, though, when they took her and had her be worshipped and said she was a golden goddess?
[00:28:55.432 --> 00:28:56.092]  Have you seen that?
[00:28:56.712 --> 00:28:58.573]  I have, when she had all the white on.
[00:28:58.774 --> 00:29:06.818]  I mean, it's almost comical, except it's not comical, because it is a matter of life and death.
[00:29:07.778 --> 00:29:09.359]  It is a matter of life and death.
[00:29:09.679 --> 00:29:16.242]  Not only the life and death of the rule of law and the republic, but of the future of this country.
[00:29:16.322 --> 00:29:16.783]  And folks,
[00:29:17.719 --> 00:29:18.821]  It is up to us.
[00:29:19.061 --> 00:29:20.704]  You know, it's not all doom and gloom.
[00:29:21.024 --> 00:29:21.946]  No, we're not.
[00:29:22.186 --> 00:29:23.388]  We're admitting how bad it is.
[00:29:23.408 --> 00:29:24.290]  In fact, this is a good paradigm.
[00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.891]  You always point out it.
[00:29:24.951 --> 00:29:25.812]  And you say this 20 years ago.
[00:29:25.852 --> 00:29:26.513]  I mean, I didn't get it.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.440]  Hey, we gotta give people hope.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:32.602]  And I'm thinking, yeah, I'm exposing the evil, the hope is we better fight it, because that's just how my instincts are.
[00:29:32.622 --> 00:29:34.943]  A lot of other folks hear something's overwhelming, they just give up.
[00:29:34.983 --> 00:29:35.284]  No, no, no.
[00:29:35.524 --> 00:29:42.207]  We're exposing it because exposing them, basic humanity will turn against them, like the Brexit, and that's now beginning.
[00:29:42.307 --> 00:29:44.788]  That's why it's such an exciting time to be alive.
[00:29:45.108 --> 00:29:50.610]  They're having to pull out all the stops to try to block us right now, but they're not successful at this point.
[00:29:50.891 --> 00:29:53.852]  They're losing control, and you see the whole world
[00:29:54.292 --> 00:29:55.592]  Resisting globalism now.
[00:29:55.652 --> 00:29:57.393]  The whole world is coming together.
[00:29:57.553 --> 00:30:00.273]  That's why they're activating George Soros groups.
[00:30:00.313 --> 00:30:04.334]  He admits it on race and religious lines to cause infighting.
[00:30:04.474 --> 00:30:05.774]  There's beefs with everybody.
[00:30:05.935 --> 00:30:06.955]  There's real bad cops.
[00:30:07.155 --> 00:30:09.695]  There's real bad white supremacists or blacks, of course.
[00:30:09.955 --> 00:30:19.517]  But they blow it up out of proportion and make it the only issue so we're all uncomfortable fighting with each other so we don't see the controllers above us that are coming after everybody.
[00:30:19.777 --> 00:30:20.718]  Absolutely Alex.
[00:30:20.758 --> 00:30:21.818]  So let's get into where you think
[00:30:22.858 --> 00:30:25.461]  Trump's going, the state of the world right now.
[00:30:25.641 --> 00:30:27.222]  All you have to do is look at history.
[00:30:27.242 --> 00:30:34.768]  1980, we had the Iran Fair when Jimmy Carter was being taken over by Ronald Reagan.
[00:30:34.788 --> 00:30:37.150]  1992, we had Waco and we had Oklahoma City.
[00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.532]  All these are false flag events.
[00:30:39.892 --> 00:30:41.854]  2011, the biggest false flag event of all time. 2008,
[00:30:43.755 --> 00:31:03.711]  And I do astrology, and whether you believe in it or not, is that there is the objective history of false flag events, and it appears to me as though a month and a half to two months before the election, or two months or three months after the election, there is the possibility of a huge mass of false flag events.
[00:31:04.172 --> 00:31:05.513]  And knowledge is power.
[00:31:06.033 --> 00:31:14.616]  People like Alex and others around the world are putting out objective information so that we do not get blindsided this time.
[00:31:15.136 --> 00:31:25.859]  We know what's coming on because what they want to do is the old Hegelian theory, problem-reaction-solution, problem-reaction-solution, thesis-and-synthesis.
[00:31:26.279 --> 00:31:28.780]  And friends, we have the ability now.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:33.882]  We're building up the energy so that we can transcend this stuff.
[00:31:34.622 --> 00:31:37.386]  And they almost can't do it anymore because they always get caught.
[00:31:37.426 --> 00:31:38.687]  Well, they're always getting caught.
[00:31:38.767 --> 00:31:39.929]  I mean, what happened to Orlando?
[00:31:39.949 --> 00:31:41.070]  Let's talk about astrology.
[00:31:41.791 --> 00:31:44.354]  I personally just don't get into all that whatever.
[00:31:44.654 --> 00:31:48.038]  But then you look at the elite, I mean, around the world, they are obsessed with it.
[00:31:48.319 --> 00:31:49.480]  They're making their decisions.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.280]  Well, remember, everything is energy.
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:51.301]  Everything is energy.
[00:31:51.581 --> 00:31:55.083]  And if by understanding energy, we learn the astrology to transcend it.
[00:32:07.449 --> 00:32:08.270]  Let me repeat that.
[00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:28.107]  We learn to transcend the astrology to transcend for us to become our own highest Christ itself for each human being to become the best that they can be to live in cooperation and honesty and truth and all the things that we're talking about which is the basic bedrock of the Republic of this country.
[00:32:28.527 --> 00:32:28.868]  Friends,
[00:32:29.997 --> 00:32:31.158]  This is not new stuff.
[00:32:31.198 --> 00:32:35.561]  This has gone way back to the one called Jesus, and even way, way back before that.
[00:32:36.162 --> 00:32:46.270]  We have the option right now, and even though we're facing the greatest danger, the greatest danger to the future of humanity on this planet, we're also
[00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.971]  ...have the greatest opportunity to transcend.
[00:32:49.011 --> 00:32:59.835]  But it's going to take people, it's taking people like Alex and many others who have the backbone and the courage to speak the truth and to say, hey look, this is not right.
[00:32:59.975 --> 00:33:01.436]  The king has no clothes on.
[00:33:02.526 --> 00:33:07.990]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:09.031]  Unveiled!
[00:33:09.431 --> 00:33:12.493]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula.
[00:33:13.174 --> 00:33:13.634]  30 servings.
[00:33:13.834 --> 00:33:16.436]  Fruit punch flavor dietary supplement.
[00:33:16.736 --> 00:33:17.797]  It is simply amazing.
[00:33:17.857 --> 00:33:18.818]  Infowarslife.com
[00:33:19.198 --> 00:33:23.600]  There's a million different products like this out there, but they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:37.227]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all the essential amino acids, all the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:38.808]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:40.029]  I put it in my protein shake.
[00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:46.133]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:49.175]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:51.456]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[00:33:52.057 --> 00:33:58.201]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:00.783]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[00:34:01.143 --> 00:34:03.004]  Okay, this... Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:05.346]  Yeah, this... I wanna... But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:05.726]  Yeah.
[00:34:05.946 --> 00:34:07.447]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:10.349]  There's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com that are excellent.
[00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:11.909]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.152]  This is just the very best we can bring you, and when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:39.919]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body, because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:41.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:41.087 --> 00:34:44.228]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[00:34:44.328 --> 00:34:45.568]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:46.168]  Tell folks about that.
[00:34:46.328 --> 00:34:49.088]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.589]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:55.670]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine.
[00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.510]  Each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.131]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:04.691]  34 other ones you can check out.
[00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.731]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:09.552]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:19.939]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just by the way look on the other side too because we're showing people the minerals and things let's look at the vitamins right there old Scott in there I mean it's amazing.
[00:35:19.979 --> 00:35:20.440]  Top left.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.862]  Again if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.285]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's the other source?
[00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.707]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:32.806]  Retinol.
[00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:37.328]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[00:35:37.649 --> 00:35:38.049]  And you know what?
[00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:40.290]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.110]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:48.154]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:53.997]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:55.358]  So get them today!
[00:35:55.418 --> 00:35:59.441]  Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:00.442 --> 00:36:01.983]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:36:02.363 --> 00:36:08.288]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[00:36:08.508 --> 00:36:09.649]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:25.219]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:29.582]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:36:33.604 --> 00:36:40.690]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:36:41.031 --> 00:36:46.696]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:36:46.896 --> 00:36:53.022]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[00:36:53.322 --> 00:36:57.065]  Check them out today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[00:37:04.335 --> 00:37:06.475]  So you've probably heard of Pokemon Go.
[00:37:06.675 --> 00:37:12.556]  It's the mobile game where you can go around, it's geolocated, and you catch little creatures called Pokemon.
[00:37:12.576 --> 00:37:14.897]  And some interesting stories coming out about that, right?
[00:37:14.937 --> 00:37:19.878]  So you've got this woman who found a body in a river from playing Pokemon Go.
[00:37:20.418 --> 00:37:24.058]  But then, you've also got some more concerning articles, right?
[00:37:24.298 --> 00:37:27.319]  While you track Pokemon, Pokemon Go tracks you.
[00:37:27.619 --> 00:37:32.440]  And it talks about how this app is collecting the data of millions and millions of people because
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.081]  Obviously no one reads the Terms of Service.
[00:37:35.461 --> 00:37:43.126]  You download an app or you install something on your computer, it would take 30 days per year if you actually read all the Terms of Service.
[00:37:43.366 --> 00:37:45.047]  It's just basically impossible.
[00:37:45.527 --> 00:37:50.330]  So what they're doing is they're collecting pretty much all they possibly can.
[00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:52.251]  They're collecting your location,
[00:37:52.831 --> 00:37:56.512]  Every single thing about you they can gather from your phone and your kids, too.
[00:37:56.772 --> 00:37:59.573]  Even if your kids are under the age of 12, they're still getting it.
[00:37:59.833 --> 00:38:03.334]  And at their discretion, they're going to give it to anyone they please, right?
[00:38:03.794 --> 00:38:07.295]  So there's numerous pieces in USA Today, Tech Crunch about this.
[00:38:07.796 --> 00:38:09.396]  And, you know, I was talking to Dr. Group earlier.
[00:38:09.456 --> 00:38:12.317]  He came in today to be on the show.
[00:38:12.797 --> 00:38:18.081]  And he was telling me about what he found out about Pokemon Go, and it's wild because it's such a big thing right now.
[00:38:18.821 --> 00:38:19.682]  It's a silly thing, right?
[00:38:19.702 --> 00:38:25.726]  It's a silly game, but it's really not that silly the way they track you and your kids when you're using this.
[00:38:25.866 --> 00:38:30.069]  And he was showing me about some of the permissions, and I thought it was absolutely absurd.
[00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:32.311]  So, Dr. Group, what's going on with this?
[00:38:33.206 --> 00:38:34.087]  Well, it's good to know.
[00:38:34.127 --> 00:38:37.589]  It's always good to be aware and especially for parents out there.
[00:38:37.609 --> 00:38:42.532]  I mean, even there's there are a lot of adults playing this a lot of young children.
[00:38:42.592 --> 00:38:59.784]  I have two young boys and I tell you what I you know, I don't allow them to play a lot of these games, but I know parents that just kids have full access to purchase all these apps and the scary thing is we're losing our privacy.
[00:38:59.884 --> 00:39:02.766]  You know that we know that we talk about it all the time, but
[00:39:03.826 --> 00:39:16.175]  Since the Pokemon Go has been in the news, we did a little bit of digging and I started looking at it and found out that the Pokemon Go was created by a company called Niantic.
[00:39:17.356 --> 00:39:26.202]  And Niantic actually has connections with the company Keyhole, and anybody can do this research themselves.
[00:39:26.302 --> 00:39:31.326]  Keyhole was actually acquired by Google back in 2004, so that's strange.
[00:39:33.858 --> 00:39:55.370]  If you dig even deeper, you'll see that Keyhole received funding from a firm called In-Q-Tel, which is a government controlled venture capital firm, and they invest in companies that will help beef up, you know, their security and different types of methods that they can, you know, look at you and spy on you, basically.
[00:39:56.238 --> 00:40:01.643]  And what they do is they collect and analyze and distribute geospatial intelligence.
[00:40:02.504 --> 00:40:13.794]  So as far as I'm concerned, Pokemon Go would be an ideal vessel basically to look at and to take geospatial analysis and evidence everywhere.
[00:40:14.275 --> 00:40:19.800]  So in turn, then one of the big things is, well, what is the privacy policy or what are they doing?
[00:40:21.144 --> 00:40:39.948]  Niantic's privacy policy for Pokemon Go says that it may share the aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for research and analysis, demographic profiling, and other similar purposes.
[00:40:40.008 --> 00:40:45.329]  And the reason why we think this is really big news to share with everybody out there is because
[00:40:47.731 --> 00:40:56.951]  The strange thing is, is the company says that it will also disclose information about users including children under the age of 13.
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:01.421]  Who have been authorized by their parents to use the app.
[00:41:02.041 --> 00:41:04.682]  Now, they can turn on your video portion.
[00:41:05.482 --> 00:41:09.263]  They have direct access to your Gmail accounts through your phone.
[00:41:09.743 --> 00:41:16.345]  So if you accept this app and you accept their privacy policy, they can access every single thing on your phone.
[00:41:16.525 --> 00:41:18.165]  They can access your pictures.
[00:41:18.225 --> 00:41:20.065]  They can access your email accounts.
[00:41:20.606 --> 00:41:25.347]  And if you play the game, they can actually record everything through your video camera
[00:41:26.267 --> 00:41:49.104]  And one of the sections in the privacy notice says that they are authorized to give this information to government or law enforcement officers or private parties as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate
[00:41:50.049 --> 00:42:11.019]  To respond to claims, legal process, including subpoenas, to protect our property rights and safety, and the property rights and safety of a third party, or the public in general, to identify and stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity.
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:13.921]  Which means, what is this like Pokemon Go now?
[00:42:13.981 --> 00:42:16.262]  The new police force on the streets?
[00:42:16.542 --> 00:42:17.663]  At their sole discretion, right?
[00:42:17.923 --> 00:42:19.324]  So this is from USA Today.
[00:42:19.625 --> 00:42:22.407]  It talks about, you know, it would take 30 days a year to read the Terms of Service.
[00:42:22.707 --> 00:42:27.611]  And then it says, to understand how the app can use data, it helps to know what data the app can collect.
[00:42:27.631 --> 00:42:33.495]  It says, for Android users, the game can access both the precise and general locations of the device, as well as its camera.
[00:42:33.896 --> 00:42:36.017]  Permission is inherently necessary to play the game.
[00:42:36.718 --> 00:42:44.626]  Because basically how it works, by the way, is you use the camera and you are essentially using something hooked up to a version of like Google Maps.
[00:42:44.666 --> 00:42:51.774]  And you're going around and there's these certain Pokemon, which are creatures in the game that you catch, and there are certain areas that's geospecific.
[00:42:51.854 --> 00:42:54.777]  So you could go downtown or something and there's supposed to be some rare Pokemon there.
[00:42:55.077 --> 00:43:08.566]  That's why there's women, like, finding bodies in rivers and, like, getting trapped in cemeteries and stuff, and people are, like, wandering around government locations and bases and stuff because someone said there was a Pokémon there.
[00:43:09.167 --> 00:43:19.574]  Now, what they do is they sell, presumably, presumably, that's how a lot of these apps and companies make their money, is they sell the so-called aggregate data, which would be like, oh, these people traveled here, whatever.
[00:43:20.094 --> 00:43:22.096]  And also, an interesting thought,
[00:43:22.996 --> 00:43:28.539]  Is it could be tied in with a map system, a mapsing type system where people are walking around.
[00:43:28.559 --> 00:43:32.421]  They say it's threatening to surpass Twitter in the amount of players.
[00:43:32.721 --> 00:43:36.143]  People are basically just mapping with all this because it's tracking where you're going.
[00:43:37.224 --> 00:43:41.886]  And some security experts are saying they can be used quote for good and bad.
[00:43:42.507 --> 00:43:47.910]  An associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University said that basically, you know, it's
[00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:52.173]  They're going to monetize the data for advertising like Facebook and Google.
[00:43:52.353 --> 00:43:59.479]  See, you know, it's not just the little ads on Facebook on the right side or the sponsored posts that are making it billions upon billions of dollars.
[00:43:59.559 --> 00:44:01.140]  It's the fact that they get the user data.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:06.725]  That's always what these big apps want is your user data so they can track you, they can look at your interests.
[00:44:07.125 --> 00:44:11.228]  This apparently ties into your Google account and can access all of that.
[00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:17.073]  The vast amount of information we're giving up on a daily basis is insane and we're just accepting it.
[00:44:17.213 --> 00:44:18.034]  That's what this is about.
[00:44:18.114 --> 00:44:21.977]  It's not even about, you know, oh, this is some spooky app or whatever.
[00:44:21.997 --> 00:44:23.258]  It's about what we've put up with.
[00:44:23.458 --> 00:44:26.981]  And that's why it's funny, because I want to talk about this article from Gawker.
[00:44:27.161 --> 00:44:28.962]  Oh, such an amazing website, right?
[00:44:29.523 --> 00:44:37.529]  Gawker poked fun and did a parody and was like, these conspiracy theorists are afraid to give away all their information.
[00:44:37.869 --> 00:44:42.052]  It says, Pokemon Go, what you need to know about this massive mind control effort.
[00:44:42.092 --> 00:44:45.015]  It's a, it's a, you know, it's a, it's a joke.
[00:44:46.195 --> 00:44:51.679]  And what happened was they started saying, you know, people are concerned.
[00:44:51.759 --> 00:44:54.441]  It must be the evil CIA government and stuff.
[00:44:54.801 --> 00:45:06.029]  No, you're allowed to be concerned about giving your data up to these private corporations that may or may not have any affiliation with government institutions that say, we can do whatever we want with your data.
[00:45:06.049 --> 00:45:06.970]  We're going to track you.
[00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:10.792]  That's the whole point of the game, going around tracking you, getting your geolocation.
[00:45:11.113 --> 00:45:12.714]  It's okay to be upset.
[00:45:13.214 --> 00:45:18.056]  It doesn't even mean that, you know, you're not allowed to go out and have fun or play the game, whatever.
[00:45:18.096 --> 00:45:21.137]  But God, are we now just getting to the point where it's fine?
[00:45:21.637 --> 00:45:22.817]  You're crazy if you're mad about it.
[00:45:22.837 --> 00:45:25.658]  The thing is, though, it takes away from social interaction, too.
[00:45:25.698 --> 00:45:31.400]  I mean, are we going to have millions of people walking around on the streets like zombies, you know, looking at their phone?
[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:39.283]  Not only are they going to be irradiating themselves with their cell phones, but they're just going to be walking around and they're going to be living in this digital
[00:45:40.203 --> 00:45:57.790]  age in this digital fantasy land so if you look at the the mass effect of it it really takes away from who we are as the human to human interaction and you're you're bringing not only are you sharing all this information but you're bringing yourself and your life into a whole nother
[00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:59.491]  We're good to go.
[00:46:15.208 --> 00:46:16.369]  Yeah, so just beware out there.
[00:46:16.389 --> 00:46:17.550]  I drag a zombie sometimes, too.
[00:46:17.971 --> 00:46:19.392]  But anyway, all right, so that's it.
[00:46:19.452 --> 00:46:23.696]  Pokemon Go, I mean, it's an unassuming, silly little mobile game.
[00:46:23.796 --> 00:46:27.339]  But at the same time, we need to stop standing for this and, oh, everything's fine.
[00:46:27.379 --> 00:46:28.100]  Give up your data.
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:30.862]  You're a bad person and conspiracy theorist if you have a problem with it.
[00:46:31.243 --> 00:46:32.464]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi, Dr. Group.
[00:46:32.664 --> 00:46:33.124]  Thanks so much.
[00:46:33.765 --> 00:46:34.285]  Thanks, Anthony.
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:48.144]  Fool me once, shame on you.
[00:46:49.005 --> 00:46:51.449]  Fool me twice, shame on me.
[00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:59.721]  Vote for Jeb, or you're just f***ing stupid.
[00:46:59.821 --> 00:47:01.043]  Fool me, we can't get fooled again.

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.264 --> 00:48:53.545]  Well, it's an exciting day, Alex.
[00:48:53.585 --> 00:48:54.485]  I'm glad to be back with you.
[00:48:54.505 --> 00:48:55.286]  I've got to tell you the truth.
[00:49:16.755 --> 00:49:21.818]  The only reason I'm able to be with you today is living defense and brain force.
[00:49:22.278 --> 00:49:23.599]  That's how exhausted I am.
[00:49:23.719 --> 00:49:34.846]  But I've never been more excited about any campaign I've been in, and that includes the Ronald Reagan campaigns, which I'm proudest of in my entire career.
[00:49:35.666 --> 00:49:40.030]  We are literally on the verge of taking our country back.
[00:49:41.231 --> 00:49:50.779]  And as you said, Trump is now pulling ahead, or even in a number of key battleground states, the FBI giving Hillary Clinton a pass.
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:52.961]  That's not a plus, that's a minus.
[00:49:53.001 --> 00:49:54.322]  She may not be going to jail.
[00:49:55.003 --> 00:49:55.484]  Right now.
[00:50:14.745 --> 00:50:14.965]  U.S.
[00:50:14.985 --> 00:50:24.969]  Senator from Alabama, Newt Gingrich, the former Speaker, and Mike Pence are set to sit down with Donald Trump in Indianapolis.
[00:50:25.689 --> 00:50:31.972]  Senator Sessions and former Speaker Gingrich are either on their way or have just arrived there.
[00:50:32.932 --> 00:50:38.034]  I still think it may be a day or two before we have the candidate's final decision.
[00:50:38.194 --> 00:50:39.235]  Only one man knows.
[00:50:40.162 --> 00:50:42.324]  Who's going to be selected for this ticket?
[00:50:43.004 --> 00:50:44.546]  And of course, that's Donald Trump.
[00:50:44.686 --> 00:50:56.395]  Now, many years ago, former President Richard Nixon told me, on the basis of his own mistakes, look, he said, Stone, don't look for somebody who can help you.
[00:50:57.136 --> 00:50:59.438]  Just find somebody who doesn't hurt you.
[00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:09.016]  Find somebody who is solid, sure-footed, good policy background, not flashy, but somebody who doesn't hurt you.
[00:51:09.116 --> 00:51:24.347]  I think that's sound political advice because in recent times, literally in the last hundred years, with the one exception of Lyndon Johnson, I don't think you can point to any vice presidential candidate who has actually mattered.
[00:51:24.447 --> 00:51:25.008]  This race
[00:51:25.988 --> 00:51:29.911]  Is going to be about Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton.
[00:51:30.472 --> 00:51:40.659]  Now, yesterday, the Clinton people purposely floated a rumor that she was looking at a retired admiral for vice president.
[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:49.346]  We have figured out that this is an attempt to bait us in the Trump camp into the selection of General Mike Flynn.
[00:51:50.313 --> 00:51:51.834]  I think Flynn is a great man.
[00:51:51.854 --> 00:51:55.715]  I think he'd be a great addition to a Trump administration.
[00:51:56.575 --> 00:52:02.838]  I'm not sure, with the exception of Eisenhower, that generals are particularly cut out for politics.
[00:52:02.878 --> 00:52:05.138]  But he was already near the top of the list.
[00:52:05.799 --> 00:52:09.880]  He was, and it's very clear that Donald has a very high regard for it.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:16.303]  And he is the general that came out and exposed that when he was the head of defense intelligence that Obama was running ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[00:52:16.343 --> 00:52:17.163]  I mean, he's amazing.
[00:52:17.799 --> 00:52:20.360]  No, he's a gutsy, courageous guy.
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.881]  He's a patriotic American.
[00:52:21.921 --> 00:52:35.369]  Now, it's interesting that the mainstream media reported that he was a Democrat, and that he was, and they construed his comments to say that he is pro-choice.
[00:52:35.389 --> 00:52:36.369]  But he says that's not true now.
[00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:42.413]  Well, in fact, I have, and I will send this to Infowars.com, I have found his voter registration record.
[00:52:42.433 --> 00:52:43.753]  Please send it right now, that's huge.
[00:52:43.873 --> 00:52:44.334]  Virginia.
[00:52:45.074 --> 00:52:50.175]  First of all, Virginia has no voter registration, so one cannot be a Republican or a Democrat.
[00:52:50.575 --> 00:52:54.216]  However, he has voted in a prior Republican primary.
[00:52:55.316 --> 00:53:01.738]  CIA Director Flynn, Defense Secretary Flynn, I think he's headed for great things.
[00:53:02.478 --> 00:53:13.701]  My own opinion, and this is just my opinion, is that we're probably down to former Speaker Gingrich or Mike Pence, a solid conservative from Indiana.
[00:53:14.762 --> 00:53:16.023]  I have my own favorite.
[00:53:16.303 --> 00:53:19.567]  I have given the candidate my own private advice.
[00:53:19.607 --> 00:53:23.112]  I'm not going to divulge that because you know that is my policy.
[00:53:23.652 --> 00:53:25.194]  I would have preferred Jeff Sessions.
[00:53:25.595 --> 00:53:27.998]  Frankly, I think Sessions is taking himself out of it.
[00:53:28.518 --> 00:53:31.762]  But he may also end up in a Trump cabinet.
[00:53:31.842 --> 00:53:32.743]  I think the reason
[00:53:33.484 --> 00:53:38.851]  He's headed to Indianapolis is because Donald Trump values his advice so much.
[00:53:38.951 --> 00:53:40.653]  So we're very close.
[00:53:40.693 --> 00:53:41.614]  It's very exciting.
[00:53:42.215 --> 00:53:49.183]  Trump, ever the showman, tells the New York Times yesterday there may be a few people on his list that have not been publicly reported.
[00:53:50.184 --> 00:53:53.385]  And as you know, he is the king of public relations and how to get covered.
[00:53:53.465 --> 00:53:59.967]  So we're hunkered down waiting for a decision, but we won't know until the candidate himself makes a decision.
[00:53:59.987 --> 00:54:05.549]  And my own personal view is as this moment, I'm not sure a final decision is made.
[00:54:05.629 --> 00:54:07.149]  That's why he's meeting with the threes.
[00:54:07.169 --> 00:54:12.031]  Probably also seeing if they'll work with him, if he picks one of them and the others are then put in cabinet positions.
[00:54:12.811 --> 00:54:13.431]  Here's my issue.
[00:54:13.471 --> 00:54:14.572]  I don't like to be Machiavellian.
[00:54:14.712 --> 00:54:17.212]  I certainly can do it just as good as anybody can.
[00:54:17.733 --> 00:54:19.073]  I'm almost ashamed of myself for that fact.
[00:54:19.093 --> 00:54:20.994]  I can get in that headspace at a pretty deep level.
[00:54:22.927 --> 00:54:29.336]  Obviously at a sick level, I'd like him to pick Gingrich because the establishment wouldn't be so scared because of Gingrich's globalist connections.
[00:54:29.376 --> 00:54:30.197]  I've read his writings.
[00:54:30.678 --> 00:54:36.085]  I mean, this guy on the service is this populist conservative, but I mean, he really is the guy that gave us Boehner, all of it.
[00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:37.888]  He's got some major problems, but...
[00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:42.973]  I see the fact that that might make the establishment be as scared of Trump.
[00:54:43.253 --> 00:54:45.755]  Then I worry about Trump getting assassinated if he puts Gingrich in.
[00:54:46.055 --> 00:54:48.477]  So in a Machiavellian way, I say, okay, I want Trump to win.
[00:54:48.517 --> 00:54:49.318]  I hate Hillary so much.
[00:54:49.638 --> 00:54:50.319]  Go with Gingrich.
[00:54:50.639 --> 00:54:54.542]  But just, I tell you, it'll be the first thing Trump's done that is establishment-esque.
[00:54:54.682 --> 00:55:01.828]  If he does, I would like a Sessions, even if it's politically incorrect and they try to, you know, attack him just from Alabama or stuff 40 years ago.
[00:55:02.749 --> 00:55:04.970]  Or, you know, somebody like a General Flynn.
[00:55:05.011 --> 00:55:05.571]  That's my take.
[00:55:05.591 --> 00:55:06.572]  What's your take, Roger Stone?
[00:55:07.045 --> 00:55:08.967]  Well, you're almost reading my mind, Alex.
[00:55:08.987 --> 00:55:17.518]  You know, when I used to bring up Gingrich with former President Nixon, he would just snort and say, Rockefeller guy, which tells me a lot.
[00:55:17.718 --> 00:55:21.363]  Newt, by the way, did run Nelson Rockefeller's campaign in Georgia in 1968.
[00:55:25.588 --> 00:55:28.170]  I, my own personal view is I agree with you.
[00:55:28.210 --> 00:55:29.591]  First of all, I love Jeff Sessions.
[00:55:29.651 --> 00:55:31.192]  He would be my first choice.
[00:55:32.073 --> 00:55:37.297]  But I'm for whoever Donald Trump is for, and I put my total faith in Trump.
[00:55:37.457 --> 00:55:38.958]  I don't think we're going to get a globalist.
[00:55:39.578 --> 00:55:44.742]  I don't think we're going to get somebody who doesn't adhere strictly to the Trump agenda.
[00:55:44.762 --> 00:55:46.103]  Oh yeah, they're licking their lips, man.
[00:55:46.143 --> 00:55:49.646]  He brings Genrich in, that fox sitting there smiling at him like he's a big fat hen.
[00:55:49.666 --> 00:55:51.748]  I mean, Trump's got to be, I know Trump's smart.
[00:55:51.768 --> 00:55:53.389]  He just, he's crazy if he puts Genrich in.
[00:55:54.930 --> 00:56:02.672]  Nobody recognizes this, but I don't think any candidate for president in our lifetime has wanted to be upstaged.
[00:56:03.972 --> 00:56:06.313]  And I think Newt may have that tendency.
[00:56:06.353 --> 00:56:07.473]  He's a very smart guy.
[00:56:07.533 --> 00:56:09.294]  He's a very glib guy.
[00:56:09.334 --> 00:56:13.875]  In fact, I can't think of any subject on which Newt doesn't consider himself an expert.
[00:56:14.035 --> 00:56:18.176]  So, you know, Trump, I think, understands the correct role.
[00:56:19.119 --> 00:56:19.299]  All right.
[00:56:31.638 --> 00:56:33.900]  To the Democrats, and specifically to the Clintons.
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:36.581]  And we know that Newt Gingrich can get under the Clintons' skin.
[00:56:37.342 --> 00:56:42.405]  I would counter-argue that Trump's own pugnacious style makes that unnecessary.
[00:56:42.785 --> 00:56:44.406]  He's not afraid to take on the Clintons.
[00:56:44.446 --> 00:56:47.889]  He's taken them on ad nauseum, and he's going to take them on.
[00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:54.373]  Sure, you can also argue he knows all the Washington insiders, and suddenly the big money will come to him, but that's going to come with strengths.
[00:56:55.506 --> 00:56:58.808]  Well, look, this campaign's never going to be funded by big money.
[00:56:59.008 --> 00:57:00.669]  It's never going to be funded by Wall Street.
[00:57:00.729 --> 00:57:08.234]  What's amazing is that in the month of June, the campaign raised $51 million, mostly from small donors.
[00:57:08.934 --> 00:57:09.655]  The 25s, the 100s.
[00:57:09.955 --> 00:57:13.057]  Let me raise this with you, then, Roger Stone's our guest on Zone.com.
[00:57:13.957 --> 00:57:15.818]  What do we do to reach out to the Sanders people?
[00:57:15.858 --> 00:57:27.002]  I don't see how they stole the delegates, they stole the superdelegates, they robbed him, they chose that Hillary would win the day before with voter news services, the AP, the primary was a simulation for Democrats.
[00:57:27.422 --> 00:57:39.546]  How could Sanders supporters, I mean a good chunk, 30-40%, how could they not vote so they at least in the institution of voting, how could they let a new Politburo, the Democratic Party, the Central Committee do this?
[00:57:39.606 --> 00:57:40.547]  I mean it just seems like
[00:57:41.147 --> 00:57:44.970]  Yeah, I think one of the keys, of course, Alex, is picking a running mate who was not a cheerleader for the Iraq War.
[00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:46.491]  The opening here is that
[00:58:02.302 --> 00:58:03.003]  Is that true?
[00:58:16.658 --> 00:58:17.879]  Endorsing Hillary Clinton.
[00:58:17.899 --> 00:58:26.106]  Because it means that everything he said in his campaign about values and progressive values and principle, it was all BS!
[00:58:26.646 --> 00:58:32.271]  Bernie Sanders, with his Doc Brown hairdo, turns out to be just another corporate whore!
[00:58:32.631 --> 00:58:34.553]  Just another slave for Wall Street.
[00:58:34.673 --> 00:58:37.035]  Very, very disappointing.
[00:58:37.682 --> 00:58:40.403]  I thought that at least he was a man of principle.
[00:58:40.843 --> 00:58:46.145]  Perhaps leftist principles, but, you know, not motivated by money and greed and power.
[00:58:46.165 --> 00:58:48.226]  And that's it for our show tonight.
