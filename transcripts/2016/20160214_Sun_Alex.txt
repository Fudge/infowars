[00:00:15.544 --> 00:00:20.526]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:20.526 --> 00:00:28.469]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:30.970]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on the Sunday, February 14th, 2016.
[00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:50.531]  Yesterday was a big news day, of course, the death of Antonin Scalia, the intellectual heart of the Supreme Court, I would say, one of the key intellectuals of the conservative movement, and I would say not even conservative movement, the constitutional movement.
[00:00:50.531 --> 00:00:59.837]  This is somebody who cared very deeply that we interpret the Constitution as it is written, an originalist, and he will be sorely missed, but of course,
[00:01:00.797 --> 00:01:03.978]  There are questions surrounding the circumstances of his death.
[00:01:03.978 --> 00:01:08.681]  We're going to have a special report from Alex Jones coming up in the next segment.
[00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:11.202]  And then we also had the GOP debate last night.
[00:01:11.202 --> 00:01:19.145]  We're going to be talking about that, as well as analyzing what will happen now with the Supreme Court in the absence of Antonin Scalia.
[00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:25.148]  You know, when we look at this televised debate last night, I think one of the key things that stuck out to me, of course, is this back and forth booing.
[00:01:25.768 --> 00:01:28.449]  We knew the RNC was going to stack the audience.
[00:01:28.449 --> 00:01:35.751]  There's an article from Salon Trump and Drudge for the win, however, Matt Drudge's army is bigger than the RNC.
[00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:42.954]  We have seen poll after poll on the internet, not just Drudge's, but many other polls that show this tactic didn't work.
[00:01:42.954 --> 00:01:43.874]  What it really was
[00:01:44.474 --> 00:01:47.196]  Was a televised push poll.
[00:01:47.196 --> 00:01:56.804]  That's where you call up somebody at the very last minute, put out some negative information, do it in the form of a question, so that you can character assassinate someone at the very last minute.
[00:01:56.804 --> 00:02:02.209]  That's what that was last night with a live audience with the laugh track, I should say, with the boo track.
[00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.829]  But before we...
[00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.871]  Get off on that, and we're going to talk about Antonin Scalia, and that's going to be coming up next in the next segment.
[00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:18.553]  I want to play for you, for many of those of you who say, well, let's not ever question that our government be capable of doing something like assassinating somebody for political purposes.
[00:02:18.553 --> 00:02:23.494]  Let's go back 41 years to the church committee hearings, and this is what they had to say then.
[00:02:23.494 --> 00:02:27.095]  So I had to find, one time they wanted me to find
[00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:33.023]  To find out if there was such a thing as a poison that was undetectable.
[00:02:33.023 --> 00:02:36.606]  Especially one that seemed to mimic a heart attack.
[00:02:37.643 --> 00:02:41.365]  That would kill someone, but it would appear that they had a heart attack.
[00:02:41.365 --> 00:02:42.946]  I did find such a thing.
[00:02:42.946 --> 00:02:46.827]  Does this pistol fire the dart?
[00:02:46.827 --> 00:02:56.432]  Yes, it does, Mr. Chairman, and a special one was developed which potentially would be able to enter the target without perception.
[00:02:56.432 --> 00:03:01.054]  The poison was frozen into some sort of dart, and then it was shot.
[00:03:02.094 --> 00:03:14.318]  Uh, very high speed into the person so when it reached the person it would melt inside them and the only thing would be like one little tiny red dot on their body which is hard to detect.
[00:03:14.318 --> 00:03:17.820]  There wouldn't be a needle left or anything like that in the person.
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.761]  But also the toxin itself would not appear in the autopsy?
[00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:27.663]  Yes, so that there was no way of perceiving that the target was him.
[00:03:27.663 --> 00:03:28.744]  Have you brought with you
[00:03:30.718 --> 00:03:42.481]  Some of those devices which would have enabled the CIA to use this poison for, we have indeed, for killing people.
[00:03:42.481 --> 00:03:45.322]  The round thing at the top is obviously the sight.
[00:03:45.322 --> 00:03:46.582]  It works by electricity.
[00:03:46.582 --> 00:03:51.444]  There's a battery in the handle and it fires a small dart.
[00:03:51.444 --> 00:03:54.044]  And the dart itself, when it strikes the target,
[00:03:58.361 --> 00:04:02.644]  Does the target know that he's been hit and about to die?
[00:04:02.644 --> 00:04:10.310]  A special one was developed which potentially would be able to enter the target without perception.
[00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.013]  As a murder instrument, that's about as efficient as you can get, isn't it?
[00:04:15.013 --> 00:04:16.935]  It is a weapon, a very serious weapon.
[00:04:18.277 --> 00:04:23.724]  So that's William Colby, the then-director of the CIA, talking to the Church Committee hearings.
[00:04:23.724 --> 00:04:26.807]  There also were House Committee hearings by Pike.
[00:04:26.807 --> 00:04:30.191]  He said they had a heart attack gun 41 years ago.
[00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:33.495]  They could use it to take out political enemies, but of course...
[00:04:34.136 --> 00:04:36.098]  The CIA was very embarrassed about that.
[00:04:36.098 --> 00:04:41.043]  They're not even embarrassed about their disposition matrix, about the policies of assassination.
[00:04:41.043 --> 00:04:42.805]  So it's a legitimate question.
[00:04:42.805 --> 00:04:46.009]  Ask what happened to Supreme Court Justice Scalia.
[00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.932]  Alex Jones will be with us coming up to break that down farther.
[00:04:59.295 --> 00:05:03.658]  I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
[00:05:03.658 --> 00:05:05.459]  Ooh, feel the burn.
[00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:10.622]  Again, Hillary Clinton's face went as green as her chartreuse Chairman Mao pantsuit.
[00:05:10.622 --> 00:05:16.506]  When Bernie Sanders isn't talking about raising taxes and giving away free stuff, he sometimes makes some good points.
[00:05:16.826 --> 00:05:22.729]  Sanders noted that Kissinger paved the way for one of the worst instances of genocide in modern history.
[00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:29.972]  Last week, Clinton declared that she was very flattered when Henry Kissinger said, Clinton has admitted that she is working toward Kissinger's envisioned global architecture.
[00:05:36.175 --> 00:05:40.219]  But actually, we do know who earns Bernie Sanders' foreign policy praise.
[00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:43.782]  The Castro regime and Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
[00:05:43.782 --> 00:05:46.464]  Sanders gets kudos for disavowing the establishment.
[00:05:46.464 --> 00:05:54.292]  But in the next breath, he vowed to subvert the Constitution by ignoring Congress and going even further than Obama has in using executive action.
[00:05:54.292 --> 00:05:56.634]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com
[00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:23.193]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[00:06:23.193 --> 00:06:25.876]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:25.876 --> 00:06:29.259]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday, February 14th, 2016.
[00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:31.521]  I am David Knight, here live.
[00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:35.224]  We have a report from Alex Jones about the sudden death of Antonin Scalia.
[00:06:35.885 --> 00:06:37.825]  Of course, we have an article up on Infowars.com.
[00:06:37.825 --> 00:06:41.006]  A Texas judge turns down a Scalia autopsy.
[00:06:41.006 --> 00:06:43.947]  This judge did not even see the body.
[00:06:43.947 --> 00:07:01.691]  Another judge who was reached later said, I would have wanted to have an autopsy, certainly for someone who is this politically important and in the context of what has just happened with recent Supreme Court decisions in terms of the coal industry affecting Obama's climate change agenda.
[00:07:01.691 --> 00:07:03.671]  Here's Alex Jones breaking this down farther.
[00:07:05.572 --> 00:07:16.602]  Was the death of Anthony Scalia yesterday in rural southwest Texas foul play?
[00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:24.409]  Well, of course you ask that question if a top Supreme Court justice dies or if a president suddenly dies.
[00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:32.476]  And you really ask that question if the first report out of ABC News affiliate
[00:07:34.705 --> 00:07:51.681]  In South Texas in a tiny town and then repeated by the ABC News affiliate in San Antonio, Texas, just south of where I'm broadcasting from right now, the first reports come out and say he has died and it does not appear to be foul play.
[00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:52.842]  No more information.
[00:07:53.857 --> 00:07:57.600]  That is unprecedented when you study assassinations.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.101]  That is what they do.
[00:07:59.101 --> 00:08:03.465]  When there is a normal death, it says, well, the coroner's report will come out.
[00:08:03.465 --> 00:08:05.646]  We're not sure, but he was 79.
[00:08:05.646 --> 00:08:08.909]  But you don't say, appeared to be natural.
[00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:09.850]  Same thing happened with Breitbart.
[00:08:10.922 --> 00:08:26.254]  And so many times with political assassinations in Arkansas that we saw in Arkansas with the Clintons and their medical examiner, where people have arms and legs chopped off, dozens of bullet wounds found in garbage bags, chopped up, and they would say they killed themselves.
[00:08:26.254 --> 00:08:33.339]  Or the CIA, the author that exposed the CIA, the journalist Gary Webb, who shot himself twice in the head.
[00:08:33.339 --> 00:08:35.721]  I talked to him weeks before.
[00:08:35.721 --> 00:08:38.323]  And he said he was having to move because people were breaking into his house.
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.903]  And of course, Kill the Messenger came out and basically shows how they murdered him.
[00:08:43.903 --> 00:08:58.515]  So, they've killed so many people, they've done so much, why wouldn't they get rid of this key conservative Supreme Court Justice who was holding back the gun bans, the carbon taxes, the open borders.
[00:08:58.515 --> 00:09:03.119]  I mean, you name it, he was probably the only person on there that couldn't be blackmailed.
[00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:06.042]  You notice that Roberts was against Obamacare and then suddenly switched for it.
[00:09:07.014 --> 00:09:07.134]  Yeah.
[00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:30.871]  This is the key.
[00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:39.376]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been rumored to be preparing to step down so that Obama can have the nominee before he leaves.
[00:09:39.376 --> 00:09:41.417]  She's been holding on.
[00:09:41.417 --> 00:09:43.478]  She was appointed in 93 by Bill Clinton.
[00:09:43.478 --> 00:09:47.220]  That will give them not one new appointee, but two.
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:55.223]  That's why out of the gates, Mitch McConnell and others came out and did the right thing and said, we're going to block this completely.
[00:09:55.223 --> 00:09:57.905]  And we saw Clinton and others
[00:10:00.493 --> 00:10:03.934]  And the Democrats sit there and try to block Republican judges as well.
[00:10:03.934 --> 00:10:08.716]  And we've seen Democratic presidents block in their last year what the Republicans are up to.
[00:10:08.716 --> 00:10:12.317]  So it's gone both ways here.
[00:10:12.317 --> 00:10:21.080]  The issue is, though, it is a 5-4 split on these issues now that Scalia is gone.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.801]  And they put in who Obama wants.
[00:10:22.801 --> 00:10:27.663]  They now can win and get every decision the way they want it.
[00:10:28.743 --> 00:10:40.524]  So the Republican House and the Republican Senate absolutely under the Constitution have the right and the duty under the Separation of Powers Clause that when things are out of control on a court to block
[00:10:41.753 --> 00:10:45.674]  Someone being confirmed to it to stop a takeover.
[00:10:45.674 --> 00:10:48.595]  That's why they control the confirmation process.
[00:10:48.595 --> 00:10:51.376]  And they're saying, hey, we're waiting until the election in eight months.
[00:10:51.376 --> 00:10:53.177]  We're not letting you do this right now.
[00:10:53.177 --> 00:10:54.758]  And then we'll have a battle later.
[00:10:54.758 --> 00:10:56.838]  And that is absolutely what needs to happen.
[00:10:56.838 --> 00:11:04.281]  The centralization of power in the executive and the Supreme Court more and more trying to go with executive power and totalitarianism is so frightening.
[00:11:05.211 --> 00:11:12.481]  And again, we've seen the Democrats in the House and Senate when Bush was trying to appoint someone, blocking them in his last year.
[00:11:12.481 --> 00:11:14.263]  So the President's there, but watch the Democrats.
[00:11:14.263 --> 00:11:15.946]  They're saying, oh, it's unconstitutional.
[00:11:15.946 --> 00:11:16.687]  You can't do this.
[00:11:16.687 --> 00:11:18.128]  You can't do that.
[00:11:18.128 --> 00:11:21.233]  So this is a big, big deal right now.
[00:11:21.233 --> 00:11:22.494]  So let me go ahead and show folks.
[00:11:23.962 --> 00:11:37.351]  This photo here, and for radio listeners we'll break it down, here is the Supreme Court Justice that died yesterday, Anthony Scalia, the most conservative member of the court, not perfect, but way better than Sotomayor or Kagan or Ruth Bader Ginsburg or any of these other people.
[00:11:37.351 --> 00:11:50.561]  And the only other person that was decent on the court is Clarence Thomas, and this guy has been warning of the tyranny in this country, and I also wish I could tell you the inside baseball I know from folks that know members of the Supreme Court, but I'm just going to leave it at that and tell you that
[00:11:51.321 --> 00:12:06.633]  Obviously, one of the conservative justices told Matt Drudge last year at dinner, they've told us in 2016 they're coming after the Second Amendment, free speech, basically everything, and that nothing can stop it because they're going to have more justices in.
[00:12:06.633 --> 00:12:10.496]  But then they were doing the math saying, but if we stay in, you won't have the justices.
[00:12:10.496 --> 00:12:12.077]  Oh, but Ginsburg's going to leave.
[00:12:12.077 --> 00:12:16.080]  Well, she still votes liberal or socialist or command and control.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.822]  So what are you going to do now?
[00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:19.603]  What are you going to do?
[00:12:21.537 --> 00:12:23.540]  Oh, Scalia dies.
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.403]  And oh, he's 79.
[00:12:25.403 --> 00:12:27.886]  Yeah, maybe he did die of natural causes.
[00:12:27.886 --> 00:12:32.172]  But then they tell you right away, no foul play, don't investigate, nothing to see here.
[00:12:32.172 --> 00:12:34.114]  That's the big tell-tale sign.
[00:12:34.114 --> 00:12:35.456]  But how far are we into this transmission?
[00:12:36.817 --> 00:12:47.102]  Good, because I'm going to throw it at break and come back with a special report I taped last night on the fall of Western Civilization, the global collapse that's financially accelerating and now being admitted, and a lot more.
[00:12:47.102 --> 00:12:48.583]  And then David Knight's coming up live.
[00:12:48.583 --> 00:12:53.285]  But I want to continue here with this information.
[00:12:53.285 --> 00:12:55.486]  Scalia is dead.
[00:12:55.486 --> 00:12:59.708]  Now they're going to be able to put in their globalist, their operative, their totalitarian under left cover.
[00:13:01.035 --> 00:13:09.999]  Well, they're leering into totalitarianism, and then Ginsburg's leaving, they'll get their other person in, boom, a total takeover of the court, they will be able to reverse everything.
[00:13:09.999 --> 00:13:17.102]  Hey, I wonder if Clarence Thomas, he's old too, I wonder if he just dies of a heart attack, you know, in a week or two, or maybe in a car wreck, it's run over.
[00:13:17.102 --> 00:13:20.444]  We'll just be told instantly when it's announced, no foul play.
[00:13:20.444 --> 00:13:27.527]  In fact, if they don't say no foul play, that would make you think, just nothing to see here, appears to be completely natural, everything's fine.
[00:13:29.807 --> 00:13:39.290]  With all the other rigging and corruption, the government funding Al-Qaeda, ordering stand-downs at Benghazi, and all the rigging of the stock market, all of it admitted now.
[00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:43.911]  And saying it doesn't matter if Bernie Sanders wins the popular vote, Hillary has the delegates, you know.
[00:13:43.911 --> 00:13:45.212]  Just all of it in our face now.
[00:13:47.062 --> 00:13:48.985]  Now let's go over the rest of these articles.
[00:13:48.985 --> 00:13:51.689]  Again, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, folks, appointed in 93.
[00:13:51.689 --> 00:13:53.491]  Look for that by Clinton.
[00:13:53.491 --> 00:13:56.415]  And look for them to try now if she steps down to bring somebody else in.
[00:13:56.415 --> 00:13:58.358]  But they don't even need her.
[00:13:58.358 --> 00:14:00.962]  Now that Scalia has died, we must block the
[00:14:02.589 --> 00:14:08.597]  Even bringing forward the nomination and then even having the congressional hearings for the confirmation.
[00:14:08.597 --> 00:14:11.601]  Just don't even allow the hearings for the confirmation.
[00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:13.624]  Completely, absolutely block it.
[00:14:13.624 --> 00:14:15.626]  This is the report that's coming up.
[00:14:15.626 --> 00:14:18.210]  Global Ruin is coming unless we stop it.
[00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:19.331]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[00:14:20.132 --> 00:14:21.595]  We have this report I shot last night.
[00:14:21.595 --> 00:14:23.517]  Supreme Court Justice Scalia dead.
[00:14:23.517 --> 00:14:25.260]  Is Clarence Thomas next?
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:30.007]  They're already indicting all these Republican governors and Republican filmmakers and conservative libertarians.
[00:14:30.007 --> 00:14:35.194]  They're already indicted the Texas Attorney General that's suing Obama over abortion, open borders and gun control.
[00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:41.778]  I mean, they're already engaged in a huge political war on every single front.
[00:14:41.778 --> 00:14:44.439]  So why would we not question?
[00:14:44.439 --> 00:14:51.042]  Why would we not at least say there'll be an investigation and the coroner should let us know in a few weeks?
[00:14:51.042 --> 00:14:51.923]  Because in any other death,
[00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:54.706]  They always say it takes a few weeks.
[00:14:54.706 --> 00:14:57.488]  They even have state laws in many states that it's two weeks to a month.
[00:14:57.488 --> 00:15:01.250]  So that people can't just pass through murders and say nothing happened here.
[00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.051]  There's a reason we have medical examiners.
[00:15:03.051 --> 00:15:04.412]  There's a reason we have coroners.
[00:15:04.412 --> 00:15:07.633]  It's a reason they're independent in the county and the city level.
[00:15:07.633 --> 00:15:08.534]  They're watchdogs.
[00:15:08.534 --> 00:15:09.695]  They're absolutely important.
[00:15:09.695 --> 00:15:20.601]  And I demand that the media, the whore media, that's dying because no one trusts you, to do your job and at least come out and say, hey, will foul play be investigated?
[00:15:21.221 --> 00:15:24.544]  Could there be someone that might want to sway the Supreme Court?
[00:15:24.544 --> 00:15:28.186]  We all know in mafia cases, even state courts have judges shot and killed.
[00:15:28.186 --> 00:15:33.370]  We just had a top state judge in Austin shot, and it's mafia connected, a few months ago.
[00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.492]  They instantly said, you know, mob connected.
[00:15:36.492 --> 00:15:44.618]  We have judges dying, you know, in their sleep, and they have big investigations because they're sitting over key hearings and in key rulings.
[00:15:44.618 --> 00:15:48.801]  This is the Supreme Court, and where there are investigations with all the other lower courts.
[00:15:49.301 --> 00:15:51.203]  Alright, that's the report from Alex Jones.
[00:15:51.203 --> 00:15:54.146]  You can find that on our YouTube channel.
[00:15:54.146 --> 00:15:58.129]  And we're going to be coming back right after the break with this report on Global Ruin.
[00:15:58.129 --> 00:15:59.450]  I've been working all day.
[00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.532]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[00:16:01.532 --> 00:16:02.413]  I get in here at 8.30.
[00:16:12.202 --> 00:16:13.543]  I was kind of run down.
[00:16:13.543 --> 00:16:15.484]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[00:16:15.484 --> 00:16:17.346]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[00:16:17.346 --> 00:16:19.187]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:20.248]  I popped two of them.
[00:16:20.248 --> 00:16:22.529]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[00:16:22.529 --> 00:16:24.490]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:25.991]  It's got four and a half stars.
[00:16:25.991 --> 00:16:27.312]  People really love it.
[00:16:27.312 --> 00:16:27.913]  Read about it.
[00:16:27.913 --> 00:16:31.755]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[00:16:31.755 --> 00:16:37.019]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[00:16:37.219 --> 00:16:41.244]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[00:16:41.244 --> 00:16:47.392]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[00:16:47.392 --> 00:16:53.299]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:16:57.577 --> 00:16:58.497]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:16:58.497 --> 00:16:59.077]  Good, brother.
[00:16:59.077 --> 00:17:01.018]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:17:01.018 --> 00:17:02.739]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:17:02.739 --> 00:17:06.800]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.381]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:17:09.381 --> 00:17:11.821]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:17:11.821 --> 00:17:19.724]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:17:19.984 --> 00:17:23.228]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:17:23.228 --> 00:17:24.770]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:27.694]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:17:27.694 --> 00:17:29.456]  Saving a ton of money there.
[00:17:29.456 --> 00:17:32.200]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.264]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[00:17:35.524 --> 00:17:37.305]  Or maximum potency.
[00:17:37.305 --> 00:17:43.768]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience.
[00:17:43.768 --> 00:17:47.509]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[00:17:47.509 --> 00:17:49.310]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:56.233]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:17:59.961 --> 00:18:03.743]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:18:03.743 --> 00:18:11.468]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:18:11.468 --> 00:18:18.832]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own.
[00:18:18.832 --> 00:18:20.113]  Air raid sirens.
[00:18:20.113 --> 00:18:24.516]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:18:24.516 --> 00:18:26.697]  Pathenogens added to the food and water.
[00:18:26.957 --> 00:18:34.344]  To the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:18:34.344 --> 00:18:37.748]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[00:18:37.748 --> 00:18:48.799]  AnthroPlex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[00:18:48.899 --> 00:18:51.781]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.
[00:18:51.781 --> 00:18:54.863]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[00:18:54.863 --> 00:18:58.486]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[00:18:58.486 --> 00:18:59.587]  Brain force is here.
[00:18:59.587 --> 00:19:01.808]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:06.812]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of brain force.
[00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:10.094]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:19:10.094 --> 00:19:13.577]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:19:13.577 --> 00:19:15.318]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:19:15.538 --> 00:19:16.459]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:19:16.459 --> 00:19:17.660]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:19.642]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[00:19:19.642 --> 00:19:28.310]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:29.230]  Shower filters.
[00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:30.952]  We're introducing the best yet.
[00:19:30.952 --> 00:19:35.016]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[00:19:35.016 --> 00:19:39.840]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.002]  This new four-stage filtration process
[00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:43.563]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:20.419]  People living in the United States especially, in the last hundred years, have gone through a lot less hardship than other people around the world.
[00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:42.452]  An example is 20 million Germans died in World War II.
[00:20:42.452 --> 00:20:43.833]  20 million Russians as well.
[00:20:43.833 --> 00:20:48.655]  If you want to be technical, 21 million Germans, 20 million Russians.
[00:20:48.655 --> 00:21:01.102]  The Soviets in Russia, Ukraine, and Poland alone are estimated over 70 years to have killed more than 100 million of their own people.
[00:21:01.102 --> 00:21:02.303]  Why am I bringing that up?
[00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:06.171]  There are different types of government in history.
[00:21:06.171 --> 00:21:10.192]  There are governments of conquest and governments of innovation.
[00:21:10.192 --> 00:21:14.954]  And normally governments and systems are a mix of those two.
[00:21:14.954 --> 00:21:21.037]  I've talked a lot about this, but we are now entering a phase in the global historical cycle
[00:21:22.765 --> 00:21:35.793]  That even mainline sociologists and historians are saying looks like the most dangerous, violent, cataclysmic period the world has ever seen.
[00:21:35.793 --> 00:21:38.775]  Dozens of nations are in flames.
[00:21:38.775 --> 00:21:42.738]  Scores of nations are in the middle of civil wars.
[00:21:42.738 --> 00:21:47.461]  ISIS and Al Qaeda groups have invaded more than 14 countries in the last five years.
[00:21:49.352 --> 00:21:56.398]  In the West, we give up our liberties and then are targeted by the security state that supposedly is there to keep us safe.
[00:21:56.398 --> 00:21:58.479]  What am I getting at here?
[00:21:58.479 --> 00:22:01.542]  We're entering a very important time.
[00:22:01.542 --> 00:22:09.828]  And the globalists that sit above the nation states have exempted themselves from our laws, from our taxes.
[00:22:09.828 --> 00:22:13.551]  They have given themselves diplomatic and corporate immunity.
[00:22:13.551 --> 00:22:15.392]  And we talk a lot about that.
[00:22:15.392 --> 00:22:17.314]  But what I want to impart to you is this.
[00:22:20.902 --> 00:22:25.948]  And your family are being targeted by globalism.
[00:22:25.948 --> 00:22:30.454]  Globalism is the most evil political system the world has ever seen.
[00:22:30.454 --> 00:22:31.675]  It uses fascism.
[00:22:31.675 --> 00:22:36.421]  It uses other forms of collectivism like communism and socialism.
[00:22:36.421 --> 00:22:38.864]  It uses command and control systems.
[00:22:39.969 --> 00:22:49.973]  That it plays off against each other to consolidate power and most importantly, impoverish the people of those nations and regions.
[00:22:49.973 --> 00:22:58.597]  Now, Carol Quigley, who was a top globalist advisor and the head of political science at Georgetown, in the 60s wrote a book called Tragedy and Hope.
[00:22:58.597 --> 00:22:59.878]  Much of it's online for free.
[00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:00.498]  Go read it.
[00:23:00.498 --> 00:23:04.079]  Where they admit all of this.
[00:23:04.079 --> 00:23:06.921]  The book was only meant for State Department and CIA officials.
[00:23:06.921 --> 00:23:07.361]  It got out.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:12.462]  That was so they could understand, why do we support communism and fascism?
[00:23:12.462 --> 00:23:15.444]  Why do we support dictators over elected governments?
[00:23:15.444 --> 00:23:17.865]  Why are we supposedly the good guys, but we do this?
[00:23:17.865 --> 00:23:20.206]  And, quickly explained, we are globalists.
[00:23:20.206 --> 00:23:22.167]  This is a world system.
[00:23:22.167 --> 00:23:23.808]  We're getting rid of nation-states.
[00:23:23.808 --> 00:23:27.249]  Join it, or be the enemy.
[00:23:27.249 --> 00:23:36.534]  There are so many quotes from congressional hearings where they openly admit that, yes, we're bringing in a planetary government, and you will either join the New World Order, or die!
[00:23:38.749 --> 00:23:49.245]  But then they have pop culture for decades, demonizing everyone from Barry Goldwater through Ron Paul to myself today, who warns of this, a corporate takeover.
[00:23:50.430 --> 00:24:00.418]  That is designed not to just take over and have you work for it, but is designed to come in and destroy industrial and agrarian farming bases.
[00:24:00.418 --> 00:24:03.460]  And make all nations dependent on each other.
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:10.746]  Not to bring about harmony, but to bring about control for the globalists who sit above the nations, playing the nations off against each other.
[00:24:10.746 --> 00:24:14.729]  And in their own writings they say they want you to be poor.
[00:24:14.729 --> 00:24:16.230]  They want you to be dumbed down.
[00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:17.411]  They don't want you to have health care.
[00:24:18.629 --> 00:24:30.513]  That's why Obama again goes to Africa and other countries and regions and continents, in the case of Africa, and says, you can't have air conditioning, you can't have a car.
[00:24:30.513 --> 00:24:42.038]  If everybody's raising living standards to the point where everybody's got a car and everybody's got air conditioning and everybody's got a big house, well, the planet will boil over.
[00:24:42.038 --> 00:24:44.799]  As if the idea of progress itself is bad.
[00:24:45.896 --> 00:24:53.931]  But you see, the idea of progress is bad when we have it, because it makes us independent of their monopoly of control.
[00:24:53.931 --> 00:24:56.216]  You and your family are faced with a total tyranny.
[00:24:57.356 --> 00:25:01.518]  I am faced with a total tyranny, a scientifically organized plan of control.
[00:25:01.518 --> 00:25:12.403]  The only way to defeat it is to admit it's taking place and to withdraw your cultural and financial and also spiritual support from it and to speak out against it.
[00:25:12.403 --> 00:25:17.005]  It will fall, but notice its whole system is about saying it doesn't exist.
[00:25:17.865 --> 00:25:26.051]  Just like the Federal Reserve isn't private, or just like glyphosate doesn't give you cancer, or just like if you have a business you didn't build that.
[00:25:26.051 --> 00:25:32.736]  They attack logic and common sense to make you feel like you're alone.
[00:25:32.736 --> 00:25:36.159]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached a turning point.
[00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:37.500]  We have reached the crossroads.
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:41.043]  We have reached the point where the final globalist wave is coming in.
[00:25:42.429 --> 00:25:47.951]  And if we don't speak out and oppose it now, we're going to go into fantastical tyranny.
[00:25:47.951 --> 00:25:57.715]  Look at how they just admit that the delegate process is rigged and that even though Bernie Sanders won in New Hampshire, Hillary got more delegates.
[00:25:57.715 --> 00:26:07.098]  Look at how they just come out now federally and say your kids do belong to the state and every family will have a government agent assigned to their children from birth.
[00:26:07.098 --> 00:26:08.238]  This is the stuff of 1984!
[00:26:11.468 --> 00:26:17.130]  And it's being brought out to make us submit, to break our will, to make us give into it.
[00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:18.710]  And we can't let that happen.
[00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:27.993]  Look at how Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton constantly attack Wall Street and capitalism as if it created the economic crisis we're now in.
[00:26:30.039 --> 00:26:40.731]  90 plus percent of Wall Street is doing a great job capitalizing companies, capitalizing systems, giving people great returns on their 401ks, and similar systems.
[00:26:40.731 --> 00:26:48.740]  It's only the top five or six mega banks and brokerage firms that created the derivatives that brought in all the fraud, and they're the very ones that fund Hillary Clinton.
[00:26:49.401 --> 00:27:07.989]  And Bernie Sanders, the Democratic Party, and most of the Republican Party, because they're the monopoly men, scapegoating real capitalism for their crony, capitalist, rigged system that Carol Quigley, one of their own top strategists, laid out for them in the 1960s.
[00:27:07.989 --> 00:27:10.610]  They are bringing us despotism.
[00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:12.111]  They want to make you poor.
[00:27:13.211 --> 00:27:19.215]  They want to dumb you and your family down, and they teach you to be cynical about this and make jokes about it.
[00:27:19.215 --> 00:27:25.100]  The only way you have power is to admit this is happening, and to stand up against it, and to say no.
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.742]  And the good news is, the numbers have never been clearer.
[00:27:28.642 --> 00:27:31.986]  People are really ready to wake up now.
[00:27:31.986 --> 00:27:43.779]  Folks are beginning to understand what's happening, but they're getting caught in different bait-and-switches, like Hillary and Bernie Sanders are putting out, to confuse people where we blame capitalism during this collapse.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:54.108]  And then bring in more collectivism instead of pointing out the collectivism is what allowed this system to get in this position that it's now in.
[00:27:54.108 --> 00:28:01.615]  They plan on using the crises that they have exacerbated and created to bring us to our knees.
[00:28:01.615 --> 00:28:02.416]  They plan to
[00:28:04.224 --> 00:28:10.168]  Not let the public know there's a global financial collapse until people are so desperate they come in with their answers.
[00:28:10.168 --> 00:28:18.473]  That is a global government with a global carbon tax of 100 trillion every decade paid to these pirate criminals that are above the law.
[00:28:18.473 --> 00:28:20.015]  That is outrageous.
[00:28:20.015 --> 00:28:21.215]  We'll be back right after break.
[00:28:21.215 --> 00:28:23.837]  I'm going to finish up this special state of the world report.
[00:28:23.837 --> 00:28:28.860]  Then I'll hand the baton to David Knight, hosted from the Infowars News Center in Austin, Texas.
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:29.541]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:28:31.346 --> 00:28:32.928]  And of course, this is David Knight here live.
[00:28:32.928 --> 00:28:37.673]  We're going to continue with Alex's breakdown of global ruin is coming unless we stop it.
[00:28:37.673 --> 00:28:47.624]  After Alex's report, we're going to go back and look at more detail and more updates about Justice Scalia's death and what it means as we look at climate change and many other important issues.
[00:28:47.624 --> 00:28:48.305]  Stay with us.
[00:28:48.305 --> 00:28:48.846]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:57.574 --> 00:28:58.394]  Hey, everyone!
[00:28:58.394 --> 00:29:04.516]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:29:04.516 --> 00:29:06.597]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:29:06.597 --> 00:29:16.881]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:29:16.881 --> 00:29:22.863]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:29:23.323 --> 00:29:38.160]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:38.680]  I think so.
[00:29:58.348 --> 00:30:01.849]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:30:01.849 --> 00:30:10.090]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:15.512]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:30:15.512 --> 00:30:18.032]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:30:18.032 --> 00:30:20.153]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:30:34.993 --> 00:30:39.795]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[00:30:39.795 --> 00:30:46.877]  This new 4-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.

[00:30:58.041 --> 00:31:01.243]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[00:31:01.243 --> 00:31:03.585]  Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:31:03.585 --> 00:31:10.609]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[00:31:10.609 --> 00:31:15.933]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[00:31:15.933 --> 00:31:24.879]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[00:31:25.339 --> 00:31:34.227]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[00:31:34.227 --> 00:31:41.313]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spite G-Rex herbal processing technique.
[00:31:41.313 --> 00:31:46.658]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best

[00:32:54.279 --> 00:32:56.461]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.374 --> 00:33:20.196]  We are on the march.
[00:33:20.196 --> 00:33:23.338]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:33:23.338 --> 00:33:33.747]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:33.747 --> 00:33:34.928]  And we are back, my friends.
[00:33:34.928 --> 00:33:36.309]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:33:36.309 --> 00:33:43.495]  Before I hand the baton to David Knight here in the Infowars News Center, I want to finish up just putting out this warning.
[00:33:43.495 --> 00:33:44.136]  And you can take it,
[00:33:45.276 --> 00:33:51.979]  And you can investigate what I'm saying and find out it's true, and that it's far worse than what I'm even saying, or you can just make a joke out of it and move on.
[00:33:51.979 --> 00:34:06.844]  But we've reached that critical mass point where world government's being announced, global taxes are being announced, banning of cash is being announced, open announcement that families are bad, that free speech is bad, that saying mother or father is bad, founding fathers are bad.
[00:34:06.844 --> 00:34:11.066]  And it's not just weirdo leftist professors and deans.
[00:34:11.066 --> 00:34:12.706]  It's state houses.
[00:34:12.706 --> 00:34:13.687]  It's the federal government.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:24.035]  This is a totalitarian takeover that is beyond anything we ever saw in the Soviet Union in its width and breadth.
[00:34:25.405 --> 00:34:31.567]  And why I'm so concerned is we've seen the urban warfare drills for domestic takeover, the training manuals are public.
[00:34:31.567 --> 00:34:39.109]  We've seen the admitted development of civilian inmate labor camps and internment facilities in America at army.mil.
[00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:45.491]  And we've seen the mainstream media go, Alex Jones hates our troops, and says they want to put you in a camp.
[00:34:45.491 --> 00:34:52.893]  That was the same thing they'd say in the late 30s when Germans, generals and people, would come out and say, Hitler's bad, don't let him launch wars.
[00:34:52.893 --> 00:34:54.253]  And they'd go, why are you against our troops?
[00:34:55.452 --> 00:34:58.353]  No, they were for the troops and for the German people.
[00:34:58.353 --> 00:35:03.114]  Our troops are the ones that tell me about this before it was public.
[00:35:03.114 --> 00:35:05.095]  Okay, I'm going to leave it right there.
[00:35:05.095 --> 00:35:07.556]  Folks know our sources.
[00:35:07.556 --> 00:35:10.757]  Generals, colonels, special forces, you name it, many of them on record.
[00:35:10.757 --> 00:35:13.758]  Green Berets, Delta Force, you name it.
[00:35:13.758 --> 00:35:23.841]  They've got manuals that we published two years ago from Fort Hood where they said, do not talk about the founding fathers, they wouldn't be welcome in today's army.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.222]  People couldn't believe that document two years ago.
[00:35:27.222 --> 00:35:30.885]  Now San Diego is trying to pass a law to ban you.
[00:35:30.885 --> 00:35:32.606]  Of course that's the enemy!
[00:35:32.606 --> 00:35:34.608]  Of course that's a takeover!
[00:35:34.608 --> 00:35:36.950]  Of course it's crazy!
[00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:40.293]  I don't blame you for not believing me back when it was secret.
[00:35:40.293 --> 00:35:43.956]  But you should believe me now when it's admitted.
[00:35:43.956 --> 00:35:45.918]  And you should understand this isn't a game.
[00:35:45.918 --> 00:35:47.819]  Every day I get up and put my life on the line.
[00:35:47.819 --> 00:35:49.861]  And I'm not a hero.
[00:35:49.861 --> 00:35:53.304]  I'd be a coward not fighting this and letting my family be enslaved.
[00:35:54.724 --> 00:35:58.893]  Quite frankly, I fight them so hard out of deep fear that evil will win.
[00:35:58.893 --> 00:36:05.726]  Not fear for my own body or even my children, but fear that I'll stand down and let just ravenous tyranny take over.
[00:36:06.872 --> 00:36:09.433]  Don't you have that fire in your belly to say no?
[00:36:09.433 --> 00:36:15.016]  I know many of you do, and I salute you and thank you, but those on the fence are those that think, oh, we're a little extreme.
[00:36:15.016 --> 00:36:18.898]  Barry Goldwater said it best, extremism and defense of liberty is no vice.
[00:36:18.898 --> 00:36:20.479]  I'm not extreme enough.
[00:36:20.479 --> 00:36:21.799]  I'm not alarmist enough.
[00:36:21.799 --> 00:36:23.820]  I'm not hardcore enough.
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:33.665]  When we see the things going on in this country, they admit the former Attorney General runs the big Arthur Anderson style accounting firm that lets mega banks pay no taxes.
[00:36:35.131 --> 00:36:41.633]  They admit that the stock market's rigged, and the currencies are rigged, and the interest rates are rigged.
[00:36:41.633 --> 00:36:45.073]  Folks, remember they used to deny that.
[00:36:45.073 --> 00:36:47.874]  Now they admit that.
[00:36:47.874 --> 00:36:52.355]  The Pope called last year for world government and carbon taxes.
[00:36:52.355 --> 00:36:54.336]  It's here.
[00:36:54.336 --> 00:36:55.676]  And that's why I want to say the Liberty Movement.
[00:36:56.593 --> 00:37:01.574]  Don't feel ashamed when the media ridicules you and tries to make fun of you to make you shut up.
[00:37:01.574 --> 00:37:03.335]  Those manuals are public.
[00:37:03.335 --> 00:37:06.816]  That's using peer pressure because they're so scared of you to make you feel like you're alone.
[00:37:06.816 --> 00:37:07.936]  You're not alone.
[00:37:07.936 --> 00:37:13.417]  And you stand with history and you stand on the side of God against evil when you speak out.
[00:37:13.417 --> 00:37:20.039]  And one man who is morally right against a whole throng of people that support corruption is the majority.
[00:37:21.587 --> 00:37:22.647]  That's what it comes down to.
[00:37:22.647 --> 00:37:47.558]  So I want you to know how special you are today in your fight against this, because the armored vehicles being deployed, the billions of rounds of ammo, the training manuals saying a coming civil war with the patriots and gun owners and veterans and Christians is coming, and the founding fathers are bad, and mommy and daddy and father and mother and boy and girl is being banned nationwide, and contact sports they're trying to ban, and women in frontline combat.
[00:37:47.558 --> 00:37:49.999]  All of it is social engineering to wreck us.
[00:37:50.899 --> 00:37:57.093]  The goal is to wreck us because the globalists are exempt from their own system.
[00:37:57.093 --> 00:37:58.717]  Remember that.
[00:37:58.717 --> 00:38:00.682]  And remember that people like Hillary Clinton...
[00:38:01.505 --> 00:38:20.462]  With all of her corruption, or Brian Williams lying about being in combat, and persecuting people of the IRS, and Benghazi, and the cattle futures, and Whitewater, and Vince Foster, and the emails, and all of it, and the identity politics of people saying, she's a woman, so I'm going to support her.
[00:38:20.462 --> 00:38:27.428]  Well, a lot of Germans said, Adolf Hitler is Germanic-Austrian war hero, and we're going to support him.
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:31.480]  Think about that.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:44.025]  When she gets more money than anybody else from Wall Street, and then she says, Wall Street is to blame for what's happened to our economy, not the top of Wall Street, but all of it.
[00:38:44.025 --> 00:38:47.166]  And don't worry, she's going to redistribute that wealth for you.
[00:38:47.166 --> 00:38:53.228]  You add a new banker bailout to the globalists, that's how they redistribute wealth, and then you get nothing.
[00:38:53.228 --> 00:38:54.669]  Blacks get double unemployment.
[00:38:55.996 --> 00:38:59.960]  Under Obama, because he doesn't need your vote, because he's black!
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.022]  Well, women, you think you're going to get a better deal with Hillary?
[00:39:02.022 --> 00:39:04.125]  She doesn't need your vote, because she's a woman!
[00:39:05.492 --> 00:39:10.295]  That is the most sexist, racist, mindless, stupid way to vote.
[00:39:10.295 --> 00:39:11.616]  Or stupidest way to think.
[00:39:11.616 --> 00:39:17.439]  Going, I don't know, girl power, you know, I don't care what she stands for, girl power.
[00:39:17.439 --> 00:39:21.502]  You associate your power through somebody because they look like you.
[00:39:21.502 --> 00:39:23.083]  That isn't you.
[00:39:23.083 --> 00:39:27.646]  That is the most cult-like, whacked out, crazy stuff I've ever heard of.
[00:39:28.246 --> 00:39:29.728]  They're gearing up for total collapse.
[00:39:29.728 --> 00:39:30.889]  The Pentagon, everybody.
[00:39:30.889 --> 00:39:33.051]  I've been warning you about this for years.
[00:39:33.051 --> 00:39:35.654]  The collapse already started five, six years ago around the world.
[00:39:35.654 --> 00:39:36.996]  Now it's coming here.
[00:39:36.996 --> 00:39:44.043]  I saw Fox News this morning and they said, it's like there's an island and America's, you know, the highest up, but the water's rising on us too.
[00:39:44.904 --> 00:39:47.266]  We're the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[00:39:47.266 --> 00:39:48.827]  We're the tallest leprechaun.
[00:39:48.827 --> 00:39:50.588]  I heard all these quotes.
[00:39:50.588 --> 00:39:51.749]  We were right about that.
[00:39:51.749 --> 00:39:52.289]  We were right.
[00:39:52.289 --> 00:40:00.695]  The Pentagon came out this week with the NSA and said, yeah, the Internet of Things in your house, all the smart toasters and refrigerators, and we're watching and listening to you.
[00:40:00.695 --> 00:40:01.696]  You bet.
[00:40:01.696 --> 00:40:03.657]  Oh, I told you that 15 years ago.
[00:40:03.657 --> 00:40:06.859]  Because it was in MIT documents.
[00:40:06.859 --> 00:40:09.161]  I'm telling you the truth.
[00:40:09.161 --> 00:40:10.682]  I'm warning you.
[00:40:10.682 --> 00:40:11.823]  And then some say, so what?
[00:40:11.823 --> 00:40:12.864]  World government's the next level.
[00:40:13.871 --> 00:40:15.512]  That's how Star Trek is.
[00:40:15.512 --> 00:40:19.094]  You know, a world federation of lovey people all working together.
[00:40:19.094 --> 00:40:21.455]  It's all happy, it's pro-human.
[00:40:21.455 --> 00:40:24.936]  The New World Order isn't pro-human.
[00:40:24.936 --> 00:40:38.103]  It's like Ted Bundy, the famous serial killer, in a little non-threatening suit, getting people to come up and be his friend, in a little non-threatening Volkswagen and getting women in the car.
[00:40:39.167 --> 00:40:42.368]  I know Bernie Sanders and the rest of them look sweet and cute.
[00:40:42.368 --> 00:40:45.429]  Folks, don't get in the yellow Volkswagen, please.
[00:40:45.429 --> 00:40:48.591]  I'm going to hand the baton to David Knight right now, but I want to say something here.
[00:40:48.591 --> 00:40:51.292]  I'm not going to spend a lot of time on air-plugging products.
[00:40:51.292 --> 00:40:54.453]  A lot of times I even skip breaks, and it hurts the network and others.
[00:40:54.453 --> 00:40:56.434]  We have trouble funding sometimes because of it.
[00:40:56.434 --> 00:41:02.316]  But listen, we bring you the best products there are at the lowest prices, and it funds the tip of the spear in the info war.
[00:41:02.316 --> 00:41:04.417]  So I want to thank all of you that do support us.
[00:41:05.277 --> 00:41:13.881]  We support you, but if you're not buying the products and the t-shirts and the books and the films and the best material out there at InfoWarsStore.com, you're crazy.
[00:41:13.881 --> 00:41:17.583]  If you're not supporting us at InfoWarsLife.com, what is the point?
[00:41:18.359 --> 00:41:19.499]  We're all about free will.
[00:41:19.499 --> 00:41:23.080]  Revolutionaries previously robbed banks and kidnapped people for money.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.501]  We fund it with high-quality products.
[00:41:25.501 --> 00:41:32.662]  And the revolution begins with voting with your dollars and supporting outlets that support freedom and withdrawing your support from the globalist.
[00:41:32.662 --> 00:41:34.803]  Infowarslife.com for the nutraceuticals.
[00:41:34.803 --> 00:41:36.443]  Big specials in tonight.
[00:41:36.443 --> 00:41:37.904]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:41:37.904 --> 00:41:41.265]  Infowarsstore.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:41.265 --> 00:41:47.046]  If you want to find the water filters, the non-GMO seeds, the Hillary for prison t-shirts, a new limited edition and more.
[00:41:47.426 --> 00:41:48.826]  And that's how we fund this operation.
[00:41:48.826 --> 00:41:54.288]  That's why I'm up here today, fighting on the weekend, because my family has no future if we don't say no.
[00:41:54.288 --> 00:41:57.988]  And I know the power that individuals have who promote liberty throughout history.
[00:41:57.988 --> 00:42:01.789]  And all we've got to do is stand up and say no, and this tyranny will dissipate.
[00:42:01.789 --> 00:42:06.430]  But if we lay down, look at how bad it's already gotten, it's going to get ten times worse.
[00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:08.571]  We now go back to the Infowars News Center in David Knight.
[00:42:09.315 --> 00:42:13.098]  And again, that's Alex Jones on Global Ruin is coming, unless we stop it.
[00:42:13.098 --> 00:42:18.262]  When we come back from the break, we're going to talk about the implications of Scalia's death.
[00:42:18.262 --> 00:42:20.424]  Will Obama appoint a replacement?
[00:42:20.424 --> 00:42:21.665]  Will the GOP stop it?
[00:42:21.665 --> 00:42:26.929]  They've said they would, but they said they wouldn't fund the climate treaty, and of course that's a key part.
[00:42:27.569 --> 00:42:37.798]  of what's important about the death of Antonin Scalia, and that is what's going to happen with Obama's efforts to shut down coal to control our country's energy supply from Washington.
[00:42:37.798 --> 00:42:41.361]  We're also going to take a look at the GOP South Carolina debate.
[00:42:41.361 --> 00:42:43.743]  Very entertaining, very insightful.
[00:42:43.743 --> 00:42:44.623]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:02.185]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male, and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[00:43:02.185 --> 00:43:06.929]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:43:06.929 --> 00:43:08.271]  Talk about the effects.
[00:43:08.271 --> 00:43:09.772]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:43:09.772 --> 00:43:11.714]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:43:11.714 --> 00:43:12.835]  I feel like I look better.
[00:43:12.835 --> 00:43:13.536]  I feel better.
[00:43:13.536 --> 00:43:14.938]  I feel sexier.
[00:43:14.938 --> 00:43:15.298]  I love it.
[00:43:15.558 --> 00:43:18.519]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.

[00:45:28.301 --> 00:45:33.342]  Super Mel Vitality from InfoWarsLife.com has sold out multiple times in the last three months.
[00:45:33.482 --> 00:45:34.022]  We're good to go.
[00:45:59.173 --> 00:46:02.956]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:46:02.956 --> 00:46:10.681]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:46:10.681 --> 00:46:19.286]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:46:19.286 --> 00:46:23.729]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:46:23.729 --> 00:46:29.053]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:46:29.133 --> 00:46:30.133]  We're good to go.

[00:48:21.897 --> 00:48:30.482]  quality, and the packaging is first quality as well, even with Ziploc ties that allow you to utilize it to the utmost, even after you've opened it.

[00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:49.235]  So we have several sales right now that you can find at InfoWarsLife.com as well as InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:48:49.235 --> 00:48:53.499]  Now I want to get back to what we were talking about at the very beginning of the broadcast.
[00:48:53.499 --> 00:48:55.801]  Many of you don't get the first five minutes.
[00:48:55.801 --> 00:48:57.342]  Sometimes it's local news.
[00:48:57.342 --> 00:48:59.524]  I want to go back and put some of this in context.
[00:48:59.524 --> 00:49:01.986]  We want to put the death of Scalia
[00:49:02.546 --> 00:49:02.646]  Yes.
[00:49:18.542 --> 00:49:18.802]  I think?
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.881]  We're not going to appoint somebody in this session.
[00:49:44.881 --> 00:49:46.742]  We've got a presidential election that we're in the middle of.
[00:49:46.742 --> 00:49:49.023]  We're going to wait and see what the people say.
[00:49:49.023 --> 00:49:54.805]  We're going to let the next president appoint the replacement for Justice Scalia.
[00:49:54.805 --> 00:49:57.586]  The Democrats are very furious about that.
[00:49:57.586 --> 00:49:59.227]  Obama says he's going to introduce somebody.
[00:49:59.227 --> 00:50:04.208]  So it remains to be seen whether or not the GOP is going to have the backbone to stand up and do something about that.
[00:50:04.208 --> 00:50:07.910]  Remember that when they came through with the Paris Climate Accord,
[00:50:09.076 --> 00:50:12.241]  We heard all kinds of tough talk from the GOP Senate.
[00:50:12.241 --> 00:50:14.544]  They said, well, we're going to have something to say about that.
[00:50:15.396 --> 00:50:19.058]  It was only three days later that they did have something to say about it.
[00:50:19.058 --> 00:50:21.039]  They totally caved.
[00:50:21.039 --> 00:50:26.021]  Remember that they completely funded it as part of the omnibus bill that they ran through.
[00:50:26.021 --> 00:50:28.802]  So, that lasted for all of three days.
[00:50:28.802 --> 00:50:33.684]  Will they be able to hold off until after the election for this appointment?
[00:50:33.684 --> 00:50:35.645]  What does it mean if they don't hold off?
[00:50:35.645 --> 00:50:39.447]  But first, I want to take a look at some of the breaking news about his death.
[00:50:40.455 --> 00:50:45.537]  We have an article on Infowars.com which also references the Washington Post.
[00:50:45.537 --> 00:50:48.659]  Texas judge turns down a scolia autopsy.
[00:50:48.659 --> 00:50:52.701]  Now also the family was also not interested in doing that.
[00:50:52.701 --> 00:50:54.242]  But this was a local judge.
[00:50:54.242 --> 00:50:57.123]  Remember this is in a very, very remote part of Texas.
[00:50:57.123 --> 00:50:58.504]  I was just there last week.
[00:50:59.364 --> 00:51:04.665]  And when you go down to the Big Bend Park, you are hours and hours away from anything.
[00:51:04.665 --> 00:51:07.806]  It's about as remote as anything you're going to find in the United States.
[00:51:07.806 --> 00:51:17.407]  There's no cell phone service, there's no data service, not even in the hotels where we were saying, could we get any kind of data or telephone service.
[00:51:17.407 --> 00:51:23.968]  So this is a Presidio County Judge, Cinderella Guevara, that's actually her name, Cinderella Guevara.
[00:51:23.968 --> 00:51:26.689]  She called up and she says, well, were there any signs of foul play?
[00:51:26.689 --> 00:51:27.389]  And they said, no.
[00:51:28.149 --> 00:51:41.117]  So she said she called Scalia's doctor who informed her that Scalia had visited him for a shoulder injury last week but he also suffered from several chronic ailments and so then she just said well we're not going to do a
[00:51:42.669 --> 00:51:43.549]  An autopsy?
[00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:45.970]  I'm not even going to look at the body.
[00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:47.130]  How about that?
[00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:54.912]  So the judge, who did not see the body, indicated on his death certificate that it would be from a heart attack.
[00:51:54.912 --> 00:51:57.953]  Let me read you from the Washington Post how they phrase this.
[00:51:57.953 --> 00:52:03.654]  They say, of course, he died, yet the details of his sudden death trickled in on Sunday.
[00:52:03.654 --> 00:52:07.595]  As they did, it appeared that the hours afterward were anything but orderly.
[00:52:08.055 --> 00:52:10.837]  They say he was found dead in his room at a hunting resort by a ranch owner.
[00:52:10.837 --> 00:52:16.802]  It then took hours for the authorities in remote West Texas to find a Justice of the Peace official, said Sunday.
[00:52:16.802 --> 00:52:25.610]  When they did, she pronounced him dead of natural causes without seeing the body and decided not to order an autopsy.
[00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:31.555]  A second Justice of the Peace, who was called but couldn't get to his body in time, said she would have ordered an autopsy.
[00:52:31.555 --> 00:52:32.836]  That's from the Washington Post.
[00:52:33.541 --> 00:52:34.401]  Okay.
[00:52:34.401 --> 00:52:40.805]  Now, she goes on to say, if it had been me, I would want to know, said Juanita Bishop, a Justice of the Peace in Presidio, Texas.
[00:52:40.805 --> 00:52:48.529]  As late as Sunday afternoon, there were conflicting reports about whether or not an autopsy would be performed, though officials later said Scalia's body was being embalmed.
[00:52:48.529 --> 00:52:49.930]  There would be no autopsy.
[00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:56.373]  One report by WFAA-TV in Dallas said the death certificate would show death by heart attack.
[00:52:56.373 --> 00:52:57.194]  So I guess that's it.
[00:52:57.807 --> 00:53:02.739]  You know, we saw the liberal press come out and say, oh, Scalia died.
[00:53:02.739 --> 00:53:06.729]  Three, two, one, conspiracy theories.
[00:53:06.729 --> 00:53:06.869]  Now.
[00:53:07.881 --> 00:53:12.563]  Let me play for you a conspiracy fact from 41 years ago.
[00:53:12.563 --> 00:53:14.904]  I played this at the beginning of the broadcast.
[00:53:14.904 --> 00:53:16.705]  As I said, many of you may not have heard it.
[00:53:16.705 --> 00:53:18.546]  I want to play a little bit more of this again.
[00:53:18.546 --> 00:53:20.446]  This is 41 years ago.
[00:53:20.446 --> 00:53:25.028]  The Frank Church Committee hearings about abuses by the CIA.
[00:53:25.028 --> 00:53:33.372]  Frank Church is talking to William Colby, who was then director of the CIA, and listen to what they're talking about in terms of heart attacks.
[00:53:34.247 --> 00:53:42.574]  So I had to find, one time they wanted me to find, um, to find out if there was such a thing as, um, as a poison that was undetectable.
[00:53:42.574 --> 00:53:47.198]  Especially one that seemed to, uh, mimic a heart attack.
[00:53:47.198 --> 00:53:50.941]  That would kill someone, but it would appear that they had a heart attack.
[00:53:50.941 --> 00:53:52.182]  I did find such a thing.
[00:53:52.182 --> 00:53:56.386]  Does this pistol, uh, fire the dart?
[00:53:56.386 --> 00:53:58.267]  Yes, it does, Mr. Chairman.
[00:53:58.267 --> 00:54:00.149]  And a special one was developed, which
[00:54:00.951 --> 00:54:05.982]  Potentially would be able to enter the target without perception.
[00:54:05.982 --> 00:54:10.793]  The poison was frozen into some sort of dart and then it was shot at.
[00:54:11.654 --> 00:54:23.877]  Uh, very high speed into the person so when it reached the person it would melt inside them and the only thing would be like one little tiny red dot on their body which is hard to detect.
[00:54:23.877 --> 00:54:27.358]  There wouldn't be a needle left or anything like that in the person.
[00:54:27.358 --> 00:54:31.319]  But also the toxin itself would not appear in the autopsy?
[00:54:31.319 --> 00:54:37.200]  Yes, so that there was no way of perceiving that the target was him.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.301]  Have you brought with you
[00:54:40.297 --> 00:54:49.148]  Some of those devices which would have enabled the CIA to use this poison for, we have indeed, for killing people.
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:54.883]  The round thing at the top is obviously the sight.
[00:54:54.883 --> 00:54:56.164]  It works by electricity.
[00:54:56.164 --> 00:55:00.948]  There's a battery in the handle and it fires a small dart.
[00:55:00.948 --> 00:55:03.410]  And again, what you're listening to, we'll go ahead and stop that now.
[00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:05.011]  We played that earlier in the broadcast.
[00:55:05.011 --> 00:55:08.214]  Many people were getting news broadcasts at the top of the hour.
[00:55:08.214 --> 00:55:09.275]  That was 41 years ago.
[00:55:09.275 --> 00:55:12.277]  And of course they're saying they could form a toxin.
[00:55:13.078 --> 00:55:16.320]  That would cause it to look like somebody had a natural heart attack.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:18.821]  They could freeze it into a dart.
[00:55:18.821 --> 00:55:21.023]  It would leave no trace for an autopsy.
[00:55:21.023 --> 00:55:22.664]  You would not be able to trace the toxin.
[00:55:22.664 --> 00:55:24.505]  That was 41 years ago.
[00:55:24.505 --> 00:55:29.448]  The CIA has had a lot of practice since then assassinating people.
[00:55:29.448 --> 00:55:31.349]  So has this administration.
[00:55:32.369 --> 00:55:49.265]  When Obama's got a disposition matrix with his drones, with other issues, when they are openly doing what they were embarrassed and ashamed of because of war criminal actions possibly that people might take against them, they used to be ashamed of the fact that they would assassinate people as a matter of policy.
[00:55:49.765 --> 00:55:52.768]  Now they openly talk about it.
[00:55:52.768 --> 00:55:55.830]  We have seen the Supreme Court Justice Roberts.
[00:55:55.830 --> 00:56:03.456]  Many of us believe that he was being blackmailed when he wrote both the dissenting and the concurring opinion on Obamacare at the same time.
[00:56:03.456 --> 00:56:05.038]  That was pretty much unprecedented.
[00:56:05.618 --> 00:56:10.160]  That he would say it was both legal to do it, both also not legal to do it.
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:13.281]  He did both of those, and then ultimately sided with Obamacare.
[00:56:13.281 --> 00:56:16.322]  So many of us said, it looks like he was being blackmailed.
[00:56:16.322 --> 00:56:29.707]  And then we subsequently learned that Justice Roberts, as well as other Supreme Court justices like Ginsburg, were named by people as those that the NSA were intercepting their email, looking in detail at what they were saying.
[00:56:30.327 --> 00:56:35.509]  And I would say to those on the left who say, well, okay, Scalia was 79 years old.
[00:56:35.509 --> 00:56:38.410]  79-year-old people are going to die of heart attacks all the time.
[00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:48.553]  And yet, think about the fact that the guy that you're so excited about, Bernie Sanders, will be 75 when he becomes president, if he wins.
[00:56:48.553 --> 00:56:52.874]  He will be the same age as Justice Scalia at the end of the first term.
[00:56:52.874 --> 00:56:54.335]  You don't have a problem with that.
[00:56:54.335 --> 00:56:56.075]  You think, well, he's vital.
[00:56:56.075 --> 00:56:57.676]  If he were to die suddenly,
[00:56:58.416 --> 00:57:02.118]  Would you think that perhaps the Clinton gang had something to do with it?
[00:57:02.118 --> 00:57:12.862]  Why is it that when we have a government that increasingly acts like a banana republic, although with first world weapons, when they openly assassinate people, why would you say
[00:57:13.502 --> 00:57:25.886]  That we shouldn't question the death of someone as it is timed with the global takeover of our government using climate change, using the Trans-Pacific Partnership and other issues.
[00:57:25.886 --> 00:57:33.429]  The climate treaties are going to be a more direct path towards global governance than even the TPP and the TTIP.
[00:57:33.429 --> 00:57:34.769]  Stay with us when we come back.
[00:57:34.769 --> 00:57:39.171]  We're going to look at reactions and what may happen in the aftermath of Scalia's death.
[00:57:47.685 --> 00:57:48.806]  Brain Force is here.
[00:57:48.806 --> 00:57:51.008]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:57:51.008 --> 00:57:55.991]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:57:55.991 --> 00:57:59.274]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:57:59.274 --> 00:58:02.757]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:58:02.757 --> 00:58:04.518]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:58:04.738 --> 00:58:05.678]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:58:05.678 --> 00:58:06.839]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:58:06.839 --> 00:58:08.839]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[00:59:44.161 --> 00:59:45.623]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:01.354 --> 01:00:07.983]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:07.983 --> 01:00:10.966]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:13.857 --> 01:00:15.238]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.238 --> 01:00:17.420]  I'm David Knight, your host this hour.
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:21.404]  We're going to talk now about what the death of Antonin Scalia means.
[01:00:21.404 --> 01:00:27.389]  And of course, later in the hour, we're going to talk about the debate last night in South Carolina with GOP candidates.
[01:00:27.389 --> 01:00:30.331]  A lot of very interesting things happened in that debate.
[01:00:30.331 --> 01:00:34.254]  But first, I want to talk about what's going to happen with Antonin Scalia.
[01:00:34.935 --> 01:00:44.883]  We have Barack Obama saying he's going to nominate Scalia's successor in due time, and it looks like we're going to be at loggerheads between the GOP.
[01:00:44.883 --> 01:00:51.589]  Mitch McConnell says no, we're going to let the next president nominate the replacement for Scalia.
[01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:53.690]  Democrats are saying they're not going to have any of it.
[01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:55.332]  Let's listen to what Obama had to say.
[01:00:58.450 --> 01:01:06.337]  Justice Antonin Nino Scalia was a larger-than-life president on the bench.
[01:01:06.337 --> 01:01:12.562]  A brilliant legal mind with an energetic style, incisive wit, and colorful opinions.
[01:01:13.908 --> 01:01:21.892]  He influenced a generation of judges, lawyers, and students, and profoundly shaped the legal landscape.
[01:01:21.892 --> 01:01:28.335]  He will no doubt be remembered as one of the most consequential judges and thinkers to serve on the Supreme Court.
[01:01:28.335 --> 01:01:36.878]  And tonight, we join his fellow justices in mourning this remarkable man.
[01:01:36.878 --> 01:01:42.061]  Obviously, today is a time to remember Justice Scalia's legacy.
[01:01:44.625 --> 01:01:52.049]  I plan to fulfill my constitutional responsibilities to nominate a successor in due time.
[01:01:52.049 --> 01:02:01.575]  There will be plenty of time for me to do so and for the Senate to fulfill its responsibility to give that person a fair hearing and a timely vote.
[01:02:01.575 --> 01:02:05.477]  These are responsibilities that I take seriously, as should everyone.
[01:02:05.477 --> 01:02:07.779]  They're bigger than any one party.
[01:02:07.779 --> 01:02:09.380]  They are about our democracy.
[01:02:10.322 --> 01:02:20.796]  They're about the institution to which Justice Scalia dedicated his professional life and making sure it continues to function as the beacon of justice that our founders envisioned.
[01:02:21.898 --> 01:02:27.162]  Okay, let's hold it right there, because one of the big issues that's coming up, of course, is climate change.
[01:02:27.162 --> 01:02:34.448]  And we just had the Supreme Court put a stay on the orders by the EPA to enforce Obama's promise.
[01:02:34.448 --> 01:02:40.913]  Remember, that was a promise before he got elected the very first time, that he was going to bankrupt the coal industry.
[01:02:40.913 --> 01:02:42.274]  They put a stay on that order.
[01:02:42.274 --> 01:02:43.895]  That's going to be in play now.
[01:02:43.895 --> 01:02:46.798]  And when we talk about replacements for the Supreme Court, remember,
[01:02:47.478 --> 01:02:54.621]  Democrat appointees have always been reliable for the socialist, partisan, liberal side.
[01:02:54.621 --> 01:03:00.243]  We have a very spotty record on the Republican side, just like we do on other issues.
[01:03:00.243 --> 01:03:02.884]  They say they're going to do one thing and they do something completely different.
[01:03:02.884 --> 01:03:05.125]  If you look at what's going on with the Supreme Court right now,
[01:03:05.805 --> 01:03:14.593]  You have four Supreme Court justices, two by Clinton, two by Obama, that always vote for big government.
[01:03:14.593 --> 01:03:22.280]  Then you have four that always voted for small government, for more of a conservative point of view.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:25.222]  And you have one swing vote, which was Kennedy.
[01:03:25.222 --> 01:03:27.104]  And he was not reliable in terms of that.
[01:03:27.104 --> 01:03:29.406]  But let's take a look at some of the appointments that have been made.
[01:03:30.487 --> 01:03:37.252]  Reagan appointed Scalia, but he also appointed Sandra Day O'Connor, who was always reliably liberal.
[01:03:37.252 --> 01:03:41.554]  He also appointed Anthony Kennedy, who is essentially the swing vote.
[01:03:41.554 --> 01:03:43.936]  You can't understand which way he's going to go.
[01:03:43.936 --> 01:03:51.841]  And one of the reasons for that is because Anthony Kennedy interprets the Constitution according to international law.
[01:03:51.841 --> 01:03:56.344]  See, that was the key difference with Scalia and the rest of these judges.
[01:03:56.344 --> 01:04:00.207]  Scalia doesn't believe, or did not believe, in a living Constitution.
[01:04:00.747 --> 01:04:04.609]  He believed in a literal, written constitution.
[01:04:04.609 --> 01:04:15.254]  If you don't go with what's written, if you don't say we're going to go with the originalist terms, we're going to look at what was meant by militia, we're going to look at what was meant by natural-born citizen, etc., etc.
[01:04:15.254 --> 01:04:18.796]  We're going to go with the literal reading of the text.
[01:04:18.796 --> 01:04:24.538]  If you don't do that, then basically you have divorced yourself from legal guidelines.
[01:04:24.538 --> 01:04:25.159]  When you do that,
[01:04:25.905 --> 01:04:30.689]  The law is whatever the justices say, whatever the president says.
[01:04:30.689 --> 01:04:35.252]  So you then have something that is literally a dictatorship.
[01:04:35.252 --> 01:04:39.155]  The law comes out of their mouth, not off of the written paper.
[01:04:39.155 --> 01:04:42.177]  That was why Scalia's approach was so important.
[01:04:42.177 --> 01:04:46.741]  That's why it is so dangerous to have the kind of approach that we have from Kennedy and others.
[01:04:46.741 --> 01:04:48.022]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:04:58.655 --> 01:05:02.176]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:05:02.176 --> 01:05:10.419]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:05:10.419 --> 01:05:15.840]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:18.361]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:05:18.361 --> 01:05:20.462]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[01:05:31.271 --> 01:05:35.333]  The brand new ProPure ProMax High Performance Shower Filter.

[01:06:06.387 --> 01:06:21.499]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[01:06:21.499 --> 01:06:24.121]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:28.018 --> 01:06:29.359]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:29.359 --> 01:06:33.822]  I'm David Knight, your host on this February the 14th, 2016.
[01:06:33.822 --> 01:06:36.143]  We've been talking about the death of Antonin Scalia.
[01:06:36.143 --> 01:06:39.165]  We've been talking about global ruin being upon us.
[01:06:39.165 --> 01:06:41.607]  We had a special report from Alex Jones.
[01:06:41.607 --> 01:06:46.050]  And we're going to talk now about the GOP debate last night in South Carolina.
[01:06:46.050 --> 01:06:49.592]  Before we do, though, I want to just finish up on Justice Scalia.
[01:06:49.592 --> 01:06:51.153]  As I was pointing out in the last segment,
[01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:59.602]  Democrat appointees to the Supreme Court have been very reliable for the Democrats, just as they pretty much fulfill their promises to their constituents.
[01:06:59.602 --> 01:07:00.784]  It's on the GOP side.
[01:07:01.530 --> 01:07:03.631]  That they will say one thing and do another.
[01:07:03.631 --> 01:07:13.679]  For example, when we look at Reagan, as I point out, he appointed Justice Scalia, but then he also appointed Sandra Day O'Connor, who typically voted against everything that Ronald Reagan stood for.
[01:07:13.679 --> 01:07:18.122]  It was important for him to put a woman on the Supreme Court.
[01:07:18.122 --> 01:07:23.666]  It was more important for Reagan to put a woman on the Supreme Court than it was to get somebody who agreed with him ideologically.
[01:07:24.332 --> 01:07:26.113]  That's the sad truth.
[01:07:26.113 --> 01:07:27.254]  Understand that.
[01:07:27.254 --> 01:07:35.459]  Understand, just as we saw him compromise on the Supreme Court, we also saw Reagan compromise on the Second Amendment when his friend got shot.
[01:07:35.459 --> 01:07:39.221]  As a favor to Sarah Brady, he threw gun owners under the bus.
[01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:41.583]  That's the reality of Ronald Reagan.
[01:07:41.583 --> 01:07:45.165]  I am not as big a fan of Ronald Reagan as the Republicans are.
[01:07:45.165 --> 01:07:49.207]  Of course, we'll hear they invoke him over and over again in the debate last night.
[01:07:50.228 --> 01:07:54.490]  The other Supreme Court Justice that Ronald Reagan appointed, who is still with us, is Anthony Kennedy.
[01:07:54.490 --> 01:08:02.074]  And as I pointed out, this is Jeffrey Toobin and others have said that he uses international law to interpret the Constitution.
[01:08:02.074 --> 01:08:05.536]  He is a leading proponent of that, Anthony Kennedy is.
[01:08:05.536 --> 01:08:08.818]  And so that's why he seems to be all over the map for people.
[01:08:08.818 --> 01:08:13.280]  Because, quite frankly, he doesn't really care about the Constitution.
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.902]  International law is more important for Anthony Kennedy.
[01:08:15.902 --> 01:08:18.323]  That's the guy that was appointed by Ronald Reagan.
[01:08:19.087 --> 01:08:20.468]  Then we look at Richard Nixon.
[01:08:20.468 --> 01:08:26.012]  He appointed Harry Blackmun, who wrote Roe v. Wade, as well as Lewis Powell, who voted for Roe v. Wade.
[01:08:26.012 --> 01:08:30.015]  We look at George I. He appointed David Souter, a very liberal judge.
[01:08:30.015 --> 01:08:39.423]  He also appointed Clarence Thomas, who has, I think, voted, as I would agree with, as an originalist, as Scalia votes.
[01:08:39.423 --> 01:08:47.149]  I remember when there were confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas, and I remember the person who opposed him the most was now Vice President Joe Biden.
[01:08:48.203 --> 01:08:50.084]  And I can recall exactly where we were.
[01:08:50.084 --> 01:08:51.304]  My wife and I were on vacation.
[01:08:51.304 --> 01:09:08.190]  We were traveling up the Appalachian Highway, and Joe Biden was dressing down Clarence Thomas because he had talked about natural law and our rights coming from God, not being privileges granted by government.
[01:09:09.218 --> 01:09:12.960]  I can remember I got so mad when I listened to this exchange.
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:20.484]  I drove a little bit faster than usual, especially because Clarence Thomas would not defend the Declaration of Independence.
[01:09:20.484 --> 01:09:25.807]  That's basically what the Declaration of Independence says, that our rights come from God, not from government.
[01:09:25.807 --> 01:09:29.189]  We create the government to protect those rights.
[01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:36.794]  When the government destroys those rights, we have a duty and a right to alter or abolish that government.
[01:09:37.634 --> 01:09:38.835]  Joe Biden doesn't think so.
[01:09:38.835 --> 01:09:42.417]  Joe Biden believes in privileges that are granted by government.
[01:09:42.417 --> 01:09:50.622]  So we got a mixed bag from George I. George II, W, appointed Roberts, who shepherded in Obamacare under suspicious circumstances.
[01:09:50.622 --> 01:09:52.804]  I pointed out he's done that twice.
[01:09:52.804 --> 01:09:59.868]  And the first time he wrote both opinions, both for and against, and then voted for Obamacare.
[01:09:59.868 --> 01:10:03.590]  So we've had a very mixed bag of justices from the GOP.
[01:10:04.551 --> 01:10:11.235]  But of course, if we see something coming from the Democrat side, you can bet that they are going to be reliably statist.
[01:10:11.235 --> 01:10:15.917]  Now, what is up before the Supreme Court that is important?
[01:10:15.917 --> 01:10:21.440]  Politico points out that Scalia's death could change the court on abortion, on race issues, and on climate.
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:23.661]  Climate is the key thing.
[01:10:23.661 --> 01:10:25.542]  And climate was what happened last week.
[01:10:25.542 --> 01:10:30.204]  And as I pointed out before, this was something we never got around to talking about in detail last week.
[01:10:30.204 --> 01:10:30.945]  I mentioned it briefly.
[01:10:31.909 --> 01:10:37.015]  But the Supreme Court put a stay on the White House's carbon pollution limits.
[01:10:37.015 --> 01:10:43.562]  This was Obama's effort, using the EPA, to shut down the coal industry, as he promised when he was running for president.
[01:10:44.241 --> 01:11:00.034]  And they point out on NPR, they say the heart of the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan is now on hold after the Supreme Court granted a stay request that blocks the EPA from moving ahead with rules that would lower carbon emissions from the nation's power plants.
[01:11:00.034 --> 01:11:02.996]  The case is scheduled to be argued in June in the U.S.
[01:11:02.996 --> 01:11:07.560]  Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, a very liberal court.
[01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:20.729]  They say, but a decision could be a long time in coming, particularly if the case winds up in the Supreme Court, meaning the rule's fate might not be determined before a new presidential administration comes into power in 2017.
[01:11:20.729 --> 01:11:30.056]  Understand, however, that if we now have a 4-4 split in the Supreme Court, lower court's decisions will be upheld.
[01:11:30.056 --> 01:11:31.157]  Do you see how important that is?
[01:11:32.142 --> 01:11:32.882]  If the D.C.
[01:11:32.882 --> 01:11:36.403]  Supreme Court agrees with the liberal D.C.
[01:11:36.403 --> 01:11:39.544]  Supreme Court, or Court of Appeals, I should say.
[01:11:39.544 --> 01:11:41.644]  It's a district court, it's not a Supreme Court.
[01:11:41.644 --> 01:11:58.168]  If the District Court in the District of Columbia agrees with the Obama Administration, agrees with the Obama EPA on these rules, then basically the Supreme Court in a 4-4 split would not be able to stop it.
[01:11:58.168 --> 01:12:01.349]  They would still have to lift the stay, but who knows what they will do.
[01:12:02.179 --> 01:12:03.719]  They're not reliable.
[01:12:03.719 --> 01:12:05.500]  They don't have a backbone.
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:08.381]  We have seen them go wobbly over and over again.
[01:12:08.381 --> 01:12:22.224]  I mean, clearly when we look at the court, even the best of justices, even justices like Scalia that were appointed by Ronald Reagan, had no problem with the UN's war on drugs, had no problem with civil asset forfeiture.
[01:12:23.066 --> 01:12:26.969]  They've had no problem with the kind of torture that we see going on.
[01:12:26.969 --> 01:12:32.453]  When Scalia was questioned on torture, he said, well, the Constitution doesn't say anything about torture.
[01:12:32.453 --> 01:12:36.956]  And the person who was questioning him said, yeah, but it talks about cruel and unusual punishment.
[01:12:36.956 --> 01:12:38.917]  He goes, but that's not punishment.
[01:12:38.917 --> 01:12:39.478]  That's torture.
[01:12:40.768 --> 01:12:42.570]  I'm like, no, no.
[01:12:42.570 --> 01:12:44.992]  You have to give somebody their day in court.
[01:12:44.992 --> 01:12:50.256]  You have to give them due process before you enact a penalty, and that's the whole point.
[01:12:50.256 --> 01:13:03.687]  When we talk about waterboarding people, when we talk about waterboarding terrorists, okay, they're terrorists because we accused them of being terrorists, not because they were given due process and found to be a terrorist in a court of law.
[01:13:04.778 --> 01:13:22.014]  It's because we have these star chamber proceedings where all that has to happen is that the government accuses somebody of being a terrorist and then the media chimes in obediently and then we're allowed to torture them and we say that that's not punishment, that it's not cruel and unusual.
[01:13:22.014 --> 01:13:26.859]  So even Scalia was capable of twisting the law.
[01:13:28.246 --> 01:13:35.648]  Of ignoring the due process clauses and saying, well, okay, we're not punishing them because we haven't found them guilty of anything.
[01:13:35.648 --> 01:13:41.129]  It's like, yeah, well, you don't torture somebody when you haven't even given them a trial or charged them with something.
[01:13:41.129 --> 01:13:44.350]  But of course, they take people's property under civil asset forfeiture.
[01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:45.590]  They don't have a problem with that.
[01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:52.011]  So even the best of these guys really aren't up to snuff, okay?
[01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:52.851]  Look at the Patriot Act.
[01:13:52.851 --> 01:13:54.092]  Look at the war on drugs.
[01:13:54.092 --> 01:13:55.172]  Look at the war on terrorism.
[01:13:56.152 --> 01:14:04.060]  But they go on to point out, and this is NPR, last week before Scalia died, they said more than two dozen states went to court to challenge the EPA's action.
[01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:15.272]  And in a surprise decision, 5-4, which would now be 4-4, the Supreme Court agreed to block the measure at least until an appeals court can hear arguments in the case this summer.
[01:14:16.138 --> 01:14:28.638]  And speaking on NPR's Morning Edition, they said, Scott Horsley said, there's no question they were caught off guard by the decision, which could be seen as an ominous sign for the President's broader climate agenda.
[01:14:29.758 --> 01:14:33.640]  And understand how broad this climate agenda is.
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:40.224]  The climate agenda has the capability, whether or not the TPP goes through it, of course it will go through.
[01:14:40.224 --> 01:14:40.964]  They're well on the way.
[01:14:40.964 --> 01:14:41.584]  They've signed it.
[01:14:41.584 --> 01:14:46.927]  They haven't ratified it yet, but they have essentially gutted the ratification process.
[01:14:46.927 --> 01:14:50.589]  People like Ted Cruz voted to gut that ratification process.
[01:14:50.589 --> 01:14:54.031]  Marco Rubio did as well when they passed the Trade Promotion Authority.
[01:14:54.031 --> 01:14:54.812]  They said, we don't care.
[01:14:55.572 --> 01:14:58.873]  What the constitutional process for ratifying a treaty is.
[01:14:58.873 --> 01:15:02.714]  We don't want there to be a requirement of having 67 senators.
[01:15:02.714 --> 01:15:04.255]  We want a simple up and down vote.
[01:15:04.255 --> 01:15:10.177]  And oh by the way, to make you feel better about it, we'll throw in a simple up or down majority with the House as well.
[01:15:10.177 --> 01:15:12.698]  But we'll shut down all ability to make amendments.
[01:15:12.698 --> 01:15:16.539]  We will shut down any kind of debate for more than 20 hours.
[01:15:16.539 --> 01:15:17.980]  No filibusters.
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:18.760]  And oh by the way,
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:32.070]  The devil in the details is that it really doesn't matter what this agreement says, because the key thing that they're voting on is to establish an international commission that will manage, manage our trade.
[01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:33.351]  It is not free trade.
[01:15:33.351 --> 01:15:42.239]  So when we look at climate change, understand that they have the ability to do it much more quickly, to establish a global taxing regime.
[01:15:43.254 --> 01:15:45.558]  That is true global governance.
[01:15:45.558 --> 01:15:47.181]  That's what they want to see happen.
[01:15:47.181 --> 01:15:50.526]  That is what is so important for them to not allow to be blocked.
[01:15:50.526 --> 01:15:51.187]  Stay with us.
[01:15:51.187 --> 01:15:51.968]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:51.968 --> 01:15:55.715]  We're going to take a look at the South Carolina GOP debate last night.
[01:15:57.722 --> 01:16:00.923]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:02.352]  Rob Dew joins us.
[01:17:02.352 --> 01:17:05.474]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[01:17:05.474 --> 01:17:06.555]  Tell us what BrainForce did.
[01:17:06.555 --> 01:17:07.516]  I've been working all day.
[01:17:07.516 --> 01:17:10.018]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[01:17:10.018 --> 01:17:11.439]  I get in here at 830.
[01:17:11.439 --> 01:17:13.341]  I was kind of run down.
[01:17:13.341 --> 01:17:15.122]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[01:17:15.262 --> 01:17:17.143]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[01:17:17.143 --> 01:17:18.985]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[01:17:18.985 --> 01:17:20.025]  I popped two of them.
[01:17:20.025 --> 01:17:22.307]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[01:17:22.307 --> 01:17:24.088]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[01:17:24.088 --> 01:17:25.749]  It's got four and a half stars.
[01:17:25.749 --> 01:17:27.090]  People really love it.
[01:17:27.090 --> 01:17:27.691]  Read about it.

[01:17:36.977 --> 01:17:41.021]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[01:17:41.021 --> 01:17:47.167]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.

[01:20:39.813 --> 01:20:41.174]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:41.174 --> 01:20:45.297]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Sunday, February 14, 2016.
[01:20:45.297 --> 01:20:54.603]  Last night was the South Carolina GOP debate, taking place exactly one week before the GOP primary in South Carolina.
[01:20:54.603 --> 01:21:01.327]  It was very entertaining, very aggravating, quite frankly, because I don't like to see dirty tricks.
[01:21:01.327 --> 01:21:05.970]  And that entire process was a rigged process.
[01:21:05.970 --> 01:21:08.332]  You know, we talk about it being a reality TV show.
[01:21:09.658 --> 01:21:12.260]  Have we slumped into that when we look at these debates?
[01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:20.625]  Well, last night, it was really like a sitcom with a laugh track or boot track, and then it became more like a WWE wrestling match.
[01:21:20.625 --> 01:21:22.546]  You can see that right there.
[01:21:22.546 --> 01:21:29.130]  And Donald Trump gave Jeb Bush a drubbing and a noogie on top of it.
[01:21:29.130 --> 01:21:30.991]  We're going to talk about that in just a moment.
[01:21:31.491 --> 01:21:35.972]  Before we do, real quickly, we've got a couple of specials that were extended through the weekend that are going to be ending today.
[01:21:35.972 --> 01:21:38.473]  We've got Silver Bullet, 15% off.

[01:21:45.215 --> 01:21:52.478]  We also have an introductory special on AnthroPlex, our new twice-daily pill formulation that works synergistically with Supermail Vitality.
[01:21:52.478 --> 01:21:56.819]  If you get those two products together, you can get them at 15% off, plus free shipping.
[01:21:57.239 --> 01:22:01.000]  And again, you can get 10% off in addition with AutoShip.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:07.782]  These sales are going to end tonight and a huge sale on InfoWars Select Foods.
[01:22:07.782 --> 01:22:10.983]  30 to 40% off InfoWars Select Storable Foods.
[01:22:10.983 --> 01:22:13.224]  They store for up to 25 years.
[01:22:13.224 --> 01:22:14.024]  All made in America.
[01:22:14.284 --> 01:22:17.967]  From the food to the packaging, very high quality food.
[01:22:17.967 --> 01:22:25.192]  And again, you can get that, even that, even that heavy product, you can get for free shipping if your order is $50 or more.
[01:22:25.192 --> 01:22:29.175]  So we've got a lot of sales that we've extended through this weekend.
[01:22:29.175 --> 01:22:34.139]  The Silver Bullet, the Anthroplex introductory sale, those will be ending tonight for sure.
[01:22:35.327 --> 01:22:37.808]  Okay, let's take a look at this debate last night.
[01:22:37.808 --> 01:22:39.029]  You know, and the past.
[01:22:39.029 --> 01:22:44.431]  And I would characterize this debate as nothing but a televised push-pull.
[01:22:44.431 --> 01:22:46.112]  You know what a push-pull is?
[01:22:46.112 --> 01:22:47.473]  That's the sort of dirty trick
[01:22:48.564 --> 01:22:55.789]  Where they call people the day of the election and they put out some nasty, untrue rumor about somebody.
[01:22:55.789 --> 01:23:05.716]  You know, like calling people up in South Carolina and saying, uh, how would you, would it change your vote if you learned that John McCain had an illegitimate black child in South Carolina?
[01:23:05.716 --> 01:23:07.977]  And of course they did something like that, right?
[01:23:07.977 --> 01:23:08.457]  They did that.
[01:23:08.457 --> 01:23:09.618]  That's what they do with a push poll.
[01:23:09.618 --> 01:23:16.102]  They put out some negative, false information at the very last minute, doing it under the guise of an opinion poll.
[01:23:17.023 --> 01:23:19.686]  That's what that debate last night was.
[01:23:19.686 --> 01:23:21.588]  It was a giant push-pull.
[01:23:21.588 --> 01:23:23.330]  Understand how they rigged the audience.
[01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:25.152]  And of course, we could see this coming.
[01:23:25.152 --> 01:23:30.097]  Matt Drudge had some articles up about how the tickets were being distributed.
[01:23:30.097 --> 01:23:35.723]  The night before, there was a rock star rally at my former alma mater, USF in Tampa.
[01:23:36.323 --> 01:23:39.387]  And the basketball stadium, they had 17,000 people.
[01:23:39.387 --> 01:23:41.029]  It only seats 11,000 people.
[01:23:41.029 --> 01:23:44.974]  They put another 6,000 people on the floor, standing room only.
[01:23:44.974 --> 01:23:47.878]  It was a rock star appearance for Donald Trump.
[01:23:47.878 --> 01:23:50.141]  An audience eight times bigger.
[01:23:51.018 --> 01:23:54.640]  than this hand-picked audience in South Carolina.
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:56.642]  And of course, what did you see last night?
[01:23:56.642 --> 01:24:01.245]  You saw this audience booing virtually every time Donald Trump talked.
[01:24:01.245 --> 01:24:15.234]  Now, a lot of people say, well, look, they handed out the tickets to the GOP establishment, people who were part of the RNC, people who were part of the South Carolina GOP establishment, people who worked hard for this, they get the tickets, people who are donors, they get tickets.
[01:24:16.013 --> 01:24:17.054]  Okay, fine.
[01:24:17.054 --> 01:24:18.175]  You want to do that?
[01:24:18.175 --> 01:24:21.478]  Then tell the audience to shut up.
[01:24:21.478 --> 01:24:21.918]  Shut up.
[01:24:21.918 --> 01:24:24.060]  We don't need to know what your opinion is.
[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:32.947]  When you stack the audience with your supporters, and then you let them run wild as CBS did, to me, that is a dirty trick.
[01:24:32.947 --> 01:24:34.528]  That is a dirty trick.
[01:24:34.528 --> 01:24:38.532]  And let's talk about what they actually did in terms of the audience there.
[01:24:38.532 --> 01:24:44.857]  As they pointed out, for the people who wanted tickets, they said, thousands of people are lining up to try to get tickets to the GOP debate.
[01:24:45.257 --> 01:24:55.224]  They said, well, if we were to do that, we would need a venue that was 11 times the size of that Peace Center to let everybody who wanted to get a ticket get a ticket through the lottery session.
[01:24:55.224 --> 01:24:59.727]  There were less than 2,000 seats at that center where they had it.
[01:25:00.572 --> 01:25:12.079]  And of course, the South Carolina chairman of the Greenville County Republican Party, Chad Groover, who was in charge of this, said the Republican National Committee gave a lot of tickets to supporters.
[01:25:12.079 --> 01:25:17.743]  He said more are then allocated by the state party to distribute along with the county chairs.
[01:25:17.743 --> 01:25:19.484]  He says, I didn't have hundreds of tickets.
[01:25:19.484 --> 01:25:21.566]  I had maybe a dozen tickets, he said.
[01:25:21.566 --> 01:25:26.209]  He said he gave tickets to supporters, including elected officials who work hard for the party.
[01:25:26.869 --> 01:25:31.373]  And then we see this article from Breitbart and they point out a little bit more detail.
[01:25:31.373 --> 01:25:39.140]  They say Senator Lindsey Graham and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley were personally given scores of tickets to distribute.
[01:25:40.087 --> 01:25:51.690]  Both of them have publicly pointed out how much they despise Donald Trump, and I guess Lindsey Graham was, as Ann Coulter would say, as excited as if he was in a fabric store.
[01:25:51.690 --> 01:25:54.351]  That's a great put-down of Lindsey Graham.
[01:25:54.351 --> 01:25:59.153]  But they point out, only 600 tickets were distributed to the GOP campaign.
[01:25:59.153 --> 01:26:02.694]  So in other words, Trump had 100 tickets, and the rest of the 2,000 tickets went to
[01:26:04.594 --> 01:26:10.107]  Other candidates and mainly to the RNC, to the establishment.
[01:26:10.107 --> 01:26:11.450]  But look at this article here.
[01:26:12.541 --> 01:26:15.322]  On the Drudge Report, you see Trump and Drudge for the win.
[01:26:15.322 --> 01:26:16.983]  This is a Salon article.
[01:26:16.983 --> 01:26:19.524]  They say, Trump and Drudge for the win again.
[01:26:19.524 --> 01:26:21.725]  Matt Drudge's army is bigger than the RNC.
[01:26:21.725 --> 01:26:25.507]  See, they didn't really fool anybody, did they?
[01:26:25.507 --> 01:26:27.508]  We could all see through it.
[01:26:27.508 --> 01:26:32.351]  And Donald Trump pointed it out very vociferously here, what was happening.
[01:26:32.351 --> 01:26:33.991]  But you can understand what was going on.
[01:26:33.991 --> 01:26:36.493]  You could understand that it was a hostile audience.
[01:26:36.493 --> 01:26:39.434]  A small, hand-picked, hostile audience.
[01:26:39.434 --> 01:26:41.275]  I don't like to see that sort of thing.
[01:26:41.835 --> 01:26:49.083]  I don't like to see the established parties coming in with their super-delegates to wipe out everybody else's votes.
[01:26:49.083 --> 01:26:50.965]  We talked about this in the Democrat race.
[01:26:50.965 --> 01:26:54.028]  Bernie Sanders, 150,000 votes, he gets 15 delegates.
[01:26:54.028 --> 01:26:56.991]  That means he got a delegate for every 10,000.
[01:26:56.991 --> 01:26:59.193]  But Hillary got the same number of delegates.
[01:26:59.193 --> 01:26:59.433]  Why?
[01:27:00.194 --> 01:27:09.704]  Because she's got connections with the superdelegates, the people who are above the ordinary rank-and-file voters in the Democrat Party.
[01:27:09.704 --> 01:27:11.847]  And of course the GOP does the same thing.
[01:27:11.847 --> 01:27:16.371]  They rig it with things like this push-poll debate that they had last night.
[01:27:17.079 --> 01:27:28.805]  And they go in, this is what Salon says, if you were gauging by the audience reactions or what the pundits said afterwards on cable news, you would think that the frontrunner of the Republican nomination, Donald Trump, had a really rough night.
[01:27:28.805 --> 01:27:31.687]  Every time he opened his mouth, he was met with loud boos.
[01:27:31.687 --> 01:27:37.870]  Trump, meanwhile, in his spin room interviews after the debate, touted the early numbers on Drudge, calling him the winner.
[01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:42.573]  Do we really still need to debate which analysis matters more?
[01:27:42.573 --> 01:27:48.358]  It's not because most GOP voters hated what Trump had to say, it's because they weren't in the audience.
[01:27:48.358 --> 01:27:49.219]  Okay?
[01:27:49.219 --> 01:28:00.267]  The chair of the RNC scraped up a bunch of GOP loyalists to build a made-for-TV, pro-establishment, anti-Trump audience to cheer on their establishment.
[01:28:00.267 --> 01:28:04.110]  More establishment candidates against the unconventional, anti-establishment Trump.
[01:28:04.110 --> 01:28:05.712]  That's exactly what happened.
[01:28:06.331 --> 01:28:16.757]  And of course, when you look at the results of the poll, I saw an early meme showing all of these different poll results, typically across the board.
[01:28:16.757 --> 01:28:20.359]  It was 70 to 80 percent in favor of Trump.
[01:28:20.359 --> 01:28:24.001]  Now, Drudge has probably got about a half million votes now.
[01:28:24.001 --> 01:28:27.083]  At about 400,000 votes, Trump had 55 percent.
[01:28:27.083 --> 01:28:29.784]  Cruz in second place was at 21 percent.
[01:28:29.784 --> 01:28:31.245]  Nobody is buying it.
[01:28:31.245 --> 01:28:31.966]  Now, when we come back,
[01:28:32.506 --> 01:28:39.713]  We're going to play some of the exchanges between, and of course, one of the booing exchanges between Trump and Jeb Bush.
[01:28:39.713 --> 01:28:45.719]  Trump called him out on his brother's lies about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
[01:28:45.719 --> 01:28:48.462]  Would any other candidate have done that in the GOP?
[01:28:48.462 --> 01:28:49.543]  No, they don't.
[01:28:49.543 --> 01:28:53.167]  That's one of the things that came out of last night's debate that was great.
[01:28:53.167 --> 01:28:54.067]  We're going to be right back.
[01:28:54.067 --> 01:28:56.350]  We're going to play that for you, as well as some other excerpts.
[01:28:57.864 --> 01:29:12.254]  My fellow InfoWarriors, I am very excited to be able to announce to you the introduction at InfoWarsLife.com of a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsLife formulations like Survival Shield X2 and Super Metal Vitality.

[01:30:00.726 --> 01:30:04.468]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:30:04.468 --> 01:30:13.872]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war as the enemy approached, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:30:13.872 --> 01:30:22.195]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:30:22.575 --> 01:30:26.938]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:30:26.938 --> 01:30:36.703]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:30:36.703 --> 01:30:42.366]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex, the latest product from Infowarslife.com.
[01:30:42.366 --> 01:30:48.270]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:30:48.670 --> 01:30:56.753]  And finally, for a limited time, when you buy the synergistic duo of AnthroPlex and Super Metal Vitality together at InfoWarsLife.com, you'll get 15% off and free shipping.
[01:30:56.753 --> 01:30:58.574]  That's a limited time.
[01:30:58.574 --> 01:30:59.694]  BrainForce is here.
[01:30:59.694 --> 01:31:01.895]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:31:01.895 --> 01:31:06.897]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:31:06.897 --> 01:31:10.198]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:31:10.198 --> 01:31:13.659]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:31:13.659 --> 01:31:15.400]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:16.541]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[01:31:16.541 --> 01:31:17.761]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:31:17.761 --> 01:31:19.742]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[01:31:19.742 --> 01:31:28.407]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:31:28.407 --> 01:31:29.328]  Shower filters.

[01:31:31.049 --> 01:31:35.131]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.

[01:31:39.934 --> 01:31:42.095]  This new four-stage filtration process
[01:31:42.335 --> 01:31:46.999]  It helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.

[01:31:58.089 --> 01:31:58.910]  Hey, everyone!
[01:31:58.910 --> 01:32:01.191]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:32:01.191 --> 01:32:05.034]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:32:05.034 --> 01:32:07.116]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:32:07.116 --> 01:32:17.404]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:32:17.404 --> 01:32:23.369]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:32:23.849 --> 01:32:38.746]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[01:32:38.766 --> 01:32:40.307]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:09.815 --> 01:33:20.187]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:20.187 --> 01:33:21.408]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:21.408 --> 01:33:24.752]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Sunday, February the 14th, 2016.
[01:33:24.752 --> 01:33:31.059]  We're going to play for you some excerpts from the debate last night, the South Carolina GOP debate.
[01:33:31.613 --> 01:33:35.914]  We're going to start out with a back and forth between Donald Trump and Jeb Bush.
[01:33:35.914 --> 01:33:44.816]  Donald Trump called out Jeb Bush's brother on lying to the American people about weapons of mass destruction and going into Iraq.
[01:33:44.816 --> 01:33:48.997]  And you can hear the crowd that was set up to rig this debate.
[01:33:48.997 --> 01:33:51.078]  You can hear them chiming in on this too.
[01:33:51.078 --> 01:33:52.498]  But it was a great exchange.
[01:33:52.498 --> 01:33:54.899]  Let's play this and then we'll comment on it afterwards.
[01:33:54.899 --> 01:33:55.759]  Let me just tell you.
[01:33:56.799 --> 01:34:01.482]  I get along with everybody, which is my obligation to my company, to myself, etc.
[01:34:01.482 --> 01:34:06.864]  Obviously, the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake, alright?
[01:34:06.864 --> 01:34:24.794]  Now, you can take it any way you want, and it took Jeb Bush, if you remember, at the beginning of his announcement, when he announced the President, it took him five days, he went back, it was a mistake, it wasn't a mistake, it took him five days before his people told him what to say, and he ultimately said, it was a mistake.
[01:34:25.114 --> 01:34:28.936]  The war in Iraq spent two trillion dollars, thousands of lives.
[01:34:28.936 --> 01:34:29.896]  We don't even have it.
[01:34:29.896 --> 01:34:34.498]  Iran is taking over Iraq with the second largest oil reserves in the world.
[01:34:34.498 --> 01:34:36.479]  Obviously it was a mistake.
[01:34:36.479 --> 01:34:38.280]  George Bush made a mistake.
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:39.520]  We can make mistakes.
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:40.881]  But that one was a beauty.
[01:34:40.881 --> 01:34:42.842]  We should have never been in Iraq.
[01:34:42.842 --> 01:34:45.103]  We have destabilized the Middle East.
[01:34:45.103 --> 01:34:47.884]  So you still think he should be impeached?
[01:34:47.884 --> 01:34:49.025]  I think it's my turn.
[01:34:49.025 --> 01:34:50.245]  You do whatever you want.
[01:34:50.245 --> 01:34:51.506]  You call it whatever you want.
[01:34:51.506 --> 01:34:52.106]  I want to tell you.
[01:34:52.486 --> 01:34:54.506]  You sent us to war by lies?
[01:34:54.506 --> 01:34:55.467]  You think it should be impeached?
[01:34:55.467 --> 01:34:56.587]  Keep going, keep going.
[01:34:56.587 --> 01:34:58.047]  And they knew there were none.
[01:34:58.047 --> 01:35:00.748]  There were no weapons of mass destruction.
[01:35:00.748 --> 01:35:01.588]  They knew it.
[01:35:01.588 --> 01:35:02.408]  Listen to that!
[01:35:02.408 --> 01:35:03.688]  The crowd is booing that!
[01:35:03.688 --> 01:35:05.128]  That's a fact!
[01:35:05.128 --> 01:35:06.129]  That's a fact!
[01:35:06.129 --> 01:35:11.910]  I get to do it five or six times or just once responding to that?
[01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:13.670]  So here's the deal.
[01:35:13.670 --> 01:35:17.951]  I'm sick and tired of Barack Obama blaming my brother for all of the problems that he's had.
[01:35:19.934 --> 01:35:27.818]  Frankly okay, so he if you blame him you're like Barack Obama about the insults that Donald Trump gives to me It's bloodsport for him.
[01:35:27.818 --> 01:35:33.961]  He enjoys it, and I'm glad he's happy about it Hold it right here pause it right here pause it right here, okay?
[01:35:33.961 --> 01:35:35.482]  We're gonna pick up with that now.
[01:35:35.482 --> 01:35:39.684]  I want to tell you what he's going to do I'm gonna do a Chris Christie for you at this point
[01:35:40.484 --> 01:35:43.526]  Jeb Bush goes into a recording, okay?
[01:35:43.526 --> 01:35:48.370]  This is a technique, a defense technique, that they tell them to do, just like Marco Rubio.
[01:35:48.370 --> 01:35:49.390]  You're getting attacked.
[01:35:49.390 --> 01:35:52.032]  You've got incoming missiles, just like you're a plane, okay?
[01:35:52.032 --> 01:35:52.933]  What do you do?
[01:35:52.933 --> 01:35:57.136]  You release the chaff and try to throw people off of the track.
[01:35:57.136 --> 01:36:07.003]  So now what he's going to do is he's going to give a canned speech about how proud he is of his family, and he's been repeating this speech all across South Carolina last week.
[01:36:07.443 --> 01:36:08.444]  This is what he's going to do.
[01:36:08.444 --> 01:36:11.405]  First of all, he's going to say, you're like Barack Obama.
[01:36:11.405 --> 01:36:26.392]  If you accuse my brother of lying to the American people and starting a war that killed American soldiers and millions in Iraq, OK, and set the Middle East on fire, if you accuse me of that, you're like Barack Obama.
[01:36:26.392 --> 01:36:28.693]  And oh, by the way, my family is great.
[01:36:28.693 --> 01:36:29.594]  Let's play the rest of this.
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:33.301]  I'm tired of him going after my family.
[01:36:33.301 --> 01:36:35.981]  My dad is the greatest man alive in my mind.
[01:36:35.981 --> 01:36:36.721]  In your mind.
[01:36:36.721 --> 01:36:38.122]  In your mind.
[01:36:38.122 --> 01:36:38.942]  In your mind only.
[01:36:38.942 --> 01:36:46.303]  When Donald Trump was doing a reality TV show, my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe.
[01:36:46.303 --> 01:36:46.703]  Oh!
[01:36:46.703 --> 01:36:47.124]  Oh!
[01:36:47.124 --> 01:36:47.644]  Stop that.
[01:36:47.644 --> 01:36:48.684]  Stop that right there.
[01:36:48.684 --> 01:36:49.104]  Yeah.
[01:36:49.104 --> 01:36:53.385]  While Donald Trump was doing a reality TV show, Innocent Entertainment,
[01:36:54.042 --> 01:36:59.526]  His brother was creating a surveillance police state with the Patriot Act!
[01:36:59.526 --> 01:37:00.467]  Oh, yeah, great.
[01:37:00.467 --> 01:37:01.828]  We're proud of that, aren't we?
[01:37:01.828 --> 01:37:02.389]  Proud of that.
[01:37:02.389 --> 01:37:03.750]  Good job, Jeb.
[01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:04.691]  Good job.
[01:37:04.691 --> 01:37:06.612]  That's what we got from his brother.
[01:37:06.612 --> 01:37:08.554]  And we get more lies from him.
[01:37:08.554 --> 01:37:12.857]  Go ahead and finish out the clip.
[01:37:12.857 --> 01:37:13.598]  There goes the bell.
[01:37:19.923 --> 01:37:21.664]  I just had the gall to go after my mother.
[01:37:21.664 --> 01:37:24.425]  Look, I won the lottery when I was born.
[01:37:24.425 --> 01:37:27.547]  He's still trying to do the same thing that Rubio did.
[01:37:27.547 --> 01:37:30.549]  He's still going back to his talking points.
[01:37:30.549 --> 01:37:31.869]  I won the lottery with my mother.
[01:37:37.148 --> 01:37:38.209]  Yeah, okay.
[01:37:38.209 --> 01:37:42.471]  Go back to your little tired sound bites that you've rehearsed, Jeb.
[01:37:42.471 --> 01:37:47.233]  Let me read you a story from Politico that I thought was very interesting, came out last week.
[01:37:47.233 --> 01:37:53.897]  Jeb Bush, the un-candidate, behind the would-be juggernaut lay a candidate who'd never won a competitive election.
[01:37:53.897 --> 01:37:55.457]  This is from Politico.
[01:37:55.457 --> 01:37:55.998]  And, of course,
[01:37:56.678 --> 01:38:03.943]  If you were to listen to the commentators last night and listen to the pundits, Jeb Bush did a great job in that exchange and the rest of it.
[01:38:03.943 --> 01:38:04.844]  I mean, really?
[01:38:04.844 --> 01:38:05.364]  Really?
[01:38:05.364 --> 01:38:09.127]  He just doubled down on the lies of his brother?
[01:38:09.127 --> 01:38:16.132]  Everybody admits that they lied to the public about WND being in Iraq.
[01:38:16.132 --> 01:38:17.373]  But anyway, this is what happened.
[01:38:17.933 --> 01:38:24.078]  Last year, this guy says, this is a reporter from Politico, Michael J. Myshak, if I'm pronouncing his last name correctly.
[01:38:24.078 --> 01:38:26.940]  He said, Jeb Bush banned me from the bus.
[01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:31.803]  It was October 2014, two months before he would announce he was exploring a run for president.
[01:38:31.803 --> 01:38:36.307]  He said, I had come to West Texas as an AP reporter to ask about his plans.
[01:38:36.747 --> 01:38:44.070]  And he was there enjoying a victory lap with his son, George P., who was going to be elected as Texas Land Commissioner.
[01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:50.492]  And he says, I was told that neither I nor my questions about the 2016 presidential race would be allowed.
[01:38:50.492 --> 01:38:51.773]  So he wasn't able to get on the bus.
[01:38:51.773 --> 01:38:54.153]  But his colleague did get on the bus.
[01:38:54.153 --> 01:39:01.396]  And he says, as my colleague turned his questioning toward the upcoming campaign, Jeb stopped him and said, you're about to get ready.
[01:39:01.396 --> 01:39:04.377]  You're about to get a 15-yard penalty and a loss of down here.
[01:39:04.377 --> 01:39:06.158]  It's OK, but the flag is out.
[01:39:06.578 --> 01:39:12.181]  In other words, shut up, don't talk about what I don't want to talk about, or I'm going to throw you out of the bus as well.
[01:39:12.181 --> 01:39:25.128]  He says, Jeb would boldly declare that he could upend the 2016 nomination process, he could avoid being drawn into the conservative gamesmanship of a primary, and winnow the field with an unprecedented fundraising operation.
[01:39:25.128 --> 01:39:28.590]  He called his campaign technique, shock and awe.
[01:39:28.590 --> 01:39:30.290]  Where did we hear that from?
[01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:33.872]  That phrase, that came from the other Bushes, okay?
[01:39:35.745 --> 01:39:38.448]  Who's in a shock and awe campaign right now?
[01:39:38.448 --> 01:39:39.249]  It's Jeb Bush.
[01:39:39.249 --> 01:39:47.438]  I think the shock and awe is the fact that he can't get beyond single digits, pretty much anywhere except in New Hampshire.
[01:39:47.438 --> 01:39:55.747]  And if you look at where he's polling nationally, if you look at where he polled in these online polls that happened last night, again, as I pointed out in the Drudge Report,
[01:39:57.114 --> 01:40:05.923]  When it was about 153,000 votes, Trump was at 60%, Cruz at 20, Rubio at 10, Jeb was barely even showing up.
[01:40:05.923 --> 01:40:07.084]  He was basically a flat line.
[01:40:07.084 --> 01:40:11.728]  It's now at nearly 600,000 and Trump is holding still at 54%.
[01:40:11.728 --> 01:40:15.772]  If you look at these other polls, it's also interesting.
[01:40:15.772 --> 01:40:18.695]  None of them have the kind of numbers that the Drudge Report poll has.
[01:40:19.235 --> 01:40:29.362]  But if you look at Time Magazine, you still got Donald Trump at 70%, you got Kasich at 8, Rubio at 11, and that was about 11,000 at the time they took a snapshot on that.
[01:40:29.362 --> 01:40:35.346]  Same thing with Right Scoop, 75% for Trump, he had Cruz at 10%.
[01:40:35.346 --> 01:40:42.752]  The Blaze, even The Blaze, where Glenn Beck has pulled out all the stops for his buddy Ted Cruz, even on The Blaze.
[01:40:42.752 --> 01:40:44.113]  People who listen to that rag.
[01:40:44.913 --> 01:40:49.016]  45% for Trump and 34% for Cruz.
[01:40:49.016 --> 01:40:52.599]  So he's 11% higher even on the blazes polls.
[01:40:52.599 --> 01:40:55.141]  And again, look at another Fox 5 report.
[01:40:55.141 --> 01:41:03.968]  It's 80% for Trump, 8% for Rubio, and Kasich comes up in third place on some of these more liberal news media outlets.
[01:41:03.968 --> 01:41:05.029]  The bottom line is this.
[01:41:06.283 --> 01:41:08.745]  Jeb Bush is getting desperate.
[01:41:08.745 --> 01:41:10.746]  Jeb Bush is getting angry.
[01:41:10.746 --> 01:41:14.609]  And you can see it coming out repeatedly.
[01:41:14.609 --> 01:41:20.112]  And I thought it was also interesting to see his comments about what should happen with the Scalia replacement.
[01:41:20.112 --> 01:41:22.114]  This is an article on WND.
[01:41:22.114 --> 01:41:25.916]  He was interviewed this morning with CNN anchor Dana Bash.
[01:41:25.916 --> 01:41:33.882]  And she said, Senator Cruz, Rubio, GOP leader Mitch McConnell all say the next president should replace Scalia, not President Obama.
[01:41:34.582 --> 01:41:36.463]  At the debate, it sounded like you disagreed.
[01:41:36.463 --> 01:41:37.304]  What's your position?
[01:41:37.304 --> 01:41:44.929]  He says, well, I think Obama's going to submit a nominee, and he goes on to say, well, it's really up to Mitch McConnell.
[01:41:44.929 --> 01:41:47.430]  It's not really important to me.
[01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:49.632]  Not really important to me.
[01:41:49.632 --> 01:41:50.853]  Oops.
[01:41:50.853 --> 01:41:52.934]  This is what we continue to see from Jeb Bush.
[01:41:52.934 --> 01:41:54.155]  All that's important to Jeb Bush.
[01:41:54.835 --> 01:41:56.275]  Is that it's his turn.
[01:41:56.275 --> 01:42:01.677]  And when you look at this Politico article, they go on to talk about the fact that he's only been in one competitive race.
[01:42:01.677 --> 01:42:07.098]  And that was in Florida, where he lost to Governor Lawton Childs.
[01:42:07.098 --> 01:42:11.999]  It was the only time he's had a situation where he didn't run essentially unopposed.
[01:42:11.999 --> 01:42:15.100]  And he got very bully-ish about that, too.
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:16.920]  It made him very, very angry.
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:20.001]  As they pointed out, Jeb had never been punched in the nose before.
[01:42:20.501 --> 01:42:29.324]  Lawton Childs put him in a headlock, gave him the longest noogie ever, and with his hair messed up, his face red, he wasn't sure what to do.
[01:42:29.324 --> 01:42:31.545]  Isn't that what he looks like today?
[01:42:31.545 --> 01:42:35.746]  Isn't that exactly what we see happening with Jeb Bush in this campaign?
[01:42:35.746 --> 01:42:37.967]  He's been put in a headlock by Donald Trump.
[01:42:38.447 --> 01:42:45.550]  He's been, uh, he's had his hair mussed up, he's been punched in the nose, and he's been given a long, long moogie.
[01:42:45.550 --> 01:42:46.631]  So sorry, Jeb.
[01:42:46.631 --> 01:42:56.315]  Looks like that exclamation point changed to a question mark, and now it's just Jeb and W. Maybe we should just say, duh, duh, duh bushes.
[01:42:56.315 --> 01:42:57.756]  We'll be right back with more debate clips.
[01:42:57.776 --> 01:43:01.038]  Feds push new plan for home visits to check on parents.
[01:43:01.038 --> 01:43:04.960]  Government-appointed monitors will assess the upbringing of children.
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:05.380]  The U.S.
[01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:15.546]  Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services has published a draft document outlining a plan that will treat families as equal partners in the raising of children.
[01:43:15.546 --> 01:43:18.968]  This opens the door for government intrusion at all levels.
[01:43:18.968 --> 01:43:26.052]  As defined in the document, family means all the people who play a role in a child's life and early childhood development.
[01:43:26.212 --> 01:43:32.175]  Government employees will intervene to provide monitoring goals for children at home and the classroom.
[01:43:32.175 --> 01:43:41.701]  If parents fail to meet the standards set, evidence-based parenting interventions will be made to ensure that children's social, emotional, and behavioral needs are met.
[01:43:41.701 --> 01:43:48.245]  The program will undoubtedly increase the likelihood of teenagers being given dangerous antidepressant drugs.
[01:43:48.245 --> 01:43:54.208]  A common theme of collectivist thinking is the idea that children belong not just to their parents, but to the state.
[01:43:54.528 --> 01:44:00.752]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:44:00.752 --> 01:44:10.479]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:44:10.479 --> 01:44:13.181]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:44:13.181 --> 01:44:16.743]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:44:16.743 --> 01:44:19.485]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system.
[01:44:19.645 --> 01:44:20.405]  We're good to go.

[01:46:02.385 --> 01:46:08.688]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:46:08.688 --> 01:46:15.671]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:46:15.971 --> 01:46:25.096]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[01:46:25.096 --> 01:46:31.258]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:46:31.258 --> 01:46:33.940]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:34.960]  We're good.
[01:47:01.731 --> 01:47:20.098]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:20.098 --> 01:47:24.780]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:28.635 --> 01:47:29.876]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:29.876 --> 01:47:38.041]  I'm David Knight and we're going to play for you in this segment a back and forth between Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz about immigration and open borders.
[01:47:38.041 --> 01:47:45.987]  And you're going to see the normally cold as ice Ted Cruz really lose it in this particular exchange.
[01:47:45.987 --> 01:47:50.209]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to let you know about the sales that are going to be expiring tonight.
[01:47:50.209 --> 01:47:53.612]  We have again the new introductory offer of AnthroPlex.
[01:47:53.612 --> 01:47:57.915]  That's our twice daily pill formulation that works synergistically with super male vitality.
[01:47:58.755 --> 01:48:01.396]  That is available in conjunction with Supermail Vitality.
[01:48:01.396 --> 01:48:02.857]  Get those two together.
[01:48:02.857 --> 01:48:05.098]  Get 15% off free shipping.
[01:48:05.098 --> 01:48:08.579]  And if you sign up for auto ship, you get an additional 10% off.
[01:48:08.579 --> 01:48:10.020]  That sale is ending tonight.
[01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:12.161]  Also, Silver Bullet, 15% off.
[01:48:12.161 --> 01:48:15.822]  And again, you can get auto ship for an additional 10% off.
[01:48:15.822 --> 01:48:19.864]  And we have a huge sale on InfoWars Select Foods.
[01:48:19.864 --> 01:48:20.564]  30 to 40% off.
[01:48:23.125 --> 01:48:28.230]  30 to 40 percent off plus free shipping if you get $50 or more.
[01:48:28.230 --> 01:48:37.538]  It's a great time to stock up on foods in these uncertain days because that food will be fresh for 25 years.
[01:48:37.538 --> 01:48:38.899]  It's all made in the U.S.
[01:48:38.899 --> 01:48:42.543]  as well as all the packaging and it will stay fresh for 25 years.
[01:48:44.264 --> 01:48:46.286]  Those specials are ending tonight.
[01:48:46.286 --> 01:48:47.647]  We've extended those through the weekend.
[01:48:47.647 --> 01:48:51.170]  They were going to end last Thursday, but we extended it through the weekend.
[01:48:51.170 --> 01:48:54.594]  For our listeners, we really appreciate your support.
[01:48:54.594 --> 01:49:05.203]  Now, we've been talking about the death of Scalia, what that will mean, and of course, Ted Cruz weighed in and says, yes, I will filibuster any attempt by Obama to replace Scalia.
[01:49:05.203 --> 01:49:07.706]  But then he went on, that's good, but then he went on and said this.
[01:49:09.133 --> 01:49:17.877]  If Donald Trump becomes President, the Second Amendment will be written out of the Constitution because it's abundantly clear Donald Trump is not a conservative.
[01:49:17.877 --> 01:49:20.678]  The Second Amendment will go away, said Ted Cruz.
[01:49:20.678 --> 01:49:23.240]  Now see, that's the problem with Ted Cruz.
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:25.000]  He is such a transparent liar.
[01:49:26.201 --> 01:49:27.402]  As a matter of fact, it was interesting.
[01:49:27.402 --> 01:49:37.408]  I saw on the Daily Mail there was a back and forth going on between, well, Piers Morgan talked about the number of years that he's known Donald Trump in private correspondence over the years.
[01:49:37.408 --> 01:49:38.989]  Of course, he was a celebrity apprentice.
[01:49:38.989 --> 01:49:40.130]  He won celebrity apprentice.
[01:49:40.130 --> 01:49:41.651]  He became a close friend of Donald Trump.
[01:49:42.558 --> 01:49:51.244]  And he was talking about how Donald Trump had mentioned politics and how he could kind of see this coming for a long time, but he wasn't sure.
[01:49:51.244 --> 01:50:02.611]  And the things that were important to Donald Trump, but one of the things that he said that I thought was interesting, because you know when Piers Morgan came to the United States and had his show, his primary object was to overthrow the Second Amendment.
[01:50:03.351 --> 01:50:07.492]  And privately, Donald Trump and Piers Morgan had words about that.
[01:50:07.492 --> 01:50:13.993]  And Donald Trump told Piers Morgan, but Piers, guns protect us from the bad guys.
[01:50:13.993 --> 01:50:15.214]  He understands that.
[01:50:15.214 --> 01:50:16.094]  He has said that.
[01:50:16.094 --> 01:50:18.494]  And he's been consistent about that over the years.
[01:50:18.494 --> 01:50:24.336]  And so for Ted Cruz to say the Second Amendment is going to be written out of the Constitution is very disturbing on a number of levels.
[01:50:24.336 --> 01:50:30.697]  First of all, let's understand the Supreme Court does not have the authority to write things out of the Constitution.
[01:50:31.357 --> 01:50:31.557]  I think?
[01:50:48.499 --> 01:50:58.309]  And we don't have a dictatorship of a president, we don't have a dictatorship of Supreme Court justices, unless we have a president and a Congress who bow down to that.
[01:50:58.309 --> 01:51:01.352]  So there needs to be an understanding of what's going on with that.
[01:51:01.352 --> 01:51:09.020]  But I want to play this exchange that happened with Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz last night over the border.
[01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:11.882]  And it kind of reminded me, I guess you could introduce this as a joke.
[01:51:12.643 --> 01:51:19.048]  You could say, an anchor baby and a Canadian walked into a presidential debate, and this is what happened.
[01:51:19.048 --> 01:51:21.249]  Let's play it.
[01:51:21.249 --> 01:51:26.453]  First of all, I don't know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn't speak Spanish.
[01:51:26.453 --> 01:51:35.779]  And second of all, the other point that I was making... Look, this is a disturbing pattern now.
[01:51:35.779 --> 01:51:38.822]  Because for a number of weeks now, Ted Cruz has just been telling lies.
[01:51:38.822 --> 01:51:40.923]  He lied about Ben Carson in Iowa.
[01:51:40.923 --> 01:51:42.164]  He lies about Planned Parenthood.
[01:51:42.664 --> 01:51:46.985]  He lies about marriage, he's lying about all sorts of things and now he makes things up.
[01:51:46.985 --> 01:51:52.086]  The bottom line is this is a campaign and people are watching it and they see the truth behind all these issues and here's the truth.
[01:51:52.086 --> 01:51:59.088]  Ted Cruz supported legalizing people that were in this country legally and only now does he say he won't.
[01:51:59.088 --> 01:52:02.649]  Okay, and so Rubio's got his own lies there.
[01:52:02.649 --> 01:52:09.831]  Does anybody see the irony there of an anchor baby and a Canadian running for president debating illegal immigration?
[01:52:11.468 --> 01:52:12.809]  That's where we are right now.
[01:52:12.809 --> 01:52:33.860]  And so as this is coming out, you know, he tries to shame Ted Cruz for not speaking Spanish, and so Ted Cruz takes the debate and what roughly translates to, according to CBS, Marco, if you want, right now, say it right now, in Spanish if you want, and says, so we're going to be frank and tell you, tell those of you who don't speak Spanish, that what Cruz said was kind of grammatically an unorthodox thing.
[01:52:33.860 --> 01:52:36.782]  You might say when you're flustered, when non-fluent,
[01:52:37.202 --> 01:52:39.384]  Or when trying intentionally to sound tough.
[01:52:39.384 --> 01:52:41.907]  And so it really got under his skin.
[01:52:41.907 --> 01:52:44.269]  He really lost his cool with it.
[01:52:44.269 --> 01:52:49.295]  And I guess really now, you know, we don't really have to worry about citizenship eligibility.
[01:52:49.295 --> 01:52:52.958]  We don't have to worry about the meaning of natural born citizen and whether or not we're eligible.
[01:52:52.958 --> 01:52:56.983]  Now it's just really important as to whether or not you can speak Spanish for your bona fides, right?
[01:52:58.001 --> 01:53:04.527]  See, the thing about Ted Cruz is, he says he's going to appoint an originalist judge like Scalia, for example.
[01:53:04.527 --> 01:53:09.992]  And yet, he will not give us, he says, I've argued before the Supreme Court and I know what an actual born citizen is.
[01:53:09.992 --> 01:53:12.574]  Well, then tell us what your interpretation of it is.
[01:53:12.574 --> 01:53:15.357]  You have the right and the responsibility to do that.
[01:53:15.877 --> 01:53:23.960]  But I want to play for you what Alex Jones said about the upcoming visit for the Pope, because of course the Pope is coming here to sell open borders.
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:30.603]  Open borders, a global commission to manage our economy, the TPP, and also a global tax regime and carbon taxes.
[01:53:30.603 --> 01:53:33.244]  That's what the climate change regime is about.
[01:53:33.244 --> 01:53:43.108]  All three of those are being pushed on us and one of the key salesmen of that is the Pope.
[01:53:43.108 --> 01:53:44.029]  And finally tonight,
[01:53:45.404 --> 01:53:47.165]  The hypocrisy of hypocrisy.
[01:53:47.165 --> 01:53:48.585]  It truly takes the cake.
[01:53:48.585 --> 01:53:58.929]  Pope Francis is down in Mexico City today and he's traveling up to be in Juarez across from the Texas border and El Paso.
[01:53:58.929 --> 01:54:07.192]  And he is criticizing Juarez and other cities for their drug trafficking and their money laundering and working with El Diablo.
[01:54:07.412 --> 01:54:15.159]  The head of the Catholic Church met with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and delivered a message.
[01:54:15.159 --> 01:54:29.771]  Each time we seek the path of privilege or benefit for the few, society becomes fertile ground for corruption, the drug trade, the exclusion of different cultures, the violence, and also human trafficking, kidnapping, and killing.
[01:54:31.246 --> 01:54:43.234]  Vatican City has been connected to, implicated, and proven to be involved in massive money laundering and massive drug dealing in the last hundred years.
[01:54:43.234 --> 01:54:47.958]  They were involved in helping ship out 30-plus thousand Nazis to the U.S.
[01:54:47.958 --> 01:54:50.600]  in the Rat Line, an Operation Paperclip.
[01:54:51.360 --> 01:55:02.984]  When he was a Cardinal down in South America, the parties he was involved in were involved in all sorts of death squads and disappearances of people and corruption and narcotics trafficking.
[01:55:02.984 --> 01:55:10.726]  I mean, it's like watching Don Corleone in The Godfather sit in judgment over a capo that did something.
[01:55:10.726 --> 01:55:15.548]  It'd be like watching Hitler run the Nuremberg Trials and convicting Hermann Goring to death.
[01:55:17.355 --> 01:55:26.384]  Western governments and mega banks on record made drugs illegal in the 30s because worldwide they didn't have alcohol prohibition in the US and other similar things.
[01:55:26.384 --> 01:55:34.251]  They wanted to jack up the prices, have a black market they controlled to corrupt the police, and then control the sex trade and everything else.
[01:55:34.251 --> 01:55:36.694]  And to have this Pope, the king of hypocrisy,
[01:55:38.493 --> 01:55:41.975]  Sit there and also say that you must let the immigrants in.
[01:55:41.975 --> 01:55:43.456]  It's so horrible you don't let them in.
[01:55:43.456 --> 01:55:46.838]  He didn't tell Mexico to let immigrants in from Guatemala to Mexico South.
[01:55:46.838 --> 01:55:50.220]  They have some of the strictest controls in the world in Mexico.
[01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:58.184]  No, he said America isn't letting in enough, even though we've let in 40 million in the last 20 years conservatively and let them have their babies for free, everything.
[01:55:58.184 --> 01:56:01.546]  He sits there and uses racial politics for divide and conquer.
[01:56:01.546 --> 01:56:05.469]  When we were just at Vatican City last year, some of their walls
[01:56:06.209 --> 01:56:09.031]  Are 200 plus feet tall.
[01:56:09.031 --> 01:56:11.474]  And they have armed guards with machine guns.
[01:56:11.474 --> 01:56:16.978]  How about, he says, everybody from Latin America, go to Vatican City and be there.
[01:56:16.978 --> 01:56:22.583]  It's all about class warfare, it's all about globalism, it's all about world government that he's been calling for.
[01:56:22.583 --> 01:56:24.985]  And that's what this comes down to, and that's what's so disgusting.
[01:56:26.368 --> 01:56:29.771]  So Pope Francis is truly a piece of work.
[01:56:29.771 --> 01:56:37.438]  The media criticized Donald Trump last week for just saying, Pope Francis is very political, that was the quote, and he doesn't understand our problems in America and all the crime coming over.
[01:56:37.438 --> 01:56:44.083]  And the media's like, how dare him get, with CNN, how dare Trump get political when the Pope didn't get political?
[01:56:44.083 --> 01:56:47.947]  So everything is lies, and you know when the mainstream media starts backing a Pope?
[01:56:47.947 --> 01:56:51.110]  So you can say what you want about the Vatican, they used to really criticize it.
[01:56:51.940 --> 01:56:57.766]  They are after anybody now that doesn't go along with getting rid of our borders and bringing in world government.
[01:56:57.766 --> 01:56:59.568]  It is a truly sick joke.
[01:56:59.568 --> 01:57:07.816]  If the Pope wanted to end the poverty in Mexico and the big problems down there, he would speak out against the big land barons and the colonialism they still have in place.
[01:57:07.816 --> 01:57:14.983]  And he would more importantly say we should decriminalize drugs, not legalize, but decriminalize to take the profit motive out of it.
[01:57:14.983 --> 01:57:15.704]  Pope Francis
[01:57:18.118 --> 01:57:26.025]  is a incredible politician and so we have a right to now criticize him because he's not a religious leader.
[01:57:26.025 --> 01:57:34.854]  He is a pimp selling the world government agenda and the EU takeover of the planet 110% and wealth redistribution to help the poor.
[01:57:34.854 --> 01:57:39.098]  Another scam like Obamacare that only gives the bankers trillions more.
[01:57:39.098 --> 01:57:40.679]  You want to get screwed over?
[01:57:40.679 --> 01:57:41.680]  Sit on Papa's leg.
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:42.581]  He'll take good care of you.
[01:57:43.706 --> 01:57:48.448]  Join us again tomorrow at 11 Central, Noon Eastern for the Alex Jones Radio.
[01:58:02.173 --> 01:58:03.534]  I was kind of run down.
[01:58:03.534 --> 01:58:05.474]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[01:58:05.474 --> 01:58:07.335]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[01:58:07.335 --> 01:58:09.176]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[01:58:09.176 --> 01:58:10.236]  I popped two of them.
[01:58:10.236 --> 01:58:14.497]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like everything just kind of clears up.
[01:58:14.497 --> 01:58:15.978]  It's got four and a half stars.
[01:58:15.978 --> 01:58:17.298]  People really love it.
[01:58:17.298 --> 01:58:17.899]  Read about it.
[01:58:17.899 --> 01:58:21.740]  Find out why third party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:27.022]  Because it really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:58:27.202 --> 01:58:31.247]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[01:58:31.247 --> 01:58:37.394]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[01:58:37.394 --> 01:58:43.301]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:58:50.663 --> 01:58:54.387]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:58:54.387 --> 01:59:03.816]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war as the enemy approached, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:59:03.816 --> 01:59:12.144]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:59:12.504 --> 01:59:16.886]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:59:16.886 --> 01:59:26.632]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:59:26.632 --> 01:59:32.314]  I personally counter this onslaught with Entroplex, the latest product from Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:32.314 --> 01:59:35.176]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[01:59:35.356 --> 01:59:38.618]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:59:38.618 --> 01:59:46.683]  And finally, for a limited time, when you buy the synergistic duo of Anthroplex and Super Metal Vitality together at Infowarslife.com, you'll get 15% off and free shipping.
[01:59:46.683 --> 01:59:47.624]  That's a limited time.
