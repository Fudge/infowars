[00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:22.343]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.524 --> 00:00:25.466]  It's Wednesday, November 23rd, 2016.
[00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:27.187]  I'm your host, Margaret Howell.
[00:00:27.287 --> 00:00:28.708]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:48.081]  Tonight, after a series of nationwide ambush attacks of police officers, anti-Trump communist protesters hit the streets of Austin, Texas, and they are calling for more violence and the murders of more cops.
[00:00:54.745 --> 00:01:05.011]  Then, Hampshire College in Massachusetts got so triggered by the election of Donald Trump that they decided to lower the American flag at half-staff.
[00:01:05.412 --> 00:01:11.956]  And when patriotic Americans complained about it, they simply removed the flag from the school entirely.
[00:01:12.796 --> 00:01:17.544]  Look who's become the most influential media outlet in America.
[00:01:17.724 --> 00:01:19.608]  That's right, InfoWars.
[00:01:19.868 --> 00:01:21.951]  Making freedom go viral.

[00:01:30.762 --> 00:01:33.164]  I want to thank the listeners and viewers of InfoWars.
[00:01:33.204 --> 00:01:34.425]  We've changed the world.
[00:01:34.945 --> 00:01:41.330]  Even Maytree Media admits that we're bigger than CNN, we're as big as Fox, we're bigger than the BBC, on Quantcast, you name it.
[00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:52.239]  I want to thank you all for your support, and on this Thanksgiving and this Black Friday that's coming up, we're going to extend free shipping, store-wide, to people specifically that have the promo code FREE.

[00:02:26.482 --> 00:02:32.127]  But from myself, the InfoWars family, and everybody else in this fight, I want to salute and thank all of you for your support.
[00:02:32.167 --> 00:02:35.769]  Whatever you do, keep spreading the articles, the videos, to everybody you know.
[00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.514]  It is absolutely devastating to the globalists because we're on the march and the frickin' empire is on the run.
[00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.552]  Well, I'm Margaret Hall for InfoWars.com.
[00:03:06.572 --> 00:03:08.073]  We have a ton of news to get through.
[00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:08.994]  Let's just jump right in.
[00:03:09.014 --> 00:03:10.195]  We're going to start with Iran.
[00:03:10.616 --> 00:03:12.597]  This coming out of the news cycle today.
[00:03:12.658 --> 00:03:14.019]  I found this on Yahoo News.
[00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:23.087]  Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said today in Tehran that he's going to retaliate in the event that sanctions are approved through our U.S.
[00:03:23.127 --> 00:03:23.508]  Congress.
[00:03:23.548 --> 00:03:26.451]  Now, this is coming on the heels of Barack Obama leaving office.
[00:03:27.111 --> 00:03:27.171]  And
[00:03:45.536 --> 00:03:45.596]  I'm
[00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:05.391]  I think?
[00:04:24.887 --> 00:04:28.010]  We know that Trump is less than 60 days away from assuming office.
[00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.952]  It cannot come soon enough, frankly, folks.
[00:04:29.972 --> 00:04:37.981]  And the fact that our Congress, our lawmakers, they're trying to ram this bill through to make sure that they can reimpose these sanctions.
[00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:41.104]  It looks like they're finally stepping up and doing their job.
[00:04:41.544 --> 00:04:45.749]  But Iran did not miss the opportunity to say, you know what, we're going to retaliate.
[00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:48.711]  Whatever that means, I guess we're going to have to wait and see.
[00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:53.835]  We know what they did to US hostages in 1979 because they didn't get their way.
[00:04:53.855 --> 00:05:01.921]  I can only guess what retaliate means, but it looks like our Congress is finally doing their job and trying to reimpose those sanctions.
[00:05:01.981 --> 00:05:09.047]  Now, while Iran is chanting death to America on their streets, unfortunately, we have a similar situation here in the United States.
[00:05:09.127 --> 00:05:11.048]  We have anti-Trump protesters.
[00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:17.511]  That are chanting for more cop killings after the spate of nationwide murders of police officers.
[00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:18.791]  Of course, we cover this article.
[00:05:19.191 --> 00:05:21.492]  Paul Joseph Watson, one of our own, put this up.
[00:05:21.892 --> 00:05:22.832]  It's on our website.
[00:05:22.892 --> 00:05:28.074]  These anti-Trump communist protesters, they were actually here in the city of Austin and they were chanting.
[00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:34.296]  And I cannot believe that they were doing this in plain sight as police officers were in their cars nearby.
[00:05:34.716 --> 00:05:39.639]  This is what they were chanting, with some of them dressed in hammer and sickle-faced masks, like communists.
[00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:48.905]  The agitators, they shouted, F-U-C-K, police, as they marched down the sidewalk, while others stuck up their middle fingers, while cops were in nearby vehicles.
[00:05:48.985 --> 00:05:51.227]  What's better than one dead cop?
[00:05:51.587 --> 00:05:53.609]  Two dead cops, they could be heard shouting.
[00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:55.049]  And you know what?
[00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:07.117]  You'd think that this would be an arrestable offense, threatening the lives of police officers in front of them while your middle finger's up, basically saying that we're going to kill you, we want you all to die.
[00:06:07.137 --> 00:06:13.542]  We've had a spate of cop murders in this country, one alarmingly close to Austin in San Antonio.
[00:06:14.322 --> 00:06:19.063]  And these ambush-style attacks is what we're talking about against our law enforcement.
[00:06:19.643 --> 00:06:38.267]  And the Black Lives Matter activist that has inspired the entire movement we know was a convicted cop killer herself, which doesn't seem to have any impact on our current presidential administration, who in fact wants Black Lives Matter activists to come to the table and actually come into the White House
[00:06:38.667 --> 00:06:44.850]  And talk about how we can all come together and support the movement, despite them chanting that cops should die in our country.
[00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:53.375]  Now, Trump, I mentioned this earlier, this murdered San Antonio police officer, this man on Sunday, his name was Benjamin Marconi.
[00:06:53.415 --> 00:06:55.876]  He was a detective in San Antonio.
[00:06:56.236 --> 00:07:03.520]  He was actually writing a ticket to somebody and he was shot and killed in the head, a random cop shooting.
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.881]  And where was our president?
[00:07:05.641 --> 00:07:08.161]  No word on Barack Obama reaching out to his family.
[00:07:08.482 --> 00:07:21.664]  The good news is, though, President-elect Donald Trump reportedly phoned his family, Officer Marconi's family, and Dane Gregory Marconi, who was a spokesperson for the family, he wrote this on Facebook.
[00:07:21.684 --> 00:07:25.344]  It was not available for public viewing, but the San Antonio Express News picked it up.
[00:07:25.865 --> 00:07:27.845]  Donald Trump Jr., of course, retweeting it.
[00:07:28.445 --> 00:07:29.405]  This is what he had to say.
[00:07:29.465 --> 00:07:31.726]  He said, just got off the phone with the future President Trump.
[00:07:31.766 --> 00:07:33.766]  He sends his condolences to our family.
[00:07:34.526 --> 00:07:35.667]  And you know what?
[00:07:35.727 --> 00:07:48.378]  That's what a president should be doing, standing behind our fallen officers and their families and offering condolences for such a heinous, despicable crime, which is advocated by Black Lives Matter.
[00:07:48.518 --> 00:07:51.140]  Now, that's going on in the streets.
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:08:02.470]  And meanwhile, on our college campuses, places like this Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, they're flying their flags at half-masked, half-staffed, excuse me,
[00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:18.789]  In the wake of the presidential election, I kid you not, and the spokesperson for the school, they actually had the audacity to say that it was going to provoke meaningful and respectful dialogue on the campus because they're flying their flags half-staffed.
[00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.511]  I can't make this up, folks.
[00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:21.853]  It's actual news.
[00:08:22.633 --> 00:08:29.079]  The fact that we have a President Trump means that it's a time of grief and mourning for this ridiculous outfit.
[00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:36.486]  I shudder to think what kids are paying in tuition to go to that school where they're mourning the election of a president.
[00:08:37.507 --> 00:08:38.287]  That's going on.
[00:08:38.347 --> 00:08:45.970]  Now we understand here at Infowars the role that the mainstream media played in trying to take down Donald Trump very unsuccessfully with their lies.
[00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:51.172]  They call us fake news, but in fact they're the real fake news spouting these lies.
[00:08:51.232 --> 00:08:54.093]  We try to give you the real truth in real time as we find it.
[00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:55.074]  We work really hard.
[00:08:55.094 --> 00:08:57.214]  Our staff does this on the ground each and every day.
[00:08:57.234 --> 00:09:00.896]  And Donald Trump, I love this story coming out of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:09:01.756 --> 00:09:05.757]  He actually criticized, he hauled all of the TV network executives in a room.
[00:09:06.218 --> 00:09:29.806]  Reportedly CNN president Jeff Zucker, Fox News co-president Jack Abernathy and Bill Shine, ABC News president James Goldstein, CBS News vice president Chris Isham, along with on-air bigwigs like Lester Holt, shame on you Mr. Holt by the way, CBS's Charlie Rose, ABC's George Stephanopoulos, and CNN's Wolf Blitzer.
[00:09:30.206 --> 00:09:38.051]  And he gave them a little talking to about their lies, about the hoodwinking that's gone on on their shows, frankly.
[00:09:38.572 --> 00:09:47.918]  And we put this article up on Infowars.com where Trump, it's entitled, Trump tells TV executives to their face, I hate you, you liars.
[00:09:48.138 --> 00:09:49.779]  Alex Jones breaks it down.
[00:09:49.799 --> 00:09:50.820]  Take a listen.
[00:09:52.438 --> 00:09:56.139]  President-elect slams smug media and face-to-face at Trump Tower.
[00:09:56.639 --> 00:09:58.020]  We're in a room of liars.
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.661]  The deceitful, dishonest media who got it all wrong.
[00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:05.902]  Supposed to be an off-the-record meeting, but the Trump folks have confirmed this one on.
[00:10:06.202 --> 00:10:07.543]  He told them, look, I hate you.
[00:10:09.163 --> 00:10:09.783]  You hate me.
[00:10:10.324 --> 00:10:11.244]  Let's just be honest.
[00:10:11.324 --> 00:10:13.425]  You work for corporate execs that are fools.
[00:10:13.805 --> 00:10:14.925]  You've bankrupted yourselves.
[00:10:14.945 --> 00:10:15.845]  You have no credibility.
[00:10:16.346 --> 00:10:17.746]  And I just want to declare that you're scum.
[00:10:17.766 --> 00:10:20.567]  That's exactly what I'd tell them.
[00:10:21.715 --> 00:10:23.156]  The New York Times and stuff want to talk to me.
[00:10:23.216 --> 00:10:30.279]  I go, are you talking to me as a prop to pretend we're doing an interview?
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:40.923]  And I loved watching so-called journalists like Stephanopoulos and people scurrying out of there.
[00:10:41.923 --> 00:10:46.185]  And Wolf Blitzer looked like he'd been flogged with a cat or nine tails when he left.
[00:10:47.206 --> 00:10:50.107]  Donald Trump's media summit was an effing firing squad.
[00:10:52.642 --> 00:10:58.270]  He told Jeff Zucker, quote, I hate your network, everyone at CNN is a liar, and you should be ashamed.
[00:11:04.099 --> 00:11:05.361]  I'm sorry, this is just too good.
[00:11:06.527 --> 00:11:07.368]  Oh, that's too good.
[00:11:07.448 --> 00:11:08.769]  Trump knows exactly what to do.
[00:11:09.289 --> 00:11:11.110]  We must bankrupt these organizations.
[00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:16.013]  They're already financed by kingpins and drug dealers and every other criminal organization you can imagine.
[00:11:16.033 --> 00:11:16.893]  They want to bring the country down.
[00:11:17.334 --> 00:11:18.134]  You're going down.
[00:11:18.674 --> 00:11:26.019]  Whatever little sponsorship you've got left, everybody has to contact your sponsors and say, I will never use your product if I see your ad on there one more time.
[00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:28.080]  You want to bring down America?
[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:29.340]  We're going to get in your face.
[00:11:29.361 --> 00:11:32.282]  We're going to lean on you and see how you like it, you little bullies.
[00:11:33.003 --> 00:11:35.144]  You've bullied this country around a little too long.
[00:11:36.305 --> 00:11:40.687]  Well, you talk about the fake corporate media scrambling to keep their heads on after that meeting.
[00:11:40.707 --> 00:11:41.727]  You know, it wasn't televised.
[00:11:41.787 --> 00:11:43.508]  I can only imagine how that went.
[00:11:44.068 --> 00:11:51.111]  And they have done, they've done a blatant attempt to silence anybody that criticizes them, calling us fake.
[00:11:51.131 --> 00:11:56.193]  You know, Dr. Paul in the Liberty Report, he did this amazing outline of the real fake news.
[00:11:56.773 --> 00:11:59.614]  And our own Alex Jones, he breaks that down for you in real time.
[00:11:59.634 --> 00:12:00.575]  Take a listen.
[00:12:01.329 --> 00:12:05.994]  For you to say that you're comfortable with fake news getting posted, that that's okay.
[00:12:06.114 --> 00:12:17.746]  What this is about is left-leaning mainstream media blaming conservative media for losing the election, losing credibility, and losing readers.
[00:12:18.046 --> 00:12:22.351]  Their definition of fake news is anything that doesn't align with their leftist agenda.
[00:12:22.631 --> 00:12:35.655]  Freedom of speech is staring down the barrel of a gun loaded by a cancer of global interests that have laid claim to the last remaining fragments of the First Amendment of the United States of America.
[00:12:35.895 --> 00:12:48.400]  RT reports former Congressman Ron Paul revealed a list of fake news journalists he claims are responsible for bogus wars and lies about Hillary Clinton's chances of winning the election.
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.241]  Journalists from CNN, The New York Times, and The Guardian are included.
[00:12:52.461 --> 00:13:03.989]  According to the report on his website, Ron Paul Liberty Report, this list contains the culprits who told us that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and lied us into multiple bogus wars.
[00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:18.459]  Paul claims the list is sourced and holds a lot more water than a list previously released by Melissa Zimdars, who is described by Zero Hedge as an ultra-liberal assistant professor of communications at Merrimack College.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.042]  Zimdars' list, in itself, should be considered fake.
[00:13:22.222 --> 00:13:35.050]  A list containing actual fake news sites alongside true news gathering alternative view sites that utilize a system of dissecting the mainstream narrative and its long history of fake reporting.
[00:13:35.251 --> 00:13:37.052]  Fake reporting is nothing new.
[00:13:37.172 --> 00:13:38.833]  Just ask Brian Williams.
[00:13:39.173 --> 00:13:47.797]  After a ground fire incident in the desert during the Iraq War invasion, I made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago.
[00:13:48.337 --> 00:13:54.639]  It did not take long to hear from some brave men and women in the air crews who were also in that desert.
[00:13:55.079 --> 00:13:56.260]  I want to apologize.
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.422]  I said I was traveling in an aircraft that was hit by RPG fire.
[00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:03.603]  I was instead in a following aircraft.
[00:14:03.823 --> 00:14:12.630]  With the loss of the globalist foothold and the quiet death of the Smith-Munn Act in 2013, propaganda is being waged on all fronts.
[00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:25.499]  George Orwell said, threats to freedom of speech, writing and action, though often trivial in isolation, are cumulative in their effect and unless checked, lead to a general disrespect for the rights of the citizen.
[00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:31.804]  Is the Constitution a living document, open to interpretation?
[00:14:32.644 --> 00:14:37.749]  Or is it something that must be read strictly and adhered to regardless of the day?
[00:14:37.889 --> 00:14:43.754]  You know, Scott, that is the question that is asked constantly of judges.
[00:14:44.455 --> 00:14:51.962]  And so to talk about strict interpretation or living constitution, those are not words I use.
[00:14:52.742 --> 00:14:55.305]  And they're not words that I think have much meaning.
[00:14:56.025 --> 00:14:59.747]  The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world.
[00:14:59.927 --> 00:15:01.828]  Lies will pass into history.
[00:15:01.948 --> 00:15:02.768]  George Orwell.
[00:15:03.488 --> 00:15:11.772]  You know, when we first got in there and started looking around and didn't find anything, you get that kind of sinking feeling that, uh-oh, and then time went on.
[00:15:11.812 --> 00:15:18.175]  And then we got tips, you know, I'll never forget the tip that there was crates buried, you know, hidden in the Euphrates River.
[00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:22.717]  Maybe these are them, and they've sent Frogman, and there's nothing there.
[00:15:22.877 --> 00:15:26.779]  In our age, there is no such thing as keeping out of politics.
[00:15:27.099 --> 00:15:34.823]  All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred, and schizophrenia.
[00:15:34.963 --> 00:15:35.684]  George Orwa.
[00:15:36.124 --> 00:15:39.805]  You have to represent all of the people, and the people have to believe that.
[00:15:40.266 --> 00:15:44.987]  You have to have the rule of law that applies to everyone, not just to some of the people.
[00:15:45.228 --> 00:15:50.209]  For those of you who are concerned about my using personal email, I understand.
[00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:57.872]  And I am sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year.
[00:15:57.912 --> 00:16:00.453]  There is no hate here.
[00:16:02.154 --> 00:16:12.505]  Now, speaking of fake news, because they're not happy that they were toppled and exposed and the real media got out, thanks in part to you on social media retweeting us.
[00:16:13.746 --> 00:16:19.092]  Facebook has been a critical component of getting out real news and Zuckerberg, he's reportedly taken notice.
[00:16:19.472 --> 00:16:24.415]  He's done an all-out assault on fake news, what he's calling fake news, which is actually true news.
[00:16:25.075 --> 00:16:35.741]  And Facebook, they're saying that they're creating, this was in the New York Times, on the cover yesterday by Mike Isaac, Facebook said to create censorship tool to get back into China.
[00:16:35.781 --> 00:16:47.348]  So it looks like Zuckerberg, the social network, they've been quietly developing the software to suppress posts and appearing in people's news feeds in specific geographic areas, like here in the US, with anything they don't agree with.
[00:16:47.728 --> 00:16:48.149]  We're good.
[00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:05.771]  Who cares about censorship, right?
[00:17:05.831 --> 00:17:08.473]  I mean, it's all in, you know, it's what they do anyway, frankly.
[00:17:09.113 --> 00:17:09.914]  I want to take you to this.
[00:17:09.934 --> 00:17:21.321]  The suppression software has been contentious within Facebook, which is separately grappling with what should or should not be shown to its users after the American presidential elections.
[00:17:21.482 --> 00:17:26.505]  Unexpected outcome spurred questions over fake news on the social network.
[00:17:26.885 --> 00:17:30.948]  They are not happy at all that they could not accurately suppress
[00:17:31.548 --> 00:17:31.748]  I don't
[00:17:52.708 --> 00:17:54.769]  And Facebook is not too happy about it.
[00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:59.692]  Looks like they're partnering with a Chinese company to monitor popular news stories.
[00:18:00.052 --> 00:18:01.293]  That's a shocker right there.
[00:18:01.393 --> 00:18:09.598]  Now, as they're scrambling to squelch fake news, the Democratic National Committee, of course, is in shambles given what happened with Donna Brazile.
[00:18:10.018 --> 00:18:11.159]  What a nightmare there.
[00:18:11.179 --> 00:18:13.000]  It looks like she was fired from CNN as well.
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.981]  And she had to step down because it turns out she wasn't doing too many ethical things over there.
[00:18:18.321 --> 00:18:21.542]  They're looking for a new leader right now, also on the cover of the New York Times.
[00:18:21.562 --> 00:18:23.502]  You know, I can't pass up a good story here.
[00:18:24.122 --> 00:18:29.663]  Keith Ellison is being considered for the top job and he's not without controversy.
[00:18:29.723 --> 00:18:30.863]  Of course, he is a Muslim.
[00:18:30.923 --> 00:18:33.224]  He's in Congress representing Minnesota.
[00:18:33.304 --> 00:18:39.405]  He defended Louis Farrakhan in the 90s, saying that he was not an anti-Semite, trying to position himself
[00:18:39.725 --> 00:18:40.145]  Thank you.
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:46.203]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:19:46.884 --> 00:19:48.465]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:19:48.845 --> 00:19:53.848]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:19:54.208 --> 00:19:59.652]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:20:00.052 --> 00:20:06.636]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:20:07.277 --> 00:20:08.438]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:20:09.278 --> 00:20:11.219]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:20:11.559 --> 00:20:14.501]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:20:14.941 --> 00:20:18.563]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:20:18.743 --> 00:20:21.304]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:20:21.364 --> 00:20:33.711]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:20:33.931 --> 00:20:39.053]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:20:39.153 --> 00:20:40.494]  It's bound.
[00:20:40.554 --> 00:20:41.774]  It's not absorbable.
[00:20:42.194 --> 00:20:46.756]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:20:46.976 --> 00:20:51.878]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:20:52.238 --> 00:20:55.960]  It's such a game changer if you'll just research iodine for yourself.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.681]  It's a fact that the federal government in the Midwest back in the 20s
[00:20:59.241 --> 00:21:08.206]  Mandated a grungier form of iodine to the salt because people had low IQs, they had huge goiters, major problems directly connected to it.
[00:21:08.386 --> 00:21:12.048]  There are some studies that show a 15 point increase, others show even higher.
[00:21:12.208 --> 00:21:25.656]  But it really is crazy to realize that this is something that is so deficient in our food chain, so deficient in our played out fields where different crops are being grown, but the federal government isn't educating people and telling them about it.
[00:21:25.856 --> 00:21:37.399]  That's why for a limited time, I want to encourage everyone to go to Infowarslife.com and get 20% off on the best nascent iodine out there from our research, Truly Pure Survival Shield X2.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.260]  Again, that's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.461]  Thank you for joining us in this brief news update.
[00:21:43.841 --> 00:21:48.743]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:21:48.823 --> 00:21:49.983]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:52.724]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[00:21:52.884 --> 00:21:53.104]  Of course!
[00:22:15.742 --> 00:22:18.343]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:22:18.363 --> 00:22:19.404]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:22:19.744 --> 00:22:20.444]  Iodine is key.
[00:22:20.484 --> 00:22:21.104]  You must have it.
[00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:29.008]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield niacin iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:22:29.028 --> 00:22:29.889]  We can answer your questions.
[00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:30.249]  888-253-3139.
[00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:32.630]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[00:22:43.945 --> 00:22:45.366]  It's a fight for our minds.
[00:22:46.046 --> 00:22:47.967]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[00:22:48.307 --> 00:22:52.508]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:22:52.649 --> 00:22:55.990]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:57.610]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:23:28.544 --> 00:23:30.005]  So let's talk about communism.
[00:23:30.265 --> 00:23:38.933]  This year it's been given a second win due to Bernie Sanders and the SJW crowd, who see it as a great system, and one that we should implement in our own country.
[00:23:40.714 --> 00:23:45.478]  Everyone gets what they want, everyone receives what they want, and no one has to work that hard.
[00:23:46.359 --> 00:23:48.881]  Except that's exactly wrong, and I'm gonna tell you why.
[00:23:53.499 --> 00:24:06.273]  In America, in any capitalist society, you and your fellow citizens create the environment and create the market and create supply and demand, which therefore creates an environment of competition and therefore encourages growth.
[00:24:06.773 --> 00:24:11.478]  However, in communism, the government does this very same action for you!
[00:24:12.318 --> 00:24:17.819]  Therefore, eliminating the need for your own interaction and needs and purposes.
[00:24:18.439 --> 00:24:21.600]  This means the government can basically walk all over you for the good of the group.
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:26.981]  What communism does is that it enslaves the individual for the betterment of the collective.
[00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:28.081]  The collective.
[00:24:28.141 --> 00:24:29.961]  But who is the collective, you may ask?
[00:24:30.361 --> 00:24:31.141]  This is the government.
[00:24:31.401 --> 00:24:32.161]  You don't have a say.
[00:24:32.542 --> 00:24:34.102]  In fact, you are not the real collective.
[00:24:34.842 --> 00:24:40.623]  In all these communist societies, Kim Jong-un, Stalin, Lenin, Mao, they were the collective.
[00:24:41.303 --> 00:24:52.449]  These individuals who said that they represented you and claimed that they were the group of you, that whole big government that was formed, was not for you, but it was for their own personal interests.
[00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:59.554]  And that's why no communist government has ever succeeded in any way, shape, or form other than to make weapons technology.
[00:24:59.894 --> 00:25:03.136]  There has not been one medical advancement in a communist country.
[00:25:03.416 --> 00:25:08.659]  There has not been one invention in a communist country that we all use and love today in our free world.
[00:25:08.959 --> 00:25:09.439]  We don't do it.
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:10.760]  It's because it's all crap.
[00:25:11.061 --> 00:25:21.449]  The government in those countries makes people fear and dumbs them down so that they can enforce their own tirade of unreasonable actions.
[00:25:21.749 --> 00:25:23.531]  Why are you so worried about a f***ing zyko?
[00:25:23.991 --> 00:25:26.453]  Ultimately, your sympathies do not lie with black people.
[00:25:26.473 --> 00:25:31.877]  They lie with your racist, white, middle-class agenda, and that's where it will always lie, and you will be destroyed holding that line.
[00:25:32.078 --> 00:25:34.299]  Okay, I adopted two children.
[00:25:34.319 --> 00:25:36.161]  Oh, good for you, white savior.
[00:25:36.221 --> 00:25:36.942]  Aren't you so proud?
[00:25:36.962 --> 00:25:37.422]  You're f***ing white.
[00:25:37.442 --> 00:25:38.163]  They're not white.
[00:25:39.292 --> 00:25:40.313]  How many did you adopt?
[00:25:40.333 --> 00:25:40.553]  How many?
[00:25:40.573 --> 00:25:41.033]  I kill my kids.
[00:25:41.093 --> 00:25:41.754]  I kill my kids.
[00:25:41.794 --> 00:25:43.555]  Communism is also one of the most violent
[00:26:03.567 --> 00:26:06.909]  and horrific governmental systems ever to be enacted.
[00:26:07.329 --> 00:26:14.532]  Communism has killed more than fires, alcohol abuse, and the Vietnam War in the 20th century.
[00:26:14.793 --> 00:26:15.693]  That's just ridiculous!
[00:26:16.093 --> 00:26:19.735]  Why can we even support a version of something like that?
[00:26:19.935 --> 00:26:22.697]  If it does something so horrible and kills so many.
[00:26:22.957 --> 00:26:27.641]  These governments have steamrolled millions of people in order to benefit a few.
[00:26:27.981 --> 00:26:29.602]  You know, that's what they say capitalism does.
[00:26:29.762 --> 00:26:33.525]  They say capitalism, they say it benefits only those at the top.
[00:26:34.966 --> 00:26:37.308]  If you look at communism, that's just ridiculous!
[00:26:37.728 --> 00:26:39.189]  I have heart failure!
[00:26:39.289 --> 00:26:40.510]  I don't have children!
[00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:41.951]  I f***ing love Satan!
[00:26:42.311 --> 00:26:45.073]  Say that again, who do you love?
[00:26:45.253 --> 00:26:47.335]  I f***ing love Satan, so f*** you!
[00:26:47.575 --> 00:26:50.517]  How do you get your abortions paid for?
[00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:02.231]  I pay for them.
[00:27:02.711 --> 00:27:03.091]  Really?
[00:27:03.151 --> 00:27:05.353]  How many do you pay for them?
[00:27:05.413 --> 00:27:06.033]  Upwards of 50.
[00:27:06.074 --> 00:27:06.994]  Really?
[00:27:07.134 --> 00:27:07.515]  Oh yeah.
[00:27:08.295 --> 00:27:10.777]  I raise money from the community for it.
[00:27:11.037 --> 00:27:12.198]  Oh, you don't use your money?
[00:27:13.279 --> 00:27:14.800]  You multiply your efforts, huh?
[00:27:15.361 --> 00:27:20.745]  So, you may ask, I was told that communism really cared about the people.
[00:27:20.765 --> 00:27:22.426]  It was all about their survival.
[00:27:23.887 --> 00:27:26.129]  As I've just pointed out to you, that's absolutely false.
[00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:31.113]  The only true goal that communism has is making the few
[00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:38.817]  The government officials, more powerful, and giving them all the rights and all the say.
[00:27:39.198 --> 00:27:49.751]  In 1989, in Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government rolled out a force of tanks to silence a few pro-democracy voices who were crying out for change.
[00:27:50.032 --> 00:27:51.634]  They killed them all, or most of them.
[00:27:51.894 --> 00:27:57.380]  And they sent a clear message to the rest of the world that communistic governments do not accept dissent.
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:00.043]  They do not accept voices of change.
[00:28:00.224 --> 00:28:02.967]  They do not accept people saying, hey, maybe this is wrong.
[00:28:03.127 --> 00:28:04.128]  Maybe this is incorrect.
[00:28:04.388 --> 00:28:07.552]  Only thing that they will accept is complete and blind obedience.
[00:28:07.973 --> 00:28:10.596]  And that is why I think the Chinese, the Russian,
[00:28:11.136 --> 00:28:14.158]  North Korean, all the communist governments in the whole entire world.
[00:28:14.539 --> 00:28:21.243]  This is the worst governmental system ever implemented in the history of the Earth.
[00:28:21.303 --> 00:28:22.304]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:28:22.324 --> 00:28:23.665]  What do you think about Venezuela?
[00:28:23.925 --> 00:28:28.369]  I think you're a f***ing boy and you don't know what communism means.
[00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:31.511]  So why do you think communism is going to be a good solution for the United States?
[00:28:32.071 --> 00:28:33.092]  It's a good solution for the world.
[00:28:33.112 --> 00:28:33.912]  It's the only solution.
[00:28:33.993 --> 00:28:34.193]  Really?
[00:28:35.034 --> 00:28:45.983]  But oh no, the lefties and the special snowflakes, they cry out, Communism, it's for equality, they love all, they let all in, everyone matters.
[00:28:46.563 --> 00:28:47.684]  It's not true.
[00:28:48.245 --> 00:28:52.248]  Communists have famously executed the mentally handicapped and gays.
[00:28:52.708 --> 00:28:56.952]  And Stalin tried to kill the artists and the educated because he thought they weren't valuable enough.
[00:28:57.432 --> 00:28:58.173]  I mean, come on!
[00:28:58.313 --> 00:28:58.913]  It's simple.
[00:28:59.153 --> 00:29:00.854]  It's a horrible governmental system.
[00:29:01.274 --> 00:29:03.536]  Why would anyone follow this or even approve?
[00:29:04.036 --> 00:29:13.602]  Communism is the worst, outdated, disproven, horrible system of government ever implemented on the planet.
[00:29:13.742 --> 00:29:22.148]  So while you're watching the news and seeing all the leftist Bernie supporters crying out against Trump, saying he's racist, he's sexist, he doesn't like the gays,
[00:29:23.817 --> 00:29:24.378]  I mean, come on!
[00:29:24.638 --> 00:29:25.319]  You're a communist!
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:29.244]  Well, dude, I mean, you're a communist, man.
[00:29:34.131 --> 00:29:40.340]  I've tried to reintroduce the term inside job to the nomenclature, to the language of the West.
[00:29:41.496 --> 00:29:45.558]  False flag, self-inflicted wound, frame-up.
[00:29:46.379 --> 00:29:48.400]  Everybody knows there's frame-ups in crime.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.182]  Governments sometimes frame other governments.
[00:29:51.782 --> 00:29:54.824]  Sometimes husbands plant things on their wives or vice versa.
[00:29:55.284 --> 00:29:59.706]  Sometimes employees plant things on their bosses or bosses plant things on their employees.
[00:30:00.167 --> 00:30:03.949]  Sometimes corrupt police have been caught framing people as well.
[00:30:05.199 --> 00:30:07.600]  But mainstream media says that doesn't exist.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.560]  Frame-ups aren't happening.
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:34.327]  And more and more, it'll be a tiny blurb in the back of the newspaper, or at the end of a TV newscast, that there have been staged events where somebody burns a cross in their yard, or somebody puts KKK letters on their doorstep, or individuals have swastikas put on their dorms, or a lacrosse player is raped by 15 white men because she's black.
[00:30:35.569 --> 00:30:40.372]  And I can't really think of cases where it doesn't come out that it's been staged.
[00:30:41.312 --> 00:30:50.458]  There have also been a lot of cases where white women will cut things into their faces and claim that black people did it and vice versa.
[00:30:51.223 --> 00:30:52.964]  There seems to be a fetish with this.
[00:30:53.504 --> 00:31:00.087]  There are a lot of cases of firefighters, who on average are great people, burning down buildings and calling the fire department themselves.
[00:31:00.627 --> 00:31:10.771]  The false flag, the self-inflicted wound, the stage event is admitted and is a fact in criminology and is one of the most common crimes out there.
[00:31:11.192 --> 00:31:11.852]  Now that said,
[00:31:12.947 --> 00:31:20.471]  Mainstream media, when they have these events, will not even say, hey, most of these have been staged, is this one staged?
[00:31:21.012 --> 00:31:22.893]  And there's several examples in the news today.
[00:31:23.353 --> 00:31:35.240]  NBC News has been forced to report, hateful Trump notes allegedly aimed at student were fabricated, University says, by the student themselves to garner attention.
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:36.841]  Here's the Washington Post.
[00:31:36.901 --> 00:31:42.344]  DC restaurant apologizes after hosting alt-right dinner with Sieg Heil salute.
[00:31:42.964 --> 00:31:44.804]  Now, several frame-ups are happening here.
[00:31:45.605 --> 00:31:59.828]  Number one, there's a video clip of a well-known internet personality, known for her antics, going to the event and hiling Hitler, with two men caught on video admitting that they were Jewish, coming to see the event.
[00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:12.271]  Then the media claims it's an alt-right event.
[00:32:12.892 --> 00:32:16.093]  That's a term coined by Hillary Clinton just five months ago as if she's God.
[00:32:16.813 --> 00:32:18.734]  Anybody that disagrees with her is alt-right.
[00:32:19.375 --> 00:32:21.656]  Even a lot of people that disagree with her are liberals.
[00:32:22.316 --> 00:32:25.578]  So this event probably did have some white nationalists, some racists at it.
[00:32:25.598 --> 00:32:26.338]  We've done research.
[00:32:27.179 --> 00:32:29.740]  It was the Jews there howling Hitler for the overall news story.
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:37.003]  But still, regardless, what is the media calling some perhaps possibly racist event alt-right?
[00:32:38.544 --> 00:32:45.686]  Colbright, Bart, and Infowars, and anybody that disagrees with Hillary, alt-right, then they label alt-right as racist.
[00:32:45.746 --> 00:32:48.246]  That's how they're using labeling to control people.
[00:32:48.526 --> 00:32:58.748]  In their lust to demonize Trump, they've been caught putting out fake tweets admitting he ripped people off with his university.
[00:33:02.526 --> 00:33:07.990]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:09.031]  Unveiled!
[00:33:09.431 --> 00:33:12.493]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula.
[00:33:13.174 --> 00:33:13.634]  30 servings.
[00:33:13.834 --> 00:33:16.436]  Fruit punch flavor dietary supplement.
[00:33:16.736 --> 00:33:17.797]  It is simply amazing.
[00:33:17.857 --> 00:33:18.818]  Infowarslife.com
[00:33:19.198 --> 00:33:23.600]  There's a million different products like this out there, but they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:37.227]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all of the essential amino acids, all of the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:38.808]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:40.029]  I put it in my protein shake.
[00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:46.133]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:49.175]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:51.456]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[00:33:52.057 --> 00:33:58.201]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:00.783]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[00:34:01.143 --> 00:34:03.004]  Okay, this... Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:05.346]  Yeah, this... I wanna... But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:05.726]  Yeah.
[00:34:05.946 --> 00:34:07.447]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:10.349]  There's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com that are excellent.
[00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:11.909]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.152]  This is just the very best we can bring you, and when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:39.919]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body, because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:41.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:41.087 --> 00:34:44.228]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[00:34:44.328 --> 00:34:45.568]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:46.168]  Tell folks about that.
[00:34:46.328 --> 00:34:49.088]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.589]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:55.670]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine.
[00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.510]  Each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.131]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:04.691]  34 other ones you can check out.
[00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.731]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:09.552]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:19.939]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just by the way look on the other side too because we're showing people the minerals and things let's look at the vitamins right there old Scott in there I mean it's amazing.
[00:35:19.979 --> 00:35:20.440]  Top left.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.862]  Again if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.285]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's the other source?
[00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.707]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:32.806]  Retinol.
[00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:37.328]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[00:35:37.649 --> 00:35:38.049]  And you know what?
[00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:40.290]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.110]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:48.154]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:53.997]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:55.358]  So get them today!
[00:35:55.418 --> 00:35:59.441]  Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:00.442 --> 00:36:01.983]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:36:02.363 --> 00:36:08.288]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[00:36:08.508 --> 00:36:09.649]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:25.219]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:29.582]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:36:33.604 --> 00:36:40.686]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:36:41.026 --> 00:36:46.687]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:36:46.888 --> 00:36:53.009]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[00:36:53.309 --> 00:36:57.050]  Check them out today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[00:37:03.351 --> 00:37:07.036]  A warning to viewers, the following images are disturbing.
[00:37:07.277 --> 00:37:18.131]  This all began after WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange released hundreds of thousands of secret documents detailing a backstabbing Clinton Foundation, but it now appears the real
[00:37:18.131 --> 00:37:27.941]  The real truth Assange was leading us to was hidden between the blurred lines of Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, John Podesta's, released emails.
[00:37:28.161 --> 00:37:37.150]  Fast forward past John Podesta's brother, Tony's, casual email exchange with Thelemic spirit cooking adherent, Marina Abramovic.
[00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:39.391]  Rosetta Stone was needed next.
[00:37:39.571 --> 00:37:51.255]  A verification that high-level Washington DC predatory pedophiles were using a code to communicate child sex trafficking as casually as ordering a pizza.
[00:37:51.415 --> 00:38:00.218]  An FBI unclassified document from WikiLeaks revealed symbols and logos used by pedophiles to identify sexual preferences.
[00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:16.054]  To include those who sexually abuse children, as well as those who produce, distribute, and trade child pornography, are using various types of identification logos or symbols to recognize one another and distinguish their sexual preferences.
[00:38:16.194 --> 00:38:22.380]  Investigators should also be attentive to pedophilia symbols advertised on websites.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:35.525]  During examinations of computer files, investigators should be conscious of subjects who try to conceal child pornography by labeling them with symbols instead of typical, suggestive, explicit names.
[00:38:35.865 --> 00:38:38.226]  Thus, the interest in code words.
[00:38:38.566 --> 00:38:39.586]  Now, clues.
[00:38:39.866 --> 00:38:41.807]  The menu from Comet Ping-Pong.
[00:38:42.027 --> 00:38:50.090]  Notice the symbol of the ping-pong paddles and its clever resemblance to the FBI document's symbol for child love.
[00:38:50.330 --> 00:39:08.404]  Alright, hang on New York Times, before you declare this fake news from your ivory tower, now look at the symbol for Besta Pizza, just two doors down from Comet Ping Pong Pizza, boldly using the symbol for Boy Lover as was recorded on the unclassified FBI document.
[00:39:08.624 --> 00:39:17.390]  The evidence begins to reveal that Besta Pizza and Comet Ping Pong Pizza may be competing for the lucrative Washington D.C.
[00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:19.711]  pedophile market right out in the open.
[00:39:19.871 --> 00:39:29.217]  Comet Ping Pong owner James Alefantis needs to explain himself, and so he did via the Hillary Clinton colluding New York Times.
[00:39:29.397 --> 00:39:32.439]  But so many questions remain unanswered.
[00:39:32.599 --> 00:39:37.983]  Why was this said by the band Heavy Breathing performing in Comet Ping Pong?
[00:39:38.083 --> 00:39:42.486]  He likes the world, sounds, tamales.
[00:39:43.846 --> 00:39:44.587]  And little boys.
[00:39:44.767 --> 00:39:45.447]  And children.
[00:39:45.527 --> 00:39:47.548]  I think that was his manager.
[00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.149]  No.
[00:39:50.854 --> 00:39:56.537]  We all have preferences.
[00:39:56.637 --> 00:40:05.021]  Why is the artwork adorning Comet Ping Pong's walls at the very least so insanely creepy, especially for a family restaurant?
[00:40:05.341 --> 00:40:10.484]  Why is Allophantus so close to Tony Podesta as revealed in the WikiLeaks emails?
[00:40:10.744 --> 00:40:14.266]  And why does Mr. Podesta collect questionable artwork
[00:40:14.606 --> 00:40:28.691]  Specializing in grotesque eroticism and pedophilic images, not to mention Podesta's dabbling in what appears to be cannibalistic rituals, while continuing his old friendship with convicted pedophile Dennis Hastert.
[00:40:28.891 --> 00:40:32.992]  Why is this man wearing an I Love Children shirt in this situation?
[00:40:33.232 --> 00:40:38.674]  Why did you write hashtag murder next to this incredibly creepy photo you posted?
[00:40:38.954 --> 00:40:42.476]  Why do you find it amusing that this baby is for sale?
[00:40:42.596 --> 00:40:45.038]  Why do you associate with this artist?
[00:40:45.318 --> 00:40:47.359]  Why is any of this okay?
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:59.267]  And if these code words are eventually proven to be just another method of communication, then why did the Podesta emails mention the code word pasta for either little boy or sex 78 times?
[00:41:00.868 --> 00:41:04.292]  Code word cheese for little girl 85 times.
[00:41:04.432 --> 00:41:09.218]  And what does Podesta's friend Herb mean by this statement from a Podesta email?
[00:41:09.358 --> 00:41:09.858]  P.S.
[00:41:10.259 --> 00:41:14.544]  Do you think I'll do better playing dominoes on cheese than on pasta?
[00:41:14.884 --> 00:41:19.129]  According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the FBI,
[00:41:20.951 --> 00:41:24.434]  460,699 children went missing in 2015.
[00:41:24.634 --> 00:41:25.395]  That we know of.
[00:41:25.535 --> 00:41:35.545]  Mr. Alephantis, this isn't a witch hunt, and it isn't an attack from fake news that your boyfriend David Brock, founder of Media Matters, would have us all ignore.
[00:41:35.785 --> 00:41:42.672]  Either you are the unlucky victim of a fake news onslaught due to your own poorly initiated publicity,
[00:41:43.072 --> 00:41:49.204]  Or a decades-old pedophile ring operating in the power-hoarding shadows of Washington, D.C.
[00:41:49.465 --> 00:41:52.030]  is about to be opened from your front door.
[00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:54.414]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:42:04.825]  Well as people are trying to get away for Thanksgiving, taking planes, trains and automobiles, let's take a look at this massive traffic jam in L.A.
[00:42:05.025 --> 00:42:08.827]  and what it tells us about the state of our infrastructure and where we're headed.
[00:42:09.327 --> 00:42:15.591]  The Telegraph of the United Kingdom asks, is this the world's worst traffic jam, this Thanksgiving gridlock?
[00:42:15.631 --> 00:42:17.612]  And as you look at the pictures that they've got here, there's a
[00:42:18.412 --> 00:42:24.637]  They tweet out, there's a tweet from ABC7 Eyewitness News, where they took a helicopter cam of the footage there.
[00:42:24.737 --> 00:42:31.002]  And basically, as Joe Jennings pointed out, LA has turned into a red state, as we see the motorists with the blues.
[00:42:31.042 --> 00:42:32.904]  That's the 405 in California.
[00:42:32.924 --> 00:42:35.266]  That's the only way you can get to the airport.
[00:42:35.826 --> 00:42:42.591]  Now, as you look at this massive traffic jam going both ways, you've got to ask yourself, is this a failed plan?
[00:42:43.332 --> 00:42:46.835]  Or have we got urban planners who are planning to fail?
[00:42:47.575 --> 00:42:48.516]  What could they do about that?
[00:42:48.816 --> 00:42:52.099]  We have urban planners who say, we can't widen the roads.
[00:42:52.259 --> 00:42:53.641]  It's urban sprawl as it is.
[00:42:53.681 --> 00:42:59.026]  We're turning all of our cities into just a massive concrete jungle for people.
[00:42:59.066 --> 00:43:03.009]  We've got the people on Twitter saying it looks like they're doing the mannequin challenge.
[00:43:03.309 --> 00:43:07.473]  Others saying maybe they're decorating the 405 with Christmas tree lights.
[00:43:07.493 --> 00:43:09.375]  Another one says it's called the 405 for a reason.
[00:43:09.395 --> 00:43:12.257]  It takes four or five hours to get anywhere.
[00:43:12.938 --> 00:43:13.619]  And why is that?
[00:43:13.999 --> 00:43:15.581]  Why couldn't we do something about that?
[00:43:15.621 --> 00:43:16.943]  And of course, we could do something about it.
[00:43:16.983 --> 00:43:18.104]  Think about cities.
[00:43:18.965 --> 00:43:22.689]  As cities got more heavily concentrated and compacted, what did they do?
[00:43:22.729 --> 00:43:29.317]  Did they keep building small buildings and widening the footprint of the cities in a more and more sprawl?
[00:43:29.557 --> 00:43:33.542]  They kind of did that in LA, but in most cities, they started to build skyscrapers.
[00:43:33.922 --> 00:43:36.925]  And we've seen that in some other cities like in Austin here.
[00:43:36.965 --> 00:43:44.213]  We've got an addition to a part of the interstate here where they just added another layer of the interstate over the existing roadbed.
[00:43:44.654 --> 00:43:50.080]  Things like that could be done if they wanted to help us with the traffic situation.
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:51.201]  But they don't.
[00:43:51.821 --> 00:43:53.663]  And I think a very clear indicator of this
[00:43:54.727 --> 00:43:55.267]  We're good to go.
[00:44:12.535 --> 00:44:19.202]  And you have to understand, when you go back and think about our history in this last hundred years or so, the history of the car, I think he got it exactly opposite.
[00:44:19.703 --> 00:44:21.465]  I think cities are the problem.
[00:44:22.025 --> 00:44:23.327]  Cities have always been the problem.
[00:44:23.887 --> 00:44:28.372]  Thomas Jefferson said, cities are a threat to the health, the wealth, and the liberty of man.
[00:44:28.452 --> 00:44:29.954]  Why are they a threat to the liberty of man?
[00:44:30.635 --> 00:44:33.958]  Because it's not just the traffic concentration of cars.
[00:44:34.739 --> 00:44:37.660]  It's the concentration of people into one area.
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.821]  And that's what the urban planners want.
[00:44:40.221 --> 00:44:41.541]  That's what the politicians want.
[00:44:41.841 --> 00:44:46.783]  That's what the people who run these services like Lyft and Uber, the car companies want that.
[00:44:47.183 --> 00:44:50.123]  They want you to be concentrated in one area.
[00:44:50.764 --> 00:44:56.025]  And we should start thinking about the concentration of control that that gives them over our lives.
[00:44:56.585 --> 00:45:01.667]  We should start thinking about the fact that as they plot to take away private car ownership,
[00:45:02.307 --> 00:45:05.188]  They're also plotting to turn us into renters.
[00:45:05.548 --> 00:45:09.050]  Not only renters of real estate, but renters even of our transportation.
[00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:14.212]  Where they will own the roads, they will own the cars, and we will have to rent everything from them.
[00:45:14.812 --> 00:45:15.953]  We've had many examples.
[00:45:15.973 --> 00:45:24.076]  We've had the CEO of Mercedes saying, I'm concerned about the future because I'm concerned that human drivers are going to bully the robot cars.
[00:45:24.696 --> 00:45:25.677]  Not the other way around, see?
[00:45:26.542 --> 00:45:36.604]  And what that tells you is the underlying understanding that they have, that they have talked about, that we cannot have a coexistence of human drivers with robot cars.
[00:45:36.664 --> 00:45:37.964]  You will have one or the other.
[00:45:37.984 --> 00:45:41.725]  It won't be the sort of thing where, oh, I'd like to just sit here on my daily commute and do this.
[00:45:41.845 --> 00:45:42.005]  No.
[00:45:42.385 --> 00:45:52.447]  They're going to gradually, and the only question is to what degree they will attempt to put human drivers out of the business and take over all the cars because they want to own everything.
[00:45:52.927 --> 00:45:56.269]  And he says, as he bemoans us, he says, we have a country that was built for cars.
[00:45:56.329 --> 00:46:01.393]  It's like, no, cars provided us a way to escape the concentration of the cities.
[00:46:01.893 --> 00:46:04.535]  That's why people took so eagerly to the suburbs.
[00:46:04.995 --> 00:46:07.737]  And the car was the instrument to get you out of there.
[00:46:08.197 --> 00:46:13.521]  But he goes on to say in this, he says, by 2025, private car ownership will all but end in major U.S.
[00:46:13.541 --> 00:46:13.862]  cities.
[00:46:14.262 --> 00:46:15.583]  Everything is going to be safer, right?
[00:46:15.643 --> 00:46:16.224]  They tell you that.
[00:46:16.904 --> 00:46:17.545]  Are we safer?
[00:46:17.605 --> 00:46:23.610]  Look at the many accidents that we've had with trains, with commuter trains, just in the last couple of years.
[00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:29.875]  These are very simple problems to solve compared to having robot cars, even if there are no human drivers on the road.
[00:46:30.495 --> 00:46:37.359]  We have a situation with trains where you've got one vehicle, it's on the track, all they have to do is make sure there's nothing in front of it and that it stops on time.
[00:46:37.399 --> 00:46:38.480]  They can't even do that.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.001]  Or think about airplanes.
[00:46:40.521 --> 00:46:43.043]  Are you going to have a wonderful life where you don't have any traffic?
[00:46:43.863 --> 00:46:48.746]  Those people who are headed to the airport, once they get to the airport, they've got a massive jam there.
[00:46:48.826 --> 00:46:50.467]  Now the problem is concentration.
[00:46:51.068 --> 00:46:57.852]  Cars, if urban planners wanted to do it, would be a way for us to lessen concentration, but they want control over your lives.
[00:47:02.978 --> 00:47:07.962]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.

[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.244 --> 00:48:52.725]  I don't know.
[00:49:08.387 --> 00:49:11.269]  Well, in our final segment tonight, we're going to be talking about the southern border.
[00:49:11.309 --> 00:49:19.174]  We have an in-house resident expert, Joe Biggs, reporter for InfoWars, that has been to the southern border, and we have some really troubling information for you.
[00:49:19.194 --> 00:49:29.360]  It turns out, not only are people exploiting our border coming across illegally, but it looks like we have an additional threat, a 9-11 mastermind, an Al-Qaeda mastermind.
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.102]  He favors our immigration open border policy.
[00:49:32.522 --> 00:49:33.643]  Big surprise there, Joe.
[00:49:33.683 --> 00:49:37.225]  I know you have some more information regarding this, a piece that came out in the Washington Examiner.
[00:49:37.705 --> 00:49:38.526]  Let us know what you found.
[00:49:55.058 --> 00:50:02.702]  And basically what this book is that he has written, James Mitchell, breaks down how enhanced interrogations have worked.
[00:50:03.383 --> 00:50:11.047]  And this is coming from the mouths of actual individuals who've been held there for years saying, hey, you know, this stuff, it actually works.
[00:50:11.067 --> 00:50:16.870]  Like, you know, I normally wouldn't have said half the things I've done and it's led to, you know, a lot of things being stopped.
[00:50:17.310 --> 00:50:33.497]  It says the jailed architect of 9-11 revealed that Al Qaeda's plan to kill the United States was not through military attacks, but by immigration and outbreeding non-Muslims who would use a legal system to install Sharia law, according to a blockbuster new book.
[00:50:33.897 --> 00:50:37.518]  Now, we've talked about this time and time again, how the borders are completely and totally wide open.
[00:50:37.898 --> 00:50:42.520]  Just the other day, Barack Obama suspended drone use at the borders, and we'll get to that part.
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:45.161]  But I've been out on the border numerous times.
[00:50:45.261 --> 00:50:48.102]  We already have a wall in some areas, and some areas we don't.
[00:50:48.362 --> 00:50:59.606]  Some areas, the wall consists of merely just wooden posts with maybe a strand of barbed wire that really is nothing, and it's so easy to penetrate and to get through.
[00:51:00.066 --> 00:51:08.669]  Joe, what does that say to you, that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, you know, a known terrorist, he's saying, you know, look, our weak-kneed politicians, they're going to come after waterboarding.
[00:51:08.889 --> 00:51:10.769]  And nobody likes the thought of waterboarding.
[00:51:10.789 --> 00:51:12.350]  You know, it's disgusting and despicable.
[00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:14.931]  They're doing this to people that have, you know...
[00:51:15.931 --> 00:51:17.893]  Not so veiled threats against the U.S.
[00:51:17.913 --> 00:51:21.176]  that are involved in terrorist activities that want to see our country destroyed.
[00:51:21.496 --> 00:51:27.521]  And oh, by the way, our southern border, they see that as a prime opportunity just come on through because it's wide open.
[00:51:27.901 --> 00:51:30.363]  Meanwhile, Trump is called a racist and a bigot.
[00:51:30.664 --> 00:51:34.407]  He's not compassionate because he wants to close the border and secure law and order.
[00:51:34.847 --> 00:51:35.207]  We're good
[00:51:57.097 --> 00:52:00.178]  Across the world, they're saying, look, there's a prime opportunity here.
[00:52:00.519 --> 00:52:04.520]  You can go right up on up through Central America, across the southern border into the U.S.
[00:52:04.921 --> 00:52:06.461]  You're going to go largely undetected.
[00:52:06.501 --> 00:52:07.922]  We've had that S-2 route.
[00:52:08.242 --> 00:52:11.643]  Border agents were actually told to stand down as of October 1st.
[00:52:11.663 --> 00:52:13.204]  They're not even patrolling it anymore.
[00:52:13.524 --> 00:52:15.085]  That's a known route for smugglers.
[00:52:15.125 --> 00:52:17.886]  And you brought us another article coming out of Breitbart, Texas.
[00:52:18.446 --> 00:52:21.748]  Breitbart, Texas leaders demand restart for aerial border surveillance.
[00:52:22.048 --> 00:52:24.489]  You touched on this a second ago, the drone aspect.
[00:52:24.789 --> 00:52:26.270]  The president has canceled
[00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:27.970]  The drone's on the border.
[00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:29.851]  We don't want anybody looking at that border.
[00:52:29.951 --> 00:52:32.452]  Why do you think he's so anti-American?
[00:52:33.112 --> 00:52:33.452]  I don't know.
[00:52:33.492 --> 00:52:35.912]  I mean, you can clearly see that the stuff works, you know.
[00:52:36.313 --> 00:52:40.454]  Like I've said time and time again, I was in the border in Arizona and I spent some time out there.
[00:52:40.474 --> 00:52:47.275]  It's an area called Hereford and there is a big wall in that one area, but there's many areas where it breaks and it's very easy to get across.
[00:52:47.595 --> 00:52:53.457]  Now just on the other side in Mexico are cartel houses and things like that that can be seen from this guy Glenn Spencer's backyard.
[00:52:53.897 --> 00:53:16.505]  And he has this system that he's created where he uses seismic readers that go in the ground, and whenever someone walks and gets close to the border, it actually sets off these autonomous drones and then gives real-time footage back to his command center, and then he can call Border Patrol and police and say, hey man, there's drugs coming across, there's human smuggling, there's terrorists, they're armed, they're not armed, and it works.
[00:53:16.585 --> 00:53:17.905]  It's something that's very effective.
[00:53:18.285 --> 00:53:22.927]  And that's why it's important to read this stuff, because I'm going to give you some more quotes from this guy.
[00:53:23.507 --> 00:53:31.351]  It says the book that's set for release next Tuesday from Crown Forum show that Muslim terror groups had a much bigger plan to crush America than just through attacks like 9-11.
[00:53:31.571 --> 00:53:40.795]  Instead, the plan is to fill the country with like-minded Muslims through the country's easy immigration laws and by having babies, and then using the U.S.
[00:53:40.875 --> 00:53:44.817]  legal and welfare system to turn the country into a system like Iran.
[00:53:45.297 --> 00:53:47.999]  Now the terrorists, he said, the terror attacks were good.
[00:53:48.519 --> 00:53:54.167]  But the practical way to defeat America was through immigration and by outbreeding non-Muslims.
[00:53:54.508 --> 00:54:02.138]  He said jihadi-minded brothers would immigrate into the U.S., taking advantage of the welfare system to support themselves while they spread their jihadi message.
[00:54:02.459 --> 00:54:05.163]  They will wrap themselves in America's rights and laws for protection.
[00:54:05.623 --> 00:54:12.370]  Ratchet up acceptance of Sharia law and then only when they are strong enough rise up and violently impose Sharia from within.
[00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:22.140]  He said the brothers would relentlessly continue their attacks and the American people would eventually become so tired, so frightened, and so weary of war that they would just want it to end.
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:26.164]  And eventually America will expose her neck for us to slaughter.
[00:54:27.492 --> 00:54:30.034]  And these are the kind of people that we have to worry about.
[00:54:30.314 --> 00:54:40.602]  That's why when we talked about the Paris attacks, when I went out to Paris with Michael Zimmerman and I went into Belgium, the way that these guys were getting across over in Europe were these open borders.
[00:54:40.782 --> 00:54:49.529]  And they use it and they use this refugee crisis as a way to be able to skate in and slip in through the cracks and then go out and carry these attacks.
[00:54:49.909 --> 00:54:52.491]  You know, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.
[00:54:52.811 --> 00:55:02.175]  And we've seen how wide open borders can lead to death, how it can lead to chaos, how it can lead to your entire civilization collapsing, and that's what's happening over in Europe.
[00:55:02.195 --> 00:55:03.536]  So why would we not sit here?
[00:55:03.796 --> 00:55:06.977]  Why would we not look at that and learn from that and go, you know what?
[00:55:07.257 --> 00:55:08.278]  Let's not make that mistake.
[00:55:08.478 --> 00:55:09.398]  Let's secure the borders.
[00:55:09.578 --> 00:55:10.819]  Let's vet who's coming across.
[00:55:10.879 --> 00:55:15.921]  Not only that, but tackling this issue where we have non-citizens taking advantage of our welfare state.
[00:55:16.941 --> 00:55:19.042]  This is something that we've talked about here on InfoWars.
[00:55:19.462 --> 00:55:20.783]  Alex has covered it in depth.
[00:55:20.843 --> 00:55:24.444]  I know that you have a heart for this issue as well because we don't want to see our country fall.
[00:55:25.064 --> 00:55:26.185]  We like our values.
[00:55:26.245 --> 00:55:27.565]  We like our American system.
[00:55:27.605 --> 00:55:29.346]  We like our principles.
[00:55:29.386 --> 00:55:31.407]  We like being able to have free speech in this nation.
[00:55:31.487 --> 00:55:34.808]  We don't want Sharia law imposed on our people here.
[00:55:35.268 --> 00:55:40.053]  And the fact that you have an open leader saying, this is how we're going to defeat them and conquer them.
[00:55:40.353 --> 00:55:46.759]  We're just going to make sure that all of these non-citizens are going to secure rights, the same rights that citizens have, and they're going to begin mass breeding.
[00:55:46.779 --> 00:55:48.881]  We're going to outbreed a population.
[00:55:48.921 --> 00:55:50.162]  Doesn't that alarm you?
[00:55:50.222 --> 00:55:51.103]  It's like, what?
[00:55:51.663 --> 00:55:51.904]  What?
[00:55:52.489 --> 00:56:04.340]  I mean the guy Khalid Mohammed smiled and said the media, either on purpose or without realizing it, would promote Islam's cause and champion tearing down the measures put in place to protect the American people after 9-11.
[00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:08.744]  He said the media would promote al-Qaeda's cause by framing the war against Islam
[00:56:09.324 --> 00:56:16.009]  His characterization, not mine, and that's the guy who wrote the book, as morally wrong, impossible to win, and fraught with unacceptable losses.
[00:56:16.089 --> 00:56:26.337]  He said the media's response was one of Allah's gifts, one of the ways Allah preordained for Americans to set aside those things which kept us safe and prevented attacks in the immediate aftermath of 9-11.
[00:56:26.877 --> 00:56:33.282]  So here he is bragging, he knows that we're gonna be empathetic, we have these big hearts, we're gonna go like, oh my god, you know, these poor immigrants,
[00:56:33.462 --> 00:56:37.524]  Soros called the Catholics useful idiots when it comes to this because of their compassion.
[00:56:37.584 --> 00:56:39.605]  That's a very known thing.
[00:56:39.626 --> 00:56:40.546]  These are smart people.
[00:56:40.586 --> 00:56:41.306]  They understand.
[00:56:41.747 --> 00:56:43.888]  They don't just live in caves like a lot of people think.
[00:56:43.908 --> 00:56:49.611]  They're not just sitting out there, you know, milking goats and screaming Allah Akbar all day.
[00:56:49.631 --> 00:56:52.053]  These guys, no combat, no war.
[00:56:52.093 --> 00:56:56.975]  They are masters of their trade and that is manipulating people.
[00:56:57.255 --> 00:57:01.698]  If you go to places like Iraq and Afghanistan, it's part of their culture to lie to non-believers.
[00:57:01.938 --> 00:57:10.027]  It is okay to lie to non-believers so they will tell you whatever it is you want to hear just so they can at the end get their way and have it.
[00:57:10.438 --> 00:57:14.260]  Look, this is not an assault for me on Muslims at all.
[00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:29.489]  This is an assault on Sharia law being implemented in this country and we have a playbook by this author if this is how this is going to work here and for people to just idly sit by the fact that they call the mainstream media one of Allah's greatest gifts to them.
[00:57:29.509 --> 00:57:36.353]  You know, we've got a mainstream media in this country that lies to us, that bullies us, that wants us to believe that if we speak out
[00:57:36.813 --> 00:57:37.393]  We're good.
[00:57:58.021 --> 00:58:03.847]  You know, it is time to dethrone these people, to defang them because of what they've done to our society.
[00:58:03.867 --> 00:58:06.590]  They're aiding people who want to destroy us.
[00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:10.655]  If that is not crystal clear by now, we haven't done our jobs, frankly.
[00:58:11.368 --> 00:58:12.169]  Yeah, it's pretty scary.
[00:58:12.189 --> 00:58:13.150]  I mean, it's all right here.
[00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:21.838]  I mean, here you have it from a guy who's led people, a guy who's a known terrorist, and he's saying that he's going to use our weaknesses completely and totally against us.
[00:58:21.878 --> 00:58:34.550]  He's going to do everything he can to train his brothers to exploit our open borders, to tug at our heartstrings, and know that we're going to have these social justice warriors who are going to stand up and fight for them, and in the end, be the death of them.
[00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:35.210]  Exactly.
[00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:35.791]  Well, you know what?
[00:58:35.831 --> 00:58:37.332]  We could talk about this all day long.
[00:58:37.372 --> 00:58:38.493]  It's of critical importance to you.
[00:58:38.573 --> 00:58:40.174]  Check out this segment.
[00:58:40.214 --> 00:58:41.255]  It'll be up on YouTube soon.
[00:58:41.275 --> 00:58:42.756]  That's going to do it for us for tonight.
[00:58:42.936 --> 00:58:45.899]  Also, be sure to tune in to InfoWars Nightly News on Monday.
[00:58:45.979 --> 00:58:47.440]  David Knight will be hosting.
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:49.442]  We have a happy Thanksgiving for you.
[00:58:49.502 --> 00:58:50.823]  Happy Thanksgiving for our audience.
[00:58:50.863 --> 00:58:51.543]  We love you.
[00:58:51.623 --> 00:58:52.264]  Stay strong.
[00:58:52.364 --> 00:58:53.545]  You are the resistance.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.930]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:20.115]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.435 --> 00:59:24.176]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.737 --> 00:59:27.578]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.779 --> 00:59:36.003]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.323 --> 00:59:38.604]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:39.265 --> 00:59:41.706]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.

[00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:54.693]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
