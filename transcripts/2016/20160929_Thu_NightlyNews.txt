[00:00:20.208 --> 00:00:22.734]  It's Thursday, September 29th, 2016.
[00:00:23.335 --> 00:00:28.467]  I'm Owen Schroer from InfoWars.com and this is what to expect on tonight's nightly news.
[00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:41.395]  Tonight, Obama holds a town hall after his veto of the 9-11 victims bill, where he tried to throw American victims under the Saudi bus.
[00:00:41.876 --> 00:00:49.805]  We look at how he spends it, and as a bonus, the Muslim apologist-in-chief explains why he won't say Islamic terrorism.
[00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.767]  An issue that has been sort of manufactured.
[00:00:56.047 --> 00:00:56.307]  Then?
[00:00:56.887 --> 00:00:57.507]  Folder guy?
[00:00:58.047 --> 00:00:59.587]  Poker player hand signals?
[00:00:59.927 --> 00:01:03.828]  Did Hillary use hand signals to coordinate with the debate moderator, Lester Holt?
[00:01:04.468 --> 00:01:07.009]  And what is Hillary's concealed carry?
[00:01:07.949 --> 00:01:17.311]  And we look at a network of Clinton money laundering super PACs and non-profits and the man who runs them for her, David Brock of Media Matters.
[00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:20.732]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.041]  Look, I'm not going to sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:36.303]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[00:01:36.323 --> 00:01:37.424]  Because it's already here.
[00:01:37.824 --> 00:01:38.464]  It's being announced.
[00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:42.307]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:44.048]  You don't let them break your will.
[00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:56.757]  Go to infowars.com forward slash app and download an app that took us over a year to develop that we're going to be expanding on the next few months with free video and audio and podcast feeds and breaking news and alerts and so much more.
[00:01:57.037 --> 00:01:59.979]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:01.120]  Take action!
[00:02:04.822 --> 00:02:06.723]  I train two, three times a day.
[00:02:07.503 --> 00:02:11.806]  They're brutal, agonizing, painful training sessions.
[00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:18.190]  I have to have the edge over my opponents.
[00:02:19.031 --> 00:02:24.094]  I believe that InfoWars products, Super Male Vitality, you know, that gives me the edge.
[00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:27.056]  Well, you have to know where you break.
[00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:30.740]  You know, ultimately, like, you don't push yourself to know where that breaking point is.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.422]  You're always going to be falling short of what your potential is.
[00:02:33.923 --> 00:02:39.609]  So it's really just about finding how far you can go.
[00:02:56.613 --> 00:02:57.880]  There's a lot of different things out there.
[00:02:58.985 --> 00:02:59.890]  I only use the best.
[00:03:01.587 --> 00:03:10.650]  Welcome into the Nightly News, I'm Owen Schroer from InfoWars.com and tonight we kick off with a response to Barack Obama's town hall last night.
[00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:24.896]  Now, I expected this town hall to be completely purposed in attacking Donald Trump, trying to make Donald Trump the bad guy, finding whatever angle they could to try to steer CNN voters away from Donald Trump.
[00:03:24.936 --> 00:03:30.418]  Now, it did not end up being that type of a town hall with President Obama last night.
[00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:36.162]  I don't want to, in any way, sugar coat the fact that there have been significant problems in the VA that have accumulated over decades.
[00:03:52.014 --> 00:04:01.599]  So there's Barack Obama admitting that the VA has major issues, and then he talks about how these issues have been building up over decades.
[00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:16.947]  Well, you know, my problem with this Barack Obama is that it's your administration and it's your policies that have put the needs of individuals who come to this country illegally ahead of the needs of veterans.
[00:04:17.327 --> 00:04:20.370]  Now, we've got all kinds of case studies that can prove this.
[00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:30.179]  In fact, we know that people who come here illegally as refugees get a bigger stipend from the government than veterans do.
[00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:40.269]  So if Barack Obama is going to sit here and admit that there's major problems in the VA, he better look himself right in the mirror and admit that his policies are partially responsible.
[00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:41.330]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:04:42.062 --> 00:04:47.285]  Honoring our flag and our anthem is part of what binds us together as a nation.
[00:04:48.465 --> 00:04:49.205]  Now this was great.
[00:04:49.225 --> 00:05:01.712]  He was asked about the Colin Kaepernick kneel and the NFL players kneeling and we'll have more from him on those but he just admitted right there that this is a divisive tactic.
[00:05:02.372 --> 00:05:06.354]  He just admitted that it's the national anthem that brings Americans together
[00:05:07.154 --> 00:05:14.580]  And it's something that is an honorary tradition here, especially before sporting events or any event, that brings us together.
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.024]  For that moment we all stand united as part of this union.
[00:05:20.244 --> 00:05:28.270]  So he admits that Colin Kaepernick's taking a knee, or any athlete, we've also seen Megan Rapinoe from the United States soccer team take a knee.
[00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.093]  So there's President Obama admitting that that is a divisive tactic.
[00:05:32.253 --> 00:05:33.093]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:05:33.774 --> 00:05:36.156]  Part of what makes this country special
[00:05:37.702 --> 00:05:43.761]  is that we respect people's rights to have a different opinion.
[00:05:45.578 --> 00:05:57.143]  That's funny that that would come out of the lips of Barack Obama when it's his liberal media, it's his liberal sheep following that wants to silence all conservative outlets, that wants to shut us up.
[00:05:57.423 --> 00:06:04.486]  We even have reports coming up later tonight of Donald Trump supporters getting beat up at rallies because they're wearing a Trump hat.
[00:06:04.526 --> 00:06:09.589]  So this is completely hypocritical of anyone of the left to say, and it gets even more hypocritical.
[00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:10.389]  Let's roll the next one.
[00:06:11.727 --> 00:06:17.610]  We fight sometimes so that people can do things that we disagree with.
[00:06:18.871 --> 00:06:20.832]  And I want everybody to listen to each other.
[00:06:22.553 --> 00:06:23.794]  Really, Barack Obama?
[00:06:23.834 --> 00:06:25.555]  You want everyone to listen to each other?
[00:06:25.815 --> 00:06:29.257]  You're fighting for my right to free speech to speak out against you?
[00:06:29.457 --> 00:06:30.858]  To speak out against Hillary Clinton?
[00:06:31.158 --> 00:06:34.260]  And then he says he wants everybody to listen to each other.
[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.641]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:06:36.701 --> 00:06:38.042]  Unfortunately, you've grown up.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:47.466]  Hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[00:06:49.187 --> 00:06:51.950]  Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works.
[00:06:53.491 --> 00:06:56.173]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[00:06:58.815 --> 00:06:59.896]  You should reject these voices.
[00:07:01.408 --> 00:07:01.608]  What?
[00:07:02.028 --> 00:07:03.309]  Reject these voices?
[00:07:03.429 --> 00:07:04.590]  Wait a second, Barack.
[00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.751]  You just said you want everyone to communicate.
[00:07:06.791 --> 00:07:08.772]  You just said you want everyone to hear one another.
[00:07:09.212 --> 00:07:23.501]  Oh, but that was him just a few years ago at a commencement speech telling you to ignore voices that are the conservatives, that are Infowars.com, that are Michael Savage, warning you about government tyranny, warning you about government corruption, which includes him.
[00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:25.582]  He wants to silence those voices.
[00:07:25.622 --> 00:07:27.243]  He wants you to ignore those voices.
[00:07:27.583 --> 00:07:28.964]  But here he is last night saying,
[00:07:29.304 --> 00:07:31.105]  He wants everyone to listen to everyone.
[00:07:31.425 --> 00:07:33.567]  This is a perfect example of the left.
[00:07:33.927 --> 00:07:38.270]  They want you to listen to everyone when everyone shares the same viewpoint as them.
[00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:42.773]  But if somebody has a different viewpoint, they want to silence you and they want those voices to be ignored.
[00:07:43.513 --> 00:07:48.776]  I love when Barack Obama gives us the perfect opportunity to show how he is a complete hypocrite.
[00:07:48.796 --> 00:07:49.637]  Let's roll the next one.
[00:07:50.397 --> 00:07:57.382]  What I have been careful about when I describe these issues is to make sure that we do not
[00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:10.454]  Lump these murderers into the billion Muslims that exist around the world, including in this country.
[00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.591]  Yeah, he wants to be careful about that, folks.
[00:08:13.631 --> 00:08:20.134]  He wants to be careful about not lumping people into one group, even though Hillary Clinton did that with Donald Trump supporters.
[00:08:20.174 --> 00:08:22.835]  I would even say that he's done that with Donald Trump supporters.
[00:08:23.095 --> 00:08:24.636]  He's done that with police officers.
[00:08:24.856 --> 00:08:26.037]  He's done that with white people.
[00:08:26.137 --> 00:08:29.479]  Again, more total hypocrisy out of this man's mouth.
[00:08:29.719 --> 00:08:31.980]  Now, the amazing thing is the question was addressed
[00:08:32.932 --> 00:08:36.295]  As a Christian, I'm not going to let them claim my religion and say you're killing for Christ.
[00:08:36.635 --> 00:08:37.456]  I would say that's ridiculous.
[00:08:58.203 --> 00:09:00.531]  That's not what my religion stands for.
[00:09:01.313 --> 00:09:03.601]  Call these folks what they are, which is killers and terrorists.
[00:09:04.963 --> 00:09:06.304]  Now, here's the thing about that.
[00:09:06.965 --> 00:09:08.606]  They're also Muslims.
[00:09:09.287 --> 00:09:09.587]  Okay?
[00:09:10.168 --> 00:09:12.630]  So, I understand what Barack Obama is saying.
[00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:26.923]  If I'm a Christian, and there's people going around chopping people's heads off, stabbing people, shooting up nightclubs, blowing bombs up, homemade bombs all over these cities, and they claim to be doing this in the name of Jesus, and I'm a Christian, I would say, that's not my religion.
[00:09:27.063 --> 00:09:28.344]  Don't let me in with those people.
[00:09:28.404 --> 00:09:30.326]  However, I wouldn't be offended if you said,
[00:09:30.646 --> 00:09:31.587]  Radical Christians.
[00:09:31.827 --> 00:09:33.488]  But here's the difference, Barack Obama.
[00:09:33.869 --> 00:09:35.690]  That's not happening.
[00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:46.038]  We have case after case after case of people saying Allah Akbar and then going out and committing atrocities, going out and committing terrorist attacks.
[00:09:47.179 --> 00:09:49.419]  Again, he refuses to say radical Islamic terror.
[00:09:49.719 --> 00:09:52.900]  He stands up for the religion of Islam, which that's perfectly fine.
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.441]  You have the right to whatever religion you want in this country, but let's not be fooled.
[00:09:56.641 --> 00:10:00.441]  These are radical Islamic terrorists who are terrorizing this country now.
[00:10:00.641 --> 00:10:01.601]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:10:02.862 --> 00:10:13.804]  The dangers where we get loose in this language, particularly when a president, or people aspiring to become president, get loose with this language.
[00:10:14.284 --> 00:10:15.944]  You can see in some of the language that we've
[00:10:16.854 --> 00:10:17.874]  Does anyone buy that?
[00:10:35.518 --> 00:10:36.499]  Is anyone buying that?
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.566]  He clearly goes right after Donald Trump and his policies.
[00:10:42.087 --> 00:10:47.174]  Jake Tapper shockingly with that hideous tie calls him out on it and then he denies it!
[00:10:48.826 --> 00:10:51.488]  I tell you, the boldness of this guy is simply stunning.
[00:10:51.828 --> 00:10:56.371]  He literally goes like, quote for quote, trying to attack Donald Trump on his immigration policies.
[00:10:56.692 --> 00:10:58.373]  Jake Tapper's hideous tie calls him out.
[00:10:58.393 --> 00:11:00.154]  He says, I wasn't talking about Donald Trump.
[00:11:00.274 --> 00:11:00.995]  Oh, of course not.
[00:11:01.055 --> 00:11:02.075]  No, I don't want to get into this.
[00:11:02.476 --> 00:11:04.057]  What an absolute bold-faced liar.
[00:11:04.077 --> 00:11:04.897]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:11:05.338 --> 00:11:07.459]  This is going to be a challenge that we have for a while.
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:16.466]  It is possible for individuals or small groups of people
[00:11:17.591 --> 00:11:17.691]  To
[00:11:32.571 --> 00:11:41.597]  So he just basically told you that you just need to be prepared and you need to accept lone wolf terrorism coming to America and there's just nothing they can do about it.
[00:11:41.717 --> 00:11:42.438]  It's just organic.
[00:11:42.498 --> 00:11:44.079]  It's homegrown now and there's nothing you can do.
[00:11:44.379 --> 00:11:49.343]  He even says that these events are being inspired, but he won't say radical Islamic terrorism.
[00:11:49.643 --> 00:11:53.286]  Again, I don't see the Bible inspiring people to go kill people.
[00:11:53.346 --> 00:11:54.687]  I don't see, you know,
[00:11:55.532 --> 00:12:02.434]  Priests and cardinals and bishops inspiring people to go commit acts of terror, but we're seeing this in the religion of Islam.
[00:12:02.474 --> 00:12:04.014]  This is just a fact, Barack Obama.
[00:12:04.314 --> 00:12:07.055]  I don't know what rock you're living under, but it must be pretty cozy under there.
[00:12:07.335 --> 00:12:08.235]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:12:09.236 --> 00:12:18.218]  If you look worldwide, the number of terrorist incidents have not substantially increased.
[00:12:20.307 --> 00:12:22.449]  Well, how about if we just look in America?
[00:12:23.069 --> 00:12:24.891]  How about if we just decided to look in America?
[00:12:24.931 --> 00:12:29.715]  I know that this is not something Obama likes to do, but, you know, here at InfoWars, we like to look at America.
[00:12:29.755 --> 00:12:30.516]  We're Americans.
[00:12:30.876 --> 00:12:35.560]  And in America, under your administration, terrorist attacks are now becoming the norm.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.202]  In fact, it's so bad now, folks,
[00:12:37.822 --> 00:12:40.584]  You can't even keep up with all of these terrorist attacks.
[00:12:40.604 --> 00:12:41.444]  They happen so much.
[00:12:41.744 --> 00:12:42.805]  I mean, it is really sad.
[00:12:42.865 --> 00:12:47.068]  So, Obama wants to sit here and act like the world is a more peaceful place, but look within.
[00:12:47.148 --> 00:12:48.268]  Look domestically, folks.
[00:12:48.348 --> 00:12:57.634]  It is without a doubt, terrorism is striking this country at a much greater ratio than it was before Barack Obama was president, at least in the number of events.
[00:12:57.974 --> 00:12:58.895]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:13:00.365 --> 00:13:01.526]  I don't think so.
[00:13:14.966 --> 00:13:37.531]  So now Barack Obama is, to me, he's basically making a battle cry for all of these terrorists who want to come here and do just that, and then he wants to blame guns, and of course the ultimate irony is, and this is why he says that they can get away with it, if there were good citizens there with a gun, they would stop the radical terrorist with a gun immediately, and how many people died would be minimalized.
[00:13:37.591 --> 00:13:39.592]  But he doesn't want that, he only wants to have guns himself.
[00:13:39.832 --> 00:13:40.732]  Let's roll to the last one.
[00:13:41.718 --> 00:14:05.977]  What this legislation did was it said if a private citizen believes that, having been victimized by terrorism, that another country didn't do enough to stop one of its citizens, for example, in engaging in terrorism, then they can file a personal lawsuit, a private lawsuit in court.
[00:14:09.585 --> 00:14:30.579]  The problem with that is that if we eliminate this notion of sovereign immunity, then our men and women in uniform around the world could potentially start seeing ourselves subject to reciprocal loss.
[00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:36.563]  Did Barack Obama just admit that the United States allows terrorists to operate in this country?
[00:14:36.883 --> 00:14:37.844]  That's what it sounds like.
[00:14:38.902 --> 00:14:44.006]  We will start by reducing premiums by as much as $2,500 per family.
[00:14:44.366 --> 00:14:50.892]  A system where we're going to work with your employers to lower your premiums by up to $2,500 per family per year.
[00:14:51.092 --> 00:14:59.138]  Here's what change is saying to people who already have health insurance and the employers who are providing it, we'll work to lower your premiums by up to $2,500 per family per year.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:06.041]  I also have a health care plan that would save the average family $2,500 on their premiums.
[00:15:06.901 --> 00:15:14.363]  And if you already have health care, then we're going to reduce costs an average of $2,500 per family on premiums.
[00:15:14.663 --> 00:15:19.004]  It's time to bring down the typical family premium by $2,500.
[00:15:19.504 --> 00:15:21.965]  It's time to bring down the costs for the entire country.
[00:15:22.185 --> 00:15:26.067]  And we'll cut the cost of a typical family's health care by up to $2,500 per year.
[00:15:26.087 --> 00:15:34.530]  Well, internet pioneer Matt Drudge created a firestorm over the weekend tweeting, just paid the Obamacare penalty for not getting covered.
[00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.531]  I'm calling it a liberty tax.
[00:15:36.611 --> 00:15:41.473]  But a White House representative firing back tweeting, flat lie, no fee for previous years.
[00:15:41.513 --> 00:15:43.134]  Scary how much influence he once had.
[00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:55.382]  The Obama administration and the liberal media have told us again and again and again that there is no individual mandate that requires us to buy health insurance.
[00:15:55.722 --> 00:15:57.943]  If you don't want it, you don't have to buy it, right?
[00:15:58.123 --> 00:16:03.367]  But when tax season comes around, you better be ready to pay the price big time.
[00:16:03.447 --> 00:16:09.771]  And that's because if you don't have health insurance, there is a stiff penalty.
[00:16:10.051 --> 00:16:14.372]  Americans who don't buy health care coverage will face a heftier fine in 2016.
[00:16:14.472 --> 00:16:20.114]  There are 10.5 million uninsured Americans eligible for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
[00:16:20.494 --> 00:16:28.256]  But the Obama administration expects only a quarter will sign up this year, even though those that don't could pay a higher penalty in their taxes.
[00:16:28.276 --> 00:16:29.236]  That's almost a 50% jump.
[00:16:30.256 --> 00:16:30.616]  I don't know.
[00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:59.419]  Now, new data from the IRS reveals that in 2014, over 8 million Americans paid a staggering $1.7 billion in Obamacare penalties.
[00:16:59.739 --> 00:17:07.802]  And we know that that number is expected to be even higher, much higher, in 2015, 2016, and beyond.
[00:17:08.143 --> 00:17:09.263]  So let me get this straight.
[00:17:09.463 --> 00:17:13.325]  Obamacare was passed because people couldn't afford health insurance.
[00:17:13.925 --> 00:17:21.467]  But now, because of Obamacare, people are being heavily fined because they can't afford health insurance.
[00:17:21.767 --> 00:17:26.148]  Premiums are up and some people have decided they're not so affordable.
[00:17:26.428 --> 00:17:28.148]  Premiums have also increased.
[00:17:28.488 --> 00:17:30.949]  The cost of a mid-level plan is up an average of 7.5%.
[00:17:31.869 --> 00:17:36.510]  It's due in part because a number of companies have left the marketplace.
[00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.071]  Fewer insurers means less competition.
[00:17:39.631 --> 00:17:42.793]  No, I actually didn't know the penalty was that high.
[00:17:42.873 --> 00:17:50.277]  And if you own a business, chances are you too are getting effed over by Obamacare.
[00:17:50.337 --> 00:17:57.641]  First, the employer mandate, as you mentioned, kicks in for companies with 100 or more people and some of them are going to decide this may not be worth the cost.
[00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:06.064]  But even those with 50 to 99 people are going to have to make very detailed monthly statements in terms of getting ready for this thing.
[00:18:06.424 --> 00:18:09.825]  And companies with under 50 people are going to have some surprises.
[00:18:10.185 --> 00:18:14.527]  For example, if you own two small businesses, the federal government combines those.
[00:18:14.587 --> 00:18:18.108]  So you may be picked up by this, even if you don't realize it yet.
[00:18:18.428 --> 00:18:24.530]  However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and his name is Donald Trump.
[00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:30.751]  And his plan for health care reform is easily accessible on his website, DonaldTrump.com.
[00:18:31.071 --> 00:18:34.432]  It's all laid out in plain English for everyone to see.
[00:18:35.132 --> 00:18:48.235]  Economic and financial experts agree that it is, well, it's a rock-solid plan to repeal the incredible economic burden of Obamacare once and for all.
[00:18:48.715 --> 00:18:50.095]  What's your plan for Obamacare?
[00:18:50.595 --> 00:18:52.879]  Obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced.

[00:23:06.932 --> 00:23:09.593]  Major news happening on the health front this month.
[00:23:10.073 --> 00:23:11.774]  One particular story stands out.
[00:23:12.114 --> 00:23:16.256]  Bayer bought Monsanto for $66 billion this month.
[00:23:16.576 --> 00:23:23.778]  Now this is the largest corporate cash buyout in history, and it is a huge step in the direction of controlling the world's food supply.
[00:23:24.119 --> 00:23:31.321]  So now you're thinking you're merging GMOs, pesticides, and pharmaceutical drugs, as well as crop seeds.
[00:23:31.521 --> 00:23:35.283]  This has huge implications because now we're seeing these huge corporate giants
[00:23:35.763 --> 00:23:36.344]  I think so.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:05.694]  Pesticide manufacturers' own tests reveal that there has been serious harm to honeybees from their own products, but they're not releasing this information to the public.
[00:24:05.974 --> 00:24:08.017]  So this is unpublished field trials.
[00:24:08.077 --> 00:24:13.224]  The research was conducted by Syngenta and Bayer on their neonicotinoid insecticides.
[00:24:13.584 --> 00:24:18.568]  And they were obtained recently by Greenpeace after a freedom of information request.
[00:24:18.968 --> 00:24:30.396]  Now this is key because neonicotinoids are the world's most widely used insecticide and there is clear scientific evidence that they do cause harm to honeybees at the levels found in fields.
[00:24:30.736 --> 00:24:35.059]  But there hasn't really been any evidence that they can cause harm to the entire colony.
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.702]  This new research reveals that Syngenta and Bayers
[00:24:39.182 --> 00:24:43.726]  Some of their neonicotinoids can actually seriously harm the colony at high doses.
[00:24:44.147 --> 00:24:51.033]  They didn't find any significant effects below concentrations of 50 parts per billion or 40 parts per billion respectively.
[00:24:51.534 --> 00:25:01.603]  So this is why they're saying, you know, it's we don't really need to release this information out to the public because usually in fields the concentrations are below 10 parts per billion.
[00:25:02.003 --> 00:25:04.345]  But a lot of people are pushing back against that saying,
[00:25:05.566 --> 00:25:09.728]  There is so much debate surrounding these insecticides and these neonicotinoids.
[00:25:10.189 --> 00:25:16.712]  All of this research should be made public, especially when you consider that their tests are highly regulatory.
[00:25:16.732 --> 00:25:17.632]  They're very contained.
[00:25:17.672 --> 00:25:19.153]  They're in a contained environment.
[00:25:19.473 --> 00:25:24.195]  They're only exposing them to these neonicotinoids for a short amount of time.
[00:25:24.515 --> 00:25:29.097]  This isn't what bees would be experiencing in the real world, in the real environment.
[00:25:29.478 --> 00:25:34.280]  They are, of course, going to be exposed to neonics and planting dust.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.141]  I think so.
[00:25:50.578 --> 00:25:54.943]  That scientists are saying, you need to be putting that out there so people can understand what we're dealing with.
[00:25:55.344 --> 00:26:02.292]  As well, you have a lot of independent researchers that are spending a lot of money on their own trying to do these type of field tests.
[00:26:02.392 --> 00:26:08.899]  And it would save them a lot of cost if this type of information that the public should have access to should be made public.
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:26.156]  So, if we can't even see that they're going to be forthcoming about the results of their tests that show that they do indeed cause harm to honeybee colonies, how can we expect them to be forthcoming about the results of, say, long-term health effects of genetically modified food?
[00:26:26.557 --> 00:26:34.004]  Because let's not forget, this is Bayer, who decades ago knowingly sold AIDS-infected medication to hemophiliacs.
[00:26:34.424 --> 00:26:44.834]  Internal documents show that after this company positively, absolutely knew that they had a medication that was infected with the AIDS virus, they took the product off the market in the U.S.
[00:26:44.874 --> 00:26:47.837]  and then they dumped it in France, Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
[00:26:48.197 --> 00:26:49.778]  The medicine's called Factor 8.
[00:26:49.838 --> 00:26:54.583]  It was an injection medicine that was used for hemophiliacs, mostly children.
[00:26:54.723 --> 00:26:56.645]  Children had been born with an incurable disease.
[00:26:56.665 --> 00:26:57.285]  Hold on, hold on, Mike.
[00:26:57.465 --> 00:26:58.086]  Hold on, hold on.
[00:26:58.206 --> 00:27:08.612]  So you're telling me that Bayer knew that this drug was infected with the AIDS virus, they yanked it from the market in America, and then they dumped it in markets overseas?
[00:27:08.952 --> 00:27:13.815]  They had to figure out a way, Joe, to make a profit on a product that they could not sell in America.
[00:27:14.352 --> 00:27:32.056]  So I'm sure when it comes to the future of the Bayer-Monsanto merger, or even with these tests coming out on the neonicotinoids and the long-term effects on honeybee colonies, I'm sure they're going to have the best interests of the public in mind when they're moving forward with their research, right?
[00:27:32.276 --> 00:27:41.365]  So these type of studies are the very studies that companies themselves say are so important, so vital to get out there, and yet they're not telling people what they find.
[00:27:41.705 --> 00:27:46.670]  They're only releasing these results if someone insists via a FOIA request.
[00:27:47.271 --> 00:27:49.773]  And for months, they've been downplaying the results.
[00:27:49.933 --> 00:27:55.379]  In fact, Syngenta actually told Greenpeace in August that none of the studies that Syngenta
[00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:56.239]  I don't know.
[00:28:17.972 --> 00:28:24.058]  And it's not just Bayer and Monsanto, but it's also Dow and DuPont, Syngenta and ChemChina.
[00:28:24.499 --> 00:28:30.144]  So these are corporations that are merging, and so consolidation equals monopoly.
[00:28:30.505 --> 00:28:36.571]  And where we're really going to start to see the effects of all of this power is if the Trans-Pacific Partnership passes.
[00:28:37.091 --> 00:28:48.135]  Now the reason why this will affect a lot of the world, a lot of the globe, is because some countries are actually rejecting bringing in Monsanto's genetically modified seeds into their country.
[00:28:48.175 --> 00:28:50.896]  They're rejecting bringing in these harmful insecticides.
[00:28:51.276 --> 00:28:59.159]  Well now, with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, corporate tribunals will actually take over the adjudication of disputes.
[00:28:59.979 --> 00:29:05.527]  In which a nation would reject importing toxic pesticides, GMOs, medical drugs.
[00:29:05.907 --> 00:29:12.616]  These tribunals will decide whether that nation is permitted to refuse importation.
[00:29:13.016 --> 00:29:17.963]  So of course these corporate tribunals are going to favor mega corporate interests.
[00:29:18.403 --> 00:29:20.945]  So this is the corporate face of globalism.
[00:29:21.025 --> 00:29:28.830]  This is going to give these companies the ability to shove these toxic products down our throats even if we are rejecting them outright.
[00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:33.973]  They are going to give themselves the power to completely override our country's sovereignty.
[00:29:34.293 --> 00:29:35.814]  And we've got to start to push back.
[00:29:36.134 --> 00:29:40.317]  Don't vote for anyone who plans on passing the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:29:40.657 --> 00:29:41.597]  This is dire.
[00:29:41.898 --> 00:29:42.718]  This is huge.
[00:29:42.978 --> 00:29:46.801]  This is a giant step in the direction of controlling the world's food supply.
[00:29:47.362 --> 00:29:49.963]  I'm Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:29:54.616 --> 00:29:57.218]  There's a troubling trend that's happening all across our country.
[00:29:57.258 --> 00:30:01.062]  People in Trump hats, Trump shirts, they're having the crap kicked out of them.
[00:30:01.122 --> 00:30:02.343]  Sometimes it's live-streamed.
[00:30:02.363 --> 00:30:05.086]  We have this one specific case coming out of El Cajon, California.
[00:30:05.546 --> 00:30:07.868]  A man could be seen walking outside of a restaurant.
[00:30:07.888 --> 00:30:10.030]  He had on a red Trump hat, Make America Great Again.
[00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:11.632]  He was attacked by a mob.
[00:30:12.092 --> 00:30:15.856]  They basically threw him to the ground, beaten him, kicked him, beat him up.
[00:30:16.036 --> 00:30:17.877]  They live-streamed it on Periscope.
[00:30:17.897 --> 00:30:19.259]  We actually have a video clip of this.
[00:30:19.759 --> 00:30:20.180]  Take a look.
[00:30:29.238 --> 00:30:31.761]  Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[00:30:31.962 --> 00:30:33.023]  This is what happens!
[00:30:33.083 --> 00:30:34.606]  This is what happens!
[00:30:34.626 --> 00:30:35.347]  This is what happens!
[00:30:35.367 --> 00:30:36.629]  This is what happens!
[00:30:36.749 --> 00:30:37.870]  Hey, hey, you got that?
[00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:40.314]  I've just been assaulted several times.
[00:30:40.414 --> 00:30:42.097]  I was assaulted several times.
[00:30:45.521 --> 00:30:47.622]  Several times I was assaulted for wearing my hat.
[00:30:47.722 --> 00:30:48.703]  You're ignorant now.
[00:30:48.803 --> 00:30:51.104]  Just for, just for I'm being assaulted.
[00:30:52.404 --> 00:30:53.725]  I'm being, I'm being assaulted.
[00:31:02.109 --> 00:31:08.937]  So the police arrived
[00:31:17.105 --> 00:31:17.245]  I don't
[00:31:39.574 --> 00:31:39.914]  I think so.
[00:32:00.883 --> 00:32:08.725]  The victim of the assault had chosen, she wants to remain anonymous because again, just like this young man, she wasn't trying to provoke an attack at all, she was simply just wearing a hat.
[00:32:09.405 --> 00:32:18.488]  And she resorted to asking campus security to escort her around college because she no longer feels safe, even at her own school because she was subject to physical assault.
[00:32:18.888 --> 00:32:21.429]  If people see the Trump support, they attack.
[00:32:21.949 --> 00:32:31.593]  We've seen the rise of Black Lives Matter, this movement that normalizes violence, normalizes the burning down of homes, businesses, cars, beating people in the streets simply for being Caucasian.
[00:32:31.633 --> 00:32:33.293]  It's normalized this in our society.
[00:32:33.693 --> 00:32:37.695]  But we're seeing that anger and aggression turned towards people who are openly supporting Trump in the streets.
[00:32:38.035 --> 00:32:42.417]  There's almost like a quiet fear that you're not supposed to say that you're a Trump supporter if in fact you are.
[00:32:42.857 --> 00:32:45.578]  You know, people are sometimes shocked to hear that other people,
[00:32:46.018 --> 00:32:48.362]  That are in their social circle are Trump supporters.
[00:32:48.382 --> 00:32:49.584]  It's almost like they're in the closet.
[00:32:49.604 --> 00:32:58.901]  But these two specific cases highlight what's happening around the country, unapologetically getting the crap kicked out of them and assaulted simply for supporting Donald J. Trump.
[00:33:02.526 --> 00:33:07.990]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:09.031]  Unveiled!
[00:33:09.431 --> 00:33:12.493]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula.
[00:33:13.174 --> 00:33:13.634]  30 servings.
[00:33:13.834 --> 00:33:16.436]  Fruit punch flavor dietary supplement.
[00:33:16.736 --> 00:33:17.797]  It is simply amazing.
[00:33:17.857 --> 00:33:18.818]  Infowarslife.com
[00:33:19.198 --> 00:33:23.600]  There's a million different products like this out there, but they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:37.227]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all of the essential amino acids, all of the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:38.808]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:40.029]  I put it in my protein shake.
[00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:46.133]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:49.175]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:51.456]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[00:33:52.057 --> 00:33:58.201]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:00.783]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[00:34:01.143 --> 00:34:03.004]  Okay, this... Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:05.346]  Yeah, this... I wanna... But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:05.726]  Yeah.
[00:34:05.946 --> 00:34:07.447]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:10.349]  There's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com that are excellent.
[00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:11.909]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.152]  This is just the very best we can bring you, and when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:39.919]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body, because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:41.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:41.087 --> 00:34:44.228]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[00:34:44.328 --> 00:34:45.568]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:46.168]  Tell folks about that.
[00:34:46.328 --> 00:34:49.088]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.589]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:55.670]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine.
[00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.510]  Each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.131]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:04.691]  34 other ones you can check out.
[00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.731]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:09.552]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:19.939]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just by the way look on the other side too because we're showing people the minerals and things let's look at the vitamins right there old Scott in there I mean it's amazing.
[00:35:19.979 --> 00:35:20.440]  Top left.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.862]  Again if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.285]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's the other source?
[00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.707]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:32.806]  Retinol.
[00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:37.328]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[00:35:37.649 --> 00:35:38.049]  And you know what?
[00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:40.290]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.110]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:48.154]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:53.997]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:55.358]  So get them today!

[00:36:00.442 --> 00:36:01.983]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:36:02.363 --> 00:36:08.288]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[00:36:08.508 --> 00:36:09.649]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:25.219]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:29.582]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:36:33.604 --> 00:36:40.686]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:36:41.026 --> 00:36:46.687]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:36:46.888 --> 00:36:53.009]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[00:36:53.309 --> 00:36:57.050]  Check them out today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[00:37:03.629 --> 00:37:09.351]  Well, we wanted to bring your attention to a huge story that's gone virtually unnoticed by the media.
[00:37:09.411 --> 00:37:13.091]  Of course, we've got this reality show playing out in real time here in the U.S.
[00:37:13.111 --> 00:37:14.492]  with this current election cycle.
[00:37:15.132 --> 00:37:20.073]  But we are also quite aware of the fact that World War III is a ruin.
[00:37:20.393 --> 00:37:22.074]  So it really doesn't matter who gets elected.
[00:37:22.714 --> 00:37:26.118]  Whoever it is, is going to have to be overseeing World War 3.
[00:37:26.558 --> 00:37:29.001]  Now, these are statements that were made by U.S.
[00:37:29.101 --> 00:37:42.815]  State Department spokesman John Kirby, basically threatening Moscow with terror attacks in Russian cities and even shooting down Russian jets if Putin continues to fight ISIS there in Syria.
[00:37:43.456 --> 00:37:45.838]  So take a listen to what Kirby had to say.
[00:37:45.898 --> 00:37:47.339]  Margaret, I mean this is just crazy.
[00:37:47.499 --> 00:37:53.544]  Someone who has been in Russia understands how threatening and volatile, like why are you poking this bear?
[00:37:53.904 --> 00:37:59.749]  So he says extremist groups will continue to exploit the vacuums that are there in Syria to expand their operations.
[00:38:00.009 --> 00:38:00.790]  Now, of course!
[00:38:21.292 --> 00:38:22.633]  Is this not true of U.S.
[00:38:22.653 --> 00:38:23.474]  troops as well?
[00:38:23.814 --> 00:38:24.694]  What is he saying?
[00:38:24.754 --> 00:38:29.918]  Of course, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson is taking these remarks as a thinly veiled threat.
[00:38:30.138 --> 00:38:31.679]  There's no veil, Leigh-Anne.
[00:38:31.759 --> 00:38:36.522]  They're absolutely threatening Russia, saying that we will come after you if you don't stop killing ISIS.
[00:38:36.542 --> 00:38:37.483]  That's the bottom line.
[00:38:37.563 --> 00:38:40.425]  And this State Department official, their spokesperson, John Kirby,
[00:38:40.865 --> 00:38:40.985]  He's
[00:38:56.664 --> 00:38:56.904]  Yeah.
[00:39:15.091 --> 00:39:19.596]  Also, Donald Trump made this incredible comment a few weeks ago, and largely unnoticed.
[00:39:19.957 --> 00:39:22.700]  He said, why the hell do we care if they're bombing ISIS?
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.823]  Why do we care if they're killing the terrorists?
[00:39:25.203 --> 00:39:26.825]  Isn't that in everybody's interest?
[00:39:26.845 --> 00:39:28.207]  You know, why don't we just let them?
[00:39:28.647 --> 00:39:31.631]  And the fact of the matter is, our own State Department
[00:39:32.211 --> 00:39:32.872]  I think so.
[00:39:54.286 --> 00:40:09.374]  And this is exactly what the Foreign Ministry spokesperson there in Russia is saying, that it sounds more, what John Kirby is saying, sounds more like a get-em command rather than a diplomatic comment, not trying to be polite, but, you know, hey, we're kind of in charge of these.
[00:40:09.774 --> 00:40:18.882]  Moderate rebels and boy, it would be a shame if they shot down some more of your jets and took out some more of your troops and perhaps even attacked your cities outright.
[00:40:19.142 --> 00:40:26.989]  Can you imagine if Putin had made some sort of a threat saying that, well, you know, ISIS could just come in and maybe take out some cities there in the US?
[00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:32.031]  Would that not be a red line that Obama would have to maybe go to war?
[00:40:32.071 --> 00:40:32.451]  Correct.
[00:40:32.491 --> 00:40:35.552]  That is such... So just putting ourselves in their shoes for a moment.
[00:40:35.652 --> 00:40:41.814]  If one superpower said to the US, we're going to send your guys home in body bags, we're going to destroy your aircraft because you're killing terrorists.
[00:40:42.115 --> 00:40:44.995]  Well, first of all, let's not forget that Syria is a sovereign nation.
[00:40:45.356 --> 00:40:48.537]  Russia is a sovereign state, also happens to be a world superpower.
[00:40:48.857 --> 00:40:52.618]  And the fact that we're using these provoking words, and Russia even frames it,
[00:40:52.958 --> 00:40:56.640]  You know, going back to how they see these statements, they're basically saying that this U.S.
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:03.784]  State Department spokesperson, John Kirby, and what he said this week, it's basically seen as a provocation prior to war.
[00:41:03.924 --> 00:41:05.565]  So we see this blustering.
[00:41:05.585 --> 00:41:13.949]  We saw it in World War II, where world leaders were threatening and doing these sort of provoking remarks months prior to the beginning of World War II.
[00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:15.150]  We're seeing this again.
[00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:16.511]  We're right on the cusp.
[00:41:17.171 --> 00:41:22.315]  And let's not forget, and I don't mean to get off topic here, but Wesley Clark, very famous general, once ran for president.
[00:41:22.355 --> 00:41:24.196]  Seven years ago, he said, look, the U.S.
[00:41:24.216 --> 00:41:26.638]  has a list of countries that we're planning on taking out.
[00:41:26.978 --> 00:41:27.758]  We're taking out.
[00:41:27.878 --> 00:41:29.259]  Iraq was on this list.
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:30.360]  So was Syria.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.201]  So was Libya.
[00:41:31.581 --> 00:41:33.602]  It ends with Iran, by the way.
[00:41:33.682 --> 00:41:35.143]  But Syria was on our list.
[00:41:35.544 --> 00:41:36.524]  We have an agenda.
[00:41:36.844 --> 00:41:38.305]  Russia's stopping our agenda.
[00:41:38.606 --> 00:41:40.987]  So now, oh, by the way, we also have to go after Russia.
[00:41:41.267 --> 00:41:41.908]  That's what's happening.
[00:41:42.268 --> 00:41:46.111]  You know and let's not forget this is of course just coming about two weeks after the U.S.
[00:41:46.172 --> 00:41:54.499]  reportedly became ISIS's air force by mistakenly taking out the base there and it's like I'm sorry but our military is not that stupid.
[00:41:54.759 --> 00:42:00.244]  This was a well set up base so it's not as if they mistakenly took out the wrong base and helped ISIS.
[00:42:00.724 --> 00:42:04.387]  So you know this is a major provocation and also
[00:42:05.248 --> 00:42:07.389]  Threatening World War 3 is absolutely insane.
[00:42:07.429 --> 00:42:14.932]  If you think about it, Trump's going to get in, he's making all these promises to the American people, but there's no way he's going to be able to uphold those promises if he gets elected.
[00:42:14.972 --> 00:42:25.256]  He's going to immediately have to start dealing with World War 3 that's being propped up, which is why Hillary Clinton can't wait to get in there because she's all ready to ride that little horse right into Armageddon.
[00:42:25.596 --> 00:42:33.359]  So let's kind of shift gears here and talk a little bit about Hillary Clinton and her plans to do whatever it takes to get elected.
[00:42:34.079 --> 00:42:34.700]  I don't know.
[00:42:55.117 --> 00:42:55.277]  Yeah.
[00:43:14.526 --> 00:43:19.767]  On InfoWars, what's that under Hillary's pantsuit during the debate?
[00:43:19.787 --> 00:43:21.208]  Did you see those pictures?
[00:43:21.268 --> 00:43:21.648]  Oh my!
[00:43:21.788 --> 00:43:24.669]  So she clearly has this box with a cord in her back.
[00:43:25.289 --> 00:43:30.270]  And we noticed on the first Commander and Chief Forum that she was wearing an earpiece very noticeably.
[00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:35.192]  And you would think that that would be a violation of the rules, but this time that wasn't noticeable.
[00:43:35.212 --> 00:43:37.112]  But what was noticeable was this cord in this case.
[00:43:37.752 --> 00:43:43.674]  I think it's, I personally think it is something that has to do with the electrodes going into her back so she doesn't have seizures.
[00:43:44.034 --> 00:43:45.214]  It's possible that it's medical.
[00:43:45.455 --> 00:43:55.558]  I think it's some type of a medical device, but either way, whatever it is, people can now clearly see it under these big boxy clothing that she's constantly wearing to hide these devices.
[00:43:56.058 --> 00:43:58.999]  And people deserve to know what the heck is going on with her health.
[00:43:59.399 --> 00:44:00.160]  But that's not even it.
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:01.400]  It doesn't even stop there.
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.121]  That's not even the weirdness.
[00:44:03.161 --> 00:44:05.521]  Now there was someone tweeted a video.
[00:44:06.282 --> 00:44:07.722]  If we can go ahead and put that video up.
[00:44:07.802 --> 00:44:09.043]  It's about this guy.
[00:44:09.123 --> 00:44:10.103]  Who's the guy with the
[00:44:11.414 --> 00:44:12.375]  With the briefcase.
[00:44:12.435 --> 00:44:14.176]  Or he takes Hillary Clinton's notes.
[00:44:14.236 --> 00:44:15.217]  So you just watch this.
[00:44:15.257 --> 00:44:15.897]  It'll play out.
[00:44:15.937 --> 00:44:16.818]  They're walking out.
[00:44:16.878 --> 00:44:18.739]  This was after that 5 minute delay.
[00:44:18.759 --> 00:44:20.521]  And you know, they go shake the moderator.
[00:44:20.581 --> 00:44:22.502]  Who's that guy up at Hillary Clinton's podium?
[00:44:22.782 --> 00:44:24.343]  Taking the little files out.
[00:44:24.884 --> 00:44:25.985]  They go shake hands.
[00:44:26.085 --> 00:44:28.526]  And he goes and stands over in the corner.
[00:44:28.607 --> 00:44:31.789]  And oh, gotta wait for Lester to get his attention.
[00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:32.930]  And then he walks over.
[00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:35.212]  And there's the little handoff.
[00:44:35.892 --> 00:44:36.733]  Who is that guy?
[00:44:37.013 --> 00:44:37.353]  Oh man.
[00:44:37.434 --> 00:44:37.914]  I don't know.
[00:44:37.934 --> 00:44:41.377]  I mean, maybe that's normal, but it's something that nobody noticed.
[00:44:41.397 --> 00:44:42.018]  They cut away.
[00:44:42.078 --> 00:44:46.421]  They have such a history of corruption that honestly, I honestly believe this.
[00:44:46.461 --> 00:44:47.903]  That lady's reality is so skewed.
[00:44:47.923 --> 00:44:50.065]  She doesn't understand when she's lying and telling the truth.
[00:44:50.525 --> 00:44:52.206]  And you talk about the skeletons in her closet.
[00:44:52.927 --> 00:44:54.308]  We were going to break down this earlier.
[00:44:54.688 --> 00:45:05.832]  James Comey, the director of the FBI, there was an article that came out that said the FBI, the agents handling it, had to sign these confidentiality agreements prior to even working on the Clinton investigation.
[00:45:05.872 --> 00:45:07.012]  So they had to protect themselves.
[00:45:07.372 --> 00:45:13.075]  And if they talked to the press or talked to the public in any way about Clinton, they would lose the careers, lose their pensions.
[00:45:13.475 --> 00:45:19.157]  And it looks like Comey has been one of the largest advocates in protecting the Clinton Foundation and her corruption scandals.
[00:45:19.637 --> 00:45:24.619]  Because the FBI agents, they were blocked from even serving search warrants in retrieving key evidence in some cases.
[00:45:24.639 --> 00:45:27.021]  There's this laundry list of things that they're not allowed to do.
[00:45:27.761 --> 00:45:32.883]  The FBI agents were even blocked and suppressed by DOJ brass, this article asserts.
[00:45:33.504 --> 00:45:35.665]  And, you know, they were basically used.
[00:45:36.085 --> 00:45:45.009]  And Cheryl Mills, mind you, and other people that were affiliated with Clinton that did her dirty work, two people connected to her server, they were both given criminal immunity from the FBI.
[00:45:45.029 --> 00:45:45.209]  Right.
[00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:47.511]  We're good.
[00:46:14.427 --> 00:46:27.795]  Mike Cernovich actually tweeted out to one of his friends, who's like this world-famous, world champion poker player, who said, indeed, signaling to the face like that is one of the oldest hand signals in the book to communicate.
[00:46:27.875 --> 00:46:32.739]  If they had been inside of a casino and she was doing that, they would have gotten taken off the table.
[00:46:33.379 --> 00:46:40.602]  And so what they're saying in this video is that every time she wanted to slap a zinger on Donald Trump, she would do this thing with her face.
[00:46:40.802 --> 00:46:42.163]  Very noticeable.
[00:46:42.643 --> 00:46:49.526]  And Lester Holt would either interject with Trump, he would interrupt Trump, or he would stay on that topic and throw to Hillary Clinton.
[00:46:49.847 --> 00:46:54.289]  So these people will do whatever it takes, they will stop at nothing to get this woman in.
[00:46:54.669 --> 00:46:54.929]  Why?
[00:46:55.029 --> 00:46:59.131]  I think it's because, you know, she wants to ride that train into World War III.

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.244 --> 00:48:52.724]  I don't know.
[00:49:04.363 --> 00:49:10.090]  Well, we wanted to bring your attention to a huge story that's gone virtually unnoticed by the media.
[00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:13.775]  Of course, we've got this reality show playing out in real time here in the U.S.
[00:49:13.835 --> 00:49:15.237]  with this current election cycle.
[00:49:15.858 --> 00:49:20.824]  But we are also quite aware of the fact that World War III is a ruin.
[00:49:21.124 --> 00:49:22.826]  So it really doesn't matter who gets elected.
[00:49:23.427 --> 00:49:26.868]  Whoever it is, is going to have to be overseeing World War III.
[00:49:27.268 --> 00:49:29.709]  Now, these are statements that were made by U.S.
[00:49:29.809 --> 00:49:43.533]  State Department spokesman John Kirby, basically threatening Moscow with terror attacks in Russian cities and even shooting down Russian jets if Putin continues to fight ISIS there in Syria.
[00:49:44.173 --> 00:49:46.555]  So take a listen to what Kirby had to say.
[00:49:46.615 --> 00:49:48.056]  Margaret, I mean this is just crazy.
[00:49:48.216 --> 00:49:54.260]  Someone who has been in Russia understands how threatening and volatile, like why are you poking this bear?
[00:49:54.621 --> 00:50:00.465]  So he says extremist groups will continue to exploit the vacuums that are there in Syria to expand their operations.
[00:50:00.725 --> 00:50:01.526]  Now, of course!
[00:50:22.029 --> 00:50:23.350]  Is this not true of U.S.
[00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:24.191]  troops as well?
[00:50:24.531 --> 00:50:25.412]  What is he saying?
[00:50:25.492 --> 00:50:30.636]  Of course, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson is taking these remarks as a thinly veiled threat.
[00:50:30.856 --> 00:50:32.417]  There's no veil, Leigh-Anne.
[00:50:32.477 --> 00:50:37.241]  They're absolutely threatening Russia, saying that we will come after you if you don't stop killing ISIS.
[00:50:37.261 --> 00:50:38.222]  That's the bottom line.
[00:50:38.302 --> 00:50:47.129]  And this State Department official, their spokesperson, John Kirby, he's not even masking the fact that he's threatening their military craft, their citizens, their cities.
[00:50:47.289 --> 00:50:49.191]  This is major, major news.
[00:50:49.631 --> 00:50:50.692]  This is not hyped up.
[00:50:50.732 --> 00:50:52.213]  There's no drama involved in this.
[00:50:52.293 --> 00:50:55.195]  We are literally on the precipice of World War Three.
[00:50:55.315 --> 00:51:04.482]  And as somebody who, who understands the dynamics somewhat just from living and working in Moscow, they, they see us, everything that we do is a provocation.
[00:51:04.502 --> 00:51:05.463]  I really didn't understand it.
[00:51:05.503 --> 00:51:08.726]  So you get outside from behind the propaganda of the U.S.
[00:51:08.766 --> 00:51:12.809]  and you do realize, oh my gosh, we do have missiles pointed on the Russian border.
[00:51:12.889 --> 00:51:15.371]  We are threatening their military aircraft and hey,
[00:51:15.791 --> 00:51:20.313]  Also, Donald Trump made this incredible comment a few weeks ago, largely unnoticed.
[00:51:20.673 --> 00:51:23.414]  He said, why the hell do we care if they're bombing ISIS?
[00:51:23.474 --> 00:51:25.534]  Why do we care if they're killing the terrorists?
[00:51:25.915 --> 00:51:27.535]  Isn't that in everybody's interest?
[00:51:27.555 --> 00:51:28.916]  You know, why don't we just let them?
[00:51:29.376 --> 00:51:35.738]  And the fact of the matter is, our own State Department has armed these rebels that are now ISIS.
[00:51:36.138 --> 00:51:43.946]  They've given them the northern part of Iraq, which is in vast control of the oil in Iraq, which they're selling to China, by the way, and funding more terrorism.
[00:51:44.126 --> 00:51:46.348]  And we, in a preliminary stage, funded them.
[00:51:46.368 --> 00:51:50.513]  I don't know if you recall John McCain going to Syria, standing with the rebels.
[00:51:50.533 --> 00:51:51.373]  Well, guess what?
[00:51:51.574 --> 00:51:53.676]  They're now destroying and targeting U.S.
[00:51:53.736 --> 00:51:54.296]  citizens.
[00:51:54.997 --> 00:52:06.380]  And this is exactly what the Foreign Ministry spokesperson there in Russia is saying, that it sounds more, what John Kirby is saying, sounds more like a get-em command, rather than a diplomatic comment.
[00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:19.603]  Not trying to be polite, but, you know, hey, we're kind of in charge of these moderate rebels, and boy, it would be a shame if they shot down some more of your jets, and took out some more of your troops, and perhaps even attacked your cities outright.
[00:52:19.863 --> 00:52:23.804]  Can you imagine if Putin had made some sort of a threat, saying that, well, you know,
[00:52:24.324 --> 00:52:28.087]  ISIS could just come in and maybe take out some cities there in the U.S.
[00:52:28.808 --> 00:52:32.771]  Would that not be a red line that Obama would have to maybe go to war?
[00:52:32.811 --> 00:52:33.171]  Correct.
[00:52:33.211 --> 00:52:42.538]  That is such... So just putting ourselves in their shoes for a moment, if one superpower said to the U.S., we're going to send your guys home in body bags, we're going to destroy your aircraft because you're killing terrorists.
[00:52:42.839 --> 00:52:45.721]  Well, first of all, let's not forget that Syria is a sovereign nation.
[00:52:46.081 --> 00:52:49.264]  Russia is a sovereign state, also happens to be a world superpower.
[00:52:49.604 --> 00:52:53.347]  And the fact that we're using these provoking words, and Russia even frames it,
[00:52:53.667 --> 00:52:57.368]  You know, going back to how they see these statements, they're basically saying that this U.S.
[00:52:57.388 --> 00:53:04.510]  State Department spokesperson, John Kirby, and what he said this week, it's basically seen as a provocation prior to war.
[00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:06.271]  So, we see this blustering.
[00:53:06.311 --> 00:53:14.673]  We saw it in World War II, where world leaders were threatening and doing these sort of provoking remarks months prior to the beginning of World War II.
[00:53:14.953 --> 00:53:15.873]  We're seeing this again.
[00:53:15.913 --> 00:53:17.234]  We're right on the cusp.
[00:53:17.894 --> 00:53:23.037]  And let's not forget, and I don't mean to get off topic here, but Wesley Clark, very famous general, once ran for president.
[00:53:23.077 --> 00:53:24.898]  Seven years ago, he said, look, the U.S.
[00:53:24.938 --> 00:53:27.359]  has a list of countries that we're planning on taking out.
[00:53:27.679 --> 00:53:28.480]  We're taking out.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:29.980]  Iraq was on this list.
[00:53:30.301 --> 00:53:31.081]  So was Syria.
[00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:31.921]  So was Libya.
[00:53:32.302 --> 00:53:34.323]  It ends with Iran, by the way.
[00:53:34.403 --> 00:53:35.863]  But Syria was on our list.
[00:53:36.264 --> 00:53:37.224]  We have an agenda.
[00:53:37.564 --> 00:53:39.025]  Russia's stopping our agenda.
[00:53:39.325 --> 00:53:41.706]  So now, oh, by the way, we also have to go after Russia.
[00:53:41.987 --> 00:53:42.627]  That's what's happening.
[00:53:42.987 --> 00:53:46.831]  You know and let's not forget this is of course just coming about two weeks after the U.S.
[00:53:46.891 --> 00:53:55.218]  reportedly became ISIS's air force by mistakenly taking out the base there and it's like I'm sorry but our military is not that stupid.
[00:53:55.479 --> 00:54:00.964]  This was a well set up base so it's not as if they mistakenly took out the wrong base and helped ISIS.
[00:54:01.444 --> 00:54:05.107]  So you know this is a major provocation and also
[00:54:05.968 --> 00:54:08.108]  Threatening World War 3 is absolutely insane.
[00:54:08.148 --> 00:54:15.650]  If you think about it, Trump's going to get in, he's making all these promises to the American people, but there's no way he's going to be able to uphold those promises if he gets elected.
[00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:25.951]  He's going to immediately have to start dealing with World War 3 that's being propped up, which is why Hillary Clinton can't wait to get in there because she's all ready to ride that little horse right into Armageddon.
[00:54:26.312 --> 00:54:34.073]  So let's kind of shift gears here and talk a little bit about Hillary Clinton and her plans to do whatever it takes to get elected.
[00:54:34.813 --> 00:54:35.394]  I think so.
[00:54:55.834 --> 00:54:55.994]  Yeah.
[00:55:15.243 --> 00:55:20.486]  On InfoWars, what's that under Hillary's pantsuit during the debate?
[00:55:21.106 --> 00:55:21.947]  Did you see those pictures?
[00:55:21.987 --> 00:55:22.367]  Oh my!
[00:55:22.507 --> 00:55:25.389]  So she clearly has this box with a cord in her back.
[00:55:26.009 --> 00:55:30.992]  And we noticed on the first Commander-in-Chief Forum that she was wearing an earpiece, very noticeably.
[00:55:31.232 --> 00:55:35.914]  And you would think that that would be a violation of the rules, but this time that wasn't noticeable.
[00:55:35.954 --> 00:55:37.835]  But what was noticeable was this cord in this case.
[00:55:38.676 --> 00:55:44.399]  I personally think it is something that has to do with the electrodes going into her back so she doesn't have seizures.
[00:55:44.759 --> 00:55:45.940]  It's possible it's medical.
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:47.862]  I think it's some type of a medical device.
[00:55:48.242 --> 00:55:56.290]  But either way, whatever it is, people can now clearly see it under these big boxy clothing that she's constantly wearing to hide these devices.
[00:55:56.770 --> 00:55:59.753]  And people deserve to know what the heck is going on with her health.
[00:56:00.133 --> 00:56:00.874]  But that's not even it.
[00:56:01.054 --> 00:56:02.135]  It doesn't even stop there.
[00:56:02.235 --> 00:56:03.856]  That's not even the weirdness.
[00:56:03.896 --> 00:56:06.259]  Now there was someone tweeted a video.
[00:56:07.019 --> 00:56:08.461]  If we can go ahead and put that video up.
[00:56:08.541 --> 00:56:09.782]  It's about this guy.
[00:56:09.862 --> 00:56:10.843]  Who's the guy with the
[00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:13.091]  With the briefcase.
[00:56:13.151 --> 00:56:14.913]  Or he takes Hillary Clinton's notes.
[00:56:14.953 --> 00:56:15.933]  So you just watch this.
[00:56:15.974 --> 00:56:16.614]  It'll play out.
[00:56:16.654 --> 00:56:17.555]  They're walking out.
[00:56:17.595 --> 00:56:19.457]  This was after that five minute delay.
[00:56:19.477 --> 00:56:21.238]  And, you know, they go shake the moderator.
[00:56:21.298 --> 00:56:23.220]  Who's that guy up at Hillary Clinton's podium?
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:25.062]  Taking the little files out.
[00:56:25.602 --> 00:56:26.703]  They go shake hands.
[00:56:26.803 --> 00:56:29.246]  And he goes and stands over in the corner.
[00:56:29.326 --> 00:56:32.509]  And, oh, gotta wait for Lester to, you know, get his attention.
[00:56:32.569 --> 00:56:33.670]  And then he walks over.
[00:56:34.631 --> 00:56:35.932]  And there's the little handoff.
[00:56:36.613 --> 00:56:37.453]  Who is that guy?
[00:56:37.734 --> 00:56:38.074]  Oh, man.
[00:56:38.174 --> 00:56:38.635]  I don't know.
[00:56:38.655 --> 00:56:42.098]  I mean, maybe that's normal, but it's something that nobody noticed.
[00:56:42.118 --> 00:56:42.739]  They cut away.
[00:56:42.819 --> 00:56:47.143]  They have such a history of corruption that, honestly, I honestly believe this.
[00:56:47.184 --> 00:56:48.625]  That lady's reality is so skewed.
[00:56:48.645 --> 00:56:50.787]  She doesn't understand when she's lying and telling the truth.
[00:56:51.248 --> 00:56:52.929]  And you talk about the skeletons in her closet.
[00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:55.031]  We were going to break down this earlier.
[00:56:55.411 --> 00:57:06.556]  James Comey, the director of the FBI, there was an article that came out that said the FBI, the agents handling it, had to sign these confidentiality agreements prior to even working on the Clinton investigation.
[00:57:06.596 --> 00:57:07.736]  So they had to protect themselves.
[00:57:08.097 --> 00:57:13.799]  And if they talked to the press or talked to the public in any way about Clinton, they would lose the careers, lose their pensions.
[00:57:14.199 --> 00:57:19.882]  And it looks like Comey has been one of the largest advocates in protecting the Clinton Foundation and her corruption scandals.
[00:57:20.202 --> 00:57:20.562]  I think so.
[00:57:36.798 --> 00:57:45.705]  And Cheryl Mills, mind you, and other people that were affiliated with Clinton that did her dirty work, two people connected to her server, they were both given criminal immunity from the FBI.
[00:57:45.725 --> 00:57:52.350]  That was the only way they would let them get into their emails to their own private servers, is that they would have to have immunity.
[00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:59.015]  And of course, how weird is that that Cheryl Mills was able to represent Hillary Clinton during this investigation, even though she was involved in it.
[00:57:59.155 --> 00:58:00.156]  So all super creepy.
[00:58:00.456 --> 00:58:05.340]  And then of course, let's not forget that there's also people saying that Hillary Clinton gave hand signals
[00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:07.683]  To the debate moderator Lester Holt.
[00:58:08.244 --> 00:58:10.768]  We've got the video continues to be taken down.
[00:58:10.848 --> 00:58:13.252]  It keeps getting slapped with a copyright.
[00:58:13.572 --> 00:58:20.563]  But Mike Cernovich actually tweeted out to one of his friends who's like this world-famous world champion poker player.
[00:58:21.144 --> 00:58:21.604]  We're good to go.
[00:58:40.401 --> 00:58:40.841]  I don't think so.
[00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:09.935]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.396 --> 00:59:20.085]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:24.166]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.726 --> 00:59:29.387]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.787 --> 00:59:36.008]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
