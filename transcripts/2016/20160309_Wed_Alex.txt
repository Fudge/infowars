[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.532]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:15.154 --> 00:00:15.794]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:17.475]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.215 --> 00:00:19.336]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.976 --> 00:00:20.797]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.577 --> 00:00:22.477]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.118 --> 00:00:26.740]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.362]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:34.083]  Alex Jones here on the road.
[00:00:34.103 --> 00:00:41.365]  I'll be coming up live in the second hour today and also filing key breaking video news reports.
[00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:45.687]  And of course my co-host will be coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:00:46.267 --> 00:00:48.068]  But wow, huge developments.
[00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:53.130]  I'd like to be able to just come up here and say, wonderful news ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump
[00:00:54.111 --> 00:01:01.698]  Uh, you know, dominated in Super Tuesday Part 2 in a big way, panicking the system.
[00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.442]  Rubio is clearly sinking the establishment candidate.
[00:01:06.043 --> 00:01:11.228]  We have seen a cruise surge overall, clearly into second place.
[00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:19.405]  The really big issue here is the Infowars.com posted article from the Daily Caller.
[00:01:20.145 --> 00:01:23.046]  It's also obviously in the Russian and British newspapers.
[00:01:23.726 --> 00:01:24.647]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:01:24.707 --> 00:01:25.687]  This is no joke.
[00:01:26.388 --> 00:01:40.733]  The Russian foreign ministry has sent a direct letter to Kim Jong-un and then publicly published it, saying it is unpermissible to threaten preemptive nuclear strikes on South Korea or anybody else.
[00:01:41.153 --> 00:01:42.054]  For those that don't know,
[00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:52.062]  Russia, for a small area, borders North Korea, and also on a large border, China.
[00:01:53.142 --> 00:02:06.427]  And even China, the Chinese Communist government, came out last week and had the strongest threats ever towards North Korea, who they've kind of controlled since the 1950s Korean War as a set piece.
[00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.148]  There is a nuclear trigger in the region.
[00:02:09.848 --> 00:02:12.349]  Obviously, we need to get Joel Skousen
[00:02:13.487 --> 00:02:21.151]  A World Affairs Brief on it continues to warn that this will be the real trigger that the Middle East is important but distractionary overall.
[00:02:22.031 --> 00:02:24.612]  But look, you could have Syria as a trigger now, you could have North Korea.
[00:02:25.173 --> 00:02:31.536]  Unprecedented to have that demonic, fat little, soft vampire rat.
[00:02:32.216 --> 00:02:35.658]  And look, I don't usually use names for people, but he deserves it.
[00:02:36.218 --> 00:02:38.659]  He is the ultimate example of trash.
[00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:40.240]  A third generation
[00:02:41.408 --> 00:02:53.098]  Hereditary dictator who grew up at a beyond five star boarding school in Switzerland who is so disconnected from reality he thinks Dennis Rodman is cool.
[00:02:55.039 --> 00:03:02.765]  Who has most of his family executed and has people killed with mortars and artillery for his entertainment.
[00:03:04.026 --> 00:03:07.770]  Who lives in a complete fantasy land with a bunch of starving scarecrows
[00:03:08.826 --> 00:03:12.447]  Being forced to worship him as hundreds of thousands starve to death a year.
[00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:14.328]  This is your state.
[00:03:14.468 --> 00:03:17.609]  This is your feel the burn world.
[00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:23.892]  This is what socialism and communism and collectivism and fascism and all forms of centralization.
[00:03:25.253 --> 00:03:48.639]  Command and Control baguette is gangs and thugs and rule by insider cliques and Russia is just so on target over and over again telling the West, you move nuclear weapons up against our borders and threaten us and put proxy armies in, we're moving nukes in and if it looks like you're about to use them on our troops, we're going to hit you.
[00:03:50.137 --> 00:04:04.772]  Okay, and then telling Turkey, if you mass wave attack us with artillery and with a large army you're forming of over 100,000 troops and mercenaries out of Saudi Arabia, we're going to use a tactical nuke on you.
[00:04:05.233 --> 00:04:08.276]  Now that's classic legal tactics.
[00:04:08.416 --> 00:04:10.058]  If you're being invaded, if you're being hit,
[00:04:10.973 --> 00:04:16.415]  by a large attack that you can't repulse, using a tactical nuclear weapon on it.
[00:04:17.275 --> 00:04:30.278]  The difference is, and that's US policy as well, and it makes sense, it's mutually assured destruction basically at a tactical level, not just a ICBM, intercontinental, nation against nation level.
[00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:39.201]  But if you expand on that, and this is what's really important, North Korea is threatening to just nuke the capital of South Korea
[00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:53.930]  If they don't, quote, capitulate to match their demands, that's nuclear terrorism, that's holding people hostage, and it's a lot bigger than all the Al-Qaeda threats they're constantly hyping to take our freedoms, even as the government gets caught shipping the Al-Qaeda and ISIS threat in itself.
[00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:57.513]  We'll be back after break to go over all this and a lot more.
[00:04:57.854 --> 00:05:01.977]  I'm Alex Jones, and never forget, if you're listening or watching this transmission, you know it's true.
[00:05:02.397 --> 00:05:05.160]  Get active, get involved, because you are the resistance.
[00:05:08.948 --> 00:05:17.370]  In the last Democratic debate, we learned that there are no poor white people and that Hillary Clinton single-handedly saved the auto industry.
[00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.371]  What will we learn this time around?
[00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:22.011]  First, they wouldn't debate at all.
[00:05:22.351 --> 00:05:26.152]  Then, only during NFL playoff games or Christmas Eve.
[00:05:26.452 --> 00:05:29.393]  Well, finally, the moment you've been waiting for is here.
[00:05:29.793 --> 00:05:33.074]  Watch the InfoWars crew dismantle the Democratic debate.

[00:06:11.591 --> 00:06:19.595]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[00:08:15.367 --> 00:08:21.071]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is March 9th, 2016 on this Wednesday Worldwide Broadcast and wow!
[00:08:21.111 --> 00:08:27.695]  We saw another big primary night last night and Donald Trump
[00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:46.394]  Again, dominated and won so many of the key states.
[00:08:46.795 --> 00:08:48.716]  We're going to be walking through all that today.
[00:08:49.597 --> 00:08:53.460]  We have him winning Hawaii, the coveted Michigan, and Mississippi.
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.382]  But those are not winner-take-all.
[00:08:56.922 --> 00:09:00.065]  And that's been the Republican strategy, we told you about almost three weeks ago.
[00:09:00.445 --> 00:09:01.946]  Now it was in the Washington Post yesterday.
[00:09:02.346 --> 00:09:07.090]  The Republican establishment does intend to steal the election at the
[00:09:08.371 --> 00:09:15.654]  primary level once they get into the Republican National Convention before it ever gets into the general election.
[00:09:16.114 --> 00:09:23.397]  I don't think they're going to be successful because it's so much momentum is getting behind Trump, but they're throwing everything they've got at him right now.
[00:09:23.777 --> 00:09:26.198]  So Trump has 558 delegates.
[00:09:27.119 --> 00:09:30.540]  Ted Cruz is clearly second place now.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:30.540]  359.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:35.082]  Rubio, the big news obviously on the Republican side, is that Rubio
[00:09:36.224 --> 00:09:37.786]  He's now clearly out of the race.
[00:09:38.246 --> 00:09:39.927]  Even most mainline analysts agree.
[00:09:39.948 --> 00:09:42.290]  So that's another establishment darling falling.
[00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.111]  And of course, Kasich at 54.
[00:09:45.272 --> 00:09:49.216]  Clearly never really in the race, but they're trying to prop him up as well.
[00:09:49.736 --> 00:09:52.539]  Now, Donald Trump has come out and called for unity.
[00:09:54.105 --> 00:09:56.766]  In a speech last night.
[00:09:57.867 --> 00:10:05.650]  And so it's important that we basically play some of his victory speech and what he was calling for.
[00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:06.991]  Here's some of those highlights.
[00:10:08.511 --> 00:10:09.031]  Carl, thank you.
[00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:12.193]  Let's take a listen to the winner tonight in Michigan and Mississippi.
[00:10:12.213 --> 00:10:17.055]  I don't think I've ever had so many horrible, horrible things said about me in one week.
[00:10:19.686 --> 00:10:23.087]  38 million dollars worth of horrible lies, but that's okay.
[00:10:23.507 --> 00:10:26.228]  It shows you how brilliant the public is.
[00:10:26.988 --> 00:10:31.229]  Because they knew they were lies, and it was just really amazing to watch.
[00:10:31.749 --> 00:10:37.971]  I think what this shows, really more than anything else, is that advertising is not as important.
[00:10:38.431 --> 00:10:40.752]  It really isn't as important as competence.
[00:10:41.477 --> 00:10:46.539]  Because there has never been more money spent on hitting somebody than was spent on me.
[00:10:47.299 --> 00:10:53.002]  And between that and people saying things and, you know, Lindsey Graham goes and... He's a nasty person.
[00:10:53.242 --> 00:10:54.903]  First of all, he's wrong on the military.
[00:10:54.943 --> 00:10:57.804]  He truly... This is why he's... He said, I've been doing this for 15 years.
[00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:00.625]  That's right, we've been fighting a war for 15 years with this kind of thinking.
[00:11:01.726 --> 00:11:05.527]  I mean, if you're gonna fight a war, win the war and let's get back to rebuilding our country, okay?
[00:11:05.767 --> 00:11:07.368]  But Marco helped me a lot because...
[00:11:08.368 --> 00:11:09.830]  He called Ted a liar!
[00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:10.851]  He said, you're a liar!
[00:11:11.091 --> 00:11:12.073]  That's the first time!
[00:11:12.133 --> 00:11:14.095]  Look, I know politicians better than anybody.
[00:11:14.516 --> 00:11:15.577]  They're liars, okay?
[00:11:15.617 --> 00:11:16.458]  They're serious liars.
[00:11:17.685 --> 00:11:20.027]  More importantly, they'll never get you to the promised land.
[00:11:20.187 --> 00:11:20.387]  Ever.
[00:11:20.808 --> 00:11:22.529]  They'll never get you to the promised land.
[00:11:22.569 --> 00:11:23.089]  They won't do it.
[00:11:23.109 --> 00:11:25.151]  Because they're controlled by the special interests.
[00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:28.314]  They're controlled by the people that put up all this money for them to run.
[00:11:28.734 --> 00:11:29.174]  They're controlled.
[00:11:29.194 --> 00:11:32.077]  You know how much money was spent in the last week on me?
[00:11:32.097 --> 00:11:38.662]  And do you know how many times they were asking, despite the fact that they're not supposed to be talking to their super PAC?
[00:11:39.671 --> 00:11:42.295]  Carl, fellas, let me ask you a question.
[00:11:42.475 --> 00:11:47.543]  How many times do you think Marco and Ted and all of them were calling their super PACs?
[00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:49.966]  Now, let's look at the Democrats' side.
[00:11:50.848 --> 00:11:54.212]  Bernie scored a big upset victory in Michigan.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.102]  Hillary clearly is stealing the election all over the country.
[00:11:57.122 --> 00:12:03.848]  She's been caught from Iowa to places like the situation in New Hampshire.
[00:12:04.208 --> 00:12:06.531]  She says the delegates are mine, the superdelegates are mine.
[00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:07.191]  It doesn't matter.
[00:12:07.512 --> 00:12:08.693]  The party's going to give it to me.
[00:12:10.634 --> 00:12:15.519]  This is just simply amazing that this is happening again so nakedly.
[00:12:15.799 --> 00:12:17.341]  The Democrats stealing it openly.
[00:12:18.157 --> 00:12:23.601]  The Republicans say they're going to steal it openly, but the Democrats are already doing it.
[00:12:24.001 --> 00:12:30.525]  And we have a lot of evidence that there is point shaving, because it's not winner-take-all in most of these states, in the Republican primaries as well.
[00:12:30.605 --> 00:12:38.130]  Again, so Trump doesn't get that key 50-plus percent of the delegates so they can challenge the nomination.
[00:12:39.451 --> 00:12:42.914]  I know you know that, but we better get that news out to the general public.
[00:12:43.474 --> 00:12:44.495]  This is one of the few times
[00:12:46.621 --> 00:12:49.422]  Where the fact that they can steal elections is now widely known.
[00:12:49.762 --> 00:13:09.851]  We need to hammer that point home and let the Republican precinct chairs, delegates, superdelegates, everyone know that if they steal the popular vote from the record numbers of people that have come into the Republican Party with Trump's big tent approach, it's really what it is, his populist approach, you're going to hold them personally responsible.
[00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:13.561]  You're going to run against them in office.
[00:13:13.601 --> 00:13:16.864]  You're going to make it a personal political beef.
[00:13:18.065 --> 00:13:20.828]  If they engage in this type of activity, you're going to get their name in the newspaper.
[00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:24.451]  The shame of stealing the popular vote from the people.
[00:13:25.092 --> 00:13:25.952]  That's what this is all about.
[00:13:27.193 --> 00:13:29.896]  Now, shifting gears, the story is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:13:29.996 --> 00:13:31.838]  The story is up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:13:31.898 --> 00:13:34.020]  We're going to cover it in a moment.
[00:13:35.427 --> 00:13:38.169]  Russia is threatening to invade North Korea.
[00:13:38.309 --> 00:13:39.350]  We're going to get to that in a moment.
[00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:45.535]  North Korea obviously has been threatening nuclear terror, holding the world hostage if they don't submit and give them what they want.
[00:13:46.075 --> 00:13:48.678]  Now, is our Pentagon saying anything about that?
[00:13:48.698 --> 00:13:48.738]  No.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.365]  They hope there's some big conflict, at least the presidential level, because that's a distraction from Barack Obama.
[00:13:55.725 --> 00:13:58.328]  This is the dangerous military climate we've gotten into.
[00:13:58.829 --> 00:14:06.217]  But North Korea, according to my research and many other experts like Joel Skousen, is the key trigger for World War III, or what the Pentagon calls World War IV.
[00:14:06.497 --> 00:14:08.859]  They call the Cold War, World War, World War III.
[00:14:10.083 --> 00:14:13.706]  Separately, there is a new report out, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:14.026 --> 00:14:18.729]  Pentagon admits military spy drones over the USA.
[00:14:19.049 --> 00:14:20.931]  And that's in USA Today.
[00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:25.634]  Again, the story is on DrugsReport.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:14:25.674 --> 00:14:30.958]  We need the flashback articles from 10 years ago, 5 years ago, 3 years ago, a year ago.
[00:14:31.018 --> 00:14:32.799]  Somebody should write an article of our great reporters.
[00:14:33.099 --> 00:14:34.260]  It ought to be Kurt Demme, probably.
[00:14:35.422 --> 00:14:36.263]  And it should just be.
[00:14:37.364 --> 00:14:41.127]  Infowars, Drudge, proven right about military drones over the U.S.
[00:14:41.648 --> 00:14:51.056]  Remember all those articles five years ago and three years ago and two years ago saying Jones is insane, Kurt Nemo is insane, Matt Drudge is lying, because Drudge would run our stories.
[00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:53.398]  There are no military drones over the U.S.
[00:14:53.418 --> 00:14:58.282]  And they would write these articles in USA Today of all places did it.
[00:14:59.463 --> 00:15:00.984]  It was in columns all over the country.
[00:15:01.004 --> 00:15:02.706]  It was a big push several times.
[00:15:04.222 --> 00:15:07.565]  We could pull the articles up saying we were lying about drones and that it was a conspiracy theory.
[00:15:07.585 --> 00:15:13.530]  Kind of like we were lying about the NSA spying on you, or Obamacare being a huge rip-off, which everybody knows it is now.
[00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:16.332]  They'd say, it's a conspiracy, there are no taxes in it.
[00:15:18.054 --> 00:15:18.874]  It's a conspiracy.
[00:15:19.955 --> 00:15:21.116]  It doesn't fine you.
[00:15:21.156 --> 00:15:23.858]  And then the Supreme Court ruled it's a tax and it does fine you.
[00:15:24.018 --> 00:15:25.039]  It was in the stinkin' bill!
[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:26.801]  They just hope you don't go read.
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:48.477]  It was in local newspapers in the Dakotas and in Texas and all over that they had predator drones assigned to Homeland Security under Pentagon control and CIA control, they have two different fleets, watching farmers in Colorado and Texas and South Dakota going after quote cattle rustlers.
[00:15:48.837 --> 00:15:55.823]  Remember the cattle kept coming over on the property under state law in that state, you know, you can take them at that point because the neighbors were just letting their cows be on their property.
[00:15:56.929 --> 00:15:57.769]  You know, you can't do that.
[00:15:57.789 --> 00:16:03.752]  I mean, we've taken cows on our ranch, and we've had some ours about 20-something years ago taken the third time they went over in a guy's yard.
[00:16:04.132 --> 00:16:06.614]  Now, my grandfather didn't like the neighbor too much after that.
[00:16:09.315 --> 00:16:12.076]  But, you know, still, that's the law.
[00:16:12.136 --> 00:16:16.518]  He got to keep some of his cows, including his prized bull that broke through the fence to go after his cows.
[00:16:17.198 --> 00:16:19.740]  So, they used predator drones on that.
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.241]  And then we were just linking to the local articles.
[00:16:23.305 --> 00:16:24.025]  That's what's crazy.
[00:16:24.065 --> 00:16:26.187]  We weren't breaking it ourselves.
[00:16:26.887 --> 00:16:37.753]  It's like the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp or the Emergency Centers Establishment Act that Obama put in saying for patriots that they believe an uprising is coming, quote, re-education camps.
[00:16:38.133 --> 00:16:41.535]  Just type in Army Manual Admits Preparation for Internment Camps.
[00:16:41.655 --> 00:16:45.417]  They use the word re-education camp, how to process our social security numbers.
[00:16:47.854 --> 00:16:54.437]  I expect when I cover this next article that they'll probably have a Media Matters article out saying nuclear war is about to happen.
[00:16:54.817 --> 00:16:55.838]  No, I'm not saying it.
[00:16:55.958 --> 00:17:00.640]  Daily Caller is reporting on the Russian newspapers and the British newspapers.
[00:17:02.221 --> 00:17:03.842]  Again, they just hope you don't check reality.
[00:17:04.202 --> 00:17:06.263]  Russia threatens invasion of North Korea.
[00:17:07.604 --> 00:17:13.026]  If nuclear rhetoric continues, the warning was issued in the form of a written statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry.
[00:17:14.067 --> 00:17:16.648]  Because North Korea keeps threatening to nuke
[00:17:17.622 --> 00:17:26.546]  To nuke the capital of South Korea that's got like more than 10 million people in it, but Seoul, that's only like 35 miles from the border.
[00:17:27.407 --> 00:17:38.132]  If they don't capitulate and just let North Korea have their money, have their trade routes, and just follow up this little goblin-like collectivist rat.
[00:17:38.192 --> 00:17:39.373]  I mean, look at the communism!
[00:17:39.673 --> 00:17:43.315]  Another hereditary dictator ruling over everyone and vampirically
[00:17:43.795 --> 00:17:51.841]  Literally having sex slaves in a seven-story pleasure palace that his dad built, and weird giant pyramid buildings that they can't even put windows in.
[00:17:52.442 --> 00:17:54.643]  This is what communism and collectivism... But don't worry!
[00:17:54.884 --> 00:18:00.348]  Lots of uniforms, lots of big hats, lots of medals, lots of checkpoints, lots of spies!
[00:18:01.653 --> 00:18:04.695]  This is the conquest, parasite economy we're fighting against.
[00:18:04.736 --> 00:18:11.001]  This is a parasite economy, a conquest economy versus a renaissance, free will, truth economy.
[00:18:11.481 --> 00:18:19.668]  And I see America with social justice warriors and all the political correctness where there's all these losers and nobodies that want to get together in gangs.
[00:18:20.748 --> 00:18:21.889]  Literally stupid scum.
[00:18:22.009 --> 00:18:23.209]  I mean, they're everywhere.
[00:18:24.029 --> 00:18:25.450]  It's white, black, hispanic, everybody.
[00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:26.671]  It's all these victims.
[00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:27.451]  Victimology.
[00:18:27.651 --> 00:18:29.152]  And then they get around and they lie.
[00:18:29.352 --> 00:18:30.952]  They get together and they steal.
[00:18:31.232 --> 00:18:34.294]  They get together and they create all these huge frauds together.
[00:18:34.874 --> 00:18:38.275]  And they try to get in positions of power to then leech off everyone.
[00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:43.618]  And this paradigm has happened time and time and time again in history.
[00:18:44.718 --> 00:18:48.181]  And we are racing towards it, but they want us all fighting with each other low-level.
[00:18:48.221 --> 00:18:57.529]  The technocrats that control the future prediction technologies of Google and all the super science medical advancements and the super weapons, they are breakaway now.
[00:18:57.989 --> 00:19:04.594]  They're just figuring out how to dumb us down, get us in our distraction, get us drugged up, and just phase out the generation.
[00:19:05.555 --> 00:19:06.516]  The soft kill's begun.
[00:19:06.536 --> 00:19:08.597]  They're upping the sterolins in the water, the food.
[00:19:08.877 --> 00:19:09.977]  They're upping the vaccines.
[00:19:09.997 --> 00:19:11.178]  They're upping the glyphosates.
[00:19:11.438 --> 00:19:13.659]  You see all the cancer rates, all the fertility rates.
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.001]  Fertility down, cancer up, everything else up, diabetes up.
[00:19:17.341 --> 00:19:18.402]  I'm not being alarmist.
[00:19:18.522 --> 00:19:19.883]  This is a eugenics plan.
[00:19:20.203 --> 00:19:22.564]  And people warned about Hitler in 33, 35, 38.
[00:19:23.665 --> 00:19:24.925]  People didn't believe about Hitler till 44.
[00:19:27.226 --> 00:19:29.708]  It was a conspiracy theory that he was killing people inside Germany.
[00:19:30.816 --> 00:19:35.658]  It was a conspiracy theory that Stalin had killed 27 million people, but by the 60s we knew, in the 50s we knew.
[00:19:35.678 --> 00:19:49.005]  We're going to go to break, come back here and cover so much more with other anchors and folks popping in, and I'll be back live, Lord willing, in the second hour on the election and this and a lot more.
[00:19:49.505 --> 00:19:52.747]  Stay with us, tell your friends and family to tune in and neighbors, this is a key fight.
[00:19:52.967 --> 00:19:56.909]  This is humanity struggling for freedom, struggling for air, struggling for the surface.
[00:19:57.489 --> 00:19:59.091]  They want to keep us submerged in oppression.
[00:19:59.111 --> 00:20:02.175]  We don't even know there's a surface world of liberty above us, but it's there.
[00:20:02.195 --> 00:20:05.319]  Alright, I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:20:05.339 --> 00:20:08.303]  Please support us, please pray for us, because we are the tip of the spear.

[00:22:41.442 --> 00:22:44.064]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[00:22:44.084 --> 00:22:44.504]  Croix River.
[00:22:44.824 --> 00:22:46.826]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[00:22:47.046 --> 00:22:49.788]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:22:50.028 --> 00:22:50.529]  His excuse?
[00:22:50.889 --> 00:22:51.970]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:53.511]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[00:22:53.831 --> 00:22:59.336]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[00:24:19.805 --> 00:24:21.946]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Wednesday.
[00:24:23.107 --> 00:24:23.907]  This is March.
[00:24:24.207 --> 00:24:34.111]  Wow, moving along pretty quickly and I had a momentary loss of what day it is because I'm very upset about the news that we're going to be talking about here.
[00:24:34.131 --> 00:24:37.913]  We're going to take a look at the LaVoy Finicum murder video that's been put out by the government.
[00:24:39.014 --> 00:24:42.055]  The same day that they say that they are justified in killing him.
[00:24:43.103 --> 00:24:50.527]  They simultaneously release a video that in my opinion and the opinion of many people, we're going to take a look at it, we're going to comment on it.
[00:24:51.387 --> 00:24:53.709]  I want you to see this and hear what we have to say.
[00:24:53.729 --> 00:25:00.713]  To me, this is outright murder and attempted murder and they're doing this right in our face.
[00:25:01.693 --> 00:25:05.175]  Putting this cell phone video out that they had previously confiscated.
[00:25:32.034 --> 00:25:35.015]  The militarization of the police and the police state.
[00:25:35.035 --> 00:25:39.476]  There's a couple of very interesting articles up on the Drudge Report today.
[00:25:39.496 --> 00:25:50.520]  The crime you have not committed, from Bloomberg, talking about the pre-crime minority report type of data mining and flagging that our government is heavily invested into.
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:54.141]  That's what we were talking about a year ago when we were talking about the Jade Helms situation.
[00:25:54.941 --> 00:26:03.126]  We're also going to talk about Ed Snowden calling out the FBI, saying you're lying when you say that you can't unlock the San Bernardino iPhone.
[00:26:03.526 --> 00:26:04.526]  He calls it BS.
[00:26:05.687 --> 00:26:07.668]  And he spells it out for you, okay?
[00:26:07.908 --> 00:26:13.932]  We've also had, of course, John McAfee calling them out on this and saying, look, you can get in this.
[00:26:14.132 --> 00:26:14.832]  I can get in it.
[00:26:15.413 --> 00:26:15.673]  Okay?
[00:26:15.713 --> 00:26:16.913]  It's what John McAfee said.
[00:26:17.594 --> 00:26:18.694]  You don't need to do this.
[00:26:18.714 --> 00:26:21.216]  You're only doing this to establish a legal precedent.
[00:26:22.253 --> 00:26:23.133]  What do we do?
[00:26:24.014 --> 00:26:26.055]  We have a government that lies to us.
[00:26:26.135 --> 00:26:30.858]  And of course, this is part of the investigation into LaVoy Finnegan as well.
[00:26:30.878 --> 00:26:33.199]  And then we're also going to take a look at the election results.
[00:26:33.219 --> 00:26:36.480]  You know, we look at the surprise win of Bernie Sanders in Michigan.
[00:26:37.461 --> 00:26:42.724]  But when you look at the delegates that are sent out, you know, even when Bernie wins, he loses.
[00:26:43.764 --> 00:26:44.665]  That's by design.
[00:26:45.538 --> 00:26:47.039]  There's an article up on Politico.
[00:26:47.079 --> 00:26:52.444]  It's like, hey, you know, if we had Democrat rules in the Republican Party, we could easily stop Donald Trump.
[00:26:53.866 --> 00:27:04.655]  Maybe the Democrats need to start a grassroots effort to make sure that the party elites don't get to trump what the grassroots voters want.
[00:27:05.556 --> 00:27:11.100]  Hopefully that won't happen in the GOP elections, but we need to have a major reform of this.
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.803]  People need to see the corruption in both parties.
[00:27:14.043 --> 00:27:15.885]  We need to have some choices here.
[00:27:16.545 --> 00:27:17.306]  That's right.
[00:27:31.847 --> 00:27:36.193]  It's the climate treaties, it's the open borders, it's the globalist consolidation.
[00:27:36.274 --> 00:27:38.477]  It takes place first, economically.
[00:27:38.777 --> 00:27:41.721]  But there are also sovereignty issues with this at the very beginning.
[00:27:41.942 --> 00:27:47.369]  And they will use that economic consolidation to create a political consolidation as well.
[00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:55.132]  Before we get to the news, I just want to let you know that we do have Supermail Vitality back in stock.
[00:27:55.352 --> 00:27:57.113]  It's been out of stock for a very long time.
[00:27:57.153 --> 00:28:00.114]  It is now back in stock for a limited time only.
[00:28:00.394 --> 00:28:05.816]  You know, one of the reasons that this stuff goes out of stock is because of auto ship and high demand.
[00:28:05.896 --> 00:28:10.558]  And you know, one of the ways that you can guarantee that it's never going to go out of stock for you is to get into auto ship.
[00:28:10.998 --> 00:28:12.659]  And that also gives you a 10% discount.
[00:28:13.899 --> 00:28:16.240]  Whenever you buy anything at Infowarslife.com.
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:25.082]  So you can make sure that you get the products that you want on the time frame that you want when you sign up for AutoShip and you get 10% off all the time.
[00:28:25.142 --> 00:28:29.503]  So you can pick the interval at which you want it shipped and make sure that you always have it.
[00:28:29.523 --> 00:28:36.045]  So right now we have Supermail Vitality that is back in stock and one of the ways that you can make sure you don't run out is with AutoShip.
[00:28:36.765 --> 00:28:38.626]  And that's at Infowarslife.com.
[00:28:38.646 --> 00:28:42.327]  Now let's quickly take a look at what the elites are doing and what they were not able to do.
[00:28:43.479 --> 00:28:49.043]  Mitt Romney, of course, did us all a favor by coming out against Donald Trump.
[00:28:49.603 --> 00:29:01.831]  It seems that whenever the elites go out and unite in opposition to somebody, that is the kiss of death for the people they support, and it is a big boost for Donald Trump, who they do not support.
[00:29:02.292 --> 00:29:07.315]  The never-say-Trump people are not helping themselves.
[00:29:07.495 --> 00:29:12.343]  Every time they identify somebody as the establishment candidate, that candidate implodes.
[00:29:12.924 --> 00:29:13.986]  We've seen it time and again.
[00:29:14.006 --> 00:29:21.638]  And so what we saw with this election that we had last night was Mitt Romney recorded robocalls on the behalf of Marco Rubato.
[00:29:22.808 --> 00:29:25.651]  And also on behalf of Kasich in Michigan.
[00:29:25.951 --> 00:29:27.353]  He did it in all four states.
[00:29:28.074 --> 00:29:30.196]  He did pro-Rubio calls Mitt Romney.
[00:29:30.757 --> 00:29:32.138]  What is the matter with Mitt Romney?
[00:29:32.899 --> 00:29:34.521]  He ran for president for eight years.
[00:29:35.101 --> 00:29:41.348]  He was rejected by the Republicans and he was rejected by everybody when the Republicans finally gave up and said, all right, give him a run at it.
[00:29:41.808 --> 00:29:42.069]  Okay?
[00:29:42.289 --> 00:29:42.930]  He doesn't get it.
[00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:44.591]  Nobody likes Mitt Romney.
[00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:46.252]  He lost his home state to Obama.
[00:29:46.272 --> 00:29:50.596]  One of the only reasons he won it in the primaries is because he got an endorsement from Donald Trump.
[00:29:50.616 --> 00:29:55.840]  The guy is an incredible loser to borrow Donald Trump's points, and he proved it last night.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.240]  Stay with us.
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.821]  We'll be right back to talk about this video.
[00:29:58.362 --> 00:29:59.242]  We're on the march.
[00:29:59.743 --> 00:30:01.324]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.265 --> 00:30:04.947]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.273 --> 00:30:09.793]  400 U.S.
[00:30:09.853 --> 00:30:22.558]  Army soldiers at Fort Gordon, Georgia, were subjected to a so-called white privilege briefing, including a PowerPoint presentation instructing the attendees, our society attaches privilege to being white and male and heterosexual.
[00:30:22.738 --> 00:30:30.721]  The slideshow obtained by Judicial Watch also informed the soldiers, quote, race privilege gives whites little reason to pay a lot of attention to African Americans.
[00:30:31.041 --> 00:30:38.744]  The white privilege training also claimed there are unspecified powerful forces everywhere, keeping different kinds of people from being valued, accepted, and appreciated.
[00:30:39.004 --> 00:30:40.924]  But we act as if it doesn't exist.
[00:30:41.205 --> 00:30:46.206]  This alleged privilege creates a yawning divide in income, wealth, and dignity, the slideshow suggested.
[00:30:46.546 --> 00:30:52.068]  But obviously, this white privilege training course helps perpetrate this racial divide in America by fueling racial tensions.
[00:30:52.288 --> 00:30:56.970]  This very notion that you can group people into racial groups who have certain privileges is racist in itself,
[00:30:57.110 --> 00:31:02.358]  Because then you're not looking at people by their individual qualities, but rather by their skin color, which is inherently racist.
[00:31:02.698 --> 00:31:06.624]  This is Kit Daniels and check back at InfoWars.com for more news and reports.

[00:32:19.232 --> 00:32:20.714]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:32:20.734 --> 00:32:22.356]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:32:22.676 --> 00:32:23.737]  I feel like I look better.
[00:32:23.777 --> 00:32:24.438]  I feel better.
[00:32:24.498 --> 00:32:25.519]  I feel sexier.
[00:32:25.539 --> 00:32:26.260]  I love it.

[00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:22.271]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:33:22.831 --> 00:33:26.493]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:31.815 --> 00:33:33.137]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:33.237 --> 00:33:33.977]  I'm David Knight.
[00:33:34.378 --> 00:33:41.025]  On this Wednesday, March 9th, 2016, we're going to take a look at this LaVoy Finicum murder video.
[00:33:42.287 --> 00:33:43.468]  We put this up last night.
[00:33:43.488 --> 00:33:45.450]  The article on Infowars.com.
[00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:50.275]  Shock cell phone video shows a LaVoy Finicum shooting from inside the video.
[00:33:50.335 --> 00:33:51.577]  This video was released...
[00:33:52.324 --> 00:33:54.865]  By the Deschutes County Sheriff's Office.
[00:33:54.885 --> 00:33:58.827]  This is the county sheriff's office that is doing the investigation.
[00:33:59.448 --> 00:34:06.211]  They do it in a different county whenever it takes place in a neighboring county.
[00:34:06.251 --> 00:34:09.953]  They don't have the same sheriff's office investigate this.
[00:34:10.013 --> 00:34:11.233]  But let's understand, okay?
[00:34:11.313 --> 00:34:12.214]  This is the FBI.
[00:34:12.374 --> 00:34:14.195]  This is the state police.
[00:34:14.775 --> 00:34:18.337]  These are people who are essentially investigating themselves, okay?
[00:34:18.957 --> 00:34:23.419]  This is not a jury of impartial citizens looking at this investigation.
[00:34:23.919 --> 00:34:29.142]  This is the government investigating itself and pronouncing itself justified.
[00:34:30.182 --> 00:34:30.723]  Justified.
[00:34:31.083 --> 00:34:40.907]  And we're going to take a look at this, because if you saw our comments last night, you know that when we looked at this, and every time I look at this, it makes me more angry.
[00:34:41.828 --> 00:34:42.408]  And heartbroken.
[00:34:43.968 --> 00:34:44.628]  This is murder.
[00:34:45.249 --> 00:34:47.089]  This is our government shooting people down.
[00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:48.670]  We've seen this in the inner cities.
[00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:50.551]  We've seen it with black people.
[00:34:50.751 --> 00:34:51.852]  We've seen it with white people.
[00:34:51.892 --> 00:34:55.013]  We've seen it with people in the cities, people in the countryside, okay?
[00:34:55.853 --> 00:34:59.995]  Until we all come together, black and white, cowboy and Indian, and stop these abuses.
[00:35:00.035 --> 00:35:01.536]  And I don't want to say cowboy and Indian.
[00:35:01.576 --> 00:35:05.478]  I mean, really, when you look at what's going on in Arizona with Senator McCain.
[00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:16.417]  Turning over this land, taking this land that is something that's being used for recreation, but it also has significant historical aspects to the Apache Indians that are there.
[00:35:16.437 --> 00:35:22.801]  They're going to destroy this land on which some cowboys, if you want to call them that, ranchers or others have surface rights to.
[00:35:22.841 --> 00:35:32.328]  It has multiple uses at this point, but it's going to be turned over to a foreign corporation to mine it for copper in a way that will destroy it for everyone.
[00:35:32.828 --> 00:35:40.178]  No recreational use, no historical use, no religious significance for the Indians, no surface rights for the Americans.
[00:35:40.239 --> 00:35:43.263]  It'll be a foreign corporation that will mine and destroy this.
[00:35:43.283 --> 00:35:44.585]  We have to stand up to this.
[00:35:45.306 --> 00:35:49.111]  That is what's behind this issue that these people were protesting.
[00:35:49.952 --> 00:35:55.135]  But we also have to stand up to the violence that our government enacts on people of every kind.
[00:35:55.315 --> 00:36:04.600]  We have to stand together and we have to say that you're not going to break us into little groups and pit us against each other like the Black Lives Matter issue, okay?
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.540]  This is a real BLM issue.
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:08.481]  It's a BLM Bureau of Land Management.
[00:36:08.561 --> 00:36:14.342]  It's also transcending the Black Lives Matter propaganda of George Soros and others.
[00:36:14.362 --> 00:36:19.763]  And we've had videos and reports where we show you how George Soros is funding that, okay?
[00:36:19.883 --> 00:36:21.844]  That is an effort to shut it down.
[00:36:22.064 --> 00:36:28.025]  That is an effort to get us fighting amongst ourselves instead of joining together to stop these kind of murders.
[00:36:28.265 --> 00:36:29.786]  Now, what I want you to do
[00:36:30.566 --> 00:36:35.650]  When you look at this, I don't want you to jump onto social media and start making death threats, okay?
[00:36:36.931 --> 00:36:41.995]  If you see this and you understand what is going on and it makes you angry, do not take yourself out of the game.
[00:36:45.637 --> 00:36:50.261]  If you're outraged, we need you educated people.
[00:36:53.323 --> 00:36:55.985]  Don't go out and shoot somebody in uniform either, okay?
[00:36:56.005 --> 00:36:57.086]  You're gonna shoot the wrong person.
[00:36:59.653 --> 00:37:01.134]  You're going to shed innocent blood.
[00:37:01.174 --> 00:37:03.535]  We don't need to make these killers into heroes.
[00:37:03.855 --> 00:37:06.537]  We don't need to justify their actions after the fact.
[00:37:10.819 --> 00:37:11.959]  We've got to educate the public.
[00:37:12.059 --> 00:37:14.081]  We've got to stop this murder.
[00:37:16.242 --> 00:37:17.622]  Let's take a look at this video.
[00:37:18.063 --> 00:37:19.964]  I want you to see what happened at the stop.
[00:37:20.004 --> 00:37:22.005]  And what they did was they took the cell phone video.
[00:37:22.779 --> 00:37:27.321]  And they superimposed it on this ridiculous video that we've been given by the FBI.
[00:37:27.761 --> 00:37:40.985]  What the FBI gave us was aerial footage at a very low resolution, with no sound, and a phony lying narrative from the FBI shill who was presenting this.
[00:37:41.305 --> 00:37:42.666]  When Biggs and I saw this,
[00:37:44.357 --> 00:37:48.163]  And the FBI agent, to give you an example of how effective it is, I mean, we should have known better.
[00:37:48.183 --> 00:37:56.517]  We looked at this and it's like, you know, it's a shaky video, it's not streaming well, we got the FBI saying, you know, it's approaching the roadblock.
[00:37:57.455 --> 00:38:00.716]  The FBI agent says, look at this, he tried to run down our agent.
[00:38:00.796 --> 00:38:04.356]  And it's like, oh, look, we could see a guy halfway there because it was a jerky video.
[00:38:04.376 --> 00:38:07.257]  And then we went back and looked at it, it's like this guy leapt out in front of him.
[00:38:07.997 --> 00:38:11.718]  He's swerving off to the side, trying to avoid the roadblock that they put up.
[00:38:11.758 --> 00:38:14.939]  And of course, we're going to talk about the legal aspects of that roadblock.
[00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:17.099]  But he's swerving to the side to miss that roadblock.
[00:38:17.119 --> 00:38:22.260]  And as he's swerving, the guy jumps out in front of his truck and he swerves farther to the left.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.041]  He was not trying to run the guy down.
[00:38:24.301 --> 00:38:25.401]  Everything about this.
[00:38:26.081 --> 00:38:30.383]  Was designed as a propaganda lie by the FBI.
[00:38:30.423 --> 00:38:39.508]  So now when they say, well, okay, the shooting was justified, but we're going to investigate some FBI agents who lied about the fact that they didn't shoot any guns, okay?
[00:38:39.848 --> 00:38:42.289]  Look, the whole thing was a lie.
[00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:44.551]  The whole thing was an ambush.
[00:38:44.631 --> 00:38:48.893]  The whole thing was set up to stop a political protest.
[00:38:48.913 --> 00:38:52.195]  They were going to talk to 400 people in John Day, Oregon.
[00:38:53.075 --> 00:38:54.636]  People who understood what the problems were.
[00:38:54.696 --> 00:38:57.276]  People who are going to try to address this peacefully.
[00:38:57.556 --> 00:38:58.577]  And I hope they still do.
[00:38:59.237 --> 00:39:01.477]  I hope they don't let this scare them into silence.
[00:39:01.558 --> 00:39:02.458]  It has to be addressed.
[00:39:03.098 --> 00:39:07.879]  These are issues that the sheriff in Grant County, Sheriff Palmer, had stood with the people on.
[00:39:08.299 --> 00:39:10.640]  He had deputized people to try to deal with it.
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.141]  Other people in the government shut it down.
[00:39:12.181 --> 00:39:14.581]  We need more people like Sheriff Palmer.
[00:39:15.802 --> 00:39:17.102]  There are good people in government.
[00:39:17.762 --> 00:39:20.363]  Don't start striking out blindly against people.
[00:39:23.171 --> 00:39:26.295]  Let's play this, you can see, we're going to play this in a couple of clips.
[00:39:26.395 --> 00:39:27.676]  It's very long, it's 12 minutes long.
[00:39:28.157 --> 00:39:34.144]  Let's play it where they're stopped and you can hear their confusion, how they're trying to deal with what they don't understand.
[00:39:34.164 --> 00:39:41.293]  They're not being allowed, they were allowed to travel freely back and forth, talking to people, having political meetings, explaining what the problems were.
[00:39:42.253 --> 00:39:43.334]  The FBI didn't want that.
[00:39:43.874 --> 00:39:49.978]  Because they were having pressure put on them by the state and the federal officials to shut that down.
[00:39:50.619 --> 00:39:51.279]  And they shut it down.
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:52.060]  They shut it down.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.501]  Killed and arrested people.
[00:39:53.841 --> 00:39:55.542]  Let's show the first stop right here.
[00:39:55.562 --> 00:39:57.884]  Shoot me?
[00:39:58.144 --> 00:39:58.885]  You shoot me!
[00:39:59.565 --> 00:40:00.686]  I'm gonna meet the sheriff?
[00:40:01.026 --> 00:40:02.307]  The sheriff is waiting for us!
[00:40:03.088 --> 00:40:04.709]  So you do as you damn well please!
[00:40:05.369 --> 00:40:06.310]  But I'm not going anywhere!
[00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:07.331]  Here I am!
[00:40:07.811 --> 00:40:08.331]  Right there!
[00:40:09.192 --> 00:40:09.672]  Right there!
[00:40:09.692 --> 00:40:11.554]  He's holding his hands out the window.
[00:40:12.395 --> 00:40:13.116]  You understand?
[00:40:13.756 --> 00:40:14.917]  I'm going to go meet the sheriff!
[00:40:15.477 --> 00:40:17.259]  You back down or you kill me now!
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:19.461]  Go ahead!
[00:40:19.881 --> 00:40:20.802]  Put the bullet through me!
[00:40:23.143 --> 00:40:24.485]  He knows what they're trying to do.
[00:40:25.025 --> 00:40:25.645]  I don't care!
[00:40:25.846 --> 00:40:26.346]  Where's Ryan?
[00:40:26.626 --> 00:40:27.807]  I'm going to go meet the sheriff!
[00:40:27.827 --> 00:40:29.789]  Now, mainstream media says he's taunting them.
[00:40:29.869 --> 00:40:32.191]  No, he's telling them, I'm going to go meet the sheriff.
[00:40:32.331 --> 00:40:33.371]  I'm going to meet the sheriff.
[00:40:34.072 --> 00:40:36.074]  You can either come with me or you can shoot me right now.
[00:40:36.094 --> 00:40:36.434]  What for?
[00:40:37.154 --> 00:40:39.016]  Well, I'm going to ask them if they want to go out!
[00:40:39.236 --> 00:40:39.736]  What for?
[00:40:39.877 --> 00:40:40.557]  Why are we getting out?
[00:40:40.577 --> 00:40:41.298]  You want out?
[00:40:41.338 --> 00:40:41.538]  What for?
[00:40:42.316 --> 00:40:44.537]  What are we getting at?
[00:40:44.577 --> 00:40:45.497]  Who are you?
[00:40:45.537 --> 00:40:47.318]  Yeah, who are you?
[00:40:47.458 --> 00:40:48.298]  Who are you?
[00:40:51.739 --> 00:40:52.619]  Oregon State Police.
[00:40:52.639 --> 00:40:56.040]  Okay, well I'm going over to meet the sheriff in Grant County.
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.521]  You can come along with us.
[00:40:57.781 --> 00:40:59.181]  The new topless is over there.
[00:41:01.062 --> 00:41:02.322]  You can go ahead and shoot me.
[00:41:02.682 --> 00:41:03.902]  Put the laser right there.
[00:41:04.163 --> 00:41:05.403]  Put the bullet through the head.
[00:41:06.388 --> 00:41:10.431]  And as he's doing this, you can see the red dots inside the cabin of the truck.
[00:41:10.731 --> 00:41:12.813]  They're already training and pointing their guns at them.
[00:41:13.633 --> 00:41:17.396]  That's assault, folks, with a deadly weapon.
[00:41:17.416 --> 00:41:18.276]  Okay.
[00:41:20.418 --> 00:41:24.841]  Now, we're going to pick this up, and we're going to, at one point, he says, all right, we're going to go.
[00:41:24.861 --> 00:41:27.283]  They talk about it amongst themselves and say, let's just go.
[00:41:27.463 --> 00:41:30.345]  Let's try to get to the sheriff in Grant County.
[00:41:30.385 --> 00:41:32.927]  The sheriff was going to be at that meeting of 400 people.
[00:41:32.967 --> 00:41:34.128]  He was going to be addressing them.
[00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:36.410]  So they drive off.
[00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:38.931]  Now I want you to see what happens next.
[00:41:39.011 --> 00:41:44.934]  Before I do that, I want to read you something that came from Oath Keepers after the fact.
[00:41:45.114 --> 00:41:48.115]  This was something Stuart Rhodes interviewed.
[00:41:49.221 --> 00:41:52.804]  Greg McWhirter, a veteran SWAT officer, an oath keeper.
[00:41:52.824 --> 00:41:56.427]  And we've also had a video, we looked for this video, couldn't find it before showtime.
[00:41:56.827 --> 00:42:06.995]  We've had another officer who put a video up and he said, you don't set up a roadblock like this because that in and of itself is a use of deadly force.
[00:42:07.575 --> 00:42:13.100]  And so in this interview with Stuart Rhodes, this officer, who is another veteran police officer,
[00:42:14.048 --> 00:42:15.552]  Quotes the law here.
[00:42:15.672 --> 00:42:17.717]  He says vehicle pursuits.
[00:42:17.758 --> 00:42:19.943]  This is a Portland Police Department's policy.
[00:42:19.983 --> 00:42:22.590]  This is Oregon State Police policy that he quotes here.
[00:42:24.153 --> 00:42:25.854]  630.05 Vehicle Pursuits.
[00:42:26.454 --> 00:42:27.055]  Barricading.
[00:42:27.115 --> 00:42:31.757]  Barricading is considered deadly physical force, subject to Directive 1010.10.
[00:42:32.357 --> 00:42:34.779]  Barricading requires the approval of a supervisor.
[00:42:34.959 --> 00:42:45.384]  Furthermore, the barricade must be set up in such a manner as to avoid the fleeing suspect, to afford the fleeing suspect ample time to see the barricade, to stop his or her vehicle.
[00:42:45.484 --> 00:42:47.185]  They put it around a curve, and you can see this.
[00:42:47.905 --> 00:42:54.267]  Boxing in, ramming and roadblocks boxing in and ramming to be used only against violent felons.
[00:42:55.048 --> 00:43:01.710]  With permission by sworn supervisor monitoring the pursuit not to be used by officers who have not completed prescribed training.
[00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:04.931]  Roadblocks are dangerous and difficult to properly establish.
[00:43:05.252 --> 00:43:10.073]  No roadblock may be established until both dispatcher and pursuing officer have been notified.
[00:43:10.373 --> 00:43:11.694]  There are three kinds of roadblocks.
[00:43:12.054 --> 00:43:16.655]  Fixed, which a block road to extent that little or no outlet remains.
[00:43:16.756 --> 00:43:20.237]  A fixed roadblocks are extremely dangerous and are rarely justifiable.
[00:43:20.257 --> 00:43:21.117]  And that's what we have here.
[00:43:21.397 --> 00:43:28.739]  That is quoting Oregon State Police policy, which they violated in this particular situation.
[00:43:28.799 --> 00:43:33.601]  As the other officer in his analysis of this said, they know who these people were.
[00:43:34.201 --> 00:43:35.441]  They know they're not violent.
[00:43:35.742 --> 00:43:38.722]  They talked to them for probably 10 minutes.
[00:43:38.802 --> 00:43:40.623]  They could see them holding their hands out.
[00:43:40.723 --> 00:43:43.124]  Nothing was done that would indicate that they were violent.
[00:43:43.944 --> 00:43:44.224]  Okay?
[00:43:45.325 --> 00:43:46.065]  They knew who they were.
[00:43:46.105 --> 00:43:47.245]  They knew where they were going.
[00:43:48.165 --> 00:43:53.347]  And there was absolutely no reason for them to use deadly force.
[00:43:53.507 --> 00:43:56.208]  And the blockade itself was deadly force.
[00:43:56.228 --> 00:43:57.328]  But they didn't just stop there.
[00:43:58.229 --> 00:43:59.289]  Let's roll this video.
[00:43:59.329 --> 00:44:02.050]  And you can see that as they're pulling up to the roadblock,
[00:44:03.252 --> 00:44:09.277]  They're approaching the roadblock, and the police and the FBI start shooting at them as they're approaching the roadblock.
[00:44:09.617 --> 00:44:10.438]  It got that bad.
[00:44:10.478 --> 00:44:11.299]  Let's show that video.
[00:44:11.319 --> 00:44:14.821]  Okay, I don't know about numbers.
[00:44:15.122 --> 00:44:18.064]  Well, I got numbers, but I can't call because we have no service.
[00:44:18.624 --> 00:44:18.864]  Okay.
[00:44:18.945 --> 00:44:21.046]  Yeah, they set it up there where you've got no service.
[00:44:21.987 --> 00:44:27.051]  Do you have numbers for people here in town?
[00:44:27.091 --> 00:44:27.211]  Yeah.
[00:44:27.251 --> 00:44:27.491]  Hang on.
[00:44:27.511 --> 00:44:28.132]  Okay, they're shooting.
[00:44:28.412 --> 00:44:28.732]  Hang on.
[00:44:28.792 --> 00:44:29.653]  Come right around the video.
[00:44:30.153 --> 00:44:31.414]  Come right around the curve, and they do that.
[00:44:33.334 --> 00:44:36.397]  Stay down, stay down, stay down.
[00:44:37.358 --> 00:44:44.385]  They're saying stay down, hold it right there, hold it right there.
[00:44:48.365 --> 00:44:50.446]  Okay, I was talking, you can hear the gunshots.
[00:44:50.486 --> 00:44:54.188]  You can hear, if you watch the video, you can hear the gunshots as they're approaching the barricade.
[00:44:54.608 --> 00:44:57.009]  When you look at that video, he says, go ahead and shoot me.
[00:44:57.069 --> 00:44:59.930]  He got out of the car right away because they had already been shooting at him.
[00:45:00.351 --> 00:45:00.611]  Okay?
[00:45:00.931 --> 00:45:03.972]  He's trying to draw fire away from the people in the car, I believe.
[00:45:04.332 --> 00:45:06.934]  That's what his family and the people who knew him believe.
[00:45:07.954 --> 00:45:08.794]  He was that kind of guy.
[00:45:08.814 --> 00:45:10.515]  He was that kind of guy.
[00:45:10.955 --> 00:45:11.916]  He died for your freedoms.
[00:45:13.291 --> 00:45:20.935]  Now, as he's getting out of the car, with his hands raised, you can see them shooting out the windows, shooting at him.
[00:45:21.836 --> 00:45:22.116]  Okay?
[00:45:22.937 --> 00:45:24.177]  I don't know if they shot him at that point.
[00:45:24.197 --> 00:45:26.479]  They say that all the shots were in his back.
[00:45:27.019 --> 00:45:27.539]  In his back.
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:29.080]  That's our government.
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:31.722]  Our lying, back-shooting government.
[00:45:32.122 --> 00:45:35.123]  And we need to change it, not start shooting people, folks.
[00:45:36.024 --> 00:45:39.066]  We do not want to become what we fight.
[00:45:39.546 --> 00:45:41.247]  That's what we talk about with this torture video.
[00:45:41.267 --> 00:45:42.928]  That's what we try to explain to Donald Trump.
[00:45:44.332 --> 00:45:46.453]  You do not want to become what you fight.
[00:45:46.493 --> 00:45:49.896]  And of course he said, look, I'm not going to torture people if it's against the law.
[00:45:49.916 --> 00:45:50.836]  He said that on Friday.
[00:45:50.856 --> 00:45:56.140]  Then on Sunday, he gets on with John Dickerson and he says, well, you know, we got a set of rules that are hampering us.
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:57.741]  They don't play by the rules.
[00:45:57.801 --> 00:46:04.065]  And John Dickerson said, so the rules really are what separate us from them, what makes us better than them.
[00:46:05.305 --> 00:46:08.046]  And he goes, oh, we have to get to their level, we have to win.
[00:46:08.086 --> 00:46:09.766]  No, we cannot think that way.
[00:46:10.266 --> 00:46:12.727]  We cannot become what we fight.
[00:46:12.967 --> 00:46:15.288]  That is always the danger of a war.
[00:46:16.748 --> 00:46:20.269]  And let's understand, this is a war of our government against the American people.
[00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:21.810]  There's no doubt about that.
[00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:23.990]  But we do not want to become them.
[00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:30.732]  If we start resorting to murder and vigilantism, we're going to exchange one kind of tyranny for another.
[00:46:32.352 --> 00:46:34.073]  We need to wake people up.
[00:46:34.912 --> 00:46:40.276]  The vast majority of people in this country, and you have to understand this, do not share your anger at this.
[00:46:41.477 --> 00:46:42.778]  They have to be angry about this.
[00:46:42.798 --> 00:46:44.259]  They have to understand what's going on.
[00:46:45.641 --> 00:46:49.364]  Black people in the cities are angry about it, but they think that it's just them.
[00:46:49.384 --> 00:46:51.465]  They have to understand.
[00:46:51.826 --> 00:46:52.506]  Show them this.
[00:46:53.667 --> 00:46:55.649]  Tell them you agree with their problems.
[00:46:55.729 --> 00:46:59.231]  Tell them that we need to work with ways to shut this down.
[00:46:59.271 --> 00:47:03.155]  But before we can do anything, before we can do anything,
[00:47:04.039 --> 00:47:06.042]  We have to have a consensus.
[00:47:06.463 --> 00:47:08.246]  We have to have a larger number of people.
[00:47:08.727 --> 00:47:10.891]  And that's one of the lessons of this Oregon standoff.
[00:47:11.672 --> 00:47:12.934]  It's not enough to be right.
[00:47:14.056 --> 00:47:15.038]  It's not enough to be right.
[00:47:15.378 --> 00:47:15.999]  You cannot...
[00:47:17.216 --> 00:47:19.957]  Do something like they did in Oregon with just a couple of people.
[00:47:19.997 --> 00:47:22.798]  It was a bad strategy, a bad tactic.
[00:47:22.838 --> 00:47:29.880]  They thought they had broader support because they had some shill reporter that was lying to them and provoking them to do this stuff.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.821]  They did not have the kind of national support that they thought.
[00:47:33.401 --> 00:47:40.843]  They thought they could go anywhere and defend people who were being attacked by the government and Oregon is probably the worst place to take your stand.
[00:47:41.483 --> 00:47:43.804]  One of the most statist places that you can go to.
[00:47:45.034 --> 00:47:47.295]  We have to use the law that they swear to.
[00:47:48.975 --> 00:47:50.656]  They swear to the Constitution.
[00:47:51.416 --> 00:47:55.218]  The Constitution is the beard they use to give them the authority that they have.
[00:47:56.078 --> 00:47:59.839]  And we have to make it clear that they are the criminals.
[00:48:00.799 --> 00:48:03.900]  But we have to get the American people to understand this.
[00:48:04.481 --> 00:48:10.683]  And when we look at the articles that are put out by the Washington Post, by the New York Times, the way they slant the news,
[00:48:11.749 --> 00:48:18.093]  You have to understand that we're a long way from getting the people to come together and oppose this across the board.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:20.414]  This is absolutely amazing.
[00:48:20.434 --> 00:48:21.815]  Let me read you some of the articles.
[00:48:21.855 --> 00:48:24.376]  Let me read you first what the Oregon Live said.
[00:48:25.237 --> 00:48:29.920]  They said, an FBI agent is suspected of lying about firing twice at LaVoy Finicum, okay?
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:34.103]  They say that two state troopers shot him three times in the back.
[00:48:34.203 --> 00:48:35.164]  Shows an autopsy.
[00:48:35.805 --> 00:48:39.748]  Finnicombe had a trooper in front of him armed with a taser who was thought to be endangered.
[00:48:39.788 --> 00:48:45.754]  Of course, when we analyzed this with that other officer, he said, here's a car they're using deadly force against.
[00:48:46.826 --> 00:48:55.253]  And what you would typically, legally, only, we just read what the Oregon State Police policy is, you would only use that against fleeing violent felons, okay?
[00:48:55.273 --> 00:48:56.654]  That's not the situation here.
[00:48:57.315 --> 00:49:06.703]  They set up deadly force with the roadblock, and then he jumps out as if there's no threat from this vehicle that they have just used deadly force to stop.
[00:49:08.164 --> 00:49:13.648]  He jumps out and stands behind that vehicle, exposing himself to being attacked from the vehicle they were just shooting at.
[00:49:14.414 --> 00:49:16.776]  The vehicle they just used deadly force to stop.
[00:49:17.677 --> 00:49:26.404]  And then once they kill LaVoy Finicum, they retreat back to their covered positions, and they continue to fire at the people in the car.
[00:49:26.424 --> 00:49:27.385]  Let's play that video.
[00:49:28.906 --> 00:49:29.907]  Let's keep rolling that video.
[00:49:32.509 --> 00:49:38.715]  Stay down, stay down, stay down.
[00:49:39.355 --> 00:49:40.416]  They're saying stay down.
[00:49:42.233 --> 00:49:42.613]  Stay down.
[00:49:44.475 --> 00:49:47.818]  Are they shooting him?
[00:49:48.298 --> 00:49:48.919]  Did they shoot him?
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:50.320]  Stay down.
[00:49:51.882 --> 00:49:53.423]  Are you hit?
[00:50:04.514 --> 00:50:09.618]  Now they retreat to their positions and you'll see that they're hitting them with tear gas.
[00:50:10.178 --> 00:50:13.060]  They're hitting them, they're shining bullets there, they're shooting at them.
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:17.423]  You can see the tear gas, the flash bangs going off as they're shooting at them.
[00:50:18.283 --> 00:50:20.185]  This goes on for a very long time.
[00:50:20.625 --> 00:50:21.646]  You should watch this video.
[00:50:21.666 --> 00:50:25.028]  You need to make sure other people watch this video.
[00:50:25.769 --> 00:50:27.270]  Now we can see what's going on.
[00:50:28.641 --> 00:50:33.925]  Like we couldn't when the FBI put that video out initially, and they did it that way so that you would not see what's going on.
[00:50:34.165 --> 00:50:38.748]  Now they're trying to get rid of the sheriff in Grant County because he called it an ambush.
[00:50:38.868 --> 00:50:40.209]  Folks, it was an ambush.
[00:50:40.709 --> 00:50:45.572]  It violated Oregon state policy, but now the Oregon police say, oh, it's justified.
[00:50:45.953 --> 00:50:46.553]  Justified.
[00:50:46.973 --> 00:50:54.919]  We set up the rules, we can break the rules, just like the GOP and the Democrats will do when it comes to their conventions.
[00:50:55.419 --> 00:51:02.786]  We'll talk about that, but we're going to talk more about what happened in this murder, an attempted murder of the three people in the vehicle.
[00:51:03.366 --> 00:51:04.307]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:51:09.371 --> 00:51:11.033]  This is not an offering to sell a franchise.
[00:51:11.113 --> 00:51:13.475]  Franchise offerings are made through the Franchise Disclosure Document.
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:17.164]  Are you one of the 70% of Americans who hate their jobs?
[00:51:17.464 --> 00:51:19.806]  Do you wish you could work for yourself but don't know what to do?
[00:51:20.107 --> 00:51:21.908]  Then we have a proven solution for you.
[00:51:21.928 --> 00:51:24.311]  A budget blinds franchise opportunity.

[00:51:56.127 --> 00:51:58.989]  But hurry, franchise opportunities in this area are limited.
[00:51:59.009 --> 00:51:59.229]  Call 1-800-215-3334.
[00:51:59.249 --> 00:51:59.529]  That's 1-800-215-3334.
[00:51:59.549 --> 00:51:59.609]  1-800-215-3334.
[00:52:10.476 --> 00:52:13.898]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:52:14.239 --> 00:52:21.363]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:52:21.984 --> 00:52:30.249]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:34.752]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:52:35.033 --> 00:52:40.196]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vocational
[00:52:40.596 --> 00:52:44.459]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:52:44.839 --> 00:52:47.942]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[00:52:48.262 --> 00:52:59.350]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:02.072]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[00:53:02.312 --> 00:53:08.297]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at Infowarslife.com with AnthroPlex.
[00:53:08.897 --> 00:53:12.378]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:53:13.119 --> 00:53:13.639]  It's true.
[00:53:13.759 --> 00:53:17.700]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:19.761]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:53:20.301 --> 00:53:24.763]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[00:53:25.083 --> 00:53:37.699]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.
[00:53:37.959 --> 00:53:41.464]  Big Berkey Water Filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[00:53:41.744 --> 00:53:44.024]  The gold standard in water purification.
[00:53:44.405 --> 00:53:48.425]  And our filters last for years at less than two cents per gallon.
[00:53:48.705 --> 00:53:49.325]  Big Berkey.
[00:53:49.525 --> 00:53:53.026]  The one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[00:53:53.226 --> 00:53:54.826]  Get your Big Berkey today.
[00:53:54.987 --> 00:53:57.307]  Call 1-877-99-BERKEY or click BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[00:53:57.367 --> 00:53:57.967]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[00:53:58.107 --> 00:53:59.367]  Big Berkey Water Filters.
[00:53:59.427 --> 00:54:00.488]  For the love of clean water.
[00:54:15.726 --> 00:54:17.066]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:17.106 --> 00:54:18.247]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:54:18.267 --> 00:54:28.169]  I want to continue with this murder of a boy, and the attempted murder of the three people in that car, because the police continued to shoot at that vehicle for quite some time.
[00:54:28.689 --> 00:54:30.829]  Nobody shot back at that point in time.
[00:54:30.909 --> 00:54:38.591]  You know, it was... I just cannot understand how you justify shooting somebody with their hands up as they're executing a vehicle.
[00:54:38.651 --> 00:54:43.552]  We've seen this many times in inner cities, and the police continually get away with it because they investigate themselves.
[00:54:44.312 --> 00:54:45.352]  They exonerate themselves.
[00:54:46.226 --> 00:54:48.747]  The legal system is fundamentally broken.
[00:54:48.767 --> 00:54:50.588]  It doesn't exist.
[00:54:50.628 --> 00:54:51.468]  We have to reclaim it.
[00:54:52.529 --> 00:54:54.169]  We have to reclaim juries.
[00:54:54.229 --> 00:54:55.850]  There's a lot of things that we can do.
[00:54:55.930 --> 00:55:00.672]  We do not start with vigilantism, no matter how much this upsets you.
[00:55:00.712 --> 00:55:05.274]  And I know that many of you are upset about this, but most of the people in America have not seen this.
[00:55:06.112 --> 00:55:06.972]  I've got other comments.
[00:55:07.012 --> 00:55:11.153]  I want to remind you first that we do have Supermail Vitality back in stock.
[00:55:11.873 --> 00:55:13.254]  Get yours before it sells out.
[00:55:13.294 --> 00:55:15.414]  And again, this is the way we support our operation here.
[00:55:15.954 --> 00:55:19.475]  Supermail Vitality back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:55:20.335 --> 00:55:21.876]  Has hundreds of five-star reviews.
[00:55:21.916 --> 00:55:23.996]  You can see those at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:55:24.036 --> 00:55:28.217]  You can read them for yourself, see what people say that is done for them, how it has helped them.
[00:55:28.637 --> 00:55:33.399]  And again, if you want to make sure that you don't run out of something, you can always sign up for AutoShip.
[00:55:33.739 --> 00:55:35.099]  If you sign up for AutoShip,

[00:55:40.223 --> 00:55:45.707]  So right now, we have just gotten a large shipment of Supermail Vitality back in stock after being out of stock for quite some time.
[00:55:46.187 --> 00:55:51.131]  Take advantage of that now while it's in stock, or sign up for auto-ship to make sure that it is never out of stock for you.
[00:55:51.151 --> 00:55:52.612]  That's at Infowarslife.com.
[00:55:52.632 --> 00:56:04.422]  When we look at these comments, again, going back to Oregon Live, LaVoy Finicum's family had put out a statement about a month ago when he was killed, said he was executed in cold blood.
[00:56:05.427 --> 00:56:09.130]  They accuse the police agencies of deliberately misleading the public about what had happened.
[00:56:09.611 --> 00:56:28.228]  I mean, you can look at that video, you can look at what the FBI told people about that video, that low-resolution, silent aerial video, and then they put their own narrative over it, superimposed it to allow CNN and the New York Times, Washington Post, all the mainstream media to come up with their own lying narrative.
[00:56:28.268 --> 00:56:29.669]  Yeah, they did try to deceive people.
[00:56:30.515 --> 00:56:31.515]  And she didn't back off of this.
[00:56:31.535 --> 00:56:32.816]  She said, my husband was murdered.
[00:56:33.376 --> 00:56:39.599]  And the attorney for M and Bundy said, I'm going to have to go back and reconsider all the conspiracy theories that I had previously written off.
[00:56:40.559 --> 00:56:50.844]  Let me read you what Stuart Rhodes wrote on this article where he talked to, and I read excerpts from the law, the veteran SWAT officer who went on the record and said, hey, let's just read the law.
[00:56:50.944 --> 00:56:52.905]  What is the Oregon State Police policy?
[00:56:52.925 --> 00:56:55.766]  And of course, they used lethal force before they even started shooting.
[00:56:56.530 --> 00:57:01.493]  They started shooting at them before they even, when they set up the blockade, that was lethal force.
[00:57:01.753 --> 00:57:07.356]  When they approached the lethal force blockade, which violated Oregon State policy, they began shooting at them.
[00:57:07.896 --> 00:57:11.859]  More use of lethal force against people that were not a threat to them.
[00:57:12.619 --> 00:57:15.801]  And Sturt Rhodes had this comment, basically the same thing that we had said before.
[00:57:16.656 --> 00:57:17.536]  But he says it very well.
[00:57:17.576 --> 00:57:31.401]  He says it's clear the politicians, like the Oregon governor, the two senators, as well as political hacks within the Obama administration, were pushing for the FBI and the Oregon State Police to stop the virus of Finnicum and the Bundy free speech from spreading.
[00:57:31.801 --> 00:57:33.422]  It was a political decision.
[00:57:34.062 --> 00:57:36.583]  There was no physical emergency, no threat.
[00:57:37.183 --> 00:57:39.804]  But there was clearly a political emergency.
[00:57:40.732 --> 00:57:42.033]  And a political threat.
[00:57:42.573 --> 00:57:51.640]  And in the eyes of the political elite, they had to insist on preventing them from reaching that meeting in John Day where they were going to speak to 400 people and the sheriff of the county.
[00:57:53.861 --> 00:58:01.606]  Now, you know, one of the things that really gets the left's panties in a wad is the fact these guys had guns.
[00:58:03.588 --> 00:58:06.810]  And one of the things that we see in the charges against Cliven Bundy,
[00:58:07.714 --> 00:58:09.095]  From the Bundy Ranch standoff.
[00:58:09.135 --> 00:58:10.455]  And I gotta tell you, I was there.
[00:58:10.475 --> 00:58:11.796]  We saw what happened.
[00:58:11.836 --> 00:58:12.877]  We were there at the washout.
[00:58:12.977 --> 00:58:15.858]  We were there a couple of days before that happened, reporting on it.
[00:58:16.259 --> 00:58:16.979]  We have video.
[00:58:17.279 --> 00:58:17.879]  We watched it.
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:19.800]  I saw it with my own eyes, folks.
[00:58:20.101 --> 00:58:23.602]  And the FBI is lying in this Clive and Bundy indictment.
[00:58:23.743 --> 00:58:25.724]  It is a stack of lies.
[00:58:26.684 --> 00:58:28.825]  Calling it a conspiracy, saying they're brandishing weapons.
[00:58:28.905 --> 00:58:33.386]  It can't stand for people to exercise their First and Second Amendments together.
[00:58:34.066 --> 00:58:36.326]  That is an assault on the federal government.
[00:58:36.366 --> 00:58:39.327]  It is an attempt to block whatever they want to do.
[00:58:39.487 --> 00:58:40.727]  And so that's what they charge you with.
[00:58:40.987 --> 00:58:43.248]  Obstructing a federal officer in their duty.
[00:58:43.708 --> 00:58:44.728]  Brandishing a weapon.
[00:58:45.108 --> 00:58:48.489]  You can't exercise the First and Second Amendment together or they will kill or jail you.
[00:58:48.889 --> 00:58:49.909]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.

[01:00:16.266 --> 01:00:19.788]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:20.349 --> 01:00:22.010]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.452 --> 01:00:29.193]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:29.233 --> 01:00:30.433]  We have some videos.
[01:00:30.453 --> 01:00:31.614]  We have a man on the street.
[01:00:31.834 --> 01:00:42.960]  Of course, one of the articles on the Drudge Report today is about white privilege, and that's been a big selling point of the left, of the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:49.543]  And now we've got the military training people and pushing this whole idea of white privilege.
[01:00:51.907 --> 01:00:53.928]  This is the way they divide us.
[01:00:54.008 --> 01:00:55.430]  This is the way they conquer us.
[01:00:55.610 --> 01:01:01.135]  And what I've been trying to get people to understand is that we need to not be divided black and white.
[01:01:01.996 --> 01:01:07.120]  We need to understand that a government is either at your feet or they're at your throat.
[01:01:08.201 --> 01:01:12.425]  To paraphrase Winston Churchill, what he said about the Germans, the Nazis, okay?
[01:01:13.706 --> 01:01:15.248]  I'm not using Goodwin's law here.
[01:01:15.328 --> 01:01:17.010]  I mean, this is literally true.
[01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:19.833]  Our founding fathers said the same thing about the government.
[01:01:19.913 --> 01:01:25.639]  That's why they tried to subdivide it and pit it against each other in so many different ways.
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:30.285]  They tried to divide the states against the federal government.
[01:01:30.325 --> 01:01:34.029]  They were so concerned about consolidation, and that's what we have seen now.
[01:01:34.892 --> 01:01:41.173]  Their biggest concern was a consolidated federal government that dictated everything to everyone.
[01:01:41.193 --> 01:01:42.913]  And that is what we have now.
[01:01:43.534 --> 01:01:48.034]  So what they did was they pitted the power of the states against the federal government that they were creating.
[01:01:48.995 --> 01:01:51.895]  Just as we created the United Nations, okay?
[01:01:52.335 --> 01:01:59.396]  The sovereign states of the world created the United Nations, and I don't support the United Nations, okay?
[01:02:00.156 --> 01:02:02.637]  But nevertheless, as an analogy,
[01:02:03.783 --> 01:02:07.666]  The United Nations was created by sovereign states and people still understand that.
[01:02:07.706 --> 01:02:08.987]  They still understand the nation states.
[01:02:09.007 --> 01:02:12.971]  We're starting to lose that distinction because of things that are happening in Europe.
[01:02:13.958 --> 01:02:22.564]  They're trying to remove the individual national sovereignty, and if you stand up for that, you are flagged as a racist, as a xenophobe, okay?
[01:02:22.644 --> 01:02:27.307]  You are a horrible person if you stand up for national boundaries.
[01:02:27.888 --> 01:02:30.669]  But understand, and they do the same thing here in America, right?
[01:02:30.689 --> 01:02:38.755]  If you talk about the power of the states, if you talk about the 9th and 10th Amendment, they immediately say, you're a states' rights person.
[01:02:38.795 --> 01:02:40.876]  That makes you a racist, okay?
[01:02:40.896 --> 01:02:43.298]  There are real political issues with a civil war, folks.
[01:02:44.098 --> 01:02:52.844]  It wasn't just the people in the South who said that it was a bad idea for the federal government to raise an army and attack the people who are seceding.
[01:02:52.884 --> 01:03:05.532]  There were abolitionists, like Lysander Spooner, who said, we are creating, he adamantly opposed slavery, but he said, this is even worse than slavery, they will enslave us all, and that's what we have seen.
[01:03:06.232 --> 01:03:07.895]  And that's what the design was.
[01:03:07.915 --> 01:03:17.790]  The design was to pit the power of the federal government against the states and then to subdivide the federal government even more with multiple branches that would work against each other.
[01:03:17.850 --> 01:03:21.075]  Of course, now we have the Congress which has basically abdicated its power
[01:03:21.596 --> 01:03:22.717]  To the executive branch.
[01:03:23.197 --> 01:03:29.601]  We allow the Supreme Court to rewrite the Constitution at will, treating it as if it were a living document.
[01:03:29.682 --> 01:03:41.610]  We're about to create trade treaties that, as Jeff Sessions, Senator Sessions, who looked at this said, we are creating living documents that are going to rule us, that are going to take down our sovereignty.
[01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:44.692]  That's what will happen if these trade treaties pass.
[01:03:45.112 --> 01:03:49.435]  That is why they are so adamant that Donald Trump needs to be stopped.
[01:03:50.287 --> 01:03:53.229]  He's the only person who is going to oppose that across the board.
[01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:55.650]  Bernie Sanders opposes the trade treaties, I'll give him that.
[01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:59.933]  He does it because he's against business, quite frankly.
[01:03:59.953 --> 01:04:01.434]  That's the problem he has with it.
[01:04:01.714 --> 01:04:06.637]  And I understand, he's right, both he and Donald Trump have pointed out that NAFTA has cost jobs.
[01:04:07.218 --> 01:04:08.679]  It's been a very bad deal for us.
[01:04:09.139 --> 01:04:11.021]  Bernie Sanders understands that much at least.
[01:04:11.101 --> 01:04:15.065]  He understands that it has been a bad deal for the American people.
[01:04:15.105 --> 01:04:19.349]  It's been a good deal for the corporations who wrote this and pushed it through with their politicians.
[01:04:19.650 --> 01:04:21.211]  So at least he understands that much about it.
[01:04:21.652 --> 01:04:23.153]  But he doesn't understand the other issues.
[01:04:23.213 --> 01:04:26.697]  As a matter of fact, he's with them when it comes to the climate change treaty.
[01:04:27.481 --> 01:04:30.084]  He stands with Paul Ryan and these other people.
[01:04:30.264 --> 01:04:38.072]  Understand, when they passed the climate change treaty in Paris, it only took them about three days for Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell to fund it.
[01:04:38.733 --> 01:04:39.274]  To fund it!
[01:04:39.294 --> 01:04:40.235]  Okay?
[01:04:40.255 --> 01:04:41.976]  They didn't block it, they funded it!
[01:04:42.748 --> 01:04:49.911]  And now they're meeting in secret confabs with all of the elite of Silicon Valley, deciding how they're going to stop Donald Trump.
[01:04:50.312 --> 01:04:51.972]  We're going to talk about that in the next hour.
[01:04:52.412 --> 01:05:00.056]  And we're also going to talk about how these stories from the Drudge Report, the Pentagon using military spy drones over the U.S., that ties to the Bundy standoff.
[01:05:00.076 --> 01:05:02.277]  We're going to talk about the crimes you've not committed.
[01:05:02.777 --> 01:05:06.299]  Talk about the FBI's lies about the San Bernardino iPhone.
[01:05:06.339 --> 01:05:06.719]  Stay with us.
[01:05:06.739 --> 01:05:07.319]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:07.379 --> 01:05:08.400]  It all ties together, folks.
[01:05:08.829 --> 01:05:17.255]  In the last Democratic debate, we learned that there are no poor white people, and that Hillary Clinton single-handedly saved the auto industry.
[01:05:17.495 --> 01:05:19.276]  What will we learn this time around?
[01:05:19.897 --> 01:05:21.918]  First, they wouldn't debate at all.
[01:05:22.258 --> 01:05:26.041]  Then, only during NFL playoff games or Christmas Eve.
[01:05:26.361 --> 01:05:29.363]  Well, finally, the moment you've been waiting for is here.
[01:05:29.704 --> 01:05:32.986]  Watch the InfoWars crew dismantle the Democratic debate.
[01:05:33.286 --> 01:05:37.708]  Join InfoWars.com this Wednesday, March 9th at 7 p.m.
[01:05:37.768 --> 01:05:44.052]  Central as we get a crack at the race baiting Give Us Free Stuff duo of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.
[01:05:44.272 --> 01:05:50.275]  We'll be crashing through their lies in real time for live coverage like you won't see anywhere else.
[01:05:50.635 --> 01:05:55.418]  Watch for free at InfoWars.com slash show and the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[01:05:55.698 --> 01:05:59.524]  We'll be taking your phone calls before, during, and after the debate.
[01:05:59.945 --> 01:06:04.552]  Join us for live debate coverage this Wednesday, March 9th at 7 p.m.
[01:06:04.632 --> 01:06:04.952]  Central.
[01:06:07.895 --> 01:06:08.816]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[01:06:08.876 --> 01:06:09.276]  Good, brother.
[01:06:09.436 --> 01:06:11.138]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:06:11.158 --> 01:06:12.919]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:06:13.099 --> 01:06:17.123]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:06:17.143 --> 01:06:17.864]  Well, thank you, brother.
[01:06:17.884 --> 01:06:21.987]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:06:22.167 --> 01:06:30.034]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:06:30.334 --> 01:06:33.456]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:06:33.576 --> 01:06:35.077]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:06:35.117 --> 01:06:38.018]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:06:38.158 --> 01:06:39.519]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:06:39.799 --> 01:06:45.622]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated.
[01:06:45.882 --> 01:06:47.463]  Or maximum potency.
[01:06:47.663 --> 01:06:53.805]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience.
[01:06:54.125 --> 01:06:57.806]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[01:06:57.866 --> 01:06:59.607]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[01:06:59.667 --> 01:07:06.589]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:07:09.111 --> 01:07:12.533]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:07:12.874 --> 01:07:20.018]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:07:20.619 --> 01:07:28.984]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:07:29.225 --> 01:07:38.811]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[01:07:39.231 --> 01:07:43.073]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:07:43.473 --> 01:07:46.595]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[01:07:46.895 --> 01:07:57.981]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:07:58.041 --> 01:08:00.743]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[01:08:00.943 --> 01:08:06.906]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[01:08:22.423 --> 01:08:23.184]  Big Brother.
[01:08:23.565 --> 01:08:24.786]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:25.347 --> 01:08:26.428]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:28.691]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:30.113]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:30.614 --> 01:08:35.139]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:37.145 --> 01:08:38.486]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:38.547 --> 01:08:39.728]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[01:08:40.068 --> 01:08:42.030]  Alex is going to be joining us in this hour.
[01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:46.775]  I'm going to continue talking about the situation with LaVoy Finicum.
[01:08:46.835 --> 01:08:48.778]  As I point out, it's murder and attempted murder.
[01:08:48.798 --> 01:08:51.480]  And I want to tie it to these stories that are on the Drudge Report today.
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:55.345]  The Pentagon admitting that it has deployed military spy drones over the U.S.
[01:08:56.375 --> 01:08:58.960]  We reported that at the time of the Bunkerville standoff.
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:03.429]  A lot of people said that we were exaggerating, that we were conspiracy theorists.
[01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:05.933]  Okay, we're going to talk about that background.
[01:09:06.314 --> 01:09:08.718]  We're also going to talk about the crime you've not yet committed.
[01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:12.951]  This is all about mastering the human domain.
[01:09:13.011 --> 01:09:15.552]  It is all part of what Jade Helm was about.
[01:09:15.612 --> 01:09:27.597]  You have to understand that human domain analytics, as well as activity-based intelligence, is something that has been the main thrust of the surveillance state.
[01:09:27.757 --> 01:09:30.238]  And talking about the surveillance state, there's a third article up on
[01:09:31.658 --> 01:09:32.339]  The Drudge Report.
[01:09:32.599 --> 01:09:38.004]  Snowden says the FBI's claim that it can't unlock the San Bernardino iPhone is BS.
[01:09:38.184 --> 01:09:39.406]  It's a total lie, folks.
[01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:43.349]  And they're lying about what happened in Oregon as well.
[01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:44.871]  That is now coming out.
[01:09:45.732 --> 01:09:50.256]  And this has been exposed by some officers, some good people inside who have exposed this.
[01:09:50.356 --> 01:09:52.298]  I'm amazed that they released this video.
[01:09:53.159 --> 01:09:54.000]  When I first saw it,
[01:09:55.601 --> 01:09:59.324]  They're just doing this and putting this right in our face and bragging about it.
[01:09:59.404 --> 01:10:00.826]  And that may be one aspect of it.
[01:10:00.866 --> 01:10:05.831]  But I think there may be some people who really want to see this stopped on the inside.
[01:10:05.851 --> 01:10:06.992]  I know there are good officers.
[01:10:07.452 --> 01:10:12.897]  I know they're on their way to a good sheriff that the system in Oregon is now trying to take down.
[01:10:13.298 --> 01:10:16.761]  Sheriff Palmer in Grant County and people who are there need to stand with him.
[01:10:17.782 --> 01:10:22.506]  Let's go back to this shooting and what the mainstream press tells us about this.
[01:10:22.546 --> 01:10:24.647]  I want to compare that to the reality.
[01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:27.809]  Now, this is Oregon Live reporting on this.
[01:10:27.909 --> 01:10:28.810]  We've shown you the video.
[01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:30.051]  You need to see this video.
[01:10:30.071 --> 01:10:31.652]  You need to pass this video around.
[01:10:31.692 --> 01:10:32.833]  People need to look at this.
[01:10:33.313 --> 01:10:40.238]  And as you're doing this, as you're talking to your friends about this, you need to show them, hey, you know, see this aerial video?
[01:10:40.318 --> 01:10:42.160]  That was all the FBI put out initially.
[01:10:42.850 --> 01:10:49.035]  Low-res, you can't see anything and there's no sound, and then they gave you a narrative to tell you what you were seeing.
[01:10:49.895 --> 01:10:53.738]  That is a PSYOP propaganda technique, folks.
[01:10:53.778 --> 01:10:54.999]  That's what the FBI did.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:00.544]  Now we have this other video which was taken inside with a cell phone by one of the occupants, Shawna Cox.
[01:11:01.124 --> 01:11:02.205]  You can see what's going on.
[01:11:02.726 --> 01:11:03.707]  You can hear the shots.
[01:11:03.967 --> 01:11:11.355]  You can see that they're shooting at him as they approach the illegal barricade there that violates Oregon State Police policy.
[01:11:11.395 --> 01:11:14.438]  You can see that they're shooting at him as he gets out of the vehicle.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:19.243]  And what they did was they shot him in the back three times.
[01:11:20.211 --> 01:11:24.495]  The bullet in his lower back migrated up and hit several organs, including his heart.
[01:11:24.535 --> 01:11:25.896]  He died at the scene.
[01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:38.525]  Now, in terms of what they're talking about with this, they say that they started counting all the shots in the bullet holes and said, wait a minute, that doesn't account with all the testimony that we've got.
[01:11:38.566 --> 01:11:39.746]  There's something up with this.
[01:11:39.806 --> 01:11:41.588]  And so they started doing an investigation.
[01:11:41.608 --> 01:11:42.609]  The investigation showed
[01:11:43.269 --> 01:11:50.672]  That the FBI and State Police jointly planned the operation when they learned through media reports that many of the occupation leaders would be on the road to John Day two days later.
[01:11:50.933 --> 01:11:52.113]  That's exactly what we said.
[01:11:52.133 --> 01:11:53.654]  That's what Stuart Rhoades pointed out.
[01:11:54.074 --> 01:11:56.155]  This was a political emergency.
[01:11:56.455 --> 01:11:58.196]  This was a political threat.
[01:11:58.596 --> 01:12:00.477]  It was not a violent threat to anybody.
[01:12:01.377 --> 01:12:02.858]  These were not dangerous felons.
[01:12:02.938 --> 01:12:05.659]  They were only dangerous to the establishment.
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:11.782]  And as I said before, when people start to exercise the First and Second Amendment together, they can't handle that.
[01:12:13.356 --> 01:12:17.098]  You know, we had that open carry rally that was down at the Alamo.
[01:12:17.539 --> 01:12:28.726]  That was organized because the San Antonio police were harassing people who were exercising their constitutional right to open carry, to sling a rifle over their shoulder.
[01:12:29.326 --> 01:12:30.647]  They did that to make a point.
[01:12:31.247 --> 01:12:36.111]  They did that because so many people in our society now have become terrified of guns.
[01:12:37.051 --> 01:12:42.655]  I'm old enough to remember when people drove around with guns in the back of their pickup trucks that everybody could see.
[01:12:43.416 --> 01:12:48.703]  Now everyone would call 9-11 and they would set up a roadblock and shoot the person to death like they did LaVoy Finicum.
[01:12:49.564 --> 01:12:50.525]  That's really what would happen.
[01:12:51.987 --> 01:13:00.417]  And so to stop that from happening, to make the point, to get people to not be afraid of seeing guns unless they're attached to a uniform,
[01:13:02.216 --> 01:13:03.516]  Let me digress again.
[01:13:03.877 --> 01:13:08.738]  I remember when my sons were young, in the early 90s, and I wanted to get them some toy guns.
[01:13:08.818 --> 01:13:18.762]  And we went to Toys R Us, naively thinking that there would be something there other than some marketing things that were tied to some kind of a show or a movie.
[01:13:19.182 --> 01:13:20.702]  We couldn't find any cowboy guns.
[01:13:20.782 --> 01:13:27.825]  All we could do was, if we wanted to, and I did not do it, I was not going to buy my kids a SWAT team assault
[01:13:28.565 --> 01:13:35.790]  Uh, saying an anti-riot thing where they, uh, wear bulletproof vests and get billy clubs so they can pretend that they're beating each other for protesting.
[01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:38.032]  I wasn't going to do that to them.
[01:13:38.092 --> 01:13:40.073]  I mean, we found some guns for them to play with.
[01:13:40.414 --> 01:13:46.518]  Uh, but, you know, I, I grew up with the Red Ri- I'm the Red Rider generation, you know, out of, uh, Christmas, uh, story.
[01:13:47.619 --> 01:13:49.060]  Anyway, uh, people are afraid of guns.
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:52.922]  So what we had was this, uh, this demonstration there.
[01:13:52.942 --> 01:13:57.085]  A thousand people showed up carrying guns, police all over the place watching everybody.
[01:13:57.145 --> 01:13:57.806]  Nothing happened.
[01:13:58.573 --> 01:14:01.538]  Until, until most of the protesters left.
[01:14:02.559 --> 01:14:06.526]  When there's only a few protesters left, the San Antonio Police started harassing people again.
[01:14:07.665 --> 01:14:13.907]  I didn't see him arrest anybody, but they come over and start harassing them, talking to them, getting in their face about it, trying to provoke something.
[01:14:14.587 --> 01:14:24.351]  And as my sons pointed out, every time we go to an Infowars protest or rally, the only time we get attacked is when there aren't people there carrying guns and the crowd of protesters.
[01:14:24.791 --> 01:14:27.152]  That's the only time you don't get the pepper spray in your face.
[01:14:27.532 --> 01:14:29.253]  That's the only time you don't get the billy club.
[01:14:29.593 --> 01:14:31.693]  That's the only time that you don't get shot and jailed.
[01:14:32.114 --> 01:14:35.095]  It's when you show up lawfully carrying guns.
[01:14:36.115 --> 01:14:37.655]  That's what happened in Bunkerville.
[01:14:38.116 --> 01:14:39.856]  People were fed up with the BLM.
[01:14:40.296 --> 01:14:45.057]  Fed up with their unconstitutional bullying of people in the neighborhood.
[01:14:45.137 --> 01:14:48.458]  Putting a free speech area sign out in the middle of the desert.
[01:14:49.959 --> 01:14:51.139]  Free speech isn't an area.
[01:14:51.159 --> 01:14:54.140]  And so people were fed up with that.
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:55.320]  They stood with their neighbors.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.261]  Some of them were carrying guns, holstered.
[01:14:59.061 --> 01:14:59.481]  And for that.
[01:15:00.816 --> 01:15:04.039]  The government wants to send people to jail for decades.
[01:15:04.299 --> 01:15:04.819]  Decades.
[01:15:04.899 --> 01:15:05.420]  The Bundys.
[01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:06.120]  For decades.
[01:15:07.161 --> 01:15:08.122]  Said it was a threat to them.
[01:15:08.162 --> 01:15:09.303]  Well, let's talk about what's going on.
[01:15:09.323 --> 01:15:11.404]  Now, look at the way the New York Times puts this out.
[01:15:11.645 --> 01:15:12.305]  There's their headline.
[01:15:12.345 --> 01:15:16.689]  Police shooting of Oregon occupier declared justified, but FBI faces an inquiry.
[01:15:17.489 --> 01:15:23.514]  They say federal officials had opened an inquiry into the action of FBI agents for not disclosing that they also fired shots during the confrontation.
[01:15:23.554 --> 01:15:24.194]  And they say that
[01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:27.561]  Pittacombe got out and he was taunting officers.
[01:15:27.602 --> 01:15:30.523]  Well, I guess that justifies killing him then, right?
[01:15:30.563 --> 01:15:32.224]  You can't taunt an officer.
[01:15:32.484 --> 01:15:38.027]  As a matter of fact, when they tell you to do something, bow down and worship at their feet.
[01:15:38.047 --> 01:15:40.949]  When they tell you to jump, just ask them how high, okay?
[01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:45.752]  Because otherwise, they're justified in shooting you, because that could get them scared.
[01:15:45.772 --> 01:15:47.593]  They might think that you're somebody with a backbone.
[01:15:49.175 --> 01:15:51.397]  Then they talk about, of course, these are armed protesters.
[01:15:51.457 --> 01:15:52.218]  I just mentioned that.
[01:15:52.298 --> 01:15:53.319]  First and Second Amendment.
[01:15:53.419 --> 01:16:02.907]  They say, neither of the shots by the FBI struck Mr. Finnegan, investigators said, but he was shot and killed by three rounds fired by the Oregon State Police, all of which struck him in the back.
[01:16:04.329 --> 01:16:08.412]  Now, the FBI agents that were shooting and lying about this are, guess what?
[01:16:09.473 --> 01:16:11.575]  The venerable hostage rescue team.
[01:16:11.595 --> 01:16:13.116]  The same people, Lon Horiuchi.
[01:16:13.156 --> 01:16:14.318]  Remember Randy Weaver?
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:21.381]  Remember when they spent more money to surveil that situation than they spent before they invaded Grenada?
[01:16:21.401 --> 01:16:22.862]  Well, they really did.
[01:16:22.882 --> 01:16:26.963]  Spent more time and money looking at that than they did invading Grenada.
[01:16:27.023 --> 01:16:40.286]  And then, after they initiate that use of force against Randy Weaver and his wife, we've got Lon Horiuchi, a member of the FBI hostage rescue team, really just a sniper and a murderer,
[01:16:41.505 --> 01:16:42.645]  Shot his wife, Vicky.
[01:16:43.246 --> 01:16:45.907]  Shot her square in the center of the head.
[01:16:47.047 --> 01:16:49.128]  He shot her at point-blank range for a sniper.
[01:16:49.768 --> 01:16:50.828]  She was armed with a baby.
[01:16:50.848 --> 01:16:52.809]  She had a baby in her hand.
[01:16:53.549 --> 01:16:55.190]  Slumped to the floor with a baby in her hand.
[01:16:57.070 --> 01:17:06.374]  Now, Gary Spence, a great lawyer, got some money for Randy Weaver, but you can never bring that back.
[01:17:07.634 --> 01:17:08.434]  That's something that should
[01:17:10.993 --> 01:17:12.494]  Bother all of us, it still bothers me.
[01:17:13.896 --> 01:17:25.126]  But we got Greg Breitzing, the special agent in charge of the Oregon office, or the one who lied, who put out this lying video, who gave the lying narrative as he put out a silent, low-res video, said, here's what you're seeing.
[01:17:25.146 --> 01:17:27.127]  Here, let me tell you what you're seeing, okay?
[01:17:27.967 --> 01:17:32.891]  He declined to say Tuesday whether any of the FBI agents involved in the episode had been suspended, but listen to this.
[01:17:33.392 --> 01:17:35.053]  And this is even from the New York Times.
[01:17:35.553 --> 01:17:44.140]  But other law enforcement officials, convinced that the two shots had come from the FBI, said they were at a loss to explain why agents would deny responsibility.
[01:17:44.581 --> 01:17:47.303]  Why would they risk serious consequences?
[01:17:47.343 --> 01:17:47.844]  Because you see,
[01:17:48.883 --> 01:17:50.984]  Shooting at people would not be a problem.
[01:17:51.064 --> 01:17:56.946]  Shooting at unarmed civilians would be a problem, but lying to the government, now that's a problem.
[01:17:57.327 --> 01:17:57.607]  You see?
[01:17:58.187 --> 01:17:58.927]  See how this works?
[01:17:59.728 --> 01:18:00.948]  You understand the system we live under?
[01:18:01.828 --> 01:18:04.290]  Lying to your government officers is a problem.
[01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:06.731]  You can shoot people, just tell us the truth about it.
[01:18:07.031 --> 01:18:08.031]  Not a problem, okay?
[01:18:08.451 --> 01:18:14.314]  And so one of the law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said, why would they deny firing the shots?
[01:18:15.154 --> 01:18:17.615]  That's the $64,000 question.
[01:18:17.655 --> 01:18:19.115]  Yeah, it really is a question.
[01:18:19.636 --> 01:18:21.116]  Why does our government lie to us?
[01:18:21.456 --> 01:18:22.857]  Why does our government kill us?
[01:18:24.077 --> 01:18:31.120]  And LaVoy Finnegan's widow says, I can hardly believe that a team of qualified law enforcement officers could look at the facts in this case and say that no criminal laws were violated.
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:38.062]  How could they have reached this decision in face of the evidence that clearly shows intent, intent to kill my husband?
[01:18:39.454 --> 01:18:41.556]  I don't believe my husband felt he was going to be killed.
[01:18:41.616 --> 01:18:45.860]  I think he had more faith in the government than that, but clearly he was mistaken.
[01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:48.162]  Yeah.
[01:18:48.182 --> 01:18:48.402]  Yeah.
[01:18:48.763 --> 01:18:51.766]  Yeah, LaVoy Finnecom as little as he thought of the government.
[01:18:53.828 --> 01:18:56.050]  He didn't think that they would shoot him down.
[01:18:56.130 --> 01:19:02.536]  I can tell you that there were those of us at the Bundy standoff that thought they would shoot.
[01:19:04.417 --> 01:19:06.999]  There was a Fox News photographer who didn't want to be with us.
[01:19:07.039 --> 01:19:08.620]  He wasn't afraid of us, okay?
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:12.863]  He wasn't afraid of the reporters, he wasn't afraid of the observers, the protesters, okay?
[01:19:13.264 --> 01:19:15.545]  He was afraid of the BLM.
[01:19:15.845 --> 01:19:18.267]  And so, I've got video of him on my phone.
[01:19:18.928 --> 01:19:21.450]  He's walking toward the BLM.
[01:19:22.690 --> 01:19:24.352]  Look, I've got a camera lifting his shirt.
[01:19:24.412 --> 01:19:25.192]  Look, I'm not armed.
[01:19:25.212 --> 01:19:26.313]  Don't shoot me, don't shoot me!
[01:19:26.833 --> 01:19:28.695]  As they were threatening us, okay?
[01:19:28.735 --> 01:19:29.656]  Threatening to shoot us.
[01:19:30.646 --> 01:19:35.389]  Yeah, those are the people he was afraid of, and he wanted to get over on their side so he wouldn't get shot.
[01:19:35.449 --> 01:19:43.513]  He wasn't afraid of all these dangerous people that our government is going around the country rounding up so they can throw into jail.
[01:19:44.793 --> 01:19:45.574]  Now, when we come back,
[01:19:46.516 --> 01:20:00.730]  We're going to talk about pre-crime, we're going to talk about the FBI's lies about the iPhone, and we're going to talk about how the drones entered into the Bundy standoff, as well as what we're now being admitted to by USA Today years later.
[01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:02.172]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:20:09.156 --> 01:20:10.177]  Attention, citizens!

[01:21:38.835 --> 01:21:41.577]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:44.499]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:21:44.519 --> 01:21:44.960]  Croix River.
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:45.920]  I loved my dad.
[01:21:46.321 --> 01:21:47.281]  The boy was too stubborn.
[01:21:47.501 --> 01:21:50.223]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:21:50.464 --> 01:21:50.984]  His excuse?
[01:21:51.344 --> 01:21:52.405]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:21:52.685 --> 01:21:53.966]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:21:54.286 --> 01:21:59.790]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[01:22:13.397 --> 01:22:16.118]  Your body's primary metabolic function is to make protein.
[01:22:16.398 --> 01:22:19.158]  One World Way is a unique, non-denatured protein.
[01:22:19.358 --> 01:22:27.480]  This enables your body to have virtually 100% utilization, whereas typical whey protein powders offer no more than 18% utilization of protein.
[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:30.721]  One World Way also delivers life-giving frequencies to your cells.
[01:22:30.861 --> 01:22:36.202]  The net result for so many people is improved energy, mood, and elimination of pain from inflammation.
[01:22:36.442 --> 01:22:40.685]  This technologically enhanced One World Way has been really amazing for me.
[01:22:40.865 --> 01:22:47.209]  I'm 36 years old, and for the past several years I've been struggling with lack of energy, drive, and stamina.
[01:22:47.469 --> 01:22:51.231]  And after just two weeks on this product, I'm feeling so much more energy.
[01:22:51.291 --> 01:22:57.255]  My yoga practice has deepened, and as a massage therapist, I'm able to see more clients than I've been able to in years.
[01:22:57.575 --> 01:23:00.537]  I've never felt results that quick with anything I've ever taken.

[01:23:17.212 --> 01:23:19.314]  Will your family have to fight over what's left?

[01:24:15.461 --> 01:24:16.642]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:16.682 --> 01:24:17.163]  I'm David Knight.
[01:24:17.203 --> 01:24:19.866]  Your host, Alex, is going to be joining us in this hour.
[01:24:20.647 --> 01:24:31.419]  Before he does, I want to tie what I've been talking about with the protests in Oregon, with the murder of one of the protesters, the arrest of the others, and the attempted murder of many others by the government.
[01:24:31.459 --> 01:24:32.521]  We now learn that the
[01:24:33.442 --> 01:24:37.988]  FBI agents involved lied about shooting at these protesters.
[01:24:38.048 --> 01:24:39.730]  And the question is, why would they lie?
[01:24:39.970 --> 01:24:45.357]  That's what one law enforcement officer who requested to remain anonymous told the New York Times.
[01:24:45.838 --> 01:24:46.599]  He said, that's the $64,000 question.
[01:24:46.619 --> 01:24:46.959]  Yeah, it is.
[01:24:48.681 --> 01:25:02.993]  And it also is a question as to why that would be a bigger crime than the use of deadly force against people who are not violent, who are not felons, who are not fleeing a situation like that, who are going to a meeting, and it was an ambush that was set up there.
[01:25:03.594 --> 01:25:09.719]  I want to get to that, but before I do, real quickly, I just want to remind you that Supermail Vitality is now back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:12.521]  Get yours before it sells out.
[01:25:12.581 --> 01:25:15.443]  Again, you can see the reviews at Infowarslife.com.
[01:25:15.663 --> 01:25:17.625]  It has hundreds of five-star reviews.
[01:25:17.665 --> 01:25:20.306]  You can see what people say who have used it.
[01:25:21.027 --> 01:25:36.057]  And remember that as we see products like Supermail Vitality that go out of stock and then come back in, you can always make sure that you never run out, that you never get out of stock on the products that you use by signing up for AutoShip.
[01:25:36.597 --> 01:25:39.539]  It helps you and it gives you a 10% discount.
[01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:44.482]  If you're not signing up for AutoShip, you're going to see that running out occasionally.
[01:25:44.662 --> 01:25:52.787]  You're going to try to go there and you'll find that, well, you know, what happens in our house is like, honey, I'm out of such and such.
[01:25:53.407 --> 01:25:57.590]  I don't sign up for AutoShip because I don't want them to ship it, to take the time to ship it.
[01:25:57.610 --> 01:26:00.631]  So I usually buy it here and I'm the one who runs out of stock on it.
[01:26:00.671 --> 01:26:01.672]  So I know how that works out.
[01:26:01.952 --> 01:26:02.472]  You can save 10%.
[01:26:03.333 --> 01:26:04.814]  You can make sure that you never run out.
[01:26:05.755 --> 01:26:10.102]  Go to Infowarslife.com, sign up for the products that you use there on AutoShip.
[01:26:10.122 --> 01:26:13.587]  But again, Supermail Vitality is now back in stock.
[01:26:13.607 --> 01:26:14.949]  It's been out of stock for a while.
[01:26:15.925 --> 01:26:23.247]  As we look at this situation, and of course there's a story on the Drudge Report today, the Pentagon admits it deployed military spy drones over the U.S.
[01:26:23.287 --> 01:26:24.608]  This is a USA Today report.
[01:26:24.628 --> 01:26:27.188]  They say the Pentagon has deployed drones to spy over U.S.
[01:26:27.228 --> 01:26:34.931]  territory for non-military missions over the past decade, but the flights have been rare and lawful, according to a report.
[01:26:35.051 --> 01:26:35.411]  Oh, really?
[01:26:35.671 --> 01:26:35.891]  Really?
[01:26:36.753 --> 01:26:37.033]  Okay.
[01:26:37.613 --> 01:26:44.536]  A senior policy analyst for the ACLU, Jay Stanley, said that they hadn't found any legal violations yet.
[01:26:44.556 --> 01:26:45.036]  Well, you know what?
[01:26:45.096 --> 01:26:53.539]  I think the dragnet spying, I think creating an Orwellian police state, I think we need, if there's not any laws for that, there ought to be laws for that, folks.
[01:26:53.579 --> 01:26:55.560]  But they are violating laws left and right.
[01:26:56.100 --> 01:27:03.003]  And we're talking about the FBI saying, you know, this Guardian article, they say they can't unlock the San Bernardino iPhone.
[01:27:03.183 --> 01:27:04.703]  Snowden says it's BS.
[01:27:04.963 --> 01:27:06.004]  We've been told by
[01:27:07.074 --> 01:27:07.394]  I don't
[01:27:28.949 --> 01:27:33.230]  Do find this to be a very, very sensitive topic, said the ACLU lawyer.
[01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:35.831]  Yeah, that's kind of light words for it.
[01:27:35.971 --> 01:27:43.374]  FBI Director Robert Mueller had testified before Congress that the Bureau employed spy drones to aid investigations back in 2013.
[01:27:43.614 --> 01:27:46.515]  He said that in a very, very minimal way.
[01:27:46.535 --> 01:27:47.395]  Well, listen.
[01:27:48.593 --> 01:27:53.034]  After this happened at the Bundy Ranch standoff, we had this article from Curt Nemo.
[01:27:53.354 --> 01:28:00.916]  Obama considered using military against Bundy and the supporters, and part of that was drones.
[01:28:01.356 --> 01:28:03.096]  They actually considered using them.
[01:28:03.636 --> 01:28:05.977]  We had multiple reports, and I'm sure that it is true.
[01:28:06.457 --> 01:28:14.239]  It was reported at the time from Doug Hagman that they were using drones as military intelligence, as surveillance, as they are now admitting that they did.
[01:28:14.879 --> 01:28:29.603]  He said a military assessment of satellite and drone surveillance imagery of the Patriot resistance drones under the control of the US military were in use, taking real-time photographic images of not just the activity at the ranch, but identifying protesters, any arms, any supplies they might have or be carrying.
[01:28:29.923 --> 01:28:30.963]  Mission accomplished.
[01:28:31.223 --> 01:28:37.425]  They monitored in real-time video from the scene and as it was reported at the time at Infowars.com,
[01:28:38.245 --> 01:28:48.148]  Going back to a story that was by Bill Gertz writing for the Washington Times reported the Obama administration considered using military force during the standoff between Clive and Bundy in the BLM in Nevada in April.
[01:28:48.748 --> 01:28:56.310]  A 2010 Pentagon authorization defense support of civil authorities issued in 2010 said U.S.
[01:28:56.350 --> 01:29:04.332]  military commanders are provided emergency authority to use military arms and forces including drones and domestic unrest situations.
[01:29:04.552 --> 01:29:06.553]  And he points out this was a direct
[01:29:07.273 --> 01:29:15.639]  A conflict with a Posse Comitatus Act written in 1878 prohibits the federal government from using federal military troops to enforce state laws.
[01:29:16.039 --> 01:29:20.162]  They modified it, they say, under the NDAA Act of 2007.
[01:29:20.242 --> 01:29:29.488]  That's not the one where they said, well, we can use the military to indefinitely detain anybody without charging them or finding them guilty.
[01:29:29.528 --> 01:29:31.710]  We can just have the military arrest people and hold them forever.
[01:29:32.563 --> 01:29:34.084]  That was the other NDAA.
[01:29:34.224 --> 01:29:35.624]  Then they went further in 2010.
[01:29:36.405 --> 01:29:41.907]  They said, well, this would be permitted under emergency authority without the use of the president, even.
[01:29:42.828 --> 01:29:50.871]  They were wise not to use it, but folks, we have to understand that when it comes to our freedoms, we don't need to get into vigilante mode, but we need to be ready to take a bullet.
[01:29:51.291 --> 01:29:52.612]  We need to be ready to go to jail.
[01:29:52.992 --> 01:29:53.912]  Freedom is worth it.
[01:29:53.972 --> 01:29:54.393]  Stay with us.
[01:29:54.413 --> 01:29:54.973]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:01.306]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.227 --> 01:30:04.912]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.113 --> 01:30:09.793]  Four hundred U.S.
[01:30:09.853 --> 01:30:22.556]  Army soldiers at Fort Gordon, Georgia, were subjected to a so-called white privilege briefing, including a PowerPoint presentation instructing the attendees, our society attaches privilege to being white and male and heterosexual.
[01:30:22.736 --> 01:30:30.718]  The slideshow obtained by Judicial Watch also informed the soldiers, quote, race privilege gives whites little reason to pay a lot of attention to African Americans.
[01:30:31.038 --> 01:30:38.750]  The White Privilege Training also claimed there are unspecified powerful forces everywhere, keeping different kinds of people from being valued, accepted, and appreciated.
[01:30:39.010 --> 01:30:40.933]  But we act as if it doesn't exist.
[01:30:41.214 --> 01:30:46.202]  This alleged privilege creates a yawning divide in income, wealth, and dignity, the slideshow suggested.
[01:30:46.542 --> 01:30:52.064]  But obviously, this white privilege training course helps perpetrate this racial divide in America by fueling racial tensions.
[01:30:52.285 --> 01:31:02.349]  This very notion that you can group people into racial groups who have certain privileges is racist in itself, because then you're not looking at people by their individual qualities, but rather by their skin color, which is inherently racist.
[01:31:02.709 --> 01:31:06.631]  This is Kit Daniels, and check back at InfoWars.com for more news and reports.
[01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:11.983]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:12.283 --> 01:31:20.309]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:20.529 --> 01:31:25.574]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:31:25.954 --> 01:31:28.256]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:32:15.487 --> 01:32:18.608]  I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months.
[01:32:18.628 --> 01:32:22.430]  I needed to get my digestive system working correctly again.
[01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:24.310]  So I stumbled on the X2.
[01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:25.070]  I needed a detox basically.
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:42.684]  I want to challenge the listeners who have not tried X2 for yourselves.
[01:32:42.884 --> 01:32:43.946]  What do you have to lose?

[01:32:53.223 --> 01:32:56.725]  I noticed significant change in my digestive flow.
[01:32:56.805 --> 01:32:58.586]  I was like really more natural.
[01:32:58.866 --> 01:33:03.888]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:33:20.298 --> 01:33:23.286]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:23.867 --> 01:33:28.038]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:37.389 --> 01:33:41.473]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host, your co-hosting with David Knight.
[01:33:41.493 --> 01:33:44.716]  And I'm going to be with you about 15 minutes into the next hour.
[01:33:44.776 --> 01:33:46.277]  Then David will be taking back over.
[01:33:46.297 --> 01:33:49.900]  He'll also be popping in some in the next 45 minutes with me.
[01:33:50.421 --> 01:33:53.083]  And then, of course, we have Rob Dewey, InfoWars Nightly News Direct.
[01:33:53.103 --> 01:33:54.845]  We'll be hosting the fourth hour.
[01:33:56.186 --> 01:33:57.788]  Now, again, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:33:59.056 --> 01:34:16.281]  There's so much happening in the world, but we see the globalist agenda taking the gloves off, and just as yesterday, the State Department came out and said, if you make jokes about anything, or if anyone thinks something's offensive, including the word, you know, man or woman, it's the standard procedure that you can be fired.
[01:34:17.002 --> 01:34:18.122]  So this is the new terror.
[01:34:18.142 --> 01:34:27.345]  We will take the food out of your mouth, because we're so liberal and loving, we will make you basically go on welfare, and then later we can control that and take that away, if you don't shut up and do what we say.
[01:34:28.362 --> 01:34:47.149]  And we're going to set the bar so high that no one can follow it and then we'll selectively enforce on whoever we want and the bureaucracies of government and corporations and the whole psychiatric system and all these guilds will just suck in the producers that are left and make us all pay tribute to them.
[01:34:48.409 --> 01:34:51.010]  But that's in the final phase of the end of humans.
[01:34:51.950 --> 01:34:55.572]  Then they come in with the elite after humans have been made obsolete.
[01:34:56.618 --> 01:35:00.522]  By bringing in robotics and systems, not to empower us, but to make us obsolete.
[01:35:01.262 --> 01:35:08.289]  Once you have the autocratic technotronic technocracy in place, in their own words, you won't have soldiers saying no to illegal orders anymore.
[01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:21.141]  But before you can bring in that new system, you have to destroy the family, get rid of the rites of passages that men and women and children have, you have to
[01:35:22.731 --> 01:35:36.637]  Then go into the military itself, if you're going to replace the systems with computers and robots and drones and automation, you've got to make the army soldiers wear red high heels.
[01:35:36.657 --> 01:35:37.857]  You know what women feel like?
[01:35:38.858 --> 01:35:42.459]  No, that's to make you accept being jacked with and messed with.
[01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:51.083]  And then we're going to tell you that, you know, for your elementary school students, that we're going to have talks to the boys and girls about
[01:35:53.407 --> 01:35:55.668]  Well, what sex they want to be, or maybe no sex at all.
[01:35:56.288 --> 01:35:58.528]  Again, as if the school of government has any place doing that.
[01:35:58.548 --> 01:35:59.348]  It's the end of parenting.
[01:35:59.608 --> 01:36:03.229]  Now, they can do the most radical things they could do anything, like force inoculations.
[01:36:03.289 --> 01:36:06.830]  Say, well, the school are now the parents.
[01:36:06.850 --> 01:36:10.411]  Do me a favor, tip that camera down a little bit, thanks.
[01:36:10.991 --> 01:36:12.392]  They can now sit there, thank you.
[01:36:12.752 --> 01:36:21.954]  They can now sit there and say things like, your children have now decided that they're going to be inoculated.
[01:36:22.970 --> 01:36:24.430]  They can have their own decisions.
[01:36:26.031 --> 01:36:26.691]  That's what this is.
[01:36:26.751 --> 01:36:28.632]  This is the end of the age of consent.
[01:36:29.352 --> 01:36:38.414]  But so the government, like pedophiles or crack dealers at the playground, can come in and prey on your children because, you know, there's not enough prey of adults that are dumbed down.
[01:36:38.594 --> 01:36:39.774]  They want us to all be like children.
[01:36:39.995 --> 01:36:44.916]  Now they want to actually be able to have the wolves go right in and take control of the children at point-blank range.
[01:36:46.456 --> 01:36:46.976]  That's what they're doing.
[01:36:47.016 --> 01:36:48.797]  This is a total sick predator class.
[01:36:49.656 --> 01:36:58.758]  That even the mid-level people are compartmentalized and buy the narrative that it's for everyone's good and for the children and vote for Hillary because she's a woman.
[01:36:59.459 --> 01:37:08.921]  All of this sicky sweet icing covers up the big block of cultural, societal cyanide that is about a half inch beneath the surface.
[01:37:10.691 --> 01:37:13.912]  But the icing itself is a slow poison and not a fast-acting poison.
[01:37:13.932 --> 01:37:21.695]  So even if you just lick the top layer and don't really bite into it, you still are stunned and kind of hobble off culturally.
[01:37:21.715 --> 01:37:39.381]  And then we have to deal with all the culturally dead, mindless people running around hysterically looking for fulfillment and going to their Mecca of Hollywood, going to their Mecca system and begging for more and more of the same poison as if that would fulfill them.
[01:37:40.558 --> 01:37:43.059]  That's why we have this story here that David was covering earlier.
[01:37:43.079 --> 01:37:45.640]  Very important article from Judicial Watch.
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:48.361]  Documents reveal U.S.
[01:37:48.521 --> 01:37:52.022]  Army indoctrinated soldiers on danger of white privilege.
[01:37:52.462 --> 01:37:54.883]  We reported last year that was going on, but more documents on that.
[01:37:56.144 --> 01:37:57.984]  So you learn how to wear red high heels.
[01:37:58.204 --> 01:38:01.746]  You learn how to not carry a 60-pound pack, but a 30-pound pack so women can be in there.
[01:38:01.866 --> 01:38:05.827]  And then, oh, we just can't even have people in combat anymore because we can't have women being killed.
[01:38:06.567 --> 01:38:07.988]  And then, oh, we've got to go to robots.
[01:38:10.287 --> 01:38:11.368]  See, that's what the nanny state's about.
[01:38:11.708 --> 01:38:12.629]  Can't have dodgeball.
[01:38:13.390 --> 01:38:14.270]  Can't have tag.
[01:38:14.831 --> 01:38:16.452]  Can't have playgrounds now.
[01:38:16.712 --> 01:38:23.177]  Most public schools across the country, in elementary, do not allow people to run on the playground now.
[01:38:23.197 --> 01:38:26.840]  Imagine if you told somebody that 50 years ago, they would laugh at you.
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:28.241]  Well, you could break a bone.
[01:38:28.261 --> 01:38:29.242]  You could skin a knee.
[01:38:29.963 --> 01:38:34.787]  You could, yeah, but if you don't let kids go out and climb trees and stuff, they will turn into totally
[01:38:35.726 --> 01:38:59.282]  Weak, screwed up, jellyfish who've then been psychologically taught not about science, not about culture, not about literature, not about history, not about social skills, not about the free market, but how to, I'm a woman, or I'm a man, or I'm a nerd, or I'm black, or I'm Hispanic, or I'm this group, and you, and all these faux rights while the Pentagon goes, yeah, we do have drones watching you, and
[01:39:00.694 --> 01:39:06.959]  But if you launch a half-pound paper airplane with a small engine, it's a $200,000 to $500,000 fine.
[01:39:07.219 --> 01:39:09.360]  And how many years in prison?
[01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:12.503]  In fact, David, let's in a moment have them pull up.
[01:39:12.523 --> 01:39:16.445]  I'm going to give the exact number because just two weeks ago, the law finally kicked in.
[01:39:16.466 --> 01:39:21.649]  It was a scale, but the first offense was $200,000 and long prison sentences.
[01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.929]  Oh, yeah.
[01:39:21.950 --> 01:39:22.030]  Okay.
[01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.250]  Oh, yeah.
[01:39:29.017 --> 01:39:30.222]  What were the exact numbers on that, David?
[01:39:30.243 --> 01:39:32.152]  And I'm going to go back into this news here and come back to you.
[01:39:32.192 --> 01:39:32.654]  For drones?
[01:39:33.567 --> 01:39:33.807]  Yes.
[01:39:33.827 --> 01:39:35.147]  For criminal use of drones.
[01:39:35.227 --> 01:39:36.488]  Well, here's the thing, Alex.
[01:39:36.708 --> 01:39:44.050]  Just for not registering it with the FAA, it was a $27,500 fine.
[01:39:44.590 --> 01:39:48.731]  And they could put that against you as a civil action.
[01:39:48.811 --> 01:39:50.571]  So they don't have to prove anything in court.
[01:39:50.591 --> 01:39:52.752]  They just say, hey, you didn't register with us.
[01:39:53.272 --> 01:39:54.792]  Instantly, bing, here's your bill for $27,500.
[01:39:54.892 --> 01:39:57.433]  It's asset forfeiture seizure.
[01:39:57.493 --> 01:39:59.133]  No judge, no jury, no nothing.
[01:39:59.354 --> 01:40:01.154]  And then what was the $200,000 one actually launching?
[01:40:01.454 --> 01:40:12.604]  Yeah, if they say that you're using it criminally, in other words, let's say you were flying it too close to an airport, that would be up to three years in jail and I believe the fine was $250,000, max.
[01:40:12.784 --> 01:40:18.829]  But notice, the way they defined it in the article and in the law though, just launching one without the tail number is criminal.
[01:40:19.050 --> 01:40:20.391]  Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
[01:40:20.891 --> 01:40:23.053]  And so then also selling them, they're saying is criminal.
[01:40:23.093 --> 01:40:33.723]  And then next they're saying, since it's just a regulation that they've blank written to the government, just like Obamacare or TPP, they're saying, oh, we may make the possession a felony.
[01:40:34.304 --> 01:40:34.464]  Yeah.
[01:40:35.601 --> 01:40:42.985]  And of course they can also, you know, they can restrict, a lot of these drone manufacturers have already restrict these things with geotagging, so they won't fly into certain areas.
[01:40:43.205 --> 01:40:45.626]  And they take this all the way down to a half-pound plane.
[01:40:45.686 --> 01:40:46.746]  It's absolutely absurd.
[01:40:47.287 --> 01:40:52.269]  And this shows where everything's going with the smart house, the smart car, the smart book, the smart phone.
[01:40:52.689 --> 01:40:53.709]  It's all got tech.
[01:40:54.230 --> 01:40:57.551]  They can hit a switch and suddenly your iPhone or Droid doesn't shoot video at a concert.
[01:40:57.951 --> 01:40:58.612]  Order the police.
[01:40:59.432 --> 01:41:10.481]  And they admit they're putting up their own cell towers, not to just grab our data, but to communicate with all the devices that have Trojans to ensure that we then can't respond.
[01:41:10.821 --> 01:41:20.169]  So it's another checkmate on free speech built into everything premeditatedly in this global architecture, which they admit is real now, all out in the open.
[01:41:21.906 --> 01:41:25.209]  So we've gone from there are no secret societies to yes, they run things.
[01:41:25.489 --> 01:41:27.110]  There are no super mega banks.
[01:41:27.411 --> 01:41:28.512]  The Federal Reserve is not private.
[01:41:28.532 --> 01:41:29.573]  They now admit it's private.
[01:41:30.573 --> 01:41:36.018]  They now admit on the news that the government basically is run by foreign interest.
[01:41:36.939 --> 01:41:42.384]  It is so wild now, the normalization process that the establishment is going through.
[01:41:43.547 --> 01:41:49.649]  Just to condition us to all of this, army indoctrination of soldiers on the danger of white privilege.
[01:41:49.689 --> 01:41:50.469]  Isn't that just cute?
[01:41:50.509 --> 01:41:55.531]  And the Pentagon admits military spy drones over USA, which has been going on for at least six, seven years.
[01:41:56.311 --> 01:41:57.252]  And now it's massive.
[01:41:57.272 --> 01:42:06.535]  It was in local papers that Homeland Security was being loaned to the states to go surveil people building barns on their property that they weren't supposed to under the new rules.
[01:42:07.435 --> 01:42:12.720]  So, our military hardware we paid for isn't there to stop people coming across the border or any of that.
[01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:12.980]  No, no.
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:18.244]  It's here to watch us and to keep track of us because they know they're bringing in policies.
[01:42:18.685 --> 01:42:24.289]  And Alex, you know what concerns me about this even more is what we're about to have happen in the next year or so.
[01:42:24.309 --> 01:42:34.478]  We're going to see regulations from the Federal Department of Transportation mandating vehicle-to-vehicle communication devices in our cars and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication.
[01:42:34.918 --> 01:42:35.778]  We're talking about this.
[01:42:35.818 --> 01:42:36.918]  They want to talk about the drones.
[01:42:36.958 --> 01:42:43.640]  I just mentioned the fact that, hey, we reported at the time of the Bundy Ranch standoff, they were talking about using drones militarily against the people that were there.
[01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:48.661]  Sure, and they sit there and they make the debate where we keep saying we're telling the truth instead of saying, hey, this is wrong, we shouldn't do it.
[01:42:48.741 --> 01:42:54.342]  So when we criticize it, they'll have the news say it isn't happening, and they'll have the same news say it is happening, but it's good.
[01:42:54.622 --> 01:42:58.242]  That's what George Orwell called Crime Stop or Double Think in 1984.
[01:42:58.302 --> 01:43:01.703]  Now also, coming up in the next hour, I'm going to play a video.
[01:43:01.983 --> 01:43:05.565]  Quote, is this the most powerful Donald Trump video ever?
[01:43:06.005 --> 01:43:09.066]  Again, is this the most powerful Donald Trump video ever?
[01:43:09.507 --> 01:43:14.469]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, halfway down the page, has the video.
[01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:18.071]  We're going to be airing that coming up at about 15 after.
[01:43:19.251 --> 01:43:22.413]  In a moment, I'm going to air a very powerful Joe Biggs report.
[01:43:23.601 --> 01:43:37.573]  that gets into white privilege with people on the street and coming up folks on Friday, so send your videos to ShowTipsInfoWars.com or InfoWars.com, the contest page.
[01:43:38.413 --> 01:43:43.878]  ContestInfoWars.com and we're just going to have the whole crew kind of vote on who they think internally is the best.
[01:43:44.018 --> 01:43:45.139]  I'm going to look at the finalists.
[01:43:45.479 --> 01:43:47.861]  We're going to post them all to InfoWars.com and Facebook.
[01:43:48.242 --> 01:43:50.784]  Short videos or memes with a photo.
[01:43:51.224 --> 01:43:56.246]  With Bernie Sanders saying that white people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[01:43:56.346 --> 01:43:58.706]  White people don't know what it's like to have a cold, as everybody knows.
[01:43:58.746 --> 01:43:59.527]  We're exempt from that.
[01:43:59.927 --> 01:44:05.569]  White people don't know what it's like to have to breathe, or make dinner, or go through childbirth.
[01:44:05.849 --> 01:44:07.809]  You didn't know just a stork delivers it to white people.
[01:44:07.829 --> 01:44:09.010]  Actually, it's true.
[01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:10.370]  That's why Northern Europeans believe that.
[01:44:10.670 --> 01:44:14.912]  That's what birthmarks are, actually stork bites.
[01:44:15.332 --> 01:44:17.152]  So, that's happening.
[01:44:17.252 --> 01:44:18.473]  We've also got a very powerful video.
[01:44:19.685 --> 01:44:24.429]  That we're going to air after I've left, that is Rothschild's indicted.
[01:44:24.610 --> 01:44:29.714]  And no one seems to know that the head of the Rothschild family has been indicted and has been totally swept under the rug.
[01:44:30.015 --> 01:44:31.556]  So we're going to air that John Bowne report.
[01:44:31.956 --> 01:44:37.682]  As well, there's another one he did, we're not going to have time to air, that secret societies are now publicly admitted.
[01:44:38.222 --> 01:44:39.704]  Secret societies are no longer secret.
[01:44:40.004 --> 01:44:44.168]  That video is up on InfoWars.com right now for folks that would like to see that.
[01:44:45.569 --> 01:44:49.330]  Send that to their friends and family, send it to their neighbors, because that's where the real power is.
[01:44:49.350 --> 01:45:10.077]  But before I go any further and air this report, and I go to break and come back with David Knight to cover some other big issues, before I air this big report, ladies and gentlemen, we have, hands down, the very best nutraceuticals out there at the very most competitive prices, and it funds the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty.
[01:45:10.657 --> 01:45:13.198]  Undoubtedly, hands down, Infowars is having a big effect.
[01:45:14.181 --> 01:45:19.966]  Please, take time to just peruse the high-quality products at InForceLife.com today.
[01:45:21.027 --> 01:45:29.994]  If you aren't taking X2, if you aren't taking Super Male or Super Female or Anthroplex together with those, if you aren't doing that, you are really missing out.
[01:45:30.374 --> 01:45:34.237]  I don't claim to be a beach boy, but I have gained almost 100 pounds.
[01:45:35.038 --> 01:45:37.380]  I have lost overall fat.
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:40.763]  The doctor and folks that I've gone and visited over the last few years estimate
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:43.921]  Probably 45-50 pounds of that's fat.
[01:45:44.581 --> 01:45:45.981]  I mean, it is just amazing.
[01:45:46.001 --> 01:45:47.461]  And I haven't lost all of the 100.
[01:45:47.702 --> 01:45:48.722]  I've lost about 65 or 70.
[01:45:48.762 --> 01:45:50.822]  I mean, I've gotten bigger and stronger.
[01:45:50.842 --> 01:45:51.863]  My muscles have gotten bigger.
[01:45:52.243 --> 01:45:56.464]  So overall, I only lost about 40 actual pounds off my body.
[01:45:56.624 --> 01:45:59.144]  My muscles all got bigger, but the pounds was fat.
[01:46:00.405 --> 01:46:04.286]  And I've done the same amount of exercise, you name it, but I take the AnthroPlex
[01:46:05.444 --> 01:46:08.029]  Religiously, I take Supermail Vitality religiously.
[01:46:08.069 --> 01:46:09.592]  That's what I first had, obviously.
[01:46:10.053 --> 01:46:11.395]  And the X2.
[01:46:11.716 --> 01:46:14.060]  You can get super deals on these products right now.
[01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:16.424]  And Supermail has been sold out for what is it?
[01:46:16.544 --> 01:46:16.945]  How long?
[01:46:16.965 --> 01:46:17.626]  About three or four weeks?
[01:46:19.549 --> 01:46:20.609]  It was sold out for three weeks.
[01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:32.233]  It is back in stock, but a limited run because of how hard it is to get the proper organic cold pressed herbs that we cold press at our facilities we use in Arizona and in Texas.
[01:46:32.373 --> 01:46:40.795]  We also use two of the other big facilities, top organic makers in the country, private label our own formulas, but also some of their products, private label by us.
[01:46:41.115 --> 01:46:41.435]  We're good to go.
[01:47:03.266 --> 01:47:06.048]  Neutropic we have, Brain Boost, check them all out today.
[01:47:06.068 --> 01:47:12.513]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:47:13.054 --> 01:47:22.781]  Let's go ahead and go to this white privilege piece that was put together with Joe Biggs illustrating the insanity of saying, you know, white people don't get cut shaving either.
[01:47:22.842 --> 01:47:23.142]  Here it is.
[01:47:25.103 --> 01:47:27.064]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[01:47:27.084 --> 01:47:30.465]  Now we're in downtown Austin, Texas on 6th Street.
[01:47:30.885 --> 01:47:33.867]  Now, you've probably heard the term, white men can't jump.
[01:47:34.087 --> 01:47:34.787]  Billy, listen to me.
[01:47:35.567 --> 01:47:35.747]  What?
[01:47:36.588 --> 01:47:38.449]  White men can't jump.
[01:47:40.429 --> 01:47:42.870]  Oh, f**k me!
[01:47:43.631 --> 01:47:45.972]  Or, the fact that white people can't dance.
[01:47:46.452 --> 01:47:49.353]  I went to a white disco recently and I watched white people dance.
[01:47:49.913 --> 01:47:51.594]  Y'all, y'all can't dance.
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:48:00.181]  Or the fact that white privilege can literally keep you from being poor.
[01:48:00.541 --> 01:48:04.982]  When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto.
[01:48:05.543 --> 01:48:07.863]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[01:48:08.283 --> 01:48:11.884]  Now we're gonna go talk to some people and see how their white privilege is working out for them.
[01:48:12.344 --> 01:48:15.825]  Did you know that because you have white privilege, you can't be poor?
[01:48:15.865 --> 01:48:18.405]  That's what Bernie Sanders was saying.
[01:48:18.745 --> 01:48:19.906]  I'll say he's full of s***.
[01:48:20.306 --> 01:48:21.666]  I've been poor for five years of my life.
[01:48:22.463 --> 01:48:23.864]  I've been out here on the streets for five years.
[01:48:24.185 --> 01:48:26.487]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[01:48:26.507 --> 01:48:27.908]  I think he's wrong.
[01:48:27.948 --> 01:48:30.650]  I mean, you can be poor regardless of who you are, if you're white.
[01:48:30.750 --> 01:48:34.353]  I think you get special privilege because you're white.
[01:48:34.974 --> 01:48:35.714]  That's some bullsh**.
[01:48:35.815 --> 01:48:38.377]  I mean, B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T.
[01:48:38.477 --> 01:48:38.957]  Bullsh**.
[01:48:39.418 --> 01:48:41.099]  Mr. Sanders should suck c**.
[01:48:41.439 --> 01:48:41.900]  That's true.
[01:48:43.001 --> 01:48:44.462]  You can't be poor and be white.
[01:48:45.071 --> 01:48:47.492]  So your white privilege hasn't put a home over your head?
[01:48:48.052 --> 01:48:48.232]  No.
[01:48:48.652 --> 01:48:49.333]  I'm not lying to you.
[01:48:49.373 --> 01:48:51.313]  Mr. Obama went to his desk and looked at something.
[01:48:51.354 --> 01:48:51.974]  They took a picture.
[01:48:52.374 --> 01:48:53.034]  He can have it all.
[01:48:53.254 --> 01:48:54.715]  It hasn't kept you warm when it was cold?
[01:48:55.035 --> 01:48:55.195]  No.
[01:48:55.575 --> 01:48:56.796]  It hasn't kept you cold when it was hot?
[01:48:57.216 --> 01:48:57.396]  No.
[01:48:58.516 --> 01:48:58.957]  We're rich.
[01:48:59.217 --> 01:49:00.037]  That's how rich we are.
[01:49:00.277 --> 01:49:00.997]  Any office you want.
[01:49:01.197 --> 01:49:02.558]  Any communication you want.
[01:49:02.658 --> 01:49:02.898]  Okay?
[01:49:03.038 --> 01:49:04.979]  We built everything for everybody to get along.
[01:49:05.762 --> 01:49:09.226]  Does it automatically keep water from falling and hitting you when it rains?
[01:49:09.546 --> 01:49:09.786]  No.
[01:49:10.607 --> 01:49:12.389]  Well, it didn't keep me dry this morning.
[01:49:12.489 --> 01:49:14.311]  It didn't keep me warm last night.
[01:49:14.411 --> 01:49:15.752]  So, we'll see what happens.
[01:49:16.113 --> 01:49:18.415]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[01:49:18.435 --> 01:49:19.556]  Yeah, did he say that?
[01:49:19.857 --> 01:49:20.057]  Yeah.
[01:49:20.377 --> 01:49:21.398]  Well, he must have meant that s***.
[01:49:21.438 --> 01:49:23.461]  If he said it, Bernie said that s***.
[01:49:23.681 --> 01:49:24.762]  Yeah, but do you believe that, though?
[01:49:24.842 --> 01:49:25.403]  Hell, no.
[01:49:25.783 --> 01:49:26.564]  White people f***ed up.
[01:49:26.584 --> 01:49:27.164]  We all n****s.
[01:49:27.965 --> 01:49:30.528]  Bernie Sanders is an a**hole when he throwed color into the mix.
[01:49:30.868 --> 01:49:34.932]  Because if everybody was stripped down and didn't have hair on their body, we'd all look the same.
[01:49:35.012 --> 01:49:36.494]  So Bernie Sanders, you can kiss my a**.
[01:49:36.594 --> 01:49:37.955]  I mean, I'm taking this button off.
[01:49:38.275 --> 01:49:39.937]  So, I'm glad y'all got this s*** on video.
[01:49:39.957 --> 01:49:41.458]  Did you say this s*** for show?
[01:49:41.679 --> 01:49:42.339]  Yes, on Sunday.
[01:49:42.519 --> 01:49:42.900]  F*** that s***!
[01:49:44.813 --> 01:49:45.754]  That's totally wrong, yeah.
[01:49:46.094 --> 01:49:49.298]  I disagree with that, with Bernie Sanders on that one.
[01:49:49.698 --> 01:49:52.361]  They can blow their ass too and end up just where we are.
[01:49:52.981 --> 01:49:56.405]  I've been a homeless white man since I was nine years old.
[01:49:56.925 --> 01:49:57.786]  I've lived on the street.
[01:49:58.006 --> 01:50:00.309]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[01:50:00.649 --> 01:50:03.952]  And I support Bernie, but I really, really am offended by that statement.
[01:50:04.493 --> 01:50:05.794]  I'm very offended by that statement.
[01:50:06.094 --> 01:50:07.095]  Bernie's gonna be the dude.
[01:50:08.116 --> 01:50:10.318]  How do you feel about that statement, sir?
[01:50:31.195 --> 01:50:34.337]  And again, folks, I apologize, but that's for documentary purposes.
[01:50:34.637 --> 01:50:36.618]  We don't just have, you know, cuss words bleeped for fun.
[01:50:36.638 --> 01:50:37.779]  We don't think vulgarity's cute.
[01:50:38.039 --> 01:50:41.442]  That's the dialect of poor whites and blacks, Hispanics, you name it.
[01:50:42.122 --> 01:50:43.323]  That's why they call it low speech.
[01:50:43.383 --> 01:50:49.467]  Poor people tend to use, you know, guttural, not the king's English, but that's what these folks had to say about it.
[01:50:50.107 --> 01:50:51.188]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:51.568 --> 01:50:52.669]  Stay with us on the other side.
[01:50:52.709 --> 01:50:53.309]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:50:53.329 --> 01:50:54.110]  David Knight is with us.

[01:51:41.965 --> 01:51:43.246]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[01:52:08.587 --> 01:52:12.290]  Secret 12, InfoWars Life's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:18.695]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:52:18.855 --> 01:52:25.821]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:52:26.141 --> 01:52:34.967]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.

[01:52:41.431 --> 01:52:44.593]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and
[01:52:44.893 --> 01:52:46.174]  Adenosylcobalamin.
[01:52:46.254 --> 01:52:49.596]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:52:49.836 --> 01:52:51.457]  No needles, no injections.

[01:54:25.089 --> 01:54:27.552]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[01:54:27.572 --> 01:54:30.435]  David Knight is co-hosting with me today while I'm taking care of a bunch of business.
[01:54:30.815 --> 01:54:34.780]  I'll be shooting more special reports, popping back in live as well.
[01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:39.645]  David's welcome to take calls also after I leave at the 20 after next hour.
[01:54:39.665 --> 01:54:43.109]  I know he's got tons of news to get into and go over.
[01:54:43.709 --> 01:54:45.752]  The big issue obviously, David, is...
[01:54:46.408 --> 01:54:49.869]  Russia threatening to send troops into North Korea for the folks who don't know.
[01:54:50.309 --> 01:54:57.311]  Russia is very, very close to North Korea and actually has rail lines going into North Korea and is able to invade North Korea.
[01:54:57.331 --> 01:55:04.353]  North Korea is threatening nuclear terror and it was Bill Clinton that gave them the nuclear reactors that they admittedly built the bombs with.
[01:55:04.613 --> 01:55:07.314]  That was a huge controversy in 2006 through 2000 during his second term.
[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:10.940]  I don't know.
[01:55:26.401 --> 01:55:51.866]  So, what I'm getting at here is these elite claim they're stabilizing the world with drones and our refrigerators spying on us and breaking up our families and all the GMO and the glyphosates and the inoculations, but really all they're doing is creating more crises because they've set up systems to gain more power out of crises, but in their march to get total power, which they've almost got, they've built a system that's just designed on fraud and is collapsing.
[01:55:52.606 --> 01:55:52.887]  I don't know.
[01:56:09.685 --> 01:56:12.406]  Against the establishment and against the insiders.
[01:56:12.447 --> 01:56:13.447]  That's why they're so scared.
[01:56:14.628 --> 01:56:15.208]  Your take on it?
[01:56:15.448 --> 01:56:16.469]  Yeah, of course, Alex.
[01:56:16.649 --> 01:56:25.033]  As you pointed out many times, you know, war for profit has been... War has been one of the main ways that these families like the Rothschilds have made their money.
[01:56:25.073 --> 01:56:27.174]  It's been the ways that the banks have made their money.
[01:56:27.214 --> 01:56:36.359]  They supported the Nazis as well as sending Lenin in with a train sealed with 10 million dollars in gold bars to start the Russian Revolution.
[01:56:36.379 --> 01:56:37.880]  So, at the same time, they're supporting
[01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:40.722]  The Communists and starting that Russian Revolution.
[01:56:41.042 --> 01:56:44.805]  They're also supporting the Nazis and of course the Bush family was involved in that.
[01:56:45.225 --> 01:56:46.546]  And this is their program.
[01:56:46.686 --> 01:56:48.107]  I want to talk more about this when we come back.
[01:56:48.368 --> 01:56:50.990]  I'm going to go out to break with part of Donald Trump the unifier.
[01:56:51.030 --> 01:56:51.330]  Here it is.
[01:56:52.540 --> 01:56:53.881]  I have some questions for you.
[01:56:53.901 --> 01:57:00.827]  Mr. Trump, you've done great things in your life, and I just wonder, how do I, as an average person, begin?
[01:57:00.847 --> 01:57:04.289]  Well, first of all, never think of yourself as average.
[01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:08.033]  You started off with the wrong question, because you're not average.
[01:57:08.093 --> 01:57:09.093]  You've got a lot going.
[01:57:09.153 --> 01:57:09.874]  I see you're smart.
[01:57:09.934 --> 01:57:10.975]  I see you're very beautiful.
[01:57:11.155 --> 01:57:14.578]  What we were able to do today was allow people to see his heart for themselves.
[01:57:15.118 --> 01:57:17.080]  And to make up their own minds about him.
[01:57:17.521 --> 01:57:22.766]  And they find out that he's not the person that the media has depicted him to be.
[01:57:22.786 --> 01:57:23.807]  Are you endorsing him?
[01:57:23.887 --> 01:57:25.989]  I support Donald Trump and everybody knows.
[01:57:26.249 --> 01:57:27.030]  Everybody knows.
[01:57:27.050 --> 01:57:27.030]  100%.
[01:57:27.270 --> 01:57:28.592]  I know Donald forever.
[01:57:28.652 --> 01:57:30.314]  I like Donald very much.
[01:57:30.374 --> 01:57:31.635]  He's a wonderful guy.
[01:57:31.855 --> 01:57:32.195]  He is.
[01:57:32.636 --> 01:57:34.378]  And he's miscast by the media.
[01:57:34.418 --> 01:57:34.838]  You know that.
[01:57:35.879 --> 01:57:38.886]  He's got an enormous ego, but he's a good guy.
[01:57:38.906 --> 01:57:40.930]  He's got a big heart, by the way.
[01:57:40.970 --> 01:57:42.253]  He's very good to people.
[01:57:42.313 --> 01:57:44.257]  He's very kind to people.
[01:57:44.538 --> 01:57:45.340]  People don't know that.
[01:57:46.334 --> 01:57:50.496]  You just have to get that word average out of your vocabulary and you have to tell yourself that you're great.
[01:57:50.837 --> 01:57:51.837]  And you have to believe it.
[01:57:52.137 --> 01:57:54.539]  If you can say it and don't believe it, it doesn't matter.
[01:57:55.059 --> 01:57:57.120]  A kid that worked in the back.
[01:57:57.260 --> 01:57:57.520]  Right.
[01:57:57.740 --> 01:57:59.501]  I said, well, hey, how is Donald Trump?
[01:57:59.521 --> 01:58:00.422]  This is before he ran.
[01:58:00.582 --> 01:58:01.162]  This is months ago.
[01:58:01.182 --> 01:58:02.503]  He goes, unbelievable.
[01:58:02.523 --> 01:58:07.606]  He would come backstage, come back to the kitchen and give $100 to the staff.
[01:58:07.626 --> 01:58:08.026]  Yeah.
[01:58:08.186 --> 01:58:09.707]  He would give these guys quietly.
[01:58:09.727 --> 01:58:10.848]  Nobody would know about that.
[01:58:11.508 --> 01:58:17.012]  The fact is, I go down the streets of New York and the people that really like me are the taxi drivers and the workers, etc, etc.
[01:58:17.232 --> 01:58:18.013]  Also his children.
[01:58:18.753 --> 01:58:19.634]  I know his son, Eric.
[01:58:19.674 --> 01:58:20.775]  I've met him a couple of times.
[01:58:20.795 --> 01:58:22.095]  He's a great kid.
[01:58:22.116 --> 01:58:22.596]  They're great kids.
[01:58:22.636 --> 01:58:23.577]  They're great kids.
[01:58:23.997 --> 01:58:25.698]  You know, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
[01:58:26.198 --> 01:58:26.779]  Do I him?
[01:58:27.574 --> 01:58:28.975]  Yeah, I mean, he's real.
[01:58:28.995 --> 01:58:30.156]  That's what we need.
[01:58:30.256 --> 01:58:30.996]  I like his ideas.
[01:58:31.097 --> 01:58:32.137]  Those are real letters.
[01:58:32.177 --> 01:58:33.358]  Those are not corporate letters.
[01:58:33.758 --> 01:58:34.979]  Those are not letters from X-Files.
[01:58:34.999 --> 01:58:35.800]  These are handwritten.
[01:58:36.100 --> 01:58:38.282]  Those are not letters from General Motors.
[01:58:38.342 --> 01:58:39.663]  Those are letters from people.
[01:58:39.883 --> 01:58:40.663]  You have to have heart.
[01:58:40.703 --> 01:58:42.625]  You have to take care of people.
[01:58:42.645 --> 01:58:42.945]  All right, folks.
[01:58:42.965 --> 01:58:44.646]  We're going to go to break and come back with more of this.
[01:58:45.126 --> 01:58:46.187]  It's a powerful video.
[01:58:46.247 --> 01:58:47.188]  Email it out to everybody.
[01:58:47.208 --> 01:58:48.709]  We're posting it to Facebook right now.
[01:58:49.549 --> 01:58:51.331]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:52.812 --> 01:58:54.973]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:58.703 --> 01:59:03.047]  Tell folks how you got introduced to Super Male, and then when Super Female came out, tell us what happened.
[01:59:03.347 --> 01:59:07.952]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:59:08.112 --> 01:59:09.133]  Talk about the effects.
[01:59:09.453 --> 01:59:10.934]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:59:10.954 --> 01:59:12.556]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:59:12.876 --> 01:59:13.937]  I feel like I look better.
[01:59:13.997 --> 01:59:14.638]  I feel better.
[01:59:14.718 --> 01:59:15.739]  I feel sexier.
[01:59:15.759 --> 01:59:16.479]  I love it.
[01:59:16.740 --> 01:59:19.662]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[01:59:19.722 --> 01:59:22.405]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[01:59:22.625 --> 01:59:23.665]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:59:23.705 --> 01:59:24.746]  Consult your physician.
[01:59:24.886 --> 01:59:27.107]  Visit Infowarslife.com today.
[01:59:27.267 --> 01:59:28.207]  This is life-changing.
[01:59:28.587 --> 01:59:29.348]  Shower filters.
[01:59:29.508 --> 01:59:31.088]  We're introducing the best yet.
[01:59:31.108 --> 01:59:35.150]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[01:59:35.290 --> 01:59:39.912]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[01:59:40.112 --> 01:59:47.035]  This new four-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.
[01:59:47.195 --> 01:59:50.156]  You can find more details on this amazing new filter and free shipping
[01:59:50.476 --> 01:59:51.898]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:18.976 --> 02:00:21.118]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:21.659 --> 02:00:26.805]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:28.712 --> 02:00:34.017]  You see, they hate Donald Trump because he's an alpha male, he's aggressive, and he believes in humanity, and he believes in others.
[02:00:34.658 --> 02:00:52.535]  And they call that narcissism, and that's why the media pushes this idea that if you're confident, you're strong, you like yourself, you like others, you don't need the psychologist, you don't need Madison Avenue, you don't need Wall Street, you don't need the image makers in Hollywood to make you feel insecure, so you've got to buy their image, their worldview.
[02:00:54.264 --> 02:00:57.246]  I mean, is there some context to the psychological systems that are out there?
[02:00:57.306 --> 02:00:58.767]  Sure, and it's as wide as the rainbow.
[02:00:59.808 --> 02:01:00.808]  As the color of the rainbow.
[02:01:01.089 --> 02:01:02.189]  Some of it's good, some of it's bad.
[02:01:02.209 --> 02:01:03.330]  Some of it makes sense, some of it doesn't.
[02:01:04.311 --> 02:01:09.714]  They set themselves up as the new priesthood, though, and they use psychology to dumb the culture down in the media.
[02:01:09.794 --> 02:01:18.400]  Not the average psychologist or psychiatrist, but the dominant system is about social control, as it was in Russia, as it was in Germany, as it is here today.
[02:01:19.461 --> 02:01:21.062]  And they hate a Donald Trump type.
[02:01:22.230 --> 02:01:36.464]  Because, see, a real narcissist in the classical sense doesn't care about other people, doesn't give tips, doesn't believe in others, and isn't even a real person themselves, just has this fake image of themselves that they're invincible, they're great.
[02:01:37.525 --> 02:01:42.430]  I have, on the street, before I run into people, and I have been interviewed by Psychology Today,
[02:01:43.772 --> 02:01:47.654]  And they say to you, and I've had psychologists walk up and go, you're a narcissist, man, I tell you.
[02:01:47.694 --> 02:01:49.355]  And they're like, oh yeah, you claim you have all these listeners.
[02:01:49.395 --> 02:01:49.935]  You don't have that.
[02:01:50.375 --> 02:01:52.737]  Or you claim that you can change the world.
[02:01:53.157 --> 02:01:53.857]  You can't do that.
[02:01:54.698 --> 02:01:57.179]  And what they're saying is, we aren't on the playing field.
[02:01:58.260 --> 02:01:59.660]  That's what psychology today was asking me.
[02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:01.341]  So you think you can change the world?
[02:02:01.381 --> 02:02:02.502]  You think there's corrupt forces?
[02:02:03.082 --> 02:02:05.303]  You think that you can see things that are going on?
[02:02:05.803 --> 02:02:08.445]  I'm like, I can read a bill and hear them lying about it on TV, yeah.
[02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:11.162]  They want you to just give up and believe you have no power.
[02:02:11.483 --> 02:02:22.957]  And so it's the spirit of Donald Trump, the fact that he is optimistic, he does believe in America, he's got his own issues, nobody's perfect, scares them because they're busy telling us families are bad, men are bad.
[02:02:24.226 --> 02:02:25.567]  You know, loving God is bad.
[02:02:26.047 --> 02:02:26.767]  Only the state.
[02:02:26.927 --> 02:02:27.528]  Only them.
[02:02:27.848 --> 02:02:28.728]  Words are bad.
[02:02:28.788 --> 02:02:29.529]  Language is bad.
[02:02:29.809 --> 02:02:31.890]  These people are absolutely out of control.
[02:02:31.930 --> 02:02:36.292]  So I'm going to play more of the video, but it's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:02:37.052 --> 02:02:39.554]  The full video, we're putting it on Facebook, Twitter.
[02:02:39.574 --> 02:02:40.434]  I want it to go viral.
[02:02:40.854 --> 02:02:42.835]  Is this the most powerful Donald Trump video ever?
[02:02:43.296 --> 02:02:44.376]  And I think it really is.
[02:02:44.396 --> 02:02:48.498]  And we need to air the whole thing on The Nightly News tonight, because it needs to go viral.
[02:02:48.518 --> 02:02:49.719]  We need commentary on it.
[02:02:50.452 --> 02:02:54.975]  You know, because it really shows what he was saying 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago.
[02:02:55.656 --> 02:02:57.277]  And he's there empowering people.
[02:02:57.357 --> 02:03:01.820]  I always tell listeners, don't call and tell me how great I am, because I know you're just as great as I am.
[02:03:02.060 --> 02:03:10.886]  If you ever figured out the power you had and wanted to learn about the real world, they just want you to stay in a restive development like a little kid in the seventh grade that feels insecure and bullied.
[02:03:12.007 --> 02:03:14.188]  We don't need any more education from the establishment.
[02:03:14.808 --> 02:03:16.550]  No dark sarcasm in the classroom.
[02:03:17.532 --> 02:03:24.636]  And then meanwhile, these government controllers go home and get beaten within inches of their lives by their fat and psychopathic wives.
[02:03:25.036 --> 02:03:26.577]  That's an archetype of the whole deal.
[02:03:27.037 --> 02:03:30.378]  We want to empower everybody to not have a top-down nanny state.
[02:03:30.639 --> 02:03:33.260]  David Knight, take us out to break with your view on what I was just saying.
[02:03:34.005 --> 02:03:40.508]  Yeah, you know, Alex, I'm looking at some of these articles about, this is one that was on Drudge Report, the undemocratic Democratic Party.
[02:03:40.528 --> 02:03:43.549]  They're talking about how rigged this election is.
[02:03:43.749 --> 02:03:48.471]  And of course, we have FiveThirtyEight saying Donald Trump would be easy to stop if they had Democrat rules.
[02:03:48.951 --> 02:03:54.714]  The article that talks about how rigged this process is points out that we've got these distinguished members.
[02:03:54.974 --> 02:03:56.894]  Understand what's going on in the Democrat Party.
[02:03:56.914 --> 02:04:02.137]  10,000 voters equals one distinguished member.
[02:04:05.018 --> 02:04:12.561]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:04:12.601 --> 02:04:16.523]  What we've got here is crony democracy, okay?
[02:04:16.763 --> 02:04:19.504]  You want to talk about crony capitalism because you hate capitalism?
[02:04:19.804 --> 02:04:22.585]  I understand crony capitalism is not capitalism.
[02:04:22.625 --> 02:04:23.466]  It's not free market.
[02:04:23.486 --> 02:04:24.786]  Free market is a better term.
[02:04:24.826 --> 02:04:25.587]  Let's understand that.
[02:04:26.627 --> 02:04:28.428]  Crony capitalism is gangsterism.
[02:04:28.648 --> 02:04:30.029]  Exactly, it's a gangsterism.
[02:04:30.089 --> 02:04:35.012]  But they like to use that word capitalism because it gives it a negative connotation to anything that's capitalism.
[02:04:35.532 --> 02:04:42.876]  But understand Democrats, understand Bernie Sanders supporters, that what you've got here is crony socialism, crony statism.
[02:04:42.896 --> 02:04:45.618]  You want to put everything in the state, this is the kind of deal you're going to get.
[02:04:46.158 --> 02:04:50.780]  Stateism, fascism, packaged as socialism, or... I mean, it's all bull.
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:51.820]  David, stay there.
[02:04:52.180 --> 02:04:59.603]  Come back, let's talk more about that theme, and then how we shatter the paradigm about the globalist model of full-spectrum dominance.
[02:04:59.623 --> 02:05:00.924]  We're going to define what that really is.
[02:05:01.044 --> 02:05:08.047]  Our definition, groundbreaking, you know, creating our own terms, our own lenses, outside of the prescribed orthodoxy of Hollywood.
[02:05:08.826 --> 02:05:17.251]  In the last Democratic debate, we learned that there are no poor white people, and that Hillary Clinton single-handedly saved the auto industry.
[02:05:17.491 --> 02:05:19.272]  What will we learn this time around?
[02:05:19.892 --> 02:05:21.914]  First, they wouldn't debate at all.
[02:05:22.254 --> 02:05:26.036]  Then, only during NFL playoff games or Christmas Eve.
[02:05:26.356 --> 02:05:29.358]  Well, finally, the moment you've been waiting for is here.
[02:05:29.698 --> 02:05:32.980]  Watch the InfoWars crew dismantle the Democratic debate.

[02:08:11.224 --> 02:08:18.969]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:25.131 --> 02:08:28.572]  When you look at what the entire culture is doing, it's trying to con people.
[02:08:29.953 --> 02:08:31.114]  And it's designed top-down.
[02:08:31.154 --> 02:08:32.374]  The globalists have met this plan.
[02:08:32.814 --> 02:08:40.698]  And just as David Knight briefly chimed in last hour, when I was going over different subjects, the elite fund Hitler, and they fund the Soviets.
[02:08:40.998 --> 02:08:41.358]  On record.
[02:08:42.295 --> 02:08:54.483]  We're going to get to the Rothschilds, the family that famously funded Napoleon and the British Empire, and then double-crossed the British Empire, even as they gave them the victory over Napoleon, crashing the stock market, claiming Napoleon had won.
[02:08:54.503 --> 02:08:55.363]  This is all part of history.
[02:08:55.923 --> 02:08:57.104]  It's full-spectrum dominance.
[02:08:57.144 --> 02:09:00.946]  You think of us fighting the Russians, or fighting Al-Qaeda, or fighting whatever.
[02:09:01.907 --> 02:09:04.629]  Meanwhile, our elite that took us over
[02:09:05.851 --> 02:09:06.191]  Take a look.
[02:09:26.772 --> 02:09:34.941]  Hard-working Chinese people, smart and genius, some of the most competitive in the world, under a communist model, to leverage out and destroy the rest of the free world.
[02:09:35.562 --> 02:09:37.804]  It's a billion-plus slaves, it's not communism.
[02:09:37.824 --> 02:09:38.885]  It doesn't exist.
[02:09:39.927 --> 02:09:41.709]  I mean, they've got a master plan, folks.
[02:09:42.049 --> 02:09:46.274]  And then the Chinese elite now are getting ready to try to double-cross the Anglo-American establishment.
[02:09:46.314 --> 02:09:47.635]  This is full-spectrum dominance.
[02:09:49.292 --> 02:10:03.773]  Ship the narcotics in, on record, have the big banks launder the money, and then bust the low-level people when they use the drugs, put them in the private prison itself, owned in part or in old, by the big mega-bank that actually owns and leases the aircraft that fly the drugs in.
[02:10:04.855 --> 02:10:09.999]  The aircraft that get busted are the cartels and smaller groups that don't play ball.
[02:10:10.460 --> 02:10:12.121]  And I told you that 20-something years ago.
[02:10:12.161 --> 02:10:13.622]  Everybody else has been declassified.
[02:10:14.043 --> 02:10:16.785]  Now they make movies like Saqqara, is that how you pronounce it in Spanish?
[02:10:17.025 --> 02:10:17.766]  And he's Hitman.
[02:10:17.906 --> 02:10:18.526]  Excellent film.
[02:10:18.907 --> 02:10:19.567]  So accurate.
[02:10:20.668 --> 02:10:24.391]  And at the end, the CIA is knocking out the last cartel they don't control.
[02:10:24.932 --> 02:10:26.133]  And they go, no, we run the drugs.
[02:10:26.233 --> 02:10:27.614]  We control the cartels.
[02:10:28.435 --> 02:10:30.837]  And the FBI agent lady is like, what?
[02:10:32.331 --> 02:10:33.712]  But it's like, no, now you're smart.
[02:10:33.732 --> 02:10:34.632]  She goes, oh, I get it.
[02:10:35.313 --> 02:10:36.814]  And it's like so evil.
[02:10:37.734 --> 02:10:43.397]  I expect him to come out and admit they kidnapped kids next and actually torture them to death and just go, well, we do it to make sure the wrong people don't.
[02:10:43.697 --> 02:10:45.958]  And that's what Brzezinski wrote in the Technotronic era.
[02:10:46.398 --> 02:10:48.780]  He actually wrote in the Technotronic era.
[02:10:50.275 --> 02:11:04.868]  Back in the 70s, one of the first books I read on geopolitics when I was like 12 years old, my dad had talked about it, I'd seen it on the bookshelf, and he said, no, the elites run the drugs and run the organized crime and run all forms of evil, and that's how we control it to keep order.
[02:11:05.569 --> 02:11:06.489]  See their sick thinking?
[02:11:07.330 --> 02:11:09.691]  See, they write books on this, okay?
[02:11:10.111 --> 02:11:10.772]  This is a fact.
[02:11:11.092 --> 02:11:13.593]  But 99% of people in government corporations don't know it.
[02:11:13.853 --> 02:11:17.055]  We're all these goody two-shoes controlled by this fake leftist cosmology.
[02:11:17.335 --> 02:11:24.579]  How do you describe full-spectrum dominance and how do we get this paradigm into the general population's understanding, David?
[02:11:24.599 --> 02:11:32.402]  You've got about three minutes here and then we're going to go to this report where the Rothschilds are in trouble but no one knows about it because they've shut it down.
[02:11:32.422 --> 02:11:33.543]  David Knight.
[02:11:33.743 --> 02:11:37.347]  Alex, you know, full spectrum dominance is unfolding before our very eyes here in this election.
[02:11:37.367 --> 02:11:38.689]  We had these stories that came out yesterday.
[02:11:38.729 --> 02:11:39.309]  Secret meeting.
[02:11:39.670 --> 02:11:43.614]  Tech CEOs and top Republicans plot to stop Trump.
[02:11:44.055 --> 02:11:48.560]  And we see Bloomberg saying Paul Ryan's House agenda being upended by Trump.
[02:11:48.580 --> 02:11:49.260]  They're worried about that.
[02:11:49.941 --> 02:11:51.083]  What is his agenda?
[02:11:51.103 --> 02:11:53.426]  Of course, his agenda is full-spectrum dominance.
[02:11:53.466 --> 02:11:56.090]  We saw this in the last election with Romney and Obama.
[02:11:56.210 --> 02:11:59.275]  Both of them were going to push through Obamacare.
[02:11:59.715 --> 02:12:00.897]  They had both signed on that.
[02:12:01.238 --> 02:12:03.982]  Two different parties, fake choice, but Errol Krigley won't.
[02:12:04.282 --> 02:12:06.185]  The illusion of choice, but no real choice.
[02:12:06.365 --> 02:12:11.406]  And so now we've got these trade treaties, we've got the open borders, we've got the climate treaty.
[02:12:11.606 --> 02:12:12.646]  What did Paul Ryan do?
[02:12:13.167 --> 02:12:18.608]  Three days after they passed the climate treaty in Paris, and you had some Republicans saying, well, we're going to have a say about that.
[02:12:18.668 --> 02:12:22.909]  Well, yeah, their say was to fully fund it within three days with the omnibus bill.
[02:12:23.069 --> 02:12:24.289]  OK, that's their agenda.
[02:12:24.589 --> 02:12:27.470]  And so now you see, as all these people are coming together,
[02:12:27.950 --> 02:12:38.236]  The Silicon Valley billionaires as well as the GOP establishment and you got Fox News cozying up to Hillary Clinton, making friends with her on Fox News.
[02:12:38.276 --> 02:12:40.397]  Maybe they'll add her to Fox and Friends or whatever.
[02:12:40.617 --> 02:12:42.238]  They've been going anti-gun on Fox now.
[02:12:44.079 --> 02:12:44.599]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:12:44.659 --> 02:12:51.263]  At the same time they're doing this, you know, we've got Rupert Murdoch giving her the maximum donation, personal donation, at a party.
[02:12:51.563 --> 02:12:53.224]  You've got Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes.
[02:12:53.264 --> 02:13:00.748]  Even the New York Times is talking about how they met together and plotted with Chuck Schumer and Marco Rubio with a gang of eight to push amnesty through.
[02:13:00.968 --> 02:13:02.089]  And let's expand on that.
[02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:03.990]  Let's expand on that because that's so key.
[02:13:04.890 --> 02:13:08.413]  How they control the libertarian conservative movement is everybody wants to be on Fox.
[02:13:08.734 --> 02:13:08.954]  Yeah.
[02:13:09.034 --> 02:13:18.182]  So they have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that aren't employees but are on the payroll as basically correspondents or to provide coverage.
[02:13:18.262 --> 02:13:29.772]  Almost every name you know is paid by them and when they pay you even 50 grand a year but you still want to be on air to sell your books and you know be a celebrity to your wife or whatever or your husband you know so grandma thinks you're cool.
[02:13:30.413 --> 02:13:33.178]  They call you up and say, don't go on Alex Jones' show.
[02:13:33.658 --> 02:13:34.480]  Don't push this.
[02:13:35.361 --> 02:13:38.687]  We're not going to let you on the next few weeks to promote this.
[02:13:38.727 --> 02:13:44.416]  I know the inside baseball, they don't have those people all paid to actually have a bunch of people to cover stuff.
[02:13:45.097 --> 02:13:46.278]  They've got way more than they need.
[02:13:46.318 --> 02:13:53.882]  They've got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds on payroll who might go on once a month, but just show they've got them under contract to control them.
[02:13:53.922 --> 02:13:54.582]  This is sick.
[02:13:54.662 --> 02:13:56.403]  It's full spectrum dominance.
[02:13:56.463 --> 02:13:58.344]  It's manufactured consent.
[02:13:58.724 --> 02:13:59.304]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:13:59.625 --> 02:14:02.226]  And when we look at this meeting, we've got all these House leaders.
[02:14:02.246 --> 02:14:08.649]  Of course, you've got Mitch McConnell, you've got Paul Ryan, you've got the new up-and-coming stars like Tim Scott, South Carolina, the new black senator there.
[02:14:08.890 --> 02:14:12.271]  And of course, he toured South Carolina with the governor, Nikki Haley.
[02:14:12.471 --> 02:14:13.252]  And what happened there?
[02:14:13.692 --> 02:14:16.933]  Donald Trump got every single delegate in South Carolina.
[02:14:16.973 --> 02:14:18.313]  Nobody else got a single delegate.
[02:14:18.693 --> 02:14:20.194]  Nobody is buying the establishment.
[02:14:20.214 --> 02:14:21.254]  They're absolutely desperate.
[02:14:21.274 --> 02:14:26.536]  They're teaming up with Apple and Facebook and Google and Tesla's Elon Musk.
[02:14:26.576 --> 02:14:27.956]  All these different people are coming together.
[02:14:28.236 --> 02:14:28.776]  What can we do?
[02:14:28.876 --> 02:14:29.437]  Give us some money.
[02:14:29.457 --> 02:14:30.417]  We've got to stop this guy.
[02:14:31.510 --> 02:14:33.451]  That's right, they are in total abject panic.
[02:14:33.471 --> 02:14:40.596]  We've got to go to break here in about 30 seconds or so to be able to air this powerful Rothschild report.
[02:14:40.616 --> 02:14:42.477]  And I'm going to hand the baton to you, David.
[02:14:42.597 --> 02:14:44.899]  Please, folks, these are the times that dry our souls.
[02:14:45.399 --> 02:14:46.640]  Spread the word about InfoWars.
[02:14:46.660 --> 02:14:47.781]  We're fighting as hard as we can.
[02:14:48.121 --> 02:14:54.025]  And buy the great products, whether it's a Hillary for Prison shirt or a Super Metal Vitality that's back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:14:54.085 --> 02:14:54.706]  And pray for us.
[02:14:55.126 --> 02:14:56.647]  And send those video and audio feeds out.
[02:14:56.687 --> 02:14:58.048]  And send this Donald Trump video out.
[02:14:58.368 --> 02:14:59.008]  Everybody you know.
[02:14:59.248 --> 02:15:04.751]  Let's go ahead and go to this special report that was broken down by Mr. Baum.
[02:15:05.231 --> 02:15:17.315]  In 2015, the French government indicted Baron David de Rothschild for embezzling large sums of money from British pensioners from 2005 to 2008 and for the violation of inheritance tax laws.
[02:15:17.556 --> 02:15:21.177]  In June of 2015, Paris-based Judge Javier Bermudez
[02:15:21.417 --> 02:15:28.220]  ruled that Baron Rothschild of the Rothschild Financial Services Group must face a trial for his crimes.
[02:15:28.460 --> 02:15:32.821]  That is, if they can find him in one of his many mansions scattered around France.
[02:15:33.261 --> 02:15:38.583]  Now the French government has opened another investigation into the Swiss Rothschild's unit.
[02:15:38.824 --> 02:15:47.827]  Bloomberg reports, the Swiss unit of Edmond de Rothschild said it's the subject of a French probe regarding a former business relationship
[02:15:47.967 --> 02:15:58.894]  Managed by a former employee, Edmond de Rothschild is actively participating in the criminal investigation underway, the Geneva-based bank said in an emailed statement on Friday.
[02:15:59.334 --> 02:16:08.720]  Edmond de Rothschild, a private banking and asset management firm established in Paris in 1953, oversees about 150 billion euros, or $164 billion, and is led today by Baron Benjamin de Rothschild and his wife Ariane.
[02:16:15.865 --> 02:16:29.256]  From a Haaretz interview six years ago, Baron Benjamin de Rothschild was quoted as saying, The Rothschild family is so wealthy, they don't regularly appear on any Forbes list of the world's wealthiest, and when they do, their true wealth is minimized.
[02:16:38.683 --> 02:16:43.584]  Their fortune would embarrassingly dwarf the multi-billions of Bill Gates or Warren Buffett.
[02:16:43.764 --> 02:16:47.805]  The Rothschild story is precariously embedded in the footnotes of world history.
[02:16:48.085 --> 02:16:53.686]  Nathan Rothschild became the largest debtor to the Bank of England until the bank was privatized in 1946.
[02:16:54.446 --> 02:17:06.349]  However, although the Bank of England is state-owned, 97% of the UK's money supply is still privately controlled in the form of interest-bearing loans created by the Rothschild-dominated commercial banks.
[02:17:06.869 --> 02:17:16.612]  The Rothschild's modern manipulation of the British economy is clearly evident in this clip, demonstrating Queen Elizabeth's inquiry into the downturn of the British economy.
[02:17:17.232 --> 02:17:23.594]  And he and his group here are going to answer your question from four years ago, why nobody saw the crisis coming.
[02:17:24.474 --> 02:17:28.755]  And after a brief explanation, another question, this time from the Duke.
[02:17:29.755 --> 02:17:30.836]  There comes another one coming.
[02:17:31.721 --> 02:17:39.847]  The Queen's question was finally answered by Rothschild lackeys four years later, after the Queen personally had to visit the Bank of England to get an answer.
[02:17:39.968 --> 02:17:44.691]  The indictment of Rothschild is not simply another dirty banker being brought to justice.
[02:17:44.971 --> 02:17:58.822]  The imprisonment of part of the controlling interest of civilization could gradually snowball, meaning a stop to endless wars, illegal mass surveillance, debt slavery, and a Luciferian cultural agenda.
[02:17:59.002 --> 02:18:00.484]  Basically, peace on Earth.
[02:18:00.964 --> 02:18:02.105]  A bit much, you say.
[02:18:02.245 --> 02:18:17.692]  The Rothschilds financed both sides of the Napoleonic Wars, the American Revolution, the Communist Party Revolution in Russia, the little-known Balfour Declaration, the Nazi Party, the creation of the Federal Reserve, 9-11, and the wars that followed.
[02:18:18.032 --> 02:18:25.116]  The Rothschilds own Reuters and the Associated Press and are the hidden hand controlling all media.
[02:18:25.356 --> 02:18:27.417]  Have you heard about this in the mainstream news?
[02:18:27.617 --> 02:18:40.881]  They either own or have compromised every US and European political puppet with an elitist passion for worshipping Lucifer and an unyielding obsession to decrease the world population by 90% by legal means.
[02:18:41.221 --> 02:18:46.163]  Means the Rothschilds are on the verge of completely acquiring via the United Nations.
[02:18:46.383 --> 02:19:04.225]  The ultimate advantage, listen to this, that the creditor has over a king or a president is that if the ruler gets out of line, the banker can finance his enemy or his rival.
[02:19:05.293 --> 02:19:24.791]  Therefore, if you want to stay in the lucrative financing business of kings and governments, it is wise to have an enemy or a rival waiting in the wings to unseat every king or every president to whom you lend money.
[02:19:25.372 --> 02:19:30.897]  If the king doesn't have an enemy, you gotta be able to create one.
[02:19:31.877 --> 02:19:33.618]  Yes, for centuries now.
[02:19:34.099 --> 02:19:51.933]  There truly has been a global New World Order shadow government family syndicate legitimizing its control over civilization, responsible for their involvement in a seemingly endless list of horrors and violations of human rights since long before any of us were even born.
[02:19:52.413 --> 02:20:02.664]  And yes, currently without as much as a peep from the mainstream media, that very family is being pursued by a French court to stand trial.
[02:20:02.904 --> 02:20:04.746]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com

[02:20:26.078 --> 02:20:29.200]  All classes are taught live online with real teachers across the country.
[02:20:29.400 --> 02:20:32.642]  Open enrollment runs March through July, but classes fill up quickly.

[02:20:39.048 --> 02:20:41.789]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[02:20:42.089 --> 02:20:44.710]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[02:20:44.730 --> 02:20:45.150]  Croix River.
[02:20:45.470 --> 02:20:47.471]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[02:20:47.711 --> 02:20:50.431]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[02:20:50.672 --> 02:20:51.192]  His excuse?
[02:20:51.532 --> 02:20:52.612]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[02:20:52.872 --> 02:20:54.153]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[02:20:54.473 --> 02:20:59.974]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[02:21:00.234 --> 02:21:00.975]  Don't wait.

[02:22:49.059 --> 02:22:50.020]  Extremely safe.

[02:24:18.959 --> 02:24:20.561]  We're going to play a couple of videos here.
[02:24:20.581 --> 02:24:25.949]  Before I do, I want to let you know that we do have Supermail Vitality back in stock.
[02:24:25.989 --> 02:24:27.811]  This is how we support InfoWars.
[02:24:27.831 --> 02:24:31.256]  We offer you the best quality products for your health.
[02:24:31.977 --> 02:24:33.778]  And it is a win-win situation.
[02:24:33.798 --> 02:24:35.339]  Supermail Vitality is back in stock.
[02:24:35.399 --> 02:24:36.180]  It's a limited run.
[02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:38.181]  It's available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:24:38.742 --> 02:24:41.824]  Right now is the time to secure your bottle before we sell out once again.
[02:24:41.864 --> 02:24:47.468]  Let me read you one of the hundreds of five-star reviews that you can find at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:24:47.588 --> 02:24:49.709]  People talking about their experiences with the product.
[02:24:49.749 --> 02:24:52.091]  Here's one from Dan, Spring Hill, Florida.
[02:24:52.771 --> 02:24:53.752]  Uh, he lists his pros.
[02:24:53.772 --> 02:24:57.614]  He says, it acts quickly, good taste, produces results, simple to take.
[02:24:57.654 --> 02:25:00.456]  He said, super male vitality really shows results.
[02:25:00.516 --> 02:25:02.858]  I have more stamina throughout the workday, even beyond.
[02:25:03.238 --> 02:25:05.239]  The product has made a huge difference in my life.
[02:25:05.339 --> 02:25:06.960]  I would recommend anyone to try it.
[02:25:07.961 --> 02:25:15.751]  Again, it's now back in stock, and if you want to sign up for AutoShip, then you can make sure that it is never out of stock for you.
[02:25:15.791 --> 02:25:19.415]  And of course, we have a lot of products right now that are sold out.
[02:25:19.596 --> 02:25:22.840]  Super Female Vitality, Secret 12, DNA Force, Living Defense.
[02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:27.702]  The products come and go, and again, we're trying to do this as a win-win situation.
[02:25:27.762 --> 02:25:35.465]  So, we offer you an incentive to sign up for AutoShip so we kind of get an idea of what we need to manufacture, what our stock needs to be.
[02:25:35.785 --> 02:25:39.627]  As an incentive to do that, we give you a 10% discount.
[02:25:40.027 --> 02:25:42.088]  That helps us to manage our inventory.
[02:25:42.428 --> 02:25:44.829]  It helps you to make sure that you never run out of stock.
[02:25:44.869 --> 02:25:46.990]  So it is, again, a win-win situation.
[02:25:47.010 --> 02:25:48.011]  That's what we're trying to do here.
[02:25:48.271 --> 02:25:50.632]  We're trying to fund our operation independent.
[02:25:51.312 --> 02:25:55.198]  Of the big bucks sponsors and the big advertisers.
[02:25:55.218 --> 02:25:57.641]  That's what we're trying to do is maintain our independence.
[02:25:58.081 --> 02:26:01.746]  Give you honest information as honest as we can make it.
[02:26:01.887 --> 02:26:05.111]  We do our best to find the truth here.
[02:26:05.391 --> 02:26:06.232]  We can make mistakes.
[02:26:06.272 --> 02:26:07.414]  We correct it when we find it here.
[02:26:07.434 --> 02:26:08.716]  But that's what we're about.
[02:26:08.976 --> 02:26:13.837]  We're trying to give this information to you without any external influence or pressure.
[02:26:13.877 --> 02:26:19.318]  We don't have big pharmaceuticals that are funding our operation and telling us what to do.
[02:26:19.358 --> 02:26:21.759]  We're not applying for government grants to do this.
[02:26:21.779 --> 02:26:23.019]  It's a win-win situation.
[02:26:23.039 --> 02:26:24.680]  So again, sign up for AutoShip.
[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:26.320]  Get 10% discount.
[02:26:26.380 --> 02:26:28.700]  Help us to manage our inventory.
[02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:32.361]  Or get Supermail Vitality right now and try it out if you've never done before.
[02:26:32.521 --> 02:26:34.862]  It sells out again at Infowarslife.com.
[02:26:35.922 --> 02:26:39.864]  Here's one of the stories that came up and I loved this title on Politico.
[02:26:40.645 --> 02:26:43.667]  GOP establishment creeps toward Cruz.
[02:26:44.907 --> 02:26:50.451]  Yeah, we see now the GOP establishment creeps are now moving toward Cruz.
[02:26:51.485 --> 02:26:53.266]  The usual suspects, folks.
[02:26:53.546 --> 02:26:58.089]  They say Ted is the only possibility to stop Trump, says a Bush loyalist.
[02:26:58.109 --> 02:26:59.170]  Let me tell you something.
[02:26:59.810 --> 02:27:02.912]  Ted Cruz is a Bush loyalist.
[02:27:03.833 --> 02:27:06.935]  He and Heidi met inside the Bush administration.
[02:27:07.035 --> 02:27:09.076]  They are phony outsiders.
[02:27:10.017 --> 02:27:12.299]  They're insiders, folks.
[02:27:12.339 --> 02:27:14.621]  They're posing as outsiders, okay?
[02:27:15.161 --> 02:27:16.423]  They're involved with Goldman Sachs.
[02:27:16.443 --> 02:27:18.204]  The banks are running through this agenda.
[02:27:18.544 --> 02:27:20.606]  He has no problem with these trade treaties.
[02:27:21.907 --> 02:27:25.350]  I would seriously doubt that he's got any problems with the open borders.
[02:27:25.390 --> 02:27:26.811]  They've gone back and forth with this.
[02:27:26.872 --> 02:27:30.415]  But notice who Jeff Sessions, Senator Sessions, endorsed.
[02:27:30.475 --> 02:27:32.596]  It was Donald Trump, not Ted Cruz.
[02:27:33.357 --> 02:27:34.559]  And that is the issue.
[02:27:34.599 --> 02:27:37.462]  That and these trade treaties and the loss of sovereignty.
[02:27:38.243 --> 02:27:40.727]  I trust Senator Sessions' judgment.
[02:27:41.107 --> 02:27:44.191]  He is the only one who looked at these treaties.
[02:27:44.251 --> 02:27:44.932]  Ted Cruz didn't.
[02:27:45.533 --> 02:27:48.096]  Ted Cruz voted for the TPA.
[02:27:48.993 --> 02:27:50.714]  The Trade Promotion Authority.
[02:27:50.814 --> 02:27:51.394]  What was that?
[02:27:51.855 --> 02:27:55.036]  That was a way to make sure that these trade treaties would get passed.
[02:27:55.336 --> 02:27:58.338]  So when you voted for that, you were essentially voting for these trade treaties.
[02:27:58.818 --> 02:28:03.961]  You were also voting to subvert the constitutional process to ratify treaties.
[02:28:04.662 --> 02:28:08.824]  And that applies not only to the trade treaties, but to the climate treaties as well.
[02:28:09.915 --> 02:28:13.639]  Why would they subvert the process for passing a treaty?
[02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:18.144]  Because they want to make sure that it passes by all means.
[02:28:18.284 --> 02:28:31.619]  It's just like when we look at these metrics, this article that's on Drudge Report today, the undemocratic Democratic Party, talking about how the system is rigged with these superdelegates, these distinguished members, and they point out in non-political speak,
[02:28:32.139 --> 02:28:39.362]  Distinguished members, who are some of the superdelegates, are really Democrat political insiders, DC power brokers, not everyday voters.
[02:28:39.382 --> 02:28:45.825]  And as I pointed out with Alex Jones, when you look at some of the states, when we look at New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders won New Hampshire.
[02:28:47.406 --> 02:28:50.427]  He got about the same number of votes as Hillary Clinton did.
[02:28:51.127 --> 02:28:56.770]  And when you look at the number of delegates that it took him, it took him 10,000 voters to get a single delegate.
[02:28:57.665 --> 02:29:12.637]  And so you really can say that 10,000 voters equals one of these distinguished members, and they point out in this article, when you remove elected officials from the superdelegate pool, at least one in seven of the remainders are former or current lobbyists.
[02:29:12.877 --> 02:29:20.403]  And so when they look at this, when FiveThirtyEight, which is associated with New York Times, Democrats, when the Republicans look at this,
[02:29:21.524 --> 02:29:22.905]  What are they saying about this?
[02:29:22.925 --> 02:29:28.127]  They're saying, wow, you know, gee, the voters, Republicans and Democrats, are really upset with us.
[02:29:28.207 --> 02:29:30.628]  Maybe we're not giving them what they want.
[02:29:31.128 --> 02:29:35.030]  You know, hey, they're not serving you, okay?
[02:29:35.410 --> 02:29:37.251]  They don't see you as customers.
[02:29:37.571 --> 02:29:39.172]  They don't care what you want.
[02:29:40.052 --> 02:29:42.714]  These are pigs at a trough, okay?
[02:29:42.995 --> 02:29:48.119]  And they want to just make sure that nobody else muscles in that you don't get a piece of the pie.
[02:29:48.199 --> 02:29:54.925]  So they want to change the rules, they want to do anything they can to shut you down, to keep you under their foot.
[02:29:55.486 --> 02:29:56.166]  They're not going to do it.
[02:29:56.186 --> 02:29:57.267]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:29:58.188 --> 02:29:59.089]  We're on the march.
[02:29:59.589 --> 02:30:01.191]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.131 --> 02:30:04.814]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.093 --> 02:30:09.794]  Four hundred U.S.
[02:30:09.834 --> 02:30:22.543]  Army soldiers at Fort Gordon, Georgia, were subjected to a so-called white privilege briefing, including a PowerPoint presentation instructing the attendees, or society attaches privilege to being white and male and heterosexual.
[02:30:22.743 --> 02:30:30.709]  The slideshow, obtained by Judicial Watch, also informed the soldiers, quote, race privilege gives whites little reason to pay a lot of attention to African Americans.
[02:30:31.049 --> 02:30:38.756]  The White Privilege Training also claimed there are unspecified powerful forces everywhere, keeping different kinds of people from being valued, accepted, and appreciated.
[02:30:39.016 --> 02:30:40.918]  But we act as if it doesn't exist.
[02:30:41.218 --> 02:30:46.203]  This alleged privilege creates a yawning divide in income, wealth, and dignity, the slideshow suggested.
[02:30:46.543 --> 02:30:52.068]  But obviously, this White Privilege Training course helps perpetrate this racial divide in America by fueling racial tensions.
[02:30:52.289 --> 02:30:56.973]  This very notion that you can group people into racial groups who have certain privileges is racist in itself,
[02:30:57.113 --> 02:31:02.336]  Because then you're not looking at people by their individual qualities, but rather by their skin color, which is inherently racist.
[02:31:02.677 --> 02:31:06.639]  This is Kit Daniels, and check back at InfoWars.com for more news and reports.
[02:31:08.961 --> 02:31:12.183]  InfoWarsLife.com, oil of oregano formulation.
[02:31:12.463 --> 02:31:17.747]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[02:31:18.067 --> 02:31:25.952]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[02:31:26.412 --> 02:31:32.096]  Sourced from top-leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[02:31:32.556 --> 02:31:41.321]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy-to-use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:31:41.641 --> 02:31:47.485]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[02:31:47.865 --> 02:31:54.129]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:31:54.589 --> 02:31:59.733]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[02:31:59.973 --> 02:32:02.095]  Now available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:02.455 --> 02:32:04.457]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:32:08.564 --> 02:32:09.004]  Hey, everyone!
[02:32:09.364 --> 02:32:11.625]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[02:32:11.665 --> 02:32:15.226]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[02:32:15.506 --> 02:32:17.107]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[02:32:17.587 --> 02:32:27.490]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[02:32:27.850 --> 02:32:33.832]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[02:32:34.252 --> 02:32:34.673]  We're good to go!
[02:32:49.189 --> 02:32:49.669]  I think so.
[02:33:19.841 --> 02:33:24.566]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.889 --> 02:33:28.170]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:28.210 --> 02:33:31.414]  I'm David Knight and we're talking about the establishment.
[02:33:31.554 --> 02:33:33.696]  They are absolutely frantic.
[02:33:33.776 --> 02:33:36.559]  They're meeting at secret confabs every weekend.
[02:33:36.599 --> 02:33:41.504]  We've now got Google and Apple and Facebook and Tesla, Elon Musk.
[02:33:42.345 --> 02:33:46.087]  Uh, all meeting together with GOP establishments saying, what happened guys?
[02:33:46.107 --> 02:33:46.727]  You screwed up!
[02:33:47.308 --> 02:33:49.389]  You know, these rules were supposed to keep them out!
[02:33:49.649 --> 02:33:53.991]  You know, keep out the rabble, the people who aren't part of the secret clubs and the secret societies.
[02:33:54.091 --> 02:33:56.392]  One of them is sneaking in on his own dime, you know?
[02:33:56.813 --> 02:34:03.476]  We set up this system where, uh, you couldn't afford to do this unless we supported you, unless we gave you the money.
[02:34:03.516 --> 02:34:06.378]  We never thought of one of us, a billionaire, would do this.
[02:34:06.438 --> 02:34:07.858]  Come on, let's stop this.
[02:34:07.918 --> 02:34:08.299]  And of course,
[02:34:08.999 --> 02:34:10.781]  This is what they're trying to stop.
[02:34:10.981 --> 02:34:11.742]  We understand this.
[02:34:12.402 --> 02:34:18.427]  They're trying to stop the globalist... They're trying to stop someone who's going to impose them on these treaties.
[02:34:18.447 --> 02:34:20.770]  The trade treaties, the climate treaties, and the open borders.
[02:34:20.870 --> 02:34:22.171]  That's the game right now.
[02:34:22.971 --> 02:34:27.636]  And on that issue, I believe we can trust Donald Trump because he's talked about this for 35 years.
[02:34:28.196 --> 02:34:29.757]  On his own dime, or I should say $100,000.
[02:34:31.539 --> 02:34:37.484]  He took out ads in New York papers, New York Times, talking about and complaining about the trade deals.
[02:34:38.085 --> 02:34:40.928]  And so you may or may not agree with him on a lot of other issues.
[02:34:41.608 --> 02:34:53.219]  And you know, when we look at things, I look at, I had somebody send me a Twitter thing last night, said, you know, I agree with you on the trade stuff and everything, but I really find it hard to trust Donald Trump.
[02:34:54.974 --> 02:34:55.674]  What can I say to you?
[02:34:55.954 --> 02:34:57.295]  And that's what I said to him on Twitter.
[02:34:57.315 --> 02:34:59.636]  I said, don't trust Trump.
[02:34:59.736 --> 02:35:00.916]  Don't trust anybody.
[02:35:01.236 --> 02:35:02.957]  You know, that's the motto of Ted.
[02:35:03.117 --> 02:35:03.817]  He puts this thing up.
[02:35:04.137 --> 02:35:04.857]  Trust Ted.
[02:35:05.358 --> 02:35:06.438]  Trust Ted.
[02:35:07.098 --> 02:35:07.418]  Okay?
[02:35:07.658 --> 02:35:07.839]  No.
[02:35:08.039 --> 02:35:08.919]  Don't trust Ted.
[02:35:09.279 --> 02:35:10.119]  Don't trust Trump.
[02:35:10.339 --> 02:35:13.360]  Don't trust... I'm going to tell you what our founders said, okay?
[02:35:13.661 --> 02:35:17.182]  Patrick Henry, the guy who valued liberty above everything, okay?
[02:35:18.140 --> 02:35:25.290]  Said, regard with suspicion anybody who approaches the precious jewel of liberty, okay?
[02:35:25.850 --> 02:35:32.800]  Anybody that is put in a position of this kind of power, and they didn't allow anybody to have the kind of power we have given to a president today.
[02:35:33.200 --> 02:35:34.981]  That's part of what has to change.
[02:35:35.301 --> 02:35:38.562]  And we have to take that power back at the state and local level.
[02:35:38.662 --> 02:35:43.184]  I've got a couple of articles here showing that there's some good news on that front.
[02:35:43.204 --> 02:35:45.265]  A couple of articles from the New American.
[02:35:45.325 --> 02:35:49.766]  South Carolina House passes a bill nullifying new federal firearm restrictions.
[02:35:49.826 --> 02:35:50.167]  Another one.
[02:35:50.507 --> 02:35:53.768]  Wyoming to pass a bill to reform civil asset forfeiture.
[02:35:54.028 --> 02:36:03.237]  Let's understand, civil asset forfeiture is just outright theft and highway robbery, because that's usually where it takes place, is on the highway robbing people.
[02:36:03.457 --> 02:36:07.561]  That's something that came from our beloved conservative president, Ronald Reagan.
[02:36:08.081 --> 02:36:14.967]  Civil asset forfeiture, saying, hey, we don't have to convict you of a crime to take your property in violation of the Constitution.
[02:36:15.939 --> 02:36:17.361]  We don't have to convict you of anything.
[02:36:17.421 --> 02:36:19.904]  As a matter of fact, we're not even going to charge you with anything.
[02:36:19.944 --> 02:36:24.509]  We're going to charge your car, or your airplane, or your home.
[02:36:24.969 --> 02:36:31.597]  Whatever inanimate object that we would like to take from you, we will charge that inanimate object with a crime.
[02:36:32.177 --> 02:36:36.181]  And since that's an inanimate object, it doesn't have constitutional guarantees that a person has.
[02:36:36.502 --> 02:36:38.804]  Therefore, we can steal it from you, okay?
[02:36:39.385 --> 02:36:42.127]  That was what our beloved Ronald Reagan put in place.
[02:36:42.428 --> 02:36:46.332]  And every Democrat and Republican president since then has been fine with that.
[02:36:46.872 --> 02:36:50.496]  Now we have some state legislatures that are saying, no, we're not going to allow that.
[02:36:50.936 --> 02:36:52.078]  That's how we take this back.
[02:36:52.418 --> 02:36:54.060]  We fight at the state and local level.
[02:36:55.029 --> 02:37:02.332]  We get people to understand what their power is as jurors and we say you're not going to railroad people, you're not going to send them to jail for these things.
[02:37:02.593 --> 02:37:04.894]  We don't agree with the penalty even if we agree with the law.
[02:37:04.934 --> 02:37:06.234]  We don't agree with the way you're doing this.
[02:37:06.254 --> 02:37:07.635]  We're not going to send these people to jail.
[02:37:08.464 --> 02:37:11.085]  That's the way they stopped alcohol prohibition initially.
[02:37:11.685 --> 02:37:17.506]  And of course, this whole drug war, as I've mentioned many, many times, doesn't have any constitutional support for it.
[02:37:17.566 --> 02:37:22.188]  Where is the constitutional amendment that gives them the authorization to prohibit anything?
[02:37:22.688 --> 02:37:34.591]  Not pot, not your medical cancer drugs, nothing do they have the power to prohibit unless they have a special amendment, like they gave themselves that power with alcohol and then took it away.
[02:37:35.231 --> 02:37:38.352]  We have two amendments in the Constitution that testify the fact.
[02:37:38.752 --> 02:37:47.034]  In addition to the 9th and 10th Amendment, we have two more that show in practical application the government has no authority for prohibition of any sort.
[02:37:47.354 --> 02:37:48.655]  But of course, they want to take away guns.
[02:37:49.055 --> 02:37:50.975]  Guns which are specifically protected.
[02:37:51.556 --> 02:37:56.757]  Now, there's been a lot of talk about Ted Cruz, especially saying, you know, Donald Trump, he's going to take your guns.
[02:37:57.617 --> 02:37:59.858]  He's going to appoint judges who will take your guns.
[02:38:00.158 --> 02:38:01.158]  He's not a gun guy.
[02:38:01.218 --> 02:38:03.579]  Well, I want to read you something that his son said.
[02:38:05.063 --> 02:38:16.396]  Donald Trump Jr., this was on Breitbart, and he said, between myself and my brother and my father and my wife, we have four of the 1,500 concealed carry permits for New York City.
[02:38:17.337 --> 02:38:22.082]  One of the most difficult carry licenses to get anywhere in the world, certainly in the U.S.
[02:38:22.723 --> 02:38:22.963]  Okay?
[02:38:22.983 --> 02:38:23.964]  Now understand that.
[02:38:24.304 --> 02:38:24.865]  Think about that.
[02:38:24.965 --> 02:38:26.347]  Think about the fact that Ronald Reagan
[02:38:27.236 --> 02:38:32.060]  Many people say, hey, you know, Ronald Reagan, he was pro-abortion before he became pro-life.
[02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:35.522]  He was a member of a union head and so forth and so on.
[02:38:35.602 --> 02:38:37.023]  Is this guy really a conservative?
[02:38:37.043 --> 02:38:40.026]  That was the line of attack against Ronald Reagan when he was running.
[02:38:40.386 --> 02:38:47.411]  And, you know, quite frankly, Ronald Reagan did betray us on the Second Amendment as well as on these other issues I was just talking about.
[02:38:47.471 --> 02:38:51.134]  And he joined with the NRA, of all people, to push the Brady Bill.
[02:38:52.287 --> 02:38:53.188]  That was wrong.
[02:38:53.228 --> 02:38:53.969]  Why did he do that?
[02:38:54.209 --> 02:38:58.273]  He threw the American people and the Constitution under the bus.
[02:38:59.505 --> 02:39:06.349]  In order to do a favor for Brady's wife that he felt bad about the fact that Brady got shot, okay?
[02:39:06.369 --> 02:39:07.050]  So that's a payoff.
[02:39:07.130 --> 02:39:08.150]  It's like, hey, I'm sorry.
[02:39:08.471 --> 02:39:09.872]  Here, let me throw the Constitution.
[02:39:09.892 --> 02:39:10.932]  Will that make you feel better?
[02:39:11.413 --> 02:39:12.893]  Let me throw the Constitution on the bus.
[02:39:12.934 --> 02:39:14.374]  Do you feel better now, Sarah Brady?
[02:39:14.515 --> 02:39:15.635]  Okay, no, it's not enough.
[02:39:15.755 --> 02:39:16.556]  Oh, you want me to do more?
[02:39:16.596 --> 02:39:18.797]  Well, I don't know if I can do any more, but we'll see what we can do.
[02:39:19.037 --> 02:39:21.079]  All right, going back to what he's saying now.
[02:39:21.119 --> 02:39:22.760]  He points out, and this is important.
[02:39:23.260 --> 02:39:32.792]  Because, you know, Ronald Reagan didn't have a concealed carry license in California, did he, when he became, before he became president?
[02:39:32.912 --> 02:39:34.354]  He never got a concealed carry license.
[02:39:34.374 --> 02:39:36.497]  Donald Trump has actually exercised that right.
[02:39:37.639 --> 02:39:37.779]  I think?
[02:39:56.440 --> 02:40:06.231]  He says, if you recall San Bernardino, if you recall Paris, he's only one of those pro-Second Amendment candidates that said the very next day, hey, California, France, toughest gun laws in the world.
[02:40:06.551 --> 02:40:09.895]  If there were bullets going the other way, maybe this would have been the game changer.
[02:40:09.935 --> 02:40:11.697]  Maybe something different would have happened.
[02:40:12.438 --> 02:40:12.718]  Okay?
[02:40:12.819 --> 02:40:16.523]  And then he said something else, which I think really shows they understand the issue.
[02:40:17.455 --> 02:40:25.802]  He also spoke about how his father, Donald Trump, if he becomes president, gun laws will change so that concealed carry permits are valid in all states and not just select ones.
[02:40:25.842 --> 02:40:33.988]  He says, why can't you get a driver's license that's recognized state to state, but a concealed weapons permit is not treated the same way?
[02:40:34.068 --> 02:40:38.132]  There is a process to do that in a Trump administration because it makes sense.
[02:40:38.212 --> 02:40:43.156]  And of course, it was Virginia recently, if you remember, Terry McAuliffe, a Clinton operative,
[02:40:43.796 --> 02:40:47.920]  Campaign manager, whatever, you know, just a political operative who became a governor there, okay?
[02:40:47.940 --> 02:40:54.726]  And his attorney general decided that they were going to unilaterally not recognize concealed carry permits for 25 states.
[02:40:55.587 --> 02:41:05.515]  Some of the states that have more stringent checks and controls and concurrent or continuous validation of people's status than Virginia did.
[02:41:05.715 --> 02:41:07.337]  They just said, well, we're not going to recognize it.
[02:41:07.977 --> 02:41:10.619]  And there was a huge pushback at the state level.
[02:41:11.519 --> 02:41:12.179]  At the state level.
[02:41:12.399 --> 02:41:15.941]  You had state legislators in Virginia said, you know, yeah, he's right.
[02:41:15.981 --> 02:41:21.503]  If he's so afraid of guns, I don't want to scare him by having armed men protect him.
[02:41:21.563 --> 02:41:25.485]  So maybe what we should do is just remove the governor's protective detail.
[02:41:25.945 --> 02:41:26.405]  And you know what?
[02:41:27.126 --> 02:41:28.206]  They reversed that.
[02:41:28.786 --> 02:41:30.407]  They said, never mind, never mind.
[02:41:30.467 --> 02:41:32.328]  We'll respect the concealed carry permits.
[02:41:32.888 --> 02:41:35.229]  But again, I think that he's solid on it.
[02:41:35.409 --> 02:41:37.610]  And when we look at the GOP establishment,
[02:41:38.504 --> 02:41:47.231]  Moving towards Cruz, as this article headlined Politico, GOP establishment creeps towards Cruz.
[02:41:47.251 --> 02:41:51.014]  They cite a Bush loyalist saying, this is the way we stop Donald Trump.
[02:41:51.034 --> 02:41:56.998]  Look, they came out with people that are obviously establishment people, people like Jeb.
[02:41:58.019 --> 02:41:58.960]  Jeb, you're a mess.
[02:42:00.001 --> 02:42:02.703]  Like Jeb, like John Kasich, other people.
[02:42:03.652 --> 02:42:04.472]  Nobody wants them.
[02:42:05.213 --> 02:42:08.375]  It's the kiss of death to be associated with the establishment.
[02:42:09.275 --> 02:42:11.776]  Mitt Romney cuts ads for Rubio everywhere.
[02:42:11.836 --> 02:42:12.417]  What happens?
[02:42:12.477 --> 02:42:15.098]  He comes in fourth pretty much everywhere.
[02:42:15.458 --> 02:42:21.482]  You can't even break double digits in some of these states because Romney is supporting him.
[02:42:22.442 --> 02:42:24.783]  It's the kiss of death to be part of the establishment.
[02:42:24.803 --> 02:42:25.304]  So what do they do?
[02:42:25.964 --> 02:42:31.387]  You know, these guys crashed and burned Jeb, Kasich, other people that were associated with the establishment.
[02:42:32.031 --> 02:42:40.375]  Rubio, they tried to push him as well, and while all these guys are going, especially with Rubio, Rubio, I believe, is acting as a stalking horse.
[02:42:41.235 --> 02:42:48.178]  Distracting people while you've got the real insider, Ted Cruz, and the establishment coalescing around him.
[02:42:48.218 --> 02:42:50.159]  Yeah, he threw a lot of bombs at people.
[02:42:51.107 --> 02:42:52.128]  People in the Senate hate him.
[02:42:52.288 --> 02:42:52.568]  Why?
[02:42:52.628 --> 02:42:55.049]  Because he climbed over their backs.
[02:42:55.169 --> 02:42:59.072]  As soon as he got elected as senator, it's like, hey, wait my turn.
[02:42:59.432 --> 02:43:03.794]  And he starts, you know, throwing them under the bus, criticizing them publicly, climbing over their back.
[02:43:04.095 --> 02:43:07.357]  The minute he got elected Senate, he wasn't interested in being a senator.
[02:43:07.377 --> 02:43:08.958]  He was interested in being president.
[02:43:09.338 --> 02:43:10.899]  He immediately started running for president.
[02:43:11.459 --> 02:43:12.480]  He hasn't done a thing.
[02:43:12.500 --> 02:43:15.262]  He hasn't even come close to finishing a term.
[02:43:15.602 --> 02:43:16.583]  And he's running for president.
[02:43:16.703 --> 02:43:17.964]  That's why they hate him in the Senate.
[02:43:18.144 --> 02:43:20.305]  They don't hate him because he stands for us.
[02:43:20.465 --> 02:43:22.467]  They hate him because he's a social climber.
[02:43:22.747 --> 02:43:23.928]  He's climbing over them.
[02:43:24.568 --> 02:43:27.831]  But now they say, oh, we need to consolidate around him.
[02:43:28.231 --> 02:43:34.395]  Maybe he's got these Goldman Sachs connections and he tried to hide his loan from Goldman Sachs.
[02:43:35.796 --> 02:43:37.738]  Look, folks, he's a phony libertarian.
[02:43:38.564 --> 02:43:40.164]  He said that Snowden was a hero.
[02:43:40.405 --> 02:43:43.005]  Now he says Snowden is a traitor and should be executed.
[02:43:43.105 --> 02:43:43.385]  Okay?
[02:43:43.886 --> 02:43:45.406]  He's a phony constitutionalist.
[02:43:46.006 --> 02:43:47.327]  He supports the war on drugs.
[02:43:47.367 --> 02:43:49.007]  He doesn't care about eligibility.
[02:43:49.427 --> 02:43:51.948]  You know, if he thinks he's eligible, I don't think he's eligible.
[02:43:52.668 --> 02:43:55.629]  Lawrence Tribe, who's his professor at Harvard, doesn't think he's eligible.
[02:43:55.649 --> 02:43:58.150]  You know, this is a guy who's a Northeastern establishment guy.
[02:43:58.170 --> 02:43:58.850]  He went to Harvard.
[02:43:58.870 --> 02:43:59.730]  He went to Princeton.
[02:44:00.170 --> 02:44:02.611]  He's a master debate guy at Princeton.
[02:44:02.651 --> 02:44:05.492]  You know, you don't... He's not... He's an establishment guy.
[02:44:06.243 --> 02:44:08.304]  He worked for the Bushes, that's where he and Heidi worked.
[02:44:08.364 --> 02:44:12.365]  She works for the Council on Foreign Relations, for Goldman Sachs and everything.
[02:44:12.405 --> 02:44:13.265]  I mean, come on.
[02:44:13.705 --> 02:44:27.929]  She's part of a CFR organization there with Robert Zoellick, World Trade Bank, you know, the World Bank and Goldman Sachs, where they come up with a plan for the North American Union, where we have a common border going around the three countries.
[02:44:28.609 --> 02:44:29.850]  The problem that he's from Canada?
[02:44:29.890 --> 02:44:31.770]  He could be the North American Union candidate.
[02:44:32.431 --> 02:44:34.412]  The North American Union President.
[02:44:34.692 --> 02:44:34.992]  Okay?
[02:44:35.052 --> 02:44:35.312]  Yeah.
[02:44:35.572 --> 02:44:36.453]  He's born in Canada.
[02:44:36.753 --> 02:44:37.193]  So what?
[02:44:37.373 --> 02:44:38.373]  Doesn't make any difference.
[02:44:38.854 --> 02:44:40.634]  Canada's the same as the U.S.
[02:44:40.694 --> 02:44:41.115]  now, right?
[02:44:41.635 --> 02:44:41.875]  Isn't it?
[02:44:42.475 --> 02:44:43.396]  It is in their mind.
[02:44:44.156 --> 02:44:46.057]  You may not understand it, but it is in their mind.
[02:44:46.829 --> 02:44:51.751]  And, you know, if he thinks that he's a constitutionally eligible to run for office, then fine.
[02:44:52.311 --> 02:44:52.971]  Explain it to us.
[02:44:53.031 --> 02:44:55.792]  But you see how he operates in the debates.
[02:44:56.272 --> 02:44:59.633]  When Donald Trump calls him on it, he says, hey, I've argued before the Supreme Court.
[02:44:59.853 --> 02:45:01.134]  I know what the Constitution says.
[02:45:01.714 --> 02:45:02.134]  Well, fine.
[02:45:02.294 --> 02:45:02.594]  Tell us.
[02:45:03.015 --> 02:45:03.635]  Make your case.
[02:45:04.522 --> 02:45:05.102]  Make your case.
[02:45:05.563 --> 02:45:10.706]  Tell us why you're eligible as a natural-born citizen.
[02:45:10.806 --> 02:45:11.367]  Explain to us.
[02:45:11.387 --> 02:45:17.991]  You know, the phrase is not defined in the Constitution any more than the word militia is defined in the Constitution.
[02:45:18.011 --> 02:45:19.792]  We understand what the militia was.
[02:45:20.353 --> 02:45:21.954]  How do we know what the militia was?
[02:45:21.994 --> 02:45:23.115]  Well, we look at the commentaries.
[02:45:23.795 --> 02:45:24.915]  It was well understood.
[02:45:25.596 --> 02:45:28.676]  All of the people who were writing it at the time, they understood what the militia was.
[02:45:28.716 --> 02:45:33.498]  It was a term that fell out of favor, fell out of, well, fell out of use, I should say.
[02:45:33.558 --> 02:45:35.178]  Now it has fallen out of favor.
[02:45:35.818 --> 02:45:38.199]  It's been demonized by the government.
[02:45:38.239 --> 02:45:39.199]  That's a deliberate thing.
[02:45:39.640 --> 02:45:42.300]  They've tried to change the meaning of the term, militia.
[02:45:43.181 --> 02:45:44.301]  Well, we know what it means.
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:46.180]  We know what the purpose was.
[02:45:46.261 --> 02:45:51.663]  It isn't any, you know, it's like, well, okay, what is this phrase being necessary for the security of a free state?
[02:45:51.723 --> 02:45:52.803]  You know, militia being necessary?
[02:45:52.823 --> 02:45:57.485]  Well, that doesn't make any sense because my high school teacher told me that the militia is the National Guard.
[02:45:57.505 --> 02:46:00.386]  It's like, no, no, militia is not the National Guard.
[02:46:01.368 --> 02:46:12.657]  And so we go back and we look at the meaning of the word militia, we know what they were talking about at the time, we can go back and we can look at all of the documents that they were referencing and their debate, we know what natural born citizen is at the time.
[02:46:13.137 --> 02:46:22.225]  But of course now the establishment is coming towards him and as we pointed out yesterday, we have Neil Bush, who is now not only endorsing him, although on the Bush brothers,
[02:46:23.134 --> 02:46:25.695]  But he's going to be joining his campaign finance team.
[02:46:25.735 --> 02:46:31.776]  Let's play a clip to remind you about Neil Bush's financial expertise.
[02:46:32.116 --> 02:46:32.776]  Here's that clip.
[02:46:33.817 --> 02:46:41.319]  Federal banking regulators have finally decided what to do to President Bush's son, Neil, for his part in a savings and loan debacle.
[02:46:41.799 --> 02:46:47.880]  Neil Bush was a director of a Denver-based outfit that was part of the overall national savings and loan scandal.
[02:46:48.280 --> 02:46:51.021]  Rita Braber reports on what federal regulators concluded.
[02:46:52.836 --> 02:47:04.100]  The government agency that supervises savings and loans today formally declared that Neil Bush engaged in conflicts of interest while serving as a director of the failed Silverado SNL.
[02:47:04.661 --> 02:47:08.182]  The chief of the Office of Thrift Supervision would not discuss his decision.
[02:47:08.682 --> 02:47:10.483]  No, I really can have no comment on that.
[02:47:10.503 --> 02:47:10.923]  But thank you.
[02:47:11.363 --> 02:47:20.470]  But in an embarrassing blow to Bush, Ryan has ordered the President's son to cease and desist from any future unsafe or unsound practices.
[02:47:20.950 --> 02:47:31.178]  Bush had no comment today, but he has steadfastly disputed charges that he voted to approve loans to his own business associates without revealing the ties to other bank directors.
[02:47:31.878 --> 02:47:34.759]  I believe in the principle that if you didn't do anything wrong, don't admit to it.
[02:47:35.179 --> 02:47:36.379]  And I didn't do anything wrong.
[02:47:36.779 --> 02:47:41.440]  Still today, there were charges from Democrats that Bush's punishment was too lenient.
[02:47:41.701 --> 02:47:44.641]  We're out a billion dollars in terms of this particular institution.
[02:47:44.681 --> 02:47:49.342]  It seems to me the least we could say is you stay out of the business for five years, you don't come back into this.
[02:47:49.663 --> 02:47:52.243]  Bush has been ordered to do nothing more than obey the law.
[02:47:52.883 --> 02:47:55.184]  This is a slap on the wrist with a velvet hammer.
[02:47:55.492 --> 02:47:58.873]  Today's action may be the least of Neil Bush's problems.
[02:47:59.233 --> 02:48:06.075]  Still pending against Silverado, a $200 million civil suit, and a federal fraud investigation.
[02:48:06.575 --> 02:48:08.676]  Rita Braver, CBS News, Washington.
[02:48:08.696 --> 02:48:09.996]  And there you go.
[02:48:10.056 --> 02:48:12.177]  Neil Bush now joins the Cruz finance team.
[02:48:14.288 --> 02:48:15.469]  The ultimate irony.
[02:48:15.489 --> 02:48:17.590]  Okay, let me go back and review some of this in more detail.
[02:48:17.610 --> 02:48:21.113]  That was a report from 1991 from CBS News.
[02:48:21.173 --> 02:48:23.374]  Now, here's something from Mother Jones.
[02:48:23.394 --> 02:48:28.278]  This is an article called Bush Family Values, and they spell values with a dollar sign, okay?
[02:48:28.858 --> 02:48:33.341]  This all revolved around Silverado banking initially from 1985 until 1988.
[02:48:33.641 --> 02:48:37.504]  This is savings and loan in Denver, Colorado.
[02:48:37.524 --> 02:48:38.725]  For those of you who don't remember,
[02:48:40.115 --> 02:48:55.665]  The SNL crisis that happened in the late 80s, early 90s, okay, that was something that was the biggest fraud that we had seen until the mid-2000s, until we came around to George W. Bush and the Federal Reserve that did the pump and dump there.
[02:48:56.205 --> 02:49:01.889]  And they put it this way, they say, Neil's abysmally unsuccessful oil company was involved there.
[02:49:01.949 --> 02:49:09.274]  They made over $200 million in loans to Neil Bush and his two partners and their unsuccessful oil company.
[02:49:09.774 --> 02:49:18.280]  Silverado's savings and loan was due at least in part to the fact that Neil's two partners welched on $135 million in loans.
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:22.843]  After Silverado failed, Neil started a new oil company, Apex Energy.
[02:49:22.863 --> 02:49:23.903]  You know, you just keep going.
[02:49:24.624 --> 02:49:28.927]  The Small Business Administration Program gave him a $2.35 million loan.
[02:49:31.226 --> 02:49:35.107]  That was arranged by an old family friend.
[02:49:35.127 --> 02:49:38.629]  This is what we call crony capitalism, boys and girls.
[02:49:38.949 --> 02:49:40.449]  Exhibit A, Neil Bush.
[02:49:41.070 --> 02:49:41.390]  Okay?
[02:49:42.530 --> 02:49:50.113]  The SBA, the Small Business Administration, discovered that the companies through which the loan was approved were technically insolvent.
[02:49:50.173 --> 02:49:50.673]  Guess what?
[02:49:51.093 --> 02:49:55.635]  The last time we checked, Apex's only known asset was an oil lease.
[02:49:56.235 --> 02:49:59.804]  Which the company had purchased from Neil Bush for $150,000 before he bailed out.
[02:50:02.379 --> 02:50:03.460]  Let me repeat this, okay?
[02:50:04.121 --> 02:50:06.543]  He creates this new oil company.
[02:50:06.923 --> 02:50:14.089]  He sells them an oil lease for $150,000, essentially worthless, along with these other assets.
[02:50:14.129 --> 02:50:20.894]  He arranges a loan for $2.5 million, roughly, through the SBA, Small Business Administration.
[02:50:21.294 --> 02:50:25.578]  And then they find out he uses family connections to make that happen.
[02:50:26.198 --> 02:50:26.859]  Let me ask you this.
[02:50:28.303 --> 02:50:38.380]  Any of you out there who would like to start your own business, be your own boss, you know, set your own hours, just get directly involved and like, you'd like to start a business.
[02:50:38.400 --> 02:50:39.542]  That's the American dream, okay?
[02:50:40.526 --> 02:50:45.050]  Let me ask you, if you go to the Small Business Administration, you think they're going to give you a $2.5 million loan?
[02:50:45.450 --> 02:50:46.271]  No, no.
[02:50:46.651 --> 02:50:47.692]  That's crony capitalism.
[02:50:48.233 --> 02:50:50.454]  How does crony capitalism succeed?
[02:50:50.474 --> 02:50:53.297]  Well, you have to have a big government to do that, Bernie.
[02:50:54.298 --> 02:50:56.359]  So yeah, it's not just crony capitalism.
[02:50:56.399 --> 02:50:57.460]  It's not capitalism at all.
[02:50:57.861 --> 02:51:00.583]  It's gangster theft, okay?
[02:51:01.063 --> 02:51:04.726]  And of course, he rolls all this over and then they say, wait a minute, there's nothing at all here.
[02:51:05.047 --> 02:51:07.969]  Now he's going to be Ted Cruz's finance manager.
[02:51:08.049 --> 02:51:08.770]  What could be better?
[02:51:09.170 --> 02:51:19.776]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[02:51:20.076 --> 02:51:23.998]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[02:51:24.238 --> 02:51:26.059]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:26.399 --> 02:51:31.862]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:32.022 --> 02:51:41.806]  What happens with the Formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:51:42.046 --> 02:51:48.309]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:51:48.549 --> 02:51:51.851]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for a diabetic.
[02:51:51.891 --> 02:51:53.712]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[02:51:53.952 --> 02:51:57.053]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[02:51:57.073 --> 02:51:59.214]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[02:52:09.967 --> 02:52:13.408]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:52:13.748 --> 02:52:20.869]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:52:21.469 --> 02:52:29.871]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:52:30.091 --> 02:52:34.192]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:52:34.512 --> 02:52:39.673]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[02:52:40.093 --> 02:52:43.955]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:52:44.335 --> 02:52:47.457]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[02:52:47.757 --> 02:52:58.863]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[02:53:08.444 --> 02:53:09.605]  Bad news, Americans.
[02:53:09.885 --> 02:53:12.546]  You're probably stockpiling for a disaster all wrong.
[02:53:12.786 --> 02:53:17.708]  When the big one comes, you'll need more than that poisonous, over-salted survival food you now see everywhere.
[02:53:17.908 --> 02:53:22.830]  There are three vital things that your survival food is missing, and it's the first thing to disappear from grocery stores.

[02:53:44.019 --> 02:53:46.540]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[02:54:15.236 --> 02:54:22.038]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:22.098 --> 02:54:23.118]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[02:54:23.178 --> 02:54:28.180]  In this last segment of the regular show, we're going to have our fourth hour extension.
[02:54:28.200 --> 02:54:32.481]  That's going to be with Rob Dew joining us in the next segment.
[02:54:33.581 --> 02:54:44.121]  Now, as I was talking before we went to break, and of course, that wonderful headline from Politico saying that the GOP establishment creeps towards Cruz, it reminded me, you know, of the committee to re-elect the president.
[02:54:44.904 --> 02:54:45.464]  Richard Nixon.
[02:54:46.424 --> 02:54:48.405]  And that acronym actually was C.R.E.A.P.
[02:54:48.945 --> 02:54:49.285]  Okay?
[02:54:49.685 --> 02:54:51.166]  The People Behind Watergate.
[02:54:51.406 --> 02:54:53.246]  And so I guess we've got a new C.R.E.A.P.
[02:54:53.426 --> 02:54:56.667]  right now going towards the current C.R.E.A.P.
[02:54:56.887 --> 02:54:58.548]  that's being presented to us, Ted Cruz.
[02:54:59.348 --> 02:55:07.630]  We've got Neil Bush, brother of George W. and Jeb, as well as 13 others are new additions to Cruz's national finance team.
[02:55:07.650 --> 02:55:12.652]  And I just reported about the stellar financial background of Neil Bush.
[02:55:14.292 --> 02:55:23.858]  Crony capitalist, you know, trading in his connections to get a sweetheart deal from the Small Business Association, getting a loan on a company that was essentially worthless.
[02:55:24.219 --> 02:55:30.903]  They say all these new additions are former supporters of other candidates like Jeb and Rand and Rick Perry and Marco Rubio.
[02:55:31.303 --> 02:55:35.686]  And now we've got Carly Fiorina also moving towards Cruz and endorsing her.
[02:55:36.086 --> 02:55:36.787]  You know her real name?
[02:55:37.367 --> 02:55:40.529]  Is Carlton Sneed Fiorina.
[02:55:41.009 --> 02:55:43.231]  Carlton Sneed Fiorina.
[02:55:43.511 --> 02:55:44.872]  Who would name their kid that?
[02:55:45.192 --> 02:55:45.552]  A girl.
[02:55:45.912 --> 02:55:56.919]  But, you know, actually, I think, you know, Carly, that kind of, you know, goes by Carly Simons, kind of chic or whatever for a certain generation, you know, but Sneed, I think, is really the name that fits the face.
[02:55:57.319 --> 02:56:01.702]  You know, when I look at Carly, I think she really ought to be sneed, Fiorina.
[02:56:01.762 --> 02:56:07.285]  She is now endorsing Cruz as well because, you know, that's what the establishment is moving toward.
[02:56:08.566 --> 02:56:11.307]  This is a clear sign, folks, of what's going on.
[02:56:11.467 --> 02:56:18.651]  It is a clear sign that they're desperate enough that they are taking the mask off of Ted Cruz.
[02:56:18.671 --> 02:56:21.713]  A mask that I've been pointing out, I think, has been there a very long time.
[02:56:21.753 --> 02:56:24.115]  Perhaps that's why he has such awkward smiles.
[02:56:24.195 --> 02:56:24.475]  I don't know.
[02:56:24.835 --> 02:56:27.036]  I want to tell you something right now that is free.
[02:56:27.576 --> 02:56:29.217]  This is something I'm selling for free.

[02:57:03.916 --> 02:57:07.358]  And one last thing I want to mention before we get to the break here.
[02:57:07.679 --> 02:57:11.501]  And as I was talking earlier about the news report that came out.
[02:57:12.285 --> 02:57:14.907]  About the drones being used to spy on us.
[02:57:16.247 --> 02:57:18.548]  Understand that they're doing more than that with the drones.
[02:57:19.389 --> 02:57:24.792]  We had a document that listed, and I was trying to find this through the show, haven't been able to find it yet.
[02:57:25.392 --> 02:57:30.815]  It was a document somebody had given us from the FAA where they listed everybody who had been licensed to have drones at the time.
[02:57:30.835 --> 02:57:34.157]  And this is before they started requiring everybody register their drones with them.
[02:57:34.870 --> 02:57:41.455]  And it was amazing to see how many different agencies, and some universities for research purposes, had drones.
[02:57:41.495 --> 02:57:47.260]  But when you look at the agencies, when you look at what the BLM has, they had a massive number of drones.
[02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:50.883]  A lot of their drones were Reaper drones and Predator drones.
[02:57:51.823 --> 02:57:57.204]  Now, they're saying that they're using these drones to map out resources.
[02:57:57.764 --> 02:57:59.685]  And that would be frightening enough.
[02:58:00.265 --> 02:58:12.548]  If we're going to live in a country where the government maps out everything that they claim they own, and of course the government is not allowed under the Constitution to own land outside the District of Columbia, but they assert ownership over all this land.
[02:58:13.148 --> 02:58:17.669]  They're going to map it out to the last detail, but they're going to map out your land to the last detail.
[02:58:18.649 --> 02:58:23.351]  And as we're looking at this, they try to say, well, you know, it's just, uh, we're just monitoring people.
[02:58:23.391 --> 02:58:24.551]  We're just looking at people.
[02:58:24.731 --> 02:58:35.375]  Understand that when this is really going to get bad, and nobody's talking about this, it is the vehicle to infrastructure communication devices that they're going to be putting in your car within the next year or two.
[02:58:35.395 --> 02:58:37.295]  They're going to be mandating that you buy that.
[02:58:37.556 --> 02:58:40.897]  They're going to be monitoring every aspect of your movement.
[02:58:40.937 --> 02:58:42.737]  They say, hey, it's just metadata.
[02:58:43.237 --> 02:58:44.658]  That's the most important data.
[02:58:45.018 --> 02:58:46.599]  That's how they map the human domain.
[02:58:46.619 --> 02:58:46.959]  Stay with us.
[02:58:46.979 --> 02:58:47.499]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:51.525 --> 02:58:55.526]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:58.787 --> 02:59:00.788]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[02:59:00.868 --> 02:59:01.908]  Try a bottle of it.
[02:59:02.108 --> 02:59:03.569]  Rob Dew joins us.
[02:59:03.689 --> 02:59:06.510]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[02:59:06.790 --> 02:59:07.850]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[02:59:07.870 --> 02:59:08.811]  I'd been working all day.
[02:59:08.831 --> 02:59:11.191]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[02:59:11.331 --> 02:59:12.332]  I get in here at 830.
[02:59:12.752 --> 02:59:14.912]  I was kind of run down, you know.
[02:59:14.953 --> 02:59:16.373]  I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[02:59:16.573 --> 02:59:18.454]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[02:59:18.474 --> 02:59:20.276]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[02:59:20.296 --> 02:59:21.076]  I popped two of them.
[02:59:21.356 --> 02:59:23.498]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[02:59:23.638 --> 02:59:25.319]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[02:59:25.419 --> 02:59:26.880]  It's got four and a half stars.
[02:59:27.080 --> 02:59:28.101]  People really love it.
[02:59:28.421 --> 02:59:28.942]  Read about it.
[02:59:29.022 --> 02:59:32.764]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[02:59:32.864 --> 02:59:38.128]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[02:59:38.308 --> 02:59:42.190]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without BrainForce.
[02:59:42.370 --> 02:59:48.153]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more BrainForce and came in.
[02:59:48.494 --> 02:59:53.776]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:53.917 --> 02:59:55.717]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:17.789 --> 03:00:21.672]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:22.613 --> 03:00:27.518]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:31.181 --> 03:00:33.023]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, the fourth hour.
[03:00:33.103 --> 03:00:35.124]  Rob Dew is going to be joining us in the next segment.
[03:00:36.351 --> 03:00:40.714]  I want to talk a little bit about a couple of articles we didn't have time to talk about earlier.
[03:00:40.814 --> 03:00:45.637]  Of course, we have many of these articles that came up on the Drudge Report earlier today.
[03:00:45.657 --> 03:00:48.598]  The Bloomberg article, The Crime You Have Not Yet Committed.
[03:00:48.819 --> 03:00:55.763]  Another one from The Guardian, The FBI Quietly Changes Its Privacy Rules for Accessing NSA Data on Americans.
[03:00:56.403 --> 03:01:00.025]  Let me read you a phrase from this, and I want you to let this sink in.
[03:01:07.435 --> 03:01:08.015]  Think about that.
[03:01:08.036 --> 03:01:08.816]  Let me repeat it.
[03:01:09.437 --> 03:01:11.218]  Classified revisions.
[03:01:11.578 --> 03:01:16.562]  Classified revisions were accepted by the secret U.S.
[03:01:16.683 --> 03:01:16.983]  court.
[03:01:18.984 --> 03:01:28.492]  What's going on here is that we have a secret court, a star chamber court, that is now secretly changing the law.
[03:01:31.274 --> 03:01:32.796]  How does it get any worse than this?
[03:01:33.917 --> 03:01:36.721]  This is anathema to democracy.
[03:01:36.741 --> 03:01:41.408]  It is everything our system of governance was designed to stop.
[03:01:42.264 --> 03:01:48.946]  The Magna Carta and the Constitution were designed to stop precisely this type of secret star chamber government.
[03:01:49.566 --> 03:01:52.546]  And the amazing thing to me is the path that we have taken to get here.
[03:01:52.646 --> 03:01:56.387]  You understand that back in the 70s we had the Church Commission in the Senate.
[03:01:56.427 --> 03:01:58.188]  We had the Pike Commission in the House.
[03:01:58.788 --> 03:02:00.388]  What were they doing there?
[03:02:00.608 --> 03:02:04.869]  They were trying to get control of this secret government that was rising up.
[03:02:04.969 --> 03:02:07.630]  The CIA was really kind of the focus of the Church Commission.
[03:02:08.210 --> 03:02:13.476]  And we've all seen the pictures of the heart attack gun and the other assassination things that the CIA was doing.
[03:02:13.516 --> 03:02:20.485]  It's like, wait a minute, we don't want a government that secretly assassinates political leaders and perhaps its dissidents within its own country.
[03:02:20.505 --> 03:02:21.406]  Okay?
[03:02:21.566 --> 03:02:24.129]  Or even government officials within its own government.
[03:02:24.569 --> 03:02:25.929]  We don't want that, okay?
[03:02:25.989 --> 03:02:34.611]  Meanwhile, the Pike Commission, which was in the House, was trying to get some information on the NSA, and they called the director of the NSA in, and he at first wouldn't come in, and then he comes in.
[03:02:34.631 --> 03:02:36.032]  They said, we'd like to see your charter.
[03:02:36.172 --> 03:02:38.432]  You know, CIA has a charter.
[03:02:38.472 --> 03:02:39.492]  Where's your charter, NSA?
[03:02:39.572 --> 03:02:41.673]  And he said, well, it's classified.
[03:02:41.693 --> 03:02:43.593]  I'm not going to show it to you, Congressman.
[03:02:45.074 --> 03:02:45.574]  Congressman?
[03:02:46.154 --> 03:02:50.735]  NSA was created by a secret executive order by President Truman.
[03:02:51.977 --> 03:02:59.762]  And within a couple of decades, they had been doing the same kind of stuff that everybody's complaining about now, that Snowden has illustrated to the public.
[03:03:00.302 --> 03:03:07.566]  Spying on Americans, listening to their phone calls, doing all the stuff that is prohibited by the Constitution.
[03:03:07.927 --> 03:03:19.714]  And so these two commissions came in and said, well, okay, I can't, you know, I can just imagine them sitting there like Senator Sessions when the guy who was the guy, I want to say Panera, Panetta.
[03:03:21.493 --> 03:03:29.776]  Panera says, yeah, we would go to the UN or we would go to NATO to get authority to call for a no-fly zone over Syria.
[03:03:29.796 --> 03:03:31.176]  And he goes, I can't believe you're saying that.
[03:03:31.216 --> 03:03:31.837]  You're a senator.
[03:03:31.877 --> 03:03:32.877]  You know what the Constitution is.
[03:03:32.897 --> 03:03:33.877]  They could care less.
[03:03:34.377 --> 03:03:38.119]  OK, so these secret organizations, the NSA says, we're not going to show you our charter.
[03:03:38.139 --> 03:03:39.279]  It's secret.
[03:03:39.379 --> 03:03:40.219]  It's an executive order.
[03:03:40.259 --> 03:03:41.320]  You can't see it, Congressman.
[03:03:41.800 --> 03:03:46.501]  And so they said, all right, we're going to create an organization to oversee these guys, to try to keep them in check.
[03:03:46.521 --> 03:03:47.682]  We'll call it the FISA.
[03:03:48.496 --> 03:03:50.877]  Or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
[03:03:51.157 --> 03:03:52.177]  We're going to set up a court.
[03:03:52.637 --> 03:03:54.538]  And we're going to keep these guys in line.
[03:03:54.638 --> 03:03:54.898]  Okay?
[03:03:55.078 --> 03:03:56.058]  Now what are they doing?
[03:03:56.438 --> 03:04:00.699]  They're using that court to secretly modify the Constitution.
[03:04:00.719 --> 03:04:02.320]  We've reported on this multiple times.
[03:04:02.360 --> 03:04:03.660]  Here it is again from The Guardian.
[03:04:04.140 --> 03:04:05.561]  Classified revisions.
[03:04:05.621 --> 03:04:06.641]  We can't see them.
[03:04:07.401 --> 03:04:08.523]  Not for the public to see.
[03:04:08.763 --> 03:04:11.887]  They're changing the Constitution and they say you can't see it.
[03:04:12.007 --> 03:04:12.588]  It's a secret.
[03:04:12.648 --> 03:04:23.201]  Meanwhile, we have Hillary Clinton who is putting all of these thousands of secret documents on her private server for who knows what reason she would set this thing up.
[03:04:24.195 --> 03:04:29.656]  Why did she hatch this conspiracy to subvert the religion of the national security state?
[03:04:30.056 --> 03:04:44.060]  The thing on which we have to sacrifice our constitution and all of our individual rights for this national security state, and Hillary Clinton conspires with others who are now being given immunity to investigate this and understand
[03:04:44.980 --> 03:04:50.023]  Judge Napolitano went on and he pointed out, hey, you give somebody immunity, that means you're going after somebody higher up.
[03:04:50.043 --> 03:04:53.404]  He also said, yesterday he said, she's playing word games.
[03:04:53.444 --> 03:04:55.105]  She says, none of these things are marked classified.
[03:04:55.145 --> 03:04:56.666]  Of course they're not marked classified.
[03:04:56.686 --> 03:05:00.647]  They're marked confidential, or they're marked secret, or they're marked top secret.
[03:05:00.667 --> 03:05:01.828]  They don't write classified.
[03:05:02.048 --> 03:05:02.928]  They write those other things.
[03:05:03.028 --> 03:05:04.569]  It's a word game, just like her husband.
[03:05:04.609 --> 03:05:05.029]  Stay with us.
[03:05:05.049 --> 03:05:06.230]  We'll be right back with Rob Dew.
[03:05:08.792 --> 03:05:17.236]  In the last Democratic debate, we learned that there are no poor white people, and that Hillary Clinton single-handedly saved the auto industry.
[03:05:17.456 --> 03:05:19.237]  What will we learn this time around?
[03:05:19.857 --> 03:05:21.878]  First, they wouldn't debate at all.
[03:05:22.218 --> 03:05:26.000]  Then, only during NFL playoff games or Christmas Eve.
[03:05:26.320 --> 03:05:29.321]  Well, finally, the moment you've been waiting for is here.

[03:09:06.311 --> 03:09:07.251]  I am Rob Doo, your host.
[03:09:07.952 --> 03:09:11.073]  About halfway through this fourth hour, I'm going to have Leanne McAdoo in studio.
[03:09:11.093 --> 03:09:12.274]  We're going to be taking your calls.
[03:09:12.294 --> 03:09:13.695]  I'm going to give out the number right now, 800-259-9231.
[03:09:13.715 --> 03:09:13.755]  800-259-9231.
[03:09:13.775 --> 03:09:14.955]  Let's start the little studio login.
[03:09:24.136 --> 03:09:26.657]  Application and what are we going to talk about today?
[03:09:26.697 --> 03:09:33.958]  Well, there's been some interesting news having to deal with Sandy Hook and Donald Trump and the connection they're trying.
[03:09:33.998 --> 03:09:37.059]  I guess they're going to try to turn Donald Trump into a Sandy Hook truther.
[03:09:37.079 --> 03:09:40.460]  I'm going to show you a video in a little bit.
[03:09:41.340 --> 03:09:44.440]  Is this the most powerful Donald Trump video ever?
[03:09:45.061 --> 03:09:48.121]  And it's a pro-Trump montage by In The Fed Facebook.
[03:09:48.501 --> 03:09:50.322]  And let me tell you, I'm really hot on this right now.
[03:09:50.362 --> 03:09:50.822]  Last night,
[03:09:51.862 --> 03:09:57.923]  Biggs and I, Joe Biggs, and a few others were at a local bar where we've been competing in a ping-pong tournament.
[03:09:58.924 --> 03:10:02.944]  We're pretty crazy about ping-pong here, at least some of us at the InfoWars studios.
[03:10:03.364 --> 03:10:12.586]  You might have seen, I think me and Biggs, Biggs dressed up as an ISIS fighter and I was dressed up as Uncle Sam and we played some ping-pong one time during the money bomb.
[03:10:14.707 --> 03:10:18.928]  Nevertheless, we did this, we have this contest and the first time we
[03:10:20.928 --> 03:10:21.288]  We did it.
[03:10:21.368 --> 03:10:21.749]  I won.
[03:10:21.789 --> 03:10:28.093]  I beat a guy wearing a commie red shirt and it had like linen and Stalin and everybody had party hats on.
[03:10:28.113 --> 03:10:32.576]  It had a little sickle and hammer and I really enjoyed beating that guy and I was wearing my Mulan Labe t-shirt.
[03:10:32.956 --> 03:10:35.038]  So it was a clash of civilizations there.
[03:10:35.078 --> 03:10:38.300]  Well, the same thing happened again this last time.
[03:10:40.422 --> 03:10:46.306]  Basically, we sent the Trinity's home packing and then they got mad and we had arguments at the end of the night at the bar.
[03:10:46.326 --> 03:10:46.746]  It was great.
[03:10:46.966 --> 03:10:47.546]  Good fun, though.
[03:10:47.566 --> 03:10:52.349]  It was good to debate people because they were throwing out, Donald Trump's a racist, he's a bigot.
[03:10:52.369 --> 03:10:53.169]  I said, well, why?
[03:10:53.369 --> 03:10:53.589]  Why?
[03:10:53.809 --> 03:10:54.370]  Why do you say that?
[03:10:54.950 --> 03:10:56.171]  He doesn't want to bring in any Muslims.
[03:10:56.531 --> 03:11:06.636]  Well, look at the results of the Michigan race last night, where Donald Trump won in Dearborn, which is, if you've driven around in Dearborn, it's a Muslim town.
[03:11:07.136 --> 03:11:15.140]  I mean, majority of the Muslims, I've been there a couple times when back in the day we went to Detroit to document the decimation that's going on there.
[03:11:15.160 --> 03:11:16.940]  We also went to Dearborn to document some stuff.
[03:11:17.361 --> 03:11:24.164]  The guys recently went back there to film like one of the biggest mosques in, I think, the United States.
[03:11:24.224 --> 03:11:25.164]  This thing is huge.
[03:11:25.644 --> 03:11:28.586]  So, big Muslim population voting for Trump.
[03:11:29.006 --> 03:11:29.966]  That must tell you something.
[03:11:30.006 --> 03:11:31.447]  They obviously don't think he's racist.
[03:11:31.827 --> 03:11:33.548]  You have a lot of Mexican-Americans voting for Trump.
[03:11:34.168 --> 03:11:35.530]  Are showing their support for Trump.
[03:11:35.850 --> 03:11:36.911]  Obviously, they don't think he's racist.
[03:11:37.292 --> 03:11:42.898]  So let's go now to is this the most powerful Donald Trump video ever?
[03:11:44.160 --> 03:11:46.522]  Mr. Trump, you've done great things in your life.
[03:11:47.043 --> 03:11:50.627]  And I just wonder how do I as an average person begin?
[03:11:52.135 --> 03:11:54.516]  Well, first of all, never think of yourself as average.
[03:11:54.596 --> 03:11:56.736]  You started off with the wrong question.
[03:11:57.216 --> 03:11:58.277]  Because you're not average.
[03:11:58.357 --> 03:11:59.317]  You've got a lot going.
[03:11:59.377 --> 03:12:00.097]  I see you're smart.
[03:12:00.157 --> 03:12:01.197]  I see you're very beautiful.
[03:12:01.377 --> 03:12:04.818]  What we were able to do today was allow people to see his heart for themselves.
[03:12:05.358 --> 03:12:07.319]  And to make up their own minds about him.
[03:12:07.759 --> 03:12:12.920]  And they find out that he's not the person that the media has depicted him to be.
[03:12:13.200 --> 03:12:14.201]  Are you in Jordan?
[03:12:14.241 --> 03:12:16.202]  I support Donald Trump and everybody knows.
[03:12:16.482 --> 03:12:17.243]  Everybody knows.
[03:12:17.263 --> 03:12:18.824]  100% I know Donald forever.
[03:12:18.884 --> 03:12:20.885]  I like Donald very much.
[03:12:20.945 --> 03:12:21.865]  He's a wonderful guy.
[03:12:22.086 --> 03:12:22.406]  He is.
[03:12:22.866 --> 03:12:24.587]  And he's miscast by the media.
[03:12:24.627 --> 03:12:25.087]  You know that.
[03:12:25.768 --> 03:12:26.868]  Oh, I like Donald.
[03:12:26.949 --> 03:12:29.110]  He's got an enormous ego, but he's a good guy.
[03:12:29.130 --> 03:12:31.171]  He's got a big heart, by the way.
[03:12:31.211 --> 03:12:32.452]  He's very good to people.
[03:12:32.492 --> 03:12:34.673]  He's very kind to people.
[03:12:34.773 --> 03:12:35.574]  People don't know that.
[03:12:36.573 --> 03:12:42.077]  You just have to get that word average out of your vocabulary and you have to tell yourself that you're great and you have to believe it.
[03:12:42.357 --> 03:12:44.779]  If you can say it and don't believe it, it doesn't matter.
[03:12:44.799 --> 03:12:47.360]  A kid that worked in the back.
[03:12:47.500 --> 03:12:47.781]  Right.
[03:12:47.981 --> 03:12:49.722]  I said, hey, how is Donald Trump?
[03:12:49.762 --> 03:12:50.643]  This is before he ran.
[03:12:50.823 --> 03:12:51.403]  This is months ago.
[03:12:51.423 --> 03:12:52.724]  He goes, unbelievable.
[03:12:52.764 --> 03:12:57.848]  He would come backstage, come back to the kitchen and give $100 to the staff.
[03:12:57.868 --> 03:12:58.248]  Yeah.
[03:12:58.428 --> 03:12:59.929]  He would give these guys quietly.
[03:12:59.949 --> 03:13:01.050]  Nobody would know about that.
[03:13:01.070 --> 03:13:01.230]  Amazing.
[03:13:01.730 --> 03:13:07.277]  The fact is, I go down the streets of New York and the people that really like me are the taxi drivers and the workers, etc, etc.
[03:13:07.478 --> 03:13:08.259]  Also his children.
[03:13:08.980 --> 03:13:11.062]  I know his son Eric, I've met him a couple of times.
[03:13:11.683 --> 03:13:12.344]  He's a great kid.
[03:13:12.704 --> 03:13:13.806]  They're great kids.
[03:13:14.246 --> 03:13:15.928]  You know, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
[03:13:16.329 --> 03:13:17.010]  Do you like him?
[03:13:20.055 --> 03:13:21.075]  I like his ideas.
[03:13:21.335 --> 03:13:22.375]  Those are real letters.
[03:13:22.415 --> 03:13:23.596]  Those are not corporate letters.
[03:13:23.976 --> 03:13:25.237]  Those are not letters from Exxon.
[03:13:25.257 --> 03:13:26.077]  These are handwritten.
[03:13:26.337 --> 03:13:28.538]  Those are not letters from General Motors.
[03:13:28.558 --> 03:13:29.899]  Those are letters from people.
[03:13:30.099 --> 03:13:30.899]  You have to have heart.
[03:13:30.939 --> 03:13:34.080]  You have to take care of women's health issues.
[03:13:34.100 --> 03:13:38.542]  You have to take care of poor people that don't have, that they're never gonna have a shot.
[03:13:39.282 --> 03:13:44.484]  And you have to take care of African-American youth who have never been in a worse position than they are right now.
[03:13:44.505 --> 03:13:45.105]  This sounds like
[03:13:45.845 --> 03:13:49.587]  Political presidential talk to me, and I know people have talked to you about whether or not you want to run.
[03:13:50.247 --> 03:13:50.747]  Would you ever?
[03:13:51.428 --> 03:13:53.109]  I just probably wouldn't do it, Oprah.
[03:13:53.149 --> 03:13:56.390]  I probably wouldn't, but I do get tired of seeing what's happening with this country.
[03:13:56.410 --> 03:13:59.151]  And if it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally.
[03:13:59.191 --> 03:14:03.173]  I think Donald Trump, underneath it all, isn't just a business guy.
[03:14:03.494 --> 03:14:04.374]  I think he loves America.
[03:14:05.131 --> 03:14:05.611]  I really do.
[03:14:05.631 --> 03:14:06.412]  I think he cares.
[03:14:06.652 --> 03:14:07.893]  This country has such potential.
[03:14:07.933 --> 03:14:09.134]  I love the country.
[03:14:09.194 --> 03:14:11.815]  I think we can make it better than ever before.
[03:14:12.316 --> 03:14:13.376]  We have to unleash it.
[03:14:13.456 --> 03:14:15.158]  People have lost their spirit.
[03:14:15.578 --> 03:14:20.061]  Donald Trump represents truth, logic, and common sense.
[03:14:20.781 --> 03:14:26.525]  His incentive and his self-interest is tied to the well-being of the country that he's supposed to represent.
[03:14:26.925 --> 03:14:27.585]  They love me.
[03:14:27.746 --> 03:14:28.366]  I love them.
[03:14:28.666 --> 03:14:29.467]  And I'll tell you something.
[03:14:29.507 --> 03:14:32.148]  If I get the nomination, I'll win the Latino vote.
[03:14:32.308 --> 03:14:32.869]  I will win it.
[03:14:33.169 --> 03:14:34.370]  Because I'm going to create jobs.
[03:14:35.010 --> 03:14:37.472]  I know.
[03:15:01.835 --> 03:15:11.162]  What Donald Trump is doing is representing the absolute heartbreak and anger and frustration at a government gone mad.
[03:15:11.422 --> 03:15:16.807]  I guess I just wanted to find out if there was one thing that you wanted people to remember about Donald Trump.
[03:15:16.887 --> 03:15:17.327]  What is it?
[03:15:17.867 --> 03:15:19.709]  Never ever give up.
[03:15:23.752 --> 03:15:29.016]  The power of positive thinking and I think that's very much in Donald's makeup.
[03:15:30.430 --> 03:15:33.892]  If I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
[03:15:34.513 --> 03:15:42.118]  I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be, to make America rich again and to make America great again.
[03:15:42.278 --> 03:15:53.366]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am officially running for President of the United States
[03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:59.022]  And we are going to make our country great again!
[03:15:59.523 --> 03:16:07.647]  Do not underestimate the power of Donald Trump, or you will be scratching your head wondering, how did he get the Republican nomination?
[03:16:07.807 --> 03:16:10.409]  And we will see the best debate in history.
[03:16:10.549 --> 03:16:12.710]  Hillary Rodham Clinton, Donald J. Trump.
[03:16:13.476 --> 03:16:15.317]  We are here to stay.
[03:16:16.078 --> 03:16:19.180]  Donald Trump on the way.
[03:16:19.621 --> 03:16:26.606]  Donald Trump has came up with some very strict immigration laws that would guarantee work in the African American community.
[03:16:26.626 --> 03:16:30.069]  I hope he gets through with his intentions about building the wall.
[03:16:30.689 --> 03:16:35.334]  Well, I just want to let everybody know that not all Latinos are blind.
[03:16:35.694 --> 03:16:43.822]  He knows what money is, where it comes from, and how to make more of it, rather than redistributing other people's in exchange for their vote.
[03:16:43.902 --> 03:16:50.168]  And the intensity with Trump is like nothing I've seen since I was a little kid and Reagan was running.
[03:16:50.248 --> 03:16:52.270]  And they were saying, this is America's last shot.
[03:16:53.266 --> 03:16:56.148]  If we don't get it right this time, we're not gonna have a country left for us.
[03:16:56.168 --> 03:16:57.149]  We're not gonna have a time.
[03:16:57.570 --> 03:17:01.673]  Are we seriously trying to figure out whether or not Donald Trump would make a good president?
[03:17:02.033 --> 03:17:05.396]  The man has major, major skills that he can offer.
[03:17:05.416 --> 03:17:13.002]  This country, right now, owes 19 trillion dollars and they need somebody like me to straighten out that mess.
[03:17:16.705 --> 03:17:17.946]  Honestly, I really think
[03:17:18.869 --> 03:17:27.498]  Voters and Americans are looking at this guy saying, it's refreshing to hear somebody not be a wuss, not be a politician, and really say what they think.
[03:17:27.558 --> 03:17:28.659]  These aren't dumb people.
[03:17:28.999 --> 03:17:31.842]  These are American patriots, and they want this country turned around.
[03:17:32.122 --> 03:17:34.144]  I don't want nuance, I want bold colors.
[03:17:34.364 --> 03:17:35.265]  Red, white, and blue.
[03:17:35.605 --> 03:17:39.709]  America I have seen in the last several decades absolutely fray and decline.
[03:17:39.809 --> 03:17:43.113]  When I saw those guys on the boats, on their knees,
[03:17:44.301 --> 03:17:48.142]  I mean, that says a picture about America that I haven't seen ever before.
[03:17:48.642 --> 03:17:54.883]  Democrats, not one or two, but many, are voting for Donald Trump, as well as Republicans.
[03:17:54.963 --> 03:17:56.604]  I've seen this all over the place.
[03:17:57.344 --> 03:18:02.025]  So I think there's a big, big movement happening, and I gotta say that, you know, we need him.
[03:18:03.025 --> 03:18:04.345]  You know, this is a movement, folks.
[03:18:04.385 --> 03:18:06.366]  This is not, like, even maybe about me.
[03:18:06.746 --> 03:18:07.866]  I don't want it to be about me.
[03:18:08.446 --> 03:18:09.786]  This is about common sense.
[03:18:10.087 --> 03:18:11.947]  It's about doing the right thing.
[03:18:13.953 --> 03:18:18.597]  The silent majority is back, and we're gonna take the country back!
[03:18:21.280 --> 03:18:25.444]  I have a big heart, I'm gonna take care of people, I'm gonna make sure that this country comes first.
[03:18:25.704 --> 03:18:27.746]  We don't come first, we don't come tenth.
[03:18:27.786 --> 03:18:30.889]  We take care of everyone else but our own, and that's gonna change.
[03:18:31.769 --> 03:18:38.696]  We're gonna become rich again, we're gonna become safe again, and we're gonna become strong again.
[03:18:39.687 --> 03:18:41.010]  Nothing is wrong with us.
[03:18:41.350 --> 03:18:43.314]  We don't have to like illegal aliens.
[03:18:44.216 --> 03:18:45.178]  We don't have to.
[03:18:45.459 --> 03:18:46.401]  We're Americans.
[03:18:46.461 --> 03:18:47.703]  We want Americans first.
[03:18:48.665 --> 03:18:49.888]  Why can't we be first?
[03:18:53.058 --> 03:18:54.920]  We are ready for a change.
[03:18:55.040 --> 03:18:58.783]  We are ready and our troops deserve the best.
[03:18:59.804 --> 03:19:03.247]  And in the Middle East, I guess we've spent five trillion dollars.
[03:19:03.787 --> 03:19:09.252]  We could have rebuilt our bridges, our tunnels, our roads, our hospitals, our airports.
[03:19:09.572 --> 03:19:11.613]  We could have rebuilt our country.
[03:19:11.954 --> 03:19:13.575]  We could have rebuilt our military.
[03:19:13.835 --> 03:19:16.297]  We could have taken care of Social Security.
[03:19:16.658 --> 03:19:19.240]  We could have taken care of everything.
[03:19:20.598 --> 03:19:22.539]  We are going to win so much.
[03:19:22.639 --> 03:19:24.841]  We're going to have win after win after win.
[03:19:24.861 --> 03:19:27.742]  You people are going to get sick and tired of winning.
[03:19:27.762 --> 03:19:35.347]  You're going to say, please, please, President Trump, we can't take this much victory.
[03:19:35.407 --> 03:19:35.747]  Please stop.
[03:19:35.767 --> 03:19:36.768]  We don't want any more wins.
[03:19:36.868 --> 03:19:38.689]  And I'm going to say to you, we're going to win.
[03:19:38.709 --> 03:19:40.270]  I don't care what you say.
[03:19:40.590 --> 03:19:44.032]  We're going to make our country great again.
[03:19:44.432 --> 03:19:45.973]  We're going to win.
[03:19:46.033 --> 03:19:46.934]  We're going to win.
[03:19:47.054 --> 03:19:48.455]  And we're going to win.
[03:20:12.188 --> 03:20:18.652]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a SelectQuote agent with a true story of how SelectQuote goes to bat for you buying term life insurance.
[03:20:19.613 --> 03:20:22.375]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:20:23.195 --> 03:20:26.898]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:20:27.558 --> 03:20:28.799]  I said, let me see.
[03:20:29.379 --> 03:20:39.963]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly-rated, price-competitive companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[03:20:40.443 --> 03:20:51.588]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.

[03:24:15.393 --> 03:24:20.555]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell, but I've been seen with Farrah.
[03:24:20.615 --> 03:24:26.218]  Well, the great thing about the Alex Jones Show, you never know who's going to drop on by the studio.
[03:24:26.338 --> 03:24:34.401]  You may have heard and seen the trailer of Amerageddon, the movie that Alex Jones has a pretty big role in as an evil senator.
[03:24:34.842 --> 03:24:37.383]  Well, I've got sitting next to me, not Leanne McAdoo,
[03:24:38.143 --> 03:24:46.353]  But Gary Haven, the writer and producer of Amerigheddon, just dropped by and so he decided to come in and we're going to spend the next half hour with him.
[03:24:46.373 --> 03:24:47.334]  We're going to take your phone calls.
[03:24:47.394 --> 03:24:53.542]  I got Kevin in Florida, Antoine in California, Wayne in Kansas, Austin in Oklahoma.
[03:24:53.962 --> 03:24:54.543]  That's interesting.
[03:24:54.643 --> 03:24:55.544]  And Jerome in Texas.
[03:24:56.044 --> 03:25:00.048]  And we'll take more calls as we go along through the rest of the fourth hour.
[03:25:00.689 --> 03:25:09.658]  But it was interesting, I was talking to Gary back in the conference room that we have, sort of our green room, and he was talking about some interesting things that are going on with North Korea.
[03:25:10.519 --> 03:25:18.482]  I don't know if you've been watching or paying attention to that, but there is some saber-rattling going on amongst all the Trump hoopla that's going on in the United States.
[03:25:19.162 --> 03:25:31.285]  And oh, before we go to that and start talking about that, I want to just give a quick plug to in the Fed Facebook group who played that last video or who produced that last video that we that we just played about Donald Trump.
[03:25:31.766 --> 03:25:32.366]  And I think
[03:25:33.206 --> 03:25:37.008]  You know, you can't deny the crowds that Donald Trump is getting.
[03:25:37.489 --> 03:25:38.329]  Same as Bernie Sanders.
[03:25:38.369 --> 03:25:39.330]  He's getting good crowds.
[03:25:40.611 --> 03:25:42.232]  The crowds are crickets for everybody else.
[03:25:42.252 --> 03:25:44.353]  Ted Cruz is getting some crowds, but not like Donald.
[03:25:45.074 --> 03:25:45.934]  Not like Sanders.
[03:25:46.134 --> 03:25:48.436]  Hillary, they get smaller and smaller.
[03:25:48.516 --> 03:25:50.097]  Rubio, they get smaller and smaller.
[03:25:50.117 --> 03:25:51.158]  I mean, what do you think's going on?
[03:25:51.858 --> 03:25:54.202]  You know, Trump's a mess, right?
[03:25:54.543 --> 03:25:56.085]  But he's his own mess.
[03:25:56.125 --> 03:25:59.270]  He's not bought and paid for by the elite, the establishment.
[03:25:59.891 --> 03:26:02.355]  And the reality is people are waking up.
[03:26:02.696 --> 03:26:04.299]  They want their country back.
[03:26:05.260 --> 03:26:13.447]  And Trump is somebody who gives us hope that we could have a leader that will actually stand for us and not for the establishment.
[03:26:13.787 --> 03:26:15.729]  And I think help get government out of the way.
[03:26:17.110 --> 03:26:18.671]  I see that as being the biggest problem.
[03:26:18.691 --> 03:26:20.152]  People think the government's there to help you.
[03:26:20.453 --> 03:26:20.893]  They're not.
[03:26:21.073 --> 03:26:23.555]  They get in the way of everything.
[03:26:23.715 --> 03:26:24.836]  They got in the way in Katrina.
[03:26:24.876 --> 03:26:29.140]  People were trying to send water to these people and the government was getting in the way saying, no, you can't send people water.
[03:26:29.760 --> 03:26:31.582]  But come on, it's water.
[03:26:32.267 --> 03:26:35.909]  You know, the government gets in the way of giving people water when they need water.
[03:26:35.929 --> 03:26:36.650]  Okay?
[03:26:36.870 --> 03:26:37.790]  That's the government.
[03:26:38.171 --> 03:26:39.852]  And that was a George Bush administration.
[03:26:40.252 --> 03:26:40.512]  Okay?
[03:26:41.373 --> 03:26:42.674]  Barack Obama wasn't any better.
[03:26:42.694 --> 03:26:45.896]  I mean, these people, they get in the way.
[03:26:46.156 --> 03:26:47.737]  And the government keeps getting bigger and bigger.
[03:26:47.997 --> 03:26:49.158]  We need smaller government.
[03:26:49.418 --> 03:26:51.999]  We have the technology now to communicate.
[03:26:53.180 --> 03:26:54.361]  Pretty instantaneously.
[03:26:54.621 --> 03:26:59.503]  Just since I've gotten here, the news, I mean, we are on like, if it's two days old, it's old.
[03:26:59.883 --> 03:27:01.224]  We don't even talk about it anymore.
[03:27:01.524 --> 03:27:05.106]  Whereas before it would be something a week old, would still be kind of big news.
[03:27:05.406 --> 03:27:06.186]  Now, not anymore.
[03:27:06.487 --> 03:27:08.548]  I mean, it's so, it's flying so fast and furious.
[03:27:08.588 --> 03:27:18.332]  If you're connected with one of these, uh, one of these listening devices, you know, what's, you know, you might know what's going on depending on what, depending on where you get your news from and how many sources you go to.
[03:27:18.712 --> 03:27:19.633]  You go to InfoWars, don't you?
[03:27:19.813 --> 03:27:22.734]  Yeah, every morning I begin my day.
[03:27:23.034 --> 03:27:24.115]  How else would I know what's going on?
[03:27:24.195 --> 03:27:24.715]  There you go.
[03:27:24.775 --> 03:27:25.936]  So let's get into North Korea.
[03:27:25.956 --> 03:27:31.038]  We've got a short segment, but we're going back into an 18-minute segment after the break.
[03:27:31.258 --> 03:27:36.200]  So, North Korea, you were talking about how your film has got some parallels with what's going on right now.
[03:27:36.240 --> 03:27:37.401]  And you wrote this when?
[03:27:37.421 --> 03:27:38.141]  A year and a half ago?
[03:27:38.161 --> 03:27:39.181]  Yeah, a year and a half ago.
[03:27:39.201 --> 03:27:44.183]  The movie's called Amerigeddon, and we have a website, amerigeddonthemovie.com.
[03:27:45.084 --> 03:27:47.445]  Over a million and a half people have seen the trailer.
[03:27:47.925 --> 03:27:55.693]  You know, when we were writing this movie, we had several ways to emulate this EMP attack on America.
[03:27:56.234 --> 03:28:07.004]  And what that is, is a detonation of a small nuclear device up in the atmosphere, and it sends out gamma rays that will destroy all electronics, including the grid, water systems, and
[03:28:07.865 --> 03:28:16.411]  And I looked at the most likely way we'd get this attack, and would it be a Scud missile with an EMP on it from a freighter and all that sort of thing?
[03:28:16.771 --> 03:28:21.114]  Well, we just happened to choose the most likely scenario, which is a North Korean satellite.
[03:28:21.750 --> 03:28:22.290]  And guess what?
[03:28:22.691 --> 03:28:27.994]  February 7th, not many weeks ago, North Korea launched a satellite that passes over the U.S.
[03:28:28.114 --> 03:28:29.075]  three times a day.
[03:28:29.735 --> 03:28:39.281]  North Korea has been developing miniaturized nuclear devices that are low-detonation, high-gamma-ray production, specifically for EMP.
[03:28:40.562 --> 03:28:44.446]  So all of this is in the news every week right now.
[03:28:44.526 --> 03:28:46.127]  You've got a new story on it today.
[03:28:48.369 --> 03:28:56.237]  I'm almost worried that this is going to happen before my movie comes out that might actually give people a chance to be warned.
[03:28:56.477 --> 03:28:56.717]  Right.
[03:28:56.977 --> 03:28:57.718]  And it comes out when?
[03:28:57.778 --> 03:28:58.318]  In May, right?
[03:28:58.378 --> 03:28:58.519]  May 13.
[03:28:59.099 --> 03:28:59.239]  May 13.
[03:28:59.799 --> 03:29:02.802]  Theaters across Texas and in Southern U.S.
[03:29:03.402 --> 03:29:05.924]  Directors Mike Norris, son of Chuck Norris.
[03:29:07.305 --> 03:29:10.167]  I co-wrote the movie with him and star in it.
[03:29:10.327 --> 03:29:11.648]  And do you have a theatrical degree?
[03:29:12.948 --> 03:29:14.969]  It takes a lot of work to put a movie together.
[03:29:14.989 --> 03:29:15.770]  I know that.
[03:29:15.950 --> 03:29:17.171]  It's funny, I've never acted.
[03:29:17.191 --> 03:29:27.556]  This is my second movie, but I actually found that it was a very natural thing for me to do, and especially about something you're passionate about.
[03:29:27.916 --> 03:29:28.156]  Right.
[03:29:28.236 --> 03:29:30.317]  Well, I'm going to get into some acting stuff later.
[03:29:30.577 --> 03:29:33.257]  The break is coming upon us.
[03:29:34.038 --> 03:29:42.700]  The Daily Mail is attacking Donald Trump for being endorsed by Reverend Carl Gallups, who they claim is the Sandy Hook truth-teller who says no one died in the Newtown shootings.
[03:29:43.600 --> 03:29:44.600]  Sandy Hook's a little weird.
[03:29:45.861 --> 03:29:52.562]  But we're going to get more into North Korea, and we've got a little video about North Korea, because they are threatening to launch preemptive nuclear strikes.
[03:29:52.682 --> 03:29:53.363]  Believe it, people.
[03:29:53.663 --> 03:29:54.323]  It could be happening.
[03:29:55.264 --> 03:29:55.705]  There it is.
[03:29:55.785 --> 03:29:56.126]  RobDew.
[03:29:56.186 --> 03:29:57.108]  Infowars.com.
[03:29:57.148 --> 03:29:57.770]  You're watching it.
[03:29:57.790 --> 03:29:58.652]  We're on the march.
[03:29:59.133 --> 03:30:00.737]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:30:01.680 --> 03:30:04.366]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.171 --> 03:30:09.711]  400 U.S.
[03:30:09.751 --> 03:30:22.454]  Army soldiers at Fort Gordon, Georgia, were subjected to a so-called white privilege briefing, including a PowerPoint presentation instructing the attendees, our society attaches privilege to being white and male and heterosexual.
[03:30:22.634 --> 03:30:30.616]  The slideshow, obtained by Judicial Watch, also informed the soldiers, quote, race privilege gives whites little reason to pay a lot of attention to African Americans.
[03:30:30.936 --> 03:30:38.640]  The White Privilege Training also claimed there are unspecified powerful forces everywhere, keeping different kinds of people from being valued, accepted, and appreciated.
[03:30:38.921 --> 03:30:40.842]  But we act as if it doesn't exist.
[03:30:41.122 --> 03:30:46.105]  This alleged privilege creates a yawning divide in income, wealth, and dignity, the slideshow suggested.
[03:30:46.445 --> 03:30:51.948]  But obviously, this White Privilege Training course helps perpetrate this racial divide in America by fueling racial tensions.
[03:30:52.188 --> 03:31:02.262]  This very notion that you can group people into racial groups who have certain privileges is racist in itself, because then you're not looking at people by their individual qualities, but rather by their skin color, which is inherently racist.
[03:31:02.603 --> 03:31:06.549]  This is Kit Daniels, and check back at InfoWars.com for more news and reports.
[03:31:08.612 --> 03:31:11.814]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:31:12.134 --> 03:31:20.159]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:31:20.379 --> 03:31:25.423]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[03:32:09.694 --> 03:32:13.096]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:32:13.456 --> 03:32:20.580]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:32:21.200 --> 03:32:29.544]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:32:29.844 --> 03:32:33.966]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:32:34.226 --> 03:32:38.909]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our
[03:32:39.329 --> 03:32:39.689]  I'm good.
[03:33:21.286 --> 03:33:26.452]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:33:26.952 --> 03:33:29.214]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:33:32.247 --> 03:33:36.411]  That's right you're here at the tip of the spear every day Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[03:33:36.591 --> 03:33:37.772]  to now 3 p.m.
[03:33:38.112 --> 03:33:56.328]  with the fourth hour of overdrive that we've been doing here for about I don't know six months now it's been quite an experiment to pick up the fourth hour again Alex used to do four hours and he went back down to three and then you know people were still carrying they would repeat the first hour they'd keep that four hour spot open so Alex said why don't we just keep producing more content we have the staff we have people that can come in and
[03:33:56.688 --> 03:33:59.510]  I'm not one of the main people that sits in and does this.
[03:33:59.570 --> 03:34:05.234]  Mainly, you know, David Knight and Anthony does Thursdays and we have Paul Joseph Watson on Mondays.
[03:34:05.294 --> 03:34:10.237]  But as news breaks, as people get assigned to different areas, you know, other people have to step up.
[03:34:10.557 --> 03:34:12.979]  So I'm going to go to your calls this segment, definitely.
[03:34:13.099 --> 03:34:13.699]  I think we'll go to...
[03:34:15.921 --> 03:34:19.323]  We'll go to Austin and Oklahoma first, so stand by Austin.
[03:34:19.983 --> 03:34:24.526]  And let's finish up, and we're also going to get to this Bernie $1,000 meme contest.
[03:34:24.566 --> 03:34:37.275]  We had one last week showing the image of Romney, Bush, who's laughing like a little piggly wiggly, and Rubio all on a plane together during Romney's campaign, failed campaign for president in 2012.
[03:34:39.276 --> 03:34:43.419]  And we had a meme contest for that, and the winner was a lady who just started listening to us.
[03:34:43.639 --> 03:34:45.781]  Her Twitter handle is Can't Stump the Trump.
[03:34:46.441 --> 03:34:48.282]  She just started listening to us about six months ago.
[03:34:48.623 --> 03:34:52.465]  Her late husband was a big fan of Alex, and so she just started listening to it.
[03:34:52.505 --> 03:34:52.966]  She's a mom.
[03:34:53.006 --> 03:34:53.926]  She's got five kids.
[03:34:54.246 --> 03:34:55.287]  Sounds like a really nice lady.
[03:34:55.307 --> 03:34:57.228]  I've been chatting her back and forth on Twitter.
[03:34:58.513 --> 03:35:01.415]  And, you know, she just decided to enter it and her meme won.
[03:35:01.435 --> 03:35:02.556]  She got $1,000.
[03:35:02.596 --> 03:35:04.057]  So you never know, you could be a winner.
[03:35:04.077 --> 03:35:06.519]  We're going to go over some of these and look at them in a second.
[03:35:07.079 --> 03:35:10.781]  You didn't have to stick to any particular picture, any particular video.
[03:35:10.801 --> 03:35:11.862]  It could be whatever you want.
[03:35:12.342 --> 03:35:17.026]  But a lot of people are pouring in about the white privilege thing that he kind of stuck his foot in his mouth on that.
[03:35:17.046 --> 03:35:21.088]  Did you see that video where he said white people don't know Paul and they're not Paul?
[03:35:21.529 --> 03:35:22.009]  Yeah.
[03:35:22.749 --> 03:35:23.130]  Amazing.
[03:35:23.590 --> 03:35:27.692]  Yeah, and of course we went downtown and there's lots of poor white people.
[03:35:27.772 --> 03:35:28.933]  There's poor white people everywhere.
[03:35:28.973 --> 03:35:32.674]  In fact, they outnumber everybody else in being poor.
[03:35:32.694 --> 03:35:37.397]  That's another good thing white people are really good at, being poor.
[03:35:37.677 --> 03:35:39.698]  Did we finish up with North Korea?
[03:35:40.738 --> 03:35:41.859]  Do you have anything else to add on that?
[03:35:43.339 --> 03:35:49.823]  Why isn't the mainstream media talking about the most imminent threat to our country?
[03:35:49.983 --> 03:35:57.006]  A little, short, fat guy in Korea who has nukes.
[03:35:57.987 --> 03:36:03.270]  One of which is probably passing over our country at 300 miles optimum altitude.
[03:36:03.350 --> 03:36:05.571]  They say it's tumbling right now.
[03:36:05.651 --> 03:36:06.411]  They say tumbling.
[03:36:07.712 --> 03:36:09.953]  Did you guys pull up the picture of him on his secret weapon?
[03:36:11.788 --> 03:36:12.829]  I see one of those.
[03:36:12.889 --> 03:36:13.749]  Click on any one of those.
[03:36:13.769 --> 03:36:14.810]  He's got a secret weapon.
[03:36:14.850 --> 03:36:15.890]  He's got a unicorn.
[03:36:15.950 --> 03:36:21.733]  He's charging in a... A unicorn and an Uzi with Dennis Rodman by his side.
[03:36:21.954 --> 03:36:24.155]  Dennis Rodman is incidentally a Trump supporter too.
[03:36:26.116 --> 03:36:26.976]  He sent out a tweet.
[03:36:26.996 --> 03:36:29.918]  They said something about him and he goes, you're all going to get fired just like I did.
[03:36:31.832 --> 03:36:33.233]  So that was very interesting.
[03:36:33.273 --> 03:36:34.373]  Hey, let's go to Austin now.
[03:36:34.393 --> 03:36:37.654]  Let's talk about Ted Cruz being a U.S.
[03:36:37.694 --> 03:36:38.095]  citizen.
[03:36:38.115 --> 03:36:40.256]  I don't know if they're ever going to settle that.
[03:36:40.356 --> 03:36:45.598]  I mean, do we even settle if Barry Sotero is and who his real daddy is?
[03:36:45.618 --> 03:36:47.118]  I don't even know if we're ever going to settle that.
[03:36:47.639 --> 03:36:48.999]  We never even saw the real birth certificate.
[03:36:49.019 --> 03:36:49.739]  But go ahead, Austin.
[03:36:49.759 --> 03:36:50.400]  What's on your mind?
[03:36:51.500 --> 03:36:57.903]  Well, actually, yeah, I was wanting to talk a little bit about that, but just I saw a video recently of him talking about
[03:36:58.559 --> 03:37:05.962]  The 14th Amendment, I guess it was supposedly, it was showing how he contradicts himself on this issue of natural born citizenship.
[03:37:05.982 --> 03:37:15.466]  And he said actually that he was for the 14th Amendment and just the fact that if you're born here, you're a citizen, even though your parents aren't from here, I guess.
[03:37:16.346 --> 03:37:20.728]  And then he said he supported it and he was upset at people for trying to change it.
[03:37:20.748 --> 03:37:22.869]  You know, he's talking about how he's a constitutionalist.
[03:37:23.009 --> 03:37:23.469]  And then it went
[03:37:24.324 --> 03:37:28.891]  To a more recent interview he had where he says, oh, yeah, we need to get rid of that.
[03:37:29.011 --> 03:37:30.493]  And then he says, in fact, back in 2011.
[03:37:32.046 --> 03:37:36.367]  I said the same thing, you know, so he's actually contradicting himself and lying on top of it.
[03:37:36.687 --> 03:37:41.888]  Well, I think his mom was a registered voter in Canada and they claim she was a U.S.
[03:37:41.928 --> 03:37:46.029]  citizen, but she was registered to vote in Canada, so I don't know what that makes you at that point.
[03:37:46.089 --> 03:37:47.710]  Definitely fudgy.
[03:37:48.590 --> 03:37:53.311]  If I was a country, you would have to be a citizen of that country to vote in that country.
[03:37:54.031 --> 03:37:57.572]  Although here, it's kind of whatever in some places.
[03:37:57.612 --> 03:38:00.953]  I think California, anybody can go in and vote as many times as they want.
[03:38:01.750 --> 03:38:05.091]  You kind of hit the head on it.
[03:38:05.131 --> 03:38:07.052]  His mom was voting in Canada.
[03:38:07.072 --> 03:38:14.215]  She's on the voter registration logs up there, which meant that she had established herself as a Canadian citizen.
[03:38:14.475 --> 03:38:23.139]  His dad was not an American citizen, so there's plenty of constitutional reason to question his citizenship.
[03:38:23.812 --> 03:38:28.035]  No, when I first heard Trump start talking about it, I thought, oh, this is kind of nonsense.
[03:38:28.075 --> 03:38:32.838]  But as I began to study it, much like our listener here, I came to the same conclusion.
[03:38:32.858 --> 03:38:34.139]  Hey, there's some substance here.
[03:38:35.200 --> 03:38:40.083]  He really may not be eligible to be president of this country.
[03:38:40.423 --> 03:38:45.907]  And that would be a coup d'etat if he got up to that point, he was nominated, and then they go, wait, you're ineligible.
[03:38:46.167 --> 03:38:47.008]  Hillary wins.
[03:38:47.708 --> 03:38:49.229]  You know, no debate necessary.
[03:38:49.910 --> 03:38:53.092]  And now that the Bushes have joined up with him, I don't know what that means.
[03:38:56.147 --> 03:39:01.513]  I know Cruz personally.
[03:39:01.593 --> 03:39:03.615]  I had dinner with him last year about this time.
[03:39:04.096 --> 03:39:11.904]  He was soliciting my support and I vetted him to find that he is the designated opponent
[03:39:12.484 --> 03:39:19.010]  He is an establishment through and through who is put up as if we have a choice.
[03:39:19.131 --> 03:39:20.812]  You know how that works.
[03:39:21.413 --> 03:39:22.314]  He's a neocon.
[03:39:22.634 --> 03:39:24.556]  He wants to send our kids to the Ukraine.
[03:39:24.596 --> 03:39:25.957]  He wants to send them to Syria.
[03:39:26.457 --> 03:39:28.079]  All to protect moneyed interest.
[03:39:28.139 --> 03:39:29.380]  We have no business being there.
[03:39:29.941 --> 03:39:32.603]  He actually said to me the last thing, he says, you know I'm not a neocon.
[03:39:33.484 --> 03:39:37.706]  Look, Eddie Mac, why do you want to send our kids to these places?
[03:39:38.086 --> 03:39:40.988]  I've already pointed out it's just for the moneyed interest.
[03:39:41.308 --> 03:39:45.350]  If you look at his advisors, two of them were former CIA directors.
[03:39:46.530 --> 03:39:50.152]  We now know that he borrowed money from Goldman Sachs and Citibank that he didn't report.
[03:39:51.052 --> 03:39:59.778]  This guy is as deep a state as anybody, and unfortunately the governor of Texas doesn't know that.
[03:40:00.239 --> 03:40:01.460]  Although I've talked to him about it.
[03:40:03.161 --> 03:40:16.470]  Trump has fooled, I mean Cruz has fooled a lot of people, but he is the designated opponent so that they can get either of their people into the backlash.
[03:40:16.710 --> 03:40:18.050]  I mean, at first I think it was Bush.
[03:40:18.290 --> 03:40:22.131]  They just assumed, the media assumed, we can name him heir apparent and everybody will agree with us.
[03:40:22.211 --> 03:40:23.932]  But then people started asking him questions.
[03:40:24.312 --> 03:40:24.492]  Yeah.
[03:40:24.712 --> 03:40:26.553]  And he just, he doesn't know anything.
[03:40:27.153 --> 03:40:28.453]  And then it went to Rubio.
[03:40:28.873 --> 03:40:32.554]  And then the incredible shrinking candidate just keeps getting smaller and smaller.
[03:40:32.954 --> 03:40:35.615]  And now, you know, Cruz is definitely, I think, third runner up.
[03:40:35.655 --> 03:40:39.596]  They had, that's why they put a ton of people in here to see who fans out, see who's going to work.
[03:40:40.416 --> 03:40:42.598]  And you know, Ben Carson, I don't think he was establishment.
[03:40:43.658 --> 03:40:45.179]  But he just couldn't get any traction.
[03:40:45.600 --> 03:40:46.700]  Fiorina, I don't know.
[03:40:47.501 --> 03:40:47.901]  She was.
[03:40:48.601 --> 03:40:50.062]  Rand Paul was the exception.
[03:40:50.383 --> 03:40:50.743]  I agree.
[03:40:51.303 --> 03:40:52.084]  And I know Rand Paul.
[03:40:52.204 --> 03:40:55.326]  I took him to Haiti back in November.
[03:40:55.346 --> 03:40:56.427]  I spent four days with him.
[03:40:56.827 --> 03:40:59.569]  He was doing eye surgeries on poor Haitians.
[03:41:00.089 --> 03:41:01.750]  So I had a lot of time to talk with him.
[03:41:03.531 --> 03:41:10.097]  I told him at the time, every evening we'd be in a hotel and I would say, look, Senator, you're the guy.
[03:41:10.137 --> 03:41:11.118]  You've got the voting record.
[03:41:11.279 --> 03:41:12.119]  And he could do it, too.
[03:41:12.440 --> 03:41:14.422]  But your campaign sucks.
[03:41:15.262 --> 03:41:18.605]  He has surrounded himself with people who aren't winners.
[03:41:19.346 --> 03:41:21.008]  I think that's the bottom line.
[03:41:21.028 --> 03:41:22.089]  Because he is a winner.
[03:41:22.169 --> 03:41:22.990]  I've met him personally.
[03:41:23.030 --> 03:41:27.875]  I went and I did an interview with him out in, not too far from here, over near the lake.
[03:41:28.696 --> 03:41:32.260]  He was having a campaign fundraiser for his dad and we interviewed him.
[03:41:32.320 --> 03:41:33.742]  And I, you know, stand-up guy.
[03:41:33.762 --> 03:41:36.024]  I said, do you have anything you don't want me to ask?
[03:41:36.064 --> 03:41:37.326]  He's like, no, you can ask me whatever you want.
[03:41:37.546 --> 03:41:41.570]  So I just fired question after question after question until I couldn't think of anything to ask him anymore.
[03:41:41.630 --> 03:41:44.433]  And he answered every question with just being calm.
[03:41:44.473 --> 03:41:47.356]  He didn't go, well, he was not trying to dance around the issues.
[03:41:47.396 --> 03:41:49.699]  He had his principles centered in his mind.
[03:41:50.119 --> 03:41:51.400]  And, you know, he didn't waver from them.
[03:41:51.861 --> 03:41:53.743]  So it is a shame he is not in.
[03:41:54.343 --> 03:41:56.425]  Let's go to Kevin in Florida wants to talk about white privilege.
[03:41:56.445 --> 03:41:57.587]  You got two white guys here.
[03:41:58.307 --> 03:41:59.569]  Tell us how we're privileged, please.
[03:42:01.189 --> 03:42:03.310]  Well, first of all, thank you, Rob, for taking my call.
[03:42:03.410 --> 03:42:30.025]  I'm a lifetime, lifelong conspiracy theorist, like you guys are, and I wanted to get in, yeah, the white privilege aspect of it and how, like, ridiculously nuts it is that the majority of people are buying into this, you know, that just because you're white, mostly white males, that you're inherently racist, that everything's been handed to you, when the majority of people that I know that have anything are hard workers,
[03:42:30.760 --> 03:42:31.841]  Nine to five guys.
[03:42:33.002 --> 03:42:35.725]  First to come in early, last to leave.
[03:42:37.006 --> 03:42:43.352]  My concern with this is that you have a lot of these ignorant idiots out there that believe this that are gonna
[03:42:44.392 --> 03:43:09.370]  It's gonna allow Hillary and Bernie supporters to steal this election because as you guys have pointed out numerous times correctly that I think Trump really it's it's him or busted if he loses there's not gonna be another free election after this I mean with the hardcore socialism that they're trying to bring in would just give everything and everybody's free stuff with this magical free money that's gonna float out of thin air because people are too
[03:43:10.558 --> 03:43:15.489]  Ignorant to realize it comes from hard-working taxpayers who, the majority of them are white.
[03:43:16.291 --> 03:43:18.115]  And I wanted to get you guys' thoughts on that.
[03:43:18.783 --> 03:43:20.744]  Well, I think you're spot on.
[03:43:21.324 --> 03:43:23.225]  Pretty much on everything you just said.
[03:43:24.045 --> 03:43:31.308]  And what I would add to that would be I don't think Bernie's going to steal any elections because they're stealing it from him.
[03:43:31.348 --> 03:43:40.311]  I think they're stealing the nomination from Bernie Sanders right now because if you look at the crowds that Bernie pulls in, they are huge compared to what Hillary pulls in.
[03:43:40.351 --> 03:43:41.652]  Hillary is establishment.
[03:43:41.692 --> 03:43:44.033]  She started off with a 500 delegate lead.
[03:43:44.693 --> 03:43:46.253]  You know, I've tweeted out a picture.
[03:43:46.273 --> 03:43:46.954]  They hadn't even
[03:43:47.854 --> 03:43:54.239]  She hasn't shown any poll results yet in a couple, I think it was the Saturday primaries, and she already had six delegates.
[03:43:54.499 --> 03:43:56.440]  And it was zero percent reporting.
[03:43:56.721 --> 03:43:57.942]  I mean, you can't beat that.
[03:43:57.962 --> 03:43:59.563]  That's just math you can't win against.
[03:43:59.943 --> 03:44:05.627]  And what I would like to see is the Bernie people that are anti-establishment in a lot of ways.
[03:44:05.667 --> 03:44:09.810]  I know a lot of them, there's probably 20 percent that think everything's going to be for free.
[03:44:10.451 --> 03:44:12.172]  And then there's another percentage.
[03:44:13.533 --> 03:44:18.777]  That are hardworking people that think the system is rigged and they're like, you know what, I'm going with Bernie because I like what he's saying.
[03:44:18.797 --> 03:44:22.780]  90% of the stuff, I don't think there's anybody out there that agrees with a candidate all the way.
[03:44:23.181 --> 03:44:29.826]  But I'd like to see those supporters come over and start supporting Donald Trump because I think you're going to see what happened to Rand Paul is what's going to happen to Bernie Sanders.
[03:44:29.846 --> 03:44:31.207]  They're just going to steal it right out from under him.
[03:44:31.627 --> 03:44:31.827]  Yeah.
[03:44:31.907 --> 03:44:37.431]  You know, Kevin, I left home at 16, put myself through college making $1.10 an hour.
[03:44:38.792 --> 03:44:41.713]  You may be old enough to remember minimum wage at that level.
[03:44:41.893 --> 03:44:42.794]  I don't think Rob does.
[03:44:43.074 --> 03:44:46.076]  I was at $4.25 an hour when I started.
[03:44:46.256 --> 03:44:47.857]  At McDonald's, by the way.
[03:44:49.478 --> 03:44:55.682]  I was a millionaire at 25 from working hard, then I was bankrupt at 30 from stupid mistakes, but then a billionaire at 50.
[03:44:56.163 --> 03:45:02.387]  So, I guarantee you there was no privilege involved, or luck for that matter.
[03:45:02.407 --> 03:45:05.049]  The harder I worked, the luckier I got, perhaps.
[03:45:05.816 --> 03:45:06.736]  Yeah, I would agree.
[03:45:07.056 --> 03:45:09.937]  And good luck happens when you're prepared and in the timing.
[03:45:10.157 --> 03:45:13.358]  You know, if you're prepared, something's going to come along and you're going to be like, hey, I'm ready for that.
[03:45:13.718 --> 03:45:14.098]  Boom.
[03:45:14.278 --> 03:45:14.638]  I'm in it.
[03:45:15.098 --> 03:45:15.838]  I'm in it to win it.
[03:45:16.579 --> 03:45:18.519]  Now we've got this Daily Mail article.
[03:45:18.899 --> 03:45:23.100]  Florida pastor who endorses Donald Trump is a Sandy Hook truth or Reverend Carl Gallup's claims.
[03:45:23.180 --> 03:45:27.281]  No one died in the Newtown shootings and grieving parents are Hollywood actors.
[03:45:28.261 --> 03:45:30.322]  And I guess he spoke at a Trump
[03:45:31.702 --> 03:45:32.623]  We're good to go.
[03:45:52.589 --> 03:46:01.156]  And he wrote an article called Sandy Hook Puzzles, and he talks about just the myriad of photographs that look like they were created for this event.
[03:46:01.876 --> 03:46:11.764]  And he goes through all the evidence, and I'm not going to really go through it here, but I encourage you to read that article, because it seems like they're taking anything they can to tie to Donald Trump.
[03:46:11.804 --> 03:46:20.431]  They had the guy who got arrested tied with the Bundy situation, and in Burns, Oregon, they arrested him and called him a Trump campaign head.
[03:46:20.991 --> 03:46:24.893]  You know, he just kept getting more promotions as bigger entities picked up on it.
[03:46:24.993 --> 03:46:27.535]  First, he was just, you know, a guy that worked on a Trump campaign.
[03:46:27.555 --> 03:46:29.136]  Then he became a Trump campaign head.
[03:46:29.556 --> 03:46:31.657]  Next, he's going to be running everything for Donald.
[03:46:31.897 --> 03:46:32.958]  And he got arrested.
[03:46:33.198 --> 03:46:35.860]  And he wasn't even there when the standoffs occurred.
[03:46:35.920 --> 03:46:36.960]  He arrived afterwards.
[03:46:37.020 --> 03:46:39.842]  So the media is grasping at straws.
[03:46:40.082 --> 03:46:40.923]  But I will say this.
[03:46:40.983 --> 03:46:43.464]  If you watch the video of Robbie Parker, one of the
[03:46:45.365 --> 03:46:57.013]  Parents of this Sandy Hook incident, there is video of this guy and he's laughing and I've been in plays, I've watched people get prepared for crying scenes.
[03:46:57.313 --> 03:46:58.774]  They did exactly what he did.
[03:46:58.914 --> 03:47:04.298]  They put their head down, they think about some memory that they bring back in their head that they've had loaded in there.
[03:47:04.318 --> 03:47:10.903]  They pre-loaded this while they're rehearsing so that they can go to it right before they go on stage and it was an Our Town play.
[03:47:11.203 --> 03:47:13.304]  When everybody died, the girl dies at the end.
[03:47:13.764 --> 03:47:19.767]  I watched her mother in the play bend down, take some deep breaths, and boom, the tears were flowing.
[03:47:20.107 --> 03:47:21.588]  And he did that exact same thing.
[03:47:22.108 --> 03:47:27.810]  In my professional opinion, I have a theater degree and I've directed several plays, movies, and there it is right there.
[03:47:27.870 --> 03:47:28.831]  You can see him smiling.
[03:47:29.051 --> 03:47:31.252]  I mean, to me that's not a guy who just lost
[03:47:32.813 --> 03:47:33.113]  I don't know.
[03:47:33.133 --> 03:47:33.954]  That's Robbie Parker.
[03:47:33.994 --> 03:47:35.314]  He's one of the parents.
[03:47:35.354 --> 03:47:39.075]  So there you can see now he's gone into character and now he's ready.
[03:47:39.095 --> 03:47:40.275]  He's about to start talking.
[03:47:40.876 --> 03:47:44.637]  So to me that smells, stinks to high heaven.
[03:47:44.657 --> 03:47:50.999]  We've seen other events that we know are manufactured like Boston bombing survivor killed in Dubai car crash.
[03:47:51.319 --> 03:47:54.680]  And if you look at the pictures of this girl here, she's being carried.
[03:47:56.291 --> 03:47:56.992]  We'll show you this picture.
[03:47:57.012 --> 03:47:58.854]  She's being carried, and this is supposedly a tourniquet.
[03:47:58.874 --> 03:48:02.017]  Does that look like a knot that's wrapped up to be a tourniquet?
[03:48:02.057 --> 03:48:03.779]  Looks like somebody just tied a sash around.
[03:48:03.819 --> 03:48:05.101]  Hey, you're ready to go.
[03:48:05.161 --> 03:48:05.581]  Get in there.
[03:48:05.621 --> 03:48:06.222]  Get in the game.
[03:48:06.662 --> 03:48:08.544]  Well, now she's died in a car crash in Dubai.
[03:48:09.365 --> 03:48:11.688]  We'll see her in our next feature.
[03:48:11.808 --> 03:48:12.509]  Maybe so.
[03:48:12.529 --> 03:48:13.430]  Yeah, you never know.
[03:48:13.610 --> 03:48:15.812]  Maybe she was supposed to be a car crash victim.
[03:48:16.633 --> 03:48:18.735]  You know, it's just interesting how they do all this.
[03:48:19.015 --> 03:48:23.398]  Going back to your movie, Pentagon admits using its military drones to spy on Americans.
[03:48:23.598 --> 03:48:28.702]  You actually, I don't know if you want to spoil it, but you have some drone situations in your movie, right?
[03:48:29.243 --> 03:48:32.826]  You know, if the average American doesn't realize that
[03:48:35.528 --> 03:48:36.468]  They're accessed.
[03:48:37.529 --> 03:48:39.831]  I'll give you kind of a side example.
[03:48:40.091 --> 03:48:55.603]  If you look on certain brands of TVs and you look at the disclaimer, you are acknowledging that a camera in the TV can observe you and listen to you, in your bedroom by the way, by purchasing this television.
[03:48:55.623 --> 03:48:56.844]  There's a camera right here.
[03:48:56.864 --> 03:48:57.985]  It's got one on each side.
[03:48:58.045 --> 03:48:59.647]  It doesn't matter where you put it, there's a camera.
[03:49:01.007 --> 03:49:04.349]  So, you know, we're just, we don't want to accept this.
[03:49:04.409 --> 03:49:08.371]  It's so far out of what we would believe our government would do.
[03:49:10.012 --> 03:49:11.252]  But that's the world we live in.
[03:49:11.412 --> 03:49:19.016]  Yeah, my movie has a scene, I'm at my ranch and we have been attacked by the EMP and all the electronics are...
[03:49:19.836 --> 03:49:21.037]  Or are shut down.
[03:49:21.077 --> 03:49:23.179]  Of course the government has their electronic devices.
[03:49:23.199 --> 03:49:24.621]  They have Faraday cages everywhere.
[03:49:25.402 --> 03:49:27.464]  Built by us, our taxpayer dollars.
[03:49:27.784 --> 03:49:33.990]  So I'll look up in the sky and I'm on the phone and I'll say, hey look, the government sent a nice drone over today.
[03:49:34.030 --> 03:49:36.432]  Well now they say it's only been 20 times since 2006 and 2015.
[03:49:38.294 --> 03:49:38.614]  Yeah.
[03:49:38.674 --> 03:49:46.639]  What you're going to see in 10 years, they're going to show that part 20 times and then they're going to go, but since 2016, it's gone up to 600 times.
[03:49:46.859 --> 03:49:47.039]  Yeah.
[03:49:47.199 --> 03:49:49.740]  You know, but they're doing it to keep us safe.
[03:49:50.060 --> 03:49:51.321]  So that's all we have to worry about.
[03:49:51.361 --> 03:49:52.562]  They're doing it to keep us safe.
[03:49:52.882 --> 03:49:57.704]  Let's go to Wayne in Kansas wants to talk shooting with the illegal immigration story.
[03:49:58.065 --> 03:50:00.226]  Is this something new that happened or an older story?
[03:50:01.497 --> 03:50:03.058]  No, actually, there's something new that happened.
[03:50:03.078 --> 03:50:04.199]  Thanks for having me on, Rob.
[03:50:04.259 --> 03:50:06.320]  I'm a long-time listener and supporter of the show.
[03:50:07.040 --> 03:50:10.863]  Over the last couple of days, we've had a developing story happen.
[03:50:11.223 --> 03:50:20.608]  Here in Kansas City, Kansas, we had a man gunned down four people, two of which were fathers and had kids of their own, and then ran to Missouri.
[03:50:21.209 --> 03:50:29.934]  They were finally captured, I believe, late last night, 175 miles away from where the crime in KCK took place.
[03:50:30.820 --> 03:50:34.662]  And he had killed someone else before they caught him in Missouri.
[03:50:35.182 --> 03:50:42.465]  This guy's name is Pablo Serrano, and he was here illegally in the United States.
[03:50:42.952 --> 03:50:47.893]  He had been captured in 2004 and deported and then sometime later came back in.
[03:50:48.434 --> 03:51:03.898]  And the funny thing about the story is, well it isn't funny, but the thing about the story is, is the guy had just been arrested, I guess, recently and charged with some criminal charges, but then released instead of being handed over to authorities.
[03:51:04.358 --> 03:51:06.681]  Because the government doesn't want to do its job deporting people.
[03:51:06.701 --> 03:51:08.683]  Stay right there, I'll have you back in at the last segment.
[03:51:08.703 --> 03:51:10.185]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[03:51:10.265 --> 03:51:11.827]  My name is Don Whiskin.
[03:51:11.987 --> 03:51:15.932]  In 1994, I lost my 62-year-old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[03:51:16.633 --> 03:51:20.437]  In 1977, my 44-year-old brother was found dead in his apartment.
[03:51:20.657 --> 03:51:21.719]  He suffered a heart attack.
[03:51:22.199 --> 03:51:25.621]  In January of 98, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed.
[03:51:26.082 --> 03:51:30.565]  21 days later, my 53-year-old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital.
[03:51:30.845 --> 03:51:31.725]  He waited too long.
[03:51:32.146 --> 03:51:35.168]  In June, that same year, I almost joined them at 42.
[03:51:35.488 --> 03:51:36.148]  What did I do?
[03:51:36.389 --> 03:51:43.653]  I took a 7-herb formula I now call ExtendoVite made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginkgo biloba, hawthorn, milk thistle, and valerian.
[03:51:43.833 --> 03:51:46.035]  Based on German studies of natural medicine,

[03:53:16.882 --> 03:53:20.064]  It rings once, twice, and then... Hello, it's GCN.
[03:53:20.225 --> 03:53:21.826]  What's your name and the state you're calling from?
[03:53:21.886 --> 03:53:25.248]  Surprised you got through, you squeak out... Jason from Minnesota.
[03:53:25.328 --> 03:53:25.809]  Please hold.
[03:53:25.949 --> 03:53:32.854]  As you patiently wait for your turn, you begin to daydream about being a famous talk radio host and what it would be like to have your own show.
[03:53:33.234 --> 03:53:34.916]  Jason from Minnesota, you're up!
[03:53:34.996 --> 03:53:38.882]  Millions of loyal listeners worldwide, waiting to call and talk to you.
[03:53:38.902 --> 03:53:39.903]  What color are you there?
[03:53:40.044 --> 03:53:42.567]  Cheering crowds surround you, calling out your name.
[03:53:42.787 --> 03:53:43.608]  Jason!
[03:53:43.949 --> 03:53:44.810]  Jason!
[03:53:45.231 --> 03:53:46.092]  Going once.
[03:53:46.392 --> 03:53:46.953]  Twice.
[03:53:47.053 --> 03:53:48.856]  Okay, we gotta move on to the next caller.
[03:53:49.036 --> 03:53:49.917]  You blew it.
[03:53:52.708 --> 03:53:53.268]  We're good to go.
[03:54:23.075 --> 03:54:31.437]  It was Sheriff Paul Babu, guess how you say his name, down in Arizona who said, President Obama's got us in a stranglehold here at the border.
[03:54:31.557 --> 03:54:33.697]  We can't do our job.
[03:54:34.258 --> 03:54:41.879]  Border Patrol agents are being put in low areas of where people are migrating across, are illegally invading.
[03:54:41.899 --> 03:54:44.040]  Let's be politically incorrect here.
[03:54:44.120 --> 03:54:45.120]  They're illegally invading.
[03:54:46.563 --> 03:54:47.984]  Um, entering illegally.
[03:54:48.885 --> 03:54:50.947]  And among other things, it's on Drudge Report.
[03:54:51.227 --> 03:54:55.351]  But here we have Serrano Vitorino is in the country illegally.
[03:54:55.471 --> 03:54:55.651]  U.S.
[03:54:55.691 --> 03:55:04.238]  Immigration and our ICE officials said in a statement he was deported in April 2004 and illegally re-entered the country on an unknown date.
[03:55:04.378 --> 03:55:06.680]  ICE said it would place a detainer on him.
[03:55:06.700 --> 03:55:11.765]  Hopefully, I think if you get back in, you gotta go four more countries down.
[03:55:13.197 --> 03:55:16.203]  We're making somebody else's problem, but that's just me.
[03:55:17.385 --> 03:55:21.652]  I'm sure he was here for good intentions, you know, murdering four people in cold blood.
[03:55:21.893 --> 03:55:23.756]  They're charging him a first-degree murder.
[03:55:24.733 --> 03:55:35.501]  So, you know Obama has a history now of releasing these people after their convictions, so I don't know that there's going to be justice here at all.
[03:55:35.741 --> 03:55:41.045]  I think we had a video out called the biggest prison, Obama leads biggest prison break in history.
[03:55:41.085 --> 03:55:42.026]  See if y'all can find that.
[03:55:42.086 --> 03:55:43.907]  It was probably last year sometime.
[03:55:44.708 --> 03:55:48.991]  And now they're saying the border is just as bad as last year, getting worse this year.
[03:55:49.691 --> 03:55:58.496]  So it's not ending, and I was having a debate, a lively debate, last night in a bar with a couple of individuals who I believe are Bernie supporters.
[03:56:00.177 --> 03:56:02.439]  And, you know, why does Trump want to build a wall?
[03:56:02.479 --> 03:56:03.840]  Well, this is why.
[03:56:03.860 --> 03:56:05.020]  This is why.
[03:56:05.060 --> 03:56:08.362]  We have people come into this country and they don't respect our laws.
[03:56:08.703 --> 03:56:15.527]  There's the video, Obama leads worst prison break in history, and it's about how he released a bunch of felons who were illegal aliens.
[03:56:16.107 --> 03:56:19.669]  And it was about, I don't remember the number, about a hundred thousand.
[03:56:19.709 --> 03:56:20.029]  Yeah.
[03:56:20.069 --> 03:56:20.950]  It was a big number.
[03:56:22.071 --> 03:56:22.951]  These aren't nice people.
[03:56:23.731 --> 03:56:24.612]  They're just not.
[03:56:25.292 --> 03:56:26.433]  I mean, we got to do something.
[03:56:26.693 --> 03:56:29.695]  You can't just sit around and go, well, that's racist to say that.
[03:56:29.795 --> 03:56:33.317]  It's not racist to say we don't want people who kill people in our country.
[03:56:33.397 --> 03:56:34.698]  We would like less of those people.
[03:56:35.922 --> 03:56:37.463]  Of course they're flying him in.
[03:56:37.863 --> 03:56:43.827]  Oh yeah, letting him fly without, I was about to say TPS reports, without TSA credentials or whatever.
[03:56:43.887 --> 03:56:45.388]  The TSA doesn't check him, it's okay.
[03:56:45.808 --> 03:56:53.893]  You know, but if we go to South Padre Island, it's not even going into Mexico and try to drive back, we have to get our butts sniffed by the TSA and the Border Patrol.
[03:56:54.013 --> 03:56:57.215]  Speaking of that, I'll be at South Padre Island next week for Spring Break.
[03:56:57.875 --> 03:57:02.260]  Oh wow, it's got a lot of traffic down there during spring break.
[03:57:02.901 --> 03:57:03.842]  On the north part of the island?
[03:57:04.462 --> 03:57:05.844]  Yeah, where the movie theater is.
[03:57:09.266 --> 03:57:10.687]  My final point is, you know,
[03:57:31.587 --> 03:57:36.329]  Stories like this justify exactly what Donald Trump has been talking about with our border.
[03:57:36.349 --> 03:57:42.651]  You know, here you have five people that lost their lives, that if our border was secure, would still be alive right now.
[03:57:43.031 --> 03:57:56.476]  And if you go to the different pages here for our local media that's telling the story, and people are talking about this, people are going out and commenting and attacking people, calling them racist, just because they want a secure border.
[03:57:56.636 --> 03:57:58.298]  Yeah, yeah, that's it.
[03:57:58.938 --> 03:58:04.103]  Racist, racist, and that's, you know, it's what they hear, it's what they've been programmed to say.
[03:58:04.203 --> 03:58:08.928]  If you speak out against murderers coming into our country illegally and murdering people, you're a racist.
[03:58:10.329 --> 03:58:10.770]  You know what?
[03:58:10.830 --> 03:58:11.510]  That's the music.
[03:58:11.551 --> 03:58:14.113]  I'm not going to have time to get to our last three callers.
[03:58:14.133 --> 03:58:16.275]  Sorry to Jerome, John, and Michael.
[03:58:17.416 --> 03:58:18.498]  Gary Haven, thanks for joining us.
[03:58:18.538 --> 03:58:19.780]  Hope your movie's a big success.
[03:58:20.341 --> 03:58:20.801]  Thank you, Rob.
[03:58:20.841 --> 03:58:21.422]  Glad to be here.
[03:58:21.462 --> 03:58:24.928]  Not just because Alex is in it, but because it sounds like a great movie.
[03:58:24.968 --> 03:58:29.494]  I mean, I love stories like this where, you know, the government is not the good guy.
[03:58:29.535 --> 03:58:31.297]  Because the government is not the good guy.
[03:58:31.497 --> 03:58:32.839]  There's a lot of good people in government.
[03:58:33.500 --> 03:58:38.383]  But how big it's gotten, the bad people have taken over and they've compartmentalized.
[03:58:38.643 --> 03:58:40.984]  Join us tonight for live debate coverage 7 p.m.
[03:58:41.004 --> 03:58:41.304]  Central.
[03:58:41.324 --> 03:58:43.866]  It's gonna be live and I'm sitting in the main chair, so be there.

[03:58:58.649 --> 03:59:02.974]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[03:59:03.294 --> 03:59:07.899]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[03:59:08.060 --> 03:59:09.081]  Talk about the effects.
[03:59:09.381 --> 03:59:10.863]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[03:59:10.883 --> 03:59:12.505]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[03:59:12.825 --> 03:59:13.886]  I feel like I look better.
[03:59:13.946 --> 03:59:14.587]  I feel better.
[03:59:14.647 --> 03:59:15.728]  I feel sexier.
[03:59:16.049 --> 03:59:16.429]  I love it.
