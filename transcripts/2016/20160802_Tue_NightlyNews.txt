[00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:22.043]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.103 --> 00:00:25.705]  It is Tuesday, August 2nd, 2016 and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:27.065]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:27.546 --> 00:00:28.046]  Tonight...
[00:00:33.223 --> 00:00:52.970]  The President, whose administration gave guns to cartels, grenades to terrorists, killed civilians in foreign airstrikes, left Libya to rot after its liberation, re-signed the Patriot Act, gave us the NDAA, persecuted journalists and whistleblowers, lied about giving away housing,
[00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.692]  Yes, I think the Republican nominee is unfit to serve as president.
[00:00:55.712 --> 00:00:58.474]  I said so last week and he keeps on proving it.
[00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:32.206]  We have ended the big MAGA sale.
[00:01:32.646 --> 00:01:35.770]  Now, we have kept three items, though, this week.
[00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.235]  That's Rainforce Wall Supplies Last, the amazing new tropic, for $17.76, normally $29.
[00:01:41.656 --> 00:01:43.978]  Leading competitors that have similar formulas are $60 to $70 to $80.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.481]  That's 40% off.
[00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:48.522]  DNA Force, our flagship product.
[00:01:48.562 --> 00:01:50.483]  It's a big deal to offer 30% off on that.
[00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:51.664]  We're extending that.
[00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:53.566]  And then Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:56.408]  All the vitamins, all the minerals, the amino acids, the cofactors.
[00:01:56.948 --> 00:01:57.669]  Help upload it.
[00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:58.929]  Great tasting fruit punch.
[00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.310]  Info Wars.
[00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:01.511]  Life.com.
[00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:02.512]  That's 30% off.
[00:02:02.752 --> 00:02:03.573]  But I'm gonna go further.
[00:02:04.153 --> 00:02:04.453]  Boom!
[00:02:04.493 --> 00:02:04.954]  Here it is.
[00:02:04.994 --> 00:02:07.435]  Normally you sign up for auto-shipping at 10% off.
[00:02:07.516 --> 00:02:08.696]  You still get that on top of it.
[00:02:09.037 --> 00:02:10.077]  I'm doing free shipping on everything.
[00:02:10.498 --> 00:02:21.926]  Whether it's one Hillary for Prison shirt, or a Bill Clinton rape shirt, or whatever it is, whatever informational warfare weapon you want to help spread the word and meet like-minded people, free shipping store-wide.
[00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:23.567]  Free shipping store-wide.
[00:02:24.128 --> 00:02:28.711]  So I want to thank you all for your support, your prayers, and so much more.
[00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:06.948]  President Obama held a joint press conference today with the Prime Minister of Singapore.
[00:03:07.068 --> 00:03:10.794]  There he talked all about the importance of passing the TPP.
[00:03:11.174 --> 00:03:17.163]  Now you'll notice that any mention of the TPP was noticeably absent from his speech there at the DNC.
[00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:23.249]  But of course Obama couldn't pass up the opportunity to take some jabs at Trump.
[00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:32.036]  Now this time he specifically called out the presidential nominee saying that he was woefully unprepared for the presidency.
[00:03:32.456 --> 00:03:36.060]  He says there's got to be a point where Republicans say that enough is enough.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:44.387]  Obama said Trump doesn't have the judgment, temperament or understanding to occupy the Oval Office and he scolded Trump for his attack
[00:03:44.887 --> 00:03:46.288]  On a gold star family.
[00:03:46.608 --> 00:03:55.376]  So, of course, you know, this is the same president whose best judgment sees him playing a round of golf after every single ISIS beheading or terrorist attack.
[00:03:55.756 --> 00:04:08.547]  But, you know, Donald Trump, he doesn't have what it takes because only Obama can go on Saturday, Saturday Night Live and all these other reality type shows, you know, and with his great judgment there, he's so fitting to be the president.
[00:04:09.247 --> 00:04:19.589]  So, he also went on to implore Republicans to un-endorse Donald Trump, and asking, you know, what does it say about the Republican Party that Trump is their standard bearer?
[00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:28.851]  So, here he goes, trying to, of course, interfere with this election, really hammering down that he doesn't like Trump, Trump is unfit, we gotta back Hillary.
[00:04:29.431 --> 00:04:37.313]  Hopefully this will have the opposite effect, just like his doomed appeal to Brits when he tried to interfere with the Brexit vote.
[00:04:37.813 --> 00:04:40.354]  But Kit Daniels has an interesting take on this.
[00:04:40.674 --> 00:04:45.915]  He says Obama coming out like this really actually signals that Trump could win this election.
[00:04:46.256 --> 00:04:54.138]  He said if the election was already, in fact, in the bag for Hillary Clinton, Obama wouldn't be working overtime to convince the GOP to dump Trump.
[00:04:54.518 --> 00:05:00.160]  Instead, he'd be encouraging Trump to continue speaking out more if his words were actually helping Hillary.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.280]  That's not the case.
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.881]  He's signaling that the globalists are losing.
[00:05:04.201 --> 00:05:09.544]  And Hillary is falling too far behind for the technocrats to rig the election in her favor.
[00:05:10.184 --> 00:05:14.347]  He also points out how Trump has pulled the curtain to expose the globalists.
[00:05:14.707 --> 00:05:16.128]  He's exposed how evil they are.
[00:05:16.388 --> 00:05:19.089]  They're not the saviors of humanity as they portray themselves to be.
[00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:28.635]  So this is basically the Wizard of Oz panicking with the president rolling out like this and using these joint press conferences to push back against Donald Trump.
[00:05:29.235 --> 00:05:46.503]  And it's also very revealing that he made this desperate declaration right after Trump warned that the general election is rigged, and that he has a fear that it could be rigged, just like the Democratic nomination was rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton, despite the fact that the majority of Democratic voters wanted Bernie Sanders.
[00:05:47.083 --> 00:05:55.953]  Now Alex Jones warned just a few days ago about the rigging of the election and of course now the Republican nominee Donald Trump has come out echoing that warning.
[00:05:56.654 --> 00:06:08.446]  Trump said that he was only able to secure the Republican nomination because he won in a massive landslide, suggesting that the same margin of victory must be necessary to overturn Hillary's dirty tricks in the general election.
[00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:15.652]  And he also repeated on Sean Hannity's news show that, you know, he'd been hearing it for a long time.
[00:06:16.012 --> 00:06:23.477]  He knew that last time there were precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the Republican, a lot of people were curious, how is that even possible?
[00:06:23.918 --> 00:06:30.983]  And so Alex Jones, in his warning, said, if she stole the primary, she's going to try to steal the general election.
[00:06:31.323 --> 00:06:38.148]  We need a referendum supporting free and open elections in this country, and that referendum is a landslide for Trump.
[00:06:38.488 --> 00:06:41.370]  We've got to call this fraud out for what she is.
[00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.693]  And that's exactly what we're going to need to see, is a landslide, because that's the only way they're not going to be able to rig the election, of course.
[00:06:47.114 --> 00:06:53.038]  Hillary and her campaign have come out immediately calling Trump a pathetic, dangerous conspiracy theorist.
[00:06:53.638 --> 00:06:56.298]  So this is Hillary Clinton's press secretary, Brian Fallon.
[00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:03.440]  He's been sending out a spree of tweets there, calling Trump's comments pathetic, a reflexive conspiracy theorist.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:13.902]  He responded to Trump's assertion that the general election debates are being rigged by the Democrats because they're airing on the same night and time as the NFL football games.
[00:07:14.362 --> 00:07:18.102]  Of course, that means nobody is really going to be watching or they're going to have to really choose.
[00:07:18.502 --> 00:07:21.943]  You know, most people gather their friends around to watch the NFL games.
[00:07:22.663 --> 00:07:27.628]  And you'll recall, this was the exact same setup the Democrats wanted for the Democratic debates.
[00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:30.331]  Because most people know Hillary Clinton's name.
[00:07:30.752 --> 00:07:34.075]  You don't even have to really know her politics, but you know her name.
[00:07:34.395 --> 00:07:37.639]  So they didn't want any of her opponents to get any airtime.
[00:07:37.899 --> 00:07:40.462]  So they set the debates up on major nights when most people
[00:07:40.762 --> 00:07:41.883]  Really aren't going to tune in.
[00:07:42.263 --> 00:07:58.672]  So of course they're being rigged in there because the media controls the narrative heavily and most people, if they're watching the football game the next day, they're going to tune in and just get the highlights, which I guarantee are going to read something like, Hillary Clinton literally destroyed Donald Trump.
[00:07:59.452 --> 00:08:02.533]  And so that's just what they're going to go ahead and believe, is that she won.
[00:08:02.573 --> 00:08:13.718]  They will look at the highlights, which will of course be them cutting out certain aspects of the debates that they would like to portray and, you know, photoshop Donald Trump with really tiny, tiny hands.
[00:08:15.424 --> 00:08:26.512]  Now you'll recall that just a week ago, it was the left, the left media, who was putting out the conspiracy theory that the Russians would try and hack the elections.
[00:08:26.832 --> 00:08:32.816]  That's right, they were saying, without a doubt, the Russians hacked into the DNC servers, so that means Russia
[00:08:33.877 --> 00:08:34.157]  I think so.
[00:08:51.415 --> 00:08:56.941]  On their phone of the voting process and you're watching their votes being switched in real time.
[00:08:57.381 --> 00:09:02.106]  But of course, so long as they're rigged in favor of the establishment, they're never going to push back.
[00:09:02.406 --> 00:09:10.775]  But here they're actually saying, you know, they're kind of setting it up to where something could, they could have a recall or something and they can just blame it on the Russians.
[00:09:11.155 --> 00:09:15.457]  So, but when Donald Trump says it, he is a crazy reflexive conspiracy theorist.
[00:09:15.837 --> 00:09:19.799]  But there's another way that we can actually see some rigging of the system.
[00:09:20.139 --> 00:09:28.102]  We have politicians in some states actively restricting the crowd sizes for people who can go and show up to Trump rallies.
[00:09:28.543 --> 00:09:31.904]  This is the Columbus, Ohio, Mayor Andrew Ginther.
[00:09:32.184 --> 00:09:35.586]  Now, just 24 hours ago, he campaigned with Hillary Clinton.
[00:09:35.946 --> 00:09:38.347]  During her visit to the city, he even got a shout out in her
[00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:39.088]  I think so.
[00:09:54.525 --> 00:09:58.047]  And so today he seemingly delivered for Clinton.
[00:09:58.307 --> 00:10:06.291]  He restricted the capacity of Donald Trump's crowd size, leaving a lot more people outside unable to get to get into the convention center.
[00:10:07.052 --> 00:10:08.452]  Donald Trump kind of pointed this out.
[00:10:08.512 --> 00:10:12.374]  He kind of was joking, saying, you know, maybe they're up there, maybe they're a Hillary person.
[00:10:12.454 --> 00:10:12.895]  I don't know.
[00:10:12.955 --> 00:10:15.956]  And of course, seems like he was obviously right about that.
[00:10:16.336 --> 00:10:17.157]  The fire marshal
[00:10:17.757 --> 00:10:18.057]  I think so.
[00:10:38.849 --> 00:10:40.370]  That this is what the Democrats are doing.
[00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:46.855]  They're not actually allowing you to look at Hillary Clinton's record or any of the stories about Hillary Clinton.
[00:10:46.935 --> 00:10:52.439]  It's all about setting Donald Trump up to where he has to constantly push back against all of their attacks.
[00:10:52.859 --> 00:10:55.581]  No one has any time to dig into the dirt on Hillary Clinton.
[00:10:55.941 --> 00:10:56.842]  It's a total setup.
[00:10:57.282 --> 00:10:58.903]  But Trump is absolutely right.
[00:10:59.063 --> 00:11:03.667]  Hillary Clinton stole the nomination and she will try to steal the presidency.
[00:11:04.744 --> 00:11:09.326]  This is according to both the DNC email leak and the entire primary process.
[00:11:09.406 --> 00:11:18.671]  It proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Democratic Party establishment has nothing but contempt for the democratic will of the people and it will not hesitate to rig the vote.
[00:11:19.091 --> 00:11:29.116]  The New York Daily News reported that the Democratic Party nomination is largely controlled by the desire of party bosses who don't have to take into account the expressed desire of Democratic voters.
[00:11:29.676 --> 00:11:37.758]  When asked, superdelegates in New York State said they would still support Hillary Clinton, even if Bernie Sanders had won the Empire State's primary.
[00:11:38.098 --> 00:11:42.659]  So, I mean, that just goes to show you, Bernie Sanders voters, your votes did not matter to them.
[00:11:42.699 --> 00:11:44.780]  They had already picked Hillary Clinton.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:45.740]  It did not matter.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.301]  And as the DNC emails illustrate,
[00:11:49.201 --> 00:11:54.003]  The establishment had pre-selected Hillary Clinton from the very start of the primary process.
[00:11:54.364 --> 00:11:59.786]  They chose her before any of the primary votes came in, and they vowed to select her regardless of the result.
[00:12:00.066 --> 00:12:02.887]  How in any way is this not a rigged process?
[00:12:03.428 --> 00:12:08.650]  So Trump's warning that Hillary Clinton is going to put out all the stops to do the same thing in the general election?
[00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:13.072]  It's not a conspiracy theory, it's the most likely scenario.
[00:12:15.865 --> 00:12:19.027]  You said in a speech today you're afraid this election is going to be rigged.
[00:12:19.367 --> 00:12:24.050]  I've been hearing about it for a long time and I hope the Republicans get out there and watch very closely.
[00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.732]  This new poll is showing a big convention balance for Hillary Clinton.
[00:12:26.832 --> 00:12:30.855]  Following her nomination at the Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton now leads it.
[00:12:31.175 --> 00:12:33.356]  Donald Trump, 50% to 42%.
[00:12:33.756 --> 00:12:35.898]  That's a 7 point jump from last week.
[00:12:36.018 --> 00:12:38.459]  You see, he's supposed to just sit there and let them steal it.
[00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:40.501]  But he didn't sit there, so they failed.
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:48.876]  And they think they're going to have another stolen general election in front of everybody at high noon and we're just going to sit here and go along with it.
[00:12:49.036 --> 00:12:49.377]  We're not.
[00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.130]  I'm gonna fight it.
[00:12:51.391 --> 00:12:52.231]  Trump's gonna fight it.
[00:12:52.491 --> 00:12:53.171]  You're gonna fight it.
[00:12:53.351 --> 00:12:55.292]  Bob Mulholland from Chico, California.
[00:12:55.352 --> 00:12:58.614]  I'm a DNC member, thus a superdelegate to the National Convention.
[00:12:58.894 --> 00:12:59.655]  First of all, it's rigged.
[00:13:00.235 --> 00:13:02.716]  And I'm afraid the election's gonna be rigged, I have to be honest.
[00:13:03.376 --> 00:13:08.239]  And the way we work is that anybody who gets 15% more in an election gets delegates.
[00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:10.380]  So this election will go all the way to California.
[00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.462]  Sanders will end up with well over a thousand delegates and Hillary will get the nomination.
[00:13:14.702 --> 00:13:23.386]  Hillary Clinton has had every advantage, every break given to her from the very beginning by this Democratic Party.
[00:13:23.506 --> 00:13:24.447]  It has been rigged.
[00:13:24.587 --> 00:13:36.313]  It is clearly the case that when given truth serum, Debbie Wasserman Schultz vastly prefers Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, obviously, and to the extent there are things that can be done institutionally and marginally to
[00:13:37.153 --> 00:13:47.241]  If Hillary steals the nomination, and then she openly is engaged in chicanery and things don't add up with Trump, you have to say it must be thrown out.
[00:13:47.601 --> 00:13:52.985]  The political parties choose their nominee, not the general public, contrary to popular belief.
[00:13:53.285 --> 00:13:54.766]  Then why are they holding the primaries?
[00:13:55.771 --> 00:13:56.852]  That's a very good question.
[00:13:57.012 --> 00:14:00.876]  WikiLeaks has dumped nearly 20,000 hacked emails from the DNC.
[00:14:00.916 --> 00:14:08.103]  We're talking about the report of leaked DNC emails showing an effort to undermine Bernie Sanders during the primaries.
[00:14:08.443 --> 00:14:12.788]  The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.
[00:14:13.508 --> 00:14:18.472]  When did the press see it as their role to protect the prerogative of the powerful?
[00:14:18.532 --> 00:14:19.533]  Actually, I think that's part of it.
[00:14:19.773 --> 00:14:23.476]  And we're not going to recognize Queen Hillary if there's evidence of fraud.
[00:14:23.777 --> 00:14:24.677]  And guess what there is?
[00:14:24.918 --> 00:14:26.819]  She stole the nomination.
[00:14:27.119 --> 00:14:29.842]  I want to thank Bernie Sanders.
[00:14:30.842 --> 00:14:35.706]  If he would have just not done anything, just go home, go to sleep, relax, he would have been a hero.
[00:14:35.846 --> 00:14:37.608]  But he made a deal with the devil.
[00:14:37.668 --> 00:14:38.108]  She's the devil.
[00:14:38.148 --> 00:14:39.690]  He made a deal with the devil.
[00:14:41.058 --> 00:14:47.021]  The media has created the perception that the voters will decide the nomination and that's the concept, that's the conflict here.
[00:14:47.041 --> 00:14:49.002]  We feel like we live in a democratic society.
[00:14:49.042 --> 00:14:54.324]  What you're telling me is it's not a democratic society and your votes don't necessarily matter because it's a democratic representation.
[00:14:54.424 --> 00:14:56.685]  Crooked Hillary thinks they're gonna pull what they did on Mitt Romney?
[00:14:57.045 --> 00:14:58.826]  Mm, lady, isn't gonna happen.
[00:14:59.026 --> 00:15:04.148]  That's why her campaign head, her chief strategist said, this is dangerous what Trump's doing.
[00:15:04.528 --> 00:15:05.949]  You're right, it is dangerous, isn't it?
[00:15:06.589 --> 00:15:07.890]  Actually standing up to you.
[00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.611]  I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president.
[00:15:10.771 --> 00:15:14.815]  And I'm telling you, November 8th, we better be careful, because that election's gonna be rigged.
[00:15:15.015 --> 00:15:15.275]  Yes.
[00:15:15.956 --> 00:15:20.039]  I think the Republican nominee is unfit to serve as president.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.263]  And I hope the Republicans are watching closely, or it's gonna be taken away from us.
[00:15:24.403 --> 00:15:33.051]  You're gonna be hearing a lot more about this, ladies and gentlemen, because Donald Trump's not gonna let you be robbed, myself be robbed, or him be robbed, or his family.
[00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:35.994]  There has to come a point at which you say, enough.
[00:15:42.657 --> 00:15:56.751]  Well, it seems like the gold star father, Khazir Khan, is actually now in panic mode after Breitbart exposed the fact that he was running a law firm that was specializing in the pay-to-play Muslim migration into America.
[00:15:57.131 --> 00:16:03.197]  Of course, everything he was saying on stage there at the DNC was basically in support of his business.
[00:16:03.237 --> 00:16:06.100]  Of course, he would be against a Muslim ban from countries
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:06.760]  I don't
[00:16:23.558 --> 00:16:40.010]  Less than a month ago, but they took a snapshot of this now-deleted website captured by the Wayback Machine, but they exposed the fact there on this website, it was talking about the EB-5 program, which helps wealthy foreigners, usually from the Middle East, buy their way into America.
[00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.812]  And of course, this program has been called out before.
[00:16:42.832 --> 00:16:44.073]  It's fraught with corruption.
[00:16:44.513 --> 00:16:44.774]  U.S.
[00:16:44.854 --> 00:16:51.619]  Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Senator Chuck Grassley has detailed such corruption over the past several months.
[00:16:52.399 --> 00:17:13.727]  And he talks about one section of a memo outlining concerns that it could be used by Iranian operatives to infiltrate the U.S., identifying seven main areas of program vulnerability, including the export of sensitive technology, economic espionage, use by foreign government agents and terrorists, investment fraud, illicit finance, and money laundering.
[00:17:14.167 --> 00:17:20.372]  So, this is something that Mr. Khan is kind of actively involved in, but that's not it.
[00:17:20.852 --> 00:17:28.478]  Of course, it's also interesting on the now-deleted website, Khan revealed that he spent nearly a decade working for the mega-D.C.
[00:17:28.538 --> 00:17:32.401]  law firm Hogan & Hartson, which is now Hogan Lovell's LLP.
[00:17:32.861 --> 00:17:37.165]  It connects him directly with the government of Saudi Arabia and the Clintons themselves.
[00:17:37.645 --> 00:17:41.048]  Saudi Arabia has retained the firm that Khan worked at for years,
[00:17:41.688 --> 00:18:02.419]  They donated between 10 and 25 million to the Clinton Foundation and Hogan Lovells also did Hillary Clinton's taxes and helped acquire the patents for parts of the technology that she used in crafting her illicit homebrew email server that the FBI director called extremely careless in handling her classified information.
[00:18:02.759 --> 00:18:18.471]  So here, once again, the Democrats are rolling out this person to try to literally destroy Donald Trump, but they didn't even do their research, and Breitbart actually sought some kind of feedback from reporters who were pushing the story, saying, didn't you guys do any research?
[00:18:18.751 --> 00:18:20.733]  And none of them actually did.
[00:18:20.753 --> 00:18:24.896]  So stick around, because we've got some more reports coming right up after this.
[00:18:38.666 --> 00:18:45.374]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:18:45.634 --> 00:18:47.717]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:19:01.423 --> 00:19:02.425]  Brain Force is here.
[00:19:02.966 --> 00:19:05.250]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:19:05.531 --> 00:19:13.385]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:19:14.161 --> 00:19:17.742]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:19:17.762 --> 00:19:20.122]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:19:20.482 --> 00:19:24.003]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:19:24.043 --> 00:19:27.204]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:19:27.704 --> 00:19:32.465]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:19:33.025 --> 00:19:34.905]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:19:35.245 --> 00:19:39.686]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:41.867]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:19:42.507 --> 00:19:43.967]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:19:44.127 --> 00:19:44.367]  Exactly.
[00:19:44.387 --> 00:19:48.209]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:19:48.709 --> 00:19:56.733]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:20:02.028 --> 00:20:05.090]  We have ended the big mega sale, the biggest in our history.
[00:20:05.511 --> 00:20:08.653]  Now, we have kept three items, though, this week.
[00:20:09.033 --> 00:20:14.097]  That's Brain Force, while supplies last, the amazing Nootropic for $17.76, normally $29.
[00:20:14.517 --> 00:20:16.839]  Leading competitors that have similar formulas are $60 to $70 to $80.
[00:20:16.899 --> 00:20:20.041]  So we're already a great deal at that price.
[00:20:20.121 --> 00:20:22.863]  It has some ingredients that are controlled or prescription in Europe.
[00:20:23.224 --> 00:20:24.324]  That's how powerful it is.
[00:20:24.745 --> 00:20:26.826]  Read about it for yourself at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:20:28.027 --> 00:20:28.907]  That's 40% off.

[00:20:31.008 --> 00:20:32.929]  It's a big deal to offer 30% off on that.
[00:20:34.189 --> 00:20:35.070]  We're extending that.
[00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:36.970]  And then Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:20:37.031 --> 00:20:41.072]  All the vitamins, all the minerals, the amino acids, the cofactors to help upload it.
[00:20:41.112 --> 00:20:42.313]  Great tasting fruit punch.
[00:20:42.973 --> 00:20:43.933]  Organically flavored.
[00:20:44.333 --> 00:20:46.114]  There's nothing else out there like it.
[00:20:46.174 --> 00:20:46.774]  It's amazing.
[00:20:47.094 --> 00:20:48.255]  It's plant-derived minerals.
[00:20:49.577 --> 00:20:52.478]  InfoWarsLive.com, that's 30% off.
[00:20:52.738 --> 00:20:53.599]  But I'm gonna go further.
[00:20:54.139 --> 00:20:54.939]  Boom, here it is.
[00:20:54.999 --> 00:20:57.440]  Normally you sign up for auto-ship, you get 10% off.
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:58.700]  You still get that on top of it.
[00:20:59.261 --> 00:21:00.301]  I'm doing free shipping on everything.
[00:21:00.721 --> 00:21:12.145]  Whether it's one Hillary for Prison shirt, or a Bill Clinton rape shirt, or whatever it is, whatever informational warfare weapon you want to help spread the word and meet like-minded people, free shipping store-wide.
[00:21:12.286 --> 00:21:13.786]  Free shipping, store-wide.

[00:21:19.815 --> 00:21:22.956]  You can get 30% off on DNA Force.
[00:21:23.696 --> 00:21:25.376]  I'm not going to sit here and belabor this.
[00:21:25.616 --> 00:21:43.101]  People should really go read and see the hundreds of studies that are there breaking down just what BioPQQ does and why this is such an amazing nutraceutical.
[00:21:44.144 --> 00:21:49.727]  And why it's so important that folks take it daily, because the compounds in this are just amazing.
[00:21:49.767 --> 00:21:51.088]  I mean, you just know they're from God.
[00:21:52.329 --> 00:21:53.470]  But I'm not going to get into the science.
[00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:55.211]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:55.611 --> 00:22:01.395]  Go there to the page for yourself, and you can check it all out at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:01.435 --> 00:22:09.400]  InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site, and your purchases make it possible, everything we do here.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.962]  So I want to thank you all for your support, your prayers,
[00:22:14.426 --> 00:22:15.227]  And so much more.
[00:22:36.306 --> 00:22:42.051]  If there's any mention of a disease or anything in there, it can't go up online because of the regulations with the FDA.
[00:22:42.131 --> 00:22:45.694]  So, please feel free to call in as much as you want.
[00:22:45.874 --> 00:22:48.076]  We love hearing about your stories.
[00:22:48.656 --> 00:22:58.545]  And this is just DNA for us, but, you know, the best thing that I love to do and the best thing I tell people to do is just go online to Infowarslife.com and just read all the reviews.
[00:23:06.451 --> 00:23:18.635]  The mainstream media has declared a war on Donald Trump, favoring what their globalist masters have ordered their propagandized professions to twist into pretzel logic to sway the votes towards Hillary Clinton.
[00:23:18.835 --> 00:23:24.277]  Donald Trump didn't take too kindly to the attack on his character by Khazir Khan at the DNC.
[00:23:24.377 --> 00:23:30.179]  Donald Trump, you're asking Americans to trust you with their future.
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.481]  Let me ask you,
[00:23:36.465 --> 00:23:39.667]  Have you even read the United States Constitution?
[00:23:44.749 --> 00:23:51.053]  I will gladly lend you my copy.
[00:23:52.418 --> 00:23:56.121]  A few moments ago he said that Donald Trump has a black soul.
[00:23:56.141 --> 00:23:57.802]  What's your response to that?
[00:24:11.113 --> 00:24:14.897]  I'd reject that, and I'm disappointed that he would say that.
[00:24:14.998 --> 00:24:17.140]  Donald Trump complimented him.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.164]  He praised his son who gave his life for this country.
[00:24:22.025 --> 00:24:24.728]  Mr. Khan's son served in the military.
[00:24:25.049 --> 00:24:30.094]  He did his duty, and he gave his life for America, and that deserves to be celebrated, absolutely.
[00:24:30.114 --> 00:24:31.356]  What would you say to that, Father?
[00:24:31.596 --> 00:24:35.717]  Well, I'd say we've had a lot of problems with radical Islamic terrorism.
[00:24:35.797 --> 00:24:36.477]  That's what I'd say.
[00:24:36.798 --> 00:24:42.899]  You look at San Bernardino, you look at Orlando, you look at the World Trade Center, you look at so many different things.
[00:24:42.939 --> 00:24:47.381]  You look at what happened to the priest over the weekend in Paris where his throat was cut.
[00:24:47.401 --> 00:24:50.542]  85-year-old beloved Catholic priest.
[00:24:51.102 --> 00:24:53.923]  You look at what happened in Nice, France a couple of weeks ago.
[00:24:54.743 --> 00:24:58.304]  I'd say you got to take a look at that because something's going on and it's not good.
[00:24:58.584 --> 00:25:03.929]  John McCain says, I cannot emphasize enough how deeply I disagree with Mr. Trump's statement.
[00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:10.996]  I hope America understand that the remarks do not represent the views of our Republican Party, its officers, or candidates.
[00:25:11.256 --> 00:25:15.820]  Notice how the Clinton News Network presided over the ongoing smear campaign.
[00:25:16.041 --> 00:25:18.743]  Meanwhile, a real criminal offense is occurring.
[00:25:18.883 --> 00:25:22.727]  Kurt Nimmo writes, In 2013, Hillary Clinton lied to Congress.
[00:25:23.007 --> 00:25:33.835]  During testimony on the Benghazi attack, Clinton denied she knew anything about the rat line running weapons from Libya to jihadis in Syria, including Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.
[00:25:34.075 --> 00:25:36.437]  Lying to Congress is a serious offense.
[00:25:36.717 --> 00:25:39.559]  It can result in a five-year maximum prison sentence.
[00:25:39.759 --> 00:25:45.844]  If the lie involves terrorism, the maximum prison sentence under Section 1001 of U.S.
[00:25:45.904 --> 00:25:47.465]  Code is eight years.
[00:25:47.865 --> 00:25:51.028]  Senator Rand Paul grilled Clinton on the arms transfer.
[00:25:51.414 --> 00:25:53.775]  Now my question is, is the U.S.
[00:25:53.855 --> 00:26:03.157]  involved with any procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons, buying, selling, anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey out of Libya?
[00:26:06.117 --> 00:26:06.818]  To Turkey?
[00:26:06.838 --> 00:26:09.578]  I will have to take that question for the record.
[00:26:10.358 --> 00:26:11.579]  Nobody's ever raised that with me.
[00:26:12.579 --> 00:26:17.800]  It's been in news reports that ships have been leaving from Libya and that they may have weapons.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.721]  And what I'd like to know is the annex that was close by.
[00:26:21.223 --> 00:26:24.931]  Were they involved with procuring, buying, selling, obtaining weapons?
[00:26:25.533 --> 00:26:29.482]  And were any of these weapons being transferred to other countries, any countries, Turkey included?
[00:26:29.887 --> 00:26:35.889]  Well, Senator, you'll have to direct that question to the agency that ran the annex.
[00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:39.171]  I will see what information is available.
[00:26:40.211 --> 00:26:41.212]  You're saying you don't know?
[00:26:41.512 --> 00:26:42.092]  I do not know.
[00:26:42.432 --> 00:26:43.813]  I don't have any information on that.
[00:26:43.913 --> 00:26:47.674]  Not only did Clinton know about the arms program, she oversaw it.
[00:26:47.814 --> 00:26:54.297]  Memos retrieved from the Benghazi compound show Clinton's State Department was involved in weapons transfers.
[00:26:54.477 --> 00:27:00.682]  Julian Assange told Democracy Now, Wikileaks has emails that will further demonstrate Clinton's role.
[00:27:00.842 --> 00:27:16.575]  The absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Qaddafi government, which led to the occupation of ISIS of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton into jihadists within Syria, including ISIS.
[00:27:16.815 --> 00:27:18.516]  That's there in those emails.
[00:27:18.796 --> 00:27:22.059]  That is treason on display, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:22.259 --> 00:27:22.780]  We're good to go.
[00:27:38.141 --> 00:27:46.667]  However, Washington Times reported, Homeland Security granted a new temporary amnesty Monday to more than 8,000 Syrians living in the U.S.
[00:27:46.747 --> 00:27:52.031]  right now, saying they can remain for up to 18 months longer, no matter what their legal status.
[00:27:52.271 --> 00:28:03.919]  Mr. Khan, Senator McCain, and President Obama, you can't just choose to ignore the clear and present danger entering the United States because you rest on an opinionated political platform.
[00:28:04.099 --> 00:28:13.188]  The terrorism we have already endured and face in the very near future is a stone cold reality with innocent American lives hanging in the balance.
[00:28:13.488 --> 00:28:17.452]  Those attacking Trump now will be held accountable later.
[00:28:17.892 --> 00:28:19.914]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:28:32.779 --> 00:28:36.124]  Jakari Jackson, I'm going to talk to you here today about the ATF.
[00:28:36.584 --> 00:28:41.992]  Now before we get into new developments with the agency, I want you to listen to this discussion I had yesterday with the gentleman.
[00:28:42.192 --> 00:28:46.298]  We talked about a great many things, but this is what he had to say specifically about the ATF.
[00:28:47.702 --> 00:28:56.324]  Like we've seen with the rise of the extreme right here and other action with the NRA, they're kind of banking and trying to basically fund fear.
[00:28:56.744 --> 00:29:07.426]  Like if you defund, if you use your lobbying dollars to defund the organization that's supposed to stop illegal guns, you're telling people that yes, there are illegal guns on the street, but you're the one making it happen.
[00:29:07.786 --> 00:29:13.367]  And you're banking on that fear to have, to scare people enough to go buy weapons and bring them places.
[00:29:14.247 --> 00:29:17.950]  And that, to me, is insidious and slightly inhuman.
[00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:22.453]  So, just so I understand what you're saying, are you saying that the NRA is lobbying to defund ATF?
[00:29:22.473 --> 00:29:23.053]  Is that what you said?
[00:29:23.073 --> 00:29:23.674]  They have done that.
[00:29:23.694 --> 00:29:23.934]  It was in 2004.
[00:29:24.094 --> 00:29:25.575]  It's called the T-Heart Amendment.
[00:29:25.995 --> 00:29:30.058]  Well, among many other things, the ATF has given guns to Mexican drug cartels.
[00:29:30.799 --> 00:29:31.119]  Great.
[00:29:31.339 --> 00:29:32.460]  So have so many people.
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.021]  I don't know what you're trying to tell me with that.
[00:29:34.041 --> 00:29:40.025]  Well, the point I'm making is, why would you want to fund... Why would you fund an organization that gives guns to people like El Chapo?
[00:29:40.045 --> 00:29:40.986]  It's been on CBS News.
[00:29:42.239 --> 00:29:56.672]  Okay, um, well the point is, is... I mean, you're saying to get the bad guns off the street, get the hands off the guns of the bad people, but you have an organization who we know gave guns to Mexican drug cartels, and they kill people with those guns.
[00:29:56.953 --> 00:29:59.015]  So why would you want to fund an organization like that?
[00:29:59.035 --> 00:30:04.620]  What I'm saying, I'm not saying that the ATF is the greatest organization on the planet.
[00:30:05.598 --> 00:30:10.040]  Now I'm not even downing that guy because he's much more intellectual than most anti-gunners I meet.
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:14.021]  Most people say, like, I'm triggered by the gun and it looks scary and I don't want him around.
[00:30:14.281 --> 00:30:19.563]  This guy actually had intellectual arguments even though I didn't agree with his point of view, but that's enough on that.
[00:30:19.924 --> 00:30:22.124]  Let's talk about some new developments going on with the ATF.
[00:30:22.565 --> 00:30:27.366]  We see this article, the ATF is illegally hoarding American gun owners' personal information.
[00:30:27.847 --> 00:30:30.868]  Now we've seen time and time again, whether it's senators, congressmen,
[00:30:31.488 --> 00:30:39.612]  Presidents, whoever else, saying that the ATF or, you know, organizations in general do not keep the information of the American gun owner.
[00:30:40.193 --> 00:30:45.675]  And I know the government has said many other things, including but not limited to, read my lips, no new taxes.
[00:30:45.915 --> 00:30:47.656]  If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.
[00:30:47.676 --> 00:30:50.558]  And also, I did not have sexual relations with that woman.
[00:30:50.578 --> 00:30:51.859]  But of course, the government never lies.
[00:30:52.819 --> 00:30:53.219]  The U.S.
[00:30:53.259 --> 00:31:03.783]  Government Accountability Office conducted an audit of the ATF and found it does not remove certain identifiable information despite the law explicitly mandating it to do so.
[00:31:04.303 --> 00:31:17.848]  GOA conducted reviews of four data systems and concluded at least two of the ATF systems violated official protocols, which means they're keeping your information even though they're mandated by law to get rid of said information.
[00:31:17.888 --> 00:31:19.769]  But people just believe everything that they hear.
[00:31:20.189 --> 00:31:20.469]  I think so.
[00:31:42.808 --> 00:31:44.650]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:46.611]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[00:31:46.691 --> 00:31:49.413]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[00:31:49.633 --> 00:31:50.434]  Alex Jones.
[00:31:50.534 --> 00:31:53.296]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:31:53.356 --> 00:31:56.539]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:31:56.579 --> 00:31:57.840]  Deeply I think racist.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.841]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[00:31:59.941 --> 00:32:01.743]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[00:32:01.763 --> 00:32:05.846]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[00:32:05.866 --> 00:32:07.027]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:07.107 --> 00:32:11.670]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:32:12.711 --> 00:32:22.278]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[00:32:22.738 --> 00:32:24.460]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:25.200]  Think about it.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:31.185]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[00:32:31.445 --> 00:32:37.009]  But on the other hand, the Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:49.158]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[00:32:49.438 --> 00:32:52.200]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.862]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[00:32:55.183 --> 00:32:59.646]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[00:33:00.066 --> 00:33:00.647]  Think about it.
[00:33:02.529 --> 00:33:07.992]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[00:33:08.532 --> 00:33:09.033]  Unveiled!
[00:33:09.433 --> 00:33:12.494]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula.
[00:33:13.175 --> 00:33:13.635]  30 servings.
[00:33:13.835 --> 00:33:16.437]  Fruit punch flavor dietary supplement.
[00:33:16.737 --> 00:33:17.797]  It is simply amazing.
[00:33:17.857 --> 00:33:18.798]  Infowarslife.com
[00:33:19.198 --> 00:33:23.600]  There's a million different products like this out there, but they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:37.227]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all the essential amino acids, all the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:38.808]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:40.029]  I put it in my protein shake.
[00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:46.133]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:49.175]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:51.456]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[00:33:52.057 --> 00:33:58.201]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:00.783]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[00:34:01.143 --> 00:34:03.004]  Okay, this... Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:05.346]  Yeah, this... I wanna... But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:05.726]  Yeah.
[00:34:05.946 --> 00:34:07.447]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:10.349]  There's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com that are excellent.
[00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:11.909]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.152]  This is just the very best we can bring you, and when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:39.919]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body, because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:41.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:41.087 --> 00:34:44.228]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[00:34:44.328 --> 00:34:45.568]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:46.168]  Tell folks about that.
[00:34:46.328 --> 00:34:49.088]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.589]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:55.670]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine.
[00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.510]  Each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.131]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:04.691]  34 other ones you can check out.
[00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.731]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:09.552]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:19.939]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just by the way look on the other side too because we're showing people the minerals and things let's look at the vitamins right there old Scott in there I mean it's amazing.
[00:35:19.979 --> 00:35:20.440]  Top left.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.862]  Again if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.285]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's the other source?
[00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.707]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:32.806]  Retinol.
[00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:37.328]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[00:35:37.649 --> 00:35:38.049]  And you know what?
[00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:40.290]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.110]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:48.154]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:53.997]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:55.358]  So get them today!

[00:36:02.363 --> 00:36:08.288]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[00:36:08.508 --> 00:36:09.649]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:25.219]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:29.582]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:36:33.604 --> 00:36:40.690]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:36:41.031 --> 00:36:46.696]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.

[00:37:04.369 --> 00:37:06.710]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:13.753]  Vladimir Putin gave a very troubling warning to the West that went largely unnoticed by Western media outlets here in the States.
[00:37:14.373 --> 00:37:22.456]  He warned of our aggressive foreign policy measures, specifically that missile defense system that we placed in Romania, dangerously close to the Russian border.
[00:37:22.476 --> 00:37:26.157]  I want to play you a clip of what Vladimir Putin had to say about our measures.
[00:37:26.537 --> 00:37:27.818]  We translated it for you.
[00:37:28.218 --> 00:37:28.758]  Take a listen.
[00:37:30.319 --> 00:37:32.820]  We know year by year what's going to happen, and they know we know.
[00:37:35.151 --> 00:37:40.174]  It's only you that they tell these fables and you buy it and spread it to the citizens of your countries.
[00:37:41.374 --> 00:37:44.476]  Your people do not feel a sense of the impending danger.
[00:37:44.756 --> 00:37:46.277]  This is what worries me.
[00:37:46.517 --> 00:37:50.659]  How do you not understand that the world is being pulled in an irreversible direction?
[00:37:50.819 --> 00:37:51.820]  That is the problem.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.001]  But they pretend like nothing's going on.
[00:37:54.021 --> 00:37:57.003]  I don't even know how to get through to you people anymore.
[00:37:57.703 --> 00:38:06.732]  Now, that clip, he indicates that we're making very troubling foreign policy decisions which cannot be undone, specifically the missiles that we claim are defensive measures.
[00:38:07.533 --> 00:38:09.534]  They fall under something called the START Treaty.
[00:38:09.554 --> 00:38:13.178]  It was established in 2010 that allows the U.S.
[00:38:13.358 --> 00:38:17.662]  and Russia, for that matter, to place missiles specifically in areas where they'd like to test.
[00:38:17.742 --> 00:38:19.164]  Now, the U.S.
[00:38:19.284 --> 00:38:22.367]  anti-missile defense system, it was installed near the border.
[00:38:22.847 --> 00:38:30.271]  Putin is saying that inconspicuously it could be transformed into offensive weapons and that he doesn't trust that we're using them defensively.
[00:38:30.711 --> 00:38:40.036]  Now, three days ago on the Kremlin's website, he has decided to set up a spy apparatus specifically targeting the missile defense system in Romania.
[00:38:40.136 --> 00:38:42.438]  He announced it on the website in English.
[00:38:42.998 --> 00:38:43.298]  That's right.
[00:39:06.238 --> 00:39:09.019]  When these tests violate the START Treaty.
[00:39:09.079 --> 00:39:19.022]  Now, I went on the State Department's website to find out more about the START Treaty, what exactly it entails, and how and if we would be violating it, what they could specifically do about it.
[00:39:19.102 --> 00:39:20.343]  Now, the U.S.
[00:39:20.583 --> 00:39:28.265]  and the Russian Federation at the time, they put forth these measures to reduce and limit strategic offensive arms.
[00:39:28.365 --> 00:39:29.226]  That was its goal.
[00:39:29.266 --> 00:39:30.626]  It was enacted in February of 2011.
[00:39:30.706 --> 00:39:31.126]  This predates
[00:39:33.607 --> 00:39:34.027]  I think.
[00:39:49.738 --> 00:39:49.878]  I think.
[00:40:04.775 --> 00:40:05.456]  Look at the U.S.
[00:40:05.516 --> 00:40:07.577]  complete disregard for this treaty.
[00:40:07.617 --> 00:40:18.325]  If Russia finds out that we're actually being dishonest, that we're not holding up our end of the bargain, that we're testing missiles on their border, couldn't we see this go down a path, say, like the Cuban Missile Crisis, for example?
[00:40:18.365 --> 00:40:26.611]  Do we really want to get into a nuclear dance with Russia at this point, where we're toying, what we're toying with is quite dangerous, as you can see.
[00:40:26.631 --> 00:40:28.712]  And not only that, but we've seen Russia in our
[00:40:28.932 --> 00:40:32.155]  I cannot help asking those who have caused this situation
[00:40:57.418 --> 00:40:59.036]  Do you realize now what you've done?
[00:41:14.175 --> 00:41:24.824]  What if I told you that perhaps the biggest news story of the year so far has been completely ignored or, better put, covered up by the mainstream media?
[00:41:25.184 --> 00:41:29.687]  No doubt our audience wouldn't be totally surprised by that revelation.
[00:41:29.748 --> 00:41:43.519]  However, I think the average person on the street would be totally shocked to find out that Russian President Vladimir Putin believes a war between Russia and the United States and its NATO allies is imminent.
[00:41:44.298 --> 00:41:59.088]  Diplomatic relations have deteriorated and NATO's deployment of anti-missile systems in Europe is a direct violation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the INF, between Russia and the United States.
[00:41:59.549 --> 00:42:09.716]  And that's because these anti-missile systems that NATO is putting on Russia's borders can easily and quickly be repurposed or converted to facilities
[00:42:10.396 --> 00:42:14.537]  Capable of firing short and mid-range missiles.
[00:42:15.217 --> 00:42:27.480]  In a meeting with foreign press just last month, Vladimir Putin left no one in any doubt that the world is heading down a course which could lead to a nuclear war.
[00:42:28.841 --> 00:42:31.561]  We know year by year what's going to happen and they know we know.
[00:42:33.682 --> 00:42:38.163]  It's only you that they tell these fables and you buy it and spread it to the citizens of your countries.
[00:42:39.884 --> 00:42:42.987]  Your people do not feel a sense of the impending danger.
[00:42:43.267 --> 00:42:44.388]  This is what worries me.
[00:42:45.029 --> 00:42:49.173]  How do you not understand that the world is being pulled in an irreversible direction?
[00:42:49.333 --> 00:42:50.334]  That is the problem.
[00:42:50.594 --> 00:42:52.496]  But they pretend like nothing's going on.
[00:42:52.516 --> 00:42:55.519]  I don't even know how to get through to you people anymore.
[00:42:56.127 --> 00:43:02.374]  Now this is probably one of the most important political speeches since the run-up to World War II.
[00:43:03.215 --> 00:43:10.764]  And most historians agree that we are seeing a lot of parallels right now to the start of World War I and World War II.
[00:43:11.465 --> 00:43:12.866]  Russia says the U.S.
[00:43:13.006 --> 00:43:18.229]  is making it more difficult for them to avoid the outbreak of large-scale conflicts.
[00:43:18.649 --> 00:43:25.333]  Vladimir Putin just signed a document declaring NATO a threat to their national security.
[00:43:25.773 --> 00:43:34.639]  He also says we are on the brink of war and the fact that you are not hearing about any of this on the mainstream news shows just how controlled
[00:43:35.492 --> 00:43:36.293]  The media is.
[00:43:36.893 --> 00:43:41.377]  We are witnessing one of the most unstable times in human history.
[00:43:41.737 --> 00:43:49.483]  And we're joined now by former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under Ronald Reagan, Paul Craig Roberts, the father of Reaganomics.
[00:43:49.703 --> 00:43:55.308]  And I'm glad you're with us this evening because it looks like Russia is no longer playing games.
[00:43:55.908 --> 00:44:13.911]  The United States has them basically backed up into a corner, and I wanted to get your take on Vladimir Putin's speech last month, where he warned about the possibility of a nuclear exchange with the United States, and also get your take on why you think the mainstream media just remains silent on this story.
[00:44:13.951 --> 00:44:17.372]  I think it's a big story, yet nobody's talking about it.
[00:44:17.432 --> 00:44:17.712]  Why?
[00:44:19.332 --> 00:44:21.952]  Well, the West doesn't have a media, you know that.
[00:44:22.132 --> 00:44:24.493]  They have six big
[00:44:25.464 --> 00:44:29.186]  In the United States, the six big companies own 90% of the media.
[00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:36.391]  And basically, it's not allowed to function as a media.
[00:44:36.551 --> 00:44:39.333]  So, you don't get any news.
[00:44:40.593 --> 00:44:45.957]  You just get the propaganda from Washington and from the corporations.
[00:44:45.997 --> 00:44:47.738]  That's all you get from the American media.
[00:44:48.698 --> 00:44:52.201]  And, you know, we have this former German editor,
[00:44:53.143 --> 00:45:02.232]  Who wrote the book, he said that he was on the CIA's payroll and so was every significant journalist in Europe.
[00:45:03.994 --> 00:45:06.916]  And this goes all the way back to the days of Operation Mockingbird.
[00:45:07.137 --> 00:45:16.426]  I mean, the CIA pretty much infiltrated, and other intelligence organizations as well, they infiltrated our media from the very get-go.
[00:45:18.333 --> 00:45:18.854]  That's right.
[00:45:19.975 --> 00:45:25.960]  But of course, now it's worse because the media in the United States is concentrated.
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:27.681]  It's now in six hands.
[00:45:28.061 --> 00:45:28.361]  Yeah.
[00:45:29.062 --> 00:45:32.124]  So that makes it even easier to control.
[00:45:32.245 --> 00:45:43.413]  So what Putin was, he was speaking to journalists, I think, not just Americans, but all of Europe.
[00:45:43.634 --> 00:45:43.874]  Yeah.
[00:45:44.394 --> 00:45:45.935]  And what he was telling them was that
[00:45:47.603 --> 00:46:05.456]  They, by repeating propaganda about Russia and accusations against Russia, they were enabling the United States and NATO to keep putting military-type pressures on Russia.
[00:46:06.477 --> 00:46:11.663]  And that at some point these pressures would no longer be tolerable by Russia.
[00:46:11.703 --> 00:46:13.525]  They simply won't accept them.
[00:46:14.345 --> 00:46:19.411]  I think particularly he means the missiles in Poland and Romania.
[00:46:21.091 --> 00:46:32.957]  Because these missiles can be put there as ABMs, anti-ballistic missiles, but they can be very easily changed into strategic nuclear attack missiles.
[00:46:33.177 --> 00:46:40.720]  So you think this is a violation of nuclear arms treaty back to your day when, you know, Ronald Reagan signed the nuclear arms treaty.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.301]  It was the IMF treaty.
[00:46:43.001 --> 00:46:51.806]  And because these aren't just nuclear, anti-nuclear missile systems, like you said, they could be converted almost overnight into ballistic missiles.
[00:46:52.126 --> 00:46:54.887]  We're talking short-range and medium-range missiles.
[00:46:54.968 --> 00:46:55.308]  Am I right?

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.244 --> 00:48:52.725]  I don't know.
[00:49:05.117 --> 00:49:06.979]  Well, that was just one of her lies.
[00:49:07.039 --> 00:49:18.974]  And of course, last week, as we had DNC emails released, we saw that Bernie Sanders, who had said previously they didn't really care to hear any more about those damn emails, suddenly he was interested when it affected him personally.
[00:49:19.435 --> 00:49:23.921]  So he couldn't be interested about the coup in Libya, for example, which is what we're going to talk about today.
[00:49:24.621 --> 00:49:30.323]  But maybe he could get interested about a coup against democracy, against our elections.
[00:49:30.863 --> 00:49:39.146]  You know, when Julian Assange was talking last week as these emails were breaking for the DNC, he had an interesting observation about what it told us about Hillary Clinton's character.
[00:49:39.626 --> 00:49:45.068]  And when he was talking to Democracy Now!, he said, it's important for there to be examples of accountability.
[00:49:45.088 --> 00:49:48.289]  His resignation of W. Wasserman Schultz was an example of that.
[00:49:48.329 --> 00:49:52.610]  Now, of course, Hillary Clinton has tried to immediately produce a counterexample
[00:49:53.230 --> 00:50:00.380]  By putting out a statement within hours saying that she's a great friend and she's going to incorporate her into her campaign.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.623]  She's going to be pushing for her re-election to Congress.
[00:50:03.143 --> 00:50:07.569]  So he said, Julian Assange said, that's a very interesting signaling by Hillary Clinton.
[00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:11.094]  That if you act in a corrupt way that benefits Hillary Clinton,
[00:50:11.574 --> 00:50:13.515]  You will be taken care of.
[00:50:14.015 --> 00:50:15.496]  Why does she need to put that out, he said?
[00:50:15.896 --> 00:50:18.117]  Certainly it's not a signal that helps the public at all.
[00:50:18.377 --> 00:50:23.660]  It's not a signal that helps with unity at the upcoming, at that time, DNC convention.
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:30.063]  It's a signal to Hillary Clinton partisans to keep on going on because you'll be taken care of.
[00:50:30.783 --> 00:50:34.485]  So today, on a day when we have Obama holding a press conference,
[00:50:35.535 --> 00:50:38.419]  Saying that Donald Trump is unfit for office.
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:48.392]  I think it's important for us to go back and look at what we and others in the authentic media have been exposing about what happened in Libya for five, six years.
[00:50:48.412 --> 00:50:49.874]  And I'm not just talking about Benghazi.
[00:50:49.914 --> 00:50:51.617]  Today we're not going to talk about Benghazi at all.
[00:50:52.077 --> 00:50:56.280]  We're going to talk about things that happened a year before that, as the coup was unfolding.
[00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:58.822]  We're going to talk about the reasons behind the coup.
[00:50:59.102 --> 00:51:01.964]  We're going to talk about what was going to happen after the coup.
[00:51:02.364 --> 00:51:10.590]  And we're going to see that not only did Hillary Clinton and others know about a black genocide that was being committed in Libya,
[00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:14.373]  They were informed of this before the worst atrocities happened.
[00:51:14.833 --> 00:51:22.260]  At the same time, the people who want to confiscate guns in America were running arms to ISIS, to Al Qaeda.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:23.661]  As a matter of fact, they were creating ISIS.
[00:51:23.761 --> 00:51:28.225]  They knew that they were going to create an Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
[00:51:28.245 --> 00:51:29.045]  That's what ISIS is.
[00:51:29.105 --> 00:51:30.206]  They knew that was going to happen.
[00:51:30.547 --> 00:51:31.648]  They did it anyway.
[00:51:32.208 --> 00:51:43.601]  And so these emails that have been coming out, as well as other documents that were released by Judicial Watch under a Freedom of Information Act request, all of these things have basically been in the background.
[00:51:43.681 --> 00:51:53.111]  We've been telling you about it, just as the NSA whistleblowers told everyone right after September 11th that the NSA was illegally doing dragnet spying on the American public.
[00:51:53.627 --> 00:51:56.609]  Nobody paid much attention to them until the Snowden documents.
[00:51:56.989 --> 00:52:14.961]  Hopefully, now that we see these documents from the DNC and people are looking at the gossipy aspects of it, maybe we can get to some of the real meat and we can show the hypocrisy of these criminals who acted in a way that was dismissed at the time we were talking about what was happening.
[00:52:15.001 --> 00:52:19.064]  We saw reports and it was thrown out as just being conspiracy theories.
[00:52:19.144 --> 00:52:21.385]  No, it was a conspiracy reality.
[00:52:21.805 --> 00:52:23.506]  It was a criminal conspiracy.
[00:52:23.826 --> 00:52:29.369]  It was a Machiavellian plan to create ISIS, and they didn't care who died in the process.
[00:52:29.389 --> 00:52:33.411]  And we're going to see some of the blowback that is happening in France now.
[00:52:33.431 --> 00:52:36.732]  We're going to see that, of course, France was a major actor in this.
[00:52:37.112 --> 00:52:42.535]  They sowed end of the wind, and now they are reaping the whirlwind in France.
[00:52:43.115 --> 00:52:44.937]  Let's take a look at this article here today.
[00:52:44.997 --> 00:52:48.961]  New American says that these emails are exposing Clinton's gun running to terrorists.
[00:52:48.981 --> 00:52:56.809]  As they point out, these once-secret emails show that they were shipping weapons to jihadists, including terrorists and ISIS.
[00:52:57.269 --> 00:53:03.716]  They also reveal that Muammar Gaddafi wanted to create a gold-backed currency for the region.
[00:53:04.016 --> 00:53:07.657]  And that was one of the key reasons that the globalists wanted to shut down this operation.
[00:53:07.677 --> 00:53:12.279]  Of course, this was already exposed by many people five or six years ago.
[00:53:12.379 --> 00:53:19.261]  We knew about the fact that Muammar Gaddafi had set apart gold for that very purpose, to back his currency.
[00:53:19.541 --> 00:53:22.862]  And he was encouraging other African nations to join with him.
[00:53:23.402 --> 00:53:34.333]  To sell their oil not in the American petrodollar, that is what the United States and Saudi Arabia have contrived to create in order to back up our fiat currency.
[00:53:34.573 --> 00:53:42.701]  He was going to directly challenge the central banks of America and Europe with a real currency that was backed in gold.
[00:53:43.301 --> 00:53:46.765]  And they were going to directly challenge the petrodollar at the same time.
[00:53:47.305 --> 00:53:50.147]  I believe that's one of the key reasons that they did this.
[00:53:50.167 --> 00:53:59.773]  We're always told, of course, that they have to start these wars to keep us safe, and yet the reality is they start these wars to protect their financial interests.
[00:53:59.793 --> 00:54:01.154]  That's what these emails reveal.
[00:54:01.194 --> 00:54:03.816]  So let's quickly take a look at what's going on with this.
[00:54:05.362 --> 00:54:10.564]  In addition, they knew that Libyan rebels were massacring blacks as part of ethnic cleansing.
[00:54:10.985 --> 00:54:13.226]  Let's take a look at the actual email.
[00:54:13.266 --> 00:54:20.769]  This is an email from Sidney Blumenthal to Hillary Clinton, referencing France's client and Gaddafi's goal.
[00:54:20.809 --> 00:54:22.470]  This was back in April of 2011.
[00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:27.752]  What they say in this is that there is cultivation by France.
[00:54:27.792 --> 00:54:30.713]  This is Blumenthal's analysis for Hillary Clinton.
[00:54:31.094 --> 00:54:33.835]  France is cultivating clients among the rebels.
[00:54:34.375 --> 00:54:41.260]  Leading figures closest to the French are believed to have made payments of an unknown amount to this particular individual, Yonis, who was there.
[00:54:41.741 --> 00:54:49.767]  They say also, in strictest confidence, that the freezing of Libya's foreign bank accounts doesn't really present Gaddafi with serious challenges.
[00:54:49.847 --> 00:54:51.388]  He holds 143 tons of gold and a similar amount in silver.
[00:54:53.590 --> 00:55:03.396]  And they say the gold was accumulated prior to the current rebellion and was intended to be used to establish a pan-African currency based on the Libyan golden dinar.
[00:55:03.697 --> 00:55:09.821]  The plan was designed to provide the francophone African countries with an alternative to the French franc.
[00:55:10.961 --> 00:55:14.443]  They say his quantity of gold and silver is valued at more than $7 billion.
[00:55:14.804 --> 00:55:19.567]  French intelligence officers discovered this plan shortly after the current rebellion began.
[00:55:19.987 --> 00:55:28.272]  This is one of the factors that influenced President Sarkozy's decision to commit France to attack Libya because they wanted a greater share of Libyan oil.
[00:55:28.712 --> 00:55:31.394]  They wanted to increase France's influence in North Africa.
[00:55:31.754 --> 00:55:36.577]  They wanted to provide the French military with an opportunity to reassert its position in the world.
[00:55:37.097 --> 00:55:46.021]  And they wanted to address the concerns of his advisors over Gaddafi's long-term plans to supplant France as the dominant political power.
[00:55:46.421 --> 00:55:50.583]  Understand, this is a pure Machiavellian ploy that's going on here.
[00:55:51.004 --> 00:55:51.764]  They want the oil.
[00:55:52.204 --> 00:55:54.585]  They don't want to challenge to their fiat currencies.
[00:55:55.005 --> 00:55:58.107]  And so they go to war to create this kind of catastrophe.
[00:55:58.587 --> 00:56:16.316]  And of course, as it was pointed out at the time, going back by us and others, a New American said in November of 2011 that it's not exactly clear why Gaddafi's regime went from a model regime and an important ally at one moment to a target for regime change in just a few years.
[00:56:16.376 --> 00:56:21.178]  Of course, oil was part of it, but then they also point out how devastating that would be.
[00:56:21.198 --> 00:56:24.400]  And of course, that was the calculus of the French.
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:25.940]  It was the calculus of the
[00:56:27.401 --> 00:56:28.862]  American government as well.
[00:56:29.702 --> 00:56:33.684]  Let's talk quickly before we run out of time about the ethnic cleansing that was going on.
[00:56:34.285 --> 00:56:38.987]  Okay, going back to September 2011, we have reports.
[00:56:39.607 --> 00:56:43.709]  Well, that was a New American said that there was ethnic cleansing and black genocide at the time.
[00:56:43.729 --> 00:56:50.233]  They said there was horrific internment camps, systematic rape, torture, lynching, looting of businesses owned by blacks reported as well.
[00:56:50.693 --> 00:56:54.915]  They say there is a brigade for purging blacks and black skin.
[00:56:54.995 --> 00:56:56.356]  It was a rebel slogan.
[00:56:56.536 --> 00:56:57.976]  So these are the people that we're supporting.
[00:56:58.777 --> 00:57:00.517]  Do we want to talk about Black Lives Matter?
[00:57:01.237 --> 00:57:10.079]  Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were supporting the rebels whose slogan was, purging slaves and black skin.
[00:57:10.619 --> 00:57:10.919]  Okay?
[00:57:11.199 --> 00:57:12.700]  It was scrawled all along the road.
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:15.220]  They wiped out a town called Tarrega.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:19.341]  About 10,000 mostly black residents was wiped off of the map.
[00:57:19.601 --> 00:57:22.222]  A rebel commander said, this town no longer exists.
[00:57:22.262 --> 00:57:23.602]  That was reported by the Wall Street Journal.
[00:57:24.182 --> 00:57:29.507]  A rebel fighter boasted more recently, we're setting it on fire to prevent anyone from living here again.
[00:57:29.527 --> 00:57:37.474]  The Herald reported that, that was the Sydney Morning Herald, said anyone with dark skin regardless of their loyalties can find themselves a target.
[00:57:37.934 --> 00:57:39.515]  Did Hillary Clinton know this was going on?
[00:57:39.535 --> 00:57:39.756]  Yes.
[00:57:40.649 --> 00:57:52.255]  As the anti-media reported in a March 27, 2011 email, Blumenthal informs Clinton, quote, his troops continue to summarily execute all foreign mercenaries captured in the fighting.
[00:57:52.675 --> 00:57:59.418]  And they ask, well, summarily execute is a nice way of saying just straight up killing anybody they see, but how do they identify them as a foreign mercenary, he asks.
[00:57:59.858 --> 00:58:06.502]  Well, they determine who they are based merely on sight, based on the color of their skin.
[00:58:07.282 --> 00:58:11.883]  So as the Levant Report sums us up, we've got reports of black genocide.
[00:58:12.043 --> 00:58:16.004]  We know that special ops trainers from the West were in Libya from the very beginning.
[00:58:16.444 --> 00:58:19.805]  We know that Al-Qaeda was embedded in the U.S.-backed operations.
[00:58:20.225 --> 00:58:26.767]  We know that the claims about Viagra rape claims on the part of Qaddafi's soldiers were completely negative.
[00:58:26.827 --> 00:58:32.969]  And of course, the key reason of wars is to protect the bankers and to get the oil.
[00:58:33.709 --> 00:58:35.796]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[00:58:35.816 --> 00:58:37.982]  Join us again tomorrow at 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[00:58:38.043 --> 00:58:38.323]  Eastern.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.934]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.394 --> 00:59:20.085]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:24.166]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.726 --> 00:59:29.387]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
