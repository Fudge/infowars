[00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:21.816]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.936 --> 00:00:23.217]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.237 --> 00:00:27.619]  It is January 13th, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.823]  Tonight, InfoWars analysis of Obama's State of the Union address.
[00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:40.465]  How many bold-faced lies did he tell this time?
[00:00:40.945 --> 00:00:43.726]  Then, Iran releases 10 U.S.
[00:00:43.786 --> 00:00:47.208]  Navy sailors who were captured in the Persian Gulf.
[00:00:47.688 --> 00:00:53.152]  Plus, Senator Rand Paul reveals who killed the Audit the Fed bill.
[00:00:53.272 --> 00:00:55.734]  The good news is, you know, we got a majority yesterday.
[00:00:55.774 --> 00:01:00.837]  We got 53 votes for Auditing the Fed, and we needed 60, unfortunately.
[00:01:00.877 --> 00:01:03.159]  We were missing Ted Cruz, unfortunately.
[00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:05.300]  We got close, but we didn't quite get there.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.001]  But to me, it's a long fight.
[00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:08.222]  It's long overdue.
[00:01:08.782 --> 00:01:13.446]  The Federal Reserve really is responsible for a lot of the income inequality in our country.
[00:01:13.626 --> 00:01:16.748]  That's how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations.
[00:01:20.512 --> 00:01:26.956]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News!
[00:01:30.238 --> 00:01:31.599]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:33.160]  You can't survive without it.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.281]  But where do you get it?
[00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:40.324]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:01:40.564 --> 00:01:46.268]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:01:46.468 --> 00:02:03.329]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.850]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:07.391]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:08.452]  Easy assembly.
[00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:09.332]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:11.454]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:36.508]  Now, coming up later in our broadcast, we'll have a special report from Leanne McAdoo.
[00:02:36.828 --> 00:02:41.370]  She went out into the street and asked people what they would do if they won this massive lottery jackpot.
[00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:46.233]  Also, a special report from John Bowne, and I talked to printable gun pioneer Cody Wilson.
[00:02:46.593 --> 00:02:52.356]  But first, we go to Joe Biggs, who's on the streets in Charleston, South Carolina, getting ready for the RNC debate.
[00:02:52.376 --> 00:02:54.597]  All right, and thank you for joining us, Joe.
[00:02:55.404 --> 00:02:55.964]  Thanks Ja'Kari.
[00:02:56.004 --> 00:02:58.145]  Now we're standing outside of the Belmont Charleston place.
[00:02:58.465 --> 00:03:04.106]  Now this is the actual location where the RNC is meeting on whether or not they should go with the impeachment process.
[00:03:04.486 --> 00:03:06.667]  Now you can actually go to InfoWars.com.
[00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:12.549]  Steve Watson wrote an article about a week ago talking about the RNC considering impeachment proceedings.
[00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:21.131]  The resolution consists of 48 criminal charges for President Obama and it's titled Articles of Impeachment of Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:03:21.983 --> 00:03:23.525]  So that's happening here right now.
[00:03:23.565 --> 00:03:27.048]  This should be going on until about Friday from what I've heard thus far.
[00:03:27.388 --> 00:03:31.552]  Now also we have the first presidential debate of the GOP of 2016.
[00:03:31.813 --> 00:03:33.274]  That starts tomorrow.
[00:03:33.594 --> 00:03:37.158]  Now we do know that Fiorina has not been allowed to come back to this main stage.
[00:03:37.518 --> 00:03:39.600]  And also, Ran Paul.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:53.490]  So we want to come out here, have a chance to chime in on the Mystery Science Theater thing that we always do, where you guys will be commenting on the debate, as well as coming to us live with some feedback from people here at the debate as well.
[00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.895]  Thus far in the city, have you seen a lot of pageantry, a lot of gates laid out for crowds or anything like that in the city of Charleston?
[00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:02.903]  I haven't seen that here.
[00:04:02.983 --> 00:04:16.165]  We're actually further south from the North Charleston Coliseum where the debate will be, but here currently at this hotel where they're looking into the impeachment process, I haven't seen a lot of security or anything like that thus far.
[00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.094]  Yeah, the impeachment process, you know, it's been a pretty big polarizing thing.
[00:04:21.114 --> 00:04:23.576]  You know, a lot of people say we don't want to make Obama a martyr.
[00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:29.202]  Other people say, you know, we may not have until the end of the year to get rid of this guy and his policies.
[00:04:29.242 --> 00:04:32.026]  So it's going to be very interesting to see, you know, if this plays
[00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:46.034]  In this week's debate, as you know Joe, previously the Democrats have been having these debates on Saturday nights when Star Wars comes out, or the next one's going to be during the NFL playoffs from what I understand.
[00:04:46.394 --> 00:04:50.557]  So it's very interesting to me that they continue to have these debates at times when nobody's going to be watching.
[00:04:51.537 --> 00:04:52.138]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:52.178 --> 00:04:53.279]  It's like they're hiding from something.
[00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:58.902]  They know that that's going to make it look bad when you have a prime time audience that has their full attention.
[00:04:59.438 --> 00:05:14.409]  Hillary Clinton is going to have all of her skeletons come out in front of a large audience and they're using that mask of an NFL playoff game to escape behind that so people won't find out what's really going on when Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton start bickering back and forth.
[00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:25.898]  Now they have no problem with the Republicans going out on the main stage in front of a population that has no distractions whatsoever because people want to hammer down
[00:05:26.357 --> 00:05:28.719]  On the Republicans, people hate Donald Trump.
[00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:29.560]  A lot of people do.
[00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:34.965]  You know, you got a lot of people that are confused on whether or not Ted Cruz should be allowed to run for president.
[00:05:35.246 --> 00:05:41.952]  So there's a lot more WWE themed things with the RNC versus the Democratic debate.
[00:05:41.992 --> 00:05:43.594]  People want to keep that on the hush-hush.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.763]  Well it's going to be very interesting to see and of course as you alluded to we will have our live coverage here starting at 7 p.m.
[00:05:50.803 --> 00:05:51.083]  Central.
[00:05:51.103 --> 00:05:55.245]  The debate itself is going to start at 8 Central but I believe Leanne's going to do a piece.
[00:05:55.265 --> 00:06:00.767]  We'll start about 730 and then we'll be throwing to yourself and Richard Reeves live in Charleston, South Carolina.
[00:06:01.048 --> 00:06:02.208]  Thank you so much Joe Biggs.
[00:06:02.808 --> 00:06:10.232]  Well thank you and we also want to encourage as many people that are watching to come out and support us and let us hear your opinions on the upcoming presidential election.
[00:06:10.252 --> 00:06:10.852]  Thank you Jakari.
[00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:12.830]  And there goes Joe Biggs.
[00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.192]  Now, we're talking about the Republicans, but also there's the Democratic debate, as we alluded to.
[00:06:17.532 --> 00:06:21.134]  They want to have it during a time that nobody's watching, so we will not be covering that.
[00:06:21.394 --> 00:06:25.677]  If they want to have it, like, on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, when people actually tune in, yeah, we talk about that as well.
[00:06:25.997 --> 00:06:29.138]  I'm not cheerleading for the Democrats, nor am I cheerleading for the Republicans.
[00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:31.380]  I'm just calling it straight down the middle the best I can.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.483]  And people are calling it down the middle with Obama's latest State of the Union address, of course, that happened here recently.
[00:06:37.783 --> 00:06:43.206]  And we have a new article from Kit Daniels today, Obama's three biggest lies of the State of the Union address.
[00:06:43.766 --> 00:06:49.450]  Number one, Obama claims America has the strongest, most durable economy in the world.
[00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:57.094]  In direct contrast to reality, the president said anyone who points out America's economy is in a decline is peddling fiction.
[00:06:57.674 --> 00:06:59.014]  Now, think about this.
[00:06:59.054 --> 00:07:00.895]  We have a huge financial deficit.
[00:07:00.935 --> 00:07:03.475]  We continue to spend millions, if not billions of dollars.
[00:07:04.476 --> 00:07:05.116]  Whatever it is.
[00:07:05.536 --> 00:07:06.896]  Minutes, years, whatever.
[00:07:07.176 --> 00:07:07.516]  I don't know.
[00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:09.837]  You guys have seen all that ticker clock.
[00:07:10.417 --> 00:07:14.038]  But anyway, we spend a huge amount of money on our military industrial complex.
[00:07:14.118 --> 00:07:17.459]  We have a huge bubble in the educational market.
[00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:21.340]  A lot of people coming out of colleges and they can't find jobs.
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.520]  So, it leads to a whole big deal.
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.821]  I saw that movie recently, The Big Short.
[00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:29.343]  It talked about the financial and the housing market decline of 2008.
[00:07:29.463 --> 00:07:31.544]  It's a very interesting film.
[00:07:31.564 --> 00:07:33.545]  I'm not saying it's the most historically accurate.
[00:07:33.585 --> 00:07:35.146]  I'm not a big economic guy.
[00:07:35.506 --> 00:07:41.349]  But it shows you how easily things can be manipulated into a situation that's not good for the entire country.
[00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:42.650]  Because a lot of people, they feel safe.
[00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:43.910]  And they say, I don't own stocks.
[00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.051]  Or personally, I don't own stocks.
[00:07:45.371 --> 00:07:48.673]  But it affects much larger than just the people who own the stocks.
[00:07:48.713 --> 00:07:51.554]  Because, for example, they have the person in the movie.
[00:07:51.914 --> 00:07:53.255]  He's paying his rent to his
[00:07:55.256 --> 00:07:55.536]  I think so.
[00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:20.645]  Not to mention how we continue, and we meaning the CIA, continue to fund Al Qaeda.
[00:08:20.685 --> 00:08:24.007]  You know, it goes back to the Mujahideen with President Reagan.
[00:08:24.027 --> 00:08:26.148]  So it's nothing new under President Obama.
[00:08:26.429 --> 00:08:29.631]  But we arm our enemies and then send our guys out there to fight them.
[00:08:29.711 --> 00:08:34.474]  Just like we give firearms to Mexican drug cartels and then we tell the Border Patrol to fight them.
[00:08:34.754 --> 00:08:41.899]  And then when the Border Patrol agents end up dead, Obama goes to Mexico and says, the reason for all this gun violence in Mexico is because of American demand.
[00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:47.226]  It's like, no, it's because you're giving guns to guys like El Chapo in Sinaloa.
[00:08:47.426 --> 00:08:49.328]  They don't want to mention anything about that.
[00:08:50.049 --> 00:08:58.460]  And as Kit points out, in the real world, the White House and several other NATO nations, particularly Turkey, are arming and funding ISIS-linked militants.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.882]  And that is spot on.
[00:09:01.354 --> 00:09:05.959]  And also we have number three, Obama claims Obamacare helps create jobs.
[00:09:05.979 --> 00:09:06.760]  This is the kicker here.
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:13.046]  But the affordable insurance is too expensive for many companies to afford for their employees anyway.
[00:09:13.086 --> 00:09:18.312]  And as a result, many firms are now relying on part-time employees to avoid the Obamacare penalty.
[00:09:18.772 --> 00:09:29.497]  So, as well-intentioned as it may be in the reality of things, it's not really helping because you'll see in an article coming up a little bit later how many people are stuck working even after they retire.
[00:09:29.877 --> 00:09:31.198]  Now, let's talk about a big kicker.
[00:09:31.298 --> 00:09:34.319]  Obama says that he's done so much to help the veterans.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:42.643]  Under the Obama administration, we've seen multiple scandals, VA scandals, telling veterans they can't go to memorial parks and blocking them off and all that.
[00:09:42.944 --> 00:09:46.585]  Let's hear from Obama himself how much he has helped the American veteran.
[00:09:47.166 --> 00:09:47.986]  It's in that spirit.
[00:09:50.931 --> 00:09:53.193]  That we have made progress these past seven years.
[00:09:55.895 --> 00:09:59.037]  That's how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations.
[00:09:59.277 --> 00:10:09.905]  That's how we reformed our health care system and reinvented our energy sector.
[00:10:10.646 --> 00:10:16.190]  That's how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops coming home and our veterans.
[00:10:16.834 --> 00:10:25.079]  So there you go, the most transparent administration in history telling you how they help the veterans, even though, as we pointed out, VA scandals and all the rest of it.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.304]  The VA is trying to take away people's Second Amendment rights if they have, if they go to H&R Block and have somebody help them with their taxes.
[00:10:32.324 --> 00:10:35.306]  That shows you how much they are helping the American veterans.
[00:10:35.846 --> 00:10:37.327]  Iran releases 10 U.S.
[00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:40.750]  Navy sailors after boat drift drifted into Persian Gulf.
[00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.812]  Iran's Revolutionary Guard released 10 U.S.
[00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:51.538]  Navy sailors who were detained after two small ravine boats crossed into Iran territorial waters, the Pentagon confirmed on Wednesday.
[00:10:51.959 --> 00:10:59.224]  In a written statement, Secretary of State John Kerry thanked Iranian authorities for their cooperation in swiftly resolving this matter.
[00:11:00.365 --> 00:11:02.588]  That's good to see that the sailors were released.
[00:11:02.628 --> 00:11:06.513]  You know, hopefully we won't have any further hostilities on that front.
[00:11:06.913 --> 00:11:16.626]  Now, something that's very interesting to me, you know, I don't have any kids, but, you know, the big thing I hear from a lot of parents is I don't have a gun in my house because, you know, the kids may find it or whatever else.
[00:11:17.026 --> 00:11:17.646]  And I understand that.
[00:11:17.687 --> 00:11:19.948]  You know, if you choose to buy a gun safe, that's your business.
[00:11:19.988 --> 00:11:22.870]  If you choose to get a biometric firearm, that is also your business.
[00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:30.115]  But in the state of Oklahoma, where I'm from, we have an article how parents are suing the DHS over gun policy.
[00:11:30.495 --> 00:11:34.037]  It says two foster parents sued the Oklahoma Department of Human Services.
[00:11:34.097 --> 00:11:34.677]  That's their DHS.
[00:11:35.598 --> 00:11:41.505]  Because they say certain department rules for adopting kids violate their right to own guns for self-defense.
[00:11:42.046 --> 00:11:53.899]  According to the lawsuit, a couple wanting to adopt are required to sign a weapons safety agreement, which states in part that they are prohibited from possessing or carrying firearms in their vehicle,
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.442]  Or while their foster adopted children are present.
[00:11:57.923 --> 00:12:04.347]  So which is to say you cannot drive around with a gun in your vehicle, and also you cannot have one while your child is present.
[00:12:04.368 --> 00:12:06.029]  Well, the child's gonna be present in the house, right?
[00:12:06.049 --> 00:12:08.811]  So they're saying that you cannot have a firearm in the home.
[00:12:08.991 --> 00:12:11.153]  And this is just kind of, I guess you would say, backdoor.
[00:12:11.753 --> 00:12:28.125]  Gun confiscation because it's to a point in this country, regardless of what Obama says and all these other politicians, some politicians are much more overtly hardcore anti-Second Amendment rights than Obama is, but the issue is they don't want to go door to door and take your guns from you that way.
[00:12:28.145 --> 00:12:29.165]  They're too smart for that.
[00:12:29.446 --> 00:12:30.947]  So they come up with all these registrations.
[00:12:31.507 --> 00:12:32.128]  You can't have
[00:12:32.788 --> 00:12:44.013]  A firearm in your home if you adopt a child, or you can't have this many bullets in your magazine, or you have to buy a smart gun, or you have to have a safe, or you can't have a gun with X number of cosmetic features.
[00:12:44.033 --> 00:12:46.915]  So, are they going door-to-door and kicking in your door?
[00:12:47.135 --> 00:12:48.476]  Yes, they did in Hurricane Katrina.
[00:12:48.496 --> 00:12:49.796]  Do they want to do that nationwide?
[00:12:49.896 --> 00:12:50.937]  I'm pretty sure not.
[00:12:51.217 --> 00:12:57.560]  They'd have enough police and military who would rebel against that, but they're finding other ways to come after your Second Amendment rights, and it's completely ridiculous.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.341]  If something did happen to these kids,
[00:12:59.921 --> 00:13:04.286]  They say, you foster parents, you are not responsible adults for not protecting your children.
[00:13:04.307 --> 00:13:08.271]  Meanwhile, they're telling the foster parents that they cannot protect the children in the way that they see fit.
[00:13:08.812 --> 00:13:15.600]  And finally, before we go on to a special report from Leanne McAdoo, a record number of retired Americans are working part-time jobs.
[00:13:16.321 --> 00:13:17.582]  And this is from Zero Hedge.
[00:13:17.622 --> 00:13:28.589]  They said they reported on Friday that the surge in December job holders, a whopping 300,000 of these new jobs, were by multiple holders, as in one person working two or more jobs.
[00:13:28.869 --> 00:13:39.555]  Which means that when they say the big charts in the grass and X number of people are working now, yeah, there's people working two or three part-time jobs because they can't get a full-time job, in part because of Obamacare.
[00:13:39.575 --> 00:13:42.377]  It's not all Obamacare's fault, but it does have something to do with it.
[00:13:42.952 --> 00:13:45.413]  Now with this in mind, we're going to talk to Leanne McAdoo.
[00:13:45.433 --> 00:13:52.736]  She went out to the streets with her woman on the street and asked people, if you won this massive jackpot from the lottery, what would you do with your winnings?
[00:13:53.057 --> 00:13:54.177]  Here's a look at that report.
[00:14:04.442 --> 00:14:08.603]  Usually we do about $100, $150, but recently we've been doing about $800, $900 worth.
[00:14:08.704 --> 00:14:08.904]  A day?
[00:14:08.924 --> 00:14:08.984]  Yes.
[00:14:22.011 --> 00:14:24.033]  Leanne McAdoo for InfoWars.com.
[00:14:24.133 --> 00:14:28.196]  I am out here reporting on what is being called Powerball Mania.
[00:14:28.516 --> 00:14:33.260]  People have gone absolutely hysterical and driven up this prize.
[00:14:33.521 --> 00:14:36.243]  It's the highest prize in lottery history.
[00:14:36.263 --> 00:14:41.927]  1.5 billion dollars and as you can see this Powerball sign doesn't even go that high.
[00:14:42.388 --> 00:14:43.869]  People have a 1 in 280 million
[00:14:46.391 --> 00:14:47.531]  You're up in the odds!
[00:14:47.611 --> 00:14:48.292]  North Carolina.
[00:15:14.045 --> 00:15:16.608]  Tennessee and now in Texas.
[00:15:17.409 --> 00:15:21.374]  So now in North Carolina or Tennessee do you have to pay state taxes as well if you win?
[00:15:21.394 --> 00:15:23.837]  I don't know the answer to that at all.
[00:15:24.558 --> 00:15:25.019]  We'll share.
[00:15:25.039 --> 00:15:32.408]  So you don't mind that the real winner is going to be the federal, state, and local government?
[00:15:33.342 --> 00:15:38.166]  That's pretty sad, but yes, I've heard that, yes ma'am.
[00:15:38.206 --> 00:15:39.167]  Lottery or something.
[00:15:39.187 --> 00:15:40.849]  I heard someone talk about it up there.
[00:15:40.869 --> 00:15:46.093]  The chances of you winning it are like getting struck by lightning and... Five times.
[00:15:46.134 --> 00:15:46.454]  Yeah.
[00:15:46.474 --> 00:15:50.337]  I think you should still go for it.
[00:15:50.537 --> 00:15:51.058]  Yeah.
[00:15:51.258 --> 00:15:52.379]  If you're not in it, you won't win it.
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:57.604]  I have probably a better chance of making out with Tom Brady than I do winning the Powerball.
[00:15:58.305 --> 00:15:58.845]  This is true.
[00:15:58.885 --> 00:16:03.309]  You have a 1 in 272 million percent chance of winning.
[00:16:04.169 --> 00:16:04.670]  It's absurd.
[00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:09.253]  So, what would you do with your winnings, though, if you did play and you won?
[00:16:10.374 --> 00:16:11.195]  Make out with Tom Brady.
[00:16:12.736 --> 00:16:14.377]  You know who the winner is, though, right?
[00:16:15.478 --> 00:16:16.459]  They've already been announced.
[00:16:17.039 --> 00:16:17.299]  No.
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:18.580]  The government.
[00:16:19.261 --> 00:16:19.681]  Oh, yeah.
[00:16:20.262 --> 00:16:22.884]  Are you okay with that, that they take at least 40%?
[00:16:22.944 --> 00:16:26.707]  Here in Texas it's only 40% because we don't pay state taxes, but in other places it's
[00:16:27.874 --> 00:16:29.915]  68%.
[00:16:28.054 --> 00:16:29.915]  Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[00:16:29.955 --> 00:16:31.016]  It's still more than you had.
[00:16:31.036 --> 00:16:33.037]  And that's the way life works here.
[00:16:33.057 --> 00:16:34.118]  I don't want that much money.
[00:16:34.779 --> 00:16:35.279]  Really?
[00:16:35.379 --> 00:16:35.539]  Why?
[00:16:35.579 --> 00:16:36.660]  You've heard too much horror stories?
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.780]  I'm the soul of a gremlin.
[00:16:39.141 --> 00:16:39.742]  How's that?
[00:16:39.842 --> 00:16:41.123]  I would do so much mischief with it.
[00:16:41.243 --> 00:16:41.963]  Oh my god.
[00:16:42.103 --> 00:16:44.285]  The one guy said he was gonna get hookers and blow.
[00:16:46.226 --> 00:16:46.546]  No.
[00:16:47.126 --> 00:16:48.968]  No!
[00:16:49.028 --> 00:16:51.789]  That video went viral!
[00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.171]  What would you do if you won the Powerball?
[00:16:55.098 --> 00:16:57.039]  Oh man, I couldn't imagine.
[00:16:57.139 --> 00:17:02.120]  I would invest a lot of investments and party.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:02.800]  Yeah.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:03.580]  Party.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:09.742]  I'm sure if I won the Powerball, there'd be people up in the line with their hands out wanting to take it one way or the other.
[00:17:09.762 --> 00:17:15.543]  Either way, if I had $10 million of that, I'd be happy enough.
[00:17:16.323 --> 00:17:18.444]  So you're not worried about the Powerball curse though?
[00:17:19.264 --> 00:17:19.504]  No.
[00:17:20.024 --> 00:17:23.825]  What do you think about those people that they like win all this money and then their lives are ruined?
[00:17:24.893 --> 00:17:25.794]  I think they're idiots.
[00:17:28.596 --> 00:17:30.457]  Yeah, I mean really, they're just idiots.
[00:17:32.599 --> 00:17:38.404]  They should have given some of it away and, you know, if you fly too close to the sun you get burnt, man.
[00:17:39.384 --> 00:17:39.925]  What can I say?
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.921]  This is a protest.
[00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:02.481]  And this is a riot.
[00:18:02.842 --> 00:18:06.663]  If you can't tell the difference, then you are part of the problem.
[00:18:07.063 --> 00:18:09.004]  Infowars.com.
[00:18:16.586 --> 00:18:18.787]  Another GOP debate is upon us.
[00:18:19.488 --> 00:18:26.172]  When you had the World Trade Center go, people were put into planes that were friends, family, and they were sent back.
[00:18:26.452 --> 00:18:27.473]  They knew what was going on.
[00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:31.135]  They went home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television.
[00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:35.598]  Who else would come back like that at the Bushes and the Clintons calling them criminals?
[00:18:35.778 --> 00:18:36.439]  And the Saudis.
[00:18:36.659 --> 00:18:37.740]  Guys, go back to your live feeds.
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.241]  You see, we don't have rights in America.
[00:18:40.781 --> 00:18:43.103]  Only the people who are outside of this country have a right.
[00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:46.205]  The only right that anybody has is to come live in America.
[00:18:46.505 --> 00:18:48.987]  Presumably to live off of us if that's what they choose.
[00:18:49.288 --> 00:18:50.389]  They can come live off of us.
[00:18:50.409 --> 00:18:52.531]  They can come create war in our country.
[00:18:52.751 --> 00:18:53.392]  That's their right.
[00:18:53.832 --> 00:18:55.574]  But people in America don't have rights.
[00:18:55.674 --> 00:19:00.639]  The first and most important priority of the President of the United States is to protect the safety and security of America.
[00:19:00.719 --> 00:19:01.400]  No it isn't.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.641]  You're disqualified.
[00:19:02.961 --> 00:19:10.388]  You have an oath to the Constitution and the oath to the Constitution says, and the Declaration of Independence says, you are created to protect our freedoms.
[00:19:10.769 --> 00:19:11.029]  Right.
[00:19:11.329 --> 00:19:12.670]  Not to keep us safe!
[00:19:13.091 --> 00:19:14.032]  They didn't want safety.
[00:19:14.052 --> 00:19:18.716]  They wouldn't have rebelled against the strongest government in the world if their first priority was safety.
[00:19:18.756 --> 00:19:19.917]  Their first priority was liberty.
[00:19:20.258 --> 00:19:21.759]  They created a government to protect that.
[00:19:21.899 --> 00:19:22.900]  I'm sick of these people.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.383]  If we want to defend the country, we have to defend against those who are coming in.
[00:19:26.423 --> 00:19:32.489]  And Marco has more of an allegiance to Chuck Schumer and to the liberals than he does to conservative policy.
[00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:36.273]  Do you really think that Republicans have fueled the rise of ISIS?
[00:19:37.839 --> 00:19:38.479]  Uh, yeah.
[00:19:38.579 --> 00:19:39.220]  Where's she been?
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.241]  Who is she?
[00:19:41.421 --> 00:19:43.602]  Where is she?
[00:19:43.622 --> 00:19:46.123]  What's she been doing?
[00:19:46.243 --> 00:19:47.204]  This is Fimbo.
[00:19:47.584 --> 00:19:48.724]  We know what's going on.
[00:19:48.784 --> 00:19:50.445]  We know these guys are running ISIS.
[00:19:50.765 --> 00:19:55.208]  And when they talk about shutting down freedom of speech, he just repeated the exact same stuff he said in his speech.
[00:19:55.368 --> 00:20:00.150]  Even talking about how you don't refer to these people as masterminds, he knows precisely what he's saying.
[00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:04.415]  These are a bunch of Morlocks, and the American people are a bunch of Eloy.
[00:20:04.515 --> 00:20:07.419]  When they talk about serving America, you're on the menu.
[00:20:19.655 --> 00:20:29.061]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:20:29.401 --> 00:20:31.962]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:20:32.102 --> 00:20:35.424]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:20:35.645 --> 00:20:41.668]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[00:20:41.988 --> 00:20:44.510]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down.
[00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:44.870]  I'm good.
[00:21:01.221 --> 00:21:08.509]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:12.273]  Obtain your ChildEase today at Infowarslife.com.
[00:21:12.374 --> 00:21:15.337]  That's ChildEase exclusively at Infowarslife.com.
[00:21:16.218 --> 00:21:17.399]  Knockout is back!
[00:21:17.719 --> 00:21:22.084]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients,
[00:21:22.805 --> 00:21:27.886]  That naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep, restful sleep.
[00:21:28.046 --> 00:21:28.786]  Knockout sit.
[00:21:29.207 --> 00:21:30.887]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:21:31.427 --> 00:21:40.509]  L-theanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:21:40.929 --> 00:21:42.690]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:47.651]  It's the same price as leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece.
[00:21:48.131 --> 00:21:50.692]  It has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult.
[00:21:51.292 --> 00:21:57.534]  It's got the GABA, so it would probably cost $50 to take all this as separate pills.
[00:21:58.014 --> 00:21:58.154]  It's $19.95.
[00:21:58.874 --> 00:22:05.597]  You take one or two of these, and it just is really clean, restful sleep is what the reviews are.
[00:22:05.937 --> 00:22:09.818]  It's what I've experienced, and it just synergistically puts everything in there.
[00:22:09.838 --> 00:22:11.118]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:22:11.158 --> 00:22:13.499]  That's Infowarslife.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[00:22:19.656 --> 00:22:27.324]  We need to audit the private run for private Federal Reserve, and no one has championed that more than former Congressman Dr. Ron Paul.
[00:22:27.404 --> 00:22:32.729]  And now, for the last five years, no one has championed that more in the U.S.
[00:22:32.829 --> 00:22:34.871]  Senate than Senator Rand Paul.
[00:22:35.392 --> 00:22:40.036]  And that's why I've been very hopeful when he was the leader of the campaign, of the Republican run.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.241]  To get the nomination, that he would stay in the lead.
[00:22:43.281 --> 00:22:45.181]  But he's been in the lead, he could go back in the lead.
[00:22:45.461 --> 00:22:46.161]  We've seen that.
[00:22:46.521 --> 00:22:55.764]  The media's trying to say that Rand Paul is out of the race, and then they put John Kasich in the Republican debate coming up tomorrow night that we're going to be covering live.
[00:22:55.824 --> 00:22:56.544]  It's crazy!
[00:22:58.245 --> 00:23:01.626]  So, definitely the fix is in, but can we override that fix?
[00:23:01.646 --> 00:23:02.886]  I know he didn't come on about this.
[00:23:03.146 --> 00:23:06.327]  He wanted to come on about auditing the Fed, which we're very close to doing.
[00:23:08.325 --> 00:23:10.567]  Really, it's 1776 Part 2, but peaceful.
[00:23:11.307 --> 00:23:13.789]  But I do want to get into campaign 2016 with him.
[00:23:14.069 --> 00:23:15.150]  RandPaul.com.
[00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:17.391]  Senator, thanks for coming on with us again.
[00:23:18.472 --> 00:23:18.912]  Hey, Alex.
[00:23:19.012 --> 00:23:19.593]  Thanks for having us.
[00:23:20.233 --> 00:23:21.434]  There is so much going on.
[00:23:21.454 --> 00:23:23.616]  We've only got you for about 10 minutes, so you've got the floor.
[00:23:24.176 --> 00:23:25.657]  What's the battle plan to audit the Fed?
[00:23:25.697 --> 00:23:26.958]  What's happening in the campaign?
[00:23:27.538 --> 00:23:28.939]  How do we get you back in the debates?
[00:23:28.959 --> 00:23:29.800]  Where is all this going?
[00:23:30.819 --> 00:23:33.281]  The good news is, you know, we got a majority yesterday.
[00:23:33.321 --> 00:23:38.386]  We got 53 votes for auditing the Fed, and we needed 60, unfortunately.
[00:23:38.426 --> 00:23:40.687]  We were missing Ted Cruz, unfortunately.
[00:23:40.707 --> 00:23:42.229]  He couldn't come back to vote with us.
[00:23:42.709 --> 00:23:45.692]  But we did get a majority, and I think that's a step forward.
[00:23:45.712 --> 00:23:47.894]  It took me five years to get a vote on the bill.
[00:23:48.694 --> 00:23:50.956]  I talked to Harry Reid until I was blue in the face.
[00:23:51.036 --> 00:23:55.440]  I reminded him that he used to be for auditing the Fed, but no longer.
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.121]  And we finally got a vote.
[00:23:58.302 --> 00:24:02.423]  Two Democrats, Baldwin, and then we got Bernie Sanders to vote for it as well.
[00:24:03.063 --> 00:24:05.843]  So, we got close, but we didn't quite get there.
[00:24:05.883 --> 00:24:07.544]  But to me, it's a long fight.
[00:24:07.684 --> 00:24:08.744]  It's long overdue.
[00:24:09.304 --> 00:24:13.965]  The Federal Reserve really is responsible for a lot of the income inequality in our country.
[00:24:14.305 --> 00:24:17.825]  The rich get richer because the Federal Reserve passes their money out to the rich.
[00:24:18.306 --> 00:24:26.227]  By the time it filters down to the rest of us, prices are going up and we never really seem to see any value in the new money that is put into the system.
[00:24:27.978 --> 00:24:30.820]  I also notice mainstream media really tries to not cover this.
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:37.643]  This is a big deal when you have the former Fed Chairman Greenspan, as you know, on Laird NewsHour saying, we're above the law, Congress can't even look at us.
[00:24:38.104 --> 00:24:44.487]  Since when is a private group masquerading as government above the law when Congress has the power to issue the currency, Senator?
[00:24:44.507 --> 00:24:46.949]  Because, I mean, I cannot praise you and others enough.
[00:24:47.589 --> 00:24:56.806]  Especially you for leading the fight all the way to the fact that you've almost been able to overturn it, but they want this, I guess, 60 votes, but you've gotten 50-plus.
[00:24:56.846 --> 00:25:00.552]  I mean, this is amazing after your father's 30-plus year battle to do this.
[00:25:02.011 --> 00:25:11.034]  The biggest lobby against auditing the Fed is actually coming from the Federal Reserve, and this has made me so mad that the government created the Federal Reserve.
[00:25:11.094 --> 00:25:14.516]  Sure, they're quasi-private, but they were created by the government.
[00:25:14.856 --> 00:25:21.218]  It's a conglomeration of private banks, but they should not be allowed to lobby against their own oversight.
[00:25:21.578 --> 00:25:26.660]  So they come to Washington, they write op-eds, they called every senator in advance.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.923]  And lobbied them to say, we don't want more oversight.
[00:25:30.963 --> 00:25:34.025]  It'll somehow, you know, affect our policymaking.
[00:25:34.465 --> 00:25:36.446]  Well, we need to ask questions.
[00:25:36.526 --> 00:25:44.151]  Did their policymaking lead to this huge, enormous recession that we got with a real estate crisis and where a lot of people caught up in it?
[00:25:44.611 --> 00:25:51.596]  And how come when we got caught up in it, the poor people suffered, but the people on Wall Street just went right along merrily making $100 million a year?
[00:25:53.517 --> 00:25:55.259]  And they bankrupted AIG.
[00:25:55.599 --> 00:25:59.182]  You saw the other day who the former head of AIG is giving their money to, right?
[00:25:59.602 --> 00:26:03.685]  He took $10 million of his bailout money to try to bail out the Bush campaign.
[00:26:04.126 --> 00:26:05.447]  So it goes on and on.
[00:26:05.507 --> 00:26:13.093]  The rich get richer, but the government should not be showing this crony capitalism through the banking system.
[00:26:13.553 --> 00:26:14.874]  And I'm going to keep up the fight.
[00:26:14.935 --> 00:26:18.477]  If it takes me another five years, I'm going to get a vote on Audit the Fed and we're going to win.
[00:26:19.598 --> 00:26:33.848]  Well, I have said probably a thousand times the last few years that even before the campaign started, I appreciate you running for president, just like I appreciate you running for Senate, and I appreciate the fact that you've been true to your principles and not compromised, even though they've demonized you.
[00:26:33.888 --> 00:26:39.772]  But now, I have not been critical, but I mean, I know you're a gentleman, your dad's a gentleman.
[00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:46.430]  The fact is, people are angry, there's an insurrection, a lot of America isn't as sophisticated as some of the libertarians.
[00:26:47.972 --> 00:26:50.597]  I think you can beat Trump if you
[00:26:52.071 --> 00:26:53.152]  Really get aggressive.
[00:26:53.912 --> 00:27:01.798]  And I'm not saying stoop to that level, but of the WWE, which obviously he's been part of, but he knows what he's doing.
[00:27:02.058 --> 00:27:03.159]  That's what people want.
[00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:06.881]  And all I'm saying is, I know you'd make the best president of the three people.
[00:27:06.901 --> 00:27:08.282]  I mean, I like Ted Cruz.
[00:27:08.622 --> 00:27:09.583]  I like Trump as well.
[00:27:09.903 --> 00:27:12.285]  I know your pedigree, your history, no compromise.
[00:27:12.565 --> 00:27:13.786]  You're for real.
[00:27:13.846 --> 00:27:16.688]  Trump, I don't really know, but I mean, I'd rather him than Hillary.
[00:27:17.328 --> 00:27:19.271]  How do we get you elected president?
[00:27:19.291 --> 00:27:26.079]  I know there's a lot of time left, and folks thought Trump would fade, but I think, you know, really getting aggressive is the way to go.
[00:27:26.119 --> 00:27:30.645]  I don't plan to be the big political guru here, sir, but, I mean, I'd really like to see you as president.
[00:27:31.943 --> 00:27:40.649]  You know, the thing we keep trying to point out is that Trump has no history as a person who believes in limited government or as really even being a conservative.
[00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:47.433]  One of the things that I think is the bedrock principle of capitalism and a free society is ownership of property.
[00:27:47.473 --> 00:27:49.995]  When you own your house, the government shouldn't come in your house.
[00:27:50.355 --> 00:27:54.498]  The government has no right to your property and you have the right to control your property.
[00:27:55.058 --> 00:28:01.005]  But you know, one of the ways Trump has made money, and he's said this repeatedly, is that he believes in eminent domain.
[00:28:01.045 --> 00:28:06.071]  He believes the government should be allowed to take private property and give it to another private property owner.
[00:28:06.091 --> 00:28:13.560]  This was a famous Supreme Court decision, the Kelo decision, and I think it's inconsistent with someone who believes in limited government.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.561]  We're good to go.
[00:28:33.694 --> 00:28:35.755]  You know, I'll be strong, I'll do things better.
[00:28:35.775 --> 00:28:48.983]  I worry about that because most of the tradition, not only English tradition, but American tradition, has been trying to limit the power of the monarch, limit the power of the presidency, and it's not give me more power, I'm smart and I'll fix it.
[00:28:49.403 --> 00:28:52.505]  It's leave the power with the states and the people and leave me alone.
[00:28:52.525 --> 00:28:54.807]  And I don't think he's part of that tradition.
[00:28:54.827 --> 00:29:02.131]  But he is angry and people have, you know, fallen in for the anger without examining whether or not he would make government bigger or smaller.
[00:29:02.832 --> 00:29:05.621]  Well, I know you have so much integrity that you won't...
[00:29:06.514 --> 00:29:10.116]  Get, you know, professional wrestler on folks to win.
[00:29:10.136 --> 00:29:12.918]  But at the same time, I know you have integrity.
[00:29:12.938 --> 00:29:13.738]  I mean, I've watched you.
[00:29:13.778 --> 00:29:16.160]  I've known you for 20 years when you were campaigning for your dad.
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.641]  And I know you've never compromised.
[00:29:18.721 --> 00:29:24.245]  I know you exposed that Al Qaeda was being Western funded before Cruz or Trump did it, you know, years before.
[00:29:24.705 --> 00:29:34.551]  I know you've led the fight on the Fed, led the fight to defund, you know, all these different organizations like Planned Parenthood and, you know, defund the foreign aid of these radical Islamists.
[00:29:34.591 --> 00:29:35.632]  I mean, I know, sir, that
[00:29:36.252 --> 00:29:36.633]  You know what?
[00:29:53.854 --> 00:29:55.256]  You're doing a great job overall.
[00:29:55.276 --> 00:30:04.768]  I just wonder, sitting here, how we can catapult you back to the lead when clearly the establishment is doing everything they can to try to sideline you.
[00:30:04.809 --> 00:30:07.873]  I mean, look, you clearly have more support than John Kasich.
[00:30:08.193 --> 00:30:09.455]  Clearly you should be in the debate.
[00:30:09.875 --> 00:30:15.081]  So you're probably doing the right thing to not be in the debate so that you can at least make a big deal out of it and actually be heard.
[00:30:15.461 --> 00:30:23.130]  What else can you do, can we do, to try to get you back in there to win this nomination or to inject good ideas?
[00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:27.775]  Because, you know, Trump could do some faux pas, fall out, and then we get Jeb Bush, God forbid.
[00:30:28.749 --> 00:30:50.975]  You know, I think one of the things about the disconnect between the grassroots and, you know, the establishment Washington Republicans is, I put forward an amendment about a year or so ago and I said that we shouldn't give any foreign aid to any countries that persecute Christians, any countries that put to death Christians who interfaith marriage or people who convert from Islam to Christianity.
[00:30:51.695 --> 00:30:55.676]  If they have laws on their books that says you are put to death, they shouldn't get any of our money.
[00:30:56.096 --> 00:31:01.800]  I've yet to meet one American outside of Washington who is opposed to my amendment.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:11.906]  And yet in Washington, when we voted on it, 18 senators voted to continue sending foreign aid, even if the laws of the country we were giving the money to were to persecute Christians.
[00:31:12.487 --> 00:31:17.750]  And so that, I think, just shows you how far apart we are, the grassroots from those in Washington.
[00:31:20.168 --> 00:31:23.672]  The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel.
[00:31:23.732 --> 00:31:27.135]  The Fed is a sometimes very independent organization.
[00:31:27.195 --> 00:31:32.020]  What should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.743]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency.
[00:31:35.043 --> 00:31:39.308]  There is no other agency of government which can overrule.
[00:31:39.768 --> 00:31:46.035]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else
[00:31:57.455 --> 00:32:06.281]  ...is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[00:32:06.321 --> 00:32:11.445]  Jeff Duncan says he saw IRS special agents using semi-automatic rifles at a gun range.
[00:32:11.965 --> 00:32:15.548]  Now he wants answers to why the agency needs that type of firepower.
[00:32:15.728 --> 00:32:17.769]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:32:17.849 --> 00:32:20.251]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[00:32:20.311 --> 00:32:22.692]  Know your history and you will know your enemy.
[00:32:23.033 --> 00:32:24.133]  InfoWars.com
[00:32:26.411 --> 00:32:32.095]  Shane Steiner's involvement with InfoWarsLife.com truly happened in an organic way.
[00:32:32.235 --> 00:32:34.956]  I went to high school with Shane, his brother, knew his parents well.
[00:32:35.176 --> 00:32:40.840]  And he was visiting the office once, hadn't been to the office in years, and said, wow, I notice you're making and selling supplements.
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:41.620]  Do these really work?
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:46.723]  Because I've tried a lot of supplements as a workout enthusiast, and I really think most of them are hype.
[00:32:46.843 --> 00:32:48.243]  I said, here, take some home, try it.
[00:32:48.343 --> 00:32:54.905]  Well, a few weeks later, he came in, blown away, and said, I want to buy three boxes of this stuff to give my friends and family.
[00:32:55.305 --> 00:32:56.825]  It's simply amazing.
[00:32:56.865 --> 00:32:58.125]  He said, why does it work so well?
[00:32:58.185 --> 00:33:02.706]  And I said, listen, go to Infowarslife.com, watch the informational videos with Dr. Group and others.
[00:33:02.927 --> 00:33:04.427]  They understand how it all works.
[00:33:04.707 --> 00:33:06.267]  I know that it works for me.
[00:33:06.407 --> 00:33:07.548]  That's all I understand.
[00:33:07.788 --> 00:33:12.849]  The science, the facts, the research, people's testimonials, they're all on Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:12.869 --> 00:33:13.829]  You can check it out for yourself.
[00:33:14.449 --> 00:33:15.550]  I wanted to go to the gym.
[00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:25.636]  I wanted to push myself and work out harder, and that led to me being able to come out and do stuff like the barefooting and the surfing and stuff like that, which I would have never done.
[00:33:25.656 --> 00:33:28.198]  I never would have done that two years ago.
[00:33:28.778 --> 00:33:32.421]  Shane has said over and over again, more than just libido and energy,
[00:33:32.961 --> 00:33:34.722]  It made him want to get into the gym more.
[00:33:35.062 --> 00:33:36.523]  It made him want to get in better shape.
[00:33:36.563 --> 00:33:39.184]  And believe me, the Steiners have amazing genetics.
[00:33:39.745 --> 00:33:42.166]  His brother is a world champion steer wrestler.
[00:33:42.506 --> 00:33:46.488]  His dad, Bobby Steiner, is a famous world champion bull rider.
[00:33:46.688 --> 00:33:48.349]  They've got natural genetics.
[00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:53.512]  But when you added this to the mix, in Shane's own words, it took him to the next level.
[00:34:05.825 --> 00:34:07.526]  Shane noticed the mental clarity.
[00:34:07.987 --> 00:34:11.469]  Bobby was able to work out longer and gain muscle mass.
[00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:12.890]  He's already completely shredded.
[00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:15.752]  I gotta admit, for me, the biggest effect has been libido.
[00:34:16.112 --> 00:34:22.156]  Now, I've never claimed to have a body like some beach model, but back when I was 20, 22 years old and worked out every day, I looked great.
[00:34:22.196 --> 00:34:28.221]  But over the years, being married, having three kids, working 18 hours a day, I gained basically 100 pounds.
[00:34:28.361 --> 00:34:31.483]  And it's been a long process of losing that weight in the last four years.
[00:34:31.663 --> 00:34:34.245]  But if you look at the photos and the videos,
[00:34:34.505 --> 00:34:34.846]  I don't know.
[00:34:53.670 --> 00:35:03.734]  This has actually made me feel so good that here lately, about a year ago, I started training jiu-jitsu and that kind of led to doing some boxing and kickboxing.
[00:35:03.754 --> 00:35:16.260]  I mean, it's amazing that two years ago I was on the couch and couldn't even tie my shoes and now I'm training with MMA fighters and just doing stuff that I never thought that I would be doing ever again.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.361]  So, Supermail Vitality has
[00:35:19.261 --> 00:35:19.783]  I don't know.
[00:35:29.554 --> 00:35:29.994]  You'll love it.
[00:36:13.923 --> 00:36:23.228]  Bottom line folks, you want to discover the power of super male vitality and super female vitality for yourself by visiting InfoWarsLife.com today or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:37.657 --> 00:36:40.378]  Jakari Jackson reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:36:40.478 --> 00:36:42.458]  Today we are in the city of Austin, Texas.
[00:36:42.838 --> 00:36:45.619]  We're on our way to see printable gun pioneer Cody Wilson.
[00:36:46.039 --> 00:36:53.541]  Now you guys may recall, Cody, he made headlines many years ago for his production of the Liberator, the first 3D printed pistol.
[00:36:53.842 --> 00:37:00.743]  Since then, his technology has advanced and he actually has a shop that we're going to see where he assembles what is known as the Ghost Gunner.
[00:37:01.184 --> 00:37:05.265]  It's a mill that allows you to make, among many other things, a lower receiver for AR-15.
[00:37:06.465 --> 00:37:13.028]  So we're going to go check out his shop and see what he thinks about the recent reasonable gun control proposals made by the President.
[00:37:13.808 --> 00:37:19.310]  Okay, so we're here with Cody Wilson and he's going to walk us through Defense Distributed and show us how he fabricates the Ghost Gunner.
[00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:19.710]  Cody?
[00:37:20.311 --> 00:37:20.731]  Hitch a car.
[00:37:21.151 --> 00:37:21.331]  Yes.
[00:37:21.491 --> 00:37:22.912]  Alright, you're in the shop, small shop.
[00:37:23.272 --> 00:37:23.932]  Let's come to the back.
[00:37:24.853 --> 00:37:25.613]  Assembly line model.
[00:37:27.901 --> 00:37:29.523]  As long as you're happy with the machine looking like this.
[00:37:30.043 --> 00:37:31.424]  Okay, that's what it looks like.
[00:37:31.505 --> 00:37:32.105]  That's what we make.
[00:37:32.145 --> 00:37:33.126]  There's no variation.
[00:37:33.206 --> 00:37:33.907]  Everything's the same.
[00:37:33.947 --> 00:37:37.130]  It's the Model T of personal assault weapon fabrication.
[00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:39.692]  We start with an empty shell over here.
[00:37:39.993 --> 00:37:43.916]  Machine proceeds around the assembly line in a U. Comes back down through here.
[00:37:45.143 --> 00:38:00.175]  Makes a lot of, takes a lot of sub-assemblies from the back which are inserted as it goes, gets fitted out with electronics, power supply, we do a little bit of setup code testing, comes off the line, goes out the back door to your house.
[00:38:00.655 --> 00:38:02.317]  So what exactly does the Ghost Gunner do?
[00:38:03.852 --> 00:38:09.600]  The Ghost Gunner is in actuality just a mill, just a very tiny computer controlled mill.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:16.169]  A computer tells a moving end mill in space where to go, how to carve out a piece of aluminum that you can kind of bolt down to a work surface.
[00:38:18.007 --> 00:38:19.327]  Previous century technology.
[00:38:19.947 --> 00:38:23.348]  There is nothing in it, of it, that it is itself revolutionary.
[00:38:23.748 --> 00:38:25.329]  But when you ask me, what does a ghost gunner do?
[00:38:25.849 --> 00:38:27.109]  I don't really think about the milling.
[00:38:27.189 --> 00:38:29.349]  I think about what it does to the liberal imagination.
[00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:33.130]  What it does to the elitist gun control imaginary.
[00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:33.890]  It destroys it.
[00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:35.391]  That's what the ghost gunner really does.
[00:38:35.711 --> 00:38:41.652]  And now secretly, in garages in a neighborhood near you, someone may, or may not be, manufacturing an AR-15 in their garage.
[00:38:42.412 --> 00:38:48.033]  The Ghost Gunner has a price tag of $1,500 and sports a very long waiting list.
[00:38:48.693 --> 00:38:58.695]  Cody's machine has the ability to take a hunk of billet aluminum, known as an 80% lower receiver, and mill it into a principal part of an AR-15 rifle.
[00:38:59.255 --> 00:39:02.736]  But as one might expect, not all politicians are on board.
[00:39:03.176 --> 00:39:09.117]  This, again, is the engine to the high-powered and semi-automatic assault weapons that you see displayed here today.
[00:39:10.037 --> 00:39:10.517]  With that,
[00:39:11.345 --> 00:39:14.427]  You are a self-proclaimed anarchist, correct?
[00:39:14.447 --> 00:39:16.388]  Yeah, look, I'm anti-state now.
[00:39:16.408 --> 00:39:16.708]  All the way.
[00:39:16.728 --> 00:39:21.271]  Does your philosophy further your technology or your drive for technology?
[00:39:38.803 --> 00:39:40.604]  My technology furthers my philosophy.
[00:39:41.325 --> 00:39:43.726]  I'm not sure if the philosophy is furthering the technology that much.
[00:39:43.766 --> 00:39:50.431]  I mean, our insight is that change is tool-based and can be technically based.
[00:39:51.492 --> 00:39:54.614]  But I hope that I don't lapse into a certain kind of arrogant technicism.
[00:39:55.094 --> 00:40:02.279]  In 2016, President Obama made headlines by outlining plans for biometric GPS-tracked firearms.
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:06.402]  We need to develop new technologies that make guns safer.
[00:40:07.338 --> 00:40:17.779]  If we can set it up so you can't unlock your phone unless you got the right fingerprint, why can't we do the same thing for our guns?
[00:40:21.355 --> 00:40:24.777]  Do you have any plans to make a fingerprint scanner for Ghost Gunner?
[00:40:25.537 --> 00:40:26.537]  Not at all, GK.
[00:40:26.637 --> 00:40:28.538]  I want every Ghost Gunner to look like it's brother.
[00:40:29.159 --> 00:40:34.661]  I want to take as little information as legally necessary to manufacture, to ship.
[00:40:35.201 --> 00:40:38.003]  The capital stock of guns in this country will never be converted.
[00:40:38.863 --> 00:40:43.826]  Well let me ask you, how long until a product that comes out of a ghost gunner is military grade technology?
[00:41:06.735 --> 00:41:10.118]  Look, I'll answer the question that it's military grade now.
[00:41:11.439 --> 00:41:16.102]  Commercial lower receivers for AR-15s are machined aluminum, often billet aluminum.
[00:41:16.503 --> 00:41:18.644]  You're getting the exact same product off of the Ghost Gunner.
[00:41:19.245 --> 00:41:25.510]  Two military specifications, because we base our fixturing and our software around the military spec of the AR-15 lower.
[00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:30.814]  So you're getting functionally, materially identical components to the military component.
[00:41:32.282 --> 00:41:33.382]  Now, Kelly, you went to UT.
[00:41:33.422 --> 00:41:35.803]  Did you study engineering, or what did you study there?
[00:41:36.163 --> 00:41:38.144]  No, man, I studied law at UT.
[00:41:38.204 --> 00:41:54.208]  A lot of the guys in this shop don't come from engineering backgrounds, per se, but we think that the computer revolution, the digital revolution, they impart certain abilities, or the ability to educate yourself in a way that formal education tricks you into thinking that you can't be educated.
[00:41:54.348 --> 00:42:01.050]  So everybody that came into this shop didn't necessarily have a hands-on, machine-type shop background, but they've got it now.
[00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:11.201]  Before the Ghost Gunner, Cody first shot to fame with the production of the Liberator, a crude single-shot 3D printable gun.
[00:42:11.502 --> 00:42:15.526]  He used his skills and equipment to print things such as magazines as well.
[00:42:15.927 --> 00:42:21.634]  So consider this, a CAD file containing the information for a 3D printable weapon system.
[00:42:23.188 --> 00:42:23.928]  This machine did a...
[00:42:45.054 --> 00:42:48.117]  All the principal liberator components for the liberator trials back in early 2013.
[00:42:48.417 --> 00:42:52.541]  It's an old 2003 Stratasys SST machine.
[00:42:53.121 --> 00:42:56.104]  I'm involved in a large lawsuit against the U.S.
[00:42:56.124 --> 00:43:01.008]  State Department that's now in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and that is fighting them over their
[00:43:01.849 --> 00:43:08.197]  They're a total blanket ban on my posting of our work here, our research, our R&D efforts to the internet.
[00:43:08.617 --> 00:43:10.460]  They've literally targeted no one else in history.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.924]  You can go to the Air 15 forums, you can go to any kind of catapultory you want.
[00:43:13.964 --> 00:43:15.946]  The gun files are all over the internet and have been for years.
[00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:18.149]  DOJ got back to Congress after...
[00:43:19.875 --> 00:43:21.556]  With this you're printing the lower receivers, correct?
[00:43:21.576 --> 00:43:24.237]  But for a 1911, how fully functional would a 1911 be coming out of a machine like this?
[00:43:45.606 --> 00:43:50.345]  In the very same way that we're not producing the entire AR-15 on this machine, you're producing, like, the receiver.
[00:43:51.833 --> 00:43:58.278]  In the 1911, there's a frame component that can be milled out of aluminum, which is also sometimes considered to be the regulated component.
[00:43:58.558 --> 00:44:04.983]  So we're talking about creating the regulated components of guns as much as we're talking about being able to meaningfully manufacture them.
[00:44:05.424 --> 00:44:14.611]  So if I can make my own AR-15 receiver, I sidestep the entire FFL registration serialization network, and I can assemble my own private AR-15.
[00:44:15.111 --> 00:44:17.913]  But I don't make every single component of that AR-15 on this machine.
[00:44:17.933 --> 00:44:21.396]  I want to read you this quote from Kalashnikov, of course, the maker of the AK-47.
[00:44:22.236 --> 00:44:26.660]  I didn't want to design a weapon that was going to be used in widespread fratricidal war.
[00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:29.422]  I only wanted to help protect my country's borders.
[00:44:30.162 --> 00:44:33.425]  Now, the Ghost Gunner, the Liberator, all this stuff is in its infancy.
[00:44:33.745 --> 00:44:39.969]  Let's say the technology advances and becomes more widespread, there are more than a few bodies attributed to the technology.
[00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:44.853]  Do you foresee a day when Cody Wilson will share a sentiment similar to Kalashnikov?
[00:44:46.107 --> 00:44:47.848]  I share Kalashnikov's sentiment now.
[00:44:48.909 --> 00:44:54.233]  The rest of his sentiment was that he said, don't blame me for this technology and its use.
[00:44:54.413 --> 00:44:55.234]  Blame the politicians.
[00:44:55.614 --> 00:45:01.538]  Blame the nation-states and these large protracted wars, which are really the consequence of the behavior between states, as states.
[00:45:01.819 --> 00:45:02.939]  I have nothing to do with that.
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:06.002]  Whenever these people get on TV and point the finger at the hobbyists,
[00:45:07.031 --> 00:45:17.781]  They fail to mention how many AR-15s they themselves are shipping to Mexico, to Al-Nusra, through Turkey with CIA operations and, you know, all over these theaters of war in the Middle East.
[00:45:18.121 --> 00:45:20.423]  I have nothing to do with that, now or will I ever.
[00:45:21.464 --> 00:45:23.906]  Obama cries for first graders in Connecticut.
[00:45:24.727 --> 00:45:29.431]  Does he cry for the first graders in any other country to which he's shipped these assault rifles?
[00:45:30.171 --> 00:45:30.552]  Himself?
[00:45:31.192 --> 00:45:31.873]  I didn't send them there.
[00:45:32.393 --> 00:45:32.954]  How'd they get there?
[00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:55.643]  You know, with all this talk lately about gun control, it occurred to me that I've yet to see a single politician who can explain to me how they plan to take guns away from the criminal thugs who are out there on the streets right now.
[00:45:56.304 --> 00:46:02.749]  Oh sure, you'll hear plenty of talk about how they plan to take guns away from us, us law-abiding citizens.
[00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:11.893]  But if you take guns away from all of us legal gun owners, then the only people that will have guns will be the bad guys.
[00:46:12.554 --> 00:46:13.774]  In fact, I'm curious.
[00:46:14.174 --> 00:46:15.935]  I want to see a show of hands right now.
[00:46:16.295 --> 00:46:18.356]  All those for gun control, raise your hands.
[00:46:18.956 --> 00:46:21.757]  Alright, there's one, two, three, four.
[00:46:22.698 --> 00:46:23.178]  Anyone else?
[00:46:25.199 --> 00:46:26.559]  Ah, see there, that figures.
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:28.420]  All the usual suspects.
[00:46:29.601 --> 00:46:30.181]  Any questions?
[00:46:37.887 --> 00:46:43.930]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, you can get six months free at PrisonPlanet.tv, but only for one more week.
[00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:47.372]  Next Monday, the special that only comes around once the year ends.
[00:46:47.432 --> 00:46:58.417]  In fact, we've never offered six months free before, but I really want to get more people to join and be able to watch The Nightly News, to see the live reports we do, the special reports, all my films, e-books, and so much more.
[00:46:59.017 --> 00:47:01.799]  One person can share their membership with 20 people.
[00:47:02.719 --> 00:47:10.885]  And you are funding the absolute, very leading edge, the vanguard of the resistance to the globalist operation on every front.
[00:47:11.005 --> 00:47:15.689]  We have to have our own platform that is harder for them to censor, harder for the system to shut down.
[00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:17.490]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:23.114]  We put out the daily radio show free with the video and audio feeds at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:47:23.254 --> 00:47:31.280]  But it is the members that get the nightly news exclusively and first and the commercial free video podcasts and audio podcasts that are
[00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:47.026]  Paying it forward and financing and helping so many other people see the truth when we put the videos on Facebook, YouTube, and it's PrisonPlanet.tv that finances so much of the cameras, the equipment, the crew.
[00:47:47.426 --> 00:47:48.127]  The Reporters.
[00:47:48.447 --> 00:47:51.491]  You are becoming a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[00:47:51.751 --> 00:47:59.881]  You get exclusive HD, higher quality, get it first, and then you can download it, share it with friends and family, share your passcode with them, your username.
[00:48:00.081 --> 00:48:04.286]  It's a win-win, and then you're helping finance to put it out for free to everybody.
[00:48:04.506 --> 00:48:05.508]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:48:07.915 --> 00:48:09.276]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:48:09.576 --> 00:48:10.857]  You can't survive without it.
[00:48:11.057 --> 00:48:11.958]  But where do you get it?
[00:48:12.258 --> 00:48:18.022]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:48:18.242 --> 00:48:23.986]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.

[00:48:38.575 --> 00:48:49.062]  President Barack Obama's State of the Union was clearly directed by the District of Criminals' belief that the majority of Americans are misinformed, gullible, tax-paying idiots.
[00:48:49.483 --> 00:48:57.408]  Obama played to the corporacratic Millionaire's Club, peppered with Assyrian refugee and anti-gay marriage activist Kim Davis.
[00:48:57.628 --> 00:49:05.053]  This was propaganda theater of the highest order, replete with a Hollywood-style pre-show to fuel Obama's mountain of lies.
[00:49:05.373 --> 00:49:15.557]  The largest deception aimed at the declining viewership that actually tuned in was Obama's skewing of the state of the economy, something real Americans know far too well.
[00:49:15.777 --> 00:49:19.738]  We're in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history.
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:33.363]  More than 14 million new jobs, the strongest two years of job growth since the 1990s, an unemployment rate cut in half.
[00:49:34.008 --> 00:49:35.828]  Here's what Obama's not telling you.
[00:49:36.049 --> 00:49:38.209]  Not only are 70% of U.S.
[00:49:38.269 --> 00:49:42.150]  jobs now held by immigrant workers, but the average U.S.
[00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:45.811]  stock is already down over 20% this year.
[00:49:45.971 --> 00:49:49.432]  And the global economy is flirting with severe recession.
[00:49:49.612 --> 00:49:56.274]  In fact, the Royal Bank of Scotland even warned its clients to sell everything and exit the stock market as soon as possible.
[00:49:56.474 --> 00:50:00.317]  Even Obama's controller, George Soros, says the sky is falling.
[00:50:00.417 --> 00:50:04.940]  Perhaps what better reason than this to tell the American people it isn't?
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:15.608]  Obama's claim that 900,000 manufacturing jobs were created in his past six years twisted the fact that manufacturing jobs have actually diminished by 230,000.
[00:50:15.648 --> 00:50:17.729]  Obama claimed he cut the unemployment rate in half.
[00:50:20.171 --> 00:50:28.538]  He is measuring the fudged 5% unemployment rate by the dismal 10% unemployment rate he was responsible for in October of 2009.
[00:50:29.139 --> 00:50:40.289]  As more jobs go overseas and the labor arena shrinks back here at home, and baby boomers retire, nearly 95 million Americans are not in the workforce.
[00:50:41.389 --> 00:50:45.311]  35.4% of the country is on welfare.
[00:50:46.231 --> 00:50:50.012]  38.8% of which are white, and 39.8% which are black.
[00:50:50.352 --> 00:50:55.854]  While 62% of working Americans have less than $1,000 in savings.
[00:50:56.174 --> 00:51:01.716]  Another blatant lie was Obama's insistence that he attends his intelligence briefings every morning.
[00:51:02.076 --> 00:51:08.418]  Now as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time.
[00:51:11.067 --> 00:51:18.405]  But that's not primarily because of some looming superpower out there, and it's certainly not because of diminished American strength.
[00:51:19.124 --> 00:51:30.631]  Breitbart reported, during his first 1,225 days in office, Obama attended his presidential daily briefing just 536 times, or 43.8% of the time.
[00:51:30.791 --> 00:51:38.596]  During 2011 and his first half of 2012, his attendance became even less frequent, falling to just over 38%.
[00:51:39.997 --> 00:51:46.300]  By contrast, Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, almost never missed his daily intelligence briefings.
[00:51:46.521 --> 00:51:48.762]  The Government Accountability Institute report,
[00:51:49.002 --> 00:51:55.226]  ...revealed that President Barack Obama attended only 42.1% of his daily intelligence briefings.
[00:51:55.486 --> 00:52:03.952]  Obama appears to be speaking of an entirely separate intelligence briefing, as a leaked 2012 Pentagon document revealed the U.S.
[00:52:04.012 --> 00:52:15.039]  and other NATO nations deliberately backed al-Qaeda in Iraq, which morphed into ISIS, and other Islamic extremist groups to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
[00:52:15.407 --> 00:52:18.170]  Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far.
[00:52:18.651 --> 00:52:27.280]  And in the process, healthcare inflation has slowed, and our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.
[00:52:28.174 --> 00:52:56.054]  In reality, however, Obamacare is killing the economy, forcing businesses to cut back on hiring full-time employees because the law requires firms with 50 or more full-time workers to offer them affordable health insurance or pay a fine of $2,000 to $3,000 a worker, while the average taxpayer will be subjected to an incremental annual fine for not signing up for Obama's flagrant unconstitutional health care disaster.
[00:52:56.434 --> 00:53:15.908]  And if that arrogant display of power wasn't enough, Americans were quickly reassured of Obama's unyielding abuse of power the morning after his State of the Union address by White House Chief of Staff Dennis McDonoghue, who said, We'll do audacious executive action over the course of the rest of the year.
[00:53:16.209 --> 00:53:17.490]  I'm confident of that.
[00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:20.512]  More lies and unconstitutional executive orders.
[00:53:20.692 --> 00:53:24.435]  Could you expect anything less from a Manchurian candidate
[00:53:25.275 --> 00:53:45.505]  So if the federal government will not intercede in our affairs, then we must rise up and kill those who kill us!
[00:53:49.026 --> 00:53:50.587]  We want some of this earth!
[00:53:53.149 --> 00:53:56.672]  Or we'll tear this goddamn country up!
[00:53:59.894 --> 00:54:03.197]  Stop them and kill them!
[00:54:03.817 --> 00:54:09.902]  And let them feel the pain of death that we are feeling!
[00:54:12.064 --> 00:54:17.408]  As a student of my teacher, I think I should always be dignified
[00:54:19.065 --> 00:54:24.688]  In my expression, although sometimes in passion, I lose it.
[00:54:26.209 --> 00:54:45.981]  And so I thought about, you know, when they said Farrakhan, he wants to kill all white people and he's advocating 10,000 fearless men to go out and kill white people, as though I'm insane.
[00:54:47.081 --> 00:54:48.162]  That's insanity.
[00:54:49.335 --> 00:54:51.957]  And I've been teaching for 60 years, sir.
[00:54:52.917 --> 00:55:13.971]  And no one who follows me has ever gone out and killed a white person, harmed a Jewish person, bombed a synagogue, or even put some swastika on a synagogue, because that's against our religion to deface a house of worship.
[00:55:14.552 --> 00:55:16.193]  I'm saying that to say this.
[00:55:18.047 --> 00:55:38.160]  I, when I said in Florida, you know, naming all the blacks that got shot down, and according to something I just read, where one black man every 28 hours is shot by a policeman,
[00:55:38.914 --> 00:55:47.476]  And young black men are nine times more likely than other Americans to be killed by police officers in 2015.
[00:55:48.277 --> 00:56:01.060]  According to the findings of the Guardian newspaper, 1,134 deaths at the hands of law enforcement officers happened last year.
[00:56:02.581 --> 00:56:07.482]  As a black man who loves my people, I'm grieved
[00:56:08.194 --> 00:56:22.504]  Not only at police killing us, but I am grieved at our killing of each other, which sometimes is ten times more than what white policemen have done.
[00:56:23.465 --> 00:56:35.794]  So in my passion against that, and this has been gradually increasing with me over the years, I said, if the federal government
[00:56:37.145 --> 00:56:41.789]  Does not intercede to see that justice comes to us.
[00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:45.152]  Because that's the government's job.
[00:56:45.533 --> 00:56:48.295]  It's not my job to kill my killer.
[00:56:48.796 --> 00:56:57.764]  It's the government's job to arrest the killer, bring them before a court of law, and punish them for their misdeed.
[00:56:58.124 --> 00:57:03.449]  But when the government fails to do it, what are we to do?
[00:57:04.332 --> 00:57:06.774]  We have to defend our lives.
[00:57:07.314 --> 00:57:12.838]  And so I said, stalk them wherever you find them.
[00:57:13.438 --> 00:57:20.864]  Not everybody, just the ones that kill us out of the law of justice.
[00:57:21.244 --> 00:57:28.449]  If the government won't arrest them and do that, somehow we're going to ultimately do that.
[00:57:28.609 --> 00:57:31.651]  And then it leads to what they'll say.
[00:57:32.192 --> 00:57:33.273]  It's a race war?
[00:57:33.613 --> 00:57:33.773]  No.
[00:57:34.881 --> 00:57:41.543]  We are not in any position at all to engage in a race war.
[00:57:42.083 --> 00:57:43.163]  It's ridiculous.
[00:57:43.663 --> 00:57:44.924]  It's destructive.
[00:57:45.704 --> 00:57:47.744]  It's suicidal.
[00:57:48.424 --> 00:57:55.946]  However, persecution in the Quran, it says, is worse than slaughter.
[00:57:57.347 --> 00:58:00.027]  And you know, you talk about 1776,
[00:58:04.011 --> 00:58:05.212]  And you are so right.
[00:58:06.533 --> 00:58:11.798]  But in 1776, America had enough.
[00:58:12.919 --> 00:58:18.343]  The colonial people under Britain had enough.
[00:58:19.604 --> 00:58:27.070]  So when Patrick Henry said, give us liberty, or we are willing to pay the price, which is death.
[00:58:27.921 --> 00:58:38.712]  You force people into that when government fails to do its job to redress the grievance of the people who are suffering.
[00:58:39.393 --> 00:58:40.414]  And that's it for our show.
[00:58:40.494 --> 00:58:44.618]  I'm Jakari Jackson from the InfoWars Command Center, and we'll see you again tomorrow night.
[00:58:48.848 --> 00:58:49.969]  Knockout is back.
[00:58:50.309 --> 00:59:01.414]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[00:59:01.814 --> 00:59:03.515]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:04.015 --> 00:59:13.139]  L-theanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:59:13.539 --> 00:59:15.320]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.741]  It's the same price.
[00:59:17.481 --> 00:59:23.364]  As leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece, it has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult.
[00:59:23.904 --> 00:59:30.148]  It's got the GABA, so it would probably cost $50 to take all this as separate pills.
[00:59:30.648 --> 00:59:30.768]  It's $19.95.
[00:59:31.488 --> 00:59:33.830]  You take one or two of these,
[00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:38.213]  And it just is really clean restful sleep is what the reviews are.
[00:59:38.553 --> 00:59:42.476]  It's what I've experienced and it just synergistically puts everything in there.
