[00:00:14.793 --> 00:00:17.415]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:23.039]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.222]  I was saying that the book was being overnighted.
[00:00:28.222 --> 00:00:30.224]  It just arrived in the mail.
[00:00:30.224 --> 00:00:31.965]  Just arrived via FedEx.
[00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:32.726]  Boom!
[00:00:32.726 --> 00:00:36.088]  They're in the break, and I just had two minutes to read.
[00:00:36.088 --> 00:00:36.668]  I love history.
[00:00:36.668 --> 00:00:41.111]  I can't wait to read this new book, Scorched Earth, Restoring the Country After Obama.
[00:00:41.111 --> 00:00:42.653]  I opened to a page about Edmund Burke.
[00:00:43.753 --> 00:00:50.197]  Supporting the British Empire, but not supporting the empire erasing countries' cultures, which globalism is doing.
[00:00:50.197 --> 00:00:51.918]  And he's so sophisticated.
[00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:57.601]  He's probably the smartest talk show host out there when it comes to wide-ranging knowledge.
[00:00:57.601 --> 00:00:58.761]  George Norrie is really smart as well.
[00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:07.973]  When it comes to passion and taking the globalist on, and being well read, I mean, I'm right up there with Savage, but Savage really is a smart guy.
[00:01:07.973 --> 00:01:12.035]  Put it to you this way, I don't learn a lot of stuff from other people on radio.
[00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:18.858]  They just take a couple topics, repeat it over and over again, take phone calls, they don't even want to be there, they don't even want to be on air, they don't care, they just want money.
[00:01:19.398 --> 00:01:20.659]  Savage doesn't even need to be on air.
[00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.221]  He's a very successful person.
[00:01:22.221 --> 00:01:25.043]  And that's why I admire what he's doing and his plan.
[00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:25.824]  I've been listening to the show.
[00:01:25.824 --> 00:01:26.865]  He's been talking about Scorched Earth.
[00:01:26.865 --> 00:01:27.806]  I haven't read it yet.
[00:01:27.806 --> 00:01:30.288]  He's an excellent one to take back this country and this world.
[00:01:30.288 --> 00:01:33.391]  So Michael Savage joining us at the start of the next segment.
[00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:34.392]  In fact, there he is.
[00:01:34.392 --> 00:01:35.573]  He just came and sat down there.
[00:01:35.573 --> 00:01:39.837]  So we're going to come back right after this break and go to Michael Savage.
[00:01:39.837 --> 00:01:42.140]  First off, though, let's jam another phone call in here.
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.101]  Who is up next?
[00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:48.363]  Uh, let's go ahead and take a call here from Christian, Virginia.
[00:01:48.363 --> 00:01:48.944]  You're on the air.
[00:01:48.944 --> 00:01:50.364]  Go ahead.
[00:01:50.364 --> 00:01:59.069]  Alright, with Hillary falling and coughing and stumbling all over the place, I can't help but think to what Larry Nichols was saying about
[00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:10.221]  You know, a lot of people said months ago, look out, Hillary could be trying to get sympathy, she could play on this poor little her.
[00:02:10.221 --> 00:02:15.183]  The problem is the media lied about it, she lied about it, she's clearly really sick, okay?
[00:02:15.183 --> 00:02:16.603]  I mean, this is not fake.
[00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:19.404]  She could try to spin that now and use that crisis
[00:02:20.164 --> 00:02:22.786]  But I think, I don't think Hillary's long for this world.
[00:02:22.786 --> 00:02:26.769]  The word we've got from insiders is brain tumor was cut out in 2012.
[00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.111]  Brain tumor is back and is growing.
[00:02:29.111 --> 00:02:32.353]  But regardless, the media only shows her being a little bit dizzy.
[00:02:32.353 --> 00:02:33.954]  They don't show her falling on her face.
[00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:36.936]  So, what this is really about is discrediting the media.
[00:02:36.936 --> 00:02:37.377]  What do you think?
[00:02:38.963 --> 00:02:46.208]  I think it is about discrediting the media and also I think that they're trying to put it out there with the pneumonia thing even though it's a fake and it's a lie.
[00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:54.734]  If they put it out there now before the debates it gives them some kind of credibility going in there saying that oh she had pneumonia or oh she was sick.
[00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.711]  Well, I totally agree with you that this whole thing about pneumonia is bull.
[00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:01.652]  I mean, she hasn't had coughing fits for years from pneumonia.
[00:03:01.652 --> 00:03:05.153]  She hasn't been fainting and falling down, having blood clots from pneumonia.
[00:03:05.153 --> 00:03:08.174]  First, she said on Sunday that it was just hot out there.
[00:03:08.174 --> 00:03:10.115]  And then she said, oh, I was diagnosed with pneumonia.
[00:03:10.515 --> 00:03:11.777]  She didn't go to the hospital.
[00:03:11.777 --> 00:03:14.019]  She went to Chelsea's $10 million pad.
[00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.183]  She gets $6 million a year from the Clinton Foundation swindle.
[00:03:17.183 --> 00:03:22.950]  So she can, quote, then walk out and hug the little girl behind the police line, the Secret Service line.
[00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.795]  It doesn't get more staged in Pyongyang, North Korea.
[00:03:26.795 --> 00:03:27.816]  Thanks for the call, Chris.
[00:03:28.837 --> 00:03:32.919]  Now, we're going to go to John and Mike and Jennifer and Andrew and a lot of other folks.
[00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.240]  If you want to hold, if not, you can hang up.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.141]  I'll give the numbers out again later.
[00:03:36.141 --> 00:03:47.047]  After Michael Savage leaves us at the bottom of the hour, we're going to go to break and come back with Michael Savage and talk about currently what's happening, the dirty tricks he thinks they're going to play, and how we counter them.
[00:03:47.047 --> 00:03:52.570]  And then, how we would restore this country if a Donald J. Trump gets in.
[00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.092]  So, you talk about deplorables.
[00:03:56.178 --> 00:03:58.399]  I've been attacked by name.
[00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:03.081]  I know that the vice presidential candidate attacked me again and said I'm one of the top deplorables.
[00:04:03.081 --> 00:04:13.324]  But I tell you, we're talking maybe the king deplorable when we come back, according to the globalists, the leftists, the scum, the communists, the socialists, the New World Order people.
[00:04:13.324 --> 00:04:17.746]  Because Michael Savage has been one of the chief thorns in their side for decades.
[00:04:17.746 --> 00:04:19.647]  So we're going to ask one of the top deplorables.
[00:04:20.535 --> 00:04:23.917]  Where he thinks this is going and how we defeat them straight ahead.
[00:04:23.917 --> 00:04:29.440]  The book that's just now coming out is Scorched Earth, Restoring the Country After Obama.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.822]  Michael Savage, number one New York Times bestseller.
[00:04:32.822 --> 00:04:38.865]  And you can go to michaelsavage.wnd.com and we'll also give you his website.
[00:04:39.893 --> 00:04:46.418]  On the other side, MichaelSavage.com, the home of the Savage Nation, borders, language, culture.
[00:04:46.418 --> 00:04:47.879]  All this and more.
[00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:49.701]  Scorched Earth, now available.
[00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:50.662]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:50.662 --> 00:04:52.343]  This is the InfoWars.
[00:04:52.343 --> 00:04:54.444]  You can find us at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:00.257 --> 00:05:07.940]  The Japanese coastline has been struck again and the Fukushima reactor cooling system, it stops flowing amid the quake and tsunami that followed.
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.881]  Damaged nuclear plant, it struggles after this latest natural disaster.
[00:05:11.881 --> 00:05:20.784]  Now the cooling system of the third reactor at the Fukushima nuclear plant has stopped circulating water following a powerful 7.3 offshore earthquake this week.
[00:05:21.024 --> 00:05:33.109]  Tepco said that it managed to restart the system some 90 minutes after its failure, and the cooling system servicing the Unit 3 spent fuel pool was not able to circulate water to cool nuclear fuel because of a broken pump.
[00:05:33.109 --> 00:05:35.931]  All of this is according to the Nuclear Regulatory Agency.
[00:05:35.931 --> 00:05:46.015]  It turns out that this plant, for the second time, has been hit, and the immediate danger, although the agency admitted gradual rising temperatures, the exact cause of this cooling system stoppage
[00:05:46.175 --> 00:05:47.397]  That is currently unknown.
[00:05:47.397 --> 00:05:49.240]  Now, we've highlighted this on InfoWars.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.828]  Please check out our reports for more information regarding this latest quake and how it impacts the days coming forward.
[00:05:54.828 --> 00:05:57.432]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:05:59.983 --> 00:06:02.625]  I want to tell you about a brand new off-the-grid product.
[00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:04.787]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[00:06:04.787 --> 00:06:13.615]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110 appliances at your house, like small refrigerators, to keep your food from spoiling.
[00:06:13.615 --> 00:06:16.138]  The best part, though, you can take it with you.
[00:06:16.138 --> 00:06:22.003]  It's mobile, to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[00:06:22.003 --> 00:06:25.386]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity.
[00:06:25.726 --> 00:06:29.148]  Basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[00:06:29.148 --> 00:06:30.168]  A true innovation.
[00:06:30.168 --> 00:06:32.249]  I have never seen anything like this.
[00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:33.950]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.492]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[00:06:36.492 --> 00:06:40.654]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.
[00:06:40.654 --> 00:06:42.775]  Go to privatepowergrid.com.
[00:06:42.775 --> 00:06:44.796]  That's privatepowergrid.com.

[00:06:59.884 --> 00:07:07.347]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.

[00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:05.781]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:08.662]  Broke my leg in the Santa Fe.
[00:08:12.603 --> 00:08:21.069]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[00:08:21.069 --> 00:08:30.035]  Well, I gotta tell you, there's probably three people in the last few decades that have been on the front lines of fighting globalism.
[00:08:31.007 --> 00:08:32.128]  And getting made fun of it.
[00:08:32.128 --> 00:08:34.589]  That's Michael Savage, Alex Jones, and Matt Drudge.
[00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:38.771]  And I guess we're all here today because I'm told he just talked to Drudge, and Drudge is tuned in right now.
[00:08:38.771 --> 00:08:42.893]  Scorched Earth, Restoring the Country After Obama, Michael Savage.
[00:08:42.893 --> 00:08:44.114]  Very powerful book.
[00:08:44.114 --> 00:08:46.095]  Just got it today, been thumbing through it.
[00:08:46.095 --> 00:08:48.436]  I'm a big history buff, cannot wait to read this book.
[00:08:48.436 --> 00:08:52.678]  We need to make this number one on the New York Times bestseller list.
[00:08:52.678 --> 00:08:58.561]  It is a manifesto against the globalists that have literally taken this country and Europe over.
[00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:00.122]  Brexit is only the beginning.
[00:09:00.122 --> 00:09:00.682]  The globalists are
[00:09:00.742 --> 00:09:03.745]  Panicking in every major publication they run.
[00:09:03.745 --> 00:09:12.933]  The Economist, the New York Times, the Washington Post saying that if Trump defeats Hillary, the new world order is basically broke back.
[00:09:12.933 --> 00:09:16.357]  So we are in the title match of history.
[00:09:16.357 --> 00:09:19.560]  Everyone should go to bookstores to make this the number one book.
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.403]  Biden bookstores everywhere today scorched earth.
[00:09:23.403 --> 00:09:25.906]  This is the front lines of the info war.
[00:09:26.266 --> 00:09:35.735]  Joining us for the next 20 minutes or so is Michael Savage of the Savage Nation, one of the top radio shows in the country, New York Times best-selling author.
[00:09:35.735 --> 00:09:37.076]  You've got the floor, my friend.
[00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:42.561]  Let's talk about where we are, what we're facing, two minutes to midnight.
[00:09:42.561 --> 00:09:46.384]  Well, number one, you are really the field marshal of it all, Alex.
[00:09:46.384 --> 00:09:49.307]  Come on, we know that they're more afraid of you.
[00:09:50.094 --> 00:09:52.276]  And Infowars and almost anyone else in the media.
[00:09:52.276 --> 00:09:54.619]  I mean, you, Matt Trudge, there aren't too many left.
[00:09:54.619 --> 00:09:57.302]  That's what's worrisome, isn't it, Alex?
[00:09:57.302 --> 00:10:02.187]  And you were named by this evil machine, specifically.
[00:10:02.187 --> 00:10:06.572]  And I would say that, you know, you say hyperbole and this and that.
[00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:10.837]  We all won bad election away from losing everything, which is on the back of my book cover.
[00:10:11.664 --> 00:10:15.746]  And I don't know that we can recover from Obama's scorched earth policies.
[00:10:15.746 --> 00:10:18.228]  We know he's trampled the Constitution.
[00:10:18.228 --> 00:10:24.832]  And I don't know how any of your listeners, you know, whatever side they're on, you know, you know and I know, you get all the opposition listening.
[00:10:24.832 --> 00:10:30.015]  And I'd like all of the good progressives who listen to Alex to see if they can nail him to a cross.
[00:10:30.015 --> 00:10:34.738]  Tell me that one of these things has not magnified under this cretin in the White House.
[00:10:35.757 --> 00:10:39.540]  Is this not becoming a third world nation of terror?
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.961]  Check yes.
[00:10:40.961 --> 00:10:41.421]  Riots?
[00:10:41.421 --> 00:10:41.701]  Check.
[00:10:41.701 --> 00:10:43.022]  Black lives matter.
[00:10:43.022 --> 00:10:43.462]  Mobs?
[00:10:43.462 --> 00:10:43.943]  Check.
[00:10:43.943 --> 00:10:45.163]  Black lives matter.
[00:10:45.163 --> 00:10:45.664]  Chaos?
[00:10:45.664 --> 00:10:45.904]  Check.
[00:10:45.904 --> 00:10:47.105]  Barack Obama.
[00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:49.006]  Terror, riots, mobs and chaos.
[00:10:49.006 --> 00:10:51.468]  This is a novelty in American history.
[00:10:51.468 --> 00:10:54.510]  I haven't seen anything like this historically since the 60s.
[00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.471]  And before that, when was the last time you've seen America like this?
[00:10:57.471 --> 00:11:00.554]  And the beauty of all of this, Alex, is how he's gotten away with it because
[00:11:01.431 --> 00:11:03.812]  You've got to give him credit.
[00:11:03.812 --> 00:11:08.975]  Barry Obama is the slickest salesman of communism the world has ever, ever discovered.
[00:11:08.975 --> 00:11:22.402]  No screaming, no yelling, no threats, just a silk smooth, good-looking, nice guy with a lovely wife and children, selling the most evil poison the world has ever, ever been asked to ingest.
[00:11:24.073 --> 00:11:25.454]  And look how far he's gotten.
[00:11:25.454 --> 00:11:31.796]  And every time he gets away with another outrage against this nation, he raises the stakes like a junkie.
[00:11:31.796 --> 00:11:35.258]  He needs a higher dose of insult in order to maintain the high.
[00:11:35.258 --> 00:11:36.999]  Am I wrong, Alex?
[00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:38.319]  You're dead on, Mr. Savage.
[00:11:38.319 --> 00:11:39.660]  Dr. Savage, please continue.
[00:11:41.345 --> 00:11:47.828]  So, the question is, okay, I'm complaining about him, I'm saying she's worse, which is true, which is ludicrous.
[00:11:47.828 --> 00:11:50.369]  She says America wants change!
[00:11:50.369 --> 00:11:50.950]  From what?
[00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.811]  From the same policies she's going to continue?
[00:11:53.811 --> 00:11:56.432]  She's suddenly not a progressive lunatic?
[00:11:56.432 --> 00:12:00.154]  Wait a minute, she's going to change Obama's policies in which way?
[00:12:00.154 --> 00:12:02.035]  Make them worse?
[00:12:02.035 --> 00:12:04.976]  She can't go the other way, then she'd be Donald Trump.
[00:12:04.976 --> 00:12:06.657]  So it means she's going to make it even worse than him.
[00:12:08.083 --> 00:12:15.237]  That's if she remembers what she's supposed to do, and that's doubtful, as you well know, because she doesn't know how many times she fainted.
[00:12:15.237 --> 00:12:18.344]  So, the point is, how do we uncouple this insanity?
[00:12:19.156 --> 00:12:21.297]  It is going to be really hard.
[00:12:21.297 --> 00:12:34.082]  You know and I know, there was a UAC in the 1950s, and it's a dirty word of the most dirty of words, the House of Un-American Activities Committee, which was run by one of the great American patriots, Senator McCarthy.
[00:12:34.082 --> 00:12:37.683]  He has been completely decimated by the left.
[00:12:37.683 --> 00:12:43.886]  McCarthy was a tail gunner in World War II, one of the most dangerous positions you could ever have in an airplane.
[00:12:43.886 --> 00:12:44.206]  Right?
[00:12:44.206 --> 00:12:45.106]  Belly gunner, B-24.
[00:12:45.106 --> 00:12:48.688]  Easiest target was the tail, that's what they attacked.
[00:12:49.793 --> 00:12:51.074]  Listen what the left did to him.
[00:12:51.074 --> 00:12:53.516]  They called him, they mocked him and called him Tail Gunner Joe.
[00:12:53.516 --> 00:12:56.639]  In other words, they took his heroism and tried to turn it into a mockery.
[00:12:56.639 --> 00:12:58.501]  That was in the 50s, Alex!
[00:12:58.501 --> 00:13:01.363]  To show you who they were already, the communists.
[00:13:01.363 --> 00:13:03.625]  So what was McCarthy saying?
[00:13:03.625 --> 00:13:05.327]  This great war hero.
[00:13:05.327 --> 00:13:09.951]  He was saying that Hollywood had been infiltrated by communists.
[00:13:09.951 --> 00:13:12.413]  The journalists had been infiltrated by communists.
[00:13:12.413 --> 00:13:14.615]  Academia had been infiltrated by communists.
[00:13:14.615 --> 00:13:15.556]  And the government itself.
[00:13:16.633 --> 00:13:19.454]  Well, what happened was they had the hearings.
[00:13:19.454 --> 00:13:20.374]  They ruined him.
[00:13:20.374 --> 00:13:22.434]  They destroyed the man.
[00:13:22.434 --> 00:13:28.616]  And then what happened in the 1990s, I'm sure you remember the book, the Venona Papers came out.
[00:13:28.616 --> 00:13:31.256]  It was a Soviet Russian publication.
[00:13:31.256 --> 00:13:32.496]  Turned out it was all true.
[00:13:32.496 --> 00:13:33.677]  The Russian documents came out.
[00:13:33.677 --> 00:13:35.897]  It was worse than what McCarthy was saying.
[00:13:35.897 --> 00:13:36.657]  Worse?
[00:13:36.657 --> 00:13:43.959]  It confirmed who in Hollywood, who in academia, who in government was in fact an operative of the Soviet Union.
[00:13:44.966 --> 00:13:46.947]  So, there were subversives.
[00:13:46.947 --> 00:13:49.768]  UAC was exactly on target.
[00:13:49.768 --> 00:13:57.031]  I say the only way we can save this nation is not talking about it, but by rooting out the subversives in the United States of America.
[00:13:57.031 --> 00:14:01.313]  And I know many libertarians are afraid of this, for fear that it will turn on them.
[00:14:01.313 --> 00:14:03.274]  Well, let's put that fear aside for the moment.
[00:14:03.274 --> 00:14:05.915]  In fact, let me just add this since you're saying this, because this is a point I want to make.
[00:14:07.675 --> 00:14:12.897]  If you look at the globalists, if you look at their leftists, they're saying the alt-right can't be tolerated.
[00:14:12.897 --> 00:14:15.178]  They're saying we need to be shut down and arrested.
[00:14:15.178 --> 00:14:17.179]  Hillary says she's going to shut down Breitbart.
[00:14:17.179 --> 00:14:18.540]  That means drudge you.
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.621]  They say they're bringing back Fairness Doctrine.
[00:14:20.621 --> 00:14:22.482]  They say they're coming after us.
[00:14:22.482 --> 00:14:25.643]  They're run by this foreign globalist Soros.
[00:14:25.643 --> 00:14:27.384]  Russia's already kicked him out.
[00:14:27.384 --> 00:14:31.166]  These are foreign globalists here overthrowing our country.
[00:14:32.006 --> 00:14:34.989]  So under the Constitution, these aren't even citizens.
[00:14:34.989 --> 00:14:36.290]  They don't have the rights.
[00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:37.972]  They're here overthrowing the system.
[00:14:37.972 --> 00:14:41.214]  To survive, we must go on the offensive.
[00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:42.636]  We must root them out.
[00:14:42.636 --> 00:14:43.937]  It's the only way to ever beat them.
[00:14:43.937 --> 00:14:44.778]  They are criminals.
[00:14:44.778 --> 00:14:45.899]  They are subversives.
[00:14:45.899 --> 00:14:48.281]  They are Saul Alinsky pledging to Lucifer.
[00:14:48.281 --> 00:14:48.801]  Please continue.
[00:14:49.622 --> 00:14:53.704]  Yeah, they want to lynch all of us, if not electronically, then physically.
[00:14:53.704 --> 00:14:56.085]  And the fact of the matter is, they have names.
[00:14:56.085 --> 00:14:58.867]  These are not nameless, faceless organizations.
[00:14:58.867 --> 00:15:03.289]  The number one, and the worst of them all, in my humble opinion, is the ACLU.
[00:15:03.289 --> 00:15:06.211]  The Anti-Christian Liberties Union is the number one.
[00:15:06.211 --> 00:15:07.311]  They're the head of the snake.
[00:15:07.311 --> 00:15:09.933]  Now, the man behind all of it is George Soros.
[00:15:10.453 --> 00:15:12.695]  The most evil man on the planet in my estimation.
[00:15:12.695 --> 00:15:16.720]  The absolutely most evil person the world has seen in modern times.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:20.023]  You know, you don't have to hang people, electrocute them, put them in cages.
[00:15:20.023 --> 00:15:22.466]  You don't have to do the things that ISIS is doing to be evil.
[00:15:22.466 --> 00:15:25.949]  He's evil on a larger scale than the ISIS executioners are.
[00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:28.192]  Because he's gutting the United States of America.
[00:15:28.192 --> 00:15:29.753]  He's trampling on our Constitution.
[00:15:29.753 --> 00:15:31.315]  He helped fund the Arab Spring.
[00:15:31.315 --> 00:15:32.276]  He helped fund the Arab Spring.
[00:15:32.276 --> 00:15:33.017]  Hillary, all of them.
[00:15:33.979 --> 00:15:34.499]  Amen.
[00:15:34.499 --> 00:15:36.280]  And I keep saying she owns it.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:46.382]  He was the one who, by the way, he funded it, but you know who was the architect, the best I can put together, was Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's National Security Advisor.
[00:15:46.382 --> 00:15:48.183]  Brzezinski was the architect.
[00:15:48.183 --> 00:15:50.723]  Soros was the financier.
[00:15:50.723 --> 00:15:54.604]  Hillary Clinton was the publicist and an actor, along with John Kerry.
[00:15:54.604 --> 00:15:56.685]  I'd say she was the quarterback with Kerry and Obama.
[00:15:57.608 --> 00:15:58.949]  She destroyed the Middle East.
[00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:59.709]  She owns that.
[00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:01.471]  How does the media... Forget the media.
[00:16:01.471 --> 00:16:03.792]  Why doesn't Trump put her on a cross with that one?
[00:16:03.792 --> 00:16:06.434]  And by the way, Mr. Savage, Dr. Savage, that's not hyperbole!
[00:16:06.434 --> 00:16:11.677]  She literally destabilized 20-something countries that Al-Qaeda and ISIS are running around.
[00:16:11.677 --> 00:16:13.518]  Hundreds of thousands of dead Christians.
[00:16:13.518 --> 00:16:16.340]  They won't even let Christians out of the region.
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.522]  These people are demons, just like the true liberal Assange said.
[00:16:19.522 --> 00:16:21.003]  Look, I've got the documents.
[00:16:21.003 --> 00:16:23.005]  The press is dead if she gets in.
[00:16:23.005 --> 00:16:24.286]  Our necks are in nooses.
[00:16:24.286 --> 00:16:25.046]  She's a demon.
[00:16:25.046 --> 00:16:26.147]  You must stop her!
[00:16:27.293 --> 00:16:28.434]  I hear you.
[00:16:28.434 --> 00:16:37.720]  And I also saw who wrote the other day that Obama, the nice, slick, smooth, nice family man, has created the greatest surveillance state in the history of the world.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:44.185]  And suddenly liberals are afraid of it because they understand what happens when the guillotine stops, starts falling.
[00:16:44.185 --> 00:16:46.166]  First it takes out your opposition.
[00:16:46.166 --> 00:16:51.090]  But as the world learned during the French Revolution, the guillotine has an unlimited taste for blood.
[00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:54.971]  And it doesn't stop with the enemies of the revolution.
[00:16:54.971 --> 00:16:59.993]  Then they turn on their own kind and start executing their own so-called counter-revolutionaries.
[00:16:59.993 --> 00:17:01.713]  As was done in the Soviet Union.
[00:17:01.713 --> 00:17:03.014]  Always happens.
[00:17:03.014 --> 00:17:04.154]  As was done in Cuba.
[00:17:04.154 --> 00:17:05.435]  As was done in Hitler's Germany.
[00:17:05.435 --> 00:17:06.395]  They kill their own.
[00:17:06.395 --> 00:17:06.955]  The brown church.
[00:17:06.955 --> 00:17:09.656]  And the guillotine keeps falling and cuts heads.
[00:17:09.656 --> 00:17:11.777]  It is the most thirsty instrument on earth.
[00:17:11.777 --> 00:17:16.979]  And that's why the left ought to step up and shut their fat mouths when we stand up to these monsters.
[00:17:16.979 --> 00:17:19.900]  These monsters need to be stopped or we're all finished.
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:20.820]  Left, right and center.
[00:17:21.428 --> 00:17:21.808]  That's right.
[00:17:21.808 --> 00:17:22.569]  So how do we stop them?
[00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:25.592]  Your book, I just got it, incredible, gets into a blueprint, sir.
[00:17:25.592 --> 00:17:28.976]  With your incredible historical understanding, how do we beat these bastards?
[00:17:28.976 --> 00:17:32.560]  Because they know we've got them in a corner now, but what tricks are they going to play?
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.902]  And then if we get Trump in, the battle just begins.
[00:17:34.902 --> 00:17:35.823]  What do we do?
[00:17:35.823 --> 00:17:37.685]  Oh, you said the magic words.
[00:17:38.931 --> 00:17:41.253]  If Trump wins, the battle begins.
[00:17:41.253 --> 00:17:44.696]  Because we know he is surrounded by neocons, we see that.
[00:17:44.696 --> 00:17:47.659]  I was shocked to read yesterday, he hired Woolsey?
[00:17:47.659 --> 00:17:48.319]  Yeah.
[00:17:48.319 --> 00:17:48.980]  Woolsey?
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:53.404]  The former head of the CIA under Bill Clinton is now going to be his CIA director?
[00:17:53.404 --> 00:17:56.827]  So I laid in bed last night, I said, wait a minute, what is this about?
[00:17:56.827 --> 00:17:59.589]  And I said, well, you know, the CIA is a complicated organization.
[00:18:00.606 --> 00:18:03.368]  I mean, you need someone who knows how to run it, right?
[00:18:03.368 --> 00:18:04.989]  But look at Woolsey's track record.
[00:18:04.989 --> 00:18:07.871]  How could he have joined it as a senior advisor?
[00:18:07.871 --> 00:18:08.811]  Why him?
[00:18:08.811 --> 00:18:14.495]  Isn't there a returning combat veteran who worked in military intelligence who would have been a better choice?
[00:18:14.495 --> 00:18:17.277]  Some higher-up American citizen, patriot?
[00:18:17.277 --> 00:18:18.317]  Somebody like General Flynn?
[00:18:18.317 --> 00:18:19.518]  CIA under Trump?
[00:18:19.518 --> 00:18:21.019]  Why Woolsey?
[00:18:21.019 --> 00:18:24.041]  Why Foggy Bottom all over again?
[00:18:24.041 --> 00:18:25.942]  Okay, but Alex, I don't want to waste your time.
[00:18:25.942 --> 00:18:26.583]  No, please, take over!
[00:18:28.888 --> 00:18:30.929]  The way to defeat the enemy is to know your enemy.
[00:18:30.929 --> 00:18:32.410]  The way to know your enemy is to name the enemy.
[00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:39.355]  So who are the subversive organizations who have destroyed and are destroying our civil liberties?
[00:18:39.355 --> 00:18:40.996]  We know the ACLU.
[00:18:40.996 --> 00:18:43.418]  We know the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:18:43.418 --> 00:18:44.458]  We don't care.
[00:18:44.458 --> 00:18:46.580]  In my opinion, those are the three top of them.
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.781]  But I want to read to you all the others.
[00:18:48.781 --> 00:18:49.682]  Can I do that?
[00:18:49.682 --> 00:18:52.304]  Because I made a whole list in scorched earth.
[00:18:52.304 --> 00:18:53.985]  I studied the cockroaches.
[00:18:53.985 --> 00:18:56.286]  And I said, let's bring them into the light and expose them.
[00:18:56.286 --> 00:18:58.588]  Make them scatter like cockroaches when you turn on the light.
[00:18:59.508 --> 00:19:03.531]  The request I am making, Alex Jones, and to all you listeners, is this.
[00:19:03.531 --> 00:19:06.434]  Name subversive organizations.
[00:19:06.434 --> 00:19:12.818]  As organizations you consider to be so far off the ideal of the American way, that they are in fact subversive.
[00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:14.099]  And what does that mean?
[00:19:14.099 --> 00:19:20.364]  That means they spend all of their resources going against the wishes of the Constitution and the taxpayer.
[00:19:20.364 --> 00:19:22.325]  So who are they?
[00:19:22.325 --> 00:19:23.266]  I have a list.
[00:19:23.266 --> 00:19:24.407]  They're right here.
[00:19:24.407 --> 00:19:25.267]  Who are these organizations?
[00:19:25.267 --> 00:19:26.088]  They're trying to conquer us.
[00:19:27.788 --> 00:19:29.588]  They've done a pretty good job so far.
[00:19:29.588 --> 00:19:33.929]  They see us as deplorable because we just want to be free.
[00:19:33.929 --> 00:19:35.810]  National Lawyers Guild?
[00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:36.450]  Who are they?
[00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.091]  One of the most dangerous activist groups in the nation.
[00:19:39.091 --> 00:19:53.894]  Every time there was a riot by Black Thugs Matter at an anti-police protest, the scum in the National Lawyers Guild sent out their deranged, psychotic lawyers from the worst law schools in America to make sure the police could not do their jobs.
[00:19:54.714 --> 00:20:02.142]  Every last shyster in the National Lawyers Guild is the type of lawyer that you have come to hate in plain English.
[00:20:02.142 --> 00:20:08.770]  Now of course they will argue that they're just for the underdog, that they're for the poor immigrant and the oppressed minority.
[00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:09.771]  Well you know what?
[00:20:09.771 --> 00:20:10.411]  I don't buy it.
[00:20:11.192 --> 00:20:14.955]  I want a lawyer's guilt for the tax-paying middle class, Alex.
[00:20:14.955 --> 00:20:21.340]  Not a lawyer's guilt for the subversives who are bringing in refugees, immigrants, whatever you want to call them, by the tens of millions.
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.923]  And we have the Soros emails where he admits it's to destabilize the country.
[00:20:24.923 --> 00:20:28.085]  He admits destabilization.
[00:20:28.085 --> 00:20:28.906]  Who admitted that?
[00:20:28.906 --> 00:20:31.888]  George Soros in the latest DC Leaks and others.
[00:20:31.888 --> 00:20:35.471]  He's in there admitting that it's a plan to overthrow Europe and the US and create racial strife.
[00:20:36.823 --> 00:20:37.764]  Correct.
[00:20:37.764 --> 00:20:39.825]  Alliance for Democracy.
[00:20:39.825 --> 00:20:41.266]  Amnesty International.
[00:20:41.266 --> 00:20:42.627]  Black Lives Matter.
[00:20:42.627 --> 00:20:44.488]  Center for American Progress.
[00:20:44.488 --> 00:20:45.809]  Center for Media and Democracy.
[00:20:45.809 --> 00:20:47.050]  I'll read a few of them.
[00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.352]  Center for Science and the Public Interest.
[00:20:49.352 --> 00:20:51.093]  Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics.
[00:20:51.093 --> 00:20:54.976]  I have two pages that I researched, Alex, in my book.
[00:20:54.976 --> 00:20:56.697]  Is Media Matters and David Brock in there?
[00:20:58.902 --> 00:21:00.522]  They're all over the place.
[00:21:00.522 --> 00:21:03.524]  You name these organizations, it's like a spiderweb.
[00:21:03.524 --> 00:21:05.405]  Rockefeller Brothers Foundation.
[00:21:05.405 --> 00:21:06.566]  Blue Moon Fund.
[00:21:06.566 --> 00:21:07.366]  Things you never heard of.
[00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:09.047]  Ford Foundation.
[00:21:09.047 --> 00:21:10.127]  Joyce Foundation.
[00:21:10.127 --> 00:21:12.068]  Who ever heard of the Joyce Foundation?
[00:21:12.068 --> 00:21:13.589]  HKH Foundation.
[00:21:13.589 --> 00:21:14.810]  Dolan Charitable Trust.
[00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:24.479]  Vanguard Foundation, Archer Foundation, Solinsky's Back of the Yards Community Council, National Hip-Hop Political Convention, Cuban Council of Churches.
[00:21:24.479 --> 00:21:26.841]  People don't even know these organizations.
[00:21:26.841 --> 00:21:34.349]  These cockroaches are crawling all over us, devouring our flag of liberty, Al.
[00:21:34.349 --> 00:21:39.214]  You're absolutely right, and they admit they want to collapse us and our borders into a world government, Dr. Savage.
[00:21:40.851 --> 00:21:48.144]  When you say the battle just begins, and I say that if Trump gets in, and I'm not counting our chickens yet, I mean, why do you say the battle just begins?
[00:21:48.144 --> 00:21:49.467]  We just lost to Skype.
[00:21:49.467 --> 00:21:51.991]  Skype is a wondrous thing, but it has its issues.
[00:21:51.991 --> 00:21:53.654]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is so historical.
[00:21:54.775 --> 00:22:00.017]  The establishments control the left and the right to bring in globalism, but they're making their worldwide takeover with the left.
[00:22:00.017 --> 00:22:01.858]  And this is not a liberal group.
[00:22:01.858 --> 00:22:05.459]  Liberal means lower taxes, more freedom, more control locally.
[00:22:05.459 --> 00:22:06.299]  This is not liberal.
[00:22:06.299 --> 00:22:08.520]  They call themselves liberal to have the moral high ground.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.902]  The Republican establishment is working with them in a big, big way.
[00:22:12.902 --> 00:22:16.463]  The book is Scorched Earth, Restoring the Country After Obama, Michael Savage.
[00:22:16.983 --> 00:22:20.125]  We're listed supported by you, our main sponsor.
[00:22:20.125 --> 00:22:23.147]  We have Hillary for Prison shirts at cost $9.95.
[00:22:23.147 --> 00:22:25.569]  That includes the shipping, $9.95.
[00:22:25.569 --> 00:22:28.831]  $9.95 shipping and the shirt all together.
[00:22:28.831 --> 00:22:30.312]  That funds the operation.
[00:22:30.312 --> 00:22:33.554]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com for our supplements.
[00:22:34.114 --> 00:22:38.178]  But get the book, Scorched Earth, Restoring the Country After Obama, Michael Savage.
[00:22:38.178 --> 00:22:44.385]  Get it in stores so that it becomes basically an end cap and a best seller to educate people that are not aware of what's happening.
[00:22:44.385 --> 00:22:46.627]  Because that's Michael Savage's real skill, I found.
[00:22:46.627 --> 00:22:48.149]  That's something I'm able to do as well.
[00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:51.692]  Most of these mainline right-wingers can't do it because they're just following a script.
[00:22:51.692 --> 00:22:55.416]  Is that he's able to get leftists, a lot of them that mean well, out of their cocoon.
[00:22:56.577 --> 00:23:01.479]  And Dr. Savage continuing with these subversive organizations in the five, six minutes we have left.
[00:23:01.479 --> 00:23:04.021]  You promised to come back next week if your voice is announced.
[00:23:04.021 --> 00:23:07.222]  I really appreciate you to do more and talk about the campaign.
[00:23:07.222 --> 00:23:16.427]  But hitting some of these other areas, her health, her cover-up, the mainstream media's ratings imploding, them trying to start all these new wars.
[00:23:16.427 --> 00:23:19.648]  Russia, I'm not lionizing Putin, but he's bringing back nationalism.
[00:23:19.648 --> 00:23:21.149]  He's arrested and thrown out.
[00:23:21.149 --> 00:23:23.250]  All the Soros people as subversive.
[00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.151]  I mean, just all the crazy things happening.
[00:23:25.831 --> 00:23:26.972]  It seems there's a quickening.
[00:23:26.972 --> 00:23:27.733]  Do you agree with that?
[00:23:27.733 --> 00:23:31.236]  And what does this signify?
[00:23:31.236 --> 00:23:34.198]  What you just said, you explained it better than I could, Alex.
[00:23:34.198 --> 00:23:36.720]  I mean, you see the global picture.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.062]  The fact is, which one do you want me to talk about?
[00:23:39.062 --> 00:23:39.823]  Any one you want.
[00:23:39.823 --> 00:23:42.085]  Just, I mean, the top things.
[00:23:42.085 --> 00:23:48.650]  In the middle of us talking about and me listing all the subversive organizations that I researched and scorched earth, did you notice what happened?
[00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.472]  We lost the connection that my Skype dropped.
[00:23:50.472 --> 00:23:51.412]  Did you catch that one?
[00:23:51.412 --> 00:23:51.873]  It's crazy.
[00:23:52.093 --> 00:23:54.677]  Well, they admit Google's all game, the Internet's game.
[00:23:54.677 --> 00:23:56.961]  They admit they're blocking terms for searching on Hillary.
[00:23:56.961 --> 00:24:01.027]  They admit they're censoring Patriot groups in Europe that criticize open borders.
[00:24:01.027 --> 00:24:02.349]  It's crazy.
[00:24:02.349 --> 00:24:03.972]  You mentioned a key word there, Google.
[00:24:04.935 --> 00:24:10.377]  For weeks, I've been railing against the monopolies that have emerged in America under Obama, the dictator.
[00:24:10.377 --> 00:24:15.240]  Google, Facebook, Microsoft, of course, have been there before.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.380]  Look at these companies.
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:21.202]  They're violating the antitrust statutes of the United States legal system.
[00:24:21.202 --> 00:24:22.523]  There is an antitrust division.
[00:24:23.363 --> 00:24:23.964]  We're good to go.
[00:24:42.364 --> 00:24:48.369]  And use the Justice Department to break up these monopolies and give other people a chance to build a business.
[00:24:48.369 --> 00:24:55.915]  And I make a point of Teddy Roosevelt, who was a populist, as you well know, and his campaign slogan was, bust the trusts.
[00:24:55.915 --> 00:25:04.681]  The trusts in his day were Standard Oil, Rockefeller's Railroads, an oil company that dominated railroads and dominated the oil business.
[00:25:04.681 --> 00:25:06.463]  They didn't give anyone a chance of emerging.
[00:25:06.463 --> 00:25:07.444]  If they did, they crushed them.
[00:25:07.444 --> 00:25:10.386]  And it's the same globalist grandkids today that are running globalism.
[00:25:11.633 --> 00:25:16.116]  Zuckerberg, 58 billion dollars isn't enough for that pig?
[00:25:16.116 --> 00:25:22.040]  He needs to cut the wages of American workers and throw them out of the country and bring in Indians who work for one-third the wage?
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.423]  God bless India, God bless their intelligence, God bless Indian workers.
[00:25:25.423 --> 00:25:27.765]  But we've got to look out for us a little bit.
[00:25:27.765 --> 00:25:28.725]  They belong in India.
[00:25:28.725 --> 00:25:33.709]  Let them rebuild their own economy and let them hire IT workers at a right salary.
[00:25:33.709 --> 00:25:36.211]  So, yeah, you want to talk about jobs.
[00:25:36.211 --> 00:25:38.872]  Why do you think, not you, I'm talking Rick Clark.
[00:25:40.146 --> 00:25:45.988]  Why do you think Trump is surging amongst the blue-collar, disenfranchised, white male?
[00:25:45.988 --> 00:25:46.708]  Why?
[00:25:46.708 --> 00:25:49.108]  Because they've been dumped upon.
[00:25:49.108 --> 00:25:50.669]  They've been stepped upon.
[00:25:50.669 --> 00:26:01.952]  The Eddys, whose grandfathers defeated Hitler, the Eddys whose fathers died in the jungles of Vietnam, are being crapped upon by these vermin, these cowardly vermin, these sick, deviant perverts.
[00:26:01.952 --> 00:26:02.932]  I can't stand it.
[00:26:02.932 --> 00:26:04.373]  I'll get worked up, but I don't want to.
[00:26:04.373 --> 00:26:05.693]  I'm trying not to, Alex.
[00:26:05.693 --> 00:26:08.494]  This is the first interview I've done for this book.
[00:26:08.494 --> 00:26:08.734]  Wow.
[00:26:08.734 --> 00:26:08.994]  Thank you.
[00:26:09.814 --> 00:26:12.277]  And Alex, I gotta tell you, you're on the front lines.
[00:26:12.277 --> 00:26:16.561]  You're gonna be around a lot longer than I am in the media and probably on this planet.
[00:26:16.561 --> 00:26:19.685]  And you're doing the job that needs to be done.
[00:26:19.685 --> 00:26:29.655]  And all I can say is as the time comes to an end right here, when I say that Obama and the left are practicing a scorched earth policy, there's a reason for it.
[00:26:30.495 --> 00:26:33.656]  When an army retreated in the past, they burnt everything to the ground.
[00:26:33.656 --> 00:26:34.837]  They burnt the crops.
[00:26:34.837 --> 00:26:36.157]  They killed the livestock.
[00:26:36.157 --> 00:26:37.077]  They burned the barns.
[00:26:37.077 --> 00:26:38.358]  They burned the houses.
[00:26:38.358 --> 00:26:43.660]  Is that not what's going on here with this left, when they see an ascendant right, an ascendant American?
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:45.601]  That's right, they're blowing it all up!
[00:26:45.601 --> 00:26:49.082]  They're burning our pathways to survival.
[00:26:49.082 --> 00:26:50.943]  They're burning our internet.
[00:26:50.943 --> 00:26:52.703]  They want to burn radio.
[00:26:52.703 --> 00:26:54.184]  They want to burn any access to the internet.
[00:26:54.184 --> 00:26:54.924]  They're trying to start a race war.
[00:26:54.924 --> 00:26:55.885]  They're saying kill the cops.
[00:26:55.885 --> 00:26:56.785]  They're getting away with everything!
[00:26:58.317 --> 00:27:03.139]  I keep saying, Soros gave them 70 million dollars to those street thugs?
[00:27:03.139 --> 00:27:09.782]  All we need now is Obama to turn them into his well-funded private army.
[00:27:09.782 --> 00:27:14.503]  He can deputize them and give them government arms as he did ISIS.
[00:27:14.503 --> 00:27:18.625]  And then you will have the young pioneers of the Soviet Union.
[00:27:18.625 --> 00:27:20.486]  You will have the Red Brigades.
[00:27:20.486 --> 00:27:25.808]  You will have the Red Brigades of Communist China frightening everybody in the society
[00:27:27.345 --> 00:27:28.386]  on a daily basis.
[00:27:28.386 --> 00:27:31.668]  Alex, we're that close to it all coming to that.
[00:27:31.668 --> 00:27:33.890]  Obama is not finished yet.
[00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:37.633]  He has several months left yet to burn it all down, Alex.
[00:27:37.633 --> 00:27:38.213]  I agree.
[00:27:38.213 --> 00:27:39.514]  We've only got a minute left then.
[00:27:39.514 --> 00:27:42.216]  In your gut, you're a smart cookie, Dr. Savage.
[00:27:42.216 --> 00:27:43.417]  What do you expect them to pull?
[00:27:44.582 --> 00:27:47.925]  Remember what George Bush did in the last few months of his regime?
[00:27:47.925 --> 00:27:51.169]  I was screaming and warning George Bush is a fiscal socialist.
[00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:52.029]  He's not through, yes?
[00:27:52.029 --> 00:27:54.732]  Do you remember the housing crisis that followed?
[00:27:54.732 --> 00:28:04.862]  I expect that if it looks like Trump is going to win or Grandma falls off the stage again for good and they replace her with Freddie from one of the Nightmare movies, Cain Who Can't Win.
[00:28:06.043 --> 00:28:07.444]  I expect the worst.
[00:28:07.444 --> 00:28:09.826]  I expect them calling off the election.
[00:28:09.826 --> 00:28:11.147]  I expect martial law.
[00:28:11.147 --> 00:28:18.373]  I expect, if that is not possible, I expect a financial, complete financial breakdown to create even further chaos.
[00:28:18.373 --> 00:28:19.134]  That's what I expect.
[00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:20.592]  I concur with that.
[00:28:20.592 --> 00:28:25.556]  So every person of every race, color, and creed that wants to live in a somewhat free country, now be involved.
[00:28:25.556 --> 00:28:26.236]  Spread the word.
[00:28:26.236 --> 00:28:27.057]  Expose these people.
[00:28:27.057 --> 00:28:31.440]  They're all over the news pushing the idea of suspending the election now because of Hillary.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.801]  The book Scorched Earth.
[00:28:32.801 --> 00:28:34.923]  In bookstores all over the country.
[00:28:34.923 --> 00:28:35.604]  Michael Savage.
[00:28:35.604 --> 00:28:37.005]  MichaelSavage.com.
[00:28:37.005 --> 00:28:40.087]  Thank you so much for spending so much time with us today.
[00:28:40.087 --> 00:28:41.488]  We've got about 45 seconds.
[00:28:41.488 --> 00:28:42.009]  Final point.
[00:28:43.663 --> 00:28:45.004]  There is no final point.
[00:28:45.004 --> 00:28:46.625]  The nation is wrecked right now.
[00:28:46.625 --> 00:28:52.770]  It's going to be unredeemably destroyed unless the Republican candidate wins.
[00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:57.354]  And I keep saying Republican candidate now because if I say the word Trump, people turn off.
[00:28:57.354 --> 00:29:02.878]  There are so many anti-Trump fake conservatives out there that the minute you say Trump, they go into overdrive.
[00:29:02.878 --> 00:29:04.780]  So say the Republican candidate.
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:08.042]  That makes it a little easier for them to recognize that there is a choice right now.
[00:29:08.042 --> 00:29:10.584]  They're really showing themselves as operatives, aren't they?
[00:29:10.584 --> 00:29:10.644]  Oh!
[00:29:11.781 --> 00:29:18.364]  All the people who hate Alex Jones and Michael Savage, who are true blue conservatives, who are they?
[00:29:18.364 --> 00:29:19.784]  Who are they, Alex?
[00:29:19.784 --> 00:29:21.985]  We don't even need to say their names because they've destroyed themselves.
[00:29:21.985 --> 00:29:23.066]  That's the good news.
[00:29:23.066 --> 00:29:23.906]  They're losing the war.
[00:29:23.906 --> 00:29:24.927]  They've revealed themselves.
[00:29:24.927 --> 00:29:26.527]  The fight's now out in the open.
[00:29:26.527 --> 00:29:28.988]  And Dr. Savage, my gut tells me we're going to win in the end.
[00:29:28.988 --> 00:29:30.609]  What do you think?
[00:29:30.609 --> 00:29:35.471]  Well, with men like Glenn Beck rubbing his face in cornflakes, who is obviously a very
[00:29:36.425 --> 00:29:39.327]  I mean, you look at him putting his face in cornflakes.
[00:29:39.327 --> 00:29:45.172]  The man is obviously a very disturbed individual who was never on any solid ground.
[00:29:45.172 --> 00:29:49.435]  And I have said before, liberalism is a mental disorder.
[00:29:49.435 --> 00:29:50.816]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.816 --> 00:29:53.358]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.358 --> 00:29:56.020]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:06.925]  Well, it looks like President-elect Donald Trump is making good on his promises day one of the Trump presidency to withdraw from the TPP.
[00:30:06.925 --> 00:30:10.968]  We have an article that's up on our website, Infowars.com, and aggregated from CNS News.
[00:30:10.968 --> 00:30:17.153]  It talks about how Trump characterized the move, a part of a plan to advance the simple core principle of, quote, putting America first.
[00:30:17.153 --> 00:30:20.536]  Of course, that's been his credo down with globalism the entire campaign.
[00:30:20.536 --> 00:30:28.622]  And now that President-elect Donald Trump, who said on Monday that his first day in office next January will be to begin the process of withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
[00:30:29.022 --> 00:30:29.462]  We're good to go.
[00:31:00.042 --> 00:31:02.083]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[00:31:02.083 --> 00:31:03.304]  Try a bottle of it.
[00:31:03.304 --> 00:31:04.884]  Rob Dew joins us.
[00:31:04.884 --> 00:31:07.985]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[00:31:07.985 --> 00:31:09.066]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[00:31:09.066 --> 00:31:10.046]  I've been working all day.
[00:31:10.046 --> 00:31:12.527]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[00:31:12.527 --> 00:31:13.548]  I get in here at 830.
[00:31:14.488 --> 00:31:16.149]  I was kind of run down, you know.
[00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:17.810]  I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:19.671]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[00:31:19.671 --> 00:31:21.511]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[00:31:21.511 --> 00:31:22.552]  I popped two of them.
[00:31:22.552 --> 00:31:24.833]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[00:31:24.833 --> 00:31:26.814]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[00:31:26.814 --> 00:31:28.295]  It's got four and a half stars.
[00:31:28.295 --> 00:31:29.635]  People really love it.
[00:31:29.635 --> 00:31:30.236]  Read about it.
[00:31:30.236 --> 00:31:34.057]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[00:31:34.057 --> 00:31:39.340]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:43.562]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[00:31:43.562 --> 00:31:49.705]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[00:31:49.705 --> 00:31:55.628]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:31:59.813 --> 00:32:06.358]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:32:06.358 --> 00:32:09.580]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:15.164]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:32:15.164 --> 00:32:21.268]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:32:21.268 --> 00:32:24.571]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:32:24.571 --> 00:32:26.012]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[00:32:26.212 --> 00:32:30.514]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:32:30.514 --> 00:32:33.456]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:32:33.456 --> 00:32:35.137]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:32:35.137 --> 00:32:38.579]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:32:38.579 --> 00:32:41.180]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:42.221]  It's in powder form.
[00:32:42.221 --> 00:32:45.102]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:32:45.102 --> 00:32:46.243]  I take this.
[00:32:46.243 --> 00:32:47.644]  This is the product that I take.
[00:32:47.644 --> 00:32:49.605]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:32:50.425 --> 00:32:51.226]  We fight the Globos.
[00:32:51.226 --> 00:32:52.367]  We fight the New World Order.
[00:32:52.367 --> 00:32:56.530]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLive.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:33:10.864 --> 00:33:19.768]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:19.768 --> 00:33:25.110]  Alright, Tracy Martin, the admitted long-time chef of the Clintons, heard amazing stuff.
[00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:26.611]  You're gonna get an exclusive right now.
[00:33:26.611 --> 00:33:28.192]  About to join us in about two minutes.
[00:33:29.341 --> 00:33:32.782]  Michael Savage, a best-selling author, researcher in the WikiLeaks.
[00:33:32.782 --> 00:33:35.624]  Hillary getting him blocked from traveling to the UK.
[00:33:35.624 --> 00:33:38.625]  They now admit to set a precedent to ban anybody they want from traveling.
[00:33:38.625 --> 00:33:41.506]  I mean, you talk about Nazi Germany, folks, that gets overused.
[00:33:41.506 --> 00:33:44.367]  This is the essence of authoritarianism.
[00:33:44.367 --> 00:33:51.030]  The Democrats have tried to get travel bans if the IRS opens an audit up where you can't travel outside the U.S.
[00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:54.914]  They now want to expand it to just flying period.
[00:33:54.914 --> 00:33:56.896]  These are internal checkpoints.
[00:33:56.896 --> 00:34:00.219]  The book is Scorched Earth, Restoring the Country After Obama.
[00:34:00.219 --> 00:34:02.001]  Dr. Savage is our guest.
[00:34:02.001 --> 00:34:04.463]  20 days, ladies and gentlemen, to the election.
[00:34:04.463 --> 00:34:07.226]  Doctor, you got cut off by that hard break I had to take.
[00:34:07.226 --> 00:34:09.088]  Recapping for folks that just joined us.
[00:34:09.088 --> 00:34:10.389]  Thousands a second are tuning in.
[00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:11.570]  I don't know.
[00:34:26.371 --> 00:34:27.972]  Election fraud doesn't exist.
[00:34:27.972 --> 00:34:30.273]  That's an exact quote of Obama.
[00:34:30.273 --> 00:34:37.717]  So I'm living in this crazy world where they're federalizing the elections, first time ever, taking them over because of an unprecedented threat.
[00:34:37.717 --> 00:34:42.360]  When Trump says you might try to steal it, they go, you're insane, it doesn't exist.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:45.301]  So Dr. Savage, you talked to him yesterday on air.
[00:34:45.301 --> 00:34:46.022]  What do you think's happening?
[00:34:46.727 --> 00:34:48.168]  I said to Donald, here's what they're doing.
[00:34:48.168 --> 00:34:50.108]  They're setting it up as follows.
[00:34:50.108 --> 00:34:53.290]  For three, four months they've been saying the Russians are hacking our elections.
[00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:58.072]  They're saying to protect our elections, which are sacred, we want to turn it over to DHS.
[00:34:58.072 --> 00:35:01.994]  The genius has given us one terrorist attack after another and has done nothing to stop it.
[00:35:01.994 --> 00:35:03.554]  He still has his job, right?
[00:35:03.554 --> 00:35:06.315]  So he wants to now make sure our elections are safe.
[00:35:06.315 --> 00:35:07.136]  Russians are hacking.
[00:35:07.856 --> 00:35:09.037]  Follow the bouncing ball.
[00:35:09.037 --> 00:35:09.997]  No proof.
[00:35:09.997 --> 00:35:28.126]  If Trump wins, which is highly likely by the way, which we can talk about in a minute or two or another time, Trump wins, government declares, oh we have evidence that the Russians hacked it, he's a friend of Putin, the election is null and void, we're going to recall another election in what, six months?
[00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:31.148]  Until then, Mr. Obama has graciously agreed
[00:35:32.128 --> 00:35:35.751]  To continue his public service in the United States of America.
[00:35:35.751 --> 00:35:36.612]  Thank you very much.
[00:35:36.612 --> 00:35:37.773]  We're not taking any questions.
[00:35:37.773 --> 00:35:40.315]  Goodbye.
[00:35:40.315 --> 00:35:49.422]  And we have Biden announcing they're going to launch a giant cyber attack on the Russians and saying if the Russians respond, they may respond militarily, which is a doctrine Hillary came out with two months ago.
[00:35:49.422 --> 00:35:51.945]  And suddenly NATO announced that's their new doctrine.
[00:35:51.945 --> 00:35:53.406]  She's literally calling the show.
[00:35:54.744 --> 00:35:57.646]  All I wanted to say was, I said it to Donald and he didn't take the bait.
[00:35:57.646 --> 00:35:58.307]  I'm glad he didn't.
[00:35:58.307 --> 00:36:02.690]  I said, don't even answer me, because they'll crucify you if you agree with me.
[00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:05.413]  They're going to steal the election.
[00:36:05.413 --> 00:36:06.253]  I'll make it simple.
[00:36:06.253 --> 00:36:10.016]  In the fifth grade, I ran for class president in Queens, New York.
[00:36:10.016 --> 00:36:10.997]  I was a funny kid.
[00:36:10.997 --> 00:36:11.858]  I was a wild kid.
[00:36:11.858 --> 00:36:12.678]  I was out of control.
[00:36:12.678 --> 00:36:14.740]  I won the election by a landslide.
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:19.264]  The teacher stood up and said, this election doesn't count.
[00:36:19.264 --> 00:36:20.625]  I don't want Michael to be president.
[00:36:22.298 --> 00:36:25.622]  She had another election, and I wasn't class president.
[00:36:25.622 --> 00:36:30.367]  So, hey, look, if it can be done in the fifth grade in the Bronx when I was a kid, why can't they do it to us now, right?
[00:36:30.367 --> 00:36:31.008]  We're just children.
[00:36:32.131 --> 00:36:33.432]  I had a similar thing happen.
[00:36:33.432 --> 00:36:49.869]  You know, when you really do things in this world, you start to learn how rigged they are, and it's just crazy to see them go, even though it's the same newscast, the Russians are rigging the election, we're having to bring in the UN to oversee it, and then meanwhile, Trump's crazy, he says they're rigging the election even as we catch election officials admitting the fraud.
[00:36:49.869 --> 00:36:51.711]  We do have a minute or two more if you've got it.
[00:36:51.711 --> 00:36:52.732]  Elaborate on what you're saying.
[00:36:52.932 --> 00:36:53.392]  I mean, I agree.
[00:36:53.392 --> 00:36:57.195]  The internal polls, I know from Trump, but also other big groups are doing internal polls.
[00:36:57.195 --> 00:36:59.597]  5, 10, 15 points ahead in most battleground states.
[00:36:59.597 --> 00:37:01.078]  He's going to win in a landslide.
[00:37:01.078 --> 00:37:04.800]  They're only creating a perception he's way behind, so we buy it right now.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.861]  Do you concur with that?
[00:37:05.861 --> 00:37:07.482]  A. B. What happens when he gets in?
[00:37:07.482 --> 00:37:08.583]  100% right.
[00:37:08.583 --> 00:37:09.743]  You and I think the same way.
[00:37:09.743 --> 00:37:11.865]  I said to Donald yesterday on my radio show, I said,
[00:37:13.793 --> 00:37:18.797]  Donald, I said what they're doing is they're not trying to get people to vote for Hillary.
[00:37:18.797 --> 00:37:21.538]  They've got all the people they could ever, ever get.
[00:37:21.538 --> 00:37:26.962]  I said what they're trying to do is discourage Trump voters from voting by thinking that it's over already.
[00:37:26.962 --> 00:37:29.584]  They're trying to make them think that he lost, that she won.
[00:37:29.584 --> 00:37:32.286]  So they're going to throw their hands up and not vote for him.
[00:37:32.286 --> 00:37:35.668]  I said this whole election hinges upon one thing right now.
[00:37:35.668 --> 00:37:36.809]  Voter turnout.
[00:37:37.662 --> 00:37:41.307]  The black people are not turning out for Hillary, they don't like her.
[00:37:41.307 --> 00:37:44.732]  The Hispanic people are really not that excited about Hillary Clinton.
[00:37:44.732 --> 00:37:45.653]  He has no crowds!
[00:37:46.673 --> 00:37:51.315]  And it's the Hispanic men have always liked Trump, as I said six months ago, for a number of reasons.
[00:37:51.315 --> 00:37:55.056]  One, most of them come here to work very hard to become an American.
[00:37:55.056 --> 00:37:56.256]  They have their wives and their children.
[00:37:56.256 --> 00:37:57.757]  They want a house with a picket fence.
[00:37:57.757 --> 00:38:01.138]  They look at Donald Trump as a man they'd like to be like, not a man they hate.
[00:38:01.138 --> 00:38:03.759]  They look at her and they say, ugh, whatever.
[00:38:03.759 --> 00:38:06.040]  So it's all voter turnout.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:09.501]  He's got to make sure that people think he can still win, which he can.
[00:38:09.501 --> 00:38:15.523]  And then if all of us who are supporting him come out, I think he will win.
[00:38:15.523 --> 00:38:16.183]  It's that simple.
[00:38:16.363 --> 00:38:16.703]  That's right.
[00:38:16.703 --> 00:38:17.944]  You can't steal landslides.
[00:38:17.944 --> 00:38:22.467]  I've interviewed experts who are Democrats, Republicans, die-bold engineers from the highest levels.
[00:38:22.467 --> 00:38:23.568]  They agree.
[00:38:23.568 --> 00:38:27.831]  You cannot steal a landslide because it is cobbled together, how the systems work.
[00:38:27.831 --> 00:38:29.252]  And the battleground states are key.
[00:38:29.252 --> 00:38:32.874]  We'll be obviously listening to Savage Nation with Michael Savage.
[00:38:32.874 --> 00:38:35.996]  That comes on in just a few hours and we'll obviously be following.
[00:38:35.996 --> 00:38:39.699]  We have full election coverage tomorrow night live with the debates.
[00:38:39.699 --> 00:38:42.180]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:45.122]  MichaelSavage.com, the new book Scorched Earth.
[00:38:45.122 --> 00:38:46.223]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:38:47.063 --> 00:38:48.504]  Always the best, Alex.
[00:38:48.504 --> 00:38:49.604]  Watch your back.
[00:38:49.604 --> 00:38:50.885]  You too, absolutely.
[00:38:50.885 --> 00:38:56.547]  And again, a lot of people on talk radio can't believe that I have other talk show hosts on or he's had me on his show and has some of our reporters on.
[00:38:56.547 --> 00:38:58.288]  We just want to save the country, folks.
[00:38:58.288 --> 00:39:00.409]  Michael Savage has had hundreds of best-selling books.
[00:39:00.409 --> 00:39:02.049]  I think it's over a hundred.
[00:39:02.049 --> 00:39:06.271]  Three or four, number one, you know, he doesn't need the money.
[00:39:06.271 --> 00:39:08.332]  His family, he's very successful in business.
[00:39:08.332 --> 00:39:09.813]  I don't need the money.
[00:39:09.813 --> 00:39:10.813]  I don't want to do this.
[00:39:10.813 --> 00:39:12.814]  I don't want to take on mass murderer Hillary Clinton.
[00:39:13.314 --> 00:39:14.755]  But I've got to if there's no damn future.
[00:39:14.755 --> 00:39:24.180]  And I see these other arrogant talk show hosts that just, they just love attacking other hosts, they love trying to be number one, having these pissing contests.
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.081]  I don't want to lose my Second Amendment.
[00:39:26.081 --> 00:39:30.283]  I don't want to lose what little private property rights we have, and religious rights.
[00:39:30.283 --> 00:39:35.545]  And I don't want to live in a country overrun by a bunch of people wearing hoods over their heads that keep women as slaves.
[00:39:35.545 --> 00:39:38.007]  And it's, for me it's total ideology.
[00:39:38.707 --> 00:39:42.288]  And there's only one other host nationally that gets it, and that's Michael Savage.
[00:39:42.288 --> 00:39:45.590]  And that's what's so refreshing about it, and that's why we've got to fight.
[00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:52.452]  You've got Drudge Report over there as well telling the truth, Rightmark doing it, and they're saying, oh, the media, the right-wing media is getting more radical.
[00:39:52.452 --> 00:39:54.233]  No, we're getting more awake, okay?
[00:39:54.233 --> 00:39:58.995]  We're facing a world government takeover by private corporate megabanks.
[00:40:01.946 --> 00:40:03.487]  It's in all the WikiLeaks.
[00:40:03.487 --> 00:40:07.069]  They say their philosophy's making us poor to control us.
[00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:09.410]  That's called slavery, people!
[00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:10.930]  I'm anti-slavery.
[00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:12.991]  And I'm angry.
[00:40:12.991 --> 00:40:13.972]  And we're in a crisis.
[00:40:17.597 --> 00:40:20.058]  And I just look at these criminals on TV laughing at us.
[00:40:20.058 --> 00:40:22.158]  All these people that wrote Obamacare, they go on TV and laugh at us.
[00:40:22.158 --> 00:40:25.959]  And they go on C-SPAN and Charlie Rose and CNN and laugh at us.
[00:40:25.959 --> 00:40:28.540]  It's like, man, it's time you get your teeth knocked out.
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:32.821]  I mean, I'm not a violent person, but politically, I mean, that is a metaphor.
[00:40:32.821 --> 00:40:35.982]  I want to take a baseball bat to their teeth.
[00:40:35.982 --> 00:40:39.163]  These people are bullies that have never been checked.
[00:40:39.163 --> 00:40:40.363]  It's exactly what Savage said.
[00:40:40.363 --> 00:40:42.364]  Now, our next guest,
[00:40:45.361 --> 00:40:46.602]  Is giving us this exclusive today.
[00:40:46.602 --> 00:40:55.469]  There's only been one other short interview, but this is an official interview with Tracy Martin on record, who was the travel chef for the Clintons.
[00:40:55.469 --> 00:40:58.571]  They were traveling at the time, so one of their main chefs on record.
[00:40:58.571 --> 00:41:03.735]  Senior partner at Burns Martin and associates of culinary staffing and events management firm.
[00:41:03.735 --> 00:41:05.857]  And people will pay for a lot coming out and doing this.
[00:41:05.857 --> 00:41:06.658]  There's a lot of courage.
[00:41:06.658 --> 00:41:07.398]  People die for this.
[00:41:07.398 --> 00:41:10.161]  Their other chef got killed just last year.
[00:41:10.161 --> 00:41:10.901]  He was executive
[00:41:12.182 --> 00:41:18.129]  Sue Chef for the Catering at the Kennedy Center, Performing Arts and Travel Chef in the Clinton White House.
[00:41:18.129 --> 00:41:22.934]  He worked in private services for Mrs. Robert Kennedy and other members of the family.
[00:41:22.934 --> 00:41:26.598]  So by going public here, folks, he's flushing all this, but he wants you to know the truth.
[00:41:26.598 --> 00:41:27.078]  This is a hero.
[00:41:27.939 --> 00:41:36.368]  He cut along the staffing agency Wolf, Martin & Associates and owned and operated a movable feast catering company in Chattanooga.
[00:41:36.368 --> 00:41:40.752]  And after all this, folks, you need to hire his company because he's not going to get any business from the Blue Bloods.
[00:41:40.752 --> 00:41:43.214]  He studied culinary arts in Europe at Le Cordon Bleu.
[00:41:43.214 --> 00:41:44.516]  I'm not going to go through it all.
[00:41:44.516 --> 00:41:48.039]  He's a top chef, obviously, and he has
[00:41:49.093 --> 00:41:52.894]  Put on parties and work for Margaret Thatcher, Helmut Kohl, President George H.W.
[00:41:52.894 --> 00:41:56.615]  Bush, Ronald Reagan, the Chinese President.
[00:41:56.615 --> 00:41:57.615]  It goes on and on.
[00:41:57.615 --> 00:41:58.995]  Boris Yeltsin, you name it.
[00:41:58.995 --> 00:42:01.476]  He's one of the top chefs in the world.
[00:42:01.476 --> 00:42:02.456]  He joins us.
[00:42:02.456 --> 00:42:04.096]  I'm going to talk about why he's having to do this.
[00:42:04.096 --> 00:42:10.237]  This is amazing because, again, it's one thing if you're an independent talk show host to tell the truth and get the threats and stuff.
[00:42:10.237 --> 00:42:15.298]  But, man, when your job is feeding the elite and the rest of it, it's amazing.
[00:42:15.298 --> 00:42:17.099]  Tracy Martin, we appreciate your courage.
[00:42:17.099 --> 00:42:18.159]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[00:42:19.056 --> 00:42:21.477]  Well, thank you.
[00:42:21.477 --> 00:42:22.297]  Where does it start?
[00:42:22.297 --> 00:42:25.879]  I mean, what takes you to this point of having to do this, sir?
[00:42:25.879 --> 00:42:46.128]  Well, I feel like it's my moral obligation as a concerned citizen, as a taxpayer, having seen what went on with their administration, how this woman has sat on every side of the issue and still can sit there and tell us, you know, what she wants us to believe.
[00:42:48.326 --> 00:43:00.874]  It just came to a point where I was courted by Tom Barley for quite some time to come forward, and I hadn't, but Tom Barley sort of broke the story open on his show, and it just sort of went from there.
[00:43:00.874 --> 00:43:02.455]  Wow.
[00:43:02.455 --> 00:43:09.639]  Well, again, being one of their executive chefs worldwide and other world leaders for many, many years, and, you know, obviously, I mean, close to him specifically.
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:11.981]  Why are you going public?
[00:43:11.981 --> 00:43:13.562]  What did you witness Hillary Clinton do?
[00:43:13.562 --> 00:43:28.591]  I had former Secret Service agent Burns on yesterday who said that he saw and heard disparaging marks towards Hispanics by her, but he wanted to say she was mean and nasty to everyone, including hitting Secret Service agents in the back of the head with Bibles and things.
[00:43:28.591 --> 00:43:31.653]  Describe what you witnessed, sir.
[00:43:31.653 --> 00:43:35.576]  Well, first of all, with Mrs. Clinton, if
[00:43:36.556 --> 00:43:49.999]  You know, what I used to say when I could talk, when I couldn't talk, is that, you know, no matter where we went, she'd come in, she'd be grateful, say thanks, thank you to the back of the house, people in the kitchen, etc.
[00:43:49.999 --> 00:43:52.060]  But that was always if there was press around.
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:55.821]  She's a completely different person when the camera's not on her.
[00:43:57.046 --> 00:43:58.227]  And I ran into an incident.
[00:43:58.227 --> 00:44:25.346]  I was at the Elizabeth Taylor Medical Center in Washington, D.C., and we were doing a tea with Mrs. Chirac, the former French President's wife, and it was just Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Chirac, and myself in the same room, and one of the people brought in something, and it did not please her, and she used the N-word very openly to me, and I think that's
[00:44:26.129 --> 00:44:28.550]  That's a general pattern when they talk like that.
[00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:34.674]  It's not like they say it just, you know, out of the clear blue.
[00:44:34.674 --> 00:44:42.059]  Again, former top chefs of the Clintons, Mr. Martin, can you walk through specifically what was happening in the conversation, what was said?
[00:44:42.059 --> 00:44:45.901]  Well, what had happened with the conversation is
[00:44:47.098 --> 00:44:51.319]  I was just, like I said, Mrs. Chirac, Mrs. Clinton, and myself in there.
[00:44:51.319 --> 00:44:53.280]  I was just serving them tea.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:57.260]  As a travel chef, I did not do stuff in the White House.
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:59.021]  I did stuff outside of the White House.
[00:44:59.021 --> 00:44:59.601]  We went places.
[00:44:59.601 --> 00:45:03.022]  You were their travel chef, continue.
[00:45:03.022 --> 00:45:10.283]  So she brought, we had somebody bring in something, I think it was like some tea sandwiches or whatever, and it wasn't exactly what she wanted.
[00:45:10.283 --> 00:45:12.484]  So she tells me to tell that in.
[00:45:13.616 --> 00:45:17.840]  Edward to please, you know, leave and get what she wants.
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.321]  I mean, that's very common.
[00:45:19.321 --> 00:45:30.551]  I mean, just the demeanor and, you know, and, you know, she would write things down like that to, you know.
[00:45:30.551 --> 00:45:39.419]  She has so many handlers and when I work when I work for them in Washington, I used to think to myself, you know, because it's the parties aside.
[00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:41.491]  I thought, you know, this is great.
[00:45:41.491 --> 00:45:48.075]  I'm a kid that grew up on a small farm in Chautauqua County, and here I am working for the free leader of the world.
[00:45:48.075 --> 00:45:55.901]  So you sort of out, you know, you don't look at this other small stuff, and then one day you realize, you know, they're really terrible people.
[00:45:59.184 --> 00:46:01.627]  Wow, so just be clear Tracy Martin.
[00:46:01.627 --> 00:46:03.769]  She's going to do us any better.
[00:46:03.769 --> 00:46:15.521]  I mean she tells us one thing, she does something totally opposite, and now with all the WikiLeaks information coming out, everything that I've said for the last few years is all proven.
[00:46:15.521 --> 00:46:17.983]  Just like Donald Trump has said, it's all coming out.
[00:46:18.942 --> 00:46:24.564]  So you've last few years talked to folks about this, but now you're starting to go on air because it's being backed up by the WikiLeaks now.
[00:46:24.564 --> 00:46:28.246]  Again, the executive chef when they were worldwide travel, Tracy Martin, joins us.
[00:46:28.246 --> 00:46:34.788]  He's on record doing these events for years and other presidents have just tuned in.
[00:46:34.788 --> 00:46:36.329]  Please elaborate, or did I hear you wrong?
[00:46:36.329 --> 00:46:42.071]  Did you say that she even did handwritten letters sometimes saying n-word this, n-word that?
[00:46:42.071 --> 00:46:42.972]  Did I hear you say?
[00:46:42.972 --> 00:46:45.353]  That is definitely correct.
[00:46:45.353 --> 00:46:46.193]  Please elaborate, sir.
[00:46:47.421 --> 00:46:56.624]  Well, you know, a lot of times because they have so many handlers and everything, they just scratch things down on paper just because you need to be quiet.
[00:46:56.624 --> 00:46:57.885]  There's a lot of people around.
[00:46:57.885 --> 00:46:58.705]  Just take care of this.
[00:46:58.705 --> 00:46:59.805]  No, that's what lawyers do.
[00:46:59.805 --> 00:47:02.006]  She's a lawyer, so she's writing notes, handing them to you.
[00:47:02.006 --> 00:47:04.127]  What'd she write?
[00:47:04.127 --> 00:47:07.868]  Oh, I shouldn't do... I mean, without, you know, like, tell that...
[00:47:09.668 --> 00:47:17.621]  I mean, Edward, you know, that I don't need them, or to go out, or you know, whatever, or that, you know, she could say that bitch over there, or whatever.
[00:47:17.621 --> 00:47:20.065]  I mean, when you'd want to say that, you.
[00:47:22.585 --> 00:47:24.366]  Well, that's what I've talked to Secret Service and others.
[00:47:24.366 --> 00:47:27.587]  They say she goes out of her way to attack everyone.
[00:47:27.587 --> 00:47:33.109]  And if it's Hispanic, it'll be a Hispanic prerogative, you know, a slang term, disparaging term.
[00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:35.010]  If it's a black person, white person, they'll do it.
[00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:36.371]  If it's a woman, it's a bitch.
[00:47:36.371 --> 00:47:41.133]  If it's a man, it's a... What other type of things did she write or say to you over the years?
[00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:46.674]  I think in general, it's just her condescending attitude.
[00:47:46.674 --> 00:47:50.037]  Because the Clintons, no matter what, they are a machine.
[00:47:50.037 --> 00:47:53.181]  They're not a couple.
[00:47:53.181 --> 00:47:59.267]  When he was running for office, he said, we are in a partnership.
[00:47:59.267 --> 00:48:01.350]  All it is, is a money machine.
[00:48:03.012 --> 00:48:06.895]  It has been that way since day one, and it's still that way 30 years later.
[00:48:06.895 --> 00:48:11.959]  Well, I've talked to Secret Service agents on and off the record, and they say it's like she doesn't have a real personality.
[00:48:11.959 --> 00:48:15.482]  There's either this fake one that's very charming, or this crazy, hateful one.
[00:48:15.482 --> 00:48:19.545]  But I've talked to other military people, and I brought up the Secret Service and said, how do you know that?
[00:48:19.545 --> 00:48:22.848]  And they didn't want me to even go there, because it sounds so nuts.
[00:48:22.848 --> 00:48:25.670]  They think they'll be discrediting, but I'll just say it.
[00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:27.972]  They say Hillary almost like switches off.
[00:48:27.972 --> 00:48:29.714]  She'll go, I'm going to rest now, and just go, psst.
[00:48:32.014 --> 00:48:36.757]  It was almost like, you know, don't forget you're working for the Clintons.
[00:48:36.757 --> 00:48:39.859]  That type of an attitude.
[00:48:39.859 --> 00:48:44.522]  No matter what, no matter where, it was always about the Clintons.
[00:48:44.522 --> 00:48:54.669]  And like I said in Tom Barley's interview, you know, they, just for an example, they bought that house when they left the government in Chappaqua.
[00:48:55.715 --> 00:48:57.016]  They have a secret service booth.
[00:48:57.016 --> 00:48:58.137]  They are billing the U.S.
[00:48:58.137 --> 00:49:02.681]  government rent for that secret service booth, which in turn is paying for their mortgage.
[00:49:02.681 --> 00:49:06.304]  The same thing with her large home in Washington, D.C.
[00:49:06.304 --> 00:49:10.087]  We, the government, are paying for their mortgages.
[00:49:10.087 --> 00:49:17.893]  Now, specifically... The Clinton Initiative, which is the Clinton Global Initiative, which is just a money machine for them.
[00:49:17.893 --> 00:49:22.597]  Tracy Martin, Executive Chef, when they traveled for many years, were there ever
[00:49:24.165 --> 00:49:30.413]  Any other cases where she verbally said, go tell that n-word to do this or that, because you were saying many times she would write it.
[00:49:30.413 --> 00:49:35.659]  Was it many times writing it and just once verbally or were there ever any other racial slurs you heard her say?
[00:49:35.659 --> 00:49:37.341]  No, I think verbally.
[00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:39.444]  I mean, like with Hispanics, with anybody.
[00:49:39.444 --> 00:49:42.368]  I mean, it's just, it's, they are so
[00:49:43.237 --> 00:49:47.578]  That sense of self-entitlement is so far above everybody else.
[00:49:47.578 --> 00:49:49.358]  So that's what the Secret Service said.
[00:49:49.358 --> 00:49:51.698]  They said it almost wasn't even like it was a race.
[00:49:51.698 --> 00:49:57.499]  It was just this arrogance to attack everyone and I'm better than everybody and use whatever pejorative there is.
[00:49:57.499 --> 00:49:58.640]  That's what I've been getting.
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:01.860]  So specific... Oh, absolutely 100%.
[00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:04.181]  It's there above everybody.
[00:50:04.181 --> 00:50:10.002]  And they have that so ingrained in themselves that they really believe that.
[00:50:10.002 --> 00:50:11.062]  Wow.
[00:50:11.062 --> 00:50:12.222]  What does she say about Hispanics?
[00:50:13.621 --> 00:50:20.784]  Well, you know, I just think it's not just necessarily Hispanics or African Americans, American Indians, it could be anybody.
[00:50:20.784 --> 00:50:26.327]  No, I understand she attacked everybody by whatever their bad handle was, but what did she say about Hispanics?
[00:50:26.327 --> 00:50:40.614]  Well, to me directly, I have not heard her, but I've heard people that have heard her say, you know, about Hispanics, about the way they, you know, their funny accents and the way they talk or can't they get this right or whatever.
[00:50:41.650 --> 00:50:43.412]  I mean, everything is at their convenience.
[00:50:43.412 --> 00:50:47.175]  So just an elitism, that's those dumb ass Hispanics.
[00:50:47.175 --> 00:50:53.862]  It was more of an elitism, like they weren't confident, is what you're saying?
[00:50:53.862 --> 00:50:55.403]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:50:55.403 --> 00:50:56.725]  Nobody was confident.
[00:50:56.725 --> 00:50:58.787]  I don't care if you're African American, if you're Muslim.
[00:51:00.546 --> 00:51:04.149]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?
[00:51:04.149 --> 00:51:05.991]  How would you like to never be cold again?

[00:52:02.477 --> 00:52:04.579]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.

[00:52:28.159 --> 00:52:29.160]  A true innovation.
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:31.181]  I have never seen anything like this.
[00:52:31.181 --> 00:52:32.842]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[00:52:32.842 --> 00:52:35.244]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[00:52:35.244 --> 00:52:39.326]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.

[00:52:59.289 --> 00:53:04.072]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[00:53:04.072 --> 00:53:09.955]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.

[00:54:30.339 --> 00:54:31.681]  We have other guests joining us.
[00:54:31.681 --> 00:54:33.802]  Obviously, this is a big news-making interview.
[00:54:33.802 --> 00:54:46.833]  Paul Watson has an interview up on Infowars.com breaking down Tracy Martin, the fact that he did work for the Clintons as their travel chef and has worked for other world leaders, has a lot of courage to do this and to come out.
[00:54:46.833 --> 00:54:48.054]  But this is what everyone tells me.
[00:54:48.054 --> 00:54:49.135]  You don't look her in the eyes.
[00:54:49.775 --> 00:54:50.055]  Absolutely.
[00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:19.901]  Well, you've got the floor.
[00:55:19.901 --> 00:55:21.242]  I mean, you were getting cut off by the break.
[00:55:21.242 --> 00:55:32.669]  You were just getting into the fact, basically mirroring what Mr. Burns, the Secret Service agent, said yesterday, was just that she just hated everybody, but did use the racial pejoratives.
[00:55:32.669 --> 00:55:39.753]  Well, like I said, I think that Clinton, she especially, has a sense of self-entitlement.
[00:55:39.753 --> 00:55:41.435]  She is above and beyond.
[00:55:41.435 --> 00:55:45.157]  I mean, her true belief, I think, is she's above and beyond everyone.
[00:55:45.157 --> 00:55:48.099]  She has no, I mean, she takes no
[00:55:49.113 --> 00:55:51.534]  Soliciting who she talks about, who she talks to.
[00:55:51.534 --> 00:55:57.537]  I mean, I've seen Secret Service trying to protect her and the way she downgrades her conversations to them.
[00:55:57.537 --> 00:56:00.698]  I mean, to people, to anybody.
[00:56:00.698 --> 00:56:04.159]  You mean she talks to them like they're... She covers her for everything.
[00:56:04.159 --> 00:56:07.181]  She talks to them like they're children is what you're saying?
[00:56:07.181 --> 00:56:07.961]  Pardon me?
[00:56:07.961 --> 00:56:09.862]  When you say downgrades conversation, what do you mean?
[00:56:11.075 --> 00:56:13.616]  Well, like, she downgrades them.
[00:56:13.616 --> 00:56:16.537]  I mean, because, you know, like... Oh, she puts them down.
[00:56:16.537 --> 00:56:17.258]  Give us an example.
[00:56:17.258 --> 00:56:23.260]  I know you're wanting to be polite here, but you're a guy that puts on, you know, world-famous dinners, and you're all about decor, but decorum.
[00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:24.641]  I mean, just give us an example.
[00:56:25.711 --> 00:56:36.100]  Well, I think like with Secret Service, I mean, you know, it's just like the demanding attitude, you know, we're all supposed to be subservient to them.
[00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:39.943]  They're the only people that count, ever.
[00:56:39.943 --> 00:56:50.812]  Even if we were in a, like for example, this event with Mrs. Chirac, I mean, it was like we'd have to wait for Mrs. Clinton because, you know, God forbid if she was to wait for anybody else.
[00:56:52.793 --> 00:56:54.815]  You know, Obama's done evil stuff.
[00:56:54.815 --> 00:56:55.835]  Obama's done evil stuff.
[00:56:55.835 --> 00:56:57.957]  It was always that way, and I was involved.
[00:56:57.957 --> 00:57:03.181]  At the end of my term with them was when the whole Monica thing broke loose.
[00:57:03.181 --> 00:57:11.628]  And I mean, just to see how they would, I mean, they would show up in church every Sunday, high and mighty, and here we go, because that's the way it was.
[00:57:11.628 --> 00:57:15.451]  I mean, they cannot do, they believe they do no wrong anywhere.
[00:57:15.451 --> 00:57:20.575]  Well, I was about to say, I'm not defending Obama for his record, but Secret Service people say he's real nice in person comparatively.
[00:57:21.155 --> 00:57:25.138]  And that's like, a few weeks ago in Tel Aviv, he's like, for 20 minutes, Bill's making him wait.
[00:57:25.138 --> 00:57:26.799]  He finally goes, Bill!
[00:57:26.799 --> 00:57:27.959]  Get on the plane!
[00:57:27.959 --> 00:57:33.503]  And it's like, they're so entitled to what I've heard, they just think they're God, basically.
[00:57:33.503 --> 00:57:34.664]  Absolutely.
[00:57:34.664 --> 00:57:35.684]  Absolutely.
[00:57:35.684 --> 00:57:36.765]  And no matter what.
[00:57:36.765 --> 00:57:41.728]  I mean, we were doing an event out at Hickory Hill at Mrs. Robert Kennedy's.
[00:57:41.728 --> 00:57:45.030]  This was after I was done with the Clintons.
[00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:48.753]  And we were doing, I believe it was an Easter brunch.
[00:57:49.776 --> 00:57:53.499]  And, you know, there again, you're waiting for them.
[00:57:53.499 --> 00:58:00.144]  And, you know, when you're in that position in the world, you can pretty much get away with whatever you want.
[00:58:00.144 --> 00:58:01.064]  But they enjoy it.
[00:58:01.064 --> 00:58:02.245]  They do it on purpose, is what I'm told.
[00:58:02.245 --> 00:58:04.287]  We're getting a clear picture of their psychology.
[00:58:04.287 --> 00:58:07.249]  And I'm going to get a top psychiatrist to listen to this and analyze it with other interviews.
[00:58:07.249 --> 00:58:07.810]  We're going to break.
[00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:09.050]  We've got five more minutes with you, sir.
[00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:10.812]  I'd like to have you back up soon.
[00:58:10.812 --> 00:58:11.893]  And we appreciate your courage.
[00:58:11.893 --> 00:58:12.433]  It's amazing.
[00:58:12.433 --> 00:58:14.494]  But let me ask you this question.
[00:58:14.494 --> 00:58:16.776]  Did Hillary Clinton ever have a foul odor?
[00:58:16.776 --> 00:58:19.098]  Because a lot of people we've talked to say she stunk a lot.
[00:58:22.615 --> 00:58:26.058]  I tried not to get too close.
[00:58:26.058 --> 00:58:29.360]  I just dealt with what I had to do to do my job.
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:32.222]  Did you ever hear anyone else say she had a foul odor?
[00:58:32.222 --> 00:58:35.004]  I have heard people say, you know, about her.
[00:58:35.004 --> 00:58:36.025]  Well, stay right there.
[00:58:36.025 --> 00:58:36.926]  We're going to come right back.
[00:58:36.926 --> 00:58:39.848]  Stay with us.
[00:58:39.848 --> 00:58:41.970]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:41.970 --> 00:58:42.971]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.841 --> 00:58:54.303]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:58:54.303 --> 00:59:05.247]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:59:05.407 --> 00:59:10.449]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:59:10.449 --> 00:59:13.030]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:14.751]  It helps detoxify.
[00:59:14.751 --> 00:59:17.632]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:59:17.632 --> 00:59:22.394]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:59:22.394 --> 00:59:28.657]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[00:59:28.657 --> 00:59:34.000]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:34.760]  I'm taking it now.
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:37.182]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:02.369 --> 01:00:05.110]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:10.972]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.972 --> 01:00:24.717]  Well, if you don't think Tracy Martin, the world-renowned executive, top chef, served major presidents, world leaders, you name it, and was the Clinton's travel chef, isn't putting his business, his life, his name on the line a big way.
[01:00:26.198 --> 01:00:27.859]  Well, then you're not paying attention.
[01:00:27.859 --> 01:00:28.640]  I know most of you know that.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.581]  I want to recognize his courage right now.
[01:00:30.581 --> 01:00:36.646]  And everybody else has been speaking out and telling the truth, like Secret Service Agent Burns yesterday.
[01:00:36.646 --> 01:00:38.167]  I've talked to Secret Service on and off record.
[01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:38.927]  I've talked to a lot of people.
[01:00:38.927 --> 01:00:42.930]  The reason I bring up the smell is it's part of psychological research.
[01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:44.691]  Psychopaths, sociopaths, and others
[01:00:45.532 --> 01:00:48.074]  I think, um, as I said in my Tom Burleigh's original interview,
[01:01:15.631 --> 01:01:24.794]  I feel it is my obligation because, you know, I've sat in the back pictures silent for so long, and I did pay them compliments.
[01:01:24.794 --> 01:01:28.555]  I mean, like I said, I was a kid from a small farm town.
[01:01:28.555 --> 01:01:31.235]  I found myself working in Washington, D.C.
[01:01:31.235 --> 01:01:34.056]  I'm now doing events with the leader of the free world.
[01:01:34.056 --> 01:01:40.198]  And then to find out how they really are behind the scenes, how they, I mean, between
[01:01:40.962 --> 01:01:43.925]  Yeah, I just happened to end up working for the Clintons.
[01:01:43.925 --> 01:01:56.475]  It could have been the Obamas or somebody else down the road, but you just see the total transparency of this is not the complete picture.
[01:01:56.475 --> 01:02:02.180]  And I feel like the American people need to know who she really is, who the President really is.
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:09.786]  If we get her back in office, we're dealing with a whole other Obama term, we're dealing with a whole other Bill Clinton scenario.
[01:02:11.795 --> 01:02:11.995]  Yeah.
[01:02:28.705 --> 01:02:32.208]  It is what it is, and we as people need to stop.
[01:02:32.208 --> 01:02:34.470]  I mean, we're going to see our country fall.
[01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:38.094]  We're at that point right now.
[01:02:38.094 --> 01:02:38.434]  I agree.
[01:02:38.434 --> 01:02:43.479]  They want each new initiative to fail to then give them more power because they never get held accountable.
[01:02:43.479 --> 01:02:47.003]  See, the WikiLeaks show, she wants it all to fail, brother.
[01:02:47.003 --> 01:02:48.064]  How diabolical is that?
[01:02:49.747 --> 01:02:51.268]  No, that's why.
[01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:53.029]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:54.229]  And that stuff is all true.
[01:02:54.229 --> 01:02:57.351]  I mean, it's not like they sat there and wrote it.
[01:02:57.351 --> 01:03:05.195]  No, they're confirming the FBI, the new FBI leak, the new FBI release shows that it's all confirmed.
[01:03:05.195 --> 01:03:08.736]  Trying to bribe the FBI, getting orders from some weird shadow government.
[01:03:08.736 --> 01:03:09.617]  I mean, God help us.
[01:03:09.617 --> 01:03:12.458]  That's why they picked her, though, because she's such a monster.
[01:03:12.458 --> 01:03:14.679]  She enjoys hurting little people.
[01:03:14.679 --> 01:03:15.840]  She wants to make us poor.
[01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:24.575]  Absolutely, and you can't tell me that Bill Clinton arriving on the tarmac when the Attorney General was sitting there, that was just a coincidence.
[01:03:26.687 --> 01:03:34.048]  Well, those of us that like to serve people and like hospitality and enjoy happiness, some of the best folks are chefs and cooks because they enjoy life.
[01:03:34.048 --> 01:03:36.009]  We just, and I love to cook food for my family.
[01:03:36.009 --> 01:03:37.989]  I'm not a great chef like you, but I cook a pretty damn good steak.
[01:03:37.989 --> 01:03:40.010]  Or pretty much a lot of other stuff.
[01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:41.470]  And my dad, you know, grandma has taught me how.
[01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:43.870]  But the point is, we enjoy doing that for people.
[01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:45.811]  These folks like this don't.
[01:03:45.811 --> 01:03:47.771]  They don't want to build a good economy.
[01:03:47.771 --> 01:03:48.431]  They don't.
[01:03:48.431 --> 01:03:51.952]  They get off on, they're the boss, they're in charge, and you ain't got nothing.
[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:57.302]  And they actually refer to us people as the small people.
[01:03:57.302 --> 01:03:59.583]  Oh, you heard that?
[01:03:59.583 --> 01:04:01.144]  Absolutely.
[01:04:01.144 --> 01:04:02.544]  And not just in the Clintons.
[01:04:02.544 --> 01:04:08.407]  I mean, when I worked for the Kennedys, I mean, they all refer to us as the small people.
[01:04:08.407 --> 01:04:11.268]  Yeah, well, America was about small people.
[01:04:11.268 --> 01:04:15.030]  The sense of self-entitlement is beyond.
[01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:15.650]  Good God.
[01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:16.631]  How would they describe that?
[01:04:16.631 --> 01:04:17.251]  Please, tell us.
[01:04:18.504 --> 01:04:27.190]  I think it would be just, you know, it's just in reference to, like in their demeanor talk about us, you know, the small people.
[01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:35.516]  I mean, I've heard that referred to by, you know, handlers and aides over the past, you know, what about, you know, to get somebody to do this or whatever.
[01:04:37.651 --> 01:04:42.134]  It's so far above the way you treat people.
[01:04:42.134 --> 01:04:43.035]  It's in the new WikiLeaks.
[01:04:43.035 --> 01:04:46.137]  They say we got to keep the general public, the small people, dumb.
[01:04:46.137 --> 01:04:48.219]  Wow, we appreciate your courage, Tracy Martin.
[01:04:48.219 --> 01:04:51.241]  Please come back on The Daily News or for a longer interview.
[01:04:51.241 --> 01:04:53.583]  We want to support you and pray for you and hold you up in prayer.
[01:04:53.583 --> 01:04:55.385]  God bless you, sir.
[01:04:55.385 --> 01:04:56.485]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:04:56.485 --> 01:04:57.406]  Have a good day.
[01:04:57.406 --> 01:04:58.187]  Guy's risking his life.
[01:05:00.149 --> 01:05:07.857]  The Japanese coastline has been struck again and the Fukushima reactor cooling system, it stops flowing amid the quake and tsunami that followed.
[01:05:07.857 --> 01:05:11.781]  Damaged nuclear planet struggles after this latest natural disaster.
[01:05:11.781 --> 01:05:19.749]  Now the cooling system of the third reactor at the Fukushima nuclear plant has stopped circulating water following a powerful 7.3 offshore earthquake.
[01:05:20.289 --> 01:05:33.012]  Tepco said that it managed to restart the system some 90 minutes after its failure, and the cooling system servicing the Unit 3 spent fuel pool was not able to circulate water to cool nuclear fuel because of a broken pump.
[01:05:33.012 --> 01:05:35.813]  All of this is according to the Nuclear Regulatory Agency.
[01:05:35.813 --> 01:05:45.915]  It turns out that this plant for the second time has been hit, and the immediate danger, although the agency admitted gradual rising temperatures, the exact cause of this cooling system stoppage
[01:05:46.015 --> 01:05:47.277]  That is currently unknown.
[01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:49.139]  Now, we've highlighted this on InfoWars.
[01:05:49.139 --> 01:05:54.727]  Please check out our reports for more information regarding this latest quake and how it impacts the days coming forward.
[01:05:54.727 --> 01:05:57.331]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:05:59.932 --> 01:06:02.573]  I want to tell you about a brand new off-the-grid product.
[01:06:02.573 --> 01:06:04.733]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[01:06:04.733 --> 01:06:10.454]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110 appliances at your house.
[01:06:10.454 --> 01:06:13.555]  Like small refrigerators to keep your food from spoiling.
[01:06:13.555 --> 01:06:16.076]  The best part though, you can take it with you.
[01:06:16.076 --> 01:06:16.776]  It's mobile.
[01:06:16.776 --> 01:06:21.477]  To jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[01:06:21.937 --> 01:06:25.658]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity.
[01:06:25.658 --> 01:06:29.100]  Basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:30.100]  A true innovation.
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:32.201]  I have never seen anything like this.
[01:06:32.201 --> 01:06:33.901]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[01:06:33.901 --> 01:06:36.442]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[01:06:36.442 --> 01:06:38.163]  It's even a great Christmas idea.
[01:06:38.343 --> 01:06:42.705]  If you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid, go to privatepowergrid.com.
[01:06:42.705 --> 01:06:44.746]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[01:06:44.746 --> 01:06:45.527]  And check this out.

[01:06:56.252 --> 01:06:57.693]  Limited one per household.
[01:06:57.693 --> 01:06:59.794]  privatepowergrid.com.
[01:06:59.794 --> 01:07:03.296]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things
[01:07:03.456 --> 01:07:03.916]  We're good to go.
[01:07:23.772 --> 01:07:28.436]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:07:28.436 --> 01:07:34.962]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:07:34.962 --> 01:07:42.749]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:07:42.749 --> 01:07:49.955]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature in InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[01:07:49.955 --> 01:07:50.756]  10% off on auto ship.
[01:07:50.916 --> 01:07:53.338]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:53.338 --> 01:07:55.319]  Free shipping on orders above 50 bucks.
[01:07:55.319 --> 01:08:10.589]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:08:10.589 --> 01:08:13.992]  It's Tuesday, October 18th, 2016.
[01:08:13.992 --> 01:08:16.814]  Only 20 days to the general election.
[01:08:16.814 --> 01:08:20.256]  The energy levels are so high, you could cut it with a knife.
[01:08:26.556 --> 01:08:27.380]  How many guns?
[01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:28.928]  I'd say about 20 guns.
[01:08:28.928 --> 01:08:30.676]  Some on the surface, some on the towers.
[01:08:31.819 --> 01:08:35.602]  It's quite a time to be alive right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:35.602 --> 01:08:39.386]  Trump is ahead in internal polls, 5 to 15 points.
[01:08:39.386 --> 01:08:41.627]  Of course, you heard it confirmed a few days ago.
[01:08:41.627 --> 01:08:43.649]  I'm just not going to give out any inside baseball.
[01:08:43.649 --> 01:08:58.422]  But they know election fraud's coming because they've seen Bloomberg, Reuters, all the major polling, Politico, having Hillary 5 to 10 points ahead by sampling, in some cases, more, generally right below, double Democrats.
[01:08:59.187 --> 01:09:01.589]  Then they sample Republicans.
[01:09:01.589 --> 01:09:04.931]  I mean, this is a time to remember.
[01:09:04.931 --> 01:09:06.012]  This is unbelievable.
[01:09:06.012 --> 01:09:08.114]  We've had Michael Savage on.
[01:09:08.114 --> 01:09:09.335]  We've had Tracy Martin on.
[01:09:09.335 --> 01:09:11.076]  He's only done one other interview.
[01:09:11.076 --> 01:09:13.257]  And that's because his friend talked him into going on the air.
[01:09:13.257 --> 01:09:17.420]  That is the on-record executive sesh on the travel details for years for the Clintons.
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:18.922]  But back to Ronald Reagan, you name it.
[01:09:19.707 --> 01:09:29.072]  Putting his whole big executive business on the line to tell the truth, because he said they called people little people, they called Hispanics names, he heard them call black people the N-word.
[01:09:29.072 --> 01:09:35.455]  You tell that N-word, get me this dessert right now, you... And then she'd write notes way more than what she heard, like, you know, lawyers do that.
[01:09:35.455 --> 01:09:37.876]  You don't talk in the courtroom, she's always writing notes.
[01:09:37.876 --> 01:09:44.359]  You tell that piece of crap, get me this... I mean, just, this is a monster!
[01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:47.621]  The Clintons were putting power in Arkansas by the KKK, people!
[01:09:49.104 --> 01:09:52.645]  Do you know who was running things in the 70s and 80s in Arkansas?
[01:09:52.645 --> 01:09:54.645]  In East Texas?
[01:09:54.645 --> 01:09:55.706]  In Louisiana?
[01:09:55.706 --> 01:09:56.986]  Mississippi?
[01:09:56.986 --> 01:09:58.867]  The KKK.
[01:09:58.867 --> 01:10:00.007]  And it's come out, folks.
[01:10:00.007 --> 01:10:03.788]  I mean, it's just, it makes my head spin.
[01:10:03.788 --> 01:10:07.989]  But look, people that watch TV think the KKK is running around in white outfits in front of black people.
[01:10:07.989 --> 01:10:08.429]  They do that.
[01:10:08.429 --> 01:10:13.371]  They're mainly about running banks and running white farmers out and, you know, taking people's property.
[01:10:13.371 --> 01:10:14.851]  They're just a gang of scum.
[01:10:16.084 --> 01:10:25.928]  Now we're going to go to our guest here and we've got a big Haiti report with Joe Biggs and others coming in here at the bottom of the hour that is just so incredible that I don't even know words to describe it.
[01:10:25.928 --> 01:10:27.789]  We have people dying on tape.
[01:10:27.789 --> 01:10:29.490]  We're in there with aid missions coming in.
[01:10:29.490 --> 01:10:33.651]  The UN won't fly people out that are dying to Port-au-Prince just 30 minutes away.
[01:10:33.651 --> 01:10:36.553]  No one ever got any Clinton aid.
[01:10:36.553 --> 01:10:38.773]  You say Clinton there, it's like you said Satan.
[01:10:38.773 --> 01:10:39.754]  Everybody flips out.
[01:10:40.933 --> 01:10:46.895]  The big report's coming tomorrow, but Gary Haben, the billionaire philanthropist, is going to be joining us via, from I think it's Port-au-Prince, via Skype.
[01:10:46.895 --> 01:10:48.075]  We'll see if it's working.
[01:10:48.075 --> 01:10:48.776]  That's all coming up.
[01:10:48.776 --> 01:10:50.876]  We're going to talk to Joel Gilbert here briefly.
[01:10:50.876 --> 01:10:58.019]  He was instrumental in helping do some of the research and background work and helping get Danny Williams' video out.
[01:10:58.019 --> 01:10:59.779]  So that's very, very exciting to have that going on.
[01:10:59.779 --> 01:11:01.960]  Just briefly, I skipped a break last hour.
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:02.740]  I didn't plug once.
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:07.302]  And they're in there telling me, Alex, we're not going to have money to pay the bills if you don't sell stuff.
[01:11:08.283 --> 01:11:09.384]  We're self-supported.
[01:11:09.384 --> 01:11:18.115]  We sell the best seeds, the best products, the best shortwave radios, the best storable foods, the best nutraceuticals out there, the best films, you name it.
[01:11:18.115 --> 01:11:22.440]  And we've got free shipping running for the big final showdown tomorrow, right through tomorrow.
[01:11:23.476 --> 01:11:24.997]  It's gonna end on Thursday.
[01:11:24.997 --> 01:11:27.239]  Storewide at infowarestore.com.
[01:11:27.239 --> 01:11:31.062]  And we have 25% off our new Tropic Brain Force.
[01:11:31.062 --> 01:11:31.782]  22 bucks, folks.
[01:11:31.782 --> 01:11:34.064]  Leading competitors with similar formulas are $50, $60.
[01:11:34.064 --> 01:11:36.145]  We sell it for 30-something.
[01:11:36.145 --> 01:11:36.706]  It's a great deal. $22.46.
[01:11:39.622 --> 01:11:42.846]  We just put in the computer 25% off when it comes up with all these weird numbers.
[01:11:42.846 --> 01:11:44.448]  Huge reviews all over the place.
[01:11:44.448 --> 01:11:44.949]  Amazing.
[01:11:44.949 --> 01:11:47.272]  Healthy way to boost your cognitive ability.
[01:11:47.272 --> 01:11:48.313]  It's amazing what it does.
[01:11:48.313 --> 01:11:50.696]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:11:50.696 --> 01:11:51.957]  Go read the reviews.
[01:11:51.957 --> 01:11:54.601]  They're so crazy that I'm not even going to read them on air.
[01:11:54.601 --> 01:11:55.942]  I mean, I guess you read a few.
[01:11:55.942 --> 01:11:56.423]  Here's a...
[01:11:57.444 --> 01:12:02.666]  One Dutch from Los Angeles would recommend this especially to my fellow truck drivers who spend time mostly on the road.
[01:12:02.666 --> 01:12:04.326]  Highly recommend this to my family and friends.
[01:12:04.326 --> 01:12:06.847]  25% off right now and free shipping.
[01:12:06.847 --> 01:12:13.110]  Brain Force allows me to get through my busy work days while staying energized and maintaining mental energy to function better than I ever have.
[01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:15.630]  Also helps me stay awake through the nights.
[01:12:15.630 --> 01:12:20.052]  I had the folks not even give us the incredible reviews about what salesmen are doing on it and the rest of it.
[01:12:20.052 --> 01:12:22.133]  That's Ricky B. in Rochester, Minnesota.
[01:12:23.143 --> 01:12:24.305]  So, take advantage.
[01:12:24.305 --> 01:12:27.949]  The last run of the Hillary for Prison shirt is out right now.
[01:12:27.949 --> 01:12:31.714]  It's still a bestseller, but we're just saying what comes and goes, that's it.
[01:12:31.714 --> 01:12:34.217]  We coined the term, and it's $9.95.
[01:12:34.217 --> 01:12:35.559]  That's at cost, free shipping.
[01:12:36.991 --> 01:12:39.953]  We also have the limited edition Don't Tread On Me Lock Her Up shirt.
[01:12:39.953 --> 01:12:41.134]  Only one printing of that.
[01:12:41.134 --> 01:12:42.495]  That's almost sold out.
[01:12:42.495 --> 01:12:43.175]  Made in America.
[01:12:43.175 --> 01:12:43.255]  $22.
[01:12:43.255 --> 01:12:44.956]  We make like 12 bucks on it.
[01:12:44.956 --> 01:12:46.878]  We need the money to fund the operation.
[01:12:46.878 --> 01:12:48.759]  Please take advantage of it.
[01:12:48.759 --> 01:12:50.400]  And free shipping, store wide.
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:55.724]  Infowarsstore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:12:55.724 --> 01:12:58.826]  But if it's water filtration systems, whether it's
[01:12:59.994 --> 01:13:01.575]  Reverse osmosis or gravity fed.
[01:13:01.575 --> 01:13:08.919]  We go out and find the very best out there, highest rated, lowest price, buy them in bulk, sell it at prices lower than Amazon in many cases.
[01:13:08.919 --> 01:13:10.640]  But sometimes Amazon does better than us.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:13.722]  Shop with us because we will viciously fight for freedom.
[01:13:13.722 --> 01:13:16.063]  We will viciously affect change.
[01:13:16.063 --> 01:13:18.765]  We will attack the globalists.
[01:13:18.765 --> 01:13:19.965]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[01:13:19.965 --> 01:13:22.207]  You couldn't drag me off this fight.
[01:13:22.207 --> 01:13:22.507]  I'm like a
[01:13:24.502 --> 01:13:26.644]  Pitbull, they breed for attacking wild hogs or something.
[01:13:26.644 --> 01:13:27.885]  Please don't tell me I'm a hero.
[01:13:27.885 --> 01:13:29.105]  I was born for this.
[01:13:29.105 --> 01:13:30.687]  Whatever happens, I'm in the fight.
[01:13:30.687 --> 01:13:31.928]  I love it.
[01:13:31.928 --> 01:13:33.309]  This is the best thing in my life.
[01:13:33.309 --> 01:13:36.291]  So, bottom line, we just need the support.
[01:13:36.291 --> 01:13:41.375]  We need the mid-air refueling, the products you need to fund this operation.
[01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:46.638]  I absolutely pledge to you, I will tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth.
[01:13:46.638 --> 01:13:49.280]  I will assault the enemy 18 hours a day.
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:53.584]  I will pray before I go to bed every night that I'd be lifted up as a weapon against the enemy.
[01:13:54.264 --> 01:13:56.245]  Now, Joel Gilbert's our guest.
[01:13:56.245 --> 01:13:57.986]  We really appreciate the work he's doing.
[01:13:57.986 --> 01:14:04.209]  He, of course, streams My Real Father and the Utopia Dystopia film about communism.
[01:14:04.209 --> 01:14:05.249]  Boy, all that's coming out.
[01:14:05.249 --> 01:14:09.371]  I want to get into what happened with Bill Clinton's, who I believe, illegitimate son.
[01:14:09.371 --> 01:14:10.392]  They're really trying to cover that up.
[01:14:10.672 --> 01:14:12.213]  But first I want to talk to him about WikiLeaks.
[01:14:12.213 --> 01:14:16.775]  Does this not prove everything Joel Gilbert from JoelGilbert.net has broken down?
[01:14:16.775 --> 01:14:25.680]  The shadow government running them, trying to bribe FBI agents, knowing they were destroying classified documents and hiding them.
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.220]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:33.664]  And to watch the media try to unify even more to prop her up, even if they steal the election where she gets in.
[01:14:34.344 --> 01:14:37.127]  These are political death blows, Joel Gilbert.
[01:14:37.127 --> 01:14:45.376]  I mean, no wonder they say they openly want to shut down the alt-right and demonize me by name, because they are just floundering, in my view.
[01:14:45.376 --> 01:14:45.897]  What do you think?
[01:14:47.651 --> 01:15:06.688]  I think, look, they're clearly floundering, they clearly put together this assault on Donald Trump week by week knowing that they could probably get their media minions to only focus on Trump and give them an excuse to completely ignore these bombshell revelations.
[01:15:07.568 --> 01:15:18.917]  The biggest one, which I think really tells the whole story, is that Hillary explicitly said that there's a public policy for everything and a private policy for everything.
[01:15:18.917 --> 01:15:28.664]  And nothing more is illustrated, even greater than in the story of Dani Williams, because she speaks affectionately for Black Lives Matter.
[01:15:29.565 --> 01:15:31.406]  But in her, that's her public life.
[01:15:31.406 --> 01:15:37.608]  In her private life, she banished her husband's child, her own stepson, from her family.
[01:15:37.608 --> 01:15:45.611]  And so we know that when Hillary says black lives matter, and she feels for them, she's really thinking black votes matter.
[01:15:46.471 --> 01:15:48.133]  And like everything else... Well, exactly.
[01:15:48.133 --> 01:15:51.337]  You said this five, six years ago that she's a sociopath, only goes off poles.
[01:15:51.337 --> 01:15:52.178]  And who is she?
[01:15:52.178 --> 01:15:54.300]  Because it's almost like she has multiple personalities.
[01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:55.381]  You've talked to a lot of experts.
[01:15:55.381 --> 01:15:57.123]  You've been on the trail, Jill Gilbert.
[01:15:57.123 --> 01:15:58.044]  Who is she really?
[01:15:58.044 --> 01:15:59.987]  What is her psychological profile?
[01:16:01.138 --> 01:16:08.607]  Her psychological profile is that she really is a Chicago radical, just like Barack Obama.
[01:16:08.607 --> 01:16:14.414]  She had a Bill Ayers figure in her life, which was Carl Oglesby, the head of the SDS.
[01:16:14.414 --> 01:16:18.019]  She read his book, Containment and Change, and wrote about that.
[01:16:18.019 --> 01:16:19.120]  She was pen pals with Saul Alinsky.
[01:16:19.801 --> 01:16:23.523]  Not only Pen Pal, she met Saul Alinsky, he offered her a job.
[01:16:23.523 --> 01:16:28.285]  She said that rather than work for him on the outside, she wants to affect change from the inside.
[01:16:28.285 --> 01:16:33.448]  Her thesis, her college thesis was about Saul Alinsky.
[01:16:33.448 --> 01:16:36.690]  While becoming a filthy rich pig that steals money from Haitian children.
[01:16:37.287 --> 01:16:38.528]  Right, there can only be one fight.
[01:16:38.528 --> 01:16:41.431]  So she is at her core a 60s radical.
[01:16:41.431 --> 01:16:43.873]  She also had a Reverend Wright in her life.
[01:16:43.873 --> 01:16:50.880]  She had a radical minister named Don Jones, her Methodist youth minister, that introduced her to Alinsky.
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:59.868]  So she has a similar background in terms of radical theologian, radical communist, SDS ideologue.
[01:17:00.791 --> 01:17:02.773]  Way back, just like Obama had his Bill Airs.
[01:17:02.773 --> 01:17:03.534]  I totally agree.
[01:17:03.534 --> 01:17:05.997]  So, 20 days out, what do you expect them to do next?
[01:17:05.997 --> 01:17:07.258]  This huge, elaborate attack.
[01:17:07.258 --> 01:17:12.183]  Most of the women, it's turned out, were hitting on him, asking him to come visit them in emails even this year.
[01:17:12.183 --> 01:17:14.466]  It's all deteriorating.
[01:17:14.466 --> 01:17:19.972]  They contacted over a thousand women, found nine of them to say he touched their butt or touched their knee or whatever, shook their hand.
[01:17:19.972 --> 01:17:21.714]  Okay, he's evil.
[01:17:21.714 --> 01:17:22.515]  What comes next?
[01:17:23.715 --> 01:17:33.399]  Hillary's entire campaign is simply, I think, to drug her up, to get her physically across the finish line, and simply focus on that Donald Trump is a creepy guy.
[01:17:33.399 --> 01:17:34.300]  She has no justification.
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:38.202]  Oh, the way he walks around on the stage menacing her, the poor baby.
[01:17:39.056 --> 01:17:43.739]  There's no policy, there's no justification to have Hillary Clinton back in the White House.
[01:17:43.739 --> 01:17:48.022]  She has no policy of Barack Obama that she participated in that was successful.
[01:17:48.022 --> 01:17:50.044]  Everything was a dismal failure.
[01:17:50.044 --> 01:17:56.688]  All she can do is try to keep power in the Democrat Party and try to impose this era.
[01:17:57.649 --> 01:18:10.373]  This coming era of liberal fascism, which I have no doubt she will implement through radical Supreme Court justices who will defy the constitutional law and impose and create their own laws.
[01:18:10.373 --> 01:18:17.615]  So when Trump says this is make it or break it, the end of America, if he doesn't get in, I mean, barring physical resistance, this is probably it.
[01:18:18.757 --> 01:18:35.501]  I believe this is it, because once she changes the Supreme Court justice to radical leftist nominees, once she adds a seventh commissioner to the FEC to break the ties, all of those policies we've seen Obama doing behind the scenes will just come out.
[01:18:35.501 --> 01:18:36.681]  That's right, let's be clear.
[01:18:36.681 --> 01:18:42.943]  The Federal Election Commission and the FCC, they're deadlocked, are on record that if they get a majority, they're going to ban free speech.
[01:18:42.943 --> 01:18:43.383]  They admit it.
[01:18:44.421 --> 01:18:45.863]  You remember my case.
[01:18:45.863 --> 01:18:47.324]  They voted 3 to 3.
[01:18:47.324 --> 01:18:53.831]  It cut down a complaint to investigate me for making the film about Obama's real body.
[01:18:53.831 --> 01:18:56.834]  Yeah, that's how real this is, is they're trying to shut you up, a filmmaker.
[01:18:56.834 --> 01:18:58.716]  They've arrested Dinesh D'Souza.
[01:18:58.716 --> 01:18:59.137]  Good God.
[01:19:00.851 --> 01:19:01.772]  Yeah, 3 to 3.
[01:19:01.772 --> 01:19:02.893]  Now how could it be 3 to 3?
[01:19:02.893 --> 01:19:08.937]  It should be 6 to nothing that they should not be investigating a filmmaker for making a film about Obama's background.
[01:19:08.937 --> 01:19:15.863]  I presented a mountain of evidence that his real father was a Soviet agent, Frank Marshall Davis, who raised and radicalized him in his youth.
[01:19:17.023 --> 01:19:21.326]  He wrote about, in his own book, spending summers with Frank, his grandfather's best friend.
[01:19:21.326 --> 01:19:22.447]  It's hiding in plain view.
[01:19:22.447 --> 01:19:23.427]  Well, it wasn't just summers.
[01:19:23.427 --> 01:19:25.809]  It was every day he went to Frank's house.
[01:19:25.809 --> 01:19:29.451]  Frank radicalized him into this anti-American, anti-white world.
[01:19:29.451 --> 01:19:34.735]  How do they square this, though, that they make hundreds of millions of dollars in office, they live the most lavish lifestyle of kings?
[01:19:35.595 --> 01:19:39.457]  They don't want poor people to have money, but then they prance around saying they're communists.
[01:19:39.457 --> 01:19:46.301]  Well, that is the fraud, the total fraud of socialism and communism that what we have is a new class of elite.
[01:19:46.301 --> 01:19:50.243]  They eliminate the entrepreneurial class, the so-called bourgeois.
[01:19:50.243 --> 01:19:55.205]  They want to destroy the drug companies, Wall Street, the banks, all the businesses.
[01:19:55.205 --> 01:19:56.786]  The business of America is business.
[01:19:56.886 --> 01:20:04.999]  But they want to destroy business and consolidate wealth and power in their own hands, leaving a large middle class to be eliminated.
[01:20:04.999 --> 01:20:06.501]  So we only have a lower class.
[01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:08.384]  Socialist economies don't have a middle class.
[01:20:08.384 --> 01:20:09.586]  They have an upper class elite.
[01:20:10.387 --> 01:20:11.808]  And they have the poor people.
[01:20:11.808 --> 01:20:32.776]  And these are the upper class elites that are accumulating the wealth by destroying the people that make... And by the way, history with hundreds of countries is incontrovertible, that socialism and communism creates nightmare hells, even small free market experiments that never even get 10% there, create fabulous development, fabulous innovation, fabulous civilization.
[01:20:33.544 --> 01:20:38.925]  Progressives murdered 150 million of their own people during peacetime.
[01:20:38.925 --> 01:20:41.626]  As we saw in my film, There's No Place Like Utopia.
[01:20:41.626 --> 01:20:45.227]  Because they wouldn't fit into the perfect society, the perfect world.
[01:20:45.227 --> 01:20:48.088]  They didn't agree that they would conform.
[01:20:48.088 --> 01:20:51.709]  In Cambodia, they murdered anybody that had glasses.
[01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:53.849]  Because if you had glasses, you could read.
[01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:55.630]  And they wanted to recreate humanity
[01:20:56.130 --> 01:21:06.136]  I have the Zeitgeist Movement, admittedly supported by the UN and the New York Times, tell me, on air, you will be re-educated if you don't accept a computer deciding what job you have or where you live.
[01:21:06.136 --> 01:21:07.757]  I go, that's total tyranny.
[01:21:07.757 --> 01:21:10.878]  And they just arrogantly go, we're gonna run your life, we're liberal.
[01:21:10.878 --> 01:21:12.039]  Well, no, that's not liberal.
[01:21:12.039 --> 01:21:14.741]  That's called total totalitarianism, dumbass.
[01:21:15.501 --> 01:21:17.242]  I call it liberal fascism.
[01:21:17.242 --> 01:21:20.345]  If you don't conform, this is what happens throughout history.
[01:21:20.345 --> 01:21:25.429]  You get sent to the gulag, you get sent for re-education, or you're simply eliminated.
[01:21:25.429 --> 01:21:31.354]  This is a totalitarian, depressing lifestyle to have a group of elites with all the wealth
[01:21:31.934 --> 01:21:38.481]  The elites are in socialism and communism are state bureaucrats who don't produce anything.
[01:21:38.481 --> 01:21:41.043]  Therefore, you have a society that becomes impoverished.
[01:21:41.043 --> 01:21:48.931]  Today we have with a free market system, we have the entrepreneur class creating jobs and creating wealth and everybody moving up.
[01:21:48.931 --> 01:21:50.653]  Unfortunately, it seems that
[01:21:52.128 --> 01:21:55.830]  Younger people, millennials, don't know these lessons of communism and socialism.
[01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:58.592]  Oh no, they say to me, oh my god, England and Canada have such great healthcare.
[01:21:58.592 --> 01:21:59.653]  Oh, is that why it's rated horrible?
[01:21:59.653 --> 01:22:02.054]  People come here, even though ours is all corrupt and bad now?
[01:22:02.054 --> 01:22:05.656]  I mean, you know, they think North Korea's great.
[01:22:05.656 --> 01:22:06.497]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:22:08.242 --> 01:22:09.864]  We've lost this lesson in history.
[01:22:09.864 --> 01:22:12.808]  In the 60s, they mobilized all of Hollywood.
[01:22:12.808 --> 01:22:25.424]  The government would educate people, put out films, and show that, look, if you look at Mao Zedong, Stalin, all these countries, Cuba, it's political repression and poverty and death.
[01:22:26.005 --> 01:22:28.186]  And we have not had that type of education.
[01:22:28.186 --> 01:22:30.866]  So you have people going to Bernie Sanders rallies.
[01:22:30.866 --> 01:22:33.207]  Sanders is just an old school communist.
[01:22:33.207 --> 01:22:35.108]  And they're clapping for everything he says.
[01:22:35.108 --> 01:22:36.448]  We're going to go after Wall Street.
[01:22:36.448 --> 01:22:38.228]  We're going to destroy the banks.
[01:22:38.228 --> 01:22:40.429]  We're going to break up the pharmaceutical companies.
[01:22:40.429 --> 01:22:43.290]  Well, if you break up business, you end up being Venezuela.
[01:22:43.290 --> 01:22:45.750]  Or you end up being Communist Russia.
[01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:46.231]  Sure, sure.
[01:22:46.231 --> 01:22:47.311]  But let's add the final piece.
[01:22:47.891 --> 01:22:50.411]  If you read Carol Quigley's book or others, they admit this.
[01:22:50.411 --> 01:22:54.232]  There's an ultra-rich elite that want to get rid of the middle class to create a consolidation.
[01:22:54.232 --> 01:23:00.853]  So there's ultra-corporations that are working with the socialists and communists to cut out the middle man and then cut out competition.
[01:23:00.853 --> 01:23:05.994]  And then they plan to double-cross the communists and set up a technocracy fascism.
[01:23:05.994 --> 01:23:11.655]  But I agree with you when you said the communists plan to double-cross the corporations and create a new dark age.
[01:23:11.655 --> 01:23:15.176]  So I don't know what's worse, a technocracy fascism or a dark age.
[01:23:15.176 --> 01:23:16.076]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:23:16.803 --> 01:23:19.166]  We just need to stick with our constitutional republic.
[01:23:19.166 --> 01:23:20.027]  Exactly.
[01:23:20.027 --> 01:23:23.692]  And not follow these people that have a passion for destruction.
[01:23:23.692 --> 01:23:28.919]  Well how is it not liberal to have true diversity of business and life and ideas and not have thought control?
[01:23:28.919 --> 01:23:29.780]  That's real liberalism.
[01:23:30.854 --> 01:23:36.115]  Look, in their mind, we've talked about this before, they look at America differently than conservatives.
[01:23:36.115 --> 01:23:43.237]  We look at the world and we say America is the greatest democratic constitutional republic in the history of mankind.
[01:23:43.237 --> 01:23:48.718]  The left looks at America and compares it to a perfect utopia and says it doesn't measure up.
[01:23:48.718 --> 01:23:50.159]  Therefore, we have to destroy it.
[01:23:50.919 --> 01:23:53.040]  So we can rebuild the perfect world.
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:55.241]  And that is the fallacy of progressivism.
[01:23:55.241 --> 01:23:56.422]  And that's why it costs so much.
[01:23:56.422 --> 01:23:58.523]  And all they ever build is nightmare hills that kill everybody.
[01:23:58.523 --> 01:23:59.843]  So I've been asking some of the questions.
[01:23:59.843 --> 01:24:00.924]  We got six minutes left.
[01:24:00.924 --> 01:24:05.886]  Joel Gilbert getting into the the the son of Bill Clinton.
[01:24:05.886 --> 01:24:07.227]  Clearly is the son of Bill Clinton.
[01:24:07.227 --> 01:24:07.807]  The whole background
[01:24:07.807 --> 01:24:08.527]  I don't know.
[01:24:23.052 --> 01:24:27.675]  Yeah, I've been following this for 10, 12 years and always been fascinated by it.
[01:24:27.675 --> 01:24:34.058]  And there's just no question in my mind that, you know, Danny, you know, is the son of Bill Clinton.
[01:24:34.058 --> 01:24:43.724]  There's not anybody in the world that looks like him whose mother has been telling him since he was five years old that Bill was his father and who lives in Little Rock.
[01:24:43.724 --> 01:24:47.046]  He looks a lot like Skull Shapes, very similar.
[01:24:47.546 --> 01:24:49.187]  Well, look at the teeth.
[01:24:49.187 --> 01:24:50.628]  The teeth are a match.
[01:24:50.628 --> 01:24:54.871]  I've had dentists tell me, like with Frank Marshall Davis and Barack Obama, exact teeth match.
[01:24:54.871 --> 01:24:56.372]  Especially the top teeth, huh?
[01:24:56.372 --> 01:24:57.193]  Yeah, the top teeth.
[01:24:57.193 --> 01:24:58.093]  Ears, nose.
[01:24:58.093 --> 01:25:01.256]  I mean, it reminds me of the interview I did with Malik Obama, for example.
[01:25:01.256 --> 01:25:02.336]  He's got hazel eyes.
[01:25:02.336 --> 01:25:04.258]  If you cross blue with brown, that's what you get.
[01:25:05.619 --> 01:25:12.705]  It's really a complete match and he has actually this, the thing he inherited from his dad is he does have this intangible likability factor.
[01:25:12.705 --> 01:25:15.248]  He really does have a personality.
[01:25:15.248 --> 01:25:30.282]  He's a great kid and he talks about how when he was five years old his aunt took him, you know, they were on some kind of welfare, they needed some child support, they went to the governor's mansion, his aunt snuck in the gate when the gates opened, knocked on the door, asked for Hillary
[01:25:30.942 --> 01:25:40.254]  And they slammed the door in her face, and they ran off, jumped over a fence, and were later paid some hush money, $700 a month, along with some Christmas presents.
[01:25:40.254 --> 01:25:49.825]  It's a very sad story, and I think anybody in urban America that's thinking of voting for Hillary really should look at this, because Danny talks about how it's the same as
[01:25:50.546 --> 01:26:02.289]  Back in slave times when a slave owner would have a child with a slave and the wife of the plantation owner would run him off the plantation and banishes the child.
[01:26:02.289 --> 01:26:04.230]  And that's essentially what happened to Danny.
[01:26:04.230 --> 01:26:07.691]  He was in foster homes when his father was President of the United States.
[01:26:08.331 --> 01:26:10.111]  He was in foster homes.
[01:26:10.111 --> 01:26:12.132]  He said going to bed hungry at night.
[01:26:12.132 --> 01:26:13.472]  Can you imagine that?
[01:26:13.472 --> 01:26:14.432]  I can't even imagine that.
[01:26:14.432 --> 01:26:15.092]  It's incredible.
[01:26:15.092 --> 01:26:24.974]  I had Tracy Martin, the admitted chef of the Clintons, their travel chef for five of the eight years or whatever, he worked for the Bushes as well, and he was just saying it was constant racial notes.
[01:26:24.974 --> 01:26:29.655]  She'd write notes, get this inward, get me some food, or she would verbally say it, attacking Hispanics.
[01:26:29.655 --> 01:26:35.416]  And everybody I know about the Clintons say they're just flaming racist, or just whatever is nasty to say.
[01:26:35.416 --> 01:26:37.617]  I think this is a pretty big story as well.
[01:26:38.603 --> 01:26:39.324]  I think it's huge.
[01:26:39.324 --> 01:26:41.065]  Look, the Democrats... Not Bill, I want to be clear.
[01:26:41.065 --> 01:26:42.385]  It's Hillary that says the right stuff.
[01:26:42.385 --> 01:26:44.467]  Let's talk about public and private.
[01:26:44.467 --> 01:26:46.408]  Democrats oppose the civil rights movement.
[01:26:46.408 --> 01:26:48.949]  They broke up black families with the welfare system.
[01:26:48.949 --> 01:26:51.891]  They forced them into terrible schools.
[01:26:51.891 --> 01:26:56.354]  They turned urban America into drug culture, single mothers, violent neighborhoods.
[01:26:56.354 --> 01:26:59.476]  And they keep going back asking for their votes.
[01:26:59.476 --> 01:27:02.477]  On a personal level, you can see what they do to their own family.
[01:27:02.477 --> 01:27:03.238]  Malik Obama,
[01:27:03.758 --> 01:27:04.799]  Well, I interviewed his aunt.
[01:27:33.978 --> 01:27:36.239]  Like 19 years ago, I mean this is going on.
[01:27:36.239 --> 01:27:39.699]  I talked to the to the state police that were just appalled by it all.
[01:27:39.699 --> 01:27:42.920]  In closing, about two and a half minutes, Joel Gilbert.
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:43.500]  Joel Gilbert.net.
[01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:44.681]  Folks want to find his films.
[01:27:44.681 --> 01:27:46.861]  We sell them as well at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:27:46.861 --> 01:27:50.462]  But regardless, there's a good amount of people that aren't awake.
[01:27:50.462 --> 01:27:53.803]  What do you in your gut think they're gonna pull the next 20 days?
[01:27:53.803 --> 01:27:55.143]  Where do you think all this is going?
[01:27:56.798 --> 01:28:14.573]  I think they're going to try to keep hammering, keep the focus on Donald's alleged indiscretions that is he a creepy guy or is he not, he's racist, he talks poorly about African Americans, all these exaggerations and inferences that they make from anything
[01:28:14.833 --> 01:28:14.973]  Yeah.
[01:28:32.836 --> 01:28:44.219]  Clinton pushing these narratives that were twisted and lies and half-truths, and I think it's actually reminding people of how annoying and disgusting the Clinton presidency was.
[01:28:44.219 --> 01:28:44.659]  Exactly.
[01:28:44.659 --> 01:28:45.919]  I mean, take Billy Bush.
[01:28:45.919 --> 01:28:51.801]  He now admits that was like an hour-long conversation, and then he was goading, and clearly they were setting Trump up, and it's all edited.
[01:28:52.341 --> 01:28:56.443]  I mean, I could record you for an hour and ask you questions on a road trip, you might say something.
[01:28:56.443 --> 01:29:07.168]  I mean, now that I think about these tapes, I catch myself when I'm out hiking with buddies or whatever, I'm not even really a nasty guy, I'm not really, you know, I see as kind of a, you know, shocking, but I catch myself, you know, saying some things I wouldn't want out there.
[01:29:07.168 --> 01:29:09.749]  It's like, my God, this is the type of stuff that's going on.
[01:29:09.749 --> 01:29:14.791]  I mean, this woman's running ISIS, this woman is doing all this horrible stuff and we're obsessed over some 11-year-old tape.
[01:29:15.367 --> 01:29:24.750]  Well I think that's the strategy is to only focus on Trump because there's no justification for electing Hillary to City Council, let alone President of the United States.
[01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:26.810]  She does not qualify for security clearance.
[01:29:26.810 --> 01:29:28.771]  Everything she's touched turned into a disaster.
[01:29:28.771 --> 01:29:30.612]  And now we know she tried to bribe the FBI.
[01:29:30.612 --> 01:29:31.572]  Joel Gilbert, thank you.
[01:29:31.572 --> 01:29:32.912]  Powerful information.
[01:29:32.912 --> 01:29:35.573]  Great job on the whole situation with Danny Williams.
[01:29:35.573 --> 01:29:36.893]  We're going to come back.
[01:29:36.893 --> 01:29:38.874]  We're going to get Joe Biggs and Michael Zimmerman here.
[01:29:38.874 --> 01:29:41.195]  They went to Haiti for a week with Mr. Haven.
[01:29:43.425 --> 01:29:45.707]  This is so bombshell, I don't even know how to handle it.
[01:29:45.707 --> 01:29:47.508]  I mean, this should destroy the Clinton.
[01:29:47.508 --> 01:29:49.349]  This is incredible.
[01:29:49.349 --> 01:29:50.730]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.730 --> 01:29:53.272]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.272 --> 01:29:55.954]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.898 --> 01:30:03.419]  Well, it looks like President-elect Donald Trump is making good on his promises.
[01:30:03.419 --> 01:30:06.701]  Day one of the Trump presidency to withdraw from the TPP.
[01:30:06.701 --> 01:30:10.743]  We have an article, it's up on our website, Infowars.com, and aggregated from CNS News.
[01:30:10.743 --> 01:30:16.945]  It talks about how Trump characterized the move, a part of a plan to advance the simple core principle of, quote, putting America first.
[01:30:16.945 --> 01:30:20.327]  Of course, that's been his credo, down with globalism the entire campaign.
[01:30:20.327 --> 01:30:28.410]  And now that President-elect Donald Trump, who said on Monday that his first day in office next January will be to begin the process of withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
[01:30:28.570 --> 01:30:32.192]  A prospective trade deal, which has been the centerpiece of the Obama administration.
[01:30:32.192 --> 01:30:33.754]  He's going to rebalance it.
[01:30:33.754 --> 01:30:38.597]  Now, the Obama administration wanted to rebalance to Asia, but Trump called that a horrible idea.
[01:30:38.597 --> 01:30:44.421]  He's saying in an online video message that one of his top priorities in the first 100 days is to ask his transition team to quote,
[01:30:58.650 --> 01:30:59.170]  We're good.
[01:31:28.970 --> 01:31:35.713]  And you're able to promote the products to friends and family and neighbors in your community and make money while helping people at the same time.
[01:31:35.713 --> 01:31:36.674]  Another win-win.
[01:31:36.674 --> 01:31:40.416]  That's why I'm a member of the Longevity Team at Infowarsteam.com.
[01:31:40.416 --> 01:31:41.656]  And you can be too.

[01:31:59.651 --> 01:32:06.156]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[01:32:06.156 --> 01:32:18.945]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[01:32:19.125 --> 01:32:22.787]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[01:32:22.787 --> 01:32:29.770]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:32:29.770 --> 01:32:42.557]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[01:32:42.637 --> 01:32:44.480]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:50.889]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[01:32:50.889 --> 01:32:55.816]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:33:06.104 --> 01:33:10.126]  It's Wednesday, October 12th, 2016.
[01:33:10.126 --> 01:33:14.147]  Only 26 days left in the final countdown.
[01:33:14.147 --> 01:33:16.709]  Election 2016.
[01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:19.430]  Americanism vs. Globalism.
[01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:21.531]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:21.531 --> 01:33:23.491]  Broadcasting from Austin, Texas.
[01:33:23.491 --> 01:33:24.112]  Worldwide.
[01:33:29.269 --> 01:33:41.516]  While the media distracted you with an 11-year-old tape of Donald Trump's locker room banter, WikiLeaks dropped bombshell after bombshell, and the Clinton mouthpiece media have barely even reported on it.
[01:33:41.516 --> 01:33:55.463]  In one email sent by Hillary surrogate Bill Ivey to Clinton campaign manager John Podesta, Ivey brags about how the left has sought to maintain political power by producing, quote, an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[01:33:55.523 --> 01:33:57.925]  This is beyond arrogant elitism.
[01:33:57.925 --> 01:34:00.348]  It sounds like something out of They Live.
[01:34:00.348 --> 01:34:07.055]  The gains have been substantial, both for ourselves and for you, the human power elite.
[01:34:08.191 --> 01:34:16.773]  We've all been quite content to demean government drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[01:34:16.773 --> 01:34:18.254]  Conspire.
[01:34:18.254 --> 01:34:22.815]  Conspire to produce an uninformed mass who will just do as they're told.
[01:34:22.815 --> 01:34:27.096]  The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly.
[01:34:27.096 --> 01:34:33.037]  This problem demands some serious serious thinking and not just poll-driven demographically inspired messaging.
[01:34:33.037 --> 01:34:35.478]  To emphasize, Ivy admits that the left
[01:34:35.578 --> 01:34:39.600]  So we're supposed to be outraged about Trump's locker room banter from 2005?
[01:34:56.667 --> 01:35:06.393]  Yet here we have a Clinton surrogate calling the entire population of America dumb and conspiring with the Clinton campaign to keep it that way.
[01:35:06.393 --> 01:35:08.355]  And there's no outrage whatsoever.
[01:35:08.355 --> 01:35:10.896]  There's not even any media coverage of it.
[01:35:10.896 --> 01:35:12.618]  Absolutely nothing.
[01:35:12.618 --> 01:35:21.844]  But are you really surprised, given what the other WikiLeaks emails reveal about the level of collusion between the copped media and Team Hillary?
[01:35:21.844 --> 01:35:26.607]  They talk about their friendlies in the media who will blithely regurgitate their talking points.
[01:35:26.927 --> 01:35:36.311]  Reporters like CNBC's John Harwood emailing the Clinton campaign begging to be patted on the head like an obedient dog for lavishing praise on Hillary.
[01:35:36.311 --> 01:35:42.914]  The New York Times asking the Clinton campaign for permission to use quotes from their own interview with Hillary.
[01:35:42.914 --> 01:35:47.756]  The Boston Globe colluding with her campaign to give her quote a big presence.
[01:35:47.756 --> 01:35:51.017]  This level of cronyism and corruption is staggering.
[01:35:51.417 --> 01:35:57.344]  But it explains why much of the media refuses to even cover the WikiLeaks releases.
[01:35:57.344 --> 01:36:05.012]  Things like Hillary openly admitting that our so-called allies, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, are funding and supporting ISIS.
[01:36:05.012 --> 01:36:06.334]  Oh, but Trump said the word possible.
[01:36:06.374 --> 01:36:09.016]  We'll see in 2005, so I guess that's more important.
[01:36:09.016 --> 01:36:15.861]  Confirmation that Hillary deliberately and criminally deleted certain emails to hide evidence of her wrongdoing.
[01:36:15.861 --> 01:36:20.505]  Moles inside Bernie Sanders' campaign who betrayed his strategy to tip off Hillary.
[01:36:20.505 --> 01:36:26.329]  Bill Clinton's behaviour pushing a female Clinton Foundation staffer to near suicide.
[01:36:26.329 --> 01:36:33.074]  Insiders within Hillary's campaign petrified about the damage posed by Bill Clinton's sexual predatory past.
[01:36:33.454 --> 01:36:36.277]  Oh, but you didn't hear about any of this on CNN.
[01:36:36.277 --> 01:36:40.260]  But you did hear Donald Trump say the word posse in 2005.
[01:36:40.260 --> 01:36:43.703]  And to the media, that's what matters.
[01:36:43.703 --> 01:36:47.246]  And they wonder why their readership is collapsing.
[01:36:47.246 --> 01:36:55.053]  They wonder why 94% of the American people no longer trust a thing they say.
[01:37:10.438 --> 01:37:17.120]  I mean, she is an abject, psychopathic demon from hell that as soon as she gets into power is going to try to destroy the planet.
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:20.641]  She's worked like a demon, as you know, in Secretary of State.
[01:37:20.641 --> 01:37:25.462]  We came, we saw, she died.
[01:37:25.462 --> 01:37:28.423]  What difference, at this point, does it make?
[01:37:28.423 --> 01:37:39.086]  And there's only one candidate in this race who understands that democracy in a big, diverse country doesn't work if you constantly demonize each other, demonize each other.
[01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:45.194]  You could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.
[01:37:45.194 --> 01:37:46.855]  And I mean that literally, by the way.
[01:37:46.855 --> 01:37:56.281]  I was reading the other day, there's a guy on the radio who apparently, Trump's on his show frequently, he said me and Hillary are demons.
[01:37:56.281 --> 01:37:59.824]  I'm telling you.
[01:37:59.824 --> 01:38:03.146]  She is a demon.
[01:38:03.146 --> 01:38:04.127]  This is biblical.
[01:38:04.127 --> 01:38:05.988]  She's going to launch a nuclear war.
[01:38:07.848 --> 01:38:08.508]  Said we.
[01:38:08.508 --> 01:38:09.849]  Smell like sulfur.
[01:38:09.849 --> 01:38:19.891]  Ain't that something?
[01:38:19.891 --> 01:38:26.393]  Now... I mean... Come on, people!
[01:38:28.675 --> 01:38:31.017]  You can't wash that evil off of Hillary.
[01:38:31.017 --> 01:38:31.377]  I'm not kidding.
[01:38:31.377 --> 01:38:36.520]  People say... They say... Folks, I've been told this by high up folks.
[01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:39.882]  They say, listen, Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[01:38:39.882 --> 01:38:45.506]  I never said this because the media went crazy with it, but I've talked to people that are in protective details.
[01:38:45.506 --> 01:38:46.706]  I mean, they're scared out there.
[01:38:46.706 --> 01:38:51.009]  And they say, listen, she's a freaking demon and she stinks and so does Obama.
[01:38:51.009 --> 01:38:51.810]  And I go, like, what?
[01:38:51.810 --> 01:38:53.471]  Sulfur.
[01:38:53.471 --> 01:38:55.052]  They smell like hell.
[01:38:56.483 --> 01:38:59.927]  On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C.
[01:38:59.927 --> 01:39:04.952]  will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.
[01:39:04.952 --> 01:39:07.395]  It's about time.
[01:39:07.395 --> 01:39:12.721]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[01:39:24.887 --> 01:39:27.409]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:39:27.409 --> 01:39:35.613]  Danny Williams, now of Hot Springs, Arkansas, grew up in Little Rock, there at the Capitol, where his mother reportedly met the governor, Bill Clinton, is here with us.
[01:39:35.613 --> 01:39:42.918]  I remember interviewing your aunt back in the late 1990s, church lady, many years, hard worker, great record.
[01:39:42.918 --> 01:39:46.660]  You yourself got three children, no record, hard working guy.
[01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:48.661]  I think your story is very, very incredible.
[01:39:48.661 --> 01:39:51.583]  We're going to walk through it, talk about it today, but thanks for coming to Austin, Texas, sir.
[01:39:53.188 --> 01:39:54.469]  Nice to have him here.
[01:39:54.469 --> 01:39:57.292]  We'll turn his mic on for folks.
[01:39:57.292 --> 01:39:59.174]  Danny, where to begin here?
[01:39:59.174 --> 01:40:10.226]  I mean, let's talk about you personally, where you're from, where you grew up, and then we'll start talking about the first time you ever heard from your mother that a certain person was your father.
[01:40:10.226 --> 01:40:11.507]  Right.
[01:40:11.507 --> 01:40:12.628]  My name is Danny Williams.
[01:40:12.628 --> 01:40:14.630]  I'm from Little Arkansas.
[01:40:14.630 --> 01:40:15.852]  I'm at age 30 right now.
[01:40:17.214 --> 01:40:28.379]  And all my life I've been told that Bill Clinton was my father by my mom, my aunt, and other relatives that grew up with me.
[01:40:28.379 --> 01:40:30.860]  I mean, continue.
[01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:32.201]  I mean, I know you haven't been on TV before.
[01:40:32.201 --> 01:40:32.981]  You're live right now.
[01:40:32.981 --> 01:40:35.002]  Please keep going.
[01:40:35.002 --> 01:40:41.645]  But anyway, yes, I want to know the truth about Bill Clinton being my father.
[01:40:41.645 --> 01:40:42.966]  And that's all I ask is the truth.
[01:40:45.472 --> 01:40:46.758]  Do you think Bill Clinton is your father?
[01:40:46.758 --> 01:40:47.080]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:49.738 --> 01:40:59.145]  You know, instead of just going through your whole history, and we're going to do it and talk about it, play clips of Clinton being asked about you by the press, and you won't respond.
[01:40:59.145 --> 01:41:01.667]  We're teleprompter free here.
[01:41:01.667 --> 01:41:02.888]  I'm just out of the gates.
[01:41:02.888 --> 01:41:04.149]  Bill Clinton will be watching this.
[01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:05.470]  This is undoubted.
[01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:08.292]  Obama responded to us yesterday, Hillary a few weeks ago.
[01:41:08.292 --> 01:41:09.233]  They watch every day.
[01:41:09.233 --> 01:41:13.576]  This shows in thousands of newspapers a day, all over every cable channel.
[01:41:13.576 --> 01:41:14.317]  Yes, sir.
[01:41:14.317 --> 01:41:15.758]  We didn't do some pre-interview here.
[01:41:15.758 --> 01:41:17.259]  You just flew in at like 11 o'clock today.
[01:41:17.259 --> 01:41:18.200]  You just got here about an hour ago.
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:20.301]  Look into that camera right there, sir.
[01:41:20.301 --> 01:41:22.742]  Camera 4.
[01:41:22.742 --> 01:41:27.484]  Bill Clinton, William Jefferson Clinton will either be watching this live or he'll watch it later.
[01:41:27.484 --> 01:41:29.024]  What do you want to say to Bill Clinton?
[01:41:29.024 --> 01:41:29.785]  Camera 4.
[01:41:29.785 --> 01:41:33.826]  I mean, I'd just like to ask and say to Bill Clinton that I want to meet you.
[01:41:33.826 --> 01:41:35.207]  I want to shake your hand.
[01:41:35.207 --> 01:41:42.690]  I want my kids to know their grandfathers.
[01:41:42.690 --> 01:41:47.092]  And I'd like to just, you know, I'd like to just meet them, get to know them, you know.
[01:41:49.884 --> 01:41:55.570]  I mean, I never had a father in my life, so, you know, it's hard.
[01:41:55.570 --> 01:41:57.732]  It's difficult in explaining it, you know.
[01:41:57.732 --> 01:41:58.794]  It's okay.
[01:41:58.794 --> 01:41:59.194]  Go with it.
[01:41:59.194 --> 01:41:59.915]  It's all right.
[01:41:59.915 --> 01:42:00.816]  I've talked to you in private.
[01:42:00.816 --> 01:42:08.083]  I understand coming from the middle of Arkansas to now being with the top link on Drudge and you see yourself right there and all over the world.
[01:42:08.083 --> 01:42:09.425]  But just tell it like it is.
[01:42:10.586 --> 01:42:14.709]  You believe Bill Clinton's your father, your mother always told you that, he sent you money, all the rest of it.
[01:42:14.709 --> 01:42:15.009]  Right.
[01:42:15.009 --> 01:42:17.991]  He won't respond to it, so Bill Clinton and Hillary are watching right now.
[01:42:17.991 --> 01:42:18.351]  Right.
[01:42:18.351 --> 01:42:24.576]  How about an epic story, the videos on your Facebook, it's on Infowars, trying to go over the fence at the Governor's Mansion.
[01:42:24.576 --> 01:42:26.017]  You wanted to meet your daddy?
[01:42:26.017 --> 01:42:28.078]  I mean, you're meeting him right now, digitally.
[01:42:28.078 --> 01:42:28.639]  Right.
[01:42:28.639 --> 01:42:30.720]  Right there, my friend, what do you want to say?
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:31.641]  I want to, I'd like to say...
[01:42:34.733 --> 01:42:35.574]  My name is Danny Wade.
[01:42:35.574 --> 01:42:42.260]  I'd like to just say, you know, I want to be able to experience that having a father in your life, you know what I'm saying?
[01:42:42.260 --> 01:42:44.162]  And now I got kids of my own.
[01:42:44.162 --> 01:42:45.804]  I want my kids to know their grandfather.
[01:42:45.804 --> 01:42:47.365]  They ask me all the time, who's your dad?
[01:42:47.365 --> 01:42:48.286]  You know?
[01:42:48.286 --> 01:42:57.135]  So, I mean, it's my chance now and get my story out and letting the world know who I am and who's my father and, you know, the truth about everything.
[01:42:59.158 --> 01:43:05.400]  Well, the Daily Mail has the headline, Bill Clinton's grandkids, you know, will he look into meeting with them?
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:08.261]  We'll go back to that in a moment, but just starting at the beginning.
[01:43:08.261 --> 01:43:09.021]  Okay.
[01:43:09.021 --> 01:43:13.082]  Break down how you grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas.
[01:43:13.082 --> 01:43:14.623]  You're now in Hot Springs.
[01:43:14.623 --> 01:43:17.844]  What it was like and when you first began to hear this.
[01:43:17.844 --> 01:43:19.264]  Okay.
[01:43:19.264 --> 01:43:22.085]  Well, growing up in Arkansas, it was like everybody knew.
[01:43:22.085 --> 01:43:24.766]  Everybody, you know, they'd say, that's Bill Clinton's son.
[01:43:24.766 --> 01:43:27.407]  And everywhere I go, you know,
[01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:31.662]  So, I mean, growing up, it was rough growing up.
[01:43:31.662 --> 01:43:33.764]  I mean, we barely was making it.
[01:43:33.764 --> 01:43:36.166]  We was broke.
[01:43:36.166 --> 01:43:43.692]  I mean, my aunt, she worked two jobs trying to raise us, me and my little brothers and sisters.
[01:43:43.692 --> 01:43:53.779]  I mean, everybody in Arkansas at the time I was coming up knew about me being his son, preachers and all.
[01:43:53.779 --> 01:43:53.819]  So,
[01:43:56.283 --> 01:44:09.591]  I just want to be able to just, you know, have this chance and get myself out and explaining who I am and why am I facing the world today to reach my father.
[01:44:09.591 --> 01:44:19.297]  I noticed in the video interview we did that we aired, you talked about wanting to meet him because you heard he was sick, in your own words.
[01:44:19.297 --> 01:44:24.921]  Right, I heard he has Perkins, if I'm not mistaken, heart problems and they, you know,
[01:44:26.124 --> 01:44:42.192]  People ain't living long these days, so ain't no telling when he may pass, you know, so now it's, I mean, now it's my chance to be able to get my story out and get it heard to me, my father, before that happened, you know, before he, something tragic happened to him.
[01:44:42.757 --> 01:44:47.243]  Well, we can go to Joel Gilbert's website or WorldMedDaily and show some of the articles while you're speaking.
[01:44:47.243 --> 01:44:47.644]  Right.
[01:44:47.644 --> 01:44:51.389]  You next to Bill Clinton for TV viewers watching.
[01:44:51.389 --> 01:44:53.052]  I mean, how much you look like him.
[01:44:53.052 --> 01:44:56.677]  But I remember back at the time that
[01:44:58.703 --> 01:45:06.029]  When I first had your aunt on, this has got to be 20 years ago almost, 19 years ago, that this is what I was getting from the state police and others.
[01:45:06.029 --> 01:45:09.072]  So, let's get into what you talk about in the video.
[01:45:09.072 --> 01:45:16.718]  When you first started hearing this, before you heard about it, your mother tried to get you in the scene with the Governor's Mansion, then later you tried to get on the property when you were older.
[01:45:16.718 --> 01:45:18.579]  Let's go through this, Danny.
[01:45:18.579 --> 01:45:21.462]  Okay, well, it was my aunt, actually.
[01:45:21.462 --> 01:45:23.303]  My mom had lost custody of us.
[01:45:24.885 --> 01:45:25.725]  Sure you're in.
[01:45:25.725 --> 01:45:26.346]  Yeah, right.
[01:45:26.346 --> 01:45:28.606]  My aunt had got custody of him, my aunt Lucille.
[01:45:28.606 --> 01:45:38.129]  So one day she was like, I want, you know, she took me down to the government mansion and she was like, you know, we're going to let him know that you're his son.
[01:45:38.129 --> 01:45:47.792]  So we went down there and she had to sneak through the gates and she went up to the door and the butler answered the door and she asked for Hillary.
[01:45:48.516 --> 01:45:52.199]  And the door slammed in her face, and we were told to get off the property.
[01:45:52.199 --> 01:46:00.247]  So she took off running, snatched me by one arm, and all I can remember is my arm hurting, and she snatched me to jump over the fence.
[01:46:00.247 --> 01:46:03.430]  And she asked me all the time, do you remember me taking you to the Governor's Mansion?
[01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:04.451]  I said, yeah, I remember.
[01:46:04.451 --> 01:46:07.433]  I remember you snatching my arm and taking off running.
[01:46:07.433 --> 01:46:08.795]  So, you know.
[01:46:10.074 --> 01:46:12.397]  I mean, it's never went away.
[01:46:12.397 --> 01:46:18.404]  I mean, he has delivered Christmas gifts to my home by Arkansas State Troopers.
[01:46:18.404 --> 01:46:21.548]  He has paid my mom under the table.
[01:46:21.548 --> 01:46:27.534]  Up until the time he made president in 1993, he stopped doing anything for us.
[01:46:27.534 --> 01:46:30.398]  So I believe in my heart that he tried to be in my life.
[01:46:34.062 --> 01:46:37.704]  Well, this is a narrative that comes out from everybody that Hillary runs the show.
[01:46:37.704 --> 01:46:38.865]  Hillary's the boss.
[01:46:38.865 --> 01:46:39.125]  Right.
[01:46:39.125 --> 01:46:42.888]  She actually manages him and uses his issues as a control mechanism.
[01:46:42.888 --> 01:46:46.590]  From your research, who is it that kept you away from the man you believe to be your father?
[01:46:46.590 --> 01:46:46.991]  Correct.
[01:46:46.991 --> 01:46:48.992]  I think Hillary is the one that kept me away.
[01:46:48.992 --> 01:46:54.556]  I mean, as a married couple, your decisions are one.
[01:46:54.556 --> 01:47:01.740]  So, I'm sure she know of me and I'm sure she had parts in with the
[01:47:03.391 --> 01:47:13.080]  All the publicity, all the stories in the press that, you know, falsely reports all we have taken the DNA, all of that is false, you know.
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:18.745]  So, you know, I really do think she she has played a part in.
[01:47:18.745 --> 01:47:20.907]  And as they call banishing me, you know.
[01:47:20.907 --> 01:47:20.967]  Now.
[01:47:26.243 --> 01:47:30.945]  I know it's hard for you to talk about, but you've discussed mentally, psychologically, what this has done to you.
[01:47:30.945 --> 01:47:32.826]  I mean, go over the years, when you first started.
[01:47:32.826 --> 01:47:36.768]  How old were you when you first started learning about this, and then what did it do over the years?
[01:47:36.768 --> 01:47:40.310]  Okay, when I first started learning, I was probably about eight or nine.
[01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:46.993]  I was in school, and you know, my teachers, they would look at me and they'd be like, they'd be whispering, you know, it's Bill Clinton's son.
[01:47:46.993 --> 01:47:50.835]  His mother's the one that claims she had a baby by Bill Clinton.
[01:47:50.835 --> 01:47:53.256]  And, you know, it's just difficult, you know, growing up.
[01:47:55.501 --> 01:47:57.923]  House to house, you know, not stable.
[01:47:57.923 --> 01:48:00.184]  It just became difficult my whole life.
[01:48:00.184 --> 01:48:10.791]  So, you know, I just thought about it, you know, I'm like, there's something true to it that after all these years, they still put out false reports.
[01:48:10.791 --> 01:48:17.055]  1999, 2000, the false DNA, you know, all these articles that they put out that's false about me.
[01:48:18.058 --> 01:48:23.922]  But the article that my mother gave in 93 is, you know, somebody bought rightful ownership to it.
[01:48:23.922 --> 01:48:29.286]  And, you know, it just, it make you think so.
[01:48:29.286 --> 01:48:36.791]  Two years almost, two years ago, two years and a half ago, I started my Facebook page campaigning for me and Bill Clinton, Bill Clinton being my father.
[01:48:37.552 --> 01:48:39.734]  I wanted to know, and I've always wanted to know.
[01:48:39.734 --> 01:48:41.876]  I just never got any help.
[01:48:41.876 --> 01:48:44.378]  I reached out to lawyers and investigators.
[01:48:44.378 --> 01:48:46.660]  They were not looking to my case.
[01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:47.220]  No one.
[01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:53.906]  So I started campaigning my own Facebook page and saying Bill Clinton, my father, and I'm trying to get my story out.
[01:48:54.994 --> 01:48:59.357]  Well keep rolling, I love the fact that you're relaxed, I can tell you're nervous, who wouldn't be?
[01:48:59.357 --> 01:49:08.742]  The head of CNN, Jeff Zucker, it's all come out in WikiLeaks too, they order him, don't talk about Bill Clinton's sex crimes, don't talk about Hillary's health, don't talk about illegitimate children, don't talk about it.
[01:49:10.964 --> 01:49:11.124]  I mean...
[01:49:34.284 --> 01:49:35.204]  I think a lot about it.
[01:49:35.204 --> 01:49:50.608]  Actually, I think, you know, as far as she stand up and saying, well, the kid, you know, kids gonna be, we're gonna make sure kids have the rightful, you know, taking care of them and rightful schools, you know, and all this.
[01:49:50.608 --> 01:49:54.289]  I actually think that they are lies.
[01:49:54.289 --> 01:50:01.751]  And I think she's just using it to make, to be in office.
[01:50:01.751 --> 01:50:02.651]  And to be clear today,
[01:50:03.905 --> 01:50:07.649]  When I went there about an hour before he went on air, I said, listen, we've never really talked.
[01:50:07.649 --> 01:50:09.210]  We've talked over the phone a couple times.
[01:50:09.210 --> 01:50:10.391]  My crew has.
[01:50:10.391 --> 01:50:11.332]  You just flew in today.
[01:50:11.332 --> 01:50:13.234]  You've been talking to the bigs and stuff.
[01:50:13.234 --> 01:50:16.417]  I said, will you just please write notes on the questions you want me to ask?
[01:50:16.417 --> 01:50:17.538]  And he wrote those up.
[01:50:17.538 --> 01:50:18.739]  These are your thoughts.
[01:50:18.739 --> 01:50:20.461]  These are your questions.
[01:50:20.461 --> 01:50:24.986]  One thing that got brought up is Bill Clinton a couple weeks ago got asked about his son, reported son, Danny Williams.
[01:50:26.204 --> 01:50:28.184]  Uh, by a YouTuber called Charlie in the Box.
[01:50:28.184 --> 01:50:29.585]  I want to skip this network break.
[01:50:29.585 --> 01:50:29.825]  Right.
[01:50:29.825 --> 01:50:30.645]  This is so important.
[01:50:30.645 --> 01:50:37.306]  I want to play this since you mentioned this, and just again, go back to if you were really in the room with Bill Clinton, because you are in the room with him.
[01:50:37.306 --> 01:50:39.646]  He will watch this, undoubtedly.
[01:50:39.646 --> 01:50:40.126]  Yes, sir.
[01:50:40.126 --> 01:50:48.228]  I mean, you know, spill it out there, because you need to talk directly to him, uh, because, uh, I've talked to the Arkansas State Police back when I was being given these, these, these tips.
[01:50:48.228 --> 01:50:48.728]  Mm-hmm.
[01:50:48.728 --> 01:50:51.889]  Believe me, they didn't send people down here to get me fired and get my ass beaten.
[01:50:51.889 --> 01:50:52.869]  Right.
[01:50:52.869 --> 01:50:53.949]  Because you weren't his, uh,
[01:50:54.827 --> 01:50:56.168]  You know, Warren is illegitimate son.
[01:50:56.168 --> 01:50:56.968]  They're concerned about this.
[01:50:56.968 --> 01:51:02.171]  I want to talk about your memories with mama and the money and the presence and which humanizes Bill.
[01:51:02.171 --> 01:51:02.412]  Right.
[01:51:02.412 --> 01:51:03.472]  We're not trying to demonize Hillary.
[01:51:03.472 --> 01:51:07.995]  She was the one even 20 years ago before he knew she'd run for president they were saying was shut this down.
[01:51:07.995 --> 01:51:13.578]  So I want to talk about that with Danny Williams, a reported son of Bill Clinton.
[01:51:13.578 --> 01:51:22.304]  Let's go and play this clip here of the protester asking Bill Clinton about, well not even a protest, he's there just at the gate.
[01:51:23.477 --> 01:51:27.925]  As Obama comes by, shaking hands with the Secret Service, saying, what about Danny Williams?
[01:51:27.925 --> 01:51:28.265]  Here it is.
[01:51:29.917 --> 01:51:31.257]  Thank you, Mr. Clinton.
[01:51:31.257 --> 01:51:35.400]  Mr. Clinton, would you like to make a comment to Danny Williams?
[01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:41.763]  Mr. Clinton, can you make a comment about Trump saying about rape allegations?
[01:51:41.763 --> 01:51:43.865]  Hey, I don't want to hear any of that.
[01:51:43.865 --> 01:51:44.905]  Knock it off.
[01:51:44.905 --> 01:51:48.287]  Can you get any comment about anything like that, please?
[01:51:48.287 --> 01:51:49.288]  Come on, stop.
[01:51:49.288 --> 01:51:51.449]  Hey, this is a monumental event for us.
[01:51:51.449 --> 01:51:53.190]  We don't want to hear it.
[01:51:53.190 --> 01:51:58.093]  I know, but we got a lot of questions that aren't being answered from the American people.
[01:52:00.137 --> 01:52:01.478]  I mean, they acted like Danny.
[01:52:01.478 --> 01:52:02.739]  They knew what was going on.
[01:52:02.739 --> 01:52:06.141]  Bill looked like having a nice day when he looked at that camera.
[01:52:06.141 --> 01:52:11.785]  I don't want to dehumanize him because I know he's got a lot of problems, but he did deliver money to you for how many years?
[01:52:11.785 --> 01:52:12.906]  I mean, how many?
[01:52:12.906 --> 01:52:17.749]  All the way up until 93, he made presents to me.
[01:52:17.749 --> 01:52:23.453]  My mom received $700 and $100 bills in her mailbox every month.
[01:52:23.453 --> 01:52:25.575]  And the Christmas presents on Christmas.
[01:52:26.778 --> 01:52:26.938]  Do you
[01:52:51.363 --> 01:52:55.406]  It's not that, I mean... I mean, I know what my dad looks like, he looks like me a lot.
[01:52:55.406 --> 01:52:56.607]  Exactly.
[01:52:56.607 --> 01:52:57.387]  Exactly.
[01:52:57.387 --> 01:53:00.350]  So, I mean, I just, all I want is the truth out.
[01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:01.751]  That's all I'm reaching for, the truth.
[01:53:01.751 --> 01:53:04.292]  There's not no political scandal.
[01:53:04.292 --> 01:53:06.074]  I mean, I'm just here for the truth.
[01:53:08.342 --> 01:53:09.403]  I mean, here it is right here.
[01:53:09.403 --> 01:53:11.864]  Now, I don't know what's going on.
[01:53:11.864 --> 01:53:13.124]  I mean, we flew you in.
[01:53:13.124 --> 01:53:14.565]  I'm busy, you're busy.
[01:53:14.565 --> 01:53:15.826]  I'm not micromanaging stuff.
[01:53:15.826 --> 01:53:16.506]  Yes, sir.
[01:53:16.506 --> 01:53:21.969]  All of a sudden, I guess, during the break, last hour and a half you were here, you did an interview with the crew and they transcribed it.
[01:53:21.969 --> 01:53:25.190]  Bill Clinton's son tells Hillary, step aside.
[01:53:25.190 --> 01:53:26.871]  This just went up on Infowars.com.
[01:53:26.871 --> 01:53:29.012]  Did you write this before you got here or just today?
[01:53:29.012 --> 01:53:33.555]  Because I'll be honest, they just walked in and- I wrote that before I got here and I'm asking her to step aside.
[01:53:33.555 --> 01:53:37.957]  All I want is a sample of his DNA to prove who I am and my story is true today.
[01:53:38.797 --> 01:53:39.817]  We'll put that up on screen.
[01:53:39.817 --> 01:53:43.618]  Okay, well, I'm telling you folks, he's running the show here today.
[01:53:43.618 --> 01:53:45.999]  Danny, and again, why did you choose us to bring this out?
[01:53:45.999 --> 01:53:55.281]  Because we... I mean, I choose y'all, for one, I need the world to know.
[01:53:55.281 --> 01:54:04.203]  And I'm trying to get as many people as I can to let me speak about the truth of my story and why am I doing this today.
[01:54:04.203 --> 01:54:07.004]  I mean, I've been trying all my life to get this out.
[01:54:08.570 --> 01:54:10.751]  That's right, the media spends it like you just popped up now.
[01:54:10.751 --> 01:54:11.252]  Right, no.
[01:54:11.252 --> 01:54:12.933]  I was interviewing your aunt 20 years ago.
[01:54:12.933 --> 01:54:13.553]  No.
[01:54:13.553 --> 01:54:19.457]  There's been articles since 93, 99, 98, 95 when he ran for a second term.
[01:54:19.457 --> 01:54:23.739]  So, I mean, those articles when I was a kid.
[01:54:23.739 --> 01:54:29.122]  And now that I'm grown, they... And let's be clear, your mother said he was the only white man she was with.
[01:54:29.122 --> 01:54:29.743]  Right, correct.
[01:54:30.922 --> 01:54:33.023]  My mother explains to me all the time.
[01:54:33.023 --> 01:54:34.463]  Her story never changed.
[01:54:34.463 --> 01:54:35.944]  It's always consisted of the same.
[01:54:35.944 --> 01:54:36.624]  How did it start?
[01:54:36.624 --> 01:54:37.545]  You're eight years old.
[01:54:37.545 --> 01:54:39.125]  What does mama tell you?
[01:54:39.125 --> 01:54:41.066]  My mama told me that she dated him.
[01:54:41.066 --> 01:54:47.268]  And, you know, she dated guys for money, you know, to afford to take care of us.
[01:54:47.268 --> 01:54:51.110]  So, at the time, my mother had two older sons besides me.
[01:54:52.574 --> 01:54:59.399]  So, she's telling me, you know, how he's pick her up, you know, she destroys his mother's house, you know, everything she destroys in 93.
[01:54:59.399 --> 01:55:01.760]  Now she follows her mother when she was young, very beautiful.
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:02.941]  Right, very beautiful.
[01:55:02.941 --> 01:55:11.146]  She's never been always, you know, as people think she is, oh, she's a drug addict, she's this, she's that.
[01:55:11.146 --> 01:55:14.188]  No, she's always done the best she could to take care of her.
[01:55:14.188 --> 01:55:15.790]  She's been down a long road.
[01:55:15.790 --> 01:55:16.050]  Right.
[01:55:17.133 --> 01:55:28.381]  And right now she's, she's at this point in her life right now, she's still alive and she's driven by guilt on how we was brought up and what she could have done better.
[01:55:28.381 --> 01:55:34.185]  And you know, and I feel that she's afraid to speak out public about this situation.
[01:55:35.285 --> 01:55:35.905]  And tell her why.
[01:55:35.905 --> 01:55:36.786]  I mean, tell us why.
[01:55:36.786 --> 01:55:37.566]  We know what Hillary did.
[01:55:37.566 --> 01:55:38.587]  Tell us.
[01:55:38.587 --> 01:55:41.068]  I mean, they tried to hush her up.
[01:55:41.068 --> 01:55:43.949]  My mom had been pushed out of a two-story window.
[01:55:43.949 --> 01:55:45.250]  She got metal plates in her foot.
[01:55:45.250 --> 01:55:47.251]  By the way, nobody's heard this, but there's been threats.
[01:55:47.251 --> 01:55:48.031]  That's why everybody's freaked.
[01:55:48.031 --> 01:55:49.412]  Go ahead and tell people what happened.
[01:55:49.412 --> 01:55:50.913]  I get threats today on Facebook.
[01:55:50.913 --> 01:55:51.933]  They tell me, oh, they're cleansed.
[01:55:51.933 --> 01:55:52.994]  Tell people what happened to your mother.
[01:55:52.994 --> 01:55:53.794]  Tell them what the police did.
[01:55:53.794 --> 01:55:55.675]  Tell them what the state police did.
[01:55:55.675 --> 01:55:57.596]  They're famous for breaking people's arms and legs.
[01:55:57.596 --> 01:55:57.916]  Right.
[01:55:57.916 --> 01:55:59.177]  I mean, Jennifer Flowers.
[01:55:59.177 --> 01:56:01.518]  I was told that she was pushed out of a two-story window.
[01:56:01.518 --> 01:56:03.359]  And this was told by my mom.
[01:56:03.359 --> 01:56:04.420]  She got a metal plate from her.
[01:56:05.609 --> 01:56:07.951]  Bottom of her toes up to her ankle.
[01:56:07.951 --> 01:56:14.957]  And I was told that, you know, people was trying to kill her because of her claim of her having a son by Bill Clinton.
[01:56:14.957 --> 01:56:17.439]  Now, bottom line, we're all risking our lives here, so please continue.
[01:56:17.439 --> 01:56:18.700]  Talk to Bill.
[01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:20.561]  I mean, this is what she gets.
[01:56:20.561 --> 01:56:21.382]  I mean, tell him.
[01:56:21.382 --> 01:56:22.042]  Right.
[01:56:22.042 --> 01:56:29.929]  And today, Bill, all I want to do is get the truth out behind who I am and that I am your son.
[01:56:29.929 --> 01:56:33.452]  And I would like for my kids, your grandkids, to meet you.
[01:56:36.693 --> 01:56:37.253]  I mean it's
[01:56:52.459 --> 01:56:53.859]  People don't believe you, you know?
[01:56:53.859 --> 01:56:55.700]  You go through this, you're trying to reach your story out.
[01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:57.901]  People are like, oh, he's just a scam.
[01:56:57.901 --> 01:56:59.101]  He's this, he's helping Trump.
[01:56:59.101 --> 01:57:00.141]  Trump never pays.
[01:57:00.141 --> 01:57:01.162]  I don't work for Trump.
[01:57:01.162 --> 01:57:02.022]  I work for myself.
[01:57:02.022 --> 01:57:05.483]  I've done this two years ago before she even started running.
[01:57:05.483 --> 01:57:07.664]  She supposed to run in 2008 and made president.
[01:57:07.664 --> 01:57:09.884]  I interviewed your aunt 19 years ago.
[01:57:09.884 --> 01:57:11.745]  That's nothing to do with Trump.
[01:57:11.745 --> 01:57:12.825]  Right.
[01:57:12.825 --> 01:57:18.287]  So, like I say, it's the truth on who I am and where I'm trying to go in my life.
[01:57:18.287 --> 01:57:19.247]  I know that
[01:57:20.660 --> 01:57:28.583]  With me getting my story out and helping my kids and raising, I raised my kids and I helped raise my little sisters and brothers.
[01:57:28.583 --> 01:57:35.787]  I know that one day it is someone out there that might need my help and that'll go through the same thing I went through in my life.
[01:57:35.787 --> 01:57:38.067]  So, no, it's a destiny for me to get my story out.
[01:57:38.067 --> 01:57:38.688]  No, it makes sense.
[01:57:38.688 --> 01:57:45.931]  I know you've talked about this privately, but if he behind the scenes just help out and be with the kids and recognize you, it's like you want to meet your dad.
[01:57:45.931 --> 01:57:47.351]  I mean, you've got grandkids.
[01:57:47.351 --> 01:57:48.152]  Those are his grandkids.
[01:57:49.957 --> 01:57:53.020]  I mean, let me tell you, if I had black grandkids, I'd want to know them.
[01:57:53.020 --> 01:57:53.760]  Right, correct.
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:56.363]  I mean, I don't care what color they are, I love them.
[01:57:56.363 --> 01:57:58.144]  I had my first child at 16.
[01:57:58.144 --> 01:58:05.490]  I dropped out of school in 11th grade, working full-time in a donut shop to raise my child and my little sisters and brothers.
[01:58:05.490 --> 01:58:11.896]  So, like I said, it's been hard and rough for me traveling this road, but I'll never give up and I will not give up.
[01:58:12.953 --> 01:58:16.234]  Until, you know, he step up and say, yes, I'm willing to give you a sample.
[01:58:16.234 --> 01:58:18.455]  I'm willing to put this behind us.
[01:58:18.455 --> 01:58:20.476]  So Bill Clinton give the sample and prove it wrong.
[01:58:20.476 --> 01:58:22.677]  The third party's watching.
[01:58:22.677 --> 01:58:24.238]  Right.
[01:58:24.238 --> 01:58:25.358]  He got into it, folks.
[01:58:25.358 --> 01:58:28.499]  But his mother got threatened by the state police and Hillary in person.
[01:58:28.499 --> 01:58:29.900]  Put her in prison or kill her.
[01:58:29.900 --> 01:58:32.381]  Then she got thrown out a window a month later.
[01:58:32.381 --> 01:58:36.022]  And we've already been threatened over this interview today, just so you know.
[01:58:36.022 --> 01:58:39.504]  And when I had his ant on, I got beat up a week later.
[01:58:39.504 --> 01:58:41.865]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.807 --> 01:58:45.990]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[01:58:50.436 --> 01:58:51.877]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:58:51.877 --> 01:58:53.198]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:58:53.198 --> 01:58:54.419]  Why is this so good?
[01:58:54.419 --> 01:58:59.704]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:58:59.704 --> 01:59:13.257]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:59:13.257 --> 01:59:14.618]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:59:15.519 --> 01:59:17.020]  Spreading disease around.
[01:59:17.020 --> 01:59:19.602]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:59:19.602 --> 01:59:20.903]  These are all parasites.
[01:59:20.903 --> 01:59:22.023]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:59:22.023 --> 01:59:23.344]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:59:23.344 --> 01:59:27.847]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:59:27.847 --> 01:59:31.049]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:59:31.049 --> 01:59:34.191]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:59:34.191 --> 01:59:35.252]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:59:35.252 --> 01:59:37.173]  LivingDefense, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:37.173 --> 01:59:38.194]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:59:38.194 --> 01:59:40.215]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:59:41.756 --> 01:59:42.797]  You support the broadcast.
[01:59:42.797 --> 01:59:44.139]  Infowarslives.com.
[01:59:44.139 --> 01:59:46.401]  Thank you Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:59:46.401 --> 01:59:51.886]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:59:51.886 --> 01:59:54.449]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:14.793 --> 02:00:17.395]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:17.395 --> 02:00:26.400]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:37.007]  Powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media, the press.
[02:00:37.007 --> 02:00:38.748]  Let's be clear on one thing.
[02:00:42.799 --> 02:00:49.602]  The corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism.
[02:00:49.602 --> 02:01:00.488]  They're a political special interest, no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity, with a total political agenda.
[02:01:00.488 --> 02:01:10.032]  And the agenda is not for you, it's for themselves.
[02:01:10.032 --> 02:01:11.153]  And their agenda
[02:01:12.276 --> 02:01:25.001]  Is to elect crooked Hillary Clinton at any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy.
[02:01:25.001 --> 02:01:28.242]  For them, it's a war.
[02:01:28.242 --> 02:01:33.884]  And for them, nothing at all is out of bounds.
[02:01:33.884 --> 02:01:39.026]  This is a struggle for the survival of our nation, believe me.
[02:01:40.345 --> 02:01:44.729]  And this will be our last chance to save it on November 8th.
[02:01:44.729 --> 02:01:46.792]  Remember that.
[02:01:46.792 --> 02:01:53.258]  You know what's incredible about watching Trump's speeches unedited like I do on a routine basis?
[02:01:53.258 --> 02:01:54.279]  He gives three or four a day.
[02:01:54.279 --> 02:01:59.144]  He has such amazing stamina, so I don't catch more than maybe one a day.
[02:01:59.144 --> 02:02:03.788]  And maybe it's 8 o'clock at night, the kids have done their homework, they've taken showers, had dinner.
[02:02:04.844 --> 02:02:08.187]  And we don't watch a lot of TV, we watch movies a couple times a week or whatever.
[02:02:08.187 --> 02:02:15.333]  And I let them watch a few shows here and there when they've done their chores and done a good job and gotten straight A's.
[02:02:15.333 --> 02:02:20.718]  But we'll all just sit down and my 8-year-old, my 12-year-old daughter and my 14-year-old son and I say, what do you want to watch?
[02:02:20.718 --> 02:02:27.424]  And they say, we want to go to the Donald Trump channel on YouTube and we want to watch his speech today.
[02:02:27.424 --> 02:02:31.688]  And we'll go there and we'll, oh look there's five speeches today, which one would you like to watch?
[02:02:33.168 --> 02:02:36.650]  And we'll sit down and we'll watch Donald Trump for 30 minutes or an hour.
[02:02:36.650 --> 02:02:38.551]  My children, they all teach you.
[02:02:38.551 --> 02:02:39.852]  Your kids don't want to listen to you.
[02:02:39.852 --> 02:02:42.814]  Your kids don't want to admire you.
[02:02:42.814 --> 02:02:44.255]  You study history.
[02:02:44.255 --> 02:02:48.738]  You're fighting evil and you're in a tribal situation and your kids understand it.
[02:02:48.738 --> 02:02:50.299]  All they want to do is do what you say.
[02:02:51.348 --> 02:02:55.672]  They want to get our families destabilized from the beginning, all fighting with each other.
[02:02:55.672 --> 02:03:08.082]  Once they get the unnatural dynamic going, once they try to convince the man to act like a child, the woman to act like she's the boss, and get everything destabilized, once that starts, it's like a top, a gyro wobbling.
[02:03:08.082 --> 02:03:11.325]  A gyro that's stable is going perfect.
[02:03:11.325 --> 02:03:13.187]  A gyro that's wobbling, it's out of control.
[02:03:14.676 --> 02:03:18.137]  And once kids get it that we're a family, we've got to stick together.
[02:03:18.137 --> 02:03:19.658]  We care about each other.
[02:03:19.658 --> 02:03:24.159]  And we only care about people that care about us and the people that are truthful and nice.
[02:03:24.159 --> 02:03:26.780]  And not that my kids are perfect.
[02:03:26.780 --> 02:03:27.340]  They're far from it.
[02:03:27.340 --> 02:03:34.122]  I've spoiled them at certain levels, but they went all the... everything.
[02:03:34.122 --> 02:03:35.823]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:03:35.823 --> 02:03:38.944]  He could do it at state level if he wanted to, but he didn't need to.
[02:03:39.924 --> 02:03:41.144]  Uh, but Rex is now a man.
[02:03:41.144 --> 02:03:42.305]  He hasn't been on the air in over a year.
[02:03:42.305 --> 02:03:44.685]  He's been so busy, but he wants to be on air.
[02:03:44.685 --> 02:03:48.426]  He's on air soon, but he looks like he's about 16, 17.
[02:03:48.426 --> 02:03:48.546]  He's 14.
[02:03:48.546 --> 02:03:50.086]  He just turned 14.
[02:03:50.086 --> 02:03:52.207]  And he wins all the big speech debate deals.
[02:03:52.207 --> 02:03:55.828]  He wins all the big... I mean, you name it.
[02:03:55.828 --> 02:03:59.068]  Um... And I'm not bragging about my kids.
[02:03:59.068 --> 02:04:00.229]  It's just that they're confident.
[02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:02.169]  They know what's going on in the world.
[02:04:02.169 --> 02:04:04.129]  They got a gleam in their eye.
[02:04:04.129 --> 02:04:06.070]  Look at the average kid that gleam's been stolen from.
[02:04:07.421 --> 02:04:09.622]  And I don't let my kids play video games, folks.
[02:04:09.622 --> 02:04:14.004]  I don't let them sit there and just sit there with a smartphone all day and drool.
[02:04:14.004 --> 02:04:17.086]  I have phones I give to them when they're going somewhere or I don't know where they're at.
[02:04:17.086 --> 02:04:17.806]  It's like Big Brother.
[02:04:17.806 --> 02:04:19.327]  The government's gonna watch you, I'm gonna watch you too.
[02:04:19.327 --> 02:04:19.828]  Here, go with this.
[02:04:19.828 --> 02:04:21.889]  Are you gonna do a sleepover?
[02:04:21.889 --> 02:04:22.829]  Boom, take this with you.
[02:04:22.829 --> 02:04:23.990]  But it's like a weapon.
[02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:24.810]  It's like an evil.
[02:04:24.810 --> 02:04:31.654]  We roll out for limited uses, you know, because we have ways of turning that towards good.
[02:04:31.654 --> 02:04:32.914]  At least we believe we do.
[02:04:32.914 --> 02:04:33.695]  None of us are perfect.
[02:04:39.189 --> 02:04:39.850]  It's actually true.
[02:04:39.850 --> 02:04:40.850]  The country is done.
[02:04:40.850 --> 02:04:42.972]  The world's done.
[02:04:42.972 --> 02:04:47.435]  If the Brexit fails, if Europe continues the EU, and if Trump doesn't get in.
[02:04:47.435 --> 02:04:50.577]  I mean, if nationalism and patriotism doesn't win.
[02:04:50.577 --> 02:04:52.418]  Because globalism is pure death.
[02:04:52.418 --> 02:04:53.699]  Globalism is world government.
[02:04:53.699 --> 02:04:55.680]  Globalism is scientific tyranny.
[02:04:55.680 --> 02:04:56.261]  It's the enemy.
[02:05:00.100 --> 02:05:07.783]  The Japanese coastline has been struck again and the Fukushima reactor cooling system, it stops flowing amid the quake and tsunami that followed.
[02:05:07.783 --> 02:05:11.725]  Damaged nuclear plant, it struggles after this latest natural disaster.
[02:05:11.725 --> 02:05:20.628]  Now the cooling system of the third reactor at the Fukushima nuclear plant has stopped circulating water following a powerful 7.3 offshore earthquake this week.
[02:05:20.928 --> 02:05:32.973]  Tepco said that it managed to restart the system some 90 minutes after its failure, and the cooling system servicing the Unit 3 spent fuel pool was not able to circulate water to cool nuclear fuel because of a broken pump.
[02:05:32.973 --> 02:05:35.754]  All of this is according to the Nuclear Regulatory Agency.
[02:05:35.754 --> 02:05:47.238]  It turns out that this plant for the second time has been hit, and the immediate danger, although the agency admitted gradual rising temperatures, the exact cause of this cooling system stoppage is currently unknown.
[02:05:47.238 --> 02:05:48.999]  Now, we've highlighted this on InfoWars,
[02:05:49.079 --> 02:05:54.672]  Please check out our reports for more information regarding this latest quake and how it impacts the days coming forward.
[02:05:54.672 --> 02:05:57.278]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:05:59.744 --> 02:06:02.407]  I want to tell you about a brand new off-the-grid product.
[02:06:02.407 --> 02:06:04.569]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[02:06:04.569 --> 02:06:10.295]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110 appliances at your house.
[02:06:10.295 --> 02:06:13.398]  Like small refrigerators to keep your food from spoiling.
[02:06:13.398 --> 02:06:15.921]  The best part though, you can take it with you.
[02:06:15.921 --> 02:06:16.622]  It's mobile.
[02:06:16.622 --> 02:06:21.327]  To jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[02:06:21.767 --> 02:06:25.489]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity.
[02:06:25.489 --> 02:06:28.931]  Basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[02:06:28.931 --> 02:06:29.951]  A true innovation.
[02:06:29.951 --> 02:06:32.032]  I have never seen anything like this.
[02:06:32.032 --> 02:06:33.733]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[02:06:33.733 --> 02:06:36.274]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[02:06:36.274 --> 02:06:37.995]  It's even a great Christmas idea.
[02:06:38.175 --> 02:06:38.575]  I don't know.
[02:06:59.660 --> 02:07:07.128]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[02:07:07.128 --> 02:07:20.363]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[02:07:21.284 --> 02:07:33.175]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[02:07:33.175 --> 02:07:39.140]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[02:07:39.881 --> 02:07:48.912]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[02:07:48.912 --> 02:07:57.083]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[02:08:09.743 --> 02:08:12.214]  People should not be afraid of their governments.
[02:08:12.214 --> 02:08:14.002]  Governments should be afraid
[02:08:40.467 --> 02:08:42.210]  I'm excited!
[02:08:42.210 --> 02:08:50.064]  Several party members have been murdered, Jesus Christ.
[02:08:51.647 --> 02:08:56.171]  We're interrupting your regularly scheduled program to bring you this terrifying report.
[02:08:56.171 --> 02:08:59.173]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[02:08:59.173 --> 02:09:01.175]  It just pancaked.
[02:09:01.175 --> 02:09:04.978]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[02:09:04.978 --> 02:09:08.000]  New York, very much a city still in chaos.
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:12.324]  The phones are not working properly, the subway lines are not working properly.
[02:09:12.324 --> 02:09:17.088]  The sky now blank with smoke in front of us, just across the Tigris River here.
[02:09:17.668 --> 02:09:22.171]  This is shock and awe, Tom, to the population of Baghdad.
[02:09:22.171 --> 02:09:24.813]  Shock and awe, indeed.
[02:09:24.813 --> 02:09:30.798]  The people you liberate will witness the honorable and decent spirit of the American military.
[02:09:30.798 --> 02:09:33.780]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:09:36.946 --> 02:09:38.367]  It is a big idea.
[02:09:38.367 --> 02:09:40.208]  A new world order.
[02:09:40.208 --> 02:09:42.188]  I love my dad.
[02:09:42.188 --> 02:09:43.189]  I'd kill for him.
[02:09:43.189 --> 02:09:45.610]  I'd go to prison for him because I love him so much.
[02:09:45.610 --> 02:09:46.671]  I love Bill Clinton.
[02:09:46.671 --> 02:09:49.792]  What does that make Hillary Clinton to the Bush family?
[02:09:49.792 --> 02:09:50.692]  My sister-in-law.
[02:09:50.692 --> 02:09:56.415]  When you are subverting the power of government, that's a fundamentally dangerous thing to democracy.
[02:09:56.415 --> 02:09:57.956]  What do you think of Edward Snowden?
[02:09:58.516 --> 02:09:59.917]  I think he's a traitor.
[02:09:59.917 --> 02:10:01.779]  Obama is the one that kills the U.S.
[02:10:01.779 --> 02:10:03.720]  troops if the Russians bomb any of them.
[02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:05.582]  Obama is the one that put them in harm's way.
[02:10:05.582 --> 02:10:08.024]  Obama is the one using them as human shields.
[02:10:08.024 --> 02:10:12.267]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate, criminal government in American history.
[02:10:12.267 --> 02:10:13.368]  I'm here to warn people!
[02:10:13.368 --> 02:10:14.930]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[02:10:14.930 --> 02:10:15.770]  This isn't a game!
[02:10:15.770 --> 02:10:20.835]  Get him out!
[02:10:20.835 --> 02:10:21.215]  Get him out!
[02:10:21.215 --> 02:10:21.775]  Get him out!
[02:10:21.775 --> 02:10:22.616]  Welcome to America, ISIS!
[02:10:22.616 --> 02:10:23.357]  This is what we do!
[02:10:23.357 --> 02:10:23.417]  Woo!
[02:10:24.548 --> 02:10:27.571]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[02:10:27.571 --> 02:10:29.312]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[02:10:29.312 --> 02:10:31.054]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[02:10:31.054 --> 02:10:40.602]  In 2012, your agency was saying, quote, the Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Al-Qaeda in Iraq are the major forces driving the insurgents in Syria.
[02:10:40.602 --> 02:10:44.785]  In 2012, the US was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups.
[02:10:44.785 --> 02:10:45.846]  Why did you not stop that?
[02:10:45.846 --> 02:10:47.327]  Why didn't you come forward before?
[02:10:47.327 --> 02:10:48.649]  What were you waiting for?
[02:10:48.649 --> 02:10:50.030]  Well, for you, Inspector.
[02:10:58.434 --> 02:11:01.856]  I suddenly had this feeling that everything was connected.
[02:11:01.856 --> 02:11:08.520]  We're all part of it.
[02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:11.482]  Are we ready for it?
[02:11:11.482 --> 02:11:16.445]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:11:22.338 --> 02:11:25.279]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are all part of it.
[02:11:25.279 --> 02:11:26.119]  History is happening.
[02:11:26.119 --> 02:11:30.921]  Donald Trump has said the future of this country surviving is on the line.
[02:11:30.921 --> 02:11:35.202]  Not that he's perfect, he'll tell you that, but that the globalists are ending national sovereignty.
[02:11:35.202 --> 02:11:42.605]  World government has been announced, and thank God he came along who had the courage to magnify our work, Ron Paul's work, your work.
[02:11:43.487 --> 02:11:44.890]  It's now mainstream.
[02:11:44.890 --> 02:11:48.016]  And there are nationalist movements around the world moving forward.
[02:11:48.016 --> 02:11:54.429]  Notice since Nigel Farage of UKIP, we've been interviewing for 15 years, met with Trump.
[02:11:55.600 --> 02:11:57.181]  And has actually been staying in the U.S.
[02:11:57.181 --> 02:12:00.342]  coaching him since the disastrous first debate.
[02:12:00.342 --> 02:12:13.048]  Trump's gotten ten times more hardcore against the globalists and how it's about sovereignty and outside interests like Carlos Slim of Mexico, really an Arab, and the Communist Chinese and the Islamists, the Saudi Arabians, controlling us.
[02:12:13.048 --> 02:12:16.029]  Notice Trump suddenly has become laser beam.
[02:12:16.029 --> 02:12:17.630]  Very powerful.
[02:12:17.630 --> 02:12:18.971]  And that's because Farage
[02:12:20.836 --> 02:12:24.858]  He is basically as informed as I am or even more.
[02:12:24.858 --> 02:12:26.039]  I've had dinner with him.
[02:12:26.039 --> 02:12:27.560]  I've known him for years.
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:29.021]  He was obviously on the show just a few weeks ago.
[02:12:29.021 --> 02:12:30.061]  We've done taped interviews with him.
[02:12:30.061 --> 02:12:32.043]  We're going to be talking to him again next week.
[02:12:32.043 --> 02:12:33.383]  Farage gets the whole deal.
[02:12:33.383 --> 02:12:35.905]  He's the guy that helped begin the fall of the EU.
[02:12:35.905 --> 02:12:41.248]  Now, every EU country is demanding a referendum because no one was allowed to have a referendum.
[02:12:41.248 --> 02:12:44.570]  You're just suddenly under the EU because your politicians sell you out.
[02:12:44.570 --> 02:12:49.953]  Like Obama's saying, we're under the TPP and the carbon tax even if we don't ratify it.
[02:12:51.527 --> 02:12:54.670]  The media's like, Obama's smart, he doesn't need Congress, he's just gonna ratify it.
[02:12:54.670 --> 02:13:01.196]  Well, it's not smart to break the law, it's not smart to just have the bureaucracy do whatever it wants.
[02:13:01.196 --> 02:13:06.081]  But that's the big widespread, you know, 40,000, 35,000 foot view.
[02:13:06.081 --> 02:13:09.985]  It's important to zoom in and do snapshots of different individuals.
[02:13:09.985 --> 02:13:12.007]  Now, I'm not one to defend Bill Clinton.
[02:13:13.234 --> 02:13:15.637]  But I've been covering the Clintons for 21 years on air.
[02:13:15.637 --> 02:13:21.865]  I've been following them for 23 years since they became, you know, husband and, or since that election in 1992, 1993.
[02:13:26.147 --> 02:13:28.750]  And Hillary, to me, is the main villain.
[02:13:28.750 --> 02:13:36.579]  And I don't say that because that's a campaign strategy and, you know, we'll talk about Bill, how bad he is, but how she's even worse.
[02:13:36.579 --> 02:13:37.040]  It's the truth.
[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:37.501]  It's come out.
[02:13:37.501 --> 02:13:40.664]  She was president already, basically eight years, co-president.
[02:13:40.664 --> 02:13:43.047]  She is the one that handled the quote, bimbo eruptions.
[02:13:44.008 --> 02:13:51.392]  She is the one that's actually out doing the work and making the money and selling the country out, as we see in the Clinton Foundation.
[02:13:51.392 --> 02:13:54.813]  Bill's spending most of his time partying and he does do some work, obviously.
[02:13:54.813 --> 02:13:57.495]  He's now a surrogate for her because she's obviously ill.
[02:13:57.495 --> 02:14:04.658]  But looking at what just comes out and all the horrible things Hillary does in these WikiLeaks and how she hates the American people is mind-boggling.
[02:14:04.658 --> 02:14:09.401]  But we had a lady on, one of the many folks that have been connected to the Clintons who've spoken out.
[02:14:10.077 --> 02:14:11.779]  But I wanted to have her here in person.
[02:14:11.779 --> 02:14:13.741]  I appreciate her coming down from Arkansas.
[02:14:13.741 --> 02:14:17.325]  A lovely lady, both in her looks, but also in her demeanor.
[02:14:17.325 --> 02:14:21.649]  Because she really, I thought, connected with myself and the audience.
[02:14:21.649 --> 02:14:23.371]  She's not somebody that says Bill Clinton raped her.
[02:14:23.371 --> 02:14:29.097]  She's somebody that dated Bill Clinton, but can speak to the whole situation really from a very honest perspective.
[02:14:29.958 --> 02:14:30.459]  We're good to go.
[02:14:46.616 --> 02:14:49.058]  Dolly Kyle, a political memoir.
[02:14:49.058 --> 02:14:53.963]  Hillary, the other woman, forwarded by David P. Shepard, who's a great patriot.
[02:14:53.963 --> 02:14:59.608]  He was the head impeachment lawyer who exposed that actually Ken Starr was a Chinese agent.
[02:15:00.530 --> 02:15:00.730]  I don't
[02:15:17.188 --> 02:15:18.729]  There has to be absolute accountability.
[02:15:18.729 --> 02:15:20.050]  That's a Hillary Clinton quote.
[02:15:20.050 --> 02:15:20.931]  You're a great writer.
[02:15:20.931 --> 02:15:25.155]  Dolly promises me you will never censor anything you might want to say.
[02:15:25.155 --> 02:15:26.316]  Bill Clinton.
[02:15:26.316 --> 02:15:28.478]  Dolly is keeping her promise not to censor the truth.
[02:15:28.478 --> 02:15:30.219]  She is telling the whole truth here.
[02:15:30.219 --> 02:15:31.820]  But Hillary will not be happy about it.
[02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:38.206]  Hillary is the one being called to account for her lies, shady financial deals, racial discrimination.
[02:15:40.067 --> 02:15:40.847]  One chef got killed.
[02:15:40.847 --> 02:15:42.128]  The other chef's come out and said it's true.
[02:15:42.128 --> 02:15:44.009]  She would just scream N-word and flip out.
[02:15:44.009 --> 02:15:57.359]  Foul mouth, flip-flopping, destruction of government records from Arkansas to Washington to Benghazi, lack of true feminist credentials, and her decades-long history of attacking many women who were used and abused by her husband, the co-president.
[02:15:57.359 --> 02:16:04.444]  I'm going to skip this network break because we have more time with Dolly Kyle here today, but thank you so much for coming in the studio with us.
[02:16:04.784 --> 02:16:05.705]  Well, you're very welcome.
[02:16:05.705 --> 02:16:07.006]  I'm happy to be here, Alex.
[02:16:07.006 --> 02:16:07.546]  You're awesome.
[02:16:07.546 --> 02:16:08.707]  Wow.
[02:16:08.707 --> 02:16:10.008]  I mean, I've thrown a lot out there.
[02:16:10.008 --> 02:16:15.292]  You should probably just recap for folks that didn't hear you on a few months ago, who you are, what happened, what unfolded.
[02:16:15.292 --> 02:16:18.414]  I ran to you in Cleveland at the RNC as well.
[02:16:18.414 --> 02:16:24.578]  And then just your perspective of somebody who's been there since what, high school or was even earlier with Bill Clinton?
[02:16:24.578 --> 02:16:25.319]  Right.
[02:16:25.319 --> 02:16:27.480]  I met Billy when I was 11 and he was 12 going on 13.
[02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:27.861]  So middle school.
[02:16:30.441 --> 02:16:34.282]  Yeah, well, I went to Catholic school, so we didn't break it up like that.
[02:16:34.282 --> 02:16:37.423]  Eighth grade, but then there were no other Catholic schools there.
[02:16:37.423 --> 02:16:40.584]  But Billy was, we were in Hot Springs High School together then.
[02:16:40.584 --> 02:16:44.945]  We graduated in 64, so we're in the same class.
[02:16:44.945 --> 02:16:49.906]  And yes, I am two years younger because I skipped two grades.
[02:16:49.906 --> 02:16:52.787]  So let's get the bimbo thing out of the way right now, okay?
[02:16:52.787 --> 02:16:53.547]  No bimbo here.
[02:16:53.547 --> 02:16:54.427]  I am a lawyer.
[02:16:54.427 --> 02:16:56.728]  Well, you don't look like a bimbo, and you look amazing for your age.
[02:16:56.728 --> 02:16:57.468]  You look like you're about 45.
[02:16:58.348 --> 02:16:58.948]  I'll take it.
[02:16:58.948 --> 02:16:59.428]  Thank you.
[02:16:59.428 --> 02:17:02.770]  No, I'm joking.
[02:17:02.770 --> 02:17:13.933]  Anyway, the important thing is really not so much the fact that I had an adult sexual relationship with Billy, but the fact that I have known him since I was 11 years old.
[02:17:13.933 --> 02:17:18.755]  And I am an intelligent, observant person.
[02:17:18.755 --> 02:17:22.236]  And I know what's been going on with the Clintons for all these years.
[02:17:22.236 --> 02:17:23.657]  So that's what's important.
[02:17:23.657 --> 02:17:25.897]  I did not want to write this book, Alex.
[02:17:25.897 --> 02:17:27.278]  But when I saw Hillary,
[02:17:27.998 --> 02:17:35.742]  Look into the camera and get that fake sincere look that she has, and say that women who've been raped and sexually assaulted should be believed.
[02:17:35.742 --> 02:17:37.223]  Okay, that did it for me.
[02:17:37.223 --> 02:17:39.364]  I was ready to throw a shoe at the TV screen.
[02:17:39.364 --> 02:17:43.987]  But it was a new TV, and it wouldn't have done me any good, so I wrote this book instead.
[02:17:43.987 --> 02:17:46.228]  And I just started it last year, at the beginning.
[02:17:46.228 --> 02:17:48.449]  And you're on record, you know, in the yearbooks with Clinton.
[02:17:48.449 --> 02:17:51.691]  I mean, I don't think he's really, he's not denied that you were his girlfriend either.
[02:17:52.251 --> 02:17:55.314]  Well, actually... Early on he didn't.
[02:17:55.314 --> 02:18:00.398]  Early on, of course he didn't, but then I was subpoenaed to testify in the Paula Jones case.
[02:18:00.398 --> 02:18:09.185]  And Billy's lawyers wanted me to not testify, not because we didn't have a relationship, but because our relationship was consensual.
[02:18:09.185 --> 02:18:11.727]  And the Jones case was about sexual harassment.
[02:18:11.727 --> 02:18:17.132]  So Billy's own lawyers prepared an affidavit for me to sign saying that our relationship was consensual.
[02:18:17.612 --> 02:18:26.918]  And they wanted me to file a motion in federal court not to testify because I didn't know about harassment, only about these consensual sex.
[02:18:26.918 --> 02:18:35.363]  The problem that Billy's lawyers did not know was that I was going to testify about Billy's sex addiction, which he had confessed to me.
[02:18:35.363 --> 02:18:43.508]  After, Alex, I found out I was a sex addict and I got into therapy and I told Billy about that as any friend would do.
[02:18:44.500 --> 02:18:46.982]  Well, it must be a terrible thing to be a sex addict.
[02:18:46.982 --> 02:18:53.528]  Well, actually, Alex, anyone who can have a drink at a cocktail party and enjoy it thinks that alcohol is fine.
[02:18:53.528 --> 02:18:55.710]  I have nothing against alcohol.
[02:18:55.710 --> 02:19:01.314]  But if you take one drink and you can't stop and you ruin your life, then it's not so great.
[02:19:01.314 --> 02:19:02.636]  Absolutely not.
[02:19:02.636 --> 02:19:03.937]  I mean, what is a sex addict?
[02:19:03.937 --> 02:19:05.098]  Somebody who just can't control themselves?
[02:19:06.027 --> 02:19:09.790]  There are a lot of aspects of it, just as there are different kinds of alcoholics.
[02:19:09.790 --> 02:19:13.574]  And I say alcoholics because more people have more experience with that, more knowledge of it.
[02:19:13.574 --> 02:19:17.177]  There's an alcoholic who gets up in the morning and has alcohol for breakfast.
[02:19:17.177 --> 02:19:19.279]  There's one who doesn't drink until five o'clock.
[02:19:19.279 --> 02:19:20.800]  There's one who binges on the weekends.
[02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:22.742]  There's one who binges every six months.
[02:19:22.742 --> 02:19:24.764]  There's all different sorts of alcoholism.
[02:19:24.764 --> 02:19:28.547]  But it does not excuse someone driving down the street drunk and killing a person.
[02:19:28.547 --> 02:19:29.408]  No, no, I totally agree with you.
[02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:33.952]  I mean, Bill Clinton isn't admitted like superstar sex addict.
[02:19:33.952 --> 02:19:35.853]  I mean, what's the word on it?
[02:19:35.853 --> 02:19:38.435]  Reportedly up to 10 women a day when he was president.
[02:19:38.435 --> 02:19:40.596]  Well, I don't know how many women per day.
[02:19:40.596 --> 02:19:49.423]  I do know that once a long time ago, we were discussing Wilt Chamberlain, who was the African-American basketball star who said he'd had sex with 20,000 women.
[02:19:49.423 --> 02:19:55.808]  And Billy and I were talking about that and he said, whoa, that's 10 times more than I've had.
[02:19:55.808 --> 02:19:58.690]  And I think he said that with a bit of admiration and a little jealousy.
[02:19:59.304 --> 02:20:00.345]  Well, he was saying he really had 2,000.
[02:20:00.345 --> 02:20:04.549]  Yeah, and let's say he was exaggerating and it was only 1,000.
[02:20:04.549 --> 02:20:06.831]  How's that?
[02:20:06.831 --> 02:20:07.832]  Better?
[02:20:07.832 --> 02:20:09.233]  I don't think so.
[02:20:09.233 --> 02:20:12.716]  I think any man wants to find is the right person.
[02:20:12.716 --> 02:20:15.198]  There's one and that's who you love.
[02:20:15.198 --> 02:20:16.520]  Well, I don't think he knows about love.
[02:20:17.571 --> 02:20:20.972]  Well, I can say personally, just raw sex for me is empty.
[02:20:20.972 --> 02:20:23.313]  I was a little bit promiscuous when I was younger.
[02:20:23.313 --> 02:20:25.333]  Nothing like Will Chamberlain or Bill Clinton.
[02:20:25.333 --> 02:20:26.734]  But it just was so empty.
[02:20:26.734 --> 02:20:30.014]  And for me, sex is really all about the relationship.
[02:20:30.014 --> 02:20:31.115]  It should be.
[02:20:31.115 --> 02:20:40.237]  And what happened, and I'm not excusing it, but when I was a 16-year-old virgin, I was drugged and raped by one of Billy Clinton's friends.
[02:20:40.237 --> 02:20:43.338]  And a rape will change the trajectory of someone's life.
[02:20:43.338 --> 02:20:45.139]  Now, sometimes people don't admit it.
[02:20:46.579 --> 02:20:50.241]  Even admit to themselves what happened in this, in the effect.
[02:20:50.241 --> 02:20:54.663]  Does it mean that either person becomes very withdrawn and a spinster or they become wild?
[02:20:54.663 --> 02:20:56.203]  Well, that's what I talk about in my book.
[02:20:56.203 --> 02:20:59.685]  Yes.
[02:20:59.685 --> 02:21:01.085]  And again, that's Hillary, the other woman.
[02:21:01.085 --> 02:21:04.087]  So, so going back to where you started, that was intriguing.
[02:21:04.087 --> 02:21:15.872]  You were suddenly, when was it you were spurred into action, spurred into the spotlight because of Hillary and the way she was behaving, you know, claiming we should always stand up for women that are assaulted, but then going after Bill's victims.
[02:21:16.232 --> 02:21:19.094]  Well, that was just at the beginning of 2016.
[02:21:19.094 --> 02:21:23.836]  I mean, I wrote 92,000 words in 65 days of writing.
[02:21:23.836 --> 02:21:25.277]  I did take off on Sundays.
[02:21:25.277 --> 02:21:31.681]  I also want to say to anyone who wants to start throwing stones right now, that having the affair with Billy was wrong.
[02:21:32.361 --> 02:21:38.167]  I have repented, I have changed my life, and I had invited him to do that too, but that hasn't happened yet.
[02:21:38.167 --> 02:21:41.850]  Yeah, well nobody's judging anybody for consensual sex, even though I can't get it out of hand.
[02:21:41.850 --> 02:21:43.452]  I think you're saying it was out of hand.
[02:21:43.452 --> 02:21:44.032]  Absolutely.
[02:21:44.032 --> 02:21:46.775]  Nobody's judging you for, I mean, give me a break.
[02:21:46.775 --> 02:21:52.400]  And anybody that tries, especially the left, they're all, oh, sex party, all this degenerate stuff, but then they act like...
[02:21:53.191 --> 02:21:59.555]  You know, like these super obsessed, you know, orthodox people when somebody conservative is involved in it.
[02:21:59.555 --> 02:22:02.596]  It seems like a very, very one-sided situation.
[02:22:02.596 --> 02:22:03.657]  Well, it absolutely is.
[02:22:03.657 --> 02:22:04.998]  And here's the other thing.
[02:22:04.998 --> 02:22:12.302]  Forget the sexual relationship that I had with Billy because my entire family, he's been friends with the Clintons family for years.
[02:22:12.302 --> 02:22:18.345]  So I have an inside observation whether or not Billy and I ever had a relationship.
[02:22:18.345 --> 02:22:21.127]  Has Bill Clinton gotten more evil or less evil over time?
[02:22:21.676 --> 02:22:22.537]  Oh my goodness.
[02:22:22.537 --> 02:22:29.842]  You know, I didn't know anything was wrong with him until the night in 1974 when he introduced me to Hillary.
[02:22:29.842 --> 02:22:33.245]  And that was the night of the Democrat convention in Arkansas.
[02:22:33.245 --> 02:22:37.408]  And Hillary had come in from Washington, but I did not know that.
[02:22:37.408 --> 02:22:46.355]  Billy called and asked me to pick him up at the airport and wanted me to take him to the television headquarters and then to Fulbright headquarters.
[02:22:47.717 --> 02:22:48.318]  I said, sure.
[02:22:48.318 --> 02:22:49.319]  I mean, it's no big deal.
[02:22:49.319 --> 02:22:50.240]  We were adults.
[02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:51.221]  We were dating.
[02:22:51.221 --> 02:22:52.843]  I was divorced at that time.
[02:22:52.843 --> 02:22:56.468]  And so it was a totally open sexual relationship.
[02:22:56.468 --> 02:22:58.550]  He was also seeing Marla Crider at the university.
[02:22:58.550 --> 02:22:59.512]  That's pretty wild, though.
[02:22:59.512 --> 02:23:02.035]  He's got a hot blonde going over to pick up his other girlfriend.
[02:23:02.597 --> 02:23:03.998]  Well, yeah, but I didn't know that.
[02:23:03.998 --> 02:23:05.278]  And so he showed up at the airport.
[02:23:05.278 --> 02:23:06.399]  So he's pretty bold.
[02:23:06.399 --> 02:23:10.481]  He showed up at the airport with this dowdy-looking middle-aged woman and three guys in suits.
[02:23:10.481 --> 02:23:16.244]  And when they got closer, I realized that the dowdy middle-aged woman was just dowdy, but not middle-aged.
[02:23:16.244 --> 02:23:19.486]  And Billy said, Dolly, this is Hillary.
[02:23:19.486 --> 02:23:21.587]  Hillary Dolly.
[02:23:21.587 --> 02:23:24.048]  Did he tell you she was a CIA officer?
[02:23:24.696 --> 02:23:26.417]  Oh no, no.
[02:23:26.417 --> 02:23:27.898]  He didn't say anything about that.
[02:23:27.898 --> 02:23:44.429]  And one thing that you need to understand about Billy and all other addicts is that they will tell different people different things so that they never expose themselves, excuse the pun, completely to anyone, but they show different sides of themselves.
[02:23:44.429 --> 02:23:51.654]  For example, Billy showed his cocaine addiction to other people, but not to me because he knew I was very definitely against drugs.
[02:23:51.654 --> 02:23:52.935]  So he wouldn't bring that up.
[02:23:52.935 --> 02:23:54.396]  He could show his sex addiction to me.
[02:23:55.097 --> 02:23:57.579]  Because that was okay, because I understood that.
[02:23:57.579 --> 02:23:58.861]  So he was a chameleon?
[02:23:58.861 --> 02:23:59.662]  Absolutely.
[02:23:59.662 --> 02:24:00.883]  Okay, so we got to this part.
[02:24:00.883 --> 02:24:04.848]  It's the first time, 1974, Democrat convention happened in Arkansas.
[02:24:04.848 --> 02:24:07.391]  Here comes Hillary with the guys in suits with her.
[02:24:07.391 --> 02:24:08.192]  Tell us what happens next.
[02:24:08.902 --> 02:24:11.803]  Well, my first thought was, oh dear.
[02:24:11.803 --> 02:24:15.004]  Remember the Seinfeld episode with the valet parker who smelled bad?
[02:24:15.004 --> 02:24:16.024]  Yes.
[02:24:16.024 --> 02:24:20.146]  Well, the first thing I thought was, oh my gosh, I have cloth seats in my car.
[02:24:20.146 --> 02:24:23.206]  And believe me, I was worried about my car.
[02:24:23.206 --> 02:24:25.727]  But I let this woman get in there anyway.
[02:24:25.727 --> 02:24:27.048]  She smelled that bad?
[02:24:27.048 --> 02:24:28.468]  She really did, Alex.
[02:24:28.468 --> 02:24:29.989]  She really, truly did.
[02:24:29.989 --> 02:24:32.389]  And I'm not just being tacky.
[02:24:32.389 --> 02:24:34.210]  Call me Margaret Mead in Samoa.
[02:24:34.210 --> 02:24:37.471]  I had never seen or smelled any woman like that, ever.
[02:24:38.490 --> 02:24:40.731]  Did we talk before you got here today?
[02:24:40.731 --> 02:24:41.852]  No, why?
[02:24:41.852 --> 02:24:43.973]  When's the last time you talked to me?
[02:24:43.973 --> 02:24:45.674]  Well, I guess on the radio show?
[02:24:45.674 --> 02:24:46.474]  Yeah.
[02:24:46.474 --> 02:24:46.714]  Months ago?
[02:24:46.714 --> 02:24:48.135]  Because we fly by the seat of our pants.
[02:24:48.135 --> 02:24:48.975]  We're just boom, boom, boom.
[02:24:48.975 --> 02:24:49.936]  Yeah.
[02:24:49.936 --> 02:24:53.297]  It's a big national... Are you aware of the national controversy right now concerning me?
[02:24:53.297 --> 02:24:55.218]  I mean, the president responded to it.
[02:24:55.218 --> 02:24:56.319]  No, I don't think so.
[02:24:56.319 --> 02:24:56.739]  What happened?
[02:24:57.948 --> 02:24:59.350]  It was the top story three days ago.
[02:24:59.350 --> 02:25:08.941]  I just said from my secret service sources, and I also talked to people in protective detail from the Pentagon, they said, we don't know what's going on, but Hillary smells like a dead pig.
[02:25:10.035 --> 02:25:12.316]  And I talked about it, and they said I was completely insane.
[02:25:12.316 --> 02:25:15.297]  I said, she smells like a demon, and that Obama stinks to high heaven.
[02:25:15.297 --> 02:25:16.377]  Oh, I did hear that.
[02:25:16.377 --> 02:25:17.978]  Yes, about the demon thing.
[02:25:17.978 --> 02:25:18.318]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:25:18.318 --> 02:25:20.698]  Well, I don't know what a dead pig smells like.
[02:25:20.698 --> 02:25:21.099]  I do.
[02:25:21.099 --> 02:25:22.699]  Well, the point is, they smell like hell.
[02:25:22.699 --> 02:25:26.560]  But, but, it's funny, but, I don't know if you read about the book, but wow, that's crazy.
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:27.941]  I mean, you're bringing up how bad she smelled.
[02:25:27.941 --> 02:25:30.301]  I'm just telling you, people are telling me she smells.
[02:25:30.301 --> 02:25:31.442]  So, what's she smell like?
[02:25:32.242 --> 02:25:34.283]  I don't know, I've never smelled anything like that before.
[02:25:34.283 --> 02:25:38.086]  I mean, her hair was dirty and greasy and her dress was stained.
[02:25:38.086 --> 02:25:42.208]  So I assume it was something on her, in her, or she hadn't bathed.
[02:25:42.208 --> 02:25:47.091]  Listen, I've had two Blackwater people, an army colonel,
[02:25:48.192 --> 02:25:59.236]  Secret Service just say, we're scared of her, she blows up and screams half the time, fits, falls down angry, I mean like a two-year-old, and smells like, and I go, what?
[02:25:59.236 --> 02:26:00.876]  They go, it's the worst smell you've ever smelled.
[02:26:00.876 --> 02:26:03.137]  And I'm, it's just, you didn't even know this and here you are bringing it up.
[02:26:03.297 --> 02:26:06.399]  No, because it was one of the first things that I noticed.
[02:26:06.399 --> 02:26:09.260]  And who could not notice someone who smelled that bad?
[02:26:09.260 --> 02:26:11.481]  Especially when they were going to get in my car with cloth suits.
[02:26:11.481 --> 02:26:12.321]  That's what I tell listeners.
[02:26:12.321 --> 02:26:14.723]  I'm not going to make this up if we're not getting these sources.
[02:26:14.723 --> 02:26:18.344]  Well, ask anyone in Arkansas who met her back then.
[02:26:18.344 --> 02:26:19.505]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:26:19.505 --> 02:26:22.726]  This wasn't just normal hippie body odor.
[02:26:22.726 --> 02:26:23.687]  I wouldn't think so.
[02:26:25.177 --> 02:26:26.058]  All right, please continue.
[02:26:26.058 --> 02:26:26.618]  So what else?
[02:26:26.618 --> 02:26:28.259]  Did you see a stinking creature arriving?
[02:26:28.259 --> 02:26:35.504]  Well, the thing that really bothered me that night, I started to talk about, you said, is Billy more evil now.
[02:26:35.504 --> 02:26:42.648]  You would have to know how important Senator Bill Fulbright was in Billy Clinton's life in order to get this at the level that I do.
[02:26:42.648 --> 02:26:49.092]  But when Billy Clinton went to Georgetown as a freshman in 1964, Bill Fulbright gave him a job.
[02:26:49.092 --> 02:26:49.853]  Fulbright had been
[02:26:51.568 --> 02:26:51.788]  I don't
[02:27:03.740 --> 02:27:10.064]  Bill Fulbright helped him get the Rhodes Scholarship, he helped him to get into Yale, he helped him to get a job at the University of Arkansas teaching.
[02:27:10.064 --> 02:27:17.008]  And then when Billy, in 1974, was running for Congress from the 4th Congressional District in Northwest Arkansas.
[02:27:17.008 --> 02:27:17.829]  Got a good memory, huh?
[02:27:17.829 --> 02:27:23.032]  It was Bill Fulbright who introduced him to the big money folks who would support that race.
[02:27:23.032 --> 02:27:24.993]  So I say all that to say this.
[02:27:24.993 --> 02:27:26.514]  The night of May 28, 1974, the Democrat primary,
[02:27:28.795 --> 02:27:36.901]  I picked up Billy at the airport, we went to the TV station so Billy could do a statewide interview, which was the only place you could do that at the time, and maybe still now, I'm not sure.
[02:27:36.901 --> 02:27:50.652]  Anyway, while he was doing the interview, this strange smelling person who I really didn't believe was Hillary, I thought it was some kind of a joke, because Billy had told me two years before that he was moving in with a law student named Hillary, she had a place to live, no big deal.
[02:27:50.652 --> 02:27:53.014]  That's a toad looking creature with goggle glasses.
[02:27:53.014 --> 02:27:55.076]  Uh-huh, it was not pretty, it was not pretty.
[02:27:55.076 --> 02:27:56.457]  Smells like a pet of hell, dirty hair.
[02:27:57.037 --> 02:27:57.498]  Mm-hmm.
[02:27:57.498 --> 02:27:58.419]  All of that.
[02:27:58.419 --> 02:28:09.490]  Anyway, she was watching the election returns, and then when we left the TV station to go to Fulbright headquarters, Billy said, well, we need to go back to the airport.
[02:28:09.490 --> 02:28:10.371]  And I said, why?
[02:28:10.371 --> 02:28:11.813]  We're going to Fulbright headquarters.
[02:28:11.813 --> 02:28:12.614]  They're expecting you.
[02:28:12.614 --> 02:28:15.997]  I mean, you can't know this man Fulbright was like Billy's
[02:28:16.658 --> 02:28:18.018]  Godfather.
[02:28:18.018 --> 02:28:19.199]  No, not Godfather.
[02:28:19.199 --> 02:28:20.699]  Like a father he never had.
[02:28:20.699 --> 02:28:22.539]  It was critically important.
[02:28:22.539 --> 02:28:23.960]  And Billy said, well, we're not going.
[02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:25.400]  Didn't you see the election returns?
[02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:26.320]  Fulbright's losing.
[02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:28.180]  I said, yeah, sure, he's losing.
[02:28:28.180 --> 02:28:31.341]  I mean, all the more reason to go over and support him.
[02:28:31.341 --> 02:28:37.222]  And Billy said, I don't want to be seen with a loser.
[02:28:37.222 --> 02:28:39.963]  And I felt like I'd been kicked in the stomach.
[02:28:40.905 --> 02:28:42.706]  And of course I thought about, what about this?
[02:28:42.706 --> 02:28:45.307]  That's what I always hear, is they love to betray their friends.
[02:28:45.307 --> 02:28:47.068]  Now, at this point it begins.
[02:28:47.068 --> 02:28:48.368]  Well, yeah, and here's the thing.
[02:28:48.368 --> 02:28:52.770]  I was so upset about that, and of course I didn't realize that Hillary was Hillary.
[02:28:52.770 --> 02:28:54.451]  At the very least, I thought it was a joke.
[02:28:54.451 --> 02:28:55.792]  Really, I thought it was a joke.
[02:28:55.792 --> 02:28:58.553]  So I didn't realize Billy had kicked me in the gut.
[02:28:58.553 --> 02:29:03.255]  Can we pull up a photo of Hillary in college, or where she worked on the Nixon, anti-Nixon committee?
[02:29:03.255 --> 02:29:04.075]  I mean, let's pull her up.
[02:29:04.075 --> 02:29:04.936]  It looks like a joke.
[02:29:04.936 --> 02:29:05.776]  Please continue.
[02:29:05.776 --> 02:29:06.016]  Okay.
[02:29:08.761 --> 02:29:14.106]  I was devastated to realize that Billy would turn his back on Bill Fulbright like that.
[02:29:14.106 --> 02:29:14.807]  I really was.
[02:29:14.807 --> 02:29:16.449]  It made me physically sick.
[02:29:16.449 --> 02:29:24.737]  The same kind of physically sick I was when I saw Juanita Broderick's interview with Lisa Meyer on Dateline NBC and found out he was also a rapist.
[02:29:25.157 --> 02:29:26.758]  And we have those clips when we come back.
[02:29:26.758 --> 02:29:28.859]  So to you, it's the dishonor, Robin.
[02:29:28.859 --> 02:29:30.499]  Oh my gosh, yes.
[02:29:30.499 --> 02:29:30.960]  Well, it's funny.
[02:29:30.960 --> 02:29:33.281]  You know why Hillary had all those men in suits around her?
[02:29:33.281 --> 02:29:34.881]  She was... Oh, no, no, no, no.
[02:29:34.881 --> 02:29:35.942]  These were Billy's friends.
[02:29:35.942 --> 02:29:37.542]  This was not the guys in suits then.
[02:29:37.542 --> 02:29:38.463]  These were just Billy's friends.
[02:29:38.463 --> 02:29:39.583]  The point is, I mean, it's been declassified.
[02:29:39.583 --> 02:29:43.805]  She was like a CIA... his controller by the time they moved to England and all the rest of it later.
[02:29:43.805 --> 02:29:46.466]  And it's an amazing story.
[02:29:46.466 --> 02:29:48.087]  Her dad was like a mob boss in Chicago.
[02:29:49.266 --> 02:29:52.255]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.255 --> 02:29:55.885]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.063 --> 02:30:06.765]  Well it looks like President-elect Donald Trump is making good on his promises day one of the Trump presidency to withdraw from the TPP.
[02:30:06.765 --> 02:30:10.806]  We have an article that's up on our website Infowars.com and aggregated from CNS News.
[02:30:10.806 --> 02:30:16.988]  It talks about how Trump characterized the move a part of a plan to advance the simple core principle of quote putting America first.
[02:30:16.988 --> 02:30:28.451]  Of course that's been his credo down with globalism the entire campaign and now that President-elect Donald Trump who said on Monday that his first day in office next January will be to begin the process of withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[02:30:28.831 --> 02:30:29.091]  We're good.
[02:30:58.931 --> 02:31:00.613]  Hey, everyone.

[02:33:11.867 --> 02:33:13.750]  It's Friday, October 14th, 2016.
[02:33:13.750 --> 02:33:20.560]  We are now only 24 short days out from the November 8th election.
[02:33:20.560 --> 02:33:23.705]  It's time to kick the resistance into high gear.
[02:33:50.843 --> 02:33:56.009]  I was just talking to Dolly Kyle, and she's nervous to say this, but I was looking at her because I know she went to law school.
[02:33:56.009 --> 02:34:00.213]  One of the top folks in her class, she's very successful economically.
[02:34:00.213 --> 02:34:03.217]  She didn't want to come out and write this book with WorldNet Daily Books.
[02:34:03.217 --> 02:34:05.419]  She did it because she felt compelled to do it.
[02:34:05.419 --> 02:34:12.266]  And she said, well, I mean, I was going from memory because I knew that from inside baseball, knowing the publishers that you basically don't even want any money.
[02:34:13.067 --> 02:34:14.588]  Because they've asked me to publish a book with them, too.
[02:34:14.588 --> 02:34:16.470]  I've just been too busy, quite frankly.
[02:34:16.470 --> 02:34:18.211]  Great publishers over at WorldNetDailyBooks.
[02:34:18.211 --> 02:34:22.154]  Get the book, Hillary, The Other Woman, Dolly Kyle.
[02:34:22.154 --> 02:34:25.016]  Total credibility.
[02:34:25.016 --> 02:34:28.138]  We should go through your curriculum, Vitae, for new listeners.
[02:34:28.138 --> 02:34:29.419]  You're not doing this to sell a book.
[02:34:29.419 --> 02:34:36.624]  You're doing it to try to wake people up and expose what happens if we let these criminals continue to be in power.
[02:34:36.624 --> 02:34:38.706]  And you said, well, yes, I can't do it on your show.
[02:34:39.406 --> 02:34:40.907]  Because you're too big.
[02:34:40.907 --> 02:34:45.149]  Because I've been telling people, if you can't afford it, I'll send you a copy or send you a check to get it.
[02:34:45.149 --> 02:34:46.450]  You've actually been doing that.
[02:34:46.450 --> 02:34:48.351]  So don't do that here.
[02:34:48.351 --> 02:34:49.912]  You just want this to get out.
[02:34:49.912 --> 02:34:51.153]  You're not doing this for money.
[02:34:51.153 --> 02:34:52.593]  You're doing this for honor.
[02:34:52.593 --> 02:34:54.094]  So continue with your story.
[02:34:54.094 --> 02:34:55.115]  Continue breaking it down.
[02:34:55.663 --> 02:34:56.984]  Well, I do want to say this.
[02:34:56.984 --> 02:35:06.391]  I did send my publisher a request this morning to see if we could lower the price of the Kindle version of this book, at least between now and the election.
[02:35:06.391 --> 02:35:08.353]  There are limitations what you can do with Amazon.
[02:35:08.353 --> 02:35:08.673]  Oh, I know.
[02:35:08.673 --> 02:35:11.535]  We're selling our Hillary for President shirt at cost.
[02:35:11.535 --> 02:35:15.999]  I'm spending the backup money we have, because any operation like this has to have backup money.
[02:35:15.999 --> 02:35:16.179]  Yeah.
[02:35:16.179 --> 02:35:17.420]  But I know it's so serious.
[02:35:17.420 --> 02:35:19.742]  The last six months, I've hired more people, done more.
[02:35:22.330 --> 02:35:27.952]  Every bit of sail on we can to try to defeat the globalists because I can feel in my gut this is such a game changer.
[02:35:27.952 --> 02:35:29.373]  We're all in at this point.
[02:35:29.373 --> 02:35:30.253]  That's absolutely true.
[02:35:30.253 --> 02:35:32.774]  I do want to say one more thing about Amazon.
[02:35:32.774 --> 02:35:34.935]  My book went to number one on Kindle.
[02:35:34.935 --> 02:35:36.695]  I took a screenshot that day.
[02:35:36.695 --> 02:35:40.377]  I was so tickled because Hamilton had been number one and I was number two.
[02:35:40.377 --> 02:35:41.737]  Hamilton was so huge.
[02:35:41.737 --> 02:35:45.199]  And then one day, wow, I went to number one and the next day it was number one.
[02:35:45.199 --> 02:35:51.441]  And so I was looking for my number one sticker from Amazon because, you know, once you get number one, then you can always say I was the number one bestseller.
[02:35:51.881 --> 02:35:52.742]  Amazon, right?
[02:35:52.742 --> 02:35:53.763]  Forever.
[02:35:53.763 --> 02:35:57.947]  Except they wouldn't give me the number one sticker and I had my publisher call and say, what's the deal?
[02:35:57.947 --> 02:36:01.531]  And they said, well, there's more to getting a number one sticker than being number one.
[02:36:01.531 --> 02:36:05.134]  And my publisher said, so what else is there?
[02:36:05.134 --> 02:36:06.776]  Well, that's proprietary information.
[02:36:07.438 --> 02:36:09.660]  Which means we decide who gets that.
[02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:10.440]  Exactly.
[02:36:10.440 --> 02:36:12.902]  But what's coming up this election is how rigged everything is.
[02:36:12.902 --> 02:36:13.942]  Everyone should get the book.
[02:36:13.942 --> 02:36:17.785]  Hillary, the other woman available on Amazon, worldnetdaily.com.
[02:36:17.785 --> 02:36:19.426]  I'm not being paid to promote any of this.
[02:36:19.426 --> 02:36:24.049]  I'm doing this to get the word out because this is a very credible lady exposing all of this.
[02:36:24.049 --> 02:36:25.510]  Now let's walk into
[02:36:26.511 --> 02:36:30.074]  Where Bill Clinton goes from there, what's happening with these women and why we're speaking out.
[02:36:30.074 --> 02:36:35.778]  You mentioned Juanita Broderick we've had on years ago, and then I guess about six months ago.
[02:36:35.778 --> 02:36:37.079]  Here's the first clip.
[02:36:37.079 --> 02:36:41.482]  Juanita Broderick supports Bill Clinton rape protest.
[02:36:41.482 --> 02:36:43.683]  This is a national movement we launched.
[02:36:43.683 --> 02:36:48.867]  It's very successful because they want to send their people, funded by George Soros, to beat people up and start riots.
[02:36:48.867 --> 02:36:49.528]  We don't do that.
[02:36:49.528 --> 02:36:50.889]  We say legally, lawfully go.
[02:36:50.889 --> 02:36:52.570]  And you were telling me you're aware of this movement.
[02:36:53.030 --> 02:37:01.515]  Yes, I am, and someone sent a tweet about it the other day, and I said, hey, thank Alex Jones for that, because you started it.
[02:37:01.515 --> 02:37:06.098]  Well, I want to thank the listeners that are going out and doing it, but yes, our listeners are who we thank, and they're awesome folks.
[02:37:06.098 --> 02:37:07.519]  Yeah, apparently so.
[02:37:07.519 --> 02:37:09.260]  Well, it's happened two or three times a day.
[02:37:09.260 --> 02:37:13.062]  Obama, Hillary, Bill, and I'm told Hillary was even in the Associated Press.
[02:37:13.062 --> 02:37:13.743]  She's getting pissed.
[02:37:13.743 --> 02:37:15.904]  In fact, she's saying she may cancel events because of it.
[02:37:15.984 --> 02:37:19.308]  Well, of course, because she cannot face truth.
[02:37:19.308 --> 02:37:21.250]  This is one of the big things about Hillary.
[02:37:21.250 --> 02:37:22.971]  Let's talk about her psychology.
[02:37:22.971 --> 02:37:25.674]  I've had two Secret Service on, FBI on everybody.
[02:37:25.674 --> 02:37:33.723]  They say she won't give tips, little people she blows up at, don't look her in the eyes, and that she just blows up constantly.
[02:37:33.723 --> 02:37:34.564]  What's going on with her?
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:40.446]  I explained this in a couple of chapters in the book, so it's pretty hard to cover it all right now.
[02:37:40.446 --> 02:37:53.581]  But we all know, even from Hillary's own autobiography, what a sad childhood she had with a controlling, drill sergeant kind of father whom she never could please.
[02:37:53.581 --> 02:37:56.043]  I also think, and this is completely my opinion,
[02:37:56.784 --> 02:38:03.232]  Based on what I know about sex addiction, that I believe Hillary was sexually assaulted by a female.
[02:38:03.232 --> 02:38:12.042]  I also believe that she was sexually assaulted by a male, possibly someone in military uniform, which is why she hates the military.
[02:38:12.042 --> 02:38:12.703]  She hates men.
[02:38:12.703 --> 02:38:13.324]  She hates women.
[02:38:19.350 --> 02:38:20.871]  She hates Americans.
[02:38:20.871 --> 02:38:24.275]  She hates everyone, don't you see, because she hates herself.
[02:38:24.275 --> 02:38:28.879]  And you can look at a video of her, turn off the sound and look at the hate coming out of her eyes.
[02:38:28.879 --> 02:38:31.382]  I mean, it's hate.
[02:38:31.382 --> 02:38:34.985]  Well, that's what General Flynn said, former head of Army Intelligence, and I've been told by folks there's a
[02:38:35.546 --> 02:38:38.667]  Psychological dossier on her, and that's why the Russians have done their own breakdown.
[02:38:38.667 --> 02:38:39.987]  That's why everybody's so concerned.
[02:38:39.987 --> 02:38:45.429]  They say they believe she'll start major wars, that she hates everyone, and that she is extremely unstable.
[02:38:45.429 --> 02:38:46.689]  And General Flynn has said that.
[02:38:46.689 --> 02:38:48.170]  They believe she's unstable.
[02:38:48.170 --> 02:38:56.112]  Well, the other thing, too, about the Russians, it's very interesting that Hillary is now blaming these WikiLeaks on the Russians.
[02:38:56.112 --> 02:38:58.252]  And think about that, people.
[02:38:58.252 --> 02:38:59.753]  The Clinton Foundation, Hillary,
[02:39:00.433 --> 02:39:03.035]  Took tens of millions of dollars from the Russians.
[02:39:03.035 --> 02:39:03.755]  35 million, yeah.
[02:39:03.755 --> 02:39:05.296]  Yeah.
[02:39:05.296 --> 02:39:10.520]  And turned over 20% of our uranium supplies to the Russians.
[02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:19.306]  And what Hillary does with the Russians and with everything else, pay attention to this very carefully, everything that she does that she says someone else does, like Trump.
[02:39:20.066 --> 02:39:21.868]  It's all projection 101.
[02:39:21.868 --> 02:39:24.910]  If she says Trump is racist, it's because she's racist.
[02:39:24.910 --> 02:39:29.995]  If he says he's controlled by the Russians, it's because she's controlled by the Russians.
[02:39:29.995 --> 02:39:35.920]  And it was very simple for the Russians, for anyone else, to find out who was behind the WikiLeaks.
[02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:42.386]  And if anyone thinks that Seth Rich was killed randomly in a robbery on the- She got in the bag.
[02:39:42.526 --> 02:39:45.567]  This was a hit and they intended for people to know it was a hit.
[02:40:10.526 --> 02:40:14.530]  Because this is one of the ways they intimidate other people.
[02:40:14.530 --> 02:40:15.931]  It's like... Well, it's like Scalia.
[02:40:15.931 --> 02:40:20.295]  They announced the pillows on his head, that there will be no autopsy, the first announcement.
[02:40:20.295 --> 02:40:21.616]  Then they put the news.
[02:40:21.616 --> 02:40:24.239]  He was in a secret society there just to demonize him.
[02:40:24.239 --> 02:40:26.401]  It was a hunting society.
[02:40:26.401 --> 02:40:32.727]  And now we have Podesta, the chief of staff for Hillary, talking about wet work two days before he died saying, get ready.
[02:40:33.027 --> 02:40:36.870]  Well, and look what happened when Vince Foster died.
[02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:38.051]  That was more wet work.
[02:40:38.051 --> 02:40:43.175]  Died, and Billy supposedly found out about it on Larry King Live.
[02:40:43.175 --> 02:40:52.983]  And the first thing he said, now here's his friend of his since, friends since childhood, maybe since the playpen, I think their mothers were friends when they were pregnant, from Hope, Arkansas.
[02:40:52.983 --> 02:41:01.650]  And the first thing Billy says when he finds out his longtime friend is dead, he says, well, we'll never know what really happened.
[02:41:02.605 --> 02:41:03.686]  Really?
[02:41:03.686 --> 02:41:05.287]  We'll never know?
[02:41:05.287 --> 02:41:06.148]  That's his first reaction?
[02:41:06.148 --> 02:41:09.070]  And he's shot in the head with no blood at the scene, obviously taken there.
[02:41:09.070 --> 02:41:10.431]  Yeah, and that's his reaction?
[02:41:10.431 --> 02:41:14.954]  What would your reaction be if one of your longtime friends was committed suicide?
[02:41:14.954 --> 02:41:17.637]  I'd get dizzy, I'd sit there and be, I'd say, really?
[02:41:17.637 --> 02:41:18.897]  I'd start crying.
[02:41:18.897 --> 02:41:20.579]  Yeah, well, you're human.
[02:41:21.991 --> 02:41:23.993]  But you were saying earlier on, Bill seemed more human.
[02:41:23.993 --> 02:41:26.656]  He seems to... Am I wrong to say Hillary's the boss, though?
[02:41:26.656 --> 02:41:30.060]  From all my research over the years, all the witnesses, it seems to me she's the boss.
[02:41:30.060 --> 02:41:31.622]  She found this flawed guy.
[02:41:31.622 --> 02:41:33.144]  She made him worse.
[02:41:33.144 --> 02:41:34.946]  She wasn't a beard for homosexuality.
[02:41:34.946 --> 02:41:38.210]  She was a beard for his drug abuse and sex behavior.
[02:41:38.863 --> 02:41:40.984]  It's hard to say that she really controls him.
[02:41:40.984 --> 02:41:45.945]  I talk about in the book, the attraction was that she is his mean, controlling grandmother.
[02:41:45.945 --> 02:41:49.546]  Remember, he was not raised by his mother for the first four or five years of his life.
[02:41:49.546 --> 02:41:53.607]  Now, why does she get all glassy-eyed and keep calling Trump my husband?
[02:41:53.607 --> 02:41:55.348]  And then she only went off script to talk about me.
[02:41:55.348 --> 02:41:57.149]  And I'm not getting on a power trip because I don't want her attracting me.
[02:41:57.149 --> 02:42:00.089]  But when she talks about me, she goes, how does he have such a dark heart?
[02:42:00.089 --> 02:42:02.090]  She just gets like, ah.
[02:42:02.090 --> 02:42:04.311]  No, I mean, now when she attacks me, she kind of acts all weird.
[02:42:04.311 --> 02:42:07.031]  Like, somebody gave a speech, she talks about me, she gets real weird.
[02:42:07.031 --> 02:42:07.792]  What the hell's going on?
[02:42:07.792 --> 02:42:08.452]  It's really creepy.
[02:42:09.438 --> 02:42:12.800]  It is creepy, and that's unfortunately not the creepiest thing about her.
[02:42:12.800 --> 02:42:15.242]  So what do you think of psychologists?
[02:42:15.242 --> 02:42:16.682]  You're a lawyer.
[02:42:16.682 --> 02:42:18.904]  And you know I was a psych major before I was a lawyer.
[02:42:18.904 --> 02:42:19.344]  I knew that.
[02:42:19.344 --> 02:42:19.764]  You're a smart lady.
[02:42:19.764 --> 02:42:20.825]  So what do you think is going on with her?
[02:42:20.825 --> 02:42:25.048]  When she talks about Trump, she seems to get excited.
[02:42:25.048 --> 02:42:27.729]  She seems a little bit attracted to Trump.
[02:42:27.729 --> 02:42:28.750]  I pick up the body language.
[02:42:28.750 --> 02:42:29.250]  I'm sorry.
[02:42:29.250 --> 02:42:31.211]  Well, here's the thing about Trump.
[02:42:31.211 --> 02:42:32.012]  He's a real man.
[02:42:33.137 --> 02:42:34.578]  He is a real man.
[02:42:34.578 --> 02:42:41.421]  And I think that's what's attracting a lot of people, just like men were attracted to John Wayne in a way.
[02:42:41.421 --> 02:42:46.643]  I mean, you know that he swaggers in and he takes control and he solves the problems.
[02:42:46.643 --> 02:42:49.565]  And I think that's what we all recognize that Donald Trump
[02:42:50.245 --> 02:42:51.205]  Can do.
[02:42:51.205 --> 02:42:52.426]  We don't know how he's going to do it.
[02:42:52.426 --> 02:42:53.166]  And guess what?
[02:42:53.166 --> 02:42:54.627]  He probably doesn't know how either.
[02:42:54.627 --> 02:42:58.028]  But this is a successful businessman who knows how to delegate.
[02:42:58.028 --> 02:43:00.729]  Well, he's just not out to get us, if he's just not out to get us.
[02:43:00.729 --> 02:43:02.870]  And look who he chose for vice president.
[02:43:02.870 --> 02:43:05.631]  Look how he turned Mexican president with one meeting for him.
[02:43:05.631 --> 02:43:10.332]  Because I know it was said, Little Bird told me, he said, listen, you've been screwed over by globalism.
[02:43:10.332 --> 02:43:11.053]  Let's come together.
[02:43:11.053 --> 02:43:12.333]  Let's make both our countries rich.
[02:43:12.333 --> 02:43:15.934]  Let's break this multinational collateral system that wants us poor.
[02:43:15.934 --> 02:43:17.575]  He came out and the Mexican president was glowing.
[02:43:18.115 --> 02:43:20.277]  I mean, that's all we need to do is have prosperity.
[02:43:20.277 --> 02:43:22.999]  Yes, and the other thing is, look at his first big decision.
[02:43:22.999 --> 02:43:25.662]  Mike Pence, for Pete's sake, what a fabulous guy.
[02:43:25.662 --> 02:43:26.863]  We were going to talk about that.
[02:43:26.863 --> 02:43:30.906]  Look how, Chrissy's about to get indicted.
[02:43:30.906 --> 02:43:34.690]  We've got former Speaker Gingrich coming out against Trump.
[02:43:34.690 --> 02:43:36.872]  Look how Pence has been really a stalwart.
[02:43:37.812 --> 02:43:39.072]  He did pick the right guy.
[02:43:39.072 --> 02:43:40.633]  He picked an absolutely fabulous guy.
[02:43:40.633 --> 02:43:41.133]  Because he's loyal.
[02:43:41.133 --> 02:43:41.953]  He's loyal.
[02:43:41.953 --> 02:43:47.575]  Well, and he's bright, he's articulate, he's knowledgeable, he is principled.
[02:43:47.575 --> 02:43:54.137]  I met him and his wife in Florida last month and I was very impressed with them, with both of them.
[02:43:54.137 --> 02:43:59.458]  I just think that this shows right up front Trump's ability to pick the right people.
[02:43:59.458 --> 02:44:02.279]  I'm not groveling because I've never heard an answer like this, but I mean is Trump not a godsend?
[02:44:03.126 --> 02:44:10.513]  I think so, and you know, I said, I think it was in my Sunday school, I said, you know, for years, a lot of us Christians have been praying for our country.
[02:44:10.513 --> 02:44:11.875]  Praying, praying, praying.
[02:44:11.875 --> 02:44:17.540]  And I believe God has a sense of humor, and it may be that Donald Trump is the answer to prayer.
[02:44:17.540 --> 02:44:20.063]  He is not the person that any of us would think.
[02:44:20.063 --> 02:44:21.484]  But look at the Bible, it never was like that.
[02:44:21.484 --> 02:44:23.286]  No, it never was, that's exactly it.
[02:44:23.286 --> 02:44:26.630]  God always chooses interesting people.
[02:44:27.731 --> 02:44:29.333]  And that's what we have here.
[02:44:29.333 --> 02:44:34.639]  We don't have the person who would be the stereotypical hero to come in and go to Washington.
[02:44:34.639 --> 02:44:37.622]  But what we have in Washington is a cesspool.
[02:44:37.622 --> 02:44:40.105]  And don't get me started on that.
[02:44:40.105 --> 02:44:42.528]  Republicans try to get more into Bill Clinton, more into your book.
[02:44:42.528 --> 02:44:43.589]  But I want to get into this.
[02:44:43.589 --> 02:44:44.410]  OK.
[02:44:44.410 --> 02:44:44.650]  I mean.
[02:44:45.511 --> 02:44:46.192]  It's in the emails.
[02:44:46.192 --> 02:44:47.873]  They're out to get the average American.
[02:44:47.873 --> 02:44:49.313]  They hate their black supporters.
[02:44:49.313 --> 02:44:51.315]  They hate poor white supporters.
[02:44:51.315 --> 02:44:55.397]  It's like, they want to make you dependent, then they disdain you when they make you dependent.
[02:44:55.397 --> 02:44:57.038]  The nastiness of these emails.
[02:44:57.038 --> 02:44:57.979]  There's so many thousands.
[02:44:57.979 --> 02:45:00.220]  I can't even keep track how we're going to keep them dumb.
[02:45:00.220 --> 02:45:01.321]  We're going to keep them poor.
[02:45:01.321 --> 02:45:05.903]  We knew all this, but reading this, it's like, how the hell do you write this and send it to somebody?
[02:45:05.903 --> 02:45:08.085]  Like, I want to keep my employees poor.
[02:45:08.085 --> 02:45:09.766]  I want poor people.
[02:45:09.766 --> 02:45:12.167]  And I want them to, meanwhile, you're like, I'm liberal.
[02:45:12.167 --> 02:45:13.708]  Oh, you know, it's just what the hell?
[02:45:13.868 --> 02:45:19.072]  Well, I have a chapter in here, in the book, called The Plantation Mentality.
[02:45:19.072 --> 02:45:22.494]  And that's why I say, everything that's happening is in this book.
[02:45:22.494 --> 02:45:24.735]  It's foreshadowed, it's foretold, it's explained.
[02:45:24.735 --> 02:45:28.318]  It really is some weird Byzantine sharecropper.
[02:45:28.318 --> 02:45:32.961]  It's all in here because nothing has changed in 45 years.
[02:45:32.961 --> 02:45:37.104]  And here's the thing, you talk about something that's racist, how about open borders?
[02:45:37.104 --> 02:45:40.506]  How about letting all these people come in here who will work for $4 an hour
[02:45:41.787 --> 02:45:42.608]  What is that doing?
[02:45:42.608 --> 02:45:44.409]  Oh, they're a permanent underclass.
[02:45:44.409 --> 02:45:44.889]  Exactly.
[02:45:44.889 --> 02:45:47.871]  They're the new underclass to be the bottom and then to bring us down.
[02:45:47.871 --> 02:45:48.331]  That's right.
[02:45:48.331 --> 02:45:50.033]  Whereas I want to bring everybody up.
[02:45:50.033 --> 02:45:58.258]  And African-Americans and women and Hispanics who are here legally are the ones who are going to be the most hurt by this open borders thing, not to mention the rest of us.
[02:45:58.258 --> 02:45:59.619]  And then it doesn't bring the other countries up.
[02:45:59.619 --> 02:46:00.780]  All the studies are done.
[02:46:00.780 --> 02:46:01.180]  No!
[02:46:01.180 --> 02:46:03.602]  Well, they admit the plan is to drop down wages, break us.
[02:46:04.355 --> 02:46:07.236]  And why did Mexico build a wall on its southern border?
[02:46:07.236 --> 02:46:07.636]  Oh, I know.
[02:46:07.636 --> 02:46:09.396]  Once you're informed, it's all hypocrisy.
[02:46:09.396 --> 02:46:12.277]  So, looking at this then, what does your gut tell you about the election?
[02:46:12.277 --> 02:46:13.817]  Because we have the internal polls.
[02:46:13.817 --> 02:46:15.998]  I told people, like, three months ago, and they said he was starting to lose.
[02:46:15.998 --> 02:46:16.878]  He was ten points ahead.
[02:46:16.878 --> 02:46:19.098]  Suddenly, he's five points behind us, and it's all bull.
[02:46:19.098 --> 02:46:20.139]  Then it keeps coming out.
[02:46:20.139 --> 02:46:21.399]  None of this is working.
[02:46:21.399 --> 02:46:22.279]  He's way ahead.
[02:46:22.279 --> 02:46:23.420]  Hillary's panicking.
[02:46:23.420 --> 02:46:24.780]  Her internal emails show this.
[02:46:26.101 --> 02:46:29.164]  Suddenly Homeland Security comes in to save the election from the Russians.
[02:46:29.164 --> 02:46:30.525]  This is unprecedented!
[02:46:30.525 --> 02:46:34.829]  If they try a coup in front of us, of a landslide, what does Trump do?
[02:46:34.829 --> 02:46:36.811]  They're so mad, he says he's going to fight.
[02:46:36.811 --> 02:46:37.852]  I hope he does.
[02:46:37.852 --> 02:46:40.335]  And what I say is this, Alex.
[02:46:40.335 --> 02:46:44.339]  Hillary can not win this election.
[02:46:44.339 --> 02:46:49.123]  Now, she may be able to steal it, but she can not win it.
[02:46:49.949 --> 02:46:52.210]  Well, I mean, she has 200 people at her events.
[02:46:52.210 --> 02:46:52.991]  She has 30,000.
[02:46:52.991 --> 02:46:53.451]  Exactly.
[02:46:53.451 --> 02:46:54.912]  I've been to some Trump events.
[02:46:54.912 --> 02:46:56.112]  Oh my gosh.
[02:46:56.112 --> 02:46:57.213]  And they're not just there.
[02:46:57.213 --> 02:46:58.554]  The people are not just there.
[02:46:58.554 --> 02:47:01.055]  It's like an Arkansas Razorback football game.
[02:47:01.055 --> 02:47:03.636]  They're all around.
[02:47:03.636 --> 02:47:04.797]  It's like a big campout.
[02:47:04.797 --> 02:47:05.357]  Absolutely.
[02:47:05.357 --> 02:47:06.458]  They're all excited.
[02:47:06.458 --> 02:47:09.920]  And by the way, it's people of every race, color, and creed, which makes the media so mad.
[02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:10.840]  Absolutely.
[02:47:10.840 --> 02:47:11.721]  Absolutely.
[02:47:11.721 --> 02:47:13.322]  And the media coverage
[02:47:14.202 --> 02:47:20.527]  Stinks, and there's a chapter in here, chapter 47, media magic, or how to make a story disappear.
[02:47:20.527 --> 02:47:31.134]  And I'll bet you that most people who are watching have no idea that I filed a RICO lawsuit against Billy Clinton and his cohorts back in, what, 1998?
[02:47:31.134 --> 02:47:33.616]  A federal RICO lawsuit.
[02:47:33.616 --> 02:47:34.576]  No one knows that.
[02:47:34.576 --> 02:47:35.617]  You know why?
[02:47:35.617 --> 02:47:37.799]  Media magic, how to make a story disappear.
[02:47:37.799 --> 02:47:40.381]  And Billy filed a motion in federal district court
[02:47:41.081 --> 02:47:47.750]  Saying that he should not have to answer this case because he was a sitting president and the district court said, sorry Bubba.
[02:47:48.749 --> 02:47:49.809]  You got to answer.
[02:47:49.809 --> 02:47:53.111]  And he took it to the Federal Appeals Court, and they said the same thing.
[02:47:53.111 --> 02:47:54.651]  We don't care if you're the sitting president.
[02:47:54.651 --> 02:47:55.852]  This is a federal lawsuit.
[02:47:55.852 --> 02:47:56.552]  You need to answer.
[02:47:56.552 --> 02:47:59.433]  And he took it all the way to the United States Supreme Court.
[02:47:59.433 --> 02:48:00.113]  And what do you think?
[02:48:00.113 --> 02:48:02.995]  The Supremes ruled unanimously in my favor.
[02:48:02.995 --> 02:48:14.099]  And then Lisa Meyer of NBC, who did that fabulous, intense interview with Juanita Broderick about the rape, called me and wanted to interview me on the steps of the federal courthouse in Washington.
[02:48:15.020 --> 02:48:16.582]  Okay, great.
[02:48:16.582 --> 02:48:20.848]  Lisa called me the night before and she said, Dolly, I'm sorry, we have to cancel the interview in the morning.
[02:48:20.848 --> 02:48:22.190]  That's how the executives kill it.
[02:48:22.190 --> 02:48:25.494]  They have a blockade on Danny Williams, his illegitimate son, reportedly.
[02:48:25.494 --> 02:48:27.497]  They have a media blockade and all this other stuff.
[02:48:27.497 --> 02:48:28.879]  Look at drugreport.com right now.
[02:48:29.940 --> 02:48:31.801]  I don't know how many of you are radio listeners can go there.
[02:48:31.801 --> 02:48:32.601]  FirstReport.com.
[02:48:32.601 --> 02:48:35.082]  Obama claimed executive privilege of Hillary Mesh.
[02:48:35.082 --> 02:48:36.283]  Now we know.
[02:48:36.283 --> 02:48:37.563]  It's come out in the emails.
[02:48:37.563 --> 02:48:41.485]  They never told us he declared it, but now it's confirmed the White House declared it.
[02:48:41.485 --> 02:48:44.567]  He had a nom de plume, a fake name.
[02:48:44.567 --> 02:48:52.650]  That's what the head of the EPA had to step down for, communicating with Hillary, working on all these deals outside of the Freedom of Information Act.
[02:48:52.650 --> 02:48:55.732]  So, they're running clandestine operations against this country.
[02:48:57.037 --> 02:49:00.999]  Shock poll, no sign of allegation fallout yet.
[02:49:00.999 --> 02:49:03.140]  There's a whole bunch of polls.
[02:49:03.140 --> 02:49:04.541]  This is Rasmussen though.
[02:49:04.541 --> 02:49:06.041]  It's not hurting Trump.
[02:49:06.041 --> 02:49:07.082]  He's really way ahead.
[02:49:08.314 --> 02:49:14.337]  So what does your gut tell you, Dolly Kyle, author of Hillary the Other Woman, what are they going to pull?
[02:49:14.337 --> 02:49:19.119]  As a smart lady that knows these people, as a constitutional lawyer, been around a while, what's your gut tell you?
[02:49:19.119 --> 02:49:22.580]  Because I feel like 24 days out, we are just hurtling towards disaster.
[02:49:22.580 --> 02:49:32.045]  I mean, these arrogant, crazy, disconnected people, Hillary can hardly go downstairs, she has seizures, she's all whacked out, he's got handlers sending emails about wet work, you know, Scalia.
[02:49:32.965 --> 02:49:35.167]  I mean, we've entered the twilight zone.
[02:49:35.167 --> 02:49:37.168]  Don't they get, we're not backing down.
[02:49:37.168 --> 02:49:38.509]  They just don't know.
[02:49:38.509 --> 02:49:44.034]  They're like a 100 ton freight train going up against a 500 ton freight train.
[02:49:44.034 --> 02:49:56.963]  Well, Alex, the whole thing is mind boggling because if you believe about the voting machines and the way they can be tampered and if you believe that the ballots were, you know, already marked for Hillary in a lot of places.
[02:49:56.963 --> 02:49:58.144]  That's already happening in Florida and New York.
[02:49:58.144 --> 02:49:58.805]  No, it's confirmed.
[02:49:59.085 --> 02:50:03.707]  Okay, and look what happened to the ballots for Bernie in California, 35,000 seats.
[02:50:03.707 --> 02:50:06.148]  He clearly won Stanford University.
[02:50:06.148 --> 02:50:07.589]  Absolutely, he would have won.
[02:50:07.589 --> 02:50:15.092]  So, I don't know, and I remember, and I talked about this in the book, because this was in Hot Springs in Arkansas when I was a kid, big time.
[02:50:15.092 --> 02:50:18.093]  I mean, they sold the ballot boxes at the end of the evening.
[02:50:18.093 --> 02:50:21.055]  My mother was a, what do you call it, poll watcher.
[02:50:21.855 --> 02:50:25.460]  And they asked her if she'd like to stay for the barbecue and the auction.
[02:50:25.460 --> 02:50:26.321]  She said, what auction?
[02:50:26.321 --> 02:50:31.408]  She said, at nine o'clock we auction off the ballot boxes one precinct at a time.
[02:50:31.408 --> 02:50:31.688]  Hello.
[02:50:33.553 --> 02:50:38.758]  And Al Capone used to sit right there at the, what's that big famous hotel?
[02:50:38.758 --> 02:50:40.219]  He was at the Arlington.
[02:50:40.219 --> 02:50:41.520]  The Arlington 4th floor.
[02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:42.561]  Well, 4th or 6th.
[02:50:42.561 --> 02:50:44.884]  Right there in the corner.
[02:50:44.884 --> 02:50:45.965]  I've stayed in that room, yeah.
[02:50:45.965 --> 02:50:48.086]  And they would just auction everything off right there.
[02:50:48.086 --> 02:50:50.248]  Well, Al Capone actually wasn't there.
[02:50:50.248 --> 02:50:50.929]  That was earlier.
[02:50:50.929 --> 02:50:52.310]  That was way earlier.
[02:50:52.310 --> 02:50:53.251]  The tradition started.
[02:50:53.251 --> 02:50:54.232]  Yeah, and you know what?
[02:50:54.232 --> 02:50:56.734]  Some of my favorite chapters in here are about Hot Springs.
[02:50:56.734 --> 02:50:57.835]  People love those.
[02:50:57.835 --> 02:50:58.136]  It's good.

[02:54:30.294 --> 02:54:34.738]  I just love the ladies, you know, that are patriots in this country standing up to evil.

[02:54:46.185 --> 02:54:50.188]  Here's when Ida Broderick supports Bill Clinton's rapist protest movement.
[02:54:50.188 --> 02:54:51.468]  This is Breitbart News.
[02:54:51.468 --> 02:54:52.909]  Here it is.
[02:54:52.909 --> 02:54:58.253]  Nobody can dispute the fact that we need... Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[02:55:05.700 --> 02:55:14.909]  Well, I hope that no one gets hurt during this, but I hope it encourages people to say, why are they saying this?
[02:55:14.909 --> 02:55:17.532]  What does Bill Clinton have to do with rape?
[02:55:17.532 --> 02:55:19.774]  And then hopefully they'll research and find out.
[02:55:21.152 --> 02:55:23.073]  Well, I hadn't seen all of that.
[02:55:23.073 --> 02:55:25.554]  I just saw the one little clip at the beginning.
[02:55:25.554 --> 02:55:26.434]  There's like 25 of them now.
[02:55:26.434 --> 02:55:27.294]  We can't even keep track of them.
[02:55:27.294 --> 02:55:28.615]  I mean, the crowd went crazy.
[02:55:28.615 --> 02:55:29.475]  That's awesome.
[02:55:29.475 --> 02:55:30.215]  Yeah, they did, didn't they?
[02:55:30.215 --> 02:55:31.396]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:55:31.396 --> 02:55:32.716]  It's not going too well, is it?
[02:55:32.716 --> 02:55:33.717]  And folks stand up.
[02:55:33.717 --> 02:55:37.538]  Well, you know, I say it's either whatever way you want to look at it.
[02:55:37.538 --> 02:55:42.180]  Karma, or reaping what you've sown, or the chickens coming home to roost.
[02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:43.941]  It's time.
[02:55:43.941 --> 02:55:44.721]  It's time.
[02:55:44.721 --> 02:55:46.803]  Here's another one with Mrs. Broderick.
[02:55:46.803 --> 02:55:51.467]  Hillary tried to silence me on Bill Clinton's right, but now they're saying they fear for their lives.
[02:55:51.467 --> 02:55:55.831]  We got Podesta talking about wet work in emails now before Scalia dies.
[02:55:55.831 --> 02:55:57.773]  Okay, so here it is.
[02:55:57.773 --> 02:55:59.495]  You saw Bill Clinton weeks later.
[02:56:01.789 --> 02:56:03.210]  Yes.
[02:56:03.210 --> 02:56:15.479]  That was still in this period of shock and wondering what had happened and how I could have been so stupid to have allowed something like that to happen.
[02:56:15.479 --> 02:56:16.580]  Still blaming yourself?
[02:56:16.580 --> 02:56:18.241]  Still blaming myself.
[02:56:18.241 --> 02:56:20.063]  Just still blaming myself.
[02:56:20.803 --> 02:56:34.097]  And I realized that I have information that needs to go back to the campaign because I had not returned to the volunteering, you know, putting yard signs up, asking for donations and things like that.
[02:56:34.097 --> 02:56:38.461]  So I found about three to four checks to the Clinton campaign.
[02:56:38.461 --> 02:56:39.382]  They weren't but for $25 or $50.
[02:56:39.382 --> 02:56:40.283]  They were small checks.
[02:56:42.585 --> 02:56:46.666]  And then some list of people who were still going to donate.
[02:56:46.666 --> 02:56:52.588]  So I asked Norma, that was the lady that was with me at the time, if she would run up to that event with me.
[02:56:52.588 --> 02:56:55.088]  And I think she's the one that went with me.
[02:56:55.088 --> 02:57:01.190]  And we went up there before, long before the fundraiser was to happen.
[02:57:01.190 --> 02:57:06.111]  This was a fundraiser at the home of a local dentist, correct?
[02:57:06.111 --> 02:57:06.331]  Yes.
[02:57:06.331 --> 02:57:08.552]  For Bill Clinton, running for governor.
[02:57:08.812 --> 02:57:09.092]  Right.
[02:57:09.092 --> 02:57:12.975]  Did you know that he was going to come and that he was going to show up with Hillary?
[02:57:12.975 --> 02:57:22.942]  Oh, I'm sure that I knew that, but that's why we went 30 minutes early, so I could give the lady from Little Rock the checks and the list, and then we were going to get out of there.
[02:57:22.942 --> 02:57:26.304]  And they come in early from the kitchen area.
[02:57:26.304 --> 02:57:29.767]  And just before they do... They would be Bill and Hillary?
[02:57:29.767 --> 02:57:31.208]  Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[02:57:31.208 --> 02:57:36.672]  And just before they do, a gentleman who had driven them from the airport comes straight over to me.
[02:57:36.672 --> 02:57:37.813]  He was a very...
[02:57:38.793 --> 02:57:44.437]  He was supporting Clinton, but he didn't know what had happened to me, even though he was a friend.
[02:57:44.437 --> 02:57:52.522]  And he said, the topic of the conversation all the way from the airport was about you, and that startled me.
[02:57:52.522 --> 02:57:54.323]  And I knew I had to get out of there.
[02:57:54.323 --> 02:57:58.086]  Well, just as he moved, here comes Hillary straight for me.
[02:57:59.406 --> 02:58:07.949]  And starts, gets to me and she starts saying, I just want to thank you for everything you're doing in Bill's campaign.
[02:58:07.949 --> 02:58:10.750]  And it's so nice to meet you and all of these things.
[02:58:10.750 --> 02:58:13.810]  So I just nodded and told my friend, let's go.
[02:58:13.810 --> 02:58:18.672]  And I thought somebody from behind had grabbed a hold of my arm, but it was her.
[02:58:19.532 --> 02:58:37.598]  She grabbed a hold of my arm and my hand, and she pulls me into her, and she says with this very angry look on her face, which had been so pleasant seconds before, and in a low voice, says, do you understand everything you do?
[02:58:37.598 --> 02:58:46.541]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:49.795 --> 02:58:56.340]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:58:56.340 --> 02:58:59.542]  Dr. Grip, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:58:59.542 --> 02:59:05.147]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:59:05.147 --> 02:59:11.271]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:59:11.271 --> 02:59:14.554]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:59:14.554 --> 02:59:15.995]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[02:59:16.195 --> 02:59:20.517]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:59:20.517 --> 02:59:23.458]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:59:23.458 --> 02:59:25.119]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:59:25.119 --> 02:59:28.560]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:59:28.560 --> 02:59:31.161]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:59:31.161 --> 02:59:32.222]  It's in powder form.
[02:59:32.222 --> 02:59:35.103]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[02:59:35.103 --> 02:59:35.803]  I take this.
[02:59:35.803 --> 02:59:37.624]  This is the product that I take.
[02:59:37.624 --> 02:59:39.605]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[02:59:40.405 --> 02:59:41.205]  We fight the Globals!
[02:59:41.205 --> 02:59:42.346]  We fight the New World Order!

[03:00:14.008 --> 03:00:16.510]  The world is a dangerous place.
[03:00:16.510 --> 03:00:22.273]  Not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:00:22.273 --> 03:00:24.194]  You are the resistance.
[03:00:24.194 --> 03:00:27.997]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:00:27.997 --> 03:00:31.539]  In the hearts of Alex Jones.
[03:00:31.539 --> 03:00:34.661]  Talk radio was the original internet because you could call in to it.
[03:00:34.661 --> 03:00:36.142]  It was uncensored to a great extent.
[03:00:36.142 --> 03:00:37.443]  It was long form.
[03:00:37.443 --> 03:00:39.364]  It was hard to have teleprompter heads in there.
[03:00:40.895 --> 03:00:47.639]  And it started getting really popular by the 70s, so they passed laws to not let there be political views, which of course it was all just liberal garbage.
[03:00:47.639 --> 03:00:55.524]  Then by the late 80s, they got rid of the Fairness Doctrine, and you saw the Return of Talk Radio fusing with the Internet right as it was being popularized.
[03:00:55.524 --> 03:00:56.644]  It was born, obviously, in the 60s.
[03:00:58.092 --> 03:01:06.237]  And so this format of talk radio slash film slash live feeds fusing with the internet is the future.
[03:01:06.237 --> 03:01:10.639]  And we've been doing it for... I've been doing this style show for at least 15, 16 years.
[03:01:10.639 --> 03:01:11.240]  We were the first.
[03:01:11.240 --> 03:01:11.820]  I'm not bragging.
[03:01:11.820 --> 03:01:14.482]  We did it through necessity just to reach people.
[03:01:14.482 --> 03:01:16.583]  I was a radio host who wanted to do internet TV.
[03:01:16.583 --> 03:01:16.983]  We've done it.
[03:01:20.120 --> 03:01:21.161]  I'm very honored to be here.
[03:01:21.161 --> 03:01:22.201]  History's happening.
[03:01:22.201 --> 03:01:27.864]  And very few people actually get what's happening in the media, that it's not about your ABC, your NBC, your Fox.
[03:01:27.864 --> 03:01:37.749]  It's about you put out your analysis, you link to other people, you pick up this feed, you pick up that feed, you dip into lots of different things and get different perspectives and get outside the bubble.
[03:01:37.749 --> 03:01:39.230]  Google wants to make it all about
[03:01:40.404 --> 03:01:46.206]  They keep you in your little plantation, your little niche, and they feed you what you think you want, and then control you.
[03:01:46.206 --> 03:01:48.246]  They've got all these algorithms out saying they're giving it.
[03:01:48.246 --> 03:01:54.228]  It's come out in the WikiLeaks to Obama, and they're targeting the undecided, you know, 10 million voters to turn them for Hillary.
[03:01:54.228 --> 03:01:59.469]  Well, those are the undecided that don't just accept the Google results.
[03:01:59.469 --> 03:02:01.870]  They're hoping you just accept whatever you're given instead of
[03:02:03.211 --> 03:02:20.296]  Looking at Google, looking at Yahoo, looking at AP, looking at Drudge, looking at WorldNetDaily, looking at InfoWars, looking at your email feed, looking at what people are sending you on Facebook, looking at what's on Twitter, reading what's in the local paper, shoot a video off local PBS of something happening and then talk about it yourself.
[03:02:20.296 --> 03:02:24.517]  That's how you add new content that the globalists don't centralize.
[03:02:24.517 --> 03:02:31.599]  They just put out their big centralized reports and then they just hope that we debate that little area instead of
[03:02:33.359 --> 03:02:34.279]  I never did this on purpose.
[03:02:34.279 --> 03:02:41.941]  I would take some police state story or some corruption story and I would talk about it on radio and make it national.
[03:02:41.941 --> 03:02:48.723]  Back when even most talk show hosts would just cover national stuff, very rarely would they cover something somewhere that happened.
[03:02:48.723 --> 03:02:51.164]  Early on I was like, why don't people do this?
[03:02:51.164 --> 03:02:52.604]  But I noticed Drudge was doing it.
[03:02:54.209 --> 03:02:59.778]  Drudge was starting, you know, well, dominating by the time I got on air in like 95, 96.
[03:02:59.778 --> 03:03:02.443]  And I just remember like, oh yeah, there's local stories and things.
[03:03:02.443 --> 03:03:03.465]  This is interesting.
[03:03:03.465 --> 03:03:07.992]  So it's kind of a breaking up the monopoly of who sets the table and who sets the menu.
[03:03:09.249 --> 03:03:10.349]  And I absolutely love it.
[03:03:10.349 --> 03:03:14.731]  I mean, I'm looking at the press conference here with this crying, you know, member of his family up here praying with Danny Williams.
[03:03:14.731 --> 03:03:15.971]  This guy's totally real.
[03:03:15.971 --> 03:03:17.031]  That was such veritas.
[03:03:17.031 --> 03:03:17.891]  It was so powerful.
[03:03:17.891 --> 03:03:19.112]  I feel so good being part of that.
[03:03:19.112 --> 03:03:24.293]  And we're putting in a live Trump feed, and we're getting ready to have guests on, and it's just amazing.
[03:03:24.293 --> 03:03:27.174]  Now, remember, listeners, this is the big Fusion broadcast.
[03:03:27.174 --> 03:03:30.375]  If you want to see this stuff by itself, it's on InfoWars.com.
[03:03:30.375 --> 03:03:31.195]  It's on DrudgeReport.com.
[03:03:31.195 --> 03:03:33.856]  Because I can't tell you how many people tune in and want to hear the press conference.
[03:03:33.856 --> 03:03:35.356]  I'm like, no, this is the show.
[03:03:35.356 --> 03:03:35.936]  This is radio.
[03:03:35.936 --> 03:03:36.496]  We have breaks.
[03:03:36.496 --> 03:03:37.057]  It's a format.
[03:03:37.057 --> 03:03:37.597]  I've got to follow it.
[03:03:38.936 --> 03:03:42.517]  We've got the totally free internet for you right now.
[03:03:42.517 --> 03:03:43.457]  So it's like channels.
[03:03:43.457 --> 03:03:45.037]  We're like a network.
[03:03:45.037 --> 03:03:51.699]  So the press conference just broke up and so we've got a lot unfolding there.
[03:03:51.699 --> 03:04:00.981]  If David wants to go get with Danny in 10-15 minutes and do a private interview as they've offered, we can pop in with that as well.
[03:04:00.981 --> 03:04:06.342]  We have Kathy Shelton joining us who is one of Hillary Clinton's victims.
[03:04:07.219 --> 03:04:10.461]  And I guess we've got the Hillary Famous clips and stuff ready of her laughing about it.
[03:04:10.461 --> 03:04:13.143]  But I'm going to let her and her lawyer come in here and get into all this.
[03:04:13.143 --> 03:04:18.066]  She's a little teenage girl, 12 years old, 13 years old.
[03:04:18.066 --> 03:04:23.010]  And I've forgotten more about the Clintons than most people know.
[03:04:23.010 --> 03:04:24.571]  I mean, seriously, I'm just so sick of them.
[03:04:24.571 --> 03:04:26.152]  I try to put it out of my mind sometimes.
[03:04:27.699 --> 03:04:33.047]  Hillary's a monster, and this just shows her whole history and what she's been involved in and what she does.
[03:04:33.047 --> 03:04:38.855]  It takes somebody really evil, even with our corrupt government and our corrupt agencies, and there are problems, obviously, to totally turn against her.
[03:04:38.855 --> 03:04:43.061]  The whole world's against her, because they understand she's uber bad.
[03:04:44.128 --> 03:04:46.712]  Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber bad.
[03:04:46.712 --> 03:04:56.126]  Now we're going to come back from break and play the Bev Harris crystallized, condensed interview on the biggest election fraud news ever and then have our guest in studio.
[03:04:56.126 --> 03:04:58.049]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[03:05:00.012 --> 03:05:07.718]  The Japanese coastline has been struck again and the Fukushima reactor cooling system, it stops flowing amid the quake and tsunami that followed.
[03:05:07.718 --> 03:05:11.661]  Damaged nuclear plant, it struggles after this latest natural disaster.
[03:05:11.661 --> 03:05:20.568]  Now the cooling system of the third reactor at the Fukushima nuclear plant has stopped circulating water following a powerful 7.3 offshore earthquake this week.
[03:05:20.848 --> 03:05:32.872]  HEPCO said that it managed to restart the system some 90 minutes after its failure and the cooling system servicing the Unit 3 spent fuel pool was not able to circulate water to cool nuclear fuel because of a broken pump.
[03:05:32.872 --> 03:05:35.693]  All of this is according to the Nuclear Regulatory Agency.
[03:05:35.693 --> 03:05:36.473]  It turns out
[03:05:36.493 --> 03:05:40.977]  Please check out our reports for more information regarding this latest quake and how it impacts the days coming forward.
[03:05:40.977 --> 03:05:42.598]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[03:05:59.611 --> 03:06:06.118]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[03:06:06.118 --> 03:06:18.911]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[03:06:19.091 --> 03:06:22.752]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[03:06:22.752 --> 03:06:29.734]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[03:06:29.734 --> 03:06:42.597]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[03:06:42.597 --> 03:06:44.157]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[03:06:44.437 --> 03:06:50.819]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[03:06:50.819 --> 03:06:57.201]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:06:57.201 --> 03:07:01.462]  BrainForce, it's completely different.
[03:07:01.462 --> 03:07:02.683]  Try a bottle of it.
[03:07:02.683 --> 03:07:04.263]  Rob Due joins us.
[03:07:04.263 --> 03:07:07.384]  You worked, I guess, like 20-plus hours.
[03:07:07.384 --> 03:07:08.444]  Tell us what BrainForce did.
[03:07:08.444 --> 03:07:09.425]  I'd been working all day.
[03:07:09.425 --> 03:07:11.925]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[03:07:11.925 --> 03:07:12.926]  I get in here at 830.
[03:07:13.906 --> 03:07:15.528]  I was kind of run down, you know.
[03:07:15.528 --> 03:07:17.169]  I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[03:07:17.169 --> 03:07:19.051]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[03:07:19.051 --> 03:07:20.892]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[03:07:20.892 --> 03:07:21.933]  I popped two of them.
[03:07:21.933 --> 03:07:24.215]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[03:07:24.215 --> 03:07:26.197]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[03:07:26.197 --> 03:07:27.678]  It's got four and a half stars.
[03:07:27.678 --> 03:07:29.019]  People really love it.
[03:07:29.019 --> 03:07:29.600]  Read about it.
[03:07:29.600 --> 03:07:33.443]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[03:07:33.443 --> 03:07:38.728]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[03:07:38.888 --> 03:07:42.931]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[03:07:42.931 --> 03:07:49.076]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[03:07:49.076 --> 03:07:55.001]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:08:01.328 --> 03:08:09.196]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[03:08:09.196 --> 03:08:17.123]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[03:08:17.123 --> 03:08:19.225]  As president, I will make it clear.
[03:08:20.146 --> 03:08:30.811]  If the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack, we will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[03:08:30.811 --> 03:08:34.372]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[03:08:34.372 --> 03:08:37.233]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[03:08:37.233 --> 03:08:39.794]  We came, you saw, he died.
[03:08:42.188 --> 03:08:44.570]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[03:08:44.570 --> 03:08:48.254]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[03:08:48.254 --> 03:08:56.122]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[03:08:58.052 --> 03:08:58.572]  The U.S.
[03:08:58.572 --> 03:09:02.535]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[03:09:02.535 --> 03:09:10.520]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[03:09:10.520 --> 03:09:13.242]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[03:09:13.242 --> 03:09:17.585]  Of course not, because she's... Look, there's a really loud noise.
[03:09:17.585 --> 03:09:21.627]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[03:09:21.627 --> 03:09:23.849]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[03:09:27.679 --> 03:09:32.098]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[03:10:00.390 --> 03:10:06.894]  The waiting room has been closed, and the two Presley brothers are in there without any observers whatsoever.
[03:10:06.894 --> 03:10:07.875]  And that is not okay.
[03:10:07.875 --> 03:10:08.315]  Can I take these?
[03:10:08.315 --> 03:10:09.056]  They're switching off computers.
[03:10:09.056 --> 03:10:17.181]  They just took one in, and now they're taking another one out.
[03:10:17.181 --> 03:10:22.225]  I was wondering why would a PC do that.
[03:10:23.550 --> 03:10:27.200]  Taking computers out of the building.
[03:10:27.200 --> 03:10:28.644]  The guy wasn't listening.
[03:10:28.644 --> 03:10:30.148]  He was now walking away.
[03:10:30.148 --> 03:10:30.930]  This was unexpected.
[03:10:41.903 --> 03:10:43.704]  Beth Harris, I've been on air 21 years.
[03:10:43.704 --> 03:10:46.406]  I've interviewed you probably 30 times over the years.
[03:10:46.406 --> 03:10:49.668]  I've never been this blown away watching the video.
[03:10:49.668 --> 03:10:51.409]  It's on screen right now for radio listeners.
[03:10:51.409 --> 03:10:53.290]  They can go to InfoWars.com.
[03:10:53.290 --> 03:10:58.693]  It's in the article, How America's Elections Are Being Hacked, Missing Link Discovered.
[03:10:58.693 --> 03:11:01.154]  This is just so bombshell.
[03:11:01.154 --> 03:11:03.696]  Or just go to BlackBoxVoting.org.
[03:11:03.696 --> 03:11:06.817]  Fraction Magic is the top story there on the left.
[03:11:06.817 --> 03:11:10.319]  Get this video from YouTube and make it go super viral.
[03:11:10.319 --> 03:11:11.040]  Where should we begin?
[03:11:12.401 --> 03:11:20.446]  Well, you know, we've found some new information and I think it's the missing piece that we didn't have before.
[03:11:20.446 --> 03:11:41.160]  A gentleman by the name of Benny Smith, out of Memphis, Tennessee, discovered what I would characterize as a master key, which essentially lets one person control with invisibly and with remarkable precision, down to the precinct level and down to the type of voting, early voting and so forth, whatever type they want.
[03:11:42.353 --> 03:11:43.153]  We're good to go.
[03:12:06.169 --> 03:12:06.369]  I think.
[03:12:24.426 --> 03:12:51.849]  In order to succeed with widespread election fraud and after he did that he went now let me see if the pieces that I know are necessary are built into the system they should not be and he was amazed when he found after looking at the files that the pieces were built in to commit very large-scale fraud using a feature that had been very little known before and so
[03:12:55.213 --> 03:12:56.554]  I don't think so.
[03:13:24.747 --> 03:13:26.049]  You know, the election is done.
[03:13:26.049 --> 03:13:28.313]  Now there is something new that can be done.
[03:13:30.785 --> 03:13:35.288]  Because it's kind of scaring the pants off of them, actually.
[03:13:35.288 --> 03:13:47.015]  And at the very end of the video, I make sort of a cryptic reference to it, but we didn't realize that more than half of the voting machines in the country now take a picture of every ballot.
[03:13:47.015 --> 03:13:53.360]  Even the touchscreen machines that supposedly have no paper are keeping an image of every ballot.
[03:13:53.360 --> 03:13:54.660]  But now think about this.
[03:13:54.660 --> 03:13:59.323]  You run a paper ballot through, and it takes a picture of it, and that's just an electronic file, right?
[03:14:02.090 --> 03:14:02.230]  Wow.
[03:14:23.527 --> 03:14:28.730]  These ballot images are, and must be, public record.
[03:14:28.730 --> 03:14:30.972]  And people must ask for them.
[03:14:30.972 --> 03:14:34.614]  Now, let me tell you what happened when a gentleman from Arizona asked for them.
[03:14:34.614 --> 03:14:38.837]  He said, OK, I want, under my freedom of information rights, I want all your ballot images.
[03:14:38.837 --> 03:14:41.278]  Basically, you can do your own recount that way, right?
[03:14:41.278 --> 03:14:45.481]  And we did find that they do not succumb to the Fraction Magic attack.
[03:14:45.481 --> 03:14:50.624]  Well, when he asked for them, they said, oh, well, we destroy them every day.
[03:14:51.084 --> 03:14:53.685]  Ben, I know you never like it, but let me tell you something.
[03:14:53.685 --> 03:14:59.907]  I mean, I interviewed the other vote fraud experts that were before you, the Collier brothers and others, and they died, and their daughter, she's great, and other folks.
[03:14:59.907 --> 03:15:02.328]  I'm just saying, you are so dynamic.
[03:15:02.328 --> 03:15:06.029]  You've done with your crew and the folks ten times when anybody else ever did.
[03:15:06.029 --> 03:15:09.470]  So that's why I single you out, because you're amazing, and you're such a treasure.
[03:15:12.136 --> 03:15:16.878]  All right, that's a boil down of the exclusive Bev Harris breaking news yesterday.
[03:15:16.878 --> 03:15:17.978]  It's so huge.
[03:15:17.978 --> 03:15:22.260]  Only Drudge Report has picked it up and a few other Liberty-based outlets.
[03:15:22.260 --> 03:15:31.584]  It's gotten millions and millions of readers and viewers, but you'd think national news that has had her with HBO documentaries and she's been all over CNN, Fox, she's been everywhere.
[03:15:31.584 --> 03:15:37.847]  As the consummate expert, she discovers the biggest news of her 20-year research into this.
[03:15:38.581 --> 03:15:43.622]  He was a former top federal fraud investigator before that, and there's been no coverage so far.
[03:15:43.622 --> 03:15:45.443]  Maybe since I got on air there has been.
[03:15:45.443 --> 03:15:48.884]  We should Google that or search engine that, but that is such a big video.
[03:15:48.884 --> 03:15:50.384]  That's the boil down of the hour interview.
[03:15:50.384 --> 03:15:55.226]  We're going to be posting that in the next hour or so to InfoWars.com.
[03:15:55.226 --> 03:16:03.648]  Now joining us for the next 45 minutes in studio, but also going to do some taped interviews with us for the nightly news, are Kathy Shelton and Candace Jackson.
[03:16:03.648 --> 03:16:04.888]  And Candace Jackson is a
[03:16:07.009 --> 03:16:09.472]  Graduate of Honors from Stanford University, a lawyer.
[03:16:09.472 --> 03:16:15.057]  I'm not going to get into her whole background, but she's just a great lady.
[03:16:15.057 --> 03:16:17.020]  They're not seeking anything right now from Bill Clinton.
[03:16:18.168 --> 03:16:20.690]  They're not out to even get anybody here.
[03:16:20.690 --> 03:16:23.393]  They're not out to get Hillary Clinton.
[03:16:23.393 --> 03:16:32.001]  They're just talking about the reality of what happened to her when she was a 12-year-old girl so long ago when Hillary Clinton was a young lawyer.
[03:16:32.001 --> 03:16:35.624]  And so they're just seeking for the public to be aware of this.
[03:16:35.624 --> 03:16:36.465]  Now, we've played the tapes.
[03:16:36.465 --> 03:16:37.205]  We'll play them later.
[03:16:37.205 --> 03:16:40.588]  I know it's hard for Kathy to listen to of Hillary making jokes about
[03:16:41.693 --> 03:16:54.182]  Uh, the man that reportedly, uh, who she got off, but, uh, raped her when she was 12 years old, and she was in a coma for days, and that's not disputed, and Hillary laughs that she knew he was guilty, but, you know, he took a lie detector and passed it, so it destroyed her confidence in lie detectors.
[03:16:54.182 --> 03:16:57.105]  It just shows the true mindset, the predatory nature.
[03:16:57.805 --> 03:16:59.265]  of what we're dealing with.
[03:16:59.265 --> 03:17:01.326]  TheirLivesFoundation.net.
[03:17:01.326 --> 03:17:04.207]  TheirLivesFoundation.net.
[03:17:04.207 --> 03:17:10.789]  And again, Candace Jackson is her lawyer, just on her own dime, here doing this because she cares about women's issues and justice.
[03:17:10.789 --> 03:17:13.490]  Cathy and Candace, thank you so much for joining us.
[03:17:13.490 --> 03:17:14.990]  Thank you.
[03:17:14.990 --> 03:17:15.590]  Wow.
[03:17:15.590 --> 03:17:17.971]  You know, so much to cover, so much to talk about.
[03:17:17.971 --> 03:17:24.153]  I'm going to skip this break so we have more time, because I got to you late playing those clips.
[03:17:25.478 --> 03:17:26.819]  Why are you here first?
[03:17:26.819 --> 03:17:34.728]  I mean, for TV viewers and radio listeners, I mean, I think I kind of described what you talked about on your foundation site when I've heard you say, I know you were at the debates, Mr. Trump had you there.
[03:17:37.132 --> 03:17:38.274]  Why are you speaking out now?
[03:17:38.274 --> 03:17:40.016]  Your case is documented.
[03:17:40.016 --> 03:17:40.476]  It's a fact.
[03:17:40.476 --> 03:17:41.137]  What happened to you?
[03:17:41.137 --> 03:17:44.842]  Why are you speaking out?
[03:17:44.842 --> 03:17:54.634]  Because Hillary's on tape laughing and saying that she knows that they're guilty and has made some other remarks.
[03:17:56.219 --> 03:18:11.323]  Uh, down the line and I'm standing up for what's right for me because I know it happened and she's trying to make me look like a liar and that I asked for it and all that.
[03:18:11.323 --> 03:18:15.224]  And by the way, we should pull up a photo of you when you were 12.
[03:18:15.224 --> 03:18:16.065]  That's online.
[03:18:16.065 --> 03:18:18.025]  People can also go to theirlivesfoundation.net.
[03:18:18.025 --> 03:18:22.166]  We can put that website on screen for people so we can personalize this.
[03:18:22.166 --> 03:18:23.346]  I mean, you were a little girl.
[03:18:23.346 --> 03:18:24.687]  I have a 12-year-old daughter.
[03:18:25.307 --> 03:18:30.635]  I have an eight-year-old daughter, and you know, before I had daughters and children, I would get upset hearing about abuse of women and children.
[03:18:30.635 --> 03:18:38.346]  But now, I mean, I'm going to be honest, it makes me just start feeling very violent.
[03:18:38.346 --> 03:18:41.350]  Whenever I think about people abusing little girls, especially.
[03:18:43.163 --> 03:18:52.333]  I think what can't be underestimated is you take a case like this and the level of violence, this was, rape is always a horrible crime.
[03:18:52.333 --> 03:18:54.575]  This was no ordinary rape.
[03:18:54.575 --> 03:19:01.422]  He beat and almost murdered this little girl so badly, she was in a coma for five days.
[03:19:01.422 --> 03:19:04.885]  So you top that off with there being absolutely zero justice.
[03:19:05.646 --> 03:19:07.628]  For the victim, Kathy, in this case.
[03:19:07.628 --> 03:19:09.551]  And that makes it a double tragedy.
[03:19:09.551 --> 03:19:14.897]  And that was deliberately designed and pulled off by Hillary Clinton.
[03:19:14.897 --> 03:19:22.986]  Again, Candace Jackson, tell folks why you've gotten involved and then just encapsulate the case and we'll get into the personal things.
[03:19:25.401 --> 03:19:38.130]  You know, Cathy's gone through it, but Candace, looking at this, I mean, what makes you a busy person, run your own law firm, very successful, all these big letters to your name, candaceejackson.com, what makes you spend so much time and energy on this and then break down the nuts and bolts of the case?
[03:19:38.729 --> 03:19:48.993]  Well, you know, I have, over the years, writing about it, speaking about it, gotten to know some of the women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual abuse very well.
[03:19:48.993 --> 03:20:01.818]  And I realized this year that Cathy's story is one that, it's so different, it's so unique, it really does represent the epitome of the type of corruption that Hillary Clinton practices.
[03:20:02.378 --> 03:20:03.960]  Nothing to do with her husband Bill Clinton.
[03:20:03.960 --> 03:20:15.973]  It has everything to do with her choices, Hillary's own choices and decisions to bend and break rules, ignore protocol and procedures, cheat the system, rig the system to get an outcome that she wants.
[03:20:15.973 --> 03:20:17.735]  And by the way, we now learn about Tim Kaine.
[03:20:19.136 --> 03:20:24.619]  Would cry when horrible rapists and killers and people, he was unable to get them off.
[03:20:24.619 --> 03:20:26.540]  And he said he enjoyed it.
[03:20:26.540 --> 03:20:29.562]  There's these videos of him acting really weird.
[03:20:29.562 --> 03:20:31.183]  It's like some type of celebration.
[03:20:31.183 --> 03:20:32.604]  It's like, who are these people?
[03:20:33.510 --> 03:20:50.223]  Well, you look at Hillary Clinton's career and it baffles me so much that she has been allowed, mostly by our mainstream press and to the shame of her own party, to somehow be held up as some kind of champion for women and fighter for justice for children through 40 years of her career.
[03:20:50.643 --> 03:20:55.346]  When time after time, she's chosen the side of rapists just to make herself look good.
[03:20:55.346 --> 03:20:56.386]  Win this case.
[03:20:56.386 --> 03:21:01.049]  Put into practice principles of liberal philosophy with regard to criminal policy.
[03:21:01.049 --> 03:21:02.409]  Let's not lock them up.
[03:21:02.409 --> 03:21:04.050]  It's not really the criminal's fault.
[03:21:04.050 --> 03:21:05.391]  Let's get them back out on the street.
[03:21:05.391 --> 03:21:08.172]  I'll tell you what, Counselor, for TV viewers, there's camera two.
[03:21:08.172 --> 03:21:11.654]  I mean, lay out, this is a fact, I mean, lay out what happened in this case to people.
[03:21:13.055 --> 03:21:14.776]  Right over there, you know, staring at folks in TV lane.
[03:21:14.776 --> 03:21:21.518]  Anytime you want to jump in and talk to Hillary Clinton, you know, talk to the media, because they can't deny your case.
[03:21:21.518 --> 03:21:22.338]  I mean, it's so powerful.
[03:21:22.338 --> 03:21:25.379]  And they're trying to take stuff with Trump and blow it out of proportion.
[03:21:25.379 --> 03:21:25.979]  Fine.
[03:21:25.979 --> 03:21:31.701]  If they ever got in trouble, then we could talk about Trump with something 50 times less, 100 times less.
[03:21:31.701 --> 03:21:32.661]  It's the hypocrisy.
[03:21:32.661 --> 03:21:35.062]  So, so, so, counselor, you know, talking to the viewers out there.
[03:21:35.382 --> 03:21:37.645]  The hypocrisy is astounding.
[03:21:37.645 --> 03:21:44.714]  You've got somebody out there who claims to be an early feminist, a fighter and defender and champion for women and children.
[03:21:44.714 --> 03:21:48.779]  That's her main pitch for herself is, I'm a woman.
[03:21:48.779 --> 03:21:51.162]  Vote for me to put the first woman in office.
[03:21:51.162 --> 03:21:52.724]  I've spent my life defending children.
[03:21:52.724 --> 03:21:53.966]  And here's what she did in this case.
[03:21:55.242 --> 03:21:58.927]  Her defenders will say she was court appointed.
[03:21:58.927 --> 03:22:01.030]  She had no choice.
[03:22:01.030 --> 03:22:05.716]  She had to accept this case and then an attorney has to defend her client.
[03:22:06.650 --> 03:22:07.511]  Wrong.
[03:22:07.511 --> 03:22:11.375]  Hillary Clinton has been lying about this case her entire career.
[03:22:11.375 --> 03:22:15.439]  In her autobiography, she lies about how and why she accepted this case.
[03:22:15.439 --> 03:22:21.765]  In the audio taped interviews that exist when she chooses to talk about this case to a journalist, she's lying.
[03:22:21.765 --> 03:22:23.987]  She was not a public defender.
[03:22:23.987 --> 03:22:27.330]  She was not required by any judge to accept this appointment.
[03:22:27.330 --> 03:22:30.653]  She knew that the victim in this case was a sixth grade
[03:22:31.334 --> 03:22:31.834]  We're good to go.
[03:22:53.793 --> 03:22:53.953]  I don't
[03:23:14.901 --> 03:23:22.607]  I was about to say, studying this, it's one thing if you're a defense lawyer and you give people a good show and you give them a fair shake even if you know they're guilty.
[03:23:22.607 --> 03:23:32.515]  She, with glee and every dirty trick and pouring it on, stuff that I think, I'm not a constitutional lawyer like you but I've studied it, really could get somebody disbarred in a lot of counties.
[03:23:33.197 --> 03:23:39.342]  Oh, well, here's the types of tactics that she chose to use in this case.
[03:23:39.342 --> 03:23:44.947]  She made up lies wholesale about Kathy and her family.
[03:23:44.947 --> 03:23:49.451]  She said that Kathy was fantasizing about older men.
[03:23:49.451 --> 03:23:51.272]  And before we go there, why don't you recap what happened?
[03:23:51.272 --> 03:23:54.215]  I mean, I know it's hard for Kathy to talk about, but maybe you should.
[03:23:54.215 --> 03:23:58.639]  Kathy, do you want to tell folks, just look at the camera over there and tell folks what happened to you?
[03:23:59.913 --> 03:24:15.683]  Um, I was riding my bicycle, or going a couple blocks riding my bicycle over to church and my mother really didn't want me to but she let me and said after church she'd pick me up in the bicycle.
[03:24:15.683 --> 03:24:24.248]  Um, I talked her into it because it was still daylight because she always worried about me but um,
[03:24:26.075 --> 03:24:28.976]  It was like a couple blocks away on the way over there.
[03:24:28.976 --> 03:24:32.678]  This truck stopped.
[03:24:32.678 --> 03:24:40.261]  Two men got out of it and started coming towards me and it scared me really bad.
[03:24:40.261 --> 03:24:43.302]  They told me I was going with them and I said no I'm not.
[03:24:43.302 --> 03:24:44.943]  I tried to get away but I couldn't.
[03:24:45.814 --> 03:24:48.115]  They jerked me off my bicycle.
[03:24:48.115 --> 03:24:50.036]  They put me in the truck.
[03:24:50.036 --> 03:24:54.077]  They started ripping my clothes off of me.
[03:24:54.077 --> 03:24:57.819]  I was screaming and crying, trying to holler for help.
[03:24:57.819 --> 03:25:01.120]  And it was like no one heard me.
[03:25:01.120 --> 03:25:06.582]  We go out on a road somewhere, just this plum fields.
[03:25:06.582 --> 03:25:08.823]  I don't remember what road it is today.
[03:25:08.823 --> 03:25:10.824]  I remember all the fields.
[03:25:12.289 --> 03:25:24.078]  And they were beating me, and they raped me, and he was saying he knew I liked it, except in a more terribly manner than that.
[03:25:27.992 --> 03:25:34.118]  I was left out on the ground, barely conscious.
[03:25:34.118 --> 03:25:37.942]  Sometimes, at one time, I was unconscious.
[03:25:37.942 --> 03:25:41.606]  I crawled to a porch out of nowhere.
[03:25:41.606 --> 03:25:44.649]  I don't know where the house was or how I made it there.
[03:25:45.550 --> 03:26:03.059]  But they thought they had killed me and they were coming back for me and the lady at the porch I crawled at turned her porch light on and it scared them back off and she got their tag number and that's how they caught him today.
[03:26:03.059 --> 03:26:07.481]  Well a girl beat in a field and reportedly you were in a coma for what five days?
[03:26:07.481 --> 03:26:12.184]  Yes I woke up in the hospital five days later out of a coma and was told
[03:26:12.944 --> 03:26:22.289]  That I couldn't, 99% chance I couldn't have kids and I had several sisters down in my private area.
[03:26:22.289 --> 03:26:27.092]  Now, now, I've read some about this but correct me if I'm wrong, these were like kind of the cool good old boys or something?
[03:26:27.092 --> 03:26:40.499]  So I guess they kind of got special treatment and then they must have been crazy good old boys to think you could rape a little girl out in the middle of a field and then get your tags, you know, documented and still not, you know, basically fry for it.
[03:26:41.386 --> 03:26:47.968]  You know, to be honest, there's still a lot of unanswered questions and a lot unknown about the background of this case.
[03:26:47.968 --> 03:26:57.050]  We've been working very hard at Their Lives Foundation as a pure act of love to try to uncover facts around this case.
[03:26:57.050 --> 03:26:58.530]  It's not easy to do.
[03:26:58.530 --> 03:27:05.072]  Not surprisingly, in a case like this, that the Clintons would prefer remain buried and hidden, lots of records have disappeared.
[03:27:05.952 --> 03:27:06.673]  I don't know.
[03:27:27.443 --> 03:27:38.093]  Sure, well a lot of the left has made a big deal about rape culture and God, I know it goes on, but then they project it onto like, you know, stuff where it's very vague and maybe she, you know, had too much to drink and she didn't know.
[03:27:38.093 --> 03:27:39.054]  Okay, fine, whatever.
[03:27:39.054 --> 03:27:40.476]  That's bad, don't do it.
[03:27:40.476 --> 03:27:46.201]  But when people are beating and raping 12-year-old girls and ripping their bodies open and putting them in comas, I have daughters.
[03:27:46.201 --> 03:27:48.603]  I'm not, I mean, seriously, it makes me so angry.
[03:27:49.508 --> 03:27:58.471]  I don't usually shoot my mouth off about being aggressive, but I just can't see how Hillary and the judge and the town and everybody just didn't care.
[03:27:58.471 --> 03:28:01.633]  I mean, they were just throwing you away.
[03:28:01.633 --> 03:28:03.033]  Yes, sir, they was.
[03:28:03.033 --> 03:28:11.136]  And she is now, today, telling stories like it was a family member.
[03:28:11.136 --> 03:28:14.737]  And I've said they can check my family history.
[03:28:14.737 --> 03:28:15.838]  He's not no family member.
[03:28:18.121 --> 03:28:27.829]  They asked me to get in the truck, offered me a coke to get in, and that is not true.
[03:28:27.829 --> 03:28:30.592]  I've heard several different stories now.
[03:28:30.592 --> 03:28:34.575]  There's all kinds of stories going around that's not true.
[03:28:34.575 --> 03:28:37.478]  We all know how it works in Arkansas and some areas of Texas.
[03:28:37.478 --> 03:28:38.799]  Money gets paid, people get off.
[03:28:39.184 --> 03:28:42.545]  Sure, and I think that there was a legitimate divide.
[03:28:42.545 --> 03:28:50.868]  Not every single person involved with this case was happy and pleased about the fact that a violent criminal in their community went free.
[03:28:50.868 --> 03:29:04.213]  But people like the judge and the judge's son, and even the prosecutor to some extent, were on the Democrat-Liberal side of things philosophically and truly believe that rehabilitation should trump punishment.
[03:29:04.213 --> 03:29:06.714]  And maybe it's not criminal's fault that they act this way.
[03:29:06.854 --> 03:29:15.683]  Sure, and we have the audio of Hillary, we've played it many times, we'll probably play it when we come back, admitting she knew he was guilty, she couldn't believe it, that he passed a lie detector which destroyed her faith in lie detectors, then laughs about it.
[03:29:15.683 --> 03:29:20.087]  And again, it's not just once, she got kicked off the Watergate Committee for falsifying stuff.
[03:29:20.087 --> 03:29:24.592]  Her whole life is like doing evil things, when doing good would have been better for her.
[03:29:25.287 --> 03:29:26.028]  You would think so.
[03:29:26.028 --> 03:29:34.674]  Why would she stand up and try to get this rapist off when she could have joined the side of the victim and spoken up like some early Gloria Allred on the side of the victim.
[03:29:34.674 --> 03:29:38.297]  But no, she chooses the side of the rapist every time.
[03:29:38.297 --> 03:29:41.039]  And now her and Michelle want to get up and be all breathless about Donald Trump.
[03:29:41.039 --> 03:29:42.060]  And oh, they're so scared.
[03:29:42.060 --> 03:29:44.782]  And so we'll be right back with both of our guests.
[03:29:44.782 --> 03:29:46.083]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[03:29:46.083 --> 03:29:46.624]  Stay with us.
[03:29:49.173 --> 03:29:53.097]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.097 --> 03:29:55.781]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.966 --> 03:30:06.771]  Well, it looks like President-elect Donald Trump is making good on his promises day one of the Trump presidency to withdraw from the TPP.
[03:30:06.771 --> 03:30:10.814]  We have an article, it's up on our website, Infowars.com, and aggregated from CNS News.
[03:30:10.814 --> 03:30:17.019]  It talks about how Trump characterized the move, a part of a plan to advance the simple core principle of quote, putting America first.
[03:30:17.019 --> 03:30:20.382]  Of course, that's been his credo down with globalism the entire campaign.
[03:30:20.382 --> 03:30:28.468]  And now that President-elect Donald Trump, who said on Monday that his first day in office next January will be to begin the process of withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
[03:30:28.888 --> 03:30:29.488]  We're good to go.
[03:30:59.747 --> 03:31:01.629]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:31:01.629 --> 03:31:03.651]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:31:03.651 --> 03:31:06.453]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:31:06.453 --> 03:31:12.639]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:31:12.639 --> 03:31:20.006]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[03:31:20.126 --> 03:31:21.807]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:31:21.807 --> 03:31:29.350]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:31:29.350 --> 03:31:37.374]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:31:37.374 --> 03:31:38.355]  The general public doesn't.
[03:31:39.549 --> 03:31:42.933]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:31:42.933 --> 03:31:47.078]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:31:47.078 --> 03:31:53.786]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:31:53.786 --> 03:31:57.891]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:31:59.821 --> 03:32:06.364]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[03:32:06.364 --> 03:32:09.585]  Dr. Group, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[03:32:09.585 --> 03:32:15.167]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[03:32:15.167 --> 03:32:21.290]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[03:32:21.290 --> 03:32:24.571]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[03:32:24.571 --> 03:32:26.032]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[03:32:26.232 --> 03:32:30.533]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[03:32:30.533 --> 03:32:33.474]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[03:32:33.474 --> 03:32:35.135]  It works like an antioxidant.
[03:32:35.135 --> 03:32:38.576]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[03:32:38.576 --> 03:32:41.176]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[03:32:41.176 --> 03:32:42.237]  It's in powder form.
[03:32:42.237 --> 03:32:45.118]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[03:32:45.118 --> 03:32:45.838]  I take this.
[03:32:45.838 --> 03:32:47.638]  This is the product that I take.
[03:32:47.638 --> 03:32:49.619]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[03:32:50.439 --> 03:32:51.239]  We fight the Globals.
[03:32:51.239 --> 03:32:52.380]  We fight the New World Order.
[03:32:52.380 --> 03:32:57.101]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLive.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[03:32:57.101 --> 03:33:09.124]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:33:09.124 --> 03:33:10.144]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:25.476 --> 03:33:26.657]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:33:26.657 --> 03:33:29.918]  We're now T-minus six days out from the most historic election in U.S.
[03:33:29.918 --> 03:33:30.418]  history.
[03:33:30.418 --> 03:33:44.424]  Every corrupt, evil regime from the communist Chinese, the biggest mass murderers in history, the biggest abusers of women in history, the Saudi Arabians, and all the big banks and the major media and the think tanks and the lobbyists are lined up against Donald Trump.
[03:33:44.424 --> 03:33:49.106]  They came out with this outrageous claim that no one would run with for months.
[03:33:49.106 --> 03:33:50.386]  I mean, we'd even seen it floating around.
[03:33:51.807 --> 03:33:53.547]  They had tracked some server.
[03:33:53.547 --> 03:34:00.229]  They could easily, if they were really smart, get into one of his hundreds of hotels and things and actually make a link and create a false flag, but they don't even do that.
[03:34:00.229 --> 03:34:05.570]  They go, oh, we have chatter between a Russian server and Trump.
[03:34:05.570 --> 03:34:09.391]  Even the New York Times said it's total bull.
[03:34:09.391 --> 03:34:12.072]  Turned out, it came out in the New York Times today, drudged up the big headline.
[03:34:13.442 --> 03:34:20.314]  That they have been inside investigating Trump, the FBI has, with warrants, everything, digging through.
[03:34:20.314 --> 03:34:23.279]  That's why he kept saying, I'm under an audit right now, I can't tell you.
[03:34:25.182 --> 03:34:27.164]  Didn't tell you they edited the Billy Bush tape.
[03:34:27.164 --> 03:34:31.027]  Totally, you could hear it, but now it's going to come out after the whole deal.
[03:34:31.027 --> 03:34:35.210]  Because he knows the public will think he's looking like a wimp if he sits there and doesn't just apologize.
[03:34:35.210 --> 03:34:36.231]  And I'm saying what he did was perfect.
[03:34:36.231 --> 03:34:39.713]  Billy Bush goes, actually I go to him for an hour to tell me sex stories and then we edit it.
[03:34:39.713 --> 03:34:41.415]  I mean, that's what they got.
[03:34:41.415 --> 03:34:46.879]  But the point is, is that Hillary's the one with the secret server to the Russians.
[03:34:46.879 --> 03:34:47.920]  Podesta's the one.
[03:34:47.920 --> 03:34:51.823]  Everything they do, they then accuse us of.
[03:34:51.823 --> 03:34:53.164]  They accuse me of being a Russian agent.
[03:34:55.846 --> 03:34:57.110]  Babushka means a baby?
[03:34:57.110 --> 03:35:00.159]  I think goulash means like that good...
[03:35:01.212 --> 03:35:03.633]  Like soup, you know, like hash, meat.
[03:35:03.633 --> 03:35:05.633]  I mean, I don't know anything about Russians.
[03:35:05.633 --> 03:35:07.233]  I want to go to Russia someday.
[03:35:07.233 --> 03:35:08.354]  I hear it's really neat to see.
[03:35:08.354 --> 03:35:09.274]  It's historical.
[03:35:09.274 --> 03:35:11.575]  I've read history books about it.
[03:35:11.575 --> 03:35:20.317]  But I mean, it's just like I'm sitting here defending the republic, just trying to sustain our country and get some tax cuts so we get our economy going.
[03:35:20.317 --> 03:35:21.837]  I mean, call a Russian agent.
[03:35:21.837 --> 03:35:24.298]  America is rejecting all of this big time.
[03:35:26.638 --> 03:35:32.022]  I've never gotten into a campaign like this because it was usually, you know, McCain, Obama, eh, you know.
[03:35:32.022 --> 03:35:33.343]  Now, this is so clear.
[03:35:35.782 --> 03:35:39.763]  This is such an incredible time to be alive, just to repudiate the entire system.
[03:35:39.763 --> 03:35:41.783]  Does it mean we're going to be on some bed of roses after that?
[03:35:41.783 --> 03:35:42.284]  Absolutely not.
[03:35:42.284 --> 03:35:48.445]  We're going back to our guest, a constitutional lawyer, Candace Jackson, and of course, Kathy Shelton, their lives.
[03:35:48.445 --> 03:35:56.847]  Foundation.net, with all she's gone through, confirmed, raped at 12 years old, Hillary Clinton admitting in tapes, we're going to play some of it, that she knew that her client was guilty.
[03:35:58.527 --> 03:36:01.810]  But didn't care, because he was all part of this Politico system.
[03:36:01.810 --> 03:36:04.332]  Before we go any further, though, then LeeAnne's going to be popping in.
[03:36:04.332 --> 03:36:06.113]  I asked her to come on.
[03:36:06.113 --> 03:36:07.815]  LeeAnne is so humble as a reporter.
[03:36:07.815 --> 03:36:11.157]  She's an expert on this case, really following it, is doing a piece on the nightly news.
[03:36:11.157 --> 03:36:12.098]  I said, well, you come on, LeeAnne.
[03:36:12.098 --> 03:36:12.518]  Talk about this.
[03:36:12.518 --> 03:36:14.360]  And she's like, I don't want to barge in and everything.
[03:36:14.360 --> 03:36:16.221]  I said, LeeAnne, it's the media.
[03:36:16.221 --> 03:36:17.082]  You're going on air.
[03:36:17.082 --> 03:36:17.883]  Everybody loves LeeAnne.
[03:36:18.523 --> 03:36:21.906]  So she's coming on to talk to us here in just a moment, bring up some of her points.
[03:36:21.906 --> 03:36:30.374]  But we have the final 24 hours to save 30 to 40% off on super high quality, produced here in America, in Utah, storable foods.
[03:36:31.657 --> 03:36:32.097]  24 hours left.
[03:36:32.097 --> 03:36:35.320]  Normally, we have a 10% discount, private labeling, MyPatriotSupply.
[03:36:35.320 --> 03:36:36.340]  It's the exact same food.
[03:36:36.340 --> 03:36:39.522]  We sell their whole catalog right next to it at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:36:39.522 --> 03:36:43.204]  But we can do this occasionally under our contract, 30 to 40% off.
[03:36:43.204 --> 03:36:46.807]  The lowest discount is 30%, as high as 40.
[03:36:46.807 --> 03:36:48.328]  Now is the time to take action.
[03:36:48.328 --> 03:36:54.131]  There's a reason FEMA report predicts a 395% increase in food prices that could trigger a mass unrest.
[03:36:54.131 --> 03:36:56.033]  Look at all the stuff that globalists are doing.
[03:36:56.033 --> 03:36:57.093]  They want us dependent.
[03:36:57.093 --> 03:36:57.994]  We should be independent.
[03:36:59.997 --> 03:37:03.620]  We don't know exactly what's coming, but we can start getting ready for whatever may happen.

[03:37:22.374 --> 03:37:22.935]  And finally,
[03:37:24.025 --> 03:37:27.466]  Some of our sponsors, Solutions from Science Solar Generator.
[03:37:27.466 --> 03:37:35.510]  I bought one from them, now they've upgraded it many times, 10 years ago, because it was the best, highest rated, lowest cost, expandable unit.
[03:37:35.510 --> 03:37:37.871]  So I wanted to start with something medium size and build out.
[03:37:37.871 --> 03:37:41.613]  A control panel, you know, and a few panels.
[03:37:41.613 --> 03:37:43.113]  I bought another one last year.
[03:37:43.113 --> 03:37:44.754]  I actually had one for the office, one for home.
[03:37:46.044 --> 03:37:46.284]  Of course!
[03:38:02.586 --> 03:38:03.827]  Military-grade electronics.

[03:38:17.512 --> 03:38:21.414]  It is your purchase and support of the products and everything we do here that makes it all possible.
[03:38:22.034 --> 03:38:26.176]  I'm not bragging, but we've got reporters covering live Danny Williams press conferences.
[03:38:26.176 --> 03:38:30.177]  We've got reporters out with all the, you know, political events that are happening.
[03:38:30.177 --> 03:38:44.003]  We are breaking many of the major news stories every day that are game changers in the promotion of private property, the Second Amendment, justice, sovereignty, common sense, Americana, free association, classical liberalism.
[03:38:44.003 --> 03:38:45.163]  We're the tip of the spear.
[03:38:45.163 --> 03:38:48.485]  And I want to thank you, listeners, for your prayers, your support.
[03:38:49.165 --> 03:38:54.274]  Visiting the store, spreading the word, sending our videos out because I don't want to be a slave of the globalists.
[03:38:54.274 --> 03:38:55.796]  You don't want to be a slave of the globalists.
[03:38:55.796 --> 03:39:01.686]  We're all in this together and our ideas, our understanding is becoming the main narrative because it's real.
[03:39:01.686 --> 03:39:02.247]  The military.
[03:39:03.373 --> 03:39:04.494]  From the highest level to the lowest.
[03:39:04.494 --> 03:39:07.016]  Clicks with us because they know what we're saying is accurate.
[03:39:07.016 --> 03:39:09.979]  It's not the fantasy land that's on mainstream TV.
[03:39:09.979 --> 03:39:10.960]  And we're real people.
[03:39:10.960 --> 03:39:12.041]  We're not scripted.
[03:39:12.041 --> 03:39:13.923]  We didn't script this interview beforehand.
[03:39:13.923 --> 03:39:15.865]  We didn't script that press conference you just saw.
[03:39:15.865 --> 03:39:20.089]  We're just taking action, rolling our sleeves up, and doing the best job we can.
[03:39:20.089 --> 03:39:23.312]  So Candace Jackson, again, a lawyer, just free of charge doing this.
[03:39:23.772 --> 03:39:48.630]  I'm doing a great job with Kathy Shelton, the 12-year-old, she was a rape victim by a whole bunch of men, in a coma for five days, her body torn apart, theirlivesoundation.net, we put up images of you when you were 12, and what happened, Candace, recapping this, and why it's such a miscarriage of justice, and then anytime, Kathy, you want to pop in, and then we've got Leanne McAdoo, who I drug in here, because she's really hot about this case, she's angry about it, and I am too.
[03:39:49.602 --> 03:39:51.662]  Well, people should be angry about this case.
[03:39:51.662 --> 03:40:13.186]  It is unbelievable the hypocrisy that Hillary Clinton is getting away with to have this reputation and self-promotion as a defender of women and children's rights activists and then deliberately, voluntarily choose to take the side of a child rapist here and do not only everything within the bounds of legal ethics and law to get him off.
[03:40:13.186 --> 03:40:17.067]  That would be bad enough that she chose to do that and be on his side.
[03:40:18.127 --> 03:40:25.713]  But in order to win her case, in order to look good, in order to prove that she can win, she bent the rules.
[03:40:25.713 --> 03:40:27.574]  She went outside proper procedure.
[03:40:27.574 --> 03:40:29.856]  She violated court orders.
[03:40:29.856 --> 03:40:34.439]  These are things that we're uncovering by the day in this case because, hey, guess what?
[03:40:34.439 --> 03:40:36.741]  The mainstream media has never bothered to do it.
[03:40:37.301 --> 03:40:43.990]  They've taken Hillary Clinton's previous explanations and descriptions of this case at face value and never challenged a bit of it.
[03:40:43.990 --> 03:40:47.654]  And we are unraveling everything she has ever said about this case.
[03:40:47.654 --> 03:40:49.557]  And it turns out most of it's flat out lies.
[03:40:52.961 --> 03:40:54.602]  They admit you got raped, this happened.
[03:40:54.602 --> 03:40:56.402]  They admit you got grabbed in the truck and taken off.
[03:40:56.402 --> 03:41:00.584]  A bunch of 40-year-old men drag a 12-year-old off in a truck to a field.
[03:41:00.584 --> 03:41:02.044]  I say execute every one of them.
[03:41:02.044 --> 03:41:04.285]  You know, I mean, this is so obvious.
[03:41:04.285 --> 03:41:08.967]  How the hell did this happen with this Democrat judge and all this?
[03:41:08.967 --> 03:41:10.407]  And she just gets away with everything.
[03:41:12.455 --> 03:41:16.238]  Yeah, there's a handwritten notation in the court record.
[03:41:16.238 --> 03:41:22.862]  This judge has a history we've learned and uncovered of being pro-work release for criminals, for example.
[03:41:22.862 --> 03:41:29.807]  Get this, he hand wrote a notation in the court order, no objection to release to work during the day.
[03:41:29.807 --> 03:41:36.912]  So even the very little time, few months that this creep actually spent in jail, he was released during the day to go to work.
[03:41:36.912 --> 03:41:38.233]  You know where his workplace was?
[03:41:38.233 --> 03:41:41.436]  A five minute walk away from Kathy Shelton's house.
[03:41:42.216 --> 03:41:48.257]  What kind of judge agrees to do that and what kind of defense attorney asks for that in the first place?
[03:41:48.257 --> 03:41:53.039]  So whatever ended up happening, I mean, I mean, I don't know about the ruling and stuff.
[03:41:53.039 --> 03:42:02.841]  Well, yeah, I mean, in the end, Hillary Clinton monkeyed around with the evidence, manipulated the system enough to argue that there wasn't enough physical evidence to convict.
[03:42:02.841 --> 03:42:04.781]  The prosecutor rolled over in this case, by the way.
[03:42:04.781 --> 03:42:07.362]  There's zero evidence that he challenged Hillary Clinton's
[03:42:08.122 --> 03:42:12.225]  Unsubstantiated stories about the physical evidence not being sufficient.
[03:42:12.225 --> 03:42:29.135]  So between the prosecutor rolling over, also a liberal Democrat, the judge cooperating, and Hillary Clinton having insider help to kind of make all of this happen, the end result was that before jury trial actually occurred, a plea bargain was reached.
[03:42:29.135 --> 03:42:36.399]  The guy pled to a much lesser charge, was sentenced to a year in jail, but it does not appear that he actually spent any time in jail.
[03:42:36.459 --> 03:42:37.680]  I probably should have said that up front.
[03:42:37.680 --> 03:42:38.420]  That's right.
[03:42:38.420 --> 03:42:40.101]  He pled to a lesser charge.
[03:42:40.101 --> 03:42:41.562]  She quote, got him off, but they admitted.
[03:42:41.562 --> 03:42:43.043]  I'm trying to deny it all.
[03:42:43.043 --> 03:42:43.564]  They've done this.
[03:42:43.564 --> 03:42:46.786]  And I just can't believe the community didn't lynch these people.
[03:42:46.786 --> 03:42:49.367]  Because again, I've read the old newspaper articles.
[03:42:49.367 --> 03:42:50.168]  It was so cut and dry.
[03:42:50.168 --> 03:42:55.071]  You're grabbing a 12-year-old girl off a bike, a bunch of old men, I mean, you know, 40s old.
[03:42:55.071 --> 03:42:59.934]  I mean, it just makes me absolutely, just imagine my daughter's not riding bikes.
[03:42:59.934 --> 03:43:00.775]  And I'm just sorry.
[03:43:00.775 --> 03:43:02.476]  I'm just talking about it right now.
[03:43:02.476 --> 03:43:03.476]  You're not getting a trial.
[03:43:03.476 --> 03:43:04.297]  Just understand that.
[03:43:04.637 --> 03:43:17.985]  Even this perpetrator's family members that I've been able to track down recently, they say, yeah, he moved around a lot, he was kind of hiding from us all, he didn't really keep in touch, so, you know, he must... He knew to hide out.
[03:43:17.985 --> 03:43:19.125]  He knew to hide out.
[03:43:19.125 --> 03:43:29.071]  I would not be surprised if the community was up in arms about this, but nobody could fight the system when it's being rigged by the defense attorney, the prosecutor, and the judge.
[03:43:30.638 --> 03:43:31.399]  Unbelievable.
[03:43:31.399 --> 03:43:42.971]  Alright, Kathy Shelton, I want to bring Leanne McAdoo in here because she's covered all the angles of this, but looking at camera four, right over there, what is your message to the American people, or if you'd like, a message to Hillary Clinton?
[03:43:42.971 --> 03:43:44.573]  I mean, just, this is your chance.
[03:43:44.573 --> 03:43:45.654]  Millions of people are watching.
[03:43:45.654 --> 03:43:50.259]  I can imagine the things that happened to me when I was younger.
[03:43:50.259 --> 03:43:50.899]  Nothing like this.
[03:43:50.899 --> 03:43:51.800]  They scarred me for life.
[03:43:52.501 --> 03:43:55.324]  I mean, I know, I've read the statistics, I've seen it, but I haven't experienced it.
[03:43:55.324 --> 03:44:06.293]  What it can do to somebody's whole life, when they're innocent and sweet, and not ever having the first experience of somebody being loving or nice to you, just having a bunch of pigs do this to you and put you in a coma, and then her protect them.
[03:44:06.293 --> 03:44:07.194]  What would you like to say to them?
[03:44:08.944 --> 03:44:13.207]  She would do anything to get to a high spot where she wants to be.
[03:44:13.207 --> 03:44:19.752]  That includes lying under oath, cheating, stealing.
[03:44:19.752 --> 03:44:32.222]  If she was for women, she's never showed me any remorse or ever had any words to say to me since this has happened.
[03:44:32.222 --> 03:44:35.104]  She's always said, I'm a liar, I'm a liar.
[03:44:36.570 --> 03:44:48.932]  Well, evidence of hospital records and police records and even the underwear that she sent to her crime lab.
[03:44:48.932 --> 03:44:59.894]  She cut out the blood evidence and when she sent it to the crime lab, there wasn't enough to test because what she cut out was the part they needed.
[03:44:59.894 --> 03:45:03.915]  And she was kicked off the Watergate thing for falsifying evidence too.
[03:45:04.824 --> 03:45:14.933]  This is a lifelong pattern for her that began at the very beginning of her career and she's followed it up through her attitudes about setting up a private server and lying and covering up her activities that way, too.
[03:45:14.933 --> 03:45:16.214]  It's the same pattern.
[03:45:16.214 --> 03:45:17.315]  Kathy Shelton, again, continue.
[03:45:17.315 --> 03:45:19.717]  Anything else you want to tell them?
[03:45:19.717 --> 03:45:20.598]  What do you want to say to Hillary?
[03:45:20.598 --> 03:45:21.719]  Because believe me, she watches.
[03:45:21.719 --> 03:45:23.781]  What do you want to say to Hillary all these years later?
[03:45:23.781 --> 03:45:26.663]  I want to say if this was her daughter that that happened to.
[03:45:27.813 --> 03:45:30.815]  And this was her first case for her daughter.
[03:45:30.815 --> 03:45:32.696]  Would she have got hurt?
[03:45:32.696 --> 03:45:34.738]  Would she have got these men off?
[03:45:34.738 --> 03:45:36.879]  Would she have protected them from her daughter?
[03:45:36.879 --> 03:45:38.781]  I don't believe she would have.
[03:45:38.781 --> 03:45:43.704]  I believe she would have come forward then, because it would have been her daughter.
[03:45:43.704 --> 03:45:52.390]  But since it was somebody she didn't know at all, and I'm nothing to her, so, you know,
[03:45:53.351 --> 03:46:08.095]  Just like any other woman or child that she says she's for, I've heard many times that the hotline she had going when you called it, the number was supposed to call you back, and people didn't get a call back from the number.
[03:46:08.095 --> 03:46:13.776]  Well, look, I mean, it's normal to have empathy as a human being.
[03:46:13.776 --> 03:46:17.257]  Anybody's daughter is my daughter or son, but these people don't have it.
[03:46:17.257 --> 03:46:20.998]  Now, they might care about their family, but only because they see it as some extension of themselves.
[03:46:21.678 --> 03:46:28.024]  And they're so blind, and our society seems to be run by these really handicapped individuals that are sociopathic.
[03:46:28.024 --> 03:46:32.348]  Yeah, emotionally, psychologically, empathetically handicapped is a good way to put it.
[03:46:32.348 --> 03:46:34.290]  There just doesn't seem to be that.
[03:46:34.290 --> 03:46:44.020]  I think even if you had defended a guilty client in a horrific situation like this, when you choose to describe the case later like Hillary Clinton did,
[03:46:45.140 --> 03:46:53.405]  You would think, if you have any human decency in your heart, that you would be describing that case, starting out by saying, this was terrible, this was bad.
[03:46:53.405 --> 03:46:54.686]  I know defense lawyers.
[03:46:54.686 --> 03:46:55.646]  Instead, she laughs.
[03:46:55.646 --> 03:46:57.567]  She treats it lightheartedly.
[03:46:57.567 --> 03:47:00.409]  Well, we have that clip in one of Liam's magazines, and she mentioned it.
[03:47:00.409 --> 03:47:01.429]  That's a great point.
[03:47:01.429 --> 03:47:02.750]  Here's Hillary.
[03:47:02.750 --> 03:47:03.750]  This is undisputed.
[03:47:03.750 --> 03:47:05.151]  She doesn't say this tape's fake.
[03:47:05.151 --> 03:47:06.212]  Hillary admits it's real.
[03:47:06.212 --> 03:47:07.813]  Here's Hillary, you know, making jokes.
[03:47:07.813 --> 03:47:08.073]  Here it is.
[03:47:10.011 --> 03:47:12.872]  Of course he claimed that he didn't do all this stuff.
[03:47:12.872 --> 03:47:14.692]  He took a lie detector test.
[03:47:14.692 --> 03:47:17.013]  A whole bunch of polygraphs.
[03:47:17.013 --> 03:47:17.933]  Which he passed.
[03:47:17.933 --> 03:47:21.574]  Which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs.
[03:47:21.574 --> 03:47:29.576]  You know what was sad about it was that the prosecutors had evidence.
[03:47:29.576 --> 03:47:33.037]  Among which was this underneath.
[03:47:33.037 --> 03:47:33.597]  This what?
[03:47:33.597 --> 03:47:34.198]  Underneath.
[03:47:34.198 --> 03:47:36.918]  His underneath.
[03:47:36.918 --> 03:47:37.899]  Which was what?
[03:47:37.899 --> 03:47:39.359]  He sent it down to the crime lab.
[03:47:41.033 --> 03:47:43.937]  Or, Bill Beckett's reformed crime lab.
[03:47:43.937 --> 03:47:45.640]  Crime lab?
[03:47:45.640 --> 03:47:46.541]  Nope.
[03:47:46.541 --> 03:47:48.905]  Just a pair of underpants.
[03:47:48.905 --> 03:47:52.671]  Neatly cut out the part that they were going to test.
[03:47:52.671 --> 03:47:53.713]  Can't test any of them!
[03:47:54.309 --> 03:48:00.516]  Now that's Hillary bragging to journalists, she thinks to her friends, that she cut the blood out of his underwear.
[03:48:00.516 --> 03:48:01.837]  Her blood.
[03:48:01.837 --> 03:48:03.920]  And she's getting off on it.
[03:48:03.920 --> 03:48:07.644]  It's like, what freaking planet does this demon come from?
[03:48:07.644 --> 03:48:08.425]  That's the thing.
[03:48:08.425 --> 03:48:12.249]  In all the WikiLeaks, which confirms everything you said, they get off on that.
[03:48:13.206 --> 03:48:16.569]  Where they can do better doing good, they don't.
[03:48:16.569 --> 03:48:18.051]  They want to do bad.
[03:48:18.051 --> 03:48:26.659]  Well, she talked about having public positions versus private positions, and apparently, public position is, I need to be a defender of women and children.
[03:48:26.659 --> 03:48:27.700]  Private position?
[03:48:27.700 --> 03:48:30.182]  I cut the blood off his underwear.
[03:48:30.182 --> 03:48:30.603]  Proud!
[03:48:30.603 --> 03:48:32.704]  I'm proud of getting somebody off like this.
[03:48:32.704 --> 03:48:33.705]  I just want to win.
[03:48:33.705 --> 03:48:35.367]  I want to get ahead, win, and look good.
[03:48:35.367 --> 03:48:36.168]  That's who she is.
[03:48:36.468 --> 03:48:41.190]  Well, I mean, most lawyers I know won't even take your case, if they're good lawyers, unless they think you're on the right.
[03:48:41.190 --> 03:48:44.292]  But then there's these weirdos that get off on representing bad people.
[03:48:44.292 --> 03:48:45.392]  Let's go to Leanne McAdoo.
[03:48:45.392 --> 03:48:46.393]  Leanne, we're on a break.
[03:48:46.393 --> 03:48:47.633]  I want to hold you through the rest of the interview.
[03:48:47.633 --> 03:48:51.715]  And I want you to do extensive interviews after, because we flew them down here, and I know you're on the case.
[03:48:51.715 --> 03:48:59.559]  I mean, what is it like, just one more piece, but it's not just like this one case, and Hillary admitting, yeah, I covered up that he raped her, I cut the bloody underwear out.
[03:49:00.419 --> 03:49:02.379]  I mean, and giggling like a damn demon.
[03:49:02.379 --> 03:49:04.280]  It's like, it's everything.
[03:49:04.280 --> 03:49:05.260]  It's total proof.
[03:49:05.260 --> 03:49:08.241]  America and the world is being shown the proof.
[03:49:08.241 --> 03:49:08.481]  Right.
[03:49:08.481 --> 03:49:12.521]  I mean, just listening to Kathy retell her story about what happened.
[03:49:12.521 --> 03:49:18.483]  I mean, and then to know Hillary Clinton took this case voluntarily because she owed a favor to the judge.
[03:49:18.483 --> 03:49:20.983]  How, how does she sleep at night?
[03:49:20.983 --> 03:49:27.644]  And then you hear her years later laughing about it and almost so proud of how she was able to manipulate the law.
[03:49:27.644 --> 03:49:29.425]  And I think I came, I saw he died.
[03:49:29.425 --> 03:49:29.845]  Ha ha ha.
[03:49:30.505 --> 03:49:34.746]  That's what people need to understand about her is that this was kind of the foundation.
[03:49:34.746 --> 03:49:40.267]  This sets the precedent for the type of principles that Hillary Clinton has.
[03:49:40.267 --> 03:49:43.688]  Once again, here she is on the wrong side of history.
[03:49:43.688 --> 03:49:49.729]  As Candace says, you know, time and time again, she's taken the side of rapists, throwing the victims under the bus.
[03:49:49.729 --> 03:49:52.390]  And, you know, this is the tactic she uses again and again.
[03:49:52.390 --> 03:49:55.311]  Oh, well, you want to accuse my husband of sexual assault?
[03:49:55.311 --> 03:49:57.271]  Well, I'm going to accuse you of sexual assault.
[03:49:57.671 --> 03:49:59.212]  Oh, I set up an illegal server.
[03:49:59.212 --> 03:50:00.052]  Well, guess what?
[03:50:00.052 --> 03:50:01.092]  You have a server, too.
[03:50:01.092 --> 03:50:02.553]  It's connected to Russia.
[03:50:02.553 --> 03:50:04.514]  And then she says, well, I'm a champion of women.
[03:50:04.514 --> 03:50:13.538]  But behind the scenes, she's working tirelessly to get off a rapist who raped, nearly murdered a sixth grader.
[03:50:13.538 --> 03:50:15.238]  And she knew he was guilty.
[03:50:15.238 --> 03:50:16.299]  I've got a 12-year-old daughter.
[03:50:16.299 --> 03:50:20.681]  I tell you, this makes me, I'm not just saying it for audience, you know, it actually really gets to me.
[03:50:20.681 --> 03:50:21.401]  It pisses me off.
[03:50:21.681 --> 03:50:22.302]  Me too.
[03:50:22.302 --> 03:50:25.327]  I mean, this Hillary Clinton is pathological.
[03:50:25.327 --> 03:50:28.913]  Just the fact that she can... She's a pathological liar.
[03:50:28.913 --> 03:50:30.836]  Julian, you know my 12-year-old daughter.
[03:50:30.836 --> 03:50:33.199]  Can you imagine anybody's 12-year-old daughter this happening to?
[03:50:33.846 --> 03:50:34.326]  No.
[03:50:34.326 --> 03:50:36.747]  I mean, I was a 12-year-old girl.
[03:50:36.747 --> 03:50:44.069]  I know what it feels like, so I can't imagine Hillary Clinton blaming Cathy that she asked for it at 12 years old.
[03:50:44.069 --> 03:50:47.130]  As if you have any understanding of what it is you're asking for.
[03:50:47.130 --> 03:50:48.871]  And then ruining somebody's life, I would say, to a great extent.
[03:50:48.871 --> 03:50:50.612]  We'll talk about that with Cathy Shultz in the head.
[03:50:50.612 --> 03:50:53.373]  I mean, obviously, you've had a good life, but, I mean, this has got to be dramatic.
[03:50:53.373 --> 03:50:54.113]  LeeAnn, stay there.
[03:50:54.113 --> 03:50:56.894]  We'll be right back, straight ahead, InfoWars.com.
[03:51:00.129 --> 03:51:03.212]  Extendovite is more than just a heart tonic.
[03:51:03.212 --> 03:51:05.254]  Do you have any of these symptoms?
[03:51:05.254 --> 03:51:07.076]  Night cramps in the hands and feet.
[03:51:07.076 --> 03:51:09.298]  Your arms and legs often go to sleep.
[03:51:09.298 --> 03:51:12.001]  On short walks, do your legs get aches and pains?
[03:51:12.001 --> 03:51:14.163]  Is your memory worse than it used to be?
[03:51:14.163 --> 03:51:16.025]  Ankles that swell late in the day.
[03:51:16.025 --> 03:51:17.767]  Has your blood pressure increased lately?
[03:51:18.047 --> 03:51:24.631]  If you answered yes to even one of these questions, you may have early warning signs of arterial blockages.
[03:51:24.631 --> 03:51:28.053]  Your body is saying that it is time to take Xtendivite.
[03:51:28.053 --> 03:51:30.335]  These are not the normal signs of aging.
[03:51:30.335 --> 03:51:33.657]  They are the warning signs that accompany blocked arteries.
[03:51:33.657 --> 03:51:35.598]  Get your Xtendivite today!

[03:52:59.252 --> 03:53:01.834]  I want to tell you about a brand new off-the-grid product.
[03:53:01.834 --> 03:53:03.916]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[03:53:03.916 --> 03:53:09.460]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110 appliances at your house.
[03:53:09.460 --> 03:53:12.022]  Like small refrigerators to keep your food from spoiling.
[03:53:12.022 --> 03:53:14.905]  The best part though, you can take it with you.
[03:53:14.905 --> 03:53:15.605]  It's mobile.
[03:53:15.605 --> 03:53:20.149]  To jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[03:53:20.569 --> 03:53:24.192]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity.
[03:53:24.192 --> 03:53:27.495]  Basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[03:53:27.495 --> 03:53:28.496]  A true innovation.
[03:53:28.496 --> 03:53:30.518]  I have never seen anything like this.
[03:53:30.518 --> 03:53:32.180]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[03:53:32.180 --> 03:53:34.582]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[03:53:34.582 --> 03:53:38.666]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.
[03:53:38.666 --> 03:53:40.707]  Go to privatepowergrid.com.
[03:53:40.707 --> 03:53:42.689]  That's privatepowergrid.com.

[03:54:11.332 --> 03:54:15.735]  Kathy Shelton broke down during the break and has been sobbing here.
[03:54:15.735 --> 03:54:18.797]  And she's been trying to compose herself.
[03:54:18.797 --> 03:54:24.762]  I know it's hard for her to talk about this, but this is the real humanity of what Hillary Clinton has done to people.
[03:54:24.762 --> 03:54:33.188]  And I just can't imagine, you know, it's one thing for bad things to happen, but I'm told if justice is done sometimes, that provides some form of relief.
[03:54:34.234 --> 03:54:41.233]  Uh, why when you heard Leigh-Anne talking, or I guess I was talking about what happens to young girls, how it changes their lives, you began to break down as we went to break.
[03:54:41.233 --> 03:54:42.036]  Why did you break down?
[03:54:43.104 --> 03:54:51.769]  Because of all the things I read about Hillary, everything, books, movies, she's got me in it.
[03:54:51.769 --> 03:54:54.511]  And it's like, it's funny, it's her first case.
[03:54:54.511 --> 03:54:56.792]  It's like it's funny it happened to me.
[03:54:56.792 --> 03:54:58.994]  It don't mean no remorse to her or nothing.
[03:54:58.994 --> 03:55:02.876]  And she's supposed to be for women and children.
[03:55:02.876 --> 03:55:05.698]  But this is funny, I won my first case.
[03:55:05.698 --> 03:55:12.302]  And it's all funny and all the stuff she's written.
[03:55:14.602 --> 03:55:15.963]  That is rubbing it is.
[03:55:15.963 --> 03:55:17.224]  The cackling.
[03:55:17.224 --> 03:55:18.646]  She makes a failed state in Libya.
[03:55:18.646 --> 03:55:21.989]  They killed tens of thousands, almost 100,000 people.
[03:55:21.989 --> 03:55:27.014]  She starts and then she makes jokes about it.
[03:55:27.014 --> 03:55:29.256]  But even her own staff admit in the WikiLeaks they hate her.
[03:55:29.256 --> 03:55:30.257]  They can't stand her.
[03:55:30.257 --> 03:55:33.159]  They say she has horrible judgment.
[03:55:33.159 --> 03:55:34.481]  They call her a demon basically.
[03:55:36.589 --> 03:55:42.393]  And somebody who just comes off as a mediocre, unlikable candidate and person.
[03:55:42.393 --> 03:55:45.195]  She doesn't have that humanity.
[03:55:45.195 --> 03:55:50.838]  But there are corporate interests that want to put her in because she'll do the things nobody else will.
[03:55:50.838 --> 03:55:51.859]  Kathy, anything else you'd like to add?
[03:55:59.786 --> 03:56:00.487]  I went blank.
[03:56:00.487 --> 03:56:01.107]  I'm sorry.
[03:56:01.107 --> 03:56:01.787]  No, it's okay.
[03:56:01.787 --> 03:56:02.308]  It's okay.
[03:56:02.308 --> 03:56:08.191]  I just... Me getting torn down a little bit has got me kind of going blank, but... No, I understand.
[03:56:08.191 --> 03:56:09.232]  Well, I mean, what made you so upset?
[03:56:09.232 --> 03:56:16.436]  She's totally made me look... She's totally made me look like I'm a liar and that I've asked for this.
[03:56:16.436 --> 03:56:22.740]  Trust me, if I could turn all this around, I would rather it not happen.
[03:56:24.230 --> 03:56:35.897]  And me not having to go through all this, but actually, right now, I'm actually kind of being re-dramatized again, having to get up and tell all this, but you know what?
[03:56:35.897 --> 03:56:41.521]  Somebody's got to stand up and tell the truth, because she sure ain't.
[03:56:41.521 --> 03:56:43.782]  She's just going to make it, you know?
[03:56:43.782 --> 03:56:51.247]  Oh, well, that was my first case I got off, so hey, it looks good.
[03:56:51.247 --> 03:56:52.668]  I don't care what happened to her.
[03:56:53.854 --> 03:56:55.215]  Well, you're protecting other people.
[03:56:55.215 --> 03:56:57.236]  You're protecting other people.
[03:56:57.236 --> 03:56:59.878]  You've transcended her a thousand times.
[03:56:59.878 --> 03:57:00.878]  You're helping other people.
[03:57:00.878 --> 03:57:02.479]  And you're a human and she's not.
[03:57:02.479 --> 03:57:03.460]  Let's just be honest.
[03:57:03.460 --> 03:57:03.800]  Leanne?
[03:57:03.800 --> 03:57:06.302]  I want to say one more thing.
[03:57:06.302 --> 03:57:09.263]  She's also said that I came from the other side of the tracks.
[03:57:09.263 --> 03:57:10.824]  I don't know what that's supposed to mean.
[03:57:10.824 --> 03:57:13.866]  Oh, she hates anybody that's poor or a minority.
[03:57:13.866 --> 03:57:15.147]  She really hates poor people.
[03:57:15.147 --> 03:57:16.728]  And then she claims she's this big champion.
[03:57:17.659 --> 03:57:18.160]  What do you think?
[03:57:18.160 --> 03:57:20.723]  We're going to break it out with Lee and everybody and extend this a little bit into Gerald Solendzik.
[03:57:20.723 --> 03:57:21.924]  This is so important.
[03:57:21.924 --> 03:57:26.730]  What did you think of meeting with Trump, him having a press conference, him bringing you there?
[03:57:26.730 --> 03:57:29.253]  Hillary's never showed no remorse.
[03:57:29.253 --> 03:57:35.180]  The first time I met Donald Trump, he hugged me and he said, I am so sorry for what happened to you.
[03:57:36.613 --> 03:57:42.759]  And Hillary has never once shown me any remorse of any kind.
[03:57:42.759 --> 03:57:45.342]  It's like she laughs, and she doesn't care.
[03:57:45.342 --> 03:57:47.424]  Well, for a fact, Trump loves America.
[03:57:47.424 --> 03:57:50.247]  He's not perfect, but he hates seeing us get screwed over.
[03:57:50.247 --> 03:57:52.068]  That's why the whole corrupt leader is against him.
[03:57:52.068 --> 03:57:57.274]  How obvious is it that the whole bad group we don't like is against this person?
[03:57:57.274 --> 03:57:58.355]  I mean, it's a no-brainer.
[03:57:59.750 --> 03:58:09.710]  Oh, I think, yeah, not even a comparison and anything that Trump has been accused of saying does not compare to what Hillary Clinton has chose to do for 40 years of her career.
[03:58:11.121 --> 03:58:12.282]  We're going to come back in 70 seconds.
[03:58:12.282 --> 03:58:13.082]  I want Leigh-Anne to chime in.
[03:58:13.082 --> 03:58:14.524]  I saw Leigh-Anne got some tears in her eyes.
[03:58:14.524 --> 03:58:15.965]  My sister works here.
[03:58:15.965 --> 03:58:17.226]  She takes photos.
[03:58:17.226 --> 03:58:17.886]  Does a great job.
[03:58:17.886 --> 03:58:20.328]  Does editing for us.
[03:58:20.328 --> 03:58:22.449]  Because they admit he pled to this.
[03:58:22.449 --> 03:58:23.030]  This went on.
[03:58:23.030 --> 03:58:23.850]  This happened.
[03:58:23.850 --> 03:58:25.692]  She brags and tells people.
[03:58:25.692 --> 03:58:26.532]  We played the clip earlier.
[03:58:26.532 --> 03:58:29.314]  I don't know if it came across on AM radio, but it comes on on FM.
[03:58:29.314 --> 03:58:33.958]  I mean, she just makes fun of how she got him off and covered up the blood on his underwear when he raped this girl.
[03:58:33.958 --> 03:58:35.659]  I mean, Hillary Clinton is a demon.
[03:58:35.659 --> 03:58:35.979]  Excuse me.
[03:58:35.979 --> 03:58:36.640]  That's what she is.
