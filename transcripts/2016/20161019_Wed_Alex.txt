[00:00:13.877 --> 00:00:41.105]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[00:00:42.527 --> 00:00:44.591]  You're listening to Alex Jones!
[00:01:07.384 --> 00:01:21.595]  As Americans turn the corner towards the final presidential debate on Wednesday, the election circus has devolved into personal attacks and character assassination rather than any real focus on the issues plaguing the United States.
[00:01:22.075 --> 00:01:26.479]  The media outlets did not even attempt to confirm the most basic facts.
[00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:35.784]  Because even a simple investigation would have shown that these were nothing more than false smears.
[00:01:36.344 --> 00:01:42.707]  Facing an avalanche of new accusations from women who are coming forward to claim he kissed and fondled them.
[00:01:43.328 --> 00:01:50.472]  Six women are going public today with stories that echo what Trump himself said in that notorious hot mic video.
[00:01:50.792 --> 00:01:52.913]  He called this woman Miss Piggy.
[00:01:53.293 --> 00:01:54.914]  Her name is Alicia- Where did you find this?
[00:01:55.034 --> 00:01:55.734]  Machado.
[00:01:55.954 --> 00:01:58.556]  Trump spoke out about those claims on Fox News.
[00:01:58.776 --> 00:02:00.297]  And she was the worst we ever had.
[00:02:00.777 --> 00:02:02.118]  The worst, the absolute worst.
[00:02:02.338 --> 00:02:04.939]  And, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight.
[00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:07.920]  And it was, it was a real problem.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:22.988]  Regardless of the fact that Obama's unconstitutional open border policy is quietly responsible for killing as many as 7,500 Americans every year, 20 on average per day, due to the hordes of illegal drivers flooding the roads while Obama
[00:02:23.168 --> 00:02:23.649]  I don't know.
[00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:57.124]  Regardless of the fact that Obama and Hillary's new Cold War rhetoric, amplified by a suicidal mainstream media, has obliterated any shred of integrity 6% of Americans still think cable-fed propaganda media has, after polls revealed America is almost completely done with the mainstream media.
[00:02:57.364 --> 00:03:10.349]  Mainstream media's stranglehold of propaganda desperation and damage was palpable on the campaign trail as if its demise was what truly concerns Americans, but obviously has panicked the ruling elite.
[00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.489]  He doesn't have the temperament.
[00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:13.530]  He doesn't have the knowledge.
[00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:23.093]  He doesn't seem to have the interest in acquiring the knowledge or the basic honesty that a president needs to have.
[00:03:23.713 --> 00:03:25.574]  And that was true before we heard him.
[00:03:26.733 --> 00:03:29.676]  Talking about how he treats women.
[00:03:31.017 --> 00:03:32.979]  This is not something that we can ignore.
[00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:41.746]  It's not something we can just sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election season.
[00:03:41.766 --> 00:03:44.649]  Because this was not just a lewd conversation.
[00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.431]  This wasn't just locker room banter.
[00:03:47.571 --> 00:03:50.254]  This was a powerful individual.
[00:03:50.994 --> 00:03:52.256]  She's so sad.
[00:03:52.416 --> 00:03:53.438]  She cares so much.
[00:03:53.498 --> 00:03:56.181]  You're raping eight-year-old girls to death like ISIS does?
[00:03:56.221 --> 00:03:57.043]  Your husband supports?
[00:04:07.116 --> 00:04:08.277]  She made a powerful speech.
[00:04:08.317 --> 00:04:11.119]  They said it was the greatest speech of the decade, I think.
[00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:19.745]  She's speaking to everyone out there who respects women and saying, put your politics aside for a second and be able to cause something that's indefensible, indefensible enough for the kids.
[00:04:19.786 --> 00:04:22.327]  Put your politics aside for a second.
[00:04:24.429 --> 00:04:25.649]  And Washington D.C.
[00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:26.050]  knows it.
[00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:39.753]  Six in ten Americans are getting their news from social media alone, while one in five households has dropped cable's buffet of news propaganda to research digital options and think for themselves.
[00:04:40.034 --> 00:04:48.976]  Mainstream media, with its hubris as shallow and obvious as the corporate government criminals it represents, appears to be breathing its last gasp.
[00:04:49.296 --> 00:04:51.277]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com.
[00:04:52.197 --> 00:04:54.280]  Absolutely, and here is the bottom line.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.425]  Even if Trump doesn't get elected, which I think he will, they may try to steal it.
[00:04:58.847 --> 00:04:59.748]  Resistance is victory.
[00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:01.951]  We're exposing their whole criminal operation.
[00:05:02.231 --> 00:05:07.959]  This is really a referendum on mainstream media, and they've totally shown their hand and destroyed themselves, and the ratings show that.
[00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.420]  They're over.
[00:05:10.225 --> 00:05:19.870]  There's an article up on our website on Infowars.com written by Clifford Cunningham that addresses one anonymous Navy official telling Alaskans prepare for war.
[00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.192]  This official suggests that Russia is preparing an invasion in response to U.S.
[00:05:24.232 --> 00:05:24.652]  strikes.
[00:05:24.772 --> 00:05:30.815]  He's unnamed, but he's warned the residents of Alaska to prepare for an invasion in the event of war between the U.S.
[00:05:30.855 --> 00:05:31.396]  and Russia.
[00:05:31.476 --> 00:05:32.456]  This is what he said.
[00:05:32.496 --> 00:05:35.998]  We're on the verge of being invaded from Alaska all the way down into
[00:05:35.998 --> 00:05:36.318]  We're good.
[00:05:53.865 --> 00:06:03.369]  He goes on to say our feeling in the Navy was that Obama has turned Alaska into a defenseless area that will serve as a forward base of operations when World War III begins.
[00:06:03.609 --> 00:06:05.670]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:12.732]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:13.032 --> 00:06:20.318]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.

[00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:49.092]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today, with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[00:06:49.412 --> 00:06:53.614]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.

[00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:02.079]  That means it's clean.
[00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:03.480]  That means it's pure.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.362]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[00:07:44.817 --> 00:07:45.998]  Stainless steel construction.

[00:08:17.208 --> 00:08:22.351]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:08:41.221 --> 00:08:45.905]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're now only 19 days out from the midterm election.
[00:08:45.965 --> 00:08:47.146]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:47.446 --> 00:08:49.067]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:08:49.107 --> 00:08:55.152]  We have another jam-packed, incredibly important transmission lined up for you today.
[00:08:55.872 --> 00:09:02.537]  Watching Fox, watching CNN, watching MSNBC now is almost like watching the same channels.
[00:09:03.598 --> 00:09:06.921]  The way they spin and deceive is simply incredible.
[00:09:07.864 --> 00:09:23.713]  I watched two different Fox shows this morning while I was working out, and they all agreed there's really no election fraud going on, and it's very rare, and there's very little voter fraud, and Donald Trump really shouldn't be talking about this.
[00:09:25.033 --> 00:09:31.877]  After President Obama came out and attacked him yesterday while speaking with the Italian president from the Rose Garden.
[00:09:33.038 --> 00:09:35.059]  And I'm sitting there thinking, what planet are we on?
[00:09:36.274 --> 00:09:59.331]  Because we've got Scott Foval, the national coordinator under Robert Cramer, who goes to the White House 200 plus times in the last few years, and is running the national program funded by Soros and MoveOn and others, to go around and have people illegally vote.
[00:09:59.351 --> 00:10:00.772]  I mean, they're on video saying.
[00:10:02.284 --> 00:10:20.539]  And having them bust around the polling station after polling station in battleground states from Pennsylvania to Ohio to Florida to New York, who they see as a battleground because they know how well Trump's really doing, cussing and bragging and acting like people right out of a cops and robbers movie.
[00:10:24.264 --> 00:10:26.244]  And of course, this morning it was 200 plus times.
[00:10:26.284 --> 00:10:29.185]  Now the actual number's been confirmed 340 times.
[00:10:29.205 --> 00:10:30.305]  They have to dig through the records.
[00:10:30.325 --> 00:10:31.145]  Breitbart's done that.
[00:10:31.945 --> 00:10:50.049]  So... So we've got the White House... We've got the White House knee-deep in all of this.
[00:10:53.697 --> 00:10:54.217]  Publicly!
[00:10:55.718 --> 00:11:07.764]  And you've got the head of the New York Election Commission, a Democrat, saying the candidates bust their people around, the Democrats run and are stealing elections, and he thinks it's wrong, but there's nothing he can do about it.
[00:11:08.624 --> 00:11:19.109]  Then we have Scott Fovill, the underling of Mr. Kramer, Robert Kramer, on video, saying
[00:11:22.233 --> 00:11:27.195]  That they are stealing elections, and the best part is, he goes, there's nothing they can do about it.
[00:11:27.596 --> 00:11:35.459]  We don't even care if reporters catch the fraud, because the media is not going to pick it up, and there's nothing they can do, and nobody's going to prosecute us.
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:50.627]  Folks, Democrats are so criminal in this country now, that in California, Illinois, and six or seven other states, in the last year, they tried, and in some cases passed, laws
[00:11:52.159 --> 00:11:59.265]  That were then not implemented, because they were so illegal at the federal level, to allow illegal aliens to vote.
[00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:04.870]  It actually says, you can land on a plane, and if it's on election day, you can vote.
[00:12:05.451 --> 00:12:09.294]  You can come in on a visa, or come in illegally, you're not a citizen, you can vote.
[00:12:10.115 --> 00:12:11.196]  Anybody can just Google that.
[00:12:11.597 --> 00:12:16.221]  Democrats introduce legislation to allow undocumented to work, will be the headline.
[00:12:17.029 --> 00:12:24.976]  Or, Illinois House passes unanimously a bill to allow migrants to vote.
[00:12:25.237 --> 00:12:26.478]  I mean, this is crazy!
[00:12:28.199 --> 00:12:35.606]  Because then they get up on TV, and Obama says that, what's the exact quote?
[00:12:35.626 --> 00:12:36.387]  I have the clip here.
[00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.572]  To Trump, stop whining!
[00:12:43.669 --> 00:12:44.589]  About a rigged election.
[00:12:44.849 --> 00:12:48.051]  Now remember, about three months ago I come out and I say they're going to try to steal the election.
[00:12:48.411 --> 00:12:50.611]  They tried to steal it from Trump.
[00:12:50.671 --> 00:12:51.732]  He stood up and said no.
[00:12:52.632 --> 00:12:55.833]  They did steal it from Bernie Sanders, that's been certified by Stanford University and others.
[00:12:56.313 --> 00:13:02.275]  You can just look on record that they had superdelegates in 11 states circumvent the actual popular vote.
[00:13:03.356 --> 00:13:04.316]  So he won big time.
[00:13:05.677 --> 00:13:12.439]  And so if they've already stole it, and if Hillary's already been caught engaged in so much crime, and as the former high-level Secret Service agent said two days ago on air,
[00:13:13.971 --> 00:13:18.152]  Hillary already stole the nomination, so she's already stolen the election.
[00:13:19.593 --> 00:13:20.533]  She will go for broke.
[00:13:21.833 --> 00:13:33.076]  So we live in a country where we have HD video of the head of New York elections saying it's total fraud, they're stealing elections, it's horrible, I wish we could stop it.
[00:13:34.657 --> 00:13:37.017]  But the Democrats won't stop it, and he's a Democrat.
[00:13:38.098 --> 00:13:39.678]  But he obviously is not a bad person.
[00:13:43.154 --> 00:13:56.880]  And then you've got the number one organization for organizing voting in the Democratic Party since Acorn got sunk by James O'Keefe, the mighty James O'Keefe.
[00:14:00.141 --> 00:14:01.622]  And no one is covering.
[00:14:03.342 --> 00:14:07.464]  That's why I was really watching Fox News this morning, because there was almost no mention of it.
[00:14:07.644 --> 00:14:11.626]  And then they had Juan Williams on with Hemmer.
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:18.483]  And Juan Williams was on there, and he was like, oh, it's no big deal.
[00:14:19.504 --> 00:14:21.886]  That James O'Keefe thing's nothing.
[00:14:22.327 --> 00:14:22.887]  That's nothing.
[00:14:23.167 --> 00:14:26.571]  So I tune over to CNN, and we've actually got a similar clip.
[00:14:26.591 --> 00:14:29.253]  I guess that's the talking point, but it's a different show than what I saw.
[00:14:29.273 --> 00:14:31.195]  They're like, James O'Keefe!
[00:14:31.976 --> 00:14:33.557]  We're not talking about that to the guest.
[00:14:33.857 --> 00:14:35.399]  That man's a criminal!
[00:14:35.419 --> 00:14:38.342]  And the other host goes, yeah, a criminal!
[00:14:39.349 --> 00:14:41.291]  He's a convicted criminal.
[00:14:41.611 --> 00:14:46.775]  They didn't tell you it was for basically trespassing in a congresswoman's office.
[00:14:46.855 --> 00:14:50.698]  Oh my God, he walked into the office and said, hi, I'm here to fix the telephones.
[00:14:51.038 --> 00:14:53.681]  Because they turned the telephones off for days.
[00:14:55.222 --> 00:14:55.682]  Remember that?
[00:14:56.022 --> 00:14:59.924]  Because they didn't want to take false, so he walked in to show they're a bunch of liars.
[00:15:00.204 --> 00:15:01.244]  That's what a journalist does.
[00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:03.805]  They turned that around, that he was trespassing.
[00:15:04.125 --> 00:15:04.845]  Oh my gosh.
[00:15:05.306 --> 00:15:12.408]  Alex, you know, trespassing, again, you're being pretty modest there, but it was actually a less degree of a crime than that.
[00:15:12.888 --> 00:15:16.369]  It was entering a government building on false pretenses.
[00:15:16.409 --> 00:15:19.250]  Sure, I was going from memory, but that's how the media spun it, so exactly.
[00:15:19.631 --> 00:15:23.092]  He went in a public building as an investigative journalist,
[00:15:23.652 --> 00:15:26.314]  I think there was a law entering a building on false pretences.
[00:15:26.354 --> 00:15:28.676]  I think they mean then that triggers a trespassing charge.
[00:15:28.976 --> 00:15:35.782]  Oh, they had to really try and find something to hit him with because what he was doing was actually legal by
[00:15:39.144 --> 00:15:41.085]  Pretty much every stretch of the imagination.
[00:15:41.105 --> 00:15:44.367]  The guy is an absolute American hero.
[00:15:44.887 --> 00:15:48.029]  He is an absolute American hero.
[00:15:48.249 --> 00:15:49.730]  He is the model of journalism.
[00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:54.312]  What he does should be taught in every journalism school in the world.
[00:15:54.572 --> 00:16:05.538]  Instead, a bunch of false journalists, political frauds, get up on Fox and CNN and everywhere and call him a criminal and then don't even tell their viewers
[00:16:06.138 --> 00:16:07.999]  What he's supposedly a criminal for.
[00:16:08.299 --> 00:16:11.000]  This is like saying he has a freaking speeding ticket.
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:11.860]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:16:14.001 --> 00:16:14.641]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:16.001 --> 00:16:18.642]  Basically, he entered the building on false pretenses.
[00:16:18.682 --> 00:16:20.943]  And like you said, it was Mary Landrieu's office.
[00:16:21.243 --> 00:16:26.705]  And she was hiding from many of her constituents saying she was claiming that her phone system didn't work.
[00:16:27.125 --> 00:16:34.888]  And so his whole gist there was he entered with a hard hat and kind of like a construction vest.
[00:16:35.428 --> 00:16:44.934]  And his intent was to go in and basically say, hey, I'm here to fix the broken phones, trying to catch someone, one of our staffers, saying there is no problem with the phones.
[00:16:45.414 --> 00:16:47.856]  And at that point he would have, you know, busted her out.
[00:16:48.296 --> 00:16:58.983]  But what happened was one of his partners in the video sting went into it and he was a little green and didn't use the right language.
[00:16:59.183 --> 00:17:00.123]  It seemed suspicious.
[00:17:00.384 --> 00:17:00.584]  Sure.
[00:17:00.664 --> 00:17:03.826]  And then he was actually able to make an escape, but then was
[00:17:04.386 --> 00:17:09.907]  Sure, I mean, I covered it a few years ago, it was like three or four years ago back when it happened, and by the way, I love it, Matt, when you pop in on the show, but we are TV.
[00:17:10.187 --> 00:17:18.309]  You guys are gonna pop in, you gotta aim a camera at you, so we're not just looking at me while you're talking, but you're making some really, really great points there to remind people, and that's why I raised it.
[00:17:18.629 --> 00:17:20.389]  It's the way they deceive their viewers.
[00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.090]  Oh, don't listen to James O'Keefe!
[00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:23.410]  He's a criminal!
[00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:24.910]  He's a convicted criminal!
[00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:28.291]  No, he's an investigative journalist that snuck in there to show a lie.
[00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:30.172]  You know, I snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[00:17:30.612 --> 00:17:32.232]  I've snuck into other facilities.
[00:17:32.492 --> 00:17:33.232]  to expose things.
[00:17:33.392 --> 00:17:37.973]  You're supposed to get a medal for that when you expose corruption, not get charged.
[00:17:37.993 --> 00:17:42.074]  And they tried to charge you with felonies, wiretapping and stuff, but that fell through.
[00:17:42.094 --> 00:17:44.115]  But that's an absolutely great point, Matt.
[00:17:44.135 --> 00:17:45.935]  In fact, we're going to get to some of these clips here in a moment.
[00:17:45.955 --> 00:17:48.396]  Feel free to pop back in with those whenever you'd like.
[00:17:48.416 --> 00:17:49.316]  But any other points?
[00:17:50.817 --> 00:17:51.917]  No, no, you got it.
[00:17:53.277 --> 00:17:55.678]  What I'm getting at is it's so frustrating.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:07.246]  To see this level of deception and to see somebody who has produced more game-changing, on-the-ground investigative reports than anybody in history I know of.
[00:18:07.787 --> 00:18:18.433]  The famous gumshoes, the famous Mickey Spillanes, and the famous folks that, you know, brought down corrupt mayors and corrupt mafia organizations are nothing compared to this guy.
[00:18:18.893 --> 00:18:22.956]  His laundry list of devastation against tyrants is beautiful.
[00:18:23.956 --> 00:18:31.118]  I mean, we probably wouldn't even be in the game right now if it wasn't for people like James O'Keefe and Matt Drudge, and quite frankly, myself.
[00:18:31.559 --> 00:18:33.279]  And I don't say that so I get credit either.
[00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:37.441]  But this operation, our crew, the audience, that is in full force.
[00:18:37.981 --> 00:18:45.003]  But when you talk about a one-man wrecking crew with his organization he has now, but if it wasn't for his push, we would be in even worse trouble.
[00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:49.545]  And he just brings out bombshell after bombshell, and to see the mainstream media
[00:18:50.581 --> 00:18:51.102]  Unified.
[00:18:51.402 --> 00:18:55.127]  Despite the fact that his reports now have tens of millions of views the last two days.
[00:18:57.129 --> 00:19:01.835]  And there's no coverage unless somebody mentions it as a guest and they shut him down.
[00:19:01.875 --> 00:19:04.258]  They go, there's no evidence of election fraud.
[00:19:04.638 --> 00:19:06.881]  Trump's crazy and we don't talk about O'Keefe.
[00:19:07.201 --> 00:19:08.082]  He's a criminal.
[00:19:09.022 --> 00:19:09.863]  We're good to go.
[00:19:25.962 --> 00:19:33.570]  But they kind of manipulated him, I'm going to skip this break, because I've talked to him on and off air, into them putting the whole thing out like Planned Parenthood did.
[00:19:34.571 --> 00:19:35.471]  The folks that exposed that.
[00:19:35.872 --> 00:19:37.533]  Oh, you're saying we selectively edit?
[00:19:37.754 --> 00:19:39.035]  Here, here's three hours.
[00:19:39.896 --> 00:19:40.777]  Totally unedited.
[00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:45.728]  You've got to edit it when you're undercover and you've got five, six, seven hours of stuff.
[00:19:46.008 --> 00:19:52.472]  If the jury wants to see the full video, they can go at night and sit in the jury box and watch the full ten hours.
[00:19:53.112 --> 00:19:59.235]  You don't have time in a trial, this is a public trial, we're going to show you the clips, the jury decides if they look edited, okay?
[00:19:59.495 --> 00:20:00.696]  And it's not edited.
[00:20:01.216 --> 00:20:04.738]  It's for brevity, the clips of the meat and potatoes.
[00:20:06.359 --> 00:20:08.460]  Speaking of the devil, we're going to play some of those.
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.762]  Before the Clintons left their government.
[00:20:31.883 --> 00:20:36.788]  And again, we have Obama saying they're federalizing the elections to stop the Russians.
[00:20:37.188 --> 00:20:43.575]  That's the crazy conspiracy theory we know about the Democratic Party and their election fraud using voter fraud at the grassroots.
[00:20:43.635 --> 00:20:45.277]  They are famous for it.
[00:20:46.057 --> 00:20:46.978]  World famous!
[00:20:48.004 --> 00:20:54.608]  So again, this is just like saying, it's ridiculous, Obamacare is free, and you can keep your doctor, and there's no penalty.
[00:20:54.868 --> 00:20:55.508]  It's a lie.
[00:20:55.808 --> 00:20:57.369]  It's a right-wing conspiracy theory.
[00:20:57.609 --> 00:21:01.451]  I can't do a good Obama accent, but I'm quoting Obama right now.
[00:21:01.972 --> 00:21:05.154]  Listen, it's a right-wing conspiracy theory, alright?
[00:21:05.414 --> 00:21:06.714]  They don't want you to get a better deal.
[00:21:07.175 --> 00:21:07.715]  This is it.
[00:21:08.235 --> 00:21:08.776]  Don't believe them.
[00:21:09.176 --> 00:21:10.416]  You like your doctor, you can keep it.
[00:21:10.897 --> 00:21:12.237]  It's gonna be free for most of you.
[00:21:12.498 --> 00:21:16.140]  Gonna reduce it for others down to the price of a phone bill or cable bill, alright?
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.040]  Don't listen to these people.
[00:21:19.921 --> 00:21:20.741]  There's no penalties.
[00:21:21.301 --> 00:21:21.801]  Joe Biden.
[00:21:23.182 --> 00:21:24.622]  Barack Obama didn't come in after your guns.
[00:21:25.082 --> 00:21:27.523]  Not your rifle, your shotgun, your handgun, your semi-auto, none of it.
[00:21:27.743 --> 00:21:31.404]  Let me tell you, he comes after my Beretta, it's semi-auto, he's gonna have a problem.
[00:21:32.304 --> 00:21:33.284]  That's a quote, Joe Biden.
[00:21:34.405 --> 00:21:35.385]  Did they come after your guns?
[00:21:35.465 --> 00:21:37.385]  You damn well better know they did.
[00:21:37.705 --> 00:21:39.826]  And the new WikiLeaks show, they're coming with executive orders.
[00:21:40.246 --> 00:21:43.067]  So what we're facing is a wall of lies.
[00:21:44.741 --> 00:21:50.864]  And I know you know this, but we've got to get the word out to people that are still in the bubble that only watch mainstream TV and explain to them, you're a buffoon!
[00:21:52.345 --> 00:21:53.826]  You got conned by Obamacare.
[00:21:54.426 --> 00:21:57.648]  You got conned by NAFTA and all this other stuff that he's against.
[00:21:57.968 --> 00:21:58.928]  He wants term limits.
[00:21:59.729 --> 00:22:01.229]  He wants bans on lobbying.
[00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:02.710]  I mean, they are freaking out.
[00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.931]  No wonder the political power structure is scared.
[00:22:05.692 --> 00:22:09.654]  Because their whole system is in trouble as he prepares to try to drain the swamp.
[00:22:10.594 --> 00:22:11.054]  Here's another one.
[00:22:11.134 --> 00:22:12.035]  Election expert.
[00:22:13.831 --> 00:22:14.732]  This is Fox News.
[00:22:15.012 --> 00:22:18.996]  We now have 4 million ineligible and dead voters on American voter rolls.
[00:22:19.036 --> 00:22:20.157]  That's admitted, it's 4 million.
[00:22:20.378 --> 00:22:21.138]  It's more than 4 million.
[00:22:21.699 --> 00:22:23.180]  And they are voting, voting, voting.
[00:22:23.501 --> 00:22:26.344]  They have people voting up to 10 times a day.
[00:22:27.651 --> 00:22:34.592]  In early voting right now, ladies and gentlemen, around the country, they've got them getting ready to vote more than 10 times apiece in battleground states.
[00:22:34.652 --> 00:22:36.493]  This is unbelievable.
[00:22:36.713 --> 00:22:37.813]  And you know why they're so scared?
[00:22:37.833 --> 00:22:44.735]  And they have Obama out there saying, how dare you say that Trump's going to have people outside the polls looking for people voting more than once?
[00:22:45.195 --> 00:22:45.875]  How dare you?
[00:22:45.895 --> 00:22:47.215]  That's voter intimidation.
[00:22:48.455 --> 00:22:49.796]  Oh, but there's no election fraud.
[00:22:49.856 --> 00:22:52.436]  But if we go try to watch, we're trying to intimidate people.
[00:22:52.456 --> 00:22:53.696]  You know what's going to happen in battleground states?
[00:22:53.997 --> 00:22:54.877]  Folks are going to go vote.
[00:22:54.897 --> 00:22:55.677]  They're going to sit in their car.
[00:22:56.854 --> 00:23:02.295]  They're going to see buses pull up, or they're going to see vans pull up, or they're going to see cars pull up with a bunch of people getting out of them.
[00:23:03.796 --> 00:23:05.976]  Black, white, you name it, Hispanic, but generally poor.
[00:23:05.996 --> 00:23:07.077]  A lot of times drunk.
[00:23:07.157 --> 00:23:09.677]  They admittedly give them alcohol, pay them, you name it.
[00:23:11.118 --> 00:23:15.579]  And then you follow them to the next polling place, you go with a hidden camera, you got them.
[00:23:16.259 --> 00:23:16.859]  You got them.
[00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:23.834]  Be careful about election laws because they'll commit crimes and do this right in front of you and then try to charge you with disrupting an election or whatever.
[00:23:23.874 --> 00:23:29.858]  But look, we're going to bring these tyrants down and they're scared because they know that Trump's organizing it.
[00:23:30.239 --> 00:23:31.700]  We're helping people organize it.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:32.680]  You're taking action.
[00:23:34.382 --> 00:23:39.706]  Folks, you go to a popular polling place in a battleground state, you're going to see election fraud.
[00:23:41.147 --> 00:23:43.669]  It's very hard to catch them in the absentee stuff.
[00:23:43.929 --> 00:23:45.050]  That's where they really load it.
[00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:45.891]  They front load it.
[00:23:46.923 --> 00:23:50.626]  But the big cheating, because this is a landslide for Trump, 10-15 points ahead.
[00:23:51.486 --> 00:23:53.568]  Newt Gingrich said that two days ago, he's absolutely right.
[00:23:53.588 --> 00:23:54.529]  That's what I've been telling you.
[00:23:54.889 --> 00:23:57.150]  Internal polls, that's why he knows it's rigged.
[00:23:57.531 --> 00:23:59.592]  Because Trump's doing real internal polling.
[00:24:00.873 --> 00:24:07.018]  And he knows that he's 5-15 points, depending where he's at, ahead of Hillary, and then he sees the news saying he's behind.
[00:24:07.438 --> 00:24:09.660]  Or he's in a dead heat with her.
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.141]  There's fraud going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:12.742 --> 00:24:13.622]  And you know that.
[00:24:15.489 --> 00:24:17.896]  We have to get the word out on those subjects now.
[00:24:19.827 --> 00:24:20.727]  I should have got to this yesterday.
[00:24:20.767 --> 00:24:21.267]  I mentioned it.
[00:24:21.307 --> 00:24:22.288]  We posted on Infowars.
[00:24:22.328 --> 00:24:25.568]  We wrote stories about it, actually, on Monday when it first started breaking.
[00:24:26.489 --> 00:24:29.569]  O'Keefe sent us the big data dump while he did drugs and everybody else at the same time.
[00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:31.230]  We reported on it Monday.
[00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:32.250]  We covered it Tuesday.
[00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:33.230]  Our reporters covered it.
[00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:40.252]  But I haven't gotten into this enough because, quite frankly, I thought that this would actually break through and get on mainstream networks.
[00:24:40.392 --> 00:24:40.812]  It hasn't.
[00:24:41.492 --> 00:24:47.874]  And O'Keefe's written articles that are on Infowars.com dealing with the fact that there is a total news blockade
[00:24:49.989 --> 00:25:06.682]  On this information, so we need to go to Infowars.com and other sites and get these videos and get them out to everybody because the October surprise, why is the media ignoring the James O'Keefe video that shows Hillary Clinton supporters inciting violence at Donald Trump rallies?
[00:25:07.751 --> 00:25:09.312]  Inquisitor says claiming.
[00:25:09.712 --> 00:25:10.592]  It doesn't claim it.
[00:25:10.932 --> 00:25:12.073]  We have the WikiLeaks.
[00:25:12.453 --> 00:25:13.653]  We have the police telling us.
[00:25:13.893 --> 00:25:17.275]  We have it on video that they go and start it in Bird Dog and hit people first.
[00:25:17.835 --> 00:25:25.698]  And then we have the organizers from Chicago nationally admitting it.
[00:25:25.758 --> 00:25:26.298]  And guess what?
[00:25:27.238 --> 00:25:30.640]  Matt Dubio that manages one of the big stations we're on in Chicago.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.340]  I said we're on two stations in Chicago.
[00:25:32.901 --> 00:25:34.101]  He's been carrying us about five years.
[00:25:34.141 --> 00:25:35.222]  He's come here and visited with us.
[00:25:35.462 --> 00:25:36.042]  I know his family.
[00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:53.841]  He knows this guy, and he was on during March confirming as a journalist, as the news director, also the manager at the station, that he was there and shot video that went viral, millions of views, that showed them starting the fights when the media was announcing that the Trump people supported it.
[00:25:54.141 --> 00:26:00.545]  So we had the ground video, the Chicago police through our sources, our other sources and the Democratic Party through Roger Stone.
[00:26:02.176 --> 00:26:21.610]  The Wikileaks emails again, and now James O'Keefe video of the National Director for the number one organization for quote, getting out the vote for the Democrats, caught saying, we're going to steal the election like we always do, and cussing a bunch.
[00:26:22.697 --> 00:26:29.038]  And also saying we're busing folks in and also saying we sent people out to bird dog and incite violence.
[00:26:29.339 --> 00:26:37.480]  We have them in the entire chain of command from Soros right through Hillary and Obama right down to their field captains.
[00:26:39.601 --> 00:26:42.521]  We have the entire open and shut case.
[00:26:43.082 --> 00:26:48.963]  A jury would deliberate an hour before convicting them of organized crime and racketeering.
[00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:58.316]  And by the way, organized crime racketeering is when you organize with powerful institutions and groups to suppress people's voting, people's right to work, people's right to travel.
[00:26:58.597 --> 00:27:01.980]  That is what racketeering laws were put in place for.
[00:27:02.921 --> 00:27:04.202]  To stop organized crime.
[00:27:04.822 --> 00:27:07.765]  The bullying tactics of thugs and scum.
[00:27:10.007 --> 00:27:10.928]  And now we have them trying to...
[00:27:12.145 --> 00:27:17.226]  Threaten the FBI, but also offer them bribes to say that Hillary didn't have classified info and lie about it.
[00:27:17.946 --> 00:27:20.747]  And now we have them saying, don't worry Hillary, you're not going to get in trouble.
[00:27:20.947 --> 00:27:24.248]  The shadow government's in control of the media and handling it.
[00:27:24.328 --> 00:27:25.208]  It's all there.
[00:27:25.688 --> 00:27:35.191]  But oh my gosh, there's all these women crying crocodile tears all over every channel going, he talked about grabbing a girl when she threw himself on her.
[00:27:35.211 --> 00:27:40.812]  And you know, I started thinking back to just when I'm hanging out with friends, and I'm not really a potty mouth type guy, but
[00:27:42.145 --> 00:27:51.092]  Just being around other men, most men, it's just like some stupid junior high thing they do where you start making jokes and saying really silly, stupid stuff.
[00:27:51.112 --> 00:27:51.953]  A lot of it's just silly.
[00:27:52.613 --> 00:28:00.039]  Now I'm catching myself going, did I just say that while me and the guys are riding around in a field, you know, hunting deer?
[00:28:02.441 --> 00:28:04.783]  I mean, did I just hear myself say that?
[00:28:04.803 --> 00:28:05.704]  I'm like, wow.
[00:28:07.245 --> 00:28:09.287]  You really don't think about the kind of stuff you say.
[00:28:10.478 --> 00:28:14.761]  The type of really, you know, stupid humor, weird humor, nasty humor.
[00:28:15.421 --> 00:28:30.631]  And that's why I never claim to be some perfect saint, because even though I love God, try to be a good person, and by most standards I'm a very upright person, and don't cheat, and don't steal, and care about things, and a hard-working, a good father, you know, you get around a bunch of boys, get around the guys, I mean, let's not lie.
[00:28:31.912 --> 00:28:34.874]  You start saying some really, you know, uncool stuff.
[00:28:36.357 --> 00:28:38.298]  And, okay, Trump's got a problem.
[00:28:38.999 --> 00:29:05.557]  But compared to organized crime and funding radical Islam to literally enslave women by the millions and hundreds of thousands of dead Christians, and little girls and sex slavery, and Hillary's in there directing it and pushing it, because she hates Christians, and the abortion, and the babies, and keeping them alive, and all the horrors, and the evil, and the brainwashing our kids in schools, and just everything they're doing, and then you watch these women
[00:29:06.337 --> 00:29:10.480]  With all this vitriol, how dare him talk about women, how he wants them.
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:16.924]  Meanwhile, it's the same women when rape accusers and people settle cases with them, Clinton does.
[00:29:17.904 --> 00:29:21.386]  The very same show, the very same women go, these are nothing but tramps.
[00:29:22.747 --> 00:29:26.570]  I mean, they are just so committed to deception.
[00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:27.550]  Shall we come back?
[00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:31.873]  The 12th WikiLeaks data dump.
[00:29:33.055 --> 00:29:35.576]  The latest economic news, and so much more.
[00:29:35.616 --> 00:29:41.298]  But I'm going to play some excerpts of the James O'Keefe bombshells that they don't want you to see.
[00:29:42.459 --> 00:29:45.860]  By the way, the London Independent's reporting that we finally know what Hillary Clinton knew all along.
[00:29:46.221 --> 00:29:46.481]  U.S.
[00:29:46.561 --> 00:29:49.002]  allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar are funding ISIS.
[00:29:49.062 --> 00:29:50.842]  Yeah, she's the one that gave them the weapons.
[00:29:51.163 --> 00:29:52.563]  The emails go further than that.
[00:29:52.803 --> 00:29:54.164]  She's the founder of ISIS.
[00:29:54.444 --> 00:29:56.545]  With Obama, Donald Trump's right again.
[00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:01.455]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.376 --> 00:30:05.060]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.300]  I said to Donald, here's what they're doing.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.621]  They're setting it up as follows.
[00:30:12.241 --> 00:30:15.382]  For three, four months they've been saying the Russians are hacking our elections.
[00:30:16.142 --> 00:30:20.183]  To protect our elections, which are sacred, we want to turn it over to DHS.
[00:30:20.203 --> 00:30:24.124]  The genius who has given us one terrorist attack after another and has done nothing to stop it.
[00:30:24.144 --> 00:30:25.165]  He still has his job, right?
[00:30:25.685 --> 00:30:28.145]  So he wants to now make sure our elections are safe.
[00:30:28.466 --> 00:30:29.266]  Russians are hacking.
[00:30:29.986 --> 00:30:31.127]  Follow the bouncing ball.
[00:30:31.147 --> 00:30:31.767]  No proof.
[00:30:32.127 --> 00:30:50.216]  If Trump wins, which is highly likely by the way, which we can talk about in a minute or two or another time, Trump wins, government declares, oh we have evidence that the Russians hacked it, he's a friend of Putin, the election is null and void, we're going to recall another election in what, six months?
[00:30:50.256 --> 00:30:53.298]  Until then, Mr. Obama has graciously agreed
[00:30:54.278 --> 00:30:57.561]  To continue his public service in the United States of America.
[00:30:57.902 --> 00:30:58.702]  Thank you very much.
[00:30:58.762 --> 00:30:59.884]  We're not taking any questions.
[00:30:59.924 --> 00:31:00.384]  Goodbye.
[00:31:02.466 --> 00:31:11.194]  And we have Biden announcing they're going to launch a giant cyber attack on the Russians and saying if the Russians respond, they may respond militarily, which is a doctrine Hillary came out with two months ago.
[00:31:11.575 --> 00:31:13.857]  And suddenly NATO announced that's their new doctrine.
[00:31:14.077 --> 00:31:15.539]  She's literally calling the show.
[00:31:16.894 --> 00:31:19.758]  All I wanted to say was, I said it to Donald and he didn't take the bait.
[00:31:19.778 --> 00:31:20.398]  I'm glad he didn't.
[00:31:20.458 --> 00:31:23.843]  I said, don't even answer me, because they'll crucify you if you agree with me.
[00:31:24.824 --> 00:31:26.566]  They're going to steal the election.
[00:31:26.726 --> 00:31:27.507]  I'll make it simple.
[00:31:27.547 --> 00:31:30.250]  In the fifth grade, I ran for class president in Queens, New York.
[00:31:31.283 --> 00:31:35.484]  I was a funny kid, I was a wild kid, I was out of control, I won the election by a landslide.
[00:31:36.024 --> 00:31:39.945]  The teacher stood up and said, this election doesn't count.
[00:31:40.225 --> 00:31:43.445]  And she had another election, and I wasn't class president.
[00:31:43.865 --> 00:31:48.566]  So, hey, look, if it could be done in the fifth grade in the Bronx when I was a kid, why can't they do it to us now, right?
[00:31:48.606 --> 00:31:49.266]  We're just children.
[00:31:49.586 --> 00:31:50.867]  I had a similar thing happen.
[00:31:50.887 --> 00:31:57.668]  You know, when you really do things in this world, you start to learn how rigged they are, and it's just crazy to see them go, even though they're the same newscast,
[00:31:58.388 --> 00:31:59.708]  The Russians are rigging the election.
[00:32:00.029 --> 00:32:01.969]  We're having to bring in the UN to oversee it.
[00:32:02.009 --> 00:32:03.410]  And then meanwhile, Trump's crazy.
[00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:07.111]  He says they're rigging the election, even as we catch election officials admitting the fraud.
[00:32:07.311 --> 00:32:08.631]  We do have a minute or two more if you've got it.
[00:32:09.151 --> 00:32:10.172]  Elaborate on what you're saying.
[00:32:10.192 --> 00:32:10.872]  I mean, I agree.
[00:32:10.892 --> 00:32:14.133]  The internal polls, I know from Trump, but also other big groups are doing internal polls.
[00:32:14.653 --> 00:32:16.753]  5, 10, 15 points ahead in most battleground states.
[00:32:17.054 --> 00:32:18.294]  He's going to win in a landslide.
[00:32:18.554 --> 00:32:22.235]  They're only creating the perception he's way behind, so we buy it right now.
[00:32:22.255 --> 00:32:23.115]  Do you concur with that?
[00:32:23.315 --> 00:32:24.876]  A. B. What happens when he gets in?
[00:32:25.777 --> 00:32:25.997]  100% right.
[00:32:26.037 --> 00:32:27.139]  You and I think the same way.
[00:32:27.179 --> 00:32:29.061]  I said that to Donald yesterday on my radio show.
[00:32:29.101 --> 00:32:29.322]  I said...
[00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:36.214]  Donald, I said what they're doing is they're not trying to get people to vote for Hillary.
[00:32:36.254 --> 00:32:38.236]  They've got all the people they could ever, ever get.
[00:32:39.016 --> 00:32:44.380]  I said what they're trying to do is discourage Trump voters from voting by thinking that it's over already.
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:47.022]  They're trying to make them think that he lost, that she won.
[00:32:47.042 --> 00:32:49.264]  So they're going to throw their hands up and not vote for him.
[00:32:49.584 --> 00:32:53.047]  He's got to make sure that people think he can still win, which he can.
[00:32:53.988 --> 00:32:58.831]  And then if all of us who are supporting him come out, I think he will win.
[00:32:59.071 --> 00:32:59.732]  It's that simple.
[00:32:59.912 --> 00:33:01.454]  That's right, you can't steal landslides.
[00:33:01.494 --> 00:33:06.419]  I've interviewed experts who are Democrats, Republicans, die-bold engineers from the highest levels, they agree.
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.742]  You cannot steal a landslide.
[00:33:25.843 --> 00:33:29.746]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:31.347 --> 00:33:36.070]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:44.196 --> 00:33:51.281]  Now, I hate to say, see I told you so every five minutes, but I just want new listeners to understand that we don't normally have the time to go back
[00:33:52.406 --> 00:33:56.989]  And actually grab the clip from the time that we make predictions and lay things out.
[00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:02.513]  But back in March when they really turn up the heat for attacking every Trump rally viciously, remember that?
[00:34:02.573 --> 00:34:04.355]  March, April, May, June, July.
[00:34:06.756 --> 00:34:12.260]  Matt, who's just incredible back there, was just remembered the interview and remembered the date where we let it all out in our sources.
[00:34:13.286 --> 00:34:18.149]  We have the Chicago News Station Director on, and we told you exactly who's behind it.
[00:34:18.209 --> 00:34:26.353]  George Soros, the organizations, the groups, by name, what they were doing, why they were doing it, to blame Bernie Sanders and Trump, taking out both Hillary's enemies.
[00:34:26.773 --> 00:34:40.761]  Now we have the WikiLeaks emails, we have the Hillary Soros controlled group, the head of the group, and then the National Director, both admitting the criminal operation.
[00:34:41.715 --> 00:34:42.596]  I would say it doesn't matter.
[00:34:42.896 --> 00:34:45.759]  We control the media and we control the police.
[00:34:48.182 --> 00:34:49.563]  Now you talk about organized crime.
[00:34:51.726 --> 00:34:53.788]  We have them saying we're above the law.
[00:34:54.028 --> 00:34:55.449]  That's in the new tape today.
[00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:59.073]  And O'Keefe says he's got stuff coming out every day now until the end of the election.
[00:34:59.133 --> 00:34:59.654]  So much of it.
[00:34:59.994 --> 00:35:03.198]  Some of the things he told me months ago about are just unbelievable.
[00:35:03.983 --> 00:35:05.223]  Unbelievable.
[00:35:05.923 --> 00:35:12.065]  And that's really why I catch myself out of breath now and really upset by the end of the show because I don't get to so much of this.
[00:35:12.085 --> 00:35:13.865]  I don't know how Drudge does it.
[00:35:14.025 --> 00:35:15.185]  I just got chills really bad.
[00:35:15.205 --> 00:35:26.227]  And I keep saying that because it's just like my whole body is like in horror mode, like you're cops and you pick up the floorboard in this in this cabin and there's 10 dead kids, you know, you're like want to do something.
[00:35:26.287 --> 00:35:29.588]  And imagine if you knew the person that killed the kids was about to be president.
[00:35:30.248 --> 00:35:31.349]  You would be sick at your stomach.
[00:35:31.369 --> 00:35:32.690]  Well, that's how I am all the time.
[00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:36.893]  I was working at 10 o'clock last night, and I'm not saying thank me for that.
[00:35:37.254 --> 00:35:38.154]  I can't stop.
[00:35:43.218 --> 00:35:44.579]  I mean, this is real, folks.
[00:35:44.639 --> 00:35:46.160]  We're not just putting rhetoric out here.
[00:35:48.082 --> 00:35:55.248]  I am so ashamed of my country and the mainstream media that they would unify, lie like this, and do things like this.
[00:35:55.768 --> 00:35:58.070]  I know there's evil people at the top of the government, but man,
[00:36:00.362 --> 00:36:05.688]  The general public and the media, a large contingent of them, are just bad people.
[00:36:06.208 --> 00:36:07.329]  They have no morals.
[00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:09.592]  I want to ask the Democrats something.
[00:36:09.692 --> 00:36:11.594]  Is there any line you won't cross?
[00:36:11.994 --> 00:36:13.476]  Is there anything you won't do?
[00:36:13.796 --> 00:36:16.479]  Is there anything Hillary could do that you would say is too far?
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:17.961]  Anything!
[00:36:17.981 --> 00:36:19.763]  Because here's the deal.
[00:36:21.294 --> 00:36:23.115]  This is so biblical, this is judgment.
[00:36:23.275 --> 00:36:28.018]  God is showing us, and the Bible says this will happen before total judgment, before a nation goes into bondage.
[00:36:28.479 --> 00:36:31.701]  And historically this happens, whether you believe in God or not, this is a historical cycle.
[00:36:32.521 --> 00:36:34.823]  History does repeat, it does rhyme, as they say.
[00:36:36.364 --> 00:36:46.291]  And all this evil is coming out so much, and what's crazy is, I cannot believe how accurately we understand the enemy, because I'm reading these WikiLeaks,
[00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:51.213]  And it just confirms everything we said, exactly like we said it.
[00:36:51.873 --> 00:36:54.755]  And I'm quite frankly saying, how are we this good?
[00:36:57.657 --> 00:36:59.298]  And then I gotta pull back and go, you're not that good.
[00:36:59.318 --> 00:37:01.920]  These people are formulaic.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.322]  They run criminal, formulaic operations.
[00:37:05.682 --> 00:37:06.763]  You study them all day.
[00:37:06.783 --> 00:37:09.425]  And it's very, very simple.
[00:37:10.285 --> 00:37:16.950]  What's scary is, they've got the mainstream media and the government and the prosecutors almost completely behind them.
[00:37:18.962 --> 00:37:24.344]  And so they know that, and then you see them on tape going, nothing can stop us now!
[00:37:24.644 --> 00:37:25.905]  And then you know what comes next.
[00:37:26.365 --> 00:37:27.405]  It hits you like a ton of bricks.
[00:37:28.286 --> 00:37:29.286]  Oh my God.
[00:37:29.306 --> 00:37:34.628]  It started the paradigm in history, the downward spiral.
[00:37:34.928 --> 00:37:38.850]  They always bring themselves down because they think they're totally invincible.
[00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:46.793]  And so they start doing crazier and crazier and crazier stuff until they destroy themselves and us with them.
[00:37:48.621 --> 00:37:52.285]  In criminology, almost every serial killer does this, but other criminals as well.
[00:37:53.726 --> 00:37:57.009]  Because a lot of criminals do it for the fun of being evil and hurting people.
[00:37:57.329 --> 00:37:59.792]  They don't do it just because they want to feed their starving kids.
[00:38:01.413 --> 00:38:02.434]  That's doing what you got to do.
[00:38:03.575 --> 00:38:06.558]  My kids are starving to death, I can't get them food, I'm breaking into the grocery store.
[00:38:06.738 --> 00:38:09.441]  I'll be quite frank with you, if there's no other way to get the food.
[00:38:11.431 --> 00:38:16.896]  I'll go bang on doors and beg first, you know, chop firewood or whatever, but I'm just saying my kids are just starving to death.
[00:38:17.016 --> 00:38:23.261]  Yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll engage in some criminal activity, but barring that, not going to happen.
[00:38:28.546 --> 00:38:31.448]  I feel bad when I'm on somebody's property, pick up a rock.
[00:38:31.468 --> 00:38:32.029]  I really like it.
[00:38:32.049 --> 00:38:32.509]  I'll ask him.
[00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:34.211]  Once I was on a 12,000 acre ranch.
[00:38:34.231 --> 00:38:35.452]  I said, and I have this rock.
[00:38:36.112 --> 00:38:36.873]  The guy just laughed.
[00:38:36.913 --> 00:38:38.955]  He said, Alex, you're something else.
[00:38:42.352 --> 00:38:49.476]  I've known you since high school and I could give you a million dollars and come back in 10 years and it'd all be there and you'd give it back.
[00:38:51.317 --> 00:38:56.520]  And he went on to say, and by the way, there are not a lot of people like that.
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:03.704]  And I'm not saying I'm some goody two-shoes, I just do not understand the fall and the rot of society.
[00:39:04.964 --> 00:39:06.185]  I just do not understand it.
[00:39:07.827 --> 00:39:14.513]  Because all these disconnected people that have never had to live in the real world, they just think cheating and lying and stealing is cute and funny.
[00:39:15.013 --> 00:39:18.236]  That's what happens at these Gruber events when he's on C-SPAN with a bunch of other professors.
[00:39:18.256 --> 00:39:24.041]  And he goes, and you know, I'm here to teach the undergrads how to lie and how to cheat and you know, how to be successful.
[00:39:24.341 --> 00:39:26.963]  And they're all hanging on his every word.
[00:39:27.764 --> 00:39:32.428]  And so what's happened is a lot of people discovered the new world order and corporatism and the world government.
[00:39:34.246 --> 00:39:35.586]  And they decided to join with it.
[00:39:35.846 --> 00:39:40.388]  I'll never forget, I went to a big conference, a smart growth conference in 1998.
[00:39:40.608 --> 00:39:42.388]  Michael Dell was there, interviewed him, a bunch of other people.
[00:39:42.848 --> 00:39:47.169]  They had all these big former Dallas Cowboys and people, famous ones I grew up watching that were part of it.
[00:39:47.189 --> 00:39:52.450]  And they had all the big banks and they had like 5,000 people there and it was a big UN sanctioned deal.
[00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:57.952]  And I'd go up to them and I'd say, you know, in these documents, you admit you're taking people's private property and then
[00:39:59.065 --> 00:40:03.208]  Building on it later, and this is really just like a form of land grab.
[00:40:04.029 --> 00:40:10.834]  I'll never forget, I didn't have the camera running, and this famous Dallas cowboy goes, of course that's what it is, you dumb son of a bitch!
[00:40:10.894 --> 00:40:12.175]  Get the hell out of my way!
[00:40:12.415 --> 00:40:13.516]  Big, big white guy.
[00:40:14.096 --> 00:40:18.619]  He was just, big, big realtor up in Dallas.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.041]  He just pushed past me.
[00:40:20.541 --> 00:40:21.622]  He's just like, of course.
[00:40:22.955 --> 00:40:26.857]  It's the fact that I was like, you know, 20-something year old investigative reporter.
[00:40:26.877 --> 00:40:28.098]  I'm like, this is really wrong.
[00:40:28.278 --> 00:40:32.821]  They're taking ranchers' farms outside town and not even paying them for it, and then they build on it.
[00:40:33.461 --> 00:40:34.522]  Well, of course we are!
[00:40:34.542 --> 00:40:35.383]  Get out of my way!
[00:40:35.843 --> 00:40:37.984]  And, you know, Michael Dell would just sit there laughing at me.
[00:40:38.504 --> 00:40:39.225]  I'd talk to him.
[00:40:39.265 --> 00:40:44.728]  He was just like sort of laughing, like... See, they all knew!
[00:40:45.248 --> 00:40:47.470]  They're all... It was like, of course, kid!
[00:40:52.591 --> 00:40:54.592]  So it wasn't that I was ever even that smart.
[00:40:56.813 --> 00:41:00.174]  I just didn't join with them like everybody else does.
[00:41:00.354 --> 00:41:03.555]  Almost everybody else who's smart decides to be evil.
[00:41:04.876 --> 00:41:07.136]  That's the big revelation that's been hitting me stronger and stronger.
[00:41:07.156 --> 00:41:09.397]  Because I never thought I was that smart.
[00:41:09.977 --> 00:41:11.378]  I have, I'm naive actually.
[00:41:15.469 --> 00:41:16.050]  And you know what?
[00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:17.812]  The public kind of likes getting screwed.
[00:41:18.033 --> 00:41:19.254]  That's what the elites always tell me.
[00:41:20.015 --> 00:41:22.118]  They go, Alex, they don't want to not be screwed.
[00:41:22.278 --> 00:41:23.100]  They'll screw each other.
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:24.061]  They'll screw you.
[00:41:24.421 --> 00:41:25.363]  Might as well screw them.
[00:41:26.184 --> 00:41:27.085]  Take care of your family.
[00:41:27.366 --> 00:41:27.686]  You know what?
[00:41:27.706 --> 00:41:28.387]  I'm not doing that.
[00:41:28.787 --> 00:41:31.311]  But that's the moment we've come to.
[00:41:32.192 --> 00:41:32.593]  Is that
[00:41:36.556 --> 00:41:46.898]  I went and investigated family ranches and things that went back over a hundred years, where they were ranching and everything, and they were just taking their ranches all over outside Austin, and today they got big mansions built on them.
[00:41:47.958 --> 00:41:51.399]  And they took them and said it was going to be for the earth and the Golden Sheik Warbler, it was all a lie.
[00:41:52.339 --> 00:41:53.260]  And of course they knew that.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:42:00.001]  And it was a big organized crime feeding frenzy of everyone running around wanting to get rich.
[00:42:00.261 --> 00:42:01.721]  There were no liberals at that meeting.
[00:42:02.502 --> 00:42:04.302]  Their liberal outfits were their camouflage.
[00:42:06.598 --> 00:42:12.604]  The minute, just like Hillary Clinton, the minute you'd actually talk to them and there wasn't a camera on, they'd go, of course that's what it is.
[00:42:13.105 --> 00:42:13.826]  Just laugh at me.
[00:42:14.106 --> 00:42:18.130]  And that's why Hillary has her public side, and then she has her private side.
[00:42:18.531 --> 00:42:21.074]  In public, she's like, oh I love black people.
[00:42:21.334 --> 00:42:25.739]  In private, she's like, tell that stupid n-word to get me a piece of cheesecake right now.
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.742]  Tell that dumb n-word.
[00:42:32.148 --> 00:42:34.549]  And her supporters know that they like that too.
[00:42:34.829 --> 00:42:36.289]  That's how most of them are.
[00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:38.990]  At the minion and even controller level.
[00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:42.450]  They're preying on people.
[00:42:42.771 --> 00:42:46.992]  And they want you poor, and they want you stupid, and they want you broke, and they want you unhealthy.
[00:42:49.792 --> 00:42:53.553]  I'm just coming to grips with the fact that they're not becoming more evil now.
[00:42:53.613 --> 00:42:56.714]  They're being forced to reveal who they always were in the media.
[00:42:58.356 --> 00:43:02.761]  They don't let you into it now unless you're a soulless, evil piece of filth.
[00:43:06.845 --> 00:43:08.827]  And the good news is, their whole system's falling.
[00:43:09.087 --> 00:43:20.099]  The bad news is, that's going to induce them to support the end of the free press because the only place they can exist is in a controlled medium where they're not allowed to have competition.
[00:43:22.605 --> 00:43:23.765]  And that's what they say themselves.
[00:43:23.805 --> 00:43:26.086]  So they're coming for us this year and next year.
[00:43:26.987 --> 00:43:28.707]  And get ready, because history's happening.
[00:43:28.747 --> 00:43:31.488]  No matter what happens with Donald Trump, he's only a manifestation of that.
[00:43:31.888 --> 00:43:34.069]  And I'm not a lesser-to-evils guy, but let me tell you something.
[00:43:34.949 --> 00:43:38.851]  Shooting your mouth off to your biographer 20 years ago about a nice piece of tail?
[00:43:41.632 --> 00:43:45.533]  Shooting your mouth off about women throwing themselves at you when you're basically a movie star?
[00:43:47.642 --> 00:43:53.788]  When they have a double standard and all this other horrible stuff Hollywood does, including sexualizing children, that's all supposedly okay.
[00:43:54.048 --> 00:44:05.759]  But then when Trump, who's never claimed to be a perfect, you know, snow-driven lily, does some stuff years ago, and they turn it into the biggest issue in the world, it's all a giant fraud, and you know what?
[00:44:06.179 --> 00:44:09.623]  I'm not even gonna listen to the next stuff they got coming out, and you know they do.
[00:44:11.673 --> 00:44:13.374]  Because it's all a joke.
[00:44:13.454 --> 00:44:14.834]  It's all the devil.
[00:44:15.455 --> 00:44:23.678]  The literal devil telling me, the beast system telling me about somebody they hate, because he's against them, about some of the little sins he's committed.
[00:44:25.359 --> 00:44:29.221]  Which he has repented for publicly, which they've never apologized for.
[00:44:30.561 --> 00:44:33.622]  The raping of women, and the settling of the cases, and all the evil.
[00:44:34.103 --> 00:44:34.823]  I don't want to hear it!
[00:44:36.135 --> 00:44:44.320]  And I don't want to hear the usual suspect, fake Republican, fake Christianoid, you know, garbage that, you know, that go to Bohemian Grove and have gay orgies.
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:50.104]  I don't want to hear from you about how he's immoral, having high school talk about women.
[00:44:50.544 --> 00:44:51.224]  I don't want to hear it.
[00:44:53.206 --> 00:44:56.708]  I don't want to hear your moralizing from the pulpit with these government-run churches.
[00:44:56.988 --> 00:44:58.149]  You can't vote for Trump.
[00:44:58.609 --> 00:45:00.290]  You know, and the whole Glenn Beck thing.
[00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:01.831]  Glenn knows what they've got on Trump.
[00:45:02.051 --> 00:45:02.992]  He knows what's coming out.
[00:45:03.192 --> 00:45:04.893]  He thinks he's bet on the right horse.
[00:45:06.152 --> 00:45:06.853]  The establishment.
[00:45:08.255 --> 00:45:11.679]  We're gonna play the James O'Keefe clips here but first off we need to fund this operation.
[00:45:11.699 --> 00:45:14.724]  We've got free shipping running tonight through tomorrow and that's it.

[00:45:25.848 --> 00:45:27.349]  Past midnight tonight Central.
[00:45:28.169 --> 00:45:31.230]  Live feed, 13 hours of coverage starts at 11 a.m.
[00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:31.570]  Central.
[00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:32.570]  It's already started.

[00:45:53.629 --> 00:45:56.050]  He needs to come out swinging in a big, big way.
[00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:59.032]  But we have this week's main debate mega special.

[00:46:11.271 --> 00:46:12.772]  President attacking us, Hillary the U.N.

[00:46:52.739 --> 00:46:54.641]  It's been sold out for a couple months.
[00:46:55.081 --> 00:46:56.743]  It's Harmful Organism Cleanser.
[00:46:56.763 --> 00:46:58.285]  You've heard the callers calling about it.

[00:47:20.383 --> 00:47:22.424]  The reason that happens is it's got a whole bunch of ingredients.
[00:47:23.125 --> 00:47:31.930]  To source them all organic, then have them all pass California standards upon testing, is the reason this is a very complex formula.
[00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:38.675]  It's got a lot of herbs and known compounds to flush out the body in a healthy, clean, easy way.
[00:47:39.773 --> 00:47:40.553]  True game changer.

[00:48:02.682 --> 00:48:05.843]  Kind of redundant, though.
[00:48:06.083 --> 00:48:07.924]  It is at cost for $9.95 when shipping is
[00:48:09.537 --> 00:48:11.518]  Being applied, but I guess now it's not at cost.
[00:48:11.978 --> 00:48:15.719]  I'm so truthful, I've just got to even catch something on air.
[00:48:15.759 --> 00:48:19.301]  Since we did another special that overlaps another special, it's very affordable.
[00:48:19.321 --> 00:48:19.881]  Put it to you that way.
[00:48:20.381 --> 00:48:21.742]  $9.95, those are going to sell out.
[00:48:22.002 --> 00:48:23.202]  We also have the Don't Tread on Me.
[00:48:23.723 --> 00:48:24.023]  Okay.
[00:48:25.523 --> 00:48:26.944]  The limited edition Don't Tread on Me.
[00:48:27.004 --> 00:48:28.925]  Lock her up at infoawardstore.com.
[00:48:29.225 --> 00:48:31.246]  And please support our local affiliates as well.
[00:48:31.786 --> 00:48:36.748]  Now, before I go any further here, I want to start getting into this James O'Keefe.
[00:48:38.973 --> 00:48:55.949]  Because it's so critical that everybody understand that the White House is saying there's no election fraud, it doesn't exist, it's not happening, but then mainstream media will not air the video he has with the National Director of the main organization that has met 300 plus times now.
[00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:56.490]  It was 200.
[00:48:57.431 --> 00:49:02.296]  The number's growing, we've learned, as the records are being examined via FOIA by Breitbart, 340 times.
[00:49:04.338 --> 00:49:15.425]  At the White House, and he's got his top minion on video saying, we do whatever we want, we do this all the effing time, busing in people to vote over and over again, doesn't matter if journalists catch us, because the media won't cover it.
[00:49:15.845 --> 00:49:18.026]  I mean, you are seeing all of this, and it's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:49:18.887 --> 00:49:23.049]  New bombshell video just released by James O'Keefe on massive voter fraud.
[00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:26.671]  It's all up on DrugsReport.com.
[00:49:27.232 --> 00:49:27.752]  It's all up.
[00:49:29.195 --> 00:49:32.418]  Hillary is aware of all the work that you guys do.
[00:49:32.498 --> 00:49:32.818]  I hope.
[00:49:50.063 --> 00:49:51.544]  The campaign is full of animals.
[00:49:51.564 --> 00:49:53.366]  And then they tell Hillary, like, what's going on?
[00:49:53.446 --> 00:49:55.487]  Well, I mean, Hillary knows who's in command.
[00:49:55.587 --> 00:49:55.908]  Yeah.
[00:49:56.288 --> 00:49:57.729]  I'm not suggesting we wait around.
[00:49:57.929 --> 00:49:59.971]  We need to start this sh** right away.
[00:50:00.051 --> 00:50:00.211]  Okay.
[00:50:00.311 --> 00:50:01.833]  On every one of these fronts.
[00:50:01.893 --> 00:50:02.193]  Okay.
[00:50:02.353 --> 00:50:05.896]  What I call this conflict engagement.
[00:50:06.056 --> 00:50:08.398]  That's your version of re-enfranchisement.
[00:50:08.438 --> 00:50:09.699]  Conflict engagement.
[00:50:09.899 --> 00:50:11.701]  In the lines at Trump rallies.
[00:50:12.621 --> 00:50:15.904]  We're starting anarchy here.
[00:50:17.093 --> 00:50:23.956]  This is part one of our undercover investigation into the dark, backroom dealings of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.
[00:50:24.536 --> 00:50:30.978]  The culmination of a year-long investigation infiltrating the machine from the bottom all the way to the White House.
[00:50:31.759 --> 00:50:33.759]  There are concerns this election will be rigged.
[00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:37.581]  What you're about to see will make you uncomfortable and angry.
[00:50:38.321 --> 00:50:41.542]  It's graphic, uncensored, and disturbing.
[00:50:42.323 --> 00:50:45.304]  Our attorneys say there is strong evidence of criminality.
[00:50:46.104 --> 00:50:55.912]  And this is just part one.
[00:50:55.992 --> 00:51:02.057]  So I'm basically Deputy Graphic Response Director for the DNC for all things drama on the ground.
[00:51:02.418 --> 00:51:03.999]  Nobody's really supposed to know about me.
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:10.004]  I gotta say, we have mentally ill people that we pay to do sh**.
[00:51:10.044 --> 00:51:10.585]  Make no mistake.
[00:51:10.665 --> 00:51:12.026]  His name is Cesar Vargas.
[00:51:12.386 --> 00:51:13.087]  He's in Stanford.
[00:51:13.931 --> 00:51:16.873]  I got a priest to cry on camera once.
[00:51:16.933 --> 00:51:29.300]  You know, Brad and Bob and Lux and myself are all part of the old school method where it doesn't matter what the freaking legal and ethics people say.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.581]  We need to win this mother******.
[00:51:32.001 --> 00:51:36.444]  So Bob is really good friends with them and talked to him this afternoon.
[00:51:36.684 --> 00:51:38.525]  And they're all in.
[00:51:38.605 --> 00:51:40.486]  If we can get 25 grand, they're all in.
[00:51:41.738 --> 00:51:48.746]  There is a narrative that supporters at Trump rallies are violent and dangerous, looking to beat up protesters who don't agree with them.
[00:51:49.627 --> 00:51:55.695]  But our undercover investigation into the Hillary Clinton Democratic Party machine reveals a very different story.
[00:51:56.767 --> 00:52:02.010]  If you're there, and you're protesting, and you do these actions, you will be attacked at Trump rallies.
[00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.931]  That's what we know.
[00:52:03.071 --> 00:52:07.154]  Oh, so that's part of the process of eliciting the reaction.
[00:52:07.194 --> 00:52:14.779]  The whole point of it is we know that Trump's people will freak the f*** out, his security team will freak out, and his supporters will lose their s***.
[00:52:15.259 --> 00:52:16.260]  This is Scott Fovle.
[00:52:16.661 --> 00:52:19.645]  He is the National Field Director for Americans United for Change.
[00:52:20.306 --> 00:52:24.672]  He used to work for People for the American Way, an organization funded by George Soros.
[00:52:25.433 --> 00:52:27.736]  He also has his own company, called the Fovle Group.
[00:52:28.397 --> 00:52:31.160]  He is one of the dark operatives for the Clinton campaign.
[00:52:34.113 --> 00:52:35.393]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:52:35.413 --> 00:52:41.975]  And if you're a radio listener, the arrogance in this guy's eyes, the feeling of we're in charge, we're the boss.
[00:52:42.015 --> 00:52:42.795]  It's like a spirit.
[00:52:42.815 --> 00:52:52.557]  They all have this crazed, hateful, sniveling, wimpiness that they then want to puff up and then again run our lives, tell us how to speak, tell us how to live.
[00:52:52.577 --> 00:52:59.478]  And they're always nastily, you know, giggling and simpering and like criminals out of a cartoon.
[00:53:01.425 --> 00:53:04.266]  But when you study criminology, that's really how these people act.
[00:53:05.246 --> 00:53:07.447]  And I don't care who they are or what they're doing.
[00:53:07.667 --> 00:53:12.248]  I mean, O'Keefe can walk into Acorn after Acorn facility and go, I've got child sex slaves.
[00:53:12.268 --> 00:53:13.169]  They go, fantastic.
[00:53:13.509 --> 00:53:14.849]  We're ready to run the op right now.
[00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:17.550]  All right, I'm bringing these sex slaves in.
[00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:21.691]  And we want to just pay the taxes and give the Democratic Party money.
[00:53:21.711 --> 00:53:22.591]  We'll help you run the op.
[00:53:24.012 --> 00:53:24.452]  Yes, sir.
[00:53:25.814 --> 00:53:33.498]  And I read the op-eds with one of CNN this morning about, thank God America's not about to be white anymore, and whiteness is evil, and we gotta watch them.
[00:53:34.078 --> 00:53:37.460]  But you know, now it's okay to stand for the flag, because now America's brown.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:41.822]  I mean, it's getting weird, folks.
[00:53:42.083 --> 00:53:44.024]  I mean, this is freak-a-zoid.
[00:53:47.185 --> 00:53:47.866]  Now, here is
[00:53:49.079 --> 00:54:04.595]  Matt Dubiel, who is the station manager and news director, one of our great affiliates, that's been carrying us, I think, for five, six years in Chicago, and he was one of the people that had like, I think it was like seven, eight, nine million, last time I checked, cell phone video that he got
[00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:08.210]  And he also had some other higher-def stuff that his wife got.
[00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:13.451]  They're down there at the famous Chicago one that the media blamed on Trump, and he saw it, and it was all their people attacking.
[00:54:13.672 --> 00:54:18.833]  If it wasn't for his footage getting out and a few others, it would have sold that it was actually Trump people that did it.
[00:54:18.893 --> 00:54:22.754]  But we knew day one, and then from our sources discovered who was behind it.
[00:54:22.834 --> 00:54:24.795]  Turns out we were dead on as usual.
[00:54:25.255 --> 00:54:26.515]  That's why they hate our guts, folks.
[00:54:26.575 --> 00:54:27.916]  We know we're on them.
[00:54:28.616 --> 00:54:34.598]  And our investigators, O'Keefe's investigators, linking up with Drudge and others, is an unstoppable team, folks.
[00:54:36.834 --> 00:54:38.055]  Let's play the next clip.
[00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:58.131]  And I don't want to use that term because they know that they weren't- No, that's what it is.
[00:54:58.151 --> 00:54:59.431]  They're hired by George Soros.
[00:54:59.471 --> 00:55:00.251]  He's taking credit.
[00:55:00.812 --> 00:55:02.852]  Hillary, and they're blaming Sanders.
[00:55:02.912 --> 00:55:03.472]  It's incredible.
[00:55:03.512 --> 00:55:04.473]  They paid him to do it.
[00:55:04.953 --> 00:55:05.853]  They're under orders.
[00:55:05.873 --> 00:55:06.713]  They're mercenaries.
[00:55:07.573 --> 00:55:09.154]  And they go in and they do this.
[00:55:09.534 --> 00:55:12.575]  And as soon as they knew that happened, okay, now we're not going to disrupt Trump.
[00:55:13.275 --> 00:55:15.936]  Now we're going to activate, because our threats worked, shut it down.
[00:55:15.956 --> 00:55:23.258]  And now we're going to cause a melee so they can run headlines saying the most dangerous place to be in the world is a Trump rally for a chilling effect.
[00:55:25.578 --> 00:55:31.863]  That's Matt Dubiel, station manager at AM 1530 WCKG.
[00:55:31.923 --> 00:55:35.006]  Again, AM 1530 WCKG.
[00:55:35.607 --> 00:55:39.150]  I'm never really good about plugging our affiliates and appreciating them properly.
[00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:40.551]  I apologize to all of them.
[00:55:40.571 --> 00:55:42.753]  They're all such great people and such patriots.
[00:55:42.813 --> 00:55:49.118]  I'm just so busy battling the New World Order and trying to keep track of what's happening there that I never really service our affiliates properly.
[00:55:50.459 --> 00:55:50.800]  We're good.
[00:56:05.623 --> 00:56:08.385]  We don't really do auto responses, and they get pissed off at us.
[00:56:08.445 --> 00:56:09.826]  Listen, none of it's personal, folks.
[00:56:10.626 --> 00:56:13.288]  I am just fighting 18 hours a day right now.
[00:56:14.029 --> 00:56:14.789]  Understand that.
[00:56:14.849 --> 00:56:16.670]  We are at the parapet of the Alamo here.
[00:56:17.111 --> 00:56:19.052]  We're going on to the end, whatever the cost may be.
[00:56:19.072 --> 00:56:23.255]  We'll defend this republic, but just know that we are all overworked.
[00:56:23.275 --> 00:56:26.757]  We're all basically punch-struck at this point and just moving forward.
[00:56:26.777 --> 00:56:28.318]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:56:28.638 --> 00:56:29.779]  Now, let's go to the latest clip.
[00:56:29.799 --> 00:56:31.020]  Now, again, it's 16 minutes long.
[00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:32.341]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:56:32.361 --> 00:56:33.442]  You want to see the whole thing.
[00:56:33.462 --> 00:56:34.342]  That is
[00:56:35.923 --> 00:56:39.945]  Vogel being questioned by their investigators about voter fraud, election fraud.
[00:56:39.965 --> 00:56:44.228]  Because when you organize a bunch of voters to engage in fraud, it's then election fraud.
[00:56:44.648 --> 00:56:48.110]  Individual doing it is voter fraud.
[00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:50.551]  Organized voter fraud is election fraud.
[00:56:51.211 --> 00:56:53.933]  There's also electronic election fraud, so three different types.
[00:56:54.373 --> 00:56:56.854]  Rigging the election, video two, mass voter fraud.
[00:56:56.874 --> 00:57:03.858]  Let's start playing a few minutes of this while this guy that's smarter than everybody else talks about stealing our republic and robbing democracy.
[00:57:05.034 --> 00:57:10.540]  The question is whether, when you get caught by a reporter, does that matter?
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:13.022]  Because there's a training investigation or not.
[00:57:13.202 --> 00:57:16.205]  In this case, in this state, the answer is no.
[00:57:16.226 --> 00:57:19.649]  Because they don't have any power to do anything.
[00:57:19.829 --> 00:57:20.170]  Right.
[00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:25.735]  So this is sort of maybe not stuff for the general, but stuff to maybe...
[00:57:27.617 --> 00:57:30.498]  No, I think you can do it for the children.
[00:57:30.758 --> 00:57:47.506]  So, what you do is you implement the plan on a much bigger scale to implement a massive change in state legislatures and in Congress.
[00:57:47.626 --> 00:57:53.649]  So you aim higher for your goals and then you implement it
[00:57:54.810 --> 00:57:58.652]  We're going to come back in the next five minutes, and I'm going to play more of this, but I want to back up to the start.
[00:57:59.733 --> 00:58:08.179]  Battleground Texas is part of this, and they caught them a few years ago in Texas saying, we're going to have all the illegals and everybody else vote ten times, Texas will go blue.
[00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:10.781]  This is a military takeover.
[00:58:11.521 --> 00:58:14.203]  And you heard him say, we're doing this now at the state legislature level.
[00:58:14.583 --> 00:58:15.564]  We cannot be stopped.
[00:58:16.424 --> 00:58:19.827]  And then he looks at the camera person and says, what are they going to do?
[00:58:20.067 --> 00:58:20.907]  We're in control now.
[00:58:21.448 --> 00:58:22.709]  This is called tyranny, folks.
[00:58:23.229 --> 00:58:24.189]  We're in control.
[00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:25.510]  We're above the law.
[00:58:25.971 --> 00:58:28.152]  By the way, guess what Hillary did at the foundation?
[00:58:28.212 --> 00:58:30.634]  Nobody cares if she stole billions of dollars from Haitian kids.
[00:58:30.654 --> 00:58:31.935]  It's because they're liberal.
[00:58:31.975 --> 00:58:35.016]  It's OK to kill them, you know, because liberals are doing it.
[00:58:35.517 --> 00:58:38.139]  Turns out they stole the furniture from the State Department, too.
[00:58:39.147 --> 00:58:40.569]  And there was an FBI investigation of that.
[00:58:41.070 --> 00:58:42.812]  I mean, these are criminals.
[00:58:43.313 --> 00:58:45.155]  With incredible criminal energy.
[00:58:45.495 --> 00:58:47.078]  They are a criminal force.
[00:58:47.618 --> 00:58:48.139]  Stay with us.
[00:58:50.442 --> 00:58:52.685]  And the Republican establishment is protecting them.
[00:58:52.945 --> 00:58:53.466]  Remember that.
[00:58:54.307 --> 00:58:54.848]  Remember!
[00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:07.462]  Tonight, tune into Infowars.com forward slash show for live coverage of the big, epic last debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
[00:59:07.642 --> 00:59:09.443]  We're starting our pre-debate show at 3 p.m.
[00:59:09.483 --> 00:59:11.503]  Central, right after the main transmission.
[00:59:11.583 --> 00:59:14.624]  So if you're already watching the Alex Jones Show, just continue watching.
[00:59:14.824 --> 00:59:15.365]  At 7 p.m.
[00:59:15.405 --> 00:59:17.605]  Central, we'll go over what to watch for during the debate.
[00:59:17.905 --> 00:59:19.486]  And the debate starts at 8 p.m.
[00:59:19.526 --> 00:59:19.886]  Central.
[00:59:20.066 --> 00:59:27.411]  Now this debate is not just about Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton, but rather it's about how the shadow government is finally uncloaking before our very eyes to destroy U.S.
[00:59:27.451 --> 00:59:27.911]  sovereignty.
[00:59:27.991 --> 00:59:36.117]  The latest WikiLeaks emails reveal the inner workings of the global elite who are forging an authoritarian society dominated by technocrats and government technology and media.
[00:59:36.237 --> 00:59:37.337]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:10.049 --> 01:00:11.930]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[01:00:12.330 --> 01:00:13.671]  It's like lightning in a bottle!
[01:00:13.911 --> 01:00:17.453]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[01:00:17.813 --> 01:00:22.455]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and- InfoWars.com, folks.
[01:00:34.795 --> 01:00:37.197]  They're not censoring that yet, but they're trying to.
[01:00:37.298 --> 01:00:37.978]  Google and others.
[01:00:38.018 --> 01:00:40.080]  That's come out in new documents being released.
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:41.041]  They're planning to take over the web.
[01:00:41.642 --> 01:00:45.906]  CNN and others are now cutting satellite feeds whenever WikiLeaks is brought up.
[01:00:46.447 --> 01:00:51.592]  And Drudge just has the entire devastating rundown on that.
[01:00:54.668 --> 01:00:57.549]  New Bill Clinton sexual assault accuser goes public for the first time.
[01:00:57.569 --> 01:00:58.449]  There's video of that.
[01:00:58.809 --> 01:00:59.990]  We're going to be playing that coming up.
[01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:01.930]  WikiLeaks dump number 12.
[01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:07.152]  Podesta email reveals cozy relationship with Hollywood and how they're directing the news media.
[01:01:07.512 --> 01:01:09.053]  Soros mentioned 50 times.
[01:01:09.393 --> 01:01:09.753]  Memo.
[01:01:09.853 --> 01:01:12.034]  Google Schmidt working directly with the campaign.
[01:01:12.474 --> 01:01:16.515]  Well, they've already pledged that to manipulate traffic and cover up stuff for Hillary.
[01:01:18.217 --> 01:01:33.840]  Imagine how busy Hillary's people are, like, they run the New York Times, they run all the major networks, all stories get approved, you know, double their agenda, from global warming to the campaign, and then they also tell Google what to do with search terms, like delist Donald Trump completely, remember that?
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:38.300]  And then we expose it like whack-a-mole, then they stop for a while but pop back up.
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:39.861]  I mean, it's just unbelievable!
[01:01:41.001 --> 01:01:44.482]  We're actually in a battle with authoritarians trying to completely take over.
[01:01:45.102 --> 01:01:46.882]  And they say next they're going to shut us off next year.
[01:01:49.704 --> 01:01:52.585]  I'll never stop fighting, but okay, the American people want that.
[01:01:52.605 --> 01:01:55.386]  I mean, I guess I'll just boyvaniage.
[01:01:55.886 --> 01:01:56.806]  Okay, whatever.
[01:01:57.946 --> 01:02:02.588]  All you idiots out there that think you're going to get some free stuff now, they are going to rape you financially.
[01:02:03.048 --> 01:02:03.448]  Woo!
[01:02:04.208 --> 01:02:05.249]  Man, you get ready.
[01:02:05.529 --> 01:02:07.549]  Boy, I tell you what, get ready.
[01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:10.130]  You've never been raped like you're about to get raped.
[01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:16.352]  I mean, they have got their knives out, they're sharpening them, like a big old Christmas hog they got laid out.
[01:02:16.932 --> 01:02:19.293]  Trump wanted to cut taxes 50% and make you rich.
[01:02:20.766 --> 01:02:23.607]  Now they have their way, they're gonna hurt you good.
[01:02:23.627 --> 01:02:32.589]  There's a new video, O'Keefe, that explains how the Dems commit the fraud.
[01:02:33.149 --> 01:02:34.590]  Just exactly what Larry Nichols keeps saying.
[01:02:35.330 --> 01:02:38.771]  We go to the poor areas, we got a list of dead voters, people that don't vote.
[01:02:39.731 --> 01:02:42.572]  We load people on, poor people, black, white, doesn't matter.
[01:02:43.132 --> 01:02:46.153]  We take them to different polling places and they vote ten times a day, Alex.
[01:02:47.176 --> 01:02:47.997]  I've been telling you that for a year.
[01:02:48.497 --> 01:02:49.998]  That's what they're doing now.
[01:02:50.458 --> 01:02:52.440]  They're loading the buses up, Alex.
[01:02:53.401 --> 01:02:55.042]  And they're doing the early voting, Alex.
[01:02:55.102 --> 01:02:56.243]  And they're going to vote again.
[01:02:58.764 --> 01:03:02.347]  But we don't need him to help get the Clintons actually elected and was their handler.
[01:03:02.667 --> 01:03:11.514]  We have the National Director, the head guy funded 340 times at the White House the last two years.
[01:03:13.632 --> 01:03:16.933]  And here's his main adjunct, Mr. Vogel, bragging.
[01:03:16.973 --> 01:03:18.253]  Let's play some more of the Veritas piece.
[01:03:19.353 --> 01:03:23.114]  The question is whether, when you get caught by a reporter, does that matter?
[01:03:23.134 --> 01:03:27.095]  Because does it turn you into an investigator or not?
[01:03:27.536 --> 01:03:34.497]  In this case, in this state, where, you know, because they don't have any power to do anything.
[01:03:34.597 --> 01:03:35.058]  Right.
[01:03:35.158 --> 01:03:40.059]  So, so this is sort of maybe, maybe not stuff for the general, but stuff to maybe
[01:03:40.999 --> 01:03:45.582]  No, I think you can do it for the general election.
[01:03:45.762 --> 01:04:00.911]  So, what you do is you implement the plan on a much bigger scale to implement a massive change in state legislatures and in Congress.
[01:04:01.131 --> 01:04:07.494]  So you aim higher for your goals and then you implement it across
[01:04:09.215 --> 01:04:20.403]  I'm going to play more of this.
[01:04:20.664 --> 01:04:31.812]  They talk about how to bring the buses in, how to have people vote ten times a piece, all on video, and how they're organizing it nationwide, and he looks right at the person filming him and goes, with a hidden camera, and goes,
[01:04:32.762 --> 01:04:33.483]  What are they going to do?
[01:04:33.583 --> 01:04:34.625]  We run the state.
[01:04:34.665 --> 01:04:35.486]  We run the laws.
[01:04:35.907 --> 01:04:36.708]  We run the country.
[01:04:37.389 --> 01:04:38.591]  There's nothing they can do.
[01:04:38.611 --> 01:04:41.496]  And he is on such a power trip.
[01:04:41.917 --> 01:04:43.920]  It's his to steal his election.
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:44.861]  He runs it now.
[01:04:45.342 --> 01:04:46.945]  I mean, good God!
[01:04:49.110 --> 01:04:52.373]  But just like Nazis, they're run with an ideology where they're the good guys.
[01:04:53.153 --> 01:04:58.138]  And he's just all excited and like, gripping his glasses all, we run things, they can't stop us now.
[01:04:59.018 --> 01:05:02.201]  See, they've got the FBI, they've got the courts, they've got it, they've got it.
[01:05:02.381 --> 01:05:03.162]  They think they do!
[01:05:03.182 --> 01:05:05.824]  And who cares if journalists catch it on tape?
[01:05:05.864 --> 01:05:06.425]  What are you gonna do?
[01:05:09.232 --> 01:05:10.532]  We're red on election day.
[01:05:10.652 --> 01:05:13.613]  Perhaps the biggest election in American history is just days away.
[01:05:13.773 --> 01:05:18.334]  We know that in past elections, there have been thousands of cases of voter fraud and election fraud.
[01:05:18.394 --> 01:05:25.616]  From dead people voting, to people registering false identifications, to government leaders providing fast-track amnesty to give illegal immigrants votes.
[01:05:25.796 --> 01:05:27.256]  This is happening right in front of us.
[01:05:27.476 --> 01:05:31.877]  Now we are seeing the establishment send all its hitmen after the Republican nominee, Donald Trump.
[01:05:31.937 --> 01:05:33.838]  Government shills are campaigning for Clinton.
[01:05:33.938 --> 01:05:37.121]  Mainstream news attacking Donald Trump all day like rabbit hounds.
[01:05:37.301 --> 01:05:44.066]  Rigged polls being broadcast daily to provide the fake optics that Hillary Clinton is actually winning and to discourage people from voting Trump.
[01:05:44.186 --> 01:05:46.747]  Fake celebrities endorsing Clinton across all platforms.
[01:05:46.968 --> 01:05:50.190]  So with all this, what are we doing to keep this election from being stolen?
[01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:52.291]  What can we do to prevent election fraud?
[01:05:52.431 --> 01:05:55.531]  I propose that all Donald Trump supporters wear red on election day.
[01:05:55.651 --> 01:05:59.412]  On November 8th, when you head to the polls to vote Donald Trump, be decked out in red.
[01:05:59.512 --> 01:06:05.534]  This way, just as we dominated in rally turnout, we can prove and provide the optics that we also dominated in voter turnout.
[01:06:05.654 --> 01:06:08.535]  Wear red on election day and make America great again.
[01:06:09.475 --> 01:06:11.196]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[01:06:11.776 --> 01:06:13.116]  It's like lightning in a bottle.

[01:07:14.590 --> 01:07:17.913]  After the election, this t-shirt will no longer be available.

[01:07:30.123 --> 01:07:34.447]  This is a meme that is still viral worldwide, Hillary for Prison.
[01:07:34.747 --> 01:07:40.452]  Folks, we want to see Hillary Clinton put in prison, and we also want to see InfoWars go to the next level.

[01:08:12.267 --> 01:08:14.431]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:08:14.952 --> 01:08:20.082]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:08:33.772 --> 01:08:44.217]  Now, he's a busy guy, so I'm not going to keep him long, but just like we talk about James O'Keefe and Project Veritas devastating the criminal Democratic Party and the Republicans that work hand-in-glove with them.
[01:08:46.953 --> 01:08:55.462]  Joe Seals just started right-side broadcasting, I don't know, in the last year, because he was just simply, you know, wanting to see Trump's speeches, but the media wasn't carrying all of them.
[01:08:56.003 --> 01:09:10.538]  He went out, discovered it, how he could hook up, how he could subscribe to the feeds, began putting it up there, and now is funding just via donations a whole launch of a radio slash TV network that already reaches millions of people every day now.
[01:09:11.525 --> 01:09:13.588]  And again, this is how we defeat the globalists.
[01:09:13.609 --> 01:09:21.301]  We build our own system, we tune out of them, and we build such a tsunami of new media that they have big trouble shutting us down.
[01:09:22.162 --> 01:09:25.347]  And we educate people to value independent new media.
[01:09:26.394 --> 01:09:27.895]  That's what it all comes down to.
[01:09:28.235 --> 01:09:32.418]  Right Side Radio on YouTube or RSVN.TV.
[01:09:32.438 --> 01:09:36.181]  A lot of folks are saying, why do you have Michael Savage on promoting his show and his book?
[01:09:37.662 --> 01:09:39.744]  I'm not charging him to do that, or why do I have these folks on?
[01:09:39.764 --> 01:09:40.965]  Because we're all in this together, folks.
[01:09:41.385 --> 01:09:43.487]  We have foreign megabanks funding.
[01:09:45.608 --> 01:09:46.389]  Organizations.
[01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:49.251]  Run by Robert Kramer.
[01:09:52.088 --> 01:10:10.735]  National organizations, top Democrat organizations with Scott Foval and others running around bragging, yes we've got illegals voting, yes we're busting in people to vote 10 times, it doesn't matter because we control the press and the police and we're above the law.
[01:10:10.755 --> 01:10:16.857]  I mean I just played that clip twice in the last hour and they go on in this long 16 minute video
[01:10:18.987 --> 01:10:24.611]  He grips his glasses and shakes with pleasure and says, and there's nothing they can do to stop us.
[01:10:25.091 --> 01:10:26.372]  We run everything.
[01:10:26.572 --> 01:10:30.355]  And we're going to overthrow all the legislatures of the states now and we're taking over.
[01:10:32.096 --> 01:10:34.017]  And then we're like, hey, you better have an ID to vote.
[01:10:34.317 --> 01:10:35.698]  People are voting over and over again.
[01:10:36.679 --> 01:10:38.080]  And they go, that's racist.
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.101]  Hey, Obamacare doubles and triples prices.
[01:10:40.321 --> 01:10:41.122]  That's racist.
[01:10:41.702 --> 01:10:42.763]  Hey, you're starting war with Russia.
[01:10:42.823 --> 01:10:43.343]  That's racist.
[01:10:43.563 --> 01:10:45.384]  Hey, you're funding jihadis and slaving women.
[01:10:45.564 --> 01:10:46.145]  That's racist.
[01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:48.351]  That's all they do.
[01:10:50.533 --> 01:10:54.616]  WikiLeaks comes out and it turns out Hillary's meeting with foreign banks for the takeover of the U.S.
[01:10:54.636 --> 01:10:56.598]  and bringing us into bankruptcy.
[01:10:56.638 --> 01:10:57.819]  Trump covers it last Friday.
[01:10:58.079 --> 01:10:59.421]  And what did the national media say?
[01:10:59.621 --> 01:11:00.502]  That's racist!
[01:11:02.056 --> 01:11:03.336]  They said that's anti-semitic!
[01:11:03.737 --> 01:11:07.018]  They said Alex Jones and Donald Trump, that was the main ones last week.
[01:11:07.898 --> 01:11:09.279]  They're anti-semitic now.
[01:11:09.459 --> 01:11:09.739]  What?
[01:11:10.479 --> 01:11:13.220]  That's right, we're against George Soros so we're anti-semitic.
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:23.144]  George Soros is a fricking Nazi collaborator who rounded up thousands of his fellow Jews on record, went on 60 Minutes and said he's not ashamed of it.
[01:11:25.205 --> 01:11:36.149]  What parallel dark satire universe am I living in that I'm anti-semitic because I'm against some freak who the new James Bond villain in the last movie is based on.
[01:11:36.169 --> 01:11:37.909]  MI6 helped write the script.
[01:11:37.929 --> 01:11:38.570]  They hate him.
[01:11:38.770 --> 01:11:39.910]  He tried to overthrow England.
[01:11:40.090 --> 01:11:40.951]  He brags about it.
[01:11:41.151 --> 01:11:43.331]  He's a monster who just overthrew Ukraine.
[01:11:43.531 --> 01:11:44.932]  He brags about it on CNN.
[01:11:45.252 --> 01:11:48.653]  We're against him overthrowing our country and we're anti-semitic?
[01:11:48.873 --> 01:11:49.574]  Then fine!
[01:11:49.634 --> 01:11:50.334]  Call me that!
[01:11:51.514 --> 01:11:53.515]  You people are scum is what you are.
[01:11:55.902 --> 01:12:11.407]  Now, I wanted to get Joe, he's a busy guy, he's a humble guy, I didn't even want to come on, but I said, you know, come on, let's talk about what you're doing, how exciting it is, where this is going, and, you know, how they've got the debate tonight with their feeds, we've got the feeds as well, we're going to be here.
[01:12:12.028 --> 01:12:13.848]  The great part is they shut us down, they're up.
[01:12:13.888 --> 01:12:15.209]  You know, we need more of this.
[01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:18.670]  We need more resistance because we're this close to winning.
[01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:20.971]  Joe, I mean, do you agree with me that really
[01:12:21.591 --> 01:12:23.275]  Nationalism, the tide is rising.
[01:12:23.695 --> 01:12:25.639]  We've got a Nigel Farage interview coming up, by the way.
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:26.902]  David Knight's about to conduct that.
[01:12:26.922 --> 01:12:28.164]  We're going to have that for everybody soon.
[01:12:28.625 --> 01:12:29.407]  He's out in Vegas.
[01:12:29.928 --> 01:12:32.873]  I mean, so much exciting things are happening, sir.
[01:12:34.331 --> 01:12:36.832]  Absolutely, Alex, and it's really good to be with you.
[01:12:36.932 --> 01:12:38.192]  We appreciate everything you do.
[01:12:38.232 --> 01:12:40.252]  We're big fans of yours here at Right Side.
[01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:48.654]  And you know, it really is just, you know, it's going to take people like us, just regular, average, normal guys, to do the job that the media won't do.
[01:12:48.754 --> 01:12:49.654]  We're fed up with it.
[01:12:50.175 --> 01:12:51.035]  We're tired of it.
[01:12:52.195 --> 01:13:00.777]  We have noticed our broadcast, you know, getting so many more viewers over the last several months, because people finally are waking up and seeing this corrupt crap that's going on.
[01:13:01.417 --> 01:13:02.159]  We're good to go.
[01:13:12.941 --> 01:13:22.569]  We've seen people flock to us, we've seen people flock to InfoWars, to, you know, people who are finally, you know, deciding to come out and just say, enough!
[01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:23.290]  Enough!
[01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:32.077]  And that's why we started RightSide, is to give an alternative to all the crap that's going on, which just, I mean, it's just disgusting.
[01:13:32.097 --> 01:13:39.063]  Well, Joe, what makes me so exciting is, and I want to talk about your success story, not to brag about you, I know you're a humble guy, but as a microcosm for others,
[01:13:39.804 --> 01:13:41.425]  I mean, you were a stay-at-home dad.
[01:13:41.445 --> 01:13:49.189]  I mean, I've got your bio right here, like a year ago, and then now you're reaching, conservatively, 15 million people a week.
[01:13:49.209 --> 01:13:51.470]  I mean, I can go see your numbers on YouTube alone.
[01:13:52.051 --> 01:13:53.351]  We're reaching 30 million a week.
[01:13:53.371 --> 01:13:55.933]  I mean, I hope you reach 100 million, 5 billion.
[01:13:56.153 --> 01:13:57.774]  We're gonna beat these people, but...
[01:13:58.624 --> 01:13:59.946]  It's down to the wire, folks.
[01:14:00.026 --> 01:14:06.196]  It's down to the wire, and people have to understand that we can defeat the globalists, but we've all got to get aggressive.
[01:14:06.436 --> 01:14:13.187]  And it may be putting a bumper sticker on your car, it may be calling in to talk radio or starting your own podcast, or whatever it is, or it might be...
[01:14:14.361 --> 01:14:15.121]  Legal stunts.
[01:14:15.201 --> 01:14:22.203]  I mean, $100,000 we put out to go out and yell Bill Clinton's a rapist, if you ideologically believe that, which he settled cases.
[01:14:22.423 --> 01:14:23.383]  This is war, folks.
[01:14:23.663 --> 01:14:25.424]  They want a war, they're getting one.
[01:14:25.464 --> 01:14:25.924]  Go ahead.
[01:14:25.944 --> 01:14:27.284]  Tell folks about your success story.
[01:14:27.304 --> 01:14:28.584]  Absolutely.
[01:14:28.624 --> 01:14:29.345]  Listen, you're right.
[01:14:29.365 --> 01:14:32.305]  It is a war, and we all have to come together.
[01:14:36.047 --> 01:14:46.116]  Infowars, us, you know, Breitbart, there's a lot of new media out there that are doing some really good things and, you know, it's taking... And America is fighting for its life!
[01:14:46.156 --> 01:14:47.237]  That is not rhetoric.
[01:14:47.297 --> 01:14:49.840]  We are fighting for our lives here, people!
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:54.424]  Actual, hardcore, evil people are taking over that want to hurt us.
[01:14:54.685 --> 01:14:57.507]  We're not getting conquered by Boss Hogg.
[01:14:57.527 --> 01:14:59.649]  We're getting conquered by really bad people.
[01:14:59.689 --> 01:15:00.010]  Go ahead.
[01:15:00.777 --> 01:15:03.559]  Right, because we, you know, look, we didn't want to do this.
[01:15:03.699 --> 01:15:04.539]  I didn't want to do this.
[01:15:04.559 --> 01:15:05.460]  I had a nice life.
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:11.964]  And, you know, my life over the last year has been, you know, I don't spend time with my family anymore.
[01:15:12.004 --> 01:15:18.948]  And the reason I justify this every day is because I want to, I want my kids to grow up in a world that makes sense.
[01:15:18.988 --> 01:15:23.551]  I want my kids to grow up in a world that is free of all this
[01:15:24.241 --> 01:15:28.446]  We're talking about lawyers, EMTs, these are people that don't have formal experience in media.
[01:15:44.329 --> 01:15:46.190]  Hey, I wasn't good at it 20-something years ago when I started.
[01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:49.332]  Again, they say necessity is the mother of invention.
[01:15:49.392 --> 01:15:50.712]  And what's so beautiful about this, Joe,
[01:16:03.599 --> 01:16:04.079]  Absolutely.
[01:16:04.119 --> 01:16:05.379]  We have a hundred million views almost now.
[01:16:30.359 --> 01:16:30.920]  We're good to go.
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:58.963]  You know, the mainstream media can't cover a lot of this WikiLeaks stuff because so much of it involves them.
[01:16:59.563 --> 01:17:05.905]  And people like CNN openly telling their viewers the other day, you know, oh, you can't look at this stuff.
[01:17:05.965 --> 01:17:06.585]  It's illegal.
[01:17:06.685 --> 01:17:07.406]  You can't look at it.
[01:17:08.426 --> 01:17:10.510]  And people are starting to call BS on that.
[01:17:11.011 --> 01:17:16.580]  And we are just, we're just so happy to be a part of all this and, you know, bringing this to life.
[01:17:17.041 --> 01:17:18.523]  And look, this is not about us.
[01:17:18.684 --> 01:17:19.265]  I don't care.
[01:17:19.405 --> 01:17:20.647]  I'd like to be successful.
[01:17:20.727 --> 01:17:21.669]  I'd like to make money.
[01:17:22.412 --> 01:17:23.793]  But this is country first.
[01:17:24.314 --> 01:17:24.834]  Absolutely.
[01:17:40.868 --> 01:17:45.293]  So when you talk about reaching 100 million people, brother, it's way more than that, and that's exponential.
[01:17:45.313 --> 01:17:56.787]  And again, it's the fact that you took action as one person, and now have hundreds of people working through you and with you, just in a volunteer operation, but the expenses get paid, and you're turning the tide.
[01:17:56.848 --> 01:17:57.709]  This is a game changer.
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:17:59.400]  Absolutely.
[01:17:59.421 --> 01:18:00.241]  This is the thing.
[01:18:00.801 --> 01:18:02.222]  You know, it's so true.
[01:18:02.282 --> 01:18:10.388]  When we go, and I've been to some of these Trump rallies now, and I sit right there in the press pen with all the rest of the still entrants there, and they refuse.
[01:18:10.448 --> 01:18:17.813]  This is, you know, the one thing that got us, that I said, you know, let's, let's go to these events and start shooting instead of just paying for access to the feed.
[01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:22.216]  Let's go, because Trump would always say, the media never shows the crowd.
[01:18:22.496 --> 01:18:23.096]  And it's true.
[01:18:23.817 --> 01:18:25.678]  And they were just cutting the crowds.
[01:18:25.778 --> 01:18:26.378]  You've caught them.
[01:18:26.398 --> 01:18:28.060]  They cut the feed a lot of times.
[01:18:29.641 --> 01:18:38.468]  When the black preachers and the black folks are running up hugging Trump and there's this great moment and Trump has tears in his eyes and everybody's coming together, you hear Reuters go, cut it, cut it, cut it now.
[01:18:38.508 --> 01:18:39.068]  Absolutely.
[01:18:39.348 --> 01:18:42.130]  And we actually offered that cameraman from Reuters the job.
[01:18:42.170 --> 01:18:43.011]  I never heard from him.
[01:18:43.071 --> 01:18:44.232]  I hope he's okay.
[01:18:44.812 --> 01:18:45.453]  He says no.
[01:18:45.493 --> 01:18:47.214]  He goes, no, you can fire me or whatever.
[01:18:47.314 --> 01:18:47.915]  I'm filming this.
[01:18:48.555 --> 01:18:50.337]  And they go, nope, that's it, cut it, cut the feed.
[01:18:51.107 --> 01:18:51.307]  Yeah.
[01:18:51.888 --> 01:18:55.694]  So I think he refused and they finally just shut the feed internally.
[01:18:56.375 --> 01:19:00.020]  But the thing is, we wanted to show the massive crowd at these events.
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:03.104]  You're talking about 25,000, 30,000 people at these events.
[01:19:03.705 --> 01:19:06.389]  And it's as simple as spinning the camera around.
[01:19:06.429 --> 01:19:07.431]  I've seen from call
[01:19:08.072 --> 01:19:13.095]  You know, turn those cameras around the show and, you know, the guys are sitting down in chairs.
[01:19:13.235 --> 01:19:16.216]  They have a producer's line open and I know what's being said to them.
[01:19:16.637 --> 01:19:17.657]  Don't move that camera.
[01:19:17.717 --> 01:19:19.118]  A lot of these people want to.
[01:19:19.498 --> 01:19:24.381]  I've talked to these cameramen myself who work for some of these big networks at the events.
[01:19:24.481 --> 01:19:27.983]  My guys talk to them all the time and they say, you guys are the future of the media.
[01:19:28.403 --> 01:19:35.307]  You guys, I know that they like us and I know that they, some of them are even Trump supporters, but they have direct orders not to spin the cameras.
[01:19:35.327 --> 01:19:35.927]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:19:35.967 --> 01:19:37.008]  And now this is coming out.
[01:19:37.748 --> 01:19:39.730]  We have dozens and dozens of videos now.
[01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:53.844]  We ought to do a compilation video about when America became authoritarian, where CNN, MSNBC, when somebody talks about Bill Clinton and rape, somebody talks about Bill Clinton and corruption, or Hillary Clinton and WikiLeaks, they cut the feed.
[01:19:53.884 --> 01:19:57.968]  So here's Cuomo from his storied family of corruption.
[01:19:58.388 --> 01:19:59.429]  Here he is on CNN.
[01:20:01.135 --> 01:20:04.517]  And he's saying, you're not allowed to look at WikiLeaks.
[01:20:04.597 --> 01:20:05.098]  It's illegal.
[01:20:05.158 --> 01:20:06.258]  You've got to go through us.
[01:20:07.079 --> 01:20:13.683]  And then it cuts to yesterday when somebody brings up WikiLeaks and they literally cut the feed and he makes a joke about it.
[01:20:14.064 --> 01:20:15.304]  This is what we're talking about.
[01:20:15.585 --> 01:20:17.546]  And folks, they're not just going to do this in mainstream TV.
[01:20:17.766 --> 01:20:22.449]  They're coming for us next because we're already bigger than them and they know it.
[01:20:22.969 --> 01:20:23.310]  OK?
[01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:26.572]  And every week there are new people popping up that are incredibly successful.
[01:20:26.792 --> 01:20:27.933]  They're in panic mode.
[01:20:28.153 --> 01:20:29.714]  There are high school students, folks.
[01:20:30.434 --> 01:20:33.795]  They're putting out videos weekly that get an average of 10 million views.
[01:20:34.315 --> 01:20:38.035]  Some of them get 60 million views per video that are political.
[01:20:38.315 --> 01:20:40.816]  The Daily Show doesn't get that many viewers in a month.
[01:20:41.136 --> 01:20:42.776]  They're crapping themselves.
[01:20:43.136 --> 01:20:43.896]  They're in panic.
[01:20:43.936 --> 01:20:45.457]  They must shut us down.
[01:20:45.797 --> 01:20:46.657]  We are winning.
[01:20:46.957 --> 01:20:47.977]  They are losing.
[01:20:48.237 --> 01:20:50.117]  Trump's 15 points ahead in general polls.
[01:20:50.277 --> 01:20:58.719]  That's why he says it's all rigged, because he knows when they've got a Reuters poll that samples 40-something percent more Democrats than Republicans, who's going to win that poll, folks?
[01:20:59.199 --> 01:21:01.540]  I mean, they think we're so freaking stupid!
[01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:02.101]  Excuse me.
[01:21:02.781 --> 01:21:05.162]  I'm ranting with the CEO of Right Side Broadcasting.
[01:21:05.182 --> 01:21:06.663]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:21:07.403 --> 01:21:14.847]  I wanted to say, I wanted to let everybody know that the Trump campaign is also finally getting wise to all this.
[01:21:15.128 --> 01:21:19.610]  And they are tonight, for the first time, and this is the first time I'm actually announcing this,
[01:21:20.462 --> 01:21:21.963]  I hope it's okay with them that I do.
[01:21:22.503 --> 01:21:30.387]  But they are tonight going to take their message straight to the people after the debate is over with tonight.
[01:21:30.907 --> 01:21:32.468]  We know what CNN is going to say.
[01:21:32.488 --> 01:21:33.989]  We know what MSNBC is going to say.
[01:21:34.029 --> 01:21:35.009]  We know what they're all going to say.
[01:21:35.029 --> 01:21:38.131]  Hillary could fall down and die on the stage and they would say she won.
[01:21:38.291 --> 01:21:39.672]  Absolutely.
[01:21:39.732 --> 01:21:44.254]  And so tonight, the Trump campaign is holding their own post-game debate show.
[01:21:45.043 --> 01:21:51.649]  With their people, and it will be a live exclusive on Trump's Facebook, and we're the ones that are going to be there filming it.
[01:21:51.749 --> 01:21:55.952]  You can also see it on rsbn.tv, our website, but we will be there.
[01:21:55.972 --> 01:22:00.957]  And I should add, you're graciously allowing us to have your feed as well, so we'll be able to simulcast with you.
[01:22:02.293 --> 01:22:03.433]  Yes sir, absolutely.
[01:22:22.471 --> 01:22:24.333]  That is amazing, and this is what it's about.
[01:22:24.373 --> 01:22:30.420]  It's about finally breaking that stronghold that the mainstream media has, and we're doing it one viewer at a time.
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:33.884]  And with this broadcast, we're going to reach tens of millions of people tonight.
[01:22:34.485 --> 01:22:37.528]  And this is what it's going to take.
[01:22:37.768 --> 01:22:40.051]  It's taking people like us that have finally had enough.
[01:22:40.171 --> 01:22:42.574]  And I'm telling you, there's a growing number of those people.
[01:22:42.714 --> 01:22:44.194]  Joe Seals, this is so exciting.
[01:22:44.234 --> 01:22:45.415]  Thank you for announcing this here.
[01:22:45.715 --> 01:22:49.576]  Take a few minutes to talk about it, then I'm going to put a report out that, I mean, this is great.
[01:22:49.636 --> 01:22:51.076]  No, in fact, it's good to announce this.
[01:22:51.397 --> 01:22:59.539]  Trump is going to just ignore the mainstream media, wade through them, go into right-side broadcasting, and boom, have his own press conference.
[01:22:59.599 --> 01:23:00.699]  This is genius.
[01:23:01.119 --> 01:23:02.700]  Oh my gosh, please lay it out for us.
[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:18.610]  So, okay, so it's not actually Trump, but all of the members of the campaign, our surrogates, we're having people like Giuliani, all those people will be taking their message directly to the people via Facebook and also through our website.
[01:23:18.670 --> 01:23:20.692]  But I would imagine Trump will probably come over too, knowing him.
[01:23:21.539 --> 01:23:24.300]  He may do so, and we'll be ready for him if he is.
[01:23:25.021 --> 01:23:30.383]  The broadcast will begin about 5 or 10 minutes after the debate is over with from the spin room.
[01:23:30.423 --> 01:23:33.044]  We'll be live from the spin room in Las Vegas.
[01:23:33.505 --> 01:23:40.568]  We got two camera guys out there ready to go, and we're going to take the message straight to the people and say, you know, look,
[01:23:41.328 --> 01:23:43.289]  The mainstream media.
[01:23:43.369 --> 01:23:44.750]  We know what you guys are up to.
[01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:45.490]  Well that's perfect.
[01:23:45.550 --> 01:23:47.832]  Link up with David Knight because he's out there.
[01:23:48.072 --> 01:23:49.693]  He's interviewing Nigel Farage right now.
[01:23:50.073 --> 01:23:54.795]  So certainly I'd like to get David Knight in there with you and we'll be going back and forth between our feeds and your feeds.
[01:23:54.875 --> 01:23:55.256]  Amazing.
[01:23:55.456 --> 01:23:57.117]  RSBN.TV.
[01:23:57.597 --> 01:23:58.798]  RSBN.TV.
[01:23:58.858 --> 01:23:59.398]  Joe Seals.
[01:23:59.918 --> 01:24:06.802]  Joe, since you mentioned it, let me play this clip of Cuomo saying you only get WikiLeaks from the media, you the citizens
[01:24:07.182 --> 01:24:12.605]  Aren't allowed to see the corruption that, by the way, CNN is involved in getting direct orders from Hillary and covering stuff up.
[01:24:12.805 --> 01:24:15.747]  So he's saying, you don't dare look at this or we'll arrest you.
[01:24:16.147 --> 01:24:17.468]  I'm a knuckle-dragging thug.
[01:24:17.888 --> 01:24:20.950]  Next day, they cut the feet on somebody talking about it.
[01:24:20.970 --> 01:24:21.390]  Here it is.
[01:24:22.271 --> 01:24:27.294]  Also interesting is, remember, it's illegal to possess these stolen documents.
[01:24:27.354 --> 01:24:28.334]  It's different for the media.
[01:24:28.354 --> 01:24:31.256]  So everything you learn about this, you're learning from us.
[01:24:31.496 --> 01:24:35.238]  And in full disclosure, let's take a look at what is in there and what it means.
[01:24:35.278 --> 01:24:36.159]  Joining us now, CNN's
[01:24:37.762 --> 01:24:43.544]  Well, on the character issue, the public, you know, two-thirds or more of the public knows that Hillary Clinton's a liar.
[01:24:44.004 --> 01:24:45.004]  She can't be trusted.
[01:24:45.044 --> 01:24:47.625]  And now the two faces of Hillary Clinton are coming out.
[01:24:47.685 --> 01:24:53.867]  The fact, through WikiLeaks, that she says one thing, and... Oh, no.
[01:24:53.887 --> 01:24:56.188]  All right, let's see if we can get Congressman Collins back.
[01:24:56.268 --> 01:24:58.069]  Obviously, we just lost his satellite feed.
[01:24:58.409 --> 01:24:58.909]  That sucks.
[01:24:59.804 --> 01:25:03.505]  By the way, folks, satellite feeds don't go dooo and put up color bars.
[01:25:03.825 --> 01:25:04.826]  That's their new thing.
[01:25:05.226 --> 01:25:08.167]  When someone doesn't like something, you just cut them off.
[01:25:08.227 --> 01:25:10.208]  So there's the congressman being cut off.
[01:25:10.248 --> 01:25:11.368]  That's why we have Right Side.
[01:25:11.588 --> 01:25:12.549]  It's why we have InfoWars.
[01:25:12.589 --> 01:25:13.389]  It's why we have Drudge.
[01:25:13.709 --> 01:25:26.514]  It's why I want everybody to start their own TV networks because out of this will come the new media based on honor and justice and freedom and liberty and hopefully never again will we rot and turn into something that makes Pravda, you know, 50 years ago look truthful.
[01:25:27.947 --> 01:25:28.527]  Absolutely.
[01:25:29.128 --> 01:25:29.788]  Absolutely.
[01:25:29.828 --> 01:25:40.533]  And I need to also, there's something else going on tonight, too, that I can't announce on air right now, but I want to talk to you about it off air, or give the information to somebody that we'll be covering also tonight, an hour before the debate.
[01:25:40.573 --> 01:25:45.855]  It's a big event that's going to take place right before the debate, about an hour before, so a press conference.
[01:25:46.565 --> 01:25:47.946]  And I want to talk to you about that on the air.
[01:25:47.966 --> 01:25:49.888]  You guys are welcome to use our feed of that as well.
[01:25:50.308 --> 01:25:50.828]  Thank you, sir.
[01:25:50.848 --> 01:25:56.933]  We're going to be going to break here in a few minutes, so I'll talk about that war game with that and our head producer, lead producer, Nico Acosta.
[01:25:57.133 --> 01:25:59.935]  So we'll talk to you in about three minutes and let you get out of here because I know you're a busy man.
[01:26:00.215 --> 01:26:07.160]  Joe Seals, RSBN TV CEO, started about 16 months ago, now reaches hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of people.
[01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:08.562]  That is totally freaking out.
[01:26:08.582 --> 01:26:15.613]  We have the head of CNN in the WikiLeaks, but also in public statements saying he should have never covered any of Trump's statements or rallies.
[01:26:15.853 --> 01:26:19.199]  So again, they're now admitting that they're trying to black this out.
[01:26:19.239 --> 01:26:21.562]  That's why what we're doing, what you're doing is so essential.
[01:26:22.879 --> 01:26:28.223]  Absolutely, and as I said before, we're completely supportive.
[01:26:28.263 --> 01:26:29.364]  This is another thing.
[01:26:30.465 --> 01:26:37.731]  For the same reason that Trump did not take donations during the primaries, he's a political outsider.
[01:26:37.771 --> 01:26:39.632]  We're media outsiders.
[01:26:39.652 --> 01:26:42.134]  I've been approached by venture capitalists.
[01:26:42.194 --> 01:26:46.358]  I've been approached by people who own bigger media companies who
[01:26:47.058 --> 01:26:47.599]  And by the way...
[01:27:06.954 --> 01:27:11.657]  That's how I started out early as well, and then I went basically to direct sales of products to fund ourselves.
[01:27:12.057 --> 01:27:13.378]  Other people are now following that model.
[01:27:13.398 --> 01:27:16.480]  I would suggest you guys do that with more than just, you know, coffee mugs or t-shirts.
[01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:17.061]  Those are great.
[01:27:17.401 --> 01:27:28.148]  I would go full-on with self-funding because, you know, during a war like this, you can get the donations you need, but during lean times, when things aren't as hot, you've got to really build the base for the next big war.
[01:27:28.829 --> 01:27:32.351]  And so that's why it's so essential people make donations there at your site.
[01:27:32.752 --> 01:27:37.108]  And support the work you're doing, because you can do so much more if more funds come in, correct?
[01:27:38.203 --> 01:28:06.526]  Absolutely, and you know, it's only because of the viewers and the donations that we're able to travel, and I tell people this all the time, that, you know, other than the YouTube ad revenue, which you know isn't that great, we are funded by people who, when they pay and they donate to us, we have a PayPal account, we have an address they can mail donations to, it all goes into one fund, and it's solely for travel, and for equipment, and purchasing, you know, so that our guys on the road can have the things that they need, and, you know,
[01:28:07.306 --> 01:28:07.886]  I understand.
[01:28:08.286 --> 01:28:12.847]  Our goal is to be relevant after November 8th, when all the Trump speeches stop.
[01:28:13.468 --> 01:28:15.108]  We're working on building a network.
[01:28:15.268 --> 01:28:18.409]  We hope to be able to work with you guys on some of that stuff.
[01:28:18.469 --> 01:28:19.809]  We're adding new shows.
[01:28:19.869 --> 01:28:21.110]  We're adding new programming.
[01:28:21.570 --> 01:28:25.751]  We have some pretty big names that are going to come to our network after the election.
[01:28:25.771 --> 01:28:30.992]  Some people that have been in the news lately that I can't talk about right now, but these people will be coming to our network.
[01:28:31.992 --> 01:28:33.053]  And having their own shows.
[01:28:33.093 --> 01:28:34.594]  We already have two shows, as you know.
[01:28:34.614 --> 01:28:40.239]  The Wayne Dupree Show, which is final cast live on RSVN, 9 o'clock Eastern Time on weekdays.
[01:28:40.299 --> 01:28:42.521]  And also, Pastor Mark Burns has a show on Sunday.
[01:28:43.162 --> 01:28:50.868]  And so, what we hope to do is to do what you guys are doing and follow your model.
[01:28:51.409 --> 01:28:57.274]  And you guys have been incredibly influential on us when we look at our business model and what we want to do.
[01:28:58.186 --> 01:29:00.148]  And so we hope that you guys will also play a part.
[01:29:28.169 --> 01:29:30.751]  I've studied history, and I've lived a lot, and I've seen a lot.
[01:29:31.211 --> 01:29:36.074]  The crop of evil we have running things right now is the most wicked, twisted threat ever.
[01:29:36.675 --> 01:29:43.679]  And that's why it's so good to just grow the resistance and be part of this, and we're so close to winning, folks, but they are coming out to the free press.
[01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:54.647]  The answer is innovate to where they can't stop us, and to support InfoWars, RightSide, Drudge, and everybody, because we are in a war for basic liberty.
[01:29:54.887 --> 01:29:57.689]  This is a complete and total survival operation.
[01:29:58.349 --> 01:29:59.251]  We're on the march.
[01:29:59.752 --> 01:30:00.513]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:00.533 --> 01:30:01.314]  It's life and death, folks.
[01:30:01.334 --> 01:30:02.215]  It's all about survival.
[01:30:02.295 --> 01:30:02.536]  Alex Jones.
[01:30:02.596 --> 01:30:03.838]  Like Trump says, it's over!
[01:30:03.858 --> 01:30:04.959]  The GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:05.019 --> 01:30:05.580]  It's over!
[01:30:06.942 --> 01:30:10.067]  If we don't stop them.
[01:30:10.207 --> 01:30:11.770]  With Mrs. Clinton, if...
[01:30:12.722 --> 01:30:25.629]  You know, what I used to say when I could talk, when I couldn't talk, is that, you know, no matter where we went, she'd come in, she'd be grateful, say thanks, thank you to the back of the house, people in the kitchen, etc.
[01:30:26.189 --> 01:30:28.230]  But that was always if there was press around.
[01:30:28.250 --> 01:30:32.012]  She's a completely different person when the camera's not on her.
[01:30:33.209 --> 01:30:34.350]  And I ran into an incident.
[01:30:34.410 --> 01:30:44.036]  I was at the Elizabeth Taylor Medical Center in Washington, D.C., and we were doing a tea with Mrs. Chirac, the former French president's wife.
[01:30:45.397 --> 01:30:56.924]  And it was just Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Chirac, and myself in the same room, and one of the people brought in something, and it did not please her, and she used the N-word very openly.
[01:30:57.659 --> 01:30:59.440]  Not just gangs of kids anymore.
[01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:03.263]  They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators.
[01:31:03.583 --> 01:31:05.284]  No conscience, no empathy.
[01:31:05.584 --> 01:31:09.427]  We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.
[01:31:09.747 --> 01:31:17.112]  Again, former top chef to the Clintons, Mr. Martin, can you walk through specifically what was happening in the conversation, what was said?
[01:31:17.132 --> 01:31:20.955]  Well, what had happened with the conversation is,
[01:31:21.850 --> 01:31:26.252]  I was just, like I said, Mrs. Chirac, Mrs. Clinton, and myself in there.
[01:31:26.272 --> 01:31:27.693]  I was just serving them tea.
[01:31:28.513 --> 01:31:33.876]  We had somebody bring in something, I think it was like some tea sandwiches or whatever, and it wasn't exactly what she wanted.
[01:31:34.416 --> 01:31:41.339]  So she tells me to tell that n-word to please, you know, leave and get what she wants.
[01:31:41.979 --> 01:31:43.360]  I mean, that's very common.
[01:31:43.939 --> 01:31:45.740]  Not just gangs of kids anymore.
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:49.561]  They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators.
[01:31:49.882 --> 01:31:51.582]  No conscience, no empathy.
[01:31:51.882 --> 01:31:55.724]  We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.
[01:31:55.744 --> 01:32:04.848]  I mean, just the demeanor and, you know, and, you know, she would write things down like that to, you know,
[01:32:06.252 --> 01:32:17.136]  She had so many handlers, and when I worked for them in Washington, I used to think to myself, you know, because the parties aside, I thought, you know, this is great.
[01:32:17.196 --> 01:32:23.739]  I'm a kid that grew up on a small farm in Chautauqua County, and here I am working for the free leader of the world.
[01:32:24.642 --> 01:32:31.652]  So you sort of out, you know, you don't look at this other small stuff, and then one day you realize, you know, they're really terrible people.
[01:32:32.013 --> 01:32:35.517]  They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators.
[01:32:35.658 --> 01:32:37.020]  We have to bring them to heal.
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:39.643]  Wow, so just to be clear, Tracy Martin.
[01:32:39.663 --> 01:32:40.505]  He's going to do it.
[01:32:41.105 --> 01:32:41.645]  Any better.
[01:32:41.665 --> 01:32:53.010]  I mean, she tells us one thing, she does something totally opposite, and now with all the WikiLeaks information coming out, everything that I've said for the last few years is all proven.
[01:32:53.431 --> 01:32:55.912]  Just like Donald Trump has said, it's all coming out.
[01:32:56.912 --> 01:33:03.875]  So, I think we've got a very, uh, I think we've got somebody saying here, we have to bring them to heel.
[01:33:03.975 --> 01:33:05.616]  Okay, we'll talk about it.
[01:33:05.796 --> 01:33:08.237]  I'm not a super predator, Hillary Clinton.
[01:33:08.257 --> 01:33:09.498]  We have to bring them to heel.
[01:33:13.393 --> 01:33:18.716]  The globalists' great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[01:33:20.257 --> 01:33:26.760]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them, on our journey to hell.
[01:33:29.081 --> 01:33:31.743]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:42.646 --> 01:33:45.751]  Only 19 days to the epic general election.
[01:33:46.351 --> 01:33:47.533]  Freedom versus tyranny.
[01:33:47.613 --> 01:33:52.820]  Nationalism versus the global scourge of the New World Order.
[01:33:53.762 --> 01:33:55.144]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:56.857 --> 01:34:01.981]  We have more of the James O'Keefe video because we got Larry Nichols on the line right now, former Clinton insider.
[01:34:02.001 --> 01:34:06.524]  Will you guys reprint me the big Inquirer article that was on Drudge yesterday?
[01:34:06.544 --> 01:34:07.865]  I want to go back over that.
[01:34:08.225 --> 01:34:09.746]  I know Nichols is one of the sources on that.
[01:34:09.766 --> 01:34:19.713]  He told us on air months ago this was coming out, but I want to get into what's going to be coming out in this issue that I get set to come out tomorrow or so, or maybe even today.
[01:34:19.733 --> 01:34:20.654]  I went and checked the
[01:34:21.738 --> 01:34:23.599]  The local grocery store and couldn't find one today.
[01:34:23.639 --> 01:34:26.860]  Maybe it's about to get stocked, but Hillary's fixer breaks ranks.
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:29.841]  I arrange sex trust for her with men and women.
[01:34:31.262 --> 01:34:36.604]  Now, I know Nichols is one of their sources on the vote rigging and bringing people around to vote ten times.
[01:34:37.904 --> 01:34:46.688]  But before we go there, it's just important to add that we now have the Democrat Party high ups on video admitting they're engaged in election fraud.
[01:34:47.932 --> 01:34:50.773]  And exactly what Larry Nichols talked about, bussing people around.
[01:34:50.793 --> 01:34:55.075]  We're going to play part of that, the latest James O'Keefe release, as well with Larry Nichols.
[01:34:55.095 --> 01:35:14.683]  But before we go there, free store-wide shipping on all items, from non-GMO heirloom seeds, to books, to films, to all the nutraceuticals, to Hillary for Prison shirts, Molon Labe shirts, store-wide free shipping for a limited time.
[01:35:16.237 --> 01:35:24.880]  We're doing this because obviously we have the final debate tonight, and it's important to get folks to try some of these amazing products.
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:31.542]  By the way, I had this idea to do it a week ago, and we already got it made, it already happened.
[01:35:31.942 --> 01:35:33.182]  Trump is my president!
[01:35:33.722 --> 01:35:37.984]  A limited edition shirt that will only be sold through the election.
[01:35:38.604 --> 01:35:41.105]  And that means you've got to order it now so you get it.
[01:35:41.165 --> 01:35:42.205]  We're 19 days out.
[01:35:43.285 --> 01:35:44.606]  Trump is my president.
[01:35:45.942 --> 01:35:51.105]  It's a red shirt so you can go to the polling place and be seen in your red shirt.
[01:35:52.266 --> 01:36:00.270]  So it's very, very clear that Trump is the winner, especially in battleground states.
[01:36:01.731 --> 01:36:07.415]  So that shirt, 1995 limited edition, is available at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:09.341 --> 01:36:13.622]  Store.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:36:13.662 --> 01:36:18.544]  No reviews because it just, I just had the idea last week, started making them last week.
[01:36:18.844 --> 01:36:20.084]  They have now been produced.
[01:36:20.144 --> 01:36:21.624]  They're now being 18 wheelered here.
[01:36:21.944 --> 01:36:24.625]  So that'll start shipping out later this week or next week.
[01:36:24.645 --> 01:36:26.246]  That's why you got to get your order in now.
[01:36:26.626 --> 01:36:27.986]  It is a total limited edition.
[01:36:28.486 --> 01:36:29.506]  In fact, I moved so quick.
[01:36:29.526 --> 01:36:30.387]  Does it have anything on the back?
[01:36:30.407 --> 01:36:30.987]  I don't think I even...
[01:36:32.015 --> 01:36:33.496]  Infowars.com legalized freedom.
[01:36:34.117 --> 01:36:34.597]  Yeah, it does.
[01:36:34.617 --> 01:36:35.238]  You don't see the back.
[01:36:35.278 --> 01:36:35.458]  Good.
[01:36:36.158 --> 01:36:36.999]  I mean so much happens.
[01:36:37.019 --> 01:36:37.479]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:36:37.539 --> 01:36:38.840]  Infowars.com legalized freedom.
[01:36:39.281 --> 01:36:46.346]  This is an absolute one-time limited edition because a lot of folks have had the idea.
[01:36:46.366 --> 01:36:54.352]  I don't even know where it came from, but to wear red, to point this out that you're red state, Infowars.com legalized freedom.
[01:36:55.447 --> 01:36:59.751]  Available at InfoWarsTore.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:36:59.791 --> 01:37:04.735]  Now we also have the last run of Hillary for Prison shirts.
[01:37:04.775 --> 01:37:07.477]  If you want to get those, they're available right now for $9.95.
[01:37:08.218 --> 01:37:11.560]  We also have Living Defense, amazing Parasite Detox.
[01:37:12.674 --> 01:37:14.896]  I don't even have time to tell you about all the specials.
[01:37:37.725 --> 01:37:39.385]  Just know these are all amazing products.
[01:37:39.785 --> 01:37:42.186]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com.
[01:37:42.846 --> 01:37:45.107]  And you heard the last fellow on from Right Side Broadcasting.
[01:37:47.627 --> 01:37:51.508]  I have everybody on who I think is pure of heart and having a big effect at taking action.
[01:37:52.649 --> 01:37:54.509]  We're going to lose if this is just about Infowars.
[01:37:55.229 --> 01:37:58.770]  We're going to lose if this is just about Drudge or Breitbart or WorldNetDaily or Daily Caller.
[01:37:59.850 --> 01:38:00.690]  And none of us are perfect.
[01:38:01.791 --> 01:38:04.971]  The Democratic Party is the leading edge of the takeover right now, worldwide.
[01:38:04.991 --> 01:38:06.792]  Trying to start a war with Russia, you name it.
[01:38:07.602 --> 01:38:12.223]  I interviewed Jill Stein a couple days ago and she concurred that they're trying to start a nuclear war.
[01:38:12.903 --> 01:38:15.684]  So, it's essential.
[01:38:25.387 --> 01:38:30.608]  The worst thing we can do around here is have them bring me jalapeno sausage during a break.
[01:38:30.628 --> 01:38:34.009]  I just want to put an article up on screen or something for a sec, please.
[01:38:39.437 --> 01:38:41.258]  I don't believe anything comes out of Hillary Clinton's mouth.
[01:38:42.699 --> 01:38:50.045]  Except that she says she has allergies, and it makes her cough, and it's been raining more than it has in decades here in Texas.
[01:38:51.826 --> 01:38:57.270]  And so we've had an incredible bloom of different plants, and I like to hike almost every morning.
[01:38:57.550 --> 01:38:58.231]  I didn't this morning.
[01:38:59.312 --> 01:39:07.478]  Let me tell you, it inflames the, I guess the bronchioles or whatever, also the esophagus, and then you get
[01:39:08.607 --> 01:39:09.027]  I don't know.
[01:39:38.666 --> 01:39:42.648]  But Larry, you keep hammering that they're going to bust people around and steal the election.
[01:39:42.948 --> 01:39:49.572]  We now have high-level Democratic Party operatives on video saying that nobody's going to enforce the law.
[01:39:49.632 --> 01:39:50.993]  We don't care if the press catches us.
[01:39:51.413 --> 01:39:52.674]  We're just going to steal this election.
[01:39:52.914 --> 01:39:55.396]  And by the way, we're going to steal all the states too and take over the country.
[01:39:55.836 --> 01:39:58.958]  And he just has this crazed power trip look in his eye.
[01:39:59.238 --> 01:40:00.539]  Who the hell are these people, Larry?
[01:40:00.559 --> 01:40:01.599]  You totally predicted this.
[01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:06.302]  Well, Alex, the people are the machine.
[01:40:06.823 --> 01:40:08.524]  They're the people behind the Clintons.
[01:40:08.744 --> 01:40:11.746]  And remember, they're the proxy group.
[01:40:11.946 --> 01:40:12.606]  They're the people.
[01:40:12.626 --> 01:40:20.191]  I heard one of the little clips and it was, that's why I know the guy was telling the truth because he said, you know, we've got these different blinds.
[01:40:20.371 --> 01:40:21.471]  It's a double blind.
[01:40:21.571 --> 01:40:23.292]  So you can't get it to Clintons.
[01:40:23.412 --> 01:40:25.314]  If somebody gets caught, well, it wasn't them.
[01:40:25.334 --> 01:40:29.796]  And they always set up people that'll fall on their sword for them.
[01:40:29.816 --> 01:40:29.856]  So,
[01:40:32.063 --> 01:40:33.184]  This is the machine.
[01:40:33.224 --> 01:40:35.085]  You know, I warned Alex.
[01:40:35.145 --> 01:40:36.626]  I tried to warn Donald Trump.
[01:40:37.026 --> 01:40:40.869]  When you start running against Hillary, the world's going to change.
[01:40:41.269 --> 01:40:45.151]  It's not going to be your world's going to come upside down.
[01:40:45.491 --> 01:40:46.572]  Well, look what's happened.
[01:40:47.413 --> 01:40:55.338]  Look at how they have done everything in their power, not just to beat him in the election, but to destroy this man.
[01:40:56.798 --> 01:40:58.139]  And they're going to cheat.
[01:40:58.259 --> 01:40:59.280]  They are going to.
[01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:00.821]  You know how I know there's going to be
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:02.620]  Massive voter fraud.
[01:41:03.041 --> 01:41:07.522]  They're forecasting, I mean, they're showing you there's going to be massive voter fraud.
[01:41:08.882 --> 01:41:12.104]  And it's the way they are lying about the polls.
[01:41:12.924 --> 01:41:19.206]  You see, they're showing Hillary way up in the polls, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 points ahead.
[01:41:19.966 --> 01:41:25.328]  And the reason they're doing that, Alex, is to justify when the actual election is run.
[01:41:26.628 --> 01:41:28.469]  If they were showing that they were dead even,
[01:41:29.324 --> 01:41:33.126]  And then all of a sudden she wins by 11 points.
[01:41:33.906 --> 01:41:35.287]  People are going to be suspect.
[01:41:36.907 --> 01:41:41.689]  But they know they're going to be bringing people in in massive numbers.
[01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:43.610]  They're going to bring them to the inner cities.
[01:41:43.630 --> 01:41:44.691]  They're going to bust them in.
[01:41:44.711 --> 01:41:45.931]  They're going to ban them in.
[01:41:46.492 --> 01:41:47.292]  And just think.
[01:41:48.038 --> 01:41:55.940]  Just think going from precinct to precinct in inner cities, bring a hundred people in and each one of them vote four or five times.
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:01.081]  Think about the massive number of votes that will accumulate.
[01:42:01.521 --> 01:42:02.502]  And you know what?
[01:42:02.582 --> 01:42:03.402]  That guy's right.
[01:42:04.162 --> 01:42:05.442]  We don't care if we get caught.
[01:42:05.742 --> 01:42:08.123]  Number one, is the media going to say anything about it?
[01:42:08.563 --> 01:42:09.943]  No, they've proven that.
[01:42:10.544 --> 01:42:15.145]  Number two, who are you going to call in the Justice Department to do anything about it?
[01:42:15.705 --> 01:42:16.125]  No one.
[01:42:17.148 --> 01:42:18.269]  They've already proven that.
[01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:21.052]  You know, people have no idea, Alex.
[01:42:21.092 --> 01:42:34.005]  When Hillary, if she gets elected, and I still pray to high heaven she does not, but if she gets elected within 90 days of the day she's sworn in, this country will be changed forever.
[01:42:34.365 --> 01:42:34.885]  Forever.
[01:42:35.831 --> 01:42:43.453]  Because they will use blackmail and extortion on every governor, every lieutenant governor, every congressman, every senator.
[01:42:43.913 --> 01:42:47.854]  Well that's what Scott Fogle says on the tape, and he's the national director.
[01:42:48.475 --> 01:42:52.816]  He starts salivating and says, and next we're taking over the legislatures.
[01:42:54.136 --> 01:42:54.556]  They will.
[01:42:55.156 --> 01:42:55.797]  They will indeed.
[01:42:56.477 --> 01:42:59.137]  Now let me, may I give just a quick example of a poll?
[01:42:59.498 --> 01:42:59.758]  Yes.
[01:42:59.838 --> 01:43:00.898]  Show that you've got proof.
[01:43:02.150 --> 01:43:05.092]  Yesterday, I couldn't help but notice, here comes a poll on Fox.
[01:43:05.472 --> 01:43:08.013]  And it's by Wall Street Journal and NBC.
[01:43:09.013 --> 01:43:13.895]  And the reporter on Fox, or the host, was saying, you know, this is a good poll.
[01:43:13.975 --> 01:43:17.097]  Basically, he was saying it was the gold standard of polls.
[01:43:17.157 --> 01:43:19.758]  Well, I went and looked at the internals of that poll.
[01:43:20.838 --> 01:43:22.399]  You see, Alex, people don't do this.
[01:43:22.839 --> 01:43:26.081]  But you go in and it said they had interviewed 905 people.
[01:43:29.961 --> 01:43:34.325]  And that it had a plus or minus accuracy of 3.2%.
[01:43:34.685 --> 01:43:40.189]  Well, that's funny, because when you look inside, there are three categories of respondents to a poll.
[01:43:40.449 --> 01:43:43.272]  Number one is a hang-up, that somebody hangs up and doesn't take it.
[01:43:43.772 --> 01:43:47.235]  Number two is interview.
[01:43:47.815 --> 01:43:53.520]  Interview means, folks, somebody that started out taking the poll, but then for whatever reason quit.
[01:43:54.443 --> 01:43:55.904]  And then you have respondents.
[01:43:56.124 --> 01:44:00.705]  Now, respondents are the only people, Alex, you count in a poll.
[01:44:01.145 --> 01:44:02.906]  Statistically, that's it.
[01:44:03.026 --> 01:44:09.228]  And a respondent is somebody that answers 90% or better of the questions in the survey.
[01:44:10.249 --> 01:44:15.871]  Now, do you have any... Now, 905, you know, nationwide, that's not a very big sample anyway.
[01:44:16.371 --> 01:44:19.312]  But do you know how many people actually were respondents? 492.
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:37.669]  492.
[01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:37.669]  When you use the standard basis by figuring margin of error, that puts it at 6 point margin of error plus, which means statistically that poll is zipped.
[01:44:37.769 --> 01:44:48.475]  But I mean for me that is a gold standard compared to the other ones where they'll get 40, 50, 60, 70 percent more Democrats in the sample than they do Republicans and they admit in the methodology they're doing that.
[01:44:48.495 --> 01:44:49.296]  This is ridiculous.
[01:44:49.796 --> 01:44:51.497]  Well, that's what they did in this poll.
[01:44:51.557 --> 01:45:05.521]  When you look at the poll, what you find out is 60% of the people that completed in that 492, 60% of them were, guess what, Democrats, to 40% Republicans.
[01:45:05.541 --> 01:45:07.422]  And how do you get them to get the Republicans to hang up?
[01:45:07.482 --> 01:45:11.263]  I'll tell you, it's on record that I've got a few of these over the years.
[01:45:11.323 --> 01:45:14.685]  As soon as you start answering the way they don't want, it just disconnects.
[01:45:14.745 --> 01:45:15.625]  The phone disconnects.
[01:45:15.685 --> 01:45:18.266]  That's how they kick you out, and that's how they get more Democrats.
[01:45:18.786 --> 01:45:23.468]  That's how you find out what happened to that 400 that they started out interviewing.
[01:45:24.288 --> 01:45:29.390]  Most of the time you would think that 400 would be people that hang up on the interviewer.
[01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:30.130]  No.
[01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:34.752]  What happened when somebody gives the answer they don't like, they hang up on them.
[01:45:35.379 --> 01:45:35.919]  They hang up.
[01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:37.620]  Now, it's linear.
[01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:43.363]  Every question in that poll that related to, do you want Hillary or Trump?
[01:45:43.923 --> 01:45:48.245]  Do you think Hillary's a better leader than Trump or Trump a better leader?
[01:45:48.525 --> 01:45:50.706]  Every question that was relevant, guess what?
[01:45:50.726 --> 01:45:50.746]  60-40.
[01:45:50.766 --> 01:45:51.186]  60-40.
[01:45:51.206 --> 01:45:51.226]  60-40.
[01:45:56.301 --> 01:45:59.142]  I'm telling you, the polls are rigged.
[01:45:59.422 --> 01:46:04.324]  Well Larry, that's indisputed because that's how I was able to finish your sentence even though I hadn't seen this particular poll.
[01:46:04.644 --> 01:46:06.025]  They've gone to a new level of fraud.
[01:46:06.085 --> 01:46:09.386]  Normally they would have the independent vote, really know those were Democrats.
[01:46:10.521 --> 01:46:11.661]  Skew it by demographics.
[01:46:12.442 --> 01:46:16.863]  Or CNN just says, call us if you want to be in the poll, then they cherry pick who they want.
[01:46:16.883 --> 01:46:21.205]  So there's different ways to do it, but only two or three different ways, as you know, as an expert that was involved in this.
[01:46:21.885 --> 01:46:28.927]  My question is, what are they going to do when the internal polls show Trump 5 to 15 points ahead, depending on which battleground state you're in?
[01:46:29.187 --> 01:46:33.389]  That's why he's saying it's rigged, because his internal polls show he's still ahead
[01:46:33.769 --> 01:46:40.054]  He did lose some in this big scandal, but when he came out swinging last week and did a good job of the debate, he stabilized.
[01:46:40.334 --> 01:46:43.096]  So he knows he really should win in a landslide.
[01:46:43.396 --> 01:46:44.897]  He knows they have illegals voting.
[01:46:44.937 --> 01:46:46.879]  He knows they have dead people voting.
[01:46:47.239 --> 01:46:48.860]  So, what does he do in the debate tonight?
[01:46:49.921 --> 01:46:57.186]  What he has to do in the debate tonight, and I went on YouTube and just made a public thing to Trump, telling him what I think he should do.
[01:46:57.747 --> 01:46:59.107]  Alex, he has no choice.
[01:46:59.288 --> 01:47:00.969]  Tonight, when he gets on that stage,
[01:47:01.833 --> 01:47:07.457]  Although Chris Wallace seems to be applicable, here's what Trump has to do.
[01:47:07.718 --> 01:47:14.483]  When he gets on that stage, he needs to close his eyes, Alex, and pretend there's nobody in that room, no interviewer, no Hillary.
[01:47:14.943 --> 01:47:21.748]  And when he gets two minutes, he needs to start talking about whatever the issue is he wants to talk about.
[01:47:21.768 --> 01:47:24.730]  He needs to say, I want to talk directly to the American people.
[01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:25.351]  There you go.
[01:47:25.411 --> 01:47:28.793]  And say, if you're tired of the past and being ripped off and all the corruption,
[01:47:29.781 --> 01:47:33.143]  You've seen all the rigging and the fake polls, the demonization of lies.
[01:47:33.703 --> 01:47:37.265]  If you want a real change, the whole establishment's against me.
[01:47:37.605 --> 01:47:38.806]  You've never seen anything like this.
[01:47:38.846 --> 01:47:41.508]  It's because they've got it rigged, a bunch of insiders.
[01:47:42.563 --> 01:47:43.644]  I'm going to bring in term limits.
[01:47:43.984 --> 01:47:45.065]  I'm going to cut your taxes.
[01:47:46.005 --> 01:47:48.127]  It's basic stuff that will bring this country back.
[01:47:48.147 --> 01:47:54.471]  If you want to go with the old mafia, you want to buy their lies, you go ahead and vote for this lady right here.
[01:47:54.731 --> 01:47:58.474]  But I'm here to tell you, our internal polls show I'm way ahead.
[01:47:58.754 --> 01:48:06.019]  Then they've got these polls where they sample 30, 40, 50, 60 percent more Democrats in the poll and then say that I'm losing.
[01:48:06.299 --> 01:48:11.162]  Folks, the fix is in and I'm asking the American people, I've been fighting for you, but you've got to fight for me.
[01:48:11.422 --> 01:48:12.223]  We're in this together.
[01:48:12.643 --> 01:48:18.485]  That's right, and he's got to look right at the camera, and when they start hollering at him, Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, answer the questions.
[01:48:18.545 --> 01:48:19.665]  Don't even hear them.
[01:48:19.965 --> 01:48:21.786]  Go on and finish your statement.
[01:48:22.226 --> 01:48:24.867]  Look, somebody's going to say, well, that's not fair.
[01:48:25.047 --> 01:48:28.988]  Let me tell you, this gathering tonight is not going to be fair.
[01:48:29.468 --> 01:48:32.189]  If he whips Hillary every way but loose,
[01:48:32.964 --> 01:48:35.086]  The media is going to spin it the next day.
[01:48:35.126 --> 01:48:37.487]  You saw it happen with the second debate, Alex.
[01:48:37.587 --> 01:48:39.289]  The next day, the media is going to say, lost.
[01:48:39.809 --> 01:48:44.792]  The next day, the media is going to pull snippets out, and they're going to spin them the way they want to.
[01:48:44.852 --> 01:48:46.814]  So he's up against a stacked deck.
[01:48:47.174 --> 01:48:48.035]  Have courage.
[01:48:48.255 --> 01:48:49.516]  Look into that camera.
[01:48:49.576 --> 01:48:55.340]  Realize this is the last chance, Alex, he has to talk to 50 to 60 million Americans.
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:58.042]  And tell the American people it's their last chance.
[01:48:58.342 --> 01:48:58.822]  That's right.
[01:48:58.882 --> 01:49:13.210]  And point Hillary and say you're a communist Chinese agent, you've been exposed with the shadow government, the WikiLeaks have destroyed you, you tried to bribe the FBI to say you didn't have classified documents, you should be in handcuffs right now for criminal espionage and racketeering.
[01:49:13.230 --> 01:49:17.393]  But since you mentioned it, here's the Project Veritas talking to the head.
[01:49:18.727 --> 01:49:25.109]  Of people for the American Way, the main Democrat organization out there getting voters, Scott Fovle admitting the buses.
[01:49:25.129 --> 01:49:25.589]  Here it is.
[01:49:25.869 --> 01:49:26.569]  You know what?
[01:49:26.589 --> 01:49:32.391]  We've been busing people in for 50 years, and we're not going to stop now.
[01:49:32.931 --> 01:49:39.193]  This is part two of our undercover investigation into the dark backroom dealings of the Hillary Clinton campaign.
[01:49:40.113 --> 01:49:46.377]  Part 1 blew up on social media, with many Americans wondering why the mainstream media wasn't covering the story.
[01:49:47.298 --> 01:49:51.460]  In fact, Project Veritas Action had television exclusives lined up around the country.
[01:49:52.461 --> 01:49:55.463]  Those television stations spiked the story at the last minute.
[01:49:56.363 --> 01:50:03.388]  Our sources tell us the reason they did so was fear of retaliation and retribution from a future Hillary Clinton administration.
[01:50:04.108 --> 01:50:06.790]  Truth is dangerous, especially
[01:50:07.551 --> 01:50:08.832]  When it challenges those in power.
[01:50:09.152 --> 01:50:09.452]  Alright.
[01:50:09.993 --> 01:50:10.993]  And then he goes on from there.
[01:50:11.093 --> 01:50:15.296]  So they're on video bragging and later he says, nobody's going to stop us.
[01:50:15.316 --> 01:50:15.937]  There is no law.
[01:50:15.977 --> 01:50:16.818]  We run everything now.
[01:50:17.158 --> 01:50:18.919]  We've reached the tyranny tipping point.
[01:50:19.179 --> 01:50:19.680]  Larry Nichols.
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:20.480]  Yes.
[01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:25.924]  You know, Alex, you and I talked some months ago now about we are in a velvet coup.
[01:50:26.542 --> 01:50:29.247]  We are actually in a coup d'etat.
[01:50:29.848 --> 01:50:37.723]  As a matter of fact, the other night I heard Newt Gingrich, he was quoting some friend of his that wrote an article and said, Newt Gingrich said, we are in a coup d'etat.
[01:50:38.364 --> 01:50:38.785]  He said it.
[01:50:39.494 --> 01:50:41.916]  They are taking it over unless we stand up.
[01:50:42.016 --> 01:50:44.658]  That's why Trump has got to come forward tonight.
[01:50:45.219 --> 01:50:46.420]  And he's got to tell it.
[01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:47.861]  He's got to tell it all.
[01:50:47.901 --> 01:50:49.262]  You know, the Russian thing.
[01:50:49.322 --> 01:50:54.626]  He needs to say, hey folks, they're claiming that WikiLeaks is Russia and I'm their big buddy.
[01:50:54.726 --> 01:50:57.849]  Let me ask you this, to a sane, rational human being.
[01:50:58.349 --> 01:51:05.035]  If you were Putin, then here is Donald Trump that's going to beef up our military, bring the military back to what it should be in the world.
[01:51:05.055 --> 01:51:05.475]  Stay right there.
[01:51:05.495 --> 01:51:06.136]  Stay right there.
[01:51:06.236 --> 01:51:06.576]  Absolutely.
[01:51:07.197 --> 01:51:07.517]  Stay there.
[01:51:10.342 --> 01:51:17.684]  Tonight, tune into InfoWars.com forward slash show for live coverage of the big, epic last debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
[01:51:17.844 --> 01:51:19.644]  We're starting our pre-debate show at 3 p.m.
[01:51:19.684 --> 01:51:21.705]  Central, right after the main transmission.
[01:51:21.805 --> 01:51:24.846]  So if you're already watching the Alex Jones Show, just continue watching.
[01:51:25.046 --> 01:51:25.566]  At 7 p.m.
[01:51:25.606 --> 01:51:27.806]  Central, we'll go over what to watch for during the debate.
[01:51:28.126 --> 01:51:29.687]  And the debate starts at 8 p.m.
[01:51:29.747 --> 01:51:30.087]  Central.
[01:51:30.267 --> 01:51:37.635]  Now this debate is not just about Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton, but rather it's about how the shadow government is finally uncloaking before our very eyes to destroy U.S.
[01:51:37.655 --> 01:51:38.116]  sovereignty.
[01:51:38.196 --> 01:51:46.325]  The latest WikiLeaks emails reveal the inner workings of the global elite who are forging an authoritarian society dominated by technocrats and government technology and media.
[01:51:46.445 --> 01:51:50.688]  Whose claim to power rests solely on their arrogant belief they are superior to the rest of society.
[01:51:50.788 --> 01:51:54.210]  These elites stay in control using military conflict, which begs the question.
[01:51:54.330 --> 01:51:55.351]  Will they force the U.S.
[01:51:55.431 --> 01:51:56.852]  into a nuclear war with Russia?
[01:51:56.912 --> 01:52:00.214]  Will 2017 mark the beginnings of global tyranny or the renaissance of liberty?
[01:52:00.314 --> 01:52:05.057]  Again, tune in to InfoWars.com forward slash show tonight for live debate coverage starting at 3 p.m.
[01:52:05.097 --> 01:52:06.778]  Central with the debate at 8 p.m.
[01:52:06.818 --> 01:52:07.139]  Central.
[01:52:07.159 --> 01:52:08.359]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:13.906]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[01:52:14.006 --> 01:52:24.940]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:30.022]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[01:52:30.142 --> 01:52:32.664]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[01:52:32.724 --> 01:52:34.204]  It helps detoxify.
[01:52:34.444 --> 01:52:37.266]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[01:52:37.326 --> 01:52:42.068]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[01:52:42.088 --> 01:52:46.230]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[01:52:46.650 --> 01:52:48.272]  ...dependent upon selenium.
[01:52:48.292 --> 01:52:53.657]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[01:52:53.777 --> 01:52:55.199]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[01:52:55.399 --> 01:52:56.120]  This is so key.
[01:52:56.380 --> 01:53:00.685]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[01:53:00.705 --> 01:53:02.807]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[01:53:02.927 --> 01:53:06.390]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.

[01:53:14.219 --> 01:53:16.402]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:53:16.502 --> 01:53:23.331]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[01:53:23.551 --> 01:53:26.835]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[01:53:26.855 --> 01:53:27.997]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[01:53:28.297 --> 01:53:34.703]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[01:53:34.943 --> 01:53:35.744]  This is sustainable.
[01:53:35.884 --> 01:53:39.868]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[01:53:40.068 --> 01:53:43.251]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[01:53:43.291 --> 01:53:46.314]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[01:53:46.374 --> 01:53:47.854]  We're looking at the television screen.
[01:53:47.894 --> 01:53:53.596]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:53:53.636 --> 01:53:58.797]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com.
[01:53:58.997 --> 01:53:59.597]  Or call 888-253-3139.

[01:54:02.378 --> 01:54:03.458]  And we thank you for your support.
[01:54:10.447 --> 01:54:15.589]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:16.269 --> 01:54:18.610]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:54:18.630 --> 01:54:21.170]  All right, Larry Nichols is our guest.
[01:54:21.230 --> 01:54:24.551]  I want to get with him some of this big Inquirer piece.
[01:54:25.112 --> 01:54:26.692]  The WikiLeaks are so devastating.
[01:54:27.372 --> 01:54:32.834]  The whole world is turning against Hillary and this crime syndicate because they know how dangerous she is.
[01:54:33.374 --> 01:54:35.555]  We're getting into the fact that he's going to be of our military.
[01:54:36.435 --> 01:54:39.117]  Um, why then would Russia be more pro-Trump?
[01:54:39.137 --> 01:54:42.479]  Well, because they understand how dangerous Hillary and the neocons are.
[01:54:43.119 --> 01:54:49.763]  Hillary, now it turns out in the WikiLeaks that the FBI was investigating her for stealing furniture from the State Department.
[01:54:49.803 --> 01:54:53.205]  I mean, these people are incredible, stingy, trashy people.
[01:54:53.726 --> 01:54:54.966]  I wanted to ask you about this, though.
[01:54:56.107 --> 01:54:58.769]  We have the chef on, yesterday.
[01:55:00.086 --> 01:55:13.429]  For the Clintons, who worked for them for a very long time, and he said that they would call black servers the N-word, they would call Hispanics names, but they would call other people names, and that also she wrote lots of notes calling people the N-word.
[01:55:13.449 --> 01:55:17.170]  A former Clinton chef, again that's up on Infowars.com, Tracy Martin.
[01:55:17.691 --> 01:55:21.272]  Larry Nichols, your experiences, what type of stuff did you ever hear come out of their mouths?
[01:55:22.132 --> 01:55:26.893]  Well, let's see, how about calling Dickie Morris, that little fat Jew bastard,
[01:55:27.705 --> 01:55:38.094]  How about every black person that came in, specifically one guy that was kind of famous at the time, what was his name, the head of the Rainbow Coalition?
[01:55:39.335 --> 01:55:40.036]  Jesse Jackson.
[01:55:40.316 --> 01:55:41.317]  Jesse Jackson.
[01:55:41.517 --> 01:55:45.200]  They called him the N-word, left and right.
[01:55:46.041 --> 01:55:49.584]  And he and his N-word organization
[01:55:50.458 --> 01:55:50.738]  Yeah.
[01:55:51.179 --> 01:55:52.240]  No, I've heard them.
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:55.705]  Well, you don't have to be around them long until you'll hear that and worse.
[01:55:55.865 --> 01:55:59.049]  Ask anybody that was working with the Clintons when they were president.
[01:55:59.490 --> 01:56:07.701]  Ask the people that were walking up and down the halls in the White House when Hillary would come by and they'd jump in a closet not to have to pass her.
[01:56:08.959 --> 01:56:09.199]  No.
[01:56:09.679 --> 01:56:11.080]  No, don't tell me.
[01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:11.860]  Well, let's expand on that.
[01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:22.426]  I've talked to people that were there, that Jesse Jackson, when he had to bring women or kids around Bill, that he would like say, watch out, now watch out, he'll grab you, and then he was actually scared of them.
[01:56:22.446 --> 01:56:23.486]  Well, absolutely.
[01:56:23.806 --> 01:56:28.228]  And Ron Brown, you know, the head of commerce, killed out in the plane crash.
[01:56:28.789 --> 01:56:29.389]  Would you know?
[01:56:29.669 --> 01:56:32.951]  Do you know why Ron Brown got to be the head of the Commerce Department?
[01:56:33.671 --> 01:56:37.653]  Because Bill Clinton had accosted his daughter, his 16-year-old daughter.
[01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:43.293]  And Ron Brown found out about it, well, then he gave him that appointment to cool him down.
[01:56:43.313 --> 01:56:45.975]  I mean, these people are scum, Alex.
[01:56:46.055 --> 01:57:02.767]  I've told you, we've told people, we've done everything we can to warn people, but they have got Joseph Gerbel working for them, just as if he were sitting in those offices because they're doing just what we did when I was with them.
[01:57:03.499 --> 01:57:11.665]  You get control of the media, Alex, and you keep telling the American people everything that you said over and over and over.
[01:57:12.186 --> 01:57:16.369]  I was about to say, when you see the head and the deputy head
[01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:17.990]  I'm
[01:57:34.525 --> 01:57:37.226]  Stealing furniture out of the State Department.
[01:57:37.266 --> 01:57:42.809]  Don't you recall when they left the White House, when George Bush was good enough to let them take Air Force Two?
[01:57:43.390 --> 01:57:45.751]  They stole stuff out of the White House.
[01:57:45.771 --> 01:57:47.292]  Stole Washington's China.
[01:57:47.452 --> 01:57:51.954]  They got fined $50,000 and had to bring the stuff back.
[01:57:52.114 --> 01:57:52.614]  No, I know.
[01:57:52.895 --> 01:57:58.117]  These are literally the daughter of an organized crime chief and a white trash scumbag.
[01:57:58.137 --> 01:58:00.198]  I can't believe it.
[01:58:01.019 --> 01:58:02.940]  Well, but you have to believe it.
[01:58:03.490 --> 01:58:04.531]  You have to believe it.
[01:58:04.891 --> 01:58:06.232]  All of you have to know.
[01:58:06.392 --> 01:58:08.994]  And that's one of the things Trump needs to say tonight.
[01:58:09.454 --> 01:58:12.256]  Look, they say that I'm against all of Islam.
[01:58:12.336 --> 01:58:14.057]  Now, personally, Alex, I am.
[01:58:14.177 --> 01:58:14.778]  But that's me.
[01:58:14.878 --> 01:58:15.618]  That's not Trump.
[01:58:16.178 --> 01:58:18.960]  And then he needs to say, ladies and gentlemen, you know what I said?
[01:58:18.980 --> 01:58:30.588]  I said as long as we're bringing people in from Syria that cannot possibly be vetted, what I said was we need to halt all of that until we get a system that can properly vet them.
[01:58:30.848 --> 01:58:38.633]  I want to ask you, because you've been proven totally right, the next 19 days, what they're going to do, what Trump needs to do, and more about the latest Inquirer information.
[01:58:38.673 --> 01:58:40.895]  But clearly, they're going to try to steal it.
[01:58:40.955 --> 01:58:42.035]  How do we counter that?
[01:58:43.016 --> 01:58:45.117]  Wow, what a time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:45.798 --> 01:58:46.638]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:46.658 --> 01:58:47.079]  Stay with us.
[01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:52.842]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:52.882 --> 01:58:54.844]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:59.497 --> 01:59:02.859]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.
[01:59:03.079 --> 01:59:04.760]  Minor words and his was action.
[01:59:05.341 --> 01:59:06.882]  His was what he's done to women.
[01:59:06.922 --> 01:59:12.585]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[01:59:12.805 --> 01:59:15.127]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[01:59:15.487 --> 01:59:21.671]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously, four of them here tonight.
[01:59:21.791 --> 01:59:27.094]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[01:59:37.932 --> 01:59:40.654]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[01:59:41.534 --> 01:59:42.975]  It's a fight for our minds.
[01:59:43.656 --> 01:59:45.577]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.

[01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:53.602]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[01:59:53.682 --> 01:59:55.263]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.

[02:00:00.986 --> 02:00:03.628]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:20.174 --> 02:00:22.336]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:22.436 --> 02:00:27.919]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[02:00:34.855 --> 02:00:35.995]  Larry Nichols is our guest.
[02:00:37.336 --> 02:00:44.178]  Larry, we have the head of the New York elections, a Democrat, admitting fraud is going on, with people being bussed around the vote ten times.
[02:00:45.199 --> 02:00:53.622]  We have the national coordinator for the Democrats, met 340 times at the White House, admitting it and just openly saying, F them, we're taking over.
[02:00:53.682 --> 02:00:56.323]  I mean, it's very mafia, it's very aggressive.
[02:00:56.683 --> 02:00:59.084]  We played most of it in the first hour, it's up on Infowars.com.
[02:01:02.185 --> 02:01:03.005]  How do we stop them?
[02:01:03.085 --> 02:01:10.888]  And then if they do get in, they do have that criminal energy now in their eyes that I've seen in old film footage of communists and Nazis and stuff.
[02:01:11.269 --> 02:01:13.109]  They're going to make a crazed run, everybody.
[02:01:13.149 --> 02:01:20.772]  So all I can say is, boy, folks, I'm glad we got the Second Amendment to defend ourselves because they think nothing's there to stop them.
[02:01:20.792 --> 02:01:21.633]  They're going to go crazy.
[02:01:22.993 --> 02:01:23.573]  Absolutely.
[02:01:23.633 --> 02:01:25.954]  I'll tell you how to stop them right now.
[02:01:25.994 --> 02:01:27.215]  Now, folks, please hear me.
[02:01:27.815 --> 02:01:29.996]  All of you fellow veterans,
[02:01:31.776 --> 02:01:34.917]  I need veterans organizations to gather up teams.
[02:01:35.317 --> 02:01:38.838]  And you need to go to the inner city precincts in your town.
[02:01:39.639 --> 02:01:40.339]  Your community.
[02:01:41.759 --> 02:01:42.880]  5, 6, 7, 8 of you.
[02:01:42.900 --> 02:01:45.240]  Because this is the true final defense of the Republic.
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:46.641]  More than any foreign land.
[02:01:46.801 --> 02:01:47.181]  This is it.
[02:01:47.261 --> 02:01:47.881]  Absolutely.
[02:01:48.141 --> 02:01:49.242]  Now, you go in there.
[02:01:49.542 --> 02:01:50.862]  It's not hard to spot.
[02:01:50.942 --> 02:01:52.343]  You'll see vans come up.
[02:01:52.423 --> 02:01:53.683]  You'll see buses come up.
[02:01:53.783 --> 02:01:57.944]  And you'll see the same people going in and out of that precinct over and over and over.
[02:01:58.485 --> 02:01:59.445]  When you see it,
[02:02:00.399 --> 02:02:04.463]  And the reason I say eight or ten of you go in there, because it's going to be a little risky.
[02:02:05.243 --> 02:02:08.066]  You're going into the heart of the ghettos of these communities.
[02:02:08.506 --> 02:02:08.986]  They know it.
[02:02:09.307 --> 02:02:10.267]  They know you won't go.
[02:02:10.288 --> 02:02:12.109]  But veterans, go.
[02:02:12.329 --> 02:02:13.570]  Get your teams together.
[02:02:13.670 --> 02:02:14.171]  Go in.
[02:02:14.331 --> 02:02:15.392]  And when you see it,
[02:02:16.241 --> 02:02:21.884]  Instantly, that minute, record it on your phone, take a picture or two, and then call me.
[02:02:22.505 --> 02:02:24.826]  Call me, I'll get the word out instantly.
[02:02:25.086 --> 02:02:26.767]  We gotta catch them in real time.
[02:02:26.907 --> 02:02:28.088]  That's what you gotta do.
[02:02:28.208 --> 02:02:44.237]  Now, when it comes to the push-button machines, the touch voting machines, Alex, guys, everybody, when you go in and the voting machine is push-button, touch machine, you make them show you a printed
[02:02:45.225 --> 02:02:48.806]  Proof of your votes being registered the way you cast them.
[02:02:49.346 --> 02:02:55.888]  And if they can't do that, or tell you they can't do that, then you demand to have a paper ballot.
[02:02:56.808 --> 02:02:58.889]  Every place is supposed to have a paper ballot.
[02:02:58.909 --> 02:03:00.489]  In fact, demand them by law, they're supposed to have it.
[02:03:00.529 --> 02:03:02.070]  In fact, just demand one every time.
[02:03:03.310 --> 02:03:10.912]  Now, if they say, well, we don't have paper ballots here, which is against the law, but they'll say that probably, then it's simple.
[02:03:11.798 --> 02:03:14.065]  They'll tell you you need to go then to the...
[02:03:17.689 --> 02:03:20.711]  City or the county courthouse, wherever the main place is.
[02:03:20.751 --> 02:03:24.713]  There's a place you can go and get a paper ballot and cast your vote.
[02:03:25.033 --> 02:03:34.359]  But if they will not provide you proof on a touchscreen computerized voting machine which is owned by DieVote, which is owned by George Soros.
[02:03:34.419 --> 02:03:38.901]  By the way, exactly more than half the ballots in the country are getting cast on companies he controls.
[02:03:39.762 --> 02:03:41.463]  Absolutely, so I'm just telling you.
[02:03:41.583 --> 02:03:41.983]  Bastard.
[02:03:42.283 --> 02:03:43.324]  You can do it.
[02:03:43.844 --> 02:03:45.545]  You can do it, but you gotta do it in Alex.
[02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:51.343]  We forewarned, we forewarned, and it is now here.
[02:03:51.663 --> 02:04:01.511]  This is the vote that either wins our country back, or at least protects it for a while longer, or we give it all up.
[02:04:01.631 --> 02:04:04.453]  Now, if she wins, you say, what do you do then?
[02:04:04.473 --> 02:04:08.756]  You know, he's talking about doing term limits.
[02:04:09.403 --> 02:04:11.465]  You know Alex, Congress isn't going to vote for that.
[02:04:11.525 --> 02:04:14.146]  You'd have to get a constitutional amendment.
[02:04:14.467 --> 02:04:16.808]  You know it takes two thirds of the state to vote for that.
[02:04:16.968 --> 02:04:21.412]  We're almost out of time Larry, but I want to invite you back up for part two of this tomorrow if you can do it.
[02:04:21.432 --> 02:04:27.836]  Folks can support you at NicholsLiveAtAOL.com, the important work you're doing, the organization you've got set up.
[02:04:28.197 --> 02:04:29.578]  NicholsLiveAtAOL.com.
[02:04:29.898 --> 02:04:37.643]  Let's get you to pop back in for 30 minutes tomorrow to talk about what we do, how we identify fraud, how we stop it, and then what is going to happen if Hillary gets in?
[02:04:38.604 --> 02:04:44.689]  Trump's going to win, folks, but they're going to try to steal the ballot box or announce federally, Homeland Security taking over, that he's lost.
[02:04:45.729 --> 02:04:47.111]  But we've won by exposing him.
[02:04:47.151 --> 02:04:48.632]  We've certainly exposed their operation.
[02:04:48.652 --> 02:04:51.294]  So, you know, we only lose by laying down.
[02:04:51.334 --> 02:04:52.515]  Larry Nichols, thank you so much.
[02:04:52.555 --> 02:04:53.676]  And you've been... You bet, buddy.
[02:04:53.936 --> 02:04:54.496]  You know what?
[02:04:54.556 --> 02:04:55.677]  I've got Gary Haven coming up.
[02:04:56.017 --> 02:04:56.738]  Is he still in Haiti?
[02:04:58.699 --> 02:05:03.403]  I don't think he's going to mind getting backed up a few minutes because I need to get into this Haiti thing.
[02:05:03.423 --> 02:05:07.226]  But I also need to ask Larry one more question about this whole thing.
[02:05:09.056 --> 02:05:10.478]  I said to Donald, here's what they're doing.
[02:05:10.498 --> 02:05:11.799]  They're setting it up as follows.
[02:05:12.419 --> 02:05:15.583]  For three, four months they've been saying the Russians are hacking our elections.
[02:05:16.323 --> 02:05:20.367]  To protect our elections, which are sacred, we want to turn it over to DHS.
[02:05:20.387 --> 02:05:24.311]  The genius has given us one terrorist attack after another and has done nothing to stop it.
[02:05:24.331 --> 02:05:25.352]  He still has his job, right?
[02:05:25.873 --> 02:05:28.335]  So he wants to now make sure our elections are safe.
[02:05:28.656 --> 02:05:29.456]  Russians are hacking.
[02:05:30.177 --> 02:05:31.298]  Follow the bouncing ball.
[02:05:31.358 --> 02:05:31.938]  No proof.
[02:05:32.318 --> 02:05:50.370]  If Trump wins, which is highly likely by the way, which we can talk about in a minute or two or another time, Trump wins, government declares, oh we have evidence that the Russians hacked it, he's a friend of Putin, the election is null and void, we're going to recall another election in what, six months?
[02:05:50.430 --> 02:05:53.492]  Until then, Mr. Obama has graciously agreed
[02:05:54.452 --> 02:05:57.753]  To continue his public service in the United States of America.
[02:05:58.073 --> 02:05:58.873]  Thank you very much.
[02:05:58.933 --> 02:06:00.054]  We're not taking any questions.
[02:06:00.094 --> 02:06:00.554]  Goodbye.
[02:06:02.654 --> 02:06:11.337]  And we have Biden announcing they're going to launch a giant cyber attack on the Russians and saying if the Russians respond, they may respond militarily, which is a doctrine Hillary came out with two months ago.
[02:06:11.737 --> 02:06:14.017]  And suddenly NATO announced that's their new doctrine.
[02:06:14.257 --> 02:06:15.718]  She's literally calling the show.
[02:06:17.065 --> 02:06:19.946]  All I wanted to say was, I said it to Donald and he didn't take the bait.
[02:06:19.966 --> 02:06:20.547]  I'm glad he didn't.
[02:06:20.627 --> 02:06:24.008]  I said, don't even answer me because they'll crucify you if you agree with me.
[02:06:25.009 --> 02:06:26.730]  They're going to steal the election.
[02:06:26.890 --> 02:06:27.670]  I'll make it simple.
[02:06:27.730 --> 02:06:30.471]  In the fifth grade, I ran for class president in Queens, New York.
[02:06:31.472 --> 02:06:32.412]  I was a funny kid.
[02:06:32.452 --> 02:06:33.313]  I was a wild kid.
[02:06:33.333 --> 02:06:34.093]  I was out of control.
[02:06:34.153 --> 02:06:35.674]  I won the election by a landslide.
[02:06:36.214 --> 02:06:40.076]  The teacher stood up and said, this election doesn't count.
[02:06:40.716 --> 02:06:43.620]  She had another election, and I wasn't class president.
[02:06:44.040 --> 02:06:48.745]  So, hey, look, if it could be done in the fifth grade in the Bronx when I was a kid, why can't they do it to us now, right?
[02:06:48.785 --> 02:06:49.446]  We're just children.
[02:06:49.466 --> 02:06:51.068]  I had a similar thing happen.
[02:06:51.088 --> 02:06:57.875]  You know, when you really do things in this world, you start to learn how rigged they are, and it's just crazy to see them go, even though they're the same newscast.
[02:06:58.576 --> 02:06:59.897]  The Russians are rigging the election.
[02:07:00.217 --> 02:07:02.158]  We're having to bring in the UN to oversee it.
[02:07:02.198 --> 02:07:03.578]  And then meanwhile, Trump's crazy.
[02:07:03.838 --> 02:07:07.300]  He says they're rigging the election, even as we catch election officials admitting the fraud.
[02:07:07.500 --> 02:07:08.800]  We do have a minute or two more if you've got it.
[02:07:09.320 --> 02:07:10.381]  Elaborate on what you're saying.
[02:07:10.581 --> 02:07:11.041]  I mean, I agree.
[02:07:11.061 --> 02:07:14.302]  The internal polls, I know from Trump, but also other big groups are doing internal polls.
[02:07:14.843 --> 02:07:16.924]  5, 10, 15 points ahead in most battleground states.
[02:07:17.244 --> 02:07:18.484]  He's going to win in a landslide.
[02:07:18.724 --> 02:07:22.426]  They're only creating the perception he's way behind, so we buy it right now.
[02:07:22.446 --> 02:07:23.306]  Do you concur with that?
[02:07:23.466 --> 02:07:25.067]  A. B. What happens when he gets in?
[02:07:25.969 --> 02:07:26.190]  100% right.
[02:07:26.210 --> 02:07:27.335]  You and I think the same way.
[02:07:27.375 --> 02:07:29.242]  I said that to Donald yesterday on my radio show.
[02:07:29.302 --> 02:07:29.523]  I said...
[02:07:31.238 --> 02:07:31.698]  Uh, Donald.
[02:07:31.959 --> 02:07:36.402]  I said what they're doing is they're not trying to get people to vote for Hillary.
[02:07:36.442 --> 02:07:38.384]  They've got all the people they could ever, ever get.
[02:07:38.404 --> 02:07:44.568]  I said what they're trying to do is discourage Trump voters from voting by thinking that it's over already.
[02:07:44.608 --> 02:07:47.210]  They're trying to make them think that he lost, that she won.
[02:07:47.230 --> 02:07:49.452]  So they're going to throw their hands up and not vote for him.
[02:07:49.732 --> 02:07:53.255]  He's got to make sure that people think he can still win, which he can.
[02:07:54.176 --> 02:07:59.019]  And then if all of us who are supporting him come out, I think he will win.
[02:07:59.259 --> 02:07:59.900]  It's that simple.
[02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:01.641]  That's right, you can't steal landslides.
[02:08:01.681 --> 02:08:06.603]  I've interviewed experts who are Democrats, Republicans, die-bold engineers from the highest levels, they agree.
[02:08:07.263 --> 02:08:08.963]  You cannot steal a landslide.
[02:08:10.904 --> 02:08:12.505]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:08:12.545 --> 02:08:15.446]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:24.975 --> 02:08:49.853]  Gary Haven for part two of the interview we started yesterday is going to be joining us coming up at the bottom of the hour and we have a seven minute video we haven't premiered yet of the carnage in Haiti and when I sit back and try to prepare my mind to say put out a video chronicling the Clintons crimes it's mind-numbing I mean these are such truly nasty greedy horrible people
[02:08:50.677 --> 02:08:54.621]  That it's coming out that any building they're in, they just suddenly want everything in the building.
[02:08:54.641 --> 02:08:55.361]  They're kleptocrats.
[02:08:57.143 --> 02:09:06.251]  They are truly governing kleptomaniacs who want your very life.
[02:09:06.411 --> 02:09:15.860]  I mean, they knew for a decade that they were shipping HIV, hepatitis blood out and having it mixed into factor VIII so everyone would get HIV and hepatitis that took it.
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.141]  The hemophiliacs and others.
[02:09:19.818 --> 02:09:25.526]  And people came to the Clintons a couple years into it, and Hillary's like, we're getting paid, I don't care.
[02:09:25.566 --> 02:09:32.656]  I mean, I interviewed the doctor who was at the hospital, at the major prison, who actually went to the Clintons.
[02:09:33.717 --> 02:09:36.381]  Their response was to try to get him fired and have his offices robbed.
[02:09:37.796 --> 02:09:43.237]  I mean, it's pretty hardcore, folks, to know you're going to kill over 100,000 people conservatively that Clinton's killed.
[02:09:43.877 --> 02:09:50.899]  Other states, because they had that big blood scandal, there were shortages of blood, wouldn't sell it out of the inmates' stock because it was so many diseases.
[02:09:51.499 --> 02:09:53.160]  Well, they knew people had them and were doing it.
[02:09:54.080 --> 02:09:55.860]  And, you know, I go back to that.
[02:09:55.900 --> 02:09:57.801]  It's just like, man, these are bad people.
[02:09:59.041 --> 02:10:00.121]  Then it came out in the lawsuits.
[02:10:00.181 --> 02:10:00.701]  They knew.
[02:10:01.302 --> 02:10:03.142]  And so did the Bayer pharmaceutical head.
[02:10:05.933 --> 02:10:07.033]  Came out in the court records.
[02:10:07.113 --> 02:10:08.554]  They said, sir, this is going to kill people.
[02:10:08.574 --> 02:10:09.234]  They said, I don't care.
[02:10:09.694 --> 02:10:12.435]  Too many hemophiliacs, too many sick people anyways.
[02:10:14.376 --> 02:10:15.977]  And then all the witnesses to hurt.
[02:10:16.057 --> 02:10:26.801]  I mean, when a black person walks out of the room, she calls them an N-word or she'll do it to their face and hit Secret Service in the head with books and hit Bill in the head with ashtrays.
[02:10:26.901 --> 02:10:33.143]  I mean, you know, man, you know, the good part about it is that God appoints a man
[02:10:34.375 --> 02:10:35.556]  One life to live.
[02:10:35.756 --> 02:10:36.416]  75 years on average.
[02:10:36.436 --> 02:10:37.197]  And you know old Hillary?
[02:10:38.197 --> 02:10:39.578]  I don't think she's going to make it to 75.
[02:10:39.618 --> 02:10:42.159]  And I don't wish her, even personally, any harm.
[02:10:42.679 --> 02:10:45.401]  I just want that demonic entity to stop abusing innocent people.
[02:10:47.902 --> 02:10:49.043]  But I think about them stealing.
[02:10:49.063 --> 02:10:52.165]  I mean, they got over 90% of the donations that were supposed to go to Haiti.
[02:10:52.265 --> 02:10:53.105]  Everybody sent it to them.
[02:10:53.945 --> 02:10:54.686]  Because they're liberals.
[02:10:55.166 --> 02:10:57.888]  They're good white people and they're going to take care of the black people.
[02:10:58.568 --> 02:11:00.289]  And they stole all that money.
[02:11:01.664 --> 02:11:06.827]  And they started all these wars, and they do all these bad things, and they just are so wicked.
[02:11:10.369 --> 02:11:13.330]  But I guess we've become an evil nation, so that's who God's put over us.
[02:11:13.370 --> 02:11:20.974]  And I guess if we don't wake up and see through it all, and Trump's not going to be perfect, but he's not out to get us, then we deserve what we get.
[02:11:21.034 --> 02:11:21.655]  But here's the deal.
[02:11:21.855 --> 02:11:22.735]  America's doing the right thing.
[02:11:22.755 --> 02:11:23.616]  They're trying to elect Trump.
[02:11:25.029 --> 02:11:26.953]  You see the whole media and the whole system against him.
[02:11:27.313 --> 02:11:29.958]  You know, Larry Nichols, I'm going to have you back up tomorrow because you've been proven right.
[02:11:30.620 --> 02:11:37.472]  You've been on target on all of this and I really want to war game this with you and open the phones up too, but just in closing because I'm going to get Gary Haven on with the latest on Haiti.
[02:11:39.397 --> 02:11:41.679]  But Hillary Fixer breaks ranks.
[02:11:41.699 --> 02:11:44.200]  I arranged sex trust for her with women and men.
[02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:48.103]  But then it gets into all the other stuff that they were involved in.
[02:11:48.123 --> 02:11:55.007]  And how crazy she is, how like in between events, she'll go in like a powder room and have sex with a woman or a man.
[02:11:55.067 --> 02:11:56.969]  I mean, it just shows an addiction.
[02:11:56.989 --> 02:11:57.969]  She has to have everything.
[02:11:58.910 --> 02:12:00.551]  I mean, what is the psychology of these people?
[02:12:00.591 --> 02:12:05.715]  I know you've been involved with the Enquirer and some of their other big scoops, Vince Foster files and stuff like that.
[02:12:05.955 --> 02:12:06.875]  Were you involved in this?
[02:12:06.895 --> 02:12:09.017]  Because this just smells like you're one of the sources.
[02:12:09.677 --> 02:12:10.018]  Oh, yeah.
[02:12:10.318 --> 02:12:12.781]  Yeah, I was knee-deep in the middle of all of that.
[02:12:13.102 --> 02:12:19.770]  Helped do the background, helped do the research, helped to find a couple of people that are going to be testifying in it, or talking in it.
[02:12:19.951 --> 02:12:21.292]  Yeah, I was right in the middle of it.
[02:12:21.613 --> 02:12:23.896]  And, of course, you know I was one of the fixers.
[02:12:27.424 --> 02:12:31.447]  You know, you can't get any higher up in their group than I was.
[02:12:31.787 --> 02:12:32.148]  You can't.
[02:12:32.308 --> 02:12:34.069]  And that's been proven over and over again.
[02:12:34.109 --> 02:12:34.870]  So who are they?
[02:12:34.890 --> 02:12:37.672]  Because everybody I talk to says it's like there's nothing there.
[02:12:37.712 --> 02:12:53.704]  I've talked to special forces people and Blackwater folks separately that did security details for her in Iraq and other areas and they said that you'll get on a helicopter in a car or whatever and then she won't even talk to anybody unless she's cussing at you and that she'll almost like a robot just switch off.
[02:12:54.537 --> 02:12:56.418]  She'll just switch off and like go into a trance.
[02:12:56.698 --> 02:12:58.698]  Did you ever see that or is that something newer?
[02:12:59.859 --> 02:13:02.720]  No, I mean, she would just wig out.
[02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:05.621]  Alex, I'm just going to tell you the one thing you know about it.
[02:13:06.181 --> 02:13:10.722]  I had to justify her going out to LA about every four to six weeks to a witch's church.
[02:13:11.743 --> 02:13:14.384]  Finally, when it got so bad, I had to confront her.
[02:13:14.484 --> 02:13:15.244]  I said, Hillary,
[02:13:16.541 --> 02:13:17.781]  At least for show.
[02:13:18.342 --> 02:13:21.022]  At least for public show, if we get caught.
[02:13:21.062 --> 02:13:22.423]  You're gonna have to stand up.
[02:13:22.503 --> 02:13:24.143]  I know you go to Methodist Church.
[02:13:24.683 --> 02:13:26.604]  Stand up and say you believe in God.
[02:13:26.644 --> 02:13:28.384]  She turned away from me, Alex.
[02:13:28.744 --> 02:13:29.384]  Never will forget it.
[02:13:29.504 --> 02:13:30.805]  She turned away from me.
[02:13:30.965 --> 02:13:36.566]  And as she started to step away from me, she kind of tilted her head back and said, you know I can't do that.
[02:13:40.345 --> 02:13:41.805]  That's haunted me all the years.
[02:13:41.845 --> 02:13:43.005]  You know, what did she mean?
[02:13:43.105 --> 02:13:44.626]  You know I can't do that.
[02:13:45.186 --> 02:13:47.006]  I mean, if she made a deal with the devil.
[02:13:47.846 --> 02:13:56.048]  If there's ever been a person that has made a deal with the devil, I cannot imagine that they would act any different than Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[02:13:56.848 --> 02:13:57.488]  She's evil.
[02:13:57.948 --> 02:13:58.568]  She's mean.
[02:13:58.968 --> 02:14:00.128]  Bill's a good timer.
[02:14:00.148 --> 02:14:01.869]  He just wants the perks, buddy.
[02:14:02.289 --> 02:14:03.209]  That's all he wants.
[02:14:03.969 --> 02:14:08.750]  Hillary is pure, deep, evil, mean.
[02:14:09.952 --> 02:14:12.414]  Meaner than anything you've ever come in contact with.
[02:14:12.434 --> 02:14:17.036]  There's not a wild animal in Africa that will attack you.
[02:14:17.096 --> 02:14:24.561]  Well, let me just say, at a spiritual level, at this level, fighting her and picking up on this stuff, it's nauseating.
[02:14:25.061 --> 02:14:25.822]  I can't look at her.
[02:14:25.862 --> 02:14:26.702]  I'm really sick of her.
[02:14:26.742 --> 02:14:28.403]  I mean, she's a damn demon.
[02:14:28.643 --> 02:14:30.945]  And it seemed to really get to them that I called them demons.
[02:14:32.185 --> 02:14:32.786]  Well, it would.
[02:14:33.206 --> 02:14:34.247]  She's sensitive to that.
[02:14:34.627 --> 02:14:37.829]  But I'll tell you this, ask anybody that's ever been around her about the odor.
[02:14:39.019 --> 02:14:44.222]  Let's talk about the odor, because I've had Secret Service say she smells like basically like rotting meat.
[02:14:44.542 --> 02:14:45.563]  I said, what does it smell like?
[02:14:45.583 --> 02:14:47.284]  And a guy joked and goes, you know, crap.
[02:14:47.344 --> 02:14:47.865]  They go, no.
[02:14:48.145 --> 02:14:49.566]  He said the other word, S-H-U-N-O-Y.
[02:14:49.686 --> 02:14:51.867]  And they go, no, no, like rotting meat.
[02:14:52.067 --> 02:14:52.748]  We're all like, ugh.
[02:14:53.108 --> 02:14:54.829]  Then I talked to Dolly Kyle.
[02:14:54.869 --> 02:14:59.732]  She said, worst smell, dirtiest she's ever seen, just totally filthy all the time.
[02:14:59.752 --> 02:15:00.632]  Had to be around her for years.
[02:15:00.973 --> 02:15:02.334]  And then I talked to their chef.
[02:15:02.374 --> 02:15:02.834]  He said, yeah,
[02:15:03.214 --> 02:15:05.495]  I never got really close, but they say she stinks really bad.
[02:15:06.636 --> 02:15:09.678]  Obama, I've been told, smells like rotting meat.
[02:15:09.758 --> 02:15:11.779]  Now, the Bible says this is what demons smell like.
[02:15:12.100 --> 02:15:14.501]  I'm not... I just keep getting told they smell like hell.
[02:15:15.682 --> 02:15:16.322]  Tell us, Larry.
[02:15:16.822 --> 02:15:18.163]  Look, you're talking to the guy.
[02:15:18.343 --> 02:15:27.029]  The first time I met her, she was all dirty, filthy, dirty hair, wearing a moo-moo, flip-flops, and she smelled horrible.
[02:15:27.089 --> 02:15:29.190]  Well, I thought it was because of her hygiene.
[02:15:30.031 --> 02:15:30.411]  Later,
[02:15:31.576 --> 02:15:31.876]  Yes, sir.
[02:15:52.392 --> 02:15:53.993]  You know, just rotten.
[02:15:54.174 --> 02:15:55.194]  It's just a rotten smell.
[02:15:55.354 --> 02:15:58.857]  Well, I know the Secret Service people, I mean, look scared.
[02:15:58.897 --> 02:16:00.277]  They said, listen, she's scary.
[02:16:00.578 --> 02:16:05.661]  I know they're all making jokes about it, but everybody that works around her, it's in the WikiLeaks, knows that this woman is like Linda Blair.
[02:16:06.201 --> 02:16:08.923]  Hey, let me tell you, that is sage guy at WikiLeaks.
[02:16:08.943 --> 02:16:10.444]  Let's get one thing out in the open.
[02:16:10.864 --> 02:16:15.087]  The Ecuadorian government did not knock him off the internet.
[02:16:15.675 --> 02:16:18.576]  They could unplug his computer, but they couldn't knock him off.
[02:16:18.636 --> 02:16:23.457]  You're seeing the first example of the UN having control of domain.
[02:16:23.878 --> 02:16:25.318]  That's what knocked him off.
[02:16:25.378 --> 02:16:37.502]  And I'm going to tell you, if that Ecuadorian consulate kicks him out, which the Clintons are going to force him to do, you put this down in your book of Nichols quotes, Assange is dead in a week.
[02:16:38.702 --> 02:16:39.942]  Dead in a week.
[02:16:42.543 --> 02:16:45.244]  Now, you can't get any tougher than that.
[02:16:46.016 --> 02:16:47.597]  You do not cross the Clintons.
[02:16:48.018 --> 02:16:48.678]  Not like that.
[02:16:48.778 --> 02:16:49.139]  You don't.
[02:16:49.359 --> 02:16:50.000]  And walk away.
[02:16:50.060 --> 02:16:50.820]  Well, let me ask you this.
[02:16:50.900 --> 02:16:53.082]  I know they've tried to take you out and other people.
[02:16:53.442 --> 02:16:54.103]  What do you expect?
[02:16:54.143 --> 02:16:55.644]  Because I mean, I understand.
[02:16:56.025 --> 02:16:59.688]  But what do you expect to happen to yours truly?
[02:16:59.948 --> 02:17:01.229]  She calls me the dark heart.
[02:17:02.771 --> 02:17:07.775]  Alex, if she wins, and we don't do after if she wins,
[02:17:08.581 --> 02:17:13.805]  The only option for us is not to drain the swamp with, you know, term limits.
[02:17:13.845 --> 02:17:15.206]  The option is states' rights.
[02:17:15.226 --> 02:17:16.427]  I'm not going to get into that now.
[02:17:16.468 --> 02:17:16.908]  No, I agree.
[02:17:16.928 --> 02:17:17.809]  We have to go next level.
[02:17:17.849 --> 02:17:18.549]  You know the good news?
[02:17:19.090 --> 02:17:21.332]  People now get it, and folks are going to the next level.
[02:17:21.552 --> 02:17:22.633]  They think they got power.
[02:17:22.653 --> 02:17:23.373]  They think they're evil.
[02:17:23.393 --> 02:17:24.034]  They want to brag.
[02:17:24.094 --> 02:17:24.954]  Others are stealing elections.
[02:17:25.315 --> 02:17:29.718]  They're forcing a lot of people that were on the fence now, who are very serious people, to get ready.
[02:17:30.439 --> 02:17:32.080]  And they've tried to remove all the top generals.
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:32.841]  That hasn't worked.
[02:17:32.861 --> 02:17:36.024]  The military is beside itself, as you know, Larry.
[02:17:37.307 --> 02:17:38.968]  Well, and I'm going to tell you this, guys.
[02:17:39.248 --> 02:17:46.330]  If they were ahead, like they are pretending to be, trust me, they wouldn't be acting the way they are.
[02:17:46.470 --> 02:17:49.771]  They wouldn't have this media blitz, because Alex, they know what I know.
[02:17:50.131 --> 02:17:55.913]  You keep pushing this thing with the media like they're doing it, you run into back, you know, you end up in blowback.
[02:17:55.953 --> 02:17:58.193]  You worry about people thinking you're piling on.
[02:17:58.534 --> 02:17:59.834]  You get the sympathy vote.
[02:18:00.394 --> 02:18:01.754]  They're not, they wouldn't do that.
[02:18:01.995 --> 02:18:04.815]  They wouldn't be going totally nuclear if they weren't in crisis.
[02:18:05.115 --> 02:18:06.656]  Well no, that's why Trump keeps saying it's rigged.
[02:18:06.956 --> 02:18:09.337]  Look, he goes and gets real internal polls and so do the Democrats.
[02:18:09.357 --> 02:18:13.778]  I mean, I was talking to a major polling company last night and they said, my God, it's 60-30, 10% undecided.
[02:18:14.038 --> 02:18:15.138]  Trump is at 60 nationwide.
[02:18:18.186 --> 02:18:25.252]  I think you're going to see what may, I'm hoping we see what happened in Europe, you know, with the Brexit thing.
[02:18:25.472 --> 02:18:25.732]  Yeah.
[02:18:26.413 --> 02:18:32.338]  Well, notice, notice, notice Gingrich said Trump's really 15 ahead on Sunday because he kind of let go what's internal.
[02:18:33.258 --> 02:18:41.425]  Well, trust me, they would not be acting the way, and y'all folks listening, you're getting it from a guy that was with them and designed most of their dirty tricks.
[02:18:41.906 --> 02:18:45.929]  They would not be doing what they're doing now with such vigor.
[02:18:46.986 --> 02:18:48.809]  If they were ahead, they wouldn't be.
[02:18:49.790 --> 02:18:50.851]  They would not be.
[02:18:51.152 --> 02:18:58.943]  And when they talk about tonight being the big deal, all I got to say, Alex, in closing, is tonight is Trump's night.
[02:18:59.243 --> 02:19:03.208]  He's got to come out like a focused laser beam and just chop her to pieces.
[02:19:04.252 --> 02:19:09.716]  Just tell the truth and look in the camera and don't pay attention to anything going on.
[02:19:09.856 --> 02:19:10.877]  You tell the truth.
[02:19:11.017 --> 02:19:11.938]  Tell about her.
[02:19:12.678 --> 02:19:16.701]  You know, stay away from the girly stuff because you're going to ask him that to get him distracted.
[02:19:16.761 --> 02:19:22.345]  He needs not to ever answer a question tonight about these claims by these women.
[02:19:22.665 --> 02:19:24.607]  He shouldn't answer a question at all, Alex.
[02:19:24.647 --> 02:19:30.271]  He needs to make a list of the things he wants to tell 50 to 60 Americans and tell it tonight.
[02:19:31.104 --> 02:19:32.645]  Alright, Larry Nichols, thank you so much.
[02:19:32.685 --> 02:19:35.245]  Well, we sure hit a nerve talking about how they reportedly stink.
[02:19:36.146 --> 02:19:37.326]  They say even worse with Hillary.
[02:19:37.646 --> 02:19:41.548]  And I always thought it was like psychopaths and people like Mao didn't care so they stunk just to be aggressive.
[02:19:42.088 --> 02:19:44.829]  But I think there's something more to it and the fly's all landing on them.
[02:19:45.209 --> 02:19:45.489]  Larry?
[02:19:47.610 --> 02:19:50.471]  Let me just tell you, there is something bad around them.
[02:19:50.531 --> 02:19:53.812]  And Alex, I want to close with you asking me the question, what about yours truly?
[02:19:53.852 --> 02:19:54.352]  Meaning you.
[02:19:55.953 --> 02:19:56.913]  If he wins,
[02:19:57.794 --> 02:20:01.535]  They're going to use the Fairness Doctrine and take people off the radio.
[02:20:01.575 --> 02:20:03.716]  Hold on, we've got to skip the break because we're talking about Fairness Doctrine.
[02:20:03.736 --> 02:20:05.197]  I'm in on a beer, so this won't matter.
[02:20:05.457 --> 02:20:14.680]  They admit, they say they've got a tied vote in the Federal Elections Commission, a tied vote in the Supreme Court, a tied vote in the FCC.
[02:20:14.961 --> 02:20:15.521]  All groups
[02:20:16.221 --> 02:20:19.342]  On the Democrat side say they're going to ban talk radio and internet news.
[02:20:19.362 --> 02:20:22.763]  Hillary said the alt-right has quote no right to exist.
[02:20:22.803 --> 02:20:27.585]  I mean they've told us because they've got it because they got to come out in the open when they finally come for our First Amendment.
[02:20:28.145 --> 02:20:32.047]  And all the little leftists now think it's fun to ban words and ban speech.
[02:20:32.947 --> 02:20:37.131]  And then these idiot leftists don't know the prosperity's all gonna end as soon as they bring the Republic down.
[02:20:37.431 --> 02:20:44.938]  They are such fools, living in the bosom of what's left of this Republic, pissing on it all day, not having any idea they're about to lose everything, Larry.
[02:20:45.138 --> 02:20:46.620]  So you're getting into what's gonna happen.
[02:20:47.259 --> 02:20:52.663]  Well, what's going to happen, I'm telling you, it was a cool move when they moved that internet over to the U.N.
[02:20:52.963 --> 02:20:53.903]  Because you see, the U.N.
[02:20:53.924 --> 02:20:55.845]  doesn't have to honor our Constitution.
[02:20:55.925 --> 02:21:02.609]  And they're saying they're going to follow the new political correct stuff that Wikileaks shows Soros is running through Facebook.
[02:21:02.629 --> 02:21:07.433]  They admit they're, quote, going to shut down the alt media and only, quote, promote our media.
[02:21:07.473 --> 02:21:08.353]  That little bastard.
[02:21:09.254 --> 02:21:10.094]  Bastards aren't bad people.
[02:21:10.114 --> 02:21:11.155]  I shouldn't call Soros a bastard.
[02:21:11.375 --> 02:21:17.119]  That little murdering demon Nazi collaborator weirdo openly says in the Wikileaks he's going to shut us up.
[02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:29.809]  You remember the first time I ever heard George Soros speak, he said he would take his entire wealth and devote every penny of it to destroying America.
[02:21:30.538 --> 02:21:32.999]  And by God, he's got a tool now with the Clintons.
[02:21:33.659 --> 02:21:35.079]  They've got the tool they need.
[02:21:35.139 --> 02:21:36.760]  Why did he try to overthrow England?
[02:21:36.820 --> 02:21:37.380]  He admits it.
[02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:40.041]  Why does he try to overthrow everything Western and prosperous?
[02:21:40.081 --> 02:21:40.861]  What is his problem?
[02:21:41.381 --> 02:21:43.142]  Because he believes in a global power.
[02:21:43.322 --> 02:21:55.705]  He believes that if you get the government the way Bill Clinton used to tell me, remember the perfect kind of government is you've got the number of ultra, ultra rich people you can count on one hand, five fingers, and everybody else is dirt poor.
[02:21:56.305 --> 02:21:57.966]  Whoever controls that group
[02:21:58.672 --> 02:21:59.613]  Controls the world.
[02:22:00.033 --> 02:22:02.595]  And by the way, you've been saying that on my show for 20 years.
[02:22:02.996 --> 02:22:12.823]  In the new WikiLeaks, I think it was WikiLeaks 9, yeah it was WikiLeaks 10, there's document after document in there saying we want to keep them dumb, distracted, poor.
[02:22:13.204 --> 02:22:15.225]  I mean it's so mean, it's so evil.
[02:22:16.026 --> 02:22:20.530]  Well, and the problem is they've got a massive number of people that
[02:22:21.230 --> 02:22:22.991]  Seem to buy into their stuff.
[02:22:23.192 --> 02:22:36.361]  Yeah, we're all these weird trendy leftists that they're making top lieutenants who like prance around a little little trendy outfits talking about stealing elections and killing people and murder and power and they've never even killed anybody Larry.
[02:22:36.921 --> 02:22:42.005]  No, but think about this if you or I made those kind of claims we would be in jail today.
[02:22:42.813 --> 02:22:43.474]  We'd be in jail.
[02:22:43.834 --> 02:22:45.535]  There's no action being brought about him.
[02:22:45.975 --> 02:22:52.300]  Remember when I told you, you asked me a hundred times, Alex, at least a hundred times, will Hillary be indicted?
[02:22:52.780 --> 02:22:55.762]  And you justified it, and you told me Comey was such a crackpot.
[02:22:55.782 --> 02:22:57.063]  You said never, never, never, never.
[02:22:57.704 --> 02:22:59.285]  And by God, they didn't, did they?
[02:23:01.041 --> 02:23:01.621]  They didn't.
[02:23:01.701 --> 02:23:05.182]  Yeah, people, Larry, all I can say is everything you've ever said has turned out to be true.
[02:23:05.242 --> 02:23:06.282]  It's sickeningly accurate.
[02:23:06.622 --> 02:23:12.823]  Except you said they were going to, and I called around and said, yeah, they're trying to order the FBI and others to cook up something on you.
[02:23:13.284 --> 02:23:18.945]  And then I guess there was some revolt because it didn't happen, but you said they were going to reportedly raid us and make something up last year.
[02:23:19.525 --> 02:23:20.185]  They were trying.
[02:23:20.205 --> 02:23:21.885]  They were trying.
[02:23:22.205 --> 02:23:26.946]  But you've got to remember, at certain levels, they've got people back then that wouldn't honor it.
[02:23:27.527 --> 02:23:29.367]  They don't have that problem today, Alex.
[02:23:30.148 --> 02:23:32.550]  There's nobody in the FBI that's going to go against them.
[02:23:32.851 --> 02:23:33.351]  You know that.
[02:23:33.972 --> 02:23:42.480]  When she gets the power of the presidency, buddy, you'd be a fool if you worked for the FBI, CIA, NSA.
[02:23:42.580 --> 02:23:45.823]  You'd be a fool if you crossed them.
[02:23:46.844 --> 02:23:49.646]  It won't just be the end of your career, as you know.
[02:23:50.928 --> 02:23:52.289]  It'll be far worse than that.
[02:23:52.924 --> 02:23:53.965]  And look at Donald Trump.
[02:23:54.045 --> 02:24:03.669]  If Donald Trump loses his world that he could have lived out the rest of his life in luxury and fame, you don't see they've destroyed his character.
[02:24:03.709 --> 02:24:04.570]  They've destroyed him.
[02:24:05.598 --> 02:24:07.439]  Donald Trump will never be the same if he loses.
[02:24:07.879 --> 02:24:22.344]  And you know what's sad is he won't even, he may tell it later, but he was approached by good people in the military after Benghazi and he went to Scotland where his mom's from, spent over a month and a half, I think two months, and actually cogitated on it.
[02:24:22.524 --> 02:24:25.705]  And I was told before it ever came out in political, parts of it came out.
[02:24:26.546 --> 02:24:29.547]  And he called him back and he came back to New York and he met with the people and he
[02:24:30.447 --> 02:24:31.228]  He said, I can't do it.
[02:24:31.268 --> 02:24:35.270]  He goes, I just, you know, I don't know if the public understands all this or knew this and that.
[02:24:35.290 --> 02:24:35.911]  I got a great life.
[02:24:36.911 --> 02:24:43.376]  And then he just realized, though, that he saw basically how people were getting poor and how people on the street weren't doing well.
[02:24:43.896 --> 02:24:44.616]  And he hated to see.
[02:24:44.656 --> 02:24:45.797]  And he said, OK, I'm going to do it.
[02:24:46.878 --> 02:24:49.500]  And and he's totally he's doing it to save.
[02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:50.500]  He's not perfect.
[02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:51.881]  He doesn't want to hurt us, though.
[02:24:51.901 --> 02:24:53.002]  He's not a damn demon.
[02:24:53.442 --> 02:24:56.004]  And, you know, he's totally in the arena, Larry.
[02:24:56.704 --> 02:24:59.046]  Well, Trump says the magic words to me.
[02:24:59.901 --> 02:25:05.207]  He's trying to pay back America for what it's given him the opportunity to do.
[02:25:06.468 --> 02:25:19.361]  And I feel sorry for him and his family, because every building they've got under construction in the United States of America, and eventually in the world, is going to run into every kind of problem the government can issue them.
[02:25:19.962 --> 02:25:21.143]  They're going to be stunned.
[02:25:21.323 --> 02:25:24.705]  Well, I mean, look, the word is, the word is, Trump's already lost billions.
[02:25:24.785 --> 02:25:26.425]  It's confirmed, 500 million.
[02:25:26.866 --> 02:25:28.446]  They are already destroying him right now.
[02:25:28.967 --> 02:25:35.770]  But you notice, I've been told he's gone from being a little bit kid-like and worldly, to like so solid now, it's actually made him stronger.
[02:25:35.790 --> 02:25:37.631]  And notice how hardcore he's getting.
[02:25:38.451 --> 02:25:42.113]  Well, I think Donald Trump has finally found his faith.
[02:25:42.913 --> 02:25:44.834]  And that'll get him through a tough time.
[02:25:45.515 --> 02:25:53.583]  But let's not think he's lost yet, because I'm telling you all, and you're taking it from a technical like me, they're not behind.
[02:25:54.444 --> 02:25:55.385]  Now, will he win?
[02:25:55.706 --> 02:25:56.366]  You know, I don't know.
[02:25:56.406 --> 02:25:57.828]  There's a whole lot of dynamics.
[02:25:58.308 --> 02:26:00.751]  Next time we talk, we'll talk about Electoral College.
[02:26:00.791 --> 02:26:02.072]  I mean, there's all kinds of tricks.
[02:26:07.153 --> 02:26:07.433]  Yeah.
[02:26:07.893 --> 02:26:09.574]  I mean, remember this, Alex.
[02:26:09.894 --> 02:26:16.177]  When you hear Hillary claim Trump's working with the Russians, there's one rule that never will let you down.
[02:26:16.277 --> 02:26:18.077]  Whatever she accuses you of, she's doing.
[02:26:18.718 --> 02:26:19.098]  You got it.
[02:26:19.438 --> 02:26:19.878]  You got it.
[02:26:20.238 --> 02:26:22.139]  As long as you know that, you're safe.
[02:26:22.359 --> 02:26:24.320]  And if they tell you it's up, it's down.
[02:26:24.380 --> 02:26:25.921]  If they tell you it's left, it's right.
[02:26:26.121 --> 02:26:28.081]  Whatever they tell you, it's the opposite.
[02:26:37.737 --> 02:26:55.109]  I look at the people they've collected into the media, and there's been a few at CBS that left and exposed the truth, but they really have put a collection of sycophantic trash into the mainstream media who gleefully compete to be deceptive and really do hate the average American.
[02:26:55.129 --> 02:26:56.770]  And you know, that comes out in the WikiLeaks.
[02:26:56.830 --> 02:26:58.551]  I mean, they really did find trash.
[02:26:58.931 --> 02:27:01.053]  And I didn't know there was this much trash in this country.
[02:27:01.934 --> 02:27:02.434]  Oh, you bet.
[02:27:02.734 --> 02:27:03.335]  You bet.
[02:27:03.575 --> 02:27:06.696]  And especially in the elite, literate world.
[02:27:06.857 --> 02:27:10.478]  You know, they consider themselves so far above you and me, Alex.
[02:27:10.618 --> 02:27:12.619]  They're the smart people.
[02:27:13.220 --> 02:27:16.822]  But they're so stupid that they can't even look at history.
[02:27:17.122 --> 02:27:21.944]  They can't go back even at recent history and look at the Clintons and look at everybody.
[02:27:21.964 --> 02:27:22.825]  Oh, there's no doubt.
[02:27:22.885 --> 02:27:24.605]  It might be a year, it might be ten.
[02:27:24.946 --> 02:27:28.367]  But the further they push it, I don't want this to happen, but it's going to be bad.
[02:27:28.407 --> 02:27:31.349]  They're going to be, every lamp pole in this country is going to have them hanging from it.
[02:27:31.829 --> 02:27:32.249]  You got it.
[02:27:32.630 --> 02:27:33.070]  You got it.
[02:27:33.210 --> 02:27:38.153]  Just remember, go back, read Mein Kampf, the book that I used when I was helping Bill.
[02:27:38.193 --> 02:27:41.216]  The book he gave me for my first Christmas present with him.
[02:27:41.436 --> 02:27:42.496]  Said, be my gerbil.
[02:27:43.097 --> 02:27:47.860]  Go back and read it and you'll see the plan that they're implementing today.
[02:27:48.861 --> 02:27:52.103]  And they have found scumbags just like you're talking in the media.
[02:27:52.183 --> 02:27:55.005]  And they've cleared out the people that were semi-truthful.
[02:27:55.405 --> 02:27:55.966]  They're gone.
[02:27:56.937 --> 02:28:03.479]  And all of these people, just like you're saying, they're competing to get to be in favor with Hillary.
[02:28:04.920 --> 02:28:06.820]  That might not be a dumb move, actually.
[02:28:06.860 --> 02:28:10.521]  If she gets elected, they might want to be in favor for their own protection.
[02:28:10.761 --> 02:28:13.422]  But I'm saying, they're gonna be destroyed in the end.
[02:28:13.862 --> 02:28:14.903]  They're gonna be destroyed.
[02:28:15.063 --> 02:28:16.463]  Yeah, Hillary's gonna stand before God.
[02:28:16.483 --> 02:28:17.324]  I'm not scared of her.
[02:28:17.904 --> 02:28:18.024]  Yep.
[02:28:19.242 --> 02:28:23.404]  I'm scared of what she's doing to the country, but... What she's doing to her own children is why we've got to stand against her.
[02:28:24.645 --> 02:28:26.025]  NicholsLive at AOL.com.
[02:28:26.066 --> 02:28:32.849]  Folks want to help you out with your operation to try to expose election fraud you've been dead on so people can make donations there to help Larry Nichols.
[02:28:32.869 --> 02:28:36.611]  Larry Nichols, 58 Kingston Drive, Conway, Arkansas 72034.
[02:28:37.291 --> 02:28:38.452]  We'll talk to you again tomorrow, Larry.
[02:28:38.492 --> 02:28:38.772]  Thank you.
[02:28:39.292 --> 02:28:40.013]  Sounds great, Betty.
[02:28:40.153 --> 02:28:40.673]  See ya.
[02:28:56.445 --> 02:28:57.506]  We're going to break here in a moment.
[02:28:57.526 --> 02:28:59.247]  We have a powerful video we're going to play as well.
[02:29:00.088 --> 02:29:10.316]  Wow, what do you think hearing all this news about the Clintons and admitting massive election fraud already taking place as their own national heads admit they're involved in crime but say they're above the law, Gary?
[02:29:12.818 --> 02:29:16.641]  You know, I'm an eyewitness down here to the Clinton criminality.
[02:29:17.782 --> 02:29:21.004]  There's 1.4 million people that are desperate right now.
[02:29:21.044 --> 02:29:24.647]  No roofs on their homes, no crops, no food.
[02:29:25.282 --> 02:29:25.502]  Are you
[02:29:45.225 --> 02:29:47.808]  And I call her a monster and a thief.
[02:29:48.428 --> 02:29:50.350]  You know, that's a payoff for her.
[02:29:51.351 --> 02:29:57.417]  She's gleeful about the fact that she can get away with this.
[02:29:57.637 --> 02:29:58.038]  Stay there.
[02:29:58.058 --> 02:29:59.199]  We'll come right back to you, my friend.
[02:29:59.219 --> 02:29:59.800]  Stay right there.

[02:31:18.214 --> 02:31:26.265]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:31:26.605 --> 02:31:31.287]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:31:31.468 --> 02:31:38.211]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:38.271 --> 02:31:45.354]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:31:45.455 --> 02:31:52.298]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:31:52.458 --> 02:31:56.822]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:31:56.942 --> 02:32:00.205]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:32:00.345 --> 02:32:06.471]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:32:06.651 --> 02:32:08.312]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[02:32:10.310 --> 02:32:19.935]  There's an article up on our website on Infowars.com written by Clifford Cunningham that addresses one anonymous Navy official telling Alaskans prepare for war.
[02:32:20.175 --> 02:32:24.257]  This official suggests that Russia is preparing an invasion in response to U.S.
[02:32:24.317 --> 02:32:24.738]  strikes.
[02:32:24.858 --> 02:32:30.861]  He's unnamed but he's warned the residents of Alaska to prepare for an invasion in the event of war between the U.S.
[02:32:30.901 --> 02:32:30.961]  and
[02:32:30.981 --> 02:32:31.201]  I don't
[02:32:53.933 --> 02:33:03.462]  He goes on to say our feeling in the Navy was that Obama has turned Alaska into a defenseless area that will serve as a forward base of operations when World War III begins.
[02:33:03.702 --> 02:33:05.764]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:33:20.498 --> 02:33:24.420]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:33:24.900 --> 02:33:26.441]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.242 --> 02:33:37.786]  I know the listeners know this, but I'm speaking to the White House minions and the Media Matters folks and MSNBC and everybody.
[02:33:37.846 --> 02:33:39.967]  I mean, I've studied history.
[02:33:40.047 --> 02:33:41.447]  I'm studying what the Clintons have done.
[02:33:41.507 --> 02:33:43.028]  I've got their emails confirming it.
[02:33:43.928 --> 02:33:45.169]  I've talked to all the people involved.
[02:33:46.283 --> 02:33:57.969]  People that don't even know each other say the Clintons are super racist, they steal everything not nailed down, they don't give tips, they steal 94% of the money from Haiti.
[02:33:57.989 --> 02:34:01.931]  They're out collecting it again and the media won't even do anything.
[02:34:01.971 --> 02:34:07.474]  I mean it's been in the news that they steal the money but it's like it's alright because they're the Clintons.
[02:34:07.554 --> 02:34:11.756]  It's just like a demonic protection and I keep going back to this because
[02:34:14.008 --> 02:34:14.688]  I'm going to be honest.
[02:34:14.808 --> 02:34:22.832]  I'm not a person that gets scared of these people, but I'm more freaked out because I've seen hours of footage.
[02:34:22.852 --> 02:34:24.492]  We're going to play some of it coming up here in a few minutes.
[02:34:25.553 --> 02:34:26.893]  For radio listeners, I'll kind of narrate it.
[02:34:26.933 --> 02:34:29.635]  We're going to post the video later this afternoon, InfoWars.com.
[02:34:31.015 --> 02:34:40.899]  With the UN standing down, with our taxpayer money, they're just there to control the situation, I guess, and be on the news so they can claim they're taking care of people, not medevacking people to the local city.
[02:34:45.663 --> 02:34:51.226]  The Clintons stealing all the money, collecting more money, and the crimes go on and on and on.
[02:34:52.266 --> 02:34:55.548]  And then these weird, spoiled, rotten kids are the baby boomers.
[02:34:57.389 --> 02:35:14.037]  And, I mean, I'm a Generation X, Millennial, whatever you want to call it, but Generation X people and Millennials are like these weird, I'm not saying all of us, but on average, weird, soft, disconnected people that as long as they tie into the power structure, they feel like they're winning, they don't care how evil it is.
[02:35:15.367 --> 02:35:16.029]  Just shut up!
[02:35:16.069 --> 02:35:17.172]  You're a guy Trump's gonna lose.
[02:35:17.192 --> 02:35:19.498]  And I'm like, what about Haiti?
[02:35:19.538 --> 02:35:20.862]  Okay, let's just say Trump doesn't win.
[02:35:21.283 --> 02:35:22.145]  Haiti, it's really wrong.
[02:35:22.185 --> 02:35:23.348]  Oh, just shut up, bigot.
[02:35:25.134 --> 02:35:29.177]  And they drive in the fast lane slow and make you get behind them and laugh at you?
[02:35:29.197 --> 02:35:31.338]  I mean, I'm beginning to study the psychology.
[02:35:31.358 --> 02:35:32.819]  They're like gremlins or something.
[02:35:33.059 --> 02:35:40.283]  They pull into gas stations and block both rows and smile at you and like the professor types their leaders that are baby boomers do it.
[02:35:40.564 --> 02:35:42.265]  I'm starting to take photos of them and even interview them.
[02:35:42.285 --> 02:35:45.647]  I'm going to put a film together where I'm going to confront them and say, oh, I see you're a Democrat.
[02:35:45.687 --> 02:35:46.747]  I see you driving the fast lane.
[02:35:46.767 --> 02:35:47.828]  I see you block traffic.
[02:35:48.208 --> 02:35:51.971]  Showing the studies where they're six times more likely not to give to charity and to steal.
[02:35:52.631 --> 02:35:53.612]  That's in major studies.
[02:35:53.672 --> 02:36:06.089]  I mean, what they are is criminals who hate everyone and aren't successful, so they create systems to take over and then make us, the successful, their slaves.
[02:36:09.457 --> 02:36:10.038]  It's spiritual.
[02:36:10.058 --> 02:36:16.063]  I mean, I know Gary's a strong Christian, and I'm not somebody that goes to church or thumps the Bible or anything, but the more you study this, it's spiritual.
[02:36:16.083 --> 02:36:19.206]  Now, Gary, I've been ranting and you're waiting to talk about this and draw attention to it.
[02:36:19.226 --> 02:36:23.349]  We're going to have you back up next week to talk about charities out there that actually do deliver food to folks.
[02:36:23.370 --> 02:36:25.752]  I know you don't collect money to go to the charity, you just give your own money, but
[02:36:26.832 --> 02:36:35.600]  Again, it makes me feel cold, almost, just to even get near the Clintons and study them, because they're such demons.
[02:36:35.680 --> 02:36:37.642]  And when I say demons, it's the only way to describe them.
[02:36:38.062 --> 02:36:49.372]  They go out of their way to hurt people, and then they have a whole system, a cult, that props them up and worships them and tends them and lies for them.
[02:36:49.392 --> 02:36:52.515]  So, Gary, you were getting into the fact that
[02:36:53.601 --> 02:36:53.901]  Is there any
[02:37:14.036 --> 02:37:15.337]  That's a great question Alex.
[02:37:15.617 --> 02:37:16.658]  You know, the Bible tells us
[02:37:34.350 --> 02:37:43.577]  In the latter days, that we would call evil good and good evil, and that we would reject righteousness, and that he would give us over to great delusion.
[02:37:43.978 --> 02:37:54.506]  Because there's no way that a thinking person can, for example, look at the Clinton Foundation that's stolen two billion dollars from these little children, the poorest in the hemisphere.
[02:37:56.247 --> 02:38:02.832]  And yet they continue to have half of the country thinking it's a good idea that this monster become the leader of the free world.
[02:38:03.442 --> 02:38:05.283]  The only way that can happen is under delusion.
[02:38:05.964 --> 02:38:11.748]  And so we're experiencing a great delusion, and there's no other explanation for it.
[02:38:14.309 --> 02:38:29.440]  I want to go through what you're witnessing, the state of things, and play this seven minute clip and come back to you, but in your gut, and I always go back to gut, but also intellectually, you're a smart guy.
[02:38:30.632 --> 02:38:31.433]  What do you think is coming?
[02:38:31.473 --> 02:38:32.273]  What are we facing?
[02:38:32.293 --> 02:38:35.015]  Because the energy level in the world, everybody feels it.
[02:38:36.036 --> 02:38:37.557]  This is a special election right now.
[02:38:37.978 --> 02:38:39.239]  What's happening worldwide is special.
[02:38:39.279 --> 02:38:40.740]  We're at a decision time.
[02:38:41.620 --> 02:38:51.408]  And I think in my gut, I know if we don't elect Trump, but beyond that, if we don't all start making the right decision to stand up and speak out, I believe we're going to come under great judgment.
[02:38:51.868 --> 02:38:55.611]  And I believe there's going to be a total worldwide financial meltdown and probably a world war.
[02:38:55.631 --> 02:38:59.334]  And I think, I think like the Bible says, I think a third or more of the population is going to be killed.
[02:39:01.443 --> 02:39:12.972]  Yeah, we're clearly in a fight with globalism and nationalism, whether it's Brexit or what's going on with Marine Le Pen in France.
[02:39:14.873 --> 02:39:16.214]  The globalists have come out.
[02:39:16.274 --> 02:39:19.957]  Hillary has announced she's the globalist candidate.
[02:39:20.557 --> 02:39:21.958]  Trump's the nationalist candidate.
[02:39:21.978 --> 02:39:23.499]  He wants to make America great again.
[02:39:24.020 --> 02:39:24.920]  And that's the great battle.
[02:39:25.080 --> 02:39:28.603]  And this globalism, the Bible predicts, is going to happen.
[02:39:29.249 --> 02:39:32.532]  The Bible tells us that it's going to be led by the Antichrist himself.
[02:39:33.132 --> 02:39:36.014]  You know, you're going to have to take the mark of the beast to buy or sell.
[02:39:37.735 --> 02:39:45.081]  This was written 2,000 years ago, and even the ability to require people to take a mark to buy or sell was even conceivable then.
[02:39:45.101 --> 02:39:54.288]  They're suddenly on every channel, NBC, CBS, Fox, Dr. Oz, all saying, take a mark to buy and sell, make yourself, they're now saying it.
[02:39:55.879 --> 02:40:00.340]  Yeah, they want a cashless society because it's going to... Oh, that came out in the WikiLeaks.
[02:40:00.740 --> 02:40:02.821]  Apple wants a total cashless society.
[02:40:02.841 --> 02:40:03.121]  Sorry.
[02:40:04.342 --> 02:40:09.943]  Yeah, I mean, it's... Man, if people can't see what's going on right now, they're... well, they're deluded.
[02:40:09.963 --> 02:40:11.364]  Can they even see the symbol?
[02:40:11.424 --> 02:40:12.584]  What is the symbol of Apple?
[02:40:14.125 --> 02:40:14.385]  Yeah.
[02:40:14.725 --> 02:40:17.285]  Yeah, Satan's Apple he gave to Eve.
[02:40:17.305 --> 02:40:18.946]  You can't make this stuff up, man!
[02:40:21.147 --> 02:40:21.947]  It's crazy, isn't it?
[02:40:22.107 --> 02:40:25.308]  At a certain point, I'm just kind of like, whatever, everybody wants this fine, you know?
[02:40:27.247 --> 02:40:29.289]  Well, let me tell you about the evil that's going on here.
[02:40:29.309 --> 02:40:38.097]  You know, you've got 1.4 million people that have been hit by a horrible earthquake, and they've got no food, no water, no medical supplies.
[02:40:38.137 --> 02:40:41.700]  And all the leftist scum doesn't care that their god stole all the damn money!
[02:40:43.141 --> 02:40:53.584]  Hillary is hated here, and the reason there's no coverage, there's no network media here, and I'm convinced it's because they're providing Hillary cover again.
[02:40:53.604 --> 02:41:04.988]  It's not enough that she sold $2 billion to the poorest people on this hemisphere, but now the media is providing her cover, and the world doesn't understand the disaster that we have here.
[02:41:06.158 --> 02:41:15.926]  Hear me talk about, I'm the only one feeding thousands of people, and we're the only air evac for two of the primary areas that were severely damaged.
[02:41:16.187 --> 02:41:25.615]  We brought in a little boy today, and yesterday brought in a couple people that would have died if my plane was not available.
[02:41:25.875 --> 02:41:31.660]  And so, you know, who am I to be here feeding this many people, saving these lives?
[02:41:32.597 --> 02:41:35.862]  When the world is supposed to have some sort of response to this thing.
[02:41:35.902 --> 02:41:40.269]  And the media is not here because they're covering Hillary.
[02:41:40.690 --> 02:41:44.877]  They're criminally complicit in the death of these people that I'm working with.
[02:41:45.814 --> 02:41:46.375]  Think about that.
[02:41:46.415 --> 02:41:47.315]  You've got four planes.
[02:41:47.335 --> 02:41:48.637]  You're feeding 4,000 people.
[02:41:48.677 --> 02:41:49.698]  You're the main medevac.
[02:41:49.718 --> 02:41:51.159]  There's shots of ospreys.
[02:41:52.100 --> 02:41:55.563]  As the troops leave, we have... They were there for two weeks.
[02:41:55.703 --> 02:41:56.384]  Called out now.
[02:41:56.904 --> 02:41:57.805]  So at least the U.S.
[02:41:57.845 --> 02:41:58.686]  military did show up.
[02:41:58.766 --> 02:41:59.787]  But Obama's pulled them out.
[02:42:00.187 --> 02:42:01.148]  And there's just nobody there.
[02:42:01.608 --> 02:42:03.290]  And it's just total devastation.
[02:42:03.670 --> 02:42:06.653]  Who's going to help us when we get hurt?
[02:42:06.673 --> 02:42:07.534]  That's what I mean.
[02:42:07.834 --> 02:42:11.938]  The more liberal we say we are now, the more empty and evil it gets.
[02:42:15.973 --> 02:42:23.037]  You know, Alex, my movie, Amerageddon, depicts America being attacked by an EMP.
[02:42:24.118 --> 02:42:31.923]  And I think God sent me here so I could see what life was like for a million people without electricity, without water, without food.
[02:42:33.444 --> 02:42:36.646]  And I'm living it.
[02:42:37.026 --> 02:42:39.087]  And I tell you what, I want to warn Americans.
[02:42:40.008 --> 02:42:44.290]  It ain't pretty when you don't have running water and you have no electricity.
[02:42:44.310 --> 02:42:45.611]  Your food has been spoiled.
[02:42:46.309 --> 02:42:54.214]  And I really believe, this has given me that experience so that I can continue to get the word out that people need to prepare.
[02:42:54.234 --> 02:43:05.281]  And you need to understand that the government is not only not here to help them, but because our government is controlled by a shadow government, an elite, whom Hillary is part of, George Soros is part of.
[02:43:06.021 --> 02:43:09.183]  These evil bastards want absolute power.
[02:43:09.203 --> 02:43:15.987]  You know that Alton quote, power corrupts and absolute power
[02:43:16.340 --> 02:43:17.261]  Perhaps absolutely.
[02:43:17.281 --> 02:43:27.167]  There's a third sentence on it that nobody ever knows about, but it says that, and powerful people are mostly evil people.
[02:43:27.988 --> 02:43:39.195]  And it's time for America to wake up and understand that this kind of disaster, and by the way, I've been dealing with mobs of starving people charging me in my airplane
[02:43:39.965 --> 02:43:41.248]  I think?
[02:43:49.406 --> 02:44:01.957]  Uh, do an EMP attack on our country, and that damn satellite flies over twice a day, and there's a very likely possibility that it has a miniaturized nuclear device on it, designed for EMP.
[02:44:02.438 --> 02:44:06.401]  Well, regardless, we can have one of these big Carrington events in the sun, we can have another.
[02:44:06.521 --> 02:44:09.444]  The point is that, look at Fukushima.
[02:44:09.804 --> 02:44:10.785]  They don't care anymore.
[02:44:10.825 --> 02:44:12.847]  It's like they're demons that want to hurt the planet.
[02:44:13.107 --> 02:44:14.488]  And I never used to talk like this.
[02:44:14.628 --> 02:44:15.069]  More and more,
[02:44:16.226 --> 02:44:23.792]  They want power just to hurt people, and you read their WikiLeaks, they admit, we want to make people poor, we want to dumb them down, we want to hurt them.
[02:44:25.573 --> 02:44:26.754]  I mean, they're just horrible.
[02:44:27.815 --> 02:44:30.577]  It's not just like they're greedy and make mistakes or whatever, they're bad.
[02:44:30.597 --> 02:44:40.805]  And that's why those of us that are not servants of the devil, I mean the servants of pure evil, do not get these people are not on the same level we're on.
[02:44:40.865 --> 02:44:42.507]  They are on a completely different plane.
[02:44:44.198 --> 02:44:47.059]  Yeah, you know, if you want to defeat your enemy, you've got to know your enemy.
[02:44:47.920 --> 02:44:54.783]  And it's difficult for Christians, for people with our values, to get into the heads of these people.
[02:44:55.243 --> 02:44:57.484]  Remember, they want depopulation.
[02:44:57.844 --> 02:45:03.366]  They want a sustainable population, what they call it, which is about 500 million people.
[02:45:04.067 --> 02:45:05.807]  Our world population right now is 7 billion.
[02:45:14.572 --> 02:45:17.216]  She's a useless eater according to Henry Kissinger.
[02:45:17.616 --> 02:45:25.187]  So this is a way for them to eliminate a million people that they think are not adding any value to society.
[02:45:25.948 --> 02:45:28.831]  Man, that's hard to get your head around that they want to kill.
[02:45:29.692 --> 02:45:34.678]  They said themselves that birth control is not going to get it done.
[02:45:35.479 --> 02:45:37.501]  They need to have more aggressive measures.
[02:45:44.349 --> 02:45:52.436]  This little photo, this little girl in one of the towns you were in, this is from just driving by in the car from the HD video, a still that Zimmerman has.
[02:45:52.796 --> 02:45:57.540]  He's got the UN troops riding around doing nothing with their machine guns, especially looting people as well.
[02:45:57.580 --> 02:45:59.862]  But the point is, is that all this is happening
[02:46:00.859 --> 02:46:02.220]  And that's one level.
[02:46:02.720 --> 02:46:06.622]  At the highest level, it's not even about let's be mean and kill people because we're overpopulated.
[02:46:06.842 --> 02:46:07.543]  That's their cover.
[02:46:07.883 --> 02:46:09.884]  The truth is they just like to kill, steal and destroy.
[02:46:10.204 --> 02:46:15.667]  We know this from the British Royal Institute report on population 1949.
[02:46:15.847 --> 02:46:23.311]  They said we can stabilize the third world, industrialize them, not have them overproduce populations that are unsustainable on unsustainable models.
[02:46:23.831 --> 02:46:24.972]  Because you can always build a new model.
[02:46:25.233 --> 02:46:28.176]  We're going to have a big bloom and then use that to destabilize the world.
[02:46:28.536 --> 02:46:30.859]  Use the cheap labor to leverage control of the West.
[02:46:31.199 --> 02:46:33.702]  And here we are 70 years later, brother, and they've done it.
[02:46:33.722 --> 02:46:35.084]  I mean, you've got to hand it to them.
[02:46:35.104 --> 02:46:38.107]  They've got a diabolical plan that is multi-generational.
[02:46:38.427 --> 02:46:41.391]  And it's inspired by something not of this world.
[02:46:41.631 --> 02:46:44.234]  And mainstream media makes jokes about it and says I'm saying space aliens.
[02:46:44.554 --> 02:46:44.974]  No, I'm not.
[02:46:45.014 --> 02:46:46.075]  I'm saying what the Bible says.
[02:46:46.155 --> 02:46:49.117]  An evil entity crash-landed on this planet.
[02:46:49.137 --> 02:46:50.158]  That's what the Bible says.
[02:46:50.538 --> 02:46:52.119]  And when you look at it, it is evil.
[02:46:52.319 --> 02:47:01.706]  And how did God tell, you know, on the Isle of Patmos, John the Revelator, everything, and tell Daniel and everybody else, describing exactly what we now see.
[02:47:02.026 --> 02:47:14.134]  Giant metal insects coming in and fire as big as mountains, and huge cities burning, and the image of the beast seen in everyone's homes worldwide speaking to them, and it describes computers and everything.
[02:47:14.494 --> 02:47:20.416]  And huge, giant populations, and you know, the Bible said that it was a round planet, and you know, and seven continents.
[02:47:20.676 --> 02:47:21.576]  I mean, it's all there.
[02:47:21.636 --> 02:47:24.457]  Before anybody had a satellite, anybody had been in a ship around the world.
[02:47:24.737 --> 02:47:29.339]  It's telling you what's happening, but as Christ said, it's not meant for the profane to be able to understand this.
[02:47:29.759 --> 02:47:31.360]  That's why they say, why do you speak in parables?
[02:47:31.560 --> 02:47:33.640]  Because it wasn't meant for the profane to even understand it.
[02:47:35.401 --> 02:47:42.644]  Yeah, you know, even people that don't understand what the Bible is to you and me and to Christians,
[02:47:45.927 --> 02:47:50.749]  The parts you just talked about from a logical perspective.
[02:47:51.349 --> 02:47:57.812]  Had it 2,000 years ago, they came up with the idea that there would be this economic system that would be controlled all over the world.
[02:47:59.032 --> 02:48:06.215]  I invite them just to read it from reason and weigh out the evidence that was predicted at this time.
[02:48:06.755 --> 02:48:08.655]  And it goes a long way of explaining things.
[02:48:10.096 --> 02:48:12.997]  If people realize that there's a spiritual dimension to this,
[02:48:13.664 --> 02:48:20.930]  And that spiritual dimension was forewarned 2,000 years ago, and it's very specific.
[02:48:21.690 --> 02:48:23.312]  And also the nature of people.
[02:48:23.332 --> 02:48:26.014]  You know, the Bible says the heart is exceedingly wicked.
[02:48:26.434 --> 02:48:28.376]  Let me tell you what, these people don't know Jesus.
[02:48:29.476 --> 02:48:33.540]  Many of them, like Hillary, are personally acquainted with Satan himself.
[02:48:33.620 --> 02:48:34.600]  I'm convinced of that.
[02:48:34.620 --> 02:48:35.141]  Well, they admit it.
[02:48:35.381 --> 02:48:36.902]  They're into the occult.
[02:48:37.743 --> 02:48:38.023]  Exactly.
[02:48:38.043 --> 02:48:39.384]  Well, let's take it from a science fiction angle.
[02:48:39.544 --> 02:48:40.725]  No, I'm not saying I believe this.
[02:48:40.745 --> 02:48:41.566]  I'm saying it's an allegory.
[02:48:42.802 --> 02:48:47.625]  Okay, there's God, and then there's this evil thing that's below and wants to hurt God's creation.
[02:48:47.685 --> 02:48:48.225]  It's come here.
[02:48:48.726 --> 02:48:53.128]  God's not going to just leave us in the hands of this thing that wants to seduce us through free will to destroy us.
[02:48:53.368 --> 02:48:59.672]  We're going to get a warning about the technology that God knows this fallen creature that God made is going to use on us.
[02:49:00.112 --> 02:49:02.173]  And so God said, hey, here's what they're going to do.
[02:49:02.514 --> 02:49:02.954]  Be ready.
[02:49:03.574 --> 02:49:05.355]  So that those of us that understand it, get it.
[02:49:05.495 --> 02:49:07.937]  And then we have this big animating contest of liberty.
[02:49:10.512 --> 02:49:10.812]  That's right.
[02:49:10.832 --> 02:49:14.834]  You know, the Bible says, be not ignorant of the enemy's devices.
[02:49:15.355 --> 02:49:23.719]  And I'll tell you what, you and I, a lot of people out there have been teaching Americans that were willing to listen what those devices are.
[02:49:24.366 --> 02:49:26.849]  And you know, God's, He always promised there'd be a remnant.
[02:49:27.389 --> 02:49:30.232]  And He promises that He and us is greater than He is in the world.
[02:49:30.873 --> 02:49:32.354]  We've got to exercise our power.
[02:49:32.374 --> 02:49:42.184]  You know, I've gotten a number of emails that I need to be afraid for my life because this is a great place for the Clinton crime family to put a kid on.
[02:49:42.985 --> 02:49:52.456]  You know what, my name is determined by my God and can even save himself in collaboration with this.
[02:49:52.536 --> 02:49:53.777]  Yeah Gary, your Skype's gone.
[02:49:53.817 --> 02:49:54.838]  We can't pick you up again.
[02:49:54.899 --> 02:49:56.941]  Hold on, we might have to reconnect.
[02:49:57.321 --> 02:50:00.124]  But absolutely, people don't think the way...
[02:50:00.825 --> 02:50:02.266]  I guess we do that are actually at this level.
[02:50:02.726 --> 02:50:04.146]  Everybody keeps saying the Clintons can get you.
[02:50:04.166 --> 02:50:04.767]  They kill people.
[02:50:04.807 --> 02:50:05.267]  Don't you know?
[02:50:05.307 --> 02:50:06.587]  Yes, we know is the point.
[02:50:06.887 --> 02:50:09.048]  We're doing this because somebody's got to stand up to them.
[02:50:09.328 --> 02:50:10.529]  Somebody's got to say no.
[02:50:11.129 --> 02:50:13.810]  And so it's kind of irritating when people say, hey, you know, you better watch it.
[02:50:14.070 --> 02:50:16.791]  What you don't think I don't know that they got me fired from a job.
[02:50:17.031 --> 02:50:18.832]  They had a crew come and physically attack me.
[02:50:19.032 --> 02:50:20.092]  Gary, I think your Skype's back.
[02:50:20.112 --> 02:50:22.893]  You were just making that point that, of course, you know you're in danger.
[02:50:23.093 --> 02:50:24.574]  I mean, Haiti's one of the most dangerous people in the world.
[02:50:24.954 --> 02:50:26.074]  You're landing on dirt airfields.
[02:50:26.094 --> 02:50:27.235]  Looks like a James Bond movie.
[02:50:27.475 --> 02:50:28.855]  Of course you know what the hell you're doing.
[02:50:29.116 --> 02:50:29.976]  This is the real deal.
[02:50:32.155 --> 02:50:35.906]  You know, folks steal our thunder when they think we don't know what we're doing.
[02:50:35.926 --> 02:50:36.167]  Go ahead.
[02:50:38.328 --> 02:50:40.049]  Yeah, I'll tell you how dangerous this is.
[02:50:40.069 --> 02:50:49.996]  Not, and I want to be clear, not me or my three aircraft that are here, but another volunteer crashed the night before last.
[02:50:51.077 --> 02:50:57.641]  And three people that were here on their own, their own money, volunteering, died in the sea.
[02:50:57.721 --> 02:50:59.102]  They flew through a thunderstorm.
[02:50:59.182 --> 02:51:01.363]  So this is serious stuff.
[02:51:01.463 --> 02:51:04.666]  And we're doing landings to get children out of here and get food.
[02:51:04.686 --> 02:51:05.546]  No, this is serious.
[02:51:05.566 --> 02:51:07.047]  We're going to play some of the footage straight ahead.
[02:51:07.067 --> 02:51:07.948]  Stay there, Gary Haven.
[02:51:09.388 --> 02:51:10.829]  I said to Donald, here's what they're doing.
[02:51:10.849 --> 02:51:12.129]  They're setting it up as follows.
[02:51:12.769 --> 02:51:18.611]  For three, four months they've been saying the Russians are hacking our elections to protect our elections, which is sacred.
[02:51:19.031 --> 02:51:20.712]  We want to turn it over to DHS.
[02:51:20.732 --> 02:51:24.633]  The genius has given us one terrorist attack after another and has done nothing to stop it.
[02:51:24.653 --> 02:51:25.694]  He still has his job, right?
[02:51:26.214 --> 02:51:28.674]  So he wants to make sure our elections are safe.
[02:51:28.975 --> 02:51:29.795]  Russians are hacking.
[02:51:30.515 --> 02:51:31.635]  Follow the bouncing ball.
[02:51:31.695 --> 02:51:32.275]  No proof.
[02:51:32.655 --> 02:51:50.719]  If Trump wins, which is highly likely by the way, which we can talk about in a minute or two or another time, Trump wins, government declares, oh we have evidence that the Russians hacked it, he's a friend of Putin, the election is null and void, we're going to recall another election in what, six months?
[02:51:50.779 --> 02:51:53.820]  Until then, Mr. Obama has graciously agreed
[02:51:54.820 --> 02:51:58.103]  To continue his public service in the United States of America.
[02:51:58.423 --> 02:51:59.223]  Thank you very much.
[02:51:59.283 --> 02:52:00.404]  We're not taking any questions.
[02:52:00.444 --> 02:52:00.905]  Goodbye.
[02:52:02.986 --> 02:52:11.693]  And we have Biden announcing they're going to launch a giant cyber attack on the Russians and saying if the Russians respond, they may respond militarily, which is a doctrine Hillary came out with two months ago.
[02:52:12.093 --> 02:52:14.374]  And suddenly NATO announced that's their new doctrine.
[02:52:14.615 --> 02:52:16.076]  She's literally calling the show.
[02:52:17.406 --> 02:52:20.289]  All I wanted to say was, I said it to Donald and he didn't take the bait.
[02:52:20.309 --> 02:52:20.910]  I'm glad he didn't.
[02:52:20.970 --> 02:52:24.354]  I said, don't even answer me, because they'll crucify you if you agree with me.
[02:52:25.355 --> 02:52:27.057]  They're going to steal the election.
[02:52:27.237 --> 02:52:28.018]  I'll make it simple.
[02:52:28.078 --> 02:52:30.822]  In the fifth grade, I ran for class president in Queens, New York.
[02:52:31.823 --> 02:52:32.764]  I was a funny kid.
[02:52:32.824 --> 02:52:33.665]  I was a wild kid.
[02:52:33.685 --> 02:52:34.446]  I was out of control.
[02:52:34.506 --> 02:52:36.008]  I won the election by a landslide.
[02:52:36.548 --> 02:52:40.450]  The teacher stood up and said, this election doesn't count.
[02:52:40.910 --> 02:52:43.971]  And she had another election, and I wasn't class president.
[02:52:44.391 --> 02:52:49.093]  So, hey, look, if it could be done in the fifth grade in the Bronx when I was a kid, why can't they do it to us now, right?
[02:52:49.133 --> 02:52:49.793]  We're just children.
[02:52:49.813 --> 02:52:51.394]  I had a similar thing happen.
[02:52:51.434 --> 02:52:54.715]  You know, when you really do things in this world, you start to learn how rigged they are.
[02:52:54.915 --> 02:52:58.217]  And it's just crazy to see them go, even though they're the same newscast.
[02:52:58.917 --> 02:53:00.237]  The Russians are rigging the election.
[02:53:00.558 --> 02:53:02.498]  We're having to bring in the UN to oversee it.
[02:53:02.538 --> 02:53:03.919]  And then meanwhile, Trump's crazy.
[02:53:04.179 --> 02:53:07.640]  He says they're rigging the election even as we catch election officials admitting the fraud.
[02:53:07.840 --> 02:53:09.160]  We do have a minute or two more if you've got it.
[02:53:09.660 --> 02:53:10.701]  Elaborate on what you're saying.
[02:53:10.721 --> 02:53:11.341]  I mean, I agree.
[02:53:11.381 --> 02:53:14.662]  The internal polls, I know from Trump, but also other big groups are doing internal polls.
[02:53:15.182 --> 02:53:17.262]  5, 10, 15 points ahead in most battleground states.
[02:53:17.583 --> 02:53:18.823]  He's going to win in a landslide.
[02:53:19.083 --> 02:53:22.764]  They're only creating the perception he's way behind, so we buy it right now.
[02:53:22.784 --> 02:53:23.644]  Do you concur with that?
[02:53:23.804 --> 02:53:25.425]  A. B. What happens when he gets in?
[02:53:26.126 --> 02:53:26.526]  100% right.
[02:53:26.546 --> 02:53:27.668]  You and I think the same way.
[02:53:27.728 --> 02:53:29.570]  I said that to Donald yesterday on my radio show.
[02:53:29.630 --> 02:53:29.851]  I said...
[02:53:31.559 --> 02:53:32.059]  Uh, Donald.
[02:53:32.300 --> 02:53:36.743]  I said, what they're doing is they're not trying to get Hillary people to vote for Hillary.
[02:53:36.783 --> 02:53:38.725]  They've got all the people they could ever, ever get.
[02:53:38.745 --> 02:53:44.909]  I said, what they're trying to do is discourage Trump voters from voting by thinking that it's, it's over already.
[02:53:44.949 --> 02:53:47.551]  They're trying to make them think that he lost, that she won.
[02:53:47.571 --> 02:53:49.793]  So they're going to throw their hands up and not vote for him.
[02:53:50.073 --> 02:53:53.596]  He's got to make sure that people think he can still win, which he can.
[02:53:54.517 --> 02:53:59.360]  And then if all of us who are supporting him come out, I think he will win.
[02:53:59.600 --> 02:54:00.241]  It's that simple.
[02:54:00.441 --> 02:54:01.983]  That's right, you can't steal landslides.
[02:54:02.003 --> 02:54:06.948]  I've interviewed experts who are Democrats, Republicans, die-bold engineers from the highest levels, they agree.
[02:54:07.629 --> 02:54:09.311]  You cannot steal a landslide.
[02:54:12.715 --> 02:54:14.097]  Tonight, live coverage.
[02:54:16.325 --> 02:54:19.327]  Kicking off at 11 a.m., so we're now three hours into it.
[02:54:20.168 --> 02:54:21.289]  Right through to midnight.
[02:54:21.609 --> 02:54:25.572]  Infowars.com forward slash show to find the free internal feeds we have.
[02:54:25.592 --> 02:54:27.453]  We also have YouTube feeds and others.
[02:54:28.334 --> 02:54:32.517]  We're going to be dialing into the internal Trump feed that we have access to.
[02:54:34.104 --> 02:54:35.785]  The media always has a heyday with stuff like that.
[02:54:35.845 --> 02:54:36.866]  Look at Alex Jones and his crew.
[02:54:36.906 --> 02:54:39.889]  They have backstage total supreme passes at the RNC.
[02:54:40.329 --> 02:54:40.850]  No!
[02:54:41.250 --> 02:54:42.591]  The Republican Party hated it too.
[02:54:42.912 --> 02:54:45.113]  But the point is, is this is part of taking the country back.
[02:54:45.534 --> 02:54:48.937]  And Trump has really broken through the electronic Berlin Wall.
[02:54:48.997 --> 02:54:51.479]  Even if they steal it from him, it's a huge victory.
[02:54:51.899 --> 02:54:55.502]  And the WikiLeaks, there's no way Hillary won't get impeached now.
[02:54:55.603 --> 02:54:59.025]  I mean, it's just a thousand crimes on top of a thousand outrages.
[02:54:59.366 --> 02:55:00.307]  We have them now.
[02:55:00.467 --> 02:55:01.387]  And more is coming.
[02:55:02.108 --> 02:55:03.969]  So it's, it's, it's the battle's joined.
[02:55:04.250 --> 02:55:06.291]  Gary Haber will be with us about 15 minutes to the next hour.
[02:55:06.311 --> 02:55:09.753]  I want to play this special report on Haiti that I don't even know what to name it.
[02:55:10.054 --> 02:55:11.194]  I mean, I want to put an article out.
[02:55:11.214 --> 02:55:12.235]  I want to get attention to this.
[02:55:12.555 --> 02:55:17.239]  Not just to expose the Clintons, but to know that the American people gave billions of dollars.
[02:55:17.279 --> 02:55:18.660]  The Clintons stole most of it.
[02:55:19.280 --> 02:55:22.843]  They got people in the media that they control to say, give it to us.
[02:55:23.083 --> 02:55:23.803]  And then they kept it.
[02:55:23.843 --> 02:55:25.985]  It's just, it's unbelievable.
[02:55:26.988 --> 02:55:34.994]  Imagine if Putin started a charity and kept, you know, of $2 billion of it, kept $100 million, $900 and something, you know.
[02:55:36.035 --> 02:55:40.278]  I mean, it's just, it's 94% they kept.
[02:55:40.399 --> 02:55:41.700]  It makes my head spin.
[02:55:42.200 --> 02:55:47.344]  Speaking of funding for this platform to promote everybody else, we are selling a new shirt.
[02:55:47.364 --> 02:55:48.065]  In fact, here it is.
[02:55:49.205 --> 02:55:50.266]  And it's a one-time run.
[02:55:50.326 --> 02:55:51.547]  It says, Trump is my president.
[02:55:51.888 --> 02:55:53.269]  So you can have this in time for the election.
[02:55:54.497 --> 02:55:55.498]  Trump is my president.
[02:55:55.818 --> 02:55:57.219]  There's legalized freedom on the back.
[02:55:57.299 --> 02:55:58.219]  Infowars.com.
[02:55:58.620 --> 02:55:59.040]  Spread the word.
[02:55:59.080 --> 02:55:59.560]  It's in red.
[02:55:59.580 --> 02:56:02.462]  We have the Hillary for Prison shirt that's limited edition about to end.

[02:56:05.444 --> 02:56:07.986]  And we also have a lot more, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:08.006 --> 02:56:12.869]  I've got to come back to Gary Heyman here in just a moment because I haven't plugged any sponsors today.
[02:56:13.330 --> 02:56:17.652]  I need to do this big time and take advantage of 25% off Brain Force.

[02:56:43.245 --> 02:56:47.126]  I believe an economic crash is coming and you should protect yourself with real money.
[02:56:47.527 --> 02:56:50.508]  Do you want to be a victim or do you want to be prepared?

[02:57:46.710 --> 02:57:46.970]  And then...
[02:57:48.095 --> 02:57:50.976]  A movie that's so important and needs to be seen, Revelation.
[02:57:51.076 --> 02:57:52.537]  I'm in it, General Boykin, you name it.
[02:57:52.837 --> 02:57:55.378]  The DVDs are now available and we're showing around the country.
[02:57:55.818 --> 02:58:04.201]  You want to go to revelationthemovie.info, revelationthemovie.info to purchase the DVD or check out
[02:58:04.241 --> 02:58:05.282]  And will this film save the world?
[02:58:05.382 --> 02:58:05.462]  No!
[02:58:28.663 --> 02:58:30.964]  But will America Eden do it?
[02:58:31.004 --> 02:58:31.084]  No.
[02:58:31.104 --> 02:58:31.624]  Will this show?
[02:58:31.684 --> 02:58:31.824]  No.
[02:58:31.864 --> 02:58:34.664]  But all of us together, doing the right thing, speaking out, will.
[02:58:34.764 --> 02:58:38.665]  Back to Gary Haven in 70 seconds as we kick off the fourth hour.
[02:58:38.905 --> 02:58:46.487]  We'll premiere the full special report on the devastation the Clintons have left in Haiti and what nightmare monsters they are straight ahead.
[02:58:46.787 --> 02:58:49.068]  Infowars.com forward slash show for the debate tonight.
[02:58:49.328 --> 02:58:51.648]  It's ongoing live coverage from now straight through it.
[02:58:51.908 --> 02:58:52.969]  The final showdown.
[02:58:52.989 --> 02:58:53.669]  19 days left!
[02:58:59.306 --> 02:59:06.410]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[02:59:06.771 --> 02:59:19.979]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[02:59:20.919 --> 02:59:32.165]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[02:59:32.826 --> 02:59:38.769]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[02:59:39.529 --> 02:59:47.935]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[02:59:48.556 --> 02:59:56.841]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[03:00:01.465 --> 03:00:04.087]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:22.279 --> 03:00:23.020]  Big Brother.
[03:00:23.400 --> 03:00:24.641]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:25.181 --> 03:00:26.242]  Government cover-up.
[03:00:27.123 --> 03:00:28.544]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:00:28.804 --> 03:00:29.965]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:30.465 --> 03:00:35.008]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:37.030 --> 03:00:41.113]  Gary Haber's with us for two more segments.
[03:00:42.387 --> 03:00:44.188]  And he's just trying to purely draw attention to this.
[03:00:44.228 --> 03:00:46.970]  He put out his film, great costume, self-emerageddon.
[03:00:47.630 --> 03:00:49.672]  Tried to expose the UN globalist takeover.
[03:00:51.033 --> 03:00:52.233]  He's just done so much more.
[03:00:52.253 --> 03:00:54.235]  He helped expose Ted Cruz at a critical point.
[03:00:54.655 --> 03:00:58.918]  He's joined us via phone because the sky has been degrading so bad in the hurricane hit area.
[03:00:59.418 --> 03:01:01.139]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[03:01:01.179 --> 03:01:03.040]  We're going to premiere the special report.
[03:01:03.500 --> 03:01:05.101]  What do you think we call this controversy?
[03:01:05.121 --> 03:01:08.684]  Because I'm trying, you know, so much is headlines, so much is how to put this out.
[03:01:09.755 --> 03:01:13.476]  You know, I mean, the Clintons, I think, you know, the Clintons are again stealing the money.
[03:01:13.496 --> 03:01:14.756]  I think that's the new controversy.
[03:01:14.956 --> 03:01:19.397]  The Clintons are again stealing the money from the Haitians, again, while the U.N.
[03:01:19.457 --> 03:01:20.598]  stands down medical care.
[03:01:20.638 --> 03:01:22.198]  I think that's really the headline.
[03:01:22.478 --> 03:01:23.138]  Make some points.
[03:01:23.158 --> 03:01:26.299]  We can cut this into the report today and then put it out on the nightly news.
[03:01:27.879 --> 03:01:33.000]  You know, I'm, as a CEO and a brand builder, I'm pretty good at this stuff.
[03:01:33.040 --> 03:01:35.721]  I think I would call it Haiti, the hidden disaster.
[03:01:36.381 --> 03:01:37.642]  And then the byline would be,
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:47.008]  The cover by the Hillary media.
[03:01:47.028 --> 03:01:49.610]  That's right, the Hillary media covers up Clinton crime.
[03:01:50.852 --> 03:01:52.654]  Yep, that's what this is about.
[03:01:52.754 --> 03:01:58.740]  You know Alex, if there were, even Fox News, if they were to show up, I mean none of them are here.
[03:02:00.325 --> 03:02:02.807]  They would tell Americans what's going on.
[03:02:02.887 --> 03:02:10.573]  And, you know, as you mentioned, Americans, particularly the evangelicals, are the ones that respond to need.
[03:02:10.593 --> 03:02:15.497]  You know, we all have to be obedient to caring for the lesser among us.
[03:02:15.597 --> 03:02:19.880]  And this is an opportunity for Americans to respond.
[03:02:20.421 --> 03:02:22.602]  I'll give you a name of a charity.
[03:02:22.963 --> 03:02:26.846]  It's called F-E-R-H-A, FARA.org.
[03:02:28.243 --> 03:02:28.643]  There it is.
[03:02:29.084 --> 03:02:30.705]  And people can donate to that.
[03:02:30.765 --> 03:02:34.628]  And that's a charity that I've been supporting for five and a half years.
[03:02:34.728 --> 03:02:36.130]  And it's based right there.
[03:02:37.631 --> 03:02:37.771]  Yep.
[03:02:38.151 --> 03:02:42.375]  So people can do something by sending them some resources.
[03:02:43.376 --> 03:02:48.040]  You know, the UN has only secured $12 million for this disaster.
[03:02:48.080 --> 03:02:50.121]  There's $1.4 million affected.
[03:02:50.742 --> 03:02:53.704]  Alex, that's less than $10 a person.
[03:02:53.865 --> 03:02:55.406]  That's what the world is committed to this.
[03:02:58.186 --> 03:03:05.093]  Well, again, what adds insult to injury is that they use Haiti to suck money out of people and then don't even give them half of it.
[03:03:05.233 --> 03:03:08.376]  And then they prance around like they're angels.
[03:03:08.656 --> 03:03:09.417]  It makes me sick.
[03:03:11.619 --> 03:03:16.284]  And you know, I gotta tell you, I ain't seen a Red Cross or a Blue Cross or any kind of
[03:03:17.088 --> 03:03:23.675]  No, it's all individuals, and there's a lot of great people that have stopped their lives and come here and help.
[03:03:23.755 --> 03:03:36.228]  Doctors, nurses, medical workers, and I'm really proud of these people, but I'll tell you what, it's hundreds when we need thousands, and there's no help coming from the media or
[03:03:37.349 --> 03:03:42.293]  And by the way, that's a normal human instinct God gave us, to want to go help people that are in trouble, that we have the means.
[03:03:42.794 --> 03:03:44.775]  And it seems like they are driving that instinct out.
[03:03:45.136 --> 03:03:50.981]  I mean, they have studies that the more industrialized we get, people just watch a raped woman, you know, bleed to death for two hours in the street.
[03:03:51.321 --> 03:03:55.465]  And the CEO of a Toronto company told his employees, don't even call the cops, it's a diversion.
[03:03:56.385 --> 03:03:57.146]  And the woman died.
[03:03:57.166 --> 03:03:58.047]  I mean, this is getting weird.
[03:03:59.857 --> 03:04:04.401]  Yeah, you know, a woman gets raped while people stand around and are afraid to do things.
[03:04:05.042 --> 03:04:07.344]  You know, I'm a Texan, and you're a Texan.
[03:04:08.705 --> 03:04:10.086]  We're men in our state.
[03:04:10.226 --> 03:04:12.448]  We haven't been feminized.
[03:04:13.469 --> 03:04:16.391]  And we're not afraid to stand up to this evil.
[03:04:16.411 --> 03:04:19.754]  We're not afraid to stand up and defend these children and women.
[03:04:20.474 --> 03:04:21.675]  And I'm proud of that.
[03:04:21.935 --> 03:04:23.136]  And I think God's proud of all of us.
[03:04:23.196 --> 03:04:24.997]  I get so angry I get tears in my eyes.
[03:04:25.237 --> 03:04:26.878]  It's not because I'm some goody two-shoe.
[03:04:27.258 --> 03:04:28.719]  I know that we're losing our soul.
[03:04:28.759 --> 03:04:29.219]  I'm going to break.
[03:04:29.239 --> 03:04:30.240]  I want to ask this when we come back.
[03:04:32.796 --> 03:04:35.138]  What do we do to put attention on this, Gary?
[03:04:35.519 --> 03:04:37.380]  Because, I mean, there's more we can do than the Lister's can do.
[03:04:38.001 --> 03:04:39.282]  And then how do we shame the Clintons?
[03:04:39.322 --> 03:04:44.046]  I'm thinking about some new contest to shame them for stealing the Haiti money.
[03:04:44.327 --> 03:04:44.807]  That's it.
[03:04:44.947 --> 03:04:46.268]  Bigger than exposing the rape.
[03:04:46.869 --> 03:04:52.254]  Should I offer another $100,000 for people confronting them on national TV about stealing the Haitian money?
[03:04:54.676 --> 03:04:56.438]  I think that's what we need to do, don't we?
[03:04:58.268 --> 03:04:59.149]  We'll talk about it in a minute.
[03:04:59.329 --> 03:05:00.850]  We'll be right back with Gary Haven.
[03:05:00.891 --> 03:05:07.277]  He's down there and had some other questions I wanted to ask as well, but I tell you, these people are just the scum of the earth.
[03:05:09.232 --> 03:05:10.532]  We're red on election day.
[03:05:10.652 --> 03:05:13.613]  Perhaps the biggest election in American history is just days away.
[03:05:13.773 --> 03:05:18.354]  We know that in past elections, there have been thousands of cases of voter fraud and election fraud.
[03:05:18.374 --> 03:05:25.776]  From dead people voting, to people registering false identifications, to government leaders providing fast-track amnesty to give illegal immigrants votes.
[03:05:25.796 --> 03:05:27.256]  This is happening right in front of us.
[03:05:27.456 --> 03:05:31.857]  Now we are seeing the establishment send all its hitmen after the Republican nominee, Donald Trump.
[03:05:31.937 --> 03:05:33.839]  Government shills are campaigning for Clinton.
[03:05:33.939 --> 03:05:37.123]  Mainstream news attacking Donald Trump all day like rabbit hounds.
[03:05:37.303 --> 03:05:44.031]  Rigged polls being broadcast daily to provide the fake optics that Hillary Clinton is actually winning and to discourage people from voting Trump.
[03:05:44.191 --> 03:05:46.734]  Fake celebrities endorsing Clinton across all platforms.
[03:05:46.954 --> 03:05:50.196]  So with all this, what are we doing to keep this election from being stolen?
[03:05:50.417 --> 03:05:52.278]  What can we do to prevent election fraud?
[03:05:52.418 --> 03:05:55.540]  I propose that all Donald Trump supporters wear red on Election Day.
[03:05:55.640 --> 03:05:59.423]  On November 8th, when you head to the polls to vote Donald Trump, be decked out in red.
[03:05:59.523 --> 03:06:05.587]  This way, just as we dominated in rally turnout, we can prove and provide the optics that we also dominated in voter turnout.
[03:06:05.708 --> 03:06:08.590]  Wear red on Election Day, and Make America Great Again!
[03:06:09.270 --> 03:06:13.174]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[03:06:13.415 --> 03:06:20.742]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[03:06:20.902 --> 03:06:31.834]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[03:06:32.334 --> 03:06:39.877]  In the history of InfoWars life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[03:06:40.157 --> 03:06:49.501]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today, with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[03:06:49.821 --> 03:06:54.005]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.

[03:07:01.332 --> 03:07:02.453]  That means it's clean.
[03:07:02.793 --> 03:07:03.874]  That means it's pure.
[03:07:03.954 --> 03:07:06.697]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:07:06.857 --> 03:07:08.539]  Take action now before we sell out.

[03:07:13.778 --> 03:07:15.961]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:07:16.081 --> 03:07:22.910]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[03:07:23.130 --> 03:07:26.394]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[03:07:26.414 --> 03:07:27.576]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[03:07:27.876 --> 03:07:34.282]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[03:07:34.522 --> 03:07:35.283]  This is sustainable.
[03:07:35.443 --> 03:07:39.426]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[03:07:39.646 --> 03:07:42.809]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[03:07:42.869 --> 03:07:45.892]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[03:07:46.032 --> 03:07:47.433]  We're looking at the television screen.
[03:07:47.453 --> 03:07:53.175]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:07:53.195 --> 03:07:58.338]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:58.558 --> 03:08:01.460]  Or call 888-253-3139.

[03:08:06.942 --> 03:08:08.343]  And we thank you for your support.
[03:08:10.711 --> 03:08:18.093]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:39.120 --> 03:08:41.865]  Yes, sir!
[03:08:45.925 --> 03:08:47.627]  Gary Haben is our guest for a few more minutes.
[03:08:47.647 --> 03:08:51.951]  We're going to go to this special report, then go to break and bring Anthony Ucciardi in to balance out this hour.
[03:08:51.971 --> 03:08:58.257]  Then we've got a big lineup today of exclusive guests, reporters, live feeds before, during, and after.
[03:08:58.277 --> 03:09:06.125]  We're going to have feeds into the Trump area that nobody has but us and Right Side directly from the Trump folks with a special press conference they're going to do after.
[03:09:06.545 --> 03:09:07.846]  They've got surprises before.
[03:09:08.827 --> 03:09:13.090]  We'll mix all the feeds together at InfoWars.com from here in Austin, Texas.
[03:09:13.570 --> 03:09:16.572]  And of course, you can tune into other feeds as well that we'll have on the site.
[03:09:16.652 --> 03:09:19.053]  But InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:09:19.693 --> 03:09:21.654]  You're part of this revolution against the mainstream media.
[03:09:21.714 --> 03:09:23.235]  Spread that link to everybody.
[03:09:23.315 --> 03:09:31.580]  InfoWars.com forward slash show for inside scoop at the debate for feeds and cameras and things MSM won't show you.
[03:09:32.060 --> 03:09:33.601]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:09:33.981 --> 03:09:34.502]  Gary Haven.
[03:09:36.215 --> 03:09:42.806]  We really should pull some stunts to expose Hillary and also then obviously get more aid to Haiti who was robbed.
[03:09:43.067 --> 03:09:44.449]  I want to ask you a few questions though.
[03:09:46.733 --> 03:09:47.595]  Mainstream media
[03:09:49.582 --> 03:10:00.891]  says that it's 2 billion the Clintons took and that they took 94% and that they gave 3 to 5% depending on the year of their own money to charity and then that itself was to them.
[03:10:01.011 --> 03:10:03.453]  So it's a total money laundering operation.
[03:10:03.973 --> 03:10:12.920]  But even the LA Times and others report that really what happened to the 3.9 billion that were supposed to go to Haiti that the Clinton Foundation got?
[03:10:12.980 --> 03:10:14.121]  So what's the real number?
[03:10:14.441 --> 03:10:16.503]  Is 2 billion conservative or what's happening?
[03:10:17.972 --> 03:10:21.294]  Yeah, I use 2 billion because it's conservative.
[03:10:21.614 --> 03:10:24.656]  I think I can prove that, which is important for my credibility.
[03:10:26.337 --> 03:10:27.818]  But it's very likely north of that.
[03:10:28.799 --> 03:10:35.263]  And I would recommend people use the 2 billion plus number and talk about that.
[03:10:35.963 --> 03:10:41.126]  You know, the head of the Haitian Senate did that press event with Trump the other day.
[03:10:41.186 --> 03:10:42.027]  By the way, I'm meeting
[03:10:43.068 --> 03:10:47.169]  This afternoon with the Haitian senator over that area.
[03:10:48.309 --> 03:10:52.190]  That's how significant our contribution has been to his area.
[03:10:52.250 --> 03:10:55.690]  We're there with our resources, saving his people.
[03:10:55.810 --> 03:10:57.531]  And so he's getting behind us on this.
[03:10:58.631 --> 03:11:02.872]  You know Alex, one of the problems here is the Haitian government has refused to declare an emergency.
[03:11:03.492 --> 03:11:08.373]  Because when they do, they give up sovereignty over the United Nations.
[03:11:08.393 --> 03:11:09.453]  They're not willing to do that.
[03:11:10.126 --> 03:11:18.313]  So, the resources are limited, the Haitians are afraid of the power they'll lose and the vulnerability they have to the United Nations, which is a pretty good worry.
[03:11:19.254 --> 03:11:21.896]  Yeah, how many times has Haiti been overthrown by the West or the UN?
[03:11:21.916 --> 03:11:22.557]  Quite a few times.
[03:11:24.238 --> 03:11:26.540]  Yeah, you know, it's a mess.
[03:11:26.560 --> 03:11:31.645]  You know, the number one religion here is voodoo, which brings us back to the spiritual element.
[03:11:33.723 --> 03:11:40.329]  I was surrounded by 200 people yesterday out in this place where we're feeding 4,000.
[03:11:41.089 --> 03:11:43.452]  And, you know, the voices were loud.
[03:11:43.492 --> 03:11:44.192]  They were angry.
[03:11:44.653 --> 03:11:53.701]  And curiously, in a park beside me, they were playing voodoo drums.
[03:11:54.829 --> 03:12:00.373]  While we were trying to get the crowd under control, my patient doctor who was with me was masterful.
[03:12:00.413 --> 03:12:10.579]  She got the crowd to calm down and she was able to explain that I was the one feeding them, told them my name, and then 200 people began to chant my name.
[03:12:14.401 --> 03:12:16.623]  The experiences here are just really hard to describe.
[03:12:17.403 --> 03:12:23.868]  And even though it's hard, and even though it's a hellhole in many respects, I would imagine, though, it feeds the soul to be doing good work and to be in the real world.
[03:12:23.928 --> 03:12:29.272]  Because, you know, a big pink pillow in the sky, New World Order, Matrix Land, is not the real world.
[03:12:29.312 --> 03:12:31.094]  It does not buoy the human spirit.
[03:12:31.374 --> 03:12:34.496]  But actually doing good work and trailblazing like you're doing, Gary, is.
[03:12:34.536 --> 03:12:36.218]  And I really appreciate you bringing the crew in there.
[03:12:36.838 --> 03:12:48.881]  I knew it was dangerous, but my God, watching the HD footage of you guys coming in on mud, grass, runways, by the edge of cliffs, and starving people, and dying people, and little starving children, and the haunting images.
[03:12:48.901 --> 03:12:58.844]  We've got more of the armored vehicles, and the UN people, and the little children, five, six-year-olds, their mothers and fathers are dead, wandering around in the rubble.
[03:12:58.964 --> 03:13:00.164]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[03:13:02.413 --> 03:13:08.575]  It's extraordinary, Alex, but I tell you, you know, I could be anywhere in the world doing anything I want to do.
[03:13:08.595 --> 03:13:12.897]  I wouldn't trade any of it for this experience.
[03:13:13.317 --> 03:13:14.557]  I've been here 10 days now.
[03:13:15.398 --> 03:13:16.718]  I don't know when I'm going to leave.
[03:13:17.118 --> 03:13:18.199]  I can't leave.
[03:13:18.279 --> 03:13:21.700]  People are depending on me for food and me only.
[03:13:22.240 --> 03:13:24.421]  You know, I was telling somebody, we're saving these lives.
[03:13:25.081 --> 03:13:30.443]  And it's not like a doctor doing a surgery and saving a life because there's other doctors.
[03:13:31.826 --> 03:13:37.431]  Here, doing this, there's me and my pilots and some great people that are teamed up.
[03:13:38.032 --> 03:13:40.114]  If not for us, there would be nobody.
[03:13:40.154 --> 03:13:49.222]  So these lives we're saving are even more incredible because they wouldn't be alive if we weren't here to be doing this.
[03:13:50.345 --> 03:13:54.527]  I tell you, it's humbling, but it's the most satisfying thing I think I've ever done in my life.
[03:13:54.607 --> 03:14:02.110]  The joy of holding a little baby and putting him on the plane and knowing that we're going to take him to a life-saving operation.
[03:14:02.831 --> 03:14:04.371]  I tell you, it's a thrill.
[03:14:05.752 --> 03:14:10.494]  The negative is being an eyewitness to the corruption.
[03:14:11.238 --> 03:14:18.749]  In the Hillary Clinton program, the Clinton Foundation, we go back to what can our listeners do?
[03:14:19.210 --> 03:14:21.994]  They need to make this stuff go viral.
[03:14:22.014 --> 03:14:26.020]  Joe Biggs filmed, it looks like Hiroshima.
[03:14:26.841 --> 03:14:30.923]  And you're putting on stuff that could be sent viral.
[03:14:31.383 --> 03:14:32.763]  We need to get social media.
[03:14:33.304 --> 03:14:40.666]  And again, the hidden disaster in how the media is providing cover for Hillary Clinton.
[03:14:40.746 --> 03:14:46.749]  And the media, because of Hillary's cover, is killing more people than the hurricane did.
[03:14:49.010 --> 03:14:50.190]  Gary Haven, thank you so much.
[03:14:50.230 --> 03:14:51.931]  I'm going to air this special report now.
[03:14:52.011 --> 03:14:54.452]  God bless you, and we'll talk to you again very, very soon.
[03:14:55.762 --> 03:14:56.262]  Great, Alex.
[03:14:56.282 --> 03:14:57.263]  Thanks for all you do, buddy.
[03:14:57.423 --> 03:14:57.863]  Thank you.
[03:14:58.143 --> 03:15:04.666]  That's Gary Haven from Port-au-Prince, there in Haiti, and we've got hours and hours of HD footage.
[03:15:04.746 --> 03:15:10.989]  I'm going to air about 7-8 minutes of this footage right now, and then Anthony Ucciardi is going to take over.
[03:15:11.009 --> 03:15:22.434]  Obviously, we're going to skip this network break, but I sit back and I look at this world, and I sit back and I see what's unfolding and what's happening.
[03:15:24.724 --> 03:15:31.386]  And you really see what people are made of when things get down to brass tacks like this.
[03:15:33.127 --> 03:15:34.928]  That's exactly what the statistics show.
[03:15:36.328 --> 03:15:39.189]  So-called trendy modern liberals are not liberals.
[03:15:39.289 --> 03:15:45.331]  I don't want to put that name of liberal on them because there are some real liberals out there that are pretty good people.
[03:15:45.371 --> 03:15:48.032]  I may disagree with them on a few issues, but they're good people.
[03:15:48.672 --> 03:15:50.053]  There's not many of those anymore though.
[03:15:51.667 --> 03:16:01.732]  And they have really organized a group of criminals at every level of society to take over and force delusion on us and then just do horrible things.
[03:16:03.593 --> 03:16:04.854]  Really despicable things.
[03:16:08.896 --> 03:16:17.500]  I mean, it takes Bill Clinton a lot of will and nerve to show up in Haiti for an hour off of a helicopter, shake a bunch of people's hands with Chelsea,
[03:16:18.493 --> 03:16:20.094]  Gotta put that article back up on screen.
[03:16:20.574 --> 03:16:24.857]  But Chelsea actually looks, I'm not trying to lionize Chelsea, but she actually looks concerned and upset.
[03:16:25.557 --> 03:16:26.938]  Bill's all, oh, hi, how you doing?
[03:16:26.978 --> 03:16:27.618]  Shaking people's hands.
[03:16:28.019 --> 03:16:31.641]  Leaves, steals billions of dollars, gives basically nothing back.
[03:16:32.962 --> 03:16:34.883]  And then feels like a good guy.
[03:16:34.923 --> 03:16:41.086]  I mean, I would not be able to get out of bed in the morning if I had stolen money from children.
[03:16:42.947 --> 03:16:44.348]  And again, Bill Clinton would call me weak.
[03:16:44.428 --> 03:16:45.309]  Hillary would call me weak.
[03:16:47.970 --> 03:16:48.710]  No, I'm alive.
[03:16:48.790 --> 03:16:50.111]  You people are dead inside.
[03:16:51.511 --> 03:16:55.213]  And, you know, I know they intimidate the FBI and different agencies.
[03:16:55.253 --> 03:16:58.114]  They hire a lot of crooks and stuff, so people are afraid to speak out.
[03:16:58.134 --> 03:16:59.134]  And if you do, you get killed.
[03:16:59.154 --> 03:16:59.615]  They come after you.
[03:16:59.815 --> 03:17:01.035]  They can't stop us all.
[03:17:02.456 --> 03:17:04.817]  And folks in media, it's the same thing.
[03:17:05.597 --> 03:17:08.758]  People get fired out of the media for telling the truth, like the CBS reporter did.
[03:17:08.778 --> 03:17:10.079]  She went and started her own media operation.
[03:17:10.099 --> 03:17:10.839]  She's more successful.
[03:17:12.219 --> 03:17:12.760]  Forget her name.
[03:17:12.780 --> 03:17:13.540]  Don't have a teleprompter.
[03:17:15.691 --> 03:17:18.493]  I mean, you just gotta do the right thing and just say, whatever happens, happens.
[03:17:18.873 --> 03:17:19.694]  I'm doing the right thing.
[03:17:20.214 --> 03:17:25.818]  And then you build a good world, when almost everybody lies down and acts like a bunch of cowards.
[03:17:30.856 --> 03:17:35.918]  It really is a frightening prospect of the future, because evil takes over.
[03:17:36.198 --> 03:17:38.779]  You're not safe laying down to evil, you're in danger.
[03:17:39.499 --> 03:17:45.981]  And, you know, I see these controversies, people not wanting to stand up during the national anthem, and, hey, I'm all into free speech, if you don't want to do that, that's your issue.
[03:17:46.321 --> 03:17:57.345]  But then they go forward to bash America and say it's the worst, and bitch and gripe on top of it, and say how great George Soros is and Obama is, when they're big war-mongering criminals launching all these wars.
[03:17:58.772 --> 03:18:02.094]  Now the corporate media makes it popular to bash America.
[03:18:02.395 --> 03:18:08.899]  They either want empty, fake patriotism, or they want this big, fake, empty, attack patriotism, but to support globalism.
[03:18:11.121 --> 03:18:23.469]  And quite frankly, when I was a teenager, I was studying fascism and things, and I didn't particularly like getting up to do the Pledge of Allegiance in school, because I realized it was an autocratic control system.
[03:18:23.750 --> 03:18:26.772]  Not that I didn't want to pledge allegiance to the Republic, but that I got that
[03:18:27.711 --> 03:18:38.458]  This government was in America already by that point that somebody captured the country and so I was really saluting them, not the Republic.
[03:18:39.858 --> 03:18:42.480]  And I live here so I should be saluting them.
[03:18:42.720 --> 03:18:45.382]  Or I shouldn't be so everybody can know I'm not part of this.
[03:18:47.222 --> 03:19:11.816]  And see, America's got a horrible past, and done a lot of bad things, but compared to other countries, from every other historical perspective, the Japanese, French, you name it, we were special and amazing, and had amazing innovations, because we were about the little people being important, and the little people having ideas, the little people being able to compete, so the poorest person could end up, you know, be the head of the Navy, or the top inventor, or an artist.
[03:19:13.789 --> 03:19:21.976]  And so it was that idea of what you stood for and what you did, not where you came from or what you look like, that Martin Luther King continued with.
[03:19:21.996 --> 03:19:23.337]  That's Americana, folks!
[03:19:26.620 --> 03:19:30.263]  And now you see the complete opposite of that.
[03:19:32.025 --> 03:19:38.170]  It's cultic, it's stupid, it's gangster-ish, it's tribal, it's mindless, it's bad news.
[03:19:40.293 --> 03:19:43.255]  And so, I remember also growing up and hearing how great Texas was.
[03:19:43.275 --> 03:19:44.396]  I'm going to skip this break, guys.
[03:19:45.517 --> 03:19:50.121]  How great Texas was and how we were the best and all this.
[03:19:50.161 --> 03:19:54.204]  And I would just roll my eyes and just think, my God, because you always do that to parents and grandparents.
[03:19:54.664 --> 03:19:56.425]  Please quit talking about this and that.
[03:19:56.485 --> 03:19:57.326]  Please stop.
[03:19:57.967 --> 03:20:06.433]  Then as I got older and I traveled the country and the world, and Texas isn't perfect, but real old Texas was just the end of chivalry.
[03:20:07.454 --> 03:20:09.335]  It was kind of the last frontier.
[03:20:10.484 --> 03:20:11.605]  Of men still being men.
[03:20:11.885 --> 03:20:13.146]  Or just that idea.
[03:20:15.127 --> 03:20:16.949]  Like an Americana holdout.
[03:20:17.049 --> 03:20:18.029]  And then I understood.
[03:20:25.034 --> 03:20:27.656]  It's not that America is that good or Texas is that good.
[03:20:28.817 --> 03:20:30.278]  It's that everything else is so much worse.
[03:20:32.400 --> 03:20:34.061]  And we've turned our back on all of it.
[03:20:37.281 --> 03:20:39.002]  And they say you judge a tree by its fruits.
[03:20:39.902 --> 03:20:43.184]  Look at how many people fighting the New World Order come from Texas.
[03:20:44.404 --> 03:20:46.825]  Because of those ideals and believing in something.
[03:20:47.406 --> 03:20:49.027]  You can all say, yeah, look at George Bush coming from it.
[03:20:49.407 --> 03:20:52.668]  No, that's people coming from Kennebuckport, Maine.
[03:20:53.048 --> 03:20:54.609]  And I'm not bashing folks up in Maine.
[03:20:56.250 --> 03:20:56.850]  Or Connecticut.
[03:20:56.870 --> 03:21:04.754]  The point is, those are the bluebloods that infest that area coming down here to rob us and then take on the mantle of Texas when they're the opposite of it.
[03:21:06.129 --> 03:21:08.211]  A hat and cowboy boots does not make you a Texan.
[03:21:09.652 --> 03:21:12.314]  And I don't want to even sit there and lionize America or Texas.
[03:21:12.394 --> 03:21:12.814]  It's just that...
[03:21:13.720 --> 03:21:25.271]  When people are pissing on the flag and pissing on the Star Spangled Banner and the Pledge of Allegiance, they're pissing on what gave them hundred million dollar contracts and jets and mansions and everything.
[03:21:25.511 --> 03:21:37.322]  Not that that's the best thing in the world, it's just that the byproduct of a little bit of freedom is fabulous wealth, medicine, culture, opportunities, ideas, and to watch a bunch of spoiled rotten brats
[03:21:37.822 --> 03:21:54.202]  Run around with political correctness and talk about everything that's good as if it's the worst thing in the world makes me really want to involve myself in an Atlas Shrug type operation and just start pulling back and not caring.
[03:21:54.222 --> 03:21:55.503]  But that's what the elite did.
[03:21:56.491 --> 03:22:04.393]  They have that attitude, the public is a bunch of scum, and then they end up just going ahead and treating them like scum, and so then it makes them act like scum, and it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[03:22:04.833 --> 03:22:09.213]  I will not lower myself to the level of the elite or the general public.
[03:22:09.374 --> 03:22:10.494]  I will not be part of it.
[03:22:12.314 --> 03:22:16.095]  And it's not because I'm some perfect person, it's because I can't do it.
[03:22:17.215 --> 03:22:22.016]  When I even start thinking like the establishment thinks, I get a chill up my spine.
[03:22:24.741 --> 03:22:33.208]  Because that's turning myself over to this spirit that I'm not going to be part of.
[03:22:33.228 --> 03:22:38.532]  And no matter how many concerns I've got or no matter what the danger is, my soul is in charge.
[03:22:38.632 --> 03:22:42.175]  And it says, you are not going to join this ever.
[03:22:44.417 --> 03:22:45.518]  And it's that simple decision.
[03:22:45.918 --> 03:22:46.798]  Where does your soul lie?
[03:22:47.179 --> 03:22:50.681]  You don't have to go to some church with some jackass devil worshipping preacher.
[03:22:51.041 --> 03:22:53.002]  Half those sons of bitches are devil worshippers.
[03:22:53.582 --> 03:22:56.124]  You don't need to go to these big whore churches to find God.
[03:22:56.164 --> 03:22:57.164]  That's where you find the devil.
[03:22:57.585 --> 03:22:59.726]  You've got to make a decision in your heart who you stand for.
[03:23:01.854 --> 03:23:06.015]  Those Pharisees will tell you you're bad if you drink a beer, you think God's creation of woman's beautiful.
[03:23:06.255 --> 03:23:07.575]  And Lord knows that can get out of hand.
[03:23:08.095 --> 03:23:13.156]  But the point is, they want to make you feel guilty, so you think you've got to go through them to find God.
[03:23:13.376 --> 03:23:15.417]  They're there to make sure you don't find God!
[03:23:17.137 --> 03:23:20.378]  Let me tell you something, in my 40-something years, I've found God and I've found the devil.
[03:23:20.758 --> 03:23:21.958]  And I'm going with God all the way.
[03:23:22.258 --> 03:23:23.499]  Here's a special report on Haiti.
[03:23:23.679 --> 03:23:24.179]  We'll go to break.
[03:23:24.199 --> 03:23:25.139]  Come back with Anthony Guicciardi.
[03:23:30.040 --> 03:23:33.621]  If you love black people, why are you destroying Haiti?
[03:23:33.942 --> 03:23:42.365]  Why did you, Mr. Clinton, stop them from the rice that they were producing in Haiti to feed themselves?
[03:23:43.810 --> 03:23:53.035]  In this environment, the most important thing all of us can do is give even small amounts of cash for food, medicine, water, and shelter.
[03:23:53.395 --> 03:23:56.377]  You've got, like, the head of the Senate saying that the Clintons tried to bribe him.
[03:23:56.417 --> 03:24:01.600]  You've got local leaders saying how the Clintons do nothing, how they just collect all the money.
[03:24:01.620 --> 03:24:04.461]  And it just brings home, these people are damn evil.
[03:24:13.357 --> 03:24:15.260]  Young boy here with severe injury.
[03:24:15.300 --> 03:24:16.521]  We're his only way out of here.
[03:24:16.742 --> 03:24:19.185]  We're about to put him on our plane.
[03:24:19.385 --> 03:24:19.765]  The U.N.
[03:24:19.805 --> 03:24:22.749]  helicopter taking off is empty because they don't do evac.
[03:24:22.789 --> 03:24:25.453]  This is what's so frustrating here.
[03:24:25.473 --> 03:24:26.314]  No government help.
[03:24:26.354 --> 03:24:31.100]  They will bring in some food, but they won't do anything interesting, like help an individual.
[03:24:32.717 --> 03:24:33.578]  We're getting out of here.
[03:24:34.078 --> 03:24:37.800]  An old man on the stretcher with a spinal cord injury.
[03:24:38.881 --> 03:24:40.361]  America needs to know what's going on here.
[03:24:40.401 --> 03:24:42.863]  This is an absolute disaster.
[03:24:43.003 --> 03:24:45.304]  Obama sent in six or seven helicopters.
[03:24:45.324 --> 03:24:46.665]  They're all going home in a few days.
[03:24:47.806 --> 03:24:48.726]  People are starving.
[03:24:48.766 --> 03:24:49.747]  They don't have no water.
[03:24:50.327 --> 03:24:56.011]  This person was injured in a hurricane, which was seven or eight days ago, and we're just now getting him to a hospital.
[03:24:56.031 --> 03:25:06.099]  So anybody who cares about this, cares about the Haitian people, you need to call your congressman, you need to call your media, because this is a completely ignored story.
[03:25:06.119 --> 03:25:12.423]  A million people on this peninsula in western Haiti without water, without food, without medical care.
[03:25:14.865 --> 03:25:21.013]  Very, very little is being done by the international community and by the American government.
[03:25:21.593 --> 03:25:26.439]  And so, I saw only four stories in the entire media yesterday on the Haitian program.
[03:25:26.459 --> 03:25:28.341]  There's a million people in distress.
[03:25:28.762 --> 03:25:29.543]  This is important.
[03:25:29.863 --> 03:25:31.985]  You've got the Clinton Foundation here, but guess where they're at?
[03:25:32.266 --> 03:25:32.866]  In Port-au-Prince.
[03:25:33.547 --> 03:25:37.550]  Willing and dealing at the Marriott, you know, trying to put money in their own pockets.
[03:25:37.610 --> 03:25:44.835]  Meanwhile, you got people here with their legs snapped, fractured backs, trying to get help, trying to get out of here, trying to seek the medical attention they deserve and they should have.
[03:25:45.416 --> 03:25:50.639]  And these people are more concerned with putting money in their own pockets and benefiting their lives and their families later on down the road.
[03:25:50.659 --> 03:25:55.603]  When you have people here... Let me say, this guy's an EMT and he's been doing this for quite a while.
[03:25:55.803 --> 03:25:59.426]  How much Clinton Fund money have you seen actually put into the hands of Haitians?
[03:26:00.106 --> 03:26:01.167]  Absolutely nothing right now.
[03:26:01.187 --> 03:26:03.029]  Because we've been here since what?
[03:26:03.530 --> 03:26:04.191]  Last Wednesday?
[03:26:04.411 --> 03:26:04.571]  Yep.
[03:26:04.911 --> 03:26:05.872]  We haven't seen nothing yet.
[03:26:06.633 --> 03:26:08.936]  Most of the Haitians consider Hillary Clinton a thief.
[03:26:09.096 --> 03:26:11.198]  Would that be an accurate description?
[03:26:11.539 --> 03:26:12.239]  I would say yes.
[03:26:12.560 --> 03:26:12.720]  Yeah.
[03:26:13.020 --> 03:26:17.285]  Because that's what they, I mean that's, it's been going on for quite a while.
[03:26:17.705 --> 03:26:18.346]  So January 2010?
[03:26:18.386 --> 03:26:18.606]  Yep.
[03:26:18.626 --> 03:26:19.127]  Yeah.
[03:26:20.128 --> 03:26:20.749]  And before that?
[03:26:21.650 --> 03:26:22.751]  So, this is it.
[03:26:23.111 --> 03:26:25.792]  They're already digging their fingers in Haiti before it happened.
[03:26:25.812 --> 03:26:34.376]  And then when that catastrophic event took place, they seized it, jumped in here, and then took a hold of that natural disaster and then used it as a way to benefit themselves.
[03:26:34.396 --> 03:26:35.437]  And that's what they always do.
[03:26:36.057 --> 03:26:46.062]  And we have absolute proof that the Clintons have put nothing into Haiti other than getting a gold mine for Hillary's brother and their rich friends.
[03:26:46.582 --> 03:26:48.484]  I don't see major organizations down here.
[03:26:48.524 --> 03:26:50.726]  I don't see major organizations out in that area.
[03:26:50.766 --> 03:26:51.967]  We're the only ones out there.
[03:26:52.287 --> 03:26:55.810]  Hero is literally the only one out there in Danbury doing this work.
[03:26:55.870 --> 03:27:01.855]  And Danbury is one of the most affected areas where the hurricane went through and devastated the entire town.
[03:27:02.175 --> 03:27:04.898]  So we have a bunch of people without homes, without food, without shelter.
[03:27:05.658 --> 03:27:07.280]  And in need of medical assistance.
[03:27:07.380 --> 03:27:15.568]  So that in itself should be screaming out to the world that yes, we need eyes back on Haiti because we can't do it alone.
[03:27:15.648 --> 03:27:17.169]  We desperately need help.
[03:27:17.629 --> 03:27:25.297]  You know, what's amazing aside from some small scale US military aid and some other
[03:27:26.610 --> 03:27:27.151]  I don't know.
[03:27:41.830 --> 03:27:47.695]  You know, if these Asian people are lucky, they got 10 cents on the dollar out of that.
[03:27:47.835 --> 03:27:50.937]  And I think the large part of it is really the blame on the media.
[03:27:50.957 --> 03:27:53.079]  The media hasn't covered the story.
[03:27:53.099 --> 03:27:54.740]  I mean, this country's devastated.
[03:27:55.161 --> 03:27:59.023]  Haiti Air Ambulance, a great organization with a beautiful helicopter.
[03:28:00.324 --> 03:28:09.108]  Ambulance staff wants to come here and take our patients, but they can't go round trip on one tank of gas, okay?
[03:28:09.168 --> 03:28:12.549]  The only people they can get gas from out here is Munista, Munista.
[03:28:13.130 --> 03:28:16.751]  And they won't sell them gas, because they need it for their operation.
[03:28:18.532 --> 03:28:20.713]  They won't let us do medevacs on the UN planes.
[03:28:21.173 --> 03:28:25.695]  They won't let us do medevacs on the Army planes.
[03:28:26.483 --> 03:28:28.704]  The Army won't let you do medevac, right?
[03:28:28.804 --> 03:28:29.725]  The Army won't let us.
[03:28:29.745 --> 03:28:31.606]  They won't come here and take our people.
[03:28:31.666 --> 03:28:37.749]  Tell us what the Clinton Foundation has done for you.
[03:28:37.769 --> 03:28:38.669]  Where's the Clinton Foundation?
[03:28:38.689 --> 03:28:39.530]  Where's everybody?
[03:28:39.550 --> 03:28:43.051]  Gary and Diana have been down here with their own caravans.
[03:28:43.131 --> 03:28:45.232]  They came down with three planes.
[03:28:45.433 --> 03:28:50.295]  And we've been providing help to Danbury, Lekai, and Jeremy.
[03:28:51.229 --> 03:29:04.896]  They have been the only ones able to distribute to about 3,000 people, basically food, water, oil, the basic needs for any human being.
[03:29:05.456 --> 03:29:06.737]  We don't see the Red Cross.
[03:29:07.557 --> 03:29:11.359]  We haven't seen the Clinton Foundation doing anything in Haiti.
[03:29:12.495 --> 03:29:23.642]  We are the only ones medevacking those trauma people and Dan Marie, we're the only flights landing there, getting people out that need to be medevacked.
[03:29:23.682 --> 03:29:29.826]  My friends, we're gonna upload this video, there's a few more minutes left to it, the next hour at InfoWars.com.

[03:29:58.206 --> 03:29:59.087]  We're on the march.
[03:29:59.587 --> 03:30:01.188]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.109 --> 03:30:04.791]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.393 --> 03:30:20.040]  There's an article up on our website on Infowars.com written by Clifford Cunningham that addresses one anonymous Navy official telling Alaskans prepare for war.
[03:30:20.280 --> 03:30:24.362]  This official suggests that Russia is preparing an invasion in response to U.S.
[03:30:24.423 --> 03:30:24.823]  strikes.
[03:30:24.963 --> 03:30:30.987]  He's unnamed but he's warned the residents of Alaska to prepare for an invasion in the event of war between the U.S.
[03:30:31.007 --> 03:30:31.067]  and
[03:30:31.067 --> 03:30:31.387]  I think?
[03:30:54.019 --> 03:31:03.569]  He goes on to say our feeling in the Navy was that Obama has turned Alaska into a defenseless area that will serve as a forward base of operations when World War III begins.
[03:31:03.789 --> 03:31:05.852]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[03:31:08.857 --> 03:31:13.261]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[03:31:13.341 --> 03:31:24.291]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[03:31:24.451 --> 03:31:29.374]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[03:31:29.474 --> 03:31:31.995]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[03:31:32.055 --> 03:31:33.556]  It helps detoxify.
[03:31:33.776 --> 03:31:36.598]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[03:31:36.658 --> 03:31:41.401]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[03:31:41.421 --> 03:31:47.664]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[03:31:47.704 --> 03:31:53.007]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[03:31:53.027 --> 03:31:53.788]  I'm taking it now.
[03:31:54.028 --> 03:31:54.528]  Every day.
[03:31:54.728 --> 03:31:55.449]  This is so key.
[03:31:55.709 --> 03:31:58.030]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[03:31:58.270 --> 03:32:00.011]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[03:32:00.031 --> 03:32:02.131]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[03:32:02.251 --> 03:32:05.713]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:32:09.178 --> 03:32:14.261]  With the election just around the corner, I have to ask, have you gotten your Hillary for Prison t-shirt yet?
[03:32:14.781 --> 03:32:18.083]  After the election, this t-shirt will no longer be available.
[03:32:18.303 --> 03:32:23.966]  We only have a finite number of these, so be sure to get to Infowarsstore.com and get yours today.
[03:32:24.487 --> 03:32:28.389]  Even Hillary Clinton supporters like the Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[03:32:28.589 --> 03:32:30.010]  I'm voting for Hillary.
[03:32:30.290 --> 03:32:34.632]  This is a meme that is still viral worldwide, Hillary for Prison.
[03:32:34.932 --> 03:32:40.635]  Folks, we want to see Hillary Clinton put in prison, and we also want to see InfoWars go to the next level.
[03:32:40.935 --> 03:32:42.136]  Help us accomplish both.
[03:32:42.336 --> 03:32:54.823]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today, get your Hillary for Prison t-shirt, fund us in the InfoWar, start a political discourse with your neighbor, give a gift to a friend, get your piece of history today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:33:20.427 --> 03:33:22.149]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:22.990 --> 03:33:32.164]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:35.034 --> 03:33:58.781]  You know, when you watch a video like that, the Haiti video, and you think about what you're really looking at, you're looking at a group of people that have been completely deceived by charities, so-called charities, so-called help aid groups, that took money and then not only did nothing with it, but chose to use the money for something else as people are actually suffering and dying.
[03:33:59.221 --> 03:34:06.515]  There's people dying on camera, I spoke to Michael Zimmerman who shot all of that, and it's disturbing.
[03:34:06.535 --> 03:34:10.884]  And you think about that, you think, how could we get to a point where
[03:34:12.825 --> 03:34:14.327]  They're the only ones going down there.
[03:34:14.948 --> 03:34:16.991]  They're the only ones shipping down the food.
[03:34:17.011 --> 03:34:24.140]  There's some relief groups and everything helping them, but Gary is the only one out of billions of people in the world.
[03:34:25.061 --> 03:34:30.809]  He also has the resources, but going down there and helping those people, and you think about it, how do we get to that point?
[03:34:31.269 --> 03:34:41.174]  How do we get to the point globally, with everything that's happening, how do we possibly get to this level where you look at it and you say, what is going on?
[03:34:41.454 --> 03:34:42.294]  How is this possible?
[03:34:42.895 --> 03:34:45.776]  And also you think about, how did we get where we are as a country?
[03:34:45.796 --> 03:34:46.936]  You think over and over and over again.
[03:34:47.077 --> 03:34:55.260]  That's why they say, of course, that there's the election syndrome, the election anxiety syndrome, that people are having panic attacks because the election is so crazy.
[03:34:56.721 --> 03:34:59.203]  Everything is getting more and more out in the open.
[03:34:59.744 --> 03:34:59.884]  Right?
[03:34:59.904 --> 03:35:00.885]  You have an article like this.
[03:35:01.265 --> 03:35:04.047]  UK admits it spied illegally for 17 years.
[03:35:04.708 --> 03:35:06.809]  It's sorry, but it won't stop.
[03:35:07.550 --> 03:35:10.152]  Sorry we spied on you for 17 years, but we're not going to do anything about it.
[03:35:10.512 --> 03:35:10.693]  Right?
[03:35:11.233 --> 03:35:14.256]  So much of it is all just in the open now.
[03:35:14.556 --> 03:35:19.019]  And one of those things is about the hormone-disrupting chemicals.
[03:35:19.039 --> 03:35:21.522]  We're going to talk to Dr. Group about this news piece here in a moment.
[03:35:21.862 --> 03:35:25.405]  But years and years and years ago, five, six, seven years ago,
[03:35:27.148 --> 03:35:30.050]  We were always talking about hormone-disrupting chemicals.
[03:35:30.070 --> 03:35:31.011]  Alex was talking about it.
[03:35:31.031 --> 03:35:32.192]  I would write articles about it.
[03:35:33.013 --> 03:35:43.221]  I challenged Susan G. Komen for the Cure, the massive anti-breast cancer charity, to actually list avoiding BPA as one of the ways to prevent breast cancer.
[03:35:43.261 --> 03:35:45.523]  Back then it was like 130 studies showing it, right?
[03:35:46.064 --> 03:35:46.344]  Now, oh!
[03:35:47.785 --> 03:35:49.286]  But you're crazy then, by the way.
[03:35:49.326 --> 03:35:51.547]  You're totally insane, and it's not scientific.
[03:35:51.627 --> 03:35:52.447]  It's unfounded.
[03:35:52.788 --> 03:35:53.428]  You're crazy.
[03:35:54.308 --> 03:35:55.029]  It's not an issue.
[03:35:55.389 --> 03:36:05.874]  But, of course, yesterday an article comes out that hormone-disrupting chemicals are responsible for at least $340 billion in health-related costs.
[03:36:06.274 --> 03:36:12.898]  It's just killing people, and it's costing $340 billion in health-related costs because people are eating the junk.
[03:36:13.338 --> 03:36:14.599]  They're getting it in water bottles.
[03:36:15.299 --> 03:36:16.861]  We're going to talk about that with Dr. Group.
[03:36:17.221 --> 03:36:23.528]  So, what is happening where our brains are almost like short-circuiting because there's so much going on?
[03:36:23.588 --> 03:36:24.949]  That's what's happening.
[03:36:25.370 --> 03:36:26.231]  It's all out.
[03:36:26.872 --> 03:36:29.234]  We are aware the establishment system screwed us.
[03:36:29.294 --> 03:36:30.155]  We are sold a lie.
[03:36:30.515 --> 03:36:31.497]  People are pissed off.
[03:36:32.598 --> 03:36:55.077]  The establishment system, meanwhile, instead of even pretending that everything is fine, like, there's a little bit of that with the media, like, there's a small percentage of people that, you know, still trust the mega media to the point where they just think, you're right, everything's fine, like, everyone has their best interests at heart, there's no way anything could be going on, but what is actually happening is the information overload of our brains, we can't even digest it.
[03:36:55.902 --> 03:36:57.202]  We can't digest it.
[03:36:57.382 --> 03:36:59.003]  There's tons of articles talking about this.
[03:36:59.303 --> 03:37:10.526]  Neuroscientists say multitasking literally drains the energy reserves of your brain, and that is in terms of using a smartphone, reading the news, doing all the things that we're doing.
[03:37:10.546 --> 03:37:15.647]  We're going to go through some of this, but psychology today, flooding your brain's engine, how you can have too much of a good thing.
[03:37:16.067 --> 03:37:18.248]  Multitasking damages your brain and career.
[03:37:18.268 --> 03:37:20.769]  How technology is warping your memory.
[03:37:20.789 --> 03:37:21.909]  Basically what's happening
[03:37:22.810 --> 03:37:24.531]  And I do want to get Dr. Group's take on this, too.
[03:37:24.551 --> 03:37:26.072]  He's been patiently waiting.
[03:37:26.552 --> 03:37:27.913]  We're flooded with all this.
[03:37:27.933 --> 03:37:32.975]  Do you even remember what the big scandal was six months ago, or two months ago, or maybe even just a month ago?
[03:37:32.995 --> 03:37:33.796]  Do you even remember?
[03:37:33.816 --> 03:37:42.640]  Do you even remember the massive banking institutions that have been paying millions and millions of dollars of fines for money laundering with drug cartels?
[03:37:42.941 --> 03:37:50.264]  I mean, do we even remember the fact that we're paying over $183 billion a year in taxpayer money to the banks due to the bailouts?
[03:37:51.485 --> 03:37:54.187]  How much of this is actually actively on your mind?
[03:37:54.708 --> 03:38:01.033]  Probably zero, probably none of it, because we're just constantly just hit with all this junk every single day.
[03:38:01.273 --> 03:38:06.257]  We can't computate it all in our brains and then we forget about it and it just continues.
[03:38:06.518 --> 03:38:16.045]  Just like we're not going to do anything about the fact that Haiti is crushed and all the groups that claim that we're going to help them that received millions of dollars of funding and did nothing about it.
[03:38:16.906 --> 03:38:24.133]  Instead, Gary Haven and Infowars have to fly down on a private jet and unload millions of dollars of food.
[03:38:24.153 --> 03:38:38.586]  Alright, Dr. Group, I want to get your thoughts on this, and also talk about this proof that hormone-disrupting chemicals, we've been saying this for like 10 years, are actually killing people and costing $340 billion a year, but back then it was not a real thing.
[03:38:38.606 --> 03:38:41.429]  I mean, do you not see all this just so open now?
[03:38:41.449 --> 03:38:42.610]  It's just, it's overwhelming.
[03:38:43.803 --> 03:38:51.428]  Yeah, a lot of it I think has to do with everything that Alex has been talking about, everything that you've been posting online, everything that we've been posting online.
[03:38:51.868 --> 03:38:58.353]  The fact that people are waking up and realizing that the healthcare system is, you know, chaotic.
[03:38:58.853 --> 03:39:05.798]  They've seen their parents die, all the chemicals they're aware of now, they're becoming more aware of all this stuff.
[03:39:06.178 --> 03:39:07.058]  Just think about that.
[03:39:07.078 --> 03:39:07.339]  $340 billion.
[03:39:11.855 --> 03:39:12.255]  I think?
[03:39:31.994 --> 03:39:35.958]  Neurological and behavioral problems these things are causing.
[03:39:36.178 --> 03:39:43.985]  They're causing sterility in males, attention deficit disorder, autism, loss of... Yeah, if you just read this article, it's crazy.
[03:39:44.025 --> 03:39:44.845]  Listen to what it says.
[03:39:44.865 --> 03:39:55.054]  The so-called endocrine disrupting chemicals, so-called EDCs, are found in thousands of everyday products, ranging from plastic and metal food containers, detergents, flame retardants, toys and cosmetics, right?
[03:39:55.294 --> 03:39:56.676]  And then the next paragraph it says,
[03:39:57.276 --> 03:40:06.666]  Neurological damage, behavior problems, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, loss of IQ, accounted for at least four-fifths of these impacts.
[03:40:06.686 --> 03:40:14.094]  So, they say, as we've known this for years, yeah, it's in everything, just like you're saying, Dr. Group, it's in everything.
[03:40:14.634 --> 03:40:15.875]  It's in everyday products.
[03:40:15.935 --> 03:40:16.876]  It's in non-stick pans.
[03:40:16.936 --> 03:40:17.896]  It's in the dollar bill.
[03:40:17.937 --> 03:40:20.578]  It's in this printed out article right here.
[03:40:20.939 --> 03:40:22.800]  The BPA, the BPS, everything.
[03:40:22.860 --> 03:40:24.681]  It's all in all these consumer goods.
[03:40:25.142 --> 03:40:29.225]  And it's causing loss of IQ and autism and ADHD.
[03:40:29.245 --> 03:40:31.687]  That's okay though.
[03:40:31.767 --> 03:40:35.509]  But then we'll forget about it tomorrow and we'll say, what can we do about ADHD?
[03:40:36.090 --> 03:40:36.890]  What can we do?
[03:40:37.011 --> 03:40:39.072]  Well, it's, it's, there's nothing we can do.
[03:40:39.112 --> 03:40:40.033]  You know, how absurd is that?
[03:40:41.587 --> 03:40:56.083]  It's pretty absurd considering if you really look in, this study by the way was done by the Lancet, published by the Lancet, Diabetes and Endocrinology, but the biggest culprit, the biggest endocrine disrupting chemical in this study by far
[03:40:57.754 --> 03:40:58.214]  We're good to go.
[03:41:18.894 --> 03:41:21.876]  Halogens, which are bromine, fluoride, and chlorine.
[03:41:21.916 --> 03:41:26.898]  So it all goes back, if you look at the research, why in the world are these things allowed?
[03:41:26.998 --> 03:41:30.180]  Why are these chemicals allowed into our civilization?
[03:41:30.240 --> 03:41:33.642]  Not only do they destroy the human, but they also destroy the earth.
[03:41:34.062 --> 03:41:35.783]  But think about that!
[03:41:35.803 --> 03:41:43.627]  The most damaging element of the endocrine disrupting chemicals is the organobromine.
[03:41:43.968 --> 03:41:47.550]  And we know that bromine, chlorine, and fluoride fight for the receptor sites.
[03:41:47.570 --> 03:41:48.290]  There's iodine,
[03:41:49.093 --> 03:41:58.278]  Receptor sites on every single cell in the body, and we wonder why we have so many thyroid issues, ovarian cancer, prostate problems, breast.
[03:41:58.298 --> 03:41:59.458]  I mean, it doesn't matter.
[03:41:59.698 --> 03:42:09.083]  Any type of disease can be associated with these toxic compounds, and that's why it's so important to be on iodine every single day, is because how are you going to fight that?
[03:42:09.603 --> 03:42:15.246]  You know, you got to get rid of all your toys and clean up your diet and everything else, but you know, like you said earlier,
[03:42:16.340 --> 03:42:17.843]  Right now is a crazy time.
[03:42:17.903 --> 03:42:21.069]  I mean, not only in Haiti, but all around the world people are suffering.
[03:42:21.129 --> 03:42:25.036]  And you know, there was another article that came out by the Psychology Today.
[03:42:26.357 --> 03:42:35.121]  Which is talking about election stress disorder that 50% of the, and not just in America, but which is a real thing.
[03:42:35.821 --> 03:42:37.522]  It's a real condition.
[03:42:37.982 --> 03:42:38.943]  It's a new term, right?
[03:42:39.023 --> 03:42:42.885]  It's people that are so stressed out by the so-called election thing.
[03:42:43.065 --> 03:42:49.068]  Really, I think what they're stressed out about is the fact that they're seeing the truth of what their country is really like, right?
[03:42:49.168 --> 03:42:53.590]  They're seeing the truth of what the system so-called is actually doing.
[03:42:54.510 --> 03:43:01.457]  Because, if more than anything, I think the election has kind of pulled the veil back a little bit, right?
[03:43:01.557 --> 03:43:04.560]  It doesn't even mean that, like, one person is so great or whatever.
[03:43:04.580 --> 03:43:09.325]  It just means, wow, all this is actually going on because the gloves came off for the first time.
[03:43:09.765 --> 03:43:10.346]  But, uh, go ahead.
[03:43:11.946 --> 03:43:12.867]  No, that's true.
[03:43:13.187 --> 03:43:24.240]  You have, like, let's just say 50% of the people that are in fear right now that Hillary will win, and then you got 50% of the people out there that are in fear right now that Trump will win.
[03:43:24.300 --> 03:43:31.288]  So basically you've created a society of regardless who wins or who anybody's rooting for, it's 100% fear.
[03:43:33.150 --> 03:43:50.380]  And that's not the type of society that we want to live in and as a matter of fact it was pretty comical that the American Psychological Association actually published some stuff on how to cope with election stress and one of them is to limit media consumption
[03:43:51.158 --> 03:43:56.000]  And the other one is to stop having conflicting discussions about the election.
[03:43:56.020 --> 03:44:01.582]  The other one is, know that whatever happens, life will go on.
[03:44:01.722 --> 03:44:03.983]  Stop disagreeing with people.
[03:44:04.003 --> 03:44:05.784]  No more debate discussions.
[03:44:06.264 --> 03:44:07.204]  Yeah, that's crazy.
[03:44:07.244 --> 03:44:09.385]  And then the last one is, go vote.
[03:44:10.966 --> 03:44:15.288]  So in other words, it's kind of like many other things.
[03:44:15.448 --> 03:44:18.289]  It's not exactly the best way to prevent or cure anything.
[03:44:18.973 --> 03:44:22.355]  Yeah, it's just like nobody addresses the root cause of any problems.
[03:44:22.415 --> 03:44:25.557]  I mean, everybody is still addressing the symptoms of everything.
[03:44:26.677 --> 03:44:27.778]  Which is systemic.
[03:44:27.898 --> 03:44:29.979]  It's weird because as above, so below, right?
[03:44:30.039 --> 03:44:40.084]  If you look at the fact that no one addresses the root cause of things at a health level, at a cellular level, in terms of if you go in with something wrong with you, they don't say, well, what's your lifestyle like?
[03:44:40.104 --> 03:44:40.605]  What's your diet like?
[03:44:41.585 --> 03:44:46.172]  So is the political system, kind of like an organism, and we're not diagnosing it properly.
[03:44:46.192 --> 03:44:51.420]  We're just looking at all the little symptoms, like all the little latest scandals we're always freaking out about as a society.
[03:44:51.440 --> 03:44:53.744]  We're always looking at the littlest, tiniest things.
[03:44:54.104 --> 03:44:56.768]  It's almost like I've said before, we have a microscope.
[03:44:57.651 --> 03:44:59.312]  In front of our eyes, and that's all we could see.
[03:44:59.733 --> 03:45:06.838]  Or like a massive magnifying glass, we can only see one little thing, and it's dictated, or they at least tried to be dictated by the media.
[03:45:07.178 --> 03:45:10.020]  So we don't see the full, so-called holistic view, right?
[03:45:10.320 --> 03:45:13.022]  Because we can apply this over and over again to everything.
[03:45:13.543 --> 03:45:21.028]  Why are we not making a firm diagnosis on the state of society and the world, as opposed to hitting things with hammers, with gophers everywhere?
[03:45:21.068 --> 03:45:22.109]  It's never ever gonna work.
[03:45:23.310 --> 03:45:26.072]  Yeah, the Guardian just released a study that said
[03:45:26.889 --> 03:45:33.493]  They came out and said, we could prevent millions of cancer deaths with knowledge we already have.
[03:45:34.013 --> 03:45:34.513]  Hello?
[03:45:34.573 --> 03:45:37.475]  That's what we've been saying for the last 20 years.
[03:45:37.895 --> 03:45:44.139]  Cancer deaths right now, worldwide, are estimated to increase by over 50% between 2015 and 2030.
[03:45:45.279 --> 03:45:46.560]  It's rampant.
[03:45:46.840 --> 03:45:49.281]  Liver cancer, I've been talking about this for a long time.
[03:45:49.341 --> 03:45:50.942]  Heal the gut, heal the body.
[03:45:51.363 --> 03:45:52.863]  Clean the liver, clean the body.
[03:45:52.903 --> 03:45:54.504]  You get a new gut tissue every 24 hours.
[03:45:55.945 --> 03:45:57.908]  New liver every three months.
[03:45:57.948 --> 03:45:59.910]  The two fastest regenerating organs.
[03:46:00.011 --> 03:46:02.774]  Do you think that there was a reason that God did that?
[03:46:03.215 --> 03:46:06.739]  Because he knew that we were going to be processing so many chemicals and toxins?
[03:46:07.080 --> 03:46:11.786]  And now, liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death worldwide.
[03:46:11.906 --> 03:46:13.188]  Well, just look at this article, right?
[03:46:13.268 --> 03:46:17.553]  So, from The Guardian, we could prevent millions of cancer deaths with knowledge we already have.
[03:46:18.234 --> 03:46:20.898]  And, what's interesting, they don't even get into a lot of things in this.
[03:46:20.998 --> 03:46:24.563]  It's more just, you know, basic prevention and stuff in, like, third world countries and things.
[03:46:24.783 --> 03:46:29.189]  Oh, they say only 50% of the girls are getting the HPV vaccine.
[03:46:29.529 --> 03:46:29.789]  Right.
[03:46:29.809 --> 03:46:30.250]  Right.
[03:46:45.259 --> 03:46:48.822]  This is from the New Zealand Herald, because it just had a better title than the Reuters, it's the same thing.
[03:46:49.283 --> 03:46:54.928]  But, it says, this is New Zealand Herald, chemicals in everyday products link to cancer, autism, diabetes.
[03:46:54.968 --> 03:47:00.753]  It's talking about the endocrine disruptors and about how it costs $340 billion to deal with that, and it's killing people, right?
[03:47:01.053 --> 03:47:05.197]  So, look at that, and then look at something like this.
[03:47:05.277 --> 03:47:08.320]  The Guardian, we can prevent millions of cancer deaths with knowledge we already have, right?
[03:47:08.860 --> 03:47:11.882]  So, even the Guardian piece didn't even venture into that.
[03:47:12.042 --> 03:47:16.645]  It didn't even venture into the concept of what we're eating is killing us, what we're drinking is killing us.
[03:47:16.665 --> 03:47:20.608]  And I don't mean to sit here and say that everything we're doing, you're gonna die of cancer and it's horrible.
[03:47:20.968 --> 03:47:21.789]  No, it's not like that.
[03:47:22.089 --> 03:47:29.394]  It's simple systems that could be fixed at the root systemic level from the producers of all this, okay?
[03:47:29.834 --> 03:47:32.796]  InfoWarsLife doesn't have a bunch of stuff in it that's gonna kill you and give you cancer.
[03:47:32.816 --> 03:47:33.797]  It's simple.
[03:47:34.497 --> 03:47:37.659]  As a producer, as a manufacturer, you don't have to choose to do that.
[03:47:37.819 --> 03:47:38.680]  Just like this article,
[03:47:39.120 --> 03:47:57.404]  So, factory farming could lead us to, quote, antibiotic apocalypse, this is from the Canary, and it talks about what we already know, 70% of antibiotics are dumped into the livestock, it's used as a preventative now, so it's the animals aren't even sick, you just dump antibiotics into them in case they get sick, because you can't lose profits if the animal dies.
[03:47:57.864 --> 03:48:04.026]  And as long as it's sustained just enough, like even if it's on the brink of death, just enough to sell it, that's all that matters.
[03:48:05.646 --> 03:48:08.429]  It's not like a pipe dream or something.
[03:48:08.469 --> 03:48:11.672]  People always criticize and say, well, everything gives you cancer.
[03:48:11.712 --> 03:48:13.033]  You can't do anything about it.
[03:48:13.594 --> 03:48:16.656]  Well, number one, you can at an individual level, 100%.
[03:48:17.177 --> 03:48:21.961]  But number two, this platform can be utilized to actually change things as it has been.
[03:48:22.442 --> 03:48:25.465]  Numerous successes, numerous victories, activism victories.
[03:48:25.925 --> 03:48:31.491]  But it's at a systemic level when the producers decide to do something about it, just like the political organism.
[03:48:32.372 --> 03:48:36.397]  It's not like sitting here talking about this is doing nothing and going into the ether.
[03:48:36.577 --> 03:48:43.665]  It's actually affecting things globally and then the producers in the political climate, just as the health climate, are forced to actually do something about it.
[03:48:45.285 --> 03:48:51.708]  You know, I think that we're really blessed to be on the planet at this particular time.
[03:48:51.728 --> 03:48:56.811]  I mean, yes, we're dealing with a lot of stuff, but we're also dealing with radical change at the same time.
[03:48:57.292 --> 03:49:04.455]  And every single day that we come in and all of the people that are learning more and more and more about their health, it's we the people.
[03:49:04.515 --> 03:49:10.379]  I mean, you know, cleansing, for example, has been used in the ancient Egyptian times.
[03:49:10.459 --> 03:49:14.141]  I mean, ancient Roman times, they all used olive oil to cleanse the liver.
[03:49:14.221 --> 03:49:14.581]  That's why
[03:49:15.598 --> 03:49:17.119]  The truth never changes.
[03:49:17.199 --> 03:49:18.641]  It stands the test of time.
[03:49:18.821 --> 03:49:24.806]  And all civilizations had ways of cleansing the earth and cleansing the body.
[03:49:25.347 --> 03:49:34.975]  And now more and more people are starting to wake up to that fact and realize, see, we're manipulated from birth because we're taught that we have to look outside for everything else.
[03:49:35.055 --> 03:49:36.937]  We have to look outside for the answers.
[03:49:37.237 --> 03:49:39.139]  We have to go to a doctor to heal us.
[03:49:39.199 --> 03:49:41.001]  We have to go over here to do this.
[03:49:41.061 --> 03:49:42.342]  And we have to learn in the own
[03:49:42.802 --> 03:49:43.102]  We're good.
[03:49:58.655 --> 03:50:13.263]  You know, when you have that hope and you have that faith and you are not in a state of fear, not in a state of anxiety, not in a state of stress, and you know how to keep your body clean, you keep your gut healthy and you keep your liver clean, then there's nothing.
[03:50:13.303 --> 03:50:18.565]  That's what activates your body's self-healing mechanism and keeps you strong and keeps you powerful.
[03:50:19.166 --> 03:50:22.647]  You know, listen, the powers to be are very, very scared of one thing.
[03:50:23.328 --> 03:50:25.449]  That is, if people learn how to meditate.
[03:50:26.198 --> 03:50:36.330]  There have been many, many studies done, over 50 documented studies by, you can go to World Peace Group, and it's called the 1% Radiance Effect.
[03:50:36.891 --> 03:50:42.497]  And it's proven that if 1% of any given population, let's say there's 100,000 people in a city,
[03:50:44.660 --> 03:50:47.424]  And 1% of those people start meditating.
[03:50:48.025 --> 03:50:53.132]  It's been proven that you can literally change society with your thoughts and through meditation.
[03:50:53.232 --> 03:50:54.474]  Dr. Group, we've got to go to break.
[03:50:54.775 --> 03:50:55.636]  Thank you for coming on the show.
[03:50:55.656 --> 03:50:59.521]  I think you've got to go to a live stream event right after this, but we'll be right back with a lot more news.
[03:51:11.957 --> 03:51:16.901]  Now another shirt that was designed and licensed from Roger Stone is the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[03:51:17.582 --> 03:51:20.244]  Looks like the, you know, communist style Obama hope shirt.
[03:51:20.965 --> 03:51:26.930]  But says rape, wear it, get aggressive, start the conversations, get on TV with it.
[03:51:26.950 --> 03:51:28.011]  In fact, I'm going to say this right now.
[03:51:28.411 --> 03:51:37.639]  Anyone that gets on national TV with the shirt clearly for more than five seconds gets $1,000.
[03:51:40.219 --> 03:51:41.801]  That means, you know, behind cameras, you name it.
[03:51:41.981 --> 03:51:51.872]  Anyone that gets it on air on national TV and gets the words out, Bill Clinton is a rapist, are things along that line with a bullhorn.
[03:51:51.912 --> 03:51:52.913]  I could go to this right now. $5,000.
[03:51:56.883 --> 03:51:58.285]  Until a budget of $100,000 has been spent.
[03:52:12.703 --> 03:52:18.310]  I think one of the kind of the things that we really need to be looking at in this debate is that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:52:18.430 --> 03:52:19.391]  Infowars.com.
[03:52:19.491 --> 03:52:20.312]  Infowars.com.
[03:52:20.592 --> 03:52:21.473]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[03:52:21.794 --> 03:52:22.875]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:52:22.915 --> 03:52:23.175]  Alright.
[03:52:23.195 --> 03:52:24.217]  Bill Clinton.
[03:52:24.237 --> 03:52:30.944]  I got this Hillary for prison t-shirt and I just want everyone to know about this like big presidential campaign that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:52:31.065 --> 03:52:31.805]  Infowars.com.
[03:52:32.766 --> 03:52:36.108]  Okay, thank you very much, Terrence.
[03:52:36.188 --> 03:52:37.748]  He doesn't age.
[03:52:38.109 --> 03:52:39.349]  No, he doesn't.
[03:52:39.409 --> 03:52:40.810]  He looks great.
[03:52:41.130 --> 03:52:43.391]  We're all going to rickroll.
[03:52:44.371 --> 03:52:44.891]  Exactly.
[03:52:45.252 --> 03:52:50.014]  We've had a $100,000 contest before.
[03:52:50.054 --> 03:52:50.454]  My budget's $100,000.
[03:52:50.494 --> 03:52:54.336]  That means if a bunch of people do this, I'll pay up to $100,000 and stop them.
[03:53:03.986 --> 03:53:08.429]  That's $1,000 if you just get the shirt on national TV.
[03:53:10.170 --> 03:53:10.790]  Visually.
[03:53:11.031 --> 03:53:11.291]  Right.
[03:53:12.472 --> 03:53:12.692]  Okay?
[03:53:13.852 --> 03:53:15.914]  It is.
[03:53:16.814 --> 03:53:17.775]  It is.
[03:53:17.795 --> 03:53:18.956]  $5,000 if you get the audio.
[03:53:18.976 --> 03:53:19.656]  Legally and lawfully.
[03:53:19.676 --> 03:53:28.983]  They gotta be outdoors, mother to little bitch, you gotta have a bullhorn, you gotta have the shirt on or have somebody with it, or maybe a big sign with it on it and two of you hold it up and then somebody else bullhorns.
[03:53:29.403 --> 03:53:32.585]  Bill Clinton is a rapist, not a philanderer.
[03:53:33.146 --> 03:53:34.607]  Hillary covers up the rape.
[03:53:39.508 --> 03:53:42.190]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[03:53:42.390 --> 03:53:45.473]  That communist Chinese-style net censorship was coming to the web.
[03:53:45.793 --> 03:53:46.533]  Because it's already here.
[03:53:46.934 --> 03:53:47.594]  It's being announced.
[03:53:47.954 --> 03:53:51.417]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[03:53:51.817 --> 03:53:53.759]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:53:53.879 --> 03:53:55.440]  A new battleship in the fight.
[03:53:55.620 --> 03:53:56.641]  InfoWars Live.
[03:53:56.821 --> 03:53:57.642]  Available right now.
[03:53:57.922 --> 03:53:59.283]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[03:53:59.703 --> 03:54:02.105]  You gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[03:54:02.766 --> 03:54:03.726]  Or you gonna be part of history?
[03:54:04.267 --> 03:54:07.289]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[03:54:07.789 --> 03:54:08.350]  Take action!
[03:54:13.917 --> 03:54:15.842]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:54:16.323 --> 03:54:19.070]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:54:23.666 --> 03:54:30.928]  So I want to talk a little bit about Ecuador saying it cut off WikiLeaks internet, or rather, Julian Assange's internet through its own embassy.
[03:54:31.648 --> 03:54:37.870]  But first, also, I want to remind you at InfoWarsLife.com, I mean, today is the final debate.
[03:54:38.070 --> 03:54:42.011]  It is now time to fund groups you actually care about and you're interested in.
[03:54:42.591 --> 03:54:50.373]  Groups that are willing to do things like fly someone down to Haiti and document the entire thing and assist amazing people like Gary Haven
[03:54:51.093 --> 03:54:51.894]  I don't think so.
[03:55:13.377 --> 03:55:14.677]  And it's 25% off.
[03:55:15.138 --> 03:55:17.038]  So if you've tried it before, you want to stock up.
[03:55:17.138 --> 03:55:19.659]  If you've never tried it, now is the absolute time to do it.
[03:55:19.979 --> 03:55:27.081]  And once again, these are not formulas that just get cranked out, that are junk, that we just say, well, you know what?
[03:55:27.101 --> 03:55:28.121]  We can save some money.
[03:55:28.161 --> 03:55:28.821]  It doesn't matter.
[03:55:28.881 --> 03:55:35.703]  It's not like the chickens that the factory farms just dump full of antibiotics so they don't die, or at least don't die long enough.
[03:55:36.243 --> 03:55:39.864]  With their chronic conditions so they can be slaughtered up and eaten, right?
[03:55:39.904 --> 03:55:41.125]  This is the real deal stuff.
[03:55:41.225 --> 03:55:43.285]  It's actually curated and taken care of.
[03:55:43.686 --> 03:55:50.768]  So, BrainForce, 25% off today is the day to do it because the special will be down soon.
[03:55:50.948 --> 03:55:53.689]  So, InfoWarsLife.com, support things you actually believe in.
[03:55:53.709 --> 03:56:02.292]  Instead of buying just a Starbucks coffee in the morning, which is like $20 anyway, buy something that is going to help you in your life and support something that is doing good.
[03:56:02.752 --> 03:56:03.793]  Now, let's talk about this.
[03:56:04.733 --> 03:56:09.537]  The Guardian, Ecuador says it cut WikiLeaks founder's internet over interference in U.S.
[03:56:09.597 --> 03:56:09.997]  election.
[03:56:11.058 --> 03:56:17.042]  Now, you think about the damage control level that we see, it's pathetic, right?
[03:56:17.483 --> 03:56:19.364]  Not just in this particular instance, right?
[03:56:20.445 --> 03:56:21.906]  But the concept that, oh,
[03:56:23.643 --> 03:56:31.966]  They're interfering in the election, just like Russia's interfering in the election by releasing all the things that Hillary Clinton's doing.
[03:56:32.026 --> 03:56:41.629]  Or you could say like, oh well, activists online are interfering in the election by talking about Hillary Clinton's past.
[03:56:42.369 --> 03:56:42.589]  What?
[03:56:43.209 --> 03:56:44.570]  Interfering in the election?
[03:56:45.090 --> 03:56:47.571]  I thought we were trying to make more informed decisions.
[03:56:48.564 --> 03:56:48.764]  Right?
[03:56:48.784 --> 03:56:54.308]  I thought if you have more information, you can make a more informed decision about which candidate you want to support.
[03:56:54.328 --> 03:56:55.008]  No, no, no, no.
[03:56:55.709 --> 03:56:57.930]  That's interfering in the elections.
[03:56:58.591 --> 03:57:05.996]  You say, well, but it's just information about what they are doing and it's showing it to the public that they're supposed to elect their leader based on that kind of stuff.
[03:57:06.036 --> 03:57:06.716]  And no.
[03:57:07.557 --> 03:57:12.000]  So now it's interfering in the election at the lowest levels of anything you do.
[03:57:12.300 --> 03:57:15.142]  So talking about this article is interfering in the election.
[03:57:15.822 --> 03:57:17.904]  According to this weird nomenclature, right?
[03:57:18.364 --> 03:57:21.387]  So, I guess anything now could be interfering.
[03:57:21.927 --> 03:57:31.355]  So, you actually can't present information and news that's been presented to you, like Julian Assange gets this information about Hillary that he says, wow, this is really powerful stuff.
[03:57:31.776 --> 03:57:33.517]  We need to have the public aware of this.
[03:57:34.438 --> 03:57:35.539]  That's interfering in the election.
[03:57:35.579 --> 03:57:37.300]  So, it's no longer informing people.
[03:57:38.261 --> 03:57:40.883]  Cops have a database of 117 million faces.
[03:57:41.184 --> 03:57:42.225]  You're probably in it.
[03:57:43.117 --> 03:57:44.498]  This is from Wired.
[03:57:44.598 --> 03:57:59.912]  It's no secret that the American law has been building facial recognition databases to aid in its investigations, but a new comprehensive report on the status of facial recognition as a tool in law enforcement shows the sheer scope and reach of the FBI's database of faces and those of state-level law enforcement agencies.
[03:58:00.212 --> 03:58:06.898]  Roughly half of American adults are included in those collections, and that massive assembly of biometric data is accessible with spotty oversight.
[03:58:07.438 --> 03:58:09.760]  So, here's my question, too, on the whole police thing.
[03:58:10.888 --> 03:58:22.454]  Why are we so obsessed with local-level police actions that may or may not be bad, and no one cares anymore about the fact that there's millions, half of Americans' faces are in these databases with virtually no oversight.
[03:58:22.754 --> 03:58:24.675]  No one knows what's really being done with them.
[03:58:24.915 --> 03:58:29.357]  They're being shared with corporations and things, but people don't get mad about that.
[03:58:30.078 --> 03:58:30.238]  Right?
[03:58:30.718 --> 03:58:32.779]  We just have lost our focus in so many different ways.
[03:58:32.839 --> 03:58:37.902]  Not that other things that are happening aren't bad, but these are the kind of things that are now being glossed over.
[03:58:38.602 --> 03:58:47.411]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi and this broadcast is going to continue all night long with live debate coverage from Alex and everyone else at InfoWars, so stay tuned.
[03:58:49.414 --> 03:58:51.195]  You are listening to GCN.
[03:58:52.917 --> 03:58:55.100]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:59.369 --> 03:59:06.712]  Tonight, tune into Infowars.com forward slash show for live coverage of the big, epic last debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
[03:59:06.872 --> 03:59:08.673]  We're starting our pre-debate show at 3 p.m.
[03:59:08.713 --> 03:59:10.714]  Central, right after the main transmission.
[03:59:10.814 --> 03:59:13.856]  So if you're already watching the Alex Jones Show, just continue watching.
[03:59:14.056 --> 03:59:14.596]  At 7 p.m.
[03:59:14.636 --> 03:59:16.837]  Central, we'll go over what to watch for during the debate.
[03:59:17.137 --> 03:59:18.718]  And the debate starts at 8 p.m.
[03:59:18.758 --> 03:59:19.098]  Central.
[03:59:19.298 --> 03:59:26.644]  Now this debate is not just about Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton, but rather it's about how the shadow government is finally uncloaking before our very eyes to destroy U.S.
[03:59:26.684 --> 03:59:27.145]  sovereignty.
[03:59:27.205 --> 03:59:35.332]  The latest WikiLeaks emails reveal the inner workings of the global elite who are forging an authoritarian society dominated by technocrats in government, technology, and media.
[03:59:35.452 --> 03:59:36.752]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[04:00:27.066 --> 04:00:31.468]  It's 11.59 at Radio Free America, and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[04:00:32.068 --> 04:00:35.669]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[04:00:36.089 --> 04:00:37.670]  The chair is against the wall.
[04:00:38.150 --> 04:00:39.811]  The chair is against the wall.
[04:00:40.351 --> 04:00:42.072]  John has a long mustache.
[04:00:42.352 --> 04:00:43.992]  John has a long mustache.
[04:00:44.412 --> 04:00:47.113]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans, another day closer to victory.
[04:00:47.293 --> 04:00:51.395]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[04:00:57.273 --> 04:00:58.714]  But they took a lot of people away.
[04:00:59.155 --> 04:01:01.036]  People that they thought were gonna make trouble for them.
[04:01:01.276 --> 04:01:03.899]  People that had guns and things they wanted, they just took them away.
[04:01:04.499 --> 04:01:04.739]  Where?
[04:01:05.860 --> 04:01:07.722]  Re-education camps, that's what they call it.
[04:01:07.962 --> 04:01:12.325]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents.
[04:01:12.646 --> 04:01:15.908]  Or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[04:01:16.149 --> 04:01:20.072]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[04:01:21.806 --> 04:01:25.849]  And we need to take the chance that you all run.
[04:01:26.350 --> 04:01:27.171]  I mean, really.
[04:01:27.391 --> 04:01:30.313]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[04:01:30.774 --> 04:01:35.778]  Now they were taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[04:01:35.858 --> 04:01:37.980]  I'm a sorry citizen.
[04:01:38.000 --> 04:01:39.521]  I refuse to recognize you guys.
[04:01:39.861 --> 04:01:41.602]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[04:01:41.663 --> 04:01:42.783]  would you see that happening?
[04:01:42.803 --> 04:01:46.746]  We've got a lot of constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[04:01:47.347 --> 04:01:55.653]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[04:01:57.295 --> 04:02:03.139]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States.
[04:02:03.279 --> 04:02:07.863]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community.
[04:02:14.679 --> 04:02:16.942]  It's what we're doing here, and let's not kid about it.
[04:02:17.182 --> 04:02:21.988]  We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[04:02:22.248 --> 04:02:23.269]  Put your gun down, really?
[04:02:25.451 --> 04:02:29.857]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[04:02:30.417 --> 04:02:31.939]  It's Alex Jones.
[04:02:32.279 --> 04:02:34.282]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[04:02:36.946 --> 04:02:41.989]  So these people who call themselves out to be patriots are not.
[04:02:42.489 --> 04:02:44.770]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[04:02:45.251 --> 04:02:49.133]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[04:03:06.627 --> 04:03:10.929]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[04:03:11.149 --> 04:03:13.410]  Americanism, not globalism!
[04:03:13.570 --> 04:03:15.631]  Americanism, not globalism!
[04:03:18.212 --> 04:03:19.473]  All right, and we are live.
[04:03:19.493 --> 04:03:20.614]  It is now 3 p.m.
[04:03:20.694 --> 04:03:22.835]  Central here on October 19th.
[04:03:22.875 --> 04:03:28.997]  This is what we've all been waiting for, the third and final debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
[04:03:29.098 --> 04:03:33.960]  And if you've been watching our coverage, it's very unlike the mainstream media, which is focusing on Donald Trump.
[04:03:34.680 --> 04:03:43.531]  And the mean things he said to people in the past and not about the lies and the looting and the criminality that follows the Clinton clan everywhere it goes.
[04:03:43.551 --> 04:03:45.633]  That's Bill and Hillary.
[04:03:55.564 --> 04:04:03.347]  A person, an individual in the shadow government that I have a little bit of intimate knowledge with, dating back from 2010, this guy has been causing problems.
[04:04:03.668 --> 04:04:05.888]  But why did we just play that Red Dawn intro?
[04:04:06.269 --> 04:04:12.571]  Well, it goes back to this article right here from Infowars.com, this is by Clifford Cunningham, came out yesterday.
[04:04:13.051 --> 04:04:16.193]  Navy officer tells Alaskans to prepare for war.
[04:04:17.293 --> 04:04:23.758]  An unnamed former Navy official has warned residents of Alaska to prepare for an invasion in the event of war between the USA and Russia.
[04:04:23.778 --> 04:04:27.941]  He told the Daily Star this, but this is where it gets interesting.
[04:04:29.262 --> 04:04:32.564]  He talks about Russians being disguised as highway road crews.
[04:04:35.106 --> 04:04:37.487]  He talks about Alaskans preparing to serve as
[04:04:39.005 --> 04:04:41.546]  In an asymmetrical warfare style invasion.
[04:04:41.566 --> 04:04:43.027]  So they have people on the ground.
[04:04:43.047 --> 04:04:48.750]  They're claiming troops on the ground to disrupt communications, seize vital bridges when war begins.
[04:04:49.410 --> 04:04:58.494]  Another anonymous source claims that Russians are already there acting as road crews and they have started moving into abandoned motels and military bases.
[04:04:59.134 --> 04:05:04.977]  Okay, and this comes upon the heels of all the other warnings that we've had where the Russians are preparing to evacuate 40 million people.
[04:05:05.297 --> 04:05:07.078]  They've told their people to stock up on food.
[04:05:07.698 --> 04:05:11.280]  They've told their people to get ready for war and what are we talking about here?
[04:05:11.521 --> 04:05:13.622]  We're talking about some things Donald Trump might have said.
[04:05:13.642 --> 04:05:16.184]  And we're not talking about WikiLeaks.
[04:05:16.224 --> 04:05:22.968]  We can't talk about that because CNN said we can't talk about WikiLeaks because that's against the law to be in possession of those emails.
[04:05:23.268 --> 04:05:27.351]  We can't read what our stinking government's doing because they're afraid to put out the information.
[04:05:27.371 --> 04:05:31.533]  Now I want to remind you, we're doing 13 hours today from 11 a.m.
[04:05:31.853 --> 04:05:32.374]  to midnight.
[04:05:33.374 --> 04:05:33.595]  Okay?
[04:05:34.502 --> 04:05:36.484]  We have three specials going on right now.
[04:05:36.805 --> 04:05:38.547]  We have 25% off BrainForce.
[04:05:38.707 --> 04:05:39.868]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[04:05:39.888 --> 04:05:42.211]  BrainForce is one of the things that keeps me going throughout the day.
[04:05:42.231 --> 04:05:43.512]  25% off.
[04:05:43.693 --> 04:05:44.774]  Also, we have free shipping.
[04:05:45.174 --> 04:05:47.016]  We also have the Hillary for Prison t-shirts.
[04:05:47.617 --> 04:05:47.937]  Okay?
[04:05:48.078 --> 04:05:49.820]  They're at basically cost, $9.95.
[04:05:51.201 --> 04:05:53.203]  And Living Defense is back in stock.
[04:05:53.243 --> 04:05:53.864]  It is now back.
[04:05:53.884 --> 04:06:00.850]  That is another great product to basically eliminate toxic organisms from your body naturally without harmful chemicals.
[04:06:00.910 --> 04:06:01.911]  It's all natural herbs.
[04:06:02.231 --> 04:06:02.992]  That's what we're all about.
[04:06:03.012 --> 04:06:06.555]  We're not about stuff like an article I'm going to get into a little bit later.
[04:06:07.016 --> 04:06:11.480]  The hormone-disrupting chemicals in your plastic bottles that cause autism and cancer.
[04:06:11.880 --> 04:06:16.381]  That's right, they've been putting it in there for years and they've known it has these problems and they've still done it anyway.
[04:06:16.401 --> 04:06:23.063]  So we're going to talk about that and the things you need to do to put in your body to counteract these hormone disrupting chemicals.
[04:06:23.643 --> 04:06:27.605]  So going back to this Navy officer that is telling Alaskans to prepare for war.
[04:06:28.105 --> 04:06:32.166]  Have you heard anything from the mainstream media about war in our country?
[04:06:33.243 --> 04:06:33.663]  Not a thing.
[04:06:33.944 --> 04:06:39.148]  If you type in World War 3 and Russia into a search engine, in fact, you guys can do this right now.
[04:06:39.328 --> 04:06:42.531]  Type in World War 3, Russia, and then we'll show you the search engine results.
[04:06:43.532 --> 04:06:45.533]  You'll see no mainstream media links.
[04:06:46.374 --> 04:06:47.775]  And then you can even click on News.
[04:06:47.875 --> 04:06:48.636]  I did this the other day.
[04:06:48.956 --> 04:06:49.897]  And show the links there.
[04:06:50.237 --> 04:06:51.278]  No mainstream media links.
[04:06:52.819 --> 04:06:53.520]  Daily Star.
[04:06:55.737 --> 04:06:56.317]  Inquisitor.
[04:06:56.677 --> 04:06:57.918]  These are Zero Hedge.
[04:06:58.418 --> 04:07:00.658]  These are all alternative media.
[04:07:00.998 --> 04:07:01.419]  UK.
[04:07:01.819 --> 04:07:03.059]  So the UK is talking about it.
[04:07:03.199 --> 04:07:04.379]  Australia is talking about it.
[04:07:05.240 --> 04:07:05.620]  Everybody.
[04:07:05.640 --> 04:07:06.900]  Turkey is talking about it.
[04:07:07.500 --> 04:07:11.101]  But we can't talk about it here, just like we can't talk about election fraud.
[04:07:11.141 --> 04:07:13.942]  Just like Obama came out today and said, don't talk about election fraud.
[04:07:13.962 --> 04:07:16.443]  I'm sick and tired of hearing all this nonsense about election fraud.
[04:07:17.003 --> 04:07:18.143]  We're not allowed to talk about it.
[04:07:19.223 --> 04:07:23.305]  Even when we get them on tape saying that, yeah, we're committing election fraud.
[04:07:23.325 --> 04:07:24.225]  We've been doing it for 50 years.
[04:07:24.245 --> 04:07:25.005]  We're going to keep doing it.
[04:07:25.967 --> 04:07:27.508]  Not a peep from the mainstream media.
[04:07:27.528 --> 04:07:28.429]  And that ought to tell you something.
[04:07:28.449 --> 04:07:30.070]  That ought to tell you whose side they are on.
[04:07:30.390 --> 04:07:32.711]  They are on the corrupt establishment side.
[04:07:33.732 --> 04:07:38.195]  They want you to think they've got everything under control and if you just vote Hillary in office, everything's going to be fine.
[04:07:38.435 --> 04:07:42.738]  She's going to take care of you because she is your, she's your keeper.
[04:07:42.998 --> 04:07:47.120]  She's going to make sure you get your health care, your food stamps, your free housing.
[04:07:47.140 --> 04:07:49.762]  In fact, we're going to take everybody from all the other countries.
[04:07:49.802 --> 04:07:51.883]  Just come on in because Hillary's going to take care of you.
[04:07:51.903 --> 04:07:52.644]  She's your big mama.
[04:07:54.111 --> 04:07:59.816]  And they're not going to tell you to get up and you have to do things by yourself, pulling up your bootstraps, getting things done.
[04:08:00.677 --> 04:08:03.499]  They're not going to tell you that because they're afraid.
[04:08:03.539 --> 04:08:10.384]  They're afraid if you become educated and empowered, they will lose power and that you won't need them for all their information because you don't.
[04:08:10.925 --> 04:08:13.007]  And it's already proven people are looking up.
[04:08:13.740 --> 04:08:14.400]  Check out this, guys.
[04:08:14.420 --> 04:08:16.602]  Look up Wikileaks and Google Trends.
[04:08:17.102 --> 04:08:18.383]  Everybody's searching Wikileaks.
[04:08:19.223 --> 04:08:20.744]  Nobody cares about what Donald Trump's doing.
[04:08:21.384 --> 04:08:27.408]  The people out there that are searching for news, that are actually looking for news, not being forced, spoon-fed this information.
[04:08:28.328 --> 04:08:28.628]  Okay?
[04:08:29.289 --> 04:08:30.249]  So we need your support.
[04:08:30.489 --> 04:08:32.510]  Go to infowarsstore.com and check it out.
[04:08:33.451 --> 04:08:35.852]  Google Trends shows, yeah, there it is right there.
[04:08:36.493 --> 04:08:38.974]  You can see the spikes looking for Wikileaks and Podesta.
[04:08:39.554 --> 04:08:41.015]  Trump way down at the bottom.
[04:08:42.276 --> 04:08:42.496]  Okay?
[04:08:44.471 --> 04:08:46.372]  People are craving information.
[04:08:46.432 --> 04:09:02.557]  That's why, if you're just getting into this, we had a guy on Spanglevision just starting to make videos, just pointing out stuff that other people don't have time to point out, and going, hey, look, this girl's an actress, and her dad is, if you don't know what I'm talking about, Hillary Clinton had a press conference.
[04:09:03.476 --> 04:09:10.919]  And they were taking questions from the audience, and they had an actor, one of the actors from the Hunger Games, go, oh, little girl in the red bow, what's your question?
[04:09:11.239 --> 04:09:14.440]  And she wanted to talk about the bad things Donald Trump's saying and how hurtful they are.
[04:09:15.180 --> 04:09:21.903]  And she's an actress, and her dad is a Democratic state rep, or he's a state senator in Pennsylvania.
[04:09:22.363 --> 04:09:24.624]  Okay, it's obvious what they're trying to do to you folks.
[04:09:24.864 --> 04:09:25.504]  It's obvious.
[04:09:26.184 --> 04:09:27.045]  It is so obvious.
[04:09:28.625 --> 04:09:30.126]  And then we have this article from yesterday.
[04:09:32.080 --> 04:09:37.216]  FBI files on Hillary's email reveal shadow government was in charge of her investigation.
[04:09:40.629 --> 04:09:49.592]  A page from the FBI's public release documents from the investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server reveals that a group literally called the shadow government was overseeing the inquiry.
[04:09:50.232 --> 04:09:56.134]  There was a powerful group of very high-ranking state officials that some refer to as the seventh floor group or the shadow government.
[04:09:56.674 --> 04:10:04.616]  They met every Wednesday afternoon to discuss the FOIA process, congressional records and everything Clinton related to the FOIA congressional inquiries.
[04:10:05.196 --> 04:10:07.357]  And they even state the word shadow government
[04:10:07.977 --> 04:10:09.318]  And 7th floor group on page 56.
[04:10:10.299 --> 04:10:20.007]  And they include John Kerry, Jonathan Finer, Chief of Staff and Director of Policy and Planning at the State Department, and Patrick Kennedy, Undersecretary of State for Management.
[04:10:20.207 --> 04:10:21.909]  And I go, man, Patrick Kennedy.
[04:10:23.130 --> 04:10:24.091]  I remember that name.
[04:10:24.651 --> 04:10:26.032]  How do I remember Patrick Kennedy?
[04:10:26.693 --> 04:10:31.677]  And then I remember editing Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[04:10:32.500 --> 04:10:34.861]  And we were coming down to the end of it, and it was in December.
[04:10:34.881 --> 04:10:37.601]  We were getting stuff ready, and the underwear bomber happens.
[04:10:38.422 --> 04:10:44.223]  Do you know why, when you go into the airport, you have to walk through a body scanner and put your hands up, and they go, hands up!
[04:10:44.543 --> 04:10:45.244]  Like you're a prisoner.
[04:10:45.504 --> 04:10:46.424]  Do you know why we have that?
[04:10:47.584 --> 04:10:49.005]  Well, there is an incident.
[04:10:49.025 --> 04:10:54.746]  I believe it was December 25th, or December 26th of 2009.
[04:10:54.986 --> 04:10:58.807]  This is the underwear bomber incident, and you can look it up.
[04:10:59.728 --> 04:11:01.188]  I might have the date wrong by a couple days.
[04:11:04.382 --> 04:11:07.504]  It was Christmas Day 2009, December 25th, 2009.
[04:11:07.544 --> 04:11:11.206]  A flight was coming in from Amsterdam, flying into Detroit.
[04:11:12.607 --> 04:11:20.872]  And a stewardess smells smoke, and they see a guy trying to light a fuse on fire, or detonate some explosives that were encased in his underwear.
[04:11:22.311 --> 04:11:24.012]  Explosives were called P-E-T-N.
[04:11:24.772 --> 04:11:25.452]  P-E-T-N.
[04:11:25.472 --> 04:11:29.154]  It was the same type of explosive that the shoe bomber was wearing.
[04:11:29.174 --> 04:11:29.554]  Remember?
[04:11:30.014 --> 04:11:32.855]  Before the underwear bomber, we had to take off our shoes.
[04:11:33.115 --> 04:11:34.536]  Well, that's because of the shoe bomber.
[04:11:35.816 --> 04:11:41.018]  They were both given intentionally defective bombs because these bombs cannot be lit with a lighter.
[04:11:41.058 --> 04:11:42.779]  They have to have an electronic fuse.
[04:11:43.519 --> 04:11:45.240]  So you would think the terrorists would have learned
[04:11:46.650 --> 04:11:49.311]  That you had to have an electronic fuse to light these explosives.
[04:11:49.771 --> 04:11:56.074]  Or maybe they were given intentionally defective bombs so we could scare people into creating more of a police state.
[04:11:56.654 --> 04:12:02.797]  Well, Patrick Kennedy knew about the underwear bomber.
[04:12:03.077 --> 04:12:10.260]  In fact, they've been contacted by Abdul Muttalib's father, that's the underwear bomber, Abdul Farouk Muttalib.
[04:12:11.391 --> 04:12:16.615]  They were contacted by his father, who was a prominent banker, who said, hey man, my son's hanging out with some crazy people.
[04:12:16.635 --> 04:12:17.555]  Y'all ought to look into him.
[04:12:18.596 --> 04:12:22.879]  And so they put him on a list, but they didn't want to revoke his visa.
[04:12:23.099 --> 04:12:29.384]  In fact, they even state they didn't want to revoke his visa because they wanted to see who he was working with.
[04:12:30.605 --> 04:12:31.205]  That's what he said.
[04:12:31.425 --> 04:12:35.408]  And Patrick Kennedy said this under congressional oath in the testimony.
[04:12:35.448 --> 04:12:36.709]  I'm about to show you a clip from that.
[04:12:38.547 --> 04:12:49.883]  And what this means is that our government knew this guy was getting on the plane, and instead of coming out and saying that in the beginning, it had to come out three months later in congressional testimony, because the FBI says they knew nothing about it.
[04:12:50.504 --> 04:12:51.605]  And it gets even weirder.
[04:12:52.146 --> 04:12:53.688]  It gets even weirder!
[04:12:54.269 --> 04:13:03.474]  But let's just hear it from Patrick Kennedy himself, one of the main conspirators in the shadow government that is helping cover up for Hillary Clinton, and thereby stealing the election.
[04:13:03.494 --> 04:13:10.378]  Because if people knew about all the crimes the Clintons have done, if that was all put out in the open, there was no way people would vote for her.
[04:13:10.479 --> 04:13:13.520]  You know, unless they're diehard Hillary zombies, they're going to vote for her.
[04:13:13.861 --> 04:13:16.462]  Like Anthony DeFatni from Havertown.
[04:13:16.822 --> 04:13:18.283]  If you haven't seen the clip, it's out there.
[04:13:18.303 --> 04:13:19.564]  Ultimate Hillary zombie discovered.
[04:13:21.004 --> 04:13:24.425]  I feel sorry for that man, because he is a true Hillary believer.
[04:13:25.066 --> 04:13:34.770]  But let's play the clip from Patrick Kennedy, and you can hear in his lawyer language as he lays out the fact that they did not revoke his visa because they wanted to see who he's working with.
[04:13:35.250 --> 04:13:41.773]  But then why'd they let him on the plane, and then how did that turn into a so-called terror attack that we now have to have body scanners in the airports?
[04:13:42.193 --> 04:13:43.673]  Okay, you see how it all works together?
[04:13:44.314 --> 04:13:44.974]  Check out the clip.
[04:13:45.942 --> 04:13:58.507]  There have been numerous cases where our unilateral and uncoordinated revocation of the visa would have disrupted important investigations that were underway by one of our national security partners.
[04:13:59.147 --> 04:14:05.110]  They had the individual under investigation and our revocation action would have disclosed
[04:14:05.630 --> 04:14:05.910]  U.S.
[04:14:05.950 --> 04:14:16.778]  government's interest in that individual and ended our colleagues ability such as the FBI to pursue the case quietly and to identify terrorist plans and co-conspirators.
[04:14:17.098 --> 04:14:20.000]  Let me get to Mr. Abdulmutallab for one moment.
[04:14:22.101 --> 04:14:28.926]  Information became available last year to the State Department from his father and
[04:14:29.776 --> 04:14:40.787]  As I understand, that information was reviewed as to whether there was a visa outstanding in regards to that individual, and because of the spelling of the name, it didn't pop up on your data search.
[04:14:40.807 --> 04:14:41.468]  Is that correct?
[04:14:43.289 --> 04:14:44.470]  That is correct, Senator.
[04:14:45.231 --> 04:14:49.936]  We did, though, put the name correctly into our lookout system, and the lookout system
[04:14:50.882 --> 04:14:51.662]  We're good to go.
[04:15:11.684 --> 04:15:14.788]  Was obviated by the second message that paired up with it.
[04:15:14.828 --> 04:15:27.743]  We always consult with our law enforcement intelligence community partners before we will revoke a visa to make sure the individual is not a subject of investigation and we would compromise their investigation.
[04:15:29.005 --> 04:15:37.247]  Are you saying that even if it would have popped up that he had a visa outstanding, you would have not taken any action to revoke that visa?
[04:15:37.287 --> 04:15:53.731]  There was insufficient information to immediately revoke the visa and also following the protocols that have been in place since 2001, we checked with our partners in the intelligence and law enforcement communities to make sure that our revoking that visa does not tip him off
[04:15:54.211 --> 04:16:01.976]  So if you speak legalese and bureaucratic BS, basically what he was saying is, we didn't, we let this guy get on the plane because we wanted to see who he was working with.
[04:16:01.996 --> 04:16:04.978]  He's given an intentionally defective bomb that doesn't go off.
[04:16:23.687 --> 04:16:29.729]  And afterwards, the FBI doesn't want to talk about the mysterious well-dressed man, which we're going to get to in a second.
[04:16:29.769 --> 04:16:40.972]  Now, I realize this is from six years ago, and you probably think it doesn't matter, but you've been walking through naked body scanners that have the potential to unzip your DNA for six years now.
[04:16:41.892 --> 04:16:45.215]  And it's because of this fake false flag terror attack.
[04:16:45.776 --> 04:16:47.978]  And this is a true false flag attack by any other name.
[04:16:48.679 --> 04:16:49.640]  It is bonafide.
[04:16:50.240 --> 04:16:51.561]  Bonafide in triplicate.
[04:16:52.262 --> 04:16:54.805]  We got it just from Patrick Kennedy.
[04:16:54.985 --> 04:16:55.565]  You just saw that.
[04:16:56.337 --> 04:17:05.561]  How he said, we didn't revoke his visa because we knew other people were watching him, including the FBI, but he didn't want to name who exactly because they're going to get to that in closed session.
[04:17:06.201 --> 04:17:11.704]  Which is where they talk about all the juicy stuff that you're not supposed to hear because you're a stupid American and you're not allowed to hear this stuff.
[04:17:11.864 --> 04:17:13.084]  You're not allowed to hear this information.
[04:17:16.066 --> 04:17:23.389]  Right after the underwear bomber happened, we got a call or an email from a lawyer named Kurt Haskell who happened to be on the same flight.
[04:17:24.266 --> 04:17:27.028]  In fact, him and his wife are coming back from a safari in Africa.
[04:17:27.568 --> 04:17:31.791]  I've actually gone to his law office and interviewed the man right outside of Detroit.
[04:17:33.112 --> 04:17:42.538]  And what he said was, him and his wife were playing cards because they wanted to get seats next to each other on the flight home, so they were sitting right by the gate, waiting to talk to one of the ticket ladies.
[04:17:43.399 --> 04:17:53.646]  And they see a guy come up, and he's wearing a white t-shirt, and he looks like a poor African, and he's being accompanied by a well-dressed Indian who spoke with an English accent.
[04:17:55.757 --> 04:17:57.177]  Oh, well hey, don't take it from me.
[04:17:57.737 --> 04:17:59.438]  Let's actually listen to the man himself.
[04:17:59.478 --> 04:18:05.759]  This is Kurt Haskell describing what he saw on, I guess, either the day before or on Christmas Day 2009.
[04:18:06.379 --> 04:18:11.460]  I'm not sure what the time schedules were when he was taken off from Steeple Airport in Amsterdam.
[04:18:11.640 --> 04:18:11.980]  Here it is.
[04:18:13.521 --> 04:18:20.382]  And when we're playing cards, I looked up and what caught my eye was a pair of men walking up to the counter.
[04:18:21.565 --> 04:18:27.370]  And one looked like a wealthier Indian man to me, and the other looked like a poor African.
[04:18:28.171 --> 04:18:31.153]  I thought he was a teenager, but apparently he was a little older then.
[04:18:31.553 --> 04:18:33.335]  But he looked like a poor African teenager.
[04:18:33.395 --> 04:18:36.217]  He only had on jeans and a white t-shirt in the middle of winter.
[04:18:36.237 --> 04:18:42.122]  And, you know, I thought they were an odd pair, so I just kind of watched them as we were playing cards.
[04:18:42.182 --> 04:18:45.164]  And they went to the counter together.
[04:18:46.520 --> 04:18:54.046]  And the Indian-looking man spoke, and what he said was, this man needs to get on the flight, referring to the African teenager.
[04:18:56.728 --> 04:18:57.889]  But he doesn't have a passport.
[04:18:57.969 --> 04:19:03.092]  And then the girl working at the counter said, well, you have to have a passport to get on the flight.
[04:19:03.353 --> 04:19:06.715]  And then the Indian man said, well, he's from Sudan.
[04:19:07.235 --> 04:19:08.476]  We do this all the time.
[04:19:08.877 --> 04:19:11.499]  And that's an exact word-for-word quote.
[04:19:13.020 --> 04:19:19.424]  And she said something along the lines of, well, you know, I'll have to refer you to a manager or something like that.
[04:19:20.125 --> 04:19:29.751]  And I think she did something on her computer, and then she sent the two of them down a hallway, and they walked down the hallway together, which was in a restricted area.
[04:19:31.012 --> 04:19:35.715]  And they walked down there without an escort, and then, you know, I quit watching at that point.
[04:19:37.356 --> 04:19:38.497]  And it doesn't really
[04:19:40.140 --> 04:19:52.268]  Lay upon his conscience at that time until he is walking off the flight and he sees the police wrestling with Abdul Farooq Muttalib, who thought he was going to be blowing up a plane that day.
[04:19:53.489 --> 04:19:56.911]  And he didn't, because he was given a defective bomb that wouldn't work.
[04:19:58.513 --> 04:20:02.015]  Because, you know, ISIS doesn't know, or Al Qaeda doesn't know how to build bombs anymore.
[04:20:03.476 --> 04:20:07.178]  If you really believe that that's who was planning this attack, or this fake attack.
[04:20:08.459 --> 04:20:09.080]  It gets deeper.
[04:20:09.867 --> 04:20:19.031]  Michael Chertoff, our former head of Homeland Security, then goes out on television and starts saying, you know, we need naked body scanners.
[04:20:19.852 --> 04:20:31.497]  It's the only thing that's going to stop anything like this from happening is full body scanners that see through the clothing and can see if you're wearing any, if you have any kind of a bomb making device on you, in your underwear, in your bra.
[04:20:32.938 --> 04:20:34.859]  And they started hyping up bra bombs.
[04:20:36.787 --> 04:20:40.029]  And underwear bombs and fake prosthetic pregnant belly bombs.
[04:20:40.309 --> 04:20:41.570]  All these things that are going to happen.
[04:20:43.171 --> 04:20:45.873]  So they started not allowing you to bring food on the planes.
[04:20:45.993 --> 04:20:51.777]  And if you had baby formula, they'd make you dump it out and give the TSA license to act like tyrants.
[04:20:52.698 --> 04:20:55.660]  And we let all this happen because we, you know, didn't want to listen to this lawyer.
[04:20:55.700 --> 04:20:56.300]  We listened to him.
[04:20:56.320 --> 04:20:57.461]  We tried to put the information out.
[04:20:59.262 --> 04:21:06.127]  In fact, in February 2000, February 16, 2012, Kurt Haskell got to make a statement to the court.
[04:21:06.897 --> 04:21:09.681]  When they were trying Abdul Farooq Muttalib.
[04:21:10.882 --> 04:21:11.743]  It's a very interesting read.
[04:21:11.763 --> 04:21:12.524]  You should go back and read it.
[04:21:12.544 --> 04:21:15.468]  I've got the article right here if you want to shoot an overhead shot of it.
[04:21:15.508 --> 04:21:20.094]  Breaking Curt Haskell Exposes Government False Flag Operation During Underwear Bomber Sentencing.
[04:21:21.496 --> 04:21:22.678]  And he was allowed five minutes.
[04:21:24.537 --> 04:21:27.239]  To talk about what he saw that day.
[04:21:27.880 --> 04:21:37.428]  He witnessed him dressed in jeans, a white t-shirt, being escorted around security, you know, going behind closed doors by a man in a tan suit who spoke perfect American English.
[04:21:38.749 --> 04:21:40.531]  And he was got on board without a passport.
[04:21:40.871 --> 04:21:42.412]  Now, can you fly without a passport?
[04:21:43.573 --> 04:21:44.754]  Can I fly without a passport?
[04:21:44.975 --> 04:21:45.135]  No.
[04:21:45.996 --> 04:21:46.096]  No.
[04:21:46.536 --> 04:21:51.500]  You're not allowed to go anywhere without a passport, yet this guy was able to get on the plane without a passport.
[04:21:51.560 --> 04:21:52.241]  How does that happen?
[04:21:53.117 --> 04:21:53.757]  How does that happen?
[04:21:54.097 --> 04:21:54.878]  Well, he has a handler.
[04:21:55.578 --> 04:21:56.699]  The handler got him on the plane.
[04:21:57.759 --> 04:21:59.180]  And now you walk through naked body scanners.
[04:22:02.101 --> 04:22:03.362]  But what does it all go back to?
[04:22:04.122 --> 04:22:08.364]  One of the guys in the cover-up, Patrick Kennedy, is also helping cover up for Hillary.
[04:22:09.445 --> 04:22:09.685]  Okay?
[04:22:09.845 --> 04:22:11.586]  This is one of those faceless bureaucrats.
[04:22:11.626 --> 04:22:15.868]  If y'all could just pull a still frame of Patrick Kennedy up on screen, just so we can look at him, or just play the video.
[04:22:16.892 --> 04:22:17.733]  Without any audio.
[04:22:17.894 --> 04:22:22.100]  So I can sit here and examine this guy's facial mannerisms as he talks.
[04:22:22.140 --> 04:22:23.742]  He touches his nose a couple times.
[04:22:24.263 --> 04:22:25.044]  Means he's lying.
[04:22:27.488 --> 04:22:28.449]  Crazy stuff.
[04:22:28.469 --> 04:22:29.150]  Look, there he is.
[04:22:29.511 --> 04:22:32.195]  Patrick Kennedy, Undersecretary of State for Management.
[04:22:33.166 --> 04:22:36.107]  And that was on January 20th, 2010.
[04:22:36.287 --> 04:22:38.728]  That's when that video was taking place.
[04:22:38.788 --> 04:22:46.331]  And he's talking about how, well, it was a mistake because we didn't spell his name right on one list and it didn't corroborate with another list.
[04:22:46.391 --> 04:22:58.235]  And also we talked to some unnamed agencies and they didn't want us to stop him from getting on because maybe those unnamed agencies had ties to Michael Chertoff and, you know, they wanted a multi-million dollar body scanner contract.
[04:22:58.475 --> 04:22:59.295]  Because that's how it works.
[04:22:59.335 --> 04:23:00.196]  It works with looting.
[04:23:00.916 --> 04:23:05.518]  If you saw Dinesh D'Souza's movie, Hillary's America, all crime starts with stealing.
[04:23:06.338 --> 04:23:06.638]  Okay?
[04:23:06.958 --> 04:23:13.940]  And they're stealing your tax dollars to put these machines in to create the long lines to keep you from traveling because you're treated like a bad person.
[04:23:14.421 --> 04:23:18.922]  Meanwhile, we escort terrorists through the gate onto the plane.
[04:23:20.463 --> 04:23:20.783]  Alright?
[04:23:21.283 --> 04:23:24.424]  And if you think they stopped, if you think they're gonna stop, you're crazy.
[04:23:25.919 --> 04:23:28.439]  And that's what you have to think about when you go to the polls on November 8th.
[04:23:28.459 --> 04:23:41.682]  You have to think about, do I want somebody who has actively worked with terrorist groups, who admits that we funded these terrorist groups, who hasn't done a thing for anybody except for her big banking interests.
[04:23:42.462 --> 04:23:45.763]  If that's who you want, then go vote for Hillary Clinton and you get the hell you deserve.
[04:23:49.663 --> 04:23:51.384]  I'm not going to tell you you have to vote for Donald Trump.
[04:23:52.484 --> 04:23:53.204]  I'm going to vote for Trump.
[04:23:55.043 --> 04:23:57.464]  In fact, I think we have some Trump is my president shirts coming in.
[04:23:57.785 --> 04:23:59.025]  Hey, can you guys see if we have those?
[04:23:59.085 --> 04:24:01.747]  I would love to show everybody if we got them in.
[04:24:01.887 --> 04:24:07.570]  I was talking to Weldon the other day, our shipping manager, and he said they should be in today or tomorrow.
[04:24:07.750 --> 04:24:11.673]  So if they're in today, I'd love to show one off because that's the shirt you need to wear on election day.
[04:24:11.993 --> 04:24:12.393]  There it is.
[04:24:12.473 --> 04:24:13.794]  Trump is my president.
[04:24:15.455 --> 04:24:16.195]  Nice and red.
[04:24:16.215 --> 04:24:20.838]  And it lets people know who you're voting for.
[04:24:23.055 --> 04:24:23.515]  Right there.
[04:24:23.576 --> 04:24:25.818]  It's got Infowars.com on the back.
[04:24:30.582 --> 04:24:33.185]  It definitely will trigger the Hillary Bull tacos out there.
[04:24:34.366 --> 04:24:34.906]  Definitely.
[04:24:35.787 --> 04:24:37.309]  So I want to go to your calls too.
[04:24:37.929 --> 04:24:39.030]  I'm not sure how we're going to set this up.
[04:24:39.050 --> 04:24:41.533]  I don't know if we've ever done live calls from this part of the studio.
[04:24:42.053 --> 04:24:42.934]  So we're going to try it.
[04:24:44.206 --> 04:24:44.746]  877-789-2539.
[04:24:44.766 --> 04:24:45.086]  877-789-2539.
[04:24:45.106 --> 04:25:04.994]  Guys, I want to get Darren McBreen set up here in a little bit when we play the creepy Joe Biden montage, just to give you guys a heads up.
[04:25:05.834 --> 04:25:06.974]  I put this out yesterday.
[04:25:07.215 --> 04:25:13.557]  There was an article about Trump tweeting, Joe Biden fondling women.
[04:25:15.069 --> 04:25:17.071]  And I looked at it and I go, man, there's a lot more out there.
[04:25:17.191 --> 04:25:18.031]  There's so much more.
[04:25:18.372 --> 04:25:21.955]  This guy is a total, total creepazoid.
[04:25:23.136 --> 04:25:31.983]  The vice president is in charge of swearing in the senators when they come in because, you know, the vice president is the deciding vote in the Senate because there's 52 from each state.
[04:25:32.443 --> 04:25:32.784]  So he's 101.
[04:25:32.924 --> 04:25:33.544]  He's the 101st vote.
[04:25:33.564 --> 04:25:34.045]  He's the tiebreaker.
[04:25:36.277 --> 04:25:39.959]  So his job is also to swear in the new senators at the new session.
[04:25:40.239 --> 04:25:41.720]  And then he takes pictures with their family.
[04:25:41.740 --> 04:25:42.701]  It's a big family event.
[04:25:43.401 --> 04:25:50.445]  Well, Joe uses this opportunity to grab and touch little girls.
[04:25:51.526 --> 04:25:55.428]  It's super creepy, super freaking creepy.
[04:25:55.768 --> 04:26:01.611]  And I don't know if these senators are unaware or if it's just an unspoken rule that you let Joe Biden fondle your daughter.
[04:26:01.631 --> 04:26:02.652]  I don't know.
[04:26:03.968 --> 04:26:07.411]  But there's this little girl in a red dress that he goes, you come on over here.
[04:26:07.451 --> 04:26:08.231]  You're going to get with me.
[04:26:08.271 --> 04:26:10.673]  And he puts his arm right around right here at her belly.
[04:26:12.314 --> 04:26:15.737]  No, you don't touch other people's children like that.
[04:26:17.398 --> 04:26:18.539]  Unless you're a freaking pervert.
[04:26:20.060 --> 04:26:21.021]  Or a serial groper.
[04:26:22.462 --> 04:26:26.045]  And Joe Biden's been in the Senate for a long time before he's vice president.
[04:26:26.085 --> 04:26:27.426]  He's been vice president for years.
[04:26:29.388 --> 04:26:30.749]  I think that's the tweet, right?
[04:26:31.752 --> 04:26:34.474]  Yeah, I've got a whole little montage that I've put together.
[04:26:35.675 --> 04:26:48.223]  And we're gonna go to that, and then let's go to a short break, and then we're gonna have Jeremy Breen in here talking about Brexit, and how the polls, when Brexit was about to get voted on, were like, oh man, Brexit's gonna lose.
[04:26:48.903 --> 04:26:50.184]  Nobody's gonna vote for it.
[04:26:50.724 --> 04:26:51.685]  Just like they're doing now.
[04:26:52.125 --> 04:26:54.387]  Saying, man, Hillary's got this in the bag.
[04:26:54.867 --> 04:26:56.928]  They're trying to convince you not to go out and vote.
[04:26:57.348 --> 04:26:59.550]  Because they've got about four million votes to play with.
[04:27:01.789 --> 04:27:05.731]  There's dead and unregistered and wrongly registered voters out there.
[04:27:05.771 --> 04:27:09.372]  They're saying about four million messed up voter registrations.
[04:27:09.992 --> 04:27:15.995]  They're either dead, or it's the wrong state, or it's a person that, you know, is ineligible to vote.
[04:27:16.075 --> 04:27:16.635]  Four million.
[04:27:16.675 --> 04:27:17.615]  That's a lot to play with.
[04:27:17.675 --> 04:27:21.377]  And we've got them on tape saying they're going to steal the election.
[04:27:21.397 --> 04:27:22.197]  They don't care.
[04:27:23.157 --> 04:27:23.798]  They don't care.
[04:27:24.158 --> 04:27:27.579]  So there has to be overwhelming votes for Trump.
[04:27:27.619 --> 04:27:29.900]  He has to win overwhelmingly, or they're going to steal it.
[04:27:31.618 --> 04:27:33.659]  And then once they steal this, it's over.
[04:27:34.239 --> 04:27:37.901]  Because they know, they go, we can do anything to these stupid suckers.
[04:27:38.502 --> 04:27:41.543]  These lovable idiots that trust everything we say.
[04:27:41.563 --> 04:27:42.604]  Yeah, we're going to help you.
[04:27:43.084 --> 04:27:44.085]  You think they're going to help you?
[04:27:45.005 --> 04:27:46.386]  They're going to help you so much.
[04:27:47.066 --> 04:27:50.428]  Your current vice president fondles women out in the open.
[04:27:51.068 --> 04:27:52.349]  Little girls out in the open.
[04:27:52.649 --> 04:27:53.790]  Nothing is done about it.
[04:27:54.550 --> 04:27:55.370]  Nobody cares.
[04:27:55.731 --> 04:27:56.591]  Nobody stops it.
[04:27:56.891 --> 04:28:00.073]  In fact, they laugh while it's happening because it's so cool.
[04:28:03.526 --> 04:28:06.087]  Oh, yeah, here's Alex Jones coming in right now.
[04:28:06.868 --> 04:28:08.569]  I'm talking bad about Joe Biden, I'm sorry.
[04:28:08.849 --> 04:28:14.192]  CNN says there's no such thing as election fraud, except the Russians are taking over.
[04:28:14.212 --> 04:28:20.736]  That's why Homeland Security has to federalize it for the non-existent kook Trump that says there's election fraud.
[04:28:20.756 --> 04:28:22.658]  But it doesn't exist, but they're taking over because of it.
[04:28:22.838 --> 04:28:26.120]  But then the heads of the major campaign that run it admit we're stealing everything.
[04:28:26.140 --> 04:28:27.421]  F everyone!
[04:28:28.519 --> 04:28:29.099]  Isn't it crazy?
[04:28:29.159 --> 04:28:30.220]  But hey, Obamacare's free!
[04:28:30.400 --> 04:28:30.620]  Yeah.
[04:28:31.240 --> 04:28:31.741]  And guess what?
[04:28:31.761 --> 04:28:34.242]  They stole all the Haiti money, but it's okay because it's liberal!
[04:28:34.902 --> 04:28:35.443]  They love us.
[04:28:35.503 --> 04:28:47.669]  They love the black people so much they're gonna take a whole island of black people and steal money that was meant for them and spend it on their vacation houses that good Americans gave, that you gave them.
[04:28:47.709 --> 04:28:49.510]  Told you, you have to give it or you're a racist.
[04:28:49.830 --> 04:28:51.512]  Yeah.
[04:28:51.553 --> 04:28:56.319]  They know what to do with your money and they, you know what, they did know what to do with it.
[04:28:56.359 --> 04:28:57.441]  They kept it for themselves.
[04:28:57.721 --> 04:28:59.364]  They created jobs for them and their friends.
[04:29:03.226 --> 04:29:05.567]  She stole the State Department Furniture too!
[04:29:20.472 --> 04:29:21.853]  I have two Larry Nichols clips.
[04:29:22.233 --> 04:29:24.635]  Let's play the one, what Trump has to do during the debate.
[04:29:24.675 --> 04:29:27.196]  This is today on the Alex Jones Show, just like an hour and a half ago.
[04:29:27.597 --> 04:29:30.178]  He came out and said, this is what Trump has to do during the debate.
[04:29:30.418 --> 04:29:33.080]  And if he doesn't do this, it's finished.
[04:29:33.260 --> 04:29:34.060]  But he has to do this.
[04:29:34.100 --> 04:29:34.781]  He's got no choice.
[04:29:35.141 --> 04:29:37.022]  He is surrounded by the enemy.
[04:29:37.562 --> 04:29:39.383]  This is Trump's last stand, literally, tonight.
[04:29:39.844 --> 04:29:40.604]  You got that clip ready?
[04:29:41.345 --> 04:29:41.885]  Let's go to it.
[04:29:42.645 --> 04:29:44.447]  Here's what Trump has to do.
[04:29:44.747 --> 04:29:51.513]  When he gets on that stage, he needs to close his eyes, Alex, and pretend there's nobody in that room, no interviewer, no Hillary.
[04:29:51.994 --> 04:29:58.800]  And when he gets two minutes, he needs to start talking about whatever the issue is he wants to talk about.
[04:29:58.820 --> 04:30:05.826]  He needs to say, I want to talk directly to the American people and say, if you're tired of the past and being ripped off and all the corruption,
[04:30:06.807 --> 04:30:10.190]  You've seen all the rigging and the fake polls, the demonization of lies.
[04:30:10.731 --> 04:30:14.294]  If you want a real change, the whole establishment's against me.
[04:30:14.654 --> 04:30:15.835]  You've never seen anything like this.
[04:30:15.875 --> 04:30:18.557]  It's because they've got it rigged, a bunch of insiders.
[04:30:19.591 --> 04:30:20.672]  I'm going to bring in term limits.
[04:30:21.012 --> 04:30:22.093]  I'm going to cut your taxes.
[04:30:23.053 --> 04:30:25.175]  It's basic stuff that will bring this country back.
[04:30:25.195 --> 04:30:31.519]  If you want to go with the old mafia, you want to buy their lies, you go ahead and vote for this lady right here.
[04:30:31.759 --> 04:30:35.522]  But I'm here to tell you, our internal polls show I'm way ahead.
[04:30:35.802 --> 04:30:43.067]  Then they've got these polls where they sample 30, 40, 50, 60 percent more Democrats in the poll and then say that I'm losing.
[04:30:43.347 --> 04:30:48.190]  Folks, the fix is in and I'm asking the American people, I've been fighting for you, but you've got to fight for me.
[04:30:48.470 --> 04:30:49.251]  We're in this together.
[04:30:49.671 --> 04:30:52.074]  That's right, and he's got to look right at the camera.
[04:30:52.134 --> 04:30:55.557]  When they start hollering at him, Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, answer the questions.
[04:30:55.597 --> 04:30:56.718]  Don't even hear them.
[04:30:57.018 --> 04:30:58.860]  Go on and finish your statement.
[04:30:59.281 --> 04:31:01.923]  Look, somebody's going to say, well, that's not fair.
[04:31:02.124 --> 04:31:09.251]  Let me tell you, this gathering tonight is not going to be fair if he whips Hillary every way but loose.
[04:31:10.012 --> 04:31:12.114]  The media is going to spin it the next day.
[04:31:12.174 --> 04:31:14.555]  You saw it happen with the second debate, Alex.
[04:31:14.635 --> 04:31:16.337]  The next day, the media is going to say lost.
[04:31:16.857 --> 04:31:21.841]  The next day, the media is going to pull snippets out and they're going to spin them the way they want to.
[04:31:21.921 --> 04:31:23.862]  So he's up against the stack deck.
[04:31:24.222 --> 04:31:25.123]  Have courage.
[04:31:25.343 --> 04:31:26.584]  Look into that camera.
[04:31:26.644 --> 04:31:31.007]  Realize this is the last chance, Alex, he has to talk to 50 to 60
[04:31:32.308 --> 04:31:35.092]  And tell the American people it's their last chance.
[04:31:35.392 --> 04:31:35.873]  That's right.
[04:31:35.933 --> 04:31:50.252]  And point Hillary and say you're a communist Chinese agent, you've been exposed with the shadow government, the WikiLeaks have destroyed you, you tried to bribe the FBI to say you didn't have classified documents, you should be in handcuffs right now for criminal espionage and racketeering.
[04:31:51.940 --> 04:31:53.001]  So that's what Trump has to do.
[04:31:53.221 --> 04:32:03.431]  He has to, out of the gates, pretend that little backstabbing moderator Chris Wallace, that little feeble wimp, is gonna try to slip up Trump.
[04:32:03.831 --> 04:32:08.536]  Well, Donald, did you say this back in 2002?
[04:32:09.256 --> 04:32:10.758]  Did you talk to a woman back in 2004?
[04:32:12.944 --> 04:32:13.845]  That's all they're worried about.
[04:32:13.865 --> 04:32:18.727]  They're not worried about a bona fide criminal standing right in front of you because they're invested in that system.
[04:32:19.248 --> 04:32:25.991]  And the mainstream media is invested and they have to have that corrupt elite to take care of them.
[04:32:26.872 --> 04:32:28.713]  Just like they take care of, it's a quid pro quo.
[04:32:29.614 --> 04:32:30.794]  The media will take care of them.
[04:32:30.814 --> 04:32:33.336]  And you take care and the media.
[04:32:34.400 --> 04:32:37.161]  The politicians take care of the media, the media takes care of the politicians.
[04:32:37.601 --> 04:32:38.421]  That's how it works.
[04:32:39.261 --> 04:32:41.421]  Over and over and over again.
[04:32:42.902 --> 04:32:47.903]  Guys, let me know when we have callers on the line or who we have, because I don't have any way of seeing that.
[04:32:48.583 --> 04:32:55.504]  And we're going to go to callers probably after Darren McBreen leaves, or maybe I'll take a couple callers with Darren.
[04:32:56.164 --> 04:32:59.365]  But I want to go to this little compilation right now.
[04:32:59.405 --> 04:33:00.785]  We haven't gone to break in about 30 minutes.
[04:33:01.877 --> 04:33:09.545]  I just kind of exposed one of the inner workings of the shadow government and showed you another instance where they tried to cover things up.
[04:33:09.625 --> 04:33:10.446]  That was Patrick Kennedy.
[04:33:10.466 --> 04:33:17.373]  Now I'm going to show you your vice president groping little girls out in the open and he should be ashamed of himself.
[04:33:18.354 --> 04:33:21.117]  He should resign and he should leave public office.
[04:33:22.051 --> 04:33:27.715]  And let me tell you, Trump put out his five-point plan about how to get rid of corruption, and I tweeted out a couple things.
[04:33:27.835 --> 04:33:31.958]  Oh, you also need to add term limits, Trump, because that's the big problem, term limits.
[04:33:32.198 --> 04:33:35.080]  These people get in there, and they're like an Alabama tick.
[04:33:35.120 --> 04:33:37.141]  They just get in there, and they're dug in, and they're not leaving.
[04:33:37.161 --> 04:33:40.984]  I think it was Jesse Ventura said that in Predator.
[04:33:41.929 --> 04:33:44.371]  And you have to have term limits on these people.
[04:33:44.671 --> 04:33:51.435]  I think you have one six-year term for the president, one eight-year term for a senator, one four-year term for a representative, and you flush them out.
[04:33:51.735 --> 04:33:54.616]  There's plenty of people in this country who can help run it, okay?
[04:33:54.837 --> 04:34:04.522]  We don't need the same losers over and over again stealing our money, getting unvetted pensions, getting the best health care in the world while they shovel Obamacare at you and tell you it's free.
[04:34:05.883 --> 04:34:09.365]  And as they fine people I work with here in this office for not getting it,
[04:34:12.446 --> 04:34:22.469]  Okay, while they live lavishly, and they're, oh, I'm a public servant, but I don't have to listen to you, I don't have to answer your questions, I don't have to take your, I only work three days a week, too, by the way.
[04:34:22.489 --> 04:34:23.789]  I work Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
[04:34:25.050 --> 04:34:26.730]  And I get my salary for the rest of my life.
[04:34:28.091 --> 04:34:28.771]  And you pay for it.
[04:34:30.185 --> 04:34:31.145]  You gotta do away with all that.
[04:34:31.425 --> 04:34:35.567]  Because then only the people that really want to get in and do good are going to go into that position.
[04:34:35.887 --> 04:34:37.188]  Because they're not going to want to be there forever.
[04:34:37.208 --> 04:34:38.068]  They're not going to be lifers.
[04:34:38.548 --> 04:34:44.070]  So let's go to creepy Joe Biden, then we're going to go to a short break, and then we're going to be back with Derren McBreen talking about Brexit, and we're going to take your phone calls.
[04:34:44.370 --> 04:34:49.372]  Thank you for watching the 13-hour final debate countdown between Hillary and Donald Trump.
[04:34:49.412 --> 04:34:52.713]  Don't forget to go to InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[04:34:52.893 --> 04:34:57.535]  25% off Brain Force, Hillary for prison shirts at cost, and we got
[04:34:58.135 --> 04:35:00.037]  Living Defense back in and it's all free shipping.
[04:35:00.537 --> 04:35:01.198]  Let's roll the tape.
[04:35:15.331 --> 04:35:20.553]  Come on, you jump in here.
[04:35:20.593 --> 04:35:27.096]  Come on, you jump in here.
[04:35:46.426 --> 04:35:48.147]  We're good to go.
[04:35:48.227 --> 04:35:49.747]  We're good to go.
[04:36:11.246 --> 04:36:15.009]  Dad's gonna stand pretty close.
[04:36:15.389 --> 04:36:16.150]  Here we go.
[04:36:16.250 --> 04:36:17.230]  Here we go.
[04:36:17.330 --> 04:36:17.531]  I do.
[04:36:43.615 --> 04:36:46.217]  It's just so nice to see you, baby.
[04:36:46.237 --> 04:36:47.557]  How old are you?
[04:36:47.898 --> 04:36:48.558]  Thirteen.
[04:36:48.658 --> 04:36:53.461]  My dad and stepmom and brother got cut off there.
[04:36:53.661 --> 04:36:54.561]  Oh, come on!
[04:36:54.581 --> 04:36:55.562]  Let's get him here again.
[04:36:55.622 --> 04:36:56.302]  How are you?
[04:36:56.363 --> 04:36:58.764]  Good to see you, Dad.
[04:36:59.264 --> 04:37:02.986]  Maggie, do you want to come over here?
[04:37:03.207 --> 04:37:06.468]  Come on, make me look better.
[04:37:13.828 --> 04:37:21.251]  Thank you.
[04:37:21.291 --> 04:37:21.851]  Thank you.
[04:37:22.011 --> 04:37:22.551]  Thank you.
[04:37:22.591 --> 04:37:23.332]  Thank you.
[04:37:39.636 --> 04:37:41.437]  Alright, well nice to see you guys.
[04:37:41.797 --> 04:37:42.357]  Thank you.
[04:37:42.377 --> 04:37:43.417]  See you back home, I hope.
[04:37:44.498 --> 04:37:46.878]  Would you want your daughter to hold the Bible?
[04:37:46.898 --> 04:37:48.179]  You jump in the middle, Angel.
[04:37:48.219 --> 04:37:50.219]  You come right on this side of Mommy.
[04:37:50.339 --> 04:37:51.220]  No, you come over here.
[04:37:51.460 --> 04:37:51.840]  That's it.
[04:37:52.520 --> 04:37:52.840]  Keep going.
[04:37:52.860 --> 04:37:55.241]  You're gonna stand right next to me.
[04:37:55.681 --> 04:38:01.983]  And then we're gonna have Daddy put his left hand in the Bible if he can.
[04:38:02.023 --> 04:38:04.264]  You can re-reach it and repeat it.
[04:38:04.324 --> 04:38:06.525]  We're just gonna, hey man, here we go.
[04:38:06.545 --> 04:38:07.025]  You ready?
[04:38:07.845 --> 04:38:09.948]  Do you solemnly swear they will support you?
[04:38:09.968 --> 04:38:10.508]  God love you.
[04:38:10.528 --> 04:38:12.871]  You're a lucky man.
[04:38:13.571 --> 04:38:14.152]  He's having fun.
[04:38:14.192 --> 04:38:14.733]  Thank you, sir.
[04:38:14.793 --> 04:38:15.794]  Thank you.
[04:38:15.994 --> 04:38:18.016]  Thank you.
[04:38:18.056 --> 04:38:18.837]  Thank you.
[04:38:19.137 --> 04:38:22.281]  What a beautiful man.
[04:38:22.341 --> 04:38:23.642]  That's all of my children.
[04:38:23.662 --> 04:38:24.223]  Very good.
[04:38:25.364 --> 04:38:26.525]  Come on, slide across.
[04:38:26.906 --> 04:38:27.687]  Get everybody in.
[04:38:30.336 --> 04:38:31.397]  You switch here.
[04:38:31.497 --> 04:38:33.078]  You two come here.
[04:38:33.158 --> 04:38:33.938]  Here we go.
[04:38:33.978 --> 04:38:35.079]  You got it?
[04:38:35.119 --> 04:38:35.359]  Okay.
[04:38:35.439 --> 04:38:40.582]  And if you want the back, you can spread out a little bit.
[04:38:40.762 --> 04:38:41.182]  Okay.
[04:38:41.482 --> 04:38:46.965]  And if you want the back, you can spread out a little bit.
[04:38:47.546 --> 04:38:48.346]  Okay.
[04:38:48.646 --> 04:38:55.290]  And if you want the back, you can spread out a little bit.
[04:39:09.237 --> 04:39:13.598]  We're going to look up the photographer up top.
[04:39:13.878 --> 04:39:18.959]  Oh, there he is.
[04:39:26.568 --> 04:39:27.368]  Of course I would.
[04:39:27.408 --> 04:39:28.949]  She couldn't make it.
[04:39:28.989 --> 04:39:31.149]  What's her name?
[04:39:31.549 --> 04:39:32.670]  Ready to race?
[04:39:33.210 --> 04:39:33.910]  Come on.
[04:39:34.010 --> 04:39:35.530]  Okay, here we go.
[04:39:35.770 --> 04:39:36.310]  You ready?
[04:39:36.610 --> 04:39:40.091]  What a beautiful sound.
[04:39:40.251 --> 04:39:44.772]  Alright, here we go.
[04:39:45.113 --> 04:39:54.055]  Alright, we got up top here.
[04:39:54.075 --> 04:39:54.635]  Look up there.
[04:39:54.655 --> 04:39:55.195]  Okay, up there.
[04:39:59.650 --> 04:40:06.577]  I don't know about you, but if at all, I'm going to buy this.
[04:40:21.215 --> 04:40:21.855]  Yes, she is.
[04:40:21.975 --> 04:40:26.096]  Let's get some on this side.
[04:40:26.756 --> 04:40:32.737]  I know I'm a Democrat, but I'm okay.
[04:40:33.918 --> 04:40:35.278]  Come on up.
[04:40:35.338 --> 04:40:36.558]  Balance is off.
[04:40:56.519 --> 04:41:01.823]  You know how much it means to me to have you where we are today.
[04:41:01.863 --> 04:41:02.504]  And confidence.
[04:41:03.004 --> 04:41:05.266]  We've got a lot of thanks to give out here.
[04:41:55.521 --> 04:41:59.806]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[04:42:02.469 --> 04:42:04.472]  Americanism, not globalism!
[04:42:06.187 --> 04:42:13.272]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[04:42:13.652 --> 04:42:26.861]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[04:42:39.696 --> 04:42:45.662]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[04:43:06.424 --> 04:43:09.105]  Look, I'm not going to sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[04:43:09.306 --> 04:43:12.367]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[04:43:12.707 --> 04:43:13.447]  Because it's already here.
[04:43:13.828 --> 04:43:14.488]  It's being announced.
[04:43:14.848 --> 04:43:18.310]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.

[04:43:23.712 --> 04:43:24.553]  Available right now.
[04:43:24.813 --> 04:43:25.993]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[04:43:26.013 --> 04:43:28.975]  Are you going to sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[04:43:28.995 --> 04:43:30.616]  Or are you going to be part of history?

[04:43:40.614 --> 04:43:42.796]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[04:43:42.916 --> 04:43:49.743]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[04:43:49.963 --> 04:43:53.226]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[04:43:53.246 --> 04:43:54.427]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[04:43:54.727 --> 04:43:56.569]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[04:43:56.889 --> 04:44:02.171]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do, this is sustainable.
[04:44:02.291 --> 04:44:06.273]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[04:44:06.473 --> 04:44:09.654]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[04:44:09.694 --> 04:44:12.735]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[04:44:12.875 --> 04:44:14.256]  We're looking at the television screen.
[04:44:14.296 --> 04:44:19.998]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[04:44:20.038 --> 04:44:25.221]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com.

[04:44:28.983 --> 04:44:29.883]  And we thank you for your support.
[04:44:36.857 --> 04:44:39.598]  Welcome back to the 13 hours of coverage.
[04:44:39.638 --> 04:44:44.120]  Just like Benghazi was 13 hours long and that was Hillary's great stand down.
[04:44:44.360 --> 04:44:45.620]  We're going to have 13 hours.
[04:44:45.660 --> 04:44:47.981]  We're just a snack dab in the middle of it right now.
[04:44:48.001 --> 04:44:51.763]  We're going to go all the way to midnight tonight covering the debate.
[04:44:52.043 --> 04:44:52.523]  And then some.
[04:44:52.563 --> 04:44:53.023]  Off camera.
[04:44:54.944 --> 04:44:56.125]  We'll be producing reports.
[04:44:56.145 --> 04:44:57.825]  We're going to be here for a while.
[04:44:58.126 --> 04:45:11.832]  We're doing it for you out there because people are craving the alternative perspective that isn't driven by corporate mainstream dollars that are basically lying to you right now, telling you you can't look at WikiLeaks emails or it's against the law, and that you have to trust us.
[04:45:11.912 --> 04:45:13.092]  We're CNN.
[04:45:13.252 --> 04:45:14.333]  And trust the polls.
[04:45:14.573 --> 04:45:17.674]  And pretend that all these polls that we've come out are so great.
[04:45:18.174 --> 04:45:23.257]  In fact, you have to trust us so much, we have people working in a shadow government helping Hillary out.
[04:45:23.957 --> 04:45:33.463]  And I forgot to go to this article when I was talking about the Underwear Bomber, but in 2012, BBC had an article titled, Al-Qaeda Underwear Bomber Was an Undercover Agent.
[04:45:34.343 --> 04:45:35.404]  Nope, that's not the right one.
[04:45:35.424 --> 04:45:37.005]  It was sentenced to life, though.
[04:45:37.625 --> 04:45:38.706]  But this is from May 10th.
[04:45:39.706 --> 04:45:42.288]  Al-Qaeda Underwear Bomber Was an Undercover Agent.
[04:45:43.749 --> 04:45:46.171]  But then why did we have a trial for him if he was an undercover agent?
[04:45:46.211 --> 04:45:47.752]  Why did we put him in jail?
[04:45:47.772 --> 04:45:48.672]  Why is he in jail right now?
[04:45:48.913 --> 04:45:50.454]  Look, he's an undercover agent.
[04:45:50.514 --> 04:45:51.474]  It's the BBC.
[04:45:52.475 --> 04:45:52.855]  Wow.
[04:45:53.296 --> 04:45:57.559]  The would-be suicide attacker in the full-on underwear bomber plot was an undercover agent, U.S.
[04:45:57.599 --> 04:45:58.199]  officials say.
[04:45:58.599 --> 04:45:59.680]  Oh, now he's an undercover agent.
[04:46:00.521 --> 04:46:03.163]  But when Michael Chertoff was running around telling us we needed body scanners,
[04:46:04.246 --> 04:46:05.126]  He wasn't an undercover agent.
[04:46:05.146 --> 04:46:06.386]  He was a terrorist that they stopped.
[04:46:06.607 --> 04:46:09.347]  He wanted body scanners before that event even took place.
[04:46:09.567 --> 04:46:13.468]  It was by the luck of Providence that his bomb did not go off.
[04:46:13.608 --> 04:46:13.828]  Yeah.
[04:46:14.508 --> 04:46:22.030]  The person dispatched by Yemen-based al-Qaeda to attack a U.S.-bound plane had been recruited to infiltrate the group by Saudi Arabia in an apparent intelligence coup.
[04:46:22.350 --> 04:46:24.130]  No, this guy was an idiot loser.
[04:46:24.190 --> 04:46:26.831]  Even his dad said the guy is mentally deficient.
[04:46:27.031 --> 04:46:27.191]  Yeah.
[04:46:27.451 --> 04:46:28.351]  Mentally deficient.
[04:46:28.391 --> 04:46:30.012]  He got escorted right on the plane too.
[04:46:30.032 --> 04:46:30.912]  Just like the shoe bomber.
[04:46:31.966 --> 04:46:32.326]  Oh yeah.
[04:46:32.707 --> 04:46:33.887]  This guy's a spy.
[04:46:34.668 --> 04:46:38.010]  He's a spy like... But he didn't have an ID, right?
[04:46:38.030 --> 04:46:39.131]  Didn't they try to stop him?
[04:46:39.251 --> 04:46:41.193]  They tried to stop him from going on the plane.
[04:46:41.753 --> 04:46:42.173]  No, no.
[04:46:42.533 --> 04:46:44.255]  They had a handle to get him on the plane.
[04:46:44.275 --> 04:46:50.259]  They had a guy bring him on the plane.
[04:46:50.879 --> 04:46:54.322]  The agent who got him on was a British national, possibly of Middle Eastern origin.
[04:46:54.562 --> 04:46:56.083]  But UK officials have declined to comment.
[04:46:56.103 --> 04:46:57.524]  That's the well-dressed man, the Indian.
[04:46:57.544 --> 04:46:58.324]  The well-dressed man.
[04:46:58.345 --> 04:46:58.725]  I remember.
[04:46:58.945 --> 04:47:00.106]  He spoke perfect English.
[04:47:01.941 --> 04:47:03.323]  Ah, so there you go.
[04:47:03.343 --> 04:47:16.500]  Had nothing to do with terrorism, had to do with spy games that we were doing, yet they got on the TV and Vermont scared you as everybody's sitting at home for Christmas with their families glued to the TV going, Underwear Bomber!
[04:47:17.369 --> 04:47:21.692]  Well they always use scare tactics and now they're trying to scare you into voting for Hillary.
[04:47:22.212 --> 04:47:32.520]  Well not only that, actually what they're doing with Trump supporters, Fox News even had their own poll recently that shows a drop in Trump supporters enthusiasm.
[04:47:33.160 --> 04:47:42.725]  Right, so they're saying that because they say Trump supporters are seeing the latest polls worldwide or nationwide that have Hillary Clinton up by six points right now.
[04:47:42.765 --> 04:47:45.527]  She's leading 45 to 39 percent.
[04:47:46.227 --> 04:47:52.011]  So now Trump voters are getting, they're not very encouraged, they're expected to stay home and not vote.
[04:47:52.391 --> 04:47:53.812]  Don't believe the hype.
[04:47:54.132 --> 04:47:56.573]  Remember what happened to Brexit.
[04:47:57.234 --> 04:48:01.036]  The overwhelming majority of the polls showed Brexit not happening.
[04:48:02.174 --> 04:48:14.659]  And the lead up to it was, don't vote for Brexit, you're going to lose, you're going to lose, and the people... And it's going to be a financial crisis, it'll be a financial meltdown, don't do it, so there's another... And there was like a little dip for a day, and then it went back up even higher.
[04:48:14.779 --> 04:48:21.201]  Because people saw what was really going to happen, and when people started analyzing the real numbers, they go, oh wait, they're not going to be under all these EU regulations?
[04:48:21.641 --> 04:48:24.423]  Oh, hmm, we're actually going to make more money than we thought before.
[04:48:24.443 --> 04:48:30.585]  I know we were lying to the people, because we like all these illegal immigrants coming in, but we're just going to go ahead, and now we're going to make money off the deal.
[04:48:30.885 --> 04:48:33.667]  Because these people don't really care what the deal is, they know how to make money off it.
[04:48:33.687 --> 04:48:35.249]  And I gotta be honest, I fell for it.
[04:48:35.549 --> 04:48:39.312]  Because I remember walking around the office telling everybody, don't get your hopes up.
[04:48:39.753 --> 04:48:40.893]  Because it's not going to happen.
[04:48:41.014 --> 04:48:41.914]  Brexit's not going to happen.
[04:48:41.934 --> 04:48:43.235]  And that's how people are feeling now.
[04:48:43.316 --> 04:48:50.321]  But if you look at the search results, the Facebook impressions that Donald Trump, look up Facebook and Donald Trump impressions.
[04:48:50.381 --> 04:48:52.403]  It's like breaking records everywhere.
[04:48:52.443 --> 04:48:54.445]  Well, we all know that wherever he goes...
[04:48:54.685 --> 04:48:57.647]  I just gotta say, first of all, if this is how these people speak about
[04:49:24.674 --> 04:49:26.795]  Everything and even each other and these emails.
[04:49:27.176 --> 04:49:33.660]  Can you even imagine how these weird little degenerates act whenever like there's nothing on record at all?
[04:49:33.680 --> 04:49:38.563]  Because they obviously know that email isn't, you know, the most secure thing in the world.
[04:49:38.823 --> 04:49:47.629]  They're talking about, you know, how they're going to use executive order to, you know, get the refugee thing going, get all the illegals in there.
[04:49:47.929 --> 04:49:48.850]  And then they're talking about
[04:49:49.591 --> 04:49:57.077]  Publicly in the emails, you know, uh, we can just make the margin of this and we can manipulate the polls this way.
[04:49:57.097 --> 04:50:05.704]  Can you imagine how these people are whenever they're, whenever there's nothing on record, but they're, they're insulting each other.
[04:50:05.724 --> 04:50:13.970]  This John Podesta says about Hillary, he, he's admitting that she has brain damage, that she thinks she's on another planet.
[04:50:14.691 --> 04:50:14.931]  I mean,
[04:50:15.785 --> 04:50:17.306]  But it's a crazy conspiracy.
[04:50:17.446 --> 04:50:20.967]  I'm on a planet where I'm queen and everybody bows to me.
[04:50:21.207 --> 04:50:26.449]  I think it's very interesting that these WikiLeaks emails show the true side of Hillary.
[04:50:26.489 --> 04:50:27.670]  They say she's two-faced.
[04:50:28.210 --> 04:50:33.672]  And she's got one side of her is totally different behind the scenes than how she acts in public.
[04:50:33.932 --> 04:50:36.913]  We've always known that, but it's always interesting to see it in the WikiLeaks.
[04:50:36.933 --> 04:50:39.634]  I think someone needs to stage an intervention with this man.
[04:50:39.654 --> 04:50:41.115]  He's a sexist.
[04:50:41.675 --> 04:50:43.216]  Doesn't want to see a woman president.
[04:50:44.130 --> 04:50:48.551]  Well, tell you what, the WikiLeaks and not only that, now we've got Project Veritas.
[04:50:49.847 --> 04:50:51.888]  And it's wide open.
[04:50:52.088 --> 04:50:54.149]  It's election fraud.
[04:50:54.630 --> 04:50:55.790]  This is so funny.
[04:50:55.830 --> 04:50:58.952]  The mainstream media doesn't even realize they're destroying themselves by not covering it.
[04:50:59.332 --> 04:51:04.315]  Because people are coming to us and other outlets to find out this information and see it and get it.
[04:51:04.335 --> 04:51:05.996]  That's why they're the dinosaur media.
[04:51:06.076 --> 04:51:08.397]  And they're dying and they don't even realize they're killing themselves.
[04:51:08.417 --> 04:51:09.918]  They're actually choking themselves right now.
[04:51:09.998 --> 04:51:13.160]  Chris Cuomo is literally doing this and he doesn't even realize it.
[04:51:13.200 --> 04:51:14.040]  He's such a turd.
[04:51:15.561 --> 04:51:17.483]  We were the first to break Project Veritas.
[04:51:17.623 --> 04:51:20.145]  We had them on yesterday, James O'Keefe.
[04:51:21.006 --> 04:51:25.709]  I make a habit of watching the mainstream media, monitoring the mainstream media.
[04:51:26.170 --> 04:51:32.575]  Nothing about Project Veritas on most all the channels except for Fox, but even Fox it was only on Hannity.
[04:51:32.975 --> 04:51:38.800]  And when it comes to WikiLeaks, Fox is reporting on WikiLeaks, but it's not front and center news.
[04:51:39.180 --> 04:51:42.403]  It's usually towards the end and it's not the hard-hitting stuff that we're learning.
[04:51:42.563 --> 04:51:47.025]  It's after we talk about people who have now been discredited say that Trump fondled them.
[04:51:47.265 --> 04:51:48.006]  Yeah, exactly.
[04:51:48.066 --> 04:51:50.066]  When it was actually the other way around, these women were hitting on Trump.
[04:51:50.086 --> 04:51:52.367]  Yeah, Trump leads the headlines, but it's all anti-Trump.
[04:51:52.408 --> 04:51:53.228]  It's bad press.
[04:51:53.568 --> 04:51:56.009]  The lady on the airplane, a guy came out and said, I was on that flight.
[04:51:56.469 --> 04:51:57.610]  She was hitting on Trump.
[04:52:00.289 --> 04:52:00.789]  But you know what?
[04:52:00.949 --> 04:52:02.690]  She's got connections to the Democratic Party.
[04:52:03.291 --> 04:52:04.432]  What a freaking surprise.
[04:52:04.512 --> 04:52:07.754]  Are we surprised that these people are going to lie to get Hillary in?
[04:52:08.235 --> 04:52:11.137]  They don't care about truth, honor, anything like that.
[04:52:11.157 --> 04:52:16.541]  They just want their woman in the office and they run around with their clenched fists and their anger inside.
[04:52:16.681 --> 04:52:19.223]  Are you surprised that there's an October surprise?
[04:52:19.684 --> 04:52:19.924]  Yeah.
[04:52:20.585 --> 04:52:20.785]  All right.
[04:52:20.805 --> 04:52:21.725]  Thanks for calling, Garrett.
[04:52:21.745 --> 04:52:22.346]  Appreciate it.
[04:52:23.046 --> 04:52:24.408]  Let's go to JD in Mississippi.
[04:52:24.428 --> 04:52:25.328]  He wants to talk about Haiti.
[04:52:25.588 --> 04:52:26.169]  Go ahead, JD.
[04:52:26.189 --> 04:52:27.850]  What's up, guys?
[04:52:29.505 --> 04:52:31.105]  I got a couple of things I want to talk about.
[04:52:31.145 --> 04:52:31.906]  I'm fired up.
[04:52:32.226 --> 04:52:34.006]  Yeah, me too.
[04:52:34.386 --> 04:52:35.346]  That Brexit thing.
[04:52:35.406 --> 04:52:40.428]  People don't realize the same pollsters do that and are doing our election.
[04:52:41.068 --> 04:52:45.349]  And also, you know, nobody's paying no attention to Russia right now.
[04:52:45.489 --> 04:52:48.109]  I mean, I know y'all are, but nobody else is.
[04:52:48.430 --> 04:52:51.310]  And this is an absolute serious situation.
[04:52:51.790 --> 04:52:54.151]  I mean, my hair is growing an inch an hour.
[04:52:54.727 --> 04:52:56.048]  Yeah.
[04:52:56.068 --> 04:53:00.990]  Well, I'd like to see some people from Anchorage, Alaska call us, or from Wasilla.
[04:53:01.571 --> 04:53:03.312]  You know, there was something about Wasilla.
[04:53:03.372 --> 04:53:08.334]  I think they had some, a few, it was like five or six years ago, they closed it off and had some weird exercise there.
[04:53:09.275 --> 04:53:11.536]  And I wonder, do you remember that?
[04:53:11.556 --> 04:53:20.221]  Yeah, I do, and do you remember also that they were wanting to pull back one of the airborne mountain divisions in that area?
[04:53:20.666 --> 04:53:20.746]  Yeah.
[04:53:43.430 --> 04:53:46.151]  You know, a bunch of stuff about Alaska is kind of weird.
[04:54:04.660 --> 04:54:15.426]  Saying that she's not afraid to go toe-to-toe with Putin, and then if there is some kind of hack, or if they, you know, if they hack our servers, that they will strike militarily.
[04:54:15.526 --> 04:54:17.347]  She is prepared to strike militarily.
[04:54:17.688 --> 04:54:21.010]  Meanwhile, then you got Vice President Joe Biden saying that he's going to do it.
[04:54:21.030 --> 04:54:21.790]  We're going to launch a cyber attack.
[04:54:21.810 --> 04:54:22.751]  We're going to launch a cyber attack.
[04:54:22.771 --> 04:54:23.231]  Hopefully not.
[04:54:23.251 --> 04:54:24.091]  This is crazy.
[04:54:24.131 --> 04:54:25.592]  This is very, very careless.
[04:54:26.253 --> 04:54:28.154]  It is.
[04:54:28.294 --> 04:54:32.036]  This is a war between the Democratic Party and Russia.
[04:54:32.478 --> 04:54:38.381]  Not the Republican Party, but except for a few neocons who want to jump in for their glory.
[04:54:38.741 --> 04:54:40.022]  I'm sure John Boehner wants a war.
[04:54:40.042 --> 04:54:41.583]  I think that guy's pro-war.
[04:54:42.683 --> 04:54:44.164]  I'm sure John McCain's pro-war.
[04:54:44.184 --> 04:54:46.265]  I'm sure Paul Ryan's pro-war.
[04:54:46.645 --> 04:54:47.786]  There's plenty of Republicans.
[04:54:47.846 --> 04:54:50.467]  It's not even... Republicans and Democrats are on the same team.
[04:54:50.507 --> 04:54:51.768]  People need to realize that.
[04:54:51.808 --> 04:54:53.588]  Yeah, this is the establishment.
[04:54:53.608 --> 04:54:54.209]  He's outside.
[04:54:54.229 --> 04:54:58.151]  But the Trumpites, let me say the Trumpites, that's a better way of putting it.
[04:54:59.619 --> 04:55:01.260]  Yeah, but hey, it's good talking to you guys.
[04:55:01.520 --> 04:55:02.600]  I want to say hello to Derek.
[04:55:03.900 --> 04:55:04.160]  Yeah.
[04:55:04.260 --> 04:55:06.301]  Hey, J.D., thanks for calling, and I totally agree.
[04:55:06.761 --> 04:55:11.223]  There's not one word in the mainstream media here in the United States about World War III and Russia.
[04:55:11.983 --> 04:55:13.883]  And it's all over the world press.
[04:55:14.104 --> 04:55:14.524]  All over.
[04:55:14.664 --> 04:55:15.284]  All over the place.
[04:55:15.324 --> 04:55:18.045]  We're one of the few places talking about it.
[04:55:18.245 --> 04:55:21.486]  Putin's telling his people to find the nearest bunkers.
[04:55:22.026 --> 04:55:22.886]  It's not even duck and cover.
[04:55:22.926 --> 04:55:23.627]  It's find a bunker.
[04:55:23.847 --> 04:55:27.848]  They'll hear us just say duck and cover, like you're going to make it.
[04:55:29.178 --> 04:55:30.559]  No, he said, find a bunker.
[04:55:30.839 --> 04:55:31.659]  What are they doing for us?
[04:55:31.840 --> 04:55:33.461]  Well, Elite, we got bunkers for the Elites.
[04:55:33.781 --> 04:55:33.881]  Shh!
[04:55:34.341 --> 04:55:35.142]  Don't tell nobody.
[04:55:35.282 --> 04:55:35.482]  Yeah.
[04:55:35.942 --> 04:55:37.403]  But for you, you got nothing.
[04:55:38.083 --> 04:55:41.045]  Because we have enough Elites that we're going to come back and repopulate the planet.
[04:55:42.126 --> 04:55:43.166]  Thanks for calling JD.
[04:55:43.587 --> 04:55:45.468]  Let's go to Daniel in Arizona.
[04:55:47.649 --> 04:55:49.910]  Daniel, were you on Daily Mail yesterday?
[04:55:50.531 --> 04:55:53.292]  Were you the one that crashed the Bernie Sanders rally with a rape t-shirt?
[04:55:53.412 --> 04:55:54.553]  Is that what it says on here?
[04:55:54.653 --> 04:55:54.773]  Yeah.
[04:55:56.849 --> 04:55:58.029]  Good job.
[04:55:58.109 --> 04:56:17.495]  I heard the night before, having accidentally subscribed to them out of one of their email blasts or whatever, Democratic National Committee sent me the invitation to Bernie Sanders rally here in town, and I thought, well, this is my chance.
[04:56:17.995 --> 04:56:25.018]  So I saw you had a button-down shirt on first, so you popped off the button-down shirt and had your rape shirt underneath it.
[04:56:25.098 --> 04:56:26.098]  I did, like a Joe Biggs.
[04:56:26.829 --> 04:56:29.312]  Yeah, it was a makeshift rape shirt.
[04:56:29.352 --> 04:56:33.657]  What I did is I got the image, blew it up, printed it out, because I only had a day.
[04:56:34.138 --> 04:56:41.266]  Printed it out at Office Depot, and I had my friends sew it onto the shirt, and I wrote rape on the bottom of it with a marker.
[04:56:41.286 --> 04:56:44.630]  So I couldn't get in obviously with that.
[04:56:44.670 --> 04:56:46.032]  I got in with a Hillary hat and
[04:56:46.391 --> 04:56:47.451]  Right, right.
[04:56:48.972 --> 04:56:51.973]  Oh, they say the man in the arena, you can't stop a man that keeps on coming.
[04:56:52.173 --> 04:56:52.573]  That's right.
[04:56:52.733 --> 04:56:53.014]  You know?
[04:56:53.394 --> 04:56:54.674]  And that's what illustrates it.
[04:56:54.694 --> 04:56:56.655]  You didn't go, well, I don't have a shirt.
[04:56:56.675 --> 04:56:58.376]  I can't do it.
[04:56:58.576 --> 04:56:59.416]  You went out and made a shirt.
[04:56:59.436 --> 04:57:00.256]  You actually got the image.
[04:57:00.556 --> 04:57:05.458]  You know, some people painted it on themselves.
[04:57:05.598 --> 04:57:07.319]  When I first got there, it was closed.
[04:57:07.339 --> 04:57:08.579]  The doors were closed.
[04:57:08.620 --> 04:57:10.100]  They said no one else was getting in.
[04:57:10.520 --> 04:57:12.041]  There were like 200 people outside.
[04:57:12.121 --> 04:57:15.062]  I mean, probably at the most there were 200 people outside at one point.
[04:57:15.974 --> 04:57:18.475]  Um, and I was kind of just like, I am not going home.
[04:57:18.495 --> 04:57:20.895]  I already invested too much in this.
[04:57:20.955 --> 04:57:24.536]  I went to Walmart, got a camera and everything, you know, a video camera.
[04:57:25.377 --> 04:57:29.498]  And, uh, I was like, I don't care what, I don't care how I'm going to get this job done.
[04:57:30.098 --> 04:57:32.279]  So I stood outside the door where the media was.
[04:57:32.359 --> 04:57:33.299]  I kept on trying to get in there.
[04:57:33.319 --> 04:57:35.559]  I said, what do I have to do to be qualified as media though?
[04:57:35.780 --> 04:57:36.980]  We're not letting anybody else in.
[04:57:37.280 --> 04:57:37.680]  They were all right.
[04:57:37.820 --> 04:57:43.122]  So eventually some people were coming out and I saw that they, like, one of them gave somebody a ticket or something.
[04:57:43.142 --> 04:57:44.422]  And I was like, what are these tickets from?
[04:57:44.912 --> 04:57:46.213]  You had to be here earlier in the day.
[04:57:47.114 --> 04:57:48.374]  Okay, so I saw somebody else come by.
[04:57:48.415 --> 04:57:49.355]  I said, hey, can I have your ticket?
[04:57:49.795 --> 04:57:52.457]  So I got the ticket from that person, and I went and gave it to the door guy.
[04:57:52.477 --> 04:57:55.059]  He let me in, which was a disaster for him.
[04:57:55.079 --> 04:58:01.484]  And, you know, I snaked my way slowly, little by little, towards the front.
[04:58:02.485 --> 04:58:06.247]  This guy had his eyes on me, so I didn't want to go all the way in the front.
[04:58:06.287 --> 04:58:12.712]  But, yeah, I got to, like, the second row, towards the first row, and, yeah, eventually,
[04:58:13.266 --> 04:58:18.308]  I knew that the time was winding down because he had already gone outside and given his speech that he was going to give inside.
[04:58:18.328 --> 04:58:19.088]  He gave it outside.
[04:58:19.568 --> 04:58:20.809]  Oh wow.
[04:58:20.989 --> 04:58:23.210]  I kind of knew where he was in his speech.
[04:58:23.230 --> 04:58:24.950]  I was like, I have to go.
[04:58:24.970 --> 04:58:26.151]  I have to be now.
[04:58:26.171 --> 04:58:27.811]  I'm not going to lose this chance.
[04:58:28.091 --> 04:58:29.352]  I bet you were nervous.
[04:58:29.372 --> 04:58:30.652]  The guy immediately came.
[04:58:30.672 --> 04:58:31.312]  Huh?
[04:58:31.793 --> 04:58:32.653]  Were you a little bit nervous?
[04:58:34.554 --> 04:58:36.574]  I mean, I didn't let it get the best of me.
[04:58:36.974 --> 04:58:38.015]  Of course I was a little bit nervous.
[04:58:38.860 --> 04:58:39.421]  I don't think so.
[04:58:51.938 --> 04:58:54.179]  I felt like, you know what, I'm going to have to betray these people.
[04:58:54.639 --> 04:58:57.741]  Did anybody like physically accost you or attack you?
[04:58:58.121 --> 04:58:58.321]  Yeah.
[04:58:58.341 --> 04:58:58.822]  Yeah.
[04:58:58.842 --> 04:59:00.823]  Well, no, I got spit on when I was outside.
[04:59:00.843 --> 04:59:02.183]  Oh, I didn't.
[04:59:02.603 --> 04:59:03.664]  They love to do that.
[04:59:03.684 --> 04:59:04.104]  Yeah.
[04:59:04.344 --> 04:59:08.907]  The mistake he made was that he spit on the police officer too because the police officer was talking to me.
[04:59:09.347 --> 04:59:12.148]  He immediately, he immediately got caught.
[04:59:12.949 --> 04:59:13.369]  Wow.
[04:59:13.429 --> 04:59:13.569]  Yeah.
[04:59:14.249 --> 04:59:15.932]  Yeah, it was awesome.
[04:59:15.972 --> 04:59:19.578]  I was doing the can-can while the guy was forcing me out up the aisle.
[04:59:19.718 --> 04:59:23.124]  I was doing the can-can and like, you know, screaming Bill Clinton.
[04:59:23.464 --> 04:59:24.506]  So where's the video?
[04:59:24.526 --> 04:59:26.008]  What's the title of this video on YouTube?
[04:59:26.028 --> 04:59:26.790]  Did you put it on YouTube?
[04:59:27.282 --> 04:59:32.308]  I have it unlisted on my channel.
[04:59:32.448 --> 04:59:40.037]  I'm a little conflicted between what I normally engage in and this activity.
[04:59:40.057 --> 04:59:44.843]  I read the Bible because it's really difficult to understand.
[04:59:44.903 --> 04:59:45.764]  I study and everything.
[04:59:46.565 --> 04:59:47.706]  Hey, hey, you know what?
[04:59:47.726 --> 04:59:53.531]  You know what was uncharacteristic of Christ when he went into the money changers area and started whippin' the bankers?
[04:59:53.551 --> 04:59:54.752]  Started whippin' the money?
[04:59:54.772 --> 04:59:56.673]  That was uncharacteristic of Christ to do that.
[04:59:56.953 --> 04:59:59.215]  But he went in and did it because it needed to be done, right?
[05:00:00.556 --> 05:00:07.922]  Yeah, that was one of the things I said to myself was that, well, what if somebody knew that Hitler was going to rise to power?
[05:00:08.042 --> 05:00:11.164]  If they would have done something to stop him, it would have been positive.
[05:00:11.665 --> 05:00:11.885]  Right.
[05:00:11.985 --> 05:00:15.608]  I mean, this is Hitler times 5,000 or something, you know?
[05:00:16.397 --> 05:00:19.378]  Yeah, Hillary Clinton will be bringing in the most corrupt.
[05:00:19.478 --> 05:00:24.961]  I mean, this would be the most corrupt administration in history.
[05:00:25.061 --> 05:00:26.602]  And we know beforehand this time.
[05:00:26.782 --> 05:00:29.623]  Normally we find out like during or afterwards.
[05:00:30.123 --> 05:00:32.444]  We know before she even gets in there.
[05:00:32.664 --> 05:00:33.925]  We know what to expect from her.
[05:00:34.525 --> 05:00:37.166]  So I tell people, why even vote for her?
[05:00:37.206 --> 05:00:40.668]  She might even get impeached as soon as she gets in the White House.
[05:00:40.968 --> 05:00:42.729]  You know, they could start impeachment proceedings.
[05:00:43.530 --> 05:00:50.506]  Like you're always saying, it's not about Hillary per se, it's about this entire system that they've been heralding now for decades.
[05:00:50.546 --> 05:00:52.631]  Yeah, she's the establishment puppet candidate.
[05:00:53.686 --> 05:00:55.887]  Yeah, it doesn't matter about her.
[05:00:56.007 --> 05:00:58.648]  It matters what they're trying to do with her or without her.
[05:00:58.748 --> 05:01:01.169]  But they certainly don't want Donald Trump in there.
[05:01:01.790 --> 05:01:02.750]  And I'll say this.
[05:01:03.070 --> 05:01:08.513]  Trump is by no means perfect, but he opens the door for other outsiders to come in.
[05:01:09.113 --> 05:01:10.974]  He's going to open the door for other outsiders.
[05:01:11.274 --> 05:01:14.295]  Because if you put Hillary in, people are going to go, you know what?
[05:01:15.496 --> 05:01:19.298]  Even a billionaire who spends a lot of his fortune can't even get in.
[05:01:19.338 --> 05:01:20.478]  There's no hope for anybody.
[05:01:22.423 --> 05:01:25.244]  Jill Stein, the Jill Steins of the world will never have a hope.
[05:01:26.224 --> 05:01:36.488]  Gary Johnson, it's not that I'm for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein, but both of them have some interesting ideas that need to be brought up in the American discourse, and they've been shut out.
[05:01:36.548 --> 05:01:38.449]  We have to have more than two parties to vote for.
[05:01:38.469 --> 05:01:39.410]  That's right.
[05:01:39.430 --> 05:01:41.290]  And it all starts with getting an outsider in.
[05:01:41.630 --> 05:01:47.893]  If you let Hillary Clinton get in, you're going to have the same two parties for the next hundred years, and it'll never change unless there's a nuclear war.
[05:01:49.096 --> 05:01:59.287]  And meanwhile the mainstream media, like I said I watched the news a lot last night, that they're totally attacking Trump right now for daring to say that the elections might be rigged.
[05:01:59.668 --> 05:01:59.868]  Yeah.
[05:02:00.108 --> 05:02:03.452]  You know, how dare you undermine our electoral process.
[05:02:03.472 --> 05:02:07.416]  How dare you get our Democratic operatives on tape saying we're rigging the frickin election.
[05:02:07.436 --> 05:02:09.098]  And it's right there on tape, I know.
[05:02:09.378 --> 05:02:10.478]  At the same day.
[05:02:11.158 --> 05:02:13.779]  So that's the latest talking points is Donald Trump.
[05:02:13.799 --> 05:02:19.320]  They almost make him seem unpatriotic by insinuating that there could be election fraud.
[05:02:19.440 --> 05:02:21.101]  Because the Republicans are in on it too.
[05:02:21.141 --> 05:02:22.981]  And the Republicans are saying the same thing.
[05:02:23.021 --> 05:02:29.863]  The same Republican establishment that spent zero dollars on Trump campaign ads.
[05:02:30.063 --> 05:02:33.625]  You know, I've talked to people who are involved in the process in Wisconsin.
[05:02:33.685 --> 05:02:35.306]  It's a big Republican stronghold.
[05:02:35.906 --> 05:02:36.807]  Except in Madison.
[05:02:37.067 --> 05:02:38.708]  I publish it as public now.
[05:02:39.208 --> 05:02:41.990]  Oh, good.
[05:02:43.010 --> 05:02:44.311]  Look for that video.
[05:02:44.511 --> 05:02:45.892]  What's the title of your video?
[05:02:45.932 --> 05:02:46.232]  Hold on.
[05:02:46.592 --> 05:02:47.092]  We'll pull it up.
[05:02:47.393 --> 05:02:51.555]  Sanders' apostrophe flagstaff rally crashed.
[05:02:52.657 --> 05:02:52.777]  Yeah.
[05:03:09.708 --> 05:03:13.390]  I don't know if we've hit the limit yet.
[05:03:13.470 --> 05:03:16.151]  I was talking to a guy today on the phone trying to get him on.
[05:03:16.191 --> 05:03:19.613]  He crashed one in Ohio and I think he crashed an Obama rally.
[05:03:38.715 --> 05:03:41.417]  There's so many here at the last three or four days.
[05:03:41.457 --> 05:03:44.139]  They're trying to go through and figure out when they actually did it.
[05:03:44.259 --> 05:03:47.862]  I know the guy's working on the contest because we're running out of funds to do this.
[05:03:48.282 --> 05:03:51.885]  I think we should just start a Kickstarter and have other people throw in money.
[05:03:51.925 --> 05:03:54.687]  And as we get that, and just say, if you do it, you get a thousand bucks.
[05:03:54.928 --> 05:03:56.149]  You get a thousand bucks that way.
[05:03:56.169 --> 05:03:56.249]  Yeah.
[05:03:56.789 --> 05:04:01.132]  Cause it, you know, nobody really followed the rules to the T except maybe the first guy.
[05:04:01.152 --> 05:04:03.054]  And I don't know if he ever came forward to claim the prize money.
[05:04:03.154 --> 05:04:03.794]  I don't even know that.
[05:04:05.675 --> 05:04:06.855]  So that's interesting there.
[05:04:07.156 --> 05:04:10.857]  But we'll pull up your video in a second when we find it and give out the title again.
[05:04:10.877 --> 05:04:11.757]  What's the name of your channel?
[05:04:13.638 --> 05:04:18.220]  Well, my channel is my own name, Daniel Bilodeau.
[05:04:19.440 --> 05:04:23.722]  And if you go to YouTube.com, actually, if you check your Twitter, I had already given you the link.
[05:04:25.465 --> 05:04:28.606]  I don't have my phone with me and I don't know if they have my Twitter pulled up.
[05:04:28.666 --> 05:04:30.027]  You probably did.
[05:04:30.747 --> 05:04:31.647]  Give me the title again.
[05:04:32.048 --> 05:04:32.568]  Go ahead.
[05:04:32.928 --> 05:04:36.049]  Sanders Flagstaff Rally crashed.
[05:04:38.290 --> 05:04:39.530]  Sanders Rally crashed.
[05:04:40.571 --> 05:04:42.291]  Sanders Flagstaff Rally crashed.
[05:04:42.311 --> 05:04:42.972]  Flagstaff.
[05:04:43.112 --> 05:04:44.972]  Sanders Flagstaff Rally crashed.
[05:04:45.233 --> 05:04:45.973]  Look for that guys.
[05:04:45.993 --> 05:04:47.874]  It just came up for me.
[05:04:47.894 --> 05:04:51.035]  In the search results it came up.
[05:04:53.726 --> 05:04:54.466]  Oh, I'm sure it'll come up.
[05:04:54.726 --> 05:04:55.947]  Hey, Daniel, thanks for calling.
[05:04:55.967 --> 05:04:58.548]  Appreciate all your hard work, buddy.
[05:04:58.888 --> 05:04:59.528]  There you go.
[05:04:59.708 --> 05:05:00.509]  Because you know what?
[05:05:00.549 --> 05:05:01.289]  People heard it go.
[05:05:01.329 --> 05:05:01.969]  Let's watch it.
[05:05:02.289 --> 05:05:03.750]  This stuff is viral, man.
[05:05:03.770 --> 05:05:04.590]  It's got 92 now, buddy.
[05:05:04.911 --> 05:05:05.191]  It's got 92.
[05:05:05.291 --> 05:05:06.291]  It's going to go viral.
[05:05:06.891 --> 05:05:07.151]  Don't worry.
[05:05:07.171 --> 05:05:09.172]  Because people are craving this information.
[05:05:17.420 --> 05:05:17.680]  Yeah.
[05:05:17.780 --> 05:05:19.201]  And we'll add it with our others too.
[05:05:19.221 --> 05:05:20.281]  So we're going to add it with our other videos.
[05:05:20.301 --> 05:05:20.981]  So go to about two minutes.
[05:05:21.021 --> 05:05:22.921]  He said there's an annotation that takes you forward.
[05:05:23.321 --> 05:05:24.562]  Two minutes and 50 seconds, you said?
[05:05:24.582 --> 05:05:26.522]  About there.
[05:05:26.542 --> 05:05:27.562]  About there, yeah.
[05:05:27.762 --> 05:05:28.082]  Yeah.
[05:05:28.502 --> 05:05:29.223]  Roll it up forward.
[05:05:29.243 --> 05:05:30.003]  There you go.
[05:05:30.103 --> 05:05:32.423]  And then I have three annotations.
[05:05:32.503 --> 05:05:33.664]  That one that you mentioned.
[05:05:33.964 --> 05:05:34.224]  Yeah.
[05:05:34.244 --> 05:05:38.825]  The one that leads to the mainstream media coverage.
[05:05:38.865 --> 05:05:43.446]  It leads you to the exact point, which is like 35 minutes and five seconds into that video.
[05:05:43.846 --> 05:05:44.666]  And then another one
[05:05:45.609 --> 05:05:46.949]  Look at these millennials, they're like, oh!
[05:05:47.330 --> 05:05:47.550]  Oh!
[05:05:48.190 --> 05:05:52.231]  Oh no, listen, I felt so sorry for them, because they were thunderstruck.
[05:05:52.571 --> 05:05:56.232]  They came outside and they were just like, I guess this is happening to me.
[05:05:56.253 --> 05:05:57.473]  They couldn't say anything.
[05:05:57.813 --> 05:06:01.014]  Somebody's talking about our beloved Bernie, the man who would give us free.
[05:06:01.654 --> 05:06:03.595]  Don't feel too bad for him.
[05:06:03.695 --> 05:06:08.817]  How come Bernie is backing Hillary after she stole the frickin' nomination from him?
[05:06:09.077 --> 05:06:12.858]  Well, let's just say his most ethical point
[05:06:13.399 --> 05:06:28.111]  Has to do with opposing the top 10th percentile of the 1 percentile and whatever, and yet he's backing the one candidate who's getting all of their money to answer the question, well how... You're back at square one, aren't you?
[05:06:28.131 --> 05:06:28.671]  Yeah.
[05:06:30.032 --> 05:06:34.833]  She's funded by the .1% and he's there taking it in.
[05:06:34.873 --> 05:06:37.854]  Well, I think that was part of that $600,000 house deal that he got.
[05:06:38.174 --> 05:06:38.954]  But I don't know.
[05:06:39.034 --> 05:06:40.075]  That's none of my business.
[05:06:40.755 --> 05:06:42.055]  I drink the tea like Kermit.
[05:06:42.235 --> 05:06:43.035]  Hey, thanks for calling, Daniel.
[05:06:43.055 --> 05:06:43.475]  We gotta run.
[05:06:43.495 --> 05:06:44.416]  We got a bunch more callers.
[05:06:44.516 --> 05:06:46.096]  I think he got death threats, personally.
[05:06:46.116 --> 05:06:47.036]  Yeah, I'm sure he did.
[05:06:47.917 --> 05:06:48.857]  Adam from Florida.
[05:06:49.457 --> 05:06:50.057]  Go ahead, Trump.
[05:06:50.077 --> 05:06:51.597]  Stand on posse commentatus.
[05:06:52.518 --> 05:06:55.398]  Yeah, posse commentatus.
[05:06:55.839 --> 05:06:57.439]  That's putting the military on the streets, right?
[05:06:59.164 --> 05:07:01.745]  I thought that was when somebody robbed a bank to go after him.
[05:07:18.892 --> 05:07:21.774]  Yeah, and it has a little section there on Posse Comensatus.
[05:07:21.794 --> 05:07:30.899]  You got 25% off Brain Force, Living Defense is back in stock, and Hillary for Prison t-shirts are at cost.
[05:07:30.979 --> 05:07:31.719]  Oh yeah, I'm getting to that.
[05:07:31.939 --> 05:07:32.900]  Until they're discontinued.
[05:07:32.920 --> 05:07:34.181]  This is the last version we're running.
[05:07:35.000 --> 05:07:35.220]  I don't
[05:07:55.726 --> 05:07:57.467]  I think that was about it.
[05:08:24.508 --> 05:08:28.190]  Hey brother, keep being strong, talk to your people in Florida, get them to vote for Trump.
[05:08:28.910 --> 05:08:30.011]  Or vote for Jill Stein.
[05:08:30.251 --> 05:08:31.652]  But not for Hillary.
[05:08:32.492 --> 05:08:34.333]  Whatever we do, don't vote for Hillary.
[05:08:34.433 --> 05:08:36.454]  Oh my god, that would be a total nightmare.
[05:08:36.474 --> 05:08:39.216]  Can you imagine Hillary Clinton as your president?
[05:08:39.236 --> 05:08:40.917]  I'm trying not to think about it, but you know.
[05:08:40.937 --> 05:08:42.537]  What's gonna happen to Infowars?
[05:08:42.637 --> 05:08:43.858]  What's gonna happen to Infowars?
[05:08:45.819 --> 05:08:49.660]  We'll blow up even bigger because it's just going to be continuation of the lives of the mainstream media.
[05:08:49.920 --> 05:08:52.821]  They're already protecting her now because they're afraid she's going to be president.
[05:08:53.061 --> 05:08:57.463]  Instead of just coming out and showing how she's a criminal, and then she won't be president.
[05:08:57.903 --> 05:08:58.783]  But you're right.
[05:08:58.803 --> 05:09:01.184]  A lot of the mainstream media, you're absolutely right.
[05:09:01.204 --> 05:09:05.185]  They're afraid to attack her, especially because she's this close to becoming president.
[05:09:05.226 --> 05:09:06.846]  They already know how corrupt she is.
[05:09:07.226 --> 05:09:12.448]  Imagine how corrupt and how dangerous Hillary Clinton will be once she's sitting in the Oval Office.
[05:09:13.348 --> 05:09:13.868]  Exactly.
[05:09:14.589 --> 05:09:19.171]  Terry in Minnesota wants to talk about a Trump presidency, the new world order, and Haiti.
[05:09:19.291 --> 05:09:20.371]  Go ahead, Terry.
[05:09:21.471 --> 05:09:22.732]  Hey, how are you today?
[05:09:23.232 --> 05:09:23.632]  Doing great.
[05:09:23.652 --> 05:09:24.233]  Fantastic.
[05:09:25.053 --> 05:09:29.194]  I talked to Rob back in June, Rob, when you guys were doing the primaries.
[05:09:30.115 --> 05:09:31.856]  I think a few of you were sitting behind there.
[05:09:32.336 --> 05:09:35.397]  Anyway, I was listening to Gary Haven and Alex today.
[05:09:35.417 --> 05:09:40.659]  He's talking about, you know, Satan and the whole nine yards, what's going down at the Biblical, blah, blah, blah.
[05:09:41.458 --> 05:09:44.280]  It's absolutely biblical, and he brought up the remnant.
[05:09:44.560 --> 05:09:48.942]  The remnant, basically, are those that God passed the truth down to.
[05:09:48.982 --> 05:09:58.188]  The elect, which are right around today, are the ones that are going to stand against this whole thing, you know, and I know the reason... I mean, I saw you guys in January.
[05:09:58.208 --> 05:10:09.354]  One of the reasons I hung in there, because I think one of the early reports I heard Alex do was on that whole rapture thing, which is basically a big lie, you know, and it's perpetrated basically everywhere.
[05:10:10.095 --> 05:10:14.917]  Uh, and you know, you've got, you got free will, which is so powerful.
[05:10:15.057 --> 05:10:16.597]  It's, it's, you know, people don't understand it.
[05:10:16.617 --> 05:10:19.398]  They want to blame everybody else, but it really comes down to the individual.
[05:10:19.458 --> 05:10:27.141]  But, um, when I heard, uh, my daughter and I, we heard Trump, you know, you know, um, we knew instantly he was going to be president, uh, a hundred percent.
[05:10:27.761 --> 05:10:31.462]  Um, I told this Alex, he wasn't quite on board, like maybe three months ago.
[05:10:31.982 --> 05:10:39.265]  I said, the reason why Trump's going to make it, and he's going to be there cause just like Obama, just like everything that's gone down politically, educationally,
[05:10:39.818 --> 05:10:40.118]  Equally.
[05:10:40.238 --> 05:10:41.099]  It treats you as an equal.
[05:10:41.119 --> 05:10:42.820]  What you put into it, you get out of it.
[05:11:08.105 --> 05:11:13.590]  Well, so when they crash the economy, that's going to force the powers to be basically to get to the table.
[05:11:14.371 --> 05:11:18.974]  You're deadly ruin isn't to an individual, it's basically to the one world system.
[05:11:18.994 --> 05:11:28.862]  So you have to have all the countries on board and everybody's got to be on board for the one world system to solidify, but it's not going to solidify until actually Satan shows up and that's the deal, you know?
[05:11:29.323 --> 05:11:33.666]  It's just like, um, you know, I really feel bad for a lot of the guys.
[05:11:33.947 --> 05:11:36.569]  Um, I'm not sure, uh, on your crew, but um,
[05:11:37.543 --> 05:11:40.424]  You know, when you go to Revelation, a lot of people think it's a closed book.
[05:11:40.464 --> 05:11:41.164]  It's not a closed book.
[05:11:41.184 --> 05:11:43.985]  That's why God named it Revelation, means to be real or uncovered.
[05:11:44.665 --> 05:11:46.585]  I also told Alex about the Shepherd's Chapel.
[05:11:46.685 --> 05:11:49.426]  It's the largest non-denominational church on the face of the earth.
[05:11:49.546 --> 05:11:51.886]  It is the max info wars of churches.
[05:11:52.827 --> 05:11:55.327]  You can get up to speed in pretty darn quick.
[05:11:55.447 --> 05:12:06.530]  It's, you know, the scholar there is probably the best scholar to walk the earth in the last hundred years, but it doesn't leave anything wanting, because it's taught from the Word, not from the man, not from seminaries, not from all this stuff.
[05:12:06.946 --> 05:12:09.869]  What's happening is that's really what Alex and Gary were talking about.
[05:12:09.889 --> 05:12:12.731]  You know, we're way past centuries and decades.
[05:12:12.751 --> 05:12:14.593]  We're down to months, my friend.
[05:12:15.113 --> 05:12:15.454]  You know?
[05:12:15.694 --> 05:12:18.396]  So Hillary isn't going to make it because she doesn't fit the bill.
[05:12:19.357 --> 05:12:25.683]  You've got to have somebody that's willing to pull out of Russia, China, and walk away from the table, which Trump openly says he's going to do.
[05:12:25.703 --> 05:12:30.768]  And he will, because if he was selected like Alex... Here's a side note.
[05:12:30.908 --> 05:12:32.169]  Alex basically is a Paul.
[05:12:32.631 --> 05:12:49.419]  He's got the knowledge, he knows what's going on, but like Paul, before the conversion, before the conversion, um, he basically, uh, um, you know, without their, you know, persecuting Christians are the new religion, you know, until God knocked his butt down on the border of Damascus, basically.
[05:12:50.019 --> 05:12:54.781]  And he had three days as he blinded him to think about scripture, to think about everything that's going on in his time.
[05:12:54.801 --> 05:12:55.761]  You know what I'm saying?
[05:12:56.262 --> 05:12:58.883]  So it's like, Alex is exactly the same position.
[05:12:58.923 --> 05:13:00.183]  He's just not quite there yet.
[05:13:00.283 --> 05:13:01.444]  I know Gary Haven, he's,
[05:13:02.006 --> 05:13:11.991]  Everyone's like edgy and everyone knows, but they can't quite put their finger on it, and that's why the elect... Man, if you ever get a chance to do the elect, talk to anybody that's one of the guys that's elected.
[05:13:12.031 --> 05:13:14.192]  Only 7,000 of the hardcore, as I call them.
[05:13:14.492 --> 05:13:18.274]  Well, I mean, it's easy to judge people from different positions, but I'll tell you this.
[05:13:18.414 --> 05:13:22.876]  Alex gets up every day and goes after the people that are controlling things.
[05:13:22.896 --> 05:13:23.197]  No, no, no.
[05:13:23.337 --> 05:13:24.257]  I'm not judging Alex.
[05:13:24.297 --> 05:13:25.518]  He's a fantastic guy.
[05:13:26.303 --> 05:13:31.106]  God chose Alex to be born into this last generation like everybody else, okay?
[05:13:31.166 --> 05:13:32.567]  And he wouldn't have it any other way.
[05:13:32.827 --> 05:13:33.768]  He loves what he's doing.
[05:13:33.988 --> 05:13:34.808]  No, no, no, no.
[05:13:34.848 --> 05:13:36.129]  I mean, Alex could pack it up.
[05:13:36.189 --> 05:13:39.971]  He could shut everything down, live comfortably, just go up in the hills.
[05:13:40.632 --> 05:13:50.198]  No, it's... Alex, with you, this is not, no, this is, you know, God bless you, Alex's entire family, you guys, your two-year family, all your audience, this is not what that's about.
[05:13:50.218 --> 05:13:51.838]  666, Satan's number, Hollywood knows it.
[05:13:51.919 --> 05:13:54.100]  I mean, they're full of K9s, but those are Satan's kids.
[05:13:54.740 --> 05:13:55.901]  Alex calls the globalists.
[05:13:56.811 --> 05:13:58.832]  No, those are Satan's children.
[05:13:58.872 --> 05:14:00.113]  That's absolute Scripture.
[05:14:00.153 --> 05:14:02.694]  If you understand Scripture, that is what's going on down here.
[05:14:02.714 --> 05:14:04.575]  That's why they control everything.
[05:14:04.896 --> 05:14:05.656]  God allows it.
[05:14:05.676 --> 05:14:10.099]  You know, there's a big old pop quiz that Father's going to put on the kids, all of us.
[05:14:10.699 --> 05:14:11.499]  Who comes first?
[05:14:11.940 --> 05:14:13.380]  Is it Jesus Christ or is it Satan?
[05:14:13.400 --> 05:14:15.321]  You know, Satan comes disguised as Jesus Christ.
[05:14:15.341 --> 05:14:17.282]  The world's going to go goo-goo-ga-ga after this guy.
[05:14:17.583 --> 05:14:21.145]  Because most of the world, I'm not saying they don't love the Lord.
[05:14:21.165 --> 05:14:22.986]  Billions love the Lord, but
[05:14:24.232 --> 05:14:35.459]  Because of the religious, because of Satan's infiltrated everything, Scripture's not taught the way it was supposed to be, so God's thought, from God to the individual's mind, isn't brought forth.
[05:14:35.539 --> 05:14:36.380]  It's out of context.
[05:14:36.460 --> 05:14:45.246]  It's this, it's that, and everything else, and Satan's got a fantastic job of messing up the minds of people, and the deception, which is, we're past our eyebrows in deception,
[05:14:46.026 --> 05:14:47.507]  Everything, you guys are bombarded.
[05:14:47.547 --> 05:14:50.869]  We're bombarded every single day with every new thing under the sun.
[05:14:51.149 --> 05:14:53.670]  It's all designed to keep you away from actual truth.
[05:14:53.690 --> 05:14:54.831]  You know what I'm saying?
[05:14:54.911 --> 05:14:55.591]  I hear you Terry.
[05:14:55.611 --> 05:14:57.352]  Hey Terry, thanks for calling.
[05:14:58.332 --> 05:15:01.474]  That was quite an interesting caller there.
[05:15:01.514 --> 05:15:02.794]  He really had a lot to say.
[05:15:03.335 --> 05:15:04.035]  Didn't take a breath.
[05:15:04.195 --> 05:15:11.819]  It reminds me, I saw Trump just a few days ago and he was a largely Christian audience and he says, please pray for me.
[05:15:12.119 --> 05:15:12.319]  Yeah.
[05:15:12.459 --> 05:15:12.659]  Right.
[05:15:12.759 --> 05:15:14.040]  And he says, I pray for you.
[05:15:14.500 --> 05:15:22.143]  And I thought it was really interesting where he said, I think that the only way, perhaps my only way to get to heaven is if I become president.
[05:15:22.383 --> 05:15:22.603]  Right.
[05:15:22.943 --> 05:15:23.623]  And he said that.
[05:15:24.023 --> 05:15:25.524]  And that shows you his intentions.
[05:15:26.618 --> 05:15:32.041]  You know, he didn't have a perfect past, but he really, really wants to get in there and do good for us all.
[05:15:32.061 --> 05:15:34.622]  Alright, I got Kevin from West Virginia.
[05:15:34.722 --> 05:15:42.646]  Kevin, if you start holding a sermon here on the air, I'm going to cut you off because our last guy went five minutes without breathing.
[05:15:44.227 --> 05:15:45.428]  But I agree with what you say.
[05:15:45.448 --> 05:15:46.688]  It's a political answer.
[05:15:46.708 --> 05:15:47.048]  Hold on.
[05:15:47.188 --> 05:15:48.809]  Political answer to a spiritual problem.
[05:15:48.829 --> 05:15:49.509]  Oh, did he go?
[05:15:49.529 --> 05:15:50.349]  I guess he hung up.
[05:15:50.790 --> 05:15:52.210]  Maybe he was going to talk for more than five minutes.
[05:15:52.270 --> 05:15:54.151]  Maybe he had more than five minutes to say.
[05:15:54.171 --> 05:15:54.991]  He's like, then I'm out.
[05:15:55.131 --> 05:15:59.813]  Guys, the way this works is you make your point and we could have an open discussion about things.
[05:15:59.833 --> 05:16:01.654]  But if you don't let us talk, we're going to cut you off.
[05:16:01.694 --> 05:16:04.395]  You can't just sit there and and then you're going to own the mic.
[05:16:05.175 --> 05:16:06.336]  Sorry, it's not going to happen.
[05:16:07.216 --> 05:16:14.321]  Pontificate is for your YouTube channel that you get on and produce your 16-minute videos, okay?
[05:16:14.762 --> 05:16:16.503]  More power to you, and I love it.
[05:16:16.543 --> 05:16:18.985]  I love this free speech, and I didn't have any problem with what Terry was saying.
[05:16:19.005 --> 05:16:19.725]  No, I was very interested.
[05:16:19.745 --> 05:16:23.748]  But you gotta let us interject and have a conversation or it doesn't work, you know?
[05:16:23.768 --> 05:16:24.609]  That's how it works here.
[05:16:25.630 --> 05:16:27.671]  I got Joe Biggs coming up in a second, too.
[05:16:27.811 --> 05:16:28.452]  You kicking me out?
[05:16:28.632 --> 05:16:29.673]  No, not yet, not yet.
[05:16:30.013 --> 05:16:30.654]  But we've got
[05:16:31.714 --> 05:16:34.395]  He's been in contact with the guy who started doing these independent polls.
[05:16:34.475 --> 05:16:34.736]  I know.
[05:16:35.176 --> 05:16:40.538]  And I can't wait to show you these results of these polls because it's going to prove that the mainstream media is lying.
[05:16:40.578 --> 05:16:46.000]  We got a clip from Larry Nichols from earlier today as well, talking about how the polls are... and he just looks at it.
[05:16:46.020 --> 05:16:48.221]  He goes, I looked at the poll and here's where it's all wrong.
[05:16:48.442 --> 05:16:49.262]  And he goes into it.
[05:16:50.602 --> 05:16:51.243]  Trump is right.
[05:16:51.303 --> 05:16:52.323]  They are rigging the polls.
[05:16:52.403 --> 05:16:56.025]  They're rigging everything because they can't stand to see an outsider in.
[05:16:56.265 --> 05:17:00.167]  That's why... We can't let Hillary in, guys.
[05:17:01.404 --> 05:17:02.506]  You gotta get motivated.
[05:17:02.646 --> 05:17:04.248]  Don't get weak.
[05:17:04.268 --> 05:17:05.309]  There's what, 19 days left?
[05:17:05.329 --> 05:17:06.070]  18 days left?
[05:17:06.430 --> 05:17:07.071]  Till the election.
[05:17:07.091 --> 05:17:08.713]  I think Trump's gonna win.
[05:17:08.733 --> 05:17:09.053]  Three weeks.
[05:17:09.153 --> 05:17:10.055]  Overwhelming victory.
[05:17:10.075 --> 05:17:11.216]  Hold fast, people.
[05:17:11.296 --> 05:17:11.997]  Hold fast.
[05:17:12.057 --> 05:17:12.558]  It's gonna be great.
[05:17:12.578 --> 05:17:12.918]  Trump's gonna win.
[05:17:13.780 --> 05:17:17.302]  Now coming up from 5 to 7, Leanne McAdoo is going to be on for a whole two hours.
[05:17:17.342 --> 05:17:22.245]  She's going to have guests Owen Schroer, Margaret Howe is going to be in there with her.
[05:17:22.285 --> 05:17:25.567]  She's going to be covering some news as well, some breaking news.
[05:17:26.047 --> 05:17:32.791]  Guys, check our YouTube channel, see if we had a little interview with Nigel Farage this morning and we're going to hopefully have a sneak peek of that before
[05:17:33.271 --> 05:17:35.172]  We get out of here at 5 o'clock.
[05:17:35.233 --> 05:17:35.833]  I'm punching out at 5.
[05:17:36.654 --> 05:17:38.975]  And then I'll be back later tonight with our full debate.
[05:17:38.995 --> 05:17:41.277]  And Nigel Farage, he knows a thing or two about polls.
[05:17:41.397 --> 05:17:43.178]  He knows a thing or two about a thing or two, definitely.
[05:17:43.258 --> 05:17:44.319]  And a thing or two about Brexit.
[05:17:44.339 --> 05:17:45.640]  He's the architect of it.
[05:17:46.140 --> 05:17:49.223]  So when we do get that video, don't even tell me we have it.
[05:17:49.283 --> 05:17:51.504]  Just download it and put it in the system so we can play it.
[05:17:51.584 --> 05:17:54.847]  It should be a very short snippet of an interview with Nigel Farage.
[05:17:55.572 --> 05:17:56.772]  Well, you might have to refresh that.
[05:17:57.533 --> 05:17:59.193]  Or call Josh and see where it's at.
[05:18:00.474 --> 05:18:01.474]  But that's going to be coming up.
[05:18:02.234 --> 05:18:03.755]  Let's go back to your calls now.
[05:18:03.835 --> 05:18:06.096]  Let's go to Steve in Florida.
[05:18:06.116 --> 05:18:09.797]  Let's talk about Michael Savage and Larry Nichols' comments on the election forecast.
[05:18:10.317 --> 05:18:10.917]  Go ahead, Steve.
[05:18:11.238 --> 05:18:13.358]  Hey, good afternoon, guys.
[05:18:13.638 --> 05:18:23.702]  You know how many times Alex has said, all of a sudden he had an epiphany and the lights just clicked on about something he'd been looking into but wasn't quite sure about?
[05:18:25.512 --> 05:18:28.573]  Well, I believe I had one of those yesterday.
[05:18:28.593 --> 05:18:33.655]  You know, I've been following what Alex has been saying for the late 90s now.
[05:18:33.675 --> 05:18:45.260]  I actually was into Tex Meyers, who's a good friend of Alex's, is there in Austin, and he's been on board with this whole thing, exposing the New World Order for, you know, years and years and years.
[05:18:46.060 --> 05:18:50.122]  And, you know, I texted an interview with Alex for a
[05:18:50.612 --> 05:18:54.813]  A documentary he did called Night Stalkers Over America that he put out in 1999.
[05:18:55.093 --> 05:18:58.274]  That's how I first found out about Alex.
[05:18:58.714 --> 05:19:08.556]  So I really appreciate what Alex has been doing over the years and staying in the battle and standing up for what's right and exposing all this evil.
[05:19:08.596 --> 05:19:09.536]  But here's the thing.
[05:19:10.296 --> 05:19:13.237]  I've been chomping at the bit to call in and talk about this.
[05:19:13.497 --> 05:19:18.458]  One of my favorite guests that Alex has on, he had on today, and that's Larry Nichols.
[05:19:19.381 --> 05:19:30.403]  Because the man is just so candid and so honest and has such a heart to just want to, you know, do what's right and basically make up for the harm he's done in the past with the Clintons and all that.
[05:19:31.203 --> 05:19:41.765]  And several months ago, I forget how long ago it was, you may remember this, do you remember when he was on with Alex and talking about the election, the campaign and the way it was going?
[05:19:42.505 --> 05:19:48.366]  And he, Alex was asking him what his take was on how he thought, you know, this whole thing was going to go.
[05:19:49.381 --> 05:20:01.644]  And do you remember him saying something about that if Hillary doesn't get in or doesn't become the nominee or something along those lines, then watch for Biden to throw his hat in the ring.
[05:20:01.684 --> 05:20:03.464]  Do you remember him saying that?
[05:20:03.504 --> 05:20:04.165]  Yeah, I do.
[05:20:04.285 --> 05:20:05.025]  I do remember him saying that.
[05:20:05.045 --> 05:20:07.965]  I also remember him saying Hillary's going to play the victim and the underdog.
[05:20:08.366 --> 05:20:10.026]  And that's how she has to play.
[05:20:10.046 --> 05:20:10.926]  But go ahead.
[05:20:11.046 --> 05:20:12.506]  So what's your comment on Joe Biden?
[05:20:13.027 --> 05:20:18.808]  OK, now I want to add into the mix here something that Michael Savage said.
[05:20:19.338 --> 05:20:23.319]  With Alex that really just solidified it for me and gave me this kind of epiphany.
[05:20:23.799 --> 05:20:29.981]  He said if that happens, he said then watch for Obama to stay in.
[05:20:30.741 --> 05:20:36.383]  Now here's the thing, yesterday Michael was talking about that two days ago he had Donald Trump on his show.
[05:20:37.243 --> 05:20:48.546]  And when Michael Savage said this in relation to what the input was he got from Donald Trump, this light just clicked on because I, again, I'm following all the intel.
[05:20:49.076 --> 05:20:56.302]  You guys are putting out, and Drudge and others, but primarily InfoWars, which is factual to the max, because it's documented.
[05:20:56.723 --> 05:20:58.945]  When you guys are wrong, you come out and correct that.
[05:20:59.585 --> 05:21:00.346]  But here's the thing.
[05:21:00.726 --> 05:21:16.240]  Michael Savage said he believes that based on everything, the way it's going, and the desperation of the Clinton camp and the Democrats, and what they're putting forth now about the Russians and anyone that sides with them and, you know, hacking the DNC and all this kind of stuff,
[05:21:16.741 --> 05:21:35.171]  He believes that Trump will be elected, if you remember he said that yesterday, and then he said if that happens, what's going to end up happening is they're going to come out and say the Russians hijacked the whole process, they hacked in, and therefore there's massive voter fraud.
[05:21:35.571 --> 05:21:36.691]  Right.
[05:21:37.052 --> 05:21:39.553]  And so therefore we're going to have to have a recall.
[05:21:40.023 --> 05:21:47.589]  And then Mr. Obama is going to graciously decide to stay in, to oversee everything, to prevent further chaos.
[05:21:48.269 --> 05:21:49.931]  That's what I see coming.
[05:21:50.111 --> 05:21:51.932]  I see where it's not, there won't be.
[05:21:52.032 --> 05:21:57.016]  I've been telling people, I wouldn't be a bit surprised if there's no election.
[05:21:57.156 --> 05:21:59.258]  Well, now I'm changing that.
[05:21:59.838 --> 05:22:02.881]  I wouldn't be a bit surprised if there's no inauguration.
[05:22:03.341 --> 05:22:07.164]  Where it's not Hillary, it's not Trump.
[05:22:07.537 --> 05:22:18.500]  Because remember, Alex, if you remember, behind the scenes he said his intel said that he saw infighting going on between, Larry Nichols talks about this, between Obama and the Clintons.
[05:22:18.920 --> 05:22:28.862]  And I just saw on the cover of the Globe, which I know is a rag, but it said that Obama is secretly calling for Hillary to be destroyed.
[05:22:29.482 --> 05:22:32.323]  I think Obama has got his own agenda.
[05:22:32.343 --> 05:22:36.604]  Remember, Larry Nichols also said if he is in,
[05:22:37.714 --> 05:22:40.899]  He will be declared the king of Islam worldwide.
[05:22:41.220 --> 05:22:48.431]  He was in charge of the UN Security Council and the United States government for a seven month period in his first term.
[05:22:48.952 --> 05:22:52.838]  I think Obama wants to stay in so bad he's going to pull this off.
[05:22:53.348 --> 05:23:00.051]  And then pull the martial law trigger with more false flags with ISIS and what I call backside spatter.
[05:23:00.652 --> 05:23:02.592]  I can see, hold on for a second, hold on for a second, Steve.
[05:23:03.613 --> 05:23:07.435]  I can see how this could happen, especially if Trump wins, then there's massive riots all over.
[05:23:07.775 --> 05:23:13.137]  And Hillary said, and during her campaign, she said, look out, Russians, they might try to hack the election.
[05:23:13.197 --> 05:23:15.619]  Well, yeah, of course, they're going to blame that on there.
[05:23:16.864 --> 05:23:18.364]  The news will be out that Trump won the election.
[05:23:18.384 --> 05:23:22.625]  So you're going to have these riots start taking place, probably in Chicago first, and then another big city.
[05:23:22.645 --> 05:23:23.806]  A lot of them George Soros-funded riots.
[05:23:23.826 --> 05:23:26.066]  There's probably going to be like six different riots across the country.
[05:23:26.366 --> 05:23:27.867]  National Guard's going to be called in.
[05:23:28.187 --> 05:23:31.648]  And then it's going to come out, oh now we have the proof the Russians were hacking it.
[05:23:31.668 --> 05:23:32.928]  Look, we have these files.
[05:23:33.588 --> 05:23:36.589]  And all the proof will be coming from the mainstream media.
[05:23:36.669 --> 05:23:37.089]  Exactly.
[05:23:37.109 --> 05:23:41.210]  They'll be providing the proof, the nonstop analysis of the election results.
[05:23:41.710 --> 05:23:48.076]  And it's going to come back that people were hacking into machines, it was probably Democratic operatives, or even lone wolves.
[05:23:48.556 --> 05:23:48.917]  Who knows?
[05:23:49.337 --> 05:23:51.619]  But the Russians already said they're not going to do it.
[05:23:51.959 --> 05:23:56.383]  And we've seen, we've got it on tape, that the Democrats have admitted that they hacked these elections.
[05:23:56.784 --> 05:23:57.804]  So that's what's going to happen.
[05:23:57.845 --> 05:23:58.745]  Now I want to go to a clip.
[05:23:59.026 --> 05:24:02.028]  McBrain, I've got to kick you out here and put you in Joe Biggs.
[05:24:02.048 --> 05:24:03.209]  We're going to bring in Joe Biggs.
[05:24:03.249 --> 05:24:03.730]  Bring on the Biggs.
[05:24:03.810 --> 05:24:04.691]  Independent polls.
[05:24:05.311 --> 05:24:11.136]  But first, this is a clip from Larry Nichols talking about a specific poll that he looked at today.
[05:24:11.176 --> 05:24:11.997]  Just happened today.
[05:24:12.678 --> 05:24:13.358]  Came out today.
[05:24:13.378 --> 05:24:17.702]  And this poll, he looked at it and goes, look how fake this is.
[05:24:17.742 --> 05:24:18.683]  This is a fake poll.
[05:24:18.923 --> 05:24:27.011]  And this is one way they're trying to control you and manipulate you by showing all these fake polls and all these fake results to make you think that Donald Trump doesn't have a chance to win.
[05:24:27.051 --> 05:24:29.253]  Therefore, you're not going to go out and vote because you don't have a chance anyway.
[05:24:29.813 --> 05:24:33.496]  And because if they could steal it, if they could steal it that way, that's how they want to steal it.
[05:24:33.557 --> 05:24:39.722]  If they could steal it behind the scenes with people flooding the ballot boxes and voting five times and dead people voting, they'll do it that way.
[05:24:40.162 --> 05:24:43.946]  But if Trump comes out with an overwhelming victory, they're going to have no choice.
[05:24:44.286 --> 05:24:46.929]  But notice how there haven't been any Black Lives Matter riots lately.
[05:24:47.665 --> 05:24:48.646]  Everything's been quiet.
[05:24:48.986 --> 05:24:50.566]  They're waiting for their chance to strike.
[05:24:50.646 --> 05:24:52.567]  It's the calm before the storm.
[05:24:52.687 --> 05:24:53.308]  They will strike.
[05:24:53.628 --> 05:24:54.808]  It'll be riots everywhere.
[05:24:55.289 --> 05:24:59.050]  And it might even be precipitated with some guy getting killed.
[05:24:59.491 --> 05:25:02.072]  Somebody has to get shot to kick these things off.
[05:25:03.112 --> 05:25:05.334]  So it'll be very interesting to see how it all plays out.
[05:25:05.374 --> 05:25:07.815]  Let's go to Larry Nichols' clip, and then I got Joe Biggs.
[05:25:08.735 --> 05:25:10.236]  Yesterday I couldn't have been noticed.
[05:25:10.256 --> 05:25:11.697]  Here comes a poll on Fox.
[05:25:12.037 --> 05:25:14.358]  And it's by Wall Street Journal and NBC.
[05:25:15.592 --> 05:25:20.476]  And the reporter on Fox or the host was saying, you know, this is a good poll.
[05:25:20.556 --> 05:25:23.679]  Basically, he was saying it was the gold standard of polls.
[05:25:23.739 --> 05:25:26.341]  Well, I went and looked at the internals of that poll.
[05:25:27.442 --> 05:25:28.983]  You see, Alex, people don't do this.
[05:25:29.424 --> 05:25:32.687]  But you go in and it said they had interviewed 905 people.
[05:25:36.545 --> 05:25:40.909]  And that it had a plus or minus accuracy of 3.2%.
[05:25:41.269 --> 05:25:46.795]  Well, that's funny, because when you look inside, there are three categories of respondents to a poll.
[05:25:47.035 --> 05:25:49.877]  Number one is a hang-up, that somebody hangs up and doesn't take it.
[05:25:50.358 --> 05:25:53.841]  Number two is interview.
[05:25:54.402 --> 05:26:00.107]  Interview means, folks, somebody that started out taking the poll, but then for whatever reason quit.
[05:26:01.036 --> 05:26:02.497]  And then you have respondents.
[05:26:02.697 --> 05:26:07.279]  Now, respondents are the only people, Alex, you count in a poll.
[05:26:07.759 --> 05:26:09.500]  Statistically, that's it.
[05:26:09.620 --> 05:26:15.823]  And a respondent is somebody that answers 90% or better of the questions in the survey.
[05:26:16.823 --> 05:26:22.466]  Now, do you have any... Now, 905, you know, nationwide, that's not a very big sample anyway.
[05:26:22.966 --> 05:26:25.907]  But do you know how many people actually were respondents? 492.
[05:26:30.715 --> 05:26:44.238]  492.
[05:26:30.735 --> 05:26:44.238]  When you use the standard basis by figuring margin of error, that puts it at 6 point margin of error plus, which means statistically that poll is zipped.
[05:26:44.258 --> 05:26:55.060]  But I mean for me that is a gold standard compared to the other ones where they'll get 40, 50, 60, 70 percent more Democrats in the sample than they do Republicans and they admit in the methodology they're doing that.
[05:26:55.080 --> 05:26:55.880]  This is ridiculous.
[05:26:56.380 --> 05:26:58.081]  Well, that's what they did in this poll.
[05:26:58.141 --> 05:27:09.524]  When you look at the poll, what you find out is 60% of the people that completed in that 492, 60% of them were, guess what, Democrats.
[05:27:10.205 --> 05:27:12.105]  To 40% Republicans.
[05:27:12.125 --> 05:27:14.006]  And how do you get them to get the Republicans to hang up?
[05:27:14.086 --> 05:27:17.847]  I'll tell you, it's on record that I've got a few of these over the years.
[05:27:17.907 --> 05:27:19.668]  As soon as you start answering the way they don't want,
[05:27:20.308 --> 05:27:21.268]  It just disconnects.
[05:27:21.328 --> 05:27:22.209]  The phone disconnects.
[05:27:22.269 --> 05:27:24.870]  That's how they kick you out and that's how they get more Democrats.
[05:27:25.370 --> 05:27:30.052]  That's how you find out what happened to that 400 that they started out interviewing.
[05:27:30.892 --> 05:27:35.974]  Most of the time you would think that 400 would be people that hang up on the interviewer.
[05:27:36.374 --> 05:27:36.734]  No.
[05:27:37.394 --> 05:27:41.336]  What happened when somebody gives the answer they don't like, they hang up on them.
[05:27:41.966 --> 05:27:42.507]  They hang up.
[05:27:43.107 --> 05:27:44.208]  Now, it's linear.
[05:27:44.868 --> 05:27:49.953]  Every question in that poll that related to, do you want Hillary or Trump?
[05:27:50.493 --> 05:27:54.836]  Do you think Hillary's a better leader than Trump, or Trump a better leader?
[05:27:55.117 --> 05:27:58.780]  Every question that was relevant, guess what?
[05:27:58.800 --> 05:27:59.580]  60-40.
[05:27:59.600 --> 05:27:59.961]  60-40.
[05:27:59.981 --> 05:28:00.681]  60-40.
[05:28:02.202 --> 05:28:06.186]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[05:28:06.346 --> 05:28:08.988]  Americanism, not globalism.
[05:28:09.148 --> 05:28:11.150]  Americanism, not globalism.

[05:28:17.234 --> 05:28:19.415]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[05:28:19.535 --> 05:28:26.339]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[05:28:26.559 --> 05:28:29.841]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[05:28:29.861 --> 05:28:31.022]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[05:28:31.342 --> 05:28:37.726]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of energy compounds that are gonna fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[05:28:37.986 --> 05:28:38.786]  This is sustainable.
[05:28:38.906 --> 05:28:40.067]  This isn't going to spike
[05:28:40.287 --> 05:28:42.888]  And you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[05:28:43.088 --> 05:28:46.249]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[05:28:46.309 --> 05:28:49.350]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[05:28:49.390 --> 05:28:50.870]  We're looking at the television screen.
[05:28:50.910 --> 05:28:56.612]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.

[05:29:12.460 --> 05:29:15.162]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[05:29:15.343 --> 05:29:18.425]  That communist Chinese-style net censorship is coming to the web.
[05:29:18.745 --> 05:29:19.506]  Because it's already here.
[05:29:19.886 --> 05:29:20.526]  It's being announced.
[05:29:20.887 --> 05:29:24.389]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.

[05:29:35.658 --> 05:29:36.659]  Are you gonna be part of history?

[05:30:15.801 --> 05:30:21.766]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[05:30:53.770 --> 05:30:55.291]  All right, we're back live.
[05:30:55.391 --> 05:30:57.832]  It's part of our 13 hours of coverage.
[05:31:11.644 --> 05:31:15.725]  And I'm so engrossed in what's going on, I'm undoing paperclips at this point.
[05:31:15.745 --> 05:31:16.486]  I'm so nervous.
[05:31:16.526 --> 05:31:17.886]  This is going to be a great debate tonight.
[05:31:18.586 --> 05:31:19.947]  Hopefully Trump comes out swinging.
[05:31:20.487 --> 05:31:21.707]  Plenty of people have been giving him advice.
[05:31:21.747 --> 05:31:28.169]  Nigel Farage is in Las Vegas, hopefully to be giving him some fight day advice.
[05:31:28.309 --> 05:31:29.490]  I've been hearing that song all day.
[05:31:29.770 --> 05:31:32.011]  It's the final countdown.
[05:31:33.376 --> 05:31:51.823]  And we got a few more callers, and the reason Joe Biggs is in here, and the reason we played that Larry Nichols clip, how he analyzed that last poll, that public NBC poll, I think is what it was, and how he found all these different areas where they can miscue the data, and show you wrong data, and not show you the full picture.
[05:31:51.843 --> 05:31:54.824]  They say we talked to 900 people, but actually they only talked to 492.
[05:31:56.204 --> 05:32:03.573]  They're leaving out 400 people that hung up or didn't fully answer the poll and it's the way they ask the questions, it's the way they get the data.
[05:32:03.953 --> 05:32:08.759]  Now you have a buddy, and we're going to go to him in a second, he's going to be on Skype, your buddy Jordan.
[05:32:10.129 --> 05:32:20.433]  He owns call centers, he's an entrepreneur, he owns t-shirt companies, and he decided, he heard somebody talking about one of his buddies doing political polls, he says, hey I'll do a political poll, let's see what happens.
[05:32:20.873 --> 05:32:24.274]  So he ran one on the 11th and one on the 19th.
[05:32:24.354 --> 05:32:30.617]  And then today, earlier this morning, and he just emailed me another one as well, so I haven't had a chance to look at all those numbers.
[05:32:30.637 --> 05:32:32.157]  We'll take a look at those later tonight.
[05:32:32.177 --> 05:32:34.078]  And he's calling like thousands of people at once.
[05:32:34.138 --> 05:32:38.019]  You know, he's doing like a 5,000 person call, and it's random, it's not biased.
[05:32:38.039 --> 05:32:43.440]  We're not looking at political affiliation, you know, race, gender, religion, anything like that.
[05:32:43.460 --> 05:32:47.401]  It's just an age group.
[05:32:47.802 --> 05:32:52.463]  We're going like 25 to 55, completely unbiased, and we submit the questions.
[05:32:52.503 --> 05:32:57.244]  Like, you know, for instance, do you consider yourself a Republican or Democrat is one of the questions.
[05:32:57.984 --> 05:33:00.665]  The other one is, are you going to vote in the upcoming election?
[05:33:01.673 --> 05:33:04.057]  Are you a registered Democrat, Republican, Independent, or Other?
[05:33:05.017 --> 05:33:06.177]  It's a presidential election.
[05:33:06.197 --> 05:33:10.358]  In this presidential election, will you vote for Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, other or undecided?
[05:33:11.138 --> 05:33:12.959]  And what is the most important issue to you?
[05:33:13.219 --> 05:33:13.359]  Right.
[05:33:13.399 --> 05:33:14.419]  So everyone's getting these calls.
[05:33:14.439 --> 05:33:15.920]  And the computer doesn't care who you are.
[05:33:15.960 --> 05:33:18.080]  It's essentially a robot.
[05:33:18.360 --> 05:33:22.741]  Now, we got these on these pie charts that are really hard to see on television.
[05:33:23.401 --> 05:33:26.702]  And so we're getting the graphics fixed up, looking nice.
[05:33:26.742 --> 05:33:30.463]  And as soon as they get those ready, we're going to start showing those on screen.
[05:33:30.803 --> 05:33:33.444]  And while we're waiting for that, I just want to remind you that
[05:33:34.985 --> 05:33:40.429]  We are fully supported by you out there, the viewer, watching, spreading the links.
[05:33:40.529 --> 05:33:44.172]  Infowars.com forward slash show is the link to watch this live.
[05:33:44.232 --> 05:33:47.335]  We're going to be going on until midnight, maybe even a little bit after tonight.
[05:33:48.075 --> 05:33:49.977]  We're going to be covering the debate starting at seven.
[05:33:49.997 --> 05:33:52.579]  We got our pre-show, then the debate from eight to nine thirty.
[05:33:52.599 --> 05:33:55.321]  Then we're going to have analysis afterwards, take more phone calls.
[05:33:55.341 --> 05:33:57.483]  So if you don't get in now, call back later tonight.
[05:33:57.503 --> 05:34:05.285]  And during all that time, we're going to be shooting videos, highlights, breaking down what's happened, the key parts of the debate between Hillary and Trump.
[05:34:05.325 --> 05:34:06.786]  I mean, this is the final debate.
[05:34:06.826 --> 05:34:09.347]  I mean, the next step is November 8th.
[05:34:09.407 --> 05:34:09.627]  Yeah.
[05:34:09.727 --> 05:34:13.328]  And hopefully you go out and wear that brand new Trump is my president t-shirt that's in all red.
[05:34:13.688 --> 05:34:14.708]  Wear that when you go vote.
[05:34:14.748 --> 05:34:18.369]  Let people see how many people truly do love Donald Trump.
[05:34:18.389 --> 05:34:21.830]  Because like we've seen in the past before, these polls are very skewed.
[05:34:22.150 --> 05:34:23.171]  They're screwing with us.
[05:34:24.511 --> 05:34:24.891]  I think so.
[05:34:44.696 --> 05:34:49.922]  Yeah, and we're going to have bonafide proof here in a second, at least from an independent, outside source.
[05:34:50.222 --> 05:34:51.303]  It's not affiliated with us.
[05:34:51.583 --> 05:34:55.808]  I mean, you know the guy, but he's, and I mean, full disclosure, he's probably a Trump fan, right?
[05:34:55.888 --> 05:34:56.349]  I don't even know.
[05:34:56.389 --> 05:34:56.869]  We'll ask him.
[05:34:56.909 --> 05:34:58.251]  Yeah, he is.
[05:34:58.551 --> 05:35:04.457]  But he plugs the questions in, the computer calls people, they answer, they hit the button.
[05:35:04.778 --> 05:35:06.580]  There's no interface of a human going,
[05:35:06.980 --> 05:35:07.821]  Do you like Trump?
[05:35:07.841 --> 05:35:09.622]  What do you think of Trump's sexist comments?
[05:35:09.662 --> 05:35:10.383]  What do you think of this?
[05:35:10.403 --> 05:35:13.986]  Well, some of the other polls, too, as well, though, is if you say yes to Trump, it'll hang up.
[05:35:14.066 --> 05:35:16.788]  Or if you say you're Republican, it'll hang up and cut you off.
[05:35:16.848 --> 05:35:18.169]  So there's no hang-ups here.
[05:35:18.189 --> 05:35:27.077]  This is complete and totally unbiased, and the computer shoots back the data to us, and then we just read it and look at the pie, the chart, and tell you what it says.
[05:35:27.217 --> 05:35:30.640]  There might be hang-ups from people hanging up, but we're not disconnecting the calls.
[05:35:30.680 --> 05:35:32.661]  He's not disconnecting them when he does these polls.
[05:35:33.662 --> 05:35:35.403]  Don't forget with 25% off Brain Force.
[05:35:35.443 --> 05:35:36.604]  We also have free shipping.
[05:35:36.724 --> 05:35:38.986]  Free shipping today.
[05:35:39.026 --> 05:35:40.327]  I'm not sure how long it's gonna run.
[05:35:40.367 --> 05:35:41.487]  So get your order in today.
[05:35:41.928 --> 05:35:46.150]  Also Living Defense is back in stock and Hillary for Prison t-shirts that last run.
[05:35:46.170 --> 05:35:48.652]  Joe, what are you gonna do after Hillary for Prison is done?
[05:35:49.313 --> 05:35:50.133]  That was your main crusade.
[05:35:50.153 --> 05:35:52.575]  It's not over until she is in jail.
[05:35:53.435 --> 05:35:56.938]  Hillary for prison goes on for me for as long as it needs to go on.
[05:35:57.559 --> 05:36:03.903]  Every, until every last single wiki leaks is out, until every last known fact that we find out about her, I will fight.
[05:36:04.504 --> 05:36:06.926]  Right, and we're going to have Jordan Salkin on here.
[05:36:06.966 --> 05:36:08.647]  Just one second, I want to go to a phone call first.
[05:36:08.687 --> 05:36:10.028]  Let's go to Stuart in Canada.
[05:36:10.469 --> 05:36:15.172]  Trump, he wants to talk about Trump, the fixed election, and the Chris Curtis software is designed to be fixed.
[05:36:15.192 --> 05:36:16.693]  I assume you're talking about that.
[05:36:18.715 --> 05:36:24.780]  Electronic voting machine software that gives you no receipt made by the same companies that produce ATM machines.
[05:36:24.800 --> 05:36:25.901]  Is that what you're talking about, Stuart?
[05:36:26.762 --> 05:36:27.923]  Yes, anyone can Google it.
[05:36:27.963 --> 05:36:34.028]  On December 13, 2004, they had a House Judiciary hearing and he testified.
[05:36:34.088 --> 05:36:40.994]  He said he was the software engineer that designed the software and it was designed to fix the election.
[05:36:41.554 --> 05:36:43.956]  No, I have friends that had robocalls in the last election.
[05:36:43.996 --> 05:36:45.558]  When Jack Layton, he was an NDP
[05:37:03.597 --> 05:37:29.923]  More of a left-leaning, but he was anti-war and he was drawing a lot of attention to going invading Iraq under false pretenses and then right on the eve of our election and you know a lot of people don't know this how critical it was that they took out what I call Osama bin Laden's double because I mean they dumped that body in the ocean we'll never know what it was but we do I know this personally
[05:37:30.407 --> 05:37:45.519]  People were so fed up with mainstream politics in Canada, they wanted to send Stephen Harper, who we all identified as a warmonger, we wanted to send him a real message and put Jack Layton in, who was far left-leaning, but it was just going to teach him a lesson.
[05:37:45.539 --> 05:37:57.929]  And go figure, Osama Bin Laden gets assassinated and everybody that voted for Stephen Harper in Canada, every old person that, you know, every right-winger that, I shouldn't say right-winger because
[05:37:58.510 --> 05:38:05.295]  It's a stigma, but everybody on the far-leaning right was saying, that's why I voted for Stephen Harper.
[05:38:05.615 --> 05:38:07.157]  And I know they said it to their families.
[05:38:07.197 --> 05:38:11.320]  This was on the eve of our election, and it had a huge sway.
[05:38:11.720 --> 05:38:21.087]  And then I had friends that were getting robocalls, being led to wrong-polling offices and stuff, and nobody went to jail.
[05:38:22.901 --> 05:38:23.881]  You know, confirmed.
[05:38:25.222 --> 05:38:26.902]  No one ever goes to jail with these.
[05:38:27.382 --> 05:38:28.742]  Joe, were you in Iraq?
[05:38:28.762 --> 05:38:30.043]  Hold on for a second, Stewart.
[05:38:30.123 --> 05:38:33.183]  Were you in Iraq when they had their first elections after the war?
[05:38:33.923 --> 05:38:34.844]  What year was that?
[05:38:35.204 --> 05:38:39.785]  I don't even know what it was, but I know it was like maybe 2005, 2006, something like that.
[05:38:39.825 --> 05:38:40.625]  They started having elections.
[05:38:40.645 --> 05:38:41.405]  Yes, I was there then.
[05:38:42.625 --> 05:38:44.886]  They had to dip their thumb in purple.
[05:38:45.346 --> 05:38:46.726]  Oh yeah, I remember that.
[05:38:46.766 --> 05:38:50.167]  Walk around with a purple thumb that shows they voted and so they couldn't go back and vote again.
[05:38:51.058 --> 05:38:54.942]  Okay, we don't have that in this country, and we're one of the most advanced countries in the world.
[05:38:54.962 --> 05:39:01.008]  Maybe we don't need purple thumb dipping, but why is it a sticker that you can take off, that that's the only thing that says you voted?
[05:39:01.328 --> 05:39:01.989]  Your little sticker.
[05:39:02.249 --> 05:39:03.791]  We don't have any paper trail.
[05:39:03.871 --> 05:39:05.012]  We have nothing.
[05:39:05.493 --> 05:39:08.516]  And yet we go, well, we have the most fairest elections in the free world.
[05:39:09.719 --> 05:39:10.539]  We don't know who votes.
[05:39:11.060 --> 05:39:11.760]  We don't know who votes.
[05:39:11.780 --> 05:39:12.940]  We don't know how often they vote.
[05:39:13.020 --> 05:39:14.461]  We don't know if they're alive when they vote.
[05:39:14.661 --> 05:39:19.583]  I mean, based off of those brand new James O'Keefe videos, I mean, it is completely... Anybody gets to vote!
[05:39:20.083 --> 05:39:21.143]  And they're shipping voters in.
[05:39:21.183 --> 05:39:26.065]  They're finding out ways to use vehicles so it doesn't spark any suspicion.
[05:39:27.166 --> 05:39:28.306]  You know, the buses.
[05:39:28.426 --> 05:39:30.167]  I mean, it's completely and totally out of control.
[05:39:30.207 --> 05:39:35.469]  The trickery that they're willing to go to to get a vote for whatever candidate it is that they want to push.
[05:39:36.246 --> 05:39:37.326]  Yeah, exactly.
[05:39:37.787 --> 05:39:38.907]  Hey Stuart, thanks for the call.
[05:39:38.927 --> 05:39:40.308]  I guess elections are being fixed everywhere.
[05:39:40.328 --> 05:39:43.829]  Let's go to Carl and Matt and then we're going to bring on our guest, Jordan Salkin.
[05:39:44.449 --> 05:39:45.010]  Go ahead, Carl.
[05:39:46.030 --> 05:39:46.490]  Hello.
[05:39:47.290 --> 05:39:49.251]  Hi, what's your question or comment?
[05:39:50.652 --> 05:39:55.774]  Hi, I just wanted to report some whistleblower information to you guys.
[05:39:56.294 --> 05:39:56.634]  Okay.
[05:39:57.655 --> 05:40:02.297]  Basically, you guys should check out PropSteve.org.
[05:40:03.637 --> 05:40:04.577]  Hold on, repeat that again.
[05:40:04.637 --> 05:40:05.018]  What was that?
[05:40:05.158 --> 05:40:05.478]  What.org?
[05:40:07.014 --> 05:40:08.715]  Prophecies.org.
[05:40:08.755 --> 05:40:17.442]  That's P-O, I mean not P-O, P-R-O-P-H-E-C-I-E-S.org.
[05:40:17.903 --> 05:40:32.454]  It basically goes into information on like the Fildenberg Group, Rothschild, and it kind of goes into a lot of information on, well, I mean I would think like a lot of the corrupt
[05:40:33.260 --> 05:40:35.303]  Uh, government that's going on here in the U.S.
[05:40:35.363 --> 05:40:41.129]  and a lot of other corrupt things that are going on in the world right now, so... Sorry, I'm a little nervous.
[05:40:41.810 --> 05:40:43.832]  But, uh, you guys should definitely check it out.
[05:40:43.852 --> 05:40:45.374]  It has, like, tons of information.
[05:40:45.394 --> 05:40:45.955]  It's free.
[05:40:45.975 --> 05:40:48.418]  You can print out all the information you want.
[05:40:48.438 --> 05:40:50.340]  You can download it.
[05:40:50.360 --> 05:40:52.742]  So, please look into that.
[05:40:52.762 --> 05:40:53.764]  It's worth your while.
[05:40:55.439 --> 05:40:55.779]  Excellent.
[05:40:55.799 --> 05:40:56.180]  Well, thank you.
[05:40:56.240 --> 05:41:01.184]  I'll check that out after I get off here and and see what you always got to look at.
[05:41:01.224 --> 05:41:04.407]  There's always these websites that come out and I'm not sure who runs them.
[05:41:04.787 --> 05:41:09.591]  I'm finding more fake websites than anything these days that come out and have these outlandish things.
[05:41:09.851 --> 05:41:11.673]  I'll tell you this if you ever see something that says
[05:41:12.453 --> 05:41:16.236]  Uh, it comes from a report from the Kremlin or a report circulating around the Kremlin.
[05:41:16.596 --> 05:41:18.317]  It is most likely disinfo.
[05:41:18.337 --> 05:41:19.738]  I'm not saying that in your case, Carl.
[05:41:19.778 --> 05:41:23.401]  I'm going to check out, uh, that, that, uh, site and see what they say.
[05:41:23.841 --> 05:41:31.146]  But anytime it says reports circulate around the Kremlin, it's written by a certain person and they are bona fide disinfo.
[05:41:31.166 --> 05:41:32.527]  I'm not going to mention their name on air.
[05:41:32.827 --> 05:41:35.809]  I'll let everybody else do their own searches and find that out.
[05:41:36.129 --> 05:41:37.950]  Now let's bring on Jordan Salkin.
[05:41:38.490 --> 05:41:48.994]  He is an entrepreneur who, uh, he works, he owns call centers, he does all kinds of stuff, he owns t-shirt companies, and he started making and putting out these, um, robocalls is what he calls them.
[05:41:49.034 --> 05:41:53.055]  And, you know, sometimes you hear the word robocall and you freak out, you go, that's bad!
[05:41:53.335 --> 05:41:54.335]  Robocalls are bad!
[05:41:54.395 --> 05:41:58.817]  And yeah, uh, Congress did outlaw them and put restrictions on them.
[05:41:59.177 --> 05:42:04.419]  Although, what's interesting is usually what Congress does is they make laws for you, but they're exempt from them.
[05:42:04.859 --> 05:42:09.103]  Congress and Congressional candidates are allowed to robocall as much as they want because it's a political process.
[05:42:09.884 --> 05:42:11.666]  So, Jordan, are you there, buddy?
[05:42:11.726 --> 05:42:12.146]  Can you hear me?
[05:42:13.287 --> 05:42:14.068]  Here, can you hear me alright?
[05:42:14.268 --> 05:42:15.069]  Yeah, I can hear you great.
[05:42:15.369 --> 05:42:25.279]  So, let's just go into the quick, you were telling me earlier about the robocalls and how that works, and then why you decided to do these polls, and then let's get right into the polls.
[05:42:25.519 --> 05:42:27.721]  I want to say really quick, I can't hear Jordan at all.
[05:42:29.858 --> 05:42:30.179]  Testing.
[05:42:30.199 --> 05:42:30.919]  Can you hear me okay?
[05:42:31.260 --> 05:42:31.800]  I can hear you.
[05:42:31.820 --> 05:42:32.261]  Can you hear me?
[05:42:32.281 --> 05:42:32.541]  All right.
[05:42:33.042 --> 05:42:33.282]  Excellent.
[05:42:33.302 --> 05:42:34.003]  I can hear you just fine.
[05:42:34.083 --> 05:42:37.707]  So I want to touch base on the terminology of robocall.
[05:42:37.747 --> 05:42:45.476]  Basically, it's kind of like a bad word that was put out by the FCC when they decided to ban people from businesses from calling consumers.
[05:42:46.458 --> 05:42:51.979]  They wanted to give it a negative connotation, but guess who was left with the ability to call whoever they want whenever they wanted?
[05:42:52.339 --> 05:42:53.400]  Politicians in government.
[05:42:54.580 --> 05:43:00.001]  The caveat to that is that it allows us to still run political polls uninterrupted for the time being.
[05:43:00.881 --> 05:43:03.482]  So that is sort of the long and the short of it.
[05:43:03.502 --> 05:43:09.023]  We actually call the voice broadcasting the actual terminology that's preferred.
[05:43:09.063 --> 05:43:12.564]  Robocalls was sort of put out to deceive the public.
[05:43:13.324 --> 05:43:14.065]  I'll give it a bad name.
[05:43:15.245 --> 05:43:17.887]  Now, which poll did you guys have up?
[05:43:18.307 --> 05:43:34.477]  Basically, my partner does political polling and I was listening to the show the other morning and I stopped and I called him and I said, does anybody ever run a unbiased poll with real data, with real stats, unbiased statistics?
[05:43:34.517 --> 05:43:35.737]  And he honestly, he said no.
[05:43:35.757 --> 05:43:39.800]  They bring him the data and they bring him the questions and he just is in charge of running it.
[05:43:40.440 --> 05:43:44.483]  Uh, at which point I decided to contact you guys and let you know that I have the ability to do this.
[05:43:44.563 --> 05:43:47.746]  I went immediately into my office and ran my first poll, which I sent you.
[05:43:47.766 --> 05:43:49.207]  I think that's the infographic that you have.
[05:43:49.387 --> 05:43:50.948]  Yeah, that was on the 11th, I believe.
[05:43:51.328 --> 05:43:53.270]  Yeah, so I have two questions here.
[05:43:53.450 --> 05:43:56.532]  One is, do you consider yourself a Republican, Democrat or Independent?
[05:43:57.645 --> 05:44:11.255]  And that was run on the 11th, and you've got 43% Republican, 35% Democrat, 22% Independent, which most of these people kind of fall into the Democratic territory, and 1% other, with a total of 156.
[05:44:11.395 --> 05:44:13.476]  Is that the total number of people that answered?
[05:44:13.496 --> 05:44:17.279]  For that particular one, just so you know that most political polls
[05:44:19.170 --> 05:44:26.725]  Republicans skew them and they skew them a little bit by organizing the questions in a fashion that leads somebody to a question and answer.
[05:44:27.486 --> 05:44:28.929]  Democrats tend to take
[05:44:30.569 --> 05:44:31.149]  I think so.
[05:44:54.534 --> 05:44:55.074]  Exactly.
[05:45:09.165 --> 05:45:14.387]  And then if you go to the third one, the last one, it says, what is the most important issue for you in the upcoming election?
[05:45:15.347 --> 05:45:17.028]  The winner got economy, that's number one, 35%.
[05:45:17.068 --> 05:45:17.468]  Healthcare, 5%.
[05:45:17.508 --> 05:45:18.068]  Immigration was 24%.
[05:45:18.128 --> 05:45:19.049]  Foreign affairs, 9%.
[05:45:19.089 --> 05:45:19.489]  And environment, 27%.
[05:45:25.931 --> 05:45:29.973]  So most people are caring about the economy, that's a big thing for them.
[05:45:30.333 --> 05:45:44.698]  And that's one of the key things that Trump is always talking about, how jobs are being sent overseas, we need to bring more jobs back here, and the fact that Obamacare is a complete and total failure screws up a lot of these small businesses and a lot of jobs go other places because they can't pay for that.
[05:45:44.718 --> 05:45:46.138]  It costs a lot of money to have that.
[05:45:46.258 --> 05:45:53.101]  So we're losing jobs and that's why people want to have a strong economy and that's why Trump's been very popular and strong in that area.
[05:45:54.481 --> 05:45:59.808]  One tidbit of information that you might find funny, when you run a democratic leaning poll,
[05:46:02.654 --> 05:46:10.076]  A large number of them, just like it is here, are very concerned with the economy, which I find to be funny, because why would they be voting for a Democrat?
[05:46:10.116 --> 05:46:10.776]  That makes no sense.
[05:46:10.816 --> 05:46:12.496]  But then again, it's the uninformed masses.
[05:46:12.936 --> 05:46:13.776]  They don't know what they're doing.
[05:46:13.796 --> 05:46:19.738]  Well, and they think they're going to get some break from Hillary Clinton, even though it's admitted in her tax plan that everybody's taxes are going up.
[05:46:20.198 --> 05:46:30.240]  And Donald Trump's tax plan, across the board, it's even independent people have shown, independent studies have shown, that you're going to have lower taxes, you're going to have more money back in your pocket.
[05:46:30.940 --> 05:46:33.122]  And that's a big point I think he needs to push home.
[05:46:33.162 --> 05:46:34.103]  And he did it in the last debate.
[05:46:34.123 --> 05:46:35.864]  He said, she's going to raise your taxes, folks.
[05:46:36.204 --> 05:46:37.125]  I'm going to lower your taxes.
[05:46:37.165 --> 05:46:41.148]  And she goes, well, just for the millionaires, everybody's going to get a tax break.
[05:46:41.529 --> 05:46:44.251]  I'm going to raise taxes on the middle class.
[05:46:44.291 --> 05:46:46.512]  Yeah, she even admits she's going to raise taxes on the middle class.
[05:46:46.913 --> 05:46:48.774]  Now you did another poll on the 19th.
[05:46:48.834 --> 05:46:49.775]  We've got this one here.
[05:46:50.315 --> 05:46:52.817]  And actually, Trump has gone up in your poll.
[05:46:53.678 --> 05:47:07.531]  From 50% to 55% and Hillary's gone down 3% from 30% to 27% and it looks like the undecideds have gone down just a bit and the others have stayed.
[05:47:07.871 --> 05:47:12.415]  So if you look at the two polls that you've run independently, Donald Trump is going up 5%.
[05:47:14.502 --> 05:47:15.642]  Yeah, this was 10 a.m.
[05:47:15.902 --> 05:47:17.403]  Pacific time this morning I ran this.
[05:47:18.243 --> 05:47:20.663]  I ran another one around 1.30, but the data is really the same.
[05:47:21.703 --> 05:47:26.664]  You can see that I attribute this to news that is taking place, breaking news.
[05:47:26.704 --> 05:47:29.545]  Maybe it's WikiLeaks, although it's silenced by the mainstream media.
[05:47:30.425 --> 05:47:38.367]  You know, whatever it is, she's losing her fan base, or more people are deciding to, or waking up, so to say.
[05:47:38.907 --> 05:47:41.107]  But this was run today, so you can see a little bit of the show.
[05:47:41.407 --> 05:47:43.728]  I want to let you guys know and preface it, this data,
[05:47:44.807 --> 05:47:54.555]  It's homogenous, meaning it's blindly sorted and randomized amongst state, race, age, gender, employment, all the factors.
[05:47:54.615 --> 05:47:59.760]  We don't select a, it is purposely not selected by voter registration.
[05:47:59.840 --> 05:48:01.301]  So it is homogenous data.
[05:48:01.321 --> 05:48:03.063]  This is as true as I feel we can get.
[05:48:03.983 --> 05:48:13.528]  Um, and most, like I said, most polls are a few hundred people, whereas this is several thousand, uh, run in total, and then whoever decides to answer.
[05:48:13.588 --> 05:48:18.250]  So many of these polls that you're hearing about in the news, it's 30, 40 people that answer the phone out of a few hundred.
[05:48:19.338 --> 05:48:29.367]  Right, and the one Larry Nichols was talking about, he said there was 900 people called and only, I think, 400 actually made it into the actual polling results.
[05:48:29.427 --> 05:48:30.988]  And the other 450 or so, or 400, I think it was 450 made it in.
[05:48:31.028 --> 05:48:31.308]  The other 450...
[05:48:35.512 --> 05:48:36.493]  We're just left on the planks.
[05:48:36.513 --> 05:48:37.113]  Well, it's amazing.
[05:48:37.133 --> 05:48:42.858]  I mean, after each debate thus far, Trump has won in every single poll except for like one or two.
[05:48:43.558 --> 05:48:46.020]  One being the Clinton News Network's CNN every time.
[05:48:46.521 --> 05:48:46.761]  Why?
[05:48:46.821 --> 05:48:56.389]  Because the only people watching that are Democrats or these Clintonites that just will grovel at her feet regardless of the fact that she is a complete and total career criminal.
[05:48:56.749 --> 05:48:57.289]  No one cares.
[05:48:57.309 --> 05:48:59.751]  They're just going to vote for her blindly because that's their party.
[05:49:00.212 --> 05:49:03.795]  You know, we've got a lot of people who have been libertarians that will go to a Republican
[05:49:04.355 --> 05:49:05.816]  To vote for Trump this time, you know?
[05:49:05.996 --> 05:49:10.580]  We've had some people who would only stick with Libertarian, but there's a lot of people out there that'll be flexible.
[05:49:10.600 --> 05:49:12.382]  If they like what the person's saying, they'll go to it.
[05:49:12.642 --> 05:49:16.185]  They're not in love with a party, so to say.
[05:49:16.565 --> 05:49:20.188]  But it's interesting, the one you did today, it says, independent presidential poll results.
[05:49:20.508 --> 05:49:22.490]  Are you going to vote in this November election?
[05:49:22.510 --> 05:49:27.754]  93% of the people said yes, and only 7% said no.
[05:49:28.174 --> 05:49:30.997]  And then if we move on, it says, are you registered as a Democrat?
[05:49:31.497 --> 05:49:33.118]  Republican, Independent, or Other?
[05:49:33.699 --> 05:49:39.664]  Democrat got 30%, Republican got 49%, and Independent got 16%, and then lastly, Other was at 5%.
[05:49:39.724 --> 05:49:41.205]  And then this is where we see the rise.
[05:49:46.274 --> 05:49:46.514]  This is
[05:50:10.407 --> 05:50:12.048]  The real results, you know?
[05:50:12.088 --> 05:50:12.969]  That's a large spread.
[05:50:12.989 --> 05:50:15.451]  That's a very large spread and a lot of times we're looking at these elections.
[05:50:15.471 --> 05:50:21.115]  I remember the last election, I'm watching this, they're saying it's by a hair, it's a half of a percent.
[05:50:21.756 --> 05:50:22.576]  I never bought that.
[05:50:24.237 --> 05:50:27.520]  I want to go out on a limb here and say this and I don't mean to offend anybody.
[05:50:27.960 --> 05:50:34.505]  Now more than ever, my faith in our system is hinging on this election.
[05:50:37.268 --> 05:50:38.308]  He's winning by a landslide.
[05:50:38.348 --> 05:50:39.209]  He has a popular vote.
[05:50:39.689 --> 05:50:44.691]  You heard George Soros in that video say that, of course, he's going to win the popular vote, but she's going to get elected.
[05:50:44.731 --> 05:50:46.271]  She's already elected, were his words.
[05:50:46.991 --> 05:50:47.552]  That's frightening.
[05:50:47.792 --> 05:50:49.012]  And we need to really take heed.
[05:50:49.052 --> 05:50:49.612]  We need to vote.
[05:50:49.712 --> 05:50:50.393]  I'm going to wear red.
[05:50:50.513 --> 05:50:51.013]  I never wear red.
[05:50:51.033 --> 05:50:52.413]  I'm going to wear red to the poll.
[05:50:52.813 --> 05:50:56.755]  I'm going to tell them I want to print out of my card, my voting.
[05:50:57.475 --> 05:51:05.018]  But, you know, we all have to turn out and we all have to have a contingency plan in case she gets elected, because I really do not believe with my heart that she's going to win.
[05:51:05.338 --> 05:51:05.798]  She should win.
[05:51:06.502 --> 05:51:07.985]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[05:51:08.005 --> 05:51:10.971]  It's fixed, and you can see the fix already happening.
[05:51:11.913 --> 05:51:15.781]  And people that can't see it or refuse to believe it, there's really no hope for you anyway.
[05:51:17.492 --> 05:51:19.333]  You know, you're going to believe no matter what they tell you.
[05:51:19.913 --> 05:51:21.273]  You'll believe the moon's made of cheese.
[05:51:21.973 --> 05:51:25.134]  So, Jordan, what's your Twitter?
[05:51:25.154 --> 05:51:26.995]  How can people... I know you're putting out more of these polls.
[05:51:27.055 --> 05:51:28.135]  Where can people find them?
[05:51:28.155 --> 05:51:29.316]  Where are you posting them right now?
[05:51:29.756 --> 05:51:31.256]  So, we have a website.
[05:51:31.276 --> 05:51:33.877]  It's politicalpollcall.com.
[05:51:33.997 --> 05:51:36.098]  It's politicalpollcall.com, that is for this.
[05:51:37.118 --> 05:51:44.180]  I have some other Twitters and things that are other businesses and other related things, but for the dialing for the polls, it's politicalpollcall.com.
[05:51:45.060 --> 05:51:45.701]  Thank you.
[05:52:04.795 --> 05:52:09.259]  That's a good thing for a lot of these college students, a lot of these people who want to know what's really going on in their state.
[05:52:09.279 --> 05:52:13.702]  You can single it down to that state, to that area, and find out what's going on, really.
[05:52:14.102 --> 05:52:16.704]  And really tailor what, you know, what people think is important.
[05:52:16.944 --> 05:52:25.731]  Because I don't think a lot of people, you know, would know that, you look at this last one, it says, you know, immigration is 24%, environment is 27%, economy is 35%.
[05:52:25.771 --> 05:52:25.811]  So,
[05:52:30.851 --> 05:52:32.112]  People really care about the economy.
[05:52:32.653 --> 05:52:34.655]  But you wouldn't think it from the Democrats.
[05:52:34.675 --> 05:52:43.845]  You would think that the most important thing in the world is bringing in massive immigration and that people talking about women is the most important thing in the world.
[05:52:44.005 --> 05:52:45.967]  Opening the borders and climate change.
[05:52:46.088 --> 05:52:47.149]  Yeah, climate change as well.
[05:52:47.629 --> 05:52:49.211]  Hey Jordan, thanks for joining us.
[05:52:49.571 --> 05:52:53.396]  My two-hour block is about to be up and we're going to go to Leanne McAdoo here in a second.
[05:52:53.937 --> 05:52:56.059]  And I'm going to be talking with you after this.
[05:52:56.099 --> 05:53:03.608]  Maybe we'll see about getting a post-debate poll to see who people think won the debate after tonight.
[05:53:05.470 --> 05:53:05.911]  All right, great.
[05:53:06.111 --> 05:53:15.082]  Yeah, let's talk about this after I get off the air and see if we can make it happen, because we're going to be here live, folks, till midnight, and maybe even a little bit longer, depending on how the crew feels.
[05:53:15.102 --> 05:53:17.124]  The crew seems to be in pretty good spirits right now.
[05:53:17.144 --> 05:53:22.351]  I see them scurrying around, looking for graphics and whatnot, and it's a good sign.
[05:53:23.992 --> 05:53:24.452]  To see.
[05:53:25.413 --> 05:53:27.434]  It looks like I got two more callers.
[05:53:27.714 --> 05:53:33.436]  Let's see if we can fit these guys in and then go to a short break so we can go to Leanne McAdoo.
[05:53:33.456 --> 05:53:34.337]  She's in the other studio.
[05:53:34.377 --> 05:53:37.318]  Maybe if she gets her headset on, we can even start talking to her.
[05:53:37.378 --> 05:53:38.739]  Let's go to John in Florida.
[05:53:39.379 --> 05:53:41.720]  Debate Trump expectations.
[05:53:42.901 --> 05:53:43.821]  Hey guys, how you doing?
[05:53:43.921 --> 05:53:44.601]  John D here.
[05:53:44.942 --> 05:53:45.502]  Doing great.
[05:53:45.542 --> 05:53:46.102]  Go ahead, John.
[05:53:46.822 --> 05:53:51.164]  Well, I just want to get a little house cleaning out of the way first.
[05:53:51.364 --> 05:53:52.365]  Joe, how you doing, buddy?
[05:53:55.185 --> 05:53:55.405]  Go.
[05:53:55.945 --> 05:53:56.586]  Yeah, go ahead.
[05:53:57.286 --> 05:54:02.129]  Hey, listen, there are a lot of people listening right now that are tuning in from Gab.
[05:54:02.509 --> 05:54:03.470]  Gab.ai.
[05:54:03.490 --> 05:54:04.290]  Oh, yeah.
[05:54:05.030 --> 05:54:08.472]  And I want to thank you for your interview with Andrew Torba.
[05:54:09.193 --> 05:54:09.733]  Oh, no problem.
[05:54:10.313 --> 05:54:15.856]  That's what got me to sign up on this new social media platform that is growing by thousands every day.
[05:54:16.457 --> 05:54:17.878]  There's a lot of people listening now.
[05:54:17.898 --> 05:54:24.021]  A lot of people joining like Scott Adams with the Dilbert creator, your cartoonist Ben Garrison.
[05:54:24.733 --> 05:54:27.135]  Milo's over there, and so on.
[05:54:27.175 --> 05:54:28.515]  So I'm going to make this quick.
[05:54:29.056 --> 05:54:29.936]  Tonight is a debate.
[05:54:31.197 --> 05:54:47.368]  And if I were Donald Trump, I would look at this situation completely different because of the WikiLeaks revelations and all these other, you know, the mainstream media non-reporting, misreporting, total abuse of Donald Trump.
[05:54:48.408 --> 05:54:54.052]  If I were Donald Trump, I would step onto that stage with the attitude, number one, that Hillary Clinton
[05:54:54.989 --> 05:54:56.189]  is absolute scum.
[05:54:57.550 --> 05:55:07.052]  I would have the attitude that she is not even a legitimate valid candidate to be standing on that stage with me.
[05:55:07.072 --> 05:55:18.554]  I would not play by the rules, Chris Wallace's rules, the debate rules, and I would, as Larry Nichols say, close my eyes and I would turn it into my own one-man band.
[05:55:19.474 --> 05:55:21.815]  Exactly.
[05:55:21.835 --> 05:55:24.577]  They should print out all these WikiLeaks documents.
[05:55:24.657 --> 05:55:25.878]  He should take that stage.
[05:55:25.918 --> 05:55:27.199]  This is all-out war.
[05:55:27.519 --> 05:55:29.080]  This is for the future of America.
[05:55:29.380 --> 05:55:46.870]  He should take that stage like a boss with all of these facts and show, lay out to the American public, to the world, how corrupt the DNC is, how corrupt Democrats are, and mostly how corrupt Hillary Clinton and her husband are with the Clinton Foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, and lay that out
[05:55:47.290 --> 05:55:50.012]  Right there on the main stage for the final showdown.
[05:55:50.212 --> 05:55:51.633]  This is all out war.
[05:55:51.753 --> 05:55:54.975]  Our future depends on it and this is something that he needs to do.
[05:55:55.236 --> 05:55:58.077]  Take control of this debate and don't let her get a word in.
[05:55:58.698 --> 05:56:10.346]  You're right and it's ridiculous you guys that we're even falling into this game of even treating her as though she should even be part of any type of a debate process.
[05:56:11.026 --> 05:56:15.950]  He needs just literally to take over the stage, have another Donald Trump rally and
[05:56:17.222 --> 05:56:19.384]  Walk away whenever he feels like he needs to.
[05:56:19.444 --> 05:56:20.926]  If he needs to, drop the mic.
[05:56:21.126 --> 05:56:22.347]  Drop the mic and walk out.
[05:56:40.236 --> 05:56:41.137]  To answer a question.
[05:56:41.157 --> 05:56:44.761]  And they'll actually, they're supposed to hit four or five different categories.
[05:56:44.781 --> 05:56:47.344]  Hopefully there'll be an actual debate of some sort.
[05:56:47.624 --> 05:56:51.328]  But I want to see Trump just completely and totally dominate each single time.
[05:56:51.997 --> 05:56:56.218]  Yeah, and he's had to learn the hard way and has gone through more than anybody should go through.
[05:56:56.338 --> 05:56:57.959]  So, thanks for the time, guys.
[05:56:57.979 --> 05:56:59.159]  We'll let the next caller come in.
[05:56:59.539 --> 05:57:00.239]  Alright, thanks, John.
[05:57:00.279 --> 05:57:01.019]  Let's go to Dennis.
[05:57:01.039 --> 05:57:06.181]  You're our final caller of this two-hour block that I've been manhandling here.
[05:57:06.241 --> 05:57:06.581]  Go ahead.
[05:57:06.621 --> 05:57:07.221]  You're in Indiana.
[05:57:07.241 --> 05:57:08.641]  I want to talk about media disinfo.
[05:57:08.981 --> 05:57:10.202]  It's everywhere, bro, isn't it?
[05:57:10.682 --> 05:57:11.242]  Hey, man.
[05:57:11.282 --> 05:57:12.102]  I love your guy's show.
[05:57:12.162 --> 05:57:15.103]  I'm also co-host on Prospectoradio.com.
[05:57:15.883 --> 05:57:17.423]  I really enjoy your guys' show.
[05:57:18.004 --> 05:57:19.664]  A couple things that I've got.
[05:57:20.698 --> 05:57:45.671]  And I find it pure entertainment is, is even if you, if you look right now and you go to CNN now earlier today, now they got more of their Clinton supporters, you know, supporters, not very many, but you know, they're running that CNN special and man, it's, there's been, of course they're saying Arizona, you know, Hillary's leading by eight points or whatever, but everybody in the background, they're Trump supporters.
[05:57:45.731 --> 05:57:48.152]  And every time you see on CNN,
[05:57:49.016 --> 05:57:51.757]  No matter where they're at, you've got Trump supporters in the back.
[05:57:51.817 --> 05:57:54.077]  Where's all these Clinton supporters at?
[05:57:54.097 --> 05:57:55.457]  There's none.
[05:57:55.537 --> 05:57:59.558]  I don't know where they come up with these polls, but it's pure entertainment to me.
[05:57:59.598 --> 05:58:00.998]  I find it hilarious.
[05:58:01.399 --> 05:58:13.441]  There's a new Podesta email that came out today in WikiLeaks where this guy's writing John Podesta, I can't remember the guy's name, but he's writing Podesta and he's like, I'm at the Washington University, and he's like,
[05:58:13.661 --> 05:58:14.161]  Nobody here.
[05:58:14.201 --> 05:58:15.642]  He's like, there's nobody here for Hillary.
[05:58:15.662 --> 05:58:16.663]  He's like, it's all Trump.
[05:58:16.743 --> 05:58:17.523]  It's all Bernie.
[05:58:17.944 --> 05:58:20.045]  He's like, there's not one single Hillary Clinton sticker.
[05:58:20.065 --> 05:58:20.945]  There's not one button.
[05:58:20.965 --> 05:58:22.066]  There's not one sign.
[05:58:22.386 --> 05:58:25.468]  And this is in an area that's extremely liberal.
[05:58:25.528 --> 05:58:26.749]  This should be a Clinton town.
[05:58:27.009 --> 05:58:28.570]  But you can't find these people.
[05:58:28.610 --> 05:58:30.491]  I mean, there are very few far and beyond.
[05:58:30.511 --> 05:58:32.052]  I was in... Oh.
[05:58:32.372 --> 05:58:38.136]  Hey, if you guys can pull that video up, we'll play that video as we transition.
[05:58:39.917 --> 05:58:40.297]  If not...
[05:58:41.394 --> 05:58:42.495]  Well, y'all play it for Leigh-Anne.
[05:58:42.535 --> 05:58:49.842]  We've got Nigel Farage, basically what Nigel Farage, his advice to Trump for the debate is going to be.
[05:58:49.902 --> 05:58:51.103]  This will be exclusive.
[05:58:51.424 --> 05:58:52.325]  This will be breaking.
[05:58:52.765 --> 05:58:56.309]  We're going to play this with Leigh-Anne when she comes up here in just a couple minutes.
[05:58:57.269 --> 05:58:58.711]  That's all the time that we're having today.
[05:58:58.771 --> 05:59:00.312]  Dennis, thanks for calling.
[05:59:00.392 --> 05:59:01.033]  I totally agree.
[05:59:01.073 --> 05:59:10.762]  It's total entertainment value watching these cretins on the mainstream media in their $500 suits acting like they know everything, telling you that you can't look at WikiLeaks emails.
[05:59:10.782 --> 05:59:11.182]  That's ridiculous.
[05:59:11.202 --> 05:59:12.163]  I read one last night.
[05:59:12.623 --> 05:59:13.284]  This guy's talking.
[05:59:13.304 --> 05:59:19.509]  He's like, I have a media source who's talking about Clinton's sex activity and how it's a detriment to Hillary.
[05:59:20.130 --> 05:59:21.071]  I think it's a positive.
[05:59:21.111 --> 05:59:22.672]  The guy actually says he thinks it's a positive.
[05:59:22.712 --> 05:59:23.413]  It's not a negative.
[05:59:23.473 --> 05:59:29.482]  There's a Washington Post guy who's emailing Podesta going, hey, before I run a story, can you look over this and make sure I don't have any f-ups?
[05:59:29.702 --> 05:59:30.023]  Yeah.
[05:59:30.223 --> 05:59:30.684]  I mean, come on.
[05:59:31.525 --> 05:59:33.028]  I don't know where these people get off.
[05:59:33.148 --> 05:59:36.152]  I can't believe that they're holding on to Hillary.
[05:59:37.584 --> 05:59:42.368]  It's literally like the media is grasping onto this zombie as it walks down the street.
[05:59:43.309 --> 05:59:46.231]  It's like, take us to the promised land!
[05:59:46.251 --> 05:59:47.151]  Take us, Hillary!
[05:59:47.612 --> 05:59:53.536]  And she's going... And she's just moving forward with, you know, I'm going to raise your taxes.
[05:59:53.596 --> 05:59:55.217]  What difference does it make?
[05:59:55.277 --> 05:59:57.139]  I mean, just shambling along.
[05:59:57.659 --> 05:59:59.040]  And she wants to eat out your substance.
[05:59:59.160 --> 06:00:03.303]  Meanwhile, she's passing starving Haitian kids and families who have nothing.
[06:00:03.343 --> 06:00:04.684]  Give me that money, kid.
[06:00:05.125 --> 06:00:06.486]  She's shoving it in her wallet.
[06:00:07.631 --> 06:00:08.631]  Totally disgusting.
[06:00:08.771 --> 06:00:09.292]  Exactly.
[06:00:09.312 --> 06:00:10.312]  That is Mr. Moneybags.
[06:00:10.332 --> 06:00:11.032]  He's here somewhere.
[06:00:11.412 --> 06:00:19.155]  So we're going to go to a short break and we'll be back with Leanne McAdoo in our Situation Room on the other side of Central Texas Command Center.
[06:00:19.175 --> 06:00:21.715]  This has been Rob Due, Joe Biggs, Darren McGreen was here earlier.
[06:00:21.996 --> 06:00:22.616]  Thanks for watching.
[06:00:22.656 --> 06:00:26.357]  Don't forget, go to Infowarslife.com or Infowarsstore.com.
[06:00:26.657 --> 06:00:29.478]  We have 25% off Brain Force, plus you get free shipping.
[06:00:29.878 --> 06:00:32.159]  We got Hillary for Prison t-shirts at cost.
[06:00:33.679 --> 06:00:37.841]  9.95.
[06:00:33.960 --> 06:00:37.841]  We also have Living Defenses now back and, like I said, free shipping.
[06:00:38.041 --> 06:00:40.843]  So, that's the way you can fund us.
[06:00:40.863 --> 06:00:44.024]  That's why we're able to stay on the air for 13 hours at a time.
[06:00:44.324 --> 06:00:45.405]  We've got to keep the crew fed.
[06:00:45.425 --> 06:00:46.265]  We need more crew.
[06:00:46.285 --> 06:00:47.846]  We're going to work this crew ragged tonight.
[06:00:47.866 --> 06:00:51.468]  I'm about to go join them and work on the train.
[06:00:51.488 --> 06:00:52.988]  We did get a little bit of barbecue today.
[06:00:53.008 --> 06:00:53.469]  That was good.
[06:00:54.509 --> 06:00:56.231]  Please, we thank you for your support.
[06:00:56.752 --> 06:00:57.332]  Spread the link.
[06:00:57.392 --> 06:00:58.834]  Inforest.com forward slash show.
[06:00:58.894 --> 06:00:59.655]  Get the free app.
[06:00:59.735 --> 06:01:00.716]  Spread the link to the app.
[06:01:00.776 --> 06:01:02.377]  Inforest.com forward slash app.
[06:01:02.678 --> 06:01:03.339]  Don't stop.
[06:01:03.959 --> 06:01:06.622]  And we got more news, more special reports coming up.
[06:01:07.102 --> 06:01:09.165]  It's just going to keep on going on until midnight.
[06:01:09.305 --> 06:01:14.710]  So, and Michael Zimmerman's now in the house after staying up all night editing the Haiti documentary.
[06:01:14.731 --> 06:01:15.852]  Joe Biggs, you got anything else to add?
[06:01:16.252 --> 06:01:17.573]  Hey, go check out the Haiti video.
[06:01:17.613 --> 06:01:19.856]  It's already got like 15,000 views within an hour.
[06:01:19.876 --> 06:01:21.978]  This is highly important information.
[06:01:22.338 --> 06:01:23.279]  These people are starving.
[06:01:23.299 --> 06:01:23.940]  They need your help.
[06:01:24.780 --> 06:01:33.068]  It's amazing to see how corrupt the Hillary Clinton family is and how corrupt CGI is, which is the Clinton Global Initiative and the Clinton Foundation.
[06:01:33.128 --> 06:01:34.910]  There's people out there risking their lives.
[06:01:35.371 --> 06:01:37.973]  A crew died yesterday flying a plane.
[06:01:38.233 --> 06:01:38.694]  Yeah, crashed.
[06:01:38.894 --> 06:01:40.195]  Crash into the ocean, they died.
[06:01:40.215 --> 06:01:42.416]  I got information from Gary late last night on that.
[06:01:42.916 --> 06:01:47.799]  So it is not safe being out there, but people are risking their lives to help these people out.
[06:01:47.859 --> 06:01:53.863]  And you have governments around the world worth billions of dollars, trillions of dollars, who aren't doing a damn thing.
[06:01:53.883 --> 06:01:56.565]  And that's including the Haitian government and the UN as well.
[06:01:56.965 --> 06:02:01.908]  And you had the Clintons that raised billions of dollars to give to Haiti and hardly gave anything, 2%.
[06:02:02.128 --> 06:02:03.489]  Most of it was lip service.
[06:02:03.509 --> 06:02:05.090]  They planted a tree on Earth Day.
[06:02:05.330 --> 06:02:05.510]  Yeah.
[06:02:05.750 --> 06:02:06.891]  For some kids, that's what they did.
[06:02:07.031 --> 06:02:07.651]  I'm sure that helped.
[06:02:07.711 --> 06:02:09.852]  I'm sure it's blown away now that the hurricane's gone through.
[06:02:10.133 --> 06:02:16.376]  So, by them stealing this money, it didn't allow them to build any infrastructure, so when this hurricane hit, they weren't able to fend for themselves.
[06:02:16.676 --> 06:02:18.677]  We have to raise people up so they can take care of themselves.
[06:02:18.697 --> 06:02:19.938]  You have to teach people how to fish.
[06:02:20.198 --> 06:02:21.499]  We have to stop giving people fish.
[06:02:21.859 --> 06:02:28.582]  That's the way we're going to make the world and this planet a better place for all people, when we teach people how to take care of themselves.
[06:02:29.063 --> 06:02:33.105]  But, part of that is help, you know, taking care of people while they can't take care of themselves.
[06:02:33.505 --> 06:02:37.827]  So, until we all reach to that plateau, we're still gonna be working here at InfoWars.com.
[06:02:38.167 --> 06:02:39.087]  You can bet on it.
[06:02:39.327 --> 06:02:45.110]  So join us tonight, keep watching, spread the link InfoWars.com forward slash show, InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[06:02:45.170 --> 06:02:45.830]  Let's roll the break.
[06:02:47.470 --> 06:02:51.792]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[06:02:52.112 --> 06:02:54.273]  Americanism, not globalism!
[06:02:54.413 --> 06:02:56.414]  Americanism, not globalism!
[06:02:58.032 --> 06:03:02.394]  Get Brain Force at 25% off for a limited time at Infowarslife.com.
[06:03:02.514 --> 06:03:04.695]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[06:03:04.815 --> 06:03:11.637]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[06:03:11.857 --> 06:03:15.099]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[06:03:15.119 --> 06:03:16.319]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[06:03:16.619 --> 06:03:18.460]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[06:03:18.780 --> 06:03:24.042]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do, this is sustainable.
[06:03:24.182 --> 06:03:28.163]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[06:03:28.383 --> 06:03:31.564]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[06:03:31.584 --> 06:03:34.665]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[06:03:34.685 --> 06:03:36.165]  We're looking at the television screen.
[06:03:36.205 --> 06:03:41.927]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[06:03:41.947 --> 06:03:43.267]  You will find brain force.
[06:03:43.607 --> 06:03:48.429]  Look, I'm not going to sit here and say, see I told you so, that communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[06:03:48.549 --> 06:03:49.929]  Because it's already here.
[06:03:50.069 --> 06:03:50.709]  It's been announced.
[06:03:50.729 --> 06:03:54.030]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[06:04:10.075 --> 06:04:11.957]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[06:04:12.118 --> 06:04:13.679]  A new battleship in the fight.
[06:04:13.859 --> 06:04:14.861]  InfoWars Live.
[06:04:15.041 --> 06:04:15.882]  Available right now.
[06:04:16.142 --> 06:04:17.483]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[06:04:17.944 --> 06:04:20.327]  You gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[06:04:21.047 --> 06:04:21.948]  Or you gonna be part of history?
[06:04:22.509 --> 06:04:25.492]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[06:04:26.013 --> 06:04:26.594]  Take action!
[06:04:27.552 --> 06:04:34.657]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[06:04:35.038 --> 06:04:48.247]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[06:04:49.188 --> 06:05:00.415]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[06:05:01.075 --> 06:05:07.039]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[06:05:07.799 --> 06:05:16.189]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[06:05:16.809 --> 06:05:25.019]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[06:05:43.694 --> 06:05:46.156]  All right, and welcome back to InfoWars.
[06:05:46.256 --> 06:05:50.479]  This is our epic 13-hour coverage of the last presidential debate.
[06:05:50.559 --> 06:05:57.044]  It's the final showdown, Trump versus Hillary, or as we like to say, freedom versus tyranny.
[06:05:57.404 --> 06:06:00.207]  Now we have a jam-packed couple of hours for you.
[06:06:00.587 --> 06:06:02.609]  Owen Schroyer is joining me in studio now.
[06:06:03.149 --> 06:06:04.130]  We're going to play you
[06:06:05.831 --> 06:06:09.472]  An exclusive little piece from Nigel Farage coming up.
[06:06:09.512 --> 06:06:11.993]  David Knight, of course, is on the ground there in Vegas.
[06:06:12.513 --> 06:06:14.314]  He'll be joining us about 6.30.
[06:06:15.214 --> 06:06:17.615]  And also Margaret Howell will be joining me in studio.
[06:06:17.635 --> 06:06:19.696]  I'm going to be talking with Jack Posobiec.
[06:06:19.736 --> 06:06:22.717]  He's the Special Projects Director of Citizens for Trump.
[06:06:23.257 --> 06:06:29.982]  We're going to talk about some of the internal pollings and also what some cyber security experts are saying about WikiLeaks.
[06:06:30.062 --> 06:06:31.543]  They're kind of on the inside.
[06:06:31.623 --> 06:06:33.504]  So, jam-packed show for you guys.
[06:06:33.564 --> 06:06:34.705]  Thank you for sticking with us.
[06:06:34.745 --> 06:06:41.610]  Be sure and share this link infowars.com forward slash show or infowars.com forward slash app.
[06:06:41.950 --> 06:06:43.671]  Let all your friends know that we will be here.
[06:06:43.691 --> 06:06:47.654]  We're about, what, halfway through our 13-hour broadcast.
[06:06:47.714 --> 06:06:48.175]  Of course, the
[06:06:49.255 --> 06:06:58.162]  13 hours is a little subliminal message to Hillary Clinton and her crew who of course is watching our show with bated breath but Owen now
[06:06:59.204 --> 06:07:11.173]  Owen, when I was, you know, growing up, putting my wishes and my intentions out there, you know, praying to God at night for my plans, you know, I wanted to be on the front lines of the Info War.
[06:07:11.253 --> 06:07:14.275]  I wanted to be right here where I'm at right now.
[06:07:15.296 --> 06:07:22.801]  Never in my wildest dreams, though, did I think or imagine that we would literally be on the front lines of this presidential election.
[06:07:23.262 --> 06:07:26.244]  Such an epic time where we truly are battling evil.
[06:07:26.732 --> 06:07:51.656]  Well the crazy thing is, in the last probably six months to a year, we've seen InfoWars go from the lead and the alternative media, now to the point that Hillary Clinton is addressing Alex Jones in speeches, Obama's addressing Alex Jones in speeches, they're running ads that are specifically catered to try to divert the message that we make.
[06:07:52.356 --> 06:08:09.989]  Um, so it's gone beyond just us talking to the people out there, the people tuning in, but now we've got political campaigns listening and I think the Clinton campaign is doing everything they can to try to buck the messages that we're putting out or disprove or make us look bad, whatever it is.
[06:08:10.509 --> 06:08:11.349]  Unfortunately,
[06:08:12.150 --> 06:08:16.692]  Because of the Barbra Streisand effect, which I'm not sure... I mean, they're probably listening.
[06:08:16.712 --> 06:08:25.197]  I don't want to let the cat out of the bag here, but thanks to the Barbra Streisand effect, people like Hillary Clinton and Rachel Madcow have helped us grow.
[06:08:25.597 --> 06:08:26.878]  I've been actually paying attention.
[06:08:26.898 --> 06:08:28.478]  Pitching our products on their show.
[06:08:28.538 --> 06:08:28.759]  Right!
[06:08:28.799 --> 06:08:29.559]  Pitching our products.
[06:08:29.959 --> 06:08:32.420]  Thank you for that free plug, Rachel Madcow.
[06:08:33.281 --> 06:08:36.282]  But it's wild because I've been watching these subscribers.
[06:08:36.323 --> 06:08:38.364]  When I subscribed to Alex Jones,
[06:08:39.284 --> 06:08:42.467]  About four years ago, they were probably right at just over a million.
[06:08:43.088 --> 06:08:48.032]  And then for about three years, they maybe went up about to like 1.2 million.
[06:08:48.453 --> 06:08:52.497]  But in the last six months to a year, they've gone up almost half a million.
[06:08:52.957 --> 06:08:54.859]  So we've really expanded.
[06:08:55.119 --> 06:08:58.142]  And as Rob was talking about, it's thanks to the supporters out there.
[06:08:58.182 --> 06:08:58.843]  Thanks to the listeners.
[06:08:58.883 --> 06:09:01.085]  Thanks to the people who go to InfoWars.com slash show.
[06:09:01.735 --> 06:09:07.898]  Well, I know, and also too, you know, I think that truly YouTube was suppressing our views, suppressing our likes.
[06:09:08.479 --> 06:09:19.664]  Absolutely, because we've seen just the view count skyrocket in the last few months, and so that's really amazing to see, but thanks to everybody out there that's helping us to be on the front lines of the info war.
[06:09:19.704 --> 06:09:21.545]  This is all thanks to all of you out there.
[06:09:21.605 --> 06:09:23.086]  I mean, it is incredible.
[06:09:23.186 --> 06:09:25.207]  Everyone out there should be truly proud.
[06:09:25.267 --> 06:09:28.149]  I mean, you hear that saying, what a time to be alive, but
[06:09:29.129 --> 06:09:36.875]  We, this is the time to be alive, and I can't imagine that we are right there getting name-dropped by Hillary Clinton and President Obama.
[06:09:36.956 --> 06:09:38.277]  I mean, whoo!
[06:09:38.537 --> 06:09:43.581]  Sends a little shivers, like I feel the energy from the world all eyes on us, so it's pretty exciting.
[06:09:43.821 --> 06:09:48.985]  Yeah, we were talking about that earlier, how just feeling the energy from planet Earth right now and everything that's happening.
[06:09:49.045 --> 06:09:50.686]  It's really empowering, to be honest.
[06:09:50.746 --> 06:09:51.487]  It'll give you chills.
[06:09:51.867 --> 06:09:52.688]  But you know, it's crazy.
[06:09:52.728 --> 06:09:54.449]  You talk about this, how we're growing.
[06:09:55.490 --> 06:09:58.853]  And, you know, I'm not going to sit here and act like I know everything.
[06:09:58.993 --> 06:10:01.535]  I'm not going to sit here and act like I'm right all the time.
[06:10:01.555 --> 06:10:05.658]  I know that CNN, Fox News, those people aren't right all the time.
[06:10:06.159 --> 06:10:07.680]  But we're trying, okay?
[06:10:07.900 --> 06:10:10.042]  I don't get filtered by Alex Jones.
[06:10:10.222 --> 06:10:11.863]  I don't get filtered by Leanne.
[06:10:11.883 --> 06:10:13.224]  I don't get filtered by Rob Due.
[06:10:13.284 --> 06:10:19.709]  We're all here as essentially independent journalists or investigators just trying to figure out what the hell's going on.
[06:10:19.789 --> 06:10:21.571]  Trying to work with you to figure out what the hell's going on.
[06:10:21.591 --> 06:10:24.213]  I mean, this is a crazy planet, but Leanne, you know what people are saying.
[06:10:24.693 --> 06:10:29.675]  They're saying that the next presidential debate is going to be moderated by Alex Jones.
[06:10:29.755 --> 06:10:32.296]  What do you think about the prospects of that?
[06:10:32.697 --> 06:10:34.197]  I think that would be excellent.
[06:10:34.237 --> 06:10:37.779]  Now we've just got to train Alex not to interrupt people when they're talking.
[06:10:37.839 --> 06:10:39.480]  Oh boy, that might be impossible.
[06:10:39.520 --> 06:10:39.840]  I don't know.
[06:10:40.762 --> 06:10:45.908]  Well, you know, I kind of want to draw attention to that too, just the energy that's surrounding this.
[06:10:46.409 --> 06:10:49.332]  I mean, people are rightly confused.
[06:10:49.613 --> 06:10:58.924]  And I think the reason why, we know this, and a lot of people out there understand that there's kind of a huge sigh up and you've got to shut off the news because it's all propaganda, blah blah blah.
[06:10:59.665 --> 06:11:03.126]  We didn't really quite get the depths of this.
[06:11:03.326 --> 06:11:05.147]  Alex is always saying, you have no idea.
[06:11:05.187 --> 06:11:06.327]  It's worse than you can imagine.
[06:11:06.367 --> 06:11:07.688]  You know, I've seen the documents.
[06:11:07.748 --> 06:11:08.528]  I've got the papers.
[06:11:09.088 --> 06:11:14.990]  But now, thanks to WikiLeaks, we can actually see just how deep the corruption goes.
[06:11:15.050 --> 06:11:16.311]  And it is so dark.
[06:11:16.351 --> 06:11:18.272]  I mean, this stuff is it's insane.
[06:11:18.692 --> 06:11:21.353]  The amount of collusion from every single level.
[06:11:21.393 --> 06:11:27.935]  We've got the media, you know, Hollywood there at the different levels and branches of government on both the right and the left.
[06:11:28.175 --> 06:11:28.995]  We're good to go.
[06:11:47.421 --> 06:11:47.621]  I don't
[06:12:07.575 --> 06:12:09.776]  You know, quiet or subtle about it anymore.
[06:12:09.816 --> 06:12:15.539]  They're straight up telling you, you know, there's got to be some way that we can curate the information that you're allowed to access.
[06:12:15.619 --> 06:12:23.782]  Obama kind of waxing poetic about the days when there was only three main news media outlets and that's how everyone got their information.
[06:12:23.822 --> 06:12:25.083]  We need to go back to those days.
[06:12:25.363 --> 06:12:26.343]  Simpler times.
[06:12:26.443 --> 06:12:27.604]  It was easier to control you.
[06:12:28.024 --> 06:12:30.605]  Yeah, and I got a newsflash for Barack Obama.
[06:12:30.625 --> 06:12:33.525]  This is the Wild West, okay?
[06:12:33.885 --> 06:12:34.705]  This is America.
[06:12:34.905 --> 06:12:36.286]  This is the gateway to the West.
[06:12:36.326 --> 06:12:37.126]  This is freedom.
[06:12:37.166 --> 06:12:39.266]  This is the last bastion of freedom on planet Earth.
[06:12:39.666 --> 06:12:43.387]  So if you don't like the Wild Wild West, you can go ahead and shuffle off to North Korea.
[06:12:44.187 --> 06:12:47.308]  Europe is kind of bringing in a nice little socialist structure there.
[06:12:47.348 --> 06:12:48.528]  That's not working well for them.
[06:12:48.548 --> 06:12:50.769]  But you can go ahead and shuffle over there and control the news.
[06:12:50.809 --> 06:12:52.109]  This is the Wild Wild West.
[06:12:52.369 --> 06:12:54.650]  And personally, that's how I like it.
[06:12:54.750 --> 06:12:56.270]  That's what freedom is all about.
[06:12:56.630 --> 06:12:58.412]  Dangerous freedom, give it to me, baby!
[06:12:58.752 --> 06:13:03.916]  Right, it's like if you like the model that are set up in all these other countries, why don't you just go there and live?
[06:13:03.936 --> 06:13:08.700]  Like, why would you turn this beautiful country into a communist dictatorship?
[06:13:08.740 --> 06:13:10.762]  But I just don't understand it, why evil?
[06:13:10.782 --> 06:13:22.992]  It's like they can never have enough, but just like the power structure, they can never have enough land, enough resources, enough money, and this and that, and they've got to get rid of the people who are beginning to awaken.
[06:13:23.932 --> 06:13:34.455]  So here's something I woke up to today, and I'm trying to train myself to not look at my phone for at least 30 minutes when I wake up, but it's almost impossible to do.
[06:13:34.635 --> 06:13:38.616]  All of us here did not get any sleep last night because it's the energy in the air.
[06:13:39.316 --> 06:13:40.596]  It wasn't even worrying about today.
[06:13:40.616 --> 06:13:42.577]  It was just like, man, there's just so much energy.
[06:13:43.317 --> 06:13:50.301]  But so Marco Rubio, okay, warning the GOP to stay silent on the WikiLeaks hack.
[06:13:50.841 --> 06:14:01.727]  So here he is, he's kind of parading himself out as he's going to take the high ground and he says, I will not discuss any issue that has become public solely on the basis of WikiLeaks.
[06:14:02.348 --> 06:14:09.812]  As our intelligence agencies have said, these leaks are an effort by a foreign government to interfere with our electoral process and I will not indulge it.
[06:14:10.552 --> 06:14:17.156]  And then he goes on to say, further, I want to warn my fellow Republicans who may want to capitalize politically on these leaks.
[06:14:17.657 --> 06:14:19.117]  Today, it's the Democrats.
[06:14:19.478 --> 06:14:21.099]  Tomorrow, it could be us.
[06:14:22.039 --> 06:14:27.763]  And, you know, basically going on to say these foreign leaders could be blackmailing them for anything that they might find in their emails.
[06:14:28.403 --> 06:14:36.569]  Dude, if Wikileaks is going to expose corruption on either side of the aisle like they've done for us now with our current electoral process,
[06:14:37.769 --> 06:14:38.450]  I'm all for it.
[06:14:38.690 --> 06:14:44.773]  I mean, weren't they just pushing a few years ago when Edward Snowden's revelations came about?
[06:14:45.154 --> 06:14:47.075]  They were really trying to push on the American people.
[06:14:47.115 --> 06:14:48.896]  Hey, you've got nothing to hide.
[06:14:49.276 --> 06:14:51.017]  What are you worried about getting spied on?
[06:14:51.177 --> 06:14:53.378]  Why do you care if the NSA is looking at your emails?
[06:14:53.799 --> 06:14:54.779]  You got nothing to hide.
[06:14:55.580 --> 06:15:00.563]  But now they see that their political power doesn't draw the line.
[06:15:01.345 --> 06:15:03.366]  Wait, is that Lil Marco?
[06:15:03.906 --> 06:15:05.526]  Lil Marco Rubio?
[06:15:05.566 --> 06:15:06.507]  We're talking about Lil Marco?
[06:15:06.847 --> 06:15:09.648]  And did he just admit that he's scared of getting hacked?
[06:15:09.668 --> 06:15:13.749]  So I guess he's admitting that he's got things in his email that he doesn't want to get out there.
[06:15:13.769 --> 06:15:13.969]  Of course!
[06:15:13.989 --> 06:15:15.269]  But here's the thing about... Well, bubble baths!
[06:15:15.449 --> 06:15:16.230]  But phone parties!
[06:15:17.415 --> 06:15:21.942]  We've seen the pictures of Little Marco enjoying himself at a bubble bath party, but that's none of my business.
[06:15:22.443 --> 06:15:32.639]  But it's weird to me if these emails are fraudulent or WikiLeaks is not, you know, a credible organization, why wouldn't you want to address it face on?
[06:15:33.119 --> 06:15:39.964]  Why wouldn't you want to take them on, head on, and say, look, you're fabricating these emails, you know, we can prove it.
[06:15:40.084 --> 06:15:41.325]  We'll release our emails.
[06:15:41.365 --> 06:15:44.227]  Yeah, we'll go through and all, you can look at all our servers, but no.
[06:15:44.247 --> 06:15:44.928]  They can't.
[06:15:44.988 --> 06:15:49.671]  The fact that they're silent on this, I think is a cry of guilt.
[06:15:50.092 --> 06:15:50.832]  Absolutely.
[06:15:50.872 --> 06:15:53.634]  And that's why they don't want you to look at this stuff, because it's real.
[06:15:53.694 --> 06:16:00.079]  They want to divert your attention from what's really going on, and then they'll probably try to intimidate you like Marco Rubio, little Marco saying,
[06:16:00.579 --> 06:16:03.303]  Oh, well, I don't want them coming into my email or your email.
[06:16:03.624 --> 06:16:05.506]  Or, oh, this is illegal, like CNN.
[06:16:05.767 --> 06:16:07.369]  It's illegal to look at these emails.
[06:16:07.509 --> 06:16:07.950]  Completely illegal.
[06:16:07.970 --> 06:16:08.150]  It's not.
[06:16:08.831 --> 06:16:14.619]  Well, yeah, I mean, and that's the threat that he is issuing to his GOP members is that
[06:16:15.945 --> 06:16:35.010]  Someone might get in there and try to blackmail you for whatever you have that's embarrassing or you know try to embarrass your wife or kids or whatever and yeah of course that's very scary and that's why the rest of American citizens are like I don't want to put all my information to where you can easily access it or it can be hacked into like all of our medical records etc etc but they
[06:16:35.550 --> 06:16:48.417]  They want to convince us that it's okay to give up our sovereignty and our right to privacy, but once it finally has come home to roost, they realize, wow, and don't think it's just on the Democratic side that all of this corruption is going.
[06:16:48.477 --> 06:16:55.721]  Now, we know that the Democratic Party is the one that has been infiltrated long ago to push these really progressive, super progressive agenda.
[06:16:55.741 --> 06:17:00.603]  They want to change the entire fabric of what this country is to turn it into a
[06:17:01.684 --> 06:17:06.466]  Some type of a totalitarian government, some type of a socialist or communist dictatorship.
[06:17:07.167 --> 06:17:11.229]  They want all the power to rest with the state, not with the people.
[06:17:11.749 --> 06:17:23.815]  Either way, it's going to majorly transform this country, this nation, and that's why they are shaking in their boots that there could possibly someone come up that the people themselves want to be put in power.
[06:17:24.355 --> 06:17:25.376]  Well, and think about this.
[06:17:26.056 --> 06:17:29.299]  WikiLeaks released another 1,800 emails today.
[06:17:29.519 --> 06:17:31.220]  Podesta emailed dump number 12.
[06:17:32.181 --> 06:17:33.742]  The total is now almost 20,000.
[06:17:34.502 --> 06:17:38.605]  So, this is a daily routine, folks, okay?
[06:17:38.645 --> 06:17:40.006]  There's so much corruption.
[06:17:40.046 --> 06:17:41.728]  There's so many emails that have been hacked.
[06:17:42.248 --> 06:17:46.832]  from Democratic Party operatives that it's now a daily ceremony.
[06:17:47.013 --> 06:17:49.835]  Wake up and see what the latest WikiLeaks dumps is.
[06:17:50.536 --> 06:17:54.660]  I salute you, Julian Assange, even though we have had trolling history together.
[06:17:55.120 --> 06:17:57.823]  But it's just amazing that there's so much corruption.
[06:17:57.863 --> 06:17:58.443]  It's daily now.
[06:17:58.523 --> 06:18:06.390]  And then to me, another thing that's kind of waking up, and I don't know if you're experiencing this, but me personally, and maybe I need to take my tinfoil hat off here, but
[06:18:07.225 --> 06:18:17.496]  It exposes the electronic grid that we're on that, I mean, anything, anything you do on, on your little imperial probe droid here, your cell phone, your computer, whatever it is,
[06:18:18.504 --> 06:18:21.266]  It goes on the record forever.
[06:18:21.426 --> 06:18:21.646]  Right.
[06:18:21.706 --> 06:18:23.207]  Somebody has that data.
[06:18:23.287 --> 06:18:25.709]  Somebody can pull that somewhere, somehow.
[06:18:26.209 --> 06:18:38.077]  And I'm coming to a point now, and I've said this to some of my friends, it's like, I mean, I don't want to be sending stuff over text and email that somebody might pull up later and call me a racist or a homophobe or, you know, who knows?
[06:18:38.097 --> 06:18:42.120]  I mean, obviously you could hack into my email now and there's not gonna be anything damning against me.
[06:18:42.160 --> 06:18:45.682]  But the point is, I think that... Lots of inappropriate sex jokes.
[06:18:45.722 --> 06:18:47.724]  But me, but me as an American, I'm saying,
[06:18:48.924 --> 06:18:51.025]  I realize now that it's palpable.
[06:18:51.085 --> 06:18:59.508]  Everything I put down on electronic paper essentially is trackable, traceable, and if somebody wants to expose that, they will.
[06:18:59.528 --> 06:19:00.088]  Right.
[06:19:00.108 --> 06:19:03.629]  So this is kind of a weird, it's like a weird dynamic here where
[06:19:04.921 --> 06:19:09.062]  Now are we going to start censoring ourselves on our private electronic devices?
[06:19:09.282 --> 06:19:10.883]  And you know, the other thing is, too, think about this.
[06:19:11.503 --> 06:19:12.944]  So we're getting all of these emails.
[06:19:13.464 --> 06:19:15.324]  These people are well aware we can hack their email.
[06:19:15.364 --> 06:19:16.345]  They've known this for a while.
[06:19:16.445 --> 06:19:19.966]  Think about what they're saying outside of these emails.
[06:19:19.986 --> 06:19:23.087]  Think about what they're saying on phone calls, in conversations.
[06:19:23.587 --> 06:19:28.528]  Think about the fact that this is just one person, John Podesta, who has been hacked into.
[06:19:28.549 --> 06:19:38.611]  Now obviously there's some other emails that he's talking back and forth with other people, but this is just one person in the government, and we're finding out so much stuff.
[06:19:38.691 --> 06:19:39.792]  Here's a perfect example.
[06:19:40.752 --> 06:19:45.454]  About how corrupt it is and how they are working together behind the scenes.
[06:19:45.874 --> 06:19:47.055]  And they're all working together.
[06:19:47.075 --> 06:19:50.516]  So here we have an email thread dated September 26, 2015.
[06:19:51.217 --> 06:19:56.499]  This is between Hillary Clinton and her senior policy advisor, Anne O'Leary.
[06:19:57.159 --> 06:20:00.721]  And it's titled, Memo on Cadillac Tax for HRC.
[06:20:01.481 --> 06:20:19.870]  So, this is where they're talking about the Affordable Care Act, and you know, out in front of the public, Obamacare is great, it's wonderful, this is going to be great for the country, you know, but behind the scenes, they were already knowing that it was going to be unraveled, but they wanted to sell it to us,
[06:20:20.430 --> 06:20:25.074]  And think about how much money they have made off of Obamacare penalties.
[06:20:25.174 --> 06:20:29.017]  I think, what was it, in the billions this last year of people paying the penalty?
[06:20:29.580 --> 06:20:31.181]  And they've got lawsuits coming out, too.
[06:20:31.422 --> 06:20:34.384]  So here it is on the record, just this email coming out.
[06:20:34.484 --> 06:20:37.607]  It's going to haunt you forever if the freaking media would ever report on it.
[06:20:38.167 --> 06:20:46.914]  So Hillary writes, given the politics now with bipartisan support, including Schumer, all support repeal with sense of the Senate that revenues would have to be found.
[06:20:47.034 --> 06:20:48.455]  I'd be open to a range of options.
[06:20:48.896 --> 06:20:56.102]  But we have to be careful that the Republican version passes, which begins the unraveling of the Affordable Care Act.
[06:20:56.522 --> 06:21:01.009]  So they were already planning on the unraveling of the Affordable Care Act.
[06:21:01.049 --> 06:21:01.890]  They know it's coming.
[06:21:01.930 --> 06:21:03.012]  They're not trying to prop it up.
[06:21:03.052 --> 06:21:04.374]  She's not going to try and fight for it.
[06:21:04.674 --> 06:21:07.819]  But she wants to make sure it's the Republican version, that that can get the ball rolling.
[06:21:07.859 --> 06:21:11.465]  That way it can be blamed on the Republicans if it's a disaster at the beginning.
[06:21:12.446 --> 06:21:17.512]  But they all are pushing to usher in a plan that's going to be much, much worse.
[06:21:17.792 --> 06:21:19.354]  And this is on both sides of the aisle.
[06:21:19.414 --> 06:21:22.718]  It drives me crazy that they lie to us so much.
[06:21:22.758 --> 06:21:29.225]  No wonder everyone is getting freaking headaches and sickness this election cycle, because there's a huge psyop being run on everyone.
[06:21:29.485 --> 06:21:39.537]  And that's the key right there is that they want it to fail so that they can bring in something more overreaching, more tyrannical, more control.
[06:21:39.637 --> 06:21:40.798]  That is the key here.
[06:21:40.858 --> 06:21:46.045]  So most people will see this and we hope most people see this and you know on the surface say
[06:21:46.585 --> 06:21:57.173]  Okay, wow, here's some rhetoric from Hillary Clinton and her campaign that shows that she has a double standard, a public opinion, a private opinion, and you know what, maybe she doesn't think too much about the ACA.
[06:21:57.614 --> 06:22:07.221]  But the deeper, underlining thing here that you just mentioned is that they want it to fail, so that every time it fails, they bring in something with more control, more demands, more power.
[06:22:07.561 --> 06:22:11.883]  But they're going to totally spin it when they do unravel Obamacare.
[06:22:11.943 --> 06:22:19.866]  They're going to completely spin it as some sort of a victory for the American people who want to repeal this, who want to, oh yay, good, you know, we won.
[06:22:20.266 --> 06:22:26.429]  The plan all along, as proven by this email, on both sides of the aisle, is to let this thing unravel.
[06:22:26.449 --> 06:22:33.351]  They knew it was going to be a disaster, yet they gobbled up all of this money in taxpayer dollars, completely swindled the system.
[06:22:33.371 --> 06:22:34.512]  That's why we have all the big
[06:22:35.072 --> 06:22:36.656]  Insurance carriers pulling out.
[06:22:36.756 --> 06:22:37.778]  They know something's coming.
[06:22:37.798 --> 06:22:39.822]  They're like, no, we're not gonna play this game anymore.
[06:22:40.183 --> 06:22:41.666]  We're losing tons of money from this.
[06:22:41.706 --> 06:22:42.668]  It's a total joke.
[06:22:43.189 --> 06:22:45.775]  And then we have Donald Trump putting something out there that...
[06:22:46.844 --> 06:22:53.085]  Uh, separates the state lines so that the insurance companies are able to compete across state lines, which would make it more fair.
[06:22:53.145 --> 06:22:59.047]  You know, there's obviously some things about the Affordable Care Act that are great, like allowing people across the board to get coverage.
[06:22:59.067 --> 06:23:01.107]  Um, but you know, this just doesn't work.
[06:23:01.187 --> 06:23:05.808]  But Hillary Clinton's plan is to usher in single payer, something much, much worse.
[06:23:05.908 --> 06:23:08.789]  Again, all of the power to the government.
[06:23:09.375 --> 06:23:10.056]  None to the people.
[06:23:10.316 --> 06:23:22.271]  Personally, I liked Ben Carson's plan where you basically have your own private account that you're paying into your whole life, your whole family, and that's kind of where you draw your funds for your medical care.
[06:23:22.291 --> 06:23:25.315]  Essentially, that's what I'm doing because I just keep taking the hit.
[06:23:25.515 --> 06:23:28.558]  And it's pretty American to me as far as the structure of it.
[06:23:28.598 --> 06:23:37.045]  But, you know, the incredible thing to me is thinking about Obamacare is that Hillary Clinton tried to push for her own health care years and years ago.
[06:23:37.125 --> 06:23:43.250]  People from inside Secret Service and the Clinton campaign have talked about that, how it was a failed thing even when she tried it years ago.
[06:23:43.670 --> 06:23:44.931]  But this is how this works to me.
[06:23:45.936 --> 06:23:48.778]  Who wants this Affordable Care Act?
[06:23:48.798 --> 06:23:57.024]  Who wants the government to be working with insurance companies to force us to buy insurance through the government?
[06:23:57.064 --> 06:23:57.765]  Well, it's obvious.
[06:23:57.925 --> 06:24:09.654]  It's the insurance companies and the bankers who make the money off this, who work together to have these massive insurance plans, and then they fund the candidates who push it down our throats.
[06:24:10.054 --> 06:24:13.416]  So here's the thing, when you're Hillary Clinton, how do you get money?
[06:24:13.716 --> 06:24:18.198]  You get money from donors, and you get money, I guess, when you essentially win office.
[06:24:18.298 --> 06:24:19.159]  And how do you win office?
[06:24:19.319 --> 06:24:20.539]  Getting more money from donors.
[06:24:20.839 --> 06:24:22.260]  So she just works for these donors.
[06:24:22.520 --> 06:24:26.282]  She doesn't want insurance to pass so that you can be insured.
[06:24:26.522 --> 06:24:30.644]  She wants this stuff to pass so that the people who fund her are happy.
[06:24:31.024 --> 06:24:34.166]  That's how the politicians work, and that's what Donald Trump is against.
[06:24:34.446 --> 06:24:34.646]  Right.
[06:24:34.786 --> 06:24:46.990]  And she said as much in her Goldman Sachs speeches that she didn't want to release to the public, but they were, you know, released anyway, because if you've got nothing to hide, then you shouldn't be worried about it, Hillary Clinton and everyone else out there.
[06:24:47.730 --> 06:24:53.912]  But she says, you know, the people who need to regulate the industry are the people that we're trying to regulate themselves.
[06:24:54.152 --> 06:24:59.014]  The Wall Street bankers, you know the most about this industry, so you guys should regulate yourselves.
[06:24:59.534 --> 06:25:02.895]  It seems like that's what they do a lot, is they investigate themselves
[06:25:02.995 --> 06:25:07.138]  Because we've done an internal investigation and we found no wrongdoing.
[06:25:07.158 --> 06:25:09.360]  I mean, that's what they would just like to see across the board.
[06:25:09.420 --> 06:25:11.782]  It's like a sick joke.
[06:25:11.842 --> 06:25:14.124]  I mean, what planet are we living on?
[06:25:14.144 --> 06:25:17.707]  This makes me look at this WikiLeaks email.
[06:25:17.847 --> 06:25:28.656]  One of Hillary Clinton's, one of her confidants, longtime confidant, Neera Tanden, is actually complaining that, to John Podesta, she doesn't think Hillary Clinton knows what planet she's on.
[06:25:29.196 --> 06:25:34.922]  Well, there was another email leak from Hillary Clinton saying, I've lost touch with regular American people.
[06:25:35.002 --> 06:25:36.003]  I've lost touch with the real world.
[06:25:36.023 --> 06:25:37.144]  We need to cut that out of the line.
[06:25:37.184 --> 06:25:38.525]  It doesn't seem authentic.
[06:25:38.725 --> 06:25:40.547]  And it's obvious.
[06:25:40.747 --> 06:25:45.552]  Hillary Clinton, this woman does not have a clue what the average American is going through.
[06:25:46.312 --> 06:25:50.496]  She has been stealing money, getting away with murder, getting away with rape.
[06:25:51.892 --> 06:25:53.132]  Parading around on planes.
[06:25:53.152 --> 06:25:55.353]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars to talk for five minutes.
[06:25:56.153 --> 06:26:04.994]  How is it, I mean, how is it I'm sitting here talking about a mass criminal and she is- The front runner for the presidency.
[06:26:05.014 --> 06:26:06.675]  The front runner for the president of my country?
[06:26:06.695 --> 06:26:11.435]  I mean, this shows you, and let's say everything, let's say all the allegations against Trump are true, okay?
[06:26:11.455 --> 06:26:13.156]  Let's say Trump is a terrible guy, okay?
[06:26:13.336 --> 06:26:20.997]  So we've come to this point where we've got Donald Trump, a racist, homophobe, misogynist, running against Hillary Clinton, one of the biggest
[06:26:21.357 --> 06:26:23.658]  Mafia, criminal dons in the history of the world.
[06:26:23.698 --> 06:26:24.298]  Well guess what?
[06:26:24.578 --> 06:26:31.079]  This is what happens when you care more about football and Kim Kardashian's butt for decades instead of what's going on in government.
[06:26:31.099 --> 06:26:32.480]  So this is what you got, alright?
[06:26:32.680 --> 06:26:47.603]  You better live with it and you better wake up and realize which candidate is going to emplace policies and implement policies that are pro-American and which candidate is going to implement policies that are pro-globalist and continue the deterioration of our society, our country, and our culture.
[06:26:47.904 --> 06:26:49.644]  That's what's on the line with this debate, Leigh-Anne.
[06:26:49.924 --> 06:26:50.484]  Absolutely.
[06:26:50.584 --> 06:26:51.665]  And that's very well said.
[06:26:51.685 --> 06:26:54.787]  And that's what, you know, I've kind of been getting in arguments with a lot of people.
[06:26:55.207 --> 06:27:00.911]  And you know what, everyone out there, don't allow this to tear up your friendships because a lot of people are really confused about this.
[06:27:00.951 --> 06:27:03.252]  You've got to have good debates with people.
[06:27:03.332 --> 06:27:12.497]  I know it's really frustrating to try to bang your head against a brick wall, which is what it's, you know, it kind of is how it feels sometimes when you're trying to speak to some people that are just going to vote for Hillary.
[06:27:12.898 --> 06:27:16.340]  Just because I don't, what I don't understand the argument I hear a lot is that
[06:27:16.840 --> 06:27:18.581]  Things could go bad with Trump.
[06:27:18.721 --> 06:27:19.602]  He could do this.
[06:27:19.682 --> 06:27:20.262]  He could do that.
[06:27:20.723 --> 06:27:22.444]  Hillary Clinton is a sure thing.
[06:27:22.864 --> 06:27:24.665]  She surely is a con man.
[06:27:24.745 --> 06:27:26.927]  She surely is going to sell out this country.
[06:27:27.007 --> 06:27:30.389]  We definitely are going to war if she gets in.
[06:27:30.809 --> 06:27:39.095]  So it's like people are so comfortable with the things that they know and they understand, but it's just it's really bizarre that the thing that they know and understand
[06:27:39.855 --> 06:27:50.841]  Is like being beaten in a torture chamber and so they don't want to leave it because that's what they know and it's like I know I'm going to get beat down and really tortured for the rest of my life but you know I don't know what's outside of that door.
[06:27:50.941 --> 06:27:51.702]  It could be freedom.
[06:27:51.922 --> 06:27:52.682]  It could be beautiful.
[06:27:52.702 --> 06:27:58.786]  It could be amazing but this is what I know is this evil and this corruption and it's it's just easier to stay right here with this like
[06:27:59.286 --> 06:28:03.788]  God, you gotta shake off that apathy, wake up, turn off the TV set.
[06:28:04.408 --> 06:28:05.468]  You know, unless you're what?
[06:28:05.628 --> 06:28:07.569]  Infowars.com forward slash app.
[06:28:07.789 --> 06:28:09.810]  That's how you can get your news if you want to.
[06:28:10.550 --> 06:28:17.953]  But yeah, I mean, this is really truly a corrupt house of cards that they are trying desperately to maintain.
[06:28:18.433 --> 06:28:31.164]  And I think what you'll find out is, once you do a little bit of investigation and research on your own, everything that you thought you knew or understood is what somebody else wanted you to think or understand.
[06:28:31.184 --> 06:28:36.688]  I know we got Jack coming up, I'm not sure, but I wanted to get into some of these questions I think should be asked tonight.
[06:28:36.708 --> 06:28:38.210]  Do we have time to do that before Jack's coming on?
[06:28:38.250 --> 06:28:38.950]  Yeah, sure.
[06:28:38.990 --> 06:28:42.233]  You guys let me know, just tell me in my ear whenever we get Jack on the line.
[06:28:42.253 --> 06:28:44.215]  I know he'll be Skyping in, but yeah, let's talk about
[06:28:45.015 --> 06:28:49.079]  What if it was a non-corrupt world that we were living in?
[06:28:49.539 --> 06:28:51.641]  What kind of questions would be good at the debate?
[06:28:52.062 --> 06:29:00.970]  Well, and obviously, you know, the caveat is the first two debates we saw were clearly leveled against Donald Trump.
[06:29:01.090 --> 06:29:02.371]  It was not even close.
[06:29:02.451 --> 06:29:07.156]  Honestly, it was a three-on-one, two-on-one, whoever was speaking against Donald Trump.
[06:29:07.196 --> 06:29:09.258]  And he still won, so good for him.
[06:29:11.039 --> 06:29:17.366]  And this is, look, these questions, I wrote them down, we're going to get to them, I'll see what you think, but this is non-partisan, okay?
[06:29:17.447 --> 06:29:29.060]  Obviously I'm for Trump, I'm not trying to hide that, but these are the questions that I would pose to the candidates from a non-partisan perspective to try to get a fair response out of the two candidates.
[06:29:29.360 --> 06:29:30.281]  I'd start with this, I'd say,
[06:29:30.922 --> 06:29:36.327]  Hillary, you have demonized Putin and the Obama administration is making relations with Russia more tense.
[06:29:36.747 --> 06:29:38.609]  What are your foreign policies to Russia?
[06:29:38.909 --> 06:29:39.249]  Bam!
[06:29:39.269 --> 06:29:40.290]  You get her answer.
[06:29:40.310 --> 06:29:40.971]  Then you go to Trump.
[06:29:40.991 --> 06:29:45.594]  You say, Trump, you have said you would visit with Putin before inauguration if you won.
[06:29:45.654 --> 06:29:46.195]  Why is that?
[06:29:46.415 --> 06:29:48.357]  Do you think we'll get either of those questions tonight?
[06:29:49.440 --> 06:29:50.060]  I am not sure.
[06:29:50.220 --> 06:29:56.004]  I'd like to know, is going into Syria, toppling Assad, is that worth going to war with Russia?
[06:29:56.204 --> 06:29:58.485]  I mean, are we going to even talk about that?
[06:29:58.906 --> 06:30:03.448]  They refuse to even acknowledge the fact that we are dangerously close to World War III.
[06:30:03.488 --> 06:30:04.549]  So no, I don't think so.
[06:30:04.569 --> 06:30:11.173]  I really hope that they're able to stick to policy, but I think we're going to be talking a lot more about private parts.
[06:30:11.393 --> 06:30:15.515]  So we both agree Russia, from a non-partisan perspective, should be brought up.
[06:30:15.775 --> 06:30:16.256]  How about this?
[06:30:17.176 --> 06:30:20.219]  Both candidates have differing ideas of tax reform.
[06:30:21.160 --> 06:30:22.041]  Let's hear your thoughts.
[06:30:22.362 --> 06:30:22.722]  Boom.
[06:30:23.102 --> 06:30:23.763]  Go to Hillary.
[06:30:24.083 --> 06:30:24.404]  Boom.
[06:30:24.504 --> 06:30:25.124]  Go to Trump.
[06:30:25.605 --> 06:30:28.348]  I'd like a fair debate on tax reform.
[06:30:28.588 --> 06:30:29.349]  You think we'll get that?
[06:30:30.090 --> 06:30:30.170]  No.
[06:30:30.657 --> 06:30:32.498]  We also want to hear about the economy.
[06:30:33.059 --> 06:30:35.801]  We've got Russia, we've got tax reform, borders.
[06:30:36.181 --> 06:30:38.603]  We know that Hillary Clinton wants open borders.
[06:30:38.643 --> 06:30:40.264]  She's pro-open borders.
[06:30:40.344 --> 06:30:42.746]  Donald Trump, he wants strong borders.
[06:30:42.806 --> 06:30:44.287]  He wants to build a wall even.
[06:30:44.647 --> 06:30:45.548]  Okay, there you go.
[06:30:45.608 --> 06:30:47.990]  Hillary, tell me, why do you like open borders?
[06:30:48.410 --> 06:30:49.611]  Okay, we got your response.
[06:30:49.691 --> 06:30:51.312]  Trump, tell me why you like strong borders.
[06:30:51.412 --> 06:30:53.434]  Boom, so we got Russia, tax reform, borders.
[06:30:53.674 --> 06:30:58.077]  My guess is we'll hear more about groping women than we will about any of these things before we even get started.
[06:30:58.097 --> 06:31:02.578]  Well, and here's what I would just like to point out, and I'm sorry for anyone out there that's gonna be like, ugh.
[06:31:02.978 --> 06:31:09.540]  Okay, so the left acts like they're shocked, just shocked by what Trump said ten years ago.
[06:31:10.160 --> 06:31:16.502]  Meanwhile, today, or maybe it was yesterday, I don't know, Madonna comes out and says she is gonna give oral sex
[06:31:17.102 --> 06:31:19.764]  To anyone that votes for Hillary Clinton.
[06:31:20.485 --> 06:31:21.305]  That's awesome.
[06:31:21.345 --> 06:31:25.449]  And she's there with Amy Schumer, who also Hillary Clinton is a big fan of her.
[06:31:25.749 --> 06:31:30.373]  So here we have these totally perverted women talking about whatever they're going to do.
[06:31:30.553 --> 06:31:31.453]  And that's totally fine.
[06:31:31.473 --> 06:31:37.018]  That's not degrading to women to put yourself out there like that because Madonna's empowered because she's offering to
[06:31:38.579 --> 06:31:46.303]  Do these things to people, but on the other hand, shocked that Donald Trump would dare say anything, you know, about women.
[06:31:46.423 --> 06:31:48.705]  It's just, ugh, the double standard is insane.
[06:31:49.145 --> 06:32:01.212]  Now before we go to Jack Posobiec, I want to make sure everyone understands we are running a mega special right now on the Brain Force, 25% off at InfoWarsLife.com, plus you get free shipping!
[06:32:01.232 --> 06:32:01.292]  Woo!

[06:32:06.535 --> 06:32:10.797]  It's one of the only things that is helping us run through this epic broadcast on zero sleep.
[06:32:11.338 --> 06:32:11.798]  Thank you.
[06:32:12.138 --> 06:32:14.820]  So this is 25% off at Infowarslife.com.
[06:32:15.220 --> 06:32:21.863]  It's for the week's debate mega special free shipping store wide for a limited time.

[06:32:27.501 --> 06:32:27.841]  Shirt!
[06:32:28.201 --> 06:32:30.282]  Infowars.com, legalize freedom.
[06:32:30.643 --> 06:32:33.744]  Now, now we know we talked about having everyone wear red there.
[06:32:33.764 --> 06:32:38.146]  Now, you should wear this, but no, they're going to make you turn the shirt inside out.
[06:32:38.206 --> 06:32:42.528]  You can't wear this into a polling, like within 100 feet of a polling station.
[06:32:42.608 --> 06:32:43.969]  It depends on the state, but yeah.
[06:32:44.289 --> 06:32:44.890]  Still do it.
[06:32:45.070 --> 06:32:46.491]  You know, ruffle people's feathers.
[06:32:46.551 --> 06:32:47.031]  Whatever.
[06:32:47.171 --> 06:32:47.992]  But wear red.
[06:32:48.532 --> 06:32:50.034]  So you can get Brain Force right now.
[06:32:50.054 --> 06:32:51.014]  25% off.
[06:32:51.214 --> 06:32:52.836]  Free shipping is store-wide.
[06:32:52.876 --> 06:32:54.837]  Of course you're helping to support this operation.
[06:32:54.857 --> 06:32:56.238]  This is why we are all here.
[06:32:56.278 --> 06:32:57.739]  This is why we're the tip of the spear.
[06:32:57.780 --> 06:33:05.505]  This is why we're getting name-dropped by Hillary Clinton in her speeches that she wants to take us down because Alex Jones pours every bit of money
[06:33:06.266 --> 06:33:11.591]  Back into this operation because he wants to take down these globalists.
[06:33:11.651 --> 06:33:12.752]  He stands for freedom.
[06:33:12.832 --> 06:33:14.074]  He stands against tyranny.
[06:33:14.474 --> 06:33:18.098]  And you all stand with us when you help support this operation.
[06:33:19.907 --> 06:33:26.389]  And now I am hearing that we actually do have a little preview of the Nigel Farage interview.
[06:33:26.409 --> 06:33:32.151]  I want to get to that because, man, he is a hero in my book and I met him and he was supremely kind.
[06:33:32.612 --> 06:33:34.312]  Guys, do we have that ready?
[06:33:34.732 --> 06:33:35.433]  I'm very excited.
[06:33:35.653 --> 06:33:36.173]  Let's roll it.
[06:33:41.291 --> 06:33:42.633]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Farage.
[06:33:43.293 --> 06:33:44.535]  Americans have seen a lot of clips.
[06:33:44.555 --> 06:33:46.197]  We know what an effective speaker you are.
[06:33:46.237 --> 06:33:52.405]  We know what a fearless speaker you are, going right to the seat of power and taking them on, speaking truth to them.
[06:33:52.705 --> 06:33:56.750]  I want to ask you what Donald Trump needs to do in this final debate tonight.
[06:33:56.770 --> 06:33:59.373]  You see, I think that in the first debate,
[06:34:00.296 --> 06:34:01.196]  She had the better of him.
[06:34:02.477 --> 06:34:03.857]  And that's down to experience.
[06:34:04.697 --> 06:34:07.618]  He was stepping up to a level that he'd never been at before.
[06:34:07.638 --> 06:34:08.338]  I've been there myself.
[06:34:09.259 --> 06:34:26.224]  I've done these big debates and I know that when you're somewhat virginal, going into these things, whether we can call Trump virginal perhaps as a matter of conjecture, but when you're going into these things, and you've never done them before, they're tough, but I felt at the end of the second debate, he completely dominated.
[06:34:26.924 --> 06:34:31.808]  He didn't just dominate her, he dominated the people doing the debates with the moderators.
[06:34:31.848 --> 06:34:34.510]  He said he was in a three against one situation.
[06:34:34.570 --> 06:34:35.471]  He called him out on it.
[06:34:35.531 --> 06:34:35.911]  And he did.
[06:34:36.292 --> 06:34:37.453]  And he was right to do so.
[06:34:37.693 --> 06:34:42.357]  So I think psychologically, he comes to Las Vegas with the upper hand.
[06:34:43.037 --> 06:34:45.960]  She's going to be very nervous going into this tonight.
[06:34:46.600 --> 06:34:47.801]  She's going to play very safe.
[06:34:49.362 --> 06:34:53.966]  And I think he will go in and look for the knockout blow.
[06:34:54.647 --> 06:34:56.048]  Let's talk to the voters for a second.
[06:34:56.448 --> 06:35:04.051]  But when I look at what you did in England, it reminds me of William Wilberforce, the guy who ended slavery virtually single-handedly.
[06:35:04.071 --> 06:35:09.132]  It's what you did when you went to the European Union and you said, we're going to get Britain out of the European Union.
[06:35:09.873 --> 06:35:16.875]  William Wilberforce, for his entire life, took on the moneyed interests, the multinational corporations that were involved in free trade.
[06:35:17.515 --> 06:35:18.776]  Free trade of slaves.
[06:35:19.416 --> 06:35:21.157]  And so he stopped that slavery.
[06:35:21.197 --> 06:35:22.578]  It took him an entire lifetime to do it.
[06:35:22.598 --> 06:35:26.280]  The final vote to outlaw slavery occurred shortly after he died.
[06:35:26.340 --> 06:35:28.282]  So this is a long-term movement.
[06:35:28.842 --> 06:35:31.584]  We can go straight to the seat of power.
[06:35:31.624 --> 06:35:32.804]  William Wilberforce has shown that.
[06:35:33.144 --> 06:35:35.886]  You showed that to us in Britain with Brexit.
[06:35:35.946 --> 06:35:38.828]  We can take them on directly and we can win.
[06:35:38.888 --> 06:35:39.728]  It's a long-term game.
[06:35:39.748 --> 06:35:40.809]  They've been in it for a long term.
[06:35:41.470 --> 06:35:42.570]  This is a movement.
[06:35:42.690 --> 06:35:45.352]  This is what we see being started here in America behind Trump.
[06:35:45.772 --> 06:35:48.194]  And it's a movement that you started with Brexit as well.
[06:35:48.774 --> 06:35:52.597]  Yes, and don't think that this is just America and Britain.
[06:35:53.058 --> 06:36:09.730]  This is actually happening across a lot of Europe as well, and very important that we remember that we've got people in France and Germany and Hungary and Italy and everywhere you go now, people are saying, you know, the global elite have led us very badly, the rich have got richer, the poor have got poorer, this simply isn't working.
[06:36:09.770 --> 06:36:13.593]  And the one thing I would say is, you know, whatever happens,
[06:36:14.565 --> 06:36:19.527]  Here, on November the 8th, American politics is never going to be the same again.
[06:36:19.547 --> 06:36:20.808]  That's right.
[06:36:20.888 --> 06:36:22.468]  It simply can't be, because you're right.
[06:36:23.289 --> 06:36:27.370]  Actually, I mean, Trump's not a Republican candidate, he's an Independent.
[06:36:27.630 --> 06:36:27.751]  Yeah.
[06:36:27.951 --> 06:36:29.051]  He's taken over the party!
[06:36:29.231 --> 06:36:30.332]  He's run the establishment!
[06:36:30.352 --> 06:36:31.532]  You're the one who's running it!
[06:36:31.592 --> 06:36:33.553]  You know, and everyone's run away from him.
[06:36:34.233 --> 06:36:35.574]  He's effectively an Independent.
[06:36:35.754 --> 06:36:38.555]  Now, if he wins, he wins, and America changes course.
[06:36:39.335 --> 06:36:42.797]  But if he doesn't win, if the establishment win this time,
[06:36:44.079 --> 06:36:46.763]  That is not the end of this story.
[06:36:47.023 --> 06:36:52.411]  Because all those people that will be motivated to stand up and do something, they're not going to go away.
[06:36:52.431 --> 06:36:53.913]  They're not going to disappear.
[06:36:54.654 --> 06:36:57.878]  So, yeah, I think ultimately, you know, we've toppled
[06:36:58.607 --> 06:37:00.188]  The establishment in the United Kingdom.
[06:37:00.208 --> 06:37:05.572]  It took us a very, very long time and a whole number of full starts, but we've done it.
[06:37:05.692 --> 06:37:08.254]  And I think that is going to happen in the USA.
[06:37:08.674 --> 06:37:11.216]  It's just a question of whether it's this year or whether you have to wait a bit.
[06:37:11.677 --> 06:37:27.008]  I think we need to sort of start getting the ghosts of Thatcher and Reagan going on the small man and small woman who want to take risk, set up their own little businesses, and who ultimately create real wealth.
[06:37:27.708 --> 06:37:29.849]  Within the economy and create real jobs.
[06:37:29.909 --> 06:37:32.590]  And that is the opportunity that we now have.
[06:37:33.270 --> 06:37:34.411]  We voted for Brexit.
[06:37:34.711 --> 06:37:35.231]  Yeah, sure.
[06:37:35.491 --> 06:37:37.232]  It's going to take us two or three years to sort it all out.
[06:37:37.592 --> 06:37:45.655]  But we've now got a chance to move back towards a genuine capitalist system where people have got a chance of succeeding.
[06:37:45.835 --> 06:37:49.237]  And that, I think, didn't you guys used to call this the American dream?
[06:37:49.597 --> 06:37:49.957]  That's right.
[06:37:50.197 --> 06:37:51.878]  And we used to call it a Declaration of Independence.
[06:37:51.918 --> 06:37:58.462]  We said we're going to take back our freedom, our property, and our self-governance from a small globalist cabal.
[06:37:58.982 --> 06:38:09.067]  I would just finish by saying that whatever happens tonight in this big showdown in Vegas, there's a couple of weeks of full campaigning left.
[06:38:09.807 --> 06:38:17.431]  And what the Trump campaign need to do is to try and get a national conversation going on the very things you and I have just talked about for the last three minutes.
[06:38:17.551 --> 06:38:17.911]  Absolutely.
[06:38:17.951 --> 06:38:18.592]  Thank you so much.
[06:38:18.652 --> 06:38:18.952]  Thank you.
[06:38:58.277 --> 06:39:08.524]  Alright, that was David Knight interviewing Nigel Farage and I know that David was super pumped during that entire interview because he thinks Farage is going to be a hero going down in the history books.
[06:39:09.065 --> 06:39:16.910]  So, we're going to have that interview in its entirety coming up later on in the show when Alex Jones is joining us for the pre-show, the pre-debate.
[06:39:16.970 --> 06:39:17.831]  I believe he'll be here 7 to 8.
[06:39:19.392 --> 06:39:21.954]  So you'll be seeing the rest of that Nigel Farage interview.
[06:39:21.974 --> 06:39:23.075]  I'm super excited about it.
[06:39:23.455 --> 06:39:29.380]  David Knight is going to be joining me at about 6.30, but right now we are going to be joined by our guest Jack Pasovic.
[06:39:30.081 --> 06:39:33.103]  He is the Special Projects Director of Citizens for Trump.
[06:39:34.024 --> 06:39:36.967]  You're also a recovering political operative and a veteran.
[06:39:36.987 --> 06:39:38.348]  Yes.
[06:39:38.768 --> 06:39:40.109]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[06:39:40.149 --> 06:39:40.570]  How are you?
[06:39:41.240 --> 06:39:41.881]  I'm great, Leigh-Anne.
[06:39:41.921 --> 06:39:42.722]  How are you doing tonight?
[06:39:42.762 --> 06:39:43.544]  Are you ready for this?
[06:39:44.145 --> 06:39:44.946]  So ready!
[06:39:45.086 --> 06:39:47.330]  We have no idea what to expect.
[06:39:49.433 --> 06:39:51.657]  Citizens for Trump has received some reports.
[06:39:51.677 --> 06:39:53.700]  We're not certain of their veracity.
[06:39:54.039 --> 06:40:01.203]  But Hillary Clinton's agents may have secretly been trying to purchase brain force so that she can take it prior to the debate.
[06:40:01.564 --> 06:40:04.586]  And that's the only way that she'll be able to make it through the full 90 minutes.
[06:40:04.646 --> 06:40:05.586]  It's the only way.
[06:40:05.626 --> 06:40:09.428]  It's the only way that I'm making it through this epic debate coverage.
[06:40:10.029 --> 06:40:11.830]  We should... I don't want to send her any, though.
[06:40:11.850 --> 06:40:13.511]  You know, we sent her some lung cleanse.
[06:40:14.031 --> 06:40:18.774]  She probably started using it because apparently she hasn't had a major coughing attack in a while.
[06:40:18.874 --> 06:40:19.735]  So, you know what?
[06:40:19.795 --> 06:40:21.136]  I don't want to give her an edge.
[06:40:21.676 --> 06:40:22.657]  I don't want to give her an edge.
[06:40:23.197 --> 06:40:24.058]  So what's going on?
[06:40:24.098 --> 06:40:29.141]  Now I know you sent me a few things that you thought would be very interesting to the audience.
[06:40:29.762 --> 06:40:36.627]  Let's go ahead and start with what you're saying some cyber security experts are talking about with this major WikiLeaks stuff.
[06:40:37.507 --> 06:40:41.190]  So I work out of the Beltway in Washington, D.C.
[06:40:42.521 --> 06:40:52.288]  And a lot of the people that I worked with when I was on active duty and a lot of the people that I'm still friends with and still communicate with are these cyber guys who worked in the special forces and intelligence communities.
[06:40:52.668 --> 06:40:53.389]  The soft guys.
[06:40:53.849 --> 06:41:01.675]  And they look at cyber security going after ISIS, going after Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra Front, AQAP, you name it, Al-Shabaab.
[06:41:01.955 --> 06:41:03.456]  So they work in the private sector now.
[06:41:03.856 --> 06:41:07.439]  Well, I've asked these guys, said, hey, take a look at some of these WikiLeaks, right?
[06:41:07.959 --> 06:41:09.080]  And maybe can you tell me
[06:41:09.798 --> 06:41:12.640]  Yes or no, yay or nay, does this come from Russia?
[06:41:12.760 --> 06:41:13.981]  Does this come from hackers?
[06:41:14.061 --> 06:41:14.601]  What is this?
[06:41:15.682 --> 06:41:20.825]  Every single one of them I've asked, I've asked three different companies at this point, and they've all gotten back to me and said, hacking?
[06:41:21.285 --> 06:41:26.689]  No, Jack, when you get hacking, see that's the difference between data at rest versus data in transit.
[06:41:27.404 --> 06:41:28.865]  Hacking gets data in transit.
[06:41:28.905 --> 06:41:34.170]  That means you're not going to see full emails, you're not going to see email chains, you're not going to see the quantity that we're seeing.
[06:41:34.210 --> 06:41:34.770]  They're saying no.
[06:41:35.231 --> 06:41:45.519]  The only way that they'd be able to uncover the thousands of WikiLeaks emails that we've seen from John Podesta, and we'll soon most likely be seeing from Hillary Clinton soon, is Insider.
[06:41:45.840 --> 06:41:52.886]  That it was an insider that leaked these out, that copied these somehow from their private server, and gave the USB to WikiLeaks.
[06:41:52.986 --> 06:41:55.628]  Very similar to Bradley Chelsea Manning,
[06:41:56.212 --> 06:41:56.632]  I don't think so.
[06:42:16.038 --> 06:42:21.000]  Right, and that's what a lot of people were saying as well with the DNC leaks, saying that it must have been an insider.
[06:42:21.040 --> 06:42:30.123]  Of course, we've seen some really curious people being offed afterward, and the media was incredibly silent about all of that, so... Name is Seth Rich.
[06:42:30.323 --> 06:42:30.823]  Say his name.
[06:42:33.339 --> 06:42:41.105]  Well, so how dangerous do you think that is for them to be talking about the fact that it's Russia and ramping up?
[06:42:41.185 --> 06:42:44.327]  Do you think that they really, truly are wanting to take us to war with Russia?
[06:42:44.467 --> 06:42:49.391]  Or is this all just a plot to get everyone frightened so that they elect Hillary Clinton?
[06:42:50.331 --> 06:42:51.912]  I think that they're playing with fire.
[06:42:51.932 --> 06:42:53.333]  They're like children playing with fire.
[06:42:53.353 --> 06:42:59.498]  I think they're miscalculating and thinking that, well, Russia's busy in Syria right now.
[06:43:00.234 --> 06:43:01.355]  They're eyes off the ball.
[06:43:01.415 --> 06:43:07.180]  We'll just turn Russia into an enemy and into a scapegoat, as has been done many times in the past in U.S.
[06:43:07.220 --> 06:43:08.221]  presidential elections.
[06:43:08.682 --> 06:43:12.265]  However, Vladimir Putin was not the president at those times in the past.
[06:43:12.705 --> 06:43:15.247]  So this is a very different situation we're in.
[06:43:15.307 --> 06:43:17.850]  The entire world is in a very different situation right now.
[06:43:18.210 --> 06:43:25.156]  And it really doesn't make any sense to be taking a country that is actually the leading country in nuclear weapons.
[06:43:25.196 --> 06:43:26.017]  They have more than we do.
[06:43:26.577 --> 06:43:26.877]  I think?
[06:43:45.017 --> 06:43:47.099]  The world's leading nuclear power into war.
[06:43:47.139 --> 06:43:53.566]  Joe Biden, he goes on TV yesterday and he says, well, we're going to launch a covert cyber strike on them.
[06:43:53.606 --> 06:43:56.269]  I'm like, Joe, I hope they don't find out about it.
[06:43:56.289 --> 06:43:58.652]  I think you're using that word wrong, man.
[06:43:58.672 --> 06:43:59.813]  You're on national TV.
[06:44:00.093 --> 06:44:01.475]  Situation room's over there, Joe.
[06:44:02.947 --> 06:44:03.607]  Yeah, that's so funny.
[06:44:03.888 --> 06:44:06.129]  So, do you think the American people will find out about it?
[06:44:06.469 --> 06:44:07.210]  I hope not.
[06:44:07.910 --> 06:44:09.211]  I think... I certainly hope not.
[06:44:09.311 --> 06:44:12.914]  It's just between you, me, and I guess the five people that still watch CNN.
[06:44:13.174 --> 06:44:13.414]  Right.
[06:44:13.574 --> 06:44:15.035]  The Clinton News Network.
[06:44:15.516 --> 06:44:19.238]  So, talk to me a little bit about the Danny Williams being there.
[06:44:19.379 --> 06:44:27.784]  Now, we knew that he probably was going to be a guest here at the last presidential debate, but he's actually launching a lawsuit against the Clintons.
[06:44:28.505 --> 06:44:31.427]  So, we heard some rumblings about this earlier in the week.
[06:44:32.097 --> 06:44:38.441]  And there is a national legal organization that has decided to take up the case of Danny Williams.
[06:44:38.922 --> 06:44:40.603]  And this is not a political organization.
[06:44:40.663 --> 06:44:45.886]  They're actually an organization that stands for civil rights and actually focus on the African American community.
[06:44:46.406 --> 06:44:50.449]  And so they're taking up the case of Danny Williams and they are going.
[06:44:54.198 --> 06:44:54.998]  Oh, all right.
[06:44:55.318 --> 06:44:56.339]  Looks like we lost Jack.
[06:44:56.379 --> 06:44:58.619]  We will be right back with him there.
[06:44:59.000 --> 06:45:01.681]  Again, he's Special Projects Director of Citizens for Trump.
[06:45:02.281 --> 06:45:06.802]  We're talking about some of the cybersecurity experts, what they have to say about WikiLeaks.
[06:45:07.002 --> 06:45:09.003]  No way are these hackers.
[06:45:09.023 --> 06:45:10.163]  This is an inside job.
[06:45:10.764 --> 06:45:12.944]  He was just getting into the Danny Williams lawsuit.
[06:45:13.705 --> 06:45:14.885]  Jack, do we have you back?
[06:45:15.565 --> 06:45:16.585]  Back it up just a little bit.
[06:45:16.605 --> 06:45:17.706]  We lost your feed there.
[06:45:18.652 --> 06:45:18.952]  I am back.
[06:45:18.972 --> 06:45:20.233]  They're trying to cut me off right now.
[06:45:21.693 --> 06:45:23.554]  As soon as I talk about Danny Williams, they cut me off.
[06:45:23.714 --> 06:45:23.954]  Wow.
[06:45:24.574 --> 06:45:25.394]  Now, this is incredible.
[06:45:25.434 --> 06:45:30.156]  This is what we see across the board when people are speaking about certain topics.
[06:45:30.296 --> 06:45:31.417]  Their feed goes out.
[06:45:32.197 --> 06:45:33.697]  I mean, this is phenomenal.
[06:45:34.458 --> 06:45:46.962]  So Danny Williams, the son, the long lost son, I like saying long lost son of Bill Clinton, who was banished essentially by Hillary Clinton, will be, I believe, presenting a challenge tonight.
[06:45:47.518 --> 06:45:54.699]  In just really 15 minutes time he's going to begin and challenging Bill Clinton to finally take a DNA test.
[06:45:54.799 --> 06:45:57.740]  No DNA test, no real test was ever done in the past.
[06:45:58.080 --> 06:46:00.400]  You know what they claim a DNA test was done?
[06:46:00.800 --> 06:46:03.461]  They took the star report that was done, you remember the blue dress?
[06:46:03.681 --> 06:46:03.881]  Right.
[06:46:03.901 --> 06:46:10.582]  They took the star report summary of the blue dress and then compared that with Danny Williams' DNA and said that was a DNA test.
[06:46:10.822 --> 06:46:11.022]  Right.
[06:46:11.042 --> 06:46:13.323]  That's not a DNA test, that wouldn't hold up in any court.
[06:46:13.663 --> 06:46:14.443]  Right, and that's the-
[06:46:15.791 --> 06:46:26.336]  I'm sorry, but I was going to say, that's the thing that's so interesting is that any other time something would come from Star or Globe, the mainstream media would say, oh, that's just, you know, National Enquirer type stuff, whatever.
[06:46:26.396 --> 06:46:29.738]  But this, they took it, they ran with it, open and close, shut case.
[06:46:29.818 --> 06:46:31.459]  They didn't ever want to talk about it again.
[06:46:31.539 --> 06:46:32.519]  It's been debunked.
[06:46:33.480 --> 06:46:34.660]  Because they're playing sides.
[06:46:34.680 --> 06:46:36.901]  So Danny's saying, take the test.
[06:46:37.321 --> 06:46:38.502]  I'm willing to take the test.
[06:46:38.562 --> 06:46:42.784]  And I've been told he has already provided a blood sample that is on file.
[06:46:43.726 --> 06:46:52.690]  And if Bill Clinton refuses to take the paternity test, then in two days time, they will be dropping the lawsuit in New York Federal Court.
[06:46:53.390 --> 06:47:00.133]  And we also know that Donald Trump has a Benghazi mother is going to be there from what I hear as well.
[06:47:00.233 --> 06:47:02.214]  So a lot of surprises there to kind of ruffle.
[06:47:02.494 --> 06:47:04.295]  And Malik Obama as well.
[06:47:04.675 --> 06:47:05.416]  That's right.
[06:47:05.656 --> 06:47:06.656]  Yes, I was.
[06:47:07.036 --> 06:47:10.178]  Now, a lot of people are saying, well, why would they bring Malik Obama?
[06:47:10.238 --> 06:47:12.259]  How is that going to upset Hillary Clinton?
[06:47:13.442 --> 06:47:23.274]  I think that Malik Obama comes with a very different perspective from all of this, because Malik Obama isn't looking at this from, you know, he's one side or another side.
[06:47:23.294 --> 06:47:25.476]  He's Barack Obama's older brother.
[06:47:25.977 --> 06:47:33.626]  And when he gave an interview earlier to WeSearcher earlier this year, he said very definitively, he said, I love my little brother, but I'm very disappointed.
[06:47:34.096 --> 06:47:43.699]  And I think that Hillary Clinton is one of the people that he started listening to when he became president that he shouldn't have listened to because she led him astray and she led him down the wrong path.
[06:47:44.460 --> 06:47:53.443]  And for her to be running as president now, this person who essentially ruined my brother's presidency in his eyes, is completely the wrong person that should be leading the country.
[06:47:54.184 --> 06:47:54.424]  Wow.
[06:47:54.584 --> 06:47:57.767]  Yeah, I mean, because we all know that the president is just a puppet.
[06:47:57.847 --> 06:48:05.812]  However, I do feel like Hillary Clinton has a lot of experience and cannot wait to get her hands on the levers of power.
[06:48:06.613 --> 06:48:08.614]  Now, I know, Owen, you had a question for Jack.
[06:48:09.975 --> 06:48:12.497]  Yeah, Jack, good to be speaking with you again, buddy.
[06:48:12.597 --> 06:48:14.278]  I'm curious... What's up, Owen?
[06:48:14.298 --> 06:48:17.361]  You know, we're talking a lot about voter fraud and these rigged elections.
[06:48:17.441 --> 06:48:19.262]  Obviously, Trump has brought this to the forefront.
[06:48:19.803 --> 06:48:30.251]  I'm curious if Citizens for Trump is aware of the connection now between George Soros and the electronic voting machines in 16 states, and if you guys have any planned response for this.
[06:48:31.492 --> 06:48:35.935]  Honestly, Owen, that's something that we've been tracking on our own for several months now.
[06:48:36.551 --> 06:48:36.731]  I don't
[06:48:52.873 --> 06:49:01.055]  Our planned solution to this is that we're working in concert with both lawyers and I mentioned those cybersecurity experts at the beginning of the interview.
[06:49:01.716 --> 06:49:03.116]  They're working in concert.
[06:49:03.136 --> 06:49:05.857]  A lot of them are volunteering their time in swing states.
[06:49:06.277 --> 06:49:10.178]  We've targeted districts that we believe to have more, shall we say nefarious
[06:49:10.800 --> 06:49:11.161]  I don't
[06:49:25.859 --> 06:49:34.227]  Any tampering that's been done on these machines, they've already filed to be able to check the machines both before the election for tampering and after the election for tampering.
[06:49:34.267 --> 06:49:40.453]  So they'll be able to see these microchips, these memory cards, if there's any tampering that's been done on an electronic level.
[06:49:40.813 --> 06:49:46.018]  If it has been done, the cyber guys turn the evidence directly over to the lawyers and they file a lawsuit.
[06:49:46.243 --> 06:49:48.346]  Wow, incredible government accountability.
[06:49:49.627 --> 06:49:51.649]  What is happening here?
[06:49:51.729 --> 06:49:55.194]  It's kind of funny the government doesn't do that on its own.
[06:49:55.254 --> 06:49:55.774]  Exactly.
[06:49:56.135 --> 06:49:59.839]  Well that's what the media used to be for and then the government bought and paid for all the media.
[06:50:00.119 --> 06:50:01.401]  But you know one of the things that
[06:50:01.661 --> 06:50:08.024]  We're thinking about doing, Jack, to help avoid this election being stolen, is wearing red on November 8th.
[06:50:08.064 --> 06:50:08.844]  Now, I don't understand.
[06:50:08.864 --> 06:50:12.466]  Some people are saying, oh, well, I already voted, or oh, you know, I can't vote.
[06:50:12.486 --> 06:50:14.927]  And they say, oh, no, just wear red on November 8th.
[06:50:14.987 --> 06:50:16.868]  I'm not saying you have to go to the poll and wear red.
[06:50:16.888 --> 06:50:23.090]  I'm just saying, by wearing red on November 8th, we can show that we dominate in the numbers, dominate in the optics of it.
[06:50:23.570 --> 06:50:26.292]  Is this something that you think citizens for Trump would get behind?
[06:50:26.332 --> 06:50:29.433]  What are your thoughts on Trump voters wearing red on Election Day?
[06:50:30.134 --> 06:50:33.556]  Trump voters, Citizens Trump has absolutely been behind this from the start.
[06:50:34.196 --> 06:50:37.318]  We heard about it right after you guys announced it and I think it's excellent.
[06:50:38.139 --> 06:50:48.905]  One thing that we've noticed and we've seen throughout this election is no matter how much the media tells us that Hillary is winning, internal polls and any actual evidence, metrics, all tell you that's not true.
[06:50:49.261 --> 06:50:58.229]  There are more Trump signs, there are more Trump votes in the primary, there's huge GOP turnout, there's the record number of GOP votes in the primary.
[06:50:58.529 --> 06:51:06.717]  And so when people actually see the fact that there's, and we get it, you know, there's a legal aspect to this, a technological aspect to it, and a public opinion aspect to it.
[06:51:06.997 --> 06:51:12.542]  When people see the massive red Trump landslide at the polls, no one will call into question
[06:51:13.075 --> 06:51:19.903]  And if there's any allegations that Hillary wins by 20 points or something, everyone is going to know it's false.
[06:51:19.963 --> 06:51:24.948]  And everyone is going to know that what Mr. Trump has been saying is absolutely true, that this system is rigged.
[06:51:24.968 --> 06:51:26.430]  The election is rigged.
[06:51:26.741 --> 06:51:41.696]  Right, and also people really need to pay attention when they are placing their vote and checking it and hit enter, because a lot of people have already reported seeing their votes changing, and if you don't look before you hit enter, it's changed, which I think is insane.
[06:51:41.997 --> 06:51:46.882]  We hear about that every single election cycle, even with local votes here.
[06:51:48.303 --> 06:51:50.064]  I don't know why it happens, but it happens.
[06:51:50.104 --> 06:51:53.807]  So you have to make sure that you check before you hit enter on that.
[06:51:55.288 --> 06:51:56.549]  They do all sorts of stuff like this.
[06:51:56.569 --> 06:51:57.710]  They'll change around the ballot.
[06:51:57.750 --> 06:51:58.831]  They'll put 10 people.
[06:51:58.851 --> 06:52:02.173]  They'll put the buttons over on the side and the names in the middle.
[06:52:02.213 --> 06:52:07.377]  They'll do all sorts of stuff to obfuscate this and not let the voters simply vote for the candidate of their choosing.
[06:52:08.132 --> 06:52:12.894]  And that's one of the things I know a lot of people say, your vote doesn't matter, your vote doesn't count.
[06:52:12.954 --> 06:52:15.836]  And yeah, in some ways, of course, the system can be rigged.
[06:52:15.856 --> 06:52:32.904]  But if that was entirely true, it was entirely true that your vote didn't count, why such a concerted effort for the vote rigging, for the violent protesters, for the machines not working properly, all the dead voters and people allowing illegal aliens to vote and things like that.
[06:52:32.964 --> 06:52:35.525]  If your vote didn't matter, they wouldn't even worry about it.
[06:52:36.345 --> 06:52:38.106]  They cannot cover up a landslide.
[06:52:38.386 --> 06:52:44.290]  If there's a landslide, and they try to cover it up and say that Hillary won, then people will all know.
[06:52:44.490 --> 06:52:47.171]  People will know that that result is false, and they will throw it out.
[06:52:47.591 --> 06:52:58.978]  From a legal perspective, that means we will be calling for recounts directly in four or five of the major swing states, and we will make the 2000 in Florida look like a walk in the park compared to the legal
[06:53:01.285 --> 06:53:05.366]  Well, I gotta be honest, Jack, I think that's their plan.
[06:53:05.647 --> 06:53:06.827]  I think that that's their plan.
[06:53:06.847 --> 06:53:14.049]  They already know the landslide's here, and they're already planning on doing anything and everything to try to steal this from Trump.
[06:53:14.429 --> 06:53:25.051]  And then on the backburners, they've got their plan B, which is to blame Russia for hacking the election in case they can't rig the systems to get the Hillary Clinton result that they want.
[06:53:25.471 --> 06:53:27.872]  It's truly some unbelievable times we're living in, Jack.
[06:53:27.892 --> 06:53:32.075]  But they can't say the Russians hacked the election to get Hillary in.
[06:53:33.335 --> 06:53:38.999]  Isn't it crazy that when Barack Obama, he's been so triggered this week that he gave a press conference about it.
[06:53:39.059 --> 06:53:40.920]  He says, no, Trump is wrong.
[06:53:40.980 --> 06:53:42.301]  The election isn't rigged.
[06:53:42.844 --> 06:53:44.846]  But the election is rigged by the Russians.
[06:53:45.166 --> 06:53:50.330]  So leave this side of my mouth, but not this side.
[06:53:50.550 --> 06:53:52.732]  DHS is freaking out over hackings.
[06:53:52.772 --> 06:53:54.193]  They're going to be watching the polls.
[06:53:54.233 --> 06:53:55.994]  The UN is going to be watching the polls.
[06:53:56.315 --> 06:54:03.841]  I've got like five stories right here of people on election boards in Indiana, in Texas, elections export.
[06:54:03.881 --> 06:54:07.664]  We have four million ineligible and dead voters.
[06:54:08.004 --> 06:54:11.187]  Don't try to tell me that rigged elections aren't going on!
[06:54:11.227 --> 06:54:12.088]  We caught them!
[06:54:12.408 --> 06:54:15.350]  What does that even mean?
[06:54:15.470 --> 06:54:17.612]  What does a rigged election even mean?
[06:54:17.752 --> 06:54:18.633]  I've never heard of that!
[06:54:18.653 --> 06:54:21.135]  Alright Jack, just one last question from you.
[06:54:21.516 --> 06:54:24.158]  What do you hope to see, what do you expect from tonight's debate?
[06:54:25.259 --> 06:54:27.901]  From tonight's debate, I think that we're going to see Donald Trump
[06:54:29.998 --> 06:54:30.478]  I think it's
[06:54:54.201 --> 06:54:59.649]  A better life for yourself and for your kids, then I'm the guy for that because I'm going to bring America back to the American people.
[06:54:59.969 --> 06:55:06.679]  If you want more corporatism or cronyism or globalism, then you can go with Hillary Clinton because that's all that she is.
[06:55:06.859 --> 06:55:07.741]  She is their puppet.
[06:55:08.160 --> 06:55:11.321]  Absolutely, and that's why we're calling this Freedom vs. Tyranny.
[06:55:11.701 --> 06:55:16.742]  It absolutely is, and everybody, I'm so glad just so many people rallying around right now.
[06:55:16.782 --> 06:55:19.563]  We see how epic and important these times are that we're living in.
[06:55:19.923 --> 06:55:20.483]  Jack, thanks.
[06:55:20.663 --> 06:55:25.564]  Thank you so much for joining us once again, and hopefully we'll be talking to you really soon before the election.
[06:55:25.584 --> 06:55:27.085]  That's Jack DeSobing.
[06:55:28.045 --> 06:55:30.205]  Citizens for Trump, be sure you follow him on Twitter.
[06:55:30.305 --> 06:55:31.966]  I know you're going to be live tweeting the debate tonight.
[06:55:32.665 --> 06:55:33.425]  You know I'm going to be.
[06:55:33.445 --> 06:55:36.206]  I'm actually going to be at the Trump Winery live tweeting tonight.
[06:55:36.226 --> 06:55:36.907]  So it's going to be nice.
[06:55:36.987 --> 06:55:37.267]  Nice.
[06:55:37.367 --> 06:55:38.247]  Sipping a little wine.
[06:55:38.327 --> 06:55:38.587]  All right.
[06:55:38.627 --> 06:55:38.967]  Well, thanks.
[06:55:38.987 --> 06:55:39.668]  We'll talk to you soon.
[06:55:39.688 --> 06:55:40.868]  Take it easy.
[06:55:41.488 --> 06:55:54.213]  You know, and it's what's amazing, Leigh-Anne, about what he just said, talking about how Trump's biggest job, and I think most people would agree, is getting up there and really hammering home how Hillary Clinton is the establishment candidate.
[06:55:54.253 --> 06:55:56.454]  Most people in America can't stand the establishment.
[06:55:56.474 --> 06:55:59.315]  They're still confused about who or what the establishment is.
[06:55:59.875 --> 06:56:01.056]  But this is like a layup.
[06:56:01.576 --> 06:56:04.018]  This is like a wide receiver wide open downfield.
[06:56:04.078 --> 06:56:07.200]  This is like a hole for a running back 20 feet wide.
[06:56:07.240 --> 06:56:08.701]  This is the easiest thing to do.
[06:56:09.002 --> 06:56:14.806]  It shouldn't be hard to convince the American public that Hillary Clinton is the establishment candidate.
[06:56:15.086 --> 06:56:26.795]  I'm guessing that the roadblock that he's having is the fact that there's been so much levied against him in the media by Obama that they just think so negatively about Trump.
[06:56:27.355 --> 06:56:44.870]  That even though what he says is true, they can't hear it or they won't accept it because they've been so brainwashed into hating Trump or thinking he's some evil guy for whatever, this, that, or the other thing, that even though he's up here making layup after layup after layup, Hillary Clinton's the establishment candidate, duh, like hello.
[06:56:45.490 --> 06:56:48.151]  Still, people, for whatever reason... Just look at the evidence that's before you.
[06:56:48.192 --> 06:56:49.032]  Yeah, like I said, it's a laugh.
[06:56:49.052 --> 06:56:50.032]  So it's the cognitive dissonance.
[06:56:50.073 --> 06:56:51.053]  People don't want to hear it.
[06:56:51.093 --> 06:57:01.659]  Plus, these words, racist, sexist, homophobic, Islamophobic, all of these words have been being weaponized, primed into the minds of young people, old people, whatever.
[06:57:02.059 --> 06:57:05.741]  Being called one of these words is equivalent to being a mass murderer.
[06:57:06.201 --> 06:57:09.783]  It's, you know, it's like worse than death really to be called one of these words.
[06:57:10.243 --> 06:57:19.789]  And so it's so powerful that that's all they have to do is just drip that out that, oh, Trump is this and everyone's going to buy it because they all want to be on the right side of history.
[06:57:19.849 --> 06:57:23.871]  They want to be able to look back and say, wow, we were a part of the revolution.
[06:57:23.931 --> 06:57:25.372]  We were a part of changing the world.
[06:57:25.772 --> 06:57:35.598]  But what they don't realize is that their minds have been programmed to be triggered by certain words so that they can be weaponized and controlled and moved in a certain way, which is why
[06:57:36.178 --> 06:57:42.020]  Everyone out there, you've got to give yourself a pat on the back if you're super frustrated during this thing and you're still awake.
[06:57:42.981 --> 06:57:48.483]  You haven't been programmed, you haven't fallen victim to the PSYOP, so you've really got to commend yourself on that.
[06:57:48.523 --> 06:57:57.407]  No matter what happens on election day, we all have to understand that we're awake, we're alive, we're going to keep fighting, and we're not victims of this massive PSYOP campaign.
[06:57:58.047 --> 06:58:09.154]  Speaking of that, now I want to get Margaret Howland here next, but I want to play one of the videos you kind of put together, a best of snippet of the Project Veritas, the undercover videos there from James O'Keefe.
[06:58:09.614 --> 06:58:11.956]  Just really amazing footage that...
[06:58:13.252 --> 06:58:17.575]  The mainstream media is kind of being forced to talk about this stuff because it's gone so viral.
[06:58:17.655 --> 06:58:20.838]  People out there just saying, whoa, CNN, you better report on this.
[06:58:20.878 --> 06:58:22.119]  This is so much corruption.
[06:58:22.339 --> 06:58:24.240]  How can you say that these tapes have been doctored?
[06:58:24.600 --> 06:58:32.366]  But they're kind of trying to paint James O'Keefe as some sort of a criminal because he was caught with wiretapping or something.
[06:58:32.386 --> 06:58:36.109]  And it's like, no, you're not going to do what Hillary Clinton has done where she says
[06:58:37.344 --> 06:58:39.785]  Don't look at what the contents of the leak are.
[06:58:39.845 --> 06:58:41.265]  Just know that the Russians did it.
[06:58:41.326 --> 06:58:42.566]  So look away, everyone.
[06:58:42.606 --> 06:58:42.946]  Look away.
[06:58:43.006 --> 06:58:48.028]  Don't worry about what's been exposed by these tapes or by these emails.
[06:58:48.548 --> 06:58:51.889]  Just know that it's illegal to look at it because you're a Russian agent.
[06:58:53.570 --> 06:58:53.971]  Otherwise.
[06:58:54.031 --> 06:59:01.980]  Well, the only television show in the news or political realm that I've seen giving this fair coverage is Sean Hannity.
[06:59:02.460 --> 06:59:08.187]  Megyn Kelly mentioned it, but she used the caveat, hidden cam footage, hidden cam foot...
[06:59:08.587 --> 06:59:10.969]  Well, this is more than hidden cam footage, you witch!
[06:59:11.369 --> 06:59:18.594]  Okay, this is investigative reporting that was well-produced, well-thought-out, and then well-documented.
[06:59:18.614 --> 06:59:23.398]  So, to just, uh, hidden cam... No, Megyn Kelly, you know, I'd like to get a hidden cam on you, but you know what?
[06:59:23.418 --> 06:59:24.278]  That's none of my business.
[06:59:24.659 --> 06:59:24.779]  But...
[06:59:26.680 --> 06:59:31.462]  More damning evidence against Hillary Clinton and the Hillary Clinton campaign in spades.
[06:59:31.702 --> 06:59:33.743]  Jake Tapper has a blurb.
[06:59:34.023 --> 06:59:36.304]  He has a blurb about it in his show.
[06:59:36.744 --> 06:59:38.545]  And then James O'Keefe is like, why didn't you cover it?
[06:59:38.565 --> 06:59:41.466]  And he goes, we mentioned your hidden cam footage on our show.
[06:59:41.766 --> 06:59:42.507]  You mentioned it.
[06:59:42.907 --> 06:59:43.627]  You didn't cover it.
[06:59:43.667 --> 06:59:44.888]  This is the biggest news story.
[06:59:45.228 --> 06:59:47.489]  James O'Keefe deserves an award.
[06:59:47.509 --> 06:59:49.830]  Let's go ahead and roll these highlights.
[06:59:49.970 --> 06:59:51.431]  I believe so as well.
[06:59:51.591 --> 06:59:52.951]  Yeah, guys, we have those queued up.
[06:59:53.551 --> 06:59:54.592]  Whatever order you want.
[06:59:56.328 --> 07:00:00.430]  When you're protesting and you do these actions, you will be attacked at Trump rallies.
[07:00:00.470 --> 07:00:01.391]  That's what he does.
[07:00:01.411 --> 07:00:03.132]  People will freak the f*** out.
[07:00:03.552 --> 07:00:04.873]  His security team will freak out.
[07:00:05.213 --> 07:00:07.154]  And his supporters will lose their s***.
[07:00:07.174 --> 07:00:10.075]  We are contracted directly with the DNC and the campaign.
[07:00:10.155 --> 07:00:10.455]  Both.
[07:00:11.896 --> 07:00:13.037]  There's a double blind there.
[07:00:13.157 --> 07:00:13.517]  No.
[07:00:13.817 --> 07:00:17.158]  So they can plausibly deny that they knew anything about it.
[07:00:17.638 --> 07:00:18.279]  There's a script.
[07:00:18.559 --> 07:00:19.419]  Oh, there is a script.
[07:00:19.439 --> 07:00:19.999]  There's a script.
[07:00:20.039 --> 07:00:20.399]  Okay.
[07:00:20.419 --> 07:00:21.940]  There's a script of engagement.
[07:00:22.420 --> 07:00:25.501]  Sometimes the crazies bite, sometimes the crazies don't bite.
[07:00:25.741 --> 07:00:27.982]  They're starting confrontations in the line.
[07:00:28.302 --> 07:00:29.023]  Mm-hmm.
[07:00:29.083 --> 07:00:29.303]  Right?
[07:00:29.343 --> 07:00:31.123]  They're not starting confrontations in the rally.
[07:00:31.163 --> 07:00:32.364]  To volunteers.
[07:00:32.404 --> 07:00:35.545]  Because once they're inside the rally, they're under Secret Service's control.
[07:00:36.125 --> 07:00:39.046]  When they're outside the rally, they're more affected out.
[07:00:39.086 --> 07:00:40.007]  They're harder to get in.
[07:00:40.167 --> 07:00:40.687]  The media
[07:00:41.837 --> 07:00:43.738]  I assume it's always in the rally.
[07:00:43.758 --> 07:00:44.118]  Mm-hmm.
[07:01:02.675 --> 07:01:10.139]  Wherever these events are, which means we have to have a central kind of agitator training.
[07:01:10.560 --> 07:01:12.081]  Nobody's really supposed to know about me.
[07:01:13.702 --> 07:01:17.644]  So the Chicago protest, when they shot all that, that was us.
[07:01:17.824 --> 07:01:22.186]  It was more him than me, but none of this is supposed to come back to us.
[07:01:23.007 --> 07:01:24.668]  Because we want it coming from people.
[07:01:24.688 --> 07:01:27.129]  We don't want it to come from the party.
[07:01:27.149 --> 07:01:28.270]  We pay to do sh**.
[07:01:30.763 --> 07:01:36.249]  Make no mistake, over the last 20 years, I've paid off a few homeless guys to do some crazy stuff.
[07:01:36.349 --> 07:01:42.335]  And I've also taken them for dinner, and I've also made sure they had a hotel, and a shower, and I've put them in a program.
[07:01:42.355 --> 07:01:43.416]  Like, I've done that.
[07:01:44.818 --> 07:01:48.822]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[07:01:48.962 --> 07:01:51.384]  Americanism, not globalism.
[07:01:51.765 --> 07:01:53.747]  Americanism, not globalism.
[07:01:56.118 --> 07:01:56.538]  Incredible.
[07:01:56.778 --> 07:01:59.920]  And that is incredible work coming out of Project Veritas once again.
[07:01:59.980 --> 07:02:01.801]  But there, you know, did you see the guy on camera?
[07:02:01.821 --> 07:02:02.622]  What a great guy!
[07:02:02.682 --> 07:02:14.869]  What a nice guy taking care of the homeless, mentally ill people that they take advantage of to make them go out and they specifically target the mentally unfit and get them to do their dirty work.
[07:02:14.969 --> 07:02:18.693]  And then they give him a, you know, a hot shower and maybe a good meal for the day.
[07:02:18.713 --> 07:02:18.973]  Thanks.
[07:02:19.353 --> 07:02:21.035]  Thanks for doing our dirty work for us.
[07:02:21.115 --> 07:02:23.578]  This is, this is the true left.
[07:02:23.678 --> 07:02:27.061]  This is what they don't want you to know about what they're really doing out there.
[07:02:27.101 --> 07:02:38.332]  They're, you know, they make the case that I think they say Donald Trump said the R word or something many, many years ago, but then here they, this is how they really feel about mentally
[07:02:39.631 --> 07:02:39.751]  It's
[07:03:01.187 --> 07:03:07.969]  Up until last year, all the way throughout this year and all of Trump's rallies, saying there is no way, where are these people coming from?
[07:03:08.110 --> 07:03:12.771]  And then of course, we knew they were being bused in, put all of these reports out there.
[07:03:13.011 --> 07:03:15.412]  People were bashing us, saying how dare you?
[07:03:15.492 --> 07:03:17.153]  This is a conspiracy theory.
[07:03:17.513 --> 07:03:18.653]  There's no proof of it.
[07:03:18.813 --> 07:03:23.335]  And then lo and behold, it's not something that they've been doing just this election cycle.
[07:03:23.655 --> 07:03:28.296]  According to that guy, they've been doing it for 50 years and they're not going to stop any time soon.
[07:03:28.676 --> 07:03:30.136]  Margaret Howell joins me now.
[07:03:30.456 --> 07:03:35.737]  I'd say the one good thing that we've got is that so far two of these operatives have been fired.
[07:03:36.237 --> 07:03:37.918]  We don't know what happened with Aaron Black.
[07:03:38.278 --> 07:03:39.658]  You know, possibly he is as well.
[07:03:39.698 --> 07:03:41.698]  But it's like, sure, great, that's good.
[07:03:42.158 --> 07:03:43.419]  Get rid of the low-hanging fruit.
[07:03:43.519 --> 07:03:46.559]  But they're just doing what their bosses told them to do.
[07:03:47.099 --> 07:03:48.239]  Who's up at the top level?
[07:03:48.399 --> 07:03:48.820]  Exactly.
[07:03:48.840 --> 07:03:51.120]  So Scott Foval, that's his name, he's no longer with us.
[07:03:52.364 --> 07:03:56.666]  But you know his comments, they reminded me of George Soros when he called the Catholics useful idiots.
[07:03:57.026 --> 07:04:00.087]  They go out and find useful idiots to do their dirty work for them.
[07:04:00.247 --> 07:04:02.008]  I mean, talk about shameful.
[07:04:02.048 --> 07:04:07.570]  The man was without remorse saying this about poor disabled people, homeless people.
[07:04:07.590 --> 07:04:13.453]  We're just going to take, you know, people that kind of need a dollar, maybe, and we're going to use them to the best that we can.
[07:04:13.493 --> 07:04:14.953]  It's absolutely despicable.
[07:04:15.254 --> 07:04:18.175]  But the good news is Scott Fovill is no longer with the organization.
[07:04:18.595 --> 07:04:20.136]  They threw us a bone.
[07:04:20.516 --> 07:04:23.858]  They threw us a bone and they say, oh well, we fired him, we let him go.
[07:04:23.939 --> 07:04:26.500]  Just like they threw us a bone with Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[07:04:26.580 --> 07:04:29.362]  Oh no, she's no longer heading up the DNC.
[07:04:29.462 --> 07:04:30.883]  But we're still going to be corrupt.
[07:04:30.923 --> 07:04:32.504]  And now Donna Brazile has come out.
[07:04:32.544 --> 07:04:37.327]  She's just as corrupt, doing dirty work, sending Hillary Clinton the questions before the town hall.
[07:04:37.748 --> 07:04:40.169]  So it's not like they're going to stop doing what they're doing.
[07:04:40.649 --> 07:04:45.993]  But they're going to throw us a bone and make it appear as if the citizens have won.
[07:04:47.774 --> 07:04:48.394]  Listen to you.
[07:04:49.214 --> 07:04:53.415]  Owen just got off the desk, mind you, and he is just chomping at the vet, texting.
[07:04:53.435 --> 07:04:55.196]  I just got a text from Owen.
[07:04:55.316 --> 07:05:02.957]  Trump chants are drowning out CNN pre-debate coverage, you know, and yet Hillary somehow is eking ahead in the polls.
[07:05:03.037 --> 07:05:04.037]  Go figure, you know.
[07:05:04.057 --> 07:05:08.698]  Yeah, the Clinton News Network's like, she's nine points ahead according to our totally rigged polls.
[07:05:08.758 --> 07:05:10.019]  Hey, don't be, that's comforting.
[07:05:10.079 --> 07:05:12.099]  But we do know, here's what we do know about polls.
[07:05:12.179 --> 07:05:15.480]  So in 1980, the Gallup poll, they had Carter at 54, Reagan at 46.
[07:05:16.940 --> 07:05:26.251]  Reagan took 44 states, so let's take a distorted poll and wad it up into more people's minds and make it think they have any authority at all.
[07:05:26.271 --> 07:05:27.212]  The guy's got no chance.
[07:05:27.292 --> 07:05:27.612]  Right.
[07:05:27.772 --> 07:05:29.454]  She's nine points ahead in another poll.
[07:05:29.474 --> 07:05:33.539]  1988, I don't know if you remember this, they had to caucus up 17 points.
[07:05:33.839 --> 07:05:35.141]  We all know how that turned out.
[07:05:35.421 --> 07:05:38.543]  So why do we even have the poll situation?
[07:05:38.583 --> 07:05:39.564]  I don't understand why.
[07:05:39.924 --> 07:05:45.788]  History is showing us that these have no influence at all on the outcomes of elections, but we're still doing them?
[07:05:45.928 --> 07:05:46.128]  Right.
[07:05:46.208 --> 07:05:49.130]  And something that they never do are the live exit polls.
[07:05:49.150 --> 07:05:54.253]  They don't really take the exit polls because they don't want people to know what actually happened.
[07:05:54.353 --> 07:05:56.975]  But the polls are so important beforehand.
[07:05:57.355 --> 07:06:01.416]  To push a certain narrative, but coming out of the line... Exactly.
[07:06:01.456 --> 07:06:02.696]  There's no way to do it.
[07:06:02.736 --> 07:06:03.837]  You can't be accurate.
[07:06:04.197 --> 07:06:05.637]  We're too smart for you all.
[07:06:05.657 --> 07:06:08.938]  We've got these mathematical ways of finding out who's going to win.
[07:06:08.958 --> 07:06:09.658]  Okay.
[07:06:10.038 --> 07:06:10.678]  Yeah.
[07:06:10.878 --> 07:06:11.879]  You know what you could do with that?
[07:06:11.919 --> 07:06:17.520]  You could wad it up and stick it where the sun doesn't shine, because clearly those have a lot of barrier on the outcomes of things.
[07:06:18.080 --> 07:06:21.821]  Well, speaking of the Clinton News Network, this is obviously something that we have
[07:06:23.027 --> 07:06:24.209]  Really, we've known.
[07:06:24.229 --> 07:06:33.763]  I mean, we've been jokingly, lovingly calling it the Clinton News Network for years because that's what it is, but now it's just so unabashedly pro-Clinton and they don't even care.
[07:06:33.783 --> 07:06:35.245]  They don't even try to hide it anymore.
[07:06:35.265 --> 07:06:37.228]  We just had a story where
[07:06:38.209 --> 07:06:48.778]  Someone was on talking about... Representative Collins, this congressman, he actually... So they invite him on to talk about Trump's pre-debate strategy, how he's prepping for the debate.
[07:06:48.798 --> 07:06:51.641]  We know that Trump was in Colorado hammering home.
[07:06:51.661 --> 07:06:54.283]  He's doing these rallies even hours prior to a debate.
[07:06:54.563 --> 07:06:55.224]  He doesn't stop.
[07:06:55.264 --> 07:06:56.665]  Meanwhile, Clinton is resting.
[07:06:56.705 --> 07:06:58.146]  She's probably still in bed.
[07:06:58.587 --> 07:07:03.651]  He brings up WikiLeaks, of course, because that's kind of important, you know, kind of, you know,
[07:07:03.891 --> 07:07:06.713]  The biggest story of the year thus far for Project Veritas.
[07:07:06.954 --> 07:07:07.934]  Without fail.
[07:07:08.074 --> 07:07:11.657]  So without fail, on video, on cue, cuts the signal.
[07:07:11.978 --> 07:07:18.703]  You know, he's gone for several seconds and Cuomo's face was like, oh man, we didn't see that happening.
[07:07:18.763 --> 07:07:19.564]  What just happened?
[07:07:19.584 --> 07:07:20.184]  Oh boy.
[07:07:20.224 --> 07:07:21.185]  Terrible actor.
[07:07:21.506 --> 07:07:22.026]  Terrible.
[07:07:22.126 --> 07:07:22.947]  Rotten tomatoes.
[07:07:23.107 --> 07:07:24.248]  Five rotten tomatoes.
[07:07:24.668 --> 07:07:29.251]  I mean, he's probably the one underneath the table pulling the switch because it happened lightning speed.
[07:07:29.271 --> 07:07:31.052]  He probably does have control over that.
[07:07:31.372 --> 07:07:32.412]  You're absolutely right.
[07:07:32.593 --> 07:07:35.634]  He's right there mid-sentence saying, Hillary Clinton's a liar.
[07:07:35.674 --> 07:07:36.575]  She can't be trusted.
[07:07:36.855 --> 07:07:38.876]  And now the two faces of Hillary are coming out.
[07:07:39.156 --> 07:07:41.458]  The fact that through WikiLeaks, she says one thing and...
[07:07:42.558 --> 07:07:43.099]  Shut down.
[07:07:43.479 --> 07:07:45.581]  And of course, we have it documented.
[07:07:45.601 --> 07:07:48.885]  People have put videos together where again and again, this is what happens.
[07:07:48.905 --> 07:07:54.671]  We had the CNN anchor shutting down comments when a guest was trying to bring up Bill Clinton's illegitimate son.
[07:07:54.691 --> 07:07:58.035]  He was saying, I'd love, I can't wait for your interview with Danny Williams.
[07:07:58.075 --> 07:07:59.977]  And she's like, ah, just no.
[07:08:00.337 --> 07:08:04.081]  And then there was another CNN panelist that immediately also shut it all down as a concern.
[07:08:04.141 --> 07:08:09.164]  Well, it's CNN that's plugging the narrative that it's illegal to look at WikiLeaks.
[07:08:09.184 --> 07:08:10.744]  They don't even want people to think that you can.
[07:08:11.025 --> 07:08:12.345]  By the way, that is not true.
[07:08:13.026 --> 07:08:16.828]  You absolutely have the right to look at this information, to view it, and to disseminate it.
[07:08:17.288 --> 07:08:25.452]  And if they can't get you to believe that it's illegal if you look at it, they're just going to totally black out any time anybody mentions it on the airwaves.
[07:08:25.532 --> 07:08:48.588]  Or just hope that you're never gonna fact-check them in real time, like Don Lemon saying that the tapes, the audio tapes of Hillary Clinton laughing about the fact that the rapist that she knew was guilty and helped get off, who raped and brutally beat up this 12-year-old girl into a coma, she knew he was guilty of it, and she was laughing on tape about it years later, the fact that he was able to pass this polygraph test.
[07:08:48.948 --> 07:08:51.150]  So, which means a lot of people are like, well, you know, as a
[07:08:51.630 --> 07:08:51.930]  Yes, we are.
[07:09:09.068 --> 07:09:09.569]  Years ago.
[07:09:09.629 --> 07:09:10.249]  These are real.
[07:09:10.269 --> 07:09:10.730]  They're real.
[07:09:10.910 --> 07:09:11.610]  They're legit.
[07:09:11.650 --> 07:09:19.137]  But Don Lemon, he wants all of his audience members out there to be dumbed down, compliant, ignorant, just like the Democrats like you.
[07:09:19.217 --> 07:09:23.200]  Well, that's what Bill Ivey said in one of these leaked WikiLeaks emails.
[07:09:23.260 --> 07:09:26.503]  He said that, you know, we need an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[07:09:26.863 --> 07:09:28.164]  They take full advantage of that.
[07:09:28.204 --> 07:09:34.089]  And the fact that people are waking up, they're tuning into us, Leigh-Anne, they're tuning into Alex, you know, they're just not going to take it anymore.
[07:09:34.189 --> 07:09:37.652]  I love this time in history that we're in currently, but it's amazing that
[07:09:37.932 --> 07:09:39.054]  They just think that they can say it.
[07:09:39.194 --> 07:09:40.156]  You know, nothing to see here.
[07:09:40.176 --> 07:09:40.877]  We need you dumb.
[07:09:41.178 --> 07:09:44.344]  So we're going to reiterate the narrative over and over and over and over.
[07:09:44.364 --> 07:09:46.047]  And you're just not going to know anything.
[07:09:46.668 --> 07:09:48.591]  No, it's really incredible to see.
[07:09:50.854 --> 07:10:07.600]  I mean, when Hillary Clinton called out Alex Jones during her speech on the alt-right, I ran over here and I was like, you guys, in real time, this is happening right now, she is talking about Alex Jones and she said he has a dark heart.
[07:10:07.940 --> 07:10:09.280]  Flushing her heart.
[07:10:09.820 --> 07:10:10.961]  Alex is super proud of that.
[07:10:11.001 --> 07:10:12.921]  He's like, I'm the dark heart, Alex Jones!
[07:10:14.462 --> 07:10:16.103]  I like roll Hillary Clinton!
[07:10:16.123 --> 07:10:17.503]  So he's super proud.
[07:10:17.863 --> 07:10:19.864]  Thank you, Hillary, for giving him yet another
[07:10:22.886 --> 07:10:24.687]  A little bit of flair there on his lapel.
[07:10:25.707 --> 07:10:26.988]  You talk about desperate.
[07:10:27.048 --> 07:10:29.109]  How desperate do you have to be?
[07:10:29.129 --> 07:10:34.091]  I mean, if the narrative isn't true that's coming out of InfoWars, why even acknowledge any of it?
[07:10:34.171 --> 07:10:35.652]  Why not just pass it on over?
[07:10:35.672 --> 07:10:39.514]  Do you really have to mention it in a national speech and clutch her heart?
[07:10:39.814 --> 07:10:43.676]  I mean, she was reaching for Hartley and I don't think she could find it, actually.
[07:10:44.156 --> 07:10:49.821]  Exactly, that she reached for her gaping hole that was in her chest where her heart and her feelings should be.
[07:10:49.841 --> 07:10:53.804]  You know, again, this is a lady who laughed about getting off a rapist who...
[07:10:54.824 --> 07:10:57.386]  Raped a girl, a 12-year-old girl, into a coma!
[07:10:57.947 --> 07:10:59.308]  But Alex has the dark heart.
[07:10:59.348 --> 07:11:00.449]  Yeah.
[07:11:00.649 --> 07:11:02.090]  She's a loving little grandma.
[07:11:02.210 --> 07:11:03.331]  She's sweet, she loves everyone.
[07:11:03.351 --> 07:11:11.498]  Now, one of the memos that we see there with the WikiLeaks is the fact that Google, we've reported on this as well, but again, people need proof.
[07:11:11.518 --> 07:11:14.080]  They're like, oh, send me a link, show me the documents, ugh.
[07:11:14.100 --> 07:11:21.245]  But even though now they've got the documents, they're saying, oh, I don't want to look into WikiLeaks because the Russians sent it and it's just not right.
[07:11:21.446 --> 07:11:21.706]  Right.
[07:11:23.328 --> 07:11:27.833]  The cognitive dissonance people just do not want their understanding of reality to be shattered.
[07:11:28.754 --> 07:11:37.685]  But we know Eric Schmidt, who is chief executive of Alphabet, Google's parent company now, is working directly with Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.
[07:11:38.366 --> 07:11:44.293]  And we've been saying, and Paul Joseph Watson has put up a lot of videos on this about how Google is messing with the algorithms.
[07:11:44.894 --> 07:11:52.843]  If you type in Hillary Clinton is a, you know, normally Google will give you tons of results based on what they think you're going to search for.
[07:11:52.863 --> 07:11:57.408]  And any other site that you go to, it'll say Hillary Clinton is a criminal.
[07:11:57.428 --> 07:11:58.369]  Correct, you know.
[07:11:59.150 --> 07:12:09.915]  Married to a rapist, whatever, but with Google it's like Hillary Clinton is an amazing woman and Hillary Clinton is just glowing things, obviously messing with the algorithm.
[07:12:10.555 --> 07:12:20.680]  But it's not just Google, it's also Facebook and Apple and all of these huge corporations in collusion with the Clinton campaign to get Hillary Clinton elected.
[07:12:20.960 --> 07:12:24.582]  And that's what people need to understand is it's bigger than Hillary Clinton.
[07:12:24.722 --> 07:12:25.683]  She represents
[07:12:26.423 --> 07:12:29.104]  A house of cards that is the establishment.
[07:12:29.184 --> 07:12:41.047]  And that's why we have so many people from every different industry trying to prop this woman up, literally carrying her in on her little gurney, hoping that she can just make it to the election cycle.
[07:12:41.647 --> 07:12:45.748]  And the mainstream media knows that they have become totally powerless.
[07:12:45.808 --> 07:12:47.649]  People do not believe them anymore.
[07:12:48.209 --> 07:12:52.291]  And so they need her to win because they're already seeing their power vaporize.
[07:12:52.351 --> 07:12:54.593]  And if she doesn't win, they're in trouble.
[07:12:54.613 --> 07:12:56.333]  They're in deep doo-doo, let me just tell you.
[07:12:56.353 --> 07:13:02.537]  But going back to the mainstream media, the reason they don't want to talk about WikiLeaks is because a lot of them are in fact indicted in these emails.
[07:13:02.657 --> 07:13:04.178]  It shows that they're in cahoots with her.
[07:13:04.218 --> 07:13:09.861]  It shows that they're in bed with, you know, the globalist Leigh-Anne, that they're not pro-America.
[07:13:09.901 --> 07:13:11.622]  You think CNN cares about you?
[07:13:12.262 --> 07:13:16.206]  No, it's the same agenda that Clinton has been spouting for two decades.
[07:13:16.646 --> 07:13:19.248]  It's a globalist, anti-American agenda.
[07:13:19.629 --> 07:13:23.352]  If you don't go along with it, all they have are mean little names, like name-calling.
[07:13:23.572 --> 07:13:24.914]  What is this, the third grade?
[07:13:25.354 --> 07:13:26.455]  It's just remarkable.
[07:13:26.475 --> 07:13:28.957]  But the reason I don't want this out, because they're all in bed.
[07:13:28.997 --> 07:13:30.639]  It just exposes them for what they are.
[07:13:30.759 --> 07:13:33.201]  Well, they're literally calling themselves hacks.
[07:13:33.561 --> 07:13:39.806]  That now that I've become a hack and I just write what I'm told, please let me know whether or not this meets your approval.
[07:13:40.067 --> 07:13:42.929]  And if you want to edit anything, just let me know and I'll send it to the printer.
[07:13:42.949 --> 07:13:44.911]  But don't tell anyone I did this for you.
[07:13:45.351 --> 07:13:50.175]  Or, you know, John Oliver, comedian John Oliver, oh he's so funny, he hasn't done yet a single pro
[07:13:52.757 --> 07:14:01.886]  Trump ad, it's all anti-Trump and pro-Hillary there on his new show, but gee, I'm sure he's just totally non-biased and just a really super intelligent person there.
[07:14:02.507 --> 07:14:08.513]  He's in collusion with the Clinton campaign, and New York Times is, the Politico, they all give them editing rights.
[07:14:09.834 --> 07:14:13.998]  Yeah, everyone there on CNN, they have their surrogates, people that they're having these
[07:14:14.759 --> 07:14:22.883]  Uh, private cocktail parties with and ooh, you better get in, sign up quick to be a part of Hillary Clinton's campaign so you can figure out how to spin stories for us.
[07:14:23.103 --> 07:14:30.146]  Oh, by the way, we'll give you stories to put out there so that you don't have to report on all of our scandals and the emails.
[07:14:30.226 --> 07:14:40.771]  I mean, literally that's in these documents where they're saying, here are some other stories that we want you to push out when it's a day that you have to talk about her scandals.
[07:14:41.901 --> 07:14:45.283]  Seriously, not only that, but okay, so let's look at the stories that they want pushed out.
[07:14:45.323 --> 07:14:49.186]  We want, you know, all of Trump's supporters are hateful, racist bigots.
[07:14:49.206 --> 07:14:51.607]  So how can we make this narrative plausible?
[07:14:51.667 --> 07:14:55.910]  We're going to hire some hateful, racist bigots.
[07:14:55.930 --> 07:14:57.330]  We're going to put them on the front line.
[07:14:57.451 --> 07:14:59.432]  We're actually propping them up and sponsoring.
[07:14:59.452 --> 07:15:00.673]  There's a story for you.
[07:15:00.693 --> 07:15:01.473]  Why doesn't anybody come?
[07:15:01.493 --> 07:15:02.814]  Never that one, I want to know.
[07:15:02.914 --> 07:15:11.437]  I mean, they're actually buying off the people that are hateful, racist bigots and propping them up, putting them in lines where normal people who just love our country are standing.
[07:15:12.137 --> 07:15:13.398]  But the media is never going to cover that.
[07:15:13.478 --> 07:15:17.159]  And the quid pro quo that Hillary is famous for, I think it's so funny.
[07:15:17.199 --> 07:15:21.801]  Some of these media types are like, well, throw me the first question or give me first dibs on this.
[07:15:21.901 --> 07:15:23.202]  It's like, that's your payment?
[07:15:23.722 --> 07:15:25.103]  Ask for more than that.
[07:15:25.243 --> 07:15:25.863]  Come on.
[07:15:26.283 --> 07:15:27.964]  Right, that's something I'd be interested in.
[07:15:27.984 --> 07:15:39.950]  I mean, since we've been calling out in real time Hillary Clinton's all of her things, you know, who is the mysterious guy with the folder there at the podium, when she was doing all this, oh, signaling.
[07:15:39.990 --> 07:15:40.751]  Her inside baseball.
[07:15:40.771 --> 07:15:45.013]  She didn't do that during the next debate, and frankly, the last debate she didn't get any zingers in.
[07:15:45.453 --> 07:15:52.057]  She didn't have her questions ahead of time, she didn't have her little hand gestures to the moderators, and the moderators did everything they could
[07:15:52.697 --> 07:15:52.997]  Wow.
[07:15:53.017 --> 07:15:57.339]  Like Trump said, it was three against one, so it'll be interesting to see what happens in tonight's debate.
[07:15:57.599 --> 07:15:57.860]  Correct.
[07:15:57.880 --> 07:15:59.180]  It is in Vegas where, you know.
[07:15:59.220 --> 07:16:01.761]  You know, the heavyweight champ, the gloves are off.
[07:16:01.861 --> 07:16:02.522]  I love that.
[07:16:02.622 --> 07:16:04.543]  You pointed this out, it is in Las Vegas.
[07:16:04.583 --> 07:16:08.465]  So Trump is famous for attending fights in Las Vegas.
[07:16:08.525 --> 07:16:11.866]  I remember looking at articles where he would be sitting on the front row of the bloodiest fights.
[07:16:12.387 --> 07:16:17.609]  I am anticipating one of the most bloody, you know, bloody fights we have ever seen tonight coming.
[07:16:17.649 --> 07:16:19.490]  It's appropriate that it's in Las Vegas.
[07:16:19.690 --> 07:16:19.870]  I know.
[07:16:19.890 --> 07:16:20.631]  It just couldn't get better.
[07:16:20.651 --> 07:16:21.732]  Yeah, you're right.
[07:16:21.792 --> 07:16:25.695]  Some people there, hopefully David Knight has got some ringside seats for that.
[07:16:26.375 --> 07:16:30.578]  We'll be speaking with him in about 15-20 minutes if he's able to get a good signal with us.
[07:16:31.679 --> 07:16:34.181]  Should we go ahead and play the Nigel Farage piece again?
[07:16:34.241 --> 07:16:36.183]  I know we'd like to kind of get that out
[07:16:36.883 --> 07:16:42.431]  To the people so they can really watch it, let it sink in as much as humanly possible before this debate tonight.
[07:16:43.893 --> 07:16:48.059]  But let's talk about, you know, what else did you think about some of these revelations?
[07:16:48.319 --> 07:16:48.700]  Okay.
[07:16:48.880 --> 07:16:52.585]  A lot of these Dem operatives, like you were mentioning with these violent protests.
[07:16:52.585 --> 07:16:53.466]  Protesters.
[07:16:53.726 --> 07:17:08.042]  What I found, okay, so what I found really remarkable, obviously WikiLeaks is getting no coverage, that's the story in and of itself, but the revelations that are coming out of WikiLeaks, how they really feel about you and I, the American people, they hate our guts, let me just tell you.
[07:17:08.082 --> 07:17:10.384]  They don't love you, they couldn't care less about you.
[07:17:10.925 --> 07:17:13.767]  And they all have this agenda, and they need to keep us dumb and stupid.
[07:17:13.787 --> 07:17:15.908]  That's a major revelation in and of itself.
[07:17:16.368 --> 07:17:25.694]  We know that more information is coming out about Hillary Clinton, and people like Matt Drudge, they're holding it until the very last moment they can hold it to have the most impact.
[07:17:26.314 --> 07:17:32.897]  Dredge is sending out these cryptic tweets, if you will, and one of them is regarding Clinton's sexuality.
[07:17:32.937 --> 07:17:37.900]  Now, we know that she's famous for calling Trump this sexual aggressor.
[07:17:37.960 --> 07:17:40.161]  If she can't paint that well, well, he hates women.
[07:17:40.661 --> 07:17:47.045]  And really trying to establish him in an American psyche as this womanizer.
[07:17:47.065 --> 07:17:48.485]  And I cannot wait.
[07:17:48.545 --> 07:17:50.166]  How does she live with herself?
[07:17:50.186 --> 07:17:51.727]  She lives with a womanizer!
[07:17:51.887 --> 07:17:54.649]  No, not only that, but she might be a womanizer herself.
[07:17:55.849 --> 07:17:57.170]  Words, word on the street.
[07:17:57.190 --> 07:17:57.871]  Word on the street.
[07:17:57.911 --> 07:17:59.432]  She's a pretty aggressive butch.
[07:18:00.012 --> 07:18:01.693]  Is that she?
[07:18:02.134 --> 07:18:03.255]  And I cannot wait.
[07:18:03.275 --> 07:18:04.535]  Sorry about that visual.
[07:18:04.555 --> 07:18:04.976]  Me too.
[07:18:05.076 --> 07:18:06.157]  But we had to put that out there.
[07:18:06.177 --> 07:18:08.738]  So Drudge, you know, he's dangled the bait.
[07:18:08.899 --> 07:18:11.500]  I keep messaging on Twitter, when are you doing this?
[07:18:11.601 --> 07:18:12.361]  When are you doing this?
[07:18:12.421 --> 07:18:17.665]  And look, there's nothing wrong with, you know, we love all people, far and wide, just the same.
[07:18:17.685 --> 07:18:23.609]  But if somebody is closeting while pointing the finger at somebody else, at least be who you are.
[07:18:23.629 --> 07:18:23.729]  Right.
[07:18:24.970 --> 07:18:27.171]  If you don't have anything to hide, at least be who you are.
[07:18:38.956 --> 07:18:41.397]  Don't pretend to be something you're not forever and ever.
[07:18:41.417 --> 07:18:43.397]  But even that I think she would be celebrated for.
[07:18:43.457 --> 07:18:47.438]  For finally coming out and not for being a total phony and a liar for decades.
[07:18:47.538 --> 07:18:47.858]  Right.
[07:18:48.038 --> 07:18:53.580]  And somehow she would be a victim who was, you know, I could see this already being spent in a way that's ridiculous.
[07:18:53.600 --> 07:18:55.380]  I'm sure they've already prepared for that.
[07:18:55.760 --> 07:18:57.581]  They've already worked all through the coming out.
[07:18:57.641 --> 07:18:58.361]  What should they do?
[07:18:58.541 --> 07:19:01.283]  This is like an Eminem album.
[07:19:01.383 --> 07:19:03.525]  We should call it, Who is Hillary Clinton?
[07:19:04.446 --> 07:19:08.269]  We know very little about this lady except for what's coming out of her emails.
[07:19:08.689 --> 07:19:09.830]  She's famously private.
[07:19:10.030 --> 07:19:13.373]  She is nothing that she claims to be at all.
[07:19:13.473 --> 07:19:15.855]  What we see is that she has an army of staffers.
[07:19:19.878 --> 07:19:27.686]  Every single move she makes, thought that she thinks, probably before she even thinks it, is so calculated, so scripted.
[07:19:27.986 --> 07:19:43.642]  That's why she has all of her staffers working through her speeches going, Hillary doesn't like that because there's no way she can make it seem believable that when she says, you know, just like Mr. and Mrs. America there on the street, just your average American, she's like, I can't
[07:19:44.102 --> 07:19:45.282]  I can't relate to that.
[07:19:45.322 --> 07:19:48.043]  I can't say I'm just your average American out there.
[07:19:48.063 --> 07:19:48.783]  That's not me.
[07:19:48.943 --> 07:19:49.603]  Absolutely not.
[07:19:49.643 --> 07:19:51.843]  Not only that, Liam, but she is anything but.
[07:19:52.184 --> 07:19:54.524]  She's this elitist snob.
[07:19:54.584 --> 07:19:56.584]  You know, that's another revelation that we're getting.
[07:19:56.624 --> 07:20:00.525]  And it had been, you know, the latest dump, you really have to sort through these leaks.
[07:20:01.085 --> 07:20:08.527]  When you find little gems of how she really feels about you and I, how she wants herself to look, how corrupt that she is, what she's done to different countries.
[07:20:08.827 --> 07:20:10.827]  You know, we were we've looked a lot at Haiti this week.
[07:20:11.187 --> 07:20:11.707]  I think so.
[07:20:31.095 --> 07:20:52.770]  He holds these massive contracts, she's done very little, and then he stages this strike in this oil company that he had part ownership in to make sure that it went bankrupt and collapsed, not actually helping any of the workers that she's touting to have helped, you know, taking full advantage of the fact that on the ground in Colombia, you know, massive war in terms of drug wars going on, been ravaging the country for decades.
[07:20:53.530 --> 07:20:54.972]  Instability, poverty.
[07:20:55.393 --> 07:20:56.554]  Oh, that's an opportunity.
[07:20:56.614 --> 07:20:59.097]  You talk about an opportunist.
[07:20:59.217 --> 07:21:01.420]  It doesn't begin to describe this woman.
[07:21:01.560 --> 07:21:08.970]  Right, and I believe Guster was able to set up his companies in a way that he kind of got around some loopholes, of course, that they try to blame Trump.
[07:21:09.070 --> 07:21:10.372]  Oh, you took advantage of a loophole.
[07:21:10.592 --> 07:21:11.593]  That's all they know how to do.
[07:21:11.953 --> 07:21:26.585]  So that he was able to take all of these different plots of land, even though the government says you're not allowed to own X amount, and he's taking the land that the government has set aside for the peasants to work on, to be able to, you know, grow their food or what have you.
[07:21:26.665 --> 07:21:26.906]  Right.
[07:21:26.926 --> 07:21:30.709]  So they're going in, helping these people while completely exploiting them.
[07:21:30.989 --> 07:21:32.610]  That's exactly what they've done in Haiti.
[07:21:33.171 --> 07:21:36.454]  The ground literally broke open there with an earthquake, killing
[07:21:37.174 --> 07:21:43.856]  Untold amounts of people and they saw, wow, look at all the resources there with this ground being broken.
[07:21:44.036 --> 07:21:45.376]  Look, there's a lot of gold there.
[07:21:45.396 --> 07:21:47.177]  There's a lot of gold there!
[07:21:47.197 --> 07:21:55.739]  I'm going to allow my brother to oversee the company that's going to pull the gold, siphon all the resources out of Haiti, and then we'll give you guys, we'll throw you guys a bone.
[07:21:56.299 --> 07:22:01.040]  And Rob Dew makes a great point that they had billions of dollars, yet they didn't spend any of that
[07:22:01.460 --> 07:22:17.147]  Money on rebuilding the infrastructure there of Haiti so that this time around with this latest hurricane completely devastated areas and you know Joe Biggs was talking about the crew that just died that was trying to go there last night to go deliver some goods to Haiti I mean that just
[07:22:18.127 --> 07:22:18.928]  It breaks your heart.
[07:22:19.308 --> 07:22:20.908]  That could have been our guys out there.
[07:22:20.928 --> 07:22:28.572]  It really hits close to home and you have people like Gary Haven who are spending his own money, his own plane, his own time going out there doing that.
[07:22:28.592 --> 07:22:29.613]  He's not on Sex Island.
[07:22:29.673 --> 07:22:30.853]  He's not with Bill Clinton.
[07:22:30.933 --> 07:22:35.295]  He's aiding impoverished women and children who are dying on the ground.
[07:22:35.655 --> 07:22:40.098]  You mentioned this, the crew dying just to get there and do this work that they're doing.
[07:22:40.118 --> 07:22:40.818]  They're putting themselves
[07:22:41.038 --> 07:22:43.020]  But the Clintons had every opportunity.
[07:22:43.060 --> 07:22:44.401]  They had every resource.
[07:22:44.421 --> 07:22:46.823]  They had people donating in the tens of millions.
[07:22:47.283 --> 07:22:57.771]  And they're such disgusting opportunists that not only do they not help, but they then help everybody who's helped them continue to take from an already impoverished people.
[07:22:57.791 --> 07:22:59.293]  It's despicable.
[07:22:59.953 --> 07:23:07.137]  It is despicable, and just to kind of underscore that, and to just let people out there see how messed up this is.
[07:23:07.838 --> 07:23:10.819]  So, Haiti, once again, totally devastated.
[07:23:11.000 --> 07:23:14.902]  You would think that the media would be all over this, just like they were last time around.
[07:23:15.322 --> 07:23:25.910]  But they're not, because drawing attention to that, what's happened there, would draw attention to how little the Clinton Foundation has done for Haiti the last time around.
[07:23:25.930 --> 07:23:32.114]  So they're not even covering what's happening in Haiti, because that's how much they want to protect Hillary Clinton.
[07:23:32.474 --> 07:23:37.618]  They don't want to draw attention to her foundation that has done jack squat for that country.
[07:23:38.058 --> 07:23:39.399]  That's how messed up this is.
[07:23:39.519 --> 07:23:44.723]  That's why people are frustrated, they're angry, because they can't get the truth even though we are awake.
[07:23:44.943 --> 07:23:46.785]  We know innately the truth.
[07:23:46.825 --> 07:23:52.289]  We all have, we're born with a truth meter and it's really being jammed right now.
[07:23:52.329 --> 07:23:57.993]  The signal is being jammed because there is a massive PSYOP campaign at every single angle.
[07:23:58.493 --> 07:24:03.277]  After this election, people, I mean, you already should have your televisions turned off.
[07:24:03.737 --> 07:24:12.648]  But if this is what it takes for people to understand just how messed up the system is, what a huge PSYOP campaign, all the propaganda they're pumping out.
[07:24:12.988 --> 07:24:23.461]  You and your families truly need to go back to playing board games at night with your neighbors, with the TVs shut down, and truly let them know, you know what, we're not going to buy into your massive campaign.
[07:24:23.641 --> 07:24:31.363]  Even your stupid television shows where the government goes in and gives the script writers talking points to push their agenda.
[07:24:31.684 --> 07:24:36.185]  So it's not like you can just not watch the news and you'll be totally fine and safe from this propaganda.
[07:24:36.545 --> 07:24:44.587]  They're writing it into the Hollywood scripts, into the movies, into this... You think you're going to go get some comedy from John Oliver?
[07:24:44.607 --> 07:24:45.668]  You just want to go laugh?
[07:24:46.428 --> 07:24:54.231]  Freaking Amy Schumer had about 200 plus people storm out of her comedy show the other night because she started to get political and bash Trump.
[07:24:54.651 --> 07:24:58.212]  You know, it's like you can't even enjoy yourselves because it's everywhere and it's this propaganda.
[07:24:58.732 --> 07:25:00.853]  Madonna, shut up lady!
[07:25:00.933 --> 07:25:07.315]  I mean, she's almost 70 talking about giving oral sex in exchange for votes for Hillary Clinton.
[07:25:07.335 --> 07:25:08.756]  Yet that's fine.
[07:25:09.036 --> 07:25:10.256]  That's progressive.
[07:25:10.316 --> 07:25:12.757]  She's an empowered woman offering that up.
[07:25:12.777 --> 07:25:14.638]  But when Trump dares say something...
[07:25:15.658 --> 07:25:16.199]  I am shocked.
[07:25:16.399 --> 07:25:17.399]  He's just offensive.
[07:25:17.920 --> 07:25:23.644]  Look, you know, and I saw her tearing up because we understand what's at stake here.
[07:25:23.924 --> 07:25:25.205]  We love this country.
[07:25:25.245 --> 07:25:27.046]  We love you listening to us right now.
[07:25:27.567 --> 07:25:29.808]  And we understand what's at stake.
[07:25:29.868 --> 07:25:30.469]  We get it.
[07:25:30.529 --> 07:25:31.470]  You know, and it's scary.
[07:25:31.510 --> 07:25:32.891]  It's frightening to see this.
[07:25:32.951 --> 07:25:36.113]  And, you know, we had somebody on earlier today.
[07:25:36.213 --> 07:25:37.034]  He's a naturalist.
[07:25:37.094 --> 07:25:37.854]  He was like, you know what?
[07:25:38.034 --> 07:25:39.195]  Keep your stress level down.
[07:25:39.656 --> 07:25:40.536]  Life will go on.
[07:25:40.937 --> 07:25:42.938]  But people need to understand what's at stake.
[07:25:43.098 --> 07:26:01.273]  We're at a war, Leigh-Anne, and life will go on if she's elected, God forbid, but we have an opportunity to really do something amazing and to change the direction and the course of our nation, not only for us, but for our children, our grandchildren, and you're a part of that.
[07:26:01.313 --> 07:26:04.155]  You listening to this, you're an absolute intricate part of that.
[07:26:04.555 --> 07:26:07.278]  It can't be done without you, and it's time to stand up.
[07:26:08.058 --> 07:26:20.163]  At the very least, shutting off the television in the event that she does manage to wiggle through, either through election rigging or corruption or every other tool that she's used in her toolkit before.
[07:26:20.203 --> 07:26:24.905]  If she could do it again, God forbid, but we're in the precipice of an opportunity here.
[07:26:24.925 --> 07:26:25.585]  We want to seize it.
[07:26:25.605 --> 07:26:26.445]  We're exhausted.
[07:26:26.485 --> 07:26:27.385]  We're tearing up.
[07:26:27.686 --> 07:26:31.807]  We're right in the thick of this, but it's just where we are right now.
[07:26:31.847 --> 07:26:33.108]  People really need to understand that.
[07:26:33.148 --> 07:26:33.688]  I think they do.
[07:26:34.248 --> 07:26:42.474]  We really are on a precipice and that's why people are so shaken up because they do realize how important these times are that we're living in.
[07:26:43.014 --> 07:26:53.982]  Either way, everyone does just need to take a deep breath and know that ultimately God has our best interests at heart and you know maybe it might be really tough times but I believe at the end it's all going to be for the best.
[07:26:54.662 --> 07:26:54.982]  I don't know.
[07:27:09.599 --> 07:27:09.679]  Well
[07:27:26.101 --> 07:27:40.228]  Just looking at the prosperity message that he has for this country, I legitimately believe he cares about jobs, he cares about your family, and he wants to see Americans prosper, not this globalist structure prosper at your expense.
[07:27:40.828 --> 07:27:46.291]  And rest assured that's exactly, this woman does not have your best interest at heart, let me tell you.
[07:27:46.611 --> 07:27:49.873]  The ghettos have gotten poorer under Barack Obama, that's going to continue.
[07:27:50.213 --> 07:27:55.236]  You know, when you want to see a country and how badly it's hurting, you just go to a ghetto, and I am telling you, it is
[07:27:55.956 --> 07:28:02.919]  We are at a nightmare level in terms of poverty in this nation, but we're still busting people in by the hundreds of thousands.
[07:28:03.719 --> 07:28:15.723]  Where do they think they're going to... And straight up telling people who are begging and have been begging for years for a little bit of help in Detroit and other cities, telling them, we're going to rebuild your city with Syrian refugees.
[07:28:15.903 --> 07:28:17.184]  We don't trust you to do it.
[07:28:17.384 --> 07:28:20.145]  People who are illegal immigrants to this nation who
[07:28:21.045 --> 07:28:25.090]  Have already broken the law to get here and don't care to become an American citizen.
[07:28:25.110 --> 07:28:26.251]  They don't even want to.
[07:28:26.271 --> 07:28:27.272]  They disrespect us.
[07:28:27.332 --> 07:28:28.193]  Death to America.
[07:28:28.213 --> 07:28:35.141]  We're going to rebuild America with them because they're easier to control because they want the government handout and they don't care about our laws.
[07:28:35.161 --> 07:28:36.222]  They don't care about the Constitution.
[07:28:36.262 --> 07:28:36.643]  Whatever.
[07:28:36.683 --> 07:28:37.584]  Do whatever you guys want.
[07:28:38.044 --> 07:28:40.587]  Just make sure I get my government handout and I'm fine.
[07:28:54.361 --> 07:28:58.703]  That's under Barack Obama.
[07:28:59.043 --> 07:29:00.783]  We're talking about a hungry nation here.
[07:29:00.803 --> 07:29:02.064]  We're talking about a poor nation.
[07:29:02.084 --> 07:29:07.986]  You know, the average income, the median household income for an American family, it fluctuates.
[07:29:08.626 --> 07:29:11.187]  On some level it's $32,000 or $32,500.
[07:29:11.227 --> 07:29:15.108]  I was looking at this and I'm like, how are people surviving in this economy?
[07:29:15.268 --> 07:29:18.449]  And, you know, it's just like, get ready and brace yourself because it's about to get
[07:29:18.829 --> 07:29:20.870]  First, if that's possible.
[07:29:21.090 --> 07:29:21.330]  Right.
[07:29:21.510 --> 07:29:35.135]  And that's why, you know, we do continue to say, get yourselves, your family, your neighbors, start growing a garden, start getting yourself self-sustainable so that you don't need these people who do not have your best interests at heart.
[07:29:35.175 --> 07:29:39.857]  You don't need them to take care of you and to give you their little meager handouts.
[07:29:39.917 --> 07:29:41.297]  We can take care of ourselves.
[07:29:41.557 --> 07:29:42.658]  We can take care of our own.
[07:29:42.698 --> 07:29:45.039]  We can take care of our neighbors, our family, our friends.
[07:29:45.599 --> 07:29:47.540]  And, you know, that's what we've got to get back to.
[07:29:47.640 --> 07:29:48.320]  True liberty!
[07:29:48.700 --> 07:29:52.022]  True liberty, where we're free, we can take care of ourselves.
[07:29:52.322 --> 07:29:56.085]  We don't need big government in every single aspect of our lives.
[07:29:56.425 --> 07:29:58.446]  That's what's at stake here with this election.
[07:29:58.747 --> 07:30:00.208]  And yeah, life is gonna go on.
[07:30:00.228 --> 07:30:04.070]  I mean, crazy bad times have happened throughout history.
[07:30:04.430 --> 07:30:07.973]  And somehow humanity survived, humanity has thrived.
[07:30:08.413 --> 07:30:13.997]  But America, this big experiment that we're in here, there's never been anything like it.
[07:30:14.517 --> 07:30:17.039]  And it's almost as if it's just too great.
[07:30:18.039 --> 07:30:19.199]  Or the powers that be.
[07:30:19.820 --> 07:30:21.400]  Unfortunately, the powers that be.
[07:30:21.560 --> 07:30:24.781]  They don't want to see everyone rise up and become as great as they are.
[07:30:24.801 --> 07:30:26.442]  Hey, McAdoo, I hate to interrupt you here.
[07:30:26.622 --> 07:30:28.642]  It looks like we may have an interesting situation.
[07:30:28.662 --> 07:30:30.303]  This is Rob doing the control room right now.
[07:30:31.123 --> 07:30:35.845]  At 6 o'clock today, at our time, so that would be 4 o'clock,
[07:30:38.086 --> 07:30:38.547]  Vegas time.
[07:30:38.567 --> 07:30:39.147]  Vegas time.
[07:30:39.608 --> 07:30:40.909]  Danny Williams is supposed to have a conference.
[07:30:40.949 --> 07:30:42.171]  Now it's 17 minutes late.
[07:30:42.651 --> 07:30:43.753]  There's been some chicanery.
[07:30:44.033 --> 07:30:44.874]  And here's the press conference.
[07:30:44.894 --> 07:30:45.795]  We're going to go live with it right now.
[07:30:45.815 --> 07:30:46.776]  This is from Right Side Media.
[07:30:46.796 --> 07:30:47.838]  Let's just see what's going on now.
[07:30:54.005 --> 07:30:54.465]  We're good to go.
[07:31:21.232 --> 07:31:26.793]  Yeah, and one of the bigger surprises last week I thought was, or the whole season really, was Cathedral getting beat by Brebeuf.
[07:31:27.233 --> 07:31:32.455]  Brebeuf came back, they were down 17-7, came back and beat them 24-17.
[07:31:32.855 --> 07:31:37.516]  And, you know, Cathedral's been fighting some injuries all year, as Center Grove has too, obviously, with Titus McCoy.
[07:31:37.916 --> 07:31:39.916]  But again, that was just kind of surprising.
[07:31:39.996 --> 07:31:43.497]  I'm curious to see how Cathedral, both these teams have been pretty good defensively all year.
[07:31:44.177 --> 07:31:47.018]  Even in that loss to Brebeuf, Cathedral has gained about two points.
[07:31:47.578 --> 07:31:50.079]  We'll go back to Danny Williams' press conference.
[07:32:21.475 --> 07:32:28.203]  I'm here to give my statement as far as Bill Clinton being my father.
[07:32:28.223 --> 07:32:35.951]  I have compelling reasons to believe that I am the biological son of former President Jefferson Clinton, also known as Bill Clinton.
[07:32:36.651 --> 07:32:43.779]  I am simply seeking the truth and that I respectfully request
[07:32:44.651 --> 07:32:46.273]  I'm seeking the truth.
[07:32:46.934 --> 07:32:58.406]  Respectfully requesting that former President Pence submit a court-verbal sample of his DNA to the Federal Courts of Appeal.
[07:33:00.168 --> 07:33:03.851]  Now we know Jack kind of let us know what was going to be happening here with this lawsuit.
[07:33:03.871 --> 07:33:06.653]  They're saying we want a TNA test.
[07:33:06.893 --> 07:33:12.497]  A couple days afterward, if we don't give it, then the lawsuit's going to come.
[07:33:12.517 --> 07:33:19.322]  Anybody else in America accused of maternity, fathering a child, they would be forced to do that.
[07:33:19.362 --> 07:33:22.044]  Because it's a Clinton, this is what it's come to.
[07:33:29.574 --> 07:33:33.695]  And we know, we interviewed Danny before, he gets very nervous, so I can imagine all the flashing cameras.
[07:33:33.735 --> 07:33:38.537]  All my life I've been told Bill Clinton, my father, my mother's story has never changed.
[07:33:39.737 --> 07:33:44.479]  My aunts, I have a big family, my whole family know what it is.
[07:33:44.959 --> 07:33:57.783]  All my life we've been going through this and most of the artists I know, everywhere I go people say, this Bill Clinton son, he look just like him.
[07:33:59.173 --> 07:34:10.540]  But basically I'm just here to tell the truth about who I am and to get a legitimate paternity suit against Bills for him to give a sample of his DNA.
[07:34:13.482 --> 07:34:18.225]  I mean, do you have any questions?
[07:34:26.538 --> 07:34:27.519]  I have not waited long.
[07:34:27.639 --> 07:34:28.339]  I've been trying.
[07:34:28.980 --> 07:34:30.881]  I've been reaching out all the 90s, all 2000.
[07:34:31.241 --> 07:34:36.164]  I mean, why have the media just now approaching this story?
[07:34:36.184 --> 07:34:36.665]  I don't know.
[07:34:36.725 --> 07:34:40.447]  As far as I've been trying all my life to prove this.
[07:34:41.387 --> 07:34:43.689]  I've been doing this since I was nine years old.
[07:34:43.929 --> 07:34:48.492]  So, I mean, I haven't just now come out with this.
[07:34:48.672 --> 07:34:53.435]  I come out with my Facebook and my Twitter of me and Bill two and a half years ago.
[07:34:54.557 --> 07:34:55.378]  I'm trying to reach out.
[07:34:56.018 --> 07:34:59.981]  And I didn't email some letters to his library.
[07:35:00.021 --> 07:35:02.883]  I didn't Google addresses to New York on him.
[07:35:03.784 --> 07:35:09.208]  And I tried to reach out for him to step up and take a test without all of this publicity.
[07:35:10.669 --> 07:35:12.170]  But, you know, no one responded.
[07:35:12.470 --> 07:35:13.111]  That's not true.
[07:35:13.231 --> 07:35:15.833]  I started asking you for interviews over a year ago.
[07:35:15.853 --> 07:35:17.614]  I'm Olivia Mitzi from the Daily Beast.
[07:35:17.634 --> 07:35:20.076]  Oh, I'm Olivia Mitzi and I'm trying to talk to you.
[07:35:20.116 --> 07:35:21.017]  Oh, I hate that girl.
[07:35:21.057 --> 07:35:22.638]  What are you talking about?
[07:35:23.985 --> 07:35:26.026]  One- She demonizes everyone.
[07:35:26.106 --> 07:35:30.327]  I don't know who you are, and I don't- I just told you, I'm one of the new secrets of the Daily Beast.
[07:35:30.367 --> 07:35:33.008]  He just asked you to do an interview.
[07:35:33.068 --> 07:35:34.148]  Okay, and I will do an interview.
[07:35:34.168 --> 07:35:38.390]  I mean, I didn't- I got people work- Right, that's why I'm here now.
[07:35:38.530 --> 07:35:40.830]  I got people work, you know- Why not a year ago?
[07:35:41.270 --> 07:35:42.011]  Why not a year ago?
[07:35:42.091 --> 07:35:45.972]  I mean, I wouldn't have done it a year ago.
[07:35:46.072 --> 07:35:49.713]  I'm not- I've been trying to talk to you for- Okay, I apologize for ignoring you.
[07:35:49.813 --> 07:35:50.893]  I never meant to ignore you.
[07:35:55.057 --> 07:35:57.920]  I mean... Can you speak for yourself or do you need somebody to speak for you?
[07:35:57.940 --> 07:35:59.062]  I can speak for myself, yes ma'am.
[07:36:00.263 --> 07:36:02.185]  Like, when I first come out here, I've been busy.
[07:36:02.926 --> 07:36:04.288]  Don't nobody help me raise my kids.
[07:36:04.348 --> 07:36:05.469]  I take care of my own kids.
[07:36:05.509 --> 07:36:09.834]  So, like now, I had to lose my job on doing this, coming here.
[07:36:09.914 --> 07:36:15.761]  So, it was hard on me just to get up and leave and go do these interviews, but...
[07:36:16.952 --> 07:36:17.453]  I don't know.
[07:36:17.473 --> 07:36:18.333]  I must have looked over it.
[07:36:18.433 --> 07:36:19.534]  I would have reached out to you.
[07:36:19.954 --> 07:36:20.435]  We talked.
[07:36:20.495 --> 07:36:21.476]  We talked on Facebook chat.
[07:36:21.556 --> 07:36:22.797]  I don't know if you remember.
[07:36:23.597 --> 07:36:26.820]  You repeatedly, for those requests, attested your lawyer.
[07:36:26.880 --> 07:36:29.982]  So I'm just wondering why you're only coming out now to talk to the media.
[07:36:30.022 --> 07:36:30.923]  Why not a year ago?
[07:36:31.123 --> 07:36:32.764]  Why not do a DNA test a year ago?
[07:36:34.065 --> 07:36:37.608]  Well, I've been trying to do this way longer than a year ago.
[07:36:38.269 --> 07:36:40.170]  So, it's not why not a year ago.
[07:36:40.791 --> 07:36:43.593]  I don't remember you responding to me or nothing, but
[07:36:45.430 --> 07:36:45.890]  I'm here now.
[07:36:46.771 --> 07:36:52.475]  Back in 1899 in New York, there's a New York Daily News that said that there was a turning test.
[07:36:52.816 --> 07:36:53.076]  Correct.
[07:36:53.116 --> 07:36:55.638]  And yet that was based on a false report from the star.
[07:36:55.958 --> 07:36:56.378]  Correct.
[07:36:56.418 --> 07:36:57.599]  So that's 17 years ago?
[07:36:57.920 --> 07:36:58.260]  Correct.
[07:36:58.300 --> 07:37:01.943]  They have no evidence today of nothing.
[07:37:02.303 --> 07:37:03.083]  I went to them.
[07:37:03.143 --> 07:37:09.929]  I asked them could they, you know, give me something on paper saying what was done to prove that they've done it.
[07:37:10.349 --> 07:37:11.270]  They have no evidence.
[07:37:11.290 --> 07:37:12.951]  They cannot give nothing to me.
[07:37:14.017 --> 07:37:16.159]  Uh, so, you know... At the time?
[07:37:16.179 --> 07:37:16.479]  Yeah.
[07:37:16.519 --> 07:37:16.800]  Yes, sir.
[07:37:16.900 --> 07:37:22.965]  I don't... I don't know... I mean, as a child, as a kid, I don't... I don't correctly know.
[07:37:35.839 --> 07:37:36.740]  I'm here today, though.
[07:37:36.780 --> 07:37:37.020]  Sure.
[07:37:37.460 --> 07:37:38.781]  Ready to submit a DNA.
[07:37:39.421 --> 07:37:45.665]  But from what I understand, the original DNA that they got was something that was released by Ken Starr, and it was not conclusive because it's not specific enough.
[07:37:45.965 --> 07:37:51.408]  There's two different types of DNA material, and he only released the non-specific type for some reason.
[07:37:51.808 --> 07:37:52.169]  Correct.
[07:37:52.329 --> 07:37:55.290]  And the Starr has said that there was no DNA test.
[07:37:55.530 --> 07:37:55.771]  Correct.
[07:37:56.954 --> 07:38:00.556]  Have you been in touch with the Trump campaign or any other Republican organizations about this?
[07:38:00.696 --> 07:38:05.319]  No, I have not been in touch with no Trump campaign, no one of them.
[07:38:05.739 --> 07:38:09.842]  I come out on my own, and I've been trying to come out all my life, so.
[07:38:11.343 --> 07:38:14.645]  Did anyone help you sort of come to Vegas or fund this trip for you?
[07:38:14.665 --> 07:38:16.506]  No, me and my guys, we worked together.
[07:38:17.608 --> 07:38:24.330]  My guy, he worked, and my friend worked, but we started saving money to fund our trip ourselves.
[07:38:24.610 --> 07:38:25.231]  Who are your guys?
[07:38:25.291 --> 07:38:26.271]  Can you meet them?
[07:38:26.291 --> 07:38:27.572]  My name is Steven Gray.
[07:38:27.892 --> 07:38:28.052]  Right.
[07:38:28.092 --> 07:38:29.052]  I'm Roland Brown.
[07:38:29.432 --> 07:38:39.216]  And both of us are National Public Administration majors, so we raise money amongst our families, amongst people in Little Rock, Arkansas, the community, in order to get money to come down here.
[07:38:39.756 --> 07:38:44.397]  Because none of us are wealthy, all of us come from low-income families and neighborhoods.
[07:38:44.417 --> 07:38:45.718]  We've lived in poverty all our life.
[07:38:46.809 --> 07:38:47.149]  Correct.
[07:38:47.189 --> 07:38:49.011]  Can you explain your role with Roger Stone?
[07:38:49.051 --> 07:38:50.372]  What is your relationship with him?
[07:38:50.613 --> 07:38:52.795]  I don't have no relationship with Roger Stone.
[07:38:53.195 --> 07:38:54.696]  You're featured prominently in his book.
[07:38:54.716 --> 07:38:55.717]  I actually read his book.
[07:38:55.817 --> 07:38:58.020]  And like I said, I come out to him 20 years ago.
[07:38:58.060 --> 07:38:59.721]  I did not know he was putting me in his book.
[07:39:00.041 --> 07:39:05.547]  So when I read that he was in my book, I tried to reach out to get help on my situation.
[07:39:06.007 --> 07:39:06.868]  But, you know,
[07:39:15.059 --> 07:39:16.460]  None of them, so- You've never talked to him?
[07:39:16.480 --> 07:39:17.541]  I talked to him once.
[07:39:17.561 --> 07:39:26.947]  I tried to reach out, but he never reached me back, so I don't know what's going on with that, so- Have you had any contact with the Trump campaign?
[07:39:26.967 --> 07:39:28.508]  No, never had contact with the country.
[07:39:28.808 --> 07:39:30.489]  I never had contact with the Trump campaign.
[07:39:30.509 --> 07:39:31.630]  Do they know that you're here today?
[07:39:32.050 --> 07:39:32.250]  No.
[07:39:33.991 --> 07:39:34.732]  Are you a Trump supporter?
[07:39:35.252 --> 07:39:35.472]  No.
[07:39:36.533 --> 07:39:37.514]  Am I a Hillary supporter?
[07:39:37.554 --> 07:39:37.634]  No.
[07:39:37.654 --> 07:39:39.275]  Who will you be voting for?
[07:39:39.295 --> 07:39:39.435]  No one.
[07:39:41.308 --> 07:39:49.452]  Do you have any evidence other than sort of your mom's stories and what other people in Arkansas say that you're- Yes, ma'am, I was there when they delivered presents.
[07:39:49.952 --> 07:39:52.013]  I remember the money delivered to my home.
[07:39:52.033 --> 07:39:54.834]  I remember the present, the hula hoop, the G.I.
[07:39:54.974 --> 07:39:55.495]  Joe man.
[07:39:56.255 --> 07:40:00.097]  So, I mean, I'm a living witness myself of my story.
[07:40:00.157 --> 07:40:02.978]  So, I mean- How do you know that those came from the Clintons?
[07:40:07.864 --> 07:40:18.468]  I was a kid at the time, so actually, you know, my sister, my aunts, my mom, you know, saying that, you know, they're being delivered by state cars, you know, and this and this.
[07:40:18.528 --> 07:40:22.430]  So this is, from what I, from my understanding, my parents telling me.
[07:40:23.290 --> 07:40:24.891]  But I does remember the toys.
[07:40:25.231 --> 07:40:26.232]  I does remember the money.
[07:40:26.592 --> 07:40:33.995]  I have, you know, those parents being in elementary school and people taking pictures of me and my parents had to take me out of school.
[07:40:34.515 --> 07:40:36.356]  So, I mean, what more can you?
[07:40:38.951 --> 07:40:40.613]  She told you the state cars, what kind of state cars?
[07:40:41.093 --> 07:40:43.995]  Like government state cars, Arkansas state government cars.
[07:40:45.176 --> 07:40:48.938]  You're listed in a 2007 parole report, I guess.
[07:40:48.978 --> 07:40:50.519]  Yes, I have been in trouble.
[07:40:50.559 --> 07:40:52.821]  You're having a Danny Williams Sr.
[07:40:52.861 --> 07:40:53.541]  as your father.
[07:40:53.761 --> 07:40:55.422]  Have you taken a paternity test with him?
[07:40:56.783 --> 07:40:57.304]  I don't have to.
[07:40:58.396 --> 07:41:03.418]  Concerning Dan Williams is dark, and my little sisters and brothers are dark, and I look totally different from them.
[07:41:03.798 --> 07:41:05.339]  I know he's not my father.
[07:41:05.699 --> 07:41:08.420]  He never just settled me to say, I'm not your father.
[07:41:08.760 --> 07:41:12.802]  He always told me that he can do the best he could for us, so.
[07:41:12.822 --> 07:41:15.983]  Wouldn't that just settle the issue, though, or hardly settle the issue?
[07:41:16.003 --> 07:41:23.206]  That don't settle the issue, because deep in my heart, I know, for me, growing up in a black home, and I stand out more than my siblings, I know he's not my father.
[07:41:23.226 --> 07:41:24.067]  Didn't he pass away a few months ago?
[07:41:24.927 --> 07:41:27.028]  Yes, he passed away, March.
[07:41:28.436 --> 07:41:31.998]  He died from brain aneurysm.
[07:41:32.018 --> 07:41:37.722]  What do you want from Bill Clinton other than- I want to know if he's my father.
[07:41:38.042 --> 07:41:39.243]  I want to be able to shake his hand.
[07:41:39.263 --> 07:41:40.764]  I want to be able to know him.
[07:41:40.824 --> 07:41:42.585]  I mean, I'm raising kids of my own today.
[07:41:44.406 --> 07:41:49.227]  Just to grow up and see their different personalities and through their pain, their hurt.
[07:41:52.388 --> 07:41:54.068]  No, that's what I always searched for.
[07:41:54.088 --> 07:41:57.029]  My whole life growing up without a father, you know?
[07:41:57.289 --> 07:42:00.170]  And for me to be in my kids' life and ask me, but who's your dad, you know?
[07:42:01.510 --> 07:42:03.591]  So, all I can speak of is what I know.
[07:42:04.770 --> 07:42:05.771]  And it's kind of hard.
[07:42:34.970 --> 07:42:36.633]  And the part of me that's missing.
[07:42:37.254 --> 07:42:38.255]  That's all I want to know.
[07:42:39.057 --> 07:42:41.300]  I mean, I didn't come out asking for no money.
[07:42:41.360 --> 07:42:43.103]  I came out asking for a DNA sample.
[07:42:44.545 --> 07:42:49.653]  Why did I need a DNA sample when you faked a DNA sample in 1999-2000 when she ran for Senator of the State?
[07:42:54.339 --> 07:42:55.019]  We're good to go.
[07:43:16.943 --> 07:43:27.526]  When she's come back, they got tons of money from, I don't know what the situation was, but my mama did the best she could to raise us, and just as well as her sisters, and her other sisters, so.
[07:43:27.786 --> 07:43:29.146]  Were there family photographs?
[07:43:29.166 --> 07:43:32.367]  You said they were dating, so they were dating together at the time?
[07:43:32.387 --> 07:43:35.907]  I mean, at the time, I mean, that's way before my time.
[07:43:35.988 --> 07:43:37.628]  All I know is what I've been told.
[07:43:37.648 --> 07:43:39.368]  Can you describe how you got here today?
[07:43:39.388 --> 07:43:41.969]  Did you come here from Little Rock today?
[07:43:41.989 --> 07:43:46.330]  No, I flew in yesterday, actually, and- Where'd you stay?
[07:43:47.720 --> 07:43:51.106]  I mean, as long as I'm safe, I can take whatever you're saying.
[07:43:52.308 --> 07:43:54.131]  I mean, yeah.
[07:43:56.663 --> 07:44:00.446]  And you're staying here and you're leaving after the debate?
[07:44:00.827 --> 07:44:01.808]  No, I will leave tomorrow.
[07:44:02.608 --> 07:44:05.290]  Danny, question, Adam Taxon, RSVN here.
[07:44:06.091 --> 07:44:12.136]  Besides the physical resemblance, which I think some of us are noticing here, what do people say you have in common with Bill Clinton?
[07:44:12.196 --> 07:44:13.977]  Is it a moderate amount of musical talent?
[07:44:14.478 --> 07:44:16.860]  I mean, everybody cares.
[07:44:16.940 --> 07:44:22.764]  I mean, everywhere I go, people, I mean, it's nothing for someone that's a stranger to come up and speak to me.
[07:44:23.045 --> 07:44:24.806]  Hey, Danny, hugs me, you know?
[07:44:27.521 --> 07:44:32.225]  I just feel like the charismatic, I mean, I don't, I don't, I don't too much personally.
[07:44:32.265 --> 07:44:43.794]  No, I know from growing up and just reading, you know, I've read a lot of books on Clinton and go through a lot of pictures on him and I can just see the resemblance and I can just feel it in my heart.
[07:44:44.635 --> 07:44:48.858]  So, I mean, I'm just going with what I know.
[07:44:48.878 --> 07:44:50.299]  You don't play the saxophone, do you?
[07:44:50.720 --> 07:44:51.881]  No, no saxophone.
[07:44:53.132 --> 07:44:55.053]  Are you staying at the Trump Hotel?
[07:44:55.193 --> 07:44:58.434]  No, I stayed at Treasure Island, I hope I'm safe by telling you that.
[07:44:59.675 --> 07:45:05.257]  So I hate to ask you this, but you said in your press release as well that your mother was a prostitute at the time.
[07:45:05.717 --> 07:45:06.337]  Is that correct?
[07:45:06.797 --> 07:45:07.938]  I mean, that's correct.
[07:45:08.198 --> 07:45:13.040]  At the time, I mean, she did what she had to do to make ends meet and raise us.
[07:45:13.120 --> 07:45:14.720]  At the time, I wasn't the only child.
[07:45:15.301 --> 07:45:16.741]  I had two older brothers.
[07:45:18.282 --> 07:45:21.143]  And she did what she had to do to raise us up until
[07:45:22.116 --> 07:45:22.616]  I don't know.
[07:45:22.636 --> 07:45:22.996]  I don't know.
[07:45:46.516 --> 07:45:47.938]  I mean, her story never changed, so.
[07:46:03.325 --> 07:46:05.886]  A polygraph from 93 stays the same.
[07:46:06.467 --> 07:46:11.670]  And I mean, my guys took her and got her re-polygraphed, and she's still passing.
[07:46:11.810 --> 07:46:16.272]  I mean, it still consists of 1993, which is now 2016.
[07:46:16.432 --> 07:46:25.717]  So I mean, I don't know how much more I can give to y'all to prove who I am.
[07:46:27.098 --> 07:46:30.360]  But I am Danny Wills, and I'm trying to get a sample from Bill Clinton.
[07:46:31.140 --> 07:46:32.701]  So when will the lawsuit be filed?
[07:46:33.817 --> 07:46:40.341]  We're giving him a chance to do this without having to file this lawsuit.
[07:46:42.662 --> 07:46:44.363]  I mean, as soon as we can.
[07:46:45.323 --> 07:46:50.987]  So today you're asking for the sample, and if he refuses, you will be filing litigation?
[07:46:51.187 --> 07:46:51.507]  Correct.
[07:46:51.807 --> 07:46:52.067]  Okay.
[07:46:52.187 --> 07:46:55.409]  And what kind of time frame are you proposing?
[07:46:55.509 --> 07:46:56.890]  I don't have a time frame at the moment.
[07:46:58.561 --> 07:47:03.943]  What do you think the way that he's treated you in this situation says about Bill Clinton or the Clintons generally?
[07:47:05.023 --> 07:47:06.903]  I mean, my comment I want to hold to myself.
[07:47:08.304 --> 07:47:08.484]  Why?
[07:47:08.864 --> 07:47:10.384]  I mean, it would be rude to say that.
[07:47:10.504 --> 07:47:11.725]  My comment I want to hold to myself.
[07:47:12.325 --> 07:47:14.225]  You're at a press conference that you're holding.
[07:47:14.245 --> 07:47:17.826]  What do you mean it would be rude to hold it to yourself?
[07:47:17.846 --> 07:47:19.807]  Ma'am, I didn't hear you.
[07:47:20.307 --> 07:47:24.148]  You're holding a press conference, so what do you mean it would be rude to hold your comment to yourself?
[07:47:24.168 --> 07:47:25.789]  I mean, I feel like I've been dogged all my life.
[07:47:25.809 --> 07:47:26.889]  I mean, I didn't want to just
[07:47:27.851 --> 07:47:30.532]  I feel like I shouldn't make it right.
[07:47:30.612 --> 07:47:32.552]  I feel like he should make it right.
[07:47:54.717 --> 07:47:56.958]  You're two days out of home.
[07:47:56.978 --> 07:47:57.918]  You're gone.
[07:47:57.938 --> 07:47:58.938]  You're in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[07:47:58.978 --> 07:48:00.518]  You're 25 miles, 100 miles from home.
[07:48:00.978 --> 07:48:01.318]  Correct.
[07:48:01.798 --> 07:48:04.659]  The President has got other things on his mind.
[07:48:04.679 --> 07:48:05.299]  There's a debate tonight.
[07:48:05.799 --> 07:48:06.119]  Correct.
[07:48:06.319 --> 07:48:08.219]  Do you really expect to be not disappointed?
[07:48:08.239 --> 07:48:11.140]  Do you expect some kind of answer tonight or even tomorrow?
[07:48:11.160 --> 07:48:14.681]  Do you really expect you'll get what you need tonight or tomorrow?
[07:48:14.701 --> 07:48:15.881]  I mean, that's up to him.
[07:48:17.061 --> 07:48:22.482]  Personally, me, I would expect that, but I ain't expecting it to come out tonight.
[07:48:24.428 --> 07:48:25.068]  But it's up to him.
[07:48:25.468 --> 07:48:28.989]  Well, why would you come here if you know that there's other things in this town going on?
[07:48:29.369 --> 07:48:30.670]  I come here just to try.
[07:48:31.110 --> 07:48:35.971]  And just to, you know... Because this is the only way to get people to pay attention, jeez.
[07:48:36.032 --> 07:48:40.593]  You know, this is my chance now that I get to present the story.
[07:48:41.473 --> 07:48:43.594]  And I'm not giving a chance to die.
[07:48:43.634 --> 07:48:44.814]  That's why I come here today.
[07:48:44.834 --> 07:48:47.195]  I mean, I'm gonna come to the next event.
[07:48:47.395 --> 07:48:49.856]  And if she would like to do one, I will come to her.
[07:48:49.876 --> 07:48:50.636]  I mean...
[07:48:54.491 --> 07:48:56.975]  Alright, looks like we might have lost the feed there.
[07:48:57.536 --> 07:49:00.460]  Oh, David Knight.
[07:49:00.581 --> 07:49:02.343]  I mean, I tried to reach out.
[07:49:08.712 --> 07:49:13.534]  My aunt's tribe when I was younger, and that's as far as it got.
[07:49:14.114 --> 07:49:15.455]  What was the response?
[07:49:15.555 --> 07:49:18.897]  I mean, I tried to hire a lawyer and investigators.
[07:49:18.937 --> 07:49:20.157]  They wouldn't look into my case.
[07:49:20.817 --> 07:49:22.238]  And you know, it was like a joke to them.
[07:49:22.878 --> 07:49:24.539]  Like, haha, you not be a son, you know?
[07:49:26.140 --> 07:49:27.360]  That's what the response was.
[07:49:27.380 --> 07:49:28.781]  What was the response to your aunt?
[07:49:30.507 --> 07:49:31.548]  What was your response to your aunt?
[07:49:31.668 --> 07:49:33.569]  Did she write them or what did she do?
[07:49:33.730 --> 07:49:35.191]  My aunt actually took us to the government.
[07:49:35.651 --> 07:49:41.917]  My aunt actually went to the government mansion when I was younger and to announce that he had a son.
[07:49:42.738 --> 07:49:53.448]  And from what I, my understanding that, I was a kid at the time, from my understanding that she drugged me there or what not, but from my understanding they slammed the door in her face and she was told to get off the property.
[07:49:53.568 --> 07:49:54.849]  So she took off off the property.
[07:49:56.610 --> 07:49:59.793]  Your situation is not one most of us can relate to.
[07:49:59.833 --> 07:50:07.739]  Who's been most supportive of you outside of your immediate family through your lifetime with this and your general situation?
[07:50:07.759 --> 07:50:09.320]  Like really no one.
[07:50:10.000 --> 07:50:11.201]  Like no one, I mean...
[07:50:13.994 --> 07:50:20.458]  No one been, I mean, the only support I got is since, you know, this year, since CBM running.
[07:50:21.278 --> 07:50:23.340]  Then, you know, they're pushing my story out in the media.
[07:50:23.380 --> 07:50:28.423]  So, you know, the general public, you know, the general public.
[07:50:29.406 --> 07:50:29.846]  But they're not.
[07:50:30.566 --> 07:50:31.167]  What do you mean?
[07:50:31.187 --> 07:50:34.568]  I mean, you just complained about the general public not paying attention to your stories.
[07:50:34.588 --> 07:50:37.929]  Who is they that it's been pushed... I mean, now they're sharing my posts.
[07:50:37.989 --> 07:50:39.490]  Now they're giving me, you know, good coverage.
[07:50:39.510 --> 07:50:42.771]  I wonder what angle that girl's gonna take with her stories she's about to write.
[07:50:42.791 --> 07:50:43.631]  You know, the situation I'm in.
[07:50:43.651 --> 07:50:45.692]  Now, you know... She seems very non-biased.
[07:50:45.772 --> 07:50:47.693]  All the publicity, you know, is now, you know.
[07:50:48.553 --> 07:50:51.194]  Like, I've been trying to get this out there for the longest now.
[07:50:51.315 --> 07:50:53.796]  Now all the publicity just now started coming.
[07:50:53.856 --> 07:50:55.417]  Have you tried to connect with the Trump campaign?
[07:50:55.437 --> 07:50:58.178]  Because if you're after publicity, I would think they would love to work with you.
[07:50:58.258 --> 07:50:59.859]  And now you guys, I'm just out to publicity.
[07:50:59.939 --> 07:51:01.340]  I'm out to get my story out.
[07:51:01.480 --> 07:51:04.061]  And now I never tried to connect with the Trump campaign.
[07:51:04.101 --> 07:51:05.662]  People say that I'm not trying to connect with the Trump campaign.
[07:51:05.682 --> 07:51:06.402]  The questions aren't even relevant.
[07:51:06.422 --> 07:51:06.643]  Who cares?
[07:51:06.663 --> 07:51:10.545]  It's all about to say how Trump dragged this guy out and Trump's trying to
[07:51:11.405 --> 07:51:12.726]  Put out some stunt.
[07:51:12.826 --> 07:51:16.990]  I mean, Trump support or Bernie support, or even if you support Clinton, it wouldn't change his DNA.
[07:51:17.090 --> 07:51:22.875]  When he was here and I sat down and talked with him, he said he does not want to demonize Bill Clinton.
[07:51:22.935 --> 07:51:27.198]  He didn't bring up anything about, you know, his dad's alleged past or whatever.
[07:51:27.859 --> 07:51:29.220]  All he wanted was to meet him.
[07:51:29.260 --> 07:51:30.782]  He said he's not voting.
[07:51:30.862 --> 07:51:32.083]  He knows the system's rigged.
[07:51:32.143 --> 07:51:35.365]  He knows, you know, he's not saying, oh, I'm for Trump or I'm Bill.
[07:51:35.405 --> 07:51:37.167]  He doesn't want to vote for either of them.
[07:51:37.287 --> 07:51:38.028]  I don't think so.
[07:52:01.468 --> 07:52:08.754]  What people said in Arkansas, I think there are very few of us from Arkansas who just don't know what the behind-the-scenes stuff is.
[07:52:08.834 --> 07:52:10.295]  Can you elaborate on that a little bit?
[07:52:10.315 --> 07:52:28.329]  I mean, growing up in the black community where I grew up at, everyone, all of them know, you know, everywhere I went, you know, from, from, from... ...to Las Vegas, Nevada, to present your case, when you might be a subnote on some newspaper, there was also this press conference tonight.
[07:52:28.369 --> 07:52:28.629]  Correct.
[07:52:29.049 --> 07:52:29.390]  I mean...
[07:52:34.901 --> 07:52:37.742]  Oh, the feed is really jumping here.
[07:52:56.634 --> 07:53:03.498]  But it has been out there, and it's not- You would have been of age in 2004, you would have been 18, right?
[07:53:04.219 --> 07:53:10.502]  So I guess the question is, again, why now the litigation if this is 17 years later?
[07:53:10.542 --> 07:53:14.265]  Within the time I had set back to my life, I've been raising kids since 16.
[07:53:14.885 --> 07:53:16.966]  So, like, it's been hard.
[07:53:17.967 --> 07:53:24.511]  And, you know, money situations, you know, house to house, you know, it's just been hard.
[07:53:25.832 --> 07:53:27.053]  I was working construction.
[07:53:27.333 --> 07:53:28.654]  I did work at a gas station.
[07:53:29.735 --> 07:53:36.260]  But since I've been put this out, like, you know, people don't want this part of their business.
[07:53:37.060 --> 07:53:38.041]  Right, correct.
[07:53:40.423 --> 07:53:44.106]  So lately, within the last four months, I've not been working.
[07:53:45.683 --> 07:53:46.624]  Does it pay for Vegas?
[07:53:47.405 --> 07:53:48.205]  Again, erroneous.
[07:53:48.225 --> 07:53:50.127]  Me and my friends, we funded this.
[07:53:50.287 --> 07:53:52.489]  We, you know, got together and been saving.
[07:53:53.070 --> 07:53:57.213]  Like I said, this story's been, well, I've been pushing this on the media since two years and a half.
[07:53:57.273 --> 07:54:02.698]  And I'm sure he's had people donating from his Facebook and people supporting him, trying to get a story up.
[07:54:02.798 --> 07:54:04.019]  How did you get to Vegas?
[07:54:04.119 --> 07:54:07.963]  I don't understand what's wrong with Bill Clinton's DNA that you need a new test.
[07:54:07.983 --> 07:54:09.404]  I can't tell you exactly what's wrong.
[07:54:11.687 --> 07:54:16.108]  I can elaborate on it for him.
[07:54:16.289 --> 07:54:25.732]  Monica Lewinsky case, don't quote me on this, I think in 1997 they conducted an investigation and they got the court, after the investigation they had the court transcript.
[07:54:26.452 --> 07:54:29.893]  The only DNA report they had in there was the PCR report.
[07:54:30.493 --> 07:54:38.696]  PCR test is used on DNA when it's a small amount to replicate it and enlarge it so that you can compare it to someone else's DNA.
[07:54:40.759 --> 07:54:45.521]  After you replicate and enlarge with the PCR test, you have to conduct a second test.
[07:54:46.322 --> 07:54:49.563]  And this test cuts the enzyme so that you can match it up to someone else's DNA.
[07:54:52.456 --> 07:54:54.657]  Robert Altman, uh, magazine, S.T.A.R.
[07:54:54.677 --> 07:55:02.981]  Magazine, they took this DNA test and they knew that it would not match up to Danny Williams' DNA because the enzymes haven't been cut, they haven't been took to the second step.
[07:55:03.942 --> 07:55:06.543]  And they matched it up anyway and the test results said inconclusive.
[07:55:07.383 --> 07:55:14.507]  But they did an overstatement of stating that the test proved that Bill Clinton was not his father as well as didn't disprove because it was inconclusive.
[07:55:14.827 --> 07:55:16.708]  Now the media do, they take something they're wrong with.
[07:55:18.772 --> 07:55:22.634]  Do you have a close-knit group of friends that you've had throughout most of your life?
[07:55:23.035 --> 07:55:25.316]  And is it from the black community in Little Rock, etc.?
[07:55:25.436 --> 07:55:26.897]  Do you have a buddy you grew up with?
[07:55:27.097 --> 07:55:27.417]  Correct.
[07:55:27.858 --> 07:55:28.078]  Okay.
[07:55:28.558 --> 07:55:29.058]  Same guys.
[07:55:29.719 --> 07:55:29.939]  I know.
[07:55:29.959 --> 07:55:30.860]  I was just thinking that.
[07:55:31.160 --> 07:55:34.302]  He looks just like Bill Clinton.
[07:55:34.482 --> 07:55:37.784]  And having met him, you know... I was sitting next to him.
[07:55:37.844 --> 07:55:39.465]  It was like, whoa.
[07:55:39.545 --> 07:55:40.205]  It's weird.
[07:55:40.225 --> 07:55:41.506]  I was sitting next to Bill Clinton.
[07:55:41.806 --> 07:55:42.147]  It was weird.
[07:55:42.167 --> 07:55:42.227]  Wow.
[07:55:42.267 --> 07:55:45.669]  He was constantly taking pictures of me outside on the playground or whatnot.
[07:55:46.880 --> 07:55:50.881]  And my aunt felt for my safety, so she took me out of the school and relocated me.
[07:55:50.901 --> 07:55:54.082]  But you have to care for your safety now, given away that hotel information.
[07:55:54.422 --> 07:55:55.822]  To keep me safe.
[07:55:57.063 --> 07:55:58.143]  And you're how old are you?
[07:55:59.043 --> 07:55:59.183]  I'm 30.
[07:55:59.223 --> 07:56:03.424]  Did you play any sports growing up or have any particular hobbies?
[07:56:03.564 --> 07:56:07.045]  I played football in junior high, but like I said, I had to coach.
[07:56:07.545 --> 07:56:10.426]  Not only I had to raise my kids, I had a kid at 16.
[07:56:10.606 --> 07:56:12.987]  I was looking out for my little sisters and brothers.
[07:56:14.545 --> 07:56:19.788]  I'm on one there all the time, so I had to make sure that was okay too.
[07:56:19.868 --> 07:56:22.509]  I'm not questioning you, I'm just trying to find out more about you, that's all.
[07:56:22.910 --> 07:56:25.911]  Yeah, by 11th grade I dropped out of school to work full time.
[07:56:26.372 --> 07:56:28.793]  My first job was at a donut shop, so.
[07:56:35.737 --> 07:56:37.358]  Will you be on the show tonight?
[07:56:37.378 --> 07:56:37.618]  No, I won't.
[07:56:38.777 --> 07:56:39.538]  Will you be watching?
[07:56:39.959 --> 07:56:40.500]  Yes I will.
[07:56:40.780 --> 07:56:41.141]  From where?
[07:56:41.822 --> 07:56:44.766]  I guess the TV inside the Treasure Island.
[07:56:44.826 --> 07:56:45.207]  Thank you.
[07:56:45.327 --> 07:56:46.128]  I thank y'all.
[07:56:47.490 --> 07:56:47.891]  Thank you.
[07:56:48.151 --> 07:56:48.472]  Thank you.
[07:56:52.282 --> 07:56:54.523]  All right, well, there was Danny Williams.
[07:56:54.563 --> 07:56:56.824]  I don't know about you, but that was a little intense.
[07:56:56.864 --> 07:57:00.066]  But you can see the media is just like sharks.
[07:57:00.186 --> 07:57:03.608]  You can already tell the one girl's building this.
[07:57:03.928 --> 07:57:07.570]  The reason why I just was so triggered by the girl from the Daily Beast.
[07:57:07.910 --> 07:57:11.232]  She actually was saying the exact same thing with Sean Hannity last night.
[07:57:11.272 --> 07:57:18.435]  If you look at Sean Hannity's Twitter, they kind of got into a little bit of a Twitter battle because she was saying, I tried to get in touch with Juanita Broderick.
[07:57:18.455 --> 07:57:19.336]  How dare you say the main...
[07:57:21.155 --> 07:57:21.295]  Yeah.
[07:57:36.135 --> 07:57:36.575]  I think so.
[07:57:55.916 --> 07:57:56.316]  I think so.
[07:58:13.686 --> 07:58:16.788]  Twenty years ago, on the radio, he looks just like Bill Clinton.
[07:58:16.808 --> 07:58:19.769]  The newspaper admits it did this fake DNA test.
[07:58:20.309 --> 07:58:25.071]  And you could see how genuine he was and the poise he has, despite the fact that he grew up in foster homes.
[07:58:25.732 --> 07:58:27.333]  And it's just amazing.
[07:58:27.353 --> 07:58:29.634]  I mean, the guy looks like he could be a movie star or something in that suit.
[07:58:29.914 --> 07:58:31.194]  He's obviously Bill Clinton's son.
[07:58:31.655 --> 07:58:33.215]  And we know Bill Clinton's whole past.
[07:58:33.576 --> 07:58:37.117]  And these people are sitting here trying to absolutely defend this lie.
[07:58:37.137 --> 07:58:40.119]  And you see these little mean reporters, so cynical.
[07:58:41.059 --> 07:58:48.863]  Trying to attack this guy, it was so incredibly painful to watch, and obviously in one hour, the big debate kicks off.
[07:58:49.223 --> 07:58:51.905]  You'll be with us, Margaret, and of course Leigh-Anne and everybody else.
[07:58:52.225 --> 07:58:57.568]  We'll have the hour and a half final debate and coverage afterwards, but this is such an amazing time.
[07:58:57.608 --> 07:58:59.369]  At first tonight, about an hour ago,
[07:59:00.754 --> 07:59:02.314]  I knew we were going to be carrying the right side feed.
[07:59:02.354 --> 07:59:03.955]  They had told us that this thing was coming up.
[07:59:03.975 --> 07:59:04.955]  That's how I learned about it today.
[07:59:04.975 --> 07:59:06.656]  You know, it's all so rigged.
[07:59:06.716 --> 07:59:09.496]  I learned about it from right side, like, you know, during the show today.
[07:59:10.036 --> 07:59:12.097]  The owner of right side said, hey, they're going to have this press conference.
[07:59:12.337 --> 07:59:13.297]  Nobody knows this yet.
[07:59:13.357 --> 07:59:14.318]  Bring it here on your show.
[07:59:14.338 --> 07:59:15.598]  He said they're going to have a press conference.
[07:59:15.618 --> 07:59:16.318]  He said, let me talk to you off air.
[07:59:16.338 --> 07:59:19.999]  And it was, it was Danny Williams and also Malik Obama, the brother of Obama.
[07:59:20.299 --> 07:59:21.520]  That was going to be the press conference.
[07:59:21.860 --> 07:59:22.740]  They had another room.
[07:59:23.320 --> 07:59:31.288]  The CNN reportedly showed up, threatened, because they had all these executive rooms set up, because it's at the Conference Center Hotel where the debate's happening, threatened everybody.
[07:59:31.328 --> 07:59:32.469]  So that got cancelled.
[07:59:32.889 --> 07:59:35.792]  Somehow they scrambled, because the front desk didn't know.
[07:59:35.812 --> 07:59:37.013]  It was all, you know, lies.
[07:59:37.034 --> 07:59:40.237]  Went and got another room and had this, but then Malik Obama wasn't there.
[07:59:40.497 --> 07:59:42.018]  The brother was what they were scared of.
[07:59:42.078 --> 07:59:42.879]  He was going to release.
[07:59:43.079 --> 07:59:44.421]  This is the admitted half-brother of Obama.
[07:59:44.841 --> 07:59:50.726]  He was going to release Bombshell, and this is what I was being told at like, I don't know, 12.30, 1 o'clock today, by Right Side.
[07:59:50.766 --> 07:59:53.588]  They just learned about it yesterday from Danny Williams.
[07:59:53.628 --> 07:59:57.190]  And listen, Danny Williams was contacting me, like he said, two and a half years ago.
[07:59:57.531 --> 07:59:58.572]  He was contacting Biggs.
[07:59:58.672 --> 07:59:59.572]  That's why he loves Biggs.
[07:59:59.592 --> 08:00:00.353]  He's got Biggs all over.
[08:00:00.693 --> 08:00:03.215]  We're just like, yeah, I remember Danny Williams, but nobody's going to care.
[08:00:03.255 --> 08:00:04.256]  Yeah, it's probably his son.
[08:00:04.576 --> 08:00:08.939]  But the media acts like it's this big, you know, that's how they do stuff, is scripts from the White House.
[08:00:08.999 --> 08:00:13.083]  And WikiLeaks has the documents that they get orders from her on what to do and what to say.
[08:00:13.743 --> 08:00:15.744]  Leanne, does somebody tell you what to do with your reports around here?
[08:00:15.764 --> 08:00:17.584]  I mean, we are seat of our pants.
[08:00:17.624 --> 08:00:18.004]  Margaret?
[08:00:18.304 --> 08:00:20.005]  No, absolutely not.
[08:00:20.025 --> 08:00:22.926]  Sometimes I'd like to be yanked by the arm and then do this, do that.
[08:00:22.946 --> 08:00:24.366]  No, me too, me too, me too.
[08:00:24.406 --> 08:00:27.147]  I mean, I've got David calling me, you know, 20 minutes, he goes, I'm here.
[08:00:27.547 --> 08:00:28.507]  They've canceled it.
[08:00:28.527 --> 08:00:29.568]  There's a bunch of media here.
[08:00:29.628 --> 08:00:30.628]  Most of the media left.
[08:00:31.248 --> 08:00:32.809]  Then we end up getting this conference room.
[08:00:32.849 --> 08:00:33.249]  They do.
[08:00:33.609 --> 08:00:39.691]  And it's just, it's so insulting to have them look at us and say, we're all calculating and everything, which I wish we were.
[08:00:41.235 --> 08:00:44.700]  And then, no, they're totally calculating, as you were saying, Leigh-Anne and Margaret, the scripting.
[08:00:44.941 --> 08:00:52.592]  What they said on Sean Hannity last night, what they said today, when these women are on there, just saying, you know, dehumanizing this guy instead of giving him the DNA tests.
[08:00:52.984 --> 08:00:58.566]  But then acting like they're high and mighty and they're the ones that are for the poor and the downtrodden and for the victims.
[08:00:58.626 --> 08:01:01.146]  And they steal 94% of the Haitian money.
[08:01:01.547 --> 08:01:03.747]  Yeah, I mean it's just totally hypocritical.
[08:01:03.867 --> 08:01:12.890]  And then you see that reporter there is a perfect example of the kind of bought and paid for media that her job is to go out and spin everything.
[08:01:13.190 --> 08:01:17.371]  And so you can just... Oh, they just turned the whole thing into... Venomous voice!
[08:01:17.411 --> 08:01:22.193]  She's like... But the thing is, Danny, because I spent hours with him at lunch and after before he flew out last week,
[08:01:23.486 --> 08:01:26.407]  But, I mean, when you're with him, you can tell this guy is like a janitor.
[08:01:26.747 --> 08:01:29.168]  He's a smart guy, but he's got three kids with the same woman.
[08:01:29.188 --> 08:01:29.788]  Five kids.
[08:01:29.989 --> 08:01:31.309]  Five kids, excuse me.
[08:01:31.429 --> 08:01:33.970]  And all this is going on, and he wasn't even getting stuff I was saying.
[08:01:34.190 --> 08:01:35.250]  Like, was he attacking him?
[08:01:35.671 --> 08:01:36.451]  Like, who's running this?
[08:01:36.471 --> 08:01:36.911]  Who pays him?
[08:01:36.931 --> 08:01:41.913]  He goes, I'm on the Facebook, and I tried to get attention, but now it's getting it because of the campaign.
[08:01:42.333 --> 08:01:46.175]  Obviously, in fact, I remember thinking about trying to get Danny on.
[08:01:46.455 --> 08:01:49.916]  It never happened, and then all of a sudden it's in the Daily Mail because of his Facebook.
[08:01:50.336 --> 08:01:50.556]  Right.
[08:01:50.656 --> 08:01:53.098]  You know, I mean, again, they changed the subject.
[08:01:53.278 --> 08:01:55.000]  We know who's being coordinated.
[08:01:55.060 --> 08:01:58.202]  It's CNN, it's MSNBC, it's CNBC, it's ABC.
[08:01:58.522 --> 08:01:59.303]  It's all in there.
[08:01:59.343 --> 08:02:01.144]  They're coordinating everything they do with Hillary.
[08:02:01.364 --> 08:02:03.646]  They talk about the new emails, cover-up for health issues.
[08:02:04.446 --> 08:02:06.488]  They talk about shadow government, don't worry.
[08:02:06.508 --> 08:02:08.770]  You know, we're going to bribe the FBI agents.
[08:02:08.850 --> 08:02:13.933]  I mean, this is mega bombshell after mega bombshell, which quite frankly makes me sad for this country.
[08:02:14.234 --> 08:02:15.675]  The fact that the mainstream media
[08:02:16.781 --> 08:02:21.266]  is so lockstep that they would absolutely sign on to all this criminality.
[08:02:21.687 --> 08:02:23.849]  They are clearly getting ready to try to steal this election.
[08:02:23.890 --> 08:02:27.374]  And again, even if they do, they lose because the public is waking up to them.
[08:02:27.972 --> 08:02:51.309]  Absolutely, and that's what I keep telling everyone out there that's watching this, is that no matter what happens on election day, we all have to be really thankful and proud that we are all awake and that we have not fallen victim to the huge, massive PSYOP campaign that is going on, and what a time to be alive to see it all being exposed at such a deep level, and my gosh, Alex, did you ever think you'd be name-dropped
[08:02:51.929 --> 08:02:52.830]  In this whole thing.
[08:02:52.870 --> 08:02:54.511]  I mean, talk about being on the front line.
[08:02:54.571 --> 08:02:56.773]  Your dark heart, Alex.
[08:02:56.813 --> 08:03:00.656]  Your black, black heart, you know, just had to come out in national media.
[08:03:00.696 --> 08:03:02.578]  We've been laughing about that for 15 minutes.
[08:03:03.038 --> 08:03:15.208]  I just, I really, I don't want to, I don't want to end this without talking about Danny Williams just one more time or just mentioning him again because his humanity, Leigh-Anne, looking at Leigh-Anne's face, we tear up when we hear this guy talk because you can hear his heart and soul.
[08:03:15.529 --> 08:03:16.129]  This is not a curse.
[08:03:16.149 --> 08:03:17.050]  He says, I don't want to fight Mike.
[08:03:17.070 --> 08:03:17.911]  He don't want to fight Bill.
[08:03:18.091 --> 08:03:18.831]  He doesn't want to demonize.
[08:03:18.851 --> 08:03:20.092]  He wouldn't mad mouth him when I was here.
[08:03:20.152 --> 08:03:20.553]  Or Hillary.
[08:03:21.073 --> 08:03:22.875]  He just said, I want to meet my dad.
[08:03:23.095 --> 08:03:24.316]  It was not political.
[08:03:24.577 --> 08:03:27.159]  And that's the thing is, we need to show people that video.
[08:03:27.199 --> 08:03:28.881]  It's not political at all for him.
[08:03:28.961 --> 08:03:30.642]  He said, I'm not even voting.
[08:03:31.443 --> 08:03:32.945]  He doesn't feel as if his vote counts.
[08:03:33.005 --> 08:03:34.626]  He's not voting for Clinton or Trump.
[08:03:35.027 --> 08:03:36.328]  He doesn't like either choice.
[08:03:36.428 --> 08:03:37.389]  It wasn't political.
[08:03:37.489 --> 08:03:40.212]  He didn't even talk about the stories about his father.
[08:03:40.232 --> 08:03:42.574]  You know, he just wants to meet his dad.
[08:03:42.714 --> 08:03:48.798]  Well, I mean, it's one more example of total government control when it comes to mainstream media and why mainstream media is dying.
[08:03:48.878 --> 08:03:51.060]  Leigh Ann and Margaret will be checking in with both of you.
[08:03:51.180 --> 08:03:53.041]  And hey, Alex, if I could jump in here real quick.
[08:03:53.821 --> 08:03:54.722]  This thing went viral.
[08:03:55.082 --> 08:03:59.125]  275,000 views in just 10 minutes, whatever this is on right now.
[08:03:59.145 --> 08:04:00.286]  This is Rob Dew in the control room.
[08:04:01.087 --> 08:04:03.069]  Scroll, pull up that article guys real quick.
[08:04:03.089 --> 08:04:04.090]  That's just our Facebook mentions.
[08:04:04.110 --> 08:04:05.211]  That's just our Facebook mentions.
[08:04:05.231 --> 08:04:06.253]  That's not even the right side of the feed.
[08:04:06.273 --> 08:04:07.955]  So people are craving this information.
[08:04:07.995 --> 08:04:09.677]  People are interested in what's going on.
[08:04:09.817 --> 08:04:15.784]  Oh listen, when CNN brings it up, when a guest does, they cut the feed or cut the satellite.
[08:04:16.304 --> 08:04:23.287]  We're seeing unprecedented, so we have millions of people on our mainstreams tuning in, little side streams, a quarter million over 15 minutes.
[08:04:23.588 --> 08:04:29.811]  That's an example exactly of why the mainstream media is totally falling apart because they will not let you see this information.
[08:04:30.091 --> 08:04:32.432]  They lied to you about Hillary and the foundation.
[08:04:32.712 --> 08:04:34.393]  They lied to you about Hillary and the Saudis.
[08:04:34.653 --> 08:04:39.315]  They lied to you about Hillary and ISIS and Fast and Furious and targeting Christian groups with the IRS.
[08:04:39.615 --> 08:04:40.796]  They lied to you about Hillary.
[08:04:41.636 --> 08:04:43.037]  Trying to bribe the FBI.
[08:04:43.097 --> 08:04:45.859]  That is in the FBI data dump of yesterday.
[08:04:46.419 --> 08:04:48.301]  That's not in WikiLeaks, which is undisputed.
[08:04:48.521 --> 08:04:51.483]  This is the FBI with memos of how they tried to bribe them.
[08:04:51.643 --> 08:04:56.927]  And I covered one of the guys earlier, Patrick Kennedy, who was one of the lead cover-up artists for the underwear bomber.
[08:04:57.881 --> 08:05:05.123]  He's one of the guys who was sitting there covering it up, saying, oh, we let the guy on the plane because we were thinking he was working with other people.
[08:05:05.184 --> 08:05:05.944]  Total BS!
[08:05:06.284 --> 08:05:12.226]  Now they were ordered to let the underwear bomber on so they could pass the regulations to put the naked body scanners in, absolutely.
[08:05:12.506 --> 08:05:14.227]  Alright, Rob, keep collating information.
[08:05:14.247 --> 08:05:18.968]  I'm going to run a tape here in a moment of some breaking news we've got so we can kind of collate more of this for the viewers.
[08:05:19.008 --> 08:05:20.709]  There's also going to be another press conference
[08:05:21.229 --> 08:05:28.214]  With surprise info, we were told about live on the air today, with Trump and other people after the debate tonight.
[08:05:28.254 --> 08:05:29.635]  So a lot is happening here.
[08:05:29.976 --> 08:05:31.877]  We've got our own feeds on the ground in Vegas.
[08:05:32.337 --> 08:05:35.540]  We've got backup feeds, because you saw right side, they were cutting out, we were cutting out.
[08:05:35.580 --> 08:05:40.524]  But because we had two feeds, we were able to balance it out and have our two feeds come together and basically give you complete coverage.
[08:05:41.408 --> 08:05:45.109]  But understand there were, I talked to our crew, there were more than 30 TV cameras.
[08:05:45.609 --> 08:05:49.230]  That press conference started 30 minutes late and in another room and that's how they worked it.
[08:05:49.270 --> 08:05:51.671]  Oh, it's canceled to run everybody off.
[08:05:52.691 --> 08:06:08.396]  And then they had their only, you know, few Newsweek, Daily Beast, establishment hacks there who were so cynical and on such power trips when all they're doing is perching on top a sinking establishment media that's almost sunk beneath the waves.
[08:06:09.963 --> 08:06:11.844]  We have several extremely powerful clips.
[08:06:12.824 --> 08:06:27.371]  And one of the biggest crimes of the Clintons is that they've some numbers of 3.8 billion, but they became the number one net to suck up all the donations after that earthquake in Haiti, what was it, five years ago.
[08:06:27.992 --> 08:06:29.152]  They raised over $2 billion.
[08:06:29.412 --> 08:06:32.053]  Even the Washington Post said they made a mistake and kept 94%.
[08:06:33.891 --> 08:06:40.554]  Ladies and gentlemen, if they had kept half of it, it would have been a major, giant scandal.
[08:06:40.955 --> 08:06:41.775]  But they kept that.
[08:06:41.875 --> 08:06:42.816]  Anybody can search that.
[08:06:42.856 --> 08:06:43.616]  That's admitted.
[08:06:44.216 --> 08:06:47.018]  And now they're raising money again off of what's happening in Haiti.
[08:06:47.858 --> 08:06:54.121]  So I have a very special report with a gentleman that's still in Haiti right now, Gary Haven, that I want to air.
[08:06:54.262 --> 08:06:54.882]  Special report.
[08:06:54.942 --> 08:06:58.304]  Clinton's preying on Haitian disaster victims by pocketing millions.
[08:06:59.344 --> 08:07:00.425]  They're doing it again.
[08:07:00.485 --> 08:07:03.967]  I mean, the headline is, we should add, the Clintons are robbing Haiti again.
[08:07:03.987 --> 08:07:04.908]  We should change that headline.
[08:07:05.108 --> 08:07:12.693]  Cruz, great, but I'm telling you, the Clintons are crapping on the Haitians and robbing and stealing 90 plus percent of the donations.
[08:07:13.534 --> 08:07:18.397]  And by the way, they didn't just keep 94 plus percent, 94.3 percent of the money they raised.
[08:07:18.477 --> 08:07:20.599]  They got over 90 percent of the donations.
[08:07:20.879 --> 08:07:24.422]  In the first six months, the media said, you know, the media is in love with the Clintons.
[08:07:24.682 --> 08:07:25.703]  Give it to them.
[08:07:26.043 --> 08:07:27.504]  They'll make sure it gets to Haiti.
[08:07:28.646 --> 08:07:33.489]  So they didn't just only give less than 6% to them, they got 90%.
[08:07:34.250 --> 08:07:37.692]  They got everybody's money that would have gone there to them.
[08:07:39.653 --> 08:07:41.294]  And they were with the Bushes the first few months.
[08:07:41.314 --> 08:07:46.878]  The Bushes were so horrible, they kept half of it, but then they broke up with the Bushes, because I guess the Bushes wanted to at least give half the money to them.
[08:07:47.819 --> 08:07:49.140]  I mean, this is incredible.
[08:07:49.180 --> 08:07:50.260]  And I'm not defending the Bushes.
[08:07:50.340 --> 08:07:52.182]  I'm just giving you the facts of what's going on here.
[08:07:53.288 --> 08:07:53.408]  Yes.
[08:08:12.489 --> 08:08:15.691]  Listen to people telling his daughter and others that Hillary's going to play nice, just be nice.
[08:08:15.731 --> 08:08:18.974]  He took the high road, called her Mrs. Secretary, she stabbed him in the back first debate.
[08:08:19.354 --> 08:08:32.404]  He went with his own common sense, destroyed her in the last one, and Nigel Farage says that he's going to destroy, Trump will destroy Hillary in the final debate, that this will be the coup de grace, the absolute devastating strike.
[08:08:33.044 --> 08:08:34.446]  So that's up on Infowars.com.
[08:08:34.466 --> 08:08:36.449]  Nigel Farage, Trump destroy Hillary in final debate.
[08:08:36.730 --> 08:08:39.113]  Trump will deliver the knockout blow to Hillary Clinton tonight.
[08:08:39.494 --> 08:08:41.076]  And we are now 52 minutes out.
[08:08:41.116 --> 08:08:43.459]  So I want to air first the Haitian report.
[08:08:43.900 --> 08:08:46.524]  We also mention a real charity where Haven's done his research.
[08:08:46.544 --> 08:08:47.685]  He isn't collecting the money he's given.
[08:08:48.973 --> 08:08:50.534]  Some like 80 million of his own money.
[08:08:50.794 --> 08:08:53.016]  As he gets there over the last five years, he can't quit doing it.
[08:08:53.416 --> 08:08:54.817]  When he shows up, y'all just love him.
[08:08:55.938 --> 08:08:57.999]  Every few days, four of his aircraft are landing.
[08:08:58.339 --> 08:09:01.902]  Many times him coming in on super dangerous dirt runways.
[08:09:02.302 --> 08:09:07.605]  After the hurricane of just two days ago, another relief plane with private Americans there helping the folks crashed.
[08:09:07.665 --> 08:09:09.747]  All four on board died in a cargo plane.
[08:09:10.708 --> 08:09:13.009]  Haven was out trying to find them and then they were found dead.
[08:09:13.029 --> 08:09:15.751]  So this is a very serious situation.
[08:09:16.391 --> 08:09:18.513]  And again, we're here to tip the spear.
[08:09:19.093 --> 08:09:23.374]  I'm not bragging about this, but I sent two reporters and I paid for some of the gas and put a little money in.
[08:09:23.394 --> 08:09:26.795]  We don't have that much, but I mean, it feels good to try to help the Haitians.
[08:09:26.835 --> 08:09:31.936]  Especially, well, you know, the Clintons are pieces of filth that frickin' stole two billion dollars.
[08:09:31.956 --> 08:09:33.377]  You could rebuild that whole island for that.
[08:09:34.497 --> 08:09:36.878]  And it's just, imagine if we get in trouble.
[08:09:36.938 --> 08:09:37.978]  Imagine if we need help.
[08:09:38.698 --> 08:09:39.978]  You know, I want America to be good.
[08:09:39.998 --> 08:09:41.299]  I want us to be a proud nation again.
[08:09:43.266 --> 08:09:58.755]  at the heads of the major Democratic Party get out the vote group that James O'Keefe is on the show tomorrow, Project Veritas got on video, what an amazing organization, the model of true investigative journalism, and it's all just unedited, hours of video up on InfoWars.com.
[08:10:00.476 --> 08:10:02.658]  And it's so incredible when you watch this, you've got
[08:10:05.404 --> 08:10:09.986]  The head of the Democratic Party, Vote Operation Nationwide, and the deputy head saying, we don't care.
[08:10:10.326 --> 08:10:12.887]  We have people on buses going around voting 10 times a day.
[08:10:12.907 --> 08:10:14.088]  That matter, it's illegal.
[08:10:14.128 --> 08:10:15.188]  We control the police and the courts.
[08:10:15.709 --> 08:10:16.669]  We can do whatever we want.
[08:10:16.709 --> 08:10:17.789]  We're taking over America.
[08:10:17.809 --> 08:10:19.590]  We're taking over the states, the legislatures.
[08:10:19.810 --> 08:10:22.791]  You can now take this video and go to your legislature and say, voter ID.
[08:10:23.312 --> 08:10:24.272]  We have them all on tape.
[08:10:24.512 --> 08:10:25.553]  But it wasn't like it's a secret.
[08:10:25.753 --> 08:10:29.434]  Democrats in seven, eight states are trying to get laws passed for illegals to vote.
[08:10:30.315 --> 08:10:31.695]  Can I go to Mexico or China and vote?
[08:10:31.975 --> 08:10:32.836]  Can't vote in China anyways.
[08:10:33.076 --> 08:10:33.476]  Hell no!
[08:10:34.687 --> 08:10:35.490]  I mean, that's not right.
[08:10:35.510 --> 08:10:37.155]  It's like, well, why do you hate Mexicans or whoever?
[08:10:37.395 --> 08:10:38.198]  I don't hate Mexicans!
[08:10:38.258 --> 08:10:39.281]  I can't go to Mexico and vote!
[08:10:42.708 --> 08:10:44.308]  So, you know, this is what they do.
[08:10:44.528 --> 08:10:52.670]  This is the arrogance of these monsters that get up on C-SPAN like Gruber and say, thank God you're dumb because Obamacare was written by foreign banks to rape your ass.
[08:10:53.310 --> 08:10:58.171]  I mean, you know, at a certain point, as a real liberal, I don't care what your sexual preference is.
[08:10:58.231 --> 08:10:59.111]  I'm not on your ass.
[08:10:59.191 --> 08:11:00.471]  I'm a Libertine.
[08:11:00.792 --> 08:11:01.532]  Everybody knows that.
[08:11:01.952 --> 08:11:05.132]  And man, I get called a racist, a homophobe, an Islamophobe.
[08:11:05.192 --> 08:11:05.852]  I'll be honest with you.
[08:11:06.173 --> 08:11:07.933]  Mainline Islam has become radicalized.
[08:11:08.533 --> 08:11:15.174]  They're chopping women's genitals off, enslaving them, putting markers on them, invading all these countries, raping eight-year-old girls en masse, cutting priest heads off.
[08:11:15.594 --> 08:11:16.115]  You know what?
[08:11:16.335 --> 08:11:17.355]  I am Islamophobic.
[08:11:17.395 --> 08:11:18.335]  I'm Nazi-phobic.
[08:11:18.635 --> 08:11:20.095]  I'm tyranny-phobic.
[08:11:20.395 --> 08:11:21.296]  I'm communist-phobic.
[08:11:21.836 --> 08:11:22.596]  I'm an American.
[08:11:23.996 --> 08:11:25.717]  I got two daughters and a son.
[08:11:27.197 --> 08:11:35.739]  And I watch these feminists set up and not say a word about Islam, all its abuses, and then wag their finger at me that I should accept their taxes and their agenda, or I don't like women.
[08:11:35.959 --> 08:11:37.319]  I tell you, you go straight to hell.
[08:11:38.973 --> 08:11:39.775]  You go straight to hell.
[08:11:39.815 --> 08:11:41.518]  Men and women have an incredible relationship together.
[08:11:41.558 --> 08:11:42.280]  We're the species.
[08:11:43.482 --> 08:11:45.223]  And if I do anything, I spoil the living hell out of women.
[08:11:46.064 --> 08:11:54.290]  And feminists just want to get women away from families and men so the state can be the daddy, so they can pimp you out and ruin your life, and women are more unhappy than they've ever been.
[08:11:54.810 --> 08:12:04.677]  Society's falling apart, our families are falling apart, and they want to make the entire country and the world, just like what they've done to the black community, going from lower illegitimacy rate than any other racial group to the highest illegitimacy rate.
[08:12:04.878 --> 08:12:06.299]  They want to F you and your family.
[08:12:06.499 --> 08:12:07.459]  You get that straight to your head.
[08:12:07.960 --> 08:12:12.143]  But hey, let me tell you something, CNN and others, you didn't stop crap tonight trying to shut down that press conference.
[08:12:13.442 --> 08:12:20.792]  And we've got, last time I checked before we went live, a million and a half people watching on three different streams we've got.
[08:12:22.657 --> 08:12:23.977]  So that's what's going down right now.
[08:12:23.997 --> 08:12:35.882]  And I think we should just come set a tripod up right in here in front of everything, or maybe in a quiet room with a computer on, maybe in Anthony's office with our feed, and have a Facebook mentions aimed right at it with the audio cranked up.
[08:12:36.322 --> 08:12:38.062]  I bet that ends up getting 2 million views as well.
[08:12:38.382 --> 08:12:39.823]  CNN would kill for 2 million views.
[08:12:40.083 --> 08:12:40.863]  They're a joke!
[08:12:41.243 --> 08:12:42.904]  People know we're teleprompter free.
[08:12:43.144 --> 08:12:44.164]  They know we're for real.
[08:12:44.244 --> 08:12:44.745]  They know.
[08:12:46.185 --> 08:12:46.825]  We're taking action.
[08:12:46.845 --> 08:12:48.546]  So I'm going to give you analysis on this key debate.
[08:12:48.826 --> 08:12:50.167]  Our reporters are on the ground in Las Vegas.
[08:12:50.187 --> 08:12:51.167]  They'll be popping in as well.
[08:12:53.083 --> 08:12:56.465]  Let's go ahead and go to this incredible Haiti report that the Clintons do not want you to see.
[08:12:57.065 --> 08:13:02.207]  And then Nigel Farage, the guy that helped lead the UK out of the EU, which they never voted to enter.
[08:13:02.808 --> 08:13:03.468]  That's the whole point.
[08:13:03.888 --> 08:13:04.789]  Just like TPP.
[08:13:05.349 --> 08:13:08.290]  And then we will come back and break so much more down on Alex Jones.
[08:13:08.350 --> 08:13:12.552]  Please don't forget, it costs a lot of money to have reporters travel in the world.
[08:13:12.912 --> 08:13:16.094]  It costs a lot of money to have this big crew and then these great people behind the scenes.
[08:13:16.114 --> 08:13:17.514]  We don't even have a second string.
[08:13:17.875 --> 08:13:20.236]  When we go 20 hours a day like we're doing today,
[08:13:21.603 --> 08:13:24.304]  13 hours of live broadcasts, many hours of preparation.
[08:13:24.684 --> 08:13:25.584]  It's probably a 24-hour day.
[08:13:26.184 --> 08:13:27.004]  We don't have a second string.
[08:13:27.584 --> 08:13:31.265]  We need to hire maybe 10, 15 people, bare minimum like 10.
[08:13:31.805 --> 08:13:36.046]  More editors, more switchers, more producers, more video editors, investigative journalists.

[08:14:16.565 --> 08:14:17.065]  I don't know.
[08:14:39.198 --> 08:14:39.619]  We're good to go.
[08:14:58.450 --> 08:15:04.033]  Right now, with the crew, because we've got a lot coming up, a lot of developments happening fast in this war.
[08:15:04.053 --> 08:15:05.774]  A very exciting time to be alive.
[08:15:06.054 --> 08:15:08.995]  We're 19 days out, it'll be 18 in just about 3 hours central.
[08:15:09.496 --> 08:15:12.957]  We are 5 hours central, 4 hours eastern.
[08:15:13.398 --> 08:15:16.579]  We are here, and it's really 18 days out.
[08:15:16.879 --> 08:15:19.481]  We're 45 minutes out from the beginning of this historic debate.
[08:15:20.261 --> 08:15:23.263]  Look for Wallace to play all sorts of underhanded tactics against
[08:15:23.843 --> 08:15:34.689]  Trump microphones have been turned off 15 times, not 15 times, if you're interrupted 62 times by one and you're interrupted 46 times by another.
[08:15:34.709 --> 08:15:37.191]  Hillary's was interrupted three times and six times.
[08:15:37.851 --> 08:15:40.072]  Let's see what's what's six out of 40.
[08:15:40.112 --> 08:15:40.392]  I guess
[08:15:42.901 --> 08:15:44.101]  Six, seven times, yeah.
[08:15:44.181 --> 08:15:46.542]  They interrupt six, seven times more Trump than they do anybody else.
[08:15:46.982 --> 08:15:48.242]  They're throwing everything they got at him.
[08:15:48.782 --> 08:15:53.663]  And it's because they know he's a nationalist and they know he was recruited by patriots in America to try to save this nation.
[08:15:53.683 --> 08:15:55.684]  Because they plan to fully bankrupt us and get control of us.
[08:15:56.184 --> 08:15:56.784]  So that's coming up.
[08:15:56.824 --> 08:16:05.026]  And one more activist thing you can do while they try to shut down these feeds and while CNN reportedly showed up and tried to shut things down and tried to shut down the press conference to confuse people.
[08:16:05.956 --> 08:16:10.099]  In the fog of war, you can take the link at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[08:16:10.119 --> 08:16:12.520]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[08:16:12.540 --> 08:16:23.208]  And you can take that feed, and you can send that to your Facebook, your Twitter, you name it, and say, here's the censored behind-the-scenes feed at the final Trump rally, the final showdown.
[08:16:24.025 --> 08:16:34.668]  Now, there's some little backup thing we're not really doing, but if you go to our servers or Facebook, we've got hundreds of thousands of millions that are watching, but you can also send out the YouTube feed that I guess nobody's really dialed into right now.
[08:16:34.948 --> 08:16:40.209]  We're going to send all that out in another email at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[08:16:40.729 --> 08:16:44.410]  We'll send that link out there, but find our feed, the other feeds, backup feeds.
[08:16:44.851 --> 08:16:49.772]  It's all at InfoWars.com forward slash show right now.
[08:16:50.632 --> 08:17:05.161]  And, uh, we're gonna, since everybody wants a Facebook mention, we were on like 20 minutes of the press conference, that had a quarter million folks tuned in, we will, uh, why don't you go in Anthony's office, that's probably a quiet place, turn it on, get it turned up nice, set it up on a tripod, and then just give him a Facebook mentions right there.
[08:17:06.161 --> 08:17:08.023]  Because that's, that's how we get this job done.
[08:17:09.203 --> 08:17:10.944]  Oh, I'm sorry, I said quarter million.
[08:17:10.964 --> 08:17:12.805]  369,000 views on the Facebook mentions we did.
[08:17:17.825 --> 08:17:18.406]  47 minutes ago.
[08:17:18.426 --> 08:17:19.126]  That's what I'm talking about.
[08:17:19.447 --> 08:17:21.408]  Our internal feed is over a million on our feed.
[08:17:22.229 --> 08:17:23.871]  And I guess YouTube has to restart.
[08:17:23.911 --> 08:17:25.472]  That's why it was like half a million.
[08:17:25.512 --> 08:17:28.975]  Now it says 400 something on it because it just, we have to restart it every few hours.
[08:17:29.015 --> 08:17:29.776]  I guess that cut out.
[08:17:30.497 --> 08:17:31.558]  And this stuff comes out.
[08:17:31.718 --> 08:17:33.219]  So, you need to go to the feeds.
[08:17:33.279 --> 08:17:35.101]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[08:17:35.461 --> 08:17:38.443]  So let's go to the Haiti report, the Nigel Farage report, and more.
[08:17:38.723 --> 08:17:40.924]  I'm Alex Jones from the Infowars News Center in Austin, Texas.
[08:17:41.324 --> 08:17:49.288]  If you're watching this transmission and taking action, no matter what color you are, or you're a man or a woman, or where you're from, if you're against the New World Order takeover, you are the resistance.
[08:17:51.549 --> 08:17:55.871]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[08:17:56.072 --> 08:17:58.353]  Americanism, not globalism!
[08:17:58.513 --> 08:18:00.494]  Americanism, not globalism!
[08:18:05.740 --> 08:18:09.327]  If you love black people, why are you destroying Haiti?
[08:18:09.648 --> 08:18:18.083]  Why did you, Mr. Clinton, stop them from the rice that they were producing in Haiti to feed themselves?
[08:18:19.532 --> 08:18:28.736]  In this environment, the most important thing all the rest of us can do is give even small amounts of cash for food, medicine, water, and shelter.
[08:18:29.097 --> 08:18:32.078]  You've got, like, the head of the Senate saying that the Clintons tried to bribe him.
[08:18:32.118 --> 08:18:35.300]  You've got local leaders saying how the Clintons do nothing.
[08:18:35.820 --> 08:18:37.300]  How they just collect all the money.
[08:18:37.941 --> 08:18:40.542]  And it just brings home, these people are damn evil.
[08:18:48.800 --> 08:18:52.204]  This young boy here with a severe injury, we're his only way out of here.
[08:18:52.525 --> 08:18:54.867]  And we're about to put him on our plane.
[08:18:55.088 --> 08:18:58.452]  The UN helicopter we're taking off is empty because they don't do EVAC.
[08:18:58.492 --> 08:19:01.135]  This is what's so frustrating here.
[08:19:01.175 --> 08:19:06.802]  No government help, they won't bring in some food, but they won't do anything interesting, like help an individual.
[08:19:08.237 --> 08:19:09.278]  We're getting him out of here.
[08:19:09.778 --> 08:19:16.062]  An old man on the stretcher with a spinal cord injury and America needs to know what's going on here.
[08:19:16.102 --> 08:19:21.005]  This is an absolute disaster and Obama sent in six or seven helicopters.
[08:19:21.025 --> 08:19:24.427]  They're all going home in a few days and people are starving.
[08:19:24.467 --> 08:19:25.448]  They don't have no water.
[08:19:26.028 --> 08:19:31.712]  This person was injured in a hurricane, which was seven or eight days ago, and we're just now getting him to a hospital.
[08:19:31.732 --> 08:19:41.818]  So anybody who cares about this, cares about the Haitian people, you need to call your congressman, you need to call your media, because this is a completely ignored story.
[08:19:41.838 --> 08:19:48.122]  A million people on this peninsula in western Haiti without water, without food, without medical care.
[08:19:50.564 --> 08:19:56.710]  Very, very little is being done by the international community and by the American government.
[08:19:57.290 --> 08:20:02.135]  And so, I saw only four stories in the entire media yesterday on the Haitian program.
[08:20:02.155 --> 08:20:04.037]  There's a million people in distress.
[08:20:04.457 --> 08:20:05.238]  This is important.
[08:20:05.558 --> 08:20:07.659]  You've got the Clinton Foundation here, but guess where they're at?
[08:20:07.960 --> 08:20:13.223]  In Port-au-Prince, willin' and dealin' at the Marriott, you know, trying to put money in their own pockets.
[08:20:13.243 --> 08:20:20.528]  Meanwhile, you've got people here with their legs snapped, fractured backs, trying to get help, trying to get out of here, trying to seek the medical attention they deserve and they should have.
[08:20:21.108 --> 08:20:26.332]  And these people are more concerned with putting money in their own pockets and benefiting their lives and their families later on down the road.
[08:20:26.352 --> 08:20:31.315]  When you have people here... Let me say, this guy's an EMT, and he's been doing this for quite a while.
[08:20:31.495 --> 08:20:35.118]  How much Clinton Fund money have you seen actually put into the hands of Haitians?
[08:20:35.758 --> 08:20:36.878]  Absolutely nothing right now.
[08:20:36.898 --> 08:20:38.719]  Because we've been here since what?
[08:20:39.219 --> 08:20:39.879]  Last Wednesday?
[08:20:40.099 --> 08:20:40.239]  Yep.
[08:20:40.619 --> 08:20:41.559]  We haven't seen nothing yet.
[08:20:42.340 --> 08:20:44.620]  Most of the Haitians consider Hillary Clinton a thief.
[08:20:44.780 --> 08:20:46.881]  Would that be an accurate description?
[08:20:47.221 --> 08:20:47.941]  I would say yes.
[08:20:48.241 --> 08:20:48.421]  Yeah.
[08:20:48.721 --> 08:20:52.962]  Because that's what they, I mean, it's been going on for quite a while.
[08:20:53.402 --> 08:20:54.022]  So January 2010?
[08:20:54.062 --> 08:20:54.282]  Yep.
[08:20:54.302 --> 08:20:54.542]  Yeah.
[08:20:54.642 --> 08:20:56.423]  And before that?
[08:20:57.372 --> 08:20:58.452]  So this is it.
[08:20:58.812 --> 08:21:01.493]  They're already digging their fingers in Haiti before it happened.
[08:21:01.513 --> 08:21:10.076]  And then when that catastrophic event took place, they seized it, jumped in here, and then took a hold of that natural disaster and then used it as a way to benefit themselves.
[08:21:10.096 --> 08:21:11.116]  And that's what they always do.
[08:21:11.756 --> 08:21:21.779]  And we have absolute proof that the Clintons have put nothing into Haiti other than getting a gold mine for Hillary's brother and their rich friends.
[08:21:22.279 --> 08:21:24.219]  I don't see major organizations down here.
[08:21:24.239 --> 08:21:26.420]  I don't see major organizations out in that area.
[08:21:26.460 --> 08:21:27.640]  We're the only ones out there.
[08:21:27.960 --> 08:21:31.521]  Hero is literally the only one out there in Danmuri doing this work.
[08:21:31.561 --> 08:21:37.542]  And Danmuri is one of the most affected areas where the hurricane went through and devastated the entire town.
[08:21:37.862 --> 08:21:42.963]  So we have a bunch of people without homes, without food, without shelter, and in need of medical assistance.
[08:21:43.083 --> 08:21:49.845]  So that in itself should be screaming out to the world that, yes, we need eyes back on Haiti because
[08:21:50.305 --> 08:21:51.265]  We can't do it alone.
[08:21:51.325 --> 08:21:54.366]  We desperately need help.
[08:21:54.386 --> 08:22:07.850]  What's amazing, aside from some small-scale US military aid and some other Christian organizations, yesterday I looked around and I thought, I wonder where the religion of peace is at?
[08:22:07.870 --> 08:22:08.290]  You know what?
[08:22:08.650 --> 08:22:11.011]  Why aren't these guys down here helping out?
[08:22:11.071 --> 08:22:16.613]  Where's the Clinton Foundation that's collected hundreds of millions of dollars for the earthquake and dispensed
[08:22:17.473 --> 08:22:23.397]  You know, if these Asian people were lucky, they got 10 cents on the dollar out of that.
[08:22:23.517 --> 08:22:26.639]  And I think the large part of it is really the blame on the media.
[08:22:26.659 --> 08:22:28.760]  The media hasn't covered this story.
[08:22:28.800 --> 08:22:30.441]  I mean, this country's devastated.
[08:22:30.861 --> 08:22:34.704]  Haiti Air Ambulance, a great organization with a beautiful helicopter.
[08:22:36.484 --> 08:22:44.808]  Ambulance staff wants to come here and take our patients, but they can't go round trip on one tank of gas, okay?
[08:22:44.828 --> 08:22:48.249]  The only people they can get gas from out here is UNISTA, UNISTA.
[08:22:48.830 --> 08:22:52.451]  And they won't sell them gas, because they need it for their operation.
[08:22:54.232 --> 08:22:56.153]  They won't let us do medevacs on the U.N.
[08:22:56.173 --> 08:22:56.413]  planes.
[08:22:56.873 --> 08:23:01.395]  They won't let us do medevacs on the Army planes.
[08:23:02.185 --> 08:23:04.466]  The Army won't let you do medevac, right?
[08:23:04.506 --> 08:23:05.407]  The Army won't let us.
[08:23:05.427 --> 08:23:07.167]  They won't come here and take our people.
[08:23:07.207 --> 08:23:12.510]  Tell us what the Clinton Fund has done for you.
[08:23:12.530 --> 08:23:13.791]  Where's the Clinton Foundation?
[08:23:13.811 --> 08:23:14.831]  Where's everybody?
[08:23:15.231 --> 08:23:17.953]  I could be anywhere in the world doing anything I want to do.
[08:23:19.153 --> 08:23:22.315]  I wouldn't trade any of it for this experience.
[08:23:22.695 --> 08:23:23.935]  I've been here 10 days now.
[08:23:24.776 --> 08:23:26.076]  I don't know when I'm going to leave.
[08:23:26.477 --> 08:23:27.577]  I can't leave.
[08:23:27.657 --> 08:23:31.039]  People are depending on me for food and me only.
[08:23:31.779 --> 08:23:35.941]  I'd say it's humbling, but it's the most satisfying thing I think I've ever done in my life.
[08:23:36.021 --> 08:23:43.265]  The joy of holding a little baby and putting him on the plane and knowing that we're going to take him to a life-saving operation.
[08:23:44.246 --> 08:23:45.787]  I'd say it's a thrill.
[08:23:47.147 --> 08:23:51.910]  The negative is being an eyewitness to the corruption.
[08:23:52.640 --> 08:24:00.123]  In the Hillary Clinton program, the Clinton Foundation, we go back to what can our listeners do?
[08:24:00.623 --> 08:24:03.385]  They need to make this stuff go viral.
[08:24:03.425 --> 08:24:07.226]  Terry and Diane have been down here with their own caravans.
[08:24:07.306 --> 08:24:08.647]  They came down with three planes.
[08:24:09.627 --> 08:24:14.389]  And we've been providing help to Dan-Marie, Lekay, and Jeremy.
[08:24:15.410 --> 08:24:18.731]  They have been the only ones able to distribute
[08:24:19.466 --> 08:24:20.968]  To about 3,000 people.
[08:24:21.008 --> 08:24:25.294]  Basically food, water, oil.
[08:24:26.196 --> 08:24:29.080]  The basic needs for any human being.
[08:24:29.641 --> 08:24:30.922]  We don't see the Red Cross.
[08:24:31.744 --> 08:24:35.569]  We haven't seen the Clinton Foundation doing anything in Haiti.
[08:24:36.676 --> 08:24:42.719]  We are the only ones medevacking those trauma people and that Marie.
[08:24:43.359 --> 08:24:47.802]  We're the only flights landing there, getting people out that need to be medevacked.
[08:24:48.162 --> 08:24:49.483]  Hillary, let me give you a word.
[08:24:49.543 --> 08:24:51.824]  First of all, I'm wealthier than you are.
[08:24:52.164 --> 08:24:57.407]  And here I am with my money, my hands, I'm flying aircraft into these dangerous situations.
[08:24:58.848 --> 08:25:06.594]  The head of the Senate here in Haiti said that of the billions that you collected for these children here, only 2%, 2%.
[08:25:08.275 --> 08:25:14.620]  You are a grand level thief, and the world needs to know about it.
[08:25:14.740 --> 08:25:16.061]  Americans need to know about it.
[08:25:16.081 --> 08:25:19.763]  If we dare trust you with anything, we're fools.
[08:25:20.704 --> 08:25:23.046]  And you've proven it over and over again.
[08:25:23.086 --> 08:25:25.548]  But Haiti, you can't explain this away.
[08:25:26.650 --> 08:25:29.613]  Look around, you see any Clinton fund trucks or airplanes?
[08:25:30.033 --> 08:25:33.736]  It isn't here, and I'm an eyewitness.
[08:25:33.796 --> 08:25:37.199]  You have the audacity to act as if you care about people.
[08:25:38.200 --> 08:25:44.325]  And I know you're a psychopath, but you probably get a kick out of the fact that you're getting away with this grand theft.
[08:25:45.146 --> 08:25:49.470]  And it's because the media, the mainstream media in America, is your lapdog.
[08:25:49.990 --> 08:25:55.353]  I don't know whether they're afraid of you, or they buy into your nonsense, but I'm not afraid of you.
[08:25:55.473 --> 08:26:04.318]  I'm gonna challenge you everywhere I can, and I'm asking the hundreds of thousands of people who are watching this to get involved, get the war down, get this viral.
[08:26:04.878 --> 08:26:17.025]  Hillary Clinton is, with what you've done in selling state secrets, selling uranium to our so-called enemy, picking a fight with Russia, taking us to the verge of World War III.
[08:26:17.525 --> 08:26:18.886]  Media doesn't tell us about it.
[08:26:19.546 --> 08:26:22.389]  You are the most wicked person on this planet.
[08:26:22.869 --> 08:26:29.154]  And every time I put a food in the mouth of these children, I think of what a creepy witch you are.
[08:26:30.295 --> 08:26:31.296]  So, damn you.
[08:26:32.691 --> 08:26:35.713]  This is what you should be doing, but you don't even understand.
[08:26:36.293 --> 08:26:39.615]  You're a psychopath who gets power off of getting away with this.
[08:26:39.935 --> 08:26:41.916]  And I understand that, you don't care what I'm saying.
[08:26:42.356 --> 08:26:46.218]  The American people that are gonna go vote, especially the black Americans.
[08:26:46.458 --> 08:26:48.619]  These are black people here that I'm taking care of.
[08:26:48.699 --> 08:26:53.842]  The black Americans need to realize that you use them for their vote, and then you throw them away.
[08:26:53.882 --> 08:26:59.705]  You keep America like Detroit, impoverished because you have power and control over black Americans.
[08:27:00.125 --> 08:27:01.746]  Shame on you, they're waking up.
[08:27:02.618 --> 08:27:08.542]  I'm not a great Trump fan, but he's not bought and paid by the elites, not bought and paid by the shadow government.
[08:27:09.443 --> 08:27:20.090]  Hillary, we're onto you, and we have time to wake the American people up and get you out of our lives once and for all, you miserable wretch.
[08:27:25.814 --> 08:27:27.155]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Farage.
[08:27:27.815 --> 08:27:29.056]  Americans have seen a lot of clips.
[08:27:29.076 --> 08:27:30.717]  We know what an effective speaker you are.
[08:27:30.757 --> 08:27:36.901]  We know what a fearless speaker you are, going right to the seat of power and taking them on, speaking truth to them.
[08:27:37.221 --> 08:27:41.263]  I want to ask you what Donald Trump needs to do in this final debate tonight.
[08:27:41.403 --> 08:27:43.885]  You see, I think that in the first debate,
[08:27:44.825 --> 08:27:45.706]  She had the better of him.
[08:27:47.006 --> 08:27:48.367]  And that's down to experience.
[08:27:49.047 --> 08:27:51.788]  You know, he was stepping up to a level that he'd never been at before.
[08:27:52.128 --> 08:27:52.849]  I've been there myself.
[08:27:53.789 --> 08:28:10.737]  I've done these big debates and I know that when you're somewhat virginal, going into these things, well we can call Trump virginal perhaps as a matter of conjecture, but you know, when you're going into these things, and you've never done them before, they're tough, but I felt at the end of the second debate, he completely dominated.
[08:28:11.417 --> 08:28:16.322]  He didn't just dominate her, he dominated the people doing the debates with the moderators.
[08:28:16.382 --> 08:28:19.985]  He said he was three against one situation, he called him out on it.
[08:28:20.046 --> 08:28:20.446]  And he did.
[08:28:20.806 --> 08:28:21.987]  And he was right to do so.
[08:28:22.208 --> 08:28:26.872]  So I think psychologically, he comes to Las Vegas with the upper hand.
[08:28:27.573 --> 08:28:30.496]  She's going to be very nervous going into this tonight.
[08:28:31.116 --> 08:28:32.297]  She's going to play very safe.
[08:28:33.298 --> 08:28:38.501]  Um, and I think he's gonna, I think he will go in and look for the knockout blow.
[08:28:39.141 --> 08:28:40.562]  Let's talk to the voters for a second.
[08:28:40.962 --> 08:28:48.606]  But when I look at what you did in England, it reminds me of William Wilberforce, the guy who ended slavery virtually single-handedly.
[08:28:48.626 --> 08:28:53.649]  It's what you did when you went to the European Union and you said, uh, we're going to get Britain out of the European Union.
[08:28:54.389 --> 08:28:58.011]  William Wilberforce for his entire life took on the moneyed and
[08:28:58.131 --> 08:28:58.611]  We're good to go.
[08:29:21.869 --> 08:29:24.592]  Yes, and don't think that this is just America and Britain.
[08:29:37.569 --> 08:29:54.241]  This is actually happening across a lot of Europe as well, and very important that we remember that we've got people in France and Germany and Hungary and Italy and everywhere you go now, people are saying, you know, the global elite have led us very badly, the rich have got richer, the poor have got poorer, this simply isn't working.
[08:29:54.301 --> 08:29:58.104]  And the one thing I would say is, you know, whatever happens,
[08:29:59.096 --> 08:30:04.078]  Here, on November the 8th, American politics is never going to be the same again.
[08:30:04.298 --> 08:30:05.299]  That's right.
[08:30:05.359 --> 08:30:06.979]  It simply can't be, because you're right.
[08:30:07.800 --> 08:30:11.881]  Actually, I mean, Trump's not a Republican candidate, he's an Independent.
[08:30:12.142 --> 08:30:13.562]  Yeah, he's taken over the party!
[08:30:13.602 --> 08:30:14.282]  He is now!
[08:30:14.322 --> 08:30:16.063]  You're the one sleeping in front of him!
[08:30:16.103 --> 08:30:18.084]  You know, and everyone's run away from him.
[08:30:18.764 --> 08:30:20.085]  He's effectively an Independent.
[08:30:20.265 --> 08:30:23.086]  Now, if he wins, he wins, and America changes course.
[08:30:23.846 --> 08:30:24.707]  But if he doesn't win,
[08:30:25.620 --> 08:30:31.282]  If the establishment win this time, that is not the end of this story.
[08:30:31.542 --> 08:30:36.925]  Because all those people that will have been motivated to stand up and do something, they're not going to go away.
[08:30:36.945 --> 08:30:38.425]  They're not going to disappear.
[08:30:39.165 --> 08:30:42.367]  So, yeah, I think ultimately, you know, we toppled
[08:30:43.107 --> 08:30:44.707]  The establishment in the United Kingdom.
[08:30:44.727 --> 08:30:50.088]  It took us a very, very long time and a whole number of false starts, but we've done it.
[08:30:50.188 --> 08:30:52.769]  And I think that is going to happen in the USA.
[08:30:53.189 --> 08:30:55.730]  It's just a question of whether it's this year or whether you have to wait a bit.
[08:30:56.190 --> 08:31:11.493]  I think we need to sort of start getting the ghosts of Thatcher and Reagan going on the small man and small woman who want to take risk, set up their own little businesses, and who ultimately create real wealth.
[08:31:12.213 --> 08:31:14.374]  Within the economy and create real jobs.
[08:31:14.414 --> 08:31:17.094]  And that is the opportunity that we now have.
[08:31:17.775 --> 08:31:18.935]  We voted for Brexit.
[08:31:19.235 --> 08:31:21.736]  Yeah, sure, it's going to take us two or three years to sort it all out.
[08:31:22.096 --> 08:31:30.158]  But we've now got a chance to move back towards a genuine capitalist system where people have got a chance of succeeding.
[08:31:30.358 --> 08:31:33.739]  And that, I think, didn't you guys used to call this the American dream?
[08:31:34.099 --> 08:31:34.479]  That's right.
[08:31:34.719 --> 08:31:36.401]  And we used to call it a Declaration of Independence.
[08:31:36.421 --> 08:31:42.965]  We said we're going to take back our freedom, our property, and our self-governance from a small, globalist cabal.
[08:31:43.506 --> 08:31:53.593]  I would just finish by saying that whatever happens tonight in this big showdown in Vegas, there's a couple of weeks of full campaigning left.
[08:31:54.333 --> 08:32:01.959]  And what the Trump campaign need to do is to try and get a national conversation going on the very things you and I have just talked about for the last three minutes.
[08:32:02.079 --> 08:32:02.499]  Absolutely.
[08:32:02.519 --> 08:32:03.120]  Thank you so much.
[08:32:03.160 --> 08:32:03.480]  Thank you.
[08:32:05.111 --> 08:32:09.420]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[08:32:12.066 --> 08:32:14.050]  Americanism, not globalism!
[08:32:17.281 --> 08:32:21.462]  Well, I'm going to reveal a big Trump secret here that if you research it isn't a secret at all.
[08:32:22.102 --> 08:32:27.903]  Trump a few years ago had patriots in the military, you name it, coming to him and talking about the fact that the U.S.
[08:32:27.943 --> 08:32:30.024]  was going under the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[08:32:30.804 --> 08:32:33.865]  And that he had to go to the TPP to even be able to build hotels overseas.
[08:32:34.445 --> 08:32:35.825]  Or to be able to build hotels here in the U.S.
[08:32:35.865 --> 08:32:36.625]  He's like, what the hell?
[08:32:37.025 --> 08:32:39.686]  This is 10 times worse than Afghanistan, which he was against 25 years ago.
[08:32:40.886 --> 08:32:45.210]  He wrote big op-eds in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to put him in.
[08:32:45.290 --> 08:32:47.031]  So he's an Americana guy.
[08:32:47.051 --> 08:32:48.492]  He's not a liberal, he's not a conservative.
[08:32:48.913 --> 08:32:49.653]  He's a populist.
[08:32:50.934 --> 08:32:54.037]  And so he basically got drafted to run for president against globalism.
[08:32:54.137 --> 08:32:58.100]  You've seen the power of the UKIP getting out of the EU with Brexit.
[08:32:58.120 --> 08:33:00.602]  You've seen Russia pulling out of the EU and the rest of it.
[08:33:02.011 --> 08:33:06.714]  So all that's happening is America's trying to re-establish itself and not have special interests run things.
[08:33:07.154 --> 08:33:12.858]  And even mainstream media admits they're run by special interests and foreign interests that are setting up this global government.
[08:33:12.918 --> 08:33:14.679]  They admit a shadow government runs things now.
[08:33:15.199 --> 08:33:17.161]  So everything we talked about is now out in the open.
[08:33:17.181 --> 08:33:18.301]  Do we get a Pulitzer Prize?
[08:33:18.662 --> 08:33:20.903]  Quite frankly, I don't want some mainstream prize.
[08:33:22.244 --> 08:33:28.348]  Our real prize is reaching 30 million people a week and Infowars being a leading resistance with Hillary and Obama.
[08:33:29.645 --> 08:33:32.227]  The UN and the globalists attacking us by name.
[08:33:32.607 --> 08:33:35.189]  We're having a big effect because Gandhi first said it.
[08:33:36.230 --> 08:33:36.850]  He spelled it out.
[08:33:36.890 --> 08:33:41.153]  He said first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[08:33:41.733 --> 08:33:43.495]  And we're now in the attack you face.
[08:33:44.386 --> 08:33:45.247]  So this is historical.
[08:33:45.287 --> 08:33:48.651]  Whether Trump wins or loses, globalism is in trouble.
[08:33:49.172 --> 08:33:50.453]  Globalism is on the ropes.
[08:33:50.533 --> 08:33:51.314]  It's being reversed.
[08:33:51.434 --> 08:33:53.897]  And, my God, Trump says some stuff I don't agree with.
[08:33:54.277 --> 08:33:54.938]  Nobody's perfect.
[08:33:55.539 --> 08:33:57.881]  Hillary, though, is like the consummate demon.
[08:33:58.062 --> 08:34:01.345]  This is so archetypal, or like a Greek tragedy, or biblical.
[08:34:02.410 --> 08:34:09.016]  It's legendary that he's just such an outsider from the corporate elite, his own self-made guy, like America was.
[08:34:09.837 --> 08:34:19.885]  Versus this blue-blood, George III, you know, Hillary, with all the big power structures behind her, doing everything they can to bring in this system and break the will of the people.
[08:34:19.925 --> 08:34:23.308]  And all the emails, all the... Why do you think our own government's leaking emails?
[08:34:23.568 --> 08:34:24.689]  Why do you think foreign governments are?
[08:34:24.709 --> 08:34:25.690]  Why do you think corporations are?
[08:34:25.950 --> 08:34:29.493]  Because everybody that's informed, Liberal, Conservative, Jill Stein of the Green Party,
[08:34:31.234 --> 08:34:33.916]  You know, you've got people that are super conservative, like Nigel Farage of UKIP.
[08:34:33.936 --> 08:34:38.519]  You've got people like Julian Assange, that's classically liberal, saying Hillary's, quote, a demon.
[08:34:39.379 --> 08:34:41.421]  And then you've got Bill saying she works like a demon.
[08:34:41.441 --> 08:34:45.343]  And then you've got myself saying she's a demon, and they go, he says she's a literal demon.
[08:34:45.923 --> 08:34:47.084]  She's evil, folks.
[08:34:47.124 --> 08:34:48.665]  She represents the Communist Chinese.
[08:34:48.925 --> 08:34:50.026]  She sold the country out.
[08:34:50.967 --> 08:34:56.170]  But it's funny, when she was shut out, she's representing the Chinese president against China for special interests.
[08:34:56.810 --> 08:34:58.011]  She's screwing everybody.
[08:34:59.380 --> 08:35:04.241]  You got multinationals that want to dominate this world, and they need a sellout like Hillary that's out to get America to do it.
[08:35:04.341 --> 08:35:09.302]  And hey, folks, Trump's really ahead in most internal polls, neck and neck in the battleground states.
[08:35:10.883 --> 08:35:12.483]  The feds say they're federalizing the election.
[08:35:12.523 --> 08:35:15.664]  Nobody can deny that, to protect it, because there's unprecedented fraud.
[08:35:16.204 --> 08:35:17.324]  But election fraud doesn't exist.
[08:35:17.505 --> 08:35:18.905]  When Donald Trump brings it up, it's totally insane.
[08:35:19.975 --> 08:35:22.336]  Again, I heard on NPR, they'll go, Trump is insane.
[08:35:22.356 --> 08:35:23.437]  He says there's election fraud.
[08:35:23.957 --> 08:35:27.239]  Next, Homeland Security's federalizing to stop election fraud they say is imminent.
[08:35:27.739 --> 08:35:31.241]  So it doesn't exist he's insane, but it's imminent.
[08:35:31.301 --> 08:35:34.303]  I mean, we've reached levels that's like 2 plus 2 equals 500.
[08:35:34.643 --> 08:35:36.544]  And I'm like, no, it equals 4.
[08:35:37.745 --> 08:35:43.068]  So, like Gruber said, thank God the American public are dumb and don't pay attention because Obamacare is about to screw them.
[08:35:43.288 --> 08:35:44.309]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[08:35:45.369 --> 08:35:46.410]  We're going to be covering the debate.
[08:35:47.341 --> 08:35:52.945]  Live tomorrow, from 11am when we kick off, Central, 12 noon, Eastern, right through past midnight with live coverage.
[08:35:53.205 --> 08:35:54.666]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[08:35:55.007 --> 08:35:59.550]  And to symbolize the revolution against tyranny, it took me decades to get 3 million listeners a day on radio.
[08:35:59.850 --> 08:36:00.470]  Terrestrial radio.
[08:36:00.731 --> 08:36:03.292]  On the internet we got like 5 million on YouTube and other platforms a day now.
[08:36:03.853 --> 08:36:06.275]  We have millions tuning in every night when we do these debate coverages.
[08:36:06.595 --> 08:36:08.376]  Let's make it 5 million tomorrow, not 3 million.
[08:36:08.656 --> 08:36:10.798]  Spread the link, Infowars.com forward slash show.
[08:36:11.098 --> 08:36:22.254]  And send another message, no matter what color you are, or where you're from, or whether you're a Democrat or Republican, whoever, that you're done with the corporate media because this election is a referendum on this dead facade that the big corporations are leaving propped up.
[08:36:23.311 --> 08:36:25.232]  Because they dare not even admit it's collapsed.
[08:36:25.392 --> 08:36:28.193]  It's only power is to create hoaxes, and that's all it does.
[08:36:28.734 --> 08:36:31.795]  Find the free app to also pick up the show streaming.
[08:36:32.115 --> 08:36:37.258]  InfoWars.com forward slash app and spread that link as well.
[08:36:37.478 --> 08:36:47.063]  But InfoWars.com forward slash show is the place, if your local station isn't carrying an AM, FM, UHF or cable, to find the free audio and video feeds and the daytime transmission as well.
[08:36:47.503 --> 08:36:49.165]  Infowars.com for its last show.
[08:36:49.506 --> 08:36:50.187]  I'm Alex Jones.
[08:36:50.687 --> 08:36:52.570]  No teleprompters, just telling it like it is.
[08:36:52.930 --> 08:36:56.796]  A true populist standing up for freedom, free association, and prosperity.
[08:37:12.581 --> 08:37:36.489]  Ladies and gentlemen, you are seeing true independent, not left-wing, not right-wing, but constitutional, pro-America, pro-capitalism, pro-family, pro-Second Amendment, pro-Renaissance TV slash radio, and we have over 2 million people watching on our own streams, YouTube and Facebook, right now, conservatively.
[08:37:38.015 --> 08:37:40.538]  Now that's not even my syndicated radio show.
[08:37:40.779 --> 08:37:43.702]  That is a testament to mainstream media and what a joke it is.
[08:37:44.123 --> 08:37:47.267]  The average CNN show has 100,000 viewers.
[08:37:47.928 --> 08:37:49.530]  The average Fox, 1 million.
[08:37:51.032 --> 08:37:51.873]  They are shadows.
[08:37:53.146 --> 08:37:54.146]  of their former selves.
[08:37:54.586 --> 08:38:00.368]  And that's why the White House and everybody else wants to come in and try to bring in the Fairness Doctor to shut down talk radio.
[08:38:00.588 --> 08:38:06.449]  To let them spew all their propaganda, all their vitriol, to say Tea Partiers are all racist, to say Donald Trump's a rapist.
[08:38:06.489 --> 08:38:09.809]  You know, all this BS and then not allow us to respond.
[08:38:09.829 --> 08:38:13.210]  Now we have David down on the ground in Vegas where it's still daytime, we're still light.
[08:38:14.230 --> 08:38:16.391]  We're here at 738 Central, it's 838 Eastern.
[08:38:16.691 --> 08:38:19.391]  Coming up in about 22 minutes is going to be the live debate.
[08:38:19.851 --> 08:38:21.872]  You've got all the old media whores and everybody else there.
[08:38:23.697 --> 08:38:27.298]  Like generals gathered in their masses just like witches at black masses.
[08:38:28.298 --> 08:38:30.099]  And we're going to be breaking down this final showdown.
[08:38:30.139 --> 08:38:40.361]  We got an exclusive interview today in his hotel room with Nigel Farage, the founder 25 years ago, UKIP, who just stepped down earlier this year after the Brexit was successful.
[08:38:41.221 --> 08:38:43.282]  We only aired about a quarter of the interview.
[08:38:43.342 --> 08:38:47.202]  There's another 20 minutes or so that we're going to be doling out tomorrow.
[08:38:47.643 --> 08:38:48.963]  Extremely powerful.
[08:38:50.740 --> 08:38:51.461]  Information.
[08:38:51.821 --> 08:38:53.763]  I was talking about getting Farage on today.
[08:38:54.824 --> 08:38:58.147]  He's the guy they're doing the main debate coaching with Trump and reportedly they've had it off.
[08:38:58.407 --> 08:39:03.312]  Whereas Roger Ailes and he were friends, Trump wouldn't follow some of his advice.
[08:39:03.332 --> 08:39:05.153]  It's really worked well because the two men mesh.
[08:39:05.554 --> 08:39:08.697]  He's not kind of following his orders or advice, but it's just working.
[08:39:09.878 --> 08:39:15.283]  And so we were able to talk to Nigel Farage, really who helped Trump absolutely devastate Hillary in the last debate.
[08:39:15.303 --> 08:39:16.124]  He's predicting
[08:39:17.250 --> 08:39:20.392]  Quote, Trump will destroy Hillary in the final debate, and I love what he said.
[08:39:20.412 --> 08:39:21.893]  It's exactly what I've said, because it's true.
[08:39:22.834 --> 08:39:26.717]  Even if we don't win this or they steal it, it took them 25 years.
[08:39:27.337 --> 08:39:29.278]  America just woke up to globalism in the last couple of years.
[08:39:29.619 --> 08:39:38.285]  We've gone from Alex Jones being unknown, Ron Paul being kind of a side issue, with Drudge and others helping push the truth, to now everybody's following our cue.
[08:39:38.345 --> 08:39:39.486]  We're the future, they're the past.
[08:39:41.169 --> 08:39:42.070]  Let's keep our powder dry.
[08:39:42.090 --> 08:39:42.830]  Let's be peaceful.
[08:39:42.850 --> 08:39:43.550]  Let's get the word out.
[08:39:43.590 --> 08:39:45.011]  They're the ones that want to start a revolution.
[08:39:45.572 --> 08:39:51.875]  They're the ones that want to start a civil war with over a billion dollars given to Black Lives Matter and other leftist groups to cause destabilization.
[08:39:51.895 --> 08:39:52.656]  We have the WikiLeaks.
[08:39:52.676 --> 08:40:00.901]  Just like we told you in March, we had sources, that Soros was funding people to attack Trump rallies to say he was violent and to dress him up like Sanders supporters.
[08:40:01.341 --> 08:40:06.044]  More of those emails came out to blame Sanders and blame Trump people because that's who the establishment fears.
[08:40:06.084 --> 08:40:07.105]  Not that Sanders is perfect, but
[08:40:08.066 --> 08:40:09.406]  I'll give him this, the establishment didn't like him.
[08:40:09.646 --> 08:40:10.567]  So that's a big plus.
[08:40:11.267 --> 08:40:13.007]  And so, that's all come out in Wikileaks.
[08:40:13.047 --> 08:40:15.908]  And the shadow government protecting Hillary, and Hillary trying to bribe the FBI.
[08:40:16.228 --> 08:40:18.369]  They will not survive this, politically.
[08:40:19.049 --> 08:40:23.691]  He may limp across, steal the election, call in some COG, but time is on our side.
[08:40:24.251 --> 08:40:27.872]  And as Faraj said in the epic five minute clip we just played, it's up on InfoWars.com,
[08:40:29.619 --> 08:40:30.340]  We're on the march.
[08:40:30.380 --> 08:40:31.280]  The empire's on the run.
[08:40:31.320 --> 08:40:35.683]  The empire of tyranny and despotism and systems of conquest is on the run.
[08:40:36.544 --> 08:40:40.206]  The re-emergence of renaissance free association is on the rise.
[08:40:40.367 --> 08:40:43.729]  And all the political terms you hear don't matter.
[08:40:43.749 --> 08:40:45.270]  The Republican evil establishment.
[08:40:45.330 --> 08:40:47.031]  I get why Democrats before didn't like Republicans.
[08:40:47.211 --> 08:40:48.492]  They're horrible just like the Democrats.
[08:40:48.512 --> 08:40:50.414]  Now you don't have that excuse, Democrats.
[08:40:50.754 --> 08:40:51.434]  This is real!
[08:40:52.355 --> 08:40:56.298]  And the whole big corporate system you claim you hate and all these foreign evil governments
[08:40:58.376 --> 08:41:00.518]  China killing millions of its people every few years.
[08:41:00.898 --> 08:41:02.479]  They're all lined up against Donald J. Trump.
[08:41:02.499 --> 08:41:03.019]  What does that say?
[08:41:03.039 --> 08:41:11.366]  Joining us from out front, the Convention Center, where all this is happening, is David Knight, a reporter there on the ground.
[08:41:11.406 --> 08:41:12.907]  David, I know more is coming up tonight.
[08:41:13.267 --> 08:41:14.108]  So much unfolding.
[08:41:14.148 --> 08:41:15.088]  Great job, my friend.
[08:41:15.409 --> 08:41:16.650]  An exciting time to be alive.
[08:41:16.950 --> 08:41:19.071]  David Knight, your view on what's about to happen.
[08:41:20.252 --> 08:41:20.753]  Thank you, Alex.
[08:41:20.793 --> 08:41:22.454]  David Knight here in Las Vegas.
[08:41:23.109 --> 08:41:30.512]  We just finished a press conference with Danny Williams, and I don't know if you saw any of that, Alex, but it was... We heard a lot!
[08:41:30.612 --> 08:41:35.293]  It was a disgrace the way they treated that man, the way they attacked him.
[08:41:35.613 --> 08:41:37.094]  I was absolutely disgusted.
[08:41:37.734 --> 08:41:45.137]  I tried to make clear that he hasn't been doing this just in the last couple of days, not even in the last year.
[08:41:45.437 --> 08:41:46.177]  Did they ask
[08:41:46.457 --> 08:41:47.677]  The people who are accusing Donald Trump.
[08:41:47.697 --> 08:41:49.118]  They just kept saying, is Trump funding you?
[08:41:49.158 --> 08:41:50.378]  And he kept saying, no, no, no.
[08:41:50.718 --> 08:41:53.038]  Even when he was here, I said, how are you here?
[08:41:53.599 --> 08:41:55.159]  And he said, well, I saved up my money.
[08:41:55.239 --> 08:41:55.699]  I'm broke.
[08:41:56.099 --> 08:41:57.579]  I got to get back to my kids and my job.
[08:41:57.619 --> 08:42:00.380]  And I said, excuse me, I'm going to pay for your hotel.
[08:42:00.540 --> 08:42:01.680]  I didn't realize you came here.
[08:42:01.780 --> 08:42:02.600]  I said, is anybody helping you?
[08:42:02.620 --> 08:42:05.561]  He goes, no, they don't want to be involved.
[08:42:05.581 --> 08:42:08.802]  And I'm like, well, I remember interviewing your aunt 20 years ago.
[08:42:08.822 --> 08:42:10.562]  I said, you know, here's $3,000 with me.
[08:42:10.582 --> 08:42:11.502]  He's looking for who gave him money.
[08:42:11.542 --> 08:42:13.243]  I mean, I did, but it wasn't to get him to tell a story.
[08:42:13.263 --> 08:42:14.823]  I was interviewing his aunt 20 years ago.
[08:42:15.922 --> 08:42:16.082]  Yeah.
[08:42:16.462 --> 08:42:17.823]  Well, what they did was they attacked him.
[08:42:17.843 --> 08:42:20.185]  They don't ask these accusers, who's funding you?
[08:42:20.225 --> 08:42:26.910]  They don't ask them, where were you 35 years ago when you alleged that this happened at a concert that didn't exist?
[08:42:27.230 --> 08:42:33.495]  They don't ask those kind of questions of Trump's accusers, and yet they continually try to imply that this is some new thing that he just made up.
[08:42:33.515 --> 08:42:35.777]  Well, sure, they changed the subject onto us calculating it.
[08:42:35.797 --> 08:42:36.698]  When we have the WikiLeaks,
[08:42:37.618 --> 08:42:42.002]  The Clintons are running CNN, running MSNBC, running ABC, NBC, CBS.
[08:42:42.302 --> 08:42:43.743]  They are now more and more running Fox.
[08:42:43.963 --> 08:42:46.946]  They are running the New York Times, telling them every decision to make.
[08:42:46.966 --> 08:42:49.848]  I mean, my God, Clinton's got interns running the New York Times.
[08:42:50.768 --> 08:42:56.473]  Well, it was a snarky comment that especially that reporter... The arrogance of that Daily Beast person was pig-like.
[08:42:57.256 --> 08:42:58.077]  Yes, absolutely.
[08:42:58.377 --> 08:43:00.419]  But just the innuendo that they had of it.
[08:43:00.959 --> 08:43:02.761]  This is a guy who really is struggling.
[08:43:03.302 --> 08:43:06.164]  He's been working all of his life to try to determine who his father is.
[08:43:06.605 --> 08:43:12.330]  Bill Clinton, let's say this, Bill Clinton could shut this thing down tomorrow if he would do a DNA test.
[08:43:12.590 --> 08:43:13.130]  He won't do it.
[08:43:13.371 --> 08:43:18.375]  He gets his friend who runs the Star to say that there was a DNA test that never existed.
[08:43:18.395 --> 08:43:20.277]  Now the editor admits it never existed.
[08:43:20.497 --> 08:43:22.319]  They lied about it 17 years ago.
[08:43:24.099 --> 08:43:26.541]  And they're continually lying with the help of the media.
[08:43:26.821 --> 08:43:35.928]  It was the New York Daily News that came out and reported that the star had said that the DNA... No, no, David, shifting gears was the debate... So it's all working in collusion, that's what we're seeing happening here.
[08:43:35.968 --> 08:43:37.229]  Sure, the debate's 15 minutes out.
[08:43:37.710 --> 08:43:41.272]  And we know Danny, we believe him, we're obviously got skill in the game here, we care about him.
[08:43:41.413 --> 08:43:42.794]  But shifting gears out of that, because...
[08:43:43.294 --> 08:43:50.076]  We've got thousands of emails per day coming out that we're trying to go through with bribing FBI, FBI memos.
[08:43:50.096 --> 08:43:51.396]  The FBI's released some of this stuff.
[08:43:52.076 --> 08:43:54.837]  Clinton being run by a shadow government taking over the investigation.
[08:43:55.217 --> 08:43:56.997]  Keep the public in the dark, keep them dumb.
[08:43:57.417 --> 08:44:00.118]  Money from Chinese leaders selling out the country.
[08:44:00.158 --> 08:44:01.378]  Hey, this is illegal, so what?
[08:44:01.418 --> 08:44:01.999]  Take the money.
[08:44:02.859 --> 08:44:04.939]  Chelsea, oh my God, we're killing thousands of Haitians.
[08:44:04.959 --> 08:44:06.340]  Dad, Mom, why won't you give them the money?
[08:44:06.860 --> 08:44:11.741]  I mean, we have all of this, each one, and it just shows this corporate media
[08:44:12.501 --> 08:44:16.804]  That is just defending this to the end, regardless of what's happening.
[08:44:16.844 --> 08:44:25.489]  We're seeing the self-immolation of the mainstream media, the final funeral prior, Donald Trump and this whole movement, whether we win, lose, draw, whatever.
[08:44:25.509 --> 08:44:32.913]  As quite frankly, he gets in, the real war starts, the sabotage, the economic war like Brexit, the disinformation, all of it.
[08:44:35.012 --> 08:44:35.932]  We're just doing the right thing.
[08:44:35.972 --> 08:44:37.453]  Hell, Hillary gets in, our show gets bigger.
[08:44:37.813 --> 08:44:38.413]  It isn't about that.
[08:44:38.433 --> 08:44:41.354]  It's about telling the truth, let the chips fall where they may.
[08:44:41.614 --> 08:44:42.314]  That's all we do.
[08:44:42.334 --> 08:44:44.555]  But, I mean, thousands more emails a day.
[08:44:44.615 --> 08:44:46.555]  The Ecuadorian embassy's email cut off.
[08:44:46.595 --> 08:44:47.976]  Their internet cut off.
[08:44:48.376 --> 08:44:49.356]  All this stuff happening.
[08:44:49.376 --> 08:44:51.356]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[08:44:51.677 --> 08:44:57.718]  And I'm so proud of people like you and our listeners and our affiliates and patriots worldwide of every race, color and creed that care about truth.
[08:44:58.038 --> 08:44:59.059]  And I am so ashamed.
[08:44:59.099 --> 08:45:02.539]  I mean, I've never really felt like this where I don't even hate these people anymore.
[08:45:02.760 --> 08:45:03.940]  I am ashamed.
[08:45:04.620 --> 08:45:12.410]  Of the fawning, foaming worship and just lapdog isn't even the word of these people.
[08:45:12.750 --> 08:45:13.251]  But I get it.
[08:45:13.291 --> 08:45:14.412]  Their industry is collapsing.
[08:45:14.432 --> 08:45:15.193]  They've cut their pay.
[08:45:15.213 --> 08:45:16.815]  They've told them, we're taking over.
[08:45:17.095 --> 08:45:18.497]  We're going to shut down the new media.
[08:45:18.757 --> 08:45:20.039]  You're going to be a big star.
[08:45:20.599 --> 08:45:22.221]  But you can tell these are hacks.
[08:45:23.106 --> 08:45:24.507]  I mean, I'm not intelligent.
[08:45:24.827 --> 08:45:25.107]  Fat.
[08:45:25.187 --> 08:45:26.247]  I don't mean fat as in a bad way.
[08:45:26.267 --> 08:45:27.007]  I've been fat.
[08:45:27.047 --> 08:45:29.068]  But not major material for TV.
[08:45:29.348 --> 08:45:36.751]  They are throwing, like Hitler Youth, like Hitler did as Berlin fell in 1945, they're throwing the conscripts now at us.
[08:45:37.011 --> 08:45:42.993]  We're mowing them down with truth, and these poor stupid conscripts are up there with their bazookas trying to take our tanks out.
[08:45:43.033 --> 08:45:45.474]  We're mowing them down, and I feel sorry for them.
[08:45:45.754 --> 08:45:48.055]  You know, like, I finally got family to talk about World War II stories.
[08:45:48.075 --> 08:45:49.076]  They said, okay, you want a World War II story?
[08:45:49.376 --> 08:45:53.198]  A beautiful woman comes up in a fur coat, opens it up, starts shooting at your tank, you cut her in half.
[08:45:53.478 --> 08:45:59.402]  I mean, I kind of feel sorry for these people at this point because we are, you know, veterans of the info war.
[08:45:59.622 --> 08:46:00.322]  The people are.
[08:46:00.362 --> 08:46:01.243]  We're rolling forward.
[08:46:01.423 --> 08:46:02.484]  We're cutting them to pieces.
[08:46:02.704 --> 08:46:04.405]  They're new faces every day, David.
[08:46:04.585 --> 08:46:07.366]  They're just throwing in at their hemorrhaging credibility.
[08:46:09.027 --> 08:46:11.629]  You know, Alex, that's the takeaway from this press conference.
[08:46:12.128 --> 08:46:13.309]  We see it in so many different ways.
[08:46:13.469 --> 08:46:18.992]  We're able to go back now and look at what was said a few years ago by the mainstream media, by other people.
[08:46:19.032 --> 08:46:24.035]  So the public themselves with the internet are able to do their own fact-checking of the mainstream media.
[08:46:24.055 --> 08:46:25.095]  They knew that they were lying.
[08:46:25.135 --> 08:46:27.237]  Now we see the documents that have come out from WikiLeaks.
[08:46:27.437 --> 08:46:36.402]  Now we see the press conference in here where they're attacking him and the way that they're attacking him and not asking those same questions of the other people when he has a genuine issue here.
[08:46:36.602 --> 08:46:41.865]  So it's the phony media, just as you were saying, and we're seeing it across the entire spectrum.
[08:46:42.025 --> 08:46:43.106]  Well, let's get back to Farage.
[08:46:43.146 --> 08:46:43.946]  What a big interview.
[08:46:44.386 --> 08:46:47.628]  You know, like I say, average person doesn't know who Chuck Yeager is or George Washington.
[08:46:47.648 --> 08:46:49.930]  But, you know, Nigel Farage, such a huge figure.
[08:46:49.970 --> 08:46:53.732]  A few minutes on that and the other parts of the interview that are coming out tonight and tomorrow.
[08:46:54.052 --> 08:46:54.832]  Big interview.
[08:46:55.073 --> 08:46:57.534]  This is the guy that is actually able to advise Trump.
[08:46:57.774 --> 08:46:59.635]  They say nobody else can really get, which is great.
[08:46:59.655 --> 08:47:01.036]  The globalists can't control him and advise him.
[08:47:01.316 --> 08:47:04.578]  So he's actually gotten through to them because they're both, you know, like average guys.
[08:47:04.658 --> 08:47:06.499]  I mean, there's a bromance going on here.
[08:47:06.799 --> 08:47:07.800]  Tell us about what else is coming up.
[08:47:09.059 --> 08:47:14.342]  Well, Alex, as he pointed out, this is a global fight, and this is something that every country is involved in.
[08:47:14.402 --> 08:47:35.051]  They have given their Declaration of Independence from these globalists, and just as I talked about Wilberforce being a lifelong struggle to try to end slavery in England, and this is a guy who was a very close friend to Newton, who wrote Amazing Grace, a guy who himself had been a slave trader, and then became a Christian, and the two of them worked their entire life then to stop the slave trade.
[08:47:35.091 --> 08:47:35.812]  What we have now
[08:47:36.592 --> 08:47:43.074]  Is the free trade being put up before us, what they're trying to do in the name of free trade just like they did with the slave trade.
[08:47:43.094 --> 08:47:45.035]  TPP legalizes slavery again.
[08:47:45.615 --> 08:47:47.516]  Yeah, they want to make slaves out of all of us.
[08:47:47.776 --> 08:47:51.457]  So in every nation, in Britain, in America, the fight is going to look different.
[08:47:51.497 --> 08:47:53.798]  The new abolition movement against the new world order has begun.
[08:47:53.818 --> 08:47:59.300]  Yeah, and we have to understand that America is at the center of their plan.
[08:48:00.206 --> 08:48:03.969]  We are the spine on which they are hanging these economic agreements.
[08:48:04.249 --> 08:48:04.569]  That's right.
[08:48:04.589 --> 08:48:06.831]  The Rockefellers are building the whole thing on it.
[08:48:06.891 --> 08:48:08.812]  So what else is coming out in the Farage interview?
[08:48:09.492 --> 08:48:16.357]  Well, we also talk about the pollsters and how they tried to discourage people in Britain from going to the polls.
[08:48:16.837 --> 08:48:17.357]  That's right.
[08:48:17.478 --> 08:48:20.099]  In fact, the polls showed that Brexit was going to lose, but it won.
[08:48:20.700 --> 08:48:20.880]  Yeah.
[08:48:21.420 --> 08:48:27.024]  Even that morning, saying we've taken a poll and Brexit is losing by 10 points.
[08:48:27.751 --> 08:48:30.192]  We have to remember, they're going to continue to lie.
[08:48:30.252 --> 08:48:31.233]  Nigel Farage.
[08:48:31.693 --> 08:48:32.793]  Nigel Farage.
[08:48:33.173 --> 08:48:34.374]  They told us we were going to lose.
[08:48:34.654 --> 08:48:38.616]  All right, David, we'll pop back in with you more during the debate and after tonight.
[08:48:38.656 --> 08:48:39.276]  Live coverage.
[08:48:39.556 --> 08:48:40.116]  Great job.
[08:48:40.296 --> 08:48:43.358]  You guys continue to do your man on the street interviews there and much more.
[08:48:43.418 --> 08:48:44.378]  David Knight, thank you so much.
[08:48:45.279 --> 08:48:45.779]  Thank you, Alex.
[08:48:46.159 --> 08:48:46.359]  Wow.
[08:48:46.999 --> 08:48:50.341]  So, ladies and gentlemen, we are now only 12 minutes out from the debate.
[08:48:50.601 --> 08:48:52.322]  They usually start these three, four minutes
[08:48:53.800 --> 08:48:54.040]  Late?
[08:48:54.681 --> 08:48:56.122]  We have our own feed there on the ground.
[08:48:56.162 --> 08:48:56.923]  We have RightSide.
[08:48:56.963 --> 08:48:59.745]  We've got C-SPAN here behind us as you can see.
[08:49:00.426 --> 08:49:06.391]  Obviously, if you don't want any commentary, I'm going to have limited commentary during the 90-minute debate, but I'll analyze some of the propaganda during pauses.
[08:49:06.411 --> 08:49:07.852]  You can always go to InfoWars.com.
[08:49:07.872 --> 08:49:10.854]  We have other feeds like RightSide with no commentary linked there for you.
[08:49:11.215 --> 08:49:13.456]  If you want it with commentary, it's going to be here.
[08:49:13.496 --> 08:49:19.501]  That's how I used to carry the debates in the past when they were not open to the public and where you couldn't go get feeds.
[08:49:20.612 --> 08:49:23.933]  By saying we're giving commentary and open analysis under fair use.
[08:49:23.973 --> 08:49:27.354]  But I will continue that tradition tonight, but as limited as I can.
[08:49:28.055 --> 08:49:33.256]  We were just a week and a half ago or so, five minutes into the debate, and I was screaming, Trump, attack, attack, my God, why don't you attack?
[08:49:33.516 --> 08:49:37.398]  He finally did, he devastated her, and the word is he's taking the gloves off tonight.
[08:49:38.510 --> 08:49:39.371]  It's Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[08:49:57.561 --> 08:50:01.023]  And you cut taxes, you get more receipts, the debt gets paid down, there's more money.
[08:50:01.263 --> 08:50:03.804]  But the globalists want us to be dependent.
[08:50:04.004 --> 08:50:06.905]  We've got the WikiLeaks where they admit this plan.
[08:50:07.285 --> 08:50:08.366]  That's what's so frustrating.
[08:50:10.180 --> 08:50:14.661]  Is that they're making us poor artificially to control us and dictate the terms of our surrender.
[08:50:14.741 --> 08:50:16.462]  This is what globalism is.
[08:50:16.482 --> 08:50:19.502]  So we're going to have that and then at least an hour and a half, maybe two hours.
[08:50:19.542 --> 08:50:22.683]  Actually, I'm told it's two hours plus because we're doing 13 hours.
[08:50:22.703 --> 08:50:23.043]  That's right.
[08:50:23.063 --> 08:50:23.943]  So this will go till midnight.
[08:50:23.963 --> 08:50:25.084]  We started out at 11 a.m.
[08:50:25.444 --> 08:50:29.565]  We'll have 13 hours for 13 colonies of coverage, two hours of live coverage.
[08:50:30.205 --> 08:50:31.265]  We'll open the phones up.
[08:50:31.346 --> 08:50:33.647]  We had 23,000 calls last week, a week and a half ago.
[08:50:33.667 --> 08:50:39.989]  Because we have a computer now that monitors, it's not just a regular phone line, it's digital.
[08:50:40.009 --> 08:50:40.510]  23,000 plus calls.
[08:50:40.530 --> 08:50:40.890]  We took about 100.
[08:50:41.190 --> 08:50:42.791]  So those were powerful calls.
[08:50:42.811 --> 08:50:51.294]  We're going to have Joe Biggs, Darren McBreen, Rob Dew, Leanne McAdoo, Margaret Howell, Kit Daniels, whoever else wants to pop in, our amazing crew.
[08:50:51.574 --> 08:50:52.155]  They'll be here.
[08:50:52.235 --> 08:50:56.036]  I'll be here a little bit as well, but I kind of dominate things, so if I'm here, I'll be taking over.
[08:50:56.757 --> 08:50:58.938]  We've got the debate commission president up there.
[08:50:59.935 --> 08:51:00.335]  Right now.
[08:51:18.320 --> 08:51:20.542]  Because that's something that's obviously viral.
[08:51:20.602 --> 08:51:25.285]  And my God, last time I checked it was 400,000 viewers just on that feed.
[08:51:25.906 --> 08:51:30.589]  So that is definitely a big deal there.
[08:51:31.109 --> 08:51:31.850]  So check it out.
[08:51:31.890 --> 08:51:35.092]  We've got our feed, the YouTube feed, the Facebook feed, Right Side's feed.
[08:51:35.132 --> 08:51:38.895]  If you don't want to hear my commentary, I don't care who you get it from, as long as it's independent media.
[08:51:39.355 --> 08:51:40.316]  Infowars.com.
[08:51:40.356 --> 08:51:41.337]  And we now have punched up.
[08:51:41.737 --> 08:51:43.819]  I see we have the right side feed in front of me.
[08:51:43.859 --> 08:51:46.762]  Let's go to the debate commissioner here for just a moment to see the warm-up.
[08:51:46.842 --> 08:51:47.963]  Nine minutes out right now.
[08:51:48.323 --> 08:51:49.664]  Let's fade up the debate commissioner.
[08:51:49.945 --> 08:51:52.447]  Again, be activist, folks, to bring down the honest remedious.
[08:51:52.567 --> 08:51:56.811]  Send this link via email, call friends and family, Facebook, Twitter, you name it.
[08:51:57.031 --> 08:51:59.233]  Post our link, Infowars.com forward slash show.
[08:51:59.513 --> 08:52:01.375]  Now let's go and hear what the commission has to say.
[08:52:02.090 --> 08:52:03.511]  It's a pleasure to be with all of you tonight.
[08:52:03.531 --> 08:52:06.432]  I want to tell you a little bit about the Commission on Presidential Debates.
[08:52:06.712 --> 08:52:10.895]  It is important to note it is a non-partisan organization, non-profit.
[08:52:11.575 --> 08:52:17.518]  We don't receive any support from the government, from the political parties, or from any public entities.
[08:52:18.198 --> 08:52:21.180]  The support for the debates comes from people who just... We've studied this.
[08:52:21.220 --> 08:52:25.162]  This Commission hasn't been as bad as some, but I'm normally wanting to get third parties in.
[08:52:25.222 --> 08:52:28.404]  This time, the Libertarians got taken over by the Democrats.
[08:52:29.449 --> 08:52:31.870]  And then Jill Stein's good, but not getting any attention.
[08:52:31.910 --> 08:52:32.870]  The liberals have ignored her.
[08:52:32.890 --> 08:52:35.431]  And by good, I mean she's real, she's honest.
[08:52:35.451 --> 08:52:37.172]  She says, Hillary wants World War III.
[08:52:37.212 --> 08:52:38.672]  Don't support Hillary.
[08:52:38.692 --> 08:52:39.913]  If you're not going to vote for me, vote for Trump.
[08:52:40.113 --> 08:52:41.493]  She doesn't want to kill her family.
[08:52:41.773 --> 08:52:42.414]  She's smart.
[08:52:43.434 --> 08:52:48.796]  But when they say they're independent, the damn Republican-Democratic parties make up the commissioners on the commission.
[08:52:49.356 --> 08:52:51.537]  There's not a Libertarian or a Green Party on that commission.
[08:52:51.557 --> 08:52:52.717]  So that's not true.
[08:52:53.017 --> 08:52:53.978]  So that's why we're analyzing it.
[08:52:53.998 --> 08:52:54.578]  Let's go back to it.
[08:52:56.161 --> 08:52:56.802]  Oh, yay!
[08:52:57.042 --> 08:53:01.204]  Now, in addition to that, the Commission participates in a lot of educational work.
[08:53:01.224 --> 08:53:07.709]  The primary mission of the Commission is to help educate the American people about the choices that we make as citizens when we vote.
[08:53:08.149 --> 08:53:11.491]  So we have a number of programs that we work, a number of partnerships.
[08:53:12.012 --> 08:53:17.515]  In the last two years, we've especially concentrated on social media because of changes in the media itself.
[08:53:17.615 --> 08:53:25.060]  The importance of the Internet, social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Google, other .com entities.
[08:53:26.041 --> 08:53:30.603]  I mean, this guy is here talking about their stupid commission, to hijack the debates.
[08:53:31.343 --> 08:53:37.086]  The candidates ought to agree on public debates that are happening for two, three, four hours, and just battle each other.
[08:53:37.346 --> 08:53:39.347]  You get two minutes, you get two minutes, you get two minutes.
[08:53:39.807 --> 08:53:41.368]  Okay, like the Lincoln-Douglas, okay?
[08:53:41.728 --> 08:53:50.412]  These are not debates where you got some fact-checker where the mainstream media is like, God, why don't we just elect then, you know, these so-called reporters?
[08:53:51.192 --> 08:53:56.836]  Like Anderson Cooper or like, you know, the NBC guy that literally screwed the pooch in front of everybody.
[08:53:57.176 --> 08:53:57.676]  Lester Holt.
[08:53:57.976 --> 08:53:59.938]  I mean, or Rat Lady, whatever her name is.
[08:54:00.138 --> 08:54:08.803]  I mean, why don't we just have them as our presidents or prime ministers or leaders if they're the fact checker, fact totem that tells us we're hearing the truth?
[08:54:08.863 --> 08:54:10.144]  This is a load of bull.
[08:54:10.344 --> 08:54:12.286]  We didn't have fact checkers until 2012.
[08:54:12.606 --> 08:54:18.750]  What the hell did Mitt Romney let Candy Crowley in, who got caught lying about everything?
[08:54:20.660 --> 08:54:26.966]  I mean, there's no end to the arrogance, the bravado, the chutzpah, whatever you want to call this crap.
[08:54:27.858 --> 08:54:30.440]  But I didn't mean to go out of the commission here, but that's why we're analyzing it.
[08:54:30.480 --> 08:54:32.101]  I mean, this is just a load of horse manure.
[08:54:32.642 --> 08:54:33.742]  We're non-partisan?
[08:54:33.822 --> 08:54:35.103]  What the hell does that mean?
[08:54:35.424 --> 08:54:36.805]  We're not affiliated with a political party?
[08:54:36.905 --> 08:54:38.946]  You're run by party hacks!
[08:54:39.286 --> 08:54:40.787]  Half are Republican, half are Democrats!
[08:54:41.168 --> 08:54:42.269]  This is what you do!
[08:54:42.709 --> 08:54:43.549]  Stop lying!
[08:54:44.130 --> 08:54:45.431]  Obamacare is not free!
[08:54:45.491 --> 08:54:46.892]  You are coming after our guns!
[08:54:47.112 --> 08:54:48.313]  There is a world government!
[08:54:48.493 --> 08:54:50.254]  Our government is funding radical Islam!
[08:54:50.975 --> 08:54:51.856]  We are in trouble!
[08:54:52.556 --> 08:54:53.337]  By the way, briefly,
[08:54:54.462 --> 08:54:55.386]  We're going to carry this pretty much.
[08:54:56.008 --> 08:54:59.924]  Well, it's going to be commercial-free, but I'm going to be giving limited analysis at fullwords.com forward slash show.
[08:55:01.431 --> 08:55:02.512]  They're coming after the media.
[08:55:02.552 --> 08:55:03.252]  They've said it.
[08:55:03.292 --> 08:55:13.179]  They have deadlock in the Federal Elections Commission and the FCC to restrict the internet, restrict talk radio, because the old dinosaur media cannot survive.
[08:55:13.199 --> 08:55:13.659]  They're dying.
[08:55:13.679 --> 08:55:15.040]  In fact, most of them are already gone.
[08:55:15.660 --> 08:55:17.902]  There's still a few dinosaurs, like crocodiles and alligators are.
[08:55:18.262 --> 08:55:21.504]  Basically, the crocodilia family is even older than the dinosaurs.
[08:55:21.524 --> 08:55:25.406]  So technically, there are creatures around that, you know, were dinosaurs.
[08:55:25.426 --> 08:55:28.949]  But for all intents and purposes, the main kingdom of dinosaurs is already extinct.
[08:55:29.369 --> 08:55:30.029]  Look at these mummies.
[08:55:30.069 --> 08:55:37.031]  I'm not against old people, but I mean, this is who thinks they control us and have a few big wigs up that nobody's even watching, you know, right now to hear all this crap.
[08:55:37.671 --> 08:55:40.212]  And so, they're coming after you and your choices.
[08:55:40.632 --> 08:55:44.173]  They handed the internet over to the UN 19 days ago.
[08:55:44.253 --> 08:55:45.013]  I mean, they're coming.
[08:55:45.633 --> 08:55:46.193]  We know this.
[08:55:46.233 --> 08:55:47.414]  So, spread the word.
[08:55:48.534 --> 08:55:52.735]  Grow the new independent true media, the patriot media, the pro-
[08:55:53.672 --> 08:55:57.074]  Liberty Media, the pro-prosperity media, in their face.
[08:55:57.615 --> 08:55:58.735]  And believe me, the world is hungry.
[08:55:58.956 --> 08:55:59.876]  The world knows the truth.
[08:56:00.176 --> 08:56:01.097]  The world knows what's happening.
[08:56:01.117 --> 08:56:02.638]  And you fund operations like this.
[08:56:02.838 --> 08:56:04.719]  We have free shipping at InfoWareStore.com right now.
[08:56:05.260 --> 08:56:08.502]  We have 25% off on the game-changing nootropic I'm on right now, Brain Force.
[08:56:08.742 --> 08:56:10.303]  Some of the compounds are under prescription in Europe.
[08:56:10.623 --> 08:56:17.088]  We've got a new Trump is my President shirt that's red, so you can wear it, you know, out on election day to show your numbers.
[08:56:17.348 --> 08:56:18.108]  Or just wear a red shirt.
[08:56:18.128 --> 08:56:19.409]  Everybody's doing that, but we have that.
[08:56:19.829 --> 08:56:20.930]  We have the Hillary for President shirt.
[08:56:20.950 --> 08:56:23.232]  Look at all the memes you've coined by supporting us.
[08:56:24.272 --> 08:56:25.613]  That's $9.95 right now.
[08:56:25.673 --> 08:56:26.853]  Free shipping, everything in the store.
[08:56:27.233 --> 08:56:29.874]  Infowarsstore.com and support the tip of the spear.
[08:56:30.014 --> 08:56:31.214]  Money is what it takes to fund this.
[08:56:31.474 --> 08:56:38.296]  It's why I support Right Side, why I support Breitbart, why I support Drudge, why I support all these other small, medium, gigantic organizations that fight for liberty.
[08:56:38.576 --> 08:56:42.778]  Because we don't hang together, we'll all hang separate.
[08:56:42.798 --> 08:56:46.519]  Here, let's hear who this guy is up there that they've got before the debate commission.
[08:56:46.539 --> 08:56:46.939]  Here he is.
[08:56:49.494 --> 08:56:50.134]  Thank you.
[08:56:51.015 --> 08:57:03.582]  And just the day before that, on Monday, the governor was on campus, Governor Sandoval, signing into law the new stadium that the university will be able to use and a much expanded and renovated convention center for Rossi as well.
[08:57:03.602 --> 08:57:05.643]  So it's quite a week for UNLV.
[08:57:06.203 --> 08:57:08.124]  And then tonight, the presidential debate.
[08:57:08.284 --> 08:57:13.027]  And I'll tell you what's the most special for us about the debate is what this does for our students.
[08:57:13.487 --> 08:57:15.609]  We've got a few hundred students that have no future.
[08:57:16.009 --> 08:57:19.412]  90% of the jobs have been totally worthless.
[08:57:19.432 --> 08:57:22.795]  Go pay $100,000, $200,000 for your degree, it's worthless.
[08:57:22.915 --> 08:57:24.896]  Or crap.
[08:57:25.337 --> 08:57:27.198]  Who are these people?
[08:57:27.238 --> 08:57:28.659]  By the way, people think I'm mean.
[08:57:28.680 --> 08:57:29.780]  Listen, I'm not.
[08:57:30.061 --> 08:57:35.305]  The globalists know this is a predatory system that's anti-human, and it counts on your confidence in it.
[08:57:35.745 --> 08:57:40.910]  I'm confident in Americana, and I'm confident in free market, and I'm confident in low taxes.
[08:57:41.570 --> 08:57:45.493]  They've written the whole tax law to have some of the highest taxes in the world to screw us.
[08:57:45.553 --> 08:57:46.033]  And I'm done!
[08:57:46.053 --> 08:57:51.097]  And I don't need any more candy asses up on TV telling me how great something is.
[08:57:51.457 --> 08:57:57.081]  It's time to break through the decorum and being calm and being nice and going along with the system.
[08:57:57.301 --> 08:57:58.161]  That's why we're screwed.
[08:57:58.342 --> 08:57:59.663]  We're here to break the trance.
[08:58:00.003 --> 08:58:01.364]  Get people out of their comfort zone.
[08:58:01.784 --> 08:58:02.785]  Restore the Republic.
[08:58:03.365 --> 08:58:05.106]  Hillary is openly getting ready to steal the election.
[08:58:05.126 --> 08:58:06.007]  They're federalizing it.
[08:58:06.627 --> 08:58:10.049]  They've got videos all over the country of the Democrats bragging they're already getting people to vote.
[08:58:10.310 --> 08:58:11.590]  Early voting ten times apiece.
[08:58:12.011 --> 08:58:13.792]  Project Veritas up on Infowars.com.
[08:58:14.092 --> 08:58:14.592]  I'm angry.
[08:58:15.513 --> 08:58:16.534]  And I'm not putting up with it.
[08:58:16.554 --> 08:58:17.795]  They've tried to rig the whole thing.
[08:58:18.055 --> 08:58:19.416]  And this is a referendum against it.
[08:58:19.696 --> 08:58:21.477]  But we have only begun to fight.
[08:58:21.717 --> 08:58:22.398]  Make no mistake.
[08:58:23.098 --> 08:58:24.279]  Now let's see what this guy's got to say.
[08:58:24.299 --> 08:58:25.420]  Thank you for all of that.
[08:58:25.760 --> 08:58:28.402]  Las Vegas is the only city that evolved to host people.
[08:58:28.562 --> 08:58:30.244]  We've been doing that for many, many years.
[08:58:30.944 --> 08:58:33.606]  And we continue to refine what we do and go to the next level.
[08:58:34.147 --> 08:58:44.274]  Last year, we attracted more than 42 million visitors, who generated $50 billion of economic impact for Las Vegas and created 336,000 jobs.
[08:58:44.294 --> 08:58:48.458]  So that's very important for the health of our city, the state, and also the country.
[08:58:49.078 --> 08:58:52.361]  And the special events, we are the special events capital of the world.
[08:58:53.041 --> 08:58:55.105]  And we have all types of events here.
[08:58:55.165 --> 08:58:56.889]  The networks aren't covering it for two minutes.
[08:58:57.430 --> 08:58:59.734]  But these guys want to be on the alternative media, so they are.
[08:59:00.135 --> 08:59:01.337]  You're seeing some behind the scenes.
[08:59:01.377 --> 08:59:03.541]  And he's just trying to get jobs in Vegas, whatever.
[08:59:05.097 --> 08:59:09.480]  You know, my biggest problem with Trump is he's involved in the casinos, but I get that's part of hotels and golf courses.
[08:59:09.540 --> 08:59:12.061]  So, he's not out to get the country, he wants prosperity.
[08:59:12.221 --> 08:59:13.602]  He's like an hospitality type guy.
[08:59:14.203 --> 08:59:16.404]  So I can turn, you know, turn a blind eye to that.
[08:59:16.444 --> 08:59:19.986]  I'm not a lesser to evils guy, it's just that the globalists are out to get us.
[08:59:20.387 --> 08:59:24.089]  They hate Trump because he knows America's being given a one-sided deal.
[08:59:26.428 --> 08:59:27.248]  And I'm not a hypocrite.
[08:59:27.408 --> 08:59:28.308]  You know, I'm not a gambler.
[08:59:28.388 --> 08:59:30.049]  I've been to Vegas doing TV shows and stuff.
[08:59:30.429 --> 08:59:32.269]  I've gone and played slot machines and played blackjack, you know.
[08:59:32.289 --> 08:59:33.989]  So I'm not going to sit there and piss on Trump over that.
[08:59:34.170 --> 08:59:37.730]  Just like if he'd have been a hypocrite over, you know, women and stuff, I would be mad.
[08:59:37.750 --> 08:59:39.010]  Like, I'm this holier-than-thou guy.
[08:59:39.030 --> 08:59:39.671]  But he wasn't.
[08:59:40.271 --> 08:59:42.591]  And then Hillary, meanwhile, is a thousand times worse.
[08:59:43.551 --> 08:59:44.572]  That's why I'm so concerned.
[08:59:45.032 --> 08:59:46.252]  We're 30 seconds out.
[08:59:46.352 --> 08:59:47.212]  Spread the word.
[08:59:47.272 --> 08:59:48.232]  Be part of the info war.
[08:59:48.272 --> 08:59:49.673]  It's having a huge effect.
[08:59:49.693 --> 08:59:50.533]  Hillary's attacking us.
[08:59:50.613 --> 08:59:50.973]  Obama.
[08:59:50.993 --> 08:59:51.693]  We're shaking him up.
[08:59:52.619 --> 08:59:53.680]  We're 15 seconds out.
[08:59:54.481 --> 08:59:58.365]  InfoWars.com forward slash show for our feed and a bunch of other feeds.
[08:59:58.905 --> 08:59:59.766]  You don't want me chomping in?
[08:59:59.786 --> 09:00:00.707]  We got feeds on the site.
[09:00:00.727 --> 09:00:05.612]  All right, let's go to the Republican establishment guy watching tonight.
[09:00:05.652 --> 09:00:06.232]  Be quiet.
[09:00:06.272 --> 09:00:14.400]  Let me, as a show of hands, how many of you have been to a general election debate between the two presidential nominees?
[09:00:14.440 --> 09:00:15.101]  Raise your hands.
[09:00:16.104 --> 09:00:16.364]  Wow.
[09:00:17.024 --> 09:00:20.586]  Okay, so you know the drill, and those of you who don't, I'm going to repeat the drill.
[09:00:20.666 --> 09:00:23.427]  The drill is you can cheer for Hillary, not for Trump.
[09:00:23.447 --> 09:00:26.449]  There's going to be two against one, right?
[09:00:26.949 --> 09:00:28.109]  People would hoot and holler.
[09:00:28.250 --> 09:00:30.050]  Fox is in the bag for Hillary.
[09:00:30.170 --> 09:00:31.451]  But this is different.
[09:00:31.651 --> 09:00:32.712]  One of these two people
[09:00:33.752 --> 09:00:37.457]  Three weeks from yesterday is going to be the next President of the United States.
[09:00:37.657 --> 09:00:40.881]  It's very important for them to be able to make their case.
[09:00:41.061 --> 09:00:47.328]  It's very important for the millions of people who are going to be watching out there to be able to listen to them make their case.
[09:00:49.551 --> 09:00:54.756]  You're going to hear your candidate say something absolutely wonderful, and you're going to want to cheer.
[09:00:55.216 --> 09:00:55.496]  Don't.
[09:00:56.017 --> 09:01:02.723]  I'm sure in the course of the next hour and a half, you're going to hear the other person, the other candidate, say something that you don't like.
[09:01:02.783 --> 09:01:03.863]  You want to make some noise?
[09:01:04.204 --> 09:01:04.504]  Don't.
[09:01:05.065 --> 09:01:07.587]  Just remember, you're not a participant here.
[09:01:07.927 --> 09:01:10.108]  The problem is conservatives follow rules, liberals don't.
[09:01:10.128 --> 09:01:10.448]  So, cheer!
[09:01:10.488 --> 09:01:13.209]  Isn't it cool to have a clean seat?
[09:01:13.229 --> 09:01:14.589]  Look, no network feeds on that.
[09:01:14.629 --> 09:01:16.050]  See what we give you folks?
[09:01:35.433 --> 09:01:36.173]  No network feed.
[09:01:36.873 --> 09:01:37.594]  This is our feed.
[09:01:38.534 --> 09:01:38.834]  Right now.
[09:01:39.134 --> 09:01:39.734]  InfoWars.com.
[09:01:39.754 --> 09:01:40.555]  This is what we're building.
[09:01:41.135 --> 09:01:42.755]  We're going to go next level this year, folks.
[09:01:43.035 --> 09:01:43.476]  And next year.
[09:01:44.676 --> 09:01:46.516]  Hundreds of TV stations are already starting to pick it up.
[09:01:46.576 --> 09:01:47.097]  It's huge.
[09:01:47.437 --> 09:01:49.337]  Because people now know the InfoWars was right.
[09:01:49.737 --> 09:01:50.698]  Oh, look at Bill!
[09:01:51.258 --> 09:01:52.238]  How you doing there, buddy?
[09:01:52.298 --> 09:01:54.239]  I'm a friendly guy.
[09:01:54.339 --> 09:01:55.519]  What a piece of trash.
[09:01:56.379 --> 09:01:57.400]  These people are such criminals.
[09:01:58.203 --> 09:01:59.403]  They've sold us out so bad.
[09:01:59.443 --> 09:02:00.644]  I mean, get mad at them!
[09:02:00.684 --> 09:02:01.544]  Stop submitting!
[09:02:02.024 --> 09:02:03.185]  My God, look at WikiLeaks!
[09:02:03.725 --> 09:02:07.566]  Now, the mainstream media won't cover it, but it talks about Trump and some 11-year-old potty talk.
[09:02:07.967 --> 09:02:11.228]  And by the way, the author of some book 15 years ago recorded a bunch of stuff with Trump, too.
[09:02:11.748 --> 09:02:12.308]  Out of context.
[09:02:12.328 --> 09:02:12.888]  Get ready for it.
[09:02:13.028 --> 09:02:14.149]  No, it's the establishment.
[09:02:14.429 --> 09:02:14.869]  So what?
[09:02:16.710 --> 09:02:17.470]  I'm out with my buddies.
[09:02:17.550 --> 09:02:20.811]  If you take me, you might... I mean, not stuff Trump's saying, but stuff like it.
[09:02:20.851 --> 09:02:21.672]  I mean, nobody's perfect.
[09:02:22.492 --> 09:02:24.593]  Difference is, we're not stealing the Haitian money.
[09:02:25.452 --> 09:02:27.133]  The difference is we're not trying to start war with Russia.
[09:02:27.153 --> 09:02:30.134]  The difference is we're not up here on something holier-than-thou deal.
[09:02:30.174 --> 09:02:34.416]  I mean, I'm ashamed of myself sometimes, but if I stub my toe, I say GD.
[09:02:34.536 --> 09:02:35.036]  I don't want to.
[09:02:35.116 --> 09:02:35.797]  I repent to God.
[09:02:35.837 --> 09:02:36.597]  God knows I love him.
[09:02:37.157 --> 09:02:40.158]  But the point is Trump's an outsider.
[09:02:40.459 --> 09:02:42.059]  The whole power structure's against him.
[09:02:42.279 --> 09:02:43.320]  This is so obvious.
[09:02:44.838 --> 09:02:47.480]  They always start three, four, five minutes into it now.
[09:02:47.521 --> 09:02:50.383]  That way the networks get their ads, get their promos, get all their stuff.
[09:02:50.403 --> 09:02:51.544]  But the networks are a joke.
[09:02:51.604 --> 09:02:54.147]  The average network out there is going to have a couple million viewers.
[09:02:54.187 --> 09:02:55.788]  The Fox is going to have 30, 40, 50 million.
[09:02:55.989 --> 09:02:56.629]  I hope more than that.
[09:02:56.689 --> 09:03:04.196]  But here we are with millions, over two and a half million right now, tuning in one way or another just on the streams I can look at at InfoWars.com.
[09:03:04.637 --> 09:03:05.257]  That's what I'm saying.
[09:03:05.337 --> 09:03:06.518]  Facebook, Twitter, everywhere.
[09:03:06.759 --> 09:03:07.900]  So then after the debate,
[09:03:08.340 --> 09:03:20.894]  People can hear our analysis, hear about the TPP, hear about the New World Order, hear about Hillary's executive order she's planning in WikiLeaks to ban the guns, to appoint five to four Supreme Court justices, to try to steal the election.
[09:03:21.555 --> 09:03:23.377]  All of it is at Infowars.com.
[09:03:23.437 --> 09:03:24.157]  We're covering it.
[09:03:24.818 --> 09:03:28.859]  DrugsReport.com, Breitbart.com, WND.com, DeadlyCaller.com.
[09:03:29.159 --> 09:03:30.480]  Is Deadly Caller as hardcore as they are?
[09:03:30.520 --> 09:03:33.921]  No, but they're pro-gun, pro-free market, and they're not out to screw the country.
[09:03:34.601 --> 09:03:35.562]  Is Breitbart as hardcore?
[09:03:35.602 --> 09:03:36.282]  They're starting to be.
[09:03:36.362 --> 09:03:39.203]  I'm very proud of the fact that we're moving the Overton window.
[09:03:39.263 --> 09:03:41.404]  We've radicalized everyone, as the White House admits.
[09:03:41.724 --> 09:03:44.004]  Yeah, you're radically trying to take our guns, set up world government.
[09:03:44.465 --> 09:03:45.645]  We're going to radically fight your ass.
[09:03:45.685 --> 09:03:46.365]  I'm not a radical.
[09:03:47.646 --> 09:03:49.066]  I'm about as straight-laced as it gets.
[09:03:49.686 --> 09:03:54.168]  But you start trying to take my freedoms away, I'm going to come after you.
[09:03:55.470 --> 09:04:01.755]  So, so much is coming out, and I'm not a big government promoter, but I gotta tell you, on average, it's been people in government that have been exposing this stuff.
[09:04:01.775 --> 09:04:02.435]  It's not the Russians.
[09:04:03.096 --> 09:04:03.496]  D.C.
[09:04:03.516 --> 09:04:04.036]  leaks all of it.
[09:04:04.056 --> 09:04:04.997]  It's right out of our own government.
[09:04:05.057 --> 09:04:09.260]  Patriots that know what's happening, like Mr. Snowden, that are exposing what's going on.
[09:04:10.141 --> 09:04:14.404]  And so, are we natural allies with Russia against radical Islam that surrounds Russia?
[09:04:14.444 --> 09:04:15.085]  Even worse than us?
[09:04:15.105 --> 09:04:16.205]  10 times, 20 times worse?
[09:04:17.226 --> 09:04:20.048]  Are we natural allies with the U.K.
[09:04:20.088 --> 09:04:20.769]  pulling out of the Euro?
[09:04:22.617 --> 09:04:24.779]  Are we natural allies to want to have prosperity?
[09:04:24.799 --> 09:04:26.080]  I don't care where you're from in the world.
[09:04:26.440 --> 09:04:27.201]  You want to come here?
[09:04:27.581 --> 09:04:28.402]  You want to work hard?
[09:04:28.462 --> 09:04:29.463]  You want to be an American?
[09:04:29.503 --> 09:04:33.107]  You want to go to shooting ranges and own property and be productive?
[09:04:33.287 --> 09:04:35.469]  Man, I don't care what color you are, I love you.
[09:04:36.911 --> 09:04:42.496]  You want to be some bitchy person thinking you got screwed over and come to America and say you didn't get something free?
[09:04:42.676 --> 09:04:43.758]  Well then why the hell did you come here?
[09:04:44.557 --> 09:04:47.700]  I've got all the George Soros emails when they want to create race war and division in this country.
[09:04:48.360 --> 09:04:50.602]  That evil Nazi collaborator needs to be brought to justice.
[09:04:51.303 --> 09:04:51.843]  I'm Alex Jones.
[09:04:51.883 --> 09:04:53.825]  This is live coverage of the 2016 final debate.
[09:04:54.785 --> 09:04:58.609]  Good evening from the Thomas and Mack Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
[09:04:58.629 --> 09:04:59.189]  Final showdown.
[09:04:59.349 --> 09:04:59.809]  Spread the word.
[09:04:59.830 --> 09:05:00.130]  Here we are.
[09:05:00.170 --> 09:05:01.871]  I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News.
[09:05:02.312 --> 09:05:10.818]  And I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.
[09:05:11.559 --> 09:05:14.681]  This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
[09:05:15.121 --> 09:05:17.062]  The Commission has designed the format.
[09:05:17.503 --> 09:05:25.427]  Six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment.
[09:05:25.967 --> 09:05:28.369]  Both campaigns have agreed to those rules.
[09:05:28.609 --> 09:05:33.152]  For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic
[09:05:33.792 --> 09:05:37.638]  None of those questions has been shared with the Commission or the two candidates.
[09:05:37.678 --> 09:05:38.299]  Bravo, Sierra.
[09:05:38.319 --> 09:05:40.843]  The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent.
[09:05:40.883 --> 09:05:47.693]  No cheers, boos, or other interruptions, and you can focus on what the candidates have to say.
[09:05:48.536 --> 09:05:56.722]  No noise except right now, as we welcome the Democratic nominee for President, Secretary of State, the Republican nominee for President, Mr. Trump.
[09:06:15.259 --> 09:06:17.488]  Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, welcome.
[09:06:17.689 --> 09:06:18.632]  Let's get right to it.
[09:06:18.673 --> 09:06:20.781]  The first topic is the Supreme Court.
[09:06:22.458 --> 09:06:41.288]  You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely, or possibly, two or three appointments, which means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century.
[09:06:41.368 --> 09:06:45.310]  First of all, where do you want to see the court take the country?
[09:06:45.350 --> 09:06:45.970]  Back to the Constitution.
[09:06:46.010 --> 09:06:50.973]  And secondly, what's your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted?
[09:06:51.893 --> 09:07:00.961]  Do the founders' words mean what they say, or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances?
[09:07:01.462 --> 09:07:03.884]  In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first.
[09:07:03.924 --> 09:07:04.624]  You have two minutes.
[09:07:04.744 --> 09:07:08.388]  Thank you very much, Chris, and thanks to UNLV for hosting us.
[09:07:09.108 --> 09:07:15.113]  You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election.
[09:07:15.894 --> 09:07:18.616]  Namely, what kind of country are we going to be?
[09:07:18.636 --> 09:07:22.258]  What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens?
[09:07:22.378 --> 09:07:25.420]  What kind of rights will Americans have?
[09:07:26.180 --> 09:07:37.147]  And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.
[09:07:37.927 --> 09:08:03.232]  For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into
[09:08:04.274 --> 09:08:08.163]  She runs the foundation, dark, unaccountable money, what the hell?
[09:08:13.032 --> 09:08:35.045]  But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say the Supreme Court should represent
[09:08:35.445 --> 09:08:35.866]  All of us.
[09:08:36.006 --> 09:08:51.267]  And the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.
[09:08:51.988 --> 09:08:54.269]  And I look forward to having that opportunity.
[09:08:54.449 --> 09:09:01.172]  I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them.
[09:09:01.192 --> 09:09:04.833]  That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.
[09:09:05.213 --> 09:09:09.995]  The President nominates and then the Senate advises and confirms or not.
[09:09:10.055 --> 09:09:12.396]  But they go forward with the process.
[09:09:13.016 --> 09:09:14.377]  Secretary Clinton, thank you.
[09:09:14.477 --> 09:09:15.778]  Mr. Trump, same question.
[09:09:15.798 --> 09:09:21.580]  Where do you want to see the court take the country and how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?
[09:09:22.648 --> 09:09:25.829]  Well, first of all, it's great to be with you and thank you, everybody.
[09:09:25.849 --> 09:09:27.850]  The Supreme Court, it's what it's all about.
[09:09:28.110 --> 09:09:34.493]  Our country is so, so, just so imperative that we have the right justices.
[09:09:34.733 --> 09:09:46.819]  Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent.
[09:09:47.780 --> 09:09:51.045]  And she was forced to apologize and apologize she did.
[09:09:51.645 --> 09:09:54.309]  But these were statements that should never ever have been made.
[09:09:54.790 --> 09:10:03.742]  We need a Supreme Court that, in my opinion, is going to uphold the Second Amendment and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege.
[09:10:04.803 --> 09:10:16.869]  I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.
[09:10:17.469 --> 09:10:24.933]  But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold because of the fact that it is under such trauma.
[09:10:25.733 --> 09:10:30.955]  I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint, and I've named 20 of them,
[09:10:32.296 --> 09:10:36.098]  The justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life.
[09:10:36.319 --> 09:10:38.040]  They will have a conservative bent.
[09:10:38.840 --> 09:10:40.861]  They will be protecting the Second Amendment.
[09:10:41.322 --> 09:10:45.704]  They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect.
[09:10:46.625 --> 09:10:52.629]  They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.
[09:10:53.269 --> 09:10:55.891]  And I believe that's very, very important.
[09:10:55.931 --> 09:11:00.774]  I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear.
[09:11:01.514 --> 09:11:04.155]  It's all about the Constitution.
[09:11:05.936 --> 09:11:11.299]  And so important, the Constitution, the way it was meant to be.
[09:11:11.639 --> 09:11:14.441]  And those are the people that I will appoint.
[09:11:15.404 --> 09:11:16.305]  Mr. Trump, thank you.
[09:11:16.345 --> 09:11:18.627]  We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion.
[09:11:18.707 --> 09:11:28.916]  I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name, could end up changing the existing law of the land.
[09:11:29.076 --> 09:11:31.898]  First is one that you mentioned, Mr. Trump, and that is guns.
[09:11:31.958 --> 09:11:36.722]  Secretary Clinton, you said last year, and let me quote, the Supreme Court is wrong.
[09:11:37.463 --> 09:11:38.364]  On the Second Amendment.
[09:11:38.404 --> 09:11:45.093]  Now, in fact, in the 2008... By the way, folks, my audio crew is analyzing the feed.
[09:11:45.114 --> 09:11:47.036]  Trump has half the audio Hillary does.
[09:11:47.056 --> 09:11:48.398]  They do that to make him sound weak.
[09:11:48.418 --> 09:11:50.160]  They turn it down where he sounds lispy.
[09:11:50.981 --> 09:11:52.003]  It's what's not personable.
[09:11:52.043 --> 09:11:53.805]  This is a psychological warfare tactic.
[09:11:54.406 --> 09:11:54.866]  Go back to it.
[09:11:54.906 --> 09:11:55.807]  We've caught them.
[09:11:55.827 --> 09:11:56.668]  We have the feeds, though.
[09:11:56.688 --> 09:11:57.748]  We have the computers.
[09:11:57.768 --> 09:12:00.590]  I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years.
[09:12:00.610 --> 09:12:02.812]  I represent upstate New York.
[09:12:03.032 --> 09:12:06.695]  I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.
[09:12:06.775 --> 09:12:08.756]  It goes back to the founding of our country.
[09:12:08.816 --> 09:12:10.657]  You want a ban, you liar?
[09:12:10.697 --> 09:12:13.179]  It's in the WikiLeaks, you freaking lying whore!
[09:12:14.620 --> 09:12:24.073]  Um, because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.
[09:12:24.153 --> 09:12:27.077]  And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die
[09:12:30.862 --> 09:12:32.744]  Just let me make you my slave.
[09:12:32.764 --> 09:12:34.305]  I have come to enslave America.
[09:12:53.423 --> 09:12:55.345]  My name is Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[09:12:55.625 --> 09:12:57.986]  Give me the firearms and I will keep you safe.
[09:12:58.507 --> 09:13:02.229]  I want the guns, not so I can dominate you, but so I can be your friend.
[09:13:02.249 --> 09:13:03.010]  Give me your guns, I love you.
[09:13:12.396 --> 09:13:14.497]  Sorry, I said I'd shut up, didn't I?
[09:13:14.517 --> 09:13:16.938]  We have feeds without me on Infowars.com.
[09:13:34.471 --> 09:13:37.512]  How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected?
[09:13:37.552 --> 09:13:39.992]  You just heard Secretary Clinton's answer.
[09:13:40.593 --> 09:13:46.934]  Does she persuade you that while you may disagree on regulation, that in fact she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms?
[09:13:47.234 --> 09:13:48.174]  Well, the D.C.
[09:13:48.214 --> 09:13:53.436]  v. Heller decision was very strongly, and she was extremely angry about it.
[09:13:53.496 --> 09:13:53.996]  I watched.
[09:13:54.016 --> 09:13:56.577]  I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld.
[09:13:56.657 --> 09:14:02.118]  And Justice Scalia was so involved, and it was a well-crafted decision.
[09:14:02.718 --> 09:14:12.186]  But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry, and people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.
[09:14:12.286 --> 09:14:13.988]  Let me bring in Secretary Clinton.
[09:14:14.008 --> 09:14:15.169]  Were you extremely upset?
[09:14:15.569 --> 09:14:19.833]  Well, I was upset because unfortunately dozens of toddlers
[09:14:20.333 --> 09:14:26.156]  Unfortunately, dozens of toddlers who were unable to abort did not get sent off to the meat factory.
[09:14:26.296 --> 09:14:29.777]  Unfortunately, I have bodyguards and I want your gun slave.
[09:14:29.817 --> 09:14:30.778]  I'm an elitist.
[09:14:30.838 --> 09:14:31.538]  I hate black people.
[09:14:31.558 --> 09:14:31.998]  That's what she says.
[09:14:32.018 --> 09:14:32.299]  I'll tell you.
[09:14:32.319 --> 09:14:38.922]  There's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms.
[09:14:39.662 --> 09:14:44.163]  That is not in conflict with sensible, common sense regulation.
[09:14:44.183 --> 09:14:47.724]  You want our guns like I told Piers Morgan!
[09:14:47.984 --> 09:14:48.784]  Stop lying!
[09:14:48.824 --> 09:14:50.304]  We have your damn emails!
[09:14:50.344 --> 09:14:53.665]  The gun lobby's on his side, they're running millions of dollars of ads against me.
[09:14:53.705 --> 09:14:54.625]  The gun lobby, blah blah blah.
[09:14:54.765 --> 09:14:55.626]  The only thing we got left.
[09:14:55.666 --> 09:15:01.707]  Because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say, of course we're going to protect and defend the 2nd Amendment.
[09:15:01.727 --> 09:15:03.367]  But we're going to do it in a way that
[09:15:05.808 --> 09:15:07.890]  Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this.
[09:15:07.910 --> 09:15:08.551]  12,000 are suicide.
[09:15:08.831 --> 09:15:09.652]  Assault weapons.
[09:15:09.672 --> 09:15:11.354]  That means ban semi-auto.
[09:15:11.394 --> 09:15:12.555]  Here's the Fox weasel.
[09:15:24.167 --> 09:15:35.184]  Well let me just tell you, before we go any further, in Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.
[09:15:35.625 --> 09:15:38.910]  So we have the toughest laws and you have tremendous gun violence.
[09:15:39.771 --> 09:15:53.999]  I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment, and I am, I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA, and it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president.
[09:15:54.019 --> 09:15:55.720]  So I'm very honored by all of that.
[09:15:56.740 --> 09:15:59.382]  We are going to appoint justices.
[09:15:59.463 --> 09:16:01.784]  This is the best way to help the Second Amendment.
[09:16:01.824 --> 09:16:09.991]  We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.
[09:16:10.071 --> 09:16:10.291]  Yes.
[09:16:10.331 --> 09:16:22.321]  Well, let's pick up on another issue which divides you, and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that's the issue of abortion.
[09:16:22.921 --> 09:16:36.906]  Mr. Trump, you're pro-life, but I want to ask you specifically, do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes, in fact states, a woman's right to abortion?
[09:16:37.026 --> 09:16:44.569]  Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.
[09:16:45.009 --> 09:16:48.872]  But I'm asking you specifically, would you like to... If they overturned it, it'll go back to the states.
[09:16:49.052 --> 09:16:52.755]  But what I'm asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn?
[09:16:52.775 --> 09:16:55.597]  You just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment.
[09:16:55.697 --> 09:16:57.999]  Do you want to see the court overturn really quick?
[09:16:58.019 --> 09:17:04.124]  Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that's really what's going to be... that will happen.
[09:17:04.664 --> 09:17:10.149]  And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life... Stop using abortion as contraception!
[09:17:10.649 --> 09:17:11.369]  I will say this.
[09:17:11.409 --> 09:17:13.590]  The case is a medical right, whatever, but just stop it!
[09:17:13.610 --> 09:17:15.311]  And the states will then make a determination.
[09:17:15.351 --> 09:17:16.591]  It curses us to kill our kids, folks!
[09:17:16.631 --> 09:17:17.051]  It's a damn curse!
[09:17:17.071 --> 09:17:29.595]  I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which is a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about health care that one can imagine.
[09:17:30.416 --> 09:17:33.417]  And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.
[09:17:34.017 --> 09:17:36.758]  It is about what's happening right now in America.
[09:17:36.898 --> 09:17:38.238]  So many states are putting
[09:17:40.499 --> 09:17:46.805]  Very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice.
[09:17:46.845 --> 09:17:51.970]  To the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which of course provides all the benefits for
[09:17:56.093 --> 09:17:58.055]  I don't judge women for abortions, ladies.
[09:17:58.075 --> 09:17:58.475]  You're not.
[09:17:58.535 --> 09:17:59.235]  If you did, it's okay.
[09:17:59.255 --> 09:18:00.296]  The point is, the agenda is death.
[09:18:00.316 --> 09:18:01.416]  This was the birth control league of...
[09:18:11.462 --> 09:18:11.562]  Nazis.
[09:18:11.582 --> 09:18:12.583]  What about punishment for China?
[09:18:33.780 --> 09:18:36.702]  ...or how far you believe the right to abortion goes.
[09:18:36.742 --> 09:18:41.825]  You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional right.
[09:18:41.845 --> 09:18:43.266]  Peter Singer was up to age three.
[09:18:43.667 --> 09:18:47.469]  ...voted against a ban on late-term partial birth.
[09:18:47.509 --> 09:18:48.650]  He's been first so far, folks.
[09:18:48.670 --> 09:18:48.750]  Why?
[09:18:48.790 --> 09:18:49.851]  I gotta give it to him.
[09:18:49.951 --> 09:18:53.013]  Because Roe v. Wade very clearly said... I gotta stop talking now.
[09:18:53.393 --> 09:19:03.140]  ...that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.
[09:19:04.020 --> 09:19:08.383]  And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.
[09:19:09.124 --> 09:19:18.571]  The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make.
[09:19:18.751 --> 09:19:24.956]  I have met with women who, toward the end of their pregnancy, get the worst news one could get.
[09:19:24.976 --> 09:19:29.239]  That their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry the term.
[09:19:29.679 --> 09:19:32.962]  Or that something terrible should happen or just been discovered.
[09:19:33.742 --> 09:19:35.043]  Uh, about the pregnancy.
[09:19:35.543 --> 09:19:42.128]  I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.
[09:19:42.548 --> 09:19:49.733]  So, you can regulate, if you are doing so, with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.
[09:19:49.773 --> 09:19:53.276]  Mr. Trump, your reaction, and particularly on this issue of late-term partial birth.
[09:19:53.316 --> 09:19:54.677]  Well, I think it's terrible.
[09:19:54.977 --> 09:20:06.246]  If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother, just prior to the birth of the baby.
[09:20:06.306 --> 09:20:06.806]  But it's racist.
[09:20:06.846 --> 09:20:13.532]  Now, you can say that that's okay, and Hillary can say that that's okay, but it's not okay with me.
[09:20:14.252 --> 09:20:23.506]  Because based on what she's saying and based on where she's going and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month.
[09:20:24.406 --> 09:20:25.206]  On the final day.
[09:20:44.856 --> 09:20:49.900]  I do not believe the government should be making it.
[09:20:50.240 --> 09:20:54.223]  I have the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country.
[09:20:54.323 --> 09:21:03.789]  I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions like they used to do in China, or forced women to birth their children.
[09:21:03.890 --> 09:21:06.972]  And I can tell you the government has no business
[09:21:07.652 --> 09:21:15.775]  In the decisions that women make with their families, in accordance with their faith, with medical advice, and I will stand up for that right.
[09:21:16.235 --> 09:21:16.475]  All right.
[09:21:16.815 --> 09:21:18.595]  Eleven's pushing on child policy here.
[09:21:18.635 --> 09:21:27.938]  Honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.
[09:21:28.398 --> 09:21:29.179]  Nobody has that right.
[09:21:29.259 --> 09:21:29.899]  Ten thousand plus a year.
[09:21:29.919 --> 09:21:30.219]  Let's move on.
[09:21:30.819 --> 09:21:32.300]  To the subject of immigration.
[09:21:32.801 --> 09:21:37.645]  And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration.
[09:21:37.705 --> 09:21:40.947]  Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you.
[09:21:41.608 --> 09:21:45.031]  Obama has lawlessly opened the border.
[09:21:45.091 --> 09:21:46.352]  This is globalism.
[09:21:46.392 --> 09:21:46.752]  The U.N.
[09:21:46.772 --> 09:21:48.053]  Mexico has a wall.
[09:21:48.474 --> 09:21:51.156]  Mr. Trump, you are calling for major deportations.
[09:21:51.616 --> 09:21:59.403]  Secretary Clinton, you say that within your first hundred days as president, you're going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship.
[09:22:00.163 --> 09:22:03.427]  Uh, the question really is, why are you right and your opponent wrong?
[09:22:04.028 --> 09:22:05.550]  Mr. Trump, you go first in this segment.
[09:22:05.570 --> 09:22:06.191]  You have two minutes.
[09:22:06.271 --> 09:22:12.339]  Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting in line for many, many years.
[09:22:12.859 --> 09:22:14.101]  We need strong borders.
[09:22:14.702 --> 09:22:17.625]  In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of
[09:22:18.667 --> 09:22:27.117]  I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed, by people that came into the country illegally.
[09:22:27.497 --> 09:22:31.942]  You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.
[09:22:32.563 --> 09:22:34.025]  They're coming in illegally.
[09:22:34.105 --> 09:22:35.787]  Drugs are pouring in through the border.
[09:22:35.987 --> 09:22:38.049]  We have no country if we have no border.
[09:22:38.369 --> 09:22:39.891]  Hillary wants to give amnesty.
[09:22:39.951 --> 09:22:41.432]  She wants to have open borders.
[09:22:41.852 --> 09:22:48.339]  The border secure, as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500 plus ICE last week, endorsed me.
[09:22:48.379 --> 09:22:50.300]  First time they've ever endorsed a candidate.
[09:22:51.141 --> 09:22:52.561]  It means their job is tougher.
[09:22:53.001 --> 09:22:54.322]  But they know what's going on.
[09:22:54.502 --> 09:22:55.862]  They know it better than anybody.
[09:22:56.022 --> 09:22:58.082]  They want strong borders.
[09:22:58.162 --> 09:22:59.742]  They feel we have to have strong borders.
[09:23:00.083 --> 09:23:01.643]  I was up in New Hampshire the other day.
[09:23:01.723 --> 09:23:14.805]  The biggest complaint they have, with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama, all of the problems, their single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.
[09:23:14.825 --> 09:23:16.605]  It's just pouring and destroying their youth.
[09:23:16.685 --> 09:23:19.706]  It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.
[09:23:20.726 --> 09:23:23.168]  We have to have strong borders.
[09:23:23.529 --> 09:23:25.551]  We have to keep the drugs out of our country.
[09:23:25.711 --> 09:23:28.593]  We are, right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.
[09:23:29.094 --> 09:23:30.315]  We need strong borders.
[09:23:30.795 --> 09:23:33.538]  We need absolute, we cannot give amnesty.
[09:23:34.078 --> 09:23:35.820]  Now, I want to build the wall.
[09:23:36.300 --> 09:23:36.940]  We need the wall.
[09:23:37.381 --> 09:23:39.982]  The Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall.
[09:23:40.562 --> 09:23:41.482]  We stop the drugs.
[09:23:41.642 --> 09:23:43.003]  We shore up the border.
[09:23:43.483 --> 09:23:47.205]  One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones.
[09:23:47.245 --> 09:23:50.807]  We have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.
[09:23:51.347 --> 09:23:52.247]  We're going to get them out.
[09:23:52.307 --> 09:23:53.808]  We're going to secure the border.
[09:23:54.168 --> 09:23:58.390]  And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest.
[09:23:58.930 --> 09:24:02.052]  But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.
[09:24:03.066 --> 09:24:04.107]  Mr. Trump, thank you.
[09:24:04.487 --> 09:24:06.468]  Same question to you, Secretary Clinton.
[09:24:06.788 --> 09:24:09.389]  Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?
[09:24:09.770 --> 09:24:23.637]  Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who was very worried that her parents might be deported because she was born in this country, but they were not.
[09:24:24.057 --> 09:24:26.939]  They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.
[09:24:27.839 --> 09:24:28.640]  And you're right.
[09:24:28.820 --> 09:24:30.401]  I don't want to rip families apart.
[09:24:30.862 --> 09:24:33.704]  I don't want to be sending parents away from children.
[09:24:34.284 --> 09:24:41.350]  I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.
[09:24:41.690 --> 09:24:44.072]  We have 11 million undocumented people.
[09:24:44.112 --> 09:24:46.674]  They have 4 million American citizen children.
[09:24:47.535 --> 09:24:48.596]  15 million people.
[09:24:49.016 --> 09:24:55.701]  He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.
[09:24:55.721 --> 09:24:56.682]  Now here's what that means.
[09:24:57.142 --> 09:25:10.632]  It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented.
[09:25:11.432 --> 09:25:16.699]  And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses, to get them out of our country.
[09:25:17.360 --> 09:25:23.107]  I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation.
[09:25:23.587 --> 09:25:26.731]  I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.
[09:25:27.492 --> 09:25:30.014]  I have been for border security for years.
[09:25:30.174 --> 09:25:32.956]  I voted for border security in the United States Senate.
[09:25:33.336 --> 09:25:38.039]  And my comprehensive immigration reform plan, of course, includes border security.
[09:25:38.580 --> 09:25:42.282]  But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed.
[09:25:42.402 --> 09:25:49.026]  Getting rid of any violent person, anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.
[09:25:49.587 --> 09:25:57.012]  When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president, didn't even raise it, he choked.
[09:25:57.552 --> 09:26:01.796]  And then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.
[09:26:02.296 --> 09:26:15.849]  So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly and that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first hundred days with a path to citizenship.
[09:26:16.249 --> 09:26:17.470]  Thank you, Secretary Clinton.
[09:26:17.490 --> 09:26:18.470]  I want to follow up.
[09:26:18.570 --> 09:26:21.472]  I think I should respond to that.
[09:26:21.492 --> 09:26:24.254]  First of all, I had a very good meeting with the President of Mexico.
[09:26:24.374 --> 09:26:25.214]  Very nice man.
[09:26:26.215 --> 09:26:29.997]  We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals, believe me.
[09:26:30.677 --> 09:26:35.400]  The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody.
[09:26:35.960 --> 09:26:36.721]  It's a disaster.
[09:26:37.001 --> 09:26:38.562]  Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.
[09:26:39.142 --> 09:26:41.183]  Hillary Clinton fought for the wall.
[09:26:41.464 --> 09:26:41.644]  She did?
[09:26:41.664 --> 09:26:42.184]  In 2006, or thereabouts.
[09:26:44.676 --> 09:26:48.838]  Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built.
[09:26:49.518 --> 09:26:51.859]  But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.
[09:26:52.620 --> 09:26:54.300]  We are a country of laws.
[09:26:54.500 --> 09:26:56.461]  There he goes interrupting.
[09:26:56.501 --> 09:27:00.263]  I'd like to hear from Secretary Clinton.
[09:27:00.343 --> 09:27:04.285]  I voted for border security.
[09:27:04.725 --> 09:27:07.826]  There are some limited places where that was appropriate.
[09:27:07.866 --> 09:27:12.388]  There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.
[09:27:12.428 --> 09:27:13.389]  No, they just got rid of the wall.
[09:27:14.051 --> 09:27:17.433]  It is clear when you look at what Donald has been proposing.
[09:27:17.473 --> 09:27:22.356]  He started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals.
[09:27:22.376 --> 09:27:22.656]  No he didn't.
[09:27:22.816 --> 09:27:26.618]  He said we gotta send criminals that come in back that are criminals.
[09:27:26.878 --> 09:27:28.159]  Which is admitted.
[09:27:28.439 --> 09:27:30.240]  Mexico gives you a visa lady?
[09:27:30.640 --> 09:27:32.821]  What I am also arguing is that bringing
[09:27:34.329 --> 09:27:42.152]  Undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good because then employers can't exploit them.
[09:27:42.172 --> 09:27:45.833]  The Democrats always want to keep the illegals under control.
[09:27:45.873 --> 09:27:48.674]  He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.
[09:27:49.054 --> 09:27:54.896]  He underpaid undocumented workers and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do.
[09:27:55.196 --> 09:27:56.957]  You complain, I'll get you deported.
[09:27:57.437 --> 09:28:03.779]  I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald Trump exploit them.
[09:28:03.959 --> 09:28:06.640]  She's a little dirty pig that worked for Saul Alinsky, who... God!
[09:28:06.720 --> 09:28:09.120]  By the way, I have a breaking news on thefortwars.com.
[09:28:25.325 --> 09:28:28.386]  Danny Williams attempted to meet Bill Clinton today at the debate.
[09:28:28.467 --> 09:28:29.727]  He was unable to.
[09:28:29.747 --> 09:28:31.148]  CNN had him kicked out of the hotel.
[09:28:31.168 --> 09:28:31.648]  Let's go back.
[09:28:31.668 --> 09:28:33.549]  I go to Cancun and I gotta get out when they say six days.
[09:28:40.492 --> 09:28:41.873]  That's what he said a year and a half ago.
[09:28:57.308 --> 09:29:02.732]  ...is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.
[09:29:02.752 --> 09:29:06.615]  Secretary Clinton, I want to... We will not have open borders.
[09:29:06.675 --> 09:29:09.697]  That is a... We already have them, you lion's goblin!
[09:29:09.717 --> 09:29:13.960]  We will have secure borders, but we will also have reform.
[09:29:14.060 --> 09:29:15.801]  And this used to be a bipartisan issue.
[09:29:16.061 --> 09:29:22.266]  Ronald Reagan was the last president to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it as well.
[09:29:22.466 --> 09:29:40.876]  Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank for which you were paid $225,000, we've learned from the WikiLeaks that you said this, and I want to quote, my dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.
[09:29:40.936 --> 09:29:42.257]  So, that's the question.
[09:29:44.594 --> 09:29:45.275]  That's the question.
[09:29:45.295 --> 09:29:46.275]  Please quiet, everybody.
[09:29:46.876 --> 09:29:47.896]  Is that good for you?
[09:29:47.996 --> 09:29:48.637]  Open borders.
[09:29:48.737 --> 09:29:53.560]  Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy.
[09:29:53.841 --> 09:29:59.565]  You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined.
[09:29:59.705 --> 09:30:05.989]  And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders.
[09:30:06.369 --> 09:30:08.171]  I think that would be a great benefit to us.
[09:30:08.971 --> 09:30:21.901]  But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks, and what's really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans.
[09:30:21.961 --> 09:30:22.721]  Total lie!
[09:30:22.741 --> 09:30:23.922]  They're not behind most of it.
[09:30:25.303 --> 09:30:36.672]  Uh, websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions, then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the internet.
[09:30:36.692 --> 09:30:37.252]  Did Jay Johnson say so?
[09:30:37.272 --> 09:30:49.001]  This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly from Putin himself, in an effort... So all your crimes are okay... ...as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed to influence our election.
[09:30:49.281 --> 09:30:53.004]  So I actually think the most important question of this meeting is... What about Soros?
[09:30:53.604 --> 09:30:54.266]  In our election.
[09:30:54.427 --> 09:30:55.951]  Finally, will Donald Trump...
[09:30:56.838 --> 09:31:13.944]  Admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this, and make it clear that we will not have the help of Putin in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past.
[09:31:14.404 --> 09:31:16.004]  Those are the questions we need answered.
[09:31:16.024 --> 09:31:19.586]  We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.
[09:31:19.626 --> 09:31:23.607]  That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, okay?
[09:31:24.187 --> 09:31:25.348]  How did we get onto Putin?
[09:31:25.688 --> 09:31:26.828]  Hold on, hold on.
[09:31:26.868 --> 09:31:27.408]  No, no.
[09:31:27.448 --> 09:31:27.749]  Wait, wait.
[09:31:27.909 --> 09:31:31.170]  Hold on folks, because this is going to end up getting out of control.
[09:31:31.210 --> 09:31:35.052]  Let's try to keep it quiet for the candidates and for the American people.
[09:31:35.132 --> 09:31:36.532]  Just to finish on the borders.
[09:31:36.692 --> 09:31:36.892]  Yes.
[09:31:37.232 --> 09:31:38.613]  She wants open borders.
[09:31:38.973 --> 09:31:40.834]  People are going to pour into our country.
[09:31:41.134 --> 09:31:42.935]  People are going to come in from Syria.
[09:31:43.315 --> 09:31:45.136]  She wants 550% more people than Barack Obama.
[09:31:48.337 --> 09:31:49.638]  Anchor babies, everything free.
[09:32:10.018 --> 09:32:14.961]  If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.
[09:32:15.421 --> 09:32:17.042]  He has no respect for her.
[09:32:17.062 --> 09:32:19.403]  He has no respect for our president.
[09:32:19.923 --> 09:32:21.964]  And I'll tell you what, we're in very serious trouble.
[09:32:22.425 --> 09:32:32.810]  Because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads, 1,800 by the way, where they expanded and we didn't.
[09:32:32.830 --> 09:32:35.491]  1,800 nuclear warheads, and she's playing chicken.
[09:32:37.011 --> 09:32:42.673]  Putin, from everything I see, has no respect for this person.
[09:32:42.774 --> 09:32:46.235]  Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as President of the United States.
[09:32:46.295 --> 09:32:48.476]  No, because you're a dangerous piece of film!
[09:32:48.536 --> 09:32:57.040]  It's pretty clear that you won't admit that the Russians have engaged in cyber attacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged
[09:32:57.600 --> 09:32:59.061]  You're the foreign major, lady!
[09:32:59.101 --> 09:33:00.703]  You're the enemy!
[09:33:01.163 --> 09:33:05.987]  ...that you are willing to spout the Putin line... Spout the Putin line!
[09:33:06.007 --> 09:33:07.128]  We got your emails!
[09:33:07.148 --> 09:33:09.170]  You work for the Chinese, lady!
[09:33:09.731 --> 09:33:17.838]  ...and that you continue to get help from him because he has a very clear favorite in this race.
[09:33:18.198 --> 09:33:22.742]  So, I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.
[09:33:22.782 --> 09:33:23.623]  We've never had
[09:33:24.003 --> 09:33:26.824]  No, you said Soros and the globalists and foreign banks.
[09:33:26.864 --> 09:33:27.364]  No, they haven't.
[09:33:27.424 --> 09:33:28.665]  No, the army came out and said it's not.
[09:33:39.588 --> 09:33:44.390]  The highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election.
[09:33:44.830 --> 09:33:46.731]  I find that deeply disturbing.
[09:33:46.791 --> 09:33:49.973]  Russia knows the globals want war, they're trying to stop it, just like we are.
[09:33:50.013 --> 09:33:53.354]  Whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else, she has no idea.
[09:33:53.474 --> 09:34:00.298]  I am not quoting myself, I am quoting 17 intelligence... Do you doubt 17 military and civilian agencies?
[09:34:00.318 --> 09:34:02.879]  The agencies that say you work with the Muslims?
[09:34:02.899 --> 09:34:03.219]  I doubt it.
[09:34:03.339 --> 09:34:04.420]  Want us to arrest you?
[09:34:18.929 --> 09:34:25.093]  Putin has smarted her, he's near her, he's smarted her every step of the way.
[09:34:25.233 --> 09:34:26.133]  Wallace won't let him talk.
[09:34:26.213 --> 09:34:28.575]  And I would like to ask you this direct question.
[09:34:29.055 --> 09:34:34.378]  The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks.
[09:34:34.398 --> 09:34:35.679]  And Clapper said the NSA is a spy.
[09:34:35.699 --> 09:34:42.643]  Even if you don't know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election?
[09:34:42.723 --> 09:34:44.504]  By Russia or anybody else?
[09:34:44.744 --> 09:34:46.025]  You condemn their interference?
[09:34:46.145 --> 09:34:47.065]  Of course I condemn.
[09:34:47.125 --> 09:34:47.745]  Of course I can.
[09:34:47.845 --> 09:34:48.586]  I don't know Putin.
[09:34:49.126 --> 09:34:50.307]  I have no idea.
[09:34:50.347 --> 09:34:51.447]  I never met Putin.
[09:34:51.527 --> 09:34:52.828]  This is not my best friend.
[09:34:53.168 --> 09:34:56.549]  But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad.
[09:34:56.890 --> 09:35:02.092]  Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way.
[09:35:02.312 --> 09:35:05.033]  Whether it's Syria, you name it, missiles.
[09:35:05.754 --> 09:35:08.495]  Take a look at the startup that they signed.
[09:35:09.195 --> 09:35:12.457]  The Russians have said, according to many, many reports,
[09:35:13.237 --> 09:35:15.038]  I can't believe they allowed us to do this.
[09:35:15.478 --> 09:35:17.538]  They create warheads and we can't.
[09:35:17.899 --> 09:35:19.079]  The Russians can't believe it.
[09:35:19.439 --> 09:35:24.041]  She has been outsmarted by Putin and all you have to do is look at the Middle East.
[09:35:24.121 --> 09:35:25.761]  We've spent six trillion dollars.
[09:35:26.201 --> 09:35:27.442]  They've taken over the Middle East.
[09:35:28.002 --> 09:35:33.924]  She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government.
[09:35:33.944 --> 09:35:38.225]  You're a long way away from their immigration, but I'm going to let you finish this.
[09:35:39.066 --> 09:35:39.906]  You got 45 seconds.
[09:35:39.966 --> 09:35:40.746]  And she always will be.
[09:35:42.967 --> 09:35:47.008]  I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons.
[09:35:47.088 --> 09:35:52.990]  This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual, about the use of nuclear weapons.
[09:35:53.050 --> 09:35:55.551]  He's advocated more countries getting them.
[09:35:55.631 --> 09:35:57.831]  Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.
[09:35:58.412 --> 09:36:00.832]  He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them?
[09:36:00.852 --> 09:36:02.653]  Which I think is terrifying.
[09:36:02.693 --> 09:36:03.773]  But here's the deal.
[09:36:03.793 --> 09:36:09.695]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must
[09:36:09.895 --> 09:36:12.137]  Japan's got over 500 strike bombers underground.
[09:36:12.157 --> 09:36:18.162]  It's about 4 minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching the nuclear weapons.
[09:36:18.182 --> 09:36:19.022]  Isn't Japan Mr. Warfare?
[09:36:19.042 --> 09:36:19.943]  Doesn't it have a secret army?
[09:36:20.183 --> 09:36:33.034]  And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and in an unprecedented way said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear codes.
[09:36:33.054 --> 09:36:37.197]  They've got 500 Japanese pilots loaded just right now to blow John off the map.
[09:36:39.518 --> 09:36:41.719]  21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients.
[09:36:42.379 --> 09:36:48.641]  As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the world.
[09:36:48.661 --> 09:36:49.941]  We're defending other countries.
[09:36:50.301 --> 09:36:52.122]  We are spending a fortune doing it.
[09:36:52.442 --> 09:36:54.022]  They have the bargain of the century.
[09:36:54.582 --> 09:37:03.825]  All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places.
[09:37:03.845 --> 09:37:04.705]  We are supposed to make secret.
[09:37:04.725 --> 09:37:07.106]  Japan is allowed a secret force to strike China.
[09:37:07.586 --> 09:37:08.207]  Nuclear weapons.
[09:37:08.227 --> 09:37:10.248]  They're a thousand mile bomber range.
[09:37:10.428 --> 09:37:13.290]  She's been proven to be a liar in so many different ways.
[09:37:13.670 --> 09:37:15.291]  This is just another lie.
[09:37:16.092 --> 09:37:17.393]  Well, I'm just quoting you.
[09:37:17.413 --> 09:37:19.694]  The check against China is just your name.
[09:37:19.714 --> 09:37:21.596]  Japan is a giant army right now.
[09:37:21.796 --> 09:37:26.279]  Nuclear competition in Asia, you said.
[09:37:26.719 --> 09:37:27.220]  Missile crisis.
[09:37:27.240 --> 09:37:28.741]  Go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks.
[09:37:29.757 --> 09:37:33.638]  I told you this all year ago, you had weapons 10 years ago.
[09:37:33.658 --> 09:37:36.198]  I didn't say nuclear, and defend yourself.
[09:37:36.298 --> 09:37:40.059]  The United States has kept the peace through our alliances.
[09:37:40.859 --> 09:37:42.540]  Donald wants to tear up our alliances.
[09:37:42.560 --> 09:37:47.661]  No, you destabled Iraq, you destabled Syria, you destabled Libya, you destabled Egypt.
[09:37:47.681 --> 09:37:49.321]  You're a liar!
[09:37:49.401 --> 09:37:50.242]  You're a liar!
[09:37:50.302 --> 09:37:51.522]  It's all lies!
[09:37:51.622 --> 09:37:53.322]  Like Obamacare being free!
[09:37:53.462 --> 09:37:56.383]  We are going to move on to the next topic.
[09:37:57.256 --> 09:38:01.017]  Which is the economy, and I hope we handled that as well as we did immigration.
[09:38:01.037 --> 09:38:01.777]  He's giving her more time.
[09:38:02.237 --> 09:38:03.277]  That little son of a bitch.
[09:38:03.337 --> 09:38:07.518]  You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster.
[09:38:07.558 --> 09:38:11.959]  Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role.
[09:38:12.499 --> 09:38:19.121]  You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties.
[09:38:19.981 --> 09:38:24.186]  Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation.
[09:38:24.486 --> 09:38:35.938]  We're going to drill down into this a little bit more, but in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent's plan will not.
[09:38:36.338 --> 09:38:38.080]  In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton.
[09:38:38.080 --> 09:38:41.242]  Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives.
[09:38:41.322 --> 09:38:48.187]  And so, my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle class families many more opportunities.
[09:38:48.207 --> 09:38:49.788]  Their whole plan is to declassify and destroy us.
[09:38:49.808 --> 09:38:55.912]  I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing.
[09:38:56.152 --> 09:38:59.534]  I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should.
[09:39:00.115 --> 09:39:03.337]  New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change.
[09:39:03.757 --> 09:39:06.379]  Deal to her friends, boondoggles.
[09:39:06.399 --> 09:39:07.820]  Shut down your job, give it to them.
[09:39:07.840 --> 09:39:08.260]  That's a scam.
[09:39:08.300 --> 09:39:09.901]  I want us to do more to help small business.
[09:39:09.921 --> 09:39:12.603]  That's where two-thirds of the new jobs are going to come from.
[09:39:12.623 --> 09:39:16.846]  I want us to raise the national minimum wage because... You got a job!
[09:39:16.966 --> 09:39:18.527]  You didn't build that!
[09:39:18.907 --> 09:39:21.068]  Somebody else did that for you!
[09:39:21.148 --> 09:39:24.411]  And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.
[09:39:25.411 --> 09:39:30.834]  I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts in preschool and goes through college.
[09:39:31.115 --> 09:39:35.137]  That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges.
[09:39:35.217 --> 09:39:39.039]  Real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future.
[09:39:39.540 --> 09:39:43.002]  I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000.
[09:39:43.042 --> 09:39:45.943]  Does Trump get any time here or is it all just this witch?
[09:39:45.983 --> 09:39:50.406]  Wallace isn't really being nasty and interrupting, but he's letting her talk the whole time.
[09:39:50.446 --> 09:39:53.088]  When the time comes out tonight, she's gotten 30% more.
[09:39:53.848 --> 09:39:55.049]  We're going to have corporations
[09:40:09.384 --> 09:40:09.724]  I don't
[09:40:29.100 --> 09:40:32.382]  No, they already are offshore, sweetheart.
[09:40:32.842 --> 09:40:34.863]  That's why they're against me.
[09:40:34.903 --> 09:40:38.725]  They don't want the general public to get a leg up.
[09:40:38.765 --> 09:40:39.965]  They want a monopoly.
[09:40:39.985 --> 09:40:41.406]  They want me not cutting in.
[09:40:41.446 --> 09:40:45.828]  We have feeds and infowars.com free of this analysis, but I'm not sitting there all this witch-lies.
[09:40:45.848 --> 09:40:47.028]  There was no Benghazi stand down.
[09:40:54.972 --> 09:40:55.912]  Secretary, thank you.
[09:40:55.932 --> 09:41:01.033]  Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton?
[09:41:01.133 --> 09:41:06.294]  Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes.
[09:41:06.394 --> 09:41:08.574]  Her tax plan is a disaster.
[09:41:08.955 --> 09:41:11.475]  And she can say all she wants about college tuition.
[09:41:11.715 --> 09:41:13.775]  By the way, on the weekly show, she went bankrupt.
[09:41:13.795 --> 09:41:17.796]  A lot of costly college tuition, but the rest of the country is going to be paying for it.
[09:41:17.836 --> 09:41:21.977]  We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan.
[09:41:22.892 --> 09:41:24.493]  But I'd like to start off where we left.
[09:41:25.174 --> 09:41:33.440]  Because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries.
[09:41:34.280 --> 09:41:36.622]  Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.
[09:41:36.802 --> 09:41:38.143]  We protect Saudi Arabia.
[09:41:38.844 --> 09:41:39.784]  Why aren't they paying?
[09:41:39.884 --> 09:41:42.186]  She immediately, when she heard this, I questioned it.
[09:41:42.386 --> 09:41:43.267]  And I questioned NATO.
[09:41:43.287 --> 09:41:44.388]  Why aren't the NATO questioned?
[09:41:44.468 --> 09:41:45.228]  Why aren't they paying?
[09:41:45.469 --> 09:41:46.309]  Because they weren't paying.
[09:41:46.749 --> 09:41:48.291]  Since I did this, this was a year ago,
[09:41:48.991 --> 09:41:52.034]  All of a sudden they're paying, and I've been given a lot of credit for it.
[09:41:52.094 --> 09:41:53.636]  All of a sudden they're starting to pay up.
[09:41:53.696 --> 09:41:54.436]  They have to pay up.
[09:41:54.757 --> 09:41:56.458]  We're protecting people, they have to pay up.
[09:41:56.879 --> 09:41:59.441]  And I'm a big fan of NATO, but they have to pay up.
[09:41:59.681 --> 09:42:03.785]  She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great.
[09:42:03.825 --> 09:42:08.469]  Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying, we think how great they are.
[09:42:09.130 --> 09:42:16.875]  We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.
[09:42:16.895 --> 09:42:17.576]  We're going bankrupt!
[09:42:17.616 --> 09:42:17.836]  Pay up!
[09:42:18.376 --> 09:42:18.817]  Pay up!
[09:42:19.077 --> 09:42:19.717]  Exactly!
[09:42:19.757 --> 09:42:23.860]  During President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt.
[09:42:24.040 --> 09:42:26.502]  We're up to 20 trillion dollars.
[09:42:27.142 --> 09:42:29.024]  So my plan, we're going to renegotiate trade deals.
[09:42:29.044 --> 09:42:30.044]  We're going to have a lot of free trade.
[09:42:30.064 --> 09:42:32.086]  We're going to have more free trade than we have right now.
[09:42:32.586 --> 09:42:33.647]  But we have horrible deals.
[09:42:34.088 --> 09:42:38.393]  Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever.
[09:42:39.254 --> 09:42:41.256]  Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.
[09:42:41.696 --> 09:42:43.839]  You look at all of the places that I just left.
[09:42:43.919 --> 09:42:47.743]  You go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them.
[09:42:47.903 --> 09:42:49.004]  You go upstate New York.
[09:42:49.725 --> 09:42:52.007]  Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.
[09:42:52.087 --> 09:42:53.248]  We're bringing our jobs back.
[09:42:53.729 --> 09:42:55.290]  I am going to renegotiate NAFTA.
[09:42:55.591 --> 09:43:00.035]  And if I can't make a great deal, then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals.
[09:43:00.055 --> 09:43:00.816]  We're going to have trade.
[09:43:01.256 --> 09:43:03.038]  But we're going to terminate it.
[09:43:03.378 --> 09:43:05.260]  We're going to make a great trade deal.
[09:43:05.520 --> 09:43:10.045]  We're going to go a separate way because it has been a disaster.
[09:43:10.465 --> 09:43:12.167]  We're going to cut taxes massively.
[09:43:12.467 --> 09:43:14.569]  We're going to cut business taxes massively.
[09:43:14.890 --> 09:43:16.331]  They're going to start hiring people.
[09:43:16.612 --> 09:43:20.175]  We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion that's offshore back into the country.
[09:43:20.716 --> 09:43:25.881]  We are going to start the engine rolling again because right now our country is dying at 1% GDP.
[09:43:28.018 --> 09:43:31.499]  Well, let me translate that if I can, Chris, because... Let me translate that.
[09:43:31.519 --> 09:43:34.020]  Globalism was meant to kill America, and you don't get that, Trump.
[09:43:34.140 --> 09:43:35.400]  And we're going to finish the country.
[09:43:35.560 --> 09:43:36.501]  We're taking over.
[09:43:36.601 --> 09:43:38.041]  Hail George Soros!
[09:43:38.121 --> 09:43:40.062]  Let me translate that for you.
[09:43:40.082 --> 09:43:42.602]  I'm a piece of crap that steals furniture from the State Department.
[09:43:42.863 --> 09:43:48.584]  I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign, I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.
[09:43:48.604 --> 09:43:51.205]  That's what Obama said in life.
[09:43:51.265 --> 09:43:53.786]  I also will not add a penny to the debt.
[09:43:54.566 --> 09:43:56.647]  I have costed out what I'm going to do.
[09:43:56.787 --> 09:44:01.069]  He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.
[09:44:01.489 --> 09:44:02.590]  Well, he mentioned the debt.
[09:44:02.930 --> 09:44:04.750]  We know how to get control of the debt.
[09:44:04.770 --> 09:44:09.673]  When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion deficit.
[09:44:09.693 --> 09:44:11.133]  They created the derivatives.
[09:44:11.153 --> 09:44:12.474]  They created it all.
[09:44:12.594 --> 09:44:13.394]  What a liar.
[09:44:13.474 --> 09:44:15.315]  Obamacare is free too, did you hear?
[09:44:15.335 --> 09:44:15.695]  She told you!
[09:44:15.715 --> 09:44:16.716]  And there's no penalties either!
[09:44:20.037 --> 09:44:22.459]  He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.
[09:44:22.820 --> 09:44:29.266]  So yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people.
[09:44:29.626 --> 09:44:39.996]  So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead.
[09:44:40.356 --> 09:44:42.678]  That's the kind of approach that will work.
[09:44:42.698 --> 09:44:49.622]  Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we've tried that, but it has not worked the way that it has been done.
[09:44:49.642 --> 09:45:01.570]  Kirkland, I want to pursue your plan, because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949.
[09:45:01.610 --> 09:45:01.890]  Correct.
[09:45:06.380 --> 09:45:06.860]  Thank you, sir.
[09:45:07.681 --> 09:45:15.688]  You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn't get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus.
[09:45:15.708 --> 09:45:20.293]  So is your plan basically more, even more of the Obama stimulus?
[09:45:20.813 --> 09:45:22.334]  Well, it's a combination, Chris.
[09:45:22.395 --> 09:45:23.395]  And let me say that
[09:45:24.298 --> 09:45:34.604]  When you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation.
[09:45:34.764 --> 09:45:37.485]  I was in the Senate before I became Secretary of State.
[09:45:37.525 --> 09:45:47.551]  I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.
[09:45:48.248 --> 09:45:54.230]  I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.
[09:45:54.410 --> 09:45:58.892]  He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.
[09:45:59.332 --> 09:46:01.033]  But it was a terrible recession.
[09:46:01.513 --> 09:46:03.894]  So now we've dug ourselves out of it.
[09:46:04.154 --> 09:46:05.815]  We're standing, but we're not yet running.
[09:46:06.235 --> 09:46:11.337]  So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up.
[09:46:12.117 --> 09:46:13.237]  Not the top down.
[09:46:13.397 --> 09:46:14.838]  That is not going to work.
[09:46:15.258 --> 09:46:25.981]  That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher paying jobs.
[09:46:26.021 --> 09:46:33.583]  We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs.
[09:46:33.843 --> 09:46:39.545]  We've got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that's what I believe I will be able to do.
[09:46:39.825 --> 09:46:45.726]  Mr. Trump, even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don't add up.
[09:46:45.826 --> 09:46:54.648]  That your idea, and you've talked about 25 million jobs created, 4% growth, is unrealistic.
[09:46:55.748 --> 09:47:03.050]  And they say, you talk a lot about growing the energy industry, they say with oil prices as low as they are right now, that's unrealistic as well.
[09:47:03.370 --> 09:47:04.010]  Your responses?
[09:47:04.150 --> 09:47:07.492]  So I just left some high representatives of India.
[09:47:08.032 --> 09:47:08.713]  They're growing at 8%.
[09:47:10.394 --> 09:47:15.277]  China is growing at 7%, and that for them is a catastrophically low number.
[09:47:16.077 --> 09:47:21.801]  We are growing, our last report came out, and it's right around the 1% level, and I think it's going down.
[09:47:22.401 --> 09:47:29.345]  Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report, a terrible jobs report.
[09:47:29.365 --> 09:47:29.946]  In fact, I said,
[09:47:30.626 --> 09:47:32.988]  Is that the last jobs report before the election?
[09:47:33.109 --> 09:47:34.910]  Because if it is, I should win easily.
[09:47:35.191 --> 09:47:35.851]  It was so bad.
[09:47:36.432 --> 09:47:37.553]  The report was so bad.
[09:47:38.414 --> 09:47:41.076]  Look, our country is stagnant.
[09:47:41.677 --> 09:47:42.958]  We've lost our jobs.
[09:47:42.998 --> 09:47:44.379]  We've lost our businesses.
[09:47:44.900 --> 09:47:47.823]  We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking.
[09:47:48.510 --> 09:47:53.013]  Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.
[09:47:53.673 --> 09:47:55.414]  I've visited so many communities.
[09:47:55.434 --> 09:47:57.895]  This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris.
[09:47:58.456 --> 09:47:59.677]  I've gotten to know so many.
[09:47:59.737 --> 09:48:01.898]  I've developed so many friends over the last year.
[09:48:03.123 --> 09:48:05.265]  And they cry when they see what's happened.
[09:48:05.345 --> 09:48:16.875]  I passed factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100%, it is just horrible what's happened to these people in these communities.
[09:48:17.196 --> 09:48:20.579]  Now she can say that her husband did well, but boy did they suffer as
[09:48:21.099 --> 09:48:25.524]  NAFTA kicked in, because it didn't really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left.
[09:48:25.864 --> 09:48:26.745]  Boy did they suffer.
[09:48:27.205 --> 09:48:30.608]  That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country.
[09:48:30.929 --> 09:48:34.152]  Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership, and she wants it.
[09:48:34.592 --> 09:48:37.936]  She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates.
[09:48:38.016 --> 09:48:38.836]  She totally lied.
[09:48:39.177 --> 09:48:43.181]  She did call it the gold standard, and they actually fact-checked, and they said I was right.
[09:48:44.002 --> 09:48:50.389]  I want to give you a chance to briefly speak to that, and then I want to pivot to 1.6, which is Obamacare.
[09:48:50.429 --> 09:48:51.790]  But go ahead, briefly.
[09:48:51.990 --> 09:48:58.938]  First, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it.
[09:48:58.998 --> 09:49:00.039]  It didn't meet my tests.
[09:49:00.079 --> 09:49:01.021]  I've had the same tests.
[09:49:01.461 --> 09:49:03.844]  Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and
[09:49:04.144 --> 09:49:05.405]  Further our national security.
[09:49:05.445 --> 09:49:06.265]  I'm against it now.
[09:49:06.385 --> 09:49:07.665]  I'll be against it after the election.
[09:49:07.685 --> 09:49:09.026]  I'll be against it when I'm president.
[09:49:09.446 --> 09:49:14.008]  There's only one of us on this stage who's actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that's Donald.
[09:49:14.068 --> 09:49:17.249]  He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.
[09:49:17.289 --> 09:49:18.250]  But he mentioned China.
[09:49:18.790 --> 09:49:25.172]  And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets.
[09:49:25.572 --> 09:49:26.673]  I have fought against that.
[09:49:27.193 --> 09:49:30.034]  As a senator, I've stood up against it as Secretary of State.
[09:49:30.434 --> 09:49:33.135]  Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum.
[09:49:33.475 --> 09:49:37.476]  In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel.
[09:49:37.736 --> 09:49:40.857]  So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is.
[09:49:41.177 --> 09:49:45.238]  But he has given jobs to Chinese steel workers, not American steel workers.
[09:49:45.598 --> 09:49:49.259]  That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work.
[09:49:49.579 --> 09:49:51.099]  We're going to pull the country together.
[09:49:51.119 --> 09:49:53.140]  We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce.
[09:49:53.160 --> 09:49:56.981]  That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history.
[09:49:57.381 --> 09:49:59.421]  And we're going to enforce those agreements.
[09:49:59.641 --> 09:50:04.163]  And we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products.
[09:50:06.343 --> 09:50:07.904]  She's been doing this for 30 years.
[09:50:08.504 --> 09:50:12.287]  Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years?
[09:50:12.687 --> 09:50:15.529]  You were very much involved, excuse me, my turn.
[09:50:15.849 --> 09:50:19.612]  You were very much involved in every aspect of this country.
[09:50:20.032 --> 09:50:20.492]  Very much.
[09:50:20.892 --> 09:50:21.953]  And you do have experience.
[09:50:22.013 --> 09:50:25.195]  I'd say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience.
[09:50:25.275 --> 09:50:27.537]  Because what you've done has turned out badly.
[09:50:28.037 --> 09:50:33.180]  For 30 years you've been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else,
[09:50:34.241 --> 09:50:36.362]  Make it impossible for me to do that.
[09:50:36.682 --> 09:50:37.302]  I wouldn't mind.
[09:50:37.842 --> 09:50:41.144]  The problem is you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary.
[09:50:41.384 --> 09:50:41.764]  You don't.
[09:50:42.204 --> 09:50:47.186]  Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing.
[09:50:47.286 --> 09:50:48.566]  How do you miss $6 billion?
[09:50:48.846 --> 09:50:53.308]  You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen.
[09:50:53.528 --> 09:50:54.008]  They don't know.
[09:50:54.589 --> 09:50:55.029]  It's gone.
[09:50:55.049 --> 09:50:56.129]  $6 billion.
[09:50:57.390 --> 09:51:02.652]  If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess.
[09:51:02.972 --> 09:51:03.412]  Believe me.
[09:51:03.854 --> 09:51:06.895]  Well, first of all, what he just said... Alright, shut that liar down.
[09:51:08.296 --> 09:51:15.079]  Folks, just like I said last week, I said it's 3 against 1, and then he said it's 3 against 1, we're like synced.
[09:51:15.099 --> 09:51:18.861]  There isn't any wires in our ears, you know, literally to each other, but we're synced in common sense.
[09:51:19.421 --> 09:51:20.382]  I was just going to cut in.
[09:51:20.442 --> 09:51:21.743]  I'm like, hit her with the facts.
[09:51:21.783 --> 09:51:24.486]  They've been running the country for almost 30 years.
[09:51:24.626 --> 09:51:27.589]  People, if you want something different, get this lady out of your life.
[09:51:27.629 --> 09:51:29.271]  She sold us out to multinationals.
[09:51:29.811 --> 09:51:33.795]  When they keep the taxes higher than China on corporations, it makes us move.
[09:51:34.115 --> 09:51:37.138]  She knows what she's doing, and we've got WikiLeaks proving it.
[09:51:37.339 --> 09:51:39.961]  It's not like we don't just know looking at it.
[09:51:40.001 --> 09:51:40.902]  We have the facts.
[09:51:41.282 --> 09:51:43.224]  This damn woman hates America!
[09:51:43.965 --> 09:51:46.026]  She wears Mao outfits on TV!
[09:51:46.486 --> 09:51:48.327]  Go back to this piece of trash.
[09:51:48.427 --> 09:51:50.868]  ...Alicia Machado called her an eating machine.
[09:51:51.248 --> 09:51:57.571]  Oh, he was mean to girls like when they killed Chinese women's babies and sell the women's organs.
[09:51:57.811 --> 09:52:10.116]  Oh, let's talk about the Al-Qaeda killing women and selling their organs and ISIS and six-year-old girls and sex slavery and how you stay in the same room with Uma Abedin whose mother's the top sexual mutilation of women pimp in the world.
[09:52:10.776 --> 09:52:11.356]  What the hell?
[09:52:11.556 --> 09:52:12.976]  You steal the Haitian money!
[09:52:13.157 --> 09:52:14.457]  You're a criminal monster!
[09:52:14.657 --> 09:52:15.617]  We have the emails!
[09:52:15.817 --> 09:52:16.937]  You want our guns!
[09:52:17.137 --> 09:52:18.398]  You lie about everything!
[09:52:18.558 --> 09:52:22.739]  You're a monstrous pig picked by the globalists to curse this country!
[09:52:23.259 --> 09:52:24.979]  Worth many, many billions of dollars.
[09:52:25.899 --> 09:52:27.900]  I started with a $1 million loan.
[09:52:27.980 --> 09:52:28.680]  I agree with that.
[09:52:28.740 --> 09:52:29.960]  It's a $1 million loan.
[09:52:29.980 --> 09:52:32.341]  But I built a phenomenal company.
[09:52:32.941 --> 09:52:38.322]  And if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country
[09:52:38.502 --> 09:52:43.444]  My dad, in 1995, when I was starting out in media, gave me a $50,000 loan.
[09:52:43.764 --> 09:52:46.906]  And in 1998, I paid it back.
[09:52:47.106 --> 09:52:48.466]  He didn't ask for it with interest.
[09:52:48.486 --> 09:52:48.466]  $75,000.
[09:52:49.087 --> 09:52:51.648]  My dad gave me $50,000.
[09:52:51.728 --> 09:52:53.609]  His dad gave me a million.
[09:52:54.229 --> 09:52:58.411]  You have done nothing but run governments and run us on the ground, you frickin' scumbag!
[09:52:58.651 --> 09:52:59.491]  Back to Donald Trump.
[09:53:01.252 --> 09:53:04.294]  But once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out.
[09:53:04.314 --> 09:53:05.395]  They always lie and say he wasn't.
[09:53:05.415 --> 09:53:07.456]  We got him on tape.
[09:53:07.496 --> 09:53:08.837]  He was right!
[09:53:09.078 --> 09:53:11.960]  You killed millions of Iraqis, bitch!
[09:53:12.000 --> 09:53:12.680]  Tell me that!
[09:53:12.720 --> 09:53:13.941]  She's going to get rid of ISIS.
[09:53:14.561 --> 09:53:15.962]  She's going to get rid of nobody.
[09:53:27.352 --> 09:53:32.475]  You said your talk about grabbing women was just that, talk.
[09:53:32.635 --> 09:53:34.516]  Yeah, like Clinton settled rape cases.
[09:53:34.657 --> 09:53:36.017]  And since then... Here we go, get ready.
[09:53:36.298 --> 09:53:41.461]  We all know nine women have come forward and said you either roped them or kissed them without their consent.
[09:53:46.092 --> 09:53:52.000]  Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances... Why did Bill Clinton settle so many rape cases?
[09:53:52.180 --> 09:53:53.021]  Good question.
[09:53:53.041 --> 09:53:55.584]  Yeah, Trump, why did Bill Clinton settle so many rape cases?
[09:53:55.604 --> 09:53:58.848]  A lot of these women wait until, you know, a month out.
[09:54:01.892 --> 09:54:03.473]  Who sleeps with Islamists.
[09:54:03.693 --> 09:54:07.075]  Your husband did, and that you defended was even worse.
[09:54:07.475 --> 09:54:08.696]  Mr. Trump, you go first.
[09:54:08.776 --> 09:54:11.737]  Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked.
[09:54:12.578 --> 09:54:14.079]  Those people, I don't know those people.
[09:54:14.499 --> 09:54:15.839]  I have a feeling how they came.
[09:54:15.920 --> 09:54:17.600]  I believe it was her campaign that did it.
[09:54:17.680 --> 09:54:27.686]  Just like if you look at what came out today on The Clips, where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence.
[09:54:28.829 --> 09:54:31.232]  She's the one in Obama that caused the violence.
[09:54:31.252 --> 09:54:31.713]  They sent the email.
[09:54:31.753 --> 09:54:32.614]  They hired people.
[09:54:32.995 --> 09:54:39.564]  They paid them $1,500 and they're on tape saying, be violent, cause fights, do bad things.
[09:54:40.044 --> 09:54:42.948]  I would say the only way because those stories are all totally false.
[09:54:42.968 --> 09:54:43.649]  I have to say that.
[09:54:44.505 --> 09:54:49.087]  And I didn't even apologize to my wife, who's sitting right here, because I didn't do anything.
[09:54:49.767 --> 09:54:51.607]  I didn't know any of these women.
[09:54:51.767 --> 09:54:52.808]  I didn't see these women.
[09:54:53.228 --> 09:54:56.349]  These women... Folks, they put a woman on the line and say I'm married to them.
[09:54:56.369 --> 09:54:58.010]  I think they want either fame... I never met them.
[09:54:58.210 --> 09:54:59.270]  ...or her campaign did it.
[09:54:59.290 --> 09:54:59.530]  Thanks to me.
[09:54:59.570 --> 09:55:00.550]  And I think it's her campaign.
[09:55:00.991 --> 09:55:02.911]  Because what I saw... They're women saying I raped them.
[09:55:02.971 --> 09:55:03.471]  I never met.
[09:55:03.531 --> 09:55:03.992]  Me, me.
[09:55:04.192 --> 09:55:05.772]  Which is a criminal act, by the way.
[09:55:05.792 --> 09:55:06.052]  Yes.
[09:55:06.252 --> 09:55:09.914]  Where they're telling people to go out and start fistfights and start violence.
[09:55:09.934 --> 09:55:10.574]  And I'll tell you what.
[09:55:11.414 --> 09:55:16.156]  In particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot.
[09:55:16.437 --> 09:55:19.338]  And that was now all on tape, started by her.
[09:55:19.358 --> 09:55:20.499]  Emails!
[09:55:20.519 --> 09:55:21.519]  She ran the whole thing!
[09:55:21.759 --> 09:55:22.079]  She did!
[09:55:22.099 --> 09:55:24.140]  She got these people to step forward.
[09:55:24.601 --> 09:55:27.182]  If it wasn't, they'd get their 10 minutes of fame.
[09:55:27.842 --> 09:55:30.524]  But they were all totally, it was all fiction.
[09:55:30.604 --> 09:55:32.265]  It was lies and it was fiction.
[09:55:32.545 --> 09:55:35.006]  They've called 3,000 women now, they've got 9 of them to make crap up.
[09:55:35.266 --> 09:55:40.829]  At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women.
[09:55:41.880 --> 09:56:11.307]  Bring up her husband, bring up her girlfriend, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit her, hit
[09:56:11.807 --> 09:56:14.188]  He went on to say, look at her.
[09:56:14.888 --> 09:56:15.728]  I don't think so.
[09:56:16.328 --> 09:56:20.669]  About another woman, he said, that wouldn't be my first choice.
[09:56:21.450 --> 09:56:29.012]  He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her disgusting, as he has called a number of women during this campaign.
[09:56:29.032 --> 09:56:31.512]  Women think they're getting ahead working for the government?
[09:56:31.752 --> 09:56:33.953]  Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.
[09:56:34.753 --> 09:56:38.536]  He goes after their dignity, their self-worth.
[09:56:38.596 --> 09:56:39.317]  Oh, they're making it up.
[09:56:39.457 --> 09:56:42.479]  And I don't think there is a woman anywhere... You've got crazy women all over.
[09:56:42.599 --> 09:56:43.760]  I'm married to them.
[09:56:43.880 --> 09:56:44.581]  Screw these people.
[09:56:44.721 --> 09:56:49.404]  So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women.
[09:56:49.424 --> 09:56:50.785]  I mean, call me a Russian agent, man.
[09:56:50.826 --> 09:56:52.207]  At a certain point, I'm tired of it.
[09:56:52.787 --> 09:56:58.491]  I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is.
[09:56:58.511 --> 09:57:00.173]  When you stole the Haitian money from the children.
[09:57:00.193 --> 09:57:01.214]  And to stand up and
[09:57:02.045 --> 09:57:07.149]  Be very clear about what we expect from our next president.
[09:57:07.189 --> 09:57:09.271]  How we want to bring our country together.
[09:57:10.072 --> 09:57:16.297]  Where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other.
[09:57:16.737 --> 09:57:18.959]  Which your own emails show you're dying for race war.
[09:57:19.059 --> 09:57:23.943]  We lift people up and we make our country even greater.
[09:57:24.063 --> 09:57:26.485]  America is great because America is good.
[09:57:28.607 --> 09:57:36.534]  And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our families.
[09:57:36.674 --> 09:57:38.035]  I hate you so much, lady.
[09:57:38.336 --> 09:57:38.996]  I hate you!
[09:57:39.036 --> 09:57:40.217]  Nobody has more respect.
[09:57:40.438 --> 09:57:41.318]  Such a pig!
[09:57:41.639 --> 09:57:41.999]  Nobody.
[09:57:42.880 --> 09:57:43.861]  Nobody has more respect.
[09:57:43.881 --> 09:57:44.481]  Please, everybody.
[09:57:44.501 --> 09:57:46.883]  Show the girl they robbed.
[09:57:46.943 --> 09:57:47.404]  Show the girl.
[09:57:48.024 --> 09:57:49.045]  Those stories have been large.
[09:57:49.085 --> 09:57:49.926]  Show the Clinton victim.
[09:57:50.046 --> 09:57:54.490]  And I really want to just talk about something slightly different.
[09:57:55.518 --> 09:58:04.214]  She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her... They run the whole thing, we have the, you know...
[09:58:05.523 --> 09:58:09.665]  But I will tell you, what isn't fictionalized is her robbing that little black girl.
[09:58:09.685 --> 09:58:16.908]  She destroyed 33,000 emails, criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.
[09:58:17.648 --> 09:58:19.489]  Tell you what didn't fictionalize, put the Haitian girl on.
[09:58:19.709 --> 09:58:22.791]  What didn't fictionalize, she robbed that girl of almost all the money.
[09:58:23.211 --> 09:58:31.415]  Today, she's credited in all the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI.
[09:58:32.215 --> 09:58:32.615]  One lie.
[09:58:33.636 --> 09:58:34.236]  She's lied
[09:58:35.265 --> 09:58:36.045]  Hundreds of times.
[09:58:36.085 --> 09:58:37.086]  And tried to bribe the FBI.
[09:58:37.286 --> 09:58:39.887]  To Congress, and to the FBI.
[09:58:40.688 --> 09:58:42.429]  He's going to probably go to jail.
[09:58:42.449 --> 09:58:45.290]  This is a four-star general.
[09:58:45.930 --> 09:58:50.372]  And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States?
[09:58:51.193 --> 09:58:53.174]  That's really what you should be talking about.
[09:58:53.494 --> 09:58:58.456]  Not fiction, where somebody wants fame, or where they come out of her crooked campaign.
[09:58:58.596 --> 09:58:59.297]  Secretary Clinton.
[09:59:00.856 --> 09:59:04.479]  Every time, uh, Donald's pushed on something, which is obviously uncomfortable.
[09:59:19.244 --> 09:59:20.265]  He never thought about women.
[09:59:20.285 --> 09:59:24.086]  Let's show the starving black child by herself, her parents dead, no aid.
[09:59:24.607 --> 09:59:25.507]  In Haiti, you stole the money.
[09:59:25.547 --> 09:59:26.668]  Here, let's show your victim.
[09:59:26.708 --> 09:59:32.691]  But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.
[09:59:33.571 --> 09:59:34.512]  That was out of context.
[09:59:34.892 --> 09:59:36.373]  Infowars.com, Ford Slush Show.
[09:59:36.613 --> 09:59:37.513]  See the video.
[09:59:38.534 --> 09:59:43.597]  Young man who died serving our country, a gold star family because of their religion.
[09:59:43.617 --> 09:59:43.797]  No!
[09:59:43.957 --> 09:59:46.618]  The father's involved in Syria law, pushing his craft.
[09:59:46.738 --> 09:59:47.539]  Trump exposed it.
[09:59:48.615 --> 09:59:50.497]  People who aren't captured.
[09:59:51.438 --> 09:59:55.642]  He went after a federal judge born in Indiana.
[09:59:55.682 --> 10:00:01.267]  Who is part of La Raza and Mecha and a Mexican KKK member in my opinion.
[10:00:01.448 --> 10:00:03.910]  His dad is a Lorican Quista head.
[10:00:04.010 --> 10:00:05.271]  He is a Lorican Quista.
[10:00:08.274 --> 10:00:12.979]  I say screw the Klan, screw the Mexican races, black races, I'm done.
[10:00:13.019 --> 10:00:15.361]  What about prosperity?
[10:00:15.761 --> 10:00:17.403]  Dangerous vision?
[10:00:17.823 --> 10:00:22.828]  No, he's ten points ahead, lady.
[10:00:23.309 --> 10:00:25.271]  Oh my God, every time they send them!
[10:00:25.491 --> 10:00:28.634]  I mean, I cannot handle this, she's caught in the emails!
[10:00:29.254 --> 10:00:30.416]  The media will not call her.
[10:00:31.096 --> 10:00:35.659]  More and more people will understand what's at stake in this election.
[10:00:48.849 --> 10:00:49.890]  I'd love to talk about it.
[10:00:49.910 --> 10:00:52.451]  We have Wikileaks, and we have the National Coordinator in Manningham.
[10:00:52.491 --> 10:00:53.211]  We have you, lady.
[10:00:53.231 --> 10:00:55.852]  But those other charges, as she knows, there are false.
[10:00:56.133 --> 10:01:03.076]  In this buffet about fitness to be president, there's been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate.
[10:01:03.456 --> 10:01:05.137]  I'd like to ask you about them.
[10:01:05.177 --> 10:01:06.978]  These are questions that the American people have.
[10:01:06.998 --> 10:01:14.882]  Secretary Clinton, during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing, you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest.
[10:01:15.922 --> 10:01:19.465]  With your dealing with the Clinton Foundation while you were Secretary of State.
[10:01:19.626 --> 10:01:23.129]  Emails show that donors got special access to you.
[10:01:23.709 --> 10:01:31.256]  Those seeking grants for Haiti relief were considered separately from non-donors and some of those donors got
[10:01:33.379 --> 10:01:34.581]  They were friends.
[10:01:35.422 --> 10:01:39.227]  And they put the money back in the foundation.
[10:01:39.627 --> 10:01:40.468]  She didn't just keep 94%.
[10:01:41.490 --> 10:01:44.253]  The little bit she gave to Abe, they had to pay her back with the money.
[10:01:47.130 --> 10:01:53.231]  Well, everything I did as Secretary of State was in furtherance of our country's interests.
[10:01:53.351 --> 10:01:54.272]  Oh yeah, sure.
[10:01:54.332 --> 10:01:56.272]  Wallace has been the fairest yet, but he's still not fair.
[10:01:57.112 --> 10:01:58.752]  He's like 55-45.
[10:01:58.912 --> 10:02:03.713]  I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation because it is a world-renowned... You're thrilled?
[10:02:03.753 --> 10:02:05.334]  What a piece of trash you are.
[10:02:05.374 --> 10:02:07.334]  Your own daughter said you were killing people in Haiti.
[10:02:07.374 --> 10:02:08.855]  I'll talk for the rest of the debate.
[10:02:08.895 --> 10:02:10.535]  I know I don't have the time to do that.
[10:02:10.995 --> 10:02:15.056]  But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation... Let's put some articles on screen.
[10:02:16.381 --> 10:02:18.082]  Chelsea's saying we're killing people.
[10:02:19.483 --> 10:02:21.304]  Oh my God!
[10:02:21.744 --> 10:02:27.687]  They ship for 10 years blood out of their hospitals and out of their prisons, knowing it had HIV and hepatitis.
[10:02:28.067 --> 10:02:29.088]  Famous blood scandal.
[10:02:29.108 --> 10:02:30.248]  Look up the Clinton blood scandal.
[10:02:30.288 --> 10:02:31.109]  Nobody knows about it.
[10:02:31.489 --> 10:02:33.390]  And she's talking about fighting HIV and AIDS.
[10:02:33.490 --> 10:02:35.271]  I cannot handle this anymore.
[10:02:35.291 --> 10:02:35.891]  Go back to him.
[10:02:35.931 --> 10:02:37.072]  No one's hit her with the HIV blood.
[10:02:37.092 --> 10:02:37.252]  Hit her!
[10:02:44.776 --> 10:02:45.057]  Hit her!
[10:02:45.337 --> 10:02:45.557]  Hit her!
[10:02:45.617 --> 10:02:48.982]  And it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.
[10:02:49.082 --> 10:02:55.992]  It's a criminal enterprise, Saudi Arabia giving 25 million dollars, Qatar, all of these countries.
[10:02:56.032 --> 10:02:57.654]  You talk about women and women's rights?
[10:02:57.754 --> 10:02:57.954]  Yes.
[10:02:58.375 --> 10:03:00.778]  So, these are people that push gays.
[10:03:01.619 --> 10:03:02.940]  Off business, off buildings.
[10:03:03.400 --> 10:03:08.883]  These are people that kill women and treat women horribly, and yet you take their money.
[10:03:09.323 --> 10:03:17.707]  So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people
[10:03:18.567 --> 10:03:19.167]  So horribly.
[10:03:19.207 --> 10:03:20.468]  Why don't you give back the money?
[10:03:20.548 --> 10:03:22.168]  I think it would be a great gesture.
[10:03:22.388 --> 10:03:26.990]  Because she takes a tremendous amount of money, and you take a look at the people of Haiti.
[10:03:27.570 --> 10:03:29.230]  I was in a little Haiti the other day.
[10:03:29.250 --> 10:03:30.011]  Yes, Florida.
[10:03:30.431 --> 10:03:33.092]  And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons.
[10:03:33.472 --> 10:03:38.933]  Because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace.
[10:03:38.953 --> 10:03:40.574]  And you know it, and they know it.
[10:03:40.594 --> 10:03:42.154]  Trump is looking at flying to Haiti this week.
[10:03:42.174 --> 10:03:45.455]  Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90%, 90%
[10:03:47.876 --> 10:03:48.016]  Wow!
[10:03:48.416 --> 10:03:48.596]  Wow!
[10:03:48.616 --> 10:03:51.358]  Even Politico admits they ripped off.
[10:03:51.438 --> 10:03:54.359]  Even the emails from Chelsea, she is the biggest liar.
[10:04:16.471 --> 10:04:18.292]  They give 4% of their own money.
[10:04:18.572 --> 10:04:20.473]  Oh my God.
[10:04:20.614 --> 10:04:22.134]  I've never seen this.
[10:04:22.194 --> 10:04:26.037]  We're raising money again and we want to help you so much.
[10:04:26.077 --> 10:04:27.578]  We didn't have sex with that lady either.
[10:04:27.598 --> 10:04:28.839]  They shut a sweatshop up.
[10:04:43.107 --> 10:04:45.008]  Riots would start, we'd mention the Clinton name.
[10:04:46.589 --> 10:04:47.670]  I'd like to mention one thing.
[10:04:48.150 --> 10:04:49.671]  Trump Foundation, small foundation.
[10:04:50.311 --> 10:04:51.972]  People contribute, I contribute.
[10:04:52.233 --> 10:04:52.733]  The money goes 100%.
[10:04:52.833 --> 10:04:59.697]  100% goes to different charities including... I don't buy boats, I don't buy planes.
[10:05:00.037 --> 10:05:04.240]  What happens... Wasn't some of the money used to settle your lawsuit, sir?
[10:05:04.600 --> 10:05:06.621]  No, it was, we put up the American flag.
[10:05:07.201 --> 10:05:08.241]  And that's it.
[10:05:08.401 --> 10:05:09.522]  They put up the American flag.
[10:05:09.542 --> 10:05:12.102]  We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag.
[10:05:12.162 --> 10:05:14.363]  There was a penalty that was imposed.
[10:05:14.383 --> 10:05:16.024]  And that paid for the lawsuit, dickhead!
[10:05:16.104 --> 10:05:18.244]  And the money came from your foundation.
[10:05:18.284 --> 10:05:23.326]  And by the way, the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses.
[10:05:23.706 --> 10:05:29.308]  The money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled folks.
[10:05:29.388 --> 10:05:30.588]  I want to get into one last point.
[10:05:30.768 --> 10:05:34.231]  There's no way we can know whether any of that is true because he hasn't released his tax return.
[10:05:34.271 --> 10:05:37.755]  No, because you won't release the Clinton Foundation stuff, you liar!
[10:05:37.875 --> 10:05:45.382]  In the last 40 plus years, he has not released his tax return, so everything he says about charity... I love all these soft demons that are signed on there.
[10:05:45.462 --> 10:05:52.509]  You're all going to fail, I can smell your... You can look at our tax returns, we've got them all out there, but what is really... Fee-fi-fo-fum.
[10:05:53.150 --> 10:05:55.132]  I smell the blood of an Englishman.
[10:05:55.913 --> 10:06:03.204]  Be he live or be he dead, I'll ground your bones to make my bread before I die!
[10:06:04.155 --> 10:06:07.956]  Undocumented immigrants in our country actually pay federal income tax.
[10:06:07.996 --> 10:06:14.018]  So, we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.
[10:06:14.338 --> 10:06:16.498]  I find that just astonishing.
[10:06:16.778 --> 10:06:22.940]  We're entitled, because of the laws that people like her pass, to take massive amounts of depreciation and other charges.
[10:06:22.960 --> 10:06:25.201]  Hillary is selling you Magic Bean stocks.
[10:06:25.241 --> 10:06:28.402]  Trump is selling you Americana.
[10:06:28.522 --> 10:06:30.382]  I mean, he is our last guest, folks.
[10:06:30.682 --> 10:06:32.423]  He means to... He just wants to take the...
[10:06:33.903 --> 10:06:36.084]  Take the tank cuffs off.
[10:06:36.104 --> 10:06:37.624]  That's all he's got to do, we explode.
[10:06:37.764 --> 10:06:43.166]  Hillary's going to bring in all the workers, as long as they're not felons.
[10:06:43.666 --> 10:06:47.887]  He just said he's going to make it easier to come in legal if you're not a freaking criminal.
[10:06:48.688 --> 10:06:49.428]  You're not a rapist?
[10:06:49.468 --> 10:06:50.128]  Come on in!
[10:06:51.128 --> 10:06:53.009]  Jesus, I cannot believe this.
[10:06:53.209 --> 10:06:55.190]  At least he got quoted tonight, though.
[10:06:55.230 --> 10:06:58.571]  His full quote from here and a half ago was, if you're a criminal, we're deporting your ass.
[10:06:58.931 --> 10:07:02.632]  If you're illegal, if you're not a criminal, we can get you back in if you've got a job.
[10:07:03.387 --> 10:07:12.629]  I will tell you, I sat there, I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad, all paid for by your friends on Wall Street.
[10:07:12.649 --> 10:07:13.409]  And he got no corporate money.
[10:07:13.429 --> 10:07:16.870]  They gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them.
[10:07:17.370 --> 10:07:19.751]  And frankly, you should have changed the law.
[10:07:19.871 --> 10:07:22.391]  If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the law.
[10:07:22.411 --> 10:07:25.852]  Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about one last question in this topic.
[10:07:26.152 --> 10:07:27.353]  No money from Wall Street, folks.
[10:07:27.393 --> 10:07:28.654]  You claim you're anti-establishment?
[10:07:44.628 --> 10:07:48.072]  We'll absolutely accept the result of this election.
[10:07:48.152 --> 10:07:51.316]  Today, your daughter Ivanka said the same thing.
[10:07:51.356 --> 10:07:55.141]  I want to ask you here on this stage tonight, do you make the same conviction?
[10:07:55.161 --> 10:07:59.006]  Hillary claims Russia's running it, then says no election fraud's happening.
[10:07:59.026 --> 10:08:00.207]  Trump works with Russia!
[10:08:01.949 --> 10:08:03.270]  I'm not looking at anything now.
[10:08:03.330 --> 10:08:04.391]  I'll look at it at the time.
[10:08:04.971 --> 10:08:07.613]  What I've seen, what I've seen is so bad.
[10:08:07.994 --> 10:08:13.578]  First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt and the pylon is so amazing.
[10:08:13.598 --> 10:08:13.818]  Yes.
[10:08:14.378 --> 10:08:17.260]  The New York Times actually wrote an article about it that they don't even care.
[10:08:18.081 --> 10:08:24.969]  It's so dishonest, and they've poisoned the minds of the voters, but unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it.
[10:08:25.189 --> 10:08:26.170]  I think they're going to see through it.
[10:08:26.190 --> 10:08:28.512]  We'll find out on November 8th, but I think they're going to see through it.
[10:08:28.532 --> 10:08:33.798]  But sir, there's a... If you look, excuse me Chris, if you look at your voter rolls, you will see
[10:08:34.859 --> 10:08:37.260]  Millions of people that are registered to vote.
[10:08:37.360 --> 10:08:37.740]  Millions.
[10:08:37.760 --> 10:08:38.881]  This isn't coming from me.
[10:08:38.941 --> 10:08:41.282]  This is coming from Pew Report and other places.
[10:08:41.862 --> 10:08:46.564]  Millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.
[10:08:46.584 --> 10:08:48.365]  And the Democrats brag that people vote to not speak.
[10:08:48.485 --> 10:08:50.205]  Let me just give you one other thing.
[10:08:50.265 --> 10:08:51.706]  I talk about the corrupt media.
[10:08:51.806 --> 10:08:53.287]  I talk about the millions of people.
[10:08:53.427 --> 10:08:54.507]  I'll tell you one other thing.
[10:08:55.267 --> 10:08:56.368]  She shouldn't be allowed to run.
[10:08:58.529 --> 10:09:01.492]  She's guilty of a very, very serious crime.
[10:09:01.572 --> 10:09:02.874]  She stole the nomination from Sanders!
[10:09:02.894 --> 10:09:03.975]  She should not be allowed to run.
[10:09:04.475 --> 10:09:07.198]  And just in that respect... It's rigged.
[10:09:07.758 --> 10:09:08.519]  It's rigged.
[10:09:08.839 --> 10:09:17.688]  Because she should never... Trist, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with emails and so many other things.
[10:09:17.788 --> 10:09:24.213]  But sir, there is a tradition in this country, in fact one of the prides of this country, is the peaceful transition of power.
[10:09:24.233 --> 10:09:25.214]  Oh, Hillary will teach us about America.
[10:09:25.274 --> 10:09:34.482]  And that's how harsh what a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign, that the loser concedes to the winner, not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser.
[10:09:34.502 --> 10:09:44.350]  You've got illegals and everybody voting all over the country, it's on video, Democrat, the head of the National Democrat Organization says, we're stealing it, we control the Justice Department, F you!
[10:09:44.750 --> 10:09:45.990]  I will tell you at the time.
[10:09:46.170 --> 10:09:47.331]  I'll keep you in suspense.
[10:09:47.391 --> 10:09:51.072]  Oh my... Chris, let me respond to that because that's horrifying.
[10:09:51.572 --> 10:09:52.993]  You know, every time... It's horrifying.
[10:09:53.013 --> 10:09:58.814]  We have our operatives in the field, stealing the election as we speak, while blaming him of stealing it with the Russians.
[10:09:59.034 --> 10:10:11.198]  Remember, no one's pointing out, they're saying the Russians are stealing it, while they say he's a kook, while the Democrats have been caught in Ohio, Florida, New York, stealing it in early voting, and bragging on hidden camera!
[10:10:11.558 --> 10:10:12.419]  Ha ha!
[10:10:12.839 --> 10:10:13.379]  Wow!
[10:10:15.148 --> 10:10:18.689]  That's why I'm interrupting this woman, because I'm not going to sit here and watch him get ganged up on!
[10:10:18.950 --> 10:10:21.951]  I will not put up with your horse crap anymore!
[10:10:22.251 --> 10:10:22.991]  Damn traitors!
[10:10:23.071 --> 10:10:24.912]  Man, I'll kill you!
[10:10:25.512 --> 10:10:26.773]  I'm bored!
[10:10:26.873 --> 10:10:28.534]  Oh my God!
[10:10:28.574 --> 10:10:29.214]  Woman!
[10:10:29.594 --> 10:10:29.994]  Woman!
[10:10:30.214 --> 10:10:31.475]  You have 200 people!
[10:10:31.495 --> 10:10:33.176]  He has 50,000 in his events!
[10:10:33.616 --> 10:10:35.136]  All the Google metrics show!
[10:10:35.156 --> 10:10:36.537]  10 times the support!
[10:10:37.197 --> 10:10:39.338]  Internal polls show he's winning by 60%!
[10:10:40.119 --> 10:10:41.039]  You know it!
[10:10:41.299 --> 10:10:42.960]  And you're getting us ready to steal it!
[10:10:43.840 --> 10:10:45.802]  We don't want an evil, wicked witch!
[10:10:46.122 --> 10:10:48.264]  We don't want a Clinton-Bush corpse!
[10:10:48.724 --> 10:10:53.808]  Yes, accept the outcome when you gang-rape us!
[10:10:54.029 --> 10:10:56.190]  No, we don't accept Obamacare!
[10:10:56.591 --> 10:10:59.613]  No, we don't accept banning Islam at open borders!
[10:10:59.973 --> 10:11:03.376]  No, we don't accept world government taking our guns!
[10:11:03.777 --> 10:11:04.257]  No!
[10:11:04.277 --> 10:11:04.317]  No!
[10:11:04.737 --> 10:11:05.218]  No!
[10:11:05.238 --> 10:11:05.278]  No!
[10:11:05.718 --> 10:11:06.199]  No!
[10:11:06.219 --> 10:11:06.259]  No!
[10:11:06.279 --> 10:11:06.619]  No!
[10:11:06.679 --> 10:11:07.159]  No!
[10:11:07.179 --> 10:11:07.219]  No!
[10:11:07.620 --> 10:11:07.940]  No!
[10:11:12.904 --> 10:11:15.846]  Denigrating, he's talking down our democracy.
[10:11:16.026 --> 10:11:16.326]  Oh yeah!
[10:11:16.346 --> 10:11:18.387]  And I, for one, am appalled.
[10:11:18.487 --> 10:11:20.768]  You work for a shadow government in WikiLeaks, you pig!
[10:11:20.788 --> 10:11:22.209]  One of our two major parties.
[10:11:22.249 --> 10:11:22.729]  Hit her with that!
[10:11:22.749 --> 10:11:24.510]  Take that kind of position.
[10:11:24.530 --> 10:11:25.290]  Hit that pig!
[10:11:25.310 --> 10:11:26.111]  The FBI did.
[10:11:26.411 --> 10:11:27.131]  Hit that pig!
[10:11:27.151 --> 10:11:34.175]  The Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the Attorney General, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac.
[10:11:35.026 --> 10:11:35.786]  In Arizona.
[10:11:36.406 --> 10:11:37.447]  So arrogant.
[10:11:37.827 --> 10:11:39.027]  I think it's a disgrace.
[10:11:39.087 --> 10:11:41.048]  I think we've never had a situation so bad.
[10:11:41.068 --> 10:11:41.888]  Hold on, folks.
[10:11:42.608 --> 10:11:45.049]  This doesn't do any good for anyone.
[10:11:45.109 --> 10:11:48.930]  Let's please continue the debate and let's move on to the subject of foreign hotspots.
[10:11:49.010 --> 10:11:49.930]  Trump's winning this.
[10:11:49.970 --> 10:11:52.611]  Not as big of a loss to make, but it's still his best performance.
[10:11:52.631 --> 10:11:54.132]  Pressure Donald Trump.
[10:11:55.332 --> 10:12:01.534]  If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes
[10:12:02.574 --> 10:12:03.915]  What happens the day after?
[10:12:03.996 --> 10:12:13.345]  And that's something that whichever of you ends up, whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to comment on.
[10:12:13.426 --> 10:12:14.467]  Folks, gear up!
[10:12:14.587 --> 10:12:15.688]  This is it, boys!
[10:12:16.048 --> 10:12:17.270]  We're going in!
[10:12:17.730 --> 10:12:20.073]  And I've already cut across their axes to draw their fire.
[10:12:22.950 --> 10:12:31.393]  Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort, led by the Iraqi Army, supported by Kurdish forces.
[10:12:31.453 --> 10:12:33.654]  Which she's been battling the whole time.
[10:12:34.194 --> 10:12:36.295]  On record, defense intelligence is on record.
[10:12:36.735 --> 10:12:41.197]  They're putting Wahhabis in charge, Middle East one, and now she's claiming she's against it.
[10:12:41.517 --> 10:12:45.679]  They admitted that Al-Qaeda's ISIS is about to launch a chemical attack.
[10:12:46.519 --> 10:12:50.421]  I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that was smart to do.
[10:12:51.121 --> 10:12:52.822]  Because we killed 55 million babies, folks.
[10:12:52.842 --> 10:12:53.963]  We have this demon put in.
[10:12:54.223 --> 10:12:57.085]  ...waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.
[10:12:57.545 --> 10:13:00.087]  The goal here is to take back Mosul.
[10:13:00.167 --> 10:13:01.388]  It's going to be a hard fight.
[10:13:01.448 --> 10:13:03.449]  I've got no illusions about that.
[10:13:03.489 --> 10:13:03.750]  Mosul, the U.S.
[10:13:03.770 --> 10:13:05.871]  is bombing Russian forces trying to get into Mosul.
[10:13:06.111 --> 10:13:10.294]  So the Russians have put up a no-fly zone and are ready for World War III.
[10:13:10.314 --> 10:13:11.034]  They've committed.
[10:13:11.074 --> 10:13:12.595]  They're battling radical Islam.
[10:13:12.635 --> 10:13:13.276]  They're in the right.
[10:13:13.476 --> 10:13:14.657]  I've never been to Russia, folks.
[10:13:14.717 --> 10:13:16.098]  I don't have a drop of Slavic blood in me.
[10:13:16.358 --> 10:13:17.018]  They're in the right!
[10:13:17.279 --> 10:13:19.040]  That woman is the enemy right there!
[10:13:20.502 --> 10:13:29.891]  Trump's a Russian agent because he doesn't want to back radical Muslims blowing up Catholic churches and Orthodox churches.
[10:13:29.991 --> 10:13:31.072]  What the hell?
[10:13:31.392 --> 10:13:32.674]  How far have we fallen?
[10:13:34.081 --> 10:13:39.384]  The Iranians and the Russians didn't start the war, you witch!
[10:13:39.504 --> 10:13:43.847]  Our own military wouldn't go along with it!
[10:13:43.927 --> 10:13:45.748]  By the way, we only got 100,000 of these left.
[10:13:45.788 --> 10:13:46.468]  We had a million.
[10:13:46.848 --> 10:13:50.310]  We got HillaryForPrisonAtInfoWars.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[10:13:50.590 --> 10:13:56.173]  We have these HillaryForPrison shirts that cost $9.95 and 100 of these stickers for $17 to get out to everybody.
[10:13:56.613 --> 10:13:57.674]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[10:13:57.694 --> 10:13:58.574]  Go back to her.
[10:14:04.590 --> 10:14:20.842]  ...and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to frankly gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians, so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict... You can slit every Christian's throat and get more devil power.
[10:14:21.622 --> 10:14:25.165]  More children must die, Hillary, more Christians, or I will take it slow.
[10:14:25.325 --> 10:14:26.206]  I'll do it, Lord.
[10:14:26.406 --> 10:14:27.667]  Who do you want dead?
[10:14:27.907 --> 10:14:30.929]  Kill them in Africa, kill them in the Middle East, kill them in Asia.
[10:14:31.149 --> 10:14:31.850]  Yes, Lord.
[10:14:32.677 --> 10:14:34.361]  ...their return or something like that.
[10:14:34.381 --> 10:14:35.424]  We had muscle.
[10:14:38.493 --> 10:14:42.136]  But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul.
[10:14:42.236 --> 10:14:43.777]  Now we're fighting again to get Mosul.
[10:14:44.457 --> 10:14:51.642]  The problem with Mosul, and what they wanted to do, is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS, who they felt were in Mosul.
[10:14:52.383 --> 10:14:58.627]  About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders, and they're going to attack Mosul.
[10:14:59.188 --> 10:15:01.309]  Whatever happened to the element of surprise?
[10:15:02.030 --> 10:15:02.310]  Okay?
[10:15:02.910 --> 10:15:04.291]  We announced we're going after Mosul.
[10:15:04.311 --> 10:15:07.373]  I've been reading about going after Mosul now for about, how long is it, Hillary?
[10:15:07.393 --> 10:15:07.854]  Three months?
[10:15:08.953 --> 10:15:09.877]  These people have all left.
[10:15:10.961 --> 10:15:11.563]  They've all left.
[10:15:12.355 --> 10:15:13.556]  The element of surprise.
[10:15:14.276 --> 10:15:21.700]  Douglas MacArthur, George Patton, spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country.
[10:15:22.140 --> 10:15:24.261]  So we're now fighting for Mosul that we had.
[10:15:24.281 --> 10:15:25.842]  All she had to do is stay there.
[10:15:26.202 --> 10:15:27.263]  Now we're going in to get it.
[10:15:27.843 --> 10:15:31.385]  But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it?
[10:15:31.445 --> 10:15:35.688]  And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president.
[10:15:36.088 --> 10:15:37.028]  And they want to look tough.
[10:15:37.529 --> 10:15:38.469]  They want to look good.
[10:15:38.949 --> 10:15:41.351]  He violated the red line in the sand.
[10:15:42.211 --> 10:15:43.592]  And he made so many mistakes.
[10:15:43.672 --> 10:15:44.472]  Made all mistakes.
[10:15:44.852 --> 10:15:46.353]  That's why we have the Great Migration.
[10:15:46.973 --> 10:15:48.754]  But she wanted to look good for the election.
[10:15:49.074 --> 10:15:49.795]  So they're going in.
[10:15:50.015 --> 10:15:51.516]  But who's going to get Mosul, really?
[10:15:52.076 --> 10:15:53.216]  We'll take Mosul eventually.
[10:15:53.436 --> 10:15:56.498]  By the way, if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought.
[10:15:56.878 --> 10:15:57.699]  Much, much tougher.
[10:15:57.959 --> 10:15:58.719]  Much more dangerous.
[10:15:58.739 --> 10:16:00.060]  Going to be more deaths than they thought.
[10:16:00.520 --> 10:16:02.441]  But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone.
[10:16:02.861 --> 10:16:03.602]  Because they're smart.
[10:16:04.022 --> 10:16:05.183]  He said, what do we need this for?
[10:16:05.684 --> 10:16:15.753]  So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing, and Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid, the stupidest deal of all time.
[10:16:16.373 --> 10:16:20.437]  A deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons.
[10:16:20.937 --> 10:16:22.499]  Iran should write us yet another letter.
[10:16:22.519 --> 10:16:25.001]  By the way, I know trolls like to bitch, but I'm not going to respond to this.
[10:16:25.161 --> 10:16:27.944]  We have feeds without me talking about it on Infowars.com.
[10:16:27.964 --> 10:16:28.804]  I've said that a hundred times.
[10:16:29.665 --> 10:16:31.446]  And the minority people bitch that I'm talking over the debate.
[10:16:31.746 --> 10:16:34.847]  We have the clean debate at InfoWars.com.
[10:16:34.867 --> 10:16:35.447]  We have the links.
[10:16:35.707 --> 10:16:36.768]  You can watch it all over TV.
[10:16:37.808 --> 10:16:43.770]  See, that's part of the victimology culture, where everybody wants to bitch about something when you can tune into something else.
[10:16:44.270 --> 10:16:48.932]  This is the feed where I'm talking over it because this is what we're doing in live analysis.
[10:16:49.432 --> 10:16:51.753]  We have the right side link, all of it at InfoWars.com.
[10:16:52.628 --> 10:16:55.070]  Okay, so that's how this works.
[10:16:55.110 --> 10:16:58.173]  I mean, it's like people driving in the fast lane, you know.
[10:16:58.513 --> 10:16:59.214]  It's like, do you understand?
[10:16:59.234 --> 10:17:00.215]  This is what you tuned into.
[10:17:00.235 --> 10:17:00.895]  We love you all.
[10:17:01.596 --> 10:17:02.476]  This is what people want.
[10:17:02.877 --> 10:17:03.337]  This is real.
[10:17:03.357 --> 10:17:03.998]  Here we go.
[10:17:04.038 --> 10:17:04.698]  Nobody else does this.
[10:17:05.019 --> 10:17:07.201]  He didn't support the invasion of Iraq.
[10:17:07.361 --> 10:17:08.382]  I said it was a mistake.
[10:17:08.442 --> 10:17:09.362]  I said that years ago.
[10:17:09.422 --> 10:17:13.005]  No, you supported it and massive sanctions that killed a half million Iraqi children.
[10:17:13.246 --> 10:17:14.427]  Again, you're a liar!
[10:17:15.333 --> 10:17:15.593]  I think?
[10:17:36.172 --> 10:17:38.634]  Not told the truth about that position.
[10:17:38.955 --> 10:17:44.460]  I guess he believes it makes him look better now, to contrast with me, because I did vote for it.
[10:17:44.900 --> 10:17:49.144]  But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay.
[10:17:49.564 --> 10:17:51.426]  Mosul is a Sunni city.
[10:17:51.966 --> 10:17:54.348]  Mosul is on the border of Syria.
[10:17:54.989 --> 10:18:00.574]  And yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and just like we went after bin Laden.
[10:18:01.254 --> 10:18:04.816]  Uh, while you were doing Celebrity Apprentice, and we brought him to justice.
[10:18:04.916 --> 10:18:05.857]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:18:05.937 --> 10:18:11.239]  Oh, you brought Bin Laden to justice with the fake killing of Bin Laden while he was doing Celebrity Apprentice.
[10:18:11.299 --> 10:18:13.621]  You were launching wars worldwide trying to take our guns.
[10:18:14.261 --> 10:18:15.962]  We need someone from outside, lady.
[10:18:17.259 --> 10:18:20.280]  Again, for TV viewers and radio listeners, InfoWars.com, where's my show?
[10:18:20.701 --> 10:18:21.381]  Put it back on screen.
[10:18:21.401 --> 10:18:23.082]  These little trolls, they won't stop, though.
[10:18:23.482 --> 10:18:24.102]  People come to keep up.
[10:18:24.122 --> 10:18:25.743]  They're going to get worse now that we responded to them.
[10:18:25.763 --> 10:18:27.084]  I'm showing the whole crew this.
[10:18:27.104 --> 10:18:28.464]  Here's the feed, InfoWars.com.
[10:18:28.484 --> 10:18:31.886]  There's our feed, YouTube feed, another feed, right side feed.
[10:18:31.926 --> 10:18:33.307]  There's the feed without me talking.
[10:18:33.407 --> 10:18:33.747]  See it?
[10:18:34.487 --> 10:18:35.367]  All the other TV channels.
[10:18:35.428 --> 10:18:36.788]  They've got to bitch more now, okay?
[10:18:36.808 --> 10:18:38.129]  They're Hillary supports.
[10:18:38.729 --> 10:18:39.590]  They don't even know they are.
[10:18:39.610 --> 10:18:42.153]  We don't gain anything.
[10:18:42.713 --> 10:18:46.397]  Iran is taking over Iraq.
[10:18:46.417 --> 10:18:52.283]  Hillary has bankrupted our economy.
[10:18:52.883 --> 10:18:54.084]  Hillary has sold out our nation.
[10:18:54.104 --> 10:18:55.386]  Hillary is the past.
[10:18:55.686 --> 10:18:56.967]  She vacations with the Bushes.
[10:18:57.247 --> 10:18:58.168]  We want a change.
[10:18:58.389 --> 10:18:59.810]  We don't want corporate whore media.
[10:18:59.830 --> 10:19:00.270]  We're done.
[10:19:02.031 --> 10:19:04.092]  You know, Wikileaks just actually came out.
[10:19:04.112 --> 10:19:07.534]  John Podesta said some horrible things about you.
[10:19:07.914 --> 10:19:09.114]  And boy, was he right.
[10:19:09.414 --> 10:19:10.415]  He said some beauties.
[10:19:10.455 --> 10:19:11.976]  You don't know what planet you're on.
[10:19:12.756 --> 10:19:14.096]  He said you have bad judgment.
[10:19:14.136 --> 10:19:14.457]  You do.
[10:19:14.757 --> 10:19:22.020]  And if you think that going into Mosul, after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really want...
[10:19:23.180 --> 10:19:26.441]  He said you don't know what planet you're on.
[10:19:26.481 --> 10:19:27.101]  Put it up.
[10:19:27.141 --> 10:19:29.261]  John Podesta said you have terrible instincts.
[10:19:29.821 --> 10:19:32.082]  Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment.
[10:19:32.822 --> 10:19:33.622]  I agree with both.
[10:19:33.842 --> 10:19:43.664]  Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president, and he has said, as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president.
[10:19:43.684 --> 10:19:45.984]  Actually, Joe Stein says you are, starting World War III.
[10:19:46.664 --> 10:19:47.424]  I think he's right.
[10:19:47.864 --> 10:19:50.365]  Let's turn to Aleppo.
[10:19:52.130 --> 10:20:05.753]  Mr. Trump, in the last debate, you were both asked about the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo, and I want to follow up on that because you said several things in that debate which were not true, sir.
[10:20:06.653 --> 10:20:09.114]  You said that Aleppo has basically fallen.
[10:20:09.694 --> 10:20:12.995]  In fact, there are... It's a catastrophe.
[10:20:13.095 --> 10:20:14.015]  It is a catastrophe.
[10:20:14.035 --> 10:20:14.775]  Have you seen it?
[10:20:14.875 --> 10:20:15.776]  Have you seen it?
[10:20:17.472 --> 10:20:19.694]  Sir, have you seen what's happened there?
[10:20:19.714 --> 10:20:20.895]  What the hell?
[10:20:21.015 --> 10:20:22.256]  Okay, so it hasn't fallen.
[10:20:22.296 --> 10:20:22.896]  Take a look at it.
[10:20:22.916 --> 10:20:28.000]  Well, there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being... Well, fallen just means there's no government, you little piece of filth!
[10:20:28.020 --> 10:20:29.401]  Because of bad decisions.
[10:20:30.162 --> 10:20:31.663]  If I may just... What the hell?
[10:20:32.024 --> 10:20:36.887]  And you also said that Syria and Russia are busy...
[10:20:37.848 --> 10:20:38.729]  Fighting ISIS.
[10:20:38.929 --> 10:20:43.012]  In fact, they have been the ones who've been bombing and shelling Eastern Aleppo.
[10:20:43.893 --> 10:20:49.297]  And they just announced a humanitarian pause, in effect, admitting that they have been bombing and shelling Aleppo.
[10:20:49.317 --> 10:20:50.338]  Would you like to clear that up?
[10:20:50.478 --> 10:20:52.140]  Well, Aleppo is a disaster.
[10:20:52.520 --> 10:20:54.962]  It's a humanitarian nightmare.
[10:20:55.723 --> 10:20:58.145]  But it has fallen from any standpoint.
[10:20:58.185 --> 10:21:00.366]  It's like when they told him he wasn't against the Iraq War.
[10:21:00.386 --> 10:21:01.067]  Look at Aleppo.
[10:21:01.247 --> 10:21:03.369]  It is so sad when you see what's happened.
[10:21:04.011 --> 10:21:06.932]  And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton.
[10:21:07.153 --> 10:21:15.597]  Because what's happened is by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad.
[10:21:17.070 --> 10:21:21.233]  He's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama.
[10:21:21.714 --> 10:21:24.316]  And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago.
[10:21:24.596 --> 10:21:26.377]  He aligned with Russia.
[10:21:26.717 --> 10:21:30.640]  He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful.
[10:21:30.980 --> 10:21:33.622]  We gave them $150 billion back.
[10:21:34.082 --> 10:21:37.085]  We give them $1.7 billion in cash.
[10:21:37.445 --> 10:21:40.687]  I mean cash, bundles of cash as big as this stage.
[10:21:41.207 --> 10:21:42.048]  We gave them $1.7 billion.
[10:21:44.930 --> 10:21:47.376]  They have lined, he has aligned with Russia?
[10:21:48.379 --> 10:21:49.000]  And with Iran.
[10:21:49.800 --> 10:21:55.545]  They don't want ISIS, but they have other things because we're backing, we're backing rebels.
[10:21:56.025 --> 10:21:57.286]  We don't know who the rebels are.
[10:21:57.827 --> 10:22:00.949]  We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything.
[10:22:01.390 --> 10:22:03.231]  We don't know who the rebels are.
[10:22:03.732 --> 10:22:13.320]  And when and if, and it's not gonna happen because you have Russia and you have Iran now, but if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy.
[10:22:13.980 --> 10:22:17.083]  But you may very well end up with worse than Assad.
[10:22:18.655 --> 10:22:21.596]  If she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape.
[10:22:22.037 --> 10:22:36.083]  And this is what's caused the Great Migration, where she's taken in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably, in many cases, not probably, who are definitely, in many cases, ISIS-aligned.
[10:22:36.403 --> 10:22:44.747]  And we now have them in our country, and wait till you see, this is going to be the great Trojan horse, and wait till you see what happens in the coming years.
[10:22:45.187 --> 10:22:46.147]  Lots of luck, Hillary.
[10:22:46.347 --> 10:22:47.868]  Thanks a lot for doing a great job.
[10:22:48.672 --> 10:22:58.655]  Secretary Clinton, you have talked about, and in the last debate and again today, that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there.
[10:22:59.035 --> 10:23:04.796]  President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it's going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict.
[10:23:05.276 --> 10:23:10.498]  And General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says you impose a no-fly zone
[10:23:11.218 --> 10:23:16.040]  Chances are you're going to get into a war, his words, with Syria and Russia.
[10:23:16.540 --> 10:23:21.202]  So the question I have is, if you impose a no-fly zone, first of all, how do you respond to their concerns?
[10:23:21.682 --> 10:23:28.325]  Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President Clinton shoot that plane down?
[10:23:28.825 --> 10:23:29.746]  Well, Chris, first of all,
[10:23:31.164 --> 10:23:35.149]  I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict.
[10:23:35.429 --> 10:23:41.336]  I am well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the President and the General.
[10:23:42.337 --> 10:23:45.461]  This would not be done just on the first day.
[10:23:45.581 --> 10:23:50.888]  This would take a lot of negotiation and would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our
[10:23:51.288 --> 10:23:54.672]  The purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.
[10:23:55.193 --> 10:24:02.523]  We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who've been dislocated.
[10:24:02.923 --> 10:24:07.649]  So I think we could strike a deal and come through Turkey to invade Europe.
[10:24:07.669 --> 10:24:08.350]  Because you failed.
[10:24:09.011 --> 10:24:13.234]  This was something that we believe was in the best interest of the people on the ground in Syria.
[10:24:13.314 --> 10:24:14.554]  And he's asked Dunford to attack Russia.
[10:24:14.594 --> 10:24:16.436]  Help us with our fight against ISIS.
[10:24:16.576 --> 10:24:19.638]  But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees.
[10:24:19.718 --> 10:24:21.859]  He's made these claims repeatedly.
[10:24:22.299 --> 10:24:27.923]  I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in.
[10:24:27.943 --> 10:24:29.483]  She said a 500% increase a month ago!
[10:24:29.564 --> 10:24:30.284]  Google it!
[10:24:30.304 --> 10:24:31.405]  She gave a speech!
[10:24:31.425 --> 10:24:31.725]  500% increase!
[10:24:31.805 --> 10:24:32.445]  Pull it up!
[10:24:35.851 --> 10:24:36.851]  Man, she lies, man.
[10:24:36.871 --> 10:24:37.812]  She thinks you're dumb.
[10:24:38.112 --> 10:24:39.232]  ...ambulance is haunting.
[10:24:39.772 --> 10:24:41.173]  And so we are going to... It's haunting.
[10:24:41.293 --> 10:24:42.173]  You started the war.
[10:24:42.213 --> 10:24:43.133]  You started the war.
[10:24:43.173 --> 10:24:44.594]  You started the war five years ago.
[10:24:44.874 --> 10:24:46.735]  You quarterbacked the Secretary of State.
[10:24:46.775 --> 10:24:47.555]  You're a monster.
[10:24:47.595 --> 10:24:48.635]  You quarterbacked Libya.
[10:24:48.875 --> 10:24:49.776]  You ordered the stand-down.
[10:24:49.816 --> 10:24:50.616]  You're a monster.
[10:24:50.636 --> 10:24:52.177]  You're a monster.
[10:24:52.417 --> 10:24:55.858]  ...who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks.
[10:24:56.238 --> 10:24:59.159]  In fact, the killer of the
[10:25:00.728 --> 10:25:07.213]  Dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens.
[10:25:07.293 --> 10:25:10.015]  No, his father was an alarmist and supports you.
[10:25:10.075 --> 10:25:15.239]  Let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.
[10:25:15.259 --> 10:25:15.719]  He loves you.
[10:25:15.779 --> 10:25:22.705]  And yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq and we've got to keep fighting and I will defeat ISIS.
[10:25:22.825 --> 10:25:26.567]  And some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.
[10:25:26.587 --> 10:25:28.229]  Folks, I want to get into our final segment.
[10:25:30.552 --> 10:25:32.314]  She will defeat ISIS.
[10:25:32.655 --> 10:25:34.918]  We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.
[10:25:35.218 --> 10:25:37.261]  And right now they're in 32 countries.
[10:25:37.602 --> 10:25:38.263]  Wait one second.
[10:25:38.623 --> 10:25:41.647]  They had a ceasefire three weeks ago.
[10:25:42.248 --> 10:25:42.769]  A ceasefire.
[10:25:42.809 --> 10:25:44.151]  United States, Russia, Syria.
[10:25:45.276 --> 10:25:49.158]  And during the ceasefire, Russia took over vast swatches of land.
[10:25:49.539 --> 10:25:51.580]  And then they said, we don't want the ceasefire anymore.
[10:25:52.100 --> 10:25:56.483]  We are so outplayed on missiles, on ceasefires.
[10:25:57.003 --> 10:25:58.044]  They are outplayed.
[10:25:58.064 --> 10:25:58.904]  Now, she wasn't there.
[10:25:58.964 --> 10:26:00.465]  I assume she had nothing to do with it.
[10:26:01.005 --> 10:26:07.930]  But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad and, by the way, and by Iran.
[10:26:08.390 --> 10:26:11.652]  Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.
[10:26:11.872 --> 10:26:15.840]  Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, no, I'm going to need to move on to our final segment.
[10:26:15.860 --> 10:26:17.483]  She stole furniture again, did you hear?
[10:26:17.563 --> 10:26:19.426]  Which has not been discussed until tonight.
[10:26:20.788 --> 10:26:22.930]  Our national debt is a share of the economy.
[10:26:22.990 --> 10:26:24.111]  Our GDP is now 77%.
[10:26:24.251 --> 10:26:28.435]  She helped deliver that to make us a better nation for Larry Summers.
[10:26:28.455 --> 10:26:29.516]  Just after World War II.
[10:26:30.096 --> 10:26:40.345]  But the Nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86% of GDP over the next 10 years.
[10:26:40.385 --> 10:26:45.049]  Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105% of GDP over the next 10 years.
[10:26:45.129 --> 10:26:45.950]  That's not true, though.
[10:26:46.030 --> 10:26:47.151]  If you cut taxes, it goes up.
[10:26:47.910 --> 10:26:50.511]  The question is, why are both of you ignoring this problem?
[10:26:50.531 --> 10:26:51.892]  We've already been maneuvered by you!
[10:26:52.032 --> 10:26:52.532]  By you!
[10:26:52.552 --> 10:26:55.753]  No, I said they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs.
[10:26:55.933 --> 10:27:02.296]  And we're bringing GDP from really 1%, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it'll be less than zero.
[10:27:03.196 --> 10:27:08.398]  But we're bringing it from 1% up to 4%, and I actually think we can go higher than 4%.
[10:27:09.138 --> 10:27:10.179]  I think you can go to 5 or 6%.
[10:27:10.219 --> 10:27:11.619]  China's at 10% per decade.
[10:27:13.360 --> 10:27:17.482]  You don't have to bother asking your question because we have a tremendous machine.
[10:27:17.542 --> 10:27:22.585]  We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again.
[10:27:23.125 --> 10:27:24.806]  To do that, we're taking back jobs.
[10:27:24.946 --> 10:27:29.408]  We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs.
[10:27:29.448 --> 10:27:31.469]  We don't make our product anymore.
[10:27:31.489 --> 10:27:34.251]  America can be totally self-sufficient, folks.
[10:27:35.351 --> 10:27:40.137]  The kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of the industry, we used to be there.
[10:27:40.517 --> 10:27:41.318]  We've given it up.
[10:27:41.619 --> 10:27:44.722]  We've become very, very sloppy.
[10:27:45.083 --> 10:27:50.269]  We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies.
[10:27:50.289 --> 10:27:54.114]  You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies.
[10:27:54.674 --> 10:27:59.777]  And yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say.
[10:28:00.297 --> 10:28:01.558]  But we don't use those people.
[10:28:01.598 --> 10:28:04.460]  Those are the people, these are the greatest negotiators in the world.
[10:28:04.500 --> 10:28:06.040]  We have the greatest business people in the world.
[10:28:06.561 --> 10:28:08.742]  We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.
[10:28:09.022 --> 10:28:10.063]  We use political hackers.
[10:28:10.083 --> 10:28:10.443]  I'm so honest.
[10:28:10.703 --> 10:28:15.606]  We use people that get the position because they made a campaign contribution.
[10:28:15.986 --> 10:28:20.168]  And they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are.
[10:28:20.188 --> 10:28:22.389]  So we have to use our great people.
[10:28:23.430 --> 10:28:30.694]  With that being said, we will create an economic machine, the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades.
[10:28:31.054 --> 10:28:32.936]  And people will have a 6% growth rate overnight.
[10:28:32.996 --> 10:28:34.456]  I mean, it just matches the corporate tax.
[10:28:34.677 --> 10:28:40.520]  And they'll make a lot of money, and we'll have companies that will grow and expand and fart from new.
[10:28:41.260 --> 10:28:42.061]  Secretary Clinton.
[10:28:42.455 --> 10:28:51.262]  Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is Make America Great Again, I wonder when he thought America was great.
[10:28:52.123 --> 10:28:53.364]  It's been declining, lady.
[10:28:53.384 --> 10:29:05.474]  And before he rushes and says, you know, before you and President Obama were there, I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades.
[10:29:05.754 --> 10:29:07.896]  Yeah, and that's been good, which is a big sign.
[10:29:08.076 --> 10:29:09.977]  This is the woman that's selling out our country.
[10:29:23.248 --> 10:29:24.890]  He was criticizing President Reagan.
[10:29:24.930 --> 10:29:25.290]  No, he wasn't.
[10:29:25.330 --> 10:29:28.573]  This is the way Donald thinks about himself.
[10:29:28.774 --> 10:29:31.236]  Puts himself into, you know, the middle.
[10:29:31.356 --> 10:29:31.897]  No, he knows bad deals.
[10:29:31.917 --> 10:29:32.437]  He loves America.
[10:29:32.577 --> 10:29:35.420]  I alone can fix it, as he said on the convention stage.
[10:29:36.281 --> 10:29:39.805]  But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris,
[10:29:40.685 --> 10:29:43.427]  I pay for everything I'm proposing.
[10:29:43.587 --> 10:29:46.528]  I do not add a penny to the national budget.
[10:29:46.949 --> 10:29:53.072]  I take that very seriously because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with.
[10:29:53.532 --> 10:30:04.938]  So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs and a lot of the other issues, people talk to me about that.
[10:30:05.298 --> 10:30:06.078]  I've made it very clear.
[10:30:07.039 --> 10:30:07.940]  ...going where the money is.
[10:30:08.020 --> 10:30:12.843]  We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.
[10:30:13.283 --> 10:30:19.507]  And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth.
[10:30:19.587 --> 10:30:21.269]  In fact, I think just the opposite.
[10:30:21.569 --> 10:30:24.171]  We'll have what economists call middle-out growth.
[10:30:24.511 --> 10:30:29.074]  We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America.
[10:30:32.276 --> 10:30:33.357]  I want to invest in you.
[10:30:33.437 --> 10:30:34.918]  I want to invest in your family.
[10:30:35.258 --> 10:30:39.601]  And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer.
[10:30:40.101 --> 10:30:42.263]  And we just have a big disagreement about this.
[10:30:42.343 --> 10:30:44.084]  It may be because of our experiences.
[10:30:44.124 --> 10:30:46.946]  You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire.
[10:30:47.206 --> 10:30:50.488]  I started off with my dad as a small business man.
[10:30:50.568 --> 10:30:57.332]  I think it's, you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.
[10:30:57.352 --> 10:30:58.353]  Could I just respond?
[10:30:58.813 --> 10:30:59.253]  Well, no.
[10:30:59.273 --> 10:31:01.314]  Because I did disagree.
[10:31:01.334 --> 10:31:02.494]  You can't respond.
[10:31:02.534 --> 10:31:03.054]  I disagree.
[10:31:03.074 --> 10:31:03.534]  She's gone.
[10:31:03.594 --> 10:31:03.894]  She's gone.
[10:31:03.914 --> 10:31:06.295]  We should have been much tougher on trade even then.
[10:31:06.555 --> 10:31:07.635]  I've been waiting for years.
[10:31:08.136 --> 10:31:09.076]  Nobody does it right.
[10:31:09.676 --> 10:31:11.316]  And frankly, now we're going to do it right.
[10:31:11.356 --> 10:31:11.636]  All right.
[10:31:12.377 --> 10:31:16.798]  The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver
[10:31:17.618 --> 10:31:22.662]  Of our debt is entitlements, which is 60% of all federal spending.
[10:31:22.682 --> 10:31:28.326]  Now, the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both plans, and they say neither of you has a... That doesn't matter.
[10:31:28.346 --> 10:31:29.526]  87% of our taxes are about to be debt.
[10:31:30.067 --> 10:31:33.329]  Bankers got us just where they want us, and Hillary works for them.
[10:31:33.369 --> 10:31:36.571]  And the big banks have given 100% of their money to Hillary and not Donald.
[10:31:36.631 --> 10:31:39.693]  But we better vote for Hillary, because she'll fix it all!
[10:31:40.074 --> 10:31:41.194]  She cares about us.
[10:31:41.254 --> 10:31:42.575]  ...huge cuts in their benefits.
[10:31:43.816 --> 10:31:51.740]  In effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is... After all the bankers give you money, and you say they're screwing us, Hillary, what the hell?
[10:31:52.180 --> 10:31:59.684]  ...and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements.
[10:31:59.924 --> 10:32:00.825]  I'm cutting taxes.
[10:32:01.085 --> 10:32:02.246]  We're going to grow the economy.
[10:32:02.406 --> 10:32:03.667]  It's going to grow at a record rate.
[10:32:03.687 --> 10:32:04.868]  But that's not going to help us.
[10:32:04.908 --> 10:32:06.329]  No, it's going to totally help us.
[10:32:06.730 --> 10:32:12.634]  And one thing we have to do, repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.
[10:32:12.935 --> 10:32:14.256]  It's destroying our country.
[10:32:14.616 --> 10:32:18.419]  It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses.
[10:32:18.839 --> 10:32:21.922]  We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.
[10:32:22.222 --> 10:32:25.705]  You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in a year.
[10:32:25.845 --> 10:32:28.567]  The plan's bringing something worse, though.
[10:32:28.607 --> 10:32:30.108]  What do you mean, is that evil?
[10:32:44.620 --> 10:32:46.982]  And Secretary Clinton, same question.
[10:32:47.242 --> 10:32:50.064]  Because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out.
[10:32:50.084 --> 10:32:53.065]  The trust funds are going to run out of money.
[10:32:53.085 --> 10:32:54.186]  The WikiLeaks is public.
[10:32:54.206 --> 10:32:56.788]  She wants to bankrupt the economy to take it over.
[10:32:56.808 --> 10:32:57.228]  It's public.
[10:32:57.248 --> 10:32:59.289]  It's cloward and pivot.
[10:32:59.349 --> 10:33:00.350]  We have them.
[10:33:12.978 --> 10:33:13.818]  We have the plan.
[10:33:13.838 --> 10:33:16.700]  Warren Buffett gets the biggest bailout from taxpayers.
[10:33:32.868 --> 10:33:35.590]  As will Donald, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it.
[10:33:36.330 --> 10:33:44.716]  But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund by making sure that we have sufficient resources.
[10:33:45.076 --> 10:33:50.600]  And that will come from either raising the cap and or finding other ways to get more money into it.
[10:33:50.760 --> 10:33:52.121]  I will not cut benefits.
[10:33:53.001 --> 10:34:00.565]  I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current social security system.
[10:34:00.585 --> 10:34:00.685]  Women?
[10:34:00.705 --> 10:34:01.666]  Oh, she loves women.
[10:34:02.066 --> 10:34:10.290]  But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.
[10:34:10.650 --> 10:34:14.452]  That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.
[10:34:14.732 --> 10:34:17.634]  And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal.
[10:34:17.654 --> 10:34:21.916]  The Gang Rape Act, which her own thing says was meant to bankrupt things, to bring in her system?
[10:34:22.116 --> 10:34:22.756]  Trust Fund.
[10:34:23.076 --> 10:34:25.697]  So if he repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse.
[10:34:25.737 --> 10:34:30.599]  What we need to do is go after... They infect the system with a problem too big, make it capitulate.
[10:34:30.739 --> 10:34:32.099]  It's about surrender.
[10:34:32.379 --> 10:34:34.520]  Increase value, emphasize wellness.
[10:34:34.940 --> 10:34:43.023]  I have a plan for doing that, and I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control, but with more resources and smarter decisions.
[10:34:43.043 --> 10:34:47.784]  This is the final time, probably to both of your delights, you're going to be on stage together in this...
[10:34:47.864 --> 10:34:49.545]  Wallace was the least bad, but he's been horrible.
[10:34:49.565 --> 10:34:52.187]  I would like to end it on a positive note.
[10:34:52.267 --> 10:35:01.073]  You had not agreed to closing statements, but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting, because you haven't prepared closing statements.
[10:35:01.294 --> 10:35:11.641]  So I'd like you to take a minute, we're going to put a clock up, a minute, as the final question in the final debate to tell the American people why they should elect you to be the next president.
[10:35:11.681 --> 10:35:13.342]  America, you want more of the past?
[10:35:13.362 --> 10:35:13.822]  Go with her.
[10:35:13.842 --> 10:35:14.463]  You want freedom?
[10:35:14.523 --> 10:35:14.963]  In America?
[10:35:14.983 --> 10:35:15.664]  Go with Donald Trump.
[10:35:16.240 --> 10:35:29.249]  Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans, Democrats, Republicans and Independents, because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be.
[10:35:29.269 --> 10:35:31.771]  Build your economy to make it fairer.
[10:35:32.071 --> 10:35:34.192]  To make it work for everyone.
[10:35:34.533 --> 10:35:38.755]  We need your talents, your skills, your commitment, your energy, your ambition.
[10:35:39.256 --> 10:35:42.358]  You know, I've been privileged to see the presidency up close.
[10:35:42.838 --> 10:35:50.863]  And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you.
[10:35:50.883 --> 10:35:56.807]  I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.
[10:35:57.287 --> 10:35:59.768]  That's what my mission will be in the presidency.
[10:35:59.988 --> 10:36:04.971]  I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations.
[10:36:05.171 --> 10:36:13.935]  I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college.
[10:36:14.315 --> 10:36:17.337]  I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.
[10:36:17.957 --> 10:36:19.277]  Secretary Clinton, thank you.
[10:36:19.578 --> 10:36:20.098]  Mr. Trump?
[10:36:20.697 --> 10:36:24.318]  She's raising the money from the people she wants to control.
[10:36:24.339 --> 10:36:25.539]  It doesn't work that way.
[10:36:25.859 --> 10:36:29.060]  But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly.
[10:36:29.120 --> 10:36:31.581]  It's called Make America Great Again.
[10:36:32.022 --> 10:36:33.262]  We're going to make America great.
[10:36:33.302 --> 10:36:34.763]  We have a depleted military.
[10:36:35.083 --> 10:36:35.863]  It has to be helped.
[10:36:35.883 --> 10:36:36.744]  It has to be fixed.
[10:36:36.784 --> 10:36:39.025]  We have the greatest people on Earth in our military.
[10:36:39.425 --> 10:36:40.705]  We don't take care of our veterans.
[10:36:40.765 --> 10:36:45.787]  We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets.
[10:36:46.388 --> 10:36:47.128]  That can't happen.
[10:36:47.688 --> 10:36:50.490]  Our policemen and women are disrespected.
[10:36:51.171 --> 10:36:53.492]  We need law and order, but we need justice, too.
[10:36:53.993 --> 10:36:56.014]  Our inner cities are a disaster.
[10:36:56.395 --> 10:36:58.216]  You get shot walking to the store.
[10:36:58.476 --> 10:36:59.517]  They have no education.
[10:36:59.537 --> 10:37:00.357]  They have no jobs.
[10:37:00.518 --> 10:37:06.042]  I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in ten lifetimes.
[10:37:06.362 --> 10:37:10.345]  All she's done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos.
[10:37:10.845 --> 10:37:12.527]  But they get the vote, and then they come back.
[10:37:12.547 --> 10:37:13.908]  They say, we'll see you in four years.
[10:37:13.948 --> 10:37:14.448]  She's the past.
[10:37:14.628 --> 10:37:20.873]  We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now.
[10:37:21.193 --> 10:37:26.637]  We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her.
[10:37:27.337 --> 10:37:27.577]  Yes!
[10:37:27.697 --> 10:37:28.238]  Thank you both.
[10:37:29.750 --> 10:37:32.291]  Secretary Clinton, hold on just a moment folks.
[10:37:32.331 --> 10:37:37.973]  Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, I want to thank you both for participating in all three of these debates.
[10:37:38.013 --> 10:37:42.014]  That brings to an end this year's debate sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
[10:37:42.574 --> 10:37:46.376]  We want to thank the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and its students for having us.
[10:37:47.176 --> 10:37:49.097]  Now, the decision is up to you.
[10:37:49.697 --> 10:37:54.178]  While millions have already voted on Election Day, November 8th is just 20 days away.
[10:37:54.878 --> 10:37:58.239]  One thing everyone here can agree on, we hope you will go vote.
[10:37:58.779 --> 10:38:02.320]  It is one of the honors and obligations of living in this great country.
[10:38:02.340 --> 10:38:04.781]  One thing we can hope for is we're going to expose election fraud.
[10:38:05.962 --> 10:38:07.242]  We hope the mainstream media dies.
[10:38:10.694 --> 10:38:11.414]  There goes Hillary.
[10:38:11.574 --> 10:38:13.855]  God, that woman is so demonic, so full of herself.
[10:38:14.515 --> 10:38:15.556]  Look at her creeping over.
[10:38:15.576 --> 10:38:16.836]  Look at this video.
[10:38:16.856 --> 10:38:20.537]  Look at that joker face.
[10:38:22.358 --> 10:38:23.138]  Oh, look at the demon.
[10:38:24.339 --> 10:38:27.180]  She tried last week to do that thing where she reaches out with a nut and shake his hand.
[10:38:27.200 --> 10:38:28.080]  I wonder if she'll try it again.
[10:38:30.401 --> 10:38:31.261]  Leering demon.
[10:38:32.361 --> 10:38:33.642]  Trump took on a lot doing this.
[10:38:43.499 --> 10:38:44.740]  Well, I'll tell you this, folks.
[10:38:45.441 --> 10:38:47.624]  Trump isn't perfect, neither am I, but he's an Americana.
[10:38:47.924 --> 10:38:54.332]  We've done one-sided deals where if they just make our corporate tax the same as the average, then we'll have a 5% growth rate.
[10:38:54.772 --> 10:38:58.436]  You cut our taxes to match other countries, we'll have a 7-8% growth rate.
[10:38:59.277 --> 10:39:00.999]  The globalists want a consolidated system.
[10:39:01.019 --> 10:39:01.800]  Trump doesn't want that.
[10:39:01.820 --> 10:39:02.901]  He's so honest, he goes,
[10:39:03.562 --> 10:39:07.743]  Yeah, of course I buy my shirts in Mexico because they're $5 cheaper or $10 cheaper.
[10:39:08.023 --> 10:39:08.483]  We do too.
[10:39:08.783 --> 10:39:10.343]  We buy American-made, nobody buys them.
[10:39:10.383 --> 10:39:11.243]  They want the cheaper shirt.
[10:39:11.703 --> 10:39:14.344]  He says, we'll make a fairer deal, then it'll happen.
[10:39:16.144 --> 10:39:17.324]  But he will do deals with everybody.
[10:39:17.925 --> 10:39:27.366]  It's just that globalism, America was this big super-rich country, and these elites used our wealth to buy off all these other countries, but not to even empower their nations.
[10:39:27.746 --> 10:39:30.607]  That was the promise to consolidate control.
[10:39:31.827 --> 10:39:32.748]  Hillary made it through.
[10:39:32.768 --> 10:39:35.750]  She looks completely drugged up, as Donald Trump has said.
[10:39:35.770 --> 10:39:38.653]  But I say she looks a lot better than she did when she was collapsing and all the rest of it.
[10:39:39.874 --> 10:39:42.536]  I want to bring Leanne McAdoo and whoever wants to come in here.
[10:39:42.896 --> 10:39:44.778]  David Knight's out there in Vegas covering this.
[10:39:45.238 --> 10:39:46.419]  We've got three studios here.
[10:39:46.439 --> 10:39:48.681]  I want to open the phones up, take phone calls.
[10:39:48.701 --> 10:39:52.604]  I'm going to get out of here in about 20 minutes, because I already did four hours today in the last few hours.
[10:39:52.624 --> 10:39:54.146]  I've got to get some sleep.
[10:39:54.186 --> 10:39:56.067]  My kids are probably already about to go to bed.
[10:39:57.441 --> 10:40:02.084]  Man, I tell you, Hillary Clinton wants you poor, wants you dumb, wants you under her control.
[10:40:02.124 --> 10:40:04.365]  She's very public about that.
[10:40:07.935 --> 10:40:18.746]  When you look at what she's done in Haiti, and then the blood scandal, and everything she's done, and the way she would sit there and just say to Trump things that weren't true, when you're informed, it's nauseating.
[10:40:18.766 --> 10:40:21.129]  That's why we do this feed where I talk over it and commentary.
[10:40:21.149 --> 10:40:25.313]  That's why we have the other feeds that are clean for folks on Infowars.com.
[10:40:25.353 --> 10:40:27.695]  But we're going to open the phones up here in a moment.
[10:40:29.250 --> 10:40:30.250]  I'll get that toll-free number.
[10:40:30.271 --> 10:40:31.432]  We have our own phone system here.
[10:40:31.492 --> 10:40:34.614]  We had 23,000 calls a week and a half ago at the last debate.
[10:40:34.675 --> 10:40:38.218]  I want to sit here with the crew and take some phone calls and see what you have to say.
[10:40:38.258 --> 10:40:43.523]  But I want to air, because it's so powerful, again here for a moment, this Nigel Farage interview.
[10:40:43.543 --> 10:40:44.483]  It's about four minutes long.
[10:40:44.824 --> 10:40:45.725]  We've got like 20 more minutes.
[10:40:45.745 --> 10:40:48.007]  It's going to air tomorrow during the radio show, 11 a.m.
[10:40:48.047 --> 10:40:48.527]  to 3 p.m.
[10:40:48.547 --> 10:40:49.028]  on the premiere.
[10:40:49.548 --> 10:40:55.809]  You know, the full interview, but this is him talking about winning and nationalism and how this is just the first phase in this fight.
[10:40:55.829 --> 10:41:04.051]  But I tell you, the dogged determination of Trump, his will, the things he's gone through, all the things that have happened, it has been epic.
[10:41:04.992 --> 10:41:07.292]  It has been truly, truly amazing.
[10:41:07.512 --> 10:41:18.715]  And I never really signed on to a campaign like this before, but when I saw the whole power structure and the communist Chinese that make Hitler look like an amateur, I mean, you know, he was evil, but my God, an amateur.
[10:41:19.659 --> 10:41:22.961]  And I see the Saudi Arabians and the Catholic Church run by the Jesuits.
[10:41:22.981 --> 10:41:23.882]  They're totally evil.
[10:41:24.542 --> 10:41:26.743]  Overriding the Catholic Church is what it actually stood for.
[10:41:26.763 --> 10:41:29.125]  I've seen the Catholic Church do some good things in history.
[10:41:29.145 --> 10:41:31.066]  It's certainly overturned by evil now.
[10:41:31.767 --> 10:41:38.211]  I see all this happening and I just say to myself, my God, these are incredible times to be alive right now.
[10:41:39.073 --> 10:41:43.455]  So, I want to air this short Nigel Farage interview, the first part that David Knight got.
[10:41:43.775 --> 10:41:45.996]  This is the guy that got the UK to leave the EU.
[10:41:46.476 --> 10:42:04.422]  It isn't over yet, the fight's just begun, but as he said, the more we resist the fact that multinationals are taking over our country, they can't just play this game like we're all dumb and Hillary says, it's a conspiracy theory that I got money from Saudi Arabia or China, or it's a conspiracy theory that, you know, the moon comes up sometimes, or it's a conspiracy theory that 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[10:42:04.822 --> 10:42:06.643]  It doesn't work at a certain point.
[10:42:08.752 --> 10:42:13.414]  So we do have Roger Stone here to give us breaking analysis.
[10:42:13.774 --> 10:42:17.075]  I tried to call Roger tonight, but he was on a show.
[10:42:17.555 --> 10:42:21.257]  They tried to keep Danny Williams and Obama's brother from speaking.
[10:42:21.697 --> 10:42:23.217]  We had to change it to another venue.
[10:42:23.257 --> 10:42:25.378]  We called around and found out where they were at.
[10:42:25.618 --> 10:42:28.059]  I think Trump did A+.
[10:42:28.419 --> 10:42:29.980]  He got a 99 last debate.
[10:42:30.000 --> 10:42:33.081]  I gave him a 95 for this one, but I think it was a crushing defeat.
[10:42:33.441 --> 10:42:35.482]  The media will claim he obviously lost, but
[10:42:36.502 --> 10:42:37.883]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[10:42:37.923 --> 10:42:39.263]  Roger Stone, what are you saying right now?
[10:42:40.304 --> 10:42:41.584]  His best debate of the three.
[10:42:41.604 --> 10:42:44.066]  He aged it in the closing.
[10:42:45.086 --> 10:42:50.949]  The expectations, of course, for him were probably low, mostly set by the mainstream media.
[10:42:51.969 --> 10:42:54.870]  And he is, as I said last week, very much in the hunt.
[10:42:55.171 --> 10:42:57.232]  This is still a competitive race.
[10:42:58.472 --> 10:43:02.334]  But he now can regalvanize his campaign.
[10:43:03.797 --> 10:43:06.758]  The mainstream media harping on him isn't going to stop.
[10:43:07.779 --> 10:43:08.879]  But it's being ineffective.
[10:43:09.019 --> 10:43:09.899]  It's just not working.
[10:43:09.959 --> 10:43:11.580]  Well sure, let me stop you.
[10:43:11.640 --> 10:43:13.261]  I think last debate was even better.
[10:43:14.201 --> 10:43:15.461]  Tell me, I respect you.
[10:43:15.501 --> 10:43:16.602]  You always tell me what you really think.
[10:43:16.942 --> 10:43:18.102]  Why was this one even better?
[10:43:18.142 --> 10:43:19.843]  Correct me where I'm wrong.
[10:43:20.783 --> 10:43:24.324]  Well, first of all, we didn't have the distraction of that sniff that we somehow had.
[10:43:24.344 --> 10:43:26.145]  I don't know if we had a post-nasal jerk.
[10:43:26.165 --> 10:43:27.125]  Sure, sure.
[10:43:27.145 --> 10:43:28.726]  He was snorting a bit.
[10:43:29.606 --> 10:43:31.187]  That was a little distracting, I thought.
[10:43:31.775 --> 10:43:37.560]  He was more positive, and his closing particularly was strong.
[10:43:38.021 --> 10:43:39.642]  He did have a heavy gravitas.
[10:43:39.682 --> 10:43:41.043]  He seemed extremely confident.
[10:43:41.924 --> 10:43:43.666]  Yeah, he seemed like the President of the United States.
[10:43:43.746 --> 10:43:46.568]  Precisely what he is as the chief executive job he's running for.
[10:43:48.390 --> 10:43:52.073]  I mean, listening to Hillary, everything she said was a lie.
[10:43:52.153 --> 10:43:54.956]  I mean, what do you think Hillary's thinking right now?
[10:43:56.391 --> 10:43:58.652]  I mean, her whole thing is wearing very, very thin.
[10:43:58.712 --> 10:44:01.052]  Her public record on issues is absurd.
[10:44:01.332 --> 10:44:05.533]  The entire Russian meme is getting tired.
[10:44:05.573 --> 10:44:13.455]  Look, we would not have been able, the Russians would not be able to have her emails if she hadn't used an unsecure, illegal server.
[10:44:14.215 --> 10:44:22.417]  So, it's like... Sure, but I have William Binney, not just on air, but off record and others, saying they know this actually isn't the Russians.
[10:44:22.457 --> 10:44:23.737]  This is patriots in the US.
[10:44:24.955 --> 10:44:37.380]  Yeah, there's no evidence that it's the Russians, and the idea that 16 political appointees in the Obama administration say otherwise, the ranking Republicans on the Senate Intelligence Committee have not, foolishly, have not demanded proof.
[10:44:38.800 --> 10:44:43.822]  You know, this whole meme is getting very old, and Trump nailed it repeatedly.
[10:44:44.934 --> 10:44:46.035]  There's just no evidence of that.
[10:44:46.075 --> 10:44:47.577]  It could be the Russians, it could be the Chinese.
[10:44:47.597 --> 10:44:50.679]  But I mean, personally, like Trump said six months ago, I don't care.
[10:44:50.719 --> 10:44:51.440]  Release the emails.
[10:44:51.660 --> 10:44:54.802]  If they're committing crimes, I don't care if the Easter Bunny delivers it.
[10:44:56.204 --> 10:45:03.429]  Well, as you know, the idea is to distract from the content of the disclosures by getting everybody whipped up about how they got leaked.
[10:45:03.449 --> 10:45:05.091]  Let's talk about the disclosures.
[10:45:05.131 --> 10:45:07.573]  I mean, you two weeks ago, you checked me.
[10:45:07.613 --> 10:45:08.033]  You were right.
[10:45:08.073 --> 10:45:08.834]  I was freaking out.
[10:45:09.134 --> 10:45:09.895]  They hadn't released it.
[10:45:11.716 --> 10:45:15.937]  The mainstream media efforts to stifle all of it, pretend it doesn't exist, is not working because the
[10:45:41.596 --> 10:45:47.760]  The charges themselves are so extraordinary, so devastating, that they are, in fact, newsworthy.
[10:45:49.962 --> 10:45:53.905]  Roger, I'm always asking the question, spend a few minutes on whatever you think is front and center right now.
[10:45:55.566 --> 10:46:02.711]  Well, I mean, look, this was, this, I think, had the greatest single effect, which is to turn Trump's money back on.
[10:46:02.811 --> 10:46:05.073]  I know that the campaign undertook
[10:46:06.019 --> 10:46:10.567]  Which is a giant plus that all the big money people don't give him money.
[10:46:10.587 --> 10:46:11.629]  I mean, that's a total endorsement.
[10:46:19.822 --> 10:46:27.048]  Well, and it means, of course, that there's no danger whatsoever that he can be controlled or manipulated after he's president.
[10:46:27.088 --> 10:46:31.291]  This is his great appeal, that he is, you can't buy him and you can't bully him.
[10:46:31.331 --> 10:46:32.312]  He's not for sale.
[10:46:32.792 --> 10:46:35.234]  He doesn't dance to the tune of any special interest.
[10:46:35.314 --> 10:46:36.735]  I think that's his greatest asset.
[10:46:37.235 --> 10:46:41.679]  This, talking to some of the money people immediately after the debate, they're very, very encouraged.
[10:46:41.739 --> 10:46:47.203]  People who didn't want to give days ago are now calling saying that they have reconsidered their position.
[10:46:47.783 --> 10:46:51.488]  So I think he's bringing, you know, new energy in his campaign for the close.
[10:46:51.508 --> 10:46:54.993]  I mean, this is the Trump I know.
[10:46:55.073 --> 10:46:58.878]  The guy is a clutch player, and he always performs under pressure.
[10:46:59.519 --> 10:47:00.881]  And he really came through tonight.
[10:47:00.941 --> 10:47:05.107]  I mean, talking to his people in South Carolina, talking to his people in New York, they are ebullient tonight.
[10:47:06.058 --> 10:47:07.178]  No, they were nervous.
[10:47:07.239 --> 10:47:08.839]  No, I agree, it was a big victory.
[10:47:08.859 --> 10:47:18.363]  It was just after that first defeat, I guess I'm a little bit biased because that was such a victory when he came back, but I agree, this was very presidential, very well done.
[10:47:20.284 --> 10:47:23.265]  I think, if they're being honest, this pushes him ahead in the polls.
[10:47:24.366 --> 10:47:25.186]  What do you see happening?
[10:47:26.400 --> 10:47:28.822]  Yeah, I think he now closes whatever gap existed.
[10:47:28.902 --> 10:47:32.865]  What's interesting, if you look at the internals, he continues to lead in Ohio.
[10:47:33.305 --> 10:47:34.566]  He heads up in Florida.
[10:47:34.586 --> 10:47:36.227]  I think he's still ahead in North Carolina.
[10:47:36.687 --> 10:47:39.750]  He's still up by a surprisingly large margin in Iowa.
[10:47:40.370 --> 10:47:52.339]  So, you know, the Sunshine Patriots, the screaming meanies who were ready to kill themselves last week because they believe the mainstream media esteem that this was over, this isn't over until we say it is.
[10:47:53.513 --> 10:47:54.614]  Yeah, we do the hanging.
[10:47:54.835 --> 10:47:55.355]  Oh, I know.
[10:47:55.816 --> 10:47:58.779]  Mainstream media, totally discredited, 6% trust rate.
[10:47:59.360 --> 10:48:03.524]  I mean, having them endorse you is the signal, the signature of death.
[10:48:04.045 --> 10:48:06.808]  I mean, who cares if they say you're discredited?
[10:48:07.148 --> 10:48:08.910]  This isn't about that anymore and I think...
[10:48:09.671 --> 10:48:15.353]  The Bushes and others are having their last gasp right now trying to suffocate Trump Nation.
[10:48:15.573 --> 10:48:20.715]  Again, Trump's not perfect, I'm not perfect, you're not perfect, but this is a referendum on mainstream media.
[10:48:21.215 --> 10:48:23.496]  Their ratings, I track it weekly.
[10:48:23.996 --> 10:48:28.878]  As you know, Roger, CNN's average show had about 112,000 viewers a month ago.
[10:48:29.178 --> 10:48:30.398]  It's now like 72,000.
[10:48:31.398 --> 10:48:33.159]  They are flatlining, man.
[10:48:33.519 --> 10:48:34.940]  They have killed themselves.
[10:48:35.240 --> 10:48:38.981]  Fox, I believe, is now going the same way, only a matter of time before they are
[10:48:39.441 --> 10:48:40.601]  Yeah, so they're flatlining.
[10:48:40.641 --> 10:48:41.021]  What is that?
[10:48:41.061 --> 10:48:46.663]  I mean, right now, I don't want to brag to people, but, I mean, we've got like 3 million people on streams right now without even promoting it.
[10:48:47.023 --> 10:48:49.103]  This is unconventional warfare.
[10:48:49.463 --> 10:48:54.465]  What do they do when, like, right side of the night had like 5 million people?
[10:48:54.765 --> 10:48:56.125]  We have Facebook mentions.
[10:48:56.165 --> 10:48:57.165]  This is side issues.
[10:48:57.185 --> 10:49:00.446]  Now it's 600,000 viewers outside of our 3 million.
[10:49:00.766 --> 10:49:04.467]  I mean, we could, like, fall off a frickin' side of a road.
[10:49:04.507 --> 10:49:05.547]  We'd have 5 million viewers.
[10:49:05.847 --> 10:49:07.328]  These people are a joke, brother.
[10:49:07.388 --> 10:49:07.908]  What are they gonna do?
[10:49:09.648 --> 10:49:14.111]  Well, that's because, of course, you are interesting, your broadcast is interesting, and they're informative.
[10:49:14.631 --> 10:49:18.133]  These guys at CNN, Fox, are carrying PAP.
[10:49:18.733 --> 10:49:29.379]  I've now heard that the personnel at Newsmax have been ordered not to discuss Bill's women, Broderick, Willie, Jones, the fact that he's a serial rapist and that Hillary has threatened those women.
[10:49:29.580 --> 10:49:31.080]  Oh yeah, the word's out on that.
[10:49:31.301 --> 10:49:33.002]  We have satellite feeds being cut.
[10:49:33.062 --> 10:49:36.964]  If you mention WikiLeaks or Bill Clinton, right, they are cutting satellite feeds.
[10:49:40.103 --> 10:49:47.366]  Yeah, I think you've got a, you have an entire process of censorship.
[10:49:47.666 --> 10:49:55.048]  But this doesn't, correct me if I'm wrong, this doesn't signify strength, this signifies crapping your diaper is weakness.
[10:49:56.869 --> 10:49:59.710]  Hold on one second.
[10:50:01.911 --> 10:50:04.672]  I think that they're, you know, the mainstream media just has it, they're done.
[10:50:06.027 --> 10:50:06.507]  They're finished.
[10:50:06.867 --> 10:50:07.448]  And they know it.
[10:50:07.568 --> 10:50:14.490]  And that's why they're so hysterical as they... And by the way, we don't... Listen, Stone... I love Stone.
[10:50:14.530 --> 10:50:15.150]  He's just like me.
[10:50:15.190 --> 10:50:15.950]  I mean, it's true.
[10:50:16.451 --> 10:50:17.451]  I tell you what I really think.
[10:50:17.511 --> 10:50:18.851]  If we're losing, I'll tell you we're losing.
[10:50:19.291 --> 10:50:22.313]  Okay, I don't sit up here like they do and say, oh, we're winning, we're winning, when they're not.
[10:50:22.673 --> 10:50:24.473]  They are being routed right now.
[10:50:24.493 --> 10:50:27.394]  They are being flagrantly destroyed.
[10:50:27.514 --> 10:50:28.355]  Correct, Stone?
[10:50:29.195 --> 10:50:35.417]  Yeah, particularly when you consider the conservative viewer who is unhappy with the changes in
[10:50:36.334 --> 10:50:38.756]  Roger Stone of StoneCultures.com.
[10:50:38.796 --> 10:50:39.797]  You told me a month ago.
[10:50:59.193 --> 10:51:01.336]  You said, get ready for your audience to get even bigger.
[10:51:01.376 --> 10:51:02.057]  And I said, why?
[10:51:02.517 --> 10:51:04.840]  And you said, well, the numbers show I don't really follow it.
[10:51:05.121 --> 10:51:07.243]  They're deserting Fox, which has been taken over in a coup.
[10:51:07.704 --> 10:51:12.069]  And all I know is we've gone from, like, doubling our viewers last year to, like, tripling the last month.
[10:51:12.350 --> 10:51:13.211]  So you called that.
[10:51:13.431 --> 10:51:15.714]  There is a huge exodus right now.
[10:51:15.774 --> 10:51:16.355]  It's very sad.
[10:51:18.692 --> 10:51:28.198]  No, look, I think it's very good for InfoWars.com because, frankly, you're picking up those viewers who are looking for facts, who are looking for the truth, and aren't looking for the establishment lying.
[10:51:29.159 --> 10:51:30.380]  We're hurtling towards war.
[10:51:30.440 --> 10:51:39.546]  That was the one disappointment I did have tonight, is that there's no discussion of the fact that Obama and Hillary are trying to take us to war with the Russians over Syria, if that's what they have to do.
[10:51:39.646 --> 10:51:42.688]  Oh, she said, we want this no-fly zone, which means shooting that Russian aircraft.
[10:51:43.569 --> 10:51:44.769]  Yeah, crazy.
[10:51:44.970 --> 10:51:46.050]  That is insanity.
[10:51:46.130 --> 10:51:48.372]  That is just a suicide impulse.
[10:51:49.605 --> 10:51:52.286]  All right, I've asked the questions for 20 minutes and I've got to go to another interview.
[10:51:52.306 --> 10:51:53.327]  You've got five minutes, Stone.
[10:51:53.607 --> 10:51:54.067]  Take over.
[10:51:54.107 --> 10:51:54.928]  What's most important?
[10:51:54.968 --> 10:51:56.228]  Former head of the Trump campaign.
[10:51:56.989 --> 10:51:57.529]  What's happening?
[10:51:57.549 --> 10:51:59.170]  We're seeing a real Donald Trump.
[10:51:59.350 --> 10:52:07.394]  We need to focus, as Trump himself has said recent days, to the fact that when the establishment's back is put to the wall, they will try to steal this election.
[10:52:08.127 --> 10:52:14.009]  It is not just voter fraud, although that's an issue, it is also rigging of the electronic machines.
[10:52:14.109 --> 10:52:17.271]  So again, I urge people to go to StopTheSteal.org.
[10:52:17.791 --> 10:52:23.953]  Sign up as a volunteer for our exit poll program, which we're going to be unveiling shortly.
[10:52:24.433 --> 10:52:29.375]  Over 1,200 patriots have already signed up to work on Election Day in shifts.
[10:52:29.415 --> 10:52:31.736]  So right now we can cover about 600 precincts.
[10:52:32.436 --> 10:52:33.157]  We have about
[10:52:34.437 --> 10:52:42.441]  5,000 precincts in places where we think the theft would take place because of one-party government, entire one-party government.
[10:52:42.501 --> 10:52:55.228]  So I urge folks to go to StopTheSteal.org, sign up as a volunteer, send us $25 and help us conduct exit polls that allow us to compare them with machine results to see if this election is on the up and up or not.
[10:52:55.488 --> 10:52:59.090]  And by the way, let me briefly, I'm a student of body language as I get older.
[10:52:59.810 --> 10:53:04.313]  Since you mentioned this, I've been watching CNN, MSNBC, when they talk about Roger Stone.
[10:53:04.734 --> 10:53:07.776]  I don't know if you're watching TV, I don't really watch either, but I see the boil downs.
[10:53:08.216 --> 10:53:17.042]  They are, like, scared of you, but they're like, Trump and Stone and Alex Jones say that there's a fraud and they've got election poll watchers and this is racist, this is horrible.
[10:53:17.282 --> 10:53:23.306]  They are so scared of us showing these buses and vans, telling the same people point to point.
[10:53:23.386 --> 10:53:25.388]  They are crapping their pants right now.
[10:53:26.778 --> 10:53:30.920]  Exactly right, which is why I have now been banned on both CNN and MSNBC.
[10:53:30.940 --> 10:53:35.703]  So the police can assault me as a Russian agent, which is of course a canard.
[10:53:35.743 --> 10:53:39.245]  I have a piece up on Breitbart right now in which I lay that out.
[10:53:40.766 --> 10:53:43.288]  But they don't give me a chance to respond.
[10:53:43.328 --> 10:53:45.069]  That's not journalism, that's bias.
[10:53:46.052 --> 10:53:54.515]  Hey, when they call me, they say the underwear bombers did it because of Alex Jones, and they don't even show why, and I call MSNBC and they don't even call me back.
[10:53:54.535 --> 10:53:56.176]  It's like, you just accused me.
[10:53:56.196 --> 10:53:59.437]  My lawyer said I could win the suit, but it would take a million dollars, you know, in years.
[10:53:59.497 --> 10:53:59.957]  I didn't do it.
[10:54:00.377 --> 10:54:04.479]  It's like, wow, I'm the, I'm now the Boston bomber with no proof?
[10:54:04.739 --> 10:54:06.179]  I mean, what the hell?
[10:54:06.519 --> 10:54:07.580]  Why not say I'm the
[10:54:08.578 --> 10:54:10.959]  Who was the guy that killed women in England 200 years ago?
[10:54:12.060 --> 10:54:13.620]  I'm the Jack the Ripper.
[10:54:13.680 --> 10:54:14.781]  I'm the Jack the Ripper!
[10:54:14.841 --> 10:54:16.562]  I mean, what level is this?
[10:54:16.582 --> 10:54:17.922]  Because let me tell you what it scares me.
[10:54:17.942 --> 10:54:20.643]  It has to do with your long-standing belief in UFOs.
[10:54:20.723 --> 10:54:22.564]  These guys are completely irresponsible.
[10:54:22.584 --> 10:54:26.626]  They twist what you really say to try to make a weak case.
[10:54:27.246 --> 10:54:30.228]  But the rotting, teetering establishment is going down and they know it.
[10:54:30.308 --> 10:54:31.808]  That's why they're so hysterical.
[10:54:32.089 --> 10:54:33.089]  By the way, that's not hype.
[10:54:33.109 --> 10:54:34.109]  So let me ask you this question.
[10:54:34.570 --> 10:54:36.150]  They admit they want to censor us now.
[10:54:36.190 --> 10:54:36.971]  They want to come after us.
[10:54:38.292 --> 10:54:39.314]  How does this play out?
[10:54:39.354 --> 10:54:45.142]  Because, I'm going to be honest, I look at the videos of our own crew tonight when they were trying to cancel the press conference with Danny Williams and the rest of it.
[10:54:45.722 --> 10:54:48.266]  They've really got some sloppy operatives.
[10:54:48.346 --> 10:54:52.191]  I mean, I don't mean to be so elitistly, because I don't want to underestimate the enemy.
[10:54:52.692 --> 10:54:55.576]  They've got some real dumbasses working for them, Roger.
[10:54:56.809 --> 10:55:02.831]  Well, not only that, but these recent James O'Keefe revelations are extraordinary.
[10:55:03.252 --> 10:55:05.232]  They boast openly about stealing votes.
[10:55:05.272 --> 10:55:07.273]  They boast openly about breaking the law.
[10:55:07.313 --> 10:55:09.674]  They boast openly about smearing me.
[10:55:09.694 --> 10:55:12.776]  They say, no one will stop us stealing it.
[10:55:12.816 --> 10:55:13.576]  We're invincible.
[10:55:15.137 --> 10:55:16.297]  Yeah, it's really extraordinary.
[10:55:16.597 --> 10:55:17.798]  It's really quite extraordinary.
[10:55:17.878 --> 10:55:20.139]  Alex, I've got to roll, but thank you very much for having me.
[10:55:20.519 --> 10:55:22.560]  I've got to go, but in closing, what does this signify?
[10:55:22.580 --> 10:55:23.400]  A big win for Trump?
[10:55:24.212 --> 10:55:25.012]  Big win for Trump.
[10:55:25.052 --> 10:55:25.772]  We're in the hunt.
[10:55:25.992 --> 10:55:26.613]  We're in the hunt.
[10:55:26.633 --> 10:55:27.713]  We just got to keep fighting.
[10:55:27.933 --> 10:55:28.933]  Victory or death.
[10:55:29.273 --> 10:55:30.454]  Alright, there goes Roger Stone.
[10:55:30.954 --> 10:55:32.074]  I want to play a clip.
[10:55:32.534 --> 10:55:36.475]  I want to bring in reporters and talk about this and take your phone calls.
[10:55:37.035 --> 10:55:38.656]  I'm going to punch up the phone system.
[10:55:38.696 --> 10:55:39.436]  Now, here's the problem.
[10:55:40.576 --> 10:55:43.857]  The phone system launches 20 callers at a time.
[10:55:44.857 --> 10:55:45.457]  It's digital.
[10:55:45.658 --> 10:55:46.818]  It's not like other talk radio.
[10:55:47.827 --> 10:55:51.770]  The problem is we get thousands of calls every few minutes.
[10:55:52.711 --> 10:55:57.294]  So just who you are, where you're calling from, and we'll put you on air.
[10:55:57.334 --> 10:55:58.896]  We don't need to have a big long conversation.
[10:55:58.976 --> 10:55:59.756]  I love you to death.
[10:56:00.277 --> 10:56:01.197]  I'm being condescending.
[10:56:02.218 --> 10:56:02.418]  It's 877-789-2539.
[10:56:02.438 --> 10:56:02.518]  877-789-2539.
[10:56:02.538 --> 10:56:05.661]  We've got to answer your call, get your name, where you're calling from.
[10:56:12.873 --> 10:56:19.300]  So, have a good phone, don't be too drunk, we'll take your phone call.
[10:56:19.320 --> 10:56:24.505]  877-789-2539 is our in-house phone number to take your phone calls and respond to what we just saw.
[10:56:24.525 --> 10:56:32.012]  Now we'll have LeeAnn McAdoo and Rob Dew and all the rest of the crew in here to break down what's happening and unfolding.
[10:56:32.833 --> 10:56:35.115]  But this is a historic event we've just witnessed.
[10:56:36.132 --> 10:56:42.516]  I mean, they tried at CNN to go into the main convention center and shut down the Danny Williams press conference, but so much press showed up they had to shut down.
[10:56:42.937 --> 10:56:44.418]  I mean, they are desperate, folks.
[10:56:46.019 --> 10:56:46.879]  They are so desperate.
[10:56:47.780 --> 10:56:47.860]  Us.
[10:56:47.880 --> 10:56:47.920]  877-789-2539.
[10:56:48.260 --> 10:56:50.362]  We got 23,000 calls last week during this coverage.
[10:56:50.382 --> 10:56:55.425]  Now, briefly, if you think getting 23,000 phone calls is cheap, if you think
[10:57:04.485 --> 10:57:09.087]  Three million people with different IPs tuning in so far to this is cheap.
[10:57:09.447 --> 10:57:10.447]  I got a bridge I want to sell you.
[10:57:10.687 --> 10:57:11.708]  And I'm not bitching about it.
[10:57:12.188 --> 10:57:15.989]  Just realize you're part of history right now and funding this is key.
[10:57:16.390 --> 10:57:25.633]  We have free shipping on non-GMO seeds, shirts, books, videos, water filters, shower filters, incredible nootropics like BrainForce, SuperMetal Vitality.
[10:57:25.693 --> 10:57:29.735]  Oh my God, you owe SuperMetal Vitality to your daily life.
[10:57:30.635 --> 10:57:33.336]  We've got Living Defense Harmful Organism Cleanser.
[10:57:33.356 --> 10:57:39.138]  We've got the best nootropic brain force system out there.
[10:57:39.178 --> 10:57:45.320]  We've got the amazing knockout that the same amount of melatonin that's in each big horse pill
[10:57:47.112 --> 10:58:02.889]  They sell it for $19, the average competitor, when we have the same dose plus eight other ingredients like L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, boom, boom, boom, and this acid that's in there, some kind of acid, the scientists tell me, that makes you absorb the thing.
[10:58:03.650 --> 10:58:05.471]  It's like, I'm gonna sell you something for 19 bucks.
[10:58:05.491 --> 10:58:09.033]  I'm gonna put the acid in it to make sure you... I don't mean the yellow acid.
[10:58:09.053 --> 10:58:11.674]  I mean another type of acid to make you absorb the stuff.
[10:58:12.454 --> 10:58:14.355]  All I know is you want deep, vivid dreams.
[10:58:14.435 --> 10:58:15.075]  It works for me.
[10:58:15.496 --> 10:58:16.736]  Infowarslife.com.
[10:58:17.517 --> 10:58:18.517]  Free shipping right now.
[10:58:18.577 --> 10:58:19.798]  It funds the whole operation.
[10:58:20.118 --> 10:58:21.959]  This is historical, what's happening right now.
[10:58:22.859 --> 10:58:24.861]  So I see like 20 phone lines loaded.
[10:58:24.881 --> 10:58:26.882]  Your phone calls are coming up.
[10:58:26.922 --> 10:58:29.584]  Just give us your name, where or not where you're calling from.
[10:58:29.925 --> 10:58:30.745]  They're all over the world.
[10:58:31.326 --> 10:58:39.633]  But I want to air Nigel Farage, the head of UKIP, 25 years ago founded in, you know, his basement in London.
[10:58:40.333 --> 10:58:42.494]  Today, the fastest growing party in Europe.
[10:58:43.254 --> 10:58:45.315]  It's not even UKIP, it just means UK Independence.
[10:58:45.655 --> 10:58:46.955]  They got 25 countries joining.
[10:58:46.995 --> 10:58:47.756]  They all want to get out.
[10:58:47.976 --> 10:58:48.776]  They all want sovereignty.
[10:58:48.816 --> 10:58:51.637]  They all want to have their laws made by centralized globalists.
[10:58:52.017 --> 10:58:53.778]  This is history happening.
[10:58:54.978 --> 10:58:56.719]  As people take an action just like you.
[10:58:57.739 --> 10:59:00.100]  It's a very exciting point to be alive right now.
[10:59:00.120 --> 10:59:04.602]  So let's go to that report, then I'll come back with our reporters, your phone calls, and more.
[10:59:04.982 --> 10:59:05.742]  I'm Alex Jones.
[10:59:05.802 --> 10:59:07.063]  This is the InfoWar.
[10:59:09.016 --> 10:59:13.323]  Americanism, not globalism will be our credo!
[10:59:15.967 --> 10:59:17.971]  Americanism, not globalism!
[10:59:20.640 --> 10:59:22.001]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Farage.
[10:59:22.662 --> 10:59:23.883]  Americans have seen a lot of clips.
[10:59:23.903 --> 10:59:25.565]  We know what an effective speaker you are.
[10:59:25.605 --> 10:59:31.732]  We know what a fearless speaker you are, going right to the seat of power and taking them on, speaking truth to them.
[10:59:32.052 --> 10:59:36.097]  I want to ask you what Donald Trump needs to do in this final debate tonight.
[10:59:36.117 --> 10:59:38.719]  You see, I think that in the first debate
[10:59:39.648 --> 10:59:40.548]  She had the better of him.
[10:59:41.829 --> 10:59:43.189]  And that's down to experience.
[10:59:44.050 --> 10:59:46.631]  He was stepping up to a level that he'd never been at before.
[10:59:46.971 --> 10:59:47.691]  I've been there myself.
[10:59:48.611 --> 11:00:05.578]  I've done these big debates and I know that when you're somewhat virginal, going into these things, well we can call Trump virginal perhaps as a matter of conjecture, but when you're going into these things, and you've never done them before, they're tough, but I felt at the end of the second debate, he completely dominated.
[11:00:06.278 --> 11:00:11.159]  He didn't just dominate her, he dominated the people doing the debates with the moderators.
[11:00:11.199 --> 11:00:15.281]  He understood he was in a 3 against 1 situation and he called him out on it.
[11:00:15.641 --> 11:00:15.901]  And he did.
[11:00:15.981 --> 11:00:16.801]  And he was right to do so.
[11:00:17.021 --> 11:00:21.682]  So I think psychologically, he comes to Las Vegas with the upper hand.
[11:00:22.382 --> 11:00:25.323]  She's going to be very nervous going into this tonight.
[11:00:25.943 --> 11:00:27.104]  She's going to play very safe.
[11:00:28.824 --> 11:00:33.345]  And I think he will go in and look for the knockout blow.
[11:00:33.965 --> 11:00:35.405]  Let's talk to the voters for a second.
[11:00:35.805 --> 11:00:43.427]  But when I look at what you did in England, it reminds me of William Wilberforce, the guy who ended slavery virtually single-handedly.
[11:00:43.447 --> 11:00:48.468]  It's what you did when you went to the European Union and you said, we're going to get Britain out of the European Union.
[11:00:49.228 --> 11:00:56.229]  William Wilberforce, for his entire life, took on the moneyed interests, the multinational corporations that were involved in free trade.
[11:00:56.869 --> 11:00:58.130]  Free trade of slaves.
[11:00:58.771 --> 11:01:00.512]  And so he stopped that slavery.
[11:01:00.552 --> 11:01:01.933]  It took him an entire lifetime to do it.
[11:01:01.953 --> 11:01:05.636]  The final vote to outlaw slavery occurred shortly after he died.
[11:01:05.697 --> 11:01:07.638]  So this is a long-term movement.
[11:01:08.199 --> 11:01:10.941]  We can go straight to the seat of power.
[11:01:10.981 --> 11:01:12.162]  William Wilberforce has shown that.
[11:01:12.502 --> 11:01:15.245]  You showed that to us in Britain with Brexit.
[11:01:15.305 --> 11:01:18.187]  We can take them on directly and we can win.
[11:01:18.247 --> 11:01:19.088]  It's a long-term game.
[11:01:19.108 --> 11:01:20.109]  They've been in it for a long term.
[11:01:20.809 --> 11:01:27.534]  This is a movement, this is what we see being started here in America behind Trump, and it's a movement that you started with Brexit as well.
[11:01:28.114 --> 11:01:31.937]  Yes, and don't think that this is just America and Britain.
[11:01:32.417 --> 11:01:49.088]  This is actually happening across a lot of Europe as well, and very important that we remember that we've got people in France, and Germany, and Hungary, and Italy, and everywhere you go now, people are saying, you know, the global elite have led us very badly, the rich have got richer, the poor have got poorer, this simply isn't working.
[11:01:49.128 --> 11:01:50.409]  And one thing I would say,
[11:01:51.189 --> 11:01:58.914]  Is, you know, whatever happens here on November the 8th, American politics is never going to be the same again.
[11:01:59.134 --> 11:01:59.515]  That's right.
[11:02:00.215 --> 11:02:01.816]  It simply can't be, because you're right.
[11:02:02.637 --> 11:02:05.779]  Actually, I mean, Trump's not a Republican candidate.
[11:02:05.999 --> 11:02:06.739]  He's an independent.
[11:02:06.980 --> 11:02:07.120]  Yeah.
[11:02:07.320 --> 11:02:08.400]  He's taken over the party.
[11:02:08.440 --> 11:02:09.121]  He is now.
[11:02:09.141 --> 11:02:10.902]  You're the one standing in front of him.
[11:02:10.962 --> 11:02:12.903]  You know, and everyone's run away from him.
[11:02:13.604 --> 11:02:14.925]  He's effectively an independent.
[11:02:15.105 --> 11:02:17.927]  Now, if he wins, he wins, and America changes course.
[11:02:18.707 --> 11:02:19.548]  But if he doesn't win,
[11:02:20.467 --> 11:02:26.108]  If the establishment win this time, that is not the end of this story.
[11:02:26.388 --> 11:02:31.750]  Because all those people that will have been motivated to stand up and do something, they're not going to go away.
[11:02:31.770 --> 11:02:33.250]  They're not going to disappear.
[11:02:33.990 --> 11:02:39.531]  So, yeah, I think ultimately, you know, we've toppled the establishment in the United Kingdom.
[11:02:39.571 --> 11:02:41.492]  It took us a very, very long time.
[11:02:42.112 --> 11:02:44.914]  And a whole number of false starts, but we've done it.
[11:02:45.035 --> 11:02:47.597]  And I think that is going to happen in the USA.
[11:02:47.617 --> 11:02:50.559]  It's just a question of whether it's this year or whether you have to wait a bit.
[11:02:51.019 --> 11:03:06.352]  I think we need to sort of start getting the ghosts of Thatcher and Reagan going on the small man and small woman who want to take risk, set up their own little businesses, and who ultimately create real wealth.
[11:03:07.052 --> 11:03:09.214]  Within the economy and create real jobs.
[11:03:09.254 --> 11:03:11.936]  And that is the opportunity that we now have.
[11:03:12.616 --> 11:03:13.757]  We voted for Brexit.
[11:03:14.077 --> 11:03:16.579]  Yeah, sure, it's going to take us two or three years to sort it all out.
[11:03:16.939 --> 11:03:24.985]  But we've now got a chance to move back towards a genuine capitalist system where people have got a chance of succeeding.
[11:03:25.205 --> 11:03:28.588]  And that, I think, didn't you guys used to call this the American dream?
[11:03:28.939 --> 11:03:29.299]  That's right.
[11:03:29.539 --> 11:03:31.240]  And we used to call it a Declaration of Independence.
[11:03:31.260 --> 11:03:37.822]  We said we're going to take back our freedom, our property, and our self-governance from a small globalist cabal.
[11:03:38.342 --> 11:03:48.405]  I would just finish by saying that whatever happens tonight in this big showdown in Vegas, there's a couple of weeks of full campaigning left.
[11:03:49.145 --> 11:03:56.768]  And what the Trump campaign need to do is to try and get a national conversation going on the very things you and I have just talked about for the last three minutes.
[11:04:00.680 --> 11:04:01.661]  It's live coverage.
[11:04:01.961 --> 11:04:03.863]  The debate just ended in the last 15 minutes.
[11:04:03.923 --> 11:04:07.908]  Margaret Howell, one of our co-hosts and reporters, is with us right now.
[11:04:07.988 --> 11:04:09.850]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[11:04:11.698 --> 11:04:17.680]  You know, I am so honored to know Nigel Farage, and I don't want credit, but I want listeners who are new.
[11:04:17.700 --> 11:04:25.142]  That's why I promote right-side broadcasting that's brand new, and I promote drugs that's old but cutting edge still, because we're all in this together.
[11:04:25.862 --> 11:04:28.543]  I remember interviewing Nigel Farage like 18, 19 years ago.
[11:04:31.364 --> 11:04:39.507]  His party only had one seat in Parliament, a couple of local seats, but he was like patriotic, libertarian, anti-EU, anti-New World Order, I would have him on.
[11:04:40.147 --> 11:04:44.509]  And Farage, I'm not bragging, it's not about us getting credits, it's about the power of the show, the listeners.
[11:04:45.902 --> 11:04:55.957]  Last time he was on, actually live about a month ago, he said, you know, I would go out to knock on doors once you confronted Groin 15 years ago and most of the people said I heard about you on Alex Jones.
[11:04:56.378 --> 11:05:01.185]  So how we had free internet and a big show that was popular in England, the Paul Watson and stuff that helped.
[11:05:01.906 --> 11:05:11.810]  That reached out and we were part of pushing Brexit, they're part of pushing us to get Trump, and we're just all connected for national sovereignty, Margaret.
[11:05:12.150 --> 11:05:28.016]  Alex, look, you were the tip of the spear then, you're the tip of the spear now, and what we're seeing here, so in pushing Brexit forward, all we can hope is that we're doing our part, we're doing enough in this fight, and watching this debate, you know, sitting at that table tonight amongst reporters,
[11:05:28.576 --> 11:05:29.076]  I don't know.
[11:05:43.684 --> 11:05:48.805]  We've gotten so far off the course of this, and people need to understand we are in a fight for our lives here.
[11:05:48.885 --> 11:05:51.306]  This is Americanism versus Globalism.
[11:05:51.366 --> 11:05:52.346]  It's as simple as that.
[11:05:52.826 --> 11:06:03.829]  And if you don't want to be controlled, if you don't want your kids and your grandkids sold down the river, if you don't want to be, you know, practicing Christianity in secret, if you want to have a prosperous home, this decision is very clear for people.
[11:06:04.489 --> 11:06:09.334]  And, you know, Nigel, I have so much respect for him and the person that he is and what he's done for his own country.
[11:06:09.774 --> 11:06:13.818]  You have that opportunity to do that now, and I'm very encouraged watching this debate tonight.
[11:06:13.838 --> 11:06:15.620]  You know, there wasn't really a hard hit anywhere.
[11:06:16.100 --> 11:06:16.981]  We were waiting for that.
[11:06:17.021 --> 11:06:18.402]  We were waiting for him to punch her in the gut.
[11:06:18.422 --> 11:06:18.803]  No, I agree.
[11:06:18.823 --> 11:06:20.925]  The last one was better, but overall he won.
[11:06:20.965 --> 11:06:26.330]  But do I agree with Nigel, or do I agree with, like, Stone, that this was a bigger victory?
[11:06:26.710 --> 11:06:28.572]  I don't really think it was, but it was overall a victory.
[11:06:28.992 --> 11:06:40.878]  You know, listening to commentators and people coming out of this, so, we were waiting for the hard hit, it didn't happen, but overall he did win that debate because when you hit somebody with truth... He came off as very loving.
[11:06:41.018 --> 11:06:41.598]  Exactly.
[11:06:41.638 --> 11:06:44.419]  Compassionate, but at the same time, right.
[11:06:45.040 --> 11:06:47.861]  And he was right on every... Well, can't we just have the same corporate tax as China?
[11:06:48.421 --> 11:06:53.604]  Like, you know, it's just, you know, they got a 35% tariff on us on currency.
[11:06:54.144 --> 11:06:57.166]  Leave us, God, you know, what did we do?
[11:06:58.606 --> 11:07:04.152]  Going back to China, Alex, so China gave Bill Clinton a million dollars to give a speech in Memphis, Tennessee.
[11:07:04.172 --> 11:07:05.474]  This is kind of unknown, you know.
[11:07:05.494 --> 11:07:08.657]  I'm just looking at the company responsible for... Who is he propping up?
[11:07:08.677 --> 11:07:10.319]  Yeah, we're not asking for something special.
[11:07:10.359 --> 11:07:14.763]  Just don't like... I don't know about Mexico a lot because I've studied their economy.
[11:07:15.104 --> 11:07:17.606]  If they weren't being screwed over, they'd be probably richer than us.
[11:07:18.267 --> 11:07:19.689]  We are all being screwed by this.
[11:07:20.069 --> 11:07:20.889]  No, there's a question.
[11:07:20.969 --> 11:07:22.190]  And you know what she's going to do?
[11:07:22.250 --> 11:07:25.070]  So we already know that China owns a lot of us already.
[11:07:25.430 --> 11:07:29.692]  You just wait until this crazy devil gets in office.
[11:07:29.712 --> 11:07:31.012]  We are going to be bought and sold.
[11:07:31.052 --> 11:07:31.392]  Well, that's it.
[11:07:31.412 --> 11:07:34.093]  They admit, just like terrible countries, they want us poor.
[11:07:34.173 --> 11:07:35.013]  They know that.
[11:07:35.273 --> 11:07:36.553]  We're like, you're making us poor.
[11:07:36.653 --> 11:07:37.494]  Of course we are.
[11:07:37.734 --> 11:07:38.634]  That's the plan.
[11:07:38.674 --> 11:07:39.554]  He distracts us.
[11:07:39.814 --> 11:07:40.594]  It's a distraction.
[11:07:40.614 --> 11:07:42.155]  Like we think make people wealthy.
[11:07:42.215 --> 11:07:42.615]  No, no, no.
[11:07:43.115 --> 11:07:44.257]  No, no, no, no, exactly.
[11:07:44.297 --> 11:07:50.504]  So, we know that Trump, with all, so the boisterousness of Trump, and I was talking to some friends, you know, they're on the fence about this, and people are tweeting us.
[11:07:50.885 --> 11:07:53.668]  They really, there are really people on the fence still, I can't believe it.
[11:07:54.129 --> 11:07:56.231]  But they're saying, you know what, what about this, what do you say about it?
[11:07:56.452 --> 11:07:58.354]  Look, he wants you prosperous.
[11:07:58.394 --> 11:07:59.475]  He's not perfect.
[11:07:59.515 --> 11:08:01.057]  The problem is he's not calculatable.
[11:08:01.077 --> 11:08:01.538]  That's good.
[11:08:02.178 --> 11:08:02.639]  Exactly.
[11:08:02.719 --> 11:08:05.401]  I mean, he's not, he never even, he got drafted to do this.
[11:08:05.441 --> 11:08:07.363]  So Margaret Howell, let me ask you this.
[11:08:08.004 --> 11:08:11.147]  Watching this though, I mean, he's ahead in internal polls.
[11:08:11.687 --> 11:08:12.868]  That's why he was saying it's rigged.
[11:08:13.229 --> 11:08:14.230]  They're moving forward.
[11:08:14.510 --> 11:08:16.332]  Hillary looked like she was doped up on something.
[11:08:16.352 --> 11:08:21.256]  I mean, I'm just being honest, but she performed better than even she did before, sitting on the stool.
[11:08:21.797 --> 11:08:24.279]  What does your gut tell you who wins in 18 days?
[11:08:25.940 --> 11:08:33.305]  So, obviously our hope and our prayer is that, you know, our country wins here and that Trump succeeds and that Americanism triumphs over globalism.
[11:08:33.345 --> 11:08:40.050]  That's honestly where this is going and I have to put my hope behind that to be able to function and get up and do this and do this fight every day.
[11:08:40.610 --> 11:08:44.012]  But look, Gallup has her ahead 9 percentage points.
[11:08:44.492 --> 11:08:48.475]  If you recall, Gallup in 1988 had Dukakis ahead by 17 points.
[11:08:48.595 --> 11:08:52.538]  It doesn't mean a damn here and we're looking at these distorted polls.
[11:08:52.558 --> 11:08:52.858]  They're all
[11:08:52.898 --> 11:08:54.599]  They had more Democrats in the search, yeah.
[11:08:54.639 --> 11:08:55.120]  There you go.
[11:08:55.220 --> 11:08:57.842]  So, you know, forget the polls right now.
[11:08:57.982 --> 11:08:59.023]  And people are coming out.
[11:08:59.063 --> 11:08:59.863]  We know this, Alex.
[11:09:00.184 --> 11:09:03.666]  You put us on the ground in Trump rallies and in Trump places where he is.
[11:09:03.987 --> 11:09:04.987]  It's standing room only.
[11:09:05.007 --> 11:09:07.389]  She's got 30 weird people off to the sidelines.
[11:09:07.409 --> 11:09:11.833]  That was a strong point when he said, because it's in the WikiLeaks, you sent people to disrupt the rallies.
[11:09:11.893 --> 11:09:12.693]  Oh, there's no question.
[11:09:12.753 --> 11:09:13.514]  He gets it.
[11:09:13.554 --> 11:09:13.974]  He gets it.
[11:09:13.994 --> 11:09:14.655]  Of course she did.
[11:09:14.695 --> 11:09:17.077]  That horrible little man, Scott, whatever the
[11:09:17.998 --> 11:09:20.020]  Let me ask you this question.
[11:09:20.060 --> 11:09:28.450]  What do you make of these Project Veritas videos with the head of the Democratic Party's get-out-the-vote group saying, we're going to steal the election.
[11:09:28.470 --> 11:09:29.591]  It doesn't matter.
[11:09:29.631 --> 11:09:31.253]  We control the police and government.
[11:09:31.693 --> 11:09:33.495]  We're having people vote ten times apiece.
[11:09:34.557 --> 11:09:35.677]  It's on video.
[11:09:36.297 --> 11:09:38.418]  By any means necessary, that's what they're saying.
[11:09:38.458 --> 11:09:42.119]  By any means necessary, they're going to take this from you directly.
[11:09:42.139 --> 11:09:45.059]  It doesn't matter who they have to kill, hurt, or maim, they're going to do it.
[11:09:45.519 --> 11:09:46.760]  And Trump got it tonight.
[11:09:47.080 --> 11:09:49.500]  He understands they're paying the homeless and the disabled.
[11:09:49.540 --> 11:09:54.021]  It reminds me of what Soros said when he said about the Catholics, you know, useful idiots.
[11:09:54.301 --> 11:09:58.582]  That's exactly what they're doing to these poor people that maybe have a disability, that they're homeless.
[11:09:58.622 --> 11:09:59.763]  I agree with you.
[11:09:59.803 --> 11:10:00.923]  Listen, in my whole life,
[11:10:02.307 --> 11:10:14.236]  I don't like behind the scenes, like, I've been around a few liberals and that's when I heard racist stuff, like as an icebreaker, it's like some little special thing, they'll go, would you like some inward toes?
[11:10:14.876 --> 11:10:18.158]  And this happened to me, the high-level Democrat, I said, what's that?
[11:10:18.198 --> 11:10:21.681]  He goes, it's these, it's these, it's these beans.
[11:10:21.781 --> 11:10:25.063]  It's like some kind of, I think it's like a Brazilian nut or something.
[11:10:25.143 --> 11:10:28.206]  And I'm like, uh, and I was thinking back to my life where they would like,
[11:10:28.826 --> 11:10:30.987]  Get behind closed doors and go, I hate these n-words.
[11:10:31.027 --> 11:10:33.467]  And I would always think, what the hell is this person saying?
[11:10:33.507 --> 11:10:34.228]  Is this some test?
[11:10:34.288 --> 11:10:36.288]  And go, no, I hate, I hate everybody.
[11:10:36.908 --> 11:10:40.109]  And that's what I'm getting at is, I'm not, like, I'm some goody two-shoe.
[11:10:40.169 --> 11:10:44.170]  I don't even want to say I'm not racist because that ties into serving them, but I'm not.
[11:10:44.190 --> 11:10:46.411]  I just want prosperity, everybody to be happy.
[11:10:46.831 --> 11:10:52.093]  And then I'm sitting there in my whole life growing up in Texas, never heard racist talk except when I was around Democrats.
[11:10:52.913 --> 11:10:54.315]  And then I know Hillary.
[11:10:54.355 --> 11:10:55.396]  I've had her chef on.
[11:10:55.696 --> 11:10:56.877]  I've had her bodyguards on.
[11:10:57.318 --> 11:10:59.240]  She literally hates black people.
[11:10:59.540 --> 11:11:00.581]  She hates Mexicans.
[11:11:00.961 --> 11:11:03.124]  She hates everybody, for that matter.
[11:11:03.164 --> 11:11:06.267]  But she, like, if you're rich and powerful, she'll kiss your ass.
[11:11:06.347 --> 11:11:10.471]  Whether you're a Muslim or an American or black or white, she'll kiss your ass.
[11:11:10.772 --> 11:11:12.013]  But she hates little people.
[11:11:12.333 --> 11:11:13.574]  That's what the Secret Service has told her.
[11:11:13.594 --> 11:11:16.855]  She said, well, we don't want to call her racist because she calls Mexicans names.
[11:11:17.315 --> 11:11:18.315]  She calls blacks names.
[11:11:18.495 --> 11:11:19.496]  She calls whites names.
[11:11:19.756 --> 11:11:20.736]  They're trying to be so honest.
[11:11:20.776 --> 11:11:22.057]  I'm like, exactly.
[11:11:22.117 --> 11:11:23.737]  She hates common, normal people.
[11:11:23.757 --> 11:11:24.698]  She has a food chain.
[11:11:25.158 --> 11:11:26.198]  The woman's got a food chain.
[11:11:26.218 --> 11:11:27.179]  We know this from her email.
[11:11:27.219 --> 11:11:33.021]  She has at the top, she has people that literally she can excavate from their pockets.
[11:11:33.041 --> 11:11:36.922]  The bottom of the food chain, it doesn't matter if you're black or Hispanic or white, whatever you are.
[11:11:37.002 --> 11:11:38.463]  She has that fundamental disdain.
[11:11:38.803 --> 11:11:39.684]  She absolutely does.
[11:11:39.704 --> 11:11:42.666]  And look, look no further than what Barack... What's wrong with her?
[11:11:42.726 --> 11:11:46.149]  How do you, like, just go around hating poor people?
[11:11:46.429 --> 11:11:47.710]  They're an inconvenience to her.
[11:11:47.730 --> 11:11:49.131]  I feel guilty for poor people.
[11:11:49.171 --> 11:11:50.432]  I want to... I don't know.
[11:11:50.492 --> 11:11:51.012]  I hate them.
[11:11:51.052 --> 11:11:51.533]  I don't get it.
[11:11:51.953 --> 11:11:54.415]  You see what the ghetto is doing in this country.
[11:11:54.455 --> 11:11:57.497]  The ghetto is where, you know, the hardest hit in this country.
[11:11:57.537 --> 11:12:00.620]  So under Barack Obama, our ghettos have gotten worse.
[11:12:01.781 --> 11:12:03.362]  78% rise on the... Way bigger, yeah.
[11:12:03.462 --> 11:12:04.865]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[11:12:04.885 --> 11:12:06.989]  So we're seeing poverty like we've never seen before.
[11:12:07.169 --> 11:12:12.600]  One in four American children go to bed hungry every single night, and yet her answer to this?
[11:12:14.892 --> 11:12:18.013]  Well that's the thing is, how do you have this much evil energy?
[11:12:18.073 --> 11:12:24.636]  Because I mean I'm not like some wimp, I'm not some goody two-shoes, but how do you hate people that are in your control?
[11:12:25.297 --> 11:12:29.619]  Like I hate people trying to dominate me, I don't hate people that are like below me.
[11:12:29.639 --> 11:12:34.401]  No, it's a unique, there's something about the love of money, it really is the root of all, this woman,
[11:12:35.121 --> 11:12:38.843]  There's something in her where it's the only thing that matters.
[11:12:39.344 --> 11:12:40.204]  Lives don't matter.
[11:12:40.284 --> 11:12:41.165]  People don't matter.
[11:12:41.185 --> 11:12:41.625]  No, exactly.
[11:12:41.685 --> 11:12:43.766]  It came out she stole George Washington's plates and stuff.
[11:12:43.786 --> 11:12:44.627]  People say, you didn't see?
[11:12:44.647 --> 11:12:48.569]  In Wikileaks, she stole whole State Department buildings of furniture.
[11:12:48.929 --> 11:12:49.469]  Disgusting.
[11:12:49.549 --> 11:12:50.670]  Like, what is that?
[11:12:50.710 --> 11:12:52.071]  Like, the grasping just...
[11:12:53.223 --> 11:12:54.004]  It doesn't matter.
[11:12:54.024 --> 11:12:54.886]  It doesn't matter.
[11:12:54.906 --> 11:12:56.809]  It's her act of power.
[11:12:57.089 --> 11:12:57.490]  Exactly.
[11:12:57.751 --> 11:12:59.514]  She's stealing people's futures, though, Alex.
[11:12:59.554 --> 11:13:01.557]  That's what... I mean, the plates.
[11:13:01.617 --> 11:13:02.499]  Let her have the plates.
[11:13:02.539 --> 11:13:03.701]  Just don't take our futures.
[11:13:03.721 --> 11:13:04.662]  Don't take our kids' futures.
[11:13:04.682 --> 11:13:06.385]  But the thing is, she's got to steal everything.
[11:13:07.714 --> 11:13:08.034]  I agree.
[11:13:08.134 --> 11:13:09.115]  I know, it's disgusting.
[11:13:09.135 --> 11:13:10.456]  Well, I don't get that psychology.
[11:13:10.496 --> 11:13:11.456]  So what is the psychology?
[11:13:12.097 --> 11:13:17.320]  You're at the White House, you steal the plates, the furniture, you're at the State Department, you steal the furniture and the plates?
[11:13:17.380 --> 11:13:18.041]  What do you do with them?
[11:13:18.221 --> 11:13:18.801]  That's what I've heard.
[11:13:19.101 --> 11:13:24.525]  She's got mansions all over the country, like McCain's, like 20 mansions they admit, and they're just full of crap.
[11:13:24.825 --> 11:13:27.727]  And you go to these mansions, there's just stacks of stolen stuff.
[11:13:28.267 --> 11:13:29.208]  What the hell?
[11:13:29.668 --> 11:13:30.890]  What the hell is that?
[11:13:30.930 --> 11:13:31.830]  He's a Jezebel.
[11:13:31.850 --> 11:13:35.053]  So she's got this Ahab Jezebel scenario in the White Ivory Tower.
[11:13:35.093 --> 11:13:37.035]  History repeating itself all over again.
[11:13:37.075 --> 11:13:40.037]  It's only up to us to keep Jezebel from coming back on the Earth.
[11:13:40.057 --> 11:13:42.940]  So how do you counter somebody that will start World War III to steal more stuff?
[11:13:43.100 --> 11:13:44.761]  Look, with the truth, it's as simple as that.
[11:13:44.781 --> 11:13:45.861]  You know, people aren't stupid.
[11:13:45.981 --> 11:13:46.981]  People aren't stupid.
[11:13:47.001 --> 11:13:50.983]  That's what I found in my four and a half years of doing this on the air, getting up every day.
[11:13:51.003 --> 11:13:54.124]  Right, you've been on the air in L.A., you've been on the air internationally.
[11:13:54.144 --> 11:13:55.544]  Eastern Europe, Western Europe, the Middle East.
[11:13:55.924 --> 11:13:57.405]  You just tell people the truth.
[11:13:57.545 --> 11:13:58.705]  It is so plain and simple.
[11:13:58.745 --> 11:14:00.166]  Just, we're telling you the truth.
[11:14:00.186 --> 11:14:00.946]  There's no spin.
[11:14:01.306 --> 11:14:01.906]  We're tired.
[11:14:02.146 --> 11:14:03.187]  We've been doing this all day.
[11:14:03.407 --> 11:14:06.308]  But the bottom line is, we want you to understand this woman hates you.
[11:14:06.328 --> 11:14:07.048]  I'm ready to die.
[11:14:08.068 --> 11:14:09.329]  I mean, I don't say that as some power trip.
[11:14:09.429 --> 11:14:11.350]  I'm sick of these people.
[11:14:11.370 --> 11:14:12.310]  I want to see them pay.
[11:14:12.915 --> 11:14:13.315]  I do, too.
[11:14:13.335 --> 11:14:14.056]  I do, too.
[11:14:14.516 --> 11:14:18.598]  But more importantly than the vengeance on her, I just don't want her to steal our prosperity.
[11:14:19.019 --> 11:14:19.579]  I just don't.
[11:14:19.659 --> 11:14:20.159]  Well, that's it.
[11:14:20.199 --> 11:14:20.800]  She hates us.
[11:14:20.820 --> 11:14:23.241]  I don't want her to steal anything more than she's already taken.
[11:14:23.541 --> 11:14:24.962]  Well, Margaret Howell, I want to go to phone calls.
[11:14:24.982 --> 11:14:26.023]  We need to ride shotgun with us.
[11:14:26.083 --> 11:14:27.423]  And we got Leanne and them filing reports.
[11:14:27.443 --> 11:14:28.024]  They're going to come in.
[11:14:28.044 --> 11:14:29.945]  We're going to go for as long as the crew wants to go tonight.
[11:14:29.965 --> 11:14:32.666]  But the thing is, we're not on some high horse.
[11:14:32.706 --> 11:14:35.308]  It's not like we're acting like we're these great moral people.
[11:14:35.668 --> 11:14:36.609]  We have consciousness.
[11:14:36.649 --> 11:14:38.009]  We feel guilty for stuff we do.
[11:14:38.029 --> 11:14:38.730]  We're not perfect.
[11:14:39.070 --> 11:14:40.131]  But I just don't get
[11:14:40.991 --> 11:14:47.716]  Like, just the media is throwing themselves at Hillary and, like, doubling her donations.
[11:14:47.736 --> 11:14:48.636]  They give her money.
[11:14:48.696 --> 11:14:49.797]  They worship her.
[11:14:49.857 --> 11:14:57.902]  They... I mean, I wouldn't worship... I wouldn't worship... I don't mean to be gross if you're a lady, but I wouldn't worship dog shit out in the street.
[11:14:58.303 --> 11:15:04.227]  I mean, obviously, I'd delay that for radio audiences to be clicked at, but, I mean, why do they worship her?
[11:15:05.186 --> 11:15:09.512]  There is an incestual, it's almost like a perverse relationship.
[11:15:09.552 --> 11:15:15.260]  There is a seduction that's happening between the two of them and it's a weird incestual thing.
[11:15:15.340 --> 11:15:17.723]  It's really disgusting when you look at it.
[11:15:18.544 --> 11:15:19.646]  It is disgusting.
[11:15:19.906 --> 11:15:25.671]  Chris Cuomo tape, where he actually, you know, he's pulling the switch under the desk where Congressman Collins is about to say WikiLeaks.
[11:15:25.831 --> 11:15:26.511]  It's like, whoops!
[11:15:26.652 --> 11:15:28.193]  And then he's such a terrible actor.
[11:15:28.213 --> 11:15:30.515]  He goes, oh sorry, we lost that feed.
[11:15:30.715 --> 11:15:31.415]  We didn't mean to do that.
[11:15:31.435 --> 11:15:33.037]  When you lose a feed, it cuts out.
[11:15:33.097 --> 11:15:34.158]  It doesn't have color bars.
[11:15:34.458 --> 11:15:34.778]  Seriously.
[11:15:34.798 --> 11:15:35.579]  That's another feed.
[11:15:36.139 --> 11:15:38.061]  I'm in TV, let me tell you.
[11:15:38.081 --> 11:15:40.643]  75 million dollar operation, but they can't even keep their feet up long enough?
[11:15:40.683 --> 11:15:41.804]  Well, you don't go to color bars.
[11:15:41.864 --> 11:15:43.766]  If a satellite feed cuts out, it goes black.
[11:15:45.265 --> 11:15:45.605]  Go ahead.
[11:15:45.625 --> 11:15:46.506]  Terrible actor.
[11:15:46.666 --> 11:15:47.827]  Terrible actor.
[11:15:47.847 --> 11:15:51.629]  You know, I was expecting more of a performance from him when he cut the feet off of that guy.
[11:15:51.990 --> 11:15:53.130]  But there's no respect for him.
[11:15:53.311 --> 11:15:54.231]  This is a lawmaker.
[11:15:54.271 --> 11:15:56.153]  This is a lawmaker of the U.S.
[11:15:56.273 --> 11:15:58.094]  Congress talking about WikiLeaks.
[11:15:58.114 --> 11:15:59.615]  The least we can do is listen.
[11:16:00.576 --> 11:16:01.236]  Well, that's it.
[11:16:01.436 --> 11:16:03.938]  I mean, it's just arrogance on PCP.
[11:16:04.859 --> 11:16:05.679]  I want your prediction.
[11:16:05.719 --> 11:16:09.122]  And my prediction is Trump is going to win this election.
[11:16:09.482 --> 11:16:11.403]  He's way ahead in internal polls.
[11:16:12.044 --> 11:16:13.405]  He's way ahead in swing states.
[11:16:15.703 --> 11:16:19.066]  I think metaphysically he's going to win, but I think they're going to try to steal it.
[11:16:19.346 --> 11:16:20.687]  And they're just getting the public ready for that.
[11:16:20.968 --> 11:16:21.608]  And here's the deal.
[11:16:22.029 --> 11:16:23.390]  We don't need to get violent over this.
[11:16:23.470 --> 11:16:27.453]  We need to expose it and realize... People say, oh, you're a pacifist.
[11:16:27.553 --> 11:16:27.834]  No, no.
[11:16:28.194 --> 11:16:30.276]  Soros is trying to get ready for a race war in this country.
[11:16:30.916 --> 11:16:32.238]  People say, oh, you say the cops are perfect.
[11:16:32.278 --> 11:16:32.718]  No, I don't.
[11:16:32.738 --> 11:16:35.080]  The point is killing random cops is the way to fix this, okay?
[11:16:35.360 --> 11:16:36.521]  They're the lowest level of government.
[11:16:36.541 --> 11:16:38.783]  We should not cop them out, pun intended.
[11:16:39.024 --> 11:16:40.685]  We should deal with the top of the pyramid.
[11:16:42.717 --> 11:16:43.958]  If they steal this, we win.
[11:16:44.619 --> 11:16:48.864]  The biggest thing is if Trump gets in, they're going to sabotage him in every level.
[11:16:49.104 --> 11:16:54.691]  Now, I want him to get in because it's the right thing, but don't freak out if they steal it, folks, because they're then going uphill.
[11:16:55.441 --> 11:17:21.956]  You know, Leanna and I were talking about this behind the scenes, and, you know, listening to her talk, she said, you know, Maggie, she might have this, I'm sorry Leanna if you're listening, but I got, you know, my heart sank, because honestly, like, this cannot be, but even, even if she does, you know, we're still on the earth, there's still favor on the earth, there's still a, you know, a covering on the earth, it's not the, you're absolutely right, it's not the end of the world with that, but unfortunately it makes it so much harder for the next generation, it is this uphill, we're right on the hill.
[11:17:22.016 --> 11:17:23.517]  Sure, but them stealing it makes it even more naked.
[11:17:25.066 --> 11:17:28.148]  I mean, let me just look at that, because I want the right thing to happen.
[11:17:28.188 --> 11:17:31.191]  I want to try to make stuff better, but, you know, maybe it's not supposed to happen.
[11:17:31.911 --> 11:17:35.014]  So all I'm saying is, imagine she gets in with all this dirt.
[11:17:35.754 --> 11:17:36.955]  How discredited are they now?
[11:17:36.975 --> 11:17:38.536]  Because they had to have it.
[11:17:38.556 --> 11:17:39.357]  They had to steal it.
[11:17:40.037 --> 11:17:40.558]  Think about that.
[11:17:41.799 --> 11:17:42.859]  No, no, I do what I do.
[11:17:43.220 --> 11:17:43.880]  I do what's right.
[11:17:43.940 --> 11:17:45.201]  I don't calculate Machiavellian.
[11:17:45.541 --> 11:17:49.144]  But I'm sitting back down Machiavellian watching, and I'm like, go ahead and steal it.
[11:17:50.425 --> 11:17:52.447]  Because it's going to blow up like...
[11:17:53.086 --> 11:17:53.546]  Mount St.
[11:17:53.607 --> 11:17:54.227]  Helens.
[11:17:54.648 --> 11:17:58.271]  Well, we might all end up on a Do Not Fly as political, you know.
[11:17:58.471 --> 11:17:59.372]  She says she wants that.
[11:17:59.392 --> 11:18:01.074]  You know, honestly, look at Michael Savage.
[11:18:01.474 --> 11:18:06.459]  You can't speak out against them because Jazzybelle is on the loose and she's a very vindictive lady.
[11:18:06.479 --> 11:18:11.844]  And that woman's keeping a list of anybody that tried to take her down before she gets there.
[11:18:11.964 --> 11:18:13.566]  Well, believe me, I know I want to talk about it.
[11:18:15.124 --> 11:18:21.206]  Not about me, but why do you think she would break from her prepared speech, the only time she did the speech, to call me the dark heart?
[11:18:21.466 --> 11:18:25.608]  Because, Alex, you're obviously at the tip of the spear.
[11:18:25.648 --> 11:18:31.370]  You're right there, and there's a spigot, there's a watershed behind you, and people are so thirsty for this.
[11:18:31.470 --> 11:18:32.410]  It's like we're holding a hose.
[11:18:32.430 --> 11:18:32.770]  That's right.
[11:18:32.850 --> 11:18:34.151]  It's not me, it's the people.
[11:18:34.531 --> 11:18:36.692]  She feels the spirit of resistance.
[11:18:37.552 --> 11:18:37.952]  She sees it.
[11:18:37.972 --> 11:18:38.872]  You represent it.
[11:18:38.912 --> 11:18:39.492]  You embody it.
[11:18:39.512 --> 11:18:43.533]  So to give those people some sort of voice and to say, look, here we are.
[11:18:43.553 --> 11:18:45.894]  You do a good job, a perfect job of that.
[11:18:45.974 --> 11:18:47.634]  Of course, you're the evil one.
[11:18:47.674 --> 11:18:49.595]  She's got to stick a spear in that dark part of yours.
[11:18:49.715 --> 11:18:52.756]  Well, what she hates is the fact that I'm not afraid to die.
[11:18:53.476 --> 11:18:54.336]  That takes her power.
[11:18:55.136 --> 11:18:56.316]  The fact that... Do not be afraid.
[11:18:57.977 --> 11:19:01.698]  That's the one thing I hope that we can lead this audience to is do not be afraid of this.
[11:19:01.718 --> 11:19:02.398]  That's how they win.
[11:19:02.418 --> 11:19:03.238]  That's just how they win.
[11:19:03.789 --> 11:19:04.149]  I agree.
[11:19:04.309 --> 11:19:05.090]  Other points you want to make?
[11:19:05.130 --> 11:19:05.891]  I want to go to some phone calls.
[11:19:05.911 --> 11:19:06.711]  We're on shotgun with us.
[11:19:06.912 --> 11:19:07.392]  Oh my goodness.
[11:19:07.412 --> 11:19:11.395]  So tonight's debate, if I could leave anything with any of you, we were feverishly making notes.
[11:19:11.475 --> 11:19:13.957]  So we need to pay attention to our refugee crisis.
[11:19:13.997 --> 11:19:15.919]  And I know that everybody on the ground is doing that.
[11:19:15.959 --> 11:19:19.882]  But making sure that we understand who's coming into our communities is a big deal.
[11:19:19.922 --> 11:19:20.542]  And he hit that
[11:19:21.263 --> 11:19:22.163]  Kind of hard tonight.
[11:19:22.564 --> 11:19:27.206]  We need to also understand our civilization is going to look very different when she gets into office.
[11:19:27.266 --> 11:19:28.666]  We're not going to be the same people.
[11:19:28.726 --> 11:19:29.827]  Our borders are going to be down.
[11:19:29.847 --> 11:19:31.508]  We're going to be more vulnerable and susceptible.
[11:19:31.568 --> 11:19:33.408]  And people need to kind of get ready for that.
[11:19:33.428 --> 11:19:36.990]  And I hate to say that, but... They're letting leprosy in.
[11:19:37.010 --> 11:19:38.190]  They're letting TB.
[11:19:38.371 --> 11:19:39.911]  They won't even treat the poor people coming in.
[11:19:40.251 --> 11:19:41.372]  I'd be like, oh, you have TB?
[11:19:41.392 --> 11:19:42.152]  Come in, we'll treat you.
[11:19:42.232 --> 11:19:42.412]  No.
[11:19:42.732 --> 11:19:43.373]  They don't even treat them.
[11:19:43.393 --> 11:19:44.733]  Just here you're in a school with other kids.
[11:19:44.813 --> 11:19:45.934]  It's so diabolical.
[11:19:47.426 --> 11:19:48.867]  Oh Alex, seriously.
[11:19:49.167 --> 11:19:50.368]  No, it's diabolical.
[11:19:50.388 --> 11:19:51.869]  Keep going, I'm sorry.
[11:19:51.969 --> 11:19:52.569]  It's fine.
[11:19:52.649 --> 11:19:54.510]  Okay, that was one of our major points.
[11:19:54.850 --> 11:19:56.872]  The woman is going to start World War III with Russia.
[11:19:56.952 --> 11:19:58.773]  Even Jill Stein said that to me a couple of days ago.
[11:19:58.793 --> 11:20:03.576]  She said, Maggie, look, when Hillary gets into office, you can bet on it, the woman is going to war with Russia.
[11:20:03.596 --> 11:20:04.516]  In fact, cue that up.
[11:20:04.556 --> 11:20:05.017]  Cue that up.
[11:20:05.677 --> 11:20:06.217]  It's coming.
[11:20:06.758 --> 11:20:07.138]  Keep going.
[11:20:08.302 --> 11:20:13.783]  We've got Green Party people and Socialist people understanding Hillary's diabolical nature, wanting World War III.
[11:20:13.803 --> 11:20:15.684]  She wants to bring about the end of civilization, Alex.
[11:20:15.704 --> 11:20:17.144]  I'm pretty confident of that.
[11:20:17.184 --> 11:20:18.325]  No, I mean, I don't just say that.
[11:20:18.405 --> 11:20:19.365]  She is evil.
[11:20:19.745 --> 11:20:20.405]  There's no question.
[11:20:20.745 --> 11:20:29.847]  So this misguided but smart national, and he gets it, clearly misguided, but she even gets that Hillary Clinton is a... She gets we should have war with Russia when Russia's doing nothing.
[11:20:29.947 --> 11:20:31.648]  Some people say, oh, why are you a Russian agent?
[11:20:32.028 --> 11:20:33.428]  Russia isn't doing anything!
[11:20:33.988 --> 11:20:37.149]  I mean, Russia doesn't... Our movies are like run by China now.
[11:20:37.369 --> 11:20:47.943]  Seriously, so we have a group of people that literally they're pulling their kids out of private schools abroad, preparing for the US to make their first move.
[11:20:47.983 --> 11:20:49.745]  That's right, that's mainstream news.
[11:20:49.806 --> 11:20:53.651]  It's insane, it's the most insane time to be alive Alex, it really is.
[11:20:54.051 --> 11:20:58.293]  And like you said, all because Russia was under all this control, they're trying to become Christian now.
[11:20:58.313 --> 11:20:59.093]  They're Christians, Alex.
[11:20:59.113 --> 11:21:00.194]  The globalists can't stand it.
[11:21:00.274 --> 11:21:03.715]  They cannot have a Christian group that supports anti-abortion.
[11:21:03.735 --> 11:21:05.756]  It freaks them out.
[11:21:05.796 --> 11:21:06.896]  They don't know what to do with it.
[11:21:06.936 --> 11:21:19.802]  They're like, okay, wait a second, so this group, they're Orthodox, they have a Christian population, they don't murder their babies, and they sort of, you know... Imagine a mammal that doesn't murder its babies.
[11:21:20.222 --> 11:21:20.762]  We have that.
[11:21:20.802 --> 11:21:21.683]  They gotta go.
[11:21:21.963 --> 11:21:23.364]  We gotta wipe them off the planet.
[11:21:23.404 --> 11:21:27.087]  We're gonna use old rhetoric that's basically a lie now to do it.
[11:21:27.927 --> 11:21:28.608]  People wake up.
[11:21:29.318 --> 11:21:32.059]  Yeah, we're not blaming any woman that does that.
[11:21:32.099 --> 11:21:33.200]  Things are bad, we get it.
[11:21:33.240 --> 11:21:35.401]  But the point is, celebrating it is evil.
[11:21:35.741 --> 11:21:37.102]  Just don't celebrate the abortion.
[11:21:37.262 --> 11:21:37.722]  That's true.
[11:21:37.802 --> 11:21:39.984]  So, again, let me stress that as a woman.
[11:21:40.384 --> 11:21:44.946]  Look, if there's a mistake that has happened, move on, pick up, go on.
[11:21:45.226 --> 11:21:50.269]  We're talking about a culture that, you know, specifically in the United States, women are encouraged.
[11:21:50.389 --> 11:21:54.231]  It's a weird, weird, weird thing happening in our civilization.
[11:21:54.771 --> 11:21:56.992]  We're not judging you, just don't celebrate it.
[11:21:57.093 --> 11:21:58.713]  What's satanic is a celebration.
[11:21:58.733 --> 11:21:59.214]  There you go.
[11:21:59.674 --> 11:22:00.114]  There you go.
[11:22:00.615 --> 11:22:02.456]  All right, we got Leanne wants to come to the microphone.
[11:22:02.496 --> 11:22:03.076]  I see her in there.
[11:22:03.116 --> 11:22:04.077]  Leanne, come in here if you want.
[11:22:04.097 --> 11:22:04.977]  We're trying to get you on air.
[11:22:05.317 --> 11:22:06.358]  Oh, she's got her Hillary mask on.
[11:22:06.378 --> 11:22:06.998]  Go ahead and put it on.
[11:22:07.679 --> 11:22:08.980]  Leanne is in there going wild.
[11:22:09.040 --> 11:22:09.820]  Leanne, come on in there.
[11:22:09.840 --> 11:22:11.881]  I was going to get her on air, but she was filing reports.
[11:22:11.901 --> 11:22:12.982]  I want to go to some phone calls.
[11:22:13.002 --> 11:22:13.302]  Stay here.
[11:22:13.322 --> 11:22:14.283]  I want to get her in.
[11:22:14.543 --> 11:22:15.483]  Leanne, you ready to come in here?
[11:22:16.324 --> 11:22:16.724]  Come in there.
[11:22:16.744 --> 11:22:17.465]  Go in the other studio.
[11:22:20.373 --> 11:22:21.334]  I just saw Leanne at the microphone.
[11:22:21.354 --> 11:22:22.635]  Let's take a few calls while she gets ready.
[11:22:23.035 --> 11:22:25.257]  Okay, I see like 20-something phones loaded up.
[11:22:25.317 --> 11:22:26.198]  I can't read the top one.
[11:22:27.759 --> 11:22:28.700]  We got Leanne coming in here.
[11:22:30.001 --> 11:22:30.701]  Oh, it's Hillary.
[11:22:30.761 --> 11:22:31.242]  I'm sorry.
[11:22:31.262 --> 11:22:36.826]  Hillary's never looked so good, Alex.
[11:22:36.886 --> 11:22:38.187]  Yeah, I can say that right now.
[11:22:38.247 --> 11:22:41.510]  Hey guys, how did I do during the debate?
[11:22:41.530 --> 11:22:42.771]  You did really good.
[11:22:43.251 --> 11:22:45.153]  Telling us out to the globalists.
[11:22:48.994 --> 11:22:50.304]  Who's saying Trump won the final debate?
[11:22:50.344 --> 11:22:50.807]  Who's saying that?
[11:22:54.253 --> 11:22:55.814]  No, can't be.
[11:22:55.934 --> 11:22:57.875]  Can we pull another chair up?
[11:22:57.915 --> 11:23:00.576]  I want Hillary to host the show with us.
[11:23:00.616 --> 11:23:02.998]  Hillary Clinton joins us.
[11:23:03.078 --> 11:23:03.618]  InfoWars.
[11:23:03.998 --> 11:23:07.139]  I'm going to go to tape and then back to Hillary.
[11:23:07.560 --> 11:23:08.260]  No, stay there.
[11:23:08.280 --> 11:23:08.620]  Don't go.
[11:23:08.640 --> 11:23:10.061]  We're going to move a chair in here for her.
[11:23:10.481 --> 11:23:11.522]  And the kid Daniels is coming on.
[11:23:11.542 --> 11:23:14.503]  We're going to get your phone calls from all of you that are patiently holding.
[11:23:14.943 --> 11:23:16.244]  This is huge, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:23:16.624 --> 11:23:18.345]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[11:23:19.045 --> 11:23:19.745]  That's the real Hillary.
[11:23:19.765 --> 11:23:20.545]  Don't make a conspiracy theory.
[11:23:20.565 --> 11:23:21.186]  It's not a question.
[11:23:21.646 --> 11:23:24.046]  But right now, let's go ahead and play a clip here.
[11:23:24.967 --> 11:23:25.627]  Let's go ahead.
[11:23:25.687 --> 11:23:26.627]  What should we play first?
[11:23:27.167 --> 11:23:27.627]  Look at this.
[11:23:28.448 --> 11:23:31.248]  We've got so much to cover here, but I don't know which clip to go to.
[11:23:32.069 --> 11:23:34.809]  How about Hillary to use shadow government to cancel the election?
[11:23:34.829 --> 11:23:35.730]  We'll only play part of it.
[11:23:35.750 --> 11:23:39.131]  Then we're going to bring another chair in here and get these ladies in here together.
[11:23:39.551 --> 11:23:40.791]  Hillary and Margaret Howell.
[11:23:40.811 --> 11:23:41.811]  Wait until the next election.
[11:23:41.831 --> 11:23:43.432]  I'm going to be the president forever.
[11:23:44.887 --> 11:23:46.528]  My God, well this is tripping me out.
[11:23:46.968 --> 11:23:47.808]  Is this really happening?
[11:23:47.828 --> 11:23:48.789]  Hillary's actually here.
[11:23:48.809 --> 11:23:51.550]  Hillary Clinton now on the InfoWars live stream.
[11:23:51.990 --> 11:23:53.110]  No, no, both of you ladies stay here.
[11:23:53.130 --> 11:23:53.530]  Don't leave.
[11:23:54.331 --> 11:23:56.592]  Hillary, not a lady, but Hillary and Margaret.
[11:23:56.932 --> 11:23:58.812]  I'm an aggressive butch.
[11:23:59.753 --> 11:24:01.934]  We've got Hillary, Chance, lock her up.
[11:24:02.554 --> 11:24:05.555]  We've got a bunch of other clubs here.
[11:24:05.975 --> 11:24:07.416]  Are you guys ready with that club?
[11:24:08.736 --> 11:24:09.997]  You know what, can you swap me?
[11:24:10.137 --> 11:24:12.298]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to...
[11:24:14.204 --> 11:24:16.606]  Alex Jones wanting the Hillary Clinton culture, where are you going to go to?
[11:24:16.626 --> 11:24:18.928]  Trump's secret weapon or shadow government?
[11:24:18.948 --> 11:24:19.488]  Shadow government.
[11:24:19.769 --> 11:24:21.790]  Hillary to use shadow government to cancel the election.
[11:24:22.071 --> 11:24:24.272]  Here it is.
[11:24:24.392 --> 11:24:28.696]  Americanism, not globalism will be our credo!
[11:24:28.896 --> 11:24:31.158]  Americanism, not globalism!
[11:24:31.338 --> 11:24:33.320]  Americanism, not globalism!
[11:24:34.853 --> 11:24:41.178]  I'm going to break down here in the next few minutes the latest WikiLeaks with new revelations by the thousands coming out each day.
[11:24:41.238 --> 11:24:49.104]  But if you look at the full spectrum of the last month, it's clear the mainstream media is completely directed by a group above Hillary Clinton, a shadow government.
[11:24:49.564 --> 11:24:52.026]  And that just came out in the latest emails last night.
[11:24:52.747 --> 11:24:56.349]  Clearly, Hillary and the globalists are planning to try to steal the election.
[11:24:56.730 --> 11:25:02.134]  Internal polls show Trump way ahead and sell the whole thing as a way to, quote, stabilize
[11:25:03.880 --> 11:25:06.741]  Our internet grid and other telecommunication systems.
[11:25:07.361 --> 11:25:17.023]  So we are witnessing the preparation just 20 days out for the shadow government to steal the election, not from Donald Trump, but from the American people.
[11:25:17.724 --> 11:25:26.746]  In Washington, in other hidden sites around the nation, there is a world so secret, insiders call it black.
[11:25:26.806 --> 11:25:30.307]  Because no light shines in to reveal what is hidden there.
[11:25:34.420 --> 11:25:37.564]  A world of super-secret defense and intelligence programs.
[11:25:38.385 --> 11:25:39.286]  Black programs.
[11:25:41.730 --> 11:25:44.954]  Hundreds of thousands of people work in this shadowy world.
[11:25:45.595 --> 11:25:47.979]  Pass their lives in black programs.
[11:25:48.757 --> 11:26:03.752]  Before he died, I was able to interview several times Anthony Sutton, who had been the chief congressional archivist during major bipartisan committee hearings dealing with the fact that after World War II, with the threat of nuclear war,
[11:26:04.913 --> 11:26:14.039]  In our examination of the Doomsday Program, we've shown how, in the name of national security, the National Program Office, a classified program with a legitimate mission,
[11:26:33.610 --> 11:26:41.153]  Overstepped its authority, committed fraud, covered up abuses, avoided oversight, and retaliated against people who challenged its power.
[11:26:41.673 --> 11:26:57.340]  By the 1980s, Congress held other hearings dealing with the fact that COG had been used to build a parallel government, or a power structure outside the purview of Congress, the American people, and in some cases, the Supreme Court and even the President.
[11:26:57.900 --> 11:26:59.821]  FEMA was established in 1979 to basically organize
[11:27:02.302 --> 11:27:12.325]  The federalized control outside of Congress, or even the states, to establish 10 regions that would be controlled by the Continuity of Government Board.
[11:27:12.766 --> 11:27:19.828]  Now the experience we've had in the United States is not the first time that COG has been used to attempt to take over a country.
[11:27:20.528 --> 11:27:31.552]  If you go back to World War II, towards the end, the Nazis had set up a system, in case their high command was taken out, where the Nazis could regain control of the country.
[11:27:32.984 --> 11:27:40.931]  Patriots fighting against Hitler reversed it in Operation Valkyrie and used the COG to hijack the government.
[11:27:41.551 --> 11:27:47.876]  Unfortunately, they did not succeed in their assassination attempt on Hitler, so within 48 hours, the operation failed.
[11:27:48.137 --> 11:27:53.021]  But that's an example of good guys using COG to try to fight a tyrant.
[11:27:53.641 --> 11:28:03.708]  Here in the United States, multinational interests, it's now been declassified, have used COG systems to circumvent Congress, the people, the courts, the media, you name it.
[11:28:04.528 --> 11:28:11.072]  We've seen tens of thousands of WikiLeaks emails of Podesta, Hillary Clinton's chief of staff, and others released in the last few weeks.
[11:28:11.753 --> 11:28:14.434]  But this new data dump comes from the FBI.
[11:28:15.155 --> 11:28:20.759]  On Monday, they released thousands of pages of emails of high-up Clinton aides, as well as Hillary.
[11:28:21.679 --> 11:28:29.309]  Organizing a cover-up of what was really happening with her investigation with the emails and the classified information.
[11:28:29.710 --> 11:28:32.613]  And over and over again in the emails released by the FBI.
[11:28:32.874 --> 11:28:33.815]  So this isn't questioned.
[11:28:34.315 --> 11:28:36.498]  Hillary tells her staff, don't worry.
[11:28:37.359 --> 11:28:38.739]  COG has taken over.
[11:28:38.779 --> 11:28:39.940]  And they say, what's COG?
[11:28:40.340 --> 11:28:44.000]  Oh, it's the seventh floor or shadow government.
[11:28:44.481 --> 11:28:49.322]  It's handling the media, the corporations, the Congress, the courts.
[11:28:49.662 --> 11:28:51.882]  Don't worry, nothing's going to happen.
[11:28:52.262 --> 11:29:00.444]  So they take a system designed to safeguard the government in a nuclear attack, if the main government's knocked out, to actually set up a parallel government.
[11:29:01.024 --> 11:29:03.685]  And this has happened over and over again in third world countries.
[11:29:04.065 --> 11:29:05.366]  It's allowed coups in Russia.
[11:29:05.746 --> 11:29:10.068]  This system of having a backup government almost always leads to a coup d'etat.
[11:29:10.789 --> 11:29:12.249]  But in the West, it's more sophisticated.
[11:29:12.289 --> 11:29:13.450]  It's an unspoken coup.
[11:29:14.130 --> 11:29:21.354]  And as long as the mainstream media goes along with it and ignores all these incredible revelations, the coup is able to operate in the dark.
[11:29:22.349 --> 11:29:38.285]  The FBI released other documents yesterday as well, showing 50-plus pages of memos from senior FBI agents who were visiting with Hillary Clinton's aides and top staff at the State Department, saying, listen, we'll give you a lucrative job at the State Department.
[11:29:38.465 --> 11:29:39.947]  You can be the ambassador's assistant.
[11:29:40.247 --> 11:29:41.829]  You'll make three times as much money.
[11:29:42.249 --> 11:29:45.312]  Just don't report that she was passing classified emails.
[11:29:46.013 --> 11:29:53.102]  The FBI went and filed internal memos on this, and the FBI agents are in the memos so upset, saying, call a grand jury!
[11:29:53.402 --> 11:29:54.343]  This is espionage!
[11:29:54.904 --> 11:29:55.605]  This is fraud!
[11:29:55.645 --> 11:29:56.446]  This is racketeering!
[11:29:56.886 --> 11:29:59.489]  They will be indicted right away!
[11:29:59.630 --> 11:30:02.193]  It is 10.30, straight up, and it is 11.30 Eastern.
[11:30:04.595 --> 11:30:06.177]  1030 Central, I'm Alex Jones.
[11:30:06.257 --> 11:30:08.639]  We are here and we are so incredibly blessed.
[11:30:08.659 --> 11:30:12.983]  We have crew obviously in Las Vegas, David Knight and Josh Owens.
[11:30:13.023 --> 11:30:16.607]  And we have Hillary Clinton here with Margaret Howell joining us.
[11:30:16.647 --> 11:30:17.868]  This is amazing.
[11:30:18.288 --> 11:30:20.550]  When mainstream news tells us things, we go along with it.
[11:30:20.591 --> 11:30:21.471]  So we're telling you as well.
[11:30:21.491 --> 11:30:25.395]  If you're a radio listener, it's actually unimaginable with a big Hillary Clinton face mask on.
[11:30:25.415 --> 11:30:27.257]  Whoever came up with this gets a big raise.
[11:30:27.297 --> 11:30:27.877]  This is crazy.
[11:30:29.999 --> 11:30:37.326]  You're openly in the WikiLeaks saying you want to shadow government, keep the public dumbed down and stupid, and you've always said you want to ban guns.
[11:30:37.527 --> 11:30:39.809]  Is that true, or where do you stand on the Second Amendment?
[11:30:40.299 --> 11:30:45.942]  You know, I'd have to check with my speechwriters, Alex, but I think that I've flip-flopped several times on this issue.
[11:30:46.942 --> 11:30:48.843]  You heard my answer in the debate tonight.
[11:30:48.983 --> 11:30:54.046]  I didn't really mention the Constitution once, nor did I mention protecting the Second Amendment.
[11:30:54.086 --> 11:30:55.847]  It's really not that important to me.
[11:30:56.487 --> 11:30:58.448]  What is important is taking your guns.
[11:30:59.408 --> 11:31:02.030]  I really do want to protect that late-term abortion.
[11:31:05.407 --> 11:31:10.113]  What about your $35 million that you got from Russia to give them the uranium?
[11:31:10.433 --> 11:31:12.576]  You were saying that Trump was a Russki agent today.
[11:31:12.596 --> 11:31:16.120]  You know, you also said I have a dark heart and that I'm a Russki.
[11:31:16.320 --> 11:31:19.564]  So I haven't been to Russia and I haven't ever dated a Russian woman.
[11:31:19.584 --> 11:31:21.987]  I'm not saying I was, they're very lovely, but how am I a Russki?
[11:31:22.007 --> 11:31:22.868]  I haven't figured this out yet.
[11:31:23.351 --> 11:31:39.162]  Well, Alex, you know, I've really studied Saul Alinsky for quite some time, and, uh, one of the oldest tricks in the book is projecting, and really everything that I myself am guilty of, the Dark Heart, for instance, I've learned to project that on my enemy, my opponent.
[11:31:39.182 --> 11:31:39.283]  It's...
[11:31:39.943 --> 11:31:42.526]  It's a very effective, amazing skit.
[11:31:42.546 --> 11:31:49.493]  Margaret Howell, would you like to, as Thurston Howell III's daughter, granddaughter, would you like to ask Hillary any questions?
[11:31:49.553 --> 11:31:50.554]  That is just a rumor.
[11:31:50.575 --> 11:31:53.358]  I cannot confirm or deny that.
[11:31:53.378 --> 11:31:54.459]  I'm actually Thurston Howell III.
[11:31:56.038 --> 11:32:03.063]  Look, Alex has never dated a Russian woman, he is not a Ruski agent, and we don't work for the Kremlin.
[11:32:03.544 --> 11:32:10.689]  Look, your blatant attack on the Second Amendment actually wasn't too blatant tonight, it was more subversive.
[11:32:10.709 --> 11:32:12.890]  I'm nice and friendly, don't worry about me.
[11:32:12.930 --> 11:32:13.831]  You seem desperate.
[11:32:16.613 --> 11:32:17.633]  Very medicated tonight.
[11:32:17.673 --> 11:32:18.333]  What was up with that?
[11:32:18.494 --> 11:32:27.276]  Well, you know, they almost triggered me when they started talking about WikiLeaks, but I feel like I did a very good job pivoting back to the Russians to let everyone know.
[11:32:27.696 --> 11:32:28.736]  It's not about the content.
[11:32:28.756 --> 11:32:29.937]  By the way, hold on one moment.
[11:32:29.977 --> 11:32:33.577]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[11:32:33.657 --> 11:32:35.458]  Let me just... Hello?
[11:32:35.538 --> 11:32:36.998]  Mr. Putin, what is my order?
[11:32:37.018 --> 11:32:38.139]  Okay, alright.
[11:32:38.619 --> 11:32:40.839]  I should oppose World War III?
[11:32:40.879 --> 11:32:42.200]  Well, I already knew that, so that's good.
[11:32:42.220 --> 11:32:43.000]  Thank you, sir.
[11:32:43.663 --> 11:32:44.724]  We'll see what's happening next week.
[11:32:45.024 --> 11:32:51.309]  Mr. and Mrs. America, this is what it's important for everyone to know, that the Russians are clearly trying to sway our elections.
[11:32:51.989 --> 11:33:01.296]  Disregard everything you've seen in WikiLeaks and DNC leaks as far as from the DNC, that we've actually been trying to sway the elections.
[11:33:01.376 --> 11:33:02.216]  It's the Russians.
[11:33:03.137 --> 11:33:04.318]  It's the Russians, okay?
[11:33:04.358 --> 11:33:06.620]  And I don't want open borders, open trade.
[11:33:06.640 --> 11:33:09.502]  I was talking about energy, okay?
[11:33:10.562 --> 11:33:10.943]  Energy.
[11:33:12.250 --> 11:33:13.974]  The Russians don't want World War III.
[11:33:14.014 --> 11:33:15.457]  They also don't want Hillary Clinton.
[11:33:15.557 --> 11:33:16.920]  Maybe that's, you know...
[11:33:18.706 --> 11:33:20.507]  Well, it's a crazy world.
[11:33:20.547 --> 11:33:31.850]  Hillary, I want you to take some phone calls from Haboo in Wisconsin, Frank in Florida, Matt in Florida, Rich in Wisconsin, Robert in Pennsylvania, Mike in Great Britain, uh, is that Patty in Texas?
[11:33:31.930 --> 11:33:32.610]  I can't read that.
[11:33:32.730 --> 11:33:36.731]  Patif, Mike in Ohio, Gene in New York, and Joe in Arizona.
[11:33:37.211 --> 11:33:40.372]  Right now, let's go to Great Britain first, because they're holding from overseas.
[11:33:40.753 --> 11:33:44.214]  Let's talk to Mike in her Britannic Majesty's Albion.
[11:33:44.654 --> 11:33:45.154]  You're on the air.
[11:33:45.868 --> 11:33:50.631]  Good evening, Alex, and I know you say don't do it, but thank you so much for standing in the gap.
[11:33:50.651 --> 11:33:52.532]  There's a couple things.
[11:33:55.173 --> 11:34:03.058]  Title 18, Section 2071, when Hillary admitted that she made a mistake, that mistake is spelled espionage.
[11:34:03.778 --> 11:34:09.001]  And in Title 18, Section 2071, she is not eligible to hold an office.
[11:34:10.207 --> 11:34:13.369]  I don't know, that hasn't really been, I haven't heard that being brought out.
[11:34:13.649 --> 11:34:17.890]  Sure, well the big argument secretly is she was a double agent spy, it was authorized.
[11:34:18.311 --> 11:34:23.793]  They're not, the globalists, their whole lie is they're helping us, they're selling us out.
[11:34:25.134 --> 11:34:26.674]  What difference does it make?
[11:34:27.134 --> 11:34:30.816]  What difference does it make if we ship weapons to Al Qaeda and kill the ambassador?
[11:34:32.497 --> 11:34:37.459]  And then email it too, you know, supporting logistically and militarily ISIS, I mean,
[11:34:38.630 --> 11:34:41.892]  But even doing the Iranian deal shows that she's a foreign agent that way.
[11:34:43.653 --> 11:34:47.895]  Well, my server let the Russians write in, but what difference does it make?
[11:34:47.915 --> 11:34:48.956]  She's bigger than a foreign agent.
[11:34:48.976 --> 11:34:50.336]  She represents the Chinese president.
[11:34:50.416 --> 11:34:51.237]  Oh, I agree with you, Mike.
[11:34:52.417 --> 11:34:54.178]  Yeah, there is something actually really important.
[11:34:54.738 --> 11:35:01.662]  I think it's imperative not to fall prey to the narrative like, oh, Russia, you know, it's a priority to anyone that has anything to do with it.
[11:35:01.982 --> 11:35:05.704]  Because rational people talk so that we can avoid war.
[11:35:06.803 --> 11:35:09.624]  And they want to shut down that type of discussion.
[11:35:09.644 --> 11:35:11.744]  It's like, you don't want World War III?
[11:35:11.804 --> 11:35:14.285]  I guess you're in love with Putin.
[11:35:15.005 --> 11:35:16.425]  I'm like, I'm in love with my children.
[11:35:17.286 --> 11:35:17.666]  Amen.
[11:35:18.206 --> 11:35:23.767]  I think it'd be brilliant if you could interview Putin and give him the voice that he needs in front of the American public.
[11:35:23.787 --> 11:35:25.127]  Remember in St.
[11:35:25.147 --> 11:35:27.768]  Petersburg when he says, what do I have to get through to you?
[11:35:27.868 --> 11:35:29.148]  Well, we know we have a corrupt media.
[11:35:29.328 --> 11:35:30.409]  No, I agree.
[11:35:30.449 --> 11:35:31.389]  We haven't reached out.
[11:35:31.749 --> 11:35:32.269]  We should.
[11:35:32.349 --> 11:35:34.290]  I think if Putin came here, they couldn't ignore the interview.
[11:35:35.450 --> 11:35:35.690]  Amen.
[11:35:37.563 --> 11:35:38.784]  I love the interview with Putin.
[11:35:38.884 --> 11:35:40.945]  I mean, Putin's not doing anything to anybody.
[11:35:41.005 --> 11:35:42.166]  Russia's, like, rebuilding.
[11:35:42.547 --> 11:35:44.888]  It's not... I mean, China is literally taking us over.
[11:35:44.908 --> 11:35:48.511]  I don't think it's the Chinese, but, you know, God... I'm not in your country.
[11:35:48.531 --> 11:35:49.431]  I'm not in your nation, you know?
[11:35:50.432 --> 11:35:56.076]  Alex, I don't really talk to anyone unless they donate at least a million dollars into my foundation.
[11:35:58.637 --> 11:36:00.639]  I know that you stole the two billion from the Haitians.
[11:36:00.819 --> 11:36:01.860]  Mike, thank you.
[11:36:01.880 --> 11:36:04.241]  Let's talk to Habu in Wisconsin.
[11:36:04.261 --> 11:36:04.982]  Habu, you're on the air.
[11:36:07.378 --> 11:36:09.980]  Good evening and thank you very much for this opportunity.
[11:36:10.000 --> 11:36:21.649]  And kudos to you InfoWars and Alex Jones for doing this and giving the other side against this totally biased media.
[11:36:22.189 --> 11:36:23.810]  We're giving Hillary equal time now.
[11:36:23.830 --> 11:36:25.091]  She's here with us.
[11:36:26.833 --> 11:36:29.014]  She doesn't smell like sulfur tonight either.
[11:36:29.255 --> 11:36:31.596]  I was going to say a face that only a mother could like, you know.
[11:36:33.858 --> 11:36:34.398]  But anyway,
[11:36:35.410 --> 11:36:49.779]  You know, in this debate, I think this was the best debate that I saw Trump in because the host, and we have to give credit to the host, he kind of drilled down on the issues and he didn't let, you know, them slide as they did with... No, I agree.
[11:36:49.819 --> 11:36:51.580]  He did the best job.
[11:36:51.760 --> 11:36:55.503]  He was a little biased towards Hillary, but compared to the others, it was a different deal.
[11:36:55.723 --> 11:36:57.704]  I'm going to cut his pay, but yeah.
[11:36:58.965 --> 11:37:20.201]  And he let Trump, you know, come back and retort, which was the best part that Trump did all night, meaning even though he was good on the issues, he would come back and he, his one statement or two statements, one, you know, after she, about the question about letting in thousands of people, he says, oh yeah, you're pivoting it off to Putin, you know, and he kind of caught on that.
[11:37:20.261 --> 11:37:22.983]  And the other one is when he actually shamed her.
[11:37:23.423 --> 11:37:28.067]  He shamed her when he said Podesta, who's a very good, you know, buddy,
[11:37:28.667 --> 11:37:29.569]  I don't know.
[11:37:38.348 --> 11:37:48.795]  When Trump hit her, listen, metaphorically of course, you could see her eyes kind of glaze over and I really thought she was going to, you know, faint right there.
[11:37:49.135 --> 11:37:49.755]  Agreed.
[11:37:49.775 --> 11:37:51.656]  I mean, she's having blood transfusions or something.
[11:37:51.676 --> 11:37:52.637]  She looked like hell before.
[11:37:52.917 --> 11:37:55.299]  She looks bad when she comes in, but worse after an hour and a half.
[11:37:55.779 --> 11:37:56.379]  I mean, that's why.
[11:37:56.620 --> 11:37:58.561]  But she made it through three debates, so I'll give her credit for that.
[11:37:58.581 --> 11:37:59.421]  Are those balloons?
[11:37:59.461 --> 11:38:01.122]  Yeah, exactly.
[11:38:01.163 --> 11:38:02.143]  Habu, great points.
[11:38:02.183 --> 11:38:02.543]  Thank you.
[11:38:02.723 --> 11:38:03.244]  Ladies, go ahead.
[11:38:04.246 --> 11:38:09.369]  All right, so you have had a serious medical fix to be able to stand up.
[11:38:09.409 --> 11:38:12.331]  Your points were sort of on, you know, at least salient.
[11:38:12.351 --> 11:38:13.732]  A lot of affiliates are picking us up.
[11:38:13.812 --> 11:38:17.175]  Liam Maggot is wearing a big giant Hillary mask.
[11:38:17.195 --> 11:38:18.135]  I don't know where this came from.
[11:38:18.215 --> 11:38:19.236]  It's kind of scary.
[11:38:19.276 --> 11:38:20.817]  It's horrifying.
[11:38:21.157 --> 11:38:22.738]  Listen, ladies, it's not that I want to leave.
[11:38:22.898 --> 11:38:25.260]  I'm going to give you the baton just because it's the right thing to do.
[11:38:25.920 --> 11:38:28.203]  Uh, let's bring in... Hillary Clinton's gotta go to her now.
[11:38:28.283 --> 11:38:29.284]  David Knight's in Las Vegas.
[11:38:29.304 --> 11:38:36.873]  Let's bring in, let's bring in Rob Dew, or let's bring in Kit Daniels, or let's bring in one of the other guys, because I'm gonna drive home and listen to you.
[11:38:36.893 --> 11:38:39.737]  And I want you just to run through endless calls at 877-789-2539.
[11:38:41.639 --> 11:38:42.800]  A lot of clips to cover.
[11:38:42.840 --> 11:38:45.183]  And then Leigh-Anne, everybody's tired of looking at Hillary.
[11:38:45.223 --> 11:38:45.944]  Take the mask off.
[11:38:45.964 --> 11:38:50.306]  You notice when Hillary Clinton is like in the debates and she's doing it, she's like, she does this.
[11:38:50.386 --> 11:38:53.408]  Well, they're going to claim that we actually said you were really Hillary.
[11:38:53.448 --> 11:38:54.028]  That's what they do.
[11:38:54.048 --> 11:38:54.889]  So let's admit now.
[11:38:55.249 --> 11:38:56.369]  Leanne, you want to take the mask off?
[11:38:57.150 --> 11:38:58.190]  You're not really Leanne.
[11:38:58.391 --> 11:38:59.251]  You're not really Hillary.
[11:38:59.271 --> 11:39:00.472]  There you go.
[11:39:00.492 --> 11:39:01.052]  Oh my God.
[11:39:01.112 --> 11:39:02.933]  It's hard being so evil.
[11:39:02.953 --> 11:39:04.774]  I want to be doing it all night.
[11:39:05.174 --> 11:39:08.536]  I'm going to let you guys have some time in the next few hours.
[11:39:08.556 --> 11:39:08.996]  13 hours!
[11:39:09.136 --> 11:39:12.818]  It's a subliminal message to Hillary Clinton that it does matter.
[11:39:12.858 --> 11:39:16.400]  Can we go ahead and say that if Donald Trump gets elected, heads will roll.
[11:39:35.610 --> 11:39:40.352]  Alright, who do we got on the line?
[11:39:40.512 --> 11:39:41.813]  Frank in Florida.
[11:39:42.713 --> 11:39:46.315]  And I know you have, if you have, go to your reports too.
[11:39:47.115 --> 11:39:49.456]  I have two more to do.
[11:39:49.697 --> 11:39:54.239]  Guys, make sure you share all of our reports we've uploaded for you.
[11:39:55.131 --> 11:39:55.571]  That's right.
[11:39:55.851 --> 11:39:57.412]  We've got a lot uploaded already.
[11:39:57.912 --> 11:40:00.793]  Hey, Frank in Florida wants to talk about mixed reviews of Trump's performance.
[11:40:00.813 --> 11:40:01.393]  What are you hearing?
[11:40:01.933 --> 11:40:03.874]  Aside from Hillary lying all the time.
[11:40:03.894 --> 11:40:05.694]  What did you hear?
[11:40:05.774 --> 11:40:06.674]  Headless Hillary.
[11:40:06.694 --> 11:40:08.675]  It's great to talk to you, Rob.
[11:40:08.695 --> 11:40:10.336]  I'm hoping we can get a dialogue.
[11:40:10.376 --> 11:40:14.257]  Real time right now, I mean, the headline there, Ron and Trump will not accept election results.
[11:40:15.953 --> 11:40:21.696]  They go right through that, so that's like an inferior message for their next plan as they move forward, I think.
[11:40:21.836 --> 11:40:22.256]  Right.
[11:40:22.296 --> 11:40:26.399]  Well, I kind of like the fact that he didn't say that he was going, you know, he's going to wait and see what they are.
[11:40:26.459 --> 11:40:28.540]  He's going to wait and see what happens that day.
[11:40:28.580 --> 11:40:39.666]  If we catch busloads of people being driven around to cities to vote, or if we see, you know, if we get reports of dead people voting like we have in every election, then yeah, he should question it.
[11:40:42.147 --> 11:40:42.607]  Go ahead.
[11:40:42.627 --> 11:40:45.189]  I just think, I just want to clarify that headline first.
[11:40:46.144 --> 11:40:50.509]  Out of everything that did come from the debate, that right there is a signal they're moving for a steal, no doubt.
[11:41:03.243 --> 11:41:05.125]  No election problems, the Russians are taking over.
[11:41:05.145 --> 11:41:06.045]  That's right, that's right.
[11:41:06.406 --> 11:41:07.307]  And that's the other narrative.
[11:41:07.947 --> 11:41:10.669]  She sat there and talked about the Russians hacking the elections, hacking the elections.
[11:41:11.170 --> 11:41:18.516]  But you've got to accept the elections because if you win, we're going to say the Russians hacked it, but if I win, there's no fraud whatsoever.
[11:41:18.616 --> 11:41:20.538]  You notice that double, that two-sided argument?
[11:41:20.618 --> 11:41:28.625]  And if Hillary loses, is she going to accept the election results or are we going to have to all hear about how the Russians hacked in and, you know, recall?
[11:41:29.125 --> 11:41:29.925]  Which one did they hack?
[11:41:29.965 --> 11:41:32.126]  The electorate or the popular vote?
[11:41:32.526 --> 11:41:33.067]  Or both?
[11:41:33.387 --> 11:41:40.449]  Because, I mean, those are really talented Russians right there to be able to hack into both and overwhelmingly give it to Trump.
[11:41:40.689 --> 11:41:41.830]  Why aren't they working on this?
[11:41:42.350 --> 11:41:47.432]  This is Hillary Clinton's face right after she got her little baby blood transfusion before the debate tonight.
[11:41:47.492 --> 11:41:49.173]  She did look good tonight.
[11:41:49.333 --> 11:41:52.414]  You know, I did notice in the beginning her nose started to run about
[11:41:53.496 --> 11:41:53.736]  I don't know.
[11:41:53.756 --> 11:41:54.676]  I tweeted it at it sometime.
[11:41:54.696 --> 11:41:55.296]  It was early on.
[11:41:55.697 --> 11:41:58.097]  It was her left nostril started to run.
[11:41:58.117 --> 11:42:01.438]  You could actually see a drip of whatever was coming out of it.
[11:42:01.478 --> 11:42:03.199]  Maybe her life fluid.
[11:42:05.059 --> 11:42:05.919]  But she did manage.
[11:42:05.959 --> 11:42:07.140]  I guess they cut away from her.
[11:42:07.260 --> 11:42:08.100]  She managed to wipe it.
[11:42:08.140 --> 11:42:10.961]  I wonder if anybody got a picture of her, you know, wiping that away.
[11:42:11.001 --> 11:42:12.081]  It's still pneumonia.
[11:42:12.441 --> 11:42:13.621]  Yeah, that's exactly why I wanted to go to.
[11:42:13.661 --> 11:42:17.223]  Real important point here, I mean, you know, this is our guy making, hopefully,
[11:42:41.926 --> 11:42:48.392]  You know, the last stand we're going to have, well I mean I would say hopefully not, but the fact of the matter is, this was go time.
[11:42:48.452 --> 11:42:50.054]  This was the last chance.
[11:42:50.694 --> 11:42:54.318]  Our first amendment of the Constitution is the right to freedom of speech.
[11:42:54.478 --> 11:43:03.867]  I was really hoping that would have been exercised, not only in the presidential sense by the way Trump went about things tonight, but there were so many things left open
[11:43:04.542 --> 11:43:04.742]  Yeah.
[11:43:24.696 --> 11:43:27.459]  Buying for President, I mean, it's a freaking abomination!
[11:43:27.920 --> 11:43:29.962]  And then Haiti got involved, by Hillary.
[11:43:30.402 --> 11:43:34.907]  Yeah, yeah, she sat there and lied and talked about how much she helped Haiti to have 97% of her donations.
[11:43:34.927 --> 11:43:35.888]  That's an outright lie!
[11:43:36.288 --> 11:43:37.049]  An outright lie!
[11:43:37.209 --> 11:43:37.850]  Fact check.
[11:43:38.150 --> 11:43:38.911]  Oh, man.
[11:43:38.991 --> 11:43:39.852]  It's beyond fact check.
[11:43:39.952 --> 11:43:43.276]  And went in to underscore how much help the Haitians needed.
[11:43:43.556 --> 11:43:49.038]  She underscored the fact that she saw, so they needed so much help, yet you didn't give it to them.
[11:43:49.338 --> 11:43:51.218]  And here's the total hypocrisy with the media.
[11:43:51.578 --> 11:44:00.701]  Now with this hurricane and how devastated they are, because you pointed out earlier, since the Clinton Foundation didn't help them with their infrastructure after the last hurricane, this one...
[11:44:03.782 --> 11:44:14.528]  The media isn't even reporting on what's happening there now because they don't want to draw attention to the failure of the Clinton Foundation there the first time around.
[11:44:14.808 --> 11:44:16.789]  We know the media's in cahoots with her.
[11:44:17.589 --> 11:44:20.231]  It's the same reason they don't touch WikiLeaks.
[11:44:20.291 --> 11:44:21.872]  It's because they are indicted.
[11:44:21.932 --> 11:44:24.213]  They're indictable with everything that they do.
[11:44:25.353 --> 11:44:26.514]  Of course they're not going to touch us.
[11:44:26.554 --> 11:44:27.295]  I'm sorry I'm laughing.
[11:44:27.355 --> 11:44:28.076]  It's exhausting.
[11:44:28.236 --> 11:44:29.076]  It's hilarious.
[11:44:29.156 --> 11:44:33.540]  It's so bad that you have to laugh because you're almost on the verge of insanity.
[11:44:33.560 --> 11:44:40.285]  You're almost on the verge of going to the night, like literally trying to keep up this lady's lies, sitting in this room watching you scramble.
[11:44:40.305 --> 11:44:41.646]  We're like, wait a second, wait a second.
[11:44:41.786 --> 11:44:43.768]  Is she going to say anything true tonight at all?
[11:44:44.228 --> 11:44:47.531]  Notice how she never called for her fact checker for anyone to go to her website and
[11:44:47.551 --> 11:44:55.154]  Well, I noticed Chris Wallace was the only one to say, oh, you said some things wrong, Donald, but didn't even correct her on the outright lie about the Clinton Foundation.
[11:44:55.294 --> 11:44:55.754]  Outright lie.
[11:44:56.174 --> 11:44:57.034]  97% total lie.
[11:44:57.315 --> 11:44:57.835]  Total lie.
[11:44:58.055 --> 11:45:03.797]  Well, and the whole time she doesn't answer, she's like, the entire thing was just praising how much the Clinton Foundation does.
[11:45:03.817 --> 11:45:05.497]  It's like, no, answer the question, lady.
[11:45:05.557 --> 11:45:06.618]  Was there pay to play?
[11:45:07.198 --> 11:45:07.598]  Exactly.
[11:45:07.678 --> 11:45:08.899]  Hey, Frank, anything else you want to add?
[11:45:09.739 --> 11:45:10.479]  Yeah, real quick.
[11:45:10.519 --> 11:45:11.460]  This will be the last thing.
[11:45:12.748 --> 11:45:14.469]  Leanne, I just want to level with you on this.
[11:45:14.509 --> 11:45:29.013]  Get Pachenek on tomorrow because I am really feeling like Trump could have completely blown this thing out of the water by going after the fact points hard at Hillary and then countering with his stance, his solutions.
[11:45:29.413 --> 11:45:38.036]  But I honestly got to say, from the second debate, when the random question was asked, what they do admire about each other, my gut tells me
[11:45:38.686 --> 11:45:39.786]  Well, I admire his children.
[11:46:05.957 --> 11:46:09.298]  No, I can see what you're saying right there.
[11:46:10.739 --> 11:46:12.619]  Hillary is good friends with Ivanka.
[11:46:12.639 --> 11:46:17.801]  That's an easy end for anything to happen in that regard.
[11:46:18.341 --> 11:46:20.262]  As disgusting as it would be
[11:46:21.062 --> 11:46:22.563]  I wouldn't put anything past the Clintons.
[11:46:22.583 --> 11:46:25.126]  They're some dirty people.
[11:46:25.166 --> 11:46:31.451]  I mean, that's one of the main reasons why you have a lot of Secret Service and a lot of other, you know, spies or whatever.
[11:46:31.471 --> 11:46:37.576]  They don't tend to have families with children because they know that that's going to be their ultimate weakness, their ultimate target.
[11:46:38.317 --> 11:46:41.339]  That's why most of your presidents got to get in with people that they fear.
[11:46:42.847 --> 11:46:54.773]  Well, and tonight we showed the video, or earlier this afternoon, about 3.15 or so, I showed this whole montage that I put together of creepy Joe Biden groping little girls in these photo ops, like in front of everybody.
[11:46:54.853 --> 11:46:59.995]  He's grabbing little girls, putting his hand around their waist, grabbing them, stroking their hair.
[11:47:00.496 --> 11:47:03.157]  Why did that have to be such an exceptionally long video?
[11:47:03.257 --> 11:47:04.898]  It was so long and so creepy.
[11:47:05.018 --> 11:47:06.098]  And that's not even all of it.
[11:47:06.138 --> 11:47:07.359]  That's probably not
[11:47:08.413 --> 11:47:11.434]  A tenth of what Joe Biden has caught on camera doing.
[11:47:11.554 --> 11:47:13.035]  Who knows what he's like off camera.
[11:47:13.835 --> 11:47:14.495]  Disgusting.
[11:47:15.415 --> 11:47:21.798]  Let's not forget that it was Poppy Bush, mainstream news there, shipping the little boys in.
[11:47:22.358 --> 11:47:24.578]  So, this is the kind of people we're dealing with.
[11:47:25.039 --> 11:47:25.779]  To the White House!
[11:47:26.139 --> 11:47:26.319]  Yeah.
[11:47:27.519 --> 11:47:29.620]  It was George Bush and the Midnight Cowboys.
[11:47:30.200 --> 11:47:32.761]  Hey, before we go to our next caller, thanks for calling, Frank.
[11:47:33.261 --> 11:47:36.743]  Before we go to our next caller, we got about an hour and 13 minutes left.
[11:47:38.677 --> 11:47:41.759]  Until the end of this, this 13 hours that we've been covering live.
[11:47:42.439 --> 11:47:43.680]  We do this for you guys out there.
[11:47:43.980 --> 11:47:45.361]  We'll ask for your support.
[11:47:45.721 --> 11:47:50.123]  One way to do it is by spreading the word about the free link, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[11:47:50.143 --> 11:47:52.805]  Another way is get the app, InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[11:47:52.845 --> 11:47:53.605]  Both of those are free.
[11:47:54.025 --> 11:47:58.408]  Another way you can support us financially is going to InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[11:47:58.768 --> 11:47:59.748]  Right now we have Brain Force 25% off.
[11:48:01.249 --> 11:48:01.589]  We're good.
[11:48:21.118 --> 11:48:21.218]  Yeah.
[11:48:51.618 --> 11:48:52.718]  All the time, until you need to.
[11:48:52.759 --> 11:48:58.060]  But there are some times when you have to pull an overnighter, and sometimes you've got to get the job done, and BrainForce helped me get the job done.
[11:48:58.580 --> 11:49:16.926]  So, and I've taken it since then, you know, usually not for going all night, in terms of staying up all night and doing things, but to get up in the morning, you don't want to get coffee, or if you don't have coffee, BrainForce is just as good, and it's definitely better, I think, better for you than what you're putting in your body with coffee, with all the caffeine.
[11:49:17.674 --> 11:49:24.277]  And also, we have the Hillary for Prison t-shirt at cost right now, $9.95.
[11:49:25.678 --> 11:49:26.578]  So, still get those.
[11:49:26.638 --> 11:49:27.519]  Once they're gone, they're gone.
[11:49:27.639 --> 11:49:28.039]  That's it.
[11:49:28.159 --> 11:49:31.381]  Version 3, 50% off for a limited time and free domestic shipping.
[11:49:31.521 --> 11:49:38.504]  I feel like that's going to be a collector's item in the future because it lets people know that you were awake during this election.
[11:49:38.844 --> 11:49:43.847]  You weren't one of the people that was totally duped by the massive PSYOP campaign happening in 2016.
[11:49:45.027 --> 11:49:49.931]  And everybody's wearing red on election day, so get your Trump is my President t-shirt.
[11:49:49.951 --> 11:49:53.153]  We got those just in stock just today, I think.
[11:49:53.193 --> 11:49:54.033]  So they just came in.
[11:49:54.154 --> 11:49:55.755]  Did you show you showed one on camera today?
[11:49:55.895 --> 11:49:56.195]  I did.
[11:49:56.215 --> 11:49:57.256]  A couple floating around here.
[11:49:58.717 --> 11:49:59.057]  There it is.
[11:49:59.177 --> 11:50:01.058]  And you know, we have free shipping.
[11:50:01.238 --> 11:50:05.001]  Don't argue with the people at the polls when they tell you to turn them inside out.
[11:50:05.041 --> 11:50:06.822]  They might, depending on the state you live in.
[11:50:07.223 --> 11:50:08.924]  So acquiesce.
[11:50:09.537 --> 11:50:11.539]  Well, especially in the city of Austin, they might.
[11:50:11.599 --> 11:50:12.680]  Yeah, they might.
[11:50:12.760 --> 11:50:15.122]  And then ask them, hey, how do we count these ballots here?
[11:50:15.142 --> 11:50:16.603]  How do we know these are safe?
[11:50:16.623 --> 11:50:17.984]  Where's the government accountability?
[11:50:18.004 --> 11:50:19.566]  You know, do I get a receipt?
[11:50:19.666 --> 11:50:20.647]  No, you're not going to see that.
[11:50:20.947 --> 11:50:28.513]  So, go to infowars.com, infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, infowars.com forward slash show for the free links.
[11:50:28.734 --> 11:50:30.575]  And we've been going, what?
[11:50:31.676 --> 11:50:31.996]  What is it?
[11:50:32.476 --> 11:50:33.357]  11 hours and 50 minutes.
[11:50:33.977 --> 11:50:34.377]  Yeah.
[11:50:34.477 --> 11:50:36.618]  Don't make me do math right now, please.
[11:50:36.738 --> 11:50:40.820]  It's already not my strong suit, even with the brain force that I'm on right now.
[11:50:41.020 --> 11:50:41.280]  There you go.
[11:50:41.300 --> 11:50:42.501]  We've got another caller from Florida.
[11:50:42.541 --> 11:50:45.482]  Matt, let's talk about the Facebook feed debate.
[11:50:45.562 --> 11:50:46.503]  What was going on in Facebook?
[11:50:48.143 --> 11:50:48.964]  Hey guys.
[11:50:49.224 --> 11:50:51.005]  Well, thank you for having me on the show.
[11:50:51.065 --> 11:50:55.767]  And I just want to say thank you for doing this long show here for us today.
[11:50:55.787 --> 11:50:56.567]  I know it's hard work.
[11:50:56.767 --> 11:50:59.409]  How much have you watched?
[11:50:59.489 --> 11:51:00.169]  Actually, the whole day.
[11:51:01.154 --> 11:51:01.354]  Nice!
[11:51:01.514 --> 11:51:03.335]  Since you guys are broadcasting.
[11:51:03.555 --> 11:51:05.336]  Well, hopefully we've been entertaining you.
[11:51:05.856 --> 11:51:08.558]  We're viewers too, when we're not doing this.
[11:51:08.718 --> 11:51:10.078]  We're viewers too.
[11:51:11.399 --> 11:51:22.624]  Yeah, actually, I had some concerns and questions, so I've just been kind of monitoring social media since this whole thing with Trump and Clinton.
[11:51:23.404 --> 11:51:29.027]  And, you know, we all have families that are on different sides of the political spectrum, and I'm really glad that
[11:51:30.256 --> 11:51:37.322]  You know, that, of course, Trump did as well as he did in the debate, as that gives me a lot more confidence, of course, that I'm going to vote for him now.
[11:51:38.442 --> 11:51:48.330]  But I guess just seeing kind of some of the things with with the violence that's been occurring at protests and some of the things that have been occurring against Trump supporters.
[11:51:48.570 --> 11:51:55.596]  My concern is regardless of what happens with these elections after the elections, I guess
[11:51:56.295 --> 11:51:58.718]  My overall concern is what will happen.
[11:51:58.998 --> 11:52:02.301]  Will we see more increases in violent attacks?
[11:52:03.122 --> 11:52:16.995]  Will we see a situation perhaps, for example, what happened in Venezuela where you had the people who were trying to essentially get capitalists back in power and the socialists didn't respect it and they're suppressing their rights.
[11:52:17.776 --> 11:52:18.737]  Will we see martial law?
[11:52:19.238 --> 11:52:20.499]  I just kind of want your opinion on that.
[11:52:20.859 --> 11:52:37.109]  Well let's not forget it was just a few years ago that they enacted, they took everyone's guns just what was it four years ago there and they said they did it because they were just they wanted peace in the country and this is how we're going to do it is we're going to confiscate everybody turn your guns in for peace.
[11:52:37.489 --> 11:52:39.471]  No they saw the writing on the wall and they knew that
[11:52:40.511 --> 11:52:43.513]  The stuff was going to hit the fan and they didn't want people to be armed.
[11:52:43.934 --> 11:52:47.296]  Now the only people that have arms are police and criminals.
[11:52:47.697 --> 11:52:52.300]  And if you are the police, you're getting you're getting beat down in the streets and getting your guns taken by the criminals.
[11:52:53.361 --> 11:52:56.203]  We're talking about your question was, do you think that could happen here?
[11:52:56.263 --> 11:53:02.127]  Do we think that we could see an economic collapse happen here to the point where people are hijacking trucks of meat and eating raw meat in the streets?
[11:53:02.367 --> 11:53:02.668]  Yes.
[11:53:03.348 --> 11:53:04.389]  Yes, of course.
[11:53:04.409 --> 11:53:07.012]  I bet they didn't think it could happen there.
[11:53:07.393 --> 11:53:07.973]  Of course not.
[11:53:08.033 --> 11:53:15.001]  Well, Venezuela is a one-trick pony when it comes to oil, but unlike ours, we're talking about money that's already heavily inflated.
[11:53:15.021 --> 11:53:17.844]  We're talking about a candidate that's going to sell us down the river to China.
[11:53:17.864 --> 11:53:20.968]  A possible recession like we've never seen.
[11:53:21.488 --> 11:53:22.610]  Yes, we could see that here.
[11:53:23.168 --> 11:53:33.336]  I think if you have an economic collapse at the same time as false riots are started by provocateurs like Black Lives Matter, you notice they're being quiet right now?
[11:53:33.576 --> 11:53:40.962]  You notice they're not poking their heads up like at one of these Trump events or any of these debates.
[11:53:41.002 --> 11:53:42.043]  They're not showing up right now.
[11:53:42.363 --> 11:53:43.684]  Because they've been told to stand down.
[11:53:43.744 --> 11:53:44.465]  They've been told to wait.
[11:53:44.685 --> 11:53:46.966]  Because if Trump wins, they will be activated.
[11:53:47.307 --> 11:53:50.950]  And they will start violence across this country, especially in the big cities.
[11:53:51.710 --> 11:53:56.375]  And you're going to see, you know, looting, vandalism, fires.
[11:53:57.496 --> 11:54:04.703]  And if you have it happen in enough places, well, then Obama can declare a state of emergency, you know, across.
[11:54:04.823 --> 11:54:09.788]  I don't think he'll do it across the nation, but in certain states and in certain cities, you can see it happening in National Guard moving in.
[11:54:10.168 --> 11:54:12.390]  And then it depends on where people take it from there.
[11:54:12.410 --> 11:54:13.852]  Are people going to.
[11:54:14.953 --> 11:54:17.675]  Let the law and order reign supreme.
[11:54:17.695 --> 11:54:21.618]  It's going to happen in the cities mostly because most of the people aren't armed in the city.
[11:54:22.019 --> 11:54:22.980]  Thugs can run wild.
[11:54:23.400 --> 11:54:24.261]  Thugs have guns.
[11:54:25.682 --> 11:54:27.463]  And I don't mean that in a black or white sense.
[11:54:27.483 --> 11:54:30.706]  All the people that are going to be running around breaking things are thugs.
[11:54:30.866 --> 11:54:34.610]  Anyone who plays video games knows the first thing you do is get guns and ammo.
[11:54:34.650 --> 11:54:35.350]  That's what you need.
[11:54:36.431 --> 11:54:40.594]  In those days, and a lot of people are going to be thugs, you know, a lot of people.
[11:54:40.975 --> 11:54:42.095]  That's just what it is.
[11:54:42.135 --> 11:54:43.557]  And so I think that's kind of the key thing.
[11:54:43.717 --> 11:54:51.403]  If they are able, if Hillary Clinton gets in and she is able to convince people that the right thing to do is to turn in your guns, you know it's on.
[11:54:51.823 --> 11:54:58.588]  Have you guys seen in police departments, like especially in major cities like LA, you could get a grocery card by handing over your weapon.
[11:54:58.788 --> 11:55:00.049]  That's pretty common stuff.
[11:55:00.149 --> 11:55:04.913]  So you could get a $200 gift card for groceries, right, if you just hand over your gun.
[11:55:05.413 --> 11:55:09.635]  Look at how good a job the government in Venezuela is doing feeding their people now that they've turned in their guns.
[11:55:09.675 --> 11:55:10.215]  Precisely.
[11:55:10.235 --> 11:55:10.895]  Wow.
[11:55:11.416 --> 11:55:13.076]  Yeah, hey Matt, thanks for calling.
[11:55:13.096 --> 11:55:13.837]  That was great insight.
[11:55:13.857 --> 11:55:19.819]  We got Robert in Pennsylvania wants to talk about the guy we were just talking about who picked up the notes off Hillary Clinton's podium and then stood behind her.
[11:55:20.279 --> 11:55:22.000]  Notice how this time he didn't exit the stage.
[11:55:22.040 --> 11:55:24.701]  Yeah, I did see him tonight, but he did this again?
[11:55:24.721 --> 11:55:27.962]  Yeah, he was standing behind her and also the guy with the EpiPen.
[11:55:28.122 --> 11:55:30.403]  They were both standing behind her while she was talking to people.
[11:55:31.244 --> 11:55:32.044]  It's totally normal.
[11:55:32.484 --> 11:55:33.245]  Yeah.
[11:55:33.265 --> 11:55:34.245]  Go ahead, Robert.
[11:55:35.051 --> 11:55:35.992]  Hi Rob, ladies.
[11:55:36.673 --> 11:55:39.658]  You were talking about that Joe Biden clip you did earlier.
[11:55:39.698 --> 11:55:45.226]  I happened to catch that and it just made me pop in my head, but just imagine some of the stuff he was whispering to those girls.
[11:55:45.546 --> 11:55:47.249]  It's creepy how he was doing that.
[11:55:47.856 --> 11:55:49.437]  But that's completely off topic.
[11:55:50.517 --> 11:55:52.739]  First time caller, long time listener, love you guys.
[11:55:53.319 --> 11:55:58.361]  I was talking to my buddy during a debate, and after it was over, I noticed a guy, he went to actually Trump's podium.
[11:55:58.381 --> 11:56:00.643]  I even asked my friend, like, did you notice that?
[11:56:01.023 --> 11:56:04.064]  He picked up Trump's notepad, and like, he did it so weird.
[11:56:04.084 --> 11:56:07.386]  He looked at it, and he looked at Trump, and at that time, Trump's back was to him.
[11:56:07.866 --> 11:56:10.067]  He looked back down at the notepad and heard him scurry off.
[11:56:10.648 --> 11:56:15.190]  He just reminded me of that weasel from the very first debate, when that happened with Hillary.
[11:56:17.517 --> 11:56:17.857]  Weasel.
[11:56:18.037 --> 11:56:19.179]  He was very Weasel-y.
[11:56:19.199 --> 11:56:21.200]  Yeah, and what was he doing there?
[11:56:21.561 --> 11:56:27.547]  Now, I had already gone off to do some reports when that happened, so I didn't see it happening tonight, but I wanted everyone to pay attention.
[11:56:27.587 --> 11:56:28.948]  Are we going to see this again tonight?
[11:56:28.968 --> 11:56:33.752]  And of course, that's only going to be... He grabbed her notes and he walked around with them right behind her, and he stood behind her the whole time.
[11:56:34.053 --> 11:56:39.898]  He kind of walked off stage like he was leaving, and then he ended up, the next camera shot I saw Hillary, he was standing right behind her.
[11:56:40.299 --> 11:56:41.420]  So he was some kind of assistant.
[11:56:41.440 --> 11:56:42.541]  I don't think he's Secret Service.
[11:56:43.001 --> 11:56:51.603]  But did anyone notice that, however, since, you know, everyone kind of pointed out Hillary giving her hand signals in that one debate, she hasn't done that yet?
[11:56:51.763 --> 11:56:54.044]  And she hasn't gotten any zingers since then.
[11:56:54.064 --> 11:56:54.524]  No box either.
[11:56:54.544 --> 11:56:55.164]  No good debates.
[11:56:55.824 --> 11:57:01.385]  No box on the back either, with a cord going up the back, which it was really looking... I was kind of hoping to see that.
[11:57:01.585 --> 11:57:04.826]  Could it have been that Mal outfit, though?
[11:57:05.286 --> 11:57:05.887]  Yeah, that's true.
[11:57:05.927 --> 11:57:06.807]  I wonder if that was a gift.
[11:57:09.727 --> 11:57:10.587]  Yeah, it is interesting.
[11:57:10.627 --> 11:57:11.608]  Who knows who that guy is.
[11:57:11.668 --> 11:57:12.648]  I'm sure it'll come out eventually.
[11:57:12.668 --> 11:57:13.729]  He probably has a Twitter feed.
[11:57:14.069 --> 11:57:15.229]  He'll be like, it's just my job.
[11:57:15.249 --> 11:57:16.210]  I'm just doing it.
[11:57:16.450 --> 11:57:20.111]  He's Hillary's paper jockey.
[11:57:20.492 --> 11:57:25.014]  Yeah, well at least he's not the guy who has to empty out her toilet on her bus.
[11:57:25.094 --> 11:57:25.894]  Or groom of the stool.
[11:57:25.914 --> 11:57:26.634]  Did you see that?
[11:57:27.435 --> 11:57:31.156]  Emptying out in the streets the stooler waste?
[11:57:31.416 --> 11:57:33.077]  That just tells you what they're going to do to the country.
[11:57:33.457 --> 11:57:35.138]  They really are going to crap all over us.
[11:57:35.856 --> 11:57:38.357]  Because they have no concept of decency.
[11:57:38.737 --> 11:57:40.678]  You know, all you gotta do is go to a pump station down the road.
[11:57:40.758 --> 11:57:46.801]  Yeah, and of course they blamed it on the bus operators, but you're the ones that went in the latrine.
[11:57:46.861 --> 11:57:50.363]  They pulled right up to the sewer and tried to dump it in the sewer.
[11:57:51.493 --> 11:57:52.673]  But they care about the environment.
[11:57:52.774 --> 11:57:55.395]  These are the climate change people.
[11:57:55.655 --> 11:57:56.775]  They care about our water.
[11:57:56.855 --> 11:58:02.537]  In fact, I tweeted out one of their quotes was, we apologize for any damage we may have caused.
[11:58:03.238 --> 11:58:07.900]  And I finished their sentence, because usually we don't get caught unless it's by a WikiLeaks dump.
[11:58:08.140 --> 11:58:10.120]  But we'll make sure the taxpayers pay for it.
[11:58:10.341 --> 11:58:11.381]  Yeah, exactly.
[11:58:11.401 --> 11:58:13.162]  And it has Matt out there.
[11:58:13.182 --> 11:58:16.103]  All right, Robert, thanks for calling.
[11:58:16.123 --> 11:58:17.363]  We got Rich in Wisconsin.
[11:58:17.383 --> 11:58:18.864]  Let's talk about the debate performance.
[11:58:18.904 --> 11:58:19.764]  Go ahead, Rich.
[11:58:20.144 --> 11:58:21.085]  How's Wisconsin going?
[11:58:22.393 --> 11:58:24.133]  A little cold up here.
[11:58:24.233 --> 11:58:25.194]  I think we'll manage though.
[11:58:25.234 --> 11:58:29.734]  But I want to talk a little bit about Hillary's choice of wardrobe this evening.
[11:58:29.794 --> 11:58:31.935]  You didn't like that?
[11:58:33.255 --> 11:58:43.017]  I think we've seen a progression from, let's say, the Red Menace to the giant suit to now, she kind of looks like the Pope, or as I would like to refer to her as the Poop.
[11:58:44.157 --> 11:58:46.958]  I just thought it was just kind of odd.
[11:58:47.058 --> 11:58:47.578]  Obviously,
[11:58:48.542 --> 11:58:52.505]  Trump going with something a little bit more traditional, red tie, totally fine with that.
[11:58:52.585 --> 11:59:04.052]  But Hillary kind of gave me that holier-than-thou kind of vibe tonight, and she seemed a little bit more ornery, like a frightened cat, if you would.
[11:59:04.652 --> 11:59:07.434]  So I was just kind of caught off guard by that.
[11:59:07.494 --> 11:59:11.677]  She seemed a little bit more vicious than usual, but Trump still laid into her pretty well.
[11:59:12.714 --> 11:59:15.817]  I thought she seemed really contained, not as vicious to me.
[11:59:15.877 --> 11:59:18.059]  She seemed so contained tonight.
[11:59:18.079 --> 11:59:21.002]  There was so much that has come out that could destroy her.
[11:59:21.102 --> 11:59:22.323]  That's why she was so triggered.
[11:59:22.343 --> 11:59:24.545]  I don't know if you noticed her new highlights.
[11:59:24.665 --> 11:59:26.227]  She was so heavily highlighted.
[11:59:26.627 --> 11:59:27.628]  She almost had a halo.
[11:59:28.008 --> 11:59:30.891]  How many Chairman Mao suits does she have in her closet?
[11:59:30.911 --> 11:59:30.891]  50?
[11:59:31.031 --> 11:59:33.773]  I don't even want to think about that.
[11:59:33.793 --> 11:59:34.634]  She's got at least 50.
[11:59:36.314 --> 11:59:39.476]  You know, it was interesting who was whining about Russia today.
[11:59:39.496 --> 11:59:39.936]  It was Hillary.
[11:59:39.956 --> 11:59:42.157]  You know, Obama said stop whining about these rigged elections.
[11:59:42.177 --> 11:59:47.621]  Guys, if you can get that clip queued up, I think to 118, about Trump.
[11:59:47.661 --> 11:59:50.682]  He says, stop whining about your rigged elections!
[11:59:51.643 --> 11:59:53.124]  And when we go to that clip...
[11:59:53.604 --> 11:59:58.446]  I think Margaret's gonna check out and go shoot a couple more reports and Joe Biggs is waiting in the wings.
[11:59:58.486 --> 11:59:59.386]  I think I might check out too.
[11:59:59.406 --> 12:00:07.449]  I'm still editing some stuff, some highlights from tonight's show and putting them up and we'll just leave you and Biggs to it and then if I need to come back in, I'll come back in a little bit.
[12:00:07.569 --> 12:00:08.149]  What about Owen?
[12:00:08.949 --> 12:00:10.551]  I was shooting reports.
[12:00:10.871 --> 12:00:12.832]  We got reports going up the Alex Jones Channel right now.
[12:00:12.872 --> 12:00:14.974]  We are working hard for you guys out there.
[12:00:14.994 --> 12:00:18.037]  Just want to leave you guys with that.
[12:00:18.077 --> 12:00:20.339]  Check your state registries if it hasn't passed.
[12:00:20.399 --> 12:00:21.179]  Be sure and register.
[12:00:21.219 --> 12:00:22.501]  November 8th is the day.
[12:00:22.881 --> 12:00:28.065]  Your vote does matter because if it didn't, they wouldn't be doing all of this to stop us.
[12:00:28.165 --> 12:00:29.086]  You guys have that clip ready?
[12:00:31.288 --> 12:00:32.629]  Okay, let's roll it.
[12:00:32.669 --> 12:00:33.190]  This is Obama.
[12:00:33.210 --> 12:00:34.791]  Stop whining people about election fraud.
[12:00:34.811 --> 12:00:35.672]  Stop whining.
[12:00:37.105 --> 12:00:58.683]  I have never seen in my lifetime or modern political history any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place.
[12:01:00.925 --> 12:01:01.686]  It's unprecedented.
[12:01:04.850 --> 12:01:06.891]  It happens to be based on no facts.
[12:01:09.792 --> 12:01:30.982]  Every expert, regardless of political party, regardless of ideology, conservative or liberal, who has ever examined these issues in a serious way will tell you that instances of significant voter fraud are not to be found.
[12:01:33.724 --> 12:01:33.984]  That
[12:01:36.112 --> 12:01:53.321]  Keep in mind, elections are run by state and local officials, which means that there are places like Florida, for example, where you've got a Republican governor whose Republican appointees are going to be running and monitoring a whole bunch of these election sites.
[12:01:53.381 --> 12:02:02.886]  The notion that somehow if Mr. Trump loses Florida, it's because of those people that you have to watch out for, that is
[12:02:04.795 --> 12:02:05.896]  Both irresponsible?
[12:02:08.318 --> 12:02:16.004]  And by the way, doesn't really show the kind of leadership and toughness that you'd want out of a president.
[12:02:16.944 --> 12:02:18.826]  You start whining before the game's even over?
[12:02:24.290 --> 12:02:28.233]  If whenever things are going badly for you and you lose, you start blaming somebody else?
[12:02:30.235 --> 12:02:31.956]  Then you don't have what it takes to be in this job.
[12:02:34.226 --> 12:02:37.848]  Because there are a lot of times when things don't go our way or my way.
[12:02:42.209 --> 12:02:42.770]  That's okay.
[12:02:43.070 --> 12:02:43.770]  You fight through it.
[12:02:43.890 --> 12:02:44.571]  You work through it.
[12:02:45.551 --> 12:02:46.691]  You try to accomplish your goals.
[12:02:49.173 --> 12:02:59.077]  But the larger point that I want to emphasize here is that there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that
[12:03:00.427 --> 12:03:11.271]  You could even rig America's elections in part because they're so decentralized and the numbers of votes involved.
[12:03:11.351 --> 12:03:18.814]  There's no evidence that that has happened in the past or that there are instances in which that will happen this time.
[12:03:20.235 --> 12:03:25.957]  And so I'd invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes.
[12:03:28.565 --> 12:03:35.987]  And of course, right after this, Obama was whining about the fact that a reporter dared ask him a question that was not approved.
[12:03:36.947 --> 12:03:45.210]  And O'Keefe pretty much proved that there is election fraud going on and that this election can be stolen via all kinds of DNC trickery.
[12:03:45.570 --> 12:03:46.910]  What does that even mean?
[12:03:47.110 --> 12:03:49.431]  Well, I want to go to something that's very important.
[12:03:49.771 --> 12:03:54.252]  They actually talked about the border situation, how it's wide open and immigration and
[12:03:55.123 --> 12:04:05.729]  Wallace actually looks at Hillary and goes, well didn't you say via one of these exposed or one of these Wikileaks emails that you dream of open borders?
[12:04:06.409 --> 12:04:07.510]  And what does Hillary Clinton do?
[12:04:07.550 --> 12:04:12.873]  She pivots to how Wikileaks is run by the Russians and it's Putin's fault.
[12:04:13.213 --> 12:04:14.094]  And I tweeted this out.
[12:04:14.614 --> 12:04:21.418]  Blaming exposed government corruption on Russian hackers doesn't mean that government corruption hasn't been exposed.
[12:04:21.978 --> 12:04:27.622]  So regardless of the fact, it doesn't matter who in the hell released those emails, who hacked it, guess what?
[12:04:28.042 --> 12:04:32.445]  It exposed government corruption, plain and simple, black and white.
[12:04:32.505 --> 12:04:33.505]  It is that easy.
[12:04:33.825 --> 12:04:36.307]  I don't care if the Cookie Monster did it.
[12:04:37.048 --> 12:04:48.755]  Right, well that's the thing that she's continually saying, the DNC is continually saying, don't worry about the contents of the emails and what was exposed, we need to focus on the fact that the Russians did it.
[12:04:48.855 --> 12:04:50.336]  And why all of a sudden the Russians?
[12:04:50.376 --> 12:04:53.898]  It's because they want to frighten people, but young people aren't
[12:04:54.258 --> 12:04:54.338]  It's
[12:05:14.540 --> 12:05:18.763]  I think those 17 agencies appeared during one of her dreams for open borders.
[12:05:20.084 --> 12:05:21.485]  I mean, that's pretty much what happened.
[12:05:21.505 --> 12:05:24.907]  I mean, and then she goes on and says, well, I am for border security.
[12:05:25.448 --> 12:05:35.274]  Meanwhile, what she really means is she wants to bring in unvetted Syrian refugees into our country and start and create the jobs and make the economy better in Detroit by bringing those people in there.
[12:05:35.294 --> 12:05:36.655]  That's a good idea.
[12:05:37.035 --> 12:05:39.977]  Somebody actually responded to my tweet about it.
[12:05:39.997 --> 12:05:43.000]  They're like, well, Star Trek believes in open borders.
[12:05:44.531 --> 12:05:47.953]  So, you know, we don't need your backwards ideas.
[12:05:48.013 --> 12:05:49.694]  And it's like, sure, fine.
[12:05:49.794 --> 12:05:58.358]  If our human race advances to a point where we are a galactic society and we have our galactic government that's helping us.
[12:05:58.418 --> 12:05:59.379]  I'm going to print some nerdiness on here.
[12:05:59.919 --> 12:06:02.760]  They also had machines that made food out of thin air.
[12:06:02.780 --> 12:06:07.563]  Like, if we could do that and we could feed everybody, then sure.
[12:06:07.623 --> 12:06:10.384]  3D printing is trying to make you a hamburger right now.
[12:06:10.404 --> 12:06:11.805]  No, it still uses resources.
[12:06:12.585 --> 12:06:20.630]  Well, Hillary goes on to say, well, my opponent talks about how he says that there's rapists that come across the border, that they're criminals, that they're thieves.
[12:06:20.670 --> 12:06:21.410]  Well, guess what?
[12:06:22.051 --> 12:06:24.252]  If you look at the facts, that is happening.
[12:06:24.332 --> 12:06:32.577]  Well, the fact is, when he said that, he was the only person running for president who had actually gone to visit the border.
[12:06:32.597 --> 12:06:34.278]  This is right around the time you actually went there.
[12:06:34.298 --> 12:06:39.201]  Yes, it was the day before in Laredo when we caught the massive shipment of drugs coming across the Rio Grande River.
[12:06:39.221 --> 12:06:39.982]  It was Josh Owens.
[12:06:40.042 --> 12:06:40.462]  Exactly.
[12:06:40.822 --> 12:06:44.703]  And he was the President Obama came to Texas, but he went to Dallas.
[12:06:44.783 --> 12:06:45.924]  He didn't even go to the border.
[12:06:46.164 --> 12:06:47.424]  Hillary Clinton didn't go to the border.
[12:06:47.744 --> 12:06:49.085]  No one else has gone to the border.
[12:06:49.225 --> 12:06:52.546]  But Donald Trump, he has spoken with the Border Patrol agents.
[12:06:52.586 --> 12:06:54.326]  That's why they actually backed him.
[12:06:54.446 --> 12:06:55.487]  And I've never done that.
[12:06:55.887 --> 12:06:57.447]  And so he did see.
[12:06:57.728 --> 12:06:59.508]  And so, yeah, I think everybody can agree.
[12:06:59.668 --> 12:07:01.489]  Donald Trump has he's like an exact.
[12:07:01.549 --> 12:07:02.289]  He's like, it's great.
[12:07:02.329 --> 12:07:03.309]  It's huge.
[12:07:03.649 --> 12:07:04.410]  He exaggerates.
[12:07:05.570 --> 12:07:06.611]  It's still the truth.
[12:07:06.751 --> 12:07:10.132]  And he went there, saw it with his own eyes, talked to these people.
[12:07:10.232 --> 12:07:11.653]  And he played our video.
[12:07:11.973 --> 12:07:20.736]  That they're being housed in, seeing the fact that they're allowing in these children up to 30 years of age who are covered in gang tattoos.
[12:07:21.316 --> 12:07:30.300]  I mean, we just had someone who was a body that was found burning in a dumpster in San Antonio, Texas, with their hands and feet chopped off.
[12:07:30.660 --> 12:07:32.120]  Total cartel activity.
[12:07:32.541 --> 12:07:37.442]  We have kind of a cartel war brewing just about 40 miles away from here.
[12:07:37.462 --> 12:07:39.083]  I mean, this is serious.
[12:07:39.463 --> 12:07:41.043]  It's not just over the border.
[12:07:41.143 --> 12:07:42.844]  It's already getting into our country.
[12:07:43.184 --> 12:07:54.767]  And our president and Hillary Clinton doesn't want to talk about it because they know it's going to take- You got Hillary's buddy Sean Penn going and meeting with El Chapo and hanging out with these guys.
[12:07:54.787 --> 12:07:56.128]  So of course they want the borders wide open.
[12:07:56.148 --> 12:07:59.609]  They want El Chapo to come in here and chop people's heads off and hang them from overpasses.
[12:08:00.069 --> 12:08:04.532]  He wants kids to die from heroin overdoses that they're cutting with elephant tranquilizers.
[12:08:04.892 --> 12:08:10.696]  It's totally fine that we have massive amounts of people ODing from heroin because of this drug war we're fighting.
[12:08:10.956 --> 12:08:19.261]  So after Hillary goes, you know, Trump says that there's rapists and all these people coming across the board, he goes, yeah, we have some bad hombres here and we're going to get them the hell out of here.
[12:08:19.642 --> 12:08:21.843]  I mean, that was an awesome part in the whole debate.
[12:08:21.963 --> 12:08:27.026]  But see, the bad hombres thing, you see Hillary's face when he said that because
[12:08:28.149 --> 12:08:35.114]  For him using that sort of parlance, she was kind of checking and she looked like, is that racist?
[12:08:35.174 --> 12:08:36.274]  Should he have done that?
[12:08:36.374 --> 12:08:37.575]  Yeah, she's trying to find some ammo.
[12:08:37.595 --> 12:08:41.778]  I guarantee you she is going to spin that into him being racist.
[12:08:41.898 --> 12:08:44.880]  I guarantee you she's going to have a video up on her site.
[12:08:45.220 --> 12:08:46.181]  You heard it here first.
[12:08:47.321 --> 12:08:47.962]  Check me on that.
[12:08:48.686 --> 12:08:51.449]  I thought that Wallace did an outstanding job tonight.
[12:08:51.489 --> 12:08:58.216]  From what we've seen in the other moderators thus far, I thought he fairly hammered both people.
[12:08:58.957 --> 12:09:04.062]  And he asked equally hard questions to both of them and gave them time to respond.
[12:09:04.142 --> 12:09:05.523]  And if either one of them kind of
[12:09:06.297 --> 12:09:06.817]  We're good to go.
[12:09:29.125 --> 12:09:36.648]  So I laughed when I heard that because you're saying you stand up for a Supreme Court that's going to take care of the people, abide by the law, hold people accountable.
[12:09:36.949 --> 12:09:41.651]  The same kind of Supreme Court that have your ass in jail right now for your email scandal.
[12:09:41.971 --> 12:09:45.512]  So you're telling me right now that you're really going to put in some people that are going to put you in jail.
[12:09:45.573 --> 12:09:46.593]  No, you're not going to.
[12:09:46.893 --> 12:09:52.796]  You're going to put in someone just as corrupt as you in the Supreme Court so you can be a snake and slither around like you always do.
[12:09:53.915 --> 12:10:01.738]  If James Comey would have recused himself, which he should have done, same with the Attorney General, should have recused herself because they have personal friendships with them.
[12:10:02.418 --> 12:10:05.740]  But you notice how in that she never once mentioned the Constitution.
[12:10:06.320 --> 12:10:08.801]  She never once mentioned protecting the Second Amendment.
[12:10:08.841 --> 12:10:10.181]  And that was what the question was about.
[12:10:10.301 --> 12:10:13.162]  How would you bring someone in who is going to uphold the Constitution?
[12:10:13.542 --> 12:10:15.163]  She never mentioned that.
[12:10:15.623 --> 12:10:20.305]  And also, you know, was that public or private, Hillary, answering that question?
[12:10:20.465 --> 12:10:22.686]  But she brought up the gun show loophole.
[12:10:24.710 --> 12:10:29.174]  Well, because I'm someone who goes to gun shows quite often, and I own a lot of guns, I love to shoot.
[12:10:29.474 --> 12:10:38.601]  The Second Amendment is a very fun thing for me, and I enjoy it for hunting and for the ability to protect myself, my property, my family, you know.
[12:10:39.322 --> 12:10:41.163]  And she talks about how there's this loophole.
[12:10:41.503 --> 12:10:42.544]  Well, that's nonsense!
[12:10:42.905 --> 12:10:45.286]  You have to go to a gun show
[12:10:45.947 --> 12:10:46.147]  I don't
[12:11:00.964 --> 12:11:03.646]  I mean, you understand that, a lot of our viewers understand that.
[12:11:03.686 --> 12:11:10.352]  Hillary Clinton is counting on dumbed down compliant citizenry who doesn't know, who isn't a gun aficionado.
[12:11:10.392 --> 12:11:11.773]  They don't understand what this is.
[12:11:12.373 --> 12:11:16.717]  And so they just think that there's people out there selling guns willy-nilly, whatever.
[12:11:16.797 --> 12:11:25.084]  I mean, meanwhile, Facebook is allowing ISIS accounts to sell military-grade weapons on Facebook.
[12:11:25.484 --> 12:11:26.444]  What about that loophole?
[12:11:26.464 --> 12:11:31.046]  But if you say ISIS in a YouTube video, you'll be demonetized and they'll take it down.
[12:11:32.527 --> 12:11:33.427]  It's totally ridiculous.
[12:11:33.447 --> 12:11:36.508]  And let's talk about another thing with censorship, since we're on that point anyways.
[12:11:36.548 --> 12:11:37.208]  Think about this.
[12:11:38.189 --> 12:11:46.272]  When Donald Trump came out and started hammering Hillary on the Clinton Foundation, how they should give that money back to the people in Haiti.
[12:11:46.952 --> 12:11:48.633]  And she goes, oh, we did give the money.
[12:11:48.653 --> 12:11:50.774]  And he goes, trust me right now, they wouldn't take your money.
[12:11:51.154 --> 12:11:52.134]  They want no part of you.
[12:11:52.954 --> 12:11:54.095]  I tweeted out about that.
[12:11:54.915 --> 12:11:59.817]  And I had around 3 million tweet impressions at that time over the course of the debate thus far.
[12:11:59.837 --> 12:12:01.337]  It was like around 9.02 p.m.
[12:12:01.898 --> 12:12:02.758]  Central Standard Time.
[12:12:03.158 --> 12:12:09.580]  Within seconds, both of those tweets got taken down, talking about how the Hillary Clinton Foundation was screwing over Haitians.
[12:12:09.980 --> 12:12:17.223]  Now, you know, I might not be an expert on it, but I did spend a week down there with Michael Zimmerman, with Gary Haven, exposing what's going on.
[12:12:17.263 --> 12:12:18.864]  The fact that there are people still dying.
[12:12:18.884 --> 12:12:22.345]  A lot of people forgot that Hurricane Matthew literally just
[12:12:22.845 --> 12:12:25.666]  Destroyed the southern peninsula in Haiti.
[12:12:26.086 --> 12:12:30.508]  There's millions of people right now starving without food, water, without those medical supplies.
[12:12:30.828 --> 12:12:37.450]  People who had to cut their way down roads to get to a medical facility just to be seen to get first aid.
[12:12:37.930 --> 12:12:42.932]  Then we have to fly in in a plane into a grass field and medevac them out to Port-au-Prince
[12:12:43.652 --> 12:12:44.072]  We're good to go.
[12:13:03.126 --> 12:13:13.090]  And if they would have helped them initially after the earthquake and helped build the infrastructure that they needed to withstand a hurricane or an earthquake, we wouldn't have seen anything.
[12:13:13.530 --> 12:13:15.511]  But you see, the media isn't covering this.
[12:13:15.551 --> 12:13:19.772]  I mean, we're one of the only few people out there actually covering this, actually getting footage.
[12:13:20.312 --> 12:13:28.335]  And, you know, I was like really moved earlier when you talked about the fact that there was another crew that actually was out there going trying to help and crashed.
[12:13:28.395 --> 12:13:29.036]  And died, yes.
[12:13:30.256 --> 12:13:31.356]  That could have been me and Michael.
[12:13:31.676 --> 12:13:33.957]  The UN is out there helping these people.
[12:13:34.057 --> 12:13:39.778]  They're making sure that they get whatever rations they get and that riots don't happen in the street because these people are starving.
[12:13:39.818 --> 12:13:41.959]  They're not helping them, they're not saving lives.
[12:13:42.059 --> 12:13:50.621]  No, they're putting food and water in the bellies of soldiers with their little blue helmets on, driving around in convoys with their fingers on the trigger.
[12:13:50.641 --> 12:13:52.261]  I have pictures, we have a video of that.
[12:13:53.382 --> 12:14:08.703]  I saw the picture Zimmerman actually tweeted it out put it on Instagram or whatever and it was like the UN is here to help and it's like they're all sitting in their safe space with their finger literally on the trigger of a gun like who's gonna run up to them and say please help me my
[12:14:09.264 --> 12:14:17.091]  I just don't understand how anybody in their right mind could actually vote for this woman to have anything to do with the Clintons, with their foundations, with the Clinton Global Initiative.
[12:14:17.472 --> 12:14:18.533]  Go watch Clinton Cash.
[12:14:18.593 --> 12:14:19.794]  Go watch Hillary's America.
[12:14:20.074 --> 12:14:24.478]  Watch our reports on Haiti and see how corrupt, how truly evil these people are.
[12:14:24.538 --> 12:14:25.579]  Listen to Gary Haven.
[12:14:25.920 --> 12:14:26.200]  Plea.
[12:14:26.240 --> 12:14:27.521]  Listen to the people out there.
[12:14:27.842 --> 12:14:29.243]  Plea and beg for help.
[12:14:29.383 --> 12:14:29.563]  Right.
[12:14:29.683 --> 12:14:40.033]  Well, Gary Haven is actually using his own plane, his own money, to fly Rand Paul in every single year so that Rand Paul can give free eye exams, eye surgery.
[12:14:40.053 --> 12:14:45.698]  But why is he having to do that if there's so much money that this great Clinton Foundation?
[12:14:45.878 --> 12:14:52.504]  Yeah, he went to the same hospital that I went to and Jeremy, which is on the, you have the Southern Peninsula, so if you actually
[12:14:53.445 --> 12:14:54.605]  Never seen what Haiti looks like.
[12:14:54.645 --> 12:14:57.026]  Take your right hand and make a peace sign and turn it sideways.
[12:14:57.046 --> 12:14:58.747]  That's essentially what Haiti is.
[12:14:58.787 --> 12:15:02.267]  You have Port-au-Prince here in the middle, and then down here is the Southern Peninsula.
[12:15:02.668 --> 12:15:12.490]  And the middle thing right here, this part, is the actual, the whole area, the eye of the hurricane, yeah, went over and destroyed, which is Lakai, Damari, and Jeremy.
[12:15:12.750 --> 12:15:17.932]  And if you actually go there and look at some of our footage, it looks like just this dark
[12:15:18.812 --> 12:15:21.976]  Brown ground with all the trees knocked over.
[12:15:22.116 --> 12:15:23.518]  All their vegetation is gone.
[12:15:23.738 --> 12:15:25.600]  There's hardly any trees standing up.
[12:15:26.201 --> 12:15:29.344]  I mean, it is the most horrific thing I've ever seen in my life.
[12:15:29.685 --> 12:15:35.992]  And she sits here and tells us that this foundation is world class, that people should continue giving money.
[12:15:36.252 --> 12:15:36.452]  Right.
[12:15:36.512 --> 12:15:37.733]  That is a big negative.
[12:15:37.953 --> 12:15:46.078]  This lady right here, she runs an actual real organization on the ground called FARA, and they are the ones actually bringing the food in.
[12:15:46.519 --> 12:15:54.824]  Why does it take a billionaire like Gary Haven from Texas to go out there and do something when we have all these governments worth billions of dollars?
[12:15:55.504 --> 12:15:56.145]  Well, she did.
[12:15:56.565 --> 12:15:58.386]  OK, come on now.
[12:15:58.606 --> 12:16:01.588]  She did help build a five star resort on Haiti.
[12:16:01.728 --> 12:16:02.308]  And a mine?
[12:16:02.328 --> 12:16:03.369]  That helped them.
[12:16:03.489 --> 12:16:04.290]  I mean, that helped those
[12:16:04.830 --> 12:16:07.070]  You know what they did for the kids on Earth Day?
[12:16:07.270 --> 12:16:08.551]  They planted a tree.
[12:16:09.551 --> 12:16:11.491]  And I bet they named it after the thing.
[12:16:11.511 --> 12:16:13.592]  And you know what the hashtag is?
[12:16:14.212 --> 12:16:17.452]  It was eating bark or something like that.
[12:16:17.792 --> 12:16:20.713]  I was talking to some of the doctors on the ground because there was no food.
[12:16:20.733 --> 12:16:22.953]  The Clinton Foundation wasn't bringing any food to anybody.
[12:16:23.233 --> 12:16:26.634]  And all that was left at the time after the earthquake was just tree.
[12:16:26.774 --> 12:16:30.335]  And some lady joked about how, oh well they can always eat bark on the tree.
[12:16:30.355 --> 12:16:31.615]  That'll sustain them for a while.
[12:16:31.875 --> 12:16:32.135]  Wow.
[12:16:33.243 --> 12:16:38.665]  Hillary goes in and then plants this tree and it's almost like a joke to spit in the face of these people who are out there starving and dying.
[12:16:39.005 --> 12:16:40.505]  We don't have to spend too much time on this.
[12:16:40.545 --> 12:16:42.846]  I know it's depressing, but it's something that's important to me.
[12:16:42.866 --> 12:16:46.187]  Once you've been there and you've seen it, it definitely holds a special place in your heart.
[12:16:46.327 --> 12:16:51.429]  And she would dare call to it in the debate tonight as they need our help.
[12:16:51.489 --> 12:16:54.530]  And it's like, yeah, they really did need your help.
[12:16:54.590 --> 12:16:57.791]  And that's why so many millions of Americans, people around the world,
[12:16:58.291 --> 12:17:03.372]  Donated to the Clinton Foundation so that you could help Haiti, and you didn't.
[12:17:03.472 --> 12:17:09.433]  You lined your pockets with it because you're a hypocrite, you're a globalist, and you're a liar, and that's what you're going to do to our own country.
[12:17:09.733 --> 12:17:11.214]  Let's go take some more phone calls.
[12:17:13.114 --> 12:17:18.635]  All right, let's go to, let me see, I am blind as a bat, but it looks like... Patty in Texas?
[12:17:19.015 --> 12:17:19.575]  That'll work.
[12:17:19.735 --> 12:17:21.096]  Want to talk about Danny Williams?
[12:17:21.136 --> 12:17:22.336]  Hello, hello.
[12:17:22.536 --> 12:17:23.576]  Hey there, Patty, how's it going?
[12:17:23.596 --> 12:17:25.957]  Welcome to the InfoWars debate coverage.
[12:17:26.517 --> 12:17:26.817]  Good night.
[12:17:27.588 --> 12:17:28.008]  How are you?
[12:17:28.588 --> 12:17:29.409]  Fantastic.
[12:17:30.009 --> 12:17:35.271]  I just want to make three quick points, because I know there's probably a lot of people that want to talk, and I could talk for hours.
[12:17:35.452 --> 12:17:56.401]  So, on the debate, I observed, and I about had a heart attack, when Hillary started talking about Russian espionage being the release of the WikiLeaks, and they're the ones hacking this, and I said to myself, oh my God, she is setting up the Michael Savage
[12:17:57.222 --> 12:18:01.263]  Um, scenario that he gave yesterday, I believe it was, uh, on the show.
[12:18:01.723 --> 12:18:02.783]  He said, here's what they'll do.
[12:18:03.524 --> 12:18:06.804]  You know, uh, if Trump wins, they'll do a recall.
[12:18:06.824 --> 12:18:08.765]  They'll say, nope, the vote was no good.
[12:18:09.085 --> 12:18:10.505]  We have evidence the Russians hacked.
[12:18:10.645 --> 12:18:11.925]  We're not taking any questions.
[12:18:11.985 --> 12:18:12.326]  Good night.
[12:18:12.406 --> 12:18:14.506]  You know, I said, she set it up.
[12:18:14.886 --> 12:18:16.567]  She just teed it up for them.
[12:18:17.667 --> 12:18:22.528]  And I mean, I hope that's not true, but when you're looking at patterns of things,
[12:18:23.188 --> 12:18:30.611]  You're seeing it come down in the press, or not in the press as it were, and then you're watching shows that put out the truth like Infowars and Drudge and all these.
[12:18:31.391 --> 12:18:34.432]  You can see, you know, where things are kind of going.
[12:18:34.732 --> 12:18:39.194]  And that kind of really, I said, oh my god, I can't believe it's true.
[12:18:39.934 --> 12:18:41.375]  But I'm voting Trump anyway, so.
[12:18:42.330 --> 12:18:43.731]  Everyone's got to get out there and vote.
[12:18:44.291 --> 12:18:44.691]  It matters.
[12:18:45.051 --> 12:18:49.033]  Isn't it crazy how they just want to say, we've rigged elections, what does that even mean?
[12:18:49.073 --> 12:18:52.175]  But by the way, the Russians are totally going to hack our elections.
[12:18:52.755 --> 12:19:09.703]  They have to set that up just in case so many people, like the tens of thousands of people that have been at Donald Trump's rallies, if those people actually show up and vote and it's such a landslide and there's no denying it, they have to still give themselves a way out to be able to say, it can't be right.
[12:19:09.883 --> 12:19:11.224]  Putin must have helped him win.
[12:19:12.802 --> 12:19:13.843]  That's probably where they're going with it.
[12:19:14.483 --> 12:19:22.628]  It was kind of funny, though, how Wallace asked Trump if he'll accept the results after the election, but she's the one claiming conspiracy and that it's the Russians' fault.
[12:19:22.648 --> 12:19:24.869]  So I thought that Wallace kind of dropped the ball there.
[12:19:24.889 --> 12:19:28.151]  I think he should have then moved over and said, Hillary, same question goes to you.
[12:19:28.211 --> 12:19:31.213]  Are you going to accept the results once Trump wins in a landslide?
[12:19:31.233 --> 12:19:32.414]  Yeah, well, because who's going to rig it?
[12:19:32.454 --> 12:19:34.955]  I mean, the results are the results, so you should just accept it.
[12:19:34.975 --> 12:19:40.599]  I mean, I felt like her response, or the way she put that out,
[12:19:41.109 --> 12:19:43.830]  It's almost like she feels confident that it's in the bag already.
[12:19:43.850 --> 12:19:46.352]  Well, she's hoping on the Electoral College.
[12:19:48.032 --> 12:19:51.854]  I felt like she was much more aggressive this time than she was.
[12:19:51.894 --> 12:19:54.536]  I mean, Trump was on the rampage last time.
[12:19:54.976 --> 12:20:00.679]  He was a little more reserved, but she seemed to be more aggressive and more attacking this time.
[12:20:00.919 --> 12:20:02.100]  And so I'm not quite sure.
[12:20:03.294 --> 12:20:04.735]  I think she seemed a little bit more flustered.
[12:20:04.775 --> 12:20:13.759]  I think he made really good arguments, really good points, and kind of let her get flustered, so it kind of made her look a little unprofessional.
[12:20:13.839 --> 12:20:20.763]  Maybe that made her look more aggressive and butch, but that she was because she was very flustered, and she was.
[12:20:21.423 --> 12:20:24.265]  Just waiting for the WikiLeaks hat to drop.
[12:20:24.325 --> 12:20:24.825]  And it did.
[12:20:25.065 --> 12:20:26.566]  And she immediately pivoted.
[12:20:26.626 --> 12:20:27.486]  She had practiced that.
[12:20:27.526 --> 12:20:29.448]  We've got to pivot immediately to the Russians.
[12:20:29.588 --> 12:20:32.029]  Don't get into the details of what's discovered.
[12:20:32.369 --> 12:20:41.694]  Just like Marco Rubio came out today saying, you know, I'm not going to look at these WikiLeaks because, hey, if it could happen to the Democrats, it could happen to us next.
[12:20:41.795 --> 12:20:42.735]  And I'm like, great.
[12:20:43.015 --> 12:20:45.837]  If it exposes your corruption on either side, go for it.
[12:20:47.273 --> 12:20:48.714]  Alright, thanks Patty for your call.
[12:20:48.734 --> 12:20:50.235]  Now we're going to go to Gene in New York.
[12:20:50.596 --> 12:20:52.337]  You've been online for quite some time.
[12:20:52.797 --> 12:20:54.979]  What points would you like to make or what questions do you have?
[12:20:54.999 --> 12:20:57.581]  Hey, what's going on guys?
[12:20:57.661 --> 12:20:58.622]  Great show by the way.
[12:20:59.282 --> 12:21:02.885]  Listen, something funny.
[12:21:03.646 --> 12:21:06.468]  Obama was whining, you guys played a clip a couple minutes ago, right?
[12:21:06.528 --> 12:21:09.570]  He's saying, oh you gotta work through your problems, right?
[12:21:09.930 --> 12:21:10.531]  Isn't that what he said?
[12:21:10.551 --> 12:21:11.712]  To meet your goals.
[12:21:14.011 --> 12:21:17.273]  The way he doesn't deal with his problems is he doesn't have to answer to Congress.
[12:21:17.293 --> 12:21:18.113]  He just goes over them.
[12:21:18.253 --> 12:21:19.594]  Yeah, he's got his pen and his phone.
[12:21:20.575 --> 12:21:21.595]  Yeah, exactly.
[12:21:21.875 --> 12:21:26.898]  So anyway, um, the thing I'd like to bring up is the media thing.
[12:21:27.178 --> 12:21:30.220]  You know, there's such a thing as overexposure.
[12:21:30.260 --> 12:21:32.661]  And I'm beginning to see it in the town I live in.
[12:21:32.681 --> 12:21:35.743]  People are starting to say, Oh God, I can't wait till this thing's over.
[12:21:36.023 --> 12:21:36.643]  You know what I mean?
[12:21:36.663 --> 12:21:39.425]  They're pushing it so much that people are sick of it.
[12:21:41.380 --> 12:21:50.904]  Yeah well they're actually talking about that there's some sort of a diagnosis now for the election fatigue and I mean you could probably go get some pills from your doctor based on the election.
[12:21:50.924 --> 12:21:52.505]  Get you addicted to something.
[12:21:52.525 --> 12:21:55.206]  I could get my medical marijuana card based on election 2016.
[12:21:55.286 --> 12:22:04.550]  The whole thing, you know, in history has there ever been a president that went on the campaign trail as much as Obama has for Hillary?
[12:22:05.869 --> 12:22:11.971]  I mean, he doesn't spend that much time at the White House anyways, he's usually playing golf, so for him it's kind of... That's true, he does have a lot of time on his feet.
[12:22:12.051 --> 12:22:13.491]  At least he's doing something for once.
[12:22:13.631 --> 12:22:22.933]  Yeah, and also the things that they're saying on the campaign trail are completely opposite of what they said initially when they were campaigning against Hillary Clinton.
[12:22:23.534 --> 12:22:33.136]  It's just... ugh, the hypocrisy and how in the can, and that's why I want everyone to understand it's not about Hillary Clinton, it's about the House of Cards that she represents.
[12:22:34.127 --> 12:22:37.709]  Right, and the House of Cards is about to fall because I've been watching C-SPAN a lot.
[12:22:38.550 --> 12:22:43.233]  And the whole case with Comey, they're thinking it may be reopened.
[12:22:44.273 --> 12:22:46.354]  Because there's so much evidence, so much new evidence.
[12:22:46.374 --> 12:22:46.615]  It better be.
[12:22:47.875 --> 12:22:50.017]  So, I mean, that could be our October surprise.
[12:22:51.818 --> 12:22:57.061]  They're saying, you know, I've been reading online, maybe in a week or two this case seriously may be reopened.
[12:22:57.981 --> 12:23:00.163]  Well, everything that's come out with it, I mean, I wouldn't...
[12:23:01.488 --> 12:23:02.689]  There's a lot of people pissed off.
[12:23:02.729 --> 12:23:15.796]  There's a lot of people in the FBI who said that, you know what, we wanted Hillary prosecuted, we wanted something done, and it was Loretta Lynch and it was Comey who came over and stepped over the whole thing and kind of, you know, took the ball, took the lead on that one and really just screwed it over.
[12:23:15.896 --> 12:23:21.959]  With their friend and and the fact that she said she met on the plane with him and just talked about, you know, like friendly personal business.
[12:23:22.200 --> 12:23:26.142]  That right there is proof that she should have recused herself from the entire thing.
[12:23:26.542 --> 12:23:35.025]  Or we have Comey agreeing to smash the laptops of people in exchange for their testimony when the case isn't even closed yet.
[12:23:35.045 --> 12:23:36.666]  Yeah, I thought that was a friend meeting a friend.
[12:23:36.706 --> 12:23:44.808]  That was the wife of a possible or a presidential nominee and a... Rape-y, raper.
[12:23:45.709 --> 12:23:48.650]  Oh my god, it's just, it's ridiculous.
[12:23:48.690 --> 12:23:50.790]  Well anyways, thanks Jean for your call.
[12:23:50.830 --> 12:23:53.131]  Let's move on to Jenna in Indiana.
[12:23:53.491 --> 12:23:55.092]  What questions or comments do you have?
[12:23:56.118 --> 12:23:56.458]  Hi.
[12:23:56.478 --> 12:23:57.899]  Hey there, how's it going?
[12:23:58.620 --> 12:24:00.201]  It's going good.
[12:24:00.782 --> 12:24:11.171]  Being a part of the Millennial group and being able to vote this year for the first time for the president, it's a pretty big deal for me and I know for a lot of young people around.
[12:24:11.191 --> 12:24:22.380]  A big thing that I've noticed that's been trending on my page recently has been that Hillary never denied that the WikiLeaks thing was false.
[12:24:23.017 --> 12:24:36.043]  And that's a big thing that people are taking a look at on Facebook and Google and everything and I think that's a big eye-opener is that she never denied and she was basically pointing the finger directly at Russia.
[12:24:36.663 --> 12:24:47.348]  Another thing that people are bringing up to tonight is if that was a good thing for the Secretary of State to basically call out and point the finger at Putin in Russia.
[12:24:48.175 --> 12:24:54.680]  And, you know, we've been told that people are being brought back to Russia, family members, stuff like that.
[12:24:55.321 --> 12:25:01.446]  So a lot of people are concerned if that was the right move on her behalf because, you know, she basically called him out.
[12:25:01.526 --> 12:25:05.449]  I mean, Trump wants an ally out of Putin, out of Russia.
[12:25:05.469 --> 12:25:06.810]  I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[12:25:06.830 --> 12:25:09.973]  I don't think we should live the rest of our lives in fear of Russia.
[12:25:09.993 --> 12:25:14.496]  If she's Miss Open Borders, Open Trade, then we should be friends.
[12:25:14.536 --> 12:25:15.777]  No, she's made numerous statements.
[12:25:15.797 --> 12:25:17.679]  We shouldn't want to fight nuclear wars with them.
[12:25:17.779 --> 12:25:26.869]  She's made numerous statements, time and time again, her and Barack Obama, where we should embrace our enemies, we should learn to try to get along with them, and not constantly be at war.
[12:25:27.510 --> 12:25:33.156]  Michael Savage, yesterday on his radio show, actually played two of those clips where both Clinton and Obama said that.
[12:25:33.616 --> 12:25:38.558]  And here they are, they come out and like you said, the statement she made is reckless.
[12:25:38.918 --> 12:25:41.680]  And she wants World War III with these guys.
[12:25:42.040 --> 12:25:45.061]  She wants to do everything she can to blame all of this on Russia.
[12:25:45.401 --> 12:25:51.004]  Meanwhile, Trump's just going, hey, Putin said something nice about me, that's fine, but I'd rather make allies with these guys.
[12:25:51.024 --> 12:25:52.985]  I might not 100% trust them, but
[12:25:53.745 --> 12:26:09.763]  Why don't we come together, let's work together, let's destroy ISIS, let's put an end to the people who are throwing homosexuals off bridges, throwing women in cages, raping them, burning them alive, drowning them, chopping their heads off, shooting them at point-blank range, training up child soldiers to go out and carry out these mass attacks.
[12:26:09.983 --> 12:26:15.369]  We have young kids who are sitting around confused over gender identity, but these guys, guess what they're doing?
[12:26:15.489 --> 12:26:16.410]  They're training to kill!
[12:26:16.430 --> 12:26:25.419]  So there's a war going on and we can use Russia as an ally to come together, take out this ISIS group or ISIL or whatever you want to call it, defeat them.
[12:26:26.288 --> 12:26:27.689]  And let's just go on about our merry way.
[12:26:27.909 --> 12:26:35.296]  Well, and that's why that's the big problem is that Russia has gone into Syria and stepped in and say, no, we're going to take out ISIS.
[12:26:35.336 --> 12:26:37.918]  We're not going to allow you to do this because the U.S.
[12:26:37.978 --> 12:26:40.641]  and their allies, their plan is to take out Assad.
[12:26:41.041 --> 12:26:46.446]  And they're not happy with the fact that Russia is going against their plan and Russia saying, hey, now, hold up.
[12:26:46.546 --> 12:26:48.828]  And so that's why Russia is now the enemy.
[12:26:48.908 --> 12:26:52.752]  I mean, it's beyond what we can even comprehend because it's on this huge chessboard.
[12:26:53.733 --> 12:26:59.357]  But Jenna, I'm really glad to hear that you are part of the millennial generation and you are awake and aware.
[12:26:59.377 --> 12:27:07.963]  And I think it is really important for people to understand that Hillary Clinton did not deny the fact that these WikiLeaks emails were fake.
[12:27:08.423 --> 12:27:11.886]  She just automatically tries to pivot to the boogeyman.
[12:27:12.326 --> 12:27:19.292]  And that's what's key, that they continually, Donna Brazile even, they continually try to make people look away.
[12:27:19.972 --> 12:27:22.153]  Look away from the dumpster fire that's over here.
[12:27:22.173 --> 12:27:23.533]  There's nothing to see here, folks.
[12:27:24.013 --> 12:27:25.674]  Just be afraid of the Russians.
[12:27:25.994 --> 12:27:29.095]  And that's why we cannot let the WikiLeaks story die.
[12:27:29.135 --> 12:27:31.155]  We can't let the Project Veritas story die.
[12:27:31.436 --> 12:27:36.557]  This is exposing the corruption to the core that we are dealing with in this country.
[12:27:36.857 --> 12:27:42.599]  And that's why they want you to look away and be afraid of some non-existent mythological boogeyman
[12:27:42.859 --> 12:27:50.284]  Even ISIS, which our government helped to create so that they would have a boogeyman to go in and fight their proxy war.
[12:27:50.424 --> 12:27:51.665]  She's a master pivoter.
[12:27:51.705 --> 12:27:54.947]  I mean, she should definitely go for tryouts for the NBA.
[12:27:54.967 --> 12:28:01.072]  Maybe she could be on the Cleveland Cavaliers or something like that with LeBron James and they can all just cry together.
[12:28:01.092 --> 12:28:02.052]  I don't know.
[12:28:02.092 --> 12:28:02.593]  It's ridiculous.
[12:28:02.633 --> 12:28:04.074]  Well, anyways, thanks for your call, Jenna.
[12:28:04.374 --> 12:28:07.316]  Let's go to our next caller, Jared in Ohio.
[12:28:07.696 --> 12:28:11.699]  Welcome to our live coverage of the third and final presidential debate.
[12:28:13.411 --> 12:28:14.972]  Yes, thank you for having me online.
[12:28:15.913 --> 12:28:16.654]  Well, thanks for being here.
[12:28:16.694 --> 12:28:17.254]  What's your question?
[12:28:18.315 --> 12:28:24.940]  Yes, I just wanted to make the point during the debate, I'm kind of backtracking to you guys were talking about Black Lives Matter and the thugs.
[12:28:25.160 --> 12:28:29.543]  If, you know, Trump gets elected, they will probably start riots across the country.
[12:28:29.923 --> 12:28:38.129]  Well, during the middle of the debate, I'm sorry, Glenn Beck, I don't know if you've ever seen his report about five years ago when he was still with Fox News.
[12:28:38.670 --> 12:28:40.351]  He did a report on George Soros.
[12:28:40.431 --> 12:28:41.572]  It was a three day report.
[12:28:42.282 --> 12:29:02.778]  And at the beginning he has one of George Soros's pawns talking and he goes, you know, it's from the top down, bottom up, inside out, and then he goes into an explanation on what that truly means about how the government pushing down on the people while rioters are pushing up on the people and then inside out as in flipping the government inside out to where now we control the government.
[12:29:03.279 --> 12:29:05.581]  And she made the point during the debate that
[12:29:06.690 --> 12:29:08.631]  I believe it was when they were talking about taxes.
[12:29:08.731 --> 12:29:10.092]  She was talking about the middle class.
[12:29:10.452 --> 12:29:12.593]  I want to do from the middle out, from the bottom up.
[12:29:12.713 --> 12:29:14.574]  And then she said not from the top down.
[12:29:14.914 --> 12:29:22.277]  So she was like almost referring to what I guess George Soros is pushing upon his pawns that, you know, top down, bottom up, inside out.
[12:29:22.417 --> 12:29:24.458]  She basically referenced that quote.
[12:29:25.489 --> 12:29:40.482]  Well yeah, we see from her emails that that's their most important thing is to make George Soros happy because he donates so much to her campaign and to all these other groups that are helping to prop up this really progressive movement all over the world.
[12:29:40.502 --> 12:29:42.524]  Yeah, he's really good at donating to misery.
[12:29:43.035 --> 12:29:43.255]  Yeah.
[12:29:43.575 --> 12:29:54.303]  If he sees a little bit of conflict, a little civil unrest, something that's going to help take down a government, especially one that's so great, like this country, he wants to take it down because the globalists want to get it.
[12:29:54.323 --> 12:29:54.923]  He's an instigator.
[12:29:54.943 --> 12:30:03.209]  He's like that weak person who just kind of sits back at school and pins people together and gets that fight going and he just kind of steps back and does the Smithers.
[12:30:04.109 --> 12:30:04.610]  Exactly.
[12:30:04.650 --> 12:30:06.231]  And lets other people fight his fight for him.
[12:30:06.251 --> 12:30:11.755]  But that's what people just, they really got to pray for people out there that are kind of caught up in this movement because
[12:30:12.475 --> 12:30:13.875]  They're not wrong.
[12:30:13.935 --> 12:30:23.598]  They're not bad people for wanting justice, for wanting peace, for wanting to stop being beaten and targeted by police who abuse their authority and their power.
[12:30:23.638 --> 12:30:24.798]  Because yes, that is true.
[12:30:24.878 --> 12:30:25.538]  It does happen.
[12:30:26.659 --> 12:30:31.460]  So you've got to pray for them that we do find justice in this country because we should have that.
[12:30:32.260 --> 12:30:46.493]  But at the other hand, help them, show them, educate them how they are being used and weaponized to fight a fight against, you know, black versus white, rather than the real true enemy that we all need to shake off.
[12:30:46.513 --> 12:30:53.879]  I agree with that, you know, trying to open people's eyes to what the true corruption is on, you know, what side it is.
[12:30:54.499 --> 12:30:57.782]  And how do you go about trying to get through to some of these people?
[12:30:57.802 --> 12:30:59.183]  Because my parents are
[12:31:00.453 --> 12:31:11.861]  On the Democratic side and you know talking to them it's like it's almost like talking to a wall basically you know you give them facts and truths and they have an excuse of why that probably is not true almost every time.
[12:31:13.624 --> 12:31:14.164]  I hear you.
[12:31:14.184 --> 12:31:19.447]  I mean, honestly, I have learned to just step away.
[12:31:19.607 --> 12:31:21.708]  Like, some people are so far beyond.
[12:31:21.728 --> 12:31:27.250]  They're so locked in their own belief system, their own point of view.
[12:31:27.450 --> 12:31:34.073]  They're just not ready, either now or maybe even in this entire lifetime, to advance and to hear it.
[12:31:34.113 --> 12:31:34.954]  But that's okay.
[12:31:35.034 --> 12:31:35.814]  That's okay for them.
[12:31:35.834 --> 12:31:36.754]  They're on their own path.
[12:31:36.794 --> 12:31:37.675]  They're doing their own thing.
[12:31:38.195 --> 12:31:46.018]  But if enough people evolve and get it and change their perception and understand the truth and hear the truth, that's what we need.
[12:31:46.038 --> 12:31:51.800]  A very small percentage of people is what is needed to shift the consciousness of this world.
[12:31:51.860 --> 12:31:54.401]  So don't bang your head up against a brick wall.
[12:31:54.421 --> 12:31:57.962]  Like if some people are just not ready, that's okay.
[12:31:58.062 --> 12:31:59.442]  That's just where they're at in this life.
[12:32:00.162 --> 12:32:02.483]  And be loving.
[12:32:02.703 --> 12:32:03.704]  Send them love.
[12:32:03.844 --> 12:32:04.844]  Don't be frustrated.
[12:32:05.484 --> 12:32:07.505]  Share your message with people who are ready to hear it.
[12:32:08.908 --> 12:32:15.594]  But it is always good to have someone on the opposite side, you know, pointing out different things that you might have not noticed about the candidate you might be voting for.
[12:32:15.614 --> 12:32:21.038]  Yeah, because nobody's, I mean, seriously, none of the candidates are a savior.
[12:32:21.058 --> 12:32:22.599]  Perfect.
[12:32:22.699 --> 12:32:24.041]  All right, good points, Jared.
[12:32:24.061 --> 12:32:25.462]  Let's go to Jersey Mike.
[12:32:25.882 --> 12:32:27.363]  Mike in New Jersey, what do you want to say?
[12:32:27.383 --> 12:32:33.889]  Hey, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, you did outstanding coverage tonight.
[12:32:34.089 --> 12:32:37.512]  We shall be praying that Donald Trump wins this election.
[12:32:38.767 --> 12:32:46.770]  I've given faithful and honorable service to this nation under six different presidents, and I'm going to tell you what's going to happen, regardless of who wins.
[12:32:48.311 --> 12:32:51.032]  I'm happy to hear that the UN was brought up.
[12:32:51.492 --> 12:33:07.698]  I actually met Alex years ago during Operation Urban Warrior, and in that time frame during the Clinton administration, we had a unit of the Ukrainian Naval Infantry
[12:33:08.326 --> 12:33:18.270]  At Camp Lejeune, training with several Marine Corps units, one exercise was done at their mount facility, their military operations in the urban terrain facility out there.
[12:33:19.891 --> 12:33:24.373]  Our job was to play the op for opposing force.
[12:33:24.453 --> 12:33:27.474]  We were the townspeople.
[12:33:28.203 --> 12:33:32.785]  And it was the responsibility of the Ukrainian Naval Infantry to patrol a U.S.
[12:33:32.865 --> 12:33:33.866]  town and U.S.
[12:33:33.906 --> 12:33:34.326]  citizens.
[12:33:34.806 --> 12:33:41.169]  In the same time frame prior to that, we had Joint Task Force 160 out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
[12:33:41.529 --> 12:33:44.171]  During that, we had something called Operation Sea Signal.
[12:33:44.871 --> 12:33:51.074]  During Operation Sea Signal, that's when the original camp, X-Ray and Camp Delta, were opened up.
[12:33:51.414 --> 12:33:55.636]  We had a massive flood of Cubans
[12:33:56.901 --> 12:33:58.382]  And Haitian nationals.
[12:33:59.402 --> 12:34:13.267]  Now, the interesting point of this is that during all of these operations, the World Health Organization was involved, the United Nations was involved, and all U.S.
[12:34:13.327 --> 12:34:18.149]  forces were placed under the command of the United Nations and has continued that way.
[12:34:18.749 --> 12:34:23.031]  So, irregardless of who becomes the president,
[12:34:24.076 --> 12:34:27.338]  The titular head of the United States is what it's going to amount to.
[12:34:27.698 --> 12:34:39.945]  My fear is that if Donald Trump wins, they're going to show him the Zapruder film, tell him to pay close attention to what happened to the last man who tried to be a president.
[12:34:40.645 --> 12:34:43.207]  And that has me very, very, very concerned.
[12:34:43.806 --> 12:34:45.947]  Mike, I gotta say, I agree with you.
[12:34:46.268 --> 12:34:55.213]  I have really tried to kind of hold back saying what I think is going to happen because I don't like speaking things into existence, but I am afraid.
[12:34:55.333 --> 12:34:57.394]  I do feel the same way.
[12:34:57.434 --> 12:35:06.580]  That's why Hillary Clinton and all of these agencies and networks have rallied around getting her elected because they've got to complete their globalist
[12:35:07.080 --> 12:35:10.025]  Well, Trump's already called out the UN.
[12:35:20.793 --> 12:35:31.118]  Yeah, well exactly, but that's what he's saying is like, if we get someone in there, especially someone with such a beautiful family like Donald Trump, Ivanka with her new babies and everything.
[12:35:31.158 --> 12:35:36.140]  I mean, you get someone in there like that, that's got a lot to lose, who clearly cares about his family.
[12:35:36.220 --> 12:35:38.401]  I mean, I understand his family has agreed to this.
[12:35:38.441 --> 12:35:41.143]  They know what's at stake and they're willing to take that chance.
[12:35:41.863 --> 12:35:51.707]  But when push comes to shove, I just don't think with everything we see, all of these networks that are propping her up, I just, I agree.
[12:35:51.987 --> 12:35:53.547]  What happens after this election?
[12:35:54.248 --> 12:35:58.569]  Yeah, it's going to be an interesting time to be alive.
[12:35:58.629 --> 12:36:04.392]  And one of my favorite quotes is, the greatest duty of any patriot is to guard this country against its own government.
[12:36:04.732 --> 12:36:08.793]  And that is truly where we are, where we are arriving at.
[12:36:08.873 --> 12:36:10.574]  And I pray to God that we can
[12:36:11.357 --> 12:36:16.119]  Rely on the ballot box and not have to resort to the cartridge box.
[12:36:16.139 --> 12:36:18.059]  All right, good points, Mike.
[12:36:18.079 --> 12:36:20.840]  Let's move on to Joelle in Arizona.
[12:36:21.500 --> 12:36:22.441]  Hopefully I didn't butch your name.
[12:36:22.501 --> 12:36:23.361]  I'm blind as a bat.
[12:36:23.421 --> 12:36:24.661]  So, Joelle.
[12:36:25.882 --> 12:36:27.102]  Hi, it's Joelle.
[12:36:27.803 --> 12:36:28.963]  That's an A. Thank you, Joelle.
[12:36:28.983 --> 12:36:29.863]  Yeah, I can't see that far.
[12:36:29.903 --> 12:36:31.964]  Thank you for having me on.
[12:36:32.664 --> 12:36:34.785]  I just want to say that I'm a millennial.
[12:36:34.825 --> 12:36:37.146]  I guess I'm on the older side, but I'm only 29 years old.
[12:36:38.755 --> 12:36:43.859]  And this is like the craziest buyout that I've ever seen go on in my lifetime.
[12:36:44.659 --> 12:36:47.761]  I think a lot of that has to do with pop culture.
[12:36:47.781 --> 12:37:03.212]  I think that our parents, and I grew up trusting the media, and it's really hard for people to wrap their head around the fact that they've let this go on, that they've kind of created the situation.
[12:37:03.232 --> 12:37:04.453]  And my generation, you know,
[12:37:06.914 --> 12:37:11.656]  I think, like, conservative side was kind of woken up with 9-11.
[12:37:12.096 --> 12:37:19.940]  We were, you know, we thought we were doing the right thing going to war, and we see the devastation it's caused for nothing.
[12:37:20.280 --> 12:37:21.320]  Absolutely nothing.
[12:37:22.020 --> 12:37:28.303]  And now it's so crazy to see the Democratic nominee being so pro-war.
[12:37:28.323 --> 12:37:34.206]  I mean, she's for Monsanto, she's for GMOs, she's for all the stuff that they used to
[12:37:36.105 --> 12:37:41.631]  And that's what's craziest to me is no one even realizes the paradigm shift anymore.
[12:37:41.651 --> 12:37:48.759]  They just are so for their football team and I want this person to win and they're not even focusing on the issues.
[12:37:48.819 --> 12:37:55.106]  And it's because my generation is about memes, quick info, you know, they don't look into the other side.
[12:37:55.146 --> 12:37:57.809]  That's one thing that I noticed is really liberal people.
[12:37:58.345 --> 12:38:01.166]  They never know the opposition's argument.
[12:38:01.346 --> 12:38:03.126]  And it's like, how can you make a decision?
[12:38:03.807 --> 12:38:06.187]  Before social media, people actually had to do research.
[12:38:06.567 --> 12:38:09.608]  Now we all have handheld propaganda devices.
[12:38:09.628 --> 12:38:15.290]  Millennials, you know, the younger generation is so glued to their phone every second.
[12:38:15.730 --> 12:38:19.831]  And if you can control the media, you can control what Facebook does, like Clinton does.
[12:38:20.131 --> 12:38:22.833]  But Twitter, they can manipulate your thought.
[12:38:22.873 --> 12:38:26.075]  They control the trends, and that's what you're going to see every day.
[12:38:26.095 --> 12:38:28.057]  And these kids sit here all day looking at their phone.
[12:38:28.417 --> 12:38:30.539]  I mean, you go to a restaurant and no one's making eye contact.
[12:38:30.559 --> 12:38:31.279]  They're looking at their phone.
[12:38:31.299 --> 12:38:31.619]  Think about it.
[12:38:31.639 --> 12:38:47.491]  Facebook, Twitter, and all these social networks that have all these people on them sharing this information, they have figured out a way to curate the news and to fix the algorithm so that the only information that you're getting every day into your feed is what they want you to see.
[12:38:47.551 --> 12:38:53.816]  Trump's a racist, Trump's a pig, Trump gropes women, Trump is bad, Trump hates Mexicans, Trump hates black people, Trump hates freedom.
[12:38:53.856 --> 12:39:03.103]  All those weaponized words so that it puts people into a stupor because nobody wants to be called any of those weaponized words.
[12:39:03.183 --> 12:39:04.684]  It's worse than being a mass murderer.
[12:39:04.744 --> 12:39:07.125]  And she made a good point that no one does the research anymore.
[12:39:07.145 --> 12:39:07.446]  Right.
[12:39:07.886 --> 12:39:08.766]  Everyone just sits there.
[12:39:08.887 --> 12:39:09.887]  So that's the thing.
[12:39:10.207 --> 12:39:13.950]  We have a generation of people who just take social media for what it is.
[12:39:13.970 --> 12:39:18.592]  They share posts without actually researching and finding out whether or not that post or that meme is true.
[12:39:18.993 --> 12:39:22.435]  But if it looks good and it's catchy and it fits your narrative that you've been shaped to believe,
[12:39:22.995 --> 12:39:23.876]  Well, you hit that share button.
[12:39:23.916 --> 12:39:27.978]  You like it and it continues and that story continues to move on and on and on and on and on.
[12:39:28.318 --> 12:39:33.041]  Well, I've got to say I truly believe that there is a major shift happening.
[12:39:33.562 --> 12:39:38.445]  I think a lot of people in the millennial generation, whether you're on the young or the older spectrum of it,
[12:39:39.185 --> 12:39:46.268]  They have all kind of been dealing with this, but there's a right behind them that the kids that are coming up are saying, you know what?
[12:39:46.508 --> 12:39:47.708]  I don't want to use my phone.
[12:39:47.748 --> 12:39:48.668]  It makes me sad.
[12:39:48.728 --> 12:39:52.070]  It makes me I feel inadequate and they're putting their phones down.
[12:39:52.390 --> 12:39:54.711]  So we're really starting to see this entire shift.
[12:39:55.051 --> 12:40:01.773]  So we might have kind of a lost generation out there, but we can't lose hope because humanity always wins.
[12:40:01.813 --> 12:40:07.035]  There's always something bad and devastating going on, but humanity does always win and rebound.
[12:40:07.475 --> 12:40:14.038]  But people like you, JL, who are awake and who do get it, you gotta just fight in the present now for the good side.
[12:40:14.118 --> 12:40:15.079]  Fight for humanity.
[12:40:18.841 --> 12:40:19.641]  JL, you still there?
[12:40:20.601 --> 12:40:21.222]  Yes, yes.
[12:40:21.502 --> 12:40:22.162]  Any final thoughts?
[12:40:22.242 --> 12:40:29.926]  The other thing is I come from kind of a unique background in aviation, and I'm worse than my defense.
[12:40:30.932 --> 12:40:39.039]  And the thing that you see, well, one, the millennial generation, a lot of them have moved away from skills and are like employees now.
[12:40:39.099 --> 12:40:47.125]  And that's where you see the shift to socialism being acceptable because they don't know what it's like to earn things anymore.
[12:40:47.305 --> 12:40:52.229]  And by going back to defense, running my family's company in defense,
[12:40:52.975 --> 12:40:56.019]  You see what it is to run a small business.
[12:40:56.119 --> 12:41:02.266]  You see that people in the millennial generation group small business end with corporations and that isn't the same thing.
[12:41:03.937 --> 12:41:19.223]  Um, but on the defense side, you see what it takes to be in the big boys club and they don't want little companies like us being in their big boys club because we have morals and they don't want it to come down to, well, they won't make it because they're against this war.
[12:41:19.263 --> 12:41:33.068]  And that's what you see to get in with like Boeing, et cetera, or like a kind of cutting edge, um, company where we do, you know, breaking things for like guns, um, weapons platforms, stuff like that.
[12:41:34.045 --> 12:41:39.167]  To, we have cutting edge things that they want, but they don't want to get it from us.
[12:41:39.308 --> 12:41:48.132]  So you have to go and join these other subcompanies to get your foot in the door so they can override you if some reason why you want to withdraw.
[12:41:48.432 --> 12:41:51.593]  And that is what's happening in our country right now.
[12:41:51.934 --> 12:41:57.956]  If they feel ideas, they, um, and they make it to where you can't put your foot down.
[12:41:58.297 --> 12:42:00.978]  You can't, Americans can't stop this.
[12:42:01.664 --> 12:42:02.104]  Anymore.
[12:42:02.945 --> 12:42:13.512]  I feel like, you know, I would like a peaceful revolution, but I don't think, as a 29-year-old girl growing up right now, I don't really think it's possible anymore.
[12:42:13.632 --> 12:42:14.392]  And it's scary.
[12:42:14.513 --> 12:42:15.373]  It's really scary.
[12:42:15.453 --> 12:42:22.338]  I don't think people really realize what that means, especially when I'm making the parts that go out into war.
[12:42:22.498 --> 12:42:24.659]  I know what the fuck I'm up against, you know?
[12:42:24.879 --> 12:42:28.482]  Sorry for the language, but I know the weaponry that I'm making
[12:42:29.133 --> 12:42:31.855]  That could potentially be used against our soldiers.
[12:42:32.396 --> 12:42:32.776]  Or us.
[12:42:33.497 --> 12:42:34.097]  And that.
[12:42:34.938 --> 12:42:35.298]  Really.
[12:42:35.318 --> 12:42:36.039]  Wow.
[12:42:36.239 --> 12:42:37.060]  It's mind-blowing.
[12:42:37.280 --> 12:42:37.600]  You know?
[12:42:38.020 --> 12:42:41.603]  So, anyways, that's... JL, thank you so much for your commentary.
[12:42:41.623 --> 12:42:55.335]  You guys, I want you to get her phone number so we can talk to her after this debate coverage because you make excellent points and that's what people don't understand with these trade agreements that are happening.
[12:42:55.675 --> 12:42:57.777]  It's these huge corporations that are coming in
[12:42:58.257 --> 12:43:12.784]  Making the deals, they're deciding who gets to play the game, who gets to be involved, and they want to cut out all of those smaller companies, all of the people like JL's family who's built up, maybe they build a specific product or whatever.
[12:43:13.784 --> 12:43:14.324]  You're gone.
[12:43:14.504 --> 12:43:22.008]  If you want to say, no, I refuse to build whatever you're asking me to, or I refuse to do this or that, it doesn't meet the certain regulations.
[12:43:22.888 --> 12:43:23.408]  They're out.
[12:43:23.628 --> 12:43:29.451]  You don't have a right to refuse to do business with these new agreements that are coming down the line.
[12:43:29.852 --> 12:43:31.232]  And that's why this is so dangerous.
[12:43:31.272 --> 12:43:39.457]  Whereas Hillary Clinton is saying, you know, well, we want to create jobs and we want to make sure all the families out there here in America are going to be able to participate in this economy.
[12:43:40.017 --> 12:43:40.897]  B.S.
[12:43:41.358 --> 12:43:45.720]  We already know that she's been sitting at that table with those 600 plus corporate
[12:43:47.009 --> 12:43:49.791]  Representatives helping to draft the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[12:43:49.811 --> 12:44:00.218]  They're going to tear down companies because they don't want people like JL, who actually have a heart, have a conscience, to say, no, I disagree with what it is that you want me to do.
[12:44:00.238 --> 12:44:03.620]  This is so disheartening.
[12:44:03.640 --> 12:44:05.642]  All right, well, thanks for the call, JL.
[12:44:05.682 --> 12:44:07.363]  Let's go ahead and move to Josh.
[12:44:07.803 --> 12:44:10.665]  Josh in Virginia wants to talk about the Hillary Clinton Mao outfit.
[12:44:12.987 --> 12:44:13.587]  Which one?
[12:44:13.607 --> 12:44:14.488]  Josh, are you there?
[12:44:16.457 --> 12:44:17.498]  Oh, we lost him.
[12:44:17.578 --> 12:44:20.399]  Aw, man, Josh, you just would have waited like two more seconds, you would have been there.
[12:44:20.439 --> 12:44:22.601]  Josh, we could have talked about the Mar-a-Lago.
[12:44:22.681 --> 12:44:23.761]  All right, Cinnamon.
[12:44:23.861 --> 12:44:24.722]  Cinnamon in Kentucky.
[12:44:24.742 --> 12:44:27.143]  Hello.
[12:44:27.604 --> 12:44:28.764]  Hey there, how's it going, Cinnamon?
[12:44:29.445 --> 12:44:30.425]  It's going good.
[12:44:30.445 --> 12:44:34.167]  I want to thank you all for having me on.
[12:44:34.488 --> 12:44:40.931]  I've just been listening or watching Alex Jones for about the last year.
[12:44:41.351 --> 12:44:42.832]  I've come around.
[12:44:42.892 --> 12:44:45.514]  It's took many years to come around, but I've finally come around.
[12:44:46.141 --> 12:44:49.902]  But I was a victim of NAFTA 20 years ago.
[12:44:49.922 --> 12:45:01.124]  When that came through and was implemented, RCA went to Juarez, Mexico, and so many factories have left.
[12:45:02.244 --> 12:45:07.385]  Right, they've got to do business elsewhere.
[12:45:07.886 --> 12:45:14.427]  Yeah, if Trump can drive it home, that he can bring industry back, I think
[12:45:15.103 --> 12:45:19.069]  That will really help him and things like that.
[12:45:19.109 --> 12:45:31.187]  But I want to know your guys opinion on do you think he can repeal NAFTA and do you think he can get the new trade deals that would bring back industry and things like that.
[12:45:32.520 --> 12:45:39.067]  Well, I mean, he's definitely going to be fighting against a giant machine, but he knows what he's up against.
[12:45:39.127 --> 12:45:45.734]  I mean, he has been dealing with the government, playing politics for decades because he is a very successful businessman.
[12:45:47.036 --> 12:45:48.557]  Walker was actually telling me about a
[12:45:49.418 --> 12:45:49.679]  I think so.
[12:46:06.542 --> 12:46:07.202]  We're good to go.
[12:46:27.878 --> 12:46:34.804]  Hillary Clinton has 30 years of a complete and total failed political job.
[12:46:35.464 --> 12:46:39.408]  But Donald Trump is someone who's been successful for most of his life.
[12:46:40.469 --> 12:46:45.533]  And it's funny when people bring up the fact, well, he got a million dollar loan from his father.
[12:46:46.954 --> 12:46:50.698]  How many of us could take a million dollars and turn that into ten, eleven billions of dollars?
[12:46:51.079 --> 12:46:51.499]  Not many.
[12:46:51.519 --> 12:47:00.249]  A lot of people go out and buy some nice little car, or a cool little trendy apartment, and some new clothes, the next thing you know you're broke, and you're getting a payday loan from Montel Williams.
[12:47:01.291 --> 12:47:04.552]  But what happened is... Secondly, a million dollars is not a lot of money.
[12:47:04.812 --> 12:47:07.633]  And then after that, people always want to go, well, he went bankrupt.
[12:47:08.153 --> 12:47:09.474]  Well, look what happened in New Jersey.
[12:47:09.794 --> 12:47:10.954]  Well, you know what my mom told me?
[12:47:11.135 --> 12:47:12.535]  When I fall off the horse, you know what you do?
[12:47:12.555 --> 12:47:14.176]  You get back on and you keep trying again.
[12:47:14.476 --> 12:47:17.497]  Trump's not someone who failed ever and then just gave up.
[12:47:18.217 --> 12:47:19.678]  Because guess what happens in life?
[12:47:19.738 --> 12:47:20.458]  You fail.
[12:47:20.799 --> 12:47:22.299]  Everyone fails in life.
[12:47:22.399 --> 12:47:23.640]  That's just part of life.
[12:47:24.201 --> 12:47:26.582]  But it's how you react after you fail.
[12:47:26.882 --> 12:47:28.203]  You correct those mistakes.
[12:47:28.283 --> 12:47:30.424]  You move forward and learn from them.
[12:47:30.664 --> 12:47:33.126]  And are you successful after that?
[12:47:33.306 --> 12:47:36.688]  And I think it's shown in his track record that he's made some mistakes.
[12:47:37.188 --> 12:47:41.093]  But then he's become successful or more successful and learned and grown.
[12:47:41.333 --> 12:47:42.995]  And that's what we are supposed to do.
[12:47:43.276 --> 12:47:53.688]  And I'd rather have someone who's failed and then become successful after that than someone who spent their entire life of complete and total miserable crook, failure, hatch, hack.
[12:47:55.149 --> 12:47:58.631]  I mean, what has Hillary Clinton done that she's failed at?
[12:47:59.071 --> 12:48:00.131]  Libya, fail!
[12:48:01.072 --> 12:48:01.992]  Libya's not doing okay.
[12:48:02.012 --> 12:48:04.253]  She succeeded at covering up for her husband's rape.
[12:48:04.893 --> 12:48:07.754]  She succeeded at demonizing women and bullying them.
[12:48:08.014 --> 12:48:14.236]  Until now, until 2016, when InfoWars has taken over the thought waves.
[12:48:14.737 --> 12:48:15.977]  She was pretty successful there.
[12:48:16.017 --> 12:48:17.618]  But yeah, you make a perfect point.
[12:48:17.978 --> 12:48:22.500]  It's like, she's gone in, she's made mistakes, sure, but she hasn't corrected any of those mistakes.
[12:48:22.560 --> 12:48:23.540]  It's still a total failure.
[12:48:24.120 --> 12:48:26.022]  If anybody's going to turn it around, it's going to be him.
[12:48:26.582 --> 12:48:30.285]  And you made a point earlier, Cinnamon, that he's going to have to drag us.
[12:48:30.766 --> 12:48:31.726]  I disagree with you there.
[12:48:31.826 --> 12:48:39.973]  He doesn't have to drag us because once he becomes president, we are all going to get up on our feet and we're going to sprint to the finish line and we're going to rebuild America and get it back to the way it should be.
[12:48:40.313 --> 12:48:41.774]  So I want to thank you, Cinnamon, for your call.
[12:48:41.854 --> 12:48:43.635]  Great points, great questions.
[12:48:43.655 --> 12:48:44.736]  It was awesome to talk to you.
[12:48:44.997 --> 12:48:46.858]  Let's go to Adam in Toronto, Canada.
[12:48:47.278 --> 12:48:49.120]  Adam, what do you have to say to us?
[12:48:50.299 --> 12:48:50.699]  Hey guys.
[12:48:51.299 --> 12:48:52.300]  Hey there, how's it going?
[12:48:52.820 --> 12:48:53.540]  Oh, pretty good, man.
[12:48:53.761 --> 12:48:57.983]  I got to tell you, this election thing is probably one of the craziest things I've ever witnessed from here.
[12:48:59.063 --> 12:49:03.925]  So anyways, thanks for representing the truth because it's hard to find nowadays.
[12:49:04.485 --> 12:49:06.767]  I just kind of wanted to touch on something that she said.
[12:49:07.727 --> 12:49:10.828]  She's clearly warmongering for war with Russia.
[12:49:10.848 --> 12:49:11.849]  There's no doubt about that.
[12:49:11.909 --> 12:49:17.111]  And she's going on saying, you know, 16 agencies have all agreed that it's Russia.
[12:49:17.271 --> 12:49:18.212]  My question would be,
[12:49:19.012 --> 12:49:20.333]  Where is the proof?
[12:49:20.874 --> 12:49:25.577]  I mean, I'm getting kind of deja vu here from Bush saying that weapons of mass destruction.
[12:49:25.657 --> 12:49:26.518]  Where's the proof?
[12:49:26.718 --> 12:49:29.120]  Well, if you want to find out the truth, you have to go to hillaryclinton.com.
[12:49:29.360 --> 12:49:33.643]  Yeah, we actually just did a report on this the other night.
[12:49:33.683 --> 12:49:44.711]  I believe Margaret and I were covering this where they actually, they were investigating the hack into the DNC, but then they stopped their investigation.
[12:49:45.032 --> 12:49:47.433]  And so then this new, this latest hack,
[12:49:48.294 --> 12:49:52.017]  They don't know who did it because they had stopped investigating the hack at this point.
[12:49:52.037 --> 12:49:57.142]  So for her to say that 17 agencies have, like, case closed, decided that the Russians... It's total crap.
[12:49:57.182 --> 12:50:04.729]  Maybe it's the shadow government of the 7th floor group that decided it was the... It was the 7th floor shadow government that figured out it was the Russians who did it.
[12:50:05.369 --> 12:50:07.171]  Owen Schroer, do you want to say anything?
[12:50:08.186 --> 12:50:12.308]  Yeah, Joe, actually, I had a question for you, given your military experience.
[12:50:12.348 --> 12:50:27.735]  We talked about this earlier, you know, what Hillary Clinton knows about the nuclear launch codes, but do you think, did she perhaps commit treason when she gave out details about the nuclear response and the nuclear launching?
[12:50:28.095 --> 12:50:29.336]  It takes four days.
[12:50:29.356 --> 12:50:31.196]  Four days or four minutes or whatever she said.
[12:50:31.216 --> 12:50:37.739]  I mean, she basically gave classified, detailed information on the nuclear launching procedure.
[12:50:37.819 --> 12:50:41.041]  Could that be another instance of Hillary committing treason right there?
[12:50:41.621 --> 12:50:42.802]  That is a good possibility.
[12:50:42.842 --> 12:50:45.083]  I mean, we... She just gave out the new nuclear codes.
[12:50:45.563 --> 12:50:52.226]  I mean, she obviously is not someone who, when shaken up a bit, holds that information to herself.
[12:50:52.486 --> 12:50:53.986]  And that's someone you don't want controlling.
[12:50:55.999 --> 12:50:57.482]  Allowed people to hack into it.
[12:50:57.502 --> 12:50:58.784]  That's a good point, Joc.
[12:50:58.884 --> 12:51:00.607]  I mean, uh, Owen, that's a really good point.
[12:51:00.627 --> 12:51:01.389]  That's something I didn't think about.
[12:51:01.409 --> 12:51:02.170]  I didn't catch that earlier.
[12:51:02.190 --> 12:51:05.316]  Yeah, I mean, it was crazy that she even... You need to put that out right now.
[12:51:05.356 --> 12:51:06.718]  ...that she even brought that up.
[12:51:07.699 --> 12:51:11.101]  And then it's like, you know, you think, oh, okay, well, why does she know so much about the nuclear codes?
[12:51:11.141 --> 12:51:14.022]  Okay, well, she was fifth in command when she was Secretary of State.
[12:51:14.382 --> 12:51:21.966]  Alright, we understand why you might know about the procedure, but then to go on the debate and say, well, this is how much time it takes and this is our procedure.
[12:51:22.386 --> 12:51:28.069]  Oh, I'm sure Russia was sitting there just like with her open email server like, ooh, thanks, Hillary.
[12:51:28.129 --> 12:51:30.230]  Well, she didn't say that.
[12:51:30.290 --> 12:51:33.851]  Someone hacked her robot and that was actually the Russian speaking through her.
[12:51:33.911 --> 12:51:34.992]  She's already proven.
[12:51:36.053 --> 12:51:43.879]  Yeah, last question I would ask is from our side, you know, we're watching all this crazy stuff go on, but in the states over there, are people not demanding proof
[12:51:59.614 --> 12:52:05.978]  Because before you go to war again, I mean, if you're accusing a country of doing something as serious as that, you better have something to back it up, right?
[12:52:06.618 --> 12:52:07.679]  Very good question.
[12:52:07.799 --> 12:52:08.779]  And exactly.
[12:52:08.859 --> 12:52:11.801]  It's like, is it worth going to war with Russia?
[12:52:11.821 --> 12:52:18.045]  All I know is a lot of these emails are just getting more and more damning and damning.
[12:52:18.085 --> 12:52:21.987]  Eventually it's going to get to a point where that last dump's about to come out and they're just going to go, oop!
[12:52:23.924 --> 12:52:25.225]  I hope so.
[12:52:25.465 --> 12:52:31.250]  I was pretty sure they were going to take us to war before the election is finalized because of the fact that Hillary is tanking so bad.
[12:52:31.611 --> 12:52:36.014]  And it's not just Hillary that's going to get taken down with all this information that's coming out.
[12:52:36.094 --> 12:52:37.916]  It's the entire freaking system.
[12:52:37.976 --> 12:52:41.639]  So they might need to push that nuclear button sooner than later.
[12:52:41.659 --> 12:52:43.201]  Obama might push it.
[12:52:45.356 --> 12:52:47.017]  Alright, well thank you for your call, Adam.
[12:52:47.677 --> 12:52:52.200]  Let's go ahead and talk about some of the specials we have because, you know what, we pay the bills this way.

[12:53:17.554 --> 12:53:19.955]  It's something that works very well.
[12:53:20.055 --> 12:53:23.636]  I know Rob Dube uses it, you use it, I've used it quite a bit.
[12:53:23.656 --> 12:53:31.118]  I've used it for this 13 hour broadcast and the reason why I like it is because it gives me tons of energy but I don't crash the way I do with coffee.
[12:53:31.118 --> 12:53:33.839]  And then also we have the brand new shirt.
[12:53:33.879 --> 12:53:35.480]  Trump is my president.
[12:53:35.820 --> 12:53:37.301]  That's at the Infowars store.
[12:53:37.341 --> 12:53:39.162]  Now don't go wear it when you go vote.
[12:53:39.182 --> 12:53:41.663]  You can wear it when you go vote, but they might make you turn it inside out.
[12:53:41.723 --> 12:53:43.204]  Yeah, just put it in your car.
[12:53:43.604 --> 12:53:44.724]  Let's just save ourselves.
[12:53:44.784 --> 12:53:46.105]  We want you to go out there and vote.
[12:53:46.345 --> 12:53:47.566]  But after you get done voting,
[12:53:48.146 --> 12:53:55.149]  Tear off that little badge and put on your Trump is my president and then run around and celebrate because Trump is going to win by a landslide.
[12:53:55.510 --> 12:53:56.390]  I guarantee you.
[12:53:56.690 --> 12:54:00.932]  And then also we have the Hillary for prison t-shirts, which are my favorite.
[12:54:00.952 --> 12:54:04.154]  That is the greatest t-shirt ever made, in my opinion.
[12:54:04.234 --> 12:54:08.616]  And I love going out to these debates, these events and watching people wearing them.
[12:54:08.816 --> 12:54:13.398]  And you always see someone in the middle of the mix, in a debate, having a great discussion.
[12:54:13.618 --> 12:54:16.360]  And it's always a person wearing that exact same t-shirt right there.
[12:54:17.342 --> 12:54:25.748]  And having this t-shirt is going to be a collector's item because it is proof that you were awake in 2016.
[12:54:25.988 --> 12:54:26.889]  You knew it was up.
[12:54:27.049 --> 12:54:31.752]  You knew that Hillary needed to go to prison because we're not making these shirts after the election.
[12:54:31.812 --> 12:54:32.252]  It's done.
[12:54:32.493 --> 12:54:32.953]  This is it.
[12:54:33.033 --> 12:54:34.774]  So you better have gotten this run.
[12:54:35.154 --> 12:54:39.617]  And this is going to be your proof from here on out that you were on the right side of history.
[12:54:39.638 --> 12:54:40.298]  All right.
[12:54:40.378 --> 12:54:41.359]  We're going to go back to Owen.
[12:54:41.379 --> 12:54:44.041]  He's in the room in there in front of the Washington picture.
[12:54:44.081 --> 12:54:44.461]  What do you have?
[12:54:45.080 --> 12:54:59.448]  Well, we have people on social media and YouTube going crazy right now and working on compiling footage of what they believe is Hillary Clinton going to her earpiece and then reading off of a teleprompter on her podium.
[12:54:59.488 --> 12:55:02.990]  We had conspiracy theories about this before, but people are on YouTube
[12:55:03.470 --> 12:55:05.871]  Putting out some pretty, you know, scathing video evidence.
[12:55:05.951 --> 12:55:08.532]  Obviously, we can let the info warriors out there be the judge.
[12:55:08.892 --> 12:55:10.352]  We can investigate this for ourselves.
[12:55:10.392 --> 12:55:13.273]  But was Hillary taking answers from an earpiece?
[12:55:13.293 --> 12:55:14.113]  Did she have a podium?
[12:55:14.513 --> 12:55:15.034]  We'll find out.
[12:55:15.074 --> 12:55:23.216]  But I think we have to give credit to Malik Obama, the tweeter of the night, destroying Hillary and Barack Obama all night long.
[12:55:23.496 --> 12:55:30.058]  And then probably my favorite tweet of the night, Malik Obama saying, I wish Barack Obama was the man that Donald Trump is.
[12:55:30.318 --> 12:55:31.659]  Drop the mic with that one, Malik.
[12:55:33.151 --> 12:55:39.416]  Well, if you do catch any of that earpiece trickery, make a video, send us a link, and then we'll possibly play it on here.
[12:55:39.736 --> 12:55:43.680]  It'll give us something to look at and something to talk about.
[12:55:44.080 --> 12:56:02.195]  Also, don't forget, while you were watching the debate, whether you were watching our coverage and Alex Jones, or you were watching the actual C-SPAN feed, all of the reporters back there were taking notes, watching the C-SPAN feed, and afterwards we went out and made some videos really breaking down all these statements made by both
[12:56:02.415 --> 12:56:02.956]  We're good to go.
[12:56:24.099 --> 12:56:27.462]  I mean, like Joe said, they already tried to take down his tweets on Haiti.
[12:56:28.103 --> 12:56:29.684]  They try to suppress this information.
[12:56:29.724 --> 12:56:31.285]  They try to suppress our view count.
[12:56:31.305 --> 12:56:34.488]  They try to suppress how many people can like our videos.
[12:56:34.528 --> 12:56:35.929]  The metrics are all off.
[12:56:36.250 --> 12:56:41.915]  So, at the end of the day, there's a reason why Hillary Clinton called out Alex Jones by name during her speech.
[12:56:41.995 --> 12:56:45.338]  It's because we're freaking dominating in the info war.
[12:56:45.458 --> 12:56:48.621]  She knows they are losing, and that's all thanks to you guys.
[12:56:48.701 --> 12:56:49.962]  And then she made another video.
[12:56:50.382 --> 12:56:54.503]  Then she makes another video and puts it on social media and brings more traffic this way.
[12:56:55.023 --> 12:57:01.765]  And it gives these people who might not know about Alex Jones or the Infowars a chance to wake up and kind of get another side of the story.
[12:57:02.085 --> 12:57:06.446]  Hey, I thought that was a peculiar... I think that was an inside job myself.
[12:57:06.566 --> 12:57:08.666]  I never thought anyone else thought that way.
[12:57:08.706 --> 12:57:09.646]  I thought it was just me.
[12:57:09.906 --> 12:57:11.827]  I thought it was bad to be a free thinker.
[12:57:12.657 --> 12:57:24.285]  Well, we want to thank every single one of you who've sat with us for the last 13 hours doing this live coverage from Alex Jones' regular show to the fourth hour into the debate coverage.
[12:57:24.345 --> 12:57:32.490]  Roger Stone, everybody, all the reporters who have been busting their butt all day, everybody in the back, everyone editing videos, cutting clips.
[12:57:32.550 --> 12:57:36.033]  I mean, it has been an all-day, hands-on deck extravaganza.
[12:57:36.053 --> 12:57:39.995]  David Knight and Josh Owens out there getting that epic interview with Nigel Farage.
[12:57:40.035 --> 12:57:42.397]  Be sure and watch that in its entirety and share it.
[12:57:43.398 --> 12:57:46.743]  I'm hearing some words from the control room, but I don't think that they mean anything.
[12:57:46.763 --> 12:57:47.504]  Alright, well that's it.
[12:57:47.604 --> 12:57:52.652]  Thank you for watching the InfoWars live coverage of the third and final presidential debate.
[12:57:52.912 --> 12:57:56.678]  Remember, November 8th, go out and vote and wear your Trump is my president shirt.
[12:57:56.938 --> 12:57:58.000]  We'll be right here.

[12:58:10.011 --> 12:58:12.192]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[12:58:12.293 --> 12:58:19.138]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[12:58:19.338 --> 12:58:22.621]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[12:58:22.641 --> 12:58:23.782]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[12:58:24.102 --> 12:58:30.486]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[12:58:30.726 --> 12:58:31.507]  This is sustainable.
[12:58:31.667 --> 12:58:35.650]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[12:58:35.850 --> 12:58:39.032]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[12:58:39.092 --> 12:58:42.154]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[12:58:42.174 --> 12:58:43.655]  We're looking at the television screen.
[12:58:43.695 --> 12:58:49.339]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[12:58:54.082 --> 12:58:55.043]  We're good to go.

[12:59:18.815 --> 12:59:25.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, with the election just around the corner, I have to ask, have you gotten your Hillary for Prison t-shirt yet?
[12:59:25.560 --> 12:59:28.863]  After the election, this t-shirt will no longer be available.
[12:59:29.103 --> 12:59:34.747]  We only have a finite number of these, so be sure to get to Infowarsstore.com and get yours today.
[12:59:35.268 --> 12:59:39.171]  Even Hillary Clinton supporters like the Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[12:59:39.371 --> 12:59:40.772]  I'm voting for Hillary.
[12:59:41.072 --> 12:59:44.273]  This is a meme that is still viral worldwide.
[12:59:44.493 --> 12:59:45.413]  Hillary for prison.
[12:59:45.713 --> 12:59:51.415]  Folks, we want to see Hillary Clinton put in prison, and we also want to see InfoWars go to the next level.
[12:59:51.775 --> 12:59:58.297]  It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.
[12:59:58.938 --> 12:59:59.858]  Because you'd be in jail.
[13:00:00.658 --> 13:00:01.781]  Help us accomplish both.
[13:00:02.282 --> 13:00:03.664]  Fund us in the Infowar.
[13:00:03.945 --> 13:00:05.888]  Start a political discourse with your neighbor.

[13:01:26.748 --> 13:01:28.129]  Also, tell Google what to do.
[13:01:28.729 --> 13:01:31.290]  Search terms like delist Donald Trump completely.
[13:01:31.310 --> 13:01:31.650]  Remember that?
[13:01:31.670 --> 13:01:36.131]  And then we expose it like whack-a-mole, then they stop for a while, but pop back up.
[13:01:36.231 --> 13:01:37.692]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[13:01:38.832 --> 13:01:42.333]  We're actually in a battle with authoritarians trying to completely take over.
[13:01:42.953 --> 13:01:44.774]  And they say next they're going to shut us off next year.
[13:01:47.555 --> 13:01:50.436]  I'll never stop fighting, but OK, the American people want that.
[13:01:50.456 --> 13:01:53.216]  I mean, I guess I'll just boycott.
[13:01:53.737 --> 13:01:54.617]  OK, whatever.
[13:01:55.785 --> 13:02:00.425]  All you idiots out there that think you're going to get some free stuff now, they are going to rape you financially.
[13:02:00.445 --> 13:02:01.308]  Woo!
[13:02:02.051 --> 13:02:02.654]  Man, you get...
