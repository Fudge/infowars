[00:00:20.154 --> 00:00:22.136]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.196 --> 00:00:26.080]  It is Thursday, May 26, 2016, and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.081]  And I'm Rob Dew.
[00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:28.662]  Here's a look at some of our top stories.
[00:00:32.926 --> 00:00:41.455]  Tonight, Trump crosses the magic number to clinch the Republican nomination, and he sends shivers down the spines of globalist nations.
[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:54.057]  Then, Ron Paul and John McAfee speak out on policies, politicians, and the political process.
[00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:54.979]  And...
[00:00:58.083 --> 00:00:59.945]  We dissect a media lie.
[00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:07.535]  Katie Couric's documentary was edited to make it appear that pro-gun spokesmen were unable to respond to her direct question.
[00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:16.755]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:18.575]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:19.976]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.376]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:26.697]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:30.558]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.759]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.139]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.300]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:02.162 --> 00:03:11.289]  Well, it took a whole mess of primaries, 17 other candidates, and a whole buttload of debates, but Donald Trump has finally won the nomination.
[00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.431]  This came out of the AP this morning.
[00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:15.012]  He has secured enough delegates.
[00:03:15.032 --> 00:03:19.976]  He's at 1,238 right now when they count the, what are they called, the unbound delegates.
[00:03:20.036 --> 00:03:24.860]  When they bring those into account, he's actually got the number he needs to clinch the Republican nomination.
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.201]  Right.
[00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:28.443]  Bernie has his weaponized supporters and protesters.
[00:03:29.164 --> 00:03:30.525]  We've got weaponized delegates here.
[00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.314]  All that's done though, all of Bernie's supporters, they basically assured a Donald Trump nomination.
[00:03:35.334 --> 00:03:36.495]  He didn't even need California.
[00:03:36.535 --> 00:03:36.956]  Exactly.
[00:03:37.536 --> 00:03:42.583]  Can you even imagine how many more delegates he's going to get once they see what happens in California tomorrow night?
[00:03:42.643 --> 00:03:45.226]  He's going to be well over 1350, I think.
[00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:46.368]  They're going to build that wall.
[00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.011]  And that's going to piss off a lot of people who are here illegally, so.
[00:03:51.171 --> 00:03:52.412]  Yeah, no, that's what I'm saying.
[00:03:52.452 --> 00:03:53.712]  It is going to be fireworks there.
[00:03:54.172 --> 00:04:02.997]  Now, this is coming out of Japan Times, and they're saying Trump is sending shivers down the spines of nations who are trying to solidify this global warming pact.
[00:04:03.337 --> 00:04:10.741]  Now, this is something that whoever gets elected, if this goes through before they get elected, they'll have four years until they can undo it.
[00:04:11.181 --> 00:04:17.704]  So Trump has already made it very clear that he is definitely going to be renegotiating this at a bare minimum.
[00:04:18.385 --> 00:04:20.846]  And he said at maximum, he's going to do something else with it.
[00:04:20.906 --> 00:04:30.450]  So all of these globalist nations that have been working on getting around the American people, of course, with these corporations, they're really shivering over a Trump presidency.
[00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:40.555]  And this is something that has really, you know, David Knight has said this is one of the main reasons why he will back Trump, because he wants to knock out those legs that are going to prop up a one world government.
[00:04:40.555 --> 00:04:46.761]  And we've seen time and time again that this whole global warming carbon credit stuff is not about saving the planet.
[00:04:47.302 --> 00:04:49.904]  It is about basically controlling resources.
[00:04:50.024 --> 00:04:50.825]  That's what they want to do.
[00:04:50.865 --> 00:04:58.252]  They want to control the world's resources, put them in a giant pot, and then have, you know, unelected bureaucrats divvy them up how they see fit.
[00:04:58.272 --> 00:05:00.174]  It has nothing to do with the environment.
[00:05:00.555 --> 00:05:02.697]  If it had something to do with the environment, they'd be looking at stuff like
[00:05:03.357 --> 00:05:06.440]  Geoengineering and genetically modified organisms.
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.941]  There's never any talk about that.
[00:05:07.961 --> 00:05:08.982]  It's just carbon.
[00:05:10.944 --> 00:05:13.246]  There's no regulations on fracking out in the ocean.
[00:05:13.507 --> 00:05:17.871]  NOAA, we have them setting off weapons underwater.
[00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:22.695]  They don't really care if that's going to destroy the entire ecosystem.
[00:05:22.935 --> 00:05:25.978]  But you and I need to curtail our breathing.
[00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:29.461]  And it's not just the globalists that are afraid of Trump.
[00:05:29.481 --> 00:05:32.825]  You also have all these people creating Twitter accounts with a calling for his assassination.
[00:05:33.185 --> 00:05:35.087]  And then here's a story from Paul Joseph Watson today.
[00:05:35.508 --> 00:05:41.354]  Beck calls Drudge evil for suggesting he advocated a patriot killed Donald Trump.
[00:05:41.815 --> 00:05:43.176]  And let's just go look at the exchange.
[00:05:43.196 --> 00:05:46.259]  This is between him and one of Beck's minions, Bradthor.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.563]  And I'm about to suggest something very bad.
[00:05:49.603 --> 00:05:50.404]  It's a hypothetical.
[00:05:50.444 --> 00:05:59.336]  I'm going to ask, as a thriller writer, with a feckless, spineless Congress, who will we have who will stand in the way of Donald Trump overstepping his constitutional authority as president?
[00:05:59.576 --> 00:06:04.823]  Yeah, because we've seen the Congress stop, you know, people like Obama or George Bush from overstepping their constitutional authority.
[00:06:05.083 --> 00:06:10.027]  But already, we know Donald Trump's going to overstep his before he's even gotten into office, before he's even won the presidency.
[00:06:10.167 --> 00:06:10.928]  But it'll continue.
[00:06:11.408 --> 00:06:17.133]  If Congress won't remove him from office, what patriot will step up and do that if he oversteps his mandate as president?
[00:06:17.574 --> 00:06:19.916]  His constitution mandate authority as president, I should say.
[00:06:20.256 --> 00:06:22.318]  If he oversteps that, how do we get him out of office?
[00:06:22.358 --> 00:06:24.920]  And I don't think there is a legal means available.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:32.066]  I think it will be a terrible, terrible position the American people will be in to get Trump out of office because you won't be able to do it through Congress.
[00:06:32.446 --> 00:06:33.027]  And then Beck said,
[00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:34.909]  I would agree with you on that.
[00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:35.830]  I mean, what are they thinking?
[00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.531]  So they're thinking they're going to need a revolution to rise up to get Trump out of office?
[00:06:40.651 --> 00:06:41.732]  He hasn't even done anything yet.
[00:06:41.752 --> 00:06:42.572]  I love it.
[00:06:42.592 --> 00:06:43.652]  This is pre-crime.
[00:06:43.672 --> 00:06:48.254]  Can you imagine if they had said something like this about Obama, saying what patriot is going to take him out?
[00:06:48.374 --> 00:06:49.154]  Oh yeah, exactly.
[00:06:49.314 --> 00:06:50.575]  How do you think people are going to interpret that?
[00:06:50.595 --> 00:06:58.017]  Well, Beck wouldn't do that because he's actually in there to keep Obama in office and cover for him, to give right cover, I guess I should say.
[00:06:58.157 --> 00:07:03.026]  Right, because as soon as Ron Paul was no longer a threat, then all of a sudden he backs Ron Paul.
[00:07:03.106 --> 00:07:03.547]  Exactly.
[00:07:03.627 --> 00:07:04.829]  He is a total fake.
[00:07:05.478 --> 00:07:09.180]  Now we have someone else actually coming out challenging Donald Trump.
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.362]  This is Bernie Sanders challenging him to a debate.
[00:07:12.922 --> 00:07:20.867]  This is, Don Salazar has this article up that the socialist candidate is now attempting an upward attack as his campaign is in the death rows.
[00:07:21.347 --> 00:07:30.212]  Jimmy Kimmel gave Donald Trump a statement from the Sanders camp when he appeared on the show the other night and Hillary Clinton declined having a debate.
[00:07:30.532 --> 00:07:32.993]  With Bernie Sanders, because she already knows it's in the bag for her.
[00:07:33.013 --> 00:07:33.953]  She's in free fall too, yeah.
[00:07:34.533 --> 00:07:37.093]  It's not going to help her chances win California whatsoever.
[00:07:37.534 --> 00:07:44.735]  And I personally would like to see the Trump-Sanders debate, even though it'll be pretty meaningless in terms of how this race is going to play out.
[00:07:45.115 --> 00:07:52.517]  But in terms of the socialist versus capitalism theologies going head to head, I think it's what this country needs more than anything.
[00:07:52.677 --> 00:08:00.242]  That's what I think, because we have so many people out there with these Bernie supporters who haven't ever even actually listened to anything that Trump is proposing.
[00:08:00.623 --> 00:08:07.387]  And then to see how does that counter with what Bernie is saying, because I guarantee Trump is going to say, well, how would you pay for that Bernie Sanders?
[00:08:07.667 --> 00:08:07.948]  How?
[00:08:08.068 --> 00:08:09.729]  I'm going to raise a social security tax.
[00:08:10.029 --> 00:08:10.990]  Economics a little bit.
[00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.492]  And people don't understand, like, you have a lot of different taxes taken out of your paycheck.
[00:08:14.892 --> 00:08:20.995]  Just because you may or may not pay income tax at the end of the year, they're still taking payroll tax out, they're taking out Social Security.
[00:08:21.215 --> 00:08:27.539]  There's all kinds of things that Bernie Sanders is going to raise up the level to level the playing field for everyone.
[00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:29.220]  Right.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:38.405]  If you still have a job after you get your $15 an hour, 70% of that is now going to go to taxes, so you're going to be making even less than what you're making right now.
[00:08:38.425 --> 00:08:40.046]  And then the robots are going to replace you even faster.
[00:08:40.146 --> 00:08:40.346]  Right.
[00:08:40.867 --> 00:08:41.927]  Yeah.
[00:08:41.987 --> 00:08:42.928]  Don't learn skills.
[00:08:43.208 --> 00:08:47.230]  Don't take your own destiny into your hands and better yourself in your free time.
[00:08:47.731 --> 00:08:48.371]  Just watch TV.
[00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:48.911]  Don't do it.
[00:08:48.971 --> 00:08:49.672]  Go to Facebook.
[00:08:49.692 --> 00:08:51.573]  Just pound your face on a desk.
[00:08:52.213 --> 00:08:54.134]  Take this hate street off this campus!
[00:08:54.174 --> 00:08:56.074]  Take this hate street off this campus!
[00:08:56.374 --> 00:08:57.375]  Triggly Puff!
[00:08:58.595 --> 00:08:58.995]  I'm sorry.
[00:08:59.635 --> 00:08:59.835]  I know.
[00:08:59.855 --> 00:09:00.956]  I gotta calm down.
[00:09:00.976 --> 00:09:01.716]  Devolving here.
[00:09:02.256 --> 00:09:04.897]  But now we have a new poll out, a new survey.
[00:09:04.957 --> 00:09:07.618]  This is NBC News and the Wall Street Journal.
[00:09:07.978 --> 00:09:15.861]  They conducted a poll and they found that voters most associate Hillary Clinton with the words liar, not trustworthy, and scandals.
[00:09:17.441 --> 00:09:19.983]  We could have told you that, but this is, you know, you're saying on a free fall.
[00:09:20.163 --> 00:09:20.683]  Absolutely.
[00:09:20.783 --> 00:09:27.228]  She is finally getting out there with, like, these little word clouds containing mostly negative words.
[00:09:27.308 --> 00:09:29.270]  People are no longer... You know what?
[00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:34.494]  Actually, we've got some video of Gary McQueen on the streets earlier this year, taking our own poll.
[00:09:35.214 --> 00:09:36.495]  I think I'm ready for a woman.
[00:09:36.515 --> 00:09:37.896]  Okay.
[00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:44.221]  To me, voting for Hillary because she's a woman is like eating a turd because it looks like a tootsie roll.
[00:09:44.301 --> 00:09:44.661]  Very true.
[00:09:46.189 --> 00:09:47.470]  I would agree with that video.
[00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.231]  Hillary does kind of look like a turd.
[00:09:50.052 --> 00:09:52.894]  A tyrannical turd.
[00:09:53.054 --> 00:09:56.157]  A tyrannical turd who wants to take over everything and make everything smell bad.
[00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:58.118]  This came out of the AP today.
[00:09:58.258 --> 00:10:01.361]  Origin of key Clinton emails from report are a mystery.
[00:10:01.721 --> 00:10:03.382]  Now we have mystery emails.
[00:10:03.442 --> 00:10:04.643]  Because she didn't turn those over.
[00:10:04.903 --> 00:10:05.644]  Oh, I forgot.
[00:10:06.517 --> 00:10:13.623]  The agency found an audit of at least three emails never seen before, including Clinton's own explanation of why she wanted to keep her emails private, which we talked about yesterday.
[00:10:14.184 --> 00:10:22.931]  The existence of these previously unreleased messages appeared to be found among electronic files of four former top Clinton State Department aides.
[00:10:23.552 --> 00:10:29.797]  Renews concerned that Clinton was not completely forthcoming when she turned over a trove of 55,000 pages of work-related email.
[00:10:30.057 --> 00:10:30.978]  Yeah, she would never do that.
[00:10:30.998 --> 00:10:31.919]  She said she turned them all over.
[00:10:32.099 --> 00:10:36.982]  And it's drawn fresh criticism from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump.
[00:10:37.342 --> 00:10:46.847]  And it's gotten so bad, even the Washington Post, which is basically water carriers for the liberal establishment, has come out and said, Clinton's inexcusable, willful disregard for the rules.
[00:10:46.867 --> 00:10:48.027]  Inexcusable and willful disregard.
[00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:49.488]  But, of course, I think that's as far as they're going to say.
[00:10:49.628 --> 00:10:53.350]  Yeah, they're not going to say she needs to be trumped out of here by this point.
[00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.791]  Yesterday I was seeing on CNN.
[00:10:56.972 --> 00:10:58.193]  MSNBC, they had on there.
[00:10:58.373 --> 00:11:01.554]  But some of that corroborate her previous statements.
[00:11:01.794 --> 00:11:08.036]  Some of the audit report shows, like, yeah, but also some of it shows what a complete criminal she was.
[00:11:08.136 --> 00:11:09.177]  Willful negligence.
[00:11:09.577 --> 00:11:12.278]  She knew that her computer was being hacked into.
[00:11:12.298 --> 00:11:13.518]  She knows how to spell.
[00:11:13.718 --> 00:11:14.939]  She writes in complete sentences.
[00:11:14.999 --> 00:11:15.719]  Some of it showed that.
[00:11:16.099 --> 00:11:26.813]  It's very clear that she set up that private server because she did not want the State Department to access her personal yoga emails or also selling uranium to the Russians.
[00:11:27.293 --> 00:11:30.377]  Now, let's move on from Hillary Clinton to...
[00:11:31.673 --> 00:11:38.159]  Something else that happened to really disturb me today, a friend sent this link over, the Alamo Draft House.
[00:11:38.259 --> 00:11:41.221]  It's a really, it's a great movie theater here in Austin.
[00:11:41.241 --> 00:11:42.662]  I love to go watch movies there.
[00:11:43.103 --> 00:11:48.988]  But now they are seeking the public's feedback on gender neutral bathroom design.
[00:11:49.528 --> 00:12:01.971]  So this is Tim Leake, he's the Drafthouse founder, and he put these drawings up on the Facebook page of this bathroom idea, which is an inclusive, commercial, gender-neutral restroom design.
[00:12:02.831 --> 00:12:06.632]  So the challenges are not even part of the dialogue.
[00:12:06.652 --> 00:12:08.313]  There's a little man-corral area?
[00:12:08.653 --> 00:12:09.853]  Are those urinals?
[00:12:09.873 --> 00:12:10.773]  What are those?
[00:12:11.174 --> 00:12:12.354]  Okay, so here's the thing.
[00:12:13.334 --> 00:12:18.536]  Basically they're saying that they want the design element to completely eliminate the conflict.
[00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:19.897]  And so how are they going to do that?
[00:12:20.337 --> 00:12:23.238]  They're going to create gender urinals.
[00:12:24.378 --> 00:12:26.739]  Urinals that men and women can use.
[00:12:27.099 --> 00:12:32.642]  So you'll be standing side by side with other people who are standing up to pee.
[00:12:32.682 --> 00:12:33.282]  Are you serious?
[00:12:34.235 --> 00:12:34.936]  I'm serious.
[00:12:35.396 --> 00:12:44.584]  These, I mean, so we have gone, we've gone totally in hyperdrive from gender inclusive to now physics defying.
[00:12:44.684 --> 00:12:47.547]  Because women are not made to pee standing up, first of all.
[00:12:47.667 --> 00:12:50.510]  And I wonder who came up with this, how long it's been going on.
[00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:55.674]  And, you know, because you know this isn't just something that came off the, oh we got a little spider crawling across right now.
[00:12:55.915 --> 00:12:56.715]  Yeah, he's looking for a home.
[00:12:56.735 --> 00:12:57.756]  Weaving spiders come out here.
[00:13:00.007 --> 00:13:04.150]  Anyway, how did they come up with, like, we have this plan ready, like, who came up with this?
[00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:10.033]  And what dark room are they going, we have to get everybody to pee together in the same spot?
[00:13:10.053 --> 00:13:14.215]  Everybody needs to just be comfortable with your little girl standing next to a grown man.
[00:13:14.295 --> 00:13:19.558]  Forget about if it's the man identifies as a woman, just everybody in there all together.
[00:13:19.578 --> 00:13:23.720]  They could just spread newspapers out in corners of the theater and just have people pee in the corners.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:24.060]  Yeah.
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.763]  Or set up, you know, a green space with giant fire hydrants or something.
[00:13:27.823 --> 00:13:30.065]  Everybody could go pee and poop on those.
[00:13:30.306 --> 00:13:37.512]  This is what we need to demand because, you know what, this is just the beginning of this whole transgender, the gender identities.
[00:13:37.632 --> 00:13:40.354]  There's actually 58 gender identities on Facebook.
[00:13:40.654 --> 00:13:44.177]  So we're going to have to start creating bathrooms for everyone.
[00:13:44.197 --> 00:13:45.498]  I mean, how far are we going to take this?
[00:13:45.538 --> 00:13:46.379]  This is just the beginning.
[00:13:46.419 --> 00:13:50.042]  So we also have this article out of The Guardian.
[00:13:50.362 --> 00:13:51.784]  The men who live as dogs
[00:13:52.344 --> 00:13:54.727]  They're just the same as any person on the high street.
[00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:56.710]  Because we have to cater to all mental illnesses now.
[00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:03.078]  These are humans who like to live in packs, play with squeaky toys, eat from bowls, nuzzle their owners.
[00:14:03.458 --> 00:14:06.082]  So this is their identity.
[00:14:06.562 --> 00:14:08.124]  Pump their legs.
[00:14:08.605 --> 00:14:09.606]  This is so weird.
[00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.232]  These guys want to pee with your kids in the bathroom.
[00:14:14.252 --> 00:14:15.453]  These are normal people.
[00:14:15.473 --> 00:14:17.394]  They need to hike their leg up in peace.
[00:14:17.414 --> 00:14:22.699]  That's what we all need to do if we can just have AstroTurf and FireHydrant.
[00:14:22.719 --> 00:14:25.541]  In fact, we have an artist's rendition of what this would look like.
[00:14:26.321 --> 00:14:27.302]  A whole new world.
[00:14:28.323 --> 00:14:29.084]  There it is right there.
[00:14:29.124 --> 00:14:33.007]  We've got FireHydrant, we've got the dogs picking up poop, we've got the dog people.
[00:14:33.607 --> 00:14:36.868]  We've got women peeing in the bushes, giant fire hydrant urinals.
[00:14:36.908 --> 00:14:39.028]  I mean, it's all set up, ready to go.
[00:14:39.048 --> 00:14:41.689]  We should probably submit this as feedback to the Alamo.
[00:14:41.709 --> 00:14:42.589]  Why don't you just do this?
[00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:42.889]  Yes!
[00:14:43.029 --> 00:14:43.590]  This is better.
[00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:44.470]  We can train dogs.
[00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:45.430]  Excellent idea.
[00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:46.190]  You know, there you go.
[00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:47.951]  Let's take it all the way.
[00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:56.413]  If we're just going to do it partially and just have men and women getting together in bathrooms, peeing and pooping together, why don't we do it outside, out in public, so everybody can just see it?
[00:14:56.753 --> 00:14:58.495]  Yeah, well that's what this is all about.
[00:14:58.575 --> 00:15:10.729]  It's like eliminating privacy, eliminating the individual, being a part of the collective, and people are much easier to control if they're part of a collective, rather than trying to control a bunch of little individuals here and there.
[00:15:10.789 --> 00:15:12.972]  It's going to be people in dog masks controlling you, by the way.
[00:15:12.992 --> 00:15:13.773]  Oh my goodness.
[00:15:13.793 --> 00:15:14.594]  But what could go wrong?
[00:15:14.614 --> 00:15:16.516]  What could go wrong if we had men and women peeing together?
[00:15:18.041 --> 00:15:18.922]  Let's look at this article.
[00:15:18.942 --> 00:15:19.763]  This is out of the Daily Mail.
[00:15:20.204 --> 00:15:26.210]  Saudi father shoots doctor shortly after he delivered his wife's baby because he didn't want a man to see his spouse naked.
[00:15:26.511 --> 00:15:26.651]  Right.
[00:15:26.671 --> 00:15:32.498]  So this guy delivers his baby and then he gets killed by the lady's husband.
[00:15:33.001 --> 00:15:41.728]  Well, you know, when my wife gave birth to, I don't know, four kids, there was all kind of people in there every time.
[00:15:41.748 --> 00:15:42.288]  Right.
[00:15:42.948 --> 00:15:44.490]  And that's not what we were concerned about.
[00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:45.831]  We were concerned with having a healthy baby.
[00:15:45.911 --> 00:15:48.973]  Obviously, this guy, I mean, this is the mental illness we're going to be dealing with.
[00:15:49.133 --> 00:15:49.293]  Right.
[00:15:49.453 --> 00:15:51.275]  Well can you imagine these guys sharing a bathroom?
[00:15:51.295 --> 00:15:53.876]  Because we have to let all the Muslims come into our country now.
[00:15:53.896 --> 00:15:54.697]  We're bringing them all in.
[00:15:54.977 --> 00:15:57.559]  You want your transgender bathroom, you're going to get tossed off a building.
[00:15:58.179 --> 00:16:00.961]  Someone's going to toss you off the parking lot at the Alamo Draft House.
[00:16:01.281 --> 00:16:02.362]  So good job guys.
[00:16:02.862 --> 00:16:04.403]  Now this one's coming out of the Federalist.
[00:16:05.024 --> 00:16:13.109]  I thought this was a great article where the author Stella Morabito says a de-sex society is a dehumanized society.
[00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.232]  And this is something that Alex has been talking about for years.
[00:16:16.912 --> 00:16:19.094]  That this is about dehumanizing people.
[00:16:19.454 --> 00:16:22.657]  And so trying to, like, where did this whole transgender thing come from?
[00:16:22.697 --> 00:16:27.622]  We don't even have definitions, yet they're already creating federal laws.
[00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:29.403]  You could be fined.
[00:16:29.703 --> 00:16:32.446]  And it's not like nobody's trying to deny anybody any rights.
[00:16:33.287 --> 00:16:38.932]  It's just, you don't want a guy with a penis going into where women with vaginas go to the bathroom.
[00:16:39.252 --> 00:16:39.933]  What's wrong with that?
[00:16:40.433 --> 00:16:47.099]  Well the thing that really frustrated me is that why do women have to rearrange the way that they've been going to the bathroom for millennia?
[00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:51.403]  Because all of a sudden now they want to have gender neutral urinals.
[00:16:52.064 --> 00:16:52.784]  I mean why?
[00:16:52.805 --> 00:16:54.206]  That's the patriarchy.
[00:16:54.406 --> 00:16:58.970]  I feel very oppressed by the patriarchy telling me that now I need to figure out how to stand up.
[00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.531]  I just keep laughing.
[00:16:59.551 --> 00:17:03.655]  Next time at the Alabama Draft House I'm going to be peeing next to some lady who's like kind of
[00:17:04.375 --> 00:17:08.016]  Squatting next to this weird urinal thing that's supposed to be unisex.
[00:17:08.136 --> 00:17:09.156]  It's absolutely terrible.
[00:17:09.196 --> 00:17:11.136]  This is going to totally backfire on them.
[00:17:11.517 --> 00:17:24.819]  But this article talks about how if you can take away people's sex, male, female, and try to rewrite the reality of science of what it is, then the government can start saying there is no mother, father, no son, no daughter.
[00:17:25.019 --> 00:17:29.460]  It's you're the legal guardian of that person that lives in your home.
[00:17:30.041 --> 00:17:30.761]  And you know what?
[00:17:30.801 --> 00:17:32.261]  Maybe we mold their mind during the day.
[00:17:32.501 --> 00:17:42.028]  Exactly, and maybe we decide you're not fit to be their legal guardian anymore, but you're not their mother or father or they're not your child because the family structure has been completely eliminated.
[00:17:42.249 --> 00:17:43.269]  Oh yeah, that's what they want.
[00:17:43.289 --> 00:17:48.774]  They want kids living in dormitories being raised by the state being subjected to that brainwashing mind control.
[00:17:49.094 --> 00:17:53.957]  Not about individuality, not about freedom, it's all about this weird collective where you can't say
[00:17:54.858 --> 00:17:57.118]  Certain words, because they may offend somebody.
[00:17:57.478 --> 00:17:58.939]  You know, it goes back to the old adage.
[00:17:58.979 --> 00:17:59.879]  And it changes from day to day.
[00:17:59.899 --> 00:18:02.639]  Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.
[00:18:02.759 --> 00:18:06.040]  And the fact that they don't teach kids this anymore is just atrocious.
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:11.401]  Sticks and stones might be breaking some bones, though, if you try to... By the way, we're talking about Trump winning the nomination.
[00:18:11.421 --> 00:18:16.982]  We have a special video from Alex Jones coming up where he goes into this and basically declares Trump winner of the presidency.
[00:18:17.042 --> 00:18:19.362]  Because, I mean, you look at what Hillary is right now.
[00:18:19.402 --> 00:18:20.102]  She's in free fall.
[00:18:20.463 --> 00:18:22.763]  They're probably going to try to sneak Biden in through the back door.
[00:18:23.323 --> 00:18:25.824]  But, you know, people are gonna be like, wait, he didn't go through any scrutiny at all.
[00:18:25.844 --> 00:18:27.084]  We're just gonna say, oh, Joe Biden.
[00:18:27.444 --> 00:18:28.284]  Creepy Joe gets it.
[00:18:28.324 --> 00:18:29.725]  Go buy a shotgun.
[00:18:29.845 --> 00:18:32.245]  Yeah, I can't wait for those hit pieces to come out.
[00:18:32.286 --> 00:18:32.546]  Yeah.
[00:18:32.706 --> 00:18:34.246]  Did you see me trying to shoot the shotgun?
[00:18:35.086 --> 00:18:35.806]  Fail.
[00:18:36.507 --> 00:18:43.749]  We also have an interview with Libertarian candidate running for president, John McAfee, as well as Ron Paul, stopped by the Alex Jones Show today.
[00:18:43.809 --> 00:18:44.689]  All that's coming right up.
[00:19:04.895 --> 00:19:09.297]  There's a very important question that needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.437 --> 00:19:12.098]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.758 --> 00:19:15.759]  And to look at that threat we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.439 --> 00:19:27.183]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type 1 civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.854 --> 00:19:39.220]  You could say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:50.126]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.345]  We're good to go.
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.386]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:31.934]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.418]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:46.732]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:47.934]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.454 --> 00:20:53.499]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription.
[00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:10.395]  Not just that chips are going to be on the pills and medicines themselves, but now you're going to have to give your blood, basically every time, a tiny prick, into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on in your body as well as your genes.
[00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.878]  In this short report we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.991]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:23.995]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Meet Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.934]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:04.097]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:17.542]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:19.763]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:21.424]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:30.126]  We do have that magic spark, but the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:46.631]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in BrainForce, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.
[00:22:47.091 --> 00:22:53.815]  Check out Brain Force today and other game-changing compounds like X2, Survival Shield, at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:23:07.322 --> 00:23:09.624]  Dr. Paul, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[00:23:09.964 --> 00:23:10.464]  You look great.
[00:23:10.484 --> 00:23:13.046]  It's good to have you with us via your Skype connection.
[00:23:13.546 --> 00:23:14.066]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:23:14.106 --> 00:23:14.947]  Good to see you today.
[00:23:15.814 --> 00:23:21.562]  We've got about a two or three second delay, so I'll try to just, you know, not jump in too much, just with a few questions.
[00:23:22.163 --> 00:23:23.244]  You heard what I threw out.
[00:23:23.605 --> 00:23:24.506]  Where would you like to start?
[00:23:24.566 --> 00:23:26.228]  With the moves to censor?
[00:23:26.268 --> 00:23:31.655]  I don't think I've ever seen, with Facebook and all the rest of them being caught, censorship of this magnitude.
[00:23:32.423 --> 00:23:38.328]  I think we live in an age where there's no understanding and no respect whatsoever for personal liberty and personal privacy.
[00:23:38.488 --> 00:23:40.190]  The founders understood it much better.
[00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:45.234]  They tried to protect us against a big government that would come in and destroy that.
[00:23:45.715 --> 00:23:50.539]  But there is a collusion between big business, corporatism, and big government that are
[00:23:50.899 --> 00:23:51.320]  Yes, we are.
[00:24:05.776 --> 00:24:06.617]  But they haven't quit.
[00:24:06.657 --> 00:24:10.860]  They're still challenging us, and you're right, the IRS has not been kind to us.
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:16.104]  They've been after us quite a few different times on some of our organizations, and they continue to do it.
[00:24:16.444 --> 00:24:21.688]  They like to bankrupt us, you know, through all the money you have to spend to try to defend oneself.
[00:24:22.389 --> 00:24:27.673]  But I think what we're witnessing today is a result of an era ending.
[00:24:27.813 --> 00:24:32.316]  And I've talked about this for maybe five plus years, about the end of an era.
[00:24:32.736 --> 00:24:40.702]  Because I believe the era of big government, the progressive era, really exhausted itself probably at the end of the last century.
[00:24:41.302 --> 00:24:44.865]  And now we have just been fidgeting and trying to keep things together.
[00:24:45.465 --> 00:24:51.410]  And that's why, you know, the political parties are in shambles, the economy's in shambles, civil liberties are in shambles.
[00:24:51.871 --> 00:24:56.455]  But the real problem is that the system we have today isn't working.
[00:24:56.675 --> 00:24:57.496]  It's ending.
[00:24:57.676 --> 00:24:59.257]  Keynesian economics doesn't work.
[00:24:59.297 --> 00:25:02.060]  That model is bad and never worked.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.563]  But that was the substitute for fascism and communism.
[00:25:05.623 --> 00:25:07.985]  And the 20th century did a pretty good job
[00:25:08.645 --> 00:25:11.648]  At smashing it, because it's a total failure.
[00:25:12.008 --> 00:25:17.592]  And there are still some who would like to be socialists and think that Venezuela is the way to go and all this nonsense.
[00:25:17.993 --> 00:25:19.434]  But you know, the markets are very powerful.
[00:25:19.454 --> 00:25:22.617]  The markets said that fascism and communism failed.
[00:25:23.177 --> 00:25:29.202]  But the substitute, the American substitute of Keynesianism, economic planning, central banking, inflationism,
[00:25:29.922 --> 00:25:30.642]  We're good to go.
[00:25:49.887 --> 00:26:13.005]  So I think the mess that we're in today is the end of this era, and without anybody admitting this, we and those in the freedom movement have been trying to warn people of this and giving them an option, and quite frankly, I think we're doing fine there, even though, like you mentioned, Alex, on the introduction, you know, statism and big governments, it's alive and well.
[00:26:13.325 --> 00:26:14.126]  But they're bankrupt.
[00:26:14.246 --> 00:26:21.069]  So they will end, just as our empire will end, Keynesian economics will fail, the central banking system is going to fail.
[00:26:21.409 --> 00:26:31.612]  We just have to concentrate on it to energize another generation, that there is an option for this, there is an alternative, and of course that's what I've been working on for quite a few years.
[00:26:32.173 --> 00:26:33.273]  Absolutely, Dr. Paul.
[00:26:33.813 --> 00:26:43.317]  Expanding on that, looking at what the so-called left is doing, allied with the establishment Republicans in this country, similarly in Europe, where I know you've traveled and spoken extensively as well,
[00:26:44.457 --> 00:27:02.582]  They now, because they were discredited last century, as you said, are instead just trying to dumb everyone down and really much overthrow reality and overthrow the engines of free market that are left, because they just can't compete with that even existing, even though it brings down the civilization.
[00:27:02.622 --> 00:27:06.844]  They'd rather rural people, you know, not be able to take care of themselves.
[00:27:06.864 --> 00:27:09.705]  They'd rather city people not be able to take care of themselves.
[00:27:10.205 --> 00:27:10.665]  They'd rather
[00:27:11.705 --> 00:27:19.134]  The whole country and the whole world be poor and rule a huge junk pile instead of a great civilization.
[00:27:19.494 --> 00:27:23.138]  And so my concerns are what do you see them doing in their death throes?
[00:27:23.178 --> 00:27:27.063]  Because even most mainline analysts are starting to agree with you that we're coming to the end of a bubble.
[00:27:27.923 --> 00:27:31.046]  That no matter what the establishment does, they're not going to be able to suppress change.
[00:27:31.426 --> 00:27:32.948]  More and more young people are waking up.
[00:27:33.208 --> 00:27:41.095]  So clearly, I agree with you, this great turning that you've talked about for decades, but you've said is very close for five years, is pretty much here.
[00:27:41.755 --> 00:27:44.638]  But how do you expect the empire to strike back?
[00:27:44.658 --> 00:27:45.559]  I mean, I think we're seeing it.
[00:27:45.959 --> 00:27:47.681]  Open, naked authoritarianism.
[00:27:48.041 --> 00:27:51.184]  But doesn't that only accelerate the fall of their system?
[00:27:51.844 --> 00:27:54.666]  Well, yes, they're a failure, but they will strike out.
[00:27:54.947 --> 00:27:59.811]  And I think that what they have going for them right now is the dumbing down of America.
[00:27:59.911 --> 00:28:10.920]  So, in many ways, they have been successful by getting hold of the public school system and teaching people, you know, bad economics and bad foreign policy and all the things that are wrong.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.903]  But at the same time, you know, the failure is there.
[00:28:15.004 --> 00:28:20.068]  I think they know that the failure is there, but they will strike out and they will become more authoritarian.
[00:28:20.128 --> 00:28:22.050]  And I think that is exactly what they're doing.
[00:28:22.611 --> 00:28:28.957]  And it isn't a partisan thing when you know that the Nancy Pelosi's of the world and the John Boehner's of the world were
[00:28:29.797 --> 00:28:31.478]  Much more buddies than anybody realizes.
[00:28:31.538 --> 00:28:32.419]  But that continues.
[00:28:32.459 --> 00:28:34.680]  The parties mean very little.
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:41.463]  But I think if nothing else, this current election cycle that's going on represents the dumbing down of America.
[00:28:41.924 --> 00:28:46.206]  But then again, does that mean we should be exhausted and run for the hills?
[00:28:46.566 --> 00:28:47.747]  Or should we continue the fight?
[00:28:47.807 --> 00:28:49.528]  Obviously, I'm here for the fight.
[00:28:50.008 --> 00:28:51.609]  And to me, it's an intellectual fight.
[00:28:52.129 --> 00:28:54.330]  And we have to beat them with better ideas.
[00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:56.871]  And I think there is a receptive audience out there.
[00:28:58.132 --> 00:29:04.414]  They have power because they're in control right now, but what we have on our side is that ideas have consequences.
[00:29:04.674 --> 00:29:06.174]  You can't stop ideas.
[00:29:07.075 --> 00:29:12.396]  Even the armies and the governments can't stop ideas if their time has come.
[00:29:20.878 --> 00:29:23.079]  Joining us now is John McAfee.
[00:29:23.119 --> 00:29:23.959]  Welcome, Mr. McAfee.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.360]  Thank you very much.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:26.160]  I'm happy to be here.
[00:29:26.861 --> 00:29:28.622]  I'm very interested to hear your voice.
[00:29:28.662 --> 00:29:30.382]  I think the Libertarian Party needs your voice.
[00:29:30.422 --> 00:29:32.483]  I think America needs your voice in this discussion.
[00:29:32.543 --> 00:29:34.944]  We are threatened with a lot of vital issues.
[00:29:35.024 --> 00:29:40.726]  I think the border issues, the trade issues that we see that Donald Trump has tapped into, I think those are vital issues.
[00:29:40.766 --> 00:29:43.187]  But there's another vital issue that nobody is talking about.
[00:29:43.707 --> 00:29:47.150]  And that is the big brother aspect of massive surveillance.
[00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:51.654]  And there's many other issues that I don't really see candidates like Gary Johnson addressing.
[00:29:52.414 --> 00:30:01.361]  Four years ago, when he was running, he basically focused his campaign on government redefining marriage, on being pro-abortion, and on pot legalization.
[00:30:01.421 --> 00:30:07.206]  Which is fine, except that those first two things are not even necessarily something that all libertarians agree on.
[00:30:07.586 --> 00:30:09.847]  We had pro-life libertarians when I was in the Libertarian Party.
[00:30:10.367 --> 00:30:13.428]  A lot of people don't believe that the government should have any role in defining marriage.
[00:30:13.848 --> 00:30:19.570]  And when it comes to pot legalization, that's fine, but I think we need to focus on the broader problems of drug prohibition in general.
[00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:25.051]  Then I was very disturbed to see that he's picking William Weld, a guy who has supported assault weapon bans.
[00:30:25.512 --> 00:30:27.572]  He has supported other gun control measures.
[00:30:27.632 --> 00:30:31.673]  He supported the Iraq War ten months, ten months after the invasion.
[00:30:32.374 --> 00:30:33.934]  He's failed to oppose the Patriot Act.
[00:30:33.994 --> 00:30:36.295]  As a matter of fact, he worked as a DEA enforcer
[00:30:36.875 --> 00:30:37.715]  For Ed Meese!
[00:30:38.375 --> 00:30:41.396]  And this is a guy who gave us civil asset forfeiture.
[00:30:41.716 --> 00:30:48.999]  Now he eventually forced Ed Meese out for personal corruption charges, but he should have forced him into jail for giving us something like civil asset forfeiture.
[00:30:49.019 --> 00:30:56.881]  So I'm very disturbed to see the Libertarian Party moving in the direction of having these career politicians, which is what Gary Johnson and
[00:30:58.061 --> 00:30:59.422]  William Weld are, in my opinion.
[00:30:59.462 --> 00:31:03.944]  I think they need to be brought into the 21st century with issues like you're addressing.
[00:31:04.304 --> 00:31:09.887]  Talk to us about the vitality of cyber security and what we need to do to protect us from the government.
[00:31:11.087 --> 00:31:14.729]  Well, with your permission, sir, I'd like to talk about something far more important.
[00:31:15.089 --> 00:31:15.389]  Sure.
[00:31:15.409 --> 00:31:16.470]  We're talking about issues.
[00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:20.611]  But there's an issue that absolutely no one has addressed.
[00:31:21.392 --> 00:31:25.954]  And that is, when Dwight Eisenhower left office in the 50s, he warned us
[00:31:26.713 --> 00:31:30.534]  about something called the military-industrial complex.
[00:31:31.034 --> 00:31:37.936]  That connection between government and industry, which would only cause greater power in both of those.
[00:31:40.676 --> 00:31:43.097]  Gary Johnson talks about presidential debates.
[00:31:43.157 --> 00:31:46.357]  If we don't get into the debate, we're lost, so he's suing the debate commission.
[00:31:46.637 --> 00:31:50.358]  Well, we know that's not going to go to court until after the election.
[00:31:50.398 --> 00:31:53.299]  We know how the court process works, so it's utter nonsense.
[00:31:55.002 --> 00:32:01.527]  At the Las Vegas debate that Penn and Teller put together, I did the debate like everybody else.
[00:32:01.947 --> 00:32:17.098]  In my closing statement, I got up and said, what you have watched is utter, complete nonsense, fabricated by the media in the 60s and perpetrated by the media for the media.
[00:32:17.118 --> 00:32:17.939]  And let me explain.
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.841]  What do you have in a presidential debate?
[00:32:21.721 --> 00:32:29.768]  You have opening statements and closing statements written by speechwriters, not the candidate himself.
[00:32:30.589 --> 00:32:34.112]  You have a candidate that has been coached by dozens.
[00:32:37.133 --> 00:32:39.475]  As a matter of fact, I think we lost transmission there for a moment.
[00:32:39.855 --> 00:32:53.267]  One of the founders of the Libertarian Party was a speechwriter for Goldwater, who had that famous comment, extremism in defense of liberty is no vice, and moderation in defense of justice is no virtue, if I got that correct.
[00:32:53.307 --> 00:32:55.529]  I may not have gotten that exactly right, but you're exactly right.
[00:33:02.375 --> 00:33:04.757]  A lot of people ask me, what is the most important
[00:33:06.286 --> 00:33:06.546]  I think?
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.
[00:33:57.342 --> 00:34:05.626]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, when products are sold out, you're unable to get them, sometimes for months, but we hold back the products for people that have already signed up for AutoShip.

[00:34:29.474 --> 00:34:30.494]  Now it's finally here.

[00:34:49.859 --> 00:34:53.400]  You add to that free shipping on orders of $50, it is a can't lose.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:04.122 --> 00:37:12.385]  Remember when the American president boldly proclaimed a respect of liberty and the freedoms expressed in the Constitution of the United States?
[00:37:12.805 --> 00:37:17.707]  We should give particular attention to the needs of those countries which share our view of the world crisis.
[00:37:17.907 --> 00:37:22.769]  Our view of the world crisis is that countries are entitled to national sovereignty and independence.
[00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:24.370]  That is all we have ever suggested.
[00:37:25.188 --> 00:37:27.469]  That is the purpose of our aid, to make it more possible.
[00:37:28.129 --> 00:37:38.132]  Now if a country has ceased to choose national sovereignty, or ceased to choose national independence, then of course our aid becomes less useful.
[00:37:38.892 --> 00:37:41.913]  Well, take a look at who is steering the ship today.
[00:37:49.011 --> 00:38:12.366]  The New World Order panderer-in-chief, President Obama was recently in Vietnam hyping the prospect of slashing tariffs on products imported into the United States, aggressively pushing a multinational corporation's sovereign killing trade deal, linking 40% of the global economy into a full-blown smackdown on the already struggling U.S.
[00:38:12.446 --> 00:38:12.926]  economy.
[00:38:13.166 --> 00:38:14.427]  The LA Times writes,
[00:38:14.927 --> 00:38:23.735]  Ordinarily, a presidential administration would wait until Congress ratifies a trade agreement before putting it into force with member nations.
[00:38:24.036 --> 00:38:40.471]  But with just eight months left in office and presidential candidates Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, and Bernie Sanders all against the deal, Obama and his advisors appear to have concluded that they must speed up that lengthy process to preserve the trade pact.
[00:38:40.811 --> 00:38:49.560]  This president of ours is blatantly taking this country down and spreading his belly full of total loathing for America across the globe.
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:56.467]  This is the same president that signed the NDAA in the middle of the night after threatening to veto a document.
[00:38:56.587 --> 00:39:03.991]  Guaranteeing that American citizens can be disappeared by the authorities without any explanation, much less their rights.
[00:39:04.251 --> 00:39:09.695]  These people are saying that the passing of the bill, basically it means to them that the Rubicon has been crossed.
[00:39:10.295 --> 00:39:17.239]  That this means America will become complete, and possibly irreversible, a totalitarian military state.
[00:39:17.459 --> 00:39:20.341]  Well then our only hope is some defective armed force members.
[00:39:20.361 --> 00:39:25.424]  I think that's our only chance, is the military needs to enforce our Constitution and our Congress.
[00:39:26.144 --> 00:39:27.026]  We're good.
[00:39:33.359 --> 00:39:34.240]  That's the whole problem.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:38.182]  There's too much corruption in the executive branch and in the congressional.
[00:39:38.463 --> 00:39:45.187]  The same president behind a draft to install a government official into each home to oversee your children.
[00:39:45.688 --> 00:40:00.818]  The document states, the first step in systematically embedding effective family engagement practices in educational settings is to establish a culture where families are seen as assets and partners in children's development.
[00:40:00.878 --> 00:40:01.979]  The same president
[00:40:02.179 --> 00:40:18.412]  That lied his tail off to get into office in order to enact globalist New World Order directives while simultaneously rewarding the corporate demons running the central banks with toppled regimes and more central banks.
[00:40:18.912 --> 00:40:24.476]  Obama is the first president in US history to not see a single year of 3% GDP growth.
[00:40:26.838 --> 00:40:32.402]  That is who was apologizing to Japan and Vietnam for the rhetoric of Donald Trump.
[00:40:32.962 --> 00:40:33.703]  They're rattled by it.
[00:40:34.263 --> 00:40:34.963]  And for good reason.
[00:40:35.344 --> 00:40:52.755]  Because a lot of the proposals that he's made display either ignorance of world affairs or a cavalier attitude or an interest in getting tweets and headlines instead of actually thinking through what it is that is required to keep America safe and secure and prosperous.
[00:40:53.155 --> 00:40:56.597]  If they're rattled in a friendly way, we're gonna have great relationships with these countries.
[00:40:56.637 --> 00:40:58.417]  He's a president who's done a horrible job.
[00:40:58.598 --> 00:40:59.778]  Everybody understands that.
[00:40:59.818 --> 00:41:03.960]  He's a president who's allowed many of these countries to totally take advantage of him.
[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:05.861]  And us, unfortunately.
[00:41:06.161 --> 00:41:07.902]  And he's gotta say something.
[00:41:07.962 --> 00:41:11.223]  And it's unusual that every time he has a press conference, he's talking about me.
[00:41:11.644 --> 00:41:13.124]  Say what you want about Trump.
[00:41:13.164 --> 00:41:16.206]  The majority group who support Trump are...
[00:41:17.381 --> 00:41:20.102]  White families with a lot of money.
[00:41:20.242 --> 00:41:20.762]  How be it?
[00:41:21.242 --> 00:41:28.204]  You are an absolute fool if you can't stomach the facts and realize that Obama is a thousand times worse.
[00:41:28.524 --> 00:41:37.606]  In years to come, if the United States is still here, we will be adamantly apologizing for electing President Barack Obama to two terms.
[00:41:38.106 --> 00:41:43.207]  In America, there's a failure to appreciate Europe's leading role in the world.
[00:41:44.741 --> 00:41:55.664]  Instead of celebrating your dynamic union and seeking to partner with you to meet common challenges, there have been times where America has shown arrogance and been dismissive.
[00:41:56.565 --> 00:42:13.530]  John Bound for Infowars.com We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations a new world order, a world where the rule of law
[00:42:14.597 --> 00:42:18.141]  Not the law of the jungle governs the conduct of nations.
[00:42:19.402 --> 00:42:25.287]  When we are successful, and we will be, we have a real chance at this new world order.
[00:42:25.988 --> 00:42:34.777]  An order in which a credible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the UN's founders.
[00:42:35.557 --> 00:42:36.979]  It is a big idea.
[00:42:36.999 --> 00:42:39.121]  A new world order.
[00:42:40.464 --> 00:42:44.385]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a New World Order.
[00:42:45.145 --> 00:42:52.266]  After 1989, President Bush said, and it's a phrase that I often use myself, that we needed a New World Order.
[00:42:52.426 --> 00:43:05.349]  There is a chance for the President of the United States to use this disaster to carry out what his father, a phrase his father used I think only once, and hasn't been used since, and that is a New World Order.
[00:43:05.449 --> 00:43:07.829]  So that the problem of the Bush presidency
[00:43:08.863 --> 00:43:11.525]  We'll be the emergence of a new international order.
[00:43:12.446 --> 00:43:16.268]  Within the next four years, we will see the emergence of a new international order.
[00:43:16.288 --> 00:43:16.569]  The beginning.
[00:43:16.589 --> 00:43:19.831]  The beginning of a new international order.
[00:43:20.171 --> 00:43:21.192]  The pieces are in flux.
[00:43:22.052 --> 00:43:23.373]  Soon they will settle again.
[00:43:24.554 --> 00:43:25.235]  Before they do,
[00:43:26.755 --> 00:43:28.615]  Let us reorder this world around us.
[00:43:29.496 --> 00:43:38.958]  I think its task will be to develop an overall strategy for America in this period when really a new world order can be created.
[00:43:38.978 --> 00:43:40.298]  It's a great opportunity.
[00:43:40.398 --> 00:43:42.599]  It isn't just a crisis.
[00:43:43.259 --> 00:43:46.300]  It's about the future of Europe and a new world order.
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.321]  There's a need for a new world order.
[00:43:50.421 --> 00:43:54.242]  But it has different characteristics in different parts.
[00:43:56.963 --> 00:44:05.127]  But today, with Asia already outproducing Europe, India and China are clearly becoming part of our new order.
[00:44:06.708 --> 00:44:08.789]  We are now facing a common challenge.
[00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:18.414]  And the challenge is how to build a world order for the first time in history.
[00:44:21.362 --> 00:44:25.703]  So, in conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, a new world is emerging.
[00:44:26.764 --> 00:44:33.045]  It is a new world order with significantly different and radically new challenges.
[00:44:34.385 --> 00:44:43.067]  The affirmative task we have now is to actually create a new world order.
[00:44:43.882 --> 00:44:52.892]  Good evening everybody, President Obama and British Prime Minister Gordon today calling for a new world order to tackle our global economic crisis.
[00:44:53.587 --> 00:44:57.890]  And the president outlined his vision of a new world order in which the U.S.
[00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:59.331]  would participate fully.
[00:44:59.952 --> 00:45:05.315]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:45:05.596 --> 00:45:10.059]  So I see a world order in the future with a multipolar world order.
[00:45:10.439 --> 00:45:17.304]  I think a new world order is emerging and with it the foundations of a new and progressive era of international cooperation.
[00:45:17.704 --> 00:45:19.746]  But in a globalized economy,
[00:45:20.592 --> 00:45:28.822]  We are going to have to take global responsibilities, and there is going to have to be some semblance of global governance.
[00:45:29.302 --> 00:45:36.751]  Never before has a new world order had to be assembled from so many different perceptions, or on so global a scale.
[00:45:37.665 --> 00:45:49.555]  Nor has any previous order had to combine the attributes of the historic balance of power system with global democratic opinion and the exploding technology of the contemporary period.
[00:45:49.795 --> 00:45:56.620]  And I strongly believe India will be a central actor in the new world order.
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:46:03.446]  There also exists an extraordinary opportunity to form, for the first time in history, a truly global society.
[00:46:04.256 --> 00:46:11.479]  2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the G20 in the middle of the financial crisis.
[00:46:12.499 --> 00:46:18.821]  The climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our planet.
[00:46:19.041 --> 00:46:21.622]  New World Order is the headline in the Globe and Mail in Canada.
[00:46:22.062 --> 00:46:24.103]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:46:24.203 --> 00:46:25.163]  Is it one world?
[00:46:25.203 --> 00:46:26.624]  The central banker's in charge.
[00:46:26.684 --> 00:46:30.185]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:46:30.205 --> 00:46:30.945]  Of course we are.
[00:46:31.005 --> 00:46:33.566]  We are absolutely slaves to central banks.
[00:46:35.457 --> 00:46:36.271]  I think.

[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.782]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.902 --> 00:47:16.705]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:47:16.925 --> 00:47:20.207]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.227 --> 00:47:21.408]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.991]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.

[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:35.299 --> 00:48:37.600]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.701]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.

[00:49:05.239 --> 00:49:05.800]  Welcome back.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:07.922]  Joining me in the studio now is Joe Biggs.
[00:49:07.942 --> 00:49:10.584]  You have just gotten back from the annual NRA event.
[00:49:10.625 --> 00:49:13.547]  Of course, they announced that they were backing Trump there.
[00:49:13.567 --> 00:49:14.308]  How did it go?
[00:49:14.328 --> 00:49:15.189]  It was pretty awesome.
[00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:20.414]  I mean, to be around 70,000 people who are just like you, maybe not as cool as me.
[00:49:21.135 --> 00:49:29.405]  But it was pretty awesome, I mean, to see all the new weapons, like the neatest new tactical equipment, ammunition that's not out there on the market, you know.
[00:49:29.765 --> 00:49:31.908]  There's two guns that were made out of a meteorite.
[00:49:32.028 --> 00:49:33.710]  I mean, it was amazing.
[00:49:34.211 --> 00:49:36.433]  Guns all over the place, beautiful women with guns.
[00:49:36.954 --> 00:49:37.555]  It was a dream.
[00:49:38.004 --> 00:49:40.226]  So you weren't frightened by all those guns?
[00:49:40.246 --> 00:49:41.346]  Nah, I mean I was surprised.
[00:49:41.366 --> 00:49:50.313]  You know, I've listened to Hillary Clinton from time to time and you know the way she makes it sound like these guns are just gonna jump up off these counters and shoot me in the head and not one person was shot there the entire time.
[00:49:50.653 --> 00:49:54.236]  It actually ended up being one of the safest places in America for about three days straight.
[00:49:55.389 --> 00:49:55.890]  Most likely.
[00:49:56.250 --> 00:50:05.221]  So did anyone there, I know you had the opportunity to speak, did anyone there kind of get into a lot of this push for gun control?
[00:50:05.241 --> 00:50:09.826]  I know some people were asked there at the NRA event how they felt about gun control.
[00:50:10.667 --> 00:50:12.089]  What was the air like there?
[00:50:12.685 --> 00:50:17.827]  Everybody was pretty stoked at the time that I got there because, you know, they had just announced that the NRA was going to back Trump.
[00:50:18.287 --> 00:50:26.269]  So everybody was kind of like walking around with their chest out a little bit more because they knew that, alright, if the NRA is going to back this guy, we're going to go in, you know, all the way.
[00:50:26.929 --> 00:50:33.531]  So it was a pretty happy crowd and I don't think a lot of people are really, I don't know, like I'm kind of on the fence.
[00:50:33.591 --> 00:50:34.672]  I think a lot of this is
[00:50:35.512 --> 00:50:37.834]  I think the Democrats are kind of playing a game.
[00:50:38.555 --> 00:50:42.239]  Sometimes I feel like they're the silent partners in a company.
[00:50:42.619 --> 00:50:45.963]  But every time they say they're going to push for gun control, what happens?
[00:50:46.023 --> 00:50:46.964]  Gun sales go up.
[00:50:46.984 --> 00:50:47.384]  Surge.
[00:50:47.825 --> 00:50:49.186]  I think there's something they're doing.
[00:50:49.206 --> 00:50:50.587]  Playing both sides of the fence.
[00:50:51.288 --> 00:50:51.689]  I don't know.
[00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:12.194]  Complete swipe at people who believe in the Second Amendment.
[00:51:12.234 --> 00:51:30.208]  It was supposed to be a documentary that showed both sides of the gun control issue, and now some of the people, the Virginia Citizens Defense League, they say they were interviewed for this supposed fair and balanced documentary, and they were completely edited in a deceptive way.
[00:51:30.268 --> 00:51:31.930]  And you have to remember, this is Katie Couric.
[00:51:32.350 --> 00:51:41.695]  Oh, well this is Katie Couric who came out against the Planned Parenthood videos that surfaced and really got behind the charge that those videos were deceptively edited.
[00:51:42.195 --> 00:51:46.698]  Here, you're going to see here that they actually engaged in deceptive editing.
[00:51:47.078 --> 00:51:53.581]  So she's talking to the VCDL and she asks them how they feel about gun control.
[00:51:54.502 --> 00:51:56.103]  Let me ask you another question.
[00:51:56.423 --> 00:52:00.005]  If there are no background checks for gun purchasers,
[00:52:00.563 --> 00:52:04.683]  How do you prevent felons or terrorists from purchasing a gun?
[00:52:14.619 --> 00:52:21.041]  So as you can see, they want to make it appear as though these people have absolutely no counter-argument to, you know, what would you do?
[00:52:21.061 --> 00:52:23.002]  A terrorist could just walk in and get a gun.
[00:52:23.042 --> 00:52:30.304]  And this is the big argument that they're always making, that they're trying to say, this is why we need a gun registry, gun control.
[00:52:32.205 --> 00:52:38.828]  The VCDL has actually come out with their version of the unedited audio and it's actually five minutes long.
[00:52:39.048 --> 00:52:40.749]  Everyone had a really great response.
[00:52:40.829 --> 00:52:44.171]  Totally shut Katie down and that part was edited out.
[00:52:44.231 --> 00:52:44.811]  Take a listen.
[00:52:45.931 --> 00:52:52.515]  How do you prevent felons or terrorists from walking into say a licensed gun dealer and purchasing a gun?
[00:52:54.378 --> 00:52:57.821]  One, if you're not in jail, you should still have your basic rights.
[00:52:58.421 --> 00:53:01.504]  So if you're a terrorist or a felon?
[00:53:01.984 --> 00:53:05.247]  If you're a felon and you've done your time, you should have your rights.
[00:53:05.267 --> 00:53:15.455]  Well, the fact is we do have statutes, both at the federal and state level, that prohibit classes of people from being in possession of firearms.
[00:53:15.855 --> 00:53:19.939]  So, as you can see, they weren't stunned into silence with Katie's question.
[00:53:20.782 --> 00:53:22.003]  I mean, this is what you have to remember.
[00:53:22.664 --> 00:53:36.616]  When you go out and you're speaking truth, or you're an organization that's pro-Second Amendment, or you do like we do at InfoWars, whenever you go to one of these mainstream media places, you always bring your own camera crew for this reason alone.
[00:53:36.656 --> 00:53:43.863]  So kudos to these guys for being smart enough to go in there and film the actual interview so they can take that back when they go out
[00:53:44.443 --> 00:53:44.944]  I think so.
[00:54:03.965 --> 00:54:13.714]  Right, and that'll become the even bigger story, and now people can challenge Katie Couric's journalistic integrity, and as we know, this is not the first time deceptive editing has been used.
[00:54:14.194 --> 00:54:24.184]  Meanwhile, the establishment media will go ahead and they won't back up anything with the whole Planned Parenthood videos, and she was one of the main culprits in this, speaking to her huge audience.
[00:54:24.875 --> 00:54:28.677]  Well, speaking of hatchet jobs, it looks like Bernie is challenging Trump to a debate.
[00:54:29.137 --> 00:54:32.299]  So things might get bloody in a rumble down under.
[00:54:32.319 --> 00:54:35.501]  This is an article by Don Salazar, Democrat candidate.
[00:54:35.541 --> 00:54:43.705]  Bernie Sanders has challenged Republican nominee Donald Trump to a debate ahead of the California primary amid mathematical improbabilities.
[00:54:44.105 --> 00:54:46.927]  The Brooklyn socialist will win his party's nomination.
[00:54:47.367 --> 00:54:50.649]  Now, during a Jimmy Kimmel Live interview Wednesday, the host presented Trump
[00:54:51.129 --> 00:54:57.676]  With a statement from the Sanders campaign requesting a debate after Democrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton declined.
[00:54:58.056 --> 00:54:59.598]  So what do you think about this Leanne?
[00:54:59.618 --> 00:55:03.382]  We've kind of been, I don't know, I've been kind of excited to see if this is ever going to happen.
[00:55:03.402 --> 00:55:04.063]  What do you think?
[00:55:04.824 --> 00:55:07.126]  Well no wait, so she declined debating Donald Trump?
[00:55:07.426 --> 00:55:10.690]  She declined to debate Bernie Sanders again.
[00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:14.061]  Wow, because she doesn't even want to give him any more attention.
[00:55:14.081 --> 00:55:15.641]  Well, she thinks it's over already.
[00:55:15.741 --> 00:55:22.842]  Yeah, she's, well, I mean, it's in the bag because, of course, all those weaponized protesters were focusing all of their attention on Trump rather than Hillary.
[00:55:23.042 --> 00:55:25.103]  Well, and her weaponized superdelegates as well, too.
[00:55:25.123 --> 00:55:26.123]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:55:26.203 --> 00:55:28.323]  Well, I think it would be pretty interesting.
[00:55:28.363 --> 00:55:34.844]  I know Donald Trump said he'd be down for it as long as the money for all the ratings would go to, like, supporting women's groups.
[00:55:35.265 --> 00:55:36.105]  So, I'm down.
[00:55:37.665 --> 00:55:40.827]  We're going to be in California June 7th, so I think we should go to this.
[00:55:41.047 --> 00:55:41.707]  Oh, for sure.
[00:55:41.747 --> 00:55:47.810]  If there's ever going to be any kind of clash of any kind, Bernie Sanders supporters hate Trump.
[00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:52.312]  Trump supporters aren't going to be violent unless they're, you know, pushed to that limit.
[00:55:52.352 --> 00:56:01.576]  Well, I feel like maybe the Bernie supporters, because they admit when you go and you counter their argument, that they haven't even listened to anything Donald Trump has to say.
[00:56:01.676 --> 00:56:03.397]  All they've been given is those talking points.
[00:56:03.777 --> 00:56:05.238]  Racist, homophobic, xenophobic.
[00:56:05.638 --> 00:56:13.665]  Maybe they'll actually have the opportunity to listen to two candidates who, on both sides, are very popular with the nation.
[00:56:14.125 --> 00:56:16.167]  So maybe they'll be able to learn something.
[00:56:16.527 --> 00:56:17.668]  I'm just curious if it's good, though.
[00:56:17.688 --> 00:56:21.731]  I mean, look, Trump's actually not going to be going up against Bernie.
[00:56:22.252 --> 00:56:24.394]  So at the end of the day, it really doesn't do him any good.
[00:56:25.074 --> 00:56:27.575]  I mean, at the end of the day, all that could really happen is it could hurt him, so I don't know.
[00:56:27.595 --> 00:56:28.395]  I'm kind of confused.
[00:56:28.415 --> 00:56:30.455]  I'm not really sure if that's a good choice.
[00:56:30.535 --> 00:56:35.197]  I mean, if anything, call Hillary out and debate her, and let's get those skeletons out of the closet.
[00:56:35.217 --> 00:56:37.917]  I want to see Trump and Hillary one-on-one.
[00:56:37.937 --> 00:56:39.358]  I want to see everything come out.
[00:56:39.698 --> 00:56:40.698]  I want to find out about the skeletons.
[00:56:40.718 --> 00:56:46.819]  Well, it's going to happen, because, you know, Trump was able to secure the amount of delegates needed to secure the Republican nomination, so.
[00:56:47.099 --> 00:56:48.840]  Now he's got to find out who he's going to pick as VP.
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:51.980]  And I'm telling you, I was just in Kentucky.
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:53.301]  I got Rand Paul.
[00:56:53.581 --> 00:56:54.661]  My buddy's good friends with him.
[00:56:54.701 --> 00:56:55.521]  I'm trying to let him know.
[00:56:55.961 --> 00:56:56.462]  We need you.
[00:56:56.742 --> 00:57:02.283]  Well, we really need him to stay where he is because the VP has no power unless the president can take him out.
[00:57:02.323 --> 00:57:11.825]  Yeah, but if we get a new Gingrich in there, I don't... Rand Paul does way too much good to be the VP, though, because then he'll take him from a powerful position into, like, a dud position.
[00:57:12.145 --> 00:57:13.466]  But that would be pretty awesome.
[00:57:13.646 --> 00:57:15.566]  I wish I could be voting for Rand Paul.
[00:57:16.426 --> 00:57:17.167]  Anything else here?
[00:57:17.187 --> 00:57:17.967]  We got about a minute.
[00:57:18.227 --> 00:57:18.567]  ISIS G5.
[00:57:19.087 --> 00:57:22.268]  Is jihadists allowed to spew hate on Twitter for six months without being banned?
[00:57:22.728 --> 00:57:32.872]  You know, we still have kill Donald Trump sites up on, or pages on Facebook, and yet these guys can go around and brag about killing people and post videos, propaganda pieces all day long, no one bats an eye, no one gets mad.
[00:57:33.152 --> 00:57:34.093]  Well, I'm sick and tired of it!
[00:57:35.629 --> 00:57:36.049]  Ban them.
[00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:37.030]  Get rid of them.
[00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:37.430]  Yeah.
[00:57:37.770 --> 00:57:40.451]  You should see some of the things that people post up on Twitter.
[00:57:40.491 --> 00:57:42.312]  Why don't we see people at Trump rallies?
[00:57:42.693 --> 00:57:43.913]  Stop burning the American flag.
[00:57:43.933 --> 00:57:46.014]  Why don't you start burning the ISIS flag?
[00:57:46.034 --> 00:57:47.255]  I want to see everybody.
[00:57:47.295 --> 00:57:52.077]  I forgot to say, I'm going to be in San Diego tonight with Josh Owens at the San Diego Trump rally tomorrow at 2pm.
[00:57:52.097 --> 00:57:52.778]  Make sure you're there.
[00:57:53.118 --> 00:57:53.898]  Get an ISIS flag.
[00:57:53.918 --> 00:57:54.719]  Let's burn that.
[00:57:54.779 --> 00:57:55.999]  Let's show them what to really burn.
[00:57:56.519 --> 00:57:57.800]  Stop burning the American flags.
[00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:58.881]  Stop bringing Mexican flags.
[00:57:59.181 --> 00:58:00.001]  This is America.
[00:58:00.301 --> 00:58:00.581]  Alright?
[00:58:00.601 --> 00:58:01.182]  Sounds like a real flag.
[00:58:01.202 --> 00:58:02.702]  We're Americans, not Americans.
[00:58:02.923 --> 00:58:03.443]  So be there.
[00:58:04.693 --> 00:58:05.934]  All right, that's going to be tomorrow.
[00:58:05.994 --> 00:58:08.235]  Obviously, we're going to be very excited to have you guys on the ground.
[00:58:08.335 --> 00:58:17.300]  And just based on what we've seen at all of these Trump rallies, and especially this one being in California with such a huge minority population, I predict fireworks.
[00:58:17.981 --> 00:58:19.141]  I dare someone to throw a rock at me.
[00:58:20.042 --> 00:58:20.182]  Yeah.
