[00:00:17.463 --> 00:00:17.884]  17 seconds.
[00:00:30.701 --> 00:00:33.765]  I'm not gonna sit here and take it anymore!
[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.862]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:36.943 --> 00:00:41.469]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo and Joe Biggs, and we have the rest of the crew here tonight.
[00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:49.599]  We've got Eric McBrain, we have Jakari Jackson, Richard Reeves is going to be live in Houston because tonight is the final debate.
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.644]  Before the Super Tuesday this coming five days, just five days away.
[00:00:55.044 --> 00:00:59.207]  We're going to have the biggest primary day so far.
[00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:05.412]  There's going to be 14 states that are going to have one or both parties holding an election this coming Tuesday in five days.
[00:01:05.453 --> 00:01:10.377]  So tonight is the debate between the five remaining candidates on the GOP side there in Houston.
[00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:12.078]  We'll be covering that live.
[00:01:12.198 --> 00:01:16.962]  This is going to be very interesting tonight because their backs are against the wall and their shirts are on fire.
[00:01:18.303 --> 00:01:18.723]  I agree.
[00:01:18.743 --> 00:01:21.145]  I think this is actually going to be a debate to watch.
[00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:30.792]  So they're clawing at each other's throats there to try and be that one person who could possibly be this second contender there to Trump.
[00:02:01.676 --> 00:02:03.037]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:02:03.337 --> 00:02:04.617]  You can't survive without it.
[00:02:04.818 --> 00:02:05.718]  But where do you get it?
[00:02:06.018 --> 00:02:11.781]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:17.724]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:34.769]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:37.290]  Filter capacity up to 5000 gallons.
[00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.851]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:02:39.131 --> 00:02:39.891]  Easy assembly.
[00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:40.791]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:41.072 --> 00:02:42.892]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.745]  And let's dispel once and for all this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:03:07.765 --> 00:03:09.287]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:03:09.327 --> 00:03:17.360]  We have to make America rich again, and make America great again.
[00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:29.519]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News, live coverage of the final GOP debate before Super Tuesday in just five days.
[00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:35.042]  As we were saying in the first segment, this is going to be a do-or-die situation.
[00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:45.388]  Last night in Manhattan, Marco Rubio's campaign manager got a lot of big donors in Manhattan together and tried to lay out that there is still a chance
[00:03:45.908 --> 00:03:46.008]  Wow.
[00:03:46.048 --> 00:03:46.228]  Wow.
[00:03:46.248 --> 00:03:46.308]  Wow.
[00:04:05.598 --> 00:04:07.699]  Taking off and left them in the dust.
[00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:15.581]  Really tonight is a debate between Cruz and Rubio to see who's really going to come out on top because we already know that America's pretty much spoken.
[00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:16.241]  They want Trump.
[00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:19.282]  People are showing up in record numbers, filling out coliseums.
[00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:21.742]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:04:21.782 --> 00:04:23.003]  I mean, this is what it is for tonight.
[00:04:23.023 --> 00:04:34.746]  And it's going to be interesting to see after tonight or next week if Cruz or Kasich, or not Cruz, but Carson or Kasich finally just kind of give up and move on out and stop wasting money because obviously it's not working for them right now.
[00:04:34.966 --> 00:04:37.307]  Right, well they're just kind of wanting to take those extra votes.
[00:04:37.808 --> 00:04:45.252]  Well, you know, it's interesting to look at, and of course you can see this story at the top of Drudge, about 200 people, 200 donors get together in Manhattan and look at this.
[00:04:45.272 --> 00:04:51.295]  They're trying to make the case that, well, look, if some of these guys drop out, you're talking about who's going to be number two, I don't know that's going to help them.
[00:04:51.576 --> 00:04:55.498]  He's talking about, well, if Kasich and Carson drop out, okay, we've got a chance.
[00:04:55.538 --> 00:05:00.861]  But if you look at his home state, and Rubio's home state, Rubio, Kasich, and Carson, all three of them together.
[00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:02.762]  Don't total up what Trump has, okay?
[00:05:02.922 --> 00:05:11.848]  You take Rubio and Cruz, the other two top two challengers, those together don't equal Trump in Rubio's own home state.
[00:05:12.208 --> 00:05:13.749]  So he's got a big problem.
[00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:20.634]  And of course, Ted Cruz has got a big problem because he was counting on winning throughout the Southeast, getting evangelical votes.
[00:05:20.854 --> 00:05:21.775]  Those went to Trump.
[00:05:21.995 --> 00:05:22.255]  Yeah.
[00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:29.440]  And so that was going to be his game plan to win in the Southeast, to win in Texas, to get a big lead, to try to get out front and hold that.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.981]  But it's not working out for either of them.
[00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:35.704]  No, and that's what they're all kind of saying, you know, you get out so that I can be the one to win.
[00:05:36.084 --> 00:05:38.866]  And they're all saying there's no way you're going to be able to beat Trump.
[00:05:38.906 --> 00:05:41.728]  There's no way you or you would be able to beat Clinton.
[00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:57.879]  So, well, you know, we're hoping they're going to talk about issues tonight, but you know, on most of the issues, there's, there's not that much difference between them, you know, until you look at things like the, uh, border issue, which, uh, there's a big difference between them, the big difference between them on trade treaties, that type of thing.
[00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:08.026]  I think it's going to boil down to a lot of personal attacks tonight, but I think that there's one thing that we need to play, and if you guys can get the clip up, I want to play this first.
[00:06:08.206 --> 00:06:10.847]  We've also got a clip from Houston.
[00:06:10.887 --> 00:06:19.311]  We've got Richard Reeves who is there with live coverage, and of course Richard Reeves is the one who gave Jeb Bush two big black eyes on 9-11.
[00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:20.551]  I think so.
[00:06:41.512 --> 00:07:02.121]  Yeah, and so this is UH where they're saying that this is one of the most diverse, second most diverse campus in the nation, and the Republican frontrunners who will be given a stage at the school have said very discriminatory things against our students, so they were basically saying we are going to be there in full force tonight too.
[00:07:02.261 --> 00:07:03.242]  No, they're going to be on the outside.
[00:07:03.262 --> 00:07:04.283]  They're not going to be on the inside.
[00:07:04.663 --> 00:07:07.185]  Only six people in the audience are going to be students.
[00:07:07.606 --> 00:07:11.509]  They're tightly holding these tickets for the establishment.
[00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:13.611]  And that brings us to our next clip that I want to play.
[00:07:14.012 --> 00:07:19.336]  I want to pull up this clip from Reince Priebus, who is the RNC chair.
[00:07:19.797 --> 00:07:23.180]  It was an amazing admission, and I want you to look at this carefully.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.222]  We're going to have a lot to say about this in the coming days.
[00:07:25.822 --> 00:07:34.488]  He's talking to CNN's Allison Camerota and she asked him the question, is it time for the GOP to embrace Trump as the frontrunner?
[00:07:34.948 --> 00:07:37.009]  And I want you to hear how he responds.
[00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:39.571]  Let's run that clip.
[00:07:40.572 --> 00:07:41.452]  Maybe they don't have that clip.
[00:07:41.632 --> 00:07:42.993]  Okay, they're going to get that clip.
[00:07:43.453 --> 00:07:50.758]  I want you to see how he responds because what it shows is what an elitist establishment perspective this is.
[00:07:50.778 --> 00:07:51.479]  Let's play that clip.
[00:07:54.134 --> 00:08:00.702]  You ask the question in a way that I think is a little bit... These folks are competing to join us.
[00:08:00.722 --> 00:08:02.504]  I mean, that's what's happening, right?
[00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:06.008]  So they're competing to join the Republican Party.
[00:08:06.028 --> 00:08:06.970]  They're competing to join us.
[00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.153]  Depending on what the delegates decide to do on the wheels.
[00:08:11.214 --> 00:08:11.694]  Well, sort of.
[00:08:11.734 --> 00:08:12.715]  I mean, but they're competing.
[00:08:12.735 --> 00:08:12.995]  Well, sort of.
[00:08:13.015 --> 00:08:14.195]  I mean, but they're competing.
[00:08:40.834 --> 00:08:56.039]  I mean, this is... Understand the process that's going on here because Reince Priebus, chair of the RNC, is trying to explain to you that you may think that this is an election for president, but what these people are doing is competing to join them, as he puts it.
[00:08:56.079 --> 00:08:56.279]  Join us.
[00:08:56.299 --> 00:08:59.460]  And Trump has made it clear he doesn't want to be beholden to the establishment.
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:06.922]  Meanwhile, these other guys are going out and their commercials coming out are saying, you want someone who's going to be against the establishment?
[00:09:07.022 --> 00:09:08.002]  Go for Rubio.
[00:09:08.022 --> 00:09:09.403]  Come to the dark side.
[00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:10.483]  Exactly.
[00:09:10.523 --> 00:09:11.504]  Come to the dark side.
[00:09:11.524 --> 00:09:12.245]  What are they doing?
[00:09:12.565 --> 00:09:13.806]  Are they pledging a fraternity?
[00:09:14.827 --> 00:09:17.689]  Are the debates really kind of a hazing process?
[00:09:18.029 --> 00:09:19.010]  It's like Waterborne.
[00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.911]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:20.511]  That's what Eric said.
[00:09:20.531 --> 00:09:21.312]  Not even tour insurance.
[00:09:22.112 --> 00:09:23.393]  Low-level college hazing.
[00:09:23.934 --> 00:09:25.015]  Okay, so here's a question.
[00:09:25.695 --> 00:09:32.439]  Did Rubio and Cruz and Kasich, did they not join the Republican Party when they became senators and governors?
[00:09:32.479 --> 00:09:33.119]  Because that's what it says.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.141]  The nominee joins the Republican Party.
[00:09:36.161 --> 00:09:36.822]  That's what's happening.
[00:09:37.082 --> 00:09:37.882]  They're joining us.
[00:09:37.902 --> 00:09:38.523]  They're joining us.
[00:09:38.643 --> 00:09:41.604]  And so it's like there is a Republican Party where the voters are.
[00:09:41.704 --> 00:09:44.086]  There's another Republican Party where some of these office holders are.
[00:09:44.446 --> 00:09:47.808]  And there's the inner circle of the establishment.
[00:09:48.008 --> 00:09:52.770]  It's like there's hunting clubs and then there's hunting clubs.
[00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:59.974]  You might be a hunter but you're not a green wardrobe dancing around the fire with satanic sculptures.
[00:10:00.234 --> 00:10:07.138]  Guys, one of the services you have to go through to get into Skull & Bones is you lay in a coffin and you just talk about your sexual history.
[00:10:07.338 --> 00:10:10.260]  Right, and you're naked, and they all stand around you with robes.
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.661]  This could be the same type of thing.
[00:10:11.681 --> 00:10:18.486]  They're asking about your history, they're asking you to answer some questions that might be uncomfortable, and if you get through that process, then you're good to go.
[00:10:18.666 --> 00:10:22.229]  So you have to get in a coffin, naked, and have Megyn Kelly ask you questions?
[00:10:22.249 --> 00:10:26.632]  So these are non-Republicans competing to be in the Republican spot?
[00:10:26.652 --> 00:10:28.313]  Because I thought this was the Republican debate.
[00:10:28.573 --> 00:10:29.794]  Yeah.
[00:10:29.834 --> 00:10:32.735]  This is really about the Elitist Club.
[00:10:32.995 --> 00:10:35.016]  Are you capable of joining the Elitist Club?
[00:10:35.116 --> 00:10:37.758]  Otherwise, they're going to get all these donors together and try to get you out.
[00:10:37.798 --> 00:10:38.938]  And it's not working for them.
[00:10:39.199 --> 00:10:43.741]  They spent $150 million on Jeb alone and got zero out of it.
[00:10:43.841 --> 00:10:44.521]  Zero out of it.
[00:10:45.022 --> 00:10:53.006]  I hate this visual, guys, but George W. Bush, he had to get in a coffin and talk about all that stuff in front of his dad.
[00:10:54.747 --> 00:10:54.787]  Oh.
[00:10:55.147 --> 00:10:55.788]  Skull and bones.
[00:10:55.808 --> 00:10:57.409]  My dad knows everything.
[00:10:57.449 --> 00:10:58.270]  Must have been awkward.
[00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.853]  I'm sure they were together for a few things.
[00:11:02.434 --> 00:11:13.044]  Well, this is what's so interesting to me about what he, Reince, said, was that it's like, no, America, you might really have come out in full force for a particular candidate.
[00:11:13.604 --> 00:11:14.845]  But that doesn't matter.
[00:11:15.185 --> 00:11:20.329]  What matters is if we accept him into our club and allow him to be your president.
[00:11:20.349 --> 00:11:20.649]  That's right.
[00:11:20.669 --> 00:11:22.610]  That's what we've been saying all of these times.
[00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:30.896]  Well that's going to wake a lot of people up because you're going to see people coming out in record numbers filling up coliseums and you're looking at when Jeb was running, you're looking at like Rubio's numbers.
[00:11:30.936 --> 00:11:38.040]  I mean no one can compare to the amount of people that Trump's bringing and if this elite club picks Rubio or Cruz or something, which probably won't happen.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.121]  Or if they do, a broker
[00:11:39.121 --> 00:11:39.902]  We're good to go.
[00:12:03.942 --> 00:12:06.185]  So now break this down for me with the Brokered Convention.
[00:12:06.265 --> 00:12:20.340]  So I know that that was one of the reasons why I was kind of excited to get to go to one of the conventions this year, because of the way these delegates are working, and obviously the popular vote is going for Bernie Sanders versus Hillary, or here, Trump versus one of these other establishments.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.245]  Well, it's kind of the metaphorical thing you've always heard of, the smoke-filled room, okay?
[00:12:24.946 --> 00:12:30.232]  I remember as a child, the Republican and Democrat conventions were typically always brokered.
[00:12:30.612 --> 00:12:32.334]  And so it was really kind of interesting.
[00:12:32.354 --> 00:12:35.437]  Now it's more of a beauty pageant or a parade of like, look who your candidate is.
[00:12:35.558 --> 00:12:35.778]  Exactly.
[00:12:39.722 --> 00:12:44.025]  For the last several decades, it's been decided well before they get there, okay, through the primary system.
[00:12:44.345 --> 00:12:48.108]  Because they said, we don't want smoke-filled rooms and all this stuff done in private.
[00:12:48.368 --> 00:12:50.549]  We would all sit there, not knowing what was going to happen.
[00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:54.072]  I mean, they'd already had primary votes and that sort of thing, but we wouldn't really know what was going to happen.
[00:12:54.292 --> 00:13:00.016]  They would call the roll call vote from each one of these states and they had live coverage on the floor with Walter Cronkite and all these guys doing it.
[00:13:00.276 --> 00:13:03.139]  And that's the way, by the way, the Libertarian Party is.
[00:13:03.219 --> 00:13:05.662]  It's actually kind of fun to participate in a couple of those as a delegate.
[00:13:06.022 --> 00:13:11.989]  So it's interesting, okay, but it is still a club, okay, and you're competing to join them, you know.
[00:13:12.469 --> 00:13:16.193]  But that's a core thing for people to understand.
[00:13:17.193 --> 00:13:25.797]  Right's previous RNC chair continued to repeat that, and Alison Camerota just like, well, no wait a minute, we're having an election here.
[00:13:25.817 --> 00:13:26.757]  No, no, no, you don't understand.
[00:13:26.777 --> 00:13:27.698]  They're joining us.
[00:13:27.758 --> 00:13:28.338]  We're having an election.
[00:13:28.358 --> 00:13:29.678]  And this went on for quite some time.
[00:13:29.698 --> 00:13:31.359]  We could play that clip for a lot longer.
[00:13:31.659 --> 00:13:33.180]  He wanted to get that clear.
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.421]  You're joining us.
[00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:38.142]  This is our private club, and we're going to exercise our control to keep that.
[00:13:38.202 --> 00:13:39.823]  And that's one of the things I think really hurt
[00:13:40.243 --> 00:13:48.386]  Rand Paul, at the very beginning, at least with me, I supported Rand Paul until he got out because of where he was on civil liberties issues and other constitutional issues.
[00:13:48.426 --> 00:13:51.127]  But I was very disappointed in him in the very first question.
[00:13:51.147 --> 00:14:04.411]  I remember Megyn Kelly, or it wasn't Megyn Kelly that asked it, but it was one of the guys at the first debate, says to Trump, well says to all of them, would you leave the party, because it was directed at Trump, would you leave the party if you don't get the nomination?
[00:14:04.451 --> 00:14:05.692]  And he honestly raised his hand.
[00:14:06.232 --> 00:14:08.733]  And then they came after him, but Rand Paul came after him.
[00:14:08.753 --> 00:14:10.353]  And I thought, why does that matter?
[00:14:10.713 --> 00:14:11.834]  Why does that matter to Rand?
[00:14:12.154 --> 00:14:12.514]  You know?
[00:14:12.534 --> 00:14:12.734]  Yeah.
[00:14:12.754 --> 00:14:15.895]  Because he had had, I guess, he knows a secret handshake or something.
[00:14:15.935 --> 00:14:16.275]  I don't know.
[00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:19.996]  But it really disappointed me to see that that mattered so much to him.
[00:14:20.016 --> 00:14:20.116]  Yeah.
[00:14:20.256 --> 00:14:23.337]  Because it mattered more to him than a lot of these civil liberties issues.
[00:14:23.657 --> 00:14:25.217]  He got so angry at Trump.
[00:14:25.257 --> 00:14:28.898]  And that was the first sparks of the, right there, the very first question.
[00:14:29.278 --> 00:14:31.259]  And it was like, why is that an important issue?
[00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:45.703]  Right, yeah, and it's, I mean, just watching now with the establishment being so kind of shaking in their boots with who their candidate might actually be, it's just kind of waking up the rest of the world to say it's time for a third party.
[00:14:46.063 --> 00:14:49.864]  Time to break up this two-party system because we see the game is rigged.
[00:14:49.924 --> 00:14:51.204]  They cannot hide it anymore.
[00:14:51.667 --> 00:14:56.351]  You know, there's another article, and I don't have it here on my desk, but I pretty much remember what it was about.
[00:14:56.631 --> 00:15:01.956]  It was the article that was at the top of Drudge this afternoon, where the former president of Mexico, uh, okay.
[00:15:02.336 --> 00:15:03.837]  We will not build that wall.
[00:15:03.937 --> 00:15:06.079]  He says, we will not build the effing wall, okay?
[00:15:06.459 --> 00:15:08.962]  Well, that was the headline, and that was an interesting headline.
[00:15:09.002 --> 00:15:11.784]  He's trying, I guess, in an inarticulate way to express his anger.
[00:15:12.605 --> 00:15:18.890]  However, if you look at what he said, he said, I was very disappointed to see that 44% of the Hispanics voted for Trump.
[00:15:19.474 --> 00:15:21.916]  Now, that's the majority of Hispanics in the Nevada election.
[00:15:22.196 --> 00:15:26.519]  And then the former Mexican president says, I want to know who those people are.
[00:15:26.539 --> 00:15:28.941]  It's like, well, I'm sorry, you don't get a chance to do that.
[00:15:29.221 --> 00:15:32.623]  But he goes on to say, this isn't about our race.
[00:15:33.364 --> 00:15:35.325]  This isn't about our creed.
[00:15:35.385 --> 00:15:36.206]  And I'm thinking, what?
[00:15:36.566 --> 00:15:37.126]  What is this?
[00:15:37.206 --> 00:15:39.508]  It's like everything breaks down along racial lines.
[00:15:39.528 --> 00:15:40.969]  Hey, it's not Mexico.
[00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:45.834]  But I mean, it's breaking down along racial lines, because remember, La Raza is the race, okay?
[00:15:46.054 --> 00:15:46.875]  Viva La Raza!
[00:15:47.095 --> 00:15:50.319]  Yeah, it's very racist the way they set this up.
[00:15:50.339 --> 00:15:52.581]  They come at this with a very racist perspective.
[00:15:52.902 --> 00:15:59.529]  I don't know what he meant by our creed, but then he says, if you are, you need to do this for the country that is hosting you.
[00:15:59.909 --> 00:16:01.990]  And it's like, wait a minute, hosting you?
[00:16:02.491 --> 00:16:06.614]  If this country is hosting somebody, they don't get to vote in the election.
[00:16:06.794 --> 00:16:24.226]  And I'm glad that the 44% of the people who were Hispanic there, the majority of them were doing what they, you know, the majority of them were not voting along some kind of a racist line, not seeing themselves as being hosted by a country, doing, exercising their right to do that as citizens of this country.
[00:16:24.366 --> 00:16:30.388]  Right, and that's what Trump has said a lot, that he has support of the Hispanic population.
[00:16:30.628 --> 00:16:35.489]  But they do not want to believe it, just like they don't want to believe that there could be black people that want to vote for Trump.
[00:16:35.789 --> 00:16:38.070]  How dare you get off that thought plantation?
[00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:46.612]  But the Mexican president is assuming that non-citizens from his country, or non-citizen Hispanics, are voting in our elections.
[00:16:46.952 --> 00:16:52.015]  He says do this for your host country, not for your country that you belong to, that you have loyalty to.
[00:16:52.335 --> 00:16:59.398]  You know, we know you're special race, you've got your own creed, and you really don't belong to this country, you know, but do it for them.
[00:16:59.418 --> 00:17:01.399]  I mean, what kind of a remark is that?
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:11.205]  That bothered me a lot more than his effing comment, you know, which is like, okay, I know English isn't your first language, but if you have to resort to that to try to impress people, okay, fine, you know.
[00:17:12.485 --> 00:17:20.148]  But what he had to say, to me, just portrayed a rabid racism and an expectation that non-citizens are going to vote in our election.
[00:17:20.288 --> 00:17:20.468]  Right.
[00:17:20.688 --> 00:17:22.149]  And I don't think it's an expectation.
[00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:27.171]  I mean, I think they've made it pretty clear that they have the voting, the polls open.
[00:17:27.191 --> 00:17:27.771]  That's right.
[00:17:27.811 --> 00:17:30.492]  And you guys are talking about, you guys are talking about hosting.
[00:17:30.532 --> 00:17:32.453]  This is Carrie Jackson over in the Situation Room.
[00:17:32.773 --> 00:17:35.294]  I have a clip here, David, I think you may find very interesting.
[00:17:35.334 --> 00:17:36.754]  This is the RNC chairman.
[00:17:36.774 --> 00:17:38.275]  He said this just a moment ago.
[00:17:42.073 --> 00:17:45.234]  Chakari Jackson on our playback station, instant replay.
[00:17:45.674 --> 00:17:48.315]  We're not getting any audio from that, so.
[00:17:48.935 --> 00:17:49.135]  Yeah.
[00:17:51.756 --> 00:17:52.376]  Is there any audio?
[00:17:52.396 --> 00:17:53.197]  I don't hear any audio.
[00:17:53.217 --> 00:17:54.277]  Chakari, read what it says.
[00:17:54.717 --> 00:18:01.239]  Okay, well basically this is the RNC chairman saying that these guys are pretty much competing to join the party.
[00:18:01.279 --> 00:18:03.240]  He doubled down on that too.
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.001]  It's an honor to be with Mrs. Bush and President Bush.
[00:18:06.061 --> 00:18:07.881]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:18:08.122 --> 00:18:08.562]  Thank you so much.
[00:18:10.852 --> 00:18:12.254]  Sorry about Jeff.
[00:18:12.434 --> 00:18:14.296]  We did everything we could for Jeff.
[00:18:14.316 --> 00:18:17.380]  As you may remember, he was also chairman of the RFC.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.663]  I'll let you guys know when something else pops up.
[00:18:19.743 --> 00:18:28.134]  Okay, so what you heard there Jakari was, and we missed the audio of it, but he's repeating that line again that they're competing to join his little personal party.
[00:18:28.454 --> 00:18:31.016]  And the elites up there, the Bushes, that he's honoring.
[00:18:31.056 --> 00:18:33.138]  That's just amazing.
[00:18:33.178 --> 00:18:41.065]  We need to let Primus know that this isn't his own little personal party, and if it is, let's open up the process to more than just these two parties.
[00:18:41.105 --> 00:18:42.106]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.981]  We believe in win-win, folks.
[00:19:12.041 --> 00:19:13.763]  Treating people like we want to be treated.
[00:19:14.004 --> 00:19:18.569]  That's why we developed NutraCyticals with Dr. Group and other top researchers, chemists, scientists, you name it.
[00:19:18.709 --> 00:19:19.671]  He's one of our advisors.
[00:19:19.931 --> 00:19:25.418]  To come up with products like AnthroPlex that is an original product that he made just for us.
[00:19:26.339 --> 00:19:28.241]  And this is a base
[00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:34.052]  System to make super male or super female vitality work even better.
[00:19:34.752 --> 00:19:36.093]  It is natural.
[00:19:36.513 --> 00:19:40.414]  It just helps get your body pumping and going in the way you need to be going.
[00:19:40.795 --> 00:19:54.480]  And Dr. Group is here until we go to break to tell us about the latest product at Infowarslife.com, AnthroPlex, that out of the gates, and we do this all the time with the new product, we discount it out of the gates to get you to try it, knowing that you're going to love it.
[00:19:55.478 --> 00:19:56.119]  It'll sell out.
[00:19:56.439 --> 00:20:07.232]  So, Infowarslife.com, Anthroplex, 15% off and free shipping for the next two days only when you get it with Supermail or Female Vitality.
[00:20:07.352 --> 00:20:08.153]  Let's go to Dr. Group.
[00:20:08.313 --> 00:20:14.180]  Why do you call this the foundation to start the fire and then the Supermail takes you to the next level?
[00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:32.217]  Well, we just look at the base problem that's going on right now all over the world, which is the endocrine-disrupting chemicals, the amount of estrogen that men have, the femininity of men, and what's going on even in children right now with low testosterone levels.
[00:20:32.697 --> 00:20:39.601]  Low sperm count levels and the problems that in the attack that we're seeing on the endocrine systems of both male and female.
[00:20:40.102 --> 00:20:49.127]  So I'm always looking for ways to boost that and to make it more effective and naturally get the body to start producing these hormones and balancing themselves.
[00:20:49.927 --> 00:21:00.034]  So what we decided to do is how can we add a few other components in there that would actually boost the effectiveness of the super male vitality and at the same time
[00:21:00.974 --> 00:21:05.338]  ...address different issues that the male might have, so there'd be a full approach.
[00:21:05.398 --> 00:21:06.498]  And one of those was zinc.
[00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:09.841]  And zinc is actually necessary for the production of testosterone.
[00:21:10.422 --> 00:21:14.745]  There's more and more studies coming out that zinc is essential for hormone balancing.
[00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:33.262]  Well the horny goat weed was given that name because years ago in India they noticed that a certain time of the year this weed would grow and the goats would eat it and they would just go crazy with all the female goats.
[00:21:33.322 --> 00:21:34.864]  So that's how it was developed.
[00:21:34.884 --> 00:21:35.825]  It's called epimidium.
[00:21:36.625 --> 00:21:43.309]  And what that's been proven to do over thousands of years is increase sexual pleasure, help balance the male hormones.
[00:21:43.349 --> 00:21:45.110]  It can actually be used for women as well.
[00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:52.414]  But it really kind of resets and brings the hormone balance, improves sperm motility, and increases testosterone levels.
[00:21:52.454 --> 00:21:54.415]  So it counters the stuff they've been throwing at us.
[00:21:54.696 --> 00:21:56.276]  Results will vary overall.
[00:21:56.697 --> 00:21:58.518]  All I know is dynamite.
[00:21:58.958 --> 00:22:03.821]  I mean, absolutely dynamite with the stamina, with the weightlifting, with the swimming.
[00:22:04.081 --> 00:22:05.382]  Folks, the new product is available.
[00:22:05.982 --> 00:22:09.045]  Anthroplex, available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:09.426 --> 00:22:11.548]  Dr. Group, thank you for developing this amazing product.
[00:22:11.708 --> 00:22:12.009]  Thank you.
[00:23:34.905 --> 00:23:42.412]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News, live coverage of the final GOP debate before Super Tuesday in just five days.
[00:23:42.492 --> 00:23:47.396]  As we were talking in the last segment, we were talking about Rubio's path to the nomination.
[00:23:47.416 --> 00:23:52.641]  Of course, there was an amazing confession from Rubio that went up on TPM.
[00:23:52.861 --> 00:23:56.284]  He said, you don't win the nomination by how many states you win.
[00:23:57.315 --> 00:23:59.196]  You don't win the nomination by how many steps.
[00:23:59.216 --> 00:24:00.816]  That's how desperate he is.
[00:24:01.276 --> 00:24:07.718]  That's how much he is talking in circles to try to make a case that he still has a chance in this race.
[00:24:08.138 --> 00:24:09.278]  And of course, they met with donors.
[00:24:09.779 --> 00:24:17.921]  200 donors in Manhattan met last night talking about the only path he really has left at this point, and that is a brokered convention.
[00:24:18.081 --> 00:24:19.401]  Well, two plus two does equal five.
[00:24:19.481 --> 00:24:20.181]  That's right.
[00:24:20.362 --> 00:24:21.722]  He is getting desperate, though.
[00:24:22.182 --> 00:24:24.983]  He's holding out for the GOP foam party, we all know.
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.083]  That's Wayne Madsen's research there, there you go.
[00:24:29.383 --> 00:24:44.038]  Yeah, he is getting very desperate when he calls Breitbart a conspiracy website because they talked to the president of the ICE union who said that when he was testifying, trying to testify before the Gang of Eight, Rubio had him ejected, was standing by, as he said, I was
[00:24:44.719 --> 00:24:45.520]  I know what it is.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.922]  As a law enforcement officer, I know what it is to be under arrest.
[00:24:50.122 --> 00:24:53.425]  He goes, I was in custody and I was yelling loudly, am I under arrest?
[00:24:53.485 --> 00:24:55.926]  And he goes, and the Rubio people kind of backed off at that point.
[00:24:56.246 --> 00:24:59.008]  And they took me out and he goes, oh, they're a conspiracy website.
[00:24:59.028 --> 00:25:00.029]  That guy is a liar.
[00:25:00.069 --> 00:25:03.291]  And they said, well, you know, Cavuto said, really, Breitbart?
[00:25:04.171 --> 00:25:05.192]  A conspiracy site?
[00:25:05.432 --> 00:25:09.876]  And then other people point out that Rubio had written op-ed pieces for that conspiracy site.
[00:25:09.916 --> 00:25:19.363]  So he's desperate to do this, and of course the officer was backed up by other law enforcement officers who were there to testify at the time, said, no, I saw it, it is as he described.
[00:25:20.084 --> 00:25:24.007]  And he has now challenged Rubio to go on television and debate him about that.
[00:25:24.027 --> 00:25:25.308]  So that's going to be a core thing tonight.
[00:25:25.568 --> 00:25:28.950]  I wouldn't be surprised to see the other candidates bring that up as they have.
[00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:30.792]  We also said he wasn't an ICE agent as well.
[00:25:31.132 --> 00:25:31.352]  Right.
[00:25:31.412 --> 00:25:32.513]  And that's when he wrote that letter.
[00:25:32.553 --> 00:25:33.253]  He said, you know what?
[00:25:33.373 --> 00:25:37.495]  He's like, I want you to come out, meet with me, and I'll bring you my credentials, my badge, and all that.
[00:25:37.515 --> 00:25:38.455]  And you can see that I am.
[00:25:38.755 --> 00:25:39.976]  We'll show everyone that you're lying.
[00:25:40.216 --> 00:25:40.396]  Yeah.
[00:25:40.676 --> 00:25:40.876]  Yeah.
[00:25:41.297 --> 00:25:42.597]  So now that's how desperate he is.
[00:25:42.617 --> 00:25:45.559]  16 points behind in his own state.
[00:25:46.319 --> 00:25:50.221]  Even if you combine his polling with Cruz, Cruz had 12%
[00:25:51.301 --> 00:25:53.442]  That doesn't even get him up to the level of Trump.
[00:25:53.482 --> 00:25:55.482]  So, there's not much of a path there.
[00:25:55.502 --> 00:26:03.365]  Now, let's talk a little bit about Cruz tonight, because Cruz has said he's going to be fighting in Texas, and he goes, and he made the reference himself, to the Alamo.
[00:26:03.425 --> 00:26:04.906]  He goes, yeah, it's like the Alamo in 1836.
[00:26:04.946 --> 00:26:08.687]  Well, of course, ultimately everyone died in the Alamo, but when he said that,
[00:26:09.227 --> 00:26:11.770]  Reminded me, and Jakari, you probably remember this as well.
[00:26:12.851 --> 00:26:25.645]  When we were doing the 1,000 people or so that were having the open carry rally at the Alamo, and Alex Jones was speaking there, along with Jerry Patterson, who was the Texas land commissioner, a lot of politicians were speaking there.
[00:26:25.665 --> 00:26:26.586]  It was an election year.
[00:26:27.587 --> 00:26:28.648]  As that was happening,
[00:26:29.571 --> 00:26:40.055]  Ted Cruz, who had already been elected Senator, was across the street at the Hyatt Regency holding a fundraiser with some little old ladies at a tea party.
[00:26:40.075 --> 00:26:45.517]  Yeah, you got all these armed citizens walking around and you got this supposedly pro-gun guy who can't bother to show up.
[00:26:45.818 --> 00:26:59.243]  Like I said, Jerry Patterson was out there, you know, a bunch of the open carriers were out there, police officers were out there whether they wanted to be or not, but Cruz couldn't be bothered to even walk by, you know, shake somebody's hand, you know, take a selfie or something like that.
[00:26:59.603 --> 00:27:02.285]  Even the gun grabbers went out there.
[00:27:02.385 --> 00:27:03.045]  Yeah, that's true.
[00:27:03.065 --> 00:27:05.067]  Even the gun grabbers went out there.
[00:27:05.407 --> 00:27:18.676]  How do you have a situation where somebody who is supposedly so hardcore on the Second Amendment can sit there and essentially, the image that I had in my mind was this image from Toy Story, I think the third one, where you got Buzz Lightyear setting up the tea party.
[00:27:19.116 --> 00:27:22.578]  And he's kind of homeless and he comes to the state like I'm Mrs. Nesbitt.
[00:27:22.818 --> 00:27:23.538]  You know what I mean?
[00:27:23.578 --> 00:27:26.099]  Was that what Ted Cruz was doing there?
[00:27:26.199 --> 00:27:27.960]  It's what they do, David.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.543]  Just like you guys recall, the recent governor race here in Texas is Wendy Davis and Greg Abbott.
[00:27:34.003 --> 00:27:36.404]  And Wendy Davis kept saying, you know, I'm very pro-gun.
[00:27:36.444 --> 00:27:38.085]  I'm very pro-open carry.
[00:27:38.125 --> 00:27:41.586]  And I'm like, well, when those guys were getting arrested right outside the Capitol, where were you?
[00:27:41.746 --> 00:27:41.907]  Yeah.
[00:27:43.207 --> 00:27:44.769]  It is not what they say, it's what they do.
[00:28:02.205 --> 00:28:07.086]  Who were exercising their right to open carry long weapons that were slung over their shoulders.
[00:28:07.586 --> 00:28:14.267]  And so we were standing up at the Alamo for our rights and meanwhile he's across the street playing Tea Party as Mrs. Nesbitt.
[00:28:14.387 --> 00:28:23.669]  Well that's just a testament to when he says that he's going to fight for the American people, meanwhile he's actually going to sit up with the establishment and have a tea party.
[00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:24.289]  And that's it.
[00:28:24.309 --> 00:28:28.670]  It's just they say one thing, they do another, their record shows as much.
[00:28:29.232 --> 00:28:33.314]  Well, and we've seen him reverse himself on so many different issues.
[00:28:33.334 --> 00:28:35.114]  He reversed himself on Ed Snowden now recently.
[00:28:35.154 --> 00:28:39.236]  He just reversed himself and said, we're not going to throw 12 million people out of the country.
[00:28:39.656 --> 00:28:42.958]  Now he's saying he's going to throw... Reminds me of Judge Cinderella and Martha.
[00:28:43.438 --> 00:28:46.039]  Too busy to deal with Supreme Court justices.
[00:28:46.479 --> 00:28:48.240]  Got that big-town Martha to deal with right there.
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:49.140]  Protocol was followed.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.661]  She's over there doing her local stuff.
[00:28:51.681 --> 00:28:53.282]  Doesn't have time to go take care of something like that.
[00:28:53.502 --> 00:29:04.149]  Well, you know, the New York Times is coming out and saying, if you, Republican Party, do, or I'm sorry, the Washington Post, you must do everything in your power to stop Donald Trump.
[00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:10.113]  And they say, you know, at this stage, even an extraordinary effort might fall, but we've all got to get together.
[00:29:10.153 --> 00:29:16.998]  So you see the Washington Post, you see the RNC establishment, like Reince Priebus, who thinks that they're joining a club.
[00:29:17.638 --> 00:29:24.323]  You see the GOP establishment, people like John Boehner and Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, all these people in the National Review, they all hate Trump.
[00:29:24.343 --> 00:29:30.807]  And you've got to look at this and say, wow, you know, that's an interesting array of people that I would like to really get back at.
[00:29:31.367 --> 00:29:32.208]  They hate him so much.
[00:29:32.528 --> 00:29:36.351]  And then they go on to say in the Washington Post, they call him a bullying demagogue.
[00:29:36.371 --> 00:29:37.992]  And it's like, OK, that's fair enough.
[00:29:38.732 --> 00:29:42.735]  But, okay, these guys are backstabbing demagogues, okay?
[00:29:42.795 --> 00:29:44.055]  That's what I see from Ted Cruz.
[00:29:44.075 --> 00:29:57.764]  He's a guy who'll come up to your face after he's looked at his little pocket calculator that has analyzed every aspect of your life, and he'll tell you precisely what he thinks you want to hear, and probably knows what you want to hear, and then as soon as you turn around he stabs you in the back.
[00:29:57.884 --> 00:30:01.806]  And that's the kind of backstabbing, lying demagogues that we've had.
[00:30:01.846 --> 00:30:03.207]  So yeah, okay, bullying demagogue.
[00:30:03.407 --> 00:30:04.748]  Well, we'll go with that for a while.
[00:30:04.768 --> 00:30:05.909]  At least he's honest about it.
[00:30:06.269 --> 00:30:15.417]  They had actual articles written of mathematicians calculating what it is with the structure of Cruz's face that makes people not trust him.
[00:30:15.717 --> 00:30:17.339]  He looks like Grandpa from Monsters.
[00:30:18.248 --> 00:30:22.649]  Like, what is it about his facial makeup that makes the American people just not trust him?
[00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:23.910]  They should have done that sooner.
[00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:26.211]  It's too late to apply for surgery.
[00:30:26.231 --> 00:30:29.512]  When I see him, when I hear him talk, I don't trust him.
[00:30:29.732 --> 00:30:32.873]  I feel like he's too much of a professional politician.
[00:30:33.513 --> 00:30:35.073]  Like you said, he's saying what people want to hear.
[00:30:35.093 --> 00:30:35.974]  He's playing on that.
[00:30:36.274 --> 00:30:39.035]  But then when it comes time to actually deal with something, do it.
[00:30:39.355 --> 00:30:40.095]  He's not going to do it.
[00:30:40.115 --> 00:30:40.395]  That's right.
[00:30:40.415 --> 00:30:41.936]  Let's talk about somebody else we can't trust.
[00:30:42.396 --> 00:30:42.856]  Fox News.
[00:30:43.416 --> 00:30:47.279]  We've got Rupert Murdoch attending a $2,700-a-plate fundraiser for Hillary Clinton.
[00:30:47.299 --> 00:30:55.105]  Now remember, this was back in August that he was saying, let's get a real billionaire we can trust, like Michael Bloomberg, the best mayor ever.
[00:30:55.185 --> 00:30:58.868]  The guy who wants to tell you how much soda pop you can have, wants to ban every gun in the country.
[00:30:59.488 --> 00:31:07.680]  So we've seen Rupert Murdoch begging Michael Bloomberg to get in the race back in August, now attending a $2,700 plate fundraiser for Hillary Clinton.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.724]  That's the most you can give as an individual to any candidate.
[00:31:10.764 --> 00:31:12.287]  So he's maxing out on his donation.
[00:31:12.647 --> 00:31:14.169]  And then you had Megyn Kelly.
[00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:27.063]  Megyn Kelly yesterday had a candidate forum, had all four of the other candidates except for Donald Trump at this candidate forum, and interestingly enough, I was thinking late this afternoon, I was like, I didn't hear anything about that last night.
[00:31:27.083 --> 00:31:35.152]  She had a two-hour forum with the four candidates, and so I started looking for news articles about it, and there's no news except for the fact that Donald Trump chose not to go.
[00:31:35.672 --> 00:31:35.872]  Right.
[00:31:35.932 --> 00:31:41.698]  I mean, nobody talked about anything that was said simply about the fact that Donald Trump stiffed Megyn Kelly.
[00:31:41.919 --> 00:31:46.884]  And of course, he had a one-hour interview by himself with Sean Hannity on Monday.
[00:31:47.264 --> 00:31:50.147]  And that's when we found the interesting news that Donald Trump
[00:31:50.748 --> 00:31:51.328]  He's already, sir.
[00:32:14.895 --> 00:32:15.635]  Hillary for prison.
[00:32:15.655 --> 00:32:20.198]  I'm going to get that tattooed across my back if he goes in and does what he says.
[00:32:20.218 --> 00:32:22.238]  And of course, you don't have to get that tattooed across your back.
[00:32:22.278 --> 00:32:25.900]  You can buy that at the InfoWars store and support our operation.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:26.260]  Yes.
[00:32:26.661 --> 00:32:27.621]  Or a limited time.
[00:32:27.661 --> 00:32:28.321]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:32:28.361 --> 00:32:29.202]  Without any pain.
[00:32:29.942 --> 00:32:33.404]  When we come back in the next segment, we're going to be talking to Richard Reeves.
[00:32:33.424 --> 00:32:38.686]  We'll be joining him live outside of the location of the debate in Houston, the University of Houston.
[00:32:38.706 --> 00:32:39.146]  Stay with us.
[00:32:39.467 --> 00:32:40.047]  We'll be right back.
[00:33:14.313 --> 00:33:16.794]  This is Bernie Sanders and I'm quite upset.
[00:33:16.975 --> 00:33:23.737]  If you guys saw the Iowa caucus the other night, you would know that I worked extremely hard for these votes.
[00:33:24.038 --> 00:33:30.200]  And the people that were working in the Iowa caucus took what I worked hard for and gave it to someone else.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:34.462]  A lying, cheating, horrible human being by the name of Hillary.
[00:33:34.462 --> 00:33:36.263]  Hillary Clinton!
[00:33:36.644 --> 00:33:41.587]  And I, I don't understand how anybody could like something like this.
[00:33:41.687 --> 00:33:53.936]  That you work hard for something your whole life and you earn something and then you're expected to give it to someone else who's not as deserving and is too lazy or more of a piece of crap than you are.
[00:33:54.076 --> 00:33:57.058]  What kind of person would even think about something like that?
[00:33:57.979 --> 00:34:00.681]  Hey, that'd be you Bernie Sanders.
[00:34:00.921 --> 00:34:01.901]  Guess you just felt the Bern.
[00:34:02.842 --> 00:34:06.123]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:06.283 --> 00:34:11.064]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[00:34:12.104 --> 00:34:13.745]  The knowledge of the ancients.
[00:34:14.065 --> 00:34:17.686]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[00:34:17.906 --> 00:34:20.507]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[00:34:20.827 --> 00:34:24.228]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:34:24.468 --> 00:34:29.129]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge
[00:34:29.209 --> 00:34:29.829]  We're good to go!
[00:34:57.529 --> 00:35:00.431]  With exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[00:35:00.811 --> 00:35:03.993]  Now is the time to secure Ancient Defense for you and your family.

[00:35:11.418 --> 00:35:18.162]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:35:18.182 --> 00:35:21.504]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:35:21.644 --> 00:35:22.305]  Here we go, folks!
[00:35:22.325 --> 00:35:23.225]  I'm being assaulted!
[00:35:23.285 --> 00:35:29.571]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:35:29.631 --> 00:35:35.616]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:35:35.696 --> 00:35:39.499]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:35:39.659 --> 00:35:42.501]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.tv is designed to do.
[00:35:42.601 --> 00:35:50.728]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:35:50.988 --> 00:35:53.050]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:54.151]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:35:54.512 --> 00:36:03.280]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[00:36:48.317 --> 00:37:08.361]  And let's dispel once and for all this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:37:08.401 --> 00:37:09.781]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:37:23.284 --> 00:37:27.526]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News live coverage of the GOP debate in Houston.
[00:37:28.026 --> 00:37:31.308]  We're going to join our reporter there who's live, Richard Reeves, in just a moment.
[00:37:31.328 --> 00:37:34.049]  I'm here with Leanne McAdoo and Joe Biggs and the rest of the crew.
[00:37:34.549 --> 00:37:38.851]  Let's go to Richard Reeves, our reporter who's right outside the location of the debate right now.
[00:37:38.891 --> 00:37:39.131]  Richard?
[00:37:42.292 --> 00:37:43.253]  Okay, they're still setting up.
[00:37:43.273 --> 00:37:43.373]  Okay.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:49.362]  Well, I'm curious as to why Ted Cruz has his hand under his pocket like this.
[00:37:50.583 --> 00:37:57.505]  Like you said, it's either a Canadian thing, or maybe his fingers are crossed and he's like, you know what, I'm about to screw all you guys over.
[00:37:57.646 --> 00:37:59.986]  I'm actually eligible for this election.
[00:38:00.027 --> 00:38:02.468]  We've got Richard ready, now let's go to Richard Reeves.
[00:38:02.508 --> 00:38:08.170]  Richard, quickly, because they're about to start the debate, give us a rundown on what you've seen outside the debate location.
[00:38:09.471 --> 00:38:16.534]  Well, David, right now what we've had is we've got the motley-est crew of protesters I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of protests over the years.
[00:38:17.175 --> 00:38:21.917]  And this crew rivals 2008 RNC in St.
[00:38:21.977 --> 00:38:30.361]  Paul, Minneapolis, that big RNC thing when you had a bunch of poo-flingers loading up their little baggies full of poo and flinging it.
[00:38:31.121 --> 00:38:34.304]  I see a costume character there in the background.
[00:38:34.424 --> 00:38:36.486]  Describe the rest of the people there.
[00:38:36.826 --> 00:38:39.769]  Looks like Marie Antoinette.
[00:38:40.449 --> 00:38:41.090]  It's unbelievable.
[00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:48.076]  It's so ironic because I think a Donald Trump presidency would actually help most of these people's pocketbooks, I think.
[00:38:49.678 --> 00:38:53.801]  It's a combination of Black Lives Matter, open borders,
[00:38:54.902 --> 00:38:57.685]  Uh, you know, pay us $15 an hour to flip a hamburger.
[00:38:57.925 --> 00:38:58.125]  Yeah.
[00:38:58.226 --> 00:39:00.688]  And just endless, yeah, totally just against GOP.
[00:39:00.708 --> 00:39:01.509]  We won't have any jobs.
[00:39:01.569 --> 00:39:04.752]  So, free health care, free, uh, free, free everything.
[00:39:04.812 --> 00:39:05.593]  Free college tuition.
[00:39:05.733 --> 00:39:08.476]  Well, they know there's not going to be any jobs once they graduate, so.
[00:39:09.591 --> 00:39:10.471]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[00:39:10.751 --> 00:39:14.893]  Maybe a robot will come along and groom their stool or something when they can't do anything else.
[00:39:15.513 --> 00:39:17.393]  Anyway, we've actually got an info warrior here.
[00:39:17.433 --> 00:39:18.174]  We've got Jason.
[00:39:18.714 --> 00:39:19.694]  He dropped by.
[00:39:19.734 --> 00:39:21.094]  He recognized our flag here.
[00:39:21.114 --> 00:39:21.655]  Hello, Jason.
[00:39:21.695 --> 00:39:22.095]  How you doing?
[00:39:22.175 --> 00:39:23.655]  I recognize your face, brother.
[00:39:23.755 --> 00:39:24.636]  I love you guys.
[00:39:25.276 --> 00:39:27.797]  So, Jason, what do you think about this motley crew?
[00:39:27.877 --> 00:39:29.937]  And more importantly, what do you think about tonight's debate?
[00:39:31.298 --> 00:39:35.539]  Well, this crew here, I was just watching for a minute, and I was just saddened.
[00:39:35.879 --> 00:39:38.800]  I was saddened by the ideas that they're promoting.
[00:39:39.733 --> 00:39:49.917]  And I used to have more judgment in my heart and disgust, but, you know, evolving through learning things, through getting deeper spiritually with the Lord, it's just difficult to see.
[00:39:50.957 --> 00:39:57.260]  And at the same time, I know my heart's still hard, and I want to be able to weep and wail with God for that, which is before our eyes in this generation.
[00:39:59.061 --> 00:39:59.681]  All right, Jason.
[00:40:00.161 --> 00:40:04.623]  Let's tell us a little bit about what you think about tonight's debate.
[00:40:05.865 --> 00:40:20.233]  I mean, you know, a lot of the things I hear on InfoWars Alex talk about as far as Trump maybe being the only hope here and that, you know, we're not 100% sure that he really stands for the people if everything that he says is legitimate.
[00:40:20.814 --> 00:40:22.295]  But I would have to agree as far as
[00:40:23.596 --> 00:40:24.737]  Hope for this nation.
[00:40:24.857 --> 00:40:32.381]  We do need a leader who will stand up and speak the truth, speak about the 28 pages, because it's God's will that we expose darkness.
[00:40:33.461 --> 00:40:42.106]  At the same time, we could have a person that has all the right intents, of all the right motivations, that really wants to represent the people and represent righteousness.
[00:40:42.646 --> 00:40:50.650]  But if us as a common man of this country doesn't repent and return to God, embrace His commandments, stop slaughtering the innocent,
[00:40:51.270 --> 00:41:02.159]  Come out of our churches because the churches are corrupt and God is speaking all these things to a true prophet at trumpetcallofgod.com So I hope that Trump, you know means what he says.
[00:41:02.179 --> 00:41:09.124]  I hope that he's true And I'm praying that we can turn around individually because we can all have an impact on
[00:41:09.384 --> 00:41:14.030]  Daniel in the Bible was just one man, but he had an impact to shake up nations and kingdoms.
[00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:17.053]  And God's calling his people forth to come out and to embrace him.
[00:41:17.474 --> 00:41:19.175]  So political activism is great.
[00:41:19.196 --> 00:41:20.777]  We've got to speak out on these things.
[00:41:21.038 --> 00:41:23.420]  But in our own hearts, we have to do work with the Lord.
[00:41:24.201 --> 00:41:26.324]  As for the debate, you know, I like
[00:41:27.024 --> 00:41:37.527]  Some of the things that Cruz says, but he's just got that vibe with me that doesn't sit well, and I don't want to judge my brother because he says to be a child of God, but at the same time you'll know them by their fruits.
[00:41:37.947 --> 00:41:46.770]  Well, one good thing about Cruz though is he talks a lot about the Constitution too, which I count him as a fellow info warrior as far as bringing more people to
[00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:58.775]  This uprising, to this movement, because I think, actually, I think if Trump and Cruz worked a little bit more together, I think we'd see 75-80% going anti-establishment right here.
[00:41:58.995 --> 00:42:02.576]  Richard, we're going to go back, the debate is about to start.
[00:42:03.757 --> 00:42:16.642]  We're going to join the debate because they're about to start with the first questions here, but I agree with what he was saying and I heard a pastor today saying, essentially, that so many times Christians have, they're wondering what's going on with the evangelical vote.
[00:42:17.122 --> 00:42:22.806]  And he said he believes that a lot of Christians are looking at this and saying, you know, we have tried to achieve this politically.
[00:42:23.286 --> 00:42:27.869]  Now we're just looking for somebody who can pragmatically run the country as a manager.
[00:42:28.169 --> 00:42:32.532]  And we understand that these spiritual issues are something we're going to have to take care of locally.
[00:42:32.632 --> 00:42:33.793]  I think that's a healthy idea.
[00:42:34.093 --> 00:42:39.776]  And I think it's a healthy thing for us to say we're going to fight for our liberties individually in our communities.
[00:42:39.916 --> 00:42:44.959]  Let's just try to make sure that we've got our borders taken care of, that we're not being destroyed and managed.
[00:42:45.059 --> 00:42:47.020]  Our economy is not going to be managed by foreign power.
[00:42:47.041 --> 00:42:49.822]  I think that's going to be a very important thing for us to do moving forward.
[00:42:50.002 --> 00:42:50.863]  Let's go to the debate now.
[00:42:50.883 --> 00:42:52.324]  We'll come back to you, Richard, in a few minutes.
[00:42:52.364 --> 00:42:52.844]  Thank you so much.
[00:42:52.884 --> 00:42:53.844]  Richard Reeves in Houston.
[00:42:53.864 --> 00:42:55.105]  Let's join the debate here.
[00:42:55.165 --> 00:42:56.146]  This is the first comment.
[00:42:56.166 --> 00:42:57.306]  They're introducing themselves.
[00:42:57.366 --> 00:43:01.309]  Who am I this week to you American people?
[00:43:05.836 --> 00:43:06.376]  Governor Kasich.
[00:43:06.396 --> 00:43:12.579]  Well, you know, on the way over here, even getting ready earlier, sitting in the green room and watching the early coverage.
[00:43:13.419 --> 00:43:15.400]  You know, my father... Now, what did Kasich say today?
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:18.321]  Well, he's giving you his canned speech.
[00:43:18.381 --> 00:43:21.743]  Let me tell you what he said kind of off the cuff earlier this week.
[00:43:21.763 --> 00:43:25.484]  Somebody asked him, they said, well, you know, are you going to live out your purpose?
[00:43:25.564 --> 00:43:26.665]  And Kasich said this, he said...
[00:43:27.225 --> 00:43:29.867]  Well, I don't know if my purpose is to be president.
[00:43:30.287 --> 00:43:32.989]  My purpose is to be out here doing what I think I need to be doing.
[00:43:33.009 --> 00:43:34.170]  We'll see where that ends up.
[00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:36.251]  And if it's not this crusade, it'll be another.
[00:43:36.291 --> 00:43:39.634]  And maybe it'll be a really small one, like somewhere in my kid's school.
[00:43:39.714 --> 00:43:42.716]  And it's like, yeah, that's kind of what the poll numbers are telling him.
[00:43:43.016 --> 00:43:48.860]  I think that he may be going back and crusading in his kid's school because I don't think he's going to make it too far in the presidential race.
[00:43:49.361 --> 00:43:49.581]  Yeah.
[00:43:52.222 --> 00:43:57.066]  And to convince everyone he's not part of the establishment and he's against the big banks and everything.
[00:43:57.647 --> 00:44:01.270]  I got my golden parachute and now I'm against it just like Hillary Clinton.
[00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:04.793]  I'm against big money in politics just as soon as I get elected.
[00:44:05.624 --> 00:44:08.186]  36 years ago, Ronald Reagan and George H.W.
[00:44:08.226 --> 00:44:09.988]  Bush began the Reagan Revolution.
[00:44:10.148 --> 00:44:16.092]  For a generation, they defined conservatism as limited government and free enterprise and a strong national defense.
[00:44:16.232 --> 00:44:17.593]  He'll talk about ISIS a lot, too.
[00:44:17.674 --> 00:44:20.736]  He loves to drop Reagan and ISIS names.
[00:44:20.756 --> 00:44:23.058]  That's just something you will see over and over again.
[00:44:23.138 --> 00:44:24.038]  It's under the programming.
[00:44:24.139 --> 00:44:27.081]  I think there's some foam party suds on his forehead.
[00:44:28.723 --> 00:44:34.029]  I just, I mean, even when you just look at him, there's no way that he's gonna stand up to ISIS.
[00:44:34.449 --> 00:44:36.291]  I just, you know, it's just not gonna happen.
[00:44:36.351 --> 00:44:37.072]  Sorry, Marco.
[00:44:37.092 --> 00:44:38.914]  I agree with everybody else.
[00:44:39.535 --> 00:44:40.576]  Go get some experience.
[00:44:44.449 --> 00:44:49.252]  It's interesting because the guys who are running as senators, they haven't even finished a single term yet.
[00:44:49.472 --> 00:44:52.914]  Ted Cruz has only finished about two-thirds of a single term.
[00:44:52.954 --> 00:44:56.397]  Here my mom became the first in our family ever to go to college.
[00:44:57.057 --> 00:45:03.641]  Here my dad fled Cuba and washed dishes making 50 cents an hour to pay his way through the University of Texas.
[00:45:04.262 --> 00:45:07.464]  I graduated from high school at Second Baptist, not too far away from here.
[00:45:08.104 --> 00:45:08.805]  He skipped over the Canada part.
[00:45:08.825 --> 00:45:09.405]  He forgot about that.
[00:45:09.445 --> 00:45:10.906]  And that's when I renounced my Canadian citizenship.
[00:45:10.926 --> 00:45:11.347]  Here's the thing.
[00:45:11.487 --> 00:45:14.229]  If he wants to appoint an originalist constitutionalist, Mike Scalia.
[00:45:30.161 --> 00:45:36.164]  If he wants to promote a Supreme Court judge like Scalia, then he should tell us why he's a natural born citizen, but he doesn't.
[00:45:36.524 --> 00:45:37.084]  Great again.
[00:45:37.564 --> 00:45:39.205]  We don't win anymore as a country.
[00:45:39.665 --> 00:45:40.826]  We don't win with trade.
[00:45:41.386 --> 00:45:42.787]  We don't win with the military.
[00:45:42.967 --> 00:45:44.788]  ISIS, we can't even knock out ISIS.
[00:45:44.928 --> 00:45:46.909]  And we will, believe me, we will.
[00:45:47.629 --> 00:45:50.150]  We don't win in any capacity with healthcare.
[00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:51.731]  We have terrible healthcare.
[00:45:51.991 --> 00:45:54.612]  Obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced.
[00:45:55.092 --> 00:45:56.653]  We just don't win.
[00:45:56.673 --> 00:45:57.673]  You look at our borders.
[00:45:57.833 --> 00:45:59.014]  They're like Swiss cheese.
[00:45:59.174 --> 00:46:00.194]  Everybody pours in.
[00:46:00.815 --> 00:46:02.275]  We're going to make a great country again.
[00:46:02.295 --> 00:46:03.816]  We're going to start winning again.
[00:46:03.836 --> 00:46:05.056]  We're going to win a lot.
[00:46:05.416 --> 00:46:06.757]  It's going to be a big difference.
[00:46:06.857 --> 00:46:07.337]  Believe me.
[00:46:07.377 --> 00:46:08.898]  It's going to be a big, big difference.
[00:46:11.889 --> 00:46:16.030]  Wow, he had some cheers there from the six students in attendance.
[00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:18.311]  It's now time to begin questions.
[00:46:18.411 --> 00:46:33.554]  Voters in the first four states have spoken and Mr. Trump has emerged as the frontrunner, but in five days the candidates will face their biggest test yet, Super Tuesday, when nearly half of the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination will be awarded.
[00:46:33.874 --> 00:46:37.475]  We're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back with the debate.
[00:46:37.495 --> 00:46:39.516]  We're going to be joining it and of course there's going to be
[00:46:40.276 --> 00:46:41.885]  This is going to be quite a debate tonight, I think.
[00:46:41.925 --> 00:46:42.407]  Stay with us.
[00:46:42.689 --> 00:46:43.232]  We'll be right back.
[00:47:00.899 --> 00:47:01.900]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.722]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:05.003 --> 00:47:12.850]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:13.635 --> 00:47:17.218]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:17.238 --> 00:47:19.600]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:23.483]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:23.543 --> 00:47:26.685]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:27.185 --> 00:47:32.009]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:34.391]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:47:34.731 --> 00:47:39.175]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:39.335 --> 00:47:41.356]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:41.977 --> 00:47:43.458]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:43.598 --> 00:47:43.738]  Exactly.
[00:47:43.758 --> 00:47:47.681]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:48.182 --> 00:47:56.228]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:06.092]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:06.352 --> 00:48:12.474]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:12.654 --> 00:48:19.636]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:19.976 --> 00:48:29.819]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:36.423]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:36.643 --> 00:48:39.325]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:39.725 --> 00:48:41.186]  And adenosylcobalamin.
[00:48:41.467 --> 00:48:44.809]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:48:45.069 --> 00:48:46.690]  No needles, no injections.
[00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:48.451]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:48:48.611 --> 00:48:49.672]  Try it for yourself.
[00:48:49.812 --> 00:48:50.813]  Discover the secret.
[00:48:51.053 --> 00:48:51.373]  Secret 12.

[00:49:00.179 --> 00:49:00.432]  We're good.
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.461]  Welcome back to our live coverage of the Houston debate.
[00:49:14.581 --> 00:49:18.262]  And as we were on break, they asked the first question about immigration.
[00:49:18.282 --> 00:49:20.723]  Will you expel the 11 million people?
[00:49:20.783 --> 00:49:25.385]  And Trump pointed out, we wouldn't even be talking about this in these terms if it wasn't for me.
[00:49:25.465 --> 00:49:26.325]  Let's go back to the debate.
[00:49:26.345 --> 00:49:31.947]  Ted mentioned Arizona because probably the toughest man on borders is Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
[00:49:32.027 --> 00:49:34.448]  And two days ago, he totally endorsed me.
[00:49:34.548 --> 00:49:35.829]  So, thank you.
[00:49:38.996 --> 00:49:48.242]  Senator Rubio, Senator Rubio, Senator Cruz has called your immigration plan amnesty and has an ad out there comparing it to President Obama's.
[00:49:48.502 --> 00:49:57.769]  He says both of you support allowing undocumented immigrants legal status here in the United States after a background check, paying a fine, and paying taxes.
[00:49:58.169 --> 00:49:59.550]  Are those claims correct?
[00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:07.877]  Well, first of all, before we do anything, and I've been abundantly clear on this, when I'm President of the United States, before we do anything on immigration, we are going to secure the border.
[00:50:07.937 --> 00:50:11.540]  And that's not just the physical border with Mexico, it's visa overstays.
[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:18.446]  Well, why'd you triple the amount of H-1B worker visas that the President was given and able to hand out?
[00:50:18.766 --> 00:50:19.547]  And that's not even the H-2B visas.
[00:50:19.567 --> 00:50:21.728]  And Donald mentioned, because he mentioned me in his answer,
[00:50:26.412 --> 00:50:27.493]  Is your plan Obama's plan?
[00:50:27.573 --> 00:50:28.554]  Thanks to me because I tripled
[00:50:52.176 --> 00:50:53.177]  Oh my gosh!
[00:50:53.197 --> 00:50:58.760]  He tripled the H-1B visas to allow these people to come in and take American jobs.
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:50:59.040]  Wow.
[00:50:59.401 --> 00:51:02.623]  Answer the question, Marco Rubio.
[00:51:02.643 --> 00:51:06.745]  Of course they're going to pay the fines because 90% skipped the court appearances.
[00:51:06.825 --> 00:51:07.326]  Right, yeah.
[00:51:07.426 --> 00:51:10.468]  Of course they're going to pay the fines.
[00:51:10.508 --> 00:51:13.850]  As soon as they get a job, one of your jobs is to pay for it.
[00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:17.612]  In the 1950s, they started moving people out and the rest of them left.
[00:51:17.953 --> 00:51:19.414]  Self-deportation, as I
[00:51:20.174 --> 00:51:24.778]  Really define it, and that's the way I define it, is you're gonna get some to go and the rest are gonna go out.
[00:51:25.118 --> 00:51:34.347]  As far as the people that I've hired in various parts of Florida during the absolute prime season, like Palm Beach and other locations, you could not get help.
[00:51:34.407 --> 00:51:35.348]  It's the up season.
[00:51:35.688 --> 00:51:37.570]  People didn't want to have part-time jobs.
[00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:41.633]  There were part-time jobs, very seasonal, 90 day jobs, 120 day jobs, and you couldn't get.
[00:51:43.895 --> 00:51:45.375]  Everybody agrees with me on that.
[00:51:45.696 --> 00:51:52.957]  They were part-time jobs you needed, or we just might as well close the doors because you couldn't get help in those hot, hot sections of Florida.
[00:51:54.318 --> 00:51:57.879]  My point that I made was that you had criticized Mitt Romney for self-deportation.
[00:51:57.919 --> 00:51:59.979]  You're trying to avoid the question that you were asked.
[00:51:59.999 --> 00:52:02.000]  Mitt Romney isn't running.
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.580]  How do the people in Florida feel?
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.401]  Politico said that Rubio is Romney 2.0, Rob.
[00:52:10.382 --> 00:52:27.518]  How do the people in Florida feel when all of their jobs went to their foreign replacements and people there in Disney they actually had someone testify today and cry about the fact that he had to train his replacement and that this is not
[00:52:28.938 --> 00:52:36.360]  And he's never going to end up answering that question.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.621]  He just went after Trump.
[00:52:37.641 --> 00:52:48.084]  He's going to flip all over this self-deportation, he's going to ignore amnesty, he's going to ignore his tripling of the H-1B visas, criticize somebody for using what he provided out there, and then focus on self-deportation.
[00:52:52.905 --> 00:53:02.914]  And you were, you were curious, you were, you were wondering would they actually talk about issues or would they just try to attack each other and that's obviously the tactic that he's been given tonight because he didn't answer.
[00:53:02.934 --> 00:53:05.216]  That was a great comeback.
[00:53:05.756 --> 00:53:07.218]  Okay, so he says, well you hired people.
[00:53:07.258 --> 00:53:09.580]  He goes, I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:10.841]  You haven't ever hired anybody.
[00:53:12.994 --> 00:53:14.755]  You've just given away people's jobs.
[00:53:14.775 --> 00:53:17.036]  Don't talk to me about how you managed your credit cards.
[00:53:17.056 --> 00:53:18.337]  Rubio's trying to put on his big boy pants.
[00:53:18.357 --> 00:53:18.897]  Not gonna happen.
[00:53:18.917 --> 00:53:21.098]  Somebody needs to tell him to go after the visas, man.
[00:53:37.285 --> 00:53:40.866]  And you're just so against it that you just fought so hard.
[00:53:40.926 --> 00:53:42.987]  He's smiling because he avoided the question.
[00:53:43.167 --> 00:53:44.747]  Triple the amount of visas.
[00:53:45.207 --> 00:53:46.228]  Keep a beak wide.
[00:53:46.248 --> 00:53:47.608]  Just speak wide.
[00:53:47.688 --> 00:53:48.228]  Let me talk.
[00:53:48.628 --> 00:53:50.709]  I've hired tens of thousands of people.
[00:53:51.289 --> 00:53:53.249]  He brings up something from 30 years ago.
[00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:54.750]  It worked out very well.
[00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:55.810]  Everybody was happy.
[00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:58.151]  And by the way, the laws were totally different.
[00:53:58.171 --> 00:53:58.491]  Look at him.
[00:53:58.511 --> 00:53:59.851]  He's like, I'm winning this debate.
[00:53:59.871 --> 00:54:01.091]  But I've hired people.
[00:54:01.451 --> 00:54:03.432]  Nobody up here has hired... Senator Cruz.
[00:54:04.867 --> 00:54:08.749]  Why doesn't Trump say, hey, you should answer the question?
[00:54:08.789 --> 00:54:17.054]  I guess they're not going to press him on answering the question.
[00:54:17.114 --> 00:54:20.475]  Maybe their parents would take them with them.
[00:54:20.616 --> 00:54:23.057]  Yeah, this is what's happening in Rubio's state right here.
[00:54:23.197 --> 00:54:26.419]  Pink slips at Disney, but train your foreign replacements first.
[00:54:26.519 --> 00:54:30.421]  I don't understand this whole thing about, what about the children who are left behind?
[00:54:30.881 --> 00:54:34.223]  What kind of a parent would leave their kids behind if they were getting deported?
[00:54:34.423 --> 00:54:35.343]  I don't understand that.
[00:54:35.403 --> 00:54:43.167]  I mean, if I went somewhere, and I was violating the law going there, and I took my child there, or had children there, and they deported me, I would take my children with me.
[00:54:43.187 --> 00:54:48.649]  Some of the same parents that are sending their kids over in trains, and they're dying trying to come across the border, they're not even coming with them.
[00:54:49.289 --> 00:54:49.449]  Yeah.
[00:54:49.469 --> 00:54:49.609]  Yeah.
[00:54:55.126 --> 00:54:56.807]  And indeed, if you look at the Gang of Eight.
[00:54:57.167 --> 00:54:58.568]  A very successful show.
[00:54:59.228 --> 00:54:59.928]  It was huge.
[00:55:00.449 --> 00:55:04.991]  Broke his promise to the men and women who elected him and wrote the amnesty bill.
[00:55:05.831 --> 00:55:07.932]  But Donald funded the Gang of Eight.
[00:55:08.052 --> 00:55:10.113]  See, it's all about attacking Donald.
[00:55:10.133 --> 00:55:21.598]  Hey, by the way guys, don't forget, I'm waiting on the edge of my seat here because remember they're saying that there's supposed to be a huge scandal about Donald Trump that's supposed to break sometime this week.
[00:55:21.939 --> 00:55:24.720]  Mitt Romney has been going around all week on... He had something with his tax records.
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:25.641]  Exactly.
[00:55:25.681 --> 00:55:43.554]  Mitt Romney said that it was bombshell information we had earlier this week on the Alex Jones Show as political strategist and Trump insider Roger Stone who said that he thought the establishment Republicans were going to make up some BS story about Trump cheating on his taxes or maybe saying that he is married to the mob.
[00:55:44.395 --> 00:55:47.278]  Well, and of course, they didn't make up anything, what he did.
[00:55:47.298 --> 00:55:57.547]  One of the reasons, I think, that you saw Donald Trump going after Romney, criticizing him for being a loser, running a bad campaign, is because Romney just threw out a lot of baseless innuendo.
[00:55:57.607 --> 00:55:58.447]  Well, I don't know.
[00:55:58.487 --> 00:55:59.548]  It could be this, it could be that.
[00:55:59.588 --> 00:56:00.129]  We'll have to see.
[00:56:00.189 --> 00:56:02.371]  But, you know, there's something there because he's not putting...
[00:56:02.611 --> 00:56:08.013]  People were begging Romney for a couple of months to release his tax returns before he finally did.
[00:56:08.433 --> 00:56:16.497]  And of course... And I've said it before, you gotta be careful when you attack Trump, because that what doesn't kill him only makes him stronger, so it could come and backfire on him big time.
[00:56:16.557 --> 00:56:20.278]  And he's already admitted, he's a billionaire, he's paid off all the politicians.
[00:56:20.438 --> 00:56:21.399]  Right.
[00:56:21.419 --> 00:56:31.483]  I mean... You don't have one Republican... You don't have one Republican Senator and you work with them every day of your life, although you skipped a lot of time, these are minor details.
[00:56:33.047 --> 00:56:35.229]  One Republican Senator backing you.
[00:56:35.309 --> 00:56:35.809]  Not one.
[00:56:35.849 --> 00:56:40.212]  You don't have the endorsement of one Republican Senator and you work with these people.
[00:56:40.232 --> 00:56:40.712]  Senator Cruz.
[00:56:40.952 --> 00:56:41.713]  Him and Rubio.
[00:56:47.031 --> 00:56:50.973]  He is promising if he's elected he will go and cut deals in Washington, and he's right.
[00:56:51.333 --> 00:56:55.375]  He has supported, he has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats.
[00:56:55.395 --> 00:57:00.477]  Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be hiring illegal immigrants.
[00:57:00.537 --> 00:57:07.520]  Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be funding Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi, wouldn't be funding the Gang of Eight.
[00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:09.160]  And, you know, he is right.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:14.583]  Anybody who really supported the Constitution, Ted, wouldn't be running when they're not eligible to either.
[00:57:14.603 --> 00:57:15.443]  That's the whole thing.
[00:57:15.963 --> 00:57:19.467]  That's what his former Harvard professor said.
[00:57:19.587 --> 00:57:22.369]  So the kind of judge at a point would say that you're not qualified.
[00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:24.251]  Because they read the Constitution.
[00:57:25.472 --> 00:57:30.177]  It is easy for him to say, oh, you would do this if you really... but he hasn't hired anyone.
[00:57:30.617 --> 00:57:35.121]  And if he was a smart business person, he, like the rest of the corporate world, would be...
[00:57:35.902 --> 00:57:36.842]  Iron people for cheap.
[00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:57.071]  You can respond, but let me get Governor Kasich in.
[00:57:57.091 --> 00:57:58.032]  He's been waiting patiently.
[00:57:58.692 --> 00:57:59.793]  Governor Kasich.
[00:57:59.933 --> 00:58:07.256]  He does have 3 or 4% of the polls, so we should give him a chance to respond to something at some point in the future.
[00:58:07.376 --> 00:58:08.437]  And he's from Ohio.
[00:58:08.777 --> 00:58:12.879]  Should people be allowed to break the law just because it's not feasible?
[00:58:13.159 --> 00:58:16.841]  And one of the polls that I just saw shows him losing in his own state.
[00:58:17.714 --> 00:58:19.196]  Why do you cry?
[00:58:39.115 --> 00:58:40.776]  Look, I think there is an answer here.
[00:58:41.337 --> 00:58:49.261]  The answer is you complete the border, you let people... Okay, so John Kasich is getting very nostalgic about those halcyon days of the Bush administration.
[00:58:49.862 --> 00:58:51.663]  We're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back.
[00:58:51.723 --> 00:58:52.123]  Stay with us.
[00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:02.291]  Knockout is back.
[00:59:02.611 --> 00:59:13.718]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[00:59:14.118 --> 00:59:15.819]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:16.299 --> 00:59:17.020]  L-Theanine.
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:25.425]  Hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:59:25.825 --> 00:59:27.586]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:59:28.167 --> 00:59:32.549]  It's the same price as leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece.
[00:59:33.010 --> 00:59:38.653]  It has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult, and it just synergistically puts everything in there.

[01:00:04.004 --> 01:00:07.805]  And let's dispel once and for all the suspicion that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing.
[01:00:07.845 --> 01:00:09.106]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[01:00:22.722 --> 01:00:24.403]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:00:24.443 --> 01:00:26.004]  Live coverage of the GOP debate.
[01:00:26.044 --> 01:00:28.925]  The final GOP debate before the Super Tuesday election.
[01:00:29.005 --> 01:00:30.066]  Five days away.
[01:00:30.426 --> 01:00:32.427]  Let's return back to the debate.
[01:00:32.647 --> 01:00:32.887]  Some audio.
[01:00:32.907 --> 01:00:34.608]  We've got Ben Carson to tell you a question.
[01:00:34.908 --> 01:00:36.889]  I'll just tell those who are watching our broadcast.
[01:00:37.149 --> 01:00:41.231]  From here on out, we'll be synchronizing with the station breaks that CNN had.
[01:00:41.291 --> 01:00:45.053]  We had some hard breaks that we need to do for our network sponsors in this first hour.
[01:00:45.073 --> 01:00:46.153]  Let's go back to Ben Carson.
[01:00:46.674 --> 01:00:48.074]  They have to pay a back-tax penalty.
[01:00:48.094 --> 01:00:49.575]  They have to pay taxes going forward.
[01:00:49.595 --> 01:00:51.376]  But they don't have to live underground anymore.
[01:00:52.268 --> 01:00:57.531]  And I think they do not become American citizens, they do not vote.
[01:00:57.871 --> 01:01:02.854]  If they want to become an American citizen, they go through exactly the same process that anybody else goes through.
[01:01:03.375 --> 01:01:06.416]  I think that's the kind of situation that is actually fair to people.
[01:01:06.817 --> 01:01:12.540]  And we have other ways of utilizing our facilities and our talents as foreign aid.
[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:21.285]  Doing things in South America and Central America and Mexico that improve the economy there so that they don't feel the need to come over here.
[01:01:21.465 --> 01:01:23.066]  How about ending the war on drugs?
[01:01:23.086 --> 01:01:24.286]  Would that improve the economy?
[01:01:24.326 --> 01:01:25.606]  Would that stop the violence?
[01:01:26.146 --> 01:01:30.528]  And maybe we can improve our economy here by getting rid of the welfare entitlement state.
[01:01:30.788 --> 01:01:31.288]  Right.
[01:01:31.448 --> 01:01:39.831]  So those two issues, the welfare entitlement state and the war on drugs, are both a magnet to bring people in as well as to import crime into our country.
[01:01:39.851 --> 01:01:43.192]  But we're not going to touch those because those are untouchable programs.
[01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:45.072]  They make the government stronger.
[01:01:45.112 --> 01:01:47.293]  They don't work for the people, but they make the government stronger.
[01:01:47.313 --> 01:01:49.114]  The war on drugs, the welfare state.
[01:01:50.114 --> 01:01:54.562]  The last two presidents of Mexico say that will never happen.
[01:01:54.622 --> 01:02:00.932]  In fact, the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox, he said today, and I'm quoting him... Do it for your host country!
[01:02:01.353 --> 01:02:02.975]  Vote for your host country.
[01:02:04.056 --> 01:02:08.420]  That's no pasara for you, uh, Spanish speakers out there.
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.041]  No pasara.
[01:02:10.081 --> 01:02:10.621]  Yeah.
[01:02:10.681 --> 01:02:11.222]  Yeah.
[01:02:11.242 --> 01:02:17.086]  He's not appealing to Hispanics that he's angry with for voting for Trump.
[01:02:17.126 --> 01:02:20.649]  Okay, I'm not saying this is about race, but, you know, do it for your host country.
[01:02:20.709 --> 01:02:22.611]  If it's a host country, you don't have to worry.
[01:02:24.992 --> 01:02:27.234]  I was talking to some college students yesterday.
[01:02:27.254 --> 01:02:30.936]  I was talking to some college students yesterday at the University of Texas.
[01:02:31.217 --> 01:02:35.900]  And this guy's like, I asked him, I said, if you could tell Donald Trump right now anything, what would it be?
[01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:38.702]  I said, look into the camera, be completely honest.
[01:02:39.082 --> 01:02:40.824]  He goes, well, I think he's racist.
[01:02:41.104 --> 01:02:42.085]  And I go, well, why is that?
[01:02:42.105 --> 01:02:45.307]  He goes, well, he wants to build a wall between us and Mexico.
[01:02:45.667 --> 01:02:48.469]  I said, hey, buddy, you know there's a wall in southern Mexico?
[01:02:48.489 --> 01:02:49.030]  Yeah.
[01:02:49.110 --> 01:02:49.250]  No.
[01:02:50.010 --> 01:02:50.971]  It's already there!
[01:02:50.991 --> 01:02:51.972]  It's just not completed!
[01:02:51.992 --> 01:02:54.294]  I said to one of those Hispanics, I was like, are they all racist too?
[01:02:54.354 --> 01:02:56.496]  Are you calling Hispanic people Mexicans racist?
[01:02:56.556 --> 01:02:57.937]  Oh no, no, no, no!
[01:02:57.957 --> 01:02:59.358]  And I was like, well, I was like, guess what?
[01:02:59.518 --> 01:03:01.780]  The Vatican, there's a wall there too.
[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:03.281]  Is the Pope racist too?
[01:03:03.601 --> 01:03:04.902]  And he's kind of started backpedaling.
[01:03:05.082 --> 01:03:06.083]  Yeah, you gotta shut him down.
[01:03:06.123 --> 01:03:07.424]  So many uneducated people out there.
[01:03:07.524 --> 01:03:08.005]  So many.
[01:03:08.025 --> 01:03:13.669]  And as soon as you just put a little fax... The Mexican president has a feeling that they need to vote on a basis of race as well.
[01:03:13.769 --> 01:03:16.872]  Hey, forget about Trump's plan.
[01:03:17.052 --> 01:03:19.094]  Let's talk about Trump's clan.
[01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:28.533]  This was from Nevada, they were going around saying that Klan members support Trump, but this hand, look at the color of this hand.
[01:03:28.933 --> 01:03:29.413]  I can't see it.
[01:03:29.433 --> 01:03:30.433]  He's a tan Klan.
[01:03:30.453 --> 01:03:34.474]  It's a Black Lives Matter dressed up like a, it's a tan Klan.
[01:03:34.494 --> 01:03:37.534]  Oh, controlled opposition or agent provocateur.
[01:03:37.594 --> 01:03:45.196]  Today it was trending on Twitter that everybody was talking on Twitter about how David Duke came out and said that people need to support Donald Trump.
[01:03:45.476 --> 01:03:47.536]  Really, you can't stop anyone who endorses you.
[01:03:48.076 --> 01:03:49.477]  I can endorse someone right now.
[01:03:49.517 --> 01:03:51.197]  It wouldn't matter.
[01:03:51.377 --> 01:03:52.538]  You're voting for him.
[01:03:52.558 --> 01:03:54.939]  You're not voting for the people that endorse him.
[01:03:55.119 --> 01:03:56.279]  That's the most ridiculous thing.
[01:03:56.299 --> 01:04:00.441]  I always get pissed off when I hear people go, oh, well, this person endorsed him.
[01:04:00.461 --> 01:04:01.321]  What are you going to say about that?
[01:04:01.601 --> 01:04:02.781]  Who cares?
[01:04:03.022 --> 01:04:06.823]  And it's no secret that he is slowly but surely winning over the black vote.
[01:04:07.523 --> 01:04:08.624]  That's a fact.
[01:04:08.884 --> 01:04:09.624]  I don't mind trading.
[01:04:10.151 --> 01:04:13.072]  He just said something important.
[01:04:13.132 --> 01:04:16.393]  I don't mind going into a trade war where we're losing 58 billion dollars.
[01:04:16.413 --> 01:04:24.195]  When I did that report talking about shipping containers, it's like if we've got ships that are routinely coming here the size of the Empire State Building.
[01:04:24.235 --> 01:04:25.696]  That's the size of that ship.
[01:04:25.736 --> 01:04:28.797]  Coming over here fully laden, going back completely empty.
[01:04:29.277 --> 01:04:31.558]  Why are we worried about free trade?
[01:04:31.578 --> 01:04:34.378]  There is no trade happening.
[01:04:34.619 --> 01:04:34.999]  Exactly.
[01:04:35.059 --> 01:04:36.819]  We don't have any trade under that system.
[01:04:37.699 --> 01:04:39.080]  Why are we worried about maintaining that?
[01:04:41.535 --> 01:04:43.921]  I wish we could have gotten some, like, footage of this.
[01:04:47.473 --> 01:04:49.235]  Such a cute soundbite.
[01:04:49.315 --> 01:04:51.897]  And I guarantee they're going to turn down jobs.
[01:04:52.097 --> 01:04:54.679]  No, no one's going to turn down a job in this economy.
[01:04:54.959 --> 01:04:57.601]  Global recession coming.
[01:04:57.842 --> 01:05:05.548]  So you're going to be starting a trade war against your own ties and suits.
[01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:07.529]  Against your own ties and suits.
[01:05:07.569 --> 01:05:09.831]  Let us not worry about this myth about Polish workers.
[01:05:09.911 --> 01:05:13.614]  Once again, they're trying to come after the capitalists.
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.801]  There's a theory that Donald Trump hired Polish workers.
[01:05:18.101 --> 01:05:26.363]  There's a theory out there.
[01:05:27.244 --> 01:05:33.265]  Ask him if he understands the China price, Trump.
[01:05:33.726 --> 01:05:34.906]  Oh my gosh.
[01:05:34.986 --> 01:05:39.067]  Yeah, but you know about massive credit card debt, not paying it off.
[01:05:39.187 --> 01:05:39.807]  Phone parties.
[01:05:40.007 --> 01:05:41.688]  Yeah, he knows about personal bankruptcy.
[01:05:41.788 --> 01:05:44.389]  Let me tell you my personal experience about bankruptcy.
[01:05:47.317 --> 01:05:48.738]  Oh, this is getting ridiculous.
[01:05:48.818 --> 01:05:50.498]  It's just like attack each other.
[01:05:50.518 --> 01:05:54.980]  He's throwing out a little bit of a smear that he can find anywhere.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.701]  They said they were going to attack Trump, send the establishment after Trump.
[01:06:00.081 --> 01:06:01.202]  Here we are.
[01:06:01.362 --> 01:06:05.983]  Interestingly enough, Cruz is waiting and letting the two of them go after each other.
[01:06:06.003 --> 01:06:07.844]  Here's the guy.
[01:06:10.865 --> 01:06:11.605]  Here's the guy.
[01:06:12.415 --> 01:06:15.077]  That's because Cruz likes to bathe in blood.
[01:06:15.117 --> 01:06:20.962]  He sells it to a lobbyist who's probably here for $380,000 and then legislation is passed.
[01:06:21.382 --> 01:06:22.823]  You tell me about this guy.
[01:06:23.064 --> 01:06:24.545]  This is what we're going to have as president.
[01:06:24.565 --> 01:06:25.706]  Here's a guy that inherited $200 million.
[01:06:25.886 --> 01:06:29.008]  If he hadn't inherited $200 million, you know we're Donald Trump.
[01:06:29.048 --> 01:06:29.929]  That's not a crime.
[01:06:30.189 --> 01:06:30.469]  No.
[01:06:31.610 --> 01:06:39.276]  Inheriting money isn't a crime, but grabbing his money and selling it to, and getting paid off by a lobbyist, laundering it through your house sale, that would be a crime.
[01:06:39.296 --> 01:06:39.777]  That's the point.
[01:06:40.017 --> 01:06:41.319]  Oh, okay.
[01:06:41.379 --> 01:06:42.380]  One million dollars.
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:45.584]  Then release the tax return so he can see how much money he made.
[01:06:45.604 --> 01:06:46.605]  Well, he doesn't make that much money.
[01:06:46.685 --> 01:06:47.666]  One million dollars.
[01:06:55.936 --> 01:07:04.579]  First day in office, you will get rid of President Obama's executive action known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA for short.
[01:07:05.199 --> 01:07:12.341]  It is a program that has protected hundreds of thousands of young people that came here when they were children brought to the U.S.
[01:07:12.421 --> 01:07:13.842]  by undocumented immigrants.
[01:07:13.862 --> 01:07:15.542]  Up to the age of 31, let's talk about children.
[01:07:15.562 --> 01:07:16.823]  Right, not children.
[01:07:16.963 --> 01:07:17.523]  Up to the age of 31.
[01:07:17.843 --> 01:07:20.784]  And there's also a Deferred Action for Parents, DAPA.
[01:07:20.804 --> 01:07:24.445]  Remember the Pope situation, the kid running out there?
[01:07:24.845 --> 01:07:26.226]  You're going to send my parents away?
[01:07:26.327 --> 01:07:27.908]  It's like, no, your parents can take you.
[01:07:27.948 --> 01:07:29.429]  They can actually be parents.
[01:07:29.489 --> 01:07:33.193]  Which translates to DACA is going to have to end at some point.
[01:07:33.713 --> 01:07:36.516]  But it wouldn't be fair to cancel it immediately.
[01:07:37.330 --> 01:07:40.932]  By the way, guys, you know, I'd like to keep track of the mainstream media.
[01:07:40.972 --> 01:07:48.617]  Last night on Bill O'Reilly, they were talking about Donald Trump and his immigration policy as far as sending the immigrants back.
[01:07:48.637 --> 01:07:58.703]  And, you know, they kept showing images of children and just in the arrest and it was it was a very sad, sad, you know.
[01:07:58.723 --> 01:08:06.748]  Presumably with teddy bears, Darren, you know, like maybe the teddy bears that Glenn Beck met them with at the border, you know.
[01:08:07.629 --> 01:08:08.630]  Seriously, I mean, he did it.
[01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:09.951]  I found it with teddy bears.
[01:08:10.852 --> 01:08:18.000]  Because, you know, these kids go from Central America all the way through Mexico, eight years old, on their own, and they need a teddy bear at the end of that rough road.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:21.844]  Yeah, one of those teddy bears found a gun and shot a woman.
[01:08:23.464 --> 01:08:30.309]  Well, it's no wonder that conservatives are jumping ship and no longer paying attention to Fox News like they used to.
[01:08:30.449 --> 01:08:33.611]  They can no longer trust them.
[01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:39.295]  Well, I agree here where he's saying it's unconstitutional and that's why he said he's going to repeal it.
[01:08:39.415 --> 01:08:43.337]  And she's saying, but the children, the children, it's not fair.
[01:08:43.417 --> 01:08:50.442]  And it's just, that's what's causing even now record numbers of children to come across the border without their parents.
[01:08:52.859 --> 01:08:55.101]  Nobody complains about the parents doing that, though.
[01:08:56.001 --> 01:09:01.425]  Nobody complains about the actual children who are sent over with mules.
[01:09:01.485 --> 01:09:01.985]  Traffickers.
[01:09:02.045 --> 01:09:03.867]  Child traffickers.
[01:09:04.507 --> 01:09:07.349]  And there's only one candidate that talks about anchor babies.
[01:09:07.609 --> 01:09:08.910]  That's right.
[01:09:09.090 --> 01:09:10.711]  That's right.
[01:09:11.212 --> 01:09:13.473]  Because it is not true that I'm not going to get rid of DACA.
[01:09:13.513 --> 01:09:14.514]  I am going to get rid of DACA.
[01:09:14.554 --> 01:09:17.096]  In the Spanish interview, you just read out the transcript in Spanish.
[01:09:17.176 --> 01:09:19.217]  I said it will have to end at some point.
[01:09:19.277 --> 01:09:21.879]  That point will be when I eliminate the executive order.
[01:09:22.259 --> 01:09:26.162]  And the people who have those permits, when they expire, will not be allowed to renew it.
[01:09:26.622 --> 01:09:28.304]  And new people will not be able to apply.
[01:09:28.364 --> 01:09:31.766]  In fact, I don't even think we should be taking new enrollees in the program now.
[01:09:32.146 --> 01:09:34.368]  That is how the program ends and how you wind it down.
[01:09:34.708 --> 01:09:36.109]  Is you allow the people who are on it.
[01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:39.432]  When the program expires, they cannot renew it and it goes away.
[01:09:39.692 --> 01:09:44.195]  But I will cancel the executive order as soon as I step foot into the Oval Office.
[01:09:44.355 --> 01:09:45.216]  Yeah, we believe you.
[01:09:45.236 --> 01:09:47.338]  Just like when you ran for Senate.
[01:09:48.098 --> 01:09:48.738]  A hundred percent.
[01:09:48.758 --> 01:09:50.759]  Senator, are you lying about the Polish workers?
[01:09:50.839 --> 01:09:51.119]  No.
[01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:54.000]  You lied to their students at Trump University?
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:56.361]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:09:56.441 --> 01:09:57.682]  And he constantly cuts in.
[01:09:57.742 --> 01:09:58.442]  He doesn't allow it.
[01:09:58.462 --> 01:10:00.062]  As soon as Trump starts to talk.
[01:10:00.643 --> 01:10:01.683]  And no one tells him.
[01:10:02.363 --> 01:10:04.444]  Nobody asks you a question, Rubio.
[01:10:05.224 --> 01:10:07.465]  Look, he's fired up.
[01:10:07.485 --> 01:10:08.806]  Bumped up tonight.
[01:10:09.046 --> 01:10:12.467]  And you're right that Senator Rubio called me a liar for saying that.
[01:10:13.226 --> 01:10:23.993]  You know, we've all seen at home when Washington politicians say about an illegal or unconstitutional program, well it'll have to end someday, not immediately, but someday in the future.
[01:10:24.774 --> 01:10:27.615]  That inevitably is when a politician doesn't plan to end it at all.
[01:10:27.655 --> 01:10:31.038]  You know, I'm reminded of that that is the same position.
[01:10:33.423 --> 01:10:34.224]  Yeah.
[01:10:34.865 --> 01:10:44.853]  When I campaigned in Iowa and took on the lobbyists, took on the corporate welfare and said we should have no ethanol subsidies, Marco's position was the same as it is towards illegal amnesty.
[01:10:44.893 --> 01:10:47.115]  Well, someday it should end, just not now.
[01:10:47.896 --> 01:10:55.383]  And frankly, I think we need a president who knows what he believes and is willing to say it on day one, not at the end of his term when it's somebody else's problem.
[01:10:55.783 --> 01:10:58.065]  That's not an accurate assessment of what I said about ethanol.
[01:10:58.085 --> 01:10:59.507]  What I said is ethanol will phase out.
[01:10:59.547 --> 01:11:00.808]  It is phasing out now.
[01:11:00.888 --> 01:11:06.253]  By 2022, that program expires by virtue of the existing law, and at that point, it will go away.
[01:11:06.373 --> 01:11:15.201]  I don't agree with the mandate and the program that's in place, but I think it's unfair that these people have gone out and invested all this money into this program, and we're just going to yank it away from them.
[01:11:15.241 --> 01:11:17.363]  And again, you want to think that Obama's on the right track.
[01:11:17.383 --> 01:11:19.325]  He's exactly what he's doing, right?
[01:11:19.825 --> 01:11:22.106]  So I wasn't telling the truth, or was I?
[01:11:22.146 --> 01:11:23.486]  I wasn't a candidate for president?
[01:11:23.746 --> 01:11:24.347]  And I'm president?
[01:11:24.367 --> 01:11:26.127]  I've got a whole new set of promises.
[01:11:44.358 --> 01:11:45.138]  He's got that right.
[01:11:45.238 --> 01:11:46.659]  Yeah, I can't argue with that.
[01:11:47.039 --> 01:11:48.280]  This is where he needs to put that line.
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:48.660]  Come on.
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:53.262]  Let's dispense once and for all the notion that Obama doesn't know what he's doing.
[01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:54.442]  Perfect place for it.
[01:11:54.462 --> 01:11:54.742]  He's lost it.
[01:11:54.762 --> 01:11:54.922]  Canadian.
[01:12:02.955 --> 01:12:03.596]  Yeah, Canadian.
[01:12:04.656 --> 01:12:05.777]  First Canadian, Hispanic.
[01:12:06.458 --> 01:12:08.960]  Well, what was your line about the Keystone Pipeline?
[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:09.540]  Accubating.
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:12.943]  Yeah, like the Keystone Pipeline, Ted Cruz runs from Canada to Texas.
[01:12:13.544 --> 01:12:19.869]  Actually, Trump would figure that out.
[01:12:19.889 --> 01:12:20.609]  Pretty funny.
[01:12:20.629 --> 01:12:27.555]  The majority of Republicans, so my question to you is, are you missing a huge opportunity to expand the Republican base?
[01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:30.141]  Well, Maria, listen, you are right.
[01:12:30.201 --> 01:12:35.843]  It is extraordinary that out of five people standing on this stage, that two of us are the children of Cuban immigrants.
[01:12:35.903 --> 01:12:40.405]  It really is an embodiment... And not eligible under the Constitution run for the office of President.
[01:12:40.465 --> 01:12:42.506]  Let's talk about natural-born citizens, Ted.
[01:12:42.566 --> 01:12:48.828]  Please explain to us, as someone who is a lawyer who argued before the Supreme Court, would you have the decency to make the case somewhere?
[01:12:49.148 --> 01:12:53.390]  Maybe not in the debate because it's too complicated for you, but at least on your website.
[01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:55.191]  Tell us why you are eligible.
[01:12:56.297 --> 01:12:58.160]  Well, he's dispelling the notion that you have to be liberal if you're Hispanic.
[01:13:07.253 --> 01:13:18.059]  Yeah, I can't believe that nobody has asked the candidates whether or not they intend to disclose the 28 pages of the redacted pages of the 9-11 commission report.
[01:13:18.079 --> 01:13:21.641]  I think the whole media would be complicit though if they do.
[01:13:21.721 --> 01:13:26.023]  Oh, I can tell you Darren, nobody from Trump will even acknowledge that they exist.
[01:13:26.263 --> 01:13:28.344]  Remember the response of Jed?
[01:13:29.124 --> 01:13:30.525]  What?
[01:13:30.545 --> 01:13:30.985]  You got him?
[01:13:32.246 --> 01:13:33.247]  Infowars.com?
[01:13:33.607 --> 01:13:34.867]  Sounds like a powerful group.
[01:13:36.048 --> 01:13:37.329]  Yeah, more powerful than Jeb right now.
[01:13:37.349 --> 01:13:39.150]  Yeah, it's not just about getting here and being able to stay here.
[01:13:39.190 --> 01:13:40.451]  It's, is this country going to keep working?
[01:13:58.522 --> 01:13:59.283]  You know what?
[01:13:59.943 --> 01:14:05.047]  I'm kind of sick of people like this Telemundo person who's like, tell me what you're going to do for Hispanics.
[01:14:05.087 --> 01:14:07.309]  It's like, you know, stop the division.
[01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:16.557]  It shouldn't be about this hyphenated version of America that the media sells us all the time because they want to divide and balkanize this country.
[01:14:16.977 --> 01:14:20.820]  I am sick of Telemundo and the rest of these people who want to come out.
[01:14:20.901 --> 01:14:22.402]  You know, they're trying to create a race war.
[01:14:23.022 --> 01:14:26.904]  You already know what Telemundo's gonna ask as soon as they step up to the platform.
[01:14:26.965 --> 01:14:27.965]  I mean, you know what they're gonna ask.
[01:14:27.985 --> 01:14:29.146]  You know what question they're gonna ask.
[01:14:29.186 --> 01:14:29.586]  Exactly.
[01:14:29.646 --> 01:14:31.967]  Tell me about, you know, Hispanics or whatever.
[01:14:32.027 --> 01:14:35.890]  No, talk about what's in the interest of the American people.
[01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:37.391]  The American people.
[01:14:37.771 --> 01:14:39.192]  Hispanic and everybody.
[01:14:39.292 --> 01:14:44.735]  And that's why the majority of Hispanics in Nevada voted for Donald Trump.
[01:14:44.835 --> 01:14:46.757]  He wasn't playing this divide-and-conquer stuff.
[01:14:46.777 --> 01:14:51.921]  They were voting in the best interest of America, not for what this Mexican president was talking about in Colombo.
[01:14:51.941 --> 01:14:59.527]  Most of the Hispanic people that we talk to here in Austin, the people that we meet every day, they don't want America to become Mexico.
[01:14:59.547 --> 01:15:00.187]  That's right.
[01:15:00.227 --> 01:15:01.228]  They left Mexico.
[01:15:02.069 --> 01:15:02.829]  They left Mexico.
[01:15:02.849 --> 01:15:04.911]  There's a lot of people fleeing all these different countries.
[01:15:04.931 --> 01:15:06.252]  They're going, yeah, we want a border.
[01:15:06.492 --> 01:15:07.693]  We didn't have one back home.
[01:15:07.953 --> 01:15:09.074]  That's why it's gone to hell.
[01:15:09.294 --> 01:15:11.536]  So yeah, we agree with Donald Trump on that aspect.
[01:15:11.596 --> 01:15:13.477]  Well, and it's not just Mexico.
[01:15:13.557 --> 01:15:21.882]  It's a lot of the other countries as well that Mexico is trying to seal off their southern border from people coming up from these other countries in Central America.
[01:15:21.922 --> 01:15:24.163]  That they're trying to seal their border.
[01:15:24.944 --> 01:15:28.586]  So, you know, I hate to say it's just about Mexico because it's not.
[01:15:28.746 --> 01:15:29.587]  Absolutely.
[01:15:29.867 --> 01:15:34.212]  Every question from this Telemundo person is about Hispanic this.
[01:15:34.252 --> 01:15:35.172]  Hispanic that.
[01:15:35.253 --> 01:15:36.974]  You know, we're in this as Americans, okay?
[01:15:36.994 --> 01:15:38.236]  And it's just like the Mexican president.
[01:15:47.705 --> 01:15:49.846]  Well, it's the same thing with Cesar Chavez.
[01:15:50.506 --> 01:15:51.626]  That was his thing.
[01:15:51.666 --> 01:15:53.227]  You can't have an open border.
[01:15:53.287 --> 01:15:56.648]  You can't have a lot of people coming in that are going to take your jobs.
[01:15:56.968 --> 01:16:06.450]  He was fighting for the farmers' rights and workers' rights, saying this is not going to be good for the Hispanic population to have these open borders like this.
[01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:08.651]  And I don't know how that history got lost.
[01:16:09.251 --> 01:16:09.451]  Yeah.
[01:16:09.511 --> 01:16:09.811]  Racist.
[01:16:09.912 --> 01:16:14.634]  It's like he just got out of a clown costume and started, like, hurried up trying to get the makeup off.
[01:16:14.714 --> 01:16:16.175]  It brings the eyes out.
[01:16:16.395 --> 01:16:16.515]  Thanks.
[01:16:16.535 --> 01:16:17.015]  That's true.
[01:16:17.035 --> 01:16:17.115]  Yeah.
[01:16:17.135 --> 01:16:18.456]  That's what I did.
[01:16:18.516 --> 01:16:19.556]  I was governor of Ohio.
[01:16:19.576 --> 01:16:20.157]  It wasn't Jack Kemp.
[01:16:20.237 --> 01:16:20.857]  It was Jack Kennedy.
[01:16:39.099 --> 01:16:41.362]  I think they like me, and I appreciate that.
[01:16:41.382 --> 01:16:48.711]  I want them to have a safe opportunity that I and my children and my wife and the people we love have had in this country.
[01:16:49.092 --> 01:16:50.594]  It's time to solve problems.
[01:16:51.134 --> 01:16:56.782]  Dr. Farson, concerning this recommendation of the report, are you as a candidate getting it?
[01:16:57.839 --> 01:16:59.220]  I didn't hear the first part of the question.
[01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:09.369]  The first part of the question is, there was a report that recommended that in order to approach Hispanics and bring them to vote for the Republican Party, certain things needed to happen.
[01:17:09.589 --> 01:17:13.712]  And one of them was that they shouldn't feel like they were going to get kicked out of the United States.
[01:17:13.732 --> 01:17:14.193]  Well, you know what?
[01:17:14.213 --> 01:17:20.218]  Let's try to focus on whether it's the Republican Party or maybe it's going to be some party that replaces the Republican Party if they play games at this convention.
[01:17:20.458 --> 01:17:22.060]  Let's create a party that's about America.
[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:23.861]  That puts America's interests first.
[01:17:24.182 --> 01:17:28.306]  And then when the Hispanics want to be part of America, they'll be joining that party.
[01:17:29.066 --> 01:17:30.808]  We can call it the Libertarian Party.
[01:17:31.128 --> 01:17:34.251]  That's what I've always... And not just the country that's hosting you.
[01:17:35.112 --> 01:17:36.754]  That'd be a good name for it.
[01:17:36.794 --> 01:17:42.619]  Shouldn't you be catering to these people by telling them they don't have to be afraid of being deported?
[01:17:42.659 --> 01:17:44.802]  We need to have policies that are
[01:17:46.024 --> 01:17:48.586]  That give liberty and justice to all people.
[01:17:49.086 --> 01:17:52.948]  And that's the way that I have... I'm starting to fall asleep.
[01:17:52.988 --> 01:17:55.930]  Liberty and justice to all.
[01:17:56.991 --> 01:17:57.831]  I'm getting tired.
[01:17:58.331 --> 01:17:59.572]  Ben Carson must be talking.
[01:17:59.592 --> 01:18:05.596]  Oh, say can you see... Pull out random clothes.
[01:18:05.616 --> 01:18:08.878]  By the bombs early light, I can... This is what we need right now.
[01:18:11.104 --> 01:18:11.604]  You know what's funny?
[01:18:11.644 --> 01:18:14.966]  I've seen Ben Carson in interviews and he's a lot more animated.
[01:18:15.507 --> 01:18:17.408]  He's horrible at these debates.
[01:18:17.468 --> 01:18:18.289]  Yeah, he really is.
[01:18:18.309 --> 01:18:23.152]  I've seen him really come across well on television.
[01:18:23.432 --> 01:18:24.733]  The debates aren't working for him.
[01:18:25.733 --> 01:18:27.254]  It's gotta be a hard situation.
[01:18:27.274 --> 01:18:28.635]  It's gotta be a hard thing.
[01:18:28.835 --> 01:18:30.857]  I definitely don't mind him sticking around.
[01:18:31.664 --> 01:18:33.726]  You won the Hispanic vote in Nevada.
[01:18:34.186 --> 01:18:34.446]  True.
[01:18:34.826 --> 01:18:45.094]  But a brand new Telemundo poll says that three out of six states that vote nationwide have a negative opinion of you.
[01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:48.916]  Well, you know, NBC had a poll showing him losing to Ted Cruz.
[01:18:49.477 --> 01:18:51.798]  You know, polls say all kinds of stuff.
[01:18:51.838 --> 01:18:53.720]  And you can push these polls wherever you want.
[01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:54.540]  Yeah.
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:55.681]  Here's a new poll.
[01:18:55.781 --> 01:18:57.582]  I just... That's great.
[01:18:57.883 --> 01:18:59.003]  I don't believe it.
[01:18:59.243 --> 01:19:00.644]  Just shove it right down his throat.
[01:19:00.664 --> 01:19:01.225]  That's great.
[01:19:01.425 --> 01:19:06.909]  I currently employ thousands of Hispanics, and over the years I've employed tens of thousands of Hispanics.
[01:19:06.949 --> 01:19:07.530]  Number one.
[01:19:07.710 --> 01:19:08.330]  Number two.
[01:19:08.691 --> 01:19:13.354]  They know, and the reason I won in Nevada, not only won the big one, but I also won... Wow, they put up a new poll.
[01:19:13.374 --> 01:19:14.715]  They don't say a new Telemundo poll.
[01:19:14.795 --> 01:19:15.216]  Yeah.
[01:19:15.316 --> 01:19:18.518]  I love how these guys keep saying about these polls, just like you said, David.
[01:19:18.558 --> 01:19:20.180]  Like, they can get a poll from anywhere.
[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:22.962]  They go out, you know, ask five people in their base.
[01:19:23.242 --> 01:19:27.165]  You know, Obama goes to the White House, asks, you know, five people in the kitchen, do you agree with my policy?
[01:19:27.225 --> 01:19:28.566]  Oh yeah, we agree with your policy.
[01:19:28.586 --> 01:19:29.647]  Then they get their numbers.
[01:19:29.867 --> 01:19:30.327]  That's right.
[01:19:30.407 --> 01:19:31.508]  It's completely ridiculous.
[01:19:31.528 --> 01:19:36.891]  Yeah, of course, you know, the Telemundo viewers may skew to the pundits' point of view.
[01:19:37.152 --> 01:19:38.512]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:38.713 --> 01:19:39.913]  Exactly.
[01:19:40.273 --> 01:19:46.477]  I'm going to be bringing a lot of people in who are Democrats, who are Independents, and you're seeing that with the polls.
[01:19:46.878 --> 01:19:48.879]  You're actually seeing that with the elections.
[01:19:48.939 --> 01:19:53.782]  You're seeing that the number of votes that he's won are way ahead of where they were a few years ago.
[01:19:53.822 --> 01:19:55.423]  As a matter of fact, we have those stats here.
[01:19:56.103 --> 01:19:56.664]  Mitt Romney,
[01:19:57.424 --> 01:20:00.692]  Won Nevada's caucus with 50% of the vote, but he only got 16,000 votes.
[01:20:00.712 --> 01:20:01.374]  Trump got 34,500.
[01:20:04.048 --> 01:20:06.570]  Okay, with his 45 or whatever.
[01:20:06.610 --> 01:20:09.433]  Trump now has 420,000 votes at this point in time.
[01:20:09.453 --> 01:20:13.896]  Mitt Romney in 2012, when he won the nomination, only had 311,000 votes.
[01:20:13.956 --> 01:20:16.458]  So he's got 30% or better votes.
[01:20:16.899 --> 01:20:18.880]  Back in 2008, John McCain won.
[01:20:19.361 --> 01:20:21.783]  At this point, he had 250,000 votes.
[01:20:21.803 --> 01:20:25.446]  So Trump has nearly twice the number of votes that John McCain had.
[01:20:25.546 --> 01:20:29.950]  And he's getting this because they're getting record turnouts, just like record number of people watching these debates.
[01:20:30.986 --> 01:20:31.567]  I love them.
[01:20:31.707 --> 01:20:32.887]  I love them.
[01:20:32.967 --> 01:20:36.689]  Hey, well this isn't a poll, but what about that political science professor?
[01:20:36.909 --> 01:20:43.573]  He has a statistical model that accurately predicted Clinton, Bush, and Obama victories.
[01:20:43.633 --> 01:20:44.514]  Have you seen this guy?
[01:20:44.534 --> 01:20:45.234]  No, I didn't see that.
[01:20:45.274 --> 01:20:45.574]  Yes.
[01:20:45.794 --> 01:20:52.838]  And he says that there is a 97 to 99 percent chance of Donald Trump becoming the next president.
[01:20:52.878 --> 01:20:58.121]  Yeah, 97 percent chance against Bernie Sanders, 99 against, or no, 97 percent chance against
[01:20:59.682 --> 01:21:03.443]  Hillary Clinton 99% against Bernie Sanders.
[01:21:03.483 --> 01:21:14.927]  Plus too, I mean, just because someone has a negative opinion about them doesn't mean they're not like, you know, we've said this about Trump, like, well, I mean, he's what you call a bully demagogue.
[01:21:14.967 --> 01:21:15.847]  I agree with that, but.
[01:21:16.127 --> 01:21:16.827]  Yeah.
[01:21:17.047 --> 01:21:22.530]  Boy, you got a bully Hispanic reporter here who thinks it's her job to debate him.
[01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:30.234]  And so narrowly focused that she doesn't care anything about what's happening in this country except from a Hispanic perspective.
[01:21:30.254 --> 01:21:36.157]  I know so many African-American, Hispanic, Arab people who are going to vote for Trump.
[01:21:36.257 --> 01:21:41.279]  Quite a few students yesterday at UT that were Arab and Hispanic said, yeah, we're going to vote for Trump.
[01:21:41.299 --> 01:21:41.800]  Go Trump.
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:42.300]  Trump trained.
[01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:42.780]  Yeah.
[01:22:00.043 --> 01:22:02.926]  Who are out there who aren't going to come over and actually be an American?
[01:22:03.087 --> 01:22:04.508]  You don't even know what to talk about.
[01:22:04.689 --> 01:22:08.693]  Until you've been over there and seen what's going on in Europe, you have no idea.
[01:22:08.894 --> 01:22:14.060]  You're just being played by Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders with their BS rhetoric non-stop.
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:15.281]  They're pretty ridiculous.
[01:22:19.666 --> 01:22:22.629]  Justice Scalia was someone I knew personally for 20 years.
[01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:25.252]  Was privileged to be at his funeral this weekend.
[01:22:25.272 --> 01:22:26.993]  Did a little hunting together.
[01:22:27.013 --> 01:22:27.954]  Judge Napolitano.
[01:22:28.315 --> 01:22:29.255]  Hanging in the balance.
[01:22:29.275 --> 01:22:43.489]  This is going to be interesting because people have said that Ted Cruz really needs to recuse himself from being a part of the Senate Judiciary Committee or even for voting for a possible nominee because if he wins, they will be deciding whether or not he is a natural born citizen.
[01:22:44.129 --> 01:22:48.851]  You know what?
[01:22:50.512 --> 01:22:56.014]  We shouldn't have a president who would allow the Supreme Court to erase the Second Amendment.
[01:22:56.214 --> 01:22:57.754]  That's not in the Constitution, Ted.
[01:22:58.134 --> 01:22:59.035]  Shut up about that.
[01:22:59.255 --> 01:23:05.997]  If you don't have a backbone where you can stand up as an executive to the Supreme Court when they try to take away the Constitution, you shouldn't be running.
[01:23:06.017 --> 01:23:07.258]  Of course, you're not eligible anyway.
[01:23:08.358 --> 01:23:15.286]  I'm sick and tired of the demagoguery and I'm sick and tired of presidents who roll over and play dead when the Supreme Court makes an eating.
[01:23:15.447 --> 01:23:18.150]  That's not how you modify the Constitution.
[01:23:18.170 --> 01:23:19.051]  He ought to know that.
[01:23:19.111 --> 01:23:25.639]  But of course, he voted to get rid of the process for ratifying treaties before he voted against it.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.922]  He also said that he would vote to end the Fed and he didn't show up when his vote was counted.
[01:23:32.962 --> 01:23:33.562]  That's right.
[01:23:33.642 --> 01:23:34.643]  Talk is cheap.
[01:23:34.683 --> 01:23:35.783]  Talk is cheap, my friend.
[01:23:35.823 --> 01:23:38.384]  He does that double vote so he can say, well, I've evolved.
[01:23:38.564 --> 01:23:41.805]  He was too busy being a jerk to me in a city north of Charleston that night.
[01:23:43.223 --> 01:23:47.166]  And let's talk about how fruitless it has been for Supreme Court justices.
[01:23:47.706 --> 01:23:50.728]  Reagan appointed Scalia, who was consistent with his voter base.
[01:23:51.088 --> 01:23:56.492]  He appointed Sandra Day O'Connor, who was diametrically opposed to what his voter base wanted.
[01:23:56.913 --> 01:24:01.516]  And then he appointed Kennedy, who says we ought to determine things by international law.
[01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:02.496]  So he's all over the map.
[01:24:02.797 --> 01:24:03.657]  That was Ronald Reagan.
[01:24:04.278 --> 01:24:06.899]  Same thing with the Bushes.
[01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:08.901]  They will lose their tax exemption.
[01:24:09.401 --> 01:24:18.427]  Will you commit to voters tonight that religious liberty will be an absolute litmus test for anyone you appoint, not just to the Supreme Court, but to all courts?
[01:24:18.567 --> 01:24:20.148]  How about just the Constitution?
[01:24:20.769 --> 01:24:27.073]  Just so you guys know, in about 10 minutes I'm going to be in there where McBrain's at doing a Facebook mention, so I'll take over for about 5 minutes.
[01:24:27.653 --> 01:24:30.615]  And then you guys can pop in any time if there's anything juicy.
[01:24:30.655 --> 01:24:34.138]  So I'll be on in about 5-10 minutes and then that's going to be it, but I'll be in there where McBrain's at in about 10 minutes.
[01:24:34.158 --> 01:24:35.038]  He might mention I'm coming up.
[01:24:35.879 --> 01:24:35.959]  Okay.
[01:24:35.979 --> 01:24:40.000]  Interestingly enough, we all believe here and many other people do as well that Roberts was blackmailed.
[01:24:56.366 --> 01:25:02.752]  Chief Justice Roberts wrote both the consenting and the dissenting opinions on Obamacare.
[01:25:02.792 --> 01:25:03.873]  He's on both sides of the issue.
[01:25:04.133 --> 01:25:04.974]  He wrote both of them.
[01:25:05.134 --> 01:25:06.495]  That's unprecedented.
[01:25:06.515 --> 01:25:12.040]  And then he changes his vote at the last minute and says that the government can mandate us under the Constitution.
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:17.005]  Where do you find the basis for mandating that we buy something from a private company?
[01:25:17.025 --> 01:25:18.386]  You want to talk about eminent domain?
[01:25:18.726 --> 01:25:20.308]  Let's talk about making people slaves.
[01:25:20.988 --> 01:25:28.671]  I wonder, I wonder if the whole point of having Scalia go to this ranch was so they could get dirt on him like they did Roberts.
[01:25:28.691 --> 01:25:28.991]  Right.
[01:25:29.031 --> 01:25:29.691]  You know?
[01:25:29.711 --> 01:25:30.732]  Blackmailing him for that.
[01:25:30.892 --> 01:25:31.192]  Yeah.
[01:25:31.332 --> 01:25:34.433]  We're gonna have Alex Jones, he's gonna be joining us in just a few minutes as well.
[01:25:34.453 --> 01:25:34.974]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:25:40.162 --> 01:25:40.922]  Who's giving you money?
[01:25:40.962 --> 01:25:41.323]  Ted Cruz.
[01:25:41.343 --> 01:25:42.443]  That's what I'm thinking.
[01:26:00.313 --> 01:26:06.056]  I mean, everybody up there has got a lot to hide.
[01:26:06.096 --> 01:26:11.799]  So he's saying he's going to defend the Constitution faithfully, Mr. Cruz?
[01:26:11.839 --> 01:26:12.119]  Yeah.
[01:26:12.339 --> 01:26:17.882]  Just as long as they decide he's eligible to be president under the Constitution.
[01:26:17.902 --> 01:26:20.083]  Qualification is job one under the Constitution.
[01:26:20.103 --> 01:26:26.626]  If you don't respect it when it conflicts with your personal ambitions, then you're not going to respect the Constitution later for any other reason.
[01:26:26.646 --> 01:26:28.327]  Cruising around the Constitution.
[01:26:29.487 --> 01:26:31.509]  It's a good new segment.
[01:26:31.609 --> 01:26:32.529]  It's a good new t-shirt.
[01:27:00.729 --> 01:27:05.374]  Let me tell you right now, Donald, I will not apologize for a minute for defending the Constitution.
[01:27:05.435 --> 01:27:06.356]  I will not apologize.
[01:27:06.656 --> 01:27:07.457]  No, that's not what it is.
[01:27:08.258 --> 01:27:09.219]  I won't apologize.
[01:27:09.259 --> 01:27:15.627]  They've got their buzzwords for this election, so they've got to mention the Constitution, Reagan, anti-establishment.
[01:27:15.747 --> 01:27:16.027]  ISIS.
[01:27:16.127 --> 01:27:17.809]  And never answer a question.
[01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.969]  Attack Trump.
[01:27:32.617 --> 01:27:34.479]  And he knows he can cut a deal with him.
[01:27:34.519 --> 01:27:35.360]  You know what, Donald?
[01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:40.826]  I don't want us to bring court justice that you cut a deal with Harry Reid to undermine religious liberty.
[01:27:40.846 --> 01:27:41.848]  Nope, neither do I.
[01:27:41.948 --> 01:27:44.731]  ...will also erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.
[01:27:44.791 --> 01:27:48.195]  When you say crazy zealot, are you talking about you, crazy zealot?
[01:27:48.735 --> 01:27:49.456]  Give me a break.
[01:27:50.598 --> 01:27:52.439]  You've heard this exchange on religious liberty.
[01:27:52.639 --> 01:28:01.204]  You have said that religious liberty will trump even the ability of people to stay away from same-sex marriages, not provide flowers, etc.
[01:28:01.244 --> 01:28:03.845]  Are you satisfied with this exchange on religious liberty?
[01:28:04.425 --> 01:28:09.928]  Well, I think you ask a very important question because the issue here about the next President of the United States has to fill this vacancy.
[01:28:09.968 --> 01:28:10.829]  Justice Scalia
[01:28:11.841 --> 01:28:13.062]  Answer the question.
[01:28:13.082 --> 01:28:14.202]  We know that the next president... Robot.
[01:28:14.242 --> 01:28:14.502]  Robot.
[01:28:14.542 --> 01:28:14.842]  Robot.
[01:28:15.443 --> 01:28:15.703]  Robot.
[01:28:15.723 --> 01:28:16.043]  Robot.
[01:28:16.103 --> 01:28:16.223]  Robot.
[01:28:16.243 --> 01:28:16.563]  Robot.
[01:28:16.583 --> 01:28:16.763]  Robot.
[01:28:16.823 --> 01:28:20.065]  He doesn't want to jump in there because then he's going to offend his gay friends.
[01:28:27.188 --> 01:28:31.871]  He won't be invited to any more phone parties.
[01:28:31.911 --> 01:28:35.713]  He comes in and defends religious liberty.
[01:28:35.773 --> 01:28:37.314]  What would you do?
[01:28:38.015 --> 01:28:42.037]  Is someone keeping a tally of how many questions Marco Rubio has not answered?
[01:28:42.057 --> 01:28:44.459]  They all choose not to answer questions.
[01:28:45.299 --> 01:28:52.407]  He asked him, you know, if he's going to make a litmus test on a political issue and he doesn't answer that, he just attacks Trump.
[01:28:52.447 --> 01:28:55.711]  That's what we need to tweet out right now, Darren.
[01:28:55.751 --> 01:28:58.474]  How many questions has he ducked and dodged?
[01:29:02.498 --> 01:29:04.320]  Robots do not answer questions.
[01:29:04.641 --> 01:29:06.823]  I must not answer.
[01:29:06.944 --> 01:29:08.065]  He's like the G.I.
[01:29:08.205 --> 01:29:13.331]  Joe with the little doll, like the little button.
[01:29:13.351 --> 01:29:15.013]  He only has a few things he knows how to say.
[01:29:15.154 --> 01:29:18.878]  And eventually when you push the button too much, it just goes right back to him and he cycles.
[01:29:18.978 --> 01:29:21.762]  And you gotta cycle through to get the response you want.
[01:29:22.182 --> 01:29:24.966]  Strong, conservative, more importantly, he was a great president.
[01:29:25.187 --> 01:29:25.948]  A great president.
[01:29:26.308 --> 01:29:28.952]  As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, I'm pro-life.
[01:29:29.112 --> 01:29:31.035]  This shows you why Kasich and Carson shouldn't even be there.
[01:29:31.055 --> 01:29:31.736]  They don't jump in.
[01:29:31.756 --> 01:29:32.317]  They don't butt in.
[01:29:32.337 --> 01:29:33.899]  They don't make themselves heard.
[01:29:33.919 --> 01:29:35.722]  There's really no point for them.
[01:29:35.802 --> 01:29:36.904]  It should be these three right now.
[01:29:37.284 --> 01:29:40.585]  Well, you know that 3% number that Planned Parenthood always talks about comes from Planned Parenthood.
[01:29:40.625 --> 01:29:42.146]  You really don't know what the number is.
[01:30:05.856 --> 01:30:08.157]  They're a very trustworthy organization, Jakari Jackson.
[01:30:08.197 --> 01:30:09.338]  How dare you don't be racist?
[01:30:10.038 --> 01:30:15.241]  And of course, any money that you give them, you don't know how that's going to be... And what percentage of your corporation is killing people?
[01:30:15.261 --> 01:30:15.241]  1%?
[01:30:16.041 --> 01:30:17.842]  Alright, we're going to go with that.
[01:30:17.862 --> 01:30:26.866]  1% for... Yeah, I mean, the thing that they fail to realize, even if it is 3%, which I'm skeptical of, the majority of people who protest outside of those facilities are doing it because of abortion.
[01:30:27.047 --> 01:30:27.187]  Yeah.
[01:30:27.227 --> 01:30:27.447]  Right.
[01:30:28.411 --> 01:30:38.159]  You know, I saw him protest in the last three days at the Planned Parenthood Clinic that we had the communist, I guess, what do we have, the communist mini-battle?
[01:30:38.179 --> 01:30:40.080]  The communist devil worshipper freak out.
[01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:40.821]  The Red Guard.
[01:30:40.861 --> 01:30:44.324]  But there's still, like, anti-abortion people protesting out there every day.
[01:30:44.384 --> 01:30:45.044]  They're praying.
[01:30:45.064 --> 01:30:45.825]  Yeah, those mindless zombies.
[01:30:45.845 --> 01:30:49.408]  Those mindless zombies are out there arguing about abortion and their direct reflection of pro-life.
[01:30:56.724 --> 01:30:59.145]  Hey Jakari, do you miss the green-skinned communists?
[01:30:59.785 --> 01:31:00.445]  Devil worshippers?
[01:31:00.465 --> 01:31:02.526]  That was an interesting day.
[01:31:02.546 --> 01:31:03.366]  The dumpster jumper.
[01:31:04.307 --> 01:31:11.449]  I never would have expected that guys would come slithering over trash cans with Stalin and Lenin tattoos.
[01:31:11.469 --> 01:31:15.291]  And you know, trying to push old guys out into the street and then acting like they're tough.
[01:31:15.811 --> 01:31:17.392]  People in wheelchairs.
[01:31:17.412 --> 01:31:18.833]  You had to protect somebody in a wheelchair, right?
[01:31:18.994 --> 01:31:24.138]  Yeah, they tried to push Ronnie Rieferseed, a local activist, you know, a guy who's not in the best of health.
[01:31:24.158 --> 01:31:25.198]  They pushed him out in the street.
[01:31:25.499 --> 01:31:26.840]  They were yelling at David's wife.
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:28.801]  And that's an extremely busy road, too.
[01:31:28.821 --> 01:31:31.163]  Yeah, just acting like complete goons.
[01:31:31.403 --> 01:31:35.226]  They were calling David's wife a white savior because she didn't want to kill her kid.
[01:31:35.246 --> 01:31:39.169]  We ought to play one of the excerpts of the Devil Worshipping Comedy.
[01:31:39.249 --> 01:31:40.530]  I kill my babies.
[01:31:40.651 --> 01:31:41.451]  I kill my kids.
[01:31:41.511 --> 01:31:42.132]  Or the shorter one.
[01:31:42.152 --> 01:31:42.392]  What is it?
[01:31:42.412 --> 01:31:43.172]  The Abortion Team?
[01:31:45.234 --> 01:31:45.895]  Who put that together?
[01:31:45.915 --> 01:31:46.815]  Was that Ja'Kari McBreen?
[01:31:47.015 --> 01:31:48.476]  Ja'Kari, that was a great piece, Ja'Kari.
[01:31:48.516 --> 01:31:48.957]  Oh, thank you.
[01:31:49.197 --> 01:31:52.059]  Ja'Kari's very talented, but one of the things he's really good at is editing videos.
[01:31:52.299 --> 01:31:53.419]  He almost has McBreen built.
[01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:56.682]  But we ought to cut to McBreen for a minute, too.
[01:31:56.702 --> 01:31:57.802]  I know Kasich's talking.
[01:31:58.503 --> 01:31:59.323]  Now Carson's talking.
[01:31:59.343 --> 01:32:01.385]  After we talk to Carson, we'll go back to McBreen.
[01:32:01.405 --> 01:32:05.227]  I'm going to go in there in McBreen's area and give some analysis as well of what I've seen so far.
[01:32:05.247 --> 01:32:06.148]  But back to the crew.
[01:32:07.458 --> 01:32:13.542]  And it gives people who believe in same-sex marriage the same rights as everybody else.
[01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:19.906]  But what we have to remember is even though everybody has the same rights, nobody gets extra rights.
[01:32:20.346 --> 01:32:26.049]  So nobody gets to redefine things for everybody else and have them have to conform to it.
[01:32:26.129 --> 01:32:27.010]  That's unfair.
[01:32:27.530 --> 01:32:30.472]  And this is the responsibility... He's about to go for that pyramid.
[01:32:30.512 --> 01:32:31.793]  He's about to do the Illuminati symbol.
[01:32:32.253 --> 01:32:32.633]  That's right.
[01:32:47.418 --> 01:32:56.006]  He came the closest to getting the right answer, in my opinion, because he said that's why we have divided government, divided responsibility in the central government.
[01:32:56.026 --> 01:32:59.009]  It's because the Supreme Court has a certain jurisdiction.
[01:32:59.309 --> 01:33:03.232]  The president, the legislature, of course the Constitution tells everybody what they can do.
[01:33:03.493 --> 01:33:04.574]  But they exceeded their authority.
[01:33:05.094 --> 01:33:08.177]  And you didn't hear Mr. Cruz say that.
[01:33:08.337 --> 01:33:13.341]  Instead, what he's fear-mongering about is saying, well, you got a bad Supreme Court justice in there, there goes the Second Amendment.
[01:33:13.361 --> 01:33:14.261]  It's like, no.
[01:33:14.321 --> 01:33:22.168]  As a matter of fact, you shouldn't allow them to legislate from the bench when it comes to even homosexual marriage.
[01:33:22.468 --> 01:33:24.630]  That should be done at the state level.
[01:33:24.670 --> 01:33:27.932]  There's no authority in the Constitution for the Supreme Court to do that.
[01:33:28.092 --> 01:33:29.073]  Ted Cruz doesn't say that.
[01:33:29.393 --> 01:33:30.494]  Mr. Constitution.
[01:33:30.554 --> 01:33:32.436]  Yeah, Mr. Constitution, I'll fight for.
[01:33:32.970 --> 01:33:35.551]  That's why I wish Carson came across a little bit better because he does have
[01:33:53.119 --> 01:33:56.382]  I think that's why he speaks so slowly is because he has deep thoughts.
[01:33:56.402 --> 01:33:57.943]  Are you worried that President Trump would not repeal Obamacare?
[01:33:57.963 --> 01:34:00.064]  Why don't they just ask him, what would you do to repeal Obamacare?
[01:34:00.084 --> 01:34:01.625]  Right, it's not about, well, it's about Barack Trump.
[01:34:01.645 --> 01:34:02.846]  Every question has to tie back into Trump.
[01:34:03.146 --> 01:34:03.566]  That's right.
[01:34:41.488 --> 01:34:42.569]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:34:42.749 --> 01:34:44.450]  Don't do what the people want.
[01:34:44.490 --> 01:34:45.490]  Do what we want.
[01:34:45.530 --> 01:34:47.451]  You're not running for president.
[01:34:47.471 --> 01:34:50.493]  You're running for Arthur.
[01:34:50.733 --> 01:34:51.974]  I think we need it.
[01:34:52.114 --> 01:34:53.195]  I think it's a modern age.
[01:34:53.455 --> 01:34:54.535]  And I think we have to have it.
[01:34:55.256 --> 01:34:57.217]  Okay, so let's talk about pre-existing conditions.
[01:34:58.371 --> 01:35:11.811]  What the insurance companies say is that the only way that they can cover people is to have a mandate requiring everybody... But they don't get to do that because the insurance companies don't get to dictate what our Constitution says.
[01:35:11.931 --> 01:35:14.715]  Oh, unless they can blackmail a Supreme Court justice.
[01:35:14.975 --> 01:35:17.836]  Then the insurance companies can change the Constitution.
[01:35:17.936 --> 01:35:25.638]  Well and the reason why health care has just gone through the roof is because of insurance and putting in false claims to insurance companies and I mean they charge like a hundred dollars for a q-tip.
[01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:40.303]  Whereas if you pay for it out-of-pocket cash, maybe if you have a kid it's $5,000.
[01:35:40.603 --> 01:35:45.266]  I mean it's... That needs to be fixed.
[01:35:45.346 --> 01:35:47.608]  I don't think the governor had too much to do with this.
[01:35:47.888 --> 01:35:52.691]  But we should have gotten rid of the borders, we should have gotten rid of the lines around the state so there's great competition.
[01:35:53.091 --> 01:35:56.594]  The insurance companies are making a fortune on every single thing they do.
[01:35:56.934 --> 01:35:57.214]  Exactly.
[01:35:57.234 --> 01:35:58.695]  I'm self-funding my campaign.
[01:35:58.755 --> 01:36:01.698]  I'm the only one in either party self-funding my campaign.
[01:36:02.018 --> 01:36:03.059]  I'm going to do what's right.
[01:36:03.339 --> 01:36:08.383]  We have to get rid of the lines around the states so that there's serious, serious competition.
[01:36:08.443 --> 01:36:17.190]  And you're going to see, excuse me, then you're going to see pre-existing conditions and everything else be part of it, but the price will be down and the insurance companies can pay.
[01:36:17.530 --> 01:36:19.271]  Right now they're making a fortune.
[01:36:19.612 --> 01:36:21.733]  Yeah, it's a mandate without competition.
[01:36:21.913 --> 01:36:22.654]  That's what they've got.
[01:36:22.674 --> 01:36:23.555]  They're just pointing out.
[01:36:24.435 --> 01:36:25.495]  It's called competition, Dana.
[01:36:25.515 --> 01:36:26.616]  That's why CNN's not doing so well.
[01:36:26.656 --> 01:36:26.796]  Right.
[01:36:26.816 --> 01:36:28.976]  Pay us to not compete for any of your business.
[01:36:49.841 --> 01:36:51.781]  He's like, Trump, I gave you that bit of information.
[01:36:51.821 --> 01:36:52.181]  Oh my god.
[01:36:52.221 --> 01:36:53.182]  Condescending little baby.
[01:36:53.342 --> 01:36:53.622]  It is!
[01:37:15.446 --> 01:37:19.568]  Notice how he's pointing to all the audience.
[01:37:20.008 --> 01:37:22.849]  All these lobbyists.
[01:37:22.909 --> 01:37:29.632]  He's starting to move around too much, his Apple box is going to break.
[01:37:29.852 --> 01:37:32.453]  Oh, now Wall Street doesn't like Rubio.
[01:37:33.573 --> 01:37:37.014]  He's got more money from Wall Street than Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton.
[01:37:37.074 --> 01:37:37.835]  He's number one.
[01:37:37.995 --> 01:37:41.116]  He was trying to ride the establishment momentum into Nevada.
[01:37:42.892 --> 01:37:44.913]  Unbelievable.
[01:37:44.933 --> 01:37:47.715]  The Anchor Baby isn't the boy toy of Wall Street.
[01:37:47.735 --> 01:37:50.096]  That's what happened in New York.
[01:37:51.016 --> 01:37:54.078]  They injected some courage into them to finally stand up and do something.
[01:37:54.098 --> 01:37:57.320]  But it's not going to look too good tomorrow, I guarantee you that.
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:58.921]  Tell them you hate us.
[01:37:59.221 --> 01:38:00.982]  Tell them you hate all of us on Wall Street.
[01:38:01.062 --> 01:38:02.863]  Here's another million.
[01:38:02.883 --> 01:38:05.324]  Just tell them you hate us.
[01:38:05.364 --> 01:38:07.965]  You can't be establishment anymore if you want to be successful.
[01:38:09.466 --> 01:38:14.250]  Anti-establishment, you know, hate the big banks, hate everything pretty much.
[01:38:14.350 --> 01:38:19.894]  Now they're going to start coming out looking like protesters and hat turned to the side.
[01:38:20.094 --> 01:38:26.940]  A good thing that's happening is that we're all here tonight heaping ridicule on these establishment candidates.
[01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:29.562]  We've kissed the rear end of the mainstream media for too long.
[01:38:29.882 --> 01:38:30.743]  We've groveled to them.
[01:38:30.763 --> 01:38:34.346]  We've let the mainstream media pundits, the Donald Trump media, set the narrative.
[01:38:34.386 --> 01:38:37.908]  Let's not forget the reason I'm supporting Trump and that's with, you know,
[01:38:38.929 --> 01:38:39.129]  Yeah.
[01:38:39.490 --> 01:38:39.730]  Right.
[01:38:58.010 --> 01:38:59.671]  He said a lot of things I disagree with, quite frankly.
[01:38:59.691 --> 01:39:02.973]  The point is, he is definitely from outside the system and they're scared.
[01:39:03.954 --> 01:39:06.515]  We know the stagnant course we're going on is destruction.
[01:39:07.016 --> 01:39:07.836]  Are we gambling?
[01:39:07.856 --> 01:39:12.899]  A lot of folks here at this office, like David, who's been against Trump, but now because he says he wants to audit the Fed.
[01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:15.402]  He wants 9-11 truth to come out.
[01:39:16.243 --> 01:39:18.085]  He wants to do so many other things.
[01:39:18.105 --> 01:39:18.946]  He's for sovereignty.
[01:39:18.966 --> 01:39:20.047]  He's against the TPP.
[01:39:20.628 --> 01:39:23.371]  Because of that, you're pretty much forced to support him, in my view.
[01:39:24.012 --> 01:39:25.935]  As for Ted Cruz, he's going to end up losing.
[01:39:26.395 --> 01:39:27.436]  Same thing with Marco Rubio.
[01:39:27.456 --> 01:39:30.140]  He's basically a Republican version of Obama.
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:33.004]  Uh, but everybody said this for months.
[01:39:33.284 --> 01:39:34.145]  We've said it for a year.
[01:39:34.506 --> 01:39:37.770]  Trump's popular because he's seen as outside the system.
[01:39:37.810 --> 01:39:40.174]  Well, this just shows how weak the system is.
[01:39:40.214 --> 01:39:43.719]  So regardless of what happens to Donald Trump, the system is in deep trouble.
[01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:45.562]  And the fact that they're panicking...
[01:39:47.042 --> 01:39:55.104]  The fact that they're panicking right now, and the whole system is against Trump, really illustrates that what he's doing scares them, and that they don't own him, they don't buy him.
[01:39:55.164 --> 01:40:01.366]  And it shows how our politicians have been bought and paid for, not just by special interests, but multinational special interests.
[01:40:01.386 --> 01:40:02.666]  And it's easy to bash special interests.
[01:40:02.926 --> 01:40:04.687]  They call the American people special interests.
[01:40:05.087 --> 01:40:08.509]  Or they call a filmmaker making their own film that has political views special interest.
[01:40:08.529 --> 01:40:11.111]  They want to shut down our speech claiming a special interest.
[01:40:11.311 --> 01:40:15.613]  What I want to shut down is foreign multinationals that are tax-exempt above the law.
[01:40:15.633 --> 01:40:16.654]  That's what globalism is.
[01:40:17.074 --> 01:40:21.196]  Coming in and setting precedents, controlling our media, buying our politicians.
[01:40:21.517 --> 01:40:27.040]  China is buying up the Chicago Stock Exchange, the mercantile, the biggest in the world, but fourth largest.
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:30.202]  Uh, they're coming in, buying up media, dictating what can be in films.
[01:40:30.602 --> 01:40:32.183]  And the media goes, oh, you're against Chinese people.
[01:40:32.223 --> 01:40:39.688]  No, I'm against the murdering Chinese Communist Party that harvests political dissidents' organs and has slave factories and one-child policies, killing millions of little girls.
[01:40:40.048 --> 01:40:42.590]  I'm against them dictating my life and Zuckerberg and others.
[01:40:43.230 --> 01:40:47.353]  Not wanting the FBI to censor them or control them, but, oh, we're all ready for China to do that.
[01:40:47.774 --> 01:40:49.174]  These are the big epic issues.
[01:40:49.735 --> 01:40:54.378]  And they're scared of Trump, so that's why I am cautiously supporting him.
[01:40:54.598 --> 01:40:57.080]  But there's no doubt in my mind, he's the guy to get behind.
[01:40:58.321 --> 01:41:01.984]  I know we've got these guys battling back and forth, arguing about health care, arguing about this and that.
[01:41:02.965 --> 01:41:08.509]  I like Carson's intro personally the best about, listen, nobody on this stage is going to save this country.
[01:41:09.170 --> 01:41:11.291]  And that's one problem I have with Trump is he acts like, I'll fix it.
[01:41:11.812 --> 01:41:18.818]  No, we need to turn loose these systems and the rules that made this country the greatest in the world.
[01:41:19.238 --> 01:41:26.144]  And if we're watching television all day, and here I am on TV, but most of it's dumbed down, if we're spectators, if we're these little soft robots,
[01:41:26.604 --> 01:41:29.126]  That are waddling around that I see everywhere, myself included.
[01:41:29.586 --> 01:41:31.467]  I'm soft compared to my grandfathers or my dad.
[01:41:32.007 --> 01:41:33.568]  But I'm hard compared to most folks.
[01:41:33.608 --> 01:41:35.790]  Very hard working and very strong compared to the average person.
[01:41:35.810 --> 01:41:39.292]  I'm like a vicious animal, a primal person compared to the general public.
[01:41:39.492 --> 01:41:40.433]  So is most of my crew.
[01:41:40.733 --> 01:41:43.435]  Which shows how domesticated people have gotten.
[01:41:43.455 --> 01:41:51.680]  And I love seeing the reporters I've hired in the last four, five, six years, who were great people when I hired them, get even stronger as they're immersed in this reality.
[01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:54.682]  That which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger, to quote Nishi.
[01:41:55.302 --> 01:42:01.605]  And so it's facing these crises, it's facing the fact that we're being enslaved, that'll make us strong in the animating contest of liberty.
[01:42:02.065 --> 01:42:10.869]  So I'd like to hear all of you, you know, we can take a few minutes and listen to this debate going back and forth, but then I'd like to hear all of you's views on the frontrunner Donald Trump, because he really is the presumptive nominee.
[01:42:11.149 --> 01:42:12.329]  The whole system's against him.
[01:42:12.909 --> 01:42:18.472]  By now they would have already pretty much been thrown in the towel saying, well, we're just going with the motions, but instead they're going to fight to the end and Ann Rubio,
[01:42:19.372 --> 01:42:20.413]  At 200 top donors.
[01:42:20.853 --> 01:42:22.174]  The Associated Press reported tonight.
[01:42:22.194 --> 01:42:23.594]  It's on DrugsReport.com.
[01:42:23.615 --> 01:42:25.135]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:42:25.155 --> 01:42:26.316]  200 of them meet with Richard Reeves.
[01:42:26.336 --> 01:42:27.277]  He keeps warning us.
[01:42:27.737 --> 01:42:29.138]  You really heard it here first six months ago.
[01:42:29.198 --> 01:42:30.018]  Richard obsessing on it.
[01:42:30.278 --> 01:42:32.139]  Our political correspondent who's in Houston tonight.
[01:42:32.159 --> 01:42:33.240]  We might want to talk to him later.
[01:42:34.261 --> 01:42:36.102]  And I know he's driving out today about 3 o'clock.
[01:42:36.122 --> 01:42:37.142]  I don't know if he made it down there.
[01:42:37.162 --> 01:42:37.963]  He's been working so hard.
[01:42:38.823 --> 01:42:45.549]  But Richard pointed out they're trying to have the version of this delegate steal, superdelegate thing that Hillary's doing, with the Republicans.
[01:42:45.569 --> 01:42:46.690]  It's called a broker convention.
[01:42:46.930 --> 01:42:51.954]  And they're getting the big donors and the superdelegates, the equivalent, because they have the same thing, but it's not called superdelegates.
[01:42:52.595 --> 01:42:57.980]  These key people from broker convention that represent the other delegates, ready to steal it for Rubio.
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:02.924]  And that's why the Bushes are there tonight, you know, wanting their facade to stay up like they're from Texas.
[01:43:02.944 --> 01:43:04.205]  Nothing against Kennebunkport, Maine.
[01:43:04.565 --> 01:43:05.026]  But it's like,
[01:43:05.586 --> 01:43:08.568]  It's like Cruz going, I'm from Texas, I'm tough and all this stuff.
[01:43:09.448 --> 01:43:12.550]  I mean, as an 8th generation Texan, I don't have some great mystique about it.
[01:43:12.570 --> 01:43:13.151]  I love Texas.
[01:43:13.531 --> 01:43:20.615]  But man, to watch folks that really aren't Texans sit there all day long and talk about how they're from Texas or what was part of Texas, Oklahoma.
[01:43:20.695 --> 01:43:21.856]  I say that's Texas quite frankly.
[01:43:22.236 --> 01:43:23.297]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[01:43:23.977 --> 01:43:25.559]  And I'm tired of it.
[01:43:25.619 --> 01:43:27.421]  So that's what this comes down to.
[01:43:27.441 --> 01:43:29.783]  You've got a lot of people claiming they're for this, they're for that.
[01:43:30.123 --> 01:43:38.671]  Until we break out of the matrix ourselves, until we realize that this is a world government, satanic system we're facing, we don't have a hope of ever changing.
[01:43:38.731 --> 01:43:39.953]  And that's the issue we're getting to.
[01:43:40.173 --> 01:43:43.096]  And then Kit Daniels in a little while is also going to be popping in here.
[01:43:43.516 --> 01:43:46.080]  Alex, we do have Richard on the ground, actually.
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:48.202]  He came in already, but he's ready to pop back in again.
[01:43:48.222 --> 01:43:50.465]  Okay, well, I must have been in the bathroom or something when he popped in.
[01:43:50.506 --> 01:43:51.367]  Great, I'm glad he's there.
[01:43:51.387 --> 01:43:56.053]  I'm going to throw it back to Leanne, Jakari, and, of course, Biggs and Knight and the rest of the crew.
[01:43:56.073 --> 01:43:57.515]  And I'm going to go ahead and punch out here.
[01:43:57.535 --> 01:43:58.576]  I'm going to probably call in.
[01:43:58.596 --> 01:44:01.040]  I'm going to go see my children for a few hours tonight.
[01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:05.383]  I'm going to call in at the end of the coverage, but great job crew and great job to all the listeners and viewers.
[01:44:05.903 --> 01:44:11.007]  Uh, we were busting our butt to bring you true alternative, uh, media analysis of what's happening.
[01:44:11.047 --> 01:44:19.672]  And we're also going to have some later, but there's going to print them off some Facebook mentioned questions, uh, that we'll try to get, uh, folks to, uh, basically debate and talk about here on air.
[01:44:19.712 --> 01:44:28.758]  But, uh, where are you guys on Donald Trump is what I think it comes down to and how are they going to try to shoot him down and shut him down with the New York Times writer coming out and saying, we need to assassinate Donald Trump today.
[01:44:28.818 --> 01:44:30.860]  That being a big story and then full wars.com.
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:36.745]  Well, you know, Alex, you were talking about Ted Cruz and how it bristles you a little bit to hear him say he's from Texas.
[01:44:37.225 --> 01:44:38.366]  I knew Texas was big.
[01:44:38.386 --> 01:44:41.429]  I didn't know that they extended all the way into Canada, though.
[01:44:41.769 --> 01:44:42.550]  Well, I wish it did.
[01:44:42.570 --> 01:44:45.492]  And all the way down to Cuba.
[01:44:46.053 --> 01:44:46.433]  Exactly.
[01:44:46.453 --> 01:44:51.597]  For the viewers that are watching on Facebook right now, because you're not getting an audio feed, David Knight said, I knew Texas was big.
[01:44:52.378 --> 01:44:54.961]  But I didn't know it extended all the way to Canada, and then all the way to Cuba.
[01:44:55.221 --> 01:44:59.887]  And quite frankly, if somebody's a patriot, I don't care where they come from, but we gotta follow the Constitution.
[01:45:00.347 --> 01:45:06.074]  Because back in the age that it was set up, they would send in foreign princes into other countries to try to get them to take over.
[01:45:06.094 --> 01:45:09.238]  Like Mexico was run by the Austro-Hungarian Empire by Maximilian.
[01:45:09.878 --> 01:45:10.940]  I mean, this has been ongoing.
[01:45:12.034 --> 01:45:12.574]  Italian Wars.
[01:45:12.614 --> 01:45:13.915]  In fact, you want to come on in here real quick, Kit?
[01:45:14.856 --> 01:45:15.496]  I'm going to go ahead.
[01:45:15.516 --> 01:45:16.997]  You probably need your own earpiece.
[01:45:17.017 --> 01:45:18.018]  We're all sharing this one here.
[01:45:18.498 --> 01:45:24.042]  I don't know if the United Nations would approve, but they're not going to be able to hear you.
[01:45:24.062 --> 01:45:26.143]  They're not going to be able to hear you, so why don't you do this?
[01:45:26.424 --> 01:45:27.685]  You just pop in for about three minutes.
[01:45:27.705 --> 01:45:29.346]  When you're done, they'll hand it back over to you.
[01:45:29.386 --> 01:45:29.626]  Go ahead.
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:34.924]  Yeah, I briefly want to talk about the Italian Wars in, I think, the 1510, 1520s.
[01:45:34.984 --> 01:45:41.131]  The reason Machiavelli wrote The Prince, because at the time, Italy was these various principalities.
[01:45:41.151 --> 01:45:42.112]  You had the Papal States.
[01:45:42.132 --> 01:45:44.614]  I think you had Milan and some other countries.
[01:45:45.075 --> 01:45:46.176]  But there really weren't any countries.
[01:45:46.196 --> 01:45:47.097]  They're just kind of, you know...
[01:45:48.098 --> 01:45:58.550]  But it's interesting to note that, yeah, it's like you had these foreign princes, like you had the Haasburgs, you know, the Spanish that were trying to go into Italy, take it over.
[01:45:58.611 --> 01:46:00.833]  You had the French that were trying to go into Italy, take it over.
[01:46:01.494 --> 01:46:04.998]  So this whole peninsula for like 20, 30 years was just a complete...
[01:46:06.403 --> 01:46:07.464]  It was just a complete system.
[01:46:07.484 --> 01:46:08.564]  Yeah, a war zone.
[01:46:08.925 --> 01:46:10.766]  It was just a complete war zone.
[01:46:11.406 --> 01:46:12.587]  So, I mean, that's what's going on now.
[01:46:12.627 --> 01:46:16.009]  You've got the TPP, and then you've got the Obamacare and everything.
[01:46:16.069 --> 01:46:25.035]  It's just this whole foreign interest writing the law, coming into the country, buying off all the politicians, and you've got the Chinese that are coming in.
[01:46:25.595 --> 01:46:25.835]  Yeah.
[01:46:26.656 --> 01:46:32.259]  Oh, but let's not point out, someone on Twitter said how Trump would be for the TPP because it gives us more power.
[01:46:34.508 --> 01:46:35.008]  I don't know.
[01:46:56.644 --> 01:46:57.545]  You got Saudi Arabia.
[01:46:57.605 --> 01:47:04.089]  I mean, it says a lot when China speaks out against Trump because he won in Nevada.
[01:47:04.329 --> 01:47:08.893]  Because it's like, what does China have to do with our elections?
[01:47:09.313 --> 01:47:11.234]  And then it's also this whole Telemundo thing.
[01:47:11.434 --> 01:47:14.056]  CNN's acting like Telemundo is going to
[01:47:15.247 --> 01:47:20.168]  Well, one of the things that I think was interesting, and while we were talking...
[01:47:39.913 --> 01:47:50.626]  Ben Carson gave a very detailed, very wise approach to health care, which is basically saying, hey, we can have Medicare savings accounts, personal medical savings accounts.
[01:47:51.247 --> 01:47:57.394]  That would be something that could be handed on to your descendants if you don't have anything, if you've got something left over at the end of the day.
[01:47:57.975 --> 01:47:59.216]  That's a really good approach.
[01:47:59.396 --> 01:48:04.018]  Trump had a good idea in terms of, let's have competition between the insurance companies.
[01:48:04.038 --> 01:48:08.099]  Let's let them cross across state borders in terms of competing with each other.
[01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:09.580]  Let's have more competition.
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:12.962]  And of course, Marco Rubio tried to troll him on that.
[01:48:12.982 --> 01:48:16.103]  Say, you're repeating, open the, you know, take down the lines.
[01:48:16.303 --> 01:48:17.083]  You keep repeating that.
[01:48:17.103 --> 01:48:19.044]  And it's like, yeah, because you keep talking over me.
[01:48:19.124 --> 01:48:19.985]  I think, you know.
[01:48:20.065 --> 01:48:23.106]  And he shouldn't say anything about repeating things over him.
[01:48:23.206 --> 01:48:31.982]  Well, he had, let's understand, Marco Rubio had been trained and said, hey, we're going to have you do... I agree, David, but what's he going to do to stop Trump?
[01:48:32.263 --> 01:48:33.265]  He's going to be the nominee.
[01:48:33.285 --> 01:48:35.168]  I think they're going to try to kill him.
[01:48:36.035 --> 01:48:36.575]  Well, they may.
[01:48:36.836 --> 01:48:48.165]  If you look at what happened so far tonight in the debate, Alex, what we've seen is we've seen Rubio throw up, as non-sequiturs, every bit of dirt that's been put out in the press this last week.
[01:48:48.185 --> 01:48:48.826]  He'd throw them up.
[01:48:48.846 --> 01:48:55.411]  They'd ask him a question about amnesty, for example, and then he would start criticizing Donald Trump about H-1B visa workers when
[01:48:56.212 --> 01:49:01.355]  Rubio doesn't answer the question about amnesty, and when Rubio tripled the number of H-1B visa programs.
[01:49:01.375 --> 01:49:05.598]  So that's what we've seen tonight, that kind of pre-planned attack.
[01:49:05.858 --> 01:49:09.600]  And of course we're going to see a lot of pre-planned attacks that are going to be coming out in this next week.
[01:49:10.181 --> 01:49:13.003]  Bottom line, as far as I look at this, is Alex...
[01:49:13.883 --> 01:49:19.186]  I don't see any difference between any of these guys on the things that I find important.
[01:49:19.687 --> 01:49:20.467]  Individual liberty.
[01:49:20.767 --> 01:49:22.168]  How they're going to support the Constitution.
[01:49:22.188 --> 01:49:27.051]  The very fact that Ted Cruz... But you said on trifecta, on the triad, Trump is anti-global.
[01:49:27.191 --> 01:49:28.092]  And that's the difference.
[01:49:28.732 --> 01:49:29.312]  That's the difference.
[01:49:29.352 --> 01:49:35.916]  That's something... I've got a reason to vote for Trump, which is to basically give the middle finger to the GOP establishment.
[01:49:36.017 --> 01:49:36.597]  That's one reason.
[01:49:37.097 --> 01:49:43.083]  I think he's going to do something positive in terms of opposing all three legs of the globalist takeover.
[01:49:43.684 --> 01:49:44.845]  And the rest of the... This is key.
[01:49:45.146 --> 01:49:53.394]  Mention those three and then I want to get Leanne and Biggs' take and then I'm going to keep marching around with this Facebook mentions and let you guys get back to the main transmission here.
[01:49:54.155 --> 01:49:56.838]  But we are truly multimedia battling the globalists right now.
[01:49:57.538 --> 01:50:06.122]  And we're going to talk about the fact that Trump's rise and the rise as well of people like Bernie Sanders just shows how dead the mainstream media is.
[01:50:06.502 --> 01:50:07.462]  I mean, Trump's not perfect.
[01:50:07.502 --> 01:50:08.083]  I'm not perfect.
[01:50:08.103 --> 01:50:08.723]  You're not perfect.
[01:50:08.863 --> 01:50:09.123]  That's right.
[01:50:09.143 --> 01:50:14.685]  But the fact that the more they attack him, the more powerful he gets just shows the elite is out of gas.
[01:50:15.066 --> 01:50:16.786]  They're in deep, deep trouble as we complete.
[01:50:17.086 --> 01:50:18.167]  And just as I heard of mentions.
[01:50:18.467 --> 01:50:28.823]  As I heard a pastor say today on the radio, talking about Trump, he said, look, you know, for too long, evangelicals, why are they supporting Trump in larger numbers than they are Ted Cruz?
[01:50:28.863 --> 01:50:33.751]  Because they understand that there are different ways to get these things done that are important to them.
[01:50:34.091 --> 01:50:35.492]  Rather than having the president do it.
[01:50:35.532 --> 01:50:41.674]  So they're looking at the president who would do things like control the borders, like take down the trade that's being made.
[01:50:41.694 --> 01:50:44.655]  And not just have a president that gives them fake Christian Pharisee rhetoric.
[01:50:44.815 --> 01:50:45.255]  Exactly.
[01:50:45.275 --> 01:50:46.716]  People are sick of fake Christians.
[01:50:46.916 --> 01:50:47.436]  I'm a Christian.
[01:50:47.456 --> 01:50:47.736]  I love Jesus.
[01:50:47.756 --> 01:50:50.337]  But I don't want to sit here and tell you what a great Christian I am all day.
[01:50:50.517 --> 01:50:50.817]  That's right.
[01:50:50.837 --> 01:50:51.678]  I'm just going to fight tyranny.
[01:50:51.698 --> 01:50:52.218]  That's the end of it.
[01:50:52.458 --> 01:50:58.725]  And those types of things need to be done by us in our community, rather than thinking that the President is going to do it.
[01:50:58.745 --> 01:51:03.871]  That's what I liked what Carson said, and you let people get their power by cutting taxes, cutting regulations.
[01:51:03.911 --> 01:51:06.614]  How are we going to compete with China when they have all these regulations?
[01:51:06.914 --> 01:51:13.381]  Your take on Trump, Leanne McAdoo, as I do Facebook mentions, as we go out on radio and TV across the country, we have the main feeds here.
[01:51:14.045 --> 01:51:16.026]  Well, I think, you know, you guys nailed it.
[01:51:16.066 --> 01:51:29.069]  It's just, it's very obvious when you see Communist China coming in and all these other countries with their opinion on who we, the American people, should be electing because it's gonna, it'll be to the detriment of them and what they've got going on.
[01:51:29.089 --> 01:51:32.850]  And that's what Trump says in his opening thing, is like, we need to start winning again.
[01:51:32.930 --> 01:51:33.731]  We need to start winning.
[01:51:33.771 --> 01:51:34.131]  That's right.
[01:51:34.151 --> 01:51:35.811]  We've been sold out to foreign interests.
[01:51:35.871 --> 01:51:36.912]  That's what the globalists hate.
[01:51:37.252 --> 01:51:40.393]  All these foreign interests are being very naked about, hey, we own you.
[01:51:40.693 --> 01:51:41.033]  Shut up.
[01:51:41.053 --> 01:51:41.933]  You can't have who you want.
[01:51:42.153 --> 01:51:42.813]  That's right.
[01:51:42.853 --> 01:51:43.594]  Yeah, don't let them know.
[01:51:43.634 --> 01:51:46.536]  You got China, you got Mexico telling us who we should elect for president.
[01:51:46.616 --> 01:51:49.017]  Oh, I forgot, the Mexican president now, Vicente Fox.
[01:51:49.477 --> 01:51:51.479]  Don't they know this just makes Americans madder, Leigh-Anne?
[01:51:51.859 --> 01:51:55.301]  I mean, apparently they don't, because they're doubling, tripling down on it.
[01:51:55.701 --> 01:51:56.421]  And it does.
[01:51:56.481 --> 01:51:58.223]  I mean, these debates don't even matter.
[01:51:58.263 --> 01:52:00.504]  It's the people showing up in record numbers.
[01:52:00.824 --> 01:52:03.846]  You see some of these people in line at the caucus there, or in Nevada.
[01:52:04.166 --> 01:52:08.629]  You could tell these people were never involved in politics before, but they were, like, standing in line.
[01:52:08.649 --> 01:52:10.530]  They were going to make sure that they got to vote.
[01:52:11.070 --> 01:52:14.873]  And that's, I mean, this is something happening across the country.
[01:52:15.333 --> 01:52:17.435]  Because the people are awakening, you know?
[01:52:17.455 --> 01:52:18.696]  It's pretty awesome.
[01:52:18.716 --> 01:52:19.096]  Absolutely.
[01:52:19.256 --> 01:52:22.038]  At the end of the day, the present we have right now makes us look weak.
[01:52:22.138 --> 01:52:23.599]  America looks weak as hell.
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:25.160]  I guarantee you.
[01:52:26.221 --> 01:52:29.702]  No one is scared of President Obama, because we've seen what's going on.
[01:52:30.602 --> 01:52:32.462]  The American people are scared.
[01:52:32.563 --> 01:52:35.523]  I mean, multinationally.
[01:52:35.543 --> 01:52:36.083]  He's a globalist.
[01:52:36.103 --> 01:52:36.964]  He wants to weaken us.
[01:52:37.384 --> 01:52:43.085]  But I guarantee you, someone like Trump gets in there, you're not going to see Navy sailors crying on a ship.
[01:52:43.545 --> 01:52:46.326]  We're not going to see the Army having to wear red high heels?
[01:52:46.346 --> 01:52:50.867]  I mean, nothing wrong with Leanne wearing them, but my goodness, you're going to wear red high heels?
[01:52:50.887 --> 01:52:51.507]  I don't think I am.
[01:52:51.587 --> 01:52:51.727]  No.
[01:52:52.447 --> 01:52:53.108]  Not gonna happen.
[01:52:53.128 --> 01:52:54.931]  You would not follow orders, Obama.
[01:52:56.514 --> 01:53:00.600]  I was never the greatest order follower in the military anyways.
[01:53:00.620 --> 01:53:01.842]  I always kind of did my own thing.
[01:53:02.223 --> 01:53:03.144]  Really, Jones?
[01:53:04.066 --> 01:53:04.947]  What I thought was right.
[01:53:05.027 --> 01:53:05.508]  I went with that.
[01:53:05.548 --> 01:53:06.369]  Don't say.
[01:53:06.569 --> 01:53:07.531]  No, you guys did a great job.
[01:53:07.831 --> 01:53:08.572]  No, but you know what?
[01:53:08.612 --> 01:53:09.613]  Trump's going to go in there.
[01:53:09.673 --> 01:53:10.914]  He's going to put the fear in China.
[01:53:10.954 --> 01:53:12.755]  The fact that China's coming, I go, we don't want this guy.
[01:53:12.775 --> 01:53:13.856]  Because they're scared.
[01:53:14.197 --> 01:53:16.058]  They know that he's going to come out there and do something.
[01:53:16.078 --> 01:53:18.780]  The fact that you've got all these leaders coming around, like, shaking.
[01:53:18.821 --> 01:53:20.682]  Like, every time they hear the word Trump, they're scared.
[01:53:20.702 --> 01:53:21.463]  We're their customer.
[01:53:21.803 --> 01:53:23.404]  They're not buying anything from us.
[01:53:23.685 --> 01:53:24.705]  We're buying stuff from them.
[01:53:24.725 --> 01:53:25.506]  They need to listen to us.
[01:53:25.526 --> 01:53:26.147]  Guys, keep going.
[01:53:26.187 --> 01:53:30.010]  I'm going to march out of here and say hi to Jakaria and some of the guys in the control room and gals in the control room.
[01:53:30.030 --> 01:53:31.091]  You guys keep doing your live coverage.
[01:53:31.111 --> 01:53:31.531]  Great job.
[01:53:31.851 --> 01:53:32.552]  Alex Jones here.
[01:53:32.572 --> 01:53:33.133]  I'm going to keep going.
[01:53:33.153 --> 01:53:35.014]  I'm going to walk into the other part of the building.
[01:53:35.074 --> 01:53:35.835]  I've got Buckley with me.
[01:53:36.095 --> 01:53:40.738]  The question here again from CNN, can Trump's plan or tax plan work?
[01:53:40.878 --> 01:53:43.299]  Everything is targeted towards Trump.
[01:53:43.379 --> 01:53:44.319]  It's absolutely amazing.
[01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:46.941]  Instead of what's your tax plan, what would you do to make things right?
[01:53:47.001 --> 01:53:50.823]  It's like, I want you to attack Trump on this particular policy issue.
[01:53:51.183 --> 01:53:55.826]  Let's go to Richard Reeves, who is outside the debate location there in Houston.
[01:53:55.846 --> 01:53:56.126]  Richard.
[01:53:56.806 --> 01:54:01.449]  Well, David, I'll tell you what, I'm highly offended that you would shoot the middle finger at all.
[01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:06.511]  But, anyway, you've implanted that image in my brain and it can't escape.
[01:54:07.231 --> 01:54:08.912]  I only do it on balance.
[01:54:09.052 --> 01:54:11.513]  That's a metaphor.
[01:54:11.533 --> 01:54:13.795]  A metaphorical finger.
[01:54:14.375 --> 01:54:18.757]  If anybody needs a middle finger shot at them, it's definitely the GOP establishment and the New World Order.
[01:54:18.777 --> 01:54:20.358]  That's probably what Ted Cruz is doing.
[01:54:21.278 --> 01:54:23.879]  You guys missed a very important group that Obama leads.
[01:54:24.059 --> 01:54:27.801]  Obama is definitely the leader of the pooflinger coalition out here.
[01:54:28.649 --> 01:54:31.071]  I'm telling you.
[01:54:31.531 --> 01:54:33.372]  You cannot discount that powerful group.
[01:54:33.992 --> 01:54:37.294]  But anyway, it's very encouraging to see what's going on with the debate.
[01:54:37.855 --> 01:54:41.797]  The more they attack Donald Trump, the more powerful he seems to get.
[01:54:42.898 --> 01:54:49.963]  The latest threat, though, is Mitt Romney coming out, talking about Donald Trump afraid to submit his tax returns.
[01:54:50.403 --> 01:54:53.104]  Well, we think that's part of the splitter strategy as well.
[01:54:53.165 --> 01:54:55.106]  We think Mitt Romney, you know how Joe Biden
[01:54:55.706 --> 01:54:56.307]  We're good to go.
[01:55:15.826 --> 01:55:20.709]  You know, they're going with Marco Rubio right now, potentially being nominated, but they don't even like Marco that much.
[01:55:20.749 --> 01:55:23.430]  Mitt Romney is urging Trump to release his tax returns.
[01:55:23.470 --> 01:55:28.012]  How about they urge, you know, Obama to release the 28 pages.
[01:55:28.033 --> 01:55:28.473]  How about that?
[01:55:29.073 --> 01:55:29.773]  There we go.
[01:55:29.833 --> 01:55:30.394]  Exactly.
[01:55:30.774 --> 01:55:34.456]  I'm more interested in the 28 pages than Donald Trump's tax return.
[01:55:34.496 --> 01:55:35.136]  Far more interested.
[01:55:35.156 --> 01:55:42.460]  Yeah, because the way the government is set up, it's for people like him to get some bombshell things in their tax returns.
[01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:43.621]  I mean, we all know that.
[01:55:44.382 --> 01:55:47.333]  It's not going to be bombshell news to the Greek people.
[01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:52.252]  Turn it around now, and we can say, hey, Mitt Romney, you love the IRS, I guess.
[01:55:52.292 --> 01:55:53.332]  Yeah, that's great.
[01:55:53.412 --> 01:55:54.633]  You can defend the IRS.
[01:55:54.913 --> 01:55:56.074]  That's a great organization.
[01:55:56.434 --> 01:55:57.474]  Endless harassment.
[01:55:58.075 --> 01:55:59.515]  Endless harassment of Americans.
[01:55:59.956 --> 01:56:02.317]  Totally, selectively enforced against Americans.
[01:56:02.697 --> 01:56:03.757]  So, yeah, Mitt Romney.
[01:56:04.118 --> 01:56:05.358]  The IRS, that's great.
[01:56:05.438 --> 01:56:08.340]  You know, Donald Trump, he's probably got some little boo-boo there somewhere.
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:16.824]  But then, that's perfectly, that's exactly the way it's designed, so that nobody... Oh my goodness, a billionaire has figured out how to put his money overseas.
[01:56:17.344 --> 01:56:19.433]  He just pointed out they audited him every year.
[01:56:19.453 --> 01:56:21.080]  He says they've audited me for at least the last 12 years.
[01:56:22.318 --> 01:56:24.800]  Well, that's another bonafide for Donald Trump right there.
[01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:25.400]  What can you say?
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:26.241]  Another bonafide.
[01:56:26.721 --> 01:56:32.085]  So the organization that Mitt Romney endorses has audited Donald Trump every year for 12 years.
[01:56:32.185 --> 01:56:33.525]  How about we audit the Fed?
[01:56:33.926 --> 01:56:36.467]  How about we audit the Fed instead of audit Donald Trump?
[01:56:36.728 --> 01:56:40.490]  How about we release the 28 pages instead of his tax returns?
[01:56:40.610 --> 01:56:45.774]  I mean, I'm far more interested in what this massive criminal organization called the U.S.
[01:56:45.814 --> 01:56:47.375]  government is doing to us.
[01:56:48.275 --> 01:56:52.278]  I mean, it is of interest with Donald Trump, but it is far more interesting what they're doing.
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:55.325]  Final comments, Richard, before we go back to the debate.
[01:56:56.232 --> 01:57:18.121]  Alright, well I'll tell you what, we haven't covered it as far as I know, but maybe I'll talk about it, but this Nevada, Nevada caucuses, when you're adding up Trump, Cruz, Carson, basically the ones that are more interested in liberty and Constitution, etc., anti-establishment, you're talking about anywhere between 72 and 74 percent of the people going with anti-establishment.
[01:57:18.541 --> 01:57:22.763]  Talk about something that's encouraging, that minimizes the establishment road
[01:57:23.383 --> 01:57:27.086]  The lane, the establishment lane, it minimizes them to around, you know, 25%.
[01:57:27.126 --> 01:57:31.549]  That is super encouraging to see them be under a 30% threshold.
[01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:32.069]  That's right.
[01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:35.711]  Rubio is the 20% solution for the Wall Street donors.
[01:57:36.372 --> 01:57:40.735]  He's telling everybody, repeating the talking patterns that Karl Rove had a couple of months ago saying...
[01:57:41.115 --> 01:57:43.036]  Well, Donald Trump had a threshold of 30%.
[01:57:43.577 --> 01:57:46.419]  Well, now we're seeing that's up in the mid-40s or higher.
[01:57:47.019 --> 01:57:48.240]  But anyway, he's repeated that point.
[01:57:48.260 --> 01:57:48.941]  50% in Massachusetts.
[01:57:49.381 --> 01:57:51.403]  That's right, 50% in Massachusetts.
[01:57:51.703 --> 01:57:57.447]  But he repeats that and says, well, he's not going to go any higher than that, so all those other 70% of the people are going to come to me.
[01:57:57.487 --> 01:57:59.669]  And it's like, well, by the same token, if he wants to say that.
[01:58:00.149 --> 01:58:03.110]  Rubio's never gotten more than about, what, 23, 24%?
[01:58:04.270 --> 01:58:09.111]  So that's his ceiling, which is 10 points lower than what he was saying about Trump at the time.
[01:58:09.611 --> 01:58:11.171]  He really doesn't have a path.
[01:58:11.571 --> 01:58:15.812]  And the debate, the breakdown is not between Rubio and Trump.
[01:58:15.972 --> 01:58:19.513]  It's between the establishment and the non-establishment candidates.
[01:58:19.553 --> 01:58:28.935]  And so I would be far more, I would think that the people who are supporting Carson, who are supporting Cruz even, would be much more likely to break towards Trump
[01:58:29.295 --> 01:58:32.222]  ...than it would be to break towards Rubio as things go on.
[01:58:32.243 --> 01:58:34.749]  Let's go back to the debate and see what they're saying here for a moment.
[01:58:35.660 --> 01:58:39.403]  ...will not be able to serve four to eight years without dealing with the national debt.
[01:58:39.443 --> 01:58:42.786]  It is not a question of if, it is a question of when we have a debt crisis.
[01:58:42.806 --> 01:58:44.967]  It'd be interesting to see if he's talking about the national debt.
[01:58:45.007 --> 01:58:47.630]  Did he sign on to the omnibus bill?
[01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:52.814]  Did he increase the debt ceiling all these times that he's run through, or was he absent on most days?
[01:58:53.074 --> 01:58:58.258]  I bet that these guys voted to extend the debt ceiling, these two guys in the Senate.
[01:58:58.318 --> 01:58:59.079]  Definitely Rubio.
[01:58:59.819 --> 01:59:00.900]  If he showed up that day.
[01:59:00.940 --> 01:59:06.725]  Yeah, if he didn't do that, I don't think the establishment would be very happy with.
[01:59:09.247 --> 01:59:11.969]  So, I've released five years of tax returns already.
[01:59:12.009 --> 01:59:14.331]  We will have two more years available tomorrow.
[01:59:15.252 --> 01:59:18.975]  And I would note that this question really goes, you know, Donald says he's being audited.
[01:59:19.395 --> 01:59:23.076]  Well, I would think that would underscore the need to release those returns.
[01:59:23.156 --> 01:59:27.978]  If he has said something... Oh yeah, because the IRS would never audit anybody for political reasons.
[01:59:28.098 --> 01:59:29.438]  Give me a break!
[01:59:29.678 --> 01:59:30.458]  Give me a break!
[01:59:30.859 --> 01:59:32.379]  But where has Ted Cruz been?
[01:59:32.639 --> 01:59:37.020]  Did he hear about the Tea Party organizations getting audited and jerked around by the IRS?
[01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:41.862]  Of course they would, you know, it automatically makes you a criminal if you get audited by the IRS.
[01:59:42.222 --> 01:59:45.745]  Donald is not the right candidate to go against Hillary Clinton.
[01:59:45.766 --> 01:59:48.808]  Now part of the reason... And the American people will disagree.
[01:59:48.828 --> 01:59:52.112]  In the last ten polls on RealClearPolitics, he's lost to Hillary on eight of them.
[01:59:52.552 --> 01:59:56.716]  In the last ten polls on RealClearPolitics, I either tie or beat Hillary.
[01:59:57.157 --> 01:59:58.198]  And this is an example.
[01:59:58.378 --> 02:00:00.260]  You know, the mainstream media is laying off Donald.
[02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:01.761]  Let's pick and choose.
[02:00:01.861 --> 02:00:03.703]  Every single website has polls.
[02:00:03.803 --> 02:00:05.705]  So let's go ahead and pick the one that suits our needs.
[02:00:07.226 --> 02:00:07.907]  Yeah.
[02:00:08.087 --> 02:00:09.928]  That's why polls are a weak place.
[02:00:10.008 --> 02:00:10.188]  Yeah.
[02:00:34.801 --> 02:00:38.202]  I don't think that's the case.
[02:00:38.222 --> 02:00:46.445]  I think he's going to pull a lot of Democrats in.
[02:00:46.525 --> 02:00:50.646]  I think he's going to have like a Reagan Democrat coalition.
[02:00:50.666 --> 02:00:56.188]  Well, it's interesting how you see some of these establishment Republicans saying, well, I'd rather see Hillary Clinton in there.
[02:00:56.428 --> 02:01:03.030]  It's just every, we're really starting to see the layers peeled back of the puppet masters in this country.
[02:01:03.370 --> 02:01:07.991]  Hey, guys, Darren McBreen just came up to me and said people are complaining that we're not letting the debate go on.
[02:01:08.072 --> 02:01:12.973]  You know, you can always change the channel and go watch the debate on CNN uninterrupted.
[02:01:13.733 --> 02:01:14.914]  More power to you if you want to do that.
[02:01:14.974 --> 02:01:22.256]  But if you want to get what's really going on, the story behind the story, the articles that are supporting everything we're saying, stay tuned in here.
[02:01:25.017 --> 02:01:30.639]  They're just back because their mom hasn't brought us a new, uh, brought them a new bowl of popcorn or refilled their Doritos or Cheetos.
[02:01:30.699 --> 02:01:34.941]  Well, let's make it clear, let's make it clear as we have in the past.
[02:01:34.961 --> 02:01:36.882]  Let's make it clear as we have in the past.
[02:01:36.902 --> 02:01:39.823]  What we're providing for you is real-time analysis and commentary.
[02:01:39.983 --> 02:01:40.403]  Exactly.
[02:01:40.543 --> 02:01:44.544]  And we are watching this, we're watching the, uh, uh, the subtitles as they come up.
[02:01:44.885 --> 02:01:47.165]  So we're commenting on that as well as it's going through here.
[02:01:47.185 --> 02:01:53.308]  Uh, you can do the same thing or you can put on both, uh, streams if you want to listen to the debate simultaneously.
[02:01:54.128 --> 02:01:55.449]  And, you know, they have subtitles.
[02:01:55.469 --> 02:01:58.611]  You can read what's going on, and then you can hear what we're saying and see how it works.
[02:01:58.671 --> 02:02:05.916]  Because, yeah, we are going to miss a few things that they say, but I think, all in all, you got, what, four gas bags and Donald Trump up there?
[02:02:05.956 --> 02:02:07.036]  Well, what they're talking about.
[02:02:07.056 --> 02:02:08.157]  Trump is great.
[02:02:08.177 --> 02:02:10.579]  This is all establishment talking points, people.
[02:02:10.779 --> 02:02:11.419]  Like, oh, I'm great.
[02:02:11.439 --> 02:02:13.921]  I'm going to make America... I'm going to step it up for you.
[02:02:14.141 --> 02:02:17.024]  They're talking about dueling polls and that sort of thing.
[02:02:17.124 --> 02:02:20.909]  And again, just like the Telemundo poll, we know that you can push these polls.
[02:02:20.929 --> 02:02:22.831]  You can make them say whatever you want.
[02:02:22.971 --> 02:02:27.957]  There was a poll that showed him ahead of Donald Trump and then he got a shellacking the next day.
[02:02:30.479 --> 02:02:45.165]  I don't think anyone in America is going to be shocked if he has done something as a billionaire with his taxes.
[02:02:45.225 --> 02:02:49.687]  I mean, we have said this again and again, this is a huge issue in this country.
[02:02:49.727 --> 02:02:53.689]  You have a bunch of politicians on stage trying to debate which one is the biggest liar.
[02:02:53.909 --> 02:02:55.710]  You know, it's rather amusing to me.
[02:02:56.070 --> 02:02:57.252]  Release your tax returns!
[02:02:57.332 --> 02:02:59.094]  Well, I will as soon as he releases them.
[02:03:16.574 --> 02:03:17.935]  Or her Goldman Sachs speeches.
[02:03:18.016 --> 02:03:18.356]  Yeah.
[02:03:18.396 --> 02:03:19.937]  No one seems to care about that anymore.
[02:03:19.997 --> 02:03:20.358]  Yeah.
[02:03:21.018 --> 02:03:21.779]  This is the thing, too.
[02:03:21.799 --> 02:03:34.011]  You know, this is... I think, you know, certainly you're going to see a deluge of personal attacks coming out in the next couple of days because if they don't take out Trump before Super Tuesday, they don't have another chance.
[02:03:34.311 --> 02:03:38.495]  But I think people are going to see through a lot of this being done at the same time.
[02:03:41.141 --> 02:03:47.787]  I don't know if you guys heard with the exchange they just had and Cruz was talking about, you're getting beat by Hillary in the polls.
[02:03:47.827 --> 02:03:49.769]  Well he's like, if I can't take it, you definitely can't.
[02:03:51.940 --> 02:03:53.161]  It's a civil case.
[02:03:53.521 --> 02:03:54.941]  It's a case where people want to try and get.
[02:03:55.041 --> 02:03:57.102]  It's a case that is nonsense.
[02:03:57.502 --> 02:03:59.143]  It's something I could have settled many times.
[02:03:59.183 --> 02:04:03.164]  I could settle it right now for very little money, but I don't want to do it out of principle.
[02:04:03.204 --> 02:04:09.967]  The people that took the course all signed, most, many, many, signed report cards saying it was fantastic, it was wonderful, it was beautiful.
[02:04:10.707 --> 02:04:12.128]  And believe me, I'll win that case.
[02:04:12.168 --> 02:04:12.968]  That's an easy case.
[02:04:13.148 --> 02:04:13.628]  Civil case.
[02:04:13.968 --> 02:04:14.408]  Number two.
[02:04:15.009 --> 02:04:17.470]  As far as the taxes are concerned, I'm being audited.
[02:04:18.490 --> 02:04:18.730]  Huge!
[02:04:18.750 --> 02:04:18.991]  It's huge!
[02:04:34.605 --> 02:04:38.726]  Now, until that audit's done, and I don't think anybody would blame me, I'm not giving it up.
[02:05:08.573 --> 02:05:12.359]  And let's dispel what's wrong with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing.
[02:05:12.399 --> 02:05:14.582]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[02:05:14.882 --> 02:05:21.933]  We have to make America what you did, and make America great again.
[02:05:27.972 --> 02:05:33.535]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[02:05:33.755 --> 02:05:40.978]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[02:05:41.138 --> 02:05:44.320]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:46.242]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[02:05:46.482 --> 02:05:51.108]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with Nascent Iodine.
[02:05:51.208 --> 02:05:53.230]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.

[02:05:59.637 --> 02:06:01.057]  My name is Alex Jones.
[02:06:01.598 --> 02:06:07.659]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:06:07.900 --> 02:06:22.404]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights,
[02:06:23.024 --> 02:06:25.025]  They're focusing on fighting the globalists.
[02:06:25.385 --> 02:06:33.410]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds and the weight's going off even faster.
[02:06:33.630 --> 02:06:36.212]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated.
[02:06:36.512 --> 02:06:38.113]  My muscle mass increased.
[02:06:38.273 --> 02:06:40.954]  My stamina, my energy levels exploded.

[02:06:58.011 --> 02:07:05.483]  About a year and a half ago, Anthony Gucciardi just said, man, I just did a Dr. Gribbs liver cleanse, the one he recommends.
[02:07:05.643 --> 02:07:08.986]  And he's developing this proprietary stuff he's testing on himself right now.
[02:07:09.087 --> 02:07:09.807]  You really ought to do it.
[02:07:09.927 --> 02:07:11.809]  The results are dramatic after six days.
[02:07:12.030 --> 02:07:13.771]  I'm like, no way, no way I'm doing it.
[02:07:13.892 --> 02:07:17.075]  I don't believe that there's giant black or green balls in my gallbladder.
[02:07:17.095 --> 02:07:18.116]  This is how ignorant I am.
[02:07:18.196 --> 02:07:19.257]  And he's like, look at it online.
[02:07:19.297 --> 02:07:20.518]  I'm not looking at it online.
[02:07:20.578 --> 02:07:21.560]  Stuff like that grosses me out.
[02:07:21.580 --> 02:07:22.180]  I don't want to go there.
[02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:24.863]  Well, finally, about six months ago, they convinced me to do it.
[02:07:24.983 --> 02:07:29.147]  I personally think everybody should go through liver cleansing if you haven't done one.
[02:07:29.187 --> 02:07:30.488]  Results speak for themselves.
[02:07:30.548 --> 02:07:37.974]  I mean, hundreds of thousands of people have done this, and it dates back even a thousand years, drinking oils to cleanse and purge the liver.
[02:07:38.475 --> 02:07:43.299]  Actually, the Greeks and over in India with Ayurvedic medicine have done it the same way.
[02:07:43.359 --> 02:07:49.144]  But how it works is, what you should do, and this is what our proprietary research led us to do back
[02:07:49.324 --> 02:08:03.174]  Starting in the early 90s when we were looking at the best ways to cleanse the liver was to develop an herbal formula that contains herbs that will help soften or break down these globules or these stones in the liver and the gallbladder.
[02:08:03.314 --> 02:08:04.575]  This liver shield is
[02:08:04.775 --> 02:08:09.098]  The high-quality, proprietary liver trex developed by Dr. Gribb that we've private-labeled through him.
[02:08:09.238 --> 02:08:13.241]  And it's extremely strong, extremely concentrated, extremely high-powered.
[02:08:13.301 --> 02:08:19.165]  You combine that with the Oxy Powder, oxygen-based intestinal cleanser, dietary supplement, clinically tested.
[02:08:19.225 --> 02:08:22.227]  We have them discounted at the lowest price you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:08:22.347 --> 02:08:23.928]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:08:24.148 --> 02:08:26.930]  Obviously, folks should probably talk to their healthcare provider before they do this.
[02:08:27.090 --> 02:08:32.514]  This is one of the single biggest results, if not the biggest, I've ever seen in my life, literally in a six-day period.
[02:08:32.594 --> 02:08:34.075]  This is something anybody can do,
[02:08:34.435 --> 02:08:37.416]  Obviously, the literature is well known on what liver cleanses do.
[02:08:37.436 --> 02:08:39.396]  This is the best one out there from our research.
[02:08:39.476 --> 02:08:43.117]  InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:08:43.157 --> 02:09:01.842]  The InfoWars crew absolutely loves coffee because we love being awake.
[02:09:02.879 --> 02:09:05.540]  And I am somewhat of a connoisseur of coffee.
[02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:11.881]  So many times you go to a restaurant, or even to a coffee shop, and the coffee tastes like garbage.
[02:09:12.662 --> 02:09:25.025]  And in all the different coffees I've tried, my favorite is grown in the high mountains, in shade, Arabica, on the border with Guatemala, in southern Mexico, by the Chiapas farmers.
[02:09:25.445 --> 02:09:26.906]  I make sure we've done the research.
[02:09:27.246 --> 02:09:33.029]  I make sure it's the very best product that we can offer you when I put my name on it.
[02:09:33.369 --> 02:09:39.512]  And I believe, and it's my taste so you may differ, that this is the best coffee in the world from Southern Mexico.
[02:09:39.792 --> 02:09:43.494]  Wake of America Patriot Blend, 100% organic, Arabica shade grown.
[02:09:43.794 --> 02:09:52.838]  And then we have the Immune Support 100% organic coffee infused with a special type of mushroom known to boost the immunity.
[02:09:53.078 --> 02:09:55.559]  This coffee is seriously so smooth.
[02:09:55.699 --> 02:10:04.081]  I normally have to douse my coffee with cream and sugar and cinnamon and all kinds of tasty treats, but this, I drink this black.
[02:10:04.141 --> 02:10:05.001]  It is so good.
[02:10:05.621 --> 02:10:07.782]  Well, that's why I like it is that it has a kick.
[02:10:07.822 --> 02:10:09.482]  It has really good caffeine in it.
[02:10:09.862 --> 02:10:12.423]  It has a good clean wake up that lasts for a long time.
[02:10:12.463 --> 02:10:15.104]  Doesn't give me a headache, but it's so smooth.
[02:10:15.164 --> 02:10:16.064]  It's so delicious.
[02:10:16.484 --> 02:10:17.744]  Just try it out for yourself.
[02:10:17.824 --> 02:10:19.805]  I'm telling you, this is my favorite coffee.
[02:10:20.485 --> 02:10:22.306]  We went through a lot of trouble to bring you this.
[02:10:22.886 --> 02:10:27.228]  Just try it and I think you'll be hooked like we are here at InfoWars.
[02:10:27.328 --> 02:10:31.569]  Well folks, find out for yourself and support the information war today.
[02:10:31.929 --> 02:10:35.391]  It's all available at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:10:50.051 --> 02:10:53.755]  And let's dispel once and for all the suspicion that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing.
[02:10:53.775 --> 02:10:55.878]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[02:11:08.100 --> 02:11:14.625]  Welcome back to our live coverage, and for War is Nightly News, our live coverage of the final GOP debate before Super Tuesday.
[02:11:14.645 --> 02:11:21.009]  The question that we're dealing with right now, as we just come back from the break, they're asking everyone to declare their unwavering devotion to Israel.
[02:11:21.069 --> 02:11:24.412]  And so Trump was taking a neutral position.
[02:11:24.752 --> 02:11:30.576]  Now we're going to have Ted Cruz talk about how he would stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel.
[02:11:30.636 --> 02:11:37.621]  But they also keep saying, if you look at this on the bottom, say, how will Trump's view of this, blah, blah, blah, like how will you defeat Trump's view on Israel?
[02:11:37.921 --> 02:11:39.443]  All targeted towards Trump.
[02:11:39.463 --> 02:11:40.385]  It's all towards Trump.
[02:11:40.445 --> 02:11:44.951]  All the questions are for the other candidates about what they're going to do, about what Trump is saying.
[02:11:45.131 --> 02:11:47.294]  How can you attack Trump on this issue?
[02:11:47.314 --> 02:11:50.559]  It's all about showing how they are the alternative to Trump.
[02:11:50.799 --> 02:11:52.882]  Well, it's all about setting every question.
[02:11:53.783 --> 02:11:57.167]  Every question is, please critique Trump on fill in the blank.
[02:11:57.227 --> 02:12:02.994]  It's like their last effort to try and demonize this guy or do something to attack him.
[02:12:03.334 --> 02:12:04.055]  It's pretty ridiculous.
[02:12:04.095 --> 02:12:06.719]  All Trump's done is make both these guys look like clowns.
[02:12:07.099 --> 02:12:10.303]  And the only one that actually looks like a clown right now is Kasich with that bad eyeliner job.
[02:12:11.883 --> 02:12:15.466]  And it seems like Trump really is sort of ticked this time around.
[02:12:15.847 --> 02:12:22.492]  Normally he's kind of lackadaisical, but tonight he's getting a little... See, this is like the Hispanic question.
[02:12:22.553 --> 02:12:26.016]  It's like, what are you going to do for Hispanic people?
[02:12:26.056 --> 02:12:27.437]  What are you going to do for Jewish people?
[02:12:27.997 --> 02:12:34.261]  Why don't we put America's interests up first on a debate for the American president?
[02:12:34.281 --> 02:12:36.262]  I am sick of this.
[02:12:36.302 --> 02:12:37.022]  Sick of it.
[02:12:37.082 --> 02:12:42.045]  They're running for president of Israel or Mexico or what?
[02:12:42.105 --> 02:12:42.445]  Canada?
[02:12:42.705 --> 02:12:43.005]  I don't know.
[02:12:43.025 --> 02:12:43.306]  Yeah.
[02:12:43.326 --> 02:12:44.087]  Check your privilege.
[02:12:57.742 --> 02:12:58.222]  Checking it!
[02:13:28.062 --> 02:13:31.143]  He's going to do really good at pep rallies at a high school.
[02:13:31.163 --> 02:13:33.223]  That's where he says he's going.
[02:13:33.343 --> 02:13:36.844]  He's not really sure where his day's going to be, but maybe at his kid's school.
[02:13:37.684 --> 02:13:39.985]  Maybe he's going to be principal at that school.
[02:13:40.025 --> 02:13:45.606]  Rubio's got a massive nose hair and that's going to be a Twitter hashtag.
[02:13:45.686 --> 02:13:45.866]  Who?
[02:13:45.926 --> 02:13:49.507]  Rubio had a big massive nose hair on his left nostril.
[02:13:50.807 --> 02:13:51.867]  Look for it.
[02:13:51.947 --> 02:13:54.008]  That's what everybody's going to talk about.
[02:13:54.448 --> 02:13:55.148]  How do you even see that?
[02:13:55.168 --> 02:13:56.508]  We have a big screen in here.
[02:14:20.493 --> 02:14:21.454]  Israel comes first.
[02:14:21.534 --> 02:14:24.497]  You understand that if you want Sheldon Adelson's money.
[02:14:24.878 --> 02:14:30.423]  And of course, Marco Rubio is leading the Sheldon Adelson primary, followed closely by Ted Cruz.
[02:14:31.364 --> 02:14:34.027]  Sheldon Adelson, everybody's asking, where is his money this time?
[02:14:34.067 --> 02:14:36.369]  He put in $100 million last time.
[02:14:36.389 --> 02:14:37.670]  He hasn't put it down on anybody.
[02:14:37.730 --> 02:14:42.115]  I think he realizes that these two bozos don't stand a chance.
[02:14:44.887 --> 02:14:45.831]  I'm a negotiator.
[02:14:46.071 --> 02:14:48.981]  I've done very well over the years through negotiation.
[02:14:49.222 --> 02:14:50.587]  It's very important that we do that.
[02:14:51.454 --> 02:14:53.695]  In all fairness, Marco is not a negotiator.
[02:14:53.715 --> 02:14:55.976]  We're looking for signs of robotics.
[02:14:56.056 --> 02:15:01.199]  I think I just saw like a... He's gonna interrupt him again.
[02:15:01.319 --> 02:15:02.499]  That's been his technique all night.
[02:15:02.559 --> 02:15:05.080]  It's like, you know I got interrupted by Chris Christie?
[02:15:05.160 --> 02:15:08.002]  I'm gonna do that all night to Donald Trump.
[02:15:08.202 --> 02:15:11.843]  Yeah, that tactic really seemed to work.
[02:15:11.923 --> 02:15:14.665]  Instead of letting him finish his point, he's gotta fight with him, so...
[02:15:18.925 --> 02:15:21.527]  Here's Rubio earlier today.
[02:15:42.768 --> 02:15:44.829]  You raised it, Governor Kasich.
[02:15:45.209 --> 02:15:48.311]  The threat posed by North Korea to the United States and its allies.
[02:15:48.611 --> 02:15:59.178]  The commander of American forces in South Korea said the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un would use a weapon of mass destruction if he thought his regime was being threatened.
[02:15:59.478 --> 02:16:00.478]  Time for Team America.
[02:16:00.518 --> 02:16:06.762]  You have said the United States should start examining a strategy of regime change in North Korea.
[02:16:06.882 --> 02:16:07.723]  Let's be clear.
[02:16:08.323 --> 02:16:11.865]  Are you talking about getting rid of Kim Jong-un?
[02:16:11.945 --> 02:16:16.427]  When you talk about regime change, Wolf, it means that regime change.
[02:16:16.447 --> 02:16:17.027]  That's what it means.
[02:16:17.327 --> 02:16:19.628]  And you know, there's so much chaos in North Korea right now.
[02:16:19.709 --> 02:16:23.370]  If you're talking about regime change, I mean, that's regime change.
[02:16:23.450 --> 02:16:25.431]  Right, how are you going to... That's French for coup d'etat.
[02:16:25.451 --> 02:16:27.592]  You're talking about a nomination.
[02:16:27.732 --> 02:16:28.853]  It's a nomination.
[02:16:29.013 --> 02:16:30.774]  Well, you remember what Rubio said earlier.
[02:16:30.794 --> 02:16:32.815]  We don't get rid of people.
[02:16:32.835 --> 02:16:34.776]  We're not involved in regime change.
[02:16:35.376 --> 02:16:38.611]  Rubio said earlier, you know, you don't win the nomination by winning states.
[02:16:41.738 --> 02:16:47.860]  You win it by getting Wall Street backers who will steal the convention for you.
[02:16:47.980 --> 02:16:49.480]  Well, and that's what I was saying.
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:59.203]  I knew that this would be such a hotly contested thing that they were going to have to take it to a brokered convention where they can steal it then, at that point, like we were mentioning earlier.
[02:16:59.223 --> 02:17:04.524]  Where they can compete to join Reince Priebus.
[02:17:04.825 --> 02:17:05.645]  Join us.
[02:17:08.248 --> 02:17:09.069]  We're good.
[02:17:26.127 --> 02:17:26.587]  He's paddled in.
[02:17:26.607 --> 02:17:26.948]  That's frat.
[02:17:27.148 --> 02:17:27.668]  He's candid.
[02:17:27.748 --> 02:17:28.449]  Wolf has counted him.
[02:17:28.509 --> 02:17:29.129]  He's got him.
[02:17:29.169 --> 02:17:31.751]  I would talk to the experts and they would tell me what to do.
[02:17:55.888 --> 02:17:57.792]  When we're talking about Kim Chi, we're talking about Kim Chi.
[02:18:06.013 --> 02:18:07.753]  Smelly cabbage.
[02:18:07.814 --> 02:18:12.795]  I'm just like, why are we going into North Korea now for regime change?
[02:18:12.835 --> 02:18:18.336]  You know, like, they're already saying they need troops there in the safe zone in Syria.
[02:18:18.356 --> 02:18:22.057]  I already got to look at Hillary Clinton and the Kim Jong-un picture every day.
[02:18:22.077 --> 02:18:25.698]  I want to see him in the news every day wearing the same outfit all the time.
[02:18:25.718 --> 02:18:28.239]  Well, Hillary's got to go get her pantsuit somewhere.
[02:18:28.639 --> 02:18:30.080]  You see my pantsuit?
[02:18:30.100 --> 02:18:34.481]  We have the ballistic missile technology to defend ourselves.
[02:18:34.501 --> 02:18:34.801]  Mr. Trump.
[02:18:35.561 --> 02:18:49.085]  One thing I'd like to add to what the governor is saying, I think that we are now in a position, we owe $19 trillion, because of the horrible omnibus budget that was approved six weeks ago, it's going to be $21 trillion.
[02:18:49.625 --> 02:18:52.026]  We can no longer defend all of these countries.
[02:18:52.086 --> 02:18:58.868]  Japan, Germany, South Korea, you order televisions, you order almost anything, you're getting it from these countries.
[02:18:58.888 --> 02:19:02.989]  Whether it's a Mercedes Benz, or whether it's an air conditioning unit.
[02:19:03.029 --> 02:19:04.970]  We're paying nothing in return.
[02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:12.372]  35 years ago he paid $100,000 to say this in the New York Times.
[02:19:12.432 --> 02:19:14.652]  And this is exactly what he said 35 years ago.
[02:19:14.692 --> 02:19:16.233]  I think he agrees with it.
[02:19:16.353 --> 02:19:16.993]  I agree with this.
[02:19:17.033 --> 02:19:18.893]  We've heard this from Pat Buchanan and many other people.
[02:19:18.913 --> 02:19:21.534]  It's a populist, nationalist point of view.
[02:19:21.914 --> 02:19:25.635]  We don't need to be paying for the defense of all these countries like South Korea and others.
[02:19:27.276 --> 02:19:36.106]  Especially when we prop up their entire economy by being convinced every year that we need a new television, or a new car, a new phone.
[02:19:36.126 --> 02:19:37.548]  So we can prop up their economy.
[02:19:37.588 --> 02:19:39.110]  Meanwhile we're faltering, we have no jobs.
[02:19:43.414 --> 02:19:50.777]  We're the leader of the world, so suck up, you know, 21 trillion dollars, that's just the beginning.
[02:19:50.957 --> 02:19:51.997]  It never ends.
[02:19:52.077 --> 02:19:57.659]  Because one of the things he's saying, well let's make sure we got a defense system against these South Korean missiles.
[02:19:58.139 --> 02:20:01.460]  Because we're going to, you know, North Korean missiles.
[02:20:01.980 --> 02:20:08.703]  We sell all of these billions of dollars in weaponry to all these people that we then have to defend ourselves against.
[02:20:08.763 --> 02:20:10.063]  Oh, didn't see that one coming.
[02:20:10.083 --> 02:20:12.604]  We have to rebuild our military.
[02:20:14.297 --> 02:20:19.862]  Bill Clinton who went in and helped them build their nuclear reactors in North Korea.
[02:20:19.922 --> 02:20:31.432]  I mean it was something, I did a report on this a few years ago when I first got here where it's Clinton was helping North Korea and then he was like well we need to get in and see what you're doing in there and they're like no and we're seeing it again with Iran.
[02:20:32.192 --> 02:20:36.236]  Well when they want to talk about defense spending and all this other stuff just remember
[02:20:37.293 --> 02:20:38.594]  The new ships that they just put out.
[02:20:38.614 --> 02:20:39.394]  They had two ships.
[02:20:39.474 --> 02:20:41.875]  One of them broke down after 40 miles, okay?
[02:20:41.895 --> 02:20:45.597]  These stealth surface ships that were, I think, $360 million.
[02:20:45.617 --> 02:20:51.800]  We've got a new fighter jet that doesn't have any weapon systems that are capable of being fired from it.
[02:20:51.900 --> 02:20:54.982]  I mean, this is beyond boondoggle and waste.
[02:20:55.502 --> 02:21:01.925]  And part of the reason that we have these systems is because of this idiotic idea that we have to be the policemen of the world.
[02:21:01.945 --> 02:21:04.606]  And I'm glad to see Donald Trump pushing back on that.
[02:21:04.686 --> 02:21:05.867]  I wish the rest of these people would.
[02:21:06.247 --> 02:21:13.394]  But again, on that issue, like on managed trade, trade managed by foreign countries, there's nobody else that's taking up that issue besides him.
[02:21:13.474 --> 02:21:16.737]  And they won't find anything because I'm a very honest person.
[02:21:17.137 --> 02:21:21.722]  But the fact of the matter is the IRS is not honest and we need to get rid of them.
[02:21:21.842 --> 02:21:22.623]  Yep.
[02:21:22.843 --> 02:21:23.704]  Yep, good job.
[02:21:24.544 --> 02:21:24.865]  We're here.
[02:21:26.751 --> 02:21:27.492]  I like him.
[02:21:28.594 --> 02:21:29.715]  He needs to stay around.
[02:21:29.755 --> 02:21:31.678]  He makes sense a lot of the time.
[02:21:31.718 --> 02:21:35.503]  He wants to give you those forced vaccinations.
[02:21:35.523 --> 02:21:40.129]  I actually have a clip that Richard, we haven't even put it out yet, Richard asked him about that.
[02:21:41.110 --> 02:21:46.454]  Some vaccinations should be mandatory if there's an outbreak.
[02:21:46.494 --> 02:21:50.618]  But others, he thinks they should be, you know, you can choose to have them.
[02:21:50.658 --> 02:21:51.758]  He's sort of on the fence.
[02:21:51.778 --> 02:21:56.822]  Well, let me tell you, anybody... If they're going to cause an outbreak with their patented virus, then it's mandated.
[02:21:56.842 --> 02:21:57.543]  Yeah, Zika.
[02:21:57.583 --> 02:21:58.584]  Everybody get a Zika.
[02:21:58.884 --> 02:22:03.628]  Anybody that defends the war on drugs has absolutely no interest in informed consent.
[02:22:04.168 --> 02:22:31.304]  Anybody that supports the FDA has no interest in informed consent because the FDA was set up to shut that down I mean if you're if you want to take pharmaceuticals from the You're not allowed until the FDA says it's allowed so everything is prohibited unless expressly permitted That's an inversion of what our Constitution says And and anybody that supports war on drugs anybody supports the FDA so that they don't they don't support your informed consent So of course they're gonna do mandatory things to you
[02:22:31.687 --> 02:22:32.407]  Thank you, thank you.
[02:23:00.188 --> 02:23:00.428]  Yeah.
[02:23:01.069 --> 02:23:02.110]  We're helpless at this point.
[02:23:02.790 --> 02:23:04.012]  You guys didn't realize that.
[02:23:04.032 --> 02:23:07.755]  You didn't realize that the entire military disappeared in the last couple of years.
[02:23:07.775 --> 02:23:11.338]  We don't have ships that are grounding themselves and planes that can't carry weapons.
[02:23:12.459 --> 02:23:14.021]  Until 2022, we are helpless.
[02:23:14.141 --> 02:23:16.063]  We just have drones that bomb families.
[02:23:16.543 --> 02:23:21.146]  If we are defenseless at home, it's because we've sent our military to every other country in the world.
[02:23:21.306 --> 02:23:22.587]  Or we've confiscated all the guns.
[02:23:22.747 --> 02:23:23.007]  Yeah.
[02:23:23.308 --> 02:23:31.613]  And because we are arming ISIS and because the weapon systems, the new weapon systems that we're building are not built for our defense, they're built to enrich the military industrial complex.
[02:23:31.653 --> 02:23:45.141]  Right, and we've spent so much money on these weapons that are obsolete as soon as they hit the ground, and yet nothing on the infrastructure and trying to get everything signed up to the Internet of Things with back doors built into them.
[02:23:45.561 --> 02:23:51.905]  That's going to be the future of warfare, and as we can see, because the government keeps getting hacked into with all their personal information.
[02:23:51.925 --> 02:23:52.685]  Well, we got good weapons.
[02:23:52.705 --> 02:23:54.086]  We just have weak Americans now.
[02:23:54.366 --> 02:23:58.971]  Well we just don't, there's nothing that is protecting us in that sense.
[02:23:59.352 --> 02:24:02.496]  You know, there's a huge weakness here in America because of that.
[02:24:02.556 --> 02:24:04.598]  And then they just want us to give up our encryption.
[02:24:04.618 --> 02:24:12.928]  One of the real challenges with both Donald and Senator Rubio is that they have agreed over and over again with both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
[02:24:12.948 --> 02:24:14.109]  So for example in Libya.
[02:24:15.060 --> 02:24:19.047]  Both of them agreed with the Obama-Clinton policy of toppling the government in Libya.
[02:24:19.388 --> 02:24:20.410]  That was a disaster.
[02:24:20.450 --> 02:24:25.438]  It gave the country over to radical Islamic terrorism and it endangered America.
[02:24:25.859 --> 02:24:27.362]  Another example is John Kerry.
[02:24:28.416 --> 02:24:31.900]  John Kerry, Senator Rubio, voted to confirm John Kerry as Secretary of State.
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:44.014]  I voted against him, and Donald Trump supported John Kerry against George W. Bush in 2004, gave him a check, and John Kerry has been the most anti-Israel Secretary of State this country has ever seen.
[02:24:44.794 --> 02:24:47.077]  His diplomacy has been a disaster.
[02:24:47.097 --> 02:24:48.579]  Why are we talking about Israel?
[02:24:48.979 --> 02:24:49.239]  Yeah.
[02:24:49.479 --> 02:24:50.960]  Yeah, he doesn't support Israel enough.
[02:24:50.980 --> 02:24:51.661]  And it's like, you know what?
[02:24:51.701 --> 02:24:52.281]  We're Americans.
[02:24:52.301 --> 02:24:53.982]  We don't even support our own country enough right now.
[02:24:54.002 --> 02:24:55.143]  Here's what we did to Libya.
[02:24:55.283 --> 02:24:57.745]  Look at this.
[02:24:57.765 --> 02:24:57.745]  2007.
[02:24:58.846 --> 02:25:00.046]  People driving down the streets.
[02:25:00.767 --> 02:25:01.928]  Going to restaurants.
[02:25:02.468 --> 02:25:04.990]  Getting their free houses from Qaddafi.
[02:25:05.330 --> 02:25:04.990]  2011.
[02:25:05.490 --> 02:25:07.511]  Thanks to We Came, We Saw, He Died.
[02:25:08.272 --> 02:25:09.052]  Hillary Clinton.
[02:25:09.092 --> 02:25:09.993]  This is what we're looking at.
[02:25:10.133 --> 02:25:11.874]  Yeah, Iraq looks like that.
[02:25:11.894 --> 02:25:13.896]  The whole entire Middle East is like that.
[02:25:14.056 --> 02:25:17.058]  When we go and bring democracy... This is giving people freedom!
[02:25:17.178 --> 02:25:18.539]  We bring democracy to their country.
[02:25:18.939 --> 02:25:19.439]  Freedom!
[02:25:19.719 --> 02:25:20.719]  How about we left Libya alone?
[02:25:20.739 --> 02:25:20.819]  Yeah.
[02:25:20.879 --> 02:25:23.880]  And have Qaddafi be a firewall against ISIS?
[02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:25.060]  Oh no, that wouldn't work.
[02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:27.321]  We couldn't have that because the plan is to bring ISIS into
[02:25:45.165 --> 02:25:45.305]  Yeah.
[02:25:45.325 --> 02:25:45.405]  Yeah.
[02:25:45.445 --> 02:25:45.625]  Yeah.
[02:25:45.665 --> 02:25:45.826]  Yeah.
[02:25:45.866 --> 02:25:45.966]  Yeah.
[02:25:45.986 --> 02:25:46.086]  Yeah.
[02:26:09.445 --> 02:26:09.805]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:26:09.825 --> 02:26:10.446]  And as Trump just pointed out,
[02:26:28.307 --> 02:26:36.151]  We're better off there with Qaddafi in charge than we are now in the chaos that we have created, the power vacuum that we have created.
[02:26:36.171 --> 02:26:38.892]  But of course, that is the purpose.
[02:26:39.132 --> 02:26:40.173]  It wasn't a mistake.
[02:26:40.753 --> 02:26:42.014]  They want that kind of chaos.
[02:26:42.034 --> 02:26:42.514]  There he is.
[02:26:42.634 --> 02:26:46.556]  Like, what leader in our country could drive around like that?
[02:26:46.836 --> 02:26:49.137]  Oh yeah, that's true.
[02:26:49.177 --> 02:26:50.798]  That's a good point.
[02:26:50.838 --> 02:26:52.159]  And these people have guns.
[02:26:52.179 --> 02:26:52.899]  They could have shot him.
[02:26:53.079 --> 02:26:54.500]  Nobody was shooting this guy because
[02:26:55.380 --> 02:27:04.946]  You know, that is actually kind of what a socialist utopia could be like if you had large natural resources that you were able to redistribute back to the people.
[02:27:04.966 --> 02:27:05.946]  You could see something like this.
[02:27:06.166 --> 02:27:09.408]  I think our country is too big for that to happen.
[02:27:09.528 --> 02:27:13.751]  And it dissentifies people from actually working.
[02:27:13.931 --> 02:27:18.393]  Well, the robots are going to be doing all the work here soon anyway.
[02:27:21.355 --> 02:27:21.715]  A lot.
[02:27:21.935 --> 02:27:24.456]  I'll negotiate a lot more money than you'll ever get.
[02:27:26.156 --> 02:27:29.117]  He's never even talked about getting them to pay more money.
[02:27:29.797 --> 02:27:39.019]  I think he negotiated one of the worst deals in the history of our country, the Iran deal, where they get their $150 billion and all of the other things that take place.
[02:27:39.439 --> 02:27:44.480]  It is a disaster for this country, and speaking of Israel, it's a disaster for Israel.
[02:27:44.940 --> 02:27:46.401]  I'm no fan of John Kerry.
[02:27:46.581 --> 02:27:47.581]  Hold on, hold on, Governor.
[02:27:47.601 --> 02:27:48.161]  Senator Cruz.
[02:27:49.195 --> 02:27:49.975]  You know, it's interesting.
[02:27:50.035 --> 02:27:53.997]  Donald just said that he never came out in favor of toppling Gaddafi in Libya.
[02:27:54.257 --> 02:27:58.218]  Well, he stated that in an interview that will be on our website, TedCruz.org.
[02:27:58.238 --> 02:28:03.280]  You can see and hear the exact words from Donald's mouth, and I assume when he sees that... Just make a $5 contribution.
[02:28:03.320 --> 02:28:03.520]  Get it.
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:07.762]  ...that I assume Donald will apologize where he sees that he said exactly that.
[02:28:08.442 --> 02:28:12.828]  With regard to John Kerry, I will say John Kerry's foreign policy has been a disaster for decades.
[02:28:12.848 --> 02:28:15.431]  That's why I voted against him when he came up.
[02:28:15.491 --> 02:28:23.021]  And the fact that Donald Trump would write him a check and support him against George W. Bush shows exceptionally poor foreign policy judgment.
[02:28:23.401 --> 02:28:24.843]  And I'll give one more example in Israel.
[02:28:25.484 --> 02:28:35.252]  When the Obama administration cancelled civilian air flights into the nation of Israel, when Hamas was raining rockets down on them, I publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against Israel?
[02:28:35.692 --> 02:28:41.857]  The next day, Michael Bloomberg, another New York billionaire, got on a plane, a commercial flight, and flew to Israel from London.
[02:28:42.217 --> 02:28:49.863]  Together, the heat and light that was put on the State Department was so great that within 36 hours, they lifted the ban on air flights
[02:28:50.123 --> 02:28:53.425]  So he likes Bloomberg like Rupert Murdoch likes Bloomberg.
[02:28:53.465 --> 02:28:54.786]  Yeah, Bloomberg's great.
[02:28:54.806 --> 02:28:57.007]  Maybe you should get out of the way and let Bloomberg run.
[02:28:57.147 --> 02:29:01.230]  Actually, I think he was funny born in America, instead of Canada.
[02:29:02.110 --> 02:29:03.751]  He might actually be eligible.
[02:29:03.772 --> 02:29:04.212]  Yeah.
[02:29:04.292 --> 02:29:06.793]  Well, why are you supporting a gun-grabbing billionaire?
[02:29:06.813 --> 02:29:07.514]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:29:07.594 --> 02:29:09.795]  Oh, because Israel.
[02:29:10.256 --> 02:29:11.056]  Because Israel.
[02:29:11.116 --> 02:29:12.137]  That's the only reason, yeah.
[02:29:12.177 --> 02:29:13.718]  I'll take your gun for Israel.
[02:29:13.798 --> 02:29:14.018]  Yeah.
[02:29:15.471 --> 02:29:18.873]  Oh boy.
[02:29:18.913 --> 02:29:22.855]  Governor, Governor, he attacked, he attacked Mr. Trump.
[02:29:23.135 --> 02:29:24.896]  Mr. Trump has a right to respond.
[02:29:25.496 --> 02:29:27.217]  My response is very simple.
[02:29:27.237 --> 02:29:31.319]  There is nobody on this stage that has done more for Israel than I have.
[02:29:31.880 --> 02:29:32.280]  Nobody.
[02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:36.322]  You might say, you might talk, your politicians all talk, no action.
[02:29:36.602 --> 02:29:38.903]  I've been watching it all my life.
[02:29:38.923 --> 02:29:41.004]  You are all talk and no action.
[02:29:41.064 --> 02:29:42.365]  What I've seen up here
[02:29:42.845 --> 02:29:45.767]  I mean, first of all, this guy's a choke artist, and this guy's a liar.
[02:29:46.047 --> 02:29:46.968]  You have a combination of facts.
[02:29:46.988 --> 02:29:47.469]  That was awesome.
[02:29:47.509 --> 02:29:47.849]  A what artist?
[02:29:47.949 --> 02:29:48.309]  A choke artist?
[02:29:48.329 --> 02:29:50.251]  He says, this guy's a choke artist, and you're a liar.
[02:29:50.271 --> 02:29:51.211]  I don't know what a choke artist is.
[02:29:51.231 --> 02:29:52.272]  Other than that, I rest my case.
[02:29:52.292 --> 02:29:53.433]  This is a typical... Oh, okay.
[02:29:53.453 --> 02:29:54.434]  Governor Kasich, you have the floor.
[02:29:54.474 --> 02:29:55.354]  Governor Kasich, you have the floor.
[02:29:55.374 --> 02:29:56.495]  Governor Kasich, you have the floor.
[02:29:56.515 --> 02:29:57.496]  Governor Kasich, you have the floor.
[02:29:57.516 --> 02:29:58.317]  Governor Kasich, you have the floor.
[02:29:58.337 --> 02:29:59.237]  Governor Kasich, you have the floor.
[02:29:59.257 --> 02:29:59.998]  Governor Kasich, you have the floor.
[02:30:00.018 --> 02:30:00.818]  Governor Kasich, you have the floor.
[02:30:00.838 --> 02:30:01.719]  Governor Kasich, you have the floor.
[02:30:01.759 --> 02:30:02.680]  Governor Kasich, you have the floor.
[02:30:02.700 --> 02:30:03.560]  Governor Kasich, you have the floor.
[02:30:03.580 --> 02:30:04.541]  Governor Kasich, you have the floor.
[02:30:04.561 --> 02:30:05.602]  Governor Kasich, you have the floor.
[02:30:05.622 --> 02:30:06.783]  Governor Kasich, you have the floor.
[02:30:06.803 --> 02:30:07.764]  Governor Kasich, you have the floor.
[02:30:07.824 --> 02:30:08.324]  Governor Kasich, you
[02:30:08.844 --> 02:30:17.932]  Can somebody attack me please?
[02:30:18.372 --> 02:30:20.874]  Can somebody attack me please?
[02:30:21.154 --> 02:30:23.376]  I want to be able to say something.
[02:30:23.716 --> 02:30:31.723]  It's so critically important about how the Obama administration has really done such a ridiculous job here in foreign policy.
[02:30:31.803 --> 02:30:35.066]  First of all, we should have been supporting the rebels long ago.
[02:30:35.686 --> 02:30:41.769]  They could have taken Assad out, and because we did nothing, the Russians are now in, and they're sitting in the cat burrow.
[02:30:41.789 --> 02:30:43.370]  He just said support Al-Qaeda.
[02:30:43.430 --> 02:30:44.311]  He just admitted it.
[02:30:44.351 --> 02:30:45.751]  That's what we should have done.
[02:30:45.811 --> 02:30:47.172]  He's in the John McCain camp.
[02:30:47.252 --> 02:30:49.614]  You're not crying, it's the mascara on his eye.
[02:30:52.635 --> 02:30:55.298]  Libya didn't go down because it was some people revolution.
[02:30:55.578 --> 02:31:00.963]  Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power, and all these other people convinced the president to undermine Gaddafi.
[02:31:01.264 --> 02:31:04.847]  They undermined him and now they have created a cesspool in Libya.
[02:31:05.007 --> 02:31:10.413]  It's true, Hillary Clinton doesn't want to take credit for it now, but it was only because of her and all of her connections.
[02:31:13.221 --> 02:31:14.522]  She made that happen.
[02:31:14.762 --> 02:31:16.764]  It's mostly it's desert, but it's a problem.
[02:31:17.144 --> 02:31:21.167]  Then we have ISIS in Syria and we have ISIS in Iraq.
[02:31:21.347 --> 02:31:24.549]  And we should have sided with ISIS.
[02:31:24.689 --> 02:31:26.931]  As you pointed out, Rob, we should have sided with ISIS.
[02:31:27.091 --> 02:31:28.692]  You should have just mentioned that earlier.
[02:31:28.772 --> 02:31:33.836]  Yeah, we could have created instability in Syria like we've done in Libya.
[02:31:33.856 --> 02:31:36.017]  We could have already had that instability by now.
[02:31:36.277 --> 02:31:36.838]  And Iraq.
[02:31:40.111 --> 02:31:40.571]  We're good to go.
[02:31:56.398 --> 02:32:05.203]  Is actually the pattern of Washington, the pattern of Washington dealmakers, which is they make a lie, they break their words, and then when anyone calls them on it, they call you a liar.
[02:32:05.243 --> 02:32:06.964]  And so that's Donald's pattern over and over.
[02:32:06.984 --> 02:32:13.307]  And he said, for example, seven months ago, this is Donald speaking, quote, I, Donald Trump, was a member of the establishment.
[02:32:13.627 --> 02:32:17.010]  There's a reason Harry Reid thinks he's the best Republican up here.
[02:32:17.030 --> 02:32:32.224]  There's a reason Jimmy Carter said he would support Donald Trump over me, because he said Donald Trump is malleable, he has no fixed set of beliefs, whereas Ted Cruz is not malleable, and every time anyone points at Donald's actual record... Did he just talk about himself on third person?
[02:32:32.484 --> 02:32:33.745]  Donald yells liar.
[02:32:33.986 --> 02:32:39.871]  Let me tell you something, falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie, and it's something Donald does daily.
[02:32:40.151 --> 02:32:44.373]  Telling somebody that your opponent just dropped out of the race as the caucus is beginning.
[02:32:44.613 --> 02:32:46.354]  That's also lying, I think, isn't it?
[02:32:46.554 --> 02:32:54.158]  Well, I guess the lie of omission, of not letting people know you have a... Especially attacking your Christian opponent so you can get the Christian vote by lying.
[02:32:54.618 --> 02:32:54.898]  That was the...
[02:32:57.259 --> 02:32:58.219]  There we go.
[02:32:58.299 --> 02:32:58.800]  It's despicable.
[02:32:58.820 --> 02:32:59.600]  It's despicable.
[02:33:22.108 --> 02:33:22.949]  Do her best!
[02:33:23.009 --> 02:33:24.570]  The best of her ability.
[02:33:24.610 --> 02:33:25.811]  Try to level with the Americans.
[02:33:25.831 --> 02:33:27.972]  Try to level with the American public.
[02:33:28.012 --> 02:33:29.913]  Look at Ted.
[02:33:30.713 --> 02:33:33.095]  He's getting agitated.
[02:33:33.115 --> 02:33:35.056]  He's going to start speaking Spanish in a minute.
[02:33:35.096 --> 02:33:37.077]  I tell you, it's going to come out.
[02:33:37.177 --> 02:33:37.638]  Or Canadian.
[02:33:38.158 --> 02:33:38.678]  Or Canadian.
[02:33:38.918 --> 02:33:39.599]  Yeah, hey, hey!
[02:33:41.428 --> 02:33:42.629]  I gave him my check.
[02:33:42.649 --> 02:33:42.869]  His mouth.
[02:34:04.884 --> 02:34:05.525]  Donald claims to care... Too late.
[02:34:05.545 --> 02:34:07.466]  Donald, Donald, Donald, I understand the rules are very hard for you, they're very confusing.
[02:34:07.486 --> 02:34:22.858]  Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald
[02:34:22.978 --> 02:34:24.519]  I can't even deal with it.
[02:34:24.619 --> 02:34:25.360]  Thank you for the book.
[02:34:25.380 --> 02:34:25.981]  I really appreciate it.
[02:34:26.021 --> 02:34:26.721]  Donald, Donald relax.
[02:34:26.741 --> 02:34:27.142]  Go ahead.
[02:34:27.222 --> 02:34:27.742]  I'm relaxed.
[02:34:28.202 --> 02:34:30.865]  The Maltesers aren't even trying to see how that is.
[02:34:30.885 --> 02:34:33.027]  He said you're a basket case to Cruz.
[02:34:33.447 --> 02:34:38.972]  My name is... I promise you Donald, there is nothing about seeing you that makes anyone nervous.
[02:34:39.012 --> 02:34:40.693]  You lose people so badly watching this.
[02:34:40.753 --> 02:34:41.834]  Oh my God.
[02:34:41.874 --> 02:34:42.815]  Gentlemen, gentlemen.
[02:34:42.835 --> 02:34:44.576]  Wolf, I'm going to ask that my time is up.
[02:34:44.736 --> 02:34:45.817]  Wolf, take control.
[02:34:45.857 --> 02:34:46.097]  Wolf.
[02:34:48.198 --> 02:34:51.679]  This happened when I worked at CNN Debate one time.
[02:34:51.699 --> 02:34:54.480]  It was Clinton and Obama.
[02:34:55.080 --> 02:34:58.521]  And at one point they kept the shot up, the shot up between the two.
[02:34:58.901 --> 02:34:59.841]  They kept it up forever.
[02:35:00.141 --> 02:35:00.801]  Three minutes.
[02:35:00.881 --> 02:35:02.982]  It was like the longest shot they'd ever held in the debate.
[02:35:03.682 --> 02:35:06.183]  And we're all listening on the headset like, when are they going to change shots?
[02:35:06.203 --> 02:35:07.063]  When are they going to change shots?
[02:35:07.183 --> 02:35:09.764]  They kept the shot because they were waiting for something to happen.
[02:35:09.784 --> 02:35:10.984]  That's what they were doing right there.
[02:35:13.919 --> 02:35:18.360]  There's a huge battle underway right now between the tech giant Apple and the federal government.
[02:35:18.380 --> 02:35:23.562]  The federal government wants Apple to unlock the phone used by that... You know what Rubio's gonna say?
[02:35:23.682 --> 02:35:28.423]  That he should do whatever the federal government says.
[02:35:28.503 --> 02:35:32.024]  It'll be interesting to see if there's any difference on any of these guys on this issue.
[02:35:32.064 --> 02:35:32.164]  Yeah.
[02:35:33.244 --> 02:35:41.867]  And of course, as he's laying out the condition, let's let everybody know, Apple is requiring, the feds are requiring Apple to create something that doesn't exist.
[02:35:42.847 --> 02:35:45.428]  And, as John McAfee has pointed out, you can get into that.
[02:35:45.528 --> 02:35:52.790]  They're trying to establish a legal precedent to get into everybody's phones legally, because they're already doing it illegally because they don't respect the Constitution.
[02:35:52.930 --> 02:35:53.150]  Alexia.
[02:36:09.008 --> 02:36:09.348]  I called it!
[02:36:09.408 --> 02:36:09.508]  What?
[02:36:28.275 --> 02:36:33.777]  Ample should bend over for the FBI, lift up their trousers and let them do what they want.
[02:36:33.857 --> 02:36:37.738]  A TSA buddy cavity search is what they need.
[02:36:37.778 --> 02:36:38.518]  You're right about that.
[02:36:38.538 --> 02:36:41.780]  That's why the establishment likes him is because he's Mr. Security State.
[02:36:41.820 --> 02:36:42.520]  Mr. Surveillance State.
[02:36:45.441 --> 02:36:47.502]  They're asking them to create a new operating system.
[02:37:09.423 --> 02:37:11.465]  Our brand is the 4th Amendment of the Constitution.
[02:37:11.505 --> 02:37:12.947]  Yeah, he didn't care about it.
[02:37:13.607 --> 02:37:14.388]  He didn't care about it.
[02:37:14.808 --> 02:37:17.131]  Apple CEO Tim Cook says this would be bad for America.
[02:37:17.171 --> 02:37:19.293]  Let us not believe this myth in the 4th Amendment.
[02:37:19.373 --> 02:37:20.874]  The 4th Amendment doesn't exist.
[02:37:21.335 --> 02:37:21.815]  You know what?
[02:37:22.256 --> 02:37:33.267]  The FBI can tell us that they need to get into our phones, they can make demands on Apple when they indict and convict Hillary Clinton for violating security regulations for 1,700 classified emails plus
[02:37:33.507 --> 02:37:36.288]  Or when they stop propagating terror attacks, too.
[02:37:36.328 --> 02:37:37.489]  That's another thing they like to do.
[02:37:37.829 --> 02:37:38.289]  Exactly.
[02:37:38.510 --> 02:37:48.775]  You think that the San Bernardino shooter's phone is more important to our national security than Hillary Clinton's private email that's got all of her State Department stuff as Secretary of State?
[02:37:49.035 --> 02:37:54.598]  One of the number one targets of any intelligence or criminal organization would be the Secretary of State?
[02:37:54.898 --> 02:37:55.679]  Give me a break.
[02:37:55.979 --> 02:38:00.241]  If they're not going to do that, then they need to shut up about their security state.
[02:38:00.441 --> 02:38:04.964]  They need to shut up about national security because it's directed against nothing but us.
[02:38:04.984 --> 02:38:05.284]  Right.
[02:38:05.324 --> 02:38:06.225]  It's not for them.
[02:38:06.325 --> 02:38:07.725]  It's not about our security.
[02:38:07.785 --> 02:38:09.987]  It's not even about the government's security.
[02:38:10.207 --> 02:38:14.209]  They can't even protect their own employees' data records.
[02:38:14.249 --> 02:38:21.074]  They got hacked, major hacked, of all their employees and yet they want access to all of our information now.
[02:38:21.974 --> 02:38:22.815]  Not gonna happen.
[02:38:22.955 --> 02:38:23.955]  Yeah.
[02:38:24.095 --> 02:38:26.537]  Because it'll be the end of Apple if this happens.
[02:38:27.960 --> 02:38:30.041]  Nobody's going to want that product.
[02:38:30.101 --> 02:38:35.363]  Nobody in other countries is going to want the product that the American government can get into with a special backdoor.
[02:38:35.483 --> 02:38:38.965]  And it is about the future because this does set a precedent.
[02:38:39.005 --> 02:38:43.547]  There are, I mean, computer technology is very young.
[02:38:43.907 --> 02:38:48.108]  We have no idea what the future holds as far as technology that's out there.
[02:38:48.128 --> 02:38:49.809]  So this absolutely sets a precedent.
[02:38:50.149 --> 02:38:54.811]  Can the government compel tech companies to create things in order for them to violate
[02:38:55.011 --> 02:38:57.837]  If they don't comply with that you're encouraging chaos in our system.
[02:39:03.786 --> 02:39:11.092]  See, this is why I said, when it comes to the Constitution, when it comes to civil liberties, none of these guys respect it.
[02:39:11.112 --> 02:39:12.393]  None of these guys.
[02:39:12.433 --> 02:39:15.535]  Donald Trump was wrong on this issue, but none of these guys respect it.
[02:39:15.716 --> 02:39:16.696]  They're all wrong on the issue.
[02:39:16.716 --> 02:39:20.620]  You sit down in a back room and you sit down with the parties and you get this worked out.
[02:39:20.660 --> 02:39:28.426]  You don't litigate this on the front page of the New York Times, where everybody in the world is reading about their dirty laundry out here.
[02:39:28.446 --> 02:39:32.229]  It's because this is about establishing a legal precedent.
[02:39:32.329 --> 02:39:33.450]  And that's what Tim Cook was saying.
[02:39:33.870 --> 02:39:38.193]  Why did we learn about this in the press instead of with a meeting with the FBI director?
[02:39:38.233 --> 02:39:39.454]  So Kasich is right about that.
[02:39:39.634 --> 02:39:46.018]  They did it because this is all part of a strong-arm process to establish a legal precedent.
[02:39:46.058 --> 02:39:51.302]  To make Americans say, yeah, it's okay if you want to get on our phones to stop terrorism.
[02:39:51.582 --> 02:39:54.124]  This is exactly what we saw after 9-11.
[02:39:54.544 --> 02:39:57.927]  Sort of the same deal where people were willing to give up their rights
[02:39:58.727 --> 02:39:59.828]  In the name of security.
[02:40:00.088 --> 02:40:02.910]  And then it just kept on creeping and creeping and creeping.
[02:40:03.310 --> 02:40:05.931]  And that's the exact same thing that's going to happen with this phone.
[02:40:05.991 --> 02:40:06.772]  It's just the beginning.
[02:40:07.092 --> 02:40:12.555]  Then it's going to be your iPad, your computer, your car, your home, your coffee maker.
[02:40:12.595 --> 02:40:21.861]  Well you guys know the Libertarian candidate John Maxie has volunteered to crack the iPhone in a way that he says won't compromise Apple's security.
[02:40:21.901 --> 02:40:25.403]  It would just allow for that particular phone to be accessed.
[02:40:25.763 --> 02:40:30.485]  And he's illustrating with that, Jakari, that they don't need to do this.
[02:40:31.906 --> 02:40:32.626]  And that's the point.
[02:40:32.666 --> 02:40:40.069]  I think John McAfee made that offer to illustrate this is an effort, first and foremost, to set a legal precedent.
[02:40:40.109 --> 02:40:45.071]  There are technical ways you can get this information, but the FBI, and as John Kasich just pointed out,
[02:40:46.171 --> 02:40:50.435]  Apple learns about this when the FBI does a press release about it, saying we're going to do this or that.
[02:40:50.476 --> 02:40:56.501]  So it's all about them trying to make their spying on every American legal.
[02:40:56.781 --> 02:40:56.942]  Right.
[02:40:57.442 --> 02:41:00.125]  Yes, because we see that it wasn't just the phone.
[02:41:00.145 --> 02:41:01.886]  They had many other phones lined up.
[02:41:02.026 --> 02:41:02.287]  Yes.
[02:41:02.487 --> 02:41:06.851]  Well, since you already got the gear out, why don't you crack all these other phones for us?
[02:41:06.871 --> 02:41:07.912]  Why don't you do everybody?
[02:41:08.092 --> 02:41:08.412]  Yeah.
[02:41:08.452 --> 02:41:08.633]  Right.
[02:41:08.753 --> 02:41:09.694]  And that's what they keep saying.
[02:41:11.355 --> 02:41:12.556]  Just this one phone.
[02:41:12.596 --> 02:41:13.776]  We won't ask you for anything.
[02:41:13.796 --> 02:41:19.898]  And that's so... Even when they say it in front of the Congress, he can't... He's like, it's just this simple.
[02:41:19.978 --> 02:41:21.099]  It's just this one phone.
[02:41:21.119 --> 02:41:25.841]  Yeah, and that's another reason why I really don't like Rubio and when he's talking about this stuff.
[02:41:25.881 --> 02:41:26.801]  And he's not the only one.
[02:41:26.841 --> 02:41:29.802]  A lot of people think that the phone should have been broken open.
[02:41:29.842 --> 02:41:30.902]  I believe Trump as well.
[02:41:31.363 --> 02:41:34.084]  So that's just something that doesn't sit well with me at all.
[02:41:34.444 --> 02:41:35.164]  No, no, no.
[02:41:35.184 --> 02:41:37.385]  Yeah, there's not any of them on the right side of this.
[02:41:37.765 --> 02:41:38.827]  This is an interesting question.
[02:41:38.887 --> 02:41:43.293]  The Telemundo reporter asks, why do you think we need to build a wall at the Mexican border but not at the Canadian border?
[02:41:43.553 --> 02:41:47.819]  We could have kept Cruz out if we had done that.
[02:41:47.839 --> 02:41:48.380]  Too late!
[02:41:48.540 --> 02:41:49.081]  Too late!
[02:41:51.735 --> 02:41:52.355]  Yeah.
[02:41:52.715 --> 02:41:58.816]  I don't think we have a massive influx of Canadians coming into America illegally, do we?
[02:41:59.097 --> 02:41:59.277]  No.
[02:41:59.297 --> 02:42:00.077]  I hadn't noticed that.
[02:42:00.457 --> 02:42:01.957]  Maybe she hadn't noticed that either.
[02:42:01.977 --> 02:42:04.238]  We have Americans trying to force the border into Canada.
[02:42:04.318 --> 02:42:04.538]  Yeah.
[02:42:04.578 --> 02:42:15.480]  Yeah, like I said, I'm not a fan of the wall, but I think it is rather notable that, you know, they have walls at the Vatican, but if you build a wall on the border, then there's something wrong with that.
[02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:16.701]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:42:16.741 --> 02:42:20.025]  Like I said, Mexico is trying to build a wall on the southern border.
[02:42:20.085 --> 02:42:21.907]  And the Canadian president looks like Donald Trump.
[02:42:25.486 --> 02:42:26.486]  Unless they do something dirty.
[02:42:26.506 --> 02:42:26.846]  Sure.
[02:42:48.951 --> 02:42:53.074]  Because bankruptcy doesn't work unless you change the way you're operating or you're going to be bankrupt again.
[02:42:53.094 --> 02:42:55.916]  And the problem with Puerto Rico is its economy is not growing.
[02:42:55.936 --> 02:43:01.299]  It has a massive exodus of professionals and others that are leaving to my home state of Florida and all over the country.
[02:43:01.319 --> 02:43:05.082]  They're coming to the mainland from Puerto Rico because the economy there is not growing.
[02:43:05.122 --> 02:43:06.603]  It's too expensive to do business here.
[02:43:06.863 --> 02:43:09.085]  Bernie Sanders is going to change all that.
[02:43:09.165 --> 02:43:10.285]  Everybody's tax rate will be high.
[02:43:10.305 --> 02:43:10.806]  Yes we will.
[02:43:23.374 --> 02:43:31.461]  If the economy in Puerto Rico does not grow, they will never generate the revenue to pay this debt, or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that they have on the stock market.
[02:43:31.481 --> 02:43:32.282]  He's right on this issue.
[02:43:32.322 --> 02:43:38.147]  And again, why is it that the Telemundo person is focusing on bankruptcy for Puerto Rico?
[02:43:38.188 --> 02:43:41.110]  I mean, is that really something that is an issue in the American election?
[02:43:41.150 --> 02:43:46.135]  I mean, why, you know, we can't talk... Hey, they're like the 51st state or something.
[02:43:46.175 --> 02:43:48.397]  Yeah, but I mean, you know, let's talk about...
[02:43:48.877 --> 02:43:59.205]  You know, civil asset forfeiture is some real issue that affects all Americans instead of some narrow issue that focuses simply on Hispanic people.
[02:43:59.265 --> 02:44:02.848]  That's what I disagree with this Telemundo person.

[02:47:07.617 --> 02:47:08.639]  Brain Force is here.
[02:47:09.180 --> 02:47:11.463]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:47:11.744 --> 02:47:19.576]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[02:47:20.359 --> 02:47:23.961]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[02:47:23.981 --> 02:47:26.323]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:47:26.703 --> 02:47:30.326]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:47:30.366 --> 02:47:33.408]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:47:33.928 --> 02:47:38.751]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:47:39.272 --> 02:47:41.113]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[02:47:41.473 --> 02:47:45.916]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:47:46.076 --> 02:47:48.098]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:47:48.718 --> 02:47:50.199]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:47:50.339 --> 02:47:50.579]  Exactly.
[02:47:50.599 --> 02:47:54.402]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:47:54.902 --> 02:48:02.928]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:48:09.128 --> 02:48:12.530]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:48:12.891 --> 02:48:20.035]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:48:20.636 --> 02:48:29.001]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:48:29.242 --> 02:48:33.404]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:48:33.684 --> 02:48:38.828]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[02:48:39.248 --> 02:48:43.111]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:48:43.491 --> 02:48:46.613]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[02:48:46.913 --> 02:48:58.020]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[02:48:58.060 --> 02:49:00.722]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[02:49:00.962 --> 02:49:06.926]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[02:49:10.447 --> 02:49:14.252]  And let's dispel once and for all this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing.
[02:49:14.292 --> 02:49:16.314]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[02:49:16.515 --> 02:49:23.844]  We have to make America rich again, and make America great again.
[02:50:02.088 --> 02:50:04.630]  I'm not gonna sit here and take it anymore!
[02:50:06.972 --> 02:50:14.257]  In today's world, abortion supporters routinely attend pro-life rallies and attempt to bully activists.
[02:50:14.937 --> 02:50:22.943]  If you have a problem and need a smelly group of commie devil worshippers, maybe you can call the A-Team.
[02:50:25.225 --> 02:50:26.926]  How many did I adopt?
[02:50:27.126 --> 02:50:27.966]  I kill my kids.
[02:50:28.447 --> 02:50:29.708]  I kill my kids.
[02:50:34.290 --> 02:50:39.772]  Hey, we saw your Facebook with your communist hammer and sickle.
[02:50:40.552 --> 02:50:41.432]  That's pretty cool, man.
[02:50:42.553 --> 02:50:43.773]  Is that you on the Facebook?
[02:50:46.334 --> 02:50:48.435]  Is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle?
[02:50:49.363 --> 02:50:50.184]  I don't think so.
[02:50:50.684 --> 02:50:52.205]  How do you get your abortions paid for?
[02:50:52.225 --> 02:50:53.126]  I pay for them.
[02:50:53.226 --> 02:50:54.627]  Yeah, how many do you pay for them?
[02:50:54.727 --> 02:50:55.207]  Upwards of 50.
[02:50:55.287 --> 02:50:55.647]  Really?
[02:50:55.767 --> 02:50:56.108]  Oh yeah.
[02:51:11.129 --> 02:51:12.309]  You, you piece of s**t!
[02:51:12.749 --> 02:51:14.550]  Bunch of misogynist mother f**kers!
[02:51:14.570 --> 02:51:16.570]  Take your male privilege somewhere else!
[02:51:16.590 --> 02:51:18.491]  Tyler, you're being aggressive.
[02:51:18.651 --> 02:51:20.891]  I'm being aggressive?
[02:51:21.111 --> 02:51:22.332]  Pardon us!
[02:51:22.432 --> 02:51:23.552]  Excuse us!
[02:51:23.672 --> 02:51:29.493]  These, that's the guys that attacked Alex Jones.
[02:51:35.335 --> 02:51:40.376]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:51:45.179 --> 02:51:49.365]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News live coverage of the GOP debate.
[02:51:49.525 --> 02:51:50.526]  We've got closing statements.
[02:51:50.546 --> 02:51:52.689]  Let's go right to the last closing statement here.
[02:51:52.709 --> 02:51:53.991]  What's happening to our country?
[02:51:54.772 --> 02:52:02.042]  All of the things that I've been talking about, whether it's trade, whether it's building up our depleted military, whether it's taking care of our vets,
[02:52:02.763 --> 02:52:10.955]  We're definitely not taking care of our vests, but by no means is our military depleted.
[02:52:10.995 --> 02:52:18.045]  I don't know where these people keep getting this from, because I've been to a lot of these bases, and we've got a lot of tanks and jets.
[02:52:20.247 --> 02:52:28.092]  I mean, I could go on auction right now and go buy a military-grade Humvee, an up-armor Humvee if I want to, in Waco.
[02:52:28.272 --> 02:52:31.955]  We got so much stuff, we're accidentally dropping it, air-dropping it.
[02:52:31.975 --> 02:52:42.001]  Well, that's the end for the debate, and of course, as we were saying during the break, I imagine that Donald Trump would be coming back and say, clowns to the left of me, chokers to the right.
[02:52:43.802 --> 02:52:46.124]  Let's see, Derek McBrain, do you have any final comments?
[02:52:47.119 --> 02:52:48.403]  Actually this is Kid Daniels now.
[02:52:48.523 --> 02:52:54.719]  Yes, The Hill came out and said that Trump dominates the Twitter chatter during GOP debate.
[02:52:55.635 --> 02:53:07.522]  And it says that Twitter revealed that 51% of conversations on the social media platform, Marco Rubio ranked second with 28%, followed by Cruz at 14%.
[02:53:07.582 --> 02:53:10.224]  Sounds like a regular debate, huh?
[02:53:10.464 --> 02:53:10.664]  Yeah.
[02:53:11.084 --> 02:53:21.651]  And I also found it very revealing how CNN, you know, they're moderating this debate, but on their Twitter account all evening has been pretty much anti-Trump.
[02:53:22.231 --> 02:53:23.072]  You know, you got the
[02:53:24.735 --> 02:53:30.760]  For example... Well, of course, every question was, uh, candidate A, would you critique Trump on this issue?
[02:53:30.780 --> 02:53:31.841]  Candidate B, would you critique him on this issue?
[02:53:31.861 --> 02:53:33.262]  Do you believe Trump's view on the border?
[02:53:33.302 --> 02:53:35.945]  Do you believe Trump's outlook on defeating ISIS?
[02:53:35.965 --> 02:53:39.508]  Do you believe Trump's, you know, it's ridiculous.
[02:53:39.548 --> 02:53:47.735]  You know, like, they, you know, they're establishment media and everything, and they also have a vested interest in trying to keep this contest going as long as they can.
[02:53:49.015 --> 02:53:51.917]  They want to not have it over with on Tuesday.
[02:53:51.957 --> 02:53:56.278]  And quite frankly, if he packs it away in most of these states, it will be effectively over for them.
[02:53:56.579 --> 02:54:03.141]  Yeah, I even CNN's lead article right now on Google News is about Marco Rubio takes a swing at Trump.
[02:54:03.562 --> 02:54:06.043]  It's all about Marco Rubio this, Marco Rubio that.
[02:54:06.483 --> 02:54:11.185]  And I mean, on Twitter you had like, Ted Cruz, real Donald Trump, true or false?
[02:54:11.705 --> 02:54:13.666]  You said the government should pay for everyone's health care.
[02:54:14.346 --> 02:54:17.427]  And you had Marco Rubio to Trump, you know, this and that.
[02:54:17.447 --> 02:54:18.727]  I'm not even going to go into all of it.
[02:54:19.267 --> 02:54:28.329]  But yeah, it's this whole narrative that CNN is trying to build is that Trump is falling and Ted Cruz and especially Marco Rubio are climbing up in the polls, and that's not the case at all.
[02:54:28.849 --> 02:54:37.251]  I mean, it's really even a pathetic attempt that they have Telemundo trying to decide the election for us, decide who the Republican nominee is.
[02:54:37.491 --> 02:54:39.191]  I mean, it's completely ridiculous.
[02:54:39.651 --> 02:54:43.133]  Yeah, that was the thing that bothered me, I think, the most about this debate.
[02:54:43.173 --> 02:54:44.955]  I said that in the last segment that we had.
[02:54:45.035 --> 02:54:46.496]  The Telemundo reporter
[02:54:47.518 --> 02:54:52.904]  Asking them questions, and every single question was about a narrow interest of Hispanic voters.
[02:54:52.924 --> 02:54:53.685]  And it's like, you know what?
[02:54:54.125 --> 02:54:57.209]  This is an election for the American president.
[02:54:57.669 --> 02:55:00.552]  I'm sorry, Telemundo, if you don't like it, but we've got broad issues.
[02:55:00.592 --> 02:55:02.014]  There's 300 million people in this country.
[02:55:02.074 --> 02:55:02.695]  Exactly.
[02:55:02.955 --> 02:55:09.442]  And we need to be looking at questions that affect everybody, not a little narrow demographic slant.
[02:55:09.982 --> 02:55:11.623]  We need to talk about Israel.
[02:55:11.943 --> 02:55:13.464]  We need to talk about the homosexuals.
[02:55:13.484 --> 02:55:15.805]  We need to talk about the Hispanics.
[02:55:16.265 --> 02:55:18.386]  How about we talk about America?
[02:55:18.826 --> 02:55:22.388]  How about we talk about what we need to do for our country, everybody?
[02:55:22.788 --> 02:55:24.629]  It isn't going to happen with the mainstream media.
[02:55:24.729 --> 02:55:26.610]  Who cares sexually how you're oriented?
[02:55:26.790 --> 02:55:27.931]  Who cares what color you are?
[02:55:28.171 --> 02:55:29.752]  Who cares if you're Jewish or not?
[02:55:30.032 --> 02:55:30.932]  Who cares?
[02:55:31.072 --> 02:55:35.354]  Our country is falling apart because we have a president that sucks.
[02:55:36.075 --> 02:55:38.176]  He's horrible and he's a Muslim.
[02:55:38.676 --> 02:55:46.585]  Yeah, and to put it bluntly, I mean, honestly, the people who listen to Telemundo, they're not going to vote in the Republican convention anyway.
[02:55:46.625 --> 02:55:48.907]  You know, they're typically going to go Democrat.
[02:55:48.967 --> 02:55:55.554]  I mean, yeah, Trump does have a... Yeah, well, yeah, but I bet a lot of them are not Telemundo listeners.
[02:55:55.575 --> 02:55:59.939]  Because the Democratic Party plays the balkanization game.
[02:56:00.039 --> 02:56:00.520]  Exactly.
[02:56:00.720 --> 02:56:09.648]  So as long as somebody is thinking of themselves as primarily not American, but as a member of some balkanized group, then yeah, that's the party for them, the Democrat Party.
[02:56:10.008 --> 02:56:22.939]  But there are a lot of people who are, whether they're working class people, or I think a lot of black people, a lot of Democrats, like we call them Reagan Democrats, people who are concerned about
[02:56:23.519 --> 02:56:24.120]  The economy.
[02:56:24.400 --> 02:56:26.041]  People are concerned they're not going to have a job.
[02:56:26.301 --> 02:56:43.175]  When they start looking at the broader issues that affect everybody, regardless of what demographic you're in, the broader issues that affect everybody, those people are going to be looking at what's going to be done to help this country instead of allowing our economy to be managed by foreign powers, which is what we have right now.
[02:56:43.235 --> 02:56:50.842]  Well, when you see all the people that were in that video getting laid off by the air conditioning manufacturer, I mean, that was all sorts of
[02:56:51.522 --> 02:56:53.083]  People there, all sorts of racism.
[02:56:53.103 --> 02:56:53.483]  That's right.
[02:56:53.983 --> 02:56:56.865]  And they were all very upset about the fact that they were going to be out of a job.
[02:56:56.885 --> 02:57:05.769]  Well, if you voted for Obama twice, and you're going to go back over the Democrat side and you're going to vote for Hillary Clinton, I mean, you're just asking for it.
[02:57:05.789 --> 02:57:07.250]  I mean, I don't feel bad for you at all.
[02:57:07.851 --> 02:57:13.513]  I mean, I don't understand how anybody could even fathom voting for Hillary Clinton.
[02:57:13.714 --> 02:57:17.516]  Hillary Clinton is going to be another four years of Obama.
[02:57:18.436 --> 02:57:32.674]  She's... And we need to focus on these issues in these Republican debates so we get someone who's going to be good because they're going to have to go up against that witch, that monster, that evil person, and we have to defeat her because if we don't, we are screwed!
[02:57:32.694 --> 02:57:34.637]  Right, and everyone's like, well why don't you guys...
[02:57:35.317 --> 02:57:38.219]  Go for Bernie as well if you're not into the left-right paradigm.
[02:57:38.519 --> 02:57:43.062]  We say all the time, I like some of the things that Bernie says, but it's not going to work.
[02:57:43.162 --> 02:57:44.263]  We can't afford it.
[02:57:44.523 --> 02:57:49.967]  We're trillion dollars and trillions of dollars in debt, and he wants to add trillions more to the debt.
[02:57:50.247 --> 02:57:50.667]  Bernie Sanders.
[02:57:50.687 --> 02:57:52.008]  There's no plan of how he's going to pay for it.
[02:57:52.048 --> 02:57:52.868]  Bernie Sanders doesn't understand math.
[02:57:52.888 --> 02:57:53.349]  It won't work.
[02:57:53.989 --> 02:57:56.851]  He wants to give free health care, free college tuition to everybody.
[02:57:57.211 --> 02:58:01.514]  He thinks that the greatest problem that we face in the world is climate change.
[02:58:01.934 --> 02:58:09.538]  So he would bankrupt the country and he would basically allow a foreign entity, a globalist entity, to tax us directly.
[02:58:10.059 --> 02:58:12.900]  And of course, he doesn't have a problem with a 90% tax rate.
[02:58:13.601 --> 02:58:15.702]  So, you know, that's basically a non sequitur.
[02:58:15.922 --> 02:58:27.239]  And then there's anyone out there who's gonna, you know, make $7 an hour because they went and got a liberal arts degree and now they're mad at everybody else because they can't afford to pay off their college education.
[02:58:27.619 --> 02:58:29.702]  That was your decision, to get a useless degree.
[02:58:29.722 --> 02:58:30.463]  That's right.
[02:58:31.044 --> 02:58:33.386]  Well, we'll see how this is going to turn out, of course.
[02:58:33.567 --> 02:58:39.553]  It's going to be five days, and they're going to have a lot of time now to slice and dice the soundbites from this debate.
[02:58:39.573 --> 02:58:42.816]  Yeah, and I got one good soundbite for you guys before we wind down.
[02:58:43.076 --> 02:58:49.643]  This is Trump, you know, the debate has just ended, and he's talking to CNN about the comments of Marco Rubio, so here we go.
[02:58:51.425 --> 02:58:56.207]  It seemed like Senator Rubio was more intent to going at you directly tonight than even Senator Cruz.
[02:58:56.247 --> 02:58:56.987]  Why do you think that was?
[02:58:57.007 --> 02:58:57.548]  I think that's true.
[02:58:57.628 --> 02:58:59.608]  I was a little surprised by it, but I liked it.
[02:58:59.628 --> 02:59:00.489]  I thought it was fine.
[02:59:00.909 --> 02:59:03.170]  Did he show you a toughness that you didn't see against Christie?
[02:59:03.250 --> 02:59:04.991]  No, I think it was the same basic person.
[02:59:05.111 --> 02:59:06.712]  But he's a meltdown guy.
[02:59:06.732 --> 02:59:09.373]  I mean, I'm looking at him, he's pouring sweat.
[02:59:09.393 --> 02:59:12.194]  I don't know what the problem is, but he's just pouring down sweat.
[02:59:12.975 --> 02:59:14.577]  So he's overheating?
[02:59:14.617 --> 02:59:15.538]  He's overheating?
[02:59:15.598 --> 02:59:18.461]  The robot's overheating.
[02:59:18.541 --> 02:59:21.784]  He needs a cooling coil going on there.
[02:59:21.824 --> 02:59:23.646]  There's a hydraulic fuel leak?
[02:59:23.927 --> 02:59:26.870]  It goes on, but it was an interesting debate.
[02:59:26.930 --> 02:59:32.436]  It was a lot more interesting than some of the previous ones, and I think we got to see a lot of people's true colors.
[02:59:33.056 --> 02:59:33.537]  We're good to go.
[02:59:51.740 --> 02:59:55.543]  Carson said, somebody please attack me so I get a chance to talk.
[02:59:56.364 --> 02:59:58.826]  When he does speak, he does have a good presentation.
[02:59:58.846 --> 03:00:01.608]  He doesn't have a desire to get in there and fight with people, which is admirable.
[03:00:01.909 --> 03:00:03.970]  He has his guns and he's sticking to it.
[03:00:04.291 --> 03:00:12.618]  The thing I thought was interesting about Carson was when they got to him and they asked him a question about Obamacare, that's something that he had thought a lot about.
[03:00:12.918 --> 03:00:18.665]  He had a very good, very free market, I think, approach to it in the sense of health care accounts.
[03:00:18.705 --> 03:00:20.167]  That's something that has been proposed.
[03:00:20.187 --> 03:00:23.772]  He's not the first person to talk about it, but that is, I think, the right approach.
[03:00:24.092 --> 03:00:25.193]  It's a free market approach.
[03:00:25.213 --> 03:00:31.581]  It's an approach that respects our informed consent and our choice, gives us accounts that we can
[03:00:32.402 --> 03:00:32.722]  Absolutely.
[03:00:49.471 --> 03:00:51.853]  You know, that's something he knew a great deal about, and he was right on it.
[03:00:52.153 --> 03:01:00.440]  But when it comes to most of these other things, and we've seen this not only from him, but from some other candidates, well, I would get a lot of, I would get advisors together.
[03:01:00.560 --> 03:01:03.022]  Yeah, I'd talk to my advisors about that.
[03:01:03.242 --> 03:01:06.024]  He said that a lot, but I mean, at least the guy's being honest about it.
[03:01:06.064 --> 03:01:07.445]  He's not blowing smoke up your butt.
[03:01:08.266 --> 03:01:09.847]  I guess, who's that, Marco Roboto?
[03:01:10.127 --> 03:01:10.348]  Yeah.
[03:01:10.528 --> 03:01:12.229]  This American presidential race...
[03:01:13.830 --> 03:01:18.352]  This American presidential race has become a reality TV show.
[03:01:18.693 --> 03:01:21.914]  And it's not a reality TV show that we're just seeing in America.
[03:01:22.254 --> 03:01:25.776]  It's a reality TV show that is failing in front of the entire world.
[03:01:26.356 --> 03:01:31.999]  Everything that's happening right now in politics with this race for the presidency is a reality TV show.
[03:01:32.299 --> 03:01:33.240]  A crappy one at that.
[03:01:33.260 --> 03:01:34.400]  It's like the Kardashians.
[03:01:34.721 --> 03:01:36.061]  And it's not just us here.
[03:01:36.322 --> 03:01:37.562]  You've got China watching that.
[03:01:37.722 --> 03:01:40.444]  You've got people all over the world watching us break down.
[03:01:40.664 --> 03:01:44.026]  We don't even have candidates that can sit here and actually talk about the issues.
[03:01:44.286 --> 03:01:49.770]  No, no, what they would rather do is bicker back and forth about who did this, who lied about that, who did that.
[03:01:50.030 --> 03:01:53.792]  Not even answering a single question about anything.
[03:01:54.032 --> 03:01:54.953]  It is stupid!
[03:01:55.373 --> 03:01:55.773]  Yeah.
[03:01:55.793 --> 03:02:01.478]  We can't even sit down and have an actual professional debate because this is a serious issue.
[03:02:01.678 --> 03:02:07.703]  This is the next four years of our life that could mean whether or not we're going to collapse or be successful.
[03:02:07.923 --> 03:02:14.328]  In the entire world, our enemies are watching us act like a bunch of crappy reality TV stars.
[03:02:14.669 --> 03:02:15.309]  It's horrible.
[03:02:15.529 --> 03:02:16.290]  Hey, look at this, Joe.
[03:02:16.310 --> 03:02:17.331]  I just can't stand it.
[03:02:17.351 --> 03:02:23.736]  Just ask him if he's heard anything about former Mexican President Vincente Fox and Trump says, I think you should apologize for his foul mouth.
[03:02:26.193 --> 03:02:27.574]  He's a character.
[03:02:27.594 --> 03:02:34.762]  He's a businessman as well as an actor, reality TV star, so he knows how to handle himself relatively well.
[03:02:35.843 --> 03:02:37.805]  Well, it's going to be interesting.
[03:02:37.905 --> 03:02:42.530]  I don't think our enemies are too worried about us right now as they watch these debates.
[03:02:43.570 --> 03:02:44.750]  Yeah, I agree with Biggs on that.
[03:02:44.790 --> 03:02:47.751]  Looks like we're selecting a president for idiocracy.
[03:02:47.791 --> 03:02:54.953]  But, you know, along those lines, I think the only thing we could do to improve that robot gif that we just saw there was we need to... It was a goo.
[03:02:54.973 --> 03:02:56.553]  It was a goo.
[03:02:56.613 --> 03:03:00.874]  Well, they have that robot clip that we've all seen with Marco Rubio's face on it.
[03:03:01.214 --> 03:03:05.735]  The guy who's knocking the box out of his hand and pushing it around, you ought to put Donald Trump's head on that.
[03:03:06.135 --> 03:03:07.837]  That wouldn't make it a problem.
[03:03:07.958 --> 03:03:21.356]  The article that he'll put out, I think they interviewed Cohen, one of the Cohen brothers, who helped write Idiocracy, and he said, I never thought my movie would end up being an actual documentary about what is happening in America today.
[03:03:21.896 --> 03:03:25.739]  They've got stupid people sitting around, have no clue about what's going on.
[03:03:25.960 --> 03:03:33.766]  They just turn on TV, they sit there, they want their free handouts, they want to order their pizza delivery, and they just want to sit there in their tiny little places.
[03:03:34.086 --> 03:03:40.551]  Meanwhile, the government's going, hell yeah, this is easy, we're going to take up all the land, we're going to move you into cities and keep you in these tight, closed quarters.
[03:03:40.852 --> 03:03:47.457]  No one actually sees what's really going on, and that's all part of the plan, to dumb you down, move you into a tiny city, take all the land away.
[03:03:47.677 --> 03:03:50.659]  So they can control it, give it to other countries so they can take the minerals.
[03:03:51.059 --> 03:03:54.140]  It's completely and totally just out of control.
[03:03:54.161 --> 03:04:00.324]  Turn it all into the federal lands for the people and then we'll sell off all the mineral rights to the Russians.
[03:04:00.404 --> 03:04:03.125]  Austin was 900,000 people like a couple years ago.
[03:04:03.345 --> 03:04:04.526]  We're over 2 million.
[03:04:05.066 --> 03:04:05.266]  Right.
[03:04:05.947 --> 03:04:10.069]  And this all ties into Vicente Fox.
[03:04:10.749 --> 03:04:13.351]  Of course he's not going to want to build a wall because I think it was like in 2006-2007 he came out
[03:04:15.872 --> 03:04:20.013]  And proposed to push his support for the North American Union.
[03:04:20.473 --> 03:04:29.236]  You know, I think he even went to the White House and told the Bush administration, we really need to start talking about this, you know, one currency between U.S., Canada, and Mexico, just like the Euro.
[03:04:30.036 --> 03:04:35.877]  And I think the White House were like, oh yeah, we're open to the idea, but we're not going to discuss this publicly.
[03:04:35.917 --> 03:04:42.159]  And I think it was even in Mexico, I think it was like in 2005, they had a North American Union summit where they discussed this.
[03:04:42.739 --> 03:04:47.722]  We had Ted Cruz's wife as part of a... Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:04:48.022 --> 03:04:51.964]  She wrote the white paper on the North American Union, I think it was like in 2007 or 2008.
[03:04:52.404 --> 03:05:01.529]  And what they wanted, their proposal was to put a border around the three countries of Canada, America and Mexico and have the border patrol by Homeland Security.
[03:05:01.809 --> 03:05:07.152]  So when Vincente Fox looks at this and they're talking about putting a wall up, he's like, what are you talking about?
[03:05:07.192 --> 03:05:09.393]  You're talking about like putting a wall up between Texas and
[03:05:09.833 --> 03:05:11.195]  Uh, Oklahoma or something?
[03:05:11.255 --> 03:05:13.057]  I mean, to them, that's the way they see it.
[03:05:13.317 --> 03:05:21.766]  And of course, I think that's part of our North American Union candidate, Ted Cruz, who thinks that because he's a Canadian, that makes him a natural-born U.S.
[03:05:21.806 --> 03:05:24.609]  citizen, natural-born North American Union citizen.
[03:05:24.689 --> 03:05:24.889]  Right.
[03:05:25.509 --> 03:05:26.730]  I think we should have a new currency.
[03:05:26.770 --> 03:05:30.531]  I think because people are so addicted to money, we should have a new currency.
[03:05:30.571 --> 03:05:33.592]  We should put the Constitution on every single bill.
[03:05:33.852 --> 03:05:35.012]  Because people love money.
[03:05:35.052 --> 03:05:35.833]  They'll look at money.
[03:05:36.013 --> 03:05:37.053]  They'll stare at it up and down.
[03:05:37.073 --> 03:05:38.633]  You'll see all these celebrities taking pictures.
[03:05:38.894 --> 03:05:43.495]  Maybe Kanye West will read the Constitution for once if we put it on one of those stacks of $20 bills.
[03:05:43.875 --> 03:05:44.615]  You know, come on, dude.
[03:05:44.775 --> 03:05:46.256]  Dissected the secret meaning.
[03:05:47.073 --> 03:05:47.793]  That's what we'll do.
[03:05:48.173 --> 03:05:51.295]  I think we're going to wrap our coverage at this point.
[03:05:51.335 --> 03:05:53.695]  Again, we're going to see how everybody spends it.
[03:05:53.775 --> 03:06:01.278]  CNN worked very hard to do everything that they could to create a world wrestling format here.
[03:06:01.638 --> 03:06:03.299]  Trying to mix it up and push everything.
[03:06:03.439 --> 03:06:04.079]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:06:04.099 --> 03:06:05.460]  David, I got something quickly.
[03:06:05.980 --> 03:06:10.682]  Drudge Report, the poll, which has been really accurate, you know, so far in these last couple debates.
[03:06:10.802 --> 03:06:11.002]  Right.
[03:06:11.582 --> 03:06:13.863]  Who won the 10th Republican debate in 2016?
[03:06:13.943 --> 03:06:14.903]  Donald Trump, about 64%.
[03:06:16.724 --> 03:06:19.485]  Going up even higher than it has in the past ones, yeah.
[03:06:19.505 --> 03:06:22.586]  And Ted Cruz was at a distant second, about 18%.
[03:06:23.306 --> 03:06:23.546]  Wow.
[03:06:23.886 --> 03:06:27.687]  So I think that's really going to speak, speaks very well for Donald Trump.
[03:06:27.707 --> 03:06:30.808]  And guess who didn't make it in that poll?
[03:06:30.828 --> 03:06:31.028]  Oh yeah.
[03:06:31.148 --> 03:06:31.608]  Right here.
[03:06:32.749 --> 03:06:33.409]  Little Jebby?
[03:06:33.429 --> 03:06:34.389]  There he is.
[03:06:34.449 --> 03:06:36.290]  Little Jebby.
[03:06:36.310 --> 03:06:39.231]  I like that one reference you guys had, the one child left behind.
[03:06:39.251 --> 03:06:41.631]  We got to eke out the one-child-left-behind Jeb joke.
[03:06:44.827 --> 03:06:47.649]  Yeah, you know, it's... He earned that name.
[03:06:47.969 --> 03:06:51.111]  He earned that placement too, that ranking.
[03:06:51.191 --> 03:07:00.638]  The Drudge Report, when we see that, we've seen Trump's numbers go up exponentially now over the last several ones of these debates.
[03:07:01.198 --> 03:07:05.462]  I think people have made up their mind for the most part, and they're consolidating along those lines.
[03:07:05.482 --> 03:07:08.405]  They see Trump as having won it, or being the most electable.
[03:07:09.125 --> 03:07:16.252]  And I think the kind of desperate attacks that CNN orchestrated tonight, I think that that just looked like what it was.
[03:07:16.712 --> 03:07:18.934]  Outright desperation and character assassination.
[03:07:18.994 --> 03:07:21.056]  And I don't think it's going to be effective for them.
[03:07:21.176 --> 03:07:24.319]  Yeah, the Drudge headline says, winless Rubio pecks at Trump.
[03:07:27.014 --> 03:07:29.536]  I think that crystallizes it very well.
[03:07:29.816 --> 03:07:30.577]  Yeah, that sums it up.
[03:07:31.297 --> 03:07:34.920]  Well, that's it for our coverage tonight, and again, this is free coverage.

[03:07:56.434 --> 03:07:58.215]  I just want to say one more thing, David.
[03:07:58.235 --> 03:08:00.216]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:08:00.236 --> 03:08:02.217]  We're going to run a couple ads here at the end.
[03:08:02.257 --> 03:08:03.178]  That helps us pay our bills.
[03:08:03.298 --> 03:08:05.559]  Anthroflex is a great product.
[03:08:05.639 --> 03:08:07.660]  Brain Force, I've used many times.
[03:08:07.700 --> 03:08:08.440]  Hillary for Prison.
[03:08:08.520 --> 03:08:11.562]  Try out some of the new products, some of the new nutraceuticals.
[03:08:11.782 --> 03:08:13.163]  Get a Hillary for Prison shirt.

[03:08:15.404 --> 03:08:16.545]  Spreading the word.
[03:08:17.365 --> 03:08:27.952]  Is also a good way to support what we're doing because the more people that watch the more people will support the more we can do in the end because we can't send reporters everywhere.
[03:08:28.272 --> 03:08:36.498]  We can't buy all the equipment we need unless we have the support from the people out there watching and we thank you for doing it because you are what is making this all happen right now.
[03:08:36.538 --> 03:08:38.059]  You're part of this info war.
[03:08:38.619 --> 03:08:39.960]  And we appreciate everything you're doing.
[03:08:40.280 --> 03:08:40.980]  That's right, Rob.
[03:08:41.040 --> 03:08:41.620]  And you know what?
[03:08:41.780 --> 03:08:51.443]  If it wasn't for Brain Force, I don't think many of us would be still awake at this time of night or able to operate the board back there like you're doing or to close the show.
[03:08:51.503 --> 03:08:52.564]  And so that's it for tonight.
[03:08:53.024 --> 03:08:55.045]  Join us again tomorrow night at 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:08:55.085 --> 03:08:55.405]  Eastern.
[03:08:55.425 --> 03:08:56.125]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:09:02.577 --> 03:09:09.243]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[03:09:09.503 --> 03:09:11.585]  You better believe you got one!
[03:09:29.286 --> 03:09:38.106]  In a bohemian grove that I attend, one time at a time, the elders and the others that come there, but it is the most faggot goddamn thing you'll ever imagine.
[03:09:51.121 --> 03:09:54.523]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:09:54.904 --> 03:10:02.008]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:10:02.629 --> 03:10:11.014]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:10:11.235 --> 03:10:15.397]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:10:15.677 --> 03:10:20.821]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[03:10:21.241 --> 03:10:25.083]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:10:25.483 --> 03:10:28.585]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[03:10:28.905 --> 03:10:40.010]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[03:10:40.050 --> 03:10:42.712]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[03:10:42.952 --> 03:10:48.915]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[03:10:49.475 --> 03:10:50.477]  BrainForce is here.
[03:10:51.018 --> 03:10:53.302]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:10:53.582 --> 03:11:01.436]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[03:11:02.202 --> 03:11:05.804]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[03:11:05.824 --> 03:11:08.166]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[03:11:08.546 --> 03:11:12.069]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[03:11:12.109 --> 03:11:15.251]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[03:11:15.771 --> 03:11:20.554]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[03:11:21.135 --> 03:11:22.956]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[03:11:23.316 --> 03:11:27.759]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[03:11:27.919 --> 03:11:29.941]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[03:11:30.561 --> 03:11:32.022]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[03:11:32.182 --> 03:11:32.422]  Exactly.
[03:11:32.442 --> 03:11:36.243]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[03:11:36.763 --> 03:11:44.066]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:11:44.326 --> 03:11:44.786]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[03:12:20.537 --> 03:12:22.524]  I'm gonna sit here and take it anymore!
