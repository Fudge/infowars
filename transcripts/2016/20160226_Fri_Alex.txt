[00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:09.770]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.331]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.331 --> 00:00:12.891]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.891 --> 00:00:17.093]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.093 --> 00:00:21.134]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.798 --> 00:00:26.600]  Wow, what an amazing debate last night.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.903]  We'll be playing the clips, taking your phone calls.
[00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:35.352]  Roger Stone, the consummate Trump insider, will be joining us for at least an hour and a half in studio today.
[00:00:35.352 --> 00:00:37.955]  He's driving over to the studio right now with Richard Reeves.
[00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:51.130]  We have another guest on who's an investigative journalist award-winning who talked to the Russian source about their preparedness to use tactical nuclear weapons against Turkey or Saudi Arabia if they bring in large ground forces.
[00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.933]  That's really default Russian and NATO policy if either side does that.
[00:00:54.933 --> 00:01:05.200]  So I wouldn't say that's so much breaking news, but I want to get the perspective from the Russian sources high up that that gentleman talked to, Robert Parry.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.722]  So that is coming up as well today.
[00:01:08.502 --> 00:01:10.602]  That's from ConsortiumNews.com.
[00:01:10.602 --> 00:01:14.043]  Roger Stone of StoneZone.com.
[00:01:14.043 --> 00:01:20.064]  We are going to obviously have a really jam-packed broadcast today.
[00:01:20.064 --> 00:01:24.425]  Coming up, I want to air a special report that John Bowne has put out.
[00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:26.006]  It's going up on Infowars.com.
[00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:27.206]  It's very informative.
[00:01:27.206 --> 00:01:30.466]  Europe collapsing as migrant invasion doubles.
[00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:35.227]  And that ties in with mainstream news.
[00:01:35.227 --> 00:01:37.648]  Mainstream news out of Europe.
[00:01:39.011 --> 00:01:44.294]  We are heading into anarchy, official says, EU will completely break down in 10 days.
[00:01:44.294 --> 00:01:47.955]  And this is what they're saying in France and Sweden, and this is what the governments are saying.
[00:01:47.955 --> 00:02:06.344]  They're going to use the crisis that they've engineered, just millions and millions of homeless people that are super entitled, many of them, that are robbing and raping, that just come out of complete third world cavemanville, just showing up in domesticated Europe, running around foaming at the mouth like a Day of the Dead invasion.
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.464]  By the way, desperate people from anywhere in the world, about 10 days, turn into murdering savages.
[00:02:13.464 --> 00:02:19.808]  Within about 15 to 16 days, the Pentagon studies show that 90 plus percent of people turn into cannibals.
[00:02:19.808 --> 00:02:21.409]  Others just commit suicide.
[00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:31.111]  And you see that laid out in fiction in the movie The Road with Viggo Mortensen, a film so horrifying that I can only watch it once, even though it's one of the best films I've ever seen.
[00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:33.531]  I told Viggo that, and he said, I agree.
[00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:39.292]  He said, I can't watch it anymore either, because it's that real, that scary, that well done.
[00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:46.773]  You ought to show it to your spoiled, rotten teenage kids about what'll happen during a societal collapse.
[00:02:46.773 --> 00:02:49.294]  Robert Duvall's in it too, but I'm digressing.
[00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.693]  Big Trump insider in to talk inside baseball, where all this is going.
[00:02:54.693 --> 00:02:57.695]  You hear so much of what later comes out from Trump from Stone.
[00:02:57.695 --> 00:02:59.777]  This is going to be important.
[00:02:59.777 --> 00:03:03.520]  The entire world is lining up against Trump.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.621]  It is truly sickening.
[00:03:04.621 --> 00:03:08.824]  The Chinese government, the former Mexican presidents, the Democrats, the Republicans.
[00:03:08.824 --> 00:03:11.226]  I was watching Fox News this morning while I worked out for an hour.
[00:03:13.394 --> 00:03:23.864]  And it was all subtle, but the lies were sickening that yes, it's white blue collar people that like Trump.
[00:03:23.864 --> 00:03:26.467]  It's racism.
[00:03:26.467 --> 00:03:29.650]  When have you just say we can't pay for everything for everybody free.
[00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.751]  We can't have open borders.
[00:03:30.751 --> 00:03:33.333]  We can't have unfair deals with China.
[00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:33.473]  We.
[00:03:34.813 --> 00:03:36.854]  Shouldn't have this private Federal Reserve raping us.
[00:03:36.854 --> 00:03:39.634]  Mega corporations shouldn't be tax-exempt.
[00:03:39.634 --> 00:03:41.235]  We shouldn't have war with Russia.
[00:03:41.235 --> 00:03:54.439]  They just yell, racist, racist, racist, when the Democratic Party has been instilling race-based brainwashing in quote minority communities to the point of, I have stacks of news here today,
[00:03:55.259 --> 00:04:07.644]  Where the different social justice warrior groups and Black Lives Matter and others are going into events, attacking people, assaulting people, trying to shut down university speakers, pulling guns on folks.
[00:04:07.644 --> 00:04:10.565]  I mean, they're building an army of political correctness bullies.
[00:04:14.571 --> 00:04:15.892]  And it makes my head spin.
[00:04:15.892 --> 00:04:16.252]  Look at this.
[00:04:16.252 --> 00:04:22.916]  Leftist pull firearm, block entrance to stop conservative from speaking at California State University.
[00:04:22.916 --> 00:04:25.818]  Nothing was done to him for pulling guns, you name it.
[00:04:25.818 --> 00:04:30.821]  Outrages school calls police after pupil looks at UKIP website in class.
[00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:31.362]  UK Express.
[00:04:32.435 --> 00:04:33.896]  That's like a Ron Paul party.
[00:04:33.896 --> 00:04:35.417]  Pretty milk dust.
[00:04:35.417 --> 00:04:39.620]  They just say, hey, we shouldn't be in the EU, grabbing all our liberties taken.
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:48.186]  And it's the fastest growing party, but they act like with the kids it's illegal because they've got the kids in their little brainwashing centers.
[00:04:48.186 --> 00:04:49.647]  Big broadcast lined up today.
[00:04:49.647 --> 00:04:50.168]  Stay with us.
[00:04:50.168 --> 00:04:51.229]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.271]  A bunch of clips, highlights from the debate last night and more coming up.
[00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:05.944]  It turns out Hillary Clinton and her top aides aren't the only ones with secret email aliases.
[00:05:05.944 --> 00:05:16.412]  Documents uncovered through the Freedom of Information Act reveal that former Attorney General Eric Holder used a false name for his official Justice Department email account.
[00:05:16.412 --> 00:05:24.359]  According to documents obtained by Vice News, all mentions of Lou Alcindor, the birth name of basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,
[00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:27.081]  We're actually referring to Holder himself.
[00:05:27.081 --> 00:05:38.648]  In response to the FOIA release, a Justice Department spokesman said that Holder's actions, they're not improper, legally questionable, or used to thwart FOIA requests seeking information on the former Attorney General.
[00:05:38.648 --> 00:05:40.570]  Hmm, where have we heard that before?
[00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:51.577]  Experts in FOIA law say Holder's Lou Alcindor identity calls into question the ability of FOIA staff to locate all emails from an official who uses an alias.
[00:05:51.577 --> 00:05:52.358]  Indeed.
[00:05:52.358 --> 00:05:54.479]  You can read more at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:54.681]  Yeah.
[00:06:01.834 --> 00:06:11.561]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:06:11.561 --> 00:06:14.262]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:06:14.262 --> 00:06:17.825]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:06:17.825 --> 00:06:24.149]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:28.712]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[00:06:28.712 --> 00:06:29.352]  I think so.
[00:06:58.686 --> 00:07:04.452]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:07:04.452 --> 00:07:18.887]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:27.154]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:07:27.154 --> 00:07:32.579]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:07:32.579 --> 00:07:36.282]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:07:36.282 --> 00:07:40.426]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:44.290]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:48.852]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.

[00:08:10.229 --> 00:08:13.791]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:23.878]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:31.162]  Well, it's going to be a challenge today to get to all the news because there is so much of it and it is over-the-top insane.
[00:08:31.162 --> 00:08:35.185]  Consummate Trump insider, former head of the Trump campaign.
[00:08:35.185 --> 00:08:38.087]  Roger Stone will be in studio with us for at least an hour and a half today.
[00:08:39.787 --> 00:08:43.710]  And we'll also shoot some special reports with him as well.
[00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:49.335]  And so, you want the inside baseball, you want to hear what's coming next in the attacks against Trump.
[00:08:49.335 --> 00:08:55.700]  It's like he was on with us last Friday and said get ready for Trump to come out and call for an audit of the Fed, and then it happened on Monday.
[00:08:57.154 --> 00:09:01.517]  And he just continues to basically break down where Donald Trump is coming from.
[00:09:01.517 --> 00:09:05.059]  And as you've seen, he's come out for 9-11 truth in the 28 pages.
[00:09:05.059 --> 00:09:07.200]  He's come out for sovereignty.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:13.484]  He has come out for China not being able to have internal tariffs against our goods.
[00:09:13.484 --> 00:09:16.025]  And then the media says, how dare you be a protectionist?
[00:09:16.025 --> 00:09:21.528]  No, if they have tariffs and then we don't, that's called a screw job.
[00:09:21.528 --> 00:09:25.130]  So this is just default stuff coming up today.
[00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.731]  Then there's news.
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:37.289]  Like this one, DOJ documents reveal email alias used by Eric Holder to get around the Open Records Act and commit felonies.
[00:09:37.289 --> 00:09:42.393]  And that's what the head of the EPA had to step down four years ago about.
[00:09:42.393 --> 00:09:44.615]  But not Holder, not Hillary.
[00:09:44.615 --> 00:09:46.517]  Just want to illustrate that.
[00:09:48.117 --> 00:09:52.721]  We are going to also get into the implosion of Europe.
[00:09:52.721 --> 00:09:57.445]  They've got the heads of Sweden and other countries saying we are headed into anarchy collapse.
[00:09:57.445 --> 00:09:59.707]  The EU will collapse within 10 days.
[00:09:59.707 --> 00:10:04.512]  Migration figures reveal nearly half of Britain's job growth is taken by foreign nationals.
[00:10:06.926 --> 00:10:13.011]  And how this ties into the larger plan to implode Western economies and bring us into third world status.
[00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:16.673]  So we're so poor, we can't be politically uppity.
[00:10:16.673 --> 00:10:22.237]  That is the Cloward and Piven austerity impoverishment plan.
[00:10:22.237 --> 00:10:28.122]  And that ties into Vicente Fox coming out and saying, you're not going to have an effing wall, Trump.
[00:10:28.122 --> 00:10:31.725]  I mean, Vicente Fox, what a gangster.
[00:10:31.725 --> 00:10:35.948]  And Kit Daniels put up a flashback to a story he wrote a couple of years ago
[00:10:38.663 --> 00:10:46.445]  Where Vicente Fox openly came out in speeches and called for North American Union merging Mexico and the U.S.
[00:10:46.445 --> 00:10:49.786]  Well, he signed a secret treaty with Bush and Paul Martin.
[00:10:49.786 --> 00:10:50.747]  Remember that?
[00:10:50.747 --> 00:10:53.467]  Back in 2005 at Waco.
[00:10:53.467 --> 00:10:55.868]  And the details of the treaty are still secret.
[00:10:55.868 --> 00:10:59.189]  But they leaked through a Banff, Canada meeting that was secret.
[00:10:59.189 --> 00:11:01.550]  And so Judicial Watch sued and got those documents.
[00:11:02.307 --> 00:11:06.951]  And it's the end of sovereignty, and that means the end of you having elected governments.
[00:11:06.951 --> 00:11:10.294]  And then these guys go and sit on the boards above them.
[00:11:10.294 --> 00:11:15.638]  So these politicians and lobbyists and corporate heads are bought and paid for by special interests.
[00:11:15.638 --> 00:11:27.368]  They create multinational bodies, transfer government power to those irrevocably, and then they get the positions managing it for the globalists.
[00:11:27.368 --> 00:11:28.449]  I mean, this is just insane.
[00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:34.133]  So Trump comes out and says, hey, buddy, the wall just got 10 feet taller.
[00:11:34.133 --> 00:11:37.836]  Look, Trump is feeding people red meat on this.
[00:11:37.836 --> 00:11:42.360]  We do need walls in some of the big populist areas, but they're ineffective.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.380]  People just dig under them.
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.182]  They fly over them.
[00:11:45.182 --> 00:11:52.548]  We need to just go after employers that at an industrial level hire illegals and do it illegally.
[00:11:54.042 --> 00:12:02.248]  And we need to go after the aggravated felons and criminals that are here from all over the world and not let people fly in and have anchor babies.
[00:12:02.248 --> 00:12:08.713]  China now surpassed, last December, the amount of people total from Latin America coming in with anchor babies.
[00:12:09.634 --> 00:12:13.597]  Tens of thousands a month of anchor babies, and then we've got to pay for it.
[00:12:13.597 --> 00:12:15.278]  You can't go to China and do that.
[00:12:15.278 --> 00:12:18.160]  And they spin all this and act like Donald Trump is a racist.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:24.745]  And then last night, Rubio and Cruz are like, you hired over 1,500 foreigners at your hotels in the US.
[00:12:24.745 --> 00:12:28.848]  And Trump goes, I never said I was against seasonal workers that come in legally.
[00:12:28.848 --> 00:12:31.190]  Did you hear what I said?
[00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:32.771]  In the hottest areas of the country,
[00:12:33.703 --> 00:12:44.329]  Just like cruise ships in the cruise season, you've got to bring in people that basically go all over the world working seasonally at hotels.
[00:12:44.329 --> 00:12:49.632]  Because in those hot areas like Florida, in the summer, you cannot get the help.
[00:12:49.632 --> 00:12:58.477]  And I'm totally for people that seasonally come in and work, and then if they like the country, make it easier for them to come here and be citizens.
[00:13:00.117 --> 00:13:02.678]  Look, Americans, I don't care if they're U.S.
[00:13:02.678 --> 00:13:08.280]  citizens, black, white, or Hispanic, once you get middle class, you start having two kids or less.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.720]  And so, Americans aren't having kids.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.081]  We've got to bring people in.
[00:13:12.081 --> 00:13:19.743]  But let's bring people in who want to work and who want to go to college and who don't have criminal records.
[00:13:19.743 --> 00:13:24.805]  No, the globalists, the liberals, the Democrats, they want dependency.
[00:13:24.805 --> 00:13:26.385]  Oh, you wear 6X underwear?
[00:13:26.385 --> 00:13:27.246]  Let's order 40,000 pairs of those.
[00:13:29.326 --> 00:13:32.228]  That's how many obese people they thought they were bringing in.
[00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:35.111]  Oh, you've got a broken back and you're from Guatemala?
[00:13:35.111 --> 00:13:38.113]  Get on a plane and get here and you're paid for.
[00:13:38.113 --> 00:13:45.900]  That's why Mexico allows these corridors now on the railways, as long as you don't get off of them, for people to pour in from the third world.
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.722]  They don't let you stay in Mexico, but you want to go to El Norte?
[00:13:48.722 --> 00:13:49.082]  Go ahead.
[00:13:49.082 --> 00:13:55.608]  And then Joe Biden came out and apologized to Mexico for the mean things the Republicans are saying.
[00:13:57.113 --> 00:14:00.255]  I mean, this is the most ridiculous insanity.
[00:14:00.255 --> 00:14:03.317]  But I remember, I was going, hey, here's the Obamacare bill.
[00:14:03.317 --> 00:14:10.302]  It has death panels, ration care, computers, run by bioethics boards, will cut your care.
[00:14:10.302 --> 00:14:14.846]  The insurance companies wrote it to double, triple charge you and screw you over and make you buy it.
[00:14:14.846 --> 00:14:15.846]  This is so horrible.
[00:14:15.846 --> 00:14:17.167]  It's unprecedented.
[00:14:17.167 --> 00:14:20.290]  It's mainly foreign-owned banks that own the insurance companies.
[00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.691]  It's a tax to foreign corporations.
[00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:24.793]  And the Supreme Court came out a year later and said, yeah, it's a tax.
[00:14:26.952 --> 00:14:35.700]  It's a global tribute, a global ransom paid to multinationals.
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.003]  We are such a joke.
[00:14:39.003 --> 00:14:41.085]  And Trump dumbs it down to, hey, we make bad deals.
[00:14:41.085 --> 00:14:44.108]  No, we are jokes.
[00:14:44.108 --> 00:14:48.573]  And we're being sucked dry because we're soft, we're lazy on average, and we're stupid.
[00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:50.307]  And I'm not being negative.
[00:14:50.307 --> 00:14:51.207]  I love America.
[00:14:51.207 --> 00:15:04.998]  There's still a lot of great people here, but the last generation or two sits there in all this wealth and just lays around as soft and then complains all day about the people that are working that aren't giving them enough.
[00:15:04.998 --> 00:15:11.302]  Even people that have jobs, a lot of them complain they don't have a helicopter or a fancy car or whatever.
[00:15:11.302 --> 00:15:15.886]  When the poor of this country are the best off in the world, and I am sick of hearing about it.
[00:15:16.892 --> 00:15:26.638]  The homeless people, folks, that you meet out there, most of them don't want to go get one of the work job programs or the apartments provided by local systems and churches.
[00:15:26.638 --> 00:15:27.719]  They don't want help.
[00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:31.281]  I've gone out and tried to do documentaries three times with Anthony.
[00:15:32.278 --> 00:15:45.590]  Where we go out and try to get somebody that doesn't look completely insane as a homeless person, take them to get clothes, get them a job, and they'll sit there and try, when we're buying them clothes at Dillard's, to run back in and turn them back in for money.
[00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:49.994]  Even though we're giving them money, giving them clothes, trying to get them an apartment, they don't want it.
[00:15:49.994 --> 00:15:51.496]  They just want to run scams.
[00:15:51.496 --> 00:15:54.458]  It's how their brains work.
[00:15:54.458 --> 00:15:56.740]  It's like feral humans just running around.
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.102]  They want to sit there on the street.
[00:15:59.502 --> 00:16:08.426]  I was downtown yesterday, and at three different lights, there were people with their squeegee things going, you better let me clean your car, you better try to intimidate me, and I just ignored them.
[00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:12.428]  They were going over to women and stuff, and they were giving them ten dollars, and they would grab it away from them.
[00:16:12.428 --> 00:16:25.394]  It's just, this country, when it goes belly up in the Depression, is going to explode like a fireball of spoiled, rotten, zombie scum running around burning everything.
[00:16:25.394 --> 00:16:28.315]  Thank God we've got a Second Amendment, we'll at least be able to protect ourselves.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:45.907]  And then we're lectured by Vicente Fox, who kept his people as slaves and sold Mexico out to the multinationals like his predecessors, lecturing us that we have to do whatever he says.
[00:16:45.907 --> 00:16:47.047]  We're all cowed.
[00:16:47.047 --> 00:16:47.568]  Yes, sir.
[00:16:47.568 --> 00:16:49.028]  We'll use whatever words you say.
[00:16:49.028 --> 00:16:49.649]  Yes, sir.
[00:16:49.649 --> 00:16:52.770]  But here's what's big that came out of the debate.
[00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:59.393]  Donald Trump really is a magnificent golden toad.
[00:17:01.404 --> 00:17:03.540]  He's just up there.
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:04.084]  Confident.
[00:17:05.799 --> 00:17:10.021]  And not telling anyone that he's being audited.
[00:17:10.021 --> 00:17:11.741]  And he goes, maybe I'm being persecuted.
[00:17:11.741 --> 00:17:13.522]  You know, like all the Christians and everybody.
[00:17:13.522 --> 00:17:14.963]  He doesn't come out and say, oh, I'm being persecuted.
[00:17:14.963 --> 00:17:15.563]  Oh, they're attacking me.
[00:17:15.563 --> 00:17:17.364]  He's like, yeah, they're persecuting me.
[00:17:17.364 --> 00:17:19.405]  Yeah, they've been auditing me over and over again.
[00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:21.005]  And Carson goes, I got audited too.
[00:17:21.005 --> 00:17:23.386]  Never before until I gave the prayer breakfast.
[00:17:23.386 --> 00:17:24.647]  That's what they do.
[00:17:24.647 --> 00:17:27.188]  And then everybody goes, oh, you better not be politically involved.
[00:17:27.188 --> 00:17:32.830]  You'll get audited by this criminal organization set up in 1913 with the Federal Reserve.
[00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.151]  None of it goes to run the country.
[00:17:35.578 --> 00:17:54.985]  It all goes inwards on the debt, we've been maneuvered into bankruptcy, and then here we are, scared of this group that persecuted tens of thousands of organizations and groups and churches, while the Pope runs around saying, open your borders, and all the liberal churches say, GD, America, get rid of Christ, mother and father is bad.
[00:17:54.985 --> 00:18:00.227]  This is a revolution of criminal trash.
[00:18:00.227 --> 00:18:00.407]  In.
[00:18:00.407 --> 00:18:02.108]  Our.
[00:18:02.108 --> 00:18:02.388]  Face.
[00:18:05.313 --> 00:18:07.054]  What a joke!
[00:18:07.054 --> 00:18:11.217]  What a ridiculous, absolute, over-the-top joke.
[00:18:11.217 --> 00:18:28.871]  And then you've got Vicente Fox, who looks like the archetypal medieval devil, telling us that we have to do whatever he says, along with the communist murdering Chinese, and along with the bizarro Pope and his league of pedophile priests, you know, that the left has installed to destroy the Catholic Church.
[00:18:28.871 --> 00:18:30.312]  Their takeover's now complete.
[00:18:30.312 --> 00:18:31.893]  And then we're lectured by this guy.
[00:18:31.893 --> 00:18:34.455]  So let's go to a clip of Donald Trump
[00:18:36.109 --> 00:18:39.670]  Saying on why he hasn't released his taxes that they're making a big deal out of.
[00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:46.532]  They came at you tonight about something that's in the news right now that really is at your control, which is the tax returns.
[00:18:46.532 --> 00:18:48.992]  Mitt Romney during the debate was bringing it up again.
[00:18:48.992 --> 00:18:51.193]  You could show him in a second if you want to.
[00:18:51.193 --> 00:18:52.733]  Why is Trump delaying what he said?
[00:18:52.733 --> 00:18:53.653]  Let me explain about Mitt.
[00:18:53.653 --> 00:18:56.354]  You know, Mitt is a guy who was a horrible candidate.
[00:18:56.354 --> 00:18:58.915]  He lost a race that should have been won and should have been won easily.
[00:18:58.915 --> 00:18:59.655]  And I don't know what happened.
[00:18:59.655 --> 00:19:01.536]  He like disappeared the last two months.
[00:19:01.536 --> 00:19:02.776]  But when Mitt gave his
[00:19:03.796 --> 00:19:07.258]  Tax returns just so you understand it was about six months from now in 2012.
[00:19:07.258 --> 00:19:13.442]  It was 2012 It was exactly September 21st, and that's when he gave his tax return.
[00:19:13.442 --> 00:19:20.287]  We're in a different world So you know Mitt is just trying to remain relevant Nobody's talking too much anymore.
[00:19:20.287 --> 00:19:22.808]  He got some publicity today, but the one problem.
[00:19:22.808 --> 00:19:23.449]  I have is that
[00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:27.833]  I'm always audited by the IRS, which I think is very unfair.
[00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:34.018]  I don't know, maybe because of religion, maybe because of something else, maybe because I'm doing this, although this is just recently.
[00:19:34.018 --> 00:19:35.059]  What do you mean religion?
[00:19:35.059 --> 00:19:39.963]  Well, maybe because of the fact that I'm a strong Christian, and I feel strongly about it, and maybe there's a bias.
[00:19:39.963 --> 00:19:42.025]  You think maybe you get audited for being a strong Christian?
[00:19:42.025 --> 00:19:43.026]  Well, you see what's happened.
[00:19:43.026 --> 00:19:45.468]  I mean, you have many religious groups that are complaining about that.
[00:19:45.468 --> 00:19:47.489]  They've been complaining about it for a long time.
[00:19:47.489 --> 00:19:49.151]  So what are the ones that aren't audited?
[00:19:49.151 --> 00:19:50.492]  Just seems like an easy answer for you.
[00:19:50.712 --> 00:19:51.712]  No, I can't do that.
[00:19:51.712 --> 00:19:52.333]  I can't do that.
[00:19:52.333 --> 00:19:54.993]  We have to put it together in a very unified way.
[00:19:54.993 --> 00:19:56.594]  They all relate to each other.
[00:19:56.594 --> 00:19:59.335]  I don't know if you saw the picture I have where I have almost a thousand pages.
[00:19:59.335 --> 00:20:00.295]  It's a stack of paper.
[00:20:00.295 --> 00:20:04.696]  The ones from previous relate to the ones later and it doesn't make sense unless they're all related.
[00:20:04.696 --> 00:20:07.317]  You know what you would do with this issue if somebody else had it?
[00:20:07.617 --> 00:20:08.818]  You'd say, what are you talking about?
[00:20:08.818 --> 00:20:11.200]  The tax returns, just put it out, he doesn't want to put them out?
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:19.227]  Nobody, nobody that's under a regular audit, I mean it's just a regular audit I do, almost every year, I think for 12 years, 10 years, 12 years, I get audited.
[00:20:19.227 --> 00:20:22.891]  Nobody would ever put out their returns that's under an audit.
[00:20:23.939 --> 00:20:26.501]  Now, look at Cuomo.
[00:20:26.501 --> 00:20:29.422]  If you're a TV, if you're a radio listener, I'll describe his body language.
[00:20:29.422 --> 00:20:31.344]  He has saucer eyes.
[00:20:31.344 --> 00:20:35.706]  You think the IRS might persecute you for political reasons or religious?
[00:20:35.706 --> 00:20:36.967]  What?
[00:20:36.967 --> 00:20:41.650]  They just go on MSNBC and say, good, target the conservatives and Christians and libertarians and veterans.
[00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:42.471]  They're bad.
[00:20:42.471 --> 00:20:43.832]  They're racist.
[00:20:43.832 --> 00:20:44.732]  We're all bad.
[00:20:44.732 --> 00:20:48.895]  We just deserve to be persecuted illegally for political reasons.
[00:20:48.895 --> 00:20:50.516]  This is an open group of filth.
[00:20:51.869 --> 00:20:54.630]  They're exercising their bullying openly against us.
[00:20:54.630 --> 00:21:01.811]  And then Cuomo's like, you mean the IRS might persecute you, a frontrunner that the New York Times is calling for killing?
[00:21:01.811 --> 00:21:06.953]  And everyone's calling for it to be destroyed in the establishment?
[00:21:06.953 --> 00:21:11.474]  And that foreign governments are threatening us over from Mexico to China and the Pope?
[00:21:11.474 --> 00:21:15.135]  You mean the IRS might be tough?
[00:21:15.135 --> 00:21:17.295]  That is ridiculous!
[00:21:17.295 --> 00:21:19.155]  I mean, we've only seen them.
[00:21:19.155 --> 00:21:21.136]  Nixon had a hundred and something names in a safe.
[00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:31.357]  He was looking in his meetings at persecuting a few people or leaking the problems with their taxes.
[00:21:31.357 --> 00:21:37.860]  Obama has gone after more than 10,000 organizations and taken their 501c3s, 501c4s and others.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:43.362]  They've refused all but one in the last three or four years was the
[00:21:44.923 --> 00:21:54.632]  Associated Press headline, all 501c3s for conservatives, libertarians, gun groups, you name it.
[00:21:54.632 --> 00:22:00.097]  Americana, John Wayne, Ronald Reagan, George Washington, whatever you want to call it.
[00:22:00.097 --> 00:22:03.540]  I mean, milquetoast folks, milquetoast groups, they refuse them.
[00:22:04.639 --> 00:22:10.903]  To control the process, but they've not refused one leftist and given out more than 10,000 of them.
[00:22:10.903 --> 00:22:28.756]  Massive persecution, audits, indictments, harassment, like the world has never seen worse than the Soviet Union using the tax man to go after people and doing this and then Cuomo, oh my gosh, you said the IRS might be doing something and
[00:22:29.136 --> 00:22:37.682]  Trump goes, because, see, I would say, just as they've been persecuting Christians and conservatives and veterans groups and others, I believe they're persecuting me.
[00:22:37.682 --> 00:22:38.883]  He lets them walk into it.
[00:22:38.883 --> 00:22:40.004]  He's slicker than I am.
[00:22:40.004 --> 00:22:41.585]  I put everything right up front.
[00:22:41.585 --> 00:22:44.527]  Trump goes, I think they might be persecuting me.
[00:22:44.527 --> 00:22:52.853]  Acting weak, so Cuomo, because everybody knows they're persecuting everybody, you know, who isn't anti-American, who isn't a criminal, scum filth, literally.
[00:22:52.853 --> 00:22:54.494]  It's an army of filth.
[00:22:54.494 --> 00:22:56.396]  Lying, con artists, scum.
[00:22:56.396 --> 00:22:57.777]  I mean, these people are the worst
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.381]  Crash the planet's ever seen.
[00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:10.065]  They've gotten fat and arrogant off America's prowess, off of our wealth, off of our innovation, off of our rugged individualism.
[00:23:10.065 --> 00:23:17.288]  They've all but extincted, though, what gave them all their power because they're still threatened by it because they're thieves.
[00:23:17.288 --> 00:23:20.650]  It's like scum that'll kidnap some beautiful model and rape her.
[00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:29.194]  Then they kill her because they hate how good looking she is in criminology and they want the power over her because they're ugly, degenerate filth in their hearts.
[00:23:31.539 --> 00:23:33.120]  And yes, we should hate these people.
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:33.921]  They hate us.
[00:23:33.921 --> 00:23:35.862]  They're at war against us.
[00:23:35.862 --> 00:23:38.604]  They are dumb trash.
[00:23:38.604 --> 00:23:40.325]  But they know how to intimidate.
[00:23:40.325 --> 00:23:47.869]  They know how to get in our face because they know good people, chivalrous people, honorable people are nice and loving and good and want to help everybody.
[00:23:47.869 --> 00:23:53.573]  So they intimidate and they henpeck and they guilt trip with their social justice warrior garbage.
[00:23:53.573 --> 00:23:54.514]  And it's everywhere.
[00:23:55.279 --> 00:23:59.940]  It's everywhere, in jobs and businesses and in relationships and in life.
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.881]  They don't produce, they don't work, they don't do anything.
[00:24:02.881 --> 00:24:08.122]  They just guilt trip everybody around them that they have the moral high ground and you don't.
[00:24:08.122 --> 00:24:10.543]  And it's time to break the spell.
[00:24:10.543 --> 00:24:13.023]  It's time to say, no!
[00:24:13.023 --> 00:24:13.944]  No!
[00:24:13.944 --> 00:24:15.624]  You are disgusting!
[00:24:16.991 --> 00:24:20.677]  Look at the Canadian government poll and study they did three years ago.
[00:24:20.677 --> 00:24:23.241]  Look at the British poll they did in the UK.
[00:24:23.241 --> 00:24:29.832]  In both studies they found fake, mainline, liberal environmentalists are six times more likely to steal
[00:24:31.443 --> 00:24:41.271]  And just as many times likely to lie and to not also, I think it was like nine times more likely, we had to pull a study up, two of them, not to give charity.
[00:24:41.271 --> 00:24:45.655]  But they tell you how they give charity on Facebook all day and on Twitter.
[00:24:45.655 --> 00:24:47.957]  They tell you how you need to be involved in charity.
[00:24:47.957 --> 00:24:56.504]  They tell you how you're bad, but they don't give anybody anything because they're greedy, lazy filth.
[00:24:56.504 --> 00:24:57.465]  And I see it everywhere.
[00:24:59.281 --> 00:25:00.401]  I see it everywhere.
[00:25:00.401 --> 00:25:02.962]  It's an economy of guilt and manipulation.
[00:25:02.962 --> 00:25:04.743]  The ADL is built on it.
[00:25:04.743 --> 00:25:07.103]  The Southern Poverty Law Center is built on it.
[00:25:07.103 --> 00:25:10.445]  They're all built on it.
[00:25:10.445 --> 00:25:12.425]  You do what we say and turn your guns into your races.
[00:25:12.425 --> 00:25:16.526]  You do what we say and let us rip you off with Obamacare or you're a racist.
[00:25:16.526 --> 00:25:21.308]  You sit there and let us open the borders up and bring in the North American Union and drive everybody's wages down.
[00:25:21.308 --> 00:25:27.270]  They let people in with TB and AIDS and HIV and tuberculosis now.
[00:25:28.086 --> 00:25:29.827]  And they put it in the Associated Press.
[00:25:29.827 --> 00:25:32.148]  Hey, we're bringing people in with diseases.
[00:25:32.148 --> 00:25:36.830]  I mean, that's what the Huns would do in China.
[00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:38.031]  And the Mongols, they would...
[00:25:39.693 --> 00:25:43.057]  Catapult bodies with the black plague over the walls.
[00:25:43.057 --> 00:25:48.003]  I mean, we are under military attack by the globalists.
[00:25:48.003 --> 00:25:49.504]  Shutting down our power plants.
[00:25:49.504 --> 00:25:51.146]  Dumbing our kids down in schools.
[00:25:51.146 --> 00:25:52.228]  Breaking up the families.
[00:25:52.228 --> 00:25:53.349]  Poisoning our water.
[00:25:53.349 --> 00:25:55.291]  Poisoning our fields with glyphosate.
[00:25:55.291 --> 00:25:57.373]  This is a military attack.
[00:25:57.373 --> 00:25:58.415]  You think the globalists thought...
[00:25:58.855 --> 00:26:01.276]  In the last 60 years they could just come invade America?
[00:26:01.276 --> 00:26:08.758]  They came in and infiltrated it, they took it over, and now we are under chemical and biological attack, and they're just slowly turning the level up.
[00:26:08.758 --> 00:26:12.239]  Will they notice pediatric cancer is up 10,000%?
[00:26:12.239 --> 00:26:15.479]  Will they notice breast cancer, depending on the types, up several thousand percent?
[00:26:15.479 --> 00:26:18.760]  Will they notice neurological disorders are up multi-thousand percent?
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.681]  Will they notice everything's exploding?
[00:26:21.954 --> 00:26:30.101]  And then they have groups that are fighting all the exploding diseases that never make it about why is it exploding to keep control of it.
[00:26:30.101 --> 00:26:31.682]  You are being murdered.
[00:26:31.682 --> 00:26:34.445]  I don't care what dumb color you are.
[00:26:34.445 --> 00:26:36.627]  Forget what color you are.
[00:26:36.627 --> 00:26:37.988]  It's eugenics.
[00:26:37.988 --> 00:26:42.392]  You're under attack and you better understand it or it's over.
[00:26:42.392 --> 00:26:44.714]  And once people pull back and think they go, yeah, this is actually true.
[00:26:47.503 --> 00:26:50.084]  Why does no one ask why there's all these new cancers?
[00:26:50.084 --> 00:26:59.429]  It's like the New York Times on Monday had the headline, scientists now ponder and brace for the fact that looks like cancer is actually communicable.
[00:26:59.429 --> 00:27:08.853]  Oh my, and next tomorrow there's something we just invented called a wheel.
[00:27:08.853 --> 00:27:14.816]  They have known for 100 years, in major university papers you can pull up,
[00:27:15.714 --> 00:27:18.457]  The cancer is mainly viral.
[00:27:18.457 --> 00:27:23.743]  And when your autoimmune system shuts down to the viral cancer, it grows and you die.
[00:27:23.743 --> 00:27:28.668]  You go, Alex, we heard this the last three days.
[00:27:28.668 --> 00:27:31.651]  I know, it's a big deal.
[00:27:31.651 --> 00:27:33.673]  It's a big deal.
[00:27:33.673 --> 00:27:37.758]  You need to be told when you're around someone that has cancer that it's communicable.
[00:27:39.113 --> 00:27:40.914]  That their feces is communicable.
[00:27:40.914 --> 00:27:42.395]  That their urine is communicable.
[00:27:42.395 --> 00:27:45.297]  And you're like, well, I have an immune system, that's right.
[00:27:45.297 --> 00:27:47.719]  And it has to battle too many times, it turns off.
[00:27:47.719 --> 00:27:49.760]  And look, everybody's immune systems are whacked out.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.241]  Everybody's got allergies or sick.
[00:27:51.241 --> 00:27:54.383]  Our bodies are going, I don't know what's going on, but I'm fighting for my life!
[00:27:54.383 --> 00:27:56.505]  They're like, drowning in the waves.
[00:27:56.505 --> 00:27:59.406]  Please, God, keep me alive!
[00:27:59.406 --> 00:28:02.268]  And then it's like, everything's fine.
[00:28:02.268 --> 00:28:03.089]  Everything's fine!
[00:28:03.089 --> 00:28:04.570]  The government loves you!
[00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:05.831]  Bill Gates loves you!
[00:28:07.503 --> 00:28:11.586]  He's going to make you take vaccines from the mosquitoes and from food it's engineered into.
[00:28:11.586 --> 00:28:12.947]  Because he loves you.
[00:28:12.947 --> 00:28:16.389]  Because his daddy was in black ops and ran Planned Parenthood.
[00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:20.552]  And we don't just abort babies, we abort people.
[00:28:20.552 --> 00:28:25.275]  But we do it slowly and suck all the money out of them first.
[00:28:25.275 --> 00:28:28.697]  You think the IRS is the only predatory group?
[00:28:28.697 --> 00:28:31.399]  They're the sweetie pies.
[00:28:31.399 --> 00:28:35.782]  And if you don't grow up, folks, they're going to murder you and your family.
[00:28:35.782 --> 00:28:36.643]  Just remember that.
[00:28:37.865 --> 00:28:39.967]  Including everybody that works for them.
[00:28:39.967 --> 00:28:44.431]  When they're done, they're gonna kill almost everyone if they carry out their plan.
[00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:54.661]  And don't say you weren't warned!
[00:28:54.661 --> 00:28:57.083]  I ran into a Navy SEAL this morning that I didn't know was a listener.
[00:28:57.083 --> 00:28:58.164]  And I know the fellow that knows him.
[00:28:58.164 --> 00:28:59.626]  That's why I knew after he left he was a Navy SEAL.
[00:29:02.825 --> 00:29:03.907]  I look like Chris Kyle.
[00:29:03.907 --> 00:29:05.468]  Talks like Chris Kyle.
[00:29:05.468 --> 00:29:10.415]  And after he left I was talking to the fellow that ran the business I was at and he goes, oh yeah.
[00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:12.397]  And I just, the guy was just in awe talking to me.
[00:29:12.397 --> 00:29:14.019]  And then he left.
[00:29:14.019 --> 00:29:15.161]  Don't be in awe of me.
[00:29:15.161 --> 00:29:16.763]  You're as smart as I am or tougher than I am.
[00:29:16.763 --> 00:29:18.024]  You need to get in the info war.
[00:29:18.024 --> 00:29:19.086]  That's what I'm telling people!
[00:29:21.167 --> 00:29:22.448]  Don't be in awe of Alex Jones.
[00:29:22.448 --> 00:29:23.789]  I've just broken my conditioning.
[00:29:23.789 --> 00:29:25.190]  I see through the lies.
[00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:27.752]  I can see for miles and miles and miles.
[00:29:27.752 --> 00:29:28.853]  When we come back, I'm going to blitz through it.
[00:29:28.853 --> 00:29:30.314]  I'm going to get to these clips.
[00:29:30.314 --> 00:29:31.195]  I'm going to get to the news.
[00:29:31.195 --> 00:29:32.916]  I'm going to get to the war news.
[00:29:32.916 --> 00:29:35.438]  I'm going to get to all of it coming up.
[00:29:35.438 --> 00:29:39.542]  But of course the IRS is persecuting Donald Trump and Carson.
[00:29:39.542 --> 00:29:43.585]  They're the only two real candidates on the Republican side that aren't controlled in my view.
[00:29:44.801 --> 00:29:45.842]  It's all intimidation.
[00:29:45.842 --> 00:29:47.124]  Well, stop giving in to it!
[00:29:47.124 --> 00:29:49.066]  Audit me all you want, you filthy trash!
[00:29:49.066 --> 00:29:50.608]  I'm not scared of you murderers!
[00:29:50.608 --> 00:29:52.890]  You already killed everybody I know!
[00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:55.413]  You already killed most of my family!
[00:29:55.413 --> 00:29:56.815]  Bastards!
[00:29:56.815 --> 00:29:57.356]  I hate you!
[00:29:59.986 --> 00:30:06.732]  Someone on Twitter asks, Hey, if you're so against the left-right paradigm, then why do you only talk about the Republican candidates and not Bernie Sanders?
[00:30:06.732 --> 00:30:10.416]  Listen, the Sanders tax plan will destroy the middle class.
[00:30:10.416 --> 00:30:13.599]  You've got to loot the middle class because that's where the money is.
[00:30:13.599 --> 00:30:20.566]  According to the Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation, the Sanders tax plan will raise taxes on most Americans.
[00:30:20.566 --> 00:30:23.068]  It's a very big tax increase for everyone.
[00:30:23.328 --> 00:30:25.209]  Except those at the bottom.
[00:30:25.209 --> 00:30:33.095]  Everybody loves to get free stuff and politicians are always pitching the idea that the poor and middle class are going to get the benefits and the rich will pay for it.
[00:30:33.095 --> 00:30:38.198]  Americans received more than two trillion dollars in benefits from the federal government in 2014.
[00:30:38.198 --> 00:30:41.480]  Bernie wants to hike that amount exponentially.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:48.425]  The question is, where's the money going to come from after the middle class and the millionaires have been looted and the mega-rich flee the country?
[00:30:48.885 --> 00:30:54.346]  To find out in detail how the Sanders tax plan will destroy the middle class, visit InfoWars.com.
[00:30:58.579 --> 00:31:00.661]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[00:31:00.661 --> 00:31:01.882]  Try a bottle of it.
[00:31:01.882 --> 00:31:03.463]  Rob Dew joins us.
[00:31:03.463 --> 00:31:06.606]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[00:31:06.606 --> 00:31:07.687]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[00:31:07.687 --> 00:31:08.627]  I'd been working all day.
[00:31:08.627 --> 00:31:11.109]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[00:31:11.109 --> 00:31:12.530]  I get in here at 830.
[00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:14.432]  I was kind of run down.
[00:31:14.432 --> 00:31:16.394]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[00:31:16.394 --> 00:31:18.255]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[00:31:18.255 --> 00:31:20.097]  I got my bottle of Brainforce right there.
[00:31:20.097 --> 00:31:21.158]  I popped two of them.
[00:31:21.158 --> 00:31:25.281]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like everything just kind of clears up.
[00:31:25.421 --> 00:31:26.861]  It's got four and a half stars.
[00:31:26.861 --> 00:31:28.202]  People really love it.
[00:31:28.202 --> 00:31:28.802]  Read about it.
[00:31:28.802 --> 00:31:38.065]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[00:31:38.065 --> 00:31:42.146]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without BrainForce.
[00:31:42.146 --> 00:31:48.287]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more BrainForce and came in.
[00:31:48.287 --> 00:31:53.189]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:31:53.729 --> 00:31:55.410]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:58.872]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:31:58.872 --> 00:31:59.952]  Good, brother.
[00:31:59.952 --> 00:32:01.673]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:32:01.673 --> 00:32:03.634]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:32:03.634 --> 00:32:07.656]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:32:07.656 --> 00:32:08.417]  Well, thank you, brother.
[00:32:08.417 --> 00:32:12.699]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:32:12.699 --> 00:32:20.543]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:32:20.743 --> 00:32:24.105]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:32:24.105 --> 00:32:25.647]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:32:25.647 --> 00:32:28.529]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:32:28.529 --> 00:32:30.330]  They've made a ton of money there.
[00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:36.134]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[00:32:36.374 --> 00:32:38.175]  Or maximum potency.
[00:32:38.175 --> 00:32:48.378]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[00:32:48.378 --> 00:32:50.179]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[00:32:50.179 --> 00:32:57.121]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:33:08.718 --> 00:33:19.844]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:19.844 --> 00:33:32.512]  You better set me free!
[00:33:35.676 --> 00:33:38.878]  A little bit better than I used to be, because I'm alive.
[00:33:38.878 --> 00:33:40.699]  I'm alive!
[00:33:40.699 --> 00:33:46.744]  I don't have the virtual reality headset on as a slave being fed propaganda by the Matrix.
[00:33:46.744 --> 00:33:49.906]  I got the goggles off, my eyes wide open.
[00:33:49.906 --> 00:33:52.828]  Not wide shut.
[00:33:52.828 --> 00:33:57.811]  I'm a live wire, and all of you are live wires as well.
[00:33:57.811 --> 00:34:00.773]  Come on, baby!
[00:34:00.773 --> 00:34:02.094]  Gotta play with me.
[00:34:02.094 --> 00:34:02.935]  I'm your live wire.
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:09.321]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:34:09.321 --> 00:34:09.861]  to 3 p.m.
[00:34:09.861 --> 00:34:10.441]  Central.
[00:34:10.441 --> 00:34:12.342]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:12.342 --> 00:34:16.163]  Info Wars Live is in the fourth hour with our great crew hosting.
[00:34:16.163 --> 00:34:23.526]  I pop in quite a bit as well, special reports and more, and then I'll be back this Sunday hosting in-studio live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:34:23.526 --> 00:34:27.727]  Central for the Sunday transmission.
[00:34:27.727 --> 00:34:30.408]  Because there's too much news to just be on five days a week.
[00:34:31.874 --> 00:34:34.977]  Then of course, five nights a week we have the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:34:34.977 --> 00:34:48.152]  The crew did a great job covering the election via the Super Tuesday coming up, the final Republican debate before Super Tuesday, and the highlights of that are up on InfoWars.com as well.
[00:34:48.152 --> 00:34:51.195]  Our analysis highlights, but we're going to go to some of those clips right now.
[00:34:52.396 --> 00:35:04.679]  I have been so busy covering news and got so blown away when the New York Times writer came out and said kill Trump and it turned out that Scalia was in a Bohemian Grove Illuminati cult.
[00:35:04.679 --> 00:35:06.559]  At least this group was founded out of that.
[00:35:06.559 --> 00:35:12.721]  I'm not saying Scalia was part of it because they try to recruit people through these well-meaning sounding sub-secret societies.
[00:35:12.721 --> 00:35:14.361]  That's in the Illuminati papers.
[00:35:14.361 --> 00:35:17.022]  I got so blown away by that that
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:22.064]  I didn't get to a lot of the news that was really important yesterday, but I'm going to do that today.
[00:35:22.064 --> 00:35:24.686]  Again, big Trump insiders have been with us for an hour and a half.
[00:35:24.686 --> 00:35:27.569]  Roger Stone is going to be in studio starting at the start of the next hour.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:39.605]  But before I go any further, I've been so busy and so focused on that, that I have not told you about a huge special that we've been planning for months to launch.
[00:35:39.605 --> 00:35:44.228]  The only time we did something like this was during the 24-hour Money Bomb broadcast.
[00:35:44.228 --> 00:35:48.850]  So we literally only do things like this once a year.
[00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:56.594]  And they were going to launch it just on Monday alone, but I said, let's do it now through the weekend and then not extend it out past Monday.
[00:35:58.041 --> 00:35:59.381]  It's unprecedented.
[00:35:59.381 --> 00:36:01.402]  This is only going to come around every four years.
[00:36:01.402 --> 00:36:02.702]  It's the leap year sale.
[00:36:02.702 --> 00:36:04.782]  This is every four years.
[00:36:04.782 --> 00:36:09.183]  This is the leap year for February.
[00:36:09.183 --> 00:36:16.705]  And so unprecedented leap year sale, 30% off the entire store and free shipping.
[00:36:16.705 --> 00:36:19.725]  And many of the items already have discounts.
[00:36:19.725 --> 00:36:22.326]  So those discounts are going to pass through as well.
[00:36:22.326 --> 00:36:23.726]  We're losing money with
[00:36:24.046 --> 00:36:28.932]  Some of the items is a true loss leader, and it's only gonna come around every four years.
[00:36:28.932 --> 00:36:30.473]  Unprecedented leap year sale.
[00:36:30.473 --> 00:36:41.105]  This is bigger than Black Friday, and it helps fund the information warfare operation, obviously, that you see is hitting on all cylinders, whether it's survival shield, nascent ion, x2, the must have for everybody here.
[00:36:41.525 --> 00:36:47.630]  Oxy powder, liver shields back in stock, super male vitality sold out, super female vitality is in.
[00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:50.192]  We also, again, just have so many other great products.
[00:36:50.192 --> 00:37:07.766]  Hillary for Prison t-shirts, non-GMO seeds, high quality water filtration systems, books, videos, shortwave radios, knives, belt buckles, bottle breachers, the whole nine yards, 30% off and free shipping through this weekend.
[00:37:08.757 --> 00:37:09.598]  And through Monday.
[00:37:09.598 --> 00:37:10.620]  And then that's it.
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:13.384]  We are going to end it Tuesday.
[00:37:13.384 --> 00:37:15.287]  So, take advantage of this right now.
[00:37:15.287 --> 00:37:17.370]  No excuses, folks.
[00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:18.231]  You owe it to yourself.
[00:37:18.231 --> 00:37:20.735]  The Nutraceuticals available at mfulworthslife.com.
[00:37:20.735 --> 00:37:24.160]  If you try anything, do the X2, and do the Oxy Powder, and do the Liver Shield.
[00:37:24.781 --> 00:37:26.462]  And of course, the super male will blow you away.
[00:37:26.462 --> 00:37:31.804]  I mean, almost everybody I talked to, I think I talked to one person and they're already in super good shape that didn't see it.
[00:37:31.804 --> 00:37:38.086]  They're young, who didn't see a big result in their libido alone and attitude.
[00:37:38.086 --> 00:37:40.307]  I mean, it has just incredible reviews, 4.8 reviews.
[00:37:41.827 --> 00:37:50.294]  So check it all out, InfoWarsLive.com or 888-253-3139, and InfoWarsStore.com is just the big umbrella site.
[00:37:50.294 --> 00:37:56.959]  And we also, of course, have 10% off when you sign up for AutoShip, and I guess this passes through with that discount as well.
[00:37:56.959 --> 00:38:07.707]  So we never sell out for AutoShip, folks, because we hold back that amount so that whatever item it is that you don't want to be sold out, just sign up for AutoShip at InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[00:38:11.457 --> 00:38:23.828]  Okay, I want to get into, now that we've talked about the unprecedented leap year sale, going on every four years, never done it before, here it is, in four years we'll do it again.
[00:38:23.828 --> 00:38:26.250]  No excuse to not support the show now, folks.
[00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:29.492]  I want to thank you all for your support and salute you.
[00:38:29.492 --> 00:38:32.895]  The big issue here is, it's unprecedented.
[00:38:32.895 --> 00:38:36.879]  I have never, in history books, or since I've been alive,
[00:38:38.148 --> 00:39:01.137]  And since I've been politically involved, that's about 25, 26 years since high school, I have never, never, never seen world government, the Pope, the Chinese Communist murderers, Vicente Fox, the dirtbag ruler of what he sees as his peons, his slaves, just absolute enslaver.
[00:39:02.071 --> 00:39:05.254]  I have never seen the Democratic Party and its plantation slaves.
[00:39:05.254 --> 00:39:12.439]  I have never seen the Republican establishment, the sickening Karl Rove types, up there unified against someone.
[00:39:12.439 --> 00:39:16.422]  They are scared to death of Trump because they don't own him and they want to own him.
[00:39:16.422 --> 00:39:17.944]  Is Trump perfect?
[00:39:17.944 --> 00:39:20.526]  Obviously not.
[00:39:20.526 --> 00:39:21.386]  Is he an egomaniac?
[00:39:21.386 --> 00:39:22.867]  Will he turn into a Napoleon Bonaparte?
[00:39:22.867 --> 00:39:24.008]  I hope not.
[00:39:24.008 --> 00:39:24.829]  I know this, though.
[00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:31.014]  We know we've got a eugenics-based, scientific dictatorship running things that buys and sells politicians like baseball cards.
[00:39:33.615 --> 00:39:36.257]  And like pieces of art.
[00:39:36.257 --> 00:39:39.500]  And Trump has never really worked with them.
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:40.962]  He's never really been part of it.
[00:39:40.962 --> 00:39:44.305]  He's been a buyer of politicians.
[00:39:44.305 --> 00:39:45.826]  He's not been for sale.
[00:39:45.826 --> 00:39:46.987]  And he's been very naked about that.
[00:39:46.987 --> 00:39:48.028]  He goes, this is our system.
[00:39:48.028 --> 00:39:52.792]  If I want them to leave me alone, I've got to go give campaign contributions to everybody.
[00:39:52.792 --> 00:39:54.754]  And he's given hundreds and hundreds of millions.
[00:40:00.359 --> 00:40:01.720]  What Karl Rove says there.
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.382]  Karl Rove says time is running out to beat Donald Trump.
[00:40:04.382 --> 00:40:05.623]  Oh, give me a break.
[00:40:05.623 --> 00:40:08.125]  And that just came out yesterday.
[00:40:08.125 --> 00:40:09.165]  And they are creeping around.
[00:40:09.165 --> 00:40:28.920]  And they're even foisting the old, sad, obviously senile George Herbert Walker Bush up there with Barbara to make everybody feel sorry for him and love him to try to put some sicky sweet icing on the Bush dynasty of Democrats that took over the Republican Party with the Rockefellers and literally turned it into a criminal enterprise.
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:41.247]  No one more single-handedly has sabotaged the conservative, paleo-conservative, constitutionalist movement than George Herbert Walker, I love world government, New World Order Bush.
[00:40:41.247 --> 00:40:48.271]  And we can see a new world coming into view, with the very real prospects of a New World Order.
[00:40:48.271 --> 00:40:51.834]  And we will have a New World Order.
[00:40:51.834 --> 00:40:53.895]  And you find out what a New World Order is, it ain't good.
[00:40:55.526 --> 00:40:56.367]  So that is a big deal.
[00:40:56.367 --> 00:40:57.887]  But let's go to more of these clips.
[00:40:57.887 --> 00:41:03.851]  Donald Trump, again I put it earlier, says he hasn't released his taxes because you're not supposed to during an audit.
[00:41:03.851 --> 00:41:05.452]  And he's released them months and months.
[00:41:05.452 --> 00:41:11.956]  He's talking about releasing them months and months before Mitt Romney, who wouldn't release his until days before the election.
[00:41:14.453 --> 00:41:16.435]  And let's say Trump isn't perfect.
[00:41:16.435 --> 00:41:30.364]  The IRS is a criminal enterprise, unconstitutional, set up in 1913, that runs around, admittedly, even the New York Times admits, they'll go into a lady that's for 40-something years owned a Mexican diner in New York that only seats like 10 people.
[00:41:30.364 --> 00:41:34.627]  It's in an old, like, bus, you know, one of those old-fashioned 50s style things.
[00:41:34.627 --> 00:41:35.888]  I've read the article on there many times.
[00:41:37.165 --> 00:41:40.988]  And they said, no, we know you deposit less than $1,000 a day at night when you close.
[00:41:40.988 --> 00:41:43.570]  She only does breakfast and lunch into the afternoon.
[00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:45.432]  You know, those old family diners.
[00:41:45.432 --> 00:41:47.614]  One lady doing it all.
[00:41:47.614 --> 00:41:49.295]  Cooking and everything.
[00:41:49.295 --> 00:41:50.416]  Cooking it.
[00:41:50.416 --> 00:41:51.657]  Giving you your order.
[00:41:51.657 --> 00:41:52.998]  Taking your cash.
[00:41:52.998 --> 00:41:54.379]  Old lady drives over.
[00:41:54.379 --> 00:41:56.741]  She's been there since she was a young woman.
[00:41:56.741 --> 00:41:57.442]  Puts the money in the bank.
[00:41:59.039 --> 00:42:06.721]  Paid all our taxes, and they said, oh, we know you paid all the money, but we can say according to the law, we interpret it as structuring, because it's under $1,000.
[00:42:06.721 --> 00:42:10.502]  Oh, but over $10,000 is structuring, but under $10,000 is too.
[00:42:10.502 --> 00:42:16.084]  And we're just going to take, the average deposit is like $400 a day.
[00:42:16.084 --> 00:42:23.126]  After all the expenses and the food and the electricity and the taxes, I bet that woman was maybe bringing home $600, $700 a week.
[00:42:23.126 --> 00:42:23.726]  It's a poor working lady.
[00:42:26.892 --> 00:42:35.438]  IRS took her life savings, 30-something thousand dollars, and they did it to more than 50,000 people in 2014 alone.
[00:42:35.438 --> 00:42:35.939]  That was in 2014.
[00:42:35.939 --> 00:42:38.801]  They go, hey, we know you paid!
[00:42:38.801 --> 00:42:44.325]  It's like they told my dad in the 80s.
[00:42:44.325 --> 00:42:45.206]  He comes in and he goes,
[00:42:47.315 --> 00:42:50.038]  I mean, my dad would take me to Ronald Reagan speeches.
[00:42:50.038 --> 00:42:52.560]  My dad would take me to Air Force bases to see air shows.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.941]  My dad, just, oh, the U.S.
[00:42:53.941 --> 00:42:54.622]  government.
[00:42:54.622 --> 00:42:55.783]  Other governments are corrupt.
[00:42:55.783 --> 00:42:58.105]  Ours has got problems, but it's the best there is.
[00:42:58.105 --> 00:42:59.086]  It's so good.
[00:42:59.086 --> 00:43:00.107]  America's so good.
[00:43:00.107 --> 00:43:02.690]  I mean, my dad was like Dudley Do-Right.
[00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:07.194]  Really smart, but just Americana all the way.
[00:43:07.194 --> 00:43:08.696]  Volunteered for all sorts of stuff.
[00:43:12.745 --> 00:43:20.133]  He was just dumbfounded when an arm of the government told him, Dr. Jones, we don't want your receipts or to talk to your lawyer.
[00:43:20.133 --> 00:43:21.774]  We're organized crime.
[00:43:21.774 --> 00:43:22.475]  Pay us the money.
[00:43:22.475 --> 00:43:26.980]  We're going to take your house, your cars, and maybe even put you in prison.
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:31.264]  It was a fat lady in there saying this to him.
[00:43:31.264 --> 00:43:32.485]  And my dad said, well, I'm going to fight you.
[00:43:32.485 --> 00:43:33.827]  And he fought him for like 10 years.
[00:43:36.383 --> 00:43:38.985]  And finally settled for less than what they've been saying.
[00:43:38.985 --> 00:43:39.785]  It was all made up.
[00:43:39.785 --> 00:43:42.447]  And I remember my dad was just like, what the?
[00:43:42.447 --> 00:43:45.028]  He's like, I remember at the dinner table going, they said we're criminals.
[00:43:45.028 --> 00:43:46.889]  My mom was like, really, David?
[00:43:46.889 --> 00:43:49.811]  Yeah, they said we're criminals.
[00:43:49.811 --> 00:43:53.753]  They said we're criminals.
[00:43:53.753 --> 00:43:58.716]  That was in 1988, the minute George Herbert Walker Bush got in office.
[00:43:58.716 --> 00:44:01.378]  He had a retroactive tax and penalties.
[00:44:05.182 --> 00:44:11.207]  That fat slob, couldn't walk upstairs, never been in a fight, wasn't tough, but had this government behind her.
[00:44:11.207 --> 00:44:14.530]  And she just looked at him and said, we're organized criminals.
[00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:15.671]  He goes, what do you mean?
[00:44:15.671 --> 00:44:18.694]  She goes, we're white collar criminals.
[00:44:18.694 --> 00:44:23.418]  You give us everything.
[00:44:23.418 --> 00:44:31.445]  I mean, even corrupt Italian mafia at its worst didn't go into, you know, regular businesses and say, give us everything or we're going to kill you.
[00:44:31.445 --> 00:44:32.566]  They just say, give us a little piece.
[00:44:33.544 --> 00:44:37.566]  But that's what we live under in bondage in this country.
[00:44:37.566 --> 00:44:41.287]  And that's who we are.
[00:44:41.287 --> 00:44:43.008]  And you know why the Soviet Union collapsed?
[00:44:43.008 --> 00:44:44.048]  Why Venezuela's collapsing?
[00:44:44.048 --> 00:44:45.289]  My dad just pulled his...
[00:44:46.564 --> 00:44:53.628]  Feelers back in the 90s and just didn't work as much and didn't own things and sold his business and just pulled back.
[00:44:53.628 --> 00:44:57.391]  And then two years ago, because of Obamacare, he's in medical consulting.
[00:44:57.391 --> 00:44:58.992]  He said, Oh, I'm just getting out completely.
[00:44:58.992 --> 00:45:06.537]  It's written where no one can follow the law so they can selectively shake down all the medical facilities and all the mom and pop dental offices.
[00:45:06.537 --> 00:45:13.201]  But all the big mega hospitals are basically exempt and above the law because they pay money to the politicians and the key law firms.
[00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:20.773]  Law firms run by people like Eric Holder, who's above the law.
[00:45:20.773 --> 00:45:22.453]  And my dad says, I'm not an organized criminal.
[00:45:22.453 --> 00:45:30.136]  I'm not going to be involved, and I'm not going to go to the state houses, and I'm not going to go rub elbows, and I'm not going to be a lobbyist, and I'm not going to do all of this.
[00:45:30.136 --> 00:45:32.017]  I'm done.
[00:45:32.017 --> 00:45:33.738]  I'm not going to deliver checks to everybody.
[00:45:34.758 --> 00:45:37.961]  And he said, so it's Atlas Shrugged.
[00:45:37.961 --> 00:45:41.243]  America will now collapse!
[00:45:41.243 --> 00:45:48.389]  All the filthy Bernie dummies, all the stupid yuppies that can't even talk, are gonna get what you want.
[00:45:48.389 --> 00:45:51.151]  Poverty and the end of prosperity.
[00:45:51.151 --> 00:45:55.675]  And you're so stupid, you won't even know you helped do it.
[00:45:55.675 --> 00:45:59.518]  Because you're dumb cowards, like your soft, stupid, filthy parents.
[00:46:01.963 --> 00:46:03.104]  And here's the problem I have.
[00:46:03.104 --> 00:46:08.967]  I don't have some new country I can run to with other hard workers to build, you know, the new Atlantis.
[00:46:08.967 --> 00:46:13.450]  You people have come in, taken it over, gotten lazy, crapped all over it.
[00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:17.352]  Thanks a lot, filth!
[00:46:17.352 --> 00:46:19.954]  Selective enforcement of the law is the first sign of tyranny.
[00:46:24.605 --> 00:46:28.729]  That's a Washington Times headline, Obama Waiver Corruption Must Stop.
[00:46:28.729 --> 00:46:33.915]  Oh yeah, thousands of Democrat companies, unions are all exempt from rape care.
[00:46:34.932 --> 00:46:39.914]  And then they have, because Obama can do whatever he wants with Obamacare, that's how it's written, he can give them actually good deals.
[00:46:39.914 --> 00:46:40.734]  Like the emperor!
[00:46:40.734 --> 00:46:42.075]  Oh, you actually get free healthcare.
[00:46:42.075 --> 00:46:44.536]  And you do.
[00:46:44.536 --> 00:46:48.117]  But no federal aid for Texas and wildfires.
[00:46:48.117 --> 00:46:53.199]  And no, no, no, nothing for someone that made $100,000 a year for 20 years.
[00:46:53.199 --> 00:46:55.681]  You're, you're, it's tripled on you!
[00:46:55.681 --> 00:46:59.822]  We're gonna punish you while we fly around in jumbo jets and have red carpets.
[00:46:59.822 --> 00:47:01.163]  We're gonna screw you over.
[00:47:07.165 --> 00:47:09.748]  And then Cuomo sits up there with Trump and goes, what?
[00:47:09.748 --> 00:47:13.973]  You're claiming the IRS plans against people?
[00:47:13.973 --> 00:47:17.757]  How ridiculous!
[00:47:17.757 --> 00:47:23.343]  Talking down to their prey, their stupid servile viewers.
[00:47:23.343 --> 00:47:24.605]  But here's the deal.
[00:47:24.605 --> 00:47:27.388]  About half the country's hardworking and smarter than every race, color, and creed.
[00:47:30.658 --> 00:47:37.343]  And more and more people are just saying, I'm not paying the IRS, and I'm not getting a driver's license, and I'm gonna act just like an illegal alien, and I'm gonna do whatever I want.
[00:47:37.343 --> 00:47:39.884]  In fact, I know people that are wealthy that are doing it now.
[00:47:39.884 --> 00:47:42.926]  They're pulling out of business, and they're not following anything anymore.
[00:47:42.926 --> 00:47:46.829]  They're like, you're a bunch of lawless crooks, I'm not following any of it now!
[00:47:46.829 --> 00:47:52.413]  And I'm not going out and looking for trouble in camo with an M16 to fight the poor police.
[00:47:52.413 --> 00:47:59.617]  I'm pulling out of your system, I'm not part of it, and if anybody ever tries to go put me in a forced labor camp, I'm going to protect myself.
[00:48:00.563 --> 00:48:08.909]  And you'll see how many people want to step on a porcupine barefoot.
[00:48:08.909 --> 00:48:10.750]  You've messed with the smart people long enough.
[00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:14.212]  All right, let's start getting these clips.
[00:48:14.212 --> 00:48:17.875]  I'm ranting.
[00:48:17.875 --> 00:48:20.577]  Let's go to this Marco Rubio and Donald Trump vicious debate battle.
[00:48:20.577 --> 00:48:24.319]  Then we'll go to Donald Trump calling Cruz a liar.
[00:48:24.319 --> 00:48:24.840]  Let's go.
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.361]  And he has been lying about Trump.
[00:48:27.361 --> 00:48:27.962]  Let's go to those clips.
[00:48:29.545 --> 00:48:38.081]  If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, he'll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it.
[00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:39.624]  Such a cute soundbite.
[00:48:41.298 --> 00:48:45.542]  Here's a guy that buys a house for $179,000.
[00:48:45.542 --> 00:48:51.787]  He sells it to a lobbyist, who's probably here, for $380,000, and then legislation is passed.
[00:48:51.787 --> 00:48:53.469]  You tell me about this guy.
[00:48:53.469 --> 00:48:54.990]  This is what we're going to have as president.
[00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:57.052]  Here's a guy that inherited $200 million.
[00:48:57.052 --> 00:49:00.014]  If he hadn't inherited $200 million, you know where Donald Trump would be right now?
[00:49:00.014 --> 00:49:00.214]  No, no, no.
[00:49:00.214 --> 00:49:00.475]  No, no, no.
[00:49:00.475 --> 00:49:01.696]  Selling watches in Manhattan.
[00:49:03.217 --> 00:49:05.037]  I have to say, he lied this time.
[00:49:05.037 --> 00:49:07.038]  He lied.
[00:49:07.038 --> 00:49:07.439]  100%.
[00:49:07.439 --> 00:49:08.079]  100%.
[00:49:08.079 --> 00:49:09.299]  You lied about the Polish workers?
[00:49:09.299 --> 00:49:10.320]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:12.101]  You lied to the students of Trump University?
[00:49:12.101 --> 00:49:13.502]  That's Senator Bush talking.
[00:49:13.502 --> 00:49:14.302]  He lied 38 years ago.
[00:49:14.302 --> 00:49:17.123]  Alright, I guess there's a statute of limitation on lies.
[00:49:17.123 --> 00:49:19.585]  See, Trump is goofy looking, but he's toad-like.
[00:49:19.585 --> 00:49:24.347]  Rubio literally looks like a little greebling mouse or something.
[00:49:24.347 --> 00:49:25.467]  A rat.
[00:49:25.467 --> 00:49:27.348]  Who are the guys on the Star Trek episodes?
[00:49:27.348 --> 00:49:28.369]  Those aliens have the big ears?
[00:49:29.721 --> 00:49:30.881]  Ferengi.
[00:49:30.881 --> 00:49:32.382]  I'm not sure he's from this planet.
[00:49:32.382 --> 00:49:34.643]  I think he may be a Ferengi.
[00:49:34.643 --> 00:49:36.623]  They'll have the media say it's some racist attack.
[00:49:36.623 --> 00:49:37.624]  No, it's not.
[00:49:37.624 --> 00:49:39.764]  Trump looks like a giant toad, a golden toad.
[00:49:39.764 --> 00:49:41.745]  He looks ridiculous.
[00:49:41.745 --> 00:49:42.805]  Let's just be honest.
[00:49:42.805 --> 00:49:46.186]  And then Rubio looks like a Ferengi.
[00:49:49.571 --> 00:49:50.793]  Cruz looks like a wooden man.
[00:49:50.793 --> 00:49:52.134]  I mean, and I look like a pumpkin head.
[00:49:52.134 --> 00:49:54.798]  It's just, I mean, there is Rubio without his wig.
[00:49:54.798 --> 00:49:58.583]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to this other clip here as we go to break.
[00:49:58.583 --> 00:50:01.086]  Let's go to Donald Trump calls Ted Cruz a liar.
[00:50:01.086 --> 00:50:01.367]  Here it is.
[00:50:03.007 --> 00:50:05.430]  You are all talk and no action.
[00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:10.455]  What I've seen up here, I mean, first of all, this guy's a choke artist and this guy's a liar.
[00:50:10.455 --> 00:50:14.679]  You have a combination of factors.
[00:50:14.679 --> 00:50:19.904]  He can't do it for the obvious reason and he can't do it because he doesn't know how to tell the truth.
[00:50:19.904 --> 00:50:21.546]  What we're seeing with Donald.
[00:50:23.397 --> 00:50:32.244]  Is actually the pattern of Washington, the pattern of Washington dealmakers, which is they make promises, they break their words, and then when anyone calls them on it, they call you a liar.
[00:50:32.244 --> 00:50:34.206]  And so that's Donald's pattern over and over again.
[00:50:34.206 --> 00:50:40.932]  And every time anyone points at Donald's actual record, what he said on national television, Donald yells liar.
[00:50:40.932 --> 00:50:41.892]  Let me tell you something.
[00:50:41.892 --> 00:50:46.376]  Falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie, and it's something Donald does daily.
[00:50:46.376 --> 00:50:46.917]  Go ahead, Mr. Trump.
[00:50:49.594 --> 00:50:51.276]  We're gonna come back with more.
[00:50:51.276 --> 00:50:55.299]  I'm gonna get some more of these clips and we got the big Trump insider coming in studio here real quick.

[00:51:59.824 --> 00:52:03.545]  I'm just a sweet old lady who needs help crossing the street.
[00:52:03.545 --> 00:52:08.986]  But the real reason I want to get to the other side is so I can steal your identity along the way.
[00:52:08.986 --> 00:52:15.688]  While you're holding onto my hand, the RFID reader in my purse is capturing all your personal information.
[00:52:15.688 --> 00:52:19.949]  Debit cards, credit cards, even your work ID badge isn't safe.
[00:52:19.949 --> 00:52:22.689]  Oh, you have an RFID chipped subway pass?
[00:52:22.689 --> 00:52:24.110]  Well now, so do I!

[00:53:28.215 --> 00:53:29.477]  Attention, citizens.
[00:53:29.477 --> 00:53:35.604]  This man has received national attention for accurately predicting every major financial trend, including the market crash of 2008.
[00:53:35.604 --> 00:53:37.607]  His name is Harry Dent.
[00:53:37.947 --> 00:53:45.749]  And in his newly released book, he is making even bigger and bolder predictions that have the potential to devastate the world economy and your personal wealth.
[00:53:45.749 --> 00:53:54.591]  You can get a free copy of Harry Dent's bestseller, The Demographic Cliff, containing never-before-published information by simply visiting www.harrydentresearch.com.

[00:54:03.655 --> 00:54:12.187]  These elites are so arrogant that Vicente Fox is now doubled down on CNBC and used more cuss words to get attention.
[00:54:12.187 --> 00:54:17.454]  He's trying to rally all the illegals that are as loyal to the failed state of Mexico to go vote.
[00:54:18.607 --> 00:54:25.437]  And Chris Christie has come out saying that he's endorsing Donald Trump because he's quote, rewritten the playbook on American politics.
[00:54:25.437 --> 00:54:34.250]  Yeah, he's not spending advertising money with the political class and the lobbyists and the whore, prostitute political pundits like Fox, CNN, MSNBC.
[00:54:35.091 --> 00:54:42.055]  Billions are spent with these networks every major election cycle, especially a presidential cycle, and they want that money.
[00:54:42.055 --> 00:54:43.315]  They want to rule it.
[00:54:43.315 --> 00:54:52.840]  They're the ones, you notice, the very pundits at local, regional, and national, that tell you how the cow ate the cabbage, and then you're supposed to just go along with it all.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:55:00.144]  Well, this just in, just on Fox in the control room, Chris Christie has endorsed him, and Donald Trump is rewriting the playbook.
[00:55:00.144 --> 00:55:01.685]  He's breaking the political system.
[00:55:03.015 --> 00:55:05.680]  This is like the Rebels blowing up the Death Star, folks.
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:10.127]  Doesn't mean the Empire's beaten, but it's a devastating, game-changing reversal.
[00:55:11.007 --> 00:55:23.229]  It's like in the final quarter and team seven behind and then the other team starts getting, you know, two fumbles and now the home team is seven points ahead and we've only got five minutes left in the game.
[00:55:23.229 --> 00:55:25.150]  We are winning now.
[00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:26.850]  But we have to believe we're winning.
[00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:32.111]  We have this loser attitude that you can't change, you can't fight City Hall death and taxes.
[00:55:32.111 --> 00:55:34.052]  That's not true.
[00:55:34.052 --> 00:55:35.012]  Taxes aren't like death.
[00:55:36.238 --> 00:55:39.761]  Illegitimate, unconstitutional taxes can and will be reversed.
[00:55:39.761 --> 00:55:47.347]  Especially when the public learns that 47% of the public doesn't pay taxes and then the elites don't pay taxes.
[00:55:47.347 --> 00:55:51.470]  Why does 53% of us have to pay for everything and be lectured all day?
[00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:55.433]  So let's finish up with that clip we were getting into with Donald Trump calling them liars.
[00:55:55.433 --> 00:55:57.315]  Donald Trump calls Ted Cruz a liar again.
[00:55:57.315 --> 00:55:57.615]  Here it is.
[00:56:03.370 --> 00:56:05.331]  You are all talk and no action.
[00:56:05.331 --> 00:56:10.353]  What I've seen up here, I mean, first of all, this guy's a choke artist and this guy's a liar.
[00:56:10.353 --> 00:56:14.575]  You have a combination of factors.
[00:56:14.575 --> 00:56:19.817]  He can't do it for the obvious reason and he can't do it because he doesn't know how to tell the truth.
[00:56:19.817 --> 00:56:21.458]  What we're seeing with Donald.
[00:56:23.311 --> 00:56:32.153]  ...is actually the pattern of Washington, the pattern of Washington dealmakers, which is they make promises, they break their words, and then when anyone calls them on it, they call you a liar.
[00:56:32.153 --> 00:56:34.194]  And so that's Donald's pattern over and over again.
[00:56:34.194 --> 00:56:44.236]  No, the truth is he didn't support Obamacare, and the truth is Cruz is the one that's been engaged in dirty tricks, and the truth is Cruz is in love with the Bush dynasty and could be basically a sleeper operative of these people.
[00:56:44.236 --> 00:56:49.298]  And I'm not trying to become an enemy of Ted Cruz, but he's the one that's been playing dirty.
[00:56:49.298 --> 00:56:49.878]  It's a fact.
[00:56:50.658 --> 00:56:54.824]  And I like a lot of stuff Cruz does, but I tell you, they need to just get behind Trump.
[00:56:54.824 --> 00:56:57.027]  They need to understand the whole system's against him.
[00:56:57.027 --> 00:56:58.870]  They're not going to win in these primaries.
[00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:00.592]  The system will destroy them as well.
[00:57:00.592 --> 00:57:02.394]  The system is scared of Trump.
[00:57:02.394 --> 00:57:05.358]  Now here is Rubio attacks Trump over hiring illegal workers.
[00:57:06.627 --> 00:57:08.269]  I know how this works.
[00:57:08.269 --> 00:57:11.634]  I know how this works at these hotels and at these cruise ships and all the rest of it.
[00:57:11.634 --> 00:57:15.620]  These are registered through worker systems that come through seasonally.
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:18.884]  It's at resorts all over the country and all over the world.
[00:57:18.884 --> 00:57:23.470]  You can be down at a resort in Mexico and there's people from Russia and Germany and Poland and Australia.
[00:57:24.151 --> 00:57:27.152]  I mean, that's how these work services work.
[00:57:27.152 --> 00:57:28.033]  It's legal.
[00:57:28.033 --> 00:57:31.214]  But Rubio sits there and plays these games.
[00:57:31.214 --> 00:57:32.675]  I thought he's this big racist.
[00:57:32.675 --> 00:57:35.036]  Trump has never been against workers in the country.
[00:57:35.036 --> 00:57:36.256]  He wants them here legally.
[00:57:36.256 --> 00:57:37.937]  Let's go to the clip.
[00:57:37.937 --> 00:57:48.362]  But I also think that if you're going to claim that you're the only one that lifted this into the campaign, that you acknowledge that, for example, you're the only person on the stage that's ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.
[00:57:48.362 --> 00:57:49.382]  You hired some workers from Poland.
[00:57:49.382 --> 00:57:51.683]  No, no, I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people.
[00:57:51.683 --> 00:57:52.824]  You haven't hired anybody.
[00:57:55.212 --> 00:57:57.994]  You've hired tens of thousands of people.
[00:57:57.994 --> 00:57:59.555]  Some are going to have fake documents.
[00:58:11.623 --> 00:58:14.507]  And that's because the company didn't follow the paperwork right.
[00:58:30.586 --> 00:58:34.249]  I've hired tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
[00:58:34.249 --> 00:58:35.029]  Tens of thousands.
[00:58:35.029 --> 00:58:36.490]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:38.732]  Rubio has that, you know what, eatin' grin.
[00:58:38.732 --> 00:58:40.013]  We'll be back.
[00:58:40.013 --> 00:58:40.873]  We'll be back, folks.
[00:58:40.873 --> 00:58:43.555]  Roger Stone is coming in at the 5 after Trump Insider.
[00:58:43.555 --> 00:58:44.576]  Tell your friends and family, tune in.
[00:58:48.757 --> 00:58:52.259]  Infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.
[00:58:52.259 --> 00:58:57.861]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:58:57.861 --> 00:59:06.225]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[00:59:06.225 --> 00:59:11.868]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[00:59:12.348 --> 00:59:21.432]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy-to-use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:59:21.432 --> 00:59:27.654]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:59:27.654 --> 00:59:34.417]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:59:34.417 --> 00:59:39.459]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[00:59:43.824 --> 00:59:45.426]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:59.915 --> 01:00:05.318]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:05.318 --> 01:00:07.659]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:00:07.659 --> 01:00:15.443]  I was reading this morning where Harvard and Yale are getting rid of the term master.
[01:00:15.443 --> 01:00:19.806]  Now, master means a master of baseball, a master of golf, a master.
[01:00:19.806 --> 01:00:23.668]  We call Rembrandt a master of classical painting.
[01:00:23.668 --> 01:00:27.350]  But because somewhere in the world they also call someone a slave master,
[01:00:28.689 --> 01:00:30.450]  Has thousands of different uses.
[01:00:30.450 --> 01:00:31.770]  Now that word must be banned.
[01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:32.391]  There it is.
[01:00:32.391 --> 01:00:38.814]  Harvard abolishes master in titles in slavery fight.
[01:00:38.814 --> 01:00:41.275]  Students claim the title had echoes of slavery.
[01:00:41.275 --> 01:00:46.317]  Just like at other universities, they want the word and they are doing it.
[01:00:46.317 --> 01:00:48.438]  Lynch removed off buildings.
[01:00:48.438 --> 01:00:50.799]  Well, the Attorney General's last name is Lynch.
[01:00:50.799 --> 01:00:53.180]  It's an Irish last name.
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:54.381]  Has nothing to do with lynching.
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:01.903]  It was a case of a family that reportedly hung one of their other family members who were named Lynch, so you get the name Lynch.
[01:01:01.903 --> 01:01:04.925]  But it has nothing to do, this is the mental illness.
[01:01:04.925 --> 01:01:07.207]  Talk about a pathetic brainwashed population.
[01:01:07.207 --> 01:01:09.048]  There's no jobs, there's no future.
[01:01:09.048 --> 01:01:12.130]  They know how to fight with each other though.
[01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:19.174]  And say, change the name of the hall after the person that helped pay for it, a benefactor, because we're scared by the word Lynch.
[01:01:19.174 --> 01:01:25.938]  And take down Martin Luther King's quotes too, because he said, all God's children of every race, color and creed together on the mountain.
[01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.258]  They said, what about transgendered?
[01:01:29.258 --> 01:01:30.538]  You didn't say women.
[01:01:30.538 --> 01:01:36.200]  It's craziness where everything can be attached to being upset and being a basket case.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:39.362]  This is trained brainwashing mental illness.
[01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:48.025]  You notice that professor that says your kids don't belong to you, Melissa Harris Perry, you've watched her show, she's just, now wait a minute, don't say that this congressman's a hard worker.
[01:01:48.025 --> 01:01:50.146]  That disparages black slaves.
[01:01:50.146 --> 01:01:50.686]  Well, wait a minute.
[01:01:51.598 --> 01:02:01.691]  Wait a minute, and then she takes anything you can imagine and then ties it to that to make the constituents just these mentally ill basket cases that are totally freaked out.
[01:02:01.691 --> 01:02:06.097]  And then I told folks, I don't celebrate a cultic Halloween, but I'll go to a costume party.
[01:02:07.145 --> 01:02:12.808]  And I went as a, wearing an airline captain hat, because I couldn't find a captain hat.
[01:02:12.808 --> 01:02:14.989]  We went on a little birthday party thing.
[01:02:14.989 --> 01:02:16.069]  Somebody else's birthday on Halloween.
[01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:18.831]  It was the day after, but it was on Halloween, on a thing on the river.
[01:02:18.831 --> 01:02:20.311]  So I said, I'll just wear a captain hat.
[01:02:20.311 --> 01:02:21.752]  That's my costume.
[01:02:21.752 --> 01:02:25.093]  And then I went to a couple of parties after that, and I had people come up to me.
[01:02:25.093 --> 01:02:30.676]  White guys, women, an Arab fellow, and go, what are you, some kind of Nazi?
[01:02:30.676 --> 01:02:31.917]  And there I was wearing a,
[01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:37.706]  You know, like, purple jeans and a black shirt and a cap.
[01:02:37.706 --> 01:02:38.827]  And I went, what do you mean?
[01:02:38.827 --> 01:02:39.847]  That was like a Nazi thing.
[01:02:39.847 --> 01:02:40.608]  You know, the Nazis hurt.
[01:02:40.608 --> 01:02:41.989]  I was just like, what?
[01:02:41.989 --> 01:02:42.889]  I go, oh, I get it.
[01:02:42.889 --> 01:02:45.131]  I'm white and I'm wearing a police hat.
[01:02:45.131 --> 01:02:46.171]  Kind of looks like a police hat.
[01:02:46.171 --> 01:02:47.232]  I'm a Nazi.
[01:02:47.232 --> 01:02:48.833]  I went, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:48.833 --> 01:02:52.435]  Go ahead and be morally superior to me and tell me how great you are.
[01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:54.357]  That just gave yourself a degree above me.
[01:02:54.357 --> 01:02:56.138]  Because the truth is, you're a racist.
[01:02:56.966 --> 01:02:59.727]  Even if you're white pushing all this, it's just all you're into.
[01:02:59.727 --> 01:03:07.509]  I'm into art, literature, good food, friends, having fun outdoors, you know, going out and water skiing or wakeboarding.
[01:03:07.509 --> 01:03:16.532]  I'm just into, you know, having a good time, being a good person, looking at the stars through a telescope, swimming in a swimming pool, you know, grilling steaks.
[01:03:16.532 --> 01:03:25.355]  I want to be friends with everybody and you just want to run around and test what you've been taught, what your worthless degrees are in, is ninnying and freaking out and control freaking on everybody.
[01:03:27.898 --> 01:03:28.919]  Then I have these headlines.
[01:03:28.919 --> 01:03:30.881]  Leftist pull fire alarm.
[01:03:30.881 --> 01:03:32.462]  It was a typo, not an alarm.
[01:03:32.462 --> 01:03:35.425]  Block entrance to stop conservative from speaking.
[01:03:35.425 --> 01:03:36.746]  That's out in California.
[01:03:36.746 --> 01:03:41.830]  Outrage as school calls police after pupil looks at UKIP website in class.
[01:03:41.830 --> 01:03:43.091]  There's no law against looking at it.
[01:03:43.091 --> 01:03:44.773]  It's a mainline libertarian party.
[01:03:44.773 --> 01:03:45.834]  Fastest growing in Europe.
[01:03:46.604 --> 01:03:59.773]  Remember, they arrested Marie Le Pen last year, and she's facing a year in prison, the presidential frontrunner, for saying France has not faced any threat to its sovereignty like this with the Muslim wave since Nazi Germany.
[01:03:59.773 --> 01:04:02.675]  And they arrested her.
[01:04:02.675 --> 01:04:07.018]  Because these are hardcore totalitarians.
[01:04:07.018 --> 01:04:14.623]  And if they can normalize hinpecking and bossing and controlling, I'm telling you, the folks that came up to me at those two different Halloween parties,
[01:04:17.332 --> 01:04:18.833]  It actually happened more than that, actually.
[01:04:18.833 --> 01:04:21.876]  We were running around that night.
[01:04:21.876 --> 01:04:25.740]  And it was just that I was, you know, a white guy in good shape.
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:30.744]  I guess I, you know, people joke and say I look like an Irish cop or something with a, looks like a cop hat on.
[01:04:30.744 --> 01:04:32.626]  And the thing was just get in my face.
[01:04:32.626 --> 01:04:33.867]  Tell me I'm bad.
[01:04:33.867 --> 01:04:36.269]  Peck at me that I'm racist.
[01:04:36.269 --> 01:04:38.492]  And it was just crazy.
[01:04:38.492 --> 01:04:39.813]  Absolutely crazy.
[01:04:39.813 --> 01:04:42.095]  And I just enjoyed saying, oh, that's all you got.
[01:04:42.095 --> 01:04:43.096]  You're a mental midget.
[01:04:44.565 --> 01:04:50.256]  I almost, I didn't really almost get in a fight, I was just like, you know, you're a punk!
[01:04:50.256 --> 01:04:55.265]  How dare you think you can come over here and hempeck me and I'd fall over on the ground and start peeping on myself, I actually said that.
[01:04:55.265 --> 01:04:57.369]  I mean, you people are crazy.
[01:05:00.382 --> 01:05:05.925]  It turns out Hillary Clinton and her top aides aren't the only ones with secret email aliases.
[01:05:05.925 --> 01:05:16.091]  Documents uncovered through the Freedom of Information Act reveal that former Attorney General Eric Holder used a false name for his official Justice Department email account.
[01:05:16.391 --> 01:05:27.074]  According to documents obtained by Vice News, all mentions of Lou Alcindor, the birth name of basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, were actually referring to Holder himself.
[01:05:27.074 --> 01:05:38.338]  In response to the FOIA release, a Justice Department spokesman said that Holder's actions, they're not improper, legally questionable, or used to thwart FOIA requests seeking information on the former Attorney General.
[01:05:38.678 --> 01:05:40.539]  Hmm, where have we heard that before?
[01:05:40.539 --> 01:05:51.563]  Experts in FOIA law say holders' Lou Alcindor identity calls into question the ability of FOIA staff to locate all emails from an official who uses an alias.
[01:05:51.563 --> 01:05:52.344]  Indeed.
[01:05:52.344 --> 01:05:54.044]  You can read more at InfoWars.com.
[01:05:58.388 --> 01:06:01.889]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:06:01.889 --> 01:06:10.130]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:06:10.130 --> 01:06:15.552]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:06:15.552 --> 01:06:18.072]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:06:58.101 --> 01:07:03.844]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[01:07:03.844 --> 01:07:18.290]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[01:07:18.550 --> 01:07:26.555]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[01:07:26.555 --> 01:07:31.978]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[01:07:31.978 --> 01:07:35.680]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:39.823]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[01:07:39.823 --> 01:07:43.685]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[01:07:44.005 --> 01:07:46.927]  As a community moves towards despotism, respect is restricted to fewer people.
[01:08:05.982 --> 01:08:15.209]  That's veteran Denver Police Officer Charles Jones IV smashing an unarmed suspect in the face six times.
[01:08:15.209 --> 01:08:19.532]  Officers accused of using excessive force on a suspect and then trying to erase the evidence.
[01:08:19.532 --> 01:08:24.475]  I'm observing what they're doing and they're all saying to me, I don't understand what's going on.
[01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:33.862]  A community rates low on an information scale when the press, radio, and other channels of communication are controlled by only a few people.
[01:08:34.733 --> 01:08:42.476]  Does it raise ethical questions about the use of government money to produce stories about the government that wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were produced by the government?
[01:08:42.476 --> 01:08:44.077]  How can you ask such a question?
[01:08:44.077 --> 01:08:47.599]  What difference at this point does it make?
[01:08:47.599 --> 01:08:54.081]  When a confident observer looks for signs of despotism in the community, he looks beyond fine words and noble phrases.
[01:08:54.081 --> 01:09:01.705]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.
[01:09:02.862 --> 01:09:05.084]  Tonight, I'm announcing those actions.
[01:09:05.084 --> 01:09:07.265]  When I say go, see?
[01:09:07.265 --> 01:09:11.528]  I'm the law around here!
[01:09:11.528 --> 01:09:14.090]  He came, he saw, he died.
[01:09:16.713 --> 01:09:23.417]  Yes, in modern warfare, our military leaders are finding that words and ideas are highly effective weapons.
[01:09:23.417 --> 01:09:25.239]  You just have to be repetitive about this.
[01:09:25.239 --> 01:09:32.703]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[01:09:32.703 --> 01:09:35.065]  We are trained to deceive if we have to.
[01:09:35.065 --> 01:09:36.586]  You really don't have to trust me.
[01:09:36.586 --> 01:09:37.406]  You shouldn't trust me.
[01:09:37.406 --> 01:09:41.489]  In fact, by my actually participating that, I will taint the news.
[01:09:41.489 --> 01:09:45.472]  In communities of this kind, despotism stands a good chance.
[01:09:45.472 --> 01:09:45.532]  The
[01:09:46.632 --> 01:09:52.975]  Nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[01:09:52.975 --> 01:09:53.495]  Okay, Ms.
[01:09:53.495 --> 01:09:57.897]  Hughes, well, we're gonna do everything we can to help you.
[01:09:57.897 --> 01:10:01.878]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:10:01.878 --> 01:10:04.559]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:10:04.559 --> 01:10:07.060]  Because there is a rule for your mind.
[01:10:09.824 --> 01:10:14.049]  And we are now well into the second hour of the worldwide broadcast.
[01:10:14.049 --> 01:10:16.331]  We have three hours spanning out before us.
[01:10:16.331 --> 01:10:21.336]  For the next two hours, consummate political insider Roger Stone is going to be our guest.
[01:10:21.336 --> 01:10:24.519]  He's also the best-selling author of The Men Who Killed Kennedy.
[01:10:24.519 --> 01:10:26.341]  They got turned into TV shows, you name it.
[01:10:26.341 --> 01:10:31.246]  His two new books are available at InfoWarsTore.com or Amazon.com or TheStoneZone.com.
[01:10:31.246 --> 01:10:32.388]  I don't care where you get them, just get them.
[01:10:33.068 --> 01:10:40.755]  The sellout quick though, I had to wait months to even get them, the Clinton's war on women and now Jeb and the Bush crime family.
[01:10:40.755 --> 01:10:44.738]  Now I want to cover so much today with Roger Stone.
[01:10:44.738 --> 01:10:47.341]  I want to get into the fall of the Bush dynasty.
[01:10:47.341 --> 01:10:54.026]  I want to get into the unprecedented attacks on Trump that the world has never seen before.
[01:10:54.026 --> 01:10:54.607]  Chinese
[01:10:56.248 --> 01:10:58.609]  Murderous government coming out.
[01:10:58.609 --> 01:11:02.551]  We have the Mexican President Vicente Fox, former president coming out.
[01:11:02.551 --> 01:11:12.295]  Democratic parties, Republican parties, Karl Rove, the Bushes, the Clintons, the Pope, Obama saying, you're not allowed to have him, he's disqualified.
[01:11:12.295 --> 01:11:24.360]  The arrogance of these people, I believe will finally be their undoing because even though they know they're losing their viewers, they're a shadow of what they were, and independent media like myself, when I say 28 million viewers a week,
[01:11:25.233 --> 01:11:28.615]  We're talking about 10 million of those listening or watching in the U.S.
[01:11:28.615 --> 01:11:30.497]  That's in the top five radio shows.
[01:11:30.497 --> 01:11:33.819]  And then the other 18 million, we have the Google numbers.
[01:11:33.819 --> 01:11:35.000]  I can show Stone in there.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.501]  All the analytics is global.
[01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:37.121]  We're big.
[01:11:37.121 --> 01:11:37.982]  We're putting out info.
[01:11:37.982 --> 01:11:39.183]  We're about freedom and renaissance.
[01:11:39.183 --> 01:11:43.686]  We're not even, you know, just about domestic audiences here, though I'm an American.
[01:11:43.686 --> 01:11:48.229]  This is a fight for freedom worldwide that Ron Paul and others have talked about for true
[01:11:50.273 --> 01:11:53.214]  Free market capitalism, not this crony garbage we've got.
[01:11:53.214 --> 01:11:59.597]  And Mr. Stone, in the last few decades, has had the will to write best-selling books exposing this shadow government.
[01:11:59.597 --> 01:12:12.623]  And he's somebody that should know, because he's worked inside, deeply, three administrations, been in four administrations, and has been around since Barry Goldwater, worked inside the White House with Nixon, right through with Reagan, helped George Herbert Walker Bush get elected.
[01:12:13.123 --> 01:12:19.909]  But since then has basically realized, and I'm just recapping what you've said before, that you couldn't do as much inside anymore.
[01:12:19.909 --> 01:12:21.250]  You could do more without.
[01:12:21.250 --> 01:12:26.694]  Just like you were the head of Trump's campaign, you got out so that you could actually do more making your own decisions.
[01:12:26.694 --> 01:12:34.021]  And I see you everywhere like a superhero, really defending Trump's flank when they try to sneak in and take him out.
[01:12:34.021 --> 01:12:35.602]  So I want to get into that.
[01:12:35.602 --> 01:12:40.967]  The fall of the Bushes, the unprecedented attacks, the fact that you have been banned and that they would say it.
[01:12:41.772 --> 01:12:47.117]  We have banned Roger Stone from CNN because he made fun of some of our ignorant reporters.
[01:12:47.117 --> 01:12:50.100]  This is amazing, and it's why they're dying, but they don't care.
[01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:53.043]  They want to set that president to shut down free speech.
[01:12:53.043 --> 01:12:59.210]  And everywhere, they're arresting Le Pen of the Nationalist Front, which is his mainline conservative, in France.
[01:13:00.090 --> 01:13:03.051]  For saying there's a Muslim invasion, it's dangerous?
[01:13:03.051 --> 01:13:06.271]  It is incredible, the censorship of the universities.
[01:13:06.271 --> 01:13:09.632]  Harvard just came out today and said we will no longer say master's degree.
[01:13:09.632 --> 01:13:10.812]  Because, I mean, master's?
[01:13:10.812 --> 01:13:11.673]  Master's at golf?
[01:13:11.673 --> 01:13:13.713]  Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi's a master?
[01:13:13.713 --> 01:13:14.413]  No, no.
[01:13:14.413 --> 01:13:15.273]  Slave master.
[01:13:15.273 --> 01:13:16.774]  Banning the word lynch.
[01:13:16.774 --> 01:13:18.334]  The last name is now evil.
[01:13:18.334 --> 01:13:25.395]  This is a cult of mind control, in my view, and I want to just run the gamut of why they're so scared of Donald Trump.
[01:13:25.395 --> 01:13:26.816]  Killing political correctness.
[01:13:26.816 --> 01:13:28.016]  I mean, blowing a hole through it.
[01:13:28.676 --> 01:13:32.499]  Calling the Emperor's new clothes and then I get concerned and let's start here first.
[01:13:32.499 --> 01:13:46.149]  I'm gonna try to shut up I'm so excited with the fact that Think about this the New York Times clearly gave the green light for their columnists to come out and say we need to kill Donald Trump and We see many others saying we need to shut him down.
[01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:50.352]  We need to arrest him the IRS needs to come after him Everything you predicted.
[01:13:50.352 --> 01:13:52.894]  I mean if everybody doesn't get behind Trump
[01:13:54.554 --> 01:13:56.436]  They're clearly siding with the establishment.
[01:13:56.436 --> 01:13:59.319]  There's never been a clear-cut example.
[01:13:59.319 --> 01:14:06.526]  Roger Stone, and I'm just so glad in the last six months that I began to get behind Trump's reading the tea leaves and realizing, no, this guy's got to be for real.
[01:14:06.526 --> 01:14:08.368]  9-11 truth.
[01:14:08.368 --> 01:14:09.650]  Wanting to audit the Federal Reserve.
[01:14:09.650 --> 01:14:11.952]  I mean, it is just incredible what he's doing.
[01:14:11.952 --> 01:14:12.793]  Great to have you here.
[01:14:12.793 --> 01:14:14.415]  Delighted to be here, Alex, as always.
[01:14:14.975 --> 01:14:19.016]  I know I'm ranting, it's just so exciting, but my excitement is a mirror of the audience out there.
[01:14:19.016 --> 01:14:21.037]  I mean, they're like 95% behind Trump now.
[01:14:21.037 --> 01:14:24.978]  Folks in my office that weren't for Trump are now saying, no, it's clear we've got to get behind Trump.
[01:14:24.978 --> 01:14:26.358]  What do you think's happening?
[01:14:26.358 --> 01:14:29.539]  Of all the cornucopia I threw out, where should we start first?
[01:14:29.539 --> 01:14:35.941]  Well, this is why the establishment, the insiders, the DC, Wall Street cabal are so upset.
[01:14:35.941 --> 01:14:36.821]  The rise of Trump
[01:14:37.521 --> 01:14:41.602]  is a repudiation of 40 years of bipartisan treason.
[01:14:41.602 --> 01:15:00.849]  It is a complete repudiation of the fiscal policies that have left this country broke, the immigration policies that have taken away our security, the foreign interventionist policies that have made us spend blood and treasure for nothing, the trade policies that put us at a giant disadvantage to China, to Japan, to Mexico,
[01:15:01.369 --> 01:15:09.535]  Trump is naming names and he understands the Clintons and the Bushes, the Republicans and the Democrats are in it together.
[01:15:09.535 --> 01:15:19.782]  And he scares the daylights out of the establishment because normally, as sadly was the case with Reagan, when an outsider is elected president they're immediately co-opted.
[01:15:20.242 --> 01:15:25.005]  What happens is the establishment comes around and says, Oh, Mr. President, you don't know how things work.
[01:15:25.005 --> 01:15:26.967]  We know how things work here in Washington.
[01:15:26.967 --> 01:15:28.307]  Let us help you.
[01:15:28.307 --> 01:15:31.950]  When they help you, they try to undo all of your policies.
[01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:33.691]  Trump cannot be bought.
[01:15:33.691 --> 01:15:35.492]  He cannot be bullied.
[01:15:35.492 --> 01:15:37.173]  He cannot be influenced.
[01:15:37.173 --> 01:15:38.935]  He cannot be squeezed.
[01:15:38.935 --> 01:15:40.616]  He cannot be blackmailed.
[01:15:40.616 --> 01:15:48.661]  And that is why the political establishment is literally wetting their britches over the radical reform that Trump would bring.
[01:15:48.661 --> 01:15:49.762]  He's going to reexamine 9-11.
[01:15:50.622 --> 01:15:54.924]  He's going to re-examine the origins of the phony Iraq War.
[01:15:54.924 --> 01:15:57.785]  He's going to re-examine our Federal Reserve.
[01:15:57.785 --> 01:15:59.406]  He's going to demand an audit.
[01:15:59.406 --> 01:16:00.526]  Who knows bankers better than I do?
[01:16:00.526 --> 01:16:06.648]  Because he understands this political elite is going to come after him regardless, even if he was a sociopath, which I don't think he is.
[01:16:06.648 --> 01:16:08.069]  He's a guy who really cares about America.
[01:16:08.069 --> 01:16:10.650]  He knows they're going to keep coming after him once he gets in.
[01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:13.671]  He's got the will to politically kill them once he's president.
[01:16:13.891 --> 01:16:16.332]  He's a man of enormous personal courage.
[01:16:16.332 --> 01:16:18.793]  I think that his life is in danger.
[01:16:18.793 --> 01:16:25.535]  He is such a threat to the status quo, to the ruling elite, to the established order.
[01:16:25.535 --> 01:16:27.256]  There's no way to stop Trump-NATO.
[01:16:27.256 --> 01:16:30.837]  Now, I can tell you, in every one of these primary states,
[01:16:32.238 --> 01:16:38.983]  The infrastructure controlled by his opponents was greater, yet he's running up giant numbers.
[01:16:38.983 --> 01:16:47.250]  Democrats, independents, African-Americans, people who've stopped voting, people who never voted are coming to the aid of their country.
[01:16:47.250 --> 01:16:49.772]  He's running up numbers like I've never seen.
[01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:57.959]  So he is so much better than his campaign in the sense that this is a spontaneous grassroots uprising.
[01:16:58.519 --> 01:17:01.542]  Donald Trump shows up and thousands show up to greet him.
[01:17:01.542 --> 01:17:03.424]  And here's the big question everybody asks.
[01:17:03.424 --> 01:17:05.927]  Once he gets in, I know he's a smart guy and I can tell he doesn't.
[01:17:05.927 --> 01:17:06.828]  He likes prosperity.
[01:17:06.828 --> 01:17:09.851]  He's not one of these kleptocrats that wants to make people poor to control them.
[01:17:09.851 --> 01:17:12.054]  That's what this austerity globalism is all about.
[01:17:12.054 --> 01:17:12.795]  He clearly is against that.
[01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:13.435]  That's why they hate him.
[01:17:13.435 --> 01:17:14.016]  They're so scared of him.
[01:17:14.016 --> 01:17:14.717]  He's a nationalist.
[01:17:15.996 --> 01:17:26.282]  But if he doesn't deliver on a lot of this, obviously he knows people are going to be so hurt that he will get politically destroyed.
[01:17:26.282 --> 01:17:29.164]  But he's not running because he needs to be president.
[01:17:29.164 --> 01:17:33.827]  He's not running because he wants to burnish his ego or his reputation.
[01:17:33.827 --> 01:17:35.308]  He's climbed every mountain you can climb.
[01:17:35.308 --> 01:17:36.168]  No, no, I understand that.
[01:17:36.168 --> 01:17:39.931]  But I mean, you know him so well, talk to him every day, known him for 40 years.
[01:17:39.931 --> 01:17:45.554]  I mean, tell us who Donald Trump really is at his essence and what you think he'll do once he's president.
[01:17:45.714 --> 01:17:47.035]  He's a fighter.
[01:17:47.035 --> 01:17:49.936]  He is a man of enormous courage.
[01:17:49.936 --> 01:17:51.337]  He's a patriot.
[01:17:51.337 --> 01:17:52.777]  He's a nationalist.
[01:17:52.777 --> 01:17:55.979]  He's a firm believer in American sovereignty.
[01:17:55.979 --> 01:17:56.759]  And why is he running?
[01:17:56.759 --> 01:17:57.600]  I can sum this up.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:00.061]  He's tired of seeing the country go down the drain.
[01:18:00.061 --> 01:18:05.523]  And when he says to us, our leaders are stupid, their decisions are stupid, their decisions make no sense.
[01:18:05.523 --> 01:18:06.304]  You want to give $150 billion?
[01:18:08.945 --> 01:18:10.687]  To Iran and frozen assets?
[01:18:10.687 --> 01:18:12.528]  That's a stupid decision.
[01:18:12.528 --> 01:18:16.792]  Nobody could make a decision like that who cares about the future of their country.
[01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:20.175]  So Trump is giving up, Alex, an incredible lifestyle.
[01:18:20.175 --> 01:18:21.316]  He's got a great family.
[01:18:21.316 --> 01:18:22.658]  He's making himself a major target.
[01:18:22.658 --> 01:18:23.759]  There's no question.
[01:18:23.759 --> 01:18:25.640]  And he's working very hard.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.683]  I dare say it's been a long time since he's seen a golf course.
[01:18:28.683 --> 01:18:32.507]  This guy loves to play golf as a form of relaxation, as a form of focus.
[01:18:33.167 --> 01:18:42.597]  But he's working harder than those who know him ever believed he would work, because he sees the future of America in the balance, and he understands this is it.
[01:18:42.597 --> 01:18:44.018]  This is the moment.
[01:18:44.018 --> 01:18:51.245]  We either save our country, take it back, and restore its greatness, or we step into a thousand years of darkness.
[01:18:51.245 --> 01:18:52.967]  Roger Stone is our guest.
[01:18:52.967 --> 01:18:53.848]  We're going to skip this.
[01:18:53.848 --> 01:18:54.729]  This is so important.
[01:18:56.334 --> 01:19:02.953]  Looking at this, I've studied history, I've been involved in politics for 25 years, first working for Buchanan when I was in high school.
[01:19:04.013 --> 01:19:05.334]  I'm not a political insider, though.
[01:19:05.334 --> 01:19:18.008]  I'm just a person from the grassroots that got involved with AXS TV, then radio, then syndicated radio, because I really didn't want to be a slave, and I could see multinationals coming in to killing the Bill of Rights, killing the Constitution, and turning myself and my family into slaves.
[01:19:18.008 --> 01:19:20.731]  I mean, it really comes down to that, that I'm territorial.
[01:19:20.731 --> 01:19:25.876]  I'm not going to have a bunch of special interests come in and root me out and dominate me, and that's what Trump said.
[01:19:26.537 --> 01:19:27.658]  Is he standing up?
[01:19:41.644 --> 01:19:42.224]  He said this.
[01:19:42.224 --> 01:19:45.246]  He realizes he'll be pretty much, his name's going to be heard.
[01:19:45.246 --> 01:19:48.007]  He'll pretty much have to retire if he doesn't win this.
[01:19:48.007 --> 01:19:52.449]  And to see him not bought, not controlled, it's like the return of a man.
[01:19:52.449 --> 01:19:58.352]  Because not since Reagan have we had somebody that wasn't totally controlled by this political class.
[01:19:58.352 --> 01:20:01.393]  They hate Trump because he's not paying money for all the ads.
[01:20:01.393 --> 01:20:02.874]  He's not hiring all the consultants.
[01:20:03.274 --> 01:20:07.900]  This guy, as Chris Christie just said an hour ago endorsing him, has rewritten the political playbook.
[01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:08.841]  It's seismic.
[01:20:08.841 --> 01:20:13.067]  I mean, I get goosebumps because, and I rarely do, because this is so epic.
[01:20:13.067 --> 01:20:14.969]  I don't think viewers and listeners understand.
[01:20:14.969 --> 01:20:19.535]  There's no doubt now, whether Trump was for real or not, and I know he's for real in my gut, and I can see it politically.
[01:20:20.356 --> 01:20:34.383]  He's breaking all the taboos, he is wrecking the insiders, he is changing the system forever, and it's just a manifestation, as you said, of a larger political uprising of populism, and Fox News is the worst now.
[01:20:34.383 --> 01:20:37.025]  I know you go on Megyn Kelly and there's some nice folks over there, but...
[01:20:37.825 --> 01:20:39.867]  Fox News has this talking point.
[01:20:39.867 --> 01:20:43.111]  Oh, I know, it's just poor white people and racist whites.
[01:20:43.111 --> 01:20:53.382]  I mean, it's like MSNBC now, and they're just putting it out that, you know, Trump's really a Democrat and, oh, it's racist and all this, because it's whites that feel like they're getting poor, when his campaign isn't about race.
[01:20:53.382 --> 01:20:55.024]  It is so sick.
[01:20:55.024 --> 01:20:56.426]  Do you think that that tactic will fail?
[01:20:57.332 --> 01:21:02.094]  Well, frankly, there are far more egregious offenders than Fox.
[01:21:02.094 --> 01:21:08.257]  I've got to say a word in defense of Fox, because Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity... Oh, Sean Hannity's good on that.
[01:21:08.257 --> 01:21:20.042]  These guys have given Trump his fair shake, and his point of view is at least reflective... Even though there's orders coming down probably from Murdoch to... Well, compare that to CNN, which is the Clinton News Network.
[01:21:20.042 --> 01:21:23.884]  All I'm saying is, shouldn't Fox be more supportive of a populist conservative?
[01:21:24.524 --> 01:21:26.385]  I think they are supportive of him.
[01:21:26.385 --> 01:21:32.489]  I do think he gets access and he gets his chance to lay out his case to the American people.
[01:21:32.489 --> 01:21:35.670]  So I am not a critic of Fox, but I'll say this.
[01:21:35.670 --> 01:21:37.211]  I am a critic of CNN.
[01:21:37.211 --> 01:21:38.332]  Now it's very interesting.
[01:21:38.332 --> 01:21:39.673]  Alex, I went back and had to look.
[01:21:40.433 --> 01:21:52.317]  Since August of last year, I've either been on Fox Business or the Fox News Channel to talk on behalf of Trump, to defend Trump, to stand up for Trump 49 times.
[01:21:52.317 --> 01:21:56.839]  I have been on CNN exactly three times since August.
[01:21:57.919 --> 01:21:58.259]  That's a
[01:22:15.606 --> 01:22:19.749]  First they demand I be banned at CNN, where I was never admitted.
[01:22:19.749 --> 01:22:25.632]  Now MSNBC, where I have not appeared once this year, and appeared once last year.
[01:22:25.632 --> 01:22:26.413]  They've banned me!
[01:22:26.413 --> 01:22:29.795]  How do you ban someone who's never been admitted to the N-Wave?
[01:22:29.795 --> 01:22:31.216]  So why are they announcing it?
[01:22:31.216 --> 01:22:33.277]  Just to set the precedent for banning people?
[01:22:33.277 --> 01:22:35.879]  Well, because they know I have the goods on the bushes in the Clintons.
[01:22:36.039 --> 01:22:47.122]  Because they know, as someone who was an insider for 40 years, as someone who was in the service of three American presidents, who worked on nine Republican presidential campaigns, as someone who worked in the U.S.
[01:22:47.122 --> 01:22:51.683]  Senate as an assistant to Senator Bob Dole, a patriot, as someone who worked in the U.S.
[01:22:51.683 --> 01:22:59.325]  House as an assistant to Congressman Bob Steele, who was a member of the House Budget Committee, they know that I've seen the inside workings of the establishment.
[01:22:59.705 --> 01:23:02.068]  They know I have the goods on Hillary Clinton.
[01:23:02.068 --> 01:23:14.162]  They know that I'm well aware of the fact that her husband is a sexual predator who has attacked multiple women, but more importantly, that Hillary has been an accessory after the fact in every one of those sex crimes.
[01:23:14.862 --> 01:23:25.205]  They know that I'm well aware of Bill's abandoned, mixed-race son, Danny Williams, who they threw away like a piece of trash, and who they doctored up a phony DNA test.
[01:23:25.205 --> 01:23:31.446]  They know that I have the keys to defeating the Clintons, and therefore Stone must be discredited.
[01:23:31.446 --> 01:23:34.347]  We must discredit him because he knows too much.
[01:23:35.558 --> 01:23:38.380]  Well, Nelson, your point, you're right about Fox.
[01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:49.668]  I would just expect them, I mean obviously they're not as bad as CNN or MSNBC, I would just expect them with a patriot like this, a clear winner, not to do the little jabs and stuff.
[01:23:49.668 --> 01:23:51.169]  So that's why I'm upset with Fox.
[01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:52.890]  At least they're a real news network.
[01:23:52.890 --> 01:23:56.432]  When they say fair and balanced, they are fair and balanced.
[01:23:56.432 --> 01:23:58.813]  So I get it, that's why they have some focus back on Trump.
[01:23:58.813 --> 01:24:04.236]  Many of the talking heads there, who I know privately, personally, very pro-Trump, and not afraid to say so.
[01:24:04.236 --> 01:24:07.678]  And they let Trump and the Trump campaign get its fair share of coverage.
[01:24:07.678 --> 01:24:08.858]  Well, let's talk numbers then.
[01:24:08.858 --> 01:24:11.280]  Super Tuesday.
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:12.280]  What do you expect to happen?
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:15.982]  What's a big win versus something that isn't as good a win?
[01:24:15.982 --> 01:24:17.123]  What do you really think is about to happen?
[01:24:17.843 --> 01:24:23.465]  I still think Trump is on track to win big because this is a natural phenomena.
[01:24:23.465 --> 01:24:25.725]  It's not about paid television commercials.
[01:24:25.725 --> 01:24:27.386]  It's not about phone banks.
[01:24:27.386 --> 01:24:31.187]  It's not about the party organization and who's endorsed by who.
[01:24:31.187 --> 01:24:33.948]  This is a citizen uprising.
[01:24:33.948 --> 01:24:36.108]  And all the polls have been wrong.
[01:24:36.108 --> 01:24:38.669]  Donald Trump has always outperformed the polls.
[01:24:38.669 --> 01:24:42.590]  He actually runs ahead of where the polls say they're going to run.
[01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:45.091]  So here's the bad news for the Republican establishment.
[01:24:45.091 --> 01:24:45.991]  They have always assumed.
[01:24:46.411 --> 01:25:02.847]  That as this field winnowed down, as the Chris Christie's got out of the race, as Jeb Bush got out of the race, as the race boiled down to two candidates or three candidates, that all the establishment voters would galvanize behind the establishment candidate and Trump could be defeated.
[01:25:02.847 --> 01:25:04.469]  Here's what they didn't count on.
[01:25:04.469 --> 01:25:09.033]  Trump is bringing in thousands of new people, young people, disaffected people.
[01:25:09.113 --> 01:25:11.014]  It's populism, that's what they're scared of.
[01:25:11.014 --> 01:25:13.416]  It's Andrew Jackson style populism.
[01:25:13.416 --> 01:25:16.698]  And ironically, the establishment never liked Jackson.
[01:25:16.698 --> 01:25:17.399]  You know why?
[01:25:17.399 --> 01:25:18.800]  He was so crude.
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:20.061]  He was so blunt.
[01:25:20.061 --> 01:25:21.742]  He was so plain spoken.
[01:25:21.742 --> 01:25:23.303]  He was so uncultured.
[01:25:23.303 --> 01:25:26.125]  He was a truth teller of his time.
[01:25:26.125 --> 01:25:28.627]  And he denounced the big banks.
[01:25:28.627 --> 01:25:31.349]  He denounced federal control by the big banks.
[01:25:31.349 --> 01:25:32.750]  Does this sound familiar?
[01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:35.772]  Donald Trump may be the greatest American hero since Andrew Jackson.
[01:25:36.412 --> 01:25:46.583]  I was about to say, if he gets elected and actually delivers on 20% of what he says he'll do, because obviously he can't do everything, he's not a dictator, he'll be as big as George Washington.
[01:25:46.583 --> 01:25:58.076]  I think Trump realizes that, but you know him well, that if he can be the guy that's the turnaround expert for America and the brand Americana, that he'll be who John Wayne wishes he was.
[01:25:58.416 --> 01:26:01.040]  And I only think, in all honesty, that it'll take one term.
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:05.367]  He only wants one term because he's going to bring such broad change to the country.
[01:26:05.367 --> 01:26:06.649]  Let's take the wall.
[01:26:06.649 --> 01:26:13.019]  Donald Trump knows, from an engineering point of view, from a construction point of view, that the wall can be built.
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:16.222]  The Mexicans say they're not going to pay for it?
[01:26:16.222 --> 01:26:23.509]  Donald Trump's well aware of the fact that the Mexican government is laundering millions of dollars in drug money.
[01:26:23.509 --> 01:26:24.850]  They are the central bank.
[01:26:24.850 --> 01:26:25.571]  Billions.
[01:26:25.571 --> 01:26:28.154]  They are the central bankers for the cartels.
[01:26:28.154 --> 01:26:30.476]  So we'll be indicting Mexican
[01:26:32.138 --> 01:26:45.556]  Yeah, we'll have a war because we're going to make them obey the law and Donald Trump will make the Mexicans stop importing billions of dollars into our country in drugs that are destroying our inner cities, that are killing our young people.
[01:26:46.357 --> 01:26:50.280]  Well, there's a lot of other pressure also that can be done because there's so many subsidies.
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:54.163]  Billions a year sit down there just to, quote, fight the drug war.
[01:26:54.163 --> 01:26:56.385]  So, I mean, there's so much leverage.
[01:26:56.385 --> 01:26:59.187]  Mexico is basically totally dependent on the U.S.
[01:26:59.187 --> 01:27:01.649]  And so if people say it's crazy, he's going to make them pay for a wall.
[01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:16.278]  I mean, Trump, I believe, will actually try to get that done, but what I like is him coming out and saying, on at the Fed, you were on a few days before he came out with those tweets, and was that just spontaneous that he did that, or had you been talking to him?
[01:27:16.278 --> 01:27:18.820]  Who understands bankers better than Donald Trump?
[01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:20.881]  Donald Trump understands the banker mentality.
[01:27:20.881 --> 01:27:24.223]  He's taken more bankers to the cleaner than any businessman in the country.
[01:27:24.223 --> 01:27:28.045]  He understands how they operate, and he wants to know what's happening at the Fed.
[01:27:28.045 --> 01:27:31.747]  He wants to understand the Fed's role in our economy.
[01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:33.809]  I worked in the Senate.
[01:27:33.809 --> 01:27:34.729]  I worked in the House.
[01:27:34.729 --> 01:27:36.830]  I worked on the budgeting process.
[01:27:36.830 --> 01:27:42.993]  There's billions of dollars of fraud and waste in our, in our, in our federal budget.
[01:27:42.993 --> 01:27:57.980]  But the reason that everybody in the political class always talks about cutting it, but never really cuts it, is because every one of those dollars has been put there by somebody, somebody powerful, some senator, some congressman, some special... And that's why they're scared to death?
[01:27:57.980 --> 01:27:59.061]  Is he might actually cut that off?
[01:27:59.141 --> 01:28:01.023]  He is going to take an axe to federal spending.
[01:28:01.023 --> 01:28:03.325]  Look at the way he runs his own companies.
[01:28:03.325 --> 01:28:05.187]  He runs a very tight ship.
[01:28:05.187 --> 01:28:06.228]  He wastes not a dollar.
[01:28:06.228 --> 01:28:14.296]  And folks shouldn't be scared because then all that money will just stay with taxpayers and go where you want it, going to innovation, going to choices you've made, going to competition.
[01:28:14.296 --> 01:28:14.897]  It'll explode.
[01:28:15.237 --> 01:28:18.638]  Not a dollar that we're talking about is helping the American people in any way.
[01:28:18.638 --> 01:28:20.658]  It's only helping special interests.
[01:28:20.658 --> 01:28:30.900]  So now, finally, you would have a president with the guts and the fortitude and the knowledge and the green eye shade to really cut federal spending.
[01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:39.302]  Which, as you know, between that and Trump's incredibly dynamic tax reform plan, you would have a booming economy.
[01:28:39.562 --> 01:28:52.595]  Well, look, they're genuinely afraid of him because he's a nationalist, because he's a family guy, he's anti-political correctness, he's sick of being bullied, he's sick of America being bullied, that he doesn't want to start just mindless, pointless wars for profit.
[01:28:52.595 --> 01:28:54.097]  He's just good on every point.
[01:28:54.097 --> 01:28:58.401]  I mean, it's really amazing to have somebody this good, and that's why they're so scared.
[01:28:58.401 --> 01:29:01.344]  When we come back, Mr. Stone, I want to go through
[01:29:03.194 --> 01:29:03.715]  Strategies
[01:29:24.958 --> 01:29:29.299]  And so if they think they're going to bring out his taxes and demonize him over something, I think that's going to backfire.
[01:29:29.299 --> 01:29:31.840]  It seems like their instincts are really turning against him.
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:34.880]  And then the fall of the House of Bush.
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:36.261]  Have we now seen it?
[01:29:36.261 --> 01:29:39.541]  And was it Donald Trump bringing up the 28 pages that did it?
[01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:40.862]  Because obviously it is, folks.
[01:29:40.862 --> 01:29:45.383]  And again, that's another reason to just say I'm all in for Donald J. Trump.
[01:29:45.383 --> 01:29:47.643]  Stay with us.
[01:29:47.643 --> 01:29:49.024]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.024 --> 01:29:51.564]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.564 --> 01:29:54.225]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.867 --> 01:30:06.612]  Someone on Twitter asks, Hey, if you're so against the left-right paradigm, then why do you only talk about the Republican candidates and not Bernie Sanders?
[01:30:06.612 --> 01:30:10.274]  Listen, the Sanders tax plan will destroy the middle class.
[01:30:10.274 --> 01:30:13.456]  You've got to loot the middle class because that's where the money is.
[01:30:13.456 --> 01:30:20.201]  According to the Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation, the Sanders tax plan will raise taxes on most Americans.
[01:30:20.401 --> 01:30:25.083]  It's a very big tax increase for everyone except those at the bottom.
[01:30:25.083 --> 01:30:32.967]  Everybody loves to get free stuff and politicians are always pitching the idea that the poor and middle class are going to get the benefits and the rich will pay for it.
[01:30:32.967 --> 01:30:37.650]  Americans received more than two trillion dollars in benefits from the federal government in 2014.
[01:30:37.650 --> 01:30:41.391]  Bernie wants to hike that amount exponentially.
[01:30:41.391 --> 01:30:48.295]  The question is, where's the money going to come from after the middle class and the millionaires have been looted and the mega-rich flee the country?
[01:30:48.735 --> 01:30:54.204]  To find out in detail how the Sanders tax plan will destroy the middle class, visit InfoWars.com.
[01:30:59.895 --> 01:31:03.658]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:31:03.658 --> 01:31:11.403]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:31:11.403 --> 01:31:20.029]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:31:20.029 --> 01:31:24.431]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:31:24.431 --> 01:31:29.595]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:31:29.735 --> 01:31:30.575]  We're good to go.
[01:31:58.268 --> 01:32:02.931]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male, and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[01:32:02.931 --> 01:32:07.694]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:32:07.694 --> 01:32:09.014]  Talk about the effects.
[01:32:09.014 --> 01:32:10.535]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:32:10.535 --> 01:32:12.456]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:32:12.456 --> 01:32:13.577]  I feel like I look better.
[01:32:13.577 --> 01:32:14.277]  I feel better.
[01:32:14.277 --> 01:32:15.338]  I feel sexier.
[01:32:15.338 --> 01:32:16.319]  I love it.
[01:32:16.319 --> 01:32:19.300]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.

[01:33:19.228 --> 01:33:28.614]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:28.614 --> 01:33:30.015]  I'm running for president.
[01:33:30.015 --> 01:33:33.197]  Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.
[01:33:33.197 --> 01:33:37.620]  I don't feel no ways tired.
[01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:38.921]  I've come too far!
[01:33:38.921 --> 01:33:41.322]  I ain't no ways tired!
[01:33:41.322 --> 01:33:42.603]  Me own animal!
[01:33:42.603 --> 01:33:43.964]  What was that?
[01:33:43.964 --> 01:33:45.125]  Is that a dog?
[01:33:47.971 --> 01:33:50.552]  Uh-uh.
[01:33:50.552 --> 01:33:54.173]  It has been reported you've made five million making speeches.
[01:33:54.173 --> 01:33:57.595]  The president made more than a hundred million dollars.
[01:33:57.595 --> 01:34:00.135]  What difference at this point does it make?
[01:34:00.135 --> 01:34:02.776]  What does that make Hillary Clinton to the Bush family?
[01:34:02.776 --> 01:34:04.017]  It's my sister-in-law.
[01:34:11.325 --> 01:34:13.146]  Hillary's a liar!
[01:34:13.146 --> 01:34:15.446]  Another conspiracy theory.
[01:34:15.446 --> 01:34:17.307]  Have you always told the truth?
[01:34:17.307 --> 01:34:18.847]  I've always tried to.
[01:34:18.847 --> 01:34:19.768]  Always.
[01:34:19.768 --> 01:34:20.588]  Always.
[01:34:20.588 --> 01:34:23.929]  I will fight to reign in Wall Street, and you know what?
[01:34:23.929 --> 01:34:26.670]  I know how to do it!
[01:34:26.670 --> 01:34:29.671]  He came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt.
[01:34:29.671 --> 01:34:32.452]  I remember landing under sniper fire.
[01:34:32.452 --> 01:34:39.154]  There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles.
[01:34:44.815 --> 01:34:46.817]  I'm just a little sick.
[01:34:46.817 --> 01:34:47.097]  Open up.
[01:34:47.097 --> 01:34:51.401]  Come on, take it.
[01:34:51.401 --> 01:34:55.304]  Take it.
[01:34:55.304 --> 01:35:04.212]  I swear to God, he's a very good joker.
[01:35:10.169 --> 01:35:12.251]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:35:12.251 --> 01:35:16.194]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:35:16.194 --> 01:35:18.476]  I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.
[01:35:18.476 --> 01:35:21.398]  Alright, Mr. Stone is going to be with us all the way to the end of the next hour.
[01:35:21.398 --> 01:35:29.325]  And next hour I'm going to open the phones up for first-time callers that have a specific question for Mr. Stone.
[01:35:29.325 --> 01:35:31.287]  Huge Trump insider, former head of his campaign.
[01:35:32.737 --> 01:35:36.781]  And also if you disagree with Trump, you're welcome to call in as well.
[01:35:36.781 --> 01:35:39.304]  So I'm going to go ahead and give the number out now.
[01:35:39.304 --> 01:35:41.045]  It'll be about 30 minutes till we go to your calls.
[01:35:41.045 --> 01:35:41.106]  800-259-9231.
[01:35:41.106 --> 01:35:41.326]  800-259-9231.
[01:35:41.326 --> 01:35:43.788]  Now I've been kind of ranting and asking my questions.
[01:35:43.788 --> 01:35:45.690]  He's got a bunch of points he wants to get
[01:35:50.755 --> 01:35:55.179]  The real plan is to steal the election from Trump, but Sunshine can stop it.
[01:35:55.179 --> 01:35:57.501]  Then the fall of the House of Bush.
[01:35:57.501 --> 01:36:06.488]  That's kind of old news now, but I want to do a post-mortem on it because it shows where the whole power structure is going if they don't get smart and stop cannibalizing the Golden Goose.
[01:36:06.488 --> 01:36:07.829]  That's all coming up.
[01:36:07.829 --> 01:36:10.671]  His two books are available at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:36:10.671 --> 01:36:14.674]  The Clinton's War on Women and Jeb and the Bush Crime Family.
[01:36:14.674 --> 01:36:15.275]  And this is the guy
[01:36:16.015 --> 01:36:18.717]  To a great extent, advising Donald Trump.
[01:36:18.717 --> 01:36:22.720]  And so that obviously is another reason the power structure is so scared.
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:32.027]  And you noticed whenever Stone was in here four or five months ago, he said, watch, Trump is going to go after the Bush crime families and go after Clinton for the raping and her covering it up.
[01:36:32.027 --> 01:36:33.568]  And he did it all.
[01:36:33.568 --> 01:36:37.211]  So we literally are talking to the Trump insider here right now.
[01:36:37.211 --> 01:36:38.272]  It's so exciting.
[01:36:38.272 --> 01:36:40.574]  The establishment media is tearing their hair out about this.
[01:36:40.574 --> 01:36:41.834]  He's going to be speaking tomorrow night.
[01:36:41.834 --> 01:36:43.436]  I will have a camera crew there covering it.
[01:36:43.956 --> 01:36:48.018]  I don't want to say I'm going to show up and get in the way, but I might pop in towards the end.
[01:36:48.018 --> 01:36:53.501]  At Brave New Books in downtown Austin, down by UT at Guadalupe.
[01:36:53.501 --> 01:36:54.881]  I'm going to try to get him to speak at UT.
[01:36:54.881 --> 01:36:57.402]  I spoke there and they filled the whole hall, 2,000 people.
[01:36:57.402 --> 01:37:02.125]  But believe me, you'll want to get there early, because about 100 people can get into the downstairs area, about 100 upstairs.
[01:37:02.125 --> 01:37:06.467]  So you'll get to meet him regardless, and they'll have lines around the building, believe me.
[01:37:06.467 --> 01:37:08.408]  But that is 7 o'clock tomorrow.
[01:37:09.463 --> 01:37:18.654]  On Saturday, break new books and we're going to shoot his speech and then there are excerpts of it because everything he says is so good on the Sunday show that I'll be hosting 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:37:18.654 --> 01:37:19.736]  Central Standard Time.
[01:37:19.736 --> 01:37:27.705]  But I'm definitely going to send a crew down there and do a Facebook mentions during his speech that'll get millions of views and I'm going to do a periscope down there
[01:37:28.286 --> 01:37:30.688]  The issue is, as Facebook mentioned, it's supposed to be personal.
[01:37:30.688 --> 01:37:33.992]  That's why I may be in the parking lot and start the video and then send it in and not go in.
[01:37:33.992 --> 01:37:36.714]  I mean, I want to be there, but again, it turns into a circus.
[01:37:36.714 --> 01:37:38.036]  So that's tomorrow night.
[01:37:38.036 --> 01:37:41.899]  Brave New Books, downtown Austin, Texas.
[01:37:41.899 --> 01:37:43.241]  Be sure and be there.
[01:37:43.241 --> 01:37:44.302]  And then we'll talk to folks.
[01:37:44.882 --> 01:37:49.903]  Obviously live on Facebook mentions and more who want to make their comments as well.
[01:37:49.903 --> 01:37:51.844]  We're going to go for a few hours tomorrow night.
[01:37:51.844 --> 01:37:53.604]  This is a really important event.
[01:37:53.604 --> 01:37:57.085]  I'm told a lot of newspapers and TV are going to be there covering as well.
[01:37:57.085 --> 01:37:58.445]  So that's fantastic.
[01:37:58.445 --> 01:38:00.765]  Will Stone himself defeat the globalists?
[01:38:00.765 --> 01:38:04.786]  No, but all of us together backing him and Donald Trump and others, we will.
[01:38:04.786 --> 01:38:06.227]  It's the power of the populace.
[01:38:06.227 --> 01:38:07.287]  Speaking of the power of the populace,
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:17.961]  This organization, back when the IRS was auditing me and I was getting harassed and death threats ensued, and they said, look, this is about eight years ago, I was told by the establishment, shut up, leave us alone.
[01:38:19.164 --> 01:38:20.845]  And we got syndication deals for you and stuff.
[01:38:20.845 --> 01:38:22.327]  Just be a mainline Republican.
[01:38:22.327 --> 01:38:23.047]  And I said, you know what?
[01:38:23.047 --> 01:38:24.548]  I'm gonna actually try to make money now.
[01:38:24.548 --> 01:38:25.589]  I'm gonna try to get big now.
[01:38:25.589 --> 01:38:30.333]  I'm gonna really try to expand now and hire reporters because you tried to shut me up.
[01:38:30.333 --> 01:38:31.854]  I was gonna stay small before.
[01:38:31.854 --> 01:38:33.296]  You tried to push me around.
[01:38:33.296 --> 01:38:33.996]  Watch what happens.
[01:38:33.996 --> 01:38:37.359]  And now, we don't reach 4 or 5 million people a week.
[01:38:37.359 --> 01:38:38.360]  We reach 28 million people.
[01:38:39.230 --> 01:38:42.331]  And we now have scores of reporters and crew.
[01:38:42.331 --> 01:38:45.993]  We had one of the biggest stories this week, according to Google, number one.
[01:38:45.993 --> 01:38:49.095]  So that's the effect of what you can do as well.
[01:38:49.095 --> 01:39:00.020]  And your purchases of the books, the videos, the water filters, the high-quality nutraceuticals, all of it, at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com is helping build this.
[01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:05.062]  And we're doing an unprecedented sale that we've never done before, the biggest sale ever.
[01:39:05.062 --> 01:39:06.122]  It's a leap year sale.
[01:39:06.122 --> 01:39:06.823]  Never done this before.
[01:39:07.423 --> 01:39:08.744]  Biggest sale ever.
[01:39:08.744 --> 01:39:11.566]  30% off everything until Monday at midnight.
[01:39:11.566 --> 01:39:12.868]  Everything.
[01:39:12.868 --> 01:39:14.549]  30% off and free shipping.
[01:39:14.549 --> 01:39:17.131]  And that's on top of the discounts that are already there.
[01:39:17.131 --> 01:39:18.953]  We're losing money on many items.
[01:39:18.953 --> 01:39:20.954]  I just said things are so hot in the country right now.
[01:39:20.954 --> 01:39:22.736]  Things are so crazy.
[01:39:22.736 --> 01:39:24.457]  I said, let's have a giant sale.
[01:39:24.457 --> 01:39:26.139]  They said, you know, it's funny you say that.
[01:39:26.139 --> 01:39:28.380]  We're planning a leap year sale next Monday.
[01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:28.861]  24 hours only.
[01:39:28.861 --> 01:39:32.504]  I said, no, let's do it through the weekend and then through Monday and then not extend it.
[01:39:32.504 --> 01:39:33.405]  So I'm not extending it.
[01:39:33.925 --> 01:39:35.126]  I'm not extending it.
[01:39:35.126 --> 01:39:38.868]  This is the biggest sale ever in the history of InfoWars.
[01:39:38.868 --> 01:39:41.709]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com.
[01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:45.331]  You also sign up for auto shipping at 10% off on top of that.
[01:39:45.331 --> 01:39:46.412]  It is just crazy.
[01:39:46.412 --> 01:39:47.752]  And thank you all for your support.
[01:39:47.752 --> 01:39:48.793]  It's amazing.
[01:39:48.793 --> 01:39:54.056]  But also support Donald Trump with phone calls to media and by voting and by donating.
[01:39:54.056 --> 01:39:55.377]  You know, buy one of those.
[01:39:55.377 --> 01:39:56.297]  Make America Great.
[01:39:56.297 --> 01:39:57.798]  Again, hats that I've got one.
[01:39:57.978 --> 01:40:00.161]  It really makes the socialists mad downtown.
[01:40:00.161 --> 01:40:01.302]  It's beautiful.
[01:40:01.302 --> 01:40:06.468]  It's wonderful to exercise your free speech, because this guy just got banned off CNN, even though he was already banned.
[01:40:06.468 --> 01:40:09.171]  They wanted to announce it like they control the narrative.
[01:40:09.171 --> 01:40:11.413]  Now, I'm ranting, Mr. Stone.
[01:40:11.413 --> 01:40:14.757]  You've got the floor right through for the next 12 minutes until we go to break.
[01:40:15.518 --> 01:40:17.400]  Here's my big concern, Alex.
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:25.630]  Unlike with Ronald Reagan, at a certain point the political establishment realized that the Reagan avalanche could not be stopped.
[01:40:25.630 --> 01:40:29.974]  And therefore, first they tried to force former President Gerald Ford on him for Vice President.
[01:40:30.555 --> 01:40:32.917]  Then they ultimately did force George H.W.
[01:40:32.917 --> 01:40:33.477]  Bush on him.
[01:40:33.477 --> 01:40:35.099]  That was the price of peace.
[01:40:35.099 --> 01:40:37.541]  That was the price of a united Republican Party.
[01:40:37.541 --> 01:40:40.103]  Also, they began to see that Reagan could defeat Carter.
[01:40:40.103 --> 01:40:43.005]  And of course, they wanted to get their nose back into the trough.
[01:40:43.005 --> 01:40:44.606]  And they figured, don't worry about Reagan.
[01:40:44.606 --> 01:40:47.168]  Once he's president, we can surround him with our people.
[01:40:47.168 --> 01:40:48.089]  We can co-opt him.
[01:40:48.089 --> 01:40:49.910]  And that was back when we were still kind of two parties.
[01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:50.391]  Yes, indeed.
[01:40:50.931 --> 01:40:53.113]  Now, I have no illusions here.
[01:40:53.113 --> 01:40:54.514]  The Bushes have not given up.
[01:40:54.514 --> 01:41:01.060]  Terrific story in the New York Daily News about how the Bush family will now swing their weight first behind Marco Rubio.
[01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:05.483]  They put the little skirmish with Rubio, who is their protege, behind them.
[01:41:05.483 --> 01:41:08.226]  And now they are all out to stop Trump.
[01:41:09.927 --> 01:41:17.411]  Make no mistake about this, Barbara Bush will be out campaigning for Hillary Clinton this fall if Donald Trump is the nominee.
[01:41:17.411 --> 01:41:21.433]  So the financial wherewithal and the Bush... Well, they call each other family.
[01:41:21.433 --> 01:41:25.815]  They're very close because they've stolen together, because they've profiteered together.
[01:41:25.815 --> 01:41:28.036]  They've had fake charities together.
[01:41:28.036 --> 01:41:32.918]  Yes, four of them, all of which are complete and total financial scams.
[01:41:32.918 --> 01:41:34.599]  So don't write Jeb off.
[01:41:35.299 --> 01:41:41.503]  Jeb's now looking at four years from now, and they got George P. He's the land commissioner here in Texas.
[01:41:41.503 --> 01:41:43.124]  He's waiting in the wings.
[01:41:43.124 --> 01:41:45.366]  These people are criminals.
[01:41:45.366 --> 01:41:52.991]  They wrap themselves in patriotism, yet they've never made an honest dime in their lives, and they have profiteered mightily from the system.
[01:41:52.991 --> 01:41:56.553]  Don't think that Jeb is just licking his wounds and riding off into the sunshine.
[01:41:56.553 --> 01:41:57.994]  Folks, you need to understand.
[01:41:59.235 --> 01:42:05.659]  You're about to get the inside baseball on how they plan to sabotage Trump at the convention or pass that at the election.
[01:42:05.659 --> 01:42:08.101]  So give us the battle plan, General.
[01:42:08.101 --> 01:42:09.722]  Yes, here's what's going to happen.
[01:42:09.722 --> 01:42:14.524]  First of all, the rules for the convention have to be adopted before the convention.
[01:42:14.524 --> 01:42:17.146]  Most egregious is Rule 40B.
[01:42:17.146 --> 01:42:21.229]  This was originally passed by the Romney people to jam one of my heroes, Ron Paul.
[01:42:22.029 --> 01:42:33.993]  Ron Paul legitimately won delegates, but they didn't want those delegates even to be registered in the convention, and they wouldn't let this congressman, a Republican congressman, they would never allow his name to even be put in nomination.
[01:42:33.993 --> 01:42:43.316]  So they will take Rule 40B, which just before the convention, must be either readopted, or amended, or dropped, but they will use 40B.
[01:42:44.736 --> 01:42:55.040]  To allow someone who has not won a single delegate, who has not won a single caucus, or a single primary, to allow someone's name to be put on the floor.
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:57.661]  A white knight for the establishment.
[01:42:57.661 --> 01:43:05.104]  It would have been Jeb, but Jeb is now so discredited in this cycle, he is so bombed out with voters, that they know that's not credible.
[01:43:05.484 --> 01:43:08.647]  That's why Mitt Romney is all dressed up and ready to go.
[01:43:08.647 --> 01:43:14.553]  That's why Mitt Romney was viciously attacking Donald Trump on Twitter last night all through the debate.
[01:43:14.553 --> 01:43:17.236]  Mitt Romney is their, he's their horse.
[01:43:17.236 --> 01:43:20.039]  He's the horse they have on the sidelines waiting to bring him in.
[01:43:20.039 --> 01:43:21.240]  Now, explain how that happens.
[01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:24.881]  The Democrats have their superdelegate, the Republicans have something similar.
[01:43:24.881 --> 01:43:31.884]  If Trump doesn't get the certain number when they go the first round, they're at the convention when the people pledge their delegates.
[01:43:31.884 --> 01:43:32.265]  Yes.
[01:43:32.265 --> 01:43:35.966]  So are they planning to try to force Romney completely in or make him VP?
[01:43:35.966 --> 01:43:37.647]  Here's the steps that they would take.
[01:43:37.647 --> 01:43:42.849]  Number one, they will take away the fact that delegates are bound on the first ballot.
[01:43:42.849 --> 01:43:43.549]  Oh.
[01:43:43.549 --> 01:43:44.870]  Let's take New York for example.
[01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:51.794]  The delegation to the convention from New York State will be handpicked by the Republican State Chairman, Ed Cox.
[01:43:51.794 --> 01:44:05.163]  And by the way, just to back you up, it was in the news last night that 200 top Republicans met in secret, a bunch of them, basically the delegates, or the superdelegates of another name, in New York with Rubio's people on how to steal it.
[01:44:05.163 --> 01:44:06.704]  So all you're saying is facts.
[01:44:07.885 --> 01:44:08.325]  That's right.
[01:44:27.273 --> 01:44:28.634]  All of the binding is gone.
[01:44:28.634 --> 01:44:48.232]  So even though I expect Donald Trump to triumph in the New York primary, where his campaign is being run by one of the great organizers and rabble-rousers of all time, my friend Carl Palladino, and where they will thrash the establishment, upstate, downstate, on Long Island, in the New York suburbs, the will of the voters can be undone by these convention rules.
[01:44:48.232 --> 01:44:49.594]  Now, what I have done
[01:44:50.074 --> 01:45:01.302]  You start to reach out to some of my old associates, some of them going back to the Goldwater campaign, some of them going back to the Reagan campaign, to pull together some of the best convention operatives in America today.
[01:45:01.302 --> 01:45:09.848]  We have set up a fund to pay for their travel, to pay for their hotel rooms, to bring them to Cleveland to avoid the steal.
[01:45:09.848 --> 01:45:14.191]  You can go to StopTheSteal.com right now if you want to make a contribution.
[01:45:14.551 --> 01:45:15.331]  This is from the beginning.
[01:45:15.331 --> 01:45:19.193]  We're launching a major move to stop them stealing the will of the voters.
[01:45:19.193 --> 01:45:21.153]  This is how elections are really won, folks.
[01:45:21.153 --> 01:45:22.314]  And what we need is the pros.
[01:45:22.314 --> 01:45:26.615]  We need the people who know these rules and they know the ropes.
[01:45:26.615 --> 01:45:27.816]  Here's what I do know.
[01:45:27.816 --> 01:45:31.837]  The Bush people have manipulated the convention rules since the 80s.
[01:45:31.837 --> 01:45:36.559]  And they know the inside game and they're prepared to play the inside game.
[01:45:36.559 --> 01:45:38.059]  As you point out, there's 150 superdelegates.
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:44.161]  The superdelegates are Republican National Committee members and state chairs.
[01:45:44.161 --> 01:45:46.421]  Very few Donald Trump votes within that group.
[01:45:46.421 --> 01:45:53.623]  So, if you do the math, Trump doesn't have to win 50% of the delegates up for grabs in the primaries and caucuses.
[01:45:53.623 --> 01:45:55.963]  He's got to win 54%.
[01:45:55.963 --> 01:45:59.084]  Otherwise, he's short of the magic number, and that's what they seek to do.
[01:45:59.084 --> 01:46:02.184]  So we need a landslide, folks, to override this.
[01:46:02.184 --> 01:46:03.125]  Absolutely.
[01:46:03.125 --> 01:46:04.605]  And in all honesty, at this point,
[01:46:05.245 --> 01:46:07.687]  Ben Carson, who I do think is a patriot.
[01:46:07.687 --> 01:46:09.568]  Ted Cruz, who I don't think is a patriot.
[01:46:09.568 --> 01:46:15.552]  Ted Cruz, whose wife Heidi was Condoleezza Rice's deputy when they started the Iraq War.
[01:46:15.552 --> 01:46:17.294]  Then she went over to the U.S.
[01:46:17.294 --> 01:46:18.214]  trade representative.
[01:46:18.214 --> 01:46:20.776]  He is a Herbert Walker Bush minion, probably.
[01:46:20.776 --> 01:46:21.237]  No question.
[01:46:21.237 --> 01:46:23.078]  This is where he came from.
[01:46:23.078 --> 01:46:26.640]  Trump actually understated the case last night.
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:29.142]  Ted Cruz recruited John Roberts.
[01:46:29.142 --> 01:46:33.666]  Are you saying, because I believe you, and I don't want to admit this to myself because I wanted to believe in him.
[01:46:34.466 --> 01:46:39.230]  Cruz is like a Bush operative sleeper cell because the Bush name is over.
[01:46:39.230 --> 01:46:43.533]  He literally is a sleeper cell unless he's turned against him.
[01:46:43.533 --> 01:46:49.538]  But he was put in power by them as, I guess, a Tea Party takeover artist.
[01:46:49.538 --> 01:46:51.900]  Do you think he's turning against them or is he a full operative?
[01:46:53.121 --> 01:46:55.522]  In a minimum, I think he's a Trojan horse.
[01:46:55.522 --> 01:46:58.603]  This guy became a conservative exactly four years ago.
[01:46:58.603 --> 01:47:03.044]  Prior to that, he was the top issue advisor to Governor George W. Bush.
[01:47:03.044 --> 01:47:05.625]  He recruited John Roberts to the administration.
[01:47:05.625 --> 01:47:06.746]  Now let's look at his wife, Heidi.
[01:47:06.746 --> 01:47:08.166]  I'm sure she's a nice lady.
[01:47:08.166 --> 01:47:08.886]  Holman Sachs.
[01:47:08.886 --> 01:47:14.148]  She was the Deputy Assistant National Security Advisor when they gave us the phony Iraq War.
[01:47:14.148 --> 01:47:15.388]  Then she moved over to the U.S.
[01:47:15.388 --> 01:47:18.129]  Trade Representative's office, where she was the Deputy U.S.
[01:47:18.129 --> 01:47:19.650]  Trade Representative working on
[01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:21.531]  China policy.
[01:47:21.531 --> 01:47:24.374]  That China policy Donald Trump talked so much about.
[01:47:24.374 --> 01:47:28.517]  By the way, if you go to her wiki bio, those things have been airbrushed out of existence.
[01:47:28.517 --> 01:47:30.439]  Then she goes to Goldman Sachs.
[01:47:30.439 --> 01:47:40.528]  Goldman Sachs made a million dollar, sweetheart, special interest loan to fund Ted Cruz's assent to the Senate.
[01:47:40.528 --> 01:47:42.590]  Now, in the beginning I liked Ted Cruz.
[01:47:42.590 --> 01:47:43.611]  I liked what he had to say.
[01:47:43.611 --> 01:47:45.233]  He sounded to me like a patriot.
[01:47:45.233 --> 01:47:46.314]  Folks, he's a quizling!
[01:47:46.954 --> 01:47:48.816]  He's a Trojan horse.
[01:47:48.816 --> 01:47:50.697]  He's one of them.
[01:47:50.697 --> 01:47:54.640]  And he too plays a role in this effort to block Donald Trump.
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:56.642]  His role now is very clear.
[01:47:56.642 --> 01:47:59.404]  Siphon conservative votes from Trump.
[01:47:59.404 --> 01:48:01.266]  Siphon Liberty votes from Trump.
[01:48:01.266 --> 01:48:06.850]  Yeah, I mean, the conservatives don't see the full power of Soran, the full power of the Newell Orders against Trump.
[01:48:06.850 --> 01:48:07.971]  This is not a ruse.
[01:48:07.971 --> 01:48:08.852]  It's real.
[01:48:08.852 --> 01:48:11.073]  He's causing irrevocable damage to him.
[01:48:11.073 --> 01:48:12.455]  If people don't get behind Trump,
[01:48:13.295 --> 01:48:15.557]  Hillary will destroy a Cruz or a Rubio.
[01:48:15.557 --> 01:48:16.938]  Rubio is obviously a ringer.
[01:48:16.938 --> 01:48:19.180]  Yeah, they're waiting to make him president down the road.
[01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:21.542]  If you don't get behind Trump, you're totally insane.
[01:48:21.542 --> 01:48:23.843]  And Alex, I know this is an absolute fact.
[01:48:23.843 --> 01:48:32.670]  At this very moment, Ted Cruz is trying to broker a deal with Marco Rubio on which he will continue to damage Trump in return for a Supreme Court seat.
[01:48:32.670 --> 01:48:33.411]  That's what he wants.
[01:48:34.071 --> 01:48:45.807]  He's not only an oily lawyer, a slick operator, I like to call him Tricky Ted, this string of sophomoric dirty tricks is beyond anything that I've seen, and I believe in hardboard politics.
[01:48:45.807 --> 01:48:46.328]  I get it.
[01:48:46.328 --> 01:48:50.113]  Yeah, they call you super dirty trickster, but I looked at the stuff you did, none of that was dirty.
[01:48:50.273 --> 01:49:07.547]  Well, first of all, it was all legal, and politics ain't beanbag, but that's not the same thing as sending threatening letters to voters to make them vote, or spreading a false rumor on CNN that Ben Carson, a patriot, is getting out of the race and then contacting Carson voters to tell them the latest.
[01:49:07.547 --> 01:49:08.608]  Oh, did you hear?
[01:49:08.608 --> 01:49:09.709]  Ben's getting out of the race.
[01:49:09.709 --> 01:49:10.910]  Switch your vote to Ted Cruz.
[01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:15.933]  Doctoring pictures of Barack Obama and Marco Rubio shaking hands?
[01:49:15.933 --> 01:49:26.240]  Last time I saw that was in 1950, when Joe McCarthy doctored pictures of the liberal senator from Maryland, Millard Tidings, shaking hands with the president of the U.S.
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:31.684]  Communist Party, Earl Broward, which blew Tidings out of the Senate.
[01:49:31.684 --> 01:49:32.525]  That's a dirty trick.
[01:49:32.525 --> 01:49:38.269]  So we need a tsunami, but if we don't get the total tsunami because of stuff going on in the states, it looks like that's where it's going now.
[01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:51.880]  How do we stop them there on the floor by putting Patriot operatives in to basically be there from the beginning saying, we're watching for it, we know it's coming, so that if they even try it, it blows up in their face.
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:54.822]  Because this isn't past years when folks were asleep.
[01:49:54.822 --> 01:49:58.885]  If they try to steal this from the people, I think there'll be civil unrest.
[01:49:58.885 --> 01:50:05.170]  Well, that's why I've had to reach out to a number of veteran conservative operatives, people who know the rules as well as the Bushes.
[01:50:05.170 --> 01:50:06.271]  We're not without assets.
[01:50:06.271 --> 01:50:07.813]  We're not without solid delegation.
[01:50:08.453 --> 01:50:09.874]  Pat Buchanan, I know, is supporting Trump.
[01:50:09.874 --> 01:50:11.374]  We ought to bring him down to the floor.
[01:50:11.374 --> 01:50:13.656]  We need to bring all these titans in.
[01:50:13.656 --> 01:50:16.917]  That's exactly why we have set up StopTheSteal.com.
[01:50:16.917 --> 01:50:21.840]  We need to get Matt Drudge, obviously, who likes Trump and loves Trump, you know, he'll be involved watching for the steal.
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:27.703]  Yeah, so I think that, you know, just like anything else, you shed light on the cockroaches and the cockroaches will scramble.
[01:50:27.703 --> 01:50:30.564]  We're going to have to shed light on what they have in mind.
[01:50:30.564 --> 01:50:32.545]  Terrific piece in the Daily Beast the other day.
[01:50:32.545 --> 01:50:33.826]  They blurted it out.
[01:50:33.826 --> 01:50:36.127]  Yes, they're playing for the brokered convention.
[01:50:36.727 --> 01:50:37.628]  Who emerges?
[01:50:37.628 --> 01:50:38.449]  Is it Mitt Romney?
[01:50:38.449 --> 01:50:39.550]  Is it Marco Rubio?
[01:50:39.550 --> 01:50:40.771]  Is it John Kasich?
[01:50:40.771 --> 01:50:42.053]  I think they've given up on Joe.
[01:50:42.053 --> 01:50:47.899]  But after this spectacle of Trump and he's the winner, if they don't give it to him, the public's finally going to get it.
[01:50:47.899 --> 01:50:49.380]  And I mean, this is incredible.
[01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:53.384]  But on the one hand, you could say the party nomination would be worth nothing if they steal it from Trump.
[01:50:53.384 --> 01:50:55.927]  On the other hand, the insiders don't care about that.
[01:50:55.927 --> 01:50:57.348]  Exactly, because they got Hillary already.
[01:50:57.348 --> 01:50:58.189]  This is epic.
[01:50:58.189 --> 01:50:58.810]  This is epic.

[01:54:20.488 --> 01:54:30.017]  It's stopthesteal.org is the website if you want to try to recruit people like Pat Buchanan, you name it, to be on the floor.
[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:36.521]  Talking to the media, invading, and making sure they don't steal the election from the people.
[01:54:36.521 --> 01:54:38.521]  And they've done this before.
[01:54:38.521 --> 01:54:39.762]  So it's key.
[01:54:39.762 --> 01:54:44.262]  Again, that's StopTheSteal.org, and everybody should get involved.

[01:54:50.924 --> 01:54:55.224]  A lot of key questions for the consummate Trump insider, Roger Stone.
[01:54:55.224 --> 01:54:57.205]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:54:57.205 --> 01:54:58.565]  His two new books are out.
[01:54:59.145 --> 01:55:00.526]  And of course they came out in the last few months.
[01:55:00.526 --> 01:55:03.949]  You notice you suddenly hear Trump basically talking about everything in these.
[01:55:03.949 --> 01:55:05.990]  The Clinton's war on women.
[01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:09.453]  And then of course we also have Jeb and the Bush crime family.
[01:55:09.453 --> 01:55:17.779]  But I tell you these are important books for folks to get to be educated as you attack the political establishment that are merged at the hip, call each other family.
[01:55:17.779 --> 01:55:19.000]  But to a great extent
[01:55:20.117 --> 01:55:21.018]  I mean, let's just say it.
[01:55:21.018 --> 01:55:24.040]  You have been, and folks, I don't just say stuff, everybody knows that.
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:35.188]  You've been the prime mover in getting mainstream media to face the fact of the sex crimes of the Clintons and the Bush CIA drug running and the MENA and how these two families work together.
[01:55:35.188 --> 01:55:39.711]  And as soon as they brought out 9-11 Truth, Jeb's numbers went down, Jeb pulled out,
[01:55:40.451 --> 01:55:41.932]  Because they were scared to death.
[01:55:41.932 --> 01:55:44.053]  Our reporters confronted him twice.
[01:55:44.053 --> 01:55:45.554]  And they tried to call it a conspiracy theory.
[01:55:45.554 --> 01:55:46.654]  His numbers only went up.
[01:55:46.654 --> 01:55:47.975]  There are 28 pages.
[01:55:47.975 --> 01:55:50.056]  We did attack the wrong country.
[01:55:50.056 --> 01:55:53.698]  What do you have to say about the whole Bush dynasty and where all this is going?
[01:55:54.497 --> 01:55:58.400]  Alex, a year ago, more than a year ago, I set out with two goals.
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:03.004]  One was to defeat Hillary Clinton, and the other was to elect Donald Trump.
[01:56:03.004 --> 01:56:05.246]  And I knew that meant vanquishing Jeb Bush.
[01:56:05.246 --> 01:56:16.134]  Jeb took a powder because my book lays out how he has never made an honest dime in his life, how he has used the governorship and his family connections to profiteer, and done so at the expense of the taxpayers.
[01:56:16.134 --> 01:56:20.878]  Between Lehman Brothers and Enron, the taxpayers of Florida lost one billion dollars.
[01:56:20.878 --> 01:56:20.958]  SNL!
[01:56:20.958 --> 01:56:23.660]  The whole family is a scamming weasel!
[01:56:23.860 --> 01:56:25.120]  There's no question.
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:29.422]  And they, I don't think they ever expected anybody to put it all together.
[01:56:29.422 --> 01:56:30.262]  So it's there.
[01:56:30.262 --> 01:56:35.664]  Trump builds stuff and is a TV star and an entrepreneur and a celebrity and loves America.
[01:56:35.664 --> 01:56:39.846]  The Bushes literally were the main Nazi lawyers, Prescott Bush.
[01:56:39.846 --> 01:56:42.367]  They literally organized crime.
[01:56:42.367 --> 01:56:43.427]  Scum of the earth.
[01:56:43.587 --> 01:56:45.428]  Yeah, look, the Bushes would steal a hot stove.
[01:56:45.428 --> 01:56:47.328]  They've never made an honest dollar in their life.
[01:56:47.328 --> 01:56:49.129]  They've traded on the family name.
[01:56:49.129 --> 01:56:50.249]  This is a classic deal.
[01:56:50.249 --> 01:56:51.590]  You go to an SNL.
[01:56:51.590 --> 01:56:54.951]  You take out a fraudulent loan that you know you're never going to honor.
[01:56:54.951 --> 01:56:56.411]  Then you take the money from the loan.
[01:56:56.411 --> 01:56:58.332]  You short the stock in the bank.
[01:56:58.332 --> 01:57:02.333]  Then the bank falls and you cash in, leaving the taxpayers holding the bag.
[01:57:02.333 --> 01:57:03.613]  That's what Neil Bush did.
[01:57:03.613 --> 01:57:04.994]  That's what Marvin Bush did.
[01:57:04.994 --> 01:57:06.474]  That's what Jeb Bush did.
[01:57:06.474 --> 01:57:08.955]  Jeb works with third world African dictators.
[01:57:09.195 --> 01:57:15.419]  Well, look, the guy got a $4 million personal taxpayer finance bailout when daddy was the vice president.
[01:57:15.419 --> 01:57:22.964]  He defrauded an SNL broader... And Donald Trump had the nerve to go up against a crime family nobody messes with.
[01:57:22.964 --> 01:57:24.285]  And I want to show this a broader film.
[01:57:24.285 --> 01:57:25.866]  And I don't say this to be theatrical.
[01:57:25.866 --> 01:57:28.648]  I said, let me tell you, they're looking at killing him and trying to figure it out.
[01:57:29.088 --> 01:57:30.629]  I mean, I know politics.
[01:57:30.629 --> 01:57:31.410]  He's real.
[01:57:31.410 --> 01:57:34.892]  That's why I'm so behind him, because he's in the arena, folks.
[01:57:34.892 --> 01:57:37.213]  It's easy to sit here and bitch and complain because he's not perfect.
[01:57:37.213 --> 01:57:39.194]  That guy is in the arena against the globalists.
[01:57:39.194 --> 01:57:40.355]  You want it, you got it.
[01:57:40.355 --> 01:57:41.716]  That's what most of these questions are.
[01:57:41.716 --> 01:57:44.758]  You know, he's wearing a bulletproof vest, the whole nine yards.
[01:57:44.758 --> 01:57:46.299]  I just pray to God nothing happens to him.
[01:57:46.559 --> 01:57:53.043]  Well, this is one of the key points last night, which is the IRS harassment now of Trump is an added dimension.
[01:57:53.043 --> 01:58:01.409]  I mean, not only are they out of control, but rather than yanking the tax status of the Clinton Foundation, where the Clinton Foundation filings
[01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:08.055]  And their state filings and their federal filings are completely and totally permeated with fraud.
[01:58:08.055 --> 01:58:10.878]  Rather than going after the Clintons, what's the IRS doing?
[01:58:10.878 --> 01:58:12.439]  They're going after Donald Trump.
[01:58:12.439 --> 01:58:14.521]  They're harassing an honest businessman.
[01:58:14.521 --> 01:58:15.843]  I haven't seen his tax returns.
[01:58:15.843 --> 01:58:17.024]  I guarantee you this.
[01:58:17.024 --> 01:58:18.365]  He's paying millions in taxes.
[01:58:18.365 --> 01:58:19.886]  It's gonna backfire.
[01:58:19.886 --> 01:58:21.288]  It's gonna backfire.
[01:58:21.288 --> 01:58:22.709]  They got the IRS running around.
[01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:26.712]  10,000 times what Nixon did with the IRS.
[01:58:26.712 --> 01:58:27.373]  I mean, literally.
[01:58:27.373 --> 01:58:28.694]  Nixon actually never did anything with the IRS.
[01:58:28.694 --> 01:58:29.414]  That's why I say 10,000 times.
[01:58:29.414 --> 01:58:30.275]  He only talked about it.
[01:58:30.275 --> 01:58:32.296]  But the IRS was completely unresponsive.
[01:58:32.296 --> 01:58:32.576]  Exactly.
[01:58:32.576 --> 01:58:38.420]  So they're running around persecuting everybody, you know, right of Mao Zedong, and then they're saying Trump's bad.
[01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:42.443]  Back in 70 seconds, with the third hour, your call straight up.
[01:58:42.443 --> 01:58:44.604]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:48.410 --> 01:58:49.231]  Hey, everyone!
[01:58:49.231 --> 01:58:51.532]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:58:51.532 --> 01:58:55.375]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:58:55.375 --> 01:58:57.456]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:58:57.456 --> 01:59:07.723]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:59:07.723 --> 01:59:13.707]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:59:14.107 --> 01:59:14.527]  We're good to go!
[01:59:29.104 --> 01:59:30.585]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:11.377 --> 02:00:19.867]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:00:19.867 --> 02:00:24.212]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:24.212 --> 02:00:28.397]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:00:28.397 --> 02:00:29.979]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.071 --> 02:00:33.231]  We are a resistance.
[02:00:33.231 --> 02:00:35.632]  The country got taken over by foreign interests and globalists.
[02:00:35.632 --> 02:00:36.773]  They brag about it.
[02:00:36.773 --> 02:00:39.813]  China says, hey, we'll tell you what movies you can put out.
[02:00:39.813 --> 02:00:44.675]  Mexican president says, you apologize to me, you filthy Americans.
[02:00:44.675 --> 02:00:49.857]  The Pope comes here and has 200 foot walls around his house, but we can't have walls.
[02:00:49.857 --> 02:00:50.757]  We're a joke.
[02:00:50.757 --> 02:00:54.898]  And then Joe Biden apologizes to Mexico.
[02:00:54.898 --> 02:00:56.799]  And we've got everybody lined up against Trump.
[02:00:58.510 --> 02:01:00.472]  I want to come back in the next segment and go to some calls.
[02:01:00.472 --> 02:01:06.037]  We have THE Trump Insider, Roger Stone, StoneZone.com in studio with us right now.
[02:01:06.037 --> 02:01:10.661]  His two new books, best sellers available in hardback, discounted at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:01:10.661 --> 02:01:13.163]  We have 30% off, never done a sale like this.
[02:01:13.163 --> 02:01:15.465]  And free shipping, only running until Monday.
[02:01:15.465 --> 02:01:16.806]  And that's on his books too.
[02:01:16.806 --> 02:01:17.566]  Take advantage of this.
[02:01:17.566 --> 02:01:19.949]  Plus his books are selling out, by the way, on our site.
[02:01:20.629 --> 02:01:22.612]  Uh, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:01:22.612 --> 02:01:30.102]  We're going to take calls, but I want to just ask you as a guy that's worked inside, was it three, four administrations at the highest levels, worked on nine campaigns.
[02:01:31.738 --> 02:01:32.659]  We've always had elites.
[02:01:32.659 --> 02:01:33.600]  We've had boss hogs.
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:34.661]  Nobody's perfect.
[02:01:34.661 --> 02:01:37.964]  But the old elites wanted a prosperous country so they could skim more off the top.
[02:01:37.964 --> 02:01:38.745]  Nobody's perfect.
[02:01:38.745 --> 02:01:40.447]  I'm not, you know, an idiot.
[02:01:40.447 --> 02:01:41.588]  But they still loved America.
[02:01:41.588 --> 02:01:42.789]  They loved their kids and their grandkids.
[02:01:42.789 --> 02:01:45.392]  The elites we have now hate bitter clingers.
[02:01:45.392 --> 02:01:46.593]  They hate men.
[02:01:46.593 --> 02:01:47.594]  They hate prosperity.
[02:01:47.594 --> 02:01:48.515]  They hate language.
[02:01:48.515 --> 02:01:49.777]  They hate freedom.
[02:01:49.777 --> 02:01:53.440]  What would you call this elite and the liberals that want to control speech?
[02:01:54.261 --> 02:01:57.604]  I call them cult leaders, like Jim Jones cult leaders.
[02:01:57.604 --> 02:02:00.907]  I mean, I don't know how else to describe what they're doing to our kids.
[02:02:00.907 --> 02:02:02.669]  This is a pack of scum.
[02:02:02.669 --> 02:02:04.170]  I'm not trying to be nasty.
[02:02:04.170 --> 02:02:06.873]  They're just the worst people the world's ever seen.
[02:02:06.873 --> 02:02:08.134]  Who are these people?
[02:02:08.134 --> 02:02:10.316]  You've been there, you've watched the de-evolution.
[02:02:10.316 --> 02:02:12.819]  Who are these people, and who are the Republicans that work with them?
[02:02:13.476 --> 02:02:14.357]  Well, they're traitors.
[02:02:14.357 --> 02:02:16.339]  I think that's the key word.
[02:02:16.339 --> 02:02:18.561]  And the good news is, look, we've got them on the run.
[02:02:18.561 --> 02:02:22.585]  I don't want to act like Harry Truman, but here's one of the proudest moments of my life.
[02:02:22.585 --> 02:02:24.987]  Bush drops as field narrows.
[02:02:24.987 --> 02:02:27.009]  We drove him out of this race.
[02:02:27.009 --> 02:02:27.730]  Why?
[02:02:27.730 --> 02:02:32.014]  By exposing his family's profiteering and their treason.
[02:02:32.014 --> 02:02:33.415]  And he pledged to never quit.
[02:02:33.415 --> 02:02:33.916]  Never quit.
[02:02:34.056 --> 02:02:43.368]  But was it, was the holy water and the giant silver cross at high noon when Trump came out and said, you let 9-11 happen, you attacked the wrong country, and I'm going to release those pages?
[02:02:43.368 --> 02:02:48.955]  And what he's really afraid of is the fact that there were 28 individual complaints or tips
[02:02:49.535 --> 02:02:49.795]  Yes.
[02:02:49.795 --> 02:02:52.297]  That makes Jeb Bush an accessory in the attack on 9-11.
[02:02:52.297 --> 02:02:56.440]  And he was afraid, and this is all in my book, that Donald Trump would go there.
[02:03:17.025 --> 02:03:18.465]  Look at that headline.
[02:03:18.465 --> 02:03:19.826]  Trump insider.
[02:03:19.826 --> 02:03:20.706]  Bush.
[02:03:20.706 --> 02:03:22.146]  Jeb Bush.
[02:03:22.146 --> 02:03:23.686]  Bush's accessory on 9-11.
[02:03:23.686 --> 02:03:24.426]  And it's true!
[02:03:24.426 --> 02:03:25.527]  And it's sensational!
[02:03:25.527 --> 02:03:26.807]  And we can destroy them!
[02:03:26.807 --> 02:03:28.687]  They want to intimidate us all day?
[02:03:28.687 --> 02:03:30.508]  Let's get in the arena with Donald Trump!
[02:03:30.508 --> 02:03:31.648]  That's why I admire Donald Trump.
[02:03:31.648 --> 02:03:34.008]  I've been in the arena, at a lesser level, I know the danger.
[02:03:34.008 --> 02:03:36.589]  You're in the arena, you're in danger, no doubt.
[02:03:36.589 --> 02:03:37.509]  All the death threats you get.
[02:03:37.509 --> 02:03:38.469]  And we're just saying, you know what?
[02:03:38.469 --> 02:03:40.250]  Screw you, go to hell.
[02:03:40.250 --> 02:03:41.990]  You want it, you got it, we're going up against you.
[02:03:42.130 --> 02:03:49.712]  Dilk, just last week a reporter who's a friend of mine asked Jeb Bush about my book, and he said, Roger Stone's crazy.
[02:03:49.712 --> 02:03:55.934]  Boy, they didn't think I was crazy when they asked me to go to Miami-Dade in 2000 and take care of the recount for them, which I did.
[02:03:55.934 --> 02:03:57.515]  By the way, greatest regret of my life.
[02:03:57.515 --> 02:03:58.995]  I remember seeing you on TV.
[02:03:58.995 --> 02:04:01.516]  I thought that he would actually be a compassionate conservative.
[02:04:01.516 --> 02:04:08.158]  I have to admit, until I began the research for my book on the Kennedy assassination, I never really realized
[02:04:08.678 --> 02:04:09.899]  How evil the Bushes were.
[02:04:09.899 --> 02:04:12.141]  I knew that they were self-dealers.
[02:04:12.141 --> 02:04:13.722]  I knew that they were crony capitalists.
[02:04:13.722 --> 02:04:15.343]  I knew they weren't conservatives.
[02:04:15.343 --> 02:04:16.364]  I'm from Connecticut.
[02:04:16.364 --> 02:04:18.225]  I fought them back in the day.
[02:04:18.225 --> 02:04:23.269]  I had no idea of the enormous scope of the theft and the evil.
[02:04:23.269 --> 02:04:26.091]  People say to me, how can you criticize George H.W.
[02:04:26.091 --> 02:04:26.331]  Bush?
[02:04:26.331 --> 02:04:27.171]  He's a war hero.
[02:04:27.171 --> 02:04:27.872]  Really?
[02:04:27.872 --> 02:04:29.533]  That's not what the guys on his plane say.
[02:04:30.714 --> 02:04:31.575]  Yeah, he punched out.
[02:04:31.575 --> 02:04:32.735]  And let others die.
[02:04:32.735 --> 02:04:33.536]  So he... Stay there.
[02:04:33.536 --> 02:04:34.056]  This is epic.
[02:04:34.056 --> 02:04:38.699]  I want to come back and give you the floor to start back over with this without me interrupting and just get in.
[02:04:38.699 --> 02:04:43.042]  Because every time I... I mean, I knew who you were when I met you years ago and obviously knew you were high-powered.
[02:04:43.042 --> 02:04:45.944]  But the more I researched you, you've been involved in everything.
[02:04:45.944 --> 02:04:49.446]  You're such an insider to now turn against him in the last decade.
[02:04:49.446 --> 02:04:52.188]  I can only salute Roger Stone for his courage, folks.
[02:04:52.188 --> 02:04:54.590]  They are scared to death of this man.
[02:04:54.590 --> 02:04:55.330]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:55.330 --> 02:04:56.211]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:04:56.211 --> 02:04:57.752]  And they're scared of you too, the people!
[02:05:00.402 --> 02:05:05.945]  It turns out Hillary Clinton and her top aides aren't the only ones with secret email aliases.
[02:05:05.945 --> 02:05:16.410]  Documents uncovered through the Freedom of Information Act reveal that former Attorney General Eric Holder used a false name for his official Justice Department email account.
[02:05:16.410 --> 02:05:20.892]  According to documents obtained by Vice News, all mentions of Lou Alcindor
[02:05:21.352 --> 02:05:27.075]  The birth name of basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar were actually referring to Holder himself.
[02:05:27.075 --> 02:05:38.621]  In response to the FOIA release, a Justice Department spokesman said that Holder's actions, they're not improper, legally questionable, or used to thwart FOIA requests seeking information on the former Attorney General.
[02:05:38.621 --> 02:05:40.562]  Hmm, where have we heard that before?
[02:05:40.562 --> 02:05:50.847]  Experts in FOIA law say Holder's Lou Alcindor identity calls into question the ability of FOIA staff to locate all emails from an official who uses an alias.
[02:05:51.568 --> 02:05:52.348]  Indeed.
[02:05:52.348 --> 02:05:57.514]  You can read more at InfoWars.com.
[02:05:57.514 --> 02:06:04.862]  Our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[02:06:05.316 --> 02:06:08.479]  I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months.
[02:06:08.479 --> 02:06:14.183]  I needed to get my digestive system working correctly again, so I stumbled on the X2.
[02:06:14.183 --> 02:06:14.944]  I needed a detox, basically.

[02:06:46.908 --> 02:06:48.710]  I was like really more natural.

[02:08:22.376 --> 02:08:26.178]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:26.178 --> 02:08:34.682]  Bubbling on the back burner of global public consciousness sits nothing less than an orchestrated full-scale invasion of cultures.
[02:08:34.682 --> 02:08:38.904]  AFP reports, as of Tuesday morning, 102,547 people had arrived in Greece,
[02:08:43.166 --> 02:08:49.511]  While another 7,507 had arrived in Italy since the beginning of the year.
[02:08:49.511 --> 02:08:57.458]  Last year, the 100,000 mark was only topped during summer, IOM spokesman Itayi Variri told reporters.
[02:08:57.458 --> 02:09:03.623]  An estimated 35,000 migrants and refugees have reached the Greek islands so far in February alone.
[02:09:03.923 --> 02:09:11.552]  Adding that nearly half of them were Syrians and a quarter were Afghanistan, while another 17% were from Iraq.
[02:09:11.552 --> 02:09:15.977]  Once they reach Greece, almost all attempt to move on, he said.
[02:09:15.977 --> 02:09:22.926]  Adding that, we understand that an estimated 26,000 have already passed the Greek border in February alone.
[02:09:23.306 --> 02:09:33.112]  Nearly 20,000 Afghans have arrived in Greece by sea so far this year, along with nearly 31,000 Syrians and more than 12,000 Iraqis.
[02:09:33.112 --> 02:09:39.717]  As Europe plummets into chaos, Norway threatens to abandon the Geneva Convention and for good reason.
[02:09:39.717 --> 02:09:49.183]  Kurt Nimmo writes, the failure of the borderless Schengen area scheme implemented by the European Union has prompted Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg
[02:09:49.443 --> 02:09:55.688]  To warn her country, we'll abandon the Geneva Convention and close the border if Sweden collapses.
[02:09:55.688 --> 02:10:05.255]  Solberg added, the rejection of the EU Schengen Area will be imposed in the event that it all breaks down, that the flow of refugees just comes and they all end up in Norway.
[02:10:05.255 --> 02:10:08.838]  Because we're at the top of Europe, Norway is the end point.
[02:10:09.298 --> 02:10:19.783]  In October, Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallström said the tidal wave of immigrants entering the country has destabilized the government and placed an immense burden on its socialist system.
[02:10:19.783 --> 02:10:27.346]  In response, the government has looked abroad to borrow money and is now considering hiking taxes on citizens to pay for the influx.
[02:10:27.346 --> 02:10:35.150]  Wallström said, I think most people feel that we cannot maintain a system where perhaps 190,000 people will arrive every year.
[02:10:35.150 --> 02:10:37.971]  In the long run, our system will collapse.
[02:10:38.331 --> 02:10:44.856]  But those voices have been muted as the clampdown on the public consensus in Europe is escalating.
[02:10:44.856 --> 02:10:54.584]  RT reports German police have reportedly launched an investigation into the cops who leaked internal reports of mass harassment and assaults on New Year's Eve in Cologne to the media.
[02:10:54.704 --> 02:11:00.368]  The German press only learned about the outrageous sex attacks four days after the incidents.
[02:11:00.368 --> 02:11:06.912]  Cologne police recently launched an investigation to find those who had spread the secret information without permission.
[02:11:06.912 --> 02:11:11.956]  The authorities are determined to find out how internal police reports became public.
[02:11:11.956 --> 02:11:24.564]  Meanwhile, back in the United States, the Daily Caller reports the Obama administration will no longer ban immigrants with three sexually transmitted diseases and bacterial infections from entering the country.
[02:11:24.784 --> 02:11:35.014]  According to the Center for Immigration Studies, the Department of Health and Human Services announced the rule January 26th and it goes into effect on March 28th.
[02:11:35.014 --> 02:11:48.808]  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decided to remove cacroid, granuloma inguinal, and lymphogranuloma venereum from the list of inadmissible diseases for an immigrant seeking to enter the country.
[02:11:49.028 --> 02:11:55.070]  The Obama administration estimates that the change would not cost more than $100 million.
[02:11:55.070 --> 02:12:06.214]  In President Barack Obama's first year in office, the Department of Health and Human Services decided that HIV was no longer a communicable disease of public health significance.
[02:12:06.214 --> 02:12:10.195]  Obama's endangerment of the American people knows no bounds.
[02:12:10.515 --> 02:12:22.820]  Keeping tabs on the unyielding invasion of immigrants with the sole purpose of eliminating European culture and reducing the United States to a third world country has gradually become a distant talking point.
[02:12:22.820 --> 02:12:24.701]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[02:12:26.842 --> 02:12:27.782]  And we are back.
[02:12:27.782 --> 02:12:30.284]  That special report is really scary.
[02:12:30.284 --> 02:12:32.306]  Europe is now on the verge of collapse.
[02:12:32.306 --> 02:12:33.267]  France is saying that.
[02:12:33.267 --> 02:12:34.708]  Sweden is saying that.
[02:12:34.708 --> 02:12:38.891]  The highway system in France has over a million people living on the highways.
[02:12:38.891 --> 02:12:40.653]  This is mainstream news.
[02:12:40.653 --> 02:12:44.836]  Attacking people's cars and tourists and women and trucks.
[02:12:44.836 --> 02:12:45.757]  Go to YouTube and type in
[02:12:46.787 --> 02:12:47.888]  We're good.
[02:13:07.398 --> 02:13:08.839]  Plane loads come into the U.S.
[02:13:08.839 --> 02:13:10.180]  They don't even check their IDs.
[02:13:10.180 --> 02:13:12.441]  That's in the New York Daily News.
[02:13:12.441 --> 02:13:14.002]  That's in the New York Post.
[02:13:14.002 --> 02:13:15.683]  And no one gets in trouble.
[02:13:15.683 --> 02:13:20.367]  And then Donald Trump says, we have to stop people coming in until they at least vet them.
[02:13:20.367 --> 02:13:21.247]  And then it's in the news.
[02:13:21.247 --> 02:13:25.890]  No, Obama won't even let governors know the names or the numbers.
[02:13:25.890 --> 02:13:28.772]  This is the suicide of the country, the suicide of Europe.
[02:13:28.772 --> 02:13:34.676]  Trump insider Roger Stone, I want to get back into the Bush crime family and recap what you were just breaking down and how big that is.
[02:13:34.676 --> 02:13:35.657]  And then I want to go to phone calls.
[02:13:36.963 --> 02:13:42.627]  Donald Trump says the most common sense stuff you can imagine, and they turn it around and act like it's crazy.
[02:13:42.627 --> 02:13:44.668]  Yeah, they try to say that it's so simple.
[02:13:44.668 --> 02:13:46.169]  It's so simple when it is simple.
[02:13:46.169 --> 02:13:47.430]  We need to seal our borders.
[02:13:47.430 --> 02:13:48.891]  Look what's happening in Cologne.
[02:13:48.891 --> 02:13:56.096]  You've got these hordes of people raping, killing, taking over public facilities, defecating in a child's pool.
[02:13:56.896 --> 02:14:00.818]  Raping people in the clubhouse.
[02:14:00.818 --> 02:14:01.899]  In mass.
[02:14:01.899 --> 02:14:07.121]  This is what we have to look forward to in this country unless we secure our borders.
[02:14:07.121 --> 02:14:19.067]  So the fact that Trump wants to make America safe again, not only great, but safe again, driving the establishment and the globalists crazy because they see the hordes that are coming here.
[02:14:19.067 --> 02:14:20.408]  Only Trump will stop this.
[02:14:20.408 --> 02:14:22.169]  There's no American political figure
[02:14:22.569 --> 02:14:25.091]  And I hate it when Trump refers to himself as a politician.
[02:14:25.091 --> 02:14:27.092]  He's the anti-politician.
[02:14:27.092 --> 02:14:28.813]  He is not a politician.
[02:14:28.813 --> 02:14:29.713]  He's a leader.
[02:14:29.713 --> 02:14:32.015]  And he's the leader America needs right now.
[02:14:32.015 --> 02:14:34.757]  Well, he is the symbol now of nationalism.
[02:14:34.757 --> 02:14:37.758]  One of the few things I think he just gets a little wrong is this whole Apple thing.
[02:14:37.758 --> 02:14:40.200]  Because the FBI's like, can you just get this one phone for us?
[02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:43.002]  Well, there isn't a program for that yet.
[02:14:43.002 --> 02:14:45.864]  They can go to the phone company and get all the records and the ISP.
[02:14:45.864 --> 02:14:47.965]  So I think it's, I mean, nobody's perfect.
[02:14:48.566 --> 02:14:50.112]  I think he's a little wrong on that.
[02:14:50.112 --> 02:14:52.119]  He's right saying, hey, we know they're terrorists.
[02:14:52.119 --> 02:14:53.063]  We know they did this.
[02:14:53.063 --> 02:14:53.766]  Break into the phone.
[02:14:54.577 --> 02:14:57.899]  But they've misrepresented, the FBI has, what they're asking for, in my view.
[02:14:57.899 --> 02:14:59.280]  Well, is Donald Trump perfect?
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:00.241]  No, he's not perfect.
[02:15:00.241 --> 02:15:03.403]  I'm sure if I looked at it, I'd find some areas that we disagree on.
[02:15:03.403 --> 02:15:06.885]  But on the big picture issues... The establishment is scared.
[02:15:06.885 --> 02:15:07.685]  Why does the sheep?
[02:15:07.685 --> 02:15:11.188]  Yeah, because he will refire and revitalize our economy.
[02:15:11.188 --> 02:15:12.669]  He will rebuild our military.
[02:15:12.669 --> 02:15:14.530]  He will seal our borders.
[02:15:14.530 --> 02:15:17.912]  And we will finally have a foreign policy that makes sense.
[02:15:17.912 --> 02:15:19.293]  We keep switching sides.
[02:15:19.293 --> 02:15:23.676]  We end up facing down the guns that we gave people or sold people.
[02:15:24.176 --> 02:15:24.936]  Incredible.
[02:15:24.936 --> 02:15:27.557]  All he wants to do is restore common sense to government.
[02:15:27.557 --> 02:15:28.597]  You got cut off by the break.
[02:15:28.597 --> 02:15:29.638]  I want to go to phone calls again.
[02:15:29.638 --> 02:15:30.598]  Roger Stone is our guest.
[02:15:30.598 --> 02:15:31.838]  Stonezone.com.
[02:15:31.838 --> 02:15:34.619]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com.
[02:15:34.619 --> 02:15:38.300]  The phenomenon, it's like being at the Grand Canyon, seeing what's politically happening.
[02:15:38.300 --> 02:15:39.000]  It's just epic.
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:39.721]  It's so big.
[02:15:39.721 --> 02:15:40.381]  It's so vast.
[02:15:40.381 --> 02:15:41.461]  You can't believe you're seeing it.
[02:15:41.461 --> 02:15:42.962]  It's like surreal.
[02:15:42.962 --> 02:15:46.222]  This Trump phenomenon, what's happening all over the world at the same time.
[02:15:46.222 --> 02:15:47.423]  Populism rising.
[02:15:48.423 --> 02:15:51.725]  Uh, and the bizarre behavior of the left, like cult leaders.
[02:15:51.725 --> 02:16:01.491]  It is surreal for me, and then getting back into the Bushes, how you were involved, you know, running the recount for him, involved getting Herbert Walker elected, you know, inside Nixon, inside Reagan.
[02:16:01.491 --> 02:16:11.858]  Looking back, what would Ronald Reagan, Ronald Reagan, Nixon, any of these men, who would you say was probably the most patriotic, uh, best guy, and then what do you think they would think of what's happening now?
[02:16:12.871 --> 02:16:15.294]  If Ronald Reagan were alive today, he'd be rolling in his grave.
[02:16:15.294 --> 02:16:17.376]  First of all, I think he knew that George H.W.
[02:16:17.376 --> 02:16:19.538]  Bush was the single largest mistake he ever made.
[02:16:19.538 --> 02:16:23.141]  Well, he said he's a globalist, trilateralist, and didn't want him.
[02:16:23.141 --> 02:16:24.903]  And what was his reward for picking Bush?
[02:16:24.903 --> 02:16:25.904]  They tried to kill him.
[02:16:25.904 --> 02:16:32.550]  And as I establish in my book, the many, many ties between the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan and the Bush family.
[02:16:32.930 --> 02:16:35.652]  That's got to scare them that you're such an insider saying all this.
[02:16:35.652 --> 02:16:36.894]  Well, let's say two things.
[02:16:36.894 --> 02:16:38.875]  First of all, Hinckley is not the only gunman.
[02:16:38.875 --> 02:16:41.197]  Secondarily, there's more than five shots.
[02:16:41.197 --> 02:16:47.143]  Thirdly, they've never turned over the photographs that were taken of the crime scene.
[02:16:47.143 --> 02:16:55.150]  I went and obtained the actual photographs, the uncropped photographs from presidential photographer Michael Evans.
[02:16:55.150 --> 02:16:56.451]  Look at the big picture.
[02:16:56.451 --> 02:16:57.832]  You can see the second gunman.
[02:16:58.112 --> 02:17:00.373]  You can see him on the balcony up above the door.
[02:17:00.373 --> 02:17:02.114]  You can see the gun in his hand.
[02:17:02.114 --> 02:17:03.675]  The five shots... And that's in your book.
[02:17:03.675 --> 02:17:04.256]  It's so amazing.
[02:17:04.256 --> 02:17:08.258]  The five shots that Hinckley squeezed off at Reagan are all accounted for.
[02:17:08.258 --> 02:17:09.779]  None of them hit Ronald Reagan.
[02:17:09.779 --> 02:17:13.461]  And of course, Hinckley's family is meeting the day before with the Bushes in Colorado.
[02:17:14.081 --> 02:17:16.342]  John Hinckley Sr., John Hinckley Jr.'
[02:17:16.322 --> 02:17:28.468]  's father, is not only a former CIA operative along with George W. Bush, but he's a major financier of Bush's political career in 1964, 1966, 1970, 1980.
[02:17:28.468 --> 02:17:33.211]  He's described in the papers, in the newspapers, as a Reagan supporter.
[02:17:33.211 --> 02:17:35.452]  Never gave a dime to Ronald Reagan.
[02:17:35.452 --> 02:17:36.732]  It's disinformation.
[02:17:36.732 --> 02:17:38.613]  You knew Ronald Reagan very well, and also Nixon.
[02:17:38.613 --> 02:17:39.894]  I guess you were closer to Nixon though, right?
[02:17:40.875 --> 02:17:43.256]  Nixon had a voracious interest in politics.
[02:17:43.256 --> 02:17:44.116]  I mean, he was out of office.
[02:17:44.116 --> 02:17:44.797]  He hung out with you.
[02:17:44.797 --> 02:17:46.258]  We were very close friends.
[02:17:46.258 --> 02:17:48.959]  He made a mean martini, I must tell you.
[02:17:48.959 --> 02:17:54.242]  The great thing about Nixon was he was not retrospective or introspective.
[02:17:54.242 --> 02:18:01.086]  But after he had a drink and a half, you could get him to talk about Alger Hiss, Dwight Eisenhower, Joe McCarthy.
[02:18:01.086 --> 02:18:03.167]  Believe me, he knows who killed John Kennedy.
[02:18:03.167 --> 02:18:05.969]  He's well aware that Lyndon Johnson killed John Kennedy.
[02:18:05.969 --> 02:18:07.250]  What was it that Nixon said to me?
[02:18:07.890 --> 02:18:09.512]  Lyndon and I both wanted to be president.
[02:18:09.512 --> 02:18:12.596]  He said the difference was, I wasn't willing to kill for it.
[02:18:12.596 --> 02:18:14.639]  He knows exactly who killed John Kennedy.
[02:18:14.639 --> 02:18:18.724]  Wow, and that's directly, you're well known to be very good friends with the late Richard Nixon.
[02:18:18.724 --> 02:18:26.594]  Nixon wasn't perfect, but you look at the stuff he got in trouble for, having a hundred and something names of IRS stuff, not persecuting tens of thousands openly.
[02:18:26.954 --> 02:18:28.255]  Look, he made major mistakes.
[02:18:28.255 --> 02:18:30.636]  Taking us off the gold standard, major mistake.
[02:18:30.636 --> 02:18:33.117]  The war on drugs, major mistake.
[02:18:33.117 --> 02:18:35.238]  But he did believe in American sovereignty.
[02:18:35.238 --> 02:18:36.219]  He believed in American law.
[02:18:36.219 --> 02:18:40.060]  Is that why there was an internal coup to just weaken the presidency at that time?
[02:18:40.060 --> 02:18:51.086]  Sure, because you see, the war machine, the internationalists thought that in the election of Nixon, we would be able to prolong the Vietnam War in order to make more money.
[02:18:51.086 --> 02:18:51.606]  But he ended it.
[02:18:51.886 --> 02:18:52.987]  They got a dove.
[02:18:52.987 --> 02:18:55.909]  This guy was interested in peace and prosperity.
[02:18:55.909 --> 02:19:00.593]  He was very cleverly playing the Russians and the Chinese off against each other.
[02:19:00.593 --> 02:19:01.734]  That's not what they expected.
[02:19:01.734 --> 02:19:03.255]  They expected a dupe.
[02:19:03.255 --> 02:19:05.537]  So he tried to be president, that's why they got rid of him.
[02:19:05.537 --> 02:19:07.559]  He was a peacemaker, that's why they got rid of him.
[02:19:07.559 --> 02:19:08.399]  Now, that's not to say...
[02:19:09.480 --> 02:19:11.741]  Trump, because he'd actually try to be president.
[02:19:11.741 --> 02:19:14.081]  And he believes in American sovereignty.
[02:19:14.081 --> 02:19:16.082]  He's not prepared to turn over... And that's why we're in so much trouble.
[02:19:16.082 --> 02:19:17.782]  We're going to skip this break, I can't help it.
[02:19:17.782 --> 02:19:28.845]  That's why we're in so much trouble, is that there's all these special interests who don't even have the same interests buying off chunks of everything, as you said, and so nothing seems to make sense or work, because it only works for them to get more money.
[02:19:28.845 --> 02:19:37.187]  But there won't be anywhere to spend the money if we have war with Russia, or you rob the middle class and the poor people and everything collapses, then all your money's worthless, you morons!
[02:19:38.067 --> 02:19:40.048]  A political class or a bunch of idiots?
[02:19:40.048 --> 02:19:44.109]  Wait till Trump starts talking about monetary policy because he believes in a strong dollar.
[02:19:44.109 --> 02:19:47.930]  He understands the currency manipulation going on by the Chinese.
[02:19:47.930 --> 02:19:52.251]  He would make a dollar as good as gold or some other commodity again.
[02:19:52.251 --> 02:19:53.371]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:19:53.371 --> 02:19:54.571]  He's a Wharton graduate.
[02:19:54.571 --> 02:19:57.172]  Never think he doesn't understand the global and U.S.
[02:19:57.172 --> 02:19:57.712]  economy.
[02:19:57.712 --> 02:19:58.673]  And he's living in the real world.
[02:19:58.673 --> 02:19:59.113]  Big difference.
[02:19:59.113 --> 02:20:00.293]  He had to put up with government regulation.
[02:20:00.413 --> 02:20:02.875]  Well, and he's not the toast of Wall Street, I'll tell you why.
[02:20:02.875 --> 02:20:05.797]  He made his money on bricks and mortar and land.
[02:20:05.797 --> 02:20:07.659]  He made his money in real estate.
[02:20:07.659 --> 02:20:10.181]  Tangible, hard assets.
[02:20:10.181 --> 02:20:12.042]  This is not a guy who played the stock market.
[02:20:12.042 --> 02:20:16.545]  And by the way, they put this lie out that he declared general bankruptcy.
[02:20:16.545 --> 02:20:23.291]  When I used to make a film, I'd get liability protection, I'd make a corporation, that's how you're supposed to do it, I'd put it out, and
[02:20:23.911 --> 02:20:26.772]  I never had to declare bankruptcy on that particular, but I knew folks that did.
[02:20:26.772 --> 02:20:33.333]  If it lost money, I would just roll it up as I had contracts to folks, that's what I had to do, and shut it down, and that project's bankrupt.
[02:20:33.333 --> 02:20:35.474]  That's what every film in Hollywood does.
[02:20:35.474 --> 02:20:39.555]  But see, they know the general public hasn't actually worked in a bunch of businesses.
[02:20:39.555 --> 02:20:42.236]  They don't know that Trump didn't declare general bankruptcy.
[02:20:42.236 --> 02:20:43.396]  He didn't declare that article.
[02:20:43.396 --> 02:20:47.217]  He did it specifically on projects that didn't work.
[02:20:47.217 --> 02:20:51.598]  Well, and most specifically, his casino empire, which was destroyed
[02:20:52.418 --> 02:20:55.019]  By the state of New Jersey, by government policy.
[02:20:55.019 --> 02:20:56.000]  They have no airport.
[02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:57.560]  There's no way to get there.
[02:20:57.560 --> 02:21:00.001]  Their policies destroyed his business.
[02:21:00.001 --> 02:21:02.943]  So he used a legitimate business tactic.
[02:21:02.943 --> 02:21:07.745]  He filed for Chapter 11 to protect his employees, to protect his business interests.
[02:21:07.745 --> 02:21:15.408]  But the canard that Donald Trump personally filed for bankruptcy four times, that's an establishment lie.
[02:21:15.408 --> 02:21:17.829]  Primarily gated again by Marco Rubio last night.
[02:21:17.829 --> 02:21:20.230]  It's not general bankruptcy, it's specific company.
[02:21:20.430 --> 02:21:21.351]  Yeah, you know what?
[02:21:21.351 --> 02:21:23.332]  I want a president that smart.
[02:21:23.332 --> 02:21:28.996]  I want a president who will protect the American economy the way Donald Trump protected his businesses.
[02:21:28.996 --> 02:21:32.318]  Well, the globalists admit they went cloward and pivot and they want us poor.
[02:21:32.318 --> 02:21:35.020]  Like Obama said, you can't have cars or air conditioning.
[02:21:35.020 --> 02:21:36.141]  Well, he's on a jumbo jet.
[02:21:36.141 --> 02:21:40.283]  These people are... It'd be one thing if they were living in a shack saying we've all got to be poor for the earth.
[02:21:40.283 --> 02:21:44.866]  I'm not going to put up with these pigs telling me they're these loving socialists.
[02:21:44.866 --> 02:21:46.367]  I mean, look what we've got.
[02:21:46.367 --> 02:21:46.848]  It's amazing.
[02:21:46.848 --> 02:21:49.490]  I want to go to phone calls here, but finishing up on the Bushes.
[02:21:50.450 --> 02:21:54.433]  You're saying, is the dynasty dead, or is it hanging on by its fingernails?
[02:21:54.433 --> 02:22:03.719]  Because the archetype of George Herbert Walker, the former CIA director, the guy involved in the Kennedy assassination, out there looking like he didn't know what planet he was on, I have respect for my elders.
[02:22:03.719 --> 02:22:08.422]  But at the same time, them rolling him out, was that indicative of the dying Bush dynasty?
[02:22:09.122 --> 02:22:11.385]  The Bush dynasty is far from dead.
[02:22:11.385 --> 02:22:13.827]  These people, if they are nothing else, they're relentless.
[02:22:13.827 --> 02:22:14.888]  Look at it this way.
[02:22:14.888 --> 02:22:15.889]  George H.W.
[02:22:15.889 --> 02:22:19.754]  Bush ran for Vice President in 1968, 1972, 1974, 1976, and then he finally got there in 1980.
[02:22:19.754 --> 02:22:21.395]  Now, Alex, no one runs for Vice President.
[02:22:21.395 --> 02:22:21.556]  No one.
[02:22:29.264 --> 02:22:31.006]  Other than Lyndon Johnson, why did he run?
[02:22:31.006 --> 02:22:31.867]  Because he wanted to take over.
[02:22:31.867 --> 02:22:32.548]  He had a plan.
[02:22:32.548 --> 02:22:38.935]  That's why his right-hand man, Bobby Baker, says on the day John Kennedy is inaugurated, what does he say?
[02:22:38.935 --> 02:22:42.979]  John Kennedy will not fill out his term and he will die a violent death.
[02:22:42.979 --> 02:22:46.303]  And the Bushes sat at the knee of LBJ and the CIA on the opera run right here.
[02:22:47.043 --> 02:22:54.007]  This is precisely why the Bush's maneuvered relentlessly through the 60s and 70s and 80s for the vice presidency.
[02:22:54.007 --> 02:22:58.749]  I actually know folks, you know, let's just say Johnson family, some of the folks, and it's like well known.
[02:22:58.749 --> 02:23:00.570]  Of course he was killed.
[02:23:00.570 --> 02:23:06.753]  And I know some of the big Republicans, and I've been on a plane with them before, flying in and out of Dallas, they're like, of course we killed that son of a bitch.
[02:23:06.753 --> 02:23:08.514]  I mean, they all brag about it.
[02:23:08.514 --> 02:23:13.156]  Well, as you know, the KGB conducted their own independent investigation.
[02:23:13.736 --> 02:23:18.379]  J. Edgar Hoover says to Lyndon Johnson in a memo that was declassified in 1985.
[02:23:18.379 --> 02:23:20.861]  Well, Mr. President, the Soviets did their own investigation.
[02:23:20.861 --> 02:23:22.342]  You know what they concluded?
[02:23:22.342 --> 02:23:23.222]  You did it.
[02:23:23.222 --> 02:23:24.763]  You did it, Mr. President.
[02:23:24.763 --> 02:23:28.226]  The French, they did their own investigation at the request of Jackie Kennedy.
[02:23:28.226 --> 02:23:29.507]  You know what they determined?
[02:23:29.507 --> 02:23:30.868]  Lyndon Johnson did it.
[02:23:30.868 --> 02:23:33.329]  Sure, the Central Intelligence Agency is involved.
[02:23:33.329 --> 02:23:34.510]  Sure, the mob was involved.
[02:23:34.750 --> 02:23:36.191]  Sure, Big Texas Oil was involved.
[02:23:36.191 --> 02:23:36.872]  That's who you always use.
[02:23:36.872 --> 02:23:38.473]  What's their common thread?
[02:23:38.473 --> 02:23:41.616]  Their common thread is Lyndon Baines Johnson.
[02:23:41.616 --> 02:23:42.917]  He was the mastermind.
[02:23:42.917 --> 02:23:43.478]  Absolutely.
[02:23:43.478 --> 02:23:44.419]  He was the indispensable.
[02:23:44.419 --> 02:23:46.080]  I mean, I interviewed him before she died.
[02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:49.003]  It was on his mistress.
[02:23:49.003 --> 02:23:49.663]  Yes, Madeline Ryder.
[02:23:49.663 --> 02:23:53.587]  You know, they kept him over there at the cattleman's suite over at the Driscoll.
[02:23:53.587 --> 02:23:54.007]  Yes.
[02:23:54.007 --> 02:23:55.068]  Nice place to stay, by the way.
[02:23:56.249 --> 02:24:01.393]  Boy, I tell ya, I mean, he just walked right out and said, after tomorrow, that son of a bitch will never embarrass me again.
[02:24:01.393 --> 02:24:02.593]  He said it two or twice, actually.
[02:24:02.593 --> 02:24:04.635]  He said it the night before and the following morning.
[02:24:04.635 --> 02:24:10.199]  He said, after today, those Irish Mafia sons of bitches won't be down on me anymore.
[02:24:10.199 --> 02:24:12.160]  So, there's just no question.
[02:24:12.160 --> 02:24:16.103]  Remember, in 1963 in Texas, murder's a state crime.
[02:24:16.883 --> 02:24:18.705]  Who controls the Dallas Police?
[02:24:18.705 --> 02:24:20.767]  Who controls the Dallas District Attorney?
[02:24:20.767 --> 02:24:22.209]  Who has control of the investigation?
[02:24:22.209 --> 02:24:23.970]  Well, LBJ was just an Oakland gangster.
[02:24:23.970 --> 02:24:24.971]  He was Dixie Mafia.
[02:24:24.971 --> 02:24:27.034]  Well, he was on the pad for the mob.
[02:24:27.034 --> 02:24:32.219]  He was being paid through a man named Jack Halfer, who he pardoned immediately after becoming president.
[02:24:32.219 --> 02:24:34.141]  Oh, and my grandmother knew him.
[02:24:34.141 --> 02:24:36.683]  He was a major water carrier for Big Texas Oil.
[02:24:37.324 --> 02:24:44.251]  And as far as the CIA is concerned, as the Senate Majority Leader, he has the authority to appoint himself to a committee.
[02:24:44.251 --> 02:24:47.214]  Now, the Majority Leader never serves on a committee of the U.S.
[02:24:47.214 --> 02:24:56.483]  Senate, but Johnson appointed himself to the subcommittee of the Defense Appropriations Committee that controlled the CIA budgets.
[02:24:56.483 --> 02:24:58.505]  He's the paymaster for the CIA.
[02:24:58.905 --> 02:25:01.047]  I want to go to calls, but I've got a question for you later.
[02:25:01.047 --> 02:25:09.817]  All these top generals, every special forces person I meet, including officers, they all say there's a counter-coup in the government against Obama and the globalist takedown of America.
[02:25:09.817 --> 02:25:11.339]  They're all behind Trump.
[02:25:11.339 --> 02:25:12.780]  They say he's for real.
[02:25:12.780 --> 02:25:20.369]  That's got to scare the power structure that the guys that actually do the hanging are saying they're not going to play ball with going after Trump or anybody.
[02:25:20.729 --> 02:25:22.510]  I think that's exactly true.
[02:25:22.510 --> 02:25:23.850]  Look, they're losing their control.
[02:25:23.850 --> 02:25:26.071]  That's why they're in a panic.
[02:25:26.071 --> 02:25:27.871]  That's why I'm being banned by CNN.
[02:25:27.871 --> 02:25:30.732]  That's why I'm being banned by MSNBC.
[02:25:30.732 --> 02:25:34.534]  Both laughable because they very rarely interviewed me to begin with.
[02:25:34.534 --> 02:25:36.394]  And their audiences are very small.
[02:25:36.394 --> 02:25:40.996]  And because they know that the truth is dangerous to them.
[02:25:40.996 --> 02:25:44.657]  Look, everything you need to know to defeat Hillary Clinton is in my book.
[02:25:45.017 --> 02:25:54.861]  The epic rapes by Bill, the cover-up by Hillary, the Clintons' abandoned son, their African-American son, who they threw away in the public garbage.
[02:25:54.861 --> 02:25:56.762]  And I know how they work with the Bushes.
[02:25:56.762 --> 02:26:00.904]  Both books, dubbed all together, I read them both, they're unbelievable pieces of history.
[02:26:00.904 --> 02:26:04.406]  Infowars, store.com to get those, because I'm an expert on all this stuff.
[02:26:04.406 --> 02:26:07.147]  I'd forgotten so much that was in these books, I even learned more.
[02:26:07.147 --> 02:26:08.808]  It's simply amazing.
[02:26:08.808 --> 02:26:11.369]  And I even had family down here in Texas when all of this was going on.
[02:26:11.889 --> 02:26:13.050]  Hi Alex, how are you doing?
[02:26:13.050 --> 02:26:14.210]  I appreciate your showing.
[02:26:14.210 --> 02:26:18.852]  Just a little bit of background, I'm a freelance writer and journalist reporter from the LA area.
[02:26:39.535 --> 02:26:43.258]  In 2008, I covered a story that was featured in your police state film.
[02:26:43.258 --> 02:26:47.801]  It was about the DUI checkpoint in San Bernardino that they did where the Marines were there.
[02:26:47.801 --> 02:26:50.744]  So, I just want to say, you know, I believe a lot of what you're saying.
[02:26:50.744 --> 02:26:51.464]  I really do.
[02:26:51.464 --> 02:26:56.868]  You're the journalist I had on about the Marines running the armed checkpoints in California, is that what you're saying?
[02:26:56.868 --> 02:26:57.729]  Yeah, in 2000, it was... I remember you.
[02:26:57.729 --> 02:26:58.329]  How are you doing?
[02:26:58.329 --> 02:26:59.050]  I remember your voice.
[02:26:59.050 --> 02:26:59.931]  Fine.
[02:26:59.931 --> 02:27:01.572]  Sure, so what's your question or comment for Stone?
[02:27:03.021 --> 02:27:04.503]  Well, I have a question and comment.
[02:27:04.503 --> 02:27:16.995]  First, I just want to say to Roger Stone, you know, even though I believe a lot of what you guys are saying about Trump, there's a couple things I find problematic and I really wanted to get your opinion.
[02:27:16.995 --> 02:27:23.442]  There's a lot of talk on social media and just around a lot of people that, you know, a lot of these racist groups like KKK, neo-Nazi groups, the West
[02:27:23.882 --> 02:27:24.482]  No, I agree.
[02:27:24.482 --> 02:27:25.462]  I'm just wondering...
[02:27:53.101 --> 02:27:57.142]  Will Trump ever, you know, respond to this?
[02:27:57.142 --> 02:27:58.622]  Why should he?
[02:27:58.622 --> 02:28:00.203]  It's like responding to dog crap.
[02:28:00.203 --> 02:28:01.903]  They're being used to discredit him.
[02:28:01.903 --> 02:28:02.963]  This is an old trick.
[02:28:02.963 --> 02:28:04.724]  So you saw a big story.
[02:28:04.724 --> 02:28:06.824]  David Duke endorses Donald Trump.
[02:28:06.824 --> 02:28:07.944]  Let me tell you something.
[02:28:07.944 --> 02:28:10.265]  Donald Trump doesn't endorse David Duke.
[02:28:10.265 --> 02:28:11.165]  That's a canard.
[02:28:11.165 --> 02:28:13.246]  It's an attempt to destabilize Trump.
[02:28:13.246 --> 02:28:15.366]  Donald Trump is not a racist.
[02:28:15.366 --> 02:28:19.547]  He is not a big... He's the guy that buys the famous golf courses that are white only and opens it up.
[02:28:20.047 --> 02:28:25.511]  And formed a club in Palm Beach to admit Jews because the big clubs wouldn't admit Jewish people.
[02:28:25.511 --> 02:28:26.331]  He's a rebel, folks.
[02:28:26.331 --> 02:28:27.492]  I've been studying it.
[02:28:27.492 --> 02:28:31.114]  And he has created thousands of jobs for black people.
[02:28:31.114 --> 02:28:33.236]  Thousands of jobs for Hispanics.
[02:28:33.236 --> 02:28:35.617]  Donald Trump stands for opportunity.
[02:28:35.617 --> 02:28:36.578]  He stands for prosperity.
[02:28:36.578 --> 02:28:42.001]  But I mean, listen, I haven't found a white supremacist group that's on TV that isn't run by the Feds.
[02:28:42.001 --> 02:28:46.384]  I mean, literally, I've gone out and protested them and it looks like an ADL meeting.
[02:28:46.384 --> 02:28:48.866]  I mean, if those guys are Nazis up on stage, I'm an Easter Bunny.
[02:28:49.730 --> 02:28:50.310]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:28:50.310 --> 02:28:50.991]  It's totally fake.
[02:28:50.991 --> 02:28:52.232]  It's a dirty trick, folks.
[02:28:52.232 --> 02:28:53.473]  But thanks for your question.
[02:28:53.473 --> 02:28:54.673]  And you had a comment.
[02:28:54.673 --> 02:28:56.555]  Go ahead.
[02:28:56.555 --> 02:29:10.324]  No, I mean, I was just saying, you know, I take that into account, what you're saying, but I just feel like, you know, I feel like Trump would be better if he addressed this and kind of made it public that he wasn't, because I feel like for the most part, people don't hear that from him, even though it may be true.
[02:29:10.324 --> 02:29:10.924]  No, I hear you.
[02:29:10.924 --> 02:29:11.445]  Here's the deal.
[02:29:11.445 --> 02:29:16.468]  Then there'll be more groups that come out and say, you know, then the child molester group, the Democrats will come out.
[02:29:16.468 --> 02:29:17.969]  You'll have to say, I'm not for child molesters.
[02:29:17.969 --> 02:29:18.690]  It's a tactic.
[02:29:19.190 --> 02:29:21.472]  He just needs to be confident and move forward, but I hear your point.
[02:29:21.472 --> 02:29:22.812]  Here's the bottom line, Alex.
[02:29:22.812 --> 02:29:27.095]  The power structure is literally crapping their diapers over Donald Trump.
[02:29:27.095 --> 02:29:29.197]  I hate to be gross, but that's the allegory.
[02:29:29.197 --> 02:29:31.458]  That's why they're so scared.
[02:29:31.458 --> 02:29:33.640]  And he's talking about 9-11 truth.
[02:29:33.640 --> 02:29:35.041]  Audit the Federal Reserve.
[02:29:35.041 --> 02:29:36.982]  Don't let megacorporations be tax-exempt.
[02:29:36.982 --> 02:29:38.403]  Have national sovereignty.
[02:29:38.403 --> 02:29:39.464]  Anti-globalism.
[02:29:39.464 --> 02:29:40.524]  Don't have war with Russia.
[02:29:40.524 --> 02:29:42.386]  Don't fund and run ISIS.
[02:29:42.386 --> 02:29:42.986]  On and on and on.
[02:29:42.986 --> 02:29:44.327]  Cut taxes on poor people.
[02:29:44.327 --> 02:29:46.849]  Make the hedge fund operators pay their fair share.
[02:29:46.849 --> 02:29:47.149]  Absolutely.
[02:29:47.149 --> 02:29:48.830]  We'll be back with more calls with Roger Stone.
[02:29:49.290 --> 02:29:51.834]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.834 --> 02:29:54.518]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.850 --> 02:30:06.595]  Someone on Twitter asks, Hey, if you're so against the left-right paradigm, then why do you only talk about the Republican candidates and not Bernie Sanders?
[02:30:06.595 --> 02:30:10.257]  Listen, the Sanders tax plan will destroy the middle class.
[02:30:10.257 --> 02:30:13.439]  You've got to loot the middle class because that's where the money is.
[02:30:13.439 --> 02:30:20.184]  According to the Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation, the Sanders tax plan will raise taxes on most Americans.
[02:30:20.404 --> 02:30:25.066]  It's a very big tax increase for everyone except those at the bottom.
[02:30:25.066 --> 02:30:32.950]  Everybody loves to get free stuff and politicians are always pitching the idea that the poor and middle class are going to get the benefits and the rich will pay for it.
[02:30:32.950 --> 02:30:37.632]  Americans received more than two trillion dollars in benefits from the federal government in 2014.
[02:30:37.632 --> 02:30:41.334]  Bernie wants to hike that amount exponentially.
[02:30:41.334 --> 02:30:48.277]  The question is, where's the money going to come from after the middle class and the millionaires have been looted and the mega-rich flee the country?
[02:30:48.737 --> 02:30:53.930]  To find out in detail how the Sanders tax plan will destroy the middle class, visit InfoWars.com.
[02:30:58.473 --> 02:31:04.216]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.

[02:31:40.190 --> 02:31:44.071]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[02:31:44.551 --> 02:31:44.791]  I think so.

[02:33:26.869 --> 02:33:29.991]  And we are back with Roger Stone, StoneZone.com.
[02:33:29.991 --> 02:33:33.494]  We sell both of his books at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:33:33.494 --> 02:33:37.857]  And by the way, we have 30% off Leap Year Special, running till Monday.
[02:33:37.857 --> 02:33:39.658]  We've never done a sale this big.
[02:33:39.658 --> 02:33:42.060]  And free shipping on top of 30% off.
[02:33:42.060 --> 02:33:44.442]  And that's on top of the discounts that are already there.
[02:33:44.442 --> 02:33:49.726]  We're losing money on at least 20 items in the store, but we're still doing it.
[02:33:49.726 --> 02:33:52.528]  30% off Brain Force.
[02:33:52.528 --> 02:33:54.369]  30% off Super Female Vitality.
[02:33:54.369 --> 02:33:55.270]  30% off Survival Shield X2.
[02:33:56.761 --> 02:34:01.190]  Winter Sun, Secret 12, Oxy Powder, Liver Shield.
[02:34:01.190 --> 02:34:03.555]  Biggest sale ever, only runs.
[02:34:03.555 --> 02:34:05.098]  Even during the money bomb, we did 25% off on free shipping.
[02:34:05.098 --> 02:34:05.459]  This is 30% off.
[02:34:07.900 --> 02:34:16.346]  And free shipping, the new joint formula, the lung cleanse, colloidal silver, everything, and the little profit we make helps fund the operation.
[02:34:16.346 --> 02:34:17.967]  Quite frankly, it's capitalism.
[02:34:17.967 --> 02:34:21.810]  A sale this big, we bring in less money per item, but make more overall to fund the operation.
[02:34:21.810 --> 02:34:24.772]  So it's a win-win-win for everybody.
[02:34:24.772 --> 02:34:30.636]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:34:30.636 --> 02:34:33.538]  We have the Hillary for Prison t-shirts as well.
[02:34:33.538 --> 02:34:35.320]  The last one sold out.
[02:34:35.320 --> 02:34:36.080]  That was limited edition.
[02:34:36.080 --> 02:34:36.821]  The new one is in.
[02:34:37.781 --> 02:34:42.125]  And we also just have so many other great items there at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:34:42.125 --> 02:34:51.732]  By the way, I was trying to mention all the incredibly patriotic, nationalistic, just brave things Trump's doing.
[02:34:51.732 --> 02:34:55.915]  He says, hey, if I get elected, I will prosecute Hillary Clinton.
[02:34:55.915 --> 02:34:57.696]  I mean, you talk about asking for it.
[02:34:57.696 --> 02:35:00.318]  I guess he just knows he's risking his life.
[02:35:00.318 --> 02:35:01.639]  And so he's going all out.
[02:35:01.639 --> 02:35:03.360]  I mean, get us inside Trump's mind.
[02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:04.741]  I want to go to some more calls here.
[02:35:04.741 --> 02:35:05.602]  And we have a guest popping in.
[02:35:05.822 --> 02:35:12.046]  Can you imagine any other conventional political figure, any career politician having the courage to say that?
[02:35:12.046 --> 02:35:16.348]  I mean, Hillary Clinton can be prosecuted for multiple crimes.
[02:35:16.348 --> 02:35:20.791]  There is no question, first of all, that one does not even have to prove intent.
[02:35:21.371 --> 02:35:26.294]  There can be criminal negligence in her misuse of top-secret documents.
[02:35:26.294 --> 02:35:28.116]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[02:35:28.116 --> 02:35:31.518]  There's no lack of evidence of guilt.
[02:35:31.518 --> 02:35:35.300]  And that's before you even touch the Clinton Foundation.
[02:35:35.300 --> 02:35:41.364]  Before you even touch the fact that the Clinton Foundation is a $2 billion global fraud.
[02:35:41.364 --> 02:35:46.007]  It is a vehicle for the facilitation of multi-million dollar bribes.
[02:35:46.007 --> 02:35:47.529]  And here's the best part.
[02:35:47.529 --> 02:35:49.170]  You know who's legally culpable?
[02:35:49.170 --> 02:35:51.171]  You know who signed all those fraudulent reports?
[02:35:51.851 --> 02:35:52.872]  Chelsea Clinton.
[02:35:52.872 --> 02:35:55.193]  She can warm her jail cell up too.
[02:35:55.193 --> 02:35:56.173]  Wow.
[02:35:56.173 --> 02:36:02.396]  And again, you've been the consummate insider but always promoted kind of Barry Goldwater libertarian ideas since you got in.
[02:36:02.396 --> 02:36:03.716]  I know you're a fan of Goldwater.
[02:36:03.716 --> 02:36:05.797]  You finally just broke on the system.
[02:36:05.797 --> 02:36:09.999]  When was the moment that you became such a resistor?
[02:36:09.999 --> 02:36:14.981]  I mean, just putting out the most hardcore books and material about the power structure ever.
[02:36:15.691 --> 02:36:17.492]  The Iraq War was what did it for me.
[02:36:17.492 --> 02:36:20.975]  See, until then, I didn't really understand the big picture.
[02:36:20.975 --> 02:36:29.341]  And once it became clear to me that we were rushing to war on false pretenses, I realized that the mistake of George W. Bush was an enormous mistake.
[02:36:29.341 --> 02:36:31.323]  And I had to atone for it, in some way.
[02:36:31.323 --> 02:36:36.107]  And that's when I started talking about what I'd seen and what I'd heard, and I began putting the big picture together.
[02:36:37.227 --> 02:36:42.610]  And look, I don't regret anything that I've written, and I intend to write more.
[02:36:42.610 --> 02:36:44.812]  I'm going to continue to pursue this.
[02:36:44.812 --> 02:36:57.078]  I started two years ago with the idea that we were going to be facing a Bush-Clinton choice, which is kind of a heads-I-win, tails-you-lose election, and that that had to be blunted.
[02:36:57.078 --> 02:37:03.722]  And the only guy who could do it, the only guy with the name ID and the stature and the gravitas and, frankly, the guts,
[02:37:04.182 --> 02:37:06.227]  The courage to do it with Donald Trump.
[02:37:06.227 --> 02:37:11.740]  Now, last night in the debate, a great deal was made in the fact that Trump gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation.
[02:37:14.451 --> 02:37:16.533]  In all honesty, he thought he was giving to a charity.
[02:37:16.533 --> 02:37:18.895]  He didn't know they were going to steal the money, but think about that.
[02:37:18.895 --> 02:37:19.815]  Plus, that was years ago.
[02:37:19.815 --> 02:37:20.716]  He was in New York.
[02:37:20.716 --> 02:37:21.537]  Even better.
[02:37:21.537 --> 02:37:28.743]  Therefore, he has the standing to sue them for fraud and use the lawsuit this fall to open up the entire Clinton Foundation.
[02:37:28.743 --> 02:37:29.143]  Wow.
[02:37:29.143 --> 02:37:31.305]  That's a strength, folks, not a weakness.
[02:37:31.305 --> 02:37:32.586]  He was defrauded.
[02:37:32.586 --> 02:37:34.087]  He's not happy about it.
[02:37:34.087 --> 02:37:36.329]  He thought he was helping poor children abroad.
[02:37:36.329 --> 02:37:37.930]  He didn't know that they were going to steal the money.
[02:37:37.930 --> 02:37:38.771]  He thought he was helping kids in Haiti.
[02:37:38.971 --> 02:37:46.838]  He didn't know that they were going to steal the money, so his support for the Clinton Foundation, however motivated... Well, that's one thing about Trump, though.
[02:37:46.838 --> 02:37:50.622]  He wouldn't tell people he's being audited until they brought it up, like he'd done something bad.
[02:37:50.622 --> 02:37:51.903]  He's being persecuted.
[02:37:51.903 --> 02:37:56.628]  He wouldn't bring it up, but I know it's leaked out that he gives a lot to charity, and then never talks about it.
[02:37:57.228 --> 02:38:00.992]  He has helped people, not only through charities, but individual pieces.
[02:38:00.992 --> 02:38:05.876]  Everybody knows the story about his limousine breaking down on the side of the road.
[02:38:05.876 --> 02:38:07.818]  Some folks pull over to help him.
[02:38:07.818 --> 02:38:09.279]  They help him get to the next stop.
[02:38:09.279 --> 02:38:12.522]  The next day he finds out who they are and he pays their mortgage off.
[02:38:12.522 --> 02:38:13.343]  That's Donald Trump.
[02:38:14.261 --> 02:38:16.062]  This is a guy who cares about working people.
[02:38:16.062 --> 02:38:20.246]  I'll say this, watching him on TV shows and stuff, he came off kind of as fake.
[02:38:20.246 --> 02:38:25.450]  But then when I see him with those crowds and those people, he is really responding to it.
[02:38:25.450 --> 02:38:27.712]  And really, you can tell he almost has tears in his eyes.
[02:38:27.712 --> 02:38:30.034]  So I think we're seeing a metamorphosis of Trump, too.
[02:38:30.034 --> 02:38:33.417]  You've known him for four years, but is he not accelerating his development right now?
[02:38:33.417 --> 02:38:39.542]  This is a man who has never had a cigarette, who's never had a drink, who's never touched any drugs.
[02:38:39.542 --> 02:38:41.764]  So he's Spartan in that sense.
[02:38:42.624 --> 02:38:44.385]  Wow, Donald Trump doesn't drink.
[02:38:44.385 --> 02:38:44.945]  Not a drop.
[02:38:44.945 --> 02:38:47.146]  Never had a drop in his entire life.
[02:38:47.146 --> 02:38:48.507]  Doesn't believe in it.
[02:38:48.507 --> 02:38:51.008]  Encourages children not to drink.
[02:38:51.008 --> 02:38:55.589]  He is someone who in all honesty, he doesn't enjoy the company of billionaires.
[02:38:55.589 --> 02:38:58.050]  He doesn't like hanging out with the hot shots.
[02:38:58.050 --> 02:38:58.971]  I'll tell you what he does like.
[02:38:59.491 --> 02:39:01.172]  He likes a good cheeseburger.
[02:39:01.172 --> 02:39:03.032]  He likes hanging out with working people.
[02:39:03.032 --> 02:39:04.373]  He likes regular people.
[02:39:04.373 --> 02:39:09.334]  He relates more to blue-collar workers than he does the members of his own high-class club.
[02:39:09.334 --> 02:39:13.836]  That's what folks have said, separate from his campaign, that he works in the buildings and on the sides of the stage with everybody really good.
[02:39:13.836 --> 02:39:14.816]  And he's funny.
[02:39:14.816 --> 02:39:15.716]  He's entertainment.
[02:39:15.716 --> 02:39:16.817]  He's fun to be with.
[02:39:16.817 --> 02:39:20.258]  I like the fact that he makes those risqué jokes.
[02:39:20.258 --> 02:39:20.838]  He's being real.
[02:39:21.178 --> 02:39:22.099]  You know what?
[02:39:22.099 --> 02:39:24.480]  He likes a beautiful woman.
[02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:26.021]  He likes women.
[02:39:26.021 --> 02:39:27.462]  He's a devoted family man.
[02:39:27.462 --> 02:39:28.283]  Well, that's evil nowadays.
[02:39:28.283 --> 02:39:28.483]  No, no.
[02:39:28.483 --> 02:39:29.724]  He's a devoted family man.
[02:39:29.724 --> 02:39:31.745]  His wife, by the way, is a wonderful woman.
[02:39:31.745 --> 02:39:32.826]  She did really good on TV.
[02:39:32.826 --> 02:39:33.587]  Cultured.
[02:39:33.587 --> 02:39:34.227]  Intelligent.
[02:39:34.227 --> 02:39:35.148]  Speaks five languages.
[02:39:35.148 --> 02:39:38.790]  Let's go to a couple more calls because we've got... We're going to go to your calls after Robert Perry.
[02:39:38.790 --> 02:39:40.652]  I wanted to get Robert Perry to pop in.
[02:39:40.652 --> 02:39:42.413]  He's on there with Roger Stone and Alex Jones.
[02:39:42.413 --> 02:39:45.135]  It's a total Donald Trump love fest right now and I'll tell you why.
[02:39:45.495 --> 02:39:49.196]  He's in the arena, he's doing stuff nobody's ever done, but we're about to go to him in a moment.
[02:39:49.196 --> 02:39:50.316]  First, Joe Biggs.
[02:39:50.316 --> 02:39:55.758]  Joe Biggs, one of our reporters, had a question for you before we go to Mr. Perry on the Russia situation.
[02:39:55.758 --> 02:39:57.318]  That ties into Trump as well.
[02:39:57.318 --> 02:40:03.180]  Russia reportedly threatening to use tactical nukes against Saudi Arabia or Turkey if they send in a huge ground invasion.
[02:40:03.180 --> 02:40:06.841]  Notice as soon as that came out, they've got a peace deal going, but we'll talk to Mr. Perry.
[02:40:06.841 --> 02:40:08.662]  I appreciate joining us here in just a moment.
[02:40:08.662 --> 02:40:09.802]  Joe Biggs, what's your question?
[02:40:10.435 --> 02:40:11.456]  All right, it's from Mr. Stone.
[02:40:11.456 --> 02:40:18.885]  I was kind of curious, today it's all over the news right now that Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey has come out and endorsed Donald Trump.
[02:40:18.885 --> 02:40:21.709]  Do you think this is a good thing for Donald or not?
[02:40:22.116 --> 02:40:23.557]  I actually think it is a good thing.
[02:40:23.557 --> 02:40:30.303]  I know that the Rubio people, with an assist from the Bushes, were trying desperately to get his support.
[02:40:30.303 --> 02:40:41.914]  But I would point out to you that Chris Christie is a very close friend of Mary Ann Trump Berry, who's a very distinguished federal judge, Donald's sister, one of the finest women that I have ever known.
[02:40:41.914 --> 02:40:47.119]  And the Christie endorsement of Trump is a chink.
[02:40:48.099 --> 02:40:56.223]  In the armor of the establishment, I'm glad to have his support because we're going to a convention that is going to be a vicious fight.
[02:40:56.223 --> 02:41:00.905]  This is why I'm trying to recruit the best parliamentarians, the best floor operatives.
[02:41:00.905 --> 02:41:03.666]  I've been to every Republican National Convention since 1964.
[02:41:03.666 --> 02:41:08.248]  I have worked the floor in the conventions in 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, so I know my way around the convention floor.
[02:41:13.510 --> 02:41:14.851]  They have the troops.
[02:41:14.851 --> 02:41:15.991]  They have the experts.
[02:41:15.991 --> 02:41:18.093]  That's why I've got to go to my Rolodex.
[02:41:18.093 --> 02:41:23.235]  I've got to recruit people who've been out of the system for a while, but know these rules even better than I do.
[02:41:23.235 --> 02:41:24.896]  I've got to find a place to house them.
[02:41:24.896 --> 02:41:27.918]  I'll get no cooperation from the Republican National Committee.
[02:41:27.918 --> 02:41:33.081]  There'll be no hotel rooms in Cleveland for the Trumpites, that I can assure you.
[02:41:33.081 --> 02:41:35.642]  That's why I set up StopTheSteal.org.
[02:41:35.642 --> 02:41:38.644]  I've got to raise a little bit of money to pull some of the conservative
[02:41:39.464 --> 02:41:41.025]  Activists, some of the real pioneers.
[02:41:41.025 --> 02:41:42.845]  I think you can probably recruit Buchanan.
[02:41:42.845 --> 02:41:43.805]  I have no doubt about that.
[02:41:43.805 --> 02:41:46.907]  Pat Buchanan is a friend of mine, going back to the Nixon days.
[02:41:46.907 --> 02:41:51.108]  He's a real patriot, and I have no doubt that he will be on the front lines.
[02:41:51.108 --> 02:41:52.908]  All right, good question, Beggs.
[02:41:52.908 --> 02:41:58.470]  We'll have you popping in also in the fourth hour today, and of course, Happy News Tonight 7, and I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:41:58.470 --> 02:41:58.810]  Central.
[02:41:58.810 --> 02:42:02.872]  We're going to cover your speech tomorrow at Brave New Books, and we're going to have excerpts of that Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:42:03.832 --> 02:42:08.155]  I want to go to our guest who I appreciate coming on the broadcast today.
[02:42:08.155 --> 02:42:11.797]  I want to go over several issues with him.
[02:42:11.797 --> 02:42:33.152]  Here's the article, Paul Joseph Watson wrote about it, and the report written for Consortium News, and of course Robert Parry is the editor of ConsortiumNews.com, and he has worked with Press TV, Newsweek, PBS Frontline, Bloomberg News, you name it, and he's an author and investigative journalist, and he reportedly has talked to some of the Russian insiders about
[02:42:33.792 --> 02:42:43.075]  Their strategy in Syria and how serious this has gotten with Turkey still shelling, even as Russia tries to make a peace deal with the U.S.
[02:42:43.075 --> 02:42:52.778]  brokering it, Saudi Arabia threatening to launch ground war, and Russia made this threat reportedly two days after Saudi ministers said, we now have nukes from Pakistan, we're ready to use them.
[02:42:53.078 --> 02:42:57.520]  So if the Saudis are crazy enough to start a nuclear war with Russia, somebody needs to stop them.
[02:42:57.520 --> 02:43:01.662]  But of course, Mr. Parry also helped expose Iran-Contra and a lot more.
[02:43:01.662 --> 02:43:03.702]  He's been an investigative journalist for a long time.
[02:43:03.702 --> 02:43:04.843]  Robert, thanks for coming on.
[02:43:04.843 --> 02:43:11.366]  You're on with Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign, who obviously Trump is against war with Russia and what's happening in Syria.
[02:43:11.366 --> 02:43:13.126]  So we appreciate you coming on.
[02:43:13.126 --> 02:43:15.847]  What did this Russian insider specifically tell you?
[02:43:15.847 --> 02:43:19.909]  And what's changed since a week ago with the Russians wanting a peace deal?
[02:43:19.909 --> 02:43:21.770]  Is that because they're concerned about Saudi Arabia?
[02:43:22.898 --> 02:43:23.498]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[02:43:23.498 --> 02:43:24.119]  Thanks for having me.
[02:43:24.119 --> 02:43:26.560]  It's good to hear Roger, too.
[02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:39.949]  Well, basically, this source who's close to Putin told me at this point when things were at a crisis stage, Turkey was threatening to do a full-scale invasion of Syria.
[02:43:39.949 --> 02:43:44.872]  The Saudis were also eager to go in and join them.
[02:43:44.872 --> 02:43:47.314]  And they wanted the United States to be part of this invasion.
[02:43:48.872 --> 02:43:53.734]  And the Russians have, according to the source, about 20,000 total personnel.
[02:43:53.734 --> 02:43:57.476]  Some are frontline troops and some are support people.
[02:43:57.476 --> 02:44:03.518]  And so the Russians were facing the possibility of annihilation of those people.
[02:44:03.518 --> 02:44:09.561]  And even though it's a violation somewhat of their general idea of when they would use nuclear weapons,
[02:44:10.656 --> 02:44:25.926]  I was told by the source that Putin made it clear to the Turks that if these 20,000 or so Russians were about to be annihilated, that the Russians were prepared to use tactical nuclear weapons to stop this invasion.
[02:44:25.926 --> 02:44:36.454]  Now, shortly after that, President Obama apparently was persuasive enough with the Turks and the Saudis to at least calm them down.
[02:44:36.454 --> 02:44:39.776]  He didn't flatly forbid them from invading, I was told.
[02:44:40.672 --> 02:44:51.049]  He made it clear the United States would not join them, and that really created some space for Secretary of State Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov.
[02:44:51.693 --> 02:44:58.057]  To hammer out this partial ceasefire that's supposed to go into effect tomorrow or over the weekend.
[02:44:58.057 --> 02:45:16.648]  Well, obviously you've broke a lot of big stories over the years, you've got a lot of credibility, but right after you put this out, and we have the Saudis threatening to use nukes, which is unprecedented, admitting they have them, and all this, to then see suddenly a brokerage deal happening shows just how serious, how close to midnight we've gotten
[02:45:17.368 --> 02:45:19.689]  And it shows how dangerous this situation is.
[02:45:19.689 --> 02:45:22.471]  Russia with total sanctions now on Turkey.
[02:45:22.471 --> 02:45:38.499]  And Russia, more credibility to what you're saying, because the Saudis have already said it, is remember 888 when the West basically went into Georgia, went all the way up to South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and killed all those Russian troops in that demilitarized zone at the UN base.
[02:45:39.099 --> 02:45:44.523]  The Russians came in with medium-range nukes and said we'll use them if NATO doesn't pull out, and NATO did.
[02:45:44.523 --> 02:45:45.964]  Dick Cheney blinked.
[02:45:45.964 --> 02:45:55.550]  So it shows the insane brinksmanship, and Obama to a great extent is being advised by the neocons, and these people are insane, and none of them have been in the military.
[02:45:55.550 --> 02:46:05.757]  And it's our military that continues, and I bet Colonel Schaefer on, years before Cyrus came on and said, General Dempsey told Obama three years ago, you're not sending ground troops in and we're not bombing for Al Qaeda.
[02:46:05.757 --> 02:46:07.198]  So again, there's this, not mutiny,
[02:46:07.998 --> 02:46:09.899]  Because we have a globalist mutiny over America.
[02:46:09.899 --> 02:46:12.719]  We have the military, never before in U.S.
[02:46:12.719 --> 02:46:15.320]  history at this level, actually holding back the neocons.
[02:46:15.320 --> 02:46:18.661]  I want you to comment on that, Robert Parry of consortiumnews.com.
[02:46:18.661 --> 02:46:21.222]  But first, Mr. Stone, your take on what I just said.
[02:46:21.222 --> 02:46:29.445]  Well, first of all, let me say, I follow Robert's career for many years, and I'm a big fan of the incredibly seminal work you did on Iran-Contra.
[02:46:29.445 --> 02:46:30.345]  Really, first rate.
[02:46:31.426 --> 02:46:32.767]  I'm delighted to be with you today.
[02:46:46.585 --> 02:46:49.326]  Only responsibility would be to the American people.
[02:46:49.326 --> 02:46:50.426]  And who doesn't want nuclear war?
[02:46:50.426 --> 02:46:52.607]  And who does not want nuclear war.
[02:46:52.607 --> 02:46:56.589]  Even last night, his comments about the Middle East shows that he is dedicated to peace.
[02:46:56.589 --> 02:47:02.771]  Donald Trump understands that the only people who benefit from war are the munitions manufacturers.
[02:47:02.771 --> 02:47:04.992]  And the munitions are too big now.
[02:47:04.992 --> 02:47:06.012]  We have to stop that business.
[02:47:06.432 --> 02:47:18.180]  The political class is petrified about an American president who puts America first, and whose fundamental principle of foreign policy would be simple.
[02:47:18.180 --> 02:47:21.382]  Is it in the interests of the United States?
[02:47:21.382 --> 02:47:21.822]  Absolutely.
[02:47:21.822 --> 02:47:23.043]  Mr. Pari?
[02:47:23.043 --> 02:47:27.966]  In that sense, as Roger points out, Trump is really sort of a realist, and realists have become
[02:47:29.751 --> 02:47:40.972]  ...of an endangered species in Washington where the neoconservatives and the liberal interventionist sidekicks that they have have essentially taken over the establishment on foreign policy.
[02:47:41.873 --> 02:47:47.795]  And so the old realists, who did exactly as Roger said, they always weighed American interests against getting involved.
[02:47:47.795 --> 02:47:54.898]  This goes back really to the beginning of the country, when Washington and Adams and Jefferson said, you know, avoid foreign entanglements.
[02:47:54.898 --> 02:47:55.938]  That's right.
[02:47:55.938 --> 02:48:01.180]  And John Quincy Adams said, it's not our job to go search the world for monsters.
[02:48:01.180 --> 02:48:02.760]  That's sort of been lost.
[02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:04.021]  Yeah, we now do the opposite of that.
[02:48:04.021 --> 02:48:04.981]  That's all we do.
[02:48:04.981 --> 02:48:06.021]  Yeah, and make no mistake.
[02:48:06.021 --> 02:48:07.242]  We demonize people.
[02:48:07.242 --> 02:48:07.942]  And make no mistake.
[02:48:07.942 --> 02:48:09.383]  I think, to pick up on Roger's point,
[02:48:11.055 --> 02:48:17.719]  There is now an hysteria going on, if you read the Washington Post, which is now dominated by neoconservative writers.
[02:48:17.719 --> 02:48:22.862]  Their op-ed pages, their editorial page and op-ed pages are pretty heavily neoconservative.
[02:48:22.862 --> 02:48:26.424]  There are a few token liberals here or there, but mostly neoconservatives.
[02:48:26.424 --> 02:48:29.986]  And so you have this hysteria going on that, what will Trump do?
[02:48:29.986 --> 02:48:36.430]  And I think they are afraid that he will shatter the establishment as we've seen it for a number of years now.
[02:48:37.182 --> 02:48:43.306]  And possibly bring back some of this more practical, pragmatic thinking about American foreign policy.
[02:48:43.306 --> 02:48:47.409]  And that really scares a lot of libertarians, a lot of real liberals, a lot of professors.
[02:48:47.409 --> 02:48:49.350]  Even Cud Pink is lightening him now.
[02:48:49.350 --> 02:48:51.292]  Because who wants a nuclear war?
[02:48:51.292 --> 02:48:51.892]  Rogers?
[02:48:51.892 --> 02:48:53.533]  No, you make a very good point.
[02:48:53.533 --> 02:48:58.897]  Look, the Washington Post is literally the single worst newspaper in the United States.
[02:48:58.897 --> 02:49:02.539]  The infiltration of the Washington Post by the Central Intelligence Agency goes back to the 60s.
[02:49:05.621 --> 02:49:16.091]  I have a 5,000-word monograph coming shortly on Bob Woodward, which completely exposes him as the fraud and the liar that he is.
[02:49:16.091 --> 02:49:19.674]  You'll be able to buy that at Amazon.com in about two weeks.
[02:49:19.674 --> 02:49:25.199]  I put a lot of work into this, but people need to realize that nothing Bob Woodward reports is the truth.
[02:49:25.199 --> 02:49:25.920]  Total operatives.
[02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:27.041]  Literally nothing.
[02:49:27.501 --> 02:49:29.282]  Who commands him today, though?
[02:49:29.282 --> 02:49:35.366]  We know it was Naval Intelligence and CIA to take down Nixon because they wanted to cover up the Kennedy thing.
[02:49:35.366 --> 02:49:36.547]  Who runs it now?
[02:49:36.547 --> 02:49:39.269]  I think today he does it for the money, to be all honesty.
[02:49:39.269 --> 02:49:41.250]  I think he's in it for the money.
[02:49:41.250 --> 02:49:48.555]  But this guy has a very, very tenuous relationship with the truth and he needs to be completely unmasked.
[02:49:48.555 --> 02:49:56.901]  This is a guy who claimed that he snuck into Bill Casey's hotel room and then Bill Casey, the former CIA director, confessed everything about Iran-Contra.
[02:49:57.581 --> 02:49:58.722]  I knew Bill Casey.
[02:49:58.722 --> 02:50:00.224]  I know his wife, Bernadette.
[02:50:00.224 --> 02:50:01.045]  I know his children.
[02:50:01.045 --> 02:50:01.686]  I know his daughter.
[02:50:01.686 --> 02:50:05.169]  At that point, Bill Casey could no longer speak.
[02:50:05.169 --> 02:50:06.290]  It's a lie.
[02:50:06.290 --> 02:50:07.812]  It's a complete lie.
[02:50:09.884 --> 02:50:10.605]  Wow.
[02:50:10.605 --> 02:50:13.126]  I tell you, this is just epic radio today.
[02:50:13.126 --> 02:50:16.388]  Mr. Papari, I want to apologize to you today that I kind of cut your time short.
[02:50:16.388 --> 02:50:18.690]  I really appreciate you joining us.
[02:50:18.690 --> 02:50:22.372]  Can I get you back on for a full 30 minutes or an hour next week?
[02:50:22.372 --> 02:50:22.932]  Sure, Alex.
[02:50:22.932 --> 02:50:23.853]  I'll be around.
[02:50:23.853 --> 02:50:25.974]  Well, you just do a great job at Consortium News.
[02:50:25.974 --> 02:50:27.075]  Everybody needs to visit it.
[02:50:27.075 --> 02:50:27.955]  ConsortiumNews.com.
[02:50:27.955 --> 02:50:32.798]  I'm going to put you on the phone with Nico and set you up for a full 30 minutes or hour, whatever you'd like to do next week.
[02:50:32.798 --> 02:50:33.559]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:50:34.349 --> 02:50:35.210]  Thank you.
[02:50:35.210 --> 02:50:36.451]  Yeah, he breaks really big news.
[02:50:36.451 --> 02:50:39.474]  And of course, thank God we didn't have nuclear war last week.
[02:50:39.474 --> 02:50:43.278]  But it's just, these neocons will kill us all if we let them continue to control things.
[02:50:43.278 --> 02:50:45.140]  And they run the Democrats as well, to a great extent.
[02:50:45.140 --> 02:50:47.082]  We're gonna come back with two segments of Roger Stone.
[02:50:47.082 --> 02:50:48.663]  And I promise, go to your phone calls.
[02:50:48.663 --> 02:50:49.865]  Sean, you're up next.
[02:50:49.865 --> 02:50:51.927]  Doug, Kristen, Chris, Tommy, stay with us.
[02:50:59.981 --> 02:51:03.684]  I'm just a sweet old lady who needs help crossing the street.
[02:51:03.684 --> 02:51:09.127]  But the real reason I want to get to the other side is so I can steal your identity along the way.
[02:51:09.127 --> 02:51:15.832]  While you're holding onto my hand, the RFID reader in my purse is capturing all your personal information.

[02:51:20.094 --> 02:51:22.856]  Oh, you have an RFID chipped subway pass?
[02:51:22.856 --> 02:51:24.257]  Well now, so do I!
[02:51:25.738 --> 02:51:30.602]  Protect yourself from crimes you can't see with ID Stronghold wallets, card sleeves, and purses.

[02:51:39.290 --> 02:51:44.174]  ID Stronghold wallets even cost about the same as wallets in most stores, but give you extra protection.
[02:51:44.174 --> 02:51:48.517]  Visit idstronghold.com and get the original RFID blocking wallet.
[02:51:48.517 --> 02:51:50.779]  I'm Walt Augustinowicz, founder and CEO.

[02:53:35.311 --> 02:53:45.476]  His name is Harry Dent, and in his newly released book, he is making even bigger and bolder predictions that have the potential to devastate the world economy and your personal wealth.

[02:54:04.345 --> 02:54:05.065]  Please repeat that.
[02:54:05.065 --> 02:54:06.546]  Roger Stone's our guest.
[02:54:06.546 --> 02:54:08.167]  David Knight's coming up.
[02:54:08.167 --> 02:54:11.848]  I don't want to exhaust this guy, but I may take him right into the third hour with David Knight.
[02:54:11.848 --> 02:54:12.989]  So David's got some questions.
[02:54:12.989 --> 02:54:18.691]  We'll have you out here about 15 after and we can eat that good German Texas barbecue we got back there waiting right now.
[02:54:18.691 --> 02:54:23.433]  German recipes, but cooked over there at Vicks by great Mexican folks.
[02:54:23.433 --> 02:54:27.015]  It is about as good as it gets, so I'm going to be, there's a plug for Vicks.
[02:54:27.015 --> 02:54:31.176]  But we're going to be going 15 minutes to the next hour, and I want to go to your calls.
[02:54:31.176 --> 02:54:32.157]  I appreciate you holding.
[02:54:32.557 --> 02:54:44.705]  You were making a wonderful, wonderful point of hypocrisy when I was talking about how we have the number one story on the internet according to Google Analytics for a day with the New York Times writer calls for assassination of Trump.
[02:54:44.705 --> 02:54:46.826]  And then you pointed out something about that guy I forgot about.
[02:54:46.826 --> 02:54:51.830]  Well, there's this fellow named Wilson who is a faux political consultant out of Tallahassee, Florida.
[02:54:52.310 --> 02:54:57.496]  This guy goes on Twitter and he calls for someone to put a bullet in Donald Trump.
[02:54:57.496 --> 02:55:04.904]  He also accuses, on Twitter, he accuses my friend Ann Coulter of having anal sex with Donald Trump.
[02:55:04.904 --> 02:55:06.566]  He's still on CNN.
[02:55:06.566 --> 02:55:12.232]  But I've been banned because what I said about Anna Navarro... As dumb as dog poo.
[02:55:12.232 --> 02:55:12.493]  Dumber.
[02:55:13.033 --> 02:55:13.973]  Uh, is offensive.
[02:55:13.973 --> 02:55:14.694]  That's offensive.
[02:55:14.694 --> 02:55:16.694]  Just close to show you the double standard there.
[02:55:16.694 --> 02:55:19.075]  CNN had three guests on there.
[02:55:19.075 --> 02:55:25.817]  Buzz Bissinger, Piers Morgan, and the ambassador's daughter, whatever that girl's name is, saying, let's kill Alex.
[02:55:25.817 --> 02:55:26.897]  Let's dress up in uniforms.
[02:55:26.897 --> 02:55:28.298]  He needs to be murdered.
[02:55:28.298 --> 02:55:29.638]  Let's kill him.
[02:55:29.638 --> 02:55:30.859]  And it's all cute and funny.
[02:55:30.859 --> 02:55:31.619]  What is their problem?
[02:55:31.619 --> 02:55:32.999]  If I said that, I'd be arrested.
[02:55:32.999 --> 02:55:35.260]  This is Soviet-style censorship.
[02:55:35.260 --> 02:55:36.900]  They fear what we know.
[02:55:36.900 --> 02:55:38.801]  They fear what we have to say.
[02:55:38.801 --> 02:55:41.742]  They fear the fact that they can no longer
[02:55:42.362 --> 02:55:43.062]  We're good to go.
[02:56:04.452 --> 02:56:06.114]  And now, and now, Vicente Fox.
[02:56:06.114 --> 02:56:20.426]  To a massive victory, and then Vicente Fox, he and his brother have been heavily involved in the drug trade, but I want to thank him also, because all they're helping do is make Americans realize that only Trump, the guy they're visioning... That we're run by a bunch of foreigners, that we're chumps!
[02:56:20.426 --> 02:56:21.026]  Yep.
[02:56:21.026 --> 02:56:23.869]  We're being colonialized by every crook and scumbag out there.
[02:56:23.869 --> 02:56:24.209]  Yep.
[02:56:24.209 --> 02:56:24.749]  Well said.
[02:56:24.749 --> 02:56:25.630]  Wow.
[02:56:25.630 --> 02:56:27.071]  Let's go to Sean in Florida.
[02:56:27.071 --> 02:56:28.432]  You're on the air along the same line.
[02:56:28.432 --> 02:56:28.713]  Go ahead.
[02:56:31.039 --> 02:56:31.720]  Hey guys, how you doing?
[02:56:31.720 --> 02:56:38.805]  I'm actually calling from Clearwater, Florida, right where the, uh, right where the guys were trained at PIE Airport while on Rubio's watch.
[02:56:38.805 --> 02:56:47.031]  But, um, you know, I was kind of assessing the same thing and thinking to myself, why would Rubio be running for second place, obviously, to get to a broker convention?
[02:56:47.031 --> 02:56:55.577]  But my understanding, the three options that they have at a broker convention, all three of those will lead to probably civil revolution.
[02:56:55.577 --> 02:56:58.279]  So I'm wondering, do you guys think that
[02:56:58.956 --> 02:57:01.559]  Somebody would actually take a chance to off him.
[02:57:01.559 --> 02:57:03.541]  I know that they've kind of heightened.
[02:57:03.541 --> 02:57:08.767]  I guarantee you the Clinton Club and others are sitting around right now.
[02:57:08.767 --> 02:57:10.469]  By the way, Trump came out and questioned Scalia.
[02:57:10.469 --> 02:57:12.251]  Now he learns the secret society.
[02:57:12.251 --> 02:57:13.813]  I guarantee you they are.
[02:57:13.813 --> 02:57:15.415]  They are thinking about how to get away with it.
[02:57:15.415 --> 02:57:15.895]  Mr. Stone.
[02:57:16.556 --> 02:57:20.477]  Well, you know, I've been encouraged not to talk about Trump's security.
[02:57:20.477 --> 02:57:22.657]  He has very, very good people around him.
[02:57:22.657 --> 02:57:26.798]  Believe me, he doesn't completely trust just this protection of the Secret Service.
[02:57:26.798 --> 02:57:30.219]  He has his own security detail and they're the very best.
[02:57:30.219 --> 02:57:31.739]  But Trump is a courageous man.
[02:57:31.739 --> 02:57:32.559]  He's a bold guy.
[02:57:32.559 --> 02:57:34.020]  He knows that this is dangerous.
[02:57:34.020 --> 02:57:35.960]  He knows he's taking his life in his hands.
[02:57:35.960 --> 02:57:36.980]  He loves his country.
[02:57:36.980 --> 02:57:39.261]  He's ready to do something about it.
[02:57:39.261 --> 02:57:40.541]  Here, of course, is the real point.
[02:57:41.201 --> 02:57:58.744]  If they wrenched the nomination from Trump through some phony, brokered convention, and they managed to deliver the nomination to a Marco Rubio, who really is just carrying the Bush agenda in a more attractive package, or they delivered it to Mitt Romney, of course they would destroy the value of the Republican nomination.
[02:57:58.744 --> 02:58:09.086]  Of course they would lose the general election, but that's perfectly alright with them because the Republican establishment would be more comfortable with a Hillary Clinton presidency than they would be with a Donald Trump presidency.
[02:58:09.086 --> 02:58:10.346]  That's why we've heard that from Glenn Beck.
[02:58:10.806 --> 02:58:17.356]  That mental patient, I'm sorry, but we've heard it from Glenn Beck, we've heard it from Karl Rove, we've heard it from all of them that Hillary's better.
[02:58:17.356 --> 02:58:18.718]  These people are traitors!
[02:58:18.718 --> 02:58:19.700]  There's no question about it.
[02:58:20.896 --> 02:58:21.717]  By the way, what's wrong?
[02:58:21.717 --> 02:58:23.858]  I don't want to bash him, but what is wrong with Glenn Beck?
[02:58:23.858 --> 02:58:26.980]  I mean, he literally sounds like a Froot Loop these days.
[02:58:26.980 --> 02:58:31.524]  He seems to be in the enthrall of Ted Cruz, and Ted Cruz is, of course, a globalist.
[02:58:31.524 --> 02:58:33.645]  His wife's a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:58:33.645 --> 02:58:34.426]  Stay there, sir.
[02:58:34.426 --> 02:58:38.689]  Back in 70 seconds with Doug, Kristen, Chris, Tommy, and others.
[02:58:38.689 --> 02:58:40.650]  I'm just going to keep this guy on here as long as I can.
[02:58:40.650 --> 02:58:42.932]  David Knight's coming up out of the other studio in the fourth hour.
[02:58:42.932 --> 02:58:44.673]  We're going to let David get a few questions in.
[02:58:44.673 --> 02:58:45.074]  Stay with us.
[02:58:47.005 --> 02:58:48.627]  Stonezone.com, by the way.

[02:59:44.924 --> 02:59:47.106]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:08.235 --> 03:00:14.524]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.203 --> 03:00:24.344]  Alright, we got a load of phone lines here.
[03:00:24.344 --> 03:00:26.405]  I'm just going to folks in the order of how long they've been holding.
[03:00:26.405 --> 03:00:31.529]  We'll go to Tommy, then we'll go to Doug, and then Christian, Chris and Cindy.
[03:00:31.529 --> 03:00:34.291]  David Knight's coming up here with us in the next segment.
[03:00:34.291 --> 03:00:36.673]  I'll ride shotgun until that segment ends and we turn it over to him.
[03:00:36.673 --> 03:00:39.294]  And then we'll be Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[03:00:39.294 --> 03:00:41.136]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tommy.
[03:00:41.136 --> 03:00:44.838]  Tommy in New York City, or New York, somewhere in New York State.
[03:00:44.838 --> 03:00:45.579]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[03:00:46.633 --> 03:00:47.474]  Yeah, New York.
[03:00:47.474 --> 03:00:48.854]  How you doing today, Alex?
[03:00:48.854 --> 03:00:53.397]  I just wanted to tell you, you and your crew are smashing things here the past few weeks.
[03:00:53.397 --> 03:00:56.158]  And to Roger Stone, thank God you are who you are.
[03:00:56.158 --> 03:01:02.081]  I had one question and two really, really vital suggestions as far as starting with the campaign.
[03:01:02.081 --> 03:01:02.982]  Sure.
[03:01:02.982 --> 03:01:05.283]  The question for Mr. Stone is this.
[03:01:05.283 --> 03:01:11.987]  When are we going to see a full unveiling as what would help appease the Cheshire Staff Sergeant Biggs?
[03:01:12.691 --> 03:01:19.639]  When are we going to actually see the unveiling of Trump's financial plan for the economy, since it is the number one issue regarding national security?
[03:01:19.639 --> 03:01:26.787]  And I mean, we as the people, I mean, that's what we're starving to hear right now, is how we're going to... Sure, he's put out some of the plan, he knows they're going to attack it, but...
[03:01:27.988 --> 03:01:32.450]  Biggs kept saying, Trump, Trump, Trump, doesn't need a wall, we need a plan.
[03:01:32.450 --> 03:01:34.791]  And I get that, I think we've seen more of a plan now.
[03:01:34.791 --> 03:01:39.112]  Go after the establishment, you know, don't let them have one-sided trade deals, that right there.
[03:01:39.112 --> 03:01:40.993]  Cut taxes, that's a huge plan.
[03:01:40.993 --> 03:01:48.876]  Kennedy cut taxes by 50% in one of the major areas, 30% in another, and the receipts into the government almost doubled.
[03:01:48.876 --> 03:01:52.297]  So the system knows cutting taxes brings in money, they just want to control everything.
[03:01:52.857 --> 03:01:53.998]  What is Trump's plan overall?
[03:02:12.034 --> 03:02:13.416]  Below that of China.
[03:02:13.416 --> 03:02:16.981]  So China, our current corporate tax rate is 35.
[03:02:16.981 --> 03:02:18.603]  China is 25.
[03:02:18.603 --> 03:02:21.006]  Cut America's rate to 15.
[03:02:21.006 --> 03:02:23.109]  And that makes the money come back?
[03:02:23.109 --> 03:02:23.850]  Overnight.
[03:02:23.850 --> 03:02:27.595]  All those giant companies doing business in China because it's more profitable.
[03:02:27.595 --> 03:02:29.738]  And the globalists wrote that to ship our jobs overseas.
[03:02:29.898 --> 03:02:37.104]  So they come back to the United States, they bring jobs back with them, they expand here, they hire here, they create opportunity here.
[03:02:37.104 --> 03:02:39.787]  Secondarily, the whole question of inversion.
[03:02:39.787 --> 03:02:45.372]  There's $2 trillion offshore that's avoiding taxation.
[03:02:46.733 --> 03:02:48.394]  That money back into the country?
[03:02:48.394 --> 03:02:50.734]  At DonaldJTrump.com, we're showing it, it's all there.
[03:02:50.734 --> 03:02:52.375]  They keep saying there's no plan, there really is a plan.
[03:02:52.375 --> 03:02:54.015]  There's an extraordinary plan.
[03:02:54.015 --> 03:02:55.436]  And then, step three.
[03:02:55.436 --> 03:03:03.438]  Trump understands that currently, in the federal bank accounts, there is one trillion dollars that is unaccounted for.
[03:03:03.438 --> 03:03:13.121]  Now, every administration prior to Obama has swept those funds into the general, to be used, instead of going for higher taxes.
[03:03:13.121 --> 03:03:14.441]  Yet those funds sit there.
[03:03:14.961 --> 03:03:20.405]  Senator Coburn, the former senator from Oklahoma, great patriot, has talked and written about this at length.
[03:03:20.405 --> 03:03:33.235]  Trump would go sweep that trillion dollars back into the national economy, back into the federal coffers, so instead of raising taxes on working people, we can use money that's already on hand and unbudgeted for.
[03:03:33.235 --> 03:03:38.039]  Trump has a very dynamic plan that would make this economy cook.
[03:03:38.379 --> 03:03:39.340]  You know what I told him?
[03:03:39.340 --> 03:03:41.901]  They're going to call it the Trump Boom.
[03:03:41.901 --> 03:03:48.725]  The biggest expansion in American economic history under a guy who's a Wharton graduate who understands the world economy.
[03:03:50.854 --> 03:04:01.540]  Roger, is that they're going to let him get in, they're holding the economy up, it implodes, then they claim like smooth haulings that protectionism caused the new depression, when the new depression's already here, that's my big concern.
[03:04:01.540 --> 03:04:04.862]  I'm not sure that Trump would ever really enact the tariffs.
[03:04:04.862 --> 03:04:09.165]  I think he's using it as a big old stick against our economic adversaries.
[03:04:09.165 --> 03:04:15.369]  He understands cutting the corporate tax rate will flummox China like no tariff could ever do.
[03:04:15.369 --> 03:04:18.951]  Well sure, that's a form of tariff, but our elites put that in with deals with China.
[03:04:19.431 --> 03:04:21.332]  People think of tariffs as a classic tariff.
[03:04:21.332 --> 03:04:26.274]  China having no environmental protection, when we have all this environmental protection, makes it impossible to do business here.
[03:04:26.274 --> 03:04:26.794]  Exactly.
[03:04:26.794 --> 03:04:30.656]  So you say we don't take your goods until you put environmental protection on.
[03:04:30.656 --> 03:04:31.697]  There's all sorts of games.
[03:04:31.697 --> 03:04:40.121]  And Trump understands that the key to rebuilding our national defense, the key to rebuilding our military, the key to a strong foreign policy, is economic strength.
[03:04:40.121 --> 03:04:41.101]  First and foremost.
[03:04:41.101 --> 03:04:44.363]  Plus you don't let them buy billion dollar fighters, you buy the fighters that actually work.
[03:04:45.103 --> 03:04:48.406]  So, look, I think only Trump understands how to make America a better country.
[03:04:48.406 --> 03:04:49.367]  Great call, great call.
[03:04:49.367 --> 03:04:52.590]  We're going to go to Doug, Kristen, Cindy, and Chris.
[03:04:52.590 --> 03:04:53.450]  And that's it for calls.
[03:04:53.450 --> 03:04:55.913]  We've got David Knight coming up from the Situation Room.
[03:04:55.913 --> 03:04:57.214]  I'm Alex Jones in the War Room.
[03:04:59.710 --> 03:05:06.457]  Someone on Twitter asks, hey, if you're so against the left-right paradigm, then why do you only talk about the Republican candidates and not Bernie Sanders?
[03:05:06.457 --> 03:05:10.140]  Listen, the Sanders tax plan will destroy the middle class.
[03:05:10.140 --> 03:05:13.303]  You've got to loot the middle class because that's where the money is.
[03:05:13.303 --> 03:05:20.290]  According to the Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation, the Sanders tax plan will raise taxes on most Americans.
[03:05:20.290 --> 03:05:24.514]  It's a very big tax increase for everyone, except those at the bottom.
[03:05:24.934 --> 03:05:32.819]  Everybody loves to get free stuff, and politicians are always pitching the idea that the poor and middle class are going to get the benefits and the rich will pay for it.
[03:05:32.819 --> 03:05:37.501]  Americans received more than $2 trillion in benefits from the federal government in 2014.
[03:05:37.501 --> 03:05:41.203]  Bernie wants to hike that amount exponentially.
[03:05:41.203 --> 03:05:48.608]  The question is, where's the money going to come from after the middle class and the millionaires have been looted and the mega-rich flee the country?
[03:05:48.608 --> 03:05:54.071]  To find out in detail how the Sanders tax plan will destroy the middle class, visit InfoWars.com.

[03:08:13.698 --> 03:08:15.540]  We are on the march.
[03:08:15.540 --> 03:08:18.703]  The empire is on the run.
[03:08:18.703 --> 03:08:23.848]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:23.848 --> 03:08:29.233]  You know, it's easy to sit on the sidelines and go along with all the media hype and bash Donald Trump all day.
[03:08:29.233 --> 03:08:29.453]  And I...
[03:08:30.985 --> 03:08:34.286]  Didn't really start even doing research on him until about a year ago.
[03:08:34.286 --> 03:08:40.929]  But all the actions he's taken are causing irrevocable damage to the criminal power structure that's hijacked our country.
[03:08:40.929 --> 03:08:43.490]  And so I'm not gonna back him with half measures.
[03:08:43.490 --> 03:08:47.771]  If he does bad things down the road and screws people over, I'm gonna come out against him.
[03:08:47.771 --> 03:08:49.292]  But I know the other people are bad.
[03:08:50.390 --> 03:08:54.293]  And I know they want to control reality, and they want to make myself and my family poor to control me.
[03:08:54.293 --> 03:08:55.234]  I'm done.
[03:08:55.234 --> 03:09:06.164]  Roger Stone, consummate Trump insider, Republican insider, in the last decade has been exposing their whole system, the Kennedy assassination of 9-11, and influencing Trump, obviously, in a big way.
[03:09:06.164 --> 03:09:07.785]  He doesn't like to brag, and says Trump's his own man.
[03:09:07.785 --> 03:09:15.912]  He is, obviously, but Stone's one of his major confidants, and of course was good personal friends with Richard Nixon, and worked with him, and he's here
[03:09:16.773 --> 03:09:17.594]  Exposing the whole deal.
[03:09:17.594 --> 03:09:19.135]  He's part of the whole Florida recount.
[03:09:19.135 --> 03:09:22.718]  He's the big insider and he's going up against him because he's all in now.
[03:09:22.718 --> 03:09:27.462]  Because the globalists want to break this country and make us a corrupt, vassal state.
[03:09:27.462 --> 03:09:30.945]  I want to take a few more calls and get some questions from David Knight and hand the baton to him.
[03:09:31.946 --> 03:09:35.388]  And then tomorrow, he's going to be speaking at Brave New Books in downtown Austin, 7 to 9.
[03:09:35.388 --> 03:09:39.911]  We're going to cover the speech and broadcast it on Sunday.
[03:09:39.911 --> 03:09:41.292]  So look for that, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:09:41.292 --> 03:09:45.414]  Central Standard Time, because this is a big deal what's happening.
[03:09:45.414 --> 03:09:58.102]  And a lot of people from the inside as well are moving this year against the establishment, because they know the establishment is actually hijackers that want to break the country forever, because they're threatened that America might actually try to resurrect itself.
[03:09:58.102 --> 03:10:00.303]  America must fall for globalism.
[03:10:00.703 --> 03:10:02.245]  To take hold.
[03:10:02.245 --> 03:10:05.248]  Briefly, we are running the biggest show we've ever run.
[03:10:05.248 --> 03:10:14.537]  On his books, that are at InfoWarshore.com, on the water filters, the non-GMO seeds, on all the nutraceuticals, Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, Super Female Vitality.
[03:10:15.632 --> 03:10:28.579]  Liver Shield, the Oxy Powder, all 17 of our products at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLive.com or call 888-253-3139 and your purchase funds our operations.
[03:10:28.579 --> 03:10:31.660]  This is a once every four years leap year sale.
[03:10:31.660 --> 03:10:35.242]  It's the biggest sale we've ever done, period.
[03:10:35.242 --> 03:10:35.862]  I didn't hype it.
[03:10:35.862 --> 03:10:37.203]  I didn't promote it beforehand.
[03:10:37.203 --> 03:10:39.064]  It snuck up on me because I'm so busy.
[03:10:39.064 --> 03:10:42.606]  Here it is and we're running it until Monday night and then that's all folks.
[03:10:43.526 --> 03:10:49.050]  As they say there on Looney Tunes, infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:10:49.050 --> 03:10:53.413]  And the money we do make from this helps fund the operation.
[03:10:53.413 --> 03:10:58.117]  Alex, I've got to say, I'm a big fan of one of your products and I want to mention it, Liver Shield.
[03:10:58.117 --> 03:11:08.965]  When I've been on the road doing, you know, what I do, the book signings, the speeches, the interviews, and I get off the road and I'm tired, I'm exhausted, I've been eating bad, I've been not getting much sleep, I hit Liver Shield.
[03:11:09.525 --> 03:11:10.787]  It's rejuvenating.
[03:11:10.787 --> 03:11:11.868]  I get mental clarity.
[03:11:11.868 --> 03:11:13.570]  I get better physical energy.
[03:11:13.570 --> 03:11:14.712]  It's a great product.
[03:11:14.712 --> 03:11:19.458]  I'm a big believer in homeopathic medicine, so I had to put in the plug.
[03:11:19.458 --> 03:11:20.459]  I'm a believer.
[03:11:20.459 --> 03:11:23.343]  Well, it's concentrated herbs that are known to help your liver detox.
[03:11:23.343 --> 03:11:26.146]  You can just take it every day, or take it once a week, or take it...
[03:11:26.747 --> 03:11:27.928]  Do the gallbladder cleanse.
[03:11:27.928 --> 03:11:28.969]  It's unbelievable.
[03:11:28.969 --> 03:11:38.336]  It takes six days, and you take the oxy powder with it, and boy, on the seventh day, it is spectacular for almost everybody.
[03:11:38.336 --> 03:11:46.362]  People can read the reviews, see the informational videos, and I think the folks over at Media Matters and places should do it for themselves, but they won't actually pop if they did.
[03:11:46.362 --> 03:11:48.063]  And same thing with that lady over there on CNN.
[03:11:48.063 --> 03:11:51.526]  I've been a little bit sarcastic here, but I do want to go back to your phone calls.
[03:11:51.526 --> 03:11:52.166]  Thanks for the plug.
[03:11:52.166 --> 03:11:53.827]  I didn't know you were a user of our products.
[03:11:53.827 --> 03:11:54.168]  Thank you, sir.
[03:11:54.588 --> 03:11:55.249]  Well, they're high quality.
[03:11:55.249 --> 03:11:57.170]  They're the highest quality we can actually bring folks.
[03:11:57.170 --> 03:12:05.217]  Plus, we know we're a target of the FDA, a target of the media, a target of the testers, and we want it to be high quality, but we have to be at the highest standard out there.
[03:12:05.217 --> 03:12:06.498]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:12:06.498 --> 03:12:07.299]  Take advantage of that.
[03:12:07.299 --> 03:12:09.441]  This only comes around every four years.
[03:12:09.441 --> 03:12:12.063]  Who's up next here to talk to Mr. Stone?
[03:12:12.063 --> 03:12:13.284]  Doug in Ohio.
[03:12:13.284 --> 03:12:13.905]  You're on the air.
[03:12:13.905 --> 03:12:16.247]  Welcome.
[03:12:16.247 --> 03:12:17.508]  Hey, Alex.
[03:12:17.508 --> 03:12:19.349]  Welcome, Doug.
[03:12:19.349 --> 03:12:20.530]  Hey, good day, Alex.
[03:12:20.530 --> 03:12:21.111]  Mr. Stone.
[03:12:21.567 --> 03:12:27.936]  Hey, as well as my info warriors out there, as well as we all know, America is the sickest country in the world.
[03:12:27.936 --> 03:12:32.282]  90% of our food is banned in 160 countries.
[03:12:32.282 --> 03:12:35.406]  We have a Diavita dialysis on every corner like a McDonald's.
[03:12:35.876 --> 03:12:37.697]  When will Trump expose this?
[03:12:37.697 --> 03:12:42.579]  And what will he do to the corporations manufacturing all this poison that they call food?
[03:12:42.579 --> 03:12:44.820]  Another reason, I forget all the good stuff he's done.
[03:12:44.820 --> 03:12:52.123]  He's come out against vaccines and said that they've got liability protection, they need to be studied, they're causing problems, there's too many of them.
[03:12:52.123 --> 03:12:54.264]  Again, I just forget why I like him!
[03:12:54.824 --> 03:12:56.125]  Yeah, he's an independent thinker.
[03:12:56.125 --> 03:13:00.308]  He understands the problem isn't the vaccines, the problem is what's in the vaccines.
[03:13:00.308 --> 03:13:02.110]  The mercury and other products.
[03:13:02.110 --> 03:13:06.913]  You can imagine how the medical establishment went crazy when he said this.
[03:13:06.913 --> 03:13:08.615]  Trump's a truth teller.
[03:13:08.615 --> 03:13:12.097]  Everything you keep saying about him, he comes out and that's his views.
[03:13:12.097 --> 03:13:15.460]  Where is he on Big Pharma, on vaccines, on eugenics?
[03:13:15.460 --> 03:13:18.022]  This is a great call from the listener, Doug.
[03:13:19.542 --> 03:13:21.523]  Let me just say, stay tuned.
[03:13:21.523 --> 03:13:23.664]  This is just the beginning of the campaign.
[03:13:23.664 --> 03:13:25.085]  Wait until we get into the general election.
[03:13:25.085 --> 03:13:25.865]  So he knows what he's doing.
[03:13:25.865 --> 03:13:26.945]  He rolls it out.
[03:13:26.945 --> 03:13:28.286]  Well, one thing at a time.
[03:13:28.286 --> 03:13:29.826]  He talks about monetary policy.
[03:13:29.826 --> 03:13:33.468]  Is it going to be basically Ron Paul meets Alex Jones meets Roger Stone by the end?
[03:13:33.468 --> 03:13:34.688]  Well, we can only hope.
[03:13:34.688 --> 03:13:35.669]  Meets Donald Trump.
[03:13:35.669 --> 03:13:37.890]  No one puts words in Donald Trump's mouth.
[03:13:37.890 --> 03:13:41.111]  I am neither a formal nor an informal part of his campaign.
[03:13:41.551 --> 03:13:42.772]  I'm just an FOT.
[03:13:42.772 --> 03:13:45.395]  I'm a friend of Trump, just like I'm an FOJ.
[03:13:45.395 --> 03:13:47.037]  I'm a friend of Jones.
[03:13:47.037 --> 03:13:48.999]  And I operate completely independently.
[03:13:48.999 --> 03:13:52.903]  Donald Trump doesn't approve anything I do, nor do I ask for approval.
[03:13:52.903 --> 03:13:56.146]  But I would do anything he asked me to, to help him get elected President.
[03:13:56.146 --> 03:13:57.087]  You're like a little angel.
[03:13:57.267 --> 03:14:14.181]  Well, look, he's the last best hope for this country, folks, and that's why I've dedicated the rest of my year through this November to making sure that Hillary Clinton is stopped and that she and her husband and her daughter go to prison where they belong because their crimes are manifest.
[03:14:14.181 --> 03:14:19.065]  But more importantly, that we elect somebody who can save this country.
[03:14:19.065 --> 03:14:20.566]  The hour grows late.
[03:14:20.566 --> 03:14:23.789]  Is Donald Trump or a thousand years of darkness for the United States?
[03:14:24.269 --> 03:14:25.290]  Well, that's the plan.
[03:14:25.290 --> 03:14:25.870]  Thank you, Doug.
[03:14:25.870 --> 03:14:26.470]  Great question.
[03:14:26.470 --> 03:14:27.371]  Kristen in Ohio.
[03:14:27.371 --> 03:14:31.473]  You're on the air worldwide.
[03:14:31.473 --> 03:14:33.115]  Hi.
[03:14:33.115 --> 03:14:35.696]  I had a couple questions, actually.
[03:14:35.696 --> 03:14:44.281]  My first one is, with all the illegal immigration stuff that Donald Trump talks about,
[03:14:45.837 --> 03:14:55.586]  Wouldn't it be smarter to put sanctions on the big companies that are actually hiring the illegal immigrants?
[03:14:55.586 --> 03:14:57.488]  Because that's why they're coming over.
[03:14:57.488 --> 03:14:59.490]  If they can't
[03:15:00.669 --> 03:15:01.730]  You know, get jobs.
[03:15:01.730 --> 03:15:05.093]  I'll be honest, the wall sounds kind of like just a big campaign stunt.
[03:15:05.093 --> 03:15:06.534]  People get it.
[03:15:06.534 --> 03:15:13.179]  But I mean, isn't it go after the employers and then also, you know, incentivize employers to hire Americans?
[03:15:13.179 --> 03:15:14.600]  Look, give Trump his due.
[03:15:14.600 --> 03:15:15.981]  He understands the labor market.
[03:15:15.981 --> 03:15:20.585]  He also understands how, in many cases, you can't find Americans to fill these jobs.
[03:15:20.585 --> 03:15:21.926]  That is just a fact.
[03:15:22.426 --> 03:15:27.330]  But he's a giant critic of our visa program, unlike Ted Cruz, unlike Marco Rubio.
[03:15:27.330 --> 03:15:34.475]  And I think you'd see a completely revamping of our current immigration system to one that makes sense.
[03:15:34.475 --> 03:15:40.260]  One thing I can tell you, Donald Trump is not in the pocket of big business or big anything.
[03:15:40.260 --> 03:15:46.845]  Donald Trump believes in American sovereignty and he believes in putting America first.
[03:15:46.845 --> 03:15:51.188]  So look for Donald Trump to completely revamp, completely rewrite
[03:15:51.548 --> 03:15:56.290]  Our current flawed, broken immigration system.
[03:15:56.290 --> 03:15:57.090]  Other questions?
[03:15:57.090 --> 03:16:04.133]  Yeah, I just had another one.
[03:16:04.133 --> 03:16:18.099]  He talks about he wants to expand our military, but isn't the military one of the costs of the military, one of the leading causes of national debt?
[03:16:18.831 --> 03:16:24.353]  I think he says he's going to make it strong and you can do that with half the money without all these boondoggles and screw jobs.
[03:16:24.353 --> 03:16:28.395]  The F-15 is better than the new billion dollar fighters that don't even work.
[03:16:28.395 --> 03:16:30.856]  And the $700 toilet seats.
[03:16:30.856 --> 03:16:32.477]  What's Trump's real view?
[03:16:32.477 --> 03:16:41.761]  I think what Trump understands is you can afford a stronger and sleeker and leaner but more effective military if you rebuild the American economy.
[03:16:42.321 --> 03:16:48.365]  The problem of course is massive defense spending when you're running a deficit, when the country's broke.
[03:16:48.365 --> 03:16:57.511]  So he understands step one, revitalize our economy, get America cooking again, then you can afford a national defense second to none.
[03:16:57.511 --> 03:17:02.254]  Right now we're spending on defense, although at inadequate levels, at the same time we're broke.
[03:17:02.874 --> 03:17:12.319]  Now, add to that that we decide, for example, to depose Qaddafi in Libya, but we have to go to the national credit card to borrow the $880 million.
[03:17:12.319 --> 03:17:14.980]  Yeah, we got special interests that are bringing the country down.
[03:17:14.980 --> 03:17:17.421]  To bomb Qaddafi into oblivion.
[03:17:17.421 --> 03:17:18.762]  Look, the elites have decided we're done.
[03:17:18.762 --> 03:17:19.302]  They're just left.
[03:17:19.302 --> 03:17:22.344]  They're stealing everything they can right now, like a hot stove, like you said.
[03:17:22.344 --> 03:17:23.484]  Christian, great questions.
[03:17:23.484 --> 03:17:26.045]  I want to bring David Knight in for a question or two before he takes over.
[03:17:26.045 --> 03:17:28.006]  David Knight from the Situation Room.
[03:17:28.006 --> 03:17:30.868]  David Knight, do you have any comments or questions for Mr. Stone?
[03:17:31.388 --> 03:17:45.959]  Yeah, Alex, when I looked at what Vincente Fox said, his effing comment, when you actually read what he went on to say beyond that, what he was really angry about was that 44% of Hispanics had voted for Donald Trump in Nevada.
[03:17:46.679 --> 03:18:00.588]  And I thought it was interesting, we talked about this a little bit last night, just before the debate, Fox said, it's not to defend our race, it's not to defend our creed, but to defend the nation that is hosting you.
[03:18:00.588 --> 03:18:13.576]  That raised a ton of questions in my mind, because it sounded like he was appealing to them to vote on a racial basis, on some kind of a creed basis, which I'm not sure what that is, but also the fact that he says,
[03:18:14.116 --> 03:18:16.917]  Defend the nation that is hosting you.
[03:18:16.917 --> 03:18:20.678]  Now, that implies, I guess, that these people are voting when they're not citizens.
[03:18:20.678 --> 03:18:21.878]  They're simply being hosted.
[03:18:21.878 --> 03:18:27.480]  It all ties into the North American Union aspect that we're looking at here.
[03:18:27.480 --> 03:18:30.021]  But I wanted to get Roger Stone's comments on that.
[03:18:30.021 --> 03:18:33.262]  The idea that this Mexican, former Mexican president... Exactly.
[03:18:33.262 --> 03:18:34.502]  Doesn't this show the insane
[03:18:34.742 --> 03:18:44.427]  Arrogance of the establishment, that the Pope and the Chinese Communist leaders and the Mexican former president with all his brother, one of the biggest drug dealers out there on record, telling us what to do?
[03:18:44.427 --> 03:18:44.887]  No!
[03:18:44.887 --> 03:18:46.928]  Mexico would laugh at us if we did that.
[03:18:46.928 --> 03:18:50.790]  Yeah, I'm very familiar of course with the North American Union.
[03:18:50.790 --> 03:18:55.132]  As you know, Ted Cruz's wife Heidi has been a major progenitor of that.
[03:18:55.132 --> 03:18:55.832]  Skip the break.
[03:18:56.092 --> 03:18:58.454]  To her membership at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:18:58.454 --> 03:19:01.918]  Look, here's my message for Vincente Fox.
[03:19:01.918 --> 03:19:04.921]  The Trump Justice Department's coming for your brother.
[03:19:04.921 --> 03:19:06.222]  They're coming for your brother.
[03:19:06.222 --> 03:19:07.744]  They're going to arrest him.
[03:19:07.744 --> 03:19:09.245]  They're going to prosecute him.
[03:19:09.245 --> 03:19:12.989]  And they're going to jail him because he is poisoning our children.
[03:19:12.989 --> 03:19:15.692]  And you're going to be investigated too, Fox, just like when I bullhorned you.
[03:19:16.756 --> 03:19:17.657]  Fox is a criminal.
[03:19:17.657 --> 03:19:18.957]  His brother's a criminal.
[03:19:18.957 --> 03:19:21.779]  Most of those in the Mexican government are criminals.
[03:19:21.779 --> 03:19:23.360]  And Trump is exactly right.
[03:19:23.360 --> 03:19:24.981]  They're shipping us the rapists.
[03:19:24.981 --> 03:19:26.581]  They're shipping us the scum.
[03:19:26.581 --> 03:19:27.942]  They're shipping us the criminals.
[03:19:27.942 --> 03:19:30.103]  And then it's a con game, like a raped woman.
[03:19:30.103 --> 03:19:33.685]  He sits there slapping us and choking us, saying it's our fault.
[03:19:33.685 --> 03:19:35.566]  No, get off us, you rapists!
[03:19:35.566 --> 03:19:38.228]  Here's the irony, and the liberals are going to hate this.
[03:19:38.228 --> 03:19:41.970]  Donald Trump will get record numbers of African American votes.
[03:19:42.310 --> 03:19:43.871]  He already is, the polls show it.
[03:19:43.871 --> 03:19:45.352]  Record numbers of Hispanic voters.
[03:19:45.352 --> 03:19:49.175]  Tell us how he'll destroy Hillary, because he really will in the numbers.
[03:19:49.175 --> 03:19:52.977]  If young black men are incarcerated in this country, it's because of Bill Clinton.
[03:19:52.977 --> 03:19:56.920]  It's because of the crime bill that Bill Clinton signed.
[03:19:56.920 --> 03:20:02.164]  These are people, black people, who Hillary Clinton said had to be made to heal.
[03:20:02.164 --> 03:20:02.484]  Bill Clinton.
[03:20:02.484 --> 03:20:04.545]  In other words, she said that they were super predators.
[03:20:04.545 --> 03:20:06.607]  Yes, and that they had to be made to heal.
[03:20:06.607 --> 03:20:08.448]  Look folks, this is very simple.
[03:20:08.448 --> 03:20:09.449]  Black lives matter.
[03:20:10.149 --> 03:20:18.336]  Unless you're Bill Clinton's African-American son, Danny Williams, in which case your life doesn't matter because you've been banished by Hillary.
[03:20:18.336 --> 03:20:20.158]  Bill Clinton has a black son.
[03:20:20.158 --> 03:20:21.739]  He's a fine young man.
[03:20:21.739 --> 03:20:24.942]  He's been discarded like a piece of garbage.
[03:20:24.942 --> 03:20:29.746]  And the Washington Post writes, oh, a DNA test proved that that was all false.
[03:20:29.746 --> 03:20:32.589]  No, folks, there is no DNA test.
[03:20:32.589 --> 03:20:34.771]  Bill has a black son, Danny Williams.
[03:20:35.111 --> 03:20:37.412]  Hillary Clinton is the one who banished him.
[03:20:37.412 --> 03:20:42.213]  Wait until African-American voters hear about this, and they will.
[03:20:42.213 --> 03:20:44.293]  And that's why they're banning you all over TV.
[03:20:44.293 --> 03:20:46.454]  Absolutely, because they're scared of the truth.
[03:20:46.454 --> 03:20:50.235]  They know when it comes to the Clintons and the Bushes, I'm a truth teller.
[03:20:50.235 --> 03:20:55.456]  Well, I've read your books, and I've lived battling the Clintons, and I've lived exposing the UK, and they're dead on.
[03:20:55.876 --> 03:20:58.417]  Well, I've lived inside the belly of the beast.
[03:20:58.417 --> 03:21:01.239]  I know the dirty secrets of the political establishment.
[03:21:01.239 --> 03:21:03.220]  And folks, I'm not going to be silenced.
[03:21:03.220 --> 03:21:08.383]  I'm not going to be shut up by the twisted freaks at Media Matters from America.
[03:21:08.383 --> 03:21:11.104]  These people are an adjunct of the Clinton Foundation.
[03:21:11.104 --> 03:21:12.625]  An adjunct of the Clinton Foundation.
[03:21:12.625 --> 03:21:14.906]  And they give the orders to MSNBC and CNN.
[03:21:14.906 --> 03:21:17.708]  They literally give orders in there and they follow it the next day.
[03:21:17.708 --> 03:21:19.048]  How pathetic!
[03:21:19.048 --> 03:21:20.449]  White House run dirtbags.
[03:21:20.489 --> 03:21:25.431]  So what it proves is that CNN is not a legitimate news organization.
[03:21:25.431 --> 03:21:28.352]  They're merely an adjunct of the Clinton spin machine.
[03:21:28.352 --> 03:21:31.493]  Yeah, saying that, Fox, I guess Fox is really great compared to them.
[03:21:31.493 --> 03:21:35.475]  And Alex, that ties into what I was going to also say to Roger Stone.
[03:21:35.475 --> 03:21:43.718]  When we look at the way this debate was set up last night, of course it was CNN and Telemundo, and I think that was also an effort that everything was targeted towards Trump.
[03:21:43.718 --> 03:21:46.179]  They were saying, we'll see what Telemundo thinks.
[03:21:46.179 --> 03:21:47.500]  Yeah, they're upset because
[03:21:48.320 --> 03:21:56.786]  Trump won the majority of the Hispanic vote, and so they're trying to play the race card, just as Vicente Foxx said.
[03:21:56.786 --> 03:22:01.550]  Even Foxx this morning, the talking point was, it's whites that are angry, that's why they like Trump.
[03:22:01.550 --> 03:22:02.430]  What?
[03:22:02.430 --> 03:22:04.092]  I'm tired of seeing everything shut down.
[03:22:04.092 --> 03:22:05.072]  I want prosperity.
[03:22:05.072 --> 03:22:05.973]  I want lower taxes.
[03:22:05.973 --> 03:22:07.334]  That has nothing to do with what color I am.
[03:22:07.614 --> 03:22:11.276]  Donald Trump's entire message is aspirational.
[03:22:11.276 --> 03:22:13.778]  Trump stands for economic opportunity, for growth.
[03:22:13.778 --> 03:22:16.820]  I'll tell you what black people want, what hispanic people want.
[03:22:16.820 --> 03:22:18.501]  They want a piece of the pie!
[03:22:18.501 --> 03:22:19.602]  They want American fair trade.
[03:22:19.602 --> 03:22:21.824]  But Farrakhan said, give us some of this dirt!
[03:22:21.824 --> 03:22:24.365]  They don't want to be employees, they want to be employers.
[03:22:24.365 --> 03:22:26.246]  Trump understands the aspiration.
[03:22:26.246 --> 03:22:37.174]  Could you believe that Farrakhan even came out to us and said, Donald Trump is right, you can't bring in all these radical muslims, because a bunch of them are terrorists, it'll make other muslims look bad, and I think Donald Trump might want to actually get the country going again?
[03:22:37.974 --> 03:22:38.814]  I mean, that was crazy.
[03:22:38.814 --> 03:22:40.175]  Trump stands for prosperity.
[03:22:40.175 --> 03:22:42.875]  I think most Americans understand that.
[03:22:42.875 --> 03:22:44.556]  I'm going to hand this back over to you here.
[03:22:44.556 --> 03:22:45.356]  We've got more calls.
[03:22:45.356 --> 03:22:47.136]  I know you can go to them.
[03:22:47.136 --> 03:22:48.997]  And you've got a lot more coming up today, David Knight.
[03:22:48.997 --> 03:22:51.877]  But any other questions here for Mr. Stone?
[03:22:51.877 --> 03:22:54.238]  Well, I just think that's exactly the case.
[03:22:54.238 --> 03:23:02.120]  As we were looking last night, we had the Telemundo reporter that kept going back to these issues that were very narrow, like bankruptcy for Puerto Rico.
[03:23:03.320 --> 03:23:05.602]  What she doesn't understand is what you were just saying there.
[03:23:05.602 --> 03:23:14.288]  The fact that he transcends all the demographics and we don't need to be compartmentalized into this kind of balkanized reaction.
[03:23:14.288 --> 03:23:15.889]  Let me stop you, David.
[03:23:15.889 --> 03:23:16.729]  Repeat what you've said.
[03:23:16.729 --> 03:23:17.750]  Stone hasn't heard it.
[03:23:17.750 --> 03:23:23.014]  Just a few months ago, you were still on the fence about Trump because, you know, you're a pure constitutionalist.
[03:23:23.014 --> 03:23:24.755]  And I respect that's why I hired you.
[03:23:24.755 --> 03:23:25.635]  I don't control what you say.
[03:23:25.635 --> 03:23:26.456]  Sometimes we disagree.
[03:23:26.456 --> 03:23:28.457]  There are folks in this office still that don't like Trump.
[03:23:28.457 --> 03:23:28.898]  That's fine.
[03:23:29.658 --> 03:23:35.003]  I just don't need to be judged like I'm bad because, you know, I don't have the... It's not a purist issue.
[03:23:35.003 --> 03:23:37.044]  The whole power structure is against him.
[03:23:37.044 --> 03:23:38.866]  He represents populism.
[03:23:38.866 --> 03:23:41.748]  If he turns bad later, that isn't even the issue now.
[03:23:41.748 --> 03:23:43.109]  We know what we got is bad.
[03:23:43.109 --> 03:23:44.090]  This is all in.
[03:23:44.090 --> 03:23:49.635]  How are we going to feel if they shoot him and kill him, set him up, his plane blows up, they steal the election from him?
[03:23:49.635 --> 03:23:51.156]  He'll be a hero regardless.
[03:23:51.556 --> 03:23:55.919]  So, I'm just not going to sit here on the fence, hot or warm, I spit you out of my mouth.
[03:23:55.919 --> 03:23:57.140]  I'm all in for Trump.
[03:23:57.140 --> 03:23:58.701]  I'll criticize stuff I disagree with.
[03:23:58.701 --> 03:24:02.143]  He crosses too many lines, I'll say, okay, I think Trump's got problems.
[03:24:02.143 --> 03:24:03.524]  And I won't be ashamed to say it.
[03:24:03.524 --> 03:24:06.826]  I don't buy into a person, I buy into a movement, an idea.
[03:24:06.826 --> 03:24:08.187]  My gut tells me it's the right move.
[03:24:08.187 --> 03:24:10.508]  But you now are saying you're going to vote for Trump.
[03:24:10.508 --> 03:24:12.270]  I think we're going today to vote.
[03:24:12.270 --> 03:24:16.853]  You and I and others, we're going to go videotape it as well, because it's early voting for next Monday.
[03:24:16.853 --> 03:24:18.013]  Everybody should go vote.
[03:24:18.013 --> 03:24:19.955]  And I got a little voter card and a whole nine yards.
[03:24:20.615 --> 03:24:42.788]  This is the first time, I'll be honest, I've voted in about eight years, because as a political guy I can cover a lot of stuff, get millions of votes for people, but plus I know there's so much hanky-panky going on, but this is so big, I'm actually going to vote today, we're going to videotape the whole thing, and so share your testimony of why you've now converted to, you know, not buying into all of Trump as you said, but you're going to vote for him in the Texas primary.
[03:24:43.393 --> 03:24:55.604]  Yeah Alex, when I look at issues that I disagree with Trump on, things like eminent domain, other issues of individual liberty, I don't see a difference between Trump or the rest of the Republican candidates, certainly not between him and the Democrat candidates.
[03:24:55.604 --> 03:25:06.293]  But what I do see are some core issues, and as I've mentioned before, the three core issues about globalist control, and I believe that I can trust him on that because 35 years ago he's
[03:25:07.654 --> 03:25:12.516]  Paying $100,000 to take out ads complaining about the managed trade.
[03:25:12.516 --> 03:25:13.596]  It's not free trade.
[03:25:13.596 --> 03:25:14.536]  It's managed trade.
[03:25:14.536 --> 03:25:17.997]  It's being managed by people outside of our country to our disadvantage.
[03:25:17.997 --> 03:25:18.758]  To take out.
[03:25:18.758 --> 03:25:19.238]  Exactly.
[03:25:19.238 --> 03:25:22.739]  And so he understands that we're at the core where these things are coming together now.
[03:25:22.739 --> 03:25:28.861]  When we look at the open borders, that's an attempt to balkanize the societies of the West as well as to
[03:25:29.261 --> 03:25:32.984]  Manage our trade with these international trade agreements, TPP, TTIP.
[03:25:32.984 --> 03:25:38.968]  They're going to manage these trade agreements with an international commission that is not accountable to us.
[03:25:38.968 --> 03:25:40.789]  It's not appointed by us.
[03:25:40.789 --> 03:25:42.990]  Senator Sessions has pointed that out.
[03:25:42.990 --> 03:25:47.313]  And so we're going to have managed trade managed by an unaccountable commission outside of us.
[03:25:47.313 --> 03:25:55.959]  And then, of course, you've got the climate treaty issue, which would be a globalist tax imposed upon us again by a multinational commission.
[03:25:55.959 --> 03:25:58.220]  He says vaccines have bad additives.
[03:25:58.220 --> 03:25:58.941]  We look at it.
[03:25:59.281 --> 03:26:00.762]  He says he's going to prosecute Hillary.
[03:26:00.762 --> 03:26:02.463]  He's going to investigate 9-11 Truth.
[03:26:02.463 --> 03:26:03.864]  Oppose the cap and trade.
[03:26:03.864 --> 03:26:05.024]  I mean, he just goes on and on.
[03:26:05.024 --> 03:26:06.485]  I don't know how we couldn't support him.
[03:26:06.485 --> 03:26:07.185]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:26:07.185 --> 03:26:12.148]  So there's a lot of issues that are within the purview of the President to do something about it.
[03:26:12.148 --> 03:26:16.610]  And when it comes to liberty, we all have to understand, nobody is going to give you your freedom.
[03:26:16.610 --> 03:26:17.471]  You have to take it.
[03:26:17.551 --> 03:26:21.473]  And I believe that's a fight that we really need to do at the local and the state level.
[03:26:21.473 --> 03:26:24.714]  We can do it with things like jury nullification, state nullification, things like that.
[03:26:24.714 --> 03:26:28.996]  We're not going to get everything done by a president at the federal level.
[03:26:28.996 --> 03:26:30.196]  That's just the reality of things.
[03:26:30.196 --> 03:26:32.277]  So we need to win where we can win.
[03:26:32.277 --> 03:26:43.122]  If we've got somebody that I believe we can trust, because this has been an issue for him his entire life on this trade issue, this destroying our country on the border issue, which is a part of that, on the climate issue, cap and trade, that's also a part of that.
[03:26:43.402 --> 03:26:49.925]  Absolutely, and then they're scared to death of him for real, and he's doing things that no person who was with the system would do in their right mind.
[03:26:49.925 --> 03:27:03.432]  Do you agree, Stone, in closing, that we're seeing irrevocable harm to the corrupt kleptocrats that have hijacked the nation, and that regardless, Trump is dealing grievous, grievous blows to the system that will be felt for decades?
[03:27:03.632 --> 03:27:07.113]  Look Alex, I don't argue that Donald Trump is a pure conservative.
[03:27:07.113 --> 03:27:10.733]  My friends at National Review, and those guys are my friends, that's their thing.
[03:27:10.733 --> 03:27:11.894]  They're looking for purism.
[03:27:11.894 --> 03:27:12.954]  How pure are they?
[03:27:12.954 --> 03:27:27.657]  I argue simple that he is the best choice for conservatives in 2016 because on the big picture issues, our fiscal situation, our immigration situation, our trade situation, our foreign policy, he's the best choice for conservatives this year.
[03:27:27.657 --> 03:27:28.197]  That's why I'm...
[03:27:29.537 --> 03:27:33.318]  You know, the holier-than-thou conservatives have sold us out.
[03:27:33.318 --> 03:27:35.838]  Their rhetoric's great, their actions are bad.
[03:27:35.838 --> 03:27:39.019]  They can sit there and talk about, you know, purist stuff all day long.
[03:27:39.019 --> 03:27:47.140]  They haven't delivered, and they're scared that their buddies that control the big pie and are running the show might not be in charge anymore.
[03:27:47.140 --> 03:27:51.681]  That's what all this is about, is they're afraid he's in there nuzzling them out of the trough.
[03:27:51.681 --> 03:27:53.342]  They may think he's worse than they are.
[03:27:53.342 --> 03:27:55.582]  They are genuinely scared of Donald Trump.
[03:27:56.684 --> 03:27:57.304]  Absolutely.
[03:27:57.304 --> 03:27:59.285]  Alex, it's been a great pleasure to be with you.
[03:27:59.285 --> 03:28:02.266]  Come out and see me at Brave New Books here in Austin tomorrow night, 7 to 9.
[03:28:02.266 --> 03:28:06.068]  I'm going to speak, I'm going to take some questions, I'm going to sign some books.
[03:28:06.068 --> 03:28:10.189]  It's very exciting to do a grassroots thing like that, to see the real people come out.
[03:28:10.189 --> 03:28:11.050]  And it's extraordinary.
[03:28:11.050 --> 03:28:12.851]  People are hungry for the truth.
[03:28:12.851 --> 03:28:18.733]  They're ready for leadership and I think more and more they recognize Donald Trump is the last best hope for this country.
[03:28:19.253 --> 03:28:21.214]  Well, he sure got the establishment having a heart attack.
[03:28:21.214 --> 03:28:22.295]  David, I'm going to hand the baton back to you.
[03:28:22.295 --> 03:28:23.475]  You've got a lot of callers there.
[03:28:23.475 --> 03:28:24.155]  Thank you so much.
[03:28:24.155 --> 03:28:30.999]  A great job with the crew last night covering the final Republican debate before Super Tuesday.
[03:28:30.999 --> 03:28:33.860]  These are epic times to be alive for the viewers and listeners.

[03:28:42.725 --> 03:28:44.886]  The future of our world's being shaped.

[03:28:59.974 --> 03:29:01.655]  Thank you so much, Roger Stone.
[03:29:01.655 --> 03:29:02.656]  Alex, great to be here.
[03:29:02.656 --> 03:29:03.496]  Day to night.
[03:29:03.496 --> 03:29:04.197]  You're in charge.
[03:29:04.197 --> 03:29:04.677]  God bless you.
[03:29:05.458 --> 03:29:11.519]  Well, Alex, I want to take some of the calls here, but before we do, of course, last night was actually a lot of fun.
[03:29:11.519 --> 03:29:16.821]  It was a free-for-all brawl, and there's been some fallout from this.
[03:29:16.821 --> 03:29:19.981]  I want to get your comments about what you thought about the debate last night.
[03:29:19.981 --> 03:29:27.123]  One of the things that I thought was interesting that developed this last week was the push for appointing a Supreme Court replacement for Scalia.
[03:29:27.123 --> 03:29:34.945]  And I thought it was very interesting that the Democrats got together and offered this to a Republican governor from Nevada who is sitting there.
[03:29:35.465 --> 03:29:38.167]  That could have been very difficult for the Republicans to handle.
[03:29:38.167 --> 03:29:42.350]  But of course, Mitch McConnell called him up and then he declined the offer.
[03:29:42.350 --> 03:29:47.693]  So maybe they really do mean that they're going to allow the next president to select Supreme Court justices.
[03:29:47.693 --> 03:29:47.973]  We'll see.
[03:30:00.345 --> 03:30:05.889]  It turns out Hillary Clinton and her top aides aren't the only ones with secret email aliases.
[03:30:05.889 --> 03:30:16.057]  Documents uncovered through the Freedom of Information Act reveal that former Attorney General Eric Holder used a false name for his official Justice Department email account.
[03:30:16.357 --> 03:30:27.047]  According to documents obtained by Vice News, all mentions of Lou Alcindor, the birth name of basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, were actually referring to Holder himself.
[03:30:27.047 --> 03:30:38.318]  In response to the FOIA release, a Justice Department spokesman said that Holder's actions, they're not improper, legally questionable, or used to thwart FOIA requests seeking information on the former Attorney General.
[03:30:38.618 --> 03:30:40.521]  Hmm, where have we heard that before?
[03:30:40.521 --> 03:30:51.537]  Experts in FOIA law say holders' Lou Alcindor identity calls into question the ability of FOIA staff to locate all emails from an official who uses an alias.
[03:30:51.537 --> 03:30:52.318]  Indeed.
[03:30:52.318 --> 03:30:54.481]  You can read more at InfoWars.com.
[03:30:59.697 --> 03:31:03.480]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:31:03.480 --> 03:31:11.225]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:31:11.225 --> 03:31:19.831]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:31:19.831 --> 03:31:24.254]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:31:24.254 --> 03:31:29.497]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[03:31:29.837 --> 03:31:34.079]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:31:34.079 --> 03:31:37.501]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[03:31:37.501 --> 03:31:48.626]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[03:31:58.030 --> 03:32:02.675]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male, and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[03:32:02.675 --> 03:32:07.441]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[03:32:07.441 --> 03:32:08.762]  Talk about the effects.
[03:32:08.762 --> 03:32:10.264]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[03:32:10.264 --> 03:32:12.206]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[03:32:12.206 --> 03:32:13.327]  I feel like I look better.
[03:32:13.327 --> 03:32:14.028]  I feel better.
[03:32:14.028 --> 03:32:15.449]  I feel sexier.
[03:32:15.449 --> 03:32:15.810]  I love it.
[03:32:16.050 --> 03:32:19.012]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[03:32:19.012 --> 03:32:21.954]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.

[03:33:20.627 --> 03:33:23.931]  Yeah, last night was kind of like Reservoir Dogs, wasn't it?
[03:33:31.925 --> 03:33:32.585]  That's right.
[03:33:32.585 --> 03:33:38.167]  At one point when he was calling Rubio a choker, I said, yeah, liars to the left of me.
[03:33:38.167 --> 03:33:42.249]  He kind of points to Cruz and he says, chokers to the right.
[03:33:42.249 --> 03:33:45.090]  I think Rubio was just upset because he's Mr. Pink.
[03:33:45.090 --> 03:33:49.391]  You know, he can't get away from what happened in the research that's coming out.
[03:33:49.391 --> 03:33:53.293]  If you don't know what I mean, look up Wayne Madsen's story about Marco Rubio.
[03:33:54.215 --> 03:34:13.153]  And the other thing about the debate last night was just, and I mentioned it to Roger Stone, the fact that it was very clearly set up to come after Donald Trump just before Super Tuesday, bringing in Telemundo, and I was so annoyed at the narrow focus of the Telemundo reporter.
[03:34:13.153 --> 03:34:15.656]  Everything was simply about Hispanics.
[03:34:15.656 --> 03:34:16.296]  What they don't get
[03:34:16.917 --> 03:34:26.303]  Is that Donald Trump won the Hispanic vote in Nevada, and that's something that really upsets the people who try to balkanize us into these groups.
[03:34:26.303 --> 03:34:29.465]  I saw this thing on Twitter somebody put up, and I thought it was really funny.
[03:34:29.465 --> 03:34:36.430]  It's a picture of a dog, for those of you on the radio, a picture of a dog, and then the CNN logo, the lower thirds, and it says, question.
[03:34:36.430 --> 03:34:42.274]  As president, will you extend off-leash hours in parks across the country, specifically Central Park?
[03:34:43.368 --> 03:34:48.472]  See, that's the kind of ridiculous, narrow questioning that we're getting from Telemundo.
[03:34:48.472 --> 03:34:53.335]  So I retweeted that out, and I said, well, was this guy, was this dog from Telefido?
[03:34:53.335 --> 03:34:58.439]  Or maybe he's a roving reporter from Animal Planet, you know, because that's the only thing they're interested in.
[03:34:58.439 --> 03:35:02.242]  They're not interested in the big picture issues.
[03:35:02.242 --> 03:35:03.623]  And that's what we saw last night.
[03:35:03.623 --> 03:35:09.027]  Very narrowly focused, very narrowly focused in terms of attacking Donald Trump, and of
[03:35:10.467 --> 03:35:12.128]  It did get Donald Trump angry.
[03:35:12.128 --> 03:35:17.531]  He lashed out in some Twitter tirades that had some spelling errors in them.
[03:35:17.531 --> 03:35:26.596]  And Marco Rubio, I guess taking up his new role as a little troll, became a little grammar Nazi about the typo errors.
[03:35:26.596 --> 03:35:30.398]  Perhaps Donald Trump might want to rethink this iPhone boycott.
[03:35:30.398 --> 03:35:35.421]  You know, maybe he needs to go back to something that's going to be auto-correcting or help him with that a little bit.
[03:35:36.421 --> 03:35:36.861]  Yeah, I think.
[03:35:55.487 --> 03:36:02.473]  One of the things that I think showed that this was really a rigged debate was this woman who was screaming.
[03:36:02.473 --> 03:36:05.175]  And of course we know they pack the audience.
[03:36:05.175 --> 03:36:13.161]  Earlier yesterday we had the story about how only six students from the University of Houston were going to be allowed into the debate.
[03:36:13.161 --> 03:36:19.026]  There were 800 tickets and those typically all go to insiders, to the donor class.
[03:36:19.026 --> 03:36:20.567]  But they went one beyond that.
[03:36:21.587 --> 03:36:36.262]  As we looked at Rubio's performance last night, and that's what it was, it was a performance, it was pretty obvious that he had a list of accusations he was going to throw out at Donald Trump and just keep throwing them out without allowing a response to any of those.
[03:36:36.262 --> 03:36:37.424]  But the key thing, I thought,
[03:36:38.157 --> 03:36:47.490]  Was the audience reaction and that lady who was screaming as a big fan there, and this is something that Twitter has picked up on.
[03:36:47.490 --> 03:36:52.636]  See, back in the day, that could be very effective, kind of doing that like the sitcom laugh track.
[03:36:53.177 --> 03:36:54.919]  Remember, I Love Lucy?
[03:36:54.919 --> 03:36:59.984]  There was always that woman, and for those of you old enough, it's kind of become a cultural meme, I think.
[03:36:59.984 --> 03:37:02.726]  Even if you're younger, you may know I Love Lucy.
[03:37:02.726 --> 03:37:06.050]  They would get to this point, and there'd be this woman go, uh-oh!
[03:37:06.050 --> 03:37:08.031]  And then the laughter would be fed in.
[03:37:08.031 --> 03:37:09.153]  It was a canned thing.
[03:37:09.153 --> 03:37:11.275]  But you can hire people to do that sort of thing.
[03:37:11.855 --> 03:37:22.704]  This particular woman, as I point out on Daily Mail and Twitter has picked up on it, Marco Rubio's number one fan couldn't hide her enthusiasm during Thursday's debate in Texas.
[03:37:22.704 --> 03:37:30.830]  One woman in the crowd could be heard several times throughout the evening letting out a high-pitched shriek combined with a squeal.
[03:37:30.830 --> 03:37:36.275]  The unidentified woman seemed to make the unique sound for only one candidate, however,
[03:37:36.875 --> 03:37:38.016]  Marco Rubio.
[03:37:38.016 --> 03:37:40.557]  Yeah, that's exactly it.
[03:37:40.557 --> 03:37:50.202]  Matt Popovich says, Rubio, we know you love America, but bringing in an actual eagle to shriek every time you say something might have been taking it a bit too far.
[03:37:52.023 --> 03:37:54.706]  So there's a lot of Twitter feeds about that.
[03:37:54.706 --> 03:37:56.688]  And then this last one here.
[03:37:56.688 --> 03:37:58.870]  This picture is, again, from Daily Mail.
[03:37:58.870 --> 03:38:00.712]  The subtitle that just about summed it all up.
[03:38:00.712 --> 03:38:06.157]  CNN's subtitle, closed captions, couldn't keep up with the fiery debate because everybody was talking at once.
[03:38:06.157 --> 03:38:10.482]  So what they put at the bottom here is, in brackets, unintelligible yelling.
[03:38:11.042 --> 03:38:12.723]  Because that's what it denigrated into.
[03:38:12.723 --> 03:38:15.144]  Yeah, it was a real reservoir dogfight.
[03:38:15.144 --> 03:38:19.826]  It was pretty amazing, very entertaining, but there's some real core issues.
[03:38:19.826 --> 03:38:21.286]  And we talked about that earlier.
[03:38:21.286 --> 03:38:23.667]  The thing I'm concerned about, I want to play a clip for you.
[03:38:23.667 --> 03:38:27.089]  We began our coverage last night with this clip.
[03:38:27.089 --> 03:38:35.332]  I want to play something for you because earlier in the program, Roger Stone was talking about the brokered convention, how they're going to select the delegates.
[03:38:35.865 --> 03:38:45.550]  I think many people in the Democratic Party were amazed to see, and when they look at the delegate count, you know, you've got several hundred for Hillary Clinton because that's where she started out.
[03:38:45.550 --> 03:38:48.292]  She started out with several hundred back in November.
[03:38:48.292 --> 03:38:51.793]  Those are the party insiders, the elected officials.
[03:38:51.793 --> 03:38:55.936]  And, of course, they get to vote however they wish, regardless of what the voters want.
[03:38:56.892 --> 03:39:00.593]  But they are posting those superdelegates on the Democrat side.
[03:39:00.593 --> 03:39:05.634]  A little bit more open, actually, about how they're rigging the contest than the Republicans are.
[03:39:05.634 --> 03:39:13.435]  But we had a rare, candid moment from the RNC head, the Republican National Committee Chair, Reince Priebus.
[03:39:13.435 --> 03:39:16.236]  And he had an interview with CNN's Allison Camerota.
[03:39:16.236 --> 03:39:20.957]  And I want to play you a little bit of this, because it's absolutely amazing what he says.
[03:39:20.957 --> 03:39:25.978]  He makes it sound as if the RNC is some kind of a private club.
[03:39:26.838 --> 03:39:28.339]  And they're auditioning people.
[03:39:28.339 --> 03:39:30.241]  Listen to what he has to say.
[03:39:30.241 --> 03:39:34.784]  Let's keep in mind, you asked the question in a way that I think is a little bit... Pause it a second.
[03:39:34.784 --> 03:39:38.367]  These folks are... Okay, let me give you that introduction.
[03:39:38.367 --> 03:39:47.254]  She says, isn't it time for the Republican leadership to understand they've got a front-runner and to get behind Donald Trump instead of continually
[03:39:47.734 --> 03:40:00.536]  Pushing against him trying to bring up somebody like Marco Rubio who's down at around 20% It's been kind of his ceiling as to what he's got So isn't it time that the RNC would start to coalesce around their front-runner and this is what he has to say
[03:40:01.566 --> 03:40:09.728]  You ask the question in a way that I think is a little bit... These folks are competing to join us.
[03:40:09.728 --> 03:40:11.148]  That's what's happening, right?
[03:40:11.148 --> 03:40:22.231]  So they're competing to join the Republican Party as our nominee, depending on what the delegates decide to do, or who wins the requisite amount of delegates, or whoever that is.
[03:40:22.571 --> 03:40:23.432]  Well, sort of.
[03:40:23.432 --> 03:40:25.934]  But it is a election, isn't it?
[03:40:25.934 --> 03:40:28.956]  They're competing to be the nominee of the Republican Party.
[03:40:28.956 --> 03:40:33.139]  Yes, but they're competing to become the President of the United States.
[03:40:33.139 --> 03:40:36.682]  And so they are looking for voters, all voters.
[03:40:36.682 --> 03:40:37.483]  Not voters.
[03:40:37.483 --> 03:40:39.284]  He's going to talk about delegates now.
[03:40:39.284 --> 03:40:42.987]  Listen, let me make my point.
[03:40:42.987 --> 03:40:44.088]  I haven't been able to make my point.
[03:40:44.088 --> 03:40:44.928]  Alright, go ahead.
[03:40:44.928 --> 03:40:47.791]  There are two major political parties in America.
[03:40:48.564 --> 03:40:53.587]  And he goes on to say, yeah, there's these two major political parties and see, we get to decide.
[03:40:53.587 --> 03:40:55.047]  It's not an election.
[03:40:55.047 --> 03:40:56.728]  It's a selection.
[03:40:56.728 --> 03:41:00.530]  She says, but wait a minute, but we're having this election and they got to be able to vote.
[03:41:00.530 --> 03:41:01.731]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:41:01.731 --> 03:41:03.852]  He says, this is about the delegates.
[03:41:03.852 --> 03:41:06.533]  Listen, let's understand something.
[03:41:06.533 --> 03:41:10.795]  They have 150 delegates in the Republican Party that are superdelegates.
[03:41:10.795 --> 03:41:15.418]  So that's not as many as the superdelegates in the Democrat Party, but they have about twice as many
[03:41:16.599 --> 03:41:22.302]  of the twice as many delegates needed for their overall convention.
[03:41:22.302 --> 03:41:23.903]  They've got like 2,400 or whatever.
[03:41:23.903 --> 03:41:27.165]  There's about 1,200 that are needed to win for the Republicans.
[03:41:27.165 --> 03:41:28.886]  Bottom line is this.
[03:41:28.886 --> 03:41:31.868]  There are 150 superdelegates in the Republican Party.
[03:41:31.868 --> 03:41:36.730]  To put that in perspective, you've got 155 delegates in Texas.
[03:41:36.730 --> 03:41:42.734]  So the Republican Party takes the second largest state and reserves about that number of delegates.
[03:41:43.254 --> 03:41:44.335]  California has the most.
[03:41:44.335 --> 03:41:46.096]  They have 172.
[03:41:46.096 --> 03:41:48.438]  But think about big states like New York and Florida.
[03:41:48.438 --> 03:41:52.120]  They've got 95 in New York and 99 in Florida.
[03:41:52.120 --> 03:41:56.803]  The Republican Party reserves for itself 150 delegates.
[03:41:56.803 --> 03:41:58.625]  Now those are the party insiders.
[03:41:58.625 --> 03:42:04.449]  Those are going to be people who are going to support the establishment candidates.
[03:42:04.449 --> 03:42:06.610]  That's why Rubio is hanging in there.
[03:42:06.610 --> 03:42:08.852]  That's why he had a meeting in Manhattan
[03:42:09.352 --> 03:42:16.474]  Where he had 200 donors come in, and he said, well, our path to victory lies in a brokered convention.
[03:42:16.474 --> 03:42:18.275]  That's where this is all headed.
[03:42:18.275 --> 03:42:20.535]  But I wanted you to think about the fact that he's doing that.
[03:42:20.535 --> 03:42:30.439]  And for those of you who are listening to this, what Reince Priebus is doing, the head of the RNC, is saying, no, no, they're joining us, and he's gesturing with his arms.
[03:42:30.439 --> 03:42:31.219]  They're joining us.
[03:42:32.159 --> 03:42:43.065]  I look at this and it's like, okay, we've got two sitting senators and we've got a sitting governor who I thought had already joined the Republican Party in some way.
[03:42:43.065 --> 03:42:47.508]  I don't really understand in what sense they are joining with us, okay?
[03:42:47.508 --> 03:42:55.693]  Is it some kind of a super elite secret club, you know, like the elite hunting clubs or whatever, the elite bohemian grove?
[03:42:55.693 --> 03:42:58.795]  What is this that they are joining together with?
[03:42:59.715 --> 03:43:00.636]  I don't really understand.
[03:43:00.636 --> 03:43:09.244]  I mean, does that mean that the debates are really nothing more than kind of a hazing contest for this elite fraternity that they're about to join, this super secret thing?
[03:43:09.244 --> 03:43:16.471]  You know, you gotta go through the hazing process of the debates before you learn the secret handshake and join with the Prebys.
[03:43:17.871 --> 03:43:19.212]  What is this about?
[03:43:19.212 --> 03:43:25.075]  It was beyond strange, it was beyond creepy, but it illustrates what we are really up against.
[03:43:25.075 --> 03:43:28.897]  It illustrates, I think, how this thing is truly rigged.
[03:43:28.897 --> 03:43:32.779]  And if they do do something like this, if they shut down the voters,
[03:43:33.666 --> 03:43:36.168]  People are going to be really upset.
[03:43:36.168 --> 03:43:39.070]  As Alex pointed out, it is going to be outright rebellion.
[03:43:39.070 --> 03:43:41.812]  That's what they have to really be concerned about.
[03:43:41.812 --> 03:43:50.178]  It looks now like Hillary Clinton is going to be able, with a popular vote, make the case and not have to throw her weight around with a superdelegates.
[03:43:50.178 --> 03:43:55.421]  But if the GOP pulls some kind of thing like this, there is going to be a revolution.
[03:43:55.421 --> 03:44:00.425]  And we need to understand that these people have decided that this is their own little private club.
[03:44:01.383 --> 03:44:09.025]  If you've ever worked with a third party as I have, you understand how they have rigged this process from the ground up.
[03:44:09.025 --> 03:44:10.746]  They rig ballot access.
[03:44:10.746 --> 03:44:13.626]  They rig access to the debates for third parties.
[03:44:13.626 --> 03:44:18.428]  Even when you jump through all the hoops for ballot access, you're still excluded from the debates.
[03:44:18.428 --> 03:44:19.208]  They do not.
[03:44:19.668 --> 03:44:25.936]  Want to have a different point of view and that's what has been refreshing with the Donald Trump candidacy.
[03:44:25.936 --> 03:44:29.580]  The fact that he would come in and call Jeb Bush on 9-11.
[03:44:29.580 --> 03:44:34.206]  The fact that he would talk about the missing pages of the classified report.
[03:44:34.206 --> 03:44:38.171]  The fact that he would talk about the fact that we were lied to with weapons of mass destruction.
[03:44:38.171 --> 03:44:38.792]  Can you imagine?
[03:44:39.332 --> 03:44:48.919]  Any other Republican candidate that we've had in my lifetime coming out and saying that a former Republican president had lied to people, when it is clear.
[03:44:48.919 --> 03:44:50.240]  I mean, it's been admitted.
[03:44:50.240 --> 03:44:52.841]  They admitted that they lied to the American public.
[03:44:52.841 --> 03:44:58.125]  There's no question that we went to war with Iraq and we didn't have intelligence that they had weapons of mass destruction.
[03:44:58.125 --> 03:44:59.126]  That's not a question.
[03:44:59.126 --> 03:45:00.507]  That's a matter of historical record.
[03:45:01.147 --> 03:45:02.888]  But nobody else would say that.
[03:45:02.888 --> 03:45:06.328]  That is what I think is really important about this process.
[03:45:06.328 --> 03:45:07.789]  Let's go to one of your calls here.
[03:45:07.789 --> 03:45:09.409]  Let's go to Chris in Arizona.
[03:45:09.409 --> 03:45:14.711]  You had a question about Trump on the Apple FBI issue.
[03:45:14.711 --> 03:45:16.871]  Hi, I actually did.
[03:45:16.871 --> 03:45:18.432]  Hello, how are you today, Mr. Knight?
[03:45:18.432 --> 03:45:18.992]  Doing good.
[03:45:18.992 --> 03:45:20.813]  Go ahead.
[03:45:20.813 --> 03:45:29.375]  I had a question for Mr. Stone about why he thinks Trump sided with the FBI's Apple takeover.
[03:45:29.892 --> 03:45:31.753]  Well, he's not here now, so give us your take on it.
[03:45:31.753 --> 03:45:34.055]  Tell us what you think about it.
[03:45:34.055 --> 03:45:48.366]  Well, I think maybe somebody should have taken McAfee up on his offer to unlock the phone instead of giving the FBI complete backdoor access to every phone, every Apple phone that Apple has ever made.
[03:45:48.366 --> 03:45:58.474]  I think that is a very dangerous precedent, and we've already seen too much encroachment on our natural rights as citizens, and I think that maybe
[03:45:59.224 --> 03:46:11.027]  Being a good friend of Mr. Trump, Mr. Stone should have maybe mentioned something to him about the dangers of giving the FBI that much power.
[03:46:11.027 --> 03:46:15.088]  We really should not be giving these people that much power.
[03:46:15.088 --> 03:46:15.988]  I agree.
[03:46:15.988 --> 03:46:19.609]  I think they're doing this simply to establish a precedent.
[03:46:19.609 --> 03:46:26.311]  And when I see the article saying, well, Apple gives this information to China, they're very malleable when it comes to China.
[03:46:26.311 --> 03:46:27.531]  We don't want to be China.
[03:46:28.471 --> 03:46:30.694]  China has the giant firewall.
[03:46:30.694 --> 03:46:34.858]  They have massive censorship and massive control of freedom of speech.
[03:46:34.858 --> 03:46:36.920]  They have access to everyone's data.
[03:46:36.920 --> 03:46:38.481]  We do not want to be China.
[03:46:38.481 --> 03:46:42.565]  If Apple wants to do business in China, they're going to play with that authoritarian regime.
[03:46:42.565 --> 03:46:46.549]  We need to understand that America is based on different principles and we need to understand
[03:46:47.190 --> 03:46:49.892]  That our government is doing this now.
[03:46:49.892 --> 03:46:54.255]  What they're trying to do with this, and the way that they handled this is very clear, what they did with Apple.
[03:46:54.255 --> 03:47:02.942]  Coming out first and talking about it in the press, saying that they were, Apple says that they learned about this first from the press rather than from the FBI.
[03:47:02.942 --> 03:47:09.787]  Let's understand, the FBI, the NSA, the government in general, is violating the Constitution, the Fourth Amendment.
[03:47:10.307 --> 03:47:31.723]  They are violating laws, they're listening to us all the time with stingray devices and other issues, but they're trying to establish a legal precedent, trying to come out in the open, trying to say that this is going to be okay, we're going to pass laws, even though they violate the Constitution, we're going to pass laws to give them access to our information.
[03:47:31.723 --> 03:47:32.744]  That's what we need to fight.
[03:47:32.744 --> 03:47:36.207]  I absolutely agree with you, and I think that McAfee was making the point
[03:47:36.687 --> 03:47:38.808]  That this information could be gotten to.
[03:47:38.808 --> 03:47:40.248]  They did not have to do this.
[03:47:40.248 --> 03:47:43.010]  It was simply to establish a precedent.
[03:47:43.010 --> 03:47:52.573]  And again, as I said, there are issues like this in terms of our civil liberties that I think we're going to have to fight with other people other than anyone who's running for president.
[03:47:52.573 --> 03:47:53.534]  I don't see anybody.
[03:47:53.534 --> 03:48:00.836]  Did you see anybody that came out and had a position other than McAfee, who hasn't gotten the nomination yet for the Libertarian Party?
[03:48:00.836 --> 03:48:04.458]  Did you see anybody that came out and said, no, we're going to stop this?
[03:48:06.921 --> 03:48:08.941]  Chris, are you still there?
[03:48:08.941 --> 03:48:09.622]  Yes, I'm still here.
[03:48:09.622 --> 03:48:10.562]  I'm sorry.
[03:48:10.562 --> 03:48:12.242]  I had you muted for half a second.
[03:48:12.242 --> 03:48:14.162]  My cell phone was ringing in the background.
[03:48:14.162 --> 03:48:15.202]  I'm sorry.
[03:48:15.202 --> 03:48:16.403]  Did you see anybody?
[03:48:16.403 --> 03:48:22.644]  I'm not aware of any presidential candidates, Republican or Democrat, who have come out and said, you know, that's a bit too far for the FBI.
[03:48:22.644 --> 03:48:26.304]  They're simply trying to set up a legal precedent so that they're allowed to spy on us.
[03:48:26.304 --> 03:48:28.625]  Have you seen anybody say that?
[03:48:28.625 --> 03:48:29.525]  Yes, actually.
[03:48:29.525 --> 03:48:30.405]  John McCarthy.
[03:48:30.405 --> 03:48:35.506]  Unfortunately, he's not very mainstream and a lot of people don't know about him as far as running for office.
[03:48:36.247 --> 03:48:54.497]  I also had another question for Mr. Stone about Mr. Trump's Republicans are stupid interview forever ago and I was wondering how much of that he is now ashamed of and knowing that it's coming back to bite him.
[03:48:54.497 --> 03:48:56.718]  Was he talking about voters or was he talking about politicians?
[03:48:56.718 --> 03:48:58.839]  I'm not familiar with the quote.
[03:48:58.839 --> 03:49:03.202]  He was talking about voters, how if he were to run for president he would run as a Republican
[03:49:03.978 --> 03:49:07.910]  Um, because Republicans are stupid and they'll, you know, pretty much vote for anybody.
[03:49:08.510 --> 03:49:09.511]  Well, I think that's true.
[03:49:09.511 --> 03:49:11.892]  I would agree with Donald Trump on that.
[03:49:11.892 --> 03:49:20.177]  If you look at what has happened, and this is why I think the people who are flocking behind Ted Cruz are saying, well, we agree with him on principle.
[03:49:20.177 --> 03:49:34.205]  You have to understand that these guys have violated, Mitch McConnell, especially Marco Rubio, working with the Gang of Eight when he ran as a Tea Party candidate, saying he was going to control the border and then did everything he could to subvert that.
[03:49:34.945 --> 03:49:47.497]  Republicans have been led down the primrose path by politicians who have absolutely no interest in following through on their promises, and they do it again and again and again to the Republican voters.
[03:49:47.497 --> 03:49:50.099]  But I think the Republican voters this time have woken up.
[03:49:50.740 --> 03:49:54.501]  Because Republican voters are looking at different issues.
[03:49:54.501 --> 03:49:56.441]  They're looking at pragmatic issues.
[03:49:56.441 --> 03:49:58.822]  They're looking at things that they can do for themselves.
[03:49:58.822 --> 03:50:10.145]  I heard an evangelical pastor say, in terms of the people that he knew that were supporting Trump, he said, look, they're voting for this guy who clearly is not a very strong and knowledgeable Christian.
[03:50:10.925 --> 03:50:14.167]  You know, try to make overtures to the community, but they're not really buying that.
[03:50:14.167 --> 03:50:25.513]  What they're buying is the idea that they need somebody who is going to manage the economy, who is going to do these other things, and perhaps these things that they're looking at, they're not electing a pastor-in-chief.
[03:50:25.513 --> 03:50:27.314]  They need to be the ones who are out there
[03:50:27.834 --> 03:50:28.114]  I think?
[03:50:44.267 --> 03:50:46.948]  By people like Mitch McConnell and John Boehner.
[03:50:46.948 --> 03:50:49.408]  That's why they're saying we don't want that anymore.
[03:50:49.408 --> 03:50:50.688]  We want somebody that we can trust.
[03:50:50.688 --> 03:50:56.690]  And I think one of the things that we can do is go back and look at his long-term hot-button issues, and it was the economy.
[03:50:56.690 --> 03:50:57.070]  Stay with us.
[03:50:57.070 --> 03:50:59.290]  We're going to take some more of your calls.

[03:54:11.798 --> 03:54:13.180]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:13.180 --> 03:54:14.341]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[03:54:14.341 --> 03:54:17.444]  In this last segment, we're going to go to some more of our callers.
[03:54:17.444 --> 03:54:27.235]  And before we do, I just want to let you know that, of course, Monday is the 29th, February the 29th, and we're having a once every four year leap sale.
[03:54:28.056 --> 03:54:32.138]  30% off the entire store and free shipping on orders above $50.
[03:54:32.138 --> 03:54:35.599]  This only happens once every four years.

[03:54:39.101 --> 03:54:42.462]  This is over this weekend as part of the Leap Year Sale.
[03:54:42.462 --> 03:54:43.743]  Of course, we're going to have a big show on Monday.
[03:54:43.743 --> 03:54:46.284]  We're going to have some surprise guests that are going to be coming in.
[03:54:46.744 --> 03:54:57.990]  And I am sure there's going to be a lot of stuff that is going to be breaking in terms of negative, dirty politics, last-minute stuff that always comes up before a big primary date, the day before the election.
[03:54:57.990 --> 03:55:04.974]  We're going to have a lot of stuff hitting the fan, probably starting Sunday, but definitely on Monday.
[03:55:04.974 --> 03:55:06.895]  Be ready, there's going to be a lot of dirty tricks.
[03:55:06.895 --> 03:55:13.139]  There's going to be an interesting day on Monday with our surprise guests as well as the attacks that I know are going to be released.
[03:55:13.459 --> 03:55:15.782]  Let's go to some more of your calls here.
[03:55:15.782 --> 03:55:17.584]  Let's go to Ben in Florida.
[03:55:17.584 --> 03:55:17.804]  Ben?
[03:55:17.804 --> 03:55:21.628]  Hi, thanks so much for taking my call.
[03:55:21.628 --> 03:55:22.809]  I appreciate it.
[03:55:22.809 --> 03:55:26.173]  You know, you hit the nail on the head when you were talking about the debate last night.
[03:55:26.173 --> 03:55:30.918]  Lost in all of the circus and the reality television shows that are these Republican debates,
[03:55:31.420 --> 03:55:31.680]  I don't
[03:55:54.654 --> 03:55:59.839]  Where do these guys stand, all of these candidates stand, on congressional term limits?
[03:55:59.839 --> 03:56:00.941]  We don't know.
[03:56:00.941 --> 03:56:02.682]  They never ask that question.
[03:56:02.682 --> 03:56:06.426]  Do you have any intel on where a guy like Mr. Trump might stand on that issue?
[03:56:06.426 --> 03:56:09.009]  And how important do you think the issue is, in your opinion?
[03:56:09.921 --> 03:56:12.842]  I don't know where he stands, I don't know where the others stand on that either.
[03:56:12.842 --> 03:56:19.624]  I remember when Newt Gingrich put together the contract with America and that was one of the tenets.
[03:56:19.624 --> 03:56:22.705]  It was the only one actually that they didn't enact, interestingly enough.
[03:56:22.705 --> 03:56:27.706]  They decided once they had a Republican landslide, they really didn't want term limits.
[03:56:27.706 --> 03:56:28.927]  I think term limits are good.
[03:56:30.808 --> 03:56:35.011]  We've tried multiple times to enact term limits in various ways.
[03:56:35.011 --> 03:56:38.854]  You know, in the state of Virginia, there's a one-term limit for the governor.
[03:56:38.854 --> 03:56:41.716]  A single-term limit for the governor.
[03:56:41.716 --> 03:56:45.499]  The problem I have is that we've got a permanent political class.
[03:56:45.499 --> 03:56:48.502]  These guys come in, they stay in essentially for life.
[03:56:48.502 --> 03:56:51.424]  Once they get elected, it's very hard to get somebody out as an incumbent.
[03:56:52.024 --> 03:56:55.388]  Once they do get out, if they lose, they become a lobbyist.
[03:56:55.388 --> 03:56:57.269]  If they retire, they become a lobbyist.
[03:56:57.269 --> 03:56:58.591]  They get paid off.
[03:56:58.591 --> 03:57:04.356]  I'm even more concerned, however, about the lifetime appointments for the bureaucracy.
[03:57:04.356 --> 03:57:05.537]  Think about that.
[03:57:05.537 --> 03:57:09.020]  You know, everybody knows we have lifetime appointments for Supreme Court judges.
[03:57:09.841 --> 03:57:18.368]  But once you get into these bureaucracies, which are essentially a government unto themselves, they legislate without ever being elected by us.
[03:57:18.368 --> 03:57:20.689]  So we got legislation without representation.
[03:57:20.689 --> 03:57:29.236]  They come up with mandatory fines and civil fines where they don't even have to take you to court, like this situation with the drone saying you don't register with us.
[03:57:29.236 --> 03:57:30.037]  We find out about it. $27,000.
[03:57:32.679 --> 03:57:35.801]  27,500 actually I think.
[03:57:35.801 --> 03:57:45.788]  $27,500 fine just for not registering with them and they call that a civil action just like civil asset forfeiture when they steal your car and don't accuse you of a crime, don't find you guilty of anything.
[03:57:45.788 --> 03:57:57.376]  So we have these bureaucracies that tax us without representation, they legislate without representation, they are their own government entities and these guys are essentially there for life.
[03:57:57.376 --> 03:58:00.158]  So if we're going to talk about term limits, let's talk about
[03:58:00.558 --> 03:58:06.185]  How are we going to even get Congress, in the first place, to exercise their authority?
[03:58:06.185 --> 03:58:08.047]  We want Congress to write the laws.
[03:58:08.047 --> 03:58:14.154]  We want Congress to pass the budgets, not have these out-of-control, permanently entrenched bureaucracies.
[03:58:15.475 --> 03:58:15.835]  I don't know.
