[00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:21.651]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.711 --> 00:00:24.392]  It is Tuesday, February 16th, 2016.
[00:00:24.532 --> 00:00:26.032]  I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.152 --> 00:00:27.172]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.353 --> 00:00:34.694]  Tonight, another VA scandal.
[00:00:35.314 --> 00:00:41.515]  Suicidal veterans who called the support hotline were forced to leave messages that were not returned.
[00:00:42.735 --> 00:00:48.356]  Then, an FCC commissioner says we're in jeopardy of losing our free speech.
[00:00:49.995 --> 00:00:54.724]  After that, a survivor of the Paris attacks calls for citizens to be armed.
[00:00:55.745 --> 00:00:57.288]  And Bernie the bum.
[00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:58.650]  That's next.
[00:00:59.804 --> 00:01:03.587]  The commies work for Bilderberg and Davos, period!
[00:01:04.368 --> 00:01:07.490]  You figure that out, you dummies, or it's over!
[00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:26.125]  And I see Bernie Sanders rallies, they are, I'm sorry, I'm not into how you look or whatever, but they're fat, they're stupid, they're soft, they're welfare heads, they're government workers, they are piles of self-propelled trash who are so stupid, and they've grown up in the bosom of freedom.
[00:02:00.503 --> 00:02:01.624]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:03.206]  You can't survive without it.
[00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:04.308]  But where do you get it?
[00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:10.375]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:16.302]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:33.360]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.881]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:37.441]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:02:37.721 --> 00:02:38.502]  Easy assembly.
[00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:39.362]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:39.662 --> 00:02:41.483]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:03:04.036 --> 00:03:09.660]  Well, following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, the flag is flying at half-mast there in D.C.
[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:17.585]  We now know that he will lie in repose at the Supreme Court on Friday, and his funeral will be held this Saturday at 11 a.m.
[00:03:17.965 --> 00:03:27.251]  Now, President Obama addressed the nation today, speaking about the late justice, as well as addressing any rumors surrounding his replacement.
[00:03:29.136 --> 00:03:57.061]  There's not going to be any particular position on a particular issue that determines whether or not I nominate them, but I'm going to present somebody who indisputably is qualified for the seat, and any fair-minded person, even somebody who disagreed with my politics would say, would serve with honor and integrity on the court.
[00:03:57.847 --> 00:04:00.749]  Well, let's hope that we can trust Obama to do what he says.
[00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.833]  You know, he doesn't have that much longer where he has to be shackled there by the puppet masters.
[00:04:05.893 --> 00:04:10.836]  So let's hope that he doesn't sell out the country for at least the next generation.
[00:04:11.597 --> 00:04:19.002]  But based on what we're hearing of who his potential replacements might be, this could be pretty frightening.
[00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:20.183]  One of the top
[00:04:20.663 --> 00:04:20.943]  I think so.
[00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:36.051]  All right.
[00:04:54.706 --> 00:05:03.631]  People were making anti-Islamic, anti-Muslim statements, and she promised that the Justice Department would take action when speech edges toward violence.
[00:05:03.951 --> 00:05:06.933]  Of course, she was immediately attacked on that, called out.
[00:05:07.333 --> 00:05:14.097]  She backpedaled, or she recalibrated her statements, saying, of course we prosecute deeds and not words.
[00:05:14.437 --> 00:05:22.581]  So, this is someone who obviously has a double standard of the First Amendment, and this is someone who's going to be a top appointee to the Supreme Court.
[00:05:22.761 --> 00:05:23.822]  This is quite frightening.
[00:05:24.122 --> 00:05:35.547]  So this is why it's so important to make sure the next person who is appointed, like Scalia, adheres to a very strict interpretation of the Constitution, its original meaning, its original interpretation.
[00:05:36.007 --> 00:05:39.809]  Now, a lot of concern is over the fact that Scalia's death can actually boost
[00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:42.932]  The legal chances for Obama's climate plan.
[00:05:43.312 --> 00:05:51.660]  So a vote to block the Obama administration's ambitious climate regulation was one of Scalia's last acts as a Supreme Court justice.
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:06:03.631]  Just days before he died, he voted with the other conservative members of the high court to put a hold on the administration's plans to implement the Clean Power Plan while it is litigated.
[00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:09.860]  So without Scalia, the conservative members of the court, they no longer have a majority, at least in the short term.
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.568]  And so this sudden shift has given a boost to supporters of the emissions rule.
[00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:18.933]  Now, of course, with this comes a lot of controversy.
[00:06:19.133 --> 00:06:23.297]  A lot of conspiracy theories swirling around the death of Scalia.
[00:06:23.597 --> 00:06:27.240]  One of the main things is why was he rushed to be embalmed so quickly?
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:34.306]  And now we actually have some veteran homicide investigators questioning the lack of an autopsy in Scalia's death.
[00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:40.351]  One of those is retired Brooklyn homicide detective Patricia Tufo, and she was speaking with the
[00:06:41.172 --> 00:06:48.160]  New York Post, she said it's not unreasonable to ask for an autopsy in this case, particularly knowing who he is.
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:56.328]  He's not at home, there are no witnesses to his death, and there was no reported explanation for why a pillow was over his head.
[00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:59.671]  Of course, that was one of the really bizarre things that we learned.
[00:07:00.131 --> 00:07:04.354]  And then, of course, there's another former head of criminal investigations for D.C.
[00:07:04.434 --> 00:07:14.221]  police, William O. Ritchie, and he wrote a post on Facebook saying, as a former homicide commander, I am stunned that no autopsy was ordered for Justice Scalia.
[00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:18.544]  You have a Supreme Court justice who died, not in attendance of a physician.
[00:07:18.884 --> 00:07:21.446]  You have a non-homicide trained U.S.
[00:07:21.486 --> 00:07:23.307]  marshal tell the justice of the peace.
[00:07:23.727 --> 00:07:25.789]  No foul play was observed.
[00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:34.214]  You have a justice of the peace pronounce death who wasn't on the scene without any medical training opining that the justice died of a heart attack.
[00:07:34.775 --> 00:07:37.716]  What medical proof exists of a myocardial infarction?
[00:07:38.017 --> 00:07:39.758]  Why not a cerebral hemorrhage?
[00:07:40.318 --> 00:07:49.404]  And he went on to say, you know, how can this marshal say without a thorough post-mortem that he was not injected with an illegal substance that would simulate a heart attack?
[00:07:49.805 --> 00:07:53.167]  Did he check for patechial hemorrhage in his eyes or under his lips?
[00:07:54.288 --> 00:07:59.272]  That might suggest he was suffocated, maybe giving a reason why there was a pillow over his face.
[00:07:59.692 --> 00:08:02.374]  Did he check his breath for any foul odor?
[00:08:02.474 --> 00:08:04.896]  That might suggest that he was poisoned.
[00:08:05.417 --> 00:08:09.120]  My gut tells me there is something fishy going on in Texas.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.401]  And of course, we've been saying the same thing.
[00:08:11.441 --> 00:08:14.263]  Now we're wondering, will Governor Abbott look into this?
[00:08:14.283 --> 00:08:18.667]  Will he do some other further investigating into the death of Justice Scalia?
[00:08:19.007 --> 00:08:22.129]  Of course, he's previously looked into other controversial allegations.
[00:08:22.549 --> 00:08:28.314]  Over the weekend, he issued a somber condolence, recognizing the late Supreme Court Justice
[00:08:28.854 --> 00:08:35.778]  Now, despite Scalia's prominence, there is still a lot of confusion lingering over the head of how, indeed, did he die.
[00:08:36.139 --> 00:08:46.765]  Now, we had Pulitzer Prize-nominated investigative journalist John Rappaport on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show today, and he has some pretty bombshell news.
[00:08:48.066 --> 00:08:53.669]  You know, people are asking, well, is the Texas governor going to order an investigation?
[00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:55.110]  What are you talking about?
[00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:57.932]  What about the federal government?
[00:08:58.706 --> 00:09:02.967]  You know, are you saying that this is not a federal case if a U.S.
[00:09:03.007 --> 00:09:06.828]  Supreme Court justice dies under strange circumstances?
[00:09:07.208 --> 00:09:24.831]  We're hearing nothing about an FBI investigation being opened, nothing from the Attorney General, nothing from politicians in Washington who should be screaming their heads off that a Supreme Court justice of the United States dies and no autopsy is done?
[00:09:25.504 --> 00:09:32.451]  And a ruling is made off the cuff like that from a judge who's shown to be completely incompetent.
[00:09:32.531 --> 00:09:35.494]  A total goofball at the best.
[00:09:36.415 --> 00:09:43.442]  And there's nothing going on in Washington except, oh, we're very sad to say that Supreme Court Justice, you know, passed away.
[00:09:43.842 --> 00:09:44.883]  No task force.
[00:09:44.944 --> 00:09:47.186]  And Dick Cheney, his buddy, said no comment.
[00:09:47.346 --> 00:09:47.666]  Nothing.
[00:09:47.706 --> 00:09:48.027]  Just like...
[00:09:48.695 --> 00:09:49.535]  Yeah, no comment.
[00:09:51.096 --> 00:09:55.458]  It's as if they're saying, well, look, we know the public is completely asleep.
[00:09:56.158 --> 00:10:02.821]  They've been hypnotized successfully, so there's not going to be any outcry on that level, so why should we care?
[00:10:03.262 --> 00:10:09.424]  You know, so in case, in fact, we did kill him, there's just not going to be any push for an investigation.
[00:10:09.745 --> 00:10:10.985]  That's completely absurd.
[00:10:11.445 --> 00:10:16.648]  I mean, I assume that there's a whole lot of people out there in the United States by now
[00:10:17.328 --> 00:10:18.628]  Who don't even know what the U.S.
[00:10:18.648 --> 00:10:25.630]  Supreme Court is, and they've never heard of Scalia, and so they're just totally asleep at the wheel.
[00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:27.571]  But, you know, the U.S.
[00:10:27.611 --> 00:10:34.712]  Supreme Court, in case anybody's, you know, in the dark about this, is the highest judicial authority in the land.
[00:10:35.213 --> 00:10:40.514]  And so the unexplained death of a Supreme Court justice
[00:10:41.229 --> 00:10:55.603]  Would be on the same level as the death of a president or vice president or Speaker of the House or anything of that level, at least, at least.
[00:10:56.524 --> 00:10:58.646]  And yet nothing, absolutely nothing.
[00:10:59.006 --> 00:11:02.089]  I mean, reporters, mainstream reporters,
[00:11:02.944 --> 00:11:08.467]  Don't find it curious that the FBI is not opening an investigation into this death?
[00:11:08.547 --> 00:11:09.687]  That they're saying nothing?
[00:11:10.168 --> 00:11:12.009]  That nothing is happening at all?
[00:11:12.469 --> 00:11:14.730]  I mean, who are these friggin' people anyway?
[00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:15.390]  Exactly.
[00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:18.892]  And then you have in your article that you wrote, was Justice Scalia murdered?
[00:11:18.932 --> 00:11:20.753]  Forget conspiracy theory, this is real.
[00:11:20.773 --> 00:11:25.075]  You have a quote from William O. Ritchie, former head of criminal investigations for D.C.
[00:11:25.115 --> 00:11:25.435]  police.
[00:11:25.856 --> 00:11:28.717]  You have a Supreme Court justice who died not in attendance of a physician.
[00:11:28.837 --> 00:11:29.718]  What medical proof exists?
[00:11:29.738 --> 00:11:30.058]  There is none!
[00:11:30.078 --> 00:11:31.680]  And now it's all been flushed down the drain by the Embalmer.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.422]  And now the last thing that we're hearing is, well, yes, he did have a heart condition.
[00:11:54.272 --> 00:12:00.634]  Therefore, we can just automatically assume, without any medical examination whatsoever, that a U.S.
[00:12:00.654 --> 00:12:13.217]  Supreme Court justice died of a heart attack in his sleep, and the pillow was just on his face, and that's the end of that story, and we don't need to worry about who else was at the ranch, or the fact that Poindexter was a
[00:12:13.937 --> 00:12:20.061]  You know, contributor to the Democratic Party, or a Democratic supporter, or that he received an award from Obama.
[00:12:20.322 --> 00:12:24.164]  I mean, nothing of this could possibly be relevant.
[00:12:24.224 --> 00:12:32.390]  So we can just excuse all of that, and then we'll have a funeral, and his body will lie in state in Washington for a few days or a week.
[00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.271]  We don't care about the family.
[00:12:34.312 --> 00:12:43.318]  We don't care that the family is completely silent, that they have nothing to say, or at least as far as we know they have nothing to say because nothing is being reported.
[00:12:44.227 --> 00:12:51.733]  I mean, the scandal here is just enormous, regardless of the fact of whether or not he was, in fact, murdered.
[00:12:52.373 --> 00:12:59.538]  The fact that there is no federal investigation that has been opened into this, I mean, that's called a clue, folks.
[00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:01.219]  That is a clue.
[00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:02.160]  It's called a cover-up.
[00:13:02.961 --> 00:13:03.421]  I'll say it.
[00:13:03.581 --> 00:13:04.262]  It's a cover-up.
[00:13:05.142 --> 00:13:06.103]  They're covering something up.
[00:13:07.964 --> 00:13:11.165]  Well, like I said last week, it must be an election year.
[00:13:11.245 --> 00:13:15.606]  We have all of the alphabet agency heads coming out to say an attack on the U.S.
[00:13:15.646 --> 00:13:16.726]  soil is imminent.
[00:13:16.926 --> 00:13:21.467]  ISIS or their supporters are probably going to do something pretty big this year.
[00:13:21.548 --> 00:13:25.389]  And of course, I'm sure it will be timed to sway the election.
[00:13:25.789 --> 00:13:34.771]  Well, now, you know, not only are they saying this encryption, it's so terrible, we've got to weaken the right of the people to use encryption because we can't stop terrorists with it.
[00:13:35.191 --> 00:13:38.773]  Now they're actually doubling down on that need to weaken encryption.
[00:13:39.173 --> 00:13:49.139]  Now we have the CIA director John Brennan actually going to 60 Minutes saying that they knew, the CIA knew, that the system was blinking red.
[00:13:49.239 --> 00:13:55.763]  They had the warning signals there, it was blinking red, and they knew days before ISIS launched its horrific attack.
[00:13:56.423 --> 00:14:01.068]  So once again, what is the point of all of this spying when again it fails?
[00:14:01.468 --> 00:14:02.409]  But he goes on to say that
[00:14:19.246 --> 00:14:26.609]  He said, you know, the main thing that we learned from this Paris attack is that ISIS is planning a lot more attacks that we don't really know about because of this encryption.
[00:14:27.009 --> 00:14:33.391]  He also said that he is expecting ISIS or their supporters to plan some attacks here in the U.S.
[00:14:33.431 --> 00:14:38.433]  He doesn't know if they'll be successful, but he does say that if they do manage to strike in the U.S.,
[00:14:39.093 --> 00:14:43.116]  Then it will encourage us to be even more forceful.
[00:14:43.517 --> 00:14:44.538]  So what does that mean?
[00:14:44.578 --> 00:14:49.201]  Is that going to look like the permanent police state lockdown that they're experiencing in France?
[00:14:49.602 --> 00:14:57.388]  They're being more forceful there with the people in France, less freedom for the people there, more security, less encryption for you.
[00:14:58.569 --> 00:15:05.935]  But let's go ahead and take a look at what the front man for Eagles of Death Metal had to say about gun control, about this
[00:15:06.195 --> 00:15:06.936]  We're good to go.
[00:15:25.643 --> 00:15:29.526]  Gun control kind of doesn't have anything to do with it, but if you want to bring it up, I'll ask you.
[00:15:29.886 --> 00:15:34.289]  Did your French gun control stop a single f***ing person from dying at the Bataclan?
[00:15:34.409 --> 00:15:37.371]  And if anyone can answer yes, I'd like to hear it, because I don't think so.
[00:15:38.371 --> 00:15:46.637]  I think the only thing that stopped it was some of the bravest men that I've ever seen in my life charging headfirst into the face of death with their firearms.
[00:15:47.338 --> 00:15:52.284]  I think the only way my mind has been changed is maybe that until nobody has guns, everybody has to have them.
[00:15:52.825 --> 00:15:55.308]  Because I don't ever want to see anything like this ever happen again.
[00:15:56.052 --> 00:16:01.553]  So in addition to those really cool pink sunglasses, he also had some really great things to say.
[00:16:02.034 --> 00:16:10.516]  Hughes is, he's a member of America's NRA, he says he supports Donald Trump, but he went on to tell them, And this is what
[00:16:20.498 --> 00:16:32.185]  I'm really happy to see this because you've got someone there who's in the entertainment industry who isn't being duped and swirled around with what they're telling everyone in the entertainment industry to back gun control.
[00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:33.645]  You've got to be for gun control.
[00:16:33.705 --> 00:16:45.292]  Here you have someone who is faced with the terrorism that the CIA and other alphabet agencies tell us are coming to this country and he says he's not going anywhere without his gun.
[00:16:46.192 --> 00:16:48.113]  We are in an information war.
[00:16:48.514 --> 00:16:59.541]  We have the government out there telling us that ISIS is going to attack US soil this year, while at the same time we have the mainstream media telling us that we need to give up our guns.
[00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:06.766]  You know, Australia is a good example.
[00:17:06.966 --> 00:17:08.287]  Canada is a good example.
[00:17:08.807 --> 00:17:10.509]  The UK is a good example.
[00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:10.809]  Why?
[00:17:12.014 --> 00:17:13.916]  Because each of them had mass killings.
[00:17:14.356 --> 00:17:19.560]  Somebody, somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.902]  Well, this is something we should politicize.
[00:17:23.583 --> 00:17:24.504]  I'm not going to carry a gun.
[00:17:24.524 --> 00:17:26.225]  I don't want to be involved in a gun fight.
[00:17:26.345 --> 00:17:38.935]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:44.900]  Go ahead.
[00:17:45.981 --> 00:17:46.901]  Make my day.
[00:17:47.461 --> 00:17:51.403]  So the notion that gun laws don't work, it's not borne out by the evidence.
[00:17:51.843 --> 00:17:57.285]  He says that the Chicago police had a plan over this bloody 4th of July weekend.
[00:17:57.665 --> 00:18:06.129]  Nonetheless, as you indicated, Corey, there was a count of casualties that could have been from Afghanistan or Iraq.
[00:18:06.469 --> 00:18:06.949]  We'll make it.
[00:18:08.193 --> 00:18:11.076]  Harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns.
[00:18:11.516 --> 00:18:18.702]  In many cases the offenders, felons, some out on parole, some out on bond.
[00:18:19.042 --> 00:18:26.028]  We have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence.
[00:18:26.188 --> 00:18:29.631]  There are people at high levels in this government who have
[00:18:30.672 --> 00:18:32.135]  Bodyguards.
[00:18:32.375 --> 00:18:34.298]  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[00:18:34.639 --> 00:18:36.682]  The average American does not have that.
[00:18:37.043 --> 00:18:40.909]  Mayor Bloomberg, why can you defend yourself but not...
[00:18:41.772 --> 00:18:42.833]  The majority of Americans.
[00:18:42.893 --> 00:18:44.995]  I mean, look at the team of security you've got!
[00:18:45.395 --> 00:18:47.737]  Every day, every school, at every level.
[00:18:48.217 --> 00:19:01.008]  One thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this and we need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:19:10.766 --> 00:19:12.068]  We believe in win-win, folks.
[00:19:12.128 --> 00:19:13.869]  Treating people like we want to be treated.
[00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:18.634]  That's why we developed IntraCeuticals with Dr. Group and other top researchers, chemists, scientists, you name it.
[00:19:18.794 --> 00:19:19.735]  He's one of our advisors.
[00:19:20.016 --> 00:19:25.481]  To come up with products like AnthroPlex that is an original product that he made just for us.
[00:19:26.422 --> 00:19:28.384]  And this is a base
[00:19:29.298 --> 00:19:34.120]  system to make super male or super female vitality work even better.
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.180]  It is natural.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.482]  It just helps get your body pumping and going in the way you need to be going.
[00:19:40.882 --> 00:19:54.566]  And Dr. Group is here until we go to break to tell us about the latest product at Infowarslife.com, AnthroPlex, that out of the gates, and we do this all the time with the new product, we discount it out of the gates to get you to try it, knowing that you're going to love it.
[00:19:55.566 --> 00:19:56.187]  It'll sell out.
[00:19:56.527 --> 00:20:07.295]  So, Infowarslife.com, Anthroplex, 15% off and free shipping for the next two days only when you get it with Supermail or Female Vitality.
[00:20:07.435 --> 00:20:08.215]  Let's go to Dr. Group.
[00:20:08.396 --> 00:20:14.240]  Why do you call this the foundation to start the fire and then the Supermail takes you to the next level?
[00:20:15.455 --> 00:20:32.302]  Well, we just look at the base problem that's going on right now all over the world, which is the endocrine-disrupting chemicals, the amount of estrogen that men have, the femininity of men, and what's going on even in children right now with low testosterone levels.
[00:20:32.782 --> 00:20:33.443]  We're good to go!
[00:21:00.939 --> 00:21:02.800]  What is in the goat weed?
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.301]  You've got one of the purest, strongest organic forms of it.
[00:21:05.361 --> 00:21:06.922]  What's so magic about the goat weed?
[00:21:20.228 --> 00:21:33.334]  Well, the horny goat weed was given that name because years ago in India, they noticed that a certain time of the year, this weed would grow and the goats would eat it and they would just go crazy with all the female goats.
[00:21:33.394 --> 00:21:34.915]  So that's how it was developed.
[00:21:34.955 --> 00:21:35.896]  It's called epimidium.
[00:21:36.696 --> 00:21:43.400]  And what that's been proven to do over thousands of years is increase sexual pleasure, help balance the male hormones.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.181]  It can actually be used for women as well.
[00:21:45.621 --> 00:21:52.485]  But it really kind of resets and brings the hormone balance, improves sperm motility, and increases testosterone levels.
[00:21:52.505 --> 00:21:54.506]  So it counters the stuff they've been throwing at us.
[00:21:54.766 --> 00:21:55.866]  Results will vary.
[00:21:55.946 --> 00:21:58.588]  Overall, all I know is dynamite.
[00:21:59.028 --> 00:22:03.894]  I mean, absolutely dynamite with the stamina, with the weight lifting, with the swimming.
[00:22:04.134 --> 00:22:09.140]  Folks, the new product is available, AnthroPlex, available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.642]  Dr. Group, thank you for developing this amazing product.
[00:22:11.783 --> 00:22:12.083]  Thank you.
[00:23:05.102 --> 00:23:08.144]  David Knight is in Marfa with Joe Biggs and of course Josh Owens.
[00:23:08.705 --> 00:23:10.246]  And we appreciate you guys going down there.
[00:23:10.286 --> 00:23:11.587]  No other media is willing to do it.
[00:23:12.567 --> 00:23:15.229]  I know Savage was saying he'd like to see somebody go down there.
[00:23:15.269 --> 00:23:16.971]  So you guys may be popping in with him today.
[00:23:17.711 --> 00:23:20.954]  But you just heard what Wayne Madsen had to say.
[00:23:21.134 --> 00:23:24.096]  I know that you also have gotten an interview with at least one of the judges.
[00:23:24.717 --> 00:23:26.478]  So thank you so much for joining us, David Knight.
[00:23:27.557 --> 00:23:28.938]  David Knight, InfoWars.com.
[00:23:28.958 --> 00:23:30.379]  We're here in Marfa, Texas.
[00:23:30.419 --> 00:23:33.862]  Behind me, the pink building that you see there, is the county building.
[00:23:33.902 --> 00:23:43.649]  We tried to talk to the judge there that pronounced Scalia dead without seeing him, but earlier in the day, we went down to the judge that was called first, Juanita Bishop.
[00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.451]  We talked to her and asked her
[00:23:46.423 --> 00:23:48.205]  Why didn't you do it over the phone?
[00:23:48.265 --> 00:23:54.269]  In other words, you know, the obvious thing here, Alex, that everybody is talking about is she said, well, she made a comment.
[00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:56.932]  I would have had an autopsy done.
[00:23:56.952 --> 00:23:57.612]  I would have looked at that.
[00:23:57.832 --> 00:23:59.794]  But of course, she also would have gone.
[00:24:00.504 --> 00:24:05.986]  She got the call first, and she said she was too far away, so she called another judge, who is David Beebe.
[00:24:06.226 --> 00:24:16.689]  He was also too far away, so then they called this third judge, Cinderella Guevara, whose offices are behind us, and she did it all over the phone.
[00:24:16.729 --> 00:24:18.930]  So why wouldn't these other two not do it over the phone?
[00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:21.851]  And of course, the answer to that is that they would
[00:24:22.768 --> 00:24:24.369]  Be more careful about what they're doing.
[00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:27.910]  Alex, we have the presumption of innocence for individuals.
[00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:29.811]  You're presumed innocent until you're proven guilty.
[00:24:29.831 --> 00:24:31.731]  Of course, we've lost that now in America.
[00:24:31.771 --> 00:24:33.172]  We've turned everything upside down.
[00:24:33.672 --> 00:24:38.634]  All individuals are suspect by our government, but our government is never suspected of anything.
[00:24:39.014 --> 00:24:42.735]  And that's what these people who are looking at it, these retired police officers, are saying.
[00:24:43.076 --> 00:24:44.716]  You don't let this go.
[00:24:44.776 --> 00:24:48.277]  You assume that it is a homicide until proven otherwise.
[00:24:48.337 --> 00:24:49.498]  And that's the real issue here.
[00:24:49.858 --> 00:24:53.481]  That's right, and these top police detectives around the country, including D.C.
[00:24:53.501 --> 00:25:02.528]  detectives, you name it, who are over, in some cases, the entire squads, the entire group, are saying, you never do this, because we don't even have names.
[00:25:02.568 --> 00:25:03.849]  It's a phone call at first.
[00:25:04.109 --> 00:25:05.110]  The story changes.
[00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:06.371]  There's a pillow on the head.
[00:25:06.751 --> 00:25:10.774]  And the fact that they act like it's weird that we ask these questions is suspicious.
[00:25:11.055 --> 00:25:16.439]  And the police go on to say, and what's weirder is, the media is not asking questions.
[00:25:16.579 --> 00:25:18.961]  I mean, this thing stinks to high heaven, David Knight.
[00:25:19.735 --> 00:25:22.197]  Well, there's a lot of issues here, Alex, that we're trying to get answers to.
[00:25:22.237 --> 00:25:26.480]  For example, these calls started going, you know, first to Juanita Bishop.
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.722]  She got the call around 1 o'clock, and then they talked to the other judges.
[00:25:30.063 --> 00:25:32.525]  So, from 1 o'clock until 3 a.m.
[00:25:32.545 --> 00:25:36.147]  the next morning, which is 14 hours, they had that amount of time.
[00:25:36.508 --> 00:25:39.630]  By that time, they knew who they were dealing with.
[00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:48.295]  Somebody made the decision that even though a Supreme Court justice died alone, they were not going to do an investigation, they were not going to do an autopsy.
[00:25:48.335 --> 00:25:49.536]  We want to know who did that.
[00:25:49.596 --> 00:25:50.696]  Who was making that decision?
[00:25:50.957 --> 00:25:52.297]  You've got four different individuals.
[00:25:52.357 --> 00:25:53.998]  Oh, but there's no investigation.
[00:25:54.078 --> 00:25:56.300]  The media, the local police won't do it.
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:57.500]  I think so.
[00:26:14.096 --> 00:26:22.181]  Well, the interesting thing is, is that Boindexter, the accounts that we have seen, that have been by mainstream media, have said that he contacted the federal agencies.
[00:26:22.381 --> 00:26:26.864]  Said he had a lot of trouble getting a hold of people in federal agencies because it was a Saturday.
[00:26:27.124 --> 00:26:28.585]  But eventually he did get a hold of people.
[00:26:28.625 --> 00:26:31.667]  He said the feds flew in with a helicopter, so forth and so on.
[00:26:31.968 --> 00:26:32.328]  And yet,
[00:26:32.955 --> 00:26:46.726]  We're being told that the decisions about phoning in this death certificate and all the assumptions that were made about this body without ever having seen it were on the basis of a sheriff's deputy talking to Cinderella Guevara.
[00:26:46.806 --> 00:26:48.267]  So we want to know what's going on.
[00:26:48.307 --> 00:26:52.150]  You've got the Cinderella Guevara, you've got the sheriff, you've got the U.S.
[00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:56.153]  Marshals, and then of course you have the family which is also involved in this.
[00:26:56.493 --> 00:26:59.876]  Who made the decision that there wasn't going to be an autopsy
[00:27:00.396 --> 00:27:01.537]  When was that decision made?
[00:27:01.557 --> 00:27:11.901]  They had 14 hours from the time that they started calling the judges until the body arrived in El Paso and that was the point at which the body was embalmed.
[00:27:11.961 --> 00:27:15.943]  And there wasn't even a discussion ever about having an autopsy.
[00:27:16.023 --> 00:27:17.264]  Normally that'd be all over the news.
[00:27:17.644 --> 00:27:17.844]  Yes.
[00:27:17.904 --> 00:27:19.905]  But they'd act weird if you even asked for that.
[00:27:20.933 --> 00:27:26.658]  Well, you know, the amazing thing is, it's always suspicious when a judge, at any level, gets killed.
[00:27:27.038 --> 00:27:33.945]  Because judges sit in a position where they make decisions that can destroy people's lives.
[00:27:34.025 --> 00:27:36.347]  And so they make a lot of enemies in the course of their work.
[00:27:36.767 --> 00:27:43.734]  But when you've got a Supreme Court Justice, this Supreme Court Justice is deciding the life and death of entire industries.
[00:27:43.994 --> 00:27:47.117]  He's deciding the life and death of global agendas.
[00:27:47.297 --> 00:27:47.798]  Exactly.
[00:27:48.158 --> 00:27:51.641]  And as a matter of fact, he just had a decision like that a few days before he died.
[00:27:51.661 --> 00:27:53.923]  And he said, no, we're not shutting down all the carbon plants.
[00:27:54.344 --> 00:27:56.426]  No, we're going to defend the Second Amendment.
[00:27:56.506 --> 00:27:57.607]  No, we're going to control the border.
[00:27:57.967 --> 00:27:59.669]  No, we're not going to let the TPP run everything.
[00:27:59.709 --> 00:28:00.329]  And they went, oh really?
[00:28:00.349 --> 00:28:00.670]  You're dead.
[00:28:01.601 --> 00:28:02.722]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:28:03.082 --> 00:28:04.442]  That is what is very suspicious.
[00:28:04.742 --> 00:28:18.909]  Because you've got him being involved in something that is not only shutting the coal industry down, but that decision that they made to put a stay on Obama's EPA orders to take down the coal industry also had massive impacts on their whole climate change agenda.
[00:28:18.989 --> 00:28:23.131]  So that decision wasn't just of national importance, it was of international importance.
[00:28:23.191 --> 00:28:30.380]  And the globalists, according to the Financial Times of London, have spent more than $60 billion the last 20 years pushing the global warming carbon tax bull.
[00:28:30.861 --> 00:28:32.283]  And he just shot it down.
[00:28:32.603 --> 00:28:37.690]  And so maybe it's just a message to the rest of the court, you do what you're told, or you're going to end up with a pillow over your head.
[00:28:38.826 --> 00:28:48.092]  All of that is a factor, and all of those are reasons why we shouldn't just wave our hands and say, move along, there's nothing to see here, I'm sure this is all innocent.
[00:28:48.632 --> 00:28:53.695]  Yeah, he went to a doctor, the doctor did a MRI because he was complaining about a shoulder pain.
[00:28:54.355 --> 00:28:59.358]  That and the fact that he's 79 years old doesn't mean that it is necessarily natural causes.
[00:28:59.378 --> 00:29:00.399]  That's what we want to ask them.
[00:29:00.439 --> 00:29:02.420]  What made you think it was natural causes?
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.161]  Why would you dismiss any other doctor?
[00:29:04.201 --> 00:29:06.202]  I went to a doctor a few months ago for my shoulders.
[00:29:06.222 --> 00:29:07.243]  Does that mean I'm going to drop dead?
[00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:14.173]  And of course he wasn't feeling bad enough that he wouldn't make the trip all the way out here to this remote area to go quail hunting.
[00:29:14.614 --> 00:29:17.095]  So he obviously was not in that bad a condition.
[00:29:18.769 --> 00:29:39.738]  Look, I don't want to just sit here and say it looked like they killed him, but I mean, the way it just instantly came out, nothing happened, go to sleep, and then there'll be no autopsy, and then the story changed, he had a heart attack, didn't have a heart attack, somebody called me on the phone and said it was a heart attack, then it wasn't a heart attack, I mean, can this judge, can she, like, fix airplane equipment without a degree?
[00:29:39.778 --> 00:29:41.759]  Can she be a rocket scientist, a doctor?
[00:29:41.779 --> 00:29:44.320]  I mean, are we going to have her run nuclear reactors now?
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.121]  I mean, she's a judge, she's not a doctor.
[00:29:48.052 --> 00:29:48.452]  That's right.
[00:29:48.532 --> 00:29:49.954]  And that's why there should have been a case.
[00:29:50.294 --> 00:30:04.987]  That's why you've got people who are retired from the District of Columbia as well as from New York City who were head of criminal divisions saying this is absolutely outrageous that a person of this stature would not have a full investigation.
[00:30:05.227 --> 00:30:08.149]  You don't come in and say there's a pronouncement of innocence here.
[00:30:08.169 --> 00:30:09.571]  I'm sure there's nothing going on here.
[00:30:09.631 --> 00:30:10.772]  That is absolutely
[00:30:11.693 --> 00:30:13.134]  That's the red flag.
[00:30:13.194 --> 00:30:14.675]  It's saying, don't look here.
[00:30:14.836 --> 00:30:22.023]  It's like if a cop pulls you over and you say, I'm not drinking, or there's not marijuana in here, or I promise I wasn't part of the bank robbery.
[00:30:22.203 --> 00:30:23.604]  They're like, get out of the car, get out of the car.
[00:30:23.624 --> 00:30:25.946]  I mean, it's ridiculously obvious.
[00:30:26.026 --> 00:30:30.631]  It's like, you know, throwing something in a trunk and slamming it when you see the cops are running and racing away.
[00:30:30.691 --> 00:30:33.213]  I mean, it is just so suspicious.
[00:30:33.914 --> 00:30:34.855]  The whole way.
[00:30:35.215 --> 00:30:35.795]  I mean, man.
[00:30:36.016 --> 00:30:43.081]  And then this guy was in like secret black ops in Vietnam and is involved in all these big CIA connected brokerage firms.
[00:30:43.121 --> 00:30:43.962]  I mean, key ones.
[00:30:44.342 --> 00:30:44.722]  Key.
[00:30:45.503 --> 00:30:47.624]  Key groups in getting awards from Obama.
[00:30:48.045 --> 00:30:49.646]  I mean, oh boy, I tell you.
[00:30:50.629 --> 00:30:53.312]  This is a very elite ranch, obviously.
[00:30:53.353 --> 00:30:55.355]  That's why Scully and other celebrities are there.
[00:30:55.375 --> 00:31:01.463]  30,000 acres he has here, so yeah, he's got a lot of connections, a lot of money involved there.
[00:31:01.923 --> 00:31:06.970]  But the thing that we all need to look at, and we all need to ask questions about, how did this happen?
[00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:08.472]  How could something like this happen?
[00:31:08.928 --> 00:31:13.752]  The federal agents were involved long before the decision was made not to do an autopsy.
[00:31:13.972 --> 00:31:16.214]  Even if you've got gross incompetence... That's right.
[00:31:16.234 --> 00:31:16.915]  They were involved.
[00:31:16.955 --> 00:31:21.779]  It's federal jurisdiction because he's a federal officer and... I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:22.700]  That's right.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:29.366]  The federal agency had 14 hours before he even got to El Paso where they eventually did an embalming there.
[00:31:29.506 --> 00:31:35.971]  And Obama knew within two hours of his body being found, but the whole country didn't know until way later.
[00:31:36.031 --> 00:31:36.552]  I mean, come on.
[00:31:37.321 --> 00:31:38.821]  Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.
[00:31:39.221 --> 00:31:47.203]  And so you can look at this and you can say, okay, there's been issues with this judge in the past shutting down what people thought might have been a murder investigation.
[00:31:47.223 --> 00:31:48.883]  They say, move along, there's nothing here.
[00:31:49.123 --> 00:31:54.204]  You could talk about local incompetence, but the federal agents knew who they were dealing with.
[00:31:54.364 --> 00:31:54.584]  Sure.
[00:31:54.604 --> 00:31:56.125]  They should have shut this thing down.
[00:31:56.145 --> 00:31:57.865]  Well, let me say something about that area, okay?
[00:31:57.905 --> 00:31:59.245]  I mean, it is wild, wild west, folks.
[00:31:59.265 --> 00:32:00.425]  You want to see what the old west looked like?
[00:32:00.846 --> 00:32:01.966]  Get down to those areas.
[00:32:02.006 --> 00:32:02.646]  I mean, it's real.
[00:32:03.106 --> 00:32:04.927]  There's a lot of folks down there who want to be left alone.
[00:32:04.947 --> 00:32:08.070]  The drugs coming across the border is sensational.
[00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:15.815]  And let me just tell you point blank, if you ask me who are the most corrupt judiciary in Texas, I would say Southwest Texas on the border.
[00:32:16.356 --> 00:32:21.700]  Okay, some of the best folks are out West, but down there, I don't care if they're white, Hispanic, whatever, it runs across the board.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:29.645]  It is super corrupt, Tombstone, Arizona style, and just a perfect place to have a 30,000 acre ranch too, by the way.
[00:32:29.865 --> 00:32:30.266]  We'll be back.
[00:32:40.714 --> 00:32:41.234]  What's wrong?
[00:32:41.895 --> 00:32:45.316]  You don't like a small group of psychos hijacking your country?
[00:32:45.537 --> 00:32:52.520]  Well, become President of the United States and change it from the... Never mind.
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:57.743]  Three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:32:57.763 --> 00:33:01.625]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[00:33:14.893 --> 00:33:17.355]  This is Bernie Sanders and I'm quite upset.
[00:33:17.555 --> 00:33:24.298]  If you guys saw the Iowa Caucus the other night, you would know that I worked extremely hard for these votes.
[00:33:24.598 --> 00:33:30.761]  And the people that were working in the Iowa Caucus took what I worked hard for and gave it to someone else.
[00:33:31.081 --> 00:33:36.063]  A lying, cheating, horrible human being by the name of Hillary Clinton.
[00:33:38.244 --> 00:33:42.146]  I don't understand how anybody could like something like this.
[00:33:42.226 --> 00:33:54.492]  That you work hard for something your whole life and you earn something and then you're expected to give it to someone else who's not as deserving and is too lazy or more of a piece of crap than you are.
[00:33:54.632 --> 00:33:57.613]  What kind of person would even think about something like that?
[00:33:57.873 --> 00:34:01.235]  Hey, that'd be you, Bernie Sanders.
[00:34:01.475 --> 00:34:02.536]  Guess you just felt the Bern.
[00:34:03.656 --> 00:34:06.657]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.

[00:34:53.069 --> 00:34:54.110]  We're good to go.
[00:35:12.617 --> 00:35:18.719]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:35:18.759 --> 00:35:20.020]  The police are shoving people.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:20.860]  Shoving Alex.
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:22.041]  Shoving the crowd.
[00:35:22.061 --> 00:35:22.881]  Here we go, folks.
[00:35:22.941 --> 00:35:23.801]  I'm being assaulted.
[00:35:23.841 --> 00:35:30.104]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:35:30.204 --> 00:35:36.106]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:35:36.246 --> 00:35:40.028]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.

[00:36:45.768 --> 00:36:48.969]  You know
[00:37:06.118 --> 00:37:26.041]  Socialist presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is wildly popular with the youth and we keep scratching our heads saying how in the world do people not understand that there's no way for Bernie Sanders to pay for his 18 trillion dollar plan that he has laid out over the next 10 years is going to cost us 18 trillion.
[00:37:26.321 --> 00:37:26.782]  We already
[00:37:27.322 --> 00:37:27.522]  Okay.
[00:37:49.042 --> 00:37:53.766]  100% taxes for the 1%, you still would not be able to cover this $18 trillion debt.
[00:37:54.286 --> 00:38:10.379]  And so we're wondering, you know, who are these students who are saying, we want free college, we don't know how we're going to pay for it, but we want free college, and we want a $15 minimum wage, even though we're watching videos of companies letting 1,500 employees know that they're getting their jobs shipped
[00:38:10.839 --> 00:38:26.267]  To Mexico, that they'll be out of work, and there aren't any jobs for people, but let's go ahead and raise the minimum wage and let's just all continue to live in this delusional reality that those workers are not going to be replaced with lower wage workers.
[00:38:26.768 --> 00:38:39.915]  Well, now we've got an article coming out that kind of explains, you know, why these young people who probably have never had a job where they earn more than $10 an hour, why they are really feeling the burn.
[00:38:40.615 --> 00:38:42.216]  Now this comes out of the Gateway Pundit.
[00:38:42.356 --> 00:38:49.301]  He says Bernie Sanders was a bum who didn't earn a steady paycheck until he was 40 years old.
[00:38:49.821 --> 00:38:55.525]  Now the socialist has wormed his way into politics and this is coming from Investors Business Daily.
[00:38:55.865 --> 00:39:04.531]  Okay, so they're reporting about how Sanders spent most of his life as an angry radical and agitator who never accomplished much of anything.
[00:39:04.831 --> 00:39:10.075]  Yet now he thinks he deserves the power to run your life and your finances.
[00:39:10.695 --> 00:39:13.658]  One of his first jobs was registering people for food stamps.
[00:39:14.359 --> 00:39:19.804]  Then Sanders took his first bride to live in a maple sugar shack with a dirt floor.
[00:39:20.264 --> 00:39:21.405]  She soon left him.
[00:39:22.006 --> 00:39:24.068]  Penniless, he went on unemployment.
[00:39:25.689 --> 00:39:25.749]  And
[00:39:46.829 --> 00:39:49.090]  Car, no working windshield wipers.
[00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:56.193]  His friends, these are his friends, saying that he was always poor and his electricity was turned off a lot.
[00:39:56.253 --> 00:39:59.094]  They described him as a slob who kept a messy apartment.
[00:39:59.475 --> 00:40:07.278]  So it sort of sounds a lot like a lot of these people who I imagine have these delusions of $15 minimum wage, free college.
[00:40:07.678 --> 00:40:13.781]  And of course now Bernie Sanders is working his way into politics where he's talking about redistributing your wealth.
[00:40:14.401 --> 00:40:15.682]  And that's what his friends say.
[00:40:15.762 --> 00:40:17.264]  He always did very, very good.
[00:40:17.984 --> 00:40:24.810]  He was always very good at talking nonstop about socialism and how the rich were ripping everybody off.
[00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:34.398]  And I know a lot of these people out there, we have a lot of them here in Austin, Texas, who have this same sort of ideology because they don't want to work.
[00:40:34.538 --> 00:40:37.121]  They don't want to go out there and pay for school.
[00:40:37.461 --> 00:40:39.823]  Like I, you know, I'm saddled with a lot of debt.
[00:40:40.143 --> 00:40:51.147]  What are they going to do for people like us, who we've paid our dues, we're paying our taxes, paying a lot in taxes, frankly, and paying a lot in health care to cover the costs of those who cannot pay for their health care?
[00:40:51.647 --> 00:40:53.807]  What are they going to do for people who are saddled with debt?
[00:40:54.087 --> 00:40:59.929]  Well, if you are one of those people, you better pay your student loan debt off, because now we have the U.S.
[00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:06.391]  Marshal Service arresting people who do not pay their outstanding federal student loans.
[00:41:06.831 --> 00:41:08.292]  Jakari Jackson has more.
[00:41:09.696 --> 00:41:12.917]  It seems as though you can get arrested for just about anything these days.
[00:41:13.357 --> 00:41:18.078]  Back in 2013, it made national news when a man was arrested for an overdue library book.
[00:41:18.618 --> 00:41:27.239]  Police were called to the man's apartment on an unrelated disturbance charge and arrested him after finding that he had a past warrant for an unreturned GED study guide.
[00:41:27.719 --> 00:41:31.140]  He was released on a $200 bond and then requested time served.
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:36.321]  He has since returned the book but said that he couldn't bring it back initially because he was in prison.
[00:41:37.369 --> 00:41:41.710]  Look, if you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you better think again.
[00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:44.951]  This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped.
[00:41:45.271 --> 00:41:47.571]  Or, maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld.
[00:41:47.971 --> 00:41:49.192]  Maybe that's how you get your kicks.
[00:41:49.512 --> 00:41:50.892]  You and your good time buddies.
[00:41:51.092 --> 00:41:53.693]  Well, I got a flash for you, joy boy.
[00:41:58.234 --> 00:41:59.174]  Party time is over.
[00:42:00.569 --> 00:42:03.151]  Now we have a story that's debatably just as ridiculous.
[00:42:03.652 --> 00:42:03.852]  U.S.
[00:42:03.912 --> 00:42:07.235]  Marshals arresting people for not paying federal student loans.
[00:42:07.615 --> 00:42:15.121]  And this is the story of Paul Aker, who says he was arrested at his home last week for a $1,500 federal student loan he received back in 1987.
[00:42:17.383 --> 00:42:18.063]  What did you think?
[00:42:18.363 --> 00:42:19.264]  There is a U.S.
[00:42:19.344 --> 00:42:24.106]  Marshals Service knocking on your door for a $1,500 student loan.
[00:42:24.447 --> 00:42:25.987]  I was wondering, why are you here?
[00:42:26.007 --> 00:42:30.810]  I'm home, I haven't done anything, and why are the marshals knocking on my door?
[00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:32.551]  It's amazing.
[00:42:32.731 --> 00:42:36.913]  Now you were arrested, you were in shackles, you were in handcuffs, and where did they take you?
[00:42:37.053 --> 00:42:39.294]  They took me downtown to the federal court.
[00:42:40.216 --> 00:42:46.200]  So whether it's an overdue library book or a student loan, let this be a lesson to all you college kids who owe a hell of a lot more than $1,500.
[00:42:46.961 --> 00:42:50.644]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:42:51.849 --> 00:42:55.531]  One place where we do see a lot of government waste is Veterans Affairs.
[00:42:55.651 --> 00:43:00.593]  And now some really disturbing news coming out of a 2015 inspection.
[00:43:00.953 --> 00:43:06.375]  Suicidal veterans were calling the VA crisis hotline and they were sent to voicemail.
[00:43:06.835 --> 00:43:12.218]  This was almost two dozen people who called the VA's suicide hotline in fiscal year 2014.
[00:43:12.778 --> 00:43:14.619]  They heard nothing but a voicemail message.
[00:43:15.319 --> 00:43:21.041]  And this was substantiated after an Inspector General investigation was launched in early 2015.
[00:43:21.181 --> 00:43:24.483]  They yielded some unfortunate results.
[00:43:25.003 --> 00:43:30.865]  First is the fact that the veterans on the verge of suicide had their calls picked up by a voicemail service.
[00:43:31.285 --> 00:43:42.490]  The second failure determined that the VA has no idea if hotline contractors were even trained counselors who could adequately handle mental health issues.
[00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:44.791]  And they say what's even worse than that?
[00:43:45.271 --> 00:43:54.697]  Is the fact that the staff had no idea a voicemail messaging system even existed, so naturally they failed to return these people's phone calls.
[00:43:55.298 --> 00:44:00.782]  Now the VA has until September 30th to implement a set of changes that's been recommended by the Inspector General.
[00:44:01.242 --> 00:44:14.531]  This includes hiring more staff, upgrading equipment, and get this, the VA is also required to rewrite some contracts to make sure that the contractors actually have expectations that they must meet.
[00:44:15.111 --> 00:44:19.054]  So they don't even have a set standard for expectations.
[00:44:19.375 --> 00:44:23.498]  How do they even gauge the performance of a lot of these guys working there?
[00:44:23.898 --> 00:44:30.424]  Again, a government waste, and yet Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, they want the government to be even bigger.
[00:44:30.944 --> 00:44:34.107]  Meanwhile, they haven't fixed the government that we have that's in place.
[00:44:34.707 --> 00:44:44.733]  Now one group that's also facing some budget cuts there has been running their government a little bit too willy-nilly is ISIS.
[00:44:45.214 --> 00:44:47.255]  That's right, they're facing a budget crunch.
[00:44:47.555 --> 00:44:50.937]  They're having to cut their perks and trim salaries.
[00:44:51.297 --> 00:44:57.061]  So this is after they're being faced with a cash shortage in the so-called caliphate.
[00:44:57.481 --> 00:45:00.065]  This is due to airstrikes and other measures.
[00:45:00.405 --> 00:45:02.208]  They've had to slash their salaries.
[00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:07.155]  They're asking residents to pay utility bills in black market American dollars.
[00:45:07.696 --> 00:45:10.721]  And now they're releasing detainees for a price of $500 a person.
[00:45:13.004 --> 00:45:16.387]  So these are extremists who once bragged about minting their own currency.
[00:45:17.007 --> 00:45:24.893]  And they gained a lot of loyalty building up their militants by giving them good salaries and they would give them honeymoon and baby bonuses.
[00:45:25.253 --> 00:45:32.899]  But now they've even had to cut back on even the smallest perks, which is free energy drinks and Snickers bars.
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.241]  But it's not just their militants.
[00:45:35.462 --> 00:45:38.745]  It's anyone that's a civil servant from the courts to the schools.
[00:45:38.765 --> 00:45:41.227]  They've all had their salary cut by 50 percent.
[00:45:42.028 --> 00:45:42.468]  The U.S.
[00:45:42.508 --> 00:45:48.013]  government could actually learn a thing from this terrorist organization about how to balance a budget, apparently.
[00:45:48.493 --> 00:45:52.437]  Well, coming up after the break, we're going to have a really great report by John Bowne.
[00:45:52.717 --> 00:45:53.918]  He also is questioning
[00:45:54.799 --> 00:45:58.882]  Why there is so much controversy around Justice Scalia's death?
[00:45:59.262 --> 00:46:07.689]  Why didn't he get an autopsy when there are mandatory autopsies for any illegal alien that is found dead at the border?
[00:46:17.202 --> 00:46:21.345]  You traitors claiming I'm a Ruski agent, say it to my face and I'll break your nose.
[00:46:21.565 --> 00:46:22.226]  I'm sick of it.
[00:46:22.486 --> 00:46:25.468]  I will stomp your head in the ground, you traitorous maggots.
[00:46:25.729 --> 00:46:38.939]  While we go under Obamacare, North American Union, conquered by European banks, announcing our kids don't belong to us, total bondage, total surveillance, and you want to shoot your mouth off about me being a Ruski agent, I will stomp your head in the ground.
[00:46:39.159 --> 00:46:44.881]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 proof.
[00:46:45.341 --> 00:46:49.223]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:46:50.744 --> 00:46:56.406]  I wish we'd go back to the days, I'm telling you, of getting my satisfaction out in the street.
[00:46:57.435 --> 00:47:00.377]  You pick a sword or something else, you're going down the street.
[00:47:00.817 --> 00:47:02.719]  I'm not kidding, you cowardly scum!
[00:47:02.999 --> 00:47:04.019]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:06.821]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.121 --> 00:47:14.947]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.228 --> 00:48:43.308]  Unfortunately, you've grown up.
[00:49:06.636 --> 00:49:14.561]  Hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[00:49:14.902 --> 00:49:17.123]  It's time to stop submitting to this tyranny!
[00:49:17.263 --> 00:49:19.405]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[00:49:20.025 --> 00:49:22.807]  Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works.
[00:49:24.328 --> 00:49:27.030]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:30.772]  Tyranny with a capital T. You should reject these voices.
[00:49:31.573 --> 00:49:32.874]  Everything that's been done
[00:49:34.073 --> 00:49:50.586]  With torture, vendition, the NDAA, the Patriot Acts 1 and 2, from day one, was focused on the American people, period.
[00:49:51.987 --> 00:49:52.408]  That's it.
[00:49:53.559 --> 00:50:02.087]  It's always been about erasing the Bill of Rights and Constitution and rolling out NSA spying publicly, saying it's for Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:02.527 --> 00:50:06.591]  Rolling out torture, saying it's for Al-Qaeda, but it's really for the general public.
[00:50:06.951 --> 00:50:15.539]  Rolling out total control and the end of any underground free market systems in the name of fighting Al-Qaeda, but really shutting down any type of free commerce.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.962]  This is all about converting us
[00:50:18.502 --> 00:50:24.019]  From a free society to a tyranny with a capital T.
[00:51:01.367 --> 00:51:02.128]  Or to any of us.
[00:51:02.148 --> 00:51:03.108]  We have life tenure.
[00:51:03.489 --> 00:51:08.011]  And we have it precisely so that we will not be influenced by politics.
[00:51:08.632 --> 00:51:10.233]  By threats from anybody.
[00:51:12.654 --> 00:51:13.295]  What the hell is this?
[00:51:13.675 --> 00:51:14.876]  It's a Sicilian message.
[00:51:15.595 --> 00:51:16.475]  I mean, it's a little compressed.
[00:51:16.495 --> 00:51:17.516]  He sleeps with the fishers.
[00:51:17.856 --> 00:51:24.417]  Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia was appointed in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan.
[00:51:24.557 --> 00:51:35.400]  Scalia served as a safeguard for the Constitution, a staunch opponent to the liberal viewpoint that the Constitution is a living document to be interpreted by progressive demands.
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:38.401]  Scalia held true to his beliefs as an originalist.
[00:51:38.681 --> 00:51:39.162]  I don't know.
[00:51:55.140 --> 00:52:03.069]  Clearly this viewpoint counters President Obama's quasi-progressive conquest to fundamentally transform the United States.
[00:52:03.329 --> 00:52:08.956]  Obama's violation of the Constitution is a constant, even as he faces a lame-duck presidency.
[00:52:09.376 --> 00:52:10.838]  But with Scalia gone,
[00:52:11.218 --> 00:52:26.063]  And the possibility of Obama's free speech assailing lackey, Loretta Lynch, receiving the Supreme Court nomination, Obama could find himself in the driver's seat once again, making tracks down the road to tyranny before his term ends.
[00:52:26.523 --> 00:52:36.566]  Scalia's swing vote on the issues including abortion clinic closures in Texas, a public sector union fair share fee ruling, a University of Texas affirmative action case,
[00:52:36.906 --> 00:52:50.755]  And Obamacare's violation of religious freedom via no-cost access to birth control for religious non-profits were small potatoes compared to the two cases causing the treasonous Obama administration to sweat.
[00:52:51.155 --> 00:52:59.220]  First, with Scalia gone, Obama's shielding of 4 million illegal aliens only needs one conservative vote to sway to the liberal side.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:00.241]  We're good to go.
[00:53:20.299 --> 00:53:21.559]  The liberal D.C.
[00:53:21.699 --> 00:53:29.242]  Circuit Court ruling could serve it up to an Obama-dominated Supreme Court, signed, sealed and delivered before Obama leaves office.
[00:53:29.522 --> 00:53:39.085]  Obama claims he won't use the nuclear option and appoint a justice while the Senate is in recess, although he does have a small window to appoint a temporary replacement.
[00:53:39.285 --> 00:53:45.567]  And as we all know, when Obama says he will not do or sign something, that usually means he will.
[00:53:46.087 --> 00:53:53.908]  Unfortunately for Obama though, two years ago the Supreme Court weakened the President's ability to use the nuclear option power.
[00:53:54.249 --> 00:53:59.409]  Upon hearing Scalia's death due to natural causes, most people brushed it off.
[00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:01.210]  He was 79 years old.
[00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:04.050]  But then the fumbling of the details began.
[00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:12.832]  Presidio County Judge Cinderella Guevara pronounced Scalia dead due to natural causes without seeing the body or even ordering an autopsy.
[00:54:13.192 --> 00:54:24.060]  If you believe that, we ought to go back to monarchy, that the people are such sheep that they just swallow whatever they see on television or read in the newspapers.
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:40.232]  And the highly decorated Vietnam veteran and prized Democratic Party donor and Cibolo Creek Ranch owner, John Poindexter, continually changed his story until he finally blurted out that Scalia was found with a pillow over his head and the sheets were unwrinkled.
[00:54:40.512 --> 00:54:47.335]  The Washington Post reports, quote, William O. Ritchie, a former commander and former head of criminal investigations for D.C.
[00:54:47.395 --> 00:54:52.436]  police, wrote, You have a Supreme Court justice who died, not in attendance of a physician.
[00:54:52.737 --> 00:54:54.957]  You have a non-homicide trained U.S.
[00:54:55.017 --> 00:54:59.099]  marshal tell the justice of the peace that no foul play was observed.
[00:54:59.319 --> 00:55:09.723]  You have a justice of the peace pronounce death while not being on the scene and without any medical training opining that the justice died of a heart attack.
[00:55:10.183 --> 00:55:13.346]  What medical proof exists of a myocardial infarction?
[00:55:13.706 --> 00:55:15.668]  Why not a cerebral hemorrhage?
[00:55:16.348 --> 00:55:16.929]  End quote.
[00:55:17.229 --> 00:55:25.656]  Any signs of strangulation uncovered by a mandatory standard autopsy, such as patechial hemorrhage, would have sounded off alarm bells.
[00:55:25.876 --> 00:55:31.160]  Yet an autopsy of one of the most powerful people in the United States was neglected.
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:39.207]  Meanwhile, towns like Falfurious, Texas shell out money they don't have to perform autopsies on illegal aliens.
[00:55:39.827 --> 00:55:59.639]  The meager funds that Brooks County accumulates from their property taxes and funds given to them by the state of Texas and not the federal government go here to bury undocumented migrants crossing illegally across the border just 60 miles south a day's walk
[00:56:00.506 --> 00:56:02.267]  To their deaths of dehydration.
[00:56:02.587 --> 00:56:04.828]  The effective tax rate cannot exceed 80 cents.
[00:56:05.588 --> 00:56:08.909]  And the effective tax rate at that time would have been 97 cents.
[00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:11.790]  So we had to reduce our budget by 17 cents.
[00:56:12.811 --> 00:56:14.832]  Because it cannot go over that, and that's by law.
[00:56:15.712 --> 00:56:34.021]  Compounded by the amount that we spend, and that figure is dealing with autopsies, it's dealing with the wear and tear of the vehicles, the sheriff's department, the JP's, the magistrates, the death certificates, all the paperwork that's entailed, getting out to these areas that are very, very remote.
[00:56:34.881 --> 00:56:41.546]  I personally have been taken to pronounce a body when the police, the sheriff officer with me says, oh, there went the transmission.
[00:56:41.886 --> 00:56:53.215]  Currently, it may not appear that Scalia's suspicious end at a West Texas resort amounts to much to the average citizen, 32% of which have never even heard of him, according to a Gallup poll.
[00:56:53.515 --> 00:57:03.282]  But in the months to come, if all goes well for Obama by way of a corporacratic faux Republican majority in Congress and Obama's go-it-alone approach to the executive office,
[00:57:03.562 --> 00:57:18.493]  Scalia's death will be regarded as the final nail to be driven into the Federal Republic of the United States as Obama transforms the United States into a unitary republic, legally ruled by an all-powerful central government.
