[00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:18.996]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:19.596 --> 00:00:22.637]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.019]  I'm not saying this because I support Donald Trump.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.541]  I support Donald Trump, quite frankly, at certain levels, holding my nose.
[00:00:42.941 --> 00:00:44.322]  I say this because it's the truth.
[00:00:45.162 --> 00:00:48.664]  Ted Cruz and the people running him are awful, horrible people.
[00:00:49.745 --> 00:00:55.388]  I think Ted Cruz is very smart, very eloquent, but don't they say the last psychopaths are?
[00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.572]  The things he's doing, the things he's saying are so deceptive.
[00:01:03.153 --> 00:01:12.078]  If you go to my Twitter from two days ago, I have a screenshot of the Drudge Report where it says, election canceled.
[00:01:13.928 --> 00:01:15.909]  No primary, no voters needed.
[00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:29.034]  That is such an over-the-top bombshell event in Colorado and now other states that the Republicans are announcing aren't going to have elections in the primary.
[00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:32.015]  I mean, that's what happened.
[00:01:32.995 --> 00:01:35.636]  Fury is Colorado has no primary or caucuses.
[00:01:36.116 --> 00:01:37.817]  Cruz celebrates voterless victory.
[00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:47.498]  Cruz came out, there's two different clips, and made fun of everybody and said, silly people, this is democracy.
[00:01:47.518 --> 00:01:48.539]  I'm gonna play the clip.
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:03.385]  And he then came out and said that Matt Drudge is an attack site for Donald Trump and that basically is commanded around by Roger Stone.
[00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:06.726]  Those two don't even talk to each other.
[00:02:10.916 --> 00:02:20.218]  No, when Matt Drudge sees the Republicans say they're going to take delegates away from the winner and then just cancel elections, it's a big deal.
[00:02:21.298 --> 00:02:31.340]  And they can sit up there with their arrogance like they're a corrupt homeowners association or something, announcing that they own your house because you had a bottle cap in your yard or something.
[00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:34.321]  These are people who are delusional.
[00:02:36.024 --> 00:02:45.935]  And think because they, quote, make the rules that they can make the rules that they're permanent rulers of the country who appoint who can run for president.
[00:02:46.736 --> 00:02:50.861]  If the two parties appoint who can run for president, then you have a two-party dictatorship.
[00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.980]  That's why you suddenly see Obama on Fox News for the first time in eight years.
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.741]  That's why you see the merger.
[00:02:58.541 --> 00:03:01.202]  Fox News announcing a few months ago they're going to be nice to Hillary now.
[00:03:02.022 --> 00:03:08.105]  This is the two parties merging to take down populist movements in America and complete their takeover.
[00:03:11.766 --> 00:03:19.189]  Now, a few months ago, back when Drudge was saying nice things and linking to nice things,
[00:03:20.256 --> 00:03:21.597]  That Ted Cruz was doing.
[00:03:22.698 --> 00:03:28.684]  Cruz came out and said that Drudge had killed the mainstream media and that he was the future and that he was so wonderful.
[00:03:29.164 --> 00:03:30.325]  I've got the clip, we're gonna play it.
[00:03:31.226 --> 00:03:36.991]  But that's because Cruz wasn't doing bad things then and hadn't revealed himself.
[00:03:37.932 --> 00:03:41.816]  That was right before he robbed Carson in Iowa.
[00:03:42.436 --> 00:03:44.939]  That was right before all the other dirty tricks.
[00:03:47.281 --> 00:03:49.002]  That was before Jeb Bush endorsed him.
[00:03:49.703 --> 00:04:01.731]  That was before in Louisiana and Tennessee and all these other states, Trump wins and they take the delegates and say, well, we're allowed to because we made superdelegates.
[00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:05.713]  We voted for this 40 years ago, but we didn't implement it till now.
[00:04:08.995 --> 00:04:16.961]  Well, maybe they'll just vote at the RNC to merge with the Democrats and then they'll just vote on who the president is because that's what this is one step away from.
[00:04:18.126 --> 00:04:21.267]  is a pure Central Committee slash Politburo.
[00:04:23.408 --> 00:04:27.991]  He praised the Drudge Report for quote, taking the GOP message directly to the people.
[00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:33.413]  Almost without exception, professionalism, journalists are partisan liberal Democrats.
[00:04:34.934 --> 00:04:35.654]  And he said more.
[00:04:35.914 --> 00:04:37.115]  We've got more, more clips.
[00:04:37.135 --> 00:04:39.256]  He says they've got the mainstream media, we've got Drudge.
[00:04:41.263 --> 00:04:42.364]  Now, here's what's going on.
[00:04:42.464 --> 00:04:44.265]  They're bullying everybody in talk radio.
[00:04:44.445 --> 00:04:46.727]  They've been taking me off stations all over the place for this.
[00:04:47.948 --> 00:04:54.532]  They tried to hijack and take over Eagle Forum and take over the bank account of the organization Phyllis Schlafly runs.
[00:04:55.193 --> 00:05:04.179]  So, the cruise worshippers are now mugging old ladies and the oldest living patriot conservative in America.
[00:05:05.403 --> 00:05:09.125]  I mean, are we gonna, like, drain her blood and give it to Cruz, the vampire?
[00:05:09.586 --> 00:05:10.606]  Brain Force is here.
[00:05:11.147 --> 00:05:13.428]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:21.493]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:05:22.287 --> 00:05:25.870]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.231]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:05:28.591 --> 00:05:32.114]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:05:32.154 --> 00:05:35.296]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:05:35.797 --> 00:05:40.600]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.962]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:05:43.302 --> 00:05:47.745]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:05:47.885 --> 00:05:49.906]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:05:50.527 --> 00:05:51.988]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:05:52.148 --> 00:05:52.388]  Exactly.
[00:05:52.408 --> 00:05:56.192]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:05:56.692 --> 00:06:03.978]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:06:58.373 --> 00:06:58.993]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:06:59.013 --> 00:07:03.737]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:07:17.287 --> 00:07:33.994]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running 6 miles every other day, swimming 2-3 miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalists.
[00:07:34.375 --> 00:07:38.396]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:07:42.398 --> 00:07:49.502]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:07:49.822 --> 00:07:55.525]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:07:55.666 --> 00:08:01.829]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.

[00:08:27.685 --> 00:08:34.070]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.711]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:38.173 --> 00:08:54.045]  Needless to say, my friends, I was chomping at the bit last night and this morning I vaulted out of bed at 7 o'clock this morning to get prepared and get down here to the studio.
[00:08:56.254 --> 00:09:02.861]  A lot of folks noticed that I was more focused and pretty calm yesterday for most of the three plus hours that I broadcast.
[00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:05.985]  Because the more hardcore things get, the more focused I get.
[00:09:08.407 --> 00:09:11.591]  Our analysis of the globalist takeover was very accurate.
[00:09:12.772 --> 00:09:14.314]  We're now inside the takeover.
[00:09:15.395 --> 00:09:16.356]  It's only going to get more intense.
[00:09:19.807 --> 00:09:30.340]  They are mortal enemies of Christians, veterans, patriots, gun owners, capitalists, libertarians, free marketers, free souls, free minds, people of justice.
[00:09:32.102 --> 00:09:33.023]  They're coming for us.
[00:09:33.504 --> 00:09:34.385]  We are being conquered.
[00:09:35.647 --> 00:09:38.290]  And I'm here as a modern Paul Revere raising the alarm bell.
[00:09:43.087 --> 00:09:55.390]  Every day now, crazier, over-the-top forms of corruption and open, naked, brazen, bravada-filled hubris is just spraying out.
[00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.291]  Every day now, more happens than the previous week.
[00:09:58.951 --> 00:10:01.852]  It's like a corruption singularity is taking place.
[00:10:03.632 --> 00:10:10.434]  And while we're busy, and while I'm busy covering the theft of the election,
[00:10:13.601 --> 00:10:21.204]  The cancellation of the 2016 election by both parties and the installation of the new president.
[00:10:25.526 --> 00:10:41.953]  The federal government came out two days ago and openly announced, it was in major tech publications, I mentioned it, that yes, the goal is to get humans completely out of cars within 10 years and to retrofit everything because, quote, it's going to be safer.
[00:10:44.551 --> 00:10:59.337]  And there are open announcements of global carbon taxes and world government and unelected bodies and 50, 60 hour work weeks and all these new compulsory taxes.
[00:11:00.237 --> 00:11:02.618]  This way comes something wicked.
[00:11:08.481 --> 00:11:11.602]  And the New York Times, the Providence Journal,
[00:11:12.967 --> 00:11:22.810]  Every day they have articles saying arrest people that say man-made global warming or climate change isn't real and arrest people who aren't politically correct.
[00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:23.911]  That's in the news today.
[00:11:25.811 --> 00:11:41.117]  Climate change deniers deserve punishment and rampant accelerated censorship and just open borders and five million jihadis pouring in as part of a military invasion
[00:11:42.276 --> 00:11:45.740]  Out of Syria, into Turkey, into Europe and the United States.
[00:11:46.481 --> 00:11:47.562]  A planned invasion.
[00:11:48.242 --> 00:11:57.052]  NATO didn't just invade Syria with millions of jihadis and their families, their camp followers.
[00:11:59.855 --> 00:12:04.720]  This is ancient war, like the Visigoths or the Vandals or the Huns or the Mongols.
[00:12:07.162 --> 00:12:18.346]  Would come in and conquer you, and then bring in their families behind them, shut up an outpost, have kids, and 20 years later, roll out with the next invasion force.
[00:12:20.307 --> 00:12:24.048]  That's how the Vikings took over what is Russia today more than a thousand years ago.
[00:12:25.609 --> 00:12:27.530]  They kicked the Mongols and the Huns out.
[00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:29.050]  Killed them.
[00:12:29.971 --> 00:12:30.551]  Killed them all.
[00:12:35.959 --> 00:12:40.724]  I sit here and I just look at all of this and it is mind-blowing.
[00:12:46.931 --> 00:12:49.094]  The economic issues in the backdrop.
[00:12:50.006 --> 00:12:50.266]  I think?
[00:13:06.141 --> 00:13:09.544]  Arkansas and Missouri in the Ozarks.
[00:13:09.564 --> 00:13:20.453]  I mean, some of them 30, 40,000 square feet with five foot thick concrete walls, machine gun nests, helicopter pads and underground bases.
[00:13:21.454 --> 00:13:22.295]  That's in the news.
[00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:29.821]  And armored fortresses all over the Caribbean and all over the Pacific and all over the Cook Islands and all over Australia and New Zealand.
[00:13:31.002 --> 00:13:33.964]  I was told by Hollywood folks seven years ago there was an exodus
[00:13:34.952 --> 00:13:41.117]  To New Zealand, and then you started seeing it in the news, and now they admit they didn't go there to set up production companies, they went there to escape.
[00:13:46.422 --> 00:13:47.302]  Economic collapse?
[00:13:47.663 --> 00:13:48.423]  World War III?
[00:13:49.964 --> 00:13:50.905]  It's all in the cards.
[00:13:51.125 --> 00:13:51.706]  Race war?
[00:13:51.726 --> 00:13:53.948]  It's all in the cards.
[00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.012]  It's a death-defying stunt for me to stay in this country.
[00:14:03.015 --> 00:14:06.437]  But it's worth it for humanity, and I'm not backing down.
[00:14:07.497 --> 00:14:08.678]  Fortune favors the bold.
[00:14:09.058 --> 00:14:10.739]  The fortune I'm looking for is liberty in our time.
[00:14:10.759 --> 00:14:14.281]  But let me tell you, these are the times that try men's souls.
[00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:29.308]  And to sit here and watch the general public still in a trance, having no idea what's about to hit them, is like watching a two-year-old toddler run out into a major highway, and there's cars coming and going 80 miles an hour.
[00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:32.810]  And that toddler ain't gonna know what hit him.
[00:14:38.632 --> 00:14:41.533]  I've seen like a five-year-old run over dead in the road, something you never forget.
[00:14:41.553 --> 00:14:55.079]  Saw a Corvette flip and fly off the highway one time, going about 150 and saw all the people in the air as I was driving about 75 up as they were flipping to the air and arms and legs and body parts being chopped off, pulled over, blood spraying everywhere.
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.260]  Kind of stuff you don't forget.
[00:14:59.718 --> 00:15:07.731]  It was like in slow motion watching that Corvette fly through the guardrail and spin on its nose and spin into pieces with people flying out like a, like a tornado.
[00:15:09.254 --> 00:15:13.641]  Shoots past me, goes in front of a bunch of cars, has a blowout it looks like, flips.
[00:15:15.626 --> 00:15:15.866]  I don't
[00:15:38.357 --> 00:15:40.419]  Run security when they round up all the patriots.
[00:15:40.739 --> 00:15:41.700]  Oh, man!
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.782]  Oh, man!
[00:15:44.642 --> 00:15:49.767]  Oh, they tried to do a coup on Phyllis Schlafly and take over her whole operation and seize her bank account.
[00:15:51.228 --> 00:15:55.812]  Oh, they're talking about shutting Drudge down and they're starting to arrest filmmakers.
[00:15:56.112 --> 00:15:56.873]  Oh, no!
[00:15:56.893 --> 00:16:06.441]  Oh, they're in the news calling for Roger Stone's arrest and they're now discussing my arrest for saying we dare protest peacefully the stealing of the delegates.
[00:16:09.554 --> 00:16:11.575]  But if you look at history, this is just the way it works.
[00:16:11.675 --> 00:16:12.735]  This is the way it goes down.
[00:16:12.755 --> 00:16:13.635]  This is the way it happens.
[00:16:14.336 --> 00:16:15.076]  Look at these headlines.
[00:16:16.797 --> 00:16:19.718]  Worried IMF cuts world growth forecast.
[00:16:19.838 --> 00:16:21.438]  Warns of Brexit.
[00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:22.779]  Britain leaving the Euro.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.340]  Here's another one.
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.321]  This is MSNBC and CNBC.
[00:16:28.781 --> 00:16:31.542]  Soros, European Union in mortal danger.
[00:16:32.442 --> 00:16:36.683]  Don't worry, a huge multi-trillion dollar bailout to him and others will fix it.
[00:16:37.344 --> 00:16:38.064]  For a few years.
[00:16:42.242 --> 00:16:46.746]  Oliver Blanchard eyes ugly endgame for Japan on debt spiral.
[00:16:46.806 --> 00:16:48.928]  It's all coming down, the bubble they created.
[00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:54.093]  In Wyoming, hard times return as energy prices slump.
[00:16:54.733 --> 00:16:57.496]  I love how Kasich always claims he made Ohio so successful.
[00:16:58.136 --> 00:17:05.203]  It was the fracking industry and it was oil boom that did that for so many states and now that's about to hit.
[00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:09.033]  And it's going to make the subprime mortgage look like a walk in the park.
[00:17:09.553 --> 00:17:10.474]  Many analysts agree.
[00:17:10.754 --> 00:17:15.237]  And Obama's been shutting it up where people with no money or credit can get houses again.
[00:17:15.937 --> 00:17:16.818]  So get ready for that.
[00:17:17.959 --> 00:17:21.521]  And that's not really what's the problem, is giving people that don't have a lot of money a house.
[00:17:22.062 --> 00:17:23.482]  Because generally they end up paying the bill.
[00:17:23.523 --> 00:17:24.483]  They kind of blame it on that.
[00:17:24.823 --> 00:17:29.687]  It's that they're selling those mortgages up to a hundred times apiece.
[00:17:31.417 --> 00:17:34.820]  They always, you know, the issue isn't that going belly up.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:39.485]  That just causes the chain reaction that's 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 times bigger.
[00:17:40.686 --> 00:17:42.928]  And then there's little juicies like this.
[00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:45.751]  Gun owners are terrorists.
[00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:47.993]  Hillary nods in agreement.
[00:17:51.556 --> 00:17:52.577]  Yeah, we've got that video.
[00:17:53.058 --> 00:17:54.579]  Gun owners are terrorists.
[00:17:54.599 --> 00:17:55.260]  That's a quote.
[00:17:58.271 --> 00:18:02.672]  Video, Black Lives Matter, spits in Trump supporters face.
[00:18:02.872 --> 00:18:06.793]  I mean, this is all on InfoWars.com, but I want to stop here for just a minute.
[00:18:08.933 --> 00:18:16.255]  It was George Orwell that said, in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:18:18.695 --> 00:18:25.256]  He also wrote that the ability to say 2 plus 2 equals 4 is all that you need for freedom to operate.
[00:18:26.117 --> 00:18:27.877]  Which is true, common sense and natural law.
[00:18:30.236 --> 00:18:37.563]  And I've always said I'm no hero doing my job and telling the truth because I understand history and how the world works and read the Globalist on white papers.
[00:18:39.605 --> 00:18:43.649]  But in a world of cowards, I guess doing your duty does make you a hero.
[00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:47.914]  But let me tell you who a real hero is, and it's not because he links to our stories.
[00:18:48.975 --> 00:18:53.259]  Drudge is about the second largest referrer at our site, number one's Facebook.
[00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.703]  But in the aggregate, it's just the listeners on our radio stations and our supporters.
[00:19:01.183 --> 00:19:09.729]  But I do relish, you know, putting stories out and then Drudge links to them and they go super viral and become major talking points in Congress and laws get passed based on our research.
[00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:11.890]  It's fulfilling.
[00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:13.811]  It's not about being in competition with other media.
[00:19:14.152 --> 00:19:15.432]  But I want to say something about Matt Drudge.
[00:19:16.993 --> 00:19:18.174]  Matt Drudge is a hero.
[00:19:19.395 --> 00:19:22.917]  Matt Drudge is a true trailblazer and Matt Drudge is not a coward.
[00:19:23.678 --> 00:19:26.500]  And Matt Drudge, early on, was pretty much a Ted Cruz supporter.
[00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:33.776]  But when he saw Ted Cruz do horrible things the last six months, he simply linked to it.
[00:19:34.837 --> 00:19:39.201]  Hey, look, they just cancelled voting in four states and are giving Ted Cruz all the delegates.
[00:19:39.542 --> 00:19:48.571]  Hey, look, in Louisiana and Tennessee and all these other states, they're just giving, and now Arkansas, the votes to Ted Cruz of Trump voters.
[00:19:49.592 --> 00:19:51.034]  All he does is link to it.
[00:19:52.921 --> 00:19:55.851]  And now he's got Glenn Beck bullying him, saying he's bad.
[00:19:55.871 --> 00:19:57.957]  He's got Cruz coming out doing it.
[00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:01.652]  And believe me, folks, the power structure is upset.
[00:20:02.972 --> 00:20:04.213]  And they're flipping out.
[00:20:04.413 --> 00:20:10.257]  And people need to recognize that, you know, they're talking about arresting... Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:20:10.517 --> 00:20:11.798]  You can't survive without it.
[00:20:12.018 --> 00:20:12.939]  But where do you get it?
[00:20:13.199 --> 00:20:18.982]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:20:19.202 --> 00:20:24.926]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:20:25.106 --> 00:20:41.953]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:20:42.353 --> 00:20:44.494]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:20:44.835 --> 00:20:46.035]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:20:46.316 --> 00:20:47.096]  Easy assembly.
[00:20:47.356 --> 00:20:47.977]  Low maintenance.
[00:20:48.277 --> 00:20:50.098]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:17.523]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:21:17.583 --> 00:21:25.694]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:21:25.974 --> 00:21:30.676]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:21:30.856 --> 00:21:37.578]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:21:37.638 --> 00:21:44.721]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:21:44.821 --> 00:21:51.683]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:21:51.843 --> 00:21:56.205]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:21:56.325 --> 00:21:59.586]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:21:59.707 --> 00:22:05.849]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:22:06.009 --> 00:22:08.210]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:09.371]  Brain Force is here.
[00:22:09.891 --> 00:22:12.172]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:22:12.452 --> 00:22:20.256]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:22:21.041 --> 00:22:24.204]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:22:24.484 --> 00:22:24.624]  Right?
[00:22:24.644 --> 00:22:26.986]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:30.849]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:34.031]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:22:34.552 --> 00:22:39.316]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:22:39.896 --> 00:22:41.698]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:22:42.058 --> 00:22:46.481]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:22:46.642 --> 00:22:48.663]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:22:49.284 --> 00:22:50.745]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:22:50.885 --> 00:22:51.145]  Exactly.
[00:22:51.165 --> 00:22:54.949]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:22:55.469 --> 00:23:02.735]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:23:02.995 --> 00:23:03.456]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[00:23:08.226 --> 00:23:11.187]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[00:23:11.467 --> 00:23:21.070]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:26.571]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[00:23:26.651 --> 00:23:35.494]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[00:23:35.774 --> 00:23:44.337]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[00:23:44.597 --> 00:23:51.500]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spigerex herbal processing technique.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:57.702]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best price out there.

[00:24:02.906 --> 00:24:05.628]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:24:05.668 --> 00:24:19.217]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:19.798 --> 00:24:22.780]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:35.936 --> 00:24:37.557]  So here is what is happening.
[00:24:38.617 --> 00:24:41.458]  I've got a whole bunch of clips I want to go over and break down.
[00:24:42.038 --> 00:24:44.059]  Ted Cruz mocks Trump.
[00:24:44.299 --> 00:24:45.399]  We're going to go through these in a moment.
[00:24:46.079 --> 00:24:48.940]  Calls Colorado voterless win democracy.
[00:24:50.961 --> 00:24:52.101]  He's run by the Bushes.
[00:24:53.242 --> 00:24:54.822]  His wife engineered TPP.
[00:24:55.602 --> 00:25:00.284]  He says that he is a George Herbert Walker Bush protege and first worked in his administration.
[00:25:00.464 --> 00:25:03.025]  And Ted Cruz is officially
[00:25:04.304 --> 00:25:07.865]  A Rockefeller Republican globalist sleeper cell operative.
[00:25:10.366 --> 00:25:11.167]  There's no doubt.
[00:25:14.568 --> 00:25:16.489]  He is now run by Marvin and Neil Bush.
[00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:21.211]  The SNL kingpins.
[00:25:22.651 --> 00:25:23.532]  The SNL scam.
[00:25:23.552 --> 00:25:27.473]  I mean, these people are hardcore criminals.
[00:25:28.654 --> 00:25:33.576]  And the Bushes were rejected, and Clinton was rejected, so they're force-feeding Clinton over Sanders.
[00:25:35.643 --> 00:25:46.650]  And they're force-feeding Cruz, and they even say they're going to dump him and go with a Paul Ryan who is meeting with donors as we speak.
[00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:47.350]  That's in the news.
[00:25:48.571 --> 00:25:51.653]  They're going to vote and install Paul Ryan.
[00:25:51.673 --> 00:25:53.034]  That's what they're looking at right now.
[00:25:53.094 --> 00:25:53.974]  He's the top choice.
[00:25:54.535 --> 00:25:55.195]  It may change.
[00:25:55.775 --> 00:25:57.817]  With no popular votes.
[00:25:58.197 --> 00:26:00.839]  And look at you with a straight face like it's normal.
[00:26:01.707 --> 00:26:03.249]  Roger Stone called me this morning.
[00:26:03.489 --> 00:26:06.494]  Let's go to my Twitter because I put a tweet out on it and my Facebook.
[00:26:08.576 --> 00:26:11.020]  And said, please promote that I'm coming on today.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:11.941]  He's never done this before.
[00:26:12.401 --> 00:26:14.124]  This is going to be the biggest news ever.
[00:26:16.086 --> 00:26:17.749]  And you notice his chief of staff.
[00:26:22.915 --> 00:26:25.776]  His business partner is the guy running the Trump campaign.
[00:26:26.196 --> 00:26:26.916]  There's my tweet.
[00:26:27.736 --> 00:26:34.478]  Roger Stone, the man the GOP wants arrested, will break the biggest election news on the broadcast today.
[00:26:36.418 --> 00:26:41.780]  And he is coming up in the full second hour.
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:44.180]  Of course, he was going to be on last week, but had to reschedule.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:44.780]  This is even better.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.401]  He's coming on now.
[00:26:45.761 --> 00:26:47.021]  He'll be covering the same subject.
[00:26:48.243 --> 00:26:55.767]  He's been friends with Donald Trump for 40 years and was actually in business with him early on and says the guy is absolutely for real and is a patriot sleeper cell.
[00:26:56.748 --> 00:26:58.749]  Cruz is a globalist sleeper cell.
[00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:06.713]  Trump is a patriot sleeper cell and reportedly knows more than I do about the New World Order and has been playing dumb the entire time.
[00:27:06.753 --> 00:27:08.774]  That's why they've got surveillance on Trump.
[00:27:08.814 --> 00:27:09.574]  They know who he is.
[00:27:09.594 --> 00:27:16.398]  They've got files on him and they are... Even though it's a family show, I have to use the word, they are crapping their pants, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:17.924 --> 00:27:19.684]  They believe he's a Patriot sleeper cell.
[00:27:21.205 --> 00:27:27.806]  And they are absolutely having heart attacks over it, and you're seeing the evidence of that right now.
[00:27:27.826 --> 00:27:32.447]  I want to start going to some of these clips after the break, but I won't have plenty of time to go over them.
[00:27:33.908 --> 00:27:35.228]  Here are some of the news pieces.
[00:27:36.969 --> 00:27:39.709]  Cruz, Drudge is an attack site for Trump's campaign.
[00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:47.131]  No, Drudge cannot support you, Cruz, and I can't either.
[00:27:48.746 --> 00:27:57.330]  And I supported you over Trump just six, seven months ago because you're working with the party insiders to cancel elections, okay?
[00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:00.231]  We can't be part of that, Ted Cruz.
[00:28:05.854 --> 00:28:07.475]  Quite frankly, there's some of the ads on the network.
[00:28:08.175 --> 00:28:12.997]  I'm such a purist that I'm not endorsing what I'm hard of, that I'm looking at radical changes.
[00:28:13.037 --> 00:28:14.378]  I'll just be honest with this radio show.
[00:28:14.598 --> 00:28:16.519]  So I don't have to have ads on my show I don't agree with.
[00:28:17.386 --> 00:28:18.887]  So just message it to some of the people out there.
[00:28:19.967 --> 00:28:22.368]  I can't be part of baloney.
[00:28:23.089 --> 00:28:24.289]  I can't be associated with it.
[00:28:24.709 --> 00:28:26.470]  And it's not because people even notice.
[00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:29.131]  It's because I won't be involved.
[00:28:29.191 --> 00:28:29.952]  I'm superstitious.
[00:28:30.352 --> 00:28:31.172]  I'm God-fearing.
[00:28:32.093 --> 00:28:33.653]  I don't screw people over.
[00:28:35.094 --> 00:28:38.575]  I don't come after people that didn't have it coming to them, to quote Tony Montana.
[00:28:43.558 --> 00:28:46.199]  Even when my enemies are attacking me, if I'm not cornered,
[00:28:47.771 --> 00:28:48.652]  I don't even respond.
[00:28:50.833 --> 00:28:52.815]  You go after my kids, obviously I'm coming after you.
[00:28:56.777 --> 00:28:59.339]  I'll tell you what's weird about all these punks and people that mess with me through my life.
[00:28:59.819 --> 00:29:00.780]  I've never lost.
[00:29:02.301 --> 00:29:04.803]  I've got providence and I'm not, by the way, bragging about that.
[00:29:04.863 --> 00:29:07.225]  It is humbling to my knees.
[00:29:09.986 --> 00:29:13.169]  And I look at these dishonorable people who laugh at those that have some honor.
[00:29:14.206 --> 00:29:21.650]  You know, Phyllis Schlafly is the original person with Barry Goldwater that launched what is the Tea Party today and all that's left of this country.
[00:29:23.551 --> 00:29:26.813]  She was right 50 years ago about the New World Order, everything.
[00:29:29.034 --> 00:29:37.339]  Cruz supporters in the Eagle Forum tried to hijack and take her bank accounts and shut it down and take it away from her to support Cruz.
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:39.400]  Why not?
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.201]  You're going to steal Colorado and all these other states.
[00:29:41.541 --> 00:29:43.042]  Why not just take over the Eagle Forum?
[00:29:44.028 --> 00:29:52.733]  See, when they start installing presidents, when they start stealing elections, your bank account, your house, your kids are next.
[00:29:53.213 --> 00:29:54.274]  Do people get that?
[00:29:54.714 --> 00:29:58.116]  They want authoritarianism to make us slaves.
[00:29:59.396 --> 00:30:02.418]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.318 --> 00:30:06.020]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.228 --> 00:30:11.610]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:13.192]  You can't survive without it.
[00:30:13.373 --> 00:30:14.274]  But where do you get it?
[00:30:14.574 --> 00:30:20.342]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:30:20.563 --> 00:30:26.291]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:30:26.471 --> 00:30:43.321]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:30:43.721 --> 00:30:45.863]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:30:46.203 --> 00:30:47.404]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:30:47.684 --> 00:30:48.384]  Easy assembly.
[00:30:48.725 --> 00:30:49.345]  Low maintenance.
[00:30:49.645 --> 00:30:51.446]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:31:09.179 --> 00:31:13.101]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:31:13.281 --> 00:31:15.543]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:31:15.723 --> 00:31:24.089]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:31:24.349 --> 00:31:27.691]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:31:27.852 --> 00:31:38.319]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:31:38.499 --> 00:31:45.784]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:31:45.985 --> 00:31:47.846]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:31:48.206 --> 00:31:55.855]  Supermail Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:31:56.155 --> 00:32:02.342]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:32:02.642 --> 00:32:09.570]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Supermail Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:11.411]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:32:11.852 --> 00:32:17.776]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:32:17.996 --> 00:32:32.168]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running 6 miles every other day, swimming 2-3 miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights
[00:32:32.748 --> 00:32:34.669]  We're focusing on fighting the globalists.
[00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:42.915]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:32:43.095 --> 00:32:50.260]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:56.264]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:32:56.384 --> 00:33:02.588]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.

[00:33:10.975 --> 00:33:15.959]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:19.421 --> 00:33:23.565]  And you can see that we're on the front lines of the Information War.
[00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:37.116]  White House, Run, Media Matters and other combines, programming, CNN, MSNBC and other platforms openly attack us every single day.
[00:33:41.179 --> 00:33:44.961]  I was watching Fox News as I do every morning on the elliptical warming up to work out.
[00:33:47.242 --> 00:33:51.285]  And I watched a good 30 minutes of it.
[00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:58.590]  And they would say, it's ridiculous, have you heard?
[00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:01.551]  Donald Trump's claiming he got cheated.
[00:34:01.671 --> 00:34:05.172]  And they play like five seconds of him going, it's rigged, it's bad.
[00:34:05.893 --> 00:34:11.355]  And then they cut back Hemmer, the guy that looks like he could play American Psycho.
[00:34:12.635 --> 00:34:14.436]  He cuts back reading off the teleprompter.
[00:34:17.097 --> 00:34:20.198]  And they say, funny then, why are you in the lead?
[00:34:23.979 --> 00:34:25.339]  Thinking their audience are idiots.
[00:34:25.399 --> 00:34:26.840]  They're stealing the news states.
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:32.261]  They're canceling elections, giving all the delegates to Cruz so he comes up and meets Trump or beats Trump.
[00:34:33.902 --> 00:34:37.123]  And then they play this game going, what, did you get cheated in the other states?
[00:34:37.403 --> 00:34:39.783]  No, they just started massively cheating a few months ago.
[00:34:43.104 --> 00:34:45.445]  And then they're laughing, him and the girl giggling.
[00:34:50.339 --> 00:34:54.020]  And they go, this system is actually benefiting him, and then show no proof.
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:35:02.622]  It's like MSNBC going, Alex Jones doesn't like Obamacare, because the Boston Bombers are his fans, and he's deeply racist.
[00:35:02.702 --> 00:35:03.502]  That's a quote!
[00:35:04.582 --> 00:35:11.004]  No proof Boston bombing, no racist clip, just Donald Trump wants to kill Mexicans.
[00:35:13.185 --> 00:35:19.046]  And now it's not just the Onion that puts out fake headlines, it's the Boston Globe and other publications.
[00:35:22.298 --> 00:35:25.640]  Putting up fake headlines of what Trump supports and what Trump has done.
[00:35:29.201 --> 00:35:33.803]  So, it's all reached a new level, and let me boil down what's happening here.
[00:35:33.843 --> 00:35:35.064]  I really looked at this carefully.
[00:35:36.404 --> 00:35:47.930]  Across the world, Davos, that is the public arm of the Bilderberg Group, the Davos meeting for the last four or five years, has come out and just said, look,
[00:35:48.715 --> 00:35:49.876]  There's a new form of government.
[00:35:50.096 --> 00:35:51.216]  It's called technocracy.
[00:35:51.596 --> 00:35:54.178]  We're going to start appointing prime ministers and presidents.
[00:35:54.738 --> 00:35:57.059]  We're going to bring countries into bankruptcy receivership.
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:03.482]  And then we're going to have their parliaments or legislatures start appointing Goldman Sachs heads.
[00:36:03.522 --> 00:36:04.683]  It's always a Goldman Sachs head.
[00:36:04.703 --> 00:36:05.243]  I mean, look it up.
[00:36:06.744 --> 00:36:10.666]  Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Italy.
[00:36:10.806 --> 00:36:12.487]  I mean, it's crazy the last five years.
[00:36:16.158 --> 00:36:19.280]  And then the media just goes, wonderful, we now have appointed presidents.
[00:36:19.961 --> 00:36:27.185]  And oh, we're under these Pacific Treaty, and Asian Pacific Treaty, and EU Treaty, and Atlantic NAU Treaty.
[00:36:27.545 --> 00:36:28.506]  This is all official.
[00:36:28.766 --> 00:36:30.808]  And they go, oh, but sorry, the full text is secret.
[00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:40.414]  And then we get the text from the 2007 meeting to my film, Endgame.
[00:36:42.233 --> 00:36:46.396]  And they had over a hundred corporate heads in a roundtable event in Banff, Canada.
[00:36:46.856 --> 00:37:04.627]  They voted on the next six-year plan and then they had the prime ministers and presidents all there outside of them, lower level, who then pledged with their state department heads and other heads of state to implement.
[00:37:06.127 --> 00:37:08.169]  They go vote in secret councils
[00:37:09.577 --> 00:37:14.459]  And then they come down and then both parties, or in the case of England, all three parties implement it.
[00:37:19.201 --> 00:37:24.583]  Just like the Central Committee in China, or in Cuba, or in Venezuela.
[00:37:25.203 --> 00:37:32.806]  And then they have a Politburo that they appoint from themselves that goes and elects the president.
[00:37:35.367 --> 00:37:36.888]  And that's what the two parties are doing.
[00:37:38.302 --> 00:37:39.443]  I think so.
[00:37:39.463 --> 00:37:42.806]  If we're going to be ruled by foreign secret committees, why not have it be the parties?
[00:37:43.806 --> 00:37:45.288]  And the arrogance is so great.
[00:37:45.368 --> 00:37:57.678]  They have Previs and Curly Hewlin and the rest of them go on TV and they just calmly go, of course we now appoint.
[00:37:58.298 --> 00:37:59.559]  It was never about your vote.
[00:37:59.619 --> 00:38:04.603]  And the reporters go, even the established reporters go, why are you having an election?
[00:38:04.643 --> 00:38:05.724]  And they go, good, good point.
[00:38:05.744 --> 00:38:07.946]  We may just get rid of those.
[00:38:09.295 --> 00:38:22.906]  And these are unelected, just party officials, party hacks appointed by somebody else, stealing the public interest, false advertising, racketeering fraud in your face.
[00:38:26.468 --> 00:38:29.751]  CNBC, we choose the nominee, not the voter, senior GOP official.
[00:38:31.201 --> 00:38:40.884]  That was back in the 16th of March, basically a little less than a month ago, 38 days ago, 27 days ago.
[00:38:44.065 --> 00:38:45.666]  It makes the head spin.
[00:38:50.967 --> 00:38:55.709]  And so what's happening is, the head of the Republican Party in Colorado, I have the article right here,
[00:38:56.977 --> 00:39:01.999]  He said in tweets and he said the statements to Republicans there that are about to protest this Friday.
[00:39:02.019 --> 00:39:04.861]  We're going to have Joe Biggs and others there covering it in Denver.
[00:39:06.502 --> 00:39:08.863]  Colorado GOP leader dissing Ronald Trump supporter.
[00:39:08.943 --> 00:39:10.964]  Go ahead and burn the party down.
[00:39:11.324 --> 00:39:17.087]  These are the same people that put out the tweet five minutes on the official party website.
[00:39:17.527 --> 00:39:18.167]  Never Trump.
[00:39:18.287 --> 00:39:18.727]  We did it.
[00:39:21.649 --> 00:39:22.729]  And they said, oh, that was wrong.
[00:39:22.789 --> 00:39:23.710]  Sorry, we shouldn't brag.
[00:39:25.083 --> 00:39:27.745]  See, the bragging's what's wrong, not the stealing.
[00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:33.050]  They're not supposed to act like they just did something and got something over on the voters.
[00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:42.237]  They're establishing their own little party dictatorship, saying millions and millions of registered voters in Colorado can't vote, and now other states are announcing it.
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:50.624]  And now they're announcing, oh sorry, those Arkansas Trump votes, they're going to Cruz.
[00:39:50.804 --> 00:39:51.525]  That's being announced.
[00:39:53.146 --> 00:39:54.007]  It's a confidence game.
[00:39:56.391 --> 00:39:58.912]  Walsing in and taking everything.
[00:39:59.753 --> 00:40:02.774]  And I've noticed a lot of people that aren't that smart, they just do a confidence game.
[00:40:03.294 --> 00:40:04.034]  They act cool.
[00:40:04.074 --> 00:40:04.855]  They act like they're in charge.
[00:40:04.875 --> 00:40:09.337]  And that works on other dumbed-down people, but you can't fool everybody all the time.
[00:40:09.377 --> 00:40:21.182]  And there's a large minority of people that are really sharp, and they know you're running a confidence game, and they're really getting ready to get off the bench and come into the game.
[00:40:25.148 --> 00:40:28.809]  Colorado GOP deletes Never Trump tweet after Cruz's victory.
[00:40:29.329 --> 00:40:34.550]  Colorado GOP on deleted hashtag Never Trump tweet from their account.
[00:40:35.871 --> 00:40:39.712]  And they said in the tweet, we did it.
[00:40:40.932 --> 00:40:42.132]  Show TV viewers a shot of it.
[00:40:44.093 --> 00:40:44.573]  We did it.
[00:40:44.653 --> 00:40:45.653]  Hashtag Never Trump.
[00:40:46.413 --> 00:40:47.233]  We did it.
[00:40:48.334 --> 00:40:48.994]  We did it.
[00:40:49.334 --> 00:40:53.795]  Just like the silly Simpsons piece where they're in the secret Bilderberg meeting going, you know,
[00:40:54.875 --> 00:40:56.136]  Who rigs the elections?
[00:40:56.356 --> 00:40:57.397]  We did.
[00:40:57.717 --> 00:40:58.457]  We did.
[00:40:58.477 --> 00:41:00.639]  I mean, they're now channeling the Simpsons.
[00:41:01.039 --> 00:41:01.980]  We did.
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:02.900]  We did.
[00:41:03.101 --> 00:41:03.721]  We did it.
[00:41:03.941 --> 00:41:04.582]  We vote.
[00:41:04.802 --> 00:41:06.043]  We decide who goes for president.
[00:41:06.123 --> 00:41:06.883]  We do.
[00:41:07.283 --> 00:41:07.804]  We do.
[00:41:08.164 --> 00:41:16.350]  And then, you have to chastise Drudge and chastise Alex Jones and chastise Roger Stone.
[00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:18.751]  And just, oh, he should be arrested.
[00:41:18.771 --> 00:41:21.033]  When we played those clips yesterday, he's coming on in about 20 minutes.
[00:41:27.085 --> 00:41:40.491]  And now, Phyllis Schlafly, the 91-year-old constitutional lawyer, still super sharp, routine guest on this show, been coming on my show for 20 years.
[00:41:41.592 --> 00:41:43.673]  She was on when I'd only been on radio about six months.
[00:41:44.713 --> 00:41:46.294]  She's been coming on more than 20 years.
[00:41:48.475 --> 00:41:50.836]  And she says Trump isn't perfect, but he's a nationalist.
[00:41:51.156 --> 00:41:52.457]  He doesn't want unfair trade deals.
[00:41:52.697 --> 00:41:54.158]  He wants us to have basic sovereignty.
[00:41:55.322 --> 00:41:57.103]  He is why the Globals are so upset.
[00:41:57.163 --> 00:41:58.344]  She rightfully is for him.
[00:41:58.364 --> 00:42:00.565]  She says they're gonna try to destroy him like Barry Goldwater.
[00:42:02.287 --> 00:42:03.427]  Say he'll cause nuclear war.
[00:42:03.627 --> 00:42:05.969]  Same story's going again to get LBJ in.
[00:42:06.629 --> 00:42:13.974]  And folks, they had the inner board that she heads up try to hijack it and grab the bank accounts and the bank said no and stopped it.
[00:42:14.655 --> 00:42:16.136]  There needs to be a criminal investigation.
[00:42:18.017 --> 00:42:22.980]  And it was a bunch of Cruz supporters on the board that even convinced her daughter to do it.
[00:42:26.957 --> 00:42:29.739]  Phyllis Schlafly, my board plotted to fire me over Trump.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.041]  Of course, he talked her to the interview he's coming on in the third hour.
[00:42:34.061 --> 00:42:36.363]  We're going to get her on as well, maybe even today.
[00:42:40.125 --> 00:42:42.106]  Hey, why not steal her organization?
[00:42:42.126 --> 00:42:43.567]  I mean, you're going to steal other states.
[00:42:43.587 --> 00:42:47.149]  You're going to tell folks Ben Carson quit.
[00:42:53.638 --> 00:43:00.800]  And how else is Ted Cruz going to rule the world like he said he wanted to do when he was a college student and a teenager?
[00:43:03.501 --> 00:43:06.802]  Cruz drudges an attack site for Trump campaign.
[00:43:06.822 --> 00:43:10.083]  We're going to play this clip in a moment.
[00:43:10.143 --> 00:43:13.204]  And then, of course, I never played it, but two weeks ago.
[00:43:17.011 --> 00:43:24.813]  The cult leader, Glenn Beck, I mean he is now an official religious cult leader and he's the false prophet and his messiah is Ted Cruz.
[00:43:25.273 --> 00:43:45.917]  You know, he comes out and says that Drudge is anti-Christian now and I'm crazy and that I've diseased Drudge's mind as if I have any influence and that he's not a good source of information anymore because Glenn Beck
[00:43:47.188 --> 00:43:47.608]  Said so.
[00:43:52.589 --> 00:43:54.490]  Aspartame admittedly makes you go blind.
[00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:56.711]  It's in Diet Coke and thousands of other products.
[00:43:56.731 --> 00:43:57.311]  It's been proven.
[00:43:57.331 --> 00:43:57.731]  It's admitted.
[00:43:58.411 --> 00:43:59.371]  It turns into wood alcohol.
[00:44:01.352 --> 00:44:02.912]  And Beck said he was going blind.
[00:44:03.252 --> 00:44:16.036]  So I wrote a story and all the medical links to it with Paul Watson a few years ago and sent it to Beck and sent it to Drudge and Drudge linked to it under the story about Beck going blind trying to help him and
[00:44:17.216 --> 00:44:20.037]  Glenn Beck made fun of it on air and said we were idiots the next day.
[00:44:21.737 --> 00:44:27.858]  That's the type of cynical, twisted weirdo, I guess Kurt Neumann wrote it, that we're dealing with here.
[00:44:28.999 --> 00:44:32.639]  I know the inside baseball on Beck, I'm not going to get into it, but he'll end up destroying himself.
[00:44:32.679 --> 00:44:38.261]  I mean, he is a egomaniac, super narcissist, probably psychotic in my view.
[00:44:40.781 --> 00:44:45.022]  And he's insane and wants to be a cult leader.
[00:44:47.438 --> 00:44:49.320]  And Drudge has shown that.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.081]  And so now he's anti-Christian.
[00:44:51.101 --> 00:44:54.944]  See, if you don't support the prophet Moses' return, you didn't know?
[00:44:54.964 --> 00:44:59.208]  In fact, the two prophets of Revelation, it's Ted Cruz and Glenn Beck, you didn't know?
[00:44:59.808 --> 00:45:02.010]  He says he's a priesthood he's starting.
[00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:03.351]  Oh, yeah.
[00:45:04.452 --> 00:45:04.792]  Oh, really?
[00:45:04.812 --> 00:45:11.978]  The liberal, hardcore shock jock that was hired right before 9-11 and gotten ready to come out?
[00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:15.431]  To be the synthetic Alex Jones?
[00:45:15.471 --> 00:45:17.192]  I mean, I've been told that by the executives involved.
[00:45:17.673 --> 00:45:23.376]  Where they sat, and he's an actor, and watched weeks of my videos and shows and said, take this and mix it with Oprah.
[00:45:23.556 --> 00:45:26.078]  That's what I was told by the executives that used to run his operation.
[00:45:26.398 --> 00:45:28.559]  He's a mixture of Oprah Winfrey and Alex Jones.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.661]  All in a big, weird, doughboy's body.
[00:45:33.662 --> 00:45:34.243]  A cult leader.
[00:45:39.026 --> 00:45:42.468]  A Nelly High Priest.
[00:45:45.674 --> 00:45:46.655]  I'm scared to death, by the way.
[00:45:47.276 --> 00:45:48.357]  Dozens of security people.
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:55.363]  And he thinks he can dictate what happens and who operates.
[00:45:55.423 --> 00:45:59.967]  And now Ted Cruz comes out and demonizes the Drudge Report.
[00:46:01.809 --> 00:46:07.735]  And the Washington Post gets it right, says Ted Cruz's war with Matt Drudge could become a huge problem for his campaign.
[00:46:10.589 --> 00:46:17.516]  You're the one with the Bushes running your campaign, stealing delegates, stealing states, and getting elections canceled, Ted Cruz.
[00:46:18.036 --> 00:46:19.598]  You're the one, and you make a joke.
[00:46:19.618 --> 00:46:20.559]  In fact, let's play this first.
[00:46:21.099 --> 00:46:26.424]  Ted Cruz mocks Trump, calls Colorado voterless win democracy on Fox News.
[00:46:26.464 --> 00:46:26.784]  Here it is.
[00:46:27.645 --> 00:46:32.930]  The latest thing he seized upon is when people vote against him.
[00:46:34.131 --> 00:46:35.733]  They're stealing the election.
[00:46:38.951 --> 00:46:39.852]  That's an odd notion.
[00:46:40.574 --> 00:46:42.857]  What is this democracy of which you speak?
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:47.044]  And then he goes on, there's a transcript of it on Infowars.com.
[00:46:48.847 --> 00:46:52.013]  He's speaking of Colorado, where no one was allowed to vote.
[00:46:53.732 --> 00:46:56.414]  Oh, but the superdelegates decide.
[00:46:56.894 --> 00:46:59.415]  Oh, they decided to cancel it and give it 30-40.
[00:47:00.776 --> 00:47:08.000]  Oh, it's a vote of the inter... Like, China has votes by the Central Committee and the Politburo.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.081]  They do have voting in Cuba, too.
[00:47:11.242 --> 00:47:11.762]  You know what?
[00:47:11.882 --> 00:47:13.063]  You just taught me, Ted.
[00:47:13.083 --> 00:47:16.825]  I mean, this guy has uncloaked and is worse than Hillary Clinton.
[00:47:19.738 --> 00:47:23.242]  Who said that Iran is behind ISIS when they're archenemies.
[00:47:24.003 --> 00:47:25.766]  Okay, so let's go to the next clip.
[00:47:26.867 --> 00:47:32.694]  Ted Cruz says the Drudge Report is an attack site for Donald Trump campaign on the Mike Slater Show.
[00:47:34.516 --> 00:47:38.742]  And again, they've got all the Clear Channel people basically in the pike.
[00:47:41.257 --> 00:47:47.262]  And I've been told by big clear channel shows, hey, we'd like to have you on Alex, but you know until the election over, you're not supposed to be on now because you're a Trump supporter.
[00:47:47.902 --> 00:47:51.265]  Roger Stone, The Washington Post asked, why has he been banned from every TV network?
[00:47:52.406 --> 00:47:55.908]  Why would you not want one of the top analysts for the campaign on?
[00:47:56.769 --> 00:47:57.810]  He's on in like 15 minutes.
[00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:00.552]  Because he's too effective, folks.
[00:48:00.612 --> 00:48:01.793]  I mean, this is happening.
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:03.380]  I'm restricted.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.081]  I'm taking off XM.
[00:48:05.881 --> 00:48:11.103]  They have people come into our affiliates and they'll tell them, hospital districts, federal government funded stuff.
[00:48:11.343 --> 00:48:11.943]  We'll give you $300,000.
[00:48:11.983 --> 00:48:13.543]  Just take Alex Jones off.
[00:48:14.424 --> 00:48:14.844]  It's happening.
[00:48:16.604 --> 00:48:18.325]  Folks, they are taking the country over.
[00:48:20.125 --> 00:48:23.106]  And people are still so foolish in the conservative movement.
[00:48:23.466 --> 00:48:26.427]  You think Ted Cruz, because he says the right things, is good?
[00:48:26.447 --> 00:48:28.748]  So there it is.
[00:48:28.788 --> 00:48:31.509]  Drudge Report is an attack site for Donald Trump.
[00:48:33.599 --> 00:48:36.361]  No, the Drudge Report isn't for suspending elections.
[00:48:38.182 --> 00:48:39.643]  What you call is a vote.
[00:48:41.325 --> 00:48:45.207]  And then your crowd giggles and laughs.
[00:48:45.708 --> 00:48:46.308]  Let's play the clip.
[00:48:47.309 --> 00:48:48.450]  Drudge Report lately.
[00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:50.751]  Not even, right?
[00:48:50.831 --> 00:48:54.474]  Not even about Trump, but they're anti-Christian headlines.
[00:48:54.514 --> 00:48:57.376]  One of my favorites was a couple weeks ago, and it was in red, right?
[00:48:57.776 --> 00:49:02.480]  Pastor calls for execution of gays, then introduces Ted Cruz.
[00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:05.030]  And I said, hold on, right?
[00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:10.031]  And I clicked it, and of course he just listed a bunch of sins and talked about spiritual death, not execution.
[00:49:10.051 --> 00:49:14.792]  And then there are all these headlines about people laying hands on you to make you seem like a crazy weirdo.
[00:49:14.812 --> 00:49:19.153]  I feel like we have enough people attacking Christianity, we don't need Drudge's help.
[00:49:19.533 --> 00:49:20.173]  What do you think of that?
[00:49:20.293 --> 00:49:28.175]  Well, look, Drudge Report over the years has done a good job highlighting the excesses of the left and the excesses of liberalism.
[00:49:28.195 --> 00:49:29.615]  And in about the past month,
[00:49:30.479 --> 00:49:36.661]  The Drudge Report has basically become the attack site for the Donald Trump campaign, and so every day they have the latest Trump attack.
[00:49:36.761 --> 00:49:37.861]  They're directed at me.
[00:49:39.442 --> 00:49:51.306]  By all appearances, Roger Stone now decides what's on Drudge, and most days they have a six-month-old article that is some attack on me, and it's whatever the Trump campaign is pushing that day will be the banner headline on Drudge.
[00:49:51.606 --> 00:49:53.186]  By the way, they no longer cover news.
[00:49:53.226 --> 00:49:55.147]  Remember they used to have things like election results?
[00:49:56.196 --> 00:49:58.519]  They don't put those on drudge anymore.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:01.944]  When we win a state, suddenly the state doesn't matter.
[00:50:01.964 --> 00:50:04.347]  You know, Colorado... Hit pause.
[00:50:05.308 --> 00:50:08.753]  Folks, this is lying that is at a new level beyond Obama or Hillary.
[00:50:08.853 --> 00:50:10.715]  I didn't know lies of this magnitude existed.
[00:50:11.616 --> 00:50:14.160]  He says that it was democracy in Colorado.
[00:50:15.697 --> 00:50:19.578]  He says Drudge is posting old, multi-weeks old news.
[00:50:20.259 --> 00:50:26.140]  He was posting Saturday and Sunday and Monday as it happened when they cancelled the election in Colorado.
[00:50:29.802 --> 00:50:34.223]  And then he says when we win a state, they don't report it, like Colorado.
[00:50:34.603 --> 00:50:36.364]  You didn't win the state!
[00:50:42.165 --> 00:50:43.026]  And I want to be clear.
[00:50:43.766 --> 00:50:46.249]  I like Ted Cruz, even though people said don't trust him.
[00:50:46.469 --> 00:50:49.051]  He's a Bush background, CFR, Goldman Sachs.
[00:50:49.672 --> 00:50:52.314]  Man, I don't support Hillary robbing Bernie Sanders.
[00:50:54.456 --> 00:50:55.937]  Bernie has been ahead the whole time.
[00:50:55.977 --> 00:50:57.158]  He'll have 50,000, she has 1,000.
[00:50:57.199 --> 00:51:01.082]  All over the country, he'd win New Hampshire, you name it, they'd give the votes.
[00:51:01.122 --> 00:51:02.323]  He won Wyoming, on and on and on.
[00:51:03.624 --> 00:51:06.407]  I can't stand Bernie Sanders, but man, that's wrong.
[00:51:11.246 --> 00:51:12.688]  And Trump, I've got issues.
[00:51:12.748 --> 00:51:15.131]  He's shooting his mouth off about waterboarding again.
[00:51:16.313 --> 00:51:16.993]  He hates ISIS.
[00:51:17.013 --> 00:51:17.674]  He doesn't get why.
[00:51:17.734 --> 00:51:19.136]  If they break the rules, why can't we?
[00:51:19.176 --> 00:51:20.157]  Because we're the good guys.
[00:51:20.978 --> 00:51:22.861]  Believe me, I'd like to torture some ISIS people.
[00:51:24.062 --> 00:51:26.706]  But by the way, I'm not going to support it and I'm not going to push it.
[00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:36.194]  It's Hillary and it's the Republican Party leadership launching the attacks in Syria and Libya with the hundreds of thousands of dead Christians.
[00:51:36.434 --> 00:51:47.540]  It's Drudge showing the war on Christians worldwide and making it a top issue, linking to CNS News, InfoWars, all the time on the war on Christianity and the war on crosses and the war on Christmas.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:51.342]  I don't think there's any site out there that's defended Christianity more than Matt Drudge.
[00:51:52.338 --> 00:51:53.419]  And I'm going to say it right now.
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:59.244]  It's a backhanded anti-Semitic remark because Matt Drudge is Jewish.
[00:52:00.746 --> 00:52:04.269]  And I don't think of Matt Drudge as white or black or Jewish or anything.
[00:52:04.289 --> 00:52:10.595]  He's a patriot and really a constitutional populist, a libertarian.
[00:52:10.755 --> 00:52:11.536]  And I know Matt Drudge.
[00:52:11.576 --> 00:52:18.122]  He's been here, and I've had dinner with him, and I've talked to him some, and I have people that know him, and I get a really good feeling around him.
[00:52:19.381 --> 00:52:21.543]  And he does good work, and he just gets better and better.
[00:52:21.883 --> 00:52:24.785]  And they can't stand the fact that world government's here.
[00:52:25.325 --> 00:52:26.186]  I've been proven right.
[00:52:26.246 --> 00:52:28.407]  So yeah, Matt Grudge listens to this show every day.
[00:52:29.608 --> 00:52:30.289]  He listens to other ones.
[00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:31.630]  He's got four or five on at all times.
[00:52:33.051 --> 00:52:34.011]  I know his crew as well.
[00:52:35.512 --> 00:52:36.093]  They're good people.
[00:52:36.833 --> 00:52:38.034]  They're freaked out about the future.
[00:52:40.036 --> 00:52:41.437]  They want to save America.
[00:52:41.897 --> 00:52:43.338]  They don't want to have to evacuate.
[00:52:47.483 --> 00:52:48.523]  There's a takeover, folks.
[00:52:48.843 --> 00:52:50.144]  The president ignores the borders.
[00:52:50.164 --> 00:52:50.784]  They're wide open.
[00:52:52.105 --> 00:52:58.347]  And then Ted Cruz gets up there, and it's hard to have every word you say be a lie or a twisted.
[00:52:59.787 --> 00:53:04.309]  It's easy to tell the truth and be passionate and be oratory and skillful because it's out of the heart.
[00:53:04.409 --> 00:53:05.009]  It's easy.
[00:53:05.509 --> 00:53:08.810]  It's hard to sit there and memorize twisted lies in a lifetime.
[00:53:10.571 --> 00:53:11.391]  Cruz is dangerous.
[00:53:12.571 --> 00:53:13.171]  He's probably got 170 IQ.
[00:53:15.325 --> 00:53:17.086]  A lot of psychos have the highest IQs.
[00:53:17.607 --> 00:53:19.107]  I think Ted Cruz is a psychopath.
[00:53:19.448 --> 00:53:20.949]  I really do because he's very convincing.
[00:53:21.209 --> 00:53:24.671]  But the facts is he's a liar and a thief.
[00:53:25.872 --> 00:53:29.434]  And he's got his operatives trying to steal Eagle Forum and shut it down.
[00:53:33.897 --> 00:53:36.519]  Trying to mug the oldest living conservative.
[00:53:37.479 --> 00:53:40.962]  And mug the voters of Colorado and South Dakota and other areas.
[00:53:41.982 --> 00:53:43.383]  And mug the voters of Texas.
[00:53:43.443 --> 00:53:44.484]  Oh, he lost here.
[00:53:48.464 --> 00:53:52.089]  I talked to folks that were down there, delegates, they said it was like 5 to 1 Trump in Travis County.
[00:53:52.469 --> 00:53:53.971]  Other areas, 2, 3 to 1.
[00:53:55.013 --> 00:53:57.536]  Cruz has 1,000, Trump has 50,000, same story.
[00:53:59.639 --> 00:54:04.365]  The establishment's attacking Trump because he's for real and they got a dossier on him.
[00:54:05.424 --> 00:54:10.489]  And I've talked to a bunch of insiders that I kind of just didn't register it before Trump even ran.
[00:54:10.949 --> 00:54:12.771]  I've been talking to people and they go, you know Donald Trump?
[00:54:12.791 --> 00:54:14.232]  You ought to have him on sometime.
[00:54:14.252 --> 00:54:15.453]  I'm like, what do you mean?
[00:54:15.473 --> 00:54:16.534]  Like, you know, he, uh, he likes you.
[00:54:16.554 --> 00:54:18.395]  I'm like, what are you talking about?
[00:54:18.416 --> 00:54:19.516]  I'm talking to some movie star.
[00:54:19.577 --> 00:54:21.198]  I'm talking to a TV host or something.
[00:54:21.218 --> 00:54:22.139]  They're like, yeah, no, you're.
[00:54:24.521 --> 00:54:25.382]  I hang out with Donald Trump.
[00:54:25.402 --> 00:54:26.182]  You ought to, you ought to have him on.
[00:54:26.202 --> 00:54:26.843]  I'm like, what?
[00:54:27.003 --> 00:54:27.443]  Donald Trump?
[00:54:27.744 --> 00:54:29.305]  All of a sudden, Roger Stone comes to me.
[00:54:31.307 --> 00:54:32.248]  Donald Trump comes to me.
[00:54:34.121 --> 00:54:36.482]  And then of course he's on the show a month ago and he goes, you didn't know?
[00:54:36.502 --> 00:54:38.404]  Trump knows more than we do.
[00:54:38.424 --> 00:54:43.787]  And of course he's a famous deep cover operative for you name it.
[00:54:45.948 --> 00:54:48.450]  And they're old line people that really are for this country.
[00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:50.451]  These are nationalists you see defending this country.
[00:54:51.652 --> 00:54:53.733]  And Trump has been approached by people.
[00:54:54.553 --> 00:54:58.656]  They gave him briefings on everything that's going on and he basically is on a suicide mission.
[00:54:59.909 --> 00:55:00.450]  And you know what?
[00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:05.374]  Even though Trump's got problems, he's an old-fashioned guy, you know, right-wing populist at his heart.
[00:55:06.596 --> 00:55:09.198]  Played patty-cake with the left to do business on the East Coast.
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:15.084]  I'm proud to be on this mission with Trump, and I'm proud to be on it with Matt Drudge.
[00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:17.066]  That's the kind of company I want to keep.
[00:55:17.186 --> 00:55:19.809]  Not with these other people.
[00:55:19.869 --> 00:55:21.991]  My God, the Bush family backing Cruz.
[00:55:22.532 --> 00:55:23.332]  Let's go back to Cruz.
[00:55:23.352 --> 00:55:23.613]  Here it is.
[00:55:24.986 --> 00:55:27.908]  When we win a state, suddenly the state doesn't matter.
[00:55:27.928 --> 00:55:36.553]  You know, Colorado, there was no red siren on Drudge when we won all 34 delegates in Colorado.
[00:55:36.593 --> 00:55:36.693]  What?
[00:55:36.714 --> 00:55:38.635]  That wasn't news because... What?
[00:55:38.675 --> 00:55:39.175]  That's fine.
[00:55:39.215 --> 00:55:40.996]  If people want to... Hit pause.
[00:55:41.076 --> 00:55:41.517]  Hit pause.
[00:55:41.897 --> 00:55:44.378]  Put up what he put up Saturday and Sunday.
[00:55:45.919 --> 00:55:46.420]  And Monday.
[00:55:47.588 --> 00:55:49.149]  Drudge has never run the same headline for three days.
[00:55:49.189 --> 00:55:51.171]  That's the ultimate siren in red.
[00:55:51.311 --> 00:55:52.612]  Put it up from my tweet.
[00:55:52.652 --> 00:55:53.353]  I screenshotted it.
[00:55:53.713 --> 00:55:54.995]  That they cancelled the election.
[00:55:56.716 --> 00:55:59.278]  He says that... Put my tweet up, guys, please.
[00:55:59.799 --> 00:56:03.162]  He says that no one is reporting it.
[00:56:05.336 --> 00:56:17.622]  When all Drudge was doing was reporting that he stole it, and then he spins it and says, Drudge won't report I won Colorado to the audience of that radio show like they're fools!
[00:56:18.602 --> 00:56:26.426]  They accuse Drudge of lying to his readers and telling him that he didn't win Colorado in a democracy.
[00:56:26.506 --> 00:56:27.386]  I played that clip.
[00:56:29.427 --> 00:56:33.068]  And then Cruz goes, I guess it's okay if he doesn't want to tell his readers.
[00:56:33.189 --> 00:56:33.989]  Did you hear that?
[00:56:38.643 --> 00:56:43.265]  Because he doesn't want to say, Drudge is mad at me because we didn't let people vote, we cancelled the election.
[00:56:44.986 --> 00:56:50.008]  He says, Drudge won't tell you that the voters in a democracy gave me the vote and I won all 34.
[00:56:50.128 --> 00:56:57.291]  I mean, that is a new level of horse crap!
[00:56:59.772 --> 00:57:01.773]  This guy's a syph lord or something!
[00:57:03.775 --> 00:57:06.857]  I mean, I don't even know what to say anymore, people!
[00:57:07.638 --> 00:57:08.558]  I gotta stop right there.
[00:57:08.578 --> 00:57:18.245]  Our crew is going, Joe Biggs and Rob Doo and others are gonna speak, you name it, at the demonstration in Portland.
[00:57:19.619 --> 00:57:23.081]  Where the leftists say you're not allowed to have a demonstration, even though there are going to be speakers there.
[00:57:23.101 --> 00:57:24.643]  And they attack the Trump supporters.
[00:57:24.663 --> 00:57:25.183]  They're going to that.
[00:57:25.203 --> 00:57:26.184]  That's Saturday.
[00:57:26.224 --> 00:57:33.249]  The day before that, they're going to be, and I'll tell you about this next hour, they're going to be in Denver, where they've stolen, the RNC's stolen the votes.
[00:57:33.969 --> 00:57:36.611]  And so we're going to have live feeds covering it all, you name it, Friday and Saturday.
[00:57:38.112 --> 00:57:39.393]  We need funding, obviously.
[00:57:39.433 --> 00:57:48.820]  We sell the very best Hillary for prison t-shirts, the very best nutraceuticals, DNA Force, super male vitality, female vitality, nascent iodine, the good halogen x-tube.
[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:54.842]  We've got bone support formula, we've got joint support formulas, we've got just the best of everything.
[00:57:54.882 --> 00:58:03.846]  The best lung cleanse, essential oil spray out there, DNA forces back in stock, Cell Fusion, other great products.
[00:58:03.886 --> 00:58:05.907]  We've got the product there on the site.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:11.201]  Also, the Occupower that's got a lot of the same great stuff in it as well, but is a lot less expensive.
[00:58:11.521 --> 00:58:13.442]  Deep Cleanses back in, Brain Force.
[00:58:13.462 --> 00:58:15.303]  I think Anthroplex is sold out.
[00:58:15.703 --> 00:58:18.524]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:19.064 --> 00:58:31.348]  And listen, go there, buy the books, buy the videos, buy the non-GMO heirloom seeds, buy the Molon Lombe t-shirts, shop with the good guys, fund the operation, and I'm going to get a couple more reporters, a couple more camera people, and a couple more writers.
[00:58:32.468 --> 00:58:34.410]  We're able to fight on multi-fronts.
[00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:36.091]  Right now we're still understaffed.
[00:58:36.111 --> 00:58:37.433]  We're growing in the face of the enemy.
[00:58:37.453 --> 00:58:40.095]  We're putting the funds that come in back into the operation.
[00:58:40.395 --> 00:58:45.379]  We're putting on all sail in the fight to go to attack speed, ramming speed, and beyond.
[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:47.081]  Infowarslive.com.
[00:58:47.121 --> 00:58:47.561]  Go there.
[00:58:47.801 --> 00:58:48.782]  Support the Infowar.
[00:58:48.842 --> 00:58:49.743]  Buy the war bonds.
[00:58:49.963 --> 00:58:50.884]  Defeat the globalists.
[00:58:50.904 --> 00:58:51.705]  History's happening.
[00:58:51.945 --> 00:58:52.906]  It's incredibly exciting.
[00:58:52.966 --> 00:58:53.967]  Second hour straight ahead.
[00:58:54.027 --> 00:58:55.108]  Roger Stone joining us.
[00:58:55.388 --> 00:58:56.769]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:01.048 --> 00:59:10.072]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:59:10.132 --> 00:59:18.216]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:59:18.536 --> 00:59:23.221]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:59:23.401 --> 00:59:30.108]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:30.209 --> 00:59:37.296]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:59:37.376 --> 00:59:39.098]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[00:59:39.278 --> 00:59:44.261]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:59:44.401 --> 00:59:48.743]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:59:48.883 --> 00:59:52.125]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:59:52.265 --> 00:59:58.408]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:59:58.568 --> 01:00:00.789]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:04.911]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:22.543 --> 01:00:27.708]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:00:28.189 --> 01:00:30.431]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:50.068 --> 01:00:52.150]  I love humanity.
[01:00:52.210 --> 01:01:01.255]  That's what separates the good guys from the bad guys.
[01:01:01.335 --> 01:01:03.697]  That's what separates the men from the boys as well.
[01:01:04.718 --> 01:01:05.438]  Best part of the song.
[01:01:20.453 --> 01:01:21.313]  So alone.
[01:01:21.893 --> 01:01:23.014]  So alone.
[01:01:23.294 --> 01:01:25.734]  Motel money, murder madness.
[01:01:26.214 --> 01:01:28.435]  Motel money, murder madness.
[01:01:28.875 --> 01:01:31.556]  Man, I like that voice.
[01:01:31.696 --> 01:01:32.576]  I like Elvis.
[01:01:33.456 --> 01:01:34.656]  I like Jim Morrison.
[01:01:38.117 --> 01:01:39.698]  Somebody else has a voice kind of like that.
[01:01:40.298 --> 01:01:42.518]  Talk about the other day.
[01:01:42.538 --> 01:01:45.639]  Get your mojo rising.
[01:01:46.519 --> 01:01:49.640]  Gotta keep on riding, riding.
[01:01:51.363 --> 01:02:10.476]  Riding, riding, oh it's nothing like driving to the mountains, on a big stretch, straight away, in a sports car with 700 plus horsepower, with the moon setting behind the mountains, sun setting behind you, this song's playing, you ever had the sun and the moon at the same time up?
[01:02:12.377 --> 01:02:13.838]  And you're just blasting on the highway?
[01:02:16.088 --> 01:02:17.309]  And you know there's a God above?
[01:02:17.389 --> 01:02:18.590]  And you know there's all these mysteries?
[01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:20.211]  And you know it goes on and on?
[01:02:20.231 --> 01:02:21.432]  On and on and on?
[01:02:21.452 --> 01:02:23.113]  You're not afraid anymore?
[01:02:23.133 --> 01:02:26.856]  You transcend these parasites and these globalists?
[01:02:30.706 --> 01:02:32.647]  And you gotta keep on riding, riding.
[01:02:32.907 --> 01:02:38.250]  You gotta keep on being real, being genuine, being strong.
[01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:41.232]  Because all you know is you feel that honor of your ancestors.
[01:02:41.872 --> 01:02:46.134]  You feel all those good people before you set up for what was right and you want to keep that line going.
[01:02:46.615 --> 01:02:48.276]  You want to be one of those people, don't you?
[01:02:48.956 --> 01:02:49.476]  I know I do.
[01:02:52.578 --> 01:02:53.879]  Evil control freaks fear us.
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:59.962]  Because we're everything they wish they were and so much more.
[01:03:01.345 --> 01:03:03.547]  Fear not, my friends, as great evil comes upon us.
[01:03:04.828 --> 01:03:08.631]  Because this is the beginning of the great animating contest of liberty.
[01:03:12.113 --> 01:03:12.614]  You're livin' it.
[01:03:16.416 --> 01:03:16.877]  You're livin' it.
[01:03:17.137 --> 01:03:17.517]  Right now.
[01:03:24.262 --> 01:03:26.484]  Roger Stone's gonna join us coming up here in a few minutes.
[01:03:27.905 --> 01:03:30.087]  And as I tweeted earlier, he says it's the biggest news ever.
[01:03:34.349 --> 01:03:38.591]  The Cruz campaign has gone completely into insane asylum power grab mode.
[01:03:40.052 --> 01:03:47.417]  Cruz has unclogged himself, creamily licking his lips, discussing weeks ago the Bush endorsement and the full Bush crime family behind him.
[01:03:48.537 --> 01:03:50.018]  He finally has gotten their attention.
[01:03:50.058 --> 01:03:52.960]  They're finally knighting him and bringing him up.
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.722]  Probably just to throw him aside and put Kasich or Paul Ryan in.
[01:03:58.763 --> 01:04:01.945]  Because betrayal is the ether, the ocean.
[01:04:05.871 --> 01:04:18.096]  The atmosphere, the system, the world, the continuum, the reality in which traders swim.
[01:04:18.116 --> 01:04:28.200]  We're going to come back and talk to Roger Stone, and we are going to lay out where we're going, but I got to tell you one thing.
[01:04:29.218 --> 01:04:37.562]  The fact that they're trying to openly bamboozle the public and act like it's no big deal and that Ted Cruz goes on all these radio and TV shows and says it's a democracy.
[01:04:38.942 --> 01:04:42.724]  I won Colorado with the voters and Trump and
[01:04:44.525 --> 01:04:47.926]  Other groups, like Drudge, don't want to admit I'm winning fair and square.
[01:04:48.526 --> 01:04:49.446]  That's what he said earlier.
[01:04:49.466 --> 01:04:50.166]  We played the clip.
[01:04:50.666 --> 01:04:53.027]  This is a new level of spin.
[01:04:53.707 --> 01:04:55.127]  We don't think you're stupid here.
[01:04:55.167 --> 01:04:59.948]  We're giving you real complex analysis, not just dumbed down, I win Colorado!
[01:05:00.368 --> 01:05:04.069]  Trump not tell you, Drudge not tell you, I win!
[01:05:04.509 --> 01:05:05.329]  My toy!
[01:05:05.629 --> 01:05:09.870]  He like ran into a liquor store, grabbed a bottle of whiskey, ran out the door, the cops pulled him over and he says he bought it.
[01:05:10.603 --> 01:05:19.636]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:05:19.696 --> 01:05:27.827]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:05:28.107 --> 01:05:32.809]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:05:46.954 --> 01:05:53.796]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:05:53.976 --> 01:05:58.318]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:06:01.839 --> 01:06:07.982]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:06:08.122 --> 01:06:10.343]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:06:10.583 --> 01:06:12.123]  My name is Alex Jones.
[01:06:12.504 --> 01:06:18.426]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:06:18.646 --> 01:06:19.806]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[01:06:21.207 --> 01:06:35.333]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalists.
[01:06:35.733 --> 01:06:43.537]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[01:06:43.757 --> 01:06:50.180]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:51.461]  We're good to go.
[01:07:11.883 --> 01:07:13.164]  You can't survive without it.
[01:07:13.364 --> 01:07:14.265]  But where do you get it?
[01:07:14.566 --> 01:07:20.331]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:07:20.551 --> 01:07:26.296]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:07:26.477 --> 01:07:34.204]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities.
[01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:43.331]  Including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.

[01:07:46.194 --> 01:07:47.395]  Stainless steel construction.

[01:08:08.213 --> 01:08:16.781]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:17.141 --> 01:08:19.423]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:25.987 --> 01:08:29.629]  Paul Manafort is now all over international television.
[01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:32.731]  We're going to be getting him on the broadcast soon, obviously.
[01:08:32.751 --> 01:08:36.694]  He is the long-time business partner of Roger Stone.
[01:08:36.714 --> 01:08:42.798]  You can Google Roger Stone and Paul Manafort and you can see them way back in the Nixon days.
[01:08:43.639 --> 01:08:48.602]  They're meeting with some of their other counterparts and
[01:08:49.983 --> 01:08:54.024]  For eight, nine months, Roger Stone's been warning of the big steal, the plan to steal the delegates.
[01:08:54.104 --> 01:08:57.545]  Now Trump sees that's happening and is getting the right people in there.
[01:08:58.265 --> 01:09:13.589]  And as Politico and the New York Times recognize that Roger Stone and his expert cohorts are trying to shave our republic in the popular vote, they are turning incredible vitriol from Meet the Press to CNN against Stone.
[01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:15.590]  And we play these clips Friday.
[01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:16.470]  We played them yesterday.
[01:09:16.530 --> 01:09:17.551]  There's five or six of them.
[01:09:17.611 --> 01:09:23.094]  I'm not going to play them again today, where they play clips of him on the show where he says, no violence.
[01:09:23.674 --> 01:09:31.399]  We need to go to the delegations, though, that are public at the hotels and speak to them and say, please, you know, go with what you pledge to do.
[01:09:32.419 --> 01:09:40.544]  And there on screen is, of course, Mr. Stone, 45 year veteran of campaigns with Paul Manfort and others.
[01:09:41.817 --> 01:09:43.438]  We'll put that back on screen for TV viewers.
[01:09:43.478 --> 01:09:49.643]  If you're a radio listener, InfoWars.com forward slash show to find the feed so you can see a whole nother dimension of this broadcast.
[01:09:50.924 --> 01:09:53.646]  Now, and also he's there with Lee Atwater in that photo.
[01:09:54.887 --> 01:09:57.910]  They were there when they tried to steal it from Reagan and help stop it then.
[01:09:59.127 --> 01:10:01.568]  Manafort and Stone were the head guys that did it.
[01:10:01.968 --> 01:10:02.668]  So they're back.
[01:10:03.208 --> 01:10:11.710]  And whether you love Trump, hate Trump, or are in the middle, they're scared of him because he doesn't want unfair trade deals, he doesn't want globalism, he doesn't want open borders.
[01:10:12.010 --> 01:10:14.171]  So they're running fake headlines in the Boston Globe.
[01:10:14.571 --> 01:10:15.431]  They're lying.
[01:10:16.111 --> 01:10:23.733]  And they're saying that Roger Stone wants violence, and on a whole bunch of platforms, including the Washington Post,
[01:10:25.538 --> 01:10:36.638]  They've had Rick Tyler and others coming out and saying we should look at indicting when he arrives in Cleveland, Ohio.
[01:10:38.277 --> 01:10:39.058]  Roger Stone.
[01:10:39.138 --> 01:10:43.522]  So they're not just going to steal elections and cancel elections in Colorado and other states.
[01:10:44.203 --> 01:10:45.564]  They're now talking about arresting him.
[01:10:45.584 --> 01:10:46.565]  We'll put it back on screen.
[01:10:46.585 --> 01:10:48.006]  I want to read this to radio listeners.
[01:10:48.767 --> 01:10:52.650]  Could Donald Trump's surrogate, Roger Stone, be charged with menacing GOP convention delegates?
[01:10:53.011 --> 01:10:59.957]  You go to the red state sites and others, they're calling for his arrest and misrepresenting what he said on this show and others.
[01:11:00.958 --> 01:11:01.799]  And then it goes further.
[01:11:03.973 --> 01:11:06.394]  This isn't about Roger Stone.
[01:11:06.534 --> 01:11:12.977]  It's about someone out there who was the head of the campaign, who accurately warned Trump about what was going to happen.
[01:11:13.017 --> 01:11:13.637]  It has happened.
[01:11:14.097 --> 01:11:22.101]  Whose influence has now gone from strong to center stage with he and his business partner to save voting in this country.
[01:11:22.641 --> 01:11:24.242]  They're stealing from Bernie Sanders.
[01:11:24.482 --> 01:11:25.262]  He wins in Wyoming.
[01:11:25.302 --> 01:11:25.923]  He wins in New Hampshire.
[01:11:26.063 --> 01:11:26.503]  They take it.
[01:11:27.892 --> 01:11:33.735]  When he says he's going to go to his own delegates and try to get them to be honorable, the news says he's stealing it.
[01:11:34.395 --> 01:11:38.837]  So, if Bernie Sanders goes to his sworn delegates and tries to get them to do the right thing, he's stealing.
[01:11:38.877 --> 01:11:40.598]  That's in the New York Times today.
[01:11:40.958 --> 01:11:47.001]  If Roger Stone says he's going to go to delegates sworn to their voters to Trump, being stolen from Louisiana to Tennessee.
[01:11:48.621 --> 01:11:51.585]  Even when Trump wins and they have the election, they steal it after.
[01:11:52.125 --> 01:11:53.127]  That's criminal.
[01:11:53.207 --> 01:11:54.248]  That's intimidation.
[01:11:54.769 --> 01:12:01.017]  Ladies and gentlemen, once you go over the edge of cancelling elections and installing puppets, the next stage is arresting people.
[01:12:01.923 --> 01:12:02.944]  You go over an edge.
[01:12:02.984 --> 01:12:04.425]  Now, we're going to make big announcements here.
[01:12:04.445 --> 01:12:05.806]  He's with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:12:05.926 --> 01:12:10.690]  Roger Stone has been, you know, deep on the inside now of what's happening, battling for these delegates.
[01:12:11.171 --> 01:12:18.077]  He's going to give you the absolute, not five-minute, you know, blurb on CNN where he's banned, MSNBC where he's banned.
[01:12:18.317 --> 01:12:20.058]  He's now not really on Fox anymore.
[01:12:20.239 --> 01:12:21.940]  The Washington Post asked, why is he banned?
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.982]  He's one of the most articulate, accurate people.
[01:12:24.062 --> 01:12:24.923]  Even they understand.
[01:12:25.603 --> 01:12:32.165]  Because we're seeing political warfare this country's never seen since Lincoln, quite frankly, in my view.
[01:12:33.666 --> 01:12:35.246]  We have a new level we're going to cover as well.
[01:12:35.406 --> 01:12:37.027]  A lot of stations just joined us in the second hour.
[01:12:37.907 --> 01:12:44.709]  Ted Cruz has come out and said, Drudge is an attack dog run by Roger Stone and Donald Trump.
[01:12:46.284 --> 01:12:49.285]  And I won Colorado, and I won the democracy there.
[01:12:49.405 --> 01:12:50.125]  I won the votes.
[01:12:50.505 --> 01:12:51.486]  I have the clips coming up.
[01:12:52.226 --> 01:12:52.806]  Those are quotes.
[01:12:53.486 --> 01:12:56.267]  And Roger Stone and Drudge lied and said I didn't win.
[01:12:57.628 --> 01:12:58.868]  That is the new level of spin.
[01:12:58.908 --> 01:13:07.151]  They canceled the election, had the superdelegates ignore the delegates, pledge it all, 34 to him, and they're spinning it like Drudge is a liar.
[01:13:07.191 --> 01:13:07.911]  And then it gets worse.
[01:13:08.211 --> 01:13:13.893]  Phyllis Schlafly, the oldest living true patriot conservative in this country, been coming on my show 20 years.
[01:13:16.934 --> 01:13:21.415]  She had them try to take over her bank account and her role organization, Eagle Forum.
[01:13:21.595 --> 01:13:24.496]  They get True Patriots elected and shut her down.
[01:13:24.756 --> 01:13:29.277]  And it was reportedly a bunch of Cruz operatives, including her own daughter.
[01:13:30.097 --> 01:13:31.377]  But the bank wouldn't go along with it.
[01:13:31.397 --> 01:13:33.398]  And now reportedly there's criminal investigations.
[01:13:34.178 --> 01:13:36.359]  Folks, this is a new level.
[01:13:36.679 --> 01:13:39.379]  We've never seen theft like this of an election.
[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:42.560]  Roger Stone joins us to announce a new website, a new move.
[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:45.281]  He announced two weeks ago here first that he
[01:13:46.246 --> 01:13:48.073]  was going to lead and ask for my support.
[01:13:48.113 --> 01:13:48.435]  He hasn't.
[01:13:48.475 --> 01:13:51.647]  He has your support, obviously, and everybody else who stands for elections.
[01:13:52.739 --> 01:13:54.260]  There are people in my office who didn't support Trump.
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:56.763]  After this happened, they bought Trump hats and are now wearing them.
[01:13:57.483 --> 01:14:07.952]  Everyone, basically, is now for Trump in the office because they understand, folks, he is a figurehead for liberty and against globalism, and this man's life is in danger.
[01:14:07.992 --> 01:14:08.673]  We should pray for him.
[01:14:08.733 --> 01:14:12.657]  I am so honored to be associated with Matt Drudge, with Roger Stone, with Donald Trump.
[01:14:13.317 --> 01:14:14.398]  Real patriots.
[01:14:14.438 --> 01:14:17.781]  This is the attempted takeover of America you're witnessing.
[01:14:17.981 --> 01:14:18.582]  That's not hype!
[01:14:20.657 --> 01:14:30.260]  When they're taking over grassroots organizations that have been around 50 years covertly, Cruz, when they're canceling elections and then saying he won the popular vote, we have the clips, it is a new level.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:36.842]  So big announcements, big inside baseball with one of the top generals in the Trump campaign, outside the campaign.
[01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:42.734]  Which the enemy's figured out is central to the campaign, is now attacking him more than they're almost attacking Trump.
[01:14:43.115 --> 01:14:44.936]  And that's because they want to take him out, folks.
[01:14:45.457 --> 01:14:47.399]  Well, you're about to get to hearing for the next 45 minutes.
[01:14:47.439 --> 01:14:48.780]  Roger Stone, that's my intro.
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:51.943]  I know you've got big website, a big move you're about to announce.
[01:14:52.804 --> 01:14:53.825]  This is just epic.
[01:14:54.425 --> 01:14:55.306]  I'm on the edge of my seat.
[01:14:55.346 --> 01:14:57.328]  I've never been more excited to be on air.
[01:14:58.612 --> 01:15:03.076]  Well Alex, I'm wearing this hat as a homage to Matt Drudge.
[01:15:03.717 --> 01:15:06.640]  Because he's a guy who really did wreck the internet.
[01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:15.708]  He's broken into, as a pioneer, becoming a mass communicator who wasn't owned by a multinational corporation.
[01:15:16.449 --> 01:15:20.453]  And the idea that anyone controls Matt Drudge is offensive.
[01:15:20.993 --> 01:15:29.787]  He does a public service by picking up some of the best alternative and conservative media out there and spreading it to the masses.
[01:15:29.867 --> 01:15:33.172]  And by the way, for folks that don't know, Drudge, you're absolutely right.
[01:15:33.232 --> 01:15:35.456]  The way to not get something on Drudge is to tell him what to do.
[01:15:36.417 --> 01:15:42.660]  Not only that, but I would be honored if he posted everything of mine he ever sees, but I'm not that privileged.
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:52.665]  So, Ted Cruz, you know, he has a problem with the First Amendment, quite obviously, and this wild punch at either me or Matt Drudge is senseless.
[01:15:52.706 --> 01:16:01.230]  Look, there was a media uproar last week when I suggested that Trump supporters visit the hotels of delegates.
[01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:02.971]  Let me be a little more specific.
[01:16:04.158 --> 01:16:09.643]  From the beginning, the problem here has been one of Trojan delegates.
[01:16:10.004 --> 01:16:12.106]  Trojan horse delegates.
[01:16:12.726 --> 01:16:20.173]  These Trojan horse delegates are very specifically holding seats
[01:16:20.974 --> 01:16:21.254]  I think?
[01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:47.766]  On the question of rules, credentials, and platform, all of which must come before the first ballot for president.
[01:16:48.106 --> 01:17:04.394]  So even if Donald Trump has 1,237 votes, which under the capable leadership of Paul Manafort and the incredible talents as a candidate and a communicator of Donald Trump, I think they will have
[01:17:05.014 --> 01:17:08.639]  The establishment plans to steal this anyway.
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:15.087]  It is these Trojan horse delegates who will be central to the steal.
[01:17:15.568 --> 01:17:21.736]  What I suggest, quite frankly, is that each one of them be required to sign a loyalty pledge
[01:17:22.697 --> 01:17:31.661]  It's voluntary, of course, agreeing to stick with Donald Trump, the choice of the voters, the voters who elected that delegate.
[01:17:31.701 --> 01:17:35.503]  They should pledge to stand with the popular vote or move to North Korea.
[01:17:36.043 --> 01:17:36.383]  Correct.
[01:17:36.563 --> 01:17:44.987]  Now, you're not forced to sign, but if you won't sign, it will identify for the media who the quizlings are.
[01:17:45.147 --> 01:17:45.487]  That's right.
[01:17:45.547 --> 01:17:50.269]  If you're going to steal an election in America and cancel America, you better put your John Hancock on it.
[01:17:51.072 --> 01:17:56.837]  Right, so it exposes the bosses who are subverting the democratic process.
[01:17:57.217 --> 01:18:00.440]  Donald Trump is winning these primaries big.
[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:03.062]  This just in, he won Arkansas.
[01:18:03.702 --> 01:18:11.969]  Now there is a Cruz-Rubio alliance planning to block Donald Trump in Arkansas from getting his rightful majority.
[01:18:12.610 --> 01:18:17.294]  We've seen the strong arm tactics that were utilized in Colorado.
[01:18:17.834 --> 01:18:29.779]  We have seen a rare victory where Donald Trump and the forces loyal to John Kasich teamed together to block Ted Cruz out in Michigan.
[01:18:30.259 --> 01:18:35.081]  So two can play this game and I expect it's going to be hard fought right to the end.
[01:18:35.701 --> 01:18:37.462]  We are going to march on Cleveland.
[01:18:39.974 --> 01:18:45.899]  Delegations, we're going to ask every Trump delegate to sign the voluntary pledge.
[01:18:46.019 --> 01:18:48.681]  Are you with the voters or are you with the bosses?
[01:18:49.102 --> 01:18:55.347]  It's only elementary that Trump delegates should vote for Donald Trump and not against his interests.
[01:18:55.567 --> 01:18:56.588]  Let me stop you right there.
[01:18:56.668 --> 01:19:02.373]  Paul Manafort, your longtime partner that now basically, according to Politico, runs the campaign.
[01:19:02.413 --> 01:19:04.235]  I know you don't want to brag about it.
[01:19:05.069 --> 01:19:10.592]  But hopefully saving the campaign came out, as you know, and meet the press and said, look, they're breaking the rules.
[01:19:10.612 --> 01:19:11.292]  They've gone too far.
[01:19:11.312 --> 01:19:12.232]  We're going to file complaints.
[01:19:12.272 --> 01:19:14.373]  Look, it's one thing if there's a close elections.
[01:19:14.413 --> 01:19:18.015]  I've looked at the rules and then there's a brokered situation.
[01:19:18.335 --> 01:19:27.300]  But it's another thing when you just cancel elections altogether and then just have the party insiders tell you that Cruz won everything for me.
[01:19:28.484 --> 01:19:32.585]  We need to get out and educate the public that why do we get rid of Jim Crow and poll taxes?
[01:19:32.905 --> 01:19:35.425]  I mean, we have election laws for popular votes.
[01:19:35.725 --> 01:19:36.885]  There's public interest here.
[01:19:37.186 --> 01:19:41.146]  It's racketeering for the party to say, now popular votes don't count.
[01:19:41.406 --> 01:19:42.426]  This is unprecedented.
[01:19:42.826 --> 01:19:44.827]  And I think that Trump should press this.
[01:19:44.867 --> 01:19:48.728]  The problem is, watching mainstream TV, they won't show the full clip.
[01:19:49.028 --> 01:19:55.089]  They just show Trump saying, it's rigged, and then make a joke and say, well, he's just mad he didn't win Colorado.
[01:19:55.369 --> 01:19:56.849]  And they don't even tell people now.
[01:19:57.449 --> 01:20:04.063]  In some of these shows, I know you don't want to bash Fox because you're on there some, but I was watching Fox this morning, they wouldn't even say that there was no vote.
[01:20:04.744 --> 01:20:08.111]  So they've reached a new level, and that's the talking point from Cruz.
[01:20:09.525 --> 01:20:18.107]  Is he's running around saying, it's a democracy, I have the clip, played it last hour, I won Colorado, and Drudge won't report that I won Colorado.
[01:20:18.287 --> 01:20:18.467]  What?
[01:20:18.707 --> 01:20:19.908]  He reported you stole it!
[01:20:20.388 --> 01:20:34.031]  So from your expert understanding, and of course Paul's understanding of this, and he hinted at this on national television, is this not illegal, what's going on, or is this not a violation of the quote rules to just cancel things?
[01:20:35.009 --> 01:20:41.172]  Well, first of all, let me make very, very clear, yet again, that I have no formal nor informal role in the Donald Trump campaign.
[01:20:41.272 --> 01:20:43.213]  Paul Manafort is his own man.
[01:20:43.813 --> 01:20:44.993]  He's a skilled professional.
[01:20:45.053 --> 01:20:47.795]  I'm proud to say that we're partners for 15 years.
[01:20:47.815 --> 01:20:52.817]  I would point out that my other partner, who I hold in very high regard, Charlie Black,
[01:20:53.397 --> 01:21:00.141]  Very skilled operative, as shrewd as they come, now working for John Kasich, which is his constitutional right.
[01:21:00.821 --> 01:21:02.362]  He's not to be underestimated.
[01:21:02.442 --> 01:21:04.903]  He's a very clever guy who knows the rules.
[01:21:05.763 --> 01:21:13.367]  But I want to be very clear that Paul Manafort works for Donald Trump, and Donald Trump runs Donald Trump's campaign.
[01:21:13.948 --> 01:21:17.830]  I, Alex, am going to be outside the convention hall with you.
[01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:19.430]  With some bullhorns.
[01:21:19.791 --> 01:21:24.573]  And hopefully with thousands at the Stop the Steal march and rally.
[01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:30.275]  Now this is, to be very clear, a non-violent, peaceful protest.
[01:21:31.315 --> 01:21:34.497]  I was in the 1968 campaign for Richard Nixon.
[01:21:35.257 --> 01:21:43.802]  I understand that violence in Cleveland of any kind would be detrimental to Donald Trump's capability to win.
[01:21:43.842 --> 01:21:45.523]  You should not have proviso'd this.
[01:21:45.563 --> 01:21:46.404]  You never said this.
[01:21:46.424 --> 01:21:47.525]  They're running fake headlines.
[01:21:47.765 --> 01:21:48.926]  How do we counter them lying?
[01:21:48.986 --> 01:21:50.186]  Everybody must come to Cleveland.
[01:21:50.427 --> 01:21:53.909]  Everybody must go to Denver this Friday to protest at the RNC as well.
[01:21:54.149 --> 01:21:54.749]  The big steal.
[01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:59.112]  Yeah, so when they say, why do you want to visit the hotel rooms of delegates?
[01:21:59.172 --> 01:21:59.852]  It's very simple.
[01:22:00.633 --> 01:22:01.834]  I want them to sign the pledge.
[01:22:02.904 --> 01:22:09.767]  I respect if they don't want to sign the pledge, that's their right, but the voters elected them to vote for Donald Trump.
[01:22:09.827 --> 01:22:10.967]  That's our democracy.
[01:22:11.507 --> 01:22:22.612]  So if the bosses have put them into a Trump seat, Texas for example, where the delegation does not include a single actual Trump supporter, not one.
[01:22:23.626 --> 01:22:34.481]  Because George P. Bush and Rick Perry and Ted Cruz have ganged up to ensure that they control the Texas delegation on questions of rules and credentials.
[01:22:34.922 --> 01:22:36.624]  That's where the big steal will take place.
[01:22:39.071 --> 01:22:39.671]  Unprecedented.
[01:22:39.691 --> 01:22:42.312]  You talked about breaking some of the biggest news ever today.
[01:22:42.352 --> 01:22:43.233]  I put it out on Twitter.
[01:22:43.573 --> 01:22:50.116]  Roger Stone, the man that the Republicans establishment once arrested, is going to break some of the biggest news ever on the broadcast.
[01:22:50.796 --> 01:22:54.617]  I know that you're launching TrumpBallotSecurity.org.
[01:22:55.318 --> 01:22:57.279]  Tell us about TrumpBallotSecurity.org.
[01:22:57.319 --> 01:22:59.619]  We're going to tweet that out and some of the other plans.
[01:22:59.639 --> 01:23:03.281]  And then you always know weeks and months ahead of time what's going to happen.
[01:23:03.881 --> 01:23:05.402]  Tell us the next shoe to drop.
[01:23:06.274 --> 01:23:12.377]  Well, here, Alex, is the breaking news before we talk about some of the important projects that will help Donald Trump.
[01:23:13.898 --> 01:23:21.281]  Ted Cruz has continually given the impression that he has some kind of inside track with the Rubio delegates.
[01:23:21.862 --> 01:23:27.384]  As you know, Marco Rubio requested that his delegates not be released.
[01:23:27.444 --> 01:23:29.285]  He has in excess of 100 delegates.
[01:23:31.086 --> 01:23:40.494]  Those delegates are obviously going to play a very large role, as well as the 230 delegates who are unpledged.
[01:23:41.515 --> 01:23:46.479]  This is where I think all sides will be wooing those delegates.
[01:23:46.559 --> 01:23:49.621]  They're going to be hearing from Donald Trump Jr., I imagine.
[01:23:49.641 --> 01:23:50.782]  They'll hear from Ivanka.
[01:23:51.543 --> 01:23:53.685]  Some of them may hear directly from Donald Trump.
[01:23:54.385 --> 01:23:57.328]  The Trump family is Donald Trump's greatest asset.
[01:23:58.008 --> 01:24:05.230]  They have a special tonight with Anderson Cooper, where you'll be able to see the Trump family in an interview, I believe it is.
[01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:13.912]  So it is an important part of this strategy to focus on those very delegates.
[01:24:13.993 --> 01:24:21.595]  Now, Ted Cruz has maintained that he somehow has an inside track on those delegates, that those delegates would never vote for Donald Trump.
[01:24:23.095 --> 01:24:31.723]  Definitively, that Senator Rubio did not ask for the non-release of those delegates as a favor to Ted Cruz.
[01:24:31.783 --> 01:24:40.670]  That those delegates, based on a survey of them that has been done by experienced people, indicates that they're loyal to Senator Marco Rubio.
[01:24:41.611 --> 01:24:44.254]  They have no great high regard for Ted Cruz.
[01:24:44.855 --> 01:24:49.479]  They're not Trump supporters, but they are also not not Trump supporters.
[01:24:49.519 --> 01:24:56.707]  So the idea that Rubio has a corner here is a falsehood that his agents continue to spread.
[01:24:57.227 --> 01:25:00.130]  I don't know where these important votes will ultimately end up.
[01:25:01.031 --> 01:25:08.675]  I was encouraged to see that the senator decided to hold his delegation.
[01:25:09.475 --> 01:25:12.136]  He did not receive the endorsement of Jeb Bush.
[01:25:13.417 --> 01:25:21.480]  There is bad blood between Marco and Bush because he had the audacity to pursue his constitutional right to run for office.
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:27.023]  You know, Alex, as Teddy Roosevelt said, the credit belongs to the man who gets in the arena.
[01:25:28.491 --> 01:25:31.995]  Not the man who stands on the side and points out where the strongman stumbles.
[01:25:32.415 --> 01:25:35.218]  I give Marco credit for just running the gauntlet.
[01:25:35.639 --> 01:25:36.239]  For trying.
[01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:41.104]  He wasn't successful, but he at least deserves our respect for the effort.
[01:25:41.324 --> 01:25:50.173]  So, some of the big breaking news here is, and I know you've been in these meetings the last few days, I mean, you've been eyes on the ball in person, if I can go that far.
[01:25:50.914 --> 01:26:13.380]  That Rubio is not pledged to Cruz, Cruz is lying, and that Rubio's huge amount of delegates are up for grabs, and hey, Donald Trump and his crew, and Paul Manafort and others, have a lot of tricks up their sleeves that aren't dirty, but are going to be able to block some of the establishment punches being thrown at this free and open election that
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:19.206]  If this was a normal election, Trump would already be, obviously, the nominee and people would be getting behind him.
[01:26:19.446 --> 01:26:25.533]  But the Republicans have said, the head of the Republican Party in Colorado has said in a tweet, I'm ready to burn down the party, let's do it.
[01:26:26.414 --> 01:26:28.076]  I mean, for me, this is just incredible.
[01:26:28.962 --> 01:26:35.607]  That these individuals are clearly operatives wanting to make a one-party system and basically globalize things.
[01:26:35.647 --> 01:26:39.570]  They've already moved on wanting jobs at the UN or jobs at the IMF or World Bank.
[01:26:40.171 --> 01:26:41.992]  And these people are just open traitors.
[01:26:42.032 --> 01:26:43.173]  I think this is sedition.
[01:26:43.693 --> 01:26:47.736]  This is private parties working together to create an oligarchy.
[01:26:48.417 --> 01:26:49.958]  And I don't say this for rhetoric.
[01:26:49.978 --> 01:26:54.622]  You're the one they're wanting to arrest for saying we should, you know, exercise our First Amendment and demonstrate
[01:26:55.402 --> 01:26:56.702]  I think this is criminal.
[01:26:56.722 --> 01:26:58.743]  I mean, this is an attempt to take the country over.
[01:26:59.563 --> 01:27:00.843]  This is a racketeering.
[01:27:00.903 --> 01:27:03.884]  This makes Jim Crow look like a blessing.
[01:27:04.584 --> 01:27:10.226]  I mean, I know that I don't have rhetoric strong enough is what I'm saying, Roger, to describe the climate these people have entered into.
[01:27:10.506 --> 01:27:12.447]  I mean, what can we really say about Ted Cruz?
[01:27:12.547 --> 01:27:15.807]  I liked Ted Cruz six months ago, but this guy is just a monster.
[01:27:16.248 --> 01:27:17.928]  Phyllis Schlafly, I mean, it just goes on and on.
[01:27:22.386 --> 01:27:23.687]  And his Skype just paused.
[01:27:23.747 --> 01:27:26.449]  We'll get him to load back up here in just a moment.
[01:27:26.509 --> 01:27:29.611]  I mean, people, this is crazy.
[01:27:30.552 --> 01:27:38.617]  And then Cruz going out with these talking points that he won and why is Trump mad?
[01:27:38.637 --> 01:27:41.619]  And then he won't say it's because they stole the election?
[01:27:42.279 --> 01:27:44.781]  And not just Colorado, now they're announcing four other states?
[01:27:45.702 --> 01:27:46.682]  It's in the Washington Post.
[01:27:46.783 --> 01:27:48.123]  Oh, that's just a new thing.
[01:27:48.684 --> 01:27:49.364]  We don't have votes.
[01:27:50.585 --> 01:27:51.646]  We're getting a Skype reconnected.
[01:27:55.689 --> 01:27:57.369]  And look, it's crazy.
[01:27:57.470 --> 01:28:08.212]  Matt Drudge is being attacked because he links to the local paper, the Denver Post, saying that the election was canceled, the state and voters don't get to vote.
[01:28:09.353 --> 01:28:13.914]  I mean, how is Matt Drudge not supposed to link to that?
[01:28:13.974 --> 01:28:15.594]  That's sensational news.
[01:28:16.575 --> 01:28:18.935]  That's a seismic event in American politics.
[01:28:19.536 --> 01:28:20.456]  Your Skype's back, sir.
[01:28:20.476 --> 01:28:22.116]  At least it looks like it's somewhat stabilized.
[01:28:22.136 --> 01:28:23.056]  We may have to go to phone.
[01:28:24.037 --> 01:28:24.737]  Roger, can you hear me?
[01:28:27.679 --> 01:28:29.641]  Yeah, we're having some distortion here.
[01:28:29.661 --> 01:28:32.423]  I think the NSA is probably monitoring this.
[01:28:32.924 --> 01:28:34.165]  Oh, you think they're messing with the election?
[01:28:34.205 --> 01:28:35.246]  I think that's probably the case.
[01:28:35.506 --> 01:28:37.428]  But seriously, Roger Stone, we're going to break here in a moment.
[01:28:38.108 --> 01:28:39.229]  What would you call this?
[01:28:39.269 --> 01:28:40.790]  Because I think it's a criminal takeover.
[01:28:40.810 --> 01:28:42.972]  I think it's unprecedented what they're doing.
[01:28:43.052 --> 01:28:46.996]  The spin machine, the deception level, where Cruz is saying it's a democracy.
[01:28:47.056 --> 01:28:48.097]  I got the popular vote.
[01:28:48.297 --> 01:28:50.159]  We have the clip in Colorado.
[01:28:50.179 --> 01:28:51.520]  I mean, this is a new level of lying.
[01:28:52.694 --> 01:29:09.184]  Well, also, let's realize that there are some interpretations of the law that indicate that because this is a race for party office and not public office, that actual buying of delegates for cash would not necessarily be illegal.
[01:29:09.324 --> 01:29:12.666]  Now, in the 30s and 40s, this was very common.
[01:29:13.426 --> 01:29:19.090]  I've not heard of anything like this in recent conventions, but I put nothing behind the oil and gas
[01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:22.911]  ...interests who are funding Ted Cruz's campaign.
[01:29:22.951 --> 01:29:29.133]  This guy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the energy industry, with a Bush lineage.
[01:29:29.753 --> 01:29:46.198]  And when I've exposed his key role in the election, and the policies of George W. Bush, and his wife's ties to the CFR, Goldman Sachs, and the insiders, and Matt Drudge chooses to put them up, it goes out of his mind.
[01:29:46.823 --> 01:29:52.948]  That's right, because he's a total sleeper agent of the Rockefeller East Coast Republicans that we've been trying to get rid of for 40 years.
[01:29:53.288 --> 01:29:54.609]  Roger Stone straight ahead.
[01:29:54.629 --> 01:30:00.474]  TrumpBallotSecurity.org StopTheSteal.org We're on the march.
[01:30:00.935 --> 01:30:02.536]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.457 --> 01:30:06.139]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:11.073 --> 01:30:14.398]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[01:30:14.538 --> 01:30:16.822]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[01:30:16.982 --> 01:30:25.315]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:30:25.595 --> 01:30:28.937]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[01:30:29.097 --> 01:30:39.582]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:30:39.762 --> 01:30:47.045]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:30:47.245 --> 01:30:49.106]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:30:49.466 --> 01:30:57.114]  Supermail Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:30:57.414 --> 01:31:03.580]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:10.827]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Supermail Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:31:11.067 --> 01:31:12.089]  Brain Force is here.
[01:31:12.610 --> 01:31:14.914]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:31:15.175 --> 01:31:22.989]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[01:31:23.755 --> 01:31:26.957]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[01:31:27.197 --> 01:31:27.337]  Right?
[01:31:27.357 --> 01:31:29.699]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[01:31:30.059 --> 01:31:33.582]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[01:31:33.642 --> 01:31:36.764]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[01:31:37.264 --> 01:31:42.067]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[01:31:42.608 --> 01:31:44.429]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[01:31:44.789 --> 01:31:49.232]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[01:31:49.372 --> 01:31:51.394]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[01:31:51.994 --> 01:31:53.455]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[01:31:53.615 --> 01:31:53.855]  Exactly.
[01:31:53.875 --> 01:31:57.659]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[01:31:58.179 --> 01:32:05.445]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:33:08.393 --> 01:33:16.137]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide
[01:33:20.703 --> 01:33:21.783]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:33:40.834 --> 01:33:44.416]  Longtime buddy, wingman, you name it.
[01:33:44.436 --> 01:33:44.796]  800-259-9231.
[01:33:44.816 --> 01:33:45.276]  800-259-9231.
[01:33:45.396 --> 01:33:52.120]  Really just Trump's 40-something year buddy.
[01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:54.161]  Another one of his friends of 40 years.
[01:33:54.241 --> 01:33:56.882]  Not as close, but knew him in the construction and banking.
[01:33:57.702 --> 01:33:59.963]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, a big heavy hitter.
[01:34:00.144 --> 01:34:02.265]  Three-time number one New York Times bestseller.
[01:34:02.665 --> 01:34:04.646]  The guy that deep-sixed John Kerry.
[01:34:06.053 --> 01:34:15.676]  He knows Trump, and he says Trump knows more than he and I do combined about the New World Order, and that Trump basically has been playing possum with the establishment, and that's why they're freaking out.
[01:34:16.096 --> 01:34:22.759]  He said that last time he was on three weeks ago, and I was like, wow, because I had other people tell me this years ago, that Donald Trump was this big patriot.
[01:34:23.559 --> 01:34:24.419]  And I was like, what?
[01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:25.480]  Donald Trump?
[01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:27.981]  That's the casino owner, the hotel owner, the developer.
[01:34:29.001 --> 01:34:31.642]  You know, flashy stuff on TV, kind of pop stuff.
[01:34:32.421 --> 01:34:37.604]  Well, I learned he gave hundreds of thousands over the years against NAFTA and GATT, against unfair deals for America.
[01:34:37.944 --> 01:34:40.265]  Even though he wasn't in those businesses, it really made him mad.
[01:34:41.046 --> 01:34:42.246]  He just loves America.
[01:34:42.286 --> 01:34:43.047]  He's not perfect.
[01:34:43.687 --> 01:34:47.189]  He doesn't want to screw us over under globalism and have Chinese 35% tariffs.
[01:34:48.429 --> 01:34:49.710]  That's why we've got to get behind Trump.
[01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:55.013]  The whole system we say we hate is melting down, pulling out the stops, cancelling elections.
[01:34:57.266 --> 01:34:57.466]  800-259-9231.
[01:34:57.486 --> 01:35:02.470]  800-259-9231 is the number to join us.
[01:35:03.190 --> 01:35:08.053]  And we're also going to give you those websites again, so you can get involved and stop the steal.
[01:35:08.534 --> 01:35:09.675]  TrumpBallotSecurity.org.
[01:35:09.715 --> 01:35:10.935]  We're going to talk about that in a moment.
[01:35:11.556 --> 01:35:20.782]  Phyllis Schlafly having the Cruz Stoats and Ferrets and Rats and Weasels get into her operation, trying to take it over yesterday.
[01:35:20.882 --> 01:35:22.043]  I mean, that's in World Net Daily.
[01:35:22.703 --> 01:35:24.484]  Of course, he talked to her.
[01:35:24.564 --> 01:35:26.526]  My board plotted to fire me over Trump.
[01:35:27.106 --> 01:35:33.709]  I mean, folks, they're getting us thrown off radio stations over this, even though the station managers like Trump were getting good ratings.
[01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:37.391]  They are moving for the takeover and create a one-party system.
[01:35:37.411 --> 01:35:37.931]  This is it.
[01:35:38.652 --> 01:35:41.653]  And Trump is just a manifestation of how they're going to counter populism.
[01:35:42.434 --> 01:35:44.755]  Briefly, you need to understand the Bushes.
[01:35:44.855 --> 01:35:49.897]  People have read this book that are experts on the Bushes, other authors, and it's a new level.
[01:35:50.578 --> 01:35:54.640]  Jeb Bush and the Bush crime family, the inside story of American dynasty Roger Stone,
[01:35:55.891 --> 01:35:56.252]  And St.
[01:35:56.312 --> 01:36:02.159]  John Hunt, and a forward by Congressman John LeBoutelier, if I'm pronouncing that right.
[01:36:02.199 --> 01:36:08.047]  The point is, I've read it, it's over-the-top powerful, understand the whole power structure, and the Clinton's war on women.
[01:36:08.127 --> 01:36:11.592]  New national polls out show Trump in a dead heat with Hillary, or ahead of her.
[01:36:13.373 --> 01:36:14.775]  He brings this out, it's over.
[01:36:15.236 --> 01:36:20.704]  So both these books available at Infowarsstore.com and your purchase supports the broadcast.
[01:36:21.364 --> 01:36:25.731]  Separately, we have DNA Force that is the strongest, most powerful nutraceutical out there.
[01:36:26.151 --> 01:36:28.795]  It has the true, naturally produced bio PQQ.
[01:36:30.177 --> 01:36:41.033]  CoQ10, resveratrol, the list goes on and on, souped up with the key patented amino acids to have your body upload it directly to the mitochondrial DNA.
[01:36:41.233 --> 01:36:45.319]  This is the stuff they've got, you know, in German labs that people pay $600 a bottle for.
[01:36:47.737 --> 01:36:49.019]  It is the true game changer.
[01:36:49.059 --> 01:36:50.120]  It's why it's such a bestseller.
[01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:51.062]  It's back in stock.
[01:36:51.102 --> 01:36:55.127]  Very hard to procure these California purity levels, but we do it.
[01:36:55.548 --> 01:37:01.816]  It's very hard to have a multi-system like this with this many things in it that's completely pure and non-detectable or down to California levels.
[01:37:02.537 --> 01:37:04.079]  Infowarslife.com
[01:37:07.617 --> 01:37:15.360]  InfoWarsStore.com and we're going to have our crew in Denver Friday for the demonstration at the RNC for the big steal.
[01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:18.481]  We're going to have them in Portland where the left has said no First Amendment allowed.
[01:37:18.501 --> 01:37:20.342]  We're going to be battling hard.
[01:37:20.642 --> 01:37:22.003]  Rob Dew and Joe Biggs and others.
[01:37:23.314 --> 01:37:26.257]  Everybody should wear their Hillary for Prison shirts, their Mullen Lobby shirts.
[01:37:26.337 --> 01:37:32.183]  You hear the leftist fascists go, and just foam in fear.
[01:37:32.604 --> 01:37:37.929]  And after they attacked the six people that were at Oregon State, they're in Portland.
[01:37:38.570 --> 01:37:42.151]  They said, no, you don't come back with the faculty doing it, saying there's no free speech here.
[01:37:42.211 --> 01:37:43.272]  Well, we need a bunch of people to go.
[01:37:43.292 --> 01:37:44.892]  There are going to be speakers that are listed.
[01:37:44.932 --> 01:37:45.913]  I'm sure we'll try to ban them.
[01:37:46.173 --> 01:37:47.573]  And the schools say no First Amendment.
[01:37:47.633 --> 01:37:49.554]  You need to be wearing your Molon Labe shirts.
[01:37:49.814 --> 01:37:54.956]  You need to be there to stand for the First Amendment and really expose the tyranny of these anti-free speech people.
[01:37:55.316 --> 01:38:02.100]  We're about to go back to Roger Stone right now, but don't forget Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com.
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:08.663]  Don't forget, your purchases make it all possible for this platform to fight for tyranny and support our local affiliates.
[01:38:08.683 --> 01:38:09.043]  All right.
[01:38:10.264 --> 01:38:18.848]  Also, you can visit Roger Stone's own personal website that's excellent with news updates and videos, the latest Trump inside info, stonezone.com.
[01:38:19.589 --> 01:38:19.729]  Now,
[01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:24.852]  Going back to Mr. Stone while his Skype holds, they're from sunny Florida.
[01:38:25.973 --> 01:38:40.123]  We still haven't covered a laundry list, the Phyllis Schlafly attack, other dirty tricks, what's coming next, and then I want to also get into some calls and call for people again to get ready to get your apartment rented or whatever or a nearby town.
[01:38:40.243 --> 01:38:41.624]  Be in Cleveland.
[01:38:41.684 --> 01:38:42.405]  Book it now.
[01:38:42.725 --> 01:38:43.166]  Commit.
[01:38:43.406 --> 01:38:44.046]  This is history.
[01:38:44.146 --> 01:38:44.827]  I'm going to be there.
[01:38:45.427 --> 01:38:46.048]  Roger Stone.
[01:38:48.527 --> 01:38:56.833]  Well Alex, first I really must address the question of those advocating that I be either arrested or banned from the convention.
[01:38:57.434 --> 01:39:04.179]  So, the establishment wants to take away my right of free speech, my constitutional right of free assembly, and free association.
[01:39:04.799 --> 01:39:06.120]  On the basis of what evidence?
[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:07.802]  I never called for violence.
[01:39:08.382 --> 01:39:16.445]  If CNN and Megyn Kelly were honest, they would play the very next sentence in which I talk about the importance of a dialogue with the delegates.
[01:39:16.885 --> 01:39:18.806]  But of course, they don't do that.
[01:39:18.946 --> 01:39:22.307]  So, it's something you would expect from the Nazis.
[01:39:22.367 --> 01:39:23.467]  First, we're banning people.
[01:39:23.847 --> 01:39:24.848]  Then we're banning books.
[01:39:25.228 --> 01:39:26.188]  Then we're banning movies.
[01:39:26.248 --> 01:39:27.809]  Next, we're burning books.
[01:39:28.209 --> 01:39:29.590]  This is a very slippery slope.
[01:39:29.650 --> 01:39:30.490]  Then we're burning people.
[01:39:31.753 --> 01:39:33.794]  It's entirely anti-free speech.
[01:39:33.874 --> 01:39:46.958]  Look, I above all know that any violence in Cleveland is detrimental to my ultimate goal, the election of Donald Trump and the takedown... But it's been the Soros and the Democrats and the Republican operatives attacking Trump rallies.
[01:39:47.198 --> 01:39:48.539]  We're not the ones that are violent.
[01:39:49.266 --> 01:39:49.786]  Exactly.
[01:39:50.247 --> 01:39:52.908]  So I think it's important that we touch on that.
[01:39:52.968 --> 01:39:58.151]  Look, Alex, I think you really expressed the importance, and that is the March on Cleveland.
[01:39:59.072 --> 01:40:00.052]  Details to come.
[01:40:00.113 --> 01:40:01.093]  The March and Rally.
[01:40:01.393 --> 01:40:03.735]  You can go to StopTheSteal.org.
[01:40:04.235 --> 01:40:07.137]  This will be information central on all the details.
[01:40:07.737 --> 01:40:12.960]  We are seeking to raise enough money to run buses from all over the United States.
[01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:19.104]  We are in negotiations with a couple of colleges that are out of session for dormitory space.
[01:40:19.464 --> 01:40:26.288]  We're trying to access some other inexpensive housing for the marshals, for the organizers.
[01:40:26.628 --> 01:40:28.349]  We've had tremendous reception.
[01:40:28.789 --> 01:40:36.493]  From the Trump supporters in Ohio and Pennsylvania and Delaware, they're already committed to carloads of bodies.
[01:40:36.893 --> 01:40:45.198]  So as I've said previously, whether you have to walk, hitchhike, bus, take a train, or if you can afford to fly, come to Cleveland.
[01:40:45.598 --> 01:40:46.238]  It's important.
[01:40:46.338 --> 01:40:48.159]  And you are a guy that gets results.
[01:40:48.279 --> 01:40:53.641]  You stopped Reagan getting robbed with your partner, Paul, now heading up the campaign at many levels.
[01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:55.902]  You helped stop Al Gore getting in.
[01:40:55.922 --> 01:40:58.503]  You can say Bush stole it and you turned against Bush later because he's corrupt.
[01:40:58.663 --> 01:40:59.243]  They're both corrupt.
[01:40:59.283 --> 01:40:59.563]  Whatever.
[01:40:59.743 --> 01:41:00.963]  Point is, you know what you're doing.
[01:41:01.204 --> 01:41:02.324]  You've got a real battle plan.
[01:41:02.604 --> 01:41:05.665]  This is the place people need to put their time, their energy, and their money.
[01:41:05.905 --> 01:41:06.746]  Commit now.
[01:41:06.986 --> 01:41:08.646]  You're going to Cleveland, folks.
[01:41:08.886 --> 01:41:10.087]  It's a march on tyranny.
[01:41:11.127 --> 01:41:13.389]  It's a march against the people that want to steal this country.
[01:41:13.429 --> 01:41:18.252]  It's a march on the state apparatus, the would-be Republican Party Politburo.
[01:41:19.674 --> 01:41:38.350]  And again, I say, if you're coming and you're a Trump supporter, the Soros-funded agents provocateur, the agitprop, the demonstrators with the faux protest, who are sometimes wearing Bernie Sanders t-shirts but aren't Bernie supporters, they are going to try to incite violence.
[01:41:38.410 --> 01:41:41.592]  We're going to digital photo them into a Google image scan.
[01:41:41.632 --> 01:41:42.713]  We always blow their cover.
[01:41:42.893 --> 01:41:43.554]  This will backfire.
[01:41:44.346 --> 01:41:47.010]  Yes, and it's essential that you ignore their taunts.
[01:41:47.410 --> 01:41:49.734]  They want violence, so they can blame it on us.
[01:41:50.215 --> 01:41:50.775]  Ignore them.
[01:41:51.276 --> 01:41:53.920]  Find your delegates, ask them respectfully to
[01:41:54.904 --> 01:41:58.386]  You are so extreme to say that we should demonstrate on behalf of voting rights.
[01:41:58.486 --> 01:42:01.067]  You're probably one of those guys that wanted black people to be able to vote.
[01:42:01.087 --> 01:42:02.248]  I mean, you know, how dare you?
[01:42:18.374 --> 01:42:22.899]  We have to stop what is, in fact, the hijacking of the Republican Party.
[01:42:22.959 --> 01:42:37.693]  Now, again, the best news today is not that Ted Cruz claimed the endorsement of Marco Rubio or the formal support of his delegates, but what he's spinning is that he has the majority of them.
[01:42:38.474 --> 01:42:40.056]  Uh, and that is not accurate.
[01:42:40.076 --> 01:42:43.240]  I think those delegates are loyal to Marco Rubio.
[01:42:43.881 --> 01:42:46.064]  Uh, and there's many fine people in that delegation.
[01:42:46.124 --> 01:42:49.768]  So, let's see, uh, you know, when we get to Cleveland.
[01:42:49.828 --> 01:42:51.991]  But, this is typical of Cruz.
[01:42:52.051 --> 01:42:55.475]  This is why, of course, Donald calls him Lion Ted.
[01:42:56.576 --> 01:43:04.262]  He continues to lie about me on Fox, on CNN, claiming that I planted the National Enquirer stories.
[01:43:04.782 --> 01:43:11.486]  Sadly, those outlets, Fox gave me an opportunity to respond, but CNN has never allowed me to respond.
[01:43:11.506 --> 01:43:13.888]  So he can attack me, but I can't respond.
[01:43:14.348 --> 01:43:21.753]  Fortunately, I can come here to Infowars.com and reach four times as many people as would see me on MSNBC.
[01:43:21.853 --> 01:43:23.294]  So I'm blessed.
[01:43:23.455 --> 01:43:24.155]  I'm really blessed.
[01:43:24.195 --> 01:43:25.235]  Well, that's another question.
[01:43:25.875 --> 01:43:38.018]  This moment in media where the Republican and Democratic Party leaderships together, where the big channels are merging, where Obama's now on Fox News, Hillary's now great on Fox News, all this craziness is going on, all the system's powers against it.
[01:43:38.639 --> 01:43:41.339]  MSNBC's biggest shows have like 300-400,000 viewers.
[01:43:41.699 --> 01:43:42.360]  They're a joke.
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:47.501]  They're lying, thinking they're in a vacuum, and no one knows they're lying, but everyone knows.
[01:43:47.881 --> 01:43:51.762]  In your next breath, you said, go to Cleveland, go knock on their doors, talk to the delegates,
[01:43:52.082 --> 01:43:54.584]  And try to get them to follow their pledge, but don't be violent.
[01:43:55.364 --> 01:43:57.365]  Everyone knows they're lying.
[01:43:57.726 --> 01:43:58.966]  Don't they understand that?
[01:43:58.986 --> 01:44:04.270]  And now they're announcing billionaires with a bigger double down against Trump with ads.
[01:44:04.350 --> 01:44:07.291]  I mean, I've never seen them throw all their power against somebody.
[01:44:07.852 --> 01:44:09.233]  What about the arrogance of the media?
[01:44:09.253 --> 01:44:11.034]  Do they realize how bad they're damaging themselves?
[01:44:12.268 --> 01:44:14.809]  You know, I think they will do anything to stop an outsider.
[01:44:14.889 --> 01:44:23.992]  The entire establishment fear, and this includes the multinational corporation owned media, the Washington insiders, particularly the lobbyists.
[01:44:24.613 --> 01:44:27.013]  The lobbyists who work for the donor class.
[01:44:27.454 --> 01:44:30.135]  That's exactly who the plotters are here.
[01:44:30.555 --> 01:44:33.436]  And they're petrified by the idea of a nationalist
[01:44:34.276 --> 01:44:39.497]  Who opposes their international trade deals that get them cheap labor and make our streets unsafe.
[01:44:40.077 --> 01:44:46.158]  Who opposes their fiscal hokery in which we're broke and they're always poking the books.
[01:44:46.618 --> 01:44:47.918]  We go deeper and deeper in debt.
[01:44:48.339 --> 01:44:51.599]  Trump is a believer in American sovereignty.
[01:44:51.999 --> 01:44:54.200]  He's not for the global game plan.
[01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:56.060]  And that's his sin.
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:57.380]  And that is his sin.
[01:44:58.140 --> 01:45:00.481]  And they will stop at nothing.
[01:45:00.621 --> 01:45:01.661]  In all honesty, Alex,
[01:45:02.725 --> 01:45:05.649]  California is the big enchilada.
[01:45:06.530 --> 01:45:13.919]  California could be as important to the nomination of Donald Trump as it was to the nomination of Barry Goldwater.
[01:45:14.459 --> 01:45:17.223]  The last outsider they nominated for president.
[01:45:17.263 --> 01:45:21.028]  Is the establishment crazy enough to change some rule and try to cancel that election?
[01:45:21.974 --> 01:45:23.315]  Well, I would say this.
[01:45:23.735 --> 01:45:29.238]  I think California will go forward, but this is one of the most expensive states in the nation to compete.
[01:45:29.998 --> 01:45:36.102]  The corporately funded Ted Cruz super PACs will funnel $25-30 million in.
[01:45:37.102 --> 01:45:43.046]  He is actively on the ground, but you also see a major push from John Kasich.
[01:45:43.126 --> 01:45:44.727]  Again, I am one.
[01:45:45.407 --> 01:45:51.851]  Disagreeing with Donald Trump, who thinks it is beneficial to have the opposition to Trump split.
[01:45:52.251 --> 01:45:54.873]  John Kasich has every right to stay in this race.
[01:45:55.413 --> 01:45:56.574]  He got in the arena.
[01:45:56.874 --> 01:45:57.894]  He worked very hard.
[01:45:57.974 --> 01:45:59.315]  He won some delegates.
[01:45:59.775 --> 01:46:10.922]  He's better than Mitt Romney, who is in the dressing room all made up right now in the bullpen, looking for a way to get in and praying that the party bosses call him at the 11th hour.
[01:46:10.962 --> 01:46:13.684]  Sure, I want to play a clip though, and then I want to talk about
[01:46:14.544 --> 01:46:15.445]  Some of those issues.
[01:46:15.906 --> 01:46:24.594]  The dirty trickster, the real dirty trickster, Rick Taylor, who got kicked off the campaign for the stuff he was playing, is still on the campaign, obviously.
[01:46:25.135 --> 01:46:30.680]  He's gone on these programs, CNN, MSNBC, you name it, and basically called for your arrest, called for your indictment.
[01:46:31.241 --> 01:46:36.566]  So I want new listeners to know, Mr. Stone wasn't just saying that a moment ago, this is really going on.
[01:46:36.606 --> 01:46:37.587]  Let's play a part of that clip.
[01:46:38.484 --> 01:47:00.938]  What concerns me is Paul Manafort, of course, was a business partner with Roger Stone, and Roger Stone just threatened delegates attending the convention in Cleveland, saying that he would publicize delegates' hotel rooms and hotel room numbers if they felt, if the Trump campaign felt like they were part of stealing delegates from Donald Trump.
[01:47:01.398 --> 01:47:07.342]  Now, he'd said that after he called on Trump supporters to come to Cleveland and somehow protest
[01:47:08.223 --> 01:47:10.905]  Uh, the process if Donald Trump were denied the nomination.
[01:47:11.526 --> 01:47:12.707]  I think that is dangerous.
[01:47:13.108 --> 01:47:14.649]  We are a free society in America.
[01:47:14.669 --> 01:47:15.890]  We're not a third world country.
[01:47:16.211 --> 01:47:18.013]  We don't threaten violence against delegates.
[01:47:18.033 --> 01:47:27.362]  And I think that Reince Priebus and the RNC should move to ban Roger Stone from the convention because we cannot tolerate threats and threats of violence in the process.
[01:47:27.742 --> 01:47:30.245]  Additionally, Donald Trump should repudiate those events, his remarks.
[01:47:32.108 --> 01:47:40.306]  And then he goes on in other statements to say again, there should be a criminal investigation for intimidation, all the rest of it, and that's in the Washington Post as well.
[01:47:41.167 --> 01:47:48.729]  Notice he says it's like a third world country that you'd want to protest to not have the elections cancelled, or the delegates taken, or the popular vote taken.
[01:47:48.990 --> 01:47:50.970]  The third world thing is what Cruz is doing.
[01:47:52.231 --> 01:48:06.375]  I played it last hour because of time, I'm not going to play it, but did you see all the clips of Cruz, Roger, running around saying he won the Democratic vote in Colorado and that you won't talk about it and Trump won't and Drudge is lying and won't show that he won?
[01:48:06.735 --> 01:48:08.656]  I mean, that is a total inversion of reality.
[01:48:09.315 --> 01:48:13.877]  Yeah, there's only one thing that Weiler guy was right about when he said we're a free society.
[01:48:13.897 --> 01:48:16.118]  And therefore, we have the right to peaceful protest.
[01:48:16.718 --> 01:48:18.759]  We have the right to mass in Cleveland.
[01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:23.061]  We have the right to find individual delegates and ask them to take the pledge.
[01:48:23.882 --> 01:48:27.343]  That if you are elected as a Trump delegate, you'll stick with Trump on every ballot.
[01:48:27.764 --> 01:48:30.005]  And you'll stick with Trump on all important questions.
[01:48:30.885 --> 01:48:33.706]  This is how they intend to hijack this nomination.
[01:48:34.207 --> 01:48:38.409]  So it is the foaming of the mouth of the establishment, not us.
[01:48:39.269 --> 01:48:43.872]  We have said from the beginning that our protest will be peaceful.
[01:48:44.793 --> 01:49:00.183]  Meanwhile, as you know, over at the Trump ballot security project, we continue to collect affidavits from voters in states like Texas and Kansas and Oklahoma and Utah particularly.
[01:49:00.523 --> 01:49:08.869]  We're prepared to collect affidavits in California or Pennsylvania that prove an inordinate number of irregularities
[01:49:09.809 --> 01:49:11.550]  And the pattern of fraud.
[01:49:11.650 --> 01:49:24.452]  Now, the Trump forces may or may not, or any individual Trump delegate may or may not choose to challenge the seating of those delegates based on election fraud.
[01:49:24.912 --> 01:49:32.294]  This is historically, precisely what the Eisenhower people did to Senator Robert Taft in 1952.
[01:49:32.714 --> 01:49:34.655]  Taft arrived in Chicago with 1,237 votes.
[01:49:36.755 --> 01:49:45.758]  The Texas and Louisiana delegates were unseated based on a case that Eisenhower supporters had not been allowed to vote in the caucuses.
[01:49:46.678 --> 01:49:54.281]  A case that doesn't need to be proven in a court of law because the Republican convention is governed by its own rules and bodies.
[01:49:54.801 --> 01:49:58.185]  So this is a potential real problem for the Cruz campaign.
[01:49:58.685 --> 01:50:09.978]  And if you want to support this important work, you can go to the new website for the Trump security, ballot security project, which these guys can supply for you.
[01:50:10.498 --> 01:50:14.243]  We're going to break and I want to come back and take a few calls, but you sent me a text this morning.
[01:50:14.263 --> 01:50:16.846]  You were really upset about the Phyllis Schlafly Eagle Forum founder.
[01:50:18.428 --> 01:50:25.937]  The cruise people, I guess they're operatives in Eagle Forum, tried to take it over and she said that she was told because she supports Trump.
[01:50:25.977 --> 01:50:29.141]  I mean, this is unprecedented activity of basically espionage.
[01:50:30.148 --> 01:50:31.209]  Well, it's worse than that.
[01:50:31.229 --> 01:50:38.575]  It is the mugging of a 90-year-old woman, a conservative icon, somebody there at the birth of the conservative movement.
[01:50:39.235 --> 01:50:49.944]  It's a hijacking by a gang of goons, and as will be proven very shortly, this plot to get Phyllis reaches all the way to the top levels.
[01:50:50.635 --> 01:50:56.478]  It was George Berkeley that famously said, if a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it make a sound, did it make a sound?
[01:51:19.636 --> 01:51:22.097]  Well, I'm here to give you the answer to that age-old question.
[01:51:22.277 --> 01:51:23.097]  Yes, it did.
[01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:37.664]  And if the American Republic had fallen, and no one in the mainstream media told you, would the Republic still be dead?
[01:51:38.344 --> 01:51:39.164]  And the answer is yes.
[01:51:42.966 --> 01:51:47.368]  In 20-plus years on air, I've never seen a demarcation line that clearly shows to me
[01:51:48.453 --> 01:51:58.820]  The full collapse has basically already gone to a point where you can say this country is unrecognizable and we are rapidly accelerating into a nightmare totalitarian system.
[01:51:59.981 --> 01:52:09.388]  We've seen Priebus, the head of the Republican Party, we've seen the head of the Rules Committee, Curly Hewlin or whatever his name is, come out and openly say, listen,
[01:52:11.192 --> 01:52:11.953]  The media's wrong.
[01:52:11.973 --> 01:52:12.994]  You never had a vote.
[01:52:13.134 --> 01:52:13.834]  It doesn't count.
[01:52:13.854 --> 01:52:15.116]  The party picks whoever's there.
[01:52:15.476 --> 01:52:17.077]  You're just here at a fashion contest.
[01:52:17.418 --> 01:52:20.080]  Political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[01:52:21.041 --> 01:52:22.482]  Contrary to popular belief.
[01:52:22.942 --> 01:52:24.444]  Then why am I holding the primaries?
[01:52:25.441 --> 01:52:26.562]  That's a very good question.
[01:52:26.782 --> 01:52:41.672]  Then when myself and Roger Stone and others came out and simply called for people to go protest and demonstrate and talk to the delegates, and we said it, don't be violent, in Cleveland coming up in a few months, they had all their pundits go on TV and say, maybe Roger Stone should be arrested.
[01:52:41.812 --> 01:52:45.875]  This is in a climate with all these incredible attacks on free speech, and it's really creepy.
[01:52:46.255 --> 01:52:47.777]  We are a free society in America.
[01:52:47.797 --> 01:52:48.998]  We're not a third world country.
[01:52:49.298 --> 01:52:51.060]  We don't threaten violence against delegates.
[01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:59.067]  And I think that Reince Priebus and the RNC should move to ban Roger Stone from the convention because we cannot tolerate threats and threats of violence.
[01:52:59.467 --> 01:53:02.650]  They're also stealing states and delegates from Bernie Sanders.
[01:53:02.990 --> 01:53:06.294]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're telling you that they're allowed to make these rules.
[01:53:06.854 --> 01:53:09.956]  But they're taking public taxpayer money by the billions.
[01:53:10.316 --> 01:53:15.080]  And the counties and cities are holding out that we're having public elections where it's one person, one vote.
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:22.785]  There are federal and state election laws, like the 1965 Voting Rights Act, that's meant to block this type of racketeering.
[01:53:23.546 --> 01:53:29.790]  Even Jim Crow laws against poor blacks and whites were not this strict or this over the top.
[01:53:30.230 --> 01:53:32.151]  And I'll close with the words of President JFK.
[01:53:33.012 --> 01:53:38.135]  Those that make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.
[01:53:38.856 --> 01:53:44.800]  And the power brokers know that and they want to break our will and push forward and want a civil war in this country.
[01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:46.421]  Let's peacefully go out.
[01:53:46.941 --> 01:53:48.002]  Let's sue these people.
[01:53:48.602 --> 01:53:50.163]  Let's donate to political causes.
[01:53:50.203 --> 01:53:51.144]  Let's get involved.
[01:53:51.584 --> 01:53:53.145]  Let's have our minds heard.
[01:53:53.526 --> 01:53:55.307]  Let's expose these political party machines.
[01:53:55.347 --> 01:53:58.269]  Let's do everything we can to stop this illegal
[01:53:58.729 --> 01:54:00.191]  It's a big club and you ain't in it.
[01:54:18.906 --> 01:54:26.953]  Eight after next hour, we've got the geopolitical analyst expert on global banking and on politics, Dr. Jerome Corsi, joining us for the Balance of the Hour.
[01:54:26.973 --> 01:54:28.694]  I've got loaded phone lines here.
[01:54:28.954 --> 01:54:32.037]  Speaking of Jerome, I've got a Jerome from New York, Allie in Illinois.
[01:54:33.228 --> 01:54:33.789]  Chad in Michigan.
[01:54:33.809 --> 01:54:34.389]  I want to go to everybody.
[01:54:34.409 --> 01:54:37.693]  We've got five minutes now, six minutes, and then five minutes to the next hour.
[01:54:37.753 --> 01:54:38.754]  Mr. Stone's got to go.
[01:54:38.774 --> 01:54:39.735]  Stonezone.com.
[01:54:40.035 --> 01:54:40.776]  Get both his books.
[01:54:40.816 --> 01:54:46.341]  Again, InfoWarsStore.com and support his work and my work at the same time because we're all in this together.
[01:54:47.182 --> 01:54:50.145]  There's another story about Wayne Madsen up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:54:50.486 --> 01:54:53.108]  Karl Rove backing Cruz and Clinton at the same time.
[01:54:53.749 --> 01:54:56.591]  I mean, the Republicans and Democrats are merging in front of everyone.
[01:54:56.992 --> 01:54:57.852]  This is crazy.
[01:54:57.872 --> 01:54:59.654]  Another article on InfoWars.com.
[01:55:00.074 --> 01:55:03.117]  University bans golf team from using Trump course.
[01:55:03.437 --> 01:55:04.678]  Cites social justice.
[01:55:05.278 --> 01:55:09.282]  Catholic University has banned its teams from ever playing on the courses.
[01:55:09.322 --> 01:55:11.684]  I mean, this is economic warfare, folks.
[01:55:12.064 --> 01:55:17.308]  This is all these foreign interest in groups from the Communist Chinese and the Pope attacking our election process.
[01:55:17.368 --> 01:55:18.349]  This is globalism.
[01:55:18.790 --> 01:55:21.232]  America ganged up on being taken over by traitors.
[01:55:22.256 --> 01:55:26.059]  And I just gotta tell you, Cruz is now right up there with Hillary Clinton as an enemy of the Republic.
[01:55:26.259 --> 01:55:27.119]  I'm sorry, I'll just say it.
[01:55:27.399 --> 01:55:28.100]  I don't like doing that.
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:31.822]  I know I got a lot of listeners that are into Cruz, not many, but some, and it's sick.
[01:55:32.563 --> 01:55:37.046]  Getting back to Roger Stone, please flesh that out for a minute or two, then we're going to call, sir.
[01:55:37.586 --> 01:55:39.147]  I got Dr. Corsi on Skype.
[01:55:39.187 --> 01:55:40.647]  He's going, hey, that's my headline for tomorrow.
[01:55:40.667 --> 01:55:41.148]  That's big.
[01:55:41.548 --> 01:55:42.608]  Yeah, we're all over this.
[01:55:42.768 --> 01:55:55.914]  This is the type of thing that can capture the public's understanding of Cruz, that if he's behind his campaign, a takeover of bank accounts and a patriot organization, Phyllis Schlafly, from within, that if it's being investigated, I think could be criminal.
[01:55:55.934 --> 01:55:56.894]  She defeated the coup.
[01:55:57.654 --> 01:55:58.775]  Wow, this is amazing.
[01:55:58.815 --> 01:56:00.395]  Roger Stone, tell us the intel.
[01:56:00.415 --> 01:56:03.457]  I know you can't tell us specifics yet because you're working on that.
[01:56:03.477 --> 01:56:05.858]  I mean, you have the facts, but this is going to be a big story.
[01:56:05.898 --> 01:56:06.418]  Tell us what you know.
[01:56:07.128 --> 01:56:08.649]  Well, I'm just, I want to leave it at this.
[01:56:08.709 --> 01:56:13.031]  This reaches all the way to the top of the Ted Cruz campaign, and it's not surprising.
[01:56:13.492 --> 01:56:16.193]  We've seen these tactics from the Cruz bots before.
[01:56:16.714 --> 01:56:33.143]  Who can forget the way they planted a story on CNN that Dr. Ben Carson was getting out of the race, and then they contacted a pre-identified list of Carson voters, thousands of them, and told them, CNN just reported Ben Carson's getting out.
[01:56:33.623 --> 01:56:34.644]  Don't throw away your vote.
[01:56:34.684 --> 01:56:35.665]  Vote for Ted Cruz.
[01:56:36.365 --> 01:56:39.447]  Now, when they got caught, Ted Cruz reminded me of Dick Dixon.
[01:56:39.487 --> 01:56:42.668]  He was out there saying, well, I knew nothing about this.
[01:56:42.788 --> 01:56:44.689]  No, he knew everything about it.
[01:56:45.670 --> 01:56:52.513]  And the robo calls into South Carolina saying Donald Trump supports the gay and lesbian agenda.
[01:56:53.093 --> 01:57:01.717]  And the robocalls into South Carolina telling pro-life voters that Donald Trump and his wife supported abortion on demand.
[01:57:01.818 --> 01:57:08.141]  So, he complains about dirty tricks, he whines about dirty tricks, but he's the master of dirty tricks.
[01:57:08.161 --> 01:57:10.362]  This is why I call him Tricky Ted.
[01:57:11.242 --> 01:57:12.843]  He's not what he says he is, folks.
[01:57:12.903 --> 01:57:18.906]  He is a Bush family retainer, largely responsible for the election of George Bush.
[01:57:18.946 --> 01:57:22.687]  He wrote the legal arguments for Bush v. Gore.
[01:57:23.268 --> 01:57:30.471]  He recruited John Roberts to that legal team and pushed him for the Supreme Court where he approved Obamacare.
[01:57:30.811 --> 01:57:32.652]  That's the real Ted Cruz.
[01:57:33.072 --> 01:57:35.693]  Alright, let's go to a call before we go to break.
[01:57:35.953 --> 01:57:36.874]  Al in Illinois.
[01:57:38.553 --> 01:57:41.415]  This is Colorado Delegate Vote Fraud Committee.
[01:57:42.015 --> 01:57:42.636]  Al, you're on the air.
[01:57:42.676 --> 01:57:44.097]  Quick question or comment for Roger Stone.
[01:57:45.918 --> 01:57:46.658]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:57:47.379 --> 01:57:59.626]  Roger Stone, I just wanted to know, because of this Colorado incident where they set it up so it's rigged with no voters allowed, how many more states are coming up?
[01:57:59.706 --> 01:58:07.030]  And then I also have a YouTube video that most people have not caught on to, but it does have a ton of YouTube videos.
[01:58:07.962 --> 01:58:14.744]  Uh, the name of the YouTube video, if you want to search it on YouTube, is Colorado Trump Delegate Removed and Replaced.
[01:58:15.424 --> 01:58:27.228]  And he basically goes on record, he does a Facebook mentions in his video, or YouTube video, I'm not really sure how he did it, but he's basically saying that he waited in line for hours to vote for Donald Trump.
[01:58:27.819 --> 01:58:28.240]  Yes, yes.
[01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:29.141]  I've seen the video.
[01:58:29.181 --> 01:58:30.283]  We should do a story on it.
[01:58:30.343 --> 01:58:31.665]  They've had thousands of these calls.
[01:58:31.886 --> 01:58:34.590]  They take the real delegates, replace them with operatives.
[01:58:35.031 --> 01:58:35.973]  Powerful info.
[01:58:36.513 --> 01:58:37.735]  Roger, that's what you're talking about.
[01:58:37.776 --> 01:58:38.397]  This is crazy.
[01:58:40.583 --> 01:58:46.449]  Yeah, this is part and parcel of the kind of Gestapo tactics that Paul Manafort spoke about on Meet the Press.
[01:58:46.769 --> 01:58:49.772]  What they're doing to Phyllis Schlafly, another example.
[01:58:50.673 --> 01:58:51.313]  It's incredible.
[01:58:51.333 --> 01:58:51.814]  Stay there.
[01:58:51.994 --> 01:58:53.415]  I mean, imagine what he'd do as president.
[01:58:53.455 --> 01:58:54.496]  This is unbelievable.
[01:58:54.516 --> 01:58:55.757]  70 seconds, we're back.
[01:58:55.797 --> 01:58:56.598]  Take a few more calls.
[01:58:56.738 --> 01:58:57.679]  Thank you, Allen, Illinois.
[01:58:58.100 --> 01:58:58.920]  I'm Alex Jones, folks.
[01:58:58.940 --> 01:58:59.381]  Spread the word.
[01:59:00.882 --> 01:59:04.205]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[01:59:04.345 --> 01:59:06.607]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[01:59:06.787 --> 01:59:15.173]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:59:15.434 --> 01:59:21.078]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it after consulting top doctors, nutritionists,
[01:59:21.118 --> 01:59:36.843]  Pharmacist and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:59:37.043 --> 01:59:38.944]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:59:39.284 --> 01:59:46.846]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:59:47.226 --> 01:59:53.414]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[02:00:02.625 --> 02:00:05.229]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:12.335 --> 02:00:15.101]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:00:15.663 --> 02:00:18.950]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:33.931 --> 02:00:36.631]  Man, I tell you, it is such an epic time to be alive.
[02:00:36.671 --> 02:00:37.652]  It is so incredible.
[02:00:38.052 --> 02:00:40.792]  And I knew I was right to get behind Trump like eight months ago.
[02:00:41.532 --> 02:00:43.433]  But now, I mean, I'm sure he's the guy.
[02:00:43.893 --> 02:00:44.813]  Absolutely sure.
[02:00:44.933 --> 02:00:46.313]  Wow.
[02:00:46.393 --> 02:00:49.374]  Boy, the system is shooting its wad trying to block him.
[02:00:49.814 --> 02:00:52.294]  So any way you cut it, as long as we're politically involved, this is a win.
[02:00:52.354 --> 02:00:53.174]  Roger Stones with us.
[02:00:53.194 --> 02:00:53.794]  Five more minutes.
[02:00:54.114 --> 02:00:54.995]  We're taking phone calls.
[02:00:55.355 --> 02:00:56.935]  Crystal in North Carolina.
[02:00:57.235 --> 02:00:58.635]  You're on the air with Roger Stone.
[02:00:58.775 --> 02:00:59.115]  Go ahead.
[02:01:00.395 --> 02:01:00.916]  Hey, Roger.
[02:01:00.956 --> 02:01:01.436]  Hey, Alex.
[02:01:01.616 --> 02:01:03.156]  I had a question for you guys.
[02:01:04.936 --> 02:01:10.199]  What about these supporters who cannot make it out to the convention?
[02:01:10.279 --> 02:01:14.601]  What can we do here at home to help support you guys out in the field?
[02:01:14.621 --> 02:01:15.901]  Tell everybody else to go there.
[02:01:16.042 --> 02:01:16.742]  Donate money.
[02:01:17.462 --> 02:01:18.183]  Be involved.
[02:01:18.243 --> 02:01:19.343]  Call and talk radio.
[02:01:19.403 --> 02:01:20.664]  Send out our news articles.
[02:01:20.964 --> 02:01:22.665]  Just get aggressive because you're being robbed.
[02:01:22.685 --> 02:01:23.405]  You're being attacked.
[02:01:23.645 --> 02:01:25.006]  It's like a mugger's attacking you.
[02:01:25.026 --> 02:01:28.387]  You've got to get pissed and just engage and run their butt over.
[02:01:28.427 --> 02:01:28.827]  I'm sorry.
[02:01:29.048 --> 02:01:29.588]  Roger, go ahead.
[02:01:30.328 --> 02:01:33.750]  Look, if you can't make it to Cleveland, that's fine.
[02:01:34.251 --> 02:01:38.974]  Send us $10, send us $25, $35, $50, whatever you can afford.
[02:01:39.594 --> 02:01:46.719]  I want to run buses, air-conditioned buses, from major centers across the country, certainly across the Midwest.
[02:01:47.060 --> 02:01:49.761]  The more money we raise, the more buses we can get.
[02:01:50.222 --> 02:01:51.683]  People need some place to bunk.
[02:01:51.723 --> 02:01:53.464]  We're looking for low-cost housing.
[02:01:53.564 --> 02:01:54.445]  This is a war.
[02:01:54.505 --> 02:01:55.205]  This is a war.
[02:01:55.266 --> 02:01:56.026]  It costs money.
[02:01:56.106 --> 02:01:57.347]  Commit or lose everything.
[02:01:57.548 --> 02:02:00.250]  They're going to rob you of everything, folks, unless you commit.
[02:02:01.071 --> 02:02:05.755]  We want to buy internet ads telling people where they need to be.
[02:02:06.175 --> 02:02:11.000]  We want to build the largest outdoor rally in Cleveland history.
[02:02:11.020 --> 02:02:13.001]  And notice how scared the mainstream media is.
[02:02:13.302 --> 02:02:16.224]  They know there's millions of Trump supporters in that area.
[02:02:16.264 --> 02:02:16.905]  They are scared.
[02:02:18.314 --> 02:02:25.456]  The response from the local Trump supporters in Northeastern Ohio has been amazing, but I know people who are coming all the way from Florida.
[02:02:25.536 --> 02:02:27.536]  I know people who are coming all the way from Utah.
[02:02:27.976 --> 02:02:30.237]  This is going to be the place to be.
[02:02:30.957 --> 02:02:32.657]  We've invited Pat Buchanan to speak.
[02:02:33.317 --> 02:02:38.479]  We will invite Ron Paul at least to speak about the question of the tactics of the steal.
[02:02:38.519 --> 02:02:44.980]  He's not a Trump supporter, but he has been a victim of this same kind of establishment.
[02:02:45.140 --> 02:02:47.982]  I love Ron Paul, but he should speak out against the theft, because it happened to him.
[02:02:48.022 --> 02:02:48.902]  This is even bigger, though.
[02:02:49.242 --> 02:03:01.009]  And as you know, Trump has called for the audit of the Fed, which I think Libertarian voters need to recognize that, unfortunately, Ted Cruz missed that vote, because his puppet masters wouldn't let him vote for it.
[02:03:01.329 --> 02:03:03.230]  They like the Fed just as it is.
[02:03:04.610 --> 02:03:05.611]  Let's take another call.
[02:03:06.612 --> 02:03:09.373]  Let's go ahead and go to Eve in Texas.
[02:03:09.393 --> 02:03:10.033]  Eve, you're on the air.
[02:03:10.073 --> 02:03:10.714]  Real quick question.
[02:03:10.734 --> 02:03:10.994]  Thank you.
[02:03:12.369 --> 02:03:14.670]  Hello Alex and Roger, I have a question to both of you.
[02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:33.835]  If Donald Trump, and I am a Trump supporter, if Donald Trump is not the nominee and they decide to go with Ted Cruz, and if Ted Cruz wins the presidency, do you all think that they will choose Jeb Bush to run as VP and then we would have a short-term presidency?
[02:03:35.539 --> 02:03:47.421]  I think that Jeb gave a very interesting review to Politico just before he dropped out of the race, in which he mused that he could actually get nominated without winning a certain primary state.
[02:03:48.002 --> 02:03:50.522]  In other words, he blurted out the truth.
[02:03:51.262 --> 02:03:54.523]  This is why I'm asking people to read Jeb and the Bush crime family.
[02:03:54.923 --> 02:04:00.104]  Remember when Neil Bush was moved into a crucial position in Ted Cruz's campaign?
[02:04:00.584 --> 02:04:07.608]  Neil Bush being George W. Bush's brother, a man who's defrauding of an SNL costs U.S.
[02:04:07.648 --> 02:04:10.549]  taxpayers $1.5 billion.
[02:04:11.650 --> 02:04:17.193]  But because he's a child of privilege and a member of the Bush crime family, he spent not a day in jail.
[02:04:17.253 --> 02:04:17.433]  Sure.
[02:04:17.473 --> 02:04:20.354]  Well, also in closing, Roger, what about Paul Ryan?
[02:04:20.374 --> 02:04:22.075]  They admit he, you said, is getting ready to run.
[02:04:22.875 --> 02:04:24.096]  When he says he's not, it means he is.
[02:04:24.516 --> 02:04:26.597]  Meeting with donors, having secret meetings.
[02:04:26.998 --> 02:04:27.598]  He's suiting up.
[02:04:28.976 --> 02:04:30.877]  Yeah, I think that there's no question.
[02:04:31.357 --> 02:04:35.179]  He's going about this the same way he went about his campaign to be Speaker.
[02:04:35.239 --> 02:04:39.140]  By first acting like Caesar and saying, I don't want it, I'm not interested.
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:42.441]  Obviously, he would take it if it were available.
[02:04:43.182 --> 02:04:45.483]  Mitt Romney is irked that he didn't run.
[02:04:46.423 --> 02:04:52.769]  Remember, he didn't run this year because he was convinced that Jeb's nomination was inevitable.
[02:04:52.849 --> 02:04:54.071]  Roger, incredible info.
[02:04:54.111 --> 02:04:55.272]  Thanks for all the breaking news.
[02:04:55.792 --> 02:04:56.753]  Thanks for your courage.
[02:04:57.474 --> 02:04:59.856]  TrumpBallotSecurity.org, StopTheSteal.org.
[02:05:00.177 --> 02:05:01.097]  Please stay in contact.
[02:05:01.137 --> 02:05:02.599]  Thank you for your daily updates you send me.
[02:05:02.639 --> 02:05:03.300]  God bless you.
[02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:04.501]  He's talking to my riders.
[02:05:04.521 --> 02:05:05.842]  The guy's working so hard, folks.
[02:05:06.142 --> 02:05:07.003]  Thank you so much.
[02:05:07.023 --> 02:05:07.604]  You're a tiger.
[02:05:07.624 --> 02:05:08.465]  God bless you.
[02:05:08.485 --> 02:05:09.406]  We'll be back with Jerome Corsi.
[02:05:10.707 --> 02:05:19.734]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:05:19.814 --> 02:05:28.040]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:05:28.220 --> 02:05:32.884]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:05:33.084 --> 02:05:39.791]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:39.871 --> 02:05:46.958]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:05:47.038 --> 02:05:53.905]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:05:54.065 --> 02:05:58.427]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:05:58.547 --> 02:06:01.809]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:06:01.929 --> 02:06:08.091]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:06:08.231 --> 02:06:10.452]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:10.572 --> 02:06:11.593]  BrainForce is here.
[02:06:12.113 --> 02:06:14.394]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:06:14.674 --> 02:06:22.478]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:26.822]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[02:06:26.862 --> 02:06:29.203]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:06:29.564 --> 02:06:33.066]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:06:33.126 --> 02:06:36.267]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:06:36.768 --> 02:06:41.550]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:06:42.091 --> 02:06:43.932]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[02:06:44.292 --> 02:06:48.694]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:06:48.875 --> 02:06:50.876]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:06:51.496 --> 02:06:52.977]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:06:53.117 --> 02:06:53.357]  Exactly.
[02:06:53.377 --> 02:06:57.181]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:06:57.681 --> 02:07:05.668]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:07:10.413 --> 02:07:11.773]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:07:12.074 --> 02:07:13.354]  You can't survive without it.
[02:07:13.554 --> 02:07:14.454]  But where do you get it?
[02:07:14.754 --> 02:07:20.516]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:07:20.736 --> 02:07:26.458]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:07:26.658 --> 02:07:43.526]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[02:07:43.906 --> 02:07:46.048]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[02:07:46.408 --> 02:07:47.589]  Stainless steel construction.
[02:07:47.869 --> 02:07:48.570]  Easy assembly.
[02:07:48.910 --> 02:07:49.531]  Low maintenance.
[02:07:49.831 --> 02:07:51.653]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[02:08:04.403 --> 02:08:06.965]  Go to InfowarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:08:20.740 --> 02:08:22.902]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:08:23.302 --> 02:08:25.864]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:08:26.425 --> 02:08:28.767]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:33.431 --> 02:08:34.311]  Well, I gotta say it.
[02:08:34.471 --> 02:08:41.918]  I ignored the Bush pedigree, the TPP connections, the CFR connections, the Goldman Sachs connections.
[02:08:42.578 --> 02:08:45.961]  Because I know people that have come out of Goldman Sachs, like Nomi Prims, that exposed it.
[02:08:45.981 --> 02:08:49.524]  I know people that have been in the CFR, like Steve Pucinich, who resigned from it.
[02:08:50.865 --> 02:08:54.126]  I mean, just because you've been in the establishment doesn't mean you're bad overall.
[02:08:55.467 --> 02:09:06.312]  But Ted Cruz, who I really liked in the Senate and the work he did, I think he's a very eloquent, smart guy, he's flipped a switch the last few months where, I mean, it's like Bill Clinton's up there on steroids.
[02:09:07.152 --> 02:09:08.513]  He's worse than Obama or Hillary.
[02:09:08.553 --> 02:09:20.138]  I mean, he goes, I played the clips in the first hour, he said, it's a democracy, I won the vote in Colorado, and Matt Drudge is a
[02:09:23.434 --> 02:09:26.777]  Operative, is the quote, of Trump against his orders from Roger Stone.
[02:09:28.858 --> 02:09:31.100]  Well, I have to know for a fact Stone and him aren't even talking.
[02:09:31.841 --> 02:09:38.506]  I mean, it's a story when the Republicans start cancelling state elections and just have the superdelegates ignore the delegates.
[02:09:38.546 --> 02:09:41.989]  The delegates are coming out saying they were for Trump and they were just switched out.
[02:09:42.049 --> 02:09:42.869]  Then they got a vote of that.
[02:09:43.370 --> 02:09:45.051]  This is the suspension of our election.
[02:09:47.113 --> 02:09:51.196]  And they're doing it to Bernie Sanders too, but Trump's way ahead of Sanders.
[02:09:53.621 --> 02:09:58.304]  In his lead, his lead's much bigger over Cruz than Sanders over Hillary, but they're stealing it there too.
[02:09:58.744 --> 02:10:03.426]  Both parties are openly merging against the populist movement.
[02:10:04.827 --> 02:10:08.549]  And then I played the clip of Cruz on the radio going, yeah, it's crazy.
[02:10:08.609 --> 02:10:14.772]  Drudge just does all this horrible stuff and when I win states like Colorado, he won't even report that I won the votes?
[02:10:17.214 --> 02:10:22.557]  And Drudge reported that there weren't votes and said no election, no voters needed.
[02:10:23.539 --> 02:10:25.640]  So we've hit a new level.
[02:10:27.661 --> 02:10:29.102]  Obama says 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[02:10:29.482 --> 02:10:30.723]  He says you didn't build your business.
[02:10:30.783 --> 02:10:32.704]  I mean, I thought that was the top.
[02:10:33.424 --> 02:10:35.806]  That Obamacare is free and then you can keep your doctor.
[02:10:36.186 --> 02:10:37.847]  I thought it couldn't go any further.
[02:10:38.427 --> 02:10:45.431]  And Ted Cruz is like unclothed and it's weird when you've liked somebody before because I never liked Bill Clinton or Hillary.
[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:48.761]  I always disliked him, so now I'm just reviled with him.
[02:10:49.241 --> 02:10:51.521]  But it's weird that I actually hoped Ted Cruz was real.
[02:10:51.782 --> 02:10:54.482]  We interviewed him when he was running for Senate in Texas.
[02:10:55.322 --> 02:10:57.803]  Didn't mind he was, you know, a guy from Canada or whatever.
[02:10:57.823 --> 02:10:58.863]  At least he claimed he was conservative.
[02:10:59.123 --> 02:11:00.464]  I tried to ignore the Bush connections.
[02:11:02.764 --> 02:11:04.745]  And man, I feel like I got chumped.
[02:11:05.825 --> 02:11:07.686]  And it's a weird, creepy feeling now.
[02:11:07.726 --> 02:11:09.306]  I'm, like, scared of Ted Cruz.
[02:11:09.986 --> 02:11:11.407]  Not like, oh, I'm afraid he's gonna get me.
[02:11:11.447 --> 02:11:12.647]  I'm, like, scared for the country.
[02:11:12.747 --> 02:11:14.388]  I feel really betrayed.
[02:11:14.408 --> 02:11:15.488]  I feel really dirty.
[02:11:16.820 --> 02:11:17.841]  I feel like a failure.
[02:11:18.862 --> 02:11:22.845]  I've never felt like this because I've never supported somebody that turned out to be pure evil.
[02:11:23.585 --> 02:11:25.387]  I've seen folks make mistakes for not being perfect.
[02:11:25.727 --> 02:11:26.908]  I'm completely freaked out right now.
[02:11:27.709 --> 02:11:36.856]  And we got open world government being announced, the socialist communist pope telling us what to do, Catholic churches saying, you know, and schools saying you can't be on Trump golf courses.
[02:11:38.397 --> 02:11:45.143]  Drudge being demonized, Phyllis Schlafly, he broke it, it's now all over mainstream news, WorldNetDaily, WND.com, Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[02:11:47.489 --> 02:11:48.349]  Broke the news.
[02:11:48.990 --> 02:11:51.590]  Phyllis Schlafly, my board, plotted to fire me over Trump.
[02:11:51.831 --> 02:11:53.611]  Tried to take the bank accounts.
[02:11:53.971 --> 02:11:57.433]  Tried to vote with a coup d'etat, even though the rules, the corporation said they couldn't.
[02:11:59.513 --> 02:12:00.194]  And she stopped them.
[02:12:00.234 --> 02:12:00.934]  The bank stopped them.
[02:12:00.974 --> 02:12:02.414]  And they said, no, this is improper.
[02:12:02.795 --> 02:12:03.835]  And now you heard Stone.
[02:12:03.895 --> 02:12:04.935]  And Stone wouldn't say this.
[02:12:05.375 --> 02:12:08.697]  Everything that guy said has turned out to be accurate.
[02:12:09.997 --> 02:12:12.118]  Man, I read him 10 years ago on JFK book he was writing.
[02:12:12.138 --> 02:12:14.559]  Didn't realize how big a politico he was, but I knew he had been.
[02:12:15.458 --> 02:12:17.840]  But I tell you, he says it's coming out soon.
[02:12:18.781 --> 02:12:20.883]  He told us a little bit more, but I'm not allowed to talk about it.
[02:12:21.904 --> 02:12:37.738]  That specifically, this is from the campaign that they were running, the attempt to take over the oldest true conservative organization in America that is the proto-progenitor of the libertarian Tea Party Republican movement that both the Democrat and Republican establishment hate.
[02:12:39.554 --> 02:12:47.017]  Now, we've got Dr. Jerome Corsi, who is really known for banking and business and hostage negotiations.
[02:12:48.657 --> 02:12:58.280]  He's also better known by the public, but that's what he really does, for what, two, three, four, number one New York Times best-selling books that have game-changed two elections at least.
[02:12:59.921 --> 02:13:08.064]  And he joins us until 45 after them and hit other news, and then we've got a guest host coming on to host things, David Knight, in the fourth hour today.
[02:13:09.141 --> 02:13:20.053]  Jerome Corsi, WND.com, Twitter.com forward slash Jerome underscore Corsi, PhD from Harvard University, Political Science 72, currently Senior Staff Reporter, WorldNetDaily.com, where he works as an investigative reporter.
[02:13:20.073 --> 02:13:22.957]  He's also an expert on political violence and terrorism and jihadist.
[02:13:23.497 --> 02:13:26.461]  In 1981, he received a top secret clearance from the Agency for International Development
[02:13:26.761 --> 02:13:30.744]  Where he assisted in providing anti-terrorism training to embassy personnel.
[02:13:30.945 --> 02:13:34.548]  25 years beginning in 81, of course, he developed and worked with banks throughout the United States and around the world.
[02:13:34.568 --> 02:13:43.075]  Developed financial services marketing companies to assist banks in establishing broker dealers and insurance subsidiaries to provide financial planning products and services to their retail customers.
[02:13:43.095 --> 02:13:44.936]  That's why he knows Donald Trump for 40 plus years.
[02:13:45.377 --> 02:13:47.138]  He is a noted financial services speaker.
[02:13:47.358 --> 02:13:49.901]  That's where he's the big rock star, folks, is banking and what's happening.
[02:13:50.321 --> 02:13:54.544]  Published three books and numerous articles in professional financial services journals and magazines.
[02:13:55.365 --> 02:14:01.150]  And he's the guy that last time connected the dots where all these other insiders had told me years ago, no, Trump's a patriot.
[02:14:01.170 --> 02:14:01.871]  He knows what's going on.
[02:14:02.171 --> 02:14:02.991]  He's a nationalist.
[02:14:03.011 --> 02:14:04.973]  What do you think of Donald Trump?
[02:14:05.033 --> 02:14:07.095]  And I'm just like, Donald Trump, you know, the real estate guy?
[02:14:07.575 --> 02:14:10.798]  And he told us last time, no, Trump knows as much as we do or more, Alex.
[02:14:10.818 --> 02:14:12.299]  He's a patriot, a nationalist.
[02:14:12.319 --> 02:14:12.940]  It's why they hate him.
[02:14:13.460 --> 02:14:14.201]  And clearly they do.
[02:14:14.241 --> 02:14:16.703]  This isn't some shell op to make us think they hate him.
[02:14:16.743 --> 02:14:17.383]  So we go for him.
[02:14:17.623 --> 02:14:19.025]  They're stealing it openly.
[02:14:19.850 --> 02:14:24.073]  So, do we start with Shaftley, Philip Schlafly, Eagle Forum?
[02:14:24.093 --> 02:14:25.614]  Do we start with the Big Steel?
[02:14:26.395 --> 02:14:29.777]  Do we start with the IMF admitting the world's going into a depression?
[02:14:29.797 --> 02:14:32.439]  I mean, there's so many time bombs here.
[02:14:32.479 --> 02:14:33.420]  The Russians pulled out.
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:35.861]  Saudi Arabia and the Jihadis attacked again.
[02:14:35.881 --> 02:14:40.725]  Now the Russians have had to go back in because Aleppo has got 100,000 ISIS people attacking it.
[02:14:41.650 --> 02:14:44.373]  I mean, the world is teetering on the edge in my view.
[02:14:44.733 --> 02:14:47.436]  Dr. Corsi, what do you want to tackle first?
[02:14:47.516 --> 02:14:49.137]  I mean, there's just so much.
[02:14:49.197 --> 02:14:55.363]  Am I right in saying that we've probably never been in a point in modern times more dangerous on so many fronts?
[02:14:55.383 --> 02:14:57.165]  I mean, what would you call the state of the world right now?
[02:14:57.766 --> 02:14:59.828]  Oh, I agree with you entirely, Alex.
[02:14:59.868 --> 02:15:04.792]  I mean, this is a precarious state entirely, not just in politics, but in economics.
[02:15:06.239 --> 02:15:21.351]  The world is closer, I think, to a combination of a new depression, which will make the last depression in the 30s look like a picnic, and a new world war, which will make the last world war look like a picnic.
[02:15:22.076 --> 02:15:24.858]  I mean, we're at the collapse of the financial systems.
[02:15:24.918 --> 02:15:28.460]  This mountain of debt on social welfare cannot sustain.
[02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:29.800]  It's going to collapse.
[02:15:29.860 --> 02:15:31.121]  It's starting to collapse in Europe.
[02:15:31.741 --> 02:15:34.743]  European banks are going to negative interest rates.
[02:15:34.843 --> 02:15:38.445]  The European Union is stretched beyond being efficient.
[02:15:38.985 --> 02:15:41.627]  The European Union is breaking apart with refugees.
[02:15:42.768 --> 02:15:48.311]  It's a complete shambles in terms of the dream of a united Europe.
[02:15:49.491 --> 02:15:54.435]  I think in the Middle East we're closer to war, nuclear war, than we've ever been.
[02:15:54.455 --> 02:16:03.361]  I now envision nuclear war, including in the next 20 years within the Middle East, starting a regional nuclear war.
[02:16:03.381 --> 02:16:07.283]  I think Iran is pushing towards a nuclear weapon.
[02:16:07.323 --> 02:16:17.110]  I would not be surprised to see Israel calculating a preemptive attack on Iran, perhaps even before the election.
[02:16:17.850 --> 02:16:30.742]  I mean, this is, I think, the most critical time in world history, and we're on the verge of a major financial collapse and a World War III event, and the globalists would be happy.
[02:16:30.822 --> 02:16:33.325]  I mean, you know, kill five, six billion people.
[02:16:33.345 --> 02:16:34.346]  They're not going to miss them.
[02:16:34.386 --> 02:16:35.266]  That's the problem.
[02:16:35.367 --> 02:16:38.970]  I've been interviewing you for probably 14 years, and you've never talked.
[02:16:39.450 --> 02:16:40.410]  Like this, this grave.
[02:16:40.470 --> 02:16:44.012]  And other, even mainline analysts are saying, hit the panic button.
[02:16:44.432 --> 02:16:54.115]  And then the politicians, not just here, but all over the Western world, act like they don't care, bring in five million, mainly jihadis, put sleeper cells in, fly them in and don't check their IDs.
[02:16:54.155 --> 02:16:56.315]  Donald Trump says we should stop this till we check them.
[02:16:56.776 --> 02:16:58.116]  There's a war on common sense.
[02:16:58.516 --> 02:16:59.296]  What's happening?
[02:16:59.316 --> 02:17:00.737]  Because I always thought the leftist
[02:17:01.457 --> 02:17:09.864]  We're run by big, you know, combines, which they are, and that they didn't believe their ideology, that it was just a way to hamstring young people and turn them into jellyfish and dependents.
[02:17:09.904 --> 02:17:14.707]  But now, I go back to what you would say 14 years ago, or others, no, Alex, they really believe it.
[02:17:14.767 --> 02:17:18.570]  They really want to take over and screw everything up to build their utopia.
[02:17:19.291 --> 02:17:29.079]  And so, now I realize we really have power-mad pseudo-communists run by weirdo war criminals like George Soros going completely insane
[02:17:30.453 --> 02:17:31.755]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:17:31.895 --> 02:17:33.837]  I don't think they even know what they're doing now.
[02:17:33.877 --> 02:17:41.065]  They just hate freedom, hate free market, hate Christians, hate America, and just want to screw everything up.
[02:17:41.105 --> 02:17:41.905]  I mean, what do we do?
[02:17:42.878 --> 02:17:56.536]  Well, I mean, for the left and the right, I think we're right back to where we were in the 1930s, that the communists want to have state control, they want to have state control of all private property, but they want a social welfare system.
[02:17:57.057 --> 02:17:59.840]  They want a totalitarian government.
[02:18:00.701 --> 02:18:12.508]  I've said from the beginning that the Nazis, which in a sense I think we've adopted the fascist ideology, we've become state-controlled business, but also with a strong social welfare system.
[02:18:13.248 --> 02:18:18.111]  You make a mistake to think that the left and the right don't agree on government spending.
[02:18:18.871 --> 02:18:23.874]  Paul Ryan would be happy to spend the United States in oblivion.
[02:18:23.914 --> 02:18:26.816]  He's not going to stop spending on social welfare.
[02:18:26.836 --> 02:18:28.137]  He doesn't want small government.
[02:18:29.131 --> 02:18:37.997]  And, um, we're seeing the difference, I think, for the 30s is in the 30s, the United States was a, you know, more of a capitalist country.
[02:18:38.057 --> 02:18:43.280]  We had more individual freedom and we still had a God-fearing society.
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:44.461]  We were less domesticated.
[02:18:45.521 --> 02:18:46.862]  And today that's gone.
[02:18:46.942 --> 02:18:50.843]  We've lost a lot of the religious basis of America.
[02:18:50.863 --> 02:18:53.084]  That's what's so tragic about Phyllis Schlafly.
[02:18:53.845 --> 02:19:01.348]  And the political parties are acting as if they're completely an elite who have the right to control everything.
[02:19:01.408 --> 02:19:11.072]  I mean, the GOP and the Democrats alike are saying, you know, this would be a good party, a good political party, the GOP or the Democratic Party, except for the voters.
[02:19:11.874 --> 02:19:14.355]  That's why they can't stand voters.
[02:19:14.395 --> 02:19:18.937]  Do they really believe their spin that they count and voters don't and they're really drinking their own Kool-Aid?
[02:19:18.957 --> 02:19:21.517]  Because are we seeing true megalomania here, Dr. Corsi?
[02:19:21.537 --> 02:19:21.778]  Yes.
[02:19:22.218 --> 02:19:23.258]  They really believe it.
[02:19:23.358 --> 02:19:25.859]  They believe that they know the best for everybody.
[02:19:25.879 --> 02:19:31.041]  Karl Rove and Paul Ryan and the few who are making millions in Washington.
[02:19:31.601 --> 02:19:43.069]  You know, the gravy train of the consultants and all the special interests don't want to give up their power, don't want to give up their money, either in the GOP or in the Democratic Party.
[02:19:43.469 --> 02:19:45.430]  There's a fundamental agreement in Washington.
[02:19:45.971 --> 02:19:49.633]  Keep the power in Washington, and the rest of the country, forget it.
[02:19:49.673 --> 02:19:50.634]  Put them on welfare.
[02:19:50.654 --> 02:19:55.357]  If they're not useful, they can be eliminated in the next global war.
[02:19:55.377 --> 02:19:56.097]  It doesn't matter.
[02:19:56.117 --> 02:20:01.121]  We've got 90 million people in the United States that the economy doesn't need anymore to work.
[02:20:01.721 --> 02:20:03.123]  What are you going to do with these $90 million?
[02:20:03.143 --> 02:20:05.505]  What if one of the $90 million gets to be $120 million?
[02:20:06.306 --> 02:20:09.849]  Do you think the GOP or the Democrats have a plan for that?
[02:20:09.910 --> 02:20:10.530]  No, they don't.
[02:20:10.590 --> 02:20:12.112]  They need a way to deal with the baby boomers.
[02:20:12.152 --> 02:20:20.420]  And you show your sophistication as a top financial analyst for the biggest corporations out there and a guy that's worked in all sorts of highest level ops.
[02:20:21.121 --> 02:20:25.985]  The elite literally look at it like a ballot sheet and look at all these excess people and want to get rid of them.
[02:20:26.226 --> 02:20:28.488]  And that's why they're pushing war, famine and globalism.
[02:20:28.808 --> 02:20:32.131]  That's agenda 21 that you've written books on, been in films on.
[02:20:32.652 --> 02:20:39.057]  This is really where they flipped out and believe collapse and austerity and war is going to cleanse the earth.
[02:20:39.518 --> 02:20:42.380]  And it's really just an excuse for them to have total power and control.
[02:20:43.397 --> 02:20:45.518]  Well, the clericalists never want to eliminate themselves.
[02:20:45.578 --> 02:20:47.018]  I mean, that's always the irony of it.
[02:20:47.559 --> 02:20:49.379]  But everybody else is worthless to them.
[02:20:49.439 --> 02:20:53.561]  There's no fundamental respect for human life or human beings.
[02:20:54.321 --> 02:21:02.605]  And, you know, you're seeing right now in the Republican Party, Ted Cruz someday is going to wake up and realize he's just being used.
[02:21:02.665 --> 02:21:03.305]  Karl Rove
[02:21:03.925 --> 02:21:08.528]  They have no intention, the GOP establishment, of allowing Ted Cruz to be the candidate.
[02:21:08.548 --> 02:21:11.930]  They've got Ryan and Kasich and all of them shooting up.
[02:21:11.970 --> 02:21:13.671]  Jeb Bush, the whole bunch of them.
[02:21:13.711 --> 02:21:20.014]  I mean, though, they're likely to pick a Jeb Bush-Ryan or, you know, run Mitt Romney and Ryan again.
[02:21:20.054 --> 02:21:21.035]  They don't really care.
[02:21:21.475 --> 02:21:26.378]  The GOP does not mind losing the presidency to Hillary Clinton.
[02:21:26.958 --> 02:21:28.119]  I've said this repeatedly.
[02:21:28.619 --> 02:21:30.280]  They're happy with a Clinton presidency.
[02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:31.661]  They're happy with an Obama.
[02:21:31.761 --> 02:21:32.842]  We can't survive that.
[02:21:34.073 --> 02:21:42.477]  Well, it's a nice pact because everybody, you know, remains fat and happy in Washington, and the people get told in an election what they want to hear.
[02:21:43.017 --> 02:21:47.179]  Tea Party sends conservatives, they think, to Washington.
[02:21:47.319 --> 02:21:48.900]  Won't Hillary go for it all?
[02:21:48.960 --> 02:21:50.601]  I mean, that's what the criminology shows.
[02:21:50.841 --> 02:21:53.362]  If she gets in, people think she's dangerous now.
[02:21:53.422 --> 02:21:54.043]  My God!
[02:21:54.063 --> 02:22:00.806]  Well, I mean, the Clintons are going to take the Clinton Foundation scam to, you know, to the billion-dollar level.
[02:22:00.826 --> 02:22:02.467]  They've already had the hundreds of millions.
[02:22:03.027 --> 02:22:06.289]  Now they're going to start selling government favors for billions of dollars.
[02:22:06.369 --> 02:22:09.031]  I mean, we might as well become like Argentina.
[02:22:09.071 --> 02:22:10.772]  We're going to become a banana republic.
[02:22:11.352 --> 02:22:14.674]  Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton and the elite will get rich.
[02:22:14.734 --> 02:22:16.315]  They'll fly around in their jet airplanes.
[02:22:16.375 --> 02:22:18.137]  They'll go to their Lolita Islands.
[02:22:18.617 --> 02:22:20.118]  They'll have all their sex affairs.
[02:22:20.138 --> 02:22:21.519]  They'll have all the drugs they want.
[02:22:22.119 --> 02:22:29.344]  And everybody else will be losing their pension money, struggling desperately to work, not able to afford a house.
[02:22:29.524 --> 02:22:30.604]  And here's their problem, though.
[02:22:30.624 --> 02:22:32.906]  They think the military and the police don't know now.
[02:22:33.406 --> 02:22:40.170]  They're actually woken up big time and aren't going to go along with this while they fly around in jetsets while we kill each other in the streets.
[02:22:40.831 --> 02:22:42.932]  Well, and the problem is, look at the border.
[02:22:42.952 --> 02:22:46.034]  The Border Patrol is already saying this is insane.
[02:22:46.074 --> 02:22:48.376]  The Border Patrol is not being permitted to do their job.
[02:22:49.096 --> 02:22:52.419]  And, you know, the economic structure is not going to support this.
[02:22:53.039 --> 02:23:05.449]  We're already at the point where the social welfare systems, the debt levels in the United States and in Europe and around the world are at such extreme levels that these debt ridden societies are going to collapse.
[02:23:05.509 --> 02:23:10.332]  Dr. Corsi, I want, when we come back from break, to really focus in on the economy, the IMF.
[02:23:10.352 --> 02:23:12.974]  They're all saying what you said five years ago, a month ago.
[02:23:13.454 --> 02:23:16.436]  We're now approaching the big event that Ron Paul and you have talked about.
[02:23:16.956 --> 02:23:22.500]  But shifting gears into Phyllis Schlafly to kind of show a zoomed-in micro of what's happening.
[02:23:22.920 --> 02:23:23.961]  You heard Stone earlier.
[02:23:24.121 --> 02:23:25.622]  In my experience, he doesn't make stuff up.
[02:23:25.662 --> 02:23:26.622]  It just keeps coming true.
[02:23:26.642 --> 02:23:28.484]  He says he has the sources.
[02:23:28.564 --> 02:23:30.145]  It's confirmed to the highest levels.
[02:23:31.098 --> 02:23:41.285]  That they attempted to take her organization over that is very influential, very powerful, very successful, with a huge list and a bunch of money, and to flip it into Cruz.
[02:23:42.206 --> 02:23:46.409]  If he has the goods and this comes out, this could be devastating mugging an old lady.
[02:23:47.725 --> 02:23:50.107]  Well, I'll be working on this all afternoon.
[02:23:50.147 --> 02:23:51.668]  It'll be my lead story tomorrow.
[02:23:51.688 --> 02:23:59.315]  I'm going to start off with what Roger Stone just said on your program, that it's orchestrated at the highest levels of the Cruz campaign.
[02:23:59.335 --> 02:24:11.244]  I mean, there's literally millions of dollars, I'm not even sure how much, in the endowments of Ego Forum, that this renegade group, all of which have pledged to Cruz every one of these six
[02:24:12.239 --> 02:24:18.943]  Women who are in the renegade board group have pledged their support to Cruz.
[02:24:19.623 --> 02:24:23.626]  They can control Eagle Forum and depose Phyllis Schlafly.
[02:24:23.686 --> 02:24:26.227]  They can change the mission of the society.
[02:24:26.267 --> 02:24:29.489]  They can grab all the money that's there.
[02:24:29.549 --> 02:24:30.930]  And they're not going to succeed.
[02:24:31.830 --> 02:24:36.234]  Is this a bellwether of the thuggery, the spirit of theft going on?
[02:24:36.334 --> 02:24:39.157]  I'm sorry, go ahead, sir.
[02:24:39.177 --> 02:24:40.238]  Well, you're exactly right.
[02:24:40.358 --> 02:24:42.399]  I mean, it's appalling to me.
[02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:56.212]  I mean, here is a woman who is one of the most respected conservatives in America, who I've known for decades, and who has fundamentally fought to preserve the values of family, God, religion, and our culture.
[02:24:56.812 --> 02:24:57.892]  She's a real feminist.
[02:25:19.199 --> 02:25:22.701]  These are fundamental values that Phyllis has elevated.
[02:25:22.741 --> 02:25:27.465]  These women were brought into would be nothing if it hadn't been for Phyllis Schlafly.
[02:25:28.005 --> 02:25:33.209]  And now even one of them, her daughter, is in this group trying to take over the organization.
[02:25:35.111 --> 02:25:40.215]  I quoted yesterday, Kathy Adams gave this interview in the Dallas Morning News.
[02:25:40.255 --> 02:25:47.320]  She's one of the six board members trying to take over Phyllis Schlafly's organization and basically said that
[02:25:48.041 --> 02:25:51.363]  Phyllis supporting Trump was senile, she'd been manipulated.
[02:25:51.383 --> 02:26:06.132]  It was an absolutely appalling interview for a woman to whom Kathy Adams, for 23 years, has been head of Eagle Forum, I believe in California, and here she's turned on her, on Phyllis.
[02:26:06.712 --> 02:26:07.693]  I mean, it's disgraceful.
[02:26:08.073 --> 02:26:11.275]  Phyllis will not roll over and let this happen.
[02:26:11.835 --> 02:26:14.439]  She's a constitutional lawyer of the highest order.
[02:26:14.579 --> 02:26:16.182]  She's got a great group behind her.
[02:26:16.202 --> 02:26:18.766]  I think there should be a serious investigation of this.
[02:26:19.186 --> 02:26:20.228]  Well, I think there should too.
[02:26:20.268 --> 02:26:25.155]  And I think, you know, again, it's what price people are paying to back Trump.
[02:26:26.053 --> 02:26:28.174]  Even within the GOP.
[02:26:29.274 --> 02:26:31.815]  Anybody who's backing Trump is going to get turned on.
[02:26:32.255 --> 02:26:35.257]  Buddy, I've never had the pressure I've got on me right now.
[02:26:35.537 --> 02:26:35.957]  It's bad.
[02:26:36.137 --> 02:26:46.561]  And they're going to come after anybody who supports Trump to destroy you in the process or me in the process of WND and Joseph Farah and everything else to try to
[02:26:47.321 --> 02:26:50.522]  You know, promote Cruz, not so Cruz will win.
[02:26:51.102 --> 02:26:56.485]  And this is where the Cruz supporters have to understand they're being used as dupes.
[02:26:57.025 --> 02:27:00.646]  The Republican leadership is in the news admitting that they're going to not have Cruz.
[02:27:00.946 --> 02:27:01.206]  Right.
[02:27:01.847 --> 02:27:04.948]  And the rules of the Republican convention are not going to be fair.
[02:27:05.028 --> 02:27:15.592]  I think, you know, what Roger Stone is saying with votes being stolen, how can you basically have a primary in a state like Colorado and no one votes?
[02:27:16.192 --> 02:27:20.296]  The GOP is saying, this would be a great party except for the voters.
[02:27:20.376 --> 02:27:22.077]  We really don't need the voters.
[02:27:22.117 --> 02:27:22.858]  They're a nuisance.
[02:27:23.679 --> 02:27:28.083]  And Ted Cruz, who should have said, I don't want to win this way.
[02:27:28.583 --> 02:27:30.044]  That would have been the honorable thing.
[02:27:30.525 --> 02:27:33.147]  He's so desperate to get, what, 30-some
[02:27:34.148 --> 02:27:41.733]  Have you heard the clips where he goes and says, I got the vote, it's a democracy, and Drudge won't say that I won Colorado?
[02:27:41.753 --> 02:27:42.833]  Drudge is lying?
[02:27:43.574 --> 02:27:44.874]  That's inverted reality.
[02:27:44.914 --> 02:27:46.235]  That's like crazy town.
[02:27:46.696 --> 02:27:52.219]  And you're seeing now the Ted Cruz, who is the establishment Ted Cruz, who is a product
[02:27:52.699 --> 02:27:57.521]  Who was aspiring to be a bushy, wanted to be an insider.
[02:27:57.581 --> 02:28:01.023]  He was an insider for years, working Federal Trade Commission.
[02:28:01.063 --> 02:28:06.385]  He wasn't liked enough to be given a post as prestigious as his wife had in the White House.
[02:28:07.145 --> 02:28:10.947]  And when Karl Rove would not give Ted Cruz the blessing,
[02:28:11.567 --> 02:28:13.487]  To be a nominee for the party.
[02:28:13.868 --> 02:28:18.348]  That's when Ted Cruz decided he was going to become an evangelist and embrace the Tea Party.
[02:28:18.929 --> 02:28:21.689]  And it's all been fundamentally a lie.
[02:28:21.729 --> 02:28:22.049]  It isn't.
[02:28:22.069 --> 02:28:35.272]  You know, he was for the... That's right, he came down to Texas to get his big hat and his cowboy boots and went from being an establishment guy to, I'm the evangelist, I'm the greatest patriot ever, and now he's going back to what he really was.
[02:28:35.832 --> 02:28:38.393]  Right, and this all was an act.
[02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:39.991]  That's the problem.
[02:28:40.051 --> 02:28:41.112]  It's all an act.
[02:28:41.153 --> 02:28:51.305]  He fundamentally supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, wrote with Ryan an article in the Wall Street Journal to give it the fast-track authority.
[02:28:51.405 --> 02:28:53.207]  Whereas Trump has never been phony.
[02:28:53.267 --> 02:28:58.594]  He's a nationalist, right-wing in some areas, liberal in others, but he's real and that's why they're scared.
[02:28:58.894 --> 02:29:02.035]  Well, and Trump is going to have a fundamental voter realignment.
[02:29:02.515 --> 02:29:07.555]  You're going to find that people from the Democratic Party are equally tired of being lied to.
[02:29:07.635 --> 02:29:19.898]  I mean, how many years are the African Americans going to vote for Democrats who abuse the African Americans, destroy their families, reduce their economic value, the same way with Hispanics?
[02:29:19.918 --> 02:29:22.718]  The Democratic Party is going to exploit everybody's votes.
[02:29:22.758 --> 02:29:28.019]  And finally, you're going to see a big crossover of workers across America.
[02:29:28.559 --> 02:29:29.820]  Wanting to preserve jobs.
[02:29:59.580 --> 02:30:02.581]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.482 --> 02:30:06.283]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.546 --> 02:30:18.050]  It was George Berkeley that famously said, if a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it make a sound, did it make a sound?
[02:30:18.890 --> 02:30:21.351]  Well, I'm here to give you the answer to that age-old question.
[02:30:21.572 --> 02:30:22.312]  Yes, it did.
[02:30:28.141 --> 02:30:36.929]  And if the American Republic had fallen and no one in the mainstream media told you, would the Republic still be dead?
[02:30:37.589 --> 02:30:38.410]  And the answer is yes.
[02:30:42.233 --> 02:30:46.617]  In 20 plus years on air, I've never seen a demarcation line that clearly shows to me
[02:30:47.722 --> 02:30:58.065]  The full collapse has basically already gone to a point where you can say this country is unrecognizable and we are rapidly accelerating into a nightmare totalitarian system.
[02:30:59.225 --> 02:31:08.668]  We've seen Priebus, the head of the Republican Party, we've seen the head of the Rules Committee, Curly Hewlin or whatever his name is, come out and openly say, listen,
[02:31:10.444 --> 02:31:11.205]  The media's wrong.
[02:31:11.225 --> 02:31:12.245]  You never had a vote.
[02:31:12.365 --> 02:31:13.086]  It doesn't count.
[02:31:13.126 --> 02:31:14.387]  The party picks whoever's there.
[02:31:14.727 --> 02:31:16.368]  You're just here at a fashion contest.
[02:31:16.668 --> 02:31:19.330]  Political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[02:31:20.291 --> 02:31:21.732]  Contrary to popular belief.
[02:31:22.212 --> 02:31:23.693]  Then why are they holding the primaries?
[02:31:24.707 --> 02:31:26.007]  That's a very good question.
[02:31:26.047 --> 02:31:40.952]  Then when myself and Roger Stone and others came out, and simply called for people to go protest and demonstrate and talk to the delegates, and we said, don't be violent, in Cleveland coming up in a few months, they had all their pundits go on TV and say, maybe Roger Stone should be arrested.
[02:31:41.052 --> 02:31:45.113]  This is in a climate with all these incredible attacks on free speech, and it's really creepy.
[02:31:45.513 --> 02:31:47.034]  We are a free society in America.
[02:31:47.054 --> 02:31:48.255]  We're not a third world country.
[02:31:48.555 --> 02:31:50.317]  We don't threaten violence against delegates.
[02:31:50.337 --> 02:31:58.323]  And I think that Reince Priebus and the RNC should move to ban Roger Stone from the convention because we cannot tolerate threats and threats of violence.
[02:31:58.723 --> 02:32:01.905]  They're also stealing states and delegates from Bernie Sanders.
[02:32:02.246 --> 02:32:05.568]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're telling you that they're allowed to make these rules.
[02:32:06.129 --> 02:32:09.211]  But they're taking public taxpayer money by the billions.
[02:32:09.591 --> 02:32:11.773]  And the counties and cities are holding out that we're having
[02:32:12.093 --> 02:32:14.334]  There are public elections where it's one person, one vote.
[02:32:14.775 --> 02:32:22.020]  There are federal and state election laws, like the 1965 Voting Rights Act, that's meant to block this type of racketeering.
[02:32:22.780 --> 02:32:29.044]  Even Jim Crow laws against poor blacks and whites were not this strict or this over the top.
[02:32:29.484 --> 02:32:31.606]  And I'll close with the words of President JFK.
[02:32:32.286 --> 02:32:37.390]  Those that make peaceful revolution impossible, make violent revolution inevitable.
[02:32:38.110 --> 02:32:44.035]  And the power brokers know that and they want to break our will and push forward and want a civil war in this country.
[02:32:44.555 --> 02:32:45.676]  Let's peacefully go out.
[02:32:46.196 --> 02:32:47.257]  Let's sue these people.
[02:32:47.857 --> 02:32:49.419]  Let's donate to political causes.
[02:32:49.459 --> 02:32:50.399]  Let's get involved.
[02:32:50.840 --> 02:32:52.381]  Let's have our minds heard.
[02:32:52.781 --> 02:32:54.562]  Let's expose these political party machines.
[02:32:54.602 --> 02:33:05.691]  Let's do everything we can to stop this illegal criminal takeover of America by a two-party system establishing an oligarchy or dictatorship in this country.
[02:33:06.071 --> 02:33:07.052]  As George Carlin said,
[02:33:07.633 --> 02:33:09.776]  It's a big club, and you ain't in it.
[02:33:11.175 --> 02:33:16.158]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:16.218 --> 02:33:17.959]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:33:40.570 --> 02:33:44.391]  There are times in history when more happens in a couple years than happened in the previous 50 or even 100.
[02:33:45.471 --> 02:34:00.496]  It's not just me saying that now, it's mainline historians, political analysts, anthropologists, sociologists, top PhD psychologists, folks like Dr. Cortsey, who's got doctorates on the economy, you name it, from Harvard.
[02:34:01.516 --> 02:34:02.036]  It's happening.
[02:34:03.823 --> 02:34:16.048]  And the elite are almost more corrupt now because they know it's collapsing, so they're just scrambling to loot whatever they can, which makes the collapse that's coming be even more dangerous.
[02:34:16.068 --> 02:34:21.990]  We're going to go to him in a moment, finish up with the politics and get into the economy with Dr. Corsi.
[02:34:22.370 --> 02:34:23.170]  But understand something.
[02:34:24.171 --> 02:34:29.593]  I don't get up here and talk about scary things because, ooh, we're fear-porn, like the New York Times says.
[02:34:30.692 --> 02:34:33.933]  I've studied history and let me tell you, I am really concerned.
[02:34:34.554 --> 02:34:35.294]  I know I'm right.
[02:34:36.534 --> 02:34:45.438]  I said two months ago they were going to start cancelling caucuses altogether and put articles out and people said, oh you're full of it, when I had the Republicans' leadership saying they were looking at it.
[02:34:47.198 --> 02:34:48.659]  Now Ted Cruz and other people
[02:34:50.069 --> 02:34:56.072]  Have a talking point where they won't even talk about the fact that it was new superdelegates that did this in Colorado and other states.
[02:34:56.872 --> 02:35:01.154]  So again, it's just a total con game where they don't even recognize what's going on.
[02:35:01.194 --> 02:35:07.297]  Kind of like Gibbs famously said, I was told, you know, don't admit there's a drone program, even though it existed publicly for years.
[02:35:07.337 --> 02:35:10.218]  It's like saying, don't admit Times Square existed in New York.
[02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:13.582]  Or Central Park, and you're like, but it's right there.
[02:35:14.122 --> 02:35:15.903]  Don't admit that the Atlantic Ocean is there.
[02:35:15.944 --> 02:35:17.645]  Like, don't admit death panels are in Obamacare.
[02:35:17.925 --> 02:35:19.606]  Don't admit there's a don't-treat list at the VA.
[02:35:20.227 --> 02:35:23.389]  But it's right there.
[02:35:23.569 --> 02:35:26.692]  28 pages, Saudi involvement, criminal elements of the government standing down.
[02:35:27.012 --> 02:35:27.672]  I'm vindicated!
[02:35:28.689 --> 02:35:29.429]  I'm not vindicated.
[02:35:29.449 --> 02:35:30.870]  The FBI said that at the time.
[02:35:31.130 --> 02:35:38.315]  The media then spun what I said about 9-11 to fantastical space beams and stuff that their own operatives put out to discredit it.
[02:35:38.715 --> 02:35:41.016]  They said, I said the firemen blew up the towers.
[02:35:41.056 --> 02:35:41.537]  No, I didn't.
[02:35:41.557 --> 02:35:44.658]  It was the firemen and the police that exposed what happened.
[02:35:45.279 --> 02:35:49.081]  It wasn't our government that did it, but criminal elements that knew Saudi Arabia was running it.
[02:35:49.501 --> 02:35:51.182]  And that's now on 60 Minutes last Sunday.
[02:35:51.262 --> 02:35:51.542]  See?
[02:35:52.083 --> 02:35:52.323]  See?
[02:35:52.603 --> 02:35:53.884]  The truth will always come out.
[02:35:54.064 --> 02:35:55.385]  We're going back to Dr. Corsi in a moment.
[02:35:56.554 --> 02:36:01.478]  WND.com to find his books, his writings, his information, WND.com.
[02:36:02.658 --> 02:36:14.267]  Also, we've got Hillary for Prison t-shirts that everybody should be wearing because they're trying to censor people, trying to say you can't criticize Hillary, trying to tell comedy places, you know, with their actual campaign threatening them, don't criticize her.
[02:36:14.947 --> 02:36:18.049]  We've got to criticize her and call for the FBI to call for her indictment.
[02:36:18.410 --> 02:36:25.234]  We have a new limited edition shirt, very similar to the last one, Hillary for Prison 2016 to the end of time on the back, LegalizeFreedomInfoWars.com.
[02:36:26.783 --> 02:36:28.684]  And your purchase makes it all possible here.
[02:36:29.164 --> 02:36:39.107]  We have our flagship product that's got 175 studies behind it on knowing for regrowing nerves and what it does to the mitochondrial DNA, just the bio PQQ alone in it.
[02:36:39.647 --> 02:36:43.369]  DNA force is the best nutraceutical we could come up with.
[02:36:43.529 --> 02:36:44.869]  And it's just simply amazing.
[02:36:45.529 --> 02:36:48.090]  Super metal vitality, lung cleanse.
[02:36:48.110 --> 02:36:52.252]  The other products are just the very best concentrated herbs you can imagine on so many fronts.
[02:36:52.392 --> 02:36:55.453]  And your purchase again makes the entire broadcast possible.
[02:36:56.374 --> 02:36:59.102]  So many of the products that were out of stock are back in stock, like Brain Force.
[02:36:59.322 --> 02:37:00.285]  It's a true nootropic.
[02:37:01.601 --> 02:37:07.685]  Read the reviews, check out the products from Liver Shield to Deep Cleanse, to the different parasite cleanse products we have.
[02:37:08.346 --> 02:37:10.287]  These are the very best nutraceuticals.
[02:37:10.307 --> 02:37:27.679]  When I go to the top labs in the country and say, I want the magic product that your top scientists would want, because most people in nutraceuticals put out some decent stuff, but cheap stuff, have a lot of pills in the bottle, so you think you're getting a good deal, put a bunch of marketing into it, and there's $3 a product in it, and it's 30 bucks.
[02:37:28.760 --> 02:37:31.663]  If we're selling something for 30 bucks, there's like $18 a product in it.
[02:37:31.803 --> 02:37:33.524]  Nobody we know of does this, okay?
[02:37:34.425 --> 02:37:35.806]  These are the very best products.

[02:37:51.380 --> 02:37:54.523]  Okay, going back to Dr. Corsi of WND.com.
[02:37:55.680 --> 02:38:03.986]  Dr. Corsi, finishing up with the election, what you expect to happen and where this is going, do you think the establishment has miscalculated?
[02:38:04.146 --> 02:38:05.307]  Is it showing their hubris?
[02:38:06.247 --> 02:38:08.429]  Do they realize how upset people are?
[02:38:08.609 --> 02:38:11.051]  And where do you think all this is going?
[02:38:11.869 --> 02:38:16.113]  Well, I think the establishment is clearly miscalculated.
[02:38:16.373 --> 02:38:25.381]  GOP leaders are in fantasy land thinking that they can rig the delegates so that they can throw the convention into chaos.
[02:38:26.542 --> 02:38:28.463]  The American people know the difference.
[02:38:28.503 --> 02:38:31.226]  American people want voting in Colorado.
[02:38:31.286 --> 02:38:34.428]  We have a primary without voting.
[02:38:35.069 --> 02:38:45.471]  I mean, by the time we get to that point, you know, the absurdity, the complete moral hollowness, the duplicity of the mainstream media is so obvious.
[02:38:45.531 --> 02:38:47.891]  Of course, Drudge is pounding it.
[02:38:47.971 --> 02:38:53.332]  And, you know, Drudge and you and Alex, we're all trying to get to this point of saying, this is ridiculous.
[02:38:53.432 --> 02:38:54.953]  This is not democracy.
[02:38:54.993 --> 02:38:57.353]  This is an elite rigging and stealing.
[02:38:57.413 --> 02:39:01.094]  And then Cruz and the media, Fox News I watched this morning, acted like
[02:39:02.453 --> 02:39:07.022]  That Trump was crazy, but they just showed him saying it's rigged and then wouldn't say it was rigged.
[02:39:07.243 --> 02:39:08.606]  They go, hey Trump, why are you mad?
[02:39:08.646 --> 02:39:09.748]  The voters have spoken.
[02:39:10.129 --> 02:39:11.531]  I've never seen Fox lie like that.
[02:39:12.196 --> 02:39:14.337]  Well, Fox is also anti-Trump.
[02:39:14.357 --> 02:39:18.779]  They're also, you know, supporting Megyn Kelly, who Trump has exposed.
[02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:25.623]  Trump has really made it clear that, you know, Fox is increasingly part of the establishment.
[02:39:25.643 --> 02:39:31.025]  Look at how many Democratic analysts they have on Fox anymore, compared to what they had 10 years ago.
[02:39:31.045 --> 02:39:34.787]  I mean, the point is, I think the American people are tired of this.
[02:39:34.927 --> 02:39:38.109]  And I think Donald Trump is the real deal.
[02:39:38.129 --> 02:39:39.710]  I've known Donald Trump for years.
[02:39:40.290 --> 02:39:43.212]  Donald Trump takes his own advice, he has his own thinking.
[02:39:43.773 --> 02:39:48.357]  He is truly someone who can negotiate and it won't be tough.
[02:39:48.397 --> 02:39:53.120]  The establishment is afraid of him because he won't follow their rules.
[02:39:53.461 --> 02:39:55.102]  They know Ted Cruz will.
[02:39:55.462 --> 02:40:03.029]  You know, they put a biscuit in front of Ted Cruz and say, get on your hind legs, put your paws up and bark and Ted Cruz is happy to do it.
[02:40:03.806 --> 02:40:04.986]  He's doing it right now.
[02:40:05.087 --> 02:40:11.469]  I mean, you know, for the idea that he's going to gain 30 delegates in Colorado and he'll sell his soul.
[02:40:12.049 --> 02:40:18.632]  He has no more chance of winning, you know, the GOP nomination than Herbert Hoover does.
[02:40:18.672 --> 02:40:25.895]  What do you make of all his operatives going on shows and saying, arrest Roger Stone and don't let people demonstrate in Cleveland?
[02:40:25.915 --> 02:40:28.876]  I mean, did I wake up in Romania under Ceausescu?
[02:40:29.716 --> 02:40:40.238]  Well, you know, the operatives, this is one of the other problems in the Cruz campaign, is operatives, including Rick Tyler, who you had on, was discredited and fired.
[02:40:40.258 --> 02:40:44.179]  These are the kinds of dirty tricks the Cruz campaign has played.
[02:40:44.199 --> 02:40:53.001]  If it's such an honest and tea party and, you know, for-the-people populist campaign, why are there so many out?
[02:40:53.741 --> 02:40:54.402]  I don't know.
[02:41:06.583 --> 02:41:09.026]  Vote and then we'll take the delegates.
[02:41:09.086 --> 02:41:10.687]  But do it this way, I won't take them.
[02:41:11.108 --> 02:41:12.689]  Ted Cruz is not going to do that.
[02:41:12.730 --> 02:41:16.794]  He's going to scramble after 20 delegates as if it makes any difference.
[02:41:17.294 --> 02:41:23.020]  I think you're going to see in New York and see in Pennsylvania massive voting for Trump.
[02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:24.121]  It's going to backfire.
[02:41:24.181 --> 02:41:26.283]  Everything attempted on Trump has backfired.
[02:41:26.864 --> 02:41:28.645]  But Trump is in the fight of his life.
[02:41:29.306 --> 02:41:30.566]  And Roger Stone knows it.
[02:41:30.626 --> 02:41:39.009]  Roger Stone is doing everything he can to alert people to the theft that's going on of the election by the GOP establishment.
[02:41:39.289 --> 02:41:39.529]  Sure.
[02:41:39.669 --> 02:41:45.531]  And what's going to come down the pike is Hillary Clinton is as guilty as any criminal has ever been.
[02:41:46.291 --> 02:41:50.952]  And she is going to have to be indicted or the American people aren't going to tolerate it.
[02:41:50.972 --> 02:41:54.373]  You know, I'll have a book coming out in the summer about it as well.
[02:41:54.393 --> 02:41:57.294]  I'm incensed about the Clinton Foundation.
[02:41:57.714 --> 02:42:00.598]  I've never seen such naked corruption and somebody not get in trouble.
[02:42:00.658 --> 02:42:09.550]  I mean, the elite are crazy trying to install her when, in a way it's good because it's going to blow up in their face, but she may just, you know, start war with the Russians.
[02:42:09.590 --> 02:42:09.950]  Who knows?
[02:42:09.990 --> 02:42:12.053]  Speaking of that... I think everybody should get your...
[02:42:13.795 --> 02:42:17.738]  Hillary, you know, for prison t-shirts.
[02:42:17.778 --> 02:42:18.738]  You're right on.
[02:42:18.818 --> 02:42:20.639]  This is exactly what's going on.
[02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:23.861]  The Clinton Foundation is a criminal enterprise.
[02:42:23.921 --> 02:42:26.923]  It has stolen hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:42:27.444 --> 02:42:34.548]  It has done it at the expense of poor people, the expense of people who have suffered tragedies like in Haiti or India, earthquakes.
[02:42:34.808 --> 02:42:36.551]  They're horrible, nasty people.
[02:42:36.571 --> 02:42:37.333]  The worst of the worst.
[02:42:37.513 --> 02:42:42.942]  Here's Ted Cruz on Trump yesterday calling Colorado voterless win democracy.
[02:42:42.962 --> 02:42:44.785]  And then I've got a longer clip where he says it three times.
[02:42:45.306 --> 02:42:47.309]  Drudge won't report I won.
[02:42:48.646 --> 02:42:48.986]  Well, no.
[02:42:49.026 --> 02:42:50.406]  Drudge is reporting there was no vote.
[02:42:50.466 --> 02:42:51.287]  It's insane!
[02:42:51.627 --> 02:42:53.367]  Well, Drudge is reporting what you're reporting.
[02:42:53.407 --> 02:42:58.288]  Drudge is seeing through the hypocrisy.
[02:42:58.328 --> 02:42:59.949]  He's seeing through the duplicity.
[02:43:00.309 --> 02:43:00.849]  The lie.
[02:43:01.369 --> 02:43:02.769]  And he's exposing the lie.
[02:43:02.809 --> 02:43:03.810]  Well, how could he not?
[02:43:03.910 --> 02:43:05.630]  They're canceling elections.
[02:43:05.730 --> 02:43:06.090]  I mean, look.
[02:43:06.450 --> 02:43:08.731]  This shows how morally bankrupt the Republican leadership is.
[02:43:08.771 --> 02:43:09.611]  Let's play the short clip.
[02:43:09.831 --> 02:43:10.891]  Dr. Jerome Corsi is with us.
[02:43:11.091 --> 02:43:11.751]  Here's Ted Cruz.
[02:43:12.131 --> 02:43:13.972]  The latest thing he seized upon
[02:43:15.029 --> 02:43:20.256]  By the way, our computer malfunctioned and sped that up, but I'm kind of glad it did.
[02:43:20.577 --> 02:43:21.518]  It was pretty funny.
[02:43:33.834 --> 02:43:36.055]  That showed a whole new dimension to Ted Cruz.
[02:43:36.115 --> 02:43:40.295]  Look, Ted Cruz is going to say anything he can at this point.
[02:43:40.335 --> 02:43:43.856]  He's just going to be used to block Donald Trump.
[02:43:43.896 --> 02:43:45.657]  Ted Cruz will never get the nomination.
[02:43:46.237 --> 02:43:47.097]  He's a pawn.
[02:43:47.517 --> 02:43:48.637]  He's being used as a pawn.
[02:43:48.657 --> 02:43:53.258]  He'll be thrown away by the establishment GOP as fast as they use them.
[02:43:53.298 --> 02:43:59.400]  Sure, do you think they're arrogant enough, like Karl Rove has said on TV, that they are just going to maybe put a fresh face in with no votes?
[02:44:00.100 --> 02:44:01.902]  Yes, I think it's very possible.
[02:44:02.442 --> 02:44:03.223]  And look at the money.
[02:44:03.603 --> 02:44:07.286]  Look at the, you know, the GOP money it's gone to.
[02:44:07.907 --> 02:44:16.975]  Mark Levin, for instance, they bought something like, you know, $400,000 of Mark Levin's book, The Cruise Campaign, people supporting Cruise did.
[02:44:17.395 --> 02:44:21.298]  That's all engineered by Karl Rove.
[02:44:21.359 --> 02:44:23.660]  Karl Rove knows that he can buy
[02:44:25.657 --> 02:44:35.992]  By the way, I don't want to dislike Mark Levin or Glenn Beck, but man, they are really showing themselves.
[02:44:36.012 --> 02:44:37.574]  I mean, it's scary.
[02:44:37.615 --> 02:44:40.398]  I'm really ashamed of the conservative movement.
[02:44:41.219 --> 02:44:58.567]  And I'm appalled how, you know, I've done everything I can starting yesterday to support Phyllis, because Phyllis is the kind of person who's really built the conservative movement, and now you've got a set of Cruz operatives who have taken over the organization, want to throw Phyllis out, grab the money, and run it their way.
[02:44:58.587 --> 02:45:07.992]  I mean, it's intolerable that, you know, a 91-year-old woman who's built this organization should have to face a coup from the very people whose careers she built
[02:45:08.672 --> 02:45:13.756]  Cruz Cruz is really treacherous and I guess he feels like he's got the backing of the establishment now and thinks he's invincible.
[02:45:21.271 --> 02:45:26.055]  Well, you know, Karl Rove and the others will make him feel this way, and they'll play to his ego.
[02:45:26.516 --> 02:45:31.740]  But as I said, he is really showing his true colors, who he is.
[02:45:31.780 --> 02:45:43.050]  You know, you'll find right below the surface, you've got the guy who was down at the border handing out teddy bears to, you know, supposedly the unaccompanied minors who were flooding his office.
[02:45:43.070 --> 02:45:45.112]  Sickening stunts you'd see out of Obama.
[02:45:45.888 --> 02:45:49.031]  Right, and constant hypocrisy from Cruz.
[02:45:49.051 --> 02:45:58.442]  That's the part of it, as I researched it deeper, because, you know, like you, Alex, when he first came on the scene as a senator, we were all inclined to think, hey, this is a Tea Party conservative.
[02:45:58.862 --> 02:46:07.612]  The more you look at his background, you find Goldman Sachs all over the place, loans that he didn't disclose, you find the globalism in support of free trade,
[02:46:08.212 --> 02:46:09.073]  Open borders.
[02:46:09.133 --> 02:46:16.039]  This is every bit as much Ted Cruz, a globalist, as is Karl Rove and the other GOP establishment.
[02:46:16.359 --> 02:46:18.001]  He is a Washington insider.
[02:46:18.061 --> 02:46:19.362]  That's where his career came from.
[02:46:19.382 --> 02:46:22.184]  He is a George W. Bush loyalist.
[02:46:22.985 --> 02:46:28.570]  He worked in the Bush recount in Florida.
[02:46:29.030 --> 02:46:32.173]  A lot of the engineering for that was disliked by the Bush people.
[02:46:32.233 --> 02:46:33.715]  Nobody seems to like Ted Cruz.
[02:46:34.375 --> 02:46:40.779]  And so he got a job in the FTC, parked in the FTC, where he spent years in Washington as a Washington insider.
[02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:51.346]  His wife was put onto the Condi Rice's staff and she did the Council on Foreign Relations report with Robert Pastor on tour to North American community.
[02:46:51.366 --> 02:46:53.747]  It was the architecture for the North American Union.
[02:46:53.767 --> 02:46:57.210]  She is a key super gopher for the ultra top.
[02:46:57.910 --> 02:46:59.652]  And that's exactly what the cruisers are.
[02:46:59.712 --> 02:47:07.779]  If they got into power, which they're not going to get, they're just going to be the spoil Trump movement.
[02:47:08.299 --> 02:47:10.301]  And I think that Trump is doing a good job.
[02:47:10.361 --> 02:47:12.663]  Roger Stone is fighting every day to expose it.
[02:47:13.243 --> 02:47:15.365]  And, of course, Roger's going to take a lot of heat from it.
[02:47:15.385 --> 02:47:17.267]  He's going to take an enormous amount of heat.
[02:47:17.287 --> 02:47:20.069]  You know, Stone is working, I know for a fact, 18 hours a day.
[02:47:20.109 --> 02:47:21.070]  The guy is a maniac.
[02:47:21.390 --> 02:47:22.551]  I get texts at 6 a.m.
[02:47:22.571 --> 02:47:23.832]  in the morning and at 1 a.m.
[02:47:24.853 --> 02:47:25.453]  And phone calls.
[02:47:25.954 --> 02:47:27.354]  And he also knows what he's doing.
[02:47:27.394 --> 02:47:29.935]  He goes back in politics decades.
[02:47:29.995 --> 02:47:30.656]  He was there.
[02:47:30.676 --> 02:47:32.036]  Mary Goldwater.
[02:47:32.076 --> 02:47:33.257]  He saw the convention.
[02:47:33.297 --> 02:47:38.479]  He, you know, knew Richard Nixon, worked with Nixon, worked in the Reagan administration.
[02:47:38.519 --> 02:47:39.199]  He's been there.
[02:47:39.239 --> 02:47:40.560]  He knows what he's talking about.
[02:47:41.140 --> 02:47:49.164]  And when Stone says that by the rules, they're going to, you know, in Washington, a few lawyers are going to try to steal the convention.
[02:47:49.844 --> 02:47:51.246]  It's something to pay attention to.
[02:48:05.826 --> 02:48:06.806]  Where are we really?
[02:48:06.866 --> 02:48:07.806]  What's the next big shooter?
[02:48:07.826 --> 02:48:15.268]  I've been talking about corporate defaults, state defaults, the shale oil boom crash in North America, the situation with the Saudis.
[02:48:15.768 --> 02:48:17.108]  I mean, it's time-bombing.
[02:48:17.408 --> 02:48:23.250]  Worried IMF cuts, world growth forecast, warns over BRICS exit from EU.
[02:48:23.890 --> 02:48:27.310]  They're hitting the panic button saying they're going to zero or negative interest rates.
[02:48:27.590 --> 02:48:29.091]  What does all this signify in two minutes?
[02:48:29.331 --> 02:48:29.831]  Dr. Corsi.
[02:48:30.191 --> 02:48:36.273]  Well, I think, first of all, you're going to see the Federal Reserve, which is, by the way, privately owned.
[02:48:36.353 --> 02:48:37.693]  It's not a government institution.
[02:48:38.273 --> 02:48:43.834]  It's going to do everything it can to keep pumping money in to keep the stock market up, at least through the election.
[02:48:44.595 --> 02:48:48.195]  They don't want to have the establishment exposed by the crash that we're going to have.
[02:48:48.596 --> 02:48:49.976]  The crash is going to start in Europe.
[02:48:49.996 --> 02:48:51.236]  It's going to start in the EU.
[02:48:51.776 --> 02:48:53.757]  The EU is going to begin falling apart.
[02:48:54.437 --> 02:48:57.740]  That's flooded with Muslim terrorists.
[02:48:57.760 --> 02:49:02.545]  These refugees are going to see more Brussels attacks, more taxes in France.
[02:49:03.386 --> 02:49:09.172]  The Islamic radicals who are coming into Europe are not going to assimilate into the European society.
[02:49:09.192 --> 02:49:12.075]  They're going to try to destroy European society.
[02:49:12.675 --> 02:49:18.081]  I suspect the EU is going to start breaking up this year, and the financial collapse is going to begin in Europe.
[02:49:18.661 --> 02:49:24.466]  Again, in Greece, I think Greece and Great Britain could both pull out from the EU this year.
[02:49:24.486 --> 02:49:27.309]  By the way, while you're saying this, there's a giant thunderstorm overhead.
[02:49:27.389 --> 02:49:28.650]  It made me get chills up my back.
[02:49:29.310 --> 02:49:32.513]  I mean, I know the left captured us, the globalists run us.
[02:49:33.014 --> 02:49:35.576]  Why do they want to bring five million jihadis in to kill us?
[02:49:36.036 --> 02:49:36.497]  Why?
[02:49:36.637 --> 02:49:39.079]  Why do they hate prosperity and nice stuff?
[02:49:39.659 --> 02:49:42.061]  We're going to have basically a structure where
[02:49:42.964 --> 02:49:44.805]  The world economy collapses.
[02:49:45.566 --> 02:49:47.987]  And in the collapse, again, remember these crises?
[02:49:48.007 --> 02:49:53.351]  They'll have this collapse occurring at the same time the Middle East is moving towards a nuclear war.
[02:49:53.371 --> 02:49:58.254]  And the only forces that are going to be able to stop it, I mean, once the United States
[02:49:59.194 --> 02:50:00.756]  We've lost our moral compass.
[02:50:00.796 --> 02:50:02.958]  We've lost our economic strength.
[02:50:03.418 --> 02:50:08.023]  Our military is being dramatically depleted to levels it hasn't been in modern times.
[02:50:08.163 --> 02:50:10.265]  Obama has done this intentionally.
[02:50:10.405 --> 02:50:12.948]  We're run by acolytes of the heirs communists.
[02:50:13.008 --> 02:50:15.010]  I mean, what elite would put those people in?
[02:50:15.530 --> 02:50:19.172]  And don't think that the left and right aren't in cooperation with this.
[02:50:19.212 --> 02:50:26.057]  At the highest level, you know, the GOP Republicans would be happy to have Hillary Clinton win.
[02:50:26.477 --> 02:50:40.046]  And Hillary and her people are stealing the election of the GOP on the Democratic side, just as Karl Rove and the others are trying to... So this is really the attempted full takeover by multinationals and crime syndicates.
[02:50:40.066 --> 02:50:40.526]  We're seeing it.
[02:50:40.666 --> 02:50:48.156]  Disregarding, disregarding the middle class, disregarding the average person, throwing God out of the country, and having no hesitation.
[02:50:48.216 --> 02:50:50.739]  Is this really the fall of America if they succeed right now?
[02:50:51.380 --> 02:51:03.211]  Yes, this is the last chapter unless we have an opportunity to take back the fundamental values of the country, and that's what Donald Trump is fighting for, and it's going to be the fight of his life.
[02:51:03.391 --> 02:51:04.632]  Well, God bless you, Dr. Kors.
[02:51:04.652 --> 02:51:05.933]  We look forward to talking to you a lot more.
[02:51:06.454 --> 02:51:07.074]  Godspeed.
[02:51:07.115 --> 02:51:08.716]  This is the final chapter in America.
[02:51:08.756 --> 02:51:09.256]  This is it.
[02:51:09.477 --> 02:51:09.797]  This is it.
[02:51:10.297 --> 02:51:13.480]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[02:51:13.540 --> 02:51:15.803]  Introducing Deep Cleanse by InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:51:16.423 --> 02:51:23.110]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[02:51:23.410 --> 02:51:28.596]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[02:51:28.696 --> 02:51:37.545]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[02:51:37.805 --> 02:51:46.409]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[02:51:46.649 --> 02:51:53.552]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spigyrex herbal processing technique.
[02:51:53.692 --> 02:51:59.835]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best price out there.
[02:52:00.055 --> 02:52:00.776]  My name is Alex Jones.
[02:52:00.796 --> 02:52:07.219]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:52:07.320 --> 02:52:08.540]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[02:52:21.548 --> 02:52:35.695]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[02:52:36.075 --> 02:52:43.899]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[02:52:44.099 --> 02:52:50.522]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels
[02:52:51.523 --> 02:52:57.248]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[02:52:57.368 --> 02:53:03.694]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[02:53:03.854 --> 02:53:08.918]  Check them out today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[02:53:08.938 --> 02:53:11.601]  Brain Force is here.
[02:53:12.141 --> 02:53:14.403]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:53:14.684 --> 02:53:17.086]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused.
[02:53:17.507 --> 02:53:22.483]  Less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:53:23.257 --> 02:53:26.399]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[02:53:26.700 --> 02:53:26.840]  Right?
[02:53:26.860 --> 02:53:29.202]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:53:29.562 --> 02:53:33.085]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:53:33.125 --> 02:53:36.267]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:53:36.767 --> 02:53:41.571]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:53:42.112 --> 02:53:43.933]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[02:53:44.293 --> 02:53:48.717]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:53:48.877 --> 02:53:50.878]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:53:51.499 --> 02:53:53.000]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:53:53.120 --> 02:53:53.360]  Exactly.
[02:53:53.380 --> 02:53:57.185]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:53:57.685 --> 02:54:04.974]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:54:05.234 --> 02:54:05.674]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[02:54:16.332 --> 02:54:18.875]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[02:54:18.915 --> 02:54:21.237]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[02:54:21.317 --> 02:54:24.280]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[02:54:24.360 --> 02:54:29.145]  And everybody knew he didn't give no lift to Big John.
[02:54:29.746 --> 02:54:31.828]  Big John.
[02:54:31.928 --> 02:54:33.590]  Big John.
[02:54:33.710 --> 02:54:34.951]  Big Bad John.
[02:54:35.352 --> 02:54:36.973]  Big Bad John.
[02:54:38.235 --> 02:54:39.276]  Big John.
[02:54:41.388 --> 02:54:44.013]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home.
[02:54:44.053 --> 02:54:46.738]  He just drifted into town and stayed all alone.
[02:54:46.758 --> 02:54:51.186]  Didn't say much, kinda quiet and shy, but he didn't spoke at all.
[02:54:51.226 --> 02:54:53.049]  He just said hi to Big John.
[02:54:55.293 --> 02:55:06.239]  Somebody said he came from New Orleans where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen and a crashing blow from a huge right hand sent a Louisiana fella to the promised land.
[02:55:06.379 --> 02:55:07.100]  Big John.
[02:55:07.720 --> 02:55:09.941]  Big John.
[02:55:10.302 --> 02:55:11.022]  Big John.
[02:55:11.642 --> 02:55:13.964]  Big John.
[02:55:14.084 --> 02:55:15.885]  Big Bad John.
[02:55:15.945 --> 02:55:16.765]  Gotta shut that off.
[02:55:16.785 --> 02:55:17.846]  That's some good stuff right there.
[02:55:20.461 --> 02:55:27.742]  We've got David Knight coming up and I'm going to have him kick off right at the start of the fourth hour.
[02:55:27.762 --> 02:55:30.563]  He'll have obviously tons of new breaking news and information.
[02:55:31.643 --> 02:55:42.245]  Rob Dew and Joe Biggs and crew are going out to the Friday demonstration at the RNC in Denver to protest that they canceled the popular vote there and just gave it to his lordship.
[02:55:45.005 --> 02:55:47.666]  And there's been chicanery and hanky-panky and
[02:55:49.352 --> 02:55:58.918]  Dirty tricks before, but nothing of this magnitude and nothing so naked where they then deny they did it and act like Roger Stone, Matt Drudge, myself and others are lying.
[02:56:00.319 --> 02:56:06.103]  And the bullying that goes on behind the scenes to get behind Ted Cruz is truly sickening.
[02:56:07.844 --> 02:56:14.969]  I've been experiencing stuff and I'm not going to even get into it because when you work with people and you do things and stuff's off record, it's off record.
[02:56:16.230 --> 02:56:17.551]  That's just the way it is, but
[02:56:19.665 --> 02:56:20.826]  America's seen as weak.
[02:56:22.047 --> 02:56:26.610]  You got a bunch of TV heads, you got a bunch of dumbed-down young people, and believe me, I'm pretty young myself.
[02:56:26.770 --> 02:56:34.375]  There's a lot of awake young people too, but, I mean, really, you look at the college students and high school students, I mean, they're either totally awake and really alive, or they look like they're dead.
[02:56:34.856 --> 02:56:35.396]  Zombos.
[02:56:37.337 --> 02:56:39.018]  And the system thinks we're a bunch of chumps.
[02:56:39.139 --> 02:56:40.239]  They think that we're done.
[02:56:40.299 --> 02:56:40.960]  They think it's over.
[02:56:42.572 --> 02:57:05.693]  And that's why they're just announcing, hey, we're getting rid of cash, hey, we're going to take money right out of your bank account, hey, foreign banks front America, hey, we're getting ready for a collapse, new banker bailouts, hey, we're going to raise taxes on the poor and exempt the rich, and we're going to arrest whoever we want, we're going to give you forced inoculations, and world government's here, and you're going to let 10,000 Chinese women fly in a week, it was a month, and get free health care and free babies, and
[02:57:06.414 --> 02:57:15.478]  Mexico can have a wall and torture people that come across, but we can't have any security, and Donald Trump's evil, and it's just this fad-driven, idiot-based society.
[02:57:18.179 --> 02:57:21.300]  And there's articles yesterday and today in four different papers.
[02:57:21.960 --> 02:57:22.941]  Today it's in what?
[02:57:23.161 --> 02:57:25.502]  The New York Times and the Providence Journal.
[02:57:26.622 --> 02:57:29.043]  Climate change deniers deserve punishment!
[02:57:30.370 --> 02:57:32.352]  I thought it was man-made global warming deniers.
[02:57:32.432 --> 02:57:33.814]  Oh, now if I deny climate change.
[02:57:34.054 --> 02:57:36.036]  I don't deny climate change, you jackasses.
[02:57:36.617 --> 02:57:38.218]  The Russians broke into your emails.
[02:57:38.799 --> 02:57:44.785]  Globally at the UN, East Anglia managing it, where hundreds of universities were coordinating.
[02:57:45.346 --> 02:57:45.726]  What?
[02:57:46.287 --> 02:57:47.068]  Five years ago?
[02:57:49.250 --> 02:57:51.873]  Hiding the decline in temperature globally.
[02:57:54.994 --> 02:58:02.017]  We've caught you with your filthy hands in the cookie jar over and over again, so you want to arrest us?
[02:58:05.179 --> 02:58:15.043]  All these traders with a scheme to hijack the West economies, turn our coal power plants off that were like 70% of our power a decade ago, now it's like 40-something.
[02:58:16.524 --> 02:58:18.165]  You want to know why your electricity is so high?
[02:58:18.325 --> 02:58:19.285]  Why the jobs are leaving?
[02:58:19.866 --> 02:58:22.467]  Number one, our power is expensive!
[02:58:24.824 --> 02:58:25.745]  Why obsess on it?
[02:58:25.785 --> 02:58:26.686]  Nobody talks about it.
[02:58:27.267 --> 02:58:28.288]  You can build a coal plant.
[02:58:28.408 --> 02:58:29.369]  We will bankrupt you.
[02:58:32.852 --> 02:58:34.394]  That means bankrupt America.
[02:58:34.654 --> 02:58:36.176]  What's the first thing a foreign enemy does?
[02:58:36.856 --> 02:58:37.797]  Destroy the generator.
[02:58:37.898 --> 02:58:39.399]  Let me use a Star Wars analogy.
[02:58:39.439 --> 02:58:40.160]  Empire Strikes Back.
[02:58:40.460 --> 02:58:41.241]  The Imperial Walker.
[02:58:41.761 --> 02:58:42.722]  You may start your landing.
[02:58:42.763 --> 02:58:43.804]  We've reached the shield generator.
[02:58:44.747 --> 02:58:45.688]  Target, shield generator.
[02:58:46.048 --> 02:58:47.109]  Maximum firepower!
[02:58:47.289 --> 02:58:48.770]  They've blown our generators!
[02:58:48.990 --> 02:58:50.271]  Our generators are down!
[02:58:50.451 --> 02:58:51.112]  We're down!
[02:58:51.132 --> 02:58:52.533]  We're under enemy attack!
[02:58:52.793 --> 02:58:54.474]  They want to bankrupt you to control you!
[02:58:54.574 --> 02:58:56.416]  InfoWars.com!
[02:58:56.516 --> 02:58:58.197]  Fight these people!
[02:58:58.237 --> 02:58:59.518]  Now they're taking your votes!
[02:59:01.161 --> 02:59:02.522]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:59:02.822 --> 02:59:04.102]  You can't survive without it.
[02:59:04.303 --> 02:59:05.203]  But where do you get it?
[02:59:05.503 --> 02:59:11.266]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:59:11.486 --> 02:59:17.209]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:59:17.409 --> 02:59:34.254]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[02:59:34.654 --> 02:59:36.775]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[02:59:37.135 --> 02:59:38.335]  Stainless steel construction.
[02:59:38.615 --> 02:59:39.375]  Easy assembly.
[02:59:39.636 --> 02:59:40.276]  Low maintenance.
[02:59:40.556 --> 02:59:42.376]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[03:00:02.532 --> 03:00:07.034]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:11.276 --> 03:00:12.177]  Another world.
[03:00:12.197 --> 03:00:12.817]  Another time.
[03:00:13.257 --> 03:00:13.797]  In the age of
[03:00:38.287 --> 03:00:42.270]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:42.931 --> 03:00:48.916]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:52.018 --> 03:00:53.319]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:53.339 --> 03:00:55.280]  I'm David Knight, your host on this fourth hour.
[03:00:56.138 --> 03:01:11.450]  You know, when I was listening to Alex Jones interview Roger Stone earlier, and they were talking about how people were misportraying the call for us to get involved, saying that's a call for violence, you know, just like they said when Donald Trump said, hey, if you try to steal this, there's going to be riots, okay?
[03:01:11.470 --> 03:01:12.390]  No, you're threatening people.
[03:01:13.051 --> 03:01:23.259]  Listen, isn't it interesting that Cruz can go to these states like Colorado, he can twist arms, he can lobby delegates, and it's just politics.
[03:01:24.175 --> 03:01:31.082]  But if we, the people, want to twist arms and lobby the delegates, that's a call to violence.
[03:01:31.102 --> 03:01:32.163]  You understand how that works?
[03:01:33.104 --> 03:01:35.866]  Because, you see, we're not stakeholders.
[03:01:36.187 --> 03:01:38.289]  We don't have a voice.
[03:01:39.250 --> 03:01:41.772]  Vox Populi doesn't exist anymore, okay?
[03:01:42.112 --> 03:01:43.293]  Shut up and sit down.
[03:01:43.654 --> 03:01:44.555]  This isn't your party.
[03:01:46.084 --> 03:01:46.784]  This is their party.
[03:01:47.585 --> 03:01:49.286]  And they'll burn it down if they want to.
[03:01:49.886 --> 03:01:52.027]  Remember that link that was on Drudge yesterday?
[03:01:52.067 --> 03:01:53.148]  I don't know if you saw that or not.
[03:01:53.248 --> 03:01:54.388]  Alex may have talked about it today.
[03:01:55.309 --> 03:01:58.550]  There was an angry letter from somebody in Colorado saying, you're going to do this?
[03:01:59.091 --> 03:02:02.072]  I am going to abandon the GOP.
[03:02:02.152 --> 03:02:04.594]  You're going to lose people for a generation.
[03:02:04.634 --> 03:02:07.755]  He wrote that to the Colorado GOP chair.
[03:02:08.135 --> 03:02:09.456]  And the guy said, OK, fine.
[03:02:09.536 --> 03:02:10.256]  Burn down the party.
[03:02:10.437 --> 03:02:10.897]  He didn't care.
[03:02:11.721 --> 03:02:12.441]  You know, it's his party.
[03:02:12.481 --> 03:02:13.501]  He'll cry if he wants to.
[03:02:13.561 --> 03:02:14.762]  If he doesn't want to, he won't.
[03:02:15.102 --> 03:02:19.343]  Because, you know, really, they don't care if the party burns down.
[03:02:19.983 --> 03:02:21.403]  They want to burn this country down.
[03:02:21.463 --> 03:02:32.105]  It's what I've seen all over this country when I go and talk to the people, the loggers who've had their economies shut down by the federal government, the ranchers, the miners, everyone across this country.
[03:02:32.185 --> 03:02:36.286]  They are willing to literally burn down areas of Oregon
[03:02:37.634 --> 03:02:40.296]  So that they can take over everything.
[03:02:40.436 --> 03:02:46.520]  The only thing that's being built in John Day, Oregon are federal facilities for bureaucracies.
[03:02:47.300 --> 03:02:52.023]  They have allowed the fuel to set there on the ground, literally burning this industry down.
[03:02:52.043 --> 03:03:03.790]  And you know when this logger, when we interviewed him, we went out there after what happened in Oregon, we spent the time talking to the people that Lavoie Finnegan and the others were on their way to talk to.
[03:03:03.810 --> 03:03:04.331]  They had 400 people there.
[03:03:05.799 --> 03:03:07.020]  They were gaining traction.
[03:03:07.060 --> 03:03:08.682]  That's why they had to arrest those people.
[03:03:08.722 --> 03:03:10.264]  That's why they had to kill LaVoy Finnegan.
[03:03:10.624 --> 03:03:13.267]  So we wanted to talk to them and understand what they were doing.
[03:03:13.287 --> 03:03:15.149]  So we talked to the guy who organized that rally.
[03:03:15.189 --> 03:03:17.912]  He was someone who had worked all of his life in that area as a logger.
[03:03:18.713 --> 03:03:20.375]  He didn't want to destroy the forest.
[03:03:20.415 --> 03:03:21.776]  He wanted to manage the forest.
[03:03:22.237 --> 03:03:23.838]  It's the government that wants to destroy it.
[03:03:24.159 --> 03:03:27.843]  And he accused the government of deliberately destroying all of this.
[03:03:29.502 --> 03:03:32.063]  And you know, I was listening to The Pentagon's Brain.
[03:03:32.103 --> 03:03:36.026]  I do that once in a while when I really get fired up on my way in.
[03:03:36.046 --> 03:03:37.186]  I listened to that book.
[03:03:37.226 --> 03:03:39.007]  We interviewed the author, Annie Jacobson.
[03:03:40.128 --> 03:03:43.169]  Excellent book, going back, talking about DARPA's history.
[03:03:44.070 --> 03:03:45.531]  They were talking about Vietnam.
[03:03:45.551 --> 03:03:54.976]  They were talking about Agent Orange and how they wanted to try to deforest, go through a policy of deforestation there to try to remove the cover that the Viet Cong had.
[03:03:56.308 --> 03:03:59.869]  So they came up with Agent Orange, but they really couldn't get it done with that.
[03:03:59.909 --> 03:04:06.572]  They wanted to try to set fires, but they said, you know what, we can't set fires unless we can get sufficient fuel on the ground.
[03:04:06.592 --> 03:04:09.353]  We've got to have a lot of underbrush and things.
[03:04:09.393 --> 03:04:10.333]  They understood that.
[03:04:10.793 --> 03:04:12.634]  Every forester understands that.
[03:04:12.734 --> 03:04:14.134]  Forestry departments understand that.
[03:04:14.194 --> 03:04:17.576]  My uncle was head of the forestry department at the University of Missouri.
[03:04:18.476 --> 03:04:19.276]  He understood that.
[03:04:19.916 --> 03:04:26.238]  He was complaining 40 years ago about how the government was following a policy that was going to burn our forest down.
[03:04:26.258 --> 03:04:26.978]  What do we see now?
[03:04:27.378 --> 03:04:37.860]  Here where I live in Texas, just south of Austin, Bastrop community, I think it was like 97% of the place burned down before I moved here to Austin.
[03:04:38.180 --> 03:04:38.540]  Why?
[03:04:38.960 --> 03:04:39.961]  Because of fuel on the ground.
[03:04:40.001 --> 03:04:40.841]  What'd they do afterwards?
[03:04:40.861 --> 03:04:41.881]  They came back and told people,
[03:04:43.035 --> 03:04:46.096]  Clear up deadwood on the ground, but see, the government doesn't do that.
[03:04:46.877 --> 03:04:51.239]  The government pursues, at the top, understand, there's two different levels of government.
[03:04:51.259 --> 03:04:54.480]  The people who are setting the policy want to burn this place down.
[03:04:54.520 --> 03:04:57.061]  I'm not saying the people who are living there don't want to do it.
[03:04:57.542 --> 03:05:02.904]  The 4th Street people at that level don't want to see it, but they've been brainwashed by the people who know what they're doing.
[03:05:03.104 --> 03:05:03.964]  They want to burn it down.
[03:05:04.305 --> 03:05:04.945]  That's what they're doing.
[03:05:04.965 --> 03:05:08.306]  They're burning down this economy, and we're not supposed to say anything about it.
[03:05:08.466 --> 03:05:08.767]  Stay with us.
[03:05:08.787 --> 03:05:09.307]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:10.718 --> 03:05:14.000]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[03:05:14.180 --> 03:05:16.442]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[03:05:16.622 --> 03:05:25.009]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[03:05:25.270 --> 03:05:28.612]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[03:05:28.772 --> 03:05:39.061]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[03:05:39.401 --> 03:05:46.666]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[03:05:46.866 --> 03:05:48.767]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[03:05:49.107 --> 03:05:56.692]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[03:05:57.072 --> 03:06:03.214]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[03:07:10.731 --> 03:07:12.272]  My name is Alex Jones.
[03:07:12.652 --> 03:07:18.595]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:07:18.816 --> 03:07:19.956]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[03:07:21.377 --> 03:07:35.521]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[03:07:35.881 --> 03:07:39.982]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[03:07:43.903 --> 03:07:46.405]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated.
[03:07:46.726 --> 03:07:48.227]  My muscle mass increased.
[03:07:48.447 --> 03:07:51.009]  My stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[03:07:51.330 --> 03:07:57.014]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[03:07:57.195 --> 03:08:03.420]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.

[03:08:24.938 --> 03:08:27.021]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:08:27.561 --> 03:08:32.628]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:08:36.440 --> 03:08:54.465]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight and as I was just saying as we were in the break when I was listening to Roger Stone talk to Alex Jones about the misportrayal of what the two of them have been talking about in terms of trying to get activists to the convention in Cleveland to lobby the delegates to find out where these delegates are.
[03:08:55.365 --> 03:08:56.666]  And then they portray that as violence.
[03:08:56.706 --> 03:09:03.652]  I was saying, you know, Cruz can go to Colorado or these caucuses or these non-election events.
[03:09:04.453 --> 03:09:06.375]  He can twist arms, he can lobby delegates, okay?
[03:09:06.395 --> 03:09:07.836]  And it's just politics.
[03:09:08.016 --> 03:09:08.977]  He's just winning.
[03:09:08.997 --> 03:09:09.998]  Okay?
[03:09:10.738 --> 03:09:21.688]  But if you or I were to do that, if we the people were to go to these delegates, if we were to twist their arms and lobby them, then we would be threatening them with violence.
[03:09:22.654 --> 03:09:23.716]  You see the double standard there?
[03:09:24.256 --> 03:09:31.427]  See, the corrupt criminal insiders can hatch their conspiracies in smoke-filled rooms and it's not racketeering.
[03:09:31.708 --> 03:09:36.575]  But if you or I want to get involved in the political process, we are dangerous, okay?
[03:09:36.715 --> 03:09:37.857]  You want to really get dangerous?
[03:09:38.792 --> 03:09:42.195]  Have a protest and carry some weapons with you.
[03:09:42.575 --> 03:09:42.915]  Legally.
[03:09:43.456 --> 03:09:47.199]  So you have a legal free speech protest and you carry some weapons with you.
[03:09:47.679 --> 03:09:48.319]  Now we've done that.
[03:09:48.900 --> 03:09:53.303]  As a matter of fact, my sons who went and filmed a couple of those early on
[03:09:54.384 --> 03:10:00.272]  So do you know the only time we haven't been hassled is when it's a demonstration with armed people.
[03:10:00.753 --> 03:10:02.575]  It's the only time the cops have left us alone.
[03:10:02.956 --> 03:10:05.359]  That's what the Second Amendment is about.
[03:10:05.959 --> 03:10:08.523]  That is a picture of the Second Amendment.
[03:10:09.084 --> 03:10:11.046]  It's like the mutual assured destruction.
[03:10:11.727 --> 03:10:13.048]  That we had during the Cold War.
[03:10:13.589 --> 03:10:15.871]  It's like, neither side wants to kick this off.
[03:10:16.411 --> 03:10:17.472]  So back off, buddy.
[03:10:18.113 --> 03:10:19.154]  I'll defend myself.
[03:10:19.374 --> 03:10:19.674]  Okay?
[03:10:19.775 --> 03:10:21.596]  That's what the Second Amendment is about.
[03:10:22.137 --> 03:10:23.958]  It's about the government respecting people.
[03:10:24.359 --> 03:10:30.284]  And a good example of this was in San Antonio about two and a half, three years ago.
[03:10:30.304 --> 03:10:31.325]  It was in October 2013.
[03:10:31.385 --> 03:10:34.788]  There was an open carry rally there.
[03:10:35.669 --> 03:10:51.560]  The reason that Open Carry Rally had been called was because we had people who were exercising their Second Amendment rights to open carry, trying to get the people of even Texas to not freak out if they see somebody with a gun and no uniform.
[03:10:52.120 --> 03:10:52.661]  That's scary.
[03:10:52.841 --> 03:10:59.366]  Okay, people with guns, with uniforms, right, they can be armed to the teeth, they can have all kinds of riot gear, and that's okay, that's fine.
[03:10:59.406 --> 03:11:05.792]  They can be riding around fully militarized vehicles like they're in Fallujah or something, no problem, I've got no problem with that.
[03:11:06.372 --> 03:11:08.935]  But a citizen has a gun, whoa, that's scary.
[03:11:09.055 --> 03:11:12.578]  See, it's exactly the opposite of the way it ought to be.
[03:11:12.598 --> 03:11:14.479]  We even have to have in Toy Story,
[03:11:15.100 --> 03:11:17.801]  We have to have Woody, Sheriff Woody, without a gun.
[03:11:18.121 --> 03:11:23.282]  Even the sheriff has no gun in his holster because, you know, he's not dressed in riot gear.
[03:11:23.302 --> 03:11:27.403]  I guess if they had set up Woody in riot gear, that would be okay.
[03:11:27.803 --> 03:11:32.765]  I remember when my sons were young, I wanted to get them some guns so they could play some real stuff, okay?
[03:11:33.965 --> 03:11:37.486]  And I went down to Toys R Us, I should have known better, it's nothing but a bunch of
[03:11:39.438 --> 03:11:42.640]  Marketing gimmicks, you know, they're tied to TV shows and movies.
[03:11:43.081 --> 03:11:43.961]  I wanted to get him something.
[03:11:44.021 --> 03:11:46.343]  I couldn't find any Western guns for them to play with.
[03:11:46.903 --> 03:11:50.566]  All I could find was riot police gear.
[03:11:50.906 --> 03:11:51.867]  Yeah, you could buy that.
[03:11:52.047 --> 03:11:56.850]  You could have your children pretend they're riot police, but, you know, you don't want them to pretend they're John Wayne.
[03:11:57.251 --> 03:11:58.011]  That would be bad.
[03:11:58.291 --> 03:11:59.152]  That'd be scary.
[03:11:59.332 --> 03:12:00.533]  That'd be dangerous, okay?
[03:12:00.593 --> 03:12:01.494]  Or Davy Crockett.
[03:12:02.264 --> 03:12:02.904]  Heaven forbid.
[03:12:03.844 --> 03:12:05.985]  Okay, so I don't want to preface this.
[03:12:06.045 --> 03:12:17.688]  I'm going to tell you that since that rally in 2013, my family has referred to Ted Cruz as Mrs. Nesbitt from Toy Story.
[03:12:18.329 --> 03:12:20.509]  I'll show you the clip so you understand the context in just a moment.
[03:12:20.849 --> 03:12:23.450]  First, let's play this short clip from Hillary Clinton.
[03:12:23.930 --> 03:12:26.071]  That's how gun owners are really terrorists.
[03:12:26.988 --> 03:12:29.350]  Our citizens are the terrorists, right?
[03:12:29.650 --> 03:12:33.132]  We're so worried about terrorism, but we have terrorism on our own soil.
[03:12:33.512 --> 03:12:40.557]  Our gun manufacturers, our ammunition manufacturers are making terrorists out of our citizens.
[03:12:40.917 --> 03:12:41.978]  A sobering fact.
[03:12:42.639 --> 03:12:44.480]  Yeah, see, the citizens are terrorists.
[03:12:44.580 --> 03:12:47.102]  She even says it, this lady there with Hillary Clinton.
[03:12:47.122 --> 03:12:48.903]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's absolutely true.
[03:12:49.563 --> 03:12:50.104]  Absolutely true.
[03:12:51.004 --> 03:12:53.486]  Well, so we had this situation in San Antonio.
[03:12:54.407 --> 03:12:56.068]  I think it's up in Cary, Texas, put it together.
[03:12:57.062 --> 03:13:06.647]  They realized that people who were walking around legally carrying firearms openly, and at the time it was long arms so they could sling over their shoulder, they were getting harassed by the police.
[03:13:07.748 --> 03:13:09.388]  So we said, all right, let's go down there.
[03:13:09.428 --> 03:13:10.909]  They said, let's have a big rally.
[03:13:11.029 --> 03:13:11.849]  So we got behind it.
[03:13:11.889 --> 03:13:12.389]  We supported it.
[03:13:12.429 --> 03:13:23.712]  We had over a thousand people show up, all carrying firearms, in a peaceful rally to demonstrate that, hey, we have a right to legally carry these arms, and we're going to do it.
[03:13:23.872 --> 03:13:28.394]  And we're going to do it at the birthplace of freedom in Texas, the Alamo.
[03:13:28.894 --> 03:13:29.694]  And so that's what we did.
[03:13:29.714 --> 03:13:30.814]  We had a big rally there.
[03:13:30.854 --> 03:13:35.016]  We had the Texas, I think it was land state commissioner,
[03:13:36.836 --> 03:13:37.237]  Was there.
[03:13:37.717 --> 03:13:39.820]  He has control over the monuments.
[03:13:39.860 --> 03:13:40.901]  He allowed that to happen.
[03:13:41.061 --> 03:13:42.944]  We had a lot of political speakers there.
[03:13:43.064 --> 03:13:44.205]  Alex Jones spoke there.
[03:13:44.245 --> 03:13:48.230]  You've probably seen the iconic shot of him in front of the Alamo.
[03:13:49.417 --> 03:13:51.717]  And I was really surprised after that was over.
[03:13:51.757 --> 03:13:53.778]  My wife said, you know, Ted Cruz is here.
[03:13:53.798 --> 03:13:54.418]  I was like, really?
[03:13:54.458 --> 03:13:55.158]  I didn't hear him speak.
[03:13:55.198 --> 03:13:56.018]  I didn't see him anywhere.
[03:13:56.078 --> 03:13:56.658]  No, no, no, no.
[03:13:57.178 --> 03:13:59.599]  He's across the street in the Hyatt.
[03:13:59.619 --> 03:14:00.699]  I was like, what?
[03:14:01.519 --> 03:14:02.159]  You mean we're having this?
[03:14:02.499 --> 03:14:08.140]  This is the guy who is telling us how he's this Mr. Constitution and he's all about the Second Amendment.
[03:14:08.180 --> 03:14:12.021]  Oh, that's the top of his issues if you go to his website, Second Amendment.
[03:14:12.601 --> 03:14:15.962]  And he can't even bother to show up and speak at the Alamo?
[03:14:17.114 --> 03:14:18.315]  Wow, that's really strange.
[03:14:18.975 --> 03:14:22.876]  This guy really is a phony, because I've not trusted him since he ran for Senate.
[03:14:24.137 --> 03:14:39.684]  You got a wife who's a member of Goldman Sachs, you got a wife who's part of the Council on Foreign Relations, you got a wife who works with Robert Zoellick in terms of talking about how they want to have a common border around Mexico, the United States, and Canada, you know, because he's Mr. North American Union President.
[03:14:39.804 --> 03:14:40.964]  He's from Canada, so what?
[03:14:41.004 --> 03:14:42.045]  It's the same country, right?
[03:14:42.825 --> 03:14:44.666]  So he is a natural-born citizen, I guess, right?
[03:14:45.859 --> 03:14:48.221]  So, you got a wife who's into all of that.
[03:14:48.321 --> 03:14:53.626]  I didn't know about the secret loans from Goldman Sachs that he got when he was running.
[03:14:53.686 --> 03:15:01.012]  He didn't want to tell anybody about that, because he was trying to distance himself from Goldman Sachs, from the Council on Foreign Relations, calling them a pet of vipers.
[03:15:01.392 --> 03:15:04.595]  That was a dog whistle, by the way, again, to his Christian community.
[03:15:04.695 --> 03:15:09.139]  Speaking the language, always doing the dog whistle, so it's like, oh yeah, this guy's authentic.
[03:15:09.952 --> 03:15:11.452]  Okay, you saw what he did to Ben Carson.
[03:15:11.472 --> 03:15:12.292]  He's not authentic.
[03:15:12.713 --> 03:15:17.973]  Okay, before the Ben Carson episode, I had a lot of suspicion about him because of that.
[03:15:18.013 --> 03:15:20.494]  And then, it was, I guess it was about a year.
[03:15:20.534 --> 03:15:22.034]  Yeah, it was a year after he had been elected.
[03:15:22.074 --> 03:15:22.694]  He got elected in 2012.
[03:15:23.114 --> 03:15:26.635]  And then October 13, 2013, we're there at the Alamo.
[03:15:26.915 --> 03:15:28.015]  We have an open carry rally.
[03:15:28.535 --> 03:15:30.116]  Massive rally about the Second Amendment.
[03:15:30.256 --> 03:15:33.696]  Everybody is pumped up, but not Ted Cruz, Mr. Second Amendment.
[03:15:33.796 --> 03:15:37.437]  He is across the street speaking to the Tea Party.
[03:15:37.797 --> 03:15:41.943]  Literally, the Tea Party, a bunch of blue-haired GOP women donors, okay?
[03:15:42.404 --> 03:15:45.708]  And here's the article from the San Antonio, my San Antonio at the time.
[03:15:45.888 --> 03:15:50.735]  He was speaking to the Texas Federation of Republican Women at the Grand Hyatt, okay?
[03:15:51.075 --> 03:15:52.457]  So here he is, he can't even...
[03:15:53.018 --> 03:15:56.039]  You know, poke his head out the window and wave to us like royalty.
[03:15:56.099 --> 03:15:58.300]  He's not passionate about the Second Amendment.
[03:15:58.340 --> 03:16:00.381]  This guy is phony about everything.
[03:16:00.421 --> 03:16:01.782]  He's phony about the Constitution.
[03:16:02.242 --> 03:16:04.303]  He won't tell us why he thinks he's qualified.
[03:16:04.323 --> 03:16:07.805]  He won't defend the case that he's a natural-born citizen because he's not, okay?
[03:16:08.245 --> 03:16:09.785]  He's simply a slick lawyer.
[03:16:10.366 --> 03:16:14.728]  And so, when I heard that, we said, oh, he's like Mrs. Nesbitt.
[03:16:14.868 --> 03:16:15.448]  Let's play this.
[03:16:15.468 --> 03:16:18.749]  Remember when you had, but let me set this up before you guys roll this.
[03:16:19.069 --> 03:16:19.850]  Okay, Toy Story.
[03:16:20.742 --> 03:16:27.625]  Yeah, Buzz Lightyear walks in and he finds, or rather, Woody walks in and finds Buzz Lightyear kind of delusional.
[03:16:28.705 --> 03:16:35.828]  And he's dressed, for those of you who are listening on the radio, he's dressed in a hat with an apron and he's having a tea party.
[03:16:36.668 --> 03:16:38.389]  And he says, I'm Mrs. Nesbitt.
[03:16:38.409 --> 03:16:39.149]  Let's roll that clip.
[03:16:39.830 --> 03:16:40.970]  What happened to you?
[03:16:41.030 --> 03:16:47.993]  One minute you're defending the whole galaxy and suddenly you find yourself sucking down Darjeeling with
[03:16:52.985 --> 03:16:55.228]  I think you've had enough tea for today.
[03:16:55.288 --> 03:16:57.070]  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
[03:16:57.090 --> 03:16:58.652]  Don't you get it?
[03:16:58.672 --> 03:16:59.553]  You see the hat?
[03:17:00.434 --> 03:17:02.617]  I am Mrs. Nesbitt!
[03:17:02.977 --> 03:17:04.959]  Snap out of it, Buzz!
[03:17:07.261 --> 03:17:08.742]  Yeah, that's Ted Cruz.
[03:17:08.802 --> 03:17:20.590]  He's Mrs. Nesbitt, and he's been Mrs. Nesbitt in my book and my household ever since he went to a tea party with a bunch of GOP women donors instead of going to the Open Carry Rally.
[03:17:20.610 --> 03:17:21.431]  The guy is a phony.
[03:17:21.491 --> 03:17:23.933]  Let me go to the issues on their website.
[03:17:23.953 --> 03:17:25.774]  Let's talk about a couple of issues here, okay?
[03:17:26.614 --> 03:17:29.977]  When you go to Ted Cruz's website and you look at the issues, here's the ones that he has there.
[03:17:30.037 --> 03:17:31.077]  Restore the Constitution.
[03:17:31.358 --> 03:17:32.178]  Second Amendment rights.
[03:17:32.218 --> 03:17:32.879]  Secure the border.
[03:17:32.919 --> 03:17:33.599]  Defend our nation.
[03:17:33.639 --> 03:17:34.240]  Stand with Israel.
[03:17:35.765 --> 03:17:36.426]  Staying with Israel.
[03:17:37.106 --> 03:17:37.686]  Why single?
[03:17:37.707 --> 03:17:38.027]  Okay.
[03:17:38.327 --> 03:17:43.551]  Religious liberty, life, marriage, and family, jobs and opportunity, and rain and Washington, okay?
[03:17:44.071 --> 03:17:45.693]  You go to Donald Trump, here's his issues.
[03:17:46.313 --> 03:17:54.559]  Pay for the wall, health care reform, U.S.-China trade reform, Veterans Administration reforms, tax reform, Second Amendment rights, immigration reform.
[03:17:55.936 --> 03:18:05.301]  He doesn't have as many issues, but Donald Trump has very detailed, I've never seen as detailed a policy statements from any candidate in all the policy statements I've been looking at.
[03:18:05.321 --> 03:18:08.643]  We're going to look at some of these things, but notice what is missing off of Ted Cruz?
[03:18:09.738 --> 03:18:11.019]  There's nothing about Obamacare.
[03:18:11.199 --> 03:18:18.005]  You see, the reason he was speaking to the Republican women, well, we know the reason he was speaking to them at their tea party, he wanted their money, okay?
[03:18:18.405 --> 03:18:22.008]  But what he was talking to them about was Obamacare.
[03:18:22.729 --> 03:18:24.150]  He was going to do something about Obamacare.
[03:18:24.710 --> 03:18:34.498]  Here he is, he's been running for a long time, and there is absolutely nothing I see on his issues, and I've looked at several of these, and I thought, well, maybe he's got it under Restore the Constitution, or Reign in Washington, or what?
[03:18:34.618 --> 03:18:36.019]  I don't see anything about Obamacare.
[03:18:36.039 --> 03:18:36.320]  You know what?
[03:18:36.700 --> 03:18:37.461]  He doesn't have a plan.
[03:18:38.061 --> 03:18:38.662]  It doesn't have a plan.
[03:18:38.902 --> 03:18:39.763]  I've talked about this before.
[03:18:40.044 --> 03:18:45.790]  How many times have we been lied to by the GOP establishment saying they're going to get rid of Obamacare and they don't have a plan to get rid of it?
[03:18:46.151 --> 03:18:47.492]  They don't have a plan to replace it.
[03:18:47.833 --> 03:18:50.756]  They don't have a plan because they don't plan to do anything about it!
[03:18:51.581 --> 03:18:53.082]  They wave this in front of you.
[03:18:53.383 --> 03:19:02.571]  Again, it's another dog whistle for their loyal pack of followers to get you to vote for them, and they have absolutely no intention of doing anything about it.
[03:19:02.611 --> 03:19:06.535]  If you go to Donald Trump's site, yo, health care reform is one of the big things up there.
[03:19:06.555 --> 03:19:06.835]  Why?
[03:19:07.136 --> 03:19:12.521]  Because he knows, like immigration reform, he knows that health care reform was what Republicans wanted.
[03:19:13.141 --> 03:19:16.484]  And it's what the Republican politicians like Ted Cruz won't do anything about.
[03:19:17.281 --> 03:19:18.081]  Won't do anything about it.
[03:19:18.441 --> 03:19:19.302]  They don't have a plan.
[03:19:19.462 --> 03:19:20.722]  They don't plan to do anything about it.
[03:19:21.282 --> 03:19:25.763]  If you look at, and we've mentioned this before, if you look at Donald Trump, he's got a very detailed health care plan.
[03:19:25.783 --> 03:19:27.464]  He's got seven detailed points.
[03:19:27.524 --> 03:19:29.144]  First one, eliminate the mandate.
[03:19:29.224 --> 03:19:34.886]  Second one, let's get rid of the laws that prohibit competition across state lines.
[03:19:35.546 --> 03:19:37.427]  Do you understand how upside down that is?
[03:19:38.376 --> 03:19:43.579]  We have the globalists like Ted Cruz and Paul Ryan who want to have free trade, they say.
[03:19:43.679 --> 03:19:53.726]  So we need to turn over the management of our economy to a foreign international commission that's going to dictate to us what trades and taxes and tariffs and what our industries are going to be allowed to have.
[03:19:54.386 --> 03:20:03.212]  But then within the United States, Ted Cruz and the Republican Party don't even talk about the fact that we aren't allowed to have competition between insurance companies within the United States.
[03:20:03.492 --> 03:20:06.314]  So they don't even support free trade in the United States and yet
[03:20:06.934 --> 03:20:08.515]  They're exporting our jobs, folks.
[03:20:08.575 --> 03:20:09.316]  That's the point.
[03:20:09.376 --> 03:20:18.721]  They don't want- We are witnessing an unprecedented coming out of the closet by tyrants.
[03:20:19.902 --> 03:20:27.247]  Barack Obama represents the top five megabanks and the Fortune 100 that are owned and controlled by this group.
[03:20:27.907 --> 03:20:32.690]  They are establishing an open world government where they are above the law.
[03:20:34.497 --> 03:20:51.767]  But at the domestic level, they want dictators or communist or fascist systems to control the population, to extract the wealth to the offshore combines that again are above the law, tax-exempt, and have diplomatic and regulatory immunity.
[03:20:52.668 --> 03:21:01.793]  That's what President Obama was talking about a few weeks ago when he traveled to Argentina to say there's not much difference between capitalism and communism.
[03:21:02.330 --> 03:21:06.512]  In the past, there's been a sharp division between left and right.
[03:21:07.312 --> 03:21:11.273]  Between capitalists and communists or socialists.
[03:21:11.773 --> 03:21:15.215]  And especially in the Americas, that's been a big debate, right?
[03:21:16.015 --> 03:21:21.637]  Ah, you know, you're a capitalist Yankee dog.
[03:21:21.977 --> 03:21:27.479]  And I think for your generation, you should be practical and just choose from what works.
[03:21:29.747 --> 03:21:50.624]  The controlled corporate media no longer criticizes Cuba and its massive human rights violations, or China's intensifying violations, killing Buddhists in Falun Gong, peaceful people who weren't even protesting, and selling their organs that are chopped out of their bodies in mobile execution vans.
[03:21:51.384 --> 03:21:53.386]  Ten years ago, our government did criticize it.
[03:21:53.786 --> 03:21:54.187]  No more.
[03:21:54.847 --> 03:21:57.908]  And it's because our system is going totalitarian.
[03:21:58.728 --> 03:22:02.288]  This is the fall of America that we're witnessing right now.
[03:22:02.729 --> 03:22:07.289]  And that's why it's more important than ever that you use your First Amendment or lose it.
[03:22:08.210 --> 03:22:09.910]  InfoWars is the tip of the spear.

[03:24:23.680 --> 03:24:24.500]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[03:24:24.520 --> 03:24:36.984]  I want to go back and talk about the difference between Donald Trump's health care plan, his Obamacare plan, if you want, his Obamacare replacement plan, and Ted Cruz's no plan.
[03:24:37.704 --> 03:24:38.164]  Just a moment.
[03:24:38.484 --> 03:24:43.186]  But before we do, I want to tell you that we have DNA Force Plus is now back in stock.
[03:24:43.226 --> 03:24:45.607]  Of course, DNA Force has been sold out for quite some time.
[03:24:45.627 --> 03:24:48.448]  It's one of our best-selling nutraceuticals.
[03:24:49.008 --> 03:24:50.449]  It has been out of stock for quite some time.
[03:24:50.469 --> 03:24:54.551]  It is now back in stock, and it is now DNA Force Plus.
[03:24:54.631 --> 03:25:01.495]  It has a new special ingredient, very powerful ingredient, for the same price, however, as the original DNA Force.
[03:25:01.515 --> 03:25:03.556]  It's been sold out for months, now back in stock.
[03:25:03.596 --> 03:25:10.160]  And of course, DNA Force is loaded with the patented BioPQQ compound, backed by 175 clinical studies.
[03:25:10.680 --> 03:25:17.544]  Extremely hard to secure, very expensive ingredient there, but also it contains a lot of other very powerful
[03:25:18.564 --> 03:25:19.165]  I think so.
[03:25:34.443 --> 03:25:35.183]  Reservatrol.
[03:25:35.463 --> 03:25:36.824]  It's extremely hard to produce.
[03:25:36.964 --> 03:25:46.308]  We run out of it very often and we're out of it when we do for months because it is so difficult to produce and so expensive to produce in each batch.
[03:25:46.348 --> 03:25:49.970]  Right now DNA Force is back and it's DNA Force Plus.
[03:25:50.150 --> 03:25:54.011]  Same price as the original DNA Force but with a new powerful ingredient.
[03:25:54.232 --> 03:25:56.973]  You can find that at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:25:58.233 --> 03:25:59.694]  Just before the break we were talking about
[03:26:01.960 --> 03:26:16.776]  Ted Cruz, who did not want to show up to the Second Amendment rally, the giant open carry rally that we had at the Alamo back in 2013, he was speaking to Republican women, Republican donors, at a Tea Party meeting to get money to say that it was all about Obamacare.
[03:26:16.796 --> 03:26:21.040]  But you look at his website and I don't see what he wants to do about Obamacare.
[03:26:21.461 --> 03:26:22.182]  I know he's a Ginnett.
[03:26:22.742 --> 03:26:24.643]  I don't know what he's planning to do again.
[03:26:24.984 --> 03:26:25.264]  Okay?
[03:26:25.304 --> 03:26:26.985]  He's never come up with a plan.
[03:26:27.365 --> 03:26:28.346]  He doesn't have a plan.
[03:26:28.846 --> 03:26:31.989]  If you have no plan, if you failed a plan, you're planning to fail.
[03:26:32.009 --> 03:26:33.409]  And that's what they've been planning to do.
[03:26:33.450 --> 03:26:39.714]  They want that issue to hang around just like abortion has hung around for decades.
[03:26:39.774 --> 03:26:42.576]  It's a useful thing for them and for the Democrats, okay?
[03:26:42.836 --> 03:26:44.657]  Except the Republicans are losing on that issue.
[03:26:45.018 --> 03:26:47.279]  So that's an important issue for them to keep hanging around.
[03:26:47.679 --> 03:26:51.102]  But let's take a look at Donald Trump because that is actually one of his issues.
[03:26:51.582 --> 03:26:54.924]  And as I was just starting to go down his plan, I think it's worthwhile to take a look at it.
[03:26:54.944 --> 03:26:55.985]  He's got seven points.
[03:26:56.545 --> 03:26:59.687]  First one is to repeal the mandate, the individual mandate.
[03:26:59.707 --> 03:27:06.211]  Yeah, let's instead of having a mandate, instead of holding a gun to somebody's head, let's have voluntary incentives, okay?
[03:27:06.672 --> 03:27:08.413]  And then he allows things like
[03:27:09.298 --> 03:27:10.940]  You can deduct this from your income tax.
[03:27:10.980 --> 03:27:12.041]  See, there's an incentive.
[03:27:12.221 --> 03:27:13.062]  It's a voluntary thing.
[03:27:13.102 --> 03:27:15.545]  You can decide to do it or not, but it gives you an incentive to do it.
[03:27:15.825 --> 03:27:22.733]  You know, if health care is so important, and it is, why can't the government let us deduct more of it from our taxes?
[03:27:23.214 --> 03:27:23.875]  We pay taxes.
[03:27:23.895 --> 03:27:24.635]  Okay?
[03:27:25.296 --> 03:27:25.697]  They don't.
[03:27:26.097 --> 03:27:28.881]  They have very high threshold before you're allowed to deduct anything.
[03:27:29.441 --> 03:27:33.827]  But of course what he's saying is, you know, you'd be able to deduct your health insurance premiums from your tax returns.
[03:27:33.847 --> 03:27:39.674]  You would also be able to set up health savings accounts, okay, and contributions in them that would also be tax-free.
[03:27:39.855 --> 03:27:41.336]  You would also own that.
[03:27:41.897 --> 03:27:47.101]  You could even pass it on in your estate to your family if you saved money.
[03:27:47.141 --> 03:27:49.623]  So you want to give people incentives to save money.
[03:27:49.723 --> 03:27:51.024]  Oh, and you want to give them the mechanism.
[03:27:51.245 --> 03:27:59.311]  You want to give them an ability to know and shop the prices by providers, by health care providers and hospitals.
[03:27:59.912 --> 03:28:00.973]  That's in here as well.
[03:28:01.133 --> 03:28:03.014]  Require price transparency.
[03:28:03.395 --> 03:28:04.415]  Open up a free market.
[03:28:04.816 --> 03:28:07.898]  So you can't have insurance companies competing across state lines right now.
[03:28:07.938 --> 03:28:08.519]  That's prohibited.
[03:28:09.141 --> 03:28:17.105]  Wait a minute, I thought these Republicans and Democrats who are pushing these transatlantic and transpacific partnerships, they're all about free trade, aren't they?
[03:28:18.806 --> 03:28:19.567]  Not in America.
[03:28:19.987 --> 03:28:20.627]  Not in America.
[03:28:20.667 --> 03:28:23.589]  You don't want competition amongst the insurance providers.
[03:28:23.649 --> 03:28:23.969]  Why?
[03:28:24.029 --> 03:28:27.991]  Because they're the ones who wrote Obamacare to increase their profits.
[03:28:28.071 --> 03:28:32.034]  Competition hurts their profits, so they don't want that competition.
[03:28:32.850 --> 03:28:44.326]  So basically what you do is you open the marketplace up, you give people ownership, you give them the information and the ability to shop and save, you give them an incentive because they have ownership in it.
[03:28:45.216 --> 03:28:52.859]  And then he does things like remove barriers to entry into the free market by drug providers that offer safe and cheaper products, okay?
[03:28:52.899 --> 03:28:54.259]  We need to have more competition.
[03:28:54.279 --> 03:29:00.481]  The FDA is a large component of the price cost here, and the pharmaceutical industry loves that.
[03:29:01.141 --> 03:29:09.044]  We need to open up some of that in terms of generics, but that's what they're doing the exact opposite of with the Trans-Pacific and the Trans-Atlantic Partnership.
[03:29:09.624 --> 03:29:10.905]  So there are some real things that we could do.
[03:29:11.957 --> 03:29:15.738]  And you know, nobody talks about Donald Trump's health care program.
[03:29:16.738 --> 03:29:17.858]  It's a very detailed program.
[03:29:18.298 --> 03:29:19.378]  It's all free market stuff.
[03:29:19.798 --> 03:29:22.259]  It's all really stuff, he didn't dream this up.
[03:29:22.339 --> 03:29:24.159]  It's not some crazy, wacko idea.
[03:29:24.179 --> 03:29:30.861]  This is all stuff I've been seeing in conservative and libertarian think tanks and free market think tanks.
[03:29:30.901 --> 03:29:37.942]  I've been seeing this for 25 years because, you know, it's 25 years ago that Hillary Clinton wanted to take over health care.
[03:29:38.945 --> 03:29:46.209]  And at that point, there were a lot of think tanks that started coming up with, what can we do to make health care more affordable, to control the cost, did all these things.
[03:29:46.249 --> 03:29:47.730]  So they've been working on this for a long time.
[03:29:47.910 --> 03:29:48.730]  He put it all together.
[03:29:49.151 --> 03:29:50.351]  Nobody wants to talk about that.
[03:29:50.391 --> 03:29:52.092]  They want to say, Donald Trump, you know.
[03:29:52.112 --> 03:29:53.453]  They don't want to talk about his issues.
[03:29:53.473 --> 03:29:54.854]  They want to say, he has issues.
[03:29:55.014 --> 03:29:56.975]  No, he's got real issues to talk about.
[03:29:56.995 --> 03:29:57.955]  They just won't talk about that.
[03:29:57.995 --> 03:29:59.576]  They try to talk about his personality.
[03:29:59.596 --> 03:30:00.417]  Stay with us, we'll come back.
[03:30:00.757 --> 03:30:02.358]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.298 --> 03:30:05.980]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[03:32:08.793 --> 03:32:13.116]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[03:32:13.276 --> 03:32:15.537]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[03:32:15.717 --> 03:32:24.103]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[03:32:24.363 --> 03:32:29.106]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it after consulting top doctors.
[03:32:29.266 --> 03:32:45.760]  Nutritionist, pharmacist and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[03:32:45.980 --> 03:32:47.861]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[03:32:48.202 --> 03:32:55.768]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[03:32:55.828 --> 03:32:57.149]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[03:32:57.209 --> 03:32:57.970]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[03:32:58.010 --> 03:32:59.731]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend.
[03:33:25.672 --> 03:33:30.354]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[03:33:31.314 --> 03:33:34.015]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:34.075 --> 03:33:35.175]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[03:33:35.215 --> 03:33:50.821]  And of course, as we look at this election, one of the things that we, even we, who have been looking at this for a very long time, and I've been involved in the past in third party politics, I've watched how they rigged this to the benefit, the exclusive benefit of the Republican and Democrat Party.
[03:33:51.881 --> 03:33:58.889]  And I've watched the mainstream Democrats and Republican voters believe that this is some kind of an open, honest process.
[03:33:58.949 --> 03:34:00.110]  I know that it's very rigged.
[03:34:00.130 --> 03:34:01.812]  I've seen how many different ways they rig it.
[03:34:01.852 --> 03:34:05.536]  And of course, the counting of the votes itself is very easily rigged.
[03:34:05.576 --> 03:34:07.538]  We've talked about that in the past.
[03:34:07.558 --> 03:34:11.842]  We've talked about the connections with the voting machine company Smartmatic.
[03:34:12.523 --> 03:34:22.626]  Connected to George Soros via the guy who runs Smartmatic now, is the guy who was vice chair of George Soros' Open Foundations Society.
[03:34:23.740 --> 03:34:28.123]  Also, former vice president of either the World Bank or the IMF fund.
[03:34:28.143 --> 03:34:29.164]  I think it was the World Bank.
[03:34:29.244 --> 03:34:29.924]  I can't remember now.
[03:34:30.044 --> 03:34:37.650]  Nevertheless, this is a guy who is thoroughly connected with the globalist agenda, and the company itself began in Venezuela by Hugo Chavez.
[03:34:38.310 --> 03:34:40.612]  Hugo Chavez used it to rig his elections.
[03:34:40.652 --> 03:34:48.277]  He's been involved in multiple rigging of elections throughout Central and South America, especially in Brazil, where the socialist president who won
[03:34:49.319 --> 03:34:58.146]  In spite of the fact that she was roundly booed by 60,000 people at a World Cup event, down by 10 points, and then all of a sudden she wins with the Smartmatic machines.
[03:34:59.255 --> 03:35:00.556]  And there was no exit polling.
[03:35:00.996 --> 03:35:11.902]  And the company that normally would do exit polling took a powder, and then took a lot, millions of dollars of subsidies from the government after she won that election.
[03:35:12.322 --> 03:35:13.923]  That's one of the things we need to be concerned about.
[03:35:13.943 --> 03:35:28.111]  You know, here in the United States, when we look at these polls, and I see Ted Cruz in the popular opinion polls is down by 10 and then wins by 10, or he's up by 5 and wins by 20 points the next day, it's like, really?
[03:35:29.076 --> 03:35:31.902]  Do these polls, are these polls just totally meaningless?
[03:35:32.243 --> 03:35:35.529]  Or is there some kind of a rigging going on at the election polls?
[03:35:36.769 --> 03:35:38.110]  We should have some exit polling.
[03:35:38.550 --> 03:35:49.199]  And you can go back in most of these elections, if you look at the polling organizations that go back in and do what they call exit polling, they're not doing exit polling to see if the elections were honest or not.
[03:35:49.239 --> 03:35:53.843]  They're coming back and saying, well, the people who said that they voted for this candidate said they voted for them because of this.
[03:35:54.143 --> 03:35:57.386]  And the people who voted for that candidate said this was the thing they were looking for.
[03:35:57.726 --> 03:36:01.209]  How many people who were evangelicals voted for candidate A?
[03:36:01.229 --> 03:36:02.510]  And how many voted for candidate B?
[03:36:02.790 --> 03:36:04.452]  They don't ever go back in and say, well, you know,
[03:36:05.032 --> 03:36:09.236]  Our exit polls said that candidate A got this percent and candidate B got that percent.
[03:36:09.457 --> 03:36:13.200]  Hmm, that's very different from what we actually got from the actual election.
[03:36:13.261 --> 03:36:14.061]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:36:14.342 --> 03:36:15.383]  That would be very interesting.
[03:36:15.663 --> 03:36:20.828]  But you would never in America ever question the integrity of the electoral system.
[03:36:21.689 --> 03:36:22.110]  Or would you?
[03:36:23.111 --> 03:36:23.811]  Maybe you should.
[03:36:24.252 --> 03:36:25.773]  Maybe you will, beginning now.
[03:36:26.594 --> 03:36:27.855]  And if nothing else happens,
[03:36:28.624 --> 03:36:30.444]  That's a major takeaway.
[03:36:31.105 --> 03:36:34.366]  As part of the wake-up process, folks, let's wake up America.
[03:36:34.806 --> 03:36:36.446]  Of course, we sell that coffee at Infowars.com.
[03:36:36.906 --> 03:36:38.327]  I'm not giving a commercial for that.
[03:36:38.747 --> 03:36:41.367]  I'm telling you, you do need to wake up America.
[03:36:41.907 --> 03:36:42.668]  You need to look at this.
[03:36:42.688 --> 03:36:49.809]  This is being portrayed to us as, this is the headline from Bloomberg, Cruz campaign out-muscles Trump in the Colorado sweep.
[03:36:50.010 --> 03:36:54.231]  And then we've got Rush Limbaugh saying, Ted Cruz isn't cheating, he's winning.
[03:36:56.274 --> 03:36:57.215]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:36:57.776 --> 03:37:03.645]  When you're talking about outmuscling, I mean, this really is a mafia racketeered organization.
[03:37:04.366 --> 03:37:09.354]  And when you talk about whether he's winning or whether he's cheating, is this just politics?
[03:37:10.342 --> 03:37:17.565]  As I pointed out before, you know, when he goes and he twists the arms of delegates and he lobbies them, that's just politics.
[03:37:17.606 --> 03:37:18.266]  But we do that.
[03:37:18.306 --> 03:37:19.366]  We're threatening people.
[03:37:19.967 --> 03:37:21.627]  If we call for that, we're threatening people.
[03:37:21.667 --> 03:37:25.189]  But hey, it's great when an insider lobbies other insiders.
[03:37:25.229 --> 03:37:28.771]  That's approved and that's okay because it's all part of their private party.
[03:37:28.791 --> 03:37:36.635]  And you know, when Rush said that, I thought it was very interesting because not only do I disagree with him, I think it is cheating, I think that
[03:37:37.930 --> 03:37:44.471]  You know, they need to replace the trust Ted background to cheat Ted because that's what he is.
[03:37:44.511 --> 03:37:45.692]  He's a lying thief.
[03:37:47.252 --> 03:37:47.772]  Rush said this.
[03:37:47.812 --> 03:37:52.693]  He said, you know, we could go into a little discussion if you want about insider versus outsider.
[03:37:52.733 --> 03:37:58.074]  And I've tried to tell people these insiders are not just going to let this stuff go, folks.
[03:37:58.454 --> 03:38:01.495]  They're not just going to sit idly by and let you take it away from them.
[03:38:02.115 --> 03:38:02.635]  No, that's right.
[03:38:03.686 --> 03:38:05.748]  Ted Cruz is an insider.
[03:38:06.068 --> 03:38:06.829]  Let's understand that.
[03:38:07.249 --> 03:38:09.251]  Let's understand how this system is rigged.
[03:38:09.511 --> 03:38:11.312]  Let's understand how it's racketeered.
[03:38:11.513 --> 03:38:14.976]  Let's understand who the insiders are and who the outsiders are.
[03:38:15.176 --> 03:38:21.881]  Let's understand this guy with his Goldman Sachs, counsel in foreign relations, George W. Bush connections.
[03:38:22.702 --> 03:38:22.782]  It's
[03:38:43.831 --> 03:38:50.772]  If it went the other way, Ted Cruz wins and pulls in the Bush faction because we're going to reunite the insiders and the outsiders.
[03:38:50.832 --> 03:38:52.593]  No, folks, he was an insider.
[03:38:53.013 --> 03:39:00.514]  And it makes me absolutely sick to see these conservative mouthpieces of the GOP establishment.
[03:39:00.534 --> 03:39:02.434]  Of course, Russia's been that his entire career.
[03:39:03.154 --> 03:39:08.935]  But to see these other people too, like, you know, Levin and Glenn Beck and the red state.
[03:39:08.955 --> 03:39:11.556]  Here's something from the red state bragging about the fact
[03:39:12.526 --> 03:39:16.992]  That Cruz is stealing delegates in North Carolina, where I came from.
[03:39:17.844 --> 03:39:20.765]  North Carolina delegate disaster brewing for Donald Trump.
[03:39:20.805 --> 03:39:23.485]  John Kasich leads Donald Trump in delegates.
[03:39:23.565 --> 03:39:24.065]  How about that?
[03:39:24.125 --> 03:39:24.785]  How did that work out?
[03:39:24.805 --> 03:39:33.727]  Well, you know, when they actually had an election there, Donald Trump got 40% of the vote, Ted Cruz got 37% of the vote, John Kasich got 13.
[03:39:34.307 --> 03:39:42.748]  But John Kasich gets two delegates, Donald Trump gets one delegate, and Cruz gets 21 delegates.
[03:39:43.249 --> 03:39:44.369]  That's out of the 24 delegates
[03:39:46.243 --> 03:39:46.483]  That's right.
[03:40:08.749 --> 03:40:10.090]  Cruz is going in and getting most of them.
[03:40:10.370 --> 03:40:17.856]  Cruz has gotten out of the 24 or the 39 that have already been selected, Cruz has gotten 88% of those, even though he only got 37% of the vote.
[03:40:18.657 --> 03:40:23.300]  Trump has gotten only 4% of those, even though he got 40% of your vote.
[03:40:23.741 --> 03:40:26.103]  Now, I'm angry about this.
[03:40:27.464 --> 03:40:29.225]  Not because I'm a Trump supporter.
[03:40:30.006 --> 03:40:31.327]  I'm angry about the corruption.
[03:40:31.687 --> 03:40:34.729]  Because, you know, I'm angry to see this happening on the Democrat side as well.
[03:40:35.810 --> 03:40:36.711]  We look at Wisconsin.
[03:40:38.151 --> 03:40:40.592]  Different candidate, different party.
[03:40:41.052 --> 03:40:42.172]  I don't support Bernie.
[03:40:42.312 --> 03:40:43.253]  He's a socialist.
[03:40:43.333 --> 03:40:44.393]  I don't like socialists.
[03:40:44.413 --> 03:40:48.374]  I've called him Bernie Sandernista because he loved the Nicaraguan socialism.
[03:40:49.075 --> 03:40:51.916]  That kleptocracy, if you want to call it that, is really what it was.
[03:40:52.816 --> 03:40:54.436]  So I would never vote for Bernie.
[03:40:54.676 --> 03:40:55.637]  I don't support Bernie.
[03:40:56.735 --> 03:41:01.077]  But I don't like to see the election run like a mafia system.
[03:41:01.117 --> 03:41:02.737]  This is racketeering, folks.
[03:41:03.038 --> 03:41:03.898]  It's racketeering.
[03:41:04.358 --> 03:41:15.002]  When he goes to a different state, different party, different individual, somebody I don't support, in Wyoming, he got 27% more of the vote than Hillary Clinton did.
[03:41:15.022 --> 03:41:15.983]  He beat her by 12 points.
[03:41:16.043 --> 03:41:16.723]  He got 27% more of the vote.
[03:41:16.743 --> 03:41:17.003]  Guess what?
[03:41:17.023 --> 03:41:18.144]  She got 57% more of the delegates.
[03:41:21.943 --> 03:41:25.846]  So he beats her by 30% in the popular vote, she gets 60% more delegates.
[03:41:26.746 --> 03:41:29.028]  That's the corrupt system that we have in this country.
[03:41:29.768 --> 03:41:31.450]  And that's both of the parties.
[03:41:31.730 --> 03:41:34.151]  Which really is a single party.
[03:41:35.029 --> 03:41:40.133]  And let me go back to this North Carolina story, because this is the way they're bragging about it on Red State.
[03:41:40.533 --> 03:41:46.278]  They said the Donald Trump campaign is raising incompetence to previously unseen heights.
[03:41:46.338 --> 03:41:51.902]  His idea was that he goes out, gives speeches to big rallies, and then gets the nomination.
[03:41:53.003 --> 03:41:54.945]  Well, they left out an important step there, didn't they?
[03:41:55.645 --> 03:42:00.329]  There's an election in between the big speeches and big rallies and the nomination.
[03:42:01.766 --> 03:42:06.150]  There's an election that goes there, and they left that out of their little, snotty comment.
[03:42:07.331 --> 03:42:09.894]  That's what's missing from the red state narrative.
[03:42:10.434 --> 03:42:10.955]  Voters.
[03:42:11.375 --> 03:42:11.776]  Voters.
[03:42:12.496 --> 03:42:14.378]  You're the ones they're stealing this from.
[03:42:14.699 --> 03:42:16.240]  They're not stealing it from Bernie.
[03:42:16.520 --> 03:42:18.102]  They're not stealing it from Trump.
[03:42:18.362 --> 03:42:19.984]  They're stealing it from you.
[03:42:20.744 --> 03:42:21.585]  They're stealing it from you.
[03:42:22.486 --> 03:42:24.826]  These racketeers are stealing it from you.
[03:42:24.886 --> 03:42:31.388]  These Republican Democrats, the Demo-Publicans, the Republicrats, whatever you want to call them, they're stealing it from you.
[03:42:31.768 --> 03:42:41.669]  They're saying, we can only have two parties, we're it, we'll decide who gets on the ballot, we'll set up all kinds of obstacles for third parties and independents, but for us, we're automatically on the ballot.
[03:42:42.009 --> 03:42:49.211]  I mean, even when they don't turn their paperwork in, like John Kasich in Pennsylvania didn't turn in, he had to turn in 2,000 signatures that were verified.
[03:42:49.271 --> 03:42:50.211]  He didn't meet that.
[03:42:50.911 --> 03:42:52.952]  And they said, that's alright, we'll let him on the ballot anyway.
[03:42:53.012 --> 03:42:54.912]  They would never do that to a third party.
[03:42:54.932 --> 03:42:56.733]  They would never do that to an independent candidate.
[03:42:56.753 --> 03:42:57.753]  They waive the rules.
[03:42:57.793 --> 03:43:01.794]  They waive the rules for Bernie and Hillary because the Democrat Party didn't do the paperwork on time.
[03:43:02.234 --> 03:43:02.895]  Why bother?
[03:43:03.095 --> 03:43:04.095]  It doesn't really matter.
[03:43:04.495 --> 03:43:05.535]  The rules are for other people.
[03:43:05.555 --> 03:43:06.236]  They're not for us.
[03:43:07.056 --> 03:43:09.516]  It's the same thing you see happening with the emails.
[03:43:09.536 --> 03:43:10.997]  You know, we just had Obama come out and say,
[03:43:12.506 --> 03:43:15.248]  Well, there's top secret, and then there's top secret.
[03:43:16.909 --> 03:43:19.751]  And it's like, yeah, yeah, okay.
[03:43:19.771 --> 03:43:21.752]  Whatever the meaning of is, is, okay?
[03:43:22.492 --> 03:43:25.734]  Yeah, there's rules for her, and then there's rules for the rest of you.
[03:43:26.275 --> 03:43:35.501]  And we have set up this national security state that we worship and we sacrifice all of our freedoms and our rule of law and the Constitution on the altar of this national security state
[03:43:36.101 --> 03:43:48.261]  But when she openly shows contempt for it and violates it and exposes all of the stuff that is above top secret, things that were born secret, confidential conversations between her and other heads of state,
[03:43:49.261 --> 03:44:01.406]  When all this stuff that we're supposed to believe is vital to our safety, vital to our security, when all that's just put out on an open server or private server because it suits her to do that, she's given a free pass.
[03:44:01.966 --> 03:44:04.647]  And you know, there's secret and then there's secret.
[03:44:04.667 --> 03:44:08.949]  You know, there's Hillary's secrets and then there's national security secrets.
[03:44:08.989 --> 03:44:12.291]  And her secrets are more important and she is too big to jail.
[03:44:13.231 --> 03:44:13.952]  So that's what we're seeing.
[03:44:14.252 --> 03:44:15.493]  We're seeing the double standard here.
[03:44:15.893 --> 03:44:22.717]  We're seeing the fact that it's the voters, not Donald Trump, not Bernie Sanders, that are being cheated here.
[03:44:23.518 --> 03:44:29.782]  When I look at this New York Times article, they say, you know, as the campaigns seek delegates, ordinary voters are feeling sidelined.
[03:44:29.802 --> 03:44:32.504]  It's like, yeah, you know, don't feel like you're being left out.
[03:44:32.524 --> 03:44:34.005]  Please, we don't want to hurt your feelings.
[03:44:34.045 --> 03:44:36.927]  We want you to just understand this is a private club.
[03:44:36.947 --> 03:44:39.769]  See, when they want it to be a private club, it's a private club.
[03:44:40.998 --> 03:44:44.381]  When they want it to be the government, then it's the government.
[03:44:44.421 --> 03:44:57.274]  When they come in and say, well, you know, we're going to decide what's in the people's interest, and we're going to take over the debate process, and we're not going to let anybody into the presidential debates unless they're 15% in the polls, because, you know, that'd just be too confusing to have too many candidates up on the stage.
[03:44:58.375 --> 03:45:03.297]  Like all the Republican and Democrat debates that we covered for the last six months.
[03:45:03.377 --> 03:45:05.417]  Okay, we can't have more than two candidates on the stage.
[03:45:05.617 --> 03:45:05.878]  Right.
[03:45:06.438 --> 03:45:09.099]  And we can't have anybody that's got less than 15% support.
[03:45:09.239 --> 03:45:09.499]  Right.
[03:45:09.999 --> 03:45:10.259]  Okay.
[03:45:10.739 --> 03:45:10.999]  Okay.
[03:45:11.539 --> 03:45:12.500]  It'd just be too confusing.
[03:45:12.780 --> 03:45:14.340]  No, they did that after Ross Perot got in.
[03:45:14.380 --> 03:45:15.901]  They didn't ever want that to happen again.
[03:45:16.241 --> 03:45:18.342]  So they set it up so they don't let anybody in there.
[03:45:18.662 --> 03:45:20.702]  But see, they're just a private party.
[03:45:20.742 --> 03:45:21.963]  It's just a private club.
[03:45:22.923 --> 03:45:23.603]  It's their party.
[03:45:24.143 --> 03:45:25.404]  They can do whatever they want to.
[03:45:26.277 --> 03:45:28.160]  You know, it's a club, and like Carlin says, you're not in it.
[03:45:28.560 --> 03:45:40.437]  And they go on to say in the New York Times, if supporters of Trump and Sanders feel stymied by the delegation process, that's because it was designed years ago precisely to make it difficult for candidates like them to become the nominee.
[03:45:41.209 --> 03:45:41.930]  So, there you go.
[03:45:42.530 --> 03:45:49.795]  Yeah, it was designed to be corrupt and calcified and to shut out anybody who comes in with any new ideas.
[03:45:49.835 --> 03:45:55.018]  And we're going to ask the same questions from the mainstream media at all the debates that we ask at all the debates.
[03:45:55.819 --> 03:45:59.861]  They don't change it from year, from election season to election season.
[03:45:59.881 --> 03:46:01.963]  They will get the same questions we got four years ago.
[03:46:02.303 --> 03:46:06.065]  Not only that, but within the election they don't change from week to week.
[03:46:07.025 --> 03:46:12.671]  Whether it's CNN or whether it's Fox News, it's the same questions on the same narrow band of issues.
[03:46:13.852 --> 03:46:20.759]  You know, you would think that they would even talk to them about pot legalization or something, because that's got a lot of different aspects to it.
[03:46:21.359 --> 03:46:26.665]  It's happening, it's breaking out, it's a state's rights versus a federal government issue.
[03:46:28.486 --> 03:46:31.267]  There's a lot of things I could talk about, but they don't even want to bring that up.
[03:46:31.347 --> 03:46:32.247]  They don't want to talk about that.
[03:46:32.307 --> 03:46:35.549]  And then the New York Times goes on and says, well, like any private members-only club.
[03:46:35.569 --> 03:46:36.909]  See, it's a private members-only club.
[03:46:37.489 --> 03:46:40.991]  Political parties are not official government entities, except when they want to be.
[03:46:42.611 --> 03:46:45.032]  They want to tell us that as businesses we don't have any rights.
[03:46:45.292 --> 03:46:48.713]  We don't even have religious rights in businesses because you're open to the public.
[03:46:48.993 --> 03:46:55.956]  And yet these are people who are running elections that are subsidized by the taxpayers, but no, they're a private party, members only.
[03:46:56.749 --> 03:46:59.751]  They're trying to join us, as Reince Priebus says, okay?
[03:47:00.271 --> 03:47:09.678]  Party leaders exercise, according to the New York Times, considerable control over which candidate gets their endorsement and the attendant privilege of using their political infrastructure.
[03:47:09.698 --> 03:47:11.019]  You want to get upset about privilege?
[03:47:11.499 --> 03:47:13.280]  You want to talk about white privilege?
[03:47:14.001 --> 03:47:15.742]  Let's talk about political privilege.
[03:47:15.922 --> 03:47:18.104]  Let's talk about crony socialism.
[03:47:19.554 --> 03:47:21.255]  That's the real political privilege.
[03:47:21.515 --> 03:47:25.396]  And let's take a look, because everybody went, oh yeah, just a Trump supporter, whatever.
[03:47:25.937 --> 03:47:28.057]  Let's take a look at what they're saying on the Democrat side.
[03:47:28.678 --> 03:47:29.738]  Let's play this clip.
[03:47:29.758 --> 03:47:36.321]  You guys got this clip set up about Sanders wants to rig the system with superdelegates, says Hillary Clinton.
[03:47:36.361 --> 03:47:37.161]  Let's play that clip.
[03:47:37.901 --> 03:47:39.222]  Is the system rigged in that way?
[03:47:39.787 --> 03:47:44.169]  And really, I think when you talk about rigging the system, that's what Senator Sanders is trying to do now.
[03:47:44.229 --> 03:47:47.551]  Hillary Clinton has won in the popular vote by a wide margin.
[03:47:47.571 --> 03:47:52.933]  She's got more than 2 million votes over Senator Sanders in all the contests when you add them all up.
[03:47:53.313 --> 03:47:54.234]  She's won more states.
[03:47:54.454 --> 03:47:55.814]  She's won more pledged delegates.
[03:47:55.995 --> 03:48:05.539]  So now that's forcing Senator Sanders to go out and talk about the idea that he wants to try to flip superdelegates and get him to overturn the will of the people as expressed through who's won the most contests.
[03:48:06.075 --> 03:48:06.656]  Well, yeah.
[03:48:06.956 --> 03:48:08.017]  Well, that would be the will of the people.
[03:48:08.217 --> 03:48:11.600]  See, she started out 15% ahead with all these superdelegates.
[03:48:11.640 --> 03:48:17.545]  The superdelegates said in New York when they were asked by the New York paper, well, what if Bernie were to win the popular vote?
[03:48:17.565 --> 03:48:18.946]  Would you still vote for Hillary Clinton?
[03:48:19.166 --> 03:48:19.747]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:48:19.947 --> 03:48:22.169]  There's nothing that could keep me from voting for Hillary Clinton.
[03:48:22.349 --> 03:48:23.410]  I make that decision.
[03:48:23.570 --> 03:48:24.831]  I'm a party of one.
[03:48:25.231 --> 03:48:25.531]  Okay?
[03:48:25.651 --> 03:48:27.553]  I'm not going to pay any attention to the voters.
[03:48:27.633 --> 03:48:29.154]  I care less about the voters.
[03:48:30.415 --> 03:48:35.817]  And clearly, I think she would have a case if he basically flipped all... Get rid of the superdelegates!
[03:48:35.897 --> 03:48:37.957]  Instead of people saying, well, I need the superdelegates.
[03:48:37.997 --> 03:48:39.178]  No, you need the superdelegates.
[03:48:39.938 --> 03:48:40.398]  Get rid of them.
[03:48:41.198 --> 03:48:41.939]  Have the people vote.
[03:48:42.559 --> 03:48:44.579]  Make it a proportional election if you want to.
[03:48:44.619 --> 03:48:45.700]  Get rid of the winner-take-all.
[03:48:45.740 --> 03:48:47.480]  But, you know, let's at least do that.
[03:48:47.520 --> 03:48:51.521]  And then, of course, we need to clean up the election so they can't rig all this stuff with their phony voting machines.
[03:48:51.881 --> 03:48:52.762]  That's the other part of the issue.
[03:48:54.468 --> 03:48:55.849]  They come back and they say this.
[03:48:56.269 --> 03:48:57.410]  Let's play this other clip.
[03:48:57.430 --> 03:49:00.552]  The Democrat primary process was rigged to favor Hillary Clinton.
[03:49:00.592 --> 03:49:02.093]  Here's the other side of the issue.
[03:49:02.333 --> 03:49:07.997]  The Democrats have set up this race in a way that favors the person who establishes a large lead from the outset.
[03:49:08.517 --> 03:49:13.480]  And it's hard to, when you're playing on those kind of rules, it's hard to climb out of a hole.
[03:49:14.561 --> 03:49:18.243]  Because even if you win, if you don't win overwhelmingly, it's not enough.
[03:49:18.263 --> 03:49:22.466]  And we saw that just yesterday, where he wins in Wyoming, a great state for him, and they split that
[03:49:23.188 --> 03:49:29.422]  Basically, his team thinks, okay, maybe we come close in New York, or we win by a little bit, then they move into these north...
[03:49:30.782 --> 03:49:31.963]  ...they don't think they have a chance for.
[03:49:32.243 --> 03:49:36.005]  They're looking for when the race moves back out west to Oregon, to California.
[03:49:36.025 --> 03:49:43.109]  They hope they can rack up big wins there and then make the case that he's more electable than her in a general election and have all these superdelegates switch sides.
[03:49:43.529 --> 03:49:52.374]  It's just hard to see that playing out given the institutional-like biases built into the process towards the person who, as you point out, establishes a big lead.
[03:49:53.621 --> 03:50:01.950]  Yeah, and of course I talked about that last night, and I talked about it because I think really the corruption in the Republican Party is even more in your face.
[03:50:02.511 --> 03:50:10.059]  Because it just keeps saying, hey, we're not cheating, we're winning, we're proud of what we're doing, it's a private party, they're trying to join us, and we're happy with this process.
[03:50:10.920 --> 03:50:12.942]  I reported on that last night, you can find that video.
[03:50:14.707 --> 03:50:16.308]  RINOs go RICO.
[03:50:16.768 --> 03:50:18.629]  Because understand, they're not really Republicans.
[03:50:18.649 --> 03:50:22.051]  You've got one political party, and it's a globalist, multinational party.
[03:50:22.091 --> 03:50:23.851]  That's the people at the top who are running this thing.
[03:50:23.871 --> 03:50:35.917]  And even though you've got honest people, you've got some people within the party structure, even people who are elected officials, the people who really control the situation is a one-party, globalist system.
[03:50:36.758 --> 03:50:41.640]  One of the ways that they get through this, of course, I want to go back, I forgot to talk about this when I was talking about the issues.
[03:50:42.836 --> 03:50:49.957]  I compared Ted Cruz on Obamacare and Donald Trump, but it's the way they talk about it.
[03:50:50.540 --> 03:50:54.662]  You know, everybody is attacking Donald Trump on waterboarding as torture.
[03:50:55.182 --> 03:50:57.744]  And he's, I think, foolishly jumping into it.
[03:50:58.384 --> 03:51:01.165]  Ted Cruz does it in a much more nuanced way.
[03:51:01.205 --> 03:51:02.786]  When we come back, I'll tell you how he does that.
[03:51:03.246 --> 03:51:06.348]  The secrets of a lying, cheating lawyer.
[03:51:06.408 --> 03:51:07.648]  This is the way they do it, folks.
[03:51:07.688 --> 03:51:10.050]  Where there's natural-born citizen, there's torture.
[03:51:10.890 --> 03:51:18.374]  It was George Berkeley that famously said, if a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it make a sound, did it make a sound?
[03:51:19.224 --> 03:51:21.686]  Well, I'm here to give you the answer to that age-old question.
[03:51:21.906 --> 03:51:22.686]  Yes, it did.
[03:51:28.490 --> 03:51:37.255]  And if the American Republic had fallen, and no one in the mainstream media told you, would the Republic still be dead?
[03:51:37.936 --> 03:51:38.756]  And the answer is yes.
[03:51:42.579 --> 03:51:46.962]  In 20-plus years on air, I've never seen a demarcation line that clearly shows to me
[03:51:48.061 --> 03:51:58.412]  The full collapse has basically already gone to a point where you can say this country is unrecognizable and we are rapidly accelerating into a nightmare totalitarian system.
[03:51:59.574 --> 03:52:09.024]  We've seen Priebus, the head of the Republican Party, we've seen the head of the Rules Committee, Curly Hewlin or whatever his name is, come out and openly say, listen,
[03:52:10.782 --> 03:52:11.563]  The media's wrong.
[03:52:11.583 --> 03:52:12.604]  You never had a vote.
[03:52:12.724 --> 03:52:13.425]  It doesn't count.
[03:52:13.465 --> 03:52:14.726]  The party picks whoever's there.
[03:52:15.086 --> 03:52:16.688]  You're just here at a fashion contest.
[03:52:16.988 --> 03:52:19.671]  Political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[03:52:20.631 --> 03:52:22.073]  Contrary to popular belief.
[03:52:22.553 --> 03:52:24.035]  Then why are they holding the primaries?
[03:52:25.049 --> 03:52:26.350]  That's a very good question.
[03:52:26.390 --> 03:52:41.278]  Then when myself and Roger Stone and others came out and simply called for people to go protest and demonstrate and talk to the delegates, and we said, and don't be violent, in Cleveland coming up in a few months, they had all their pundits go on TV and say, maybe Roger Stone should be arrested.
[03:52:41.398 --> 03:52:45.460]  This is in a climate with all these incredible attacks on free speech, and it's really creepy.
[03:52:45.860 --> 03:52:47.381]  We are a free society in America.
[03:52:47.401 --> 03:52:48.601]  We're not a third world country.
[03:52:48.881 --> 03:52:50.662]  We don't threaten violence against delegates.
[03:52:50.682 --> 03:52:58.665]  And I think that rights previous in the RNC should move to ban Roger Stone from the convention because we cannot tolerate threats and threats of violence.
[03:52:59.045 --> 03:53:02.226]  They're also stealing states and delegates from Bernie Sanders.
[03:53:02.587 --> 03:53:05.888]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're telling you that they're allowed to make these rules.
[03:53:06.468 --> 03:53:14.673]  But they're taking public taxpayer money by the billions, and the counties and cities are holding out that we're having public elections where it's one person, one vote.
[03:53:15.113 --> 03:53:22.377]  There are federal and state election laws, like the 1965 Voting Rights Act, that's meant to block this type of racketeering.
[03:53:23.138 --> 03:53:29.381]  Even Jim Crow laws against poor blacks and whites were not this strict or this over the top.
[03:53:29.841 --> 03:53:31.743]  And I'll close with the words of President JFK.
[03:53:32.603 --> 03:53:37.725]  Those that make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.
[03:53:38.446 --> 03:53:44.388]  And the power brokers know that and they want to break our will and push forward and want a civil war in this country.
[03:53:44.908 --> 03:53:46.029]  Let's peacefully go out.
[03:53:46.549 --> 03:53:47.589]  Let's sue these people.
[03:53:48.190 --> 03:53:49.750]  Let's donate to political causes.
[03:53:49.790 --> 03:53:50.751]  Let's get involved.
[03:53:51.171 --> 03:53:52.732]  Let's have our minds heard.
[03:53:53.112 --> 03:53:54.913]  Let's expose these political party machines.
[03:53:54.933 --> 03:53:57.854]  Let's do everything we can to stop this illegal
[03:53:58.354 --> 03:54:01.598]  As George Carlin said, it's a big club and you ain't in it.
[03:54:16.970 --> 03:54:18.090]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:18.110 --> 03:54:21.991]  In this last segment, I want to tell you how Ted Cruz gets away with this.
[03:54:22.011 --> 03:54:25.092]  I want to give you a preview of what's happening tonight on the nightly news.
[03:54:25.412 --> 03:54:30.134]  Before I do, real quickly, we have Supermail Vitality back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:54:30.614 --> 03:54:35.775]  We know our bodies are under hormonal attack from estrogen mimickers in the food and water supply.
[03:54:35.795 --> 03:54:37.396]  We've documented this many times.
[03:54:37.416 --> 03:54:42.097]  You can see this with the fish, with the shrimp in the water, how the chemicals
[03:54:42.697 --> 03:54:51.205]  That are washing out of our systems that we're flushing down our toilets that are coming out of our urine and being put into the system are actually affecting
[03:54:51.986 --> 03:54:53.788]  Sex changes in the shrimp.
[03:54:53.868 --> 03:54:54.949]  Yeah, it's not just us.
[03:54:55.450 --> 03:54:56.751]  Many people are talking about this.
[03:54:57.191 --> 03:54:57.952]  How do you fight this?
[03:54:58.553 --> 03:55:02.236]  Well, one of the things you can do is you can take something like Super Male Vitality.
[03:55:02.577 --> 03:55:08.082]  It helps to sort out and protect against this hormonal attack in your system.
[03:55:08.503 --> 03:55:11.205]  Super Male Vitality has hundreds of five-star reviews.
[03:55:11.245 --> 03:55:12.166]  Zinfowarslife.com.
[03:55:13.107 --> 03:55:16.928]  Take a look at these interviews, see these reviews, see what people have said about this.
[03:55:16.988 --> 03:55:18.849]  It's something that I use on a regular basis.
[03:55:19.329 --> 03:55:28.172]  It is something that is formulated to help you to fight these estrogen mimickers that you find in the food and in the water supply.
[03:55:28.212 --> 03:55:30.953]  And right now it is in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:55:30.973 --> 03:55:35.815]  Check out, read the hundreds of five-star reviews that you'll find at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:55:37.472 --> 03:55:52.644]  Now, just before we went to the break, I said I was going to tell you about how Ted Cruz spins the issue, but it's really one of the reasons why, even though I disagree with Donald Trump on many issues, I feel more comfortable with him than somebody like Ted Cruz, who will tell me what I want to hear, sometimes.
[03:55:52.664 --> 03:55:55.006]  And then he'll go tell somebody else what they want to hear.
[03:55:55.046 --> 03:55:56.027]  Here's a good example of this.
[03:55:56.427 --> 03:55:59.870]  When they had the debates before New Hampshire, and they were talking about waterboarding,
[03:56:00.461 --> 03:56:00.722]  Okay?
[03:56:01.143 --> 03:56:02.345]  Donald Trump says, yeah, I'm all for it.
[03:56:02.365 --> 03:56:02.927]  Let's bring it back.
[03:56:03.007 --> 03:56:03.728]  No, I disagree.
[03:56:03.869 --> 03:56:04.951]  And we've said that many times.
[03:56:05.412 --> 03:56:06.695]  Ted Cruz, however, says this.
[03:56:06.715 --> 03:56:08.198]  He says, torture is wrong.
[03:56:08.799 --> 03:56:09.902]  Unambiguously wrong.
[03:56:09.962 --> 03:56:10.343]  Period.
[03:56:10.403 --> 03:56:10.824]  The end.
[03:56:11.803 --> 03:56:19.991]  But then the guy who was with the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel during the Bush administration, who opposed waterboarding, said, well, you know, it's interesting.
[03:56:20.332 --> 03:56:24.836]  He says he opposes torture, but he doesn't say what constitutes torture.
[03:56:24.956 --> 03:56:25.337]  Guess what?
[03:56:25.477 --> 03:56:29.781]  It took about two weeks for Ted Cruz to come out and say, well, you know what?
[03:56:29.942 --> 03:56:31.043]  Waterboarding isn't torture.
[03:56:31.980 --> 03:56:34.582]  That was the whole thing they were talking about during the debate.
[03:56:35.222 --> 03:56:37.684]  That's the way he deceives people.
[03:56:38.504 --> 03:56:39.645]  He shuts down the debate.
[03:56:39.745 --> 03:56:40.966]  He shuts down the discussion.
[03:56:41.166 --> 03:56:42.567]  He makes people feel secure.
[03:56:42.587 --> 03:56:44.468]  He makes them feel like he's on their side.
[03:56:44.488 --> 03:56:53.954]  Remember, this is the guy who has used data mining to create personalized appeals to individual voters as they go door-to-door, as his volunteers go door-to-door.
[03:56:54.134 --> 03:56:56.535]  He will tell you precisely what you want to hear.
[03:56:57.216 --> 03:56:59.037]  And then who knows what this guy will do.
[03:56:59.773 --> 03:57:03.554]  Now they're talking about Paul Ryan as... We don't know what he's doing.
[03:57:03.594 --> 03:57:05.474]  He's going around, he's campaigning for something.
[03:57:06.074 --> 03:57:08.695]  Maybe it's this time, maybe it's four years from now, we really don't know.
[03:57:09.455 --> 03:57:19.117]  But I want you to consider the guy that is now being looked at, the guy who was the longest-serving Republican Speaker of the House in history, Dennis Hastert.
[03:57:19.137 --> 03:57:21.057]  There's a lot of news about Dennis Hastert.
[03:57:21.657 --> 03:57:25.318]  You think that they won't put corrupt people in office?
[03:57:26.277 --> 03:57:27.518]  You know, when you look at this D.C.
[03:57:27.558 --> 03:57:28.919]  Madam stuff, I had the D.C.
[03:57:29.259 --> 03:57:32.002]  Madam's lawyer on last Friday.
[03:57:33.418 --> 03:57:37.140]  It was Montgomery Blair Sibley, and he said, hey, I've got a lot of information on people.
[03:57:37.160 --> 03:57:38.380]  This is crucial to the election.
[03:57:38.660 --> 03:57:41.261]  Voters need to have this information before they make their decisions.
[03:57:41.861 --> 03:57:43.562]  He said he was going to release some stuff this week.
[03:57:43.602 --> 03:57:48.584]  He's been blocked from releasing individual names, but he says, hey, there's somebody on there you need to know about.
[03:57:49.224 --> 03:57:53.866]  And he said other people who have looked at this as well, we know that it isn't names on the list or not.
[03:57:54.466 --> 03:57:58.168]  Trump, Kasich, Hillary Clinton, you know, Bernie Sanders.
[03:57:58.568 --> 03:57:58.828]  Anyway.
[03:57:59.528 --> 03:58:06.833]  He did release some of the institutions that were involved in this, and these would be people who are high up in these institutions, because he's not going to know who the lower level employees are.
[03:58:07.334 --> 03:58:15.139]  FBI, IRS, State Department, Department of Commerce, the Embassy of Japan, Lockheed Martin, Price, Waterhouse, Coopers, all those people were in there.
[03:58:15.179 --> 03:58:16.540]  We've got Dennis Hastert.
[03:58:17.781 --> 03:58:23.306]  And he is now, it was first three, then four, then five people that he had abused.
[03:58:23.327 --> 03:58:25.488]  Of course, they let the statute of limitations run out on that.
[03:58:25.529 --> 03:58:26.149]  They shouldn't have.
[03:58:26.169 --> 03:58:27.751]  There shouldn't be any statute of limitations of that.
[03:58:28.151 --> 03:58:30.093]  So they're coming at him with other charges.
[03:58:30.133 --> 03:58:34.517]  We got comedian Andy Richter, who works with Conan O'Brien, says, yeah, I went to that school.
[03:58:34.557 --> 03:58:35.758]  I remember he used to set up
[03:58:36.218 --> 03:58:37.720]  You are listening to GCN.

[03:59:09.626 --> 03:59:17.849]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:59:18.029 --> 03:59:22.690]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[03:59:29.693 --> 03:59:36.775]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:59:36.875 --> 03:59:43.758]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:59:43.898 --> 03:59:48.240]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:59:48.380 --> 03:59:51.601]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
