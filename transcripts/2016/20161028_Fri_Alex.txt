[00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:35.376]  Every expert, regardless of political party, regardless of ideology, conservative or liberal, who has ever examined these issues in a serious way will tell you that instances of significant voter fraud are not to be found.
[00:00:36.256 --> 00:00:47.764]  The very election fraud President Obama would have us all ignore, like the sheep he perceives us all to be, has, as predicted, reared its ugly head all over the United States.
[00:00:48.045 --> 00:01:00.053]  In Texas, the issue was actually discovered on Monday morning when Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne was casting her own ballot and the voter next to her noticed that one of her votes was not filled in.
[00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:16.498]  When she reviewed her electronic ballot, Hawthorne told 12 News on Tuesday, an error in the voting machine programming by Election Systems and Software, ES&S, caused votes for one statewide court of appeals race not to be entered.
[00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:22.963]  When a voter tried to vote straight ticket in either party, according to a release from Chambers County.
[00:01:23.223 --> 00:01:29.808]  Election Systems and Software was founded in 1979 and is owned by the McCarthy Group.
[00:01:29.908 --> 00:01:40.296]  Back in 2010, the Washington Post reported ES&S was the target of a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice in 2010 due to a shady contract deal.
[00:01:40.416 --> 00:01:43.458]  And after that deal, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg
[00:01:43.638 --> 00:02:06.304]  Referred to the breakdown of the machines as a royal screw-up, ES&S is based in Omaha, Nebraska, the home of operations for globalist Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Wall Street, Hillary's supporter, and one of the main focuses of John DeCamp's The Franklin Cover-Up, an investigation of a corporacratic pedophile society that went all the way to the White House.
[00:02:06.724 --> 00:02:14.448]  Ironically, Buffett recently asked the question, Mr. Trump, have you no sense of decency, sir?
[00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:23.934]  In 2014, Election Systems and Software was the largest manufacturer of voting machines in the United States, claiming customers in 4,500 localities in 42 states and two U.S.
[00:02:23.954 --> 00:02:24.314]  territories.
[00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:42.860]  And if those machines aren't bad enough, as Polizet reported, the George Soros-linked UK company Smartmatic provided voting machines for 16 states, including important battleground states like Florida and Arizona.
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.401]  Since the story first broke, the float
[00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:59.251]  The show chart has disappeared from Smartmatic's website, detailing its reach into the United States, raising further questions about the real status of the Soros Tide voting equipment and whether it is truly being deployed in U.S.
[00:02:59.331 --> 00:02:59.871]  elections.
[00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:09.078]  A petition begging Congress to have an emergency meeting session to remove the Soros-linked machines has already passed its required 100,000 signatures.
[00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:24.666]  Smartmatic has since doubled down on the debunking of Soros having any link to their organization by publishing on their website that George Soros does not have and has never had any ownership stake in Smartmatic.
[00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:39.653]  But then Smartmatic goes on to say, it is no secret that our chairman, Lord Mark Malik Brown, is a member of a number of non-profit boards, including the global board of the Open Society Foundation, Soros' foundation.
[00:03:39.793 --> 00:03:51.744]  Lord Malik Brown is a highly respected global figure whose credentials include former Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations and former Vice Chairman of the World Economic Forum.
[00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:53.605]  It's real simple.
[00:03:53.926 --> 00:04:01.933]  Why in the darkest caverns of Hades is an English Lord on the board with Soros' Open Society Foundation
[00:04:02.293 --> 00:04:14.707]  Sporting a mile-long globalist resume, overseeing the United States voting process in 16 states, Indiana revealed it had 4,556 double registrations, 3,000 records without birthdates, and 31 registered voters too young to vote.
[00:04:21.274 --> 00:04:40.511]  The FBI is currently investigating 19 dead Virginians re-registered to vote in Harrisonburg, Virginia, while a 2012 Pew study revealed that 1.8 million deceased individuals were listed as voters and that 2.75 million are registered in more than one state.
[00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:44.514]  And according to the Brennan Center for Justice, vendors are frequently
[00:04:44.554 --> 00:04:48.517]  And we now have video of it actually happening all over the country, flipping the votes.
[00:04:48.537 --> 00:04:48.978]  Stay with us.
[00:05:12.113 --> 00:05:15.695]  Here's complete garbage from Caroline Winter at Bloomberg.com.
[00:05:15.935 --> 00:05:16.395]  Headline!
[00:05:16.555 --> 00:05:21.098]  Some cities want their immigrants to vote, but Caroline forgot a very important word in that headline.
[00:05:21.318 --> 00:05:21.878]  Illegal!
[00:05:22.078 --> 00:05:29.282]  San Francisco is the latest city to consider taking votes from non-citizens, people with a green card, visas, or no documentation at all.
[00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:30.322]  Got an ID?
[00:05:30.542 --> 00:05:30.762]  No.
[00:05:30.943 --> 00:05:31.623]  Got a green card?
[00:05:31.883 --> 00:05:32.043]  No.
[00:05:32.363 --> 00:05:32.964]  Got a visa?
[00:05:33.224 --> 00:05:33.384]  No.
[00:05:33.704 --> 00:05:34.364]  Are you a citizen?
[00:05:34.604 --> 00:05:34.804]  No.
[00:05:35.165 --> 00:05:36.025]  Okay, here's your ballot.
[00:05:36.385 --> 00:05:46.770]  They claim Russia is rigging or may interfere with the election through hacking, but if Russia really wanted to interfere, they would just fly millions of people over here to vote Donald Trump in battleground states.
[00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.092]  They'd have operatives inside voting hundreds of times for Trump.
[00:05:50.512 --> 00:05:51.932]  No hacking necessary.
[00:05:52.413 --> 00:05:59.356]  So now, anyone in the world can come here, get a free handout from the American taxpayers, and also vote in our elections.
[00:05:59.736 --> 00:06:03.801]  In that same story, Caroline Winter said there is no evidence of voter fraud.
[00:06:04.242 --> 00:06:06.805]  This is Owen Schroer from InfoWars.com.
[00:06:11.278 --> 00:06:21.821]  If you ever wanted to live off the grid and produce your own clean energy in a silent, reliable way, this is a message you want to pay very close attention to.
[00:06:22.141 --> 00:06:32.783]  Thanks to a new development in solar generator technology, it's now possible for my listeners and viewers to produce their own source of emergency backup electricity.
[00:06:33.203 --> 00:06:36.164]  And even more importantly, it's now extremely affordable.
[00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:43.330]  Thanks to the guys at Solutions for Science, you can get one of these $6,000 solar generators for less than $1,500.
[00:06:44.972 --> 00:06:47.314]  We have these units at the office and at my home.
[00:06:47.674 --> 00:06:53.059]  I can run my sump pumps, my shortwave radios, all of my devices, and even keep our food from spoiling.

[00:06:58.644 --> 00:07:02.348]  Folks, there has never been a better time to get off the grid.
[00:07:02.728 --> 00:07:07.030]  It's going to be crucial in 2017, maybe even life-saving.

[00:07:15.953 --> 00:07:18.134]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:07:18.234 --> 00:07:25.036]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:07:25.276 --> 00:07:28.537]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:07:28.557 --> 00:07:29.737]  You're going to crash afterwards.
[00:07:30.037 --> 00:07:36.439]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:07:36.679 --> 00:07:37.500]  This is sustainable.
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.601]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:07:41.801 --> 00:07:44.982]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:07:45.042 --> 00:07:48.043]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:07:48.183 --> 00:07:49.584]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:07:49.624 --> 00:07:55.329]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:07:55.369 --> 00:08:00.513]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com.
[00:08:00.734 --> 00:08:01.354]  Or call 888-253-3139.

[00:08:04.116 --> 00:08:05.257]  And we thank you for your support.
[00:08:15.883 --> 00:08:18.665]  It's Friday, the 28th day of October 2016.
[00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:25.428]  We are now on the final countdown to the midterm general election.
[00:08:27.429 --> 00:08:31.131]  Donald Trump is the tip of the spear for nationalism worldwide.
[00:08:32.032 --> 00:08:35.774]  We are 10 days and counting down to the general election.
[00:08:37.294 --> 00:08:43.778]  But first we must interrupt your regularly scheduled programming for this most important of messages.
[00:08:45.981 --> 00:08:52.220]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:02.364]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[00:09:02.624 --> 00:09:10.348]  As president, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[00:09:10.928 --> 00:09:16.291]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:19.693]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[00:09:19.733 --> 00:09:22.434]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[00:09:22.734 --> 00:09:25.336]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:09:27.737 --> 00:09:29.698]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[00:09:30.098 --> 00:09:33.620]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:41.645]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:44.050]  The U.S.
[00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.713]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[00:09:48.053 --> 00:09:55.698]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[00:09:56.058 --> 00:09:58.400]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.642]  Of course not, because she's... There's a really loud noise.
[00:10:01.822 --> 00:10:07.145]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[00:10:07.165 --> 00:10:09.387]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[00:10:13.168 --> 00:10:17.617]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:10:41.522 --> 00:10:42.363]  Vote November 8th.
[00:10:42.443 --> 00:10:43.984]  Vote like the world depends on it.
[00:10:45.805 --> 00:11:08.543]  And that is a communication to all of humanity that every major analyst across the political spectrum, from Japan to Germany to the United States, from Russia to Mexico, all the major university heads that study geopolitical systems say we're in the greatest danger of nuclear war we've ever been in, and it's all being spearheaded by the crazies that basically fund and finance Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[00:11:11.343 --> 00:11:14.886]  Now, undoubtedly, if you're a radio listener, that was powerful audio.
[00:11:15.066 --> 00:11:16.748]  If you're a TV viewer, it's even more powerful.
[00:11:17.148 --> 00:11:19.050]  The video is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.872]  This viral video will have Hillary running scared.
[00:11:22.773 --> 00:11:24.535]  It was posted yesterday at about 5 o'clock.
[00:11:25.776 --> 00:11:27.958]  The Facebook version has 700,000 views.
[00:11:28.538 --> 00:11:30.200]  The other YouTube versions have about 300,000.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.941]  So it's got a million views.
[00:11:33.883 --> 00:11:37.827]  Since it went up about 16 hours ago, 17 hours ago, that's not enough.
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:44.683]  Okay, it needs 50 million views and we need to get this out to everybody.
[00:11:44.743 --> 00:11:48.265]  This is what you send to liberals who don't understand what's happening.
[00:11:49.806 --> 00:11:58.611]  You send them undoubtedly the most powerful anti-Hillary ad of the 2016 election.
[00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:02.734]  Hands down, it's pure Veritas and it shows you
[00:12:04.653 --> 00:12:09.874]  The type of world we're going into if we let this bloodthirsty creature into the White House.
[00:12:10.614 --> 00:12:24.178]  So I'm asking everybody to repost it on your Facebook, your Twitter, to send the link out, to copy it to your YouTube page, to send it to Talk Show host, and send it to the Huffington Post, and send it to all of them and say, listen, there's got to be some level
[00:12:25.262 --> 00:12:27.263]  Of self-preservation instinct you've got.
[00:12:27.863 --> 00:12:28.964]  Stop being delusional.
[00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:31.345]  Hillary is not the liberal candidate.
[00:12:31.885 --> 00:12:33.305]  Hillary is a crime boss.
[00:12:34.066 --> 00:12:36.587]  Hillary represents the worst elements on the planet.
[00:12:37.927 --> 00:12:44.850]  And that's why it was the Inspector General of the intelligence agencies that recommended Hillary's server be investigated three years ago.
[00:12:46.131 --> 00:12:47.631]  These leaks aren't coming from the Russians.
[00:12:48.512 --> 00:12:54.074]  They're coming from people inside the DNC and inside the Pentagon and inside the NSA.
[00:12:56.374 --> 00:13:01.236]  Because they understand this country has been hijacked by foreign interest, and the Republic is in great danger.
[00:13:01.276 --> 00:13:14.683]  And I'm not lionizing the different intelligence agencies, but we've now reached the decision point where most of the people in the agencies, not at the top, but below them, understand how serious the situation is.
[00:13:15.183 --> 00:13:22.466]  And InfoWars and others have gotten out the true narrative of what's happening, so we can now have a real debate about what's unfolding.
[00:13:24.187 --> 00:13:24.767]  That said,
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:30.684]  We've seen levels of propaganda against Donald Trump that I've never seen before.
[00:13:32.025 --> 00:13:37.490]  Editing what he has to say, taking out of context, lying, repeating whole cloth lies.
[00:13:38.711 --> 00:13:43.816]  And it wasn't that the media was so much better in the last few decades, it's just that they thought they couldn't get away with it.
[00:13:44.796 --> 00:13:47.459]  Now, because they're so discredited, what do they have to lose?
[00:13:47.559 --> 00:13:48.500]  It's a desperateness.
[00:13:50.828 --> 00:13:56.590]  And I notice, I get Google alerts, so every 30 seconds or so an article comes in that they've written about me these days.
[00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:57.930]  Sometimes it's thousands of articles a day.
[00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:59.250]  Usually it's about 50 to 100.
[00:14:00.151 --> 00:14:03.051]  Major publications attack yours truly every day.
[00:14:03.071 --> 00:14:07.613]  And I don't have time to read through a lot of them, but when I read it now, it's whole cloth lies.
[00:14:07.893 --> 00:14:15.335]  I was reading one big article, big, big, like 20 page write-up on me, and it was just all twisted lies.
[00:14:15.375 --> 00:14:15.735]  It was like,
[00:14:17.867 --> 00:14:18.688]  Quotes I never said.
[00:14:18.708 --> 00:14:20.049]  There weren't even links to videos.
[00:14:20.349 --> 00:14:25.975]  It was just, quote, the same people that run the communists and the Nazis are our National Guard.
[00:14:25.995 --> 00:14:27.376]  Now, I'm quoting the article.
[00:14:27.476 --> 00:14:28.197]  I'm not saying this.
[00:14:28.217 --> 00:14:29.358]  They'll take this out of context, too.
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:35.664]  The same people that run the, that ran the communists and the Nazis
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.247]  Are our National Guard, and they want to call the population.
[00:14:41.367 --> 00:14:41.808]  What the?
[00:14:41.888 --> 00:14:43.771]  I never said the National Guard.
[00:14:43.791 --> 00:14:49.941]  And again, it's these talking points, formulaic against Trump, myself, the Liberty Movement, you name it.
[00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:51.539]  I actually found it.
[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:52.520]  That was Vox.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.602]  Alex Jones, America's most famous conspiracy theorist, explained.
[00:14:55.682 --> 00:15:05.628]  And then, I don't know how you guys just found it so quick, because there's like a hundred articles out today, but that's the one, I guess you searched the term, where it said that, I say the National Guard wants to cull us?
[00:15:06.369 --> 00:15:06.589]  What?
[00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:10.751]  I say it's our military more awake than anybody, because that's a fact.
[00:15:10.811 --> 00:15:11.612]  I just go with the truth.
[00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:14.254]  So they know that.
[00:15:15.196 --> 00:15:21.218]  And that's why they have articles saying, I want a cop kill, and I want to kill the military, and it's all lies.
[00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:24.040]  But their readers sit there and comment on it like it's real.
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:29.282]  And then they go and say he believes Obama sent a tornado, you know, to Oklahoma City.
[00:15:29.562 --> 00:15:31.003]  A woman called in and said, could it be a weather weapon?
[00:15:31.043 --> 00:15:32.623]  I said, they have those, but this probably wasn't.
[00:15:33.363 --> 00:15:35.244]  You know, tornadoes are actually at an all-time low.
[00:15:35.324 --> 00:15:36.705]  So were hurricanes the last 60 years.
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:39.521]  That's the real quote.
[00:15:39.561 --> 00:15:44.704]  They just have Rachel Maddow say that I said Obama sent a tornado five years ago to Oklahoma City.
[00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:50.988]  And it's the same lies, laundry listed out, out of context, the government's making frogs gay.
[00:15:52.088 --> 00:15:55.490]  I do pieces countering them, saying they say it's about making frogs gay.
[00:15:55.751 --> 00:16:02.655]  They take the clip out and put it in a Hillary ad when I was describing how that's what they take out of context.
[00:16:04.224 --> 00:16:19.487]  And so he's running this laundry list, but now it's hit new level, where they just say, Alex Jones says the National Guard runs the Nazis and the Communists, and it's the National Guard that runs everything, and the National Guard is going to kill you, and gonna invade Texas and kill you.
[00:16:20.927 --> 00:16:23.288]  We never said Jade Helm was an actual invasion.
[00:16:23.628 --> 00:16:29.829]  We're on record saying it was a simulation for occupation and invasion, and I've talked to, let's not exaggerate, in person,
[00:16:30.845 --> 00:16:34.187]  Probably 20 of the soldiers that were involved in Jade Helm.
[00:16:34.207 --> 00:16:42.090]  And they said we all knew it was absolutely dual use for invading the United States and full spectrum dominance and control of populations.
[00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.532]  And the Pentagon documents all admit that it was a conditioning operation.
[00:16:45.772 --> 00:16:48.173]  And the military admits in the Army Times that's what they're doing.
[00:16:52.855 --> 00:16:58.998]  The military, quite frankly, a lot of times reports on this stuff hoping the public gets concerned and does something about it.
[00:17:02.025 --> 00:17:03.385]  So I don't want to get into myself here.
[00:17:03.485 --> 00:17:07.647]  I'm just saying when you look at the level of deception, it is getting crazy.
[00:17:08.967 --> 00:17:10.767]  But I want to explain something to all my detractors.
[00:17:11.608 --> 00:17:22.771]  The reason we're successful, the reason the information we put out is now the countervailing narrative to your system of lies, your kingdom of fraud, your tissue of deception.
[00:17:24.076 --> 00:17:24.997]  Your false reality?
[00:17:25.858 --> 00:17:26.999]  It's because I've studied history.
[00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:28.840]  I've interviewed all the top experts, basically.
[00:17:29.421 --> 00:17:31.283]  I'm immersed in this, and we know what we're talking about.
[00:17:31.723 --> 00:17:32.584]  I'm looking for the truth.
[00:17:32.604 --> 00:17:33.525]  Doesn't mean I have all of it.
[00:17:33.825 --> 00:17:34.986]  Doesn't mean I'm infallible.
[00:17:35.026 --> 00:17:35.506]  Far from it.
[00:17:35.546 --> 00:17:41.392]  But trying to tell the truth, trying to be researched, trying to do the right thing is a world of difference from you.
[00:17:43.905 --> 00:17:48.569]  So I want to explain something to all the detractors out there because I want to reach out to you.
[00:17:48.709 --> 00:17:50.171]  I want you to break free of the matrix.
[00:17:50.311 --> 00:17:54.635]  I want you to understand that you're being controlled and you're living in a delusional system.
[00:17:54.915 --> 00:17:55.616]  Some of you know that.
[00:17:55.656 --> 00:17:56.437]  You're mercenaries.
[00:17:57.598 --> 00:17:58.619]  You're very, very cynical.
[00:17:59.039 --> 00:17:59.980]  So you just don't care.
[00:18:01.041 --> 00:18:02.862]  But a lot of you really do think you're on the winning team.
[00:18:02.882 --> 00:18:05.985]  So I want to explain something to you very, very succinctly here, okay?
[00:18:07.767 --> 00:18:08.808]  And just hope you listen.
[00:18:12.739 --> 00:18:15.661]  I'm not trying to win a popularity contest.
[00:18:15.921 --> 00:18:17.242]  I'm trying to change the world.
[00:18:17.322 --> 00:18:26.388]  I'm not trying to say the countervailing political system's song sheet show that I get accepted and promoted up through the system.
[00:18:26.769 --> 00:18:28.730]  That's your worldview, not mine.
[00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:35.315]  When Karl Rove confronted me, or I kind of confronted him, then he confronted me back, at a Dallas airport flying out to Cleveland for the RNC,
[00:18:36.957 --> 00:18:39.898]  He goes, Alex, you just don't play by the rules.
[00:18:39.938 --> 00:18:42.939]  Hazard's laughing at me like he's got power.
[00:18:43.659 --> 00:18:47.380]  When an average hour of this show has more viewers and listeners now than Fox News.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.740]  We've now achieved that.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.540]  Even mainstream media has to admit it.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.001]  They are in full panic mode.
[00:18:52.321 --> 00:19:00.103]  I've got this guy that's a pundit on a show that runs around grabbing the Republican money every cycle for himself to make sure Democrats win.
[00:19:01.465 --> 00:19:07.146]  And he's sitting there, you know, it's come out in the WikiLeaks, all of it, you know, Paul Ryan, all of them totally work for the Democrats.
[00:19:07.926 --> 00:19:24.049]  And they just think we're so incredibly stupid that, I'm gonna skip this break, that he sat there and he looks at me with a straight face and says, you don't play by the rules and starts laughing like, like I'm a loser, like I'm a failure.
[00:19:27.069 --> 00:19:30.510]  InfoWars is undoubtedly bigger than Rush Limbaugh now.
[00:19:31.525 --> 00:19:31.905]  Way bigger.
[00:19:32.646 --> 00:19:34.707]  With his demographic, he's still dominant.
[00:19:34.747 --> 00:19:35.908]  With the old folks and things, that's fine.
[00:19:36.088 --> 00:19:37.209]  I'm not in competition with Rush Limbaugh.
[00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:43.714]  I want my talking points, my ideas, to be forced into the spectrum of what Rush Limbaugh's covering.
[00:19:43.734 --> 00:19:44.094]  And guess what?
[00:19:44.254 --> 00:19:44.875]  I have succeeded.
[00:19:45.135 --> 00:19:45.716]  I've had victory.
[00:19:46.776 --> 00:19:47.977]  So this isn't about bragging.
[00:19:48.017 --> 00:19:55.463]  This is about you getting a battle report on the war that you're winning, I'm winning, Trump's winning, all the metrics show.
[00:19:55.483 --> 00:19:56.463]  I'm about to get to it in a moment.
[00:19:56.503 --> 00:19:57.004]  It's incredible.
[00:19:58.083 --> 00:20:03.107]  But just to understand something, I'm not here trying to rearrange deck chairs on the Titanic.
[00:20:03.468 --> 00:20:05.549]  I'm not here trying to win a popularity contest.
[00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:16.539]  I'm here to shock people with the truth, to let them make fun of me, to let them go through their comfort zone, and then to plant the seeds so down the road, as it gets more and more clear that I'm right, people will listen.
[00:20:16.739 --> 00:20:17.079]  And guess what?
[00:20:17.119 --> 00:20:18.981]  We're already down the road, and what's happened?
[00:20:20.455 --> 00:20:36.882]  They have to shut down freedom on the web, they have to shut down free speech, because as all this world government openly comes out and it's totally tyrannical and it wants to make you poor, by design, and make you a permanent, impoverished population, you're going to then know I was right.
[00:20:37.322 --> 00:20:39.963]  It doesn't matter if you don't go read Carol Quigley's Tragedy and Hope.
[00:20:40.163 --> 00:20:44.305]  It doesn't matter if you won't go read Rosenstein's books.
[00:20:45.045 --> 00:20:48.126]  It doesn't matter if you won't read Ecoscience by the White House Science Czar.
[00:20:48.446 --> 00:20:49.207]  It won't matter!
[00:20:50.236 --> 00:20:54.600]  Because you will be forced into reality one way or another.
[00:20:56.581 --> 00:20:57.422]  And so that's what's happening.
[00:20:57.442 --> 00:21:02.806]  This is a kingdom of con artists that think you're stupid and think that they control you and think that you're dumb.
[00:21:03.867 --> 00:21:08.531]  All over Texas, people I personally know have seen their votes flipped.
[00:21:08.991 --> 00:21:10.993]  Smart people trying to vote for Trump.
[00:21:12.574 --> 00:21:15.256]  Now it's coming out in Maryland, Ohio, Colorado.
[00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:15.917]  It's flooding in.
[00:21:16.677 --> 00:21:19.660]  Heads of elections in counties are having it happen to them.
[00:21:20.831 --> 00:21:22.432]  We just played a report in the first five minutes.
[00:21:23.192 --> 00:21:25.593]  We now have video in Texas of this happening.
[00:21:26.533 --> 00:21:43.200]  But don't worry, CNN came out and talked to a state election official, who days before ran from our reporters, and said there's no vote flipping, no problems, even though I'm showing it right now, making you vote for the Democrat, not letting you vote for the Republican.
[00:21:45.541 --> 00:21:45.681]  So,
[00:21:47.844 --> 00:21:50.665]  We're not getting reports of it flipping from Hillary to Trump around the country.
[00:21:50.845 --> 00:21:51.225]  No, no, no.
[00:21:51.285 --> 00:21:53.206]  It's always Trump to Hillary.
[00:21:53.866 --> 00:21:55.627]  Or straight ticket to the Democrats.
[00:21:57.087 --> 00:22:04.630]  But, oh, CNN, they said that none of it's happening, so I can go back to sleep now.
[00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.051]  And I love how the formulaic BS is so dumbed down.
[00:22:08.412 --> 00:22:11.793]  But Goebbels said good propaganda is really dumbed down if you want to actually dumb down the public.
[00:22:12.952 --> 00:22:18.316]  See, slick information, accurate information, raises the intellect and the level of discussion.
[00:22:18.736 --> 00:22:19.617]  They don't want that.
[00:22:19.657 --> 00:22:22.959]  They just think you're dumb and say, conspiracy theorist.
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:31.205]  If you listen to the people on the ground that survived and said that they got, what, six different stand-down orders directly from Hillary Clinton.
[00:22:33.342 --> 00:22:34.463]  They just say that doesn't happen.
[00:22:34.483 --> 00:22:35.343]  They're conspiracy theorists.
[00:22:35.664 --> 00:22:36.184]  They lived it.
[00:22:36.244 --> 00:22:36.925]  They're the heroes.
[00:22:36.965 --> 00:22:37.525]  They survived.
[00:22:37.545 --> 00:22:38.145]  Their friends died.
[00:22:38.606 --> 00:22:41.047]  But the media said they're conspiracy theorists.
[00:22:41.067 --> 00:22:44.550]  That's all they've got is to say this person is a leading heretic.
[00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:49.593]  This person is a leading individual that challenges the establishment narrative.
[00:22:49.613 --> 00:22:52.775]  Well, absolutely, I wear that as a badge of honor.
[00:22:54.056 --> 00:22:54.657]  And I am so
[00:22:58.373 --> 00:23:07.099]  Just incredibly blessed that, for whatever reason in my life, I'm in the position to resist these people, because these are bad, bad folks, and every fiber of my being wants to stand up against them.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:20.609]  But what happens is, once somebody signs on to a con, they get deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and deeper into it, and they just can't admit they're wrong, they just can't admit what they're doing is wrong.
[00:23:21.009 --> 00:23:25.312]  They double down because they don't want to admit that they were wrong, or that things are scary.
[00:23:26.516 --> 00:23:30.297]  And so things get scarier and scarier and scarier and scarier.
[00:23:31.617 --> 00:23:33.878]  Now with the Podesta data dumps, we're up to number 21.
[00:23:33.978 --> 00:23:36.998]  Let me show folks some of the stories up on DrugsReport.com.
[00:23:37.018 --> 00:23:38.959]  We can punch that up on screen for TV viewers.
[00:23:41.399 --> 00:23:43.039]  Dump 21 developing.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.361]  Campaign struggles to reach effing dumb young people.
[00:23:50.201 --> 00:23:50.981]  Every data dump.
[00:23:53.062 --> 00:23:54.942]  Paul Watson just searches the term dumb.
[00:23:55.942 --> 00:23:56.583]  Or basement.
[00:23:57.123 --> 00:23:58.264]  Or black people.
[00:23:59.505 --> 00:24:03.168]  And, I mean, yesterday it was, man, these are some dumb black people.
[00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:06.811]  Yeah, David Brock seems to think black people are dumb.
[00:24:07.332 --> 00:24:13.317]  Well, you know, or, oh yeah, these Bernie Sanders people living in their mother's basements and baristas and all these poor people.
[00:24:13.937 --> 00:24:14.538]  Poor stupid people.
[00:24:16.946 --> 00:24:21.429]  And more, and more, and more, and more, and more is coming out.
[00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.792]  That's the mindset of these individuals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:25.272 --> 00:24:29.976]  You've got Hillary basically falling down again yesterday, stumbling around everywhere, looks completely out of her mind.
[00:24:30.416 --> 00:24:32.818]  But that's okay, because I'm with her.
[00:24:34.419 --> 00:24:41.964]  Now, I'm going to get more into this when we come back from break, but first I want to get into the latest poll numbers and what's happening with election fraud.
[00:24:42.884 --> 00:24:44.125]  But just understand this.
[00:24:44.625 --> 00:24:46.507]  You don't have to believe what I believe.
[00:24:46.527 --> 00:24:48.008]  You don't have to see things the way I do.
[00:24:48.028 --> 00:24:53.253]  Even though I'm going off what the establishment says themselves are their real plans.
[00:24:54.233 --> 00:25:04.402]  You've just got to admit to yourself that the entire power structure that you claim you're against, that you know is screwing you over, that's consolidating control, trying to make you poor to control you, is for Hillary.
[00:25:06.764 --> 00:25:09.865]  And I tell you, it's the lottery ticket mentality.
[00:25:09.905 --> 00:25:30.594]  People that want to buy into a bandwagon and want to be delusional and feel like they're winners and feel like they're making this really smart, cool choice because we have people like Michelle Obama and Hillary getting up there invoking that he's mean to girls because of some 11-year-old edited tape.
[00:25:32.134 --> 00:25:33.695]  Meanwhile, they're hosting rappers
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:42.264]  That actually sing songs at the White House, like Rick Ross, about drugging women and raping them.
[00:25:44.685 --> 00:25:47.727]  We're gonna play these lyrics later, we bleeped it, but it's coming up.
[00:25:47.807 --> 00:25:56.992]  And it's just, it's the level of hypocrisy and all the corruption, all the evil, and just the sickeningness in the videos of Michelle's daughters twerking.
[00:25:58.578 --> 00:25:58.999]  to this.
[00:25:59.699 --> 00:26:07.469]  Inducting their daughters into big, fat, horrible goblin creatures, you know, that are sitting there teaching people how to be nothing but whores.
[00:26:08.851 --> 00:26:14.979]  So they're inducting our entire nation's daughters into all these, you know, filthy prison cultures.
[00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:24.975]  And of course, Rick Ross is a former prison guard who got basically hired to take over the identity of the real Rick Ross to cover up the CIA drug dealing.
[00:26:24.995 --> 00:26:26.075]  I mean, the whole thing's a psy-op.
[00:26:26.776 --> 00:26:38.303]  The whole thing's a psy-op, folks, with Jay-Z and Kanye and all these other people, and they're there at the White House like you're a fool, like you're a moron.
[00:26:38.343 --> 00:26:42.126]  Now, coming up, I'm going to get more into this, but let me just go ahead and break some of this down for you right now.
[00:26:42.646 --> 00:26:45.108]  A vote for Hillary is a vote for World War III.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:51.530]  And I want to encourage everybody to get that video out to everyone you know.
[00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:55.137]  Yes, it's got a million views in the last, oh, since 5 p.m.
[00:26:55.177 --> 00:26:55.357]  yesterday.
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:02.124]  I'm going to get mad that it doesn't get 20 million views by the end of the weekend, okay?
[00:27:02.905 --> 00:27:05.227]  And this is a frustration I have, because I've said this thousands of times.
[00:27:06.188 --> 00:27:12.835]  It's just some important video, but not that important compared to other stuff, and it gets 20, 30 million views, 60 million views, whatever the case is.
[00:27:12.895 --> 00:27:15.377]  Every week this happens, we'll have some video that goes huge.
[00:27:15.397 --> 00:27:17.900]  30 million, you know, on a press conference that we had last week.
[00:27:20.174 --> 00:27:21.054]  More than 30 million now.
[00:27:22.055 --> 00:27:24.175]  And it's not that much important stuff came out in it.
[00:27:24.195 --> 00:27:25.075]  You know, it's frustrating.
[00:27:25.856 --> 00:27:30.577]  And then something like this would change the election 100% for Trump.
[00:27:32.117 --> 00:27:32.697]  If you get it out.
[00:27:33.038 --> 00:27:42.740]  A vote for Hillary is a vote for World War III, is Paul Watson's article that has a version from his YouTube channel posted that shows what we're headed for if Hillary gets in.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.201]  Very powerful.
[00:27:46.561 --> 00:27:47.882]  Again, on Facebook, it's got almost 700,000 views.
[00:27:50.239 --> 00:27:51.480]  That's a YouTube version there.
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.501]  I'm begging everyone.
[00:27:53.841 --> 00:27:55.663]  This is an information warfare tool.
[00:27:55.743 --> 00:27:56.643]  It's very accurate.
[00:27:56.964 --> 00:27:57.824]  It's very truthful.
[00:27:59.565 --> 00:28:01.326]  90% of it is real world stuff that's happening.
[00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:08.051]  The other 10% is what a nuclear attack with a 40 megaton hydrogen bomb would look like hitting New York City.
[00:28:10.332 --> 00:28:11.753]  And Leanne McAdoo is in the middle of it.
[00:28:13.014 --> 00:28:15.496]  Like the fiery goddess being burned to bits.
[00:28:15.836 --> 00:28:16.537]  It's powerful.
[00:28:17.197 --> 00:28:19.899]  And this is better than anything you'll see the Trump campaign put out.
[00:28:21.698 --> 00:28:25.199]  I don't want to sit there and lobby the Trump campaign, because let's just be frank about our audience.
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:26.780]  You are the Trump campaign.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.541]  Trump knows that, by the way.
[00:28:28.601 --> 00:28:34.523]  You are the number one group, Infowarriors, in the Trump support system.
[00:28:35.224 --> 00:28:36.884]  So, we brought Trump.
[00:28:36.964 --> 00:28:37.905]  He doesn't bring us.
[00:28:38.765 --> 00:28:45.688]  And I understand he's got politicos around him that think they're taking a safe course and that's fine, but every time his son sends out some of our stuff or he does, the media attacks.
[00:28:45.728 --> 00:28:49.049]  That's because they know it's powerful info that breaks through the conditioning.
[00:28:49.489 --> 00:28:50.110]  Trump knows that.
[00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:50.710]  We need Trump.
[00:28:52.438 --> 00:28:54.239]  To retweet this video.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:55.740]  I never lobby.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:56.681]  I'm gonna get on the phone or later.
[00:28:56.701 --> 00:28:58.702]  I'm gonna call Stephen Bannon at Breitbart, his campaign.
[00:28:58.722 --> 00:29:00.503]  I'm gonna say, hey listen, you need to put this video out.
[00:29:01.303 --> 00:29:08.468]  Because I know, just as sure as the sun came up this morning, and I'm gonna do a couple more similar campaign ads.
[00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:22.139]  That if these get out, this will absolutely put the final nails in the career of the serial criminal, the kleptocrat, the grifter that is Hillary Rodham Clinton and the giant, filthy train.
[00:29:22.539 --> 00:29:25.501]  Like a big shark has all these little fish following it, you know, that feed off of it.
[00:29:25.781 --> 00:29:33.767]  This huge train of the Saudi Arabians and the communist Chinese and all the drug dealers and narcotics traffickers and weirdo child molester groups and everything else.
[00:29:33.807 --> 00:29:34.748]  I mean, this woman is a
[00:29:35.288 --> 00:29:36.128]  Frickin' demon.
[00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:40.331]  That's why everybody's done the analysis of her and knows she wants to start big wars.
[00:29:40.731 --> 00:29:41.571]  She's like a demon.
[00:29:42.151 --> 00:29:44.713]  She cannot help but go to the flame.
[00:29:47.214 --> 00:29:48.795]  They cannot help but go to the flame.
[00:29:48.835 --> 00:29:49.575]  They cannot help.
[00:29:49.915 --> 00:29:53.557]  I mean, in Russia, she is known as the witch on State Run TV.
[00:29:54.438 --> 00:29:55.238]  She is a witch.
[00:29:55.698 --> 00:29:56.539]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:57.319 --> 00:29:57.939]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:57.979 --> 00:29:58.840]  This is the InfoWar.
[00:30:00.305 --> 00:30:03.312]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.234 --> 00:30:06.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:19.128 --> 00:30:23.331]  A CBS Chicago investigation finds dead people voting in Chicago.
[00:30:23.591 --> 00:30:28.074]  Susie Sally died in 1998, but voted in Chicago 12 years later.
[00:30:28.294 --> 00:30:30.015]  Victor Croswalk died in 1994.
[00:30:30.915 --> 00:30:32.396]  He's voted six times since.
[00:30:32.657 --> 00:30:38.040]  Floyd Stevens passed in 1993, but records have him showing up to the polls 11 times since then.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:49.422]  Earl Smith, Tedesco Siesla are also amongst the 119 deceased voters that have cast ballots a total of 229 times in Chicago over the last decade.
[00:30:49.642 --> 00:30:50.842]  May they rest in peace.
[00:30:51.242 --> 00:30:55.843]  Jim Allen, a city election board spokesperson said, this isn't the bad old days.
[00:30:56.163 --> 00:31:00.244]  No, I guess it's the good new days where you can get away with election fraud.
[00:31:00.524 --> 00:31:05.485]  So CBS has now reported finding dead voters in Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles.
[00:31:05.745 --> 00:31:06.327]  Where next?
[00:31:06.528 --> 00:31:08.937]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com

[00:33:12.441 --> 00:33:22.846]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:58.439 --> 00:34:04.984]  Walker put together one of our great graphics people, that little Halloween intro, with really how creepy and scary the Clintons are.
[00:34:05.925 --> 00:34:11.489]  And of course it was Darren McBreen and Leon Magnus that put together the nuclear war emergency report.
[00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:14.952]  A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for World War III.
[00:34:15.632 --> 00:34:18.855]  This is definitely the most powerful political ad of 2016.
[00:34:20.447 --> 00:34:22.788]  And believe me, I would give credit to anybody else that did it.
[00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:23.429]  I don't care.
[00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:24.149]  Everybody knows that.
[00:34:24.890 --> 00:34:28.412]  I'm just saying that, so people understand, this is the one.
[00:34:29.212 --> 00:34:35.516]  It's the truth, and with the demographics, it's one of the only ways to reach liberals that have any basic instincts for survival anymore.
[00:34:36.557 --> 00:34:38.418]  Hillary is a known warmonger.
[00:34:39.079 --> 00:34:40.419]  The Pentagon has warned of this.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.060]  Everyone has.
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:42.621]  She is very unstable.
[00:34:43.201 --> 00:34:45.883]  She admits in WikiLeaks that her, quote, instincts are very bad.
[00:34:47.458 --> 00:34:48.679]  She has a vicious temper.
[00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:50.080]  I don't mean one that just flares here and there.
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:56.024]  I mean, it's what drives her, it's what controls her, and she wants to dominate and absolutely control.
[00:34:56.124 --> 00:34:58.646]  Now, here's the huge news, obviously.
[00:35:00.587 --> 00:35:03.109]  Maryland Trump supporter, they switched my vote to Hillary.
[00:35:03.329 --> 00:35:04.350]  Infowars.com.
[00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:08.232]  Clinton insider, rigging only way Hillary can win.
[00:35:10.114 --> 00:35:10.534]  Look at this one.
[00:35:12.554 --> 00:35:17.716]  Two investigators, Chicago votes cast ballots beyond the grave at CBS News.
[00:35:17.736 --> 00:35:18.877]  This is happening all over the country.
[00:35:20.798 --> 00:35:21.558]  Look at this one.
[00:35:21.618 --> 00:35:22.658]  This one's out of Bloomberg.
[00:35:23.699 --> 00:35:25.980]  Now remember, nobody wants illegals to vote.
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:27.420]  There's no illegals voting.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.721]  There's no such thing happening.
[00:35:28.741 --> 00:35:40.366]  But you can pull up hundreds of articles in the Chicago Tribune, the LA Times, you name it, saying we're going to let illegals vote.
[00:35:42.728 --> 00:35:46.411]  I mean, you can land off an airplane and not have a visa, anything.
[00:35:48.232 --> 00:35:49.113]  And you just get to vote.
[00:35:49.573 --> 00:35:54.557]  I mean, imagine if you showed up in Mexico or New Zealand or, I mean, anywhere and said, Hi, I'm here.
[00:35:54.577 --> 00:35:54.977]  I'm here to vote.
[00:35:54.997 --> 00:35:55.517]  They're like, what?
[00:35:56.198 --> 00:35:57.519]  Are you a Kiwi citizen, sir?
[00:35:58.439 --> 00:35:59.200]  No, but I get to.
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:35:59.940]  Why are you racist?
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.002]  They'd be like, uh, you know, boom.
[00:36:03.183 --> 00:36:06.685]  It's so outrageous, but only in America under political correctness.
[00:36:06.705 --> 00:36:07.566]  So here's the article.
[00:36:07.586 --> 00:36:08.507]  I want to show this for TV viewers.
[00:36:08.807 --> 00:36:11.629]  This is out of Bloomberg, right here for folks.
[00:36:14.634 --> 00:36:18.376]  Some cities, see this is what London's already saying, we don't care what Brexit does.
[00:36:18.996 --> 00:36:21.817]  We've got our Muslim mayor, we're just going to bring people in and issue our own visas here.
[00:36:22.378 --> 00:36:22.958]  It's a breakaway.
[00:36:23.718 --> 00:36:24.839]  The global is breaking up our country.
[00:36:25.379 --> 00:36:28.160]  Some cities want their immigrants to vote.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.601]  They're not illegal immigrants.
[00:36:29.661 --> 00:36:32.082]  Look at illegal immigrants voting all over this country.
[00:36:32.122 --> 00:36:38.025]  Donald Trump recently claimed in a Fox News interview, part of the ongoing effort to cast doubt on the integrity of the presidential election.
[00:36:38.265 --> 00:36:40.106]  I love how they'll take where he's right,
[00:36:41.263 --> 00:36:42.024]  And use it against him.
[00:36:42.044 --> 00:36:45.447]  In fact, I always hear it even on local radio and Fox Radio.
[00:36:45.487 --> 00:36:48.070]  They'll be like, wow, Hillary's destroying Trump.
[00:36:48.931 --> 00:36:52.074]  She's out raising contributions five to one.
[00:36:52.094 --> 00:36:53.495]  And you find out they're all corporate.
[00:36:53.515 --> 00:36:54.276]  They're all billionaires.
[00:36:55.457 --> 00:36:58.120]  Wow, he's really getting his butt kicked.
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.923]  We should be proud of the fact he's not getting any elitist money.
[00:37:01.343 --> 00:37:05.027]  But they take his strengths and they turn it into a weakness.
[00:37:06.914 --> 00:37:09.296]  So, some cities want their immigrants to vote.
[00:37:09.316 --> 00:37:13.359]  Then you read the next paragraph, oh, that Donald Trump claims that illegals are voting.
[00:37:13.399 --> 00:37:13.819]  It's happening.
[00:37:13.839 --> 00:37:23.006]  We have Democrats, the head of the Democratic Party's vote operation, Kramer, admitting they're engaged in mass fraud, and then his number two saying it.
[00:37:23.267 --> 00:37:24.908]  And there's nothing anybody can do to stop us.
[00:37:25.308 --> 00:37:27.430]  I could F my mother and get away with it.
[00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:27.930]  That's a quote.
[00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:31.253]  I could F my mother and get away with it.
[00:37:32.705 --> 00:37:53.081]  They're so arrogant now they dance around Gruber and Ezekiel Emanuel have been back on TV this week laughing at us and saying we're just going to raise penalties and gouge you more and giggling and snickering and saying it was never going to be free and clicking their heels together like little little little flying monkeys or something.
[00:37:53.482 --> 00:37:58.626]  I mean this is getting more and more out of control because it's all a giant con game.
[00:37:58.846 --> 00:38:02.009]  They are raping us in front of everyone and it's funny.
[00:38:03.234 --> 00:38:09.577]  And they're all these little soft, smart-ass little nerds, just like Joseph Goebbels and the people that serve the Nazis.
[00:38:09.597 --> 00:38:12.718]  They're always these little chicken-neck, smart-mouthed punks.
[00:38:13.999 --> 00:38:15.040]  Dishonorable filth.
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:21.763]  But, oh, Donald Trump's so wrong, the illegals are voting, and a whole bunch of cities are letting him vote, but he's wrong.
[00:38:22.823 --> 00:38:23.503]  He's wrong.
[00:38:24.204 --> 00:38:26.965]  We are doing it, and it is happening, but it doesn't exist.
[00:38:27.125 --> 00:38:28.226]  There are death penalties.
[00:38:31.187 --> 00:38:32.768]  There are these different death boards.
[00:38:34.423 --> 00:38:38.410]  You can't keep your doctor when triple your prices and there is a big fat IRS penalty!
[00:38:39.892 --> 00:38:41.334]  The new talking point all over the news is...
[00:38:43.024 --> 00:38:45.746]  I don't know what the Republicans and people's problem is.
[00:38:46.446 --> 00:38:56.912]  And Donald Trump, I mean, you always had to pay a penalty, and if you're not interfacing with the IRS when you go to sign up, you know, for your health care, well then you've got a serious problem.
[00:38:56.952 --> 00:38:57.652]  And that's what it is.
[00:38:57.752 --> 00:39:05.617]  It's a compliance system for the IRS to make you interface with the IRS to get your health care, and so you don't get health care if you don't pay
[00:39:06.477 --> 00:39:08.318]  The IRS or you're not in their system.
[00:39:08.879 --> 00:39:09.940]  And then it goes vice versa.
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.761]  It's a corporate tax to offshore insurance companies and banks.
[00:39:13.842 --> 00:39:17.925]  It allows control over health care and the delivery of it and what type of health care you get.
[00:39:18.045 --> 00:39:22.448]  It is a nightmare of control with Swiss cheese in it.
[00:39:23.049 --> 00:39:26.171]  Holes everywhere so the establishment is exempt from the damn thing.
[00:39:32.828 --> 00:39:36.591]  And of course everyone's saying, ooh, Hillary's gonna have to reform this, oh yeah.
[00:39:36.951 --> 00:39:38.192]  It was always in the WikiLeaks.
[00:39:38.512 --> 00:39:49.660]  We told you long before it was in the WikiLeaks that it was designed to implode because they would go on C-SPAN and write articles and books to their constituents saying this is a screw job.
[00:39:50.728 --> 00:39:56.611]  You know, to the general public, no, their constituents are the big banks, the intelligentsia, where they all hop around and giggle like Gruber on TV.
[00:39:56.831 --> 00:39:58.832]  Thank God everyone's so dumb in America.
[00:39:59.052 --> 00:40:00.753]  Thank God they have no attention span.
[00:40:00.913 --> 00:40:02.053]  We can really rip them off.
[00:40:02.713 --> 00:40:03.554]  It's the same thing.
[00:40:03.874 --> 00:40:05.295]  They put out the whole deal.
[00:40:05.315 --> 00:40:09.396]  People are like, wow, Alex, you were right again that Hillary wants it to fail to bring in something even worse.
[00:40:09.797 --> 00:40:10.677]  How did you know that?
[00:40:10.717 --> 00:40:11.477]  You're so smart.
[00:40:11.797 --> 00:40:12.698]  I'm so smart?
[00:40:19.222 --> 00:40:20.563]  I mean, I can't take this anymore.
[00:40:21.024 --> 00:40:21.945]  I'm not smart.
[00:40:22.525 --> 00:40:23.486]  I've got a memory though.
[00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:30.392]  It's not smart or exceptional to not be an idiot.
[00:40:32.254 --> 00:40:41.061]  And to not let people talk down to you and call, they still call me a conspiracy theorist, a badge of honor, by the way, because I say Obamacare is a screw job.
[00:40:43.403 --> 00:40:46.526]  I mean, everyone knows it's a screw job, but again, it's the same tactic.
[00:40:48.506 --> 00:40:50.066]  This is weaponized media right here, folks.
[00:40:50.446 --> 00:40:51.347]  You want it, you're about to read it.
[00:40:53.087 --> 00:40:55.027]  Some cities want their immigrants to vote.
[00:40:55.468 --> 00:41:01.289]  Look at illegal immigrants voting all over this country, Donald Trump recently claimed in a Fox News interview.
[00:41:02.449 --> 00:41:05.690]  Part of his ongoing effort to cast doubt on the integrity of the presidential elections.
[00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:09.230]  There's no evidence to support the Republican nominee's claims of election fraud.
[00:41:09.611 --> 00:41:10.111]  Oh, no.
[00:41:10.191 --> 00:41:11.931]  And then notice they use a lawyer term.
[00:41:12.231 --> 00:41:13.831]  Voter fraud and election fraud are two different things.
[00:41:15.072 --> 00:41:16.312]  Generally, election fraud is electronic.
[00:41:17.651 --> 00:41:18.472]  Massive evidence of that.
[00:41:18.492 --> 00:41:19.253]  It's a historical fact.
[00:41:19.513 --> 00:41:24.698]  But there's also organized voter fraud at the precinct and county level.
[00:41:25.836 --> 00:41:27.497]  And so that becomes election fraud.
[00:41:27.517 --> 00:41:28.338]  So there's three different types.
[00:41:28.418 --> 00:41:33.441]  Pure voter fraud, election fraud, and then election fraud through mass organized voter fraud.
[00:41:33.521 --> 00:41:34.642]  I'll give you some real definitions there.
[00:41:35.363 --> 00:41:35.903]  But let's continue.
[00:41:36.303 --> 00:41:37.384]  Quote, there's no evidence.
[00:41:37.584 --> 00:41:38.064]  That's right.
[00:41:38.164 --> 00:41:39.846]  Oh, thank you, Bloomberg.
[00:41:40.206 --> 00:41:41.547]  And you don't want our guns either, right?
[00:41:41.567 --> 00:41:42.968]  Remember Bloomberg a few years ago wrote an article.
[00:41:42.988 --> 00:41:45.750]  He said, I'm the biggest Second Amendment supporter there is.
[00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:46.390]  That's the headline.
[00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:48.872]  No one believes in it more than me.
[00:41:52.637 --> 00:41:55.178]  That's like saying Jeffrey Dahmer, you know, doesn't like to kill people.
[00:41:55.278 --> 00:41:58.399]  I mean, it's just, they talk to you like you're a moron.
[00:41:58.419 --> 00:42:09.323]  Because they're such psychopathic control freaks, they think they can force feed you, and it's all about when will they comply, when will they comply, just intensify the lies, just intensify the lies.
[00:42:10.124 --> 00:42:11.864]  So some cities want their immigrants to vote.
[00:42:12.465 --> 00:42:16.066]  That's outrageous, that's sedition, but they have it there in a headline like it's no big deal.
[00:42:16.726 --> 00:42:18.307]  See, it's all an assault on reality.
[00:42:21.257 --> 00:42:28.705]  There's no evidence supporting the Republican nominee's claims of election fraud, but some cities are moving to expand voting rights to include non-citizens.
[00:42:29.165 --> 00:42:29.305]  Oh!
[00:42:29.926 --> 00:42:34.090]  Cities are gonna let people vote when it violates federal and state law!
[00:42:36.273 --> 00:42:37.414]  But Donald Trump isn't right about it.
[00:42:40.475 --> 00:42:41.095]  And it goes on.
[00:42:41.235 --> 00:42:43.816]  Non-citizen voting isn't as radical as it might sound.
[00:42:44.276 --> 00:42:54.339]  And then it just goes on of how good it is, and how nice it is, and how fun it is, and it just goes on and on and on and on, and, oh, we've brought all these people in, so now they deserve a say, and blah blah blah.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:55.980]  So there you go.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:07.624]  They know they've got readers that have been turned against Trump, so they bring them into the next phase of tyranny by going, Trump is evil, and this doesn't exist, but it does exist,
[00:43:08.757 --> 00:43:10.718]  And Trump doesn't like it, and you're now part of our club.
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:16.301]  I mean, this is mind control, people.
[00:43:17.241 --> 00:43:18.161]  This is mind control.
[00:43:18.602 --> 00:43:19.642]  So that's just one of the articles.
[00:43:19.682 --> 00:43:22.423]  So, Maryland, Trump supporter, they switched my vote.
[00:43:22.443 --> 00:43:23.844]  There's video, InfoWars.com.
[00:43:24.444 --> 00:43:26.225]  Yet another report of vote flipping.
[00:43:26.766 --> 00:43:33.869]  John Bannon had a report at the start of the show where they had the election official certify that was flipping votes across their systems.
[00:43:35.131 --> 00:43:39.873]  We have it on the Texas letterhead, but CNN says there's no truth to it.
[00:43:39.913 --> 00:43:42.393]  It's another wild conspiracy theory.
[00:43:44.734 --> 00:43:49.676]  But the good news is CNN has almost no credibility, but that's the crazy part is they just keep moving forward with the fraud.
[00:43:52.016 --> 00:43:56.898]  So, another two investigators, Chicago vote cast ballots from beyond the grave.
[00:43:58.143 --> 00:43:59.984]  A vote for Hillary is a vote for World War III.
[00:44:00.024 --> 00:44:01.085]  I mentioned that's very, very important.
[00:44:01.105 --> 00:44:01.986]  Don't forget this one.
[00:44:02.026 --> 00:44:02.726]  WikiLeaks email.
[00:44:02.766 --> 00:44:06.049]  Hillary campaign struggles to reach effing dumb young people.
[00:44:09.091 --> 00:44:10.832]  Yeah, they're so dumb they don't like your Obamacare.
[00:44:10.852 --> 00:44:19.378]  I also want to get into Clinton and Michelle Obama make their first joint campaign to talk about the horrible misogyny of Donald Trump.
[00:44:19.599 --> 00:44:25.063]  While they have the dirtiest, arrested development, dumbass thugs,
[00:44:26.135 --> 00:44:27.115]  Well, they're not dumbass thugs.
[00:44:27.155 --> 00:44:29.376]  I mean, a lot of them are real thugs, but they're also just predators.
[00:44:29.396 --> 00:44:30.116]  They're pimping everybody.
[00:44:31.677 --> 00:44:33.698]  Up there singing about date-raping women.
[00:44:34.278 --> 00:44:39.260]  These are songs on the list sent out to the White House while Michelle's daughter shakes their asses.
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:52.924]  So she pimps her daughters out, literally, to big, fat, demonic pig monsters who are all about using everyone and being basically satanic, all about being about themselves and me, me, me, and all this crap.
[00:44:53.305 --> 00:44:54.265]  It's the reason you have nothing.
[00:44:56.479 --> 00:44:58.582]  Because the White House is full of a bunch of trash.
[00:44:59.563 --> 00:45:03.327]  I gotta say it though, the Clintons are even trashier than the Obamas.
[00:45:03.347 --> 00:45:07.933]  They are the trashiest of the trash, just trash upon trash.
[00:45:07.953 --> 00:45:15.582]  So we're gonna be getting to all that, but since I mentioned Gruber,
[00:45:16.735 --> 00:45:18.056]  Here's a mash-up of Gruber.
[00:45:18.076 --> 00:45:20.838]  And of course we have the latest clubs where he just smiles and yells at us.
[00:45:21.059 --> 00:45:21.699]  Get used to it!
[00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:23.461]  Get used to it!
[00:45:23.661 --> 00:45:25.302]  We're just gonna up the penalties.
[00:45:25.502 --> 00:45:26.863]  Remember, there are no penalties.
[00:45:26.924 --> 00:45:38.093]  Every news channel, it's crazy, it's a conspiracy, you're a racist, it was in the bill, they don't care, they passed it, and now they sit there and giggle because they're the Ivy League white shoe boys and laugh at you and your family.
[00:45:38.453 --> 00:45:40.735]  While they try to shut the economy down to consolidate it.
[00:45:41.336 --> 00:45:41.996]  In their own words.
[00:45:42.456 --> 00:45:43.818]  So here's Gruber laughing at you.
[00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:46.191]  Who exactly is Gruber?
[00:45:46.231 --> 00:45:48.313]  What was his role in crafting Obamacare?
[00:45:48.353 --> 00:45:49.234]  I don't know who he is.
[00:45:49.534 --> 00:45:50.635]  He didn't help write our bill.
[00:45:51.115 --> 00:45:55.599]  Most people think that he's one of the best outside experts, Mr. Gruber of MIT.
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:59.883]  I don't know if you have seen Jonathan Gruber of MIT's analysis.
[00:46:01.324 --> 00:46:06.248]  So... Jonathan Gruber is one of the most respected economists in the world.
[00:46:06.729 --> 00:46:14.175]  He attended five of the twelve meetings at the Obama White House in 2009, including the meeting with the president.
[00:46:14.515 --> 00:46:18.938]  I was a paid consultant to the Obama administration to help develop the technical details of the bill.
[00:46:19.058 --> 00:46:22.701]  Six million dollars in consulting fees on Obamacare.
[00:46:22.781 --> 00:46:24.903]  Who knew you could make so much money working for the government, huh?
[00:46:25.143 --> 00:46:26.384]  And... so...
[00:46:27.663 --> 00:46:37.652]  The fact that some advisor, who never worked on our staff, expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with in terms of the voters.
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:49.703]  There's no reflection on the actual process that was run.
[00:47:00.521 --> 00:47:02.942]  And the only way we could take it on was first by mislabeling it.
[00:47:03.482 --> 00:47:06.062]  And John Kerry said, no, no, no, we're going to tax your health insurance.
[00:47:06.082 --> 00:47:08.023]  We're going to tax those evil insurance companies.
[00:47:08.123 --> 00:47:10.663]  Gruber, who has been our guide on a lot of this.
[00:47:10.863 --> 00:47:13.484]  But we all know it's really a tax on people who hold those insurance plans.
[00:47:13.704 --> 00:47:22.586]  I think it's fair to say that there was not a provision in the health care law that was not extensively debated.
[00:47:22.746 --> 00:47:26.886]  This bill was written in a tortured way to make sure CBO did not square the mandate as taxes.
[00:47:27.527 --> 00:47:29.407]  If CBO squared the mandate as taxes, the bill dies.
[00:47:30.339 --> 00:47:31.520]  Mr. Gruber of MIT.
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:41.886]  He's got big computer models, he takes the CBO data, and frankly, in some respects, he's helped CBO by helping giving some information to CBO that otherwise does not have.
[00:47:42.246 --> 00:47:44.608]  He had a law which said healthy people are going to pay in.
[00:47:44.628 --> 00:47:47.329]  It made explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money.
[00:47:47.389 --> 00:47:48.170]  It would not have passed.
[00:47:49.271 --> 00:47:55.938]  And of course he's now back on TV laughing and giggling and saying we're gonna raise your premiums even more and your fines.
[00:48:11.988 --> 00:48:28.218]  But the final lie, even on C-SPAN to his own minions, teaching him how to lie, teaching him how to deceive, teaching him how to engage in fraud and get paid, you know, six million dollars for doing it, is that he keeps saying, so that sick people get health care.
[00:48:28.678 --> 00:48:32.720]  The sick people had charity care, they always did, under state and federal law.
[00:48:33.081 --> 00:48:36.062]  Now they're getting rid of that and the standard of care is going down.
[00:48:36.123 --> 00:48:36.603]  That's a fact.
[00:48:38.993 --> 00:48:40.194]  Doctors are quitting in mass.
[00:48:40.494 --> 00:48:41.334]  We have the emails.
[00:48:41.414 --> 00:48:43.315]  It's meant to bankrupt the system.
[00:48:44.055 --> 00:48:48.637]  So the final lie is, oh, we're lying to the public for the greater good to help poor people.
[00:48:48.697 --> 00:48:50.078]  That's just another lie.
[00:48:51.058 --> 00:48:59.222]  To get the minions in academia and in finance and in the system to go, okay, I'll do bad things for a greater good.
[00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:05.010]  And then in most cases, you're screwing yourself.
[00:49:05.771 --> 00:49:06.591]  That's the big fraud.
[00:49:06.611 --> 00:49:11.132]  We're going to go to break and come back with the actual video of the vote flipping happening in Texas and other states.
[00:49:11.912 --> 00:49:14.993]  I mean, they're saying illegals are voting all over the country.
[00:49:15.033 --> 00:49:18.073]  Cities are just letting people do it, but it doesn't exist.
[00:49:20.474 --> 00:49:25.315]  I mean, this is Heaven's Gate, Hale-Bopp level, Cuckoo-Cocoa-Puff level.
[00:49:27.398 --> 00:49:31.482]  And then I'm sitting here pointing this out, and they just keep saying I'm crazy.
[00:49:31.522 --> 00:49:32.143]  Well, you know what?
[00:49:32.503 --> 00:49:34.445]  You're crazy if you listen to these liars.
[00:49:34.706 --> 00:49:44.296]  When you can read the methodology of the polls, and they're all nine points or more added to Hillary via sampling of Democrats.
[00:49:45.317 --> 00:49:46.598]  I mean, that's not a conspiracy theory.
[00:49:46.839 --> 00:49:47.880]  That's mathematics.
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:48.921]  That's critical thinking.
[00:49:50.987 --> 00:49:54.148]  And the cons just keep telling you, no, no, no, you can't have it that way.
[00:49:54.468 --> 00:49:57.429]  Before we go to break, ladies and gentlemen, we're ending this special at the end of the weekend.
[00:49:57.789 --> 00:49:59.850]  It's an amazing nootropic, so good for your brain.
[00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:00.910]  I absolutely love it.
[00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:02.030]  Much of this crew takes it.
[00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:06.672]  It's BrainForce, available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:50:07.872 --> 00:50:11.333]  That's one word, InfoWarsLife.com, 25% off BrainForce.
[00:50:11.513 --> 00:50:13.294]  And of course, we have the even bigger special, 30 to 40%.
[00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:23.813]  30% is the lowest discount, 40% is the biggest on all the super high quality storable foods at infowarestore.com.
[00:50:25.214 --> 00:50:27.614]  It's powered by My Patriot Supply, the best folks out there.
[00:50:28.215 --> 00:50:29.455]  We have their full catalog as well.
[00:50:29.475 --> 00:50:36.197]  This is the exact same food, packed the exact same time, but I can get around it contractually with private labeling and do these sales occasionally.
[00:50:36.898 --> 00:50:39.779]  This is the best of sales we ever do, upwards of 40%.
[00:50:41.661 --> 00:50:43.363]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:50:44.003 --> 00:50:48.187]  Infowarsstore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:50:48.327 --> 00:50:52.370]  And I'm glad to see a lot of folks are getting storable foods and firearms and things like that.
[00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:54.092]  The numbers show record firearm sales, you name it.
[00:50:54.392 --> 00:50:56.174]  People understand how much danger this country's in.
[00:50:56.774 --> 00:50:57.375]  They're digging in.
[00:50:57.395 --> 00:50:58.656]  They're hoping to fix things peacefully.
[00:50:59.557 --> 00:51:03.400]  But they're canceling school all over the country and stuff on November 8th and November 9th.
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:05.402]  Looks like they're getting ready to really try to stir something up.
[00:51:05.682 --> 00:51:06.843]  We'll be here chronicling it all.
[00:51:07.043 --> 00:51:07.684]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:07.724 --> 00:51:08.324]  Thanks for the support.
[00:51:08.344 --> 00:51:08.725]  We'll be back.
[00:51:11.093 --> 00:51:22.899]  With Mrs. Clinton, if... You know, I got the... What I used to say when I could talk, when I couldn't talk, is that, you know, no matter where we went, she'd come in, she'd be grateful, say thanks.
[00:51:23.219 --> 00:51:26.901]  Thank you to the back of the house, people in the kitchen, etc.
[00:51:27.461 --> 00:51:29.542]  But that was always if there was press around.
[00:51:30.422 --> 00:51:33.364]  She's a completely different person when the camera's not on her.
[00:51:34.484 --> 00:51:35.645]  And I ran into an incident.
[00:51:35.685 --> 00:51:39.007]  I was at the Elizabeth Taylor Medical Center in Washington, D.C.
[00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:45.314]  And we were doing a tea with Mrs. Chirac, the former French President's wife.
[00:51:46.675 --> 00:51:50.638]  And it was just Mrs. Quentin, Mrs. Chirac, and myself in the same room.
[00:51:51.579 --> 00:51:55.302]  And one of the people brought in something, and it did not please her.
[00:51:55.902 --> 00:51:58.204]  And she used the N-word very openly.
[00:51:58.922 --> 00:52:00.703]  Not just gangs of kids anymore.
[00:52:01.063 --> 00:52:04.544]  They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators.
[00:52:04.845 --> 00:52:06.545]  No conscience, no empathy.
[00:52:06.845 --> 00:52:10.687]  We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.
[00:52:11.007 --> 00:52:18.370]  Again, former top chefs of the Clintons, Mr. Martin, can you walk through specifically what was happening in the conversation, what was said?
[00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:22.212]  Well, what had happened with the conversation is
[00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:27.533]  I was just, like I said, Mrs. Chirac, Mrs. Clinton, and myself in there.
[00:52:27.553 --> 00:52:28.994]  I was just serving them tea.
[00:52:29.795 --> 00:52:35.159]  We had somebody bring in something, I think it was like some tea sandwiches or whatever, and it wasn't exactly what she wanted.
[00:52:35.699 --> 00:52:42.604]  So she tells me to tell that N, N-word, to please, you know, leave and get what she wants.
[00:52:43.245 --> 00:52:44.646]  I mean, that's very common.
[00:52:45.219 --> 00:52:47.000]  Not just gangs of kids anymore.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:50.841]  They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators.
[00:52:51.141 --> 00:52:52.842]  No conscience, no empathy.
[00:52:53.142 --> 00:52:56.983]  We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.
[00:52:57.003 --> 00:53:08.748]  I mean, just the demeanor and, you know, and, you know, she would write things down like that to, you know, she has so many handlers.
[00:53:08.788 --> 00:53:14.490]  And when I worked, when I worked for them in Washington, I used to think to myself, you know, because the,
[00:53:15.499 --> 00:53:18.423]  Parties aside, I thought, you know, this is great.
[00:53:18.483 --> 00:53:21.267]  I'm a kid that grew up on a small farm in Chautauqua County.
[00:53:22.008 --> 00:53:25.073]  And here I am, working for the free leader of the world.
[00:53:25.914 --> 00:53:30.821]  So you sort of out, you know, you don't look at this other small stuff and then one day you realize, you know,
[00:53:31.576 --> 00:53:32.917]  They're really terrible people.
[00:53:33.278 --> 00:53:36.761]  They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators.
[00:53:36.921 --> 00:53:38.262]  We have to bring them to heel.
[00:53:38.382 --> 00:53:40.604]  Wow, so just be clear, Tracy Martin.
[00:53:40.624 --> 00:53:42.926]  She's not going to do us any better.
[00:53:42.946 --> 00:53:54.296]  I mean, she tells us one thing, she does something totally opposite, and now with all the WikiLeaks information coming out, everything that I've said for the last few years is all proven.
[00:53:54.716 --> 00:53:57.159]  Just like Donald Trump has said, it's all coming out.
[00:53:58.195 --> 00:54:04.780]  So, I think we've got a very, uh... I think we've got somebody saying here, we have to bring them to heel.
[00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:06.681]  Okay, we'll talk about it.
[00:54:06.781 --> 00:54:09.063]  I'm not a super predator, Hillary.
[00:54:09.163 --> 00:54:10.764]  Okay, we have to bring them to heel.
[00:54:14.415 --> 00:54:17.056]  So, we have new national polls out.
[00:54:17.256 --> 00:54:22.319]  Public faith in elections falls to all-time lows from the Mises Institute.
[00:54:23.259 --> 00:54:26.281]  We have Putin mocks Clinton claim of Russian election meddling.
[00:54:26.581 --> 00:54:27.121]  Is the U.S.
[00:54:27.161 --> 00:54:28.061]  a banana republic?
[00:54:28.422 --> 00:54:31.463]  Meanwhile, they're bringing in the EU and UN to oversee our elections.
[00:54:31.963 --> 00:54:33.104]  Oh, foreigners are running things!
[00:54:33.144 --> 00:54:34.004]  Bring in the UN!
[00:54:34.905 --> 00:54:37.426]  Everything they accuse Russia of, they're doing.
[00:54:38.326 --> 00:54:41.828]  Everything they accuse the patriots of, or Trump, they're doing.
[00:54:43.814 --> 00:54:51.880]  But more and more, everywhere CNN goes, the crowds are calling them out, their guests are calling them out, that they're the Clinton News Network, that they're despicable.
[00:54:53.401 --> 00:54:58.444]  So the good news is, they can try to sit here in Stonewall and say, we don't know what's going on, the truth is coming out.
[00:54:58.504 --> 00:55:13.295]  Now the Democrats, back in 2008, ran a voting machine comedy piece via the Simpsons, where they're trying to vote for Obama, but they keep getting McCain.
[00:55:15.129 --> 00:55:15.890]  Over and over again.
[00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:19.233]  This vote flipping was known to be carried out by both parties.
[00:55:19.633 --> 00:55:20.414]  It's been certified.
[00:55:20.434 --> 00:55:22.115]  There's been congressional investigations.
[00:55:22.135 --> 00:55:24.517]  They just know the general public doesn't look into stuff like that.
[00:55:26.138 --> 00:55:30.962]  Hell, they can tell the public Congress is a conspiracy theory and it doesn't exist and people would buy it.
[00:55:31.183 --> 00:55:31.383]  At least 30%.
[00:55:31.463 --> 00:55:33.545]  I mean, I'm not kidding at this point.
[00:55:34.245 --> 00:55:36.147]  They're now demonizing the word mother and father.
[00:55:37.308 --> 00:55:38.549]  They mean business, folks.
[00:55:38.589 --> 00:55:40.190]  They are taking over reality.
[00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.991]  We're in a total war.
[00:55:43.075 --> 00:55:52.623]  So here they are saying it's a big problem on the Simpsons, but now no one ever heard of it as state election officials are saying, we've certified in Texas and other states, they're flipping.
[00:55:53.064 --> 00:55:56.267]  And they certified in Illinois and Colorado and everywhere else that illegals are voting.
[00:55:56.707 --> 00:55:57.688]  And dead people are voting.
[00:55:57.708 --> 00:56:00.250]  And they're trying to get illegals to be able to vote.
[00:56:00.310 --> 00:56:03.533]  I mean, we're going to get illegals to vote, but it doesn't exist.
[00:56:04.714 --> 00:56:08.097]  Trump's completely insane saying illegals are voting, but we are having them vote, though.
[00:56:09.502 --> 00:56:11.423]  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[00:56:11.564 --> 00:56:12.224]  Shame article.
[00:56:12.424 --> 00:56:13.165]  Just read it again.
[00:56:13.685 --> 00:56:15.547]  They're assaulting your reason.
[00:56:15.567 --> 00:56:16.647]  You're like, this discredits them.
[00:56:17.188 --> 00:56:23.192]  They just want to keep programming you with a psychological warfare tactic to basically just create mass mental illness.
[00:56:24.453 --> 00:56:26.114]  And think they've got our kids in the schools, folks.
[00:56:27.095 --> 00:56:27.816]  So you're an adult.
[00:56:27.856 --> 00:56:30.418]  You can barely, you know, decipher it.
[00:56:30.438 --> 00:56:31.258]  It's the same here with me.
[00:56:31.318 --> 00:56:31.799]  It's crazy.
[00:56:32.479 --> 00:56:33.480]  Garbage in, garbage out.
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:34.621]  But imagine your kids.
[00:56:34.881 --> 00:56:36.142]  So here's the Homer Simpson piece.
[00:56:40.979 --> 00:56:41.680]  To the voting booth.
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:44.461]  One of those electronic voting dealies.
[00:56:44.962 --> 00:56:46.363]  One vote for McCain.
[00:56:46.603 --> 00:56:47.083]  Thank you.
[00:56:48.564 --> 00:56:50.645]  No, I want to vote for Obama.
[00:56:50.685 --> 00:56:52.166]  Two votes for McCain.
[00:56:52.186 --> 00:56:54.848]  Come on, it's time for a change.
[00:56:55.208 --> 00:56:56.829]  Three votes for McCain.
[00:56:56.849 --> 00:56:58.030]  No, no, no!
[00:56:58.250 --> 00:57:00.492]  Six votes for President McCain.
[00:57:00.712 --> 00:57:03.093]  Hey, I only meant one of those votes for McCain.
[00:57:03.634 --> 00:57:04.935]  This machine is rigged!
[00:57:06.696 --> 00:57:06.876]  Good.
[00:57:08.007 --> 00:57:10.469]  Must tell President McCain!
[00:57:10.489 --> 00:57:12.810]  It doesn't happen in America!
[00:57:12.991 --> 00:57:14.912]  Maybe Ohio, but not in America!
[00:57:14.972 --> 00:57:16.293]  Oh, it doesn't happen in America?
[00:57:16.313 --> 00:57:17.134]  Obama said so!
[00:57:21.416 --> 00:57:21.837]  I voted!
[00:57:23.018 --> 00:57:24.258]  Okay, so there they are.
[00:57:25.079 --> 00:57:26.760]  But now, it doesn't exist.
[00:57:27.741 --> 00:57:28.401]  But here's some video.
[00:57:28.421 --> 00:57:33.205]  Voting machine caught on camera casting ballot for Democrat when selecting Republican in Texas.
[00:57:33.225 --> 00:57:34.426]  This is from Today's News.
[00:57:34.446 --> 00:57:34.726]  Here it is.
[00:57:39.172 --> 00:57:39.933]  This is what it's doing.
[00:57:43.475 --> 00:57:51.521]  And 16 states, I think 60%, 16 states are basically run on George Soros' own machines, and he's got connections to several of the other big companies.
[00:57:51.961 --> 00:57:54.743]  But it's okay to have a weirdo Nazi collaborator running our voting.
[00:57:58.706 --> 00:58:02.149]  So basically, the Democrats have gone pure criminal with the Republican leadership.
[00:58:03.143 --> 00:58:03.943]  against the American people.
[00:58:03.983 --> 00:58:05.724]  They've just dropped any pretense.
[00:58:05.844 --> 00:58:07.264]  They are absolutely against us.
[00:58:07.544 --> 00:58:11.005]  They're in a war, and the WikiLeaks admits they're in a war against you.
[00:58:12.966 --> 00:58:14.166]  It's a scorched-earth policy.
[00:58:14.206 --> 00:58:17.087]  You've got all these yuppies and people that have two or three degrees, no future.
[00:58:17.327 --> 00:58:21.928]  All they're told is be partisan, totalitarianism, learn to lie to the public, rubric of seminars on it.
[00:58:22.328 --> 00:58:23.388]  We're going to rob everybody.
[00:58:23.428 --> 00:58:24.909]  And so they're like, okay, I'm ready to rob.
[00:58:26.109 --> 00:58:28.850]  And they actually get off on the criminal activity.
[00:58:30.533 --> 00:58:32.214]  And they're very sophisticated, folks.
[00:58:32.254 --> 00:58:36.996]  They wear trendy clothes, they look completely nice and normal, but they are scientific.
[00:58:37.016 --> 00:58:39.317]  Let me tell you, even the mid-level, you've seen the behind-the-scenes videos.
[00:58:39.638 --> 00:58:41.138]  These are military operations.
[00:58:42.379 --> 00:58:46.141]  I mean, these corporations even have people broken down and sometimes under military titles.
[00:58:46.801 --> 00:58:48.262]  I mean, they are bringing us down.
[00:58:48.622 --> 00:58:50.263]  This is 21st century warfare.
[00:58:50.483 --> 00:58:51.263]  We're under attack.
[00:58:51.343 --> 00:58:52.204]  Mayday worldwide.
[00:58:52.484 --> 00:58:53.625]  Mayday, mayday, mayday.
[00:58:53.825 --> 00:58:55.045]  For God's sakes, awaken.
[00:58:55.385 --> 00:58:56.326]  We'll be back with our tune.
[00:58:56.346 --> 00:58:58.147]  GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:01.980]  We're red on election day.
[00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:05.081]  Perhaps the biggest election in American history is just days away.
[00:59:05.221 --> 00:59:09.803]  We know that in past elections, there have been thousands of cases of voter fraud and election fraud.
[00:59:09.843 --> 00:59:17.065]  From dead people voting, to people registering false identifications, to government leaders providing fast-track amnesty to give illegal immigrants votes.
[00:59:17.245 --> 00:59:18.726]  This is happening right in front of us.
[00:59:18.926 --> 00:59:23.327]  Now we are seeing the establishment send all its hitmen after the Republican nominee, Donald Trump.
[00:59:23.387 --> 00:59:25.309]  Government shills are campaigning for Clinton.
[00:59:25.409 --> 00:59:28.592]  Mainstream news attacking Donald Trump all day like rabbit hounds.
[00:59:28.772 --> 00:59:35.518]  Rigged polls being broadcast daily to provide the fake optics that Hillary Clinton is actually winning and to discourage people from voting Trump.
[00:59:35.638 --> 00:59:38.200]  Fake celebrities endorsing Clinton across all platforms.
[00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:41.643]  So with all this, what are we doing to keep this election from being stolen?
[00:59:41.883 --> 00:59:43.744]  What can we do to prevent election fraud?
[00:59:43.884 --> 00:59:46.985]  I propose that all Donald Trump supporters wear red on election day.
[00:59:47.105 --> 00:59:50.887]  On November 8th, when you head to the polls to vote Donald Trump, be decked out in red.
[00:59:50.967 --> 00:59:57.010]  This way, just as we dominated in rally turnout, we can prove and provide the optics that we also dominated in voter turnout.
[00:59:57.110 --> 01:00:00.051]  Wear red on election day and make America great again!
[01:00:03.353 --> 01:00:05.954]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:13.083 --> 01:00:15.825]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:00:15.845 --> 01:00:19.729]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:28.536]  You know, I love how Project Veritas actually gets the undercover video that mirrors what the WikiLeaks show, and Hillary doesn't even deny these are real.
[01:00:29.137 --> 01:00:33.761]  They've got data dump, whatever it is today, with new incredible revelations coming out.
[01:00:34.702 --> 01:00:35.763]  But look at DrugsReport.com.
[01:00:37.932 --> 01:00:43.096]  Talk about in real time as we're breaking all this down, drudges, you know, on top of it and even finding stuff we didn't find.
[01:00:43.616 --> 01:00:44.897]  Cities push for illegals to vote.
[01:00:44.917 --> 01:00:45.617]  We were covering that.
[01:00:45.657 --> 01:00:46.878]  That's Bloomberg, how great it is.
[01:00:47.759 --> 01:00:49.400]  Dead cast ballots in Chicago.
[01:00:50.041 --> 01:00:51.482]  From the grave in Philly.
[01:00:52.722 --> 01:00:53.843]  Vote flipping Maryland.
[01:00:54.404 --> 01:00:55.664]  Election fraud Florida.
[01:00:56.425 --> 01:00:58.006]  Fake registration Virginia.
[01:00:58.546 --> 01:01:00.228]  And this is all documented.
[01:01:01.311 --> 01:01:03.151]  And that's just the last hour's news.
[01:01:03.792 --> 01:01:12.434]  The problem is there's literally, I don't want to exaggerate, a hundred or more articles a day with election officials, you name it, certifying that all over the country they're flipping to Hillary.
[01:01:13.554 --> 01:01:16.535]  By the way, I'm not somebody that's hype-driven, everybody knows that.
[01:01:16.595 --> 01:01:17.795]  I really go with what the truth is.
[01:01:18.656 --> 01:01:22.877]  I almost said this a few weeks ago, but I didn't because it wasn't overwhelming.
[01:01:23.817 --> 01:01:25.017]  It is now overwhelming.
[01:01:25.037 --> 01:01:27.318]  I have Democrats, because Austin's mainly a Democrat city.
[01:01:28.496 --> 01:01:39.767]  Come up and apologize, whisper to me that they're really supporting Trump, they understand what's happening, they're scared she's going to start a war, they understand she's part of the mafia, on and on and on, and that all the Democrats they know are actually voting for Trump.
[01:01:41.089 --> 01:01:51.199]  And then I hear that on talk radio, I see it all over, my parents' friends, I'd say 70% of them are liberals, and they're nice people, they're old-fashioned liberals, you know.
[01:01:52.594 --> 01:01:53.815]  They're all for Trump.
[01:01:53.835 --> 01:01:55.635]  I mean, they're just like, cannot stand Hillary.
[01:01:55.675 --> 01:01:58.957]  And I just started really thinking and talking to other folks around the country.
[01:01:59.737 --> 01:02:01.398]  I was talking to Daria, whose parents live in New York.
[01:02:01.438 --> 01:02:02.378]  They say everybody's for Trump.
[01:02:02.398 --> 01:02:03.739]  They don't know anyone that's for Hillary.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.180]  Unless you go to the richest neighborhoods, and then that's it.
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:08.841]  I mean, it's just, it's so elitist.
[01:02:08.901 --> 01:02:12.083]  And I'm not against the wealthy, but she's starting a class war.
[01:02:12.803 --> 01:02:16.124]  She's part of the crony elite that don't want a free market.
[01:02:16.665 --> 01:02:21.927]  And then they've got the nerve to bad mouth money all day when these are pigs that steal the money from the Haitians.
[01:02:24.889 --> 01:02:29.231]  And it's time for all the black organizations and others, I mean, after the robbery of Haiti of billions, to go public.
[01:02:30.132 --> 01:02:30.752]  To go public.
[01:02:31.833 --> 01:02:36.955]  Against Hillary, I mean, there's never been a clearer choice here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:37.616 --> 01:02:37.816]  Never.
[01:02:38.776 --> 01:02:40.958]  It's so incredibly clear, I don't even know what to say at this point.
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:50.943]  But continuing, eight points vanish in four days, even in her staged polls.
[01:02:51.243 --> 01:02:52.704]  70% of her supporters want Obama
[01:02:55.725 --> 01:02:56.725]  That's right, they don't want her.
[01:02:57.406 --> 01:02:59.066]  AI predicts Trump win.
[01:02:59.086 --> 01:03:00.246]  I should have pointed that out.
[01:03:00.847 --> 01:03:02.787]  That's what I keep breaking down for everybody.
[01:03:03.007 --> 01:03:04.068]  That's out of CNBC.
[01:03:04.668 --> 01:03:05.728]  It's the Google bots.
[01:03:05.828 --> 01:03:07.549]  It's the big corporate bots.
[01:03:07.649 --> 01:03:15.671]  It's what's in the subscription business journals that are all on board for centralized government and want Hillary because they've already got the system rigged.
[01:03:15.931 --> 01:03:18.512]  But they admit, oh my God, we've got to fight hard.
[01:03:18.832 --> 01:03:19.993]  Trump is going to have a tsunami.
[01:03:20.373 --> 01:03:21.053]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:03:22.188 --> 01:03:34.774]  If you go to Google searches alone, on average Trump's got 20 plus times the searchability of Hillary, and then you look at the positive metrics, it's 10 times or more.
[01:03:35.194 --> 01:03:42.178]  I mean, this really spells gargantuan tsunami insane asylum level victory for Trump.
[01:03:43.868 --> 01:03:46.970]  And they've got everybody convinced with oversampling that he's in a dead heat with her.
[01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:48.931]  So they can try to steal this thing.
[01:03:49.211 --> 01:03:53.814]  And they want Trump to sit there, like Bernie Sanders did, and just accept them stealing the nomination.
[01:03:53.834 --> 01:03:54.334]  He didn't do it.
[01:03:54.674 --> 01:03:55.795]  Trump knows he's got to fight.
[01:03:56.075 --> 01:03:57.096]  He knows this is coming.
[01:03:57.716 --> 01:03:58.677]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:03:58.777 --> 01:03:59.978]  They're going to rig the election.
[01:04:00.618 --> 01:04:01.378]  We have them!
[01:04:01.659 --> 01:04:02.939]  We have them in the WikiLeaks!
[01:04:03.179 --> 01:04:04.380]  We have them on the polls!
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.061]  We have them on the ground!
[01:04:06.281 --> 01:04:10.263]  We have their national directors from every frickin' angle, man!
[01:04:10.723 --> 01:04:11.544]  Open and shut!
[01:04:11.584 --> 01:04:21.449]  There isn't a jury in the world wouldn't lock their asses up if we had real prosecutors in this country that weren't political hacks.
[01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:26.651]  And I understand that they're controlled by people on top.
[01:04:26.671 --> 01:04:27.652]  A lot of them are not bad people.
[01:04:27.672 --> 01:04:28.592]  That's why we're seeing all these leaks.
[01:04:28.612 --> 01:04:29.733]  The leaks are not from the Russians.
[01:04:30.802 --> 01:04:32.163]  I mean, some of them have been.
[01:04:32.203 --> 01:04:33.244]  A very small percentage.
[01:04:33.725 --> 01:04:35.286]  The Russians, when they leak something, admit it.
[01:04:37.348 --> 01:04:38.028]  Like Climategate.
[01:04:38.229 --> 01:04:45.175]  Okay, thank God we learned the UN was over a thousand universities hiding the decline and fixing the numbers to get carbon taxes.
[01:04:45.235 --> 01:04:45.915]  Thank you, Russia.
[01:04:47.997 --> 01:04:49.498]  Russia doesn't want a bunch of carbon taxes.
[01:04:50.019 --> 01:04:51.460]  They're about to collapse, just like we are.
[01:04:52.741 --> 01:04:53.482]  So yeah, they did that.
[01:04:53.762 --> 01:04:54.302]  This other stuff?
[01:04:55.322 --> 01:04:59.047]  Just like William Binney told you six months ago, it's coming from U.S.
[01:04:59.428 --> 01:05:03.454]  intelligence agencies that have some shred of sanity left in their minds.
[01:05:03.474 --> 01:05:06.698]  All right, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:06.839 --> 01:05:09.703]  The Big AI Systems Show, whopping victory for Trump.
[01:05:11.718 --> 01:05:17.502]  In this new tell-all expose, find out the identities of the Clinton's multi-million dollar donors.
[01:05:18.022 --> 01:05:22.185]  Like the Sultan of Brunei, who maintains a harem of underage girls.
[01:05:22.725 --> 01:05:25.888]  The Clinton's War on Women, in stores now.
[01:05:26.348 --> 01:05:29.030]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see I told you so.
[01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:32.212]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[01:05:32.232 --> 01:05:33.393]  Because it's already here.
[01:05:33.793 --> 01:05:34.373]  It's being announced.
[01:05:34.794 --> 01:05:38.256]  The way you keep the internet open and free, is you get involved more than ever.
[01:05:38.676 --> 01:05:40.578]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:05:40.719 --> 01:05:42.280]  A new battleship in the fight.
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:43.442]  InfoWars Live.
[01:05:43.662 --> 01:05:44.483]  Available right now.
[01:05:44.743 --> 01:05:46.525]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[01:05:46.545 --> 01:05:48.928]  You gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[01:05:48.948 --> 01:05:50.550]  Or you gonna be part of history?
[01:05:51.110 --> 01:05:54.093]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[01:05:54.614 --> 01:05:55.195]  Take action!
[01:05:56.008 --> 01:06:03.498]  In 1993, Hillary Clinton ordered Vince Foster's dead body to be moved and dumped to avoid a murder investigation.
[01:06:03.819 --> 01:06:07.343]  New York Times bestselling author Roger Stone names names.
[01:06:07.704 --> 01:06:09.166]  The Clintons War on Women.
[01:06:09.526 --> 01:06:10.447]  In stores now.
[01:06:10.828 --> 01:06:18.214]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:06:18.714 --> 01:06:26.361]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[01:06:26.641 --> 01:06:28.722]  As president, I will make it clear.
[01:06:29.603 --> 01:06:34.327]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[01:06:34.907 --> 01:06:40.271]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[01:06:40.331 --> 01:06:43.433]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[01:06:43.893 --> 01:06:46.675]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[01:06:46.735 --> 01:06:49.297]  We came, we saw, he died.
[01:06:51.690 --> 01:06:53.732]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[01:06:54.072 --> 01:06:57.396]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[01:06:57.756 --> 01:07:05.644]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[01:07:07.557 --> 01:07:08.037]  The U.S.
[01:07:08.077 --> 01:07:11.699]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:19.664]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[01:07:20.044 --> 01:07:22.586]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[01:07:22.746 --> 01:07:25.607]  Of course not, because she's... There's a really loud noise.
[01:07:27.048 --> 01:07:31.131]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[01:07:31.151 --> 01:07:33.352]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[01:07:37.202 --> 01:07:41.632]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:08:17.844 --> 01:08:20.685]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:47.526 --> 01:08:51.708]  It doesn't matter what the frickin' legal and ethics people say.
[01:08:52.188 --> 01:08:53.709]  We need to win this mother****er.
[01:08:53.869 --> 01:08:56.291]  Hillary, like, is aware of all the work that you guys do.
[01:08:56.351 --> 01:08:56.851]  I hope.
[01:08:56.871 --> 01:08:58.772]  The campaign is fully in the works.
[01:08:59.112 --> 01:09:00.953]  And then they tell Hillary, like, what's going on.
[01:09:01.013 --> 01:09:03.054]  Well, I mean, Hillary knows she's in command.
[01:09:03.154 --> 01:09:03.454]  Yeah.
[01:09:03.814 --> 01:09:05.335]  I'm not suggesting we wait around.
[01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:07.316]  We need to start this **** right away.
[01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:07.957]  Okay.
[01:09:08.157 --> 01:09:09.317]  On every one of these fronts.
[01:09:09.437 --> 01:09:09.738]  Okay.
[01:09:09.858 --> 01:09:11.498]  What I call this conflict engagement,
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.963]  That's your version of re-enfranchisement.
[01:09:16.003 --> 01:09:18.665]  We're starting anarchy here.
[01:09:24.656 --> 01:09:31.518]  This is part one of our undercover investigation into the dark, backroom dealings of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.
[01:09:32.078 --> 01:09:38.540]  The culmination of a year-long investigation infiltrating the machine from the bottom all the way to the White House.
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:41.301]  There are concerns this election will be rigged.
[01:09:41.941 --> 01:09:45.142]  What you're about to see will make you uncomfortable and angry.
[01:09:45.862 --> 01:09:49.103]  It's graphic, uncensored, and disturbing.
[01:09:49.863 --> 01:09:52.844]  Our attorneys say there is strong evidence of criminality.
[01:09:53.664 --> 01:10:03.411]  And this is just part one.
[01:10:03.551 --> 01:10:09.595]  So I'm basically Deputy Rapid Response Director for the DNC for all things Trump on the ground.
[01:10:09.976 --> 01:10:11.557]  Nobody's really supposed to know about me.
[01:10:12.677 --> 01:10:17.541]  You gotta say, we have mentally ill people and we pay to do sh**.
[01:10:17.581 --> 01:10:18.261]  Make no mistake.
[01:10:18.301 --> 01:10:19.522]  It's gonna be Caesar Bargains.
[01:10:21.705 --> 01:10:24.568]  I got a priest to cry on camera once.
[01:10:24.688 --> 01:10:36.859]  You know, Brad and Bob and Lux and myself are all part of the old school method where it doesn't matter what the freaking legal and ethics people say.
[01:10:37.279 --> 01:10:38.520]  We need to win this mother******.
[01:10:39.581 --> 01:10:47.408]  So Bob is really good friends with them and talked to him this afternoon and they're all in if we can get 25 grand they're all in.
[01:10:49.301 --> 01:10:56.289]  There is a narrative that supporters at Trump rallies are violent and dangerous, looking to beat up protesters who don't agree with them.
[01:10:57.150 --> 01:11:03.238]  But our undercover investigation of the Hillary Clinton Democratic Party machine reveals a very different story.
[01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:09.490]  If you're there, and you're protesting, and you do these actions, you will be attacked at Trump rallies.
[01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:10.891]  That's what we know.
[01:11:11.031 --> 01:11:14.713]  Oh, so that's part of the process of eliciting the reaction.
[01:11:14.733 --> 01:11:22.319]  The point of it is we know that Trump's people will freak the f*** out, his security team will freak out, and his supporters will lose their s***.
[01:11:22.799 --> 01:11:23.820]  This is Scott Fovle.
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:27.182]  He is the National Field Director for Americans United for Change.
[01:11:27.862 --> 01:11:32.205]  He used to work for People for the American Way, an organization funded by George Soros.
[01:11:32.985 --> 01:11:35.266]  He also has his own company, called the Fovle Group.
[01:11:35.947 --> 01:11:38.768]  He is one of the dark operatives for the Clinton campaign.
[01:11:39.089 --> 01:11:41.010]  It doesn't matter what the frickin...
[01:11:42.335 --> 01:11:46.717]  Now, the reason I wanted to start this hour with that information is a fellow has visited me here in Austin.
[01:11:46.737 --> 01:11:48.398]  I've been on his station for many years.
[01:11:48.438 --> 01:11:49.338]  He's the general manager there.
[01:11:49.898 --> 01:11:52.640]  Matt Dubiel's a father, a patriot.
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:55.181]  His videos went the most viral.
[01:11:55.221 --> 01:11:56.581]  Tens of millions of views total.
[01:11:56.982 --> 01:11:59.563]  That's not even counting when they aired on CNN, Fox, you name it.
[01:12:00.003 --> 01:12:08.530]  When he was there with his family and was just trying to go see Trump and saw police being beat up, citizens being attacked, Trump supporters being beaten, women being beaten up by men.
[01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:14.375]  I mean, imagine if Trump people did this and he got a lot of the different videos inside and outside.
[01:12:14.395 --> 01:12:23.423]  Now remember, back when this happened, back in March, six months ago or more, the media said Trump people were attacking.
[01:12:24.682 --> 01:12:26.123]  Sanders, folks.
[01:12:26.263 --> 01:12:45.492]  But we later had our Chicago Police Department source, days after I talked to Matt, confirm this, Stone had another source confirming it, that they had moveon.org buses, it's now come out in the WikiLeaks, and other documents, as well as what Project Veritas got, coming in dressed up like Sanders supporters.
[01:12:45.952 --> 01:12:49.774]  They were hiring mentally ill people, drug addicts, giving them sometimes $1,200 a day
[01:12:52.426 --> 01:12:53.947]  But they had to go get in a fight.
[01:12:53.967 --> 01:12:59.449]  A couple hundred bucks, Jack Daniels, vodka, drugs, this has all come out.
[01:13:00.569 --> 01:13:02.970]  But you gotta go knock somebody upside the head.
[01:13:04.351 --> 01:13:09.913]  And the bird-doggy is you go up and you hit them below in a crowd so people don't see what's happening.
[01:13:09.933 --> 01:13:12.054]  And I've had anarchists do this to me, communists do it.
[01:13:12.074 --> 01:13:16.095]  They'll come up and hit you in the back and then wait for you to turn around and knock them upside the head so they can get you arrested.
[01:13:16.736 --> 01:13:19.437]  So this is how they operate, ladies and gentlemen, and I've dealt with it.
[01:13:20.626 --> 01:13:23.987]  So many times I've had these people hit me in the ribs, and I know full well I'm getting set up.
[01:13:24.067 --> 01:13:28.408]  Or they, you know, scream, kill Michelle Malkin, and then I wasn't saying it, and then say I was saying it.
[01:13:28.648 --> 01:13:30.409]  I mean, they're very sophisticated.
[01:13:31.289 --> 01:13:33.349]  Thank God we had video that I wasn't the one saying it, though.
[01:13:33.850 --> 01:13:35.510]  So that big national attack piece fell apart.
[01:13:35.530 --> 01:13:38.811]  But I've had them try this on me at least five times, setting me up in crowds.
[01:13:39.682 --> 01:13:44.745]  Okay, so the good news is the police, they're not perfect, nobody is, but they're on to these scams.
[01:13:45.766 --> 01:13:51.150]  So we're going to go to Matt Dubiel, until about 45 after, because I want to set this up though, we're going to hear him in a few minutes.
[01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:55.733]  He's the Vice President and General Manager of WCKG Radio in Chicago, 1530.
[01:13:57.054 --> 01:14:04.599]  Most recently he made, again, national headlines on Drudge, Fox & Friends, Inside Edition, CNN, for his criticism of the TSA screening of his three-year-old son, and then of course
[01:14:06.724 --> 01:14:12.886]  More recently, with the whole situation at the Trump rally in Chicago, which was the beginning of our investigation.
[01:14:13.166 --> 01:14:19.789]  But what's amazing is everything he said has now come true, and here's Donald Trump in the last debate calling Hillary out for it.
[01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:22.590]  Those people, I don't know those people.
[01:14:23.010 --> 01:14:24.351]  I have a feeling how they came.
[01:14:24.431 --> 01:14:26.131]  I believe it was her campaign that did it.
[01:14:26.191 --> 01:14:36.213]  Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence.
[01:14:37.353 --> 01:14:39.853]  She's the one in Obama that caused the violence.
[01:14:40.253 --> 01:14:48.035]  They hired people, they paid them $1,500 and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.
[01:14:49.841 --> 01:14:51.902]  There you go, and he goes on to point out what she's doing is criminal.
[01:14:51.922 --> 01:14:57.826]  Now the reason I wanted to play that is this is a big national issue now, one of the chief issues of the dirtiness of that rat Hillary.
[01:14:58.186 --> 01:15:07.772]  Now here's Matt, right after it happened, breaking down the evidence that it was MoveOn.org, George Soros, Hillary, and the whole setup, now proven completely accurate.
[01:15:09.704 --> 01:15:11.846]  Folks, we're like accurate 99% of the time.
[01:15:11.906 --> 01:15:13.627]  It's ridiculous how on target we are.
[01:15:14.107 --> 01:15:17.130]  That's why major intelligence agencies around the world listen, not just the U.S.
[01:15:17.150 --> 01:15:17.450]  government.
[01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:30.340]  That's why people all over the planet listen to InfoWars because we've done the research and it's important that we point that out because this broadcast has the talking points and the information that will bring these people down.
[01:15:30.641 --> 01:15:33.383]  So here's Matt back in March right after the staged riots.
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:37.082]  This is what they're not really talking about at that event.
[01:15:37.162 --> 01:15:45.088]  It was a peaceful event until the moment when they announced that it was cancelled or postponed for safety concerns.
[01:15:45.508 --> 01:15:50.612]  And then you saw all the people that were in the crowd that were virtually sleeper cells.
[01:15:51.212 --> 01:15:53.913]  And I don't want to use that term because I know that they weren't- No, that's what it is.
[01:15:53.933 --> 01:15:55.214]  They're hired by George Soros.
[01:15:55.254 --> 01:15:56.054]  He's taking credit.
[01:15:56.614 --> 01:15:58.635]  Hillary, and they're blaming Sanders.
[01:15:58.695 --> 01:15:59.255]  It's incredible.
[01:15:59.295 --> 01:16:00.276]  They paid him to do it.
[01:16:00.736 --> 01:16:01.636]  They're under orders.
[01:16:01.676 --> 01:16:02.516]  They're mercenaries.
[01:16:03.377 --> 01:16:04.957]  And they go in and they do this.
[01:16:05.337 --> 01:16:08.379]  And as soon as they knew that happened, okay, now we're not going to disrupt Trump.
[01:16:09.059 --> 01:16:11.740]  Now we're going to activate because our threats worked, shut it down.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:19.063]  And now we're going to cause a melee so they can run headlines saying the most dangerous place to be in the world is a Trump rally for a chilling effect.
[01:16:20.672 --> 01:16:26.658]  Okay, so going to Matt Dubiel of WCKG.com, 1530 AM there in Chicago.
[01:16:27.539 --> 01:16:39.231]  The reason this is important is they tried to cover it up, it's all come out, and it's all over mainstream news today that Hillary has failed, and the media has failed, they're all very down on themselves, to suppress the emails, and it's really hurting Hillary.
[01:16:40.012 --> 01:16:47.239]  So isn't that just terrible that they've failed in their criminal conspiracy against the American people?
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:48.841]  Matt, great to have you on with us.
[01:16:49.462 --> 01:16:50.543]  Alex, thanks for having me.
[01:16:51.203 --> 01:16:57.289]  I want to really express some gratitude for what you do and for InfoWars, because without you,
[01:16:57.870 --> 01:17:08.057]  And I'm not, I mean this from my heart, without you and without these stories being told, I cannot imagine what kind of election this would be.
[01:17:08.157 --> 01:17:15.842]  I cannot imagine what kind of country we would be where the lies are allowed to go on and the bullies are allowed to keep on bullying.
[01:17:16.102 --> 01:17:19.104]  I mean, imagine the Project Veritas videos.
[01:17:19.284 --> 01:17:25.086]  I didn't know about them until your organization, InfoWars, started talking about them.
[01:17:25.427 --> 01:17:28.948]  And because you started talking about them, we started talking about them.
[01:17:29.068 --> 01:17:34.931]  And because of that, my cell phone's blowing up because I used to work with the guy on the video.
[01:17:35.431 --> 01:17:39.312]  And then I'm going, oh my gosh, look at all these pieces we put together.
[01:17:39.693 --> 01:17:45.215]  And then you see presidential candidate Donald Trump, who, I gotta say, on the debate,
[01:17:45.495 --> 01:18:03.248]  He was very presidential, because if it were me on the debate stage, having personally been in Chicago and seen the evil that rooted itself, and I will call them sleeper cells now, because those people and the people behind this are terrorists, they should be brought up on domestic terrorism charges.
[01:18:03.769 --> 01:18:06.411]  Well, they're involved in racketeering to suppress our free speech.
[01:18:07.151 --> 01:18:12.473]  It's criminal, it is deplorable, and it's disgusting, frankly.
[01:18:12.753 --> 01:18:16.115]  I can't believe that Trump handled himself the way he did.
[01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:18.276]  Oh, he just gets more presidential as he goes.
[01:18:18.296 --> 01:18:25.979]  But just to expand on that, with Drudge and Veritas and all of us in local stations feeding the intel in, that's why we're giving them a major run for their money.
[01:18:26.019 --> 01:18:27.999]  And they're seriously panicking.
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:36.403]  I totally agree with you, but the fact that we're bringing this back up and Obamacare back up just is more of the greatest lies, the greatest hits they've been involved in.
[01:18:37.369 --> 01:18:40.852]  The truth, this is the beauty of freedom of speech.
[01:18:40.912 --> 01:18:42.633]  This is why you let people talk.
[01:18:42.693 --> 01:18:50.119]  This is why you let people speak, let people speak their mind, because smart people will figure out what is garbage and what is real.
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:59.727]  You don't want to suppress opposing ideas, you want to let them talk, because the more you let them talk, the more criminals will be seen for the criminals they are, and shady people will be found out.
[01:18:59.747 --> 01:19:03.530]  I'm glad you say that, because we invite socialists, globalists, liberals on all the time.
[01:19:05.191 --> 01:19:05.652]  99 times out of 100.
[01:19:05.692 --> 01:19:06.812]  I mean literally.
[01:19:07.613 --> 01:19:09.394]  Maybe 1 out of 200 times will they come on.
[01:19:09.734 --> 01:19:12.756]  They will not defend themselves because they're all following talking points.
[01:19:13.416 --> 01:19:15.658]  I've seen a thousand articles last week attacking me.
[01:19:15.758 --> 01:19:16.318]  Over a thousand.
[01:19:16.558 --> 01:19:21.361]  They all are the same talking points in the same order with someone else's name on it.
[01:19:21.821 --> 01:19:22.982]  I mean this is incredible.
[01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:24.781]  They don't have earpieces.
[01:19:25.161 --> 01:19:27.863]  So if they had an earpiece, perhaps they would be willing to do it.
[01:19:28.604 --> 01:19:32.366]  That's why audiences respond to Trump, because he's able to talk to them.
[01:19:32.406 --> 01:19:33.908]  Now listen, the guy's not perfect.
[01:19:34.628 --> 01:19:35.689]  We have to watch him.
[01:19:36.269 --> 01:19:37.870]  You always have to watch the watchers.
[01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:39.151]  You can't trust anything.
[01:19:39.412 --> 01:19:48.038]  This idea that we're waiting for a hero and that Superman is going to fly in on his cape and run the country and bring us to victory is what got us into this mess.
[01:19:48.078 --> 01:19:50.019]  No, you're absolutely right.
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:53.002]  But we know with Hillary, she's pure, certified evil.
[01:19:53.595 --> 01:19:53.855]  Yes.
[01:19:54.896 --> 01:19:57.579]  Somebody put it really great to me a few weeks ago.
[01:19:57.599 --> 01:20:09.870]  They said, alright, maybe somebody in your show, they said there's two doors, and behind one of the doors is a man-eating bear, and behind the other door might be a man-eating bear, might be a teddy bear, might be who knows?
[01:20:10.450 --> 01:20:12.671]  You know what's behind door number one.
[01:20:13.031 --> 01:20:15.852]  At least you got a chance with what's behind door number two.
[01:20:16.172 --> 01:20:25.235]  And then, by the way, it's up to you, it's up to me, it's up to every single American person to make sure that the Constitution is upheld and protected.
[01:20:25.516 --> 01:20:26.016]  It's our job.
[01:20:26.596 --> 01:20:29.697]  He's bringing all that back and exactly the globalists are already behind the scenes.
[01:20:29.737 --> 01:20:30.838]  They know it's in door number two.
[01:20:31.098 --> 01:20:32.178]  They know he's a populist.
[01:20:32.198 --> 01:20:33.159]  They know he's a patriot.
[01:20:33.419 --> 01:20:35.060]  They know he sees himself as an underdog.
[01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:37.081]  He really wants to empower this country.
[01:20:37.121 --> 01:20:38.181]  Now he might be manipulated.
[01:20:38.481 --> 01:20:39.342]  He is very pig-headed.
[01:20:39.382 --> 01:20:39.982]  It's why they hate him.
[01:20:40.202 --> 01:20:41.923]  He will take basically almost no one's advice.
[01:20:43.164 --> 01:20:44.985]  Strangely enough, unless you just really straight shoot him.
[01:20:45.466 --> 01:20:49.509]  The media can't stand the fact that Trump actually listens to me because nobody else seems to.
[01:20:49.549 --> 01:20:54.994]  But I mean, it's just crazy to be in this day and age and to know for a fact Trump is real.
[01:20:55.034 --> 01:20:55.515]  But you're right.
[01:20:55.855 --> 01:20:57.076]  He's a man like anybody else.
[01:20:57.356 --> 01:20:58.477]  We can't put everything in him.
[01:20:58.798 --> 01:21:02.041]  We've got to just use him as a figurehead to try to bring the Republic back.
[01:21:02.830 --> 01:21:06.492]  And just because you like something doesn't mean you have to be against something else.
[01:21:06.752 --> 01:21:09.193]  If you're going to be against something else, be against lying.
[01:21:09.493 --> 01:21:10.614]  Be against corruption.
[01:21:10.894 --> 01:21:13.335]  Be against dissolving the Constitution.
[01:21:13.355 --> 01:21:18.597]  Those are the things that I think that we can all agree on together that are not worthy endeavors.
[01:21:18.757 --> 01:21:20.578]  And then we can unite against those things.
[01:21:20.818 --> 01:21:26.121]  But just because you're going, you know, there's people here, there's so many closet Trump fans.
[01:21:26.801 --> 01:21:36.507]  It's going to be a very interesting election in a few days here because there are so many people that are just waiting in the weeds and not saying what they're doing.
[01:21:37.388 --> 01:21:41.971]  And you look around and you talk to the cab drivers and you talk to the working people of the country.
[01:21:42.371 --> 01:21:43.972]  That was my next question.
[01:21:43.992 --> 01:21:48.195]  Matt Dubiel, station manager there at the wckg.com, 1530 AM in Chicago.
[01:21:50.316 --> 01:21:57.823]  I was going to say this a few weeks ago because it was already there, but it got so over the top now that I can tell you, I have Democrats running up to me.
[01:21:57.883 --> 01:21:59.765]  Black, white, Hispanic, old, young, you name it.
[01:22:00.766 --> 01:22:04.630]  Waiters at restaurants, cab drivers stopping and seeing me, people at grocery stores.
[01:22:05.330 --> 01:22:08.073]  Of all walks of life going, they really are set up against Trump.
[01:22:08.373 --> 01:22:09.794]  Hillary really does work for the mob.
[01:22:10.035 --> 01:22:10.895]  She really does want war.
[01:22:11.616 --> 01:22:14.097]  And I ask him, I go, do your other Democrat friends feel the same?
[01:22:14.117 --> 01:22:15.038]  They go, absolutely.
[01:22:15.438 --> 01:22:17.379]  I don't know anybody that isn't voting for Trump.
[01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:25.484]  And then you're like, oh my gosh, no wonder they're having to add 9, 10, 20, 30, 40 points oversampling of Democrats to claim she's in the lead.
[01:22:25.704 --> 01:22:29.426]  And even with all that oversampling, he's now in the lead in most battleground states.
[01:22:29.466 --> 01:22:31.067]  So what is your, you're a smart guy.
[01:22:31.267 --> 01:22:32.808]  What does your gut tell you is coming?
[01:22:32.828 --> 01:22:35.129]  And, and what do you think they're going to pull?
[01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:36.230]  We got 10 days left here.
[01:22:37.475 --> 01:22:40.518]  I've been overcome with a sense of peace about this.
[01:22:40.538 --> 01:22:45.622]  I've been really bottled up and really pent up about this whole thing for a little while and really quiet.
[01:22:46.042 --> 01:22:49.905]  And just this week, I got overwhelmed with a sense of peace about it.
[01:22:49.925 --> 01:22:50.486]  Let me just stop you.
[01:22:50.506 --> 01:22:50.926]  I've got to interrupt.
[01:22:51.547 --> 01:22:52.828]  We did not talk before you came on, did we?
[01:22:53.628 --> 01:22:53.709]  No.
[01:22:54.977 --> 01:23:07.007]  I said this on the show earlier this week, I have been so bottled up, I couldn't sleep, so upset, like I wasn't doing enough, and it's the craziest thing, on Monday, driving to work, this peace hit me, and I have just been so much more at peace.
[01:23:07.087 --> 01:23:11.230]  It's crazy, it's like, I felt America come back from the dead on Monday.
[01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:13.132]  Are you saying you felt that?
[01:23:13.652 --> 01:23:16.295]  That's exactly what, that's exactly what I'm feeling.
[01:23:16.835 --> 01:23:18.577]  Exactly how I feel.
[01:23:19.198 --> 01:23:21.901]  And it's a very calming feeling.
[01:23:22.521 --> 01:23:30.149]  And that doesn't mean that I want to, it's a feeling of, you know, there's people by me that don't want to put yard signs up.
[01:23:30.309 --> 01:23:31.571]  I don't care if I have a yard sign or not.
[01:23:31.851 --> 01:23:32.952]  Before I would be like, no way.
[01:23:33.012 --> 01:23:34.452]  We're not putting a Trump sign in our yard.
[01:23:34.492 --> 01:23:35.053]  We're not doing this.
[01:23:35.073 --> 01:23:35.553]  We're not doing that.
[01:23:35.853 --> 01:23:38.854]  I have this feeling like, um, it's, it's okay.
[01:23:38.914 --> 01:23:40.435]  Things are going to be okay.
[01:23:40.775 --> 01:23:54.919]  And, and I believe that the people that you see at these rallies, these Trump rallies, these, these thousands of Americans, my parents, baby boomers, baby boomers, and their parents, my grandmother is 98 years old.
[01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:59.441]  She will tell you until you'll stop listening how Donald Trump is going to be the next president.
[01:23:59.884 --> 01:24:12.293]  Now, there is a little bit of danger in that because, again, we don't want to get into the same situation where, you know, the President is Superman with the cape standing above us all and impervious to judgment and being held accountable.
[01:24:12.353 --> 01:24:14.374]  We have to hold our leaders accountable.
[01:24:14.875 --> 01:24:19.778]  However, I do feel that there is, that everything is going to work out.
[01:24:19.878 --> 01:24:22.180]  I do believe that America is on the upswing.
[01:24:23.081 --> 01:24:24.902]  Even when you hear a guy like Michael Moore,
[01:24:25.262 --> 01:24:27.003]  Well, I don't ever want to hear.
[01:24:27.023 --> 01:24:28.504]  I don't ever want to see.
[01:24:28.944 --> 01:24:37.008]  But I watched that clip and I thought, yeah, Michael Moore is telling the story about Trump taking on Ford.
[01:24:37.028 --> 01:24:40.110]  And for those that haven't heard it, let's try to queue that up for the next segment.
[01:24:42.294 --> 01:24:43.435]  And I analyzed what he did.
[01:24:43.495 --> 01:24:50.280]  He gives like a five-minute speech, and he admits that we've been screwed over by globalists, both parties have done it, now both parties are against Trump.
[01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:54.703]  People see it, they want to send a big FU signal, that's his quote, to them.
[01:24:55.223 --> 01:25:00.086]  That's how he baits you in the beginning of the film and the trailers and promos, because he knows Trump's like 70% now.
[01:25:00.807 --> 01:25:01.727]  He just wants to make money.
[01:25:01.967 --> 01:25:06.931]  Then he baits you in the second half of the movie, endorses Hillary and gives some pseudo-intellectual garbage.
[01:25:07.191 --> 01:25:11.574]  But the fact that he still has to act like he's with the populist and with Flint,
[01:25:12.596 --> 01:25:17.187]  Because that's his whole identity, shows this crisis of conscience they're having.
[01:25:18.248 --> 01:25:26.450]  It's one of those things where I just, I think that a lot of people have had it and they laid silent.
[01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:28.391]  They didn't vote the last election.
[01:25:28.651 --> 01:25:31.611]  They didn't think their vote mattered in the last election.
[01:25:31.971 --> 01:25:40.413]  It's not cool, it's not hip to be, I tell you what, you bring up Trump at one of my kids' schools and in certain areas, boy, you're like a leper.
[01:25:40.914 --> 01:25:42.394]  You can't even talk about the guy.
[01:25:42.774 --> 01:25:45.316]  And for that reason, a lot of people will not discuss it.
[01:25:45.696 --> 01:25:59.144]  But what happens when people go out and actually punch their ticket and vote, which everybody gets to do here, and some people more often than they should, unfortunately, that's where I think the tide is going to turn.
[01:25:59.385 --> 01:26:02.787]  And either way, I think that it's going to be a landslide victory.
[01:26:02.847 --> 01:26:06.149]  I think that it's going to be really empowering and inspiring.
[01:26:06.529 --> 01:26:07.430]  But even if it isn't,
[01:26:08.776 --> 01:26:14.460]  I have this feeling of peace about it because that's what's going to lead to the next step.
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:15.060]  There you go.
[01:26:15.201 --> 01:26:20.004]  Even if they steal it, which I believe Trump's going to win, if they're going to have to steal it, it's the animating contest of liberty.
[01:26:20.024 --> 01:26:22.605]  It's like we're learning to lift weights again or jog.
[01:26:22.926 --> 01:26:28.509]  We're getting stronger as we move forward and Trump is exposing the globalists, the inside deals.
[01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:30.691]  This is irrevocable damage he's causing.
[01:26:30.991 --> 01:26:32.352]  That's why there's no corporate money.
[01:26:32.392 --> 01:26:37.035]  That's why all the internal Republican emails say we've got to stop him and let's get Paul Ryan's, you know,
[01:26:37.475 --> 01:26:40.457]  A family member, a Supreme Court Justice, you know, Hillary wants him to have that.
[01:26:40.817 --> 01:26:49.643]  It's revealing the whole sordid mess, and the more they try to twist things to stay in power, the more they burn themselves down in self-immolation.
[01:26:49.703 --> 01:26:51.865]  So, I don't put a good face on things.
[01:26:51.885 --> 01:26:53.046]  I'm always accused of being the fearmonger.
[01:26:53.326 --> 01:27:00.251]  I wasn't fearmongering, I was saying what was really going on to get the giant awake, to get him out of bed, and now it's happening.
[01:27:00.811 --> 01:27:04.832]  Because what the fear-mongering is, is the crap that they're pulling off at these rallies.
[01:27:04.872 --> 01:27:10.614]  What the fear-mongering is, is then the storytelling about who is doing the deed at the Chicago rally.
[01:27:10.694 --> 01:27:12.415]  Oh, these Trump people are terrible!
[01:27:12.615 --> 01:27:13.355]  Oh, they're idiots!
[01:27:13.495 --> 01:27:14.196]  Oh, they're inbred!
[01:27:14.236 --> 01:27:14.676]  They're this!
[01:27:14.696 --> 01:27:15.356]  They're rednecks!
[01:27:15.376 --> 01:27:15.776]  They're that!
[01:27:16.216 --> 01:27:17.337]  No, they're not.
[01:27:17.937 --> 01:27:19.477]  They're really great American people.
[01:27:19.857 --> 01:27:20.858]  I saw veterans.
[01:27:20.998 --> 01:27:22.138]  I saw people with their kids.
[01:27:22.198 --> 01:27:26.860]  And let me tell you, Alex, I almost brought my kids to that rally in Chicago.
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:28.040]  My wife and I went.
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:29.821]  And when I found out,
[01:27:30.888 --> 01:27:34.932]  Well, let me expand on this.
[01:27:35.052 --> 01:27:51.249]  I physically, as a father, if I tried to go to a mainline political rally and there were thugs hired by Hillary to try to beat me and my kids up, I'm not looking for trouble, I'm not one of these guys that shoots his mouth off, but I mean, you start flipping some switches here that don't get flipped back, these people are the enemy, and that's why we knew.
[01:27:51.269 --> 01:27:52.791]  You notice the police cancelled the rally
[01:27:53.291 --> 01:27:54.352]  And that's the intel we got.
[01:27:54.372 --> 01:27:57.575]  They knew they were sending over a thousand people to cause a riot.
[01:27:57.835 --> 01:28:00.477]  The police had to cancel it because they knew they were planning to have a stampede.
[01:28:00.497 --> 01:28:01.318]  You name it.
[01:28:01.458 --> 01:28:02.799]  This is the criminal activity.
[01:28:03.179 --> 01:28:08.083]  And then they attack the police and Democrats are on TV saying, oh, we love them bleeding and all this crap.
[01:28:08.384 --> 01:28:12.147]  They're trying to cause a civil war when they're the corrupt establishment.
[01:28:12.727 --> 01:28:14.369]  I mean, it is so ridiculous.
[01:28:14.949 --> 01:28:16.350]  Thank God for those Chicago cops.
[01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:22.974]  You know, the cops are getting a bad rap because of certain areas in Chicago and a murder rate in a gangland area.
[01:28:23.394 --> 01:28:26.176]  Those cops saved countless people that night.
[01:28:26.236 --> 01:28:31.639]  When we left, when my wife and I left, we bugged the heck out of there so fast it made your head spin.
[01:28:31.859 --> 01:28:34.021]  But when we left, they were smashing cars.
[01:28:34.061 --> 01:28:40.545]  These thugs, these kids that they paid to go in there to tear the joint up, were smashing people's cars with bricks.
[01:28:40.965 --> 01:28:43.347]  They were, uh, they, one cop was bloodied up.
[01:28:43.707 --> 01:28:44.948]  It was a melee.
[01:28:45.248 --> 01:28:47.249]  And they took that area over.
[01:28:47.570 --> 01:28:51.192]  And then they blamed it on somebody else, the Bernie supporters.
[01:28:52.033 --> 01:29:00.018]  And all the while, and I forget the organization that was, uh, that had the Craigslist ads that I found after the event, where they showed that they were hiring.
[01:29:00.178 --> 01:29:07.063]  You know, they had job ads that were out saying, hey, we're gonna pay you 15 bucks to infiltrate this event and do damage.
[01:29:07.583 --> 01:29:14.628]  And then they treated one of the community organizers that was at the event, instigating, as though he was some local hero.
[01:29:15.769 --> 01:29:19.972]  And made it a Black Lives Matter thing, and twisted it and turned it.
[01:29:20.372 --> 01:29:24.054]  And then to come to find out that it's all orchestrated...
[01:29:25.015 --> 01:29:27.356]  It's like, what you thought was true was true.
[01:29:27.416 --> 01:29:28.817]  What you thought was true was true.
[01:29:28.877 --> 01:29:30.838]  What I thought was true turned out to be the truth.
[01:29:30.858 --> 01:29:33.099]  We now have the WikiLeaks, the documents, and let's explain.
[01:29:33.399 --> 01:29:37.721]  You demonize black people in general by going out and racially hiring black people to go attack.
[01:29:38.062 --> 01:29:38.602]  That's what they did.
[01:29:39.242 --> 01:29:42.464]  You demonize Sanders people by blaming it on them, and then you also blame it on Trump.
[01:29:42.684 --> 01:29:43.264]  Who's left out?
[01:29:43.484 --> 01:29:44.925]  Hillary and the Chicago mob.
[01:29:45.345 --> 01:29:47.246]  That's where she comes from, it's what her dad did.
[01:29:47.266 --> 01:29:50.448]  I mean, this is how you manage all the little people, the dumbasses.
[01:29:50.908 --> 01:29:52.449]  That's what she calls the new WikiLeaks.
[01:29:52.829 --> 01:29:53.790]  Her dumb supporters.
[01:29:54.150 --> 01:29:55.671]  We'll be right back with Matt Dubiel.
[01:29:55.691 --> 01:29:56.152]  Stay with us.
[01:29:56.392 --> 01:29:57.953]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:30:00.234 --> 01:30:01.135]  We're on the march.
[01:30:01.635 --> 01:30:03.236]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:04.157 --> 01:30:06.839]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.695 --> 01:30:21.065]  If you ever wanted to live off the grid and produce your own clean energy in a silent, reliable way, this is a message you want to pay very close attention to.
[01:30:21.565 --> 01:30:32.155]  Thanks to a new development in solar generator technology, it's now possible for my listeners and viewers to produce their own source of emergency backup electricity.
[01:30:32.595 --> 01:30:35.576]  And even more importantly, it's now extremely affordable.
[01:30:35.996 --> 01:30:41.917]  Thanks to the guys at Solutions for Science, you can get one of these $6,000 solar generators for less than $1,500.
[01:30:44.378 --> 01:30:46.718]  We have these units at the office and at my home.
[01:30:47.058 --> 01:30:52.460]  I can run my sump pumps, my shortwave radios, all of my devices, and even keep our food from spoiling.
[01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:57.641]  Go to powergridchaos.com and get 70% off for a limited time.
[01:30:58.041 --> 01:31:01.784]  Folks, there has never been a better time to get off the grid.
[01:31:02.125 --> 01:31:06.448]  It's going to be crucial in 2017, maybe even life-saving.
[01:31:06.749 --> 01:31:08.851]  Powergridchaos.com for 70% off.
[01:31:10.615 --> 01:31:18.023]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:31:18.504 --> 01:31:26.172]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[01:31:26.432 --> 01:31:28.534]  As president, I will make it clear.
[01:31:29.395 --> 01:31:34.140]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[01:31:34.701 --> 01:31:40.087]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[01:31:40.127 --> 01:31:43.310]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[01:31:43.511 --> 01:31:46.474]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[01:31:46.554 --> 01:31:49.117]  We came, we saw, he died.
[01:31:51.508 --> 01:31:53.511]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[01:31:53.872 --> 01:31:57.317]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[01:31:57.558 --> 01:32:05.450]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[01:32:07.352 --> 01:32:07.832]  The U.S.
[01:32:07.872 --> 01:32:11.495]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[01:32:11.855 --> 01:32:19.460]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[01:32:19.841 --> 01:32:22.182]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[01:32:22.562 --> 01:32:25.444]  Of course not, because she's... There's a really loud noise.
[01:32:26.845 --> 01:32:30.928]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[01:32:30.948 --> 01:32:33.150]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[01:32:36.997 --> 01:32:41.414]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:33:27.669 --> 01:33:31.572]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:33.173 --> 01:33:37.916]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:40.418 --> 01:33:46.822]  So we're in that weird flux space, where the globalists saw a major upheaval coming decades ago.
[01:33:46.902 --> 01:33:53.287]  It's in the major Defense Department reports, Ministry of Defense reports out of the UK as well, in 2007's when they declassified a lot of it.
[01:33:54.639 --> 01:33:57.862]  And they know there's a revolution coming against the worldwide corporate tyranny.
[01:33:59.023 --> 01:34:00.365]  That's even in the Washington Post now.
[01:34:00.505 --> 01:34:01.546]  World government's in trouble.
[01:34:01.606 --> 01:34:02.587]  We did rip people off.
[01:34:02.687 --> 01:34:03.308]  What do we do?
[01:34:04.489 --> 01:34:07.091]  More global taxes and this time really redistribute.
[01:34:08.533 --> 01:34:10.335]  But that's always the cover for more power.
[01:34:11.196 --> 01:34:13.558]  And more centralization and more cronyism.
[01:34:14.499 --> 01:34:18.403]  And along comes Donald Trump riding a wave of nationalism globally.
[01:34:19.471 --> 01:34:23.693]  Make no mistake, he's a big wave coming in, but he's only one wave, just like InfoWars is one wave.
[01:34:24.194 --> 01:34:25.434]  Or Matt Drudge is another wave.
[01:34:25.715 --> 01:34:27.416]  All of you are just as important as we are.
[01:34:27.976 --> 01:34:29.797]  Matt Dubiel, the eyes and ears of the people.
[01:34:29.817 --> 01:34:33.899]  You know, they're managing the station, doing his own show on 1530 in Chicago.
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:35.460]  WCKG.com.
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:36.441]  We're going back to him in just a moment.
[01:34:37.722 --> 01:34:41.383]  But I want to open the phones up as well while he's here with us in this hour.
[01:34:41.403 --> 01:34:45.805]  Then Roger Stone's popping in about what do you make of all the vote flipping coming in and dead people voting.
[01:34:45.845 --> 01:35:01.930]  I mean CBS, ABC, to their credit local news is all confirming it with election officials in Illinois and in Maryland and in Texas and in Colorado and in Virginia and in Florida and I mean you name it.
[01:35:03.010 --> 01:35:05.371]  There are so many reports pouring in at vote
[01:35:06.863 --> 01:35:08.486]  at InfoWars.com, that's the email.
[01:35:08.727 --> 01:35:12.254]  Vote at InfoWars.com and if you see fraud or evidence...
[01:35:13.368 --> 01:35:14.088]  Send it to us there.
[01:35:14.448 --> 01:35:16.189]  That's where we're getting all these tips from around the country.
[01:35:16.869 --> 01:35:29.114]  And it makes my head spin to then see mainstream media go, the Russians are hacking everything, the Russians are taking over, it's the worst election ever, the UN's coming in with the EU to oversee our elections, emergency, emergency, Trump's trying to steal it.
[01:35:29.374 --> 01:35:30.775]  Meanwhile, there's also this thing as election fraud.
[01:35:30.815 --> 01:35:32.016]  It's totally insane if you believe it exists.
[01:35:32.396 --> 01:35:33.496]  On and on and on.
[01:35:33.876 --> 01:35:38.518]  And then I've got Bloomberg, as I mentioned, going, yes, cities are passing laws for illegals to vote.
[01:35:38.878 --> 01:35:39.799]  And yes, they're voting.
[01:35:39.819 --> 01:35:40.779]  But what's the big deal?
[01:35:40.819 --> 01:35:41.759]  Trump's a fearmonger.
[01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:42.760]  It doesn't exist.
[01:35:44.121 --> 01:35:49.586]  They're doing some weird psychological warfare stuff where they discredit themselves in front of you.
[01:35:51.347 --> 01:35:55.271]  It's really sophisticated stuff, but I don't see it working.
[01:35:56.952 --> 01:35:57.853]  Or maybe it's not sophisticated.
[01:35:57.873 --> 01:36:00.916]  Maybe it's just the mental illness of con men once they get caught.
[01:36:01.657 --> 01:36:03.078]  So just keep trying to run the same scam.
[01:36:03.098 --> 01:36:04.839]  We're going back to Matt here in just a moment.
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:06.381]  Before we go any further,
[01:36:09.548 --> 01:36:12.969]  I sell things that I use, that I believe in, that are high quality.
[01:36:13.009 --> 01:36:21.371]  I mean, if I go to Cabela's and find some cook stove I think's great, I say, hey, call this company, buy 2,000 of them, try to get a better price than anybody's got and sell them.
[01:36:21.391 --> 01:36:22.892]  Yeah, I mean, that's what I do.
[01:36:23.832 --> 01:36:25.192]  There's particular optics I really like.
[01:36:25.232 --> 01:36:26.973]  I say, hey, let's pick those up and sell those in the store.
[01:36:27.813 --> 01:36:32.634]  The best water filtration systems, the best non-GMO heirloom seeds, the best nutraceuticals.
[01:36:33.274 --> 01:36:35.135]  About a third of what we sell at InfoWarsLife.com
[01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:36.620]  Yes.
[01:36:59.445 --> 01:37:02.047]  25% off on Brain Force, the amazing nootropic.
[01:37:02.287 --> 01:37:03.207]  That ends this weekend.
[01:37:04.248 --> 01:37:05.228]  Just go check it out for yourself.
[01:37:05.248 --> 01:37:09.610]  30 to 40% off on super high quality storable foods produced right here in America in Utah.
[01:37:10.231 --> 01:37:14.113]  We can only do this discount every once in a while, but people are taking advantage of this.
[01:37:14.933 --> 01:37:15.614]  30 to 40 percent off.
[01:37:15.634 --> 01:37:17.134]  Have you ever thought about getting storable food?
[01:37:17.695 --> 01:37:21.777]  With all the war talk and the economy and the rest of it, this is insurance you can eat for 25 years.
[01:37:22.157 --> 01:37:24.318]  This is insurance you'll be able to always use.
[01:37:24.559 --> 01:37:28.721]  And with inflation, you'll be able to save money in the future eating your investments.
[01:37:28.761 --> 01:37:32.763]  So you cannot lose with this, because on top of it, you're supporting the InfoWar, a 360 win.
[01:37:37.901 --> 01:37:41.185]  So make no mistake, we're doing amazing things together.
[01:37:41.365 --> 01:37:42.406]  Thank you for your support.
[01:37:42.486 --> 01:37:43.487]  We are the tip of the spear.
[01:37:43.568 --> 01:37:44.729]  You are at the heart of that.
[01:37:45.490 --> 01:37:47.792]  Look at how everything Hillary does turns to pure crap.
[01:37:48.313 --> 01:37:51.376]  Look at how all their evil is being brought out into light.
[01:37:52.338 --> 01:37:55.361]  Look at how good it's beginning to stand up, and it's only beginning.
[01:37:55.901 --> 01:38:06.690]  So your financial support of this broadcast and our local stations being a sponsor, supporting the local stations, spreading the word, that's just as important as supporting this operation and what we do.
[01:38:06.730 --> 01:38:08.932]  But, you know, the network's got its spots, that's great.
[01:38:09.052 --> 01:38:10.273]  That doesn't fund our operation.
[01:38:11.234 --> 01:38:15.178]  I fund our operation 70-80% through direct sales.
[01:38:15.558 --> 01:38:16.819]  We have some great sponsors as well.
[01:38:17.159 --> 01:38:19.862]  But understand, you cannot
[01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:25.684]  Spend money someplace to get better products at better prices to support a better cause.
[01:38:25.964 --> 01:38:29.287]  It is a win-win-win-win-win-win-win.
[01:38:29.948 --> 01:38:38.095]  And even if you don't want to check into high-quality colloidal silver at the lowest price, you're going to find it at the highest quality.
[01:38:38.735 --> 01:38:39.016]  Fine.
[01:38:39.276 --> 01:38:41.398]  Just spread the links, the videos, the articles.
[01:38:41.498 --> 01:38:42.359]  That's what really matters.
[01:38:42.379 --> 01:38:44.681]  Your time, your energy is what's really valuable.
[01:38:45.481 --> 01:38:46.722]  And we've got this new video out.
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:47.940]  I don't know.
[01:39:09.525 --> 01:39:12.107]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:39:12.167 --> 01:39:18.693]  Now listen, a lot of folks will say, you put this up at 5 o'clock yesterday, as of showtime it had a million views.
[01:39:18.713 --> 01:39:22.376]  700,000 on Facebook, another 300,000 or so on our two YouTubes.
[01:39:22.436 --> 01:39:23.417]  That isn't enough, okay?
[01:39:24.438 --> 01:39:26.540]  I want 20 million views by the end of the weekend.
[01:39:28.358 --> 01:39:29.999]  Because I know this will devastate them.
[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:34.382]  I know this is the most powerful political ad of this cycle.
[01:39:35.163 --> 01:39:38.005]  This is what they did against Barry Goldwater, but it was the opposite.
[01:39:38.765 --> 01:39:40.086]  The warmonger was LBJ.
[01:39:40.406 --> 01:39:42.848]  We're actually turning it around at them right now.
[01:39:44.049 --> 01:39:44.669]  This is the ad.
[01:39:45.050 --> 01:39:45.510]  This is it.
[01:39:45.530 --> 01:39:47.171]  This is the 2016 version of the 1964 version.
[01:39:47.191 --> 01:39:48.252]  So this is it.
[01:39:57.293 --> 01:40:02.015]  You want to start your attack run, folks, on the Death Star, this is what you load onto your X-Wing.
[01:40:03.155 --> 01:40:05.776]  You need to get this out to everybody, and I mean aggressively.
[01:40:05.856 --> 01:40:07.476]  I'm begging our stations to air it.
[01:40:07.776 --> 01:40:08.917]  I'm begging everyone.
[01:40:08.957 --> 01:40:10.377]  I'm begging, I'm begging, I'm begging.
[01:40:10.737 --> 01:40:11.197]  Please!
[01:40:11.557 --> 01:40:14.698]  I did another video yesterday that we have time on the play.
[01:40:14.718 --> 01:40:16.199]  I was going to air it now, but I wanted to be with our guests.
[01:40:17.662 --> 01:40:28.454]  Where they have rappers that sing to the Obama kids, and Hillary goes, literally saying, I drug women and rape them, and they don't know I had sex with them, and I bitch slap them.
[01:40:28.634 --> 01:40:29.275]  These are lyrics.
[01:40:31.056 --> 01:40:33.519]  And then this arrogant witch
[01:40:34.537 --> 01:40:54.270]  Hillary and her cohort, Michelle, get up there on TV and shake, I'm so scared when I heard the Trump video and he makes kids listen to it, you're the ones that secretly recorded it and edited it out of context and then ran with it while you're funding radical Muslims to cut women's genitals off everywhere.
[01:40:54.470 --> 01:41:02.856]  Hillary stays in the same hotel room with a crepazoid Abidine, Uma, whose mother is the top pusher of genital mutilation of women.
[01:41:03.096 --> 01:41:03.997]  What the hell?
[01:41:04.957 --> 01:41:07.899]  You people have... I just... Matt, that's the thing.
[01:41:08.340 --> 01:41:11.602]  Like you said, I kind of sat out the last election because I just hold my nose.
[01:41:11.622 --> 01:41:12.663]  The Republican Party is horrible.
[01:41:13.003 --> 01:41:13.744]  Now they're against Trump.
[01:41:13.764 --> 01:41:14.464]  Another certification.
[01:41:16.246 --> 01:41:21.089]  McCain, Obama... I was so sick of Bush, I wasn't for Obama, but I just kind of hung back.
[01:41:21.509 --> 01:41:27.334]  Now it's so clear, but the hypocrisy... Does the mainstream media know that they're basically killing themselves?
[01:41:29.116 --> 01:41:29.877]  I think they must.
[01:41:30.297 --> 01:41:30.838]  I think they must.
[01:41:30.858 --> 01:41:31.739]  They look at their numbers.
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:33.401]  Their ratings are down.
[01:41:33.441 --> 01:41:34.942]  Their web traffic is down.
[01:41:35.022 --> 01:41:37.605]  Their web properties are a fugazi.
[01:41:37.846 --> 01:41:43.713]  The number one and number two broadcasting companies are on the verge of bankruptcy.
[01:41:43.753 --> 01:41:45.074]  They're on the verge of being delisted.
[01:41:45.435 --> 01:41:47.277]  One of them had to do a reverse
[01:41:47.517 --> 01:41:47.977]  I don't know.
[01:42:09.778 --> 01:42:14.079]  You know, you talked about getting hit in the stomach at events, and them sending people into the event.
[01:42:14.319 --> 01:42:16.159]  That is classic bullying.
[01:42:16.439 --> 01:42:23.461]  The bully pretends like they didn't do anything when the teacher comes around, or when the authority figure comes around, and then they blame somebody else.
[01:42:24.161 --> 01:42:29.922]  And then, all the while, the person that was trying to break up the bullying is the one blamed for being the bully.
[01:42:30.362 --> 01:42:36.704]  These people here, and what people have to realize here is, this is not a thing about being a Democrat or a Republican.
[01:42:37.324 --> 01:42:40.407]  This, this is, Hillary's a bad, a bad person!
[01:42:40.567 --> 01:42:41.808]  She's a, she's a criminal!
[01:42:42.428 --> 01:42:43.770]  It is criminal activity!
[01:42:44.230 --> 01:42:56.841]  If it were not for InfoWars, if it were not for O'Keefe, who, and that's another issue, by the way, is, is when I've, you know, you ask people to share your, your video, which is great, uh, and, and, and it's really, you know, hits you hard.
[01:42:57.321 --> 01:42:59.764]  But you share that stuff, and then people come at you.
[01:43:00.324 --> 01:43:05.249]  And some of the comments I'm getting about O'Keefe are, oh, he's this, or oh, and I'm not going to repeat it.
[01:43:05.329 --> 01:43:06.931]  Because when you say it, you give it power.
[01:43:06.951 --> 01:43:07.511]  I'm not going to do that.
[01:43:07.531 --> 01:43:07.892]  Well, sure.
[01:43:07.952 --> 01:43:12.256]  What you've got is a bunch of followers who pick up on the talking point, and they want to handpick everybody.
[01:43:12.276 --> 01:43:12.636]  Here's the deal.
[01:43:12.736 --> 01:43:13.597]  O'Keefe, myself, you.
[01:43:14.378 --> 01:43:15.620]  We just want to change things.
[01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:18.905]  We don't care if we get attacked, because we know we're doing the right thing.
[01:43:18.945 --> 01:43:19.666]  That's called leadership.
[01:43:19.686 --> 01:43:22.870]  By the way, since you mentioned Hillary's a criminal, this just broke Huffington Post.
[01:43:22.910 --> 01:43:24.372]  It's going up on Infowars.com.
[01:43:24.673 --> 01:43:26.535]  I haven't looked yet, but Drudge always is ahead of us.
[01:43:26.555 --> 01:43:27.917]  I'm sure it's on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:34.083]  It's reopening investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email, and I said this two days ago.
[01:43:34.583 --> 01:43:35.563]  It's over, okay?
[01:43:35.784 --> 01:43:40.546]  I mean, there's no way the FBI can ignore this, or they discredit themselves, times ten, what we've already seen.
[01:43:41.547 --> 01:43:50.492]  There's Fox News, FBI reopens investigation into Clinton email, because we have them saying we gotta scrub it, we gotta cover it up, we have the POTUS involved, we've got him lying.
[01:43:51.193 --> 01:43:52.754]  This is hardcore.
[01:43:53.214 --> 01:43:55.175]  And we've got them trying to bribe the FBI.
[01:43:55.535 --> 01:43:56.496]  Those memos have come out.
[01:43:56.576 --> 01:44:04.261]  The FBI released them, not WikiLeaks, to give them cushy jobs at embassies if they would cover up the classification garbage.
[01:44:04.561 --> 01:44:05.642]  This is the beginning of the end.
[01:44:05.682 --> 01:44:06.502]  Don't they get it?
[01:44:06.622 --> 01:44:14.427]  Criminals and thugs and scum, just like Hitler or anybody else, always think they're kicking everybody's ass until they make the good people get up and stand up.
[01:44:14.707 --> 01:44:20.210]  And if they think we're savaging them now and tearing their guts out now, we haven't even begun to move.
[01:44:20.230 --> 01:44:20.931]  It's like we've started
[01:44:21.411 --> 01:44:22.072]  We're racing.
[01:44:22.332 --> 01:44:24.013]  We're just now going off the blocks.
[01:44:24.353 --> 01:44:25.254]  We're accelerating.
[01:44:25.274 --> 01:44:26.115]  They're slowing down.
[01:44:26.375 --> 01:44:27.215]  We're not backing off.
[01:44:27.235 --> 01:44:28.316]  We're going to run them over.
[01:44:28.737 --> 01:44:29.657]  And they have to understand.
[01:44:30.058 --> 01:44:31.038]  It's a spiritual issue.
[01:44:31.238 --> 01:44:32.479]  We're running you over.
[01:44:32.639 --> 01:44:34.000]  I don't care what happens to me.
[01:44:34.461 --> 01:44:35.782]  I don't care if you ridicule me.
[01:44:36.182 --> 01:44:37.983]  I'm not a coward follower like you.
[01:44:38.264 --> 01:44:39.365]  Didn't you ever figure it out?
[01:44:39.645 --> 01:44:41.146]  I'm going to run over you.
[01:44:41.406 --> 01:44:42.807]  We're going to bang heads.
[01:44:43.087 --> 01:44:44.008]  You think you're tough?
[01:44:44.228 --> 01:44:45.289]  We'll see if you are.
[01:44:45.589 --> 01:44:47.691]  I'm ramming my head right through yours.
[01:44:47.971 --> 01:44:48.571]  I'm coming.
[01:44:49.452 --> 01:44:52.135]  I understand that spirit's rising and you're going to fail.
[01:44:52.175 --> 01:44:56.119]  You don't understand that spirit because you're a bunch of backstabbing, cowardly followers.
[01:44:56.439 --> 01:44:58.642]  You don't know what it is to stand up for what's right.
[01:44:58.662 --> 01:44:59.302]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[01:44:59.883 --> 01:45:00.403]  I agree.
[01:45:00.864 --> 01:45:10.073]  And what I want to encourage people, regular people, to stop doing is this nitpicking where somebody shares something with you.
[01:45:10.394 --> 01:45:11.435]  Yes, fact find.
[01:45:11.515 --> 01:45:12.656]  Yes, look up the facts.
[01:45:12.796 --> 01:45:14.417]  Yes, yes, do all that stuff!
[01:45:14.958 --> 01:45:19.021]  But this, this taking sides with the side that you took sides with before.
[01:45:19.402 --> 01:45:31.312]  You know, this idea that because you were, my grandfather is a first generation born American, and he was a Democrat for a hundred, if he were around today, he would not be voting for Hillary Clinton.
[01:45:31.712 --> 01:45:38.198]  And, and he would say, he would have the good sense to say, she's not the right person.
[01:45:38.718 --> 01:45:42.260]  Not, I'm going to align with her because I've always aligned with Democrats.
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:47.642]  Not, I'm gonna slam O'Keefe because I heard something about some other video that he did.
[01:45:47.662 --> 01:45:52.265]  I want people to stop it, because what happens is, you should be thanking O'Keefe.
[01:45:52.745 --> 01:46:03.430]  You should be thanking O'Keefe for doing those videos, and Project Veritas for doing those videos, Alex for sharing them and spreading them, so that you know about this massive, grand-scale corruption.
[01:46:03.690 --> 01:46:04.991]  You should be thanking WikiLeaks.
[01:46:05.111 --> 01:46:08.132]  I saw Sarah Silverman on, somebody retweeted, it might have been Anthony Cumia.
[01:46:08.492 --> 01:46:11.393]  He retweeted something about Sarah Silverman, the comedian.
[01:46:11.593 --> 01:46:14.554]  Raunchy, despicable comedian.
[01:46:15.454 --> 01:46:17.095]  Not even funny.
[01:46:17.215 --> 01:46:19.175]  Like a lot of people like her, right?
[01:46:19.255 --> 01:46:21.756]  A fake feminist operative that's actually enslaved women.
[01:46:22.336 --> 01:46:28.301]  Just like the other one that's always complaining about, oh, don't call me fat, and then she takes pictures of herself and says, look at me, look at me, look at me.
[01:46:28.321 --> 01:46:34.826]  Well, what about the young turds lady when she sits there and calls me fat, but then says, anyone that calls anybody fat should be arrested?
[01:46:35.287 --> 01:46:37.609]  Yeah, well, it's okay to call you fat because you're a man.
[01:46:37.869 --> 01:46:40.191]  We can make fun of white American men all day long.
[01:46:40.271 --> 01:46:42.112]  That's a whole topic for another time.
[01:46:42.392 --> 01:46:47.617]  But Anthony shares this tweet from Sarah Silverman saying, why is WikiLeaks verified on Twitter?
[01:46:48.217 --> 01:46:49.177]  Why is it verified?
[01:46:49.197 --> 01:46:50.458]  Well, how about this?
[01:46:50.938 --> 01:46:54.359]  Being verified on Twitter, number one, is not some stamp of approval.
[01:46:54.659 --> 01:46:57.680]  Number two, it's to make sure that you know where the information is coming from.
[01:46:57.780 --> 01:47:03.742]  It just means that this, the certified, I had to send them my driver's license and everything, that means it's actually you, so your identity isn't stolen.
[01:47:04.722 --> 01:47:11.488]  Absolutely, and we should be thanking WikiLeaks, we should be thanking O'Keefe and Veritas, and we should be checking the checkers.
[01:47:11.869 --> 01:47:20.657]  Well, sure, what they do is they change the subject and go, one time they said the phones were broken, so he went in a federal building to show that Mary Landrieu was lying, and that her phones weren't broken.
[01:47:20.997 --> 01:47:22.599]  Oh my God, they got him for trespassing!
[01:47:22.659 --> 01:47:24.340]  Oh my gosh, he's a hero!
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:27.083]  I mean, how many times have I trespassed to get a story?
[01:47:27.303 --> 01:47:27.903]  It's what you do!
[01:47:28.624 --> 01:47:36.506]  You follow everybody for a day and you're gonna see, what's that book, like three felonies they commit a day and they're, you know, they're negligible things.
[01:47:36.666 --> 01:47:39.727]  You gotta watch, people make mistakes, human beings make mistakes.
[01:47:39.807 --> 01:47:40.287]  That happens.
[01:47:40.347 --> 01:47:48.069]  Well here's the deal, they've been breaking the law on every front, overrunning those of us that have consciences and that really care about what we do for our families, and the gloves are coming off.
[01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:53.351]  So, you know, at this point, again, I think the piece that you're talking about that's come over a lot of people is,
[01:47:53.911 --> 01:47:57.073]  You can really feel the gloves coming off, and like you said, we're in the right journey.
[01:47:57.373 --> 01:48:05.438]  Whatever happens, we're gaining momentum, we're gaining strength, the worm is turning, and the globalists know it.
[01:48:05.798 --> 01:48:06.678]  I was wearing this shirt.
[01:48:06.698 --> 01:48:08.639]  It's one of my favorite shirts, my InfoWars shirt.
[01:48:08.699 --> 01:48:09.520]  It's kind of the G.I.
[01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:10.861]  Joe InfoWars shirt.
[01:48:10.881 --> 01:48:11.721]  I'm sure you still have them.
[01:48:11.741 --> 01:48:13.062]  Because there's a war on for your mind, yes.
[01:48:14.079 --> 01:48:17.382]  Yeah, I'm wearing it in, uh, we did a broadcast last week in Jamaica.
[01:48:18.103 --> 01:48:21.666]  And, uh, people in Jamaica, Alex, were stopping me.
[01:48:22.066 --> 01:48:25.029]  Local Jamaicans, people at the resort, people in the taxi.
[01:48:25.049 --> 01:48:26.791]  Uh, I recorded two of them.
[01:48:27.391 --> 01:48:30.935]  And people in Jamaica, and I said, well, you know, why are you watching InfoWars?
[01:48:30.955 --> 01:48:32.356]  Like, what, what's it to you?
[01:48:32.656 --> 01:48:34.578]  Jamaica is its own, you know, nation.
[01:48:34.598 --> 01:48:39.623]  It was, uh, under the... Well, they were prosperous until the globalists took them over, so they know, they know about globalism.
[01:48:40.216 --> 01:48:40.756]  They're into it.
[01:48:40.936 --> 01:48:42.297]  They're watching every move.
[01:48:42.377 --> 01:48:46.618]  Oh, listen, I'm not bragging because I'm nobody, but I mean, I've been in London a few times the last few years.
[01:48:46.978 --> 01:48:49.079]  I'll stop at Big Bend or just out on the bridge.
[01:48:49.519 --> 01:48:50.799]  And I mean, we've done live streams.
[01:48:50.819 --> 01:48:54.721]  It's been on tape where 60, 70% of people walking by from all the world are listeners.
[01:48:55.615 --> 01:48:59.499]  People from China, people from Germany, people from Russia, people from the UK.
[01:48:59.579 --> 01:49:00.620]  I mean, that's what I mean.
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:02.461]  The mainstream media is... Let me ask you this question.
[01:49:02.481 --> 01:49:06.986]  They're finally getting that the original, you know, internet was talk radio because it's open free form.
[01:49:07.306 --> 01:49:11.750]  So that's kind of merged and created the format of the new internet TV show that's dominating everything.
[01:49:12.070 --> 01:49:14.293]  They've now figured out that one of my reporters...
[01:49:14.813 --> 01:49:20.276]  Paul Watson has conservatively, let's not exaggerate, 15 million views a week of his videos.
[01:49:20.856 --> 01:49:22.777]  Sometimes 30, 40, but let's say 15 on average.
[01:49:23.277 --> 01:49:25.038]  That's bigger than any CNN show.
[01:49:25.318 --> 01:49:29.880]  They're finally getting, because I'm not into the power trip, but they need to know you're the joke.
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:31.161]  You're the outsider.
[01:49:31.421 --> 01:49:32.421]  You're not listened to anymore.
[01:49:32.521 --> 01:49:33.182]  You're done.
[01:49:33.742 --> 01:49:35.843]  Don't start World War III trying to hold on to power.
[01:49:36.721 --> 01:49:43.827]  I will say this, though, the danger in that is, and look at the people where they closed Vine down this week, or they're closing it down.
[01:49:43.967 --> 01:49:46.089]  Oh, I know, oh no, I agree, they're coming after everybody.
[01:49:46.109 --> 01:49:57.178]  I mean, they've told Matt Grudge, they've told us, they're coming, that's what I'm saying, they're going to have to, that's the perfect form of totalitarianism, Matt, is that we're kicking their ass, they know it, they're falling apart, they're going to try to hold on to power.
[01:49:57.498 --> 01:49:58.659]  What, how do we counter that?
[01:49:59.448 --> 01:50:01.430]  Well, you've got to support these stations.
[01:50:01.470 --> 01:50:05.674]  You've got to get shows and networks like Alex's on more radio stations.
[01:50:05.694 --> 01:50:06.754]  I'll tell you another reason.
[01:50:07.155 --> 01:50:10.878]  They're eliminating the broadcast spectrum systematically.
[01:50:10.938 --> 01:50:14.822]  So, for instance, the television spectrum this year, I think this year, is going away.
[01:50:14.882 --> 01:50:21.948]  Channels 40 through 60 are going away, and then they're going to give them to the mainstream networks.
[01:50:22.248 --> 01:50:27.930]  Oh, I know, I know, listen, all our wireless mics don't even work anymore because they're getting rid of that spectrum.
[01:50:28.371 --> 01:50:31.272]  They're just giving it all to the big digitals and locals aren't getting it.
[01:50:31.832 --> 01:50:34.893]  And then what will happen is analog, there will be no analog.
[01:50:35.153 --> 01:50:40.136]  And it sounds like, you know, like, oh yeah, of course you care because you own a radio station in Chicago, let me tell you something.
[01:50:40.176 --> 01:50:43.197]  No, no, it's all programmed then, then they can kill any feed they want.
[01:50:43.797 --> 01:50:44.738]  They can kill it all.
[01:50:45.238 --> 01:50:48.319]  Not only can they kill it, but they can take out certain words.
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:50.961]  Let's explain that to people that don't know.
[01:50:51.621 --> 01:50:56.884]  Because they can hit one button and have a program enter the internet that erases my voice off the web in a matter of days.
[01:50:57.464 --> 01:51:00.446]  Where my algorithm, my voice, is deleted.
[01:51:01.386 --> 01:51:01.947]  So that's why.
[01:51:02.327 --> 01:51:03.187]  Save the info.
[01:51:03.227 --> 01:51:03.427]  Keep it.
[01:51:03.447 --> 01:51:05.348]  Because we think we're starting to win, folks.
[01:51:05.388 --> 01:51:08.070]  The empire is going to strike back and it's not going to be pretty.
[01:51:08.410 --> 01:51:09.371]  Matt Dubiel is our guest.
[01:51:09.391 --> 01:51:09.771]  Stay with us.
[01:51:11.616 --> 01:51:13.038]  I said to Donald, here's what they're doing.
[01:51:13.058 --> 01:51:14.359]  They're setting it up as follows.
[01:51:14.979 --> 01:51:18.123]  For three, four months they've been saying the Russians are hacking our elections.
[01:51:18.883 --> 01:51:22.927]  To protect our elections, which are sacred, we want to turn it over to DHS.
[01:51:22.947 --> 01:51:26.871]  The genius has given us one terrorist attack after another and has done nothing to stop it.
[01:51:26.891 --> 01:51:27.912]  He still has his job, right?
[01:51:28.433 --> 01:51:30.895]  So he wants to now make sure our elections are safe.
[01:51:31.216 --> 01:51:32.016]  Russians are hacking.
[01:51:32.737 --> 01:51:33.858]  Follow the bouncing ball.
[01:51:33.918 --> 01:51:34.498]  No proof.
[01:51:34.858 --> 01:51:52.927]  If Trump wins, which is highly likely by the way, which we can talk about in a minute or two or another time, Trump wins, government declares, oh we have evidence that the Russians hacked it, he's a friend of Putin, the election is null and void, we're going to recall another election in what, six months?
[01:51:52.987 --> 01:51:56.049]  Until then, Mr. Obama has graciously agreed
[01:51:57.009 --> 01:52:00.311]  To continue his public service in the United States of America.
[01:52:00.631 --> 01:52:01.431]  Thank you very much.
[01:52:01.491 --> 01:52:02.612]  We're not taking any questions.
[01:52:02.652 --> 01:52:03.112]  Goodbye.
[01:52:05.193 --> 01:52:13.898]  And we have Biden announcing they're going to launch a giant cyber attack on the Russians and saying if the Russians respond, they may respond militarily, which is a doctrine Hillary came out with two months ago.
[01:52:14.298 --> 01:52:16.579]  And suddenly NATO announced that's their new doctrine.
[01:52:16.819 --> 01:52:18.280]  She's literally calling the show.
[01:52:19.628 --> 01:52:22.489]  All I wanted to say was, I said it to Donald and he didn't take the bait.
[01:52:22.509 --> 01:52:23.109]  I'm glad he didn't.
[01:52:23.169 --> 01:52:26.570]  I said, don't even answer me, because they'll crucify you if you agree with me.
[01:52:27.550 --> 01:52:29.271]  They're going to steal the election.
[01:52:29.451 --> 01:52:30.231]  I'll make it simple.
[01:52:30.271 --> 01:52:33.012]  In the fifth grade, I ran for class president in Queens, New York.
[01:52:34.032 --> 01:52:34.953]  I was a funny kid.
[01:52:35.013 --> 01:52:35.873]  I was a wild kid.
[01:52:35.893 --> 01:52:36.633]  I was out of control.
[01:52:36.693 --> 01:52:38.214]  I won the election by a landslide.
[01:52:38.754 --> 01:52:42.635]  The teacher stood up and said, this election doesn't count.
[01:52:42.975 --> 01:52:46.179]  And she had another election, and I wasn't class president.
[01:52:46.599 --> 01:52:51.304]  So, hey, look, if it could be done in the fifth grade in the Bronx when I was a kid, why can't they do it to us now, right?
[01:52:51.344 --> 01:52:52.005]  We're just children.
[01:52:52.025 --> 01:52:53.627]  I had a similar thing happen.
[01:52:53.647 --> 01:53:00.434]  You know, when you really do things in this world, you start to learn how rigged they are, and it's just crazy to see them go, in terms of the same newscast.
[01:53:01.135 --> 01:53:02.456]  The Russians are rigging the election.
[01:53:02.776 --> 01:53:04.056]  We're having to bring in the U.N.
[01:53:04.076 --> 01:53:04.717]  to oversee it.
[01:53:04.757 --> 01:53:06.137]  And then, meanwhile, Trump's crazy.
[01:53:06.397 --> 01:53:09.859]  He says they're rigging the election, even as we catch election officials admitting the fraud.
[01:53:10.039 --> 01:53:11.380]  We do have a minute or two more if you've got it.
[01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:12.940]  Elaborate on what you're saying.
[01:53:13.140 --> 01:53:13.581]  I mean, I agree.
[01:53:13.601 --> 01:53:16.862]  The internal polls, I know from Trump, but also other big groups are doing internal polls.
[01:53:17.402 --> 01:53:19.483]  5, 10, 15 points ahead in most battleground states.
[01:53:19.803 --> 01:53:21.024]  He's going to win in a landslide.
[01:53:21.284 --> 01:53:24.966]  They're only creating the perception he's way behind, so we buy it right now.
[01:53:24.986 --> 01:53:25.846]  Do you concur with that?
[01:53:26.026 --> 01:53:27.627]  A. B. What happens when he gets in?
[01:53:28.530 --> 01:53:28.751]  100% right.
[01:53:28.771 --> 01:53:29.895]  You and I think the same way.
[01:53:29.936 --> 01:53:31.824]  I said that to Donald yesterday on my radio show.
[01:53:31.844 --> 01:53:32.065]  I said...
[01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:34.260]  Uh, Donald.
[01:53:34.521 --> 01:53:38.943]  I said, what they're doing is they're not trying to get Hillary, people to vote for Hillary.
[01:53:38.983 --> 01:53:40.925]  They've got all the people they could ever, ever get.
[01:53:40.945 --> 01:53:47.129]  I said, what they're trying to do is discourage Trump voters from voting by thinking that it's, it's over already.
[01:53:47.149 --> 01:53:49.751]  They're trying to make them think that he lost, that she won.
[01:53:49.771 --> 01:53:52.012]  So they're going to throw their hands up and not vote for him.
[01:53:52.272 --> 01:53:55.795]  He's got to make sure that people think he can still win, which he can.
[01:53:56.715 --> 01:54:01.578]  And then if all of us who are supporting him come out, I think he will win.
[01:54:01.798 --> 01:54:02.459]  It's that simple.
[01:54:02.639 --> 01:54:04.180]  That's right, you can't steal landslides.
[01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:08.701]  I've interviewed experts who are Democrats, Republicans, die-bold engineers from the highest levels.
[01:54:08.721 --> 01:54:09.161]  They agree.
[01:54:09.842 --> 01:54:11.522]  You cannot steal a landslide.
[01:54:16.624 --> 01:54:18.945]  Well, the FBI has just come out in the last 30 minutes.
[01:54:19.005 --> 01:54:20.506]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:54:21.126 --> 01:54:22.266]  Don Salazar has written about it.
[01:54:23.147 --> 01:54:29.109]  Breaking FBI reopens investigation to Clinton emails because it's so cut-and-dry illegal on so many fronts because
[01:54:30.302 --> 01:54:31.063]  No exaggeration.
[01:54:31.203 --> 01:54:35.527]  Thousands of crimes have been committed with these emails and with the secrets and all the rest of it.
[01:54:35.547 --> 01:54:37.428]  The lying to Congress, the lying to the people.
[01:54:38.909 --> 01:54:41.592]  The emails saying, we've got to cover this up, we've got to clean it up.
[01:54:41.632 --> 01:54:43.814]  We've got, oh my God, the president's been talking on this.
[01:54:44.174 --> 01:54:49.979]  We've got Podesta saying, who told her she can use this and cut off the classifications?
[01:54:50.019 --> 01:54:50.920]  This is insane.
[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:52.761]  We should draw and quarter.
[01:54:52.781 --> 01:54:53.502]  That means kill.
[01:54:54.983 --> 01:54:56.084]  Who ever told her to do this?
[01:54:56.104 --> 01:54:56.805]  Well, it was Hillary.
[01:54:58.971 --> 01:55:02.318]  That's how they ran the whole administration in Obama's first four years.
[01:55:02.799 --> 01:55:06.006]  Remember the head of the EPA had a fake name and fake server?
[01:55:06.046 --> 01:55:07.549]  This is what they all do.
[01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:09.673]  Obama has a gnome diploma.
[01:55:11.755 --> 01:55:13.517]  Support the broadcast.
[01:55:13.817 --> 01:55:15.539]  25% off on BrainForce running through this weekend.
[01:55:15.559 --> 01:55:20.644]  30 to 40%, at least 30, but it goes up to 40, on the high quality storable foods.
[01:55:20.944 --> 01:55:22.226]  Now's the time to take advantage of that.
[01:55:22.306 --> 01:55:23.767]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:55:24.528 --> 01:55:29.293]  And we have a Trump is my president red shirt to wear out so folks understand the numbers.
[01:55:29.733 --> 01:55:32.957]  Obviously on election day any red shirt will do, but we have that Trump is my president
[01:55:33.497 --> 01:55:36.400]  The ultimate red shirt at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:40.503]  Going back to Matt Dubiel of our great Chicago affiliate.
[01:55:40.543 --> 01:55:42.465]  We're almost out of time here and I have the Michael Moore clip.
[01:55:42.485 --> 01:55:44.046]  I'll have to get to that in the next segment after you leave us.
[01:55:44.466 --> 01:55:47.409]  I got Roger Stone who's on with us every day with the latest breaking news.
[01:55:47.849 --> 01:55:49.350]  Huge election fraud taking place.
[01:55:49.931 --> 01:55:56.036]  Do you think the establishment is smart and will back off and realize if they do steal it, it's going to bring them down faster?
[01:55:56.056 --> 01:55:58.138]  Because that looks like what's happening right now with the FBI.
[01:55:58.158 --> 01:56:01.620]  They wouldn't be doing this if they didn't understand they've got to do something now or lose all credibility.
[01:56:02.441 --> 01:56:04.382]  So, what I'm saying is, do you think they're going to try to steal it?
[01:56:04.542 --> 01:56:09.204]  I mean, it's already going on, but are they that crazy to do it in front of everybody with Trump challenging it?
[01:56:09.924 --> 01:56:13.406]  Or, will they be smart, let him get in, and then try to sabotage him?
[01:56:14.454 --> 01:56:19.017]  I think that they're probably going to, you know, the way things are, it's going to be a combination of both.
[01:56:19.057 --> 01:56:23.600]  But this bad, they don't even have to institute election rigging.
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:28.543]  It happens by people who are inept, processes that are bad.
[01:56:28.643 --> 01:56:37.029]  I mean, the fact that we have a guy like George Soros that owns a company that makes voting machines, and then he has a stake in other companies' voting machines.
[01:56:37.089 --> 01:56:38.110]  It's like, hello?
[01:56:38.530 --> 01:56:40.792]  You shouldn't be doing that on either side.
[01:56:40.812 --> 01:56:42.233]  And he's always been involved in it.
[01:56:42.253 --> 01:56:43.674]  He's been involved in these damn things for 30 years.
[01:56:44.714 --> 01:56:45.715]  It's ludicrous.
[01:56:46.616 --> 01:56:48.877]  Voting problems have been... It's a joke.
[01:56:49.017 --> 01:56:50.518]  I mean, the punchline is Chicago.
[01:56:50.958 --> 01:56:53.981]  So that's been happening for my entire life.
[01:56:54.061 --> 01:56:55.141]  Or the punchline's Texas.
[01:56:55.201 --> 01:56:55.582]  Exactly.
[01:56:55.602 --> 01:56:58.484]  So what do you make of Obama going, there's no such thing as this?
[01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:00.762]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[01:57:01.282 --> 01:57:07.270]  The mere fact that any human being would tell you that there's no such thing as that means that they've got something to hide.
[01:57:07.290 --> 01:57:14.639]  The transparent thing to say as the President, as the Secretary of State, would be like, you know what, we've had some problems and we're going to do everything possible.
[01:57:14.699 --> 01:57:15.300]  But they're not.
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:18.063]  They're saying it doesn't exist because they're, you know, they're
[01:57:18.764 --> 01:57:21.987]  But it gets crazier than they say it's a huge problem Russia's doing it.
[01:57:22.027 --> 01:57:26.070]  They say illegals are voting, we're signing them up to vote all over the country, but it doesn't exist.
[01:57:26.331 --> 01:57:27.191]  That's in Bloomberg today.
[01:57:27.211 --> 01:57:31.215]  They actually say in the same paragraph, we're doing it, but Trump's insane it isn't happening.
[01:57:31.676 --> 01:57:33.958]  They're master hypnotists, all of them.
[01:57:34.318 --> 01:57:37.922]  They're all master manipulators and linguists.
[01:57:38.062 --> 01:57:43.229]  They take the emotion from one thing and they project it onto something else and say, oh, I'm going to reframe this.
[01:57:43.349 --> 01:57:44.330]  This is the bad thing.
[01:57:44.590 --> 01:57:45.411]  So, so yes.
[01:57:45.751 --> 01:57:51.418]  And Trump does that a little bit, except you'll notice what he does is it's it's it's not.
[01:57:52.339 --> 01:57:57.501]  Manipulative, he'll go and say, oh, yes, you're right, that did happen, and here's why we're going to fix it.
[01:57:57.702 --> 01:57:59.142]  It's very different.
[01:57:59.462 --> 01:58:01.803]  It's something everyone needs to watch out for.
[01:58:02.104 --> 01:58:05.485]  It's, by the way, one of the reasons those mainstream media outlets are having trouble.
[01:58:05.785 --> 01:58:14.990]  It's because people have sort of woken up to this idea of, well, wait a minute, you're saying that that doesn't happen, but I know that happens, so...
[01:58:16.030 --> 01:58:16.833]  How does that work?
[01:58:16.934 --> 01:58:21.349]  It's all meant to make you feel alone and just buy the scam when they steal the election.
[01:58:21.811 --> 01:58:22.413]  That's what's happening.
[01:58:23.610 --> 01:58:28.974]  It's, it's, I tell you, people have to be, your, your job isn't just to vote on election day.
[01:58:29.354 --> 01:58:31.736]  It's to cast your vote and make sure that it was cast and recorded.
[01:58:31.756 --> 01:58:33.237]  Sure, it's a war against the media.
[01:58:33.357 --> 01:58:35.299]  It's, it's, it's, it's a huge awakening.
[01:58:35.319 --> 01:58:39.242]  WCKG.com, Matt Dubiel, you can hear his show as well.
[01:58:39.282 --> 01:58:39.762]  It's excellent.
[01:58:40.022 --> 01:58:46.167]  Thank you so much, my friend, and great job exposing, uh, first off, uh, what was happening with the stage riots in Chicago.
[01:58:46.187 --> 01:58:47.228]  You've been totally vindicated.
[01:58:47.568 --> 01:58:48.088]  God bless you.
[01:58:48.128 --> 01:58:49.549]  We'll be back with the third hour.
[01:58:49.569 --> 01:58:49.970]  Stay with us.
[01:58:51.496 --> 01:58:53.258]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:56.963]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:59:01.306 --> 01:59:06.569]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse, minor words, and his was action.
[01:59:07.149 --> 01:59:08.690]  His was what he's done to women.
[01:59:08.730 --> 01:59:14.392]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[01:59:14.612 --> 01:59:16.934]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[01:59:17.294 --> 01:59:23.477]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously, four of them here tonight.
[01:59:23.597 --> 01:59:28.899]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[01:59:39.741 --> 01:59:42.482]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[01:59:43.342 --> 01:59:44.782]  It's a fight for our minds.
[01:59:45.462 --> 01:59:47.383]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[01:59:47.723 --> 01:59:51.924]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.

[02:00:03.266 --> 02:00:05.927]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:19.076 --> 02:00:21.678]  It's a long way to the top if you want to live in a free country.
[02:00:22.558 --> 02:00:28.762]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.782 --> 02:00:31.404]  18 hours a day and wishing I had more energy.
[02:00:32.325 --> 02:00:39.169]  I tell you, it makes you want to cry sometimes, but that's more the reason why.
[02:00:39.189 --> 02:00:42.111]  The more you get hurt in a fight, the more you want to win.
[02:00:45.714 --> 02:00:50.355]  And the more you win, the more you know you're gonna take the title.
[02:00:54.196 --> 02:00:55.357]  Very exciting time to be alive.
[02:01:00.818 --> 02:01:01.679]  Broken bones!
[02:01:03.799 --> 02:01:04.419]  Gettin' took!
[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:06.360]  I'm here to tell ya!
[02:01:08.541 --> 02:01:09.761]  It's harder than it looks.
[02:01:12.742 --> 02:01:13.102]  Alright.
[02:01:14.501 --> 02:01:15.641]  We've got a bunch of this speech.
[02:01:15.661 --> 02:01:16.861]  He just gave it in New Hampshire.
[02:01:18.902 --> 02:01:27.363]  We're going to be coming up with some of that in the next segment because it's been posted in fullwars.com, Donald Trump's statement on the FBI situation.
[02:01:28.303 --> 02:01:29.804]  So all that is coming up.
[02:01:29.864 --> 02:01:31.444]  Roger Stone popping in as well.
[02:01:31.844 --> 02:01:37.045]  The FBI has come back out and said that it's going to reopen the investigation because of all the new evidence that they lied.
[02:01:37.785 --> 02:01:38.825]  It's totally open and shut.
[02:01:38.885 --> 02:01:42.866]  I don't even expect them to probably do anything, but they have to act like they are because it's so obvious.
[02:01:44.514 --> 02:01:47.416]  But again, we're forcing them to be corrupt out in the open.
[02:01:47.436 --> 02:01:50.098]  We're not just rolling over, oh, it's a conspiracy.
[02:01:50.519 --> 02:01:57.824]  Just five months ago, we have Hillary on tape, our reporter, Richard Reeves, saying, what about the report your email server was hacked?
[02:01:57.844 --> 02:01:59.525]  It's now admitted it was hacked.
[02:02:00.586 --> 02:02:01.907]  She goes, that's totally untrue.
[02:02:01.947 --> 02:02:03.969]  And her people all freak out when they hear info worse.
[02:02:04.389 --> 02:02:07.691]  And she recoils like a witch from a big bucket of water.
[02:02:08.392 --> 02:02:09.493]  Melting, I'm melting.
[02:02:11.772 --> 02:02:14.615]  And then now it's all out there, just over and over and over again.
[02:02:15.877 --> 02:02:30.875]  It's a very exciting time to be alive because the mainstream media is still somewhat delusional, but as they wake up to the fact that they have no credibility, it's quite a bizarre dance they're involved in.
[02:02:32.498 --> 02:02:34.379]  Okay, here's part of Trump's speech.
[02:02:34.399 --> 02:02:35.399]  We'll come back with more of it.
[02:02:35.419 --> 02:02:39.121]  A statement on Hillary Clinton and the FBI criminal investigation.
[02:02:39.181 --> 02:02:41.622]  I mean, she is dead in the gun sights.
[02:02:41.662 --> 02:02:42.082]  Here it is.
[02:02:42.903 --> 02:02:44.103]  Donald Trump is speaking.
[02:02:44.123 --> 02:02:44.844]  We're going to listen in.
[02:02:44.864 --> 02:02:45.164]  Alright.
[02:02:55.789 --> 02:02:56.529]  Thank you very much.
[02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:02.472]  We love New Hampshire, I can tell you that.
[02:03:06.014 --> 02:03:12.540]  I need to open with a very critical breaking news announcement.
[02:03:18.965 --> 02:03:29.453]  The FBI has just sent a letter to Congress informing them
[02:03:30.848 --> 02:03:43.332]  That they have discovered new emails pertaining to the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's investigation.
[02:03:57.932 --> 02:03:59.532]  Well, you hear that?
[02:03:59.552 --> 02:04:00.733]  That is a lust for justice.
[02:04:01.673 --> 02:04:03.013]  You're never gonna stop it.
[02:04:03.393 --> 02:04:15.136]  And they are reopening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America.
[02:04:15.656 --> 02:04:25.218]  She's an absolute rat.
[02:04:25.238 --> 02:04:27.038]  Hillary Clinton's corruption
[02:04:28.877 --> 02:04:32.981]  is on a scale we have never seen before.
[02:04:35.865 --> 02:04:42.031]  We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.
[02:04:42.532 --> 02:04:43.152]  Unbelievable.
[02:04:43.653 --> 02:04:46.596]  See, Russia has thrown off the very same oligarchs down in front of us.
[02:04:46.636 --> 02:04:47.277]  This is a big deal.
[02:04:49.107 --> 02:05:00.431]  That the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to write the horrible mistake that they made.
[02:05:01.451 --> 02:05:02.431]  We'll be back, folks.
[02:05:02.451 --> 02:05:03.252]  Let's pause it.
[02:05:03.312 --> 02:05:05.112]  I know it's live right now.
[02:05:05.132 --> 02:05:05.993]  We're gonna come back with more of this.
[02:05:06.033 --> 02:05:06.613]  This is epic.
[02:05:07.633 --> 02:05:08.994]  This is such a time to be alive.
[02:05:09.274 --> 02:05:09.534]  Wow.
[02:05:11.274 --> 02:05:12.955]  I'm gonna lay it out short, sweet.
[02:05:14.751 --> 02:05:20.395]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[02:05:21.115 --> 02:05:25.098]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[02:05:25.979 --> 02:05:28.180]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:29.441]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[02:05:29.461 --> 02:05:34.004]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat, or more.
[02:05:34.084 --> 02:05:35.886]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[02:05:36.526 --> 02:05:41.449]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22, when I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[02:05:41.549 --> 02:05:43.311]  It's actually scary.
[02:05:44.191 --> 02:05:54.260]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[02:05:55.281 --> 02:06:08.111]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.
[02:06:11.064 --> 02:06:18.170]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[02:06:18.531 --> 02:06:31.742]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[02:06:32.683 --> 02:06:43.936]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotics strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[02:06:44.577 --> 02:06:50.543]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[02:07:00.314 --> 02:07:08.523]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[02:07:11.934 --> 02:07:15.518]  Here's complete garbage from Caroline Winter at Bloomberg.com.
[02:07:15.758 --> 02:07:16.218]  Headline!
[02:07:16.399 --> 02:07:20.963]  Some cities want their immigrants to vote, but Caroline forgot a very important word in that headline.
[02:07:21.164 --> 02:07:21.724]  Illegal!
[02:07:21.904 --> 02:07:29.112]  San Francisco is the latest city to consider taking votes from non-citizens, people with a green card, visas, or no documentation at all.
[02:07:29.512 --> 02:07:30.193]  Got an ID?
[02:07:30.393 --> 02:07:30.593]  No.
[02:07:30.793 --> 02:07:31.494]  Got a green card?
[02:07:31.734 --> 02:07:31.914]  No.
[02:07:32.215 --> 02:07:32.795]  Got a visa?
[02:07:33.076 --> 02:07:33.236]  No.
[02:07:33.556 --> 02:07:34.177]  Are you a citizen?
[02:07:34.437 --> 02:07:34.637]  No.
[02:07:34.997 --> 02:07:35.877]  Okay, here's your ballot.
[02:07:36.217 --> 02:07:46.600]  They claim Russia is rigging or may interfere with the election through hacking, but if Russia really wanted to interfere, they would just fly millions of people over here to vote Donald Trump in battleground states.
[02:07:46.940 --> 02:07:49.921]  They'd have operatives inside voting hundreds of times for Trump.
[02:07:50.341 --> 02:07:51.762]  No hacking necessary!
[02:07:52.242 --> 02:07:59.184]  So now, anyone in the world can come here, get a free handout from the American taxpayers, and also vote in our elections.
[02:07:59.564 --> 02:08:03.585]  In that same story, Caroline Winter said there is no evidence of voter fraud.
[02:08:04.065 --> 02:08:06.610]  This is Owen Troyer from InfoWars.com
[02:08:11.098 --> 02:08:13.200]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[02:08:13.340 --> 02:08:14.160]  What does that mean?
[02:08:14.521 --> 02:08:15.241]  First of all, it's rigged.
[02:08:15.861 --> 02:08:17.563]  And I'm afraid the election's going to be rigged.
[02:08:17.583 --> 02:08:18.203]  I have to be honest.
[02:08:18.603 --> 02:08:22.146]  That somewhere between 2 and 5 percent of building vote voters... Betsy, please, I can't.
[02:08:22.206 --> 02:08:22.626]  I can't.
[02:08:22.726 --> 02:08:22.886]  ...vote.
[02:08:22.906 --> 02:08:27.029]  We've cited... No, don't... Stop, stop, stop, or I'm going to have to cut this interview short.
[02:08:27.290 --> 02:08:36.997]  Have you seen the recent videos that Project Veritas released showing Democratic operatives talking about how they've been working to commit election fraud?
[02:08:38.197 --> 02:08:40.979]  Um, well, we don't have election fraud in America.
[02:08:41.459 --> 02:08:50.023]  Well, a Pew Research report shows that one in eight voter registrations are, quote, significantly inaccurate or no longer valid.
[02:08:50.483 --> 02:08:55.845]  The corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism.
[02:08:56.566 --> 02:09:01.788]  And their agenda is to elect crooked Hillary Clinton.
[02:09:02.831 --> 02:09:08.915]  At any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy.
[02:09:10.015 --> 02:09:14.338]  I have presented the evidence to my viewers and my viewers trust me to tell them the truth.
[02:09:14.478 --> 02:09:16.999]  We try to fact check the candidates, people don't believe us.
[02:09:17.260 --> 02:09:22.022]  When we try to report on the candidates, people think they are not getting the straight scoop from us.
[02:09:22.223 --> 02:09:24.164]  We run elections and we run them well here.
[02:09:24.704 --> 02:09:28.726]  In 22 primaries, the votes have shifted in 20 of them.
[02:09:29.867 --> 02:09:32.508]  The exit polling data in New York State shifted 12%.
[02:09:32.628 --> 02:09:34.389]  A shift of 2% is fraud!
[02:09:49.015 --> 02:09:54.178]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios... There is no serious...
[02:09:56.052 --> 02:10:03.098]  There's a person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America's elections.
[02:10:03.759 --> 02:10:11.726]  Indiana State Police raided the group, the Indiana Voter Registration Project, in an investigation of alleged voter registration fraud that has grown to 56 counties.
[02:10:13.047 --> 02:10:17.991]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:10:18.331 --> 02:10:37.526]  After the release of the latest Project Veritas videos in particular, I want to draw your attention to Robert Kramer, a convicted felon who visited the White House according to reports 342 times, also met personally with the President some 47 times, the most recent occasion being in June of this year.
[02:10:50.558 --> 02:10:53.759]  Hide what you have to hide, tell what you have to tell.
[02:10:55.679 --> 02:10:59.621]  And now the FBI has to move the Justice Department.
[02:10:59.701 --> 02:11:03.142]  Loretta Lynch has to indict Hillary and all of them.
[02:11:04.282 --> 02:11:09.503]  Mr. Mook, the spokesman for Hillary, has just deleted his entire email.
[02:11:09.523 --> 02:11:10.584]  We can put that on screen.
[02:11:11.744 --> 02:11:13.905]  He has just deleted his entire Twitter.
[02:11:15.745 --> 02:11:19.026]  Now he has one tweet.
[02:11:21.561 --> 02:11:27.604]  Because he's got all those countless tweets that Hillary knew nothing and Hillary didn't know anything and she wasn't talking to Obama on the secret server.
[02:11:28.144 --> 02:11:30.165]  I mean, we got him six months ago saying that wasn't happening.
[02:11:31.165 --> 02:11:34.427]  So now the MOOC, Robbie MOOC, that's on screen, that's big news!
[02:11:35.167 --> 02:11:38.609]  Within ten minutes, we've confirmed the data stamps with our
[02:11:39.815 --> 02:11:52.520]  Hacker reporters, that's what they are, they're reporters, not hackers, that within minutes of the FBI announcement, boom, and we're looking at other Democratic Party operatives, looks like they're deleting everything right now too.
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:59.042]  So, you talk about a criminal operation, ladies and gentlemen, they are running for the hills.
[02:11:59.702 --> 02:12:02.264]  Trump gave a powerful speech that just ended a few minutes ago.
[02:12:02.284 --> 02:12:03.065]  I want to play a few minutes of it.
[02:12:03.085 --> 02:12:04.566]  We're getting Roger Stone on the phone right now.
[02:12:05.186 --> 02:12:10.310]  This is him in New Hampshire saying the FBI is reversing itself, being forced to go back after Hillary.
[02:12:10.891 --> 02:12:13.052]  Here he is to a crowd that was in rapture.
[02:12:13.072 --> 02:12:21.639]  I have great respect for the fact
[02:12:22.847 --> 02:12:34.175]  That the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to write the horrible mistake that they made.
[02:12:34.195 --> 02:12:42.842]  This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood.
[02:12:51.047 --> 02:12:57.569]  And it is everybody's hope that it is about to be corrected.
[02:12:57.589 --> 02:13:01.331]  Now she needs to be SWAT teamed right now.
[02:13:03.111 --> 02:13:04.292]  And media matters and all the rest of it.
[02:13:04.332 --> 02:13:05.952]  You've engaged in racketeering, it's clear.
[02:13:07.713 --> 02:13:09.033]  Leave the country now while you still can.
[02:13:09.053 --> 02:13:12.134]  So that is a big announcement that I heard ten minutes ago.
[02:13:14.075 --> 02:13:16.956]  And I guess obviously most of you folks have heard about.
[02:13:18.157 --> 02:13:36.546]  And in all fairness, for all of the people that have suffered for doing so much less, including just recently four-star General James Cartwright, General Petraeus, and many others, perhaps finally justice will be done.
[02:13:36.566 --> 02:13:41.489]  All right, more of this, more of this.
[02:13:41.509 --> 02:13:42.589]  We've got the whole thing recorded.
[02:13:42.609 --> 02:13:43.770]  I just sent it a few minutes ago.
[02:13:44.750 --> 02:13:45.991]  When I say edge of my seat,
[02:13:47.844 --> 02:13:52.066]  In my 42 years on this planet, about to be 43, I've never experienced anything like this.
[02:13:53.346 --> 02:14:15.455]  Roger Stone's been involved in nine campaigns, he's worked in the White House, went on four, two of them very close to the President, with the President, and partly was like best friends with Nixon after the administration, and he said Nixon was corrupt, Nixon did some bad things, but compared to this, I mean, the guy was an angel, he was actually doing it for American interest, and I'm not saying that's okay, but he really was trying to serve American interest.
[02:14:18.237 --> 02:14:19.698]  With these people, they're out to get the country.
[02:14:19.718 --> 02:14:21.260]  We have the WikiLeaks, we have the proof.
[02:14:21.580 --> 02:14:24.282]  We have them calling their constituents dumb idiots, calling black people dumb.
[02:14:24.382 --> 02:14:26.003]  I mean, by the minute it gets crazier.
[02:14:27.084 --> 02:14:31.768]  And there's tapes reportedly getting ready to come out of her calling black people the N-word, okay?
[02:14:32.329 --> 02:14:36.132]  We have all these witnesses already, but if the word is a couple days from now, you're going to hear that, okay?
[02:14:36.712 --> 02:14:39.675]  So that they think they've got stuff on Trump.
[02:14:39.755 --> 02:14:40.555]  Huh, give me a break.
[02:14:41.096 --> 02:14:42.397]  So he's only was the bottom of the hour.
[02:14:42.417 --> 02:14:44.759]  I appreciate him joining, especially every day until the election.
[02:14:44.939 --> 02:14:46.540]  We're only 10 days out right now.
[02:14:47.521 --> 02:14:48.842]  Such incredible things happening.
[02:14:49.363 --> 02:14:53.687]  Roger, I wanted to get into all the huge election fraud from Virginia to Florida to Maryland.
[02:14:53.747 --> 02:14:55.708]  Vote flipping confirmed on video.
[02:14:57.410 --> 02:15:04.116]  But first off, wow, what do you make of this with the smoking gun, obviously, WikiLeaks that they said, we got to cover this up.
[02:15:04.416 --> 02:15:07.038]  The president talking to her with a fake name, a gnome to bloom.
[02:15:07.499 --> 02:15:10.061]  I mean, this makes Nixon, again, look like an angel cake.
[02:15:10.381 --> 02:15:11.062]  What are they going to do?
[02:15:11.834 --> 02:15:28.134]  Yeah, let's remember, Nixon was removed for dirty tricks and other violations of the law during the 1972 re-election campaign run by the infamous committee to re-elect the president, where yours truly was the youngest staffer.
[02:15:29.585 --> 02:15:45.191]  And the Clintons are not being held to the same standard, neither in the monumental dirty tricks that they are perpetrating of inciting violence at the Trump rallies, which Hillary Clinton herself approved and pushed.
[02:15:45.331 --> 02:15:49.053]  I mean, we have no proof that Nixon ever knew about the break-in at the Watergate.
[02:15:49.413 --> 02:15:50.193]  Still unproved.
[02:15:51.701 --> 02:15:52.782]  There's no evidence of it.
[02:15:52.882 --> 02:16:04.126]  Jeb Magruder says no his entire life, and then the rat weasel, just before he dies, I think he needs a few bucks from a tabloid, he flips and says, oh, Nixon did now, which is nonsense.
[02:16:04.386 --> 02:16:09.007]  No one else, including John Dean, makes that assertion.
[02:16:09.808 --> 02:16:12.169]  So this is much more egregious.
[02:16:12.709 --> 02:16:18.691]  And what I tell you this means now with the FBI under such heavy pressure.
[02:16:19.645 --> 02:16:27.891]  Through the citizen revolution in our communications, I think the globalists have decided that the Clintons' baggage is too great.
[02:16:28.591 --> 02:16:30.853]  Remember, the Clintons don't run the globalists.
[02:16:30.893 --> 02:16:35.836]  The globalists run and fund the Clintons, and they, too, may be expendable.
[02:16:40.086 --> 02:16:40.706]  Please continue.
[02:16:41.326 --> 02:16:52.490]  You know, the interesting thing is that this comes about, Alex, at a time where Donald Trump is clearly picking up the momentum in this race.
[02:16:53.211 --> 02:16:57.892]  I mean, look at the landscape here, and it's extraordinary.
[02:16:58.432 --> 02:16:59.933]  Nevada, a toss-up.
[02:17:00.353 --> 02:17:02.014]  Ohio, a toss-up.
[02:17:02.534 --> 02:17:05.435]  Florida, new pullout with Trump, up four points.
[02:17:06.252 --> 02:17:12.277]  Very encouraging, but I think if you took all the polls and looked at it, a toss-up.
[02:17:13.918 --> 02:17:21.224]  This is also true in New Hampshire, which I think has got to be watched carefully.
[02:17:21.664 --> 02:17:22.965]  Maine, a toss-up.
[02:17:24.186 --> 02:17:33.754]  And then, who moves into this, but just this last week, Real Clear Politics makes Pennsylvania a toss-up.
[02:17:33.874 --> 02:17:34.794]  Now, Alex, let me tell you.
[02:17:36.056 --> 02:17:40.059]  Single best field general in the Trump army.
[02:17:40.919 --> 02:17:55.309]  A guy who is a West Point graduate and one tough veteran, David Urban, probably the toughest political operative, one of the most organized, buttoned down, focused professionals I've had the honor of working with.
[02:17:56.430 --> 02:18:02.514]  Deeply, once the chief of staff for one of your friends, Alex, Senator Arlen Specter.
[02:18:03.794 --> 02:18:12.517]  And an enormously resourceful and combative general, and Pennsylvania, under his command, can come through.
[02:18:13.258 --> 02:18:18.599]  This is a state that eluded Romney, eluded McCain, eluded Bush, the junior.
[02:18:18.619 --> 02:18:25.162]  Enormous, millions of dollars of resources thrown at it, and they've never been able to break the lock.
[02:18:25.282 --> 02:18:31.464]  The problem is that the city of Philadelphia will produce an enormous margin for Hillary Clinton.
[02:18:32.136 --> 02:18:40.200]  The collar counties outside Philadelphia, which used to be reliably Republican, have moved left.
[02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:55.487]  As white people have fled the city, and then more affluent middle-class blacks have fled the city, and they move out to the suburbs because it's cleaner and it's safer, the quality of life is greater, they maintain their Democratic registration.
[02:18:57.267 --> 02:19:00.369]  Central Pennsylvania is as right-wing as some parts of Alabama.
[02:19:01.167 --> 02:19:08.234]  And then Western Pennsylvania is blue-collar, Democrat, Catholic, Eastern European.
[02:19:08.994 --> 02:19:13.599]  And Trump has an appeal there that no Republican since Reagan has had.
[02:19:14.199 --> 02:19:19.104]  And that is why Pennsylvania, the crown jewel of this campaign, is heads up.
[02:19:19.795 --> 02:19:30.465]  Terrific story today, I think it was by ABC, about the study done showing that Pennsylvania has more dead people on the voter rolls than any other state, Alex.
[02:19:30.885 --> 02:19:32.507]  Now, I want to go to these demographics.
[02:19:32.527 --> 02:19:33.828]  We've only got 10 minutes left with you.
[02:19:33.888 --> 02:19:39.594]  Again, Roger Stone, StoneColdTruth.com, former head of the Trump campaign, here with us, looking at this stuff.
[02:19:40.748 --> 02:19:44.310]  Going back five minutes ago to what you said, because even before you joined us, that's what I was saying on air.
[02:19:44.350 --> 02:19:45.270]  That's the general feeling.
[02:19:46.431 --> 02:19:47.991]  I mean, the look in Trump's eyes, all of it.
[02:19:48.011 --> 02:19:52.093]  The FBI wouldn't have reversed itself if all this new evidence hadn't come out.
[02:19:52.373 --> 02:19:53.914]  They've now got to do something.
[02:19:53.954 --> 02:19:56.275]  Even in the court of public opinion, this is devastating.
[02:19:56.655 --> 02:19:57.255]  And I agree.
[02:19:58.356 --> 02:20:01.837]  The power structure now knows it's more damage to put Hillary in.
[02:20:02.438 --> 02:20:05.439]  Like we said earlier this week, she's like a dead body going over the finish line.
[02:20:06.912 --> 02:20:08.453]  So what do you expect to happen now?
[02:20:08.754 --> 02:20:15.059]  Or does she control the apparatus of the party so much that even the globalist won't be able to stop her trying to steal it?
[02:20:15.079 --> 02:20:19.242]  I mean, this is the most epic next 10 days that I can even imagine.
[02:20:19.282 --> 02:20:20.463]  This is so edge of my seat.
[02:20:20.903 --> 02:20:24.926]  It's like sudden death overtime in a Super Bowl that goes on for 10 days.
[02:20:25.367 --> 02:20:30.571]  Well, it also may be the knife in the back from one Barack Hussein Obama.
[02:20:31.400 --> 02:20:41.227]  Who has no love for these people, who sees that Bill is out attacking his signature achievement, which unfortunately appears to be collapsing before our very eyes, Obamacare.
[02:20:41.887 --> 02:20:44.909]  Everything the critics having said about it turning out to be true.
[02:20:46.370 --> 02:20:56.777]  But this, let's remember that Loretta Lynch, and Comey, and everybody who has led the governmental cover-up for Hillary,
[02:20:57.783 --> 02:21:01.386]  They all report to and answer to the President of the United States.
[02:21:02.927 --> 02:21:08.472]  It is unlikely, I mean, this is clearly a decision that would go all the way to the top.
[02:21:09.273 --> 02:21:12.155]  Comey's original decision should not have shocked anybody.
[02:21:12.175 --> 02:21:16.599]  He covered up for the Clintons as an Assistant Attorney General in the Sandy Berger affair.
[02:21:17.439 --> 02:21:26.547]  When Berger stuffed national security documents down the front of his pants, they showed that Bill Clinton could have killed bin Laden and he tried to smuggle them out of the National Archives and he got busted.
[02:21:27.549 --> 02:21:28.430]  Nobody went to jail.
[02:21:28.930 --> 02:21:48.008]  Then he covered for them for the Mark Rich pardon, when Mark Rich, the fugitive, Sonny and Cyr, and his partner, a guy named Pincus, arranged multi-million dollar contributions to the Clinton Foundation, and on the closing days of Bill's presidency, lo and behold, he gets a pardon.
[02:21:49.801 --> 02:21:56.063]  So, it is extraordinary that Trump already had the momentum.
[02:21:56.123 --> 02:21:57.584]  This is moving Trump's way.
[02:21:57.684 --> 02:22:02.145]  Now this event, which has to be the biggest bombshell of this campaign.
[02:22:02.165 --> 02:22:02.745]  I agree.
[02:22:02.925 --> 02:22:04.526]  This just adds accelerant to it.
[02:22:05.126 --> 02:22:07.827]  It's like pouring gasoline on a prairie fire.
[02:22:08.067 --> 02:22:09.728]  And Trump has lit a fire.
[02:22:10.588 --> 02:22:17.090]  And, you know, I have, as my friend Steve Bannon would say, this is epic.
[02:22:17.827 --> 02:22:23.974]  This is epic, so let's, as the wolf says in Pulp Fiction, let's not start, you know, wutting yet.
[02:22:24.454 --> 02:22:25.695]  And we don't have this in the bag yet.
[02:22:25.755 --> 02:22:27.157]  How does the empire strike back?
[02:22:27.677 --> 02:22:28.498]  False flags?
[02:22:28.618 --> 02:22:29.059]  Wars?
[02:22:29.539 --> 02:22:35.866]  I mean, if Hillary and her controllers have shown one thing, they are full of psychotic hubris.
[02:22:36.307 --> 02:22:37.368]  So what do they pull next?
[02:22:38.422 --> 02:22:58.888]  You know, I think in the end it's important to note that the sum total of all this information, James O'Keefe's incredible videos at Project Veritas, the leaks of WikiLeaks, which only weeks ago our critics, Alex, were saying they will amount to nothing, Assange is in retreat.
[02:23:00.509 --> 02:23:03.190]  Just what we've seen so far is incredible.
[02:23:03.330 --> 02:23:06.011]  The press of the United States knew she was lying about her email.
[02:23:06.251 --> 02:23:06.771]  Incredible.
[02:23:07.532 --> 02:23:13.996]  Doug Band is talking about how the Clintons can enrich themselves.
[02:23:14.036 --> 02:23:16.998]  The greed is a key, key issue.
[02:23:17.018 --> 02:23:21.681]  Sure, so thousands of wounds, one of which should be fatal if we had justice in this country.
[02:23:21.701 --> 02:23:22.622]  There's no way to survive it.
[02:23:22.882 --> 02:23:25.424]  They have been roasted in the court of public opinion.
[02:23:25.444 --> 02:23:28.306]  They have been burned like Count Dracula at high noon.
[02:23:29.206 --> 02:23:32.828]  Well, I think that may be a little bit of an overstatement.
[02:23:32.868 --> 02:23:35.070]  Here's where I think we are, which is the old media.
[02:23:36.187 --> 02:23:37.608]  Is losing power rapidly.
[02:23:38.348 --> 02:23:43.471]  The new media, mass communications through the internet, talk radio, and so on.
[02:23:43.972 --> 02:23:51.856]  As cable and network and the mainstream media newspapers are losing their power, the alternative media is gaining power.
[02:23:52.597 --> 02:23:53.777]  Where is the tipping point?
[02:23:54.118 --> 02:23:56.499]  We know the inexorable outcome.
[02:23:57.460 --> 02:23:59.181]  Their ratings are dropping like a rock.
[02:24:00.101 --> 02:24:01.882]  Because people don't believe them anymore.
[02:24:01.962 --> 02:24:04.564]  The first election in the nine that I've been involved in, in which
[02:24:05.296 --> 02:24:26.467]  The voters are totally on to the media, at least 50% of them, and for the first time they're taking at face value the nasty paid television commercial, which has been, you know, the negative commercial, which has been a staple of American politics and a very, very effective device in moving public opinion.
[02:24:27.456 --> 02:24:33.120]  Through the broadcast and cable media, it is clear that even that is a diner store.
[02:24:33.521 --> 02:24:45.549]  Sure, well to be clear, I'm not saying we've won the war, even this current battle, but clearly the initiative, the awakenings there, and they've suffered so many wounds in the court of public opinion that there's no way to reverse this.
[02:24:45.589 --> 02:24:47.130]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:24:47.651 --> 02:24:50.593]  So they, which means they revert back to plan A.
[02:24:51.294 --> 02:24:51.754]  Steal it!
[02:24:52.955 --> 02:25:19.229]  So, this is why we survived a, I guess my guys called it a DDSO hack, into the website for vote protectors and Stop the Steal, where we're trying to tweak it to take on this great democratic experiment of conducting a completely neutral, scientifically valid exit poll outside 7,000 key precincts.
[02:25:21.556 --> 02:25:30.820]  So that we can compare the results with the actual reported results and see if there's any pattern that would show that there was manipulation.
[02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:32.220]  I would point out that the U.S.
[02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:34.941]  State Department, under Hillary Clinton, has a standard.
[02:25:35.581 --> 02:25:43.565]  When the government takes exit polls, which they do, to judge the integrity of foreign elections, the deviance cannot be more than 2%.
[02:25:45.031 --> 02:25:45.251]  Sure.
[02:25:45.371 --> 02:25:47.673]  Our audience is more about strategy, Roger, as you know.
[02:25:47.733 --> 02:25:48.894]  They understand what's going on.
[02:25:49.175 --> 02:25:50.976]  The fraud and flipping's coming out everywhere.
[02:25:51.397 --> 02:25:53.819]  Trump's done the right thing by pointing it out so he can fight it.
[02:25:55.220 --> 02:26:01.265]  If there's massive evidence and you have the exit polls and we already have the videos coming in of vote flipping, what happens on November 9th then?
[02:26:01.285 --> 02:26:02.566]  I guess lawsuits are filed.
[02:26:03.167 --> 02:26:04.868]  Well, first of all, we don't know what happens.
[02:26:05.009 --> 02:26:10.193]  I would remind you that Richard Nixon won a 49-state landslide in 1972.
[02:26:12.065 --> 02:26:15.590]  Roughly 18 months later, they ran him out of town on a rail.
[02:26:16.732 --> 02:26:19.216]  The toothpaste is out of the tube on the Clintons.
[02:26:19.516 --> 02:26:21.619]  None of these issues will go away.
[02:26:21.679 --> 02:26:27.428]  They're not cleansed by her stealing a contested election or even a close election.
[02:26:28.306 --> 02:26:31.549]  Do they really think that any of this will stop?
[02:26:32.350 --> 02:26:33.751]  The prairie fire has been lit.
[02:26:33.791 --> 02:26:35.233]  No, that's why I'm saying they're done.
[02:26:35.373 --> 02:26:36.394]  They're done.
[02:26:36.494 --> 02:26:46.764]  They are, ultimately, but the toughest battles are yet ahead because people with this kind of power and this kind of money are going to hold out like Hitler in his bunker.
[02:26:47.164 --> 02:26:48.585]  Right, they're going to go down hard.
[02:26:52.463 --> 02:26:59.590]  If you look at any of these outlets, like Fox and CNN, they now are identical to the network.
[02:26:59.770 --> 02:27:08.159]  Oh, they're toeing the line worse than ever, and it's so sad that the media is so controlled that they don't get they're all destroying their careers following their boss's orders.
[02:27:08.938 --> 02:27:15.324]  Meanwhile, outlets like Newsmax are blocking James O'Keefe.
[02:27:15.344 --> 02:27:21.910]  They've taken down all their archives about the extraordinary investigative work they did in the 80s.
[02:27:22.010 --> 02:27:22.330]  Gone.
[02:27:23.011 --> 02:27:27.835]  So they're right behind Fox and becoming, you know, muted, sadly.
[02:27:28.271 --> 02:27:33.213]  Well, that's because they've been told they're bringing in authoritarianism, they're going to shut Drudge, Infowars, all of us down.
[02:27:33.534 --> 02:27:38.416]  They, out of fear, have joined with Soron, not knowing we're going to kick the Dark Lord's ass.
[02:27:39.116 --> 02:27:51.543]  By the way, Alex, I'm glad you raised an interesting point here, and that is Richard Johnson, great reporter with the New York Post, has a story talking about the fact that I will write a book about this election.
[02:27:51.683 --> 02:27:53.844]  I actually don't think my NDA
[02:27:55.087 --> 02:28:03.334]  Uh, that I have with the Trump campaign is enforceable, but it's a moot point because in all honesty, I would not write a book trashing Donald Trump.
[02:28:03.374 --> 02:28:07.938]  He's one of my oldest friends and he has played a valiant role here.
[02:28:07.958 --> 02:28:22.149]  Uh, you know, the credit goes to the man in the arena, not the guy who sits on the sidelines and points out where the strong man could have done better, but the guy who actually gets in there and fought and he has worked like a demon
[02:28:22.802 --> 02:28:25.723]  To overtake the globalists and to win this election.
[02:28:25.763 --> 02:28:33.005]  So the idea, and this may just be a miscommunication, that I would write some tell-all, it'll be a tell-all on this election.
[02:28:33.686 --> 02:28:40.088]  And there will be people who don't like this book, but I am not in the business of trashing a friend of 40 years.
[02:28:41.064 --> 02:28:42.285]  There's some things he's done great.
[02:28:42.325 --> 02:28:44.805]  There's some things that I would have done differently.
[02:28:44.866 --> 02:28:47.046]  But in those cases, Alex, I bite my tongue.
[02:28:47.346 --> 02:28:48.347]  Well, we're 10 days out.
[02:28:49.247 --> 02:28:50.368]  And I think he's going to win.
[02:28:50.768 --> 02:28:54.789]  He has run it his way, and he is closing in on this fast.
[02:28:54.889 --> 02:28:57.851]  I think the late momentum is with Trump.
[02:28:59.411 --> 02:29:05.734]  Roger Stone, I look forward to speaking to you again, hopefully this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., when I host the broadcast live.
[02:29:06.234 --> 02:29:07.434]  What an incredible time to be alive.
[02:29:07.494 --> 02:29:08.655]  StoneColdTruth.com.
[02:29:08.675 --> 02:29:08.955]  Thank you.
[02:29:09.858 --> 02:29:16.581]  Alex, on Sunday I'm going to give you a special report on Florida, because I really think the Trump campaign is on the move.
[02:29:17.381 --> 02:29:18.481]  All right, fantastic news.
[02:29:18.521 --> 02:29:19.101]  Thank you, Roger.
[02:29:19.882 --> 02:29:20.062]  Great.
[02:29:20.242 --> 02:29:20.662]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:29:21.302 --> 02:29:22.343]  And I want to explain this.
[02:29:22.363 --> 02:29:23.643]  This isn't about a power trip.
[02:29:24.563 --> 02:29:25.744]  People need to know the facts here.
[02:29:30.925 --> 02:29:33.266]  We are the Trump campaign.
[02:29:34.027 --> 02:29:35.367]  InfoWars, and the enemy knows that.
[02:29:35.927 --> 02:29:37.628]  They don't just say that and try to discredit Trump.
[02:29:38.129 --> 02:29:41.350]  They'll take our strengths and act like they're weaknesses, hoping that we desert each other.
[02:29:41.970 --> 02:29:42.551]  That's not happening.
[02:29:42.571 --> 02:29:43.191]  Trump's not stupid.
[02:29:44.111 --> 02:29:49.254]  Trump is riding the wave of populism that InfoWars is the heart and blood of.
[02:29:50.430 --> 02:29:52.392]  And so again, that's why I'm saying win, lose, or draw.
[02:29:52.453 --> 02:29:53.153]  We're winning.
[02:29:53.494 --> 02:29:54.395]  We're engaged.
[02:29:54.495 --> 02:29:55.256]  We're fighting.
[02:29:56.057 --> 02:29:57.018]  And you can feel it.
[02:29:57.098 --> 02:29:57.839]  You can see it.
[02:29:57.919 --> 02:29:58.880]  It's legendary.
[02:29:58.900 --> 02:29:59.401]  Stay with us.
[02:30:00.142 --> 02:30:01.063]  We're on the march.
[02:30:01.563 --> 02:30:03.165]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:04.086 --> 02:30:06.770]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:11.220 --> 02:30:13.643]  The quote he includes when emailing Podesta.
[02:30:13.703 --> 02:30:22.796]  This agreement, the Iran agreement, this agreement condemns the next generation to cleaning up a nuclear war in the Persian Gulf.
[02:30:23.156 --> 02:30:27.602]  This is the greatest appeasement since Chamberlain gave Czechoslovakia to Hitler.
[02:30:28.343 --> 02:30:33.765]  Now that is a stronger condemnation of a particular deal, as can be conceivably imagined.
[02:30:33.805 --> 02:30:43.947]  The idea that the deal might lead to a nuclear war, destroying the region, killing millions, raining blood and sand and oil down across the world, darkening the sunsets for half a generation.
[02:30:43.967 --> 02:30:45.108]  Don Podesta responded...
[02:30:46.108 --> 02:30:51.831]  Yep, Carlos Slim, a guy who's heavily involved in cell phone sales in Mexico.
[02:30:52.152 --> 02:30:58.155]  He wants a whole bunch of money coming from people who were Mexicans in America, the remittances going back to Mexico.
[02:30:58.495 --> 02:31:01.597]  Mexican government as a whole, it's even more...
[02:31:01.877 --> 02:31:06.082]  Remittances are worth even more for them than their oil trade.
[02:31:06.502 --> 02:31:16.313]  So, Carlos Slim, of course, owns a significant portion of the New York Times, and so he's going to oppose these kinds of closed borders, having a wall, and so on.
[02:31:16.854 --> 02:31:20.597]  So I think there is a kind of predictability, but again, the stakes have never been higher.
[02:31:20.617 --> 02:31:25.660]  I myself have wanted this fight since I was about 20.
[02:31:25.901 --> 02:31:28.903]  Let's just say that's quite a few years at this point.
[02:31:29.383 --> 02:31:30.324]  I have wanted this fight.
[02:31:30.404 --> 02:31:31.905]  I have wanted people to take on the media.
[02:31:32.205 --> 02:31:33.926]  I have wanted people to take on the Clintons.
[02:31:34.026 --> 02:31:38.830]  I have wanted people to forcefully go into this leftist nest and expose it for what it is.
[02:31:39.430 --> 02:31:41.412]  Finally, it is happening, baby.
[02:31:41.552 --> 02:31:43.253]  It is happening right before our eyes.
[02:31:43.654 --> 02:31:51.159]  I am springing out of bed like a caffeine catapult to work this kind of stuff during the day, because it has all come down to this.
[02:31:51.219 --> 02:31:52.600]  My whole life has prepared me for this.
[02:31:52.961 --> 02:31:53.681]  This is the moment.
[02:31:53.701 --> 02:31:55.462]  This is the time when people need to act.
[02:31:55.743 --> 02:31:58.645]  We need to start having an honest conversation about facts.
[02:31:59.025 --> 02:31:59.345]  We're good.
[02:32:15.040 --> 02:32:15.540]  It's happening
[02:32:31.032 --> 02:32:40.038]  We finally have the chance to bypass the gatekeepers, deal directly with the people, and bring the information they need directly to their neofrontal cortex for the first time in history.
[02:32:40.499 --> 02:32:48.644]  And by God, it is an exhilarating time to be alive, to be in contact with the planet, and I just, for those who are losing hope and so on, snap out of it!
[02:32:48.865 --> 02:32:51.987]  We've never had a better chance to get the facts across than we have now.
[02:32:52.467 --> 02:32:53.108]  Get moving!
[02:32:53.328 --> 02:32:54.048]  Get engaged!
[02:32:54.188 --> 02:32:55.449]  Get sharing information!
[02:32:55.769 --> 02:32:56.370]  Don't give up!
[02:32:56.610 --> 02:32:58.273]  Because that's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:32:58.293 --> 02:33:01.638]  The left wants to demoralize you and, oh, we can't win and it's over and so on.
[02:33:02.039 --> 02:33:02.800]  Forget all of that!
[02:33:03.001 --> 02:33:03.722]  Snap out of it!
[02:33:04.683 --> 02:33:07.428]  Give yourself a Don Corleone full-on smack across the face.
[02:33:07.588 --> 02:33:11.054]  Get out there and get busy because if it's not now, it's never.
[02:33:23.292 --> 02:33:24.938]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:25.441 --> 02:33:28.112]  Because there is a war on, on your mind.
[02:33:32.521 --> 02:33:34.162]  I'll give the social engineers credit.
[02:33:34.462 --> 02:33:37.543]  They have kept people in the dark to a great extent for a long time.
[02:33:38.263 --> 02:33:41.384]  They say there's no government corruption, there's no foreign banks, there's no new world order.
[02:33:41.864 --> 02:33:42.524]  Don't look at that.
[02:33:42.704 --> 02:33:44.064]  But now it's all out in the open.
[02:33:45.045 --> 02:33:47.726]  And their credibility is imploding all over the place.
[02:33:48.486 --> 02:33:50.706]  Anthony Gucciardi is going to be hosting the fourth hour today.
[02:33:50.726 --> 02:33:53.307]  He's going to play some large excerpts of Trump's latest speech in New Hampshire.
[02:33:53.327 --> 02:33:55.248]  But at the beginning of the speech he responded
[02:33:56.048 --> 02:34:15.024]  Uh, to the latest news that Hillary Clinton and the criminal investigation has been reopened because there's absolute, incontrovertible, open and shut evidence of them absconding the Congress, absconding the courts, absconding the FBI, covering up criminal activities, engaged in racketeering, organized crime practices, uh, covering up crimes.
[02:34:15.985 --> 02:34:16.546]  It's all there.
[02:34:16.566 --> 02:34:18.327]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:34:18.347 --> 02:34:22.992]  Breaking FBI reopens investigation into Clinton emails, which is unprecedented.
[02:34:23.532 --> 02:34:29.178]  But as Roger Stone said earlier, either way, it is seriously the end for these people.
[02:34:29.198 --> 02:34:31.180]  So let's blow up DrudgeReport.com.
[02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:33.022]  I should probably go over some of those headlines for people.
[02:34:33.262 --> 02:34:34.103]  In fact, we'll do that in a moment.
[02:34:34.123 --> 02:34:35.244]  A bunch of these I haven't gotten to.
[02:34:35.264 --> 02:34:40.129]  We should probably open the phones up as well and get your take on
[02:34:41.513 --> 02:34:46.514]  Where you see this race going and what you think of all the news of election fraud coming out.
[02:34:46.974 --> 02:34:48.274]  What's that new one that's in red?
[02:34:48.354 --> 02:34:49.655]  Blockbuster Audio?
[02:34:49.675 --> 02:34:52.195]  I want to see that.
[02:34:52.235 --> 02:34:52.795]  What's that say?
[02:34:53.816 --> 02:34:57.156]  It's terrible when they put the internet on screen because then I can't like move it myself.
[02:34:57.216 --> 02:34:58.116]  Let me just go look for myself.
[02:34:58.757 --> 02:35:02.497]  Audio emerges of Hillary Clinton proposing rigging Palestinian election.
[02:35:03.858 --> 02:35:05.658]  Oh my gosh, that's the New York Observer.
[02:35:07.596 --> 02:35:09.237]  I guess you cannot make it up.
[02:35:09.997 --> 02:35:20.440]  We have them rigging the polls, trying to rig this election, trying to get illegals to vote, trying to pass laws, saying illegals are going to vote, and then saying Trump's insane, they're not voting, in the same article!
[02:35:21.080 --> 02:35:23.020]  Next level weirdness, man!
[02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:25.201]  I don't even know what they're doing!
[02:35:27.342 --> 02:35:27.862]  Here's a quote.
[02:35:28.202 --> 02:35:29.482]  Oh my gosh, can we get the audio, please?
[02:35:30.322 --> 02:35:31.543]  I do not think we should have
[02:35:32.591 --> 02:35:34.513]  Push for an election in the Palestinian territories.
[02:35:34.934 --> 02:35:36.936]  I think that was a big mistake, said Senator Clinton.
[02:35:37.737 --> 02:35:45.065]  And if we're going to push for an election, we should have made sure that we did something to determine what was going to win.
[02:35:50.202 --> 02:35:58.765]  When I call Bernie supporters people in their mother's basement that are baristas, that's because the globalists set it up that way so you'd be a service person that can never actually control your own destiny.
[02:35:58.885 --> 02:36:00.305]  I don't get off on you being poor.
[02:36:00.625 --> 02:36:01.086]  They do.
[02:36:01.766 --> 02:36:04.787]  I'll openly tell you you've been dumbed down if you're one of those people.
[02:36:05.788 --> 02:36:10.750]  I mean, she dresses people up like supporters of Bernie that has them go attack Trump rallies.
[02:36:10.810 --> 02:36:11.691]  It's now confirmed.
[02:36:11.731 --> 02:36:12.471]  We told you first.
[02:36:12.791 --> 02:36:14.232]  And you just still don't care and you love Hillary.
[02:36:14.432 --> 02:36:15.192]  You're a dumbass!
[02:36:15.273 --> 02:36:16.053]  You're an idiot!
[02:36:16.093 --> 02:36:16.913]  You're a moron!
[02:36:17.173 --> 02:36:24.817]  And you don't have a right to take my country and flush it down the toilet because you think it's so horrible as you sit here in a lap of luxury compared to anybody else.
[02:36:26.778 --> 02:36:28.679]  Yeah, North Korea and places ain't doing too good.
[02:36:30.708 --> 02:36:31.709]  So we have the audio of that.
[02:36:31.729 --> 02:36:35.313]  We're going to play that after this because this video is up on Infowars.com.
[02:36:36.574 --> 02:36:40.858]  The headline is, this viral video has Hillary Clinton running scared.
[02:36:40.878 --> 02:36:43.401]  The wildest campaign ad you'll ever see.
[02:36:43.421 --> 02:36:46.204]  And I haven't checked since we started the show.
[02:36:46.224 --> 02:36:48.426]  Can we go to Facebook and see how many that version has?
[02:36:49.387 --> 02:36:51.529]  Again, people would think that I should be happy.
[02:36:52.732 --> 02:36:58.457]  Uh, that, you know, that had 700,000 views this morning and a few other copies on YouTube, another 300,000 or so.
[02:36:58.497 --> 02:36:59.398]  So yeah, it's a million views.
[02:36:59.478 --> 02:36:59.739]  Okay.
[02:37:00.099 --> 02:37:00.820]  Plus the 24 hours.
[02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:01.140]  Okay.
[02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:01.540]  Sounds great.
[02:37:02.481 --> 02:37:03.922]  I'm not happy with CNN numbers.
[02:37:04.022 --> 02:37:04.243]  Okay.
[02:37:04.343 --> 02:37:07.405]  I want 20 million views on this to devastate the enemy.
[02:37:08.386 --> 02:37:10.348]  So let's, let's go to our Facebook and see how many, okay.
[02:37:10.368 --> 02:37:10.448]  It's 823,000.
[02:37:10.508 --> 02:37:12.050]  Now see, we've only gone up 123,000 in the last three hours.
[02:37:18.277 --> 02:37:25.441]  I mean, and I'm not bitching, I'm not saying you haven't done a great job, I just, this is the most powerful campaign ad of the entire season.
[02:37:25.521 --> 02:37:26.542]  It's devastating.
[02:37:26.922 --> 02:37:29.284]  And it's a campaign to stop nuclear war, it's not even political.
[02:37:29.884 --> 02:37:34.066]  And it will reach liberals that still have some shred of sanity.
[02:37:34.647 --> 02:37:39.249]  It has the General's warning of World War III, it has the Russians' warning of it, it has Hillary saying she wants it.
[02:37:39.329 --> 02:37:41.391]  I mean, it's in her own words!
[02:37:43.052 --> 02:37:43.773]  It's powerful.
[02:37:44.613 --> 02:37:48.896]  It's ten times better than their disinfo piece they had in 1964 against Barry Goldwater.
[02:37:49.156 --> 02:37:55.240]  This time, though, it's not inverted reality against a great patriot, the grandfather of our whole reawakening of America.
[02:37:55.260 --> 02:37:56.181]  I've traced it back to him.
[02:37:57.702 --> 02:38:00.244]  You sit there and you look at this, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:00.824 --> 02:38:01.965]  This is the truth.
[02:38:02.445 --> 02:38:06.008]  We've taken the truth back from these lying monsters.
[02:38:08.524 --> 02:38:09.804]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:38:10.084 --> 02:38:11.205]  Please send it to your email.
[02:38:11.325 --> 02:38:12.285]  Please put it on Facebook.
[02:38:12.345 --> 02:38:13.125]  Please put it on Twitter.
[02:38:13.566 --> 02:38:15.466]  This is the video Hillary doesn't want you to see.
[02:38:15.846 --> 02:38:18.207]  This is the video that's got Hillary supporters waking up.
[02:38:19.427 --> 02:38:22.928]  And it's going super viral, so... I mean, it's pretty good.
[02:38:22.948 --> 02:38:27.330]  I don't know, something like 30 million, it's like 3 million in a day.
[02:38:27.710 --> 02:38:30.811]  It's only gotten, you know, a million, 200,000 I guess now total.
[02:38:31.791 --> 02:38:33.732]  And I'm not complaining, but it needs 20 million.
[02:38:33.872 --> 02:38:36.172]  It needs 20 million, 20 million, 20 million, 20 million, 20 million, 20 million.
[02:38:36.192 --> 02:38:36.412]  20 million!
[02:38:39.738 --> 02:38:41.340]  I just want everyone to go crazy with this video!
[02:38:41.420 --> 02:38:43.483]  Believe me, this is a weapon!
[02:38:44.924 --> 02:38:45.405]  Share it!
[02:38:45.545 --> 02:38:46.326]  Get it to everybody!
[02:38:46.346 --> 02:38:47.387]  832... 823,000 views is nothing!
[02:38:54.443 --> 02:39:00.266]  I mean, I do videos in my backyard that get like 5 million views, and I just, I go, oh, why did this video get that?
[02:39:00.366 --> 02:39:11.412]  And then this gold, this purity, this beauty, this veritas, this luscious little jewel just is thrown down the cliff to bounce into oblivion.
[02:39:12.513 --> 02:39:22.578]  Now, sure, a million views, 1,200,000 views, if you count all the videos where we've doppelganged it, is not chopped liver, but we need to go to the next level.
[02:39:29.128 --> 02:39:30.829]  I am just beside myself right now with happiness.
[02:39:31.169 --> 02:39:34.990]  I am very, very happy, though, that humanity is starting to wake up.
[02:39:35.490 --> 02:39:36.310]  Good things are happening.
[02:39:36.330 --> 02:39:38.811]  The whole con game of the globalists is falling apart.
[02:39:39.211 --> 02:39:45.393]  It's going to be rough ahead, but believe me, believe me, good things are starting to happen, and it's a very exciting time.
[02:39:47.253 --> 02:39:48.154]  They've tried to dumb us down.
[02:39:48.174 --> 02:39:49.374]  They've tried to remove us from the land.
[02:39:49.414 --> 02:39:50.694]  They've tried to turn us against each other.
[02:39:51.494 --> 02:39:54.135]  And that's always been the lesser scum doing that.
[02:39:54.155 --> 02:39:55.436]  We've had scum over us.
[02:39:55.456 --> 02:39:56.456]  That's going to start changing.
[02:39:57.366 --> 02:39:58.067]  This is just the beginning.
[02:39:58.087 --> 02:40:02.770]  Because we're rediscovering liberty, we're rediscovering what it is to be human.
[02:40:03.031 --> 02:40:11.057]  We're rediscovering the value we all have innately, just in being good people, and seeing the beauty of the night sky, and loving our families, and doing the right thing.
[02:40:11.157 --> 02:40:12.058]  That's the value.
[02:40:12.098 --> 02:40:13.179]  That's the wealth in this world.
[02:40:13.519 --> 02:40:16.402]  Then we attain wealth to defend that idea and be strong.
[02:40:16.662 --> 02:40:18.003]  Not because wealth's our god.
[02:40:18.303 --> 02:40:21.566]  Wealth is fuel and a tool to help others and help ourselves.
[02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:25.101]  Man, I read the globalist documents.
[02:40:25.121 --> 02:40:31.827]  We read them here and there about how they think of us as dumb and want us in the dark and it's all in the WikiLeaks and want to make us poor and hopeless.
[02:40:31.967 --> 02:40:33.408]  They use words like hopeless?
[02:40:34.509 --> 02:40:42.716]  That's like what's come out in Europe when top judges and stuff get caught running child kidnapping rings and they find little dead kids down in the bottom of a basement, you know, and a few of them are alive.
[02:40:42.736 --> 02:40:48.922]  And there's all these videos that the police see, but then they have to shut it down because it's national security.
[02:40:49.622 --> 02:40:51.023]  That's even mainstream British headlines.
[02:40:51.303 --> 02:40:53.565]  Giant pedophile network runs the government.
[02:40:53.965 --> 02:40:56.167]  Shut down because of national security because it'd bring down the whole government.
[02:40:56.787 --> 02:41:02.271]  And it's like three-year-olds begging for mommy and the globalists just go sit for hours and hear them beg and hear them hopeless.
[02:41:02.311 --> 02:41:02.971]  It's like music.
[02:41:03.011 --> 02:41:05.093]  Little crying three-year-olds begging for mommy.
[02:41:05.333 --> 02:41:06.434]  That they rape and torture.
[02:41:06.754 --> 02:41:07.835]  It's like music to them.
[02:41:07.855 --> 02:41:11.739]  And you're like, why would Gruber go on air and say, I love conning people.
[02:41:11.779 --> 02:41:12.560]  Let's hurt them.
[02:41:12.820 --> 02:41:13.721]  Let's screw them.
[02:41:14.001 --> 02:41:18.946]  It's just another extension of this people in ice cream trucks grabbing kids out of the back of yards.
[02:41:19.006 --> 02:41:21.128]  I mean, they're just a little less worse than that.
[02:41:22.189 --> 02:41:24.111]  They enjoy being dishonorable.
[02:41:25.332 --> 02:41:27.675]  I'll enjoy getting my hands around their neck politically.
[02:41:33.740 --> 02:41:35.981]  And man, let me tell you, I feel sorry for the mainstream media.
[02:41:36.582 --> 02:41:41.384]  The dishonor, the cowardice, the lies, to write the lies they do about me and Trump.
[02:41:41.404 --> 02:41:46.007]  Because let me tell you, there's few people that get to actually sit there and get the same treatment Trump's got.
[02:41:46.027 --> 02:41:48.108]  And I'm not complaining or saying, oh, look how big I am.
[02:41:48.388 --> 02:41:49.349]  I'm saying it means nothing.
[02:41:49.529 --> 02:41:50.389]  I'm glad they attacked me.
[02:41:50.409 --> 02:41:50.950]  They're scum.
[02:41:51.150 --> 02:41:52.931]  I'm glad the enemies of humanity don't like me.
[02:41:55.435 --> 02:41:56.196]  I said I'd take calls.
[02:41:56.236 --> 02:41:57.397]  Probably need to launch that phone system.
[02:41:57.417 --> 02:41:57.738]  800-259-9231.
[02:41:57.758 --> 02:41:57.798]  800-259-9231.
[02:41:57.818 --> 02:42:00.120]  But just, I thank my lucky stars every day that I'm not a scumbag.
[02:42:10.169 --> 02:42:13.831]  Oh, it's so... You people, all you care about is what people think about you.
[02:42:13.891 --> 02:42:15.612]  You globalists, you minions, you trendies.
[02:42:16.193 --> 02:42:18.354]  Thank God I'm not associated with you.
[02:42:18.714 --> 02:42:22.397]  Please, lie and demonize all you can.
[02:42:22.797 --> 02:42:24.038]  Separate me from you.
[02:42:24.358 --> 02:42:27.860]  Please, because let me tell you, I got a little bit of you in me and I'm ashamed of it.
[02:42:32.009 --> 02:42:34.590]  I mean, you people are a frickin' joke, man!
[02:42:35.110 --> 02:42:39.651]  You are the most scumbag, dishonorable filth the world has ever seen.
[02:42:40.651 --> 02:42:43.192]  You have it out for poor people to keep them poor?
[02:42:43.772 --> 02:42:48.553]  You want us hopeless?
[02:42:48.953 --> 02:42:49.333]  Why?
[02:42:49.573 --> 02:42:50.633]  I'm not putting up with you!
[02:42:50.653 --> 02:42:52.614]  And nobody else is, for that matter!
[02:42:55.414 --> 02:42:58.235]  And that's just a natural, God-given instinct.
[02:42:59.465 --> 02:43:03.688]  And that God-given instinct's coming back, and the more they try to suppress it, the more it's going to blow up in their face.
[02:43:03.708 --> 02:43:09.311]  I want to play the nuclear war video that's so important that's on Infowars.com.
[02:43:12.353 --> 02:43:20.958]  If they want me to do the third-party plugs, which I want to do, they've got to actually give me a folder, so they're always telling me to do that, and then I get it, and I need to, but I've got to have a folder to be able to do that.
[02:43:20.978 --> 02:43:23.320]  It might be in here, but I missed it.
[02:43:24.943 --> 02:43:26.644]  Yeah, we'll do it after the nuclear video, I guess.
[02:43:27.325 --> 02:43:28.586]  I'm not going to belabor this, Jenny.
[02:43:29.066 --> 02:43:30.567]  You need swimmable foods that are high quality.

[02:44:07.043 --> 02:44:08.645]  And they get up on TV and say, oh, it's horrible.
[02:44:08.665 --> 02:44:09.666]  He sells water filters.
[02:44:09.726 --> 02:44:10.606]  Oh, he's terrible.
[02:44:12.649 --> 02:44:14.150]  Oh, he sells seeds.
[02:44:14.390 --> 02:44:15.531]  He sells things.
[02:44:15.571 --> 02:44:17.533]  We've only got Prozac ads every other commercial.
[02:44:18.411 --> 02:44:19.152]  Just go to hell.
[02:44:19.192 --> 02:44:19.912]  We see right through you.
[02:44:20.733 --> 02:44:21.453]  The listeners get it.
[02:44:22.014 --> 02:44:24.655]  Solutions for Science is an amazing solar panel system.
[02:44:24.675 --> 02:44:29.018]  They can expand them out and their best-selling model, the Perfect Power Solar Generators are top of the line.
[02:44:29.879 --> 02:44:30.900]  I've got one personally.
[02:44:30.940 --> 02:44:32.641]  I've got another unit that's older as well I bought from them.
[02:44:33.541 --> 02:44:35.563]  It's expandable so you can make it as powerful as you want to.
[02:44:36.063 --> 02:44:37.224]  Normally $6,000.
[02:44:37.324 --> 02:44:38.205]  I can't believe they're doing this.
[02:44:38.565 --> 02:44:40.446]  They're letting them go for around $1,500.
[02:44:40.746 --> 02:44:42.688]  Visit powergridchaos.com.
[02:44:42.708 --> 02:44:45.650]  That's powergridchaos.com and get yours before they are gone.
[02:44:47.162 --> 02:44:49.128]  Gone, gone, gone!

[02:44:54.189 --> 02:44:57.130]  Will you and your family be protected when we have another economic meltdown?
[02:44:57.210 --> 02:44:58.571]  I believe an economic crash is coming.
[02:44:58.591 --> 02:45:00.992]  It's already happening in most of the world, and you should protect yourself with real money.
[02:45:01.592 --> 02:45:04.173]  Do you want to be a victim, or do you want to be prepared?
[02:45:04.233 --> 02:45:07.315]  Take action with the company I trust, United States Gold Vault, based right here in Texas.

[02:45:19.346 --> 02:45:21.588]  What you will need most in a financial crisis is money, not paper.
[02:45:21.628 --> 02:45:23.990]  I personally have secured my emergency backup with gold and silver.
[02:45:24.330 --> 02:45:25.191]  Don't wait until it's too late.

[02:45:37.201 --> 02:45:40.643]  United States Gold Vault, 844-321-ALEX.
[02:45:41.064 --> 02:45:42.545]  Okay, I want to go to a few phone calls.
[02:45:42.585 --> 02:45:46.008]  Since I mentioned it, here's the nuclear war video that is so critical.
[02:45:47.381 --> 02:45:52.243]  I want to thank everybody that's already sharing it, but let's get people to watch this.
[02:45:52.303 --> 02:45:54.044]  Let's send this out to everybody we know.
[02:45:54.104 --> 02:45:58.346]  Let's talk about why the world is warning of nuclear war if Hillary's elected.
[02:46:00.047 --> 02:46:00.988]  Let's be inventive.
[02:46:01.068 --> 02:46:02.568]  Let's get local TV to cover this.
[02:46:02.949 --> 02:46:04.069]  This is very newsworthy.
[02:46:06.490 --> 02:46:07.251]  Here's the report.
[02:46:07.881 --> 02:46:15.284]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[02:46:15.744 --> 02:46:23.407]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[02:46:23.667 --> 02:46:25.768]  As president, I will make it clear.
[02:46:26.628 --> 02:46:31.370]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[02:46:31.950 --> 02:46:37.313]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[02:46:37.373 --> 02:46:40.734]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[02:46:40.914 --> 02:46:43.715]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[02:46:43.775 --> 02:46:46.356]  We came, we saw, he died.
[02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:50.762]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[02:46:51.123 --> 02:46:54.587]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[02:46:54.807 --> 02:47:02.717]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[02:47:04.608 --> 02:47:05.088]  The U.S.
[02:47:05.128 --> 02:47:08.729]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[02:47:09.089 --> 02:47:16.712]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[02:47:17.072 --> 02:47:19.413]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[02:47:19.793 --> 02:47:22.694]  Of course not, because she's... Look, there's a really loud noise.
[02:47:24.094 --> 02:47:28.155]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[02:47:28.175 --> 02:47:30.396]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[02:47:34.249 --> 02:47:38.692]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[02:47:49.739 --> 02:47:51.760]  Trendies have been given everything.
[02:47:51.780 --> 02:47:53.621]  Now they're nihilists and want to die.
[02:47:54.181 --> 02:47:58.224]  But when the fires of hell begin to eat their flesh, they'll beg for their mommies.
[02:48:00.549 --> 02:48:01.370]  They always do.
[02:48:02.011 --> 02:48:02.732]  November 8th.
[02:48:02.853 --> 02:48:04.415]  Vote like the world depends on it.
[02:48:04.976 --> 02:48:06.338]  InfoWars.com.
[02:48:06.658 --> 02:48:09.582]  The front lines in the resistance against insanity.
[02:48:10.427 --> 02:48:13.089]  All right, I want to take some phone calls right now and into the next segment.
[02:48:13.810 --> 02:48:14.790]  Again, big news.
[02:48:15.030 --> 02:48:28.701]  Anthony Gutierrez will be playing clips of Trump's speech coming up in the next hour, and where he just an hour ago, 45 minutes ago, concluded a speech where he laid out the fact the FBI has been forced to reopen the investigation, smoking devastating guns.
[02:48:28.741 --> 02:48:29.401]  I said this on Monday.
[02:48:29.421 --> 02:48:30.962]  I said there's no way they can't go after her now.
[02:48:31.263 --> 02:48:35.326]  I mean, it's the entire criminal op, them admitting it's criminal, them admitting they're covering up.
[02:48:35.446 --> 02:48:39.769]  I mean, it's a whole new precedent when they're putting generals in jail for nothing.
[02:48:42.250 --> 02:48:44.271]  And then now they're going to let Hillary skate on this.
[02:48:44.311 --> 02:48:46.091]  This is unbelievable.
[02:48:46.311 --> 02:48:49.632]  But I'm telling you, the danger level is unprecedented.
[02:48:50.593 --> 02:48:55.814]  You can bet your boots, they are getting ready to stage some major crap.
[02:48:57.255 --> 02:48:59.996]  Blow up a federal building, say it was an Alex Jones listener, I don't know.
[02:49:00.036 --> 02:49:01.676]  Just get ready.
[02:49:02.557 --> 02:49:03.637]  These people don't give up.
[02:49:06.917 --> 02:49:11.481]  Alright, we've got Melvin and Chris and Frank and Josh and Chris and so many others.
[02:49:12.482 --> 02:49:13.743]  Let's go to Chris in PA.
[02:49:13.763 --> 02:49:14.644]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[02:49:17.006 --> 02:49:18.007]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[02:49:18.107 --> 02:49:18.487]  Good, brother.
[02:49:18.507 --> 02:49:23.131]  Hey, God bless you and your whole staff for everything you do.
[02:49:23.211 --> 02:49:24.713]  I listen to you every day, brother.
[02:49:25.453 --> 02:49:27.815]  My neighbor listens to you as well.
[02:49:27.875 --> 02:49:30.558]  There's quite a bit of us Alex Jones fans here.
[02:49:32.446 --> 02:49:36.189]  My neighbor's nephew was actually baby Trump in Pennsylvania.
[02:49:36.309 --> 02:49:37.871]  Awesome.
[02:49:38.291 --> 02:49:39.812]  So, awesome, awesome.
[02:49:40.433 --> 02:49:43.075]  But I say stick a fork in Hillary.
[02:49:43.115 --> 02:49:43.695]  She's done.
[02:49:43.715 --> 02:49:46.358]  I can't believe it.
[02:49:46.438 --> 02:49:49.921]  Well, who knows what curveball they've got, but I mean, I agree with you for all intents and purposes.
[02:49:50.301 --> 02:49:58.588]  They may be able to bring down Trump or assassinate him, but we've, it's like a battle where both get taken down and we win because we just, you know, we've got history on our side, but go ahead, sorry.
[02:50:00.234 --> 02:50:06.638]  Um, I, you know, I can't believe she's not in jail, and I would say she is really a sociopath.
[02:50:07.379 --> 02:50:13.883]  She has no feelings for any man, whether white, black, any color.
[02:50:13.923 --> 02:50:14.243]  I agree.
[02:50:14.283 --> 02:50:15.404]  What's the word in Pennsylvania?
[02:50:15.424 --> 02:50:17.765]  They now say it's two to four points in favor of Trump.
[02:50:19.366 --> 02:50:22.208]  Well, I'll be honest with you, Alex.
[02:50:22.268 --> 02:50:27.712]  Driving around, I talked to a lot of friends, and, you know, naturally,
[02:50:28.274 --> 02:50:34.020]  I don't know really anybody supporting Hillary other than, uh, there's a couple sheeple.
[02:50:34.541 --> 02:50:35.201]  I know!
[02:50:35.221 --> 02:50:36.042]  Same thing in Austin!
[02:50:36.062 --> 02:50:37.584]  I talk to Democrats, they're not supporting her!
[02:50:39.826 --> 02:50:47.374]  And if you drive around, I count the, uh, the signs, and I'm talking, there's probably like a 1 in 30
[02:50:50.832 --> 02:50:52.853]  Uh, probably even higher ratio.
[02:50:53.313 --> 02:50:55.114]  That actually our fourth... Amazing, Chris.
[02:50:55.134 --> 02:50:55.555]  Great points.
[02:50:55.615 --> 02:50:56.815]  And listen to me very carefully, Chris.
[02:50:57.195 --> 02:50:59.136]  It's gonna be you, the listeners, that are the game changers.
[02:50:59.937 --> 02:51:04.799]  Shoot a video, show the signs, talk about it, post it on YouTube.
[02:51:04.819 --> 02:51:07.561]  If everybody does that, this will take it over the top.
[02:51:11.127 --> 02:51:13.951]  We the people, picking up the tab for this guy.
[02:51:14.652 --> 02:51:17.075]  Put Molly in all her champagne.
[02:51:18.117 --> 02:51:19.499]  She ain't even know it.
[02:51:20.280 --> 02:51:23.364]  I took her home and I enjoyed that.
[02:51:24.185 --> 02:51:26.188]  She ain't even know it.
[02:51:26.929 --> 02:51:37.760]  So, Michelle, you mean he fed her a load of champagne, got her drunk, had sex with her when she passed out, and you're talking about Trump?
[02:51:38.061 --> 02:51:42.645]  Big Sean, another person they invite to the White House.
[02:51:43.266 --> 02:51:52.008]  That we the people pick up the tab for as she's shooting her mouth off around the country with this better-than-thou attitude.
[02:51:52.428 --> 02:51:53.668]  How low Trump is.
[02:51:54.229 --> 02:51:57.489]  Hey, when they go low, we go high.
[02:51:57.789 --> 02:51:58.830]  Yeah, they go high.
[02:51:59.150 --> 02:52:03.251]  They bring in the people that get the highest hit of anything.
[02:52:03.831 --> 02:52:07.232]  These people, Big Sean, you read some of his lyrics.
[02:52:07.292 --> 02:52:08.092]  Hear us some more.
[02:52:09.395 --> 02:52:11.257]  I believe in God and rubbers.
[02:52:11.737 --> 02:52:13.699]  Hey, Michelle!
[02:52:13.719 --> 02:52:16.722]  Did you have your kids out there when he was singing that?
[02:52:17.263 --> 02:52:19.245]  No, maybe for this next lyric.
[02:52:20.462 --> 02:52:28.764]  Even we sex you and not my lover, hit you on the couch and not the covers.
[02:52:29.424 --> 02:52:30.004]  Hey!
[02:52:30.264 --> 02:52:32.265]  You mean you'd do them anywhere, huh?
[02:52:32.605 --> 02:52:35.246]  Oh, and you're talking about Trump's dirty language?
[02:52:35.706 --> 02:52:37.286]  You hypocrite!
[02:52:37.706 --> 02:52:40.687]  And all you little prostitutes out there!
[02:52:41.047 --> 02:52:43.008]  Your little Anderson Coopers!
[02:52:43.608 --> 02:52:59.676]  All you little nobodies out there with big mouths that won't repeat these words or call out the Obamas for lying, freaky frauds they are to invite this scum into We The People's House!
[02:53:00.177 --> 02:53:02.198]  And if you bring your friend
[02:53:03.218 --> 02:53:05.099]  Then we got to eff her.
[02:53:05.539 --> 02:53:09.241]  Hey, you bring your friend, we got to eff her.
[02:53:09.301 --> 02:53:12.703]  Oh, are you gonna use the couch in the White House when you eff her?
[02:53:13.323 --> 02:53:14.924]  Hey, let's go on.
[02:53:16.925 --> 02:53:20.487]  My life is my odyssey, my dog's to the right of me.
[02:53:20.867 --> 02:53:23.609]  Oh, hey, that's what you call them?
[02:53:24.668 --> 02:53:26.913]  And he keeps going on and on.
[02:53:27.795 --> 02:53:29.959]  My mama say I'm a poet.
[02:53:30.099 --> 02:53:32.404]  Oh hey, mama said that you must be.
[02:53:33.266 --> 02:53:35.510]  You hating, praying, I blow it.
[02:53:36.670 --> 02:53:43.772]  But this life I made through, I show a bad bitch what she made for.
[02:53:43.792 --> 02:53:43.852]  Hey!
[02:53:45.953 --> 02:53:49.454]  You don't want your children to hear what Trump said?
[02:53:49.935 --> 02:53:51.275]  Of course not, Ms.
[02:53:51.335 --> 02:53:51.935]  Obama!
[02:53:52.275 --> 02:53:59.118]  That's why you invite these low-life rappers into We The People's house.
[02:53:59.198 --> 02:54:01.379]  My mama says I'm a poet.
[02:54:01.699 --> 02:54:03.359]  Call you on my cell phone.
[02:54:03.799 --> 02:54:05.480]  I call you on my cell phone.
[02:54:05.820 --> 02:54:07.202]  It ain't music, Jack!
[02:54:07.522 --> 02:54:08.523]  It's your attitude!
[02:54:08.543 --> 02:54:10.405]  There's not an instrument in it!
[02:54:22.512 --> 02:54:27.574]  If you are receiving this transmission, I keep telling you folks, it's not a slogan, it's the truth.
[02:54:28.275 --> 02:54:29.395]  You are the resistance.
[02:54:29.635 --> 02:54:30.415]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:54:30.756 --> 02:54:31.456]  I've studied history.
[02:54:32.236 --> 02:54:33.077]  I've studied the globalists.
[02:54:33.557 --> 02:54:34.477]  I know their weak spots.
[02:54:35.378 --> 02:54:39.920]  It's quite easy to defeat them as soon as we reach out to folks and let them know this is about self-determination.
[02:54:40.460 --> 02:54:46.702]  They attempt to put you into a psychological, cultural, but also physical trance in the final phases.
[02:54:46.722 --> 02:54:47.603]  This is mainstream news.
[02:54:49.169 --> 02:54:57.472]  The suggestibility of the general public, people are in a near sleep-like state, TV heads, they're just not alive really.
[02:54:57.732 --> 02:54:59.253]  They're in a coma.
[02:55:00.313 --> 02:55:02.514]  And that isn't rhetoric, that's what's going on.
[02:55:04.415 --> 02:55:06.956]  So, we're breaking the matrix here.
[02:55:07.756 --> 02:55:08.096]  Together.
[02:55:09.864 --> 02:55:20.033]  Believe me, the rabbit hole goes a lot deeper than Donald Trump, but it's a manifestation of the awakening, another wave in the awakening, and the animated contest of liberty.
[02:55:21.153 --> 02:55:22.875]  We're on your calls right now, right into the next hour.
[02:55:22.895 --> 02:55:25.077]  I want to just tell you about Harvest Right, harvestright.com.
[02:55:25.697 --> 02:55:30.061]  Amazing, incredible dehydrator systems, beautiful little systems as well.
[02:55:30.521 --> 02:55:32.063]  Look great as an appliance in the kitchen.
[02:55:32.143 --> 02:55:33.984]  I've got one, I bought one over a decade ago.
[02:55:34.004 --> 02:55:35.505]  I got another one recently.
[02:55:36.306 --> 02:55:37.627]  I'm trying to get them as a sponsor forever.
[02:55:37.667 --> 02:55:38.087]  We got them.
[02:55:38.487 --> 02:55:43.490]  Harvest Right created the most amazing home appliance, a home freeze dryer that helps you be prepared.
[02:55:43.870 --> 02:55:46.811]  This appliance allows you to freeze dry your own food at home.
[02:55:46.851 --> 02:55:48.852]  Freeze drying locks in 100% of the foods and nutrients.
[02:55:49.392 --> 02:55:52.314]  So even 25 years later, the food will be healthy and tasty as the day you made it.
[02:55:53.322 --> 02:55:57.447]  You can freeze-dry foods such as garden produce, proteins, and even whole meals like lasagna and beef stew.
[02:55:58.007 --> 02:56:01.972]  Harvest Right sent us some amazing freeze-dried food and their recipes, you name it.
[02:56:02.292 --> 02:56:04.555]  But I mean, I've got the system, so I don't even need to go off that.
[02:56:04.575 --> 02:56:05.235]  I know how good it is.
[02:56:05.656 --> 02:56:06.697]  HarvestRight.com or call 800-594-4635.
[02:56:06.717 --> 02:56:06.777]  800-594-4635.
[02:56:06.797 --> 02:56:07.298]  Harvest Right.
[02:56:14.853 --> 02:56:16.695]  Okay, let's continue with your phone calls here.
[02:56:17.295 --> 02:56:18.256]  Who's been holding the longest?
[02:56:18.276 --> 02:56:23.120]  Let's talk to Josh in Montana, listening on KMPT 930 AM.
[02:56:23.180 --> 02:56:24.060]  Josh, you're on the air.
[02:56:24.080 --> 02:56:24.701]  Thanks for calling.
[02:56:25.902 --> 02:56:27.363]  Alex, thanks so much for taking the call.
[02:56:27.403 --> 02:56:29.625]  I just wanted to let you know it's a pleasure to speak with you.
[02:56:29.985 --> 02:56:31.686]  I've been listening to you since I was about 14.
[02:56:31.766 --> 02:56:38.832]  There was a baseball game, you was in the outhouse, and your website was scratched into the side of the door.
[02:56:38.852 --> 02:56:42.555]  I went and looked at it, and I was awoken.
[02:56:44.397 --> 02:56:45.478]  I've got a question for you.
[02:56:46.619 --> 02:57:07.035]  Given that the reopening of this case against Hillary Clinton is coming so late in the campaign trail, just out of curiosity, say she does win the presidency, would she be able to grant herself clemency?
[02:57:09.342 --> 02:57:12.391]  Nixon tried that and it was just court of public opinion, he couldn't do it.
[02:57:13.554 --> 02:57:14.016]  And so...
[02:57:15.296 --> 02:57:24.923]  Unless she starts a giant war and somehow has a successful coup, and actually arrests everybody, which will totally blow up in her face, because we're active, we're exposing, people are ready for that.
[02:57:24.943 --> 02:57:27.325]  I mean, the military and police are just so ready.
[02:57:27.345 --> 02:57:29.446]  And again, they're not perfect, but they're America.
[02:57:29.627 --> 02:57:34.270]  The globe is trying to overthrow us, so we'll settle our differences later, after the dust settles.
[02:57:34.650 --> 02:57:39.554]  The issue is, we're not having a civil war because of a little piece of crap George Soros wants us to.
[02:57:41.175 --> 02:57:45.999]  Nobody wants this to go into a hot war, but believe me, the Patriots are ready.
[02:57:46.580 --> 02:57:49.643]  And if David Brock and all these people think they're going to get away with what they've done...
[02:57:51.988 --> 02:57:52.808]  They're just idiots!
[02:57:52.828 --> 02:57:59.310]  They took our restraint as weakness, our kindness for weakness, and the truth is, that is not what's happened.
[02:57:59.330 --> 02:58:02.690]  And they're just starting to get a little taste of things in the information war.
[02:58:02.730 --> 02:58:07.071]  I mean, there's, like, stuff ten times worse already planned for them that's non-physical.
[02:58:07.471 --> 02:58:09.372]  I mean, you think the stuff coming out now is bad?
[02:58:09.392 --> 02:58:10.032]  Ha ha!
[02:58:10.692 --> 02:58:15.153]  I mean, it's just, they're... People don't want to totally destroy the government doing this, though.
[02:58:15.553 --> 02:58:16.993]  But it's cancer, we gotta cut it out.
[02:58:17.053 --> 02:58:20.134]  So, if this therapy doesn't work, it's gonna get worse.
[02:58:21.257 --> 02:58:23.498]  We can't cut it out that it's going to go chemo radiation.
[02:58:23.858 --> 02:58:24.379]  See what I'm saying?
[02:58:25.499 --> 02:58:26.000]  Absolutely.
[02:58:27.760 --> 02:58:29.081]  So they want to bang heads, brother.
[02:58:29.962 --> 02:58:31.162]  They wanted to bang heads, didn't they?
[02:58:31.182 --> 02:58:33.583]  And now they're going to get to bang heads with us, aren't they?
[02:58:34.684 --> 02:58:35.505]  Absolutely, they are.
[02:58:35.825 --> 02:58:40.027]  And you look at Madeline Albright and Hillary and all these people, you think they can bang heads physically or metaphysically?
[02:58:41.607 --> 02:58:47.371]  Well, they've already been banging heads for a long time against innocent children, and God's physically striking them down as we speak.
[02:58:47.771 --> 02:58:49.952]  4th hour, straight ahead, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:49.972 --> 02:58:52.254]  If your station doesn't carry it, more of your calls straight ahead.

[02:58:53.875 --> 02:58:55.296]  I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:58:55.336 --> 02:58:55.836]  Central.
[02:59:01.030 --> 02:59:02.391]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:59:02.671 --> 02:59:03.951]  You can't survive without it.
[02:59:04.151 --> 02:59:05.052]  But where do you get it?

[03:00:02.754 --> 03:00:05.343]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:25.291 --> 03:00:29.775]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:00:30.156 --> 03:00:33.218]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:33.498 --> 03:00:37.602]  So what they do is they take pure tyranny and they repackage it as trendy.
[03:00:39.644 --> 03:00:46.330]  Hillary's now putting out sickening ads with women in the military saying Russia is homophobic, we're gonna take them on.
[03:00:46.350 --> 03:00:49.673]  I'm not joking, I've got the article right here.
[03:00:51.070 --> 03:00:54.012]  Saying, hashtag draft our daughters.
[03:00:54.332 --> 03:00:58.114]  Oh, make them slaves and make them be conscripted in the military.
[03:00:58.474 --> 03:00:59.214]  How liberal!
[03:01:00.215 --> 03:01:02.716]  Let's feed them directly into meat grinders.
[03:01:04.077 --> 03:01:09.759]  This is the state truly wetting our daughters, our women in front of us.
[03:01:11.060 --> 03:01:15.282]  Completely taking them away and selling it as a status symbol.
[03:01:18.124 --> 03:01:20.545]  You won't need freed college because you'll be dead in a doornail.
[03:01:21.613 --> 03:01:22.793]  Because I'm sending your kids to war.
[03:01:24.034 --> 03:01:25.575]  Oh, you found out those college degrees are worthless?
[03:01:26.035 --> 03:01:27.175]  Don't worry, sweetheart.
[03:01:27.876 --> 03:01:31.877]  Put on that helmet and Johnny comes, Jenny comes marching home again.
[03:01:32.037 --> 03:01:32.657]  Hoorah!
[03:01:32.898 --> 03:01:33.478]  Hoorah!
[03:01:33.718 --> 03:01:35.279]  When Jenny comes marching home again.
[03:01:35.459 --> 03:01:36.059]  Hoorah!
[03:01:36.239 --> 03:01:36.739]  Hoorah!
[03:01:37.019 --> 03:01:42.501]  I mean, this is, and it goes into, we're going to take on the uninclusive Russia and all the liberals are like, yeah!
[03:01:42.762 --> 03:01:43.662]  Yeah, war!
[03:01:43.942 --> 03:01:45.002]  Yeah, we'll show them!
[03:01:45.323 --> 03:01:45.643]  I mean, it's...
[03:01:50.503 --> 03:01:53.886]  And then all the weird liberals like defending radical Islam and mutilating women.
[03:01:53.926 --> 03:01:55.568]  I mean, this is a fruitcake group, folks.
[03:01:56.489 --> 03:02:01.674]  That story, Draft Our Daughters, Pro War Hillary Faces Backlash Over Female Draft.
[03:02:02.315 --> 03:02:06.619]  Remember Rahm Emanuel said we're going to have a national draft for everybody?
[03:02:07.100 --> 03:02:08.261]  National conscription.
[03:02:09.042 --> 03:02:09.843]  But it's liberal.
[03:02:09.923 --> 03:02:12.666]  See, it's liberal because he said so.
[03:02:12.706 --> 03:02:13.667]  And if he says it's liberal,
[03:02:14.600 --> 03:02:15.080]  It's liberal.
[03:02:15.100 --> 03:02:16.601]  I mean, they control reality.
[03:02:16.681 --> 03:02:18.502]  Rahm Emanuel is my god!
[03:02:18.922 --> 03:02:20.923]  He hops around like the Joker.
[03:02:22.564 --> 03:02:24.045]  He's a male ballerina.
[03:02:25.946 --> 03:02:26.686]  So it's okay.
[03:02:30.829 --> 03:02:33.570]  It's all these weird fruitcakes, man.
[03:02:34.210 --> 03:02:37.192]  But hey, maybe we're worse than them because these globalists run our lives.
[03:02:38.393 --> 03:02:38.773]  Obama.
[03:02:40.230 --> 03:02:43.352]  Michael Moore running around with six bodyguards and we can't own guns?
[03:02:43.372 --> 03:02:45.553]  I mean, just shut up, you hypocritical piece of crap!
[03:02:47.795 --> 03:02:48.715]  I'm gonna keep going a little bit here.
[03:02:48.735 --> 03:02:49.335]  We'll get you already.
[03:02:49.375 --> 03:02:50.316]  So, I'm gonna go to your call.
[03:02:50.376 --> 03:02:52.117]  Shannon in Florida.
[03:02:52.137 --> 03:02:52.577]  You're on the air.
[03:02:52.597 --> 03:02:52.918]  Go ahead.
[03:02:54.639 --> 03:02:55.439]  Hey, Alex.
[03:02:55.559 --> 03:03:00.702]  I just have to say I am so honored to even make it through your calling line.
[03:03:00.782 --> 03:03:01.783]  I am a first-time caller.
[03:03:01.803 --> 03:03:03.204]  I've been listening to you forever.
[03:03:03.244 --> 03:03:04.024]  You're amazing.
[03:03:04.064 --> 03:03:05.065]  Thank you for all you do.
[03:03:05.085 --> 03:03:06.546]  Well, you're sweet.
[03:03:06.686 --> 03:03:08.227]  What do you think of the whole Hillary thing?
[03:03:09.660 --> 03:03:20.850]  Oh my God, listen, I am streaming it live on CNN right now because apparently, according to the reporters on the Clinton News Network, they're saying that she did not have Wi-Fi on her plane.
[03:03:21.531 --> 03:03:27.576]  And so, I guess when this news broke, she was coming into this campaign stop in Iowa.
[03:03:28.408 --> 03:03:32.951]  Uh, she's speaking now, but they're not really letting you hear what she's saying.
[03:03:33.011 --> 03:03:35.113]  So what I'm saying... Well, of course, that's their cover!
[03:03:35.173 --> 03:03:36.034]  That's their cover!
[03:03:36.054 --> 03:03:39.776]  It's because it's not all perfectly scripted, so they don't know what to do.
[03:03:40.257 --> 03:03:43.399]  And so that's what they always... In fact, I was saying, oh, her speech is going right now.
[03:03:43.419 --> 03:03:43.999]  I said, what is she saying?
[03:03:44.019 --> 03:03:45.220]  And they said nothing about this.
[03:03:45.541 --> 03:03:48.503]  And I said, well, of course she's not, because she never responds.
[03:03:49.724 --> 03:03:51.585]  She never responds when she's hit with the proof.
[03:03:51.605 --> 03:03:52.826]  She just sits there and smiles.
[03:03:54.244 --> 03:03:57.925]  Yeah, and it's that creepy joker smile that you talk about all the time.
[03:03:57.966 --> 03:04:02.847]  But what I'm trying to figure out is, A, what does this really mean for the Trump campaign?
[03:04:02.867 --> 03:04:04.388]  I mean, obviously it's huge.
[03:04:04.728 --> 03:04:05.769]  Everybody knows this.
[03:04:05.829 --> 03:04:11.611]  I mean, but two, what I'm trying to figure out is what made Comey make this sudden flip?
[03:04:11.771 --> 03:04:13.732]  Why, why all of a sudden is he re-opening?
[03:04:13.752 --> 03:04:14.432]  I'll tell you why.
[03:04:14.792 --> 03:04:16.893]  Monday it came out that they said, we got to scrub this.
[03:04:16.913 --> 03:04:17.653]  We got to cover it up.
[03:04:18.013 --> 03:04:19.154]  The president was communicating.
[03:04:19.194 --> 03:04:19.934]  He's been caught lying.
[03:04:19.974 --> 03:04:20.534]  She's been caught lying.
[03:04:20.574 --> 03:04:20.994]  We have them.
[03:04:21.014 --> 03:04:21.915]  I mean, it's open and shut.
[03:04:22.982 --> 03:04:36.253]  It's like finding a dead woman in the back of some guy's car, the cops pull you over because you're speeding, and they see blood, so they pop the back of the truck, probable cause, and there's a dead body, and then they find a video camera in the front of the car with video of the guy killing the woman.
[03:04:37.034 --> 03:04:37.694]  What's that called?
[03:04:38.155 --> 03:04:39.135]  Open and shut.
[03:04:39.756 --> 03:04:40.597]  Open and shut.
[03:04:40.897 --> 03:04:44.160]  This is so open and shut, it's probably the definition of open and shut.
[03:04:44.400 --> 03:04:48.863]  And then all the absconding and the lying and the cover-ups and just all these other felonies.
[03:04:49.604 --> 03:04:50.265]  So she is
[03:04:52.659 --> 03:05:04.703]  Completely devastated and all the arrogant, crazy, narcissist, control freak, mainstream media people just kept betting and betting and betting and betting and believing because there were just thousands of reporters lying for that that gave them some cloak of invisibility.
[03:05:05.043 --> 03:05:09.025]  All it did was show them all as the lockstep little creatures they are.
[03:05:19.722 --> 03:05:23.926]  A CBS Chicago investigation finds dead people voting in Chicago.
[03:05:24.186 --> 03:05:28.691]  Susie Sally died in 1998, but voted in Chicago 12 years later.
[03:05:28.891 --> 03:05:30.612]  Victor Croswalk died in 1994.
[03:05:31.533 --> 03:05:32.995]  He's voted six times since.
[03:05:33.275 --> 03:05:38.640]  Floyd Stevens passed in 1993, but records have him showing up to the polls 11 times since then.
[03:05:38.880 --> 03:05:50.028]  Earl Smith, Tedesco Siesla are also amongst the 119 deceased voters that have cast ballots a total of 229 times in Chicago over the last decade.
[03:05:50.248 --> 03:05:51.449]  May they rest in peace.
[03:05:51.849 --> 03:05:56.472]  Jim Allen, a city election board spokesperson said, this isn't the bad old days.
[03:05:56.752 --> 03:06:00.835]  No, I guess it's the good new days where you can get away with election fraud.
[03:06:01.115 --> 03:06:06.139]  So CBS has now reported finding dead voters in Chicago, Denver, and Los Angeles.
[03:06:06.339 --> 03:06:06.960]  Where next?
[03:06:07.120 --> 03:06:09.602]  This is Owen Troyer for InfoWars.com.
[03:06:11.483 --> 03:06:22.032]  If you ever wanted to live off the grid and produce your own clean energy in a silent, reliable way, this is a message you want to pay very close attention to.
[03:06:22.352 --> 03:06:28.617]  Thanks to a new development in solar generator technology, it's now possible for my listeners and viewers
[03:06:28.937 --> 03:06:32.979]  ...to produce their own source of emergency backup electricity.
[03:06:33.379 --> 03:06:36.381]  And even more importantly, it's now extremely affordable.
[03:06:36.781 --> 03:06:44.125]  Thanks to the guys at Solutions for Science, you can get one of these $6,000 solar generators for less than $1,500.
[03:06:45.166 --> 03:06:47.527]  We have these units at the office and at my home.
[03:06:47.867 --> 03:06:53.250]  I can run my sump pumps, my shortwave radios, all of my devices, and even keep our food from spoiling.

[03:07:20.494 --> 03:07:28.738]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:07:28.898 --> 03:07:33.560]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:07:33.780 --> 03:07:40.504]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:40.564 --> 03:07:47.648]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:07:47.748 --> 03:07:49.549]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[03:07:49.649 --> 03:07:54.632]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:07:54.772 --> 03:07:59.135]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:07:59.255 --> 03:08:02.477]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:08:02.637 --> 03:08:08.760]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:08:08.920 --> 03:08:11.141]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:08:15.583 --> 03:08:24.447]  From the front lines... From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:25.948 --> 03:08:26.648]  Yeah, Hillary.
[03:08:28.042 --> 03:08:29.963]  Ha ha!
[03:08:30.303 --> 03:08:32.224]  Yeah, tell your children not to walk my way.
[03:08:32.764 --> 03:08:33.445]  Then what do they do?
[03:08:34.285 --> 03:08:35.245]  They walk my way.
[03:08:37.226 --> 03:08:38.527]  Yeah, mother.
[03:08:38.547 --> 03:08:44.329]  I'm gonna take your daughter out tonight!
[03:08:49.872 --> 03:08:50.612]  Oh, mother!
[03:08:57.341 --> 03:08:59.623]  Gonna take your daughter out tonight!
[03:09:00.945 --> 03:09:02.246]  Stop!
[03:09:02.266 --> 03:09:04.408]  I've been talking about banging heads in the New World Order all day.
[03:09:04.428 --> 03:09:05.609]  Why not just play this song?
[03:09:07.391 --> 03:09:09.473]  Not about to see Lucifer's light!
[03:09:12.839 --> 03:09:15.620]  Alright, I want to go to Anthony Gucciardi who's going to be hosting the show in a moment.
[03:09:15.660 --> 03:09:23.763]  As you continue with your calls, Melvin, Jason, Frank, Ivy, Chris and others that are patiently holding the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[03:09:24.623 --> 03:09:26.624]  Again, the woods are lovely, dark and deep.
[03:09:26.764 --> 03:09:30.025]  This election is amazing, but I've got miles to go before I sleep.
[03:09:30.685 --> 03:09:33.446]  I've got to, I'm going to follow a bunch of special reports right now.
[03:09:34.306 --> 03:09:38.868]  I'm going to get in there and shoot some videos promoting the most important ad of the campaign season.
[03:09:38.888 --> 03:09:40.329]  Just an ad trying to stop World War III.
[03:09:40.349 --> 03:09:41.129]  It's not even political.
[03:09:41.609 --> 03:09:43.690]  It's going viral right now on InfoWars.com.
[03:09:44.871 --> 03:09:50.893]  And the title of the video is, this viral video has Hillary running scared.
[03:09:51.934 --> 03:09:55.755]  So that's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[03:09:56.556 --> 03:09:59.597]  And I really want to ask folks to get that video and send it to everybody you know.
[03:10:00.799 --> 03:10:08.945]  I'd like to have 20 million views between our Facebook channel and our YouTube channel.
[03:10:09.025 --> 03:10:12.108]  It's got like a million, two hundred thousand last time I checked an hour ago.
[03:10:12.268 --> 03:10:12.688]  That's great.
[03:10:13.329 --> 03:10:15.450]  We should do something like post it to Paul's Facebook too.
[03:10:15.490 --> 03:10:17.552]  He gets a lot, like three or four million views on a lot of those videos.
[03:10:18.072 --> 03:10:22.055]  So we should do it like on different... People say, yes, we are posting the link to the YouTube on Facebook.
[03:10:22.075 --> 03:10:22.276]  No, no.
[03:10:22.816 --> 03:10:24.537]  Post it on Facebook video.
[03:10:25.178 --> 03:10:27.500]  See, I'm not here hiding proprietary secrets.
[03:10:27.540 --> 03:10:29.021]  I want people to win the fight against globalists.
[03:10:29.541 --> 03:10:30.182]  Mainstream media
[03:10:31.135 --> 03:10:36.719]  We'll do something like post a video one place, find out what has the biggest monetization on it, because I can care less about making money on this.
[03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:37.640]  It's negligible.
[03:10:37.660 --> 03:10:39.121]  It's about stopping World War III.
[03:10:39.662 --> 03:10:41.904]  And then they'll just obsess over one video they promote the most.
[03:10:42.444 --> 03:10:46.647]  I've found it's best to put it on a bunch of platforms, and then it only makes it bigger.
[03:10:47.968 --> 03:10:55.214]  And so this video needs to go on Paul's Facebook, not just my Facebook, and not just his YouTube and my YouTube.
[03:10:55.274 --> 03:10:56.195]  We need it everywhere.
[03:10:56.215 --> 03:10:57.736]  We need it on every channel we've got.
[03:10:57.756 --> 03:10:59.458]  We need to copy it to your channel.
[03:11:00.964 --> 03:11:05.508]  You need to get it out to everybody because that's the whole list of subscribers you've got that are going to be seeing this.
[03:11:05.568 --> 03:11:08.070]  And every little bit really has a giant effect.
[03:11:08.110 --> 03:11:08.851]  I mean, I wish.
[03:11:08.871 --> 03:11:12.614]  He's probably put out a version that doesn't have InfoWars on it.
[03:11:13.354 --> 03:11:15.436]  So maybe other talk show hosts would use it and then play it.
[03:11:15.516 --> 03:11:17.057]  I just want to stop the globalist.
[03:11:17.718 --> 03:11:18.519]  That's the goal here.
[03:11:19.379 --> 03:11:23.022]  Now, I want to play a few minutes of Trump as he was about to give a speech just an hour ago.
[03:11:24.056 --> 03:11:24.356]  I don't know.
[03:11:37.376 --> 03:11:52.522]  Lord willing, because you never know what's going to happen with the way they're coming after free speech, but I've got to tell you, Anthony, we're going to skip this break so you have more time to play this clip and then come back and take calls, but we've been just talking during the breaks and stuff, because your office is right by the TV studio here in the office, larger office.
[03:11:53.722 --> 03:11:58.804]  We're not just hype-driven, I mean, as you know, people that just get excited over nothing.
[03:11:58.864 --> 03:12:04.686]  We can feel it, we can see it, everything Hillary is doing turns to crap, but
[03:12:05.782 --> 03:12:09.288]  We really should be concerned because they are going to pull out all the stops now.
[03:12:09.668 --> 03:12:18.423]  The problem is they've already pretty much pulled out all the stops propaganda-wise, and I don't even get off on it because it's so dangerous, but watching all these chicken-neck traders...
[03:12:19.241 --> 03:12:21.402]  It doesn't take much to look at the headlines and realize that
[03:12:45.675 --> 03:12:50.919]  The system, the so-called establishment, whatever you want to say, right, has lost its mind.
[03:12:51.279 --> 03:12:56.803]  It's gotten so brazen, but at the same time so weak, the news media corporations don't even care anymore.
[03:12:57.503 --> 03:13:02.827]  Some of these headlines we can just read off, and it sounds like it's so outlandish, it couldn't be true.
[03:13:03.467 --> 03:13:08.431]  They just kicked Russia off the UN Human Rights Council, but then they re-elected Saudi Arabia.
[03:13:09.031 --> 03:13:16.657]  Okay, Saudi Arabia where if females talk to men they're not related to, they get lashed or they could be dismembered, okay?
[03:13:17.297 --> 03:13:19.219]  Saudi Arabia where women can't drive.
[03:13:19.399 --> 03:13:28.086]  Saudi Arabia where women are basically treated like dogs and if you drink alcohol you could be sentenced to 50 lashes or you could be killed.
[03:13:28.866 --> 03:13:30.348]  But Russia's removed from the
[03:13:30.968 --> 03:13:31.849]  I mean, it's total cuckoo land.
[03:13:31.869 --> 03:13:32.970]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:13:32.990 --> 03:13:34.711]  What do you think of Bloomberg coming out and saying,
[03:13:47.091 --> 03:13:52.473]  Yeah, all these cities let illegals vote, and states are passing laws, but Trump's insane it doesn't exist.
[03:13:53.013 --> 03:13:57.155]  Actual articles in the first two paragraphs contradicting themselves.
[03:13:57.675 --> 03:13:59.056]  Well, you know what the best response is?
[03:13:59.416 --> 03:14:08.820]  When you're beaten in an argument, instead of using logic or reason, which is not how this country operates anymore, never, never, never, you just say, that's not the case at all.
[03:14:09.060 --> 03:14:09.780]  That's not the case at all.
[03:14:09.820 --> 03:14:14.582]  Just like Obama says, election rigging, elections are totally flawless, there's nothing wrong
[03:14:15.422 --> 03:14:20.224]  Well, anything can be anything when you say it like that, right?
[03:14:20.544 --> 03:14:24.626]  So you could even say like, wow, it seems like maybe Obamacare doesn't work.
[03:14:25.086 --> 03:14:25.627]  Works great!
[03:14:27.047 --> 03:14:30.369]  It's the ultimate answer to anything when you actually can't respond to something.
[03:14:30.689 --> 03:14:38.292]  You just say the biggest lie ever, and then what happens is there's like a margin where people fall in, where if you say, for example, I'm a huge pink elephant.
[03:14:39.581 --> 03:14:41.462]  But someone else says, that guy's not a pink elephant.
[03:14:41.883 --> 03:14:45.946]  The truth, people just mentally, psychologically say, well, it's somewhere in the middle, right?
[03:14:46.306 --> 03:14:49.288]  Yeah, I'll talk about that British psychological warfare manual I read years ago.
[03:14:49.328 --> 03:14:56.693]  It said that, like, if we've killed 4,000 people in a village, we just announced 10 were killed, and once the real number comes out, people will average it down.
[03:14:57.173 --> 03:15:02.217]  Yeah, they just say, well, no one's so crazy they'd lie so deeply about something.
[03:15:02.477 --> 03:15:03.838]  So it must be half true.
[03:15:04.019 --> 03:15:05.580]  You're kind of looking like a pink elephant all of a sudden.
[03:15:05.600 --> 03:15:06.561]  I am a pink elephant, actually.
[03:15:06.621 --> 03:15:07.281]  No, that's 100% true.
[03:15:07.441 --> 03:15:09.403]  And if anyone disagrees with that, they're wrong.
[03:15:09.543 --> 03:15:09.983]  They're racists.
[03:15:10.183 --> 03:15:13.626]  They're racists against pink elephants because that's how I identify and that's how I feel.
[03:15:14.267 --> 03:15:18.090]  And if you're going to disagree with me, I'm just going to say, no, I am a pink fluffy elephant.
[03:15:18.190 --> 03:15:20.091]  And in fact, when you touch me, it feels like clouds.
[03:15:20.512 --> 03:15:21.212]  And that's real life.
[03:15:21.312 --> 03:15:21.813]  That's all true.
[03:15:22.910 --> 03:15:24.131]  And Hillary's a beautiful woman.
[03:15:24.251 --> 03:15:24.851]  She is beautiful.
[03:15:24.911 --> 03:15:26.351]  She's Miss America and Miss Universe.
[03:15:27.192 --> 03:15:27.892]  We were saying that.
[03:15:29.052 --> 03:15:32.254]  We were like North Koreans saying, she makes the sun shine, the clouds.
[03:15:32.514 --> 03:15:34.254]  I mean, they're only a few steps away from that.
[03:15:35.295 --> 03:15:37.836]  Maybe she's the big pink elephant that feels like clouds.
[03:15:39.416 --> 03:15:40.337]  I don't know.
[03:15:40.797 --> 03:15:45.879]  I am worried though, because there's this new tactic where they've got articles about me every day that just literally have quotes I never said.
[03:15:48.480 --> 03:15:49.740]  Well, that's one way to do it, right?
[03:15:50.140 --> 03:15:51.181]  Or the best is also,
[03:15:51.761 --> 03:16:03.584]  When they take something to attack someone, or they'll take something to attack you or something, and they'll mix it up and stuff, and it's like, it's obviously mixed up, it's, it's, you're being funny, like it's humorous, like you get it, you're in on the joke.
[03:16:03.765 --> 03:16:06.305]  It's not even Trump charging into a goblin's nest?
[03:16:06.385 --> 03:16:07.266]  Kissing goblins?
[03:16:07.706 --> 03:16:08.486]  Goblins vomit?
[03:16:09.326 --> 03:16:11.908]  That video has 8 million views.
[03:16:12.328 --> 03:16:12.989]  I think it's great.
[03:16:13.069 --> 03:16:13.829]  I love that video.
[03:16:14.049 --> 03:16:16.891]  I think that is... Yeah, well the trolls love it because we don't mind being made fun of.
[03:16:16.911 --> 03:16:17.492]  We think it's funny.
[03:16:17.632 --> 03:16:18.912]  You laugh at it.
[03:16:19.173 --> 03:16:21.354]  Look at him crazily talking about goblins.
[03:16:21.614 --> 03:16:24.276]  It's a 20 minute rant edited down to 10 seconds.
[03:16:25.815 --> 03:16:27.757]  As if you're sitting here talking about goblins.
[03:16:28.077 --> 03:16:30.899]  But the best is, no, everyone already knows what you're talking about.
[03:16:30.919 --> 03:16:31.499]  They're listening.
[03:16:31.540 --> 03:16:32.420]  They're listening right now.
[03:16:32.540 --> 03:16:33.621]  They're on the websites, right?
[03:16:33.881 --> 03:16:37.744]  So it's not like, they always act like, oh, he's some internet guy that no one knows about.
[03:16:37.784 --> 03:16:39.125]  Look, he's talking about goblins!
[03:16:39.525 --> 03:16:41.447]  Like, no, people already know what you're talking about.
[03:16:41.487 --> 03:16:42.067]  They're listening.
[03:16:42.608 --> 03:16:43.208]  That's the whole point.
[03:16:43.248 --> 03:16:45.530]  I was likening Hillary and the people as goblins.
[03:16:45.910 --> 03:16:51.755]  And I was thinking, if he has to hire a few politicos to get in, as long as he isn't, you know, charging in the goblin's nest,
[03:16:53.019 --> 03:16:56.443]  Kissing goblins, goblins vomit, catch him in bed with a goblin.
[03:16:56.584 --> 03:17:00.008]  You know, as long as he doesn't end up getting in bed with goblins, don't we get the metaphor?
[03:17:00.428 --> 03:17:01.049]  I totally get it.
[03:17:01.109 --> 03:17:01.529]  I love it.
[03:17:01.730 --> 03:17:03.732]  I say charge into a goblin's nest all day long.
[03:17:03.932 --> 03:17:06.515]  They say goblins are actually the funnest, you know, when the light's off, so.
[03:17:06.736 --> 03:17:07.837]  I can only imagine.
[03:17:08.618 --> 03:17:12.783]  And once again, not only am I Pink Elephant, I have personal experience in that realm as well, and no one can debate that.
[03:17:13.834 --> 03:17:15.597]  Well, you identify as a goblin.
[03:17:15.717 --> 03:17:15.957]  I do.
[03:17:15.977 --> 03:17:17.179]  A pink elephant slash goblin.
[03:17:17.219 --> 03:17:17.980]  Whatever I choose.
[03:17:18.461 --> 03:17:19.302]  Depends on my mood.
[03:17:19.863 --> 03:17:20.364]  And you know what?
[03:17:20.584 --> 03:17:22.908]  I think we should put in bathrooms for elephants.
[03:17:23.529 --> 03:17:24.831]  If somebody identifies as an elephant.
[03:17:25.575 --> 03:17:25.675]  They
[03:17:44.121 --> 03:17:44.662]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:17:58.951 --> 03:18:00.092]  You know what else is funny, too?
[03:18:00.572 --> 03:18:01.652]  So you think, oh, this is weird.
[03:18:02.152 --> 03:18:06.614]  That Biden video you did that I want to play at some point today in this hour?
[03:18:06.654 --> 03:18:06.874]  Oh, yeah.
[03:18:06.915 --> 03:18:08.555]  He's talking about once the beat up Trump.
[03:18:08.595 --> 03:18:12.617]  Talks about how dare he talk about women like that.
[03:18:12.637 --> 03:18:14.698]  I want to bring him behind the gym and beat him up.
[03:18:14.798 --> 03:18:22.581]  And then it's all just videos just from one little thing, one little event of him just acting so creepy and weird with these little girls.
[03:18:22.721 --> 03:18:26.363]  And then asking 12 year old girls out on dates and the mothers are actually like pushing him away.
[03:18:26.403 --> 03:18:27.924]  Look at him smelling their hair, though.
[03:18:28.792 --> 03:18:30.653]  It's so bizarre, it's so weird.
[03:18:30.673 --> 03:18:34.316]  Yeah, I mean, if your girlfriend wasn't in a good mood, she wouldn't like you doing this to her.
[03:18:34.336 --> 03:18:36.517]  This is like literal sexual advances.
[03:18:36.777 --> 03:18:38.178]  The problem is, there's hours of them.
[03:18:38.699 --> 03:18:41.501]  All he does is just grab, he sees a little girl, he runs at them.
[03:18:41.781 --> 03:18:55.490]  And he goes, he's like smelling her hair, and then he goes in for a kiss, like he's contemplating the kiss, he's like smelling the hair, and then you can tell him, you can see when he makes a decision, he goes in to kiss, and then the girl's like... And he says to the mother, I'd like to take your daughter.
[03:18:55.690 --> 03:18:57.872]  And he's like, let me get one with her alone.
[03:18:58.732 --> 03:19:03.657]  They're all like, ooh, she's like eight years old, ten years old, I don't know how old she is.
[03:19:03.737 --> 03:19:04.698]  Oh, this is so creepy.
[03:19:05.159 --> 03:19:05.779]  Super weird.
[03:19:05.819 --> 03:19:08.121]  If some guy was doing that to my daughter, I'd punch him right in the nose.
[03:19:08.522 --> 03:19:09.703]  Well, he's gonna beat up Trump, so.
[03:19:10.564 --> 03:19:11.185]  Oh yeah, right.
[03:19:12.306 --> 03:19:13.687]  I'm so sick of these wannabe gangsters.
[03:19:14.087 --> 03:19:19.753]  I guarantee you, that guy, man, getting in a boxing ring with him, I mean, when he was young, whatever, it'd be a joke.
[03:19:20.834 --> 03:19:21.795]  What a piece of crap.
[03:19:22.116 --> 03:19:27.022]  I still think we should do a boxing event with you and another contender.
[03:19:27.443 --> 03:19:28.464]  All money goes to charity.
[03:19:28.905 --> 03:19:30.227]  I think people would love to watch that.
[03:19:30.247 --> 03:19:31.108]  Get my ass kicked probably.
[03:19:31.348 --> 03:19:31.889]  No, I don't know.
[03:19:31.949 --> 03:19:33.110]  I'm gonna trade punches with Weldon.
[03:19:33.871 --> 03:19:35.113]  I'm old now, I can't do it.
[03:19:36.014 --> 03:19:37.997]  Anyways, alright, we're going to skip this break.
[03:19:38.017 --> 03:19:39.138]  I want to play this Trump clip.
[03:19:39.158 --> 03:19:40.279]  You take over, and I'll give that other one.
[03:19:40.319 --> 03:19:42.142]  I mean, that's the thing about Biden.
[03:19:42.342 --> 03:19:43.864]  Biden caught groping little girls.
[03:19:43.904 --> 03:19:44.825]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[03:19:45.085 --> 03:19:54.196]  The White House has all these top rappers singing songs at the White House about raping women, and then Michelle's all cracking voice, Trump, the tapes!
[03:19:54.376 --> 03:19:55.017]  I'm scared!
[03:19:55.097 --> 03:19:55.638]  I'm scared!
[03:19:56.411 --> 03:19:57.152]  It's non-logic.
[03:19:57.192 --> 03:19:58.473]  Remember I played that one song for you?
[03:19:58.733 --> 03:20:01.395]  It's literally, like, about date raping girls and stuff.
[03:20:01.595 --> 03:20:02.356]  And here's the thing, though.
[03:20:02.736 --> 03:20:08.260]  We're not, like, they make such a big deal as, oh, everything is so horrible, it must be politically correct, blah, blah.
[03:20:08.280 --> 03:20:10.082]  And then they invite these people to the White House.
[03:20:10.362 --> 03:20:11.003]  It's a big joke.
[03:20:11.063 --> 03:20:14.065]  I want to know, who wants a woman passed out when they're having sex with them?
[03:20:14.085 --> 03:20:15.646]  It's kind of like these Muslims that want 40 virgins.
[03:20:16.869 --> 03:20:18.009]  Sounds like a frickin' nightmare.
[03:20:18.729 --> 03:20:28.731]  I mean, who wants, who wants, well it does show these arrests of development, these guys like, I get the champagne, put the molly in, they don't know what I did, do what I did the next day, you know, it's like, bitch slap, ho, boom!
[03:20:28.751 --> 03:20:30.571]  They're like, oh you're so liberal, ah!
[03:20:30.771 --> 03:20:38.433]  But look, it's one thing, if those rappers wanna rap about that, and like, rap about killing cops or whatever, great, they can do, like, cool, that's your thing.
[03:20:38.453 --> 03:20:42.033]  Yeah, there's people running around going, you're so upset about Trump, which they have, rappers do.
[03:20:42.073 --> 03:20:43.494]  You can't have it both ways.
[03:20:43.634 --> 03:20:44.554]  If you're gonna listen, like,
[03:20:45.114 --> 03:20:47.515]  I'll listen to some so-called, you know, lewd music, whatever.
[03:20:47.776 --> 03:20:51.758]  I'm not going to listen to that music, though, and then say, oh my God, did you say a curse word?
[03:20:52.058 --> 03:20:52.879]  How dare you?
[03:20:52.959 --> 03:21:03.065]  It's the weird, illogical, like, unreasonable thing where they praise it and invite those people to the White House, but then act like they're going to cry when they heard something.
[03:21:03.185 --> 03:21:06.227]  Michelle Obama with the fake cracking of the voice, I can't sleep.
[03:21:06.747 --> 03:21:07.447]  I'm scared.
[03:21:11.090 --> 03:21:24.271]  Meanwhile, both their daughters are there with the big fat goblin, speaking of a real goblin, talking about a goblin nest, Rick Ross shaking their asses at the White House with him going, I rate bitches down with the hoes!
[03:21:26.625 --> 03:21:27.765]  Michelle's shaking her ass.
[03:21:27.845 --> 03:21:29.626]  It's like a comedy special.
[03:21:29.706 --> 03:21:32.147]  It's not even that we're being funny, it's just funny.
[03:21:32.247 --> 03:21:32.787]  You know what I mean?
[03:21:32.807 --> 03:21:34.427]  Like, it's not real life.
[03:21:34.487 --> 03:21:35.927]  It's so weird and fake.
[03:21:36.228 --> 03:21:38.088]  And then people act like they're so upset.
[03:21:38.128 --> 03:21:41.109]  Like, Michelle was, she was crying at the idea.
[03:21:41.129 --> 03:21:42.829]  No, Glenn Beck said it was the most powerful speech ever.
[03:21:43.249 --> 03:21:44.110]  See, I told you.
[03:21:44.710 --> 03:21:47.811]  Now I'm going to go on NPR right now and be the apologist for conservatism.
[03:21:47.851 --> 03:21:49.131]  I guess it is time to turn the guns in.
[03:21:50.020 --> 03:21:53.061]  She was heartbroken at the mistreatment.
[03:21:53.241 --> 03:21:57.582]  They had no idea that people spoke like that, that they talked about women in that way.
[03:21:58.522 --> 03:22:08.045]  As the song is about date raping women, giving them ecstasy so that they don't know they're having sex and they're knocked out in their alcohol, and then, like, orgasming in them.
[03:22:08.205 --> 03:22:08.945]  It's like, oh!
[03:22:10.425 --> 03:22:11.906]  Have you heard Beyonce?
[03:22:11.926 --> 03:22:12.686]  She's so wonderful.
[03:22:13.286 --> 03:22:17.428]  And it's all the same stuff, 50 times worse than Trump.
[03:22:17.808 --> 03:22:21.529]  And then Trump's recorded, secretly edited, and make a big deal out of it.
[03:22:22.369 --> 03:22:24.970]  And they go, he's put this on TV for girls to hear.
[03:22:26.334 --> 03:22:28.175]  They're the ones putting it on TV.
[03:22:29.156 --> 03:22:29.576]  Exactly.
[03:22:29.616 --> 03:22:32.198]  And they're the ones pushing that stuff in the White House.
[03:22:32.338 --> 03:22:34.919]  I don't care if there's rappers that want to rap about that stuff.
[03:22:34.939 --> 03:22:35.220]  Great.
[03:22:35.260 --> 03:22:38.302]  We're not going to sit here and be like, how dare they say these things?
[03:22:38.322 --> 03:22:39.342]  I mean, this is real life, right?
[03:22:39.803 --> 03:22:45.926]  But to propose that they're amazing, but anyone else they disagree with that says anything, oh, they're going to cry.
[03:22:46.347 --> 03:22:47.287]  So fake, so scripted.
[03:22:47.307 --> 03:22:47.968]  It's like a play.
[03:22:48.028 --> 03:22:49.469]  It's like an elementary school play.
[03:22:50.069 --> 03:22:55.734]  Well, we've got the videos of Biden perving out, so I'm going to let you get to that, get to these other calls coming up.
[03:22:55.774 --> 03:23:01.940]  But right now, here is Trump as he learned, right as he gave a speech, the FBI has reopened the investigation, which just shows that
[03:23:13.630 --> 03:23:14.870]  The public knows what's happening.
[03:23:14.890 --> 03:23:15.991]  They can't get away with it.
[03:23:16.011 --> 03:23:17.971]  The new smoking gun evidence has come out in the WikiLeaks.
[03:23:18.391 --> 03:23:19.492]  And this is huge.
[03:23:20.232 --> 03:23:21.472]  To quote Trump, here it is.
[03:23:23.313 --> 03:23:36.237]  I need to open with a very critical breaking news announcement.
[03:23:36.257 --> 03:23:36.797]  The FBI
[03:23:41.647 --> 03:24:00.604]  Has just sent a letter to Congress informing them that they have discovered new emails pertaining to the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's investigation.
[03:24:20.706 --> 03:24:32.075]  And they are reopening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America.
[03:24:32.095 --> 03:24:39.621]  Anybody thinks this movement's going away?
[03:24:42.523 --> 03:24:50.249]  Hillary Clinton's corruption is on a scale we have never seen before.
[03:24:53.157 --> 03:24:59.340]  We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.
[03:25:02.741 --> 03:25:17.708]  I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made.
[03:25:17.728 --> 03:25:21.290]  Makes me wonder what led them to do that.
[03:25:26.223 --> 03:25:32.946]  This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood.
[03:25:34.607 --> 03:25:41.150]  And it is everybody's hope that it is about to be corrected.
[03:25:52.176 --> 03:25:55.618]  So that is a big announcement that I heard ten minutes ago.
[03:25:57.623 --> 03:26:00.544]  And I guess, obviously, most of you folks have heard about.
[03:26:01.724 --> 03:26:20.089]  And in all fairness, for all of the people that have suffered for doing so much less, including just recently four-star General James Cartwright, General Petraeus, and many others, perhaps finally justice will be done.
[03:26:21.049 --> 03:26:34.675]  I don't think anyone's mentioned, earlier Alex broke this, that Twitter of the individual that was apologetic and saying Hillary did nothing wrong, there was no emails that were bad in any way, who I guess worked for her, he deleted all his tweets.
[03:26:34.715 --> 03:26:38.177]  The rest of my speech is going to be so boring.
[03:26:41.479 --> 03:26:43.199]  Should I even make this speech?
[03:26:45.841 --> 03:26:48.502]  We will talk about borders, right?
[03:26:49.813 --> 03:26:51.274]  We will talk about trade.
[03:26:52.935 --> 03:26:54.476]  We'll bring back our jobs.
[03:26:54.516 --> 03:26:56.197]  We'll strengthen our military.
[03:26:57.057 --> 03:26:58.638]  And let's get going, okay?
[03:27:06.243 --> 03:27:07.564]  That's the great golden toad.
[03:27:07.704 --> 03:27:11.606]  General Flynn is a great general and I want to thank you for being here.
[03:27:14.068 --> 03:27:15.008]  He didn't try to cover that up.
[03:27:15.028 --> 03:27:15.688]  Didn't work, did it?
[03:27:15.928 --> 03:27:17.089]  Because you people are idiots.
[03:27:17.189 --> 03:27:20.029]  When General Flynn was going up, we heard this news.
[03:27:20.109 --> 03:27:22.849]  I said, General, get up there and keep them busy.
[03:27:22.949 --> 03:27:26.010]  We want to digest what just happened here.
[03:27:26.510 --> 03:27:27.290]  Thank you, General.
[03:27:29.891 --> 03:27:32.491]  In 11 days, we are going to win New Hampshire.
[03:27:33.251 --> 03:27:40.572]  By the way, when they fired him for exposing it two years ago, how much they hate the fact that Flynn basically runs the campaign.
[03:27:40.592 --> 03:27:43.293]  The foreign head of defense intelligence.
[03:27:44.218 --> 03:27:44.958]  Basically the army.
[03:27:46.459 --> 03:27:54.743]  I mean, Anthony, it's just, it's so good to see finally America's instincts kick back in and these criminals that have hijacked the nation are crapping their pants.
[03:27:54.763 --> 03:27:58.425]  When you see Hillary climb up in the plane today, she looked like a rat going on board.
[03:27:58.445 --> 03:28:01.307]  I mean, she was just stumbling around, looked like she was half dead.
[03:28:01.367 --> 03:28:03.588]  I mean, the weakness of this demon.
[03:28:04.824 --> 03:28:06.785]  The boiling point has been reached 100%.
[03:28:07.305 --> 03:28:09.005]  Listen to how mad those people are in the audience.
[03:28:09.405 --> 03:28:11.546]  That is how everyone feels in this entire country.
[03:28:11.966 --> 03:28:18.148]  Whether or not you even want to ascribe it to individual candidates or whatever, this has been happening for a long, long, long time.
[03:28:18.188 --> 03:28:18.928]  Hillary's out to get us!
[03:28:19.028 --> 03:28:20.109]  She's a piece of filth!
[03:28:20.489 --> 03:28:22.189]  The system, the establishment, whatever.
[03:28:22.209 --> 03:28:25.070]  She hates America and prosperity and guns and everybody.
[03:28:25.310 --> 03:28:26.331]  She hates black people.
[03:28:26.371 --> 03:28:27.131]  She hates Hispanics.
[03:28:27.151 --> 03:28:27.751]  She hates whites.
[03:28:27.971 --> 03:28:28.791]  She hates poor people.
[03:28:29.032 --> 03:28:30.112]  She's a piece of filth!
[03:28:31.451 --> 03:28:39.115]  We all bought into the lie at one point in our life, and now as a collective though, the country is literally saying, oh my god, it's been a lie the entire time.
[03:28:39.135 --> 03:28:41.397]  And I'll tell you, I'm not bragging, but I'm not proud.
[03:28:41.417 --> 03:28:50.462]  I have a feeling of intense satisfaction, of not completion, but if they got me now, you know, I feel like I've fulfilled my true mission.
[03:28:51.302 --> 03:29:00.190]  Because I know, and the enemy knows, and they admit it, our resistance, what we've done, breaking down the enemy's operations, is at the heart of every core resistance operation now.
[03:29:00.490 --> 03:29:04.833]  And to see it duplicating now, it's just, it's fantastical, Anthony.
[03:29:05.234 --> 03:29:08.917]  I mean, I don't care about big buildings or money or jet airplanes.
[03:29:09.437 --> 03:29:12.740]  I really care about stomping these globalists, and God is delivering.
[03:29:13.507 --> 03:29:34.517]  It's kind of like in Medieval Siege when you've got the castle and the castle's being defended and that's the system and you have the battering rams and somebody's got to push the battering rams and they get shot by the archers and the arrows are flying everywhere and stabbing, hitting people and there's blood everywhere and they're dying but somebody's still got to push the battering ram up to the gates because if those gates don't get open then something's going to work.
[03:29:34.537 --> 03:29:37.779]  Exactly, the Trinity's keep thinking I'm getting beaten because I'm full of arrows.
[03:29:38.099 --> 03:29:39.700]  They don't get, I know what I'm doing.
[03:29:39.780 --> 03:29:41.220]  You're bashing down the gate, man.
[03:29:41.240 --> 03:29:42.621]  We're ramming this son of a bitch down
[03:29:42.921 --> 03:29:45.323]  And I'm telling you, those doors are falling right now.
[03:29:45.384 --> 03:29:46.284]  They're on fire.
[03:29:46.685 --> 03:29:48.366]  The enemy is beginning to turn and run.
[03:29:49.047 --> 03:29:51.049]  Let's just hope they don't fell forward and launch a big war.
[03:29:51.109 --> 03:29:52.390]  Anthony, take over on the other side.
[03:29:52.891 --> 03:29:56.474]  We'll show incredible footage of the pervert vice president.
[03:29:56.875 --> 03:29:58.156]  How dare him attack Trump.
[03:29:58.176 --> 03:29:59.377]  He is a pervert filth.
[03:30:00.178 --> 03:30:01.079]  We're on the march.
[03:30:01.559 --> 03:30:03.161]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:04.102 --> 03:30:06.785]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:19.272 --> 03:30:23.477]  A CBS Chicago investigation finds dead people voting in Chicago.
[03:30:23.738 --> 03:30:28.243]  Susie Sally died in 1998, but voted in Chicago 12 years later.
[03:30:28.444 --> 03:30:30.166]  Victor Croswalk died in 1994.
[03:30:31.087 --> 03:30:32.549]  He's voted six times since.
[03:30:32.829 --> 03:30:38.196]  Floyd Stevens passed in 1993, but records have him showing up to the polls 11 times since then.
[03:30:38.436 --> 03:30:49.580]  Earl Smith, Tedesco Siesla are also amongst the 119 deceased voters that have cast ballots a total of 229 times in Chicago over the last decade.
[03:30:49.800 --> 03:30:50.980]  May they rest in peace.
[03:30:51.400 --> 03:30:56.002]  Jim Allen, a city election board spokesperson said, this isn't the bad old days.
[03:30:56.302 --> 03:31:00.403]  No, I guess it's the good new days where you can get away with election fraud.
[03:31:00.663 --> 03:31:05.625]  So CBS has now reported finding dead voters in Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles.
[03:31:05.905 --> 03:31:06.486]  Where next?
[03:31:06.666 --> 03:31:08.628]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[03:31:26.448 --> 03:31:31.370]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[03:31:31.490 --> 03:31:34.011]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[03:31:34.071 --> 03:31:35.572]  It helps detoxify.
[03:31:35.772 --> 03:31:38.613]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[03:31:38.673 --> 03:31:43.415]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[03:31:43.435 --> 03:31:49.678]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[03:31:49.718 --> 03:31:55.021]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[03:31:55.041 --> 03:31:55.781]  I'm taking it now.
[03:31:56.021 --> 03:31:56.542]  Every day.
[03:31:56.742 --> 03:31:57.463]  This is so key.
[03:31:57.724 --> 03:32:00.047]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[03:32:00.287 --> 03:32:02.010]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[03:32:02.050 --> 03:32:04.173]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.

[03:32:15.562 --> 03:32:17.765]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:32:17.885 --> 03:32:24.691]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[03:32:24.911 --> 03:32:28.195]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[03:32:28.215 --> 03:32:29.376]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[03:32:29.676 --> 03:32:31.518]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[03:32:31.838 --> 03:32:36.064]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[03:32:36.304 --> 03:32:37.225]  This is sustainable.
[03:32:37.245 --> 03:32:41.230]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[03:32:41.431 --> 03:32:44.615]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[03:32:44.675 --> 03:32:47.679]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[03:32:47.739 --> 03:32:49.220]  We're looking at the television screen.
[03:32:49.260 --> 03:32:54.962]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:32:54.982 --> 03:33:00.143]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com.
[03:33:00.363 --> 03:33:00.964]  Or call 888-253-3139.

[03:33:03.665 --> 03:33:04.865]  And we thank you for your support.
[03:33:15.247 --> 03:33:29.877]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe Lost my wife and a girlfriend Somewhere along the way I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate
[03:33:33.140 --> 03:33:40.085]  Seems like the FBI, now that I think about it, actually always waits till Friday to announce things to do with Hillary Clinton's emails.
[03:33:40.966 --> 03:33:42.167]  Nonetheless, it's still a big story.
[03:33:42.187 --> 03:33:49.533]  We're going to talk about a lot of stuff before the closing of the final fourth hour today on this Friday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:49.633 --> 03:33:53.456]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi, honored to be invited to host the program.
[03:33:54.016 --> 03:34:00.038]  We're talking about how the UN Human Rights Council voted out Russia, but re-elected Saudi Arabia.
[03:34:00.479 --> 03:34:06.281]  Where, again, if you're a woman and you talk to a man you're not related to, you could get your arms cut off and get lashed.
[03:34:06.661 --> 03:34:09.822]  If you drink alcohol, you could get lashed as well.
[03:34:10.743 --> 03:34:18.846]  If you drive a car as a female, except for certain areas, like certain provinces and stuff, that is almost a fatal sentence.
[03:34:19.426 --> 03:34:21.827]  But the Human Rights Council, they're good.
[03:34:22.548 --> 03:34:23.868]  Saudi Arabia gets to be re-elected.
[03:34:24.049 --> 03:34:24.549]  Russia's out.
[03:34:24.689 --> 03:34:27.230]  Not that Russia's amazing or anything, but Saudi Arabia, right?
[03:34:27.971 --> 03:34:29.932]  Of course, because there's funding there and things like that.
[03:34:30.652 --> 03:34:33.614]  We're also going to play this Biden video shortly here.
[03:34:33.634 --> 03:34:35.375]  This weird, creepy Biden video.
[03:34:36.375 --> 03:34:46.505]  And the truth is that it's not even about, like, look, Trump and his people are very smart because they see the fact that the boiling point has been reached and people are pissed off, right?
[03:34:46.965 --> 03:34:52.751]  Now, Biden can go and act all weird and creepy with literally little girls, like, sniffing their hair and stuff.
[03:34:52.791 --> 03:34:53.511]  It's just weird.
[03:34:53.912 --> 03:34:55.894]  And I guess no one's concerned about that.
[03:34:56.494 --> 03:35:08.928]  Because what happens is when you're on the side of the political correctness system and you're on the side of like always acting like you're upset by everything and just playing, it's a fake act, then you can kind of get away with more things, right?
[03:35:09.189 --> 03:35:10.770]  When you act so offended by everything.
[03:35:11.511 --> 03:35:15.373]  But the truth is, in real life, that doesn't matter, right?
[03:35:15.473 --> 03:35:22.575]  So it is still creepy when Biden is literally trying to kiss little girls and they're pushing away from him, and this is just at one event.
[03:35:22.595 --> 03:35:23.736]  So we're going to play that too.
[03:35:24.076 --> 03:35:33.800]  First I want to remind you, on InfoWarsLife.com, Brain Force, 25% off, it's ending this weekend, if we even have enough to go to Sunday.
[03:35:34.640 --> 03:35:37.522]  So, 25% off is a pretty unprecedented amount.
[03:35:37.562 --> 03:35:43.587]  I mean, it's been at least, what, several months, six months since it's been that rate, and of course it is selling out.
[03:35:43.907 --> 03:35:47.609]  So, BrainForce is, in my view, the best nootropic out there.
[03:35:48.689 --> 03:35:51.811]  It has prescription ingredients from Europe.
[03:35:52.071 --> 03:35:55.013]  As in, in Europe, they are designated as prescription.
[03:35:55.273 --> 03:35:55.853]  They're not here.
[03:35:55.893 --> 03:35:57.854]  You can get them in the Brain Force formula.
[03:35:58.675 --> 03:36:00.036]  And it really, really works.
[03:36:00.136 --> 03:36:02.057]  And what I mean by that is it's clean.
[03:36:02.177 --> 03:36:04.859]  As in, if I take two Brain Force, I feel more alert.
[03:36:04.999 --> 03:36:07.340]  I feel like I can speak more clearly.
[03:36:07.780 --> 03:36:12.663]  I feel like I'm more apt to want to go ahead and do things like, you know, host this show right now, right?
[03:36:13.123 --> 03:36:15.105]  So it really works for me and a bunch of people.
[03:36:15.845 --> 03:36:17.568]  Uh, throughout the world.
[03:36:17.648 --> 03:36:19.271]  There's thousands of reviews, five-star reviews.
[03:36:19.291 --> 03:36:20.894]  Check it out at Infowarslife.com.
[03:36:21.215 --> 03:36:22.757]  And also, storable food is 30 to 40% off.
[03:36:24.721 --> 03:36:27.864]  Who knows what's going to happen in the world, and it's always good to have some storable food.
[03:36:28.124 --> 03:36:31.948]  It lasts 25 years, so there's really no loss there.
[03:36:32.028 --> 03:36:32.769]  It's a great investment.
[03:36:32.809 --> 03:36:37.954]  And if it doesn't, if in 24 years you decide you don't need it, you can cook it and you can eat it.
[03:36:38.254 --> 03:36:41.237]  So it's just basically going to the grocery store except a long-term investment.
[03:36:41.277 --> 03:36:43.159]  That's all on Infowarslife.com.
[03:36:43.299 --> 03:36:43.719]  Check it out.
[03:36:44.220 --> 03:36:47.263]  Now, what I want to do is I want to go to this Biden video.
[03:36:47.503 --> 03:36:49.004]  Now, again,
[03:36:49.850 --> 03:36:54.992]  Again, this is one of those things where it's not even Trump vs. Hillary, it's just real life vs. completely insane.
[03:36:55.392 --> 03:36:58.634]  Just like the stories I've talked about today, with the headlines they are insane.
[03:36:59.934 --> 03:37:13.360]  The truth is that political correctness so-called, you know that thing we always talk about where, how dare someone said something about a female, how dare someone said something blah blah blah, people acting like they're upset.
[03:37:13.980 --> 03:37:22.712]  Using it as a form of domination, verbal domination, intellectual domination, thought control, as a way to kind of prop themselves up and make them feel like they're part of something, right?
[03:37:23.212 --> 03:37:30.682]  Well, Joe Biden goes and they do this whole act that they're so upset about what Trump said, which isn't good, by the way.
[03:37:31.742 --> 03:37:45.950]  Okay, not saying Trump is anything great, or that he's even that great, but I'm saying they act all like they're crying and stuff, yet they're bringing rappers to the White House who talk about dosing up girls with MDMA and presumably date raping them.
[03:37:46.870 --> 03:37:52.273]  And then Biden is like, I'm gonna go beat him up because of his statements on women.
[03:37:52.673 --> 03:37:55.795]  Then he does the creepiest stuff ever, and this is just only in one event.
[03:37:55.815 --> 03:37:56.495]  So let's play this video.
[03:37:58.959 --> 03:38:01.760]  If we've got a creepy Joe Biden has hit a new low.
[03:38:02.460 --> 03:38:12.184]  Coming out saying because Trump talked about women throwing themselves at him 11 years ago that he wants to take him behind the woodshed and basically beat him up.
[03:38:12.444 --> 03:38:15.425]  The press always asks me, don't I wish I were debating him?
[03:38:15.985 --> 03:38:17.105]  No, I wish you were in high school.
[03:38:17.125 --> 03:38:18.386]  I could take him behind the gym.
[03:38:26.252 --> 03:38:32.037]  If we showed you all the footage of Joe Biden groping women and children, it would take five hours.
[03:38:32.698 --> 03:38:39.344]  Just at one campaign event, he gropes eight different little girls, where mothers even kind of come over and get between them.
[03:38:40.124 --> 03:38:41.305]  He tells little girls
[03:38:42.267 --> 03:38:44.168]  But what he said, he did and does.
[03:39:09.181 --> 03:39:12.243]  Is a textbook definition of sexual assault.
[03:39:12.643 --> 03:39:15.124]  Think about this.
[03:39:15.144 --> 03:39:20.387]  But it's more than that.
[03:39:20.487 --> 03:39:24.009]  He said because I'm famous.
[03:39:24.029 --> 03:39:24.369]  Thank you.
[03:39:24.429 --> 03:39:26.030]  Because I'm a star.
[03:39:26.090 --> 03:39:26.670]  I can do things.
[03:39:40.094 --> 03:39:41.095]  Other people can't.
[03:39:41.135 --> 03:39:44.598]  What a disgusting assertion for anyone to make.
[03:39:54.158 --> 03:39:55.058]  Here's the bottom line.
[03:39:55.698 --> 03:40:01.900]  No one we've ever seen in politics has even been halfway as creepy as Joe Biden with women and children.
[03:40:02.601 --> 03:40:07.442]  Unless you're talking about creepy Tim Kaine, who takes it to an even higher level.
[03:40:07.762 --> 03:40:14.624]  Long before Tim Kaine was in office, he consistently protected the worst kinds of people.
[03:40:15.144 --> 03:40:21.927]  Lem Tuggle raped, sodomized, and murdered Jesse Geneva Havens after being paroled for murdering a 17-year-old girl.
[03:40:23.747 --> 03:40:25.749]  Tim Cain defended him.
[03:40:26.470 --> 03:40:30.635]  Richard Lee Whitley sexually assaulted and murdered his elderly neighbor.
[03:40:31.115 --> 03:40:32.957]  Tim Cain defended him.
[03:40:33.598 --> 03:40:39.444]  Outside Whitley's execution, Tim Cain said, Something personal in me will die with Whitley.
[03:40:40.325 --> 03:40:42.946]  Percy Walton brutally murdered three people.
[03:40:43.346 --> 03:40:48.789]  As governor, Tim Kaine commuted his sentence citing concerns disproved by the courts.
[03:40:49.409 --> 03:40:56.312]  Jens Soering and his girlfriend murdered Derek and Nancy Hasem, stabbing them to death in their home.
[03:40:57.092 --> 03:41:05.196]  On his last day as governor, Tim Kaine tried to have Soering sent to Germany, where parole would have been possible in just two years.
[03:41:13.761 --> 03:41:24.288]  And now we've got slimy, crooked Hillary slithering around at campaign events with only 10 days out from this big election with Michelle Obama squeezing and hugging on kids.
[03:41:24.428 --> 03:41:35.536]  And I actually have a pang of anxiety when I see this snake coming over to a child because I know how she's funded the most radical Islamists to sexually mutilate millions of young girls in Africa
[03:41:36.216 --> 03:41:51.872]  And in the Middle East, and how Uma Abedin, that she stays with in the same hotel room's mother, is the top Islamic scholar pushing mutilation of young women, having their genitals cut off, and how she backs ISIS and Al-Qaeda involved in all this persecution and murder of hundreds of thousands of Christians.
[03:41:52.292 --> 03:41:58.038]  It's just so crazy to realize what a group of freaks we're actually dealing with.
[03:41:58.478 --> 03:41:59.419]  But then it only gets worse.
[03:42:00.441 --> 03:42:13.949]  We've got at the White House famous rappers that talk about date rape in their lyrics and drugging women and raping them and who talk about cop killing at the White House with their children in these big concerts they put on.
[03:42:14.029 --> 03:42:16.491]  So publicly saying rape women is good.
[03:42:16.871 --> 03:42:20.293]  Trump jokes about women throwing themselves on him and how he could do whatever he wanted.
[03:42:20.613 --> 03:42:24.556]  That's the end of the world and horrible for children, but they're doing something a hundred times worse.
[03:42:25.615 --> 03:42:27.937]  I can do things other people can't.
[03:42:27.997 --> 03:42:28.777]  So you know what?
[03:42:28.817 --> 03:42:29.518]  Perfect example.
[03:42:48.152 --> 03:42:51.353]  It amazes me and concerns me that people don't seem to understand.
[03:42:51.373 --> 03:43:02.018]  The people that really, really think that all these individuals are just pure of heart and they're so upset by these comments that Trump made or so upset by whatever it is that they're claiming to be upset by.
[03:43:02.418 --> 03:43:05.199]  I mean, it's worse than House of Cards.
[03:43:05.899 --> 03:43:10.521]  If you've seen House of Cards, Frank Underwood, Kevin Spacey, one of the greatest actors of all time.
[03:43:11.061 --> 03:43:11.582]  Perfectly
[03:43:31.338 --> 03:43:32.720]  Do my hair this way, right?
[03:43:32.780 --> 03:43:41.010]  They're just 100% concerned about how I can weaponize something to use against the other candidate or use to get my support up or whatever.
[03:43:41.030 --> 03:43:46.176]  Does anyone really think that Biden was just so upset?
[03:43:46.877 --> 03:43:50.299]  Like he just was going to cry because he was so concerned by those statements.
[03:43:50.619 --> 03:44:02.246]  I mean, even at the most base level, unless you live under a rock, okay, let's say, let's pretend you are just like this pure of heart person that somehow managed to become the Vice President of the United States or President or whatever.
[03:44:02.766 --> 03:44:04.287]  Like you're such a pure hearted person.
[03:44:04.327 --> 03:44:05.928]  You never had to deal with any corruption.
[03:44:05.948 --> 03:44:06.989]  None of that existed.
[03:44:07.069 --> 03:44:10.631]  Like you never had to do anything to get to that point just because you're so pure.
[03:44:11.431 --> 03:44:16.974]  Even going to the movies, even reading the news, you should be aware of these things.
[03:44:17.014 --> 03:44:20.997]  You should be aware that people talk like this just existing on this planet.
[03:44:21.077 --> 03:44:29.482]  I've heard a bazillion worse things said just walking down the street, okay, to where I'm not going to get triggered by something like that.
[03:44:30.222 --> 03:44:30.662]  Is it good?
[03:44:30.742 --> 03:44:31.003]  No.
[03:44:31.143 --> 03:44:32.744]  Is it great that people say these things?
[03:44:32.804 --> 03:44:32.884]  No.
[03:44:34.021 --> 03:44:39.186]  I say horrible things sometimes too, as a joke or when I'm not really meaning it truly in my heart, right?
[03:44:40.006 --> 03:44:41.728]  People say crap all the time.
[03:44:42.348 --> 03:44:52.917]  So, these politicians, the most disturbing part, isn't even that they pretend all of this, it's that they get up there and weaponize things and people think it's real.
[03:44:53.738 --> 03:44:55.280]  It is totally crazy.
[03:44:55.360 --> 03:45:03.249]  It's just like, you know, we talk a lot about Russia and it's because of the fact that they're just, just everything is about Russia now.
[03:45:03.289 --> 03:45:06.012]  All the news is like Russia is going to do all these horrible things.
[03:45:06.721 --> 03:45:08.462]  Now, this is a great article.
[03:45:08.502 --> 03:45:15.848]  I was talking to Mikhail Thelin, who is a writer for Infowars.com, and we talked about this before it happened.
[03:45:16.409 --> 03:45:18.310]  In this article, NBC News, Payback?
[03:45:18.490 --> 03:45:20.932]  Russia Gets Hacked Revealing Putin-AIDS Secrets.
[03:45:21.673 --> 03:45:34.062]  A Ukrainian group calling itself CyberHunta has released more than a gigabyte of emails and other material from the office of one of Vladimir Putin's top aides that show Russia's fingerprints all over the separatist movement in Ukraine.
[03:45:36.187 --> 03:45:39.029]  I'm proud of NBC News for saying payback question mark.
[03:45:39.349 --> 03:45:44.072]  So the concept that Russia went in and did the DNC leaks, right?
[03:45:44.192 --> 03:45:45.193]  Who knows who it was, whatever.
[03:45:45.553 --> 03:45:53.478]  But the concept that the US is not going to retaliate or do some type of attack on Russia cyber warfare-wise is absurd.
[03:45:53.838 --> 03:45:55.779]  There's so much going on at all times.
[03:45:56.139 --> 03:45:58.041]  There's so much interplay that we don't know about.
[03:45:58.261 --> 03:46:02.123]  There's so much that it's basically sometimes it leaks out.
[03:46:02.163 --> 03:46:04.725]  Like sometimes we see the little tentacles of the octopus.
[03:46:05.405 --> 03:46:14.913]  And we are delusional if we think that 95% of the things that go on are not kind of like inside baseball interplay within the political systems.
[03:46:15.494 --> 03:46:16.815]  I mean, it's absurd.
[03:46:16.835 --> 03:46:29.006]  You can even watch like basic YouTube documentaries about donor parties and the politicians going to these people's houses, billionaires' houses, and they're like, well, we would never ask them to do anything for us.
[03:46:29.386 --> 03:46:31.807]  I just watched one of those on HBO the other night.
[03:46:32.107 --> 03:46:36.148]  The billionaire donors giving millions and millions of dollars to whoever candidate, right?
[03:46:36.468 --> 03:46:50.132]  And then saying, well, I just give it to them, like a really bad scripted speech, I just give them $5 million because I really just, and they like look away, all the indicators of lying, they're like, because I believe in them in my heart.
[03:46:50.152 --> 03:46:55.113]  And they're like, well, you would never gain anything from giving them $5 million?
[03:46:55.173 --> 03:46:57.314]  They wouldn't, you know, help you financially in any way?
[03:46:58.414 --> 03:46:59.435]  No way!
[03:46:59.475 --> 03:47:01.997]  You know, it's just so obvious.
[03:47:02.057 --> 03:47:03.718]  It's such a rigged system.
[03:47:03.758 --> 03:47:04.518]  It's a joke.
[03:47:04.698 --> 03:47:05.719]  It is pathetic.
[03:47:06.600 --> 03:47:10.062]  It is absurd to me that people believe it's real.
[03:47:10.642 --> 03:47:14.745]  Or, at the same time, they just say everything's good to fit in with those systems.
[03:47:15.265 --> 03:47:18.547]  I have friends that are business owners, very successful.
[03:47:18.567 --> 03:47:19.928]  I have friends from Silicon Valley.
[03:47:20.289 --> 03:47:24.892]  I have friends from multiple different angles, and they all see this for the truth.
[03:47:25.711 --> 03:47:31.715]  And there is growing movements beyond just the so-called awake, so-called people in the know, right?
[03:47:32.035 --> 03:47:38.299]  There's people that you wouldn't even ever suspect that get all of this, that see all of this, like I think most people do.
[03:47:38.660 --> 03:47:49.047]  But they're starting to get so upset by it, like they're starting to get so upset by the political correctness BS, or they're starting to get so upset seeing these headlines every day that are just so absurd.
[03:47:49.887 --> 03:47:55.571]  That even the Silicon Valley individuals, you would say they're so liberal or whatever.
[03:47:55.851 --> 03:48:03.837]  Let me just tell you, most of those people are just acting like they're okay with all the things going on because they don't want to screw up their financial ties.
[03:48:04.858 --> 03:48:10.882]  People like Peter Thiel represent a large percentage of Silicon Valley executives and individuals.
[03:48:11.463 --> 03:48:14.325]  Not necessarily that they even support Trump, but that they're just tired of all this.
[03:48:14.605 --> 03:48:14.805]  Right?
[03:48:15.125 --> 03:48:16.545]  They're just tired of all of it.
[03:48:17.086 --> 03:48:21.907]  And the big, big names that aren't saying anything are just afraid.
[03:48:22.087 --> 03:48:26.087]  Because if you go against the establishment system, of course you're going to get backlash, right?
[03:48:26.367 --> 03:48:28.308]  But that is the whole point of this fight.
[03:48:28.348 --> 03:48:32.309]  I mean, why even do anything if you're not going to do something with meaning, right?
[03:48:32.629 --> 03:48:38.010]  Why even take a stand for anything if you're not going to do what you truly believe?
[03:48:39.269 --> 03:48:41.911]  It is the epitome of going against your purpose.
[03:48:42.011 --> 03:48:44.352]  I'm not sure what we're showing up on screen, Russia there.
[03:48:45.073 --> 03:48:46.594]  But let's talk about that again for a second here.
[03:48:47.394 --> 03:48:51.537]  Russia loses UN Human Rights Council place, Saudi Arabia re-elected.
[03:48:52.198 --> 03:48:55.520]  So to get into this one, truly an amazing headline.
[03:48:56.100 --> 03:49:03.085]  The 47 places on the council are distributed on a regional basis, with staggered ballots seeing a third of the body re-elected each year.
[03:49:03.545 --> 03:49:08.849]  Russia had finished its three-year term and was running against Hungary and Croatia for the two available seats from Eastern Europe.
[03:49:09.389 --> 03:49:17.072]  With Hungary far ahead, Croatia received the votes of 114 of the 193 member countries and Russia was selected on 112 ballots.
[03:49:18.492 --> 03:49:29.076]  Saudi Arabia sailed through the Asian ballot with 152 votes and will represent the region on the UNHRC alongside China, Japan and Iraq for the next three years.
[03:49:29.176 --> 03:49:30.137]  China's great too!
[03:49:31.397 --> 03:49:34.718]  South Africa, Rwanda, Egypt and Tunisia were chosen from the African group.
[03:49:34.838 --> 03:49:41.759]  Cuba and Brazil from Latin America and the Caribbean and the US and UK will represent Western bloc which compromises Western Europe and North America.
[03:49:42.619 --> 03:49:50.240]  So the 14 chosen members will be tasked with formulating the UN's official position on conflicts occurring around the world as well as the domestic policies of member states.
[03:49:51.141 --> 03:49:57.382]  And NATO is tasking Germany with protecting Lithuania and stationing tanks on the border to defend against Russia.
[03:49:59.102 --> 03:50:16.355]  This is important to think about the concept of Saudi Arabia being a dignitary, a written authority on developing the United Nations official doctrine on how to deal and how to correspond with human rights.
[03:50:17.096 --> 03:50:17.356]  Okay?
[03:50:17.816 --> 03:50:19.217]  And kicking Russia out.
[03:50:19.978 --> 03:50:21.119]  But Saudi Arabia gets 152 votes.
[03:50:23.200 --> 03:50:28.201]  Who are the 152 people that think it's okay that Saudi Arabia treats women like dogs?
[03:50:28.621 --> 03:50:30.982]  Because you see, I'm for real human rights.
[03:50:31.262 --> 03:50:42.125]  I'm for real women's rights, as in giving them power to do what they want to do with their life and meaningful purpose, not chopping their arms off for talking to men that they're not related to.
[03:50:42.898 --> 03:50:48.202]  But, once again, see that's the insanity that most people realize but they don't want to talk about because it's scary.
[03:50:48.382 --> 03:50:49.763]  It's scary to talk about things like that.
[03:50:50.083 --> 03:50:50.663]  We'll be right back.
[03:50:51.024 --> 03:50:52.605]  This is the Alex Jones Show Fourth Hour.
[03:50:52.625 --> 03:50:53.405]  A lot more to come.
[03:50:53.646 --> 03:50:54.066]  Stay tuned.
[03:51:10.908 --> 03:51:13.189]  We are living in very perilous times.
[03:51:13.749 --> 03:51:20.792]  Things seem to be spinning out of control much faster than the powers that be can handle them.
[03:51:21.012 --> 03:51:29.316]  They've created these structures, these forces in the world that are now beyond their grasp.
[03:51:29.916 --> 03:51:31.637]  They've created things.
[03:51:31.697 --> 03:51:33.197]  They created ISIS, for example.
[03:51:33.838 --> 03:51:38.920]  They created the civil war, which became a regional war in Syria.
[03:51:40.220 --> 03:51:42.742]  And all of these things have spun out of control.
[03:51:44.163 --> 03:51:48.445]  It's like Yeats' poem, you know, spinning and spinning in a widening gyre.
[03:51:49.466 --> 03:51:51.547]  That's the situation we're in now.
[03:51:52.447 --> 03:51:56.870]  And we are, as you mentioned, very near the brink of a third world war.
[03:51:57.957 --> 03:52:15.873]  And we have Hillary Clinton, for the sake of political gain, playing brinksmanship, pushing toward activating a no-fly zone over Syria, which would indeed be a severe provocation.
[03:52:15.973 --> 03:52:21.138]  All it takes is one or two Russian aircraft being shot down.
[03:52:22.414 --> 03:52:23.615]  And it'll be game on.
[03:52:24.295 --> 03:52:33.161]  You know, not only is she running a kleptocratic system, but when she's personally a kleptomaniac, what does that tell you?
[03:52:35.743 --> 03:52:39.025]  I cannot believe that this woman is being seriously considered.
[03:52:39.765 --> 03:52:55.889]  As a presidential candidate, and with just the torrent of information that's coming out of WikiLeaks right now, from within the DNC, from within the Clinton Foundation, it just absolutely boggles the mind to think that she's being considered seriously.
[03:52:57.908 --> 03:53:12.586]  We have a situation where we may have a manipulated presidential election, may have a split outcome with a difference between the popular vote and the electoral vote, and we have a
[03:53:14.431 --> 03:53:27.976]  A kind of a criminal power structure in place right now that's willing to either collapse the system or bring the world to another world war just for the sake of furthering their own power.
[03:53:28.656 --> 03:53:31.977]  That's how absolutely corrupt and evil they are.
[03:53:32.857 --> 03:53:43.141]  It's amazing to see so many people with such corrupt morals and so downright sociopathic or psychopathic.
[03:53:43.981 --> 03:53:54.246]  Rise to levels of power and influence where the most power-hungry amongst them are actually the ones who want to be behind the scenes.
[03:53:54.427 --> 03:53:57.568]  It's the United States that's the provocateur here.
[03:53:58.289 --> 03:54:01.290]  We're the one provoking Russia.
[03:54:02.511 --> 03:54:06.553]  And we've been at it for four years with the Ukraine.
[03:54:06.953 --> 03:54:10.715]  And that game has turned into brinksmanship.
[03:54:13.942 --> 03:54:15.452]  We're good.
[03:54:20.356 --> 03:54:25.800]  In 1814, we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[03:54:25.820 --> 03:54:29.602]  We took a little bacon and we took a little pizza and we caught the Woodford in New Orleans.
[03:54:50.696 --> 03:54:53.438]  Reportedly, ovarian cancer from baby powder.
[03:54:53.458 --> 03:54:54.299]  We're going to talk about that.
[03:54:54.319 --> 03:54:58.943]  We're going to talk about ex-Putin adviser's death in Washington Hotel was a complete accident.
[03:54:59.403 --> 03:55:02.926]  He was found with extensive injuries in his hotel and then it was an accident.
[03:55:04.047 --> 03:55:07.529]  And ISIS reportedly murders hundreds of Iraqi civilians as it defends Mosul.
[03:55:08.570 --> 03:55:14.132]  But first, I did want to remind you one final time, because it is Friday, this is the last segment of the show.
[03:55:14.152 --> 03:55:15.333]  It's your last chance.
[03:55:15.553 --> 03:55:20.275]  Infowarslife.com, BrainForce, 25% off, mega sale is ending this weekend.
[03:55:20.895 --> 03:55:24.357]  As soon as it starts to really sell out, they're going to have to raise it back to full retail price.
[03:55:25.692 --> 03:55:27.514]  And it will be over.
[03:55:28.194 --> 03:55:29.755]  So now is your time.
[03:55:29.815 --> 03:55:31.877]  If you already have tried Brain Force, you like it, stock up.
[03:55:31.977 --> 03:55:32.937]  It's 25% off.
[03:55:32.998 --> 03:55:34.178]  It's pretty, pretty absurd.
[03:55:34.198 --> 03:55:37.121]  I pop at least two of those every morning.
[03:55:37.421 --> 03:55:38.201]  Makes me feel really good.
[03:55:38.221 --> 03:55:39.102]  I don't drink coffee.
[03:55:39.162 --> 03:55:39.923]  I don't like coffee.
[03:55:40.583 --> 03:55:42.244]  I like Brain Force instead.
[03:55:42.264 --> 03:55:45.166]  And I didn't even used to take anything like it.
[03:55:45.186 --> 03:55:48.089]  I actually kind of had an aversion to the idea at first.
[03:55:48.829 --> 03:55:55.815]  But once we started developing it, and I tried it, I was like, oh wow, I don't really feel speedy or anything like that, I just kind of feel focused and clear.
[03:55:56.676 --> 03:56:00.039]  And a lot of people seem to say the same thing, and there's a lot of five-star reviews about it.
[03:56:00.099 --> 03:56:03.803]  SwimmingForrestLife.com, BrainForrest, 25% off, ending this weekend.
[03:56:04.583 --> 03:56:05.664]  And, the storable food...
[03:56:06.653 --> 03:56:13.757]  By InfoWars Select is 30 to 40 percent off and once again lasts 25 years.
[03:56:13.837 --> 03:56:21.661]  So if you decide in 24 years and nine months and two days that you don't want to use it anymore because everything's peachy and everything's great, that's awesome.
[03:56:21.941 --> 03:56:24.342]  You can eat it, cook it up, give it to homeless shelter.
[03:56:24.942 --> 03:56:30.845]  It's real food so it's not like, you know, you have no use for it even if you don't, you know, need it for an emergency which hopefully you won't.
[03:56:31.266 --> 03:56:32.126]  But it's good insurance.
[03:56:32.306 --> 03:56:35.328]  It's like going to the grocery store for 25 years in case something happens.
[03:56:35.968 --> 03:56:37.790]  Alright, now let's get into some of this news.
[03:56:38.831 --> 03:56:41.233]  Johnson & Johnson loses baby powder cancer case.
[03:56:41.494 --> 03:56:43.516]  California woman awarded $70 million.
[03:56:43.536 --> 03:56:44.917]  So, St.
[03:56:44.957 --> 03:56:52.725]  Louis jury on Thursday awarded a California woman more than $70 million in her lawsuit alleging that years of using Johnson & Johnson's baby powder, which everyone uses by the way,
[03:56:53.726 --> 03:56:59.067]  Caused her cancer at the latest case, raising concerns about the health ramifications of extended talcum powder.
[03:56:59.388 --> 03:57:00.828]  Yes, talcum itself.
[03:57:01.388 --> 03:57:07.210]  The jury ruling ended the trial that began September 26th, and she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2012.
[03:57:07.310 --> 03:57:09.870]  We're pleased the jury did the right thing.
[03:57:09.910 --> 03:57:15.732]  They once again reaffirmed the need for Johnson & Johnson to warn the public of the ovarian cancer risk associated with this product.
[03:57:16.638 --> 03:57:18.582]  Earlier this year, two other lawsuits in St.
[03:57:18.963 --> 03:57:21.007]  Louis ended in jury verdicts with a combined $127 million.
[03:57:25.049 --> 03:57:30.054]  Two others in New Jersey were thrown out and other individuals won.
[03:57:30.074 --> 03:57:34.559]  2,000 women have filed lawsuits that were similar and lawyers are reviewing thousands of other potential cases.
[03:57:34.619 --> 03:57:35.741]  So it's a serious deal.
[03:57:36.141 --> 03:57:38.063]  Yet, of course, no one talks about that.
[03:57:38.544 --> 03:57:44.570]  And Johnson & Johnson just pays off the fees and the fines and continues operations.
[03:57:45.111 --> 03:57:46.813]  So definitely want to investigate that.
[03:57:47.830 --> 03:57:48.570]  Now let's talk about this.
[03:57:48.710 --> 03:57:51.451]  Ex-Putin adviser death in Washington hotel accident.
[03:57:51.511 --> 03:57:56.612]  This is what we're talking about when I say that 95% of things that go on, it's all interplay.
[03:57:56.932 --> 03:58:07.815]  It's all the politicians themselves with their little weird vendettas and they're all like trying to screw everyone over, like one over and like get ranked up and there's little micro attacks happening and mega cyber attacks.
[03:58:08.795 --> 03:58:08.895]  U.S.
[03:58:08.935 --> 03:58:14.657]  officials say the death of a former Vladimir Putin advisor, his top one, whose body was found in Washington, D.C.
[03:58:14.697 --> 03:58:16.718]  with extensive injuries, was an accident.
[03:58:17.318 --> 03:58:21.400]  An acute ethanol intoxication was a contributory case of his death.
[03:58:21.900 --> 03:58:28.142]  He was found alone in his DuPont Circle hotel room with blunt force injuries to his head, neck, torso, upper body, and lower extremities.
[03:58:28.822 --> 03:58:30.803]  Clearly, it was just an accident.
[03:58:30.823 --> 03:58:30.963]  See?
[03:58:31.503 --> 03:58:32.924]  That's why you read these headlines.
[03:58:33.605 --> 03:58:34.425]  It's so absurd.
[03:58:34.525 --> 03:58:36.206]  Why would... It's so crazy.
[03:58:36.507 --> 03:58:37.888]  So blatant and broad.
[03:58:38.668 --> 03:58:38.968]  All right.
[03:58:39.168 --> 03:58:40.730]  It has been an exciting fourth hour.
[03:58:40.870 --> 03:58:41.850]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:58:41.910 --> 03:58:42.991]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:58:43.011 --> 03:58:45.333]  Alex will be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:58:45.613 --> 03:58:46.954]  Central Time, live.
[03:58:47.294 --> 03:58:48.495]  Lots more to discuss.
[03:58:51.237 --> 03:58:54.899]  You are listening to GCN.
[03:58:54.919 --> 03:58:56.961]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:59:01.556 --> 03:59:05.098]  Here's complete garbage from Caroline Winter at Bloomberg.com.
[03:59:05.359 --> 03:59:05.839]  Headline!
[03:59:05.999 --> 03:59:10.542]  Some cities want their immigrants to vote, but Caroline forgot a very important word in that headline.
[03:59:10.762 --> 03:59:11.323]  Illegal!
[03:59:11.503 --> 03:59:18.708]  San Francisco is the latest city to consider taking votes from non-citizens, people with a green card, visas, or no documentation at all.
[03:59:19.108 --> 03:59:19.788]  Got an ID?
[03:59:19.988 --> 03:59:20.188]  No.
[03:59:20.389 --> 03:59:21.089]  Got a green card?
[03:59:21.329 --> 03:59:21.509]  No.
[03:59:21.810 --> 03:59:22.410]  Got a visa?
[03:59:22.670 --> 03:59:22.850]  No.
[03:59:23.150 --> 03:59:23.791]  Are you a citizen?
[03:59:24.051 --> 03:59:24.231]  No.
[03:59:24.592 --> 03:59:25.473]  Okay, here's your ballot.
[03:59:25.833 --> 03:59:36.084]  They claim Russia is rigging or may interfere with the election through hacking, but if Russia really wanted to interfere, they would just fly millions of people over here to vote Donald Trump in battleground states.
