[00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:16.702]  Ladies and gentlemen... Wow!
[00:00:17.163 --> 00:00:19.905]  The answer to 1984... Wow!
[00:00:20.105 --> 00:00:20.586]  ...is 1776.
[00:00:21.346 --> 00:00:22.067]  Wow!
[00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:25.430]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:31.656]  I tell you, who would have thought Donald Trump would be the man to deliver the republic from the brink of death?
[00:00:32.697 --> 00:00:35.539]  He could not have picked somebody better for Attorney General than Senator Sessions.
[00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.541]  He is gonna burn the globes to the ground.
[00:00:38.402 --> 00:00:40.023]  DrudgeReport.com says it all.
[00:00:40.244 --> 00:00:43.806]  The globalists are meeting, panicking, trying to save their program.
[00:00:44.267 --> 00:00:46.729]  In Obama's own words, globalism is in crisis.
[00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.273]  The New York Times responds saying globalism does not exist and I am insane.
[00:00:53.074 --> 00:01:00.860]  So that talk about quadrupling down, I mean these people literally are trying to engage in mind control and it isn't working.
[00:01:01.806 --> 00:01:03.887]  The fake news narrative is imploding as well.
[00:01:04.247 --> 00:01:05.308]  That's coming up after the break.
[00:01:05.348 --> 00:01:09.871]  But first, Paul Watson on the arrogance of the dying true fake news.
[00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:19.616]  Having lost the election and lost the argument, the butthurt left and the rigged media is desperate to salvage some scrap of credibility.
[00:01:19.656 --> 00:01:27.841]  So they've decided to create a new panic over so-called fake news, pressuring Google and Facebook to take action against fake news websites.
[00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:34.847]  Oh, and when they say fake news, that includes any reporting or opinion that contradicts their leftist narrative.
[00:01:34.907 --> 00:01:45.057]  The blacklist that all the mainstream media websites are circulating as the official designation of what constitutes fake news includes InfoWars and Breitbart.
[00:01:45.117 --> 00:01:46.698]  Well, imagine my shock!
[00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:52.643]  But this list of fake news websites, it had to be created by a reasoned, level-headed, impartial source.
[00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:55.386]  There can't be any bias involved in this, right?
[00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:55.826]  Wrong!
[00:01:56.006 --> 00:02:08.677]  It was created by a radical leftist safe space social justice warrior assistant professor who describes herself as a feminist activist and who supports extreme left-wing groups like Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street.
[00:02:08.717 --> 00:02:10.459]  Well imagine my shock!
[00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:27.133]  So the media is circulating a list of fake news websites created by an incredibly biased left-wing social justice warrior, which just by coincidence is full of conservative news websites, and then demanding Google and Facebook censor that content.
[00:02:27.193 --> 00:02:31.737]  This is all happening while Twitter also mass purges so-called alt-right accounts.
[00:02:31.997 --> 00:02:34.779]  For daring to express unauthorized opinions.
[00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:44.807]  They're also promoting a Chrome browser extension that automatically flags so-called fake news websites based on this same SJW-created blacklist.
[00:02:45.047 --> 00:02:49.451]  And, imagine my shock, InfoWars.com is on that list.
[00:02:49.571 --> 00:02:49.871]  Listen.
[00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:52.692]  We all know that there are actual fake news websites.
[00:02:52.732 --> 00:02:54.373]  They're pretty easy to spot.
[00:02:54.693 --> 00:02:57.874]  And some of them even admit that they're fake news websites.
[00:02:57.954 --> 00:03:04.696]  But there's a difference between fake news stories like this and having a conservative opinion.
[00:03:04.776 --> 00:03:12.059]  And anyway, who gave the mainstream media the right to be judge, jury and executioner of what constitutes fake news?
[00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.760]  All you do is put out fake news.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.980]  You're the aficionados of fake news.
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.742]  You put out the fake news that Hillary Clinton was 98% likely to win the presidency.
[00:03:23.842 --> 00:03:28.583]  You printed out and shipped copies of Newsweek celebrating Madame President.
[00:03:28.723 --> 00:03:33.024]  You said the Cubs had a smaller chance of winning than Donald Trump.
[00:03:33.144 --> 00:03:38.125]  You put out fake rigged polls that were proven spectacularly wrong.
[00:03:38.265 --> 00:03:39.465]  You put out fake
[00:03:39.725 --> 00:03:43.787]  Rape stories that ruin people's lives over and over again.
[00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:48.909]  You fake interviews with your own cameramen claiming they're anti-Trump protesters.
[00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:56.633]  You create fake narratives like Trump being responsible for violence at his own rallies when it was DNC-funded agitators all along.
[00:03:56.793 --> 00:04:02.155]  By this measure, nearly every mainstream media outlet should be put on a fake news list.
[00:04:02.315 --> 00:04:10.238]  Oh yeah, and when some fake news website puts out a fake news story, the worst case scenario is that someone makes some ill-gotten advertising dollars.
[00:04:10.338 --> 00:04:20.001]  When the mainstream media peddles fake news, like the fake news story that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, hundreds of thousands of people die.
[00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:20.581]  You're the f***er!
[00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.722]  Experts at fake news.
[00:04:22.802 --> 00:04:26.304]  So how dare you accuse us of being fake news?
[00:04:26.464 --> 00:04:28.825]  And why the hell should anyone trust you?
[00:04:29.105 --> 00:04:32.186]  As WikiLeaks exposed, you're not the fourth estate.
[00:04:32.446 --> 00:04:36.008]  You're a public relations front for the Democratic Party.
[00:04:36.088 --> 00:04:37.409]  You lost the argument.
[00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:39.410]  You trashed your own credibility.
[00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.712]  And now you're trying to resurrect it by claiming that everyone who beat you is fake news.
[00:04:44.792 --> 00:04:46.333]  Give me a break.
[00:04:46.513 --> 00:04:47.614]  No one trusts you.
[00:04:48.234 --> 00:04:51.716]  That's why you have to resort to dirty tricks and censorship.
[00:04:51.856 --> 00:04:53.096]  And it's not going to work.
[00:04:53.397 --> 00:04:54.677]  Because you suck.
[00:04:55.097 --> 00:04:55.738]  You lie.
[00:04:56.198 --> 00:05:00.400]  And everyone knows now that you're fake news.
[00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:06.163]  That extremely powerful report is on Infowars.com.
[00:05:06.223 --> 00:05:08.264]  I'm gonna tweet it right now at RealAlexJones.
[00:05:08.304 --> 00:05:08.904]  Let's share it.
[00:05:10.325 --> 00:05:16.007]  Donald Trump is not even president yet and he is already cashing in on his word of bringing jobs back to America.
[00:05:16.227 --> 00:05:21.648]  I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
[00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:24.869]  I'll bring back our jobs and I'll bring back our money.
[00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:32.531]  Ford has decided to continue to manufacture its Lincoln MKC in Louisville, Kentucky and not move to Mexico as they had previously planned.
[00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:38.634]  Ford has said they are happy to work with President Trump and are glad he is making American manufacturing competitive and great again.
[00:05:38.874 --> 00:05:43.336]  Reports are also surfacing that Apple is considering manufacturing their iPhones in California.
[00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:49.939]  Apple has asked its Asian-based manufacturers Foxconn and Pegatron to explore manufacturing their iPhones in America.
[00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:54.021]  Are these the first dominoes to get Americans off the welfare state and into the workforce?
[00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:58.242]  Will there be a time when you can pick up an electronic and it says Made in America?
[00:05:58.482 --> 00:06:00.543]  Coming soon to a presidency near you.
[00:06:00.843 --> 00:06:05.705]  I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
[00:06:05.805 --> 00:06:06.345]  I tell you that.
[00:06:07.065 --> 00:06:09.506]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com
[00:06:10.166 --> 00:06:15.429]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse, minor words, and his was action.
[00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.551]  His was what he's done to women.
[00:06:17.591 --> 00:06:23.254]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[00:06:23.474 --> 00:06:25.796]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[00:06:26.156 --> 00:06:32.340]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously, four of them here tonight.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.763]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[00:06:48.598 --> 00:06:51.341]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[00:06:52.202 --> 00:06:53.663]  It's a fight for our minds.
[00:06:54.324 --> 00:06:56.266]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[00:06:56.586 --> 00:07:00.790]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.274]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[00:07:04.354 --> 00:07:05.915]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:07:19.924 --> 00:07:27.834]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:27.894 --> 00:07:30.997]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[00:07:31.806 --> 00:07:33.666]  And they're also very affordable.
[00:07:55.791 --> 00:08:02.536]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us and it's changed my life and it's also helped the InfoWar change the country and the world.
[00:08:02.936 --> 00:08:03.697]  It's a win-win.
[00:08:04.177 --> 00:08:15.665]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:08:16.486 --> 00:08:17.226]  Big Brother.
[00:08:18.587 --> 00:08:19.828]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:21.389 --> 00:08:22.450]  Government Cover Us.
[00:08:24.014 --> 00:08:24.894]  You want answers?
[00:08:25.875 --> 00:08:27.555]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:27.795 --> 00:08:34.137]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:35.177 --> 00:08:46.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, to say that the news isn't incredibly positive across the board is an understatement.
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.561]  I tend to celebrate things
[00:08:51.835 --> 00:08:54.156]  After the fact, I tend to also grieve after the fact.
[00:08:54.816 --> 00:09:01.218]  I won't cry at, say, a grandparent's funeral, but I'll start bawling a week or a month later, or maybe a year later.
[00:09:02.359 --> 00:09:05.920]  But I tell you, when it comes to celebrating, I am in ecstasy right now.
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:10.161]  I am higher than a kite, and the only drug I've taken today is a half cup of coffee.
[00:09:11.262 --> 00:09:13.082]  I am higher than a kite right now.
[00:09:13.162 --> 00:09:14.723]  I am feeling so good.
[00:09:16.863 --> 00:09:21.726]  Because I've had time to really analyze what's happening and really track what Trump's really up to.
[00:09:22.727 --> 00:09:25.509]  From the outside and the inside, and I'm telling you, it's beautiful.
[00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.851]  That said, I don't see how they won't kill him.
[00:09:29.031 --> 00:09:30.152]  They're so damn arrogant.
[00:09:30.172 --> 00:09:31.553]  They don't care if it makes them a martyr.
[00:09:32.053 --> 00:09:37.237]  These people are very ham-fisted at this point because their best laid plans have gone astray.
[00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.633]  Ford is announcing that it's not going to move its plants out of the U.S.
[00:09:43.713 --> 00:09:44.513]  Not just one plant.
[00:09:44.574 --> 00:09:47.616]  It's now being announced that there's a whole initiative to just keep them here, period.
[00:09:50.058 --> 00:09:54.622]  Apple is now announcing they're going to move one of their main plants out of China to the United States.
[00:09:54.642 --> 00:09:55.523]  They said they're looking at it.
[00:09:55.583 --> 00:09:56.543]  It's basically a done deal.
[00:09:58.265 --> 00:10:01.728]  All because they know Trump is going to burn them if they don't.
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.601]  And China can go to hell.
[00:10:05.401 --> 00:10:08.683]  They can have, you know, 20-plus Foxconn labs for Apple.
[00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:09.964]  Can we have one?
[00:10:10.244 --> 00:10:13.346]  Can we maybe, you get 20-something, we get one?
[00:10:13.847 --> 00:10:14.847]  This isn't a trade war.
[00:10:15.868 --> 00:10:17.689]  The globalists have had their foot on our neck.
[00:10:17.749 --> 00:10:31.198]  And by the way, all these top analysts are now admitting, okay, the dollar's up, okay, all these equities are up, okay, yes, yes, this will make the average person more wealthy, yes, what Trump's doing is classic America, okay, yeah.
[00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:36.733]  But they'd all been intimidated and didn't have leadership to do this.
[00:10:39.035 --> 00:10:47.621]  He's now announcing Senator Jeff Sessions, who is one of the most honorable men in modern history, to be the new Attorney General.
[00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:49.542]  Could not have had a better pick.
[00:10:49.922 --> 00:10:53.625]  I am just... Notice it's not who they kept saying, Giuliani and people like that.
[00:10:55.137 --> 00:10:55.798]  Splendid!
[00:10:56.699 --> 00:10:57.500]  Splendid!
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.022]  Splendid!
[00:10:59.702 --> 00:11:00.784]  Splendid!
[00:11:01.204 --> 00:11:01.945]  Delicious!
[00:11:01.965 --> 00:11:08.293]  Oh, oh, it's just, it's just, literally, I have hundreds of articles here, each one better than the next.
[00:11:09.354 --> 00:11:10.355]  Just each one better than the next.
[00:11:10.896 --> 00:11:12.618]  Just look at this on the fake news front.
[00:11:14.394 --> 00:11:23.918]  We've looked forever for the name, the dinosaur media, the deception media, the prostitute, the scumbags, the collaborator media, but you know, they are the fake news media, the fake corporate media.
[00:11:24.138 --> 00:11:25.839]  And I've called them that before, but that's the name.
[00:11:26.179 --> 00:11:29.100]  They're now giving us that name because we're stomping them into oblivion.
[00:11:30.761 --> 00:11:38.804]  The Awakening is just absolutely ultra-massive, colossal, gargantuan, explosive to the power of ten.
[00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:47.992]  And so they come out with some cat lady, nothing against cats, but I mean, it's always got to be a cat lady wearing ironic glasses.
[00:11:49.133 --> 00:11:59.275]  A professor made a list of what's fake, and so Google adopted it, and then Quantcast adopted it, and then we learned it's this whole way to purge libertarian and nationalistic media that's dominant.
[00:12:01.716 --> 00:12:02.296]  Guess what they did?
[00:12:02.356 --> 00:12:05.537]  Quantcast removed it and actually showed us what our ranking was today.
[00:12:05.857 --> 00:12:07.558]  They agreed, okay, yes, you're not fake news.
[00:12:08.732 --> 00:12:10.893]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just challenged him.
[00:12:10.933 --> 00:12:16.715]  We said, listen, I know you're a cat lady and a social justice warrior, and you think men existing is bad.
[00:12:16.755 --> 00:12:18.896]  I mean, she literally just thinks men are bad, period.
[00:12:19.076 --> 00:12:19.717]  We get you.
[00:12:19.757 --> 00:12:20.457]  You're entitled.
[00:12:20.497 --> 00:12:21.357]  You think you're God.
[00:12:21.597 --> 00:12:26.539]  You live, you know, like a hobbit in your little university in fantasy world.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.740]  But guess what InfoWars is?
[00:12:29.341 --> 00:12:32.082]  I kept saying it was 167 as of last week.
[00:12:32.182 --> 00:12:33.983]  To give you an idea, Drudge is like 90-something.
[00:12:34.423 --> 00:12:35.683]  InfoWars.com is 126.
[00:12:38.644 --> 00:12:41.085]  All they do is hook into Google Analytics.
[00:12:41.125 --> 00:12:41.845]  We have these numbers.
[00:12:41.885 --> 00:12:43.145]  We're even bigger than that.
[00:12:43.765 --> 00:12:45.066]  Now, here's the key.
[00:12:45.846 --> 00:12:47.846]  InfoWars is not the center of what we do.
[00:12:48.846 --> 00:12:49.187]  It's not.
[00:12:50.027 --> 00:12:50.967]  It's like 25%.
[00:12:51.167 --> 00:12:53.188]  Do you have any idea how big it is?
[00:12:53.228 --> 00:12:54.188]  I mean, I'm not even bragging.
[00:12:54.608 --> 00:12:58.489]  I just realized I need to throw it in the enemy's face and just laugh at them.
[00:12:59.549 --> 00:13:03.650]  We're bigger than the BBC and CNN combined.
[00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.270]  We're bigger than the New York Times.
[00:13:05.751 --> 00:13:07.291]  These people are delusional.
[00:13:08.925 --> 00:13:16.535]  And guess what, a Mexican kingpin, who's not even Mexican, a Middle Eastern kingpin doesn't finance us, our listeners do.
[00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:20.441]  It's just a beautiful American system.
[00:13:20.501 --> 00:13:22.383]  We are wrecking you.
[00:13:22.403 --> 00:13:25.067]  So I want to salute DrudgeReport.com.
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.301]  More than anybody in this fight, going back even 10 years ago, supporting us, taking a lot of heat, I know, for it.
[00:13:31.681 --> 00:13:34.682]  But Drudge knew we were hardcore, cutting-edge news, and we've developed over the years.
[00:13:35.082 --> 00:13:36.803]  InfoWars isn't even really a modern design.
[00:13:36.823 --> 00:13:39.943]  We're going to redo it soon so it looks cleaner and better, like Breitbart or other sites.
[00:13:40.924 --> 00:13:45.625]  But, I mean, just with an old design and stuff that's like four or five years old, we are wrecking the enemy.
[00:13:46.425 --> 00:13:46.986]  Because of you.
[00:13:47.446 --> 00:13:48.347]  You are the info war.
[00:13:48.387 --> 00:13:49.688]  I keep explaining it, folks.
[00:13:50.268 --> 00:13:50.909]  It isn't hype.
[00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:55.973]  We have free market culture, Americana, the apple of the world's eye.
[00:13:56.374 --> 00:13:58.255]  We turn the breakers back on, folks.
[00:13:58.696 --> 00:14:00.097]  We'll be the shining city on the hill.
[00:14:01.618 --> 00:14:04.261]  And that's why they're panicking with their race garbage and all of it.
[00:14:04.941 --> 00:14:12.288]  I mean, trying to make the new majority that is Hispanics and Asians and others feel like they can't have the American dream.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.521]  That it's antithetical, that it's racist.
[00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:16.841]  Why'd you come here then?
[00:14:16.902 --> 00:14:20.023]  Because a shell of what was there is better than where you came from.
[00:14:20.123 --> 00:14:20.483]  I get it.
[00:14:21.084 --> 00:14:29.508]  You just can't come here and be indoctrinated into some brainwashed enemy of the middle class and be turned into an anti-white racist.
[00:14:29.528 --> 00:14:31.108]  It's not gonna happen.
[00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:32.169]  We're going to fight it.
[00:14:33.643 --> 00:14:38.206]  There's a lot of news on that front as well, but God forbid Trump bring back factories.
[00:14:38.827 --> 00:14:39.908]  Air conditioning factories.
[00:14:39.988 --> 00:14:41.129]  Refrigerator factories.
[00:14:42.209 --> 00:14:43.871]  Hundreds of them are announcing they're staying now.
[00:14:44.932 --> 00:14:46.533]  Because they were just waiting for the initiative.
[00:14:47.193 --> 00:14:48.454]  They were waiting for the president.
[00:14:48.955 --> 00:14:49.895]  They were waiting for the leader.
[00:14:50.696 --> 00:14:54.639]  Just like in Viva Vendetta, he's talking to the inspector and the inspector goes, why did you do it sooner?
[00:14:54.679 --> 00:14:55.139]  Why didn't you?
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.821]  He goes, I was waiting for you, man.
[00:14:57.892 --> 00:14:59.652]  I was waiting for a few good people on the inside.
[00:14:59.672 --> 00:15:00.772]  I was waiting for you.
[00:15:01.433 --> 00:15:09.054]  That's why they want us to start a civil war and go and shoot cops in the back of the head, like that's a revolution, because that will cause us all to implode and beat each other's throats.
[00:15:09.334 --> 00:15:10.234]  So let me explain something.
[00:15:10.534 --> 00:15:18.455]  We're not out of the woods yet, but baby, we are in the lead, and it's ours to lose, and I want to thank Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior.
[00:15:19.016 --> 00:15:22.616]  About four days before the election, I sincerely broke down and cried on air.
[00:15:23.736 --> 00:15:26.917]  And I used to maybe get tears in my eyes once or twice every couple years.
[00:15:27.858 --> 00:15:32.159]  Well, I thought about, you know, dead family or some sad story or saw something sad on the news.
[00:15:32.219 --> 00:15:33.059]  I'm a sentimental guy.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:43.222]  The tears in my eyes that I get at the dinner table at night and driving home from work now probably 50 times a day sometimes is the energy of the Republic coming back from the dead.
[00:15:43.262 --> 00:15:44.622]  These aren't tears of pain.
[00:15:45.062 --> 00:15:46.363]  These are tears of joy!
[00:15:46.383 --> 00:15:49.443]  That doesn't mean we're out of the woods.
[00:15:49.463 --> 00:15:51.264]  Doesn't mean evil isn't spiraling out of control.
[00:15:51.304 --> 00:15:55.585]  Doesn't mean there's not all the nanotech and GMO and genetic engineering and all of it.
[00:15:57.538 --> 00:16:09.091]  I can feel the spirit of good beginning to come back into the world right now, and people are breaking the bondage, they're coming out of the matrix, they're coming out of the lie, and you can feel it.
[00:16:09.352 --> 00:16:16.600]  It's like you go to a pep rally and you feel the energy, or a concert, the brainwaves, you can feel the electricity.
[00:16:17.061 --> 00:16:18.002]  And Trump feels it too.
[00:16:19.656 --> 00:16:21.257]  And Trump wants that positive energy.
[00:16:21.838 --> 00:16:24.079]  That's why he goes where the good is.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:28.023]  That's why he feeds off of it, because he's not out to get you.
[00:16:31.665 --> 00:16:35.128]  He thinks people love sitting around in gold palaces, like seeing people poor?
[00:16:35.168 --> 00:16:35.749]  No, he doesn't like it.
[00:16:36.769 --> 00:16:45.596]  Globalists, though, they admit that they engineered art and architecture in the last 60 years to make you feel ugly, to make you feel small, and to make you feel hopeless.
[00:16:45.636 --> 00:16:46.037]  Look it up.
[00:16:46.157 --> 00:16:47.498]  It's been declassified two years ago.
[00:16:48.726 --> 00:16:51.749]  CIA finance ugly architecture and art to make people feel small.
[00:16:52.529 --> 00:16:53.550]  That's not the CIA.
[00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:55.312]  That's criminals that have hijacked our government.
[00:16:59.175 --> 00:17:01.737]  So, the social engineers want to fight.
[00:17:02.398 --> 00:17:06.421]  As I've always said, I don't know how this is going to end, but it's the journey is the destination.
[00:17:06.461 --> 00:17:08.082]  It's the fighting that God wants to see.
[00:17:08.563 --> 00:17:09.263]  You want to fight?
[00:17:09.544 --> 00:17:12.166]  You better believe you've got one.
[00:17:13.547 --> 00:17:16.368]  And you can misrepresent what I say and twist it all day long.
[00:17:16.409 --> 00:17:20.631]  People come here in much bigger numbers than they come to you, and they find out what's really going on.
[00:17:20.891 --> 00:17:22.632]  And quite frankly, sometimes it's embarrassing how I act.
[00:17:22.652 --> 00:17:25.553]  Yesterday, I was so hateful towards these people because I hate them.
[00:17:25.613 --> 00:17:26.134]  They're out to get me.
[00:17:26.454 --> 00:17:26.894]  They're my enemy.
[00:17:26.914 --> 00:17:27.334]  They're your enemy.
[00:17:27.534 --> 00:17:29.715]  I'm so pissed at looking at them that I was being very nasty.
[00:17:29.896 --> 00:17:30.156]  You know what?
[00:17:30.176 --> 00:17:30.756]  I'm proud of that.
[00:17:30.796 --> 00:17:31.356]  That was real.
[00:17:31.536 --> 00:17:32.157]  That's who I am.
[00:17:32.397 --> 00:17:32.997]  I love a lot.
[00:17:33.117 --> 00:17:33.678]  I hate a lot.
[00:17:34.158 --> 00:17:35.799]  I'm not going to sit here and make excuses for it.
[00:17:36.599 --> 00:17:37.399]  I got a lot of hate.
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:39.741]  I got a lot of love.
[00:17:40.836 --> 00:17:41.576]  It's beyond hate.
[00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:45.037]  They're just despicable traitor filth.
[00:17:45.057 --> 00:17:46.558]  I don't want to think about them.
[00:17:46.598 --> 00:17:47.598]  Excuse me.
[00:17:47.638 --> 00:17:53.840]  I'm not a vindictive person, but I love seeing Hillary rotting and falling apart and just seeing that witch melt in front of our eyes.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.400]  Thank you, Jesus Christ.
[00:17:55.801 --> 00:17:57.441]  Thank you, Father above for your son.
[00:17:57.481 --> 00:17:58.501]  Thank you for the Holy Spirit.
[00:17:58.802 --> 00:18:01.382]  Thank you for goodness and thank you for everything you've done.
[00:18:01.522 --> 00:18:04.863]  We repent from what we've done and we commit to be better people.
[00:18:05.904 --> 00:18:07.464]  It is such a great time to be alive.
[00:18:08.104 --> 00:18:09.945]  I can feel the spirit of God rising.
[00:18:12.462 --> 00:18:17.444]  And the more God comes into the world, the more these evil people are just despicable and disgusting, aren't they?
[00:18:17.464 --> 00:18:21.745]  As your spirit gets stronger, you recognize them more, and you can't be around them.
[00:18:22.746 --> 00:18:27.948]  As we start resonating, ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna... That's why they hate us.
[00:18:28.188 --> 00:18:29.969]  They don't want us in the world, folks.
[00:18:30.229 --> 00:18:31.269]  We can't get along.
[00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:34.351]  The sheep and the goats don't coexist.
[00:18:34.391 --> 00:18:34.991]  Figure that out.
[00:18:36.651 --> 00:18:37.672]  They're not giving us quarter.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.342]  None, no quarter given, none taken.
[00:18:42.684 --> 00:18:44.446]  We're gonna run those black flags up, baby.
[00:18:45.787 --> 00:18:46.869]  Committed to this.
[00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:59.103]  And I can feel their howls of despair as their lust to hurt the innocent and their lust to make people poor and their lust to dominate and break society's will as their will is broken.
[00:19:01.991 --> 00:19:09.535]  The greatest psy-op was these controlled churches always telling you it's the end of the world right around the corner and give up because there's no point, you know, the devil runs everything.
[00:19:10.196 --> 00:19:12.357]  The devil's only here to test us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:12.537 --> 00:19:13.658]  I don't know what the future brings.
[00:19:13.758 --> 00:19:16.640]  Undoubtedly revelations will be fulfilled, but in God's time.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.041]  And any man that tells you he knows is an agent of the devil.
[00:19:20.582 --> 00:19:21.242]  That's Christ.
[00:19:22.323 --> 00:19:25.585]  Let no man deceive you and tell you he knows the hour of the day.
[00:19:25.605 --> 00:19:30.768]  It's all there.
[00:19:31.786 --> 00:19:36.953]  We're going to come back and I'm just... Oh my God, this is all luscious news.
[00:19:37.534 --> 00:19:39.056]  There's some important things we have to look at.
[00:19:39.497 --> 00:19:41.119]  Western women being raped in the Middle East.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.902]  When you get raped, you go to prison.
[00:19:43.783 --> 00:19:45.426]  Even if it's admitted, because you're not a person.
[00:19:45.966 --> 00:19:46.687]  And that's why...
[00:19:48.382 --> 00:19:53.123]  I'm a bigot because I don't want radical Islam running our entire country and world.
[00:19:53.544 --> 00:19:56.905]  And we've got the Islamists licking their butts and stuff.
[00:19:56.925 --> 00:19:57.725]  That's all coming up.
[00:19:58.465 --> 00:19:59.685]  I'm going to show you.
[00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:01.886]  In Italy, people basically licking their butts.
[00:20:02.226 --> 00:20:02.626]  Stay with us.
[00:20:04.567 --> 00:20:11.849]  I'm going to lay it out short and sweet.
[00:20:13.659 --> 00:20:19.323]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[00:20:20.023 --> 00:20:24.006]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[00:20:24.887 --> 00:20:27.108]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[00:20:27.188 --> 00:20:28.329]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.591]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[00:20:32.572 --> 00:20:32.912]  Or more.
[00:20:32.992 --> 00:20:34.974]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[00:20:35.434 --> 00:20:36.915]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[00:20:37.015 --> 00:20:40.357]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[00:20:40.457 --> 00:20:42.219]  It's actually scary.
[00:20:43.099 --> 00:20:53.189]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[00:20:54.190 --> 00:21:06.981]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support Infowars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.
[00:21:09.653 --> 00:21:33.132]  The entire corporate dinosaur media, from the New York Times to the Washington Post, London Guardian, are coming out and saying the campaign is imploding, that the transition team is in total disarray, that everyone is involved in a mass exodus, that they can't hire the 4,000 people needed to take over the executive branch, when in truth, they're going in and purging the executive branch of lobbyists.
[00:21:33.632 --> 00:21:40.695]  The number one promise that Donald Trump gave to the American people that he would do as soon as he got into office.
[00:21:40.855 --> 00:21:41.555]  You're fired!
[00:21:42.015 --> 00:21:42.656]  You're fired!
[00:21:49.758 --> 00:21:53.180]  Trump under budget, ahead of schedule, Obama
[00:21:54.238 --> 00:21:58.061]  Tripling the amount of money missing at the Pentagon when he was in office.
[00:21:58.601 --> 00:22:00.162]  Under budget, ahead of schedule.
[00:22:00.262 --> 00:22:01.063]  That's what this is.
[00:22:01.483 --> 00:22:04.625]  How are you liking the IRS fining you with penalties?
[00:22:04.886 --> 00:22:08.708]  How are you liking being raped by the so-called Democratic Party?
[00:22:08.908 --> 00:22:14.112]  To get a law which said healthy people are going to pay in, it made explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money.
[00:22:14.172 --> 00:22:14.933]  It would not have passed.
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:21.043]  Okay, just like people, lack of transparency is a huge political advantage.
[00:22:21.643 --> 00:22:29.287]  And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.
[00:22:29.387 --> 00:22:32.509]  The EPA with one of the biggest spills in our history.
[00:22:33.009 --> 00:22:37.692]  They didn't even try to contain it for several weeks because I guess it's okay when the government
[00:22:37.952 --> 00:22:39.633]  Dumps a bunch of cyanide into rivers.
[00:22:39.673 --> 00:22:46.759]  And while Obama was vacationing, and Hillary was napping during the floods in Louisiana and Mississippi, who came and visited?
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.901]  Who donated massive amounts of money?
[00:22:49.241 --> 00:22:54.185]  Who went through more than a dozen towns and hand-delivered the aid directly to the people?
[00:22:54.846 --> 00:22:57.288]  That's right, the incompetent Donald J. Trump.
[00:22:57.388 --> 00:23:06.516]  We have the vaccine makers of this country, who in the 1980s got Congress to pass a law shielding them from liability from their dangerous products.
[00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:19.924]  Well, Donald Trump has said vaccines should be investigated, that too many of them are being given, and that he is preparing for investigations into why so much autism is spreading across this country.
[00:23:19.944 --> 00:23:21.445]  It's part of population control.
[00:23:21.885 --> 00:23:35.113]  But when you look at the billions and billions of dollars paid out secretly through the vaccine damage fund that the media tries to keep from the public, it lets you know that the press certainly is incompetent for not doing their job and exposing how deep this rabbit hole goes.
[00:23:35.373 --> 00:23:45.320]  They're also saying fake news got him elected when it's mainstream media that's been caught lying and getting us into these wars and claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs when he didn't.
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:52.765]  And it was basically only Donald Trump, back at the time, that was going on Fox News and CNN saying, don't get into these wars.
[00:23:53.045 --> 00:24:00.791]  And if Donald Trump can even halfway drain the swamp, deliver tax cuts, secure our border, and make America great again,
[00:24:01.511 --> 00:24:09.196]  Donald Trump will go down in history as the greatest president in our entire incredible experience.
[00:24:15.345 --> 00:24:19.706]  When Trump has launched GreatAgain.gov.
[00:24:19.907 --> 00:24:21.747]  That's right, GreatAgain.gov.
[00:24:22.247 --> 00:24:23.408]  Thank you for your support.
[00:24:23.468 --> 00:24:26.129]  An actual federal government executive website.
[00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:31.010]  You can read about the president-elect, the vice president-elect, news, making America great again.
[00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:35.212]  Serving America, that means getting jobs in the executive branch.
[00:24:36.112 --> 00:24:41.314]  And I saw different clips last night of Jon Stewart and others saying, what does it mean to make it great again?
[00:24:41.354 --> 00:24:42.254]  No one ever asked him.
[00:24:42.918 --> 00:24:44.339]  No, it means cutting taxes.
[00:24:45.319 --> 00:24:47.740]  It means sending a lot of power back to the states.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:53.542]  It means doing the things that made this country so successful again and not running it down all day.
[00:24:55.863 --> 00:24:56.463]  That's what it means.
[00:24:56.483 --> 00:24:57.584]  And then they sell the idea.
[00:24:57.644 --> 00:24:59.284]  No, it means make it white again.
[00:25:00.185 --> 00:25:04.827]  Ladies and gentlemen, America in most areas is 50% Hispanic now.
[00:25:06.943 --> 00:25:12.688]  Now, if you look at demographics, like I said, in 10-15 years, depending on the demographics, 70% or more will be Hispanic.
[00:25:12.708 --> 00:25:18.153]  There have been Gallup polls where 71% of Hispanic Americans that are citizens want to control the border.
[00:25:18.533 --> 00:25:20.795]  Sure, every other Latin American country tries to control their border.
[00:25:20.815 --> 00:25:22.157]  You don't have a country if you don't.
[00:25:23.338 --> 00:25:25.359]  They've got new polls out where it's almost 60%.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.022]  But they have brainwashed some Hispanics that
[00:25:29.625 --> 00:25:34.327]  If someone likes Donald Trump, or someone wants to control the border, that there must be racists.
[00:25:34.367 --> 00:25:36.708]  No, we just can't have totally open borders.
[00:25:36.848 --> 00:25:37.528]  No one else does.
[00:25:37.548 --> 00:25:39.909]  This is globalism conquering our country.
[00:25:39.969 --> 00:25:41.830]  You're being used to do that.
[00:25:42.924 --> 00:25:48.689]  I would love it if it was a Hispanic president, or a woman president, if they were like Trump.
[00:25:48.849 --> 00:25:53.533]  I do not care what color their hair is, or what color their skin is, or what color their eyes are.
[00:25:53.813 --> 00:25:55.634]  I care about what's going on inside that brain.
[00:25:55.935 --> 00:25:57.816]  And Hillary Clinton is a demon witch.
[00:25:57.836 --> 00:26:00.118]  It has nothing to do with the fact that she's a woman.
[00:26:00.558 --> 00:26:01.859]  Oh, you just don't like strong women.
[00:26:01.959 --> 00:26:03.220]  Give me a break.
[00:26:04.481 --> 00:26:07.024]  Give me... I love strong women.
[00:26:07.064 --> 00:26:08.465]  Man, they can help me get stuff done.
[00:26:09.482 --> 00:26:11.124]  It's like saying, I don't want a strong wife.
[00:26:11.204 --> 00:26:14.788]  I don't want someone that helps me get stuff done or who's... I want... Are you kidding?
[00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:19.373]  What a man's looking for is a dynamic, strong woman.
[00:26:20.815 --> 00:26:23.397]  It's just total insulting of reality.
[00:26:23.498 --> 00:26:26.221]  Are there poor white people that look around?
[00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:34.154]  And see a bunch of Hispanics doing better than they are, because they're farmer generations and are working harder, and get pissed off?
[00:26:34.194 --> 00:26:34.414]  Sure!
[00:26:34.754 --> 00:26:37.696]  But that is underlying and very, very small.
[00:26:37.776 --> 00:26:41.498]  And it's just, again, they have tripled down on this entire race narrative.
[00:26:41.518 --> 00:26:43.860]  And the good news is, almost no one is buying it.
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:52.305]  And when Trump delivers prosperity, and the mainstream media tries to cover it up and sabotage it, it's going to be irrevocable.
[00:26:52.405 --> 00:26:53.286]  I am so glad.
[00:26:54.403 --> 00:27:00.704]  I was bummed out at first that mainstream media has just intensified their lies, but I understand that's a failed system they've been engaged in.
[00:27:02.025 --> 00:27:11.006]  And so, their playbook is a losing playbook, so if they're our enemy, we shouldn't interrupt our enemies while they're destroying themselves, should we?
[00:27:12.187 --> 00:27:13.827]  Now, this is a short segment.
[00:27:13.847 --> 00:27:15.567]  Let me tell you some of the news that's coming up in detail.
[00:27:16.047 --> 00:27:17.188]  Look at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:27:19.248 --> 00:27:22.649]  Obama is over in Germany and Europe.
[00:27:22.689 --> 00:27:23.809]  He just left Greece yesterday.
[00:27:25.094 --> 00:27:26.915]  He's trying to prop up globalism.
[00:27:27.235 --> 00:27:28.035]  And that's the headlines.
[00:27:28.095 --> 00:27:29.415]  Globalism in crisis.
[00:27:29.495 --> 00:27:30.996]  I mean, that's Financial Times of London.
[00:27:31.036 --> 00:27:31.516]  You name it.
[00:27:31.776 --> 00:27:32.536]  Der Spiegel.
[00:27:32.576 --> 00:27:33.656]  I've got stacks of news.
[00:27:33.977 --> 00:27:35.317]  Global government's in trouble.
[00:27:35.817 --> 00:27:36.297]  And what?
[00:27:37.137 --> 00:27:38.378]  What does Merkel say?
[00:27:39.238 --> 00:27:41.199]  She says we're not letting the EU go.
[00:27:41.379 --> 00:27:45.540]  German finance minister warns Britain could still be paying into Brussels' coffers in 2030.
[00:27:47.062 --> 00:27:48.803]  They're telling them, we're not letting you go.
[00:27:48.903 --> 00:27:50.464]  You never voted to be part of this.
[00:27:51.024 --> 00:27:52.305]  You're not allowed to leave now.
[00:27:52.645 --> 00:27:55.186]  You didn't do your Article 50 right, so you can't go.
[00:27:55.206 --> 00:27:58.768]  And as I said, folks, people go, oh, Brexit's been scuttled.
[00:27:59.208 --> 00:28:05.592]  We knew this would happen, but the process of forcing them out in the open to say you can't leave, we run you.
[00:28:05.612 --> 00:28:12.976]  I mean, 20 years ago, you couldn't get people to admit there was a European Union being set up.
[00:28:13.036 --> 00:28:14.136]  It was a conspiracy theory.
[00:28:14.316 --> 00:28:15.297]  When I was first on air,
[00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:20.573]  Just five years, six years before it was official, and it was already codified under law.
[00:28:20.773 --> 00:28:23.695]  They just hadn't announced it, kind of like the North American Union is already in place.
[00:28:23.955 --> 00:28:25.896]  The Asian Union's been in place for decades.
[00:28:26.416 --> 00:28:28.478]  They don't tell you until it's all done.
[00:28:29.158 --> 00:28:33.401]  And TPP was going to be done for the Asian Union, and the Atlantic Treaty between the U.S.
[00:28:34.382 --> 00:28:38.444]  and Europe was going to weld the three super states together.
[00:28:38.664 --> 00:28:40.445]  That's official Trilateral Commission info.
[00:28:40.926 --> 00:28:42.247]  But remember on Monday...
[00:28:44.182 --> 00:28:46.963]  The New York Times said Alex Jones is crazy.
[00:28:46.983 --> 00:28:47.823]  I have it right here.
[00:28:48.943 --> 00:28:51.044]  Globalism doesn't exist.
[00:28:51.704 --> 00:28:54.505]  Obama's in Germany saying we've got to defend globalism.
[00:28:54.845 --> 00:28:55.605]  It's in crisis.
[00:28:56.025 --> 00:29:01.786]  But here's the New York Times telling its readers it doesn't exist and it's code word for anti-Semitism.
[00:29:04.247 --> 00:29:05.687]  Where does this crap come from?
[00:29:06.748 --> 00:29:07.688]  The TPP?
[00:29:08.588 --> 00:29:10.269]  With more than 50 countries running us?
[00:29:10.289 --> 00:29:11.449]  What's that have to do with Jews?
[00:29:12.901 --> 00:29:15.884]  It's countries all over the world with corporations taking over our sovereignty.
[00:29:16.084 --> 00:29:17.145]  They just inject that.
[00:29:17.165 --> 00:29:18.806]  It's like, I don't like your health care plan.
[00:29:18.847 --> 00:29:19.347]  It's a rip-off.
[00:29:19.587 --> 00:29:20.428]  Shut up, racist!
[00:29:20.948 --> 00:29:22.089]  What's that have to do with racism?
[00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:22.850]  This is a rip-off.
[00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:24.071]  Shut up, racist!
[00:29:24.812 --> 00:29:26.033]  And then that's all you've got?
[00:29:26.093 --> 00:29:28.956]  Conspiracy terrorist, racist, and fake news.
[00:29:28.976 --> 00:29:29.276]  That's it.
[00:29:29.656 --> 00:29:31.198]  Racist, conspiracy terrorist, fake news.
[00:29:31.438 --> 00:29:34.901]  Throw in a homophobe, and you're like, when... I don't... What?
[00:29:35.962 --> 00:29:36.663]  I'm a Libertine.
[00:29:36.683 --> 00:29:37.303]  Everybody knows that.
[00:29:37.343 --> 00:29:38.785]  What are you... Stop it!
[00:29:40.882 --> 00:29:41.762]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:29:41.782 --> 00:29:43.423]  So when we come back, we've got a bunch of clips.
[00:29:43.863 --> 00:29:50.845]  We're going to get into all of this because their whole fake news initiative has blown up in their face spectacularly.
[00:29:51.505 --> 00:29:52.625]  Spectacularly.
[00:29:53.045 --> 00:29:57.847]  They're already reversing this blacklist that they're sending around, you know, saying, man, InfoWars.
[00:29:58.167 --> 00:29:58.647]  We'll be back.
[00:29:59.247 --> 00:30:00.127]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.627 --> 00:30:02.228]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.148 --> 00:30:05.849]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.819 --> 00:30:15.522]  Donald Trump is moving fast to build his new administration, making many key appointments thus far.
[00:30:15.902 --> 00:30:18.464]  President-elect Trump has named the following appointments.
[00:30:19.084 --> 00:30:22.066]  Senator from Alabama, Jeff Sessions, Attorney General.
[00:30:22.447 --> 00:30:25.829]  Representative from Kansas, Mike Pompeo, Head of CIA.
[00:30:26.209 --> 00:30:30.272]  Former Military Intelligence Chief, Michael Flynn, National Security Advisor.
[00:30:30.652 --> 00:30:33.493]  Media Executive Stephen Bannon, Chief Strategist.
[00:30:33.834 --> 00:30:37.916]  Chairman Republican National Committee Reince Priebus, White House Chief of Staff.
[00:30:38.356 --> 00:30:44.359]  Trump has also created a short list of possible appointees for other key spots, including a new Supreme Court Justice.
[00:30:44.799 --> 00:30:49.021]  Rumors are swirling that there may be a position for his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway.
[00:30:49.341 --> 00:30:56.449]  Former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani and even detractor Mitt Romney is being tossed around as a possible Secretary of State.
[00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:01.475]  While former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has said he will not be in a Trump administration.
[00:31:02.035 --> 00:31:02.776]  I'm Owen Troyer.
[00:31:02.976 --> 00:31:04.738]  For more go to InfoWars.com
[00:31:09.505 --> 00:31:13.889]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:31:14.009 --> 00:31:24.940]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:30.022]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:31:30.142 --> 00:31:32.664]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:34.224]  It helps detoxify.
[00:31:34.444 --> 00:31:37.266]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:31:37.326 --> 00:31:42.068]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:31:42.088 --> 00:31:46.210]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:48.252]  ...dependent upon selenium.
[00:31:48.292 --> 00:31:53.656]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:31:53.776 --> 00:31:55.198]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:31:55.398 --> 00:31:56.139]  This is so key.
[00:31:56.379 --> 00:32:00.683]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:32:00.703 --> 00:32:02.804]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:32:02.925 --> 00:32:06.388]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:32:09.685 --> 00:32:20.191]  If you ever wanted to live off the grid and produce your own clean energy in a silent, reliable way, this is a message you want to pay very close attention to.
[00:32:20.531 --> 00:32:31.178]  Thanks to a new development in solar generator technology, it's now possible for my listeners and viewers to produce their own source of emergency backup electricity.
[00:32:31.598 --> 00:32:34.560]  And even more importantly, it's now extremely affordable.
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:40.906]  Thanks to the guys at Solutions for Science, you can get one of these $6,000 solar generators for less than $1,500.
[00:32:43.349 --> 00:32:45.711]  We have these units at the office and at my home.
[00:32:46.052 --> 00:32:51.457]  I can run my sump pumps, my shortwave radios, all of my devices, and even keep our food from spoiling.

[00:32:57.023 --> 00:33:00.745]  Folks, there has never been a better time to get off the grid.
[00:33:01.105 --> 00:33:05.388]  It's going to be crucial in 2017, maybe even life-saving.
[00:33:05.708 --> 00:33:07.829]  Powergridchaos.com for 70% off.
[00:33:27.924 --> 00:33:29.665]  This is Clone Radio.
[00:33:29.885 --> 00:33:33.728]  We play the songs that sound more like everyone else than anyone else.
[00:33:33.928 --> 00:33:37.190]  Clone.
[00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:38.190]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:33:38.471 --> 00:33:39.491]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:33:39.791 --> 00:33:40.652]  Mao took the guns.
[00:33:40.832 --> 00:33:42.173]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[00:33:42.193 --> 00:33:42.393]  How many?
[00:33:42.433 --> 00:33:46.275]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[00:33:46.696 --> 00:33:49.637]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[00:33:50.878 --> 00:33:54.741]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[00:33:54.781 --> 00:33:56.922]  They did.
[00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:06.331]  Oaths have been given.
[00:34:06.351 --> 00:34:08.151]  They've been taken.
[00:34:08.171 --> 00:34:11.372]  The answer to 1980, they will be followed, is 1776.
[00:34:11.493 --> 00:34:16.434]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:16.854 --> 00:34:17.234]  Oaths.
[00:34:18.315 --> 00:34:19.235]  Oaths of old.
[00:34:20.255 --> 00:34:22.916]  The true power is the commitment of the will.
[00:34:29.339 --> 00:34:30.239]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:34:33.052 --> 00:34:36.114]  China presses tech firms to police the internet.
[00:34:38.075 --> 00:34:39.255]  That's a fake headline.
[00:34:39.415 --> 00:34:41.276]  It's a real story, but a fake headline.
[00:34:43.017 --> 00:34:44.158]  China is impressing.
[00:34:44.778 --> 00:34:49.421]  The Communist Party dirtbags, the biggest mass murderers in all of history.
[00:34:49.901 --> 00:34:59.045]  Over 100 million of their own people, 80 plus under Mao Zedong alone, who have got their people in total wicked bondage, involved in
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:10.185]  Political and cultural Congress with our elite are setting up a planetary system and there they are telling us what to do with Hollywood, telling us what to do with the internet.
[00:35:10.285 --> 00:35:15.268]  You think they like the fact they can't block this show, it's very hard for them to block this transmission going into China?
[00:35:16.869 --> 00:35:17.669]  You think they like that?
[00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:23.132]  You see mainstream media, we see the Democrats saying, Zuckerberg, you better censor the web more!
[00:35:24.333 --> 00:35:29.016]  Zuckerberg came out this week and said, it's not that easy, it isn't just a fake news issue and you know it.
[00:35:30.811 --> 00:35:34.813]  Because Peter Thiel owns part of Facebook and isn't letting him do it.
[00:35:34.833 --> 00:35:46.839]  I gotta say, Peter Thiel, more and more as I research him, I know he's gone to Bilderberg, I mean, I know it's a secret meeting, it's global, it's bad, but what matters is what people do in the real world.
[00:35:47.459 --> 00:35:51.561]  And if he's opposing tyranny, more and more, that's a good thing, and helping Trump get into office.
[00:35:52.542 --> 00:35:58.725]  And so the whole Bilderberg group has been against Trump, but just a few people on the inside that aren't bad can turn this whole tide.
[00:36:00.711 --> 00:36:01.091]  But look at this.
[00:36:01.151 --> 00:36:03.391]  China presses tech firms to police the internet.
[00:36:03.491 --> 00:36:11.233]  Third annual world internet conference aimed at proselytizing China's view to a global audience.
[00:36:11.273 --> 00:36:11.713]  That's right.
[00:36:12.233 --> 00:36:15.694]  The big world internet conference is basically run by China.
[00:36:17.094 --> 00:36:18.794]  China is making its move.
[00:36:18.974 --> 00:36:21.875]  When we say China, we mean the evil folks that run it.
[00:36:23.135 --> 00:36:24.915]  So we have the Chinese telling us what to do.
[00:36:24.955 --> 00:36:26.656]  We've got the EU telling us what to do.
[00:36:26.976 --> 00:36:28.756]  Saying globalism's in crisis, but
[00:36:30.683 --> 00:36:39.708]  Imagine being a New York Times writer and you have to sit there and write articles like Gibbs did, his press secretary, saying the drone program doesn't exist years after it's public.
[00:36:40.109 --> 00:36:41.850]  It's been on the news a thousand times, a thousand.
[00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:43.731]  Globalism!
[00:36:43.831 --> 00:36:46.813]  A far-right conspiracy theory buoyed by Trump!
[00:36:48.354 --> 00:36:53.817]  And we claim there's multinational corporations and multinational agreements that we're not part of and we claim it's transferring power.
[00:36:53.897 --> 00:36:55.098]  It's totally insane!
[00:36:56.667 --> 00:36:58.688]  Meanwhile, we're not letting the EU go.
[00:36:58.728 --> 00:37:02.431]  German finance minister warns Britain could still be paying into Brussels coffers in 2030.
[00:37:02.651 --> 00:37:08.795]  The rise of populism tops anxiety list at Frankfurt banking meeting.
[00:37:09.315 --> 00:37:11.016]  Oh, the anxiety!
[00:37:12.037 --> 00:37:13.678]  Globalist plot survival.
[00:37:13.738 --> 00:37:14.999]  I wish I could come up with terms like that.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:17.441]  Because that's what's happening.
[00:37:17.481 --> 00:37:22.745]  Globalists are plotting their very survival, as they said in every globalist publication.
[00:37:23.285 --> 00:37:25.247]  Our world government is in crisis.
[00:37:25.347 --> 00:37:30.110]  Our planetary plan, we've been doing for 60 years, is going to fall if Donald Trump gets elected.
[00:37:30.751 --> 00:37:33.253]  After Brexit and Russia pulling out, this is a beautiful thing.
[00:37:34.513 --> 00:37:38.016]  Hey, the Russian agent, Trump, just got Ford to stay in the U.S.
[00:37:38.376 --> 00:37:43.620]  The Russian agent is trying to get Apple, and they're saying they're going to do it probably, back to the United States.
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:44.181]  It's factories.
[00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:46.110]  Oh, the iPhone will go up $5.
[00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:47.571]  Yeah, we'll actually have an economy.
[00:37:47.611 --> 00:37:47.931]  Big deal.
[00:37:50.571 --> 00:37:52.172]  Isn't that just amazing?
[00:37:52.332 --> 00:37:53.892]  Oh my gosh, the Russian agent.
[00:37:53.932 --> 00:37:55.893]  Boy, I would need more of these Russian agents then, don't I?
[00:37:56.413 --> 00:38:01.734]  The Russian agent just is moving to have the Attorney General be Senator Jeff Sessions, the total patriot.
[00:38:01.874 --> 00:38:04.515]  Oh my gosh, those dirty Rooskies again.
[00:38:06.015 --> 00:38:07.796]  Truth is, there was no Rooskies involved with Trump.
[00:38:08.656 --> 00:38:11.337]  Now everybody sees how ridiculous that whole thing was.
[00:38:12.418 --> 00:38:18.145]  No, it's the globalists shutting off our power, shutting off our coal plants, shutting off our factories, shutting off our steel mills by design.
[00:38:18.425 --> 00:38:19.947]  And Trump's just going to flip the switches.
[00:38:20.207 --> 00:38:24.232]  He's 62 days from office and already Apple's coming back.
[00:38:24.312 --> 00:38:25.873]  Ford's announced it's definitely staying.
[00:38:26.154 --> 00:38:28.056]  New factories are being announced all over the place.
[00:38:28.456 --> 00:38:29.117]  Power plants.
[00:38:29.978 --> 00:38:32.499]  Are now being told they can be turned back on, that are totally clean.
[00:38:32.919 --> 00:38:33.860]  Oh, they can now compete.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.340]  Oh, sorry General Electric!
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:37.781]  You thought you'd double and triple prices and you did?
[00:38:37.881 --> 00:38:41.863]  Your little honeymoon screwing everybody over is bye-bye!
[00:38:41.883 --> 00:38:49.606]  And then wait till people's power bill goes down.
[00:38:51.752 --> 00:38:53.113]  The evil city of Austin.
[00:38:53.133 --> 00:38:53.714]  People that run it.
[00:38:54.074 --> 00:38:55.055]  There's not real elections here.
[00:38:55.095 --> 00:38:56.816]  This place is not at real elections in decades.
[00:38:57.076 --> 00:38:59.719]  I've seen it certified at the state board level by complaints I filed.
[00:38:59.739 --> 00:39:00.839]  They admitted it, but still certified it.
[00:39:03.261 --> 00:39:04.843]  The city owned four power plants.
[00:39:05.043 --> 00:39:06.604]  One was old, should have shut it down.
[00:39:07.725 --> 00:39:08.426]  Three were new.
[00:39:10.694 --> 00:39:11.774]  And they shut them all down.
[00:39:11.854 --> 00:39:12.675]  Didn't even sell them.
[00:39:12.855 --> 00:39:13.895]  They said, no, we own them.
[00:39:14.035 --> 00:39:15.035]  We want to shut them down.
[00:39:15.736 --> 00:39:16.556]  One part is left.
[00:39:16.616 --> 00:39:19.877]  It's the giant Fayetteville plant, 50 something miles from Austin.
[00:39:20.357 --> 00:39:21.137]  It didn't shut off.
[00:39:21.677 --> 00:39:25.759]  One third of it's still on, but it supplies something like 10% of Houston's power.
[00:39:26.399 --> 00:39:30.260]  Austin owned the other plants there and just shut them off.
[00:39:31.237 --> 00:39:32.318]  They're just shut off.
[00:39:32.418 --> 00:39:35.940]  Gigantic, clean, modern, multi-billion dollar power plant.
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.221]  That's military sabotage!
[00:39:38.621 --> 00:39:39.622]  That's globalism!
[00:39:39.962 --> 00:39:41.343]  Hurting you and your family!
[00:39:41.623 --> 00:39:45.466]  And the evil, racist Donald Trump wants to turn it back on and give you cheap electricity.
[00:39:45.986 --> 00:39:47.607]  Oh, what a horrible man!
[00:39:48.567 --> 00:39:49.608]  Oh my gosh!
[00:39:49.668 --> 00:39:52.590]  And you see all these poor, disheveled, hopeless people.
[00:39:54.295 --> 00:40:07.637]  They can be black, they can be Hispanic, white, they all look stupid and panicked and scared and just running around like the government's their mommy and they're in a jail cell hoping a little window opens and a little plate of food comes in.
[00:40:10.138 --> 00:40:19.439]  In Venezuela, I remember hearing about this from a Venezuelan fellow who worked here in IT and then I later saw it in the news, they make you pray to Hugo Chavez for your school lunch in the morning.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.900]  They have you pray to Christ and no food comes.
[00:40:22.892 --> 00:40:25.093]  Then you pray to Chavez and milk and cereal comes.
[00:40:28.875 --> 00:40:30.056]  Talk about desperate.
[00:40:30.116 --> 00:40:31.056]  Talk about sad.
[00:40:31.637 --> 00:40:34.618]  Talk about unbelievably horrible.
[00:40:34.778 --> 00:40:39.001]  This is what we're entering into and America has been given a reprieve.
[00:40:40.001 --> 00:40:41.182]  All I care about is delivery.
[00:40:41.262 --> 00:40:42.843]  I don't care who he appoints or what he does.
[00:40:42.903 --> 00:40:43.383]  I've said that.
[00:40:44.003 --> 00:40:45.484]  There have been some indicators I don't like.
[00:40:45.584 --> 00:40:46.364]  Some things I do like.
[00:40:46.545 --> 00:40:47.265]  Look at Sessions.
[00:40:47.305 --> 00:40:48.165]  Look at Stephen Manning.
[00:40:48.426 --> 00:40:49.106]  This is beautiful.
[00:40:53.018 --> 00:40:54.558]  All right, I need to start getting into the news here.
[00:40:54.858 --> 00:41:00.179]  Just briefly, let me get into some of the most important and exciting news and information first.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.580]  The story's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:09.221]  It's got some very powerful videos that Paul Watson cut, breaking down the hypocrisy and the lies.
[00:41:09.681 --> 00:41:12.982]  The mainstream media fake news narrative is already beginning to collapse.
[00:41:13.762 --> 00:41:19.623]  Quantcast restores InfoWars' blacklist of fake news websites removed from Quantcast.
[00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:26.102]  They had accepted the Google Chrome that had loaded in a liberal social justice warrior.
[00:41:27.105 --> 00:41:32.506]  female professor who just, she's judge jury executioner, she just decides what's fake.
[00:41:32.526 --> 00:41:34.007]  Now she's God, like the Snopes lady.
[00:41:34.207 --> 00:41:36.187]  She has a cat, she lives in an apartment, that's fine.
[00:41:36.507 --> 00:41:38.988]  She is God, she arbitrates, Obamacare is free.
[00:41:39.348 --> 00:41:39.928]  Of course it isn't.
[00:41:40.288 --> 00:41:42.169]  There is no IRS mandate, of course there is.
[00:41:42.549 --> 00:41:44.109]  There is no death panel, of course there is.
[00:41:44.169 --> 00:41:46.970]  But listen, Snopes said it isn't there, okay?
[00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:48.170]  Alright, so there you go.
[00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:50.390]  And this lady said so, so yes ma'am.
[00:41:50.951 --> 00:41:52.011]  Yes ma'am.
[00:41:52.831 --> 00:41:53.932]  Boy, we're so fake.
[00:41:54.072 --> 00:41:56.053]  Oh, we said Donald Trump would win and the polls were fake.
[00:41:56.313 --> 00:41:58.013]  Of course, we didn't just think that.
[00:41:58.033 --> 00:41:58.974]  I had the inside intel.
[00:42:00.775 --> 00:42:01.935]  That's why Trump's like, it's rigged.
[00:42:02.255 --> 00:42:02.575]  It's rigged.
[00:42:02.595 --> 00:42:06.497]  They don't want to tell people we're way ahead in the internal polls because they would sound like a sore loser.
[00:42:07.238 --> 00:42:07.738]  But they knew.
[00:42:09.379 --> 00:42:16.722]  The media, from the New York Times, the Osberg Statement, Jones keeps claiming that, you know, the internal polls show he's really way ahead.
[00:42:20.418 --> 00:42:20.958]  Who was right?
[00:42:21.719 --> 00:42:23.520]  That's right, see, because we tell the truth here.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:25.661]  That's what we do.
[00:42:26.081 --> 00:42:28.903]  We don't sit around out to get people all day like you people.
[00:42:30.804 --> 00:42:44.331]  So, the mainstream media fake news narrative is already beginning to collapse after the author of a blacklist of fake news websites removed the list, because you can get sued for that, sweetheart, and Quantcast, recentinfowars.com, was ranking as the 126th
[00:42:46.681 --> 00:42:48.701]  That's not news site, folks, that's site period in the world.
[00:42:49.082 --> 00:42:50.502]  Most traffic website in the world.
[00:42:52.923 --> 00:42:57.344]  I'm just relishing the fact that we are kicking their butt up one side and down the other.
[00:42:58.104 --> 00:42:58.764]  Woo!
[00:43:02.405 --> 00:43:08.286]  I mean, when it comes to news, I think only the mighty Drudge Report, let's pull it up on Quantcast, like 98 or something, only Drudge is bigger.
[00:43:09.087 --> 00:43:10.827]  We are slaughtering them.
[00:43:12.705 --> 00:43:13.085]  Drudge is 102.
[00:43:13.666 --> 00:43:14.647]  It fluctuates back and forth.
[00:43:15.147 --> 00:43:16.748]  Just slaughtering them.
[00:43:17.889 --> 00:43:23.073]  By the way, the big news websites all have these weird little bots and stuff that republish their stuff and play games and manipulate.
[00:43:23.113 --> 00:43:23.434]  No, no, no.
[00:43:23.634 --> 00:43:24.595]  We don't have any of that on.
[00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:27.157]  We just bare knuckles annihilate them.
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:36.064]  And again, InfoWars is 20-something percent, depending on the day, of our reach.
[00:43:37.565 --> 00:43:39.347]  We have big algorithm systems in there.
[00:43:40.606 --> 00:43:44.129]  Computer models, Google, you name it, the war game it all.
[00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:48.372]  And when we really use that stuff, we just kind of go look at it and go, good God, look at that!
[00:43:49.153 --> 00:43:57.019]  Like Death Star level firepower just blowing the enemy to pieces and the enemy just hops up and down and goes, we're wearing fancy suits and we're at CNN!
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:05.446]  And then no one listens to them and they're just caught fake news, fake reporters, fake everything, just spewing disinfo, giving all the questions to Hillary beforehand.
[00:44:05.466 --> 00:44:07.368]  There's all sorts of evil activity.
[00:44:12.176 --> 00:44:12.856]  Just think about that.
[00:44:13.437 --> 00:44:14.657]  The mainstream media is fake news.
[00:44:15.017 --> 00:44:26.162]  Yesterday we reported how Quantcast had apparently delisted InfoWars.com at the same time that the mainstream media was circulating a list of fake news websites that included big conservative news outlets such as InfoWars and Breitbart.
[00:44:26.542 --> 00:44:32.924]  InfoWars has also been reinstated as Quantcast's list of top websites and has skyrocketed to 126 on the list.
[00:44:37.506 --> 00:44:39.607]  Now, before I go any further, I want to just make a point here.
[00:44:43.855 --> 00:44:47.477]  Normally, a news organization this big would bring in billions of dollars.
[00:44:48.238 --> 00:44:52.040]  I'm good at reaching people, thank God, because you spread the word, but I'm not good at making money.
[00:44:52.621 --> 00:44:55.102]  And we need to bring in a ton of money.
[00:44:55.223 --> 00:45:01.447]  I have the responsibility to hire four or five more reporters, camera people, editors, and other things we need.
[00:45:02.247 --> 00:45:04.388]  We are on a shoestring budget, comparatively.
[00:45:04.729 --> 00:45:07.350]  If I was in New York or someplace, I could have 15, 20 employees, not 60.
[00:45:08.482 --> 00:45:14.865]  But when I say employees, that's like janitorial stuff, accounting, customer service, our own warehouse for shipping.
[00:45:15.325 --> 00:45:18.366]  I mean, when you're talking about news folks, it's like 25 people total.
[00:45:18.886 --> 00:45:20.427]  We need 30, 40, 50 people.
[00:45:20.507 --> 00:45:24.929]  I mean, we've got the staff of a small town newspaper, and we are changing the world.
[00:45:24.969 --> 00:45:27.510]  But I don't have the big corporate sponsors.
[00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:28.470]  I sell products.
[00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:29.951]  That's how we fund ourselves.
[00:45:30.011 --> 00:45:33.312]  And I have this penchant for trying to give people good deals, because that's just how I am.
[00:45:35.546 --> 00:45:37.909]  $9.95 for the Trump is my President shirt, that includes shipping.
[00:45:37.949 --> 00:45:38.910]  We don't make any money on that.
[00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:42.513]  But it's so effective, people buy five times more if I sell it at cost.
[00:45:42.833 --> 00:45:44.815]  I just want to see Trump's my president everywhere.
[00:45:44.855 --> 00:45:50.620]  So see, to get the message out, I sabotage our overall capitalization.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:57.706]  So I'm just saying, there's nowhere you can spend money that will have a bigger effect than InfoWars.com or clicking on the ads on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:45:57.927 --> 00:45:58.847]  There is nowhere.
[00:45:59.758 --> 00:46:03.760]  So when you get Rainforester, you get, look how good our info is, look how effective and cutting edge.
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.881]  Try the nutraceuticals, try the supplements.
[00:46:06.861 --> 00:46:13.444]  We've got the very best heirloom non-GMO seed varieties, with 15, 14 different companies, at the lowest prices you're going to find out there.
[00:46:14.204 --> 00:46:20.287]  We've got a Made in America apparel, Infowarsstore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:46:20.707 --> 00:46:24.689]  And I want to thank you for what you've done so far, but it's time for
[00:46:26.599 --> 00:46:33.861]  Most of the people, I mean, we know, because again, it's all algorithms, that's how the internet works, that maybe 4% of the folks that come through ever buy anything.
[00:46:34.401 --> 00:46:40.143]  If 10% bought something, we could double in size, triple in size, and I am committed to go all the way.
[00:46:41.363 --> 00:46:47.045]  We could do so much more if we have a Washington Bureau that's permanent and are in New York.
[00:46:47.085 --> 00:46:48.126]  We already have folks in London.
[00:46:48.166 --> 00:46:55.868]  I'd like to expand and actually set an office up in London and have Paul launch a whole TV operation there, still a small operation, but very effective.
[00:46:58.291 --> 00:47:00.252]  I don't want to grow, but it's our responsibility.
[00:47:01.393 --> 00:47:04.355]  I'm not going to sit here and have half measures with the enemy.
[00:47:04.395 --> 00:47:05.816]  I'm not risking my life to play games.
[00:47:05.956 --> 00:47:12.300]  I want to press the issue and run them to ground and then give them no quarter politically and strafe them into oblivion.
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:19.364]  And we can do that if we keep our eye on the prize and have the eye of the tiger and are savage in this fight.
[00:47:21.274 --> 00:47:26.490]  Now we have Brain Force Plus in, now with 20% more capsules, and it's got an even stronger formula.
[00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:27.131]  It's been tweaked.
[00:47:29.431 --> 00:47:33.354]  Brain Force Plus, an amazing nootropic, now back in stock.
[00:47:33.434 --> 00:47:36.757]  Infowarslife.com takes you right to the subpage that has all of our supplements.
[00:47:36.817 --> 00:47:41.061]  Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:47:41.581 --> 00:47:49.908]  Also, the great Longevity line of supplements, when you purchase it at Infowarsteam.com, you can sign up to be a distributor and get big discounts.
[00:47:49.928 --> 00:47:52.290]  You can also get free shipping when you sign up for auto ship there.
[00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:54.091]  Infowarsteam.com.
[00:47:56.093 --> 00:48:00.555]  And roughly, I don't know, six, seven, eight percent of that purchase goes to fund our operation as well.
[00:48:00.895 --> 00:48:06.317]  When you get high-quality nutraceuticals and supplements at InfoWarsTeam.com.
[00:48:06.718 --> 00:48:08.438]  That's InfoWarsTeam.com.
[00:48:08.978 --> 00:48:11.199]  I want to thank everybody for your support there as well.
[00:48:11.239 --> 00:48:16.182]  You can also call toll-free, and the number is there on the website at the top of the site.
[00:48:16.222 --> 00:48:23.445]  Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, Osseo FX, Rebound, and so much more at InfoWarsTeam.com.
[00:48:25.418 --> 00:48:31.284]  It's really InfoWarsHealth, but I haven't updated that website yet, so just go to InfoWarsTeam.com.
[00:48:31.985 --> 00:48:38.031]  Now, expanding on that, we have PrisonPlanet.tv that has the nightly news for subscribers.
[00:48:38.051 --> 00:48:39.372]  I want to thank all those old subscribers.
[00:48:40.613 --> 00:48:41.835]  20 people can use each membership there.
[00:48:43.146 --> 00:48:52.698]  Also, we have the new app that's $4.95 a month that we are now uploading special, exclusive, behind-the-scenes videos, live videos, special documentaries, you name it.
[00:48:53.078 --> 00:48:58.264]  There's now over 100 pieces of new original content there, but the real reason to have it is that there are discounts.
[00:48:58.965 --> 00:49:03.547]  Of up to 50 percent, the biggest sales we have are exclusive to members of the app.
[00:49:03.568 --> 00:49:09.431]  There's a free version, InfoWars.com forward slash app, that has a daytime video feed, audio feeds, podcasts, news articles, you name it.
[00:49:09.691 --> 00:49:18.335]  But the paid one has the live feeds, the archives, the discounts, and news alerts that we send to you that we're about to start.
[00:49:18.896 --> 00:49:21.737]  We're still tweaking a few things, but I'd say it's running about 98 percent.
[00:49:22.177 --> 00:49:24.579]  So InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:49:25.535 --> 00:49:31.538]  Also, it's key if they start censoring more, you never know what they could do, set off a nuke, Lord knows what, and InfoWars will be gone overnight.
[00:49:31.918 --> 00:49:40.262]  Only a fraction of the folks that are listeners have ever gone to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and signed up for our free email newsletter that has exclusive videos, articles.
[00:49:40.962 --> 00:49:41.662]  We're good to go.
[00:50:06.151 --> 00:50:08.194]  We'd have tens of millions of folks signed up if I'd have just done it.
[00:50:08.455 --> 00:50:13.321]  Only started in the last few years promoting it, and hundreds of thousands of people have come and signed up, but it's just a fraction.
[00:50:13.942 --> 00:50:17.026]  Only, you know, 400,000 people or whatever have downloaded the free app.
[00:50:17.046 --> 00:50:17.527]  I mean, you know.
[00:50:18.407 --> 00:50:21.108]  We're 126 on the internet, just on our website.
[00:50:21.608 --> 00:50:27.710]  We've had 5 million views conservatively on YouTube, and all we can get is 400,000 people to download the free app.
[00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:29.690]  I mean, I'm not bitching, but Drudge is right.
[00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:33.691]  We have to have our own platform separate from them that aren't as easy to censor.
[00:50:34.371 --> 00:50:38.072]  I mean, you know, they censor us, we point it out, you point it out, they back off.
[00:50:38.092 --> 00:50:40.553]  But they keep coming back, which is a tactic.
[00:50:40.593 --> 00:50:41.633]  So it's an internal battle.
[00:50:42.754 --> 00:50:44.214]  Bottom line, thank you all for your support.
[00:50:44.294 --> 00:50:45.274]  You are the info war.
[00:50:45.594 --> 00:50:46.275]  That's not rhetoric.
[00:50:46.335 --> 00:50:46.815]  It's true.
[00:50:46.895 --> 00:50:47.495]  You did this.
[00:50:48.814 --> 00:50:50.855]  I'm not gonna sit here and take it anymore!
[00:51:17.688 --> 00:51:20.391]  I don't care if he has goblin guides to go into Washington.
[00:51:20.711 --> 00:51:22.393]  I don't care if he gets goblin guts on him.
[00:51:23.194 --> 00:51:27.840]  But if he catches kissing goblins, or in bed with a goblin, that's a problem.
[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:29.061]  Or what if he marries a goblin?
[00:51:29.081 --> 00:51:30.583]  What if he has babies with a goblin?
[00:51:30.623 --> 00:51:32.265]  I mean, that would be what Hillary did.
[00:51:34.406 --> 00:51:35.546]  No, I mean, that's the point.
[00:51:35.586 --> 00:51:40.008]  He's gonna be around a lot of goblins, but he just has to avoid becoming a goblin himself.
[00:51:40.408 --> 00:51:52.092]  The contract with America that Trump posted, you know, before the election, before the process even took place, most of the things in that contract for America can't even begin to take place until he actually takes office.
[00:51:52.592 --> 00:51:53.673]  So, for now, what is it?
[00:51:53.713 --> 00:51:56.674]  Less than a week after he's actually president-elect.
[00:51:57.174 --> 00:52:00.835]  For people to be saying that he's backtracking on everything he said is ridiculous.
[00:52:01.255 --> 00:52:13.485]  Of course the language is going to be more conciliatory than it was in the lead up to the election because you've got thousands of maniacal Hillary supporters out on the streets rioting and attacking people.
[00:52:13.825 --> 00:52:18.008]  The empowered alt-right trolls have created a cesspit on Twitter.
[00:52:18.628 --> 00:52:18.969]  Oh really?
[00:52:18.989 --> 00:52:24.433]  That's funny because whenever I go on Twitter it's leftists threatening to assassinate Donald Trump.
[00:52:25.013 --> 00:52:26.634]  We've posted those tweets many times.
[00:52:26.975 --> 00:52:30.937]  In fact, I've just made a video, which is literally six minutes solid.
[00:52:31.398 --> 00:52:37.241]  Most of it is death threats posted by leftists on Twitter, threatening to assassinate Donald Trump.
[00:52:37.722 --> 00:52:54.293]  So the only people, yeah, you can have racists in the alt-right, but the only people who've actually made Twitter a cesspit, and in fact now Twitter has increased its censorship because of that, the only people who have made Twitter a cesspit is leftists with their violent, hateful, racist threats, which they now specialize in.
[00:52:55.053 --> 00:52:58.656]  But this was the original quote on this, um, Mashable article.
[00:52:59.377 --> 00:53:10.146]  They said, Paul Joseph Watson, the editor-at-large of conspiracy theorist website InfoWars, who has a Twitter following of 345,000 users, it's actually 357,000, he can't even count.
[00:53:10.466 --> 00:53:13.869]  This idiot who wrote this article, what's his name?
[00:53:14.109 --> 00:53:14.750]  Let's get his name.
[00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:18.053]  Colin Dalyder, can't even count for one.
[00:53:19.014 --> 00:53:25.502]  He has a Twitter following of wrong amount of Twitter users, advocated for mass murder in the aftermath of the election.
[00:53:25.862 --> 00:53:33.792]  His proof that I advocated for mass murder was me posting a tweet by somebody else who was concerned about mass murder.
[00:53:34.353 --> 00:53:35.895]  I said, look, this is silly.
[00:53:36.515 --> 00:53:38.636]  Donald Trump is going to gas disabled people.
[00:53:39.156 --> 00:53:40.276]  Obviously, a joke.
[00:53:40.636 --> 00:53:42.917]  He's not going to gas disabled people.
[00:53:42.937 --> 00:53:46.598]  The original tweet was a concern against mass murder.
[00:53:47.158 --> 00:53:52.799]  Yet they used it to say that I was encouraging, I was advocating mass murder.
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:55.200]  This is why no one trusts the mainstream media.
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:56.480]  This is why you've lost.
[00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:58.261]  This is why your narrative is failing.
[00:53:58.521 --> 00:54:02.282]  This is why you're going out of business because you lie, you deceive.
[00:54:12.492 --> 00:54:13.293]  We are back live.
[00:54:13.313 --> 00:54:15.417]  We've got a bunch of big guests joining us today.
[00:54:15.477 --> 00:54:20.465]  True heroes like James O'Keefe from Project Veritas and more.
[00:54:20.485 --> 00:54:21.387]  Dr. Steve Pachinik.
[00:54:22.757 --> 00:54:23.538]  Roger Stone.
[00:54:23.558 --> 00:54:24.418]  I talked to him last night.
[00:54:24.438 --> 00:54:24.959]  He wanted to come on.
[00:54:24.979 --> 00:54:25.259]  I don't know.
[00:54:25.279 --> 00:54:25.960]  That's been lined up.
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:28.261]  But we are working on it right now.
[00:54:28.281 --> 00:54:31.664]  Speaking of sponsors, it's not just the products we sell at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:54:31.704 --> 00:54:39.470]  It's the great folks like Chuck Andersees that put out the amazing film with Charlie Daniels, General Boykin, Joel Skousen, myself, and many others.
[00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:45.355]  It covers Agenda 21, the whole New World Order, the Federal Reserve, how evil it is, how it is a devilish system.
[00:54:45.835 --> 00:54:46.656]  Very powerful film.
[00:54:46.696 --> 00:54:47.576]  Everybody needs to see it.
[00:54:47.677 --> 00:54:47.957]  Visit.
[00:54:48.437 --> 00:54:53.301]  RevelationTheMovie.info to purchase the DVD or check into hosting in a theater near you.
[00:54:53.361 --> 00:54:57.243]  That's RevelationTheMovie.info and buy a couple copies.
[00:54:57.263 --> 00:54:58.945]  This guy put everything he had into this film.
[00:54:59.205 --> 00:55:02.667]  Took him five years to make it and it's just a very important film.
[00:55:02.707 --> 00:55:05.409]  Stone's on at 1230, so he's on about 40 minutes.
[00:55:05.449 --> 00:55:09.892]  So, RevelationTheMovie.info to purchase or to set up a screening in your area.
[00:55:09.912 --> 00:55:13.055]  That's what's really, really effective.
[00:55:14.076 --> 00:55:16.978]  Because don't think we can back off now that we're starting to turn the tide.
[00:55:17.018 --> 00:55:17.958]  The fight's just begun.
[00:55:18.138 --> 00:55:21.320]  We've got to intensify our operations, obviously.
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:27.963]  By the way, Daria, one of the producers, was pointing out, yeah, you're not bashing China enough.
[00:55:28.264 --> 00:55:34.427]  They loaded 70 million Americans' phones with spyware and stuff to basically steal your bank account information and rob you.
[00:55:36.138 --> 00:55:40.221]  I mean, folks, our military hardware, that came out ten years ago, they're doing that, or longer.
[00:55:41.101 --> 00:55:43.263]  China is literally all over us.
[00:55:43.683 --> 00:55:48.346]  Every movie I go see about science fiction or technology, China runs everything and is our boss.
[00:55:48.707 --> 00:55:49.147]  Every movie.
[00:55:49.527 --> 00:55:49.987]  Every movie.
[00:55:52.009 --> 00:55:52.669]  You'll notice it.
[00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:55.051]  I remember seeing this like five years ago.
[00:55:55.091 --> 00:55:56.072]  Now it's every movie.
[00:55:56.892 --> 00:55:58.213]  And now they announce China's taking over.
[00:55:58.613 --> 00:55:59.874]  That means communist Chinese.
[00:56:00.234 --> 00:56:02.736]  They're in the news saying, censor the internet in America.
[00:56:03.457 --> 00:56:05.118]  How about you go to hell, okay?
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:17.792]  I had China, Paul doesn't want me to get into it, but Paul had China basically come out and mess with him in London three years ago.
[00:56:19.674 --> 00:56:22.337]  Oh yeah, folks, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:56:22.357 --> 00:56:24.079]  We're talking James Bond movie stuff.
[00:56:26.744 --> 00:56:29.788]  Understand, folks, believe me, there's a lot more going on you don't know about.
[00:56:30.129 --> 00:56:32.932]  This country is under full-scale attack.
[00:56:33.513 --> 00:56:36.297]  The people we've got in aren't perfect, but they are not out to get the nation.
[00:56:36.317 --> 00:56:36.897]  Do you understand?
[00:56:37.158 --> 00:56:39.320]  And people better decide which side they're on right now.
[00:56:40.101 --> 00:56:41.663]  The Russians aren't doing anything.
[00:56:41.944 --> 00:56:43.246]  They're seen as destabilized.
[00:56:43.286 --> 00:56:44.547]  The globals are trying to bring them down.
[00:56:45.188 --> 00:56:46.048]  Just like they're bringing us down.
[00:56:46.068 --> 00:56:47.129]  I'm going to say it very slowly.
[00:56:47.389 --> 00:56:50.771]  The globalists are allied with China against the United States and Russia.
[00:56:51.251 --> 00:56:53.612]  The EU is meant to destroy Europe and suck it down.
[00:56:53.992 --> 00:56:55.413]  It wants to destroy the third world.
[00:56:55.613 --> 00:56:57.154]  The globalists are against humanity.
[00:56:57.374 --> 00:57:01.016]  It's a scientific system that de-industrializes you.
[00:57:01.396 --> 00:57:02.697]  I'll use the oblivion analogy.
[00:57:02.917 --> 00:57:08.540]  It's like a big alien spaceship that lands and sucks up your oceans, kills your planet and leaves, okay?
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:13.042]  It's cold-blooded, it's scientific, it's psychopathic, it's the enemy.
[00:57:14.414 --> 00:57:18.217]  You better understand the real system in the world, and I know you know that.
[00:57:18.257 --> 00:57:19.037]  I haven't gotten to it yet.
[00:57:19.077 --> 00:57:20.098]  I'll cover it in the next five minutes.
[00:57:21.739 --> 00:57:22.820]  I don't want to bash Muslims.
[00:57:24.661 --> 00:57:26.582]  I don't want to bash the Communist Chinese, but they're horrible.
[00:57:27.143 --> 00:57:28.183]  They're out of control, folks.
[00:57:28.203 --> 00:57:33.827]  I mean, you know, it's like saying I don't want to bash Germans in World War II, but they had a bad leadership and a bad culture at that time.
[00:57:34.488 --> 00:57:35.769]  I'm going to say the Nazis were bad.
[00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:39.171]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:57:41.423 --> 00:57:44.964]  Most of these Muslim countries, women are kept as basically property.
[00:57:45.184 --> 00:57:47.725]  And then the left has this fetish about Islam all day.
[00:57:48.985 --> 00:57:55.727]  British woman, gang-raped in Dubai, says, I'm petrified out here alone after she's arrested for extramarital sex.
[00:57:55.767 --> 00:57:57.208]  She goes and complains she's raped.
[00:57:57.728 --> 00:57:59.228]  And they go, sweetheart, there ain't no such thing.
[00:57:59.468 --> 00:58:01.389]  You're not... a man can do whatever he wants with you.
[00:58:03.970 --> 00:58:04.110]  So...
[00:58:05.657 --> 00:58:06.217]  There's another one.
[00:58:06.257 --> 00:58:06.937]  Shock video.
[00:58:06.977 --> 00:58:10.639]  Police force 80-year-old Italian hotel owner to house African migrants.
[00:58:10.679 --> 00:58:12.179]  This is just commandeering.
[00:58:12.599 --> 00:58:14.660]  It's just this little bitty Ian with this little old man.
[00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:18.081]  And the police just show up and say, you're gonna house North Africans.
[00:58:20.882 --> 00:58:24.123]  In Germany, they tell people, we're moving people into your house.
[00:58:24.203 --> 00:58:26.244]  I mean, this is incredible, folks.
[00:58:27.816 --> 00:58:31.978]  And the government, the Pope says, come, come, but he's got 200 foot walls, and then it gets worse.
[00:58:32.559 --> 00:58:37.281]  Video shows migrant in Italy washing his anus in public and then licking his hand.
[00:58:39.622 --> 00:58:41.043]  This is cultural enrichment, folks.
[00:58:41.323 --> 00:58:45.566]  They get in the pool and just start crapping everywhere, just shooting feces everywhere.
[00:58:45.966 --> 00:58:47.767]  And then everyone just, enrichment, enrichment!
[00:58:47.787 --> 00:58:49.068]  They rape children in the pools.
[00:58:49.388 --> 00:58:50.328]  I mean, my God.
[00:58:50.428 --> 00:58:51.209]  And the inbreeding.
[00:58:51.369 --> 00:58:52.289]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:52.329 --> 00:58:54.530]  It's hillbilly Muslims, folks, I'm telling you right now.
[00:58:54.571 --> 00:58:54.971]  We'll be back.
[00:58:55.051 --> 00:58:57.032]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:01.522 --> 00:59:06.223]  Donald Trump is moving fast to build his new administration, making many key appointments thus far.
[00:59:06.583 --> 00:59:09.144]  President-elect Trump has named the following appointments.
[00:59:09.764 --> 00:59:12.764]  Senator from Alabama, Jeff Sessions, Attorney General.
[00:59:13.125 --> 00:59:16.525]  Representative from Kansas, Mike Pompeo, Head of CIA.
[00:59:16.905 --> 00:59:20.986]  Former Military Intelligence Chief, Michael Flynn, National Security Advisor.
[00:59:21.346 --> 00:59:24.207]  Media Executive, Stephen Bannon, Chief Strategist.
[00:59:24.547 --> 00:59:28.528]  Chairman, Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus, White House Chief of Staff.
[00:59:29.068 --> 00:59:35.053]  Trump has also created a short list of possible appointees for other key spots, including a new Supreme Court Justice.
[00:59:35.494 --> 00:59:47.164]  Rumors are swirling that there may be a position for his campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, former mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, and even detractor Mitt Romney is being tossed around as a possible Secretary of State.
[00:59:47.564 --> 00:59:52.169]  While former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has said he will not be in a Trump administration.
[00:59:52.749 --> 00:59:53.470]  I'm Owen Schroer.
[00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:55.371]  For more, go to InfoWars.com.
[01:00:02.303 --> 01:00:04.916]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:25.815]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:26.776 --> 01:00:28.217]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:28.457 --> 01:00:29.598]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:30.138 --> 01:00:35.902]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:38.124 --> 01:00:44.449]  All the Japanese government came to see President-elect Trump, and how dare him have his daughter there to charm everyone?
[01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:46.871]  It's so horrible.
[01:00:47.751 --> 01:00:48.512]  Japanese loved it.
[01:00:49.881 --> 01:00:53.323]  Yeah, these are really concerned about China as well, so Trump knows who to meet with first.
[01:00:54.163 --> 01:00:55.464]  A lot of good things happening.
[01:00:55.524 --> 01:00:58.166]  It's good to have somebody that's not out to get the country in office, isn't it?
[01:00:58.988 --> 01:01:00.109]  A lot of people say, what are you going to do now?
[01:01:00.129 --> 01:01:01.470]  You're the one always on the outside bitching.
[01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:03.471]  We've still got all the globalists to fight.
[01:01:03.971 --> 01:01:11.496]  But if we ever turn things around really good, I'd be like, let's, you know, deliver food aid to the third world or let's try to, you know, I mean, I already fund with charities.
[01:01:11.536 --> 01:01:19.160]  I don't have a lot of money, but I pay for wells in Africa and wells in places like Paraguay and the CAF program.
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:21.001]  I've been involved with that with my grandmother for a long time.
[01:01:22.302 --> 01:01:22.863]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:01:22.903 --> 01:01:23.403]  I think I gave
[01:01:25.748 --> 01:01:28.371]  Just $10,000 for cows for Africans last year.
[01:01:28.391 --> 01:01:29.393]  I'll never talk about that stuff.
[01:01:29.413 --> 01:01:30.374]  I'm just going to brag about it.
[01:01:30.394 --> 01:01:31.295]  But you can really help somebody.
[01:01:31.735 --> 01:01:33.197]  Paying for a wind turbine in a village.
[01:01:33.838 --> 01:01:35.200]  Paying for wells in a village.
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:38.824]  Paying for, by the whole village, you know, a couple calves apiece.
[01:01:39.741 --> 01:01:40.661]  That's the kind of stuff I do.
[01:01:41.041 --> 01:01:41.721]  It's really cheap.
[01:01:42.102 --> 01:01:43.102]  Some good programs out there.
[01:01:43.462 --> 01:01:45.362]  And it's because I want to help humanity.
[01:01:45.582 --> 01:01:47.623]  I want that spirit to grow where people don't want to help me.
[01:01:48.363 --> 01:01:51.464]  And then to be called racist, I'm just done.
[01:01:52.024 --> 01:01:53.464]  Meanwhile, look at the Middle East, folks.
[01:01:53.964 --> 01:01:56.465]  I mean, it's some of the most backwards areas in the world.
[01:01:56.525 --> 01:02:02.066]  And our government, under Obama and Hitlery, went in and blew up any of the real progressives.
[01:02:02.106 --> 01:02:03.967]  Gaddafi was building up all of North Africa.
[01:02:04.901 --> 01:02:09.404]  He was building huge aquifer facilities, runways, businesses.
[01:02:09.424 --> 01:02:13.026]  60% of graduates from school were women.
[01:02:13.106 --> 01:02:14.147]  Christians were left alone.
[01:02:14.647 --> 01:02:15.068]  All over.
[01:02:15.708 --> 01:02:16.849]  Jihadis now run Libya.
[01:02:16.869 --> 01:02:17.609]  It's a failed state.
[01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:24.794]  And then meanwhile, British woman gang-raped in Dubai says, I'm petrified out here alone after she's arrested for extramarital sex.
[01:02:24.834 --> 01:02:25.374]  That's the mirror.
[01:02:26.695 --> 01:02:31.118]  Jane Mosey, 25, has spoken about her nightmare.
[01:02:32.011 --> 01:02:38.312]  She got raped, talked about it, and then they arrested her for the men raping her.
[01:02:40.073 --> 01:02:40.753]  And that's liberal!
[01:02:40.793 --> 01:02:44.093]  But oh my gosh, I'm a misogynist white male out to get women!
[01:02:44.133 --> 01:02:45.033]  Hey, dumbasses!
[01:02:45.234 --> 01:02:47.954]  The West is where women got their liberation, dumbasses!
[01:02:49.434 --> 01:02:50.394]  That's the thing about the left.
[01:02:50.434 --> 01:02:51.075]  They're not the left.
[01:02:51.115 --> 01:02:52.135]  They're such scum.
[01:02:52.635 --> 01:02:55.555]  They run around inverting reality, and I'm tired of it.
[01:02:56.896 --> 01:02:57.936]  I love when they try to guilt me.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:04.063]  I told you about, not this Halloween because I'm not doing anything this Halloween, but I had an office party the Halloween before and we were in a couple of different places.
[01:03:04.423 --> 01:03:07.044]  I had three different people come over and say, are you a Nazi?
[01:03:07.765 --> 01:03:12.307]  Because I was wearing an airline captain hat and a black shirt and purple pants.
[01:03:13.368 --> 01:03:19.131]  And when I wouldn't kiss their ass, they'd get in my face and I'd say, listen, you're just a mental patient wanting to control my life, you little freak.
[01:03:20.774 --> 01:03:21.816]  Let's go to the next one here.
[01:03:22.097 --> 01:03:22.718]  Shock video.
[01:03:22.738 --> 01:03:23.900]  Let's roll this for TV viewers.
[01:03:24.141 --> 01:03:25.283]  Stuff on Infowars.com.
[01:03:25.303 --> 01:03:26.105]  Paul Watson article.
[01:03:26.425 --> 01:03:31.014]  Police force 80-year-old Italian hotel owner to house African migrants.
[01:03:31.054 --> 01:03:31.736]  And I showed this.
[01:03:32.457 --> 01:03:32.517]  Oh!
[01:03:33.766 --> 01:03:46.113]  You know, and they just come in and just fill up his little bitty inn and his little bitty restaurant, and the police just show up and say, you're going to take care of these people, and by the way, you're going to do it for free.
[01:03:46.853 --> 01:03:47.974]  And people say, oh, well, don't be racist.
[01:03:48.234 --> 01:03:52.716]  Can I go to Africa and do this?
[01:03:52.756 --> 01:03:55.518]  Are these cops taking people into their houses?
[01:03:55.558 --> 01:03:59.200]  Hell no, they've got their big fancy Italian uniforms that look so good.
[01:04:01.067 --> 01:04:03.228]  They always pick some little sad man to do it to.
[01:04:03.268 --> 01:04:03.989]  Same thing in Germany.
[01:04:04.269 --> 01:04:04.909]  This is Merkel.
[01:04:04.969 --> 01:04:06.270]  Come here, come here, come here.
[01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:07.951]  Meanwhile, let's play this video out of Italy.
[01:04:08.091 --> 01:04:09.492]  This is what you see when you're in Italy, folks.
[01:04:11.773 --> 01:04:14.135]  And the gypsies walk up to you like they want to kill you with hate.
[01:04:14.155 --> 01:04:16.857]  You're supposed to go, oh, I'm liberal, slit my throat, you're so trendy.
[01:04:18.037 --> 01:04:22.800]  A video shows migrant, let's roll it, in Italy, washing his anus at a public fountain.
[01:04:23.601 --> 01:04:25.542]  Cultural enrichment at its best.
[01:04:26.022 --> 01:04:28.864]  And then he wipes his ass with the same hand and then drinks it.
[01:04:30.914 --> 01:04:31.754]  Oh yeah, this is genius.
[01:04:32.075 --> 01:04:36.597]  And now we've got cholera, and plague, and... Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:04:37.257 --> 01:04:39.098]  Leprosy's made a comeback in Europe and here.
[01:04:39.518 --> 01:04:40.398]  Wonderful!
[01:04:40.798 --> 01:04:41.739]  Wonderful!
[01:04:41.979 --> 01:04:43.960]  Don't even teach him how to use a toilet.
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:45.381]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:04:45.401 --> 01:04:46.681]  Don't even test people at the border.
[01:04:47.001 --> 01:04:51.643]  The Pope said bring them, but never at his little degenerate command base.
[01:04:51.683 --> 01:04:52.704]  They're at the Vatican.
[01:04:52.724 --> 01:04:54.845]  They're at the pedophile command base.
[01:04:56.027 --> 01:04:58.091]  I guess kind of WikiLeaks showed New York's kind of that too.
[01:04:58.272 --> 01:04:59.995]  There's many pedophile capitals, I mean.
[01:05:01.017 --> 01:05:05.446]  All right, more true, accurate, hardcore news straight ahead.
[01:05:06.088 --> 01:05:07.370]  Unabashed, unapologetic.
[01:05:18.146 --> 01:05:22.929]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[01:05:23.609 --> 01:05:25.190]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:30.573]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[01:05:30.933 --> 01:05:36.377]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[01:05:36.777 --> 01:05:43.361]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[01:05:44.021 --> 01:05:45.142]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[01:05:46.002 --> 01:05:47.943]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[01:05:48.283 --> 01:05:51.225]  But most people are just efficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[01:05:51.665 --> 01:05:55.287]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[01:05:55.467 --> 01:05:58.028]  It is the base to so many things.
[01:05:58.088 --> 01:06:10.435]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[01:06:10.655 --> 01:06:15.757]  Other iodine comes from the ocean, or from other byproducts of chemical facilities, and it's tainted.
[01:06:15.877 --> 01:06:17.218]  It's bound.
[01:06:17.278 --> 01:06:18.498]  It's not absorbable.
[01:06:18.918 --> 01:06:19.338]  I tried it.
[01:06:19.939 --> 01:06:23.480]  And I had incredible effects, even with dirty iodine, because the body needs it.
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:28.602]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[01:06:28.962 --> 01:06:32.684]  It's such a game changer, if you'll just research iodine for yourself.
[01:06:32.844 --> 01:06:35.405]  It's a fact that the federal government in the Midwest, back in the 20s,
[01:06:35.965 --> 01:06:44.951]  Mandated a grungier form of iodine to the salt because people had low IQs, they had huge goiters, major problems directly connected to it.
[01:06:45.111 --> 01:06:48.774]  There are some studies that show a 15 point increase, others show even higher.
[01:06:48.934 --> 01:07:02.383]  But it really is crazy to realize that this is something that is so deficient in our food chain, so deficient in our played out fields where different crops are being grown, but the federal government isn't educating people and telling them about it.
[01:07:02.583 --> 01:07:14.131]  That's why, for a limited time, I want to encourage everyone to go to Infowarslife.com and get 20% off on the best nascent iodine out there from our research, Truly Pure Survival Shield X2.
[01:07:14.371 --> 01:07:16.993]  Again, that's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[01:07:17.233 --> 01:07:20.175]  Thank you for joining us in this brief news update.
[01:07:20.576 --> 01:07:25.479]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[01:07:25.559 --> 01:07:26.720]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:29.462]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[01:07:29.602 --> 01:07:30.062]  I don't know.
[01:07:52.452 --> 01:07:55.075]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[01:07:55.095 --> 01:07:56.137]  You've got to have water to live.
[01:07:56.457 --> 01:07:57.178]  Iodine is key.
[01:07:57.218 --> 01:07:57.819]  You must have it.
[01:07:58.179 --> 01:08:05.728]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield niacin iodine, X2, at MFORWARRIORSLIFE.COM or call toll free.
[01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:06.629]  We can answer your questions.
[01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:06.689]  888-253-3139.
[01:08:24.199 --> 01:08:25.601]  We are on the march.
[01:08:26.021 --> 01:08:28.424]  The empire is on the run.
[01:08:29.164 --> 01:08:32.948]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:33.509 --> 01:08:40.496]  Well, Trump is still 62 days out from office to be number 45 President of the United States of America.
[01:08:41.557 --> 01:08:42.578]  Trump to be POTUS.
[01:08:43.706 --> 01:08:47.248]  And already Ford's announced it's not leaving with that SUV plant from Kentucky.
[01:08:47.808 --> 01:08:53.472]  Other major plants, I've got a list here, announcing they're going to stay in areas like Ohio and Texas as well.
[01:08:54.172 --> 01:09:00.576]  And Apple's announcing that they think they're going to move one of their big plants, making iPhones and other Apple products, back to the United States.
[01:09:01.376 --> 01:09:03.157]  They haven't manufactured here in 20 years.
[01:09:04.879 --> 01:09:06.199]  And he's not even in office yet.
[01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:08.401]  He has now announced that his Attorney General,
[01:09:09.266 --> 01:09:10.667]  Should he be confirmed by the Senate?
[01:09:11.328 --> 01:09:12.929]  Senator Jeff Sessions, that's gonna happen.
[01:09:13.769 --> 01:09:16.031]  Very honorable man, could not think of a better choice.
[01:09:16.712 --> 01:09:19.834]  That guy does not deal in politics when it comes to justice.
[01:09:20.515 --> 01:09:24.978]  People better look out, and let me tell you, Hillary is going to get in big trouble.
[01:09:25.358 --> 01:09:32.083]  Jeff Sessions never compromises, never backs down, and is one of the best people we've got in our government.
[01:09:32.123 --> 01:09:35.866]  So Trump is really delivering Stephen Bannon at the head of
[01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:41.631]  The entire strategy operation could not be a better choice.
[01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:44.253]  That's why they're calling him a racist and never showing any proof.
[01:09:44.593 --> 01:09:45.854]  They call James O'Keefe a racist.
[01:09:47.035 --> 01:09:48.256]  They call me one with no proof.
[01:09:48.296 --> 01:09:49.377]  It doesn't work anymore.
[01:09:49.437 --> 01:09:57.363]  But they've only tripled down, is the term, or maybe quintupled down, with all their lies and disinfo, what's going to happen?
[01:09:57.623 --> 01:09:58.724]  James O'Keefe joins us.
[01:09:59.605 --> 01:10:02.347]  He said, sure, I'll come on, but why?
[01:10:02.387 --> 01:10:04.168]  Well, I want a victory lap, but also
[01:10:05.109 --> 01:10:14.032]  Where you see all this going with your expertise, other goodies that are going to be coming out, because obviously we've got to hold our foot to the neck of these people.
[01:10:14.452 --> 01:10:21.954]  We may be a little bit euphoric, we're having some victories right now, but you better believe they're coming back with an incredible vengeance.
[01:10:21.994 --> 01:10:31.597]  So, the man that heads up Project Veritas, one of the undoubted MVPs, and look, it's not about credit, but we have to single out
[01:10:33.083 --> 01:10:34.270]  Who is the most effective?
[01:10:34.351 --> 01:10:35.418]  And it is James O'Keefe.
[01:10:36.644 --> 01:10:37.764]  It is Julian Assange.
[01:10:38.305 --> 01:10:39.165]  It is Matt Drudge.
[01:10:39.985 --> 01:10:41.286]  It is Donald Trump.
[01:10:42.546 --> 01:10:49.268]  I mean, these are the type of folks we need to celebrate, but also the listeners of this broadcast, and my crew, and just everybody in the Liberty Movement.
[01:10:49.849 --> 01:10:55.070]  It isn't about credit, but man, we've been the underdog for a long time, and Trump is really starting to deliver.
[01:10:55.090 --> 01:10:58.012]  Now, I haven't talked to O'Keefe since before the election.
[01:10:58.032 --> 01:10:59.052]  I don't know his view on all this.
[01:10:59.072 --> 01:11:01.073]  We'll see if he concurs or what he adds.
[01:11:01.113 --> 01:11:02.853]  ProjectVeritas.com.
[01:11:02.893 --> 01:11:04.774]  James, congratulations, my friend.
[01:11:06.001 --> 01:11:07.462]  Hey Alex, thank you so much.
[01:11:07.562 --> 01:11:19.228]  And just by way of introduction, I've had a chest cold the last few days after a week of adrenaline and unbelievable, amazing highs and amazing lows.
[01:11:19.888 --> 01:11:22.129]  I'm recovering here physically, so I apologize.
[01:11:22.169 --> 01:11:24.490]  I'm not 100 percent, but it's so great to be with you.
[01:11:25.331 --> 01:11:27.492]  Well, absolutely, my friend.
[01:11:27.532 --> 01:11:32.635]  I know I was exhausted for three or four days as well, kind of like dizzy, actually, but I'm now back to normal.
[01:11:32.975 --> 01:11:34.055]  Hopefully you get back soon.
[01:11:34.135 --> 01:11:35.016]  Where do you want to start?
[01:11:37.142 --> 01:11:46.288]  Well, I think that one of the things that Roger Stone and I discussed last time I was with you was the tipping point that we thought that we had not reached as a country.
[01:11:46.308 --> 01:11:54.553]  I think we are now beyond the tipping point where social media and the power of independent media is greater.
[01:11:54.573 --> 01:11:58.535]  It is greater than the mainstream media.
[01:11:58.575 --> 01:11:59.876]  We have reached that tipping point.
[01:12:00.356 --> 01:12:05.683]  We are at a point where the power of the media is now not what it once was.
[01:12:05.703 --> 01:12:14.193]  When I was at that election night, Hilton Hotel, and I saw the big lights and the hundreds of journalists, I could see them physically sobbing.
[01:12:14.354 --> 01:12:19.039]  I could see them crying because they had now realized that they had lost their power.
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:36.395]  And it was a very moving moment for me because I've spent the last eight years of my life fighting these people, tooth and nail, persevering over their firewall, breaking news on YouTube, even while these companies like YouTube and Facebook and Twitter try to shut us down.
[01:12:37.375 --> 01:12:46.804]  And to reach that climax where now we are now more powerful than they are, it was a very touching moment for me and it showed that
[01:12:47.524 --> 01:12:48.965]  The whole game has now changed.
[01:12:49.005 --> 01:12:54.068]  We are living in a new world where we are now more powerful than they are.
[01:12:54.668 --> 01:12:56.409]  And that's just the bottom line.
[01:12:56.509 --> 01:12:58.010]  And Trump has to realize that.
[01:12:58.030 --> 01:13:04.653]  And we did this, I'm not saying it's true, from the grassroots because we really believed in America, in free market, in the Second Amendment.
[01:13:04.734 --> 01:13:06.755]  They were trying to dominate us and studying history.
[01:13:07.575 --> 01:13:15.478]  And studying past wars, and this is a new type of war, an information war predominantly, you never know when an evil empire is about to break up.
[01:13:15.538 --> 01:13:16.898]  You never know when it's about to fall.
[01:13:16.978 --> 01:13:20.560]  It's going to tell you to the minute, you know, that the evil king kills over.
[01:13:21.385 --> 01:13:29.272]  That it's victorious, it's all-powerful, it's unstoppable, and this system was so delusional, they were believing their own BS.
[01:13:29.332 --> 01:13:39.521]  I mean, listen, when InfoWars.com, which is, most people are obsessed with their site, it's a small part of our overall reach, 23% according to the Google algorithm, on a daily basis it's 19%, 25%, but average is 23% year end.
[01:13:44.235 --> 01:13:46.858]  We're number 124 on the web, folks.
[01:13:47.278 --> 01:13:49.920]  We have reached 5 billion people on YouTube alone.
[01:13:51.121 --> 01:13:55.785]  And this just shows what InfoWars is doing, and we're not even getting started.
[01:13:56.306 --> 01:13:59.509]  Imagine how much that freaks them out, James O'Keefe.
[01:14:00.717 --> 01:14:16.075]  Yeah, I mean, when we were, I was on, I think, Tommy Loren's Facebook Livestream, and there were like 1.7 million people watching it, and CNN's Brian Stelter, this is a Reliable Sources, the show's called Reliable Sources, he tweets at me and he goes,
[01:14:16.696 --> 01:14:20.557]  You know, James, we got 1.2 million viewers on CNN.
[01:14:21.057 --> 01:14:25.698]  And I said, Brian, we got 20 million views on our YouTube channel in the last week.
[01:14:25.998 --> 01:14:27.799]  We got 100 million Twitter impressions.
[01:14:28.279 --> 01:14:32.440]  You know, nobody watches CNN except when you're in airports.
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:33.740]  They're delusional.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:34.260]  They are delusional.
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:37.641]  The bottom line is, Alex, is they realize they are losing their power.
[01:14:37.881 --> 01:14:38.221]  That's it.
[01:14:38.581 --> 01:14:47.764]  They're losing their control over the voter, and they're losing their power over the people, and they panic, and they get emotional, and when they get emotional, they make mistakes.
[01:14:48.064 --> 01:15:00.607]  And then when they make mistakes, they lose their credibility, and the audience, that is the American people, leave them, and they go to organizations like Infowars, and organizations like Project Veritas, and they go to where the action is, the excitement.
[01:15:00.667 --> 01:15:04.328]  And by the way, there's only six or seven networks and systems
[01:15:05.288 --> 01:15:12.491]  Their audience is so tiny now, even Fox is nothing compared to the independent media, but they're still so delusional, and nothing against Fox, but they just don't know it yet.
[01:15:12.511 --> 01:15:16.752]  And we're not bragging, we're just explaining folks the new media landscape for everybody.
[01:15:16.993 --> 01:15:21.554]  There are high school people and college kids that are getting 100 million views a month.
[01:15:21.794 --> 01:15:25.956]  There are hundreds of prominent people that have just suddenly popped up that are huge.
[01:15:26.096 --> 01:15:27.277]  I'm excited to see that.
[01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:30.318]  I mean, what's scary to the establishment is,
[01:15:32.219 --> 01:15:34.241]  We're not just getting the regular news audience.
[01:15:35.142 --> 01:15:40.366]  The Liberty Movement has expanded to where this is almost like a blood sport or a new form of entertainment.
[01:15:40.666 --> 01:15:49.094]  We're making politics fun again and I think that's where they lost the paradigm is the memes and all of it is what I'm getting at.
[01:15:50.421 --> 01:15:58.104]  Yeah, when we were, Alex, before, after I spoke to you last time on election day, we were in Philadelphia exposing voter fraud.
[01:15:58.504 --> 01:16:00.144]  And it was easy to expose.
[01:16:00.204 --> 01:16:10.748]  I mean, we released videos on election day in Philadelphia where we would go to the poll site and, you know, with a hidden camera, we'd go up to the supervisor, the judge, and they told us who to vote for.
[01:16:10.788 --> 01:16:11.508]  That's a crime.
[01:16:11.568 --> 01:16:12.508]  You can't do that.
[01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:13.869]  They were saying vote for Hillary.
[01:16:14.409 --> 01:16:15.770]  I mean, these are election judges.
[01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:20.553]  These are supposed to be making sure that these elections are conducted fairly and without bias.
[01:16:21.134 --> 01:16:32.181]  And as I was in my car, driving around Philadelphia with my team, going, frankly, some of us were risking our safety to do this because these were in neighborhoods where people were intimidating people.
[01:16:32.221 --> 01:16:33.742]  They wouldn't let you in as a journalist.
[01:16:34.142 --> 01:16:35.023]  We were going around.
[01:16:35.563 --> 01:16:38.585]  I was tweeting live streaming that I was doing this.
[01:16:38.665 --> 01:16:40.286]  I was monitoring fraud.
[01:16:40.306 --> 01:16:43.949]  And these journalists were attacking, I mean, viciously attacking us.
[01:16:44.409 --> 01:16:44.649]  I don't
[01:16:59.486 --> 01:17:00.106]  And I totally agree!
[01:17:27.637 --> 01:17:29.298]  James O'Keefe, here's the next question then.
[01:17:29.939 --> 01:17:31.039]  How do they strike back?
[01:17:31.099 --> 01:17:51.573]  Well, we've seen them with this delisting with Google Chrome and Quantcast, but one day after they did it, they relisted InfoWars and Breitbart and others, because everybody looked at it and said, some professor just declares she's God and says what's real and what isn't, after this entire mainstream media got caught faking polls, faking election results,
[01:17:52.433 --> 01:17:55.074]  Giving the questions to Hillary, fake interviews.
[01:17:55.114 --> 01:17:58.735]  I mean, I've looked for names for the mainstream media all these years.
[01:17:58.775 --> 01:17:59.955]  They finally gave it to us.
[01:18:00.295 --> 01:18:02.016]  They're the fake media.
[01:18:02.856 --> 01:18:06.597]  By them calling us that, I finally realized that's really their name, don't you think?
[01:18:07.977 --> 01:18:09.938]  I think you have to, yeah, yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:18:09.958 --> 01:18:11.018]  I'm looking at the same thing.
[01:18:11.638 --> 01:18:16.480]  That fake list of fake news sites where they, where we made a list of fake news sites.
[01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:17.900]  Oh, you were on there too, absolutely.
[01:18:18.496 --> 01:18:19.096]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:19.156 --> 01:18:20.717]  So, I mean, listen, this is what I would say to that.
[01:18:21.078 --> 01:18:25.801]  Judge a man by his work product, not by the name you used to describe him.
[01:18:25.881 --> 01:18:32.345]  They're obsessed with titles, and do you call you an activist or a criminal or a fake or a hoaxer?
[01:18:32.765 --> 01:18:34.726]  Judge someone by what they do.
[01:18:35.167 --> 01:18:38.669]  Judge Veritas, our organization, by what we express.
[01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:57.318]  You guys are so clean, and so good, and so hardworking, and so dedicated, and so classical journalism, and then they go, oh, he's a convicted criminal, not saying, he went in a federal building, a public building, to show that their phones weren't broken, and I mean, oh my god, oh my gosh, I mean...
[01:18:58.218 --> 01:19:01.042]  Bob Kramer was actually a convicted felon.
[01:19:01.142 --> 01:19:08.011]  Even Anderson Cooper on CNN struggled with attacking me for being a criminal because they're trying to defend actual convicted felons that we're exposing.
[01:19:08.371 --> 01:19:09.753]  But this is the bottom line.
[01:19:10.213 --> 01:19:12.356]  Your question was, where do we go from here?
[01:19:12.857 --> 01:19:15.380]  And my answer is, you do the job for them.
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:16.120]  You do the job!
[01:19:32.731 --> 01:19:32.831]  Yes.
[01:19:49.782 --> 01:19:51.664]  Go to where the actual journalists are.
[01:19:51.684 --> 01:19:52.104]  Exactly.
[01:19:52.144 --> 01:20:05.574]  So it's a total tipping point, except for the minority of people who are white, black, Hispanic, you name it, that really are anti-white, racist, butthurt weirdos like de Blasio with his crew.
[01:20:06.435 --> 01:20:07.216]  You know de Blasio.
[01:20:07.236 --> 01:20:07.796]  They're in New York.
[01:20:07.836 --> 01:20:09.397]  The mayor, Mikkel Thelen, has an article.
[01:20:09.437 --> 01:20:12.880]  Spokesman says sign was meant to protest white supremacy.
[01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:14.541]  It says F whiteness.
[01:20:15.422 --> 01:20:32.471]  Black Lives Matter with a bunch of weirdo, straight-laced, chicken-necked, neurotic white liberals running around bashing white people when the average white person I know is just a, you know, regular schmo like anybody else.
[01:20:32.891 --> 01:20:34.032]  I mean, what is this?
[01:20:34.792 --> 01:20:36.333]  It's really, these are sickening people.
[01:20:36.673 --> 01:20:40.295]  These are racist and I'm so tired of them.
[01:20:41.308 --> 01:20:52.495]  Well, we did a story on Election Day, the day before Election Day, we went into, in Mayor de Blasio's district, New York City, we went into the poll location of Huma Abedin, and we got offered her ballot.
[01:20:52.855 --> 01:21:04.963]  They handed us Huma Abedin's ballot, we had full burqa on, because the Elections Commissioner, we did another video, where the Elections Commissioner was saying that anybody can vote without an ID, there's so much fraud, we bust people around.
[01:21:05.363 --> 01:21:07.885]  So Mayor de Blasio fired, this is yesterday,
[01:21:08.325 --> 01:21:12.448]  He fired this elections commissioner we caught on tape for telling the truth.
[01:21:13.229 --> 01:21:14.730]  I think he should have been given a medal.
[01:21:14.810 --> 01:21:15.770]  He was being honest.
[01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:18.192]  He was forthcoming about the fraud.
[01:21:18.212 --> 01:21:23.756]  He was describing that they go to places like certain neighborhoods like Chinatown and they quote, bus people around to vote.
[01:21:24.036 --> 01:21:26.698]  They put them in a bus and they go from poll site to poll site.
[01:21:27.118 --> 01:21:32.322]  So Mayor de Blasio fired the elections commissioner for revealing the fraud.
[01:21:32.943 --> 01:21:35.384]  This is how corrupt Mayor de Blasio is.
[01:21:35.765 --> 01:21:36.165]  But listen,
[01:21:36.545 --> 01:21:38.447]  People, I can't say it enough.
[01:21:38.847 --> 01:21:40.768]  Just citizens have to do their job.
[01:21:40.808 --> 01:21:45.892]  Places like Reddit were crowdsourcing investigative journalism out during the last few weeks.
[01:21:46.333 --> 01:21:48.574]  They were looking through FEC disbursement forms.
[01:21:48.614 --> 01:21:53.418]  They were giving that to us while these journalists in their ivory towers were condemning us.
[01:21:53.438 --> 01:21:54.799]  There's that picture right now.
[01:21:54.839 --> 01:21:57.621]  de Blasio demands resignation of elections official.
[01:21:57.741 --> 01:22:04.347]  Who actually told the truth and said it's wrong that there's fraud and he wants to stop it and then he gets... How about de Blasio resigns?
[01:22:04.367 --> 01:22:05.928]  So let's expand on this briefly.
[01:22:06.997 --> 01:22:07.518]  I forgot that.
[01:22:07.918 --> 01:22:13.784]  It's beautiful how Reddit and all these other big sites are crowdsourcing the WikiLeaks, crowdsourcing election research.
[01:22:14.084 --> 01:22:14.865]  This is human.
[01:22:15.185 --> 01:22:19.029]  This is the people making it a game to fight corruption.
[01:22:19.389 --> 01:22:20.870]  That's what they've always been afraid of.
[01:22:20.971 --> 01:22:21.691]  It's fun.
[01:22:22.012 --> 01:22:24.294]  It's an animating contest that Jefferson talked about.
[01:22:25.543 --> 01:22:40.193]  Yeah, and one of the most enlightening moments of the last 45 days, when I was breaking these stories, and the Washington Post tweeted at me and said, why don't you actually show me a video of Obama meeting with these people?
[01:22:40.393 --> 01:22:41.234]  Show me the video!
[01:22:41.294 --> 01:22:45.016]  And I tweeted back and said, hey Dave, shouldn't that be your job?
[01:22:45.397 --> 01:22:47.698]  Isn't that your job at the Washington Post?
[01:22:48.399 --> 01:22:50.140]  They're totally reactive.
[01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:54.162]  You couldn't even break a Woodward and Bernstein style story these days.
[01:22:54.202 --> 01:22:58.304]  They're a bunch of white shoe arrogant Harvard snobs.
[01:22:59.365 --> 01:23:02.167]  They push classism and racism because that's who they are.
[01:23:02.607 --> 01:23:05.709]  We're just gutter brawling blue collar patriots.
[01:23:06.029 --> 01:23:07.510]  We're gonna kick their ass every time.
[01:23:08.612 --> 01:23:12.696]  Yes, and they're reactive, and they are reactive to what we do.
[01:23:12.836 --> 01:23:14.598]  That's the beautiful part.
[01:23:14.898 --> 01:23:17.541]  They're now talking about what we are talking about.
[01:23:17.621 --> 01:23:18.942]  We set the narrative now.
[01:23:19.303 --> 01:23:23.066]  Yes, they criticize us, they call us names, but they can name call all they want.
[01:23:23.106 --> 01:23:24.308]  Judge a man by his work.
[01:23:24.688 --> 01:23:28.071]  Oh, don't you love how they call us fake news and they call us alt-right?
[01:23:28.352 --> 01:23:28.772]  Exactly.
[01:23:28.812 --> 01:23:30.334]  We're not going by their labels anymore.
[01:23:31.288 --> 01:23:34.529]  What they said to Steve Bannon, they said, they called him a white supremacist.
[01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:35.610]  I mean, I know Steve Bannon.
[01:23:35.630 --> 01:23:37.051]  I've worked for Steve Bannon.
[01:23:37.251 --> 01:23:38.911]  He's not a white supremacist.
[01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:41.773]  He's a hardworking, he's a good businessman.
[01:23:42.413 --> 01:23:46.235]  Everyone at Breitbart News is, they're decent people.
[01:23:46.275 --> 01:23:47.075]  They have their views.
[01:23:47.495 --> 01:23:48.276]  But you know what I say?
[01:23:48.296 --> 01:23:52.578]  I say if the media wants to hashtag stop Bannon, they should endorse him.
[01:23:52.938 --> 01:23:57.320]  Because at this point, the people are going to do the exact opposite of whatever the media tells them to do.
[01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:58.961]  Bannon is a trailblazer.
[01:24:00.282 --> 01:24:03.926]  is a trailblazer and took Breitbart in the right direction and helped win this election.
[01:24:04.467 --> 01:24:09.153]  Again, America is about betting on the people that are trailblazers who do the right thing and win.
[01:24:09.473 --> 01:24:10.915]  These are winners we're talking about.
[01:24:12.824 --> 01:24:17.766]  Absolutely, and I think the media, people are now going to do the exact opposite of what the media tells them to do.
[01:24:17.806 --> 01:24:24.688]  The vaulted, as Brit Hume said, the vaulted power of the media is not what it once was.
[01:24:24.748 --> 01:24:29.030]  Their entire business model is based on credibility and relevance.
[01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:35.252]  And when they become irrelevant, when people don't trust them anymore, we're living in a new world.
[01:24:35.272 --> 01:24:36.733]  It really is historical.
[01:24:36.813 --> 01:24:39.574]  I can't, Alex, I can't emphasize just how big
[01:24:40.094 --> 01:24:44.177]  How game-changing, how transformative the last couple weeks are.
[01:24:44.217 --> 01:24:45.979]  And we are the tip of the spear, buddy.
[01:24:46.019 --> 01:24:47.740]  We are, we are it.
[01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:53.504]  I mean, this is, we are at the front lines of democracy, of information.
[01:24:53.525 --> 01:24:58.949]  We're on the front lines of the rebirth of our constitutional republic and the new renaissance, my friend.
[01:24:59.997 --> 01:25:15.865]  And when we get thousands of people every single day, and that is true, today we got hundreds of tips, and people say, come to my school board, come to my town council, come to my state office, and expose this quote-unquote law.
[01:25:15.885 --> 01:25:23.009]  And the secret is, you're going to expose a lot of it, but they're all copying Veritas in your book that lays out how to do it, and how to do it legally and lawfully, as investigative journalists.
[01:25:23.269 --> 01:25:25.490]  They're now all starting their own little town watches.
[01:25:25.850 --> 01:25:29.032]  And again, the return of America's here, it is horrifying them.
[01:25:30.356 --> 01:25:36.140]  Yes, it is horrifying them, but we have a responsibility to build a institution.
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.601]  You're right, people are going to do it on their own, and that's important.
[01:25:39.201 --> 01:25:45.045]  As long as it's legal... No, I'm saying they should go to you as well, but I'm just saying, don't wait for orders from headquarters, folks, just do it!
[01:25:46.343 --> 01:25:47.604]  Yeah, just go out and like Reddit.
[01:25:47.644 --> 01:25:49.065]  The Reddit community is a great example.
[01:25:49.085 --> 01:25:50.846]  These are people who crowdsourced it out.
[01:25:51.266 --> 01:25:56.610]  They went, they found Zulema Rodriguez was the protester who shut down the highway in Arizona during that video series.
[01:25:56.890 --> 01:26:00.172]  People found little video clips of her and they said, that's her, that's Zulema.
[01:26:00.472 --> 01:26:01.853]  She was paid by Hillary Clinton.
[01:26:02.254 --> 01:26:06.216]  So people are doing it themselves and it is a beautiful thing to watch.
[01:26:06.697 --> 01:26:14.142]  The normal people doing the job of NBC News while NBC News puts insurmountable obstacles in their path.
[01:26:14.642 --> 01:26:15.522]  It is moving towards
[01:26:16.323 --> 01:26:16.683]  Wow.
[01:26:16.783 --> 01:26:22.909]  James, I've been interviewing you probably eight, nine, ten years, whatever it is, and I tell you, you are on fire.
[01:26:22.929 --> 01:26:26.332]  I mean, even though you're under the weather, I've never heard you so excited.
[01:26:26.893 --> 01:26:38.724]  Is there a feeling, not of completion, but of satisfaction that, wow, we are on the right side of history, there is a God, we've had this great victory, we've got more work to do, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel.
[01:26:39.004 --> 01:26:40.206]  Sometimes the good guys win.
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:47.144]  Yeah, I don't know if you, you know, I myself am Catholic, so I'm a man of God.
[01:26:47.164 --> 01:26:52.307]  I believe that there is, it's satisfying, it's redemption.
[01:26:53.287 --> 01:27:03.974]  Being there that night, seeing this happen, I think we're given another chance as a country to, you know, Benjamin Franklin said, it's a republic if you can keep it right.
[01:27:03.994 --> 01:27:05.615]  You can feel the providence, can't you, in the air?
[01:27:06.681 --> 01:27:11.583]  I can feel, I can feel the Providence because there are too many, this investigation took us a year to do.
[01:27:11.883 --> 01:27:13.303]  Too many things could have gone wrong.
[01:27:13.363 --> 01:27:14.404]  It was so risky.
[01:27:14.424 --> 01:27:15.504]  It was so dangerous.
[01:27:15.524 --> 01:27:17.785]  I mean, we were invited to the White House.
[01:27:17.845 --> 01:27:18.825]  We could not go.
[01:27:18.845 --> 01:27:24.987]  It's the equivalent, to use a cheesy analogy, of like, you did five Death Star runs and every time you blew it up.
[01:27:25.107 --> 01:27:26.828]  I mean, it was just, all was incredible.
[01:27:27.725 --> 01:27:30.307]  Yes, so I think we've been given another chance.
[01:27:30.327 --> 01:27:39.634]  We have an opportunity here to reverse course, and I think the solutions are beyond the legislative process.
[01:27:39.674 --> 01:27:51.383]  I think it's going to require normal people doing extraordinary things, and to see the hundreds of thousands of people in this country take it upon themselves to do the job of the media, that to me shows us that there's much hope for the future.
[01:27:51.663 --> 01:27:54.245]  So it's redemption, it's satisfaction, and it's hope.
[01:27:55.006 --> 01:27:58.148]  And it's the fact that the battle's not won, even though we're starting to turn the tide.
[01:27:58.168 --> 01:27:59.048]  You know, I forget who said it.
[01:27:59.068 --> 01:27:59.809]  We can look it up.
[01:28:00.649 --> 01:28:04.471]  But they say that it is great times.
[01:28:04.691 --> 01:28:06.092]  It is tumultuous times.
[01:28:06.172 --> 01:28:10.214]  It is extraordinary times that make extraordinary men and women.
[01:28:10.234 --> 01:28:11.515]  And I think that's what we've seen here.
[01:28:12.516 --> 01:28:13.056]  Absolutely.
[01:28:13.456 --> 01:28:19.159]  In closing, Trump, Ford coming back, Apple saying they're going to look at coming back.
[01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:22.201]  It's crazy.
[01:28:22.441 --> 01:28:23.762]  I'm really worried they're going to try to kill him.
[01:28:25.765 --> 01:28:35.230]  Well, I mean, if there's ever a plot to do anything like that, my hope is that our cameras would be infiltrating conversations to that effect.
[01:28:35.370 --> 01:28:36.971]  Hell, they're all over the news saying kill him.
[01:28:37.391 --> 01:28:39.352]  Why aren't these people being arrested saying kill Trump?
[01:28:39.412 --> 01:28:40.973]  I'm going to kill Trump.
[01:28:41.373 --> 01:28:44.895]  They're on Twitter saying they want to kill both you, me, and Trump.
[01:28:45.315 --> 01:28:47.296]  And Jack Dorsey is not kicking them off.
[01:28:47.356 --> 01:28:51.758]  Recall that Twitter is now removing people on Twitter.
[01:28:51.798 --> 01:28:52.458]  They removed me.
[01:28:52.498 --> 01:28:53.399]  They reinstated me.
[01:28:53.879 --> 01:28:55.220]  James Wood has left Twitter?
[01:28:56.754 --> 01:28:57.114]  What's that?
[01:28:57.375 --> 01:28:58.915]  James Wood has had to leave Twitter.
[01:28:59.115 --> 01:29:01.817]  We also have Milo has been banned.
[01:29:01.877 --> 01:29:03.197]  I mean, it's horrible.
[01:29:04.098 --> 01:29:05.258]  There's a number of people that have left Twitter.
[01:29:05.279 --> 01:29:09.200]  They tried to ban me, but then 30,000 people sent emails to Twitter and they reinstated.
[01:29:09.661 --> 01:29:14.923]  So look, I can't reveal everything we're doing, but we're going to be on the front lines exposing all of this.
[01:29:15.604 --> 01:29:24.208]  And if there ever was a conspiracy to commit fraud, my hope is that our people would be embedded in there to catch them in the act.
[01:29:24.528 --> 01:29:25.289]  That's all I can say.
[01:29:26.129 --> 01:29:30.831]  If you're working in a big corporation and you see them colluding to suppress free speech and racketeer, record it.
[01:29:30.891 --> 01:29:31.672]  Send it to InfoWars.
[01:29:31.692 --> 01:29:32.552]  Send it to James O'Keefe.
[01:29:32.872 --> 01:29:33.333]  Put it out.
[01:29:33.713 --> 01:29:36.614]  James O'Keefe, thanks for spending time with us at ProjectVeritas.com.
[01:29:37.254 --> 01:29:37.835]  You're amazing.
[01:29:37.855 --> 01:29:38.815]  Your whole crew's amazing.
[01:29:38.855 --> 01:29:46.439]  I want to just say, as one American, as one Christian to another, I salute you, and it's great in this short life to be associated with folks like you.
[01:29:46.459 --> 01:29:47.099]  We appreciate you.
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:48.620]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:29:49.921 --> 01:29:53.502]  We're going to come back with Roger Stone, and I'll probably open the phones up as well.
[01:29:55.962 --> 01:29:57.004]  This is really good.
[01:29:57.065 --> 01:29:58.448]  This is really good stuff's happening.
[01:29:59.129 --> 01:30:00.031]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.532 --> 01:30:02.115]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.136 --> 01:30:05.763]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.512 --> 01:30:16.218]  Donald Trump is not even president yet and he is already cashing in on his word of bringing jobs back to America.
[01:30:16.438 --> 01:30:21.864]  I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
[01:30:22.504 --> 01:30:25.087]  I'll bring back our jobs and I'll bring back our money.
[01:30:25.227 --> 01:30:32.755]  Ford has decided to continue to manufacture its Lincoln MKC in Louisville, Kentucky and not move to Mexico as they had previously planned.
[01:30:32.975 --> 01:30:38.838]  Ford has said they are happy to work with President Trump and are glad he is making American manufacturing competitive and great again.
[01:30:39.078 --> 01:30:43.520]  Reports are also surfacing that Apple is considering manufacturing their iPhones in California.
[01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:50.123]  Apple has asked its Asian-based manufacturers Foxconn and Pegatron to explore manufacturing their iPhones in America.
[01:30:50.283 --> 01:30:54.225]  Are these the first dominoes to get Americans off the welfare state and into the workforce?
[01:30:54.525 --> 01:30:58.448]  Will there be a time when you can pick up an electronic and it says Made in America?
[01:30:58.668 --> 01:31:00.769]  Coming soon to a presidency near you.
[01:31:01.029 --> 01:31:05.892]  I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
[01:31:06.012 --> 01:31:07.373]  I tell you that.
[01:31:07.393 --> 01:31:09.715]  This is Owen Troyer for InfoWars.com

[01:32:19.087 --> 01:32:27.172]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:32:27.472 --> 01:32:32.174]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:32:32.355 --> 01:32:39.058]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:39.158 --> 01:32:46.221]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:32:46.322 --> 01:32:53.185]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:32:53.345 --> 01:32:57.706]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:32:57.826 --> 01:33:01.087]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[01:33:07.509 --> 01:33:09.229]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:33:09.289 --> 01:33:18.952]  This is our land.
[01:33:24.941 --> 01:33:27.188]  These are our people.
[01:33:28.272 --> 01:33:28.974]  The workers.
[01:33:29.977 --> 01:33:31.158]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:59.994 --> 01:34:02.542]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:34:08.829 --> 01:34:10.230]  Oh, a news-breaking story.
[01:34:10.590 --> 01:34:13.452]  Security experts discovered a secret backdoor.
[01:34:13.793 --> 01:34:24.220]  What we're talking about is software from a Chinese company already pre-installed, already loaded in an estimated 700 million Android devices.
[01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:25.781]  Again, pre-installed.
[01:34:26.121 --> 01:34:27.302]  If you bought it, it was already in there.
[01:34:27.883 --> 01:34:31.265]  We're talking phones, TVs, cars, wearables,
[01:34:31.425 --> 01:34:40.885]  It lets Chinese officials potentially listen to your phone calls, read all your text messages, steal your family and friends phone numbers, even remotely control your device to install things like apps.
[01:34:41.466 --> 01:34:42.287]  Morgan, when are you making that?
[01:34:43.226 --> 01:34:44.887]  Look, I was very concerned about that.
[01:34:44.947 --> 01:34:48.728]  I was the Vice President at Alcatel-Lucent, where we're building out the National Public Safety Broadband.
[01:34:48.788 --> 01:34:55.111]  We had concerns about two companies out of China, which are the ones that are the cell phone manufacturers, Huawei and ZTE.
[01:34:55.411 --> 01:35:04.354]  Their ties to the People's Liberation Army, the fact that generals are running this, and a House Select Committee on Intelligence issued a report in 2012 talking about the dangers of this.
[01:35:04.394 --> 01:35:07.916]  So now what you have, Liz, is you've got pre-installed spying software.
[01:35:07.936 --> 01:35:08.416]  They say Opus
[01:35:08.456 --> 01:35:09.197]  This was a mistake.
[01:35:09.217 --> 01:35:10.898]  We didn't mean to have this on American phones.
[01:35:11.298 --> 01:35:12.899]  You've got 700 million phones.
[01:35:12.919 --> 01:35:13.800]  You're collecting data.
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:14.861]  You know where it's coming from.
[01:35:15.201 --> 01:35:17.903]  So I don't think it's a mistake that they were collecting this information.
[01:35:18.284 --> 01:35:19.585]  It was found inadvertently.
[01:35:19.605 --> 01:35:20.005]  That's good.
[01:35:20.125 --> 01:35:23.067]  That's from Fox Business actually doing their job.
[01:35:23.628 --> 01:35:25.709]  The best stuff is on Fox Business on Mainstream TV.
[01:35:25.729 --> 01:35:26.710]  The best is Fox Business.
[01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:28.732]  It's almost as good as InfoWars sometimes.
[01:35:29.212 --> 01:35:29.893]  But notice...
[01:35:31.667 --> 01:35:33.508]  That's not what the General Fox viewers are getting.
[01:35:33.568 --> 01:35:34.188]  It's very sad.
[01:35:34.648 --> 01:35:37.169]  But that's because smart business viewers want real information.
[01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:38.090]  They don't want a bunch of bull.
[01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:45.533]  I had to play that clip because last hour, I have to correct myself, I said 70 million phones had the software loaded on.
[01:35:45.573 --> 01:35:46.153]  I apologize.
[01:35:46.193 --> 01:35:47.294]  It's 700 million.
[01:35:48.074 --> 01:35:48.994]  And I've said this many times.
[01:35:49.114 --> 01:35:51.255]  Nine times out of 10, I'm not exaggerating.
[01:35:52.856 --> 01:35:54.197]  I tend to dial stuff back.
[01:35:54.237 --> 01:35:55.597]  It's a real problem I've got.
[01:35:55.637 --> 01:35:56.778]  I'm not trying to lie.
[01:35:57.651 --> 01:36:00.636]  But I tend to dial back and then people think I'm dialing up.
[01:36:00.757 --> 01:36:01.999]  Oh, 70 million phones.
[01:36:02.059 --> 01:36:04.163]  I mean, come on.
[01:36:04.183 --> 01:36:04.984]  700 million devices.
[01:36:06.206 --> 01:36:06.968]  Phones, you name it.
[01:36:08.444 --> 01:36:17.269]  Now, again, I've had whistleblowers on 20 years ago from the NSA, James Bamford, you name it, telling us all this.
[01:36:17.789 --> 01:36:18.810]  They've been doing it that long.
[01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:21.491]  Look, I'm not out to get Chinese people because they're Asian.
[01:36:21.912 --> 01:36:23.172]  My sister's Korean adopted.
[01:36:23.192 --> 01:36:23.733]  I love her to death.
[01:36:24.353 --> 01:36:25.794]  China feeds on its own people.
[01:36:25.834 --> 01:36:29.496]  The point is, is when Trump says we're being screwed by China, man, we're being screwed.
[01:36:29.516 --> 01:36:31.677]  And they try to have this fake nationalism against Russia.
[01:36:32.498 --> 01:36:33.478]  Russia's not doing this.
[01:36:33.999 --> 01:36:35.740]  Russia can barely keep from collapsing.
[01:36:36.493 --> 01:36:37.715]  Because they've been under global sanctions.
[01:36:38.035 --> 01:36:39.076]  The threat is China!
[01:36:40.258 --> 01:36:43.903]  So joining us for the rest of the hour is Roger Stone of StoneColdTruth.com.
[01:36:43.923 --> 01:36:46.566]  Every Wednesday, he's going to host the fourth hour here.
[01:36:46.606 --> 01:36:47.747]  Paul Watson hosts Thursdays.
[01:36:49.025 --> 01:36:50.346]  Russ the crew hosts other hours.
[01:36:51.126 --> 01:37:02.652]  I do intend, in the near future, as soon as we get another line of crew hired, because we got one crew working seven days a week right now, we're going to add more broadcast here to the InfoWars operation.
[01:37:03.192 --> 01:37:14.798]  And more than happy to work with the folks at GCN as well, but we are more and more doing things on our own, syndicating the broadcast, sending it out on satellite ourselves, just because it's better to do it, you know, here out of the Hacienda in Austin, Texas.
[01:37:14.819 --> 01:37:15.459]  But I gotta tell you,
[01:37:16.997 --> 01:37:21.980]  I'm an eternal pessimist because I don't want to get arrogant and think I'm winning.
[01:37:23.981 --> 01:37:25.482]  And then have a problem.
[01:37:28.905 --> 01:37:33.067]  I shot a big elk a few weeks ago and looked like he was down.
[01:37:33.107 --> 01:37:35.008]  I went over there, some great steaks, the crew's been eating it.
[01:37:35.789 --> 01:37:38.471]  And I got over there 20 minutes later and he got up.
[01:37:39.315 --> 01:37:45.283]  It was pretty dangerous and I had to pull out my Smith & Wesson 500 handgun that I had on my side and take him down.
[01:37:45.323 --> 01:37:48.007]  But again, you don't want to be too confident.
[01:37:48.027 --> 01:37:51.491]  We don't want to say, as the wolf says in Pulp Fiction, that all is well.
[01:37:52.092 --> 01:37:54.055]  We can all service each other at this point.
[01:37:56.482 --> 01:38:00.405]  We're winning, but I didn't celebrate enough 8, 9, 10 days ago.
[01:38:00.745 --> 01:38:03.928]  I will tell you, Sessions is a great choice to the Attorney General ship.
[01:38:04.748 --> 01:38:12.694]  Ford returning, 62 days before Trump even gets in because Trump called the heir to the Ford dynasty and said, look, stop being anti-American.
[01:38:13.375 --> 01:38:15.116]  I'm going to tax the hell out of you if you don't do it.
[01:38:15.136 --> 01:38:15.897]  He capitulated.
[01:38:15.957 --> 01:38:16.717]  It's the president, folks.
[01:38:16.737 --> 01:38:17.338]  It's got power.
[01:38:17.998 --> 01:38:19.419]  The globals want to sell that power out.
[01:38:19.459 --> 01:38:20.100]  We've still got it.
[01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:21.441]  We can still get a reprieve.
[01:38:21.721 --> 01:38:23.022]  Apple says they're probably going to come back.
[01:38:25.339 --> 01:38:30.381]  Just a lot of really positive things, a lot of good things are happening, and then we got the numbers for InfoWars today.
[01:38:30.681 --> 01:38:50.330]  They put us in this database, put out by some Ford Foundation, Southern Poverty Law Center connected professor woman, who I guess is God, and they delisted InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, Breitbart.com, Project Veritas, everybody, saying we were fake, and then Google was putting up messages saying, don't go to these sites, they're dangerous.
[01:38:50.350 --> 01:38:52.131]  We're going to Roger Stone here in about 10 seconds.
[01:38:53.417 --> 01:38:56.359]  And I love where he says he's in a parking garage.
[01:38:56.399 --> 01:38:57.319]  Like leaking the deep throat.
[01:38:57.359 --> 01:39:03.262]  Like Drudge says, only safe spot to talk to in a parking garage these days with the Chinese 700 million devices being tracked by him.
[01:39:03.903 --> 01:39:06.284]  I told people 20 years ago they could dial into your phone and listen to you.
[01:39:06.304 --> 01:39:07.084]  Now it's all admitted.
[01:39:07.124 --> 01:39:07.545]  See folks?
[01:39:07.865 --> 01:39:09.786]  Another thing we've been caught in fake news.
[01:39:10.046 --> 01:39:16.609]  But they had to back off today when they finally relisted, who knows how high it went, Infowars.com today.
[01:39:16.629 --> 01:39:17.250]  It was 126 on the web.
[01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.770]  Drudge is like 100.
[01:39:17.810 --> 01:39:18.290]  So, when I tell you,
[01:39:21.991 --> 01:39:24.093]  That we're getting 10, 15, 20 million visitors a day, folks.
[01:39:24.133 --> 01:39:24.654]  I'm not kidding.
[01:39:24.734 --> 01:39:26.476]  And let me expand on that.
[01:39:26.496 --> 01:39:29.879]  80 plus million viewers election week.
[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:32.262]  And I thought it would actually trail off.
[01:39:33.804 --> 01:39:34.284]  It hasn't.
[01:39:35.405 --> 01:39:36.606]  I mean, it's not.
[01:39:36.847 --> 01:39:38.268]  I thought it would go down by like 60 percent.
[01:39:38.529 --> 01:39:40.050]  It's only going down by like 20 percent.
[01:39:40.791 --> 01:39:42.052]  This is just insane.
[01:39:42.975 --> 01:39:46.419]  And the problem is, I'm just wondering how they're going to strike back.
[01:39:46.439 --> 01:39:50.064]  You've got them desperately trying to prop up globalism, meeting with Merkel, Obama.
[01:39:50.504 --> 01:39:52.187]  Roger Stone, how big is this win?
[01:39:52.207 --> 01:39:54.650]  I mean, you wanted me to celebrate last week.
[01:39:54.670 --> 01:39:56.572]  You said, look, tomorrow we can get back on the parapet.
[01:39:56.872 --> 01:39:58.614]  But I've got to tell you, I'm ready to celebrate now.
[01:39:58.655 --> 01:40:00.417]  I'm kind of having delayed euphoria here.
[01:40:02.332 --> 01:40:10.233]  Well, Alex, I am reaching you from a parking garage, kind of a homage to Deep Throat, if you will.
[01:40:11.474 --> 01:40:15.454]  I am in town to meet with some of the transition people.
[01:40:15.574 --> 01:40:17.295]  Look, I'm very, very pleased.
[01:40:18.015 --> 01:40:19.135]  Excellent news today.
[01:40:19.535 --> 01:40:29.897]  Jeff Sessions, a senator who's been on this program, an early Trump supporter, a believer particularly in sealing our borders.
[01:40:30.457 --> 01:40:30.697]  I think?
[01:40:48.438 --> 01:40:54.043]  The Clintons and went to the Trump side.
[01:40:54.543 --> 01:40:56.344]  Actively campaigning for Trump.
[01:40:56.725 --> 01:40:59.167]  A very effective surrogate for Donald Trump.
[01:40:59.567 --> 01:41:01.108]  Now at NSA.
[01:41:01.148 --> 01:41:05.131]  You see the beginnings of a team of nationalists.
[01:41:05.552 --> 01:41:11.997]  A team of men and women who will put America, not the globalist agenda first.
[01:41:12.137 --> 01:41:14.018]  So, so far so good Alex.
[01:41:14.098 --> 01:41:14.859]  I'm very pleased.
[01:41:16.206 --> 01:41:18.632]  Let's keep talking about the situation with Flynn and NSA.
[01:41:18.652 --> 01:41:18.752]  Wow.
[01:41:22.475 --> 01:41:27.219]  Well, there was an attempt to derail him by some of the globalists.
[01:41:28.140 --> 01:41:38.790]  General Flynn had filed with the Congress to do some lobbying, essentially educational work, for a Turkish-American interest.
[01:41:39.811 --> 01:41:44.595]  Evidently, he did not file a Foreign Agents Registration Act.
[01:41:44.635 --> 01:41:48.539]  It's not clear that he needed to, but he may have needed to.
[01:41:49.119 --> 01:41:50.501]  It was an oversight.
[01:41:50.661 --> 01:41:53.745]  It was very clearly an honest mistake.
[01:41:53.845 --> 01:41:55.186]  I think it's being rectified.
[01:41:55.687 --> 01:42:00.933]  In no way should it keep this distinguished man from serving in the Trump cabinet.
[01:42:02.395 --> 01:42:04.557]  And Trump wants him for the head of the National Security Agency.
[01:42:04.577 --> 01:42:05.118]  That's a big deal.
[01:42:07.170 --> 01:42:16.934]  It's an enormous deal because, of course, it coordinates the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence, the Pentagon.
[01:42:16.954 --> 01:42:19.916]  I mean, this is the job that Henry Kissinger had.
[01:42:20.756 --> 01:42:26.138]  This is the molder of the President's foreign policy.
[01:42:27.139 --> 01:42:30.320]  And look, I wanted Flynn for Vice President.
[01:42:31.053 --> 01:42:31.293]  I think?
[01:42:51.002 --> 01:42:59.347]  Yeah, this is a general who was basically removed by Obama two and a half years ago because he wouldn't back ISIS and Al Qaeda in Syria.
[01:42:59.547 --> 01:43:01.569]  This is a guy that blew the whistle and exposed the whole thing.
[01:43:03.650 --> 01:43:05.171]  That's exactly right, Alex.
[01:43:05.211 --> 01:43:06.251]  He's shown his mettle.
[01:43:06.672 --> 01:43:12.455]  This guy stood up to the Clintons and he's an excellent choice.
[01:43:13.036 --> 01:43:18.359]  There is discussion now of Governor Jan Brewer going to Interior.
[01:43:19.256 --> 01:43:20.657]  Former Governor of Arizona.
[01:43:20.737 --> 01:43:23.418]  She would also be an excellent choice.
[01:43:23.578 --> 01:43:28.641]  Again, an early Trump supporter, not a globalist, a nationalist.
[01:43:29.281 --> 01:43:34.544]  These are the kind of names that I'm hearing, and they're very encouraging.
[01:43:34.644 --> 01:43:38.386]  The battle royal, of course, is still Secretary of State.
[01:43:38.606 --> 01:43:42.788]  Now, there's no question former Mayor Giuliani has expressed his interest.
[01:43:43.488 --> 01:43:49.512]  Former UN representative under Bush, John Bolton, has expressed his interest.
[01:43:50.232 --> 01:43:56.456]  Senator Robert Corker is, I think, ranking on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has expressed an interest.
[01:43:57.197 --> 01:43:59.078]  Yesterday, evidently, the President-elect
[01:43:59.705 --> 01:44:03.628]  Reached out to Nikki Haley, the Governor of South Carolina.
[01:44:04.109 --> 01:44:17.739]  Now, I don't know that she has the credentials for Secretary of State, but it tells me that perhaps, perhaps, the President-Elect is looking for another choice for Secretary of State.
[01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:19.821]  Look, I know John Bolton.
[01:44:19.941 --> 01:44:20.781]  I like John Bolton.
[01:44:21.282 --> 01:44:22.102]  He's a great guy.
[01:44:22.523 --> 01:44:24.084]  He's a great guy to play poker with.
[01:44:24.124 --> 01:44:26.066]  He's a great guy to drink with.
[01:44:26.106 --> 01:44:27.487]  He's a great guy to play cards with.
[01:44:28.477 --> 01:44:33.747]  Uh, but he's not, uh, he's not a non-interventionist, particularly when it comes to Russia.
[01:44:33.787 --> 01:44:37.493]  Let's just say it, he's got a hard-on for, he's got a, he's got a neocon hard-on for Russia.
[01:44:40.799 --> 01:44:54.030]  Yes, now he did, to his credit, unlike many of the other neocons who cut and ran, he supported Trump in the general election, and he very actively campaigned for it.
[01:44:55.091 --> 01:45:06.961]  So he has some standing in the camp, but I would really like to see somebody who more accurately reflects the President's views on Russia as well as... Sure, why don't they just send him back to be the U.S.
[01:45:07.041 --> 01:45:07.901]  Ambassador to the U.N.
[01:45:07.941 --> 01:45:08.342]  or something?
[01:45:08.362 --> 01:45:09.643]  Why promote him as Secretary of State?
[01:45:11.545 --> 01:45:15.092]  Well, look, there may be another place for Bolton to serve.
[01:45:15.132 --> 01:45:16.254]  He's an able man.
[01:45:16.835 --> 01:45:21.042]  But you can bring a whore to church, that doesn't mean you should ask her to lead the choir.
[01:45:23.069 --> 01:45:25.030]  All right, look, I've been asking some of the questions here.
[01:45:25.530 --> 01:45:27.471]  What else is going on in Trump-landia?
[01:45:27.791 --> 01:45:29.332]  He's delivering on so many fronts.
[01:45:29.672 --> 01:45:35.214]  They're just, this seems to be so exciting and mainstream media's numbers are still declining.
[01:45:35.735 --> 01:45:37.075]  Liberty Media is exploding.
[01:45:37.095 --> 01:45:38.556]  We completely dwarf them now.
[01:45:39.216 --> 01:45:42.117]  This is just, I believe a total tipping point's been achieved.
[01:45:42.618 --> 01:45:47.640]  I'm concerned, though, that they're going to get so panicked that they hit the panic button and do something rash.
[01:45:49.178 --> 01:46:03.646]  Well, I have now been able to confirm something you reported last night, Alex, and that is Chelsea Clinton has reached out to members of the Trump family in a desperate plea not to have her parents prosecuted.
[01:46:04.466 --> 01:46:06.688]  Unfortunately, it does not work that way.
[01:46:06.788 --> 01:46:10.250]  We are a nation of laws, not a nation of men.
[01:46:10.930 --> 01:46:17.634]  And I think those in the Trump inner circle believe that this is a question that is best left to the grand jury.
[01:46:18.354 --> 01:46:24.639]  This is a question that is left not to politics, but to career prosecutors who can examine all the facts.
[01:46:25.139 --> 01:46:27.001]  There's a lot of alleged crimes here.
[01:46:27.021 --> 01:46:28.662]  30 years of alleged crimes.
[01:46:28.742 --> 01:46:32.285]  As you know, Alex, there's no statute of limitations on treason.
[01:46:32.946 --> 01:46:47.537]  So perhaps selling missile-targeting technology to the Chinese in return for campaign contributions, perhaps a special prosecutor should visit that issue and see exactly what happened.
[01:46:49.326 --> 01:46:58.348]  What do you think the pucker factor was this morning when President-elect Trump selected for confirmation, which I'm sure he'll get in the Senate, being Senator Sessions with a great record.
[01:46:58.828 --> 01:47:05.430]  What was the pucker factor over at the Clinton Crime Command Center when they learned that Senator Sessions is going to be the new Attorney General?
[01:47:05.470 --> 01:47:09.651]  I mean, that had to absolutely have the fear of God in those scumbags.
[01:47:10.350 --> 01:47:14.271]  Yeah, I would have thought people would have been jumping out of some of the high windows in the building.
[01:47:14.331 --> 01:47:20.792]  Look, Jeff Sessions is the law and order attorney general that Donald Trump was describing.
[01:47:21.673 --> 01:47:24.033]  This is precisely the man you need.
[01:47:24.133 --> 01:47:31.295]  Yeah, I hate to gloat, but I mean, every time I think about it, I'm having... My brain's releasing just endorphins right now, Roger.
[01:47:31.335 --> 01:47:31.855]  Is that okay?
[01:47:33.117 --> 01:47:41.443]  Well, look, I had kind of a secret hope that Sessions might go to defense, but I'm very happy with him as AG.
[01:47:41.923 --> 01:48:00.735]  There is some discussion of General Mattis at defense, another military leader who came to Trump's side early, who is tired of the half-hearted efforts in foreign policy of the Obama administration, where you don't really know whether they're in business to help our enemies or to thwart our friends.
[01:48:01.136 --> 01:48:02.997]  But that seems to be the bottom line.
[01:48:03.597 --> 01:48:12.222]  Meanwhile, my friends in Chappaqua tell me that Hillary Clinton is heavily sedated and that they are really huddling with their lawyers.
[01:48:12.242 --> 01:48:16.164]  Let me stop you because you said to me privately on election, I don't know if I can say this.
[01:48:16.725 --> 01:48:17.825]  Well, I'm going to say it.
[01:48:18.526 --> 01:48:25.330]  You were the first person to tell me that it had been confirmed that Hillary had dressed folks up in Bernie outfits in Chicago to go attack.
[01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:26.751]  I later talked to
[01:48:27.771 --> 01:48:56.472]  sources in Chicago and they said no the cops high-level had told them that over dinner because one of these guys is friends with one of the high-level police captains and they were so pissed because they were ordered just let them beat cops up you name it it was just in beat up families it was just so disgraceful you were right on that and and and then you said election night on air oh I bet she's sedated but you said privately well the word is she's flipping out she's sedated it's now come out from Secret Service from CNN people that she blew up for hours had to be sedated that's why she wasn't out to the next day
[01:48:56.952 --> 01:49:01.917]  And now she comes out on Wednesday and looks like she's dying with no makeup on.
[01:49:01.937 --> 01:49:03.498]  It looks like she's about to die.
[01:49:03.518 --> 01:49:05.019]  So you just dropped that bombshell.
[01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:05.880]  What's going on?
[01:49:06.881 --> 01:49:09.524]  Well, look, I think you and I were absolutely right.
[01:49:09.724 --> 01:49:11.966]  We said at the time that her health was not good.
[01:49:12.026 --> 01:49:15.249]  We were told it was a conspiracy theory.
[01:49:15.689 --> 01:49:17.391]  Still don't believe her health is good.
[01:49:18.001 --> 01:49:24.327]  Uh, when you see her without the makeup, when you see her without the careful lighting, she does not look well.
[01:49:24.908 --> 01:49:31.634]  Uh, I have confirmed, as you did, that she threw a violent fit when she learned that she was not going to win.
[01:49:31.754 --> 01:49:34.277]  She was, uh, her usual foul-mouthed self.
[01:49:34.317 --> 01:49:35.398]  She attacked Podesta, right?
[01:49:36.579 --> 01:49:46.942]  Screaming obscenities at MOOC and Podesta over what could have been the worst presidential campaign in modern political history.
[01:49:47.002 --> 01:50:01.726]  Given the billion dollars plus that they had to spend dwarfing the lousy $250,000 that Donald Trump spent, he's very proud of the fact that he spent less money and got more votes.
[01:50:01.986 --> 01:50:07.755]  Why do you think Uma Abedin seemed like, uh, looking even more anorexic, crying in public, totally freaked out?
[01:50:09.434 --> 01:50:27.260]  Well, she may be looking for a sympathy factor, perhaps that's where this is going, that people will feel sorry for her and therefore perhaps she won't be prosecuted, but there are crimes at the Clinton Foundation, Alex, that are even as yet unreported.
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:28.021]  Sure, of course.
[01:50:28.221 --> 01:50:37.724]  But when I look at the work of Charles Ortel, who's one of the most respected guys, retired from Wall Street, a true financial expert, someone who has
[01:50:38.384 --> 01:50:50.553]  We're going to come back in the final segment with Roger Stone and get into whatever he wants to talk about.
[01:50:50.573 --> 01:50:57.418]  I've been asking the questions here, but wow, what an amazing time to be alive and to see Trump delivering, delivering, delivering, delivering.
[01:50:57.478 --> 01:50:58.519]  All I care about is policy.
[01:50:59.710 --> 01:51:02.137]  I don't care if he puts Santa Claus in, you know, Secretary of State.
[01:51:02.477 --> 01:51:05.144]  Santa Claus better do what Trump wants and better deliver this republic back.
[01:51:05.586 --> 01:51:07.390]  And so far, I'm seeing Trump deliver 100%.
[01:51:07.892 --> 01:51:08.533]  This is incredible.
[01:51:10.555 --> 01:51:10.895]  No problem.
[01:51:10.935 --> 01:51:12.236]  I don't have a problem with that.
[01:51:12.256 --> 01:51:14.517]  Have you heard the latest in Colorado?
[01:51:14.537 --> 01:51:14.937]  18,000 new jobs!
[01:51:14.957 --> 01:51:16.718]  So if Trump endorses marijuana,
[01:51:33.867 --> 01:51:46.877]  He'll have a good chance to be successful on bringing jobs back because there's 18,000 alone in Colorado and it's been a $2.4 billion boost to the Colorado economy.
[01:51:46.897 --> 01:51:48.198]  It's no different than booze.
[01:51:48.478 --> 01:51:50.159]  You got Everclear alcohol.
[01:51:50.179 --> 01:51:51.800]  You got 151 rum.
[01:51:51.860 --> 01:51:54.382]  If you drink that stuff, it'll knock you into tomorrow.
[01:51:54.702 --> 01:51:57.724]  You know what the positive thing is about stronger marijuana?
[01:51:58.065 --> 01:51:58.785]  It's healthier.
[01:51:58.885 --> 01:51:59.786]  You smoke less.
[01:52:00.266 --> 01:52:05.951]  When Arizona voted it down, they were the only state where it lost, Arizona.
[01:52:06.731 --> 01:52:09.273]  My quote was, shame on you, Arizona.
[01:52:09.613 --> 01:52:13.156]  If Jimi Hendrix were alive today, he would not play Phoenix.
[01:52:14.277 --> 01:52:16.879]  I hope Donald brings in new people.
[01:52:17.339 --> 01:52:22.283]  I hope he does what he said, drains the swamp and starts, that's the mandate he got.
[01:52:22.483 --> 01:52:22.903]  They would.
[01:52:22.963 --> 01:52:23.424]  They would.
[01:52:49.059 --> 01:52:52.941]  And the problem with marijuana is you could grow it in your backyard.
[01:52:52.961 --> 01:52:55.603]  Therefore, you wouldn't have to pay the government.
[01:52:55.683 --> 01:52:58.044]  Poor people could grow it and have access to it.
[01:52:58.424 --> 01:53:01.786]  And they likewise wouldn't have to pay the government or Big Pharma.
[01:53:02.086 --> 01:53:08.450]  And that's really the sticking point on why government puts up this resistance to the legalization of marijuana.
[01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:12.372]  Well, the bigger point is... You'd have access to not have to pay them to get it.
[01:53:12.732 --> 01:53:14.913]  It gave me my quality of life back.
[01:53:14.993 --> 01:53:17.575]  Someone close to me developed a seizure disorder.
[01:53:18.415 --> 01:53:19.556]  We're good to go.
[01:53:39.309 --> 01:53:40.270]  We're good to go.
[01:53:57.045 --> 01:54:06.733]  Let's plant positively instead of doing what the government... So as far as Donald goes on marijuana, Donald clean house and allow it to be legalized.
[01:54:07.113 --> 01:54:08.334]  It's jobs, baby.
[01:54:08.615 --> 01:54:10.016]  You'll deliver on it then.
[01:54:11.889 --> 01:54:12.349]  Get up!
[01:54:12.489 --> 01:54:13.050]  Stand up!
[01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:15.070]  Escape from the prison planet.
[01:54:15.090 --> 01:54:15.891]  We got five more minutes.
[01:54:16.771 --> 01:54:20.933]  We also are going to be taking your phone calls.
[01:54:21.573 --> 01:54:22.734]  And we've got Roger Stone with us.
[01:54:22.754 --> 01:54:23.694]  I was talking to him during the break.
[01:54:23.734 --> 01:54:24.634]  I said, what's most important?
[01:54:24.654 --> 01:54:25.975]  He's going to reiterate that to you right now.
[01:54:25.995 --> 01:54:27.936]  I'm not going to belabor this because there's so much to cover.
[01:54:28.336 --> 01:54:29.216]  We need your support.
[01:54:29.296 --> 01:54:30.977]  Yes, we may be 126 on the web, and we may reach 5 billion people.
[01:54:35.311 --> 01:54:36.192]  That's an old number, by the way.
[01:54:37.152 --> 01:54:38.953]  But I'm not good at making money.
[01:54:39.453 --> 01:54:41.894]  And so for a media operation this big, we should have 10 times the money.
[01:54:42.054 --> 01:54:43.294]  I want to be able to get more reporters.
[01:54:44.575 --> 01:54:46.456]  I want to take care of the folks I got here that deserve it.
[01:54:46.476 --> 01:54:47.256]  I appreciate you.
[01:54:47.496 --> 01:54:49.497]  We got great products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:54:49.977 --> 01:54:55.339]  We've got the new Brain Force now with 20% more capsules in each bottle.
[01:54:55.419 --> 01:54:56.059]  Great nootropic.

[01:54:59.681 --> 01:55:00.421]  We appreciate you.

[01:55:03.003 --> 01:55:08.207]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:55:08.247 --> 01:55:16.454]  Now going back to Roger Stone, we have both of his books for sale and the collector Bill Clinton rape shirt available as well at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:55:17.455 --> 01:55:24.180]  We're getting into the other issues we're looking at, what we're facing and how we make sure Trump is surrounded by real patriots.
[01:55:25.459 --> 01:55:32.882]  Well Alex, first thing I've got to tell you is that everybody in my family now wants a Trump is my President t-shirt for Inauguration Day.
[01:55:33.002 --> 01:55:35.684]  So I think they were ordering yesterday.
[01:55:35.704 --> 01:55:44.708]  I can see this is going to be a very hot item for both those who are going to the inauguration and those who can't make it.
[01:55:45.228 --> 01:55:53.071]  We are exploring having a pro-Trump demonstration to support the President at the inauguration.
[01:55:53.091 --> 01:55:54.052]  Let's just say we're going to do it.
[01:55:55.601 --> 01:55:57.763]  We are out there looking for a location.
[01:55:58.183 --> 01:55:59.183]  I know you're interested.
[01:55:59.523 --> 01:56:01.885]  We should have details momentarily.
[01:56:01.905 --> 01:56:14.091]  I think it's very important that supporters of the president show a... Yeah, we don't just let the communists and all the racists run around and claim that there's no opposition to them and let them hog all the media.
[01:56:15.126 --> 01:56:15.607]  Exactly.
[01:56:15.647 --> 01:56:16.849]  There's no way we're going to do that.
[01:56:16.949 --> 01:56:20.013]  So the difference is our people aren't going to be paid to be there.
[01:56:20.594 --> 01:56:24.399]  Our people are going to be there because they're patriots, because they're true believers.
[01:56:24.940 --> 01:56:30.007]  The Soros crowd, as you know, they'll be there because they're being paid to be there.
[01:56:30.047 --> 01:56:30.608]  They're paid
[01:56:31.108 --> 01:56:32.449]  Agents provocateur.
[01:56:33.170 --> 01:56:34.210]  Paid agitators.
[01:56:35.871 --> 01:56:38.693]  These demonstrations are getting more and more pathetic.
[01:56:39.614 --> 01:56:44.978]  In Fort Lauderdale they were handing out flyers saying Donald Trump will dissolve gay marriages.
[01:56:45.958 --> 01:56:46.519]  No he won't.
[01:56:47.099 --> 01:56:49.761]  That's not what he said with Leslie Stahl on 60 Minutes.
[01:56:49.821 --> 01:56:52.343]  It's not what he said in his acceptance speech.
[01:56:52.583 --> 01:56:54.104]  That's not what he's ever said.
[01:56:54.504 --> 01:56:58.227]  It's the kind of leftist smear that we're looking at.
[01:56:59.241 --> 01:56:59.961]  That's right.
[01:57:00.021 --> 01:57:00.881]  What about Steve Bannon?
[01:57:00.922 --> 01:57:01.942]  They are really gunning for him.
[01:57:03.242 --> 01:57:04.703]  Steve Bannon is a patriot.
[01:57:05.683 --> 01:57:07.323]  He is not an anti-Semite.
[01:57:07.724 --> 01:57:08.844]  He is not a bigot.
[01:57:09.244 --> 01:57:12.405]  He is not a white supremacist.
[01:57:12.705 --> 01:57:13.545]  We're mainstream.
[01:57:13.985 --> 01:57:14.866]  They're the radicals.
[01:57:14.946 --> 01:57:15.906]  What are they talking about?
[01:57:16.046 --> 01:57:17.687]  We are the American mainstream.
[01:57:18.227 --> 01:57:19.907]  Yes, he wants to seal our borders.
[01:57:20.427 --> 01:57:22.208]  Yes, he believes in the rule of law.
[01:57:22.648 --> 01:57:26.569]  Yes, he wants us to have better trade deals with our trading partners.
[01:57:26.969 --> 01:57:28.830]  He wants to rebuild our national economy.
[01:57:29.562 --> 01:57:31.763]  They hate him because he's effective.
[01:57:32.364 --> 01:57:34.865]  They hate him because he sees the big picture.
[01:57:35.005 --> 01:57:37.667]  And he knows who Trump's real enemies are.
[01:57:38.127 --> 01:57:40.508]  So I think he's in great shape.
[01:57:40.589 --> 01:57:41.929]  I think he's doing a great job.
[01:57:42.330 --> 01:57:45.651]  And the mainstream media effort to lynch him has failed.
[01:57:46.392 --> 01:57:47.312]  It certainly has.
[01:57:48.073 --> 01:57:49.574]  Separately, just the minute we have left.
[01:57:50.888 --> 01:57:57.573]  They're going to counter-strike, but this news of Sessions means that Trump's, I mean, it means Trump's putting in Sessions.
[01:57:57.613 --> 01:58:02.276]  That means justice shows that Hillary is going to get in some big, big trouble now.
[01:58:02.877 --> 01:58:03.717]  Wow, this is big.
[01:58:05.178 --> 01:58:08.821]  Yeah, no, I think grabbing the reins of justice is an absolute key.
[01:58:09.342 --> 01:58:13.645]  Look, we all understand that their game plan, their long-term game plan
[01:58:16.449 --> 01:58:17.190]  That's right.
[01:58:17.751 --> 01:58:20.994]  Their latest fake news thing, within 48 hours, went down as fake.
[01:58:21.014 --> 01:58:22.896]  They're the ones that are fake.
[01:58:22.936 --> 01:58:23.236]  We're not.
[01:58:23.256 --> 01:58:25.278]  That's why we're exploding.
[01:58:26.039 --> 01:58:26.579]  They're dying.
[01:58:26.599 --> 01:58:27.921]  Roger, talk to you soon.
[01:58:28.301 --> 01:58:28.862]  Thank you, my friend.
[01:58:37.731 --> 01:58:38.091]  You bet.
[01:58:38.191 --> 01:58:40.753]  Okay ladies and this Sunday I'll be back 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:58:40.913 --> 01:58:42.795]  in studio live with a Sunday transmission.
[01:58:42.835 --> 01:58:44.496]  We'll be back with the third hour.
[01:58:45.036 --> 01:58:45.557]  Stay with us.
[01:58:45.617 --> 01:58:46.397]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:52.101]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:59:04.578 --> 01:59:11.865]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[01:59:12.045 --> 01:59:22.995]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[01:59:23.495 --> 01:59:31.040]  In the history of InfoWars life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:40.625]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today, with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[01:59:40.945 --> 01:59:45.148]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:59:45.408 --> 01:59:52.153]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[01:59:52.473 --> 01:59:53.634]  That means it's clean.
[01:59:53.934 --> 01:59:55.015]  That means it's pure.
[01:59:55.095 --> 01:59:57.897]  That's simplewashlife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:59:57.997 --> 01:59:59.718]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:00:01.799 --> 02:00:04.381]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:20.169 --> 02:00:23.632]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:00:24.192 --> 02:00:26.014]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.437 --> 02:00:33.540]  Alright, he's popping in for two segments.
[02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:39.645]  Dr. Steve McKinnick, lit update on the intelligence community and everybody that basically turned against Hillary.
[02:00:40.165 --> 02:00:44.108]  And he was just one more person telling you that, documenting it, talking to his sources.
[02:00:44.168 --> 02:00:48.392]  But this is just a massive awakening across the board to tyranny.
[02:00:49.762 --> 02:00:57.569]  And to see Trump now putting Jeff Sessions in as the head attorney general, which he's not confirmed yet, but he's got a very good record, been in the Senate.
[02:00:58.750 --> 02:01:00.272]  I don't see the Senate not confirming him.
[02:01:00.892 --> 02:01:01.833]  This is going to be a big deal.
[02:01:02.674 --> 02:01:04.716]  It's going to be a day long remembered.
[02:01:05.156 --> 02:01:07.078]  And it's not about settling scores with Hillary.
[02:01:08.059 --> 02:01:13.104]  Getting up here on air and going after her, saying put her in prison, putting airplanes in the sky.
[02:01:13.124 --> 02:01:15.306]  She's a very vindictive person.
[02:01:17.711 --> 02:01:18.411]  But I had to do it.
[02:01:19.652 --> 02:01:21.854]  And I would have no power if it wasn't for you.
[02:01:22.574 --> 02:01:28.458]  We're all just one contiguous body that loves liberty, and we absolutely kicked their butt.
[02:01:29.819 --> 02:01:45.650]  And to see record numbers of black and Hispanic Americans vote for Trump against all the brainwashing and all the stuff that he's a racist just showed that self-preservation and common sense is a lot more effective
[02:01:47.338 --> 02:01:48.758]  Then pity party brainwashing.
[02:01:51.939 --> 02:01:57.320]  They want us to be, it's not even racism we face, it's all this neurotic political correctness uptight.
[02:01:57.760 --> 02:02:01.901]  I mean, I'll just tell you, you get around so-called liberals, they're the most anti-liberal people I've ever been around.
[02:02:02.661 --> 02:02:09.123]  Liberal means hospitality and fun and low taxes and freedom and not judging people and stuff like that.
[02:02:09.163 --> 02:02:09.923]  That's how I am.
[02:02:10.843 --> 02:02:12.544]  Until you try to dominate me and guilt me.
[02:02:12.564 --> 02:02:13.804]  I'm like, what the hell are you talking about?
[02:02:14.778 --> 02:02:19.520]  And I've been around modern liberals, man, they are the most obsessed, neurotic weirdos.
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:22.241]  I told the story about a year ago, and we're gonna go to break and come back with our guest.
[02:02:23.362 --> 02:02:33.406]  A couple years ago, I got invited out to a buddy's lake house, and there was a boat dock shared by the community of like, I guess, five, six houses in this little subdivision area.
[02:02:33.426 --> 02:02:38.988]  It was a tiny community organization, homeowners association.
[02:02:40.449 --> 02:02:42.890]  And I'm sitting there with my son,
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:45.581]  He's fishing and I'm fishing.
[02:02:45.601 --> 02:02:47.323]  We're catching perch and catfish in the morning.
[02:02:49.645 --> 02:02:57.072]  And I got a cup of coffee and this lady walks over and she goes, I'm a professor and you know, we're going to have some gypsies here next door.
[02:02:57.092 --> 02:02:58.793]  You're not a racist, you're not going to get gypsies are you?
[02:02:58.833 --> 02:03:02.477]  And I said, I said, what type of gypsy?
[02:03:02.517 --> 02:03:04.178]  Is it a pikey, an Irish gypsy?
[02:03:04.238 --> 02:03:04.899]  Is it a Romanoff?
[02:03:05.159 --> 02:03:06.100]  She goes, oh, you know all that?
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:07.962]  Oh, and I was like, well, well, yeah.
[02:03:09.377 --> 02:03:23.562]  And I was all running through my data sheet, you know, zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
[02:03:38.897 --> 02:03:39.958]  What happened to your eye?
[02:03:39.978 --> 02:03:40.939]  Did someone hit you?
[02:03:40.959 --> 02:03:42.340]  He has a birthmark on the side of his head.
[02:03:43.020 --> 02:03:43.741]  It's kind of sad.
[02:03:43.781 --> 02:03:44.882]  As he's gotten older, it's gone away.
[02:03:44.902 --> 02:03:46.443]  You know, you get attached to things like that.
[02:03:48.224 --> 02:03:50.346]  And he goes, that's my birthmark.
[02:03:50.366 --> 02:03:51.106]  She goes, oh, I'm sorry.
[02:03:51.146 --> 02:03:52.648]  I didn't mean to say you did anything.
[02:03:53.788 --> 02:03:59.813]  And she was like a normal looking white lady, 35, but just a basket case.
[02:03:59.933 --> 02:04:02.675]  I mean, like a cult leader of just weirdness.
[02:04:02.715 --> 02:04:03.856]  And then the Gypsies show up.
[02:04:03.896 --> 02:04:04.717]  They were there that weekend.
[02:04:06.837 --> 02:04:29.758]  They were pretty nice folks except during the day the waves would get big and they had like a three-year-old girl half the time without a life jacket like under the boat dock and stuff and I'm like hey you need to and I'm like googling you know they don't take care of their kids blah blah I'm just like you know the kind of that's dangerous you know and it's just like it's a culture it's like the Nazis I'm going to say the Nazis had a bad culture I mean the gypsies depending on which group you look at
[02:04:30.459 --> 02:04:33.402]  It's about, on average, everybody else is scum but you.
[02:04:34.543 --> 02:04:39.547]  Some gypsy groups mutilate their kids so they can get money for their deformities.
[02:04:40.007 --> 02:04:43.911]  I was in Rome a year and a half ago, man, and the damn gypsies were robbing people in front of me.
[02:04:44.582 --> 02:04:48.225]  They'll come over and take your drink off your table and drink it in front of you.
[02:04:48.285 --> 02:04:51.648]  And it's like, it's, it's, it's like liberals have adopted that.
[02:04:51.668 --> 02:04:52.869]  They're just pissed at everyone.
[02:04:53.089 --> 02:04:54.230]  They're super racist.
[02:04:54.710 --> 02:04:55.991]  And they're saying you're racist.
[02:04:56.111 --> 02:04:58.073]  And it's like, they're just in your face.
[02:04:58.934 --> 02:05:00.915]  This woman was like, am I abusing my son?
[02:05:00.975 --> 02:05:04.078]  She was like literally flipping out because she was so uncomfortable.
[02:05:04.138 --> 02:05:06.460]  She needed to morally be better than me.
[02:05:06.560 --> 02:05:07.741]  It was a form of dominance.
[02:05:09.961 --> 02:05:15.224]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse, minor words, and his was action.
[02:05:15.804 --> 02:05:17.325]  His was what he's done to women.
[02:05:17.365 --> 02:05:23.047]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[02:05:23.267 --> 02:05:25.589]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[02:05:25.929 --> 02:05:32.112]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously, four of them here tonight.
[02:05:32.252 --> 02:05:37.554]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[02:05:48.393 --> 02:05:51.136]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[02:05:51.997 --> 02:05:53.439]  It's a fight for our minds.
[02:05:54.120 --> 02:05:56.042]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.

[02:06:10.106 --> 02:06:17.212]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.

[02:07:10.290 --> 02:07:15.976]  Donald Trump is not even president yet and he is already cashing in on his word of bringing jobs back to America.
[02:07:16.196 --> 02:07:21.622]  I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
[02:07:22.263 --> 02:07:24.846]  I'll bring back our jobs and I'll bring back our money.
[02:07:25.006 --> 02:07:32.514]  Ford has decided to continue to manufacture its Lincoln MKC in Louisville, Kentucky and not move to Mexico as they had previously planned.
[02:07:32.754 --> 02:07:38.597]  Ford has said they are happy to work with President Trump and are glad he is making American manufacturing competitive and great again.
[02:07:38.837 --> 02:07:43.299]  Reports are also surfacing that Apple is considering manufacturing their iPhones in California.
[02:07:43.559 --> 02:07:49.902]  Apple has asked its Asian-based manufacturers Foxconn and Pegatron to explore manufacturing their iPhones in America.
[02:07:50.062 --> 02:07:53.984]  Are these the first dominoes to get Americans off the welfare state and into the workforce?
[02:07:54.304 --> 02:07:58.206]  Will there be a time when you can pick up an electronic and it says Made in America?
[02:07:58.446 --> 02:08:00.528]  Coming soon to a presidency near you.
[02:08:00.808 --> 02:08:05.651]  I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
[02:08:05.791 --> 02:08:07.152]  I tell you that.
[02:08:07.172 --> 02:08:17.618]  This is Owen Troyer for InfoWars.com How many times?
[02:08:18.609 --> 02:08:19.509]  Well, I gotta tell ya.
[02:08:20.250 --> 02:08:24.731]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:25.071 --> 02:08:33.094]  How many times must I tell you, baby?
[02:08:33.154 --> 02:08:35.675]  How many bridges I've got to cross?
[02:08:36.795 --> 02:08:40.756]  How many times must I explain myself?
[02:08:41.136 --> 02:08:44.217]  Before I can talk to the boss?
[02:08:49.079 --> 02:08:50.280]  How many times I gotta tell ya?
[02:08:58.043 --> 02:08:58.383]  Orton!
[02:09:04.847 --> 02:09:05.868]  Got the phone call from Trump.
[02:09:06.348 --> 02:09:08.830]  Said, I'm gonna slap tariffs on your ass, you better stay here.
[02:09:08.850 --> 02:09:10.491]  And they said, you know what, we're gonna stay here.
[02:09:10.551 --> 02:09:14.454]  Apple's saying, you know what, China's collapsing, we think we'll move back to the United States.
[02:09:14.535 --> 02:09:16.916]  All because we got somebody in there who's not out to get the country.
[02:09:16.976 --> 02:09:20.139]  And now, Senator Sessions is gonna be put in as AG.
[02:09:20.159 --> 02:09:21.820]  You know what that signals?
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:22.661]  Indictments.
[02:09:26.596 --> 02:09:28.677]  A lot of good stuff happening, and it's not vindictive.
[02:09:28.717 --> 02:09:36.959]  I just laughed because that witch looked like death warmed over two days ago when she finally popped back up whatever subterranean gremlin pit she's in.
[02:09:37.779 --> 02:09:38.979]  And it is an exciting time.
[02:09:39.019 --> 02:09:41.060]  They're tripling down though with race war crap.
[02:09:41.700 --> 02:09:45.881]  The mayor's put out that whites, whiteness, you know, F whiteness, whites are bad.
[02:09:45.941 --> 02:09:46.962]  That's the mayor.
[02:09:47.042 --> 02:09:49.362]  I mean, this is just an insane asylum level with a white guy.
[02:09:49.382 --> 02:09:55.664]  A lot of German slash Italian ancestry saying that with this weird little psycho controller minions.
[02:09:56.425 --> 02:10:00.849]  The good news is the quote minorities know they're the majority and they want prosperity too.
[02:10:01.470 --> 02:10:03.572]  So it is just incredible what's happening.
[02:10:04.353 --> 02:10:13.363]  Meanwhile they're panicking, the globalism's in trouble, the EU is collapsing, world government's in trouble, but the New York Times comes out and says, I'm insane, globalism doesn't exist.
[02:10:14.204 --> 02:10:15.285]  Talk about gaslighting.
[02:10:15.305 --> 02:10:17.946]  We've got a former psychological warfare head of the State Department.
[02:10:17.966 --> 02:10:19.226]  Maybe he can tell us about gaslighting.
[02:10:20.367 --> 02:10:21.567]  Or maybe it's not gaslighting.
[02:10:21.587 --> 02:10:23.428]  Maybe they're just mentally ill and still delusional.
[02:10:24.008 --> 02:10:25.869]  Dr. Steve Pchenik joins us at the bottom of the hour.
[02:10:25.969 --> 02:10:26.870]  Then your phone calls.
[02:10:27.230 --> 02:10:28.290]  What do you think of the election?
[02:10:28.350 --> 02:10:29.291]  Where all this is going?
[02:10:29.771 --> 02:10:30.972]  I'm certainly going to try to kill Trump.
[02:10:30.992 --> 02:10:31.032]  800-259-9231.
[02:10:31.052 --> 02:10:31.152]  800-259-9231.
[02:10:31.212 --> 02:10:31.332]  Show.
[02:10:31.352 --> 02:10:31.972]  Best-selling author.
[02:10:32.012 --> 02:10:32.872]  Wrote books with Tom Clancy.
[02:10:32.892 --> 02:10:33.173]  Produced films.
[02:10:33.193 --> 02:10:33.453]  Involved in
[02:10:41.056 --> 02:10:42.456]  All sorts of clandestine activities.
[02:10:42.516 --> 02:10:49.498]  Very interesting guy who actually was out there in the, you know, in the fields, in the streets, not just as an analyst, breaking down what's happening.
[02:10:50.318 --> 02:10:52.019]  And boy, Hillary tried to steal five states.
[02:10:52.059 --> 02:10:52.999]  She did steal five states.
[02:10:53.019 --> 02:10:53.839]  She still lost.
[02:10:54.459 --> 02:10:55.220]  But they were confident.
[02:10:55.240 --> 02:10:57.560]  They printed up, you know, Newsweek that she was Madam President.
[02:10:58.380 --> 02:10:59.601]  I think we've reached the tipping point.
[02:10:59.621 --> 02:11:00.521]  We're not out of the woods yet.
[02:11:00.941 --> 02:11:01.821]  But maybe I'm wrong.
[02:11:01.881 --> 02:11:03.962]  Dr. Steve Patrinik, what do you think of StevePatrinik.com?
[02:11:05.780 --> 02:11:10.525]  Alex, I want to congratulate you for getting on the front page of the Washington Post.
[02:11:10.786 --> 02:11:22.358]  I think that's indicative of the fact that Jeff Bezos and the entire liberal community, which was controlling and controlled by the Clintons and the corporations
[02:11:22.398 --> 02:11:22.779]  Yes.
[02:11:39.668 --> 02:11:40.709]  We're good.
[02:12:03.889 --> 02:12:04.410]  Thank you.
[02:12:20.786 --> 02:12:24.389]  The system has now been completely turned upside down.
[02:12:24.889 --> 02:12:39.080]  Never in our history have we had a multi-billionaire who's made his own business, never had to go out and ask for help from others other than his own family, has been bankrupt in his companies, which is standard.
[02:12:39.770 --> 02:12:40.450]  We're good to go.
[02:13:01.204 --> 02:13:01.965]  Welcome him.
[02:13:02.865 --> 02:13:07.348]  I wish him the best of luck and I think he's chosen well.
[02:13:07.949 --> 02:13:12.071]  Jared Kushner, his quiet advisor, I think is quite brilliant.
[02:13:12.672 --> 02:13:17.735]  I think Bannon, as a Chief of Staff, was a very good choice.
[02:13:18.536 --> 02:13:23.059]  And I think the notion that he was anti-Semitic is absolutely absurd.
[02:13:23.319 --> 02:13:26.341]  I mean, Bannon... Well, they don't even say where it comes from.
[02:13:26.361 --> 02:13:27.902]  He's not even anti-Israel anyway.
[02:13:27.922 --> 02:13:29.103]  They just make this crap up.
[02:13:29.798 --> 02:13:35.260]  Well, but Alex, you gotta look at, you know, the press doesn't even look at the basic history.
[02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:41.321]  Bannon was an executive in investment banking in mergers and acquisitions.
[02:13:41.461 --> 02:13:44.162]  Now, I've been in that position in another firm, Kidder.
[02:13:44.922 --> 02:13:49.964]  But to be in Goldman Sachs and to be anti-Semitic, that's just not possible.
[02:13:50.624 --> 02:13:59.530]  Then he went into the movie business and became an executive producer and a producer of a lot of films, again in an industry that was predominantly Jewish.
[02:14:00.150 --> 02:14:09.417]  Then he works with Jared Kushner and Ivana Trump, Ivanka Trump, who basically are Orthodox Jews.
[02:14:09.517 --> 02:14:15.981]  So the notion that he is both an anti-Semite, a racist, and it's just absolute nonsense.
[02:14:16.001 --> 02:14:16.401]  That's nonsense.
[02:14:16.441 --> 02:14:25.024]  So what you see, basically, is the propaganda machine from the left or wherever the paper's coming from has never done due diligence.
[02:14:25.465 --> 02:14:26.725]  They never did due diligence.
[02:14:26.745 --> 02:14:27.765]  They just spew crap.
[02:14:28.526 --> 02:14:37.909]  I mean, what they do is, it's like when I said, a Jewish mafia doesn't run things, I don't believe that, but the Emanuels are a mafia, just like there's Italian mafia, then they turn that into anti-Semitism.
[02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:40.250]  In your view, let me ask you this, what do you think of the Emanuels?
[02:14:40.570 --> 02:14:42.291]  I mean, look at what they've done in Chicago.
[02:14:42.871 --> 02:14:45.153]  One of them, and he happens to be my agent.
[02:14:45.213 --> 02:14:46.955]  He's not a very effective agent.
[02:14:47.075 --> 02:14:51.738]  He took over the William Morris agency with which I've worked with for 30 years.
[02:14:52.099 --> 02:14:58.124]  He's arrogant, self-serving, totally, you know, I think he's a bore.
[02:14:58.424 --> 02:15:00.946]  I mean, I'm no longer with that agency, but...
[02:15:01.306 --> 02:15:02.067]  Sure, that's my point.
[02:15:02.107 --> 02:15:03.628]  As I was saying, they're not running anything.
[02:15:03.688 --> 02:15:06.410]  I was saying, specifically though, they act like gangsters.
[02:15:06.430 --> 02:15:15.016]  It's pathetic to say that somebody who served in the IDF and has not served in the United States Army happens to be of dual loyalty.
[02:15:15.216 --> 02:15:20.840]  And I've said before, I do not approve of American Jews having two passports.
[02:15:21.311 --> 02:15:25.253]  You either have one American passport or one Israeli passport.
[02:15:25.293 --> 02:15:26.394]  You cannot have two.
[02:15:26.894 --> 02:15:31.997]  If you have an Israeli passport, then go to Israel, serve Israel, but don't come and use our country.
[02:15:32.518 --> 02:15:34.119]  Bibi had two passports.
[02:15:34.759 --> 02:15:38.761]  He took advantage of the education we gave him here all the way through MIT.
[02:15:39.242 --> 02:15:44.905]  Then he came back and had the insolence to insult us, to demand things from us.
[02:15:45.085 --> 02:15:47.487]  Israel has no right to demand anything from us.
[02:15:48.368 --> 02:15:50.989]  It may be our ally, but it's not our best ally.
[02:15:51.369 --> 02:15:53.689]  There are many other countries who've been close to us.
[02:15:54.449 --> 02:16:00.451]  Israel has been a little child who has to be spanked repeatedly and has to grow up.
[02:16:01.291 --> 02:16:02.711]  Well, I don't mean to go off on all Israel, Jack.
[02:16:02.731 --> 02:16:08.052]  I'm just saying they spew this racism crap when it's not even there, and I think it doesn't work anymore.
[02:16:08.372 --> 02:16:10.293]  What do you expect them to strike back with?
[02:16:10.333 --> 02:16:12.633]  Because they seem to have only increased their lies.
[02:16:12.953 --> 02:16:14.734]  They don't seem to have learned from this.
[02:16:14.754 --> 02:16:16.014]  Do you think that's an accurate statement?
[02:16:16.653 --> 02:16:17.273]  That's correct.
[02:16:17.433 --> 02:16:25.696]  I think what's happening is, in a revolution, when you start doing the same thing again and again, as Einstein would say, and it's not effective, it becomes stupid.
[02:16:26.357 --> 02:16:31.959]  One of the things that I said a long time ago about Hillary was she was not as bright as everybody thought.
[02:16:32.179 --> 02:16:36.420]  I don't mean in terms of just being able to spout out policy.
[02:16:36.540 --> 02:16:38.301]  She never was able to be creative.
[02:16:38.761 --> 02:16:42.403]  Initiate anything on her own and think out of the box or strategic.
[02:16:42.623 --> 02:16:48.285]  When she did, and the Democrats did, we had Libya, we had Iraq, we had Syria.
[02:16:48.345 --> 02:16:53.307]  So what you have is a lack of sophisticated intelligence on the liberal side.
[02:16:53.468 --> 02:16:56.709]  What you have is constant palaver of the same type.
[02:16:57.409 --> 02:16:59.190]  At this point, they're totally shocked.
[02:16:59.450 --> 02:17:03.432]  Everything you said about the liberals, I have encountered in my own area.
[02:17:03.972 --> 02:17:08.214]  I couldn't believe that the people wouldn't talk to me, people were afraid, they were
[02:17:08.434 --> 02:17:08.594]  Yes.
[02:17:28.217 --> 02:17:28.517]  I don't know.
[02:17:47.585 --> 02:17:48.626]  40 years.
[02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:04.280]  That's exactly right.
[02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:10.022]  And he worked all the way up from his own county, Senate, and came to the national government.
[02:18:10.382 --> 02:18:13.303]  This is not somebody who, on a whim, came in there.
[02:18:13.543 --> 02:18:16.584]  This is not a Loretta Lynch who works at Hogan & Hartson.
[02:18:17.004 --> 02:18:20.385]  This is not a James Comey who also worked at Hogan & Hartson.
[02:18:20.405 --> 02:18:23.026]  This is a gentleman who represents the South.
[02:18:23.566 --> 02:18:28.007]  Then we have Pence, the Vice President, representing Indiana.
[02:18:28.587 --> 02:18:31.628]  Then we have Mike Pompeo.
[02:18:32.228 --> 02:18:33.489]  From Kansas.
[02:18:34.789 --> 02:18:39.412]  Is America beginning to understand that Trump understands what our country's about?
[02:18:48.917 --> 02:18:51.780]  Well, for a long time, as we were talking about globalism and the President
[02:19:14.770 --> 02:19:18.314]  The very structure of interrelationship was asymmetric.
[02:19:18.975 --> 02:19:28.507]  And it was an example where if you had the EU and the EU had one printing press for 26 or 30 countries, it would not work.
[02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:31.870]  England understood this.
[02:19:32.370 --> 02:19:38.495]  England understood that the sterling, the pound, could never be attached to the EU because the euro.
[02:19:38.695 --> 02:19:52.284]  Because the EU wasn't determined by France or Germany, it was determined by a bureaucratic entity in Brussels, which was totally ineffective, had thousands of... Which had socialist ideology, but is robber baron at the same time.
[02:19:52.725 --> 02:19:55.667]  And so, again, we're seeing the global government project fail, aren't we?
[02:19:56.147 --> 02:19:57.309]  It totally is failing.
[02:19:57.489 --> 02:20:03.958]  Because England is breaking out, Spain... How did you know six years ago, it was about six years ago on the show, that it would fail?
[02:20:03.978 --> 02:20:05.821]  I mean, I wanted to believe you then, but I didn't see the evidence.
[02:20:06.402 --> 02:20:10.828]  Well, because what I look at is the initial structures of institutions.
[02:20:12.935 --> 02:20:29.409]  And when I began to see, when I was in France, I grew up in France, part of my life, when I was in France in the 80s and the Maastricht Agreement was made, I understood very quickly that if you're going to change French francs or German deutschmarks for the euro, you already failed.
[02:20:29.630 --> 02:20:29.990]  Why?
[02:20:30.150 --> 02:20:38.818]  Because Germany was so powerful that the deutschmark was in fact determining the outcome of the entire trade organization in Europe.
[02:20:39.298 --> 02:20:41.720]  And I don't think Obama understood this, Bush Jr.
[02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:42.901]  never understood it.
[02:20:43.041 --> 02:20:50.747]  Our intelligence community could understand part of it, but they couldn't understand the speed at which we had the evolution of power.
[02:20:51.168 --> 02:20:52.489]  The same thing in Washington.
[02:20:53.029 --> 02:20:58.394]  Even though Trump has come to Washington, he's really staying in his own place, and that makes sense.
[02:20:58.434 --> 02:21:04.759]  By the way, I predicted, he didn't tell me this, I predicted he'd stay at Trump Tower at the time just to have a break with the whole system.
[02:21:05.373 --> 02:21:08.395]  That's correct, and he has broken with the entire system.
[02:21:08.595 --> 02:21:13.877]  When everybody said, as if it was a joke, that he was twittering, no, he explained it very well.
[02:21:14.298 --> 02:21:18.000]  In the 21st century, if you do not use Twitter, you fail.
[02:21:18.720 --> 02:21:20.961]  He's not dumb, they're trying to take his best weapon away from him.
[02:21:21.781 --> 02:21:30.186]  He has his enemy, Leslie Stahl, in front of him saying, please give up your direct communication with the people, please let us be your intermediary, so we can betray you.
[02:21:30.956 --> 02:21:37.017]  Well, in a way, Alex, with all due respect, I don't see them as enemies because they're not that strong.
[02:21:37.097 --> 02:21:38.257]  They're not that formidable.
[02:21:38.838 --> 02:21:42.358]  When they see you, Alex Jones, as an enemy, that's formidable.
[02:21:42.638 --> 02:21:46.139]  I mean, what you have done over 14 years makes it formidable.
[02:21:46.239 --> 02:21:50.600]  And remember, it was a voice, and it was the internet that you used and created.
[02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:53.160]  And you were able to syndicate that show.
[02:21:53.320 --> 02:21:55.461]  Well, listen, I don't talk about me all day, but what do you make of...
[02:21:56.201 --> 02:21:57.665]  126 on the web now.
[02:21:58.186 --> 02:22:00.250]  Total site, 5 billion views on YouTube.
[02:22:00.691 --> 02:22:03.156]  I mean, do you think they figured out they're getting their ass kicked yet?
[02:22:04.479 --> 02:22:05.060]  They don't wanna.
[02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:06.243]  You gotta understand.
[02:22:09.276 --> 02:22:12.377]  There's a dynamic called denial, and it's not a river in Egypt.
[02:22:12.857 --> 02:22:14.838]  They want to deny what happened to them.
[02:22:16.259 --> 02:22:21.741]  How can you explain, if you're Hillary and Bill Clinton or Chelsea, how you spend $1 billion?
[02:22:21.801 --> 02:22:23.101]  That was my next question.
[02:22:23.261 --> 02:22:24.442]  She really thought she would win.
[02:22:24.562 --> 02:22:25.782]  We confirmed with our sources.
[02:22:26.043 --> 02:22:28.123]  She threw fits, attacked people, had to be sedated.
[02:22:28.624 --> 02:22:34.606]  So how was she so delusional when she was paying for fake polls, we knew it, to still think she would win?
[02:22:35.382 --> 02:22:53.017]  Well, when you live in a bubble, and this is what we were talking about for decades, you and I, she lived in a bubble where she never had to do anything on her own, never drove her car, never had to go see a doctor who was a real doctor, who could diagnose her Parkinsonism, and she was always protected by the Secret Service.
[02:22:53.097 --> 02:22:59.282]  But I want to thank certain members of the Secret Service who revealed to us that she had these diseases, even if she
[02:22:59.522 --> 02:22:59.862]  I think
[02:23:20.319 --> 02:23:22.400]  Alex, what's happening is where you're growing with
[02:23:51.226 --> 02:23:57.629]  The New York Times had a little article three or four days ago, a small article saying how their cash flows have diminished.
[02:23:58.049 --> 02:24:00.951]  Because none of the advertisers are going to go to the New York Times.
[02:24:01.051 --> 02:24:02.211]  It's down 97.
[02:24:02.311 --> 02:24:07.274]  Listen, how do they make $800 million a year and then we're bigger than them?
[02:24:07.334 --> 02:24:08.554]  Literally, online.
[02:24:08.874 --> 02:24:14.397]  Again, it's all delusional and people finally see the emperor has no clothes.
[02:24:14.797 --> 02:24:16.818]  97.5% reduction in their profits third quarter.
[02:24:17.118 --> 02:24:17.939]  They are in free fall.
[02:24:18.680 --> 02:24:20.281]  Well, they're basically bankrupt.
[02:24:20.601 --> 02:24:27.166]  What you have here is you have an entity which is basically bankrupt, but they don't want to declare the bankruptcy.
[02:24:27.627 --> 02:24:31.069]  You have a Mexican drug lord that's been funding them on the cash flows.
[02:24:31.129 --> 02:24:32.851]  You don't need reporters anymore.
[02:24:32.891 --> 02:24:33.971]  You don't need an editor.
[02:24:34.492 --> 02:24:35.593]  All of that is nonsense.
[02:24:35.753 --> 02:24:40.196]  What has happened, thanks to Infowars and Breitbart and others
[02:24:44.369 --> 02:24:44.850]  What do you mean?
[02:25:00.288 --> 02:25:01.108]  He was brilliant.
[02:25:01.348 --> 02:25:05.730]  He absolutely understood the power of the social media and the Twitter.
[02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:12.792]  Now, I studied that in 1973 at MIT when I was taught by DARPA, the Internet and Social Media.
[02:25:12.812 --> 02:25:16.173]  You and I have talked about it, where your father was involved in that.
[02:25:16.433 --> 02:25:25.756]  But in 1973, before Zuckerberg and Gates came out and self-aggrandized themselves, we were already talking about the impact of the social media on the world.
[02:25:25.916 --> 02:25:29.077]  And that was funded by DARPA and the CIA in its heyday.
[02:25:29.717 --> 02:25:37.503]  Now, you see, 50 years later, Trump literally using it, and the Democrats had no idea.
[02:25:37.523 --> 02:25:39.044]  They didn't even use it at all.
[02:25:39.365 --> 02:25:40.145]  And what did they do?
[02:25:40.205 --> 02:25:41.886]  They went exactly the old road.
[02:25:42.587 --> 02:25:43.628]  Not the road leased out.
[02:25:43.648 --> 02:25:44.749]  And they're still going the old road.
[02:25:44.769 --> 02:25:45.709]  I don't understand it.
[02:25:47.028 --> 02:25:48.108]  Because they're ignorant.
[02:25:48.268 --> 02:25:50.869]  They were ignorant, self-delusional, and arrogant.
[02:25:50.929 --> 02:25:55.810]  When you have that tripad, and you have that triad, it's a very deadly combination.
[02:25:55.890 --> 02:25:57.530]  It's basically self-destructive.
[02:25:57.990 --> 02:25:59.470]  You and I have talked about that.
[02:25:59.950 --> 02:26:02.091]  You and I have never been self-destructive.
[02:26:02.111 --> 02:26:06.231]  We've always fought, we got hit, we weren't always right, but we kept on coming back.
[02:26:06.752 --> 02:26:12.353]  Hillary was totally self-delusional, and her cult, it was really a cult group.
[02:26:12.493 --> 02:26:13.673]  I've never seen anything like this.
[02:26:13.693 --> 02:26:14.233]  It was a cult.
[02:26:15.111 --> 02:26:15.711]  It was a cult.
[02:26:15.891 --> 02:26:16.832]  It wasn't a movement.
[02:26:17.152 --> 02:26:18.713]  It wasn't a liberal movement.
[02:26:18.773 --> 02:26:20.754]  It wasn't a movement that had creativity.
[02:26:21.195 --> 02:26:28.359]  The closest person to that creativity was the person I happened to have heard a year ago in Warner, New Hampshire.
[02:26:28.379 --> 02:26:33.962]  That was Bernie Sanders, who could articulate exactly what the millennials were concerned about.
[02:26:34.382 --> 02:26:37.504]  He articulated a formula that made sense.
[02:26:37.664 --> 02:26:38.825]  Trump understood that.
[02:26:39.165 --> 02:26:40.106]  I understood that.
[02:26:40.266 --> 02:26:41.106]  You understood it.
[02:26:41.247 --> 02:26:48.551]  I wrote a blog a year ago saying that the normal opponent to Trump would have been Bernie Sanders, not Hillary Clinton.
[02:26:48.672 --> 02:26:51.253]  Sure, so they screwed up by doing that and expanding on that.
[02:26:51.273 --> 02:26:53.355]  I mean, he was getting 10 to 1, 15 to 1, by the end 20 to 1.
[02:26:55.396 --> 02:27:01.558]  Likes and traffic on Facebook and Twitter, that's always for any marketer, and they have these big algorithms, total proof.
[02:27:01.578 --> 02:27:06.960]  That's why they were panicking, but at the same time still believing they could win, because they were putting out fake polls.
[02:27:07.420 --> 02:27:11.421]  But people didn't buy the polls, so they didn't go get on the bandwagon for Hillary.
[02:27:11.461 --> 02:27:12.421]  That's where they lost it.
[02:27:13.201 --> 02:27:16.962]  They lost it also because Hillary didn't want to hear anything that she didn't want to hear.
[02:27:17.243 --> 02:27:18.583]  Alex, you and I understand
[02:27:18.723 --> 02:27:21.585]  And the old establishment hadn't figured that out yet.
[02:27:44.221 --> 02:27:52.909]  No, the intelligence community had, but what happened was she had seconded guys like Michael Hayden and others who were sycophants.
[02:27:53.469 --> 02:27:58.674]  We, in turn, went back to our own people at a lower level and said, look, we've got a problem.
[02:27:59.134 --> 02:28:00.596]  She had a civilian coup.
[02:28:00.776 --> 02:28:07.522]  Now, you have to understand what that really meant for my own people, my own people being military intelligence, civilian intelligence.
[02:28:07.902 --> 02:28:16.614]  And all across the board, they understood right away when Hillary and Bill had co-opted Comey, Loretta Lynch, the FBI, the CIA.
[02:28:16.674 --> 02:28:18.056]  She was setting up something really dangerous.
[02:28:18.076 --> 02:28:18.817]  She had to be dealt with.
[02:28:19.818 --> 02:28:20.700]  There was no question.
[02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:25.486]  And the minute that occurred, and I gotta go ahead, that meant we ran a counter
[02:28:28.055 --> 02:28:32.416]  How could he not pardon Snowden or give Assange asylum here when these are the guys that got him elected?
[02:28:47.156 --> 02:28:48.697]  Snowden is a separate issue.
[02:28:48.757 --> 02:28:49.817]  I have to differ with that.
[02:28:49.937 --> 02:28:51.998]  Snowden was part of the CIA.
[02:28:52.098 --> 02:28:53.418]  He was part of the NSA.
[02:28:53.958 --> 02:28:58.120]  Snowden had a top secret clearance and then special access program.
[02:28:58.240 --> 02:28:59.880]  It's a very sensitive issue.
[02:29:00.440 --> 02:29:11.064]  When you are part of an organization like Daniel Ellsberg and you suddenly become what they call a whistleblower, I'm very, very mistrustful of who you are and who you represent.
[02:29:11.104 --> 02:29:12.344]  You think it might be a double or triple agent?
[02:29:12.364 --> 02:29:13.785]  Snowden doesn't just represent
[02:29:13.925 --> 02:29:14.645]  We're good to go.
[02:29:33.459 --> 02:29:34.540]  And he should be tried.
[02:29:34.560 --> 02:29:35.541]  And see what happens.
[02:29:35.561 --> 02:29:37.143]  But as for Assange, he should be given an award.
[02:29:37.203 --> 02:29:37.724]  All right, Doc.
[02:29:37.844 --> 02:29:38.024]  Yes.
[02:29:38.345 --> 02:29:40.847]  Folks, you can find your book, Steve McShinnick Talks, at SteveMcShinnick.com.
[02:29:40.907 --> 02:29:41.488]  Always interesting.
[02:29:41.548 --> 02:29:43.090]  Thank you for your audience, Alex.
[02:29:43.410 --> 02:29:44.832]  We couldn't have done it without you.
[02:29:44.852 --> 02:29:45.432]  They're the ones.
[02:29:45.593 --> 02:29:46.133]  It's incredible.
[02:29:46.153 --> 02:29:47.254]  And we're still not out of the woods yet.
[02:29:47.295 --> 02:29:49.377]  But I tell you, we're in the fight, and that's most of the battle.
[02:29:49.417 --> 02:29:49.857]  Thank you, Doc.
[02:29:50.178 --> 02:29:53.081]  We'll be back with your phone calls and more straight ahead.
[02:29:53.141 --> 02:29:54.242]  This is the InfoWars.
[02:29:54.262 --> 02:29:54.663]  Stay with us.
[02:29:59.071 --> 02:30:02.054]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.995 --> 02:30:05.658]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.385 --> 02:30:20.914]  If you ever wanted to live off the grid and produce your own clean energy in a silent, reliable way, this is a message you want to pay very close attention to.
[02:30:21.254 --> 02:30:31.903]  Thanks to a new development in solar generator technology, it's now possible for my listeners and viewers to produce their own source of emergency backup electricity.
[02:30:32.303 --> 02:30:35.266]  And even more importantly, it's now extremely affordable.
[02:30:35.686 --> 02:30:43.012]  Thanks to the guys at Solutions for Science, you can get one of these $6,000 solar generators for less than $1,500.
[02:30:44.073 --> 02:30:46.415]  We have these units at the office and at my home.
[02:30:46.756 --> 02:30:52.160]  I can run my sump pumps, my shortwave radios, all of my devices, and even keep our food from spoiling.
[02:30:52.541 --> 02:30:57.345]  Go to powergridchaos.com and get 70% off for a limited time.
[02:30:57.745 --> 02:31:01.467]  Folks, there has never been a better time to get off the grid.
[02:31:01.807 --> 02:31:06.110]  It's going to be crucial in 2017, maybe even life-saving.
[02:31:06.430 --> 02:31:09.952]  Powergridchaos.com for 70% off.
[02:31:10.332 --> 02:31:12.274]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[02:31:12.294 --> 02:31:13.374]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:31:13.634 --> 02:31:14.515]  Why is this so good?
[02:31:14.835 --> 02:31:20.078]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:31:20.158 --> 02:31:33.705]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:31:33.765 --> 02:31:40.069]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:31:40.169 --> 02:31:41.430]  These are all parasites.
[02:31:41.490 --> 02:31:42.570]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:31:42.590 --> 02:31:43.631]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:31:43.931 --> 02:31:48.254]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:31:48.454 --> 02:31:51.617]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:31:51.637 --> 02:31:54.799]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:31:54.839 --> 02:31:55.839]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:31:55.880 --> 02:31:57.761]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:57.821 --> 02:31:58.842]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:31:58.862 --> 02:32:00.923]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:32:01.584 --> 02:32:03.445]  And you support the broadcast.
[02:32:03.505 --> 02:32:04.586]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:04.846 --> 02:32:06.747]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:32:07.127 --> 02:32:09.089]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:32:11.397 --> 02:32:16.099]  Donald Trump is moving fast to build his new administration, making many key appointments thus far.
[02:32:16.480 --> 02:32:19.041]  President-elect Trump has named the following appointments.
[02:32:19.661 --> 02:32:22.643]  Senator from Alabama, Jeff Sessions, Attorney General.
[02:32:23.023 --> 02:32:26.445]  Representative from Kansas, Mike Pompeo, Head of CIA.
[02:32:26.805 --> 02:32:30.867]  Former Military Intelligence Chief, Michael Flynn, National Security Advisor.
[02:32:31.227 --> 02:32:34.069]  Media Executive Stephen Bannon, Chief Strategist.
[02:32:34.430 --> 02:32:38.493]  Chairman Republican National Committee Reince Priebus, White House Chief of Staff.
[02:32:38.953 --> 02:32:44.957]  Trump has also created a short list of possible appointees for other key spots, including a new Supreme Court Justice.
[02:32:45.378 --> 02:32:49.601]  Rumors are swirling that there may be a position for his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway.
[02:32:49.921 --> 02:32:57.049]  Former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani and even detractor Mitt Romney is being tossed around as a possible Secretary of State.
[02:32:57.430 --> 02:33:02.075]  While former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has said he will not be in a Trump administration.
[02:33:02.635 --> 02:33:03.356]  I'm Owen Troyer.
[02:33:03.556 --> 02:33:05.258]  For more go to InfoWars.com
[02:33:23.166 --> 02:33:29.888]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:30.629 --> 02:33:35.790]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:40.092 --> 02:33:40.972]  Just keep a-comin'.
[02:33:41.732 --> 02:33:42.833]  Keep your head up to me.
[02:33:46.634 --> 02:33:47.674]  Monday through Friday.
[02:33:49.455 --> 02:33:50.856]  We're here live 11 a.m.
[02:33:50.876 --> 02:33:51.276]  to 3 p.m.
[02:33:51.316 --> 02:33:51.656]  Central.
[02:33:53.052 --> 02:33:55.093]  We're here to make the mainstream media burn!
[02:33:56.093 --> 02:33:57.773]  We're gonna burn them down with truth!
[02:33:58.794 --> 02:33:59.994]  We're gonna pull the trigger!
[02:34:00.014 --> 02:34:00.994]  Ha ha!
[02:34:01.014 --> 02:34:02.715]  You like that?
[02:34:05.455 --> 02:34:08.116]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna go to your phone calls here in just a second.
[02:34:09.736 --> 02:34:12.537]  I've done this myself, looking for racism of Stephen Bannon.
[02:34:12.557 --> 02:34:13.697]  I don't just go out and defend him.
[02:34:14.157 --> 02:34:15.538]  I'm gonna try to find stuff I've said.
[02:34:16.414 --> 02:34:19.377]  And then they'll always take it out of context and like literally twist it.
[02:34:19.397 --> 02:34:22.379]  It's like yesterday I said, I don't know what happened at Sandy Hook.
[02:34:22.900 --> 02:34:26.663]  They take me out of context where I say, I could see how it was actors and stage.
[02:34:26.683 --> 02:34:27.604]  They have green screen.
[02:34:27.985 --> 02:34:29.206]  They've staged so much other stuff.
[02:34:29.246 --> 02:34:30.127]  It just doesn't make sense.
[02:34:30.167 --> 02:34:31.368]  I guess the whole thing could be fake.
[02:34:31.688 --> 02:34:35.752]  People are, I was talking about people criticizing me for saying at least part of it was real.
[02:34:37.093 --> 02:34:43.120]  And they've been caught with real events having actors to then try to squeeze as much emotion out of it as they can.
[02:34:43.140 --> 02:34:46.284]  CNN just got caught last week with fake interviews.
[02:34:48.305 --> 02:34:54.790]  And they take a complex thought like that, where I'm really trying to tell people what I think, and you're like, looking into your brain, saying, how do you describe this?
[02:34:54.810 --> 02:34:56.292]  Because it's complex.
[02:34:56.352 --> 02:34:56.912]  I don't know.
[02:34:57.292 --> 02:35:09.403]  Usually I know, and so I can be definitive, but when I don't know, I'm like, well, I look at it on this side, look at it on that side, and I feel sorry for the parents of the kids, and I know there were school shootings, and it's terrible, so...
[02:35:10.578 --> 02:35:11.878]  And then the media thinks they've got me.
[02:35:12.098 --> 02:35:14.899]  Oh, he backed, they had a New York Daily News article today, a bunch of others.
[02:35:15.499 --> 02:35:18.580]  Alex Jones comes in and says he doesn't believe Sandy Hook was staged.
[02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:20.780]  And then one minute later, contradicts himself.
[02:35:21.080 --> 02:35:21.600]  No, I didn't.
[02:35:23.281 --> 02:35:24.481]  I was very clear, just like I just was.
[02:35:25.641 --> 02:35:28.042]  The whole official story is very convoluted.
[02:35:28.082 --> 02:35:29.002]  A lot of it doesn't add up.
[02:35:29.462 --> 02:35:31.863]  And a media that's been caught lying so much is running it.
[02:35:31.923 --> 02:35:33.223]  So how do I believe anything?
[02:35:34.803 --> 02:35:37.484]  I could have a neighbor that's lied to me 50 times, who I know is a criminal.
[02:35:38.439 --> 02:35:41.461]  And they come and tell me, oh hey, come home, your house is on fire.
[02:35:41.842 --> 02:35:42.682]  I'm not going to believe them.
[02:35:42.983 --> 02:35:44.744]  Even if the house is on fire is what I'm saying.
[02:35:47.006 --> 02:35:48.587]  So they play these games, you see.
[02:35:49.187 --> 02:35:49.948]  They play these games.
[02:35:50.889 --> 02:35:52.650]  And they can take anything and turn it around.
[02:35:52.690 --> 02:35:55.332]  Like, I do not believe a Jewish conspiracy runs the world.
[02:35:56.553 --> 02:36:02.518]  But there are a lot of criminals that happen to be Jewish that hide behind anti-Semitism claims like
[02:36:04.363 --> 02:36:05.864]  The Mayor of Chicago.
[02:36:06.364 --> 02:36:10.707]  There's Irish Mafia, there's Italian Mafia, there's Jewish Mafia, there's Dixie Mafia.
[02:36:11.007 --> 02:36:11.828]  They're all bad.
[02:36:11.848 --> 02:36:16.751]  We don't have one Mafia running the world, but I think the Emanuels and Obama are like a Mafia.
[02:36:17.071 --> 02:36:17.672]  Oh my God!
[02:36:17.712 --> 02:36:18.592]  Jews run the world!
[02:36:18.692 --> 02:36:19.573]  Alex Jones said it!
[02:36:19.613 --> 02:36:20.133]  Oh my God!
[02:36:20.193 --> 02:36:21.674]  And he's Jerusalem Post!
[02:36:22.234 --> 02:36:25.957]  And you read these cut-off quotes all cobbled together, it's like, man!
[02:36:26.437 --> 02:36:28.939]  There's a reason people don't believe you or listen to you.
[02:36:31.761 --> 02:36:32.261]  It's crazy.
[02:36:35.131 --> 02:36:38.252]  Rob Jacobson's Jewish, a great friend of mine, the oldest employee at this company.
[02:36:39.033 --> 02:36:45.976]  He tells a story growing up in Brooklyn, where some of the Hasidic Jews, I found them to be great folks, but he said some of them were really obnoxious.
[02:36:46.356 --> 02:36:51.539]  He's Jewish, he's allowed to say this, would come up and say, you need to come to our meeting, or you need to do this, you need to be in this business deal.
[02:36:51.739 --> 02:36:53.860]  And when he wouldn't agree, they'd go, oh, you don't like Jews!
[02:36:54.100 --> 02:36:56.501]  And like, sit there and peck at him, and you know, mess with him.
[02:36:56.521 --> 02:36:58.902]  You know, it's just crazy, folks.
[02:36:58.982 --> 02:37:00.743]  I don't like white supremacists, I don't like
[02:37:01.818 --> 02:37:02.979]  You know, Jewish mafia.
[02:37:03.039 --> 02:37:05.520]  I just don't like criminal groups, and every group's got it.
[02:37:06.180 --> 02:37:07.381]  Let's stop lying about it.
[02:37:08.041 --> 02:37:15.565]  I can take you all over the place and find toothless white people that are the dumbest people you can imagine, who hate everybody, including their neighbors.
[02:37:15.945 --> 02:37:20.267]  All they got is running around going, I don't like the Mexicans, I don't like the N-word.
[02:37:20.807 --> 02:37:22.588]  Those people are jackasses!
[02:37:22.889 --> 02:37:23.549]  They're jokes!
[02:37:23.569 --> 02:37:24.869]  You know, my dad corrected me last week.
[02:37:24.889 --> 02:37:25.310]  He said, you know,
[02:37:26.186 --> 02:37:32.468]  You're talking about my dad, who ran for office as a Republican, and who was loved by the black folks and things, and who stood up to the Klan and had the Klan threaten him.
[02:37:32.488 --> 02:37:33.648]  He goes, they weren't that threatening.
[02:37:33.668 --> 02:37:35.009]  They were a bunch of goobers and wimps.
[02:37:35.089 --> 02:37:38.930]  I mean, he did stand up to them, and they did threaten him, but he goes, you know, it wasn't like it was that scary.
[02:37:38.950 --> 02:37:46.853]  And I said, well, of course, you know, your dad was a badass, and he had the people behind him, but they still did threaten him, because I've been threatened over him myself in East Texas.
[02:37:48.220 --> 02:37:49.041]  But I mean, that's what I mean.
[02:37:49.081 --> 02:37:51.823]  Like, my family has literally fought the KKK.
[02:37:52.243 --> 02:37:55.305]  And I get to sit there and have dumbasses tell me I'm with the KKK.
[02:37:55.725 --> 02:37:57.887]  With a bunch of pot-bellied dumbasses?
[02:37:59.548 --> 02:38:01.649]  Who want to run around acting like they're in some cool club?
[02:38:02.250 --> 02:38:03.811]  I've been invited to the inauguration!
[02:38:04.471 --> 02:38:05.492]  And don't even want to go to that.
[02:38:05.852 --> 02:38:07.854]  I'm going to be out in the street fighting the demonstrators.
[02:38:08.314 --> 02:38:08.915]  Exposing them.
[02:38:09.175 --> 02:38:09.855]  That's where I am.
[02:38:11.616 --> 02:38:13.658]  Anybody figured out yet I don't want to be in anybody's club?
[02:38:14.038 --> 02:38:14.779]  I'm not in anybody's club.
[02:38:15.427 --> 02:38:17.668]  I don't care if you're black, white, woman, man.
[02:38:18.108 --> 02:38:19.549]  As long as you're cool, I like you.
[02:38:19.769 --> 02:38:21.589]  If you're an a-hole, I don't like you.
[02:38:21.609 --> 02:38:22.410]  I don't want to go to your phone calls.
[02:38:22.450 --> 02:38:26.591]  It's just... I'm back there and Matt, one of the producers, is going, yeah, look at this article.
[02:38:26.611 --> 02:38:27.271]  He's got a BuzzFeed.
[02:38:27.291 --> 02:38:38.195]  They admit, here's Bannon over a year ago, talking about how we're trying to wash out racism in the libertarian right-wing movement and how we want to get everybody, including minorities, involved.
[02:38:38.615 --> 02:38:39.576]  That's what I'm trying to do.
[02:38:39.856 --> 02:38:42.837]  That's why the white supremacists hate me more than Benjamin Netanyahu.
[02:38:46.334 --> 02:38:50.397]  A world where he said racism on the far right gets washed out.
[02:38:54.161 --> 02:38:55.602]  And yeah, he called Putin a kleptocrat.
[02:38:55.662 --> 02:38:56.382]  He doesn't like Putin.
[02:38:56.703 --> 02:38:57.563]  It's a diverse group.
[02:38:57.623 --> 02:39:01.647]  The point is that I'm not even sitting here saying Stephen Bannon's perfect.
[02:39:01.887 --> 02:39:03.028]  They just misrepresent.
[02:39:03.288 --> 02:39:07.652]  They say he's an anti-Semite when Breitbart's basically a pro-Israel outfit.
[02:39:07.672 --> 02:39:08.793]  This is just horse crap.
[02:39:10.533 --> 02:39:17.941]  It's all, and I'm not even here defending it because, oh, you're getting us, oh, you're on target, oh, I better defend, it's, you're a joke!
[02:39:18.561 --> 02:39:22.065]  Infowars has never been about race garbage, except for exposing it.
[02:39:22.526 --> 02:39:32.195]  If you Google Alex Jones, Jewish agent or whatever, you'll just get, I mean, literally, you go to the Nazi websites, folks, they hate me more than anybody on earth.
[02:39:33.137 --> 02:39:33.678]  And you know why?
[02:39:33.838 --> 02:39:41.887]  It's because I just want everybody to have freedom, and I want to win the culture war, where no matter what color you are, you're in the free market, the Second Amendment, and freedom.
[02:39:41.907 --> 02:39:48.876]  I don't care what color you are, we can ride around in jacked-up monster trucks, drinking beer, and shooting fully automatic weapons.
[02:39:48.916 --> 02:39:52.300]  I mean, you know, I just am not a creep, folks.
[02:39:54.386 --> 02:39:55.747]  I get there's an anti-white agenda.
[02:39:55.807 --> 02:39:56.588]  God, there is one.
[02:39:56.748 --> 02:40:01.811]  But that's what the system sells because racism is successful with dumb people.
[02:40:02.131 --> 02:40:04.613]  And there's no shortage of dumb people regardless of skin color.
[02:40:07.855 --> 02:40:12.839]  But if you Google and just go look at what the white supremacists... I found out the white supremacists are a bunch of feds.
[02:40:13.279 --> 02:40:14.780]  They're a bunch of Southern Poverty Law Center people.
[02:40:17.543 --> 02:40:22.987]  I'm gonna tell you right now, eight times out of ten from our research, white supremacist leaders work for the big foundations.
[02:40:23.047 --> 02:40:25.228]  Ford Foundation, Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:40:25.488 --> 02:40:29.751]  It's not like they've infiltrated these groups so they can control them and, you know, see what they're doing.
[02:40:29.811 --> 02:40:30.732]  They create them.
[02:40:31.352 --> 02:40:32.193]  They create them.
[02:40:36.396 --> 02:40:37.376]  They're gang members, folks.
[02:40:38.417 --> 02:40:38.997]  That's all it is.
[02:40:39.037 --> 02:40:39.898]  It's gang crap.
[02:40:39.918 --> 02:40:42.079]  Like, oh, you got a blue bandana, you got a red bandana.
[02:40:42.460 --> 02:40:44.421]  It's all this crap and
[02:40:45.902 --> 02:40:46.822]  I personally am sick of it.
[02:40:46.842 --> 02:40:58.226]  You know, I've got a bunch of clips here to play and I'm going to put a Sandy Hook special out tonight on the nightly news that Rob News has been working on because they just keep bringing up this Sandy Hook and bringing up a mother, bringing up a sister, bringing up, you know, all this crap.
[02:40:58.386 --> 02:41:01.647]  All I know is Anderson Cooper was there and he turned his head and he was on a freaking green screen.
[02:41:04.748 --> 02:41:10.250]  And he got caught with other fake reporters interviewing each other, supposedly on satellite, and it wasn't even on satellite.
[02:41:10.870 --> 02:41:12.431]  I mean, I don't know what was going on there.
[02:41:12.511 --> 02:41:14.752]  I'm explaining to you again, but it's as phony as a $3 bill.
[02:41:17.947 --> 02:41:29.672]  Now when I'm decisive, and I've got hundreds of polls that were done privately, showing Trump way ahead, and I told you he was going to win, it's because I have the facts.
[02:41:32.273 --> 02:41:34.494]  The only thing I've got is my credibility.
[02:41:34.514 --> 02:41:37.875]  And by the way, credibility doesn't mean the way I present information.
[02:41:38.035 --> 02:41:39.896]  Oh, Alex Jones yells and screams sometimes.
[02:41:40.536 --> 02:41:42.217]  Absa-fricking-lutely, because I'm real.
[02:41:43.336 --> 02:41:47.840]  But when it gets down to information, man, I'm not going to lie to you because of my integrity.
[02:41:48.180 --> 02:41:52.124]  My most valued possession is that who I am is right here on my sleeve.
[02:41:53.045 --> 02:41:54.646]  Like this is AJ right there on my shirt.
[02:41:55.166 --> 02:41:55.667]  That's who I am.
[02:41:55.947 --> 02:41:57.408]  My integrity is right here.
[02:41:57.949 --> 02:41:59.130]  That's all I got right there, folks.
[02:41:59.150 --> 02:41:59.510]  You see that?
[02:41:59.810 --> 02:42:00.391]  That's all I got.
[02:42:01.612 --> 02:42:04.134]  And this world's going to get a lot better when people start living like that.
[02:42:09.339 --> 02:42:09.479]  Now,
[02:42:11.530 --> 02:42:12.750]  Talk about not having integrity.
[02:42:12.850 --> 02:42:13.930]  Look at de Blasio.
[02:42:14.050 --> 02:42:16.311]  I mean, I looked at photos of him this morning for like five minutes.
[02:42:16.771 --> 02:42:19.572]  He just looks like a sack of crap, the New York mayor.
[02:42:19.912 --> 02:42:22.532]  I wouldn't eat dinner with him, but I saw him trying to sell me a car.
[02:42:22.932 --> 02:42:23.572]  I wouldn't walk.
[02:42:23.692 --> 02:42:25.033]  I'd run off the lot.
[02:42:27.593 --> 02:42:28.273]  De Blasio.
[02:42:29.994 --> 02:42:36.495]  You look at him with his creepy staff of creepy manipulators that think, ooh, racism is really effective.
[02:42:36.515 --> 02:42:37.615]  Yeah, nobody ever thought of that before.
[02:42:38.609 --> 02:42:40.150]  Nobody ever thought to use that before, tribalism.
[02:42:40.230 --> 02:42:41.752]  Oh my god, you're just, you're so smart.
[02:42:41.772 --> 02:42:42.553]  You're such a genius.
[02:42:42.893 --> 02:42:45.015]  Why don't you try with the West and try to phase this crap out?
[02:42:45.435 --> 02:42:52.021]  No, instead you claim you're the West phasing it out when you're the ones bringing it back with these jackass employees saying, F white people.
[02:42:52.682 --> 02:43:03.732]  What the hell are you doing in your white red clothes, in your fancy mansions you live in, in your big 5th Avenue palaces, sitting there running around with black people on the street trying to turn them into racists?
[02:43:04.232 --> 02:43:06.833]  The good news is, every black person I know sees right through this crap.
[02:43:07.093 --> 02:43:11.075]  How obvious is it that some cracker ass sits there with an F-whiteness sign?
[02:43:11.336 --> 02:43:12.336]  Nobody likes a traitor.
[02:43:12.576 --> 02:43:13.597]  What the hell is your problem?
[02:43:13.837 --> 02:43:15.418]  And by the way, you're not a traitor if you're saying F-whites.
[02:43:15.658 --> 02:43:18.079]  You're a traitor because you're a traitor against your species.
[02:43:18.599 --> 02:43:21.981]  I mean, the mayor of New York is a disgusting embarrassment.
[02:43:22.481 --> 02:43:25.262]  I have figured, it's not hatred I have, it's not even disgust.
[02:43:25.843 --> 02:43:28.604]  I feel low that you're associated with me as a human.
[02:43:29.785 --> 02:43:30.905]  I'm ashamed of you.
[02:43:31.686 --> 02:43:32.126]  I really am.
[02:43:33.507 --> 02:43:35.988]  I looked at, Googled Mayor de Blasio and clicked photos of him.
[02:43:36.208 --> 02:43:39.468]  The creepy fake smile, looks like, looks like Jerry Sandusky.
[02:43:39.508 --> 02:43:43.829]  I'm sorry, he just looks like a big, fat, leering piranha head.
[02:43:43.929 --> 02:43:46.490]  I mean, just my very cells go, UGH!
[02:43:46.630 --> 02:43:47.110]  God!
[02:43:47.310 --> 02:43:47.610]  Evil!
[02:43:48.010 --> 02:43:48.170]  UGH!
[02:43:48.270 --> 02:43:48.570]  Fake!
[02:43:49.050 --> 02:43:50.031]  Just UGH!
[02:43:50.071 --> 02:43:50.811]  Get away from me!
[02:43:52.331 --> 02:43:57.912]  And I'm not saying he's... I mean, look at that guy.
[02:43:58.593 --> 02:43:59.513]  Look at that.
[02:44:00.646 --> 02:44:05.810]  Look, I mean, ladies and gentlemen, we have the next contestant for American Psycho.
[02:44:06.891 --> 02:44:09.593]  A race-pimping sack of crap.
[02:44:10.734 --> 02:44:13.216]  An enemy of everything decent de Blasio.
[02:44:13.977 --> 02:44:15.037]  Just look at him.
[02:44:15.658 --> 02:44:17.900]  Out there with his staff saying, F white people.
[02:44:18.680 --> 02:44:20.262]  You're an effing white male, dude.
[02:44:20.462 --> 02:44:22.003]  What is your freaking problem, dude?
[02:44:23.364 --> 02:44:26.947]  I bet money that son of a piece of trash, absolutely,
[02:44:28.427 --> 02:44:29.948]  Was born in a porta potty at midnight.
[02:44:30.369 --> 02:44:34.792]  And I bet you money that he doesn't give any money to people.
[02:44:34.912 --> 02:44:37.374]  And he absolutely hates his constituents.
[02:44:37.454 --> 02:44:38.855]  I mean, look at that guy.
[02:44:39.355 --> 02:44:39.876]  Look at that.
[02:44:39.916 --> 02:44:41.217]  Look how he thinks he's God.
[02:44:41.477 --> 02:44:42.538]  He thinks he's invincible.
[02:44:42.738 --> 02:44:44.079]  He thinks he's smarter than you.
[02:44:44.199 --> 02:44:46.321]  No, you're lower than we are.
[02:44:46.361 --> 02:44:46.721]  We won't.
[02:44:47.041 --> 02:44:49.023]  We don't think like you rat head.
[02:44:51.561 --> 02:44:56.325]  A big white guy shows up saying F white people to black rallies?
[02:44:56.345 --> 02:44:58.467]  I mean, what kind of hell crap is this?
[02:44:58.587 --> 02:44:59.948]  What the hell's your problem, man?
[02:45:00.748 --> 02:45:01.309]  What the hell?
[02:45:02.490 --> 02:45:05.572]  What if a black guy showed up at some meeting saying F black people?
[02:45:05.592 --> 02:45:06.853]  I mean, what the hell's your problem?
[02:45:06.993 --> 02:45:07.874]  Get the hell out of here!
[02:45:11.376 --> 02:45:12.977]  Don't you think we see you, punk?
[02:45:14.298 --> 02:45:15.900]  De Blasio, I see you, man.
[02:45:17.741 --> 02:45:18.862]  You changed your name.
[02:45:21.721 --> 02:45:22.741]  Everything about you is fake.
[02:45:25.783 --> 02:45:27.944]  He thought Wilhelms sounded too white.
[02:45:32.505 --> 02:45:33.986]  These are insecure people, folks.
[02:45:37.452 --> 02:45:39.954]  I want to go to your phone calls briefly because I haven't plugged anything today hardly.

[02:45:56.126 --> 02:45:58.548]  Solutions for Science has a moving warehouse sale.

[02:46:34.532 --> 02:46:37.735]  I'm reminding myself to take one of those little babies right now.
[02:46:38.736 --> 02:46:41.499]  But to InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsTore.com, or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[02:46:44.130 --> 02:46:47.231]  And by the way, we're really good at dominating in media and we're not good at making money.
[02:46:47.251 --> 02:46:49.032]  People are like, wow, you got this big organization.
[02:46:49.332 --> 02:46:57.035]  Yeah, with billions of YouTube viewers a year and hundreds of millions of radio listeners a year, you'd think we had a 126 website in the world, you'd think.
[02:46:57.635 --> 02:46:58.415]  No, we're not.
[02:46:58.636 --> 02:47:00.716]  I'm not bitching anybody because I'm the one that runs this operation.
[02:47:00.956 --> 02:47:01.917]  We're really good at
[02:47:02.972 --> 02:47:03.513]  Reaching people.
[02:47:03.553 --> 02:47:05.296]  We're not good at bringing in the cashola.
[02:47:05.716 --> 02:47:08.741]  We don't have any Mexican kingpins, you know, funding us like New York Times.
[02:47:08.781 --> 02:47:11.325]  So, we're bigger than New York Times, if you didn't hear.
[02:47:11.345 --> 02:47:13.949]  That's why they're in a... Oh my God, you're in the New York Times?
[02:47:14.069 --> 02:47:15.231]  Oh my God, did you read it?
[02:47:15.311 --> 02:47:16.433]  No, I didn't read the article.
[02:47:19.060 --> 02:47:20.121]  I'm like, are you human?
[02:47:20.421 --> 02:47:21.542]  Am I a prop for the story?
[02:47:22.222 --> 02:47:23.143]  You know, do you understand?
[02:47:23.223 --> 02:47:26.645]  I mean, I just, I'm talking to him like, we come to your planet in peace.
[02:47:26.685 --> 02:47:27.865]  We do not wish to have war with you.
[02:47:27.885 --> 02:47:30.267]  I'm not even like, it's just ridiculous.
[02:47:30.307 --> 02:47:30.627]  All this.
[02:47:30.747 --> 02:47:32.088]  Oh my God, the New York Times.
[02:47:32.168 --> 02:47:32.928]  Oh my God.
[02:47:32.948 --> 02:47:33.709]  Oh my God.
[02:47:33.729 --> 02:47:34.749]  Oh my God.
[02:47:34.770 --> 02:47:37.751]  I don't care if a shirt's from Target or Neiman Marcus if I like it.
[02:47:37.831 --> 02:47:39.933]  I'm not into all this classism crap.
[02:47:40.313 --> 02:47:41.934]  I like a boat because I want to be on the water.
[02:47:42.114 --> 02:47:43.795]  I like a fast car because I like a fast car.
[02:47:44.035 --> 02:47:45.156]  Not so you look at me in a red light.
[02:47:46.010 --> 02:47:47.911]  I'm just so sick of all the fake people, man.
[02:47:47.951 --> 02:47:48.952]  I can't handle it anymore.
[02:47:48.972 --> 02:47:53.814]  I look at de Blasio and I'm like, maybe our species isn't good.
[02:47:53.955 --> 02:47:54.895]  Look at this guy.
[02:47:55.575 --> 02:47:59.718]  He's got to look like he just, you know, pumped the neighbor's dog or something.
[02:47:59.758 --> 02:48:00.438]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:48:00.458 --> 02:48:06.382]  It's an absolute fraud on humanity, a disgrace, an abomination.
[02:48:09.603 --> 02:48:10.064]  They are.
[02:48:10.084 --> 02:48:11.504]  I just can't help it.
[02:48:12.245 --> 02:48:13.586]  Johnny in Kansas, you're on the air.
[02:48:13.606 --> 02:48:13.926]  Go ahead.
[02:48:16.625 --> 02:48:18.086]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:48:18.106 --> 02:48:18.706]  Thank you, Johnny.
[02:48:18.726 --> 02:48:21.608]  We're not in Kansas anymore, are we?
[02:48:21.728 --> 02:48:23.148]  I have been there for a long time.
[02:48:23.889 --> 02:48:32.213]  Hey, there are several initiatives we've got running out here, but I want to point out to everybody that Trump is not a savior.
[02:48:32.833 --> 02:48:34.534]  Matter of fact, there ain't no saviors out there.
[02:48:34.594 --> 02:48:35.695]  We have to save ourselves.
[02:48:36.735 --> 02:48:39.097]  So it takes us to get involved in this thing.
[02:48:39.917 --> 02:48:43.739]  Grab the reins up and start leading this horse in the direction you want to go.
[02:48:45.390 --> 02:48:49.691]  I agree, we've all got to reach out, basically adopt brainwashed liberals.
[02:48:49.711 --> 02:48:51.071]  I've heard there's a national movement to do that.
[02:48:51.432 --> 02:48:59.334]  We should all go out and adopt one of these poor zombies, take them out shooting, feed them barbecue, pat them on the back, let them, you know, it's just all crazy.
[02:49:00.394 --> 02:49:00.994]  Absolutely.
[02:49:01.614 --> 02:49:08.076]  And there's an initiative, surely you've heard about the greatagain.gov website that Trump set up.
[02:49:08.496 --> 02:49:10.036]  Yeah, let's put that on screen, I love it.
[02:49:10.076 --> 02:49:10.516]  Here, go ahead.
[02:49:10.757 --> 02:49:11.677]  Imagine, greatagain.gov.
[02:49:13.624 --> 02:49:17.625]  It's an awesome outreach that'll go all the way down.
[02:49:17.665 --> 02:49:22.646]  You know, if you can get on your smartphone and get there, of course, it's kind of hard to read and type on that smartphone.
[02:49:22.666 --> 02:49:24.067]  Sure, well, what should we look at on the site?
[02:49:24.087 --> 02:49:26.127]  We're on the site right now.
[02:49:26.327 --> 02:49:33.950]  Well, we've got an initiative moving forward to try to get Chris Ann Hall to be a constitutional scholar for Trump.
[02:49:34.570 --> 02:49:39.031]  Some kind of an education for the people in the services and the
[02:49:39.867 --> 02:49:48.089]  Well, I think they're starting to get it now.
[02:49:48.109 --> 02:49:48.909]  I hear you.
[02:49:48.929 --> 02:49:49.669]  I appreciate your call.
[02:49:49.689 --> 02:49:50.489]  Good to hear from you, Johnny.
[02:49:51.069 --> 02:49:53.890]  All right, let's talk to Nick in Connecticut.
[02:49:53.930 --> 02:49:56.970]  Yes, Trump did visit a goblin.
[02:49:57.010 --> 02:49:58.031]  He didn't kiss a goblin.
[02:49:58.051 --> 02:49:59.291]  He didn't get in bed with a goblin.
[02:49:59.311 --> 02:50:01.411]  He didn't marry a goblin or have babies with a goblin.
[02:50:01.431 --> 02:50:04.272]  But Trump did meet with an actual goblin yesterday.
[02:50:04.312 --> 02:50:04.572]  Go ahead.
[02:50:05.865 --> 02:50:06.826]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:50:07.686 --> 02:50:14.151]  What I wanted to talk about real quick was, you know, I'm real hopeful for, you know, the possibility that we're actually going to be able to take back our republic.
[02:50:14.911 --> 02:50:22.677]  But I want to know your take on, first of all, Trump considering Romney for Secretary of State, and second of all, the recent meeting he had at Trump Tower with Kissinger.
[02:50:22.797 --> 02:50:30.442]  And I saw on my local Fox affiliate that he possibly is being considered as a cabinet member in Trump's administration.
[02:50:30.623 --> 02:50:31.043]  Kissinger?
[02:50:33.059 --> 02:50:33.660]  Yes.
[02:50:34.060 --> 02:50:35.661]  I don't think that's not happening.
[02:50:36.281 --> 02:50:42.484]  Trump's just patting all these evil people on the head, hoping they just fade off and aren't butt hurt, so he's giving them face-saving measures.
[02:50:42.944 --> 02:50:45.185]  I don't like the Romney idea, but he's better than some.
[02:50:45.645 --> 02:50:46.765]  He's trying to unify things.
[02:50:46.785 --> 02:50:49.287]  He's talking about Ted Cruz for some jobs too, but you notice that didn't happen.
[02:50:49.707 --> 02:50:52.348]  Cruz has been asking for a Supreme Court job for over a year from Trump.
[02:50:52.868 --> 02:50:57.994]  So, uh, you want me to come back to you, Nick, and tell us your take on this, on the other side.
[02:50:58.034 --> 02:50:59.916]  Then Matt, Chris, Justin, and others.
[02:51:00.517 --> 02:51:03.620]  I'm Alex Jones, Infowars.com, one of the biggest websites in the world.
[02:51:04.301 --> 02:51:05.963]  The enemy hates the site, keeps spreading it.
[02:51:06.043 --> 02:51:07.845]  You are winning, folks.
[02:51:07.925 --> 02:51:08.386]  You are winning.
[02:51:20.051 --> 02:51:27.694]  What is a president-elect and future president, Trump, going to be doing to fight a press that's already positioning themselves to be non-friendly?
[02:51:28.395 --> 02:51:30.956]  Well, Leanne, I think your analysis is exactly right.
[02:51:31.136 --> 02:51:35.658]  I was a member of President Ronald Reagan's transition, not once, but twice.
[02:51:35.678 --> 02:51:37.859]  So I have seen this movie.
[02:51:38.699 --> 02:51:55.184]  Uh, and, uh, there are an enormous number of federal positions that must be filled, but I think they are wise to take their time to sort out the best qualified people, but most importantly, those who are not globalists, those who are not neocons.
[02:51:55.204 --> 02:51:59.205]  I mean, we didn't defeat Jeb Bush so that we could empower his lackeys.
[02:51:59.785 --> 02:52:02.407]  That wasn't the point of this election.
[02:52:02.867 --> 02:52:07.490]  And now you have two things going on in Washington, I think, that are very important.
[02:52:07.730 --> 02:52:12.413]  One is the unprecedented personal attack on Steve Bannon.
[02:52:13.274 --> 02:52:19.718]  Now, in full disclosure, I write for Breitbart, and I intend to continue writing for them.
[02:52:20.599 --> 02:52:22.800]  I think Steve Bannon is a freedom fighter.
[02:52:23.421 --> 02:52:26.223]  I think that he can think outside the box.
[02:52:26.803 --> 02:52:29.065]  He understands the new media.
[02:52:29.745 --> 02:52:33.449]  He particularly understands who Donald Trump's enemies are.
[02:52:33.909 --> 02:52:35.690]  He understands the globalist threat.
[02:52:36.091 --> 02:52:42.896]  He understands the threat of the neocons and those who would immerse us in war without reason.
[02:52:43.557 --> 02:52:52.664]  And he is particularly focused on the immigration issue and the fact that our current immigration policies have left our neighborhoods and our homes unsafe.
[02:52:53.485 --> 02:53:00.833]  Bannon, who I have known for some time, is not an anti-Semite, has never been an anti-Semite.
[02:53:01.514 --> 02:53:02.635]  This is a canard.
[02:53:03.416 --> 02:53:04.778]  This is a fraud.
[02:53:05.799 --> 02:53:08.822]  Why are they so desperate to unhorse Steve Bannon?
[02:53:09.543 --> 02:53:10.764]  Because he gets it.
[02:53:11.104 --> 02:53:13.685]  Because he knows who the bad guys are.
[02:53:13.785 --> 02:53:21.049]  And because the war he has waged at Breitbart is focused exactly at the mainstream media.
[02:53:21.489 --> 02:53:24.511]  Now, I'm glad to see we're starting to get some balance.
[02:53:24.591 --> 02:53:31.295]  I saw the National Jewish Coalition come forward and denounce these attacks as fraudulent.
[02:53:32.235 --> 02:53:35.257]  But it has to be tough to be Steve Bannon, to go home every night
[02:53:35.777 --> 02:53:38.760]  After they have dumped this load of garbage on you.
[02:53:39.260 --> 02:53:42.123]  Steve Bannon is not a hater, has never been a hater.
[02:53:42.624 --> 02:53:48.329]  He is the guarder of the Trump flame, or I should say the guardian of the Trump flame.
[02:53:48.729 --> 02:53:50.992]  And that's why they want to get rid of him.
[02:53:51.352 --> 02:53:59.620]  Because he's got their number, and he understands that the globalists, the Soros-funded globalists, they're not going to quit.
[02:54:13.370 --> 02:54:14.250]  You know what's crazy?
[02:54:22.814 --> 02:54:26.295]  It's not just that they're saying all the Trump supporters are racist with almost no evidence.
[02:54:27.255 --> 02:54:32.057]  It's that they've got all these hyped up people beating up white folks.
[02:54:32.697 --> 02:54:34.938]  And then CNN even goes, well they're white, they deserve it.
[02:54:35.859 --> 02:54:36.679]  We played those clips.
[02:54:38.649 --> 02:54:42.511]  And then meanwhile, all Trump's trying to deliver is tax cuts and things like that.
[02:54:43.051 --> 02:54:45.372]  People are really, really seeing through this right now.
[02:54:47.013 --> 02:54:48.734]  And so I just tell the system, keep it up.
[02:54:48.854 --> 02:54:50.735]  I mean, you are just so delusional.
[02:54:50.755 --> 02:54:58.378]  There's something about wimps that strolled in and took over this free country, that they've taken our restraint as weakness.
[02:54:58.398 --> 02:55:02.841]  They've taken our kindness as weakness, and they're about to find out that, well, they are finding out that's not the case.
[02:55:02.881 --> 02:55:05.542]  I mean, they death threat me and stuff, and I'm like,
[02:55:07.034 --> 02:55:08.595]  I'm a freaking maniac!
[02:55:08.655 --> 02:55:09.955]  You really think I'm scared?
[02:55:09.975 --> 02:55:11.976]  I'm not just saying that.
[02:55:12.016 --> 02:55:13.256]  I mean, I really am a maniac.
[02:55:13.276 --> 02:55:14.856]  I mean, I'm kind of ashamed of it at some point.
[02:55:15.637 --> 02:55:18.157]  I mean, you think I'm playing games here with you people?
[02:55:20.258 --> 02:55:24.039]  I've sworn on the altar of God my entire soul against you.
[02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:28.020]  I have turned myself completely over to the resistance of you.
[02:55:28.040 --> 02:55:29.001]  Do you understand what that means?
[02:55:30.941 --> 02:55:31.922]  You're trying to threaten me?
[02:55:31.942 --> 02:55:33.762]  That's a joke!
[02:55:35.463 --> 02:55:36.003]  You're a joke!
[02:55:39.380 --> 02:55:43.323]  The truth is, I'll lose my soul and be destroyed if I don't resist you.
[02:55:43.363 --> 02:55:43.843]  I know that.
[02:55:44.984 --> 02:55:52.490]  My frantic resistance to you is my panicked psyche realizing how evil you are that I've got to resist you or I'm with you.
[02:55:53.911 --> 02:55:57.193]  I'm guilty constantly that I'm not doing enough to fight you, you sacks of filth.
[02:55:59.195 --> 02:56:01.537]  It's not because I'm some good person, but it's because I love God.
[02:56:03.510 --> 02:56:07.071]  If there's a bright point in the universe, you're the furthest point from it, and I just think you need to know that.
[02:56:07.311 --> 02:56:11.672]  Not in a demoralizing way, I just want you to know you mean nothing to me, those of you that serve this system.
[02:56:11.972 --> 02:56:13.852]  And I don't talk to our listeners a lot, I talk to the enemy.
[02:56:14.352 --> 02:56:17.493]  Because I want the enemy to know that I see you and I know who you are.
[02:56:19.273 --> 02:56:20.534]  And you know I see you, and that's good.
[02:56:20.554 --> 02:56:23.874]  I'll let Nick finish on the Kissinger thing.
[02:56:24.435 --> 02:56:25.675]  Yes, I was doing the goblin joke.
[02:56:25.775 --> 02:56:27.015]  He met with Kissinger yesterday.
[02:56:27.915 --> 02:56:30.436]  He says he'll meet with the Shah of Iran.
[02:56:32.406 --> 02:56:44.135]  So all I care about is leaving the guns alone, defending the borders, cutting taxes, prosecuting the Clintons, not putting a foot on America's neck.
[02:56:44.956 --> 02:56:58.207]  That's what we're pushing, that's what we're promoting, and just not caring about political correctness now and all these moral high ground people that want us to go, we're sorry we've been bad, you're right, I'm sorry, I'm racist, and I'm not.
[02:56:59.403 --> 02:57:02.251]  In fact, I transcend all you people pushing the racism line.
[02:57:02.592 --> 02:57:03.073]  Nick, go ahead.
[02:57:05.498 --> 02:57:16.160]  You know, I'm thinking this is probably just their last ditch effort to try, you know, and I know he's not going to sell out, but try to get Trump on board before they go to plan B, which is, unfortunately, they're going to try to take him out.
[02:57:16.200 --> 02:57:18.361]  And that terrifies me that that's a possibility.
[02:57:18.381 --> 02:57:18.761]  That's right.
[02:57:18.821 --> 02:57:27.162]  And Trump, by the way, Trump, by the way, is is really into the spirit of it and is very fatalistic is the word that's been used, but that's improper.
[02:57:27.202 --> 02:57:29.263]  He just is committed and he has no fear.
[02:57:29.303 --> 02:57:29.703]  He loves it.
[02:57:31.317 --> 02:57:31.577]  Right.
[02:57:32.478 --> 02:57:34.460]  That's why he won't move out of Trump Tower.
[02:57:34.841 --> 02:57:35.742]  I kind of wish he would.
[02:57:36.923 --> 02:57:40.486]  Well, brother, look, Trump's in another level now.
[02:57:40.687 --> 02:57:42.889]  And so he's stepped up there.
[02:57:42.949 --> 02:57:44.010]  That's what it's all about, brother.
[02:57:44.190 --> 02:57:47.533]  And all of us that fight this tyranny are right there with him.
[02:57:49.824 --> 02:57:50.545]  This is biblical.
[02:57:50.725 --> 02:57:51.366]  This is biblical.
[02:57:51.746 --> 02:57:52.667]  I appreciate your call.
[02:57:52.707 --> 02:57:53.668]  Great points there.
[02:57:54.208 --> 02:57:55.810]  Yeah, no, the Kissinger thing's gotta happen.
[02:57:56.390 --> 02:57:58.593]  That guy represents the Rothschilds and Rockefellers.
[02:57:59.013 --> 02:58:00.354]  Justin and Florida, you're on the air.
[02:58:00.394 --> 02:58:01.716]  We're gonna hold music the last 10 seconds.
[02:58:01.736 --> 02:58:01.956]  Go ahead.
[02:58:06.072 --> 02:58:07.434]  How's stuff in Florida there, Justin?
[02:58:07.594 --> 02:58:08.215]  Everything good there?
[02:58:08.235 --> 02:58:08.775]  Everything nice?
[02:58:08.795 --> 02:58:09.977]  A little bit of birdies flapping around?
[02:58:09.997 --> 02:58:11.899]  A little bit of nice stuff going on?
[02:58:11.959 --> 02:58:13.641]  Yeah, actually, the weather's getting cool.
[02:58:13.681 --> 02:58:14.522]  It's nice.
[02:58:15.063 --> 02:58:17.025]  So, I just want to get right to the point, though.
[02:58:17.065 --> 02:58:20.309]  I believe that now we're at a point where everybody knows the revolution has begun.
[02:58:20.990 --> 02:58:22.071]  We're ready to take action.
[02:58:22.791 --> 02:58:25.813]  And it's time for a plan on how to do that.
[02:58:25.833 --> 02:58:27.714]  And I have a plan to do that.
[02:58:28.515 --> 02:58:34.298]  And so we need to rally behind our new president and continue this revolution.
[02:58:42.918 --> 02:58:44.580]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:44.600 --> 02:58:45.460]  Stay with us.
[02:58:45.500 --> 02:58:46.361]  Hour number four.
[02:58:46.401 --> 02:58:47.802]  That was a Stanley Kubrick joke.
[02:58:47.822 --> 02:58:48.703]  We're not being Nazis.
[02:58:48.723 --> 02:58:49.444]  We're making fun of Nazis.
[02:58:50.144 --> 02:58:51.345]  The New York Times, okay?
[02:58:51.365 --> 02:58:53.147]  We don't use code words like you do.
[02:58:53.167 --> 02:58:53.788]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:53.848 --> 02:58:56.370]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:59:09.821 --> 02:59:17.727]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:17.807 --> 02:59:20.890]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[02:59:21.701 --> 02:59:23.562]  And they're also very affordable.
[02:59:45.689 --> 02:59:52.436]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[02:59:52.837 --> 02:59:53.598]  It's a win-win.
[02:59:54.078 --> 02:59:55.139]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:00:02.227 --> 03:00:04.850]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:11.926 --> 03:00:14.688]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[03:00:14.708 --> 03:00:24.115]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:24.195 --> 03:00:27.597]  Republic Defense Fleet has won decisive battles against the Globalists.
[03:00:28.338 --> 03:00:31.340]  We've captured the Capitol.
[03:00:32.561 --> 03:00:34.022]  But only have a tenuous beachhead.
[03:00:35.683 --> 03:00:36.544]  Would you like to know more?
[03:00:37.483 --> 03:00:40.104]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's, uh, that kind of ended quickly.
[03:00:40.124 --> 03:00:41.585]  I want to hear some more of Starship Troopers.
[03:00:42.205 --> 03:00:45.667]  Justin in Florida, so, what do we do?
[03:00:47.328 --> 03:00:50.729]  Okay, so, basically, you already have the platform to get us started.
[03:00:51.190 --> 03:00:57.353]  So, we need to go out to multiple cities, multiple states, and form teams in all those states that go out.
[03:00:57.713 --> 03:01:06.137]  We can hit gun shows, we can hit, uh, Act for America, programs like that, that we know are vetted and that actually are on our team and on our side.
[03:01:06.597 --> 03:01:11.540]  And get out, hand out flyers, have cameras there, interview people, get their questions, get their concerns.
[03:01:11.560 --> 03:01:17.664]  Sure, we should continue energizing the base for a liberty movement, but I say get outside the box, and don't just go where awake Americans are.
[03:01:18.064 --> 03:01:33.813]  I think we should adopt liberals, I think we should adopt immigrants who are here legally, and like, I'm serious, the way to beat this is give people jobs, be their friend, not just because we're being patronizing, but the globalists are going to turn them into racist nut jobs, so we're going to have to reach out to people.
[03:01:34.949 --> 03:01:36.070]  Yeah, that's it.
[03:01:36.090 --> 03:01:36.711]  That's what it is.
[03:01:36.731 --> 03:01:41.016]  Just get out there, whatever it takes, to get out on the streets and have people hit the ground running.
[03:01:41.036 --> 03:01:41.377]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:01:41.397 --> 03:01:46.243]  Look, notice they've totally ignored Martin Luther King's plan, and they've gone now to re-segregation.
[03:01:46.583 --> 03:01:47.665]  They want everybody in little groups.
[03:01:47.725 --> 03:01:52.190]  The answer is, reach out, everybody come together, get out of comfort zones and really do it.
[03:01:52.570 --> 03:01:53.732]  Now, it doesn't mean it's easy, man.
[03:01:55.151 --> 03:01:56.112]  You know, brainwashed idiots.
[03:01:56.132 --> 03:01:57.214]  I don't want to call them racist.
[03:01:57.254 --> 03:01:59.096]  They just think I'm out to get them because I'm a white guy.
[03:01:59.116 --> 03:02:01.199]  Blow up to me since the media did this.
[03:02:01.219 --> 03:02:02.361]  But that's the media's fault.
[03:02:02.381 --> 03:02:05.004]  That's why we've got to make sure the mainstream media basically implodes.
[03:02:05.465 --> 03:02:07.227]  By the way, I like Tom Hanks as an actor.
[03:02:08.080 --> 03:02:12.702]  But after he did all these ads saying Trump's racist, I'm not watching another Tom Hanks movie, and I mean it.
[03:02:13.142 --> 03:02:14.363]  I'm not going to see Inferno.
[03:02:16.084 --> 03:02:16.464]  I'm done.
[03:02:16.984 --> 03:02:19.325]  Even though Clint Eastwood put him in that last movie, it was good.
[03:02:20.226 --> 03:02:21.987]  Sully, I'm just done with Tom Hanks.
[03:02:22.007 --> 03:02:23.747]  Hey, ovar, Tom Hanks.
[03:02:23.767 --> 03:02:24.868]  You're an enemy of this country.
[03:02:25.188 --> 03:02:26.088]  You're a piece of crap.
[03:02:26.189 --> 03:02:26.729]  I'm done with you.
[03:02:27.229 --> 03:02:29.050]  That goes for Michael Moore, any of these guys.
[03:02:29.170 --> 03:02:29.610]  I'm done.
[03:02:30.370 --> 03:02:31.151]  Great point, Justin.
[03:02:31.551 --> 03:02:33.172]  Alright, Kristen Virginia, you're on the air.
[03:02:36.206 --> 03:02:36.807]  I think so.
[03:02:54.140 --> 03:02:55.242]  I'll be honest with you about Ron Paul.
[03:02:55.282 --> 03:02:57.224]  I'll be honest with you about Ron Paul.
[03:03:06.641 --> 03:03:21.393]  He's a purist and wants to change ideology, but the problem is you've got to mix ideology with the politics, because whatever the energy of the time is, you've got to at least touchstone that, not in a manipulative way, but cover that issue, hijack an issue to get folks in to hear the truth.
[03:03:21.894 --> 03:03:23.275]  So Paul is too pure.
[03:03:23.815 --> 03:03:32.182]  Ventura, I think, is a little bit butthurt over the fact that he's not in the limelight or whatever, and so just wants to basically, you know, act like he doesn't care.
[03:03:32.582 --> 03:03:34.604]  Real revolutions happening with Trump right now.
[03:03:34.644 --> 03:03:35.465]  This is the real deal.
[03:03:37.970 --> 03:03:47.958]  And then the last thing I said, I was watching Michelle Obama on the campaign trail, and she was doing that speech about Trump.
[03:03:48.399 --> 03:03:52.082]  I seen fear in her eyes, and it dawned on me.
[03:03:52.322 --> 03:03:55.044]  It was like fear from their legacy.
[03:03:55.084 --> 03:04:05.032]  It looked like they built up eight years of this class, this, that, and the other, and then one instant, Trump doing just half of what he said he was going to do for the American people.
[03:04:05.293 --> 03:04:06.434]  Their whole legacy would be gone.
[03:04:06.474 --> 03:04:06.654]  Poof!
[03:04:08.312 --> 03:04:08.652]  That's right.
[03:04:08.712 --> 03:04:09.573]  Oh, imagine.
[03:04:09.773 --> 03:04:11.594]  Oh, we're just going to cut your taxes to zero.
[03:04:11.654 --> 03:04:13.716]  Forget giving you money and telling you how to live your life.
[03:04:13.796 --> 03:04:14.376]  Here's your money.
[03:04:15.137 --> 03:04:19.180]  Imagine, and then there'll be a boom, and that exactly discredits their whole thing, doesn't it?
[03:04:20.566 --> 03:04:33.652]  Yeah, it sure does, and I just thought to find that real funny, and then I asked my white friends in the small town, what do you think about another white person coming up to you calling you a freaking white male?
[03:04:34.913 --> 03:04:43.597]  And the look on their faces like, because we live in a small town, it doesn't happen around here that much, but it's like they don't even believe that that's going on.
[03:04:43.637 --> 03:04:44.658]  I've had it happen to me!
[03:04:44.818 --> 03:04:49.040]  They're like these weirdo, they're beyond racist, it's like they're just crazy people.
[03:04:49.620 --> 03:04:52.783]  And you're just sitting there and they go, you're a frickin' white male, you don't have anything to say.
[03:04:52.803 --> 03:04:54.625]  And you're like, I didn't think of myself as a white male.
[03:04:54.645 --> 03:04:56.046]  I don't walk around like, I'm a white male.
[03:04:56.166 --> 03:04:57.107]  I'm a white male.
[03:04:57.447 --> 03:05:00.370]  I walk around like thinking, I want to go eat some enchiladas.
[03:05:01.251 --> 03:05:01.891]  I want to come back.
[03:05:01.931 --> 03:05:02.412]  Thank you, Chris.
[03:05:02.432 --> 03:05:02.892]  Great points.
[03:05:03.213 --> 03:05:05.435]  Matt and Diana, then we'll hand the baton to David Knight.
[03:05:05.735 --> 03:05:06.235]  Stay with us.
[03:05:19.363 --> 03:05:20.624]  Then what happens if Hillary gets in?
[03:05:20.664 --> 03:05:23.027]  My God, I mean, she's universally loathed.
[03:05:24.488 --> 03:05:31.415]  Well, as I said, if she gets in, it's going to be the beginning of a new populist movement like this country's never seen in modern history.
[03:05:32.196 --> 03:05:36.420]  And what you said before, Hillary Clinton, the mainstream media, have destroyed themselves.
[03:05:37.141 --> 03:05:41.745]  I want to do a little trends research here just to show you how fixed and rigged the game is.
[03:05:42.546 --> 03:05:43.947]  These are some New York Times.
[03:05:44.007 --> 03:05:46.169]  I'm going to rush through a couple of them very quickly.
[03:05:46.189 --> 03:05:50.713]  A failing inside mission to tame Trump's tongue.
[03:05:51.173 --> 03:05:51.974]  August 14th.
[03:05:52.414 --> 03:05:54.236]  New York Times front page.
[03:05:54.676 --> 03:05:56.398]  Nothing negative about Clinton.
[03:05:56.598 --> 03:06:00.361]  Secret ledger in Ukraine lists cash for top Trump aide.
[03:06:00.862 --> 03:06:01.182]  August 15th.
[03:06:02.703 --> 03:06:07.807]  New York Times, front page, which is why they call themselves the paper of record.
[03:06:08.347 --> 03:06:12.890]  I call them the toilet paper of record, because that's all this is good for.
[03:06:12.990 --> 03:06:14.391]  Monday, November 7th, 2016.
[03:06:18.214 --> 03:06:20.375]  Beautiful picture there of Hillary Clinton.
[03:06:20.995 --> 03:06:22.956]  Very wonderfully framed.
[03:06:23.756 --> 03:06:25.317]  A nice pump piece for her.
[03:06:25.797 --> 03:06:27.278]  FBI says review.
[03:06:27.418 --> 03:06:30.099]  Clears Clinton in email inquiry.
[03:06:31.260 --> 03:06:34.521]  Below it, the storm below the calm.
[03:06:34.741 --> 03:06:38.603]  An inside view of Trump's last stand.
[03:06:39.283 --> 03:06:40.784]  Then we're going to go to today's.
[03:06:42.768 --> 03:06:47.495]  Look at the difference of the lightness, the crowd around Hillary Clinton.
[03:06:47.895 --> 03:06:50.359]  Look how dark they frame Donald Trump.
[03:06:50.839 --> 03:06:54.084]  It looks like nothing around him but a couple of hands sticking up.
[03:06:54.645 --> 03:06:56.707]  What I'm saying to you, Alex... They're inverting reality.
[03:06:57.890 --> 03:07:03.892]  Yes, and so when you said they've destroyed themselves, they've lost their credibility.
[03:07:03.912 --> 03:07:06.112]  Other little jewels you'd like to impart to the audience.
[03:07:06.953 --> 03:07:11.374]  Yes, what's going on in the equity markets, whatever happens, it's only temporary.
[03:07:11.994 --> 03:07:17.896]  It's a global economy, it's bigger than a nation of 5% of the world's population.
[03:07:18.396 --> 03:07:22.777]  There's a global recession going on, as I said, just in the United States.
[03:07:23.097 --> 03:07:24.678]  They brought the economy down to put Obama in.
[03:07:24.778 --> 03:07:26.840]  Now they're trying to prop it up to put Hillary in.
[03:07:27.100 --> 03:07:29.903]  But boy, no matter what, if Trump gets in or she gets in, do you agree?
[03:07:30.183 --> 03:07:31.264]  They're getting ready to drop the market.
[03:07:32.165 --> 03:07:32.525]  It is.
[03:07:32.845 --> 03:07:36.909]  And again, just look at the last nine months in the United States.
[03:07:37.529 --> 03:07:39.971]  Our import-export trade is down.
[03:07:40.071 --> 03:07:44.055]  Just in the U.S., 500 billion dollars.
[03:07:44.555 --> 03:07:45.956]  There is no recovery.
[03:07:46.357 --> 03:07:47.298]  If Hillary gets in,
[03:07:47.898 --> 03:08:02.728]  Wall Street will cheer, because again, read the WikiLeaks, how she's a member of the Goldman Sachs gang, and why do you think they paid her and Bill $250,000, $300,000 an hour to speak, when you could hear a BS before you.
[03:08:03.528 --> 03:08:04.769]  A total payoff!
[03:08:05.830 --> 03:08:06.350]  You got it.
[03:08:27.081 --> 03:08:31.718]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:38.174 --> 03:08:39.054]  I'm about to punch out, though.
[03:08:39.074 --> 03:08:39.835]  He's about to take over.
[03:08:40.335 --> 03:08:41.316]  I'm dealing with Sandy Hook.
[03:08:41.336 --> 03:08:45.538]  They try to misrepresent what I say, because I simply say I question the official story.
[03:08:46.558 --> 03:08:48.619]  So, they made a big issue out of that.
[03:08:48.639 --> 03:08:49.960]  We got more phone calls coming up.
[03:08:50.500 --> 03:08:51.881]  But briefly, I just wanted to say this.
[03:08:52.061 --> 03:08:56.343]  You know, I said it was 70 million phones and devices that the Communist Chinese loaded.
[03:08:57.063 --> 03:09:00.105]  Backdoor devices to steal your passcodes and rob your bank accounts.
[03:09:00.705 --> 03:09:01.126]  You name it.
[03:09:01.426 --> 03:09:02.446]  No, no, I'm sorry.
[03:09:02.506 --> 03:09:03.467]  It's 700 million devices.
[03:09:04.167 --> 03:09:05.287]  And this is just an illustration.
[03:09:05.388 --> 03:09:05.968]  Imagine.
[03:09:06.108 --> 03:09:07.428]  I'm not some Russophile.
[03:09:07.448 --> 03:09:08.249]  I've never been to Russia.
[03:09:08.709 --> 03:09:09.969]  Just Russia's doing nothing.
[03:09:10.069 --> 03:09:10.489]  Imagine.
[03:09:10.509 --> 03:09:12.030]  They were saying Russia's hacking us.
[03:09:12.450 --> 03:09:20.853]  The Communist Chinese had 700 million devices, we now learn, that they put backdoor technology on to control everything.
[03:09:20.893 --> 03:09:22.174]  They're merged with the globalists.
[03:09:22.594 --> 03:09:23.434]  This is just crazy.
[03:09:23.454 --> 03:09:24.995]  But before we go there, I just want to say one thing.
[03:09:26.296 --> 03:09:29.837]  We're all excited right now about the Liberty Movement and Trump and what's happening.
[03:09:31.058 --> 03:09:34.160]  But listen, this wouldn't be happening if it wasn't for God's hand moving.
[03:09:34.200 --> 03:09:35.381]  So it is God doing this.
[03:09:36.241 --> 03:09:41.644]  The MVP in all this, we can say, is Julian Assange or Matt Drudge or whoever, but it really is God.
[03:09:42.245 --> 03:09:43.766]  At the end of the day, so I just want to say that.
[03:09:43.866 --> 03:09:44.806]  I'm so thankful to God.
[03:09:44.826 --> 03:09:46.367]  It's such an amazing time to be alive.
[03:09:47.028 --> 03:09:47.448]  David Knight?
[03:09:47.788 --> 03:09:48.148]  Absolutely.
[03:09:48.168 --> 03:09:51.050]  You know, Alex, the report that I did yesterday about the two cities.
[03:09:51.070 --> 03:09:56.373]  You know, we've got New York City with a float of petitions saying, get Trump's name off of our apartment building.
[03:09:56.413 --> 03:09:58.955]  Meanwhile, you've got another petition being floated in a Russian town.
[03:09:59.615 --> 03:10:06.579]  And they want the name of a road that was put in by the communists who are proud of their godless atheism.
[03:10:06.619 --> 03:10:10.941]  They named not one, but two roads godless in this small Russian town.
[03:10:11.262 --> 03:10:15.444]  And these people are circulating a petition saying they want one of these roads renamed Donald Trump.
[03:10:15.504 --> 03:10:16.544]  That tells you two things.
[03:10:16.624 --> 03:10:17.445]  It tells you, number one,
[03:10:17.885 --> 03:10:20.266]  These people feel they have really dodged the bullet.
[03:10:20.286 --> 03:10:24.408]  We've had nothing but Obama and Hillary Clinton saying, let's declare a no-fly zone.
[03:10:24.468 --> 03:10:25.789]  Let's go to war with the Russians.
[03:10:26.589 --> 03:10:28.870]  This is like the beginning of the Cold War.
[03:10:28.890 --> 03:10:30.671]  We had Nikita Khrushchev coming to the UN.
[03:10:30.711 --> 03:10:31.451]  Beating his shoe.
[03:10:31.491 --> 03:10:33.412]  Yeah, shoe on the podium saying, we will bury you.
[03:10:33.632 --> 03:10:35.013]  I mean, that's what these people were looking at.
[03:10:35.033 --> 03:10:35.933]  It was a real threat.
[03:10:36.574 --> 03:10:37.834]  And they just dodged that bullet.
[03:10:37.954 --> 03:10:38.615]  On the other hand,
[03:10:39.329 --> 03:10:55.163]  The people in Russia, as you just pointed out, about this victory belonging to God, we have to understand that there's a lot of people in Russia that are moving towards God, as you've got people in New York and other bastions of the Democrat Party proudly becoming godless atheists, moving the other direction.
[03:10:55.203 --> 03:10:58.486]  And so these people are saying, hey, we don't want to be known anymore.
[03:10:58.506 --> 03:11:00.227]  And you know why they're so scared?
[03:11:00.267 --> 03:11:02.229]  They can feel God coming back into the world.
[03:11:02.389 --> 03:11:02.549]  Yeah.
[03:11:02.929 --> 03:11:04.090]  As we open the door, it's happening.
[03:11:04.550 --> 03:11:06.592]  I mean, it's not mumbo-jumbo.
[03:11:06.852 --> 03:11:07.772]  We didn't pre-script this.
[03:11:08.033 --> 03:11:08.713]  There's no teleprompters.
[03:11:08.933 --> 03:11:10.014]  Do you not feel the energy?
[03:11:10.414 --> 03:11:15.457]  Like, I can feel the battle going back and forth, but lately, it just seems like liberty is just exploding.
[03:11:15.597 --> 03:11:16.238]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:11:16.418 --> 03:11:17.399]  It absolutely is amazing.
[03:11:17.679 --> 03:11:21.801]  And it's amazing to see that happening, and we see people, you know, choosing up sides.
[03:11:21.841 --> 03:11:22.922]  You know, choose who you're going to serve.
[03:11:22.942 --> 03:11:28.045]  You're going to serve the godless atheists with their communism, with their socialism?
[03:11:28.065 --> 03:11:29.106]  We will never be there for you.
[03:11:29.226 --> 03:11:29.426]  Yeah.
[03:11:29.747 --> 03:11:34.732]  Or are you going to serve the people who have compassion for others, who've tried to help people?
[03:11:35.292 --> 03:11:40.598]  And that's what we're seeing, not only in America, but we see an awakening, Alex, you're talking about, across the entire world.
[03:11:40.718 --> 03:11:42.780]  And that's why there's been a demonization of America.
[03:11:43.080 --> 03:11:46.163]  Because for all of our evils, it truly had a Christian core to it.
[03:11:46.343 --> 03:11:46.624]  That's right.
[03:11:46.664 --> 03:11:47.605]  That's what the enemy hates.
[03:11:47.745 --> 03:11:47.925]  Yeah.
[03:11:48.185 --> 03:11:49.447]  God, there's never been a perfect country.
[03:11:49.887 --> 03:11:51.289]  And we don't ever have any perfect people.
[03:11:51.570 --> 03:11:57.198]  And you can go in and you can pick at somebody's life and you can find a lot of bad things about anybody.
[03:11:57.278 --> 03:12:03.627]  Just like earlier this week where the people were apoplectic at the University of Virginia because somebody there had referenced Thomas Jefferson.
[03:12:05.289 --> 03:12:15.036]  You know, so yeah, you can find bad things in Jefferson's life and you can ignore the massive number of... He tried to end slavery in the first Bill of Rights and they wouldn't let him and they said he had slaves.
[03:12:15.396 --> 03:12:18.958]  That was people that were on his family that he had children with.
[03:12:19.239 --> 03:12:20.379]  He was trying to end it.
[03:12:20.539 --> 03:12:21.140]  He couldn't.
[03:12:21.380 --> 03:12:22.581]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:12:22.621 --> 03:12:24.102]  That's how they distort everything.
[03:12:24.182 --> 03:12:24.322]  Yeah.
[03:12:24.522 --> 03:12:25.623]  He tried to end it.
[03:12:25.863 --> 03:12:26.964]  He was born into it.
[03:12:27.284 --> 03:12:28.846]  He's a hero, not a bad guy.
[03:12:28.926 --> 03:12:29.246]  That's right.
[03:12:29.506 --> 03:12:32.589]  You have to look at it in the context of what he was and what he tried to do.
[03:12:32.949 --> 03:12:38.173]  And he had a long section of... You try being in Virginia and say 1,800 drowned in slavery.
[03:12:38.313 --> 03:12:38.654]  That's right.
[03:12:38.814 --> 03:12:39.154]  That's right.
[03:12:39.274 --> 03:12:40.195]  That's not too popular.
[03:12:40.315 --> 03:12:41.816]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:12:42.357 --> 03:12:45.840]  Yeah, he kind of stuck out there and actually he was... But then they invert it.
[03:12:46.120 --> 03:12:50.824]  The founder of the Democratic Party, you said there later were racists, they invert it and make him a racist.
[03:12:51.004 --> 03:12:51.604]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:12:52.125 --> 03:13:01.191]  He had long sections in the Declaration of Independence talking about slavery, and then he and other Virginia plantation owners, and again, it was a time they lived in.
[03:13:01.251 --> 03:13:05.895]  There was some paternalism, but they wanted to free their slaves, but they said, how do we do this?
[03:13:05.995 --> 03:13:09.477]  Because if we let them free here, they're going to be picked on by other people.
[03:13:09.517 --> 03:13:14.080]  They came up with Liberia, and they repatriated some of them back there.
[03:13:14.100 --> 03:13:18.864]  So I mean, they did what they could, but he was focused on... Lincoln looked at Schiff and everybody back.
[03:13:19.364 --> 03:13:19.644]  What's that?
[03:13:19.745 --> 03:13:20.685]  Yeah, exactly, yeah.
[03:13:20.705 --> 03:13:22.207]  You just throw people out on the side of the beach?
[03:13:22.487 --> 03:13:26.591]  As a matter of fact, you know, you go back and you look at what Lincoln said in the debates with Douglass.
[03:13:26.611 --> 03:13:30.594]  He said, I would not free one black slave... Yeah, exactly.
[03:13:30.634 --> 03:13:35.378]  So, you know, there were some really racist... Truth is, what they teach is not what went on.
[03:13:35.498 --> 03:13:36.159]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:13:36.179 --> 03:13:37.060]  You have to go back to the original.
[03:13:37.080 --> 03:13:41.423]  The point is, is that it's the West, not so much the U.S., but England that ended slavery.
[03:13:42.324 --> 03:13:43.986]  And they did it without a war.
[03:13:44.606 --> 03:13:49.389]  They did it with the, first he had one guy, Wilberforce, who spent his entire life making that his cause.
[03:13:49.429 --> 03:13:50.309]  And never lived to see it.
[03:13:50.509 --> 03:13:57.753]  Yeah, he stopped the slave trade and then just before he died, they stopped the ownership of slaves and they compensated people for their slaves and did it without a war.
[03:13:57.813 --> 03:14:00.815]  And we're living, though, to see globalism.
[03:14:00.855 --> 03:14:08.499]  I mean, who would have thought a year ago there'd be a headline on DrudgeReport.com that they're desperately, let me put it on screen, desperately trying to save it.
[03:14:08.939 --> 03:14:10.700]  They're just plotting their survival now.
[03:14:11.400 --> 03:14:12.181]  Mm-hmm.
[03:14:12.241 --> 03:14:29.476]  And what Wilberforce did, and I talked about how Nigel Farage reminded me of Wilberforce because he hammered this singular issue, and it's something that he's done for decades, and how Wilberforce eventually prevailed, and I know that even though they're pushing back on it in the UK on Brexit, they say they don't have a plan so forth.
[03:14:29.536 --> 03:14:31.117]  It doesn't matter, it's the beginning of the end.
[03:14:31.357 --> 03:14:31.798]  Exactly.
[03:14:32.198 --> 03:14:37.122]  But again, going back to where you started with God, okay, why did William Wilberforce do that?
[03:14:37.503 --> 03:14:39.004]  It was because of his Christian conversion.
[03:14:39.524 --> 03:14:45.667]  And he was going to become a pastor, and you had Newton, who wrote Amazing Grace, said, no, you're where God wants you to be.
[03:14:46.068 --> 03:14:46.808]  Change that.
[03:14:47.328 --> 03:14:48.789]  Get rid of slavery.
[03:14:48.869 --> 03:14:49.509]  Do something there.
[03:14:49.549 --> 03:14:50.150]  So that's what he did.
[03:14:50.190 --> 03:14:51.771]  We're all called to do different things.
[03:14:52.131 --> 03:14:52.791]  That's what he did.
[03:14:53.031 --> 03:14:57.754]  He made it his lifelong calling, and it was inspired by his Christian principles.
[03:14:57.814 --> 03:15:05.158]  And that's what even people like Stephen Molyneux, who's not a Christian, he said, look... Let me ask you this question, and then I'm going to get out of here, because I know you've got to cover stuff and take calls, and there's a big special coming up.
[03:15:06.098 --> 03:15:17.803]  I'm not demonizing the mainline church, but World Council of Churches, National Council of Churches, Rockefeller's 1900, you know, set it up, the church is all, it's the end of the world, don't fight evil, just go to the church, give us money, big megachurch, save souls.
[03:15:18.104 --> 03:15:24.867]  If you're not fighting evil, your soul's not saved, whether the end of the world's next week or a thousand years from now, we have to oppose this evil now.
[03:15:25.487 --> 03:15:31.650]  And so I'll tell you, I just go off my gut, and also intellectual analysis, I get in megachurches, I feel so empty.
[03:15:32.645 --> 03:15:35.787]  I don't feel panic anywhere, but in mainline churches.
[03:15:35.827 --> 03:15:38.269]  Now, little bitty community churches, little Christian churches, I feel great.
[03:15:38.289 --> 03:15:40.170]  Little Bible studies I go to, I feel great.
[03:15:40.570 --> 03:15:42.232]  In big churches, I feel sick.
[03:15:42.492 --> 03:15:49.496]  Because the office of a preacher, keeping people down, not letting them know their real mission, I think is the most satanic position there is.
[03:15:49.997 --> 03:15:54.780]  And I'm telling you, I've been there, and I've actually dealt with some of them, with mega churches.
[03:15:55.260 --> 03:15:57.282]  They are an instrument of pure evil.
[03:15:57.802 --> 03:16:05.648]  We have to look at the entire structure and get something that is more like the early home churches that they had before Constantine took that over.
[03:16:05.688 --> 03:16:12.974]  Where you have people who are engaged, who are involved, instead of sitting there passively and watching somebody do something at the front.
[03:16:13.034 --> 03:16:15.316]  You know, that's what happened at that point.
[03:16:15.336 --> 03:16:15.917]  That's theater!
[03:16:16.457 --> 03:16:16.877]  Exactly.
[03:16:16.937 --> 03:16:22.521]  It becomes something that you watch, as opposed to something that you participate in, that you're a part of, that you have some responsibility.
[03:16:22.541 --> 03:16:23.201]  And that's the difference, folks.
[03:16:23.241 --> 03:16:24.082]  You're in the info war.
[03:16:24.122 --> 03:16:25.563]  You're taking action out there.
[03:16:26.063 --> 03:16:27.204]  That's why this is not theater.
[03:16:27.284 --> 03:16:27.884]  This is real.
[03:16:28.204 --> 03:16:32.507]  And I think when you look at what's coming up, Alex, Donald Trump is still going to have these big, massive rallies.
[03:16:32.547 --> 03:16:33.168]  He's going to go around.
[03:16:33.208 --> 03:16:38.991]  We need to understand that everybody is truly, as Buckminster Fulley said, hey, we're all crew on the planet Earth.
[03:16:39.291 --> 03:16:41.633]  We're all crew on this movement of liberty.
[03:16:42.033 --> 03:16:44.615]  And if we go back to sleep and say Donald Trump is
[03:16:44.975 --> 03:17:01.599]  President so he can do everything we're gonna lose just like what you're talking about mainline churches you get one guy he may be a great guy he may be a great pastor a great teacher but if he's the only one doing anything nothing is going to happen and if we got a president and you just sit back and don't do anything we're not gonna get anything changed.
[03:17:01.879 --> 03:17:12.722]  Well Trump that's what he said to me you know when I talked to him last week he said just keep it up Alex I need you I appreciate you in your audience I said well thank you sir and he goes no I mean it you tell them thank you I know they're the heart of
[03:17:13.442 --> 03:17:15.804]  Of what's happening and the spirit of this.
[03:17:16.424 --> 03:17:18.026]  Every time I talk to Trump it's about the spirit.
[03:17:18.826 --> 03:17:19.507]  He's pretty heavy.
[03:17:19.547 --> 03:17:24.711]  On TV he's not fake, but that's kind of him being limited Trump in person.
[03:17:24.791 --> 03:17:26.432]  It's like, it's really piercing.
[03:17:28.774 --> 03:17:29.875]  That's what scares them, folks.
[03:17:29.935 --> 03:17:31.396]  They know Trump is not out to get you.
[03:17:31.796 --> 03:17:32.717]  I keep saying that.
[03:17:32.777 --> 03:17:33.938]  Trump, not out to get you.
[03:17:34.739 --> 03:17:36.640]  He loves beating big corporations.
[03:17:36.680 --> 03:17:37.240]  He loves it.
[03:17:37.281 --> 03:17:40.003]  He can't wait to cut poor people's taxes to zero.
[03:17:41.806 --> 03:17:45.569]  And look at what we've seen since he's been elected, in the week and a half or so since he's been elected.
[03:17:45.589 --> 03:17:46.450]  The board's already staying!
[03:17:46.610 --> 03:17:46.810]  Yeah.
[03:17:46.950 --> 03:18:05.265]  We see all these positive changes that have happened, and we see the drumbeat of the mainstream media coming back, well, you're not really going to do what you said you're going to do about the borders, or about the trade deals, or about peace with, you know, going after Russia, and peace, not going after Russia, but going after ISIS, partnering with them, and you're not going to do all that stuff that you said
[03:18:05.265 --> 03:18:12.210]  By the way, notice the Russians went from being threatened with war two weeks ago, they kept bombing ISIS, to now they've got strategic bombers bombing ISIS.
[03:18:12.310 --> 03:18:13.891]  We're not for war, but ISIS is bad.
[03:18:14.091 --> 03:18:18.074]  Our government put them in charge, we now have a moral responsibility to let the Russians take them out.
[03:18:18.435 --> 03:18:22.638]  That's right, and when I look at people who, just before the election, NPR went into North Carolina.
[03:18:23.058 --> 03:18:24.979]  Where I lived, and so it got my attention.
[03:18:24.999 --> 03:18:43.944]  I was flipping through the channels, and I heard the places where I lived, and they talked to these Christians who said, well, normally we vote for Republicans because, you know, we're concerned about abortion, but my husband is a lawyer for foreign companies establishing copyrights here in this country, so we're kind of looking at Hillary Clinton because we don't like what Donald Trump is doing.
[03:18:43.984 --> 03:18:44.684]  Exactly, TPP.
[03:18:45.404 --> 03:18:54.631]  So, exactly, they won the TPP, so they're looking at a way to rationalize it, and they said, well, I think being pro-life means that you help these refugees, and I just was screaming at the radio, who created the refugees?
[03:18:54.911 --> 03:18:57.273]  Well, that was some change agent, that's all, Bob.
[03:18:57.333 --> 03:18:58.133]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:19:02.506 --> 03:19:05.468]  We have a Lost Leader Special at InfoWars995.
[03:19:05.528 --> 03:19:06.509]  Trump is my president shirt.
[03:19:06.549 --> 03:19:07.530]  It's about to sell out.
[03:19:07.610 --> 03:19:09.191]  InfoWars.com.
[03:19:09.211 --> 03:19:10.553]  Legalized freedom on the back.
[03:19:11.053 --> 03:19:12.314]  All new Brain Force.
[03:19:12.334 --> 03:19:13.215]  20% more in each bottle.
[03:19:13.575 --> 03:19:15.176]  And a new, even stronger formulation.
[03:19:15.877 --> 03:19:19.440]  Not just more pills, but actually a stronger formulation.
[03:19:19.460 --> 03:19:20.320]  Brain Force Plus.
[03:19:21.201 --> 03:19:21.781]  He's now here.
[03:19:22.202 --> 03:19:23.042]  I'm really good.
[03:19:23.062 --> 03:19:24.083]  I mean, I'll give myself credit.
[03:19:24.503 --> 03:19:25.764]  It's actually, like, staggering.
[03:19:26.885 --> 03:19:28.546]  It's bizarre.
[03:19:28.786 --> 03:19:29.967]  It's like, is this a simulation?
[03:19:29.987 --> 03:19:32.448]  We're, like, leading the fight against the New World Order and all this?
[03:19:32.508 --> 03:19:35.270]  But we do need the funding, and I'm not good at raising money.
[03:19:35.310 --> 03:19:38.652]  For a media organization this big, we should have ten times the money coming in.
[03:19:38.672 --> 03:19:39.133]  We don't.
[03:19:39.473 --> 03:19:41.214]  So, I'm just asking you, please support us.

[03:19:56.340 --> 03:20:01.563]  I've been talking about all the wars they're trying to start and what's happening in the cyber warfare.
[03:20:02.024 --> 03:20:04.646]  Solutions for Science is having a moving warehouse sale.
[03:20:04.986 --> 03:20:08.789]  Here are three reasons you should get one of their perfect power solar generator systems.
[03:20:08.809 --> 03:20:11.631]  It's the same one I have, top-of-the-line model in my home.
[03:20:11.671 --> 03:20:12.851]  I've actually bought two of them over the years.
[03:20:13.432 --> 03:20:14.453]  Can't believe they can sell them this cheap.
[03:20:14.493 --> 03:20:16.074]  I guess it's monetarization and cost goes down.
[03:20:16.614 --> 03:20:23.536]  It's expandable, has a wind input, and even produces pure sine wave power so you can run medical equipment or even military grade electronics.
[03:20:23.576 --> 03:20:25.616]  Go to powergridchaos.com.
[03:20:25.636 --> 03:20:27.416]  That's powergridchaos.com.
[03:20:27.756 --> 03:20:28.877]  Powergridchaos.com.

[03:20:32.778 --> 03:20:39.499]  And look, I want to pay our crew because it takes stress off them to pay them more so they can take care of their families and what they're doing.
[03:20:40.019 --> 03:20:43.100]  I want to be able to hire more people.
[03:20:44.085 --> 03:20:45.446]  I literally don't want a bigger house.
[03:20:45.687 --> 03:20:47.068]  I don't want a fancier car.
[03:20:49.610 --> 03:20:52.473]  Everything is about a war with these people, and I really want to beat them.
[03:20:52.853 --> 03:20:54.274]  And you can see what Infowars has done.
[03:20:54.314 --> 03:21:02.261]  Now, 126 on the web of all websites, bigger than the New York Times online, bigger than the BBC, and now BBC's all digital.
[03:21:03.803 --> 03:21:05.144]  We are devastating them.
[03:21:06.314 --> 03:21:10.356]  And so, all I'm asking you to do is support us and pray for us and spread the word.
[03:21:10.396 --> 03:21:13.097]  Even if you can't purchase products, spread the videos, spread the articles.
[03:21:13.437 --> 03:21:14.758]  It's having a giant effect.
[03:21:15.418 --> 03:21:22.342]  And I just ask myself, if we've already gone out of billions of websites to 126, where could we go, David, with Providence?
[03:21:22.898 --> 03:21:34.702]  Well, it's amazing, in the time that I've been here, the four years I've been here, just to see one metric that I can easily look at, and that's the number of people that we have following you on the YouTube channel, how that has skyrocketed.
[03:21:34.762 --> 03:21:36.683]  It's about six times what it was when I started here.
[03:21:37.063 --> 03:21:39.504]  It's amazing to see how that is continuing to grow.
[03:21:39.544 --> 03:21:41.784]  One channel, a billion, one hundred million viewers.
[03:21:42.505 --> 03:21:46.466]  I mean, look, three years ago they came to me and they said, they got the numbers then because the Vice President changed.
[03:21:46.486 --> 03:21:51.388]  I'm not bragging, but listeners should know this, we got a call and they go, the Vice President of YouTube wants to talk to you.
[03:21:52.345 --> 03:21:55.146]  Check him out, he's like one of the top 20 people at YouTube, or Google.
[03:21:55.807 --> 03:21:59.749]  And he goes, yeah, you have 5 billion views, we're going to send you out a signed non-disclosure.
[03:21:59.789 --> 03:22:02.530]  I can't get into all of it, the point is, they let me into the real Google stuff.
[03:22:03.270 --> 03:22:11.374]  And some folks even flew to town, we looked at it, they wanted me, and they go, listen, everybody will be kicked off though, if they don't agree to it, you're going to monetize all this, and it'll be a lot of money.
[03:22:11.494 --> 03:22:14.135]  Because we were all over it, and I said, well, I want to keep spreading it.
[03:22:14.596 --> 03:22:20.118]  And some people will refuse to go under this, I don't want to just say my stuff's free to everybody, and then suddenly claim copyright.
[03:22:20.138 --> 03:22:20.958]  I said, I can't do that.
[03:22:22.347 --> 03:22:24.012]  Okay, well, just at least do your channel.
[03:22:24.353 --> 03:22:27.382]  Which is why they kind of let us alone more on copyright stuff, because it was all BS before.
[03:22:28.464 --> 03:22:30.845]  But, it was five billion, two and a half years ago.
[03:22:31.525 --> 03:22:36.366]  They had a whole map showing it, like in a computer algorithm, in a 360 view of all the stuff they've got, it's incredible.
[03:22:36.787 --> 03:22:38.627]  So, five billion, two and a half years ago.
[03:22:38.747 --> 03:22:40.988]  Five billion videos watched.
[03:22:41.588 --> 03:22:42.668]  So, I mean, imagine.
[03:22:42.688 --> 03:22:43.088]  I can see that.
[03:22:43.189 --> 03:22:47.030]  So, you know, what I see is the tip of the iceberg in the metrics that I see.
[03:22:47.090 --> 03:22:54.272]  I don't typically see these metrics on websites, and even when I look at something that I can follow, like YouTube, it's not a full metric.
[03:22:54.292 --> 03:22:56.713]  Well, hey, it ain't chopped liver, over a billion views on our main channel.
[03:22:56.733 --> 03:22:57.273]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:22:57.893 --> 03:23:00.134]  And Paul Watson's got 300 million views?
[03:23:00.394 --> 03:23:02.334]  You add just our channels together, it's 2 billion views.
[03:23:02.955 --> 03:23:07.416]  But imagine, imagine if two years ago, two and a half years ago, we were 5 billion.
[03:23:07.436 --> 03:23:07.996]  What is it now?
[03:23:08.637 --> 03:23:12.598]  See, we don't get all that supervision of Google and all that, but notice...
[03:23:13.942 --> 03:23:19.788]  Facebook now, Zuckerberg, I'm not crediting him, it's just true, he came out and said, look, we're not just going to ban fake news, it's not that simple.
[03:23:19.808 --> 03:23:23.351]  Because he realizes, most of his traffic is the patriots.
[03:23:23.432 --> 03:23:30.499]  It's like, if you so dominate, where you're the entire organic system, they can't cut you out because you are the system.
[03:23:30.759 --> 03:23:31.940]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:23:31.960 --> 03:23:32.761]  Does that make sense?
[03:23:32.941 --> 03:23:33.642]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[03:23:34.451 --> 03:23:36.333]  Yeah, gonna cut their nose off to spite their face.
[03:23:36.754 --> 03:23:42.060]  And that's what they're doing with Twitter when they do this censorship and we see James Wood saying, well that's it, then I'm gone.
[03:23:42.641 --> 03:23:45.645]  And so he basically just pulled out, said he's boycotting.
[03:23:45.665 --> 03:23:46.846]  Alright, I'm gonna hand this over to you.
[03:23:46.886 --> 03:23:49.229]  We got this big Sandy Hook piece coming up, calls, everything else.
[03:23:49.249 --> 03:23:52.794]  David Knight, are you glad you moved down here from North Carolina three years and four years ago?
[03:23:53.214 --> 03:23:53.854]  It's been amazing.
[03:23:54.095 --> 03:23:58.217]  I really wanted to make a difference, and I think this election cycle, I feel like we really have made a difference, for sure.
[03:23:58.297 --> 03:24:01.719]  And look, selling your house and businesses, you were a successful guy, it was a hassle.
[03:24:01.999 --> 03:24:04.480]  And a few years into it, you're kind of like, eh, but didn't it all pay off?
[03:24:04.520 --> 03:24:05.201]  Yes, yes.
[03:24:05.481 --> 03:24:06.161]  And not in money.
[03:24:06.201 --> 03:24:07.282]  I mean, it paid off, and look at this.
[03:24:07.522 --> 03:24:08.222]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[03:24:08.302 --> 03:24:08.843]  You know what, Alex?
[03:24:09.443 --> 03:24:15.108]  I worked for the longest time trying to make things happen in North Carolina with the Libertarian Party, and it's like, this just isn't working.
[03:24:15.308 --> 03:24:16.189]  It's not happening.
[03:24:16.229 --> 03:24:16.789]  So I quit with that.
[03:24:17.470 --> 03:24:18.471]  This is where it's happening.
[03:24:18.491 --> 03:24:24.495]  You made a bigger difference, one individual, getting out there and educating people, because that's what the Libertarian Party has been doing mostly.
[03:24:24.576 --> 03:24:26.797]  They don't really want to be politicians.
[03:24:26.817 --> 03:24:29.820]  They don't want to control other people's lives, but they want people to wake up.
[03:24:30.140 --> 03:24:34.564]  They want people to take responsibility for themselves, but you were able to do that in this platform.
[03:24:34.964 --> 03:24:39.506]  And really have a major effect, especially in this election, but over the last 20 years.
[03:24:40.066 --> 03:24:42.487]  Even before this election, you had a major, major effect.
[03:24:42.687 --> 03:24:45.107]  But I keep explaining, I'm just genuine.
[03:24:45.288 --> 03:24:46.628]  I mean, I really believe what I'm saying.
[03:24:46.648 --> 03:24:48.589]  People connect to that, but it's the viewers.
[03:24:49.129 --> 03:24:51.910]  I'm just a little focal point that happened to actually pop up.
[03:24:52.730 --> 03:24:54.150]  It's a mirror of all them.
[03:24:54.190 --> 03:24:54.951]  It's like the sun.
[03:24:56.091 --> 03:24:56.611]  I'm a mirror.
[03:24:56.651 --> 03:24:57.352]  They're the sun.
[03:24:57.832 --> 03:24:58.452]  They're the power.
[03:24:58.552 --> 03:25:02.694]  It's like, you know, they're the ones of every race, color, and creed.
[03:25:02.714 --> 03:25:06.896]  It's very humbling, you know, it's very humbling to have all these glowing, wonderful people.
[03:25:06.936 --> 03:25:08.837]  They could be Hispanic, black, white, doesn't matter.
[03:25:09.117 --> 03:25:10.358]  They all have this glow in their eyes.
[03:25:10.378 --> 03:25:10.938]  They're alive.
[03:25:10.958 --> 03:25:11.558]  They're good people.
[03:25:11.618 --> 03:25:13.119]  It's like, I get tears in my eyes.
[03:25:13.159 --> 03:25:14.660]  Last night I took family out to a steakhouse.
[03:25:15.660 --> 03:25:23.669]  And this family came over, they had a Down syndrome daughter and their son, everything, and they were just, they were so proud of me and I was, and I was so humbled by the life in their eyes, the humanity.
[03:25:23.729 --> 03:25:25.711]  I was like, I'll die for these people.
[03:25:26.592 --> 03:25:27.213]  Absolutely.
[03:25:27.253 --> 03:25:27.613]  Well, you know.
[03:25:28.382 --> 03:25:40.095]  We started talking about it from a religious perspective, and I've had missionaries who would go to difficult countries and they would say, I'm going to go there because God's working there.
[03:25:40.115 --> 03:25:41.336]  I can see things happening there.
[03:25:41.376 --> 03:25:42.718]  So you just go where God's working.
[03:25:42.858 --> 03:25:43.559]  That's it.
[03:25:43.579 --> 03:25:46.041]  God is now working in America.
[03:25:46.201 --> 03:25:47.102]  That's right.
[03:25:47.343 --> 03:25:47.883]  It's a big deal.
[03:25:48.204 --> 03:25:49.064]  Appreciate it, David.
[03:25:49.345 --> 03:25:49.805]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:25:50.748 --> 03:25:59.132]  Well, you know, when we look at what's happening with these picks, I'm really happy with this pick of Flynn, also with Sessions.
[03:25:59.412 --> 03:26:08.216]  I'm concerned about Bolton, and I would like to throw something out to Donald Trump if he's listening or anybody is paying attention as we look at this.
[03:26:08.396 --> 03:26:11.238]  You know, he's put in Flynn as a
[03:26:12.418 --> 03:26:13.639]  In an intelligence position.
[03:26:13.999 --> 03:26:19.382]  How about William Binney or Thomas Drake or somebody like that to replace Lion James Clapper?
[03:26:19.582 --> 03:26:20.903]  Because he's leaving.
[03:26:21.503 --> 03:26:22.363]  James Clapper is leaving.
[03:26:22.383 --> 03:26:23.864]  We've got to have somebody who is DNI.
[03:26:24.204 --> 03:26:30.468]  Remember that the DNI, where James Clapper is, that's the guy who's head over the NSA, over the CIA, over
[03:26:30.928 --> 03:26:36.513]  All the military divisions of intelligence, Homeland Security, 16 organizations the DNI is head over.
[03:26:36.713 --> 03:26:45.501]  Remember, James Clapper was the guy that was asked just before the Snowden leaks, he was asked by Senator Ron Wyden, he said, are you listening to Americans?
[03:26:45.701 --> 03:26:52.667]  You know, because we had this big thing back in the 1970s, the Church Commission, we had the Pike Commission, they told people that
[03:26:53.107 --> 03:27:18.910]  The NSA and the FBI, the CIA were illegally monitoring Americans instead of foreign intelligence services, and so they had this thing called the FISA, the FISA Act, okay, that was supposed to keep that under control, and instead what they did was they used that as a tool, as a technique, they inverted it, they perverted it, and they used it as a way to get a search warrant on Mr. and Mrs. Verizon, as Rand Paul pointed out.
[03:27:19.070 --> 03:27:23.614]  Okay, so we've had this situation and it began with James Clapper.
[03:27:23.654 --> 03:27:36.586]  He started in his intelligence service as that thing was starting and now he's coming out where they have first been shut down by the exposure of illegal activity, then they took it over and they made it a tool.
[03:27:36.686 --> 03:27:38.187]  And that's what he's leaving us with.
[03:27:38.487 --> 03:27:42.191]  This guy who lied to the face of Senator Wyden,
[03:27:42.871 --> 03:27:45.133]  And you can see when he asked him that question, he kind of looks down.
[03:27:45.153 --> 03:27:47.715]  I mean, you talk about obvious body language, okay?
[03:27:47.975 --> 03:27:54.821]  You don't have to be a mentalist to take a look at that, read that body language and know what he was saying.
[03:27:54.861 --> 03:27:59.144]  Everybody knew he was lying because we knew they were listening, but you could just watch him as he was lying.
[03:27:59.184 --> 03:28:02.727]  And then it was just a couple of months later that we got the documents from Ed Snowden.
[03:28:03.247 --> 03:28:04.869]  And so I think it's very important.
[03:28:04.909 --> 03:28:07.030]  I think it would be great to have somebody that has
[03:28:07.791 --> 03:28:12.634]  And the integrity of William Binney, who has the love of the Constitution and the rule of law.
[03:28:12.794 --> 03:28:14.294]  See, that's what we're seeing with Jeff Sessions.
[03:28:15.035 --> 03:28:21.078]  We're replacing somebody like Loretta Lynch, who had absolute contempt for the legal system.
[03:28:21.298 --> 03:28:27.301]  Who had absolute contempt for the idea that there would be a standard of justice for everyone.
[03:28:27.381 --> 03:28:32.964]  No, Loretta Lynch and James Comey think there should be one standard for the people at top, who are friends with them.
[03:28:33.504 --> 03:28:34.865]  And a different standard for the rest of you.
[03:28:34.885 --> 03:28:38.028]  Remember, James Comey said she committed all these felonies, but don't you try this at home.
[03:28:38.669 --> 03:28:43.213]  No, we need to have somebody like Jeff Sessions, I think, who is going to be an honest person.
[03:28:43.354 --> 03:28:46.116]  Amazing turnaround to see Jeff Sessions there.
[03:28:46.156 --> 03:28:51.902]  But let's also take a look at some of these people whose names are being floated out there.
[03:28:52.583 --> 03:28:55.085]  Secretary of State, Romney, John Bolton.
[03:28:55.245 --> 03:28:55.686]  Seriously?
[03:28:56.326 --> 03:29:00.108]  I mean, is John Bolton's name being floated out there by people who like John Bolton?
[03:29:00.128 --> 03:29:07.812]  Remember Roger Stone said, you can take with a grain of salt a lot of these names that are going to be thrown out there because it's going to be people who are promoting this individual.
[03:29:08.012 --> 03:29:10.353]  That individual who gets people to promote him that way.
[03:29:11.134 --> 03:29:16.997]  Maybe that's the case, hopefully that's the case with John Bolton, and maybe as bad as Mitt Romney is,
[03:29:18.089 --> 03:29:22.510]  Maybe what they're trying to do is make him look better if Trump is going to do a political appointment.
[03:29:22.530 --> 03:29:23.131]  I hope he doesn't.
[03:29:23.611 --> 03:29:31.073]  I hope he doesn't do a political appointment like Obama put in Hillary Clinton or John Kerry as Secretary of State.
[03:29:31.113 --> 03:29:34.694]  That would be great if we had somebody who was competent instead of just a political appointee.
[03:29:35.274 --> 03:29:46.531]  And when we come back, we're going to play Alex Jones' reply to a daughter of Sandy Hook, one of the Sandy Hook victims, who says that Trump must disavow Alex Jones.
[03:29:46.871 --> 03:29:49.275]  Alex Jones will have his reply right after the break.
[03:29:49.295 --> 03:29:50.357]  Stay with us, you're going to want to hear this.
[03:29:58.806 --> 03:30:01.814]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.737 --> 03:30:05.424]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.949 --> 03:30:15.653]  Donald Trump is not even president yet and he is already cashing in on his word of bringing jobs back to America.
[03:30:15.874 --> 03:30:21.298]  I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
[03:30:21.938 --> 03:30:24.520]  I'll bring back our jobs and I'll bring back our money.
[03:30:24.680 --> 03:30:32.206]  Ford has decided to continue to manufacture its Lincoln MKC in Louisville, Kentucky and not move to Mexico as they had previously planned.
[03:30:32.426 --> 03:30:38.290]  Ford has said they are happy to work with President Trump and are glad he is making American manufacturing competitive and great again.
[03:30:38.530 --> 03:30:42.972]  Reports are also surfacing that Apple is considering manufacturing their iPhones in California.
[03:30:43.233 --> 03:30:49.596]  Apple has asked its Asian-based manufacturers Foxconn and Pegatron to explore manufacturing their iPhones in America.
[03:30:49.736 --> 03:30:53.679]  Are these the first dominoes to get Americans off the welfare state and into the workforce?
[03:30:53.979 --> 03:30:57.882]  Will there be a time when you can pick up an electronic and it says Made in America?
[03:30:58.122 --> 03:31:00.203]  Coming soon to a presidency near you.
[03:31:00.484 --> 03:31:05.347]  I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
[03:31:05.467 --> 03:31:06.828]  I tell you that.
[03:31:06.848 --> 03:31:09.190]  This is Owen Troyer for InfoWars.com

[03:33:24.182 --> 03:33:28.332]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:35.751 --> 03:33:46.536]  This message is not for the fake news media, the corporate news media that got caught lying to us with hundreds of fake polls during the election, lying about Hillary being invincible.
[03:33:47.117 --> 03:33:55.521]  The same folks that got caught doing fake news broadcasts, the same people that got caught with fake guests and interviewing their own reporters.
[03:33:56.587 --> 03:34:01.810]  The same people that got caught giving Hillary the debate questions beforehand, repeatedly.
[03:34:02.050 --> 03:34:03.090]  This is not a message for them.
[03:34:03.511 --> 03:34:04.611]  They're always going to lie.
[03:34:04.671 --> 03:34:05.412]  It's what they do.
[03:34:05.792 --> 03:34:06.632]  They're paid to do it.
[03:34:06.672 --> 03:34:08.033]  It's why they have almost no audience.
[03:34:08.853 --> 03:34:16.678]  But I do want to reach out to the victims of criminal crime out there, whether it be a baseball bat, a car, a gun, a knife.
[03:34:17.958 --> 03:34:28.205]  I want to reach out to my listeners as well and just clarify where I stand on the reported tragedy at Sandy Hook that took place at that elementary school.
[03:34:29.806 --> 03:34:38.292]  For the last three or four years, it's been mainstream media's number one attack against me to say that I said that there was never anyone that actually died there.
[03:34:39.801 --> 03:34:43.706]  I've hosted debates between both sides, and I've been criticized by both sides.
[03:34:44.267 --> 03:34:49.553]  People that say that no one died there, and people that say that the official story is exactly as we've been told.
[03:34:50.859 --> 03:34:58.347]  And I've always said that I'm not sure about what really happened, but there's a lot of anomalies, and there has been a cover-up of whatever did happen there.
[03:34:58.908 --> 03:35:09.779]  There's a few clips Hillary used in her campaign of me out of context, saying, I can see how people that look at all this evidence say, no kids died there, this whole thing's a giant hoax.
[03:35:09.799 --> 03:35:13.222]  But at the same time, there is some evidence people died there.
[03:35:14.076 --> 03:35:16.498]  They take that out of context and misrepresent it.
[03:35:16.878 --> 03:35:19.621]  That's why they're the deceptive corporate media.
[03:35:20.281 --> 03:35:27.988]  But for those that do have an attention span for, say, 10 minutes or so, I will present to you the questions.
[03:35:28.928 --> 03:35:29.889]  And I'm going to be quite frank.
[03:35:30.330 --> 03:35:31.751]  I don't know what really happened.
[03:35:32.671 --> 03:35:33.993]  I know there are real mass shootings.
[03:35:34.093 --> 03:35:35.093]  I know people lose children.
[03:35:35.514 --> 03:35:36.094]  I'm a father.
[03:35:36.194 --> 03:35:36.875]  It hurts my heart.
[03:35:37.856 --> 03:35:39.097]  So I don't know what the truth is.
[03:35:40.615 --> 03:35:46.760]  All I know is the official story of Sandy Hook has more holes in it than Swiss cheese.
[03:35:47.751 --> 03:35:54.296]  There has been a shooting incident of some nature at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
[03:35:55.017 --> 03:36:01.622]  Federal agents say they recovered two high-powered pistols from the scene and a semi-automatic rifle called a Bushmaster.
[03:36:01.842 --> 03:36:11.269]  They say now that there were actually four handguns recovered inside the school, not just two as we were initially told.
[03:36:12.050 --> 03:36:15.552]  All the wounds that I know of at this point were caused by the long weapon.
[03:36:17.558 --> 03:36:19.179]  The rifle was the primary weapon?
[03:36:19.219 --> 03:36:19.439]  Yes.
[03:36:20.219 --> 03:36:28.101]  It's believed at this hour, and it's been confirmed to ABC News by state police there in Connecticut, that two shooters were initially believed involved in the mass shooting.
[03:36:28.161 --> 03:36:29.942]  One of those shooters, now dead.
[03:36:30.142 --> 03:36:31.582]  They did walk a guy out of the woods.
[03:36:31.662 --> 03:36:34.683]  I saw him walk a guy earlier with handcuffs.
[03:36:34.743 --> 03:36:36.304]  He walked by us and said he didn't do it.
[03:36:36.364 --> 03:36:37.464]  It was a grown man.
[03:36:37.504 --> 03:36:38.204]  A grown man, yeah.
[03:36:38.224 --> 03:36:39.905]  He's sitting in the front of the police car over there now.
[03:36:40.405 --> 03:36:41.046]  How is he dressed?
[03:36:41.066 --> 03:36:44.028]  Uh, camo pants with a dark jacket.
[03:36:44.108 --> 03:36:47.551]  Well, they have an individual in custody who they're talking to.
[03:36:47.712 --> 03:36:50.934]  And I am told they are looking at this person as possibly a second shooter.
[03:36:51.275 --> 03:36:53.677]  Now that changes the dynamic here a little bit.
[03:36:54.017 --> 03:36:55.578]  They had their entire lives ahead of them.
[03:36:56.960 --> 03:37:03.025]  Birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own.
[03:37:04.994 --> 03:37:08.757]  I mean, he's a worse actor than Glenn Beck with Glenn Beck's fake crime.
[03:37:09.358 --> 03:37:09.658]  Okay?
[03:37:09.678 --> 03:37:11.499]  I mean, this is disgusting.
[03:37:12.580 --> 03:37:24.250]  Okay.
[03:37:24.270 --> 03:37:25.251]  So my name's Robbie Parker.
[03:37:26.171 --> 03:37:29.294]  One thing that's becoming somewhat of a concern
[03:37:30.203 --> 03:37:35.251]  And that is misinformation that's being posted on social media sites.
[03:37:35.611 --> 03:37:37.133]  These issues are crimes.
[03:37:38.101 --> 03:37:47.527]  They will be investigated statewide and federally, and prosecution will take place when people perpetrating this information are identified.
[03:37:47.807 --> 03:37:52.530]  These are your children, and you would let paramedics and EMTs into the building?
[03:37:53.270 --> 03:37:57.133]  You got 27 children declared dead within eight minutes?
[03:37:57.573 --> 03:37:58.393]  Who does this?
[03:37:58.854 --> 03:38:00.535]  Who is so great at that job?
[03:38:00.975 --> 03:38:05.818]  I don't know if they staged this one, but the same familiar telltale signs are now coming out.
[03:38:08.049 --> 03:38:13.012]  Now to be clear, corporate media wants to misrepresent what I've said, so this is not for them.
[03:38:14.032 --> 03:38:17.374]  I'm going to do my best to lay out my questions here.
[03:38:17.414 --> 03:38:21.016]  I've got more than 20 news articles and video clips to go over.
[03:38:23.298 --> 03:38:30.562]  Number one, the day before this tragic event happened, an email was sent out by Bloomberg's anti-gun group saying, prepare for a big event.
[03:38:32.011 --> 03:38:40.174]  But the biggest piece of evidence, the smoking gun, if you would, of a cover-up, of whatever really happened, is the Wayback Machine, the Internet Archive.
[03:38:40.574 --> 03:38:52.718]  We see Sandy Hook's Newtown website, K-12, having zero traffic, 2008, 9, 10, 11, 12, and then all of a sudden, it just explodes.
[03:38:53.578 --> 03:38:58.200]  It's impossible to have zero traffic to a K-12 entire school system.
[03:39:01.280 --> 03:39:05.424]  And the word is that school system was shut down for those years.
[03:39:05.905 --> 03:39:07.026]  That's what the records show.
[03:39:07.566 --> 03:39:09.848]  But they tell us it was open.
[03:39:12.871 --> 03:39:17.756]  I don't know if the moon landings were faked, but I don't put anything past these anti-gunners.
[03:39:18.357 --> 03:39:23.181]  And early on that day, we watched footage of kids going in circles in and out of the building.
[03:39:24.222 --> 03:39:25.844]  You'd be running them away from the building.
[03:39:27.054 --> 03:39:28.735]  Emergency helicopters weren't called.
[03:39:29.555 --> 03:39:33.757]  Instead, porta-potties were prepared for the press within hours of the event.
[03:39:34.417 --> 03:39:42.601]  I saw the helicopters that did respond, the police helicopters, saying that there were men or a man in the woods in camouflage.
[03:39:43.221 --> 03:39:45.202]  The media later said that was a conspiracy theory.
[03:39:45.882 --> 03:39:50.704]  So early on, I'm like, well, I saw local news of the guy in the woods and they took him in custody.
[03:39:50.744 --> 03:39:51.765]  Now they're saying it never happened.
[03:39:51.805 --> 03:39:54.586]  So that shows there's some of a cover-up happening.
[03:39:55.620 --> 03:39:57.301]  And then I saw Anderson Cooper.
[03:39:58.341 --> 03:39:59.622]  I've been in TV for 20-something years.
[03:39:59.702 --> 03:40:01.022]  I know a blue screen or a green screen.
[03:40:01.362 --> 03:40:04.144]  Turn and his nose disappear.
[03:40:04.924 --> 03:40:16.909]  Then I saw clearly that they were using footage on the green screen looped because it would show flowers and other things during other broadcasts that were moving and then basically cutting to the same piece of footage.
[03:40:17.669 --> 03:40:18.289]  Then I saw CNN.
[03:40:20.143 --> 03:40:30.347]  Do faked satellite interviews with reporters clearly with the same traffic and the same cars right behind them conducting the interview face to face.
[03:40:31.388 --> 03:40:41.952]  Then we see footage of one of the reported fathers of the victims, Robbie Parker, doing classic acting training where he's laughing and joking and they say, hey, we're live.
[03:40:41.972 --> 03:40:42.553]  And he goes, oh.
[03:40:45.134 --> 03:40:46.554]  And maybe that's real.
[03:40:46.674 --> 03:40:47.475]  I'm sure it is.
[03:40:48.687 --> 03:40:51.928]  They're getting ready to come to the microphone, so we'll listen in.
[03:40:51.988 --> 03:40:52.108]  Okay.
[03:41:03.810 --> 03:41:06.390]  My name's Robbie Parker.
[03:41:08.651 --> 03:41:16.972]  My family is one of the families that lost a child yesterday in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting scene in Connecticut.
[03:41:17.796 --> 03:41:39.391]  But you add it to all the other things that were happening and all the other fake news the media has been caught in and CNN back in 1991 openly faking Scud missile attacks on Saudi Arabia and Israel when they were back in Atlanta and the satellite feeds caught them admitting that it was all fake.
[03:41:40.031 --> 03:41:46.396]  We'd be crazy not to question this because bare minimum they were faking some of the shots and some of the coverage.
[03:41:46.816 --> 03:41:49.758]  ...specific given these restrictions, but within those parameters, what did you see?
[03:41:49.918 --> 03:41:52.719]  Well, what I saw, I didn't see anything hit.
[03:41:52.759 --> 03:41:59.903]  I looked very, almost straight above us, and there's a vapor trail coming from my right to my left, and there's a cloud of, uh, something.
[03:41:59.923 --> 03:42:01.404]  It looks like it might have been an explosion.
[03:42:01.484 --> 03:42:05.066]  A cloud, uh, oh, I'd say... What did you see?
[03:42:06.707 --> 03:42:13.770]  I don't know.
[03:42:17.551 --> 03:42:23.494]  So to be clear, we point out clear chroma key, also known as blue screen or green screen, being used and were demonized.
[03:42:24.154 --> 03:42:26.335]  We point out they're clearly doing fake interviews.
[03:42:27.436 --> 03:42:30.558]  We point out that normal emergency procedures weren't followed.
[03:42:31.658 --> 03:42:34.280]  And their answer is to say that we said nobody died.
[03:42:34.300 --> 03:42:41.923]  And ladies and gentlemen, the questions I ask are not offensive to any parent who lost a child that day.
[03:42:42.244 --> 03:42:44.645]  They're not offensive to the Connecticut State Police.
[03:42:44.945 --> 03:42:46.686]  They're not offensive to anyone.
[03:42:47.145 --> 03:42:48.826]  There's such simple questions.
[03:42:50.387 --> 03:42:51.927]  Why no trauma helicopters?
[03:42:53.508 --> 03:43:00.191]  Why would you not let paramedics, board members, these are your children, and you would let paramedics and EMTs into the building?
[03:43:00.891 --> 03:43:04.773]  You got 27 children declared dead within eight minutes?
[03:43:05.193 --> 03:43:06.034]  Who does this?
[03:43:06.474 --> 03:43:08.075]  Who is so great at that job?
[03:43:08.834 --> 03:43:17.403]  Columbine happened in the 1990s when there were less surveillance cameras and we got play-by-play, blow-by-blow, we got the surveillance footage all released.
[03:43:18.485 --> 03:43:20.046]  They sealed the surveillance footage.
[03:43:20.487 --> 03:43:21.928]  They sealed the death certificates.
[03:43:22.009 --> 03:43:27.555]  They sealed everything in Connecticut like it was more secret than the Manhattan Project.
[03:43:28.195 --> 03:43:29.897]  This has never been done in any other case.
[03:43:30.738 --> 03:43:31.739]  Look at the headlines.
[03:43:31.959 --> 03:43:33.580]  Privacy versus transparency.
[03:43:33.620 --> 03:43:37.362]  Connecticut bans access to many homicide records post Newtown.
[03:43:37.782 --> 03:43:41.344]  School shooting expert threatened over Sandy Hook investigation.
[03:43:41.704 --> 03:43:44.126]  Feds came to his house, you name it, said you better drop it.
[03:43:44.626 --> 03:43:47.408]  Newtown destroys suspected Sandy Hook shooter's home.
[03:43:48.308 --> 03:43:53.850]  Turns out he got the gun illegally from his mother and didn't buy it illegal in the open market.
[03:43:54.070 --> 03:43:59.171]  But the media still lies and says he did and filed a lawsuit against Bushmaster.
[03:43:59.852 --> 03:44:06.254]  Then we have the bank burning down Adam Lanza's home so no one could buy it and investigate it.
[03:44:06.834 --> 03:44:10.175]  They didn't just burn down Adam Lanza's home to get rid of it.
[03:44:10.435 --> 03:44:11.975]  They didn't just steal all the records.
[03:44:12.416 --> 03:44:12.856]  No, no, no.
[03:44:12.896 --> 03:44:16.377]  When they demolished the school, they made everybody that was part of it
[03:44:17.452 --> 03:44:18.653]  Signed non-disclosures.
[03:44:19.654 --> 03:44:22.976]  And then this Agatha Christie whodunit gets even weirder.
[03:44:23.596 --> 03:44:40.688]  Rob Due's uncle, respected FBI agent that runs his own big security firm, John Due, Rob Due's uncle, is at the foyer meeting that our reporter's at and tells our reporter he's never seen anything like this before concerning the cover-up.
[03:44:41.149 --> 03:44:43.250]  All these bureaucracies have paper trails.
[03:44:43.631 --> 03:44:44.771]  And it just doesn't add up.
[03:44:44.791 --> 03:44:45.592]  And that's what my uncle said.
[03:44:45.852 --> 03:44:46.973]  Yeah, tell us everything he said.
[03:44:47.153 --> 03:44:48.574]  He said, so I said, what did you think?
[03:44:48.634 --> 03:44:52.775]  He said, well, I've never sat in a court proceeding like this ever in my life.
[03:44:52.896 --> 03:44:53.516]  I said, what do you mean?
[03:44:53.576 --> 03:44:59.518]  He goes, well, he goes, here's you got this small town, the biggest event in their history by far.
[03:44:59.899 --> 03:45:00.919]  And nobody knows nothing.
[03:45:00.999 --> 03:45:02.020]  Nobody remembers anything.
[03:45:02.040 --> 03:45:03.300]  And there's no paperwork for anything.
[03:45:03.360 --> 03:45:06.942]  No, I just don't understand how this is going on in this small town.
[03:45:07.822 --> 03:45:09.383]  And what do you mean?
[03:45:09.403 --> 03:45:16.106]  He goes, well, he goes, even, he goes, even when we were, you know, going after the mob, he goes, they would remember.
[03:45:16.786 --> 03:45:20.388]  Well, he didn't say Gotti, but I remember back in the day, my dad taught, he was, you know, working on.
[03:45:20.408 --> 03:45:21.128]  So it was Gotti.
[03:45:21.188 --> 03:45:21.348]  Yeah.
[03:45:21.388 --> 03:45:26.711]  Well, one of the guys, it was, there was a lot of different mobsters they were going after back in the eighties and nineties.
[03:45:26.751 --> 03:45:28.612]  I guess he, he retired sometime in the nineties.
[03:45:29.412 --> 03:45:32.853]  Um, but he said, you know, we never had a case where nobody knew nothing.
[03:45:33.313 --> 03:45:35.474]  You know, he said, I just couldn't understand it.
[03:45:35.794 --> 03:45:38.114]  How in this small town, nobody knows anything.
[03:45:38.174 --> 03:45:39.434]  The school board guy doesn't know anything.
[03:45:39.454 --> 03:45:40.795]  The maintenance guy doesn't know anything.
[03:45:41.355 --> 03:45:43.115]  Uh, the head select woman doesn't know anything.
[03:45:43.976 --> 03:45:46.456]  Stuff is being delivered and nobody knows how I got there.
[03:45:46.556 --> 03:45:48.437]  So this town's mascot is Sergeant Schultz?
[03:45:48.877 --> 03:45:49.597]  Essentially, yeah.
[03:45:50.677 --> 03:45:54.478]  You know, you learn a lot over the years running a major media operation like InfoWars.
[03:45:55.258 --> 03:46:03.060]  And one thing I've discovered is that when MSM attacks you on something, a lot of times it's because it's your strongest information.
[03:46:03.780 --> 03:46:05.680]  And they want to discourage you from covering it.
[03:46:06.180 --> 03:46:09.341]  They want to make you think that you're discredited because you're talking about it.
[03:46:09.361 --> 03:46:12.042]  It's kind of like saying, oh, you're all discredited because you're for Trump.
[03:46:12.402 --> 03:46:13.822]  He's going to lose by 20 points.
[03:46:13.902 --> 03:46:15.122]  Everybody knows he's a loser.
[03:46:15.703 --> 03:46:17.183]  Even though internal polls showed him losing.
[03:46:18.356 --> 03:46:19.917]  And it's the same thing with this Sandy Hook.
[03:46:20.117 --> 03:46:21.337]  I've moved on from this story.
[03:46:21.858 --> 03:46:25.620]  But they're always attacking, saying, I'm going after family members of victims.
[03:46:28.841 --> 03:46:29.682]  This is a tragedy.
[03:46:30.982 --> 03:46:32.043]  I wish it never would have happened.
[03:46:32.944 --> 03:46:40.550]  But quite frankly, I wish that the official story was true, because that's a lot less scary than them staging something like this.
[03:46:40.630 --> 03:46:55.122]  But when you think about how they staged WMDs to kill over a million Iraqis, if you think about all the other hoaxes, all the other lies, all the other rigging, and the way they're freaking out about it and trying to cover up every level of it, it just makes me ask, what really happened there?
[03:46:55.182 --> 03:47:00.126]  Because I've hosted debates, as I said, and said that I don't know what really happened.
[03:47:01.323 --> 03:47:16.916]  When I sit there and read quotes of other people saying they believe it's staged, the media knows full well they take that out of context and have me definitively saying it, when I've always said I don't know what happened there, but it needs to be looked into.
[03:47:18.024 --> 03:47:22.828]  And why should anybody fear an investigation if they have nothing to hide?
[03:47:22.888 --> 03:47:24.530]  In fact, isn't that in Shakespeare's Hamlet?
[03:47:25.230 --> 03:47:27.432]  Methinks you protest too much.
[03:47:27.512 --> 03:47:33.237]  So, here is my statement for the media when they call up, saying, where do you stand on this?
[03:47:33.937 --> 03:47:35.098]  Where I've always stood.
[03:47:36.560 --> 03:47:43.145]  When there were other mass shootings, I would simply point out that they're very rare statistically, and why should we all give up our rights?
[03:47:43.465 --> 03:47:44.967]  Because some other bad person does something.
[03:47:46.280 --> 03:47:47.842]  A guy with a car runs over 50 people.
[03:47:47.882 --> 03:47:48.963]  Do we ban driving cars?
[03:47:48.983 --> 03:47:50.124]  It's the same thing.
[03:47:50.665 --> 03:47:53.608]  And there have been other instances of shootings that are very suspicious.
[03:47:54.149 --> 03:47:55.030]  Aurora is one.
[03:47:55.270 --> 03:47:55.951]  Just look into that.
[03:47:56.091 --> 03:48:00.857]  But this particular case, they are so scared of an investigation.
[03:48:02.122 --> 03:48:04.984]  So everything they do basically ends up blowing up in their face.
[03:48:05.625 --> 03:48:07.186]  So you guys are going to get what you want now.
[03:48:07.246 --> 03:48:11.409]  I'm going to start reinvestigating Sandy Hook and everything else that happened with it.
[03:48:12.050 --> 03:48:14.252]  I'm Alex Jones signing off from fullwars.com.
[03:48:14.812 --> 03:48:16.874]  If you're watching this transmission, think for yourself.
[03:48:16.954 --> 03:48:17.894]  I know it's a thought crime.
[03:48:18.655 --> 03:48:24.219]  And then ask yourself, what is it so strange about Sandy Hook?
[03:48:25.225 --> 03:48:25.925]  And that tragedy.
[03:48:26.966 --> 03:48:46.975]  But I will say this, finally, my heart does go out to all parents that lose children, whether it's to stabbings, or whether it's to car wrecks, or whether it's to stranglings, or whether it's to blunt force trauma, or murder, firearms, whatever the case is, I'm a parent and my heart goes out to all parents that have lost children in these tragic events.
[03:48:47.115 --> 03:48:49.797]  And so, if children were lost in Sandy Hook,
[03:48:50.837 --> 03:48:57.924]  My heart goes out to each and every one of those parents and the people that say they're parents that I see on the news.
[03:49:00.086 --> 03:49:02.529]  The only problem is I've watched a lot of soap operas.
[03:49:03.650 --> 03:49:04.691]  And I've seen actors before.
[03:49:04.731 --> 03:49:08.214]  And I know when I'm watching a movie, I don't know when I'm watching something real.
[03:49:11.718 --> 03:49:12.619]  Let's look at Sandy Hook.
[03:49:17.022 --> 03:49:27.974]  Alright, that's Alex Jones' response to a call for Trump to distance himself from Alex Jones because we questioned the events, the official story, and Sandy Hook.
[03:49:28.014 --> 03:49:30.557]  And you know, that's the whole thing going back to the JFK assassination.
[03:49:31.077 --> 03:49:33.220]  The CIA, or rather the FBI.
[03:49:34.381 --> 03:49:49.217]  Actually, it's the CIA that came up with the conspiracy theory because if you didn't believe in the magic bullet theory, if you thought that there was more than just one shooter operating a bolt-action rifle, you know, you were a conspiracy theorist.
[03:49:49.677 --> 03:49:50.918]  It's a gaslighting tactic.
[03:49:51.679 --> 03:50:06.543]  We have to understand, one of the things that we're about here at InfoWars, and we're not going to back away from this, even if it's something that hurts us, you know, Alex took a lot of flak, still does, for pointing out the inconsistencies, the lies of 9-11.
[03:50:06.623 --> 03:50:13.464]  We had three steel buildings that fell down, never happened before or since, and only two of them were even hit by a plane.
[03:50:13.524 --> 03:50:14.284]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:50:14.304 --> 03:50:20.246]  And of course you've got the guy who owned the third one saying, pull it down, but, and we've got witnesses saying, yeah, we heard explosions and so forth.
[03:50:21.266 --> 03:50:22.526]  Don't look anymore at that.
[03:50:22.566 --> 03:50:25.167]  Just move away, and if you do, we're going to ridicule you.
[03:50:25.247 --> 03:50:26.968]  We're going to call you a conspiracy theorist.
[03:50:27.008 --> 03:50:30.689]  Or now, the new gaslighting term is going to be fake news, hoax news.
[03:50:30.729 --> 03:50:36.871]  No, we're going to look at this, and when we see anomalies, as Alex Jones just pointed out in that video,
[03:50:37.847 --> 03:50:42.871]  We're going to point out those, and we're going to ask questions, and we're going to expect some reasonable explanations.
[03:50:42.991 --> 03:50:46.234]  And if we don't get them, then it becomes even more suspicious.
[03:50:46.254 --> 03:50:47.916]  You know the guy that was in there, Wolfgang Halbig?
[03:50:48.456 --> 03:50:50.818]  He was there because he had been a law enforcement officer.
[03:50:50.858 --> 03:50:56.223]  He'd also been a school administrator, and then he combined those two to investigate school shootings like Columbine.
[03:50:56.243 --> 03:50:57.324]  That's what he did for a living.
[03:50:57.624 --> 03:51:00.366]  He'd never seen anything like that before, just like Rob Doo's uncle.
[03:51:00.386 --> 03:51:00.747]  Stay with us.
[03:51:00.767 --> 03:51:03.109]  We're going to talk about some of these Trump appointments when we come back.
[03:51:03.129 --> 03:51:03.669]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:09.651 --> 03:51:13.799]  I mentioned this on the show before, bringing back life to the inner cities in America.
[03:51:14.240 --> 03:51:16.504]  Of course, that means bringing jobs back home.
[03:51:17.105 --> 03:51:21.312]  But you know, the other day I looked on a search engine and I found in Chicago...
[03:51:22.541 --> 03:51:27.285]  Not just an urban farm, but a directory of urban farms.
[03:51:27.825 --> 03:51:38.314]  I saw at least eight of these local operations that are all geared to growing fresh nutritious food for people, by people who live there and so on and so forth.
[03:51:38.995 --> 03:51:40.616]  That's a revolution right there.
[03:51:41.417 --> 03:51:48.443]  Let's put a hundred, a thousand, five thousand of these urban farms in inner cities across America for a pittance.
[03:51:49.295 --> 03:51:52.197]  People themselves could form them as businesses and make money.
[03:51:52.758 --> 03:51:55.520]  If Trump is listening to this, here's a clue.
[03:51:55.940 --> 03:51:57.881]  You want to bring back inner cities?
[03:51:58.662 --> 03:52:08.990]  Of course you offer people jobs, good jobs, and also programs like this that for a tiny amount of money can reverse life completely in these inner cities.
[03:52:09.590 --> 03:52:10.411]  So I think
[03:52:11.784 --> 03:52:22.917]  That the new administration in Washington, if they have a clue about anything, and they seem to, are going to be listening to people like us because we've been looking at solutions all along.
[03:52:23.607 --> 03:52:24.828]  This is nothing new for us.
[03:52:24.908 --> 03:52:30.793]  Just point out to the people that very quickly they can make this into a profit making business of their own.
[03:52:31.233 --> 03:52:36.617]  So they can eat fresh nutritious food that they grow for nothing and then they can sell the food.
[03:52:37.218 --> 03:52:40.940]  And all of a sudden you've got free market coming back into the inner cities.
[03:52:41.060 --> 03:52:44.123]  And my feeling is, and I mentioned this to a couple of friends yesterday,
[03:52:45.111 --> 03:52:52.273]  If you're living in an inner city and all of a sudden it starts to blossom with, you know, one of these, several of these enterprises.
[03:52:53.133 --> 03:52:58.954]  Growing food naturally, growing it outdoors, growing it in abandoned buildings, growing it in all kinds of places.
[03:52:59.735 --> 03:53:06.056]  Now, the people that live there are invested in that community in a way that they've never been before in their memory.
[03:53:06.876 --> 03:53:11.497]  Now they're feeding themselves and growing food and selling the food and making a profit.
[03:53:11.837 --> 03:53:12.618]  They're in business.
[03:53:13.198 --> 03:53:13.758]  And now,
[03:53:15.150 --> 03:53:16.258]  Their demand.
[03:53:17.896 --> 03:53:29.744]  The level of their demand to live in a safe community, free of thugs and gangs and drugs and so forth, reaches a new peak level that it's never been at before.
[03:53:30.324 --> 03:53:35.187]  This is not just, I want the freedom to be able to go down to the A.M.P.M.
[03:53:35.247 --> 03:53:37.449]  because that's the only store that's there.
[03:53:37.989 --> 03:53:38.609]  You know, no.
[03:53:39.170 --> 03:53:45.514]  We've got something to protect now that's real, that's feeding us and making us money on a true product.
[03:53:46.014 --> 03:53:49.497]  Now you're going to see life in those inner cities completely transformed.
[03:53:49.657 --> 03:54:01.067]  What solutions can we feed this new movement that has developed using Trump in a way as a symbol, you know, whatever else you want to say.
[03:54:01.087 --> 03:54:01.707]  A battering ram.
[03:54:02.628 --> 03:54:03.449]  A battering ram.
[03:54:03.689 --> 03:54:05.130]  The movement is gigantic.
[03:54:05.270 --> 03:54:07.372]  It got its legs under it with Ron Paul.
[03:54:07.873 --> 03:54:09.354]  These are many of the same people.
[03:54:17.034 --> 03:54:18.315]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:18.335 --> 03:54:18.715]  I'm David Knight.
[03:54:18.735 --> 03:54:25.099]  I want to talk about some possible picks that are coming up from Donald Trump's cabinet, as well as appointments, other appointments.
[03:54:25.399 --> 03:54:31.402]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to let you know of some of the products that we've put on sale, some of the new introductions that we've had as well.
[03:54:31.422 --> 03:54:34.164]  We've got a Trump Is My President shirt.
[03:54:34.324 --> 03:54:35.324]  It's now been reduced to $9.95.
[03:54:36.065 --> 03:54:37.505]  That's going very quickly.
[03:54:37.525 --> 03:54:38.446]  It's not going to last very long.
[03:54:38.486 --> 03:54:40.087]  It's a collector's edition.
[03:54:40.607 --> 03:54:43.348]  And we now have it at a blowout price.
[03:54:43.408 --> 03:54:49.731]  It's amazing how prescient this was, because now we've got the protesters out there saying, Trump is not my president.
[03:54:49.771 --> 03:54:50.812]  No, actually, he is.
[03:54:50.832 --> 03:54:52.773]  So this is a great souvenir.
[03:54:53.233 --> 03:54:55.274]  It's a way to push back against that as well.
[03:54:55.374 --> 03:54:58.275]  Also, new product, BrainForce, a new formulation.
[03:54:58.815 --> 03:55:01.717]  BrainForce Plus has arrived at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:55:01.757 --> 03:55:04.438]  As I've said many times, it's my favorite supplement that we have here.
[03:55:04.918 --> 03:55:14.602]  I take most of the supplements because I do my research, I understand the need for certain supplements and things that I don't get in my daily diet.
[03:55:15.202 --> 03:55:19.283]  Important things like selenium and other things that you're not going to feel anything when you take selenium, okay?
[03:55:19.303 --> 03:55:23.125]  You're just going to not get sick as we've seen from many studies.
[03:55:23.425 --> 03:55:26.566]  It's going to help you to fight disease, it's going to boost your immune system, that sort of thing.
[03:55:26.946 --> 03:55:28.787]  But with Brain Force, I really do feel it.
[03:55:28.827 --> 03:55:30.668]  It does focus my mind when I take it.
[03:55:30.968 --> 03:55:33.930]  And we now have a new formulation, Brain Force Plus.
[03:55:34.370 --> 03:55:38.232]  It is a new supercharger ingredient, black pepper extract.
[03:55:38.292 --> 03:55:40.934]  It's a higher concentration formula for maximum potency.
[03:55:41.414 --> 03:55:44.676]  And there are 20% more capsules per bottle.
[03:55:45.276 --> 03:55:49.260]  So it's a win-win all the way around, as Alex likes to point out, a 360 win.
[03:55:49.780 --> 03:55:58.228]  And finally, we have a new InfoWars Prime app that we're rolling out, and we have a limited-time half-price introduction.
[03:55:58.608 --> 03:56:06.996]  Again, you can go to InfoWars.com forward slash app, or to the stores for Apple and Android phones, and you can purchase that app.
[03:56:07.316 --> 03:56:11.321]  It's a way that you can get exclusive videos from me, from the rest of the crew, from Alex Jones.
[03:56:11.341 --> 03:56:12.782]  You can see behind the scenes.

[03:56:17.247 --> 03:56:20.531]  So you'll get behind the scenes, up close comments about what's going on.
[03:56:20.551 --> 03:56:22.272]  I've got a report that I'm going to put on there about...
[03:56:23.173 --> 03:56:23.934]  A secret building.
[03:56:23.954 --> 03:56:28.937]  It was an interesting secret building that came out, a report that came out on the Drudge Report.
[03:56:28.957 --> 03:56:29.617]  It was The Intercept.
[03:56:29.657 --> 03:56:36.822]  He picked it up, I think it was Wednesday night, talking about how they discovered this kind of dark skyscraper in the center of New York City.
[03:56:37.082 --> 03:56:39.944]  Well, you know, we had the same sort of thing very close to where I lived in North Carolina.
[03:56:40.264 --> 03:56:43.406]  I'm going to tell you about that on InfoWars Prime app.
[03:56:43.906 --> 03:56:52.530]  The connection between these two AT&T facilities and so I've got things like that that I'm going to be talking about and of course our other reporters will have that kind of content.
[03:56:52.550 --> 03:56:57.612]  You'll only get that at InfoWars Prime app and it is half off right now as we roll that out.
[03:56:57.932 --> 03:57:07.156]  Now in the time we've got left, real quickly, we're looking at the way that they're pushing back against these appointments and I, as I've said before, I have the utmost respect for Senator Sessions.
[03:57:07.176 --> 03:57:10.638]  He's the only senator who had the integrity to look at this sweeping
[03:57:11.358 --> 03:57:14.302]  Trade Treaty called TPP or TTIP.
[03:57:14.722 --> 03:57:16.725]  He took the time to read it, nobody else did.
[03:57:16.925 --> 03:57:29.540]  And not only that, but he was so outraged by what he saw in terms of loss of sovereignty that our economy would be managed by a committee that was appointed by these multinational corporations that had secretly written this treaty.
[03:57:30.400 --> 03:57:33.643]  They would decide who was going to be in the treaty.
[03:57:33.663 --> 03:57:34.884]  They could add China later on.
[03:57:34.904 --> 03:57:37.446]  It wasn't a balance against China.
[03:57:37.787 --> 03:57:42.471]  They would also be able to decide which countries would rise and fall, which industries would rise and fall.
[03:57:42.531 --> 03:57:43.992]  It's a total loss of sovereignty.
[03:57:44.332 --> 03:57:45.493]  There were so many things in it.
[03:57:45.553 --> 03:57:49.677]  He created a massive presentation that he gave to the Senate.
[03:57:49.717 --> 03:57:50.678]  Nobody cared in the Senate.
[03:57:51.078 --> 03:57:54.021]  So he goes in, he's the only one who reads it, and he says, hey guys, you've got to see this.
[03:57:54.501 --> 03:57:56.203]  Nobody would listen to him but Donald Trump.
[03:57:56.963 --> 03:58:00.805]  You know, Senator Sessions never endorsed anybody before Donald Trump.
[03:58:00.825 --> 03:58:06.388]  He endorsed Donald Trump, and he explained to Donald Trump the true issues behind that, the constitutional issues behind it.
[03:58:06.728 --> 03:58:19.695]  And so when they come out and say, well, you know, this guy is a racist, attacking him like they do Breitbart, and you've got this woman saying, well, you know, there were some allegations about a couple of things that he said 30 years ago, so he's a racist, and it's like, really?
[03:58:20.095 --> 03:58:20.696]  Allegations?
[03:58:21.276 --> 03:58:24.818]  She said there's no statute of limitations on racism.
[03:58:25.578 --> 03:58:30.559]  And I heard that, and I thought, oh, so there wasn't any statute of limitations on Robert Byrd, were there?
[03:58:30.579 --> 03:58:31.600]  Okay?
[03:58:31.960 --> 03:58:34.620]  The Ku Klux Klan guy that Hillary and Bill loved, okay?
[03:58:34.640 --> 03:58:42.342]  This is a guy who was an exalted cyclops, a founder of Ku Klux Klan branches, but the Democrats had no problem with that guy.
[03:58:42.843 --> 03:58:47.224]  These are some minor allegations compared to that, and they're just allegations, unproven.
