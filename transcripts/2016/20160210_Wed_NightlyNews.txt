[00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:21.546]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.626 --> 00:00:22.847]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.167 --> 00:00:26.829]  It is February 10th, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:29.951 --> 00:00:43.059]  Tonight, InfoWars confronts Jeb Bush on the classified 28 pages of the congressional inquiry into the September 11th attacks, and his reaction is priceless.
[00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:47.041]  Would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted from the 9-11 commission report?
[00:00:47.081 --> 00:00:47.281]  Yes, sir.
[00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:48.542]  Would you be willing to see those released?
[00:00:49.352 --> 00:00:51.713]  Yeah, I'd like to see him.
[00:00:51.773 --> 00:00:52.153]  You got him?
[00:00:52.173 --> 00:00:53.673]  Uh, well, we may have him.
[00:00:53.693 --> 00:00:54.974]  Plus, what are the 28 pages?
[00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:59.395]  And why is the federal government afraid to release the documents?
[00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:08.078]  Then, Bernie Sanders supporters feel the burn with permanent tattoos in support of the socialist candidate.
[00:01:08.398 --> 00:01:15.501]  And an army of former sex slaves prepare to launch a major assault against ISIS.
[00:01:16.161 --> 00:01:20.303]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:20.763 --> 00:01:25.686]  Mr. President, I call you a liar.
[00:02:00.503 --> 00:02:01.624]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:03.206]  You can't survive without it.
[00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:04.308]  But where do you get it?
[00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:10.375]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:16.302]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:33.360]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.881]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:37.441]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:02:37.721 --> 00:02:38.502]  Easy assembly.
[00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:39.362]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:39.662 --> 00:02:41.482]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:03:03.885 --> 00:03:04.365]  Welcome back.
[00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:09.030]  And we'd like to thank everybody who joined us last night for New Hampshire's primary results.
[00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.536]  And if you missed it, Bernie Sanders came out on top for the Democrats and Donald Trump came out on top for the Republicans.
[00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:22.302]  Now, it was a very interesting deal, particularly when you look at Bernie Sanders, because before the race even began, before the primary
[00:03:22.842 --> 00:03:23.562]  Even began.
[00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:26.443]  Hillary already had, I believe, six or so delegates.
[00:03:26.503 --> 00:03:29.904]  And that's due to the super delegate process, is my understanding of it.
[00:03:30.324 --> 00:03:32.545]  So Bernie really had an uphill battle.
[00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:35.305]  But it's not to say that people aren't supporting Mrs. Clinton.
[00:03:35.586 --> 00:03:41.087]  Very much the contrary to that, people are actually getting Mrs. Clinton tattooed on their bodies.
[00:03:41.107 --> 00:03:44.648]  They're so passionate about her being the next president of the United States.
[00:03:45.108 --> 00:03:49.609]  And we see an article from the Daily Caller where they actually talked to a woman who had HRC 2016 tattooed on her wrist.
[00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.252]  They asked her, why would you do this?
[00:03:54.292 --> 00:03:59.697]  She said, because she's a woman, at least she's honest on that one, and she's the best qualified for the job right now.
[00:04:00.077 --> 00:04:02.980]  And she went on to say that Sanders supporters are naive.
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:13.510]  Now, I will agree with her that a lot of Sanders supporters are naive, because I've gone out and I've talked to people, and just like this lady right here, she admitted that she was voting for Hillary because she's a woman.
[00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.814]  I talked to people at UT, they're quite honest, they say, yeah, I'm voting for Hillary because she's a woman as well.
[00:04:18.214 --> 00:04:20.856]  But the Sanders supporters, you ask them, why are they voting for Bernie?
[00:04:20.876 --> 00:04:22.698]  They say, well, he's going to give me a bunch of free stuff.
[00:04:22.718 --> 00:04:23.959]  I'm like, well, who's going to pay for this stuff?
[00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:25.280]  Well, the rich people of America.
[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.524]  Even if you go to Bernie's own website, which I actually did last night, this is how I know this.
[00:04:30.144 --> 00:04:36.369]  Yes, he does target the 1% or whatever they refer to them as, but it also targets people who make $250,000 a year.
[00:04:39.352 --> 00:04:44.954]  And $250,000 a year is a lot more than the average American household, but it is very far from being a one percenter.
[00:04:44.974 --> 00:04:47.576]  You're nowhere near the Billionaire's Club making $250,000 a year.
[00:04:47.676 --> 00:04:57.561]  It's like if anybody wants to go out of the middle class and go up to the upper class, they have somebody come and snatch them back down through these tax revenue regulations.
[00:04:58.021 --> 00:05:02.570]  And also people are feeling the burn, quite literally, because they're getting Bernie Sanders tattoos.
[00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.554]  They're giving these away free in Vermont.
[00:05:04.574 --> 00:05:08.521]  There's a shop up there where you can go and get your Bernie Sanders tattoo, and it's all the rage.
[00:05:09.705 --> 00:05:18.491]  And the proprietor said, you know, he just wants people to understand that, you know, Bernie Sanders is the guy for the job, in his opinion, and he's giving out the free Bernie Sanders tattoo.
[00:05:19.011 --> 00:05:24.995]  And since we're talking about all the free goodies, let's talk about the state of Maine, where now they're making welfare recipients work for it.
[00:05:25.015 --> 00:05:28.798]  They're making you go out and do volunteer work, and you won't believe what happens here.
[00:05:29.118 --> 00:05:38.164]  This is a report from Louder with Crowder, and it says basically there are plenty of job openings for, I guess, what you would call low-skilled workers, people who work at fast food restaurants and all that.
[00:05:38.644 --> 00:05:45.548]  They say recipients cannot find immediate employment, so Maine is offering people both job training and community service slots.
[00:05:46.088 --> 00:05:57.375]  But despite vigorous outreach efforts by the government to encourage participation, most childless adult recipients in Maine refuse to participate in the training or even perform community service for six hours a week.
[00:05:57.955 --> 00:06:01.358]  But when they refused to participate, they lost their food stamp benefits.
[00:06:01.798 --> 00:06:10.786]  And it says the first three months after Maine's work policy went into effect, its caseload of able-bodied adults without dependents plummeted by 80%, falling from about 13,000 to about 3,000 in March of 2015.
[00:06:10.826 --> 00:06:11.927]  So yeah, when you tell people that
[00:06:18.353 --> 00:06:19.254]  You know, you don't even have to worry.
[00:06:19.274 --> 00:06:19.794]  You can come out here.
[00:06:19.814 --> 00:06:22.095]  You can be a crossing guard at a school.
[00:06:22.116 --> 00:06:26.178]  You can go pick up trash on the side of the highway for, you know, six hours a week.
[00:06:26.478 --> 00:06:27.739]  There's just too much for some people.
[00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:30.981]  And once again, we're talking about abled, bodied, single adults.
[00:06:31.001 --> 00:06:35.264]  We're not talking about, you know, some mom with three kids who probably needs help or somebody with a disability.
[00:06:35.284 --> 00:06:36.545]  They can't go out and get a normal job.
[00:06:36.565 --> 00:06:37.526]  They probably need help as well.
[00:06:37.566 --> 00:06:44.410]  I understand those situations, but we're talking about abled, bodied, you know, strong guys, strong women can go out and do a job if they so chose.
[00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.353]  But no, I'd rather sit at the house and eat Cheetos and, you know, watch YouTube videos.
[00:06:48.353 --> 00:06:49.174]  We're good to go.
[00:07:05.484 --> 00:07:16.056]  I understand there are definitely people who do need help, but you have people who victimize the situation, they take advantage of the situation, and they're living off the American taxpayer, and I'm not okay with that one bit.
[00:07:16.316 --> 00:07:26.588]  I don't mind giving a homeless guy a dollar, but to some college kid or college-aged kid who's just living in his mom's basement and doesn't feel like doing anything, I'm not trying to support this guy's halo habit.
[00:07:27.264 --> 00:07:28.305]  Now let's talk about something else.
[00:07:28.325 --> 00:07:29.426]  Let's go south of the border.
[00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:33.548]  We've seen a lot of talk from guys like Trump saying, let's build a wall.
[00:07:33.769 --> 00:07:45.517]  And I'm against building a wall for the simple fact that he's going to make, or in his own words, he's going to make Mexico pay him to build a wall, which is to say President Trump would make money off the wall to be a never ending construction project.
[00:07:45.557 --> 00:07:49.440]  And that alone is enough for me to kind of be a little bit leery of the guy.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:56.123]  But another thing going on south of the border, HSBC is being accused of laundering money for drug cartels.
[00:07:56.163 --> 00:08:03.867]  So when the drug cartels aren't getting their 50 caliber rifles, courtesy of the ATF, they're having HSBC launder their money, allegedly.
[00:08:04.267 --> 00:08:19.014]  And now we see HSBC holding PLC has been sued by families of American citizens killed in Mexican drug cartel shootouts, who allege that the bank is helping drug cartels launder money to run their businesses and thus can be held responsible for the deaths.
[00:08:19.474 --> 00:08:31.316]  Reports on Tuesday, the bank paid $1.9 billion fine in 2012 to settle a criminal probe into whether it had laundered at least $881 million on behalf of drug cartels.
[00:08:31.336 --> 00:08:43.819]  Like I said, this is something I've been hearing for a while, so I'm very happy to see that the families are actually going after HSBC, who is laundering this money, because they'll do things that are, in my opinion, kind of butt backwards, as they would refer to here in the state of Texas.
[00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:47.642]  You know, somebody gets killed by a gun, and then they want to go sue Bushmaster.
[00:08:47.682 --> 00:08:49.904]  I'm like, Bushmaster did not kill your daughter.
[00:08:49.944 --> 00:08:52.806]  I'm very sorry that your daughter or your son died, but they didn't pull the trigger.
[00:08:53.146 --> 00:08:56.489]  Now, if the gun was defective and it blew up in somebody's hand and somebody died, yeah, that's fine.
[00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:57.570]  Same thing with a car.
[00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:11.522]  If you use your car correctly, if the car was perfectly, you know, mechanically healthy, but somebody uses the vehicle to run over people in the city of Las Vegas, it's not Ford or Chevy or Mitsubishi or whoever else's fault that this person used the car in that way.
[00:09:12.142 --> 00:09:19.165]  Very happy to see that the families are going to the source of the issue, or one of the sources of the issue, once again, and go take us through things with the Justice Department.
[00:09:19.705 --> 00:09:27.468]  Now, when we talk about people taking up arms, this is why you need a Second Amendment, why you need a right to bear arms, not just here, but all around the world.
[00:09:27.508 --> 00:09:40.154]  We see former sex slaves are picking up weapons to defeat ISIS, because we know that ISIS has been running wild, they've been running rampant, they've been picking up sex slaves, making kids into child soldiers, but now they say they have a force.
[00:09:40.814 --> 00:09:41.454]  I think so.
[00:10:02.366 --> 00:10:05.449]  You know, it's very traumatizing for these people to be sex victims.
[00:10:05.489 --> 00:10:16.218]  The article goes on to point out that many people just committed suicide, or they threw their kids off of mountains and things like that, so they wouldn't be victims to this ISIS slavery.
[00:10:16.559 --> 00:10:22.424]  But these women, they survived the assault, they survived the attack of ISIS, and now they're going to fight ISIS.
[00:10:22.464 --> 00:10:26.628]  Because we've seen all the videos, the propaganda videos, you know, they're lighting guys on fire.
[00:10:27.448 --> 00:10:35.690]  They're blowing up churches, you know, killing priests, running people over with steam rollers and all types of just horrific, crazy things.
[00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:39.651]  Meanwhile, they're getting missiles and grenades airdropped to them by Western governments.
[00:10:40.231 --> 00:10:46.613]  You got Al Qaeda rebels, aka the Syrian rebels, singing songs about how great Osama bin Laden is.
[00:10:46.773 --> 00:10:48.613]  It's a very horrific situation.
[00:10:49.053 --> 00:10:51.614]  And this is the reason why many people are leaving the Middle East.
[00:10:51.974 --> 00:10:55.835]  And people like Dave, they'll watch a show like this and they'll hear us talking about, you know, people coming
[00:10:56.215 --> 00:10:56.735]  To the country.
[00:10:56.855 --> 00:11:00.717]  I have no issue with people who come to the country because I understand why they're coming here.
[00:11:00.737 --> 00:11:03.798]  They're coming here from these Middle Eastern countries because ISIS is out there.
[00:11:04.138 --> 00:11:07.979]  They're coming from Mexico because we're giving guns to the Sinaloa drug cartel.
[00:11:07.999 --> 00:11:10.560]  They got .50 caliber rifles, courtesy of the ATF.
[00:11:11.556 --> 00:11:29.268]  So I understand that they're coming for those reasons, but the thing that nobody ever wants to talk about, the elephant in the room, or I guess more accurately in this case, the Democrat in the room, is the fact that the Obama administration continues to give weapons to ISIS, cartels, whoever, and make the situation worse using your tax dollars.
[00:11:29.609 --> 00:11:33.712]  And then when the people want to come here, they say, well, use more of your tax dollars to clean up the mess that I made.
[00:11:33.812 --> 00:11:37.074]  And at no point does anybody ever take responsibility.
[00:11:37.154 --> 00:11:38.115]  Nobody goes to prison.
[00:11:38.895 --> 00:11:40.977]  Nobody takes a pay cut to pay for all this stuff.
[00:11:41.217 --> 00:11:47.641]  No, they just say, you the American taxpayer, you just get more and more and more of your means to just clean up the mess that we made.
[00:11:47.661 --> 00:11:50.623]  It gives us a bad reputation in the international community.
[00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:55.166]  It gives us a black eye around the world, and nobody wants to take responsibility of it.
[00:11:55.547 --> 00:11:59.189]  And this is one of the ways they try to scapegoat this onto the American taxpayer.
[00:11:59.529 --> 00:12:04.152]  They have things like the DOJ come out with this massive budget that Obama is trying to push.
[00:12:04.192 --> 00:12:06.154]  Luckily, the Republicans shot it down.
[00:12:06.174 --> 00:12:07.395]  I'm not saying I'm a Republican.
[00:12:07.915 --> 00:12:20.725]  But they said the Department of Justice, Defense Homeland Security will conduct or sponsor gun research into gun safety technology to reduce accidental discharges or unauthorized use of firearms.
[00:12:21.165 --> 00:12:27.630]  Now, once again, if you want a smart gun, that's your business, but you got the DOJ pushing to get smart guns out there on the street.
[00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:34.836]  Meanwhile, if they want to do this, they should probably put smart gun technology on all the stuff they gave to El Chapo, but they don't want to talk anything about that.
[00:12:35.256 --> 00:12:49.153]  And like I said before, the Republican-controlled Congress rejected Obama's budget, likely because it contained proposals and tax code changes that represent an increase in taxes of $2.6 trillion over the next 20 years, reports CNN.
[00:12:50.154 --> 00:12:51.916]  Yeah, so we need to change some things.
[00:12:52.757 --> 00:12:58.801]  Once again, when we talk about this election cycle, I'm not exactly sure that anybody who remains on the stage is the guy for the job.
[00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:02.863]  Some people are better than others, like in any case, but I'm not 100% sold.
[00:13:03.263 --> 00:13:07.105]  And as we talked a lot about the Republicans and the Democrats, we also have libertarians.
[00:13:07.145 --> 00:13:12.788]  We have Gary Johnson, a former governor, and also John McAfee is a friend of the show and he's been on the show just today.
[00:13:12.808 --> 00:13:18.131]  It says, John McAfee, Obama administration too incompetent to implement cybersecurity.
[00:13:18.152 --> 00:13:22.114]  And this guy knows, you guys have a computer, you may have McAfee antivirus software on there.
[00:13:22.654 --> 00:13:35.003]  So you see, President Obama's $19 billion cyber security program, in which the president will appoint a cyber czar, will end in failure if implemented according to cyber security expert John McAfee.
[00:13:35.063 --> 00:13:42.009]  So, you know, people, they'll see John McAfee, they see kind of, you know, the playboy lifestyle, at least that's what he advertises, YouTube videos with all the...
[00:13:42.649 --> 00:13:44.450]  Uh, women running around and stuff like that.
[00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:47.031]  But regardless, a lot of people do that stuff behind the scenes.
[00:13:47.051 --> 00:13:54.415]  So if he wants to do it out there on YouTube, that's fine because if you guys go to the brothels, all you guys out there in D.C., they probably have some videos of you out there anyway.
[00:13:54.935 --> 00:14:00.138]  Now let's end with this talking about the social justice warrior, Paul Joseph Watson's mortal enemy.
[00:14:00.838 --> 00:14:02.720]  He does a lot of videos talking about this stuff.
[00:14:03.121 --> 00:14:08.507]  And now we see that Twitter has recruited feminists who think everything is racist to police the internet.
[00:14:08.967 --> 00:14:11.270]  And yeah, this is a great video from Watson.
[00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:21.160]  I think it's a very interesting take how all these people want to suppress people's free speech in the notion that they're being inclusive.
[00:14:21.701 --> 00:14:29.288]  You know, it's like, I support people's rights and views and lifestyles until they actually meet somebody with a different point of view or lifestyle.
[00:14:29.328 --> 00:14:31.290]  So here's that video from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:41.474]  Twitter has announced the creation of a new Trust and Safety Council that critics assert will police free speech and censor conservative voices.
[00:14:41.654 --> 00:14:45.815]  And who did they pick to oversee this new advisory board?
[00:14:45.975 --> 00:14:49.557]  Everything is sexist, everything is racist, everything is homophobic.
[00:14:49.577 --> 00:14:58.580]  That's right, it's Anita Sarkeesian, the feminist who thinks that telling social justice warriors they're liars is a form of harassment.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:04.846]  Harassment is threats of violence, but it's also the day-to-day grind of you're a liar, you suck.
[00:15:05.126 --> 00:15:06.948]  Let me emphasize that point.
[00:15:07.388 --> 00:15:17.177]  Twitter is now being advised on its free speech policy by somebody who thinks that criticism of feminism is a form of hate speech.
[00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:19.319]  But Twitter's a private company.
[00:15:19.679 --> 00:15:21.681]  It can censor whoever it likes.
[00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:22.182]  Right.
[00:15:22.742 --> 00:15:24.783]  And how's that working out for them?
[00:15:24.883 --> 00:15:37.405]  Since it tightened the screws on free speech and started suspending and banning conservatives, the company's stock has plunged and top executives are fleeing like rats from a sinking ship.
[00:15:37.565 --> 00:15:43.087]  Now Twitter's user count is set to decline for the first time ever.
[00:15:43.187 --> 00:15:43.847]  Hey Twitter!
[00:15:44.187 --> 00:15:55.302]  Turning your entire platform into one giant safe space for perpetually triggered SJW cult members is not a good business move.
[00:15:55.382 --> 00:16:00.229]  Just ask Mattel, who caved to professionally offended morons
[00:16:00.649 --> 00:16:07.316]  By creating a fat feminist Barbie, a decision that resulted in a marketing nightmare.
[00:16:07.416 --> 00:16:16.404]  On the other hand, Protein World, who gave the middle finger to funless fat pride feminists, went on to make millions in profits.
[00:16:16.565 --> 00:16:20.749]  Look at what happened to Reddit and 4chan when they cracked down on free speech.
[00:16:21.129 --> 00:16:22.730]  Didn't go so well.
[00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:28.493]  Twitter claims that its new Ministry of Truth contains a diversity of voices.
[00:16:28.693 --> 00:16:37.938]  And that claim is total bulls**t. Not a single one of the organisations listed is an unrestricted proponent of free speech.
[00:16:38.098 --> 00:16:44.062]  Groups like the Foundation for Individual Rights and the Electronic Frontier Foundation aren't involved.
[00:16:44.142 --> 00:16:46.483]  There's no diversity whatsoever.
[00:16:46.943 --> 00:16:52.849]  Most of these groups are dedicated to censorship and smearing their political adversaries.
[00:16:52.989 --> 00:16:59.736]  Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey thinks that freedom of expression starts with safety.
[00:17:00.196 --> 00:17:03.079]  A line that wouldn't look out of place in Orwell's 1984.
[00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:17.117]  And isn't it an amazing coincidence how Twitter began this censorship purge immediately after a member of the Saudi royal family became its second biggest shareholder.
[00:17:17.237 --> 00:17:26.001]  Saudi Arabia, the country that tortures and executes people who break blasphemy laws by criticizing the religion of Islam.
[00:17:26.121 --> 00:17:36.047]  Twitter also reserves the right to ban people who criticise Islam, characterising advocacy against someone's religion as hate speech.
[00:17:36.147 --> 00:17:43.292]  But it's not just Twitter that's thrown in the towel and allowed itself to be subverted by regressive authoritarians.
[00:17:43.472 --> 00:17:46.674]  Facebook is now working with the German government and ex-
[00:17:47.154 --> 00:17:50.935]  Starzy members to punish critics of mass immigration.
[00:17:51.095 --> 00:18:02.698]  One Dutch man who said on social media that he thought allowing in untold numbers of migrants was a quote bad plan later received a home visit from the police.
[00:18:02.918 --> 00:18:10.360]  Websites like the Guardian are also closing down comment sections because their leftist narratives are being demolished.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:15.581]  Hey Jack Dorsey if you want Twitter to go down the toilet then go ahead.
[00:18:16.101 --> 00:18:23.706]  Turn it into one giant circle jerk safe space for Islamists, feminists and social justice warriors.
[00:18:23.946 --> 00:18:30.050]  Slap a giant censored sticker over what made social media great in the first place.
[00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:39.336]  Vigorous debate, dissent and a true diversity of opinion will simply take our huge audiences elsewhere.
[00:18:39.496 --> 00:18:45.080]  The cultural renaissance will continue to rise with or without
[00:18:45.721 --> 00:18:46.207]  Twitter.
[00:19:10.766 --> 00:19:12.068]  We believe in win-win, folks.
[00:19:12.128 --> 00:19:13.869]  Treating people like we want to be treated.
[00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:18.634]  That's why we developed IntraCeuticals with Dr. Group and other top researchers, chemists, scientists, you name it.
[00:19:18.794 --> 00:19:19.735]  He's one of our advisors.
[00:19:20.016 --> 00:19:25.481]  To come up with products like AnthroPlex that is an original product that he made just for us.
[00:19:26.422 --> 00:19:28.384]  And this is a base
[00:19:29.298 --> 00:19:34.120]  system to make super male or super female vitality work even better.
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.180]  It is natural.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.482]  It just helps get your body pumping and going in the way you need to be going.
[00:19:40.882 --> 00:19:54.566]  And Dr. Group is here until we go to break to tell us about the latest product at Infowarslife.com, AnthroPlex, that out of the gates, and we do this all the time with the new product, we discount it out of the gates to get you to try it, knowing that you're going to love it.
[00:19:55.566 --> 00:19:56.187]  It'll sell out.
[00:19:56.527 --> 00:20:07.295]  So, Infowarslife.com, Anthroplex, 15% off and free shipping for the next two days only when you get it with Supermail or Female Vitality.
[00:20:07.435 --> 00:20:08.215]  Let's go to Dr. Group.
[00:20:08.396 --> 00:20:14.240]  Why do you call this the foundation to start the fire and then the Supermail takes you to the next level?
[00:20:15.455 --> 00:20:32.302]  Well, we just look at the base problem that's going on right now all over the world, which is the endocrine-disrupting chemicals, the amount of estrogen that men have, the femininity of men, and what's going on even in children right now with low testosterone levels.
[00:20:32.782 --> 00:20:33.443]  We're good to go!
[00:21:00.939 --> 00:21:02.800]  What is in the goat weed?
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.301]  You've got one of the purest, strongest organic forms of it.
[00:21:05.361 --> 00:21:06.922]  What's so magic about the goat weed?
[00:21:20.228 --> 00:21:33.334]  Well, the horny goat weed was given that name because years ago in India, they noticed that a certain time of the year, this weed would grow and the goats would eat it and they would just go crazy with all the female goats.
[00:21:33.394 --> 00:21:34.915]  So that's how it was developed.
[00:21:34.955 --> 00:21:35.896]  It's called epimidium.
[00:21:36.696 --> 00:21:43.400]  And what that's been proven to do over thousands of years is increase sexual pleasure, help balance the male hormones.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.181]  It can actually be used for women as well.
[00:21:45.621 --> 00:21:52.485]  But it really kind of resets and brings the hormone balance, improves sperm motility, and increases testosterone levels.
[00:21:52.505 --> 00:21:54.506]  So it counters the stuff they've been throwing at us.
[00:21:54.766 --> 00:21:55.866]  Results will vary.
[00:21:55.946 --> 00:21:58.588]  Overall, all I know is dynamite.
[00:21:59.028 --> 00:22:03.893]  I mean, absolutely dynamite with the stamina, with the weight lifting, with the swimming.
[00:22:04.133 --> 00:22:09.137]  Folks, the new product is available, AnthroPlex, available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:09.498 --> 00:22:11.640]  Dr. Group, thank you for developing this amazing product.
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:12.080]  Thank you.
[00:23:03.447 --> 00:23:11.600]  Right now we're going to go to the Vice President of the Border Patrol Association and his name is Sean Moran.
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:17.488]  He testified a year ago for Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee about the problems at the border.
[00:23:17.509 --> 00:23:17.969]  You know, we're all
[00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:25.794]  frustrated about what's going on with the open borders, and no one is more frustrated about it than the Border Patrol itself.
[00:23:25.975 --> 00:23:38.522]  They're very angry about the fact that our government is essentially telling them to stand down, to release people that are coming into our country, that are being intercepted, caught, given court dates, they're not showing up.
[00:23:38.622 --> 00:23:44.546]  So the response of the Obama administration was, well, let's just let them go, because it looks bad when people don't show up to court.
[00:23:45.126 --> 00:23:54.129]  We had an article last week from the president of the National Border Patrol Council who said we might as well abolish our immigration laws.
[00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:55.170]  And that's true.
[00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:58.231]  We might as well just do that, I guess, if we're not going to enforce that.
[00:23:58.551 --> 00:24:02.893]  But that's essentially what our president has done by executive order.
[00:24:03.473 --> 00:24:05.755]  He has essentially abolished our immigration laws.
[00:24:06.116 --> 00:24:08.338]  So we're going to talk to Sean Moran again.
[00:24:08.738 --> 00:24:12.202]  He is the Vice President of the National Border Patrol Council.
[00:24:12.282 --> 00:24:15.665]  You can find him at bpunion.org.
[00:24:15.745 --> 00:24:20.690]  You can get information about the council that he's part of.
[00:24:20.991 --> 00:24:22.452]  And they represent Border Patrol
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:39.172]  Officers who are the front line on the border and they are very very concerned about what they see happening very frustrated about this actually they represent 18,000 Border Patrol agents and support personnel assigned to the US border.
[00:24:39.192 --> 00:24:40.974]  So joining us now is Sean Moran.
[00:24:41.354 --> 00:24:43.175]  Thank you for speaking to us.
[00:24:43.195 --> 00:24:43.676]  Mr. Moran.
[00:24:44.697 --> 00:24:45.377]  Oh, thanks for having me.
[00:24:45.397 --> 00:24:46.358]  It's good to be back on the show
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:50.582]  Now, we've got a lot of people concerned about what's going on.
[00:24:50.642 --> 00:24:51.703]  We see what's happening.
[00:24:51.783 --> 00:25:01.409]  I was just in the Big Bend region with my wife last week, and of course, as we were there, we got the Rio Grande, a very narrow, shallow river.
[00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:09.874]  As we were walking around a canyon there, went around a corner, there was a guy who was serenading us on the other side, a Mexican guy.
[00:25:09.914 --> 00:25:11.555]  He had a tip jar on the American side.
[00:25:11.576 --> 00:25:14.958]  They're going back and forth very easily with that, and yet,
[00:25:15.798 --> 00:25:18.120]  There was no presence in terms of Border Patrol there.
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:25.326]  As we left the park, about 40 miles north of the park, there was a permanent station set up on one of the roads going north.
[00:25:25.427 --> 00:25:29.130]  And they were just asking people, are you an American citizen?
[00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:30.311]  And we'd say, yeah.
[00:25:30.631 --> 00:25:31.372]  They'd say, well, go ahead.
[00:25:32.032 --> 00:25:34.114]  What does that accomplish?
[00:25:34.414 --> 00:25:36.156]  Are you frustrated by that kind of approach?
[00:25:37.492 --> 00:25:52.764]  Well, we are because that is part of our defense in depth, but we've forgotten about certain parts of the strategy under Operation Gatekeeper, Operation Hold the Line in El Paso that all started in the mid to late 90s.
[00:25:53.925 --> 00:25:58.570]  You're supposed to have agents at the border stopping people from coming in apprehending the ones that are there.
[00:25:58.991 --> 00:26:09.182]  You have those permanent checkpoints that you referenced, and those are set up so that we can interdict people and drugs on the way to major cities in the US.
[00:26:09.562 --> 00:26:11.585]  And then we're supposed to have interior patrol.
[00:26:12.225 --> 00:26:16.030]  Unfortunately, you don't have Border Patrol agents going out there doing that.
[00:26:16.191 --> 00:26:25.904]  It's been delegated away to ICE, and ICE seems more interested in doing other types of activity that don't really relate to immigration enforcement.
[00:26:26.377 --> 00:26:30.978]  Yeah, there's another one that we encountered close to Corpus Christi.
[00:26:31.018 --> 00:26:34.159]  There's a couple of different roads that we can go south from Austin to Corpus Christi.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:42.402]  And as we go down, one route down, there's no permanent station, and another route that's coming up, there is a permanent station.
[00:26:42.422 --> 00:26:47.943]  So I would assume that the drug cartels know where these permanent locations are.
[00:26:48.003 --> 00:26:49.444]  I wouldn't think that would be very effective.
[00:26:51.124 --> 00:27:03.275]  Yeah, obviously the permanent ones are well known and we try to set up what are called tactical checkpoints where we give little notice and we put them up so that we can hopefully interdict people.
[00:27:04.211 --> 00:27:14.913]  We've found that the temporary checkpoints are far more effective than permanent checkpoints on every road because they will just find a way around them.
[00:27:15.613 --> 00:27:20.254]  So the effectiveness is definitely cut down if they're open all the time.
[00:27:20.754 --> 00:27:27.996]  If you can randomize it and use them to help apprehend and interdict drugs and people, then they're far more effective.
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:44.024]  It just, from our perspective, I mean, it just seems like there are these stations that are set up that don't really do anything except harass American citizens and yet there's no presence at the actual border itself, from our perspective.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:51.021]  Well, it's two different things, because you have stations that are checkpoint stations.
[00:27:51.061 --> 00:27:52.122]  That's all they do.
[00:27:52.882 --> 00:27:56.723]  But then you also have stations that work the border itself.
[00:27:57.723 --> 00:28:01.384]  I think both types of stations are undermanned.
[00:28:02.185 --> 00:28:12.808]  And at any one time, you could have, depending on how many linear miles of border you have, it could be quite a bit of territory that you have to cover.
[00:28:12.888 --> 00:28:13.588]  So you can't
[00:28:14.128 --> 00:28:19.474]  You know, you can't see a Border Patrol agent linking arms from Brownsville to San Diego.
[00:28:19.595 --> 00:28:20.115]  Right, right.
[00:28:20.275 --> 00:28:22.017]  I'm not sure that could ever happen.
[00:28:22.318 --> 00:28:25.041]  Well, you know, there's a lot of frustration with the public.
[00:28:25.101 --> 00:28:31.609]  I mean, looking at the response from the exit polls and the election that we saw yesterday in New Hampshire,
[00:28:32.429 --> 00:28:36.412]  Uh, it was a big issue in New Hampshire, and New Hampshire is a long way from the border.
[00:28:36.872 --> 00:28:47.859]  But you had 63% of Republican New Hampshire voters said a candidate would need to agree with them on immigration, and what they said was 86% of them said illegal immigrants had broken the law, should be penalized.
[00:28:47.879 --> 00:28:51.301]  83% said illegal immigrants harm national security.
[00:28:52.002 --> 00:28:56.247]  More than 75% said that illegal immigrants were driving down wages.
[00:28:56.328 --> 00:29:06.241]  So even in a northern state like New Hampshire, as far away from the border, because most of this is happening with the southern border, they're very concerned about it.
[00:29:06.281 --> 00:29:08.645]  They feel that it is something that
[00:29:09.565 --> 00:29:15.770]  When they talk about harming national security, they're concerned that terrorist organizations are going to come in, drug gangs are going to come in.
[00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:18.512]  They feel that it's driving down wages.
[00:29:18.712 --> 00:29:20.873]  So there's frustration that nothing is being done.
[00:29:20.913 --> 00:29:30.920]  But I understand you're frustrated as well because you've got an administration that has decided that they're essentially going to abolish the immigration laws by executive order.
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:35.223]  And that's what the president of the National Border Patrol Council, Brandon Judd,
[00:29:35.603 --> 00:29:39.767]  He said last week, he said we might as well abolish our immigration laws altogether.
[00:29:39.787 --> 00:29:46.634]  You got a policy where they are telling you that you have to release people because they're not showing up to court.
[00:29:46.674 --> 00:29:48.456]  Just let them go and do not track them.
[00:29:48.516 --> 00:29:49.257]  Talk to us about that.
[00:29:50.908 --> 00:30:03.336]  Well, first, let me say I believe immigration affects every community in this country, and I think that's why we see such importance in the current presidential elections and in places like New Hampshire.
[00:30:04.137 --> 00:30:05.738]  New Hampshire knows about the borders.
[00:30:05.978 --> 00:30:07.819]  They have, I believe it's
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.522]  Over 100 miles of border with Canada.
[00:30:11.982 --> 00:30:13.263]  So they know what it's like.
[00:30:13.303 --> 00:30:23.170]  They know the threat is real, that people can slip across the Canadian border just as easily, probably easier than they can with the U.S.-Mexico border.
[00:30:23.959 --> 00:30:39.474]  But the Obama administration, getting back to that, they have enacted executive actions and policies that have gutted our immigration enforcement and it runs counter to what the American people want, I think, over the past 10 years.
[00:30:40.695 --> 00:31:03.141]  We have seen an increase in awareness of the border, support for Border Patrol agents, support for immigration enforcement, and that's just not happening because we are carving out whole sections of the law and throwing them away so that Border Patrol agents are effectively handcuffed and unable to do their job as they're supposed to do.
[00:31:04.013 --> 00:31:21.082]  One of the things that they're doing now in this new policy from Obama is you're looking at people and say that, well, as long as they don't have a previous felony arrest conviction, as long as they claim to have been continuously in the United States since January of 2014, you have to release them.
[00:31:21.122 --> 00:31:25.144]  And of course, the point is they can just claim that they've been here.
[00:31:25.184 --> 00:31:27.326]  They don't have to prove that in any way.
[00:31:28.146 --> 00:31:29.547]  That's absolutely amazing.
[00:31:29.667 --> 00:31:33.529]  That really is just shutting down the border, the immigration laws.
[00:31:35.262 --> 00:31:36.503]  Yeah, I would agree with you.
[00:31:36.523 --> 00:31:38.824]  I think it's irresponsible.
[00:31:39.824 --> 00:31:57.913]  Anytime we have any type of curtailment of enforcement, or we have a new policy that might restrict something we can do, previous to our current, I'll use this as an example, our current pursuit policy, when we have criminals that are trying to abscond in a vehicle,
[00:31:58.513 --> 00:31:58.833]  All right.
[00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:13.910]  I think so.
[00:32:35.259 --> 00:32:36.982]  And that's our responsibility to deal with.
[00:32:37.042 --> 00:32:48.278]  So it shouldn't be agencies like the Texas Rangers or Arizona DPS or California Highway Patrol that have to deal with criminals like this that are fleeing through their towns.
[00:33:14.893 --> 00:33:17.355]  This is Bernie Sanders and I'm quite upset.
[00:33:17.555 --> 00:33:24.298]  If you guys saw the Iowa Caucus the other night, you would know that I worked extremely hard for these votes.
[00:33:24.598 --> 00:33:30.761]  And the people that were working in the Iowa Caucus took what I worked hard for and gave it to someone else.
[00:33:31.081 --> 00:33:36.063]  A lying, cheating, horrible human being by the name of Hillary Clinton.
[00:33:38.244 --> 00:33:42.146]  I don't understand how anybody could like something like this.
[00:33:42.226 --> 00:33:54.492]  That you work hard for something your whole life and you earn something and then you're expected to give it to someone else who's not as deserving and is too lazy or more of a piece of crap than you are.
[00:33:54.632 --> 00:33:57.613]  What kind of person would even think about something like that?
[00:33:57.873 --> 00:34:01.235]  Hey, that'd be you, Bernie Sanders.
[00:34:01.475 --> 00:34:02.536]  Guess you just felt the Bern.
[00:34:03.656 --> 00:34:06.657]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:06.858 --> 00:34:07.478]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:14.301]  The knowledge of the ancients.
[00:34:14.641 --> 00:34:18.184]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[00:34:18.444 --> 00:34:21.067]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[00:34:21.387 --> 00:34:24.830]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:28.734]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts.
[00:34:28.854 --> 00:34:29.174]  I'm good.
[00:34:53.069 --> 00:34:54.110]  We're good to go.
[00:35:12.617 --> 00:35:18.719]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:35:18.759 --> 00:35:20.020]  The police are shoving people.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.041]  Shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:35:22.061 --> 00:35:23.801]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted.
[00:35:23.841 --> 00:35:30.104]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:35:30.204 --> 00:35:36.106]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:35:36.246 --> 00:35:40.028]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:35:40.208 --> 00:35:43.169]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:35:43.289 --> 00:35:51.292]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:35:51.573 --> 00:35:53.613]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:35:53.673 --> 00:35:54.714]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:35:55.054 --> 00:36:03.822]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[00:36:46.168 --> 00:36:51.029]  I don't know.
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:12.444]  Yeah.
[00:37:21.357 --> 00:37:24.018]  Sir, just so you know, not to bug you, but I think it's something I have to do because they're leaving the borders open.
[00:37:24.038 --> 00:37:24.859]  The Border Patrol is no longer a border.
[00:37:24.879 --> 00:37:25.339]  I'm not against the TSA.
[00:37:25.359 --> 00:37:27.160]  I was pointing out this is all for Americans, not for the security of the country.
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:29.101]  So I'm going to do a lot to help people, so I just let you know I'm doing that.
[00:37:29.121 --> 00:37:29.541]  That's perfect.
[00:37:29.561 --> 00:37:30.221]  Great, thanks so much.
[00:37:30.241 --> 00:37:31.802]  You're going to be good with all your property on the other side?
[00:37:31.842 --> 00:37:32.122]  Absolutely.
[00:37:32.142 --> 00:37:34.323]  I'm just, the only thing I do is to educate people, so I just wanted to tell you, you know, I'm very grateful.
[00:37:49.042 --> 00:37:51.944]  Here I am, taking my wallet out, my shoes off, I'm a prisoner.
[00:37:52.024 --> 00:37:53.205]  All about humiliation.
[00:37:53.245 --> 00:37:54.967]  Shoes off, gloves off, adults off.
[00:37:54.987 --> 00:37:57.028]  Going into prison.
[00:37:57.068 --> 00:37:59.190]  Going into America.
[00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:03.253]  Got anything else in your pockets, sir?
[00:38:03.353 --> 00:38:03.954]  Nope.
[00:38:03.994 --> 00:38:05.495]  Paper, money, nothing?
[00:38:05.615 --> 00:38:06.215]  No, sir.
[00:38:13.404 --> 00:38:14.385]  That's mine, yeah.
[00:38:14.445 --> 00:38:16.106]  I've never been to prison.
[00:38:16.166 --> 00:38:17.648]  This is my prisoner training.
[00:38:17.708 --> 00:38:18.628]  Yes, this is my bag.
[00:38:18.689 --> 00:38:19.189]  Anything else?
[00:38:19.209 --> 00:38:19.469]  Nothing.
[00:38:19.489 --> 00:38:19.970]  Just the two?
[00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.650]  I've been through a lot.
[00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:21.671]  I'm just having that poop.
[00:38:21.691 --> 00:38:22.172]  Great, thank you.
[00:38:37.927 --> 00:38:38.267]  How you doing, man?
[00:38:38.287 --> 00:38:38.548]  I'm all right.
[00:38:38.568 --> 00:38:38.888]  How you doing?
[00:38:38.908 --> 00:38:40.389]  Now, I know there's actually a real issue with airports and security.
[00:38:40.409 --> 00:38:41.030]  My issue is, I'm a newscaster.
[00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:41.370]  I read the news.
[00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:42.651]  Now they don't even check passports flying into major airports.
[00:38:42.671 --> 00:38:43.612]  They just let folks through without permission.
[00:38:43.632 --> 00:38:44.092]  Unless they're citizens.
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:39:01.623]  150 passengers arriving from Cancun, Mexico were allowed to leave the airport without going through customs, the Daily News has learned.
[00:39:02.224 --> 00:39:12.528]  When the plane landed, airline and security officials at Kennedy Airport let passengers walk out of the airport without having their passports or bags checked by Customs and Border Protection.
[00:39:12.948 --> 00:39:16.389]  The amazing event is at the border when actually people aren't supposed to be there.
[00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:20.851]  They're dissolving at the Border Patrol house.
[00:39:22.551 --> 00:39:23.291]  Yeah, I'm sure.
[00:39:23.331 --> 00:39:25.492]  That's why I'm trying to educate you guys.
[00:39:25.592 --> 00:39:26.032]  It's crazy.
[00:39:26.072 --> 00:39:36.536]  I'm not blaming you, but I just kind of think it's discriminatory that citizens have to go through this, but the actual boarders, when there's a constitutional authorization to search people, you know, that's wide open.
[00:39:36.596 --> 00:39:37.517]  How you doing?
[00:39:37.537 --> 00:39:40.198]  You're at the boarder patrol.
[00:39:40.318 --> 00:39:41.598]  How many people on board?
[00:39:41.638 --> 00:39:41.758]  Me?
[00:39:41.838 --> 00:39:43.059]  You're a citizen.
[00:39:43.119 --> 00:39:45.240]  Yeah, but does it really matter?
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.421]  Not anymore, unfortunately.
[00:39:50.057 --> 00:39:57.202]  Tennessee is now the first state ever to work with the TSA to deploy a simultaneous counter-terrorism operation statewide.
[00:39:57.402 --> 00:40:10.791]  You're probably used to seeing these signature blue uniforms at the airport, but now TSA agents are on the interstates fighting terrorism with visible intermodal prevention and response, or VIPER, operations.
[00:40:11.932 --> 00:40:15.434]  I just see this as a process to condition the American people to internal checkpoints.
[00:40:18.891 --> 00:40:25.837]  Well, yeah, I watched C-SPAN 15 years ago and established VHS, and they actually admitted all that, so I have no reason to do it.
[00:40:25.857 --> 00:40:32.243]  No, I just do this every time, because I'm the whole guy that did the whole TSA opt-out thing to begin with, Alex Jones and fullworks.com.
[00:40:32.603 --> 00:40:33.904]  I don't blame you guys individually.
[00:40:33.924 --> 00:40:35.566]  My whole issue is...
[00:40:41.905 --> 00:40:42.746]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:40:43.166 --> 00:40:49.769]  But I understood as you point out that they actually fly into the country and just let folks in and don't even check their IDs.
[00:40:49.889 --> 00:40:50.690]  And that's deliberate.
[00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:53.591]  As the War Patrol said, they complete the smuggling process.
[00:40:53.991 --> 00:40:57.093]  The government wants to open the borders up.
[00:40:58.183 --> 00:40:59.904]  Why don't we do it as a citizen?
[00:40:59.964 --> 00:41:05.027]  I get there could be jihadis trying to come through, but at least we'll have plenty of a day.
[00:41:05.087 --> 00:41:05.468]  I get it.
[00:41:05.508 --> 00:41:06.849]  But, well then what's the point?
[00:41:06.889 --> 00:41:09.470]  The borders are open, but then internally we do it.
[00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:12.192]  You know, we can bring somebody in here and do it.
[00:41:12.212 --> 00:41:12.532]  Absolutely.
[00:41:12.572 --> 00:41:13.433]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:41:13.453 --> 00:41:14.173]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:41:14.193 --> 00:41:15.854]  So, have a good one, man.
[00:41:15.914 --> 00:41:18.456]  Have a good weekend.
[00:41:18.716 --> 00:41:19.697]  Check out InfoWars.com.
[00:41:19.777 --> 00:41:20.197]  InfoWars?
[00:41:20.217 --> 00:41:20.477]  Absolutely.
[00:41:20.637 --> 00:41:21.458]  InfoWars.com.
[00:41:21.478 --> 00:41:22.979]  Is that like a random fax?
[00:41:23.139 --> 00:41:25.060]  It's about, the site's about $10 million a month.
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:25.260]  Wow.
[00:41:27.046 --> 00:41:29.527]  It's one of the biggest news sites in the world.
[00:41:29.607 --> 00:41:30.768]  Is that your site?
[00:41:30.848 --> 00:41:30.968]  Yup.
[00:41:31.008 --> 00:41:32.648]  Like, you're the founder?
[00:41:33.289 --> 00:41:34.429]  Yeah.
[00:41:34.449 --> 00:41:35.229]  It's like Libertarians.
[00:41:35.249 --> 00:41:36.490]  It's not Republican or Democrat.
[00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:38.011]  It's freedom-based stuff.
[00:41:38.791 --> 00:41:39.331]  That's good.
[00:41:39.731 --> 00:41:40.272]  What is it?
[00:41:40.352 --> 00:41:40.672]  InfoWars?
[00:41:41.092 --> 00:41:41.752]  InfoWars.com, yup.
[00:41:41.792 --> 00:41:52.377]  You gotta just check out the site and see all the different... I mean, mainly we take a lot of mainstream news and government reports and bills and stuff and we just...
[00:41:54.068 --> 00:42:02.716]  And that folks is how you educate frontline enforcers.
[00:42:02.776 --> 00:42:04.197]  They're just as big of slaves as we are.
[00:42:04.217 --> 00:42:05.519]  They're compartmentalized.
[00:42:05.539 --> 00:42:07.160]  I used to get mad at them individually.
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:07.481]  No.
[00:42:07.621 --> 00:42:09.823]  I was nice to them and they were all extremely receptive.
[00:42:10.724 --> 00:42:13.627]  And they actually agreed with me about why the borders are wide open and they're searching us.
[00:42:15.888 --> 00:42:18.109]  All of you, when you educate your fellow humans, are the resistance.
[00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:19.811]  And resistance is victory.
[00:42:20.531 --> 00:42:22.452]  So why is the Border Patrol bringing them here?
[00:42:22.852 --> 00:42:26.095]  They're not bringing them here, they're bringing them to our bus terminal.
[00:42:26.115 --> 00:42:31.778]  Because that's where the Border Patrol understands that they have transportation to go to the interior.
[00:42:32.258 --> 00:42:32.439]  Right.
[00:42:32.579 --> 00:42:33.519]  So they're dropping them off.
[00:42:33.599 --> 00:42:37.722]  It's our understanding that they were dropped off with tickets, or with vouchers for tickets.
[00:42:39.744 --> 00:42:47.829]  Turns out some of them didn't tonight, didn't have their ticket, or didn't have their voucher, or like I said, their bus isn't till tomorrow, so they got nowhere to stay.
[00:42:48.249 --> 00:42:55.453]  Our bus terminal, by ours, I mean the city of McAllen, I mean the bus terminal is not a 24-7 operation, so we've got to put them up somewhere else.
[00:42:55.493 --> 00:43:08.681]  So for tonight, we're doing the best we can with this resource, which thankfully one of our neighboring cities made available to us, and we're going to put them up here tonight, tomorrow we'll have a little chat with the Border Patrol and see what's going on.
[00:43:11.966 --> 00:43:15.950]  American jobs are increasingly rotting from the inside out.
[00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:21.916]  MarketWatch reports there are now more than 260,000 robots working in U.S.
[00:43:21.996 --> 00:43:22.556]  factories.
[00:43:22.737 --> 00:43:26.380]  Orders and shipments for robots in North America set new records in 2015.
[00:43:27.521 --> 00:43:40.951]  According to Industry Trade Group Robotic Industries Association, a total of 31,464 robots valued at a combined $1.8 billion were ordered from the North American companies last year.
[00:43:41.192 --> 00:43:49.258]  The most popular jobs for these robots were industrial, including coating and dispensing, material handling, and spot welding.
[00:43:49.838 --> 00:44:05.860]  Blindsided by technological gains and a sick fascination with artificial intelligence, the leftist media spews out reports glorifying an unstoppable race towards the demise of the one thing that has kept America humming along as a global innovator for close to 240 years.
[00:44:07.722 --> 00:44:08.563]  Skilled Labor.
[00:44:08.883 --> 00:44:12.866]  The numbers of apprenticing electricians, welders, machinists, etc.
[00:44:12.986 --> 00:44:15.207]  have been dwindling in the past 10 years.
[00:44:15.367 --> 00:44:19.550]  Forbes reported in 2012, 53% of skilled trade workers in the US were 45 years and older, and 18.6% were between the ages of 55 and 64.
[00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:20.471]  The Tampa Tribune reports
[00:44:28.516 --> 00:44:41.585]  Ken Simonson, Chief Economist at Associated General Contractors of America said, the industry is hiring people at quite a strong clip, but at the same time, contractors are saying that they can't find the folks with the skills they want.
[00:44:41.805 --> 00:44:49.170]  They're having to pull in people from other industries or people that haven't done it before, which isn't always something you can make do with.
[00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:57.653]  It's blatantly obvious that a combination of fundamental factors are leading to a third world future for the United States of America.
[00:44:57.993 --> 00:45:02.274]  The millennial generation is simply not interested in a vocational education.
[00:45:02.494 --> 00:45:08.436]  Projects will simply not be built in the future or may take much longer as skilled labor is sparse.
[00:45:08.837 --> 00:45:12.818]  Also, the unchecked and unethical destruction of American working families
[00:45:13.138 --> 00:45:22.264]  As American companies like Disney have American workers train foreign workers on temporary H-1B visas to replace them.
[00:45:22.844 --> 00:45:29.188]  The New York Times reported about 250 Disney employees were told in late October that they would be laid off.
[00:45:29.568 --> 00:45:38.173]  Many of their jobs were transferred to immigrants on temporary visas for highly skilled technical workers, who were brought in by an outsourcing firm based in India.
[00:45:38.453 --> 00:45:45.498]  Over the next three months, some Disney employees were required to train their replacements to do the jobs they had lost.
[00:45:46.198 --> 00:45:54.480]  One former worker said, I just couldn't believe they could fly people in to sit at our desks and take over our jobs exactly.
[00:45:54.820 --> 00:46:00.582]  It was so humiliating to train somebody else to take over your job, I still can't grasp it.
[00:46:01.022 --> 00:46:14.645]  Of course, NAFTA, GATT, KORUS, and the impending sovereign-destroying Trans-Pacific Partnership will and have destroyed millions of American jobs and led cities like Detroit, for example, to ruin in their wake.
[00:46:15.225 --> 00:46:16.686]  The robots aren't coming.
[00:46:17.266 --> 00:46:18.687]  The robots are here.
[00:46:18.867 --> 00:46:32.834]  And it won't be long before automation completely wipes out everything from cashiers to call center operators, taxi drivers, real estate agents, accountants, journalists, internet comment section trolls, etc.
[00:46:32.955 --> 00:46:33.475]  etc.
[00:46:33.855 --> 00:46:37.277]  It's abundantly clear the New World Order global governance
[00:46:37.737 --> 00:46:49.604]  That is established itself while we were on holiday or working our third job is on the verge of wiping out the middle class and converting the remaining populace into a peasant class.
[00:46:49.824 --> 00:46:56.328]  We have all been subjected to a soft, slow war guaranteeing our demise for decades.
[00:46:56.788 --> 00:46:58.850]  Of course, you were never told.
[00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:00.831]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:47:03.007 --> 00:47:04.009]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:06.833]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.114 --> 00:47:14.966]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.468]  We're good.
[00:49:10.293 --> 00:49:12.454]  Leanne McAdoo for InfoWars.com.
[00:49:12.534 --> 00:49:17.337]  Out here in Austin, Texas, trying to find out if people know who was the real winner of the Democratic primaries last night.
[00:49:17.637 --> 00:49:24.221]  Bernie Sanders supporters are super pumped because he seemed to have a sweeping upset there for Hillary Clinton with more than 60% of the votes.
[00:49:24.541 --> 00:49:28.003]  But it turns out for Clinton, even when she loses, she wins.
[00:49:28.343 --> 00:49:31.185]  She's going to get two more delegates than Bernie Sanders.
[00:49:31.585 --> 00:49:38.349]  Either way, whatever way this plays out, Sanders, his voters are going to be really smiling now, but crying later.
[00:49:39.636 --> 00:49:40.276]  Hey there!
[00:49:40.516 --> 00:49:41.737]  Hey, what's up?
[00:49:41.757 --> 00:49:44.098]  So who do you think won the Democratic primary last night?
[00:49:44.518 --> 00:49:45.198]  Uh, Bernie Sanders.
[00:49:46.018 --> 00:49:46.958]  Bernie Sanders, absolutely.
[00:49:47.259 --> 00:49:47.479]  Right.
[00:49:47.619 --> 00:49:47.859]  Yeah.
[00:49:48.159 --> 00:49:52.040]  But, Hillary Clinton, even though she loses, she wins.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:53.621]  She got more delegates than him.
[00:49:56.902 --> 00:49:57.562]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:49:57.782 --> 00:50:00.443]  I actually... Yeah, most people don't... Yeah, no, I didn't know that.
[00:50:01.223 --> 00:50:01.503]  What?
[00:50:01.543 --> 00:50:02.344]  Bernie Sanders?
[00:50:03.524 --> 00:50:04.945]  With 60% of the vote, right?
[00:50:06.025 --> 00:50:06.205]  Yeah.
[00:50:06.886 --> 00:50:09.587]  Well, how did Hillary get more delegates than him?
[00:50:10.467 --> 00:50:10.807]  I don't know.
[00:50:10.847 --> 00:50:11.548]  How does that work?
[00:50:11.988 --> 00:50:12.428]  Not sure.
[00:50:12.448 --> 00:50:15.869]  Yeah, does it appear as if the system is rigged?
[00:50:16.089 --> 00:50:18.970]  Or, I mean, can the establishment ever be taken down?
[00:50:22.452 --> 00:50:23.012]  Probably not.
[00:50:23.572 --> 00:50:26.173]  This system seems like it's just flawed.
[00:50:27.126 --> 00:50:31.469]  Yeah, she went into the game with the bases loaded with six superdelegates.
[00:50:32.129 --> 00:50:40.075]  So do you think that Bernie Sanders supporters, should they continue with this fight, this revolution that's going on, or do you think that there is no chance?
[00:50:41.956 --> 00:50:42.796]  I mean, look at that.
[00:50:42.976 --> 00:50:43.617]  There's no chance.
[00:50:44.237 --> 00:50:46.639]  She's just going to get the delegates no matter what.
[00:50:47.264 --> 00:50:54.669]  What do you think about the fact that even though Bernie Sanders technically won, he lost to Hillary Clinton based on the establishment choosing the delegates?
[00:50:55.009 --> 00:50:55.710]  I'm not surprised.
[00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:57.451]  Clinton's backed by all the big banks, man.
[00:50:57.491 --> 00:51:02.294]  Goldman Sachs, all the big guys are backing Clinton, so she's definitely got a lot of money behind it.
[00:51:02.314 --> 00:51:10.740]  And even though Sanders does have a lot of support, apparently a lot of support, especially from college students, his policies aren't exactly the best, you know?
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:15.523]  Very socialistic, and I don't think they're exactly the best for America.
[00:51:15.623 --> 00:51:16.844]  Like I said, I don't like either one of them.
[00:51:17.404 --> 00:51:22.066]  I mean, I think the establishment would be more likely to support a candidate like Hillary Clinton.
[00:51:22.566 --> 00:51:22.726]  Right.
[00:51:23.126 --> 00:51:23.286]  Yeah.
[00:51:23.446 --> 00:51:31.389]  So does it appear as though the game might be rigged in her favor when the people clearly are wanting Sanders, but... But somehow she's ending up with more delegates?
[00:51:31.429 --> 00:51:31.629]  I do.
[00:51:31.649 --> 00:51:34.290]  I do think that's indicative of like a flaw in the establishment.
[00:51:34.310 --> 00:51:34.630]  Yeah.
[00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:42.933]  And I think, too, with this whole delegate system, it sort of says to these Bernie Sanders voters, you guys should just quit while you're ahead, you know, because it's not, it doesn't matter.
[00:51:43.473 --> 00:51:44.694]  She's still going to get the delegates.
[00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:46.671]  I think that's what that says.
[00:51:46.991 --> 00:51:56.920]  Based on most of the Bernie supporters I've met though, they're a pretty committed bunch to him and his movement and his so-called political revolution.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:03.846]  So I don't think that this is going to be enough to deter Bernie supporters entirely.
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:05.660]  Who are you going for?
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:06.561]  Who do you want to see in there?
[00:52:06.701 --> 00:52:07.961]  I'm not going to vote by party line.
[00:52:08.001 --> 00:52:11.002]  I'm going to vote by who represents what I want in a president.
[00:52:11.382 --> 00:52:16.404]  And I don't agree with all of the ideals of the current candidates.
[00:52:17.545 --> 00:52:17.825]  I know.
[00:52:18.065 --> 00:52:19.845]  Rand Paul was mine, but he dropped out, so.
[00:52:19.946 --> 00:52:20.806]  Yes, Rand Paul.
[00:52:21.266 --> 00:52:22.767]  We need him to stay in the Senate, though, so.
[00:52:22.927 --> 00:52:23.127]  Yes.
[00:52:23.667 --> 00:52:25.728]  Unfortunately, or go for the Supreme Court!
[00:52:25.948 --> 00:52:26.868]  Did you hear that, Trump?
[00:52:27.408 --> 00:52:31.810]  His ideas did influence a lot of the Republicans, with the support that he got in Iowa, at least.
[00:52:32.944 --> 00:52:37.226]  So do you think you'll just write in somebody random like I normally do every year?
[00:52:38.347 --> 00:52:45.230]  We'll see who's still on the ballot come Super Tuesday in the Texas primaries and I'll see who I'm leading then.
[00:52:45.791 --> 00:52:48.392]  Then Hillary Clinton, even though she loses, she still wins.
[00:52:49.353 --> 00:52:50.994]  What do you think that says about the establishment?
[00:52:52.634 --> 00:52:55.236]  I'm going to decline to comment on the establishment.
[00:52:55.316 --> 00:52:55.636]  Thank you.
[00:52:55.896 --> 00:52:57.217]  So you think Bernie Sanders won?
[00:52:58.161 --> 00:53:00.843]  Um, I think he showed that he's a serious contender.
[00:53:01.243 --> 00:53:01.763]  Oh.
[00:53:01.823 --> 00:53:09.948]  It'll be, it's not November yet, it's a little early to be making that call, but I think that if he keeps playing off of this vibe, he will definitely win the nomination.
[00:53:10.608 --> 00:53:14.210]  Well, he got more than 60% of the vote last night, right?
[00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.310]  Yeah.
[00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:19.693]  But even when she loses, she wins, because Clinton actually got more delegates.
[00:53:20.533 --> 00:53:21.634]  Do you, how does that work?
[00:53:22.414 --> 00:53:24.996]  Oh, that's easy, that's being in the back of someone's pocket.
[00:53:27.318 --> 00:53:39.787]  So what do you think this says about, you know, Bernie Sanders, he's coming out with this like huge revolution, it's finally time to maybe we're witnessing the fall of the establishment, and then they come in and give her some superdelegates so she beats him out.
[00:53:40.568 --> 00:53:41.829]  Politics are always nasty.
[00:53:41.869 --> 00:53:44.311]  Anything that can't be explained in numbers is usually happening under the table.
[00:53:49.641 --> 00:53:50.181]  Good to see you.
[00:53:51.122 --> 00:53:51.582]  Governor Bush!
[00:53:51.702 --> 00:53:52.103]  How we doing?
[00:53:52.123 --> 00:53:52.603]  Good to see you, man.
[00:53:52.623 --> 00:53:53.123]  Good, how you doing?
[00:53:53.864 --> 00:53:58.408]  I was wondering, would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted from the 9-11 Commission report?
[00:53:58.428 --> 00:53:58.648]  Yes, sir.
[00:53:58.668 --> 00:53:59.929]  Would you be willing to see those released?
[00:53:59.949 --> 00:54:01.470]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:01.830]  You got them?
[00:54:02.991 --> 00:54:03.592]  Andrew, you may have them.
[00:54:03.632 --> 00:54:04.312]  Hopefully we can get them.
[00:54:04.552 --> 00:54:04.993]  Thank you.
[00:54:05.433 --> 00:54:09.456]  Would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted from the 9-11 Commission report?
[00:54:09.496 --> 00:54:09.697]  Yes, sir.
[00:54:09.717 --> 00:54:10.978]  Would you be willing to see those released?
[00:54:11.758 --> 00:54:12.559]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[00:54:12.619 --> 00:54:13.620]  You got them?
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:14.641]  Well, we may have them.
[00:54:14.681 --> 00:54:15.361]  Hopefully we can get them.
[00:54:15.581 --> 00:54:15.862]  Thank you.
[00:54:16.142 --> 00:54:20.065]  For the few who have seen them, they're known as the 28 pages.
[00:54:20.445 --> 00:54:26.851]  In those pages are names of people who allegedly helped the Al-Qaeda killers, but who have never been held accountable.
[00:54:27.171 --> 00:54:34.437]  Potential sources of foreign support for the September 11th hijackers, classified by the Bush administration.
[00:54:34.537 --> 00:54:39.001]  Why the 28 pages remain hidden from the public remains a mystery.
[00:54:39.161 --> 00:54:44.742]  We know the 28 pages from Senator Graham and Senator Jones that have seen it, and military we've had on that have seen it.
[00:54:44.982 --> 00:54:47.843]  It says Saudi Arabia ran the attacks to blame Iraq.
[00:54:47.883 --> 00:54:48.803]  That was always the plan.
[00:54:49.384 --> 00:54:51.284]  And then our own government, bare minimum, stood down.
[00:54:51.404 --> 00:54:52.584]  And of course it was more than that.
[00:54:53.004 --> 00:54:56.985]  But we have the fact that it now, to a great extent, was an inside job.
[00:54:57.245 --> 00:55:01.987]  I have read the 28 pages, and the 28 pages have nothing to do with national security.
[00:55:02.247 --> 00:55:02.567]  Nothing.
[00:55:02.747 --> 00:55:03.707]  I wouldn't be standing here.
[00:55:04.247 --> 00:55:06.848]  It's all about relationships and involvement in 9-11.
[00:55:07.728 --> 00:55:10.095]  I want those documents declassified.
[00:55:10.195 --> 00:55:13.985]  I'm embarrassed to be associated with a work product.
[00:55:15.029 --> 00:55:15.770]  That is secret.
[00:55:16.090 --> 00:55:27.057]  I am convinced that there was a direct line between at least some of the terrorists who carried out the September 11th attacks and the government of Saudi Arabia.
[00:55:27.437 --> 00:55:29.319]  He called it a smoking gun.
[00:55:29.719 --> 00:55:36.183]  And he went on to say the reason for this cover-up goes right up to the White House.
[00:55:36.523 --> 00:55:38.144]  This is sort of shocking when you read it.
[00:55:38.305 --> 00:55:40.326]  As I read it, we all had our own experience.
[00:55:40.953 --> 00:55:52.106]  I had to stop every couple pages and just sort of absorb and try to rearrange my understanding of history for the past 13 years and the years leading up to that.
[00:55:52.726 --> 00:55:55.469]  It challenges you to rethink everything.
[00:55:56.092 --> 00:56:00.293]  What do we know is in the 28 censored pages of the 9-11 report?
[00:56:00.613 --> 00:56:02.994]  People that have seen it said it would bring down the whole system.
[00:56:03.334 --> 00:56:06.915]  I've met with and talked to multiple members of Congress who read it.
[00:56:06.955 --> 00:56:09.136]  They are convinced the American people need to see it.
[00:56:09.156 --> 00:56:15.478]  It has to do with information which is not convenient to the White House, either White House, the Clinton White House or the Bush White House.
[00:56:15.918 --> 00:56:22.340]  And it has to do with an ally who essentially looked the other way and allowed a lot of support for the terrorists who conducted the attack.
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:25.741]  We're here today to call for the release of those 28 pages.
[00:56:26.653 --> 00:56:35.620]  The survivors, civilian heroes, and families of the victims of September 11 terrorist attacks, some of whom are here today, deserve the full truth.
[00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:47.308]  We cannot let page after page of blanked out documents be obscured behind a veil, leaving these families to wonder if there is additional information surrounding these horrible acts.
[00:56:47.608 --> 00:56:52.712]  My son, Matthew C. Salido, was murdered September 11, 2001.
[00:56:55.382 --> 00:56:58.884]  On September 11th, I lost my husband Tom Strada.
[00:56:59.264 --> 00:57:07.028]  My husband Victor was the captain of United Flight 175 that struck the South Tower of the World Trade Center on September 11th at 9.03 a.m.
[00:57:07.308 --> 00:57:14.411]  My father never got to see me compete on my horse, cheer me on at a lacrosse game, or hear me speak at my middle school graduation.
[00:57:15.052 --> 00:57:21.575]  When you tell me there's a security risk and that's the reason
[00:57:23.522 --> 00:57:25.883]  You're not making these public?
[00:57:27.023 --> 00:57:32.044]  Mr. President, I call you a liar.
[00:57:32.564 --> 00:57:35.024]  He would be laughing and saying, you go get him, Terry.
[00:57:35.085 --> 00:57:36.065]  You go get him.
[00:57:36.345 --> 00:57:38.285]  Don't let them get away with this.
[00:57:38.425 --> 00:57:39.745]  Don't let them hide the truth.
[00:57:40.166 --> 00:57:43.506]  And don't let the people that were behind it not pay.
[00:57:43.686 --> 00:57:48.427]  Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make.
[00:57:49.868 --> 00:57:50.968]  Either you are with us,
[00:57:52.401 --> 00:57:53.662]  Well, you are with the terrorists.
[00:57:55.944 --> 00:57:56.404]  Governor Bush.
[00:57:56.525 --> 00:57:56.825]  How we doing?
[00:57:56.845 --> 00:57:57.245]  Good to see you, man.
[00:57:57.265 --> 00:57:57.926]  Alright, good, how you doing?
[00:57:58.686 --> 00:58:03.470]  I was wondering, would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted from the 9-11 Commission report?
[00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:04.751]  Would you be willing to see those released?
[00:58:05.532 --> 00:58:06.613]  Yeah, I'd like to see them, go.
[00:58:07.093 --> 00:58:11.477]  When I dream of my wedding day, I will carry his picture and wish he were there with me.
[00:58:11.677 --> 00:58:12.778]  Yeah, I'd like to see them, go.
[00:58:13.399 --> 00:58:19.004]  My son's dead, and I don't know all the facts.
[00:58:19.404 --> 00:58:20.365]  Yeah, I'd like to see them, go.
[00:58:20.891 --> 00:58:25.377]  Keeping it a secret about those who facilitated it must end now.
[00:58:26.379 --> 00:58:28.021]  Well, hopefully we can get him.
[00:58:28.261 --> 00:58:28.481]  Thank you.
[00:58:38.763 --> 00:58:39.984]  Well, that's it for our show tonight.
