[00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:27.286]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:30.473]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:34.827 --> 00:00:39.870]  We are live on this Friday, August 19th edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:40.811]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:42.352]  I'll be in for the first hour.
[00:00:42.893 --> 00:00:54.581]  At the bottom of the hour, we've got close Trump confidant, of course, former campaign advisor Roger Stone, a regular guest, dropping in for a quick segment to talk about the latest with the campaign.
[00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:57.883]  Of course, today it was announced that Paul Manafort would step down.
[00:00:57.943 --> 00:00:59.144]  That was kind of predictable.
[00:00:59.744 --> 00:01:03.628]  Given that they had hired Stephen Bannon just a couple of days previously.
[00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.591]  Of course, Trump gave a massive speech last night.
[00:01:06.611 --> 00:01:08.973]  We're going to get into segments of that later in the show.
[00:01:09.714 --> 00:01:11.175]  Is he pivoting?
[00:01:11.455 --> 00:01:13.658]  Is he taking on a more conciliatory tone?
[00:01:14.358 --> 00:01:15.479]  And is that wise?
[00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:21.665]  We're going to talk about that with Roger Stone and other issues related to the Trump campaign at the bottom of the hour.
[00:01:22.406 --> 00:01:25.408]  But again, massive news blitz coming up.
[00:01:25.548 --> 00:01:40.096]  If you thought that the Hillary Health scandal was over, then think again, because for the past two weeks the mainstream media have been asserting that this is just a wild conspiracy theory backed up by no credible voices.
[00:01:40.836 --> 00:01:57.159]  Well, they were shook to the core a couple of days ago because we had Dr. Drew come out, America's most trusted physician, and basically make the same observations that other medical experts have been making for several weeks and months now, that there is something seriously wrong with Hillary Clinton.
[00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.640]  Her campaign is backpedaling wildly.
[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.181]  Now they're claiming that a fake document debunks the entire issue, despite the fact that
[00:02:07.481 --> 00:02:22.927]  No serious commentator who drew attention to the questions surrounding Hillary's health in the first place ever cited this fake document as proof they're using it as a straw man, bringing it up over and over again to try and make these questions go away.
[00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:24.847]  Well, they're not going to go away.
[00:02:25.187 --> 00:02:27.928]  Hillary Clinton hasn't had a press conference for 257 days
[00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.600]  And now even the Washington Post is beginning to realize that there's something seriously wrong here.
[00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:41.044]  They can't cover it up any longer.
[00:02:41.064 --> 00:02:46.012]  So again, massive new revelations about Hillary's health coming up in the next segment.
[00:02:46.997 --> 00:03:02.035]  And another story which is probably even bigger than that, the Hillary campaign sent out a campaign email last night to all her subscribers, basically vowing to destroy the conservative media outlet Breitbart.
[00:03:02.595 --> 00:03:09.221]  Not destroy it in the sense of just discredit it, but actually destroy it and take it off the internet.
[00:03:09.721 --> 00:03:18.589]  We've been warning for eight years about the internet kill switch, about this move towards censorship, authoritarianism on the World Wide Web.
[00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:29.819]  Well, wait until you hear what the Hillary Clinton campaign is now saying about Breitbart in the aftermath, of course, of Stephen Bannon linking up with the Trump campaign.
[00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:35.903]  Absolutely chilling content in this email that was sent out by Hillary's campaign.
[00:03:36.304 --> 00:03:37.064]  You won't believe it.
[00:03:37.084 --> 00:03:37.865]  We're going to get to that.
[00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:42.228]  We're also going to get to the religion of peace stripes again in France.
[00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:54.898]  There was a stabbing of a Jewish rabbi within hours, despite the fact that the assailant was screaming out Allah Akbar as he stabbed this Jewish rabbi who was wearing Orthodox dress.
[00:03:55.638 --> 00:04:01.881]  Within hours, the police came out and said, no terrorist motive, no anti-Semitic motive.
[00:04:02.161 --> 00:04:03.641]  We've seen this over and over again.
[00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:17.147]  They're covering up terror attacks throughout Europe because they're becoming so commonplace now that if this narrative is allowed to continue, there's going to be riots, there's going to be civil unrest, there's going to be huge upheaval.
[00:04:18.106 --> 00:04:35.432]  So instead of actually addressing the fact that bringing in millions of Muslim migrants from the Middle East, 21% of whom in many cases support ISIS, is not a good idea and actually trying to readdress that policy, they're simply covering up the terrorist attacks by these Islamists.
[00:04:35.552 --> 00:04:38.093]  This is happening more and more in Europe so we're going to get into that.
[00:04:38.693 --> 00:04:41.914]  We're going to get into the Atlantic basically coming out and saying that...
[00:04:42.854 --> 00:04:46.457]  Any criticism of Hillary Clinton is sexist.
[00:04:46.537 --> 00:04:48.158]  We saw that coming a long way off.
[00:04:48.718 --> 00:04:50.199]  And again, the war for the internet.
[00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:58.124]  Major news websites removing comment sections entirely will tell you how that links into the internet takeover.
[00:04:58.805 --> 00:05:07.691]  But more massive news on Hillary's health and the motive behind Hillary's campaign's email to try and destroy Breitbart.com.
[00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:08.411]  This is huge.
[00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:09.552]  Stay right there.
[00:05:12.549 --> 00:05:16.838]  Americanism, not globalism will be our credo!
[00:05:19.484 --> 00:05:21.528]  Americanism, not globalism!
[00:05:24.904 --> 00:05:28.967]  The era of economic surrender will finally be over.
[00:05:29.247 --> 00:05:35.371]  We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
[00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:43.256]  They have gotten the political establishment and the media establishment to become pure, wanton henchmen of totalitarianism.
[00:05:43.596 --> 00:05:48.399]  If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better.
[00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:52.020]  I think what the Chinese have done is really smart.
[00:06:04.366 --> 00:06:06.107]  Right here in Detroit.
[00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:12.270]  It's all training us to accept less, lowering expectations, a post-industrial world, a new dark age.
[00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.232]  That's what the UN Biological Diversity Assessment 1996 calls for.
[00:06:16.512 --> 00:06:24.796]  When we abandoned the policy of America first, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own.
[00:06:25.196 --> 00:06:29.298]  Not a world, Winston, that gets more beautiful and more technological and stronger.
[00:06:29.578 --> 00:06:32.299]  A world that gets uglier and stupider and more stunted.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.203]  The government should allow Hillary Clinton to become President of the United States.
[00:06:39.724 --> 00:06:41.425]  I voted for Hillary Clinton.
[00:06:41.745 --> 00:06:42.786]  Well, I voted for Hillary.
[00:06:43.046 --> 00:06:45.087]  I guess I have to since I'm working for her as well.
[00:06:45.367 --> 00:06:47.308]  You want an image of the future, Winston?
[00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:49.650]  It's a boot stomping on a human face forever.
[00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:56.134]  Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.
[00:06:56.374 --> 00:07:00.857]  Women are treated discriminated against in all these countries she took money against.
[00:07:01.178 --> 00:07:04.680]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely.
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.601]  They're mistreated.
[00:07:06.281 --> 00:07:07.662]  She claims to be their champion.
[00:07:08.043 --> 00:07:16.669]  Don't look at me, Winston, and see the black circles around my eyes and see how ugly and weak I am expressing myself and dying and I torture people 18 hours a day and I have a horrible life.
[00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:21.233]  That's the beauty of the satanic evil of the priest of power ripping apart humanity.
[00:07:21.353 --> 00:07:22.513]  We're here to hurt humans.
[00:07:22.654 --> 00:07:24.115]  We're here to suck your guts out!
[00:07:40.097 --> 00:07:41.978]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[00:07:42.038 --> 00:07:43.919]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:46.720]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.740]  Alex Jones.
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.582]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:07:50.642 --> 00:07:53.843]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:07:53.863 --> 00:07:55.204]  Deeply I think racist.
[00:07:55.304 --> 00:07:57.124]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[00:07:57.245 --> 00:07:59.045]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[00:07:59.065 --> 00:08:03.147]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[00:08:03.167 --> 00:08:04.328]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:04.388 --> 00:08:09.310]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:08:11.024 --> 00:08:16.018]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:08:24.904 --> 00:08:41.895]  Alex Jones here with a very important note I'd like to add during this live Friday worldwide broadcast, as we have Paul Watson hosting in the first part of the transmission from London, England, and of course LeeAnn McAdoo and the rest of the team at the InfoWars News Center here in Austin, Texas, as well as our contributors from around the world.
[00:08:43.334 --> 00:08:55.818]  What we witnessed yesterday in this 45 minute speech that Donald Trump gave that is posted on InfoWars.com is beyond a pivot as some of the media is calling it.
[00:08:56.918 --> 00:09:04.540]  And the speech is again posted in full at InfoWars.com and it's titled, Donald Trump Just Gave His Best Speech.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.781]  And I agree, this is
[00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:12.290]  The most overall populist speech he's given a true unifier.
[00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.472]  Now the truth is he's been unifying the nation against globalists.
[00:09:16.492 --> 00:09:23.294]  They're trying to dissolve our borders and bring us under foreign rule via the TPP and other multinational combines.
[00:09:23.874 --> 00:09:30.876]  So he has to rally us as Americans and as patriots so that we have a common basic
[00:09:31.576 --> 00:09:37.426]  Theme and system and rule of law so that we can oppose the outside globalist corporate takeover.
[00:09:37.486 --> 00:09:38.007]  It's that simple.
[00:09:38.307 --> 00:09:40.170]  The media calls that being divisive.
[00:09:41.016 --> 00:09:44.798]  Saying that we're going to have the same rules on people that come into our country that other nations have.
[00:09:45.358 --> 00:09:45.778]  It's simple.
[00:09:46.238 --> 00:10:06.346]  But he's always, in his long speeches, talked about being inclusive, talked about really trying to rebuild the inner city areas, talking about bringing in the good immigrants of every race, color, and creed that are vetted, and getting them higher paid jobs, but also making sure that Americans don't lose out, and so the rising tide raises all ships.
[00:10:07.568 --> 00:10:09.489]  But overall it was a focused speech.
[00:10:09.529 --> 00:10:17.213]  It was obviously off a teleprompter and probably written by Bannon in conjunction with Trump because it's Trump's ideas.
[00:10:18.073 --> 00:10:21.735]  So I'd say 90% of it was probably written by Trump just listening to it and watching it.
[00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.176]  And he talked about unifying.
[00:10:25.097 --> 00:10:28.418]  And he talked about... Now this is the most important point.
[00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:34.241]  He repeatedly looks at the crowd who's probably 80% Caucasian.
[00:10:36.707 --> 00:10:44.597]  And says to them in the Carolinas, we are going to have to be inclusive and we're going to have to bring everybody in and rebuild America.
[00:10:44.998 --> 00:10:52.107]  We're going to go out and hire people from every sector and every group and bring everyone together.
[00:10:52.981 --> 00:10:55.702]  That's the opposite message of Obama and MSNBC.
[00:10:55.982 --> 00:10:58.564]  They say, oh, we're all fighting, oh, we're all racist, oh, we're all scum.
[00:10:58.884 --> 00:11:06.047]  Only the state-run media and the state-run systems can unify everyone by brainwashing training and sensitivity training and all this other bull.
[00:11:06.607 --> 00:11:09.348]  When you hear Trump speak, this is what could really save the country.
[00:11:10.029 --> 00:11:13.570]  See, they have to wreck the American system to, on its ashes, build the new world order.
[00:11:13.751 --> 00:11:14.331]  We all know that.
[00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:16.252]  The listeners of this broadcast do.
[00:11:16.632 --> 00:11:18.333]  Many of you before I was even born understood this.
[00:11:18.713 --> 00:11:20.233]  There are people fighting the new world order for 60, 70 years.
[00:11:21.834 --> 00:11:29.879]  But now we have to reach out to the rest of the public at a critical time when globalism is taking the planet over and people are finally ready to see the truth.
[00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:33.401]  We're at that make it or break it point right now.
[00:11:34.401 --> 00:11:41.505]  And throughout the broadcast today, I want to be playing some of these clips on air so that folks can really hear what Trump had to say.
[00:11:41.545 --> 00:11:49.030]  And I hope everybody will go to Infowars.com and get the full speech and share it to everyone you know, because this is a true unification speech.
[00:11:50.031 --> 00:11:56.313]  Based on America and liberty and private property and hard work and freedom and true inclusiveness.
[00:11:57.173 --> 00:12:01.635]  Not unity of the globalist system where they divide us all in little subgroups and then tie us together.
[00:12:01.935 --> 00:12:19.060]  That is the very symbol of fascism, is a bundle of sticks chopped off, symbolizing different captured groups and countries and nationalities and religions tied, tied with leather straps with hatchets above it, symbolizing the force of the state to keep you all under their control.
[00:12:20.066 --> 00:12:21.967]  We are going into a fascist system.
[00:12:21.988 --> 00:12:24.429]  We're going into the broken coalition stratagem.
[00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:25.911]  And it's a fact.
[00:12:26.091 --> 00:12:27.312]  The globalists write books on it.
[00:12:27.332 --> 00:12:29.453]  That's what's so frustrating is, this is not my opinion.
[00:12:30.134 --> 00:12:32.856]  And so I'm going to throw this back to Paul Watson and then Leanne McAdoo and others.
[00:12:32.896 --> 00:12:34.377]  I'll be filing more reports throughout the day.
[00:12:34.417 --> 00:12:40.242]  I've got a special report coming up at the start of the next hour, dealing with all these people that say, don't fear monger about nuclear war.
[00:12:40.742 --> 00:12:45.225]  The reason we've stopped a nuclear war in the last 65 years is because people have been concerned about it.
[00:12:45.786 --> 00:12:48.048]  And most analysts say we're in greater danger than we've ever been.
[00:12:48.508 --> 00:12:49.469]  And so does Donald Trump.
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.566]  Then they say he wants to start a nuclear war because he wants detente.
[00:12:53.947 --> 00:12:54.668]  This is crazy.
[00:12:55.782 --> 00:12:58.503]  Now back to Paul Joseph Watson from London, England.
[00:12:58.523 --> 00:13:00.384]  But this is a very exciting speech.
[00:13:00.404 --> 00:13:04.366]  The media is trying to ignore it or they're trying to spin it that, oh, he was so hateful.
[00:13:04.866 --> 00:13:06.346]  Now he's backtracking and being nice.
[00:13:07.167 --> 00:13:11.308]  He has put forward an olive branch saying, look, I say a lot of things on the campaign trail in the heat of battle.
[00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:12.989]  Some of it, you know, I could have said better.
[00:13:13.429 --> 00:13:14.410]  So it is an olive branch.
[00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:20.232]  But he had to unify Americans first before we can then start reaching out to everybody else.
[00:13:20.572 --> 00:13:21.653]  We have to have an identity.
[00:13:22.694 --> 00:13:25.220]  Before we can continue on as a nation.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:30.893]  The globals want to kill our identity and bring in an absolute total and complete corporate tyranny.
[00:13:31.073 --> 00:13:31.875]  Now back to Paul Watson.
[00:13:33.069 --> 00:13:36.711]  That was Alex Jones talking about Donald Trump's speech yesterday.
[00:13:36.751 --> 00:13:40.073]  We're going to have excerpts of that coming up later in the show.
[00:13:40.593 --> 00:13:47.096]  But I want to turn back again to Hillary's health because the Clinton campaign is in damage control mode right now.
[00:13:47.476 --> 00:13:50.618]  They thought they could dismiss this as a conspiracy theory.
[00:13:50.898 --> 00:13:53.780]  They thought they could own that narrative and they can't.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:05.223]  They're getting overwhelmed every single day by expert after expert agreeing with each other, saying the same thing, that there's something majorly wrong with Hillary Clinton's health.
[00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:16.007]  Not just from her personal behaviour, which we've seen, the bizarre seizure-type episodes, the twitching, the inability to walk, the inability to stay on her feet, the pillows.
[00:14:16.747 --> 00:14:19.289]  This is something that Donald Trump brought up during the primaries.
[00:14:19.309 --> 00:14:21.611]  Do you mean the questions about Secretary Clinton's health?
[00:14:21.631 --> 00:14:23.292]  Is that what you're referring to?
[00:14:47.873 --> 00:14:53.236]  Yes, he has said that she doesn't have the strength or the stamina for a very long time.
[00:14:53.336 --> 00:14:54.677]  That part is nothing new.
[00:14:54.757 --> 00:15:08.164]  What's new are the other reports of the observations of Hillary Clinton's behavior and mannerisms, specifically with what you just showed in those previous clips, as well as her dysphagia, the fact that she's fallen.
[00:15:08.424 --> 00:15:11.586]  She has had a concussion.
[00:15:11.706 --> 00:15:13.227]  There's no indication that she...
[00:15:14.686 --> 00:15:16.888]  Let's just step back for one second.
[00:15:17.448 --> 00:15:19.951]  We did get this reaction from her doctor.
[00:15:19.971 --> 00:15:21.292]  I just want to read that to you.
[00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:28.278]  Who says, quote, as Secretary Clinton's longtime physician, I released a medical statement during the campaign indicating that she is in excellent health.
[00:15:28.659 --> 00:15:34.224]  I have recently been made aware of allegedly leaked medical documents regarding Secretary Clinton with my name on them.
[00:15:34.244 --> 00:15:38.688]  These documents are false, were not written by me, and are not based on any medical facts.
[00:15:39.028 --> 00:15:47.079]  To reiterate what I said in my previous statement, Secretary Clinton is in excellent health and fit to serve as President of the United States.
[00:15:47.419 --> 00:15:54.168]  So these health questions have been debunked, Katrina, and yet Donald Trump continues to try to stir them up.
[00:15:54.229 --> 00:15:56.652]  Is that responsible for someone who's running for President?
[00:15:58.729 --> 00:16:00.910]  Well, he's not talking about her health record.
[00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:05.551]  He's talking about specific observations, just like some of the clips that you've shown.
[00:16:05.871 --> 00:16:10.193]  And it is extremely important to note that Hillary Clinton has taken a lot of time off the campaign trail.
[00:16:10.273 --> 00:16:12.993]  He's clearly trying to spin up some of that speculation.
[00:16:14.634 --> 00:16:16.755]  Well, it's something that needs to be addressed.
[00:16:16.795 --> 00:16:19.636]  She's taken a lot of time off the campaign trail.
[00:16:19.936 --> 00:16:22.256]  She hasn't had a press conference this year.
[00:16:22.697 --> 00:16:23.717]  Why don't we just have Ms.
[00:16:23.757 --> 00:16:27.238]  Clinton have a press conference, and she can answer all of these questions.
[00:16:28.311 --> 00:16:40.663]  Now, you heard there the MSNBC commentator, the host, again talking over the Trump campaign spokeswoman, not even allowing her to make her point, claiming that the, quote, issue had been debunked.
[00:16:41.464 --> 00:16:49.751]  Now they're doing that by citing this fake document that was circulating on Twitter that purported to be from Hillary Clinton's personal physician.
[00:16:50.232 --> 00:16:50.772]  It wasn't.
[00:16:51.253 --> 00:16:52.434]  Everybody knew it wasn't.
[00:16:52.794 --> 00:16:58.860]  Nobody, no serious commentator who has been talking about Hillary's health ever used that document as proof.
[00:16:59.421 --> 00:17:02.704]  I didn't use it in the viral video that's now got over 3 million views.
[00:17:03.164 --> 00:17:05.527]  Sean Hannity didn't use it on Fox News.
[00:17:05.887 --> 00:17:07.549]  Mike Cernovich didn't use it.
[00:17:07.889 --> 00:17:11.833]  When Dr. Drew came out and talked about that, this issue, he didn't use it.
[00:17:12.173 --> 00:17:14.696]  Nobody is citing that document as proof.
[00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:16.478]  We know it's a fake document.
[00:17:16.738 --> 00:17:19.101]  We knew it was a fake document from minute one.
[00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:28.431]  So why did the Clinton campaign draw attention to a fake document that no serious commentator had even cited as proof?
[00:17:28.852 --> 00:17:30.213]  Because it's a straw man.
[00:17:30.734 --> 00:17:33.216]  They can hold this up and say, look at this fake document.
[00:17:33.316 --> 00:17:34.497]  It's so amateurish.
[00:17:34.937 --> 00:17:36.779]  It's so obviously been debunked.
[00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:43.884]  Therefore, all the other questions made by serious observers, medical experts about Hillary's health, are also debunked.
[00:17:44.364 --> 00:17:46.126]  You see that little trick they're playing?
[00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:50.089]  Well, they've got a problem because every single day, prominent people are coming out.
[00:17:50.129 --> 00:17:51.710]  We had Dr Drew two days ago.
[00:17:52.230 --> 00:18:01.137]  Lo and behold, KABC, that affiliate out of, I think it's Los Angeles, deleted the original Dr. Drew interview from their website.
[00:18:01.697 --> 00:18:03.138]  You go there now, it's gone.
[00:18:03.739 --> 00:18:05.340]  It's been memory-holed.
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.983]  Now, there's no indication that Dr. Drew himself wanted them to do that, but it's disappeared.
[00:18:10.564 --> 00:18:12.425]  Thankfully, I uploaded it to YouTube.
[00:18:12.485 --> 00:18:15.908]  It's got probably 300,000 views by now on just an audio file.
[00:18:16.488 --> 00:18:18.590]  They can't keep this issue down.
[00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.811]  It's gonna keep coming back, and it has again today.
[00:18:21.832 --> 00:18:23.392]  This is up on Infowars.com.
[00:18:23.952 --> 00:18:33.614]  Not a conspiracy theorist, another expert, radiologist Dr. Milton R. Wolfe, who says that Hillary Clinton has a quote, serious underlying disease.
[00:18:34.455 --> 00:18:42.176]  Again, that's not from a fake document, that's not from a conspiracy theorist, that's from a practicing physician.
[00:18:42.996 --> 00:18:49.678]  Dr. Milton R. Wolfe says that Hillary Clinton has a serious underlying disease that her campaign is hiding from the American people.
[00:18:50.698 --> 00:19:01.828]  And he reached out to me last night directly to question why Hillary is being given this blood thinner, Coumadin, which is a drug used to prevent heart attacks, strokes and blood clots in veins and arteries.
[00:19:02.229 --> 00:19:09.716]  According to Wolf, this is a quote, Hillary's doctors know you would never, never give Coumadin to normal, healthy patients.
[00:19:09.776 --> 00:19:10.737]  It's too dangerous.
[00:19:11.297 --> 00:19:20.184]  And the fact that she's taking this drug must mean, quote, her risk of morbidity from blood clots without Coumadin must be substantial.
[00:19:20.684 --> 00:19:33.534]  He goes on to say that in his medical expert experience, people who take Coumadin are at risk of intercranial haemorrhage and suffer from falls on a regular basis.
[00:19:33.654 --> 00:19:37.937]  Now isn't that interesting, given what we've seen with Hillary's handlers
[00:19:38.317 --> 00:19:44.720]  The Secret Service agents having to constantly prop her up, even when she's standing on huge platforms.
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:53.343]  So this is a serious medical expert, a practicing physician, who's actually a Ted Cruz supporter, so he's not in the can for Donald Trump.
[00:19:53.903 --> 00:20:05.600]  Saying that the medication that Hillary Clinton is receiving clearly suggests that she has a serious underlying disease and the Clinton campaign is hiding it from the American people.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.984]  We'll be back with the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:20:08.024 --> 00:20:08.625]  Don't go away.
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:20.201]  As the 21st century began, human evolution was at a turning point.
[00:20:21.001 --> 00:20:36.385]  Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the smartest, the fastest reproduced in greater numbers than the rest, a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man, now began to favor different traits.
[00:20:37.525 --> 00:20:43.592]  Most science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more civilized and more intelligent.
[00:20:44.112 --> 00:20:48.437]  But as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction.
[00:20:48.977 --> 00:20:49.838]  A dumbing down.
[00:20:50.459 --> 00:20:56.886]  Harvard researchers have found children who live in high fluoride areas have significantly lower IQs.
[00:20:57.346 --> 00:21:01.308]  Enjoy your extra big-ass fry!
[00:21:01.348 --> 00:21:06.191]  Researchers found members of Congress, on average, speak at a 10th grade level.
[00:21:06.771 --> 00:21:09.432]  Most Americans read at an 8th or 9th grade level.
[00:21:09.512 --> 00:21:12.154]  Look now, talk slow so you can understand me.
[00:21:12.214 --> 00:21:18.577]  It was just a few thousand years ago that our ancestors were using primitive breaths to communicate.
[00:21:18.797 --> 00:21:22.339]  Hillary's a good leader.
[00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:23.420]  I trust Hillary.
[00:21:27.187 --> 00:21:28.888]  I stand here as a free slave.
[00:21:28.928 --> 00:21:29.949]  You're so dumb.
[00:21:30.449 --> 00:21:31.530]  You are really dumb.
[00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:32.471]  For real.
[00:21:34.071 --> 00:21:37.934]  Mankind became stupider at a frightening rate.
[00:21:37.974 --> 00:21:43.237]  You want to know what I found out?
[00:21:43.777 --> 00:21:46.919]  Most of England speaks American-ish.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.341]  I don't feel no ways tired.
[00:21:52.529 --> 00:22:05.119]  I believe that our education, like such as South Africa and Iraq, everywhere like such as, and I believe that they should, our education over here in the U.S.
[00:22:05.179 --> 00:22:08.002]  should help the U.S., or should help South Africa.
[00:22:08.022 --> 00:22:08.942]  What does that mean?
[00:22:09.022 --> 00:22:15.007]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the Journal of Pediatrics.
[00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:32.323]  We now go live to violence channel correspondent for Micah Davis at the extreme court with highlights on today's trial.
[00:22:33.063 --> 00:22:38.184]  Good to see you in this exercise in transparency and democracy.
[00:22:38.885 --> 00:22:43.046]  Is that what it is?
[00:22:54.668 --> 00:23:01.871]  A great dust bull had ravaged food supplies, and the number one movie in the country was called Ass.
[00:23:02.411 --> 00:23:05.712]  Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory.
[00:23:05.752 --> 00:23:06.752]  That's ridiculous.
[00:23:06.792 --> 00:23:08.213]  That doesn't make any sense.
[00:23:08.593 --> 00:23:10.714]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[00:23:10.834 --> 00:23:11.594]  What does that mean?
[00:23:11.754 --> 00:23:13.455]  How many sides does a triangle have?
[00:23:13.575 --> 00:23:14.595]  Damn.
[00:23:14.755 --> 00:23:14.875]  Four.
[00:23:15.235 --> 00:23:17.116]  There's no side.
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.162]  What's Osama Bin Laden most infamous for?
[00:23:24.482 --> 00:23:25.122]  Osama?
[00:23:25.202 --> 00:23:25.642]  Yeah.
[00:23:25.763 --> 00:23:26.383]  Or Obama?
[00:23:26.703 --> 00:23:27.204]  Osama.
[00:23:27.944 --> 00:23:29.225]  I have no idea who Osama is.
[00:23:29.465 --> 00:23:40.752]  A little further south from that facility, there's a completely separate building where they, get this, change raw sewage water into water people drink.
[00:23:40.872 --> 00:23:41.233]  Water.
[00:23:42.033 --> 00:23:42.874]  They got the toilet?
[00:23:43.114 --> 00:23:44.875]  But Brondo's got what plants crave.
[00:23:45.195 --> 00:23:46.296]  It's got electrolytes.
[00:23:46.949 --> 00:23:53.234]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:23:54.235 --> 00:23:56.257]  It's a circus, everybody!
[00:23:56.297 --> 00:23:56.517]  Look!
[00:23:56.577 --> 00:23:56.737]  Look!
[00:23:57.738 --> 00:23:59.360]  I did that on purpose!
[00:24:20.111 --> 00:24:20.511]  We are back.
[00:24:20.651 --> 00:24:22.372]  It's the Alex Jones Show Live.
[00:24:22.433 --> 00:24:24.834]  Roger Stone is coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:24:24.874 --> 00:24:29.537]  We're going to get back into Hillary's health and other news-related issues shortly.
[00:24:29.577 --> 00:24:32.439]  But first I want to tell you about Amerigeddon.
[00:24:32.619 --> 00:24:38.323]  This is the early DVD release special with two free Alex Jones documentaries.
[00:24:38.363 --> 00:24:41.345]  So you get four documentaries in total.
[00:24:41.705 --> 00:24:43.947]  This is the DVD director's cut special.
[00:24:44.787 --> 00:24:46.609]  This is the movie that everybody's talking about.
[00:24:46.649 --> 00:24:52.056]  Citizens fight for survival when an attack on the energy grid leaves America in a state of martial law.
[00:24:52.076 --> 00:25:02.449]  A dire warning of a wake-up call of what might be our future when a globalist terrorist organization aligned with the UN disables the United States power grid and institutes martial law.
[00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:10.277]  So you get two Amerageddon DVDs and two more DVDs from Alex Jones completely free.
[00:25:10.818 --> 00:25:12.960]  You save over $40.
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:16.344]  That's $39.90 for four DVDs.
[00:25:16.824 --> 00:25:19.647]  This is the sales special at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:25:20.208 --> 00:25:22.949]  And again, it goes to growing our broadcast.
[00:25:22.989 --> 00:25:30.593]  Not only can you get these DVDs, use them to educate people to start conversations about these vital issues, but it supports us.
[00:25:30.633 --> 00:25:32.414]  It helps us hire new people.
[00:25:32.514 --> 00:25:37.437]  It helps us send people out to all these events that you've seen us confront the mainstream media directly at.
[00:25:38.097 --> 00:25:39.217]  That's where it all goes.
[00:25:39.398 --> 00:25:47.161]  It's vitally important that you support us by getting the Amerigeddon early DVD release special at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:25:48.402 --> 00:25:51.691]  Few minutes left here in this segment, and this is absolutely huge.
[00:25:51.752 --> 00:25:54.961]  This just came out a couple of hours ago over at the Daily Caller.
[00:25:55.602 --> 00:25:56.224]  Listen to this.
[00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:00.712]  Hillary campaign vows to destroy opposition website.
[00:26:01.193 --> 00:26:10.839]  Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign has sent out a fundraising email, arguing that the website Breitbart News has, quote, no right to exist.
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:12.140]  That's the quote!
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.802]  No right to exist!
[00:26:15.262 --> 00:26:20.586]  And suggests that if elected, the website will be shut down entirely.
[00:26:21.266 --> 00:26:25.589]  Now of course we had the link up with Bannon and the Trump campaign a couple of days ago.
[00:26:26.209 --> 00:26:32.452]  Now Clinton, even if she wins the election, is saying that she will go on to destroy Breitbart.
[00:26:32.873 --> 00:26:42.138]  Now of course if they want to destroy Breitbart, they want to destroy the Drudge Report, they want to destroy the Daily Caller, they want to destroy InfoWars.com.
[00:26:42.838 --> 00:26:44.900]  No right to exist!
[00:26:45.765 --> 00:26:49.367]  This is a quote from the email sent out by the Clinton campaign.
[00:26:49.708 --> 00:26:52.850]  Quote, we've had a conservative media in this country for a while.
[00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:55.071]  This was sent out by Christina Reynolds.
[00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:59.194]  I don't always like what they have to say, but I respect their role and their right to exist.
[00:27:00.578 --> 00:27:09.562]  Reynolds' acknowledgement that the regular conservative media has a right to exist, though, is used to contrast it with Breitbart, which apparently has no such right.
[00:27:10.223 --> 00:27:19.307]  So they're saying that all the cockservative websites that were behind Ted Cruz that have thrown Donald Trump under a bus, they're perfectly fine.
[00:27:19.567 --> 00:27:21.368]  We're going to tolerate those websites.
[00:27:21.748 --> 00:27:23.189]  But Breitbart.com?
[00:27:23.669 --> 00:27:24.670]  No way.
[00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:26.150]  No right to exist.
[00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:27.751]  This is what the email goes on to say.
[00:27:27.771 --> 00:27:29.192]  This is chilling.
[00:27:29.992 --> 00:27:31.653]  Breitbart is something different.
[00:27:31.913 --> 00:27:34.615]  They make Fox News look like a Democratic Party pamphlet.
[00:27:34.855 --> 00:27:36.256]  They're a different breed altogether.
[00:27:36.596 --> 00:27:38.798]  Not just conservative, but radical!
[00:27:39.378 --> 00:27:40.018]  Bigoted!
[00:27:40.539 --> 00:27:48.023]  Anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic, conspiracy peddlers, who've never been and never should be anywhere near the levers of power in this country.
[00:27:48.764 --> 00:27:49.725]  Again, bigoted.
[00:27:50.345 --> 00:27:54.668]  The guy is basically, the website is basically dominated by Milo Yiannopoulos.
[00:27:56.823 --> 00:28:00.747]  Who is a very prominent member of the LGBT community.
[00:28:01.087 --> 00:28:03.750]  There's no antisemitism on there whatsoever.
[00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:07.213]  They tell the truth about migrant crime.
[00:28:07.273 --> 00:28:08.995]  Apparently that's Islamophobic now.
[00:28:09.555 --> 00:28:12.818]  You know, CNN's Sally Cohn says that Sharia law is progressive.
[00:28:13.239 --> 00:28:20.426]  We've got the BBC coming out with documentaries saying that anyone who even mentions Sharia law is an Islamophobe.
[00:28:20.726 --> 00:28:28.131]  So their view of what is bigoted and anti-Muslim is merely questioning the belief system of Islam.
[00:28:28.411 --> 00:28:33.975]  Which is not a race, but to them that's racist, that's bigoted, that's anti-Muslim.
[00:28:34.395 --> 00:28:42.941]  And now the Clinton campaign is vowing to destroy, destroy Breitbart.com after the election.
[00:28:43.401 --> 00:28:46.403]  Shut down their entire website.
[00:28:46.823 --> 00:28:50.066]  Complete contempt for free speech for the First Amendment.
[00:28:50.726 --> 00:28:55.227]  And remember, it's coming up here, I believe, just in a few days.
[00:28:55.907 --> 00:29:00.328]  This is out of the BBC, US ready to hand over the Internet's naming system.
[00:29:00.368 --> 00:29:03.809]  Well, isn't this an interesting correlation?
[00:29:04.209 --> 00:29:13.532]  The US has confirmed it's finally ready to cede power of the Internet's naming system, ending the almost 20-year process to hand over a crucial part of the Internet's governance.
[00:29:14.412 --> 00:29:30.502]  So they're basically handing over control of the domain name system to the United Nations, which will then be dominated by countries that don't quite have the same view on free speech as the United States, countries like China and Russia.
[00:29:31.023 --> 00:29:38.848]  In fact, Breitbart itself reported, two months left until Obama gives dictators control of the internet.
[00:29:39.608 --> 00:29:54.331]  So they're about to give the UN, dominated by Russia and China, control of the internet to shut down free speech right as Hillary Clinton's campaign says that certain conservative websites like Breitbart.com don't have the right to exist.
[00:29:54.431 --> 00:29:56.331]  This is absolutely chilling.
[00:29:56.371 --> 00:29:59.432]  We'll be back with Roger Stone on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:59.892 --> 00:30:01.232]  Infowars.com.
[00:30:01.252 --> 00:30:02.572]  We'll be back.
[00:30:03.492 --> 00:30:06.153]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.589 --> 00:30:16.214]  State Department, 400 million to Iran was contingent on US prisoners release.
[00:30:16.434 --> 00:30:24.381]  The State Department admitted Thursday that the US would not hand over 400 million in cash to Iran until it released four American hostages.
[00:30:24.541 --> 00:30:28.664]  Two weeks after, President Obama insisted the payment was not a ransom.
[00:30:28.784 --> 00:30:38.012]  State Department spokesman John Kirby was asked at Thursday's press briefing, in basic English, you're saying you wouldn't give them 400 million in cash until the
[00:30:38.132 --> 00:30:39.513]  Prisoners were released, correct?
[00:30:39.653 --> 00:30:40.993]  That's correct, Kirby replied.
[00:30:41.173 --> 00:30:44.995]  In an August 4th press conference, President Obama said the opposite.
[00:30:45.055 --> 00:30:46.236]  We do not pay ransom.
[00:30:46.376 --> 00:30:50.377]  We didn't hear and we won't in the future, the president told reporters.
[00:30:50.598 --> 00:30:57.781]  Speaking of the January 17th payment and hostage release, families know we have a policy that we don't pay ransom.
[00:30:57.881 --> 00:31:04.804]  And the notion that we would somehow start now in this high profile way defies logic Obama added at the time.
[00:31:04.884 --> 00:31:05.464]  Well, guess what?
[00:31:05.504 --> 00:31:06.685]  The cat's out of the bag.
[00:31:06.885 --> 00:31:07.545]  You lied.
[00:31:07.665 --> 00:31:09.926]  We call it InfoWars.com.
[00:31:10.347 --> 00:31:12.148]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:12.228 --> 00:31:14.109]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:14.249 --> 00:31:17.091]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:17.151 --> 00:31:23.014]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:23.234 --> 00:31:32.120]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.

[00:31:39.947 --> 00:31:47.659]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:48.941]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:52.471]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:52.852 --> 00:31:57.516]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:57.676 --> 00:32:04.142]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:32:04.382 --> 00:32:08.486]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4wrestore.com.
[00:32:10.302 --> 00:32:19.312]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:32:19.393 --> 00:32:27.522]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:32:27.802 --> 00:32:32.484]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:32:46.629 --> 00:32:53.492]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:32:53.672 --> 00:32:58.013]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[00:33:30.585 --> 00:33:32.005]  We're back with the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:32.085 --> 00:33:43.328]  I've joined with Roger Stone on the line, but in the meantime, I want to direct your attention to infowarslife.com, where we have living defense at 20% off for a limited time.

[00:34:36.606 --> 00:34:38.428]  You've seen it with the Hillary's health issue.
[00:34:38.888 --> 00:34:47.312]  I mean this was circulating around for six months or so, but we put it back at the top of the agenda with that viral video back a couple of weeks ago.
[00:34:47.752 --> 00:34:49.213]  Now everybody's talking about it.
[00:34:49.553 --> 00:34:53.875]  Now the Clinton campaign is in damage control mode.
[00:34:54.635 --> 00:34:59.497]  That's why it's really important for you to support us, to allow us to challenge the mainstream media directly.
[00:34:59.817 --> 00:35:03.239]  We're not funded by hundreds of millions of dollars from George Soros.

[00:35:12.496 --> 00:35:15.159]  We're not funded by giant pharmaceutical companies.
[00:35:15.419 --> 00:35:17.961]  We're funded by you and you alone.
[00:35:18.362 --> 00:35:23.126]  So please, it's vital to get the products at Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:24.187 --> 00:35:27.751]  Now going back to what we were covering before the break, this is absolutely massive.
[00:35:28.476 --> 00:35:39.561]  The Hillary campaign sent out an email vowing to destroy Breitbart.com, saying that, oh, we can tolerate some conservative websites, but this one doesn't have a right to exist.
[00:35:40.321 --> 00:35:48.425]  They're openly baring their teeth, about to sink their fangs into the First Amendment if Hillary wins this election.
[00:35:49.145 --> 00:36:03.790]  And just by coincidence, Barack Obama is about to hand over control of the Internet to the United Nations, dominated by these countries who have crushed free speech in the past, who have silenced dissidents.
[00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:17.415]  Remember, for the past eight years, intermittently, we've had the Obama administration come out and signal that it could back this Internet kill switch used by the likes of the Communist Chinese government.
[00:36:18.095 --> 00:36:29.718]  Who shut down certain parts of the internet, for example, when there's civil unrest, when there's a protest, when some particularly damaging piece of information comes out about a politician, somebody in the government.
[00:36:30.058 --> 00:36:34.959]  They have the power to shut down certain parts of the internet in certain areas of the country.
[00:36:35.399 --> 00:36:41.160]  The Obama administration and other people like Joe Lieberman have supported that on a routine basis.
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.001]  This is going to make it easier for them to do that.
[00:36:44.781 --> 00:36:48.224]  Now, concurrent to this, we've got this story out of the Daily Caller again.
[00:36:48.244 --> 00:36:53.248]  NPR deletes comment, says commenters are too old and male.
[00:36:53.908 --> 00:37:03.796]  National Public Radio is the latest online publication to eliminate public comments on its articles, defending the decision by saying few people actually comment.
[00:37:03.876 --> 00:37:05.877]  And those who do are typically older men.
[00:37:06.238 --> 00:37:09.921]  And of course, they don't count because they have white male privilege.
[00:37:10.501 --> 00:37:13.584]  That means we can just ostracize them and pretend they don't exist.
[00:37:13.664 --> 00:37:15.326]  That's their great privilege that they have.
[00:37:15.947 --> 00:37:19.450]  NPR says its decision to get rid of comments is mostly based on engagement.
[00:37:20.322 --> 00:37:23.524]  Now if this was one example, then it would be a different thing.
[00:37:24.064 --> 00:37:36.852]  But we've tracked for the past three, four years, all these major websites, Time Magazine, Daily Beast, The Verge, you can go on down the list, removing comment sections from their websites entirely.
[00:37:37.253 --> 00:37:38.413]  Why are they doing that?
[00:37:38.894 --> 00:37:40.275]  Well it's because studies have shown
[00:37:41.095 --> 00:37:52.159]  That when readers read an article, they don't judge its accuracy based on the content of the article, they judge it based on what the respondents are saying in the comment section.
[00:37:52.479 --> 00:38:01.782]  That's why the left has declared war on comment sections, because time and time again their narrative is being completely eviscerated.
[00:38:02.282 --> 00:38:09.765]  So now they're saying, we'll cut off our nose to spite our face, we'll just get rid of the comment section entirely, even though that's going to cost them a ton of traffic.
[00:38:10.325 --> 00:38:13.706]  Because that's how desperate they are to control the narrative.
[00:38:13.986 --> 00:38:15.947]  But we have Roger Stone on the line now.
[00:38:16.007 --> 00:38:17.188]  We'll get back into the news.
[00:38:17.768 --> 00:38:19.489]  Roger, you need no introduction.
[00:38:19.509 --> 00:38:21.029]  Of course, you've been on several times before.
[00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:24.671]  You wanted to pop in with an update, so you've got the floor.
[00:38:24.771 --> 00:38:25.871]  Tell us the latest.
[00:38:26.431 --> 00:38:26.792]  Thank you.
[00:38:26.832 --> 00:38:27.752]  That's very kind.
[00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:29.953]  I was on my way to lunch.
[00:38:30.013 --> 00:38:34.955]  First of all, let me apologize for wearing a button-down shirt with a vested suit.
[00:38:35.095 --> 00:38:36.596]  I understand it isn't done.
[00:38:36.736 --> 00:38:37.116]  However,
[00:38:38.056 --> 00:38:41.199]  When I checked from the laundry, it was the only clean white shirt I had.
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:49.908]  Anyway, I'm delighted to be with you because I think the events in today's Trump campaign need to be explained.
[00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:57.936]  In essence here, Paul Manafort became concerned that the unfounded and baseless attacks on him
[00:38:58.797 --> 00:39:15.697]  Which were orchestrated by Sidney Blumenthal, the dirty trickster and hitman who works for Hillary, paid for by Victor Pinchuk, the Ukrainian billionaire who purchased the Ukrainian coup from the Clintons for a $10 million
[00:39:17.359 --> 00:39:33.929]  Uh, contribution to the Clinton Foundation, uh, and these hoked up baseless stories in which we have a ledger, uh, alleging Manafort took, uh, payments for which there is no financial trail or record, evidence that would never stand up in court.
[00:39:33.989 --> 00:39:42.775]  A story, uh, that, uh, in the New York Times that admits that he is not accused of any wrongdoing, that no government official has accused him of wrongdoing.
[00:39:43.396 --> 00:39:47.699]  Manfred has not worked for the government of Ukraine or Russia.
[00:39:48.099 --> 00:39:56.605]  He worked for a democratic political party through two difficult parliamentary elections and a presidential election.
[00:39:57.165 --> 00:40:05.771]  Paul, you try electing a guy named Kozlowski to the Ukrainian parliament in a district that has more cows than people.
[00:40:06.491 --> 00:40:25.657]  Uh, his payments were legal and there's no evidence of wrongdoing, but, uh, we know that, uh, that Sidney Blumenthal, the hitman who works for Hillary, has had a phalanx of investigators all over Kiev and Moscow trying to dig dirt up on Manafort.
[00:40:26.177 --> 00:40:28.217]  This is the most they could find.
[00:40:28.298 --> 00:40:29.878]  There is no there there.
[00:40:29.938 --> 00:40:32.819]  In fact, I would suggest to you that this alleged
[00:40:34.162 --> 00:40:42.689]  A ledger that shows payments to him may be the product of Ukrainian intelligence controlled by the billionaire Pinchuk.
[00:40:43.189 --> 00:40:59.643]  So Manafort, being a professional and recognizing that the mainstream media is not going to be objective about this, and also recognizing that this controversy feeds the false theme of
[00:41:01.015 --> 00:41:21.556]  Trump-Putin-Russia Manifort, which is modern-day McCarthyism, because Trump is not for war, because he's for detente with the Russians and hard-headed negotiations that would allow us to work together to eradicate ISIS, we question his patriotism.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:29.483]  The Clinton people saying that Manafort and Trump are in league with Putin says they're working against the interests of their country.
[00:41:29.663 --> 00:41:30.404]  It's treasonous.
[00:41:30.664 --> 00:41:31.304]  It's false.
[00:41:31.904 --> 00:41:34.326]  It has no basis in fact.
[00:41:34.446 --> 00:41:42.189]  But this entire narrative about Manafort and the Ukraine is spun by the Clinton thugs was a distraction.
[00:41:42.329 --> 00:41:50.033]  So Manafort being a professional and having left the campaign structurally better
[00:41:51.377 --> 00:41:51.657]  Okay.
[00:42:08.376 --> 00:42:21.720]  That allegations that Corey Lewandowski is out trying to peddle that there was some kind of financial impropriety on Manafort's part are actionable, if anybody chooses to write that.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:32.463]  But he did what a political pro would do, step aside, but not before he understood this news cycle and helped install
[00:42:33.203 --> 00:42:45.830]  The bomb-throwing firebrand and friend of mine, and now friend of Manafort's, Stephen K. Bannon, and Kelly Conway, who I think is great and have a lot of confidence in.
[00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:49.732]  So that's what really transpired here.
[00:42:49.792 --> 00:42:52.553]  This is a selfless act on Manafort's part.
[00:42:52.933 --> 00:42:59.237]  It's what, and I hate that this is a filibuster, Paul, but it's what Corey Lewandowski should have done
[00:43:00.037 --> 00:43:06.062]  When he was accused of manhandling a reporter in the interests of Donald Trump in the campaign.
[00:43:06.463 --> 00:43:11.107]  Mr. Lewandowski may say, well, I was innocent, but Manafort is also innocent.
[00:43:11.747 --> 00:43:13.969]  Although there's more evidence in Corey's case.
[00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:16.432]  So that's what's really transpiring here.
[00:43:17.012 --> 00:43:21.897]  The Ukrainian government of Pinchuk may be trying to purchase an election.
[00:43:22.017 --> 00:43:24.780]  They would like to disqualify Donald Trump.
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:31.706]  So, yes, there's internal Ukrainian politics here, but this fellow, working through his U.S.
[00:43:31.847 --> 00:43:40.895]  agents, purchased the coup that toppled a Democratic elected president in Ukraine.
[00:43:41.556 --> 00:43:43.137]  He gave so much to the Clintons.
[00:43:43.237 --> 00:43:47.260]  I believe in that year, he moved ahead of the Saudis and perhaps the Chinese.
[00:43:48.021 --> 00:43:51.924]  That's the backstory that those who are watching us today need to know.
[00:43:53.231 --> 00:44:05.234]  So, we've got the media again obsessing, Roger, about Russia interfering in the US election, when this could be an example of that very thing, but a concrete effort by the government of Ukraine to do that very same thing.
[00:44:05.774 --> 00:44:07.874]  On the flip side, we've got the Clinton administration.
[00:44:07.894 --> 00:44:15.936]  Yes, and at the same time, the mainstream media, including the New York Times, choose to ignore the overseas adventures of the Podesta brothers.
[00:44:16.676 --> 00:44:24.326]  Who have illicitly profited from all these foreign governments based on their Clinton connections.
[00:44:24.807 --> 00:44:34.080]  Podesta throws out some emails where he and Manafort have a small piece of business together, violating the confidence of his client.
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:38.986]  And also getting the reporter to clean up the story a little bit in terms of his involvement.
[00:44:39.867 --> 00:44:44.232]  But more about Mr. Podesta and Mr. Blumenthal soon.
[00:44:44.272 --> 00:44:50.460]  Let me remind your listeners, Sidney Blumenthal is the man who we now know indisputably made up the
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:51.441]  That's a lie.
[00:45:08.172 --> 00:45:14.837]  A Jew-hating, Israel-hating radical, like Blumenthal himself.
[00:45:15.478 --> 00:45:20.762]  This is a guy, Sidney Blumenthal, who thinks he's Ted Sorensen, but in fact he's Al Capone.
[00:45:21.903 --> 00:45:25.125]  This guy will do anything, legal or illegal.
[00:45:25.606 --> 00:45:36.074]  As we also know from the emails, he was urging Hillary to topple Gaddafi, not disclosing that he himself would make millions out of that, based on some side dealings.
[00:45:37.915 --> 00:45:43.018]  Now, Roger, we've got... Hillary Clinton basically has more skeletons in her closet than a crypt.
[00:45:43.398 --> 00:45:45.939]  The New York Times is not interested in digging up the dirt.
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:48.201]  The Washington Post isn't interested.
[00:45:48.441 --> 00:45:49.381]  It's all about Manafort.
[00:45:49.421 --> 00:45:50.202]  It's all about Trump.
[00:45:50.542 --> 00:45:53.003]  We've got pay-for-play with the Clinton Foundation.
[00:45:53.603 --> 00:45:59.607]  You were talking about, I believe yesterday, these WikiLeaks email releases which Assange promised weeks ago.
[00:46:00.027 --> 00:46:03.849]  You're saying that this could be the October surprise for Hillary Clinton.
[00:46:04.249 --> 00:46:07.111]  What do you think is going to be in those emails when they are leaked?
[00:46:07.731 --> 00:46:09.212]  Well, but who knows?
[00:46:09.853 --> 00:46:31.570]  I believe, based on my sources of information, that Mr. Assange, who I regard as a hero, and someone who's been fighting the deep state, both Republican and Democrat, all neocons, all for war, all globalists, he has released the first DNC documents to cataclysmic effect.
[00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:32.931]  But I would point out again,
[00:46:33.692 --> 00:46:38.135]  That they were first hacked by Crucifer 2, who is not in the employ of the Russians.
[00:46:38.935 --> 00:46:42.077]  When he put them out, they got no traction, they got no coverage.
[00:46:42.517 --> 00:46:44.419]  He took them to WikiLeaks.
[00:46:44.819 --> 00:46:48.181]  They confirmed their authenticity and they re-released him.
[00:46:48.821 --> 00:46:49.542]  No Russians.
[00:46:50.002 --> 00:46:57.847]  The whole idea that this was done by the Russians is a false narrative by the new McCarthyites, you know, in the Clinton camp.
[00:46:58.887 --> 00:47:11.956]  It is therefore, I think, important to recognize that the mainstream media, particularly the New York Times, is in possession of evidence of extraordinary corruption at the Clinton Foundation.
[00:47:12.636 --> 00:47:17.960]  Things that have happened since Peter Schweitzer wrote his epic book, Clinton Cash.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.701]  So, ongoing criminal conspiracies.
[00:47:21.602 --> 00:47:23.823]  And the media isn't interested in that.
[00:47:23.903 --> 00:47:25.825]  But Mr. Assange, I think, has the goods.
[00:47:26.545 --> 00:47:27.065]  We don't know.
[00:47:27.085 --> 00:47:28.266]  It could be Benghazi.
[00:47:28.326 --> 00:47:31.028]  It could be the Clinton Foundation.
[00:47:31.168 --> 00:47:39.014]  It could be their speeches, their paid speeches, which I think we both know are thinly described bribes.
[00:47:40.095 --> 00:47:43.458]  You know, Bill Clinton announcing that if Hillary's elected, the Clinton Foundation
[00:47:44.278 --> 00:47:47.901]  We'll no longer take contributions from foreign nationals.
[00:47:47.941 --> 00:47:52.504]  That's like the closing the barn door after the horse has escaped.
[00:47:52.804 --> 00:47:54.325]  The Clintons are crony capitalists.
[00:47:54.945 --> 00:47:57.107]  Progressives have figured out they're not progressives.
[00:47:57.487 --> 00:47:58.268]  They're globalists.
[00:47:58.608 --> 00:48:00.770]  They're neocons, but they're not progressives.
[00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:08.155]  And the way they gave it to Bernie Sanders without the Vaseline was true in Mr. Assange's first data dump.
[00:48:08.775 --> 00:48:15.679]  Now, those on the left call us conspiracy theorists when we say that.
[00:48:16.119 --> 00:48:19.621]  That's a catch-all that's supposed to discredit you.
[00:48:19.741 --> 00:48:31.048]  But I submit the idea that Donald Trump and Paul Manafort are traitors to their own country and loyal to Vladimir Putin
[00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:35.511]  Accusing them of treason, now there is a conspiracy theory.
[00:48:35.831 --> 00:48:37.971]  That's the greatest stretch I've ever heard.
[00:48:38.071 --> 00:48:41.752]  As far as I'm concerned, I am a lifelong anti-communist.
[00:48:42.352 --> 00:48:54.375]  I happen to know that Vladimir Putin doesn't like Paul Manafort, in fact dislikes him, because Manafort pressed his client Yanukovych to join the European Union over the objection of the Russians.
[00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:58.402]  Now a final couple of minutes in this segment, Roger.
[00:48:59.022 --> 00:49:00.964]  We had the big Trump speech yesterday.
[00:49:01.204 --> 00:49:05.067]  The media's kind of spinning the narrative that this was a huge apology.
[00:49:05.948 --> 00:49:18.357]  What concerns me about it is you have establishment Republicans praising Trump, the same people that have lost the last two elections, for adopting this kind of conciliatory tone in this speech yesterday.
[00:49:18.397 --> 00:49:23.982]  Do you think this was a deliberate pivot by Trump or is the speech being mischaracterized by the media?
[00:49:24.955 --> 00:49:25.856]  Mischaracterized.
[00:49:25.896 --> 00:49:28.857]  I wish they would focus on the content of the speech.
[00:49:29.258 --> 00:49:39.543]  Trump essentially asserted that he is a leader, that he is committed to a reform agenda, that he is unafraid to take on the two-party duopoly, including those in his own party he disagrees with.
[00:49:40.404 --> 00:49:43.926]  This was the best speech I have heard him give in this election cycle.
[00:49:44.026 --> 00:49:49.609]  It was very well delivered, and I think the words were more significant.
[00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:51.811]  This hyper
[00:49:52.851 --> 00:49:58.453]  Analysis of anything that happens in the Trump campaign doesn't happen in the Clinton campaign.
[00:49:58.973 --> 00:50:18.140]  The fact that she campaigns for a day and then disappears for sight, and then campaigns for a day and disappears for sight because she doesn't have the stamina to stay on her feet for a campaign event, and that she can't do a press conference because she is incapable of, I think both physically incapable of taking the rigors, nor does she have good answers.
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:20.621]  When I see Joel Berenson
[00:50:21.521 --> 00:50:26.423]  On MSNBC saying these questions are beneath contempt and they don't rise to an answer.
[00:50:26.483 --> 00:50:26.963]  No, Joel.
[00:50:27.403 --> 00:50:27.863]  They do.
[00:50:28.163 --> 00:50:30.944]  Your candidate needs to help going up a flight of stairs.
[00:50:31.344 --> 00:50:33.225]  She is on video having seizures.
[00:50:33.565 --> 00:50:38.047]  She is wearing glasses that doctors tell us are related to brain injury.
[00:50:38.407 --> 00:50:43.929]  She had a traveling physician with her at all times and he clearly had an injection at the ready.
[00:50:44.249 --> 00:50:45.029]  Sorry, Joel.
[00:50:45.269 --> 00:50:46.350]  Legitimate questions.
[00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:48.350]  Your candidate is old and tired.
[00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:50.291]  She does not have the stamina.
[00:50:51.091 --> 00:50:53.394]  Or the health to be President of the United States.
[00:50:54.836 --> 00:50:55.597]  Okay, we'll leave it there.
[00:50:55.637 --> 00:50:57.639]  Roger Stone, stonezone.com.
[00:50:58.119 --> 00:51:01.643]  Be sure to have you back on the show with more updates about the Trump campaign.
[00:51:02.124 --> 00:51:08.311]  Final segment of this hour coming up, it's the Alex Jones Show live breaking news at infowars.com.
[00:51:08.351 --> 00:51:08.852]  We'll be back.
[00:51:10.356 --> 00:51:16.519]  Let's talk about Amerigeddon, which is available at Infowarsstore.com exclusively right now for the next week or so.
[00:51:16.799 --> 00:51:19.300]  You get two copies and you get two free films with it.
[00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:21.921]  Yeah, this is an important movie because it's fact-based.
[00:51:22.802 --> 00:51:29.184]  We tell a story about an EMP attack, an electromagnetic pulse attack on America, that shuts down the grid.
[00:51:29.745 --> 00:51:36.148]  And our Congress has warned that if this were to happen, 90% of the American population would die in 12 months.
[00:51:37.248 --> 00:51:41.913]  To quote Henry Kissinger, the only thing standing in the way of a new world order is a strong America.
[00:51:42.554 --> 00:51:50.482]  One of the ways that they can diminish America quickly and severely is to allow for an EMP attack on this country.
[00:51:51.002 --> 00:51:56.768]  And in light of the events and things that are happening, I'm afraid this is a very likely scenario.
[00:51:56.828 --> 00:51:57.849]  So I made a movie about it.
[00:51:57.869 --> 00:52:00.312]  It's an entertaining movie, but it's fact-based.
[00:52:00.852 --> 00:52:07.134]  People are getting the director's cut that is even bigger than what you see in theaters, and so this is the first look director's cut.
[00:52:07.154 --> 00:52:16.857]  You know, Hollywood has tried to diminish the final edit on this thing, but what Alex has available here at his website this week is everything.
[00:52:16.977 --> 00:52:17.938]  The most hardcore version.
[00:52:18.198 --> 00:52:18.338]  Yep.
[00:52:18.898 --> 00:52:24.760]  So this is a great place to acquire the movie and then to show it to your friends and family and even your churches.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:46.376]  That's right, you can get one copy of the film Amerigeddon on DVD at Infowarsstore.com exclusively right now, or get a second copy, two copies for $39.90, and get my first film, America Destroyed by Design, and then one of my latest, most powerful films, Fall of the Republic, that breaks down everything currently happening, free.
[00:52:46.657 --> 00:52:51.961]  Two films free when you purchase two Amerigeddons, and I'm doing that because I want
[00:52:52.441 --> 00:52:54.002]  to get this film out.
[00:52:54.282 --> 00:53:01.887]  Another big thing people can do if you really want to reach a lot of people, get two copies, keep one for your own archive to share, take the other and donate it to the library.
[00:53:02.367 --> 00:53:05.949]  So many people are smart because they've closed all the video stores.
[00:53:05.969 --> 00:53:17.136]  I was reading an article about this in the Wall Street Journal about a year ago, that what's the most popular now at libraries is not the books anymore, but is people going and actually checking out the DVDs, the Blu-rays, all that.
[00:53:17.616 --> 00:53:20.438]  And so that's why you make a donation of this to your library,
[00:53:21.218 --> 00:53:26.061]  You're going to talk about hundreds of people that are going to check that out and watch it.
[00:53:27.563 --> 00:53:28.483]  That is amazing.
[00:53:28.843 --> 00:53:29.364]  All of that.
[00:53:29.424 --> 00:53:45.235]  I can't tell you how many listeners we run into on the street that found this show, not on a local AM or FM station, but over the internet over the years, that somebody gave them a DVD or somebody gave them a card with ForbiddenInformationInfoWars.com or they saw a bumper sticker and it's just exponential.
[00:53:45.335 --> 00:53:45.915]  It's exponential.
[00:53:46.396 --> 00:53:50.299]  I can't imagine where InfoWars will be in a year, two years, three years.
[00:53:51.339 --> 00:53:55.501]  And I just pray to God that I can be humble and focus and make the right decisions with this great responsibility.
[00:53:55.521 --> 00:53:56.781]  But it's not just Alex Jones.
[00:53:57.081 --> 00:53:57.962]  It's what Gary Haven's doing.
[00:53:57.982 --> 00:53:58.882]  It's what Matt Drudge is doing.
[00:53:58.902 --> 00:53:59.922]  It's what WorldNetDaily is doing.
[00:53:59.962 --> 00:54:03.524]  It's what people like Donald Trump are doing.
[00:54:03.944 --> 00:54:07.345]  We all are just choosing to not be with the new world order.
[00:54:21.112 --> 00:54:24.153]  We're back for the final segment of this hour.
[00:54:24.333 --> 00:54:25.894]  Again, going back to the news.
[00:54:26.574 --> 00:54:36.978]  Big mainstream media websites are removing comment sections from their articles because studies have shown that those comments have more impact than the content of the article itself.
[00:54:37.298 --> 00:54:39.059]  They have such contempt!
[00:54:39.659 --> 00:54:49.103]  For their readers, such hatred for free speech that the Daily Beast, Time Magazine and others are coming out and simply saying, we don't welcome your comments anymore.
[00:54:49.323 --> 00:54:51.264]  It's the arrogance that they do it with.
[00:54:51.824 --> 00:54:53.805]  Absolute sneering arrogance.
[00:54:54.145 --> 00:54:58.207]  And in fact we had an article out of Time Magazine yesterday on this very subject.
[00:54:58.587 --> 00:55:00.788]  How trolls are ruining the internet.
[00:55:01.148 --> 00:55:04.230]  They're turning the web into a cesspool of aggression and violence.
[00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:07.711]  What watching them is doing to the rest of us may be even worse.
[00:55:08.051 --> 00:55:22.716]  So again, it's this narrative that people having free expression on the internet is horrible, is aggressive, is violent, is bullying, is intimidating, it's cyber violence, and that we should eliminate it.
[00:55:23.176 --> 00:55:25.117]  Again, they create this hoax.
[00:55:25.757 --> 00:55:32.427]  That the only, quote, trolling, the only hatred, the only bullying on the internet is coming from right-wing conservatives.
[00:55:32.728 --> 00:55:41.040]  Now I can show you the death threats, and I have done, I get every single day from leftists, from Islamists, from Black Lives Matter supporters.
[00:55:41.741 --> 00:55:45.863]  Far greater in volume than anything I've seen from conservatives.
[00:55:45.903 --> 00:55:46.924]  Yes, it does happen.
[00:55:47.424 --> 00:55:55.908]  But to claim that only, quote, right-wing conservatives are sending death threats, are sending abuse on the internet, is a complete hoax.
[00:55:56.428 --> 00:55:59.170]  Absolute documented media hoax.
[00:55:59.830 --> 00:56:01.791]  Just like the Hillary Clinton health hoax.
[00:56:02.212 --> 00:56:05.714]  They took this fake document and then said, oh, this is a fake document.
[00:56:05.754 --> 00:56:09.677]  That means all the questions about Hillary Clinton's health have been debunked.
[00:56:10.037 --> 00:56:11.358]  Well, they haven't been debunked.
[00:56:11.678 --> 00:56:13.740]  You created that media hoax.
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:17.482]  None of us ever cited that fake document as evidence.
[00:56:17.943 --> 00:56:19.624]  So why do they keep on claiming it?
[00:56:19.904 --> 00:56:25.788]  Why does the Clinton campaign hold up this fake document and say, look, everything you said has been debunked?
[00:56:26.329 --> 00:56:28.710]  Again, another massive hoax.
[00:56:29.861 --> 00:56:34.005]  They insult people's intelligence on a daily basis.
[00:56:34.085 --> 00:56:35.466]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:56:35.966 --> 00:56:48.838]  So again, we've got Daily Caller reporting, the Clinton campaign now says they want to basically eliminate, destroy Breitbart, that it doesn't have a right to exist, while the UN is about to take over the internet.
[00:56:49.378 --> 00:56:51.780]  Absolutely chilling development.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:53.482]  Let's hit a few final news stories here.
[00:56:53.962 --> 00:56:56.664]  Jewish man stabbed on street in French city of Strasbourg.
[00:56:57.044 --> 00:57:03.970]  An orthodox Jewish man has been stabbed on the street in the French city of Strasbourg by an attacker reportedly shouting an Islamic slogan.
[00:57:04.431 --> 00:57:12.917]  So you had a Muslim guy shouting Allah Akbar while stabbing a Jewish rabbi who was dressed in orthodox Jewish clothing.
[00:57:13.418 --> 00:57:16.861]  What did the police come out and say within, what, an hour of the attack?
[00:57:17.381 --> 00:57:20.824]  Nothing to do with terrorism, not an anti-Semitic attack.
[00:57:21.504 --> 00:57:28.149]  Okay, you've got a Muslim shouting Alarak Bar, stabbing a Jewish person, and that's not anti-Semitic.
[00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:33.314]  There's a massive cover-up going on with every single one of these attacks in Europe.
[00:57:33.634 --> 00:57:36.196]  We saw it at the football stadium in Germany last year.
[00:57:36.756 --> 00:57:37.878]  Cover up of that attack.
[00:57:38.178 --> 00:57:40.240]  We saw the Russell Square stabbing in London.
[00:57:40.541 --> 00:57:42.042]  Again, clearly a terrorist attack.
[00:57:42.383 --> 00:57:43.804]  Claimed it was mental illness.
[00:57:44.125 --> 00:57:51.153]  This attack in Strasbourg, they claimed within an hour it was mental illness despite all the eyewitness evidence to the contrary.
[00:57:51.533 --> 00:57:55.716]  We had a cover-up of a car bombing in Camden, London just a few weeks ago.
[00:57:56.257 --> 00:58:02.801]  They're covering up these Islamist terror attacks because they want to make the whole narrative about Islamophobia.
[00:58:03.082 --> 00:58:10.427]  Now we've got the BBC saying that merely mentioning or being critical of Sharia law is Islamophobic.
[00:58:10.507 --> 00:58:15.110]  Again, in line with Sally Cohn, CNN, Sharia law is progressive, you know.
[00:58:15.931 --> 00:58:25.100]  Honour killings, forced child marriage, throwing gay people off buildings, stoning women to death, chopping people's hands off if they steal something.
[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:26.821]  That's all under Sharia law?
[00:58:27.142 --> 00:58:32.747]  That's all progressive, according to Sally Cohn, according to CNN, according to the BBC.
[00:58:33.067 --> 00:58:33.568]  It's another
[00:58:33.988 --> 00:58:35.930]  Giant media hoax.
[00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:37.871]  They run them on a daily basis.
[00:58:37.931 --> 00:58:39.472]  But that's going to wrap it up for this hour.
[00:58:39.873 --> 00:58:44.056]  Coming up in the next segment, Leanne McAdoo will take on the rest of the broadcast.
[00:58:44.196 --> 00:58:45.257]  I've been Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:58:45.357 --> 00:58:47.458]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:47.479 --> 00:58:48.059]  Don't go away.
[00:58:50.741 --> 00:58:52.542]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:54.024 --> 00:58:55.985]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:00.268 --> 00:59:02.209]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:02.650]  Poll.
[00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:07.914]  Jill Stein tied with dead gorilla Harambe trailing these nuts in Texas.
[00:59:08.134 --> 00:59:09.235]  Article up by the hill.
[00:59:09.395 --> 00:59:14.398]  Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein is tied with Harambe.
[00:59:14.498 --> 00:59:19.422]  The gorilla killed in a Cincinnati zoo in May in a new poll of Texas voters.
[00:59:19.622 --> 00:59:25.904]  Public Policy Polling released a survey on Tuesday which showed only 2% would vote for Stein.
[00:59:25.985 --> 00:59:28.405]  The same percentage that support Harambe.
[00:59:28.526 --> 00:59:33.227]  This is the second time PPP has polled support for the dead gorilla.
[00:59:33.387 --> 00:59:40.330]  At the end of July, PPP tweeted the results of a poll that had Stein at 2% support and Harambe at 5%.
[00:59:41.131 --> 00:59:44.692]  Tuesday's polls also have Stein trailing these nuts.
[00:59:44.912 --> 00:59:48.816]  The fictitional politician who has the support of 3% of voters.
[00:59:48.996 --> 00:59:56.465]  These nuts who filed with the Federal Election Commission to run for president in 2016 is a 15-year-old Iowan Brady Olson.
[00:59:56.585 --> 00:59:59.568]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[01:00:02.111 --> 01:00:04.714]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:25.031 --> 01:00:26.552]  We are on the march.
[01:00:26.952 --> 01:00:29.314]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:00:30.114 --> 01:00:33.837]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:42.128 --> 01:00:44.589]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:44.769 --> 01:00:49.651]  I am Leanne McAdoo taking over the big boy chair for the remainder of the afternoon.
[01:00:50.111 --> 01:00:52.432]  We have got a jam-packed show for you.
[01:00:53.012 --> 01:00:56.914]  Joining us in the next hour, we're going to have the investigative journalist Wayne Madsen joining us.
[01:00:56.934 --> 01:01:02.316]  He's going to break down his latest report detailing the Clinton Foundation donations.
[01:01:02.896 --> 01:01:06.558]  And how, of course, they've been linked to State Department favors.
[01:01:07.078 --> 01:01:09.620]  Now, we don't really need anyone to spell this out for us.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:11.061]  We know this is already happening.
[01:01:11.521 --> 01:01:12.862]  But thank you, Wayne Madsen.
[01:01:12.882 --> 01:01:14.183]  We're going to get into the details.
[01:01:14.823 --> 01:01:20.066]  We're also going to take a look at how George Soros is behind the Muslim takeover of the West.
[01:01:20.606 --> 01:01:24.288]  We'll also be speaking with political cartoonist Ben Garrison.
[01:01:24.849 --> 01:01:29.972]  I want to get his opinion on how censorship and this political correct culture is basically
[01:01:30.732 --> 01:01:34.495]  Infiltrating every single corridor that we are seeing in our country.
[01:01:34.515 --> 01:01:37.977]  And, you know, he dares to go where no one else goes.
[01:01:38.117 --> 01:01:43.341]  Talking about Hillary's health and how we're having to prop her up like Weekend at Bernie's.
[01:01:43.901 --> 01:01:47.864]  We're also going to get into the latest on reports that the U.S.
[01:01:47.924 --> 01:01:50.205]  is moving nukes closer to the Ukraine.
[01:01:50.305 --> 01:01:53.888]  Alex Jones has a special report giving us the latest details.
[01:01:54.648 --> 01:02:00.611]  Joe Biggs will also be joining me in studio to talk about Trump's epic speech.
[01:02:00.871 --> 01:02:04.512]  This is an epic speech that has the globalists shaking in their boots.
[01:02:04.572 --> 01:02:08.314]  They have no idea how to deal with a Trump who has now pivoted.
[01:02:08.974 --> 01:02:15.437]  He's come out and basically apologized for maybe offending anyone, but saying, look, I'm going to be honest.
[01:02:15.617 --> 01:02:16.557]  I'm an honest person.
[01:02:16.917 --> 01:02:18.098]  I'm not a politician.
[01:02:18.758 --> 01:02:22.560]  And that's what you're going to get with me is a president who is going to
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:24.101]  Tell you the truth.
[01:02:24.281 --> 01:02:25.102]  Tell you like it is.
[01:02:25.202 --> 01:02:26.384]  It might not always be pretty.
[01:02:26.904 --> 01:02:35.093]  And frankly, I would take that any day over a president who has been lying to us, laughing at us.
[01:02:35.514 --> 01:02:37.076]  He's very snarky and he...
[01:02:38.337 --> 01:02:40.958]  Calls out the press and is lecturing them.
[01:02:41.038 --> 01:02:42.679]  How dare you question me?
[01:02:42.699 --> 01:02:46.620]  I didn't pay a ransom for our Americans, for Iran.
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:49.421]  And then turns out, yes, indeed, he did pay a ransom.
[01:02:49.821 --> 01:02:50.881]  Trump was right on that.
[01:02:51.002 --> 01:03:01.625]  Once again, even though the the press who was being lectured by Obama went after Donald Trump and telling him what a fool he was for daring to question his holiness, President Obama.
[01:03:02.025 --> 01:03:03.226]  And of course, now people are
[01:03:03.786 --> 01:03:11.029]  Being led right to the slaughter again with Hillary Clinton, who has lied under oath, been caught lying under oath.
[01:03:11.089 --> 01:03:22.415]  She basically had FBI Director James Comey almost throwing up in his mouth while he was detailing all of her lies that she said under oath and then had to
[01:03:23.075 --> 01:03:26.838]  Had to kind of say at the end there, well, we're not going to go ahead and pursue charges against her.
[01:03:27.258 --> 01:03:35.304]  But now we are hoping that the GOP is going to be bold and pursue some perjury charges against Hillary Clinton.
[01:03:35.344 --> 01:03:39.327]  But you know, I really appreciate where Donald Trump went with his speech.
[01:03:39.647 --> 01:03:44.291]  He's very positive, very inclusive, and I like this pivot.
[01:03:44.411 --> 01:03:45.372]  I like what he's done.
[01:03:46.172 --> 01:03:46.352]  I don't
[01:04:03.932 --> 01:04:04.332]  We're good.
[01:04:21.966 --> 01:04:23.767]  Destroy them at their own game.
[01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:26.348]  He's going to be a champion of the people.
[01:04:26.809 --> 01:04:29.010]  He is going to be put America first.
[01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:30.811]  That's what he said in his speech.
[01:04:30.911 --> 01:04:32.892]  You know, let our children be dreamers, too.
[01:04:33.492 --> 01:04:35.994]  But we're going to have more on that coming up later in the show.
[01:04:36.074 --> 01:04:40.316]  But right after the break, you're going to be hearing a very special report from Alex Jones.
[01:04:40.816 --> 01:04:43.878]  He wants to give you the truth because you're not going to hear it from the mainstream media.
[01:04:43.898 --> 01:04:48.801]  You're just going to hear the Pentagon denying the fact that the U.S.
[01:04:48.841 --> 01:04:50.422]  is moving nukes closer to the Ukraine.
[01:04:50.942 --> 01:04:52.144]  But we need to get the truth.
[01:04:52.304 --> 01:04:56.468]  And so Alex Jones is going to be giving us all of the latest details.
[01:04:57.409 --> 01:04:59.632]  It's no open propaganda channel here, folks.
[01:04:59.672 --> 01:05:00.873]  You're only going to get the truth.
[01:05:00.993 --> 01:05:01.954]  So we'll be right back.
[01:05:02.014 --> 01:05:02.535]  Stick around.
[01:05:10.718 --> 01:05:16.862]  Let's talk about American, which is available at Infowarsstore.com exclusively right now for the next week or so.
[01:05:17.142 --> 01:05:19.623]  You get two copies and you get two free films with it.
[01:05:19.723 --> 01:05:22.986]  Yeah, this is an important movie because it's fact-based.
[01:05:23.146 --> 01:05:29.530]  We tell a story about an EMP attack, an electromagnetic pulse attack on America that shuts down the grid.
[01:05:30.090 --> 01:05:36.494]  And our Congress has warned that if this were to happen, 90% of the American population would die in 12 months.
[01:05:37.595 --> 01:05:42.239]  To quote Henry Kissinger, the only thing standing in the way of a new world order is a strong America.
[01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:50.807]  One of the ways that they can diminish America quickly and severely is to allow for an EMP attack on this country.
[01:05:51.327 --> 01:05:57.093]  And in light of the events and things that are happening, I'm afraid this is a very likely scenario.
[01:05:57.213 --> 01:05:58.174]  So I made a movie about it.
[01:05:58.194 --> 01:06:00.656]  It's an entertaining movie, but it's fact-based.
[01:06:01.176 --> 01:06:07.459]  People are getting the director's cut that is even bigger than what you see in theaters, and so this is the first look director's cut.
[01:06:07.479 --> 01:06:17.204]  You know, Hollywood has tried to diminish the final edit on this thing, but what Alex has available here at his website this week is everything.
[01:06:17.324 --> 01:06:18.325]  The most hardcore version.
[01:06:18.345 --> 01:06:18.545]  Yep.
[01:06:19.245 --> 01:06:25.127]  So, uh, this is a great place to acquire the movie and to, and then to show it to your friends and family and even your churches.
[01:06:25.307 --> 01:06:25.667]  That's right.
[01:06:25.687 --> 01:06:35.170]  You can get one copy of the film Amerageddon on DVD at InfowarsStore.com exclusively right now or get a second copy, uh, two copies for $39.90 and get my
[01:06:37.091 --> 01:06:37.391]  We're good.
[01:06:57.592 --> 01:07:02.215]  Get two copies, keep one for your own archive to share, take the other and donate it to the library.
[01:07:02.715 --> 01:07:06.297]  So many people are smart because they've closed all the video stores.
[01:07:06.317 --> 01:07:17.484]  I was reading an article about this in the Wall Street Journal about a year ago, that what's the most popular now at libraries is not the books anymore, but is people going and actually checking out the DVDs, the Blu-rays, all that.
[01:07:17.964 --> 01:07:26.389]  And so that's why you make a donation of this to your library, you're going to talk about hundreds of people that are going to check that out and watch it.
[01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:28.811]  That is amazing.
[01:07:29.191 --> 01:07:29.711]  All of that.
[01:07:29.751 --> 01:07:45.560]  I can't tell you how many listeners we run into on the street that found this show, not on a local M or FM station, but over the internet over the years, that somebody gave them a DVD or somebody gave them a card with forbidden information, InfoWars.com, or they saw a bumper sticker, and it's just exponential.
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:46.240]  It's exponential.
[01:07:46.721 --> 01:07:50.643]  I can't imagine where InfoWars will be in a year, two years, three years.
[01:07:51.684 --> 01:07:55.850]  And I just pray to God that I can be humble and focused and make the right decisions with this great responsibility.
[01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:57.132]  But it's not just Alex Jones.
[01:07:57.432 --> 01:07:58.313]  It's what Gary Haven's doing.
[01:07:58.333 --> 01:07:59.194]  It's what Matt Drudge is doing.
[01:07:59.214 --> 01:08:00.276]  It's what WorldNetDaily is doing.
[01:08:00.316 --> 01:08:03.881]  It's what people like Donald Trump are doing.
[01:08:04.302 --> 01:08:07.687]  We all are just choosing to not be with the new world order.
[01:08:24.697 --> 01:08:34.642]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:08:35.363 --> 01:08:44.868]  I cannot help asking those who have caused this situation, do you realize now what you've done?
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:59.242]  We even know year by year what's going to happen.
[01:08:59.542 --> 01:09:00.622]  And they know we know.
[01:09:00.943 --> 01:09:05.665]  It's only you that they tell these fables and you buy it and spread it to the citizens of your countries.
[01:09:06.106 --> 01:09:09.668]  And your people do not feel a sense of the impending danger.
[01:09:11.649 --> 01:09:12.770]  This is what worries me.
[01:09:13.610 --> 01:09:17.733]  How do you not understand that the world is being pulled in an irreversible direction?
[01:09:19.514 --> 01:09:20.455]  That is the problem.
[01:09:21.135 --> 01:09:23.036]  But they pretend like nothing's going on.
[01:09:23.797 --> 01:09:25.818]  I don't even know how to get through to you people anymore.
[01:09:27.774 --> 01:09:39.417]  Putin will try to destabilize Ukraine, but the Ukrainians, the large majority of Ukrainians, are determined to be independent of Russia.
[01:09:39.757 --> 01:09:42.378]  Well then, why are you interfering in our business?
[01:09:42.778 --> 01:09:44.019]  Don't meddle in our business.
[01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:46.099]  Sort out your own issues first.
[01:09:46.479 --> 01:09:51.461]  Mr. Trump declared that he's ready to restore full cooperative relations with Russia.
[01:09:52.161 --> 01:09:53.601]  What's so bad about that?
[01:09:54.061 --> 01:09:54.942]  We all welcome that.
[01:09:55.242 --> 01:09:56.062]  Do you not?
[01:10:06.505 --> 01:10:24.831]  In recent years, we have seen a cacophony of geopolitical experts, historians, statisticians, statesmen come out and warn that the world
[01:10:26.095 --> 01:10:32.056]  is hurtling towards major military conflict between the United States and Russia.
[01:10:32.816 --> 01:10:40.218]  And that the climate that we see in the world today is very similar to what we saw before World War I and World War II.
[01:10:41.898 --> 01:10:50.660]  Vladimir Putin has come out multiple times in the last six months at press conferences and warned the world
[01:10:51.462 --> 01:10:58.608]  That the West, under the guise of missile defense systems, is moving offensive nuclear weapons up to the border with Russia.
[01:11:00.549 --> 01:11:01.350]  I study the facts.
[01:11:02.671 --> 01:11:05.734]  I know that two years ago George Soros bragged on CNN.
[01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:12.934]  That he had the major part with the State Department in overthrowing the elected government of Ukraine.
[01:11:13.915 --> 01:11:28.987]  First on Ukraine, one of the things that many people recognize about you was that you, during the revolutions of 1989, funded a lot of dissident activities, civil society groups in Eastern Europe, in Poland, the Czech Republic.
[01:11:29.667 --> 01:11:31.529]  Are you doing similar things in Ukraine?
[01:11:31.989 --> 01:11:39.615]  Well, I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent of Russia.
[01:11:40.856 --> 01:11:44.700]  And the foundation has been functioning ever since.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:49.143]  And it played an important part in events now.
[01:11:49.744 --> 01:11:57.871]  Now, in the eastern area of Ukraine that has always been part of Russia, the Crimea, it means the border in Russian,
[01:11:59.022 --> 01:12:03.303]  We have proxy armies of NATO battling Russian troops.
[01:12:04.184 --> 01:12:06.485]  And the Russian losses have been high.
[01:12:07.305 --> 01:12:15.988]  Just last week, Vladimir Putin came out in a press conference and pointed out that Kiev is launching basically asymmetrical attacks, or what he called terrorism.
[01:12:17.048 --> 01:12:25.131]  And whether you support Russia or Putin or don't, or whether you're just neutral, it should be a major news item here in the United States.
[01:12:25.951 --> 01:12:27.712]  Here's a segment of that news conference.
[01:12:28.894 --> 01:12:41.525]  It is true that our special forces have foiled an attempt by a group of sabotage infiltrators belonging to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's intelligence agency, who were seeking to penetrate the Crimean territory.
[01:12:41.545 --> 01:12:50.513]  And in view of these events, it has become pointless to meet with the Ukraine's current authorities at the Normandy format.
[01:12:51.673 --> 01:12:54.395]  We have suffered losses as a result of this operation.
[01:12:55.155 --> 01:12:59.338]  We undoubtedly cannot turn a blind eye to the deaths of our servicemen.
[01:12:59.898 --> 01:13:02.780]  But I would also like to address our American and European partners.
[01:13:04.971 --> 01:13:15.393]  I think today it has become obvious for everyone that Kiev's current authorities are not seeking ways to solve problems through negotiations, but have turned to terrorism instead.
[01:13:15.413 --> 01:13:19.514]  This is a highly troubling development.
[01:13:19.814 --> 01:13:30.496]  There are no other reasons for conducting such actions other than to distract the Ukrainian people and divert their attention from the disastrous economic situation
[01:13:31.269 --> 01:13:34.992]  And the miserable conditions most of them are living in.
[01:13:36.093 --> 01:13:43.279]  And here we are, two years after George Soros and the State Department brag that they overthrew the elected government of Ukraine.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:59.913]  And now as NATO and Western forces mass on the Russian border, and as Russia puts 40,000 troops on its border and goes on high alert, and as Putin says, no more detente, no more talk with Ukraine, you are attacking Russian citizens in your east.
[01:14:01.246 --> 01:14:10.513]  Zero coverage here in our media unless there's stories saying that I'm a Russian agent or that InfoWars or Donald Trump have sold out to Putin.
[01:14:11.473 --> 01:14:15.976]  No, we've sold out to common sense and decency and not having a nuclear war.
[01:14:15.996 --> 01:14:26.324]  And I see the emails that come in and the comments on InfoWars by a vocal minority saying that I'm a fear monger because I'm concerned about global conflict.
[01:14:27.947 --> 01:14:32.690]  Yes, I'm concerned about the West funding Al Qaeda and ISIS to take over the Middle East and North Africa.
[01:14:33.450 --> 01:14:42.155]  I'm upset about our governments creating thousands of trillions of dollars of fake derivatives to buy up the world.
[01:14:43.096 --> 01:14:48.599]  I'm concerned about the Clinton Foundation taking money from third world dictators and Middle Eastern
[01:14:50.188 --> 01:14:52.228]  Governments that oppress women and homosexuals.
[01:14:52.889 --> 01:14:55.949]  I'm concerned about the laissez-faire attitude of our elites.
[01:14:56.849 --> 01:15:00.430]  But I'm even more concerned about the general population.
[01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:07.532]  Because I've had people that I know personally say to me, Alex, we've been hearing about nuclear war since the 1960s.
[01:15:08.452 --> 01:15:09.492]  It's fear-mongering.
[01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:11.132]  It's never going to happen.
[01:15:12.032 --> 01:15:14.493]  And the New York Times makes jokes about fear porn.
[01:15:16.254 --> 01:15:20.796]  We have the power to destroy life on this planet many times over.
[01:15:22.057 --> 01:15:27.600]  We have promethean fire that will either take us to the stars or turn this whole planet into a giant tombstone.
[01:15:28.732 --> 01:15:29.533]  I have three children.
[01:15:30.313 --> 01:15:31.554]  I study geopolitics.
[01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:33.936]  I'm involved in trying to build a better world.
[01:15:34.496 --> 01:15:36.397]  I want peace with Russia and China.
[01:15:37.038 --> 01:15:37.718]  I don't want war.
[01:15:38.298 --> 01:15:49.466]  And I see our very elites that tell us don't worry about war being the ones that gave nuclear reactors to North Korea so they could create atomic bombs, and who gave the missile secrets for ICBMs
[01:15:50.526 --> 01:15:52.328]  To China in the 1990s.
[01:15:53.009 --> 01:16:01.137]  The very people telling us don't worry about all this are the very ones that are pushing our world towards the brink of extinction.
[01:16:02.118 --> 01:16:03.159]  And not just for humanity.
[01:16:03.979 --> 01:16:08.244]  We've seen The Hague recently rule against the Chinese in the South China Sea.
[01:16:08.924 --> 01:16:14.290]  And we've seen China go into a very belligerent tone, threatening war with the world.
[01:16:15.555 --> 01:16:36.603]  Whether you support the Communist Chinese or don't, I'm sitting here as an American patriot pointing out that we have aircraft carriers and fleets openly lined up against Chinese ships in the South China Sea in the last two months with the People's Daily and the President of China saying war with the United States is imminent!
[01:16:39.966 --> 01:16:49.898]  And there's a thousand times more news, literally, about some American athlete in South America at the Olympics who might have lied about being robbed.
[01:16:50.579 --> 01:16:52.842]  That's the big story and not this.
[01:16:53.703 --> 01:16:57.868]  World Net Daily is reporting that six plus trillion dollars is missing from the Pentagon.
[01:16:58.916 --> 01:17:03.838]  The last time CBS News reported the day before 9-11 that $2 trillion was missing, you saw what happened.
[01:17:04.098 --> 01:17:06.079]  And that's just the beginning of what I'm talking about.
[01:17:06.299 --> 01:17:11.361]  The elite is all basically running to armored fortresses and redoubts in New Zealand.
[01:17:11.381 --> 01:17:12.442]  They're going underground.
[01:17:12.482 --> 01:17:13.062]  It's admitted.
[01:17:13.082 --> 01:17:17.764]  They're building huge walls from Hillary's palace to Zuckerberg's around their houses.
[01:17:18.424 --> 01:17:22.046]  They're acting like it's the end of the world while telling us don't worry about it.
[01:17:22.586 --> 01:17:23.726]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[01:17:23.926 --> 01:17:27.288]  If you even talk about Putin, discussing nuclear war.
[01:17:29.036 --> 01:17:39.503]  These are crazy times to be alive, and I'm simply here ringing the alarm bell saying, we've gotten by without a nuclear war so far, and we're very close to one right now.
[01:17:40.383 --> 01:17:47.048]  Let's have a debate about this instead of whether or not somebody on the Olympic team lied about being assaulted.
[01:17:48.109 --> 01:17:50.250]  Let's force real issues out there in the open.
[01:17:51.591 --> 01:17:57.575]  I'm Alex Jones, asking all of you to think about the facts, to weigh the evidence,
[01:17:59.025 --> 01:18:03.528]  And to decide, is having 50,000 nuclear weapons on this planet safe?
[01:18:05.689 --> 01:18:07.830]  Is massing troops on the Russian border a good idea?
[01:18:09.151 --> 01:18:11.452]  Is funding ISIS and Al-Qaeda a good idea?
[01:18:14.414 --> 01:18:19.077]  The decision is up to all of us, and we should have a serious debate about it.
[01:18:19.597 --> 01:18:21.298]  The globalists don't want that debate to happen.
[01:18:22.196 --> 01:18:32.600]  We're here to force that debate front and center, just like we've done about election fraud, just like we've done about GMO, just like we've done about our government funding ISIS on every front.
[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:41.563]  InfoWars is the tip of the spear because we have 28 million viewers and listeners, just like you, that are awake and who are involved.
[01:18:43.483 --> 01:18:48.245]  So my friends, it's time to take action and to stop a new world war.
[01:18:53.032 --> 01:18:55.713]  And there we have it, Alex Jones with the key intel.
[01:18:55.773 --> 01:19:00.596]  Now we know we just cannot trust the establishment media to give us the facts of what's going on.
[01:19:00.636 --> 01:19:06.679]  They want to distract us with what color a swimmer's hair turned when it was there in the pool at the Olympics.
[01:19:07.099 --> 01:19:13.622]  Total propaganda channels and just diverting our attention from the fact that if these nukes are put there on the border,
[01:19:14.182 --> 01:19:18.046]  A recent report warned that ISIS could steal the nukes in Turkey.
[01:19:18.387 --> 01:19:22.892]  This is absolutely insanity, but the establishment wants that boogeyman.
[01:19:22.992 --> 01:19:30.620]  We've got to have, you know, Russian boogeyman there so they can continue to control people and use that fear factor whenever they're needing it.
[01:19:30.981 --> 01:19:32.542]  Now we are going to be speaking with
[01:19:33.383 --> 01:19:37.904]  Political activist, cartoonist Ben Garrison coming up right after the break.
[01:19:38.624 --> 01:19:46.486]  He's one of the few people out there who is working actively to take out Hillary Clinton and her health.
[01:19:46.646 --> 01:19:53.587]  You know, the mainstream media doesn't want to talk about it, but that's just one way you can easily share these cartoons on Facebook, on Twitter.
[01:19:54.208 --> 01:19:55.608]  Get this information out there.
[01:19:55.988 --> 01:19:58.989]  All the breaking news is at InfoWars.com.
[01:19:59.049 --> 01:20:00.169]  Stick around, we'll be right back.
[01:20:10.265 --> 01:20:10.725]  We're not a group.
[01:20:10.785 --> 01:20:12.186]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:20:12.226 --> 01:20:13.306]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:20:13.567 --> 01:20:14.487]  Why is this so good?
[01:20:14.767 --> 01:20:20.010]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:33.636]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:20:33.696 --> 01:20:35.077]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:37.419]  Spreading disease around.
[01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:40.001]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:20:40.101 --> 01:20:41.362]  These are all parasites.
[01:20:41.402 --> 01:20:42.503]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:20:42.523 --> 01:20:43.544]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:20:43.864 --> 01:20:50.470]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood, you have enzyme blend in there.
[01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:58.457]  This is very important because a lot of these microorganisms and even going up to tapeworms, pinworms, you have to disintegrate the lining.
[01:20:58.477 --> 01:20:59.718]  I mean on viruses are pretty
[01:20:59.838 --> 01:21:00.238]  We're good to
[01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:40.403]  I mean, I think a lot of the information that we put out there and a lot of the products that we develop are specifically for that reason, to protect you against the endocrine disrupting chemicals, to protect you against all those chemicals and toxins.
[01:21:40.623 --> 01:21:51.505]  So we actually design the living defense and put in a specific blend of enzymes which actually chew and eat through the lining of these different organisms.
[01:21:52.125 --> 01:21:53.746]  So the Living Defense is amazing.
[01:21:54.166 --> 01:21:56.246]  We've seen just tremendous reviews.
[01:21:56.907 --> 01:21:59.067]  How often should you take Living Defense?
[01:21:59.148 --> 01:22:00.468]  I mean, is it a regimen every day?
[01:22:00.508 --> 01:22:02.329]  That's what I was doing until we ran out.
[01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:04.389]  Or do you do it heavier for certain cleanses?
[01:22:04.409 --> 01:22:05.250]  What do you do, Dr. Group?
[01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:17.474]  Well, I do usually six weeks at a time, because if you look at the life cycle of most parasites, it's six weeks from the time... So you've got to kill the ones that are in there and then kill their babies when the eggs hatch up.
[01:22:17.794 --> 01:22:32.407]  If you're suffering from abdominal pain, allergies, even like headaches, anemia, weakened immune system, gut problems, depression, hair loss, excess gas, muscle pain, nervousness, I mean all these things.
[01:22:32.447 --> 01:22:39.534]  If you look at some of these conditions and then us opening up our borders and all the other countries opening up their borders.
[01:22:40.074 --> 01:22:50.522]  You're just dealing with a mass amount of parasites or harmful organisms or biological weapons that are spreading and mutating all across the world.
[01:22:50.542 --> 01:22:54.665]  And I think that's one of the reasons why, I mean, all you have to do is look at the news these days.
[01:22:55.265 --> 01:22:57.687]  You can type in refugees spreading disease.
[01:22:57.727 --> 01:23:00.028]  I mean the CDC is going crazy right now.
[01:23:00.649 --> 01:23:05.072]  There's a new antibiotic resistant E. coli that they just identified.
[01:23:05.172 --> 01:23:06.273]  Doctors don't know.
[01:23:06.373 --> 01:23:09.995]  They don't teach doctors in medical school about parasites and harmful organisms.
[01:23:10.035 --> 01:23:12.157]  There's a reason why they don't teach them about that.
[01:23:12.237 --> 01:23:15.479]  Just like they don't teach doctors about the root cause of disease.
[01:23:15.959 --> 01:23:18.220]  And how to eliminate all disease out there.
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:19.640]  They don't want you to know about it.
[01:23:19.921 --> 01:23:22.622]  You don't want your own immune system being attacked.
[01:23:22.882 --> 01:23:26.263]  Again, you have animals, especially your cats, dogs.
[01:23:26.303 --> 01:23:28.164]  So many people have pets these days.
[01:23:28.624 --> 01:23:30.044]  People eat raw sushi.
[01:23:30.445 --> 01:23:32.085]  People eat more raw food.
[01:23:32.105 --> 01:23:36.287]  You have all these different organisms showing up in the water supplies now.
[01:23:36.827 --> 01:23:40.148]  You even have it in the air supplies, these tiny microorganisms.
[01:23:40.188 --> 01:23:43.009]  So it's not like we can get away from them.
[01:23:43.069 --> 01:23:44.550]  We just have to do everything.
[01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:48.231]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:23:48.251 --> 01:23:48.631]  All right.
[01:23:48.692 --> 01:23:51.533]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:23:51.553 --> 01:23:52.533]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:23:52.593 --> 01:23:53.113]  Living Defense.
[01:23:53.413 --> 01:23:54.474]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:23:54.534 --> 01:23:55.554]  And folks, you can't lose.

[01:23:58.275 --> 01:24:00.176]  And you support the broadcast.
[01:24:00.216 --> 01:24:01.296]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:24:01.556 --> 01:24:03.437]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:24:03.817 --> 01:24:05.778]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:24:26.572 --> 01:24:28.752]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:28.872 --> 01:24:32.534]  I am Leanne McAdoo here with you for the remainder of the show.
[01:24:33.054 --> 01:24:37.835]  Now, before the break, we heard a really hard-hitting report from Alex Jones.
[01:24:38.336 --> 01:24:40.536]  This is the kind of truthful information that you're going to get here.
[01:24:40.576 --> 01:24:42.517]  You're not going to find it anywhere else.
[01:24:42.897 --> 01:24:50.920]  And we are able to bring you those hard-hitting reports, bringing you in the big guests who dare to go against that mainstream narrative.
[01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:54.585]  We're able to do that because of the support of our listeners.

[01:25:51.019 --> 01:25:53.299]  This is another one of our high-quality products.
[01:25:53.319 --> 01:25:55.160]  We have a lot of great reviews.
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:57.061]  What is that?
[01:25:57.081 --> 01:26:01.002]  4.8 stars from our reviews on this high-quality product.
[01:26:01.663 --> 01:26:05.004]  Now, we're going to shift gears and go to our guest.
[01:26:05.604 --> 01:26:06.705]  This is Ben Garrison.
[01:26:06.785 --> 01:26:09.526]  He is a political activist cartoonist.
[01:26:10.226 --> 01:26:14.268]  He's a commercial artist, fine artist, and a libertarian cartoonist.
[01:26:14.628 --> 01:26:22.092]  Now, he says he was very angry after the 2008 banker bailout, so he decided to draw protest cartoons in his spare time.
[01:26:22.413 --> 01:26:27.155]  He began by drawing anti-Federal Reserve and pro-Ron Paul cartoons.
[01:26:27.195 --> 01:26:28.456]  You've seen his work.
[01:26:28.496 --> 01:26:31.597]  He has very iconic anti-New World Order artwork.
[01:26:31.958 --> 01:26:36.780]  But now it seems like, Mr. Garrison, you're dead set on taking out Hillary Clinton.
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:38.081]  Welcome to the show.
[01:26:39.226 --> 01:26:40.627]  Thanks for having me.
[01:26:40.747 --> 01:27:01.478]  Normally I'd be drawing a lot more anti-Federal Reserve cartoons, anti-big government, anti-forced vaccination and things such as that, but right now it's imperative that we keep this creature from returning to the White House because if she gets it back in there now, I mean, who knows what kind of junk she'll pull on the American people.
[01:27:01.538 --> 01:27:05.200]  I mean, she could end up doing some stuff that would make Hitler and Stalin blush.
[01:27:06.573 --> 01:27:13.736]  Right, and you know there's kind of a tenet in journalism, when you're chasing a story, if everybody zigs, you zag.
[01:27:14.057 --> 01:27:23.401]  And so it appears like that's exactly what you're doing with your artwork, because a lot of people would probably go after what they perceive as the low-hanging fruit, which would be Donald Trump.
[01:27:23.461 --> 01:27:30.985]  And we're seeing a lot of this artwork making fun of him, oh he's naked, statues are being put up in New York, and things like that.
[01:27:31.745 --> 01:27:36.068]  But you're going after the topics that the media doesn't want to talk about.
[01:27:36.148 --> 01:27:38.889]  Hillary's health, how the election was rigged.
[01:27:39.610 --> 01:27:50.877]  Let's first just get into one of your latest cartoons, Weekend at Hillary, where you're basically showing how she is having to be propped up and dragged into this election.
[01:27:52.452 --> 01:27:54.153]  Well, this cartoon is factual.
[01:27:54.213 --> 01:27:56.113]  It's not that much of an exaggeration.
[01:27:56.193 --> 01:27:58.114]  I mean, we've already seen it with our own eyes.
[01:27:59.635 --> 01:28:05.437]  Some doctors out there are even starting to say that she has the early onset of dementia.
[01:28:06.217 --> 01:28:11.619]  Well, we've known for a long time that she's already had severe dementia when it comes to ethics.
[01:28:11.659 --> 01:28:12.939]  She's got ethics dementia.
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:16.221]  So, I drew this cartoon to
[01:28:18.436 --> 01:28:21.440]  That's more of an illustration rather than just a fact to me.
[01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:23.482]  I mean, just look at her.
[01:28:23.522 --> 01:28:24.904]  She can hardly go up the stairs.
[01:28:25.205 --> 01:28:29.971]  She's got to be propped up on pillows.
[01:28:30.071 --> 01:28:31.012]  She's got her stool.
[01:28:34.201 --> 01:28:36.283]  So now she's taking the weekend off.
[01:28:36.323 --> 01:28:44.393]  She's taking the weekend off and Obama's golfing while Trump is going down to Louisiana to help out the flood victims.
[01:28:44.593 --> 01:28:45.314]  What does that tell you?
[01:28:46.095 --> 01:28:46.635]  Exactly.
[01:28:46.815 --> 01:28:52.422]  And in fact, they've even said that they don't really want President Obama coming to visit them in Louisiana just yet because
[01:28:52.922 --> 01:28:55.164]  He takes so much preparation.
[01:28:55.224 --> 01:28:58.967]  He would take all of the police that are there trying to help the families in need.
[01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:00.668]  They would have to go protect him.
[01:29:00.728 --> 01:29:01.909]  So they're like, don't even come.
[01:29:01.949 --> 01:29:02.990]  We don't need you right now.
[01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:17.401]  And I love how with this with this cartoon, the points that you're making is that Hillary, without the DNC, without the mainstream media, without all of her handlers, her presidential run would have expired.
[01:29:19.198 --> 01:29:19.958]  It should have expired.
[01:29:20.778 --> 01:29:24.159]  She's unfit in so many ways, in multi-dimensional ways.
[01:29:24.559 --> 01:29:26.099]  She's not fit physically.
[01:29:26.179 --> 01:29:31.521]  She's not fit... When you look at her track record, it's been a series of disasters.
[01:29:32.361 --> 01:29:34.361]  And she's not fit ethically.
[01:29:34.721 --> 01:29:41.143]  She has a long, long history of bamboozling and...
[01:29:43.851 --> 01:29:47.632]  Yeah, you're never going to run out of material when it comes to Hillary Clinton.
[01:29:47.672 --> 01:29:49.333]  We'll be right back with our guest, Ben Garrison.
[01:30:10.183 --> 01:30:11.184]  BrainForce is here.
[01:30:11.725 --> 01:30:13.987]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:30:14.267 --> 01:30:22.114]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:30:22.895 --> 01:30:26.458]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[01:30:26.478 --> 01:30:28.820]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[01:30:29.181 --> 01:30:32.704]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[01:30:32.744 --> 01:30:35.867]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[01:30:36.367 --> 01:30:41.153]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[01:30:41.694 --> 01:30:43.536]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[01:30:43.897 --> 01:30:48.322]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[01:30:48.483 --> 01:30:50.485]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[01:30:51.126 --> 01:30:52.568]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[01:30:52.728 --> 01:30:52.968]  Exactly.
[01:30:52.988 --> 01:30:56.792]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[01:30:57.292 --> 01:31:04.558]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:31:10.006 --> 01:31:11.767]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[01:31:11.948 --> 01:31:12.988]  Trump spokeswoman.
[01:31:13.068 --> 01:31:15.010]  Hillary health questions must be answered.
[01:31:15.130 --> 01:31:16.851]  Why doesn't she have a press conference?
[01:31:17.032 --> 01:31:18.673]  Article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:31:18.793 --> 01:31:29.081]  Donald Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pearson told MSNBC Tuesday that questions surrounding Hillary Clinton's health must be addressed, including why Hillary is taking so much time off.
[01:31:29.321 --> 01:31:35.664]  Pearson drew attention to Hillary's strange behavior and mannerisms that were featured in our viral video.
[01:31:35.864 --> 01:31:50.812]  In addition to her documented health problems as a result of her fall in 2012, the host then claimed that the whole issue had been debunked because of a fake document cited by the Clinton campaign, which none of the commentators asking questions about Hillary's health have been used as evidence.
[01:31:51.072 --> 01:31:58.036]  In addition, because Hillary's personal physician says she is in good health, that's apparently an impartial source according to MSNBC.
[01:31:58.416 --> 01:31:59.638]  Americans are less convinced.
[01:31:59.958 --> 01:32:09.169]  A recent Rasmussen poll found that 59% of them want Hillary to release her full medical records just as the media pressured John McCain back in 2008.
[01:32:09.850 --> 01:32:15.958]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:32:18.379 --> 01:32:24.780]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:31.182]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:32:31.322 --> 01:32:34.463]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:32:34.603 --> 01:32:36.043]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:32:36.263 --> 01:32:40.407]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:32:40.607 --> 01:32:43.470]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:45.111]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:32:45.211 --> 01:32:48.394]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:32:48.674 --> 01:32:50.997]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:32:51.277 --> 01:32:52.238]  It's in powder form.
[01:32:52.338 --> 01:32:55.040]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:32:55.220 --> 01:32:55.821]  I take this.
[01:32:55.941 --> 01:32:57.623]  This is the product that I take.

[01:33:07.271 --> 01:33:08.532]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:08.552 --> 01:33:28.287]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowars.
[01:33:36.022 --> 01:33:38.265]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:38.305 --> 01:33:40.747]  We have been speaking with Ben Garrison.
[01:33:41.208 --> 01:33:43.891]  Ben Garrison is a political cartoonist.
[01:33:43.991 --> 01:33:48.015]  His website is GRRRGraphics.com.
[01:33:48.055 --> 01:33:50.177]  That's GRRRGraphics.com.
[01:33:50.618 --> 01:33:55.163]  Now Ben, I wanted to kind of get your take as a libertarian cartoonist.
[01:33:55.783 --> 01:34:02.866]  Who now says you're actively working to make sure Hillary does not get her monstrous hands on the White House.
[01:34:03.367 --> 01:34:16.733]  What do you think about the never-Trumpers, who would rather have someone like Hillary Clinton, who is completely opposite of their supposed conservative ideals, they'd rather have her give her four more years to wreck this country than get Trump in?
[01:34:19.124 --> 01:34:24.586]  This is something that I've been trying to discuss with my few remaining liberal friends.
[01:34:24.687 --> 01:34:28.468]  I've had three separate liberal friends write me and say, I don't like Hillary.
[01:34:28.488 --> 01:34:28.908]  You're right.
[01:34:28.988 --> 01:34:29.929]  We know she's a liar.
[01:34:29.969 --> 01:34:30.709]  She's a good liar.
[01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:34.451]  But I have to vote for her because Trump is a loose cannon.
[01:34:34.491 --> 01:34:36.252]  They all said the exact same thing.
[01:34:36.592 --> 01:34:37.972]  Trump is a loose cannon.
[01:34:38.513 --> 01:34:43.255]  And so my retort was, well, don't we need a loose cannon when the corruption is becoming so
[01:34:43.715 --> 01:34:46.256]  It's obvious, it's like on display and in your face.
[01:34:46.856 --> 01:34:55.857]  It's time for a loose cannon to get up there and try to blow out all the garbage that's been deposited in the White House and on Capitol Hill for so many years.
[01:34:56.658 --> 01:35:01.559]  And so that's what I tell them, but they still insist that she's got experience.
[01:35:01.619 --> 01:35:03.999]  I said, well, she's an experienced criminal.
[01:35:04.419 --> 01:35:08.420]  Look at the disastrous record she had as Secretary of State.
[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:16.162]  Look at all the... Even as a senator, she managed to get into trouble and was censored by the Senate.
[01:35:16.562 --> 01:35:20.144]  So, to me, the obvious choice is Trump.
[01:35:20.204 --> 01:35:21.824]  Now, is Trump a perfect candidate?
[01:35:22.104 --> 01:35:22.964]  Of course he's not.
[01:35:23.044 --> 01:35:24.445]  Ron Paul was a perfect candidate.
[01:35:24.805 --> 01:35:30.527]  But Trump, actually, I believe he sincerely cares about America and he really does want to make it great again.
[01:35:31.227 --> 01:35:38.730]  Whereas Hillary will get in there and continue the cronyism and pocket-filling of her corrupt buddies.
[01:35:38.910 --> 01:35:39.871]  That's what she's going to do.
[01:35:39.931 --> 01:35:43.793]  I mean, do you think the Leopard's going to change her spots once she gets into the White House?
[01:35:43.833 --> 01:35:45.633]  No, she's going to be even more emboldened.
[01:35:46.454 --> 01:35:48.735]  And that's why we've got to keep her out of there.
[01:35:49.568 --> 01:35:55.911]  That's why I'm going to continue to draw the cartoons to try to sway a few minds.
[01:35:55.991 --> 01:36:06.736]  Now, when I drew that Brexit cartoon, to my surprise, I had an avalanche of people writing me, mostly from England, and they said that that cartoon influenced them.
[01:36:06.816 --> 01:36:08.617]  And it's like, I broke a logjam.
[01:36:08.637 --> 01:36:16.721]  They're actually able to start talking about how they're objected to the EU abuses as well as forced immigration.
[01:36:17.601 --> 01:36:18.662]  By Muslims.
[01:36:18.902 --> 01:36:24.165]  And so my cartoon sort of triggered that conversation.
[01:36:24.665 --> 01:36:27.066]  Whereas before, they were afraid that they'd be called racist.
[01:36:27.106 --> 01:36:28.947]  They're afraid that they'd be saying, well, I'm a hater.
[01:36:28.967 --> 01:36:32.870]  But when I drew that cartoon, it showed up everywhere in Europe.
[01:36:33.729 --> 01:36:35.591]  And I'm still selling a lot of prints today.
[01:36:35.611 --> 01:36:38.653]  It's like, that's what a cartoon should do.
[01:36:38.673 --> 01:36:40.634]  That's what a successful cartoon should do.
[01:36:40.654 --> 01:36:44.698]  It should sway minds and at least, at the very least, generate debate.
[01:36:44.838 --> 01:36:48.681]  And so I consider that cartoon is my most successful cartoon of the year.
[01:36:50.245 --> 01:36:50.945]  Absolutely.
[01:36:50.965 --> 01:37:00.130]  And so, I mean, just like I was saying earlier, these are the things that people need to be sharing on Facebook, on Twitter, are these political cartoons and these memes.
[01:37:00.250 --> 01:37:01.510]  They're so powerful.
[01:37:01.911 --> 01:37:10.675]  It's so easy to just hit send or, you know, retweet or something like that to really get this message out there, to let people know that it's okay to ask.
[01:37:11.135 --> 01:37:12.556]  What the heck is wrong with Hillary?
[01:37:12.676 --> 01:37:14.277]  Why does she seem so unhealthy?
[01:37:14.377 --> 01:37:17.679]  Why does she have to take days off from her speeches?
[01:37:17.739 --> 01:37:22.082]  Why does she need stools to prop her up because she can't even stand?
[01:37:22.562 --> 01:37:29.427]  She's trying to get the debates to be sit-down debates just so people won't see how weak she is on her feet.
[01:37:30.127 --> 01:37:38.953]  Does this frighten you at all that we have such a powerful media protecting her and you're kind of working at this with cartoons?
[01:37:42.159 --> 01:37:44.660]  Well, I try to watch all sides of the media.
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:58.467]  I mean, I even watched a lot of CNN during the primaries, and it's just disgusting how the media is supposed to be a watchdog, but now they're attack dogs for Hillary.
[01:37:59.368 --> 01:38:01.749]  I'll give you an example.
[01:38:01.789 --> 01:38:08.752]  With one 15-minute segment on CNN, I heard them call Hillary historic at least a dozen times.
[01:38:08.912 --> 01:38:11.354]  At the same time, they kept calling Trump divisive.
[01:38:12.114 --> 01:38:13.857]  So it's really a form of brainwashing.
[01:38:13.897 --> 01:38:26.495]  They're hoping people are so stupid that they could play this Jedi mind trick on them, you know, and suddenly they're going to vote for Hillary despite all the obvious crimes and corruption that trail behind her.
[01:38:27.506 --> 01:38:31.548]  And so, this is what's so important about alternative media.
[01:38:32.129 --> 01:38:37.391]  Increasingly, a lot of young people, they're not tuning into these major mainstream media channels.
[01:38:37.431 --> 01:38:47.577]  They're going to get their news from alternative media, where they can actually find some truth and some actual investigative journalism, which isn't happening on the mainstream media.
[01:38:47.617 --> 01:38:51.499]  They're just carrying the ball for the New World Order.
[01:38:53.337 --> 01:38:53.958]  Installments.
[01:38:55.039 --> 01:38:55.740]  The selections.
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:56.922]  It's not really an election.
[01:38:56.962 --> 01:38:59.285]  It's a selection as far as the Democrats go.
[01:38:59.325 --> 01:39:00.246]  Look how rigged it was.
[01:39:00.907 --> 01:39:02.649]  Look how they stole it from Bernie Sanders.
[01:39:04.147 --> 01:39:14.809]  I heard that he may have probably even won in California, but they rigged the election, the primary rules, so that the superdelegates have the final say, and thus they strip away the voice of the people.
[01:39:15.409 --> 01:39:24.770]  Now, in this cartoon that you're showing here, my older brother actually supported Bernie and actually sent him some money, and my older brother's featured on the upper right, and so I included him in there.
[01:39:25.451 --> 01:39:32.252]  And this has to be the biggest political backstabbing in history, the way he suddenly went with her.
[01:39:33.872 --> 01:39:58.269]  There's something I know behind the scenes that took place whether they roughed up Bernie or they threatened his family they did something for him to do that because he was well known as a man of integrity then suddenly he's going for Hillary and then you know if you looked if you saw him during the the DNC too he did not look happy and this cartoon here um I was I was hoping there would be a lot more outrage uh against Hillary for the uh
[01:39:59.380 --> 01:40:01.161]  The fact that the whole thing was rigged.
[01:40:01.422 --> 01:40:02.702]  And there was a lot of outrage.
[01:40:02.723 --> 01:40:05.244]  A lot of Bernie supporters wouldn't go to the convention.
[01:40:05.284 --> 01:40:06.125]  So what did Hillary do?
[01:40:06.145 --> 01:40:10.388]  She puts an ad on Craigslist for actors to show up and fill seats.
[01:40:13.263 --> 01:40:18.865]  It's all such a cynical ruse on her part, and yet she still expects to be president.
[01:40:18.885 --> 01:40:23.606]  So I want to try to help wake people up and say, look, don't fall for her Jedi mind trick.
[01:40:23.666 --> 01:40:26.347]  You don't want to vote for her just because she's a woman.
[01:40:26.967 --> 01:40:33.029]  You know, I'm all for having a female president, but it just can't be her because she is not on the side of women.
[01:40:33.129 --> 01:40:37.430]  Just look for the fact that she accepted $25 million from Saudi Arabia.
[01:40:39.089 --> 01:40:40.530]  And look how they treat women there.
[01:40:41.110 --> 01:40:43.271]  Well, that just proves that she's liberal and loving.
[01:40:43.291 --> 01:40:44.952]  And she's for women.
[01:40:46.593 --> 01:40:47.253]  Well, she's not.
[01:40:47.333 --> 01:40:48.013]  She's not really.
[01:40:48.053 --> 01:40:50.134]  She claims she's a progressive, sure.
[01:40:50.194 --> 01:40:52.696]  But what happens when she gets into the White House?
[01:40:52.776 --> 01:40:57.138]  All of her campaign promises will end up
[01:40:58.473 --> 01:41:00.675]  Just being what they are, empty.
[01:41:01.355 --> 01:41:06.959]  So she's really carrying on Barack Obama's administration.
[01:41:06.979 --> 01:41:08.199]  She's really kind of a neocon.
[01:41:08.219 --> 01:41:11.702]  That's why many of the Republican neocons would rather vote for Hillary than Trump.
[01:41:12.591 --> 01:41:15.973]  Yeah, exactly, because they know what they're going to get with Hillary Clinton.
[01:41:16.013 --> 01:41:21.616]  She is going to be the final nail in the coffin here for the West, and they're afraid of Trump.
[01:41:21.776 --> 01:41:23.837]  They say, you know, he is a loose cannon.
[01:41:24.198 --> 01:41:31.942]  Well, how can someone be so successful in business, have such a well-rounded family, no one's had any major scandals?
[01:41:32.442 --> 01:41:34.604]  This isn't someone who is a loose cannon.
[01:41:34.864 --> 01:41:39.907]  He's someone who obviously has a lot of experience in making difficult decisions, employing
[01:41:40.527 --> 01:41:59.316]  Hundreds of thousands of people, tens of thousands, you know, I'm not sure, but he's a jobs creator, and he speaks his mind, he speaks the truth, and then here we have a president, a current president, who's been caught in lie after lie, and then someone else they're trying to roll in, who has been caught in lie after lie.
[01:41:59.896 --> 01:42:03.898]  So, you know, you're really up against a major machine with the pushback.
[01:42:05.103 --> 01:42:15.793]  Well, that machine kept abusing, I'm talking about the Republican establishment this time, but they kept abusing the Republican supporters.
[01:42:17.215 --> 01:42:18.176]  They wanted change.
[01:42:18.536 --> 01:42:22.199]  We wanted to get the Tea Party in there, and what happened?
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:24.862]  They totally discredited the Tea Party.
[01:42:24.902 --> 01:42:26.443]  They stole tea baggers.
[01:42:26.483 --> 01:42:28.665]  They showed them with gross disrespect.
[01:42:29.747 --> 01:42:32.889]  And people are angry that their voice is being stripped away.
[01:42:32.989 --> 01:42:38.512]  So Trump comes along and they can't understand why everybody wants Trump.
[01:42:38.612 --> 01:42:42.915]  Well, because they don't want the same old Republican establishment pulling the strings.
[01:42:43.756 --> 01:42:50.480]  So here we have Trump who actually wants to help America first, rather than the globalists first.
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:52.341]  He wants to build a wall.
[01:42:52.381 --> 01:42:53.241]  He wants to have some
[01:42:54.642 --> 01:43:00.586]  Terrorists, NTPP, and he's thinking about America and its greatness and its prosperity of the people.
[01:43:00.606 --> 01:43:07.371]  I mean, look, the 1%, the 1-10th of 1% has more wealth than the bottom 90% in America.
[01:43:07.891 --> 01:43:16.377]  And Trump wants to bring back some jobs to the people, and that includes bringing jobs to African Americans.
[01:43:16.437 --> 01:43:18.458]  I'm surprised more blacks aren't supporting Trump.
[01:43:18.759 --> 01:43:23.202]  Because it seems like every time they try to get a Democrat in there to help them,
[01:43:24.102 --> 01:43:25.163]  They get kicked in the teeth.
[01:43:25.223 --> 01:43:30.749]  So I'm hoping that Trump will have more Hispanic and African American support as well.
[01:43:31.775 --> 01:43:45.958]  Yeah, and I think the tide is really turning on that as well, because with all of this unrest that we're seeing across the country, they're starting to recognize that this is happening in these cities that have been run by Democrats for decades.
[01:43:46.278 --> 01:43:52.400]  And they're starting to understand that it's not just your average white person out in the suburbs that is holding them down.
[01:43:52.860 --> 01:44:00.082]  It is the policies that have been put in place, these Democratic progressive policies, that are stopping them from moving forward.
[01:44:00.402 --> 01:44:01.222]  You know, what happened?
[01:44:01.482 --> 01:44:10.005]  We were really seeing a rising middle class within the African-American community, minority communities, and then all of a sudden, that completely changed.
[01:44:10.345 --> 01:44:16.708]  I mean, it's hard for anyone to make it into the middle class nowadays, but I think that the tide is really turning with that narrative.
[01:44:17.848 --> 01:44:20.889]  They're starting to recognize that it's the policies that are the problem.
[01:44:21.469 --> 01:44:27.992]  So, do you see yourself addressing that within your cartoons to kind of
[01:44:29.112 --> 01:44:33.276]  Talk specifically to, say, the African American community in particular?
[01:44:33.296 --> 01:44:46.327]  I'd like to, but the overall picture is this, and one of the reasons I like Trump is he also said he wanted to audit the Federal Reserve and I think that's
[01:44:47.318 --> 01:44:47.998]  That's critical.
[01:44:48.219 --> 01:44:49.319]  Yes.
[01:44:49.519 --> 01:44:51.840]  That is the heart of darkness in this country.
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:54.742]  We have a dysfunctional, immoral money supply.
[01:44:57.383 --> 01:45:01.085]  Once we get the audit, then we can get on the road to ending the Fed.
[01:45:01.206 --> 01:45:05.328]  It's my hope that Trump will end up being like an Andrew Jackson figure.
[01:45:06.591 --> 01:45:13.075]  He was also a populist and the establishment really despised him.
[01:45:13.535 --> 01:45:17.217]  But once he got in there, it took him two terms, but he got rid of the central bankers.
[01:45:17.877 --> 01:45:18.237]  Who knows?
[01:45:18.297 --> 01:45:23.941]  Maybe Trump can do the same because we need a total money revolution, so to speak.
[01:45:23.981 --> 01:45:25.661]  We need a debt jubilee.
[01:45:25.681 --> 01:45:30.104]  I mean, look at all the kids who are like over $1 trillion in college debt.
[01:45:30.944 --> 01:45:35.187]  We have to do something to address that problem because
[01:45:37.081 --> 01:45:39.883]  We got the national debt up to almost 20 trillion.
[01:45:40.784 --> 01:45:42.065]  How long could that keep going?
[01:45:42.105 --> 01:45:48.451]  What's happening is like it's making a tiny elite, crony elite, it's not capitalism, it's crony capital.
[01:45:48.471 --> 01:45:52.794]  They're getting far richer while all the other Americans are continuing to get poorer.
[01:45:53.615 --> 01:45:58.780]  So I'd like to see Trump go in there and at least have an audit of the Federal Reserve.
[01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:01.102]  And he said he was open to that idea, so we'll see.
[01:46:01.644 --> 01:46:02.224]  Absolutely.
[01:46:02.244 --> 01:46:06.526]  And so, obviously, auditing the Fed is very important.
[01:46:06.626 --> 01:46:15.910]  What else do you see as some key issues that people really should be focusing on, what they really should be asking of Hillary Clinton if and when she ever decides to give a press conference?
[01:46:15.930 --> 01:46:25.994]  I would like to see her, well, it doesn't matter what they ask her because she's just going to answer with empty platitudes.
[01:46:27.315 --> 01:46:29.096]  You know, everything is arranged.
[01:46:29.176 --> 01:46:31.497]  She's probably not going to have one unless she has control.
[01:46:31.517 --> 01:46:33.278]  She has to have control of the questions.
[01:46:33.338 --> 01:46:34.719]  She doesn't like to be surprised.
[01:46:35.179 --> 01:46:39.582]  But if they could ask her some questions, it should be about foreign policy and what she plans to do.
[01:46:40.752 --> 01:46:46.718]  I wish we could get a president like Ron Paul that could just get us out of all the wars in the Middle East.
[01:46:47.839 --> 01:46:49.741]  And I hope Trump could do some of that.
[01:46:49.901 --> 01:46:52.904]  Hillary's far more dangerous because she's a war monger.
[01:46:52.944 --> 01:46:53.885]  She loves war.
[01:46:54.406 --> 01:46:55.427]  She murdered Gaddafi.
[01:46:55.487 --> 01:46:56.728]  Laughed about it.
[01:47:02.914 --> 01:47:13.981]  She's far more dangerous than Trump, and Trump has even said that he would be willing to talk to Putin, whereas Hillary's going to be setting up no-fly zones over Syria and provoking World War III.
[01:47:14.361 --> 01:47:14.581]  Why?
[01:47:14.621 --> 01:47:15.502]  Because she enjoys it.
[01:47:15.582 --> 01:47:17.443]  I think she enjoys killing people.
[01:47:17.764 --> 01:47:20.686]  She's the one who pushed the button on Waco and had that disaster.
[01:47:21.526 --> 01:47:23.868]  She might have been somebody behind Oklahoma City.
[01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:30.133]  Just look at the DNC guy who got shot in the back of the head.
[01:47:30.153 --> 01:47:32.775]  I personally think she's a murderer.
[01:47:33.816 --> 01:47:37.720]  We don't want a murderer like that in the White House because then she could turn into a mass murderer.
[01:47:38.757 --> 01:47:39.937]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:40.058 --> 01:47:41.138]  And that's what a lot of people say.
[01:47:41.178 --> 01:47:42.438]  Well, she has experience.
[01:47:42.819 --> 01:47:45.800]  And like you point out, she has experience in killing people.
[01:47:46.340 --> 01:47:48.701]  She has experience in lying to people.
[01:47:48.761 --> 01:47:53.983]  She has experience in working the media and getting them to do her bidding and cover up for her.
[01:47:54.423 --> 01:47:57.564]  She has experience going in and destabilizing countries.
[01:47:58.024 --> 01:48:03.767]  What do you think about the fact that they are really, once again, propping up Russia to be the boogeyman?
[01:48:08.715 --> 01:48:11.396]  We already saw that how they went into Ukraine and stole the gold.
[01:48:11.656 --> 01:48:13.277]  Globalists want control.
[01:48:13.297 --> 01:48:17.978]  They don't want anybody to have their own system of money and Russia standing in their way.
[01:48:18.799 --> 01:48:20.319]  Now, I'm not a big fan of Putin.
[01:48:20.379 --> 01:48:22.780]  He's a strong man and a dictator.
[01:48:25.615 --> 01:48:37.625]  Trump is much more willing to talk with him and avoid war, whereas Hillary, again, I don't know what she's going to end up doing, but do we really want somebody who's got the onset of dementia with her finger on the button?
[01:48:38.166 --> 01:48:42.089]  They say Trump is the loose cannon and the dangerous person and dark.
[01:48:42.209 --> 01:48:48.374]  Well, Hillary, she's the one who's dark and she's the one who can't be trusted with the nuclear football, that's for sure.
[01:48:48.394 --> 01:48:49.615]  I mean, who knows?
[01:48:50.136 --> 01:48:51.337]  Once her health starts to fade,
[01:48:51.997 --> 01:48:52.377]  I don't know.
[01:48:53.598 --> 01:49:02.505]  Frankly, I don't really understand why the globalists even have her installed in the first place if they knew that she has these ongoing health issues.
[01:49:02.905 --> 01:49:05.087]  That's one thing I haven't been able to figure out yet.
[01:49:05.147 --> 01:49:06.468]  Maybe Alex can figure that out.
[01:49:07.344 --> 01:49:14.468]  Right, if she gets in there, she's going to have to implement the New World Order plans ASAP because who knows how long she'll be around.
[01:49:15.168 --> 01:49:17.229]  And it's funny how they kind of come after Trump.
[01:49:17.489 --> 01:49:21.211]  How dare he want to open up the lines of communication with Putin?
[01:49:21.691 --> 01:49:30.676]  Meanwhile, we have President Obama opening up the lines of communication with Iran and basically setting them up to have nuclear power.
[01:49:30.696 --> 01:49:34.558]  And then lying to our faces saying it wasn't a
[01:49:36.775 --> 01:49:39.676]  It wasn't ransom, and then a week later we find out, yes, it was ransom.
[01:49:40.176 --> 01:49:44.637]  And that's an extremely bad precedent to send to other countries.
[01:49:46.197 --> 01:49:48.538]  Hillary also is going to come after the guns.
[01:49:50.298 --> 01:49:55.759]  If you've watched her during the primaries, she's always talking about guns doing this and guns doing that.
[01:49:55.819 --> 01:50:00.200]  It's almost like the guns somehow magically get themselves out of the gun safe, go out and kill people.
[01:50:00.701 --> 01:50:02.301]  And so we have to go after those guns.
[01:50:03.021 --> 01:50:07.364]  She is going to be a lot more hardcore about coming after our guns than Obama was.
[01:50:07.425 --> 01:50:20.715]  Obama tried a lot of subtleties that didn't work, but Hillary's going to be far more ruthless, because she always gets away with everything, and that just encourages her to do worse things.
[01:50:21.314 --> 01:50:21.554]  Right.
[01:50:22.034 --> 01:50:31.557]  And we know that she's going to tug on America's heartstrings with the gun grabbing, just like we saw in Venezuela when they first had their gun roundup just a few years ago.
[01:50:31.997 --> 01:50:35.778]  And it was all about, you know, we want to be a peaceful, peaceful society.
[01:50:36.118 --> 01:50:38.238]  Really, it's because they saw the writing on the wall.
[01:50:38.298 --> 01:50:45.220]  They knew that they were going to be in these dire straits and they didn't want an armed, angry, starving populace.
[01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:48.664]  And here again, they're doing another gun roundup in Venezuela.
[01:50:48.684 --> 01:50:51.267]  So we know that that's going to be something that's happening here as well.
[01:50:51.688 --> 01:50:53.109]  My guest is Ben Garrison.
[01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:56.954]  And that's GRRRgraphics.com.
[01:50:56.974 --> 01:50:58.196]  Stick around, we'll be right back.
[01:51:12.514 --> 01:51:16.820]  Americanism, not globalism will be our credo!
[01:51:19.443 --> 01:51:21.526]  Americanism, not globalism!
[01:51:24.876 --> 01:51:28.917]  The era of economic surrender will finally be over.
[01:51:29.237 --> 01:51:35.318]  We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
[01:51:35.698 --> 01:51:43.220]  They have gotten the political establishment and the media establishment to become pure, wanton henchmen of totalitarianism.
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:51.942]  If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda.
[01:51:52.382 --> 01:51:54.943]  I think what the Chinese have done is really smart.
[01:51:55.464 --> 01:52:06.088]  The skyscrapers went up in Beijing and many other cities around the world, while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled right here in Detroit.
[01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:12.271]  It's all training us to accept less, lowering expectations, a post-industrial world, a new dark age.
[01:52:12.411 --> 01:52:16.253]  That's what the UN Biological Diversity Assessment 1996 calls for.
[01:52:16.493 --> 01:52:19.935]  When we abandoned the policy of America first,
[01:52:20.755 --> 01:52:24.757]  We started rebuilding other countries instead of our own.
[01:52:25.157 --> 01:52:29.259]  Not a world, Winston, that gets more beautiful and more technological and stronger.
[01:52:29.539 --> 01:52:32.320]  A world that gets uglier and stupider and more stunted.
[01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:39.203]  The government should allow Hillary Clinton to become President of the United States.
[01:52:39.683 --> 01:52:41.403]  I voted for Hillary Clinton.
[01:52:41.724 --> 01:52:42.764]  Well, I voted for Hillary.
[01:52:42.784 --> 01:52:44.965]  I guess I have to since I'm working for her as well.
[01:52:45.365 --> 01:52:47.267]  You want an image of the future, Winston?
[01:52:47.467 --> 01:52:49.649]  It's a boot stomping on a human face forever!
[01:52:49.769 --> 01:52:56.196]  Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.
[01:52:56.356 --> 01:53:00.820]  Women are treated, discriminated against in all these countries she took money against.
[01:53:01.161 --> 01:53:04.664]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely.
[01:53:04.724 --> 01:53:05.585]  They're mistreated.
[01:53:06.286 --> 01:53:07.607]  She claims to be their champion.
[01:53:08.027 --> 01:53:16.638]  Don't look at me, Winston, and see the black circles around my eyes, and see how ugly and weak I am, expressing myself and dying, and I torture people 18 hours a day, and I have a horrible life!
[01:53:16.859 --> 01:53:21.084]  That's the beauty of the satanic evil of the priest of power, ripping apart humanity!
[01:53:21.104 --> 01:53:22.486]  We're here to hurt humans!
[01:53:22.606 --> 01:53:24.108]  We're here to suck your guts out!
[01:53:40.074 --> 01:53:41.955]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[01:53:42.016 --> 01:53:43.897]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[01:53:43.977 --> 01:53:46.679]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[01:53:46.899 --> 01:53:47.720]  Alex Jones.
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:50.562]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:53:50.622 --> 01:53:53.824]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:53:53.864 --> 01:53:55.165]  Deeply I think racist.
[01:53:55.285 --> 01:53:57.127]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[01:53:57.227 --> 01:53:59.028]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[01:53:59.048 --> 01:54:03.131]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[01:54:03.151 --> 01:54:04.312]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:04.372 --> 01:54:09.296]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:54:23.467 --> 01:54:25.269]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:25.449 --> 01:54:27.331]  I am your host Leigh-Anne McAdoo.
[01:54:27.371 --> 01:54:30.594]  We have been speaking with Ben Garrison, political cartoonist.
[01:54:31.014 --> 01:54:39.542]  So important to support independent artists out there who are exposing the globalists, bringing you the truth in whatever way that may be.
[01:54:40.103 --> 01:54:46.449]  That's why it's also very important to support independent filmmakers out there who are doing the same thing, exposing the globalists.
[01:54:47.290 --> 01:54:51.054]  We've got the new Amerageddon film by Mike Norris and Gary Haven.
[01:54:51.294 --> 01:54:55.338]  It's now being sold exclusively at the InfoWars store.
[01:54:55.659 --> 01:54:57.981]  I know a lot of people out there saying, where can we get this film?
[01:54:58.021 --> 01:54:59.483]  We want to see it, we want to show our friends.
[01:54:59.743 --> 01:55:03.047]  You can get it exclusively at the InfoWars store.

[01:55:10.974 --> 01:55:14.157]  It's a great tool to help wake up your friends and family.
[01:55:14.557 --> 01:55:17.500]  And Alex Jones is so in support of this film.

[01:56:35.558 --> 01:56:42.303]  Now going back to our guest, Ben Garrison, the website is grrgraphics.com.
[01:56:43.004 --> 01:56:44.785]  So Ben, what do you think about this?
[01:56:44.865 --> 01:56:48.507]  We see now independent film, independent artists.
[01:56:48.968 --> 01:56:51.830]  This is the way that we are getting this message out there.
[01:56:51.910 --> 01:56:58.634]  This is the way that we're having to take it to the streets because we don't get the support now of our supposed free press.
[01:57:00.195 --> 01:57:02.096]  That's a good point and I encourage everybody to
[01:57:06.213 --> 01:57:09.817]  But it's also important to do it yourself.
[01:57:09.917 --> 01:57:11.498]  I encourage all the young people out there.
[01:57:11.759 --> 01:57:15.663]  I've had a lot of young artists write me and I say, hey, you could be a cartoonist too.
[01:57:16.684 --> 01:57:22.731]  Just fight that inertia, the stuff that's keeping you from not doing it, and just get out there and start doing it.
[01:57:24.777 --> 01:57:28.101]  And I encourage everybody to be their own citizen muckraker.
[01:57:28.662 --> 01:57:30.003]  Be their own squeaky wheel.
[01:57:30.724 --> 01:57:32.586]  Everybody can do something.
[01:57:32.626 --> 01:57:34.348]  Everybody has a talent to do something.
[01:57:34.949 --> 01:57:38.934]  And don't depend on the mainstream media to tell you the truth anymore.
[01:57:38.974 --> 01:57:42.538]  They're actually working hard against our own best interests.
[01:57:43.331 --> 01:57:47.895]  So, my father fought in World War II, and he was in many battles.
[01:57:48.556 --> 01:57:53.761]  And then in 2008, when the banker bailout occurred, I thought to myself, well, what can I do?
[01:57:53.821 --> 01:57:56.383]  I never did anything for my country other than pay taxes.
[01:57:56.723 --> 01:57:57.404]  Well, what can I do?
[01:57:57.424 --> 01:57:58.164]  Well, I'm an artist.
[01:57:58.245 --> 01:58:00.627]  I'll start drawing some cartoons, and that's how it started.
[01:58:01.147 --> 01:58:02.529]  So everybody has a talent out there.
[01:58:02.549 --> 01:58:03.511]  Everybody can do something.
[01:58:03.551 --> 01:58:15.909]  So support all the patriots who are independent journalists and alternative media, but also do some of this stuff yourself, even if it's just telling your friends and family and try to inform the people that are
[01:58:16.681 --> 01:58:23.366]  Or hypnotized into voting for Hillary simply because she's a woman and they want to do something historic.
[01:58:23.566 --> 01:58:25.467]  Try to inform and sway those people.
[01:58:25.527 --> 01:58:30.451]  We all have to sharpen our debate skills and try to talk them out of it.
[01:58:30.551 --> 01:58:34.214]  Yeah, and surprisingly a lot of people want to talk about politics this time around.
[01:58:34.714 --> 01:58:44.842]  And a lot of people can go out there, if you want a Trigger-worthy t-shirt, they can actually go to your website grrgraphics.com and pick up the Weekend at Hillary's t-shirt.
[01:58:45.062 --> 01:58:48.545]  Trigger, your friends and family support those Patriot artists out there.
[01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:56.692]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:59.813 --> 01:59:01.655]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:59:01.715 --> 01:59:03.596]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:59:03.737 --> 01:59:06.579]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:59:06.639 --> 01:59:12.504]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:59:12.704 --> 01:59:20.091]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[01:59:20.211 --> 01:59:21.593]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:59:21.893 --> 01:59:29.181]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:59:29.441 --> 01:59:37.149]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:59:37.470 --> 01:59:38.431]  The general public doesn't.
[01:59:39.634 --> 01:59:41.955]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:59:43.575 --> 01:59:46.997]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:59:47.137 --> 01:59:53.619]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:59:53.859 --> 01:59:58.120]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[02:00:02.502 --> 02:00:05.103]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:21.465 --> 02:00:26.048]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:26.268 --> 02:00:31.090]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:53.630 --> 02:00:55.491]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:55.611 --> 02:00:56.571]  I am Leanne McAtee.
[02:00:56.591 --> 02:00:59.412]  We've been speaking with political cartoonist Ben Garrison.
[02:00:59.452 --> 02:01:03.433]  Now coming up, just after the break, we're going to be having Joe Biggs in studio.
[02:01:03.453 --> 02:01:06.294]  We'll be speaking with investigative reporter Wayne Madsen.
[02:01:06.914 --> 02:01:08.374]  All of that is coming up.
[02:01:08.914 --> 02:01:13.275]  But Ben, I wanted to kind of talk to you a little bit about what triggers you?
[02:01:13.916 --> 02:01:16.036]  How do you get inspired with these cartoons?
[02:01:16.096 --> 02:01:19.057]  Is it just the hullabaloo that's coming out of the media?
[02:01:19.217 --> 02:01:21.738]  Or how do you get triggered enough to do something about it?
[02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:26.263]  Well, a lot of my ideas just come like bolts out of the blue.
[02:01:26.283 --> 02:01:28.085]  I mean, those are the best ideas, too.
[02:01:28.145 --> 02:01:29.306]  I call it vertical thinking.
[02:01:29.366 --> 02:01:31.008]  They just come right down into my brain.
[02:01:31.949 --> 02:01:37.515]  Other ones that are horizontal in nature, it takes a lot of time to work them out.
[02:01:40.498 --> 02:01:44.899]  Well, I'm surprised that so many people out there... I mean, I must get like a half a dozen.
[02:01:44.999 --> 02:01:49.421]  Every day I get like a half a dozen ideas sent to me by people all over the world.
[02:01:49.761 --> 02:01:52.281]  They all have their own ideas for a political cartoon.
[02:01:52.301 --> 02:01:55.282]  And many of them are excellent ideas.
[02:01:55.342 --> 02:01:57.163]  I just don't have the time to do it.
[02:01:57.183 --> 02:02:00.284]  I'm not quite there yet where I can make a living doing the cartoons.
[02:02:01.084 --> 02:02:07.926]  Now, once upon a time in the golden age of newspapers, there were like a thousand paid editorial cartoonists all around, all across the country.
[02:02:07.946 --> 02:02:11.828]  And then by the 80s, it was down to around 100, and now it's around 30.
[02:02:12.928 --> 02:02:25.072]  So the traditional newspaper editorial cartoonist is going away, but we're seeing a renaissance of sorts now on the internet and alternative media on the internet.
[02:02:25.672 --> 02:02:27.034]  With editorial cartooning.
[02:02:27.194 --> 02:02:42.915]  So, and it's very encouraging to see a few more conservative cartoonists out there too, because for a very long time, the liberal cartoonists had a stranglehold on cartoonists, the debate as far as editorial cartoons go.
[02:02:43.656 --> 02:02:47.117]  And most of them are always, pretty much, they were lazy.
[02:02:47.197 --> 02:02:49.657]  They were just like, well-drawn insults were all they were.
[02:02:49.737 --> 02:02:50.978]  Oh, you like guns?
[02:02:50.998 --> 02:02:51.638]  You're a redneck.
[02:02:52.218 --> 02:02:54.338]  Oh, you know, you don't like big government?
[02:02:54.378 --> 02:02:54.998]  You're a racist.
[02:02:55.398 --> 02:02:56.779]  That's what they all boiled down to.
[02:02:57.259 --> 02:03:07.741]  So, but now we're starting to see a few more conservative editorial cartoonists, such as myself, have a larger voice on the internet, and that's very encouraging.
[02:03:07.781 --> 02:03:12.142]  And once again, I want to encourage all you young artists out there, you can do it too, so get busy.
[02:03:13.197 --> 02:03:14.037]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:03:14.077 --> 02:03:15.978]  That's kind of what Alex is always saying.
[02:03:16.178 --> 02:03:20.740]  We're always being sent in such great leads, such great ideas, but we can't be everywhere all at once.
[02:03:21.100 --> 02:03:25.841]  And it is going to take a legion of us to fight against this New World Order.
[02:03:26.162 --> 02:03:35.545]  As we can see, they've got all cylinders firing and really trying to silence any critics, silence conservatives, silence libertarians, you know, with the name calling.
[02:03:35.565 --> 02:03:37.466]  They're trying to silence me.
[02:03:37.506 --> 02:03:38.646]  I sure didn't face that.
[02:03:39.006 --> 02:03:40.927]  First thing I found out, I said, why aren't
[02:03:41.787 --> 02:03:45.030]  How come no editorial cartoonist is drawing anti-Federal Reserve cartoons?
[02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:48.473]  And as soon as I started doing it, I found out, well, I found out why.
[02:03:48.553 --> 02:03:51.696]  Because, hey, I started getting called anti-Semitic and a Nazi.
[02:03:52.656 --> 02:03:53.917]  I started getting called a racist.
[02:03:54.638 --> 02:04:00.163]  And so anybody who's now even slightly right of center, you get called far right.
[02:04:00.823 --> 02:04:02.044]  Even, you know, it's like,
[02:04:02.885 --> 02:04:05.187]  It's an either-or situation with the liberals.
[02:04:05.347 --> 02:04:09.010]  If you're even slightly conservative, you're a far-right Nazi.
[02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:14.474]  And Scott Adams, I think of Dilbert fame, had that happen to him when he came out in support of Trump.
[02:04:14.554 --> 02:04:19.537]  All of a sudden, he started getting called all these horrific names and people were threatening his life and threatening his business.
[02:04:19.577 --> 02:04:22.219]  So he said, okay, I support Hillary then.
[02:04:22.860 --> 02:04:26.222]  He said that in a cynical way, but just to get the heat off of him.
[02:04:26.242 --> 02:04:28.104]  And it worked because people stopped attacking him.
[02:04:29.068 --> 02:04:30.729]  But with me, I'm not going to say that.
[02:04:30.929 --> 02:04:32.609]  I'm still pretty irrational.
[02:04:32.689 --> 02:04:34.390]  I'm going to go ahead and stick with Trump.
[02:04:34.950 --> 02:04:37.051]  Right, and that's exactly it.
[02:04:37.131 --> 02:04:42.353]  If you are a free thinker in today's society, you are an extremist, so you've got to get in line.
[02:04:42.473 --> 02:04:44.634]  You've got to be prepared to take the flak.
[02:04:44.694 --> 02:04:45.514]  I was not prepared.
[02:04:45.554 --> 02:04:46.575]  I was really shocked.
[02:04:46.635 --> 02:04:47.815]  I would do anything to
[02:04:49.776 --> 02:04:51.696]  Well, I think most people are.
[02:04:51.756 --> 02:04:58.739]  They just get shoved down into that little fear factor, but we are so thankful that you have not cowed to the fear, Ben Garrison.
[02:04:59.119 --> 02:05:00.260]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:03.021]  That's GRRRgraphics.com.
[02:05:03.061 --> 02:05:06.042]  Go support these independent patriot artists.
[02:05:06.082 --> 02:05:07.763]  Go buy some prints and some t-shirts.
[02:05:07.783 --> 02:05:08.423]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:12.953 --> 02:05:16.095]  You said in a speech today you're afraid this election is going to be rigged.
[02:05:16.455 --> 02:05:18.216]  I've been hearing about it for a long time.
[02:05:18.356 --> 02:05:21.138]  I hope the Republicans get out there and watch very closely.
[02:05:21.158 --> 02:05:23.819]  This new poll is showing a big convention balance for Hillary Clinton.
[02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:27.962]  Following her nomination at the Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton now leads it.
[02:05:28.262 --> 02:05:30.243]  Donald Trump, 50% to 42%.
[02:05:30.283 --> 02:05:32.985]  That's a 7 point jump from last week.
[02:05:33.105 --> 02:05:35.546]  You see, he's supposed to just sit there and let them steal it.
[02:05:35.727 --> 02:05:37.307]  But he didn't sit there, so they failed.
[02:05:38.948 --> 02:05:45.953]  And they think they're gonna have another stolen general election in front of everybody at high noon, and we're just gonna sit here and go along with it.
[02:05:46.113 --> 02:05:46.454]  We're not.
[02:05:47.512 --> 02:05:48.232]  I'm gonna fight it.
[02:05:48.473 --> 02:05:49.333]  Trump's gonna fight it.
[02:05:49.573 --> 02:05:50.294]  You're gonna fight it.
[02:05:50.434 --> 02:05:52.395]  Bob Mulholland from Chico, California.
[02:05:52.435 --> 02:05:55.697]  I'm a DNC member, thus a superdelegate to the National Convention.
[02:05:55.977 --> 02:05:56.738]  First of all, it's rigged.
[02:05:57.318 --> 02:05:59.820]  And I'm afraid the election's gonna be rigged, I have to be honest.
[02:06:00.460 --> 02:06:05.343]  And the way we work is that anybody who gets 15% more in an election gets delegates.
[02:06:05.483 --> 02:06:07.464]  So this election will go all the way to California.
[02:06:07.825 --> 02:06:11.547]  Sanders will end up with well over a thousand delegates and Hillary will get the nomination.
[02:06:11.787 --> 02:06:20.490]  Hillary Clinton has had every advantage, every break given to her from the very beginning by this Democratic Party.
[02:06:20.590 --> 02:06:21.531]  It has been rigged.
[02:06:21.671 --> 02:06:33.395]  It is clearly the case that when given truth serum, Debbie Wasserman Schultz vastly prefers Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, obviously, and to the extent there are things that can be done institutionally and largely to
[02:06:34.035 --> 02:06:35.917]  Facilitate that outcome, they are being done.
[02:06:36.057 --> 02:06:44.325]  If Hillary steals the nomination, and then she openly is engaged in chicanery and things don't add up with Trump, you have to say it must be thrown out.
[02:06:44.686 --> 02:06:48.329]  The political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[02:06:48.469 --> 02:06:49.991]  Contrary to popular belief.
[02:06:50.311 --> 02:06:51.853]  Then why are they holding the primaries?
[02:06:52.848 --> 02:06:54.069]  That's a very good question.
[02:06:54.109 --> 02:06:57.952]  WikiLeaks has dumped nearly 20,000 hacked emails from the DNC.
[02:06:57.972 --> 02:07:05.178]  We're talking about the report of leaked DNC emails showing an effort to undermine Bernie Sanders during the primaries.
[02:07:05.518 --> 02:07:09.882]  The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.
[02:07:10.582 --> 02:07:15.545]  When did the press see it as their role to protect the prerogative of the powerful?
[02:07:15.605 --> 02:07:16.626]  Actually, I think that's part of it.
[02:07:16.846 --> 02:07:20.569]  And we're not going to recognize Queen Hillary if there's evidence of fraud.
[02:07:20.869 --> 02:07:21.909]  And guess what there is?
[02:07:21.989 --> 02:07:23.911]  She stole the nomination.
[02:07:24.191 --> 02:07:26.933]  I want to thank Bernie Sanders.
[02:07:27.933 --> 02:07:32.796]  If he would have just not done anything, just go home, go to sleep, relax, he would have been a hero.
[02:07:32.936 --> 02:07:34.657]  But he made a deal with the devil.
[02:07:34.698 --> 02:07:35.218]  She's the devil.
[02:07:35.238 --> 02:07:36.679]  He made a deal with the devil.
[02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:44.104]  The media has created the perception that the voters will decide the nomination and that's the concept, that's the conflict here.
[02:07:44.144 --> 02:07:46.085]  We feel like we live in a democratic society.
[02:07:46.125 --> 02:07:51.409]  What you're telling me is it's not a democratic society and your votes don't necessarily matter because it's a democratic representation.
[02:07:51.509 --> 02:07:53.770]  Crooked Hillary thinks they're going to pull what they did on Mitt Romney?
[02:07:54.131 --> 02:07:55.912]  Mm, lady, isn't going to happen.
[02:07:56.112 --> 02:08:01.235]  That's why her campaign head, her chief strategist said, this is dangerous what Trump's doing.
[02:08:01.636 --> 02:08:03.037]  You're right, it is dangerous, isn't it?
[02:08:03.677 --> 02:08:04.978]  Actually standing up to you.
[02:08:05.238 --> 02:08:07.840]  There has to come a point at which you say, enough.
[02:08:13.162 --> 02:08:22.104]  For every question they don't want you to ask, he has the answer they don't want you to hear.
[02:08:22.665 --> 02:08:25.365]  He is Alex Jones.
[02:08:29.884 --> 02:08:31.866]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:31.966 --> 02:08:33.047]  I am Leanne McAdoo.
[02:08:33.087 --> 02:08:38.412]  Joining me now is Joe Biggs, and we are going to be breaking down Trump's speech.
[02:08:38.612 --> 02:08:42.695]  Now, people are saying Donald Trump delivered the best speech of his life.
[02:08:42.895 --> 02:08:44.297]  I want to go to this first clip.
[02:08:44.737 --> 02:08:47.780]  This is where Trump lets the people know that he's never going to lie to us.
[02:08:51.297 --> 02:08:58.482]  But to achieve this new American future, we must break from the failures of the past.
[02:08:59.462 --> 02:09:01.864]  As you know, I'm not a politician.
[02:09:09.671 --> 02:09:15.554]  I've worked in business, created a great company, created lots of jobs, rebuilding neighborhoods.
[02:09:15.594 --> 02:09:18.476]  That's what I've done all of my adult life.
[02:09:19.336 --> 02:09:23.418]  I've never wanted to learn the language of the insiders.
[02:09:23.958 --> 02:09:26.800]  And I've never been politically correct.
[02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:28.381]  It takes far too much time.
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:44.926]  Truthfully, it takes far too much time and can often make it more difficult to achieve total victory.
[02:09:46.728 --> 02:09:58.517]  Sometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing.
[02:09:59.558 --> 02:10:00.519]  I have done that.
[02:10:11.568 --> 02:10:13.989]  And believe it or not, I regret it.
[02:10:24.031 --> 02:10:24.991]  And I do regret it.
[02:10:25.571 --> 02:10:30.673]  Particularly where it may have caused personal pain.
[02:10:32.433 --> 02:10:36.554]  Too much is at stake for us to be consumed
[02:10:37.392 --> 02:10:38.252]  With these issues.
[02:10:39.072 --> 02:10:41.213]  But one thing I can promise you this.
[02:10:42.373 --> 02:10:45.654]  I will always tell you the truth.
[02:10:51.775 --> 02:11:01.978]  I speak the truth for all of you and for everyone in this country who doesn't have a voice of which there are many.
[02:11:04.921 --> 02:11:12.103]  I speak the truth on behalf of the factory worker who lost his or her job.
[02:11:12.903 --> 02:11:16.684]  And that's happening more and more in our country.
[02:11:17.484 --> 02:11:29.028]  I speak the truth on behalf of the veteran who has been denied the medical care they need and the medical care they deserve.
[02:11:33.309 --> 02:11:34.069]  And so many.
[02:11:35.527 --> 02:11:40.551]  Are not making it, but they're going to make it if Trump becomes president.
[02:11:40.591 --> 02:11:41.432]  That I can tell you.
[02:11:46.656 --> 02:11:49.719]  They are dying on lines waiting for a doctor.
[02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:52.802]  We're going to take care of our veterans.
[02:11:56.411 --> 02:12:12.823]  I speak the truth on behalf of the family living near the border that deserves to be safe in their own country, but is instead living with no security and no protection at all.
[02:12:33.982 --> 02:12:35.443]  We will build the wall.
[02:12:36.704 --> 02:12:37.925]  Believe me, we will build the wall.
[02:12:41.728 --> 02:12:46.891]  Our campaign is about representing the great majority of Americans.
[02:12:47.472 --> 02:13:02.903]  Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Conservatives and Liberals who read the newspaper or turn on the television and don't hear anyone, anyone speaking for them.
[02:13:04.546 --> 02:13:11.089]  All they hear are insiders fighting for other insiders.
[02:13:11.709 --> 02:13:12.509]  That's what they do.
[02:13:14.590 --> 02:13:24.114]  These are the forgotten men and women in our society, and they are angry at so much and on so many levels.
[02:13:28.136 --> 02:13:30.877]  The poverty, the unemployment,
[02:13:31.860 --> 02:13:36.648]  The failing schools, the jobs moving to other countries.
[02:13:37.429 --> 02:13:41.555]  I'm fighting for these forgotten Americans.
[02:13:47.369 --> 02:13:48.250]  What an incredible speech.
[02:13:48.290 --> 02:14:05.804]  I mean, what a novel idea, having a president who's actually for Americans and who says, you know what, sometimes I might put my foot in my mouth, essentially, but I'd rather tell you the truth than, here on the other side, we have people that can't even defend their own candidate because they know she's not trustworthy.
[02:14:05.844 --> 02:14:07.125]  She lies again and again and again.
[02:14:07.825 --> 02:14:09.206]  So let's go to this next clip.
[02:14:09.847 --> 02:14:15.070]  Donald Trump is pointing out the fact that it's due to the reckless decision making by our politicians.
[02:14:16.051 --> 02:14:22.275]  But the reason why this reckless decision making has come about is because they're getting personal profit.
[02:14:22.336 --> 02:14:24.297]  They're gaining from these reckless decisions.
[02:14:25.718 --> 02:14:36.586]  Hillary Clinton's mistakes destroy innocent lives, sacrifice national security, and betray the working families of this country.
[02:14:37.895 --> 02:14:38.916]  Please remember this.
[02:14:40.016 --> 02:14:46.541]  I will never put personal profit before national security.
[02:14:46.881 --> 02:14:47.721]  Nobody should.
[02:14:52.364 --> 02:15:03.351]  I will never leave our border open to appease donors and special interests, which is what Hillary is doing, and they are being appeased.
[02:15:04.412 --> 02:15:05.693]  I will never support
[02:15:06.485 --> 02:15:10.747]  A trade deal that kills American jobs.
[02:15:13.168 --> 02:15:20.410]  I will never ever put the special interests before the national interests.
[02:15:23.731 --> 02:15:30.874]  I will never put a donor before a voter or a lobbyist before a citizen.
[02:15:35.056 --> 02:15:35.676]  Instead,
[02:15:37.037 --> 02:15:38.858]  I will be a champion for the people.
[02:15:40.619 --> 02:15:49.584]  The establishment media doesn't cover what really matters in this country or what's really going on in people's lives.
[02:15:52.446 --> 02:16:05.974]  They will take words of mine out of context and spend a week obsessing over every single syllable and then pretend to discover some hidden meaning in what I said.
[02:16:12.327 --> 02:16:25.971]  Just imagine for a second if the media spent this energy holding the politicians accountable who got innocent Americans like Kate Steinle killed.
[02:16:27.272 --> 02:16:33.634]  She was gunned down by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.
[02:16:35.305 --> 02:16:46.333]  Just imagine if the media spent time, and lots of time, investigating the poverty and joblessness of the inner cities.
[02:16:47.814 --> 02:17:03.184]  Just think about how much different things would be if the media in this country sent their cameras to our border, to our closing factories, or to our failing schools.
[02:17:06.833 --> 02:17:20.443]  Or if the media focused on what dark secrets must be hidden in the 33,000 emails that Hillary Clinton illegally deleted.
[02:17:34.713 --> 02:17:35.113]  Thank you.
[02:17:36.405 --> 02:17:43.633]  Instead, every story is told from the perspective of the insider.
[02:17:44.634 --> 02:17:48.519]  It's the narrative of the people who rigged the system.
[02:17:49.099 --> 02:17:53.164]  Never the voice of the people it's been rigged against.
[02:17:53.684 --> 02:17:54.285]  Believe me.
[02:17:55.306 --> 02:18:00.410]  So many people suffering for so long in silence.
[02:18:01.070 --> 02:18:10.917]  No cameras, no coverage, no outrage from the media class that seems to get outraged over just about everything else.
[02:18:11.897 --> 02:18:14.559]  So again, it's not about me.
[02:18:14.899 --> 02:18:16.140]  It's never been about me.
[02:18:16.580 --> 02:18:21.704]  It's been about all the people in this country who don't have a voice.
[02:18:23.351 --> 02:18:26.414]  I am running to be your voice.
[02:18:39.605 --> 02:18:40.046]  Thank you.
[02:18:40.987 --> 02:18:49.995]  I am running to be the voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better future.
[02:18:51.637 --> 02:19:07.672]  I am glad that I make the powerful, and I mean very powerful, a little uncomfortable now and again, including some of the powerful people, frankly, in my own party.
[02:19:08.353 --> 02:19:17.121]  Because it means that I'm fighting for real change, real change.
[02:19:18.706 --> 02:19:19.707]  That's exactly right.
[02:19:19.767 --> 02:19:23.710]  Real change because we know exactly what we're going to get if Hillary Clinton gets in.
[02:19:23.770 --> 02:19:27.934]  That's Donald Trump saying that he is going to be a champion of the people.
[02:19:28.675 --> 02:19:32.278]  Joe Biggs, what do you think about this speech, best speech of his life?
[02:19:33.298 --> 02:19:33.719]  It's great.
[02:19:33.759 --> 02:19:34.359]  I mean, he really...
[02:19:35.526 --> 02:19:40.932]  Had a good, clear message about what he wants to do, what his vision is, and how he's going to do it.
[02:19:41.312 --> 02:19:53.626]  You know, it's always funny, like, every time I go to these events now, everyone's screaming, build the wall, build the wall, so hopefully he can live up to that one at least, because that seems to be the major one that everyone, major thing everyone wants.
[02:19:53.846 --> 02:19:58.288]  Well, he is a jobs creator, and that would create a lot of jobs building that wall.
[02:19:58.308 --> 02:19:59.309]  They're already building bricks.
[02:19:59.469 --> 02:20:04.671]  And latest polls show that most immigrants actually back Trump on this ideological test.
[02:20:04.811 --> 02:20:06.012]  So we'll see what happens.
[02:20:06.372 --> 02:20:06.932]  All right, stick around.
[02:20:06.952 --> 02:20:09.373]  We're going to be breaking down more of Donald Trump's speech.
[02:20:16.477 --> 02:20:20.959]  Hillary Clinton is desperate.
[02:20:21.912 --> 02:20:29.839]  Donald Trump was 10 points ahead in the polls until Reuters and others began sampling 10 to 15 percent more Democrats in their polls to skew the numbers.
[02:20:30.160 --> 02:20:30.700]  It's incredible.
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:40.189]  But despite all that skewing in the last two weeks, now in major polls, put up with the very same groups, with the same methodology, Trump is neck and neck with her, or even a point or two ahead.
[02:20:40.709 --> 02:20:46.134]  But if you go look at the social media, and Breitbart and Gateway Pundit have done this, it's incredible.
[02:20:46.835 --> 02:20:56.162]  We're talking three, four, five, six times the support at places like Facebook, Livestream, Reddit, and so many other places.
[02:20:56.402 --> 02:21:00.285]  In fact, sometimes he's got ten times more likes and ten times more views.
[02:21:00.926 --> 02:21:04.709]  That's what we saw with Bernie Sanders, where he'd have 20,000 people, Hillary'd have 500.
[02:21:05.509 --> 02:21:14.136]  We did exit polls in California and other so-called battleground states in the Democratic primary, and we talked to eight people before we found one or two Hillary supporters.
[02:21:14.696 --> 02:21:17.917]  That's why Hillary was forced to steal it with the superdelegates.
[02:21:18.578 --> 02:21:20.178]  Let's look at some of the numbers themselves.
[02:21:21.099 --> 02:21:25.981]  Trump had 10 million plus likes to Clinton's 5 million on Facebook.
[02:21:26.361 --> 02:21:34.164]  And that's with Facebook admittedly censoring Trump pages everywhere they can and even meeting with Hillary Clinton just like Google does.
[02:21:35.123 --> 02:21:42.967]  Trump averages 30,000 live viewers per stream, and Clinton averages 500 live stream viewers per stream.
[02:21:43.407 --> 02:21:47.789]  On Reddit, Trump averages 197,000 plus subscribers, Hillary 24,000.
[02:21:48.269 --> 02:21:52.712]  Hillary for prison has 55,000 subscribers.
[02:21:52.992 --> 02:21:54.252]  Gee, wonder who started that.
[02:21:54.873 --> 02:21:58.855]  And this is only a snapshot of the numbers we're seeing with Trump.
[02:21:59.295 --> 02:22:02.817]  You go to YouTube, his average video has millions of views.
[02:22:03.877 --> 02:22:06.279]  You go look at Hillary's official campaign site.
[02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:08.761]  Most of her videos have 2,000 or 3,000 views.
[02:22:08.801 --> 02:22:10.262]  Her bigger one's a few hundred thousand.
[02:22:10.603 --> 02:22:11.764]  This lady's a joke.
[02:22:12.164 --> 02:22:13.485]  She's not liked by her own party.
[02:22:13.805 --> 02:22:20.471]  But we're being told it's going to be a landslide for her because they're trying to get us ready for election fraud.
[02:22:20.871 --> 02:22:23.994]  Something so well documented in this country's past.
[02:22:25.195 --> 02:22:27.236]  But Obama says it's preposterous.
[02:22:27.597 --> 02:22:29.518]  He doesn't even know what that is.
[02:22:30.299 --> 02:22:32.241]  Well, President Obama, we do know what it is.
[02:22:33.055 --> 02:22:38.938]  And this time, we don't have somebody like Mitt Romney or John McCain who's gonna stand down and not take action.
[02:22:39.238 --> 02:22:41.399]  We don't have somebody who's gonna throw in the towel there's fraud.
[02:22:41.659 --> 02:22:45.941]  We've got Donald Trump and an awake population that's aware of your scams.
[02:22:47.002 --> 02:22:48.643]  The social engineers have jumped the shark.
[02:22:49.083 --> 02:22:51.084]  They are stealing this election in front of everyone.
[02:22:51.984 --> 02:22:55.786]  By forcing them to engage in fraud, we are exposing them forever.
[02:22:56.127 --> 02:23:00.749]  So even if Donald Trump loses, even if that happens due to fraud,
[02:23:01.721 --> 02:23:02.261]  Or scandals.
[02:23:02.661 --> 02:23:08.003]  It doesn't matter because we've been in the arena, we've politically exposed the system, political correctness, globalism.
[02:23:08.423 --> 02:23:09.684]  The maxim has been introduced.
[02:23:10.024 --> 02:23:11.484]  Americanism, not globalism.
[02:23:12.285 --> 02:23:14.345]  This is a good time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:23:14.726 --> 02:23:20.788]  And we owe Donald Trump so much for being willing to put his family, his life, his treasure on the line.
[02:23:21.188 --> 02:23:22.428]  He is the man in the arena.
[02:23:23.009 --> 02:23:24.789]  And I'm honored to be in that arena with him as well.
[02:23:25.269 --> 02:23:29.831]  If you haven't joined us in this historic fight, it's time to pick a side right now.
[02:23:40.407 --> 02:23:42.048]  Our talk show host is Alex Jones.
[02:23:42.108 --> 02:23:43.989]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:23:44.070 --> 02:23:46.791]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[02:23:46.992 --> 02:23:47.812]  Alex Jones.
[02:23:47.892 --> 02:23:50.654]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:23:50.714 --> 02:23:53.936]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:23:53.956 --> 02:23:55.277]  Deeply I think racist.
[02:23:55.377 --> 02:23:57.198]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[02:23:57.319 --> 02:23:59.120]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[02:23:59.140 --> 02:24:03.223]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[02:24:03.243 --> 02:24:04.403]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:04.463 --> 02:24:09.387]  Watch the free stream live at inforce.com forward slash show.
[02:24:11.104 --> 02:24:13.867]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:24:14.427 --> 02:24:17.711]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:23.178 --> 02:24:25.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:25.220 --> 02:24:28.142]  I am Leanne McAdoo joined by Joe Biggs.
[02:24:28.202 --> 02:24:36.228]  Now Biggs, I wanted to get your opinion on a specific part of Donald Trump's speech where he's talking about our children here in America.
[02:24:36.368 --> 02:24:38.249]  Let our children be dreamers too.
[02:24:38.650 --> 02:24:40.211]  So here is a portion of that speech.
[02:24:40.711 --> 02:24:44.294]  He said, it's the fight of our lives together to save our country.
[02:24:44.814 --> 02:24:51.176]  I refuse to let another generation of American children be excluded from the American dream, which is what's happening.
[02:24:51.476 --> 02:25:01.959]  Our whole country loses when young people of limitless potential are denied the opportunity to contribute their talents because we failed to provide them the opportunities that they deserve.
[02:25:02.380 --> 02:25:04.760]  Let our children be dreamers too.
[02:25:05.341 --> 02:25:06.661]  So Biggs, what do you think about that?
[02:25:06.681 --> 02:25:12.223]  I mean, you've been there on the ground, you've seen in Ferguson, just recently getting back from Milwaukee, a lot of
[02:25:13.752 --> 02:25:27.479]  People are blaming this on systemic racism only, ignoring the fact that a lot of these cities where we're seeing this unrest sort of festering up are cities that have been run by Democrats and these progressive policies for decades.
[02:25:27.499 --> 02:25:29.480]  It's a Democratic plantation.
[02:25:30.527 --> 02:25:32.148]  It's ridiculous.
[02:25:32.208 --> 02:25:52.944]  I mean, you go to these different places and you get on the ground, and you see so many Americans who actually need help, but they've been stuck in this, imprisoned in this camp, this democratic system for so long, and they're so dependent on big government, which creates people who don't go out.
[02:25:52.984 --> 02:25:53.905]  They're not entrepreneurs.
[02:25:53.925 --> 02:25:55.626]  They're not going out and creating things.
[02:25:56.306 --> 02:25:57.908]  They're just so dependent, staying home.
[02:25:57.948 --> 02:25:59.349]  They want the government to take care of them.
[02:26:00.069 --> 02:26:01.731]  And it's sad to see that, you know.
[02:26:01.851 --> 02:26:09.538]  For once, I'd like to see some of these cities like Chicago, you know, Milwaukee, El Paso, a lot of these places are Democrat-run.
[02:26:10.338 --> 02:26:10.859]  Switch it up!
[02:26:11.159 --> 02:26:18.105]  See how it works out, because right now the top seven worst cities in America are Democrat-run.
[02:26:18.866 --> 02:26:19.707]  We're good to go.
[02:26:39.525 --> 02:26:42.107]  Right, no other way to feed their families sometimes.
[02:26:42.408 --> 02:26:47.693]  And it's really interesting watching the liberal media reporting on these stories.
[02:26:48.273 --> 02:26:50.075]  And they have to make it about race.
[02:26:50.115 --> 02:27:01.305]  They have to make it about the divide and conquer because there's no way they can draw attention to the fact that it's actually these liberal policies that are so disruptive for these communities and actually holding people back.
[02:27:01.365 --> 02:27:04.949]  I mean, I think how little I really knew about politics, I wasn't
[02:27:05.549 --> 02:27:06.049]  I don't know.
[02:27:19.261 --> 02:27:20.181]  Yeah, I mean, there's great people.
[02:27:20.201 --> 02:27:27.505]  I mean, before we went out to Milwaukee, there was reports, you know, of reporters pulling out because the racism was so bad.
[02:27:27.545 --> 02:27:30.807]  I mean, we got out there and walked around and people were nice, came up to us.
[02:27:30.827 --> 02:27:40.471]  People just wanted you to talk to them and not judge them and not come in there with some, you know, mindset that they're going to act like a certain way and that you're going to be a little apprehensive and scared.
[02:27:40.491 --> 02:27:48.035]  If you come in there and you talk to these people and you engage in a great conversation, we had a guy come up to us and we were talking about, you know, why do you think
[02:27:48.635 --> 02:27:51.518]  That Milwaukee is one of the poorest cities.
[02:27:51.558 --> 02:27:53.700]  Why do you think it's one of the worst cities in America?
[02:27:54.020 --> 02:27:56.263]  And the guy's going, well, it's because of the Democrat Party.
[02:27:56.283 --> 02:27:58.185]  And it's like, people are born into this whole system.
[02:27:58.205 --> 02:28:01.208]  And he said they just keep voting that way because that's the way their family did it.
[02:28:01.548 --> 02:28:03.270]  And then their kids do it and their kids do it.
[02:28:03.290 --> 02:28:05.171]  And it just continues and continues to go on.
[02:28:05.532 --> 02:28:07.294]  But Trump's speech right here, I like it.
[02:28:07.434 --> 02:28:11.778]  It really highlights his whole slogan, America First, because, you know,
[02:28:12.979 --> 02:28:22.524]  Why is it that we have so many young Americans struggling to survive, to pay off these debts, to do all this stuff, meanwhile, someone can come in from another country...
[02:28:23.618 --> 02:28:29.463]  And can bypass all that stuff, get free school, get free healthcare, get all this stuff, a free bus ticket to go somewhere.
[02:28:30.024 --> 02:28:33.347]  Meanwhile, we have people who are struggling on a daily basis.
[02:28:33.907 --> 02:28:43.116]  That's why I like Trump's slogan, America First, because we need to take care of every man, woman, and child here that's living here, who's doing the right thing.
[02:28:44.157 --> 02:28:45.178]  That's what we need to focus on.
[02:28:45.802 --> 02:28:58.458]  Right and of course a lot of these people can begin to see how when you bring in a whole illegal class of people that are going to be taking their jobs that they're already struggling to get those jobs.
[02:28:58.758 --> 02:29:03.524]  I mean it's only going to get worse for these communities and so I think that they're really starting to wake up
[02:29:03.664 --> 02:29:03.945]  I think so.
[02:29:20.487 --> 02:29:25.472]  Now, when we come back, we are going to be playing a special report from John Bowne.
[02:29:25.532 --> 02:29:31.318]  He is basically going to provide us with a stunning recap of the failed Obama presidency.
[02:29:32.059 --> 02:29:37.084]  Obama, you know, he's got one more little thing that he's got to do before he leaves office.
[02:29:37.124 --> 02:29:40.527]  He's going to hand over American control of the Internet.
[02:29:40.647 --> 02:29:44.271]  We've seen his failures before with Obamacare, open borders.
[02:29:44.751 --> 02:29:48.253]  So just totally stunning as he leaves the office.
[02:29:48.273 --> 02:29:52.936]  So that report will be coming back and then more with myself and Joe Biggs.
[02:29:53.557 --> 02:29:56.759]  We've got all of the breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[02:29:59.381 --> 02:30:00.281]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.781 --> 02:30:02.362]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.382 --> 02:30:06.025]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.941 --> 02:30:16.104]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:30:16.484 --> 02:30:19.366]  Dr. Group, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:30:19.706 --> 02:30:24.908]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:30:25.328 --> 02:30:31.291]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:30:31.431 --> 02:30:34.553]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:30:34.833 --> 02:30:36.174]  When it runs out, you start dying.
[02:30:36.374 --> 02:30:40.516]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:30:40.716 --> 02:30:43.577]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:30:43.657 --> 02:30:45.218]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:30:45.318 --> 02:30:48.539]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:30:48.779 --> 02:30:51.100]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:30:51.380 --> 02:30:52.341]  It's in powder form.
[02:30:52.441 --> 02:30:55.142]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[02:30:55.322 --> 02:30:55.922]  I take this.
[02:30:56.042 --> 02:30:57.723]  This is the product that I take.

[02:31:14.310 --> 02:31:20.092]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand-new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:31:20.313 --> 02:31:26.035]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:31:26.215 --> 02:31:43.079]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.

[02:32:09.631 --> 02:32:11.572]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[02:32:11.693 --> 02:32:12.013]  Poll.
[02:32:12.253 --> 02:32:17.277]  Jill Stein tied with dead gorilla Harambe trailing these nuts in Texas.
[02:32:17.497 --> 02:32:18.598]  Article up by the hill.
[02:32:18.758 --> 02:32:23.781]  Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein is tied with Harambe.
[02:32:23.881 --> 02:32:28.785]  The gorilla killed in a Cincinnati zoo in May in a new poll of Texas voters.
[02:32:28.985 --> 02:32:37.788]  Public Policy Polling released a survey on Tuesday which showed only 2% would vote for Stein, the same percentage that support Harambe.
[02:32:37.888 --> 02:32:42.590]  This is the second time PPP has polled support for the dead gorilla.
[02:32:42.750 --> 02:32:43.711]  At the end of July, PPP
[02:32:44.531 --> 02:32:49.154]  Tweeted the results of a poll that had Stein at 2% support and Harambe at 5%.
[02:32:50.515 --> 02:32:58.181]  Tuesday's polls also have Stein trailing Deez Nuts, the fictitional politician who has the support of 3% of voters.
[02:32:58.381 --> 02:33:05.827]  Deez Nuts, who filed with the Federal Election Commission to run for president in 2016, is a 15-year-old Iowan Brady Olson.
[02:33:05.967 --> 02:33:08.869]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[02:33:12.731 --> 02:33:13.732]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:13.853 --> 02:33:16.076]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:24.572 --> 02:33:28.314]  What has President Obama done with two terms as our Commander-in-Chief?
[02:33:28.554 --> 02:33:29.474]  Fix the economy?
[02:33:29.695 --> 02:33:29.895]  Nope.
[02:33:30.075 --> 02:33:35.137]  The national debt went from $10.6 trillion to $19.5 trillion under his watch.
[02:33:35.457 --> 02:33:40.720]  And Obama is the only president in history to not see a 3% increase in the GDP.
[02:33:40.860 --> 02:33:43.441]  Healed division as the first black president?
[02:33:43.641 --> 02:33:43.881]  Nope.
[02:33:44.121 --> 02:34:00.492]  America is sitting on a powder keg of anarchy as a result of the Lenski-ite methods unleashed by the White House and its lapdog media and the hordes of communists and faux civil rights movements under the umbrella of Black Lives Matter attacking their own communities.
[02:34:00.772 --> 02:34:01.973]  Kept America safe?
[02:34:02.393 --> 02:34:02.674]  Oh no.
[02:34:02.854 --> 02:34:12.380]  The United States just surpassed Europe in the admittance of Muslim refugees, 21% of which that will stop at nothing to foment jihad in our communities.
[02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:22.084]  As Orlando, San Bernardino and 9-11 cast a dark shadow over national security, and Europe's example serves as a harsh warning for the very near future.
[02:34:22.344 --> 02:34:23.485]  Is it getting clearer?
[02:34:23.785 --> 02:34:31.248]  President Obama's achievements don't involve you, the average US citizen, be you on the left or the right or in the middle.
[02:34:31.388 --> 02:34:35.130]  His achievements are applauded by foreign bankers and oligarchs.
[02:34:35.230 --> 02:34:41.614]  Whose agenda reads like an instruction manual of the legacy of our 44th President of the United States.
[02:34:41.994 --> 02:34:44.295]  Obama came up big on one of his promises.
[02:34:44.495 --> 02:34:46.596]  He managed to bankrupt the coal industry.
[02:34:46.856 --> 02:34:51.339]  A huge boon to the natural gas industry fracking its way across America.
[02:34:51.539 --> 02:34:57.661]  As oil and gas production has doubled over the past five years, the number of earthquakes rattling Oklahoma has surged.
[02:34:58.122 --> 02:35:03.684]  Until 2008, the state averaged one to two quakes, magnitude three or greater, per year.
[02:35:03.784 --> 02:35:06.005]  In 2015, it's averaged two per day.
[02:35:06.065 --> 02:35:11.267]  The coal industry has been devastated by nearly 30% since Obama took office.
[02:35:11.367 --> 02:35:19.530]  The Daily Caller reports, coal use fell in every state but Nebraska and Alaska, devastating both the coal power and the coal mining industries.
[02:35:19.750 --> 02:35:26.194]  And even forcing Peabody Energy, the world's largest coal company, to declare bankruptcy, jobs hemorrhaged.
[02:35:26.394 --> 02:35:34.339]  Under the hugely unpopular Corporocratic Congress Obama presided over, China has been devastating our manufacturing base since 2001.
[02:35:35.640 --> 02:35:38.402]  Fifteen years later, nothing has been done to counter it.
[02:35:38.542 --> 02:35:42.084]  In fact, everything has been done to open the gaping wound.
[02:35:42.264 --> 02:35:48.168]  John Rappaport of No More Fake News writes, Obama is the Rockefeller globalist man in the White House.
[02:35:48.368 --> 02:35:49.129]  He's tasked
[02:35:49.469 --> 02:35:53.912]  With pushing through congressional ratification of the TPP come hell or high water.
[02:35:54.152 --> 02:36:09.544]  First, know that the TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, is a huge globalist trade deal among 12 nations that would phase out thousands of tariffs and set up corporate tribunals to punish nations that refuse to import goods, e.g.
[02:36:09.684 --> 02:36:14.007]  toxic pesticides, toxic medical drugs, GMOs, etc.
[02:36:14.227 --> 02:36:15.508]  In short, it's a nightmare.
[02:36:15.788 --> 02:36:19.012]  Wiping out tariffs is the cornerstone of the globalist agenda.
[02:36:19.212 --> 02:36:34.771]  It allows companies in industrial countries to move their factories to third world hell holes, pay slave wages, ignore environmental conditions, and then export their products back to the countries they abandoned with no tariffs, no taxes, no penalties.
[02:36:35.131 --> 02:36:46.056]  Meanwhile, White House mouthpiece Politico nonchalantly reports President Barack Obama is taking the fight for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal to America's streets.
[02:36:46.356 --> 02:36:57.881]  The White House is making an all-out push to win passage of the deal in the lame-duck session of Congress, organizing 30 events over the congressional recess to gin up support for the agreement.
[02:36:58.061 --> 02:37:00.042]  If that isn't brainwashing, I don't know what is.
[02:37:00.402 --> 02:37:20.394]  Simultaneously, Obama's Department of Commerce is handing over the reins of the Internet in October to a multinational authority that includes China, Russia, and Iran as an olive branch of Obama's failed foreign policy after the NSA had been discovered spying on world leaders, which more than likely was the ploy all along.
[02:37:20.594 --> 02:37:22.735]  Globalism is here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:37:22.955 --> 02:37:34.010]  Your very existence and that of your descendants is at stake as Obama sets up to throw a Hail Mary of treason in the final minutes of his new world order presidency.
[02:37:34.250 --> 02:37:35.672]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[02:37:42.552 --> 02:37:45.374]  Alright, well that was another excellent report from John Bowne.
[02:37:45.534 --> 02:37:47.755]  I am Leah McAdoo here with Joe Biggs.
[02:37:47.795 --> 02:37:55.899]  Now Joe, if you would look at any of the mainstream media out there, they're not going to be giving you the kind of information that John Bowne was just delivering with that report.
[02:37:55.939 --> 02:37:59.581]  They are only telling people about the Olympic swimmers.
[02:37:59.681 --> 02:38:00.602]  That's the big news.
[02:38:02.048 --> 02:38:03.108]  Ryan Lockegate.
[02:38:04.649 --> 02:38:13.952]  Like the biggest story in the world right now is how an Olympic swimmer lied about being mugged and everyone's covering about how this guy's a liar and can't be trusted anymore.
[02:38:14.372 --> 02:38:15.513]  Hello, does that sound familiar?
[02:38:15.533 --> 02:38:17.573]  We've been saying that about Hillary Clinton for how long?
[02:38:18.554 --> 02:38:20.154]  And the media, you won't cover that.
[02:38:20.214 --> 02:38:22.515]  You won't cover this goon right here.
[02:38:25.509 --> 02:38:27.510]  You don't want to cover Hillary Clinton right now.
[02:38:27.650 --> 02:38:28.251]  At all.
[02:38:28.571 --> 02:38:29.791]  What difference does it make?
[02:38:29.912 --> 02:38:31.472]  She lies about everything.
[02:38:31.512 --> 02:38:39.997]  The new WikiLeaks document shows that she was helping send weapons to Libya and stuff and all these different places.
[02:38:40.037 --> 02:38:40.878]  All this stuff's coming out.
[02:38:41.178 --> 02:38:41.978]  But no one cares.
[02:38:42.038 --> 02:38:43.079]  No one's even talking about it.
[02:38:43.499 --> 02:38:51.344]  These WikiLeaks come out on Twitter and it trends for like 10 minutes and then they go in and take it down really quick and then they put in like
[02:38:51.764 --> 02:38:55.905]  You know, Beyonce's, you know, new booty shaking video that I can care less about.
[02:38:56.385 --> 02:38:57.666]  I want to know about Hillary Clinton.
[02:38:57.686 --> 02:38:59.046]  I want them to do their job.
[02:38:59.066 --> 02:39:02.047]  I don't want to hear about Ryan Lochte swimming in a green pool.
[02:39:02.067 --> 02:39:03.227]  I care less about that.
[02:39:03.247 --> 02:39:04.367]  I don't care if he got mugged.
[02:39:04.807 --> 02:39:05.087]  Yeah.
[02:39:05.268 --> 02:39:06.408]  I don't care.
[02:39:06.488 --> 02:39:08.088]  I don't care if he stole a donut.
[02:39:08.188 --> 02:39:09.869]  Now we just know he's like a drunk.
[02:39:09.909 --> 02:39:13.870]  He broke a mirror in a bathroom that was equivalent to 20 US dollars.
[02:39:14.310 --> 02:39:14.910]  Oh my God.
[02:39:15.370 --> 02:39:18.631]  I mean, hey, at the end of the day, at least he didn't burn down the gas station, I guess afterwards.
[02:39:18.891 --> 02:39:20.452]  Yeah, well, and that's just it.
[02:39:20.492 --> 02:39:25.894]  It's like there is so much going on that they want to distract you with the Olympics.
[02:39:26.254 --> 02:39:37.779]  Of course, it's perfect timing for the Olympics and all that coverage, but they don't want to talk about the fact that Clinton Foundation donations have been linked to State Department favors.
[02:39:38.159 --> 02:39:42.301]  We're going to be speaking with our investigative reporter Wayne Madsen here in just a minute.
[02:39:42.341 --> 02:39:43.662]  He's got this really incredible
[02:39:44.162 --> 02:39:59.319]  Report he also gets into the details about how George Soros has been linked now to the Muslim takeover of the West But these this is not the kind of news that you're gonna be get by watching the main slot Lockheed's like the new Harambe war Lockheed Ryan Lockheed's like the new Harambe
[02:40:00.200 --> 02:40:07.165]  Which Harambe is beating Jill Stein in Texas right now, a dead gorilla, and Deez Nuts.
[02:40:07.265 --> 02:40:08.846]  So there you go, that's America today.
[02:40:08.866 --> 02:40:09.927]  That's what's going on right now.
[02:40:09.947 --> 02:40:15.151]  They're also going to distract you letting you believe that these people, even Harambe, vote for Harambe.
[02:40:16.131 --> 02:40:18.992]  You know, as if your votes don't count, they don't matter.
[02:40:19.052 --> 02:40:23.573]  That dead gorilla has more of a... He's got a better personality than Gary Johnson.
[02:40:23.833 --> 02:40:24.613]  In this election.
[02:40:24.954 --> 02:40:29.675]  Well, I want to draw everyone's attention to our sale that we are having right now for a limited time.

[02:41:07.994 --> 02:41:20.587]  I know myself and Joe Biggs are probably really due for one of these living defense cleanses because both of us are avid consumers of sushi, which I love sushi, but man, I don't even want to think about
[02:41:21.087 --> 02:41:23.350]  I just tried brain force for the first time the other day.
[02:41:23.410 --> 02:41:24.230]  Wow, that really works.

[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:39.727]  I don't know how Trump does it, but it just finally hit me and I just kind of like, my whole body stopped and I was like, I've just got to go to sleep right now.
[02:41:40.287 --> 02:41:43.230]  But I couldn't because I still had to work, so I popped one of those things in and

[02:42:24.601 --> 02:42:25.581]  Assemble!
[02:42:25.921 --> 02:42:34.227]  So we've got Wayne Madsen now joining us, bringing some really great reporting, exposing what the mainstream media daren't tell us
[02:42:34.807 --> 02:42:47.161]  About the Clinton Foundation, and I really feel like getting this information out there, Wayne, is going to force them to have to see this pay-to-play slush fund operation that the Clintons have set up.
[02:42:47.241 --> 02:42:48.963]  So tell us about your latest report.
[02:42:49.758 --> 02:43:09.967]  Well, I'm not sure there's a cause and effect relationship here, but I would note that just a few days after, maybe two days after, I published this list of key foreign nations and key foreign corporations that had donated to the Clinton Foundation and its various other contrivances.
[02:43:10.747 --> 02:43:14.229]  And then I showed what those entities received
[02:43:15.069 --> 02:43:31.085]  In return, as a way of favors from the State Department, it was just announced yesterday that the Clinton Foundation will cease accepting foreign and corporate donations
[02:43:32.206 --> 02:43:33.007]  I don't think so.
[02:43:49.216 --> 02:43:51.238]  I saw that when I was reading through Drudge.
[02:43:51.278 --> 02:43:52.018]  I was like, really?
[02:43:52.039 --> 02:43:54.180]  I was like, you guys already said that once and that failed miserably.
[02:43:54.200 --> 02:43:55.982]  So you expect me to believe this all over again?
[02:43:56.002 --> 02:43:56.222]  Come on.
[02:44:07.111 --> 02:44:15.297]  And we are definitely driving the narrative there now, and Wayne, with this chart that you have really laid it out.
[02:44:15.377 --> 02:44:16.558]  There's no denying it.
[02:44:16.618 --> 02:44:26.265]  You can go to InfoWars.com and look at Wayne Madsen's really great article, a chart, Clinton Foundation donations linked to State Department favors, and you spell it out.
[02:44:26.365 --> 02:44:27.806]  It's right there in black and white.
[02:44:28.086 --> 02:44:34.691]  For anyone who doesn't have the time to go through all of these additional private emails that have been released,
[02:44:35.451 --> 02:44:42.415]  Prince Abu Dhabi and Foreign Minister of the United Arab Emirates Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
[02:44:43.296 --> 02:44:48.539]  They donate $5 million so they get access to Hillary Rodham Clinton at the State Department.
[02:44:48.559 --> 02:44:53.702]  $500,000 environmental speech by Bill Clinton given at the Emirates Palace Hotel.
[02:44:54.342 --> 02:44:55.763]  State clearance for U.S.
[02:44:55.943 --> 02:44:58.685]  arms sales to Algeria there with their donation.
[02:44:59.005 --> 02:45:01.046]  I mean it just goes on and on and on.
[02:45:02.387 --> 02:45:09.149]  So what do you think people really need to understand about, let's say, the Tenio Holdings firm, for instance?
[02:45:09.709 --> 02:45:28.935]  Well, Tenio is very problematic because the guy who founded this Tenio, which is a lobbyist slash investment firm slash private intelligence company with offices in New York, London and elsewhere around the world.
[02:45:29.415 --> 02:45:36.182]  It was started by Doug Band, who had been Bill Clinton's personal aide after Clinton left office.
[02:45:37.363 --> 02:45:41.787]  So he is very much part of this Clinton Foundation infrastructure.
[02:45:41.807 --> 02:45:52.458]  Huma Abedin was basically double dipping, getting a State Department salary as Hillary Clinton's personal assistant, while she was also drawing a paycheck
[02:45:52.918 --> 02:45:55.139]  From Tennio Holdings in New York.
[02:45:55.219 --> 02:46:06.145]  So, we have this interlocking situation between the Clinton Foundation, Mrs. Clinton at the State Department, and this private entity, Tennio Holdings.
[02:46:06.205 --> 02:46:14.889]  Now, I compiled that list from open source information, from emails that have been released, other information.
[02:46:15.590 --> 02:46:19.111]  Some of it had been hacked into and released.
[02:46:19.652 --> 02:46:21.693]  Some of it was in some news reports, but
[02:46:22.853 --> 02:46:44.942]  If I could get that from open source, I just wonder what the National Security Agency's finance and commerce branch has in the way of very incriminating information on the racketeering that was obviously going on, the pay-to-play scheme run by the Clintons when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.
[02:46:46.343 --> 02:46:48.644]  If I could get that much from open source, I just
[02:46:49.144 --> 02:46:58.829]  I have to think that the NSA finance and commerce operation, which tracks people too, they follow the money and they follow the people.
[02:46:59.269 --> 02:47:05.572]  They must have quite an interesting database of Clinton Foundation activities.
[02:47:05.973 --> 02:47:08.374]  The problem is that we've seen key intelligence
[02:47:08.974 --> 02:47:13.595]  Officers, uh, retired, uh, come out and support Hillary Clinton.
[02:47:13.735 --> 02:47:16.776]  Mike Morrell, the former acting director of the CIA.
[02:47:17.376 --> 02:47:23.378]  Uh, we've had Michael Hayden, the former NSA and CIA director, say nice things about Clinton.
[02:47:23.398 --> 02:47:27.439]  He's actually showing up on a, on a Clinton ad right now on television.
[02:47:27.459 --> 02:47:36.802]  Um, and, um, so, um, we got to think that the intelligence agencies are supporting, uh, the Clintons.
[02:47:37.685 --> 02:47:47.287]  Absolutely, and as Donald Trump pointed out in his speech, that reckless decision-making by the politicians has often come about due to personal profit.
[02:47:47.707 --> 02:47:53.428]  It's not just here in our own country, but this pay-to-play, it's also affecting people in other countries.
[02:47:53.488 --> 02:47:56.249]  Perfect example, you point out here, Walmart Inc.
[02:47:56.729 --> 02:48:04.531]  donated $5 million, and in return, Clinton pressured the Indian government to open up India to Walmart.
[02:48:05.151 --> 02:48:09.394]  Which this was an action that was opposed by India's small retailers.
[02:48:09.774 --> 02:48:20.341]  So here you have people they know, just like here in our country, these small businesses, these mom-and-pop shops, they get pushed out and shut down as soon as one of these big Walmart retailers comes in.
[02:48:21.042 --> 02:48:29.828]  We've also seen Haiti and how the people there in Haiti are very upset with the way the Clintons did or did not failed to help them there.
[02:48:29.908 --> 02:48:34.571]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton's brother gets access to a gold mine there in Haiti.
[02:48:35.471 --> 02:48:50.425]  Yeah, the Clintons have, it's one of the worst things they've done is they've used Haiti, which has been devastated by an earthquake, by repeated hurricanes, by political upheaval.
[02:48:50.745 --> 02:48:53.708]  The Clintons have used Haiti as their personal cash cow.
[02:48:54.148 --> 02:48:54.829]  The poorest
[02:48:55.029 --> 02:48:55.470]  I don't know.
[02:49:12.669 --> 02:49:15.670]  Haiti used to be a net exporter of rice, for example.
[02:49:16.050 --> 02:49:20.312]  It's now an importer of this awful, bleached rice from Arkansas.
[02:49:20.432 --> 02:49:20.732]  Why?
[02:49:20.812 --> 02:49:27.154]  Because the Arkansas Rice Growers Association has been longtime contributors to the Clintons.
[02:49:27.274 --> 02:49:33.797]  Both Governor Bill Clinton and his presidential campaigns, and then Hillary Clinton and her presidential campaigns.
[02:49:34.577 --> 02:49:36.339]  Happened with Haiti's rice industry.
[02:49:36.680 --> 02:49:37.561]  It was destroyed.
[02:49:37.901 --> 02:49:41.006]  Now they have to import this cheap Arkansas crap.
[02:49:41.847 --> 02:49:43.609]  It's not nutritional whatsoever.
[02:49:43.709 --> 02:49:45.251]  It's almost like frankenfood.
[02:49:45.692 --> 02:49:47.514]  It's genetically modified.
[02:49:47.534 --> 02:49:48.255]  Look at Bill Clinton.
[02:49:48.315 --> 02:49:50.278]  I mean, obviously there's something going on with the rice there.
[02:49:51.581 --> 02:49:53.883]  Yeah, I think he's got his soul sucked out of him though.
[02:49:54.224 --> 02:50:05.115]  Yeah, yeah, so we went and not only had problems with, you know, Condoleezza Rice and now Susan Rice, our National Security Advisor, but major problems for Haiti with Arkansas Rice.
[02:50:06.192 --> 02:50:11.936]  Yeah, and people are really beginning to hold them to what they said that they were going to do, helping these countries.
[02:50:11.976 --> 02:50:15.379]  I mean, Haiti, more than 100,000 people died there.
[02:50:15.439 --> 02:50:18.401]  So many people still are living in tents.
[02:50:18.801 --> 02:50:23.464]  What did they do with all this money besides enrich themselves, enrich their own family members?
[02:50:23.824 --> 02:50:26.186]  And they don't want us to ask these questions.
[02:50:26.566 --> 02:50:31.130]  Now, Wayne Madsen, when we get back, I want to ask you, you know, what do you think is the key
[02:50:31.970 --> 02:50:38.836]  The key thing that people should take out of this list, what do you really see is a really damaging sort of pay-to-play action here.
[02:50:39.137 --> 02:50:50.107]  And then we're also going to get into the George Soros story and how Soros was giving global grants to fund these Muslim migrants, this takeover of the West.
[02:50:50.207 --> 02:50:54.711]  I mean, he has got his claws in so deep here with all of this.
[02:50:55.171 --> 02:50:56.554]  So Wayne Madsen, stick around.
[02:50:56.574 --> 02:51:01.524]  We're going to get to that and you're going to find all the breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[02:51:01.584 --> 02:51:01.945]  Stick around.
[02:51:01.985 --> 02:51:02.566]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:14.426 --> 02:51:21.871]  On July 30th, Alex Jones made a request that Donald Trump make rigged elections one of the central campaign issues.
[02:51:22.611 --> 02:51:27.954]  On August 1st, Donald Trump went on Sean Hannity and spoke with Sean about rigged elections.
[02:51:28.775 --> 02:51:35.219]  Vladimir Putin came out a few days later and spoke about how American elections have been rigged in the past.
[02:51:35.819 --> 02:51:37.420]  Here's a recap of those events.
[02:51:38.041 --> 02:51:41.083]  Mr. Trump, I'm not going to lay things out here that you don't already know.
[02:51:42.023 --> 02:51:54.935]  But I am going to ask you to seriously think about making the issue of Hillary's election fraud in the primaries one of the central issues to defeating her in November.
[02:51:55.295 --> 02:51:59.319]  And I'm telling you, November 8th, we better be careful because that election's gonna be rigged.
[02:51:59.459 --> 02:52:00.240]  First of all, it's rigged.
[02:52:00.780 --> 02:52:03.362]  And I'm afraid the election's gonna be rigged, I have to be honest.
[02:52:03.983 --> 02:52:07.766]  And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's gonna be taken away from us.
[02:52:07.926 --> 02:52:11.469]  America teaches everybody how to live in, quote, democracy.
[02:52:11.909 --> 02:52:12.369]  But what?
[02:52:12.770 --> 02:52:15.732]  You actually believe that they have democratic elections there?
[02:52:16.092 --> 02:52:24.319]  If Hillary steals the nomination, and then she openly is engaged in chicanery and things don't add up with Trump, you have to say it must be thrown out.
[02:52:24.819 --> 02:52:33.504]  Hillary Clinton has had every advantage, every break given to her from the very beginning by this Democratic Party.
[02:52:33.604 --> 02:52:34.544]  It has been rigged.
[02:52:34.584 --> 02:52:39.847]  The political parties choose their nominee, not the general public, contrary to popular belief.
[02:52:40.107 --> 02:52:41.748]  Then why are they holding the primaries?
[02:52:42.739 --> 02:52:43.940]  That's a very good question.
[02:52:44.100 --> 02:52:58.348]  It is clearly the case that when given truth serum, Debbie Wasserman Schultz vastly prefers Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, obviously, and to the extent there are things that can be done institutionally and marginally to facilitate that outcome, they are being done.
[02:52:58.449 --> 02:53:03.412]  When did the press see it as their role to protect the prerogative of the powerful?
[02:53:03.472 --> 02:53:04.072]  Actually, I think that's
[02:53:04.713 --> 02:53:08.440]  And we're not going to recognize Queen Hillary if there's evidence of fraud.
[02:53:08.741 --> 02:53:09.602]  And guess what there is?
[02:53:09.863 --> 02:53:11.746]  She stole the nomination!
[02:53:11.987 --> 02:53:14.191]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[02:53:14.251 --> 02:53:14.732]  What does that mean?
[02:53:15.737 --> 02:53:17.578]  How would the party pick a new nominee?
[02:53:17.799 --> 02:53:18.699]  Today is the day!
[02:53:18.779 --> 02:53:22.322]  They're really thinking about maybe getting him off the top of the ticket.
[02:53:22.542 --> 02:53:25.244]  He now looks increasingly like the Kamikaze candidate.
[02:53:25.825 --> 02:53:28.747]  An implosion the likes of which I have never seen.
[02:53:28.767 --> 02:53:31.889]  The biggest problem we have is we have a very dishonest media.
[02:53:32.550 --> 02:53:43.258]  If Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country.
[02:53:45.020 --> 02:53:47.342]  Including in places like Texas.
[02:53:49.604 --> 02:53:50.244]  That's ridiculous.
[02:53:50.324 --> 02:53:51.325]  That doesn't make any sense.
[02:53:51.405 --> 02:53:53.287]  And I don't think anybody would take that seriously.
[02:53:53.967 --> 02:53:57.330]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars is now controlling the narrative.
[02:53:57.810 --> 02:54:03.335]  Go to InfoWars.com for more information and InfoWarsStore.com to support the fight for truth.
[02:54:12.667 --> 02:54:18.883]  The preacher man says it's the end of time In the Mississippi River she's a-goin' dry
[02:54:25.257 --> 02:54:27.338]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:27.498 --> 02:54:30.761]  I am Leigh Ann McAdoo, joined in studio by Joe Biggs.
[02:54:31.201 --> 02:54:31.821]  Rocking out.
[02:54:31.841 --> 02:54:32.382]  I'm jamming out.
[02:54:32.402 --> 02:54:33.082]  This is my tune.
[02:54:33.102 --> 02:54:36.044]  I was actually listening to this on repeat last night for quite a bit.
[02:54:36.524 --> 02:54:37.505]  Quite a bit.
[02:54:38.326 --> 02:54:42.849]  Well, we are speaking now with InfoWars investigative journalist Wayne Madsen.
[02:54:42.869 --> 02:54:48.112]  We've been talking about the coordination between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department.
[02:54:48.512 --> 02:54:52.695]  Go to InfoWars.com and take a look at this chart as we're talking about it.
[02:54:54.397 --> 02:54:57.981]  Clinton Foundation donations linked to State Department favors.
[02:54:58.041 --> 02:54:59.744]  That's the article at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:00.104 --> 02:55:02.828]  Now, Wayne, what do you think is the key takeaway here?
[02:55:03.348 --> 02:55:09.657]  You obviously had to sort through a lot of emails and build this chart, but what do you really think people should focus on?
[02:55:11.038 --> 02:55:19.845]  Well, the fact is that it's like everything the Clintons are involved with, it's for their own personal enrichment.
[02:55:19.865 --> 02:55:35.077]  You remember, there were even reports when they left the White House in January 2001 that a lot of White House decorations and the facts went with them.
[02:55:35.617 --> 02:55:36.418]  I wonder if she gets
[02:55:36.838 --> 02:55:45.787]  Elected in November whether they'll be returning some of those to the White House, but but yeah, this is just a it's a constant theme with the Clintons.
[02:55:46.287 --> 02:55:54.035]  It's it's what's good for them and and you know and everyone else can really just go to blazes as far as they're concerned.
[02:55:54.355 --> 02:56:02.365]  The other thing they do is when they get in trouble, you notice they always surround themselves with all these aides and advisors.
[02:56:02.705 --> 02:56:05.869]  And when they get caught, they blame the aides and advisors.
[02:56:05.929 --> 02:56:12.417]  So look, Huma Abedin might think she's on solid ground with Hillary Clinton today, but that may not be the case.
[02:56:13.419 --> 02:56:18.305]  Uh, you know, in a couple of months, if there's any kind of investigation of what went on.
[02:56:18.625 --> 02:56:20.447]  Same thing with Doug Banditennio.
[02:56:20.688 --> 02:56:23.831]  The Clintons will throw their own friends under the bus.
[02:56:23.932 --> 02:56:25.514]  I mean, James McDougal.
[02:56:26.315 --> 02:56:28.477]  Today, today, under the bus.
[02:56:29.258 --> 02:56:31.259]  Today on USA Today, they posted an article.
[02:56:31.359 --> 02:56:35.702]  Clinton told FBI that Colin Powell advised her to use her personal email.
[02:56:35.942 --> 02:56:40.224]  So there you go again, deflecting and trying to duck and dodge and put the blame on someone else.
[02:56:40.684 --> 02:56:42.025]  Look, you're the head of state.
[02:56:42.505 --> 02:56:45.607]  You're an adult human being in a professional job.
[02:56:45.987 --> 02:56:46.988]  You know what the hell you're doing.
[02:56:47.008 --> 02:56:47.988]  You know right from wrong.
[02:56:48.229 --> 02:56:49.449]  Stop trying to put it on someone else.
[02:56:49.569 --> 02:56:51.390]  Leave Colin Powell alone.
[02:56:51.450 --> 02:56:54.992]  She's just like, oh, I'm a sweet little old grandma now and I just don't know.
[02:56:55.052 --> 02:56:55.873]  It's amazing.
[02:56:55.973 --> 02:56:57.874]  We can have an entire private server.
[02:56:58.174 --> 02:57:07.744]  We could have an entire room just full of articles of every criminal thing she's ever done, her and her husband, and no one wants to talk about it.
[02:57:07.964 --> 02:57:13.810]  They want to talk about a swimmer or a dead gorilla or, you know, some new rap video or something like that.
[02:57:13.910 --> 02:57:14.771]  It's ridiculous.
[02:57:15.151 --> 02:57:16.052]  Meanwhile, guess what?
[02:57:16.693 --> 02:57:23.819]  The president's playing golf, and Donald Trump is personally helping people down in Louisiana that are victims of all these floods going on.
[02:57:24.179 --> 02:57:29.023]  He actually told people today that didn't have flood insurance that he would donate to them to help them out.
[02:57:29.483 --> 02:57:30.344]  That's presidential.
[02:57:31.104 --> 02:57:32.185]  Right.
[02:57:32.225 --> 02:57:39.571]  They told the current president, don't even- Clinton would go down there and say, donate to our foundation, we'll help you guys out, and then they're going to go out and buy some new stuff.
[02:57:40.734 --> 02:57:45.357]  He also won up George W. Bush, who we remember after Katrina.
[02:57:45.758 --> 02:57:52.303]  The closest look he got of Louisiana was from Air Force One at around 30,000 feet.
[02:57:52.323 --> 02:57:53.123]  Well, that's the thing, though.
[02:57:53.163 --> 02:57:57.427]  People attacked Bush for that, but no one's really attacking Obama.
[02:57:57.787 --> 02:57:59.068]  The fact that he's out playing golf.
[02:58:00.709 --> 02:58:02.611]  No one's even touching that.
[02:58:02.651 --> 02:58:03.151]  I don't get it.
[02:58:03.672 --> 02:58:14.241]  Well, he's actually been having to... I mean, I know it takes away from the whole thing, but still though, the fact that... I know it makes it more difficult for first responders and all that trying to do their job down there.
[02:58:14.401 --> 02:58:15.982]  But still though, like, you know what?
[02:58:16.203 --> 02:58:17.264]  Put the golf clubs away.
[02:58:17.664 --> 02:58:18.725]  You played enough golf, man.
[02:58:19.085 --> 02:58:20.166]  He says it all the time.
[02:58:20.226 --> 02:58:22.647]  It's like, oh there's another beheading, oh there's a flood.
[02:58:22.707 --> 02:58:24.708]  Well, I'm sorry, I gotta go play golf.
[02:58:24.788 --> 02:58:26.028]  That's his go-to.
[02:58:26.449 --> 02:58:32.151]  But luckily we only have a few more months with President Obama in office.
[02:58:32.532 --> 02:58:35.533]  So Wayne Madsen, I definitely want you to stick around after the break.
[02:58:35.553 --> 02:58:39.635]  We're going to be entering the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:58:39.715 --> 02:58:40.816]  Joe Biggs is going to stick around.
[02:58:40.876 --> 02:58:42.997]  Maybe we'll take some of your phone calls as well.
[02:58:43.497 --> 02:58:45.738]  But I really want to get to this
[02:58:46.138 --> 02:58:49.304]  George Soros' story, being behind the Muslim takeover of the West.
[02:58:50.566 --> 02:58:52.389]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:54.092 --> 02:58:56.275]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:59.952 --> 02:59:00.292]  It's not.
[02:59:00.712 --> 02:59:09.735]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:59:09.815 --> 02:59:18.057]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:18.218 --> 02:59:22.919]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:59:23.099 --> 02:59:29.481]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:29.881 --> 02:59:36.966]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:59:37.046 --> 02:59:43.931]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:59:44.091 --> 02:59:48.435]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:59:48.575 --> 02:59:51.777]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:59:51.957 --> 02:59:53.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:24.617 --> 03:00:26.700]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:27.220 --> 03:00:32.227]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:44.674 --> 03:00:46.395]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:46.435 --> 03:00:48.857]  You have now entered Overdrive.
[03:00:49.057 --> 03:00:53.400]  Myself, Leanne McAdoo, and Joe Biggs will be here with you for the remainder of this hour.
[03:00:53.460 --> 03:00:58.663]  We're going to be opening up the phone lines to take your calls here at the bottom half.
[03:00:59.004 --> 03:01:03.186]  Now, we have been speaking with InfoWars investigative journalist Wayne Madsen.
[03:01:03.587 --> 03:01:10.251]  Right before the break, we were really kind of getting into the coordination between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department.
[03:01:10.651 --> 03:01:14.334]  But now I want to shift gears and talk about George Soros.
[03:01:14.774 --> 03:01:25.983]  Now he has got his little meddling hands in everything and now, thanks to some new leaks, some hacktivists, we see that he's behind the Muslim takeover of the West.
[03:01:26.383 --> 03:01:28.185]  So Wayne Madsen, give us the details.
[03:01:28.845 --> 03:01:38.432]  Well, very interesting internal Soros Foundation report was leaked, I guess as a result of a hacking incident.
[03:01:38.933 --> 03:01:43.877]  And you know, it really doesn't matter to me whether it's Russian hackers or it's WikiLeaks or it's
[03:01:44.457 --> 03:01:51.539]  You know, Guccifer 2.0, 3.0, whatever that is all about, as long as we get these documents.
[03:01:52.019 --> 03:01:58.141]  This is the transparency, by the way, that Mr. Obama promised us when he became president.
[03:01:58.181 --> 03:01:59.462]  Of course, we never saw it.
[03:01:59.642 --> 03:02:07.944]  As a matter of fact, we saw more whistleblowers go to prison under Obama than any of his predecessors since Woodrow Wilson combined.
[03:02:09.004 --> 03:02:13.926]  And so we've got this internal report, and I really think that this
[03:02:14.726 --> 03:02:25.275]  What surprised me is that Soros' people, and he of course, who funds these operations, were talking about taking advantage of migration corridors.
[03:02:25.836 --> 03:02:35.864]  And two initially were cited, from Central America and Mexico into the United States, and from the Middle East and North Africa into Europe.
[03:02:36.264 --> 03:02:48.308]  This is the first time we've seen a linkage between the migration into the United States by mostly Hispanics and the migration into Europe from the Middle East by mostly Muslims.
[03:02:48.808 --> 03:02:59.171]  You know, if Donald Trump plays his cards on this one right, he can link the issue of the wall to what he also has said is that Hillary Clinton will become another Angela Merkel.
[03:02:59.191 --> 03:03:03.333]  She, of course, allowed all these people, over a million, to come into Europe.
[03:03:04.255 --> 03:03:10.102]  If he can, if he can link, well, we know that Soros' document, it does link the two.
[03:03:10.582 --> 03:03:18.832]  And he also then talks in the document about creating new corridors, including one that's managed by one of the co-authors of the report.
[03:03:19.412 --> 03:03:24.233]  And that is from Eurasia into Russia and Europe.
[03:03:24.313 --> 03:03:25.813]  So this is what he's doing.
[03:03:25.853 --> 03:03:40.976]  He's advocating illegal massive migration on a global scale to basically change the ethnic makeup of various countries as we see what's happening in Europe and what's happening in the United States.
[03:03:41.556 --> 03:03:46.277]  And I think this is an amazing revelation from this document.
[03:03:46.677 --> 03:03:47.817]  As I say, it links
[03:03:48.958 --> 03:03:55.283]  In the past, people said we can't link Hispanic migration into the United States to what's going on in Europe.
[03:03:55.303 --> 03:03:58.085]  Yes, you can if you read this Soros document.
[03:03:58.485 --> 03:04:03.409]  It's clear-cut that the two illegal migrations are linked.
[03:04:03.549 --> 03:04:07.933]  And there's other migrations that have been started and others that are planned.
[03:04:09.554 --> 03:04:29.949]  Well, wow, and it's funny because I see a lot of people, they must be sock puppets, they must be trolls, but they come out and say, George Soros is a good guy, and he's just trying to give the little people the money and the funds that they need to help take down the globalists, the elitists that want to rule their countries.
[03:04:30.489 --> 03:04:32.931]  That's why he's destabilizing these nations.
[03:04:33.351 --> 03:04:44.924]  Well, I'll tell you, yeah, there's a lot of people in think tanks and policy laundry operations in Washington, London and around the world whose salaries are dependent on Mr. Soros.
[03:04:45.885 --> 03:04:48.929]  So you take the king's gold, you do the king's bidding.
[03:04:49.744 --> 03:04:50.645]  Right, no, exactly.
[03:04:50.665 --> 03:04:59.736]  And that's exactly why we've seen a lot of activists going to the Trump rallies, going after him, rather than going after their actual opponent at the time, Hillary Clinton.
[03:05:00.057 --> 03:05:03.000]  And that's why we see what happened there with Bernie Sanders.
[03:05:03.021 --> 03:05:07.206]  Stick around, we'll be right back after the break, speaking with more on George Soros.
[03:05:10.686 --> 03:05:16.172]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[03:05:16.693 --> 03:05:17.193]  Unveiled!
[03:05:17.594 --> 03:05:20.657]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula.
[03:05:21.338 --> 03:05:24.601]  30 servings, fruit, punch, flavor, dietary supplement.
[03:05:24.901 --> 03:05:25.963]  It is simply amazing.
[03:05:26.023 --> 03:05:26.964]  Infowarslife.com
[03:05:27.364 --> 03:05:31.769]  There's a million different products like this out there that they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[03:05:32.289 --> 03:05:45.384]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all the essential amino acids, all the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[03:05:45.744 --> 03:05:46.965]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[03:05:47.005 --> 03:05:48.187]  I put it in my protein shake.
[03:05:48.807 --> 03:05:54.288]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[03:05:54.308 --> 03:05:57.329]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[03:05:57.369 --> 03:05:59.609]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[03:06:00.209 --> 03:06:06.351]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[03:06:06.571 --> 03:06:08.931]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[03:06:09.291 --> 03:06:11.152]  Okay, this... Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[03:06:11.172 --> 03:06:13.492]  Yeah, this... I wanna... But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[03:06:13.692 --> 03:06:14.553]  Yeah.
[03:06:14.794 --> 03:06:18.498]  And there's other powders I promote at Infowarshealth.com that are excellent.
[03:06:18.839 --> 03:06:20.080]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[03:06:20.240 --> 03:06:22.924]  This is just the very best we can bring you.
[03:06:22.944 --> 03:06:24.986]  And when you buy it, you support Infowars.
[03:06:25.247 --> 03:06:26.288]  You support the reporters.
[03:06:26.528 --> 03:06:27.269]  You support yourself.
[03:06:28.496 --> 03:06:48.082]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this and why this is just this total complete package for your body because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[03:06:48.582 --> 03:06:49.202]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:06:49.242 --> 03:06:52.383]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[03:06:52.483 --> 03:06:53.723]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[03:06:53.743 --> 03:06:54.343]  Tell folks about that.
[03:06:54.483 --> 03:06:57.224]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[03:06:57.244 --> 03:07:00.745]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[03:07:01.325 --> 03:07:07.667]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine, each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[03:07:08.107 --> 03:07:11.307]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[03:07:11.567 --> 03:07:12.848]  34 other ones you can check out.
[03:07:13.048 --> 03:07:14.888]  Go to infowarslife.com, the label's up there.
[03:07:15.408 --> 03:07:17.709]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[03:07:18.109 --> 03:07:25.511]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just... By the way, look on the other side too, because we're showing people the minerals and things.
[03:07:25.551 --> 03:07:27.412]  Let's look at the vitamins right there, Old Scott, in there.
[03:07:27.432 --> 03:07:28.092]  I mean, it's amazing.
[03:07:28.132 --> 03:07:28.392]  Top left.
[03:07:28.472 --> 03:07:32.013]  Again, if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:07:32.374 --> 03:07:35.434]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and... What's the other source?
[03:07:36.115 --> 03:07:38.856]  I just show this to all the best sources.
[03:07:40.566 --> 03:07:40.986]  Retinol.
[03:07:41.006 --> 03:07:45.489]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[03:07:45.809 --> 03:07:46.209]  And you know what?
[03:07:46.289 --> 03:07:48.450]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[03:07:48.690 --> 03:07:49.270]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[03:07:49.310 --> 03:07:56.314]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[03:07:56.634 --> 03:08:02.177]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[03:08:02.677 --> 03:08:03.518]  So get them today.
[03:08:03.598 --> 03:08:05.639]  Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[03:08:23.760 --> 03:08:28.707]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:33.075 --> 03:08:35.357]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:35.477 --> 03:08:40.681]  I am your host Leanne McAdoo here with Joe Biggs and you out there, you are the resistance.
[03:08:40.721 --> 03:08:43.964]  Thank you so much for joining us here into this fourth hour.
[03:08:44.044 --> 03:08:52.430]  Now we have been speaking with our investigative journalist Wayne Madsen talking about George Soros, how he's got his meddling hands and everything.
[03:08:52.751 --> 03:08:54.952]  And key takeaway from this report is
[03:08:56.033 --> 03:09:01.576]  Is how he's giving these global grants to open up the floodgates for this illegal mass migration.
[03:09:01.636 --> 03:09:04.157]  We're seeing how that's destroying Europe.
[03:09:04.658 --> 03:09:18.185]  And a lot of people, whether they want to admit it or not, are actually in support of Donald Trump's plans to a build the wall, but also curb this open migration from
[03:09:18.885 --> 03:09:26.475]  People from these countries with terrorist ties, that we have to make sure that they are ideologically lined up with American values.
[03:09:26.875 --> 03:09:29.158]  So Wayne, get into these global grants.
[03:09:30.509 --> 03:09:34.613]  Well, when you read this leaked Soros report, it's interesting.
[03:09:36.234 --> 03:09:49.987]  I put basically put all these organizations, these NGOs are all involved in basically trying to change national immigration law to either weaken it or get rid of it or
[03:09:50.527 --> 03:09:54.369]  Telling people how to evade it, how to evade border controls.
[03:09:54.809 --> 03:10:00.512]  Now, one of the key individuals that the Soros people is working with is a guy named Peter Sutherland.
[03:10:00.932 --> 03:10:06.514]  That may not be a household name to a lot of people, but he is the former director of GATT.
[03:10:06.614 --> 03:10:09.596]  That was the forerunner to the World Trade Organization.
[03:10:10.036 --> 03:10:12.137]  He's now the UN Special Envoy for
[03:10:12.637 --> 03:10:14.659]  For refugees and migration.
[03:10:15.119 --> 03:10:20.924]  He's also a former chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
[03:10:21.604 --> 03:10:26.548]  Okay, so, you know, who was Hillary giving all those speeches for, making all that money?
[03:10:26.608 --> 03:10:27.429]  Goldman Sachs.
[03:10:28.129 --> 03:10:29.871]  Heidi Cruz, who did she work for?
[03:10:30.151 --> 03:10:30.932]  Goldman Sachs.
[03:10:31.212 --> 03:10:37.377]  She got booed, basically, by people who were also yelling Goldman Sachs at the convention in Cleveland.
[03:10:37.677 --> 03:10:39.939]  People are starting to wake up to this.
[03:10:40.019 --> 03:10:45.103]  But when you see this report, you see, you know, who are these players that are involved?
[03:10:45.143 --> 03:10:53.110]  And basically, they're undermining national sovereignty by basically saying, look, you can get around border controls.
[03:10:53.450 --> 03:10:57.513]  We can weaken these immigration laws to allow this mass migration.
[03:10:57.853 --> 03:10:58.713]  What's the end goal?
[03:10:58.733 --> 03:11:12.262]  Well, we know what Merkel's goal in Germany is to get more cheap labor, but what she's going to sacrifice for that is the German nation as we've known it, basically a Christian
[03:11:12.802 --> 03:11:13.402]  I don't know.
[03:11:33.311 --> 03:11:35.072]  They're not going to be changing their religion.
[03:11:35.092 --> 03:11:40.777]  They're looking at Germany to change its ways to become more like a Sharia law state.
[03:11:41.938 --> 03:11:46.962]  And that's going to cause major problems in Germany and other European countries.
[03:11:48.403 --> 03:11:50.885]  And the only thing I can see stopping this
[03:11:53.305 --> 03:11:58.046]  If you see where Soros puts his money, he hates populist parties.
[03:11:58.466 --> 03:12:01.927]  He hates the UK Independence Party and the Brexit.
[03:12:02.287 --> 03:12:05.707]  He hates people like Boris Johnson, the new Foreign Secretary of Britain.
[03:12:05.747 --> 03:12:07.088]  He hates Le Pen in France.
[03:12:07.488 --> 03:12:13.389]  He hates the alternative for Deutschland, the anti-immigration party in Germany.
[03:12:13.449 --> 03:12:19.810]  If we see these parties come to political power, that may start to spell the end of Mr. Soros.
[03:12:20.774 --> 03:12:27.156]  Absolutely, and of course, continued hard-hitting journalism from journalists such as yourself, Wayne Madsen.
[03:12:27.436 --> 03:12:30.938]  The establishment's afraid of Donald Trump, but I think they're afraid of you as well.
[03:12:31.638 --> 03:12:33.478]  Thank you so much for joining us with the show today.
[03:12:33.518 --> 03:12:36.119]  That's Wayne Madsen at WayneMadsenReport.com.
[03:12:36.800 --> 03:12:40.301]  You can check out all of his hard-hitting articles at InfoWars.com.
[03:12:40.801 --> 03:12:45.342]  And, you know, he just does some amazing, incredible work, which we're able to do that.
[03:12:45.382 --> 03:12:46.323]  We're able to bring on
[03:12:47.063 --> 03:12:55.989]  People like Wayne Madsen who do such incredible work because of the support of our users and listeners out there, people who are buying our products.
[03:12:56.169 --> 03:12:59.751]  So I wanted to go ahead and say thank you to Wayne Madsen.
[03:13:00.131 --> 03:13:05.734]  And then let's go to the InfoWarsLife.com so you guys can check out Living Defense.
[03:13:06.115 --> 03:13:08.456]  This is what we're having our big sale on right now, 20% off.
[03:13:10.213 --> 03:13:10.934]  We're good to go.
[03:13:25.307 --> 03:13:26.848]  Stars there.
[03:13:27.409 --> 03:13:30.331]  A lot of people are saying this is an excellent product.
[03:13:30.411 --> 03:13:34.174]  Let's hear from Pellegrino de Marie in Massachusetts.
[03:13:34.594 --> 03:13:39.898]  She says, I have been using this living defense for 20 days and feel rejuvenated.
[03:13:39.918 --> 03:13:51.107]  And this is one of those products that you do have to use it for a few weeks, if not a couple of months to really get out the organisms because they have babies.
[03:13:52.768 --> 03:13:59.132]  So you got to get the main organisms and their babies, which is kind of disgusting and that's why this is such a great product.
[03:13:59.973 --> 03:14:03.835]  Just Cindy from Virginia says, this is a great product.
[03:14:03.875 --> 03:14:05.016]  She gives it five stars.
[03:14:05.376 --> 03:14:07.638]  She says, I've been on it approximately three weeks.
[03:14:07.718 --> 03:14:09.439]  I feel so much better in general.
[03:14:09.579 --> 03:14:14.142]  I only do three capsules a day, two in the morning before my coffee and one before lunch.
[03:14:14.542 --> 03:14:15.663]  I've had no complaints.
[03:14:15.843 --> 03:14:17.265]  It makes me sleep better at night.
[03:14:17.405 --> 03:14:19.106]  I do drink purified water with it.
[03:14:19.467 --> 03:14:22.430]  I don't drink any sodas, just purified water all day.
[03:14:22.450 --> 03:14:23.691]  And that's Cindy.
[03:14:23.771 --> 03:14:25.873]  She is giving us a five-star review.
[03:14:25.893 --> 03:14:32.219]  I know my friend Emmy Robin has also been taking the product because she was feeling a bit icky.
[03:14:32.599 --> 03:14:35.722]  And I know it's been a total 180 for her as well, completely.
[03:14:36.803 --> 03:14:38.324]  Cleaned her skin.
[03:14:38.384 --> 03:14:42.046]  She has now really clear, healthy skin from this product.
[03:14:42.487 --> 03:14:54.154]  Just eliminating those toxins and all those harmful organisms, you'd be really surprised at just how quickly your body can turn around when you get the harmful organisms and toxins out of your system.
[03:14:54.194 --> 03:14:55.935]  So that's Living Defense.
[03:14:56.115 --> 03:14:59.117]  It's on sale for a limited time because we're gonna sell out.
[03:14:59.577 --> 03:15:01.138]  That's at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:15:01.658 --> 03:15:02.298]  20% off.
[03:15:02.318 --> 03:15:03.839]  Get it today while supplies last.
[03:15:05.220 --> 03:15:11.082]  And now we're going to go to, we're going to go ahead and play one more highlight from Donald Trump's speech.
[03:15:11.683 --> 03:15:14.684]  And here he's kind of highlighting the Democratic failures.
[03:15:15.424 --> 03:15:20.106]  This could take hours, but he did it here in just a very short speech.
[03:15:20.506 --> 03:15:26.208]  And he goes on to talk about how this immigration is terrible, and it's going to be terrible for the lives of minorities.
[03:15:29.009 --> 03:15:30.550]  Look how badly.
[03:15:31.658 --> 03:15:35.863]  Things are going under decades of democratic leadership.
[03:15:36.644 --> 03:15:43.111]  Look at the schools, look at the poverty, look at the 58% of young African Americans not working, 58%.
[03:15:43.151 --> 03:15:44.012]  It is time for a change.
[03:15:53.149 --> 03:15:58.276]  What do you have to lose by trying something new?
[03:15:58.296 --> 03:15:59.358]  I will fix it.
[03:15:59.718 --> 03:16:00.099]  Watch.
[03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:01.521]  I will fix it.
[03:16:03.704 --> 03:16:04.926]  You have nothing to lose.
[03:16:05.827 --> 03:16:06.688]  Nothing to lose.
[03:16:06.708 --> 03:16:08.611]  It is so bad.
[03:16:09.474 --> 03:16:12.597]  The inner cities are so bad, you have nothing to lose.
[03:16:13.418 --> 03:16:18.303]  They have been playing with you for 60, 70, 80 years.
[03:16:18.524 --> 03:16:19.665]  Many, many decades.
[03:16:20.125 --> 03:16:21.407]  You have nothing to lose.
[03:16:21.547 --> 03:16:23.108]  I will do a great job.
[03:16:29.795 --> 03:16:32.018]  This means so much to me.
[03:16:32.964 --> 03:16:42.910]  And I will work as hard as I can to bring new opportunity to places in our country which have not known it in a very, very long time.
[03:16:43.891 --> 03:16:52.316]  Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party have taken African American votes totally for granted.
[03:16:53.897 --> 03:16:58.200]  Because the votes have been automatically there for them.
[03:16:59.107 --> 03:17:04.390]  There has been no reason for Democrats to produce, and they haven't.
[03:17:04.990 --> 03:17:07.892]  They haven't produced in decades and decades.
[03:17:08.893 --> 03:17:23.201]  It's time to break with the failures of the past and to fight for every last American child in this country to have a better and a much, much brighter future.
[03:17:28.183 --> 03:17:38.225]  In my administration, every American will be treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally.
[03:17:39.865 --> 03:17:54.288]  We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people.
[03:17:58.874 --> 03:18:03.635]  This is the change I am promising to all of you.
[03:18:04.555 --> 03:18:13.398]  An honest government, a great economy, and a just society for each and every American.
[03:18:19.899 --> 03:18:21.880]  But we can never, ever
[03:18:22.995 --> 03:18:31.822]  Fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place.
[03:18:32.522 --> 03:18:36.586]  Can't do it.
[03:18:36.606 --> 03:18:41.810]  72% of voters say our country is on the wrong track.
[03:18:44.692 --> 03:18:49.996]  I am the change candidate, Hillary Clinton.
[03:18:51.801 --> 03:19:02.050]  Is for the failed status quo to protect her special interests, her donors, her lobbyists, and others.
[03:19:02.971 --> 03:19:08.876]  It is time to vote for a new American future.
[03:19:11.779 --> 03:19:15.562]  Together, we will make America strong again.
[03:19:16.346 --> 03:19:18.828]  We will make America proud again.
[03:19:19.428 --> 03:19:22.310]  We will make America safe again.
[03:19:23.891 --> 03:19:36.378]  Friends and fellow citizens, come November, we will make America great again, greater than ever before.
[03:19:37.018 --> 03:19:37.639]  Thank you.
[03:19:38.359 --> 03:19:38.919]  Thank you.
[03:19:39.360 --> 03:19:40.360]  And God bless you.
[03:19:40.660 --> 03:19:41.061]  Thank you.
[03:19:53.163 --> 03:19:55.011]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:55.091 --> 03:19:55.654]  Stay with us.
[03:20:10.298 --> 03:20:11.700]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[03:20:11.740 --> 03:20:12.821]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:20:13.081 --> 03:20:14.002]  Why is this so good?
[03:20:14.282 --> 03:20:19.526]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:20:19.606 --> 03:20:33.157]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:20:33.217 --> 03:20:34.599]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:20:35.359 --> 03:20:36.961]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[03:20:37.021 --> 03:20:39.503]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:20:39.603 --> 03:20:40.864]  These are all parasites.
[03:20:40.924 --> 03:20:42.005]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:20:42.025 --> 03:20:43.066]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:20:43.366 --> 03:20:49.972]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood, you have enzyme blend in there.
[03:20:50.012 --> 03:20:55.217]  This is very important because a lot of these microorganisms and even going up to tapeworms, pinworms,
[03:20:55.757 --> 03:20:57.939]  You have to disintegrate the lining.
[03:20:57.959 --> 03:21:02.983]  I mean, on viruses that protect themselves, and so do bacteria and protozoa and mycoplasms.
[03:21:03.363 --> 03:21:07.586]  They have a protective shell that a lot of times the immune system can't even get into.
[03:21:07.787 --> 03:21:08.847]  Our own immune system.
[03:21:09.408 --> 03:21:12.090]  Especially since most people's immune system are weak anyway.
[03:21:12.250 --> 03:21:14.811]  People can avoid toxic air if they want.
[03:21:14.831 --> 03:21:16.472]  They can get an air purification system.
[03:21:16.492 --> 03:21:22.654]  They can avoid toxic water and drink clean water, but it's really hard to avoid parasites.
[03:21:23.154 --> 03:21:27.416]  It's hard to avoid attacking organisms and that's where I see this going.
[03:21:27.456 --> 03:21:29.457]  I mean, I think a lot of the information that we
[03:21:30.077 --> 03:21:30.537]  We're good to go.
[03:21:51.627 --> 03:21:53.268]  So the Living Defense is amazing.
[03:21:53.488 --> 03:21:55.748]  We've seen just tremendous reviews.
[03:21:56.429 --> 03:21:58.569]  How often could you take Living Defense?
[03:21:58.589 --> 03:21:59.970]  I mean, is it a regimen every day?
[03:22:00.010 --> 03:22:01.831]  That's what I was doing until we ran out.
[03:22:02.191 --> 03:22:03.891]  Or do you do it heavier for certain cleanses?
[03:22:03.911 --> 03:22:04.752]  What do you do, Dr. Group?
[03:22:05.432 --> 03:22:16.996]  Well, I do usually six weeks at a time, because if you look at the life cycle of most parasites, it's six weeks from the time... So you've got to kill the ones that are in there and then kill their babies when the eggs hatch up?
[03:22:17.316 --> 03:22:31.910]  If you're suffering from abdominal pain, allergies, even like headaches, anemia, weakened immune system, gut problems, depression, hair loss, excess gas, muscle pain, nervousness, I mean all these things.
[03:22:31.970 --> 03:22:39.037]  If you look at some of these conditions and then us opening up our borders and all the other countries opening up their borders,
[03:22:39.597 --> 03:22:50.023]  You're just dealing with a mass amount of parasites or harmful organisms or biological weapons that are spreading and mutating all across the world.
[03:22:50.043 --> 03:22:51.704]  And I think that's one of the reasons why.
[03:22:51.724 --> 03:22:54.206]  I mean, all you have to do is look at the news these days.
[03:22:54.766 --> 03:22:57.207]  You can type in refugees spreading disease.
[03:22:57.247 --> 03:22:59.509]  I mean, the CDC is going crazy right now.
[03:23:00.149 --> 03:23:04.570]  There's a new antibiotic-resistant E. coli that they just identified.
[03:23:04.690 --> 03:23:05.791]  Doctors don't know.
[03:23:05.871 --> 03:23:09.512]  They don't teach doctors in medical school about parasites and harmful organisms.
[03:23:09.532 --> 03:23:11.652]  There's a reason why they don't teach them about that.
[03:23:11.752 --> 03:23:17.714]  Just like they don't teach doctors about the root cause of disease and how to eliminate all disease out there.
[03:23:17.774 --> 03:23:19.174]  They don't want you to know about it.
[03:23:19.435 --> 03:23:22.115]  You don't want your own immune system being attacked.
[03:23:22.395 --> 03:23:25.776]  Again, you know, you have animals, especially your cats, dogs.
[03:23:25.816 --> 03:23:27.637]  So many people have pets these days.
[03:23:28.137 --> 03:23:29.538]  People eat raw sushi.
[03:23:29.958 --> 03:23:31.580]  People eat more raw food.
[03:23:31.620 --> 03:23:35.843]  You have all these different organisms showing up in the water supplies now.
[03:23:36.343 --> 03:23:39.666]  You even have it in the air supplies, these tiny microorganisms.
[03:23:39.706 --> 03:23:42.528]  So it's not like we can get away from them.
[03:23:42.588 --> 03:23:44.069]  We just have to do everything.
[03:23:44.149 --> 03:23:45.631]  I recommend doing a parasite
[03:23:46.551 --> 03:23:51.013]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in, because I'm going back on it today.
[03:23:51.033 --> 03:23:52.033]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:23:52.093 --> 03:23:52.633]  Living Defense.
[03:23:52.933 --> 03:23:53.974]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:23:54.054 --> 03:23:55.054]  And folks, you can't lose.
[03:23:55.074 --> 03:23:57.155]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:23:57.795 --> 03:23:59.656]  And you support the broadcast.
[03:23:59.716 --> 03:24:00.796]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:24:01.076 --> 03:24:02.957]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[03:24:03.337 --> 03:24:05.298]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:24:25.284 --> 03:24:29.747]  I will spare you the singing us in from the break as a la Alex Jones.
[03:24:29.827 --> 03:24:32.228]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:32.248 --> 03:24:36.291]  I am here Leanne McAdoo with the great patriot Joe Biggs.
[03:24:36.891 --> 03:24:42.955]  Now Joe, when I watched the film Amerigeddon, there's a lot of things in this movie that kind of help you
[03:24:44.261 --> 03:24:47.023]  Put yourself in the scenario of what's going to happen when the grid goes down.
[03:24:47.043 --> 03:24:48.804]  What are you going to do when you want to prepare?
[03:24:48.824 --> 03:24:57.250]  It really made me realize that I don't want to have a hipster boyfriend there when the stuff hits the fan.
[03:24:57.690 --> 03:25:00.572]  I want the guy that knows what he's going to do.
[03:25:00.592 --> 03:25:01.813]  Yeah, I don't get it.
[03:25:01.833 --> 03:25:05.175]  There's like some smoking hot chicks in Austin and they got these hipster boyfriends.
[03:25:05.655 --> 03:25:06.556]  And I'm like, you know what?
[03:25:06.636 --> 03:25:07.397]  When things go down,
[03:25:08.482 --> 03:25:09.283]  What's this guy gonna do?
[03:25:09.343 --> 03:25:10.303]  He can't even load a gun.
[03:25:10.383 --> 03:25:12.625]  He don't even know what a firing pin is.
[03:25:12.825 --> 03:25:15.486]  Or he doesn't even know what a shock group is, you know?
[03:25:15.506 --> 03:25:17.808]  Like, get in your shooting stance.
[03:25:17.968 --> 03:25:25.092]  That's like, he can't even get in his shooting stance because his pants are so tight that it's cut off the circulation and he's just like throwing donuts.
[03:25:25.112 --> 03:25:26.213]  Like, he doesn't know what's going on.
[03:25:26.433 --> 03:25:27.354]  Like, that's what you want?
[03:25:27.834 --> 03:25:28.094]  Come on.
[03:25:28.254 --> 03:25:30.716]  You can't grow a pair with pants that tight.
[03:25:30.776 --> 03:25:32.337]  Yeah, that tight.
[03:25:32.357 --> 03:25:33.958]  What you need to do is grow your own food.
[03:25:33.978 --> 03:25:34.978]  Right.
[03:25:35.038 --> 03:25:36.940]  And get some solar panels and be ready to
[03:25:38.786 --> 03:25:40.448]  To do something if it does happen.
[03:25:40.468 --> 03:25:43.832]  The chances of an EMP attack are pretty good.
[03:25:44.193 --> 03:25:47.537]  The chances of just complete and total collapse is good.
[03:25:47.597 --> 03:25:49.299]  People need to get back to their roots.
[03:25:50.220 --> 03:25:54.766]  Learn to hunt, learn to clean, learn to do that field dressing, learn how to store that meat.
[03:25:56.377 --> 03:25:59.420]  Go buy the storage food that we already have, seeds, all this stuff.
[03:25:59.460 --> 03:26:06.186]  I mean, we've got tons of stuff at the InfoWars store that you can get, storable foods that'll last forever, that taste amazing.
[03:26:06.326 --> 03:26:15.195]  Think about all those people in Louisiana right now, people that were stranded on the highway for days, anyone living on the Gulf Coast, really, that could be a victim of a hurricane that could come.
[03:26:15.655 --> 03:26:26.522]  Those are people that really needed to have these supplies, be prepared for something like that, because when you have to cut off that transport, when the trucks can't get in to bring you food, how are you going to feed yourselves?
[03:26:26.783 --> 03:26:31.726]  And if your town is three feet underwater, well there goes your crops.
[03:26:31.806 --> 03:26:33.787]  I get stopped by TSA every flight.
[03:26:33.807 --> 03:26:37.250]  I'm about to fly again tonight to go to Kentucky to a shooting competition, but
[03:26:37.930 --> 03:26:47.877]  I always carry tools that I need in case the plane goes down and I somehow survive, you know, in the miraculous, you know, the if a miracle happens, I somehow survive a plane crash.
[03:26:47.897 --> 03:26:49.538]  I'm going to have flashlights and all this stuff.
[03:26:49.818 --> 03:26:52.900]  But regardless, I'm going to a new area where I don't have all my stuff.
[03:26:53.380 --> 03:26:56.182]  I have like a bug out bag that I take with me on every trip.
[03:26:56.262 --> 03:27:00.085]  It's got tools, some food, snacks, water, all this stuff.
[03:27:00.105 --> 03:27:03.387]  You've got to be prepared all the time, especially if you travel as much as I do.
[03:27:03.427 --> 03:27:07.670]  You can't just, you know, depend on having that stuff at your house only.
[03:27:08.571 --> 03:27:10.272]  But it's definitely something important to have.
[03:27:10.312 --> 03:27:12.454]  And Amerigeddon puts out a really good positive message.
[03:27:12.754 --> 03:27:21.941]  It makes you think outside of the box, you know, and it kind of takes you out of that complacency that you've kind of been in for some time and really get out there and think about, all right, what if this does happen?
[03:27:22.421 --> 03:27:28.086]  And then you can evaluate where you are now, your living situation, what you have, are you prepared at all?
[03:27:28.446 --> 03:27:32.789]  You know, I think a lot of families are going to leave from that movie and did leave from that movie going, man,
[03:27:33.610 --> 03:27:35.212]  If something happens, we aren't prepared.
[03:27:35.232 --> 03:27:36.894]  Let's go start getting prepared.
[03:27:36.914 --> 03:27:39.336]  Let's look into this and let's find out what we can do.
[03:27:53.231 --> 03:28:00.980]  So this social justice warrior girl, she has this kind of hipster boyfriend, he's super cool, and when the stuff goes down, he's nowhere to be found.
[03:28:01.360 --> 03:28:05.845]  And she realizes, like, well, you know, maybe I didn't need to get myself a feminist boyfriend.
[03:28:05.865 --> 03:28:12.432]  Well, she had to go back to her first boyfriend, which was an army soldier that actually knew how to get out there.
[03:28:12.452 --> 03:28:12.792]  We're good to go.
[03:28:38.221 --> 03:28:41.323]  It's a great tool to help wake up your family and your friends.
[03:28:41.843 --> 03:28:44.445]  And Alex Jones is running a special right now.
[03:28:44.485 --> 03:28:49.569]  When you buy two copies of Amerageddon, you can get four Alex Jones films for free.
[03:28:49.890 --> 03:28:52.171]  Police State 4, Police State Trilogy.
[03:28:52.251 --> 03:28:55.914]  Alex says, give these extras out as stocking stuffers.
[03:28:55.994 --> 03:28:57.035]  Take them to the library.
[03:28:57.115 --> 03:28:59.057]  Let people rent these films for free.
[03:28:59.517 --> 03:29:01.979]  Kind of break open their minds of what would they do?
[03:29:02.219 --> 03:29:03.020]  Are they prepared?
[03:29:03.420 --> 03:29:06.763]  And we really ask that you not only support this operation,
[03:29:07.503 --> 03:29:10.544]  But you also support independent films out there.
[03:29:10.604 --> 03:29:17.687]  People that are putting their money, their lives on the line to expose the globalists and help us take this fight to the next level.
[03:29:18.048 --> 03:29:20.248]  So that is the new Amerageddon film.
[03:29:20.288 --> 03:29:24.550]  You can get it exclusively at TheInfoWarStore.com right now.
[03:29:24.870 --> 03:29:27.412]  That's for the exclusive release of Amerageddon.
[03:29:28.132 --> 03:29:32.854]  And for all you ladies out there that are dating hipsters, remember, if the apocalypse happens, you're screwed.
[03:29:33.616 --> 03:29:34.697]  Oh, it's true.
[03:29:34.717 --> 03:29:36.979]  I mean, it really has put it in perspective for me.
[03:29:36.999 --> 03:29:38.560]  You're a tough guy.
[03:29:38.980 --> 03:29:43.064]  I don't like you when you're burping and stuff like that.
[03:29:43.084 --> 03:29:44.825]  Hey, I don't hold back.
[03:29:44.905 --> 03:29:46.026]  I am who I am all the time.
[03:29:47.207 --> 03:29:50.089]  Well, and we appreciate it, Joe Biggs, everyone out there.
[03:29:50.429 --> 03:29:57.135]  All right, well, when we get back, we're going to be talking about more of Hillary's lies and the mainstream media's denies.
[03:29:57.155 --> 03:29:58.796]  Stick around.
[03:29:59.349 --> 03:30:02.337]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.280 --> 03:30:05.967]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.797 --> 03:30:15.059]  State Department, $400 million to Iran was contingent on U.S.
[03:30:15.219 --> 03:30:16.419]  prisoners' release.
[03:30:16.639 --> 03:30:18.940]  The State Department admitted Thursday that the U.S.
[03:30:19.020 --> 03:30:24.582]  would not hand over $400 million in cash to Iran until it released four American hostages.
[03:30:24.742 --> 03:30:28.864]  Two weeks after, President Obama insisted the payment was not a ransom.
[03:30:28.984 --> 03:30:37.787]  State Department spokesman John Kirby was asked at Thursday's press briefing, in basic English, you're saying you wouldn't give them $400 million in cash
[03:30:37.887 --> 03:30:39.730]  Until the prisoners were released, correct?
[03:30:39.850 --> 03:30:41.192]  That's correct, Kirby replied.
[03:30:41.372 --> 03:30:45.217]  In an August 4th press conference, President Obama said the opposite.
[03:30:45.277 --> 03:30:46.459]  We do not pay ransom.
[03:30:46.599 --> 03:30:50.604]  We didn't hear and we won't in the future, the president told reporters.
[03:30:50.825 --> 03:30:54.570]  Speaking of the January 17th payment and hostage release,
[03:30:54.850 --> 03:30:58.012]  Families know we have a policy that we don't pay ransom.
[03:30:58.092 --> 03:31:04.997]  And the notion that we would somehow start now, in this high-profile way, defies logic Obama added at the time.
[03:31:05.077 --> 03:31:05.677]  Well, guess what?
[03:31:05.717 --> 03:31:06.878]  The cat's out of the bag.
[03:31:07.098 --> 03:31:07.758]  You lied.
[03:31:07.879 --> 03:31:10.140]  We called it InfoWars.com.
[03:31:10.560 --> 03:31:19.626]  If you can't see the irony in having a gun ban enforced by men with guns, well, then you fail to understand why the Second Amendment was written in the first place.
[03:31:19.686 --> 03:31:22.508]  Throughout history, only slaves are disarmed.
[03:31:22.628 --> 03:31:26.411]  A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
[03:31:26.532 --> 03:31:27.633]  The right of the people.
[03:31:27.733 --> 03:31:28.874]  The right of the people.
[03:31:28.934 --> 03:31:29.835]  The right of the people.
[03:31:29.935 --> 03:31:32.377]  To keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[03:31:32.417 --> 03:31:41.265]  For all of you actors out there who go to your red carpet events surrounded by full battle rattle swat teams while you accept your awards for your latest violent movie.
[03:31:41.305 --> 03:31:42.765]  I have a strict gun control policy.
[03:31:42.785 --> 03:31:44.906]  If there's a gun around, I want to control it.
[03:31:44.966 --> 03:31:45.846]  Clint Eastwood.
[03:31:45.866 --> 03:31:46.066]  Go ahead.
[03:31:46.126 --> 03:31:46.706]  Make my day.
[03:31:46.726 --> 03:31:49.826]  Dads demand guns because it's me that's got to get up and go check out that noise at 2am.
[03:31:49.847 --> 03:31:50.127]  Infowars.com
[03:32:10.503 --> 03:32:11.624]  The brain force is here.
[03:32:12.165 --> 03:32:14.448]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:32:14.708 --> 03:32:22.517]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of brain force.
[03:32:23.311 --> 03:32:26.493]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[03:32:26.734 --> 03:32:26.874]  Right?
[03:32:26.894 --> 03:32:29.236]  You're gonna crash and you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[03:32:29.616 --> 03:32:33.119]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[03:32:33.179 --> 03:32:36.301]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[03:32:36.801 --> 03:32:41.625]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[03:32:42.146 --> 03:32:43.987]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[03:32:44.327 --> 03:32:48.751]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[03:32:48.911 --> 03:32:50.932]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[03:32:51.553 --> 03:32:53.014]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[03:32:53.154 --> 03:32:53.394]  Exactly.
[03:32:53.434 --> 03:32:57.217]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[03:32:57.717 --> 03:33:05.723]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:33:30.768 --> 03:33:35.703]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:45.078 --> 03:33:46.999]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:47.039 --> 03:33:48.920]  We are winding down the hour here.
[03:33:49.000 --> 03:33:51.442]  I'm Leanne McAdoo here with Joe Biggs.
[03:33:52.962 --> 03:33:57.745]  Now, one of the things that we've been kind of preparing for this year is with UT.
[03:33:57.765 --> 03:34:04.368]  Of course, this will be the kind of inaugural campus carry coming into effect this semester.
[03:34:04.388 --> 03:34:06.750]  A lot of people have been raising concerns.
[03:34:06.810 --> 03:34:07.790]  What's going to happen?
[03:34:09.151 --> 03:34:11.132]  You know, what I think is going to happen is a lot of
[03:34:11.372 --> 03:34:18.100]  More females are going to feel safe on campus knowing that they can walk around at night and they are not going to be victims to some of the attacks.
[03:34:19.042 --> 03:34:22.125]  Like we saw, a girl was actually murdered on UT campus last year.
[03:34:22.145 --> 03:34:26.331]  So I think we're going to be seeing a lot of changes, but it's setting a precedent.
[03:34:26.671 --> 03:34:30.416]  So what's going on at other gun-free campuses across the nation?
[03:34:30.868 --> 03:34:36.951]  Well, this is an article, I think it's by Breitbart, it says students robbed at gunpoint on gun-free campus.
[03:34:36.971 --> 03:34:45.716]  It says, ironically, the robbery at gunpoint is the second high-profile criminal use of guns on the FSU campus in less than two years.
[03:34:46.616 --> 03:34:51.098]  A gunman opened fire outside FSU's Central Library on November 20, 2014.
[03:34:51.759 --> 03:35:00.143]  And then a concealed carry permit holder was close enough to take out the gunman in the incident, but was barred from carrying a gun because of a gun-free campus law.
[03:35:00.783 --> 03:35:01.263]  Come on!
[03:35:01.784 --> 03:35:03.345]  You know, and it's funny.
[03:35:03.385 --> 03:35:06.927]  Campus Carry has been in effect now for a little bit and there's been no shootings.
[03:35:07.407 --> 03:35:08.188]  Nothing's going on.
[03:35:08.568 --> 03:35:10.849]  It's just like when we had Open Carry come out here in Texas.
[03:35:10.889 --> 03:35:18.814]  It was like everyone thought there was just gonna be like all these like Western movies, like everyone's gun-toting, got like, you know, three or four guns on their side and you're gonna see that everywhere.
[03:35:18.834 --> 03:35:19.454]  Yeah, you're gonna hear it.
[03:35:20.995 --> 03:35:27.577]  The whole point of this stuff is the freedom to have it.
[03:35:27.677 --> 03:35:29.138]  If you want it, you should be able to have it.
[03:35:29.438 --> 03:35:33.299]  Most people aren't going to be out brandishing guns and open carrying or anything like that.
[03:35:33.319 --> 03:35:35.199]  It's going to be more concealed.
[03:35:35.879 --> 03:35:37.600]  This is all a hoopla.
[03:35:37.660 --> 03:35:41.661]  Didn't the criminals see the signs there that said it was a gun-free zone?
[03:35:41.761 --> 03:35:42.001]  Well, no.
[03:35:42.021 --> 03:35:42.501]  They can't read.
[03:35:42.521 --> 03:35:42.962]  They're criminals.
[03:35:44.895 --> 03:35:47.558]  Maybe that's what's been going on this entire time.
[03:35:47.598 --> 03:35:48.319]  That they just can't read.
[03:35:48.339 --> 03:35:49.300]  They can't read.
[03:35:49.320 --> 03:35:53.566]  We have to teach them to read the signs and then crime will stop.
[03:35:53.606 --> 03:35:54.006]  That's it.
[03:35:54.046 --> 03:35:57.671]  We need to really get this grassroots movement going to teach criminals how to read.
[03:35:57.711 --> 03:35:58.952]  I think that'll solve everything.
[03:35:58.972 --> 03:36:03.638]  Well, except meanwhile we have overly educated people like Hillary Clinton doing...
[03:36:04.639 --> 03:36:05.420]  We're good to go.
[03:36:21.138 --> 03:36:24.319]  Mr. and Mrs. Venezuela, turn in your guns.
[03:36:24.700 --> 03:36:38.865]  Well really, what was happening, the people in power knew that things were really about to take a turn for the worse and they wanted to disarm those people because they knew that they were going to be hungry, they were going to be angry, they were going to be getting desperate.
[03:36:39.266 --> 03:36:45.748]  Now we have reports they're having to travel like 18 hours to another country just to get food to feed their family.
[03:36:45.808 --> 03:36:48.930]  In Venezuela today, some people broke into the zoo
[03:36:49.810 --> 03:36:49.870]  Wow.
[03:36:49.890 --> 03:36:50.010]  Right.
[03:37:05.419 --> 03:37:15.164]  And so now the socialist president there, of course, has many opponents that want to see his ouster because he's ruling over this country that's just like in great despair.
[03:37:15.204 --> 03:37:18.405]  There's rioting, looting, poaching, like you mentioned.
[03:37:18.745 --> 03:37:24.208]  So now what they've done is they are destroying thousands of guns.
[03:37:24.228 --> 03:37:27.830]  They're crushing them, chopping them up, nearly 2,000 shotguns and pistols.
[03:37:27.850 --> 03:37:34.193]  That's why I need to go do this shooting competition for that, for all those guns that were brutally murdered for no reason, that did nothing at all.
[03:37:35.049 --> 03:37:38.310]  Well, and that's what they, that's, this is the, the narrative that they're pushing.
[03:37:38.490 --> 03:37:40.151]  Let me, let me know if this sounds familiar.
[03:37:40.491 --> 03:37:43.332]  We're going to bring disarmament and peace.
[03:37:44.052 --> 03:37:51.875]  Sorry, there isn't going to be any peace until you are able to get your economy stabilized, you're able to feed these people and quit lying.
[03:37:51.895 --> 03:37:55.316]  I think I need to get over to the East Coast right now immediately and build a raft.
[03:37:55.896 --> 03:37:59.820]  And try to make my way to Venezuela to escape all this freedom we have in America.
[03:38:00.280 --> 03:38:01.842]  Because, you know, it's so great over there.
[03:38:01.862 --> 03:38:03.023]  Communism is amazing.
[03:38:03.063 --> 03:38:05.885]  I think we should just all put our money into a pot.
[03:38:05.905 --> 03:38:11.130]  Let's build a raft and let's go over there now so we can, before we, you know, before we get killed over here with all this freedom.
[03:38:11.150 --> 03:38:17.496]  We should just trust that if we give our socialist government even more power, more money, they'll take care of us.
[03:38:17.816 --> 03:38:19.958]  And they'll make sure to divvy up all the goods.
[03:38:19.998 --> 03:38:21.780]  Look what happens when you have a big government.
[03:38:23.294 --> 03:38:25.437]  Milwaukee, Ferguson, look at all these places.
[03:38:26.238 --> 03:38:28.921]  Big government, you know, is over.
[03:38:29.342 --> 03:38:30.022]  It's ridiculous.
[03:38:30.062 --> 03:38:30.763]  It's not going to get any better.
[03:38:30.803 --> 03:38:38.953]  Those democratic leaders there are getting rich, putting a lot of money in their pockets, but they're not bringing any jobs to the economy, and they're sitting safely in the suburbs while their city's burning down.
[03:38:39.033 --> 03:38:41.616]  And their queen's taking all the money from everywhere, all over the country.
[03:38:41.637 --> 03:38:42.437]  Hillary Clinton.
[03:38:42.998 --> 03:38:43.118]  Right.
[03:38:43.138 --> 03:38:44.299]  You know, this is funny.
[03:38:44.339 --> 03:38:45.500]  I just want to talk about this really quick.
[03:38:45.901 --> 03:38:52.946]  There's a magazine called Glamour, I guess, and based off this article alone, I never want to look at this magazine ever again.
[03:38:53.347 --> 03:38:57.410]  But it says, yes, it's sexist to speculate about Hillary Clinton's health.
[03:38:57.530 --> 03:38:58.611]  Are you serious?
[03:38:59.071 --> 03:39:00.012]  Like that sexist?
[03:39:00.993 --> 03:39:05.436]  This is someone in the most powerful position in our country.
[03:39:05.537 --> 03:39:09.359]  She is going to be making really important decisions that are going to affect us all.
[03:39:09.820 --> 03:39:26.553]  It matters if she is going to die a year after getting put in or if she is mentally competent enough, you know, is she going to go have a seizure while she's trying to give her... And speaking of that, Dew and I actually have worked on a report while we were in Milwaukee and he's finished editing.
[03:39:26.613 --> 03:39:27.714]  It's going to be out Saturday.
[03:39:28.274 --> 03:39:37.422]  They really go in detail about Hillary Clinton's health and whether or not we should have someone like that running, a little bit of information about Senator Tim Kaine, her VP pick.
[03:39:37.903 --> 03:39:39.944]  So it's going to be a very good report.
[03:39:42.123 --> 03:39:47.527]  We've got statues of a naked Donald Trump all over, at different locations.
[03:39:48.368 --> 03:39:49.729]  But that's okay?
[03:39:50.189 --> 03:39:54.732]  But I can't say that she's a horrible human being and point out everything she's ever done wrong?
[03:39:54.972 --> 03:40:00.056]  Right, well every single election cycle that's what they do, especially if someone is an older candidate.
[03:40:00.076 --> 03:40:01.577]  They want to see their health records.
[03:40:02.938 --> 03:40:05.441]  Trump 70 could probably run a marathon right now.
[03:40:05.521 --> 03:40:06.322]  He never sleeps.
[03:40:06.642 --> 03:40:11.908]  The guy's out right now, you know, volunteering in Louisiana, helping people who have gone through hell.
[03:40:12.309 --> 03:40:19.397]  And she's taking a four-day break right now because she's old, she's weak, she's decrepit, she's haggard.
[03:40:19.938 --> 03:40:22.701]  She's just, her body's being consumed by evil.
[03:40:22.901 --> 03:40:37.429]  Now I'd love to point out how here we have this naked Trump statue everywhere, but there was another artist, I believe he was an Australian artist, he had an image of Hillary Clinton in like a string bikini, and they forced him to take it down.
[03:40:37.529 --> 03:40:41.952]  As soon as he posted that on Twitter, or I'm sorry, Instagram, his account was suspended.
[03:40:42.392 --> 03:40:43.212]  So you can put up...
[03:40:44.733 --> 03:40:45.053]  I think so.
[03:41:10.993 --> 03:41:17.197]  Like this guy literally takes it from the left, from the right, like he's getting hit on every single media outlet out there.
[03:41:17.638 --> 03:41:24.482]  Except for us, Breitbart, you know, Michael Savage, Drudge, I mean, but 90% of these people out there attacking him all the time.
[03:41:24.502 --> 03:41:27.504]  And it's just the same BS, sexist this, racist that.
[03:41:27.765 --> 03:41:29.306]  But look at all this stuff we have on Hillary.
[03:41:29.846 --> 03:41:32.488]  I mean, actual real things that we should be upset about.
[03:41:32.568 --> 03:41:43.255]  Their argument is getting neutralized, just like we saw them wear out the term racist to the point where now it's just kind of become a joke where we kind of, everyone teases each other in the hall, everything's racist.
[03:41:43.695 --> 03:41:51.140]  And now everything's gonna be sexist, it's gonna wear thin, people are getting sick and tired of being policed with this political correctness.
[03:41:51.520 --> 03:42:01.327]  Meanwhile, there are actual things that, it's not just Hillary's health, but it's also how is she gonna handle this position of power if she gets-
[03:42:01.748 --> 03:42:08.010]  How is she going to keep a country going when she couldn't even control her own husband?
[03:42:09.039 --> 03:42:12.282]  Well, when she lies under oath again and again and again.
[03:42:12.302 --> 03:42:21.849]  Now, we have, after Trump's epic speech that he gave, Politico comes out and they say, regretful Trump pivots 107 days late.
[03:42:22.089 --> 03:42:31.256]  So, they're saying, well, great that he delivered one of the most comprehensive on-message rationales for his candidacy to date, but it's too late.
[03:42:31.496 --> 03:42:33.178]  Sorry, Trump, the damage is already done.
[03:42:33.738 --> 03:42:38.401]  What about Hillary Clinton coming out and apologizing for being wrong?
[03:42:38.481 --> 03:42:43.384]  Has she come out yet and apologized to lying to the American people about her server?
[03:42:43.724 --> 03:42:47.666]  Apologizing to the families for lying to them about what happened in Benghazi?
[03:42:48.767 --> 03:42:49.607]  No, what does she do?
[03:42:49.988 --> 03:42:52.069]  She points the finger at Colin Powell.
[03:42:52.729 --> 03:42:56.952]  And says, he's the one that told me to set up my personal email.
[03:42:57.332 --> 03:42:58.813]  Really, that's the first we've heard of it.
[03:42:58.833 --> 03:43:01.715]  I just don't get this.
[03:43:02.757 --> 03:43:07.447]  How can you lie this much to people on camera and be caught?
[03:43:07.848 --> 03:43:12.097]  And she's being caught and we've made videos showing her being caught.
[03:43:12.970 --> 03:43:14.551]  And people still will vote for!
[03:43:14.571 --> 03:43:23.216]  Well, that was a... I mean, at the end of the day, do you have to hate Hillary Clinton, or do you sometimes just have to look at these stupid people that have been dumbed down, like, that's who we should be mad at.
[03:43:23.236 --> 03:43:25.577]  Like, how do you even, like, wake up in the morning?
[03:43:25.617 --> 03:43:31.140]  How do you function knowing that you actually truly believe Hillary Clinton is a good candidate?
[03:43:31.500 --> 03:43:39.025]  When you have every reason, possibly shown, and we go over it every day to tell you why you shouldn't, and you can look it up for yourself, there's, like,
[03:43:39.645 --> 03:43:42.166]  Like, you Google things like why Trump's bad.
[03:43:42.186 --> 03:43:43.386]  It's like sexist, racist, blah, blah, blah.
[03:43:43.406 --> 03:43:43.767]  Who cares?
[03:43:44.087 --> 03:43:46.188]  But there's like movies being made right now.
[03:43:46.488 --> 03:43:48.128]  All these documentaries are coming out.
[03:43:48.388 --> 03:43:51.169]  If Trump was this bad, someone make a documentary about how Trump's so bad.
[03:43:51.310 --> 03:43:58.132]  Right, he was never racist, sexist, xenophobic ever until he tried to run against the Democrats and that's their go-to.
[03:44:00.413 --> 03:44:09.060]  That's what they use, are those buzzwords, those terms, because they've weaponized those terms, and they only use it, they only use it when they need to take out their opponents.
[03:44:09.400 --> 03:44:15.205]  Perfect example of this, if we could possibly queue up the video, was the top Democratic Hillary supporter.
[03:44:15.906 --> 03:44:19.008]  She was asked several times, but do you trust Hillary?
[03:44:19.068 --> 03:44:20.449]  I mean, do you think she's trustworthy?
[03:44:20.569 --> 03:44:24.152]  And she just, she had her... Talking points.
[03:44:24.292 --> 03:44:25.533]  Memorized of what she would say.
[03:44:25.573 --> 03:44:28.195]  I mean, even people in her own party
[03:44:29.096 --> 03:44:34.540]  Can't sit there and lie to themselves and say, yeah, she's trustworthy, or yeah, I believe her.
[03:44:34.580 --> 03:44:38.702]  They just go on and say, well, she's got a lot of experience.
[03:44:40.003 --> 03:44:41.404]  I want to make an analogy real quick.
[03:44:41.824 --> 03:44:45.487]  Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party is like the human centipede.
[03:44:46.206 --> 03:44:55.189]  You know, all the people got sewed together, and she just eats all this stuff and is just, you know, just dumping all this stuff, and the rest of the people are just eating it up, and they're just passing it on to the next person.
[03:44:55.229 --> 03:44:56.989]  Like, they're completely fine.
[03:44:57.009 --> 03:45:02.931]  Meanwhile, the Democrat Party's dying, because they're all, like, leeched onto her, and they're just eating all this crap coming out of her.
[03:45:03.492 --> 03:45:09.714]  That's basically what I... I have never seen that movie, thankfully, because I didn't want that burned into my brain.
[03:45:09.734 --> 03:45:12.935]  Well, now you have Hillary Clinton's face on the front of the human centipede.
[03:45:13.075 --> 03:45:14.255]  We need to give that to them, Garrett.
[03:45:14.575 --> 03:45:15.937]  So he can make a cartoon.
[03:45:16.238 --> 03:45:17.780]  So let's go ahead and go to that video.
[03:45:17.840 --> 03:45:21.604]  This is what Hillary Clinton's own party struggles with defending her.
[03:45:22.873 --> 03:45:29.055]  At 64% of voters in a recent CNN ORC poll believe Clinton is not honest or trustworthy.
[03:45:29.255 --> 03:45:33.056]  And asked three times, Hassan would not give her opinion.
[03:45:33.156 --> 03:45:34.916]  Do you think that she's honest and trustworthy?
[03:45:35.416 --> 03:45:42.959]  I support Hillary Clinton for the presidency because her experience and her record demonstrate that she's qualified to hold the job.
[03:45:42.979 --> 03:45:43.879]  Do you think she's honest?
[03:45:44.079 --> 03:45:51.621]  She has a critical plan, among others, for making college
[03:45:53.826 --> 03:45:54.707]  Where do they program that robot at?
[03:45:54.747 --> 03:46:01.772]  I think that she has demonstrated a commitment always to something beyond herself, bigger than herself.
[03:46:02.333 --> 03:46:06.296]  That's like, that's artificial intelligence.
[03:46:06.576 --> 03:46:07.857]  How uncomfortable for her.
[03:46:07.957 --> 03:46:15.002]  Her programming, she was having to fight through that, like, must not answer whether or not I think Hillary Clinton is trustworthy.
[03:46:15.022 --> 03:46:17.024]  Issued talking points.
[03:46:17.577 --> 03:46:18.477]  Geez Louise.
[03:46:19.158 --> 03:46:20.058]  I mean, but that's how it is.
[03:46:20.098 --> 03:46:28.041]  They can just program these talking points into their political operatives, and they don't really expect that they're ever going to get questioned on these things.
[03:46:28.261 --> 03:46:32.103]  For the most part, the media is shilling for Hillary Clinton.
[03:46:32.163 --> 03:46:36.364]  Well, that's why they've got to make all that money through their foundation, so they can pay all these people to like, lie.
[03:46:36.384 --> 03:46:38.625]  Like, that lady was fighting back from beginning on.
[03:46:38.645 --> 03:46:43.327]  So you knew, like, if she even said anything outside of her talking point, that it was going to be like, no, no, no.
[03:46:43.847 --> 03:46:44.187]  Yeah.
[03:46:44.267 --> 03:46:48.149]  And then she was just gonna like walk off the stage and just kind of like just be, you know, feel better.
[03:46:48.589 --> 03:46:53.892]  But I mean, there's got to be a big check that was written for her to like stay online, stay on topic.
[03:46:53.932 --> 03:47:02.255]  It's like what position would she have heard in Hillary Clinton's White House if she just comes out here and makes a fool of herself for Hillary Clinton?
[03:47:02.275 --> 03:47:09.058]  I mean, this lady, now she has no credibility because she was totally embarrassed there on CNN.
[03:47:10.379 --> 03:47:20.119]  I mean, so it's just this is going to continue on if Hillary Clinton does get elected, except for we're probably going to see, you know, Twitter now, one of the last.
[03:47:21.272 --> 03:47:27.035]  Social media outlets where you could kind of go and see that it was going to be truthful reporting because it's in real time.
[03:47:27.355 --> 03:47:31.276]  Well now they're, just in time for a Clinton presidency, working on a new filter.
[03:47:31.797 --> 03:47:38.900]  So it's going to, just like Facebook, it's only going to give you news and information that you appear to really like.
[03:47:39.540 --> 03:47:46.243]  Not the real-time facts, not the real-time news, and they're calling it an anti-harassment quality filter.
[03:47:46.863 --> 03:47:47.924]  But I don't want to filter.
[03:47:48.864 --> 03:47:50.646]  It's called a mute and a block.
[03:47:51.046 --> 03:47:54.288]  If I don't like what you have to say, I mute you and block you immediately.
[03:47:54.348 --> 03:47:58.731]  I don't need some government tool telling me what kind of information I can access.
[03:47:58.751 --> 03:48:00.232]  I mean, I don't even block people that much.
[03:48:00.292 --> 03:48:01.553]  I mean, it's only just if it's annoying.
[03:48:01.613 --> 03:48:03.514]  I mean, if I disagree with you, I'm not going to block you.
[03:48:03.534 --> 03:48:06.636]  I kind of like to laugh at people's stupid responses.
[03:48:06.676 --> 03:48:07.477]  I think it's hilarious.
[03:48:08.197 --> 03:48:10.158]  I mean, I did block Montel Williams, though.
[03:48:10.658 --> 03:48:11.198]  Whatever his name is.
[03:48:11.218 --> 03:48:11.918]  Montel Williams.
[03:48:11.938 --> 03:48:12.738]  Yeah, that guy's annoying.
[03:48:12.899 --> 03:48:14.059]  Yeah, he and his fans.
[03:48:14.559 --> 03:48:16.180]  I know, it's just I can't deal with the trolls.
[03:48:16.220 --> 03:48:22.802]  While we're talking about Twitter, you guys can follow myself on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, at Leanne McAdoo.
[03:48:22.822 --> 03:48:24.662]  And you're Rambo Biggs, right?
[03:48:24.702 --> 03:48:26.303]  Yep, at Rambo Biggs, Twitter.com.
[03:48:26.543 --> 03:48:29.204]  And you heard it here, he enjoys the harassment.
[03:48:29.244 --> 03:48:30.504]  Oh yeah, it doesn't bother me.
[03:48:31.184 --> 03:48:31.925]  Go for it.
[03:48:32.205 --> 03:48:33.545]  It's actually like good training.
[03:48:34.105 --> 03:48:35.546]  Like, man, I take, you know,
[03:48:37.527 --> 03:48:44.152]  Yeah, you get some good defensive talking points there.
[03:48:44.512 --> 03:48:51.897]  Actually, I do believe that Paul Joseph Watson just got the Twitter checkmark.
[03:48:51.917 --> 03:48:53.358]  So he's just been verified.
[03:48:53.538 --> 03:49:01.644]  And of course, you know that they're doing that to make him... Now they're going to say, listen, you're verified now, so check your privilege.
[03:49:02.184 --> 03:49:03.125]  Don't be too...
[03:49:04.426 --> 03:49:06.788]  Don't be too bold there with what you say.
[03:49:06.808 --> 03:49:07.308]  Don't offend him.
[03:49:07.328 --> 03:49:09.110]  I was wondering if they were ever going to give it to him.
[03:49:09.130 --> 03:49:10.531]  They just did this this week.
[03:49:10.631 --> 03:49:17.476]  So Paul Joseph Watson, of course he was happy about it, but at the same time he's like, they think this is going to keep me in line.
[03:49:17.636 --> 03:49:18.677]  It's not going to work.
[03:49:19.077 --> 03:49:27.183]  So we've got, you know, Alex was really smart for setting up his own independent operation years ago where he could have sole control over what he does.
[03:49:27.223 --> 03:49:33.288]  He doesn't have to get talking points from anyone telling him how to report or, you know, what way to run the news or
[03:49:33.908 --> 03:49:37.830]  How our teleprompter needs to read because we are teleprompter free here.
[03:49:39.051 --> 03:49:39.531]  Excellent.
[03:49:40.131 --> 03:49:43.473]  Well, Joe Biggs, you're going to be with me here for the next five minutes.
[03:49:44.673 --> 03:49:58.720]  But I know tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News, we're going to have a lot of really great in-depth reporting, more on Trump's epic speech and and also the GOP prepping for a tough perjury case against Hillary Clinton.
[03:49:58.800 --> 03:49:59.601]  So this is now
[03:50:00.632 --> 03:50:01.914]  They have so much evidence.
[03:50:02.254 --> 03:50:07.821]  They're saying it could take mere weeks to get a perjury case against Hillary Clinton.
[03:50:07.881 --> 03:50:17.692]  We've seen it there with our own eyes and ears, with her lies buttressed against FBI Director James Comey's statements.
[03:50:18.553 --> 03:50:25.679]  What did you think about that, where he's basically spelling out the case against Hillary Clinton, and then at the end you're thinking, wow, they're really gonna do it!
[03:50:25.699 --> 03:50:26.580]  They're gonna come after her!
[03:50:26.620 --> 03:50:27.420]  Hillary for prison!
[03:50:27.821 --> 03:50:29.162]  And then he's like, eh, no, forget it.
[03:50:29.182 --> 03:50:30.263]  He didn't want to die.
[03:50:31.121 --> 03:50:33.644]  I mean, everyone knows about the Clinton body count.
[03:50:34.365 --> 03:50:35.046]  It's no joke.
[03:50:35.646 --> 03:50:41.954]  You know, there's been three or four that have been added to the list within the last, since the RNC.
[03:50:43.896 --> 03:50:45.898]  I think he was probably threatened or something like that.
[03:50:45.978 --> 03:50:48.722]  And it's kind of like, you know, no one's going to prosecute because no one wants to die.
[03:50:49.127 --> 03:50:54.033]  Yeah, same thing we saw with Bernie Sanders who was like, we gotta take out the establishment.
[03:50:54.314 --> 03:50:55.395]  But both for Hillary!
[03:50:55.836 --> 03:50:58.199]  People are dying, but Trump's sexist.
[03:50:58.459 --> 03:51:00.742]  I'm gonna go to my vacation home with your money.
[03:51:01.443 --> 03:51:02.324]  Thanks guys.
[03:51:02.864 --> 03:51:03.786]  Alright, we'll stick around.
[03:51:03.966 --> 03:51:06.910]  We'll have the rest of the Alex Jones Show coming up right after this.
[03:51:10.413 --> 03:51:11.793]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[03:51:11.853 --> 03:51:12.914]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:51:13.174 --> 03:51:14.114]  Why is this so good?
[03:51:14.394 --> 03:51:19.635]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:51:19.695 --> 03:51:33.259]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:51:33.319 --> 03:51:34.699]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:51:35.459 --> 03:51:37.041]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[03:51:37.121 --> 03:51:39.623]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:51:39.723 --> 03:51:40.985]  These are all parasites.
[03:51:41.025 --> 03:51:42.106]  Tell us about all the stuff it says.
[03:51:42.126 --> 03:51:43.187]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:51:43.487 --> 03:51:50.073]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood, you have enzyme blend in there.
[03:51:50.134 --> 03:51:55.339]  This is very important because a lot of these microorganisms, and even going up to tapeworms, pinworms,
[03:51:55.879 --> 03:51:58.062]  You have to disintegrate the lining.
[03:51:58.082 --> 03:52:03.088]  I mean, viruses protect themselves and so do bacteria and protozoa and mycoplasms.
[03:52:03.469 --> 03:52:07.714]  They have a protective shell that a lot of times the immune system can't even get into.
[03:52:07.915 --> 03:52:08.956]  Our own immune system.
[03:52:09.517 --> 03:52:12.220]  Especially since most people's immune system are weak anyway.
[03:52:12.921 --> 03:52:23.851]  So we actually designed the Living Defense and put in a specific blend of enzymes which actually chew and eat through the lining of these different organisms.
[03:52:24.431 --> 03:52:26.053]  So the Living Defense is amazing.
[03:52:26.493 --> 03:52:28.555]  We've seen just tremendous reviews.
[03:52:29.235 --> 03:52:31.377]  How often should you take Living Defense?
[03:52:31.397 --> 03:52:32.778]  I mean, is it a regimen every day?
[03:52:32.838 --> 03:52:34.660]  That's what I was doing until we ran out.
[03:52:35.000 --> 03:52:36.702]  Or do you do it heavier for certain cleanses?
[03:52:36.742 --> 03:52:37.543]  What do you do, Dr. Group?
[03:52:38.226 --> 03:52:49.851]  Well, I do usually six weeks at a time because if you look at the life cycle of most parasites, it's six weeks from the time... So you've got to kill the ones that are in there and then kill their babies when they hatch that job.
[03:52:50.111 --> 03:52:59.995]  If you're suffering from abdominal pain, allergies, even like headaches, anemia, weakened immune system, gut problems, depression, hair loss,
[03:53:01.075 --> 03:53:03.577]  Excess gas, muscle pain, nervousness.
[03:53:03.617 --> 03:53:04.677]  I mean, all these things.
[03:53:04.937 --> 03:53:06.038]  Doctors don't know.
[03:53:06.118 --> 03:53:09.760]  They don't teach doctors in medical school about parasites and harmful organisms.
[03:53:09.780 --> 03:53:11.921]  There's a reason why they don't teach them about that.
[03:53:12.001 --> 03:53:17.964]  Just like they don't teach doctors about the root cause of disease and how to eliminate all disease out there.
[03:53:18.024 --> 03:53:19.425]  They don't want you to know about it.
[03:53:19.685 --> 03:53:22.387]  You don't want your own immune system being attacked.
[03:53:22.667 --> 03:53:26.049]  Again, you know, you have animals, especially your cats, dogs.
[03:53:26.069 --> 03:53:27.930]  So many people have pets these days.
[03:53:28.410 --> 03:53:29.731]  People eat raw sushi.
[03:53:30.191 --> 03:53:31.813]  People eat more raw food.
[03:53:31.873 --> 03:53:36.078]  You have all these different organisms showing up in the water supplies now.
[03:53:36.558 --> 03:53:39.922]  You even have it in the air supplies, these tiny microorganisms.
[03:53:39.962 --> 03:53:42.786]  So it's not like we can get away from them.
[03:53:42.846 --> 03:53:44.307]  We just have to do everything.
[03:53:44.408 --> 03:53:45.889]  I recommend doing a parasite
[03:53:46.630 --> 03:53:48.032]  Plans at least twice a year.
[03:53:48.052 --> 03:53:51.256]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:53:51.296 --> 03:53:52.297]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:53:52.357 --> 03:53:52.878]  Living Defense.
[03:53:53.178 --> 03:53:54.240]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:53:54.280 --> 03:53:55.321]  And folks, you can't lose.
[03:53:55.341 --> 03:53:57.424]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:53:58.044 --> 03:53:59.907]  And you support the broadcast.
[03:53:59.967 --> 03:54:01.068]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:54:01.328 --> 03:54:03.231]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[03:54:03.591 --> 03:54:05.554]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:54:31.688 --> 03:54:34.072]  Alright, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:34.292 --> 03:54:37.156]  Here in the last segment, Joe Biggs joins me.
[03:54:37.296 --> 03:54:38.357]  I am Leanne McAdoo.
[03:54:38.658 --> 03:54:41.461]  Now, here's a story that we've got up at InfoWars.com right now.
[03:54:41.542 --> 03:54:43.044]  Paul Joseph Watson writes...
[03:54:43.444 --> 03:54:48.029]  Gang members chant Black Lives Matter while beating up white victims.
[03:54:48.049 --> 03:54:50.011]  So this is another racist hate crime.
[03:54:50.031 --> 03:54:53.395]  It's going to receive very little media attention.
[03:54:53.835 --> 03:54:56.318]  So this was gang members in Charleston.
[03:54:56.358 --> 03:55:00.562]  I guess they were beating up a white victim as part of an initiation ritual.
[03:55:01.083 --> 03:55:05.368]  And this story has received zero national media attention.
[03:55:05.928 --> 03:55:16.074]  So I guess the gentleman that was beaten up posted a video on Facebook relating how he was driving home before picking someone up to help them get home.
[03:55:16.094 --> 03:55:19.756]  A woman was frantically waving her arms on the side of the road.
[03:55:19.776 --> 03:55:21.618]  He offered her a ride.
[03:55:21.638 --> 03:55:27.081]  And when he arrived at the destination, his passenger stole the tip money he had on his counter.
[03:55:27.101 --> 03:55:33.305]  And when he exited the vehicle, he was immediately surrounded by two black men and had a gun put to his head.
[03:55:33.965 --> 03:55:40.947]  A member of the gang ordered the other gang members to shoot him before he was able to snatch away the gun and run back to his truck.
[03:55:42.627 --> 03:55:49.549]  Other members of the gang were there waiting for him and subjected him to a brutal beatdown that was part of a gang initiation.
[03:55:49.569 --> 03:55:51.710]  And he says it was a setup and of course it is.
[03:55:52.890 --> 03:56:02.057]  You know, there was another story that came out the other day about two teenagers who beat up a Good Samaritan after he helped them get their car out of a ditch.
[03:56:02.477 --> 03:56:04.799]  Then they shot him and killed him.
[03:56:05.200 --> 03:56:10.664]  And so, I mean, it's getting to the point where we can't ignore this violence that is kind of creeping up.
[03:56:12.018 --> 03:56:12.818]  Something happened to me.
[03:56:14.178 --> 03:56:16.439]  Just trying to do a good deed out there and they're getting hurt.
[03:56:16.499 --> 03:56:23.000]  Yeah, I was at this bar in Austin and I was going up to my truck to get something and this car pulls up right behind me.
[03:56:23.080 --> 03:56:24.180]  It's like one in the morning.
[03:56:24.720 --> 03:56:30.542]  This car pulls up, this guy gets out and has a knife and comes up to me and he goes, I need your wallet.
[03:56:30.562 --> 03:56:35.002]  I was like, well, I actually just came up to my truck to get my wallet and then I kind of said it all scared.
[03:56:35.062 --> 03:56:36.663]  I was like, well, my wallet's inside my truck.
[03:56:36.683 --> 03:56:37.563]  Can I just get it for you?
[03:56:38.904 --> 03:56:41.145]  And my truck is an arsenal.
[03:56:41.325 --> 03:56:56.737]  My truck is an arsenal and I pulled out my glock at you and put that threaded barrel right against his forehead and I told him that next time he should learn to rethink life's decisions and go get a job and do something with his life.
[03:56:56.777 --> 03:56:59.639]  I'm gonna give him a chance to live today and I told him it is a
[03:57:00.856 --> 03:57:02.358]  His girlfriend to get the hell out of there.
[03:57:03.780 --> 03:57:11.609]  Needless to say, that guy peed himself and got back into his car and left and maybe looks at life with a whole new set of eyes.
[03:57:11.629 --> 03:57:11.969]  Who knows?
[03:57:12.530 --> 03:57:13.992]  If not, if y'all run into him again.
[03:57:14.012 --> 03:57:17.155]  And of course, that situation could have ended up totally differently.
[03:57:17.176 --> 03:57:18.097]  Yeah, he would have been dead.
[03:57:19.403 --> 03:57:19.643]  You know.
[03:57:19.743 --> 03:57:20.624]  Oh yeah, with another person.
[03:57:20.704 --> 03:57:21.025]  Oh, me.
[03:57:21.125 --> 03:57:21.745]  Or with you.
[03:57:21.765 --> 03:57:25.369]  I mean, it could have ended up totally, you know, a different scenario.
[03:57:25.409 --> 03:57:26.811]  But, I mean, that's it.
[03:57:26.871 --> 03:57:32.036]  The media, they can't deny the fact that there is some stuff going on here in this country.
[03:57:32.116 --> 03:57:39.564]  And by covering it up, by saying that it's a lone, not a lone wolf, but just a lone situation with this
[03:57:41.053 --> 03:57:41.934]  The knockout game.
[03:57:42.474 --> 03:57:46.957]  Then you have people that they're just not prepared to be dealing with these situations.
[03:57:46.977 --> 03:57:58.324]  Or you get those emails sent out like, hey girls, be sure that you watch when you're getting to your car at a parking lot at night because here's this new scam that they're trying to do with women.
[03:57:58.444 --> 03:58:06.929]  And here in the media, they're failing to let people know that there's a new crime kind of going down, that it's like, good Samaritans, beware.
[03:58:06.949 --> 03:58:08.790]  I mean, this is really dangerous.
[03:58:10.120 --> 03:58:15.687]  Well Joe Biggs, I thank you so much for joining me here in the third and fourth hour.
[03:58:15.747 --> 03:58:18.270]  I know you're gonna have a lot of fun out shooting some guns.
[03:58:18.510 --> 03:58:18.931]  Pew pew!
[03:58:19.131 --> 03:58:23.817]  For America and for all those poor guns that lost their lives in Venezuela.
[03:58:24.478 --> 03:58:25.840]  I'm gonna drink to those guys tonight.
[03:58:27.318 --> 03:58:28.399]  Well, that is wonderful.
[03:58:28.459 --> 03:58:32.422]  We really appreciate your part you're doing for America.
