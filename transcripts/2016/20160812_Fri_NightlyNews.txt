[00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:22.088]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.128 --> 00:00:25.615]  It is Friday, August 12, 2016 and I'm Leigh-Anne McAdoo.
[00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:26.676]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:35.046]  Hillary's body count has finally hit the mainstream.
[00:00:35.427 --> 00:00:47.237]  Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich is demanding to know the motive behind the murder of Seth Rich, the DNC staffer responsible for the DNC email leak.
[00:00:47.537 --> 00:00:56.105]  Meanwhile, WikiLeaks is offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of Rich's killer.
[00:00:56.745 --> 00:01:05.972]  Plus, Rand Paul says Hillary Clinton could get five years in prison for lying to Congress about weapons going to ISIS.
[00:01:06.452 --> 00:01:07.072]  Is the U.S.
[00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:16.359]  involved with any procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons, buying, selling, anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey out of Libya?
[00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:17.059]  To Turkey?
[00:01:19.241 --> 00:01:23.384]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:32.206]  We have ended the big MAGA sale.
[00:01:32.646 --> 00:01:35.770]  Now, we have kept three items, though, this week.
[00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.235]  That's Rainforce Wall Supplies Last, the amazing new tropic, for $17.76, normally $29.
[00:01:41.656 --> 00:01:43.978]  Leading competitors that have similar formulas are $60 to $70 to $80.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.481]  That's 40% off.
[00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:48.522]  DNA Force, our flagship product.
[00:01:48.562 --> 00:01:50.483]  It's a big deal to offer 30% off on that.
[00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:51.664]  We're extending that.
[00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:53.566]  And then Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:56.408]  All the vitamins, all the minerals, the amino acids, the cofactors.
[00:01:56.948 --> 00:01:57.669]  Help upload it.
[00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:58.929]  Great tasting fruit punch.
[00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.310]  Info Wars.
[00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:01.511]  Life.com.
[00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:02.512]  That's 30% off.
[00:02:02.752 --> 00:02:03.573]  But I'm gonna go further.
[00:02:04.153 --> 00:02:04.453]  Boom!
[00:02:04.493 --> 00:02:04.954]  Here it is.
[00:02:04.994 --> 00:02:07.435]  Normally you sign up for auto-shipping at 10% off.
[00:02:07.516 --> 00:02:08.696]  You still get that on top of it.
[00:02:09.037 --> 00:02:10.077]  I'm doing free shipping on everything.
[00:02:10.498 --> 00:02:21.926]  Whether it's one Hillary for Prison shirt, or a Bill Clinton rape shirt, or whatever it is, whatever informational warfare weapon you want to help spread the word and meet like-minded people, free shipping store-wide.
[00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:23.567]  Free shipping store-wide.
[00:02:24.128 --> 00:02:28.711]  So I want to thank you all for your support, your prayers, and so much more.
[00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:07.681]  During a campaign stop on Thursday, Hillary Clinton gave a speech on the economy, and guess what?
[00:03:08.022 --> 00:03:10.144]  She sounded just like Donald Trump.
[00:03:10.544 --> 00:03:12.307]  And everyone is taking notice.
[00:03:13.508 --> 00:03:22.018]  I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:03:30.032 --> 00:03:35.073]  I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as president.
[00:03:36.274 --> 00:03:43.075]  So of course the TPP is a trade deal that Trump has been lambasting since before he even decided to run for president.
[00:03:43.415 --> 00:03:47.616]  Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, has been for this trade deal from the very beginning.
[00:03:48.036 --> 00:03:52.858]  Even CNN was forced to have to report on the fact that she totally flip-flopped on the issue.
[00:03:54.698 --> 00:04:02.863]  45 times she was cited advocating for this trade deal and of course in her speech she went on to basically read off of Trump's script.
[00:04:03.363 --> 00:04:09.727]  She also talked about tariffs and getting tough on China and taxing businesses that move jobs out of the country.
[00:04:10.087 --> 00:04:14.250]  Of course, the fact that she sounds just like Donald Trump didn't get by with users on Twitter.
[00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.131]  They were asking, you know, is she a Trump surrogate now?
[00:04:18.172 --> 00:04:21.033]  She kind of sees where the country, where their heart is.
[00:04:21.073 --> 00:04:23.214]  They're going with Donald Trump on a lot of these issues.
[00:04:23.775 --> 00:04:26.256]  So she is starting to try and change her tune.
[00:04:26.676 --> 00:04:31.879]  But again, she is not a very good liar because we all know she's lying if she's moving her mouth.
[00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:34.760]  Now, here's something else that there's another issue.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.002]  It's a very important issue because this one has to deal with our civil rights.
[00:04:38.502 --> 00:04:43.364]  And Hillary Clinton is basically running her campaign on the fact that she's going to take away some of your rights.
[00:04:43.404 --> 00:04:44.685]  And I'm talking about the Second Amendment.
[00:04:45.205 --> 00:04:55.436]  Now, she wants everyone to just kind of forget about the fact that she was actually caught on tape saying that the Supreme Court got it wrong on the Second Amendment.
[00:04:55.676 --> 00:04:56.957]  We weren't supposed to hear her say this.
[00:04:57.018 --> 00:05:02.964]  Someone leaked an audio recording from a private fundraiser that was hosted in Greenwich Village in 2015.
[00:05:04.105 --> 00:05:06.367]  But, you know, what the media is telling us
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.941]  That she doesn't want to repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:05:09.961 --> 00:05:12.422]  This was an article out of the Washington Post last May.
[00:05:12.743 --> 00:05:20.226]  Then they doubled down on this claim again with an op-ed titled, No, Hillary Clinton does not want to abolish the Second Amendment.
[00:05:20.747 --> 00:05:26.930]  And even at the Democratic National Convention, Hillary came out in her speech and said, I'm not here to repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.171]  I'm not here to take away your guns.
[00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:32.312]  But on that leaked audio, she was heard saying,
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.862]  Going around saying, oh, I'm not here to take away your Second Amendment.
[00:05:54.882 --> 00:05:55.583]  Don't you worry.
[00:05:55.903 --> 00:06:00.967]  But of course, that's the issue is that she is going to be the one that is putting in a new Supreme Court judge.
[00:06:01.427 --> 00:06:06.190]  And it's going to be someone that she thinks is going to get it right this time on the Second Amendment.
[00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:12.555]  And this article out of Forbes goes into great detail about her record.
[00:06:13.095 --> 00:06:15.977]  And just if you look at her record, that's the thing that's troubling.
[00:06:16.017 --> 00:06:21.121]  It's not just that we have leaked audio and video of her saying these things, but also her record.
[00:06:21.721 --> 00:06:37.512]  She's previously been in favor of gun bans, for laws that prevent law-abiding Americans from carrying concealed, for adding secret government blacklist to the national instant criminal background check system, for national gun registration, and for Australian-style gun confiscation.
[00:06:37.992 --> 00:06:40.613]  So we have video and audio recordings of more.
[00:06:40.713 --> 00:06:47.415]  She's been for pretty much every single type of gun ban or gun control idea that's ever been proposed in the U.S.
[00:06:47.595 --> 00:06:49.456]  in the last three decades.
[00:06:49.596 --> 00:06:54.958]  So this is a very pivotal election and don't let Hillary lying Clinton tell you any different.
[00:06:55.458 --> 00:07:06.426]  Something else that we're now keeping our eye on, of course, James Comey came out and basically made the case that they should have prosecuted Hillary Clinton over her emails, but then said, you know, no one would take this on.
[00:07:06.446 --> 00:07:13.531]  But he never really answered the questions from reporters there whether the FBI was going to be probing the Clinton Foundation.
[00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:17.192]  If there was any wrongdoing while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.
[00:07:17.552 --> 00:07:25.336]  But indeed, now according to a former senior law enforcement official, multiple FBI investigations are underway.
[00:07:25.936 --> 00:07:30.678]  This is, of course, involving potential corruption charges against the Clinton Foundation.
[00:07:31.098 --> 00:07:34.639]  The New York-based probe is being led by Preet Bharara.
[00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:35.339]  He's a U.S.
[00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:37.920]  attorney for the Southern District of New York.
[00:07:39.401 --> 00:07:39.841]  I think so.
[00:08:01.458 --> 00:08:03.819]  Some justice being served here.
[00:08:04.339 --> 00:08:14.681]  Now, just to kind of give you a little bit of background, in its 15 years of operations, the Clinton Foundation has collected up to $2 billion from donors.
[00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:16.661]  This is according to the Washington Post.
[00:08:16.981 --> 00:08:27.603]  The donors include a wide range of the world's wealthiest people, Eastern European tycoons, Arab sheiks, African mining magnates, hedge fund billionaires, and Wall Street firms.
[00:08:28.103 --> 00:08:33.888]  The Post reports that the couple brought in $3 billion when campaign contributions are included in that total.
[00:08:33.989 --> 00:08:42.496]  So their fundraising operation, this is $3 billion amassed by one couple working in tandem for more than four decades.
[00:08:43.177 --> 00:08:43.557]  I think so.
[00:09:06.098 --> 00:09:09.959]  How they have to now alert the FBI if anyone has suspicious banking activity.
[00:09:09.979 --> 00:09:13.460]  And here, you know, you're saying it might be snagging the Clintons.
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:19.142]  But of course, the investigation, they were kind of going back and forth.
[00:09:19.222 --> 00:09:20.082]  Should we open this?
[00:09:20.182 --> 00:09:20.803]  Should we not?
[00:09:20.823 --> 00:09:26.744]  It was the FBI and the Justice Department officials meeting talking about whether they should go ahead with this investigation.
[00:09:27.465 --> 00:09:28.745]  But there was disagreement.
[00:09:29.025 --> 00:09:31.327]  And in the end, the investigation was killed.
[00:09:31.707 --> 00:09:38.172]  So, of course, you know, they're very powerful people wanting to shut down any kind of probing into the Clinton Foundation.
[00:09:38.192 --> 00:09:42.096]  Maybe the disagreement was because they didn't want to end up like Seth Rich.
[00:09:42.676 --> 00:09:50.823]  Now, of course, Seth Rich was the DNC staffer who Julian Assange kind of suggested could be the source of those DNC email leaks.
[00:09:51.403 --> 00:09:53.524]  Rich was gunned down in Washington, D.C.
[00:09:53.584 --> 00:09:55.764]  last month in unexplained circumstances.
[00:09:56.125 --> 00:10:03.727]  His killer not taking any of Rich's possessions or money, even though it's still being treated like a robbery attempt.
[00:10:03.767 --> 00:10:09.829]  And of course, WikiLeaks has offered a $20,000 reward for any information leading to the conviction of his killer.
[00:10:10.569 --> 00:10:23.717]  Well, Newt Gingrich went on the Mike Gallagher Show, and he was basically saying that the claims by the media that this entire story was just a conspiracy theory is absurd, and that of course it's worth talking about.
[00:10:23.837 --> 00:10:24.437]  Take a listen.
[00:10:25.097 --> 00:10:26.738]  First of all, of course it's worth talking about.
[00:10:27.839 --> 00:10:31.401]  And if the science says it's the source of science, I mean, no.
[00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:33.943]  You know, that's not complicated.
[00:10:36.244 --> 00:10:39.846]  Whether it has any meaning in the presidential campaign, I don't know, but obviously
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.522]  Look, I'm old-fashioned.
[00:10:44.862 --> 00:10:48.186]  I think not only do black lives matter, I think all American lives matter.
[00:10:48.546 --> 00:10:54.052]  And if somebody was gunned down in our national capital, we ought to have a pretty passionate interest in knowing why.
[00:10:54.562 --> 00:10:58.464]  And if it clearly wasn't a mugging and it wasn't for money, what was it for?
[00:10:59.304 --> 00:11:05.527]  As we reported yesterday, the family of Seth Rich was initially calling on people to help them find his murderer.
[00:11:06.087 --> 00:11:08.648]  Rich's family have now hired Brad Bowman.
[00:11:08.688 --> 00:11:14.691]  He's a public relations manager who specializes in crisis communications for the Democratic Party.
[00:11:15.051 --> 00:11:20.172]  Bowman's primary concern seems to be silencing suspicions over Rich's murder.
[00:11:20.652 --> 00:11:29.755]  And last night, a prominent source close to the Democratic Party actually got in touch with Paul Joseph Watson and said that he was right on the money with his reporting on this issue.
[00:11:30.075 --> 00:11:33.716]  So I'm sure that this is not the last we're going to hear about this story.
[00:11:34.256 --> 00:11:35.196]  Now, do you remember this?
[00:11:36.101 --> 00:11:36.723]  Is the U.S.
[00:11:36.783 --> 00:11:46.023]  involved with any procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons, buying, selling, anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey out of Libya?
[00:11:49.076 --> 00:11:49.776]  To Turkey?
[00:11:50.637 --> 00:11:54.818]  So that testimony that Hillary Clinton didn't know might come back to bite her.
[00:11:55.039 --> 00:11:57.540]  What difference does it make at this point, though, am I right?
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:03.762]  WikiLeaks is now saying that they have emails that prove Hillary did know about this weapons transfer.
[00:12:04.222 --> 00:12:09.204]  Rand Paul joined Eric Bolling to reply to WikiLeaks' assertion.
[00:12:10.365 --> 00:12:15.027]  Now if WikiLeaks in fact does have emails proving that she did know, what does that mean to you?
[00:12:16.963 --> 00:12:18.564]  It's a felony to lie to Congress.
[00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:20.126]  You can get five years in prison.
[00:12:20.566 --> 00:12:23.449]  And we can't continue to say that the Clintons are above the law.
[00:12:24.049 --> 00:12:35.559]  I do believe that the CIA annex in Benghazi was procuring weapons, some of them to get them away from the jihadists in Libya, but some of it to ferry those weapons through Turkey into Syria.
[00:12:36.019 --> 00:12:52.186]  And Rand Paul also pointed out, reminding everyone that most of the mainstream media was telling everyone that Hillary Clinton was actually the biggest advocate for arming the Islamic rebels, who of course turned out to be defectors, enemies of the US, or now ISIS.
[00:12:53.426 --> 00:12:57.408]  They blew up all the infrastructure, turned Al-Qaeda loose to run around murdering everybody.
[00:12:57.428 --> 00:13:04.831]  Now Al-Qaeda has spilt all the way into Central Africa, all the way into Western Africa, and is just running around murdering everyone.
[00:13:06.039 --> 00:13:07.561]  All run by Hillary Clinton!
[00:13:07.981 --> 00:13:10.924]  We let ISIS take this position.
[00:13:11.564 --> 00:13:17.410]  It was Hillary Clinton that she should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS.
[00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:20.753]  Oh, ABC's cut out right there.
[00:13:21.073 --> 00:13:24.897]  And they are now moving forward, rolling forward with massive censorship.
[00:13:25.117 --> 00:13:28.901]  She gets up there and she says, you know ISIS is using Donald Trump videos.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.724]  He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter.
[00:13:35.005 --> 00:13:37.487]  You heard the CIA whistleblowers like Tosh Plumlee.
[00:13:37.747 --> 00:13:39.249]  He had to retire when he came on the show.
[00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:46.096]  You heard them all say that she's running through the State Department a program with billions of dollars back to her foundation.
[00:13:46.977 --> 00:13:47.577]  ISIS is honoring
[00:14:05.547 --> 00:14:06.508]  President Obama.
[00:14:07.128 --> 00:14:09.510]  He is the founder of ISIS.
[00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:10.631]  He's the founder of ISIS.
[00:14:11.232 --> 00:14:25.282]  When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, we had this brilliant idea that we were going to come to Pakistan and create a force of Mujahideen, equip them with Stinger missiles and everything else, to go after the Soviets inside Afghanistan.
[00:14:25.963 --> 00:14:27.144]  And we were successful.
[00:14:27.344 --> 00:14:32.328]  I would say the co-founder would be crooked Hillary Clinton.
[00:14:33.237 --> 00:14:47.521]  This can't really be happening that Hillary Clinton's probably going to be our next president when she's such a criminal gangster, so evil, such a fraud, and armed Al Qaeda and ran the whole strategy to destabilize Africa and the Middle East.
[00:14:47.901 --> 00:14:51.242]  The people we are fighting today we funded 20 years ago.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:58.224]  Well, voters have come to expect the mainstream media tilting the American elections.
[00:14:58.504 --> 00:15:05.590]  But what's new about this presidential election season is that social media and even video games are getting in on the act.
[00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:07.951]  And this is coming out of The Observer.
[00:15:08.892 --> 00:15:09.932]  Excellent reporting here.
[00:15:10.273 --> 00:15:14.034]  They talk about the propaganda skewing running much deeper than just the media.
[00:15:14.134 --> 00:15:20.957]  Our iPhones, iPads, social media networks, Google, and even video games are all in the tank for Hillary Clinton.
[00:15:21.397 --> 00:15:22.357]  It is chilling.
[00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:26.099]  So it goes on to talk about an interview that the writer was
[00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:39.509]  Conducting on Magapod, which is a pro-Trump podcast, and the show's host, Mark Hamill, was disappointed because Apple would not run his show without an explicit warning label.
[00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:48.356]  His podcast didn't contain any explicit content under Apple's policy, so he checked in to say, you know, why is this happening?
[00:15:48.416 --> 00:15:52.540]  Most other news in the news and politics category isn't labeled as such.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.222]  So on June 18th, he spoke to a representative from Apple.
[00:15:56.282 --> 00:16:05.889]  She explained, since the description of his show is pro-Trump, his show is explicit in nature because the subject matter is Donald Trump.
[00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:06.910]  Whoa!
[00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:14.756]  Meanwhile, Apple has dozens of podcasts discussing Osama bin Laden or Adolf Hitler, and those don't have an explicit warning.
[00:16:14.816 --> 00:16:21.821]  So here is Apple basically telling anyone who wants to watch this podcast that the Republican presidential candidate is explicit.
[00:16:23.121 --> 00:16:31.005]  Also, Apple has twice refused to publish a satire Clinton email-gate game called Capitol Hillary.
[00:16:31.405 --> 00:16:34.406]  They claimed that it was offensive and mean-spirited.
[00:16:34.926 --> 00:16:46.031]  And this is, you know, Apple, who has approved dozens of games poking fun at Donald Trump, including a game called Dump Trump, where he is a giant turd, basically.
[00:16:46.111 --> 00:16:51.373]  And then so it goes on to just talk about iPhone and iPad going into the Apple News.
[00:16:51.733 --> 00:16:58.038]  So if you have it on your phone and you're wanting to get those news updates, the algorithms are total leftist propaganda.
[00:16:58.599 --> 00:17:07.166]  And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has also said that Clinton made a deal with Google and that the tech giant is directly engaged in her campaign.
[00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:14.852]  It's been widely reported that Clinton hired Eric Schmidt, who is the chairman of Alphabet, which is now the parent company of Google.
[00:17:14.972 --> 00:17:18.215]  She had him set up a tech company called The Groundwork.
[00:17:18.835 --> 00:17:24.019]  Assange claims that this was to ensure Clinton had the engineering talent to win the election.
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:28.263]  Of course, a lot of people on Clinton's staff have worked for Google.
[00:17:28.503 --> 00:17:31.365]  Some of her former employees now work for Google.
[00:17:31.646 --> 00:17:33.267]  So it's that same revolving door.
[00:17:33.888 --> 00:17:35.389]  And so that's no surprise.
[00:17:35.549 --> 00:17:41.834]  We've had multiple reports accusing Google of manipulating the searches to bury negative stories about Clinton.
[00:17:42.194 --> 00:17:46.218]  And then, of course, if you search for Donald Trump, Google will also pull up
[00:17:46.678 --> 00:17:52.181]  Adolf Hitler right there just to kind of just get that in people's heads that Trump is literally Hitler.
[00:17:52.822 --> 00:18:00.006]  Just yesterday it was revealed that Twitter's top executive personally protected the president from seeing any critical messages last year.
[00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:10.152]  And of course this year we're seeing Twitter not only banning conservatives but they've also changed their algorithms to promote Clinton while giving negative exposure to Trump.
[00:18:10.272 --> 00:18:14.274]  Of course they're burying pro-Trump Twitter handles as well as hashtags.
[00:18:14.714 --> 00:18:17.077]  And that's why the people are in active revolt.
[00:18:17.277 --> 00:18:18.398]  Even this guy.
[00:18:18.418 --> 00:18:23.503]  I am a patriot, and you are a traitor!
[00:18:23.663 --> 00:18:24.664]  Patriot!
[00:18:24.924 --> 00:18:29.849]  American patriot!
[00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:32.152]  Your name is...
[00:18:45.444 --> 00:18:46.485]  I'm running for president.
[00:18:46.865 --> 00:18:50.068]  Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.
[00:18:50.348 --> 00:18:54.471]  I'm hitting the road to earn your vote, and I hope you'll join me on this journey.
[00:19:14.161 --> 00:19:17.742]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:19:17.762 --> 00:19:20.122]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:19:20.482 --> 00:19:24.003]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:19:24.043 --> 00:19:27.204]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:19:27.704 --> 00:19:32.465]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:19:33.025 --> 00:19:34.905]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:19:35.245 --> 00:19:39.686]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:41.867]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:19:42.507 --> 00:19:43.967]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:19:44.127 --> 00:19:44.367]  Exactly.
[00:19:44.387 --> 00:19:48.209]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:19:48.709 --> 00:19:56.733]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:20:02.028 --> 00:20:05.090]  We have ended the big mega sale, the biggest in our history.
[00:20:05.511 --> 00:20:08.653]  Now, we have kept three items, though, this week.
[00:20:09.033 --> 00:20:14.097]  That's Brain Force, while supplies last, the amazing Nootropic for $17.76, normally $29.
[00:20:14.517 --> 00:20:16.839]  Leading competitors that have similar formulas are $60 to $70 to $80.
[00:20:16.899 --> 00:20:20.041]  So we're already a great deal at that price.
[00:20:20.121 --> 00:20:22.863]  It has some ingredients that are controlled or prescription in Europe.
[00:20:23.224 --> 00:20:24.324]  That's how powerful it is.
[00:20:24.745 --> 00:20:26.826]  Read about it for yourself at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:20:28.027 --> 00:20:28.907]  That's 40% off.

[00:20:31.008 --> 00:20:32.929]  It's a big deal to offer 30% off on that.
[00:20:34.189 --> 00:20:35.070]  We're extending that.
[00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:36.970]  And then Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:20:37.031 --> 00:20:41.072]  All the vitamins, all the minerals, the amino acids, the cofactors to help upload it.
[00:20:41.112 --> 00:20:42.313]  Great tasting fruit punch.
[00:20:42.973 --> 00:20:43.933]  Organically flavored.
[00:20:44.333 --> 00:20:46.114]  There's nothing else out there like it.
[00:20:46.174 --> 00:20:46.774]  It's amazing.
[00:20:47.094 --> 00:20:48.255]  It's plant-derived minerals.
[00:20:49.577 --> 00:20:52.478]  InfoWarsLive.com, that's 30% off.
[00:20:52.738 --> 00:20:53.599]  But I'm gonna go further.
[00:20:54.139 --> 00:20:54.939]  Boom, here it is.
[00:20:54.999 --> 00:20:57.440]  Normally you sign up for auto-ship, you get 10% off.
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:58.700]  You still get that on top of it.

[00:21:19.815 --> 00:21:22.956]  You can get 30% off on DNA Force.
[00:21:23.696 --> 00:21:25.376]  I'm not going to sit here and belabor this.
[00:21:25.616 --> 00:21:43.101]  People should really go read and see the hundreds of studies that are there breaking down just what BioPQQ does and why this is such an amazing nutraceutical.
[00:21:44.144 --> 00:21:49.727]  And why it's so important that folks take it daily, because the compounds in this are just amazing.
[00:21:49.767 --> 00:21:51.088]  I mean, you just know they're from God.
[00:21:52.329 --> 00:21:53.470]  But I'm not going to get into the science.
[00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:55.211]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:55.611 --> 00:22:01.395]  Go there to the page for yourself, and you can check it all out at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:01.435 --> 00:22:09.400]  InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site, and your purchases make it possible, everything we do here.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.962]  So I want to thank you all for your support, your prayers,
[00:22:14.426 --> 00:22:15.227]  And so much more.
[00:22:36.306 --> 00:22:42.052]  If there's any mention of a disease or anything in there, it can't go up online because of the regulations with the FDA.
[00:22:42.132 --> 00:22:45.695]  So, please feel free to call in as much as you want.
[00:22:45.875 --> 00:22:48.078]  We love hearing about your stories.
[00:22:48.658 --> 00:22:58.548]  And this is just DNA for us, but, you know, the best thing that I love to do and the best thing I tell people to do is just go online to Infowarslife.com and just read all the reviews.
[00:23:11.158 --> 00:23:15.622]  Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish, the Second Amendment.
[00:23:15.662 --> 00:23:24.791]  By the way, and if she gets to pick... If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks.
[00:23:26.772 --> 00:23:29.275]  Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know.
[00:23:31.016 --> 00:23:33.438]  From my cold, dead hands...
[00:23:37.427 --> 00:23:48.972]  Anybody that wants to make me unarmed and helpless, people that want to literally create the proven places where more innocents are killed called gun-free zones, we're gonna beat you.
[00:23:49.192 --> 00:23:52.073]  We're gonna vote you out of office or suck on my machine gun.
[00:23:52.113 --> 00:23:59.316]  That's why you're going to fail and the establishment knows, no matter how much propaganda, the Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[00:23:59.556 --> 00:24:00.056]  I've had enough.
[00:24:00.116 --> 00:24:01.917]  Let me explain something to the New World Order, okay?
[00:24:02.617 --> 00:24:05.538]  You're not getting our guns.
[00:24:05.818 --> 00:24:07.658]  1776 started when you tried to get them, you bastards.
[00:24:08.138 --> 00:24:13.399]  And as Charlton Heston famously said, from my cold dead hand, you sons of bitches!
[00:24:13.839 --> 00:24:14.479]  You got that?
[00:24:14.859 --> 00:24:17.080]  You're not getting our firearms!
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.480]  Do you understand?
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.881]  This far and no further with your damn dictatorship!
[00:24:22.361 --> 00:24:23.141]  I'm sick of it!
[00:24:23.481 --> 00:24:27.442]  You know, the right to bear arms is because that's the last form of defense against tyranny.
[00:24:29.636 --> 00:24:37.379]  To say we're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down, if you want to come and take them!
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:49.425]  Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, Mao took the guns, Fidel Castro took the guns, Hugo Chavez took the guns, and I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[00:24:49.645 --> 00:24:58.289]  I must tell you, the right to defend yourself, the right to keep and bear arms, does not protect your right to shoot deer.
[00:24:59.761 --> 00:25:04.763]  It protects your right to shoot at the government when it is taken over by tyrants.
[00:25:05.243 --> 00:25:15.326]  These are... The quintessential American right.
[00:25:16.726 --> 00:25:18.167]  The right to be left alone.
[00:25:27.776 --> 00:25:31.077]  But you know you were lying and implying there's no election fraud or no voter fraud.
[00:25:31.097 --> 00:25:32.298]  That was ridiculous.
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:37.800]  Now here's James O'Keefe's piece.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:43.123]  Let's put the article up on screen for TV viewers so I can list it for radio listeners so they want to go see the video at Project Veritas' website.
[00:25:43.163 --> 00:25:45.604]  We should probably repost this to Project Veritas.
[00:25:45.624 --> 00:25:47.845]  So James O'Keefe obtains Eminem's ballot.
[00:25:49.325 --> 00:25:49.886]  Now get ready.
[00:25:49.906 --> 00:25:53.587]  He's coming in to get Eminem's ballot where they have a record of it so he can go be Eminem.
[00:25:53.627 --> 00:25:56.869]  He's stealing his identity right here on television for you right now.
[00:26:00.875 --> 00:26:01.215]  Hello.
[00:26:15.563 --> 00:26:17.445]  The name is Marshall Bruce Mathers.
[00:26:18.566 --> 00:26:22.991]  Oh, you know what?
[00:26:23.091 --> 00:26:27.156]  I don't have a driver's license with me.
[00:26:27.256 --> 00:26:27.656]  I don't.
[00:26:27.836 --> 00:26:28.577]  I left.
[00:26:28.697 --> 00:26:29.518]  I came from work.
[00:26:29.538 --> 00:26:31.881]  I don't have my wallet, but the name is Marshall.
[00:26:32.801 --> 00:26:34.483]  So I can still vote?
[00:26:34.503 --> 00:26:36.845]  All I gotta do is fill this out?
[00:26:50.657 --> 00:26:54.760]  That's right, you can go into Travis County and say you're Alex Jones, I guess, and vote.
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.541]  But I don't have a driver's license.
[00:26:56.561 --> 00:26:57.181]  That's all right.
[00:26:57.281 --> 00:26:59.303]  If you don't have it on you, you're a poor man.
[00:26:59.383 --> 00:26:59.603]  Yeah.
[00:26:59.623 --> 00:27:00.584]  That's why you're signing this.
[00:27:00.764 --> 00:27:03.445]  If you don't have a driver's license, just make up any name you want.
[00:27:03.465 --> 00:27:05.787]  Then you have to fill out your information with your name.
[00:27:05.827 --> 00:27:07.288]  Bob Jones, Tabler, Alvin.
[00:27:07.308 --> 00:27:09.950]  My middle name is Bruce, and I have a suffix, the third.
[00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:13.212]  If that is the middle name, I could just marshal Bruce Mathers, the third.
[00:27:13.252 --> 00:27:14.273]  They'll find you.
[00:27:14.313 --> 00:27:15.253]  They'll find you in there.
[00:27:15.293 --> 00:27:17.155]  But you have to fill it out.
[00:27:18.095 --> 00:27:18.916]  Okay, you'll look it up.
[00:27:19.517 --> 00:27:20.318]  Alright.
[00:27:20.598 --> 00:27:23.081]  The last name is Mathers, M-A-T-H-E-R-S.
[00:27:23.822 --> 00:27:24.743]  First name is Marshall.
[00:27:26.725 --> 00:27:28.307]  So, you guys will let me vote.
[00:27:28.947 --> 00:27:31.570]  Marshall, Bruce Mathers, all I gotta do is sign this thing here.
[00:27:32.031 --> 00:27:32.732]  Fill both sides.
[00:27:33.092 --> 00:27:34.053]  Fill both things out.
[00:27:34.213 --> 00:27:35.955]  The birthday is October 17th, 1972.
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:41.381]  I know.
[00:27:41.421 --> 00:27:42.421]  That's a great thing there.
[00:27:42.461 --> 00:27:43.382]  I mean, you know, I was worried.
[00:27:43.402 --> 00:27:44.362]  I didn't have my ID.
[00:27:44.562 --> 00:27:44.883]  What's that?
[00:27:44.903 --> 00:27:46.964]  You have a really nice name.
[00:27:47.044 --> 00:27:47.144]  Oh.
[00:27:47.224 --> 00:27:50.366]  Are you related to a certain somebody named Marshall Miller?
[00:27:50.566 --> 00:27:55.108]  Oh, everyone always says that, but, you know, it's, uh... I didn't even know he's a rapper.
[00:27:55.148 --> 00:27:55.368]  Right?
[00:27:55.708 --> 00:27:55.989]  Yeah.
[00:27:56.049 --> 00:27:56.309]  Yeah.
[00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:57.630]  Yeah, he lives in the area.
[00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:00.451]  Well, that last caller really asked for it.
[00:28:00.471 --> 00:28:01.852]  We're gonna hit him hard.
[00:28:01.872 --> 00:28:03.713]  You know, I just... I have a phone call.
[00:28:03.753 --> 00:28:04.453]  I'll be right back.
[00:28:04.493 --> 00:28:05.394]  Just give me one second.
[00:28:05.874 --> 00:28:06.374]  Yo, shut up.
[00:28:07.155 --> 00:28:08.736]  Yeah, I'm voting right now.
[00:28:09.656 --> 00:28:12.518]  I know we gotta squash that beef, but I'm voting right now.
[00:28:13.719 --> 00:28:15.079]  Yeah, I know, I know.
[00:28:15.099 --> 00:28:17.841]  I thought I needed an ID too, but they don't need it.
[00:28:18.081 --> 00:28:19.562]  Alright, I gotta go.
[00:28:20.402 --> 00:28:20.943]  That kills me.
[00:28:30.417 --> 00:28:36.406]  Now, I'm going to go back to your calls.
[00:28:36.807 --> 00:28:39.631]  I'm not going to let that guy who was disagreeing dominate everything.
[00:28:39.691 --> 00:28:40.532]  But, I mean, that's what I mean.
[00:28:40.592 --> 00:28:43.537]  He's just slithering around, lying, knowing he was lying.
[00:28:44.997 --> 00:28:55.427]  Just go to Google, even though they game a lot of this, and just type in voter fraud or election fraud or engineer testifies on election fraud.
[00:28:55.448 --> 00:29:00.553]  I mean, it's just, there's literally hundreds of news articles, hundreds of videos.
[00:29:02.469 --> 00:29:06.270]  Quite frankly, a few weeks ago I started pushing the initiative to expose all this, as you've noticed nationally.
[00:29:06.731 --> 00:29:07.831]  Trump talking about it as well.
[00:29:08.711 --> 00:29:12.493]  And I started watching the videos and reading the articles and I thought I knew all of it.
[00:29:12.513 --> 00:29:14.994]  There was so much stuff I couldn't even keep track of it.
[00:29:16.594 --> 00:29:18.135]  Bloomberg, how to hack an election.
[00:29:19.956 --> 00:29:21.276]  All the fraud in Latin America.
[00:29:23.337 --> 00:29:25.178]  I'll tell you this, at least you talk to the average Latin American.
[00:29:25.658 --> 00:29:26.998]  Of course there's election fraud.
[00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:30.960]  Only weirdo Democrats would sit there and deny it.
[00:29:34.599 --> 00:29:35.680]  Here's a little news flash for you.
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:39.082]  Al Gore won the 2000 election.
[00:29:40.642 --> 00:29:41.043]  Al Gore.
[00:29:42.363 --> 00:29:42.964]  I hate Al Gore.
[00:29:44.745 --> 00:29:46.446]  But there was fraud.
[00:29:47.306 --> 00:29:50.828]  And Stone was the number two guy under James Baker running that recount.
[00:29:52.509 --> 00:29:52.910]  Number two.
[00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:56.532]  And he's apologized for it and said it was wrong and he's very ashamed of it.
[00:29:56.812 --> 00:29:59.333]  He changed course two years after with the Iraq war and went public.
[00:30:00.174 --> 00:30:01.314]  That's why I like Stone.
[00:30:01.334 --> 00:30:01.915]  He's a real deal.
[00:30:03.243 --> 00:30:05.225]  I should have Stone on to tell us about election fraud.
[00:30:05.285 --> 00:30:06.506]  I did in the first hour.
[00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:16.536]  But, I mean, this is the type of crap I deal with all day long because they know they're lying, but it's like CNN anchors.
[00:30:16.817 --> 00:30:22.562]  They get up there and they pretend and all convince themselves and then think because they call in and tell us the sky isn't blue.
[00:30:22.582 --> 00:30:23.383]  And I love that tactic.
[00:30:24.524 --> 00:30:25.846]  Prove to me a blue whale exists.
[00:30:26.126 --> 00:30:26.787]  Show me one now.
[00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:30.374]  I'm like, dude, election fraud and voter fraud is well known.
[00:30:30.414 --> 00:30:31.916]  It's like saying, show me the blue sky.
[00:30:32.316 --> 00:30:34.299]  It's right above me, but I don't have to show it to you.
[00:30:34.319 --> 00:30:40.548]  It's like, prove to me that Abraham Lincoln was the Republican president born in Illinois.
[00:30:41.664 --> 00:30:43.926]  Prove to me the Civil War happened and Robert E. Lee existed!
[00:30:44.506 --> 00:30:46.048]  Prove to me there was ever a Second Amendment!
[00:30:46.388 --> 00:30:47.749]  Prove to me there was ever a First Amendment!
[00:30:47.929 --> 00:30:48.570]  Prove to me!
[00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:49.430]  Prove to me!
[00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:49.951]  Hey, Alex.
[00:30:50.691 --> 00:30:51.692]  Yes, yes, Matt.
[00:30:51.712 --> 00:30:52.373]  I wanted you to pop in.
[00:30:52.393 --> 00:30:52.773]  Go ahead.
[00:30:52.953 --> 00:30:57.637]  You said that, you know, he must have been a Democrat because he doesn't believe in voter fraud.
[00:30:57.957 --> 00:31:05.123]  But I bet if Trump wins, all the Democrats are going to come out the woodwork just saying, hey, it had to have been election fraud.
[00:31:05.143 --> 00:31:06.064]  It had to have been voter fraud.
[00:31:07.014 --> 00:31:07.354]  I agree.
[00:31:07.994 --> 00:31:10.815]  Do we have any shortage of proof of election or voter fraud, Matt?
[00:31:10.835 --> 00:31:12.176]  I mean, we could spend 10 hours on it.
[00:31:13.156 --> 00:31:18.238]  Our bin has close to 20 videos of election fraud.
[00:31:18.838 --> 00:31:19.819]  And that's in the past two months.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.820]  What did you make of his call, though?
[00:31:27.816 --> 00:31:29.857]  It's not the first time I haven't heard something like that.
[00:31:30.838 --> 00:31:41.344]  I actually have gone back and forth with one of my old roommates about election fraud, and he actually kind of came at it from the same angle, because it's not very widely reported on in the mainstream.
[00:31:42.045 --> 00:31:45.407]  And actually before I started... Yeah, because they've made the law where you just walk in...
[00:31:46.207 --> 00:31:47.889]  And take over somebody's identity and vote.
[00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:52.113]  Oh yeah, and you know, it was shocking for me once we started digging into it.
[00:31:52.173 --> 00:31:58.739]  Just a little bit of searching on the internet will uncover all these instances where people are just going nuts.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:07.208]  And the reason why I recommended that James O'Keefe video is just how blatant, how easy it is to go in and commit voter fraud.
[00:32:07.508 --> 00:32:08.289]  It's hilarious.
[00:32:10.168 --> 00:32:11.448]  Well, other points on this.
[00:32:11.608 --> 00:32:15.850]  I mean, do you like my idea of taking that call and then just chopping it full of news articles and video clips?
[00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:16.330]  Oh yeah.
[00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:22.852]  No, that right there would be a powerful thing to share with everybody because there are people who don't believe it out there.
[00:32:22.872 --> 00:32:23.972]  That's kind of the sad truth.
[00:32:24.392 --> 00:32:29.834]  You know, people just don't believe because, you know what, again, they're people who are good-minded people.
[00:32:29.934 --> 00:32:31.474]  They wouldn't think to go do that themselves.
[00:32:31.494 --> 00:32:35.936]  I agree those exist, Matt, but with this guy, the Democrats are the kings of retail low-level fraud.
[00:32:37.216 --> 00:32:42.600]  And so they always, every year, every election year, they run around and say it doesn't exist.
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.021]  You gotta think like a criminal.
[00:32:44.262 --> 00:32:44.922]  That's the thing.
[00:32:45.062 --> 00:32:46.183]  You gotta think like a criminal.
[00:32:46.483 --> 00:32:48.044]  Rachel Maddow wears purple glasses.
[00:32:48.284 --> 00:32:50.026]  Doesn't that mean she's smarter than us?
[00:33:02.523 --> 00:33:07.988]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[00:33:08.528 --> 00:33:09.029]  Unveiled!
[00:33:09.449 --> 00:33:12.492]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula.
[00:33:13.173 --> 00:33:13.633]  30 servings.
[00:33:13.833 --> 00:33:16.436]  Fruit punch flavor dietary supplement.
[00:33:16.756 --> 00:33:17.797]  It is simply amazing.
[00:33:17.877 --> 00:33:18.818]  Infowarslife.com
[00:33:19.198 --> 00:33:23.600]  There's a million different products like this out there, but they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:37.227]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all the essential amino acids, all the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:38.808]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:40.029]  I put it in my protein shake.
[00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:46.133]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:49.175]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:51.456]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[00:33:52.057 --> 00:33:58.201]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:00.783]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[00:34:01.143 --> 00:34:03.004]  Okay, this... Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:05.346]  Yeah, this... I wanna... But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:05.726]  Yeah.
[00:34:05.946 --> 00:34:07.447]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:10.349]  There's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com that are excellent.
[00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:11.909]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.152]  This is just the very best we can bring you, and when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:39.919]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body, because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:41.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:41.087 --> 00:34:44.228]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[00:34:44.328 --> 00:34:45.568]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:46.168]  Tell folks about that.
[00:34:46.328 --> 00:34:49.088]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.589]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:55.670]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine.
[00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.510]  Each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.131]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:04.691]  34 other ones you can check out.
[00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.731]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:09.552]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:19.939]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just by the way look on the other side too because we're showing people the minerals and things let's look at the vitamins right there old Scott in there I mean it's amazing.
[00:35:19.979 --> 00:35:20.440]  Top left.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.862]  Again if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.285]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's the other source?
[00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.707]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:32.806]  Retinol.
[00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:37.328]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[00:35:37.649 --> 00:35:38.049]  And you know what?
[00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:40.290]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.110]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:48.154]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:53.997]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:55.358]  So get them today!

[00:36:00.442 --> 00:36:01.983]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:36:02.363 --> 00:36:08.288]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[00:36:08.508 --> 00:36:09.649]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:25.219]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:29.582]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:36:33.604 --> 00:36:40.690]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:36:41.031 --> 00:36:46.696]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:36:46.896 --> 00:36:53.022]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[00:36:53.322 --> 00:36:57.065]  Check them out today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[00:37:04.346 --> 00:37:07.769]  This is Ashley Beckford reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:37:08.229 --> 00:37:19.298]  I'm here to talk to you about the fact that there seems to be a different set of rules for the elite or, you know, the globalists, if you want to call them that, versus the rest of us.
[00:37:19.818 --> 00:37:20.138]  I think so.
[00:37:36.235 --> 00:37:41.482]  Marijuana is currently under Schedule 1, meaning that it has a high potential for abuse.
[00:37:41.682 --> 00:37:48.190]  The DEA's response, people were thinking, would allow it to be put into a less restrictive schedule.
[00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:51.954]  It would allow more research under continued regulation.
[00:37:52.435 --> 00:37:54.618]  They also had the choice to de-schedule.
[00:37:54.938 --> 00:37:55.679]  Thank you so much.
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:20.465]  Rescheduling it to Schedule 2 could have actually made it so that it had to be prescribed by an actual physician under, you know, federal DEA laws.
[00:38:21.225 --> 00:38:31.370]  At the same time that we were awaiting that decision from the DEA, we saw that the Obama administration had another member who was actually experimenting with cannabis.
[00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:37.513]  The headline here says Malia Obama appears to be smoking pot at Lollapalooza.
[00:38:37.933 --> 00:38:41.135]  So Malia Obama was caught with cannabis.
[00:38:41.495 --> 00:38:47.678]  She was puffing away, it says, at a cigarette according to a bystander who says it was cannabis.
[00:38:48.499 --> 00:39:03.618]  She went ahead and skipped the DNC to go to Lollapalooza and even though it was decriminalized cannabis in the state of Illinois, you know, it's pretty, it's very, I would call it irresponsible for the
[00:39:04.559 --> 00:39:10.761]  President's daughter to be there, you know, smoking and, you know, in public and basically in a legal fashion.
[00:39:11.281 --> 00:39:23.184]  But I guess it's like father like daughter, because we know that when Obama was in, President Obama was in college, he claimed that he did many drugs besides cannabis.
[00:39:23.204 --> 00:39:24.384]  He also used cocaine.
[00:39:24.905 --> 00:39:29.726]  So I'm wondering why Obama now, today, with this headline,
[00:39:30.906 --> 00:39:41.793]  I'm wondering why Obama is punishing America for what his daughter made as a mistake.
[00:39:42.373 --> 00:39:49.257]  Why is Obama saying, we're going to punish everyone and make sure that we don't reclassify marijuana
[00:39:49.997 --> 00:39:58.381]  As a, you know, Schedule 1 drug, we're going to leave it being at the highest level of danger, you know, to the general public.
[00:39:58.621 --> 00:40:07.424]  We're not going to recognize all the people across the world, in Israel, in the Netherlands, and other places where they're doing extensive research on cannabis.
[00:40:07.444 --> 00:40:08.485]  We're going to ignore all that.
[00:40:08.505 --> 00:40:09.765]  We're going to keep it as Schedule 1.
[00:40:10.386 --> 00:40:18.489]  Although they do say they're going to open the door to further medical research of the drug by expanding the number of agencies that can legally grow marijuana.
[00:40:18.849 --> 00:40:26.715]  Because currently, right now, the University of Missouri is the only school that the government allows to grow cannabis.
[00:40:27.195 --> 00:40:34.741]  So, segwaying into that, we have a whole issue right here in Austin with Agenda 21.
[00:40:34.921 --> 00:40:46.350]  And this is kind of, you know, related to this because it's all about how, like I said in the start of this, how there's a different set of rules for the elite versus the average person.
[00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:50.253]  So they want to ban smoking in patios here in Austin.
[00:40:50.793 --> 00:40:55.677]  The article is from the Austin Chronicle, playback the return of the Austin smoking ban.
[00:40:56.037 --> 00:41:01.902]  A decade after the initial smoking ban, local health group, quote health group, hopes to stomp out
[00:41:02.202 --> 00:41:13.526]  Smoking Patios, a public health organization, is working to amend Austin's smoking ordinance to restrict vaping anywhere smoking is forbidden and prohibit cigarette smoking on patios of restaurants and bars.
[00:41:13.946 --> 00:41:19.568]  The initiative comes courtesy of Central Health, a taxpayer-financed hospital district in Travis County.
[00:41:20.268 --> 00:41:23.609]  The owner of Hotel Vegas says it will put us out of business.
[00:41:23.629 --> 00:41:24.609]  That's a local bar here.
[00:41:25.009 --> 00:41:28.050]  People come out to drink and they like to smoke when they drink.
[00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:28.871]  That's nightlife.
[00:41:29.231 --> 00:41:33.912]  If we can't let people smoke on our patio, the kids will start doing house shows instead of playing here.
[00:41:34.312 --> 00:41:48.997]  So some of the lists of the venues here that would be impacted include the Saxon Pub, the White Horse, Mohawk, Empire, Barracuda, Sahara Lounge, and Flamingo Cantina.
[00:41:50.197 --> 00:41:54.222]  Spider House Ballroom, Strange Brew, the list goes on and on.
[00:41:54.622 --> 00:42:04.053]  So they're willing to shut down these businesses basically based on, just like they did with Uber and Lyft, which I'm going to show you a video on that.
[00:42:05.354 --> 00:42:13.238]  But they're basically ready to shut down all these different businesses just because they think, well, maybe it's not healthy.
[00:42:13.378 --> 00:42:14.718]  Oh, this is a public health issue.
[00:42:15.018 --> 00:42:16.779]  But really, it's not a public health issue.
[00:42:16.819 --> 00:42:17.980]  It's an issue of control.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:26.584]  They're saying, Central Health is saying that the amendment isn't about deterring people from smoking, but about protecting the public from secondhand smoke.
[00:42:26.844 --> 00:42:31.386]  Let's take a look at the KView video to see what local people in Austin have been saying about this.
[00:42:32.401 --> 00:42:48.293]  City of Austin Medical Director Phillip Huang says he's for Central Health's proposal because it will improve public health, citing that tobacco is the number one cause of preventable death in Travis County and that there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke.
[00:42:48.473 --> 00:42:56.339]  Tobacco kills more than AIDS, crack, heroin, cocaine, alcohol, car accidents, fire, murder and suicide combined, and it's entirely preventable.
[00:42:56.519 --> 00:43:03.144]  City data shows only 10% of Austinites smoke, so he thinks the majority of the city will support this ban.
[00:43:03.704 --> 00:43:09.688]  So this local health expert on the city council is talking about how this is a public health issue.
[00:43:09.728 --> 00:43:12.110]  And like I said, I don't believe it's an issue of health.
[00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:13.631]  It's an issue of control.
[00:43:13.751 --> 00:43:23.658]  And the city of Austin, it's a predatory city council where they are actually trying to just take away a lot of the freedoms that people have.
[00:43:24.359 --> 00:43:30.383]  For example, it reminds me of when I lived in New York because they wanted to get rid of smoking in cars.
[00:43:30.843 --> 00:43:36.589]  And now, and also actually drinking soda too, they wanted to ban large amounts of soda.
[00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:45.798]  So now they've actually accelerated to not only wanting to ban you smoking in a car, now they want to ban smoking and cars in general.
[00:43:46.358 --> 00:43:51.859]  So, we call this, or Alex Jones actually called this, the Smart City Screwjob.
[00:43:52.239 --> 00:43:56.840]  Because here in Austin, we have a situation where Uber and Lyft have been taken out of the city.
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:05.522]  So, bad planning with these smart cities and Agenda 21 has basically got us to a point where we have no parking.
[00:44:05.862 --> 00:44:10.423]  You know, we've been able to cancel out, you know,
[00:44:10.783 --> 00:44:25.156]  They're planning to try to make us live in these smart areas by creating this technology, Uber and Lyft, and now they've basically chosen the winners and losers here because they say Uber and Lyft wouldn't comply with the laws.
[00:44:25.557 --> 00:44:28.159]  But really, I think it's a ploy to get more DWIs.
[00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:30.221]  It's $10,000 every time someone gets pulled over.
[00:44:33.704 --> 00:44:41.350]  We know that those charges had dropped significantly since Uber and Lyft were in town and now they're back up since they're gone.
[00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:47.174]  So it's all about profits and also just increasing globalism and totalitarianism.
[00:44:47.494 --> 00:44:52.578]  So let's go to a clip of Joe Biggs, Leanne McAdoo and Alex Jones discussing this issue.
[00:44:54.033 --> 00:44:54.994]  Joe, you've gone over this.
[00:44:55.294 --> 00:44:58.056]  So now it's just going to be outlawed when or it's just not going to be here?
[00:44:58.496 --> 00:44:59.297]  As of 5 a.m.
[00:44:59.317 --> 00:45:01.178]  this morning, Uber and Lyft are gone.
[00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:02.519]  You can no longer access it.
[00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:06.542]  Apparently, they're trying to negotiate with the city to see what they can figure out.
[00:45:06.882 --> 00:45:08.343]  But at the end of the day, it's all about revenue.
[00:45:08.503 --> 00:45:09.624]  Austin wants their money.
[00:45:09.664 --> 00:45:10.705]  They want to make money off of this.
[00:45:10.725 --> 00:45:14.528]  They're not getting the revenue that they got from DWIs as much as they were getting.
[00:45:14.548 --> 00:45:16.109]  They want the drunk drivers out there.
[00:45:16.169 --> 00:45:20.532]  Yeah, I mean, when they put out these ads, like, we want to stop DWIs and all this, and no they don't.
[00:45:20.552 --> 00:45:25.416]  By the way, that's why they admit that they don't ever even or hardly arrest illegals for drunk driving, because the illegals just walk.
[00:45:25.656 --> 00:45:25.916]  Right.
[00:45:26.437 --> 00:45:32.822]  When they're the ones that have completely gotten rid of all the parking downtown, you can't even find a parking spot, it was their city design.
[00:45:32.842 --> 00:45:34.643]  Yeah, this is the smart city screw job.
[00:45:34.943 --> 00:45:40.547]  And then they're like, well wait, something... It's meant to make you take buses, we innovate around it with technology, so they want to screw that over.
[00:45:41.568 --> 00:45:42.349]  So there you have it.
[00:45:42.389 --> 00:45:45.852]  The bottom line here is an overreaching local government.
[00:45:46.493 --> 00:45:51.517]  And when we go back to KVUE here in Austin, they did a poll on Twitter.
[00:45:52.238 --> 00:45:53.199]  409 people voted.
[00:45:53.219 --> 00:45:56.161]  68% said yes, ban smoking on patios.
[00:45:57.602 --> 00:46:02.005]  32% said no and that's out of a city that they claim is only 10% smokers.
[00:46:02.405 --> 00:46:14.953]  But the bottom line is it's going to shut down a lot of local businesses and change the local character of Austin if this smoking ban passes and they need to do a referendum rather than taking total control and telling us what to do.
[00:46:15.233 --> 00:46:17.814]  But this is a part of the whole Agenda 21 plan.
[00:46:18.134 --> 00:46:22.217]  They have right here this article from Kit Daniels on Infowars.com
[00:46:22.657 --> 00:46:27.841]  Agenda 21 developers plan car-free 30-story condo in Austin.
[00:46:28.181 --> 00:46:31.544]  So they want you to not be able to drive a car whatsoever.
[00:46:31.604 --> 00:46:36.388]  They're forcing you into biking, walking, ride-sharing, and public transportation.
[00:46:37.088 --> 00:46:38.910]  This is part of a UN plan.
[00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:49.058]  And so if you go on Infowars.com and you check out that article, you'll see exactly how it was developed by Hillary Clinton's husband and how they're going to continue to do this in the future.
[00:46:49.338 --> 00:46:52.927]  Stay tuned to InfoWars.com for more special reports.

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.244 --> 00:48:52.725]  I don't know.
[00:49:04.395 --> 00:49:04.935]  Welcome back.
[00:49:05.135 --> 00:49:11.679]  Joining me now in studio with an update on those reports that ISIS is operating in Mexico, Joe Biggs.
[00:49:12.039 --> 00:49:18.103]  Let's talk about the fact that we had an ISIS operative that was reportedly training militants near the U.S.
[00:49:18.183 --> 00:49:19.483]  border for the past year.
[00:49:19.543 --> 00:49:22.145]  He actually bragged about it in an Italian newspaper.
[00:49:22.825 --> 00:49:24.406]  But what's the new update?
[00:49:25.307 --> 00:49:29.309]  Yeah, I actually went down there with Josh Owens and we actually did some reporting.
[00:49:29.329 --> 00:49:30.449]  I actually took a
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:33.541]  A vehicle that I got from a guy.
[00:49:33.601 --> 00:49:40.285]  I had this local and he actually drove me into Juarez, Mexico over the border and into a town called Anopera.
[00:49:40.685 --> 00:49:48.189]  And if you go back and look at these judicial watch reports and things like that and the FBI has confirmed as well that they're a credible source on this intel.
[00:49:48.809 --> 00:49:53.873]  That ISIS has a base in the Annapurna area and they are operating their training right now.
[00:49:54.253 --> 00:50:04.820]  Now, what happened earlier this year, a top-ranking Homeland Security official acknowledged that Mexican drug cartels were helping ISIS sneak across the southern border to scope out targets for terrorist attacks.
[00:50:05.401 --> 00:50:11.065]  ISIS operative Shaikh Mohammed Omar Kabir was reportedly then training militants near the U.S.
[00:50:11.165 --> 00:50:14.727]  border in Annapurna, which is right outside of Juarez.
[00:50:15.008 --> 00:50:17.870]  Kabir actually brags in an Italian newspaper that we talked about earlier.
[00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:21.592]  He said he was wanting to kill thousands of people in Texas and Arizona.
[00:50:22.412 --> 00:50:31.037]  An ISIS operative arrested and criminally charged in Ohio this month has confirmed the terrorist group has cells in Mexico according to federal authorities.
[00:50:31.903 --> 00:50:32.243]  I think so.
[00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:54.031]  I don't know.
[00:51:09.028 --> 00:51:09.948]  They're looking into it.
[00:51:09.968 --> 00:51:10.789]  They just can't go over there.
[00:51:10.809 --> 00:51:12.849]  They don't have the, it's all that red tape stuff.
[00:51:12.869 --> 00:51:14.210]  But there's definitely a credible threat.
[00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:18.851]  If the FBI didn't think there was something going on, they wouldn't have stopped me to ask me what it is that I saw.
[00:51:19.291 --> 00:51:29.254]  So there's definitely something that's, you know, happening down there south of the border, which is why we need Donald Trump and others to come forward, secure the border so we can get this taken care of.
[00:51:29.474 --> 00:51:32.436]  Right, and there's another story coming out of Texas.
[00:51:33.277 --> 00:51:37.780]  Two wealthy Sharia Muslims actually kept slaves in their home here in Texas.
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:38.600]  That's super trendy.
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:50.528]  A judge told them that, you know, this was crazy and has actually banished them from the United States, found them guilty of engaging in forced labor of their two servants.
[00:51:50.848 --> 00:51:53.070]  The judge totally disgusted with them.
[00:51:53.350 --> 00:51:55.391]  Well, then they replied that the judge
[00:51:56.452 --> 00:51:59.394]  That they're being Islamophobic because Mohammed had slaves.
[00:51:59.735 --> 00:52:02.577]  So you can't punish them for having slaves because that's Islamophobic.
[00:52:02.597 --> 00:52:04.518]  That's their actual... Yeah.
[00:52:04.658 --> 00:52:06.800]  That's their actual argument in court.
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:07.160]  Well look...
[00:52:08.041 --> 00:52:08.781]  You're being Islamophobic!
[00:52:08.801 --> 00:52:13.123]  The Qur'an said that Muhammad had slaves so we can have slaves.
[00:52:13.183 --> 00:52:13.323]  Right.
[00:52:13.503 --> 00:52:15.143]  You're going against my religion, buddy.
[00:52:15.443 --> 00:52:16.924]  Freedom of religion, I was told, right?
[00:52:16.944 --> 00:52:17.424]  In America?
[00:52:17.684 --> 00:52:17.944]  Exactly.
[00:52:17.964 --> 00:52:19.224]  Where's the Constitution at, huh?
[00:52:19.244 --> 00:52:24.586]  Freedom of religion, as long as everyone understands that we obey the Constitution here in this country.
[00:52:24.946 --> 00:52:30.528]  And in fact, a Dallas mayor last year was raked over the coals for
[00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:48.356]  Explicitly setting this law in place that we follow the Constitution here, Sharia law, there's no Sharia courts allowed here, and everyone was laughing at her saying, oh please, that would never happen here, that could... I wonder how many Black Lives Matter protesters are going to go out and protest for this couple right here that had slaves.
[00:52:48.456 --> 00:52:54.860]  Yeah, well and of course, they were able to do this because they lied on their applications of why they were wanting to bring these people in.
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:57.982]  They lied and they said that they would be paying them $1,500 a month.
[00:52:58.343 --> 00:53:05.367]  And of course, this is the exact same program that Obama assures us will not be used to get terrorists in.
[00:53:05.448 --> 00:53:07.529]  No one's going to lie to bring people in.
[00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:10.751]  And you see here, they were willing to lie to bring in slave labor.
[00:53:10.771 --> 00:53:12.933]  So just like the con, the con job guy?
[00:53:13.193 --> 00:53:13.353]  Yeah.
[00:53:13.673 --> 00:53:19.315]  His job was to bring in those people from war-torn, Islamic, radical areas.
[00:53:19.435 --> 00:53:19.675]  Right.
[00:53:20.095 --> 00:53:22.756]  And just to show you... But that's just racist to say.
[00:53:23.156 --> 00:53:34.780]  We're all witnessing Europe just kind of in its death spiral and Germany of course with Angela Merkel wanting to make amends for the Nazi Germany of the 20th century.
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:39.001]  Now here in the 21st century she's saying well we're loving and kind now just bring everybody in.
[00:53:39.121 --> 00:53:41.462]  Meanwhile, half of those people are leaving and fleeing to Russia.
[00:53:41.482 --> 00:53:53.004]  Well, now they have a lot of Christians there fleeing, but what we're actually seeing, these Sharia courts popping up as well as a Sharia police patrol is now forming there in Hamburg.
[00:53:53.044 --> 00:54:05.347]  So these, they've got their bright jackets on, their Islamic State and Sharia police stickers on their vehicles, and so they're going around policing residents and some of the people here who aren't
[00:54:06.207 --> 00:54:06.847]  I don't think so.
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:33.984]  And we have a government like Hillary Clinton allowing people to stand behind her to support that kind of action.
[00:54:34.605 --> 00:54:47.756]  And we also have her at the DNC allowing Khan to come up here, the Khan job, and talk about how he wants to usher in radical Islamic terrorists, you know, and freaking Sadiq Mateen wants to talk about killing all these people.
[00:54:48.256 --> 00:54:51.499]  So I mean, no wonder these people, no wonder this is going to happen in Europe.
[00:54:51.519 --> 00:54:56.303]  It's going to happen here because our government's not going to punish them, they're not going to do anything, they're not going to hold anybody accountable.
[00:54:57.304 --> 00:55:05.847]  So that's why you need the Second Amendment to protect yourself against these crazy lunatics who are bloodthirsty psychopaths that want to come here and try to enforce a Sharia law BS.
[00:55:06.207 --> 00:55:07.148]  Not going to happen here, buddy.
[00:55:07.328 --> 00:55:07.548]  Right.
[00:55:07.628 --> 00:55:14.171]  Well, Hillary Clinton has assured us that she is not trying to take away our guns, but she's just trying to take away all our guns.
[00:55:14.191 --> 00:55:19.072]  She doesn't have to take our guns away if she allows a whole bunch of psychos with- Caught on tape, actually admitting that that's her plan.
[00:55:19.092 --> 00:55:22.894]  If she has a whole bunch of psychos with bombs strapped to their chest, I mean, a gun's not going to stop you there.
[00:55:23.339 --> 00:55:38.495]  Well, and also, too, they're assuring us, as we are bringing in a lot of these refugees, that everything's going to be fine and that even though they can't properly vet them, they don't know where they're coming from, most of them are young men, not women and children, as we were previously told.
[00:55:39.155 --> 00:55:43.960]  But now, indeed, we've been saying this for years now, of course, the conspiracy theorists at InfoWars,
[00:55:44.861 --> 00:55:50.728]  But they are saying secret ISIS hit squads are hiding among migrants and they're pretending to be refugees.
[00:55:50.748 --> 00:55:53.011]  This is coming right now out of German intelligence.
[00:55:53.411 --> 00:55:58.137]  These are hit squads and sleeper cells intent on waging war in Europe.
[00:55:58.337 --> 00:56:02.763]  If you want to find where the largest amount of sleeper cells are, go to Molenbeek, Belgium.
[00:56:03.837 --> 00:56:04.077]  Right.
[00:56:04.378 --> 00:56:15.594]  There are people there that are actually saying, you know, when they went to visit, I know it was the head of, of course it's not here right now, but he said he actually took the wrong turn down a street and he feared for his life.
[00:56:15.915 --> 00:56:19.840]  And this is a government official who just said, I took the wrong turn in Belgium.
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:20.101]  I mean,
[00:56:20.461 --> 00:56:25.463]  Me, Paul Joseph Watson, Michael Zimmerman went to Molenbeek, Belgium, and that is a ISIS stronghold.
[00:56:25.503 --> 00:56:27.024]  It was very intense being there.
[00:56:27.384 --> 00:56:30.265]  You could feel it, like the fact that, hey man, we don't want you here.
[00:56:30.285 --> 00:56:30.645]  Right.
[00:56:30.685 --> 00:56:31.586]  You don't belong here.
[00:56:31.606 --> 00:56:39.069]  And these guys are just sitting inside their rooms, plotting, secretly waiting to carry out another attack and bomb a whole bunch of babies and take down an airplane.
[00:56:39.129 --> 00:56:39.689]  They're crazy.
[00:56:39.969 --> 00:56:40.209]  Right.
[00:56:40.269 --> 00:56:41.210]  We've got to stop them.
[00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:42.431]  And they're sleeper cells.
[00:56:42.451 --> 00:56:43.132]  We've said it before.
[00:56:43.352 --> 00:56:44.813]  Look what happened in Paris with the attacks.
[00:56:45.133 --> 00:56:52.399]  These guys took advantage of the refugees crisis, came over into the border, into Paris, and carried out these attacks.
[00:56:52.739 --> 00:56:56.162]  Then went back over to their little ISIS stronghold and just hid around.
[00:56:57.166 --> 00:57:14.271]  And also too, it's like the political correctness brainwashing that we're seeing because also too, when we have, in France, we see people leaving, going to fight ISIS in Syria and other places, there's no law that says you can't leave the country and go fight in a war.
[00:57:14.391 --> 00:57:17.532]  But that's the problem, is that then they come back and they're radicalized.
[00:57:18.053 --> 00:57:24.415]  A perfect example of this brainwashing is a story, the way the BBC kind of talked about it.
[00:57:25.715 --> 00:57:34.364]  Last year, it was reported about these young schoolgirls, these jihadi brides, who left London in February of 2015 to join the Islamic State.
[00:57:34.705 --> 00:57:38.248]  Well, they were reporting that one of the girls has now died in the war zone.
[00:57:38.729 --> 00:57:42.973]  Well, the way the BBC put it, if you scroll down, you can see the BBC headline.
[00:57:43.954 --> 00:57:47.238]  It says, London schoolgirl reportedly
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:51.081]  Keep scrolling and you'll see the BBC headline.
[00:57:51.981 --> 00:57:54.622]  London schoolgirl feared dead in Syria.
[00:57:55.502 --> 00:57:58.203]  No, but she left to join ISIS.
[00:57:58.243 --> 00:58:00.244]  You're forgetting like a key part of that.
[00:58:00.284 --> 00:58:01.664]  It's not a London schoolgirl.
[00:58:01.684 --> 00:58:02.504]  That's what you have to understand.
[00:58:02.584 --> 00:58:04.805]  She left to go join ISIS.
[00:58:05.225 --> 00:58:25.122]  Paul Joseph Watts and many others have done reports on how a bulk of these refugees from these war-stricken countries that are predominantly run by Sharia law, that live in London, Paris, all these places now, support Sharia law, support killing people, support ISIS, support beheading people, support strapping a bomb to the chest and blowing you up.
[00:58:25.623 --> 00:58:28.125]  And it's going to happen here if we don't wake up.
[00:58:28.533 --> 00:58:28.753]  Right.
[00:58:28.853 --> 00:58:43.020]  Well, there's already reports coming out of California with some church leaders there saying that they stepped outside and there was a group of kids in a car shouting Allah Akbar through a megaphone disrupting their church service there.
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:50.603]  So, I mean, we've already seen what's with the priest in France there with getting his head practically decapitated when they slit his throat.
[00:58:50.643 --> 00:58:56.186]  So, I mean, we do need to be vigilant and, you know, not allow our political correctness to harm us here.
[00:58:56.846 --> 00:58:59.788]  Joe Biggs, thank you very much, and thank you all for tuning in tonight.
[00:58:59.848 --> 00:59:01.910]  We'll see you here again next week, 7 p.m.
[00:59:01.930 --> 00:59:02.290]  Central.
[00:59:04.132 --> 00:59:09.937]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.397 --> 00:59:20.105]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:24.166]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.726 --> 00:59:29.387]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.787 --> 00:59:36.008]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
