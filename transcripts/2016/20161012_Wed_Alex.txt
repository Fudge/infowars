[00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:16.294]  Wednesday, October 12, 2016.
[00:00:16.714 --> 00:00:18.916]  Danny Williams is in the green room.
[00:00:19.416 --> 00:00:20.276]  He's going to be live.
[00:00:20.696 --> 00:00:22.057]  The reported son of Bill Clinton.
[00:00:22.177 --> 00:00:24.218]  I believe he is the son of Bill Clinton.
[00:00:24.238 --> 00:00:25.519]  But first, a key report.
[00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:26.019]  Stay with us.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.240]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.740]  With the gold.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.422]  I've got to use some kickbacks just in case I start kissing her.
[00:00:32.463 --> 00:00:34.444]  You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful women.
[00:00:34.464 --> 00:00:35.524]  I just start kissing them.
[00:00:35.624 --> 00:00:36.425]  It's like a magnet.
[00:00:38.946 --> 00:00:40.387]  And when you're a star, they let you do it.
[00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:41.607]  You can do anything.
[00:00:41.647 --> 00:00:42.147]  Whatever you want.
[00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:45.701]  I can do anything.
[00:00:46.422 --> 00:01:05.650]  This latest controversy marks a divide when those who are aware of the CIA-controlled media protecting the interests of the multinational corporate elite's pawn Hillary Clinton react in disgust, and the disgust from those who still think that reality is as it seems.
[00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.413]  Are we gonna hold that to Hillary Clinton, to the things when she apologized?
[00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:10.013]  Oh, wait a minute.
[00:01:10.354 --> 00:01:13.816]  She never really apologized for insulting this horrible guy.
[00:01:14.117 --> 00:01:19.381]  What did you do the day you saw the tape of this man boasting about grabbing a woman's d**k?
[00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:20.242]  Period.
[00:01:20.262 --> 00:01:21.683]  Will you please stop saying that word?
[00:01:21.723 --> 00:01:22.924]  My daughter is listening.
[00:01:23.204 --> 00:01:24.966]  You know what, Sotty?
[00:01:25.106 --> 00:01:30.890]  Don't tell me you're offended when I say d**k, but you're not offended when Donald Trump says it.
[00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.231]  I'm not running for president.
[00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:32.752]  He is.
[00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:40.561]  If only they could just open their eyes for a moment, they would actually see that totalitarianism is warping that accepted reality.
[00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:47.929]  George Orwell described totalitarianism as such, a society living by and for continuous warfare
[00:01:48.269 --> 00:02:09.752]  Hillary Clinton is just the latest villain from a long line of mind-controlling ne'er-do-wells that have ruled over the United States since it was inevitably infiltrated by the global elite's central bank scam in 1913.
[00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:15.017]  Systematically kept in line by methods of manufactured terror.
[00:02:15.417 --> 00:02:17.079]  Building 7 I often hear about.
[00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.280]  No plane hit building 7.
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.921]  Why did building 7 come down?
[00:02:20.742 --> 00:02:21.523]  What do you tell people?
[00:02:21.723 --> 00:02:22.384]  What is building 7?
[00:02:23.104 --> 00:02:23.385]  Building 7.
[00:02:24.205 --> 00:02:25.086]  I have no idea.
[00:02:25.106 --> 00:02:25.827]  I've never heard that.
[00:02:27.725 --> 00:02:29.287]  More money for the Pentagon when its own auditors
[00:02:43.524 --> 00:02:44.024]  We know it's gone.
[00:03:12.202 --> 00:03:13.422]  We don't know what they're spending on.
[00:03:13.522 --> 00:03:16.263]  What Trump said amounts to nothing.
[00:03:16.523 --> 00:03:24.986]  Nothing compared to her husband's rape victims, some of them brutally raped, only to be attacked publicly by Hillary after the deed was done.
[00:03:25.626 --> 00:03:40.071]  She grabbed ahold of my arm and my hand and she pulls me into her and she says with this very angry look on her face, which had been so pleasant seconds before, and in a low voice says,
[00:03:40.791 --> 00:03:43.712]  Do you understand everything you do?
[00:03:44.452 --> 00:03:45.353]  And that frightened me.
[00:03:45.933 --> 00:03:46.913]  I felt like she knew.
[00:03:46.933 --> 00:03:48.434]  That he raped you?
[00:03:48.634 --> 00:03:51.475]  Yes, and that she was telling me to keep quiet.
[00:03:51.735 --> 00:04:00.399]  Nothing compared to the savagery Middle Eastern women endure and Hillary ignores, only to push the divide and conquer refugee invasion narrative.
[00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:05.981]  A fiction that will eventually lead to the rape of thousands of unsuspecting American women and children.
[00:04:06.241 --> 00:04:10.242]  Nothing compared to the bodies hidden along Hillary's path to power.
[00:04:10.522 --> 00:04:19.865]  Nothing compared to the thousands that have died in the name of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's rape of Northern Africa due to the conquest of rich men's wars.
[00:04:20.165 --> 00:04:28.947]  Perpetual wars fought in the perceived name of freedom and democracy, only benefiting the wealthy that become wealthier by playing both sides.
[00:04:29.307 --> 00:04:32.888]  Maiming and killing our brave fighting men and women in the process.
[00:04:33.388 --> 00:04:37.552]  In fact, what Trump said should actually strengthen your resolve.
[00:04:37.752 --> 00:04:42.356]  You see, 11 years ago when Trump said this, he wasn't a politician.
[00:04:42.596 --> 00:04:48.661]  He wasn't being groomed and compromised like CIA plant Hillary has been her entire political life.
[00:04:48.842 --> 00:04:53.065]  He was just a guy, like so many other guys, just making a joke.
[00:04:53.346 --> 00:04:58.270]  If you want to see a sexual predator, take the blinders off and look no further.
[00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.593]  Then Hillary's right-hand man, and I'm not referring to the genderless Illuminati sellout Tim Kaine.
[00:05:04.873 --> 00:05:06.934]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com.
[00:05:07.534 --> 00:05:09.295]  We'll be back with Danny Williams and more.
[00:05:10.375 --> 00:05:15.258]  Russia has ordered all of its officials to fly home, including any relatives living abroad.
[00:05:15.278 --> 00:05:19.499]  This news comes as tension mounts over the prospect of pending global war.
[00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:24.702]  A failure to heed the instruction could put promotion chances at risk, according to local reports from Moscow.
[00:05:25.162 --> 00:05:27.943]  This news comes amid worsening relations between Russia and the U.S.
[00:05:28.043 --> 00:05:28.764]  over Syria.
[00:05:28.924 --> 00:05:34.106]  Politicians and high-ranking figures are said to have received a direct warning from Russian President Vladimir Putin.
[00:05:34.226 --> 00:05:40.069]  This news comes as Putin has cancelled a planned visit to France amid conflict over Moscow's role in the Syrian theater.
[00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:46.012]  Just days after this news emerged, the Kremlin has moved nuclear-capable missiles near the Polish border.
[00:05:46.212 --> 00:05:53.196]  Russian political analyst Stanislav Bilkowski said this is all part of a package of measures to prepare elites to some big war.
[00:05:53.516 --> 00:05:55.417]  Relations between Russia and the U.S.
[00:05:55.557 --> 00:05:59.198]  are at their lowest since the Cold War and continue to deteriorate.
[00:05:59.418 --> 00:06:06.640]  Even former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has warned the world is in a dangerous point due to rising tensions between Russia and the U.S.
[00:06:06.881 --> 00:06:09.661]  I'm Margaret Hale reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:06:10.562 --> 00:06:12.342]  I'm going to lay it out short and sweet.
[00:06:14.043 --> 00:06:19.725]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[00:06:20.405 --> 00:06:22.546]  I was a total fitness nut.
[00:06:23.874 --> 00:06:24.323]  20 years ago.
[00:06:25.306 --> 00:06:27.487]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[00:06:27.567 --> 00:06:28.748]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:31.969]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:33.289]  Or more.
[00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:35.310]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.791]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[00:06:38.492 --> 00:06:40.732]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[00:06:40.812 --> 00:06:42.633]  It's actually scary.
[00:06:43.474 --> 00:06:53.518]  And it's because I take products that are researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[00:06:54.554 --> 00:07:07.343]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.
[00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:19.176]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:07:19.256 --> 00:07:27.363]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:07:27.643 --> 00:07:32.345]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:07:32.526 --> 00:07:39.229]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:46.392]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:07:46.473 --> 00:07:53.356]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:07:53.516 --> 00:07:57.858]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:07:57.998 --> 00:08:01.260]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:07.504]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:08:07.684 --> 00:08:09.365]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:21.423]  I mean, she is an abject, psychopathic demon from hell that as soon as she gets into power is going to try to destroy the planet.
[00:08:21.863 --> 00:08:25.165]  She's worked like a demon, as you know, with Secretary of State.
[00:08:25.385 --> 00:08:27.967]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:08:30.208 --> 00:08:32.709]  What difference, at this point, does it make?
[00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:43.836]  And there's only one candidate in this race who understands that democracy in a big, diverse country doesn't work if you constantly demonize each other, demonize each other.
[00:08:44.571 --> 00:08:49.412]  You could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.
[00:08:49.952 --> 00:08:51.493]  And I mean that literally, by the way.
[00:08:51.593 --> 00:08:53.673]  I was reading the other day.
[00:08:53.713 --> 00:08:58.615]  There's a guy on the radio who apparently trumps on his show frequently.
[00:08:58.675 --> 00:09:00.435]  He says me and Hillary are demons.
[00:09:01.015 --> 00:09:01.776]  I'm telling you.
[00:09:04.556 --> 00:09:05.497]  She is a demon.
[00:09:07.877 --> 00:09:08.757]  This is biblical.
[00:09:08.857 --> 00:09:10.758]  She's going to launch a nuclear war.
[00:09:12.612 --> 00:09:14.274]  Said we, smell like sulfur.
[00:09:14.595 --> 00:09:26.008]  Ain't that something?
[00:09:26.128 --> 00:09:31.134]  Now... I mean... Come on, people!
[00:09:33.433 --> 00:09:35.014]  You can't watch that evil off, Ken.
[00:09:35.434 --> 00:09:41.216]  I'm not kidding, people say... Folks, I've been told this by Hyatt folks.
[00:09:41.256 --> 00:09:44.538]  They say, listen, Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[00:09:45.338 --> 00:09:49.239]  I never said this because the media go crazy with it, but I've talked to people that are in protective details.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.400]  I mean, they're scared of it.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.722]  And they say, listen, she's a freaking demon and she stinks and so is Obama.
[00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:56.362]  And I go like, what?
[00:09:56.562 --> 00:09:56.903]  Sulfur.
[00:09:58.223 --> 00:09:59.804]  They smell like hell.
[00:10:01.227 --> 00:10:04.629]  On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C.
[00:10:04.669 --> 00:10:09.691]  will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.
[00:10:09.711 --> 00:10:10.932]  It's about time.
[00:10:12.132 --> 00:10:17.455]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[00:10:25.472 --> 00:10:43.084]  Max Bluch, a neocon at the Council on Foreign Relations, which admits it operates to shadow government, Hillary Clinton has said that in four different speeches and written about it in two books, wrote a big story over the weekend with the headline, the alt-right is destroying itself listening to its own media.
[00:10:44.325 --> 00:10:49.689]  And he said that we were in an echo chamber and that we were failing.
[00:10:51.311 --> 00:11:00.118]  When mainstream corporate media is a shadow of its former self, has 6% trust, according to the Associated Press' own research, of itself.
[00:11:00.138 --> 00:11:04.421]  I mean, North Korea, the people have more faith in the media.
[00:11:05.923 --> 00:11:09.105]  There it is, Republicans are paying the price for their addiction to their own media.
[00:11:09.906 --> 00:11:17.652]  And what they do is they sit there and create a perception that we're all crazy and take what we say out of context.
[00:11:19.138 --> 00:11:24.283]  But the truth is, the new media, whether it's left-wing, right-wing, libertarian, doesn't matter, is exploding.
[00:11:25.925 --> 00:11:29.749]  Mainstream media is corporately funded, but is collapsing.
[00:11:31.345 --> 00:11:38.810]  And so if you go look at the news every day, it's always Trump in trouble, Trump to drop out, Trump loses all of his support, Trump can't raise any money.
[00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:39.330]  Why?
[00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:42.132]  Out of the blue, 30-something Republicans turned against him.
[00:11:42.212 --> 00:11:49.296]  They were all the same Republicans that said that if you voted for him, the nomination didn't count and that your popular vote didn't count.
[00:11:50.017 --> 00:11:51.938]  So they were just waiting within minutes.
[00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:53.299]  And Jerry Falwell Jr.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.621]  actually got calls and met with the top Republicans that warned him
[00:11:58.783 --> 00:12:03.287]  Seven weeks ago this was coming and he told Trump, well, I mean, of course it's coming!
[00:12:04.187 --> 00:12:09.892]  They even said, oh, there'll be, you know, three months, four months after the nomination for us to still get Trump.
[00:12:12.094 --> 00:12:12.754]  And that's what they did.
[00:12:14.476 --> 00:12:19.520]  And then boom, they take this tape, I mean, which is nothing compared to John McCain or Obama or Bill Clinton and their talk.
[00:12:20.805 --> 00:12:26.830]  They edit it, they take it out of context, and then it's the end of the world!
[00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:28.972]  Trump's resigning, it's over!
[00:12:29.152 --> 00:12:32.054]  We heard that three times the last few months for other scandals.
[00:12:32.615 --> 00:12:35.237]  Meanwhile, Hillary represents convicted
[00:12:36.479 --> 00:12:40.480]  Criminals across the board, who then get indicted again for things like child molestation.
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.341]  Hillary Clinton makes jokes about it on tape, knowing that they were innocent.
[00:12:44.081 --> 00:12:45.221]  Hillary represents jihadis.
[00:12:45.441 --> 00:12:46.622]  Hillary represents foreign governments.
[00:12:46.902 --> 00:12:48.502]  She's everything she says Trump is.
[00:12:48.522 --> 00:12:50.023]  She says Trump won't work for U.S.
[00:12:50.043 --> 00:12:52.883]  interests, he'll work for his own, when she's the one working against U.S.
[00:12:52.923 --> 00:12:53.223]  interests.
[00:12:54.984 --> 00:13:01.125]  And so then, I baited the media a few days ago, I don't even say it on the tape I am, that Hillary and Obama are literal demons.
[00:13:01.165 --> 00:13:02.626]  Now, I was told by
[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:09.962]  Detective Details, both military and Secret Service, that I said, why do they always have flies landing on them?
[00:13:10.362 --> 00:13:11.523]  We saw it happen during the debate.
[00:13:11.763 --> 00:13:20.126]  Back in the Middle Ages, and even in ancient times before that, a fly landing on someone when it wasn't on anybody else was seen as a symbol of death or evil.
[00:13:21.206 --> 00:13:23.707]  They would paint them in Middle Age paintings.
[00:13:27.423 --> 00:13:33.709]  Dark age paintings, renaissance paintings of a fly on a skull or a fly on a person as a sign of death.
[00:13:34.409 --> 00:13:39.134]  There's paintings of Judas Iscariot that betrayed Christ, famous renaissance paintings with a fly on it.
[00:13:40.455 --> 00:13:44.939]  And so we just said, isn't it archetypal that Hillary's becoming the lord of the flies?
[00:13:45.119 --> 00:13:47.381]  As the Bible says, the devil's the lord of the flies.
[00:13:47.922 --> 00:13:51.946]  And that Obama, all over the world has flies landing on him and they're not landing on anybody else, they're landing on her.
[00:13:52.186 --> 00:13:53.067]  It's archetypal!
[00:13:54.426 --> 00:13:58.428]  It's tongue-in-cheek when I say absolute literal demon from hell.
[00:14:01.469 --> 00:14:12.515]  She's obviously not an absolute literal, her body, but I do believe in the Bible, I do believe there's evil influence, and obviously Hillary Clinton's an evil person that brags about overthrowing countries and letting jihadis in to murder hundreds of thousands of Christians.
[00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:22.939]  And her internal emails show her hatred for the public and the common people and folks that live in their parents' basements and baristas, her own supporters, and her own emails show this.
[00:14:23.099 --> 00:14:25.722]  And more are coming out of her hatred for the public.
[00:14:28.685 --> 00:14:35.912]  Remember when I came out and I said we need to know that they're going to try to federalize and take over the election because Trump is so far ahead in all the major internal polls?
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:43.222]  Obama came out two days later and said, oh, that guy in Texas, there's no such thing as election fraud.
[00:14:43.262 --> 00:14:50.605]  That's like saying there's no such thing as wildfires, or no such thing as daisies, or no such things as automobiles.
[00:14:50.665 --> 00:14:52.926]  I mean, it's just ridiculous on its face.
[00:14:53.846 --> 00:14:57.108]  And then, two weeks later, they go, emergency!
[00:14:57.328 --> 00:15:00.729]  The Russians and others are going to hack all the systems and steal it for Trump.
[00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.450]  We've got to federalize the elections.
[00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:03.271]  And what did I say at the time?
[00:15:03.491 --> 00:15:06.392]  I said, watch Homeland Security claiming they're stopping hacks.
[00:15:08.769 --> 00:15:09.609]  That will be the hack.
[00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:12.390]  And they did exactly as I said.
[00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.291]  Oh, but the mainstream media is so smart.
[00:15:15.692 --> 00:15:17.872]  They come out and go, it's all over for Trump.
[00:15:18.633 --> 00:15:20.553]  Alex Jones says we're literal demons.
[00:15:20.874 --> 00:15:21.514]  We're devils.
[00:15:23.166 --> 00:15:24.807]  Oh my gosh, isn't it kooky?
[00:15:25.327 --> 00:15:27.648]  See, they're all run by CIA people.
[00:15:27.868 --> 00:15:36.973]  And there's more anthropologists and sociologists and psychologists in the CIA than there are commandos and historians.
[00:15:37.453 --> 00:15:48.459]  And they're all obsessed with knowing the subgroup and seeing us all as, you know, pygmy villagers or something, or, you know, ancient Germanic, you know, villagers.
[00:15:49.554 --> 00:15:59.497]  They see us as animals, and they're up there calculating our culture, and calculating our background, and looking at how we operate, keeping us in the dark while they're part of the future.
[00:16:01.858 --> 00:16:03.338]  And they say that, the new WikiLeaks emails.
[00:16:03.358 --> 00:16:08.360]  It's just full of how they control us, and they have all the answers, and they know everything.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:15.622]  I covered some of those yesterday, where they said, we want to keep the public unaware and compliant.
[00:16:17.422 --> 00:16:17.803]  Remember that?
[00:16:18.203 --> 00:16:19.163]  That's the top of the campaign.
[00:16:22.443 --> 00:16:27.405]  So, the way they do it is saying, you're a loser, you failed, there's no awakening.
[00:16:29.166 --> 00:16:48.233]  You understand, until the day that the United States Army Air Corps dropped two A-bombs, Fat Man and Little Boy, on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Tokyo Rose was on a super powerful AM transmitter every hour saying, you have lost, your ships have been sunk, your fleets are defeated, it's all over, you're dead.
[00:16:50.782 --> 00:16:51.523]  And that's what this is.
[00:16:52.183 --> 00:16:54.765]  Now 20 years ago, they had the upper hand, they were beating us.
[00:16:55.206 --> 00:16:58.429]  And I was telling you, we're getting beat, we're in trouble, it's horrible, we gotta mobilize.
[00:16:59.129 --> 00:17:03.293]  I don't sit here and like try to, like Oprah Winfrey's the secret and speak things into reality.
[00:17:03.753 --> 00:17:04.894]  You have to take action to do that.
[00:17:04.914 --> 00:17:11.960]  And I said over and over again, we have to turn the tide, we have to expose globalism, the puppet masters, not the puppets.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.102]  They can always replace the puppets, but not the puppet masters.
[00:17:14.342 --> 00:17:15.583]  We've got to expose that.
[00:17:16.764 --> 00:17:17.365]  I'm gonna skip this break.
[00:17:18.584 --> 00:17:21.551]  And that's what I did over and over and over again.
[00:17:21.611 --> 00:17:25.379]  You did that, others did it, because you could see classical psychological warfare they were using.
[00:17:27.065 --> 00:17:35.447]  So, Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations, the group sworn to create world government and our sovereignty, I mean, every publication they put out every two months admits that.
[00:17:35.867 --> 00:17:43.829]  They put out stuff five years ago saying why we need Al-Qaeda in Syria, and admitted our government was financing Al-Qaeda, now known as ISIS.
[00:17:43.869 --> 00:17:46.149]  I mean, they hide this stuff in plain view.
[00:17:46.809 --> 00:17:49.630]  You can go to Barnes & Noble, every two months it comes out, Foreign Affairs.
[00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.790]  It's on a magazine, it's like a book, a little green book.
[00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:54.291]  It's about 200 pages thick.
[00:17:58.118 --> 00:18:00.279]  I sit here and read what they're saying, what they're doing.
[00:18:00.599 --> 00:18:04.420]  They think you're so unintellectual that you'll never look into it all.
[00:18:05.781 --> 00:18:07.641]  And know that I'm not telling you my opinion.
[00:18:07.701 --> 00:18:13.924]  I'm telling you word for word what they've said and what they've done and what they stand for.
[00:18:15.064 --> 00:18:17.265]  So he talks about the right wing is in an echo chamber.
[00:18:17.345 --> 00:18:19.586]  Hey brother, you're in an echo chamber and you know it.
[00:18:20.786 --> 00:18:21.566]  I'm not right wing.
[00:18:21.666 --> 00:18:22.807]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[00:18:23.247 --> 00:18:23.987]  I'm a patriot.
[00:18:24.287 --> 00:18:25.748]  I transcend your left-right system.
[00:18:26.658 --> 00:18:48.765]  Now, your modern left is a bunch of fascist, control freak, victim, useful idiot morons who I am exposing with very harsh language to try to shake them out of their mind control stupor of invincible ignorance and wearing their ignorance like it's a crown of enlightenment.
[00:18:49.906 --> 00:18:52.729]  But I'm not here trying to use their ignorance against them.
[00:18:52.849 --> 00:18:54.351]  I'm trying to empower them.
[00:18:54.551 --> 00:19:00.117]  Because when they're empowered, those of us that are already more enlightened and smarter than they are, we will rise even higher.
[00:19:01.238 --> 00:19:03.640]  You can't lower people and not lower yourself.
[00:19:03.981 --> 00:19:07.464]  That's a metaphysical rule of the universe.
[00:19:07.684 --> 00:19:08.926]  It's natural law.
[00:19:10.674 --> 00:19:11.815]  That everything's interconnected.
[00:19:12.555 --> 00:19:14.256]  And these globalists are like cancer.
[00:19:14.656 --> 00:19:19.118]  They think because they take over and dominate because they're evil, they are the enlightened ones and the dominant ones.
[00:19:19.198 --> 00:19:19.358]  No.
[00:19:19.619 --> 00:19:21.079]  You're the malfunctioning cancer.
[00:19:21.299 --> 00:19:25.402]  If I get cancer, you get cancer, and it kills us, the cancer cells die too, don't they?
[00:19:25.942 --> 00:19:26.862]  But they're not conscious.
[00:19:26.882 --> 00:19:28.543]  They just think, I do whatever I want.
[00:19:29.103 --> 00:19:30.444]  I take over whatever I want.
[00:19:31.605 --> 00:19:33.786]  That's conquest versus renaissance.
[00:19:33.806 --> 00:19:35.607]  Now I'm going to get into all the big news here, but
[00:19:37.776 --> 00:19:39.638]  There are just a wall of stories.
[00:19:39.698 --> 00:19:40.319]  Trump is over.
[00:19:40.359 --> 00:19:41.019]  Trump's a loser.
[00:19:41.059 --> 00:19:41.720]  Trump's an idiot.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.662]  You know, if you vote for Trump, you lose.
[00:19:43.722 --> 00:19:44.343]  He's gonna lose.
[00:19:44.543 --> 00:19:46.865]  He's 10 points, 20 points, 30 points, 80 points.
[00:19:46.966 --> 00:19:52.271]  I mean, I've seen articles where they're saying he's 30 points behind.
[00:19:52.331 --> 00:19:56.415]  And then you read the poll, and they're sampling 60% more Democrats than Republicans.
[00:19:56.475 --> 00:19:57.817]  I mean, it is getting crazy.
[00:19:59.619 --> 00:20:10.181]  Because again, they think they can put in the methodology of the poll the fact that it's totally fake, but you're too dumb to understand what sampling 46% Democrats and 22% Republicans means.
[00:20:11.181 --> 00:20:14.062]  Or sampling 42% Democrats and 19% Republicans.
[00:20:15.602 --> 00:20:18.063]  And then Bloomberg comes out and says, well, we're not going to do that.
[00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:19.903]  We're only going to sample 10% more.
[00:20:21.684 --> 00:20:22.484]  We're more scientific.
[00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:24.744]  Politico!
[00:20:25.305 --> 00:20:27.327]  They only sampled 7% more.
[00:20:28.027 --> 00:20:30.709]  Oh, and then Hillary was only winning by 2 points in that one.
[00:20:30.729 --> 00:20:31.730]  They had him in a dead heat.
[00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:37.115]  See, all of America should be flipping out at just the way they're running the polls.
[00:20:37.335 --> 00:20:40.117]  The way they turned his microphone off two debates ago.
[00:20:41.438 --> 00:20:46.122]  The way they interrupt him 70 times, 40 times, Hillary 6 times, 3 times.
[00:20:47.303 --> 00:20:51.987]  When you see something this rigged, and the whole corrupt establishment throwing everything it's got at the public,
[00:20:54.002 --> 00:20:55.764]  You've got to know that Donald Trump's the man.
[00:20:56.725 --> 00:20:57.586]  Doesn't mean he's perfect.
[00:20:58.047 --> 00:20:59.969]  Doesn't mean his feet won't have to be held to the fire.
[00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:06.837]  But we know the Clintons, they are the most archetypal, corrupt, out of control group that I could possibly imagine.
[00:21:06.877 --> 00:21:08.018]  Now, here's what's coming up today.
[00:21:09.179 --> 00:21:12.984]  Speaking of censorship, speaking of control, I want to show TV viewers this article right here.
[00:21:13.384 --> 00:21:14.365]  This is DrudgeReport.com.
[00:21:24.454 --> 00:21:36.678]  CNN boss Jeff Zucker has directly ordered network staff not to cover shocking allegations made by Arkansas resident Danny Williams.
[00:21:37.038 --> 00:21:38.259]  The Drudge Report has learned.
[00:21:38.819 --> 00:21:45.861]  Williams, who is set to give his first TV interview today on InfoWars.com, claims to be Bill Clinton's biological son.
[00:21:46.441 --> 00:21:51.523]  Jeff thinks it is ridiculous hoax, a top CNN source said.
[00:21:54.412 --> 00:22:00.216]  I always felt bad about Bill Clinton not wanting to be in my life, Williams explains in the video released Monday.
[00:22:01.918 --> 00:22:03.179]  Was it because I was black?
[00:22:03.619 --> 00:22:04.800]  Was there something wrong with me?
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.182]  It made me think sometimes even of suicide.
[00:22:10.904 --> 00:22:13.726]  It's not fair and it's been hurtful.
[00:22:14.747 --> 00:22:17.029]  Hillary, please do not deny I exist.
[00:22:17.629 --> 00:22:18.110]  I am your
[00:22:19.747 --> 00:22:20.247]  Stepson.
[00:22:20.267 --> 00:22:22.149]  So all of that is developing.
[00:22:22.169 --> 00:22:23.410]  But what's the bigger story here?
[00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:25.331]  He'll be in studio in about an hour with us.
[00:22:25.351 --> 00:22:26.952]  He's in the room right next to us right now.
[00:22:27.152 --> 00:22:30.154]  We're about to tweet out photos of he and I during the last break here in the studio.
[00:22:32.055 --> 00:22:37.299]  Photo of Danny standing in front of our big TV screen right here with CNN orders blackout on Clinton's son.
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:40.061]  Now there it is.
[00:22:40.561 --> 00:22:41.722]  Tweeted at real Alex Jones.
[00:22:44.383 --> 00:22:46.785]  And it's not like this guy just popped up like the media is saying.
[00:22:46.846 --> 00:22:49.808]  I was on air 21 years ago and interviewed his aunt.
[00:22:50.209 --> 00:22:51.390]  I remember interviewing her.
[00:22:52.291 --> 00:22:53.332]  Christian church lady.
[00:22:58.317 --> 00:23:01.020]  I remember having the Arkansas State Troopers on.
[00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:18.610]  I remember hearing about the money being delivered to the little shack, $700 a month, and the Christmas presents until he tried to go to the mansion in Little Rock down the street, a few miles away, and climb the fence and go to the front door and meet Bill Clinton.
[00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:21.912]  But Hillary had the state police come out and run him off.
[00:23:22.552 --> 00:23:25.974]  Or how his mother ran in with the baby years before when he was a baby.
[00:23:28.993 --> 00:23:34.437]  And Bill Clinton, you gotta hand it to him, actually had some heart and some soul and tried to take care of his son.
[00:23:34.457 --> 00:23:37.178]  If it wasn't his son, why would he do that?
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.221]  Please Hillary, do not deny I exist.
[00:23:41.361 --> 00:23:42.042]  I am your stepson.
[00:23:42.062 --> 00:23:42.662]  That is coming up.
[00:23:42.702 --> 00:23:44.043]  So how does the media respond?
[00:23:44.663 --> 00:23:48.406]  Oh, the head of CNN, Jeff Zucker, just says, I think it's
[00:23:51.072 --> 00:23:51.933]  Ridiculous hoax.
[00:23:52.553 --> 00:23:52.994]  Close quote.
[00:23:53.014 --> 00:23:55.676]  So he believes it just like they said in the last year.
[00:23:55.696 --> 00:23:56.978]  Never talk about Hillary's health.
[00:23:57.198 --> 00:23:58.779]  Don't let anybody talk about her falling down.
[00:23:58.839 --> 00:23:59.640]  Now we know she does.
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:00.821]  Now we know there's a cover-up.
[00:24:01.442 --> 00:24:07.548]  They say don't talk about all these other things because the head of CNN has told everybody you don't do it.
[00:24:07.828 --> 00:24:08.889]  Same thing with MSNBC.
[00:24:09.249 --> 00:24:12.812]  So it's our job at Infowars to break through that electronic Berlin Wall.
[00:24:13.735 --> 00:24:14.736]  And to force that discussion.
[00:24:15.116 --> 00:24:16.657]  Does Alex Jones get demonized?
[00:24:16.697 --> 00:24:17.497]  Do I get attacked?
[00:24:17.517 --> 00:24:18.938]  Do I get ridiculed by mainstream media?
[00:24:18.998 --> 00:24:19.498]  Absolutely.
[00:24:20.159 --> 00:24:21.880]  And 15 years ago, that would hurt us.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.881]  They still had maybe 40% credibility.
[00:24:25.122 --> 00:24:26.522]  They have 6% credibility.
[00:24:29.524 --> 00:24:35.588]  This is a criminal, deceptive combine that admittedly the WikiLeaks prove even more, get daily directives and talking points.
[00:24:35.608 --> 00:24:36.168]  We already know that.
[00:24:37.381 --> 00:24:46.783]  And it's the non-talking point media that's only a handful of groups that now has more viewers and listeners than all the giant spectrum of mainstream media that's falling apart.
[00:24:47.343 --> 00:24:50.904]  And their answer, as they fall apart, is to get the wagons closer together.
[00:24:53.624 --> 00:24:55.205]  To centralize the control even more.
[00:24:55.245 --> 00:24:56.805]  I have a stack of WikiLeaks after the break.
[00:24:56.825 --> 00:24:57.965]  I'm going to go over that to show that.
[00:24:58.966 --> 00:24:59.566]  The latest ones.
[00:24:59.986 --> 00:25:00.706]  Total control.
[00:25:00.966 --> 00:25:05.707]  When she's on CNN, when she's on MSNBC, there is a teleprompter behind the reporter.
[00:25:07.642 --> 00:25:09.083]  He's asking prepared questions.
[00:25:09.563 --> 00:25:11.684]  She is responding in a totally scripted event.
[00:25:11.965 --> 00:25:13.245]  We already knew that from the emails.
[00:25:13.325 --> 00:25:15.387]  Now it comes out that the whole thing's scripted.
[00:25:16.007 --> 00:25:16.667]  Word for word.
[00:25:17.748 --> 00:25:19.529]  Actors, actresses at her events.
[00:25:19.709 --> 00:25:20.570]  Fake town halls.
[00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:24.952]  When she does have real ones, people show up behind her with Bill Clinton rape shirts.
[00:25:25.933 --> 00:25:27.394]  Obama goes out in public yesterday.
[00:25:27.714 --> 00:25:32.337]  Three people, over 20 minutes, pop up and say Bill Clinton's a rapist and expose it.
[00:25:33.257 --> 00:25:34.678]  He then goes into the whole diatribe that
[00:25:37.617 --> 00:25:39.057]  Oh, this demonization campaign.
[00:25:39.457 --> 00:25:45.959]  This talk show host you wouldn't name, but everybody in the news is seeing your name, Alex Jones, says I'm literally a demon and stink.
[00:25:46.019 --> 00:25:48.939]  Well, I mean, I asked people, why are there always flies landing on you and Hillary?
[00:25:48.959 --> 00:25:50.980]  And they said, we don't know what it is, but they both smell.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.160]  And they didn't say sulfur.
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:56.141]  They actually said, like, like, S.H., you know what?
[00:25:56.161 --> 00:26:02.502]  I don't know what's going on with you people, but hey, Mao Zedong reportedly stunk so bad, even when he was young.
[00:26:03.242 --> 00:26:03.622]  Look it up!
[00:26:04.483 --> 00:26:04.803]  Linen.
[00:26:05.383 --> 00:26:06.043]  Totally stunk.
[00:26:09.326 --> 00:26:13.010]  These people just, I guess they don't care about anybody, so they don't even take baths or something, I don't know.
[00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:18.896]  The point is, is that she funds jihadis worldwide, kills hundreds of thousands of Christians, that's demonic.
[00:26:19.097 --> 00:26:23.041]  They fund abortuaries selling 8th and 9th month baby parts.
[00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:24.623]  They keep babies alive while they butcher them.
[00:26:25.203 --> 00:26:26.104]  They try to cover up that.
[00:26:26.124 --> 00:26:31.170]  Obama hates bitter clingers on the Bible and the guns.
[00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:37.393]  But the most interesting part is they say, how dare them become so mean and vitriolic.
[00:26:37.613 --> 00:26:39.355]  They say we're doing that because we're losing.
[00:26:40.116 --> 00:26:43.098]  No, we defeated you trying to block the Tea Party Liberty Movement.
[00:26:43.178 --> 00:26:44.199]  It's surging, you know it.
[00:26:44.439 --> 00:26:46.200]  You actually admit that in your internal WikiLeaks.
[00:26:46.321 --> 00:26:47.121]  We covered it yesterday.
[00:26:47.982 --> 00:26:49.083]  They admit we're winning, they're losing.
[00:26:51.265 --> 00:26:51.725]  So what do they do?
[00:26:51.765 --> 00:26:52.726]  They say we're being mean.
[00:26:53.026 --> 00:26:57.770]  You say that half of the Trump supporters are deplorable racists.
[00:26:58.751 --> 00:27:01.213]  Then you say I'm racist with no history or no statement of that.
[00:27:02.335 --> 00:27:09.480]  You then say, your surrogates on CNN, MSNBC, ABC say actually all Trump supporters are deplorable.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.283]  Trump supporters are attacked nationwide, physically.
[00:27:14.744 --> 00:27:19.227]  Trump towers are firebombed, vandalized on a weekly basis.
[00:27:20.488 --> 00:27:22.429]  You call us all sorts of horrible names.
[00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:25.371]  You say if we don't support Obamacare, that's a giant screwjob.
[00:27:27.753 --> 00:27:28.954]  That we're racists.
[00:27:31.015 --> 00:27:31.776]  Oh, that's okay.
[00:27:33.635 --> 00:27:34.416]  All that's okay.
[00:27:35.136 --> 00:27:38.519]  But then we stand up for ourselves, and you again try to dictate the rules.
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:49.769]  So this is about a facade media that has almost no viewers, no listeners, getting together and just creating the hoax.
[00:27:49.829 --> 00:28:01.619]  The only power they have is that they are so lock-stepped, so they put out the exact same talking point, and even people don't trust mainstream media, when they see it in a hundred newspapers and ten different networks, all said the same way,
[00:28:02.674 --> 00:28:07.975]  And they've got MSNBC, CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS going, Bill Clinton never settled sexual assault cases.
[00:28:08.195 --> 00:28:10.336]  Bill Clinton never, even though he settled like four of them.
[00:28:11.316 --> 00:28:14.977]  People start questioning, kind of like, there is no death panel on Obamacare.
[00:28:15.097 --> 00:28:15.877]  It is free.
[00:28:16.237 --> 00:28:17.518]  You can keep your doctor.
[00:28:20.058 --> 00:28:21.479]  And then people started getting the fines.
[00:28:22.139 --> 00:28:22.839]  The price went up.
[00:28:23.749 --> 00:28:31.512]  You learned it was a screw job, and then they were so arrogant, Gruber and others, the architects, would go on C-SPAN and say, thank God the public's so dumb.
[00:28:32.232 --> 00:28:49.779]  Now they have celebrations on Charlie Rose's show, saying, thank God they're so dumb, we told them you can get your doctor, and all the sick little lawyers in a club, these young punk lawyers that help write it, brag to Rose that they helped screw the American people, because they don't think you watch Charlie Rose.
[00:28:51.738 --> 00:28:56.882]  They want, criminals want to celebrate the criminal action in their own criminal organization.
[00:28:56.902 --> 00:28:57.583]  This is criminology.
[00:28:59.464 --> 00:29:05.489]  So that's why there's all these videos of the head of the State Department spokesperson, you know, saying, ha ha ha, thank God we're so corrupt, they're so dumb.
[00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:12.915]  That's why you see Gruber sing, and it's why you see these celebrations, is because, we played the videos last week, is because they want to rub it into you.
[00:29:13.135 --> 00:29:16.818]  Remember the top WikiLeaks, from their top advisor,
[00:29:17.967 --> 00:29:28.691]  To Hillary, Mr. Ivey, he says, as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics, and in general conspire to produce unaware and compliant citizenry, he writes.
[00:29:29.492 --> 00:29:30.052]  He's serious.
[00:29:30.492 --> 00:29:32.173]  He goes, and the unawareness remains strong.
[00:29:32.913 --> 00:29:34.714]  But compliance is obviously fading rapidly.
[00:29:36.576 --> 00:29:39.757]  The problem demands some serious, serious thinking and not just poll driven.
[00:29:39.997 --> 00:29:41.598]  We want demographically inspired messaging.
[00:29:41.758 --> 00:29:42.358]  That means race war.
[00:29:42.779 --> 00:29:45.139]  And that's come out in the Soros emails.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.320]  So now you understand.
[00:29:47.701 --> 00:29:48.461]  They're sinking.
[00:29:48.701 --> 00:29:49.441]  They're imploding.
[00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:56.964]  Their only move now is to try to steal the election and start all sorts of civil war, class war in America.
[00:29:57.424 --> 00:29:58.485]  A 1917 operation.
[00:29:59.445 --> 00:30:00.346]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.826 --> 00:30:02.446]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.367 --> 00:30:06.048]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.663 --> 00:30:15.606]  There's an unprecedented crackdown underway against Christians worshipping in secret in Iran.
[00:30:15.787 --> 00:30:20.910]  Iranian police enter family parties and weddings in an effort to find those who turned their backs on Islam.
[00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:33.178]  Iranian Christian news source Mohabbat News reports that a house raid on September 30th resulted in the arrest of five men who were taken to an unknown location and charged with evangelism, a crime that could mean death in Iran.
[00:30:33.278 --> 00:30:40.483]  In a 2016 report, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom said that Christians and other minorities in Iran continue to experience severe
[00:30:40.503 --> 00:30:40.863]  I think so.
[00:31:10.911 --> 00:31:12.633]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.

[00:33:14.562 --> 00:33:16.803]  It's Wednesday, October 12th, 2016.
[00:33:18.604 --> 00:33:21.866]  Only 26 days left in the final countdown.
[00:33:22.606 --> 00:33:23.807]  Election 2016.
[00:33:25.188 --> 00:33:26.769]  Americanism vs. Globalism.
[00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:32.672]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, broadcasting from Austin, Texas, worldwide.
[00:33:34.861 --> 00:33:36.883]  Now, we are not gonzo journalism.
[00:33:36.923 --> 00:33:38.704]  I did not set out to make myself a story.
[00:33:39.205 --> 00:34:01.383]  But because we are so effective at InfoWars.com with our amazing crew, working with other patriots like DrudgeReport.com, Breitbart, WorldNetDaily, Daily Caller, and others, we have the President, the Vice President, Madam Secretary Clinton, Tim Kaine, ABC, NBC, CBS,
[00:34:02.822 --> 00:34:03.202]  All of them.
[00:34:03.523 --> 00:34:04.604]  So many videos coming in.
[00:34:04.644 --> 00:34:05.724]  I can't even see half of them.
[00:34:06.425 --> 00:34:08.206]  I was up late last night watching it come in.
[00:34:08.487 --> 00:34:09.728]  This morning analyzing it.
[00:34:10.368 --> 00:34:13.951]  We're getting hit by thousands of news articles every few hours.
[00:34:14.992 --> 00:34:18.295]  We are being hit by multiple TV attacks every hour.
[00:34:18.955 --> 00:34:21.817]  They've even got C-SPAN guests on doing panels attacking us.
[00:34:21.877 --> 00:34:22.558]  They are going 100%.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.941]  They rigged it with the Republicans.
[00:34:27.042 --> 00:34:28.723]  They had it, they admit, 15 months ago.
[00:34:28.743 --> 00:34:31.025]  To leak this on
[00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:40.141]  To Trump, with his jock talk, where he says the women are throwing themselves on you, you can even grab them.
[00:34:40.722 --> 00:34:42.282]  That's not assault when the woman's on you.
[00:34:42.622 --> 00:34:43.762]  And it's uncouth, I don't like it.
[00:34:43.782 --> 00:34:47.144]  He says he's grown, but it shows that they don't have any history to blackmail him.
[00:34:47.304 --> 00:34:48.184]  They've had to dig this up.
[00:34:49.884 --> 00:34:53.025]  The point is, Hillary is a whole universe's worse.
[00:34:53.465 --> 00:34:58.267]  Not magnitudes, but it just, it's indescribable.
[00:35:00.814 --> 00:35:02.616]  They've got massive WikiLeaks coming out.
[00:35:02.836 --> 00:35:05.719]  Now WikiLeaks, and I said this a few days ago, I said now I see their genius.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:06.880]  It's exponential.
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:11.665]  They go from once a month, to once a week, to every three days, to every day.
[00:35:11.786 --> 00:35:13.087]  Now they're dropping every day.
[00:35:13.107 --> 00:35:16.511]  1,200 more just hit today.
[00:35:16.971 --> 00:35:18.533]  Even more devastating.
[00:35:19.894 --> 00:35:21.396]  Again, that's why
[00:35:23.834 --> 00:35:25.395]  I mean, I'm sitting here with my limited crew trying to go through these.
[00:35:25.455 --> 00:35:26.656]  It's all just total criminality.
[00:35:26.836 --> 00:35:27.737]  Oh, we're going to keep them dumb.
[00:35:27.757 --> 00:35:28.898]  We're going to take what they got.
[00:35:29.058 --> 00:35:30.179]  We're going to get their guns.
[00:35:30.359 --> 00:35:31.540]  We're going to take over the media.
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:38.886]  We're going to cause civil war using Muslims in Europe, and we'll have Catholics and Orthodox killing each other in Ukraine, and we'll have black against white in the U.S.
[00:35:39.266 --> 00:35:40.027]  turn up the rate.
[00:35:40.047 --> 00:35:40.467]  You know what I mean?
[00:35:40.487 --> 00:35:41.368]  It is incredible!
[00:35:43.029 --> 00:35:43.910]  I mean, we have them.
[00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:44.270]  You understand?
[00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:48.153]  This is not our opinion that they say they're losing in their emails.
[00:35:48.534 --> 00:35:51.216]  Hell, in her fundraiser email, she admits that Trump's way ahead.
[00:35:54.448 --> 00:35:59.812]  We've got to get Roger Stone on today to get his take on all the things that are unfolding, because it's just amazing.
[00:36:00.352 --> 00:36:07.217]  He's been so busy on what he says his other October surprises that I've not got his comment yet on Danny Williams.
[00:36:07.237 --> 00:36:13.021]  I know he's aware of the case and covered it over the years, but look at DrugsReport.com if you're a TV viewer or radio listener, you should go there.
[00:36:13.401 --> 00:36:15.183]  CNN orders blackout on Clinton's son.
[00:36:15.203 --> 00:36:16.163]  He'll be here in one hour.
[00:36:16.183 --> 00:36:16.724]  I mean, he's here.
[00:36:17.124 --> 00:36:18.685]  He was just in here during a break earlier.
[00:36:20.026 --> 00:36:22.388]  There he is standing right there at the television that I'm pointing at.
[00:36:23.953 --> 00:36:26.515]  And then, of course, we also tweeted a photo of he and I standing there.
[00:36:26.875 --> 00:36:28.777]  Just so folks know, this is indeed going on.
[00:36:28.837 --> 00:36:31.138]  And listen, I interviewed his aunt.
[00:36:32.059 --> 00:36:36.782]  I went back and checked the records in 1997, and Danny was a young man then.
[00:36:36.802 --> 00:36:38.163]  I mean, he's only 30-something years old now.
[00:36:38.183 --> 00:36:39.924]  Didn't get his full bio.
[00:36:40.725 --> 00:36:41.605]  And he was a little kid then.
[00:36:41.625 --> 00:36:45.208]  I remember having her on then, and they were never even wanting money or anything.
[00:36:45.648 --> 00:36:52.553]  They just wanted him to recognize his son, who Bill gave $700 to every month, and who gave him Christmas presents and stuff.
[00:36:54.741 --> 00:36:58.123]  And who tried to climb the fence when he was a little kid, and all the rest of it.
[00:36:58.163 --> 00:37:01.605]  I mean, this is an epic story, a Greek tragedy.
[00:37:02.146 --> 00:37:03.006]  And I believe Danny.
[00:37:03.867 --> 00:37:06.308]  Then you find out the star, Clinton, did a DNA test and didn't.
[00:37:07.089 --> 00:37:10.030]  So, whether he's Bill Clinton's son or not, I think he is.
[00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:10.891]  He looks just like him.
[00:37:12.032 --> 00:37:13.372]  They could have done a real DNA test.
[00:37:13.392 --> 00:37:21.938]  When Bill Clinton got asked about this a few weeks ago, that video's coming up, he looked extremely, extremely guilty, and did not want to talk, and the campaign started flipping out.
[00:37:23.479 --> 00:37:23.639]  So,
[00:37:25.609 --> 00:37:29.672]  We know Bill Clinton frequented Ladies of the Night, the oldest profession.
[00:37:29.733 --> 00:37:30.333]  I'm not judging him.
[00:37:31.214 --> 00:37:31.954]  Gotta do what you gotta do.
[00:37:33.256 --> 00:37:36.478]  And it won't be the first time elitists have had children out of wedlock.
[00:37:37.699 --> 00:37:39.301]  But the decent ones take care of their children.
[00:37:39.921 --> 00:37:41.923]  Say what you want about Jesse Jackson, he's got four or five?
[00:37:42.924 --> 00:37:45.246]  Turned out each of those women was in a nice house being taken care of.
[00:37:47.185 --> 00:37:57.608]  I thought Democrats that were there in 96, not just on air but off air, they've confirmed that Jesse Jackson would actually try to protect kids and young women and say, watch out, watch out when you got around Bill Clinton.
[00:37:58.268 --> 00:38:01.909]  I mean, even Jesse Jackson, who's got his problems, is better than Bill Clinton.
[00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:07.851]  And that's how, again, entitled these people are, and Hillary's even worse!
[00:38:09.636 --> 00:38:12.117]  Bill just wants to have sex with you, or rape you if he has to.
[00:38:12.877 --> 00:38:14.558]  Hillary wants to rape the whole country and the whole world.
[00:38:14.578 --> 00:38:15.698]  So Danny Williams coming up.
[00:38:15.718 --> 00:38:19.359]  Again, let's put out the tweet because the media says everything is a conspiracy theory.
[00:38:19.379 --> 00:38:20.540]  Let's put the real Alex Jones tweet out.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.740]  We also took a photo of he and I together.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.661]  If we haven't put that out, please tweet that out as well.
[00:38:25.101 --> 00:38:30.203]  Okay, let me get into the latest developments here because they are, they are massive.
[00:38:32.144 --> 00:38:37.125]  Trump has come out and said Hillary wants world government, unlimited immigration, rule by corporations.
[00:38:37.585 --> 00:38:39.146]  That's why they're completely panicking.
[00:38:44.642 --> 00:38:45.442]  So there it is.
[00:38:45.462 --> 00:38:47.643]  We're going to get that video for you.
[00:38:47.863 --> 00:38:53.906]  Hillary wants world government, unlimited immigration, ruled by corporations.
[00:38:56.307 --> 00:38:57.188]  Isn't that just special?
[00:38:59.148 --> 00:39:00.329]  So they can't stand it.
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.302]  Because she's in the emails wanting world government.
[00:39:04.322 --> 00:39:05.523]  World government's now out in the open.
[00:39:06.143 --> 00:39:07.204]  The Pope's calling for it.
[00:39:07.504 --> 00:39:09.906]  They wanted to deny they were building this thing the whole time.
[00:39:10.166 --> 00:39:10.726]  Now it's here.
[00:39:11.066 --> 00:39:11.827]  Now they're doing it.
[00:39:11.867 --> 00:39:13.228]  Now our credibility's giant.
[00:39:13.508 --> 00:39:17.571]  And they want to say we're kooks because we're warning of a private corporate world government and TPP.
[00:39:18.331 --> 00:39:19.132]  And that's what's happening.
[00:39:20.433 --> 00:39:21.694]  We have new Biden audio.
[00:39:21.794 --> 00:39:25.957]  Sabotaged his presidential aspirations.
[00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:29.751]  Biden aid sabotages presidential aspirations.
[00:39:30.192 --> 00:39:34.374]  Surrogates plan to fool bitching Bernie voters.
[00:39:35.134 --> 00:39:38.116]  They send in people as psychological operators to manipulate them.
[00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:41.358]  Clinton staffers discuss which emails to release.
[00:39:42.158 --> 00:39:43.979]  New York Times gave Hillary veto power.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:51.584]  They now have leaks on Hillary, dealing with leaks years ago, or hacks on hacks, where Hillary was directing the New York Times
[00:39:52.512 --> 00:39:58.495]  Okay, we've got leaks, we've got hacks, you've got to report on it, you've got to act like you're journalists, but here's what you're allowed to report on and what you're not.
[00:39:58.735 --> 00:40:02.577]  As I always told you, with the leaks, they only show the weak ones.
[00:40:04.078 --> 00:40:19.927]  That's what they'll talk about as some little side issue when there is an incredible, over-the-top, mega-massive bombshell
[00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:22.429]  Information.
[00:40:28.173 --> 00:40:50.527]  Now, before we continue any further, let's start getting in to why they're freaking out so bad and why they want to claim it's such a defeat that we have Bill Clinton rape protesters popping up at every national event that Hillary, Kaine, Obama, or Clinton, Bill Clinton do.
[00:40:51.937 --> 00:40:53.038]  That's because it's devastating.
[00:40:53.058 --> 00:41:02.182]  And then we've got, during these same confrontations that happened yesterday, three of them, three of them at one event, but all total three separate events that had happened then.
[00:41:02.202 --> 00:41:03.743]  So that's six disruptions.
[00:41:04.043 --> 00:41:06.845]  They send people to go disrupt Trump rallies screaming racist.
[00:41:07.325 --> 00:41:07.985]  That's not true.
[00:41:08.186 --> 00:41:09.806]  We're here screaming rapist, which is true.
[00:41:09.846 --> 00:41:10.747]  You settled rape cases.
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:19.222]  But first I want to play Obama responds to Alex Jones sulfur comment, which I covered earlier in the week.
[00:41:19.822 --> 00:41:25.345]  And if you're a new viewer and like he's not responding to you, CNN, the Associated Press, Mother Jones, they're all quite clear.
[00:41:25.365 --> 00:41:28.646]  He's responding to the evil radio host Alex Jones.
[00:41:29.426 --> 00:41:30.747]  They're just so afraid.
[00:41:34.093 --> 00:41:38.257]  To ever actually say who we are so people come here and find out what we're saying.
[00:41:38.437 --> 00:41:39.559]  They'll say Rush Limbaugh's name.
[00:41:39.759 --> 00:41:40.880]  They'll say Sean Hannity's name.
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.242]  They won't say this one because it's so damning.
[00:41:43.823 --> 00:41:45.645]  Because I'll cross-reference everything.
[00:41:45.685 --> 00:41:46.986]  I'll show you the backgrounds of it.
[00:41:47.266 --> 00:41:47.927]  I'm unfiltered.
[00:41:47.987 --> 00:41:48.668]  I'm uncontrolled.
[00:41:48.868 --> 00:41:49.789]  I'm not on a big network.
[00:41:50.209 --> 00:41:51.931]  But I've built something bigger than what they've got.
[00:41:52.051 --> 00:41:53.232]  That's what they can't stand.
[00:41:53.713 --> 00:41:55.134]  There's not much else out there like that.
[00:41:55.414 --> 00:41:55.715]  Drudge.
[00:41:57.708 --> 00:42:01.732]  That's why they're trying to shut down the free internet.
[00:42:02.592 --> 00:42:05.315]  That's why they're bringing in all these regulations and admitting they want to shut it down.
[00:42:05.935 --> 00:42:07.697]  First they didn't want to shut down free speech, now they admit it.
[00:42:07.977 --> 00:42:11.420]  First they didn't want to double tax you with Obamacare, now they admit it.
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.622]  First there weren't death panels, now there is.
[00:42:14.723 --> 00:42:18.086]  First they weren't coming after your guns, now they admit they want to ban them.
[00:42:18.166 --> 00:42:19.047]  And that's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:42:19.267 --> 00:42:20.468]  But hell, that's in the newspapers!
[00:42:24.471 --> 00:42:28.052]  So, they're in a lot of trouble because first the NSA wasn't spying on you, now it is.
[00:42:28.072 --> 00:42:29.233]  Because it always was.
[00:42:30.913 --> 00:42:39.416]  So he makes this joke about me saying he's got flies landing on him, which biblically is associated with the underworld, with Satanism, with corruption.
[00:42:39.756 --> 00:42:41.416]  But all I'm saying is it's an archetype.
[00:42:41.777 --> 00:42:48.639]  The actions of Obama and Hillary are war and death and corruption and poverty and wanting to make us poor so they can control us.
[00:42:48.939 --> 00:42:50.059]  That's an aspect of evil.
[00:42:50.219 --> 00:42:51.440]  They don't want prosperity.
[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:52.260]  Let's go to that clip.
[00:42:53.697 --> 00:42:54.977]  They demonize each other.
[00:42:56.018 --> 00:42:57.578]  And I mean that literally, by the way.
[00:42:57.678 --> 00:43:05.061]  I was reading the other day, there's a guy on the radio who apparently trumps on his show frequently.
[00:43:05.081 --> 00:43:06.922]  He said me and Hillary are demons.
[00:43:08.482 --> 00:43:10.163]  Said we smell like sulfur.
[00:43:10.523 --> 00:43:11.223]  Ain't that something?
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:27.041]  I mean, come on, people!
[00:43:28.081 --> 00:43:29.221]  You know, did you pick up on that?
[00:43:29.281 --> 00:43:30.622]  Bill Clinton's so good at that.
[00:43:30.962 --> 00:43:33.602]  Yesterday he's like, listen, I can tell you these rednecks are racist.
[00:43:34.022 --> 00:43:36.503]  Trump's got bad people that are out to get you.
[00:43:37.583 --> 00:43:38.984]  I used to be one, okay?
[00:43:39.124 --> 00:43:39.984]  I used to be a redneck.
[00:43:40.004 --> 00:43:41.524]  No, you were a Dixie Mafia.
[00:43:42.605 --> 00:43:43.525]  Son of the mafia.
[00:43:45.043 --> 00:43:49.364]  You were brought in to dominate the poor white people, black people, and others of Arkansas.
[00:43:49.404 --> 00:43:52.425]  You did such a good job of the CIA, they put you in charge of the whole country.
[00:43:52.625 --> 00:43:56.365]  What you are is a predator, Bill Clinton, and you're showing race baiting.
[00:43:57.586 --> 00:43:58.686]  That's the latest clip we've got.
[00:43:59.066 --> 00:44:06.547]  But Rachel Maddow went crazy last night dealing with all of this and trying to misrepresent what we're saying and what we're doing.
[00:44:07.488 --> 00:44:09.128]  So let's go ahead and play this report.
[00:44:10.017 --> 00:44:14.039]  A new phenomenon that you may have noticed at recent Democratic rallies.
[00:44:14.099 --> 00:44:16.060]  We first saw it in Las Vegas Thursday night.
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:21.222]  Tim Kaine was interrupted by a protester who was wearing a shirt that said rape on it.
[00:44:21.862 --> 00:44:24.563]  And the guy yelled out, Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[00:44:25.083 --> 00:44:26.464]  That first happened Thursday night.
[00:44:27.124 --> 00:44:30.426]  Then we saw it happen multiple times at multiple Clinton events today.
[00:44:30.606 --> 00:44:33.227]  Including one where the featured speaker was President Obama.
[00:44:33.647 --> 00:44:36.088]  And one where the featured speaker was Bill Clinton himself.
[00:44:38.832 --> 00:44:39.753]  Oh no!
[00:44:39.773 --> 00:44:40.193]  Uh oh!
[00:44:40.253 --> 00:44:42.475]  Somebody's yelling at me again.
[00:45:20.757 --> 00:45:25.424]  There's a guy on the radio who apparently trumps on his show frequently.
[00:45:25.444 --> 00:45:27.267]  He said me and Hillary are demons.
[00:45:28.849 --> 00:45:30.552]  Said we smell like sulfur.
[00:45:30.873 --> 00:45:31.574]  Ain't that something?
[00:45:37.039 --> 00:45:38.260]  There's a guy on the radio.
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:45.163]  The guy on the radio is Alex Jones, who runs the Infowars Conspiracy Theory website and internet radio show.
[00:45:45.483 --> 00:45:49.405]  And in fact, he does call President Obama and Hillary Clinton demons.
[00:45:49.505 --> 00:45:51.205]  He says they smell like sulfur.
[00:45:51.586 --> 00:45:56.668]  He says he has it on good authority that they are, in fact, literally possessed by demons.
[00:45:58.493 --> 00:46:04.216]  He is an abject psychopathic demon from hell that as soon as she gets into power is going to try to destroy the planet.
[00:46:04.356 --> 00:46:05.036]  I'm sure of that.
[00:46:05.256 --> 00:46:12.399]  And people around her say she's so dark now and so evil and so possessed that they are having nightmares.
[00:46:12.759 --> 00:46:13.520]  They're freaking out.
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:15.040]  Folks, let me just tell you something.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:16.861]  If the media wants to go with this, that's fine.
[00:46:17.762 --> 00:46:24.625]  There are dozens of videos and photos of Obama having flies land on him indoors at all times of year.
[00:46:24.965 --> 00:46:27.126]  And he'll be next to 100 people and no one has flies on.
[00:46:28.618 --> 00:46:29.579]  Hillary, reportedly.
[00:46:29.599 --> 00:46:34.983]  I mean, I always told people around her that they think she's demon possessed, okay?
[00:46:35.024 --> 00:46:36.184]  I'm just gonna go ahead and say it, okay?
[00:46:36.205 --> 00:46:39.127]  All right, ready to connect the dots?
[00:46:40.068 --> 00:46:43.311]  The guy who says he has it on good authority.
[00:46:44.457 --> 00:46:46.939]  That President Obama and Hillary Clinton are literally demons.
[00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:51.863]  He's the reason we're getting the people screaming rape at all the Clinton events now.
[00:46:51.923 --> 00:47:07.796]  Because he and his conspiracy theory demon possession website, they are now, in support of the Trump campaign, they are now offering a $1,000 bounty to anyone who can get a Bill Clinton rape shirt on TV for at least five seconds.
[00:47:08.096 --> 00:47:12.119]  They're offering a $5,000 bounty to anybody who can be heard on TV
[00:47:12.159 --> 00:47:15.701]  Maybe saying Bill Clinton is a rapist while wearing the shirt.
[00:47:16.022 --> 00:47:17.022]  See, it's a way to sell shirts.
[00:47:18.103 --> 00:47:22.126]  So these protests breaking out at Democratic rallies, they're not organic, right?
[00:47:22.166 --> 00:47:31.032]  They are highly coordinated with a monetary incentive by Donald Trump's number one Internet radio conservative, Internet conspiracy theory supporter.
[00:47:31.552 --> 00:47:35.595]  The guy who also says President Obama is a demon because the flies tell him so.
[00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:37.970]  So there you have it.
[00:47:38.071 --> 00:47:38.531]  Ta-da!
[00:47:38.871 --> 00:47:39.772]  Dots connected.
[00:47:40.172 --> 00:47:41.292]  Nausea induced.
[00:47:42.613 --> 00:47:43.254]  We'll be right back.
[00:47:44.114 --> 00:47:54.040]  Monsieur Maddow, I can tell that you have a certain persuasion in your life by your mannerisms and how you act and behave.
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:56.982]  I don't care about that persuasion, but that's what told me not to fly.
[00:47:58.089 --> 00:48:17.899]  Now, in the case of that, I was baiting you, just like I baited you about election fraud, to cause a national debate, and have Obama deny it exists, I know how you'd operate, and then have you panic and force a public takeover of Homeland Security of elections, because I knew it was already planned from my sources.
[00:48:18.359 --> 00:48:19.780]  I devastated you.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:23.542]  You are a small-time jackass that reads off a teleprompter.
[00:48:23.762 --> 00:48:24.122]  I don't!
[00:48:26.371 --> 00:48:36.837]  I read off history and deep research in my sources, and believe me, you think you've got that tottering, doddering Hillary as your goddess telling you what to say and what to do?
[00:48:36.897 --> 00:48:37.697]  It's in all the WikiLeaks.
[00:48:39.438 --> 00:48:40.859]  We have the good people in government.
[00:48:40.899 --> 00:48:46.382]  We have the good people in corporations in this country and worldwide that don't want to live under your evil, that are aware of you.
[00:48:46.662 --> 00:48:48.503]  I'm just one manifestation of that.
[00:48:50.644 --> 00:48:52.705]  Cut me down, two more will grow back.
[00:48:52.725 --> 00:48:53.986]  That's how it works.
[00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:57.687]  And so, you know that.
[00:48:57.947 --> 00:48:59.008]  You're doing a big conference game.
[00:48:59.188 --> 00:49:00.629]  This morning they told me, did you see Maddow attack you?
[00:49:00.649 --> 00:49:02.030]  And I said, no.
[00:49:03.151 --> 00:49:05.072]  But she'll say, we've discovered the secret.
[00:49:05.152 --> 00:49:06.113]  He's paying people.
[00:49:06.193 --> 00:49:06.873]  It's all fake.
[00:49:06.913 --> 00:49:08.394]  Kind of like, we discovered a secret.
[00:49:09.114 --> 00:49:11.636]  Oh, he was on Howard Stern at Secret Tapes.
[00:49:11.656 --> 00:49:12.977]  No, it was live on the radio.
[00:49:13.477 --> 00:49:14.758]  With him asking him dirty questions.
[00:49:15.278 --> 00:49:16.319]  Trump never hid any of that.
[00:49:17.159 --> 00:49:17.800]  That's the whole point.
[00:49:19.235 --> 00:49:20.837]  Wow, new Howard Stern stuff.
[00:49:21.697 --> 00:49:24.220]  Man, boy, oh boy.
[00:49:25.221 --> 00:49:27.283]  And as soon as, I hadn't even watched that until we played it.
[00:49:27.323 --> 00:49:28.464]  I said, I want to see it play it.
[00:49:29.184 --> 00:49:30.806]  I told the crew what it would be, because I know.
[00:49:31.647 --> 00:49:32.287]  Oh, we caught him.
[00:49:32.307 --> 00:49:33.869]  They're not doing this for ideological reasons.
[00:49:33.889 --> 00:49:34.589]  They're doing it for money.
[00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:36.511]  Really, a lot of folks have told us they don't want the money.
[00:49:36.852 --> 00:49:37.933]  We did it to make it interesting.
[00:49:38.113 --> 00:49:38.914]  You know who didn't want the money?
[00:49:38.934 --> 00:49:39.654]  You can Google this.
[00:49:39.714 --> 00:49:42.197]  It was the WikiLeaks, you know, back in July, early July.
[00:49:43.323 --> 00:49:44.183]  Right for the RNC?
[00:49:44.703 --> 00:49:54.005]  That Hillary had paid with George Soros and move on to send buses all over the country to Trump events dressed up like Bernie Sanders to attack Trump supporters and blame Trump and then blame Sanders?
[00:49:54.886 --> 00:50:08.189]  You're paying people to go beat people up and scream racist and throw eggs in people's faces and beat them over the head with Mexican flags putting out lies and then stealing the nomination of Bernie Sanders.
[00:50:08.489 --> 00:50:09.389]  We're simply saying he's
[00:50:12.076 --> 00:50:16.058]  Gone out and he has settled the sexual assault cases and other cases.
[00:50:16.859 --> 00:50:23.303]  There's a news blackout, just like there's a CNN news blackout, they admit, Drudge has the source, on Danny Williams, who's coming up in 50 minutes.
[00:50:24.663 --> 00:50:32.968]  There is a blackout on talking about rape of Bill Clinton, talking about sexual abuse, talking about settling cases, talking about any of the other women.
[00:50:33.889 --> 00:50:34.069]  Okay?
[00:50:35.523 --> 00:50:36.204]  That's what's going on.
[00:50:36.884 --> 00:50:39.386]  And Hillary has completely, absolutely ignored him.
[00:50:39.406 --> 00:50:41.808]  We have video of Bill Clinton totally ignoring him.
[00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:44.671]  And we're here causing a national debate.
[00:50:44.971 --> 00:50:46.612]  We know we have a bigger audience than CNN.
[00:50:47.093 --> 00:50:48.354]  We're calling their bluff.
[00:50:48.454 --> 00:50:49.535]  We're taking action.
[00:50:50.396 --> 00:50:51.356]  We're in their face.
[00:50:52.678 --> 00:50:54.339]  And absolutely, people say, man, you have a lot of courage.
[00:50:54.479 --> 00:50:55.140]  Absolutely, I do.
[00:50:56.337 --> 00:51:05.936]  But it takes greater courage to let these demons, these globalists, take over these monsters, these fascists, these oppressors, these tyrants run our lives.
[00:51:06.036 --> 00:51:07.418]  I can't help but resist them.
[00:51:10.712 --> 00:51:13.373]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[00:51:13.613 --> 00:51:16.674]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[00:51:17.014 --> 00:51:17.754]  Because it's already here.
[00:51:18.134 --> 00:51:18.814]  It's being announced.
[00:51:19.154 --> 00:51:22.635]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[00:51:23.055 --> 00:51:25.016]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:51:25.096 --> 00:51:26.636]  A new battleship in the fight.
[00:51:26.836 --> 00:51:27.837]  InfoWars Live.
[00:51:28.017 --> 00:51:28.857]  Available right now.
[00:51:29.117 --> 00:51:30.477]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[00:51:30.918 --> 00:51:33.298]  You gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[00:51:33.318 --> 00:51:34.919]  Or you gonna be part of history?
[00:51:35.479 --> 00:51:38.500]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:39.540]  Take action!
[00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:46.384]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:51:46.764 --> 00:51:49.646]  Dr. Grip, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:51:50.006 --> 00:51:55.189]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:51:55.589 --> 00:52:01.573]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:52:01.713 --> 00:52:04.855]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:52:04.995 --> 00:52:06.456]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[00:52:06.656 --> 00:52:10.800]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:13.862]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:52:13.922 --> 00:52:15.504]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:52:15.604 --> 00:52:18.767]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:52:19.067 --> 00:52:21.389]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:52:21.669 --> 00:52:22.630]  It's in powder form.
[00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:25.432]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:52:25.613 --> 00:52:26.613]  I take this.
[00:52:26.734 --> 00:52:28.015]  This is the product that I take.
[00:52:28.135 --> 00:52:30.117]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:52:30.918 --> 00:52:31.700]  We fight the Globals.
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:32.562]  We fight the New World Order.

[00:52:45.892 --> 00:52:49.193]  After the election, this t-shirt will no longer be available.

[00:52:55.595 --> 00:52:59.496]  Even Hillary Clinton supporters like the Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[00:52:59.696 --> 00:53:01.117]  I'm voting for Hillary.
[00:53:01.417 --> 00:53:05.759]  This is a meme that is still viral worldwide, Hillary for Prison.
[00:53:06.059 --> 00:53:11.761]  Folks, we want to see Hillary Clinton put in prison, and we also want to see InfoWars go to the next level.
[00:53:12.061 --> 00:53:13.261]  Help us accomplish both.
[00:53:13.461 --> 00:53:25.886]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today, get your Hillary for Prison t-shirt, fund us in the InfoWar, start a political discourse with your neighbor, give a gift to a friend, get your piece of history today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:53:43.124 --> 00:53:47.247]  Intruder alert!
[00:53:56.413 --> 00:54:00.356]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:54:00.376 --> 00:54:06.300]  These people are coming for everybody!
[00:54:22.814 --> 00:54:24.315]  I don't know.
[00:54:38.598 --> 00:54:41.619]  Trump's talked about the fact that he's now talked to the insiders.
[00:54:42.399 --> 00:54:43.280]  You got Jerry Falwell Jr.
[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:48.962]  and others have come out and said, no, there was a Republican conspiracy to leak this info and derail this for Hillary.
[00:54:49.462 --> 00:54:57.184]  It's not a... if three or more people meet, or two or more really, and decide to try to do somebody harm, it is a conspiracy under law, but they said they were still going to get Trump.
[00:54:57.445 --> 00:54:59.425]  They said they wanted Hillary over Trump.
[00:55:02.066 --> 00:55:04.367]  They said they were going to be part of this the entire time.
[00:55:06.104 --> 00:55:06.884]  See, that's what's crazy.
[00:55:07.544 --> 00:55:13.406]  Charlie Rose has guests on from the White House saying, we lied to everybody and told them they could keep their doctor, and then they laugh about it.
[00:55:15.006 --> 00:55:16.467]  I played the thing like 10 times last week.
[00:55:17.727 --> 00:55:20.868]  The week before that, they were on TV making fun of people about something else.
[00:55:20.888 --> 00:55:32.371]  The week before that, they do victory laps on C-SPAN and on PBS, where they think it's a more intellectual audience, about how they're conning everyone.
[00:55:34.039 --> 00:55:39.480]  I mean, do you understand, folks, these people are literally mentally ill, in my view.
[00:55:41.821 --> 00:55:47.983]  Because they think they're the only ones that are smart, and they think everybody that is smart must be a predator like they are.
[00:55:48.483 --> 00:55:53.224]  I've had globals try to hire me so many times, we've talked about it, and they tell you, you're smart like us, join us.
[00:55:54.124 --> 00:55:55.144]  Don't be all the scum.
[00:55:56.365 --> 00:55:57.165]  They're so elitist.
[00:55:58.254 --> 00:56:01.556]  Now I've got a bunch of clips I want to play here when we come back.
[00:56:02.677 --> 00:56:08.101]  We've got Obama being interrupted three times yesterday by folks exposing Bill Clinton's rape.
[00:56:09.301 --> 00:56:12.003]  We've got new Donald Trump ad that's very powerful targeting Hillary's health.
[00:56:12.704 --> 00:56:16.646]  We've got Mike Huckabee compares Trump to Captain Quint hunting jaws.
[00:56:17.547 --> 00:56:19.208]  And they go, yeah, but Captain Quint died.
[00:56:21.069 --> 00:56:23.251]  The point is he got the shark dead too.
[00:56:24.212 --> 00:56:25.533]  No, how come he knew what he was doing?
[00:56:25.633 --> 00:56:27.354]  Great, great allegory.
[00:56:27.854 --> 00:56:31.717]  Quint is brask, he cusses, he's nasty, but he's the good guy.
[00:56:32.597 --> 00:56:43.885]  Just like in Lord of the Rings, not the movie, but the book, they say to Aragorn, they say, well, why didn't you go with those other guys who were going to slit your throat once they got you out of here?
[00:56:43.905 --> 00:56:51.890]  And he goes, well, they looked fair, but felt foul, while you look foul, but feel fair.
[00:56:54.605 --> 00:56:58.090]  The best people I've ever known aren't perfect, and I'm not lauding being foul.
[00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:07.824]  I'm not lauding being worldly and nasty, but nasty at a base level of just the flesh, like loving women, loving to fight, you know.
[00:57:11.664 --> 00:57:16.446]  Those are the people, though, that have the heights in their psyche of wanting to build things and loving God and being good.
[00:57:16.626 --> 00:57:22.989]  Their good side's so big that they've got a big evil side, but it's still much smaller than the big good side they have.
[00:57:23.669 --> 00:57:29.632]  You run into people that are totally controlled and focused and a little twinkly-eyed, like Paul Ryan.
[00:57:29.652 --> 00:57:30.552]  That's a psychopath.
[00:57:30.592 --> 00:57:34.834]  I can take one look at Paul Ryan and tell you, that man is a psychopath.
[00:57:35.514 --> 00:57:36.414]  He's not a sociopath.
[00:57:36.815 --> 00:57:37.715]  He's a psychopath.
[00:57:40.697 --> 00:57:42.618]  I'm going to go to break, come back with all of this in the second hour.
[00:57:42.658 --> 00:57:44.459]  We haven't even scratched the surface of the new WikiLeaks.
[00:57:44.519 --> 00:57:45.239]  This is amazing.
[00:57:45.259 --> 00:57:47.361]  WikiLeaks has really come through, so that's good to see that happen.
[00:57:47.981 --> 00:57:48.921]  The listeners have come through.
[00:57:48.961 --> 00:57:49.422]  You're amazing.
[00:57:49.462 --> 00:57:50.082]  God bless you.
[00:57:50.622 --> 00:57:52.964]  I've extended it one day, but it's over because people are asking me to.
[00:57:53.264 --> 00:57:55.825]  DNA Force will end tonight, 23% off.
[00:57:55.885 --> 00:58:00.788]  The new special is on a very inexpensive product we have that is the highest quality.
[00:58:01.368 --> 00:58:03.589]  This is really an amazing product.
[00:58:03.889 --> 00:58:05.450]  Knockout Sleep Support, 25% off, flash sale.
[00:58:07.031 --> 00:58:13.694]  For only 48 hours only, and it's got, in 1995, that's what the leading competitor cost, just of this amount of melatonin.
[00:58:13.934 --> 00:58:17.416]  Then it's got the L-tryptophan, and the valerian route, and a bunch of other stuff in it.
[00:58:17.436 --> 00:58:18.256]  The best sleep ever.
[00:58:18.536 --> 00:58:19.417]  This is so amazing.
[00:58:19.477 --> 00:58:19.937]  Knockout.

[00:58:32.803 --> 00:58:33.243]  Stay with us.
[00:58:37.791 --> 00:58:41.112]  With only 26 days left, we have entered the final stretch.
[00:58:41.593 --> 00:58:43.914]  More of this historic broadcast on the other side.
[00:58:44.794 --> 00:58:47.095]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:58:51.617 --> 00:58:54.978]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:55.018 --> 00:58:57.219]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:00.502 --> 00:59:05.369]  Russia has ordered all of its officials to fly home, including any relatives living abroad.
[00:59:05.529 --> 00:59:09.594]  This news comes as tension mounts over the prospect of pending global war.
[00:59:09.614 --> 00:59:14.821]  A failure to heed the instruction could put promotion chances at risk, according to local reports from Moscow.
[00:59:15.282 --> 00:59:18.043]  This news comes amid worsening relations between Russia and the U.S.
[00:59:18.143 --> 00:59:18.884]  over Syria.
[00:59:19.024 --> 00:59:24.226]  Politicians and high-ranking figures are said to have received a direct warning from Russian President Vladimir Putin.
[00:59:24.346 --> 00:59:30.189]  This news comes as Putin has cancelled a planned visit to France amid conflict over Moscow's role in the Syrian theater.
[00:59:30.369 --> 00:59:36.132]  Just days after this news emerged, the Kremlin has moved nuclear-capable missiles near the Polish border.
[00:59:36.332 --> 00:59:43.295]  Russian political analyst Stanislav Bilkowski said this is all part of a package of measures to prepare elites to some big war.
[00:59:43.635 --> 00:59:45.517]  Relations between Russia and the U.S.
[00:59:45.677 --> 00:59:49.320]  are at their lowest since the Cold War and continue to deteriorate.
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:56.746]  Even former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has warned the world is in a dangerous point due to rising tensions between Russia and the U.S.
[00:59:56.987 --> 00:59:59.769]  I'm Margaret Hale reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:00:02.531 --> 01:00:05.194]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:17.792 --> 01:00:21.795]  Benny Williams is coming out with the first of his report.
[01:00:21.815 --> 01:00:23.556]  What answers?
[01:00:23.596 --> 01:00:25.017]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:25.177 --> 01:00:26.778]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.818 --> 01:00:40.087]  John Adams, signer of the Declaration of Independence and the second president of the United States, told the military in a speech made in 1798, our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people.
[01:00:40.248 --> 01:00:43.450]  It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.
[01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:46.612]  And it was Prussian statesman, Otto von Bismarck,
[01:00:46.832 --> 01:00:57.302]  Shaking his fist at the United States who said there is a Providence that protects idiots, drunkards, children, and the United States of America.
[01:00:57.583 --> 01:01:01.947]  And that protection was on full display at the second presidential debate.
[01:01:02.087 --> 01:01:10.636]  With all of the New World Order's media and all of the New World Order's CIA operatives, they just couldn't put Humpty Dumpty Hillary back together again.
[01:01:11.076 --> 01:01:22.479]  Isn't it ironic that the roughly 28 million people watching the second presidential debate witnessed in live time the crushing weight of American Providence in action?
[01:01:22.719 --> 01:01:24.620]  The symbolism was palatable.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.882]  Just as Obama had been plagued by flies as his two-faced politics took the reins of power of the nation,
[01:01:31.802 --> 01:01:33.544]  Uh, this guy's bothering me here.
[01:01:34.264 --> 01:01:36.746]  Of, uh, our... Sorry.
[01:01:37.387 --> 01:01:38.748]  Sorry, I'm gonna start over.
[01:01:39.208 --> 01:01:40.910]  I'm gonna start at, I will contrast.
[01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:41.931]  Hey!
[01:01:42.691 --> 01:01:49.797]  Beelzebub, Lord of the Flies, made yet another appearance, clinging to Hillary's evil, glowing radiance.
[01:01:50.157 --> 01:01:58.244]  First, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[01:01:58.384 --> 01:02:00.346]  He gets to decide what he wants to talk about,
[01:02:00.566 --> 01:02:10.495]  And in one of the strangest presidential debates in American history, a former president meekly sat on the sidelines faced with three of the women he raped.
[01:02:10.876 --> 01:02:17.842]  Meanwhile, Hillary, in true arrogant oblom, railed on Donald Trump about a joke he made 11 years ago.
[01:02:17.982 --> 01:02:22.226]  And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.
[01:02:23.424 --> 01:02:29.233]  But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.
[01:02:29.854 --> 01:02:31.897]  Because we've seen this throughout the campaign.
[01:02:33.219 --> 01:02:35.362]  We have seen him insult women.
[01:02:36.544 --> 01:02:38.026]  We've seen him rate women.
[01:02:39.147 --> 01:02:42.389]  On their appearance, ranking them from 1 to 10.
[01:02:43.129 --> 01:02:44.630]  Then Providence struck.
[01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:50.012]  You can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[01:02:50.352 --> 01:02:56.355]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously, four of them here tonight.
[01:02:57.055 --> 01:03:02.298]  One of the women, who is a wonderful woman at 12 years old, was raped.
[01:03:03.178 --> 01:03:03.678]  At 12.
[01:03:04.339 --> 01:03:11.523]  Her client, she represented, got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.
[01:03:12.423 --> 01:03:15.785]  Kathy Shelton, that young woman, is here with us tonight.
[01:03:16.725 --> 01:03:18.826]  So, don't tell me about words.
[01:03:19.227 --> 01:03:22.288]  I am absolutely, I apologize for those words.
[01:03:23.749 --> 01:03:24.770]  President Clinton did.
[01:03:24.790 --> 01:03:25.570]  He was impeached.
[01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:27.932]  He lost his license to practice law.
[01:03:28.692 --> 01:03:35.857]  He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.
[01:03:36.717 --> 01:03:49.686]  And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that, and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.
[01:03:51.988 --> 01:03:53.419]  Can we please hold the applause?
[01:03:54.963 --> 01:04:04.230]  Bill, Hillary, Obama, the CIA, United Nations, New World Order, the sleeping giant is awake, and it just had you for breakfast.
[01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:06.091]  She got caught in a total lie.
[01:04:06.772 --> 01:04:13.857]  Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs, and everybody else, and she said things, WikiLeaks, that just came out.
[01:04:14.958 --> 01:04:16.319]  Her falling down on 9-11 was process.
[01:04:16.359 --> 01:04:20.382]  Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln.
[01:04:20.582 --> 01:04:21.662]  That's one that I haven't...
[01:04:22.623 --> 01:04:35.450]  But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 emails that you deleted and that you acid washed.
[01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:42.514]  And then the two boxes of emails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.
[01:04:43.274 --> 01:04:46.895]  So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what?
[01:04:47.375 --> 01:04:56.197]  People have been, their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done, and it's a disgrace, and honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[01:04:56.217 --> 01:04:57.757]  Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.
[01:04:57.817 --> 01:05:03.338]  I'm going to let you talk about it now, because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised.
[01:05:03.818 --> 01:05:08.359]  In the first debate, in the first- John Bowne for InfoWars.com.
[01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:14.827]  There's an unprecedented crackdown underway against Christians worshipping in secret in Iran.
[01:05:15.007 --> 01:05:20.131]  Iranian police inter-family parties and weddings in an effort to find those who've turned their backs on Islam.
[01:05:20.411 --> 01:05:32.039]  Iranian Christian news source Mohabat News reports that a house raid on September 30th resulted in the arrest of five men who were taken to an unknown location and charged with evangelism, a crime that could mean death in Iran.
[01:05:32.079 --> 01:05:39.684]  In a 2016 report, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom said that Christians and other minorities in Iran continue to experience severe
[01:05:39.824 --> 01:05:40.084]  I think so.
[01:06:09.918 --> 01:06:15.424]  InfoWars is proud to announce the official InfoWars Live app available now for iPhone and Android.

[01:06:42.493 --> 01:06:46.057]  We've seen example after example of cable news networks attempting to deceive you.
[01:06:46.317 --> 01:06:54.944]  In short, the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces who are trying to sway public opinion in an unnatural direction that only serves establishment agendas.
[01:06:55.184 --> 01:06:59.968]  But InfoWars Live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.

[01:07:15.443 --> 01:07:18.746]  After the election, this t-shirt will no longer be available.
[01:07:18.986 --> 01:07:24.631]  We only have a finite number of these, so be sure to get to Infowarsstore.com and get yours today.
[01:07:25.151 --> 01:07:29.034]  Even Hillary Clinton supporters like the Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[01:07:29.255 --> 01:07:30.656]  I'm voting for Hillary.
[01:07:30.956 --> 01:07:34.160]  This is a meme that is still viral worldwide.
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:35.302]  Hillary for prison.
[01:07:35.602 --> 01:07:41.309]  Folks, we want to see Hillary Clinton put in prison, and we also want to see InfoWars go to the next level.
[01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:48.198]  It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.
[01:07:48.839 --> 01:07:49.760]  Because you'd be in jail.
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:51.661]  Help us accomplish both.
[01:07:52.161 --> 01:07:53.542]  Fund us in the InfoWars.

[01:08:15.148 --> 01:08:21.390]  I mean, she is an abject, psychopathic demon from hell that as soon as she gets into power is going to try to destroy the planet.
[01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:24.992]  She's worked like a demon, as you know, at Secretary of State.
[01:08:25.352 --> 01:08:27.953]  We came, we saw, he died.
[01:08:30.174 --> 01:08:32.695]  What difference, at this point, does it make?
[01:08:33.135 --> 01:08:43.799]  And there's only one candidate in this race who understands that democracy in a big, diverse country doesn't work if you constantly demonize each other, demonize each other.
[01:08:44.554 --> 01:08:49.375]  You could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.
[01:08:49.915 --> 01:08:51.476]  And I mean that literally, by the way.
[01:08:51.576 --> 01:08:58.578]  I was reading the other day, there's a guy on the radio who apparently trumps on his show frequently.
[01:08:58.638 --> 01:09:00.398]  He said, me and Hillary are demons.
[01:09:00.978 --> 01:09:01.739]  I'm telling you.
[01:09:04.519 --> 01:09:05.480]  She is a demon.
[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:08.720]  This is biblical.
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:10.741]  She's going to launch a nuclear war.
[01:09:12.449 --> 01:09:14.270]  We said we'd smell like something.
[01:09:14.570 --> 01:09:15.331]  Ain't that something?
[01:09:24.616 --> 01:09:28.839]  Now... I mean... Come on, people!
[01:09:33.402 --> 01:09:35.682]  You can't wash that evil off, Ken, of Hillary.
[01:09:35.722 --> 01:09:44.524]  I'm not kidding, people say, they say, folks, I've been told this by high up folks, they say, listen, Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[01:09:44.584 --> 01:09:49.205]  I never said this because the media will go crazy with it, but I've talked to people that are in protective details.
[01:09:50.205 --> 01:09:55.686]  I mean, they're scared of it, and they say, listen, she's a freaking demon and she stinks, and so does Obama.
[01:09:55.726 --> 01:09:56.346]  And I go, like, what?
[01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:57.326]  Sulfur.
[01:09:58.187 --> 01:09:59.767]  They smell like hell.
[01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:04.590]  On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C.
[01:10:04.650 --> 01:10:09.652]  will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.
[01:10:09.672 --> 01:10:10.892]  It's about time.
[01:10:11.513 --> 01:10:12.173]  Look at those crowds.
[01:10:12.193 --> 01:10:17.435]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[01:10:17.455 --> 01:10:27.238]  So much of what he says isn't true, and a damn fly lands right on her eyeball.
[01:10:29.118 --> 01:10:30.439]  Oh, man, it's amazing.
[01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:33.160]  I believe Danny Williams' story.
[01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:34.901]  I interviewed his aunt.
[01:10:35.461 --> 01:10:36.961]  I remember talking about it and covering it.
[01:10:36.982 --> 01:10:39.562]  I went back and did some research and found references to it.
[01:10:39.582 --> 01:10:43.663]  And I remember his aunt, the old church lady, hard-working lady that raised him.
[01:10:43.964 --> 01:10:47.124]  Back when he was like 10 years old at the time.
[01:10:48.485 --> 01:10:52.926]  And because the media is spreading this, oh there's some guy from Arkansas claiming he's Bill Clinton's elementary kid.
[01:10:52.946 --> 01:10:54.006]  Here's a dirty trick.
[01:10:55.227 --> 01:10:55.647]  Dirty trick?
[01:10:56.792 --> 01:10:59.833]  It's been him trying to climb the fence when he was a little kid to see his daddy.
[01:11:00.633 --> 01:11:03.533]  Clinton didn't do a DNA test like he said he did.
[01:11:03.553 --> 01:11:04.214]  That was all fake.
[01:11:04.774 --> 01:11:05.454]  We looked into it.
[01:11:05.474 --> 01:11:08.234]  It was a tabloid owned by the Clintons' friends.
[01:11:10.275 --> 01:11:11.055]  That's all coming up.
[01:11:11.975 --> 01:11:14.896]  But this is just about how evil these people are and how fake they are.
[01:11:14.916 --> 01:11:16.216]  That's why we're covering this today.
[01:11:18.837 --> 01:11:25.298]  So, Infowars.com exclusive, Danny Williams, the reported son of Bill Clinton, in studio.
[01:11:27.731 --> 01:11:29.632]  We've not really done any pre-preparation either.
[01:11:30.653 --> 01:11:33.274]  I know he's sent me Facebook and Twitter deals over the years.
[01:11:33.294 --> 01:11:34.135]  He's talked to Biggs.
[01:11:34.155 --> 01:11:35.015]  He likes Biggs a lot.
[01:11:35.936 --> 01:11:36.536]  They've talked.
[01:11:37.557 --> 01:11:43.160]  And this was going to be in a couple other big publications, but at the end of the day, Danny said he always wanted Alex Jones to put this out.
[01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:43.941]  I didn't even ask for it.
[01:11:44.201 --> 01:11:44.561]  It's crazy.
[01:11:44.581 --> 01:11:46.622]  I didn't even ask to have the exclusive, and we just got it.
[01:11:46.643 --> 01:11:49.044]  Because I guess Danny's followed the show some over the years.
[01:11:49.945 --> 01:11:55.268]  So, that's what this comes down to, is everything the Clintons tell you is a lie.
[01:11:55.987 --> 01:11:57.988]  And we've got big news articles out in the Daily Mail.
[01:11:58.348 --> 01:12:00.229]  Are these the Clintons' secret grandkids?
[01:12:00.249 --> 01:12:11.613]  Their father, the man who claims he's Bill Clinton's love child, says his prostitute mother slept with the former Arkansas governor 13 times and received $700 bills every month delivered by a state trooper.
[01:12:11.633 --> 01:12:15.074]  I remember that back in the 90s, covering it.
[01:12:15.654 --> 01:12:22.377]  All I know is I got beat up in a parking lot saying, shut up about the Clintons, and then lost my job after I had people on about it.
[01:12:24.232 --> 01:12:26.134]  And I never knew exactly what it was with the Clintons.
[01:12:27.094 --> 01:12:27.695]  They wouldn't say it.
[01:12:27.715 --> 01:12:29.176]  They just said, stop talking about the Clintons.
[01:12:29.236 --> 01:12:32.038]  I kept getting death threats on my cell phone, death threats at my office phone.
[01:12:32.518 --> 01:12:35.740]  One day I'm on the office phone, we're gonna kill you outside, you don't show up at the Clintons.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:36.801]  I'm like, oh, go to hell.
[01:12:37.241 --> 01:12:39.823]  I walk outside, they walk around my car, and they go, we told you.
[01:12:39.843 --> 01:12:41.664]  Boom, broke my nose.
[01:12:43.425 --> 01:12:45.227]  I was like, oh, wow, you really mean business.
[01:12:45.947 --> 01:12:48.289]  Of course, old crocodile brain shifted into gear and
[01:12:51.903 --> 01:12:57.085]  Yeah, I'm not the toughest guy around, but four guys attacking in a parking lot, I beat the living hell out of them.
[01:12:57.485 --> 01:13:01.226]  They were barely getting in their Astro Van when I was done with them, but that's the side, I'm not trying to act tough.
[01:13:02.266 --> 01:13:05.868]  I'm not tough unless four guys are trying to kill me in a parking lot, I beat the living hell out of them.
[01:13:07.088 --> 01:13:10.249]  But, this is the type of stuff I've dealt with in my life.
[01:13:10.269 --> 01:13:12.690]  I mean, I got hit too, but it shouldn't even hurt me.
[01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:16.091]  Blood spurting out there, big deal, I'm about to tear your face off.
[01:13:16.711 --> 01:13:18.432]  Alright, I'm flashing back to it, I apologize.
[01:13:21.744 --> 01:13:30.751]  I'm not into violence, but when somebody attacks you and breaks your nose, and you punch them and their nose rips off their face, I mean, I mean, the cartilage came out, nose is like hanging, it's just like victory.
[01:13:30.811 --> 01:13:32.392]  They hit the ground, boom!
[01:13:32.412 --> 01:13:34.954]  It's like, I'm standing, blood's spraying, let's go!
[01:13:34.974 --> 01:13:36.295]  Ha ha ha!
[01:13:36.855 --> 01:13:38.817]  Just like we do in the Info War, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:38.837 --> 01:13:39.557]  We're not bragging.
[01:13:39.977 --> 01:13:41.619]  It's no brag if it's fact.
[01:13:42.756 --> 01:13:43.357]  Alright, excuse me.
[01:13:43.637 --> 01:13:45.298]  See, I gotta get hyped up to do this, though.
[01:13:45.338 --> 01:13:46.019]  This isn't fun.
[01:13:46.519 --> 01:13:54.246]  When I see some new video of Hillary confronted by Bill Clinton's a rapist, and it's all over the news, and the President attacks me yesterday, you know, I'm doing my duty.
[01:13:55.387 --> 01:14:06.637]  And it's scary, it's dangerous, and so my animal instinct kicks in and starts liking it, just because I guess that's the comforter for doing this type of stuff, but I apologize for being such an animal.
[01:14:07.961 --> 01:14:09.202]  But that's the stuff that gets me through.
[01:14:10.143 --> 01:14:11.884]  That's why God made me to be a crazy animal.
[01:14:12.604 --> 01:14:14.826]  I mean, I've got intellectual tools.
[01:14:15.506 --> 01:14:16.047]  Some of the best.
[01:14:16.467 --> 01:14:18.068]  But I am, at the end of the day, a crazy caveman.
[01:14:18.949 --> 01:14:21.831]  And I feel good putting Danny Williams on the air.
[01:14:21.851 --> 01:14:23.752]  I feel good exposing these people.
[01:14:24.232 --> 01:14:28.235]  I feel good standing up for the Christians, the 200,000-plus murdered in Syria alone.
[01:14:29.256 --> 01:14:30.277]  And the country was 20% Christian.
[01:14:34.773 --> 01:14:38.999]  Obama gets up and I want to find that clip where he goes, people say we got to let Christians in.
[01:14:39.099 --> 01:14:39.640]  No, no, no.
[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:40.861]  We're going to be fair.
[01:14:40.881 --> 01:14:41.723]  We let everybody in.
[01:14:41.763 --> 01:14:44.466]  He laughs because he knows there's an embargo.
[01:14:44.506 --> 01:14:46.870]  They let 0.4 Christians in.
[01:14:47.691 --> 01:14:50.214]  For every couple thousand jihadis, they let 0.4 in.
[01:14:57.449 --> 01:14:57.969]  Think about that.
[01:14:58.670 --> 01:14:59.270]  Same thing in Europe.
[01:14:59.291 --> 01:15:00.251]  They're not letting the Christians out.
[01:15:00.271 --> 01:15:00.892]  They're murdering them.
[01:15:00.912 --> 01:15:03.094]  And you ask, why are they out to kill Christians?
[01:15:03.734 --> 01:15:11.020]  Because Hillary Clinton and Obama are public, and they're also in their emails, hating Christians, hating America, hating Jesus Christ.
[01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:26.433]  Because America, for all its evils and all its problems, was a Christian nation, was given providence by true Christians that even predated the official church, who were always there.
[01:15:27.881 --> 01:15:29.883]  And they believed they were going to build a new continent.
[01:15:34.929 --> 01:15:41.195]  Now the globalists have put out a bunch of false prophecies and false info saying America won't even exist during the Great Tribulation.
[01:15:41.856 --> 01:15:46.581]  So you don't understand America will be the decider of what happens in the Great Tribulation.
[01:15:46.922 --> 01:15:48.784]  They tell you it doesn't exist in Scripture.
[01:15:50.202 --> 01:15:55.467]  Because globalists have infiltrated the church, and then we know America will decide the future fate, because God gives us free will.
[01:15:55.487 --> 01:15:58.149]  But I'm not going to get into all that right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:00.491 --> 01:16:05.535]  The point you need to understand is, Bill Clinton and Hillary don't like being called demons.
[01:16:07.817 --> 01:16:08.638]  And I figured it out.
[01:16:08.718 --> 01:16:12.041]  They're all competing to be the Antichrist, and that's an insult.
[01:16:12.061 --> 01:16:13.282]  That's like calling them a dishwasher.
[01:16:14.163 --> 01:16:15.063]  So let me call you this.
[01:16:15.644 --> 01:16:16.545]  Antichrist spirits.
[01:16:17.551 --> 01:16:18.291]  Does that make you happier?
[01:16:18.371 --> 01:16:21.272]  You are aspiring to the Antichrist world government.
[01:16:22.613 --> 01:16:30.016]  You are openly establishing world government that's anti-human, anti-prosperity, that's genetically engineering and mutating all major species.
[01:16:31.076 --> 01:16:37.438]  You are the very archetype of the Bible's warning of he that comes to kill, steal and destroy and overthrow God's creation.
[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:44.061]  So I apologize for calling you demons.
[01:16:45.031 --> 01:16:49.814]  You're aspiring, empty souls, begging for Satan to enter you.
[01:16:50.834 --> 01:16:53.816]  If that's better, I apologize, you've been given your full title.
[01:16:56.097 --> 01:17:09.185]  Satan has a large closet with a lot of clothes hanging, a lot of empty souls, a lot of empty vessels, and you're all there clamoring to be fitted with his spirit.
[01:17:10.299 --> 01:17:13.603]  You're all there like Avatar, wanting him to jump into your body.
[01:17:13.803 --> 01:17:15.766]  And so I get why it made you so mad.
[01:17:15.866 --> 01:17:16.667]  I apologize.
[01:17:16.687 --> 01:17:17.468]  That's right.
[01:17:17.528 --> 01:17:18.569]  You're not demons.
[01:17:18.610 --> 01:17:20.071]  You wouldn't be controlled by a demon.
[01:17:21.124 --> 01:17:23.145]  You are aspiring to the Lucifer spirit.
[01:17:24.026 --> 01:17:25.867]  I got involved in your religion, I understand.
[01:17:26.748 --> 01:17:27.348]  What do I know?
[01:17:27.809 --> 01:17:30.891]  I apologize to you profusely, obviously.
[01:17:30.911 --> 01:17:32.012]  That's why you get so upset about it.
[01:17:32.472 --> 01:17:35.154]  Because believe me, it's not because it's discrediting, we're talking about it.
[01:17:35.454 --> 01:17:36.755]  They want to go, don't go there!
[01:17:36.915 --> 01:17:37.476]  Don't go there!
[01:17:37.656 --> 01:17:38.476]  Oh, that discredits them!
[01:17:38.656 --> 01:17:39.917]  Oh boy, Trump, don't go there!
[01:17:39.957 --> 01:17:42.099]  Because you know it will destroy you.
[01:17:42.859 --> 01:17:46.782]  You know we carry the intelligence that will take you down.
[01:17:46.842 --> 01:17:47.303]  You know it.
[01:17:50.325 --> 01:17:50.765]  You hate it.
[01:17:52.537 --> 01:18:01.760]  You can't stand against it as long as those of us that know the truth are willing to do anything legal and lawful to stand against you.
[01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:06.382]  As long as we set ourselves against you, set our wills against you, set our spirits against you.
[01:18:06.402 --> 01:18:07.662]  It's a spiritual war, folks.
[01:18:08.883 --> 01:18:11.584]  God will then back us up, but we have to go through the tribulation.
[01:18:12.564 --> 01:18:14.065]  And believe me, it is intense.
[01:18:14.185 --> 01:18:18.066]  But every day you wake up and you're only stronger after it.
[01:18:19.087 --> 01:18:20.167]  But the trial of fire
[01:18:24.423 --> 01:18:28.386]  I know why a lot of people don't want to be spiritual and love God, because when you love God, the enemy comes against you.
[01:18:28.566 --> 01:18:30.648]  And the trials are substantive.
[01:18:34.351 --> 01:18:41.136]  But for me, the trials are like coming up for air out of the ocean.
[01:18:43.177 --> 01:18:44.138]  It's the struggle of birth.
[01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:49.282]  And it's the birth of the fall of Satan.
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:51.981]  The final fault.
[01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:54.243]  Alright, I've already waxed poetic here today.
[01:18:54.263 --> 01:18:58.588]  I'm going to skip this network break because of the epic nature of the transmission we are engaged in here today.
[01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:01.010]  The WikiLeaks are out there.
[01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.711]  It's more of the same.
[01:19:01.791 --> 01:19:05.154]  Running the media, colluding, engaged in crime, selling U.S.
[01:19:05.194 --> 01:19:06.335]  secrets.
[01:19:06.636 --> 01:19:08.057]  One of these is like life in prison.
[01:19:08.578 --> 01:19:10.259]  Just total, absolute criminal activity.
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:13.262]  America's being shown the total evil of our government.
[01:19:13.883 --> 01:19:16.305]  It's been hijacked by criminals, before we're judged.
[01:19:16.486 --> 01:19:17.627]  And you cannot believe in God.
[01:19:17.667 --> 01:19:25.794]  The point is, humans, through group movements, manifest a style, a spirit.
[01:19:27.736 --> 01:19:35.343]  You've got classical architecture, you've got Victorian architecture, you've got classical American architecture, you've got cubism, you've got all this stuff.
[01:19:35.563 --> 01:19:39.467]  You know, it's the spirit of our age, and you have to decide which spirit you're with.
[01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:47.102]  And that's why I get into spiritualism, because they're so scared, because that's what they're obsessed with.
[01:19:47.162 --> 01:19:47.862]  It comes out in the news.
[01:19:48.102 --> 01:19:57.410]  The Clintons, Obama, all of them, Francois Mitterrand, Tony Blair, the current British Prime Minister, they're all completely obsessed with the occult.
[01:19:58.010 --> 01:19:59.431]  It's skull and bones, Bohemian Grove.
[01:19:59.631 --> 01:20:00.072]  And they laugh.
[01:20:00.552 --> 01:20:02.694]  Oh, Alex Jones is calling us out as the devil!
[01:20:03.715 --> 01:20:04.895]  Says we're under plagues!
[01:20:05.196 --> 01:20:06.437]  Says we're under flies!
[01:20:10.515 --> 01:20:10.935]  Oh God!
[01:20:11.796 --> 01:20:12.856]  Boy, keep doing that!
[01:20:12.936 --> 01:20:14.257]  You're going to make us win, Alex!
[01:20:17.359 --> 01:20:19.960]  Whatever you do, though, throw me in that briar patch.
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:25.983]  I got a lot of the clips here I want to play.
[01:20:27.144 --> 01:20:29.445]  Briefly, let me just fund this operation right now.
[01:20:33.047 --> 01:20:34.328]  You know, I'm just going to tell you.
[01:20:34.628 --> 01:20:38.230]  There are some good nutraceutical companies, supplement companies out there.
[01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:41.251]  And the ones that are good, we promote.
[01:20:41.411 --> 01:20:44.293]  Like, Yongevity has 500 products now.
[01:20:44.653 --> 01:20:45.454]  I can't speak for them all.
[01:20:45.494 --> 01:20:46.414]  They have a very high standard.
[01:20:46.815 --> 01:20:50.177]  I know over 100 of their products that I've vetted and used and sell are amazing.
[01:20:50.197 --> 01:20:53.999]  Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Polymers Plus, they're excellent.
[01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:56.341]  That's InfoWarsTeam.com.
[01:20:56.361 --> 01:20:57.101]  You can buy them there.
[01:20:57.502 --> 01:20:59.023]  Get a discount when you sign up as a distributor.
[01:20:59.043 --> 01:21:00.584]  Get free shipping when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:21:00.644 --> 01:21:04.266]  If you want to support the broadcasting of Yongevity products, it's InfoWarsTeam.com.
[01:21:04.546 --> 01:21:06.808]  And there's a toll-free number there to order via the phone as well.
[01:21:09.141 --> 01:21:12.423]  But I've developed with top scientists, top firms, top companies.
[01:21:12.443 --> 01:21:20.128]  A lot of these top, I mean, top organic producers in the world, they go, we'll work with you, we love you, but we don't want to be targeted.
[01:21:20.148 --> 01:21:24.071]  So don't, don't say where you get the stuff made or where it gets manufactured.
[01:21:24.151 --> 01:21:26.272]  Dr. Groot makes about 45% of our products.
[01:21:26.292 --> 01:21:30.535]  The others are made by the other two big organic top rated companies, because I know I'm a political target.
[01:21:30.555 --> 01:21:33.517]  Plus I want to sell high quality stuff to have you buy it again at a low price.
[01:21:33.657 --> 01:21:34.518]  It's just free market.
[01:21:36.854 --> 01:21:41.815]  But the average supplement company has 5 to 7 times markup.
[01:21:41.855 --> 01:21:44.416]  Let's say there's $5 counting the cost of the bottle and the product.
[01:21:44.796 --> 01:21:45.716]  They sell it for $30, $40.
[01:21:46.436 --> 01:21:50.877]  If we're selling something for $100, there's like $50 in product in it.
[01:21:51.117 --> 01:21:56.278]  If we're selling something for $19.95, there's $10 of product in it.
[01:21:58.599 --> 01:22:00.999]  And people go, why don't you just sell a bottle of melatonin for $19.95?
[01:22:01.039 --> 01:22:01.899]  That's industry standard.
[01:22:01.919 --> 01:22:04.640]  You should have a prettier bottle and better marketing.
[01:22:05.936 --> 01:22:06.216]  I don't know.
[01:22:29.889 --> 01:22:31.050]  My cylinders just keep on going.
[01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:32.591]  I can't actually handle it.
[01:22:32.972 --> 01:22:37.055]  I take this, and, you know, one, it helps you sleep good, two, knocks your butt out.
[01:22:37.876 --> 01:22:39.537]  Takes about an hour, knock your ass out.
[01:22:40.758 --> 01:22:41.519]  And it's got it all.
[01:22:41.579 --> 01:22:44.041]  The hops, flour, the lemon balm, it's got it all.
[01:22:44.861 --> 01:22:49.165]  And it's got it all in good dosages, and it's organic, and it'll, it's a game changer.
[01:22:49.185 --> 01:22:50.726]  So it's a great deal at $19.95.
[01:22:52.428 --> 01:22:53.188]  Well, guess what?
[01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:54.229]  It's 25% off right now.
[01:22:54.309 --> 01:22:54.549]  It's $15.
[01:22:54.749 --> 01:22:58.513]  And that $5 we make on this helps fund our operation.
[01:22:59.278 --> 01:23:05.543]  The Hillary for Prison shirts are almost out of stock and we're not going to make any more, even though it's viral and out there and helps fund the operation.
[01:23:05.563 --> 01:23:07.244]  You want to get that final edition of it, it's there.
[01:23:07.485 --> 01:23:09.246]  We have a limited edition shirt made in America.
[01:23:09.846 --> 01:23:16.432]  The Gatsby snake taking Hillary to the mat, defeating her lies, and that's the lock her up, don't tread on me shirt.
[01:23:18.058 --> 01:23:20.020]  InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site.
[01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:22.123]  InfoWarsLife.com is a sub area.
[01:23:22.784 --> 01:23:27.249]  And you can also call 888-253-3139, ask any questions.
[01:23:28.230 --> 01:23:29.392]  I'm a 23% off on DNA Force.
[01:23:29.412 --> 01:23:29.912]  That will end today.
[01:23:29.952 --> 01:23:30.813]  I would send it one day.
[01:23:31.721 --> 01:23:37.363]  And I'll be quite frank, a lot of times, just because I forget to take it down off the website today, I just thought, hey, they tend to love it when we extend it one day.
[01:23:37.403 --> 01:23:40.283]  For some reason, when we get more funds then, that's what makes you buy it.
[01:23:40.303 --> 01:23:43.164]  Fine, I need money for all this operation and what we deal with.
[01:23:43.204 --> 01:23:44.405]  I mean, can you imagine what it's like?
[01:23:44.425 --> 01:23:46.085]  I'm not the type of bitch who complains.
[01:23:46.105 --> 01:23:48.706]  Quite frankly, I enjoy the enemy attacking me.
[01:23:48.746 --> 01:23:51.847]  It's not sadomasochistic, or masochistic, I guess is the word.
[01:23:52.967 --> 01:23:54.908]  It's that, just, I know you're trying to stop me.
[01:23:54.988 --> 01:23:55.708]  I know I'm right.
[01:23:56.548 --> 01:24:04.479]  If I'm out of energy at 10 o'clock at night, I've been working 20-something hours, and I see some crime The Globalist committed, it's like all of a sudden I just stand up and I've got five more hours of energy.
[01:24:07.261 --> 01:24:15.404]  The point is we need the funds, we need the prayers, we need to have one more or four or five more reporters and writers, and a few more editors and crew members, because we're overstressed right now.
[01:24:15.424 --> 01:24:24.326]  And I'm not complaining, but we've been working 18 hours a day, at least five, six days a week in the last couple months, and we'd do a better job if we had a second string.
[01:24:24.627 --> 01:24:25.947]  There really isn't a second string here.
[01:24:26.207 --> 01:24:32.169]  I got a bunch of stars that love freedom and are fighting hard, that are good people, that bleed red blood.
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:37.062]  I want to say every race, color, and creed, we're all just red-blooded.
[01:24:37.082 --> 01:24:38.664]  We're not blue-blooded globalists.
[01:24:38.944 --> 01:24:40.305]  We're a bunch of cold-blooded bastards.
[01:24:40.345 --> 01:24:41.065]  And we want freedom.
[01:24:41.325 --> 01:24:42.046]  We're dedicated.
[01:24:42.566 --> 01:24:43.607]  And we're having an effect.
[01:24:43.667 --> 01:24:45.388]  And we're interfacing with you.
[01:24:46.149 --> 01:24:47.510]  Just breaking down the basic facts.
[01:24:47.530 --> 01:24:49.371]  I want to salute you and thank you for your support.
[01:24:50.632 --> 01:24:55.696]  But obviously, flying all these guests in and doing all this and covering all this information is expensive.
[01:24:56.136 --> 01:24:58.138]  Now, I know I've confused the crew.
[01:24:58.158 --> 01:25:00.459]  I said, get ready for the eclipse of
[01:25:01.553 --> 01:25:01.813]  Trump.
[01:25:02.054 --> 01:25:03.816]  But first, let's play CNN Panelist.
[01:25:04.156 --> 01:25:06.720]  Bill Clinton rape allegations are effing ridiculous, dude.
[01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:08.462]  This is CNN Panelist.
[01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:19.805]  So CNN panelists dismiss Bill Clinton's documented history of sexual abuse against women as effing ridiculous, dude, because they've been ordered to do this and act all angry by the head of it.
[01:25:20.245 --> 01:25:29.589]  On broadcast of Erin Burnett, as the networks continue to cover for the Clintons while devouring vast swaths of airtime, Trump locker room banter.
[01:25:29.929 --> 01:25:37.333]  They want to say he's this big rapist who tried to rape a woman by saying, women jump on you, they let you grab them, to rape when Bill Clinton settled rape.
[01:25:37.853 --> 01:25:43.075]  The comments were made by liberal CNN commentator, Angela Ray, who went absolutely crazy.
[01:25:43.275 --> 01:25:47.676]  There's the other CNN reporter yelling the word, pussycat, without the cat on the end.
[01:25:48.197 --> 01:25:59.401]  Over and over and over again, they're meant to have this fake outburst because the head of CNN, Drudge has this exclusive, has ordered Danny Williams not to be covered.
[01:26:00.461 --> 01:26:02.622]  And I've talked to the reporters who've been told.
[01:26:03.424 --> 01:26:08.748]  You don't mention her health, you don't mention Bill Clinton and sexual assault stuff, and now you don't mention Danny Williams.
[01:26:09.048 --> 01:26:09.888]  That's Jeff Zucker.
[01:26:10.108 --> 01:26:26.339]  Well listen, Jeff, I know you and Clinton and Obama and everybody are working as hard as you can right now and doing everything you can like gangbusters right now to try to shut down the new alt-media that you want to call right-wing so the left gets into ending free speech.
[01:26:26.639 --> 01:26:28.381]  No, they want to end free speech worldwide of everybody.
[01:26:28.841 --> 01:26:29.641]  It's not working.
[01:26:29.682 --> 01:26:31.483]  Buddy, your average show has 100,000 viewers.
[01:26:31.723 --> 01:26:32.804]  Your biggest one's a million.
[01:26:33.764 --> 01:26:38.185]  Bro, I've got reporters that get 20 million views a week on their YouTubes.
[01:26:39.145 --> 01:26:40.685]  That isn't like every once in a while.
[01:26:41.766 --> 01:26:44.866]  The average is like, for watching, about 10 mil a week.
[01:26:47.267 --> 01:26:49.667]  I mean, what you gonna do when we come for you, bad boys?
[01:26:50.948 --> 01:26:51.908]  But they're still arrogant.
[01:26:52.108 --> 01:26:53.228]  They're showing their ivory towers.
[01:26:53.268 --> 01:26:54.888]  They still have secretaries kissing their asses.
[01:26:54.908 --> 01:26:58.829]  Except the secretary's gonna get us the intel out of the trash can and mail it to us.
[01:26:59.369 --> 01:26:59.569]  See?
[01:27:01.390 --> 01:27:01.870]  It's happening.
[01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:02.510]  It's going down.
[01:27:04.172 --> 01:27:06.414]  So let's play her, flip it out, here it is.
[01:27:21.143 --> 01:27:22.084]  Wait, no she didn't!
[01:27:22.264 --> 01:27:23.465]  How did she facilitate it?
[01:27:23.485 --> 01:27:35.655]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[01:27:47.225 --> 01:27:48.686]  I can't believe y'all.
[01:27:48.726 --> 01:27:53.591]  Meanwhile, Roger Stone is paying $2,500 of another victim and that's what you all are going to be proud of?
[01:27:53.631 --> 01:27:55.392]  Let me bring in Paris and Margaret.
[01:27:55.453 --> 01:27:56.654]  Victims, give me a break!
[01:27:57.134 --> 01:28:02.499]  Look, I mean, selective memory and choosing, I mean, there are depositions also against Donald Trump and accusing him of rape.
[01:28:02.779 --> 01:28:03.660]  Let's be very clear.
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:09.625]  So, regardless of whether it was dismissed, they're under oath and they're there, Kayleigh, so let's not be totally selective.
[01:28:09.665 --> 01:28:11.807]  Let's also just talk about the role of women here because you know what?
[01:28:12.147 --> 01:28:14.209]  Those women were great and they were fans of Donald Trump.
[01:28:14.249 --> 01:28:15.671]  They were also at a Donald Trump rally.
[01:28:15.871 --> 01:28:18.213]  This is no longer about women that are at Donald Trump's rallies.
[01:28:18.513 --> 01:28:20.995]  This is about independent women, Republican women.
[01:28:21.276 --> 01:28:22.497]  Guess what?
[01:28:22.897 --> 01:28:26.641]  70% of Republican women back in August were going to vote for Donald Trump.
[01:28:27.201 --> 01:28:31.726]  Mitt Romney's 93% of Republican women and John McCain's 89% of Republican women.
[01:28:31.926 --> 01:28:32.807]  That was August.
[01:28:33.007 --> 01:28:33.908]  That was not now.
[01:28:34.528 --> 01:28:38.452]  These numbers are bleeding for Donald Trump and so it doesn't matter what his fans say.
[01:28:38.792 --> 01:28:43.437]  It matters about these women in these swing states and where they're going and they're not going for Donald Trump.
[01:28:44.636 --> 01:28:45.657]  So that's all about your hype.
[01:28:45.917 --> 01:28:49.979]  Trump's losing, Trump's over, it's over for Trump, it's over for Trump, over and over again.
[01:28:50.019 --> 01:29:00.124]  This is how they push this narrative, freak out, but CNN is a husk of itself, trying to sell a con that Obamacare's free, you can keep your doctor, God thank God they're so stupid, over and over again.
[01:29:00.865 --> 01:29:09.650]  Speaking of who needs some Obamacare, here's Hillary and the new Trump ad that devastates her that I hope everybody gets at Infowars.com and shares.
[01:29:10.766 --> 01:29:14.527]  Our next president faces daunting challenges in a dangerous world.
[01:29:14.547 --> 01:29:16.288]  Iran promoting terrorism.
[01:29:16.588 --> 01:29:17.868]  North Korea threatening.
[01:29:18.169 --> 01:29:19.329]  ISIS on the rise.
[01:29:19.689 --> 01:29:21.790]  Libya and North Africa in chaos.
[01:29:22.150 --> 01:29:26.251]  Hillary Clinton failed every single time as Secretary of State.
[01:29:26.651 --> 01:29:28.092]  Now she wants to be president.
[01:29:28.352 --> 01:29:33.534]  Hillary Clinton doesn't have the fortitude, strength, or stamina to lead in our world.
[01:29:33.554 --> 01:29:35.254]  She failed as Secretary of State.
[01:29:35.434 --> 01:29:37.075]  Don't let her fail us again.
[01:29:37.575 --> 01:29:44.360]  Now, I want to correct the Trump campaign, and obviously they know this, but they wanted to make the Middle East a failed state in North Africa.
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:46.302]  They wanted to topple what's come out, Libya.
[01:29:46.322 --> 01:29:49.204]  Because Libya was stabilizing all of Africa and actually helping people.
[01:29:49.885 --> 01:29:50.905]  So that's why she did that.
[01:29:50.945 --> 01:29:51.966]  Hey, Danny Williams!
[01:29:52.927 --> 01:29:58.311]  Bill Clinton's son, reportedly, coming in studio here exclusively live when we come back.
[01:29:59.332 --> 01:30:00.212]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.713 --> 01:30:02.314]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.255 --> 01:30:05.917]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.282 --> 01:30:11.644]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:30:11.924 --> 01:30:13.226]  You can't survive without it.
[01:30:13.406 --> 01:30:14.307]  But where do you get it?
[01:30:14.607 --> 01:30:20.375]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.

[01:30:46.247 --> 01:30:47.448]  Stainless steel construction.

[01:30:48.768 --> 01:30:49.389]  Low maintenance.
[01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:51.490]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[01:31:09.978 --> 01:31:13.840]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.

[01:32:42.596 --> 01:32:46.160]  We've seen example after example of cable news networks attempting to deceive you.
[01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:55.048]  In short, the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces who are trying to sway public opinion in an unnatural direction that only serves establishment agendas.
[01:32:55.289 --> 01:33:00.073]  But InfoWars Live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.

[01:33:14.764 --> 01:33:16.985]  It's Wednesday, October 12th, 2016.
[01:33:18.806 --> 01:33:22.048]  Only 26 days left in the final countdown.
[01:33:22.809 --> 01:33:24.009]  Election 2016.
[01:33:25.390 --> 01:33:26.951]  Americanism vs. Globalism.
[01:33:28.092 --> 01:33:32.855]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, broadcasting from Austin, Texas, worldwide.
[01:33:37.921 --> 01:33:50.088]  While the media distracted you with an 11-year-old tape of Donald Trump's locker room banter, WikiLeaks dropped bombshell after bombshell, and the Clinton mouthpiece media have barely even reported on it.
[01:33:50.188 --> 01:34:04.115]  In one email sent by Hillary surrogate Bill Ivey to Clinton campaign manager John Podesta, Ivey brags about how the left has sought to maintain political power by producing, quote, an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[01:34:04.175 --> 01:34:06.500]  This is beyond arrogant elitism.
[01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:08.744]  It sounds like something out of They Live.
[01:34:09.004 --> 01:34:15.697]  The gains have been substantial, both for ourselves and for you, the human power elite.
[01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:25.402]  We've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics, and in general, conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[01:34:25.442 --> 01:34:26.202]  Conspire.
[01:34:26.922 --> 01:34:31.343]  Conspire to produce an uninformed mass who will just do as they're told.
[01:34:31.483 --> 01:34:35.464]  The unawareness remains strong, but compliance is obviously fading rapidly.
[01:34:35.764 --> 01:34:41.665]  This problem demands some serious, serious thinking, and not just poll-driven, demographically-inspired messaging.
[01:34:41.705 --> 01:34:42.325]  To emphasize,
[01:34:42.805 --> 01:34:53.412]  Ivy admits that the left has conspired to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry, but that they're not as easy to manipulate anymore, and that this is a problem.
[01:34:53.472 --> 01:34:59.856]  He characterizes unawareness amongst the public as a positive thing for the Clinton campaign.
[01:34:59.896 --> 01:35:03.858]  So we're supposed to be outraged about Trump's locker room banter from 2005?
[01:35:05.319 --> 01:35:15.025]  Yet here we have a Clinton surrogate calling the entire population of America dumb and conspiring with the Clinton campaign to keep it that way.
[01:35:15.066 --> 01:35:16.927]  And there's no outrage whatsoever.
[01:35:17.027 --> 01:35:19.108]  There's not even any media coverage of it.
[01:35:19.548 --> 01:35:21.090]  Absolutely nothing.
[01:35:21.270 --> 01:35:30.396]  But are you really surprised given what the other WikiLeaks emails reveal about the level of collusion between the copped media and Team Hillary?
[01:35:30.516 --> 01:35:35.259]  They talk about their friendlies in the media who will blithely regurgitate their talking points.
[01:35:35.599 --> 01:35:44.905]  Reporters like CNBC's John Harwood emailing the Clinton campaign begging to be patted on the head like an obedient dog for lavishing praise on Hillary.
[01:35:44.985 --> 01:35:51.509]  The New York Times asking the Clinton campaign for permission to use quotes from their own interview with Hillary.
[01:35:51.569 --> 01:35:56.232]  The Boston Globe colluding with her campaign to give her quote a big present.
[01:35:56.392 --> 01:35:59.674]  This level of cronyism and corruption is staggering.
[01:36:00.074 --> 01:36:05.956]  But it explains why much of the media refuses to even cover the WikiLeaks releases.
[01:36:05.996 --> 01:36:13.378]  Things like Hillary openly admitting that her so-called allies, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, are funding and supporting ISIS.
[01:36:13.658 --> 01:36:17.580]  Oh, but Trump said the word posse in 2005, so I guess that's more important.
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:24.382]  Confirmation that Hillary deliberately and criminally deleted certain emails to hide evidence of her wrongdoing.
[01:36:24.502 --> 01:36:29.127]  Moles inside Bernie Sanders' campaign who betrayed his strategy to tip off Hillary.
[01:36:29.167 --> 01:36:34.793]  Bill Clinton's behaviour pushing a female Clinton Foundation staffer to near suicide.
[01:36:34.993 --> 01:36:41.800]  Insiders within Hillary's campaign petrified about the damage posed by Bill Clinton's sexual predatory past.
[01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:44.883]  Oh, but you didn't hear about any of this on CNN.
[01:36:44.923 --> 01:36:48.346]  But you did hear Donald Trump say the word pussy in 2005.
[01:36:48.926 --> 01:36:52.249]  And to the media, that's what matters.
[01:36:52.369 --> 01:36:55.392]  And they wonder why their readership is collapsing.
[01:36:55.912 --> 01:37:03.719]  They wonder why 94% of the American people no longer trust a thing they say.
[01:37:19.127 --> 01:37:25.349]  I mean, she is an abject, psychopathic demon from hell that as soon as she gets into power is going to try to destroy the planet.
[01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:28.951]  She's warped like a demon, as you know, with Secretary of State.
[01:37:29.311 --> 01:37:31.892]  We came, we saw, he died.
[01:37:34.133 --> 01:37:36.654]  What difference, at this point, does it make?
[01:37:37.094 --> 01:37:47.758]  And there's only one candidate in this race who understands that democracy in a big, diverse country doesn't work if you constantly demonize each other, demonize each other.
[01:37:48.499 --> 01:37:53.423]  You could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.
[01:37:53.883 --> 01:37:55.425]  And I mean that literally, by the way.
[01:37:55.525 --> 01:38:04.372]  I was reading the other day, there's a guy on the radio who apparently, Trump's on his show frequently, he said, me and Hillary are demons.
[01:38:04.952 --> 01:38:05.713]  I'm telling you.
[01:38:08.595 --> 01:38:09.436]  She is a demon.
[01:38:11.818 --> 01:38:12.738]  This is biblical.
[01:38:12.798 --> 01:38:14.660]  She's going to launch a nuclear war.
[01:38:16.471 --> 01:38:17.031]  Said we.
[01:38:17.211 --> 01:38:18.212]  Smell like sulfur.
[01:38:18.532 --> 01:38:28.498]  Ain't that something?
[01:38:28.578 --> 01:38:34.101]  Now... I mean... Come on, people!
[01:38:37.367 --> 01:38:39.648]  You can't wash that evil off of Hillary.
[01:38:39.688 --> 01:38:45.150]  I'm not kidding, people say... They say... Folks, I've been told this by high-up folks.
[01:38:45.190 --> 01:38:48.432]  They say, listen, Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[01:38:48.452 --> 01:38:53.173]  I never said this because the media will go crazy with it, but I've talked to people that are in protective details.
[01:38:54.174 --> 01:38:55.354]  I mean, they're scared of her.
[01:38:55.374 --> 01:38:58.916]  And they say, listen, she's a freaking demon and she stinks.
[01:38:59.016 --> 01:38:59.656]  And so does Obama.
[01:38:59.696 --> 01:39:00.316]  And I go, like, what?
[01:39:00.476 --> 01:39:01.697]  Sulfur.
[01:39:02.137 --> 01:39:03.718]  They smell like hell.
[01:39:05.174 --> 01:39:08.559]  On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C.
[01:39:08.599 --> 01:39:13.626]  will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.
[01:39:13.646 --> 01:39:14.867]  It's about time.
[01:39:16.089 --> 01:39:21.376]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[01:39:33.556 --> 01:39:36.078]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:39:36.098 --> 01:39:44.245]  Danny Williams, now of Hot Springs, Arkansas, grew up in Little Rock, there at the Capitol, where his mother reportedly met the governor, Bill Clinton, is here with us.
[01:39:44.285 --> 01:39:51.230]  I remember interviewing your aunt back in the late 1990s, church lady, many years, hard worker, great record.
[01:39:51.591 --> 01:39:54.673]  You yourself got three children, no record, hard-working guy.
[01:39:55.354 --> 01:39:56.915]  I think your story is very, very incredible.
[01:39:57.335 --> 01:40:00.258]  We're going to walk through it, talk about it today, but thanks for coming to Austin, Texas, sir.
[01:40:02.237 --> 01:40:03.117]  Nice to have him here.
[01:40:03.137 --> 01:40:04.998]  We'll turn his mic on for folks.
[01:40:05.978 --> 01:40:07.799]  Danny, where to begin here?
[01:40:07.839 --> 01:40:18.382]  I mean, let's talk about you personally, where you're from, where you grew up, and then we'll start talking about the first time you ever heard from your mother that a certain person was your father.
[01:40:18.882 --> 01:40:19.642]  Right.
[01:40:20.183 --> 01:40:21.283]  My name is Danny Williams.
[01:40:21.383 --> 01:40:22.663]  I'm from Little Rock, Arkansas.
[01:40:23.284 --> 01:40:24.524]  I'm at age 30 right now.
[01:40:25.886 --> 01:40:34.009]  And all my life, I've been told that Bill Clinton was my father by my mom, my aunt, and other relatives that grew up with me.
[01:40:37.069 --> 01:40:39.530]  I mean, continue.
[01:40:39.550 --> 01:40:40.851]  I mean, I know you haven't been on TV before.
[01:40:40.871 --> 01:40:41.631]  You're live right now.
[01:40:41.671 --> 01:40:43.591]  Please keep going.
[01:40:43.692 --> 01:40:49.893]  But anyway, yes, I want to know the truth about Bill Clinton being my father.
[01:40:50.314 --> 01:40:51.634]  And that's all I ask is the truth.
[01:40:54.161 --> 01:40:55.223]  Do you think Bill Clinton is your father?
[01:40:55.444 --> 01:40:55.824]  Yes sir.
[01:40:58.429 --> 01:41:05.242]  You know, instead of just going through your whole history and we're going to do it and talk about it and play clips of Clinton being asked about you by the press and you won't respond.
[01:41:07.810 --> 01:41:09.411]  We're teleprompter free here.
[01:41:09.431 --> 01:41:11.253]  I'm just out of the gates.
[01:41:11.573 --> 01:41:12.794]  Bill Clinton will be watching this.
[01:41:12.834 --> 01:41:13.715]  This is undoubted.
[01:41:14.155 --> 01:41:16.977]  Obama responded to us yesterday, Hillary a few weeks ago.
[01:41:17.077 --> 01:41:17.898]  They watch every day.
[01:41:17.918 --> 01:41:22.121]  This shows in thousands of newspapers a day, all over every cable channel.
[01:41:22.982 --> 01:41:24.403]  We didn't do some pre-interview here.
[01:41:24.443 --> 01:41:25.904]  You just flew in at like 11 o'clock today.
[01:41:25.944 --> 01:41:26.945]  You just got here about an hour ago.
[01:41:27.425 --> 01:41:28.946]  Look at that camera right there, sir.
[01:41:29.006 --> 01:41:29.307]  Camera 4.
[01:41:31.425 --> 01:41:35.847]  Bill Clinton, William Jefferson Clinton will either be watching this live or he'll watch it later.
[01:41:36.167 --> 01:41:38.108]  What do you want to say to Bill Clinton, camera 4?
[01:41:38.468 --> 01:41:43.511]  I mean, I'd just like to ask and say to Bill Clinton that I want to meet you, I want to shake your hand.
[01:41:43.891 --> 01:41:46.012]  I want my kids to know their grandfathers.
[01:41:51.374 --> 01:41:58.858]  And I'd like to just, you know, I'd like to just meet them, get to know them, you know, and I mean,
[01:42:01.167 --> 01:42:04.231]  I never had a father in my life, so, you know, it's hard.
[01:42:04.251 --> 01:42:06.393]  It's difficult in explaining it, you know.
[01:42:06.413 --> 01:42:07.455]  It's okay.
[01:42:07.495 --> 01:42:07.855]  Go with it.
[01:42:07.875 --> 01:42:08.296]  It's alright.
[01:42:08.596 --> 01:42:09.477]  I've talked to you in private.
[01:42:09.497 --> 01:42:16.746]  I understand coming from the middle of Arkansas to now being with the top link on Drudge and you see yourself right there and all over the world.
[01:42:16.766 --> 01:42:18.108]  But just tell it like it is.
[01:42:19.509 --> 01:42:23.150]  You believe Bill Clinton is your father, your mother always told you that, he sent you money, all the rest of it.
[01:42:23.410 --> 01:42:23.650]  Right.
[01:42:23.710 --> 01:42:26.651]  He won't respond to it, so Bill Clinton and Hillary are watching right now.
[01:42:26.671 --> 01:42:26.992]  Right.
[01:42:27.012 --> 01:42:32.853]  Talk about an epic story, the videos on your Facebook, it's on Infowars, trying to go over the fence at the Governor's Mansion.
[01:42:33.274 --> 01:42:34.414]  You wanted to meet your daddy?
[01:42:34.694 --> 01:42:36.555]  I mean, you're meeting him right now, digitally.
[01:42:36.755 --> 01:42:37.035]  Right.
[01:42:37.315 --> 01:42:39.376]  Right there, my friend, what do you want to say?
[01:42:39.396 --> 01:42:40.316]  I want to, I'd like to say...
[01:42:43.419 --> 01:42:44.239]  My name is Danny Wade.
[01:42:44.279 --> 01:42:50.661]  I'd like to just say, you know, I want to be able to experience that having a father in your life, you know what I'm saying?
[01:42:50.941 --> 01:42:52.561]  And now I got kids of my own.
[01:42:52.841 --> 01:42:54.461]  I want my kids to know their grandfather.
[01:42:54.481 --> 01:42:55.882]  They ask me all the time, who's your dad?
[01:42:56.042 --> 01:42:56.342]  You know?
[01:42:56.962 --> 01:43:05.804]  So, I mean, it's my chance now and get my story out and let the world know who I am and who's my father and, you know, the truth about everything.
[01:43:07.844 --> 01:43:12.486]  Well, the Daily Mail has the headline, Bill Clinton's grandkids, you know, will he look into meeting with them?
[01:43:14.107 --> 01:43:16.648]  We'll go back to that in a moment, but just starting at the beginning.
[01:43:16.948 --> 01:43:17.228]  Okay.
[01:43:17.708 --> 01:43:21.190]  Break down how you grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas.
[01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:22.710]  You're now in Hot Springs.
[01:43:23.310 --> 01:43:25.651]  What it was like and when you first began to hear this.
[01:43:26.532 --> 01:43:26.852]  Okay.
[01:43:27.952 --> 01:43:30.634]  Well, growing up in Arkansas, it was like everybody knew.
[01:43:30.774 --> 01:43:33.215]  Everybody, you know, they'd say, that's Bill Clinton's son.
[01:43:33.455 --> 01:43:36.096]  And everywhere I go, you know,
[01:43:37.512 --> 01:43:40.194]  So, I mean, growing up, it was rough growing up.
[01:43:40.355 --> 01:43:42.416]  I mean, we barely was making it.
[01:43:42.456 --> 01:43:43.637]  We was broke.
[01:43:44.858 --> 01:43:51.644]  I mean, my aunt, she worked two jobs trying to raise us, me and my little brothers and sisters.
[01:43:52.385 --> 01:44:02.433]  I mean, everybody in Arkansas at the time I was coming up knew about me being his son, preachers and all.
[01:44:04.969 --> 01:44:15.853]  I just want to be able to just, you know, have the chance and get myself out and explaining who I am and why am I facing the weather today to reach my father.
[01:44:18.294 --> 01:44:27.697]  I noticed in the video interview we did that we aired, you talked about wanting to meet him because you heard he was sick in your own words.
[01:44:27.977 --> 01:44:33.599]  Right, I heard he has Perkins, if I'm not mistaken, heart problems and they, you know,
[01:44:34.807 --> 01:44:50.895]  People ain't living long these days, so ain't no telling when he may pass, you know, so now it's, I mean, now it's my chance to be able to get my story out and get it heard to me, my father, before that happened, you know, before he, something tragic happened to him.
[01:44:51.457 --> 01:44:55.920]  Well, we can go to Joel Gilbert's website or WorldNetDaily and show some of the articles while you're speaking.
[01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:56.160]  Right.
[01:44:56.340 --> 01:45:00.083]  You next to Bill Clinton for TV viewers watching.
[01:45:00.103 --> 01:45:01.423]  I mean, how much you look like him.
[01:45:01.744 --> 01:45:05.366]  But I remember back at the time that
[01:45:07.389 --> 01:45:14.672]  When I first had your aunt on, this has got to be 20 years ago almost, 19 years ago, that this is what I was getting from the state police and others.
[01:45:14.732 --> 01:45:17.433]  So, let's get into what you talk about in the video.
[01:45:17.773 --> 01:45:24.756]  When you first start hearing this, before you heard about it, your mother tried to get you in the scene with the Governor's Mansion, then later you tried to get on the property when you're older.
[01:45:25.416 --> 01:45:26.957]  Let's go through this, Danny.
[01:45:27.277 --> 01:45:29.098]  Okay, well, it was my aunt, actually.
[01:45:29.118 --> 01:45:31.979]  My mom had lost custody of us.
[01:45:34.414 --> 01:45:34.995]  Yeah, right.
[01:45:35.055 --> 01:45:36.935]  My aunt had custody of him, my aunt Lucille.
[01:45:37.315 --> 01:45:41.817]  So one day she was like, you know, she took me down to the government mansion.
[01:45:42.277 --> 01:45:46.358]  And she was like, you know, we're going to let him know that you're his son.
[01:45:46.838 --> 01:45:49.479]  So we went down there and she had to sneak through the gates.
[01:45:50.339 --> 01:45:53.600]  And she went up to the door and the butler answered the door.
[01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:56.501]  And she asked for Hillary.
[01:45:57.222 --> 01:46:00.803]  And the door was slammed in her face, and we were told to get off the property.
[01:46:00.883 --> 01:46:07.946]  So she took off running, snatched me by one arm, and all I could remember was my arm hurting, and she snatched me to jump over the fence.
[01:46:08.947 --> 01:46:12.088]  And she asked me all the time, do you remember me taking you to the government mansion?
[01:46:12.108 --> 01:46:13.128]  I said, yeah, I remember.
[01:46:13.148 --> 01:46:15.689]  I remember you snatching my arm and taking off running.
[01:46:16.109 --> 01:46:17.490]  So, you know.
[01:46:18.775 --> 01:46:20.976]  I mean, it's never went away.
[01:46:21.076 --> 01:46:26.537]  I mean, he has delivered Christmas gifts to my home by Arkansas State Troopers.
[01:46:27.097 --> 01:46:29.698]  He has paid my mom under the table.
[01:46:30.238 --> 01:46:36.180]  Up until the time he made president in 1993, he stopped doing anything for us.
[01:46:36.220 --> 01:46:39.081]  So I believe in my heart that he tried to be in my life.
[01:46:42.768 --> 01:46:47.250]  Well, this is a narrative that comes out from everybody that Hillary runs the show, Hillary's the boss.
[01:46:47.570 --> 01:46:47.750]  Right.
[01:46:47.831 --> 01:46:51.312]  She actually manages him and uses his issues as a control mechanism.
[01:46:51.592 --> 01:46:55.034]  From your research, who is it that kept you away from the man you believe to be your father?
[01:46:55.294 --> 01:46:55.634]  Correct.
[01:46:55.674 --> 01:46:57.675]  I think Hillary is the one that kept me away.
[01:46:57.695 --> 01:47:02.938]  I mean, as a married couple, your decisions are one.
[01:47:03.218 --> 01:47:10.401]  So, I'm sure she know of me and I'm sure she had parts in with the
[01:47:12.057 --> 01:47:20.322]  All the publicity, all the stories in the press that, you know, falsely reports all we have taken the DNA, all of that is false, you know.
[01:47:21.763 --> 01:47:25.806]  So, you know, I really do think she she has played a part in.
[01:47:27.427 --> 01:47:29.568]  And as they call banishing me, you know.
[01:47:29.588 --> 01:47:29.648]  Now.
[01:47:34.912 --> 01:47:39.694]  I know it's hard for you to talk about, but you've discussed mentally, psychologically, what this has done to you.
[01:47:39.734 --> 01:47:41.474]  I mean, go over the years, when you first started.
[01:47:41.494 --> 01:47:44.676]  How old were you when you first started learning about this, and then what did it do over the years?
[01:47:45.436 --> 01:47:48.417]  Okay, when I first started learning, I was probably about eight or nine.
[01:47:48.997 --> 01:47:55.079]  I was in school, and you know, my teachers, they would look at me, and they'd be whispering, you know, it's Bill Clinton's son.
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:59.621]  His mother's the one that claims she had a baby by Bill Clinton.
[01:47:59.641 --> 01:48:01.942]  And, you know, it's just difficult, you know, growing up.
[01:48:04.190 --> 01:48:06.391]  House to house, you know, not stable.
[01:48:06.612 --> 01:48:08.773]  It just, it became difficult my whole life.
[01:48:08.873 --> 01:48:20.460]  So, you know, I just thought about it, you know, I'm like, there's something true to it that after all these years, they still put out false reports.
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:25.744]  1999, 2000, the false DNA, you know, all these articles that they put out that's false about me.
[01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:32.553]  But the article that my mother gave in 93 is, you know, somebody bought rightful ownership to it.
[01:48:32.613 --> 01:48:34.874]  And, you know, it just it make you think so.
[01:48:34.894 --> 01:48:45.480]  Two, two, two years, almost two years ago, two years and a half ago, I started my Facebook page campaigning for me and Bill Clinton, Bill Clinton being my father.
[01:48:46.241 --> 01:48:48.384]  I wanted to know, and I've always wanted to know.
[01:48:48.424 --> 01:48:50.127]  I just never got any help.
[01:48:50.567 --> 01:48:53.031]  I reached out to lawyers and investigators.
[01:48:53.071 --> 01:48:54.773]  They would not look into my case.
[01:48:55.334 --> 01:48:55.794]  No one.
[01:48:55.914 --> 01:49:02.604]  So I started campaigning my own Facebook page and saying Bill Clinton, my father, and I'm trying to get my story out.
[01:49:03.686 --> 01:49:04.346]  Well, keep rolling.
[01:49:04.366 --> 01:49:05.707]  I love the fact now that you're relaxed.
[01:49:05.727 --> 01:49:06.747]  I can tell you're nervous.
[01:49:06.767 --> 01:49:07.368]  Who wouldn't be?
[01:49:08.028 --> 01:49:11.449]  The head of CNN, Jeff Zucker, it's all come out in WikiLeaks, too.
[01:49:11.469 --> 01:49:17.432]  They order him, don't talk about Bill Clinton's sex crimes, don't talk about Hillary's health, don't talk about illegitimate children, don't talk about it.
[01:49:19.687 --> 01:49:19.827]  I mean...
[01:49:42.970 --> 01:49:43.851]  I think a lot about it.
[01:49:43.891 --> 01:49:50.637]  Actually, I think, you know, as far as she stand up and saying, well, the kid, you know, kids going to be.
[01:49:51.658 --> 01:49:58.405]  We're going to make sure kids have the rightful, you know, taking care of them and rightful school, you know, and all this.
[01:49:59.286 --> 01:50:01.348]  I actually think that they are lies.
[01:50:01.368 --> 01:50:07.994]  And I think she's just using it to to make to be in office.
[01:50:12.116 --> 01:50:18.000]  And to be clear today, when I went there about an hour before he went on air, I said, listen, we've never really talked.
[01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:19.521]  We've talked over the phone a couple times.
[01:50:19.561 --> 01:50:20.241]  My crew has.
[01:50:20.761 --> 01:50:21.682]  You just flew in today.
[01:50:21.722 --> 01:50:23.023]  You've been talking to the bigs and stuff.
[01:50:23.583 --> 01:50:26.705]  I said, will you just please write notes on the questions you want me to ask?
[01:50:26.785 --> 01:50:27.866]  And he wrote those up.
[01:50:27.906 --> 01:50:28.747]  These are your thoughts.
[01:50:29.107 --> 01:50:30.448]  These are your questions.
[01:50:30.808 --> 01:50:35.351]  One thing that got brought up is Bill Clinton a couple weeks ago got asked about his son, reported son, Danny Williams.
[01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:38.482]  By a YouTuber called Charlie in the Box.
[01:50:38.542 --> 01:50:39.682]  I want to skip this network break.
[01:50:39.903 --> 01:50:40.143]  Right.
[01:50:40.163 --> 01:50:41.003]  This is so important.
[01:50:41.023 --> 01:50:47.648]  I want to play this since you mentioned this and just again go back to if you're really in the room with Bill Clinton because you are in the room with him.
[01:50:47.668 --> 01:50:49.870]  He will watch this undoubtedly.
[01:50:50.030 --> 01:50:50.370]  Yes, sir.
[01:50:50.490 --> 01:50:58.336]  I mean, you know, spill it out there because you need to talk directly to him because I've talked to Arkansas State Police back when I was being given these tips.
[01:50:59.097 --> 01:51:02.159]  Believe me, they didn't send people down here to get me fired and get my ass beat.
[01:51:02.299 --> 01:51:02.619]  Right.
[01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:04.020]  Because you weren't his
[01:51:05.185 --> 01:51:06.366]  You know, Warren is illegitimate son.
[01:51:06.526 --> 01:51:07.306]  They're concerned about this.
[01:51:07.326 --> 01:51:12.329]  I want to talk about your memories with Mama, and the money, and the presence, which humanizes Bill.
[01:51:12.489 --> 01:51:12.610]  Right.
[01:51:12.630 --> 01:51:13.810]  We're not just trying to demonize Hillary.
[01:51:13.850 --> 01:51:17.793]  She was the one, even 20 years ago, before I knew she'd run for President, they were saying, well, shut this down.
[01:51:17.813 --> 01:51:23.096]  So I want to talk about that with Danny Williams, the reported son of Bill Clinton.
[01:51:23.716 --> 01:51:32.682]  But let's go ahead and play this clip here of the protester asking Bill Clinton about, well, not approaching, he's there just at the gate.
[01:51:33.655 --> 01:51:38.279]  As Obama comes by, shaking hands with the Secret Service, saying, what about Danny Williams?
[01:51:38.299 --> 01:51:38.659]  Here it is.
[01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:41.161]  Thank you, Mr. Clinton.
[01:51:41.221 --> 01:51:44.483]  Mr. Clinton, would you like to make a comment to Danny Williams?
[01:51:45.384 --> 01:51:52.029]  Mr. Clinton, can you make a comment about Trump saying about rape allegations?
[01:51:52.049 --> 01:51:54.191]  Hey, I don't want to hear any of that.
[01:51:54.231 --> 01:51:54.771]  Knock it off.
[01:51:56.152 --> 01:51:58.476]  Can we get any comment about anything like that, please?
[01:51:58.657 --> 01:52:01.161]  Hey, this is a monumental event for us.
[01:52:01.181 --> 01:52:02.484]  We don't want to hear it.
[01:52:02.504 --> 01:52:08.455]  I know, but we got a lot of questions that aren't being answered from the American people.
[01:52:10.439 --> 01:52:11.800]  I mean, they acted like Danny.
[01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:13.000]  They knew what was going on.
[01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:15.781]  Bill looked like having a nice day when he looked at that camera.
[01:52:16.501 --> 01:52:22.083]  I don't want to dehumanize him because I know he's got a lot of problems, but he did deliver money to you for how many years?
[01:52:22.143 --> 01:52:22.904]  I mean, how many?
[01:52:23.284 --> 01:52:27.646]  All the way up until 93, he made presents to me.
[01:52:28.106 --> 01:52:32.487]  My mom received $700 and $100 bills in her mailbox every month.
[01:52:33.808 --> 01:52:35.929]  And the Christmas presents on Christmas.
[01:52:37.156 --> 01:52:37.436]  Yeah.
[01:53:01.718 --> 01:53:05.682]  It's not that, I mean- I mean, I know what my dad looks like, he looks like me a lot.
[01:53:05.782 --> 01:53:06.282]  Exactly.
[01:53:06.983 --> 01:53:07.383]  Exactly.
[01:53:07.744 --> 01:53:10.306]  So, I mean, I just, all I want is the truth out.
[01:53:10.726 --> 01:53:12.088]  That's all I'm reaching for, the truth.
[01:53:12.128 --> 01:53:13.609]  There's not no political scandal.
[01:53:13.629 --> 01:53:16.452]  I mean, I'm just here for the truth.
[01:53:18.717 --> 01:53:19.758]  I mean, here it is right here.
[01:53:19.778 --> 01:53:22.099]  Now, I don't know what's going on.
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:23.300]  I mean, we flew you in.
[01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:23.901]  I'm busy.
[01:53:23.941 --> 01:53:24.501]  You're busy.
[01:53:24.941 --> 01:53:26.102]  I'm not micromanaging stuff.
[01:53:26.222 --> 01:53:26.563]  Yes, sir.
[01:53:26.863 --> 01:53:31.966]  All of a sudden, I guess, during the break, last hour and a half you were here, you did an interview with the crew and they transcribed it.
[01:53:32.347 --> 01:53:34.948]  Bill Clinton's son tells Hillary, step aside.
[01:53:35.569 --> 01:53:37.230]  This just went up on Infowars.com.
[01:53:37.250 --> 01:53:39.372]  Did you write this before you got here or just today?
[01:53:39.392 --> 01:53:43.755]  Because I'll be honest, they just walked in and- No, I wrote it before I got here and I'm asking her to step aside.
[01:53:43.935 --> 01:53:48.338]  All I want is a sample of his DNA to prove who I am and my story is true today.
[01:53:49.175 --> 01:53:50.136]  We'll put that up on screen.
[01:53:50.196 --> 01:53:50.496]  Okay.
[01:53:50.516 --> 01:53:52.738]  Well, I mean, I'm telling you folks, he's running the show here today.
[01:53:53.359 --> 01:53:56.441]  Um, Danny, and again, why did you choose us to bring this out?
[01:53:56.461 --> 01:54:14.076]  Cause we, I mean, I choose, I mean, I, I choose y'all for one, I need the world to know that I'm trying to get as many as people I can to let me speak about on the truth of my story and, and why am I doing this today?
[01:54:14.596 --> 01:54:17.399]  I mean, I've been trying all my life to get this out.
[01:54:18.945 --> 01:54:20.926]  That's right, the media spends it like you just popped up now.
[01:54:21.126 --> 01:54:21.606]  Right, no.
[01:54:21.626 --> 01:54:23.287]  I was interviewing your aunt 20 years ago.
[01:54:23.307 --> 01:54:23.347]  No.
[01:54:23.888 --> 01:54:29.530]  There's been articles since 93, 99, 98, 95 when he ran for a second term.
[01:54:29.851 --> 01:54:32.852]  So, I mean, those articles when I was a kid.
[01:54:34.113 --> 01:54:39.095]  And now that I'm grown, they... And let's be clear, your mother said he was the only white man she was with.
[01:54:39.496 --> 01:54:40.116]  Right, correct.
[01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:43.341]  My mother, my mother explains to me all the time.
[01:54:43.401 --> 01:54:44.602]  Her story never changed.
[01:54:44.862 --> 01:54:46.263]  It's always consisted the same.
[01:54:46.303 --> 01:54:46.983]  How did it start?
[01:54:47.023 --> 01:54:47.904]  You're eight years old.
[01:54:47.924 --> 01:54:48.584]  What does mama tell you?
[01:54:49.505 --> 01:54:57.049]  My mama told me that she dated him and you know, she, she, she dated guys for money, you know, to, to afford to take care of us.
[01:54:57.650 --> 01:55:01.492]  So at the time my mother had two older sons besides me.
[01:55:02.932 --> 01:55:09.677]  So, she tell me, you know, how he pick her up, you know, she destroyed his mother's house, you know, everything she destroyed in 93.
[01:55:09.737 --> 01:55:11.879]  I've seen photos of your mother when she was young, very beautiful.
[01:55:12.119 --> 01:55:13.200]  Right, very beautiful.
[01:55:13.300 --> 01:55:18.124]  She's never been always, you know, as people think she is.
[01:55:19.122 --> 01:55:21.444]  Oh, she's a drug addict, she's this, she's that.
[01:55:21.504 --> 01:55:24.525]  No, she always done the best she could to take care of us.
[01:55:24.545 --> 01:55:25.866]  She's been down a long road.
[01:55:26.106 --> 01:55:26.447]  Right.
[01:55:27.507 --> 01:55:38.734]  And right now she's, at this point in her life right now, she's still alive and she's driven by guilt on how we was brought up and what she could have done better.
[01:55:38.754 --> 01:55:44.558]  And you know, and I feel that she's afraid to speak out public about this situation.
[01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:46.280]  And tell her why.
[01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:47.141]  I mean, tell us why.
[01:55:47.181 --> 01:55:47.921]  We know what Hillary did.
[01:55:47.941 --> 01:55:48.162]  Tell us.
[01:55:48.982 --> 01:55:51.003]  I mean, they tried to hush her up.
[01:55:51.464 --> 01:55:53.405]  My mom had been pushed out of a two-story window.
[01:55:54.325 --> 01:55:55.606]  She got metal plates in her foot.
[01:55:55.626 --> 01:55:57.607]  By the way, nobody's heard this, but there's been threats.
[01:55:57.627 --> 01:55:58.408]  That's why everybody's freaked.
[01:55:58.428 --> 01:55:59.628]  Go ahead and tell people what happened.
[01:55:59.789 --> 01:56:01.249]  I get threats today on Facebook.
[01:56:01.289 --> 01:56:02.390]  They tell me, oh, they cleansed it.
[01:56:02.410 --> 01:56:03.371]  Tell people what happened to your mother.
[01:56:03.391 --> 01:56:04.171]  Tell them what the police did.
[01:56:04.191 --> 01:56:05.452]  Tell them what the state police did.
[01:56:06.052 --> 01:56:07.893]  They're famous for breaking people's arms and legs.
[01:56:07.974 --> 01:56:08.254]  Right.
[01:56:08.314 --> 01:56:09.554]  I mean, Jennifer Flowers.
[01:56:09.574 --> 01:56:11.776]  I was told that she was pushed out of a two-story window.
[01:56:11.896 --> 01:56:13.397]  And this was told by my mom.
[01:56:13.717 --> 01:56:14.798]  She got a metal plate from her.
[01:56:15.985 --> 01:56:17.506]  Bottom of her toes up to her ankle.
[01:56:18.347 --> 01:56:23.251]  And I was told that, you know, people was trying to kill her because of her claim of her having a son by Bill Clinton.
[01:56:25.332 --> 01:56:28.014]  Now, bottom line, we're all just here in our lives here, so please continue.
[01:56:28.215 --> 01:56:28.675]  Talk to Bill.
[01:56:28.695 --> 01:56:30.937]  I mean, this is what she gets.
[01:56:30.957 --> 01:56:31.577]  I mean, tell him.
[01:56:31.757 --> 01:56:32.018]  Right.
[01:56:32.418 --> 01:56:39.383]  And today, Bill, all I want to do is to get the truth out behind who I am and that I am your son.
[01:56:40.304 --> 01:56:43.847]  And I would like for my kids, your grandkids, to meet you.
[01:56:47.068 --> 01:56:49.009]  I mean, it's more I can say right now.
[01:56:49.229 --> 01:56:51.230]  I mean, I'm really emotional.
[01:56:51.290 --> 01:56:51.950]  Say it, it's alright.
[01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:56.372]  I know you broke down crying today before and I know you've thought about suicide.
[01:56:56.392 --> 01:56:57.792]  Tell people to be honest.
[01:56:57.812 --> 01:57:01.954]  I have thought about suicide before because, I mean, you go through this, you know, people
[01:57:02.854 --> 01:57:03.995]  People don't believe you, you know?
[01:57:04.235 --> 01:57:06.056]  You go through this, you're trying to beat your story out.
[01:57:06.096 --> 01:57:07.637]  People are like, oh, he's just a scam.
[01:57:08.277 --> 01:57:09.458]  He's this, he's helping Trump.
[01:57:09.478 --> 01:57:10.298]  Trump never pay.
[01:57:10.538 --> 01:57:11.419]  I don't work for Trump.
[01:57:11.559 --> 01:57:12.359]  I work for myself.
[01:57:12.419 --> 01:57:15.361]  I've done this two years ago before she even started running.
[01:57:15.881 --> 01:57:17.982]  She supposed to run in 2008 and made president.
[01:57:18.062 --> 01:57:20.244]  I interviewed your aunt 19 years ago.
[01:57:20.264 --> 01:57:21.825]  That's nothing to do with Trump.
[01:57:22.125 --> 01:57:22.465]  Right.
[01:57:23.225 --> 01:57:28.588]  So, like I say, it's the truth on who I am and where I'm trying to go in my life.
[01:57:28.688 --> 01:57:29.629]  I know that
[01:57:31.058 --> 01:57:38.303]  With me getting my story out and helping my kids and raising, I raise my kids and I help raise my little sisters and brothers.
[01:57:38.964 --> 01:57:45.689]  I know that one day it is someone out there that might need my help and doesn't go through the same thing I went through in my life.
[01:57:46.169 --> 01:57:48.371]  So, no, it's a destiny for me to get my story out.
[01:57:48.391 --> 01:57:48.851]  No, it makes sense.
[01:57:48.871 --> 01:57:56.217]  I know you've talked about this privately, but if he behind the scenes just help out and be with the kids and recognize you, it's like you want to meet your dad.
[01:57:56.317 --> 01:57:58.759]  And then you've got grandkids, these grandkids are like,
[01:58:00.350 --> 01:58:03.013]  I mean, let me tell you, if I had black grandkids, I'd want to know them.
[01:58:03.413 --> 01:58:04.054]  Right, correct.
[01:58:04.154 --> 01:58:06.877]  I mean, I don't care what color they are, I love them.
[01:58:06.897 --> 01:58:08.458]  I had my first child at 16.
[01:58:08.538 --> 01:58:14.985]  I dropped out of school in 11th grade, working full-time in a donut shop to raise my child and my little sisters and brothers.
[01:58:15.885 --> 01:58:22.292]  So, like I said, it's been hard and rough for me, traveling this road, but I'll never give up and I will not give up.
[01:58:23.346 --> 01:58:26.588]  Until, you know, he step up and say, yes, I'm willing to give you a sample.
[01:58:26.628 --> 01:58:28.469]  I'm willing to put this behind us.
[01:58:28.849 --> 01:58:30.851]  So Bill Clinton give the sample and prove it wrong.
[01:58:30.871 --> 01:58:32.532]  The third party's watching.
[01:58:33.072 --> 01:58:33.292]  Right.
[01:58:34.633 --> 01:58:39.896]  He got into it, folks, but his mother got threatened by the state police and Hillary in person to put her in prison or kill her.
[01:58:40.296 --> 01:58:41.917]  Then she got thrown out a window a month later.
[01:58:42.798 --> 01:58:45.920]  And we've already been threatened over this interview today, just so you know.
[01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:49.282]  And when I had his ant on, I got beat up a week later.
[01:58:50.549 --> 01:58:52.354]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:53.837 --> 01:58:56.022]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:59.875 --> 01:59:06.040]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:59:06.420 --> 01:59:09.302]  Dr. Grip, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:59:09.642 --> 01:59:14.826]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:59:15.246 --> 01:59:21.230]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:59:21.371 --> 01:59:24.513]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:59:24.653 --> 01:59:26.094]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:59:26.314 --> 01:59:30.455]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:59:30.635 --> 01:59:33.496]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:59:33.576 --> 01:59:35.156]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:59:35.236 --> 01:59:38.417]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:59:38.717 --> 01:59:41.037]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:59:41.317 --> 01:59:42.277]  It's in powder form.
[01:59:42.377 --> 01:59:45.078]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:59:45.258 --> 01:59:46.258]  I take this.

[01:59:56.803 --> 01:59:58.704]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:17.216 --> 02:00:20.737]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:00:21.277 --> 02:00:30.240]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:34.181]  He made his living in cheap hotels.
[02:00:35.181 --> 02:00:38.042]  The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold.
[02:00:38.802 --> 02:00:41.863]  And so the story ends, we're told.
[02:00:42.663 --> 02:00:45.604]  You know, all I care about, I'm a very romantic person.
[02:00:46.934 --> 02:00:51.240]  Whether I'm 50 when I die or 100, when they stick me in that ground, everybody's proud of me.
[02:00:51.461 --> 02:00:54.125]  Everybody knows I stood up for the average person.
[02:00:54.746 --> 02:00:55.427]  I wasn't a coward.
[02:00:57.510 --> 02:00:59.112]  Denny Williams, I believe your story because...
[02:01:00.310 --> 02:01:27.168]  I remember, and I wanted to go check on it before I talked about it a few weeks ago, your aunt on the phone, and it was you or some other person, Danny be quiet, running around, you're like 10 years old, 7 years old, whatever it was, 8 years old, I don't remember, in like the late 90s, while she's on the phone just trying to talk about the fact that her sister had told her this happened and Bill Clinton did this and they were covering it up, and we know about Clinton, we know what he does, and they're so scared of this story,
[02:01:28.510 --> 02:01:30.531]  And now Drudge is also linked, and Forbes hasn't.
[02:01:30.831 --> 02:01:33.453]  Bill Clinton's son tells Hillary, step aside.
[02:01:33.833 --> 02:01:35.755]  Let's talk about this, but I want to give you the floor.
[02:01:35.795 --> 02:01:36.475]  Don't be nervous.
[02:01:36.835 --> 02:01:40.638]  Just let it all out, because in person back there, you're, just like me, you're very talkative.
[02:01:40.678 --> 02:01:42.019]  Once you get on air, you're a little bit more reserved.
[02:01:42.559 --> 02:01:51.785]  This is your chance to talk to your man you believe is your father, to talk to Hillary, who's just such a selfish, borderline personality disorder psycho.
[02:01:52.165 --> 02:01:53.446]  I mean, this is your chance to talk to him.
[02:01:54.301 --> 02:02:04.509]  Right, and I would like to just ask Hillary to please not get in the way of me taking this chance and asking my father for a DNA sample.
[02:02:05.630 --> 02:02:08.933]  So, in the words of Ludacris, move out the way.
[02:02:09.133 --> 02:02:09.473]  Move.
[02:02:10.814 --> 02:02:18.000]  But, you know, it's just been a difficult road and I'm just ready to, you know, get down to the bottom of it.
[02:02:18.140 --> 02:02:19.081]  Get down to the truth.
[02:02:19.681 --> 02:02:21.563]  I want to know who I am.
[02:02:24.241 --> 02:02:34.347]  My ancestors, where I come from, I mean, I love my mama and her side of my family.
[02:02:34.627 --> 02:02:35.328]  They're all black.
[02:02:36.088 --> 02:02:37.649]  They all raised me.
[02:02:38.810 --> 02:02:39.891]  They tried their best with me.
[02:02:40.971 --> 02:02:42.432]  And I turned out a good person.
[02:02:42.492 --> 02:02:45.514]  So at the end of the day, it's no lie.
[02:02:45.534 --> 02:02:46.155]  It's the truth.
[02:02:47.095 --> 02:02:48.356]  And all I want is the truth out.
[02:02:49.377 --> 02:02:51.518]  I'm not here for no political gang or nothing.
[02:02:53.602 --> 02:03:01.664]  In 1999-2000, Hillary and President Clinton helped with this false DNA test.
[02:03:01.864 --> 02:03:07.946]  And I think it was put out to discredit my story for her running up Senate to the state.
[02:03:08.446 --> 02:03:10.947]  And to be clear, we've looked at it.
[02:03:10.967 --> 02:03:15.268]  The star owned by top Clinton donors did a test that wasn't even a DNA test.
[02:03:15.308 --> 02:03:16.548]  So no wonder.
[02:03:16.568 --> 02:03:17.389]  The test showed it wasn't.
[02:03:19.853 --> 02:03:23.896]  Blood test for, you know, hepatitis for maternity isn't going to work.
[02:03:24.156 --> 02:03:24.377]  Right.
[02:03:26.098 --> 02:03:30.441]  And just... What would your mother say to you when the Christmas presents came?
[02:03:30.482 --> 02:03:31.662]  I mean, did you ever see the state troopers?
[02:03:31.722 --> 02:03:32.603]  I mean, describe that.
[02:03:32.683 --> 02:03:32.883]  Right.
[02:03:32.923 --> 02:03:34.084]  I was outside playing.
[02:03:34.264 --> 02:03:35.165]  I seen them leave.
[02:03:35.185 --> 02:03:38.268]  They didn't pull up in a state trooper police car.
[02:03:38.308 --> 02:03:39.008]  I seen them leave.
[02:03:39.168 --> 02:03:45.453]  You know, he get out with his police state trooper outfit on and I see them leave and I can read the text and it say, you know,
[02:03:46.954 --> 02:03:49.136]  State government tags on the bag.
[02:03:49.856 --> 02:03:52.258]  And as soon as they left, they brought in bags.
[02:03:52.278 --> 02:03:56.161]  As soon as they left, my aunt come get us from outside playing.
[02:03:56.201 --> 02:03:57.102]  She was like, come in.
[02:03:58.383 --> 02:04:01.345]  She's like, I got these gifts that was brought in by your dad.
[02:04:01.705 --> 02:04:03.046]  I said, brought in by my dad?
[02:04:03.286 --> 02:04:03.927]  She's like, yeah.
[02:04:04.067 --> 02:04:05.068]  I said, he brought me gifts?
[02:04:05.868 --> 02:04:06.569]  She's like, yeah.
[02:04:06.809 --> 02:04:10.572]  So me and my little brothers and sisters, we went through the gifts and split them between each other.
[02:04:11.292 --> 02:04:13.334]  And there was this one gift that stood out.
[02:04:13.374 --> 02:04:14.675]  It was a GI Joe man.
[02:04:15.706 --> 02:04:17.587]  So I took the G.I.
[02:04:17.607 --> 02:04:22.129]  Joe man and I gave the hula hoops and the other gifts to him, my little sister and him.
[02:04:22.669 --> 02:04:31.332]  But it just had me thinking, you know, at the time we was kids, so we didn't too much, you know, we went off straight to playing with the toys.
[02:04:31.893 --> 02:04:34.814]  But over the years, you know, I just think about that.
[02:04:34.894 --> 02:04:39.136]  I just I just go back into that day of when they dropped the gifts off.
[02:04:39.656 --> 02:04:44.358]  I just wonder why, if he feel that he wasn't my daddy, why even assist on
[02:04:45.737 --> 02:04:46.438]  Wasting the time.
[02:04:46.458 --> 02:04:47.018]  I'll be honest.
[02:04:47.038 --> 02:04:49.260]  I don't want to give Bill Clinton a pass, but I've always picked up on this.
[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:51.523]  He's like a twisted, sad character who's used.
[02:04:51.543 --> 02:04:52.463]  Hillary's pure evil.
[02:04:53.464 --> 02:04:54.625]  And you see that.
[02:04:54.926 --> 02:04:56.507]  You see the fact that he wanted to do the right thing.
[02:04:56.547 --> 02:04:57.668]  Let's talk about the report.
[02:04:58.029 --> 02:04:58.990]  How she shut it down.
[02:04:59.010 --> 02:05:00.831]  How your aunt tried to get you when you were a baby.
[02:05:00.851 --> 02:05:02.793]  Later when you tried to climb the fence to meet your father.
[02:05:02.813 --> 02:05:05.356]  Because this is the stuff that legend's made of.
[02:05:05.836 --> 02:05:07.318]  Only reality is this amazing.
[02:05:07.358 --> 02:05:08.499]  Danny Williams, straight ahead.
[02:05:10.399 --> 02:05:11.820]  Folks, the message is clear.
[02:05:12.200 --> 02:05:13.420]  The parallels are there.
[02:05:13.700 --> 02:05:29.265]  There are millions of ordinary Americans who've been let down, who've had a bad time, who feel the political class in Washington are detached from them, who feel so many of their representatives are politically correct parts of that liberal media elite.
[02:05:29.625 --> 02:05:37.248]  They feel people aren't standing up for them and they've actually in many cases given up on the whole electoral process and I think
[02:05:37.928 --> 02:05:42.672]  I think that you have a fantastic opportunity here with this campaign.
[02:05:43.132 --> 02:05:43.933]  You can go out.
[02:05:44.393 --> 02:05:45.815]  You can beat the pollsters.
[02:05:46.415 --> 02:05:48.156]  You can beat the commentators.
[02:05:48.597 --> 02:05:50.318]  You can beat Washington.
[02:05:50.378 --> 02:05:54.802]  Mr. Farage, you just recently resigned as the head of UKIP, still in the EU Parliament.
[02:05:55.342 --> 02:05:55.662]  Wow!
[02:05:55.723 --> 02:05:57.784]  Talk about a David versus Goliath story.
[02:05:58.104 --> 02:05:59.385]  This is epic.
[02:05:59.426 --> 02:06:06.091]  What it is, and I think the point about Brexit, Alex, is Brexit is the first victory against this phenomenon.
[02:06:06.778 --> 02:06:26.574]  Of the big banks, the big businesses, effectively owning politics, literally willfully destroying nation-state democracy, getting rid of that thing that our forebears actually fought and shed their blood to create and to preserve, our liberties, our freedoms, all of that being taken away and suddenly
[02:06:27.194 --> 02:06:31.738]  Suddenly, in a referendum that no one said we could win.
[02:06:31.758 --> 02:06:36.883]  I mean, literally, nobody thought Brexit would succeed and we've done it.
[02:06:37.684 --> 02:06:44.150]  Hillary represents everything that has gone wrong in our lives in the last couple of decades.
[02:06:44.690 --> 02:06:47.533]  She is part, you know, of that class of people.
[02:06:48.260 --> 02:06:57.624]  Who have taken us into an endless series of foreign wars that I think arguably have made things worse, certainly in Libya and elsewhere, not better.
[02:06:58.464 --> 02:07:00.045]  She is part of that phenomenon.
[02:07:00.746 --> 02:07:04.607]  Where all that seems to matter now is corporatism.
[02:07:04.968 --> 02:07:12.770]  You know, the big global companies who want to set the rule books to effectively put out of business small and medium-sized competitors.
[02:07:13.291 --> 02:07:22.434]  They have destroyed, you know, what I believe to be proper free market capitalism, where your eye can go set up a company, you know, and have a real chance of succeeding.
[02:07:22.974 --> 02:07:32.041]  And they've presided over a period where the rich have got richer, and where ordinary, decent, working people have seen their living standards deteriorate.
[02:07:32.382 --> 02:07:34.123]  She represents failure.
[02:07:34.343 --> 02:07:41.669]  And she, of course, is completely unreconciled to the vote on Brexit, because Hillary loves the European Union.
[02:07:42.029 --> 02:07:48.074]  I think she sees the European Union as a prototype for an even bigger form of world government.
[02:07:48.194 --> 02:07:49.355]  But let me make it clear.
[02:07:50.155 --> 02:08:04.465]  If you want nothing to change at all, if you want to continue with the kind of cronyism that we see with the Clinton Foundation and everything else, if you want things to stay the same, you vote for Hillary.
[02:08:04.885 --> 02:08:09.108]  I wouldn't vote for Hillary if she paid me, and I feel pretty strongly about that.
[02:08:14.512 --> 02:08:15.733]  It's Wednesday, October 12, 2016.
[02:08:18.545 --> 02:08:21.789]  Only 26 days left in the final countdown.
[02:08:22.550 --> 02:08:23.771]  Election 2016.
[02:08:25.093 --> 02:08:26.694]  Americanism vs. Globalism.
[02:08:27.816 --> 02:08:29.598]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:29.938 --> 02:08:31.580]  Broadcasting from Austin, Texas.
[02:08:31.900 --> 02:08:32.621]  Worldwide.
[02:08:47.495 --> 02:08:48.857]  Danny Williams is our guest.
[02:08:48.917 --> 02:08:59.173]  I just had one of our writers, Raquel Thelen, showing me a personal Drudge Tweet talking about all the deception that went on, the people lying to him back when all these quote DNA tests came out.
[02:08:59.193 --> 02:09:02.297]  We can probably put that up on screen and bring that up for Danny Williams.
[02:09:02.938 --> 02:09:03.338]  There it is.
[02:09:03.458 --> 02:09:10.741]  I was lied to directly by Walter Isington at the Time Magazine over DNA tests on Danny Williams, Clinton's alleged son.
[02:09:11.041 --> 02:09:11.921]  There wasn't one.
[02:09:12.322 --> 02:09:13.142]  And that's what we've proven.
[02:09:13.162 --> 02:09:15.643]  They did a test that wasn't a DNA test.
[02:09:15.663 --> 02:09:21.645]  Now, you wrote, just in your own thoughts today, questions that were probably good for me to bring up.
[02:09:22.485 --> 02:09:23.946]  But speaking of so many of these,
[02:09:26.024 --> 02:09:29.145]  Again, I go back to the beginning, addressing Bill Clinton.
[02:09:29.185 --> 02:09:36.969]  I mean, you've already said a lot, but you say, oh, I'm nervous, and I get it, you're on live radio and TV, but specifically, again, you're not political.
[02:09:37.129 --> 02:09:38.129]  I mean, you've told me this privately.
[02:09:38.249 --> 02:09:38.950]  I'm not for Trump.
[02:09:39.310 --> 02:09:40.090]  I'm not getting into Trump.
[02:09:40.170 --> 02:09:40.830]  I never even asked that.
[02:09:40.851 --> 02:09:42.851]  Did I ask you to go after, I mean, support Trump?
[02:09:42.871 --> 02:09:44.392]  No, I don't support no one.
[02:09:44.472 --> 02:09:46.873]  I'm not voting at the time.
[02:09:47.293 --> 02:09:49.714]  I mean... You just want to meet, you believe your dad.
[02:09:49.914 --> 02:09:50.775]  I just want the truth.
[02:09:51.772 --> 02:10:04.036]  I feel like if I'm standing here to prove my story and who I am and the truth behind my story, I feel that he has to stand up and prove that he's not my father if he claims that he's not my father.
[02:10:04.816 --> 02:10:09.658]  And I'd like to ask Hillary, please don't get in the way of this.
[02:10:15.180 --> 02:10:16.121]  Let me know the truth.
[02:10:16.161 --> 02:10:17.582]  You know, let it be known.
[02:10:18.003 --> 02:10:18.843]  Let the world know.
[02:10:18.963 --> 02:10:21.445]  I mean, the world know that you faked the DNA test.
[02:10:21.485 --> 02:10:24.868]  The world know that all the other public stories are out.
[02:10:24.928 --> 02:10:28.191]  So, I mean, it's my turn to answer the truth.
[02:10:28.772 --> 02:10:30.873]  I was thinking, you can do a genetic profile.
[02:10:30.934 --> 02:10:33.396]  We know Clinton's basic background.
[02:10:33.616 --> 02:10:33.776]  Right.
[02:10:33.816 --> 02:10:38.420]  And if it matches up with who he claims his backgrounds are, then he's got a lot of pressure on him.
[02:10:38.980 --> 02:10:40.622]  Here's a question, then.
[02:10:42.816 --> 02:10:44.938]  I remember researching this going back 20 years ago.
[02:10:44.958 --> 02:10:45.418]  Yes, sir.
[02:10:45.518 --> 02:10:47.340]  What did Hillary do specifically?
[02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:49.862]  I heard she threatened, correct me if I'm wrong, your mother.
[02:10:49.942 --> 02:10:50.723]  Walked through that.
[02:10:51.864 --> 02:11:00.792]  Who ended the relationship of the state police bringing you $700 a month for your mom to take care of the family and Christmas presents on Christmas?
[02:11:01.072 --> 02:11:01.533]  Right.
[02:11:01.693 --> 02:11:06.998]  And in my heart, I believe Hillary ended all of that once she made president, you know.
[02:11:08.123 --> 02:11:11.644]  Cuz it's like he wanted to have something to do with me.
[02:11:12.265 --> 02:11:19.367]  I mean, if he took the time out to deliver, have money delivered, have presents delivered, he knew in his heart and he wanted to in his heart.
[02:11:19.567 --> 02:11:23.169]  But like I say, I feel that she does have something to do with it.
[02:11:23.189 --> 02:11:27.250]  I feel that she does breaking that all up.
[02:11:28.771 --> 02:11:30.331]  Hillary, she's very smart.
[02:11:30.371 --> 02:11:35.013]  So at the time of Bill Clinton becoming to his success, she was planning her success.
[02:11:36.311 --> 02:11:40.375]  You know, and being the president for herself one day.
[02:11:40.616 --> 02:11:48.604]  So, yeah, I feel that she stepped in and, you know, covered it up, you know, had it hidden, you know, hushed it up.
[02:11:50.726 --> 02:11:53.609]  But I'll never stop.
[02:11:54.030 --> 02:11:55.411]  I want to, you know.
[02:11:56.303 --> 02:11:57.064]  Keep this going.
[02:11:57.104 --> 02:11:58.204]  I'm gonna search for the truth.
[02:11:58.404 --> 02:12:09.592]  And, you know, if it takes my life, oh, well, you know, I'd rather die trying to find the truth of who I am than back home, you know, just doing other things.
[02:12:09.652 --> 02:12:15.496]  I'd rather be, you know, dying, you know, knowing the right thing, doing the right thing.
[02:12:17.579 --> 02:12:19.060]  Are you saying you're concerned about your safety?
[02:12:19.660 --> 02:12:21.081]  I mean, yes, it's been plenty of times.
[02:12:21.261 --> 02:12:23.641]  My safety, my kids' safety.
[02:12:24.002 --> 02:12:32.285]  I'm from Little Rock, Arkansas, and I'm raising my kids in High Springs, the boyhood home of Bill Clinton, where he was raised.
[02:12:32.525 --> 02:12:38.227]  So, yeah, I feel sometimes about my safety, but I won't stop.
[02:12:39.929 --> 02:12:42.130]  Danny Williams reported son of Bill Clinton.
[02:12:42.170 --> 02:12:43.550]  I've been hearing this for 20 years.
[02:12:43.970 --> 02:12:46.011]  The witnesses, we've talked to the state police, you name it.
[02:12:46.031 --> 02:12:46.831]  I mean, this was 20 years ago.
[02:12:46.851 --> 02:12:47.532]  I was talking to his aunt.
[02:12:47.832 --> 02:12:48.792]  This isn't something new.
[02:12:48.832 --> 02:12:51.333]  It's coming up now because the Clintons are back again.
[02:12:54.274 --> 02:13:00.496]  Looking at this, why, again, why would Bill Clinton give you presents and give you money if you weren't his son?
[02:13:00.516 --> 02:13:00.736]  Right.
[02:13:00.776 --> 02:13:01.317]  Why would he?
[02:13:02.197 --> 02:13:04.418]  You know, I mean, was he playing a little game?
[02:13:04.538 --> 02:13:07.539]  You know, to me, I feel that he was trying to be in my life.
[02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:10.189]  Well, it does seem he's the more human of the two.
[02:13:11.169 --> 02:13:11.410]  Right.
[02:13:13.590 --> 02:13:14.070]  Other points.
[02:13:14.110 --> 02:13:16.030]  I've got a lot of questions, but other points you think are important?
[02:13:16.991 --> 02:13:18.231]  Other points I think are important?
[02:13:18.611 --> 02:13:23.392]  I mean, you can look at me and see, you know, see the futures of him and me.
[02:13:23.952 --> 02:13:27.092]  So, that's a major important point, you know.
[02:13:27.112 --> 02:13:31.833]  I started my Facebook page two and a half years ago, and that's what I did.
[02:13:31.873 --> 02:13:33.314]  I put me beside him.
[02:13:33.534 --> 02:13:35.394]  I wanted people to know, look at us, you know.
[02:13:36.420 --> 02:13:39.901]  And I wanted, I wanted thoughts and feedback on what people thought, you know?
[02:13:39.921 --> 02:13:46.063]  And I take, I take the good and the bad, and I keep pushing with doing what's right myself.
[02:13:47.083 --> 02:13:48.124]  Dan, let's bring this up.
[02:13:49.044 --> 02:13:50.004]  I don't judge your mother.
[02:13:50.084 --> 02:13:51.885]  Hell, half the women in the country have probably done similar things.
[02:13:52.045 --> 02:13:52.285]  Right.
[02:13:52.445 --> 02:13:53.385]  This is how the world works.
[02:13:53.965 --> 02:13:56.306]  Old's profession, and do what she has to do to feed her kids.
[02:13:57.886 --> 02:14:02.788]  There was a governing class in Little Rock, Arkansas, but looking at this,
[02:14:05.416 --> 02:14:13.979]  Why do you think, why do you think Hillary, um, well, before I get to that, look at the similar backgrounds.
[02:14:14.059 --> 02:14:17.960]  You've got Bill Clinton's mother reportedly being a prostitute to the Mafia.
[02:14:17.980 --> 02:14:18.700]  Exactly.
[02:14:18.740 --> 02:14:19.461]  In Hot Springs.
[02:14:19.741 --> 02:14:19.901]  Right.
[02:14:20.001 --> 02:14:21.781]  Well documented, that is well documented.
[02:14:21.881 --> 02:14:22.121]  Exactly.
[02:14:22.442 --> 02:14:24.382]  Reportedly to a Governor Rockefeller.
[02:14:24.402 --> 02:14:24.882]  Right.
[02:14:24.982 --> 02:14:26.883]  In Al Capone, he should run the whole country out of Little Rock.
[02:14:26.903 --> 02:14:27.023]  Right.
[02:14:27.683 --> 02:14:29.144]  In Hot Springs, he lived there half the year.
[02:14:29.864 --> 02:14:32.126]  Folks that don't know how the mafia works, that's where the moonshine was made.
[02:14:32.186 --> 02:14:32.466]  Right.
[02:14:32.586 --> 02:14:33.427]  Up until like the 40s.
[02:14:34.048 --> 02:14:40.193]  So you've got all this going on, and you've got Bill Clinton's mother, a lady the night of prostitutes, same history as your mother's.
[02:14:40.673 --> 02:14:43.556]  Maybe that's why he felt guilty, because he never got to see his father.
[02:14:44.076 --> 02:14:44.577]  Exactly.
[02:14:44.597 --> 02:14:45.257]  And you know what?
[02:14:45.578 --> 02:14:46.478]  I do my research.
[02:14:46.538 --> 02:14:48.200]  I read, I done read about all that.
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:49.701]  I've been reading about this since I was 13, 14.
[02:14:52.270 --> 02:14:57.965]  On his mother, on who his father could be, and you know, it's just like he had this hard time.
[02:14:58.026 --> 02:14:59.951]  Why would he do his own child like that?
[02:15:00.612 --> 02:15:00.913]  I mean...
[02:15:02.904 --> 02:15:07.106]  Yes, my mother was a working lady, but as far as from my understanding is that they dated.
[02:15:07.806 --> 02:15:10.507]  He came on several occasions.
[02:15:10.527 --> 02:15:11.968]  That's right, he liked her so much.
[02:15:12.028 --> 02:15:12.328]  Right.
[02:15:12.588 --> 02:15:13.148]  He kept coming.
[02:15:13.168 --> 02:15:14.369]  Wouldn't be the first time that happened.
[02:15:14.509 --> 02:15:15.249]  Right, exactly.
[02:15:15.309 --> 02:15:23.753]  So I feel that, I mean, I know she had to do what she do to take care of us, to bring in food, to bring in clothes for us, so we can, you know,
[02:15:25.970 --> 02:15:27.391]  Be alright for us.
[02:15:28.051 --> 02:15:32.813]  But at the same time, I feel that it was more than just money between him and her.
[02:15:33.413 --> 02:15:40.676]  So... Danny Williams reported a son who was basically ignored, thrown out there.
[02:15:41.416 --> 02:15:42.436]  What's the word you use?
[02:15:42.916 --> 02:15:43.737]  I use banished.
[02:15:44.017 --> 02:15:44.497]  Banished.
[02:15:44.677 --> 02:15:45.117]  Banished.
[02:15:45.217 --> 02:15:45.958]  They banished me.
[02:15:46.538 --> 02:15:48.359]  They said I was raised in Australia.
[02:15:48.399 --> 02:15:49.959]  They said I went to the goodest school.
[02:15:50.039 --> 02:15:51.400]  No, I was raised in Little Rock.
[02:15:51.700 --> 02:15:54.381]  I went to McClellan High School off God Springs and Little Rock.
[02:15:55.444 --> 02:15:56.324]  I didn't graduate.
[02:15:56.925 --> 02:16:02.527]  I got tons of Facebook friends went to school with me that can confront my story.
[02:16:02.868 --> 02:16:05.689]  That's right, but you did get your GED later.
[02:16:05.729 --> 02:16:07.350]  You have grandchildren.
[02:16:07.710 --> 02:16:09.751]  I went back to school at 21 to get my GED.
[02:16:09.811 --> 02:16:13.873]  I was trying to become a welder and taking care of my kids at the time.
[02:16:13.913 --> 02:16:15.874]  You know, I had my first child at 16.
[02:16:15.934 --> 02:16:20.676]  I was on the way with my second child at 21, so I wanted to do better for my kids, but
[02:16:21.900 --> 02:16:24.381]  I always had a setback on, what about my father?
[02:16:24.401 --> 02:16:26.062]  Well, you know, I need to know my father.
[02:16:26.422 --> 02:16:26.682]  You know?
[02:16:26.722 --> 02:16:31.225]  How early on did you hear from, like you said, the preachers in the public schools that Bill Clinton was your daddy?
[02:16:31.705 --> 02:16:31.965]  Right.
[02:16:32.225 --> 02:16:35.987]  Preachers used to come over our house all the time when I was seven, eight years old.
[02:16:36.387 --> 02:16:37.348]  I remember one preacher.
[02:16:37.688 --> 02:16:40.169]  That's Preacher McIntosh.
[02:16:40.730 --> 02:16:47.353]  He's the one that started the story on Bill Clinton when he was running for president about him having a black son.
[02:16:47.513 --> 02:16:49.114]  He called it the black sheep of the family.
[02:16:49.671 --> 02:16:52.874]  So, you know, this been going on throughout my whole life.
[02:16:53.754 --> 02:17:00.700]  Everybody I run into, oh, he look, you know, they point and they're whispering, you know, he look just like him, you know, that's Bill's son.
[02:17:01.440 --> 02:17:11.188]  And, you know, sometimes it was sad and sometimes it was, you know, it strengthened me because I knew that one day I was able to stand up for what I believe in.
[02:17:15.020 --> 02:17:19.645]  I brought this up three times, and you've done a great job, but I just want to give you the floor here.
[02:17:20.625 --> 02:17:25.931]  Danny Williams, whatever you want to say to the world, the people demonizing you at CNN, the people saying, don't cover your story.
[02:17:26.251 --> 02:17:29.734]  If your story was so weak, they'd want to cover it, because they could discredit us.
[02:17:30.295 --> 02:17:31.896]  I'd like to ask CNN to back off.
[02:17:31.976 --> 02:17:40.525]  I'd like to ask Hillary, with the most up respect, and just to please don't stand in the way.
[02:17:42.133 --> 02:17:44.934]  I would like to let my father know I does want to meet you one day.
[02:17:44.954 --> 02:17:46.375]  I does want to shake your hand.
[02:17:46.435 --> 02:17:47.375]  Well, I do want to meet you.
[02:17:47.415 --> 02:17:48.456]  I do want to shake your hand.
[02:17:48.916 --> 02:17:49.396]  Excuse me.
[02:17:50.857 --> 02:17:54.178]  I want my children to know that they have a grandfather, you know?
[02:17:55.239 --> 02:17:57.179]  And what type of grandfather he was.
[02:17:57.239 --> 02:17:58.660]  He was a good man.
[02:17:58.700 --> 02:18:01.981]  He, you know, he done good when he was president.
[02:18:02.061 --> 02:18:06.423]  I mean, but far as with my life, you know, it's just failure.
[02:18:06.763 --> 02:18:10.465]  So I just want to, you know, I just want him to know that
[02:18:11.713 --> 02:18:13.155]  I am looking forward to meet you.
[02:18:13.175 --> 02:18:15.398]  I am looking forward for my kids to know you.
[02:18:15.418 --> 02:18:17.781]  I am looking forward for a DNA sample.
[02:18:19.023 --> 02:18:20.665]  I mean, I ask you to do the right thing.
[02:18:20.685 --> 02:18:25.391]  If I was worth hundreds of millions of dollars, I'd be taking care of my grandkids.
[02:18:26.869 --> 02:18:27.870]  I don't care what color they are.
[02:18:28.050 --> 02:18:30.071]  And Danny, you come off as very credible.
[02:18:30.111 --> 02:18:31.893]  My gut tells me you're Bill Clinton's son.
[02:18:31.913 --> 02:18:33.774]  I remember the history 20 years ago.
[02:18:33.794 --> 02:18:35.455]  I remember all the cover-ups, all of it.
[02:18:36.055 --> 02:18:39.498]  And when you sit here looking at this, it's just indicative of the larger lies.
[02:18:39.518 --> 02:18:43.521]  I remember talking to the sources that knew your mother, who's still with us today.
[02:18:43.541 --> 02:18:50.826]  I mean, is it accurate that state police came and said, you shut up about this, we're going to figure out how to throw your butt in jail?
[02:18:50.846 --> 02:18:52.307]  100% accurate.
[02:18:52.667 --> 02:18:54.128]  My mom's story never changed.
[02:18:54.769 --> 02:18:56.410]  So get into what Hillary reportedly did.
[02:18:57.925 --> 02:19:20.215]  Um, well, what it was, from what I was told at 93, you know, doing all the allegations of me being his son, you know, she was trying to hush it up, you know, they was threatening her, you know, they was passing by the house, they kicked in my grandma's door, the first picture they ever got of me was the baby picture with the Arkansas Razorbacks shirt on.
[02:19:20.475 --> 02:19:23.136]  They kicked in my grandma's door and they took that.
[02:19:26.986 --> 02:19:28.027]  They took that picture.
[02:19:28.167 --> 02:19:31.670]  They kicked in my grandma's door and state troopers there and took that picture off the wall.
[02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:33.451]  That was the first picture they ever had.
[02:19:33.471 --> 02:19:35.553]  That picture was not sold to the tabloids.
[02:19:36.413 --> 02:19:38.975]  Was not, you know, it was tooken.
[02:19:39.436 --> 02:19:40.977]  So... What'd they do?
[02:19:40.997 --> 02:19:41.937]  They took that picture off the wall?
[02:19:42.418 --> 02:19:42.658]  Right.
[02:19:43.298 --> 02:19:43.939]  From my granny's house.
[02:19:43.959 --> 02:19:44.359]  Describe that.
[02:19:44.419 --> 02:19:45.020]  Take your time.
[02:19:45.900 --> 02:19:46.401]  Talk about that.
[02:19:47.557 --> 02:19:49.838]  Well, if you're not his son, why are they kicking doors down?
[02:19:49.898 --> 02:19:58.000]  Right, I mean, at the time I was a kid, I can't describe it in what my mom can, but at the time I know and she always told me how they got the first picture.
[02:19:58.580 --> 02:20:01.241]  They kicked in my granny door and they took the picture off the wall.
[02:20:01.261 --> 02:20:04.942]  Now what was the point of that?
[02:20:06.491 --> 02:20:20.789]  I don't know, at the time my mother wasn't giving the story and the preacher McIntyre came out on the story so they were trying to get in contact with my mom on stories and at the time they were trying to hush it.
[02:20:20.829 --> 02:20:22.391]  They were getting rid of the picture that proved it.
[02:20:22.711 --> 02:20:23.051]  Right.
[02:20:23.993 --> 02:20:25.615]  And so, like I said, my mama
[02:20:26.286 --> 02:20:31.110]  My mother, she took a story, she took a DNA, I mean, she took a polygraph test in 93.
[02:20:31.891 --> 02:20:32.892]  Consists of her story.
[02:20:33.192 --> 02:20:34.993]  And she passed it.
[02:20:35.013 --> 02:20:35.494]  100% passed it.
[02:20:35.934 --> 02:20:37.255]  And the story never changed today.
[02:20:37.275 --> 02:20:38.656]  It's still the same today.
[02:20:39.437 --> 02:20:41.038]  Do you remember who gave the polygraph?
[02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:45.662]  I was, in 93, I was probably 5 or 6 years old.
[02:20:45.702 --> 02:20:46.303]  No, I understand.
[02:20:46.503 --> 02:20:48.224]  You should probably talk to your mom and your aunt.
[02:20:48.244 --> 02:20:48.965]  We need to get them on.
[02:20:49.225 --> 02:20:49.485]  Right.
[02:20:49.505 --> 02:20:51.287]  Because this is powerful information, Danny.
[02:20:52.844 --> 02:20:55.385]  But look, she says she hadn't fallen down having convulsions.
[02:20:55.405 --> 02:20:56.246]  We catch it on tape.
[02:20:56.266 --> 02:20:57.766]  She says she didn't sell us out to the Chinese.
[02:20:57.786 --> 02:20:58.507]  It comes out in the WikiLeaks.
[02:20:58.687 --> 02:20:59.868]  She says she isn't running the media.
[02:20:59.888 --> 02:21:00.348]  It comes out.
[02:21:01.148 --> 02:21:02.409]  Obama says he doesn't want our guns.
[02:21:02.429 --> 02:21:03.189]  It comes out in the emails.
[02:21:03.229 --> 02:21:03.830]  He wants to ban them.
[02:21:03.870 --> 02:21:06.731]  I mean, it seems like stuff's turning against them right now.
[02:21:06.971 --> 02:21:07.291]  Right.
[02:21:07.591 --> 02:21:12.674]  She says she wanted to give the kids the best opportunities in this world.
[02:21:13.514 --> 02:21:18.477]  I'm one kid that they have turned their back on and deserve the best opportunities for my children.
[02:21:19.977 --> 02:21:27.881]  I was about to ask, I mean, because I just want to help all American children no matter what color they are, but black unemployment's basically doubled under Obama as if you just don't matter.
[02:21:27.901 --> 02:21:28.581]  Right.
[02:21:28.701 --> 02:21:32.583]  And then I see Hillary claiming how Trump's all this big racism and the rest of it.
[02:21:32.943 --> 02:21:37.706]  Separate from politics, though, I'd actually see you as an asset if I was them.
[02:21:37.746 --> 02:21:41.167]  I don't know why they didn't just admit all this and go with it later after they'd already been president.
[02:21:41.527 --> 02:21:41.988]  Exactly.
[02:21:42.068 --> 02:21:48.631]  I mean, if they had any brains that they have in this world, they would've, you know, step up.
[02:21:52.503 --> 02:22:04.398]  Danny, I can sit here and ask you a million questions, but, you know, you know, we talk about, I mean, you wrote this, I want to know what it was like to be in her presence.
[02:22:04.418 --> 02:22:07.301]  So I want to, I wanted to know what it was like.
[02:22:08.390 --> 02:22:11.672]  Well, I wanted to have the opportunities that Chelsea had.
[02:22:12.172 --> 02:22:13.373]  I wanted to... Yeah, because I'm reading this.
[02:22:13.393 --> 02:22:14.614]  You wrote this before you came on.
[02:22:14.654 --> 02:22:15.694]  I said, hey, give me some questions.
[02:22:15.714 --> 02:22:18.856]  All of this was written about me, I mean... These are so personal, though.
[02:22:18.876 --> 02:22:20.657]  I don't even know what they mean, because it's your thoughts.
[02:22:20.677 --> 02:22:25.039]  It's like, I wanted to know what it was like to be, you know, her parents.
[02:22:25.079 --> 02:22:27.161]  Explain these questions you wanted me to ask you.
[02:22:27.181 --> 02:22:27.541]  You go ahead.
[02:22:29.423 --> 02:22:31.624]  I mean, basically... This is from my heart.
[02:22:31.644 --> 02:22:37.945]  Right before you went live, I said, write out what it is, and to be honest, I get it so from your heart, it's like so personal, I don't know what it means.
[02:22:37.965 --> 02:22:47.847]  At the time, okay, I said about last year, at the time Hillary had a campaign at Philanders Mill College, which is a black-owned college in Little Rock, Arkansas.
[02:22:48.787 --> 02:22:53.228]  I'd never been in her presence, so at the time I wanted to know how did it feel to be in her presence.
[02:22:53.749 --> 02:22:55.149]  So we went to the campaign.
[02:22:56.360 --> 02:22:56.680]  Man, it's
[02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:15.000]  I don't
[02:23:33.638 --> 02:23:37.479]  It was hurtful and then, you know, as I left, you know, I tried to get a picture with her.
[02:23:37.999 --> 02:23:39.400]  They hurry up and got her out of there.
[02:23:39.840 --> 02:23:45.501]  So, like I said, it was hurtful as I left because I kept thinking about, like, you know, she know me.
[02:23:45.781 --> 02:23:48.282]  She knows about my story.
[02:23:48.302 --> 02:23:49.822]  She knows about me being her son.
[02:23:49.842 --> 02:23:54.703]  She's talking about family and being true to her family and there you are wanting this connection or discover.
[02:23:56.044 --> 02:23:56.264]  Wow.
[02:23:56.604 --> 02:23:57.044]  Exactly.
[02:23:57.784 --> 02:24:00.505]  And so, you know, and it hurt because she talked about
[02:24:01.556 --> 02:24:03.217]  Her family, her mother, you know.
[02:24:03.237 --> 02:24:04.597]  So I'm like, you know.
[02:24:05.938 --> 02:24:08.058]  Let's go through some more of these points you wanted to make.
[02:24:08.839 --> 02:24:09.519]  There's so many.
[02:24:09.859 --> 02:24:15.661]  I love the fact, because we didn't script this, knowing my father helped so many people in the world.
[02:24:17.273 --> 02:24:19.775]  I mean, I could differ with that, but this is how honest this all is.
[02:24:19.795 --> 02:24:20.796]  These questions.
[02:24:21.297 --> 02:24:23.879]  I mean, you're thinking he's this really great guy and you're wondering why this is happening.
[02:24:23.999 --> 02:24:26.661]  I mean, because I take trips to his library.
[02:24:26.701 --> 02:24:28.262]  I take my kids to his library.
[02:24:28.282 --> 02:24:30.264]  You know, I let them know, you know, this is your grandfather.
[02:24:30.284 --> 02:24:31.025]  Because that's in Little Rock.
[02:24:31.125 --> 02:24:31.485]  Right.
[02:24:32.186 --> 02:24:35.609]  And just all the pictures of, you know, him doing so much.
[02:24:36.513 --> 02:24:37.254]  He didn't help Haiti.
[02:24:37.294 --> 02:24:40.697]  He didn't help, you know, he didn't done so much for the world.
[02:24:40.757 --> 02:24:43.779]  It's just like, you know, what have he done for me?
[02:24:43.839 --> 02:24:45.360]  Why haven't he done nothing for me?
[02:24:45.380 --> 02:24:47.082]  I don't think he's helping him like he helps Haiti.
[02:24:47.342 --> 02:24:47.782]  Right.
[02:24:49.544 --> 02:24:50.885]  You know what he really did in Haiti?
[02:24:51.085 --> 02:24:52.687]  I don't want to talk about my dad here.
[02:24:53.027 --> 02:24:55.389]  This is surreal, folks, because he really wrote these.
[02:24:55.409 --> 02:24:56.790]  This is how much he loves his dad.
[02:24:57.371 --> 02:24:58.812]  This is our big scripted thing.
[02:24:58.872 --> 02:25:00.113]  How scripted we heard it before.
[02:25:00.193 --> 02:25:03.996]  I want to cry because I don't want to say stuff here with this man who I believe is Bill Clinton's son.
[02:25:05.677 --> 02:25:08.618]  I just, at this point, this is getting too real.
[02:25:08.698 --> 02:25:20.102]  I mean, Bill Clinton up there, you know, doing what he's doing, Obama attacking me, Hillary attacking me, and all I know is they're doing all this bad stuff and these people claim they've got a monopoly on being good, Danny.
[02:25:20.502 --> 02:25:22.043]  And I'm gonna tell you, Danny, they're not good people.
[02:25:22.243 --> 02:25:22.743]  No, they're not.
[02:25:22.763 --> 02:25:29.465]  And I gotta tell you, in between Hillary and Obama and Bill, I'm not saying this to make you feel good, Hillary is way worse than both of them.
[02:25:29.705 --> 02:25:29.965]  Right.
[02:25:30.926 --> 02:25:31.546]  I think so too.
[02:25:33.516 --> 02:25:35.337]  Like, she sit up and say, Black Lives Matter.
[02:25:35.377 --> 02:25:37.178]  I mean, I want to do my Black Lives Matter.
[02:25:38.800 --> 02:25:39.120]  Do it.
[02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:40.701]  Well, let me tell you something.
[02:25:41.201 --> 02:25:44.143]  I ever get some beautiful black lady pregnant, I'm going to take care of the kids I have with her.
[02:25:44.423 --> 02:25:45.044]  I love kids.
[02:25:45.684 --> 02:25:48.206]  I'm not sitting here on some high horse, but how the hell would he take care of his kids?
[02:25:48.506 --> 02:25:49.026]  I love kids.
[02:25:49.066 --> 02:25:50.007]  I'm raising mine.
[02:25:50.167 --> 02:25:51.888]  I help raise my little sisters and brothers.
[02:25:52.449 --> 02:25:53.309]  Had my first child at 16.
[02:25:53.409 --> 02:25:54.970]  I'm still raising my kids.
[02:25:55.010 --> 02:25:56.451]  Don't you have, like, what do you got, three kids?
[02:25:56.951 --> 02:25:57.932]  I got five kids.
[02:25:57.952 --> 02:25:58.893]  Wow, five kids.
[02:25:58.933 --> 02:25:59.973]  Three girls, two boys.
[02:26:00.674 --> 02:26:01.174]  Ages from 3 to 13.
[02:26:02.657 --> 02:26:03.437]  Aren't they entertaining?
[02:26:04.378 --> 02:26:05.619]  Definitely entertaining.
[02:26:05.899 --> 02:26:07.840]  I love all their personalities.
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:09.621]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:26:09.661 --> 02:26:21.248]  I mean, for me to experience that and he didn't even get to experience it in my life, it's like, it's saddening because every day of my life, being in my kid's life, I think about what, why I didn't have this, you know?
[02:26:21.508 --> 02:26:23.089]  It just reflects back onto me.
[02:26:23.490 --> 02:26:23.870]  To me.
[02:26:24.450 --> 02:26:29.053]  All I gotta say is, I just love the fact that an hour before it came on, I said, I'm not going to ask you a prepared question.
[02:26:29.093 --> 02:26:30.254]  I said, write what you want to talk about.
[02:26:30.774 --> 02:26:36.310]  A lot of this is how you love your dad, and how you think he's done so much good, so why does he do it for you?
[02:26:36.531 --> 02:26:37.433]  I think he's amazing.
[02:26:37.513 --> 02:26:38.195]  I love to me.
[02:26:38.985 --> 02:26:41.386]  I mean, I'd love to meet Alito of the Free World.
[02:26:41.426 --> 02:26:44.867]  He was a leader of the Free World that done damn good about what he done.
[02:26:44.887 --> 02:26:46.208]  I want to tell the corporate media something.
[02:26:46.228 --> 02:26:47.088]  See, I don't do like you.
[02:26:47.148 --> 02:26:49.189]  I would have had all this pre-written stuff and pre-planned it.
[02:26:49.209 --> 02:26:50.909]  I mean, I got him here saying his dad's great.
[02:26:50.969 --> 02:26:52.510]  I mean, we're just covering what he thinks.
[02:26:53.390 --> 02:26:55.091]  Everybody in Arkansas knew about people.
[02:26:55.171 --> 02:26:55.851]  Well, point at me.
[02:26:55.891 --> 02:26:56.711]  That's powerful.
[02:26:57.071 --> 02:26:59.372]  Bill Clinton had a man deliver money.
[02:26:59.412 --> 02:27:00.052]  We've covered that.
[02:27:00.112 --> 02:27:01.113]  I've confirmed that happened.
[02:27:01.193 --> 02:27:01.713]  Right, correct.
[02:27:02.133 --> 02:27:06.015]  Your Aunt Lucille always asks you if I remember the time she toured the Governor's Mansion.
[02:27:06.055 --> 02:27:06.875]  We've talked about that.
[02:27:07.985 --> 02:27:11.787]  I gotta tell you, Danny, it's just so real to meet somebody from Arkansas, great folks up there.
[02:27:12.807 --> 02:27:14.868]  Now you say, I want to shake my father's hand.
[02:27:14.888 --> 02:27:15.648]  Let's talk about that.
[02:27:16.089 --> 02:27:17.009]  I love to shake his hand.
[02:27:17.089 --> 02:27:20.571]  I love, I would love to grab him and hug him one day.
[02:27:21.211 --> 02:27:24.972]  You know, and just experience that, you know, it's my father.
[02:27:25.012 --> 02:27:26.193]  I want to meet my father.
[02:27:27.353 --> 02:27:27.934]  I mean,
[02:27:29.235 --> 02:27:32.797]  My little brother's sister's daddy, he, time to time, he took care of us, you know.
[02:27:32.917 --> 02:27:33.977]  He did his best he could.
[02:27:33.997 --> 02:27:35.078]  He was a mechanic.
[02:27:35.118 --> 02:27:40.481]  He taught me how to do mechanic work, you know, but I wanted to meet my own father.
[02:27:40.541 --> 02:27:42.082]  I knew that he wasn't my father.
[02:27:42.602 --> 02:27:45.543]  Even, he never told me, but I knew that he wasn't my father.
[02:27:46.964 --> 02:27:47.985]  You see the difference.
[02:27:48.245 --> 02:27:49.846]  My little sisters and brothers, they are black.
[02:27:50.106 --> 02:27:53.928]  So you see the difference, and you know, and that's with me and my feelings in growing up.
[02:27:54.642 --> 02:27:55.783]  I'm like, I know this now.
[02:27:55.843 --> 02:27:58.384]  My mom black, my dad black, my little sisters and brothers black.
[02:27:58.424 --> 02:28:00.245]  I know this now, my real father.
[02:28:00.305 --> 02:28:03.066]  You know, I wanted to always know my father.
[02:28:03.206 --> 02:28:05.407]  And my mother, my mother's story never changed.
[02:28:05.487 --> 02:28:10.790]  And with her marrying Danny Williams, my stepfather, she still consists of Bill Clinton being my father.
[02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:11.750]  It never changed.
[02:28:11.930 --> 02:28:12.130]  Sure.
[02:28:12.170 --> 02:28:13.251]  Look, I mean, let's go back.
[02:28:13.291 --> 02:28:14.011]  This is important.
[02:28:15.012 --> 02:28:17.393]  The first time, when did she say Bill Clinton's her father?
[02:28:17.413 --> 02:28:21.435]  I mean, I had to been like ages ranging, ranging from
[02:28:22.678 --> 02:28:22.978]  I don't
[02:28:44.062 --> 02:28:49.886]  Good person that, you know, he was, but even though he wasn't there for us, she just thought highly of me.
[02:28:49.906 --> 02:28:51.707]  She was still looking up to him even though he did that.
[02:28:52.148 --> 02:28:55.970]  I mean, it ain't that she, it ain't that we hate.
[02:28:56.230 --> 02:28:57.371]  Well, it's not bad that she was there.
[02:28:57.391 --> 02:28:59.853]  Right, it ain't that we hate because we don't practice hate.
[02:28:59.873 --> 02:29:01.394]  We're trying to teach our kids better.
[02:29:01.774 --> 02:29:05.597]  So it ain't that we hate, it's that we need to know the truth.
[02:29:06.738 --> 02:29:07.878]  And we deserve the truth.
[02:29:09.419 --> 02:29:12.281]  And you deserve to not have your family reject you, Danny.
[02:29:12.682 --> 02:29:13.102]  Exactly.
[02:29:15.199 --> 02:29:20.483]  Well, I know Bill Clinton's scared of this, and Bill Clinton has gone a long way down the dark side, I can tell you that right now.
[02:29:21.504 --> 02:29:23.385]  I just think it's still time for him to reprieve himself.
[02:29:23.445 --> 02:29:25.827]  I think Bill Clinton still has somewhat of a soul left.
[02:29:26.248 --> 02:29:27.148]  I'll be honest about that.
[02:29:27.168 --> 02:29:28.229]  I don't think Hillary has one.
[02:29:29.210 --> 02:29:30.151]  And I'm honest about that.
[02:29:30.171 --> 02:29:31.352]  She does.
[02:29:31.412 --> 02:29:31.652]  Right.
[02:29:32.132 --> 02:29:33.333]  She's totally turned over to evil, my friend.
[02:29:33.353 --> 02:29:35.755]  We're going to come back and finish up with you with any other comments you want to make.
[02:29:36.255 --> 02:29:40.959]  We've got special reports and more we're going to air, but I tell you, this is more powerful than I even thought it would be, Danny Williams.
[02:29:41.680 --> 02:29:42.160]  Let's come back.
[02:29:42.200 --> 02:29:43.221]  Be sure to give out your Facebook.
[02:29:44.614 --> 02:29:48.077]  Notice there's a media blackout on this, a total ban, a censorship.
[02:29:48.897 --> 02:29:51.660]  It's a Drudge Report story from his sources.
[02:29:52.060 --> 02:29:53.821]  They are not allowed to talk about Danny Williams.
[02:29:54.182 --> 02:29:56.143]  We need to make sure his story gets out, listeners.
[02:29:56.424 --> 02:29:57.644]  Stay with us.
[02:29:58.885 --> 02:29:59.766]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.287 --> 02:30:01.888]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.809 --> 02:30:05.491]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.217 --> 02:30:12.279]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[02:30:12.519 --> 02:30:13.860]  It's like lightning in a bottle!

[02:31:18.621 --> 02:31:26.732]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:31:27.032 --> 02:31:31.718]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:31:45.856 --> 02:31:47.657]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[02:31:47.757 --> 02:31:52.719]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:31:52.879 --> 02:31:57.241]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[02:32:09.366 --> 02:32:14.329]  There's an unprecedented crackdown underway against Christians worshipping in secret in Iran.
[02:32:14.509 --> 02:32:19.633]  Iranian police enter family parties and weddings in an effort to find those who've turned their backs on Islam.
[02:32:19.913 --> 02:32:31.541]  Iranian Christian news source Mohabat News reports that a house raid on September 30th resulted in the arrest of five men who were taken to an unknown location and charged with evangelism, a crime that could mean death in Iran.
[02:32:31.581 --> 02:32:39.206]  In a 2016 report, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom said that Christians and other minorities in Iran continue to experience severe
[02:32:39.326 --> 02:32:39.726]  We're good to go.
[02:33:10.356 --> 02:33:10.916]  We've got it.
[02:33:10.956 --> 02:33:17.400]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:33:17.480 --> 02:33:19.581]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:21.862 --> 02:33:27.485]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:29.007 --> 02:33:32.271]  Russians are being told to immediately bring back children from abroad.
[02:33:32.912 --> 02:33:36.557]  Russia's done nuclear warfare attack drills with 40 million evacuating major cities.
[02:33:37.018 --> 02:33:43.927]  Russia, President Vladimir Putin is canceling diplomatic events in Paris and other things for nuclear war.
[02:33:44.708 --> 02:33:46.068]  I'm very calmly announcing that.
[02:33:46.108 --> 02:33:49.069]  These stories are on DrudgeReport.com, InfoWars.com.
[02:33:49.109 --> 02:33:50.029]  Here's Business Insider.
[02:33:50.449 --> 02:33:53.770]  Get ready for a severe fall in the stock market, HSBC says.
[02:33:54.390 --> 02:33:57.231]  So as gloom and doom as I could ever get, it's now happening.
[02:33:57.491 --> 02:34:04.333]  My biggest problem is everything we've warned of is now happening, so our credibility is uber ultra high.
[02:34:06.193 --> 02:34:07.394]  I wish this was not the case.
[02:34:07.534 --> 02:34:07.895]  It is.
[02:34:08.475 --> 02:34:10.857]  Again, we want to thank Drudge for carrying Danny Williams today.
[02:34:12.258 --> 02:34:16.082]  Anybody could probably ask better questions than I did, but it's surreal to be here going through all this.
[02:34:16.682 --> 02:34:18.904]  I've seen an order's blackout of Clinton's son.
[02:34:19.405 --> 02:34:21.727]  Danny's live interview, Hillary ignores him.
[02:34:22.147 --> 02:34:24.909]  Those stories are up on DrudgeReport.com.
[02:34:24.929 --> 02:34:26.571]  They're also up on Infowars.com.
[02:34:26.591 --> 02:34:28.332]  He leaves us here in about five minutes.
[02:34:28.352 --> 02:34:32.336]  I'm going to get into the huge Russia developments, the stock market developments, because while we're busy,
[02:34:33.851 --> 02:34:38.953]  Focusing on the Clintons, they're just the little globalist minions that have been put in to kind of be the front people.
[02:34:39.413 --> 02:34:41.314]  It's the power behind the throne we should be looking at.
[02:34:41.774 --> 02:34:44.855]  Which is why I hope Bill Clinton and Hillary rediscover their humanity.
[02:34:44.875 --> 02:34:50.658]  And I said, Danny, in closing, and I want to give you the floor, so you can just speak from the heart, what else do you want to say?
[02:34:50.698 --> 02:34:51.278]  You said, well...
[02:34:52.156 --> 02:34:54.438]  I just wish that Hillary would move out of the way.
[02:34:54.518 --> 02:35:08.448]  So, Danny, you've got four or five minutes, then we're going to obviously, after you have lunch, talk to you for the nightly news with any other little tidbits, but you're here, you've been told your whole life you're a Bill Clinton son, you have your presence, all this, they've been putting out fake DNA tests, all this is coming out.
[02:35:08.849 --> 02:35:10.690]  What do you want to say to, you were saying Hillary?
[02:35:11.050 --> 02:35:15.033]  Yes, I mean, I want to ask Hillary, please don't get in the way of this.
[02:35:16.034 --> 02:35:20.698]  And I would like to ask Clinton to please step up and take a DNA and give,
[02:35:21.883 --> 02:35:24.924]  Give me a DNA sample so we can put this all to rest.
[02:35:25.364 --> 02:35:26.585]  I mean, we know what's true.
[02:35:28.145 --> 02:35:29.966]  Just, you know, step up and face it.
[02:35:32.607 --> 02:35:39.430]  And I like to say, I like to ask CNN to back off on me speaking the truth about who I am.
[02:35:41.147 --> 02:35:44.670]  When I start, I will keep doing what I have to do to get my story out.
[02:35:44.810 --> 02:35:45.610]  Let me ask this question.
[02:35:45.630 --> 02:35:48.692]  This is bigger than politics because I've been honest with people.
[02:35:49.533 --> 02:35:56.638]  If Hillary gets in, unless she shuts down all free speech, which she can try, it's a gamble, we're going to get world famous, biggest thing in the world.
[02:35:57.078 --> 02:36:00.601]  Trump gets in, I'm tied to him, he won't be able to fix everything, I'll get blamed for that.
[02:36:00.621 --> 02:36:02.862]  We're going to be hurt by Trump being in.
[02:36:02.882 --> 02:36:06.285]  If I was Machiavellian, I'd go for Hillary, at least privately.
[02:36:06.625 --> 02:36:06.985]  I'm not.
[02:36:08.026 --> 02:36:08.987]  I really care about humanity.
[02:36:10.339 --> 02:36:10.979]  I do the right thing.
[02:36:10.999 --> 02:36:12.120]  I don't care where the chips fall.
[02:36:12.140 --> 02:36:12.721]  I do the right thing.
[02:36:12.741 --> 02:36:13.481]  That's how I operate.
[02:36:13.902 --> 02:36:15.923]  It's hard enough to tell the truth, much less make crap up.
[02:36:15.983 --> 02:36:16.844]  I mean, I'm just going to tell the truth.
[02:36:16.864 --> 02:36:17.204]  That's the thing.
[02:36:17.224 --> 02:36:17.824]  I know everybody knows it.
[02:36:17.984 --> 02:36:18.425]  Exactly.
[02:36:18.645 --> 02:36:22.047]  But would you?
[02:36:22.247 --> 02:36:31.234]  We didn't talk about this privately, but if the Clintons, nondisclosures, whatever, when you got there, met with them, not even monetary, but just admit he's your daddy, hug you.
[02:36:32.099 --> 02:36:33.680]  He'll take you on a vacation once a year.
[02:36:33.940 --> 02:36:34.720]  That's what you want.
[02:36:34.780 --> 02:36:35.821]  Imagine wanting to know your dad.
[02:36:36.321 --> 02:36:37.281]  Correct.
[02:36:37.321 --> 02:36:41.323]  So it's not, you told us probably, we were talking about probably, you said I don't want money, I just want to know he's my dad.
[02:36:41.623 --> 02:36:42.504]  I want him to acknowledge me.
[02:36:42.764 --> 02:36:44.044]  What is it you're looking for from Bill?
[02:36:44.084 --> 02:36:48.886]  You're not just here wanting a paycheck from some guy that gets... I'm not just here for a paycheck, I'm here for an acknowledgement.
[02:36:49.507 --> 02:36:53.128]  I want him to acknowledge me on who I am and that I am his son.
[02:36:53.148 --> 02:37:01.432]  I mean, I know, I know personally in my heart and believe in my heart that I am his son.
[02:37:02.406 --> 02:37:06.730]  I just want him to step up and, you know, step up to the plate.
[02:37:10.312 --> 02:37:12.574]  But like you said, Hillary, he did step up somewhat.
[02:37:13.175 --> 02:37:13.655]  Exactly.
[02:37:13.715 --> 02:37:15.336]  I felt he did step up somewhat.
[02:37:15.416 --> 02:37:18.579]  Other than that, we wouldn't receive the money we received, the gifts we received.
[02:37:19.099 --> 02:37:21.181]  So I felt that he wanted a part of my life.
[02:37:21.561 --> 02:37:25.445]  So that's the reason I'm here today to ask Hillary, please do not get in the way.
[02:37:25.465 --> 02:37:30.829]  And please, Mr. Clinton, step up to the plate.
[02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:39.132]  I don't want to prompt you, I haven't done that any, because I just feel people should say what they believe.
[02:37:39.152 --> 02:37:39.752]  Right.
[02:37:40.012 --> 02:37:41.353]  But you believe he's your dad.
[02:37:41.393 --> 02:37:42.633]  I mean, do you want to address him as your dad?
[02:37:43.394 --> 02:37:43.734]  Yes, sir.
[02:37:45.855 --> 02:37:48.716]  I'm Danny Williams, the son of Bill Clinton.
[02:37:49.676 --> 02:37:54.478]  I'm here today to get the truth out about me and who I am.
[02:37:56.019 --> 02:38:00.101]  Yes, I want to address you as my dad, and I want to know the truth.
[02:38:01.784 --> 02:38:04.986]  I want to get to the bottom of it and know the truth about you being my father.
[02:38:05.467 --> 02:38:09.890]  I want to know all about you, all about your family.
[02:38:12.351 --> 02:38:12.691]  Thank you.
[02:38:14.573 --> 02:38:17.034]  So you just want to be recognized by your family?
[02:38:17.595 --> 02:38:17.895]  Right.
[02:38:19.976 --> 02:38:20.817]  Very powerful, Danny.
[02:38:20.837 --> 02:38:23.559]  I believe you and I talked to the state troopers and others off record.
[02:38:24.522 --> 02:38:28.044]  And I hit a nerve with you, your family on, and a bunch of other things.
[02:38:28.064 --> 02:38:28.945]  I don't know what hit the nerve.
[02:38:28.965 --> 02:38:29.365]  Right.
[02:38:29.385 --> 02:38:31.266]  It was Waco, it was you, it was a bunch of stuff.
[02:38:31.306 --> 02:38:33.087]  I was going after the Clintons and they got pissed.
[02:38:33.368 --> 02:38:33.568]  Right.
[02:38:34.208 --> 02:38:36.029]  And they wouldn't do that if it wasn't real.
[02:38:36.249 --> 02:38:46.696]  I mean, hell, there's people all over the internet claiming I'm married to them and I raped them and I'm an Easter Bunny and I'm a devil worshiper and I'm a Vatican assassin and I work for Israel and I work for reptiles and I... It's not true!
[02:38:46.996 --> 02:38:48.577]  I'm not a space alien, so I don't care.
[02:38:48.597 --> 02:38:52.099]  But let me tell you, they get really upset when you get brought up.
[02:38:52.580 --> 02:38:52.800]  Right.
[02:38:54.147 --> 02:38:54.587]  They should.
[02:38:54.648 --> 02:38:55.729]  I mean, it's been nice.
[02:38:55.769 --> 02:38:59.392]  I went to bed hungry, balled up, starving.
[02:38:59.412 --> 02:39:04.477]  Because I had to make sure my baby brother and sister eat and went without eating.
[02:39:05.237 --> 02:39:06.138]  You know, they should.
[02:39:10.362 --> 02:39:12.484]  I mean... It's okay, go ahead and say it.
[02:39:12.524 --> 02:39:13.365]  Whatever else you want to add.
[02:39:13.945 --> 02:39:14.886]  I'm trying to keep from crying.
[02:39:14.926 --> 02:39:15.427]  It's okay.
[02:39:16.408 --> 02:39:17.248]  But yeah, they should.
[02:39:17.549 --> 02:39:18.850]  When did you think of the suicide?
[02:39:19.909 --> 02:39:32.876]  I mean I was in my teens and going through, you know, as far as house to house, clothes not clean, you know, on the streets just, you know, living the way bombs live, you know, and it just was hurtful.
[02:39:34.076 --> 02:39:37.798]  And then I just had to pull myself out of that, you know.
[02:39:37.918 --> 02:39:39.599]  I've been taking care of me and my kids.
[02:39:40.079 --> 02:39:41.240]  I'm not asking for money.
[02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:43.661]  I'm asking for a simple acknowledgement and a DNA.
[02:39:44.221 --> 02:39:44.602]  That's it.
[02:39:48.419 --> 02:39:51.842]  Bill Clinton can still redeem his humanity, but he has to do it before he dies.
[02:39:52.543 --> 02:39:53.683]  He looks pretty long on the tooth.
[02:39:54.164 --> 02:39:54.384]  Right.
[02:39:55.565 --> 02:39:58.267]  That's another one of the points you wanted me to ask you.
[02:39:58.347 --> 02:39:59.488]  Your dad doesn't look too good.
[02:39:59.508 --> 02:40:00.990]  You just want to meet him before he dies?
[02:40:01.030 --> 02:40:01.310]  Right.
[02:40:01.390 --> 02:40:02.531]  He does look unhealthy.
[02:40:03.332 --> 02:40:06.094]  And I does feel, you know, his time is winding down here.
[02:40:06.614 --> 02:40:07.575]  And I does want to meet him.
[02:40:07.635 --> 02:40:08.856]  I want my kids to know him.
[02:40:10.197 --> 02:40:11.578]  We want to know who our father is.
[02:40:11.779 --> 02:40:12.980]  I want to know who my father is.
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:14.461]  They want to know who their grandfather is.
[02:40:17.327 --> 02:40:22.972]  Like your mother told you, she knew he was a daddy because there was one white guy.
[02:40:23.312 --> 02:40:27.756]  One white guy that she had been involved with at that time.
[02:40:28.917 --> 02:40:34.082]  I'd say it was probably 1984, around March of 1984.
[02:40:34.202 --> 02:40:36.664]  I go back because I was born in 1985, December the 7th, 1985.
[02:40:36.704 --> 02:40:37.225]  So, you know,
[02:40:42.665 --> 02:40:48.388]  I go back, I think about, you know, I do a lot of research and, you know, and I ask her, and like I say, her story never changed.
[02:40:48.448 --> 02:40:50.609]  It's always been consistent.
[02:40:50.649 --> 02:40:51.710]  It's always been the same.
[02:40:53.270 --> 02:40:54.291]  Well, is she proud of what you're doing now?
[02:40:55.365 --> 02:40:56.466]  Yeah, she's very proud.
[02:40:56.566 --> 02:41:00.208]  I mean, she's probably somewhere breaking down crying because I'm trying to keep from crying myself.
[02:41:00.389 --> 02:41:02.390]  So, I know she's very proud.
[02:41:02.630 --> 02:41:09.035]  Well, Danny, I'll tell you, you take a risk doing this, so do I. We're not bragging, but the Clintons are, people who back them are particularly evil.
[02:41:09.435 --> 02:41:18.941]  And so, we're here telling it like it is, and I believe your story, and I hope you get some justice, and I hope the people out there that are paying corporate minions, you know, aren't too nasty about this, but don't take it bad.
[02:41:19.342 --> 02:41:20.983]  You've just come here and told the truth.
[02:41:21.563 --> 02:41:27.405]  You put out this report, Bill Clinton Sons, tells Hillary, step aside, dealing with all the horrible things she's done.
[02:41:27.945 --> 02:41:30.366]  It's up on Infowars.com, DrudgeReport.com.
[02:41:30.726 --> 02:41:32.667]  We appreciate the courage of all these affiliates.
[02:41:32.707 --> 02:41:34.707]  Bottom line, we're just exploring this.
[02:41:34.727 --> 02:41:43.910]  We were proven right about Hillary being sick, proven right about the gun control, proven right about the TPP, NSA spying, proven right on Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, Drudge was.
[02:41:44.670 --> 02:41:46.371]  We get it right 99% of the time.
[02:41:46.931 --> 02:41:49.972]  And I think if it comes out and there's a third party to do a DNA test, you know,
[02:41:50.552 --> 02:41:53.395]  And then they say that you're not his son, and I think you would accept that.
[02:41:53.935 --> 02:41:54.136]  Right.
[02:41:55.277 --> 02:41:57.098]  All right, Danny Williams, well, thank you.
[02:41:57.199 --> 02:41:57.679]  Anything else?
[02:41:57.979 --> 02:42:01.823]  I want to thank you for giving me the chance to speak my story on your show.
[02:42:03.585 --> 02:42:04.506]  And I just want to, you know...
[02:42:05.782 --> 02:42:19.208]  I used to have my story heard, and you know, and get it out there, and him knowing that, you know, I'm trying my best to, you know, avoid from, avoid, you know, I'm trying my best to get it out the best way I can.
[02:42:19.228 --> 02:42:21.249]  Yeah, no, your whole thing is how great the Clintons are.
[02:42:21.369 --> 02:42:21.609]  Right.
[02:42:21.809 --> 02:42:22.350]  I get it.
[02:42:22.450 --> 02:42:22.810]  Thank you.
[02:42:22.850 --> 02:42:23.190]  I get it.
[02:42:23.210 --> 02:42:24.030]  You're not attacking them.
[02:42:24.771 --> 02:42:26.271]  And we're not here trying to get you to do that.
[02:42:26.452 --> 02:42:26.612]  Right.
[02:42:26.672 --> 02:42:27.832]  I'm not trying to attack no one.
[02:42:27.912 --> 02:42:28.793]  I mean, that's not me.
[02:42:28.813 --> 02:42:29.613]  That's not in my care.
[02:42:29.633 --> 02:42:31.074]  If the Clintons were good folks, we'd want them.
[02:42:31.214 --> 02:42:31.614]  Exactly.
[02:42:32.854 --> 02:42:33.555]  We don't want war.
[02:42:33.575 --> 02:42:34.775]  We don't want poverty.
[02:42:34.875 --> 02:42:35.475]  We want wealth.
[02:42:35.495 --> 02:42:36.256]  We want success.
[02:42:36.956 --> 02:42:37.376]  Get out the way.
[02:42:37.576 --> 02:42:39.197]  I want my kids to have the best success.
[02:42:40.557 --> 02:42:41.718]  Well, I'll be honest with you, Danny.
[02:42:41.738 --> 02:42:42.698]  Donald Trump wants that.
[02:42:42.938 --> 02:42:44.019]  That's why they hate his guts.
[02:42:44.039 --> 02:42:44.679]  Not the Clintons.
[02:42:44.699 --> 02:42:46.760]  But the controllers already have the economy taken over.
[02:42:46.780 --> 02:42:47.700]  They don't want competition.
[02:42:47.940 --> 02:42:48.360]  Exactly.
[02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:49.841]  And a free market does that.
[02:42:50.081 --> 02:42:51.041]  Now, you've got your Facebook.
[02:42:51.061 --> 02:42:51.702]  You've got your Twitter.
[02:42:51.722 --> 02:42:52.502]  We can put them on screen.
[02:42:52.582 --> 02:42:52.922]  Correct.
[02:42:53.182 --> 02:42:57.664]  What's the best way for other media that wants to not follow CNN's orders to interview you?
[02:42:59.745 --> 02:43:00.445]  The best way is...
[02:43:01.846 --> 02:43:04.288]  The best way is follow me the way I've been doing.
[02:43:04.508 --> 02:43:11.032]  I've been doing Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, anything I can download to put my story out there.
[02:43:11.132 --> 02:43:12.092]  The best way is follow me.
[02:43:12.172 --> 02:43:15.214]  I got Danny Williams, my Facebook.
[02:43:15.254 --> 02:43:17.075]  I got my fan page is Danny Williams Clint.
[02:43:18.256 --> 02:43:21.878]  Anything you'd like to know about me, log on to my Facebook.
[02:43:22.839 --> 02:43:24.300]  Inbox me, I inbox you back.
[02:43:25.740 --> 02:43:26.061]  Thank you.
[02:43:27.006 --> 02:43:27.566]  Absolutely.
[02:43:27.606 --> 02:43:28.587]  So you're ready to do interviews now.
[02:43:28.607 --> 02:43:29.547]  This is the first live one.
[02:43:30.247 --> 02:43:32.588]  Again, thank you so much for giving us the first interview, sir.
[02:43:32.748 --> 02:43:34.089]  I thank you too, Mr. Alex.
[02:43:34.449 --> 02:43:36.790]  You know, whether it was John McAfee or you name it, they say.
[02:43:37.190 --> 02:43:39.551]  McAfee goes, I don't know who you are, but everybody says you'll let me talk.
[02:43:39.971 --> 02:43:40.271]  Right.
[02:43:40.311 --> 02:43:42.612]  So, you know, there's not some preconceived, you know, agenda here.
[02:43:42.872 --> 02:43:43.052]  No.
[02:43:43.312 --> 02:43:44.733]  And you got over your points, Al, you know.
[02:43:44.933 --> 02:43:45.313]  Yes, sir.
[02:43:45.513 --> 02:43:47.854]  Bill Clinton's a great guy and everything, so you just want to meet your father.
[02:43:48.214 --> 02:43:48.674]  Exactly.
[02:43:50.375 --> 02:43:54.156]  In 30 years, all my life, all I want to ever do is know the truth.
[02:43:54.956 --> 02:43:55.997]  Denny Williams, thank you, my friend.
[02:43:56.117 --> 02:43:56.397]  Thank you.
[02:43:57.102 --> 02:43:58.824]  All right, that's Danny Williams, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:43:59.144 --> 02:44:00.165]  I'm going to go to a couple clips here.
[02:44:00.185 --> 02:44:02.547]  I'm going to walk him back because he hasn't eaten in about 10 hours.
[02:44:02.567 --> 02:44:04.088]  I guess he ate something when he got off the plane.
[02:44:04.108 --> 02:44:05.250]  We're going to have him have a little snack.
[02:44:06.090 --> 02:44:09.153]  We're going to come back, and then we have, who's hosting the fourth hour today?
[02:44:10.614 --> 02:44:11.735]  David Knight hosting the fourth hour.
[02:44:11.755 --> 02:44:15.359]  I've got a bunch of Russia war news and economy news that, quite frankly, has got me shaking.
[02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:18.121]  So we're going to be going over all that.
[02:44:18.161 --> 02:44:19.663]  But first, let's play
[02:44:21.072 --> 02:44:33.703]  This Trump, where Trump talks about disloyalty in the party with O'Reilly, who's laughing at him, talking about how these guys are total sell-offs in this conspiracy, and then the Mike Huckabee compares Trump to Clinton.
[02:44:33.723 --> 02:44:38.508]  We're going to play both those back-to-back, then come back after the break, and I'll get into the Russia situation and the economy.
[02:44:38.728 --> 02:44:39.769]  Danny Williams, thank you, my friend.
[02:44:39.789 --> 02:44:41.090]  Appreciate your courage.
[02:44:41.110 --> 02:44:43.992]  Appreciate everybody else covering this today.
[02:44:44.233 --> 02:44:44.833]  We'll be back.
[02:44:44.913 --> 02:44:45.314]  Stay with us.
[02:44:46.789 --> 02:44:47.730]  We're good to go.
[02:45:16.969 --> 02:45:18.350]  He didn't like the tape thing.
[02:45:18.430 --> 02:45:23.095]  He's never heard, oh give me a break, he's never heard salty language before.
[02:45:23.135 --> 02:45:30.961]  You know John McCain, who has probably the dirtiest mouth in all of the Senate, has never heard, you know he talked about lewd, it's lewd language.
[02:45:31.021 --> 02:45:32.623]  Can I ask a question please?
[02:45:33.343 --> 02:45:37.747]  If you're elected president, you're going to need McCain and you're going to need Ryan.
[02:45:37.787 --> 02:45:39.028]  You're going to need these guys.
[02:45:39.048 --> 02:45:39.589]  They'll be there.
[02:45:39.609 --> 02:45:40.630]  They'll be there.
[02:45:41.610 --> 02:45:43.431]  I would think that Ryan maybe wouldn't be there.
[02:45:43.451 --> 02:45:44.812]  Maybe he'll be in a different position.
[02:45:45.212 --> 02:45:46.573]  But McCain will be there.
[02:45:46.613 --> 02:45:47.293]  They'll all be there.
[02:45:47.773 --> 02:45:51.175]  And you think they're going to all cooperate with you after you trash in them?
[02:45:51.555 --> 02:45:52.176]  I get along.
[02:45:52.416 --> 02:45:53.416]  I know you don't believe this.
[02:45:53.496 --> 02:45:57.058]  Well, I get along with you for 20 years, so I guess I can get along with anybody, frankly.
[02:45:57.118 --> 02:46:00.080]  But to be honest with you, Bill, I get along with people.
[02:46:00.740 --> 02:46:04.183]  And I think you know that maybe better than anybody.
[02:46:04.263 --> 02:46:06.485]  I don't know what good it does to trash people.
[02:46:06.525 --> 02:46:12.230]  You could say I disagree, I wish they would endorse me, but to trash him, I don't know what good that does.
[02:46:12.510 --> 02:46:21.418]  Because he was begging for my endorsement, people are calling, his friends are calling, and then the first sign of a little bit of difficulty, he unendorses him.
[02:46:21.759 --> 02:46:24.981]  I wouldn't want to be in a foxhole with a lot of these people, that I can tell you.
[02:46:27.123 --> 02:46:56.455]  While we've talked about the hit Trump's taken in the polls as a result of that tape and so on, I don't know that sort of the mainstream Republican class or, you know, even sort of these elites, if you will, understand how invigorating it was for Trump supporters to see Trump turn to Hillary Clinton and let her have it on some of those issues like emails and trustworthiness and honesty, which we've never seen anybody look right at her and do!
[02:46:57.532 --> 02:47:00.413]  The one thing you have to say about Trump, that he is fearless.
[02:47:00.873 --> 02:47:08.415]  This is a guy that is comfortable enough in his views, whether you like them or not, that he's going to take it straight to the other person, to their face.
[02:47:08.455 --> 02:47:09.375]  He's not two-faced.
[02:47:09.675 --> 02:47:10.435]  He's not a phony.
[02:47:10.736 --> 02:47:12.436]  Look, I've said this about him, Megan.
[02:47:12.456 --> 02:47:15.757]  He's like Captain Quint in the original movie, Jaws.
[02:47:16.297 --> 02:47:17.037]  He's vulgar.
[02:47:17.317 --> 02:47:18.077]  He's salty.
[02:47:18.338 --> 02:47:19.758]  He might even get drunk.
[02:47:20.078 --> 02:47:21.478]  He's just a... He doesn't drink!
[02:47:21.518 --> 02:47:21.918]  Terrible!
[02:47:22.439 --> 02:47:23.279]  But hold on here.
[02:47:23.299 --> 02:47:23.539]  Okay.
[02:47:24.139 --> 02:47:27.902]  He's the guy who's gonna save your butt and save your family.
[02:47:28.242 --> 02:47:32.365]  And so at the end of the day, when he kills the shark, you're happy about it.
[02:47:32.565 --> 02:47:34.067]  Now, Hillary is the shark.
[02:47:34.327 --> 02:47:35.448]  She's gonna eat your boat.
[02:47:36.088 --> 02:47:37.449]  She's gonna have open borders.
[02:47:38.410 --> 02:47:39.931]  Immigration out the kazoo.
[02:47:40.551 --> 02:47:47.096]  And so the choice is, do you vote for Captain Quint, who's gonna save your family, or do you vote for the shark?
[02:47:47.617 --> 02:47:49.018]  That's the choice you get to make.
[02:47:50.458 --> 02:47:52.060]  And now we've got Jerry Falwell Jr.
[02:47:52.201 --> 02:47:53.663]  as if the conspiracy was secret.
[02:47:53.703 --> 02:47:55.004]  They said they were going to get Trump.
[02:47:55.325 --> 02:47:56.867]  We're going to sabotage him and Hillary.
[02:47:57.348 --> 02:48:02.074]  The horrible Republicans, the worst of the worst, have resembled themselves, have revealed themselves.
[02:48:02.395 --> 02:48:03.176]  We've got to get rid of them.
[02:48:03.416 --> 02:48:04.758]  Here is the Jerry Falwell Jr.
[02:48:04.778 --> 02:48:04.979]  Club.
[02:48:06.107 --> 02:48:08.107]  Well, the whole story just fell in my lap.
[02:48:08.167 --> 02:48:17.730]  About six or eight weeks ago, I got a phone call from someone who's very close to the top establishment candidates in the Republican Party.
[02:48:18.150 --> 02:48:21.450]  People who wanted to be president over the last four or five years.
[02:48:21.690 --> 02:48:24.971]  And he told me, he said, Jerry, something strange is going on.
[02:48:25.011 --> 02:48:32.873]  They're meeting regularly and they tell me that it's a certainty that Donald Trump will not be the nominee.
[02:48:33.633 --> 02:48:35.695]  On November 8th of the Republican Party.
[02:48:36.216 --> 02:48:42.361]  And I called one of Trump's attorneys, I told him about it, but there was no more details than that, so there was nothing anybody could do.
[02:48:42.942 --> 02:48:54.172]  But then when I saw what happened this weekend, and I saw how quickly all the usual suspects jumped on it and started calling for Trump to step down as the nominee.
[02:48:54.352 --> 02:48:56.774]  The suspects, who are the usual suspects?
[02:48:57.540 --> 02:48:58.080]  Paul Ryan?
[02:48:58.301 --> 02:48:59.261]  The establishment.
[02:48:59.621 --> 02:49:00.922]  The establishment candidates.
[02:49:00.962 --> 02:49:04.485]  He was one that just disinvited Trump almost immediately.
[02:49:04.565 --> 02:49:06.046]  It's almost like he knew it was coming.
[02:49:07.086 --> 02:49:16.633]  Are these people who are associated with the RNC, with the leadership on Capitol Hill of either the Senate or the House, how high does it rise?
[02:49:18.729 --> 02:49:21.670]  Very high, but not necessarily the people you just mentioned.
[02:49:21.690 --> 02:49:30.192]  I think it's people who were candidates at some point in the last year or four years or five years.
[02:49:30.932 --> 02:49:32.613]  And so it's very high level.
[02:49:35.513 --> 02:49:39.974]  It's the Bush Global Crime Syndicate that's hooked in with the Communist Chinese and the big banks.
[02:49:40.555 --> 02:49:41.435]  They're the people put in.
[02:49:41.455 --> 02:49:45.396]  They admit they'll never let Trump in, but they failed stealing the nomination.
[02:49:46.530 --> 02:49:47.371]  They're failing now.
[02:49:48.173 --> 02:49:50.677]  They orchestrated this giant hoax, like, oh, it's over for him.
[02:49:50.697 --> 02:49:51.919]  They'll do it again and again.
[02:49:51.939 --> 02:49:52.720]  That's what they do.
[02:49:53.281 --> 02:49:55.524]  Because Trump isn't out to get you.
[02:49:57.199 --> 02:50:03.321]  Meanwhile, they're so arrogant, they would put a corpse forward to be president, like Hillary Clinton.
[02:50:04.102 --> 02:50:07.043]  And Donald Trump has a new powerful ad that exposes it.
[02:50:07.123 --> 02:50:07.543]  Here it is.
[02:50:08.464 --> 02:50:12.245]  Our next president faces daunting challenges in a dangerous world.
[02:50:12.525 --> 02:50:13.986]  Iran promoting terrorism.
[02:50:14.006 --> 02:50:15.546]  North Korea threatening.
[02:50:15.846 --> 02:50:16.947]  ISIS on the rise.
[02:50:17.367 --> 02:50:19.488]  Libya and North Africa in chaos.
[02:50:19.828 --> 02:50:23.929]  Hillary Clinton failed every single time as Secretary of State.
[02:50:24.329 --> 02:50:25.789]  Now she wants to be President.
[02:50:26.029 --> 02:50:30.750]  Hillary Clinton doesn't have the fortitude, strength, or stamina to lead in our world.
[02:50:31.251 --> 02:50:32.931]  She failed as Secretary of State.
[02:50:33.131 --> 02:50:34.811]  Don't let her fail us again.
[02:50:35.492 --> 02:50:37.472]  Now, we talk about things being surreal.
[02:50:37.492 --> 02:50:40.593]  When we come back in the final segment, I'm going to host that David Knight takes over.
[02:50:41.863 --> 02:50:42.963]  I have all the Russian news.
[02:50:43.984 --> 02:50:50.705]  And it's getting so dangerous, I can't believe it, when it ties in with mainstream news on the economy.
[02:50:51.905 --> 02:50:55.666]  Get ready for a, quote, severe fall in stock market HSBC.
[02:50:57.287 --> 02:50:59.547]  They are engineering this thing big time.
[02:51:00.948 --> 02:51:04.969]  The Russians are telling their citizens to come home from abroad right now.
[02:51:05.449 --> 02:51:06.549]  That's the final straw.
[02:51:10.384 --> 02:51:12.027]  I'm going to lay it out short and sweet.
[02:51:13.729 --> 02:51:19.398]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[02:51:20.099 --> 02:51:23.986]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[02:51:24.921 --> 02:51:27.164]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[02:51:27.244 --> 02:51:28.406]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[02:51:28.426 --> 02:51:31.650]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[02:51:32.611 --> 02:51:32.971]  Or more.
[02:51:33.052 --> 02:51:34.954]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[02:51:35.475 --> 02:51:36.957]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[02:51:37.057 --> 02:51:40.421]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[02:51:40.521 --> 02:51:42.283]  It's actually scary.
[02:51:43.144 --> 02:51:53.250]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[02:51:54.231 --> 02:52:07.039]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.

[02:52:43.552 --> 02:52:49.519]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[02:53:10.291 --> 02:53:15.158]  Russia has ordered all of its officials to fly home, including any relatives living abroad.
[02:53:15.338 --> 02:53:19.403]  This news comes as tension mounts over the prospect of pending global war.
[02:53:19.423 --> 02:53:24.610]  A failure to heed the instruction could put promotion chances at risk, according to local reports from Moscow.
[02:53:25.111 --> 02:53:27.853]  This news comes amid worsening relations between Russia and the U.S.
[02:53:27.953 --> 02:53:28.673]  over Syria.
[02:53:28.834 --> 02:53:34.017]  Politicians and high-ranking figures are said to have received a direct warning from Russian President Vladimir Putin.
[02:53:34.137 --> 02:53:40.001]  This news comes as Putin has cancelled a planned visit to France amid conflict over Moscow's role in the Syrian theater.
[02:53:40.161 --> 02:53:45.925]  Just days after this news emerged, the Kremlin has moved nuclear-capable missiles near the Polish border.
[02:53:46.125 --> 02:53:53.110]  Russian political analyst Stanislav Bilkowski said this is all part of a package of measures to prepare elites to some big war.
[02:53:53.430 --> 02:53:55.292]  Relations between Russia and the U.S.
[02:53:55.472 --> 02:53:59.115]  are at their lowest since the Cold War and continue to deteriorate.
[02:53:59.315 --> 02:54:06.521]  Even former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has warned the world is in a dangerous point due to rising tensions between Russia and the U.S.
[02:54:06.801 --> 02:54:09.464]  I'm Margaret Hale reporting for InfoWars.com
[02:54:19.153 --> 02:54:20.974]  Top story on DrugsReport.com.
[02:54:21.454 --> 02:54:23.314]  CNN orders blackout on Clinton's son.
[02:54:23.654 --> 02:54:25.215]  Let's say Danny Williams isn't his son.
[02:54:25.275 --> 02:54:26.015]  I believe he is.
[02:54:26.035 --> 02:54:27.596]  Danny believes he is.
[02:54:28.276 --> 02:54:29.756]  I've been covering this 20 plus years.
[02:54:30.737 --> 02:54:31.357]  Or maybe 20.
[02:54:31.417 --> 02:54:33.137]  I was on there about a year before I covered Danny Williams.
[02:54:34.258 --> 02:54:34.958]  Danny believes it.
[02:54:34.998 --> 02:54:35.958]  He looks like Bill Clinton.
[02:54:36.018 --> 02:54:37.039]  I'm talking to state police.
[02:54:37.059 --> 02:54:38.039]  This has gone on forever.
[02:54:38.059 --> 02:54:41.280]  There was a fake DNA test that never happened.
[02:54:41.300 --> 02:54:42.040]  That's been confirmed.
[02:54:43.661 --> 02:54:46.802]  And all I know is that Clinton's lied to us about everything.
[02:54:46.822 --> 02:54:47.302]  Her health.
[02:54:47.382 --> 02:54:47.802]  You name it.
[02:54:48.675 --> 02:55:01.658]  Sheenan orders blackout on Clinton's son, just like they did on health care, just like they did on the health care penalties and Obamacare and gun control and world government.
[02:55:01.998 --> 02:55:07.740]  And now here comes Donald Trump, who reads Drudge every day.
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:14.761]  And he goes and gives a big speech saying Hillary wants world government, unlimited immigration, rule by corporations.
[02:55:15.062 --> 02:55:16.562]  That's all true under TPP.
[02:55:17.722 --> 02:55:18.842]  Where is the fault with Trump?
[02:55:21.464 --> 02:55:25.105]  Emails reveal more collusion between state and Clinton campaign.
[02:55:25.425 --> 02:55:28.807]  While she's being investigated, she's running the Justice Department and State Department.
[02:55:29.047 --> 02:55:36.050]  Meanwhile, in San Antonio, they're spraying Islamic, Islam or die things on Christian churches.
[02:55:37.991 --> 02:55:39.331]  I mean, this is just getting ridiculous.
[02:55:39.372 --> 02:55:40.692]  And then I've got these stories right here.
[02:55:41.312 --> 02:55:44.034]  I mean, I read these stories, and I don't even know what to make of them.
[02:55:44.094 --> 02:55:44.774]  It's so crazy.
[02:55:46.034 --> 02:55:46.915]  I'm going to say something right now.
[02:55:48.340 --> 02:55:53.363]  Russia has been on the right because they have less than three military bases, like two and a half.
[02:55:54.004 --> 02:55:56.225]  They have like one coaling station, two military bases.
[02:55:56.566 --> 02:55:57.626]  They've not been offensive.
[02:55:58.307 --> 02:56:04.111]  But Russia's being tricked into offensive action, which will bankrupt Russia.
[02:56:05.051 --> 02:56:10.155]  Russia's announcing they're going to start putting or looking at putting troops and missiles in Cuba, which I know our government's done on their border.
[02:56:10.275 --> 02:56:10.875]  It's reasonable.
[02:56:11.336 --> 02:56:12.276]  And troops in Latin America.
[02:56:12.296 --> 02:56:14.578]  That's going to actually, though, make Russia a real threat.
[02:56:15.799 --> 02:56:16.099]  And then
[02:56:18.643 --> 02:56:21.966]  It's just like, I didn't want to war with Islam, but once they brought him here, I had to have the war.
[02:56:22.546 --> 02:56:32.214]  I'm not going to ever side with the globalists against Russia, because they're just trying to destroy my own country as well, but Russia should really back off, because it's not going to help Russia doing that.
[02:56:32.274 --> 02:56:34.776]  But, whatever, Russia has a right to fight back.
[02:56:34.856 --> 02:56:37.899]  Russia military practicing martial law over nuclear war risk.
[02:56:38.319 --> 02:56:40.801]  That's Infowars.com, Associated Press.
[02:56:41.262 --> 02:56:43.804]  Putin postpones visit to France amid diplomatic tensions.
[02:56:45.326 --> 02:56:53.350]  Russia tells foreign Russians living abroad, that's the story up right now, to get out of those countries and come back to Russia.
[02:56:53.370 --> 02:56:56.011]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[02:56:56.072 --> 02:56:57.792]  I think I had that article pulled up, I can't see it now.
[02:56:57.832 --> 02:56:58.713]  Maybe find it on Drudge.
[02:56:59.333 --> 02:57:01.614]  Russia considers opening military bases in Cuba.
[02:57:01.634 --> 02:57:02.895]  I mentioned that in Latin America.
[02:57:03.315 --> 02:57:06.237]  Putin, we know, destroyed aid confo in Aleppo, Syria.
[02:57:06.677 --> 02:57:09.778]  We're concerned with the deterioration of Russian-American relations, Putin said.
[02:57:10.799 --> 02:57:12.420]  And they know it was our military order to do it.
[02:57:13.448 --> 02:57:17.910]  Arms dealer says administration made him safe scapegoat on Libyan operation to protect Clinton.
[02:57:19.350 --> 02:57:21.471]  They blamed him for the weapons Clinton got to Al Qaeda.
[02:57:21.911 --> 02:57:24.573]  Pakistan spies he protecting terrorist journalist claims.
[02:57:25.153 --> 02:57:27.634]  But I had that one article I had print on but I don't have it.
[02:57:28.274 --> 02:57:29.134]  It was the most important.
[02:57:29.154 --> 02:57:30.755]  I think it was Associated Press as well.
[02:57:31.575 --> 02:57:33.176]  Where Russians tell foreigners abroad.
[02:57:33.196 --> 02:57:34.797]  You notice that Zero Hedge has it.
[02:57:35.097 --> 02:57:38.878]  Russian government officials told to immediately bring back children studying abroad.
[02:57:39.258 --> 02:57:42.340]  That's the next step to ambassadors being pulled and then you're
[02:57:43.220 --> 02:57:47.043]  Not one second to midnight, the second hand is ticking into it.
[02:57:48.184 --> 02:57:52.667]  So I'm here battling about Danny Williams and, you know, the media and Obama talking about me.
[02:57:52.767 --> 02:57:53.328]  I don't care.
[02:57:53.828 --> 02:57:55.409]  Just stop starting World War III.
[02:57:55.469 --> 02:57:56.510]  And why would they start World War III?
[02:57:57.010 --> 02:57:58.912]  To economically cover up what they've done.
[02:57:59.352 --> 02:58:02.435]  When you have a world financial collapse, the elites always launch a war.
[02:58:03.916 --> 02:58:08.279]  That's globalist, robber baron, British Empire, Rothschild, Rockefeller doctrine.
[02:58:11.152 --> 02:58:12.914]  The stock market goes down, they take you to war.
[02:58:12.954 --> 02:58:14.697]  We should get Gerald Solentig on the next few days.
[02:58:15.338 --> 02:58:15.838]  Red Alert!
[02:58:15.898 --> 02:58:17.841]  Get ready for a severe fall in the stock market.
[02:58:18.001 --> 02:58:21.186]  HSBC says, I'll do five more minutes and hand the baton to David Knight.
[02:58:21.206 --> 02:58:23.188]  But first, didn't plug all this hour.
[02:58:24.110 --> 02:58:24.891]  We need your support.
[02:58:26.004 --> 02:58:29.765]  We need you to... You need to get DNA Force, 23% off, and this is today.
[02:58:30.106 --> 02:58:45.491]  You need to get a knockout that's got the melatonin, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, and like six other ingredients, lower price, the same price, the same dose as melatonin in a bottle, $19.95 normally, $14.96 right now, 25% off, and that purchase funds the operation.
[02:58:45.831 --> 02:58:49.413]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, stay with us.
[02:58:49.453 --> 02:58:50.913]  We'll be right back with the fourth hour.
[02:58:50.933 --> 02:58:55.295]  By the way, infowars.com forward slash show to find it.
[02:58:59.830 --> 02:59:01.592]  Over the years, brain force is here.
[02:59:02.133 --> 02:59:04.396]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:59:04.676 --> 02:59:12.485]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of brain force.
[02:59:13.280 --> 02:59:16.842]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[02:59:16.862 --> 02:59:19.204]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:59:19.564 --> 02:59:23.087]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:59:23.147 --> 02:59:26.269]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:59:26.769 --> 02:59:31.993]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:59:32.113 --> 02:59:33.954]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[02:59:34.294 --> 02:59:38.717]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:59:38.877 --> 02:59:40.899]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:59:41.519 --> 02:59:42.980]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:59:43.120 --> 02:59:43.380]  Exactly.
[02:59:43.400 --> 02:59:47.222]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:59:47.682 --> 02:59:54.945]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:55.166 --> 02:59:56.886]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:16.565 --> 03:00:24.232]  The answer... The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:24.332 --> 03:00:31.158]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:31.178 --> 03:00:34.060]  Alright, so the whole world is moving towards war.
[03:00:34.300 --> 03:00:35.521]  Stock markets are melting down.
[03:00:35.721 --> 03:00:37.103]  As we told you about seven months ago,
[03:00:38.579 --> 03:00:41.721]  Deutsche Bank is going to go bigger belly up than Lehman Brothers in 2007.
[03:00:42.001 --> 03:00:49.985]  Business Insider reports a red alert get ready for a severe fall, that's a quote, in the stock market, HSBC says.
[03:00:51.426 --> 03:00:54.747]  HSBC technical analyst, and they signal that to cause the plunge.
[03:00:56.608 --> 03:00:58.269]  That's sort of the ultimate warning signal.
[03:00:59.170 --> 03:01:01.471]  A note to clients released Wednesday.
[03:01:02.611 --> 03:01:07.374]  Murray Gunn, the head of technical analyst for HSBC, said he had become a red alert.
[03:01:10.807 --> 03:01:16.972]  Remember six weeks ago?
[03:01:17.952 --> 03:01:19.093]  We saw similar headlines.
[03:01:21.735 --> 03:01:22.856]  Remember eight months ago?
[03:01:23.416 --> 03:01:26.358]  Royal Bank of Scotland, sell everything you've got this paper.
[03:01:27.779 --> 03:01:29.260]  That's the establishment saying that.
[03:01:30.652 --> 03:01:33.573]  Almost made me want to buy things, but here's what they know.
[03:01:33.653 --> 03:01:36.535]  They want to look like the winners when it all starts going belly up.
[03:01:37.255 --> 03:01:41.317]  And basically every major financial institution says this is the season we're in.
[03:01:42.618 --> 03:01:45.899]  And the Russians are getting their diplomatic families out of the West.
[03:01:46.680 --> 03:01:49.241]  They're canceling diplomatic meetings with heads of state.
[03:01:49.881 --> 03:01:57.245]  They're doing 40 million nuclear warfare evacuation drills and saying it's for nuclear war.
[03:01:58.240 --> 03:02:02.623]  And the United States, controlled by the globalists, has moved nuclear missiles right up to the border with Russia.
[03:02:02.643 --> 03:02:04.985]  And Russia says, what do we do?
[03:02:05.025 --> 03:02:06.406]  I guess we move missiles into Cuba.
[03:02:09.008 --> 03:02:14.232]  And we've got a government that wants our military to wear high heels and wants to have trainees as our top commandos.
[03:02:15.213 --> 03:02:20.657]  Not to be nice to trainees, folks, but to sabotage the country and have us all in fighting about a man in a dress.
[03:02:21.577 --> 03:02:23.379]  Supposedly in high heels, going to storm
[03:02:24.833 --> 03:02:25.834]  A machine gun nest.
[03:02:26.735 --> 03:02:29.817]  While we're debating that, the globalists are about to bring down the whole world.
[03:02:30.378 --> 03:02:31.579]  They're moving into their bunkers.
[03:02:32.360 --> 03:02:39.886]  I hope this can all be averted, but... A tell-tale sign was two years ago, this is now all confirmed, when they just said, let anybody in.
[03:02:40.067 --> 03:02:43.750]  Any China, Middle East, Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America.
[03:02:44.030 --> 03:02:48.754]  We don't care if they have tuberculosis, this drug, I mean, it's a death sentence for thousands.
[03:02:48.874 --> 03:02:51.517]  Each person you let in with that is thousands that are gonna get it, hundreds will die.
[03:02:53.735 --> 03:02:55.956]  The plague, the black plague, bubonic plague.
[03:02:56.937 --> 03:02:58.097]  Uh, leprosy.
[03:02:58.317 --> 03:02:58.897]  It's all back.
[03:03:00.478 --> 03:03:01.559]  And it's not like they just let them in.
[03:03:01.839 --> 03:03:04.040]  They don't like, oh, you're here with leprosy, let's treat you, you're here with TB.
[03:03:04.260 --> 03:03:05.561]  No, you go, oh, just come on in.
[03:03:07.221 --> 03:03:09.802]  You sit back and go, what's the strategy there?
[03:03:12.144 --> 03:03:12.504]  One thing.
[03:03:14.385 --> 03:03:15.165]  Collapse the country.
[03:03:20.359 --> 03:03:21.360]  That hit me a few weeks ago.
[03:03:21.380 --> 03:03:25.361]  I mean, I'm not stupid, but sometimes problems are too obvious to get right away.
[03:03:25.401 --> 03:03:33.185]  You know, it's the easier problems that are hard to equate, to deduce, to complete, to transact.
[03:03:35.206 --> 03:03:37.027]  What's the right word for doing a math problem?
[03:03:37.167 --> 03:03:37.867]  Complete, I guess.
[03:03:39.988 --> 03:03:44.110]  They're calling everybody that's against global government, world government, looting, corruption, a Russian agent.
[03:03:44.631 --> 03:03:46.892]  Because Russia is just one country trying to crawl out of this.
[03:03:47.915 --> 03:03:52.657]  And that's because they're going to have a war with Russia and arrest everybody who's their opposition.
[03:03:52.797 --> 03:03:53.758]  My God.
[03:03:55.058 --> 03:04:00.160]  The problem is you ran this equation in 1917 with a disarmed serf population in Russia.
[03:04:00.541 --> 03:04:03.542]  You run it in other countries like China with a disarmed serf population.
[03:04:04.542 --> 03:04:09.965]  You're going to run this in the most armed camp in the world with all the ancestral memory to fight you?
[03:04:10.545 --> 03:04:13.987]  You take our current weakness and malaise as a sign of weakness?
[03:04:15.127 --> 03:04:15.367]  Huh.
[03:04:16.508 --> 03:04:16.888]  Okay.
[03:04:19.747 --> 03:04:23.590]  If it's what you want, your figurehead can hardly walk.
[03:04:25.491 --> 03:04:39.320]  If it's what all you people think you're gods, because you got little fake, ironic glasses, and you look like Rachel Maddow, and everybody's asexual, so you went to a cool college, and you all told each other how smart you were, so you think you're going to win a civil war with us.
[03:04:42.142 --> 03:04:43.103]  I'm just going to step aside.
[03:04:43.123 --> 03:04:44.424]  I've already done my work at that point.
[03:04:46.423 --> 03:04:46.843]  Good luck.
[03:04:46.863 --> 03:04:48.043]  That's all I have to tell you.
[03:04:48.684 --> 03:04:49.944]  I'll be staying out of the way.
[03:04:50.004 --> 03:04:54.325]  But you... You won't have a prayer.
[03:04:54.345 --> 03:04:57.926]  So... It won't even matter.
[03:04:57.946 --> 03:04:59.406]  Your elites won't even protect you anyways.
[03:04:59.446 --> 03:05:00.506]  There's no honor among thieves.
[03:05:01.286 --> 03:05:02.226]  Please support the broadcast.
[03:05:02.246 --> 03:05:02.687]  Spread the word.
[03:05:02.727 --> 03:05:03.307]  It's one of a kind.
[03:05:03.327 --> 03:05:04.367]  Thank you for all your support.
[03:05:04.827 --> 03:05:08.988]  David Knight is coming in for a fresh 55 minutes of transmission starting now.
[03:05:11.232 --> 03:05:21.441]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[03:05:21.981 --> 03:05:33.671]  And others who are kind of at the very fringe of the conspiracy movement like Alex Jones are being kind of incorporated into the campaign in ways it's a or even the recent choices of campaign management.
[03:05:33.971 --> 03:05:39.095]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle as we've been chronicling here.
[03:05:39.135 --> 03:05:40.196]  Jones is the show with the
[03:05:40.476 --> 03:05:44.258]  Conspiracy theorist and creator of the fringe website InfoWars.
[03:05:44.619 --> 03:05:47.640]  Do you also know that Hillary Clinton uses a wheelchair?
[03:05:48.721 --> 03:05:54.784]  Her personal vehicle has had to be outfitted with a wheelchair lift because she is not a person who can actually walk.
[03:05:55.565 --> 03:05:58.647]  She secretly uses a wheelchair all those times you think you've seen her walking.
[03:05:58.687 --> 03:05:59.607]  She hasn't been walking.
[03:05:59.807 --> 03:06:00.348]  Did you know that?
[03:06:01.208 --> 03:06:04.150]  Hillary Clinton has been on the campaign trail for 18 months.
[03:06:04.210 --> 03:06:06.791]  Her energy staggers me.
[03:06:07.492 --> 03:06:09.053]  I have a hard time keeping up with her.
[03:06:13.559 --> 03:06:18.102]  The historical first in electing the first conspiracy freak president.
[03:06:18.362 --> 03:06:19.843]  He's not pivoting for presidential.
[03:06:20.063 --> 03:06:21.664]  He's pivoting to Alex Jones.
[03:06:21.704 --> 03:06:23.044]  He's pivoting to crazy.
[03:06:23.545 --> 03:06:28.067]  Was Hillary wearing an earpiece during last night's presidential forum?
[03:06:28.807 --> 03:06:38.093]  That is the pilot, the captain of America's conspiracy theory mothership, Alex Jones.
[03:06:38.113 --> 03:06:40.214]  You just had to keep digging, didn't you Alex?
[03:06:41.599 --> 03:06:42.760]  The plan was so simple.
[03:06:42.860 --> 03:06:47.204]  All Hillary had to do was open a jar of pickles, and the White House would be all ours.
[03:06:47.364 --> 03:06:49.726]  You're gonna be part of the conspiracy now, you realize that, right?
[03:06:49.746 --> 03:06:50.707]  I'm gonna try and do my best.
[03:06:50.887 --> 03:06:52.628]  Alex Jones is gonna be all over you!
[03:06:52.648 --> 03:06:53.569]  Let's see what happens.
[03:06:53.589 --> 03:06:54.289]  Okay, here we go.
[03:06:55.050 --> 03:06:55.510]  Here it is.
[03:06:55.531 --> 03:06:56.852]  Whoa, blitzer.
[03:06:57.632 --> 03:06:57.993]  Oh, no!
[03:06:59.974 --> 03:07:00.515]  Oh, there was a...
[03:07:02.449 --> 03:07:06.651]  They're all in on this total conspiracy theory that literally came from InfoWars.
[03:07:06.991 --> 03:07:08.932]  First of all, Hayes, I'll get you for this segment.
[03:07:09.833 --> 03:07:13.955]  It may take years and cost thousands of lives, but I'll get you for this.
[03:07:14.315 --> 03:07:24.140]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[03:07:25.401 --> 03:07:27.482]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[03:07:30.714 --> 03:07:35.779]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:36.219 --> 03:07:39.101]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[03:07:40.042 --> 03:07:43.545]  And it matters because it's not just the kook fringe.
[03:07:43.605 --> 03:07:50.091]  It's not just the sort of remunerative conspiracy theory world of that part of the conservative media machine.
[03:07:50.371 --> 03:07:55.336]  It's not even just wacky people who have made their way into Republican politics at a surprising height.
[03:07:55.576 --> 03:07:57.338]  This is now the top of the Republican ticket.
[03:08:20.034 --> 03:08:22.179]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:08:22.720 --> 03:08:27.850]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:08:33.098 --> 03:08:36.540]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones broadcast.
[03:08:36.600 --> 03:08:38.881]  I'm David Knight on this Wednesday, October 12, 2016.
[03:08:39.001 --> 03:08:42.482]  We've got a lot of news to cover.
[03:08:42.522 --> 03:08:55.768]  Donald Trump really broke down what's behind Hillary Clinton's world government based on these emails that have been leaked from John Podesta, her campaign manager, and comments that have been made at the speeches that she's given to these various banks.
[03:08:55.828 --> 03:08:56.609]  We now know
[03:08:57.529 --> 03:09:05.792]  And we have a document that tells you she knows exactly the method that she's going to enact world government, and she defines what world government is.
[03:09:05.892 --> 03:09:12.574]  And Donald Trump broke that down for a massive group of supporters yesterday, over 8,000 people that he was speaking to.
[03:09:12.994 --> 03:09:14.215]  We're going to talk about that in a moment.
[03:09:14.235 --> 03:09:20.617]  We're going to talk about the FemDems, which is what I call them, the feminist Democrats, who are really
[03:09:21.317 --> 03:09:25.561]  Nothing more than the hateful left as they go out and attack rape victims.
[03:09:25.601 --> 03:09:27.022]  We see this throughout the media as well.
[03:09:27.503 --> 03:09:31.507]  But before we get into that, I saw this couple of articles on the Drudge Report.
[03:09:31.527 --> 03:09:34.109]  I think he put these things right next to each other.
[03:09:34.530 --> 03:09:35.611]  Listen to these two headlines.
[03:09:36.251 --> 03:09:43.538]  World astrologists gather to predict the president and then more dead voters and fraud cases discovered in Colorado.
[03:09:44.499 --> 03:09:45.780]  So I guess the question is,
[03:09:46.917 --> 03:09:51.019]  Are CNN and Fox News going to start having seances to pull the dead?
[03:09:51.599 --> 03:09:55.161]  Because that's the situation we're in with voter fraud.
[03:09:55.702 --> 03:09:59.404]  It's not just in Colorado, but we're seeing this a lot in Virginia.
[03:09:59.424 --> 03:10:00.744]  We've had a couple of different articles.
[03:10:01.385 --> 03:10:09.749]  One particular county where one person who was working in the county office noticed a name that was going by there that was a deceased judge and said, wait a minute.
[03:10:10.629 --> 03:10:11.309]  I know that guy.
[03:10:11.329 --> 03:10:12.410]  And he's dead.
[03:10:13.151 --> 03:10:14.632]  And he's now registering to vote.
[03:10:14.692 --> 03:10:15.592]  What's going on with this?
[03:10:15.612 --> 03:10:16.793]  So I started looking at it carefully.
[03:10:16.833 --> 03:10:18.274]  They saw a whole bunch of people there.
[03:10:18.714 --> 03:10:22.336]  And then we've seen thousands show up in another area of Virginia.
[03:10:22.417 --> 03:10:24.298]  And that's only one small area of Virginia.
[03:10:24.358 --> 03:10:25.899]  And that's only one state.
[03:10:26.739 --> 03:10:33.384]  And as I've pointed out before, I know from second-hand information, a friend of my brother-in-law,
[03:10:34.372 --> 03:10:38.293]  Who, in the last election, 2012, went in to vote, and they said, you've already voted.
[03:10:38.333 --> 03:10:40.753]  Because, you know, in North Carolina, there's no voter ID.
[03:10:41.353 --> 03:10:43.134]  You can't have a picture ID they can't ask for.
[03:10:43.154 --> 03:10:45.914]  All you do is go in and give them a name and an address, and you can vote.
[03:10:46.835 --> 03:10:49.895]  And so they said, you voted, and so has this other person at your address.
[03:10:50.315 --> 03:10:51.415]  He says, well, that's my mother.
[03:10:52.036 --> 03:10:53.376]  She's been dead for a couple of years.
[03:10:53.996 --> 03:11:04.098]  So somebody had already gone in and voted for him and for his mother by the time it came to election day, because North Carolina starts voting earlier than any other state in the nation.
[03:11:04.318 --> 03:11:06.880]  See, North Carolina was run for a very long time by the Democrats.
[03:11:06.940 --> 03:11:09.001]  It's only recently the Republicans have taken over.
[03:11:09.502 --> 03:11:16.426]  They've tried to reform this drawn-out election process, the easy voter registration, the lack of voter ID.
[03:11:16.446 --> 03:11:18.047]  They've tried to address that.
[03:11:18.067 --> 03:11:27.194]  But every time they say, we're going to look at voter ID, then they come in after them and they say, no, no, no, you're not going to do that.
[03:11:28.188 --> 03:11:32.771]  That's racist to ask for ID, even though you have to show ID everywhere.
[03:11:32.811 --> 03:11:37.093]  So these two articles, one of them is an investigation by CBS in Colorado.
[03:11:37.954 --> 03:11:41.996]  The person who was looking at it, the county clerk's office, says, well, I don't think it was an accident.
[03:11:42.016 --> 03:11:46.219]  This is part of an investigation done by CBS entitled, Dying to Vote.
[03:11:47.820 --> 03:11:50.141]  That's the way it breaks out.
[03:11:50.742 --> 03:11:52.102]  And then the Guardian story.
[03:11:52.683 --> 03:11:54.384]  Astrologers are predicting the election.
[03:11:54.904 --> 03:11:59.046]  Dozens of astrologers are coming together to predict who will be president.
[03:11:59.106 --> 03:12:10.292]  So, I guess next we're going to see Frank Lunds in with an astrologer and they're going to be actually doing a Ouija board or whatever to figure out how these dead voters are going to be voting.
[03:12:11.352 --> 03:12:14.675]  Because, you know, that's just as scientific as their polls, isn't it?
[03:12:15.255 --> 03:12:25.202]  Their polls are just... When you've got polls, they tell you the margin of error is four points, and you get one poll after the other that are eight points apart or twelve points apart, okay?
[03:12:25.223 --> 03:12:28.865]  You can't even take the two and add them up and get the...
[03:12:30.086 --> 03:12:31.707]  The margin of error, it's so far apart.
[03:12:32.128 --> 03:12:39.453]  When they're heavily skewing it towards Democrat voters, far more than the difference between registered Democrats and registered Republicans.
[03:12:39.774 --> 03:12:52.763]  When they don't take into consideration the people who are coming into the election process who haven't voted for many, many years, if ever, because they've been totally fed up with these controlled opposition parties.
[03:12:54.064 --> 03:12:58.665]  The Bushes and the Clintons illustrate for us all how there really isn't two different parties.
[03:12:58.685 --> 03:12:59.906]  There hasn't really been a choice.
[03:13:00.426 --> 03:13:03.547]  It's simply been the American League versus the National League.
[03:13:03.627 --> 03:13:05.968]  Or the AFC versus the NFC.
[03:13:05.988 --> 03:13:08.308]  They're all playing for the same owners.
[03:13:09.289 --> 03:13:10.669]  And it's just phony opposition.
[03:13:10.709 --> 03:13:11.349]  It is a game.
[03:13:11.609 --> 03:13:12.049]  It is a game.
[03:13:12.109 --> 03:13:14.770]  And there is some benefit for the people who win.
[03:13:14.950 --> 03:13:17.211]  Just like there's a benefit for the team that wins the Super Bowl.
[03:13:17.932 --> 03:13:22.194]  But you have to understand that they are still going to be controlled.
[03:13:22.274 --> 03:13:24.055]  They've got other people who are making the rules.
[03:13:24.075 --> 03:13:25.415]  They're going to follow those rules.
[03:13:25.816 --> 03:13:30.498]  They're just the faces of this global governance that's there.
[03:13:30.538 --> 03:13:45.565]  And I think that when we look at some of these remarks that came out, the speeches that Hillary Clinton was making to these various banking groups, for which she was getting about a quarter of a million dollars apiece, for which she earned tens of millions of dollars,
[03:13:46.607 --> 03:13:50.089]  Essentially going to these people and saying, I know precisely what you want.
[03:13:50.670 --> 03:13:51.831]  We're on the same page.
[03:13:52.611 --> 03:13:55.673]  Give me the money, put me in office, I'll make it happen.
[03:13:56.374 --> 03:14:04.379]  And we look at this one particular comment here, and Donald Trump, I want to tell you what Donald Trump did to unpack this for his audience, because we've talked about this before.
[03:14:04.419 --> 03:14:05.300]  Here's the quote.
[03:14:05.800 --> 03:14:10.904]  My dream, she said to a group of bankers, is a hemispheric common market.
[03:14:11.664 --> 03:14:15.087]  With open trade and open borders sometime in the future.
[03:14:15.467 --> 03:14:18.369]  With energy that's as green and sustainable as we can get it.
[03:14:18.429 --> 03:14:21.512]  Powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.
[03:14:22.625 --> 03:14:32.614]  Now, I've said many times, and we've all said here at InfoWars.com, there's three different approaches that they're going to take in order to create a global governance.
[03:14:32.754 --> 03:14:34.856]  First of all, you get rid of the borders.
[03:14:35.837 --> 03:14:41.222]  And you homogenize the people, in one sense, to a third world level.
[03:14:41.262 --> 03:14:44.745]  You create different, bring in different groups that aren't going to assimilate.
[03:14:45.165 --> 03:14:46.847]  That's one of the ways that you destroy
[03:14:47.727 --> 03:14:59.976]  Uh, the national culture, and so what they're trying to do is homogenize on an international level, make all the countries the same, create conflict with groups that will not assimilate, like the massive groups of Muslims that come in.
[03:15:00.536 --> 03:15:02.837]  So that's one part of it, the open borders, okay?
[03:15:02.877 --> 03:15:10.743]  And we can see that with policies like the Dreamer policies, and the fact that they go apoplectic, even the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson.
[03:15:11.423 --> 03:15:14.266]  Freaking out when people use the term illegal immigrants.
[03:15:14.346 --> 03:15:15.827]  No, no, no, there's no such thing as illegals.
[03:15:15.867 --> 03:15:22.874]  And we got Nancy Pelosi saying, we don't have borders, we just have one people with a line running through us.
[03:15:22.954 --> 03:15:26.437]  It's no different than the border between, let's say, Oklahoma and Texas.
[03:15:26.477 --> 03:15:27.818]  Because in their mind,
[03:15:28.519 --> 03:15:31.802]  They have already created a hemispheric common market.
[03:15:31.902 --> 03:15:34.624]  She's just acknowledging what they've been working for for a long time.
[03:15:35.224 --> 03:15:36.465]  NAFTA was the first part of it.
[03:15:36.565 --> 03:15:41.429]  First you create economic consolidation and economic management.
[03:15:41.569 --> 03:15:47.033]  And then what you do is you create political consolidation.
[03:15:47.273 --> 03:15:47.534]  Okay?
[03:15:47.914 --> 03:15:49.975]  And that's what's happening with this.
[03:15:52.506 --> 03:15:59.232]  The open borders are part of this, and the other part of it is what they call open trade, or free trade.
[03:15:59.913 --> 03:16:05.418]  That really is not free trade, it's really managed trade, and we've talked about that as well.
[03:16:05.458 --> 03:16:13.845]  That's what TPP and the TTIP, the Transatlantic, the Trans-Pacific Partnerships, and understand they don't even call them trade agreements anymore.
[03:16:14.345 --> 03:16:15.687]  NAFTA was a treaty.
[03:16:16.854 --> 03:16:19.195]  They don't call it a treaty, they call it a trade agreement.
[03:16:19.376 --> 03:16:20.176]  But it was a treaty.
[03:16:20.816 --> 03:16:22.077]  TPP is a treaty.
[03:16:22.537 --> 03:16:24.398]  So is TTIP.
[03:16:24.559 --> 03:16:25.739]  Those are both treaties.
[03:16:25.899 --> 03:16:26.200]  And yet...
[03:16:27.130 --> 03:16:34.676]  The reality is, is that they want to call them something other than a treaty, so they don't have to follow the constitutional process for ratifying a treaty.
[03:16:35.437 --> 03:16:37.138]  But you have to understand, this isn't about free trade.
[03:16:37.178 --> 03:16:38.219]  It's not about open trade.
[03:16:38.519 --> 03:16:46.746]  This is about having our economy managed by a committee, an international committee, that is not elected, that is not accountable to anyone.
[03:16:47.246 --> 03:16:47.566]  Okay?
[03:16:47.606 --> 03:16:55.353]  This is worse than the Central Planning Committee of the communist countries that would get together and do the economic planning with a five-year plan.
[03:16:56.013 --> 03:16:59.174]  This is precisely how these trade agreements were created in the first place.
[03:16:59.734 --> 03:17:09.297]  And as Senator Sessions pointed out, the only senator to go in and really read and study and analyze and present what these treaties were about, it is a living document.
[03:17:09.697 --> 03:17:15.958]  It creates a committee that can, by fiat, change anything in it, including the people who are included in it.
[03:17:15.978 --> 03:17:16.819]  They can bring in China.
[03:17:16.839 --> 03:17:18.659]  This is not a bulwark against China.
[03:17:19.459 --> 03:17:21.240]  And as Jeff Sessions pointed out,
[03:17:21.920 --> 03:17:23.942]  They are going to be managing our economy.
[03:17:24.022 --> 03:17:26.043]  Nobody is going to be electing these people.
[03:17:26.263 --> 03:17:27.184]  How do they get appointed?
[03:17:27.925 --> 03:17:28.505]  Ask yourself.
[03:17:29.206 --> 03:17:31.247]  Well, ask yourself who wrote these agreements.
[03:17:32.048 --> 03:17:34.910]  Your elected representatives, and every one of these countries affected.
[03:17:35.010 --> 03:17:37.112]  Not just in America, but all of the countries.
[03:17:37.833 --> 03:17:40.615]  The elected representatives couldn't even look at this stuff.
[03:17:41.656 --> 03:17:53.444]  And then they're told afterwards, and these are the people, Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, all these people who are dumping on Trump, who say they can't support him, they're not going to do anything to help him, they're not supporting America.
[03:17:53.965 --> 03:18:02.551]  These are the same people who, after they were hand-delivered this agreement that was created by a few multinational corporations' lobbyists,
[03:18:03.331 --> 03:18:10.556]  They said we're going to ram this thing through without any kind of debate, without filibuster, without delay.
[03:18:10.796 --> 03:18:14.098]  Once they present this thing, it's going to run through in 20 days.
[03:18:14.559 --> 03:18:18.561]  There will be no amendments, no debate about any of this stuff.
[03:18:18.601 --> 03:18:24.705]  Just going to be a straight up and down vote, and it's going to be a majority vote, not a two-thirds vote like is required in the Constitution.
[03:18:24.725 --> 03:18:32.991]  So we have the open borders, we have the so-called open trade, which is globalist management of your economy, and then we have
[03:18:33.892 --> 03:18:35.113]  The sustainable aspect.
[03:18:35.153 --> 03:18:36.154]  The climate treaty.
[03:18:36.254 --> 03:18:38.196]  This is what Hillary Clinton finishes up with.
[03:18:38.556 --> 03:18:40.198]  Oh, we're going to be green and sustainable.
[03:18:40.919 --> 03:18:46.425]  You understand, that is perhaps the most powerful aspect of global governance.
[03:18:47.366 --> 03:18:50.849]  Look at the UN agenda for 2030 of sustainable development.
[03:18:51.770 --> 03:18:53.272]  Okay, what they're talking about there.
[03:18:54.560 --> 03:18:59.262]  is essentially creating a global tax that is going to fund a global governance.
[03:18:59.722 --> 03:19:04.284]  You have to have a global problem that a global government is going to address.
[03:19:04.364 --> 03:19:07.246]  So they invented climate change.
[03:19:07.826 --> 03:19:14.469]  And then they invented a crony capitalist system to do this, which is also a tax which will fund this global governance.
[03:19:15.069 --> 03:19:18.471]  by these multinational corporations that are writing these treaties.
[03:19:19.091 --> 03:19:22.172]  All three of those things are right there in Hillary Clinton's remarks.
[03:19:22.192 --> 03:19:24.633]  Now here's the way Donald Trump broke it down yesterday.
[03:19:25.534 --> 03:19:29.776]  First of all, he said we have to investigate Hillary Clinton and we have to investigate the investigation.
[03:19:30.339 --> 03:19:38.704]  In other words, we're going to find out, and we're going to find out, he knows that Comey and Lynch were coordinating with the Clinton campaign.
[03:19:39.304 --> 03:19:42.486]  We see now more emails confirming that, but we told you that before.
[03:19:42.506 --> 03:19:46.208]  We told you about the relationship between Comey and between Lynch.
[03:19:46.348 --> 03:19:53.452]  Now that's been going on for a long time, that they let Sandy Berger get away with destroying national security documents in a cover-up.
[03:19:53.872 --> 03:19:55.313]  Hillary Clinton is desperate.
[03:20:22.441 --> 03:20:30.388]  Donald Trump was 10 points ahead in the polls until Reuters and others began sampling 10 to 15 percent more Democrats in their polls to skew the numbers.
[03:20:30.689 --> 03:20:31.249]  It's incredible.
[03:20:31.529 --> 03:20:40.738]  But despite all that skewing in the last two weeks, now in major polls, put up with the very same groups, with the same methodology, Trump is neck and neck with her, or even a point or two ahead.
[03:20:41.238 --> 03:20:46.663]  But if you go look at the social media, and Breitbart and Gateway Pundit have done this, it's incredible.
[03:20:47.364 --> 03:20:56.687]  We're talking 3, 4, 5, 6 times the support at places like Facebook, Livestream, Reddit, and so many other places.
[03:20:56.927 --> 03:21:00.808]  In fact, sometimes he's got 10 times more likes and 10 times more views.
[03:21:01.469 --> 03:21:04.950]  That's what we saw with Bernie Sanders, where he'd have 20,000 people, Hillary'd have 500.
[03:21:06.030 --> 03:21:10.173]  We did exit polls in California and other so-called battleground states in the Democratic primary.
[03:21:10.533 --> 03:21:14.676]  And we talked to eight people before we found one or two Hillary supporters.
[03:21:15.236 --> 03:21:18.459]  That's why Hillary was forced to steal it with the superdelegates.
[03:21:19.139 --> 03:21:20.720]  Let's look at some of the numbers themselves.
[03:21:21.641 --> 03:21:26.524]  Trump had 10 million plus likes to Clinton's 5 million on Facebook.
[03:21:26.904 --> 03:21:34.710]  And that's with Facebook admittedly censoring Trump pages everywhere they can and even meeting with Hillary Clinton just like Google does.
[03:21:35.652 --> 03:21:43.498]  Trump averages 30,000 live viewers per stream, and Clinton averages 500 live stream viewers per stream.
[03:21:43.938 --> 03:21:48.341]  On Reddit, Trump averages 197,000 plus subscribers, Hillary 24,000.
[03:21:48.821 --> 03:21:53.264]  Hillary for prison has 55,000 subscribers.
[03:21:53.525 --> 03:21:54.805]  Gee, wonder who started that.
[03:21:55.406 --> 03:21:59.409]  And this is only a snapshot of the numbers we're seeing with Trump.
[03:21:59.829 --> 03:22:03.371]  You go to YouTube, his average video has millions of views.
[03:22:04.412 --> 03:22:06.813]  You go look at Hillary's official campaign site.
[03:22:07.373 --> 03:22:09.293]  Most of her videos have 2,000 or 3,000 views.
[03:22:09.353 --> 03:22:10.814]  Her bigger one's a few hundred thousand.
[03:22:11.154 --> 03:22:12.294]  This lady's a joke.
[03:22:12.694 --> 03:22:14.035]  She's not liked by her own party.
[03:22:14.335 --> 03:22:20.997]  But we're being told it's going to be a landslide for her because they're trying to get us ready for election fraud.
[03:22:21.397 --> 03:22:24.498]  Something so well documented in this country's past.
[03:22:25.711 --> 03:22:30.034]  But Obama says, it's preposterous, he doesn't even know what that is.
[03:22:30.835 --> 03:22:32.817]  Well, President Obama, we do know what it is.
[03:22:33.597 --> 03:22:39.482]  And this time, we don't have somebody like Mitt Romney or John McCain who's going to stand down and not take action.
[03:22:39.782 --> 03:22:41.944]  We don't have somebody who's going to throw in the towel there's fraud.
[03:22:42.204 --> 03:22:46.467]  We've got Donald Trump and an awake population that's aware of your scams.
[03:22:47.523 --> 03:22:49.205]  The social engineers have jumped the shark.
[03:22:49.605 --> 03:22:51.607]  They are stealing this election in front of everyone.
[03:22:52.507 --> 03:22:56.331]  By forcing them to engage in fraud, we are exposing them forever.
[03:22:56.651 --> 03:23:11.984]  So even if Donald Trump loses, even if that happens due to fraud or scandals, it doesn't matter because we've been in the arena, we've politically exposed the system, political correctness, globalism, the maxim has been introduced, Americanism, not globalism.
[03:23:12.810 --> 03:23:14.871]  This is a good time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:23:15.251 --> 03:23:21.313]  And we owe Donald Trump so much for being willing to put his family, his life, his treasure on the line.
[03:23:21.734 --> 03:23:22.974]  He is the man in the arena.
[03:23:23.554 --> 03:23:25.315]  And I'm honored to be in that arena with him as well.
[03:23:25.795 --> 03:23:30.377]  If you haven't joined us in this historic fight, it's time to pick a side right now.

[03:23:43.152 --> 03:23:44.533]  He's a conspiracy theorist.

[03:23:47.535 --> 03:23:48.356]  Alex Jones.
[03:23:48.436 --> 03:23:51.198]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[03:23:51.258 --> 03:23:54.460]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[03:23:54.480 --> 03:23:55.801]  Deeply, I think, racist.
[03:23:55.921 --> 03:23:57.763]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[03:23:57.863 --> 03:23:59.664]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[03:23:59.684 --> 03:24:03.767]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!

[03:26:21.542 --> 03:26:24.384]  Now, I want to go back to this speech that Donald Trump gave yesterday.
[03:26:25.565 --> 03:26:28.286]  This was in Florida, Tuesday night.
[03:26:28.306 --> 03:26:29.607]  He had about 8,000 people.
[03:26:30.007 --> 03:26:32.749]  As I mentioned before we went to the break, he said, we have to investigate Hillary Clinton.
[03:26:32.769 --> 03:26:35.550]  We have to investigate the investigation, he said.
[03:26:36.290 --> 03:26:38.651]  And he went on to call her a carpet-bagging U.S.
[03:26:38.671 --> 03:26:39.652]  Senator from New York.
[03:26:40.152 --> 03:26:42.153]  Yeah, that's exactly what she is.
[03:26:42.193 --> 03:26:43.734]  She's gone both different directions.
[03:26:44.094 --> 03:26:48.016]  She's carpet-bagging going from north to south and from south to north.
[03:26:49.317 --> 03:27:03.451]  They said, by the time the crowd estimated that 8,000 filed back to their cars, this is Daily Mail, he had accused her of secretly plotting to eliminate America's national borders in favor of a single global government with control over trade and immigration.
[03:27:04.184 --> 03:27:08.107]  Now, you have to understand, he didn't accuse her of this.
[03:27:08.588 --> 03:27:17.475]  What he read was her statement saying that that is her dream, that is her goal, and laying out the three tactics to achieve that, just as I pointed that out in the last segment.
[03:27:17.835 --> 03:27:27.783]  And then he goes on to say this, speaking in secret to a foreign bank, again, just revealed, Hillary said, my dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade, open borders.
[03:27:28.323 --> 03:27:31.904]  And he quoted a digest of previously undisclosed transcripts of speeches.
[03:27:31.964 --> 03:27:40.768]  These are the things that came out on Friday that were so damaging to Hillary Clinton that they came out with this locker room talk that Donald Trump had, the tape.
[03:27:40.808 --> 03:27:42.288]  And that's all that they wanted to talk about.
[03:27:42.348 --> 03:27:43.689]  That was the red herring.
[03:27:44.189 --> 03:27:50.651]  So you wouldn't pay attention to so many of the things that Hillary Clinton, that came out about Hillary Clinton in these speeches.
[03:27:50.711 --> 03:27:53.272]  He says, well, there goes the rest of your businesses, folks.
[03:27:53.752 --> 03:27:54.913]  There goes your country, folks.
[03:27:55.413 --> 03:28:04.241]  He said behind closed doors, this is Donald Trump talking about Hillary Clinton's admission that she wants a hemispheric, open trade, open borders.
[03:28:04.882 --> 03:28:05.843]  She wants a common market.
[03:28:05.883 --> 03:28:07.104]  She wants a North American Union.
[03:28:07.144 --> 03:28:11.869]  The North American Union that they always told us was a fantasy of the conspiracy theorists.
[03:28:12.249 --> 03:28:14.011]  No, she laid it out there in detail.
[03:28:14.551 --> 03:28:17.054]  And it's not going to stop with the North American Union.
[03:28:17.614 --> 03:28:19.335]  It's not going to stop with the European Union.
[03:28:19.735 --> 03:28:29.520]  They are combining those together with the TTIP, just as they are combining America with a governance of our economy with a TPP with Asian countries.
[03:28:30.180 --> 03:28:37.223]  He goes on, he says, behind closed doors, when she thought no one was listening, she pledged to dissolve the borders of the United States of America.
[03:28:37.584 --> 03:28:38.104]  No borders.
[03:28:38.624 --> 03:28:41.247]  And he goes on to say, if you don't have borders, you don't have a country.
[03:28:41.647 --> 03:28:54.940]  He said, WikiLeaks has given us a window into the secret corridors of government power where we see a former Secretary of State announcing her desire to end forever the American independence that our founders gave us and wanted us to have.
[03:28:54.980 --> 03:28:58.604]  He said, we're protecting the borders of foreign countries, but not our borders.
[03:28:59.324 --> 03:28:59.865]  Think about that.
[03:29:01.084 --> 03:29:13.096]  Think about the fact that we have our government all over the world fighting wars that have multiplied under the Obama administration, multiplied under Hillary Clinton's Secretary of State administration.
[03:29:14.008 --> 03:29:15.610]  We have set the Middle East on fire.
[03:29:15.850 --> 03:29:21.637]  We're abroad protecting the borders of foreign countries, said Donald Trump, but nobody is protecting our borders.
[03:29:21.697 --> 03:29:26.783]  These WikiLeaks emails confirm what those of us here today have known all along, he continued.
[03:29:27.303 --> 03:29:33.150]  Hillary Clinton is the vessel of a corrupt globalist establishment that's raiding our country.
[03:29:33.490 --> 03:29:35.150]  Surrendering the sovereignty of our nation.
[03:29:35.450 --> 03:29:45.593]  This criminal government cartel doesn't recognize borders, but believes in global governance, unlimited immigration, and rule by corporations.
[03:29:46.373 --> 03:29:59.576]  The few multinational corporations that have written the TPP and the TTIP and are handing it down to our people like Paul Ryano who will rubber stamp it through with a non-constitutional process.
[03:29:59.596 --> 03:30:00.276]  We'll be right back.
[03:30:00.597 --> 03:30:02.097]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.097 --> 03:30:05.900]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.683 --> 03:30:15.587]  Russia has ordered all of its officials to fly home, including any relatives living abroad.
[03:30:15.607 --> 03:30:19.811]  This news comes as tension mounts over the prospect of pending global war.
[03:30:19.831 --> 03:30:25.015]  A failure to heed the instruction could put promotion chances at risk, according to local reports from Moscow.
[03:30:25.435 --> 03:30:28.256]  This news comes amid worsening relations between Russia and the U.S.
[03:30:28.356 --> 03:30:29.076]  over Syria.
[03:30:29.236 --> 03:30:34.418]  Politicians and high-ranking figures are said to have received a direct warning from Russian President Vladimir Putin.
[03:30:34.538 --> 03:30:40.379]  This news comes as Putin has canceled a planned visit to France amid conflict over Moscow's role in the Syrian theater.
[03:30:40.559 --> 03:30:46.321]  Just days after this news emerged, the Kremlin has moved nuclear-capable missiles near the Polish border.
[03:30:46.521 --> 03:30:53.503]  Russian political analyst Stanislav Bilkowski said this is all part of a package of measures to prepare elites to some big war.
[03:30:53.823 --> 03:30:55.706]  Relations between Russia and the U.S.
[03:30:55.866 --> 03:30:59.531]  are at their lowest since the Cold War and continue to deteriorate.
[03:30:59.732 --> 03:31:06.942]  Even former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has warned the world is in a dangerous point due to rising tensions between Russia and the U.S.
[03:31:07.203 --> 03:31:09.286]  I'm Margaret Hal reporting for InfoWars.com
[03:31:10.327 --> 03:31:14.730]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[03:31:14.811 --> 03:31:25.739]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[03:31:25.899 --> 03:31:30.841]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[03:31:30.962 --> 03:31:33.463]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[03:31:33.523 --> 03:31:35.024]  It helps detoxify.
[03:31:35.244 --> 03:31:38.065]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[03:31:38.125 --> 03:31:42.868]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[03:31:42.888 --> 03:31:49.131]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[03:31:49.151 --> 03:31:54.473]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[03:31:54.593 --> 03:31:55.254]  I'm taking it now.
[03:31:55.794 --> 03:31:57.675]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:32:12.119 --> 03:32:13.399]  You can't survive without it.
[03:32:13.599 --> 03:32:14.500]  But where do you get it?
[03:32:14.800 --> 03:32:20.561]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[03:32:20.781 --> 03:32:26.523]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[03:32:26.703 --> 03:32:40.687]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants,
[03:32:41.027 --> 03:32:43.548]  Volatile organic contaminants and hormones.
[03:32:43.949 --> 03:32:46.090]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[03:32:46.450 --> 03:32:47.630]  Stainless steel construction.
[03:32:47.911 --> 03:32:48.611]  Easy assembly.
[03:32:48.951 --> 03:32:49.571]  Low maintenance.
[03:32:49.852 --> 03:32:51.693]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[03:33:21.286 --> 03:33:23.489]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[03:33:23.949 --> 03:33:26.412]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:33:26.953 --> 03:33:29.256]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:33:33.416 --> 03:33:34.677]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:34.697 --> 03:33:35.317]  I'm David Knight.
[03:33:35.978 --> 03:33:43.924]  You know, it's interesting to see the article saying that the Clinton campaign is losing patience with Bill Clinton rape protesters.
[03:33:43.964 --> 03:33:44.584]  Yeah, I bet they are.
[03:33:44.624 --> 03:33:46.485]  There's been five of them just today.
[03:33:46.505 --> 03:33:50.468]  This thing is going totally viral and they are freaking out.
[03:33:50.789 --> 03:33:55.552]  Look at the way the femdems, the hateful left, are replying to this.
[03:33:55.592 --> 03:33:59.115]  We've got, yesterday, Joy Behar on The View
[03:33:59.835 --> 03:34:03.416]  Suggesting this line for Hillary Clinton regarding those women.
[03:34:03.476 --> 03:34:08.678]  She said, I would like to apologize to those tramps that have slept with my husband.
[03:34:09.598 --> 03:34:10.278]  Oh, there you go.
[03:34:10.599 --> 03:34:11.599]  Calling them tramps.
[03:34:12.239 --> 03:34:19.421]  Okay, this is blurring the line, deliberately blurring the line between rape and consensual sex.
[03:34:20.762 --> 03:34:23.643]  Okay, Bill Clinton has had a lot of consensual sex.
[03:34:24.557 --> 03:34:28.878]  But what we're talking about with Juanita Broderick and others is rape.
[03:34:29.698 --> 03:34:31.219]  You have to understand the difference.
[03:34:31.679 --> 03:34:34.740]  And these feminists who say they're all about women.
[03:34:35.160 --> 03:34:36.780]  No, they're about Hillary Clinton.
[03:34:37.341 --> 03:34:39.061]  Hillary Clinton is not about women.
[03:34:39.101 --> 03:34:40.902]  Hillary Clinton is for herself.
[03:34:41.282 --> 03:34:42.022]  She's not with you.
[03:34:42.842 --> 03:34:55.371]  If you're with her, you're being duped into voting for a phony feminist who hates women, who get in her way, and will destroy them by any means necessary, including covering up for her raping husband.
[03:34:56.131 --> 03:35:03.016]  Joy Behar then apologized the next show and says, I never intended to belittle sexual assault.
[03:35:03.556 --> 03:35:04.657]  And the women who are victims.
[03:35:05.197 --> 03:35:05.657]  Oh, really?
[03:35:05.677 --> 03:35:06.498]  Oh, really?
[03:35:06.778 --> 03:35:08.019]  So you just call them tramps?
[03:35:08.359 --> 03:35:13.682]  Isn't that usually the tactic that is taken against women who accuse someone of rape?
[03:35:14.462 --> 03:35:18.084]  They're always attacked as tramps, aren't they, Joy?
[03:35:18.905 --> 03:35:26.129]  People like you have always attacked and destroyed the character of people who come out and talk about rape.
[03:35:26.509 --> 03:35:27.710]  That's what we saw with the guy
[03:35:28.769 --> 03:35:35.654]  Who just did Birth of a Nation, Nate Parker, and the other guy that was with him.
[03:35:35.734 --> 03:35:37.175]  Both of them were accused of rape.
[03:35:37.215 --> 03:35:44.900]  The other guy was convicted and eventually let off on a technicality on appeal, just like Hillary Clinton began her political career.
[03:35:45.200 --> 03:35:52.185]  That's the way she began her political career, getting off a child rapist on a technicality and cackling about it.
[03:35:52.505 --> 03:35:53.846]  We've all heard the tape, haven't we?
[03:35:54.366 --> 03:35:57.908]  But Joy Behar says, well, I wouldn't want to ever belittle sexual assault.
[03:35:57.928 --> 03:35:58.529]  Well, you just did.
[03:35:59.129 --> 03:35:59.670]  You just did.
[03:36:00.070 --> 03:36:12.379]  You just belittled multiple people who have been sexually assaulted by a serial rapist because it gets in the way of your political ambitions for the person that you really care about, Hillary Clinton.
[03:36:12.399 --> 03:36:13.579]  You don't care about women in general.
[03:36:13.779 --> 03:36:14.980]  You don't care about women's rights.
[03:36:15.341 --> 03:36:17.262]  And that includes Whoopi Goldberg as well.
[03:36:17.542 --> 03:36:20.064]  They blurred the line on Monday's broadcast of The View.
[03:36:20.584 --> 03:36:27.129]  They blurred the lines between women who had had consensual affairs with Mr. Clinton and those who accused him of sexual assault.
[03:36:28.255 --> 03:36:32.756]  And then she comes back and says, well, I want to apologize for that.
[03:36:32.816 --> 03:36:34.056]  Well, it's a bit too late, I think.
[03:36:34.656 --> 03:36:36.337]  And that was an article from the Washington Times.
[03:36:37.117 --> 03:36:39.578]  Look at what happened then on CNN.
[03:36:39.938 --> 03:36:41.658]  Here's another one of the fem-dems.
[03:36:41.978 --> 03:36:43.278]  Another one of the hateful left.
[03:36:43.418 --> 03:36:45.799]  CNN panelists, this is on Infowars.com.
[03:36:46.679 --> 03:36:49.820]  Bill Clinton rape allegations are effing ridiculous, dude.
[03:36:50.740 --> 03:36:58.405]  She just goes off on a rant, swearing, you know, using harmful language that we're supposed to get upset about, you know, like Donald Trump.
[03:36:59.166 --> 03:37:08.332]  CNN panelists dismissed Bill Clinton's documented history of sexual abuse against women as effing ridiculous dude on a broadcast of Erin Burnett out front.
[03:37:08.993 --> 03:37:09.173]  Yeah.
[03:37:09.973 --> 03:37:10.973]  Yeah, you're up front, alright.
[03:37:11.394 --> 03:37:21.116]  As the networks continue to cover for the Clintons while devoting vast swaths of airtime to Trump's locker room banter tape from 2005, this is an article by Steve Watson.
[03:37:21.617 --> 03:37:24.157]  He writes, the person who said this was Angela Rye.
[03:37:24.177 --> 03:37:35.961]  She went absolutely crazy, almost yelled obscenities when the conservative member of the panel brought up documented accounts of Hillary Clinton's attacks on the women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual abuse.
[03:37:36.863 --> 03:37:37.263]  No, she didn't!
[03:37:37.303 --> 03:37:37.724]  No, she didn't!
[03:37:38.184 --> 03:37:38.625]  She... What?
[03:37:38.805 --> 03:37:39.005]  How?
[03:37:39.125 --> 03:37:40.727]  How did she facilitate it when she wasn't?
[03:37:40.907 --> 03:37:44.310]  She goes on and on with this and just freaks out if you look at the transcript.
[03:37:44.330 --> 03:37:47.713]  She just says... She says no five times and... No, no, no, no, no!
[03:37:47.974 --> 03:37:50.176]  Because it's not... It's rape culture, Kayleigh.
[03:37:50.196 --> 03:37:52.618]  You're blaming someone who succumbed to committing adultery on her.
[03:37:52.658 --> 03:37:54.940]  We're Christians, so let's talk about what this is.
[03:37:55.200 --> 03:37:55.521]  Okay.
[03:37:56.161 --> 03:37:59.224]  So, this is the way this is rolling over and over again.
[03:37:59.504 --> 03:38:01.927]  They absolutely can't handle this.
[03:38:02.387 --> 03:38:04.289]  And this campaign is going viral.
[03:38:04.769 --> 03:38:06.271]  But take a look at the other ways.
[03:38:06.291 --> 03:38:09.514]  This is always the way the left handles everything.
[03:38:09.674 --> 03:38:10.655]  With censorship.
[03:38:11.195 --> 03:38:12.216]  With punishment.
[03:38:12.737 --> 03:38:13.918]  Look at Canada, for example.
[03:38:14.841 --> 03:38:16.282]  We have a European Parliament member.
[03:38:16.883 --> 03:38:17.623]  Go to Canada.
[03:38:17.683 --> 03:38:19.185]  He's a French activist.
[03:38:19.945 --> 03:38:22.147]  He's an anti-globalization activist.
[03:38:22.187 --> 03:38:24.910]  His name is Jose Bové, if I'm pronouncing that correctly.
[03:38:25.550 --> 03:38:34.678]  He was told to leave Canada by today, preventing him from speaking at an event that would oppose a planned EU-Canada free trade deal.
[03:38:34.718 --> 03:38:35.239]  See, it isn't
[03:38:35.859 --> 03:38:37.600]  Just the TTIP.
[03:38:38.000 --> 03:38:42.383]  It isn't things just like NAFTA, TPP and others.
[03:38:42.443 --> 03:38:47.186]  The Canadians have their own free trade deal which is consolidating all this.
[03:38:47.306 --> 03:38:51.969]  And it is not simply because they don't want free trade and open markets.
[03:38:52.129 --> 03:38:54.210]  It isn't about free trade and open markets.
[03:38:54.230 --> 03:38:58.513]  And when the Republicans or Libertarians tell you that it's about free trade,
[03:38:59.113 --> 03:39:01.015]  You really are being deceived.
[03:39:01.175 --> 03:39:02.237]  You really need to look at this.
[03:39:02.317 --> 03:39:05.000]  It's about so much more than even the economics behind it.
[03:39:05.060 --> 03:39:07.843]  It's also about the freedom of the Internet.
[03:39:08.423 --> 03:39:12.428]  And it's also about the freedom to make your own laws about the environment.
[03:39:12.468 --> 03:39:13.950]  Now, I would disagree with this guy.
[03:39:14.010 --> 03:39:15.812]  He's a green candidate.
[03:39:16.172 --> 03:39:17.033]  I would disagree with him.
[03:39:17.073 --> 03:39:37.481]  But I think we ought to be able to make that decision with elected representatives, country by country, not have that decision made for us by some corporate global entity that is going to dictate the terms of our economy to us and tell us precisely who's going to be allowed to have factories and who isn't, and how those factories are going to be fueled and how they're not going to be fueled.
[03:39:38.021 --> 03:39:42.663]  It was a Council of Canadians, listen to this, a social justice non-profit.
[03:39:43.063 --> 03:39:45.164]  It's always the social justice people, right?
[03:39:45.664 --> 03:39:52.006]  It's the social justice people who scream in your face, just like this person yesterday on CNN.
[03:39:52.606 --> 03:39:59.508]  They just get in your face and scream and shut you down, censor you, take you off the air, and shout you down.
[03:39:59.828 --> 03:40:10.131]  They denied entry to this guy ahead of a public forum that the group had organized on the Canadian-EU Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement, CETA.
[03:40:10.973 --> 03:40:12.074]  See, it's happening everywhere.
[03:40:12.695 --> 03:40:13.676]  They don't want debate.
[03:40:14.057 --> 03:40:16.039]  They don't want people to know what this is.
[03:40:16.459 --> 03:40:17.601]  So they shut you down.
[03:40:17.941 --> 03:40:19.022]  They deport you.
[03:40:20.344 --> 03:40:21.085]  And that's what they're doing.
[03:40:21.185 --> 03:40:23.327]  They're actually throwing this guy out of the country.
[03:40:24.008 --> 03:40:24.568]  Out of the country.
[03:40:25.635 --> 03:40:26.976]  And he's coming from the EU.
[03:40:26.996 --> 03:40:29.037]  This is a trade deal between the EU and Canada.
[03:40:29.057 --> 03:40:35.840]  And he's coming back and saying, let me tell you why you don't want to surrender your authority to some transnational committee.
[03:40:35.860 --> 03:40:37.541]  And he said, you're leaving the country.
[03:40:37.561 --> 03:40:38.201]  We're throwing you out.
[03:40:38.281 --> 03:40:40.282]  You're not even going to be allowed to talk about this.
[03:40:40.882 --> 03:40:42.603]  This is what we're seeing everywhere.
[03:40:43.624 --> 03:40:47.986]  As Donald Trump was saying yesterday, and let me read this quote to you again, because I think this is key.
[03:40:48.026 --> 03:40:51.908]  This is like his Americanism versus globalism.
[03:40:52.825 --> 03:40:54.406]  This is what he had to say.
[03:40:55.046 --> 03:40:58.067]  He said, Hillary Clinton is a vessel of a corrupt global establishment.
[03:40:58.087 --> 03:40:58.828]  I'll read this to you again.
[03:40:58.908 --> 03:41:01.769]  It's raiding our country, surrendering the sovereignty of our nation.
[03:41:02.169 --> 03:41:12.333]  The criminal government cartel doesn't recognize borders, but believes in global governance, unlimited immigration, and rule by corporations.
[03:41:12.633 --> 03:41:13.094]  You understand?
[03:41:14.062 --> 03:41:18.986]  It's a global government ruled by corporations, and they don't believe in borders.
[03:41:19.286 --> 03:41:20.828]  And here's more evidence of this.
[03:41:21.548 --> 03:41:26.492]  The feds will press criminal contempt charges against Sheriff Arpaio.
[03:41:27.813 --> 03:41:27.994]  Okay?
[03:41:28.034 --> 03:41:36.020]  The federal government has charged Sheriff Arpaio, says the RT, with criminal contempt charges for violating a judge's order to stop immigration patrols.
[03:41:37.241 --> 03:41:37.501]  Alright?
[03:41:38.022 --> 03:41:41.204]  Now, if convicted, he could spend six months in jail.
[03:41:41.765 --> 03:41:42.726]  So here's the situation.
[03:41:43.899 --> 03:41:45.980]  We're going to jail law enforcement.
[03:41:46.541 --> 03:41:50.323]  We're going to jail the people who try to enforce our border laws.
[03:41:50.343 --> 03:41:56.127]  We've already had Obama handcuff, metaphorically handcuff, the Border Patrol.
[03:41:56.167 --> 03:42:01.190]  Now they are going to literally jail Sheriff Arpaio for patrolling the borders.
[03:42:02.150 --> 03:42:04.872]  That's why the Border Patrol supports Donald Trump.
[03:42:05.392 --> 03:42:08.494]  That's why Sheriff Arpaio supports Donald Trump.
[03:42:09.074 --> 03:42:13.037]  He's trying to enforce the law that Barack Obama doesn't care about.
[03:42:14.654 --> 03:42:18.276]  And Barack Obama is shutting down law enforcement, is going to jail this sheriff.
[03:42:18.976 --> 03:42:27.540]  And the group that is protesting the sheriff, their slogan here is, arrest Arpaio, not the people.
[03:42:28.180 --> 03:42:32.762]  Well, if the people are here illegally, and if they're violating our laws, they need to be arrested.
[03:42:33.243 --> 03:42:35.864]  You don't arrest someone who is enforcing our laws.
[03:42:35.924 --> 03:42:39.966]  But that's the way the Obama administration has turned this upside down.
[03:42:40.546 --> 03:42:42.407]  And as they were doing this, this group,
[03:42:43.047 --> 03:42:46.109]  Saying arrest the sheriff, not the people.
[03:42:46.809 --> 03:42:47.069]  Okay?
[03:42:47.129 --> 03:42:48.670]  Arrest Arpaio, not the people.
[03:42:49.230 --> 03:42:49.490]  Okay?
[03:42:49.510 --> 03:42:53.752]  They're chanting outside the courthouse, a couple of dozen protesters.
[03:42:53.892 --> 03:42:56.734]  In Spanish, they're chanting, yes we can.
[03:42:57.554 --> 03:42:58.055]  Yes we can.
[03:42:58.075 --> 03:43:02.337]  It's Obama that is destroying our country and it is
[03:43:03.197 --> 03:43:10.464]  His work that is going to be continued by Hillary Clinton and you have to understand that it is for the benefit of the banks.
[03:43:11.144 --> 03:43:12.285]  This is precisely what they're doing.
[03:43:12.305 --> 03:43:21.874]  Now we had Hillary Clinton come out and we've talked about the fact that she said that we are going to have appropriate responses to cyber hacking.
[03:43:21.894 --> 03:43:26.879]  We're going to have political and economic and military responses to cyber hacking.
[03:43:26.899 --> 03:43:27.880]  Think about that for a moment.
[03:43:28.919 --> 03:43:44.543]  When you look at all of these wild conspiracy theories that were thrown out about how it was the Russians who were releasing information that embarrassed Hillary Clinton at the Democrat National Convention, when you look at every time something comes out they say the Russians did it, the Russians did it.
[03:43:44.563 --> 03:43:47.083]  Okay, they have not proved that.
[03:43:48.584 --> 03:43:52.045]  And even if that were true, you and I would never be able to vet that.
[03:43:52.185 --> 03:43:56.926]  It is the ultimate false flag if you're going to use that to start a war.
[03:43:58.038 --> 03:44:04.020]  And understand that when you create economic sanctions against a country, that is the first stage towards war.
[03:44:04.320 --> 03:44:06.461]  And that's what we're doing right now against Russia.
[03:44:07.461 --> 03:44:11.923]  But they're talking about military strikes in response to cyber hacks.
[03:44:13.183 --> 03:44:15.004]  Do you realize how dangerous that is?
[03:44:15.064 --> 03:44:18.525]  That is the ultimate false flag technique.
[03:44:19.758 --> 03:44:22.941]  We have to take their word that there was a cyber hack in the first place.
[03:44:23.121 --> 03:44:31.508]  We don't even know in some of these cases if they say, well, somebody hacked into our personnel files or whatever and the federal government got all of our...
[03:44:32.421 --> 03:44:34.142]  Our federal employees personnel file.
[03:44:34.242 --> 03:44:36.544]  So we don't know for sure that happened.
[03:44:36.564 --> 03:44:38.445]  We're taking their word for it that it happened.
[03:44:38.485 --> 03:44:41.707]  We certainly don't have any way to validate who did that.
[03:44:42.568 --> 03:44:48.051]  But they can say something happened and then they can finger the Russians for it and then they can start a military response.
[03:44:48.152 --> 03:44:49.552]  And now we have Obama
[03:44:50.433 --> 03:44:51.233]  Doubling down on that.
[03:44:51.293 --> 03:44:54.574]  He says he's going to consider proportional responses to Russian hacking.
[03:44:55.495 --> 03:44:56.195]  Threatening them.
[03:44:56.275 --> 03:44:57.575]  Again, they're escalating this.
[03:44:57.915 --> 03:44:58.216]  Okay?
[03:44:58.256 --> 03:45:00.956]  Saying, oh, you keep releasing information about us.
[03:45:00.997 --> 03:45:04.958]  And again, I don't believe that this information is coming from Russia.
[03:45:05.939 --> 03:45:09.760]  Neither did Bill Binney, former technical director of the NSA.
[03:45:10.360 --> 03:45:20.064]  He believes that it's people inside the intelligence community, inside the military, who are doing this because they're concerned about what Hillary Clinton and Obama are doing.
[03:45:20.764 --> 03:45:23.525]  They know what's being discussed behind closed doors.
[03:45:24.810 --> 03:45:27.092]  They know how they're trying to take this country down.
[03:45:27.512 --> 03:45:30.155]  They know how they've betrayed intelligence officers.
[03:45:30.675 --> 03:45:35.880]  Probably cost them their lives with her careless actions, as Comey called it.
[03:45:36.541 --> 03:45:42.046]  Actually, there are multiple felonies, violation of national security, so they're very concerned about what's going to happen with this.
[03:45:42.642 --> 03:45:48.987]  And so they want the American public to know, and I think whoever is doing this is a hero, just like Ed Snowden was a hero.
[03:45:49.047 --> 03:46:00.117]  They always attack and try to kill the messenger, try to distract you from seeing the information, and label these people, but now what they're doing is they're constantly blaming the Rooskies.
[03:46:01.007 --> 03:46:01.767]  Blaming the Russkies.
[03:46:01.827 --> 03:46:03.488]  Going toe-to-toe with the Russkies.
[03:46:03.528 --> 03:46:05.830]  And about to do nuclear combat.
[03:46:05.870 --> 03:46:06.830]  Toe-to-toe with the Russkies.
[03:46:06.850 --> 03:46:10.892]  Obama will consider a proportional response to recent hacks conducted by Russia.
[03:46:11.473 --> 03:46:13.894]  They say, we will obviously ensure that a U.S.
[03:46:13.934 --> 03:46:17.796]  response is proportional, but it's unlikely that our response will be announced in advance.
[03:46:18.516 --> 03:46:22.879]  It's certainly possible the President could choose response options that we never announce.
[03:46:24.096 --> 03:46:28.760]  So, we could have a cyber hack that we can't even verify was a cyber hack.
[03:46:29.420 --> 03:46:32.923]  They can then blame it on Russia, and we have no way of verifying that.
[03:46:33.784 --> 03:46:37.247]  And they can do it after they've already attacked Russia or done something.
[03:46:38.167 --> 03:46:41.050]  So they say, we're not going to announce in advance what we're going to do.
[03:46:41.250 --> 03:46:42.211]  We're just going to do something.
[03:46:43.140 --> 03:46:52.225]  And they're threatening Russia with this, whether Russia is behind this or not, they're going to blame Russia and they're going to try to use this as an excuse to escalate war.
[03:46:52.305 --> 03:46:53.545]  Russia is very concerned about this.
[03:46:53.885 --> 03:46:58.728]  They just had a civil defense bill, or drill, that was 40 million people.
[03:46:59.308 --> 03:47:02.970]  Hundreds of thousands of government officers were moving people around.
[03:47:02.990 --> 03:47:09.053]  Of course, we don't ever have anything like that here in America because, first of all, Americans don't think that nuclear war could ever touch us.
[03:47:09.373 --> 03:47:10.594]  We've never been touched by war.
[03:47:11.614 --> 03:47:12.454]  Here in America.
[03:47:13.014 --> 03:47:14.435]  And so they don't think that it could happen.
[03:47:15.115 --> 03:47:16.115]  It's very foolish, isn't it?
[03:47:16.895 --> 03:47:22.897]  But of course, even during the height of the Cold War, there was never any civil defense program created by our government.
[03:47:22.917 --> 03:47:25.838]  It was the Russians that did that to try to protect their people.
[03:47:26.198 --> 03:47:30.819]  Here in America, the only people that we really worry about protecting are those at the very top.
[03:47:30.859 --> 03:47:33.540]  They get underground bunkers to protect them.
[03:47:33.620 --> 03:47:35.360]  But if you want it, you're on your own.
[03:47:35.721 --> 03:47:36.721]  You can go out and
[03:47:37.621 --> 03:47:44.984]  And buy a bunker like people were doing back in the 1950s and 60s, and when you do it, they're going to laugh at you for doing that and trying to take care of yourself.
[03:47:45.544 --> 03:47:46.084]  That's funny.
[03:47:46.584 --> 03:47:59.229]  Anyway, they say the posting of thousands of emails from political officials on sites like DCLeaks.com and Wikileaks, as they say from the Homeland Security, these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S.
[03:47:59.289 --> 03:48:00.169]  election process.
[03:48:00.789 --> 03:48:01.149]  Oh yeah.
[03:48:01.610 --> 03:48:01.870]  Okay.
[03:48:02.671 --> 03:48:04.452]  Who's interfering with the election process?
[03:48:04.992 --> 03:48:08.355]  Well, they say it's Russia, and so they're talking about how they're going to attack Russia.
[03:48:08.375 --> 03:48:09.516]  They're taking it very seriously.
[03:48:09.856 --> 03:48:18.342]  Washington Examiner says former Soviet leader Gorbachev says U.S.-Russia tension has reached a dangerous point.
[03:48:19.143 --> 03:48:23.686]  He said that ending talks between the two world powers was the biggest mistake.
[03:48:25.127 --> 03:48:26.849]  See, think about the fact
[03:48:27.918 --> 03:48:37.386]  That throughout the GOP primaries, when we had debates, everybody was beating on Donald Trump for saying that he would talk to the Russians.
[03:48:38.487 --> 03:48:38.988]  Remember that?
[03:48:39.408 --> 03:48:40.409]  Remember Carly Fiorina?
[03:48:40.889 --> 03:48:41.710]  I wouldn't talk to them.
[03:48:42.371 --> 03:48:44.032]  I'd just show them how strong I am.
[03:48:44.112 --> 03:48:45.514]  I'd do something to them first.
[03:48:46.114 --> 03:48:47.135]  And that's what Obama is saying.
[03:48:47.175 --> 03:48:48.376]  That's what Hillary Clinton is saying.
[03:48:48.416 --> 03:48:50.178]  That's what the mainstream media is saying.
[03:48:50.878 --> 03:48:52.279]  Don't talk to these Ruskies.
[03:48:53.000 --> 03:48:54.702]  Just drop a bomb on them or something.
[03:48:55.356 --> 03:49:01.720]  You know, declare a no-fly zone in Syria, says General Petraeus and other generals, and it isn't going to cost us anything.
[03:49:01.780 --> 03:49:05.623]  We can take down all their planes and shoot down the Russian planes with cruise missiles.
[03:49:07.104 --> 03:49:08.665]  That is insane.
[03:49:09.365 --> 03:49:10.066]  That is insane.
[03:49:10.939 --> 03:49:13.480]  That is truly mutual assured destruction.
[03:49:13.500 --> 03:49:15.000]  The revival of the Cold War.
[03:49:15.541 --> 03:49:18.422]  But even pushing it further, I think, in terms of language.
[03:49:19.062 --> 03:49:33.047]  And, of course, this is in response to Secretary of State John Kerry threatening to stop all talks, all cooperation with Russia in the region, unless Russia ends its bombing of Aleppo in support of Syrian President Assad.
[03:49:33.147 --> 03:49:33.387]  Okay?
[03:49:33.907 --> 03:49:39.829]  Understand that they're not... When they support Assad, who are they fighting?
[03:49:41.052 --> 03:49:43.193]  Well, that would be ISIS, wouldn't it?
[03:49:43.914 --> 03:49:51.938]  So, Secretary of State John Kerry says, if you don't stop fighting ISIS, we're going to stop talking to you.
[03:49:52.258 --> 03:49:55.000]  We are going to take action against you.
[03:49:55.840 --> 03:49:56.721]  That's the reality.
[03:49:57.001 --> 03:50:01.423]  Meanwhile, Russia is escalating things, creating their own no-fly zone in Syria.
[03:50:01.443 --> 03:50:07.127]  Remember, Russia was invited in by the Syrian government that Obama and Hillary
[03:50:08.308 --> 03:50:13.790]  We're determined to overthrow just as they overthrew Gaddafi in Libya and created what there?
[03:50:13.950 --> 03:50:14.710]  What do we have there?
[03:50:14.770 --> 03:50:17.571]  What do we have in Iraq where we did the same thing?
[03:50:17.611 --> 03:50:19.072]  Do we have peace, stability?
[03:50:19.192 --> 03:50:20.032]  Are things better off?
[03:50:20.052 --> 03:50:31.116]  We've been to war twice in Iraq and now we have continual fighting in that area as well as Libya being turned into an arms bazaar for ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[03:50:32.602 --> 03:50:35.004]  Well, the Russians were invited in by the Syrian government.
[03:50:35.084 --> 03:50:38.767]  They have now said on their own that they're going to have a no-fly zone.
[03:50:38.947 --> 03:50:41.389]  Because they've been invited in there by the government.
[03:50:41.529 --> 03:50:44.011]  We are there in support of the rebels.
[03:50:44.111 --> 03:50:50.056]  And now Russian senators are backing a permanent deployment of the Russian Air Force to Syria.
[03:50:50.656 --> 03:50:51.697]  This is out of RT.
[03:50:51.737 --> 03:51:00.544]  They say Russian senators have ratified an agreement that allows permanent deployment of the country's air force in Syria, solidifying Moscow's projection of power in the Middle East.
[03:51:01.686 --> 03:51:04.772]  If their policy isn't suicidal, it is short-sighted, isn't it?
[03:51:04.792 --> 03:51:05.534]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:05.554 --> 03:51:05.894]  Stay with us.
[03:51:13.373 --> 03:51:18.315]  Now another shirt that was designed and licensed from Roger Stone is the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[03:51:18.995 --> 03:51:21.656]  Looks like the, you know, communist style Obama hope shirt.
[03:51:22.376 --> 03:51:28.398]  But says rape, wear it, get aggressive, start the conversations, get on TV with it.
[03:51:28.418 --> 03:51:29.418]  In fact, I'm going to say this right now.
[03:51:29.839 --> 03:51:39.042]  Anyone that gets on national TV with the shirt clearly for more than five seconds gets $1,000.
[03:51:41.636 --> 03:51:43.217]  That means, you know, behind cameras, you name it.
[03:51:43.377 --> 03:51:53.280]  Anyone that gets it on air on national TV and gets the words out, Bill Clinton is a rapist, are things along that line with a bullhorn.
[03:51:53.320 --> 03:51:54.320]  I could go to this right now. $5,000.
[03:51:58.303 --> 03:52:00.725]  Until a budget of $100,000 has been spent.
[03:52:01.125 --> 03:52:02.567]  Adoptable dogs.
[03:52:02.687 --> 03:52:09.212]  Every year, the Best Friends Animal Society helps cats and dogs who are stuck in animal shelters find homes.
[03:52:13.996 --> 03:52:19.721]  But I think one of the kind of the things that we really need to be looking at in this debate is that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:52:19.861 --> 03:52:20.802]  Infowars.com.
[03:52:20.922 --> 03:52:21.922]  Infowars.com.
[03:52:22.003 --> 03:52:22.883]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[03:52:23.224 --> 03:52:24.264]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:52:24.485 --> 03:52:24.705]  Alright.
[03:52:24.725 --> 03:52:25.645]  Bill Clinton.
[03:52:25.665 --> 03:52:32.411]  I got this Hillary for prison t-shirt and I just want everyone to know about this like big presidential campaign that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:52:32.491 --> 03:52:32.951]  Infowars.com.
[03:52:34.188 --> 03:52:34.528]  Okay.
[03:52:34.708 --> 03:52:37.869]  Thank you very much, Terrence.
[03:52:38.109 --> 03:52:39.169]  He doesn't age.
[03:52:39.509 --> 03:52:40.770]  No, he doesn't.
[03:52:40.810 --> 03:52:42.250]  He looks great.
[03:52:42.530 --> 03:52:44.811]  We're all gonna rickroll.
[03:52:45.331 --> 03:52:46.291]  Exactly.
[03:52:46.751 --> 03:52:51.312]  You've had a $100,000 contest before.
[03:52:51.332 --> 03:52:51.692]  My budget's $100,000.
[03:52:51.732 --> 03:52:56.513]  That means if a bunch of people do this, I'll pay up to $100,000 and stop it.
[03:53:05.405 --> 03:53:09.852]  That's $1,000 if you just get the shirt on national TV.
[03:53:11.594 --> 03:53:12.676]  Visually rape.
[03:53:15.270 --> 03:53:17.311]  It is.
[03:53:18.231 --> 03:53:19.192]  It is.
[03:53:19.212 --> 03:53:20.372]  $5,000 if you get the audio.
[03:53:20.392 --> 03:53:21.073]  Legally and lawfully.
[03:53:21.093 --> 03:53:21.933]  They gotta be outdoors.
[03:53:22.313 --> 03:53:22.914]  Mother-in-law events.
[03:53:22.934 --> 03:53:23.814]  You gotta have a bullhorn.
[03:53:24.354 --> 03:53:25.955]  You gotta have the shirt on or have somebody with it.
[03:53:26.295 --> 03:53:30.417]  Or maybe a big sign with it on it and two of you hold it up and then somebody else bullhorns.
[03:53:30.817 --> 03:53:33.999]  Bill Clinton is a rapist, not a philanderer.
[03:53:34.559 --> 03:53:36.020]  Hillary covers up the rape.
[03:53:40.922 --> 03:53:43.584]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see I told you so.
[03:53:43.824 --> 03:53:46.887]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[03:53:47.227 --> 03:53:47.968]  Because it's already here.
[03:53:48.348 --> 03:53:49.009]  It's being announced.
[03:53:49.369 --> 03:53:52.832]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.

[03:55:18.846 --> 03:55:19.987]  Very expensive to produce.
[03:55:21.369 --> 03:55:23.170]  $30,000 per batch just for that one ingredient.
[03:55:23.210 --> 03:55:26.714]  And of course there's other very helpful ingredients in that as well.
[03:55:27.254 --> 03:55:30.697]  Again, 23% off is a big discount, a big savings.

[03:55:34.571 --> 03:55:38.274]  Now, in the time that we have left, I want to take a look at an AP story here.
[03:55:38.334 --> 03:55:41.236]  Why do evangelicals prefer Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton?
[03:55:41.276 --> 03:55:57.389]  As they point out, in light of this tape that was released to draw people's attention away from the emails on Hillary Clinton, they say cracks have appeared in evangelical support for Trump, but backing from some of the most high-profile conservative Christian endorsers is holding.
[03:55:57.730 --> 03:56:00.412]  And I want to take a look at three different approaches to this.
[03:56:00.472 --> 03:56:03.815]  First of all, there's well-known theologian Wayne Grudem,
[03:56:04.901 --> 03:56:08.304]  Who came out and said, I'm unendorsing Donald Trump at this point.
[03:56:08.324 --> 03:56:16.973]  He had endorsed him before, said you have to understand that we can make some real, have a real effect by electing Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton.
[03:56:16.993 --> 03:56:17.794]  He had said that before.
[03:56:17.854 --> 03:56:22.738]  But now when he saw these responses, he comes out and has what I believe is a knee-jerk reaction.
[03:56:23.119 --> 03:56:26.882]  Wayne Grudem says he's the very embodiment of what the Bible calls a fool.
[03:56:27.643 --> 03:56:32.226]  I don't agree with that and neither does James Dobson of Family Talk Radio.
[03:56:33.046 --> 03:56:41.571]  He said that he doesn't like Trump's comments but he said you have to understand that Hillary Clinton's support for abortion rights is criminal.
[03:56:42.312 --> 03:56:46.935]  He said Mr. Trump promises to support religious liberty and the dignity of the unborn.
[03:56:47.475 --> 03:56:49.616]  Mrs. Clinton promises that she will not.
[03:56:50.256 --> 03:56:55.540]  You have to understand she is against your religious liberty and she is against life.
[03:56:56.721 --> 03:57:00.446]  She's not pro-life, and you have to understand there is a real choice here.
[03:57:00.786 --> 03:57:04.391]  Setting out this election is not a moral choice.
[03:57:04.451 --> 03:57:05.592]  Sorry, Glenn Beck, it isn't.
[03:57:06.193 --> 03:57:12.861]  You can sit there and pontificate, you know, in your sweater, and tell people that the moral choice is not to vote for either one of them.
[03:57:12.901 --> 03:57:13.842]  No, you're going to get one of them.
[03:57:14.639 --> 03:57:16.761]  And you can make a legitimate difference here.
[03:57:17.402 --> 03:57:30.415]  You can either have a situation where you have to fight Hillary Clinton on every single issue, not only Hillary Clinton, but the Republican establishment and the Democrat establishment and the media establishment on every single issue.
[03:57:30.996 --> 03:57:33.678]  And you're going to lose your country to a globalist government.
[03:57:33.778 --> 03:57:35.659]  But you're going to lose, first of all, your religious liberty.
[03:57:35.699 --> 03:57:36.760]  So think about that, Christians.
[03:57:37.240 --> 03:57:38.901]  And then, of course, Jerry Falwell Jr.
[03:57:38.941 --> 03:57:40.022]  We've talked about this before.
[03:57:40.442 --> 03:57:42.663]  He's the one, I think, that understands it the most.
[03:57:43.304 --> 03:57:47.407]  He understands that, OK, these comments he said were reprehensible.
[03:57:47.427 --> 03:57:52.370]  But he also understands that not only do we have a clear choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump,
[03:57:52.990 --> 03:58:01.477]  He said, we're never going to have a perfect candidate, but he also suggested that the video leak was engineered by Trump's enemies in his own party.
[03:58:01.877 --> 03:58:04.620]  You understand, this is the Bushes doing it for the Clintons.
[03:58:04.920 --> 03:58:06.281]  He said, I think it was timed.
[03:58:06.561 --> 03:58:15.269]  I think it might have been a conspiracy, you know, among the establishment Republicans who've known about it for weeks, who tried to time it so that it could do the maximum damage.
[03:58:15.949 --> 03:58:18.011]  That's precisely what is going on.
[03:58:18.371 --> 03:58:24.076]  He understands the technique that they're using here, and he understands what is truly at stake.
[03:58:24.356 --> 03:58:31.882]  There is a real, clear, distinguishing difference between the two of them, and it's going to make a very big difference which one of them is president.
[03:58:32.683 --> 03:58:35.645]  Join us tonight for the InfoWars Nightly News at 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:35.685 --> 03:58:35.965]  Eastern.
[03:58:35.985 --> 03:58:36.526]  I'll be hosting.
[03:58:50.365 --> 03:58:52.230]  You are listening to GCN.

[03:59:00.140 --> 03:59:05.063]  There's an unprecedented crackdown underway against Christians worshipping in secret in Iran.
[03:59:05.263 --> 03:59:10.387]  Iranian police enter family parties and weddings in an effort to find those who turned their backs on Islam.
[03:59:10.667 --> 03:59:22.295]  Iranian Christian news source Mojave News reports that a house raid on September 30th resulted in the arrest of five men who were taken to an unknown location and charged with evangelism, a crime that could mean death in Iran.
[03:59:22.335 --> 03:59:29.960]  In a 2016 report, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom said that Christians and other minorities in Iran continue to experience severe
[03:59:30.080 --> 03:59:31.040]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting.
