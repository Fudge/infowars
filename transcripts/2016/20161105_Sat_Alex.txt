[00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:16.075]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:19.876]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:01:33.032 --> 00:01:33.864]  That's how unreal it should be.
[00:01:55.797 --> 00:02:11.380]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[00:02:12.681 --> 00:02:14.261]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:17.622]  You want it, baby?
[00:02:17.642 --> 00:02:18.362]  You're about
[00:03:35.197 --> 00:03:37.640]  People should not be afraid of their governments.
[00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:07.927]  I hear them inside!
[00:04:08.028 --> 00:04:10.236]  Several party members have been murdered, Chief Inspector.
[00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:21.517]  We're interrupting your regularly scheduled program to bring you this terrifying report.
[00:04:21.577 --> 00:04:24.037]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:04:24.617 --> 00:04:26.178]  It just pancaked.
[00:04:26.618 --> 00:04:30.399]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.379]  New York, very much a city still in chaos.
[00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.700]  The phones are not working properly, the subway lines are not working properly.
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.521]  The sky now black with smoke in front of us, just across the Tigris River here.
[00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:47.083]  This is shock and awe, Tom, to the population of Baghdad.
[00:04:48.023 --> 00:04:49.764]  Shock and awe, indeed.
[00:04:50.244 --> 00:04:55.746]  The people you liberate will witness the honorable and decent spirit of the American military.
[00:04:56.226 --> 00:04:59.187]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:04:59.527 --> 00:05:02.088]  Come on!
[00:05:02.388 --> 00:05:03.789]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:05.430]  A new world order.
[00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:06.410]  I love my dad.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.901]  I'd kill for him.
[00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:10.863]  I'd go to prison for him because I love him so much.
[00:05:11.003 --> 00:05:11.824]  I love Bill Clinton.
[00:05:12.104 --> 00:05:14.466]  What does that make Hillary Clinton to the Bush family?
[00:05:15.227 --> 00:05:16.047]  My sister-in-law.
[00:05:16.127 --> 00:05:21.992]  When you are subverting the power of government, that's a fundamentally dangerous thing to democracy.
[00:05:22.012 --> 00:05:23.374]  What do you think of Edward Snowden?
[00:05:24.314 --> 00:05:25.095]  I think he's a traitor.
[00:05:25.355 --> 00:05:27.176]  Obama is the one that kills the U.S.
[00:05:27.216 --> 00:05:28.837]  troops if the Russians bomb any of them.
[00:05:29.017 --> 00:05:30.878]  Obama is the one that put them in harm's way.
[00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:33.259]  Obama is the one using them as human shields.
[00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:37.682]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate, criminal government in American history.
[00:05:37.782 --> 00:05:38.762]  I'm here to warn people!
[00:05:38.782 --> 00:05:40.063]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[00:05:40.363 --> 00:05:41.243]  This isn't a game!
[00:05:45.811 --> 00:05:47.092]  Welcome to America, ISIS!
[00:05:47.112 --> 00:05:48.293]  This is what we do!
[00:05:48.513 --> 00:05:48.993]  Woo!
[00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:52.896]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[00:05:53.036 --> 00:05:54.717]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[00:05:54.757 --> 00:05:56.058]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[00:05:56.278 --> 00:06:05.864]  In 2012, your agency was saying, quote, the Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Al-Qaeda in Iraq are the major forces driving the insurgents in Syria.
[00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:06.945]  In 2012, the U.S.
[00:06:06.965 --> 00:06:10.207]  was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups.
[00:06:10.227 --> 00:06:11.228]  Why did you not stop that?
[00:06:11.308 --> 00:06:12.469]  Why didn't you come forward before?
[00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:13.850]  What were you waiting for?
[00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.471]  Well, for you, Inspector.
[00:06:16.471 --> 00:06:17.212]  I needed you.
[00:06:23.896 --> 00:06:27.157]  I suddenly had this feeling that everything was connected.
[00:06:27.298 --> 00:06:33.681]  We're all part of it.
[00:06:33.701 --> 00:06:34.722]  Are we ready for it?
[00:06:36.923 --> 00:06:41.906]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:46.468 --> 00:06:49.831]  Hands down, this is the most important broadcast of my life.
[00:06:51.212 --> 00:06:52.393]  It is the 5th of November, 2016.
[00:06:55.716 --> 00:07:06.665]  Now, as things progress, and as there's a quickening globally of good and evil, as well as technology and knowledge, that will be a more and more frequent occurrence.
[00:07:06.685 --> 00:07:10.048]  But this is, hands down, the most important broadcast of my life.
[00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:14.592]  And probably one of the most important transmissions you've ever seen.
[00:07:15.882 --> 00:07:16.963]  I'm up here on Saturday night.
[00:07:18.804 --> 00:07:21.547]  I'm not on my big list of over 200 AM and FM stations.
[00:07:21.567 --> 00:07:22.487]  We're not on UHF.
[00:07:22.748 --> 00:07:24.209]  We're not on cable like we normally are.
[00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.091]  I'll be on tomorrow, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:07:27.131 --> 00:07:28.692]  as I've done a Sunday show for 10 years.
[00:07:30.274 --> 00:07:30.914]  Weekday show for 20.
[00:07:32.275 --> 00:07:32.576]  Plus.
[00:07:34.477 --> 00:07:35.638]  But this is the most important.
[00:07:35.878 --> 00:07:39.161]  And I went to bed last night and then woke up at 2 a.m.
[00:07:39.181 --> 00:07:39.922]  and haven't been to sleep.
[00:07:40.902 --> 00:07:42.784]  My crew has got the same spirit.
[00:07:45.683 --> 00:07:48.664]  And it's because we're immersed in what's happening with WikiLeaks.
[00:07:50.464 --> 00:07:55.605]  We're immersed in this election, and we have looked at the facts.
[00:07:57.286 --> 00:07:58.546]  Incredible things are happening.
[00:07:59.486 --> 00:08:00.787]  Now, here's what we know.
[00:08:00.807 --> 00:08:14.410]  There are now almost 40 data dumps into just one man, her Chief of Staff's operation.
[00:08:15.947 --> 00:08:16.647]  Mr. Podesta.
[00:08:19.128 --> 00:08:30.513]  And in the latest one to come out, it's talking about what's on the menu at a private, satanic, Aleister Crowley ritual, blood ritual.
[00:08:32.273 --> 00:08:34.354]  Just the public stuff this high priestess puts out.
[00:08:34.574 --> 00:08:35.855]  And she admits she's a high priestess.
[00:08:37.135 --> 00:08:38.095]  She admits it's religious.
[00:08:39.296 --> 00:08:41.277]  It's so satanic, I can't even watch it.
[00:08:42.537 --> 00:08:44.478]  As a simulated sacrifice of children.
[00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:46.855]  And people drinking real blood.
[00:08:49.317 --> 00:08:50.557]  Semen, urine, you name it.
[00:08:51.758 --> 00:09:02.926]  Now, that said, my friends, that broke, that was the top internet search, and ours was the top, just so you know, if you're a new viewer, this is news making.
[00:09:04.568 --> 00:09:12.013]  On Friday, into today, the number one search term on the internet, here it is from DrugsReport.com, Podesta practices occult magic.
[00:09:15.453 --> 00:09:23.719]  Under it, FBI agency antichrist, Assange, Clinton ISIS funded by same money, terror threat warning, Monday.
[00:09:23.739 --> 00:09:26.501]  This all ties together.
[00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:28.762]  We're going to be breaking it down today.
[00:09:28.843 --> 00:09:44.794]  Now, that said, up until five minutes before I went on air, and I can show TV viewers a document cam shot of all these dozens and dozens and dozens of news stories and documents, my head was spinning as I went through the new emails that came out today.
[00:09:48.308 --> 00:09:57.537]  And I was going through the different hacker sites that are analyzing it and reading the certifications from WikiLeaks and folks, we found even worse stuff than we're about to cover right now.
[00:09:57.877 --> 00:10:05.524]  So my head is spinning right now off of what I just discovered in the last hour that I'm not going to get to here tonight.
[00:10:06.445 --> 00:10:13.011]  I'll probably, after the show, after this two-hour transmission, shoot another Facebook message just to get it out or I won't be able to sleep.
[00:10:18.047 --> 00:10:28.092]  I have spent, since 2.30am, more than 15 hours of that time reading these and looking at them.
[00:10:29.253 --> 00:10:31.354]  Now, what am I about to get to?
[00:10:33.175 --> 00:10:37.957]  Yes, the Aleister Crowley black magic, the spirit cooking, was big.
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:55.030]  We had on a law enforcement source from New York two days before saying, no, I'm being told there's code words in the emails for the trafficking of children, and the FBI is on record saying Liener, who's involved in all this, is contacting 15-year-olds, and that they, quote, reopened it as a sex investigation.
[00:10:55.670 --> 00:11:09.179]  Now the FBI comes out today and admits they believe Hillary Clinton traveled to the orgy island of Jeffrey Epstein, who admittedly was trafficking in small children on his wide-body jet around the world.
[00:11:10.188 --> 00:11:13.069]  And Bill Clinton traveled on it 20 plus times, Hillary six times.
[00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:24.674]  Perhaps I should just, for radio and TV viewers, perhaps I should just go over some headlines before I plunge into all this, and then it ties into election disruption.
[00:11:25.454 --> 00:11:28.255]  It ties into the fact that we're two and a half, three days out.
[00:11:28.295 --> 00:11:35.038]  I mean, three days until election day is half over, but we're just two and a half days out from the day starting.
[00:11:35.098 --> 00:11:37.459]  I mean, this is an epic time to be alive.
[00:11:39.315 --> 00:11:42.316]  And by the way, the background research is now happening on the internet.
[00:11:42.757 --> 00:11:48.539]  As we learn about the rituals, we pull up a Washington Post article with Podesta's brother.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.842]  And blood ritual photos and naked kids in the Washington Post.
[00:11:57.524 --> 00:12:01.686]  The Washington Post pulled this on Friday.
[00:12:02.246 --> 00:12:06.128]  Folks noticed it and went to the Wayback Machine and found it.
[00:12:07.568 --> 00:12:10.089]  What I'm saying is this is one piece of literally hundreds, folks.
[00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:16.770]  They are actively... See, I have Salon right here and others, and the UN, saying pedophilia is a good thing.
[00:12:18.131 --> 00:12:23.992]  So one thing they do is they push it on their own agenda, and then when they get exposed, though, they pull back.
[00:12:24.012 --> 00:12:24.472]  You understand?
[00:12:25.773 --> 00:12:29.513]  So married with art, Tony and Heather Podesta are a study in power collecting.
[00:12:30.234 --> 00:12:31.474]  And then it gets into what they do.
[00:12:33.646 --> 00:12:35.367]  There is just one exhibit, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:36.028 --> 00:12:36.889]  They don't want you to read.
[00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:42.953]  Now, before I go any further, before I get into the meat and potatoes of this, let me just explain what's happened and why this is so big.
[00:12:43.634 --> 00:12:48.758]  Everyone's been focusing in on this email or that email and putting stories out about each email.
[00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:49.579]  No.
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:13:00.247]  We had, eight, nine days ago, the FBI reopened the investigation because of what they said they found on a laptop that had not been given over to the FBI.
[00:13:00.287 --> 00:13:02.089]  This was in an NYPD investigation.
[00:13:04.377 --> 00:13:05.879]  We didn't learn that for about four or five days.
[00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:09.024]  I learned about it actually first when I was told about it by Doug Eggman.
[00:13:09.404 --> 00:13:14.491]  A day later it was in the news that the NYPD was going to have a press conference two weeks ago.
[00:13:16.428 --> 00:13:29.881]  Bringing out the fact that in a separate case with a girl who complained, who was 15, sexted by Wiener, they'd gotten in his laptop and it was full of child trafficking, money laundering, blackmail, you name it.
[00:13:30.081 --> 00:13:30.541]  Anthony Wiener.
[00:13:30.561 --> 00:13:31.763]  I mean, look at Aberdeen, look at Wiener.
[00:13:32.043 --> 00:13:35.406]  My God, her mother's the top genital mutilation of little girls in the world.
[00:13:35.446 --> 00:13:37.468]  The main pusher of cutting girls' genitals off.
[00:13:37.488 --> 00:13:38.369]  Talk about sex abuse.
[00:13:39.773 --> 00:13:41.694]  These people are demons obsessed with children.
[00:13:41.734 --> 00:13:45.536]  We already know that in their public life, so that's why the FBI was forced to do this.
[00:13:46.016 --> 00:13:48.057]  Now the rank-and-file FBI wants to expose as well.
[00:13:48.358 --> 00:13:52.300]  That's all come out in the London Guardian, New York Times, that they're in total revolt, saying Hillary is pure evil.
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:53.320]  A devil.
[00:13:54.121 --> 00:13:58.303]  Notice I told you months ago, I was told that by federal sources, that we literally think she's a devil.
[00:13:58.363 --> 00:13:58.923]  I go, what do you mean?
[00:13:58.943 --> 00:13:59.964]  And they said, Linda Blair.
[00:13:59.984 --> 00:14:01.324]  I said, what do you mean?
[00:14:01.685 --> 00:14:02.205]  Linda Blair.
[00:14:03.464 --> 00:14:05.225]  I've talked to Blackwater people, you name it.
[00:14:05.565 --> 00:14:08.085]  She is literally like Linda Blair, okay?
[00:14:08.886 --> 00:14:14.987]  The president attacked me, Hillary attacked me, they attacked me in some cases by name because it really got to them.
[00:14:15.708 --> 00:14:20.129]  Because they know, the Secret Service and the FBI people know what they're doing.
[00:14:20.669 --> 00:14:24.310]  Now whether it's a psychological mental illness or whether demons are real, I don't know.
[00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.891]  The point is, is that this is what happened.
[00:14:28.872 --> 00:14:31.252]  So, it all comes back up.
[00:14:31.572 --> 00:14:33.093]  Notice WikiLeaks lines up with it.
[00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.692]  Imagine what's in the 650,000 emails they've got.
[00:14:36.712 --> 00:14:38.353]  A lot of the same ones we know.
[00:14:41.356 --> 00:14:46.400]  So then, I talked to our sources, some of them public, some of them private, Doug Hackman and others.
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.222]  Hackman admittedly trains the NYPD, you name it.
[00:14:49.762 --> 00:14:51.464]  I have secret service connections to the NYPD.
[00:14:51.504 --> 00:14:52.805]  They concur with what he tells me.
[00:14:53.245 --> 00:14:54.226]  They were going to have a press conference.
[00:14:54.566 --> 00:14:58.809]  That's now come out in mainstream news three days after we covered it.
[00:14:58.829 --> 00:14:59.490]  Do you understand?
[00:15:01.152 --> 00:15:07.235]  That the NYPD is saying, yes, pedophilia, the pedophile island, Jeffrey Epstein, all of it.
[00:15:09.216 --> 00:15:12.358]  And they always knew this was going to come out in the last six months.
[00:15:13.198 --> 00:15:18.181]  So that's why, because this NYPD thing started almost a year ago.
[00:15:19.061 --> 00:15:22.383]  That's why they tried to claim Trump was with Epstein and all this stuff.
[00:15:23.924 --> 00:15:29.987]  With no proof and then dropped the lawsuits was to know, oh God, if it comes out, we got to have him blamed too, because we know that's what we've done.
[00:15:31.775 --> 00:15:39.461]  So the big issue here is they've had Mother Jones and New York Daily News and a few others make fun of us and say, oh, you're crazy.
[00:15:39.761 --> 00:15:41.362]  You just don't get performance art.
[00:15:41.662 --> 00:15:43.083]  The woman admits she does real rituals.
[00:15:43.704 --> 00:15:44.825]  She admits she's a high priestess.
[00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:47.387]  When it's in public, she says, well, the intent's different.
[00:15:47.607 --> 00:15:48.828]  Yeah, it's to suck folks into the cult.
[00:15:49.148 --> 00:15:51.049]  When it's in private, she says, yeah, we're doing rituals.
[00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:52.530]  I know the rituals.
[00:15:52.571 --> 00:15:53.111]  They're voodoo.
[00:15:53.371 --> 00:15:54.672]  The minute I saw it, it's voodoo.
[00:15:56.854 --> 00:15:57.534]  And now, guess what?
[00:15:57.574 --> 00:15:58.255]  They admit it's voodoo.
[00:16:00.111 --> 00:16:09.957]  Bill Clinton wrote in his own book, I'm gonna show you this, actual shots of it, that his early life, that he is a practitioner of voodoo and enjoys being inhabited by spirits.
[00:16:10.658 --> 00:16:11.899]  That's not me, it's Bill Clinton.
[00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:14.440]  Do you understand?
[00:16:16.702 --> 00:16:21.145]  And this hidden white magic we're talking about here, folks, this is the nasty stuff, okay?
[00:16:21.605 --> 00:16:23.766]  Alistair Crowley-level stuff is the worst there is.
[00:16:24.427 --> 00:16:26.228]  You go, wait, is it voodoo or is it Alistair Crowley?
[00:16:26.268 --> 00:16:27.629]  It's all the same crap.
[00:16:28.249 --> 00:16:29.010]  It's a mix of the two.
[00:16:29.909 --> 00:16:37.313]  So let me go over some headlines for you first, but law enforcement is begging you, not that they're perfect, nobody's perfect, but they're the ones blowing the whistle.
[00:16:37.793 --> 00:16:41.755]  They're the ones that keep arresting high-level Homeland Security people locally who are involved in pedophilia.
[00:16:41.775 --> 00:16:56.543]  You see it in the news all the time because this is a guild that got control of Penn State, they got control of the Catholic Church to a great extent to take it over, they've gotten control of the Royal Family, they admit it's a national security issue in the UK, pedophilia, Satanism, kids being killed.
[00:16:56.863 --> 00:16:58.724]  This is mainstream news.
[00:17:00.526 --> 00:17:02.247]  So it's all coming out, okay?
[00:17:02.367 --> 00:17:06.968]  Now, again, I told you months ago, I said, our federal sources say they're devil worshipers.
[00:17:07.848 --> 00:17:10.589]  Our federal sources say they're really doing horrible things.
[00:17:10.629 --> 00:17:16.351]  And I didn't even say on air some of the stuff I was told, but quite frankly, they just said, it's worse than what you're saying.
[00:17:16.371 --> 00:17:18.171]  And I said, well, like what?
[00:17:18.211 --> 00:17:19.132]  And they said, devil worship.
[00:17:19.792 --> 00:17:22.072]  They said, devil worship, Alex, okay?
[00:17:23.533 --> 00:17:25.694]  And she's falling down all the time, and she's got a special van.
[00:17:25.754 --> 00:17:27.994]  And it's getting worse.
[00:17:29.015 --> 00:17:30.155]  And she goes crazy all the time.
[00:17:31.457 --> 00:17:32.958]  And, like, Linda Blair.
[00:17:33.858 --> 00:17:34.478]  And she stinks.
[00:17:35.859 --> 00:17:36.539]  And so does Obama.
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:38.360]  I go, what do you mean?
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.401]  They're like, no one wants to work around them.
[00:17:42.182 --> 00:17:43.022]  And we're going to stop right there?
[00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:46.064]  I mean, imagine Fed's telling you, no one will believe us.
[00:17:46.464 --> 00:17:50.166]  They told the Leningradian, she's literally the anti-Christ.
[00:17:50.206 --> 00:17:50.986]  That's the headline.
[00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:54.591]  These people are scared, folks.
[00:17:54.631 --> 00:18:05.861]  Whatever it is they've been saying, and they won't even tell me, they say, they say, you'll be walking down the hall at night, and it's Obama, he acts totally normal, and it'll be like, crap your pants, okay?
[00:18:06.662 --> 00:18:08.143]  I don't know what's going on, folks.
[00:18:08.564 --> 00:18:10.425]  All I know is, it's all coming out.
[00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:19.754]  They do these rituals, these kids, they're hooked to people, they've got kids disappearing from Haiti, the Clintons are vacationing in Haiti, they have their honeymoon there.
[00:18:20.034 --> 00:18:21.195]  They admit they're into voodoo.
[00:18:21.475 --> 00:18:23.636]  I got Washington Post saying they follow voodoo.
[00:18:23.896 --> 00:18:25.577]  I'm going to show it all to you.
[00:18:27.998 --> 00:18:29.879]  And again, that's a Zero Hedge article.
[00:18:29.899 --> 00:18:30.800]  People go, oh, that's Zero Hedge.
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:31.620]  Well, they're respected.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:32.641]  It's The Guardian.
[00:18:32.681 --> 00:18:33.601]  See, second line right there.
[00:18:33.621 --> 00:18:33.841]  Click.
[00:18:34.122 --> 00:18:35.162]  Second line, The Guardian.
[00:18:36.523 --> 00:18:39.344]  This is senior FBI agents say they're all against her.
[00:18:39.404 --> 00:18:40.525]  They say she's the Antichrist.
[00:18:40.545 --> 00:18:41.065]  They're scared.
[00:18:41.185 --> 00:18:42.146]  What did I tell you two months ago?
[00:18:43.567 --> 00:18:44.347]  They're all against her.
[00:18:45.007 --> 00:18:45.568]  They're scared.
[00:18:46.755 --> 00:18:47.376]  And they say, why?
[00:18:47.396 --> 00:18:49.438]  And they just go, Antichrist, Antichrist.
[00:18:49.798 --> 00:18:50.078]  Okay?
[00:18:51.179 --> 00:18:53.761]  I mean, look, you think I'd just go on air and say that if it wasn't true?
[00:18:55.343 --> 00:19:04.051]  I have talked to feds, folks, that start getting tears in their eyes because they've signed letters, they can't say what it is, that when they talk about it, they start breaking down.
[00:19:04.271 --> 00:19:04.551]  Okay?
[00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:08.755]  Grown men start breaking down.
[00:19:10.897 --> 00:19:11.518]  Do you understand?
[00:19:15.526 --> 00:19:18.988]  Now, let me get into political, the news, will they stage riots?
[00:19:19.028 --> 00:19:20.109]  That's all in the second hour.
[00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:21.310]  Okay?
[00:19:23.231 --> 00:19:25.933]  And I'm going to have Owen Schroer come in here.
[00:19:26.934 --> 00:19:27.774]  Matt does a great job.
[00:19:27.814 --> 00:19:30.356]  Anytime he wants to pop in, his analysis is incredible.
[00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:31.997]  He's got a lot of info we worked on.
[00:19:32.277 --> 00:19:35.139]  Daria, you guys are welcome to host the third hour after I go if you want.
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:40.503]  That's why, frankly, I've been up since 2-2-15 and I've got to make myself go home and go to sleep or I'll be a basket case.
[00:19:40.523 --> 00:19:43.084]  We're going to be broadcasting 52 hours live starting Monday.
[00:19:44.164 --> 00:19:45.526]  Right through Tuesday, right through Wednesday.
[00:19:45.546 --> 00:19:48.650]  I'll be here for 18 hours of it.
[00:19:49.711 --> 00:19:50.172]  Live on air.
[00:19:51.789 --> 00:19:53.889]  I'll be battling in other ways as well.
[00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:55.990]  But I just got a haircut.
[00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:56.770]  They cut a little too short.
[00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.771]  I don't have a whole cruise to get my hair done.
[00:19:58.791 --> 00:20:03.432]  I kind of was reading articles to write until I came in and I'm kind of trying to get my hair done right now so it looks all right for folks.
[00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:04.812]  Because this is seat of your pants.
[00:20:04.832 --> 00:20:06.952]  I mean, we're not up here on Saturday night because we want to be.
[00:20:07.653 --> 00:20:13.654]  I need to stop the stress, but I mean, I cannot just go, oh my God, that stuff scares me too much.
[00:20:13.714 --> 00:20:15.354]  So I can't be involved.
[00:20:15.474 --> 00:20:17.695]  I've got to do something or die trying.
[00:20:19.104 --> 00:20:21.185]  And by the way, have I ever had any fears of Hillary the Globalist?
[00:20:21.705 --> 00:20:23.746]  The more evil I learn they are, the more I have zero.
[00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:26.667]  It's like I'm so committed to defend the innocent.
[00:20:26.907 --> 00:20:28.028]  And not because I'm a hero, folks.
[00:20:28.068 --> 00:20:29.328]  It's a normal human instinct.
[00:20:29.648 --> 00:20:36.031]  If you don't have an instinct to absolutely expose these people and spread the word on them, no matter what happens in this election, you're not alive.
[00:20:36.051 --> 00:20:37.872]  You don't have the spirit of God in you.
[00:20:38.032 --> 00:20:38.792]  I'll tell you that right now.
[00:20:38.812 --> 00:20:42.554]  Because my spirit is on fire to resist these people.
[00:20:45.333 --> 00:20:47.740]  Now, let me get to it because this is all coming out now.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.150]  This isn't me saying this two months ago or a month ago or last week.
[00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:51.912]  It's all here.
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:57.802]  I mean, folks, we have former CIA deputy director sources.
[00:20:57.842 --> 00:20:58.622]  We have generals.
[00:20:58.923 --> 00:21:01.324]  We have colonels, current and former lieutenant colonels.
[00:21:01.804 --> 00:21:03.005]  We have black op people.
[00:21:03.065 --> 00:21:13.431]  I told you we have folks inside Blackwater who I'd been lied to about and who I now learned, they confirmed, they would get blamed for every other bad contractor because Blackwater just became the name.
[00:21:14.032 --> 00:21:17.774]  And I'm not saying they're perfect, but most of the stuff was disinfo by the media because they were patriots.
[00:21:18.674 --> 00:21:21.776]  I keep telling you, Blackwater has given us intel that's been spot on.
[00:21:22.416 --> 00:21:29.660]  People formerly with Blackwater, and I mean commanders, now Eric Prentz has gone public, who's never seen anymore, because they're after him.
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:30.280]  Why?
[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.982]  Because folks, it is down to the wire here.
[00:21:34.929 --> 00:21:37.071]  But I told you Blackwater is fighting this.
[00:21:37.351 --> 00:21:42.815]  Blackwater's in Breitbart saying FBI sources and others, they're running child kidnapping rings, folks.
[00:21:43.596 --> 00:21:44.517]  Hillary's involved.
[00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:45.257]  Of course she is.
[00:21:45.297 --> 00:21:48.720]  Look at that big, dominant, crazy Joker face, man.
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.062]  That woman's a frickin' hellhound.
[00:21:51.902 --> 00:21:56.286]  An actual, full-bore, bipedal, conscious, walkin' demon.
[00:21:57.126 --> 00:21:57.727]  Antichrist.
[00:21:58.427 --> 00:22:00.509]  The Bible says there's many antichrists, folks, but she is.
[00:22:00.889 --> 00:22:01.730]  She's a walker.
[00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:03.852]  I mean, she's full possessed.
[00:22:04.778 --> 00:22:06.639]  When that demon lets out of there, she hits the ground.
[00:22:10.642 --> 00:22:11.403]  That's the FBI.
[00:22:11.443 --> 00:22:12.083]  They've been around her.
[00:22:13.024 --> 00:22:13.625]  Secret Service.
[00:22:13.645 --> 00:22:15.126]  They, the people have nightmares.
[00:22:15.346 --> 00:22:16.307]  They crap their pants.
[00:22:16.367 --> 00:22:17.447]  They want off the detail.
[00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.930]  I'm gonna stop right there.
[00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:23.312]  I told you this stuff months ago and now it's in the news.
[00:22:26.975 --> 00:22:30.737]  I don't know whether it's some super mental illness or whether interdimensional crap's real or whatever.
[00:22:31.058 --> 00:22:34.160]  The point is, people that have been around her start crying.
[00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:37.770]  Now let's get into the headlines here.
[00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:39.551]  Let me just show everybody who thinks this is a big joke.
[00:22:40.211 --> 00:22:53.813]  All of you out there at Mother Jones and everywhere else making jokes about this and places like Salon where you're not writing articles about how great pedophilia is and some sicko, how he desires five-year-old girls.
[00:22:53.853 --> 00:22:55.113]  I mean they got some freaky stuff.
[00:22:55.453 --> 00:22:56.974]  This is who these people are.
[00:22:58.554 --> 00:22:59.694]  And they think it's all funny.
[00:23:01.374 --> 00:23:04.375]  What's happening at the Catholic Church and what's going on with Sandusky.
[00:23:04.535 --> 00:23:05.155]  They think it's funny.
[00:23:07.705 --> 00:23:08.425]  So let's continue.
[00:23:08.445 --> 00:23:09.765]  Let's go through this for you right now.
[00:23:10.285 --> 00:23:11.206]  This is World Net Daily.
[00:23:11.286 --> 00:23:14.046]  Source, FBI has evidence Hillary visited Orgy Island.
[00:23:14.366 --> 00:23:15.026]  That's today.
[00:23:16.286 --> 00:23:17.287]  Here's the Washington Post.
[00:23:17.607 --> 00:23:20.747]  The time Bill and Hillary Clinton went to a voodoo ceremony in Haiti.
[00:23:20.827 --> 00:23:23.468]  I'm going to actually get to where he says they got married there.
[00:23:23.488 --> 00:23:24.528]  They had their honeymoon there.
[00:23:24.548 --> 00:23:25.728]  They got honeymoon there, not married.
[00:23:26.068 --> 00:23:29.109]  And how he loves to have the spirits, good and evil, enter him.
[00:23:29.169 --> 00:23:31.729]  And that's his world religion.
[00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:36.110]  By the way, voodoo is to sacrifice children.
[00:23:36.973 --> 00:23:47.699]  Eric Prince, NYPD, ready to make arrests in Anthony Weiner case, Hillary flying to the pedophile island, high-level federal and state law enforcement and city law enforcement sources, trafficking of children.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:55.043]  And I mean, you look at Weiner, you look at Aberdeen, my God, are they not central casting if you're making a Hollywood movie about folks in a white van?
[00:23:56.264 --> 00:23:57.685]  But they do it with immigrant children.
[00:23:57.705 --> 00:23:59.806]  Why do they throw all into this immigrant trade, folks?
[00:24:01.738 --> 00:24:02.919]  Good God!
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.641]  Good Lord!
[00:24:06.221 --> 00:24:10.004]  And the word is, Wiener isn't even... Wiener's like a Renfield for Dracula.
[00:24:10.024 --> 00:24:12.345]  He just kind of stumbles around all day.
[00:24:13.026 --> 00:24:15.668]  And again, a lot of people that work for these people were abused themselves.
[00:24:15.708 --> 00:24:19.210]  They're real... If somebody's been really hardcore abused, they're almost like retarded.
[00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:22.672]  They're just kind of like... And this is well known out there.
[00:24:22.692 --> 00:24:24.774]  And then they're like the servants of the abusers.
[00:24:29.688 --> 00:24:31.930]  FBI agents, Hillary is the Antichrist personified.
[00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:35.833]  Mention that, that's out of The Hill and that's out of The Guardian.
[00:24:36.954 --> 00:24:38.395]  They keep asking, they go, what do you mean Antichrist?
[00:24:38.415 --> 00:24:38.855]  You mean figure?
[00:24:38.895 --> 00:24:40.016]  They go, no, Antichrist.
[00:24:40.036 --> 00:24:40.416]  They go, what?
[00:24:40.436 --> 00:24:42.398]  They go, she's evil.
[00:24:42.918 --> 00:24:43.859]  Okay, let's continue.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.621]  Never heard the FBI talk like that before, have you?
[00:24:46.661 --> 00:24:48.663]  Because this stuff's real, folks.
[00:24:48.703 --> 00:24:49.443]  This stuff happens.
[00:24:49.844 --> 00:24:51.725]  This is the takeover of the United States, okay?
[00:24:52.606 --> 00:24:53.947]  Now, before I go any further,
[00:24:57.042 --> 00:24:58.442]  Let's just give you some more background here.
[00:24:58.482 --> 00:24:59.343]  Let's go to these articles.
[00:25:00.183 --> 00:25:03.064]  Julian Assange, and I've got clips of him doing a new interview today coming up.
[00:25:05.184 --> 00:25:08.905]  America Press supports demon Hillary Clinton.
[00:25:09.985 --> 00:25:11.546]  And Bill calls her a demon.
[00:25:12.066 --> 00:25:14.967]  He wants to quote, put our necks all in a noose if she gets in.
[00:25:14.987 --> 00:25:16.287]  Okay?
[00:25:16.707 --> 00:25:17.207]  Here's another one.
[00:25:17.227 --> 00:25:19.728]  This is the Washington Post I mentioned from 1996.
[00:25:20.768 --> 00:25:22.729]  Book says Hillary talks to the dead.
[00:25:24.269 --> 00:25:28.171]  It says that it calms her, but that she'll talk to anybody but Jesus Christ.
[00:25:28.211 --> 00:25:30.953]  Of course, because it's a demon.
[00:25:31.753 --> 00:25:33.214]  And then it goes through how she does it.
[00:25:33.735 --> 00:25:38.758]  And we have an article breaking it down, flashback, a cultic Hillary summons the dead, refuses to speak to Christ.
[00:25:39.618 --> 00:25:41.939]  Hillary was attending a satanic church, says Clinton insider.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.502]  Now here's Bill Clinton's book, page 312, 313, and 314.
[00:25:47.102 --> 00:25:48.403]  Show this to TV viewers.
[00:25:53.598 --> 00:25:56.520]  This is the book, My Life, The Early Years.
[00:25:59.163 --> 00:26:06.409]  He goes into, I was particularly intrigued by voodoo and culture to which I had some limited exposure in New Orleans and existed alongside Catholicism in Haiti.
[00:26:06.909 --> 00:26:17.078]  So they went and they got their honeymoon there and then he talks about practicing chemical engineer until his voodoo priest grandfather in his deathbed chose Max to succeed him.
[00:26:18.325 --> 00:26:25.931]  He explains that in voodoo, God is manifest to humans, whose spirits represent forces of light and darkness, good and evil, which are more or less in balance.
[00:26:26.011 --> 00:26:33.236]  After Hillary, David and I finished our brief course in voodoo, course in voodoo theology, we were escorted back to an open area and seated.
[00:26:33.256 --> 00:26:36.319]  And he goes through voodoo rituals he conducts and how he enjoyed the spirits.
[00:26:36.719 --> 00:26:38.781]  Now, I'm going to continue here for you.
[00:26:39.201 --> 00:26:41.042]  Let's get all this out in the open, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:41.062 --> 00:26:41.763]  Let's talk about it.
[00:26:45.418 --> 00:26:47.319]  Let's talk about the Secret Service and FBI.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.521]  Grown men breaking down and crying.
[00:26:49.541 --> 00:26:57.106]  And being forced, as corrupt as they've been and the problems that have been there in the government, to finally tell the truth.
[00:26:57.506 --> 00:26:58.247]  Spirit cooking!
[00:26:58.307 --> 00:27:05.332]  Clinton campaign chairman invited to bizarre satanic performance, which they admit he attended, where they drank semen blood.
[00:27:07.927 --> 00:27:16.892]  urine and more and then pour blood on the effigies of small babies and worship baphomet and they admit this is from Alistair Crowley in their own admissions.
[00:27:17.453 --> 00:27:19.334]  And that's just what they publicly are up to.
[00:27:19.354 --> 00:27:21.715]  The New York Times did a review of it, strangely enough.
[00:27:22.015 --> 00:27:28.119]  November 1st, on about how wonderful this lady is, who is a priestess of Alistair Crowley.
[00:27:28.139 --> 00:27:32.041]  Reportedly the most wicked man to ever live.
[00:27:32.781 --> 00:27:35.383]  So, there's that little enchilada for you.
[00:27:36.758 --> 00:27:40.679]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, let me get to the really big news here.
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:28:03.384]  I wanna challenge you to go to WikiLeaks itself and go to what came out Thursday night, Friday morning, or 48 hours ago or so, and to look at it for yourself because you have to actually, you see one where they're like, I've got these really great Beanie Babies, there's a lot of pressure and heat on us right now so we gotta move them quick.
[00:28:04.225 --> 00:28:04.565]  They're $20,000 a piece.
[00:28:07.652 --> 00:28:08.813]  I don't know.
[00:28:27.202 --> 00:28:29.182]  I've got three children, and they list their ages.
[00:28:29.862 --> 00:28:30.723]  I can show you this, you know.
[00:28:31.263 --> 00:28:32.783]  One's five, one's seven, one's eight.
[00:28:33.443 --> 00:28:37.344]  You know, they're gonna be in the hot tub for your entertainment at the farm.
[00:28:38.244 --> 00:28:44.265]  The children are being brought in by Uber and will be in the hot tub waiting for you after dinner for your entertainment.
[00:28:44.505 --> 00:28:45.945]  I mean, this is word for word, folks.
[00:28:46.505 --> 00:28:47.306]  And let me tell you something.
[00:28:47.946 --> 00:28:48.726]  It goes on and on.
[00:28:48.826 --> 00:28:50.006]  I spent hours.
[00:28:54.607 --> 00:28:55.027]  Hours.
[00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:58.931]  reading this crap.
[00:28:59.611 --> 00:29:00.812]  They argue over the menu.
[00:29:00.832 --> 00:29:03.133]  They're like, oh, I want hot dogs, not a hamburger.
[00:29:03.674 --> 00:29:09.176]  Okay, well, Obama shipped in $62,000 worth of hot dogs.
[00:29:09.237 --> 00:29:09.937]  Man, they're good.
[00:29:09.977 --> 00:29:11.078]  I'm looking for those hot dogs.
[00:29:11.478 --> 00:29:13.879]  Oh, I'm going to Hawaii to a hot dog stand.
[00:29:13.939 --> 00:29:14.519]  It's the best.
[00:29:14.699 --> 00:29:16.901]  Oh, my mouth is watering for those hot dogs.
[00:29:17.661 --> 00:29:18.001]  That's males.
[00:29:18.021 --> 00:29:18.221]  Oh my gosh.
[00:29:22.085 --> 00:29:22.845]  Everything's wonderful.
[00:29:23.506 --> 00:29:25.286]  This hot dog stand has hamburger too.
[00:29:25.346 --> 00:29:26.687]  It's cat and dog friendly.
[00:29:27.207 --> 00:29:31.028]  And law enforcement says this is... This is public!
[00:29:31.468 --> 00:29:35.630]  They're saying this is code garbage.
[00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:39.131]  Like if you smoke marijuana, you're like, I need some green.
[00:29:39.271 --> 00:29:40.051]  Green, yeah.
[00:29:43.953 --> 00:29:45.133]  I need some Mary Jane.
[00:29:45.153 --> 00:29:49.615]  Talk about 500 baseball cards.
[00:29:54.025 --> 00:29:59.588]  And it goes on, and on, and on, and then I found other stuff in the new WikiLeaks.
[00:30:01.208 --> 00:30:11.973]  Everybody started researching who's in the WikiLeaks, and they go Google these people, and it's like, see, these folks are all into showing their stuff, it's a lesser magic, are pimping everybody openly.
[00:30:12.674 --> 00:30:15.295]  So everybody's now researching who's in these, they go look them up.
[00:30:16.536 --> 00:30:22.807]  And they, like, have their Facebooks with them saying it's performance art with their little kids naked with them, going, it's art!
[00:30:22.887 --> 00:30:23.488]  First Amendment!
[00:30:23.809 --> 00:30:24.850]  I can be with naked kids!
[00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:27.695]  And that's what's in the Washington Post with the Podestas.
[00:30:29.218 --> 00:30:29.979]  Tony Podesta.
[00:30:31.089 --> 00:30:33.211]  Going, we've got, I don't know if I want to show this stuff.
[00:30:34.071 --> 00:30:38.274]  This is the lady painting with blood and crap about cutting herself and dead children.
[00:30:38.754 --> 00:30:39.935]  This is the Crowley lady.
[00:30:40.135 --> 00:30:43.157]  And it just goes on and on and on and on.
[00:30:44.258 --> 00:30:47.661]  And then we start searching and it's like they're in the Washington Post.
[00:30:48.001 --> 00:30:49.502]  They're in the New York Times, how great it is.
[00:30:49.902 --> 00:30:53.685]  Oh, we take lots of photos with our neighbor kids naked.
[00:30:53.745 --> 00:30:54.585]  It's just our art.
[00:30:54.685 --> 00:30:56.086]  You don't have a problem with our art, do you?
[00:30:56.367 --> 00:30:57.908]  It's just naked five-year-olds!
[00:30:59.343 --> 00:31:04.566]  And then in one Washington Post article it goes, Hillary refuses at the parties to be photographed with the children.
[00:31:04.706 --> 00:31:06.367]  Oh my God, look at this crap.
[00:31:09.069 --> 00:31:11.511]  Yeah, this is Lady Ga... Are you on air, Matt?
[00:31:11.531 --> 00:31:12.471]  Make sure you are, just punch yourself up.
[00:31:12.872 --> 00:31:23.458]  Yeah, yeah, this is Lady Gaga attending the event with a little five-year-old girl wearing devil horns where they're drinking blood with what appears to be dead bodies.
[00:31:24.479 --> 00:31:25.560]  And this is the little girl
[00:31:26.585 --> 00:31:31.011]  Absolutely, he was, you know, trauma-based, going into Stockholm Syndrome, totally scared.
[00:31:31.051 --> 00:31:35.016]  They then revert and go to all this, and this is what these people are into.
[00:31:35.917 --> 00:31:36.498]  Go ahead, Matt.
[00:31:38.183 --> 00:31:39.845]  You want to comment, go ahead.
[00:31:39.865 --> 00:31:42.427]  Yeah, this is a picture we found of Lady Gaga.
[00:31:42.447 --> 00:31:46.411]  She's wearing the same dress that we had of her at... At the ceremony.
[00:31:46.672 --> 00:31:48.053]  At the ceremony, drinking blood.
[00:31:48.353 --> 00:31:51.116]  And this is one of the children that was there.
[00:31:51.136 --> 00:31:53.618]  I found this on the Donald.
[00:31:53.719 --> 00:31:58.804]  It's a Reddit that does a lot of great investigative work on the internet.
[00:31:59.424 --> 00:32:08.012]  And, um, you know, they were authenticating this based on a lot of the shadows that the girl was casting, um, along with the shadows on her.
[00:32:08.513 --> 00:32:12.417]  It's, it's very odd that this girl is walking barefoot on wood chips.
[00:32:13.077 --> 00:32:16.500]  It's, scratch that, it's bizarre that she's there in the first place.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:22.246]  Listen, listen, listen, stuff you found, I've been back there in my office, I found stuff that I was like,
[00:32:22.546 --> 00:32:23.547]  Punching holes in the walls.
[00:32:23.567 --> 00:32:25.669]  There's holes in the walls right now in my office, okay?
[00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:28.492]  I mean, that's nothing what you found, okay?
[00:32:28.892 --> 00:32:31.134]  And I'm like, is this even legal?
[00:32:31.375 --> 00:32:33.036]  This is on the internet, not hidden.
[00:32:33.537 --> 00:32:37.420]  These people all, it's like they hide it in plain view.
[00:32:37.661 --> 00:32:40.483]  And I'm sitting there feeling evil, looking at this stuff.
[00:32:41.317 --> 00:32:43.999]  And then, I mean, I tore a door off the hinges and punched holes in the walls today.
[00:32:44.379 --> 00:32:44.619]  Oh yeah.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:50.343]  And so this is the image of Lady Gaga there at this satanic event.
[00:32:50.363 --> 00:32:50.923]  Yep, same dress.
[00:32:51.284 --> 00:32:54.206]  Yep, same dress that she was wearing with that child we just interviewed.
[00:32:54.226 --> 00:32:58.208]  With a reported woman, naked, dead, in a pool of blood, but it's all performance art.
[00:32:58.408 --> 00:33:01.310]  But then the woman that heads it up admits, well, when we do it private, it's not art.
[00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:02.091]  We do it for real.
[00:33:02.791 --> 00:33:03.892]  There's the high priestess right there.
[00:33:05.353 --> 00:33:07.434]  God, aren't you glad you're not these women or around these women?
[00:33:07.895 --> 00:33:08.315]  Go ahead, Matt.
[00:33:09.321 --> 00:33:17.586]  Oh yeah, this is something that is terrifying and you know, I would say that I'm probably one of the more skeptical people in the office when it comes down to a lot of this stuff.
[00:33:18.606 --> 00:33:24.570]  And I think the bottom line is, it's not that it's, it doesn't matter if it's real or if it's not.
[00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:29.753]  It's the fact that these guys act like it is and therefore they do these things, they do these ceremonies.
[00:33:30.393 --> 00:33:33.195]  Well, she admitted in her Reddit Ask Me Anything thing.
[00:33:33.235 --> 00:33:35.636]  She said, well, I do these publicly, but I do it for real privately.
[00:33:36.036 --> 00:33:36.676]  What do you make?
[00:33:36.696 --> 00:33:45.861]  I don't know if you've been through it all, but do you see the stuff where they're like, well, I want more hot dogs than hamburger, and I don't know if I want that many nuts in the sauce, and nuts means black people.
[00:33:46.422 --> 00:33:51.945]  I mean, it's like, well, this is an all nuts salad dressing.
[00:33:52.365 --> 00:33:59.609]  And they're like, well, I know, Podesta, you're a connoisseur of the right kind of, you know, pasta sauce, but do you really want this many nuts?
[00:34:01.733 --> 00:34:08.076]  Yeah, we're going to show on screen here a thread that uses kind of the same language.
[00:34:08.176 --> 00:34:13.639]  And like you said, this language isn't congruent with the type of language that they use in other emails.
[00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:14.099]  No, no, no.
[00:34:14.119 --> 00:34:18.581]  They've got intelligence agencies following them that have leaked info now on these, where they're going.
[00:34:18.661 --> 00:34:21.302]  Oh yeah, Obama just shipped in $62,000 of hot dogs to his party.
[00:34:23.243 --> 00:34:26.005]  And they're talking about child pornography.
[00:34:26.165 --> 00:34:27.926]  They're talking about human trafficking.
[00:34:28.326 --> 00:34:32.888]  This is the type of stuff that the NYPD is disgusted with.
[00:34:32.928 --> 00:34:36.710]  Those are real police officers that have integrity.
[00:34:37.071 --> 00:34:47.716]  You know, those are people that, you know, don't let these type of guys... Oh, let me tell you, you start hurting little kids, it flips switches in me that I... I mean, I am just done.
[00:34:47.736 --> 00:34:48.557]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[00:34:48.577 --> 00:34:50.338]  Go ahead.
[00:34:51.127 --> 00:34:51.347]  Oh yeah.
[00:34:51.768 --> 00:35:10.424]  And so, you know, it's understandable why, you know, a local department is going to hold the FBI's feet to the fire in this, because I don't know, as someone who tries to uphold the law, as someone doing that job, I don't know how they could live with themselves after this if they don't prosecute and put her away.
[00:35:10.444 --> 00:35:13.627]  And I'm sorry, it was $65,000 in hot dogs.
[00:35:16.305 --> 00:35:21.446]  But don't worry, they have hot dogs and hamburger for people that are cat and dog lovers.
[00:35:22.026 --> 00:35:23.366]  That ain't talking about food.
[00:35:23.426 --> 00:35:29.068]  That means you want male or female, and the law enforcement says this is classic pedophile code.
[00:35:29.428 --> 00:35:31.468]  Which again, why am I learning this?
[00:35:31.668 --> 00:35:33.748]  You know, it's like I see jokes and stuff on the internet.
[00:35:34.229 --> 00:35:40.410]  I don't want to know what a double-decker is, where somebody goes in a public restroom and craps in the top of the water stall to be gross.
[00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:42.410]  You know, but I know what that is because I read about it.
[00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:44.331]  Or a dirty Sanchez.
[00:35:44.351 --> 00:35:46.071]  But that's at least just gross, stupid stuff.
[00:35:46.271 --> 00:35:48.253]  You know, weird stuff people do.
[00:35:48.973 --> 00:35:49.714]  Didn't hurt anybody?
[00:35:49.894 --> 00:35:50.174]  Fine.
[00:35:50.214 --> 00:35:51.235]  You want somebody to crap on your face?
[00:35:51.275 --> 00:35:51.836]  That's your issue.
[00:35:51.856 --> 00:35:52.516]  Dirty Sanchez.
[00:35:53.197 --> 00:35:54.899]  I didn't know about this until I was like 30.
[00:35:55.419 --> 00:35:55.719]  You know?
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.201]  Like, what the hell?
[00:35:57.521 --> 00:36:02.085]  Now I'm having to learn this is standard pedophile nomenclature.
[00:36:02.185 --> 00:36:03.566]  What the hell?
[00:36:03.987 --> 00:36:05.268]  I mean, I'd always been told this.
[00:36:05.408 --> 00:36:05.988]  I knew this.
[00:36:06.449 --> 00:36:07.169]  I knew it went on.
[00:36:07.189 --> 00:36:08.931]  I knew the British government's run by it.
[00:36:09.311 --> 00:36:10.132]  That's all come out.
[00:36:10.332 --> 00:36:13.035]  But then you see Mother Jones attacking us.
[00:36:14.717 --> 00:36:19.661]  There was an article in Salon saying Alex Jones is dangerous and insane.
[00:36:20.081 --> 00:36:21.982]  Hillary's never committed a crime.
[00:36:22.002 --> 00:36:28.888]  You know, I mean, the thing is they've got armies of Renfields that serve them.
[00:36:28.908 --> 00:36:29.428]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:36:29.789 --> 00:36:32.271]  Oh yeah, we just put on screen WikiLeaks.
[00:36:32.991 --> 00:36:38.856]  Clinton campaign chair John Podesta caught throwing hot tub parties with children as young as seven years old.
[00:36:39.016 --> 00:36:39.837]  What is that from?
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.082]  That's a new email.
[00:36:43.923 --> 00:36:44.323]  Check it out.
[00:36:44.403 --> 00:36:45.083]  It's in your stack.
[00:36:45.124 --> 00:36:45.584]  That's what I mean.
[00:36:45.604 --> 00:36:46.825]  I just spent hours looking at this crap.
[00:36:46.865 --> 00:36:47.305]  Print it, print it.
[00:36:47.325 --> 00:36:48.826]  I mean, I got stuff even worse.
[00:36:48.846 --> 00:36:51.068]  That's what I mean.
[00:36:51.228 --> 00:36:53.310]  One of these damn things would make me have a heart attack.
[00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:55.211]  I mean, I got children.
[00:36:55.652 --> 00:36:59.935]  I mean, I am having serious compulsion and control right now not to just go to New York.
[00:36:59.995 --> 00:37:02.637]  I mean, I am just fed up, folks.
[00:37:02.717 --> 00:37:03.217]  I'm fed up.
[00:37:03.518 --> 00:37:05.879]  And I know other cops are fed up, too.
[00:37:05.919 --> 00:37:06.600]  Because here's the deal.
[00:37:12.984 --> 00:37:14.785]  I was going to get to some other point before you even showed me that.
[00:37:16.066 --> 00:37:16.386]  Oh yeah.
[00:37:16.846 --> 00:37:17.146]  Oh yeah.
[00:37:17.727 --> 00:37:17.987]  Oh yeah.
[00:37:18.247 --> 00:37:21.329]  Dew was telling me and I pulled it up and I didn't get it printed in time because we had to go on air live.
[00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:28.213]  It turns out Podesta and Dennis Hastert were best buddies and he keeps track of them and that's in the emails.
[00:37:28.253 --> 00:37:28.633]  I have that.
[00:37:28.673 --> 00:37:29.513]  It's in my printer actually.
[00:37:29.533 --> 00:37:30.454]  I forgot to get it in my office.
[00:37:31.935 --> 00:37:39.759]  Hastert... I had my sources tell me 15 years ago Dennis Hastert, before he was even a speaker, was a pedophile running huge networks in Illinois.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.040]  Here it is.
[00:37:42.557 --> 00:37:46.413]  And it turns out, in the emails, he's best buddies with Podesta!
[00:37:47.315 --> 00:37:52.940]  Then the other Podesta brother is in the Washington Post saying, I'm a radical artist.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.602]  I'll show naked kids if I want.
[00:37:54.822 --> 00:37:57.685]  See, because that's all their thing, like NAMBLA and the UN.
[00:37:58.105 --> 00:38:01.929]  It's an official member and your kids don't belong to you and the state has your kids.
[00:38:02.329 --> 00:38:06.693]  And Jocelyn Elders, reach down and show the kindergartner how to masturbate.
[00:38:07.714 --> 00:38:08.415]  Help them.
[00:38:08.635 --> 00:38:11.158]  It's all about the state's going to grab your kids wee-wee.
[00:38:11.238 --> 00:38:11.978]  I mean, it's like,
[00:38:12.719 --> 00:38:13.962]  These are freaks, man!
[00:38:14.102 --> 00:38:16.206]  I want cold beer and enchiladas!
[00:38:16.546 --> 00:38:17.588]  And to be on the lake!
[00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:19.973]  And to see kids having fun!
[00:38:19.993 --> 00:38:22.177]  I'm not attracted to kids!
[00:38:22.277 --> 00:38:23.359]  It pisses me off!
[00:38:23.922 --> 00:38:28.606]  Hey Alex, we've got what you're talking about coming up on screen right here.
[00:38:28.626 --> 00:38:31.869]  This is one of the Podesta emails you just referenced.
[00:38:32.489 --> 00:38:34.251]  I've stayed in touch with Denny Hastert.
[00:38:34.311 --> 00:38:36.913]  See, he's such good friends with the guy, he calls him Denny.
[00:38:37.634 --> 00:38:40.496]  Denny Hastert, the serial child molester.
[00:38:40.516 --> 00:38:42.398]  And it's wonderful to reconnect with Denny.
[00:38:42.418 --> 00:38:45.641]  Oh yeah, oh Denny, oh Denny.
[00:38:47.406 --> 00:38:51.348]  Imagine you're some five-year-old Denny, like the big fat blobberette is like, hey, Maria.
[00:38:51.908 --> 00:38:53.409]  And they want to steal kids' innocence, folks.
[00:38:53.649 --> 00:38:54.809]  This is a spiritual thing.
[00:38:55.409 --> 00:38:58.071]  There's only one thing that's bigger than raping a kid.
[00:38:58.131 --> 00:38:58.971]  It's killing them.
[00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:02.572]  And man, you read some of these, they're like, we got heat on us.
[00:39:02.592 --> 00:39:03.813]  We got a lot of these, we gotta move.
[00:39:03.853 --> 00:39:04.833]  You want them, you got them now.
[00:39:04.893 --> 00:39:05.754]  Twenty grand apiece.
[00:39:06.874 --> 00:39:08.055]  By the way, I've looked at the market.
[00:39:09.435 --> 00:39:10.736]  Raping a kid ain't twenty grand.
[00:39:13.789 --> 00:39:15.330]  One thing is and one thing only.
[00:39:15.931 --> 00:39:19.774]  That's dragging a big old double-edged knife right across those carotids.
[00:39:21.896 --> 00:39:22.897]  But hey, it's trendy!
[00:39:24.158 --> 00:39:25.479]  I'm a killer-kid-a-phobe!
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.121]  Matt, anything else?
[00:39:29.482 --> 00:39:37.586]  We're gonna keep you up to date with everything that keeps coming out because it just keeps coming out faster and faster and faster and faster.
[00:39:37.606 --> 00:39:39.507]  Oh, believe me, I couldn't sleep.
[00:39:39.527 --> 00:39:40.728]  I am so pissed.
[00:39:40.768 --> 00:39:42.248]  I don't mean to act dramatic, folks.
[00:39:42.308 --> 00:39:44.430]  It's normal that I threw up last night.
[00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:46.311]  It's normal I pulled the door off the hinges.
[00:39:46.511 --> 00:39:47.851]  It's normal I punched holes in the walls.
[00:39:48.191 --> 00:39:50.593]  Because I can't handle this anymore!
[00:39:51.033 --> 00:39:52.694]  I can't handle you damn people!
[00:39:53.474 --> 00:39:56.537]  I don't even hate Salon or Mother Jones attacking me for this.
[00:39:56.837 --> 00:39:58.959]  Why the hell would you sign on to this?
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.180]  What the hell?
[00:40:01.281 --> 00:40:02.302]  Are you involved?
[00:40:06.526 --> 00:40:07.987]  I haven't even gotten to one third of it.
[00:40:08.208 --> 00:40:09.108]  It's all laid out.
[00:40:13.332 --> 00:40:16.515]  They talk about Uber delivering to the farm in Levittsville.
[00:40:17.156 --> 00:40:19.378]  We plan to heat the pool so a swim is a possibility.
[00:40:20.572 --> 00:40:23.094]  We're using Uber service to transfer the children.
[00:40:24.514 --> 00:40:25.315]  11, 9 and almost 7.
[00:40:26.856 --> 00:40:30.258]  She'll have some further entertainment and they will be in the pool for sure.
[00:40:30.278 --> 00:40:38.323]  And then it just goes into all of it and then the talks of different sauces and different hamburger wieners.
[00:40:42.105 --> 00:40:46.728]  Don't worry, they've got wieners and hamburger and we've got, they cater
[00:40:49.124 --> 00:40:50.785]  They cater to cat lovers and dog lovers.
[00:40:51.425 --> 00:40:52.605]  You know, a cat's a girl.
[00:40:53.826 --> 00:40:54.586]  Dog's a boy.
[00:40:54.606 --> 00:40:58.728]  Even in, you know what a female fox is called?
[00:40:58.768 --> 00:40:59.448]  It's a vixen.
[00:40:59.468 --> 00:41:01.389]  You know what a male fox is called?
[00:41:01.429 --> 00:41:02.229]  It's a dog.
[00:41:07.411 --> 00:41:10.032]  And then we've got, what was the last one you just put up on screen?
[00:41:11.713 --> 00:41:17.615]  I mean, it's like watching the Democrats, they'll defend anything.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.821]  I mean, they didn't have to chop the babies up before they're born.
[00:41:23.983 --> 00:41:25.724]  But let's put the one before the last three.
[00:41:25.764 --> 00:41:31.487]  What was the one you put up just a few minutes ago that was the new bombshell that made me feel like I was about to have a heart attack?
[00:41:32.847 --> 00:41:37.310]  But it's okay, because they're... The Hastert thing, no, it was before the Hastert.
[00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:38.830]  Look, but it's alright.
[00:41:38.891 --> 00:41:41.312]  I mean, she's a regular pal.
[00:41:45.646 --> 00:41:48.647]  Report, Clinton linked to satanic rituals involving kidnapping children.
[00:41:49.707 --> 00:41:53.728]  And then they tied to her, because she's just doing all this satanic crap.
[00:41:54.648 --> 00:41:56.129]  We didn't say she was involved with the kids.
[00:41:56.709 --> 00:42:05.611]  We said this goes hand-in-glove, and then here come all the emails with the kids, which the NYPD we now know has been saying for a week before this came out.
[00:42:08.151 --> 00:42:09.612]  Why did the FBI say they had to reopen it?
[00:42:09.652 --> 00:42:14.453]  Because Hastert, excuse me, that's another convicted pedophile, because
[00:42:17.628 --> 00:42:37.694]  The husband of Uma Abedin, Anthony Weiner, was sending information to underage girls, who then bitched to the NYPD, who got his laptop, one laptop the feds didn't get, which had the 650,000 people on it, the blackmail, this is all blackmail.
[00:42:37.994 --> 00:42:38.755]  This is all blackmail.
[00:42:38.775 --> 00:42:39.635]  People know it's blackmail.
[00:42:40.155 --> 00:42:41.175]  It's like joining a gang.
[00:42:41.476 --> 00:42:45.937]  A lot of white supremacist gangs, Hispanic gangs, black gangs, they all do it, Asian gangs,
[00:42:47.042 --> 00:42:54.525]  You've got to commit some heinous crime to prove you're a made man so they have dirt on you with evidence of that to burn you anytime you want.
[00:42:54.545 --> 00:42:56.406]  You have to make your bones.
[00:42:57.186 --> 00:43:00.967]  To quote the Godfather movie, I made my bones when you were banging cheerleaders.
[00:43:02.108 --> 00:43:03.108]  I'm Mo Green.
[00:43:04.149 --> 00:43:04.689]  Well, good, Mo.
[00:43:06.969 --> 00:43:16.254]  Alex, what you're saying about that, this corruption, what is plaguing Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump just released a new powerful 30-second ad.
[00:43:16.554 --> 00:43:19.195]  I think it's something we might want to give a play real quick.
[00:43:19.215 --> 00:43:19.595]  That's right.
[00:43:19.655 --> 00:43:22.337]  We're going to, in fact, you've done massive preparation for the whole day.
[00:43:22.577 --> 00:43:23.657]  You were just on fire.
[00:43:23.958 --> 00:43:26.019]  You and Daria and the rest of the crew that came up here, I commend you.
[00:43:26.279 --> 00:43:28.100]  We've got a whole presentation coming up.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:31.782]  And then we're going to bring in Owen Schroer as well to break all this down.
[00:43:32.182 --> 00:43:32.682]  Absolutely.
[00:43:32.702 --> 00:43:34.043]  There is so much to get to here.
[00:43:34.363 --> 00:43:35.744]  I have a giant list of things.
[00:43:37.369 --> 00:43:38.270]  Here's what I'm telling everybody.
[00:43:41.072 --> 00:43:42.093]  Trump knows about this.
[00:43:42.254 --> 00:43:45.356]  Trump was recruited to fight these people because they know he has the courage.
[00:43:46.177 --> 00:43:47.919]  And that's why they've now tried to blame him.
[00:43:48.579 --> 00:43:50.661]  But notice it's always Jane Doe filings.
[00:43:51.062 --> 00:43:51.742]  They drop it.
[00:43:51.782 --> 00:43:53.184]  Three lawsuits just to claim it.
[00:43:54.144 --> 00:43:56.226]  Jerry Epstein, he never had a connection to him.
[00:43:56.246 --> 00:43:58.068]  He's had like dinner with him a couple times.
[00:43:58.088 --> 00:43:59.269]  The record's been checked.
[00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:00.811]  I know folks that know Trump.
[00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:03.011]  I mean, I did digging, folks.
[00:44:03.031 --> 00:44:04.032]  I never endorsed a candidate like this.
[00:44:04.052 --> 00:44:05.173]  I talked to former girlfriends.
[00:44:05.533 --> 00:44:07.375]  I ferreted around what he really thinks about black people.
[00:44:07.395 --> 00:44:10.597]  I'll tell you a little secret about Donald Trump.
[00:44:10.617 --> 00:44:11.578]  He really likes black people.
[00:44:11.618 --> 00:44:12.239]  He thinks they're cool.
[00:44:12.259 --> 00:44:13.039]  That's why he's here.
[00:44:13.059 --> 00:44:13.840]  I love their spirit.
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.121]  He hires black people.
[00:44:15.141 --> 00:44:16.322]  He's gotten awards for promoting them.
[00:44:17.803 --> 00:44:21.106]  And, you know, he likes black ladies.
[00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:32.573]  All the media's caught is he's a germophobe of white people, black people, you name it, and he does have anti-bacteria stuff constantly whenever he shakes your hand.
[00:44:32.873 --> 00:44:33.153]  That's it.
[00:44:33.673 --> 00:44:34.514]  That's the only thing.
[00:44:35.394 --> 00:44:36.074]  I checked into it.
[00:44:37.115 --> 00:44:40.056]  I mean, I can sell the stuff I got to tabloids, but I'm not going to do it.
[00:44:40.076 --> 00:44:41.656]  Even though it makes Trump look good.
[00:44:41.756 --> 00:44:45.678]  I'm just telling you the truth here that I checked into this guy.
[00:44:46.778 --> 00:44:49.219]  And they're out of ammo on him, folks, and they're panicking.
[00:44:50.359 --> 00:44:51.760]  They're absolutely panicking.
[00:44:54.019 --> 00:45:04.401]  Donald Trump eats half gallons of ice cream and eats like two or three steaks at night, and he sits there in his theater throwing popcorn in his face and it bounces off, and he likes to, after he's done all his work in a wife beater and shorts, eat like a pig.
[00:45:05.021 --> 00:45:05.361]  That's it.
[00:45:05.861 --> 00:45:06.402]  That's what he does.
[00:45:07.002 --> 00:45:09.402]  Doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, doesn't take aspirin.
[00:45:12.023 --> 00:45:16.644]  He eats like a pig at like nine at night, takes a few hours sleep, wakes up and works, goes back to sleep a few hours.
[00:45:17.604 --> 00:45:18.324]  Want the secrets of Trump?
[00:45:18.504 --> 00:45:19.624]  I know folks that know him intimately.
[00:45:20.385 --> 00:45:22.005]  He sleeps like three hours a day twice.
[00:45:22.694 --> 00:45:23.374]  That's the big secret.
[00:45:23.574 --> 00:45:24.455]  He sleeps twice a day.
[00:45:24.475 --> 00:45:26.316]  He eats like a pig.
[00:45:26.496 --> 00:45:30.418]  So do I. As I've gotten older, I think I'm Donald Trump or something.
[00:45:30.598 --> 00:45:31.458]  I do the exact same thing.
[00:45:32.679 --> 00:45:37.181]  So, that's the crime of Donald Trump is eating ice cream and steaks.
[00:45:38.142 --> 00:45:39.743]  You want somebody that wants ice cream?
[00:45:40.883 --> 00:45:43.404]  Or somebody that wants little kids and funds ISIS and Al Qaeda?
[00:45:43.865 --> 00:45:45.125]  These people are devils, folks.
[00:45:46.346 --> 00:45:49.928]  Now, I'm gonna go ahead and start getting these clips.
[00:45:49.948 --> 00:45:50.708]  There are a bunch of them.
[00:45:50.728 --> 00:45:52.109]  Donald Trump's argument for America.
[00:45:54.404 --> 00:45:55.425]  That was the first one you said.
[00:45:55.625 --> 00:45:58.326]  Donald Trump, unfit.
[00:45:59.306 --> 00:46:04.108]  Then we've got Obama gets angry in Fayetteville, North Carolina at a Trump supporter.
[00:46:04.368 --> 00:46:05.229]  They're really getting testy.
[00:46:05.269 --> 00:46:05.629]  They're scared.
[00:46:05.649 --> 00:46:06.169]  They know they're losing.
[00:46:06.189 --> 00:46:07.730]  They're about to have to steal the election.
[00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:08.950]  They know Trump's going to block it.
[00:46:09.331 --> 00:46:10.311]  Got a bunch of other clips.
[00:46:10.951 --> 00:46:12.072]  But here's what I'm getting at.
[00:46:12.492 --> 00:46:15.393]  I can't just sit here and watch them do this.
[00:46:15.773 --> 00:46:21.776]  There is by-the-minute WikiLeaks coming out that mainstream media is ignoring, that is bonafide and vetted, that they don't even deny.
[00:46:23.083 --> 00:46:25.884]  That shows a group of psychopathic crazies.
[00:46:26.465 --> 00:46:40.912]  Then you go check the WikiLeaks and you find them in the Washington Post, the LA Times, their own books, their own art displays, their own YouTubes, their own articles, their own... admitting it in your face!
[00:46:44.354 --> 00:46:48.116]  Well, who wants to bankrupt healthcare and rip off old people and tell them it's a free deal?
[00:46:48.657 --> 00:46:49.197]  Evil people.
[00:46:50.307 --> 00:46:51.128]  Who wants to do this?
[00:46:51.228 --> 00:46:53.030]  People that are into conning everyone.
[00:46:53.751 --> 00:46:54.692]  And that's the big secret.
[00:46:55.933 --> 00:46:56.935]  So it's an epic time to be alive.
[00:46:56.955 --> 00:46:58.176]  Let's go to this first clip.
[00:46:58.917 --> 00:47:00.519]  Here's one of the most powerful Trump ads ever.
[00:47:01.636 --> 00:47:06.219]  Decades of lies, cover-ups, and scandal have finally caught up with Hillary Clinton.
[00:47:06.499 --> 00:47:13.183]  Hillary Clinton is under FBI investigation again after her emails were found on pervert Anthony Weiner's laptop.
[00:47:13.443 --> 00:47:14.204]  Think about that.
[00:47:14.524 --> 00:47:21.769]  America's most sensitive secrets, unlawfully sent, received, and exposed by Hillary Clinton, her staff, and Anthony Weiner?
[00:47:22.009 --> 00:47:25.851]  Hillary cannot lead a nation while crippled by a criminal investigation.
[00:47:26.251 --> 00:47:28.593]  Hillary Clinton, unfit to serve.
[00:47:29.221 --> 00:47:31.423]  I'm Donald Trump and I approve this message.
[00:47:49.835 --> 00:47:55.117]  Okay, in a lot of ways, it's great to have a crew that... I mean, Matt, when he got here, he kind of liked the show, but he admitted it early.
[00:47:55.137 --> 00:47:56.057]  He thought it was a little bit of BS.
[00:47:56.418 --> 00:48:00.319]  Now the guy's, like, running around like a chicken with his head cut off, because, man, let me tell you something.
[00:48:00.819 --> 00:48:05.761]  You start really researching this... I was a mainline conservative 21 years ago when I got on there, folks.
[00:48:05.781 --> 00:48:07.102]  Then I was like a Ron Paul guy.
[00:48:07.442 --> 00:48:13.164]  And as stuff got deeper, I became this radical, not because I was radical, but because the information was radical.
[00:48:14.121 --> 00:48:16.883]  And now the FBI sounds like me, not because they're following Alex Jones.
[00:48:17.083 --> 00:48:19.385]  The media's like, the FBI's listening to Alex Jones.
[00:48:19.865 --> 00:48:20.626]  Eh, not really.
[00:48:21.306 --> 00:48:22.767]  They learn of this themselves.
[00:48:22.948 --> 00:48:25.089]  They tune in and go, that guy's dead on.
[00:48:25.109 --> 00:48:31.874]  I've had FBI agents, federal marshals, you name it, shake my hand and go, I used to think you were a kook, but it's all, it's worse, it's worse.
[00:48:31.894 --> 00:48:32.415]  Like, what do you mean?
[00:48:32.455 --> 00:48:33.716]  Just, you know, you know.
[00:48:33.736 --> 00:48:35.317]  I'm like, what is it?
[00:48:35.937 --> 00:48:37.458]  You know, I mean, it's bad, folks.
[00:48:37.579 --> 00:48:38.699]  They know more than I do now.
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:40.120]  And it's bad.
[00:48:41.321 --> 00:48:41.662]  It's bad.
[00:48:42.748 --> 00:48:44.849]  We are three days out, less than three days out.
[00:48:45.009 --> 00:48:48.571]  Pray... I'm going to say this right now before I go to this tape.
[00:48:48.631 --> 00:48:50.052]  It's called, uh, Obama Triggered.
[00:48:50.412 --> 00:48:50.932]  It's brand new.
[00:48:52.593 --> 00:48:53.394]  I know God's real.
[00:48:53.534 --> 00:48:54.434]  I know Christ is real.
[00:48:54.494 --> 00:48:57.736]  I know these evil people, when they hear the name Jesus Christ, they get upset.
[00:48:57.776 --> 00:49:01.618]  Hillary's in the Washington Post admitting she'll channel any dead person but Jesus Christ.
[00:49:01.958 --> 00:49:02.999]  She says she won't do that.
[00:49:03.559 --> 00:49:04.499]  They fear the name.
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:05.420]  They know it's real.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:07.181]  It's real, for whatever reason.
[00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:14.334]  So we need to pray to Jesus Christ to lead God and direct us and to heal this land, if that's God's will, and to have all the truth continue to come out.
[00:49:14.374 --> 00:49:16.355]  And we've asked for revolution against tyranny.
[00:49:16.635 --> 00:49:18.016]  We've asked for courage in the government.
[00:49:18.236 --> 00:49:18.857]  We're seeing it.
[00:49:19.277 --> 00:49:23.620]  So we ask for heads of protection upon the good people, the different agencies and the FBI.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:24.820]  They're doing the right thing.
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:27.222]  We ask for heads of protection on M4s and my family.
[00:49:29.961 --> 00:49:31.202]  It's hard, folks, going up against us.
[00:49:31.222 --> 00:49:32.223]  These people are pure evil.
[00:49:32.883 --> 00:49:33.683]  It's a spiritual battle.
[00:49:33.723 --> 00:49:38.085]  We pray for strength and provision as the enemy comes in like a flood and lifts us up as a standard against it.
[00:49:38.566 --> 00:49:45.829]  We pray in your son's precious name, Jesus Christ, for that blood on Calvary, on Golgotha, that frees us from this evil.
[00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:51.672]  We accept that and we take it upon ourselves to be good people and stand against evil no matter what happens.
[00:49:52.173 --> 00:49:54.234]  And we're sorry for all we've done in not being good enough.
[00:49:54.654 --> 00:49:58.156]  And please just heal our land because we don't want to be ruled by Satanists that hurt children.
[00:49:59.406 --> 00:50:03.409]  And kill children and sell their body parts and the communist Chinese just look at what we've become.
[00:50:04.991 --> 00:50:07.012]  So I pray for an unawakening God.
[00:50:07.092 --> 00:50:09.695]  Please heal our land or at least have a remnant protect us.
[00:50:10.155 --> 00:50:10.996]  We want to be good.
[00:50:11.056 --> 00:50:12.437]  We don't want to be part of these people.
[00:50:12.737 --> 00:50:13.958]  We're not turned over to evil.
[00:50:13.998 --> 00:50:16.800]  We love you and we're sorry that we've been in a trance.
[00:50:16.881 --> 00:50:17.601]  Please heal us.
[00:50:17.701 --> 00:50:18.722]  Open our hearts and minds.
[00:50:19.082 --> 00:50:20.223]  Please move upon the land.
[00:50:20.263 --> 00:50:21.404]  We can see it already happening.
[00:50:21.785 --> 00:50:24.427]  In your precious son's name, his blood, Jesus Christ.
[00:50:29.105 --> 00:50:32.746]  Let's go to the tape.
[00:50:33.466 --> 00:50:35.866]  We'll be back.
[00:50:36.687 --> 00:50:38.807]  We can't afford a commander in chief who insults POWs.
[00:50:38.827 --> 00:50:42.428]  Hold up, hold up, hold up.
[00:50:42.488 --> 00:50:43.368]  Hey, hold up, hold up.
[00:50:43.448 --> 00:50:46.069]  Hold up, it's okay.
[00:50:46.129 --> 00:50:47.029]  Hey, hold up.
[00:50:59.022 --> 00:50:59.342]  Hold up!
[00:50:59.362 --> 00:51:01.224]  Hold up!
[00:51:01.284 --> 00:51:06.348]  Hold up, hold up, hold up!
[00:51:06.368 --> 00:51:08.650]  Hey, listen, listen, listen, listen!
[00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:09.831]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[00:51:09.891 --> 00:51:10.111]  Listen up!
[00:51:27.375 --> 00:51:28.816]  Hey, everybody!
[00:51:28.916 --> 00:51:29.956]  Everybody!
[00:51:30.096 --> 00:51:30.877]  Hey!
[00:51:31.017 --> 00:51:31.337]  Hey!
[00:51:32.397 --> 00:51:33.418]  Listen up!
[00:51:33.518 --> 00:51:33.818]  Hey!
[00:51:34.078 --> 00:51:37.880]  I told you to be focused and you're not focused right now!
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:41.282]  Listen to what I'm saying!
[00:51:41.322 --> 00:51:42.522]  Hold up!
[00:51:42.602 --> 00:51:43.062]  Hold up!
[00:51:44.203 --> 00:51:44.623]  Hold up!
[00:51:44.723 --> 00:51:46.204]  Hold up!
[00:51:47.024 --> 00:51:49.966]  Everybody sit down and be quiet for a second!
[00:51:50.546 --> 00:51:52.907]  Everybody sit down and be quiet for a second!
[00:51:56.129 --> 00:51:56.809]  Now listen up.
[00:51:57.730 --> 00:51:58.770]  I'm serious, listen up.
[00:52:00.471 --> 00:52:06.053]  You've got an older gentleman who is supporting his candidate.
[00:52:06.193 --> 00:52:08.013]  He's not doing nothing.
[00:52:08.313 --> 00:52:12.115]  You don't have to worry about him.
[00:52:12.155 --> 00:52:15.996]  This is what I mean about folks not being focused.
[00:52:16.016 --> 00:52:22.538]  First of all, first of all, hold up.
[00:52:26.465 --> 00:52:26.825]  Hold up!
[00:52:28.166 --> 00:52:32.208]  First of all, we live in a country that respects free speech.
[00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:40.613]  So, second of all, it looks like maybe he might have served in our military and we gotta respect that.
[00:52:42.434 --> 00:52:45.515]  Third of all, he was elderly and we gotta respect our elders.
[00:52:47.776 --> 00:52:48.537]  And fourth of all,
[00:52:49.895 --> 00:52:50.756]  Don't boo!
[00:52:51.016 --> 00:52:52.297]  Boo!
[00:52:53.297 --> 00:53:01.583]  Imagine the different kinds of futures that are available depending upon who's elected on January 20th.
[00:53:02.683 --> 00:53:08.167]  Because by imagining it, I want you to think about every issue you care about.
[00:53:09.301 --> 00:53:14.984]  I want to see 10 million viewers tune in over the 50-plus hours, and that's where you come in.
[00:53:15.445 --> 00:53:17.166]  You are the heart and blood of the InfoWars.
[00:53:17.486 --> 00:53:28.752]  If you spread the link to InfoWars.com forward slash show and point out that this is the alternative new media, this is the rebellion, then all of you are riding right beside us, not behind us.
[00:53:29.113 --> 00:53:34.676]  So spread the word, my Paul Reveres, no matter where you live in the world, to Information Warfare Arms.
[00:53:35.016 --> 00:53:38.078]  The globalists are coming, and they will be met on the field.
[00:53:40.091 --> 00:53:43.132]  Oh, Troyer is with us for the next 30-40 minutes playing clips.
[00:53:43.172 --> 00:53:44.292]  Then Joe Biggs is coming in.
[00:53:44.312 --> 00:53:47.874]  I'm going to work on getting Roger Stone on because we had a bunch of preparation to cover this.
[00:53:47.894 --> 00:53:49.014]  We will in about 15 minutes.
[00:53:49.674 --> 00:53:51.475]  But this is what he warned of on Friday.
[00:53:51.555 --> 00:53:52.615]  Now it's a zero hedge.
[00:53:52.795 --> 00:53:55.456]  ISIS calls for slaughter of Americans on Election Day.
[00:53:55.916 --> 00:53:58.277]  Notice what came out on WikiLeaks just this week.
[00:53:58.877 --> 00:54:00.498]  The same people that fund Hillary fund ISIS.
[00:54:00.518 --> 00:54:01.579]  This is perfect timing.
[00:54:01.899 --> 00:54:03.781]  They know mainly conservatives and old folks hear this.
[00:54:03.801 --> 00:54:05.882]  They're trying to scare them away from polling places.
[00:54:06.603 --> 00:54:08.424]  They know the average Lib loves ISIS.
[00:54:08.864 --> 00:54:09.725]  Sees them as a friend.
[00:54:09.745 --> 00:54:11.966]  Look at mainstream media supporting radical Islam.
[00:54:11.986 --> 00:54:13.467]  We've got another clip coming up.
[00:54:13.688 --> 00:54:14.969]  What is it like for you, my friend?
[00:54:16.181 --> 00:54:25.486]  Owen up here, working at night, seeing all these emails come in, all these new WikiLeaks, unspeakable stuff we haven't even gotten to yet because I'm not even sure we can put this on air.
[00:54:26.367 --> 00:54:32.030]  Googling and searching people in the emails, they're all like in their Facebooks with naked kids on Facebook going, it's art!
[00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:33.031]  I'm with a naked kid!
[00:54:33.071 --> 00:54:36.893]  I mean, we've definitely, the cops are right, this is a sick network.
[00:54:37.413 --> 00:54:42.196]  Yeah, I'm just curious how the liberals are going to cover for this when... They're going to say Ben Affili is good now, watch.
[00:54:42.236 --> 00:54:45.018]  Yeah, it's just art, I guess, like the salon editors say.
[00:54:45.618 --> 00:54:46.760]  Well, I'll tell you this, Alex.
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:50.604]  I'll actually, I'll do this little teaser right here on air.
[00:54:51.566 --> 00:54:55.451]  We caught a female wild-aged Skrillex last night, Alex.
[00:54:56.638 --> 00:54:56.998]  Literally.
[00:54:57.258 --> 00:55:01.219]  Age Skrillex, female version, just as extreme, just as unbelievable.
[00:55:01.879 --> 00:55:05.720]  And I'm talking to this girl and I'm just, I'm trying to be nice.
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:08.720]  I'm saying, hey look, you like Hillary Clinton, we caught her.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:10.861]  She works with the same groups that fund ISIS.
[00:55:10.901 --> 00:55:11.341]  We caught her.
[00:55:11.361 --> 00:55:13.061]  She's even recognized it in her emails.
[00:55:13.581 --> 00:55:14.521]  And they freak out.
[00:55:14.561 --> 00:55:17.582]  They start pointing at me, cussing at me, calling me names.
[00:55:17.642 --> 00:55:17.942]  They're demons.
[00:55:18.202 --> 00:55:18.862]  And it's sad.
[00:55:18.962 --> 00:55:22.983]  It's truly sad that I'm trying to enlighten you
[00:55:23.903 --> 00:55:32.306]  I'm trying to give you information that I've found very enlightening, very important to me, and I'm trying to share it with you, and you just rebuke me.
[00:55:32.606 --> 00:55:33.346]  You insult me.
[00:55:33.926 --> 00:55:36.507]  It's total brainwashing in the flesh.
[00:55:36.867 --> 00:55:38.447]  It's manifested itself.
[00:55:38.928 --> 00:55:40.928]  It's unlike anything I've ever seen before.
[00:55:41.688 --> 00:55:46.910]  And in thinking about this election, Alex, I feel like there's three potentials that we face right now.
[00:55:47.692 --> 00:55:51.474]  One is Donald Trump gets in and there's going to be rioting.
[00:55:51.854 --> 00:55:56.876]  I think we all expect that from the George Soros funded groups, the Black Lives Matter type groups.
[00:55:56.896 --> 00:55:59.157]  They admit they're going to do it.
[00:55:59.177 --> 00:56:00.678]  Or let's say Hillary Clinton wins.
[00:56:01.218 --> 00:56:06.380]  You're going to be looking at a situation where she's either going to be... I feel like they'll false flag them to make us look bad.
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:07.741]  Well that'll be the false flag.
[00:56:08.221 --> 00:56:16.405]  That'll be the false flag is the riots happening because Trump won and they'll say it's the white racists and it's justified because white racists are the ones that voted Trump in.
[00:56:17.365 --> 00:56:23.767]  Or, think about this, if Hillary Clinton gets in, she could be under investigation by the FBI as she's getting inaugurated.
[00:56:24.327 --> 00:56:27.928]  And then the Soros groups activate if they ever try to remove her.
[00:56:27.948 --> 00:56:33.550]  Or, Obama could try to pardon her if the investigation is completed before she's inaugurated.
[00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:34.270]  Think about that!
[00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:38.531]  What if Obama tries to pardon Hillary Clinton before she comes president?
[00:56:38.551 --> 00:56:40.572]  That would be unprecedented in American history.
[00:56:40.992 --> 00:56:43.613]  We've never seen a presidential candidate come in
[00:56:44.053 --> 00:56:51.395]  We've never seen a presidential candidate come in on a raft of criminality, funding foreign governments, lying to Congress, satanic worship.
[00:56:51.775 --> 00:56:52.756]  I mean, what the hell?
[00:56:53.616 --> 00:56:53.996]  Literally.
[00:56:54.176 --> 00:56:55.297]  And we caught it all.
[00:56:55.377 --> 00:56:56.877]  We caught the satanic cults.
[00:56:57.137 --> 00:56:58.758]  We know who their favorite artist is now.
[00:56:58.818 --> 00:56:59.478]  They call it art.
[00:57:00.521 --> 00:57:02.642]  Even if you call it art, who is into this?
[00:57:02.782 --> 00:57:03.823]  Well, she admits it's not art.
[00:57:03.863 --> 00:57:04.724]  She says that's the cover.
[00:57:04.984 --> 00:57:05.804]  Who's into that, though?
[00:57:05.944 --> 00:57:07.826]  Like, what kind of a freak is into that type of art?
[00:57:08.186 --> 00:57:10.347]  Well, I mean, look, it's all about deceiving everybody.
[00:57:10.387 --> 00:57:14.970]  What do you make of all these WikiLeaks coming out where they go, we've got little kids in a pool for entertainment?
[00:57:16.527 --> 00:57:18.509]  I mean, how do you even cover that, Alex?
[00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:26.438]  How do you even come on here as a reporter and cover an email talking about these kids aren't even, I guess, not even teenagers yet.
[00:57:26.458 --> 00:57:27.099]  Seven years old.
[00:57:27.479 --> 00:57:29.742]  And they're talking about fun, entertainment, and pools.
[00:57:29.782 --> 00:57:31.524]  That's what the kids are there for, your entertainment?
[00:57:31.544 --> 00:57:33.586]  I mean, how do I even cover that?
[00:57:34.347 --> 00:57:35.648]  I guess you just pray.
[00:57:35.688 --> 00:57:40.530]  You just pray and you hope to God that there's hope left for these people.
[00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:47.194]  Not just the people that are using these kids for whatever entertainment they're talking about, but also the people that don't even know this is going on!
[00:57:47.914 --> 00:57:48.854]  That's just as much of the problem!
[00:57:48.874 --> 00:57:49.615]  Well, that's what makes me mad.
[00:57:49.655 --> 00:57:53.717]  Today I ran into folks I told about this who know me and they go, I just can't think about this, it's too scary.
[00:57:54.037 --> 00:57:54.737]  Well, exactly!
[00:57:55.098 --> 00:57:56.758]  I can't just sit here and ignore this.
[00:57:56.818 --> 00:58:00.340]  I mean, I can't sit here knowing all this and not come on air on Saturday.
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:02.681]  And I'm not saying, oh great, I'm working all the time.
[00:58:02.701 --> 00:58:03.622]  The point is, I can't stop.
[00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:09.173]  Uh, so, uh, well, I tell you, there's so many other clips I want to get to here.
[00:58:09.213 --> 00:58:09.673]  Stay here.
[00:58:10.013 --> 00:58:12.695]  We've got Clinton and ISIS funded by same money.
[00:58:12.715 --> 00:58:14.016]  This is a brand new Assange interview.
[00:58:15.011 --> 00:58:17.272]  From the major university that put it out.
[00:58:17.312 --> 00:58:19.412]  I point that out because they're going, it's Russian TV.
[00:58:19.432 --> 00:58:22.213]  Well, they picked up the piece and aired it just like we're airing it here.
[00:58:22.873 --> 00:58:24.533]  But this was what put out by Dartmouth.
[00:58:25.354 --> 00:58:28.374]  But it's Clinton and ISIS funded by same money.
[00:58:28.474 --> 00:58:33.956]  Assange interview with John Pilger, an Australian filmmaker, Dartmouth Films.
[00:58:34.716 --> 00:58:35.816]  So here it is.
[00:58:36.536 --> 00:58:38.337]  But ISIS is going to hit America.
[00:58:40.472 --> 00:58:45.295]  To make sure you don't get your precious Donald Trump, I mean this is so obvious, here it is.
[00:58:46.095 --> 00:58:54.500]  There's a early 2014 email from Hillary Clinton, so not so long after she left Secretary of State, to her campaign manager, John Podesta.
[00:58:56.101 --> 00:59:06.708]  That email, it states that ISIL, ISIS, is funded by Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
[00:59:07.886 --> 00:59:11.349]  The governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
[00:59:12.850 --> 00:59:27.939]  I think this is the most significant email in the whole collection and perhaps because Saudi and Qatari money is spread all over the place including into many media institutions.
[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:33.223]  All serious analysts know even the US government has
[00:59:34.364 --> 00:59:52.897]  Mentioned or agreed with that some Saudi figures have been supporting Isis funding Isis But the dodge has always been that's What it's just some rogue princes Using their cut of the oil money to do what they like, but actually the government disapproves
[00:59:54.372 --> 01:00:04.018]  But that email says that no, it is the governments of Saudi and Qatar that have been funding ISIS.
[01:00:04.358 --> 01:00:20.348]  The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the Saudis and the Qataris, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation, while Hillary Clinton,
[01:00:21.659 --> 01:00:30.883]  ...is Secretary of State, and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly to Saudi Arabia.
[01:00:31.723 --> 01:00:43.789]  Under Hillary Clinton, and Clinton emails reveal significant discussion about it, the largest ever arms deal in the world was made with Saudi Arabia, more than $80 billion.
[01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:54.477]  In fact, during her tenure as Secretary of State, total arms exports from the United States, in terms of their dollar value, doubled.
[01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:57.279]  Doubled.
[01:00:57.299 --> 01:01:13.232]  And, of course, the consequence of that is that this notorious terrorist jihadist group, called ISIL or ISIS, is created largely
[01:01:14.730 --> 01:01:19.834]  With money from the very people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation.
[01:01:21.516 --> 01:01:21.736]  Yes.
[01:01:26.059 --> 01:01:26.880]  That's extraordinary.
[01:01:27.781 --> 01:01:31.984]  Full interviews up on InfoWars.com, International Business Times, you name it, DrudgeReport.com.
[01:01:34.721 --> 01:01:36.322]  By the way, I want to just say this.
[01:01:36.722 --> 01:01:37.842]  I try not to cry on air.
[01:01:37.882 --> 01:01:41.003]  I used to do it once every five years, then once every year, then once every week.
[01:01:41.863 --> 01:01:47.525]  You're looking at satanic stuff with kids all day and it makes you sad for your country.
[01:01:47.545 --> 01:01:50.906]  And then I start talking about my personal relationship with Jesus Christ, which is my strength.
[01:01:52.067 --> 01:01:53.007]  That's why I start crying.
[01:01:53.027 --> 01:02:00.029]  So I have to learn not, I mean, I want to talk about Christ, but then I start talking about it, I get really emotional because it's just, I have a connection really opens up.
[01:02:00.729 --> 01:02:02.550]  And, uh, you know, that's why I'm willing to do this.
[01:02:03.567 --> 01:02:16.610]  I think about people that are totally damned from God and damned from Christ and it's just, it's just even thinking about these people makes me feel like closer to God but in a way also further away because I imagine what it's like to be in these wicked people's positions.
[01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:17.570]  Can you imagine?
[01:02:17.590 --> 01:02:20.791]  Because we know the Catholic Church pedophilias run in the whole thing.
[01:02:21.411 --> 01:02:21.871]  Took it over.
[01:02:22.111 --> 01:02:23.691]  They used blackmail to totally take the church over.
[01:02:23.731 --> 01:02:24.752]  They infiltrated, they did it.
[01:02:25.012 --> 01:02:25.812]  That's what these Satanists do.
[01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:28.552]  Hurting children is their sacrament.
[01:02:28.892 --> 01:02:37.803]  Christ talked about it when he said better to tie a giant boulder around your neck, a millstone, used for grinding wheat, around your neck and throw yourself in the ocean.
[01:02:38.404 --> 01:02:41.547]  It's sucking their souls, sucking their innocence, sucking their future.
[01:02:42.288 --> 01:02:50.352]  Sucking that they would meet a woman or a man they love when they were 16, 18, 20, whatever, and have an experience of passion and trust.
[01:02:50.952 --> 01:02:57.615]  It's ruining it with some pot-bellied, filthy demon, you know, possessing somebody, raping a child.
[01:02:57.695 --> 01:03:01.737]  I mean, it's demons raping children, like Genesis says.
[01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:03.658]  It's like God destroyed the earth.
[01:03:04.418 --> 01:03:05.959]  So, you think, oh, that's just the Bible.
[01:03:05.999 --> 01:03:07.200]  Well, they're doing it now!
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:09.741]  You know, whether this was real or not, boy, it's sure happening now.
[01:03:10.635 --> 01:03:12.616]  And so, this is biblical.
[01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:16.299]  And they're coming for our kids, and there's just nothing to lose, folks.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.821]  They've taken over the major universities.
[01:03:19.301 --> 01:03:20.042]  Look at Penn State.
[01:03:20.082 --> 01:03:20.942]  Look at Sandusky.
[01:03:21.022 --> 01:03:27.407]  I mean, he was raping little kids in the damn showers at high noon on Monday mornings.
[01:03:27.727 --> 01:03:31.310]  A field house is like a train station during the school year.
[01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:33.191]  I mean, the things are full of people.
[01:03:33.591 --> 01:03:34.552]  I played football, I know.
[01:03:35.862 --> 01:03:36.842]  This was institutional.
[01:03:36.862 --> 01:03:38.003]  They were selling them to donors.
[01:03:38.603 --> 01:03:39.444]  That all came out.
[01:03:39.504 --> 01:03:40.664]  Same thing with the British government.
[01:03:42.345 --> 01:03:43.565]  It's not that there's all these pedophiles.
[01:03:43.645 --> 01:03:53.730]  It's that they set up a system of control where they control everyone through the pedophilia and only let their club in because only someone controlled by the devil would want to hurt children.
[01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:54.090]  Got it?
[01:03:54.690 --> 01:03:58.332]  It's the price of admission is raping children.
[01:03:58.792 --> 01:04:00.793]  And by the way, that's to get into the high level.
[01:04:01.053 --> 01:04:04.695]  To go into the final level, you got to torture them and kill them.
[01:04:06.357 --> 01:04:07.157]  Now understand that.
[01:04:07.218 --> 01:04:12.661]  You look at the face of Sandusky, folks, with his house right by that playground.
[01:04:14.142 --> 01:04:19.805]  And I want to ask Salon and everybody else and Mother Jones, you really want to be signed up with these guys?
[01:04:21.826 --> 01:04:23.487]  Owen Troyer, one of our great reporters, is here.
[01:04:23.507 --> 01:04:26.429]  I have more clips I want to get to and a bunch of political news I want to get to.
[01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:27.530]  Before we get to this,
[01:04:28.874 --> 01:04:37.443]  Shifting out of the whole scandal, as people investigate people in the emails, it's like, oh my god, their own Facebook has them with naked kids, saying it's hard.
[01:04:37.483 --> 01:04:49.755]  You go to page after page, oh, Washington Post, CNN, New York Times, oh my god, the WikiLeaks is accurate, they're in public hanging out their shingle, that they're in the, we're in the kids group.
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:59.928]  Well, and the frustrating thing is, as the curtain is being pulled back on The Great Wizard of Oz, the people aren't even, they're not even watching, they're not even seeing it.
[01:04:59.988 --> 01:05:04.151]  It's like, I don't know if they're watching a baseball game, or if they're watching a... Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun!
[01:05:04.171 --> 01:05:04.852]  NFL Tonight!
[01:05:04.892 --> 01:05:05.512]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:05:05.532 --> 01:05:06.333]  I don't know what they're doing.
[01:05:06.353 --> 01:05:09.796]  Four right-head, spoiled, rotten narcissists running around bitching.
[01:05:10.036 --> 01:05:11.137]  They're only making a hundred million.
[01:05:11.457 --> 01:05:17.700]  So, but the pseudo-intellectuals will try to argue with you, and if you tell them, hey look, you know, we caught Hillary Clinton.
[01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:30.446]  First of all, she's here campaigning, saying today that she stands for women's rights, LGBT rights, but we know that she takes money with the Clinton Foundation from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, countries that murder these people.
[01:05:30.526 --> 01:05:32.027]  They will murder you if you're gay.
[01:05:32.147 --> 01:05:34.908]  They'll cut your head off if you're a woman and you're unfaithful.
[01:05:35.248 --> 01:05:38.411]  Okay, so don't sit here and tell me... It's like Uma cut the genitals off.
[01:05:38.431 --> 01:05:39.732]  They're into anything that's forced.
[01:05:40.092 --> 01:05:50.300]  You know, speaking of Uma Abedin, they're looking into Anthony Weiner's laptop right now for allegedly child sex rings is what he's being investigated for.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.220]  That's official now.
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:52.241]  It's official.
[01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:54.663]  Okay, so then here's what you have to ask yourself.
[01:05:54.683 --> 01:05:55.564]  Yeah, that's the big news.
[01:05:56.104 --> 01:06:00.888]  The media is acting like we're making this up and Drudge made this up, this is in the news.
[01:06:01.408 --> 01:06:05.311]  So here's my question, if you're a Hillary Clinton supporter, because you can only have this two ways.
[01:06:05.851 --> 01:06:10.715]  And this investigation, just like Hillary's investigation, is just a big motzball kind of hanging over this election right now.
[01:06:11.355 --> 01:06:14.777]  But let's say that they catch Anthony Weiner, which they already got him, folks.
[01:06:15.118 --> 01:06:20.381]  But they charge him, and he had whatever ties to this child sex ring.
[01:06:20.501 --> 01:06:24.244]  Okay, so you have to face one of two realities if you're a Hillary Clinton supporter.
[01:06:24.604 --> 01:06:26.786]  One, either she was aware
[01:06:27.446 --> 01:06:46.935]  That this child sex ring was going on, she was either aware of this, her and her top aide Uma Abedin, or her and her top aide Uma Abedin are so oblivious that this was going on right under their noses, Anthony Weiner running a child sex operation right under their noses without them knowing.
[01:06:47.175 --> 01:06:51.196]  So again, I ask the Hillary Clinton supporter, what reality are you going to accept?
[01:06:51.497 --> 01:06:54.558]  Are you going to accept the reality that Hillary Clinton is completely oblivious?
[01:06:54.858 --> 01:07:00.761]  Or are you going to accept the reality that Hillary Clinton knowingly allowed a child's sex ring to get operated?
[01:07:00.861 --> 01:07:15.209]  I've got her in the Washington Post in 2004, September 23rd, because they want to, again, the powers throwing, oh yeah, bloody dead people, yeah, naked little kids, and then Hillary, the very last page,
[01:07:17.663 --> 01:07:19.105]  Let me show TV viewers this.
[01:07:19.545 --> 01:07:20.987]  They've taken this off the Washington Post.
[01:07:21.487 --> 01:07:21.827]  Friday.
[01:07:22.388 --> 01:07:23.169]  They edited it out?
[01:07:23.369 --> 01:07:23.749]  They pulled it.
[01:07:23.769 --> 01:07:25.371]  You have to go to the Wayback Machine on Google.
[01:07:26.552 --> 01:07:35.081]  Hillary Clinton's visit when she ducked and tiptoed around the work, lest any photo opportunity capture her alongside the naked figure of a child.
[01:07:37.103 --> 01:07:38.544]  You know what's funny about this, Alex?
[01:07:39.085 --> 01:07:41.127]  What were we talking about a week or two ago?
[01:07:42.383 --> 01:07:46.965]  Project Veritas videos exposing how Hillary Clinton incites violence via her campaign.
[01:07:47.585 --> 01:07:52.507]  Now, we're sitting here talking about a Hillary Clinton campaign running child sex operations.
[01:07:52.827 --> 01:07:53.587]  What's next week?
[01:07:53.607 --> 01:07:55.588]  I mean, this is a joke!
[01:07:55.848 --> 01:07:57.069]  When are people gonna wake up?
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.201]  This is right in front of your face.
[01:08:00.261 --> 01:08:02.021]  Again, the curtain's been pulled back.
[01:08:02.581 --> 01:08:03.762]  Thousands of totos now.
[01:08:03.822 --> 01:08:04.902]  It's not just Alex Jones.
[01:08:05.142 --> 01:08:06.302]  There are thousands of totos.
[01:08:06.323 --> 01:08:06.663]  Millions.
[01:08:06.983 --> 01:08:10.364]  There's now Donald Trump who's like a lion pulling the curtain back.
[01:08:10.664 --> 01:08:11.484]  And he's got all this attention too.
[01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:11.764]  I love that.
[01:08:11.804 --> 01:08:12.244]  I love you.
[01:08:12.504 --> 01:08:12.744]  He is.
[01:08:12.764 --> 01:08:14.305]  He's like a lion pulling the curtain back.
[01:08:14.385 --> 01:08:15.725]  And he's gotten the most attention.
[01:08:15.785 --> 01:08:21.787]  He's awoken more people probably in the last year, Alex, than you woke in like 20 years on air.
[01:08:21.807 --> 01:08:22.347]  That's the power.
[01:08:22.367 --> 01:08:23.068]  That's exponential.
[01:08:23.088 --> 01:08:23.988]  That's the power he's had.
[01:08:24.488 --> 01:08:29.294]  I mean, that's why I, despite whatever, whatever... And that's why they're crapping his pants.
[01:08:29.914 --> 01:08:33.899]  They are crapping their pants because Donald Trump loves us.
[01:08:33.959 --> 01:08:34.960]  Let me just tell you his message.
[01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:36.161]  He loves us.
[01:08:36.262 --> 01:08:37.243]  He loves InfoWars.
[01:08:37.483 --> 01:08:37.943]  He loves you.
[01:08:38.652 --> 01:08:43.653]  And let me just... They can't stand that, because Donald Trump wants ice cream and T-bone steak and a free country.
[01:08:44.073 --> 01:08:46.914]  He doesn't want to bend your kid over and rape him, so that's why he's not cool.
[01:08:47.234 --> 01:08:50.595]  He's the guy who made it in the private sector, a self-made man.
[01:08:50.655 --> 01:08:54.256]  He wants you to have the same opportunities he had, and that's what America's all about.
[01:08:54.576 --> 01:08:56.496]  But I'm glad you talked about how scared they are.
[01:08:56.856 --> 01:09:04.738]  You know, yesterday we had Barack Obama meltdown at a rally for Hillary Clinton, and then today, Hillary Clinton is melting down at her rally.
[01:09:04.838 --> 01:09:05.599]  We're gonna play that next.
[01:09:05.639 --> 01:09:06.439]  You guys have that on the computer?
[01:09:06.459 --> 01:09:09.522]  A week ago they had to cancel a Tim Kaine event because nobody shows up!
[01:09:09.942 --> 01:09:12.905]  Oh yeah, they gotta have Jay-Z play so she gets 10,000.
[01:09:13.205 --> 01:09:14.186]  Her normal crowd's 200.
[01:09:14.226 --> 01:09:15.267]  We've got those videos too.
[01:09:15.627 --> 01:09:16.949]  And a lot of preparations to put into this.
[01:09:16.969 --> 01:09:19.471]  I haven't gotten to half of what Matt's put together.
[01:09:19.511 --> 01:09:21.773]  But before we do it... These people are failing!
[01:09:22.093 --> 01:09:22.473]  Exactly.
[01:09:22.493 --> 01:09:28.439]  Let's start getting to these stacks of news here that Matt... I put together most of my stacks, but Matt does a great job of angles I haven't hit.
[01:09:28.719 --> 01:09:29.339]  So let's look at it.
[01:09:29.379 --> 01:09:29.720]  Here it goes.
[01:09:31.121 --> 01:09:31.962]  Pop it anytime, Matt.
[01:09:32.442 --> 01:09:33.483]  Sources, U.S.
[01:09:33.623 --> 01:09:37.206]  intel warning of possible Al-Qaeda attacks in the U.S.
[01:09:37.847 --> 01:09:44.833]  days after Roger Stone says they may activate Al-Qaeda to attack in key battleground states, Texas, Virginia, and New York.
[01:09:45.885 --> 01:09:47.626]  By the way, they're still Texas.
[01:09:48.047 --> 01:09:48.667]  So we've got that.
[01:09:48.707 --> 01:09:49.728]  That's CBS News.
[01:09:50.168 --> 01:09:51.589]  Hillary, you've leaked email.
[01:09:51.929 --> 01:09:54.031]  Saudi Arabia and Qatar are funding ISIS.
[01:09:54.671 --> 01:09:55.752]  And that's what WikiLeaks is saying.
[01:09:55.812 --> 01:09:58.414]  Assange, Clinton and ISIS funded by same group.
[01:09:58.794 --> 01:10:00.035]  Trump won't be allowed to win.
[01:10:00.676 --> 01:10:03.738]  He said they'll use ISIS to attack so Trump can't win.
[01:10:04.974 --> 01:10:08.255]  Turns out WikiLeaks taped that interview two weeks ago with Pilger.
[01:10:08.295 --> 01:10:09.015]  It came out today.
[01:10:09.855 --> 01:10:12.135]  So they know Intel is feeding Assange.
[01:10:12.676 --> 01:10:14.736]  US Intel battling for America.
[01:10:14.756 --> 01:10:18.097]  I'm not defending US Intel like they're perfect, but they're not pedophiles on average.
[01:10:18.377 --> 01:10:19.257]  They're battling.
[01:10:19.477 --> 01:10:21.617]  This battle, I can't believe the conversations I had yesterday.
[01:10:21.637 --> 01:10:23.318]  I'm not going to say I'm on air right now.
[01:10:24.518 --> 01:10:25.038]  We've got that.
[01:10:25.338 --> 01:10:27.119]  Now let's look at why not to trust the polls.
[01:10:27.859 --> 01:10:28.619]  This stack of news.
[01:10:29.807 --> 01:10:33.728]  Presidential pollsters, political contributors, heavily for Hillary.
[01:10:33.788 --> 01:10:36.748]  Almost all the pollsters gave exclusively to Hillary.
[01:10:39.069 --> 01:10:40.969]  That is admitted mainstream news.
[01:10:41.369 --> 01:10:43.049]  Yahoo News and the Washington Post.
[01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:44.050]  Here's another one.
[01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:46.130]  Are the polls rigged against Trump?
[01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:50.031]  All of these widely divergent surveys cannot possibly be correct.
[01:10:50.051 --> 01:10:53.191]  Meanwhile, the Googlebots show a huge win by Trump.
[01:10:53.431 --> 01:10:55.192]  Of course, he gets crowded with 30,000, she gets 200.
[01:10:58.078 --> 01:11:02.441]  ABC poll oversamples Dems by 9% claims Hillary leading.
[01:11:03.541 --> 01:11:06.403]  So that's how they're claiming that she's leading.
[01:11:06.783 --> 01:11:11.426]  Trump now leading Hillary in poll biased against him.
[01:11:11.706 --> 01:11:14.228]  So that's got to absolutely panic them.
[01:11:14.943 --> 01:11:16.703]  You know, Alex, there's something that's strange to me.
[01:11:17.564 --> 01:11:23.605]  When I was on the outside of all this, when I wasn't paying attention to current events or politics, I was totally indifferent.
[01:11:23.645 --> 01:11:25.225]  I was on the sports plantation.
[01:11:26.066 --> 01:11:27.266]  I wouldn't have had a clue, okay?
[01:11:27.666 --> 01:11:30.607]  But as soon as I went in... The sports plantation.
[01:11:30.927 --> 01:11:34.768]  As soon as you used knowledge, you were using everything about sports to the real world.
[01:11:34.808 --> 01:11:35.168]  It was like, wow!
[01:11:35.788 --> 01:11:41.814]  I can be an expert in stock markets, and economies, and the world, and be successful, and how stuff really works.
[01:11:42.115 --> 01:11:48.181]  Instead of spending my male energy to figure stuff out and war game on sports, I'm doing it in the real world!
[01:11:48.722 --> 01:11:57.070]  But the crazy part of it is, there's people that have been following Fox News, or CNN, or MSNBC for years, or just tuning in to drive-by media viewers.
[01:11:57.631 --> 01:11:59.211]  They actually believe this crap!
[01:11:59.832 --> 01:12:02.813]  The first time I saw it, I was like, this is total bullcrap.
[01:12:02.833 --> 01:12:03.553]  I don't believe CNN.
[01:12:03.573 --> 01:12:05.173]  That's right, you never even paid attention.
[01:12:05.473 --> 01:12:06.794]  Once you saw it, it was comical.
[01:12:07.514 --> 01:12:08.494]  I mean, it changed my life.
[01:12:08.654 --> 01:12:10.655]  I was like, I have to fight these liars.
[01:12:11.155 --> 01:12:12.535]  These people are brainwashing America.
[01:12:12.555 --> 01:12:13.236]  And you get a key there.
[01:12:13.436 --> 01:12:17.597]  Most media, 80% is targeted to keep people distracted, never even thinking.
[01:12:18.037 --> 01:12:20.838]  Only 20% of the public, or less now, looks at MSM.
[01:12:21.698 --> 01:12:24.582]  But, again, they're trying to keep thinkers on the plantation.
[01:12:25.083 --> 01:12:32.032]  Once people I found that were never even in the thinker category come into it, they're better than folks that have been in the brainwashing plantation.
[01:12:32.392 --> 01:12:35.737]  The fact that you were so virgin, didn't even care and saw it, you got it.
[01:12:35.777 --> 01:12:36.338]  See what I'm saying?
[01:12:36.638 --> 01:12:39.061]  And it's strange because it's like, it's like...
[01:12:39.724 --> 01:12:42.245]  Hey, why do you think Hillary Clinton is going to win?
[01:12:42.345 --> 01:12:43.825]  Well, she's dominating in the polls.
[01:12:44.245 --> 01:12:45.345]  You mean the television polls?
[01:12:45.585 --> 01:12:46.626]  Yeah, yeah, the television polls.
[01:12:47.146 --> 01:12:48.886]  Oh, oh, you know they rigged those polls.
[01:12:49.667 --> 01:12:49.967]  What?
[01:12:50.327 --> 01:12:52.127]  It's like some sort of absurd notion.
[01:12:52.247 --> 01:12:56.408]  And then you can show them the methodology where they're adding 9 to 50 points to her.
[01:12:56.548 --> 01:13:02.930]  Just like I can show you, go to the Clinton Foundation, look at her major donors, Saudi Arabia is all over it!
[01:13:03.490 --> 01:13:06.052]  And then she says that she's for women's rights, folks.
[01:13:06.092 --> 01:13:07.893]  Go look at women's rights in Saudi Arabia, okay?
[01:13:08.113 --> 01:13:09.934]  I mean, this woman is a total hypocrite.
[01:13:10.195 --> 01:13:17.640]  In her own email, she recognizes the fact that the Saudi government funds ISIS, and then she takes money from them, okay?
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:18.821]  It's the same thing.
[01:13:18.861 --> 01:13:19.681]  You just go look!
[01:13:20.322 --> 01:13:25.105]  I mean, I'm not some sort of mathematician, genius-level stuff here.
[01:13:25.145 --> 01:13:26.186]  Oh, and let me ask you this question.
[01:13:26.206 --> 01:13:26.666]  I'm literate!
[01:13:27.697 --> 01:13:30.119]  Knowing the WikiLeaks, who I totally apologize to.
[01:13:30.199 --> 01:13:31.521]  I blew up because I wanted stuff early.
[01:13:31.581 --> 01:13:32.381]  I can't stand Hillary.
[01:13:32.462 --> 01:13:32.822]  I get it.
[01:13:33.162 --> 01:13:34.584]  It was late.
[01:13:34.724 --> 01:13:36.726]  We've been up for, you know, 18 hours.
[01:13:37.086 --> 01:13:38.407]  But they're more sophisticated than I am.
[01:13:38.567 --> 01:13:39.408]  I mean, I'll give it to them.
[01:13:39.809 --> 01:13:40.589]  The drip, drip, drip.
[01:13:40.609 --> 01:13:41.750]  The more hardcore stuff later.
[01:13:42.071 --> 01:13:44.673]  Make Democrats sign on to all the evil to expose the whole system.
[01:13:44.973 --> 01:13:46.094]  To show how rotten it is.
[01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:47.075]  To give people a chance.
[01:13:47.436 --> 01:13:47.936]  They've done it.
[01:13:48.156 --> 01:13:48.797]  They are masters.
[01:13:48.897 --> 01:13:49.437]  We're good to go.
[01:14:04.827 --> 01:14:07.949]  But hats off, okay, Assange, literally, I kiss your ass, you're amazing.
[01:14:09.229 --> 01:14:19.334]  If they metrically increase the hammer blows, three days out, we're already seeing devastating pedophile evidence, devastating criminal activity, Satanism.
[01:14:19.734 --> 01:14:21.675]  What's coming out the next three days?
[01:14:21.956 --> 01:14:24.077]  And Assange said, go ahead and elect her.
[01:14:24.317 --> 01:14:28.859]  The worst stuff comes after, because he doesn't want to hurt America or the economy.
[01:14:29.179 --> 01:14:38.742]  What they're going to bring out is so devastating, if America makes the wrong choice and elects her, or lets them steal it, that it's supposedly 50 times worse.
[01:14:38.822 --> 01:14:40.262]  Now, this is their own words.
[01:14:40.702 --> 01:14:42.403]  What's 50 times worse?
[01:14:43.843 --> 01:14:48.424]  Mr. Troyer, what is 50 times worse than devil worship and raping kids?
[01:14:50.145 --> 01:14:52.446]  It going on for hundreds of years, I think.
[01:14:53.026 --> 01:14:53.606]  Nuclear war?
[01:14:54.807 --> 01:14:56.108]  And I think that... Killing kids?
[01:14:56.369 --> 01:14:57.270]  Think about this, Alex.
[01:14:57.390 --> 01:15:00.133]  It's come to a point where time has shrunk.
[01:15:00.733 --> 01:15:02.155]  Time is like in a vacuum right now.
[01:15:02.175 --> 01:15:02.395]  Compacted.
[01:15:02.635 --> 01:15:05.018]  Where you're saying what's going to come out in the next three days.
[01:15:05.118 --> 01:15:13.627]  Okay, so if you go back and you listen to Alex Jones' broadcast from years and years ago, it'll be like, oh wow, that's come true, that's come true, that's come true, that's come true here years later.
[01:15:13.907 --> 01:15:15.468]  But it's reaching a head now where
[01:15:16.089 --> 01:15:19.311]  Things are coming true the next day, the next week.
[01:15:19.751 --> 01:15:20.652]  Time is shrinking.
[01:15:21.032 --> 01:15:28.257]  So, I think that this ultimately could be, I mean, if the FBI really goes after- That's right, they're not waiting ten years for it to come out of the Hillary's Devil Worshipper.
[01:15:28.417 --> 01:15:28.877]  It's all now.
[01:15:28.897 --> 01:15:29.798]  They're getting it a month later.
[01:15:30.118 --> 01:15:31.579]  And now it's a week.
[01:15:31.599 --> 01:15:32.820]  Now it's a day.
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:34.381]  It's all coming down right now.
[01:15:34.441 --> 01:15:35.362]  They know they have too long.
[01:15:35.402 --> 01:15:36.142]  I can't even sleep!
[01:15:36.482 --> 01:15:36.963]  It's a joke!
[01:15:37.483 --> 01:15:39.083]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:15:39.364 --> 01:15:43.245]  We can't even properly cover and digest Project Veritas.
[01:15:43.385 --> 01:15:45.985]  I'm looking at Veritas, Drudge.
[01:15:46.805 --> 01:15:50.927]  I'm in there just like... It's not even the WikiLeaks now.
[01:15:50.987 --> 01:15:53.847]  It's like everyone around Hillary's with little naked kids.
[01:15:54.247 --> 01:15:57.208]  I mean, like, Jesus, arrest her immediately!
[01:15:57.388 --> 01:15:59.889]  Do you think... I mean, I can't handle it anymore.
[01:16:00.769 --> 01:16:06.637]  I mean, the only thing I could think of that they could expose out of this would be the population control agenda.
[01:16:06.998 --> 01:16:08.360]  Now, I don't know how we can expose that.
[01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:11.464]  Oh, yeah, I guess a bunch of things like, oh, we've brain-damaged y'all, but they already wrote a book.
[01:16:11.504 --> 01:16:11.965]  Well, that's true.
[01:16:11.985 --> 01:16:14.268]  The White House science czar admits they brain-damaged us and laughs.
[01:16:14.368 --> 01:16:15.250]  I get it, but you know what?
[01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:16.171]  I bet that's in there.
[01:16:16.331 --> 01:16:17.572]  And how vaccines are doing well.
[01:16:17.852 --> 01:16:19.273]  Oh look, more of the kids are dying.
[01:16:19.613 --> 01:16:20.994]  Infant mortality is very high now.
[01:16:21.154 --> 01:16:22.455]  Oh good, their IQs are low.
[01:16:22.475 --> 01:16:26.038]  Because it's already in the WikiLeaks, keep them dumb, keep them stupid, make them poor.
[01:16:26.058 --> 01:16:27.278]  I bet you're right.
[01:16:27.439 --> 01:16:29.720]  I bet it's how they're killing us with vaccines.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:30.701]  I think you're right.
[01:16:30.861 --> 01:16:36.585]  I think that's the only length that this could possibly go farther is the population control agenda.
[01:16:37.605 --> 01:16:38.326]  Because here's the thing.
[01:16:38.706 --> 01:16:42.569]  Who do you think's sitting back though, because WikiLeaks have been told by high level sources
[01:16:43.149 --> 01:16:44.211]  I mean, high-level folks.
[01:16:44.231 --> 01:16:45.953]  These conversations I have now are so crazy.
[01:16:45.973 --> 01:16:47.235]  People I'm having with you wouldn't even believe it.
[01:16:47.255 --> 01:16:48.116]  They've come out of the shadows.
[01:16:48.457 --> 01:16:50.299]  They were never for this the whole time.
[01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:57.189]  What else are they going to bring out when the whole power structure that isn't evil is now opposing them?
[01:16:58.925 --> 01:16:59.845]  I mean, that's a great question.
[01:17:00.226 --> 01:17:11.471]  Well, and I think the fact that the American people have gotten involved now is empowering a lot of the good people in government that were either too scared to stand up or, you know, whatever it is, didn't think that anyone would have their back.
[01:17:11.491 --> 01:17:16.073]  So I think, you know, the soft coup that Plutonic talks about is actually manifesting itself right now.
[01:17:16.693 --> 01:17:19.535]  But, you know, think, this is gonna be the crazy thing, Alex.
[01:17:20.055 --> 01:17:25.519]  So, okay, so now we're getting this stuff about the Satanism and the pedophiles, but it still doesn't affect the average human.
[01:17:25.539 --> 01:17:29.161]  The average human that's watching SportsCenter right now isn't affected by this, it doesn't matter.
[01:17:29.542 --> 01:17:39.228]  But let's say that we do find out that they're in the WikiLeaks, if we find this hard evidence that they're talking about population control, and it, obviously, that will affect you.
[01:17:39.248 --> 01:17:40.429]  I mean, that's affecting everybody.
[01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:41.510]  Will they care then?
[01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:46.053]  Will they care then when they know it's an attack on them?
[01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:51.484]  Well, like Obamacare was admitting, thank God their dumb effers were ripping him off.
[01:17:51.765 --> 01:17:52.387]  Jonathan Gruber.
[01:17:53.635 --> 01:17:54.275]  Ezekiel Emanuel.
[01:17:54.535 --> 01:17:55.336]  Just the guys that wrote it.
[01:17:55.916 --> 01:18:04.980]  Yeah, why does Ezekiel Emanuel go on TV two weeks ago and laugh at us and laugh and say we're dumbasses, I highly doubt your money, he he he, like dun dun dun dun on his bicycle.
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:07.301]  It's reached, it's honestly reached a point.
[01:18:07.841 --> 01:18:11.343]  They can't, like you said, they can't pull the cover back over the Wizard of Oz.
[01:18:11.403 --> 01:18:12.483]  The cover's already ripped off.
[01:18:12.523 --> 01:18:13.544]  Now they just act confident.
[01:18:13.704 --> 01:18:16.165]  Yeah, so they just sit up there and act all confident.
[01:18:16.185 --> 01:18:16.865]  It's a con game.
[01:18:17.165 --> 01:18:18.566]  And they have the media behind them.
[01:18:19.566 --> 01:18:25.710]  And you know, somebody told me once when I was, this was a long time ago, this was a history teacher of mine, very intelligent woman.
[01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:30.733]  She said, you know Owen, she said nothing is going to change until the status quo changes.
[01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:33.754]  And Donald Trump is the change in the status quo.
[01:18:33.854 --> 01:18:34.655]  He's the icebreaker.
[01:18:34.935 --> 01:18:40.037]  Whether you like what he says or what he's done, regardless of that, he's changed the status quo.
[01:18:40.077 --> 01:18:42.838]  He's changed what it means to be a quote-unquote politician.
[01:18:43.098 --> 01:18:44.479]  He's changed what a rally is.
[01:18:44.519 --> 01:18:46.620]  He's changed what a presidential candidate looks like.
[01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:50.101]  He's changed how these people talk in their speeches.
[01:18:50.181 --> 01:18:56.764]  So, this is the status quo changed to me and they can't pull the curtain back over the uh... disgusting demon.
[01:18:56.784 --> 01:19:00.386]  Well, their fear of him is everything I need to know and it's legitimate.
[01:19:00.926 --> 01:19:02.867]  Because he wants prosperity
[01:19:04.042 --> 01:19:06.905]  He hates these guys that suppress liberty.
[01:19:07.725 --> 01:19:08.846]  And that's why they hate him.
[01:19:09.126 --> 01:19:10.147]  They hate his spirit.
[01:19:10.167 --> 01:19:11.268]  And what does that tell me?
[01:19:11.288 --> 01:19:12.369]  That tells me he's got a good spirit.
[01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:15.432]  Now, I'm going to stop right there.
[01:19:15.672 --> 01:19:16.533]  I want to play this clip.
[01:19:16.553 --> 01:19:18.294]  We've got a bunch of other clips before Beggs comes in here.
[01:19:18.955 --> 01:19:19.916]  You're on fire, my friend.
[01:19:20.456 --> 01:19:30.225]  Every viewer out there has to know, whether you're old, whether you're young, whether you're from Africa, or whether you're from North America, whether you're from Europe, or Asia, or South America, whatever.
[01:19:30.405 --> 01:19:31.206]  Just Australia.
[01:19:31.914 --> 01:19:32.535]  Antarctica.
[01:19:33.175 --> 01:19:33.936]  You want freedom.
[01:19:33.956 --> 01:19:35.017]  You're not a screw people.
[01:19:35.317 --> 01:19:36.178]  You want prosperity.
[01:19:36.198 --> 01:19:37.019]  You like people.
[01:19:37.559 --> 01:19:38.460]  You like choices.
[01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:39.261]  You like diversity.
[01:19:39.281 --> 01:19:40.342]  You like everybody.
[01:19:40.882 --> 01:19:43.905]  You're tired of hearing all day how your race isn't bad.
[01:19:43.925 --> 01:19:45.327]  Because they know you got a soul.
[01:19:45.367 --> 01:19:47.048]  They want to make you feel guilty because you do care.
[01:19:47.068 --> 01:19:48.810]  You're like, what bad's going on?
[01:19:48.850 --> 01:19:49.491]  I better be nice.
[01:19:49.511 --> 01:19:51.072]  You need to be a warrior.
[01:19:51.172 --> 01:19:51.893]  You are a warrior.
[01:19:52.353 --> 01:19:54.055]  It's that warrior self you're finding now.
[01:19:55.757 --> 01:19:56.677]  Spread these videos.
[01:19:56.717 --> 01:19:57.497]  Spread these articles.
[01:19:57.577 --> 01:19:58.538]  Do your own articles.
[01:19:58.558 --> 01:19:59.198]  Do your own videos.
[01:19:59.238 --> 01:19:59.538]  Whatever.
[01:20:00.178 --> 01:20:00.898]  Get aggressive.
[01:20:00.978 --> 01:20:01.618]  Get in a fight.
[01:20:02.318 --> 01:20:03.419]  Spend 20 hours.
[01:20:03.839 --> 01:20:05.639]  Stay up two days in an info war.
[01:20:06.539 --> 01:20:14.321]  You'll find yourself in that where you turn yourself over to justice and the windows of perception all open up to you.
[01:20:15.681 --> 01:20:20.742]  Now, granted, you go to some of the places I've gone.
[01:20:20.783 --> 01:20:22.543]  It's not fun because I have to deal
[01:20:23.709 --> 01:20:24.030]  I don't
[01:20:39.591 --> 01:20:42.192]  driven forward to the very front lines of these people.
[01:20:42.872 --> 01:20:46.693]  And the biggest problem fighting them is how horrible and evil they are and how pathetic they are.
[01:20:46.753 --> 01:20:50.994]  It's very embarrassing to even be spiritually up against stuff like this.
[01:20:51.174 --> 01:20:53.054]  You feel dirty in proximity.
[01:20:53.094 --> 01:20:58.616]  You dominate it, you win against it, but you've still got to smell the spiritual evil, the smell of death.
[01:20:59.156 --> 01:21:00.116]  So I want to play this clip.
[01:21:00.136 --> 01:21:02.737]  I think it's a clip you put together of Hillary flipping out today.
[01:21:03.317 --> 01:21:08.900]  And then we've got a bunch of other clips and then Joe Biggs is going to come in here, but we haven't got into key indicators that Trump wins.
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:12.001]  I don't put these out to create some perception he's going to win.
[01:21:12.381 --> 01:21:14.883]  Polls, numbers, they've rigged everything.
[01:21:14.923 --> 01:21:16.503]  This guy is winning a landslide.
[01:21:16.964 --> 01:21:20.105]  And so the bigger discussion tomorrow on the Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:22.046]  will be, what happens if they steal it?
[01:21:22.126 --> 01:21:22.726]  What do we do?
[01:21:23.067 --> 01:21:23.807]  How do we respond?
[01:21:23.847 --> 01:21:24.767]  What are the angles on that?
[01:21:26.028 --> 01:21:27.169]  Oh, and set up a clip for us.
[01:21:27.749 --> 01:21:32.512]  Well, we're going to actually go to some clips from her speech later on in the broadcast tonight.
[01:21:32.532 --> 01:21:37.315]  But this is one, I was working on it, you came by and we were both kind of laughing like, oh, she looks like the Wicked Witch of the West.
[01:21:37.595 --> 01:21:40.797]  And then you had a trigger in your mind, literally right there, you were like.
[01:21:41.357 --> 01:21:44.898]  Oh my god, that actually reminds me of a scene from The Wizard of Oz.
[01:21:44.918 --> 01:21:46.618]  From an exact arm mess where she's like, go forth!
[01:21:46.918 --> 01:21:47.439]  Defeat them!
[01:21:47.459 --> 01:21:49.999]  And I'm like, that's what the Wicked Witch does in Wizard of Oz.
[01:21:50.159 --> 01:21:53.540]  So here's Hillary Clinton or the Wicked Witch of the West.
[01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:55.041]  You be the decision.
[01:21:55.341 --> 01:21:55.761]  Here it is.
[01:21:59.922 --> 01:22:05.123]  Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton is waging an all-out war on guns and gun owners.
[01:22:05.543 --> 01:22:07.304]  I want those most of all!
[01:22:07.344 --> 01:22:07.884]  Now die!
[01:22:09.312 --> 01:22:11.214]  I think so.
[01:22:37.841 --> 01:22:45.286]  God bless you!
[01:22:46.347 --> 01:22:50.950]  Now I've got Donald Trump's argument for America very powerful.
[01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:54.833]  Donald Trump, time to close the history books on the Clintons and the Bushes absolutely.
[01:22:54.853 --> 01:22:56.274]  Oh, and other points.
[01:22:57.182 --> 01:23:02.427]  Well, I think you mentioned this earlier, how the strongest Trump endorsement is his enemies.
[01:23:03.008 --> 01:23:08.113]  And the only reservation I have against Donald Trump right now is essentially he'd be the greatest PSYOP of all time.
[01:23:08.553 --> 01:23:09.955]  He'd be the greatest actor of all time.
[01:23:09.975 --> 01:23:10.315]  He's real.
[01:23:10.716 --> 01:23:11.256]  But I agree.
[01:23:11.356 --> 01:23:14.259]  And I think that it's the behavior of... My gut's never wrong.
[01:23:14.279 --> 01:23:14.820]  He's real.
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:16.461]  He may be deceived.
[01:23:17.322 --> 01:23:20.223]  Like King David or Solomon, but he's real, man.
[01:23:20.483 --> 01:23:22.804]  And it's the behavior of Obama... And he's anointed.
[01:23:23.184 --> 01:23:28.526]  It's the behavior of Obama and Clinton and all the other shills in the government that is exposing it.
[01:23:28.766 --> 01:23:29.707]  They're freaking out.
[01:23:30.147 --> 01:23:32.448]  I mean, they are genuinely... Because he's anointed.
[01:23:32.488 --> 01:23:33.128]  ...panicking.
[01:23:33.248 --> 01:23:34.428]  They're so panicked.
[01:23:34.588 --> 01:23:35.349]  Look at this, Alex.
[01:23:35.949 --> 01:23:36.269]  Look at this.
[01:23:36.529 --> 01:23:41.331]  They're going to sit here, and they're going to demonize Donald Trump for being a misogynist, a racist.
[01:23:41.711 --> 01:23:45.552]  Hillary Clinton's so desperate, she's going to get Jay-Z to perform for her a concert.
[01:23:45.572 --> 01:23:46.693]  Then she's going to brag about it.
[01:23:47.895 --> 01:23:51.616]  He goes on stage and curses, uses racial slurs.
[01:23:52.136 --> 01:23:54.117]  Jay-Z's lyrics objectify women.
[01:23:54.157 --> 01:23:55.217]  He writes about raping.
[01:23:55.237 --> 01:23:56.758]  That's okay though, Hillary does it.
[01:23:56.978 --> 01:24:00.379]  Trump at some edited thing 11 years ago said, women throw yourselves at me.
[01:24:00.579 --> 01:24:01.699]  You didn't even grab their pussy.
[01:24:01.739 --> 01:24:03.180]  He means they're throwing themselves at him.
[01:24:05.256 --> 01:24:06.997]  Bush admitted he goaded him to say that.
[01:24:07.337 --> 01:24:10.038]  Hours of talk on the bus waiting for the shoot.
[01:24:10.398 --> 01:24:13.319]  Getting him to say something dirty so they had it on tape against him.
[01:24:13.499 --> 01:24:16.840]  And I don't care about Jay- You want to listen to Jay-Z in your free time?
[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:22.421]  Exactly, but don't say Trump's the demon and Hillary's got campaign ads about what are the children seeing?
[01:24:22.441 --> 01:24:24.362]  I don't know, what do they see at those hot tubs, Hillary?
[01:24:24.422 --> 01:24:25.082]  I don't know, what do they see?
[01:24:25.242 --> 01:24:29.903]  The hypocrisy is so thick you could cut it with a knife.
[01:24:30.303 --> 01:24:31.183]  I mean, this is a joke.
[01:24:31.223 --> 01:24:31.864]  Again, I don't care.
[01:24:31.884 --> 01:24:32.664]  If you want to listen to Jay-Z,
[01:24:33.744 --> 01:24:34.405]  Exactly!
[01:24:34.425 --> 01:24:35.906]  We're not like super puritan here.
[01:24:36.306 --> 01:24:37.547]  Just don't be hypocrites.
[01:24:37.567 --> 01:24:38.768]  Now let's go ahead and go to this next clip.
[01:24:39.488 --> 01:24:41.910]  This is Donald Trump's argument for America.
[01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.771]  Very powerful.
[01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:43.231]  Here it is.
[01:24:45.573 --> 01:24:56.341]  Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American people.
[01:24:58.027 --> 01:25:02.792]  The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election.
[01:25:03.132 --> 01:25:13.443]  For those who control the levers of power in Washington and for the global special interest, they partner with these people that don't have your good in mind.
[01:25:14.404 --> 01:25:31.367]  The political establishment that is trying to stop us is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration, and economic and foreign policies that have bled our country dry.
[01:25:32.128 --> 01:25:44.471]  The political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs as they flee to Mexico, China, and other countries all around the world.
[01:25:44.931 --> 01:25:59.514]  It's a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth, and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations.
[01:26:00.274 --> 01:26:02.396]  And political entities.
[01:26:03.176 --> 01:26:08.420]  The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you.
[01:26:10.281 --> 01:26:15.104]  The only force strong enough to save our country is us.
[01:26:15.805 --> 01:26:22.129]  The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American people.
[01:26:22.450 --> 01:26:25.692]  I'm doing this for the people
[01:26:26.821 --> 01:26:33.253]  And for the movement, and we will take back this country for you, and we will make America great again.
[01:26:35.785 --> 01:26:36.925]  Real deal, folks.
[01:26:37.326 --> 01:26:37.906]  Not perfect.
[01:26:38.546 --> 01:26:39.326]  I'm Donald Trump.
[01:26:39.366 --> 01:26:40.947]  Enough of a maniac to stand up against them.
[01:26:41.387 --> 01:26:43.868]  By the way, we've got an hour and 25 minutes of live broadcast.
[01:26:43.888 --> 01:26:44.788]  I got a whole crew up here.
[01:26:44.808 --> 01:26:45.949]  I'm not bitching or complaining.
[01:26:46.329 --> 01:26:48.350]  I just realized we're not even worried about money here.
[01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:48.850]  We should be.
[01:26:49.570 --> 01:26:52.911]  I had my accountant come in on Monday and say, you're losing money the last quarter.
[01:26:52.991 --> 01:26:53.812]  You're not doing plugs.
[01:26:53.832 --> 01:26:54.732]  You're not doing sponsors.
[01:26:54.752 --> 01:26:55.793]  You're not cutting ads.
[01:26:56.273 --> 01:26:57.373]  Can we get you to do that?
[01:26:58.053 --> 01:26:59.554]  I'm like, well, we saved some money before.
[01:26:59.574 --> 01:27:00.714]  They're like, yeah, you're running out of that.
[01:27:00.734 --> 01:27:01.975]  Because I'm all in here.
[01:27:03.206 --> 01:27:09.811]  You need to go to InfowarsStore.com, get our new Bio PCA hair and nail and skin formula.
[01:27:10.632 --> 01:27:11.913]  I say this because it's true.
[01:27:11.933 --> 01:27:13.874]  I mean, they're our leading competitors.
[01:27:13.894 --> 01:27:17.537]  They sell at salons that have just one of the ingredients, the strength we have, for $50, $60.
[01:27:17.737 --> 01:27:18.898]  It's stronger than ours.
[01:27:18.958 --> 01:27:19.078]  It's $19.95!
[01:27:23.319 --> 01:27:28.045]  We're just not like the other people that just, you know, we've got like eight different ingredients in this.
[01:27:28.085 --> 01:27:33.512]  We're not gonna sit there when the ingredients cost ten bucks and then sell it to you for fifty.
[01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:35.861]  We're going to sell it for $19.95.
[01:27:35.941 --> 01:27:38.802]  Now, it's actually like $14 a product in this.
[01:27:39.262 --> 01:27:41.624]  We are discounting it out of the gates.
[01:27:41.644 --> 01:27:41.624]  $19.95.
[01:27:41.784 --> 01:27:45.746]  Very small profit, but it's not that profit's bad, but we deserve a bigger profit.
[01:27:45.826 --> 01:27:46.866]  Go buy 10 bottles of it.
[01:27:47.246 --> 01:27:48.427]  Go buy Super Metal Vitality.
[01:27:48.447 --> 01:27:48.967]  Go buy X2.
[01:27:49.307 --> 01:27:51.509]  Go take advantage of the Swirlable Food Special.
[01:27:51.549 --> 01:27:53.910]  It's still on InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:28:07.191 --> 01:28:08.191]  Knockout with Sleep Aid.

[01:28:11.593 --> 01:28:12.494]  Highest quality.
[01:28:13.614 --> 01:28:14.255]  Amazing.

[01:28:17.657 --> 01:28:18.377]  Secret 12.
[01:28:19.578 --> 01:28:20.478]  That is so important.
[01:28:20.638 --> 01:28:21.079]  Totally.
[01:28:21.279 --> 01:28:21.859]  Absolutely.
[01:28:21.959 --> 01:28:22.419]  Organic.
[01:28:22.519 --> 01:28:22.900]  Pure.

[01:28:26.121 --> 01:28:27.242]  The total game changer.

[01:28:34.994 --> 01:28:36.635]  Quite frankly, I get not supporting us.
[01:28:36.675 --> 01:28:37.935]  You're busy, you got stuff going on.
[01:28:37.995 --> 01:28:39.235]  Hey, Alex is always there fighting.
[01:28:39.696 --> 01:28:48.719]  We could do so much more if I would just have sponsors and mess with them and vet them and make sure they're good and then sit there and kiss their ass and talk to them on the phone and all this.
[01:28:49.119 --> 01:28:49.599]  I don't do that.
[01:28:49.619 --> 01:28:50.639]  I barely have any sponsors.
[01:28:51.039 --> 01:28:54.441]  I brought some sponsors back because they're good companies, but still dealing with them.
[01:28:54.521 --> 01:28:56.421]  I just, you know, I got stuff to do.
[01:28:56.461 --> 01:28:57.061]  You know what I mean?
[01:28:57.081 --> 01:28:58.282]  I haven't had sponsors in four years.
[01:28:58.302 --> 01:29:01.263]  I started bringing them back because we need funding and I'm just like, you know what?
[01:29:02.119 --> 01:29:04.500]  Look, I'm not going to sit there and play games.
[01:29:05.081 --> 01:29:06.081]  I need your support.
[01:29:06.101 --> 01:29:16.228]  I need you to go to InfoWarsStore.com so I can continue on, expand, fund our great reporters that deserve to be taken care of, how they're risking their lives and taking action.

[01:29:19.530 --> 01:29:21.631]  InfoWarsStore.com is the big umbrella site.

[01:29:25.751 --> 01:29:29.694]  Well, when you talk about indicators for what's going to happen with this election, I think that
[01:29:45.119 --> 01:29:48.380]  People prioritize what indicators mean more to them.
[01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:53.241]  For me, it's rally turnout and what I see on social media.
[01:29:53.261 --> 01:29:54.162]  Rally turnout's not as close.
[01:29:54.182 --> 01:29:55.902]  Social media, 20 times for Trump.
[01:29:56.262 --> 01:29:57.903]  Rallies, 50 times for Trump.
[01:29:58.423 --> 01:30:02.324]  Adding 20-30% more for Hillary in polls, but she's still the winner.
[01:30:02.924 --> 01:30:10.750]  I think that the craziest phenomenon that I'm seeing, though, is when Hillary Clinton goes on YouTube and goes live... Three people went to see Tim Kaine, though.
[01:30:11.470 --> 01:30:12.191]  Look at that line!
[01:30:12.211 --> 01:30:12.251]  Oh!
[01:30:12.651 --> 01:30:15.693]  Wait, wait, there might be a child in that stroller.
[01:30:15.733 --> 01:30:16.434]  It could be four.
[01:30:16.714 --> 01:30:18.075]  Might have been four at the Tim Kaine rally.
[01:30:18.095 --> 01:30:19.956]  Might have been a little, yeah, a little hors d'oeuvre.
[01:30:19.976 --> 01:30:21.998]  Oh my God.
[01:30:22.478 --> 01:30:22.798]  Jeez.
[01:30:23.259 --> 01:30:24.380]  It's sad, but it's true.
[01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:27.122]  But when Hillary Clinton goes live on YouTube,
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:30.923]  She gets probably an aggregate of 10,000 people to tune in.
[01:30:30.943 --> 01:30:39.230]  And that's what the database of, you know, millions of fake Twitter accounts, everything, the media, billions spent.
[01:30:39.911 --> 01:30:40.451]  But look at this.
[01:30:40.591 --> 01:30:46.456]  Every time, Alex, the dislikes are 60%, 70% of the clicks is dislikes.
[01:30:46.777 --> 01:30:48.178]  You don't find that anywhere.
[01:30:48.198 --> 01:30:50.440]  Shows the elite are trying to force feed us, Hillary.
[01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:57.341]  You can go on YouTube all day long and you won't find a video that gets more dislikes than likes.
[01:30:57.501 --> 01:30:59.062]  So what does that signify?
[01:30:59.082 --> 01:31:00.582]  We get like 97% likes.
[01:31:01.062 --> 01:31:02.382]  So what does that signify?
[01:31:02.763 --> 01:31:04.943]  It signifies that nobody likes this bitch!
[01:31:05.443 --> 01:31:06.023]  Excuse me!
[01:31:06.203 --> 01:31:07.243]  That's what it signifies!
[01:31:07.464 --> 01:31:10.424]  Donald Trump goes live, hundreds of thousands of people... You see them headlights?
[01:31:10.444 --> 01:31:11.764]  You see me knock them curtains down?
[01:31:11.844 --> 01:31:12.765]  Move, bitch!
[01:31:13.125 --> 01:31:14.165]  Get out the way!
[01:31:14.185 --> 01:31:15.325]  Move, bitch!
[01:31:15.605 --> 01:31:16.485]  Get out the way!
[01:31:16.906 --> 01:31:17.546]  But that's it!
[01:31:17.646 --> 01:31:18.886]  Nobody likes her, Alex!
[01:31:19.246 --> 01:31:19.988]  See them headlights?
[01:31:20.008 --> 01:31:20.891]  Nobody likes her!
[01:31:20.951 --> 01:31:22.034]  See me knock that curtain down?
[01:31:22.054 --> 01:31:23.779]  Who bought them TVs, bitch?
[01:31:23.839 --> 01:31:24.381]  Tell me that!
[01:31:24.421 --> 01:31:25.504]  You doing the speed limit?
[01:31:25.925 --> 01:31:26.928]  Get out of my way!
[01:31:28.393 --> 01:31:30.034]  I'm doing 100 on the highway!
[01:31:30.434 --> 01:31:30.755]  I don't know.
[01:31:30.855 --> 01:31:32.856]  I think that it's going to be, it'll be interesting.
[01:31:32.896 --> 01:31:34.837]  We know there's going to be outrage either way.
[01:31:34.957 --> 01:31:36.398]  If Trump wins, people will be riding.
[01:31:36.699 --> 01:31:40.421]  If Hillary wins, I mean, the Trump movement is not going to stop.
[01:31:40.881 --> 01:31:42.602]  There's so much momentum behind this.
[01:31:42.623 --> 01:31:45.164]  You think Hillary Clinton is going to stop the Trump movement?
[01:31:45.184 --> 01:31:46.685]  Trump is obviously the highway.
[01:31:47.186 --> 01:31:48.466]  Infowars is the highway.
[01:31:48.807 --> 01:31:58.033]  And we've got this weird creep with Weiner and Aberdeen, the sexual mutilator princess, and all these creepy pedophile groups and the police exposing him.
[01:31:58.633 --> 01:32:02.395]  And I get embarrassed when the leftist media froths to defend it.
[01:32:02.415 --> 01:32:09.178]  I mean, would they sit there in the room with Hillary, when they come in with a kid, and Hillary takes that hatchet and just takes it to that kid's head?
[01:32:09.198 --> 01:32:10.358]  You know what's incredible?
[01:32:10.578 --> 01:32:12.119]  She did that with hundreds of thousands in Syria.
[01:32:12.619 --> 01:32:13.680]  Funding the murder of Christians.
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:18.042]  I mean, would they be there when Hillary's got the livers just biting into her?
[01:32:18.202 --> 01:32:20.783]  Would they be like, oh, we worship you, goddess, we worship you.
[01:32:20.803 --> 01:32:22.824]  I mean, is that their death goddess, Kali?
[01:32:23.284 --> 01:32:24.845]  We came, we saw, he died.
[01:32:25.005 --> 01:32:25.945]  She celebrates it.
[01:32:26.105 --> 01:32:27.026]  She celebrates it.
[01:32:27.608 --> 01:32:32.209]  I mean, that's her own, that's her own... So I'll get it, Salon and others are Kali worshippers.
[01:32:33.009 --> 01:32:33.869]  But here's what's crazy.
[01:32:34.469 --> 01:32:37.990]  So we can sit here and we can deliberate on all... They worship the Death Goddess.
[01:32:38.050 --> 01:32:39.550]  On all the different projections, Alex.
[01:32:39.710 --> 01:32:48.392]  All the different potential scenarios that we have that could start to unravel or begin to cement themselves here in the next three, four days, five days, however long it takes to figure this out.
[01:32:48.632 --> 01:32:50.452]  Contested election, riots, whatever we get.
[01:32:51.272 --> 01:32:56.633]  Most people, I don't know, how many people do you think if you asked right now would say that they don't even think it matters?
[01:32:57.469 --> 01:32:58.830]  They don't even have... I get it.
[01:32:58.870 --> 01:33:00.731]  That's why I don't have some hope sometimes.
[01:33:01.352 --> 01:33:05.615]  There's just large swaths of people that think being weak and pathetic... I look at people, they're very soft looking.
[01:33:06.363 --> 01:33:08.044]  A lot of men look like they're not even alive.
[01:33:08.264 --> 01:33:10.025]  There's always some weird woman bossing them around.
[01:33:10.045 --> 01:33:16.029]  They're like, oh, don't talk about sports or politics or religion.
[01:33:16.370 --> 01:33:17.530]  Oh my god, you might offend me.
[01:33:18.271 --> 01:33:20.092]  This is out of my comfort zone.
[01:33:20.332 --> 01:33:21.553]  Put me back into my comfort zone.
[01:33:21.593 --> 01:33:23.835]  Talk about basketball or baseball or the Kardashians.
[01:33:23.855 --> 01:33:24.815]  I'm telling you, it's incredible.
[01:33:25.176 --> 01:33:26.156]  We've got other clips here.
[01:33:26.176 --> 01:33:26.897]  We've got another clip.
[01:33:26.937 --> 01:33:29.118]  I'm going to bring Beggs in here after you finish up.
[01:33:29.518 --> 01:33:30.319]  We're going to continue on.
[01:33:30.379 --> 01:33:31.860]  This is a two-hour transmission.
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:35.823]  Donald Trump trying to close the history books on the Clintons.
[01:33:35.843 --> 01:33:36.283]  Here it is.
[01:33:39.124 --> 01:33:44.967]  For the past 17 months, I've traveled across this nation and met the amazing people of our country.
[01:33:45.548 --> 01:33:49.490]  Their hopes have become my hopes, and their dreams have become my dreams.
[01:33:50.130 --> 01:33:52.631]  This is not just a campaign, it's a movement.
[01:33:53.131 --> 01:34:01.396]  It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance to take our government back from the donors and the special interests, and return the power to you, the American people.
[01:34:01.976 --> 01:34:05.658]  Fifteen days ago, I proposed my contract with the American voter.
[01:34:06.198 --> 01:34:10.261]  And a 100-day action plan to bring real change to Washington.
[01:34:10.761 --> 01:34:12.742]  We need change so badly.
[01:34:13.102 --> 01:34:19.887]  If we win on November 8th and elect a Republican House and Senate, we can finally deliver the change the American people deserve.
[01:34:20.407 --> 01:34:32.695]  My contract includes a plan to create 25 million new jobs, we will cut taxes on the middle class Americans by 35%, and we will repeal and replace the total disaster.
[01:34:34.816 --> 01:34:35.797]  It doesn't work.
[01:34:36.457 --> 01:34:41.620]  We will also immediately fix our terrible trade deals and stop the jobs from leaving our country.
[01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:47.203]  My contract includes a pledge to end illegal immigration and end it rapidly.
[01:34:47.644 --> 01:34:54.168]  Cancel federal funding for sanctuary cities and suspend the admission of Syrian refugees into our country.
[01:34:54.588 --> 01:34:59.090]  They're coming in by the thousands and Hillary Clinton wants to increase that by 600%.
[01:35:01.852 --> 01:35:06.535]  We will rebuild our badly depleted military and take care of our great, great veterans.
[01:35:06.955 --> 01:35:22.806]  We will give every parent in America the right to send their kids to the school of their choice, including millions of low-income African-American and Hispanic children who have been failed so long, for generations in fact, by the Democratic politicians like Hillary Clinton.
[01:35:23.286 --> 01:35:26.028]  They just haven't been able to do the job.
[01:35:26.509 --> 01:35:31.572]  They've treated African-Americans and Hispanics horribly in so many ways.
[01:35:32.172 --> 01:35:40.054]  We will undertake a national effort to reduce crime and poverty and bring jobs and safety to our inner cities, finally at last.
[01:35:40.474 --> 01:35:45.396]  We will restore the Constitution and nominate Supreme Court Justices who will do the same.
[01:35:45.996 --> 01:35:49.417]  At the center of my contract is my plan to end government corruption.
[01:35:49.937 --> 01:35:54.458]  Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States.
[01:35:55.038 --> 01:36:00.180]  And, if she were to win, it would create a constitutional crisis like no other.
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:09.607]  She is under multiple federal investigations, has committed many crimes, including perjury, and she is now facing the prospect of a federal indictment.
[01:36:10.148 --> 01:36:16.693]  It's time to close the history books on the Clintons and to open a bright new chapter focused on the great citizens of our country.
[01:36:17.454 --> 01:36:18.695]  I'm asking for your vote.
[01:36:19.275 --> 01:36:27.737]  And your help in electing a Republican majority in Congress so that we can finally change this broken system and make America great again.
[01:36:28.237 --> 01:36:31.418]  And when I say great, I mean great for everyone.
[01:36:31.738 --> 01:36:32.518]  Thank you very much.
[01:36:33.218 --> 01:36:39.360]  They took our greatness like a blood transfusion and gave it to globalists to dominate third world countries, not to even give them power.
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:42.781]  I'd be about to use our greatness to build them up, then we all rise.
[01:36:42.841 --> 01:36:44.221]  No, they're bringing us all down together.
[01:36:44.981 --> 01:36:47.362]  Owen, you're going to be here after I leave in 30 minutes.
[01:36:47.382 --> 01:36:50.863]  You and Biggs are going to continue on with the crew for another hour, three hours tonight.
[01:36:50.883 --> 01:36:58.706]  Another hour and a half left, but before we play this clip of Americanism versus Globalism, I'm going to bring Biggs in here with breaking news.
[01:36:58.726 --> 01:36:59.226]  Other points?
[01:36:59.966 --> 01:37:02.527]  Well, in the break, you were just talking about
[01:37:03.717 --> 01:37:06.738]  I mean, how stressful all this is, how emotional all this is.
[01:37:06.778 --> 01:37:07.858]  You know, you've got a family.
[01:37:07.998 --> 01:37:09.959]  You probably don't see them as much as you'd like to.
[01:37:09.979 --> 01:37:11.419]  Well, let's just be honest.
[01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:16.121]  It flips switches in me that are like, I want to, you know, take battle-axes out.
[01:37:16.241 --> 01:37:22.343]  I mean, I, you know, a lot of people, I mean, at this point, I'm just like, you know, I'm not going to deal with a bunch of pot-bellied pedophiles raping kids.
[01:37:22.403 --> 01:37:22.743]  I'm done.
[01:37:22.783 --> 01:37:23.003]  Okay.
[01:37:23.383 --> 01:37:24.504]  It's just, I'm done with you people.
[01:37:24.844 --> 01:37:27.064]  And then mainstream media saying pedophilia is good.
[01:37:27.104 --> 01:37:28.185]  I mean, you know, go to hell.
[01:37:28.985 --> 01:37:29.746]  Well, you know what, Alex?
[01:37:30.387 --> 01:37:40.359]  In my eyes and many other eyes out there, and it might not be the full truth, but to me it is, you started this fight with these people that's reached this point, that's reached where we're at right now.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.221]  And I'm gonna tell you something right now.
[01:37:43.183 --> 01:37:46.226]  Myself and other people my age are gonna finish it for you.
[01:37:47.005 --> 01:37:55.416]  We're not going to sit here and let our future, our country, our lineage be completely destroyed and murdered, quite frankly.
[01:37:55.716 --> 01:38:02.425]  Well, I don't, I mean, I think people like Barry Goldwater and others, the John Burr Society started it, but clearly in a digital age, I saw the threat.
[01:38:03.106 --> 01:38:03.426]  I don't know.
[01:38:24.970 --> 01:38:26.531]  She loves to hurt innocent people.
[01:38:26.571 --> 01:38:27.232]  I'm not perfect.
[01:38:27.492 --> 01:38:28.533]  Hell, I don't want to hurt kids.
[01:38:29.353 --> 01:38:31.555]  I'm ready to do anything.
[01:38:31.975 --> 01:38:32.615]  And they know that.
[01:38:32.635 --> 01:38:35.597]  And they can't stand the fact that we're not afraid.
[01:38:36.118 --> 01:38:39.180]  They are so afraid of the fact that I don't give a damn.
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:43.402]  My name, my treasure, my family, it's all on stopping them.
[01:38:43.883 --> 01:38:47.205]  Oh, and my kids don't have a future if she doesn't go down.
[01:38:48.311 --> 01:38:54.393]  I had an old friend of mine who was tweeting at me, obviously you know I was big into sports.
[01:38:54.873 --> 01:38:57.374]  And he was tweeting at me, he's like, why don't you tweet about sports more?
[01:38:57.394 --> 01:38:58.755]  Why aren't you into baseball?
[01:38:59.275 --> 01:39:00.775]  He's like, you used to love baseball so much.
[01:39:01.036 --> 01:39:01.796]  And I said, you know...
[01:39:03.174 --> 01:39:10.115]  If I want my kid to be able to enjoy baseball like I did as a kid, I need to do something right now.
[01:39:10.615 --> 01:39:13.256]  Because there's not going to be baseball in ten years.
[01:39:13.656 --> 01:39:14.936]  There's not even going to be a country.
[01:39:14.976 --> 01:39:20.037]  You'll be lucky if there's enough organization that you can go to the store and get a loaf of bread.
[01:39:20.057 --> 01:39:20.797]  Okay?
[01:39:21.297 --> 01:39:23.477]  That's the crisis level we've reached.
[01:39:23.838 --> 01:39:28.058]  Look at what's happening in Europe with the policies that Hillary Clinton wants to bring here.
[01:39:28.578 --> 01:39:29.959]  This is real stuff.
[01:39:30.199 --> 01:39:30.819]  This isn't illusionary.
[01:39:30.839 --> 01:39:32.079]  They're attacking civilization.
[01:39:32.719 --> 01:39:33.539]  These are demons.
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:34.740]  These are not illusions.
[01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:38.782]  These are realities that are manifesting themselves on this planet, people.
[01:39:39.082 --> 01:39:40.523]  They want to bring it to this country.
[01:39:40.543 --> 01:39:45.366]  They have to bring down sovereignty so they can engulf the world into a one-world government.
[01:39:46.046 --> 01:39:46.666]  Period.
[01:39:47.087 --> 01:39:48.027]  And I don't want that!
[01:39:48.767 --> 01:39:49.508]  Great job, brother.
[01:39:49.548 --> 01:39:51.109]  We're so glad to have you and the rest of the crew here.
[01:39:51.129 --> 01:39:53.670]  I want to thank the crew, Daria and Matt, being here late.
[01:39:53.690 --> 01:39:55.011]  We're going to have seven days a week.
[01:39:55.031 --> 01:39:57.892]  We're going to go 52 hours live, 11 a.m.
[01:39:57.952 --> 01:39:59.613]  Monday right through Wednesday.
[01:40:01.676 --> 01:40:08.800]  I'm just struggling with not so much guilt, my spirit is just wanting to fight and wanting to like find the angles to wake people up.
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:10.061]  But look, you're the answer.
[01:40:10.541 --> 01:40:11.581]  You can pray to God.
[01:40:12.002 --> 01:40:13.162]  You can call into radio.
[01:40:13.242 --> 01:40:14.423]  You can send video links.
[01:40:14.483 --> 01:40:15.443]  You can take action.
[01:40:15.924 --> 01:40:18.745]  You can find the stuff in WikiLeaks and send it to everybody.
[01:40:19.085 --> 01:40:21.867]  You're the human intelligence, the human we need.
[01:40:21.887 --> 01:40:25.489]  I don't care what color you are or where you came from, I want you to succeed.
[01:40:25.529 --> 01:40:27.570]  You got red blood, God made you, I love you.
[01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:29.211]  The globalists hate you.
[01:40:30.256 --> 01:40:31.276]  And they want to make you poor.
[01:40:31.316 --> 01:40:32.177]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:40:32.197 --> 01:40:35.858]  So they want to keep you hopeless and poor and everything else.
[01:40:35.938 --> 01:40:37.399]  I mean, these are nasty people.
[01:40:37.879 --> 01:40:39.720]  Together, we're going to overcome this.
[01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:40.780]  This is the great challenge.
[01:40:42.561 --> 01:40:43.681]  What's this next clip we got?
[01:40:43.701 --> 01:40:44.902]  This is, uh, what's the next clip?
[01:40:45.002 --> 01:40:45.562]  We're going to break.
[01:40:48.286 --> 01:40:50.647]  Americanism, not globalism, and I'm bringing Joe Biggs in.
[01:40:50.667 --> 01:41:03.532]  And then if the crew wants to go an hour after I'm gone, or five hours, they're welcome to, but I'll be back to Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., but this is an epic time to be alive, and again, all I can pledge to you on my soul is I'm not out to get you.
[01:41:04.012 --> 01:41:08.754]  I want you to live long, and I'll quote Spock, live long, whatever, prosper.
[01:41:09.234 --> 01:41:10.515]  I just want decency.
[01:41:11.095 --> 01:41:12.257]  That's right, I can't even do it with my hands.
[01:41:12.837 --> 01:41:14.059]  Usually can't, I'm so angry tonight.
[01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:16.342]  All I want is to have somebody say, no I'm not.
[01:41:16.382 --> 01:41:20.528]  The point is, I'm just saying, we need to wake up, we need to take action.
[01:41:20.548 --> 01:41:21.509]  The globalists are evil.
[01:41:22.546 --> 01:41:24.987]  And now is the time to realize it and overthrow them.
[01:41:25.728 --> 01:41:30.670]  Anybody tries to guilt you and say you're a piece of crap when you're not, they're wanting to control you.
[01:41:31.271 --> 01:41:32.611]  Good people have a conscience.
[01:41:32.791 --> 01:41:34.032]  Evil people manipulate us.
[01:41:34.752 --> 01:41:37.654]  Our conscience should be if we don't overrun them.
[01:41:37.954 --> 01:41:38.534]  Here's the clip.
[01:41:38.895 --> 01:41:40.475]  We're going to bring in Joe Biggs with the breaking news.
[01:41:40.495 --> 01:41:40.896]  Stay with us.
[01:41:43.817 --> 01:41:47.999]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[01:41:51.761 --> 01:41:56.145]  Americanism, not globalism!
[01:41:56.165 --> 01:42:00.228]  The era of economic surrender will finally be over.
[01:42:00.528 --> 01:42:06.632]  We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
[01:42:06.992 --> 01:42:14.538]  They have gotten the political establishment and the media establishment to become pure, wanton henchmen of totalitarianism.
[01:42:14.878 --> 01:42:19.682]  If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better.
[01:42:20.162 --> 01:42:23.325]  I think what the Chinese have done is really smart.
[01:42:35.635 --> 01:42:37.657]  Right here in Detroit.
[01:42:37.917 --> 01:42:43.541]  It's all training us to accept less, lowering expectations, a post-industrial world, a new dark age.
[01:42:43.722 --> 01:42:47.505]  That's what the UN Biological Diversity Assessment 1996 calls for.
[01:42:47.805 --> 01:42:56.071]  When we abandoned the policy of America first, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own.
[01:42:56.472 --> 01:43:00.575]  Not a world, Winston, that gets more beautiful and more technological and stronger.
[01:43:00.855 --> 01:43:03.117]  A world that gets uglier and stupider and more
[01:43:03.758 --> 01:43:10.504]  The government should allow Hillary Clinton to become President of the United States.
[01:43:10.984 --> 01:43:12.686]  I voted for Hillary Clinton.
[01:43:13.006 --> 01:43:14.047]  Well, I voted for Hillary.
[01:43:14.067 --> 01:43:16.349]  I guess I have to since I'm working for her as well.
[01:43:16.650 --> 01:43:18.572]  You want an image of the future, Winston?
[01:43:18.772 --> 01:43:20.954]  It's a boot stomping on a human face forever.
[01:43:21.014 --> 01:43:27.400]  Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.
[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:32.142]  Women are treated discriminated against in all these countries she took money against.
[01:43:32.462 --> 01:43:35.964]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely.
[01:43:36.004 --> 01:43:37.505]  They're mistreated.
[01:43:37.545 --> 01:43:38.946]  She claims to be their champion.
[01:43:39.306 --> 01:43:47.910]  Don't look at me, Weston, and see the black circles around my eyes, and see how ugly and weak I am, expressing myself and dying, and I torture people 18 hours a day, and I have a horrible life.
[01:43:48.150 --> 01:43:52.472]  That's the beauty of the satanic evil of the priest of power, ripping apart humanity.
[01:43:52.632 --> 01:43:53.773]  We're here to hurt humans.
[01:43:53.933 --> 01:43:55.354]  We're here to suck your guts out!
[01:43:56.590 --> 01:44:02.635]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:44:04.416 --> 01:44:08.279]  Like a spider, biting its prey and then putting it into a trance.
[01:44:09.099 --> 01:44:14.423]  Tying you in a web, hanging you up so that you rot before they suck the blood and the life force out of you.
[01:44:15.364 --> 01:44:19.207]  I am attempting to get humanity to rise out of its trance.
[01:44:21.429 --> 01:44:24.111]  I have ideas, I have visions, I have
[01:44:25.973 --> 01:44:34.442]  Things that I wish for, for our species, for the love of our ancestors, the love of ourselves, the love of those that come in the future.
[01:44:35.103 --> 01:44:37.886]  The space-time continuum laying out before us.
[01:44:40.017 --> 01:44:41.318]  And I look at the globalists.
[01:44:41.338 --> 01:44:43.259]  They are committed to evil.
[01:44:44.019 --> 01:44:46.600]  They are committed to controlling us in the now.
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:48.281]  And that is Satanism.
[01:44:48.861 --> 01:44:50.522]  Now, they're going to continue broadcasting.
[01:44:50.542 --> 01:44:51.042]  They want to.
[01:44:51.162 --> 01:44:52.843]  Infowars.com, Ford's last show.
[01:44:53.603 --> 01:44:54.344]  Be an activist.
[01:44:54.444 --> 01:44:55.784]  Send this link out to everybody.
[01:44:56.205 --> 01:44:56.905]  You've done it before.
[01:44:56.945 --> 01:44:58.546]  We've had 3 million viewers in a night.
[01:44:59.026 --> 01:45:00.987]  Separate from the regular big radio show.
[01:45:01.653 --> 01:45:02.473]  Which is new people.
[01:45:03.034 --> 01:45:04.874]  It's an activism against globalism.
[01:45:05.214 --> 01:45:07.335]  It's an activism against being a slave.
[01:45:07.375 --> 01:45:23.541]  It's an activism of going against the AI and the pre-programmed algorithms and telling Facebook, telling YouTube, telling Google, telling all these platforms, Yahoo, that hey, InfoWars.com is live right now with a special live broadcast.
[01:45:23.581 --> 01:45:24.602]  I'm gonna leave in like 10 minutes.
[01:45:25.242 --> 01:45:32.565]  But Joe Biggs and Owen Schroer and Rob Dew and Daria and Matt, anybody that wants to come on, Matt, Daria, they all have great points as well.
[01:45:32.605 --> 01:45:35.506]  Just say that and patronize them, they really have great points.
[01:45:36.406 --> 01:45:36.906]  It's happening.
[01:45:37.586 --> 01:45:39.087]  And we want the government to stand up?
[01:45:39.587 --> 01:45:40.327]  Where's the government?
[01:45:40.467 --> 01:45:41.228]  Where's the FBI?
[01:45:41.268 --> 01:45:41.968]  Where's the military?
[01:45:42.008 --> 01:45:42.448]  They are!
[01:45:42.468 --> 01:45:46.410]  Okay, here they are, a bunch of pedophiles, a bunch of devil worshippers, America!
[01:45:46.690 --> 01:45:47.350]  Do something!
[01:45:48.626 --> 01:45:50.208]  Stop blaming the government all day!
[01:45:50.648 --> 01:45:58.536]  TSA, it's told we're under terror attack, they go grope you at the airport, point out our borders are open, point out our government brings in ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[01:45:59.837 --> 01:46:04.722]  Blaming the TSA agent, and I've done this myself, I've gotten more sophisticated over the years, isn't the way to go.
[01:46:05.462 --> 01:46:07.925]  Blame the Congress and why they did that.
[01:46:08.165 --> 01:46:08.826]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:46:09.773 --> 01:46:12.176]  The government, they want to have a civil war in this country.
[01:46:12.216 --> 01:46:12.837]  Soros does.
[01:46:12.917 --> 01:46:14.119]  I'm not some government worshipper.
[01:46:14.499 --> 01:46:16.662]  But the average person in government's not our enemy.
[01:46:17.142 --> 01:46:23.691]  They, quite frankly, on average, because they're so close to it, are exposing it more than the general public.
[01:46:24.710 --> 01:46:26.131]  That's why Soros wants a civil war.
[01:46:26.391 --> 01:46:28.091]  There is a civil war going on there right now.
[01:46:28.351 --> 01:46:28.732]  That's right.
[01:46:28.812 --> 01:46:31.793]  I went out last night with my Hillary for Prison shirt on.
[01:46:31.813 --> 01:46:34.794]  I actually happened to run into Owen and some other people.
[01:46:35.274 --> 01:46:37.115]  But I was attacked all night.
[01:46:37.735 --> 01:46:41.417]  Literally, people running over crazed, yelling at me, pulling out their phone.
[01:46:41.437 --> 01:46:42.477]  He must be a Trump supporter.
[01:46:42.697 --> 01:46:43.538]  You're a Trump supporter.
[01:46:43.758 --> 01:46:44.618]  Why are you wearing that shirt?
[01:46:44.638 --> 01:46:45.559]  You don't like Hillary Clinton.
[01:46:45.779 --> 01:46:47.000]  You must hate America.
[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:49.442]  You know, and that's all I would get the entire time.
[01:46:49.482 --> 01:46:50.202]  People hammer me.
[01:46:50.503 --> 01:46:54.325]  I had, like, this Amazon lady running up and screaming in my face, spitting.
[01:46:54.466 --> 01:46:55.186]  Hope we have video.
[01:46:55.226 --> 01:46:55.947]  This is epic.
[01:46:56.427 --> 01:46:58.949]  Now, I'm not going to be out there filming at a bar when I'm doing that.
[01:46:58.989 --> 01:47:06.174]  People are such arrogant dumbasses for their Saudi Arabian communist Chinese funded pedophile Satan woman.
[01:47:06.374 --> 01:47:11.376]  I literally had two of my friends leave because they're not used to that kind of confrontation.
[01:47:11.416 --> 01:47:12.817]  They're not used to being around me in public.
[01:47:12.837 --> 01:47:14.978]  So it's so epic, you're wearing a Hello from Prison shirt.
[01:47:14.998 --> 01:47:17.299]  Instead of getting the drink spot for you, this went pretty bad last night.
[01:47:17.319 --> 01:47:18.559]  Oh, it was intense.
[01:47:18.599 --> 01:47:24.702]  I mean, it was at a point where we literally had to leave, just be dragged out of there, in a sense, because everyone was running up.
[01:47:24.762 --> 01:47:29.324]  I had people looking at me and taking pictures and pulling up their phones and then going over and snickering.
[01:47:29.684 --> 01:47:33.045]  He's like, oh yeah, Donald Trump says criminals are coming across the board.
[01:47:33.085 --> 01:47:34.486]  I go, well actually they are.
[01:47:35.386 --> 01:47:36.426]  You're an effing racist.
[01:47:36.466 --> 01:47:44.849]  You've said it and just go and scream and yell and yell and I'm like a Minute, you know, I sat there for a minute and I I gave my composure I took a deep breath and I was like, you know what?
[01:47:45.289 --> 01:47:52.191]  I'm gonna be bigger than this I'm gonna walk over and explain to him why I am voting for Donald Trump and I Guarantee you out of a large group.
[01:47:52.371 --> 01:47:58.112]  I got three or four of them on on the Trump train They were kind of like, you know, they're all they've never been involved.
[01:47:58.152 --> 01:47:59.332]  They're slaves of the system.
[01:47:59.672 --> 01:48:01.433]  They want to just feel good You actually talked to him
[01:48:01.733 --> 01:48:03.514]  Oh, I sat down and actually spoke.
[01:48:03.554 --> 01:48:05.796]  I said, why does Donald Trump hate America?
[01:48:06.416 --> 01:48:08.117]  I said, give me one instance why.
[01:48:08.137 --> 01:48:13.461]  I was like, let me tell you the Donald Trump I see, the Donald Trump I know, that I've gotten to know over the last year.
[01:48:13.481 --> 01:48:15.682]  I was like, this is someone who loves America.
[01:48:16.002 --> 01:48:24.848]  This is someone who was willing to leave that billionaire lifestyle, give everything away, give it up, give it all to his kids, because he saw something wrong with America.
[01:48:25.128 --> 01:48:26.909]  He's seen it progress over the years.
[01:48:27.309 --> 01:48:28.770]  He got on the field.
[01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:29.911]  He got in the arena.
[01:48:30.051 --> 01:48:34.595]  Yeah, he was no longer a bystander, someone at a baseball game watching.
[01:48:34.655 --> 01:48:36.496]  He went down there and decided to make a change.
[01:48:36.857 --> 01:48:39.399]  He went out there and he actually did something.
[01:48:39.419 --> 01:48:43.763]  He's the one taking all the hits, all the media's attacking him every day.
[01:48:43.803 --> 01:48:45.444]  Could you imagine being Donald Trump?
[01:48:45.964 --> 01:48:48.426]  To take those amount of attacks every day.
[01:48:48.446 --> 01:48:51.869]  But the point is though, the hysteria has reached a fever pitch.
[01:48:52.570 --> 01:48:53.271]  It's ridiculous.
[01:48:54.071 --> 01:49:00.156]  And I can't go out without being known as the Trump guy and people yelling and snickering, which I don't mind.
[01:49:00.216 --> 01:49:06.361]  I wear it as a badge of honor because at the end of the day... So wait, even without your shirt, you're not a... Oh yeah, anywhere I go.
[01:49:06.601 --> 01:49:07.121]  Anywhere I go.
[01:49:07.161 --> 01:49:07.922]  Oh no, no, listen.
[01:49:08.062 --> 01:49:10.303]  I was at Martin Springs today after I did an 8-mile hike.
[01:49:11.224 --> 01:49:12.405]  I don't get it.
[01:49:12.525 --> 01:49:13.285]  I mean, how could you sit here
[01:49:31.317 --> 01:49:35.000]  And tell me why I shouldn't vote for someone who wants to save the Constitution.
[01:49:35.020 --> 01:49:38.622]  When Hillary is openly run by the Saudi Arabians and the Communist Chinese.
[01:49:39.403 --> 01:49:43.485]  I thought this was a joke at first, and I had to look at this Twitter account and go back months.
[01:49:44.246 --> 01:49:46.047]  It's over, you know, a year or so old.
[01:49:46.388 --> 01:49:49.930]  But it's the Marina Abramovich chick, the lady who does the spirit count.
[01:49:49.950 --> 01:49:50.670]  Hillary's high priest, yeah.
[01:49:50.771 --> 01:49:54.813]  Yeah, her Twitter handle, let me read you the tweet though, this came out yesterday.
[01:49:55.214 --> 01:49:58.636]  It goes, I'm not Satanist, stop it, at Abramomovich666.
[01:50:01.181 --> 01:50:02.726]  Actually, her Twitter handle!
[01:50:03.087 --> 01:50:04.571]  And she screams, I'm not a saint!
[01:50:04.631 --> 01:50:06.738]  I'm not a Nazi at Hitler.com!
[01:50:09.369 --> 01:50:11.390]  I saw that and I fell out of my chair laughing.
[01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:13.150]  I was like, this is just too intense.
[01:50:13.210 --> 01:50:14.370]  And I was like, this can't be real.
[01:50:14.650 --> 01:50:16.311]  Like, this must have just been started yesterday.
[01:50:16.331 --> 01:50:17.451]  And it goes back like a year.
[01:50:17.471 --> 01:50:18.571]  Like, you can scroll down.
[01:50:18.591 --> 01:50:19.671]  Please stop tweeting me.
[01:50:19.832 --> 01:50:21.312]  I'm not a Satanist at 666.
[01:50:22.292 --> 01:50:26.073]  You know, a lot of the emails, too, that came out today from... Dude, that's the greatest bumper sticker ever.
[01:50:27.053 --> 01:50:28.274]  I'm not a Satanist at 666.
[01:50:30.214 --> 01:50:33.655]  I saw that and I was like... I'm like bathing in blood and worshiping the devil.
[01:50:34.335 --> 01:50:35.236]  But think about some of this.
[01:50:35.276 --> 01:50:44.283]  I mean, I know you guys mentioned it earlier, but this is what I came, I wanted to talk about today, is the fact that in one of the new WikiLeaks emails, it talks about... Where is it at?
[01:50:44.303 --> 01:50:46.605]  There'll be children in the hot tub for your pleasure?
[01:50:46.625 --> 01:50:49.268]  I've got so many of these emails.
[01:50:49.408 --> 01:50:50.208]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:50:50.228 --> 01:50:54.112]  These beanie babies misbehaved, but we've got major fuzz on our back.
[01:50:54.152 --> 01:50:55.173]  We've got to get them on the street.
[01:50:56.133 --> 01:50:57.194]  $20,000 apiece for beanies?
[01:50:58.395 --> 01:51:00.037]  But how good are the walnut sauces?
[01:51:01.698 --> 01:51:02.239]  Oh my God.
[01:51:02.992 --> 01:51:04.194]  Have you seen those emails?
[01:51:06.097 --> 01:51:09.222]  Dude, who comes up with... We just want to go drink beer.
[01:51:11.646 --> 01:51:13.950]  Do you want dominoes on your pizza or your hot dog?
[01:51:13.970 --> 01:51:14.450]  What does that mean?
[01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:15.953]  That's not even a normal conversation.
[01:51:16.193 --> 01:51:17.094]  Yeah, that's code talk.
[01:51:18.075 --> 01:51:19.916]  Obama's bringing in $65,000 in hot dogs.
[01:51:20.436 --> 01:51:22.157]  Oh yeah, so this is the one today.
[01:51:22.197 --> 01:51:25.379]  I know I ran in and I was like, yeah, I got a golden nugget, dude.
[01:51:25.879 --> 01:51:27.260]  And he goes, oh, we already talked about it.
[01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:29.201]  So I had this one set aside for today.
[01:51:29.261 --> 01:51:31.822]  But if anybody's just tuning in, you know, here you go.
[01:51:32.163 --> 01:51:35.324]  So this is Tony Badesa to Horei Mashiiko.
[01:51:35.665 --> 01:51:36.725]  Sounds like a Japanese name.
[01:51:36.765 --> 01:51:40.127]  Says, I've stayed in touch with Danny Haysert for all these years.
[01:51:40.367 --> 01:51:42.008]  Danny Haysert, the convicted pedophile.
[01:51:42.148 --> 01:51:46.170]  So yeah, if you look at it, it's like Dennis Hastert sentenced to 15 months and apologizes for sex abuse.
[01:51:46.691 --> 01:51:58.058]  Sex abuse, once among the nation's most powerful politicians, was sentenced to 15 months in prison for illegally structuring bank transactions in an effort to cover up his sexual abuse of young members of a wrestling team he coached decades ago.
[01:51:58.598 --> 01:52:04.301]  I mean, so these are the kind of people that you have hanging around the Clintons, around the Podestas, that they stay in contact.
[01:52:04.542 --> 01:52:14.367]  Then you have Tony Podesta, his brother, who actually has this sexual art of teenagers hung across his house.
[01:52:15.068 --> 01:52:18.970]  And then there's a picture in a Washington Post article that was taken now, and I can't find it right now.
[01:52:19.050 --> 01:52:20.371]  It's probably on my Twitter somewhere.
[01:52:20.391 --> 01:52:21.031]  I got it right here.
[01:52:22.492 --> 01:52:25.453]  If you look at the body that's hanging, it's like a male body.
[01:52:25.673 --> 01:52:27.133]  It's a golden body of a naked boy.
[01:52:27.153 --> 01:52:31.894]  Yeah, it looks just like the way that, uh, what's the guy, the serial killer that killed the guys?
[01:52:32.614 --> 01:52:33.234]  Dahmer.
[01:52:33.274 --> 01:52:33.774]  Yeah, Dahmer.
[01:52:34.034 --> 01:52:38.055]  Jeffrey Dahmer used to post his bodies in that position after he killed them.
[01:52:38.195 --> 01:52:39.635]  Why are you a Dahmer-phobe?
[01:52:41.436 --> 01:52:48.337]  You know, I'm a research phobe and after studying all this stuff for the past few days, you know what, I haven't lost sleep
[01:52:49.643 --> 01:52:51.184]  Uh, you know, in the last few years.
[01:52:51.204 --> 01:52:53.626]  You didn't tear a door off the wall and stuff like that?
[01:52:54.326 --> 01:52:55.167]  Oh, I was pretty angry.
[01:52:55.187 --> 01:52:57.108]  I'm not even bragging about it.
[01:52:57.148 --> 01:52:57.989]  I didn't want to do that.
[01:52:58.049 --> 01:53:01.411]  I just have to, like, I'm like, I want to be honest.
[01:53:01.471 --> 01:53:03.012]  I mean, like, these people think they intimidate us.
[01:53:03.032 --> 01:53:03.492]  They don't.
[01:53:03.512 --> 01:53:10.497]  We're like, they're pushing us to levels where switches are being flipped and I'm like, thinking, I'm just like, you know, I just want to attack kids.
[01:53:10.557 --> 01:53:11.858]  I mean, I'm just, you know.
[01:53:11.918 --> 01:53:14.239]  I slipped into a dark place yesterday.
[01:53:14.279 --> 01:53:15.981]  A dark place I haven't been since combat.
[01:53:16.863 --> 01:53:17.544]  I don't know.
[01:53:34.386 --> 01:53:37.868]  You know, it's confusing, you know, as someone who I believe like I'm a good-hearted person.
[01:53:37.928 --> 01:53:39.289]  Who the hell wants to hurt kids?
[01:53:39.729 --> 01:53:44.192]  Yeah, I mean, how can you have this information also be brought to the forefront?
[01:53:44.512 --> 01:53:47.094]  And how could you be a Clinton supporter?
[01:53:47.114 --> 01:53:57.020]  Listen, when I see Mother Jones and Salon make jokes about this, when they have articles like Salon promoting pedophilia, I'm like, oh my God, you're really that evil.
[01:53:57.220 --> 01:54:01.223]  It freaks me out that they like, they love it!
[01:54:01.903 --> 01:54:02.984]  They brought the guy on.
[01:54:03.164 --> 01:54:06.627]  Remember, there was this creepy dude who's got a little webcam headset on and all that.
[01:54:07.047 --> 01:54:14.434]  And he goes, you know, I saw this girl and she was maybe five or six and she was spiraling, you know, twirling around in flowers.
[01:54:14.514 --> 01:54:16.776]  And, you know, I just imagine, yeah, that's it right there.
[01:54:17.236 --> 01:54:18.457]  You know, and he's given his whole story.
[01:54:18.477 --> 01:54:19.778]  And he's having this vision.
[01:54:19.818 --> 01:54:20.459]  I'm having visions.
[01:54:20.479 --> 01:54:22.280]  But he's like, he's like, I'm not a bad person.
[01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:23.901]  He's like, I've never touched one before.
[01:54:24.322 --> 01:54:25.843]  He's like, but I think about it all the time.
[01:54:25.883 --> 01:54:26.884]  Well, that's not normal.
[01:54:27.264 --> 01:54:28.745]  They're pushing it on us.
[01:54:29.045 --> 01:54:33.549]  It's like the, the, the pedestrians in the Washington Post going, yeah, we got photos of naked kids.
[01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:34.350]  What you going to do about it?
[01:54:35.097 --> 01:54:36.418]  Well, it's art, though.
[01:54:36.478 --> 01:54:37.358]  You know, it's art.
[01:54:37.438 --> 01:54:38.919]  Once you say something's art, it's okay.
[01:54:39.319 --> 01:54:56.689]  You know, if you have pictures of... I've got some big information that might be coming out soon that I can't really talk too much about until I get, you know, confirmed what it is, but I've got some sources who've been sending me information of the really inner workings of this pedophile ring.
[01:54:56.709 --> 01:54:57.870]  Well, I mean, I've discovered what it is.
[01:54:57.890 --> 01:55:01.292]  Let me... I don't know if... You didn't give me this info, so I don't know if this is it, but I'm going out on a limb here.
[01:55:02.253 --> 01:55:04.115]  Eric Prince of Blackwater, who they've demonized.
[01:55:04.195 --> 01:55:07.037]  Every other bad op of mercenaries they would blame on Blackwater.
[01:55:07.077 --> 01:55:10.500]  I now know that one of the things I was wrong about 10 years ago was always blaming them for everything.
[01:55:11.061 --> 01:55:15.024]  Stuff wasn't perfect, the wars were wrong, so it was bad, but Eric Prince ran a clean operation overall.
[01:55:15.284 --> 01:55:15.945]  He got blamed for everything.
[01:55:16.325 --> 01:55:21.449]  Prince is in Breitbart and other places saying, I have federal sources, Lolita Express, pedophile rings, it's all happening.
[01:55:22.670 --> 01:55:41.445]  And I separately know that they're aware of all of this going on, and have been basically exposing it, and that they've been funding covert groups to go in, in Africa, Latin America, you name it, and actually free people in sex slavery.
[01:55:41.826 --> 01:55:47.790]  Now, I knew that from other special forces people they've been hiring, I'm not going to say Blackwater, I'm going to say a group, to actually stop this show.
[01:55:50.012 --> 01:55:56.557]  Credit, the word is, and I have it from multiple sources that don't know each other, he's running a worldwide program to stop it.
[01:55:57.037 --> 01:55:58.659]  So now he's surfaced to expose it.
[01:55:58.699 --> 01:55:59.619]  Now that's pretty heroic.
[01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:01.461]  Now, is that one of your sources?
[01:56:03.742 --> 01:56:06.584]  This is the actual, the bad stuff.
[01:56:06.625 --> 01:56:10.708]  This is the stuff that if I get it, I'm going to have to call the FBI myself.
[01:56:11.698 --> 01:56:13.019]  It's, it's pretty bad stuff.
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:15.181]  It's, it's pretty horrible.
[01:56:15.201 --> 01:56:17.503]  I was sick of my stomach quite a bit earlier today.
[01:56:18.143 --> 01:56:21.866]  And, uh, the descriptions and what they're finding, I told them to hold off.
[01:56:22.607 --> 01:56:24.808]  Uh, but... No, but is it to do with Blackwater?
[01:56:24.828 --> 01:56:26.550]  Because we know Blackwater... No, no, no.
[01:56:26.610 --> 01:56:29.152]  No, this is Podesta-type stuff.
[01:56:29.352 --> 01:56:34.276]  Them, uh, photo collections that they have... Well, no, they're already sharing a little with cops.
[01:56:34.316 --> 01:56:36.958]  What they're doing with children and all that, it's pretty screwed up.
[01:56:37.398 --> 01:56:38.599]  So you're getting this from law enforcement?
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:40.301]  I'm getting this from a source, yes.
[01:56:40.781 --> 01:56:42.383]  Well, what do you make of what I said about Blackwater?
[01:56:42.863 --> 01:56:44.345]  I would not doubt that.
[01:56:44.385 --> 01:56:51.471]  I actually have a buddy who goes into places like Iraq and they go and rescue women and children who have been involved in human trafficking.
[01:56:51.491 --> 01:56:53.133]  Well, sure, I forgot about three months ago.
[01:56:53.153 --> 01:56:54.975]  Yeah, I was going to go, but then we had the army.
[01:56:55.015 --> 01:56:57.117]  What do you make of all these other guys, like operators?
[01:56:57.157 --> 01:56:57.977]  Oh, I wouldn't doubt it.
[01:56:57.998 --> 01:56:59.659]  I mean, the point is they're doing this whole deal.
[01:56:59.679 --> 01:56:59.999]  Oh, of course.
[01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:01.261]  Oh, yeah, of course.
[01:57:01.781 --> 01:57:07.874]  The good news is that Blackquad and others are actually behind the scenes putting large portions of their money rolling this up.
[01:57:08.255 --> 01:57:09.177]  Think about this though.
[01:57:10.029 --> 01:57:24.596]  You know, how many people, how many soldiers, how many active duty police officers, you know, Marines, Air Force, Army, all that are literally going to sit back if Hillary steals this and fights her wars, goes against Russia, goes and fights these people.
[01:57:24.696 --> 01:57:26.676]  I was about to say, look at the FBI against her.
[01:57:26.717 --> 01:57:27.657]  She's got to know it's over.
[01:57:27.717 --> 01:57:28.257]  No, I mean.
[01:57:28.277 --> 01:57:29.318]  These people aren't scared of her.
[01:57:29.378 --> 01:57:32.159]  Even if she somehow steals it, she has lost it.
[01:57:32.599 --> 01:57:34.040]  She has lost America.
[01:57:34.997 --> 01:57:37.759]  She has lost the majority of people out there.
[01:57:37.799 --> 01:57:40.000]  Now, they might have George Soros money.
[01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:43.142]  They might have 16 different states that they can control machines in.
[01:57:43.502 --> 01:57:47.024]  They might have all of this rigged, but they can't rig the American soul.
[01:57:47.084 --> 01:57:48.325]  They can't rig our spirit.
[01:57:48.345 --> 01:57:49.185]  Oh my God, there it is.
[01:57:49.225 --> 01:57:49.826]  They can't.
[01:57:50.246 --> 01:57:52.187]  Hillary can't rig the American soul.
[01:57:52.227 --> 01:57:55.469]  We gotta use that as some intro piece because that's it, Joe.
[01:57:55.589 --> 01:57:56.269]  They can't take it.
[01:58:26.429 --> 01:58:30.471]  ...take clips out of the show and obviously post it to YouTube and other channels to reach people.
[01:58:30.771 --> 01:58:31.992]  This is an information war.
[01:58:32.432 --> 01:58:33.232]  It's happening right now.
[01:58:33.312 --> 01:58:34.953]  Here is Obama flipping out yesterday.
[01:58:34.973 --> 01:58:36.694]  ...religions from our country.
[01:58:37.915 --> 01:58:40.736]  We can't afford a commander-in-chief who insults POWs.
[01:58:42.296 --> 01:58:44.157]  Or attacks... No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[01:58:44.257 --> 01:58:44.578]  Hold up!
[01:58:44.658 --> 01:58:45.098]  Hold up!
[01:58:45.678 --> 01:58:46.158]  Hold up!
[01:58:47.119 --> 01:58:47.519]  Hold up!
[01:58:47.879 --> 01:58:48.279]  Hold up!
[01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:50.460]  Hey, hold up!
[01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:50.960]  Hold up!
[01:58:53.201 --> 01:58:53.542]  Hold up!
[01:58:53.622 --> 01:58:54.282]  We're talking.
[01:58:56.786 --> 01:58:56.886]  Hey!
[01:58:56.946 --> 01:58:57.126]  Hold up!
[01:58:57.166 --> 01:58:57.486]  Hold up!
[01:58:57.527 --> 01:58:57.667]  Hold up!
[01:58:57.687 --> 01:58:58.627]  Hold up, hold up, hold up!
[01:58:58.647 --> 01:59:00.308]  Hey, listen, listen, listen, listen!
[01:59:00.348 --> 01:59:01.069]  Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[01:59:26.892 --> 01:59:28.493]  Listen up!
[01:59:28.573 --> 01:59:30.054]  Hey, everybody!
[01:59:30.154 --> 01:59:31.194]  Everybody!
[01:59:31.314 --> 01:59:32.155]  Hey!
[01:59:32.255 --> 01:59:32.555]  Hey!
[01:59:32.915 --> 01:59:34.116]  Listen up!
[01:59:34.376 --> 01:59:34.596]  Hey!
[01:59:34.916 --> 01:59:39.198]  I told you to be focused and you're not focused right now!
[01:59:39.258 --> 01:59:42.500]  Listen to what I'm saying!
[01:59:42.580 --> 01:59:43.561]  Hold up!
[01:59:43.841 --> 01:59:44.301]  Hold up!
[01:59:45.442 --> 01:59:45.862]  Hold up!
[01:59:45.962 --> 01:59:47.463]  Hold up!
[01:59:48.243 --> 01:59:52.165]  Everybody sit down and be quiet for a second!
[01:59:52.245 --> 01:59:54.206]  Everybody sit down and be quiet for a second!
[01:59:57.264 --> 02:00:00.005]  Now listen up, I'm serious, listen up.
[02:00:01.705 --> 02:00:05.187]  You've got an older gentleman who is supporting his candidate.
[02:00:07.427 --> 02:00:08.528]  He's not doing nothing.
[02:00:08.608 --> 02:00:13.569]  You don't have to worry about him.
[02:00:14.870 --> 02:00:17.231]  This is what I mean about folks not being focused.
[02:00:17.251 --> 02:00:23.293]  First of all, first of all, hold up.
[02:00:35.632 --> 02:00:37.496]  People should not be afraid of their governments.
[02:00:37.516 --> 02:00:39.900]  Governments should be afraid of them.
[02:01:07.583 --> 02:01:10.654]  Several party members have been murdered, Chief Inspector.
[02:01:17.797 --> 02:01:21.940]  We're interrupting your regularly scheduled program to bring you this terrifying report.
[02:01:22.020 --> 02:01:24.502]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[02:01:25.062 --> 02:01:26.583]  It just pancaked.
[02:01:27.043 --> 02:01:30.806]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[02:01:31.086 --> 02:01:33.808]  New York, very much a city still in chaos.
[02:01:33.868 --> 02:01:38.151]  The phones are not working properly, the subway lines are not working properly.
[02:01:38.191 --> 02:01:42.954]  The sky now blank with smoke in front of us, just across the Tigris River here.
[02:01:43.534 --> 02:01:47.557]  This is shock and awe, Tom, to the population of Baghdad.
[02:01:48.518 --> 02:01:50.219]  Shock and awe, indeed.
[02:01:50.679 --> 02:01:56.523]  The people you liberate will witness the honorable and decent spirit of the American military.
[02:01:56.663 --> 02:01:59.625]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:01:59.945 --> 02:02:00.566]  Come on!
[02:02:02.827 --> 02:02:04.248]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:04.808 --> 02:02:05.869]  A new world order.
[02:02:06.109 --> 02:02:06.850]  I love my dad.
[02:02:08.064 --> 02:02:09.325]  I'd kill for him.
[02:02:09.345 --> 02:02:11.287]  I'd go to prison for him because I love him so much.
[02:02:11.467 --> 02:02:12.488]  I love Bill Clinton.
[02:02:12.528 --> 02:02:14.890]  What does that make Hillary Clinton to the Bush family?
[02:02:15.671 --> 02:02:16.471]  My sister-in-law.
[02:02:16.571 --> 02:02:22.437]  When you are subverting the power of government, that's a fundamentally dangerous thing to democracy.
[02:02:22.457 --> 02:02:23.838]  What do you think of Edward Snowden?
[02:02:24.756 --> 02:02:25.517]  I think he's a traitor.
[02:02:25.777 --> 02:02:27.619]  Obama is the one that kills the U.S.
[02:02:27.659 --> 02:02:29.240]  troops if the Russians bomb any of them.
[02:02:29.460 --> 02:02:31.302]  Obama is the one that put them in harm's way.
[02:02:31.442 --> 02:02:33.724]  Obama is the one using them as human shields.
[02:02:33.884 --> 02:02:38.147]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate, criminal government in American history.
[02:02:38.227 --> 02:02:39.188]  I'm here to warn people!
[02:02:39.228 --> 02:02:40.489]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:41.670]  This isn't a game!
[02:02:46.267 --> 02:02:47.608]  Welcome to America, ISIS!
[02:02:47.628 --> 02:02:48.749]  This is what we do!
[02:02:48.949 --> 02:02:49.409]  Woo!
[02:02:50.410 --> 02:02:53.332]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[02:02:53.472 --> 02:02:55.153]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[02:02:55.193 --> 02:02:56.474]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[02:02:56.934 --> 02:03:06.321]  In 2012, your agency was saying, quote, the Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Al-Qaeda in Iraq are the major forces driving the insurgents in Syria.
[02:03:06.501 --> 02:03:10.183]  In 2012, the US was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups.
[02:03:10.663 --> 02:03:11.664]  Why did you not stop that?
[02:03:11.744 --> 02:03:12.905]  Why didn't you come forward before?
[02:03:13.165 --> 02:03:14.306]  What were you waiting for?
[02:03:14.526 --> 02:03:15.887]  Well, for you, Inspector.
[02:03:16.928 --> 02:03:17.668]  I needed you.
[02:03:18.349 --> 02:03:27.597]  I suddenly had this feeling that everything was connected.
[02:03:27.737 --> 02:03:34.163]  We're all part of it.
[02:03:34.183 --> 02:03:35.183]  Are we ready for it?
[02:03:37.365 --> 02:03:42.370]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:03:44.909 --> 02:03:48.011]  Welcome to this Saturday evening special edition broadcast.
[02:03:48.151 --> 02:03:49.972]  Owen Schroer here with Joe Biggs.
[02:03:50.032 --> 02:03:57.516]  And folks, if you like the fact that Alex Jones hires reporters like me and Joe Biggs, go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:03:57.856 --> 02:03:58.877]  Please buy our products.
[02:03:59.237 --> 02:04:01.879]  That's how Alex has been able to expand this operation.
[02:04:01.919 --> 02:04:04.280]  He was talking about earlier how he doesn't take much sponsors.
[02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:05.781]  I would actually disagree with Alex.
[02:04:05.801 --> 02:04:10.524]  I think Alex has more sponsors than anybody else in media because you are the sponsor, folks.
[02:04:11.124 --> 02:04:15.950]  You sponsor our programming by buying the great products at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:04:16.370 --> 02:04:17.371]  I'm a user myself.
[02:04:17.631 --> 02:04:20.995]  I know that most of the crew around here are users as well.
[02:04:21.456 --> 02:04:22.417]  They're good products, folks.
[02:04:22.537 --> 02:04:25.360]  Alex Jones would not put his name on it if it wasn't good.
[02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:27.402]  I'm an avid BrainForce user.
[02:04:27.482 --> 02:04:28.103]  Is that your favorite?
[02:04:28.163 --> 02:04:31.287]  Actually, before, on the break, when I stepped away, I went and I took two BrainForce.
[02:04:31.627 --> 02:04:31.847]  Yeah.
[02:04:31.867 --> 02:04:33.048]  So maybe I'll be more powerful.
[02:04:33.168 --> 02:04:41.515]  I was pretty droopy earlier and I took those and it's kind of cool because you know when you drink energy drinks it gets you jittery or you can kind of tell you're on it.
[02:04:41.895 --> 02:04:45.418]  When you take this it's almost like a natural awakening.
[02:04:45.518 --> 02:04:50.482]  You kind of just all of a sudden kind of you know it's like an hour later you go hold on I'm not tired anymore why is that?
[02:04:51.023 --> 02:04:59.369]  And then you go oh yeah I took that I forgot like that's how it is it sneaks up on you and you can't tell you're on something so that's why I like it which is why I take it more than anything.
[02:04:59.409 --> 02:05:01.231]  I take it probably at least once or twice a day.
[02:05:01.451 --> 02:05:03.192]  Well, and it's all natural ingredients, too.
[02:05:03.292 --> 02:05:09.457]  You know, it's stuff that your body craves, that it uses to fuel itself, and that's why you get that natural sensation of energy.
[02:05:09.957 --> 02:05:10.898]  BrainForce is a great product.
[02:05:10.918 --> 02:05:11.398]  I just took it.
[02:05:11.518 --> 02:05:12.058]  So there you go.
[02:05:12.219 --> 02:05:13.780]  Endorsing the product that I just took.
[02:05:14.485 --> 02:05:15.265]  Now, you know what?
[02:05:16.225 --> 02:05:18.806]  I was gonna get into this story, but real quick, Joe, it's funny.
[02:05:19.166 --> 02:05:23.767]  We were both out together last night, and we were talking about how we were tired and we took the brain force.
[02:05:24.307 --> 02:05:38.589]  But last night, Joe Biggs and I, we were out, we were letting some stress off, having some cold beverages, and Joe had his Hillary for Prison t-shirt on, and he triggered some people, to say the least.
[02:05:38.649 --> 02:05:40.210]  A lot of people were triggered, folks.
[02:05:40.830 --> 02:05:42.310]  There was one girl in particular
[02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:45.952]  And Joe, actually, I think that you missed the fireworks for this one.
[02:05:45.992 --> 02:05:48.153]  I think that you took off before she completely blew up.
[02:05:48.213 --> 02:05:49.214]  She slapped a guy.
[02:05:49.234 --> 02:05:51.135]  I mean, she completely went off the hinges.
[02:05:52.036 --> 02:05:55.318]  So, I'm gonna tell you... I triggered someone so bad, she slapped another person.
[02:05:55.358 --> 02:05:55.638]  Yes.
[02:05:55.998 --> 02:05:56.279]  Yes.
[02:05:56.779 --> 02:05:57.419]  Yes.
[02:05:57.499 --> 02:05:59.841]  And this was not even the girl that you were originally triggering.
[02:05:59.861 --> 02:06:00.982]  You were triggering a lot of folks.
[02:06:01.022 --> 02:06:01.622]  You and your buddy.
[02:06:01.902 --> 02:06:04.204]  We had two Hillary for Prison shirts at the bar last night.
[02:06:04.864 --> 02:06:07.506]  But, I'm gonna tease this right now, folks.
[02:06:07.846 --> 02:06:13.170]  On Monday night, I will be live from 10pm to 12am, part of the 52-hour broadcast.
[02:06:13.650 --> 02:06:18.554]  We are going to debut female age Skrillex, folks.
[02:06:18.954 --> 02:06:22.037]  We caught a wild female age Skrillex.
[02:06:22.457 --> 02:06:23.458]  I'm not kidding you.
[02:06:23.858 --> 02:06:25.079]  We've all seen age Skrillex.
[02:06:25.279 --> 02:06:27.701]  We caught the female age Skrillex last night at the bar.
[02:06:28.482 --> 02:06:32.645]  Unbelievable footage, and it is the girl who slapped the guy in the face.
[02:06:33.586 --> 02:06:34.326]  Shocking stuff.
[02:06:34.426 --> 02:06:37.589]  Okay, so beyond that, I do want to let you know, let's open up the phone lines.
[02:06:37.609 --> 02:06:38.229]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[02:06:38.249 --> 02:06:38.510]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[02:06:43.254 --> 02:06:49.181]  7-8-9 Alex and we will start taking your phone calls here once we get those lines busy.
[02:06:49.221 --> 02:06:51.624]  But a couple of news stories we want to get to first.
[02:06:52.025 --> 02:06:55.949]  Now what I have on my desk in front of me, this is a Zero Hedge article.
[02:06:56.911 --> 02:06:59.814]  ISIS calls for slaughter of Americans on election day.
[02:07:00.535 --> 02:07:12.441]  Now this is on the heels of the FBI terror alert being raised for next week, specifically citing threats in New York, Texas, and Virginia.
[02:07:12.501 --> 02:07:14.482]  And as I was talking to Matt outside,
[02:07:15.666 --> 02:07:27.552]  These are states that could swing the election, Joe, because Texas is typically red, a very big number of electoral college votes there for Texas that Trump needs.
[02:07:27.572 --> 02:07:31.935]  It's kind of like the superdelegate for the red side, if you will, like California is the superdelegate for the blue.
[02:07:32.275 --> 02:07:37.458]  Then you've got New York, where Donald Trump is from, where I guess you could think that maybe he has a chance.
[02:07:38.098 --> 02:07:40.701]  To win in New York, considering he's from there.
[02:07:41.182 --> 02:07:45.046]  And I think people in New York, they know about Hillary and how corrupt she is.
[02:07:45.107 --> 02:07:46.889]  So maybe there's a chance he can pull out New York.
[02:07:47.429 --> 02:07:49.972]  So is this a measured thing?
[02:07:50.052 --> 02:07:53.937]  Do you think this is somehow measured by the Clinton campaign, who we know?
[02:07:54.867 --> 02:07:58.148]  Has, if not direct ties, undirect ties to ISIS.
[02:07:58.769 --> 02:07:59.889]  I mean, this is voter suppression.
[02:07:59.909 --> 02:08:05.932]  They talk about Donald Trump and his supporters being guilty of voter intimidation.
[02:08:06.572 --> 02:08:11.734]  But, I mean, we could actually probably trace this back potentially to the Clinton campaign.
[02:08:12.175 --> 02:08:16.136]  And this is, again, another example of the Clinton campaign guilty of voter suppression.
[02:08:16.156 --> 02:08:17.777]  We already have it in Project Veritas.
[02:08:18.417 --> 02:08:21.559]  What do you think the odds are, Joe, that this is right out of the Clinton camp?
[02:08:22.301 --> 02:08:31.025]  To make people be scared to go vote that they're going to be attacked by a terrorist when they go to the polls in places like New York and Texas and Virginia.
[02:08:31.045 --> 02:08:33.586]  What do you think the odds are that this came out of the Democratic campaign?
[02:08:33.606 --> 02:08:38.349]  I have one thing, and everybody grab your mobile device, get on your computer, everybody do this right now.
[02:08:38.989 --> 02:08:41.110]  Hashtag Alex Jones was right.
[02:08:42.503 --> 02:08:44.425]  Yeah, you started that on Friday.
[02:08:44.465 --> 02:08:52.195]  Go back to March, to April, to May, to June, July, with Alex, with Jerome Corsi, with many other people, other guests.
[02:08:52.695 --> 02:08:53.636]  Alex has been calling.
[02:08:53.937 --> 02:08:55.579]  He goes, hey, if it gets tight,
[02:08:56.775 --> 02:09:16.544]  Be aware, he says, don't be surprised if there is a false flag attack, some kind of attack that happens on or before election day to really just screw things up, scare people, keep them from going out, or it's so bad that Obama calls for it to be held off, he stays in office for a while until things get worked out.
[02:09:16.944 --> 02:09:20.206]  You know, so don't be surprised to see something like that actually happen.
[02:09:20.686 --> 02:09:22.127]  You know, and that's what he called for.
[02:09:22.248 --> 02:09:27.152]  And then, you know, Thursday, I believe it was, the article broke on Drudge, or maybe it was Friday, yesterday.
[02:09:27.673 --> 02:09:30.836]  I saw that headline and I go, oh my god, I was like, Alex was right.
[02:09:31.336 --> 02:09:32.698]  You know, and I stayed up all night.
[02:09:32.778 --> 02:09:40.005]  I even saw Leanne McAdoo tweet out, she goes, I can't believe I live in a world where everything that Alex Jones says has come true.
[02:09:40.525 --> 02:09:40.846]  You know?
[02:09:40.866 --> 02:09:44.749]  And he had the mainstream media saying, I don't want to live in a world where Alex Jones is right!
[02:09:45.550 --> 02:09:46.191]  Well, guess what?
[02:09:46.231 --> 02:09:49.334]  We are living that life right now.
[02:09:49.474 --> 02:09:52.477]  Everything he's been predicting up to this point has come true.
[02:09:52.517 --> 02:09:54.058]  And when Drudge... And his guests, too.
[02:09:54.279 --> 02:09:55.019]  Yeah.
[02:09:55.059 --> 02:09:58.583]  When that headline hit, it just struck me like a punch in the face.
[02:09:59.003 --> 02:10:00.825]  I was like, oh my God, Alex Jones was right.
[02:10:00.845 --> 02:10:06.751]  So I want to see everybody right now get on Twitter, hashtag Alex Jones was right, and tweet out why he was right.
[02:10:07.051 --> 02:10:22.519]  Talk about his predictions, talk about what he said was going to happen, and show it, prove it with articles so people can engage in that conversation and we can get some information out there, some knowledge, because once you understand the demon, once you understand how this machine works, you can understand what's going to happen down the road.
[02:10:22.799 --> 02:10:29.443]  And Alex has been able to look at these little pieces and see the whole picture in advance before a lot of us do because, you know,
[02:10:30.179 --> 02:10:30.980]  That's a smart guy.
[02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:35.264]  He's able to see this stuff and he was able to piece that together that that would happen.
[02:10:35.304 --> 02:10:35.885]  And here we are.
[02:10:36.185 --> 02:10:40.890]  We have this threat to Texas, Virginia, New York could be attacked by Al Qaeda.
[02:10:41.350 --> 02:10:42.391]  You know, so guess what?
[02:10:42.432 --> 02:10:42.992]  Today I went out.
[02:10:43.032 --> 02:10:44.554]  I got all my my ammunition.
[02:10:44.574 --> 02:10:47.116]  I got all my my kits, my weapons.
[02:10:47.176 --> 02:10:48.438]  I'm going to bring them to work Monday.
[02:10:48.498 --> 02:10:52.242]  You know, if they come by, I will be ready to tear that butt up.
[02:10:52.502 --> 02:10:52.942]  And this is.
[02:10:53.723 --> 02:10:56.464]  These are some of the potentials I was talking about earlier with Alex.
[02:10:56.724 --> 02:10:59.165]  All the different potentials we have staring in front of us.
[02:10:59.365 --> 02:11:01.506]  Dozens, honestly, and it all affects all of us.
[02:11:01.546 --> 02:11:12.030]  But apparently this is just breaking, and if you guys could actually look into this, I'm being told there was a gunman at the Trump rally in Reno, Nevada just now, and they had to take him down.
[02:11:13.171 --> 02:11:18.913]  I'm being told that Secret Service had to remove Donald Trump from Reno because there was a gunman.
[02:11:19.593 --> 02:11:21.794]  So I don't know if there's a story on this right now.
[02:11:22.395 --> 02:11:22.895]  If you guys can...
[02:11:23.703 --> 02:11:24.328]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:11:26.246 --> 02:11:27.006]  Okay, okay.
[02:11:27.026 --> 02:11:28.567]  So we're going to find out if that's true.
[02:11:28.787 --> 02:11:31.508]  Oh, so since you're bringing that up, I'm glad you said that.
[02:11:31.848 --> 02:11:34.530]  So there's a rioter for Huffington Post, Ryan J. Riley.
[02:11:34.890 --> 02:11:35.870]  I can't stand this guy.
[02:11:35.910 --> 02:11:37.071]  He's the biggest cuck in the world.
[02:11:37.451 --> 02:11:39.192]  So if you listen... Biggest in the world?
[02:11:39.632 --> 02:11:43.653]  I'm telling you, I vote for him every year and he's my champion for the biggest cuck ever.
[02:11:44.054 --> 02:11:46.555]  This guy is a horrible reporter, horrible excuse as a journalist.
[02:11:46.855 --> 02:11:52.337]  He's the guy in Ferguson who took pictures of these foam earbuds and goes, are these rubber bullets?
[02:11:52.357 --> 02:11:53.158]  Can anyone confirm?
[02:11:53.198 --> 02:11:53.958]  And tweeted it out.
[02:11:54.358 --> 02:11:59.683]  There were clearly the orange foam earbuds you put in there.
[02:11:59.723 --> 02:12:02.145]  This guy's like tweeting out their rubber bullets.
[02:12:02.365 --> 02:12:03.766]  It's not even rubber, it's foam.
[02:12:04.246 --> 02:12:13.835]  So either way, this guy takes a picture of a guy outside of a Trump rally and goes, oh my god, white Trump supporter stands outside a rally with a gun on his hip.
[02:12:14.075 --> 02:12:14.695]  How dare he?
[02:12:14.795 --> 02:12:22.382]  And I'm like, wow, let's attack the law-abiding gun owner who's open carry in an open carry state.
[02:12:22.682 --> 02:12:23.483]  He's white, though.
[02:12:23.503 --> 02:12:25.084]  Oh yeah, because he's white, yeah.
[02:12:25.844 --> 02:12:27.965]  Ryan J. Reilly, he's the biggest cuck ever.
[02:12:28.005 --> 02:12:28.686]  I can't stand this guy.
[02:12:28.706 --> 02:12:36.511]  Look, the female-age Skrillex that we captured last night, I mean, she literally gave me the exact same rundown that age Skrillex gave me.
[02:12:36.571 --> 02:12:38.552]  I mean, it's honestly uncanny.
[02:12:38.672 --> 02:12:43.295]  I can't even keep up with all the people I triggered last night because it was like a... You were loving it, though.
[02:12:43.355 --> 02:12:46.357]  I mean, Joe is literally out here just like, Rah!
[02:12:46.397 --> 02:12:47.938]  Hillary for prison!
[02:12:48.358 --> 02:12:50.840]  And you've got all these bat-crazy loons like,
[02:12:53.989 --> 02:12:59.876]  I've actually got the live feed here from right side of Trump right now and it looks like he's still speaking.
[02:13:00.316 --> 02:13:01.317]  They're showing it's live.
[02:13:01.377 --> 02:13:04.401]  So let's keep tabs on this.
[02:13:04.441 --> 02:13:08.605]  Yeah, let's keep tabs on this because I'm actually getting this from people who were there.
[02:13:09.106 --> 02:13:11.208]  So I don't know if that's delayed or I don't know what's going on.
[02:13:11.448 --> 02:13:12.269]  We'll keep tabs on this.
[02:13:12.349 --> 02:13:13.591]  Once again, we're going to take your calls.
[02:13:15.473 --> 02:13:19.996]  Uh, well, I, I, somebody told me that there was a gunman, that Alex Jones is rejoining us here.
[02:13:20.016 --> 02:13:26.741]  Someone told me there was a gunman at the Trump rally and he had to get removed, but the crew just pulled it up live and he was still on stage, so we're gonna... We should be praying for Trump.
[02:13:27.202 --> 02:13:27.722]  No doubt.
[02:13:28.082 --> 02:13:29.343]  We should all pray, let's pray for Trump.
[02:13:29.764 --> 02:13:30.524]  No doubt.
[02:13:30.584 --> 02:13:31.865]  Thank God, please pray for Trump.
[02:13:32.185 --> 02:13:33.266]  Alex, you wanna, you wanna lead us?
[02:13:33.286 --> 02:13:34.667]  No, just, please pray.
[02:13:34.687 --> 02:13:35.508]  Well folks, here's the deal.
[02:13:36.437 --> 02:13:40.161]  If you... I mean, it's coming to a point now where... It's a spiritual war!
[02:13:40.281 --> 02:13:40.802]  Exactly.
[02:13:40.942 --> 02:13:48.791]  We know what the people who have been running this government are up to, the people that fund them, we know what they're up to, we know what their agendas are, and it's not...
[02:13:51.514 --> 02:13:55.235]  Whether or not Trump is any of these things, he's fighting the corruption, folks.
[02:13:55.755 --> 02:13:56.035]  Okay?
[02:13:56.616 --> 02:14:00.137]  And we need Donald Trump to have Godspeed.
[02:14:00.537 --> 02:14:05.898]  We need the hand of God to be on Donald Trump while he is fighting this battle.
[02:14:06.038 --> 02:14:06.258]  Again.
[02:14:06.278 --> 02:14:09.439]  I was telling Alex earlier, you know... We're fighting exactly.
[02:14:09.459 --> 02:14:10.680]  We're fighting a spiritual enemy.
[02:14:10.700 --> 02:14:12.140]  They believe in it, we believe in God.
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:13.821]  We have to give them spiritual support.
[02:14:13.861 --> 02:14:14.281]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:14:14.901 --> 02:14:21.987]  No, I was telling Alex earlier, I was like, you know, Hillary can steal the election, but she can't steal the American spirit, and that's something that lives in all of us.
[02:14:22.007 --> 02:14:22.948]  That's what thousands have ever heard.
[02:14:23.188 --> 02:14:23.549]  I know.
[02:14:23.829 --> 02:14:30.174]  If they steal that election from us, you know, George Soros, 16 different states have their machines that they can manipulate.
[02:14:30.655 --> 02:14:33.877]  They can't steal the spirit that we have to fight every day.
[02:14:33.897 --> 02:14:34.278]  We're awake.
[02:14:34.438 --> 02:14:35.179]  We know they steal it.
[02:14:35.199 --> 02:14:37.060]  Our military is not going to sit back.
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:37.581]  We continue on.
[02:14:37.601 --> 02:14:39.242]  Our law enforcement is not going to take this.
[02:14:39.562 --> 02:14:41.984]  We already see within the FBI that there's an internal clue.
[02:14:42.004 --> 02:14:42.525]  That's their slogan.
[02:14:43.025 --> 02:14:43.566]  We gotta tweet it.
[02:14:43.706 --> 02:14:44.207]  Joe Biggs.
[02:14:44.447 --> 02:14:46.109]  Hillary cannot steal our spirit.
[02:14:46.289 --> 02:14:46.890]  And think about this.
[02:14:47.050 --> 02:14:49.432]  Every other move they've made... It's not like you can steal an election.
[02:14:49.652 --> 02:14:51.034]  You can't steal our spirit, Biggs.
[02:14:51.194 --> 02:14:54.858]  And every other move they've made has made patriotism rise.
[02:14:55.118 --> 02:15:01.385]  So if you put Hillary Clinton in, this country is going to be swarming with people like me and Joe Biggs, okay?
[02:15:01.745 --> 02:15:04.388]  Good luck trying to take this country down.
[02:15:05.330 --> 02:15:06.493]  We've got to tweak that though.
[02:15:06.633 --> 02:15:07.636]  Here we go.
[02:15:07.676 --> 02:15:08.818]  You cannot steal.
[02:15:09.179 --> 02:15:10.503]  You cannot steal our spirit.
[02:15:10.583 --> 02:15:13.570]  You can steal our election, but you can't steal our spirit, you witch!
[02:15:14.417 --> 02:15:18.040]  So there's the new uh... that was uh... they did apprehend a gunman at the rally.
[02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:24.566]  So breaking, man in Nevada allegedly carries firearm into Trump rally, Secret Service rushed Trump off stage.
[02:15:24.606 --> 02:15:25.727]  Did you guys see that live?
[02:15:25.887 --> 02:15:26.468]  What was the deal?
[02:15:26.888 --> 02:15:28.409]  It didn't look like it was live.
[02:15:28.490 --> 02:15:30.872]  Here, do you need your phone back?
[02:15:31.032 --> 02:15:36.096]  My buddy just texted me too, he's listening, he says, pull Trump stream up live and rewind eleven minutes, you can see.
[02:15:36.256 --> 02:15:37.458]  Rewind eleven and a half minutes.
[02:15:38.098 --> 02:15:39.099]  So here you go, folks.
[02:15:39.239 --> 02:15:40.980]  I don't know what to do.
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:42.682]  Every minute is game time, folks.
[02:15:42.722 --> 02:15:45.384]  This is why we're here on a Saturday night, okay?
[02:15:45.424 --> 02:15:46.765]  This is why we're here doing this broadcast.
[02:15:46.785 --> 02:15:49.988]  I got multiple people texting me now saying the same thing, so... I just tried to kill Trump.
[02:15:50.308 --> 02:15:52.390]  Somebody just... God damn devil warns me.
[02:15:52.570 --> 02:15:53.971]  All right, so here's the next move, obviously.
[02:15:53.991 --> 02:15:54.771]  No, I just got another one.
[02:15:54.791 --> 02:15:56.613]  There was an assassination attempt on Trump and Reno.
[02:15:56.693 --> 02:15:57.854]  Everybody's blowing up my phone now.
[02:15:57.874 --> 02:15:58.675]  Yeah, assassinate.
[02:15:58.695 --> 02:15:58.935]  See?
[02:15:59.395 --> 02:16:04.179]  So I wonder who tried to assassinate Trump, if this is what's truly going on.
[02:16:04.519 --> 02:16:05.400]  Could this have been an operative?
[02:16:05.420 --> 02:16:06.161]  I'm getting it up right now.
[02:16:06.201 --> 02:16:06.521]  Get ready.
[02:16:06.681 --> 02:16:07.682]  Could this have been an operative?
[02:16:07.762 --> 02:16:09.363]  Could this have been... Oh, here we go, here we go.
[02:16:09.523 --> 02:16:10.684]  Apparently we got it.
[02:16:12.265 --> 02:16:19.930]  I'm not sure if this is the footage of the moment where the gunman was apprehended, but we're going to try to find out.
[02:16:20.611 --> 02:16:26.095]  Maybe we can even... I wonder if we can get someone to call in who was actually at the event.
[02:16:26.295 --> 02:16:30.057]  Yeah, if you were there and you saw what happened, give us a call immediately.
[02:16:30.077 --> 02:16:31.578]  So apparently he's back on stage.
[02:16:31.618 --> 02:16:32.499]  He went off the stage.
[02:16:33.159 --> 02:16:33.360]  What?
[02:16:33.740 --> 02:16:34.761]  What a beast!
[02:16:35.635 --> 02:16:36.596]  What a beast!
[02:16:37.356 --> 02:16:38.517]  You can't try to kill me!
[02:16:38.557 --> 02:16:40.118]  He comes right back out on stage!
[02:16:40.138 --> 02:16:40.718]  I got it right here.
[02:16:40.738 --> 02:16:41.639]  We got it right here now.
[02:16:41.659 --> 02:16:42.479]  We're going to show it right now.
[02:16:42.499 --> 02:16:43.200]  We're going to show it with audio.
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:44.641]  We're going to back it up.
[02:16:44.661 --> 02:16:45.381]  Back it up at the beginning.
[02:16:45.881 --> 02:16:47.282]  They had to pull Trump off stage.
[02:16:47.862 --> 02:16:48.723]  They came with a gun.
[02:16:48.783 --> 02:16:49.363]  My God.
[02:16:49.423 --> 02:16:50.424]  I knew we had to be on the night.
[02:16:50.464 --> 02:16:51.285]  God, it's going to get so bad.
[02:16:51.565 --> 02:16:53.526]  Trump should probably stop public events at this point.
[02:16:53.826 --> 02:16:55.107]  The Satanists are so freaked out.
[02:16:55.247 --> 02:16:56.728]  He won't though.
[02:16:56.848 --> 02:17:04.033]  It says, look at this, there's a reporter, or no, Jack Posobiec is there, he goes, update Trump, back on stage in Reno, he's okay.
[02:17:04.333 --> 02:17:07.415]  Look at the balls it takes to have someone try to come and kill you.
[02:17:07.696 --> 02:17:08.696]  He goes back up there.
[02:17:08.756 --> 02:17:09.017]  Why?
[02:17:09.057 --> 02:17:11.378]  Because he doesn't even care about his own life.
[02:17:11.398 --> 02:17:11.879]  I agree.
[02:17:11.919 --> 02:17:13.680]  Let's rewind it and play the audio.
[02:17:14.020 --> 02:17:15.221]  Let's clip this out right now.
[02:17:15.721 --> 02:17:17.422]  Assassination attempt on Trump.
[02:17:17.903 --> 02:17:19.204]  My God, these people.
[02:17:19.764 --> 02:17:20.324]  That's so subtle.
[02:17:20.344 --> 02:17:21.105]  Oh, they got him right there.
[02:17:21.125 --> 02:17:21.846]  The guy with the gun.
[02:17:22.386 --> 02:17:23.727]  Let's back it up right now, guys.
[02:17:23.767 --> 02:17:24.187]  Back it up.
[02:17:24.227 --> 02:17:24.648]  Let's play it.
[02:17:25.128 --> 02:17:25.748]  Play it with audio.
[02:17:25.768 --> 02:17:26.029]  Get ready.
[02:17:26.049 --> 02:17:29.171]  For your community and protecting your family.
[02:17:29.191 --> 02:17:30.992]  So I guess, is this the live feed now?
[02:17:32.613 --> 02:17:33.194]  Okay, okay.
[02:17:33.234 --> 02:17:37.217]  By the way, folks, while we're at it... Great.
[02:17:44.702 --> 02:17:45.923]  So there's the moment right there.
[02:17:47.927 --> 02:17:50.669]  Gunman at the rally in Nevada.
[02:17:50.809 --> 02:17:52.951]  Secret Service has to take Trump off the stage.
[02:17:53.692 --> 02:17:55.974]  And he obviously infiltrated the actual event.
[02:17:58.836 --> 02:18:00.117]  Here you can see the commotion.
[02:18:00.197 --> 02:18:02.119]  Once again, folks, this is breaking right now.
[02:18:02.199 --> 02:18:10.165]  I hope they... A gunman at Donald Trump's event in Reno had to be apprehended by the military.
[02:18:10.465 --> 02:18:12.427]  Trump was rushed off stage by Secret Service.
[02:18:12.967 --> 02:18:14.148]  And then Donald Trump
[02:18:15.069 --> 02:18:19.753]  The cojones of Godzilla goes back out on the stage.
[02:18:19.813 --> 02:18:22.495]  Think about this though, but you know, here's the thing though.
[02:18:22.535 --> 02:18:24.097]  You've been to these events before, I have.
[02:18:24.457 --> 02:18:26.439]  You know how much security you have to go through?
[02:18:26.459 --> 02:18:26.619]  Right.
[02:18:26.759 --> 02:18:29.361]  So how in the hell does a guy get a gun past that?
[02:18:29.601 --> 02:18:32.844]  You've got to go through secret service, you've got to go through dogs, you've got to go through all this.
[02:18:33.004 --> 02:18:35.506]  I mean, I'm trying to think they don't do like a metal detector.
[02:18:35.526 --> 02:18:38.329]  I don't think they do a stage where they pat you down or anything like that.
[02:18:39.109 --> 02:18:40.949]  I guess maybe because I've gone through... They will now!
[02:18:41.210 --> 02:18:49.771]  I mean, maybe because I go through on the media side all the time, I have to go through and have Secret Service go through all my stuff, you know, wand me, bring a dog, buy my bags and all that.
[02:18:50.211 --> 02:18:54.772]  But, you know, from what I've always seen, there's heavy security just to get in these places, you know?
[02:18:55.033 --> 02:18:55.993]  This is amazing, Joe.
[02:18:57.213 --> 02:18:57.913]  I swear to you.
[02:18:58.033 --> 02:19:01.374]  Can we get a... What kind... That's the ultimate person.
[02:19:02.094 --> 02:19:04.936]  You're sitting out there fighting for America.
[02:19:04.956 --> 02:19:06.458]  Someone tries to kill you and you go, you know what?
[02:19:06.758 --> 02:19:07.479]  Most people would go.
[02:19:07.519 --> 02:19:13.163]  If that was Hillary Clinton, her ass would be in that van right now with a freaking syringe stuck in her arm.
[02:19:13.183 --> 02:19:13.964]  Yeah, they would have sedated her.
[02:19:13.984 --> 02:19:14.664]  Yeah, sedated.
[02:19:14.925 --> 02:19:16.306]  Going back home having nightmares.
[02:19:16.366 --> 02:19:17.106]  Trump goes, you know what?
[02:19:17.186 --> 02:19:18.267]  I'm going back out there.
[02:19:18.488 --> 02:19:20.329]  But America matters that much.
[02:19:20.369 --> 02:19:20.729]  Look at this.
[02:19:20.829 --> 02:19:22.991]  Can we get a document cam on me real quick here?
[02:19:23.011 --> 02:19:25.293]  This is actually crazy.
[02:19:26.414 --> 02:19:27.095]  Look at this right here.
[02:19:27.775 --> 02:19:29.396]  I was thinking about this.
[02:19:30.532 --> 02:19:32.754]  I wrote this down before I finished with Alex.
[02:19:32.834 --> 02:19:33.715]  Bob Marley quote.
[02:19:34.635 --> 02:19:41.501]  Years ago Bob Marley got shot and he went on stage and performed the next day.
[02:19:42.842 --> 02:19:43.742]  And you know what he said?
[02:19:43.762 --> 02:19:45.303]  He said the people
[02:19:46.124 --> 02:19:50.326]  Who do evil in this world, don't take a day off, how can I?
[02:19:51.106 --> 02:20:04.031]  And now here we have Donald Trump, a gunman, shows up at his rally, and that badass, that ultimate patriot, goes back on the stage to speak to his supporters.
[02:20:05.106 --> 02:20:10.653]  This is like, I mean, this guy, every rally he does something else that just absolutely kicks ass.
[02:20:11.233 --> 02:20:12.014]  This is unbelievable.
[02:20:12.034 --> 02:20:12.575]  So here's the deal.
[02:20:12.595 --> 02:20:16.399]  If we have anybody that we can get on the line that was at this rally, please call in.
[02:20:16.419 --> 02:20:18.822]  Phone lines are open.
[02:20:18.842 --> 02:20:19.984]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[02:20:20.424 --> 02:20:21.645]  Are we ready to take calls, guys?
[02:20:21.686 --> 02:20:22.707]  Can we go to this first caller?
[02:20:26.075 --> 02:20:29.517]  All right, let's go to Scott, who is in Seattle.
[02:20:29.617 --> 02:20:31.457]  He wants to talk about child trafficking in America.
[02:20:31.497 --> 02:20:35.699]  We just had a gunman get apprehended at a Donald Trump rally.
[02:20:35.719 --> 02:20:36.420]  You're seeing the footage.
[02:20:36.460 --> 02:20:37.980]  He then went back on stage.
[02:20:38.520 --> 02:20:40.621]  Unbelievable breaking developments here live on air.
[02:20:40.922 --> 02:20:41.542]  Go ahead, Scott.
[02:20:42.522 --> 02:20:42.962]  Wow!
[02:20:43.223 --> 02:20:44.663]  How much can I thank you guys?
[02:20:44.723 --> 02:20:47.985]  I've been part of the Survivor Network and trying to expose this stuff for a long time.
[02:20:48.045 --> 02:20:49.085]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[02:20:49.445 --> 02:20:53.307]  Well, you can thank us by going to InfoWarsTore.com, my friend, and we thank you for the support.
[02:20:56.117 --> 02:20:56.557]  I promise.
[02:20:56.838 --> 02:20:57.398]  Well, thank you.
[02:20:58.098 --> 02:21:09.083]  So, a quick tip before I ask my question, and that is what I've been fighting is that SLDS cult, the polygamous cult in Utah, that Warren Jeff guy went to jail.
[02:21:09.143 --> 02:21:12.224]  He went to jail, when he went to jail he had 75 wives.
[02:21:12.485 --> 02:21:19.908]  What I found out is they keep the girls and they sell the boys, that's 75 boys from the ages of 12 to 16, that all
[02:21:20.396 --> 02:21:24.779]  Well this is, I mean this is pretty easy logic for anyone with common sense.
[02:21:24.799 --> 02:21:26.641]  Where do all the victims of child kidnapping go?
[02:21:40.603 --> 02:21:41.804]  They don't just disappear.
[02:21:42.044 --> 02:21:44.686]  Just a week ago, the FBI did a raid.
[02:21:44.726 --> 02:21:45.966]  I believe it was in Minnesota.
[02:21:46.006 --> 02:21:51.209]  They rescued 82 children who had been sex slaves or in sex trafficking.
[02:21:51.229 --> 02:21:52.030]  Oh my God.
[02:21:52.110 --> 02:21:56.753]  And this is all happening, you know, after the NYPD and all that found Weiner's laptop.
[02:21:57.013 --> 02:21:58.033]  There's no telling what they found.
[02:21:58.054 --> 02:21:59.935]  I'm not saying there is a connection, but...
[02:22:00.675 --> 02:22:05.858]  They said, you know, based off of this Breitbart article and all that, that these guys are deep in that kind of stuff.
[02:22:06.398 --> 02:22:09.700]  So, I mean, it's disgusting to see that stuff kind of still go on.
[02:22:10.140 --> 02:22:16.903]  You know, it's something that, you know, you read about, you think it's, oh, that's so far gone, you know, that should be over by now, but it's still going on.
[02:22:16.943 --> 02:22:20.365]  There's still people right now who are slaves, who are captive in this country.
[02:22:20.845 --> 02:22:22.726]  So we've got breaking news.
[02:22:22.746 --> 02:22:29.350]  You know, obviously we found just yesterday links to perhaps the Clinton campaign and a child sex trafficking ring.
[02:22:29.370 --> 02:22:30.351]  We'll let that story develop.
[02:22:30.571 --> 02:22:35.334]  But then as we're live here on air, a gunman apprehended at the Donald Trump rally in Reno.
[02:22:35.754 --> 02:22:36.895]  Let's go back out to Scott.
[02:22:37.155 --> 02:22:37.996]  What other points did you have?
[02:22:39.133 --> 02:22:45.017]  Uh, my question was, you know, Thomas Jefferson told us that banks and corporations were more dangerous than standing armies.
[02:22:45.518 --> 02:22:50.841]  And I hear all this divisive rhetoric about left and right, liberal, everyone hates liberals or hates this.
[02:22:51.181 --> 02:22:56.665]  But the truth is that those corporations supported Cheney, and now they're supporting Hillary.
[02:22:56.685 --> 02:22:58.807]  That's nothing to do with liberal or conservative.
[02:22:59.387 --> 02:23:00.509]  Do you know what I'm saying?
[02:23:00.609 --> 02:23:07.176]  I'm asking whether we can start to look at the real enemies that Jefferson told us about, which are these transnational banks and corporations.
[02:23:07.436 --> 02:23:11.902]  And look, I'm just curious when liberals are going to face their own logic.
[02:23:11.922 --> 02:23:13.403]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[02:23:14.364 --> 02:23:15.845]  We talked about this a couple weeks ago.
[02:23:16.165 --> 02:23:19.586]  Now the Democrats, the quote-unquote liberals, are pro-war?
[02:23:20.186 --> 02:23:21.867]  Now the liberals want war with Russia?
[02:23:22.087 --> 02:23:31.831]  But then on the side of their mouth, when they're inciting you, when they're attacking you for liking Donald Trump, they say that you're the war candidate.
[02:23:32.011 --> 02:23:35.793]  They say that you like war, as their candidate is the war candidate!
[02:23:36.573 --> 02:23:37.053]  Exactly.
[02:23:37.273 --> 02:23:39.134]  They can't even face their own logic, Scott.
[02:23:41.045 --> 02:23:53.948]  It's the war profiteers that are our enemy, and whether they are clothed in liberal sheep clothing, or conservative sheep clothing, or neocon sheep clothing, it's the ones that make money off war that get profit of that that are the real enemies.
[02:23:54.008 --> 02:23:57.429]  And I think this divisive rhetoric, because I don't, am I a liberal conservative?
[02:23:57.489 --> 02:23:59.649]  I don't, I don't, I like Milo Yiannopoulos, right?
[02:23:59.669 --> 02:24:00.510]  Does that make me what?
[02:24:01.370 --> 02:24:06.051]  We have this fabulous, the dangerous faggot tour changing everything about the landscape of
[02:24:08.794 --> 02:24:15.202]  I feel topsy-turvy, but again, thank you, thank you, thank you for all of us that have been fighting this issue for so long.
[02:24:15.482 --> 02:24:17.345]  How can I tell you how grateful we are?
[02:24:18.151 --> 02:24:19.371]  Well, thank you for the call, Scott.
[02:24:19.671 --> 02:24:24.133]  And again, folks, if you want to thank us, go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:24:24.473 --> 02:24:26.354]  That's how you support this program.
[02:24:26.434 --> 02:24:31.015]  We do this for the same reason that you care about this country.
[02:24:31.055 --> 02:24:35.256]  We do this for the same reasons that you tune in, because we want to save this country.
[02:24:35.336 --> 02:24:37.737]  Infowarsstore.com, that's how you support us.
[02:24:38.237 --> 02:24:42.039]  Help fund the information war, especially in these critical times.
[02:24:42.159 --> 02:24:42.919]  Once again, folks,
[02:24:44.124 --> 02:24:46.850]  Tonight, Donald Trump speaking in Reno, Nevada.
[02:24:47.271 --> 02:24:50.177]  A gunman was apprehended inside the event.
[02:24:50.598 --> 02:24:51.600]  And then Donald Trump.
[02:24:52.642 --> 02:24:53.544]  Balls of steel.
[02:24:54.744 --> 02:24:58.468]  I guess they're probably gold, and then maybe plated with steel, and then maybe more gold.
[02:24:59.308 --> 02:25:10.439]  Goes back out, look at this, I mean, brushed off stage by Secret Service, and then he comes back out, puts his hands up, and he's like, hey, Teflon Don, I'm still here, let's do this, let's make America great again.
[02:25:11.139 --> 02:25:12.200]  Baller status right there.
[02:25:12.981 --> 02:25:17.866]  This is, I mean, it's just, that is, this is seriously unheard of.
[02:25:19.053 --> 02:25:21.334]  That is unheard of, folks.
[02:25:21.674 --> 02:25:23.535]  I can't even believe that this is going on.
[02:25:24.316 --> 02:25:26.297]  A gunman gets into the Trump rally.
[02:25:26.317 --> 02:25:27.657]  Who knows what his intentions were.
[02:25:27.697 --> 02:25:29.058]  We can all take our guess.
[02:25:30.279 --> 02:25:32.440]  And then Trump's rushed off stage, comes back out.
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:36.502]  Because that's how much this campaign means to him and us.
[02:25:36.782 --> 02:25:37.483]  And he knows that.
[02:25:37.563 --> 02:25:41.365]  There's a new WikiLeaks email that came out talking, it's between
[02:25:43.281 --> 02:25:54.904]  Some aid to John Podesta saying, in reference to Hillary Clinton, have her beat the S out of a punch doll or maybe a Stafford so she would be warm and charming in her next interview.
[02:25:55.444 --> 02:26:01.226]  During the height of the primaries, when she was doing morning show after morning show, she would be relatively unpleasant.
[02:26:01.526 --> 02:26:05.247]  But then, after acting out, she actually did good on her show.
[02:26:06.047 --> 02:26:16.503]  Showing that she has these huge raging fits and that her close associates are telling her to beat up staffers just so she can calm down to go on a show.
[02:26:16.823 --> 02:26:18.385]  Oh my god, what movie is it?
[02:26:18.445 --> 02:26:20.889]  That's literally a scene out of the movie.
[02:26:21.650 --> 02:26:35.385]  Where, I think it's the President or whatever, his staffer goes up to talk to him about what he's about to speak about, and the whole time the President is just slapping him, just mercilessly beating the crap out of him, starts throwing jabs, and then he's like, alright, you ready to go on?
[02:26:35.765 --> 02:26:37.767]  Punches him one more time and he goes, alright, now I'm ready.
[02:26:39.801 --> 02:26:47.190]  This election cycle we've seen so much of pop culture or movies or science fiction become reality right in front of our face.
[02:26:47.230 --> 02:26:49.853]  Here's another one from Brent Badowski to John Podesta.
[02:26:49.953 --> 02:26:54.739]  I just want to rattle off a few of these just in case you're listening you haven't been caught up on the WikiLeaks.
[02:26:54.799 --> 02:26:54.999]  It says
[02:26:55.640 --> 02:27:01.884]  It was not uplifting to learn in recent hours that problems with foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation continue.
[02:27:02.264 --> 02:27:06.326]  Hillary Clinton was still making paid speeches for hire this week.
[02:27:06.726 --> 02:27:10.289]  And Tony Rodham is hustling gold mining deals in Haiti.
[02:27:11.223 --> 02:27:25.021]  From the minute the email story broke, I have been out there publicly and unequivocally supporting Hillary Clinton in multiple ways, this guy writes, after telling you why you shouldn't and they're manipulating people with this Clinton Foundation.
[02:27:26.223 --> 02:27:35.973]  He's like, if there's one thing that could bring down Hillary Clinton candidacy, it is this cycle of money issues about which I am now feeling red alerts, loud bells, warning signals, and red flags.
[02:27:36.473 --> 02:27:40.978]  And the problem is, Donald Trump is right, though, because we already know all this.
[02:27:40.998 --> 02:27:41.478]  This is out.
[02:27:41.558 --> 02:27:43.020]  And it's not bringing them down.
[02:27:43.420 --> 02:27:45.302]  You have to bring them down.
[02:27:45.422 --> 02:27:46.523]  We have to bring them down.
[02:27:46.583 --> 02:27:47.384]  We know all this.
[02:27:47.684 --> 02:27:48.585]  The people have to act.
[02:27:48.665 --> 02:27:49.767]  It goes even further here.
[02:27:50.447 --> 02:27:54.952]  Leaked email exposes Hillary Clinton campaign paying for Bill Clinton's legal fees!
[02:27:55.653 --> 02:27:58.096]  That is totally illegal!
[02:27:58.396 --> 02:28:02.620]  They are using your money to pay for their personal expenses, folks.
[02:28:02.921 --> 02:28:04.202]  That is illegal.
[02:28:04.843 --> 02:28:05.103]  Okay?
[02:28:05.323 --> 02:28:05.924]  How do you like that?
[02:28:06.224 --> 02:28:09.848]  The Clinton Foundation's $20 million off the books mystery!
[02:28:10.939 --> 02:28:12.201]  The troubles continue.
[02:28:12.502 --> 02:28:20.354]  The inner workings of a mysterious off-the-books arm of the Clinton Foundation were partially revealed in the hacked emails of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.
[02:28:20.374 --> 02:28:21.215]  $20 million missing.
[02:28:23.581 --> 02:28:30.944]  And of course, there were billions of dollars that went missing from the State Department when Hillary Clinton was in charge over there.
[02:28:31.224 --> 02:28:32.765]  Remember the third and final debate?
[02:28:33.945 --> 02:28:37.847]  The moderator brings up, you know, what do you guys think about border security?
[02:28:38.487 --> 02:28:41.148]  And Hillary Clinton goes, oh, I think we should have a good strong border.
[02:28:41.168 --> 02:28:42.028]  And he goes, well, hold on.
[02:28:42.668 --> 02:28:47.150]  In the brand new WikiLeaks emails, it says that you called, or you dream of, open borders.
[02:28:47.390 --> 02:28:48.171]  And that was his speech.
[02:28:48.531 --> 02:28:49.891]  Yeah, and I have that right here.
[02:28:50.311 --> 02:28:50.672]  It says,
[02:28:51.832 --> 02:28:55.456]  Her dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open markets.
[02:28:55.896 --> 02:29:02.343]  She goes, my dream is to have open trade and open borders across the country, across the world.
[02:29:02.383 --> 02:29:03.484]  We need to have open borders.
[02:29:05.060 --> 02:29:05.720]  There you go, folks.
[02:29:05.800 --> 02:29:07.601]  Again, we know who the Clintons are.
[02:29:07.621 --> 02:29:08.622]  They've been exposed.
[02:29:08.862 --> 02:29:10.082]  It's not bringing them down.
[02:29:10.222 --> 02:29:13.083]  It's up to we, the people, to bring these people to justice.
[02:29:13.404 --> 02:29:16.865]  And I think that we're starting to see this movement in a very powerful way.
[02:29:16.945 --> 02:29:22.628]  And just a reminder, you know, like you said, if they steal this election, they still can't steal who we are, what we fight for, you know.
[02:29:22.788 --> 02:29:25.569]  And it's going to take, you know, us standing up.
[02:29:26.129 --> 02:29:41.676]  You know, sometimes, uh, you know, in the military when you get a bad leader, sometimes it takes soldiers, you know, when a, when a bad leader gives a command, those soldiers will turn their back on that guy for him to go, you know, maybe I'm being a dickhead, maybe I'm screwing up, you know, maybe I need to change what I'm doing to gain that trust back.
[02:29:42.156 --> 02:29:45.778]  Everybody in America, if this gets stolen, just needs to turn their back on her.
[02:29:46.138 --> 02:29:46.779]  Don't look at her.
[02:29:46.799 --> 02:29:47.639]  She's not going to get it back.
[02:29:47.979 --> 02:29:49.260]  Well, and you know, the thing is,
[02:29:50.950 --> 02:29:53.912]  You know, you can only push the American people so far.
[02:29:53.932 --> 02:30:01.836]  And it doesn't matter, American people, any population, you can only push them so far until the pushback becomes stronger than your push.
[02:30:01.876 --> 02:30:02.476]  That's inevitable.
[02:30:02.516 --> 02:30:03.096]  You're outnumbered.
[02:30:03.737 --> 02:30:06.318]  And we're starting to see this pushback.
[02:30:08.439 --> 02:30:11.201]  It's honestly unbelievable that all of this is going on.
[02:30:11.241 --> 02:30:20.987]  We know it's going on, and still you have such a majority of the population just totally incoherent, clueless, ignorant to any of this actually going on.
[02:30:21.027 --> 02:30:24.930]  Of course, that's not our audience, and we salute the fellow info warriors out there.
[02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:26.151]  Let's go back out to the phone lines.
[02:30:26.171 --> 02:30:29.713]  Let's go to Marty in Texas, wants to talk about media collusion.
[02:30:29.753 --> 02:30:30.314]  Go ahead, Marty.
[02:30:31.839 --> 02:30:31.959]  Hi.
[02:30:32.880 --> 02:30:36.922]  First of all, I must say I share Alex's rage and angst.
[02:30:37.963 --> 02:30:42.005]  Nobody that's human could not feel any differently.
[02:30:43.226 --> 02:30:44.207]  Here's the deal, Marty.
[02:30:44.227 --> 02:30:45.667]  Here's the deal, too, okay?
[02:30:45.928 --> 02:30:47.949]  Like I said, you can only push people so far.
[02:30:49.610 --> 02:30:51.891]  People are ready to act, folks.
[02:30:51.971 --> 02:30:52.772]  It's getting absurd.
[02:30:53.012 --> 02:30:56.534]  If they steal this election, if they try to thwart our movement,
[02:30:57.671 --> 02:31:00.620]  Arrogantly, right in front of the entire world.
[02:31:01.383 --> 02:31:02.506]  Americans aren't going to stand for that.
[02:31:03.837 --> 02:31:10.420]  Well, I pray you're right, because clearly they are, and that brings me to the point of my call.
[02:31:10.780 --> 02:31:21.204]  And that is, in my 60 years on this planet, and having voted in and followed numerous elections, etc., I have never in my life seen anything like this.
[02:31:21.644 --> 02:31:28.527]  And the real point is, any one of these scandals should have been enough to have her hauled away and ironed.
[02:31:28.847 --> 02:31:33.129]  But as you so eloquently put it, because of the fluoridated
[02:31:33.809 --> 02:31:34.350]  We're good.
[02:31:55.760 --> 02:32:11.230]  I don't care if people don't like me, whatever the case is, I have to do what's best for my children and my country, but the fix is in so broadly that none of this penetrates and gets out there.
[02:32:11.511 --> 02:32:17.815]  But I do have a solution, and I alluded to this in a comment on one of your awesome Facebook mentions, and that was
[02:32:18.587 --> 02:32:23.288]  This needs to be, and it's not that difficult, put this information out everywhere.
[02:32:23.428 --> 02:32:24.068]  Retweet.
[02:32:24.549 --> 02:32:26.449]  Share on your Facebook timeline.
[02:32:26.509 --> 02:32:28.209]  Share in any groups that you have.
[02:32:28.289 --> 02:32:31.410]  In fact, groups are even better because everybody sees those posts.
[02:32:31.870 --> 02:32:32.631]  Put it up there.
[02:32:32.971 --> 02:32:38.272]  Of course, there is and could be Facebook and Twitter censorship, but let's try to push through that.
[02:32:38.852 --> 02:32:53.479]  If this information gets out there and reaches a critical mass situation, the regular media, whatever you want to call it, the in-the-tank media, will be forced to report on it or be rendered more irrelevant than they are.
[02:32:57.901 --> 02:33:00.262]  Here's an analogy I would use.
[02:33:00.682 --> 02:33:01.943]  Imagine if you have
[02:33:03.155 --> 02:33:13.960]  A lazy boss who, you've been slacking off at work, and your boss doesn't say anything, you slowly start to slack a little more and more, and the boss never says anything, and it just eventually spirals out of control.
[02:33:15.300 --> 02:33:16.301]  And no one holds you accountable.
[02:33:17.081 --> 02:33:18.702]  We are the boss of the government!
[02:33:19.841 --> 02:33:20.961]  We are their bosses.
[02:33:21.382 --> 02:33:29.405]  So when we don't hold them accountable, when we're lazy, when we let them get away with anything, they're going to do whatever they want.
[02:33:29.805 --> 02:33:31.086]  We have to be vigilant.
[02:33:31.426 --> 02:33:33.967]  So that's kind of my analogy here.
[02:33:34.107 --> 02:33:37.228]  Our rights, our constitution's like a muscle.
[02:33:37.688 --> 02:33:40.330]  If you don't exercise it, you don't use it, you get muscle atrophy.
[02:33:40.730 --> 02:33:43.551]  It goes down, it withers away, and eventually it's gone.
[02:33:43.971 --> 02:33:45.813]  So we have to exercise our rights.
[02:33:45.833 --> 02:33:56.482]  We have to understand what it is we have and we have to practice that and talk about it on a regular basis so people like the media can't falsify stuff and the government can't take it.
[02:33:56.802 --> 02:33:57.803]  Give them an inch, they take a mile.
[02:33:59.645 --> 02:34:03.087]  Okay, so thank you for the call, Marty.
[02:34:04.187 --> 02:34:06.028]  We appreciate you supporting the InfoWar.
[02:34:06.069 --> 02:34:22.818]  Now, again, breaking news as we were on air, gunman at the Donald Trump rally in Reno, Nevada, he went back on the stage to finish his speech after the gunman was apprehended, after Secret Service took him off the stage.
[02:34:23.158 --> 02:34:28.401]  We've now got an eyewitness to the event, Joe Bannister, calling in
[02:34:29.701 --> 02:34:32.904]  Joe, what did you see at this rally?
[02:34:35.166 --> 02:34:36.827]  Howdy, Joe Bannister here.
[02:34:37.027 --> 02:34:40.190]  I went to the Reno rally and it was phenomenal.
[02:34:41.651 --> 02:34:57.664]  First one I've been to, first Trump rally I've been to, basically what I saw was this really, you know, big, big guy, I mean big, buff guy was running toward me and the crowd that was around me at like breakneck speed.
[02:34:57.724 --> 02:34:58.365]  And this is in a
[02:34:59.830 --> 02:35:02.911]  A rally forum where you were standing room only.
[02:35:02.952 --> 02:35:04.132]  You could barely move.
[02:35:04.752 --> 02:35:12.216]  And this guy was bolting out from the center area to go out, you know, towards me.
[02:35:12.296 --> 02:35:14.017]  I was more on the perimeter.
[02:35:14.877 --> 02:35:19.199]  And just like he had the fear of heaven in his eyes.
[02:35:19.319 --> 02:35:26.922]  Like, you know, which you'd think, well, this could only mean somebody's got a bomb or a gun or a knife or something.
[02:35:28.945 --> 02:35:34.590]  He was whispering to other people what he had, why he was running so fast, and I couldn't hear him.
[02:35:36.852 --> 02:35:56.148]  But then an eyewitness told me, I interviewed her, I just haven't uploaded the video yet, but I interviewed her and she said that a guy was carrying a sign and apparently it had some, it was like purporting to be a pro-Trump sign, but it had some tape on it that would indicate it was anti-Trump.
[02:35:57.423 --> 02:36:10.313]  Uh, and the guy had a gun on his hip, and apparently there were at least four men, probably more, who made sure that he could not draw the gun out of his holster.
[02:36:10.333 --> 02:36:25.084]  So they basically all pressed down on the gun, kept it in the holster, and, you know, then of course the law enforcement swarmed him and just dogpiled on the guy, uh, and held him until law enforcement could cart him away.
[02:36:26.223 --> 02:36:29.925]  Do you know how he was able to get the gun into the event?
[02:36:29.985 --> 02:36:35.188]  Was there no process trying to, you know, metal detectors or anything like that before you walked in?
[02:36:35.208 --> 02:36:36.649]  You could just walk in with the firearm?
[02:36:38.110 --> 02:36:46.255]  Well, you know, as maybe listeners know, Nevada's a pretty, well, pro-Second Amendment state.
[02:36:46.295 --> 02:36:49.336]  There's certainly concealed carry, open carry here.
[02:36:50.497 --> 02:36:54.479]  But in the venue itself, there was TSA, you know,
[02:36:56.001 --> 02:37:00.642]  I can't stand them, but I guess at a Trump rally, you gotta have what you gotta have.
[02:37:00.722 --> 02:37:02.002]  So they had TSA there?
[02:37:03.863 --> 02:37:07.404]  So TSA is known to let everything get by them.
[02:37:07.784 --> 02:37:12.045]  Like 70% of all things that shouldn't get through TSA get through TSA.
[02:37:12.485 --> 02:37:14.185]  Pass them into the airport area.
[02:37:14.505 --> 02:37:17.306]  So TSA failed is what you're telling us right now, Joe?
[02:37:17.506 --> 02:37:19.587]  We already know they're a failure, but yeah.
[02:37:19.687 --> 02:37:21.007]  Yeah, so basically there was a
[02:37:22.611 --> 02:37:27.855]  There was, you know, the old-fashioned metal detector rectangle that you would walk through.
[02:37:27.875 --> 02:37:35.480]  There were TSA agents, two or three, to an area, and you basically had to give them anything you had that was metal.
[02:37:36.501 --> 02:37:42.084]  And then you passed through, and when I say metal, I mean like my cell phone, my charger, etc.
[02:37:42.405 --> 02:37:50.270]  That was handed to the TSA agent, and he would just examine it with his own, you know, touch and observance.
[02:37:51.024 --> 02:37:59.992]  And then you pass through this rectangular metal detector, and then there was a Secret Service uniformed officer who would wand you with the wand.
[02:38:00.592 --> 02:38:03.635]  Hold out your hands and give you a wand up and down.
[02:38:04.696 --> 02:38:08.919]  So that was the extent of the security measures that I was subjected to.
[02:38:09.319 --> 02:38:13.983]  As far as I could tell, everybody was subjected to the same procedures.
[02:38:16.065 --> 02:38:19.168]  Do you believe that this man's intent was to shoot Donald Trump?
[02:38:21.534 --> 02:38:23.215]  You know, I'm not sure.
[02:38:23.235 --> 02:38:35.463]  I mean, I can just tell you, conjecture-wise, it could be, you know, somebody, like I say, in Nevada, thankfully, you know, you can open carry, you can concealed carry with a permit.
[02:38:36.824 --> 02:38:45.710]  It could be that the guy is just one of these people that doesn't realize you don't bring a gun to a candidate, you know, candidate rally.
[02:38:47.531 --> 02:38:50.193]  But yeah, like I say, the eyewitness said that he was
[02:38:51.161 --> 02:38:56.724]  There was a commotion between the suspect and the other men around him.
[02:38:56.744 --> 02:39:09.090]  And I don't know if it's because what he was saying or what was on the sign or a combination of the two, but there was a verbal altercation between the suspect and the men around him.
[02:39:09.110 --> 02:39:12.392]  And then at some point, somebody saw the gun.
[02:39:12.412 --> 02:39:14.473]  I don't know if the guy reached for the gun.
[02:39:15.908 --> 02:39:30.619]  But I think the gun was definitely exposed because the other, the men who made sure the gun did not come out of the holster and took him down so law enforcement could arrive, they could see it was a gun, right?
[02:39:30.719 --> 02:39:34.182]  So he either flashed it, it was concealed, and he flashed it.
[02:39:35.074 --> 02:39:36.755]  Wow, this is some wild stuff.
[02:39:36.775 --> 02:39:37.355]  So somehow, an armed
[02:39:59.687 --> 02:40:10.913]  I guess we still don't know his intent or what led to the apprehension, but an armed man goes into the Trump rally, allegedly has some sort of altercation that
[02:40:12.014 --> 02:40:20.556]  Eventually leads to him being taken and apprehended and also Donald Trump being rushed off the stage by Secret Service.
[02:40:20.596 --> 02:40:21.996]  So this is wild.
[02:40:22.296 --> 02:40:23.897]  What was this man's intent?
[02:40:24.057 --> 02:40:25.057]  Was there any intent?
[02:40:25.417 --> 02:40:28.218]  How did he get into the event with a gun?
[02:40:28.838 --> 02:40:33.159]  These are the questions I suppose that we're going to be searching for the answers to.
[02:40:33.219 --> 02:40:36.640]  Joe, thank you so much for sharing your intel and your experience with us.
[02:40:37.665 --> 02:40:38.545]  My pleasure, gentlemen.
[02:40:38.566 --> 02:40:39.586]  Thanks for all you do.
[02:40:40.046 --> 02:40:40.927]  All right, thank you, sir.
[02:40:41.347 --> 02:40:46.410]  And I think we have some other people that are calling in now that were also at the rally.
[02:40:46.430 --> 02:40:49.451]  We're going to try to take all of your calls, so just be patient.
[02:40:49.911 --> 02:40:55.034]  But Sally, were you at the Trump rally in Reno?
[02:40:58.816 --> 02:40:59.656]  Sally, can you hear me?
[02:41:03.218 --> 02:41:04.319]  Was she at the rally, guys?
[02:41:07.964 --> 02:41:09.665]  I'm not sure what's wrong with Sally's phone.
[02:41:09.685 --> 02:41:10.746]  Sally, are you able to hear us?
[02:41:13.068 --> 02:41:18.132]  Alright, just go ahead and put her on hold, and let's see if she can't figure out her phone circumstance.
[02:41:19.152 --> 02:41:23.476]  In the meantime, let's go to O'Brien in Maryland.
[02:41:25.137 --> 02:41:25.897]  Go ahead, O'Brien.
[02:41:27.178 --> 02:41:28.059]  Yeah, hi.
[02:41:28.579 --> 02:41:36.645]  I just wanted to, you know, I just saw the same thing I saw on the last season of Bullets.com, and I'm still pretty shaken up about that.
[02:41:38.235 --> 02:41:41.918]  They're pulling the stops out everywhere now.
[02:41:41.938 --> 02:41:49.304]  I mean, they're rigging things to Hillary and everything else.
[02:41:49.405 --> 02:41:54.169]  And basically, they're pretty much pulling out all the stops.
[02:41:54.309 --> 02:42:00.474]  It's just one guy out there to basically go after him and basically, you know,
[02:42:02.859 --> 02:42:05.040]  Well, we don't know.
[02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:15.044]  We still don't know exactly what went down as far as what his intentions were or if he was, you know, trying to indeed shoot Donald Trump, but that's obviously what it looks like right now.
[02:42:15.104 --> 02:42:20.807]  I mean, that's naturally the first, I think, response that everybody would have to this event.
[02:42:22.448 --> 02:42:24.989]  So, yeah, I mean, it's just wild.
[02:42:25.029 --> 02:42:26.390]  Thank you for the call, O'Brien.
[02:42:27.010 --> 02:42:29.171]  So, Sally, let's see.
[02:42:29.251 --> 02:42:30.452]  Is your phone working now, Sally?
[02:42:30.472 --> 02:42:30.932]  Can you hear me?
[02:42:31.687 --> 02:42:32.587]  Yes, thank you.
[02:42:32.807 --> 02:42:35.648]  So, Sally, were you also at the rally?
[02:42:36.348 --> 02:42:38.729]  I was at the Jacksonville rally.
[02:42:39.669 --> 02:42:40.890]  It was actually in St.
[02:42:41.030 --> 02:42:46.232]  Augustine, and I had to go through the same metal detectors.
[02:42:46.272 --> 02:42:47.672]  There was one dog.
[02:42:48.872 --> 02:42:50.973]  There were two metal detectors.
[02:42:51.073 --> 02:42:57.255]  We were all wanted, but you could not take in a homemade sign, and I noticed that
[02:42:57.799 --> 02:43:02.021]  Somebody mentioned that that gentleman might have had a homemade sign.
[02:43:02.061 --> 02:43:03.442]  That is a no-no.
[02:43:03.662 --> 02:43:05.763]  At least it was for the rally I attended.
[02:43:06.203 --> 02:43:07.804]  Well, and think about this, too.
[02:43:08.044 --> 02:43:15.228]  You know, we know of stories where TSA gets a directive to let somebody through.
[02:43:16.440 --> 02:43:18.601]  I mean, could this be the type of thing we're looking at?
[02:43:19.041 --> 02:43:21.862]  Where there was some sort of a directive to let this guy in?
[02:43:21.982 --> 02:43:23.663]  Somehow he was able to skip TSA?
[02:43:23.723 --> 02:43:24.503]  Who is this guy?
[02:43:24.523 --> 02:43:26.684]  I mean, these are just the questions that come to my head.
[02:43:27.024 --> 02:43:31.646]  Again, Donald Trump, a gunman at the Trump rally, gets apprehended.
[02:43:31.706 --> 02:43:38.408]  And Sally here, this is now another caller who's explaining how they had to go through a metal detector just to get in.
[02:43:38.448 --> 02:43:39.629]  Thank you for the call, Sally.
[02:43:40.509 --> 02:43:41.249]  And that's typical.
[02:43:41.549 --> 02:43:46.131]  There was TSA from Wisconsin there in Florida.
[02:43:47.130 --> 02:43:54.264]  There were probably nine people in the van, and they all had Wisconsin badges on their arms.
[02:43:54.565 --> 02:43:57.531]  So they were bringing them in from all different areas.
[02:43:58.922 --> 02:44:01.443]  That was pretty interesting.
[02:44:02.083 --> 02:44:03.083]  Go ahead, go ahead Joe.
[02:44:03.283 --> 02:44:05.904]  Donald Trump just released a statement about the experience.
[02:44:07.185 --> 02:44:14.147]  I would like to thank the US Secret Service and the law enforcement resources in Reno and the state of Nevada for their fast professional response.
[02:44:14.547 --> 02:44:18.708]  Also want to thank the many thousands of people present to their unwavering unbelievable support.
[02:44:19.149 --> 02:44:20.249]  Nothing will stop us.
[02:44:20.409 --> 02:44:21.990]  We will make America great again.
[02:44:22.010 --> 02:44:22.910]  That's pretty powerful.
[02:44:23.590 --> 02:44:25.151]  I mean, this was a powerful event.
[02:44:54.131 --> 02:44:55.472]  See how we control the narrative now.
[02:44:55.532 --> 02:44:56.873]  We dominate the media.
[02:44:57.153 --> 02:44:59.095]  Citizen journalists take everything over.
[02:44:59.315 --> 02:45:02.077]  We are far more superior now as human beings.
[02:45:02.237 --> 02:45:07.261]  Our voice as citizens blows away anything Fox News, CNN, anybody does.
[02:45:07.602 --> 02:45:08.843]  Look at what Infowars is doing.
[02:45:09.103 --> 02:45:09.944]  Wikipedia.
[02:45:10.284 --> 02:45:11.425]  Project Veritas.
[02:45:11.705 --> 02:45:17.770]  Just people on the ground at all these events giving us film, video, footage, their opinions, talking about what they're seeing.
[02:45:18.030 --> 02:45:18.811]  We are killing it!
[02:45:19.551 --> 02:45:20.893]  That's Joe Biggs and
[02:45:22.051 --> 02:45:29.997]  I guarantee you, folks, if InfoWars, if this broadcast was on television right now, it would kick ass in the ratings.
[02:45:30.057 --> 02:45:32.799]  It wouldn't even be close, just like Hannity did in the most recent releases.
[02:45:32.819 --> 02:45:34.120]  We would win so much.
[02:45:34.140 --> 02:45:35.501]  We would be sick and tired of winning.
[02:45:35.521 --> 02:45:36.502]  We would be sick and tired.
[02:45:36.622 --> 02:45:40.405]  But I mean, look, you've already put your life on the line for these freedoms.
[02:45:40.425 --> 02:45:42.887]  You've already put your life on the line.
[02:45:43.648 --> 02:45:45.809]  If the establishment or these
[02:45:46.750 --> 02:46:01.967]  Whoever they are, who's ever trying to take this country down folks, George Soros included, if they think they're gonna just get away with this, if they don't think that people are gonna be willing to stand up, I don't care how dumbed down you have the masses with your fluoride in the water, with your dumbed down media.
[02:46:02.668 --> 02:46:06.011]  You're not going, just like Donald Trump says, nothing can stop this.
[02:46:06.471 --> 02:46:07.392]  This is inevitable.
[02:46:08.013 --> 02:46:10.595]  This is an idea whose time has come.
[02:46:10.755 --> 02:46:11.916]  It's a common sense idea.
[02:46:12.216 --> 02:46:20.444]  Get these corrupt criminals out of my government that steal my money and then use it to start fake wars all around the world, folks.
[02:46:21.004 --> 02:46:22.806]  And they also have a satanic occult
[02:46:23.406 --> 02:46:24.807]  Ritual that they like to do as well.
[02:46:24.847 --> 02:46:27.429]  Here's again footage of Donald Trump being rushed off the stage.
[02:46:27.889 --> 02:46:31.812]  An absolute madman for this country goes back on the stage.
[02:46:31.972 --> 02:46:33.973]  And you know, here's the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary.
[02:46:34.033 --> 02:46:35.254]  As you pointed out earlier, Joe.
[02:46:36.195 --> 02:46:37.616]  What would Hillary Clinton have done?
[02:46:37.956 --> 02:46:39.276]  She would be gone.
[02:46:39.697 --> 02:46:40.837]  She would be done.
[02:46:40.917 --> 02:46:43.138]  My buddy said that it rained at her event earlier today.
[02:46:43.158 --> 02:46:44.299]  She had to get off the stage.
[02:46:44.319 --> 02:46:45.139]  She was melting.
[02:46:45.179 --> 02:46:50.842]  So it rained, she left, Donald Trump is almost potentially assassinated.
[02:46:50.882 --> 02:46:51.282]  Comes back.
[02:46:51.342 --> 02:46:55.844]  And he comes back and then writes a statement going, hey I want to thank our Secret Service, our law enforcement.
[02:46:56.144 --> 02:46:57.645]  We're going to make America great again.
[02:46:57.665 --> 02:46:58.645]  You can't stop us.
[02:46:59.186 --> 02:47:02.107]  Like that is the most amazing thing ever.
[02:47:03.387 --> 02:47:04.448]  Like this isn't...
[02:47:09.889 --> 02:47:11.050]  Sorry Joe, I had to get that out.
[02:47:13.231 --> 02:47:15.212]  I did some yelling earlier, so it's all out of me right now.
[02:47:15.232 --> 02:47:16.352]  Alright, let's take another call.
[02:47:16.672 --> 02:47:20.855]  In fact, we've actually got clips from that Hillary Clinton rally that Joe just talked about.
[02:47:21.095 --> 02:47:24.597]  If you guys want to get those ready while we take this next caller, we'll go to those clips.
[02:47:24.637 --> 02:47:26.337]  I think there were some monkeys flying around too, right?
[02:47:26.497 --> 02:47:30.800]  Well, there were the monkeys, so we'll take one more caller and then we'll go to those clips.
[02:47:30.840 --> 02:47:34.522]  Let's go to Terry in Minnesota who wants to talk to Joe.
[02:47:34.602 --> 02:47:35.222]  Go ahead, Terry.
[02:47:36.683 --> 02:47:37.623]  Hey Ron, how you doing?
[02:47:37.663 --> 02:47:39.044]  Hey Joe, I got a question for you.
[02:47:39.940 --> 02:47:40.640]  How's everybody doing?
[02:47:41.861 --> 02:47:42.262]  Pretty good.
[02:47:42.302 --> 02:47:51.508]  Listen, uh, there's a combat wounded combat vet, uh, who had the largest non-denominational church in the world called the Shepherd's Chapel.
[02:47:51.808 --> 02:47:52.649]  Alex knows about it.
[02:47:53.429 --> 02:47:54.850]  I wonder if you ever gone there.
[02:47:55.030 --> 02:47:58.813]  He's got, um, uh, like I said, he was, uh, he was at the Chosin Reservoir.
[02:47:58.833 --> 02:48:00.514]  He was one of the guys that was wounded, came home.
[02:48:00.534 --> 02:48:01.394]  He's from Oklahoma.
[02:48:02.515 --> 02:48:03.976]  His name is Dr. Arnold Murray.
[02:48:04.737 --> 02:48:06.578]  Um, and if you ever, uh,
[02:48:07.128 --> 02:48:22.752]  You know, what you guys have been teaching, and Alex has been talking about for 20 years, especially in the last several, with the New World Order and everything else, this sergeant, this combat wounded vet, has been preaching verbatim, basically, for 65 years.
[02:48:23.112 --> 02:48:30.533]  And he's got tens of thousands of retired and military, also police, and everybody else.
[02:48:33.843 --> 02:48:35.504]  I'm really surprised you guys haven't heard about it.
[02:48:35.564 --> 02:48:44.127]  I told Alex when I first listened to you guys, because I used to be a Rush listener, and I found Alex and you guys in January, and I told him about this church.
[02:48:44.167 --> 02:48:55.332]  I said, it is the max sinful war of churches, where they don't pass the plate, they never have, and they teach the Word chapter by chapter and verse by verse.
[02:48:55.452 --> 02:48:58.133]  And I gave an example to Alex not that long ago.
[02:49:00.191 --> 02:49:08.338]  The book he uses, the Bible he uses, is basically the standard King James, but it's scholar's notes on the side column and not opinions.
[02:49:08.638 --> 02:49:19.347]  And I read an excerpt out of the 13th chapter of Revelation which identifies Isis, and the scholar that put these notes in this Bible died in 1913.
[02:49:21.246 --> 02:49:23.607]  Well, it's crazy how accurate the Bible is.
[02:49:23.627 --> 02:49:35.630]  Whether you believe it or not, the accuracy of the Bible is, especially Revelation, as you're pointing out, there can be so many comparisons made, not just geographically, but politically as well.
[02:49:36.351 --> 02:49:37.431]  So that's wild stuff.
[02:49:37.451 --> 02:49:38.611]  What was the name of that pastor again?
[02:49:39.572 --> 02:49:44.873]  Well, his name is Dr. Arnold Murray, but the church is the Shepherd's Chapel, and I talked to Rob Dewyer.
[02:49:45.413 --> 02:49:47.774]  He let me ramble for like five minutes about a week ago.
[02:49:47.794 --> 02:49:49.795]  He didn't like it that I rambled so much.
[02:49:51.514 --> 02:49:53.795]  I was just talking about the New World Order.
[02:49:53.955 --> 02:49:58.617]  If you understand, we're going into the New World Order.
[02:49:58.957 --> 02:50:00.077]  We can't stop.
[02:50:00.418 --> 02:50:01.598]  You know what I mean?
[02:50:02.158 --> 02:50:03.359]  We're in the New World Order.
[02:50:03.539 --> 02:50:05.220]  Their next phase is to eliminate us.
[02:50:07.890 --> 02:50:08.691]  Sorry, folks!
[02:50:09.291 --> 02:50:11.834]  Sorry to just shove the red pill down your throat like that.
[02:50:12.254 --> 02:50:20.021]  Alright, thank you so much for the call, Terry, and we'll look into that Shepherd's Church that you talked about, and maybe we can even get that guy on.
[02:50:20.301 --> 02:50:21.582]  I don't know, Joe, have you heard of that before?
[02:50:21.682 --> 02:50:21.902]  No.
[02:50:22.543 --> 02:50:25.526]  So yeah, maybe that's something, maybe that's somebody we'd be interested in getting on.
[02:50:25.806 --> 02:50:28.268]  Alright, so you guys got these clips ready from the Hillary speech?
[02:50:29.349 --> 02:50:30.390]  So here's the deal, folks.
[02:50:30.410 --> 02:50:33.953]  Hillary spoke earlier today in Florida, and
[02:50:35.188 --> 02:50:38.609]  Yesterday we had Barack Obama freaking out at a campaign event.
[02:50:38.729 --> 02:50:39.489]  Freaking out.
[02:50:39.509 --> 02:50:44.670]  I mean, he's made a jackass of himself multiple times trying to attack Trump.
[02:50:44.710 --> 02:50:49.371]  The ultimate jackass moment was Barack Obama yesterday freaking out, scolding the audience.
[02:50:49.511 --> 02:50:56.453]  Scolding the audience, acting like he was their father, banging on the podium like he's some sort of a judge with a gavel.
[02:50:57.353 --> 02:50:59.874]  Truly, Obama was triggered, if you want to go there.
[02:51:00.375 --> 02:51:01.395]  So that was a meltdown.
[02:51:01.515 --> 02:51:04.117]  And then today, a literal meltdown.
[02:51:04.497 --> 02:51:11.040]  Hillary Clinton, speaking in the rain, had to get off the stage before she melted like the Wicked Witch of the West.
[02:51:11.120 --> 02:51:14.462]  Secret Service ushers her away as raindrops fall upon her little face.
[02:51:14.702 --> 02:51:15.823]  Yes.
[02:51:16.163 --> 02:51:21.005]  Yeah, and so here are some important clips from the Clinton rally today.
[02:51:21.045 --> 02:51:22.546]  We're going to tear her a new one.
[02:51:22.846 --> 02:51:23.807]  Let's roll to the first one.
[02:51:25.137 --> 02:51:27.558]  We've got a bunch of great folks here with me.
[02:51:27.578 --> 02:51:33.999]  I want to have stand up and I hope that you will send him to work with me in the Senate.
[02:51:34.259 --> 02:51:35.059]  No, just wait, just wait.
[02:51:35.139 --> 02:51:36.459]  Congressman Patrick Murphy!
[02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:39.140]  So here's the deal, folks.
[02:51:40.420 --> 02:51:46.021]  She, every time she does a speech, she mentions who she wants to put in office.
[02:51:46.161 --> 02:51:47.142]  She's done this every time.
[02:51:47.202 --> 02:51:48.922]  So I'm just going to give you a little hint.
[02:51:49.682 --> 02:51:57.388]  If Hillary Clinton is endorsing a candidate for your local government, you want to stay away from that candidate.
[02:51:57.448 --> 02:51:59.790]  You want to avoid that candidate like the plague.
[02:52:00.070 --> 02:52:07.416]  So I thank Hillary Clinton for going out and campaigning and mentioning all the corrupt shills that will work with her.
[02:52:07.917 --> 02:52:13.301]  So thank you for telling us who to avoid at every speech that you go to, Hillary.
[02:52:13.361 --> 02:52:17.985]  So again, whoever Hillary endorses for your local government, you want to vote in the other guy.
[02:52:18.165 --> 02:52:19.046]  Let's roll to the next one.
[02:52:20.131 --> 02:52:23.432]  Saturday before election day really gets me geared up.
[02:52:25.653 --> 02:52:33.175]  We are seeing tremendous momentum, large numbers of people turning out, breaking records in a lot of places.
[02:52:34.615 --> 02:52:37.376]  Now of course, this is all because of Trump.
[02:52:38.156 --> 02:52:40.157]  This has nothing to do with Hillary Clinton.
[02:52:41.326 --> 02:52:44.290]  Bernie Sanders had more people show up than Hillary Clinton did.
[02:52:44.630 --> 02:52:48.836]  Hillary Clinton has run for office before, and there was none of this excitement.
[02:52:49.136 --> 02:52:51.139]  Why, all of a sudden, are records being broken?
[02:52:51.239 --> 02:52:52.801]  Why, all of a sudden, is voter turnout up?
[02:52:52.901 --> 02:52:55.324]  Why, all of a sudden, all this excitement over the presidential election?
[02:52:55.965 --> 02:52:57.306]  Donald Trump!
[02:52:58.901 --> 02:53:00.061]  Understand that, Hillary.
[02:53:00.542 --> 02:53:16.793]  But see, she knows her constituents are so stupid, and we know they feel this way from the WikiLeaks emails, that she can sit here and pretend like all this excitement, all this momentum is because of her campaign when she's cancelling events because nobody shows up.
[02:53:17.133 --> 02:53:21.596]  Tim Kaine, you could count the number of people that show up to a Tim Kaine event on one hand,
[02:53:22.817 --> 02:53:36.165]  And again, she has to bring out Beyonce or Jay-Z or Katy Perry or Miley Cyrus to try to drum up support from the brainwashed masses, to try to drum up support from the ignorant sheeple, to try to drum up excitement.
[02:53:36.585 --> 02:53:37.626]  It's totally faux.
[02:53:38.246 --> 02:53:39.207]  It's totally fake.
[02:53:39.607 --> 02:53:41.388]  None of this excitement is over Hillary Clinton.
[02:53:41.888 --> 02:53:43.389]  It's clearly over Donald Trump.
[02:53:43.709 --> 02:53:44.470]  But as usual,
[02:53:45.330 --> 02:53:47.293]  They try to steal everything we do.
[02:53:47.333 --> 02:53:48.655]  They try to take our momentum.
[02:53:48.675 --> 02:53:50.117]  They try to harness it for themselves.
[02:53:50.377 --> 02:53:51.459]  They want to steal everything.
[02:53:51.619 --> 02:53:52.520]  They're just a bunch of thieves.
[02:53:52.560 --> 02:53:53.381]  Let's roll to the next one.
[02:53:53.401 --> 02:54:01.552]  Now, just in case you didn't notice last night, I gotta say, I was with Jay-Z and Beyonce.
[02:54:07.247 --> 02:54:07.427]  Wow.
[02:54:07.827 --> 02:54:08.508]  Who cares?
[02:54:09.048 --> 02:54:10.008]  Congratulations!
[02:54:10.349 --> 02:54:26.397]  You're with a rapper and his rapper wife that sing about breaking the law, dealing drugs, soliciting prostitution, objectifying women, and then you're going to campaign and say that Donald Trump is the bad immoral candidate because of the way he treats women.
[02:54:26.997 --> 02:54:31.320]  This is hypocrisy right in front of the constituent's face.
[02:54:32.220 --> 02:54:33.901]  Right in front of her voter's face.
[02:54:34.101 --> 02:54:34.982]  She could lit... This is...
[02:54:38.024 --> 02:54:38.284]  Okay.
[02:54:39.705 --> 02:54:44.227]  The elections cannot be rigged, but the Russians are rigging them.
[02:54:44.908 --> 02:54:48.030]  You cannot vote Donald Trump in because he objectifies women.
[02:54:48.530 --> 02:54:49.370]  Here's Jay-Z.
[02:54:49.851 --> 02:54:50.871]  Here's Miley Cyrus.
[02:54:55.654 --> 02:54:56.754]  I don't have anything else to say on that.
[02:54:56.774 --> 02:54:57.555]  Let's roll the next one.
[02:54:58.633 --> 02:55:12.982]  I spent four and a half hours standing next to Donald Trump on that stage, proving once and for all that I have the stamina to be President of the United States.
[02:55:13.383 --> 02:55:15.204]  I'm not really sure if that makes any sense.
[02:55:15.884 --> 02:55:18.886]  Ooh, you stood on a stage for four and a half hours.
[02:55:19.587 --> 02:55:22.168]  Ooh, wow, you've really got a lot of energy, don't you?
[02:55:22.969 --> 02:55:26.071]  That was, I mean, again, they tried to take
[02:55:28.467 --> 02:55:31.068]  Something that is true for the other candidate.
[02:55:31.128 --> 02:55:32.729]  Donald Trump is the one with the stamina.
[02:55:32.769 --> 02:55:34.269]  Donald Trump is the one with the energy.
[02:55:34.589 --> 02:55:38.431]  Donald Trump has probably given... You know, I'd like to actually see someone tabulate this.
[02:55:39.111 --> 02:55:42.492]  How many rally speeches has Donald Trump given compared to Hillary Clinton?
[02:55:43.332 --> 02:55:48.975]  I would guess Donald Trump, when it's all said and done, beats Hillary Clinton by three times.
[02:55:49.775 --> 02:55:50.055]  Okay?
[02:55:51.756 --> 02:55:55.457]  But she gets up here and says she's the high-energy candidate.
[02:55:57.435 --> 02:55:58.255]  Let's roll to the next one.
[02:55:58.655 --> 02:55:59.796]  This woman is such a hypocrite.
[02:55:59.836 --> 02:56:01.116]  It's unbelievable.
[02:56:01.136 --> 02:56:01.416]  Go ahead.
[02:56:02.457 --> 02:56:06.938]  Now, you know, he kept saying things like, well, what have you done for 30 years?
[02:56:07.078 --> 02:56:10.580]  And I'm thinking to myself, Donald, you don't want to go there.
[02:56:13.521 --> 02:56:19.803]  I mean, I would have been happy to spend all four and a half hours talking about what I did compared to what he's done for the last 30 years.
[02:56:19.943 --> 02:56:21.543]  Well, then why didn't you?
[02:56:23.104 --> 02:56:24.184]  Then why didn't you, Hillary?
[02:56:24.684 --> 02:56:25.885]  Why don't you do it at your rally?
[02:56:26.957 --> 02:56:28.379]  You've got all these accomplishments!
[02:56:28.580 --> 02:56:30.964]  And by the way, folks, we just, we clipped that off, obviously.
[02:56:31.004 --> 02:56:31.965]  She didn't mention one.
[02:56:32.947 --> 02:56:33.207]  Okay?
[02:56:34.169 --> 02:56:38.396]  She pats herself on the head because she's been in government for 30 years.
[02:56:40.300 --> 02:56:42.663]  And by the way, Donald Trump does want to go there.
[02:56:42.763 --> 02:56:44.465]  That's why he continues to go there.
[02:56:44.866 --> 02:56:48.330]  Because that's the ultimate, that is the ultimate punch to your mouth.
[02:56:49.251 --> 02:56:51.273]  Is that you are the one that's been in government.
[02:56:51.373 --> 02:56:52.975]  Everybody knows the government's corrupt.
[02:56:53.556 --> 02:56:57.461]  Look at, if you ask the average citizen, they'll tell you the government is corrupt.
[02:56:57.781 --> 02:56:59.143]  Hillary Clinton's been in the government.
[02:57:00.526 --> 02:57:02.227]  So yeah, we do want to go there.
[02:57:02.607 --> 02:57:10.333]  But again, you just mentioned how you were on the stage with Trump for four and a half hours, and he keeps wanting to demonize you about your time in office.
[02:57:10.833 --> 02:57:12.654]  Well, why didn't you clarify how great it was?
[02:57:12.735 --> 02:57:14.616]  Why didn't you mention all those accomplishments?
[02:57:14.856 --> 02:57:15.857]  Because there are none.
[02:57:16.597 --> 02:57:24.143]  But her voters, her constituents, the people at this rally, are so small-minded, so brainwashed, that they can't even see through this.
[02:57:24.183 --> 02:57:26.964]  Now, this next one, folks, will really
[02:57:27.927 --> 02:57:29.089]  Really piss you off.
[02:57:29.250 --> 02:57:30.492]  Let's go ahead and roll it.
[02:57:30.512 --> 02:57:30.912]  Go ahead Joe.
[02:57:30.993 --> 02:57:34.399]  I guarantee you at the end of the day we're going to end up finding emails or something.
[02:57:34.539 --> 02:57:36.482]  A lot of these people are going to be paid to go to this.
[02:57:37.469 --> 02:57:38.310]  Oh, oh, for sure.
[02:57:38.330 --> 02:57:40.712]  Tons of people have been paid to go to these stupid events.
[02:57:41.252 --> 02:57:42.433]  Like, have you been to one yet?
[02:57:42.473 --> 02:57:46.997]  Like, I've actually had to sit through a couple of her rallies before, and it's mind-numbing.
[02:57:47.457 --> 02:57:50.460]  It is literally one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life.
[02:57:51.040 --> 02:58:02.249]  Sitting through 30 minutes of her speaking is far more traumatic than 10 years of military service, four years in combat, being shelled, shot at.
[02:58:03.130 --> 02:58:03.891]  That was horrible.
[02:58:03.951 --> 02:58:06.012]  I thought I could never compare that to anything.
[02:58:06.392 --> 02:58:11.156]  And sitting there and listening to this woman ramble on, lie after lie after lie.
[02:58:11.636 --> 02:58:15.799]  It is the most traumatic event one person can go through.
[02:58:16.079 --> 02:58:19.201]  So I don't believe people can actually just go, hey, you know what today?
[02:58:19.582 --> 02:58:20.602]  What's going on today?
[02:58:20.642 --> 02:58:22.864]  Let's Google what's happening in our area.
[02:58:22.944 --> 02:58:24.125]  Oh, there's a Hillary Clinton rally.
[02:58:24.485 --> 02:58:25.305]  That'd be fun.
[02:58:25.326 --> 02:58:30.789]  That's probably better than going to watch a movie or seeing Metallica in concert or something like that or going to watch the Cubs play.
[02:58:31.129 --> 02:58:32.390]  You know, yeah, let's go watch Hillary.
[02:58:32.430 --> 02:58:34.871]  No, that's like, no, you've got to be getting paid.
[02:58:35.131 --> 02:58:36.372]  There's something going on there.
[02:58:36.992 --> 02:58:38.113]  So you're telling me right now.
[02:58:39.551 --> 02:58:45.895]  That it was more traumatic for you to stare at the spawn of Satan than to actually go to war.
[02:58:46.315 --> 02:58:46.575]  Yes.
[02:58:47.436 --> 02:58:49.297]  I literally would sign back up.
[02:58:49.737 --> 02:58:55.741]  I would go into Mosul right now and fight ISIS before I ever have to go to a Hillary Clinton rally ever again.
[02:58:56.261 --> 02:59:01.123]  I'll always remember, I don't know what rally it was, at the end of the last Hillary Clinton rally.
[02:59:01.263 --> 02:59:02.544]  First of all, you can hear her voice.
[02:59:02.684 --> 02:59:04.625]  She sits here and talks about all this energy she has.
[02:59:05.325 --> 02:59:06.426]  Can you hear her voice, folks?
[02:59:06.726 --> 02:59:10.307]  She sounds like Alex Jones, who's been bullhorning the globalists for 40 years.
[02:59:10.628 --> 02:59:13.329]  She has... You gotta get out and vote!
[02:59:13.389 --> 02:59:15.610]  I've got all this energy, all this stamina!
[02:59:16.360 --> 02:59:17.580]  She sounds like a hack.
[02:59:17.720 --> 02:59:19.241]  It's miserable.
[02:59:19.381 --> 02:59:22.762]  She's got so much drugs coursing through her veins.
[02:59:23.122 --> 02:59:26.583]  It reminds me of that drag off guy, whatever his name is, from Rocky.
[02:59:26.963 --> 02:59:29.543]  The guy, Draco.
[02:59:29.623 --> 02:59:33.505]  He's sitting there on the treadmill and they're pumping him full of stuff to keep him going.
[02:59:33.865 --> 02:59:37.826]  He's transforming into this new being or whatever.
[02:59:37.946 --> 02:59:38.746]  But that's exactly it!
[02:59:39.286 --> 02:59:44.009]  She's got her blacked-out, you know, ambulance-van thing that she's got there.
[02:59:44.029 --> 02:59:44.929]  See, and that's exactly it.
[02:59:45.309 --> 02:59:51.613]  If a gunman showed up at a Hillary Clinton rally, she would be rushed off the stage, and it wouldn't just be that she's not coming back.
[02:59:52.293 --> 02:59:53.734]  She doesn't have control.
[02:59:53.814 --> 02:59:55.295]  She doesn't make that decision.
[02:59:55.395 --> 02:59:56.175]  Think about this.
[02:59:56.455 --> 03:00:00.798]  Think about a Hillary Clinton schedule, a day-to-day schedule for her now.
[03:00:01.258 --> 03:00:03.499]  Think about what a schedule is as a president.
[03:00:03.539 --> 03:00:05.640]  You saw how quickly Obama aged.
[03:00:06.421 --> 03:00:07.301]  The lack of sleep.
[03:00:07.361 --> 03:00:08.342]  He talks about it.
[03:00:08.722 --> 03:00:09.623]  Think about this.
[03:00:10.023 --> 03:00:17.788]  She can barely handle three pressers, three 15-minute speeches every few days, and that is killing her.
[03:00:18.288 --> 03:00:21.810]  That is literally to a point where people have to help her up on stage.
[03:00:22.171 --> 03:00:26.473]  How is she going to be fit enough to run this country 24-7?
[03:00:26.573 --> 03:00:28.775]  She will not answer that 3 a.m.
[03:00:28.835 --> 03:00:29.835]  call.
[03:00:29.955 --> 03:00:30.896]  More people will die.
[03:00:31.196 --> 03:00:32.477]  More Americans are going to be left.
[03:00:32.857 --> 03:00:33.938]  It's just going to be horrible.
[03:00:34.915 --> 03:00:35.875]  I'm getting this number.
[03:00:35.895 --> 03:00:39.716]  This is a number from the Gateway Pundit.
[03:00:40.497 --> 03:00:51.780]  Since the conventions, since the nominees were made official, here you go folks, Donald Trump has had 300, almost about 334,000 at his conventions.
[03:00:51.860 --> 03:00:53.721]  Hillary has had 14,000.
[03:00:53.821 --> 03:00:59.462]  So Hillary Clinton is getting beat by over 300,000 on rally turnout.
[03:00:59.502 --> 03:01:01.243]  And I was talking about this earlier with Alex.
[03:01:01.843 --> 03:01:04.187]  You know, what are my indicators for who's going to win?
[03:01:04.648 --> 03:01:07.293]  Obviously, we're dealing with rigged voting machines.
[03:01:07.333 --> 03:01:08.595]  I think that's been made clear now.
[03:01:08.715 --> 03:01:10.999]  But, I mean, folks, come on.
[03:01:12.041 --> 03:01:14.666]  How can Hillary possibly get voters to turn out?
[03:01:15.560 --> 03:01:17.301]  When she can't even get him to show up at a rally.
[03:01:17.341 --> 03:01:24.126]  And then Joe Biggs is sitting here explaining how he would rather go fight terrorists than have to stare at the spawn of Satan again.
[03:01:24.146 --> 03:01:25.006]  Hillary Clinton.
[03:01:25.167 --> 03:01:29.890]  I mean, I literally would rather throw myself back into combat.
[03:01:29.910 --> 03:01:30.971]  I mean, I'm out of shape now.
[03:01:31.391 --> 03:01:31.931]  And here's why.
[03:01:32.271 --> 03:01:32.912]  And this is why.
[03:01:33.112 --> 03:01:36.574]  But I would rather do that than be around her because she's so pure evil.
[03:01:36.614 --> 03:01:38.996]  I mean, she's just a disgusting excuse for a human being.
[03:01:39.096 --> 03:01:41.898]  And this next clip is exactly why.
[03:01:42.038 --> 03:01:43.179]  Go ahead and roll the next one.
[03:01:44.036 --> 03:01:53.901]  As your Secretary of State, I traveled to 112 countries, I've stood up for human rights, women's rights, worker rights, and LGBT rights!
[03:01:54.461 --> 03:01:56.943]  This is why we cannot stand Hillary Clinton.
[03:01:56.963 --> 03:02:02.426]  This is why Joe Biggs would rather fight a terrorist in hand-to-hand combat than watch Hillary Clinton.
[03:02:02.726 --> 03:02:09.129]  She just said that her time in the State Department, she stood up for women and LGBT rights.
[03:02:09.629 --> 03:02:10.350]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[03:02:11.150 --> 03:02:21.684]  It has been exposed that Hillary Clinton used the State Department to use her leverage politically to gain donors to the Clinton Foundation.
[03:02:22.024 --> 03:02:25.008]  And again, do you know where these donors are?
[03:02:26.004 --> 03:02:34.646]  Countries in the Middle East that don't have women's rights, countries in the Middle East, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, that behead gay people.
[03:02:35.166 --> 03:02:55.610]  And she has the audacity, she has the unmitigated nerve to come up here and tell you she's the candidate standing up for women's rights, she's the candidate standing up for gay rights, when she's the candidate that has been funded by the very countries, the final countries on this earth, that don't give women rights and don't give gay people rights.
[03:02:55.970 --> 03:02:57.612]  This is the ultimate hypocrisy.
[03:02:57.672 --> 03:02:59.213]  This woman is the ultimate liar.
[03:02:59.613 --> 03:03:01.435]  How can you vote for this witch?
[03:03:02.516 --> 03:03:04.979]  I mean, at the end of the day, you know, what is that saying?
[03:03:05.339 --> 03:03:10.684]  The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world it didn't exist.
[03:03:11.585 --> 03:03:16.950]  The greatest trick Hillary Clinton's ever done is convince people she's a worthy candidate.
[03:03:18.018 --> 03:03:31.268]  You know, at the same time I hate her, I'm disgusted by her, but at the same time you almost have to, you kind of have to have a level of respect in a sense because somehow this woman is able to sit here on stage every day.
[03:03:31.348 --> 03:03:38.553]  She knows that everything coming out of her mouth is a lie, that everything she does, every fiber of her being is woven around corruption.
[03:03:38.853 --> 03:03:44.177]  Everybody she, you know, keeps around herself and you can tell you can judge someone by the people they keep around them.
[03:03:44.557 --> 03:03:59.948]  Look at the people in her corner, John Podesta, his brothers who have, you know, sex posters of teenage kids and spirit cooking and these rituals and, you know, the corruption and she's friends with Laura Silsby who's actually been kidnapping children in Haiti.
[03:04:00.429 --> 03:04:04.272]  These are the kind of people she keeps around her and everyone knows.
[03:04:05.412 --> 03:04:09.956]  So should we be mad at Hillary Clinton or should we be mad at all of these morons?
[03:04:11.825 --> 03:04:13.446]  Like, I just don't get it.
[03:04:13.486 --> 03:04:25.496]  Like, if I explain to you just the worst possible traits ever to a human being, and I ask the person, like, do you think that's a, like, these are good traits for someone, you know, or is this someone you sound like you could trust?
[03:04:25.976 --> 03:04:26.837]  They would say no.
[03:04:27.257 --> 03:04:39.647]  But if you put Hillary Clinton on it, and then you put those same traits of just the most evil, corrupt, untrustworthy, backstabbing, lying, corrupt, you know, filth, for some reason it just becomes okay now.
[03:04:39.687 --> 03:04:40.087]  Like, so,
[03:04:40.988 --> 03:04:42.429]  How has she been able to pull off?
[03:04:42.449 --> 03:04:44.430]  This is like the biggest trick ever.
[03:04:44.450 --> 03:04:47.813]  It's literally like a magic trick.
[03:04:47.833 --> 03:04:52.796]  Like she's somehow like waved a wand and has been able to just put everybody in a trance.
[03:04:53.116 --> 03:04:53.977]  I don't understand it.
[03:04:54.940 --> 03:04:56.061]  It's been going on for a while.
[03:04:56.081 --> 03:04:56.781]  It baffles me.
[03:04:58.663 --> 03:05:06.109]  Donald Trump is accurate when he says that the media is the main reason why Hillary is even in the position she's in right now.
[03:05:06.309 --> 03:05:11.954]  A fake candidate, a dead corpse, a rotted husk that they still pretend is a presidential candidate.
[03:05:12.214 --> 03:05:13.215]  Let's go to the final clip.
[03:05:13.235 --> 03:05:14.356]  Hillary going full demon.
[03:05:16.442 --> 03:05:20.906]  Now my friends, you are a hearty bunch standing out here in the rain.
[03:05:21.306 --> 03:05:25.850]  I don't think I need to tell you all the wrong things about Donald Trump.
[03:05:25.890 --> 03:05:28.392]  But here's what I want you to remember.
[03:05:28.412 --> 03:05:31.895]  I want to be the president for everybody.
[03:05:31.975 --> 03:05:43.946]  Everybody who agrees with me, people who don't agree with me, people who vote for me, people who don't vote for me.
[03:05:48.106 --> 03:05:50.567]  All she's missing right now is a freaking broom.
[03:05:50.587 --> 03:05:53.088]  Was that Emperor Palpatine?
[03:05:53.108 --> 03:05:57.370]  Hey, can we get an image of Emperor Palpatine up real quick, please?
[03:05:57.410 --> 03:05:58.831]  Can I get an Emperor Palpatine?
[03:05:59.691 --> 03:06:01.252]  Actually, the crew is so great.
[03:06:01.272 --> 03:06:04.533]  Thank you guys for coming in here tonight and staying up late with us.
[03:06:04.633 --> 03:06:05.514]  Can we get a shot?
[03:06:05.954 --> 03:06:14.823]  While I take this caller, can you guys work on getting a side-by-side of Emperor Palpatine and then Hillary Clinton with the disgusting looking wrinkled face?
[03:06:14.863 --> 03:06:15.103]  Yes.
[03:06:15.563 --> 03:06:17.545]  And then the Hillary Clinton face right next to that.
[03:06:17.605 --> 03:06:20.188]  I know you guys know the image that I'm talking about.
[03:06:21.028 --> 03:06:23.671]  If you guys could make that happen while we take this next caller.
[03:06:23.791 --> 03:06:25.533]  I'm trying to get my buddy to call in.
[03:06:25.733 --> 03:06:28.396]  He's a really big guy on Facebook, Outlaw Morgan.
[03:06:29.016 --> 03:06:30.997]  Does a lot of constitutional videos, all that.
[03:06:31.017 --> 03:06:32.018]  I'm trying to get him to call in.
[03:06:32.358 --> 03:06:35.120]  This guy, if we can get him on here, has got great things to say.
[03:06:35.180 --> 03:06:37.462]  I was actually able to speak with him up in D.C.
[03:06:37.542 --> 03:06:43.346]  last weekend with a whole lot of other people that are surrogates for Trump, Pastor Mark Burns and all that.
[03:06:44.146 --> 03:06:45.067]  So hopefully he calls in.
[03:06:45.087 --> 03:06:45.567]  There it is.
[03:06:46.047 --> 03:06:47.088]  It's going to be pretty.
[03:06:48.953 --> 03:06:50.554]  They look the exact same.
[03:06:50.614 --> 03:06:51.874]  Dude, we should Photoshop that.
[03:06:51.894 --> 03:06:56.376]  We need to take that black little hoodie off of him and put it on her and it would be identical.
[03:06:56.576 --> 03:06:57.076]  Yes.
[03:06:58.256 --> 03:07:00.277]  Feel the power of the dark side.
[03:07:01.097 --> 03:07:01.877]  Yes.
[03:07:03.478 --> 03:07:06.379]  Alright, let's go to Lee in West Virginia.
[03:07:06.439 --> 03:07:07.779]  Again, phone lines are open.
[03:07:07.799 --> 03:07:09.600]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[03:07:09.660 --> 03:07:10.320]  Please support us.
[03:07:10.380 --> 03:07:11.561]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:07:11.801 --> 03:07:12.601]  Let's go out to Lee.
[03:07:13.581 --> 03:07:15.722]  Hey, I have three things to mention to you guys.
[03:07:16.082 --> 03:07:17.983]  I'm a former K-9 handler.
[03:07:18.755 --> 03:07:21.798]  Bombdog explosive train for Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
[03:07:21.818 --> 03:07:26.221]  So I was assigned to Air Force One for a full tour of duty.
[03:07:26.481 --> 03:07:28.463]  I was stationed at Andrews Air Force Base.
[03:07:29.164 --> 03:07:31.906]  And I've been on the campaign trail with George Bush.
[03:07:33.127 --> 03:07:43.896]  Our canine, when we went into a situation, you know, we completely searched everything that came in, in regards to the president, the vice president, our dignitary like that.
[03:07:44.873 --> 03:08:10.704]  And so the level of security that's now implemented, my boys went to the rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania yesterday, and they had to go through, initially they went through two levels of security, and then they were in the VIP section, so they went through a third level of security, and my oldest son's Texas belt buckle was even inspected by security.
[03:08:11.423 --> 03:08:25.051]  So what I'm trying to tell you is that a breach of security is either willful neglect by someone that needs to be identified and or it's an inside job and it's absolutely complicit.
[03:08:25.752 --> 03:08:27.953]  So there's two other things I need to mention to you.
[03:08:28.293 --> 03:08:29.894]  Or there was never a gun, I guess.
[03:08:30.034 --> 03:08:30.655]  It would be the other.
[03:08:34.006 --> 03:08:43.671]  You know, once you verify if it was a gun or not... I've got a guy right now who was standing right beside the guy who's on the floor right where it happened.
[03:08:43.691 --> 03:08:45.071]  I'm sending him the telephone number.
[03:08:45.091 --> 03:08:47.172]  He's tweeting out everything that's happening.
[03:08:47.212 --> 03:08:48.733]  So I'm going to try to get this guy to call in.
[03:08:48.753 --> 03:08:50.274]  I'm going to have him give us his name.
[03:08:50.334 --> 03:08:52.235]  So if this guy calls in, let's get him to the front.
[03:08:52.455 --> 03:08:57.198]  Again folks, sorry to interrupt you, but Donald Trump had a rally tonight in Reno.
[03:08:57.998 --> 03:08:59.899]  Secret Service had to rush him off the stage.
[03:08:59.959 --> 03:09:02.979]  It was believed there was a gunman that had to be apprehended.
[03:09:02.999 --> 03:09:04.780]  This broke while we were on air.
[03:09:05.600 --> 03:09:06.480]  Huge breaking news.
[03:09:06.921 --> 03:09:07.701]  Let's go back to Lee.
[03:09:09.401 --> 03:09:11.162]  I need to mention something else to you.
[03:09:11.882 --> 03:09:15.243]  Dr. Eric Porterfield is a blind pastor
[03:09:15.879 --> 03:09:30.384]  Our blind preacher in the state of West Virginia, he has just had all his guns confiscated from him because he privately responded to a video post by Dr. Lori Tucker in West Virginia.
[03:09:31.165 --> 03:09:40.588]  Dr. Tucker then called the authorities, filed a complaint against this blind preacher and his family, and they confiscated all his guns.
[03:09:41.708 --> 03:09:47.294]  He runs an organization called Blonde Faith Ministries, and so maybe you guys can help him out.
[03:09:47.374 --> 03:09:48.995]  That has not made news.
[03:09:50.336 --> 03:10:02.128]  I have the email, which is a very simple explanation that he said, hey look, you should rescind your video about you being pro-choice.
[03:10:05.251 --> 03:10:11.857]  And pro-Hillary, which she did, because she said, I can be pro-life.
[03:10:12.897 --> 03:10:17.261]  She said I could be pro-life personally, but pro-choice politically.
[03:10:17.701 --> 03:10:22.225]  And then Dr. Eric Porterfield's guns have been taken.
[03:10:22.785 --> 03:10:28.230]  Last thing, guys, Isaiah chapter 3, verse 12 of the King James Bible,
[03:10:28.755 --> 03:10:34.557]  Well, I mean, if we were dealing with a woman, that might be the case, but we're dealing with a demon witch.
[03:10:57.079 --> 03:11:03.706]  So if it was a woman running for president, like Jill Stein, who doesn't want World War III, then that's okay with me.
[03:11:03.886 --> 03:11:05.668]  And again, it's not about identity politics.
[03:11:05.708 --> 03:11:06.969]  We don't play identity politics.
[03:11:07.029 --> 03:11:08.250]  Hillary Clinton supporters do.
[03:11:09.191 --> 03:11:12.394]  But, thank you for the call, Lee, and for your intel.
[03:11:13.335 --> 03:11:15.237]  But again, this isn't a woman.
[03:11:15.497 --> 03:11:16.598]  This is a demon.
[03:11:17.446 --> 03:11:20.327]  Okay, and I guess we've got your friend on the line here, Joe?
[03:11:20.347 --> 03:11:23.187]  This is the guy who's there, on the ground, where the thing happened.
[03:11:23.227 --> 03:11:24.408]  Oh, we've got someone who is there?
[03:11:24.428 --> 03:11:26.328]  I was just watching this guy tweet live.
[03:11:26.368 --> 03:11:37.310]  Someone was sending me his tweets, and he said he was standing feet away from where it happened, so I just DM'd him on Twitter the phone number to call in, a direct line for us, so let's go to this guy, his name's Patrick.
[03:11:37.331 --> 03:11:38.911]  Do we have him pulled up, guys?
[03:11:39.781 --> 03:11:49.206]  Okay, we've got Patrick who is an eyewitness at the Reno event, the Trump Rally, where Trump had to be rushed off the stage by Secret Service because there was a gunman believed to be there.
[03:11:49.486 --> 03:11:50.507]  Let's go out to Patrick.
[03:11:52.868 --> 03:11:53.148]  Hello?
[03:11:53.749 --> 03:11:57.651]  Yes, Patrick, share with us your experience at the Trump Rally tonight.
[03:11:57.671 --> 03:11:58.591]  Did you see a gun?
[03:11:59.892 --> 03:12:01.193]  I did not see a gun.
[03:12:01.233 --> 03:12:01.893]  Here's what happened.
[03:12:02.674 --> 03:12:05.996]  I was towards the front of the crowd looking at Trump.
[03:12:06.036 --> 03:12:07.116]  We were all cheering and everything.
[03:12:07.777 --> 03:12:08.457]  There was a man
[03:12:09.309 --> 03:12:17.855]  About 10 feet up and to my right near like the front of the crowd who pulled out a sign that said Republicans against Trump.
[03:12:18.395 --> 03:12:22.078]  The man had like a buzz cut and he had a camo baseball cap on.
[03:12:23.334 --> 03:12:26.697]  He started jumping around and trying to make his way towards the front of the crowd.
[03:12:27.117 --> 03:12:29.880]  And a couple of guys were jumping up, trying to grab his sign from him.
[03:12:30.581 --> 03:12:31.662]  Turned into a scuffle.
[03:12:32.102 --> 03:12:33.203]  They were getting all shoved around.
[03:12:33.223 --> 03:12:35.525]  A couple people tackled him onto the ground.
[03:12:35.545 --> 03:12:37.387]  I was right there.
[03:12:37.407 --> 03:12:38.888]  I was within arm's reach of me.
[03:12:39.168 --> 03:12:40.549]  And someone yelled, he has a gun.
[03:12:41.050 --> 03:12:43.772]  And then all of a sudden, everybody's yelling, oh, he has a gun.
[03:12:44.113 --> 03:12:45.454]  And everybody just scattered.
[03:12:46.641 --> 03:13:16.108]  Okay, so perhaps there wasn't a gun and if your story is correct it may have just been an altercation and then someone I guess thought he had a gun or saw something they thought was a gun and then shouted he was a gun and then of course now he had a gun and I guess if you're Social Security or I'm sorry your Secret Service and you hear gun and of course you're gonna pounce yeah you're gonna rush Donald Trump off the stage so I guess so by your judgment would you say there was or was not a gun there?
[03:13:17.307 --> 03:13:26.156]  I would say that there was not, and I looked on Twitter, a tweet from CNN, which I don't trust CNN at all, but they said that there was no gun found, so I'm just waiting to hear more on that.
[03:13:26.436 --> 03:13:33.062]  Well, that would, I mean, that would make more sense, because if there was a gun there, now all of a sudden we've got a hundred other questions we've got to ask.
[03:13:33.082 --> 03:13:35.545]  Yeah, I know, like, you know, like, what's going on with the security now?
[03:13:35.585 --> 03:13:39.308]  You know, I've been to these events, you know, it's not something easy.
[03:13:39.969 --> 03:13:40.289]  for that
[03:13:56.565 --> 03:14:10.494]  ...run and have security on, you have to have EOD, which is Explosive Ordnance Department technician guys, they come in, you have these Secret Service guys come in, they do bomb sniffing dogs, they look under every seat, they look under every crevice, they go through everything.
[03:14:10.794 --> 03:14:23.983]  The amount of security that goes around securing an event like that before one of these candidates come through is so strict, so tedious, so by the book, just every little thing is looked at,
[03:14:24.503 --> 03:14:24.843]  Search.
[03:14:24.883 --> 03:14:32.510]  So for somebody to get in with a gun, you know, for me, when we first heard that and we saw that, I was just so shocked.
[03:14:32.930 --> 03:14:35.152]  My first thing is, who the hell's paid off?
[03:14:35.192 --> 03:14:37.134]  Who the hell allowed someone like that?
[03:14:37.754 --> 03:14:49.084]  Because I know from my experience, and I know what my buddies do with EOD, people who go through, those are active duty guys who typically, like Fort Bragg, Fort Bragg owns a section, basically, of the East Coast border.
[03:14:49.544 --> 03:14:52.547]  So any kind of presidential events that happen, those guys get tasked out
[03:14:53.007 --> 03:14:57.791]  To go and do this pre-search bomb sniffing and all that.
[03:14:57.851 --> 03:15:00.794]  Go run through these arenas or whatever.
[03:15:01.594 --> 03:15:07.159]  And most of the time there's a bomb sniffing dog on the scene watching the whole time.
[03:15:07.179 --> 03:15:11.242]  They go through the lines and all that beforehand.
[03:15:11.883 --> 03:15:13.945]  They're sniffing people as you go in and out.
[03:15:14.165 --> 03:15:17.347]  Everywhere inside the venue, every crook, every crevice.
[03:15:19.309 --> 03:15:21.091]  That, that's the story I believe more.
[03:15:21.131 --> 03:15:23.833]  That something happened, you know, maybe this guy was a plant though.
[03:15:24.133 --> 03:15:34.902]  You know, we've seen these guys like Aaron Black that have been uncovered because of the, you know, Project Veritas videos, you know, brought to us by James O'Keefe, thank God that this guy was able to get out there.
[03:15:36.656 --> 03:15:37.437]  Okay, Roger Stone.
[03:15:38.017 --> 03:15:52.666]  Alright, so, you know, we've got these videos showing how these guys have literally talked, working with the DNC, with Hillary Clinton, and sending these people, these thugs, out there to sit back and cite violence and do all this stuff.
[03:15:52.686 --> 03:15:53.787]  So this could be another thing.
[03:15:54.087 --> 03:15:59.010]  This could be another group of people we just don't know about yet because the other people have already been exposed.
[03:15:59.030 --> 03:15:59.970]  They've already been scratched.
[03:15:59.990 --> 03:16:00.631]  We found them.
[03:16:00.991 --> 03:16:02.271]  On to the next one, type of thing.
[03:16:02.311 --> 03:16:02.972]  Next guy up.
[03:16:03.152 --> 03:16:04.672]  Next alphabet bureaucracy.
[03:16:04.732 --> 03:16:06.013]  Next media matters.
[03:16:06.133 --> 03:16:07.553]  Next moveon.org.
[03:16:07.593 --> 03:16:09.214]  Whatever it is, they are on to the next one.
[03:16:09.534 --> 03:16:10.894]  And we know that they're doing this.
[03:16:10.974 --> 03:16:13.755]  We know that it's even come directly from Hillary Clinton.
[03:16:14.075 --> 03:16:18.817]  We know that these people, Kramer, Fovall, had direct ties to the White House.
[03:16:18.977 --> 03:16:19.857]  We know what they're doing.
[03:16:20.117 --> 03:16:23.018]  I think you might be on to something with that, that this could have been a plant.
[03:16:23.038 --> 03:16:25.119]  Yeah, it's probably a continuation of something like that.
[03:16:25.139 --> 03:16:26.559]  These guys are desperate, you know.
[03:16:26.699 --> 03:16:28.720]  It's at a point, you know,
[03:16:29.620 --> 03:16:30.681]  We found them with plants!
[03:16:30.721 --> 03:16:31.382]  We caught them!
[03:16:31.582 --> 03:16:33.263]  We've caught them with multiple plants!
[03:16:33.563 --> 03:16:35.425]  Jeb Bush did it, and Hillary did it!
[03:16:35.465 --> 03:16:36.586]  I'm sorry, Joe, go ahead.
[03:16:36.606 --> 03:16:37.567]  Well, think about this, though.
[03:16:37.587 --> 03:16:41.049]  Think about how strong the propaganda machine is right now.
[03:16:41.490 --> 03:16:48.496]  Because when I do turn on the TV, or if I listen to the radio, it's like neck and neck tie, neck and neck tie, Hillary up three points, this or that.
[03:16:48.836 --> 03:16:52.219]  And you listen to it, I mean, I'm not going to lie to you, it screws with your head some.
[03:16:52.299 --> 03:16:52.979]  You can't help it.
[03:16:52.999 --> 03:16:54.500]  You start going like, man, are we really?
[03:16:56.882 --> 03:16:59.805]  Because it screws with my head in a sense because I've been to a lot of the rallies.
[03:17:00.425 --> 03:17:02.967]  You know what, I know the large turnout for Trump.
[03:17:03.588 --> 03:17:06.250]  I know it far surpasses Hiller in any kind of way.
[03:17:06.310 --> 03:17:07.671]  They're trying to demoralize you though.
[03:17:07.691 --> 03:17:09.752]  Yeah, I know, and it works though sometimes.
[03:17:09.812 --> 03:17:11.834]  It gets under your skin and I literally have to pull myself back.
[03:17:11.854 --> 03:17:13.695]  Because they beat you over the head with it.
[03:17:14.076 --> 03:17:16.578]  They just beat you over the head with these lies.
[03:17:16.658 --> 03:17:19.960]  Like every weekend I literally have to suck myself back.
[03:17:20.040 --> 03:17:25.845]  I have to like submerge myself into video games sometimes to almost pull myself away
[03:17:28.406 --> 03:17:29.306]  What's the best way to put it?
[03:17:29.366 --> 03:17:31.607]  It's a release.
[03:17:31.867 --> 03:17:38.650]  Because if I don't, you almost kind of get sucked into it, because the mainstream media is like a vacuum.
[03:17:38.670 --> 03:17:43.851]  They're always trying to suck everything they can, every little soul, every little mind into it, and they want to control it.
[03:17:44.072 --> 03:17:45.552]  And then you get in that spin cycle.
[03:17:45.772 --> 03:17:48.173]  You know, Bill O'Reilly is like, oh, the spin stops here.
[03:17:48.213 --> 03:17:49.053]  No, it starts here.
[03:17:49.554 --> 03:17:50.754]  Oh, you're the one starting this thing.
[03:17:51.034 --> 03:17:52.815]  So we just found out Roger Stone's calling in.
[03:17:53.155 --> 03:17:56.217]  Yeah, so we are honored to be joined by Roger Stone.
[03:17:56.237 --> 03:18:03.380]  This is the first time I've actually spoken to Roger in person, so thank you for joining us late on a Saturday night, Roger.
[03:18:03.480 --> 03:18:05.241]  What is at the top of your mind right now?
[03:18:05.381 --> 03:18:08.222]  Obviously, I'm sure you've heard about the developments at the Trump rally.
[03:18:08.262 --> 03:18:09.403]  Do you have any intel there?
[03:18:09.443 --> 03:18:10.563]  What else is at the top of your mind?
[03:18:11.344 --> 03:18:18.207]  Yeah, I watched this, guys, in real time here at InfoWars, and of course this is the
[03:18:19.227 --> 03:18:40.047]  Recurring nightmare that I've had for about a year But the real irony and I'm glad to say see that candidate is safe and no one has been injured The real irony is if you went on Twitter right now There's at least 400 tweets perhaps more saying that Roger Stone staged this and
[03:18:41.272 --> 03:18:44.014]  To generate sympathy for Donald Trump.
[03:18:44.054 --> 03:18:56.841]  Now, this is this depraved criminal, David Brock, the guy who is... In the WikiLeaks, where they say this guy is a nut job for Hillary to steer clear of this guy.
[03:18:57.061 --> 03:19:00.062]  Like, even her own people are warning her about this guy.
[03:19:00.082 --> 03:19:01.043]  Like, this guy's a loon.
[03:19:01.403 --> 03:19:02.063]  Leave him alone.
[03:19:02.123 --> 03:19:05.685]  Yeah, no, I think the exact quote was, batshit crazy.
[03:19:06.986 --> 03:19:09.126]  But these are his trolls, you see.
[03:19:09.146 --> 03:19:14.028]  I don't know who in their camp planned this attempted assault on Trump.
[03:19:14.128 --> 03:19:19.569]  Now it fails, and we immediately, you know, it's almost, I mean, Joseph Goebbels would be proud.
[03:19:19.629 --> 03:19:24.030]  They're right out immediately spinning that this is our fault, that we did this.
[03:19:24.390 --> 03:19:28.891]  I mean, it is so outrageous that I had to call in and comment on it.
[03:19:28.911 --> 03:19:30.211]  Hey, Roger, this is Joe.
[03:19:30.811 --> 03:19:33.192]  Like, how amazing is this?
[03:19:33.252 --> 03:19:40.836]  I mean, we were speaking about this earlier, I don't know if you were listening, but, you know, earlier today, Hillary Clinton leaves her rally because it is raining.
[03:19:41.256 --> 03:19:44.578]  You have Donald Trump sitting there, giving a speech.
[03:19:44.718 --> 03:19:46.739]  We're at this pivotal point in America right now.
[03:19:46.779 --> 03:19:48.439]  We're fighting to take it back.
[03:19:48.840 --> 03:19:56.223]  And you have a man, you know, a possible assassination attempt, whatever, you know, whatever have you, you know, Secret Service rushes him off stage.
[03:19:56.583 --> 03:19:57.824]  He comes back out.
[03:19:58.871 --> 03:20:03.972]  Finishes the speech and then releases a statement saying, hey, you know, we're all going to survive this.
[03:20:03.992 --> 03:20:05.312]  We got to make America great again.
[03:20:05.332 --> 03:20:07.733]  I want to thank my Secret Service, my law enforcement.
[03:20:07.753 --> 03:20:10.073]  I mean, what kind of balls does that take, Roger?
[03:20:10.933 --> 03:20:13.154]  No, the guy's got enormous courage.
[03:20:13.334 --> 03:20:15.514]  I mean, he's got enormous physical courage.
[03:20:15.874 --> 03:20:24.396]  He is well aware of the fact that since his candidacy caught fire, that he was taking his life in his hands anytime he went out in public.
[03:20:25.466 --> 03:20:27.046]  But he's very fatalistic about it.
[03:20:27.166 --> 03:20:29.547]  He understands that he's at the crest of a movement.
[03:20:29.707 --> 03:20:35.628]  He really does understand it's not about him, but about what we need to do to take back our country.
[03:20:35.648 --> 03:20:39.089]  I spoke to him, I guess, yesterday.
[03:20:39.849 --> 03:20:42.230]  He was in an extraordinarily good mood.
[03:20:42.950 --> 03:20:47.111]  I mean, he can feel the traction in the country.
[03:20:47.151 --> 03:20:53.912]  He can feel, you know, the critical mass building behind his campaign, and having been through
[03:20:54.964 --> 03:20:56.925]  Nine presidential campaigns.
[03:21:14.383 --> 03:21:15.704]  I think he's going to peak at exactly the right time.
[03:21:30.376 --> 03:21:34.021]  And this is what the internal polls are indicating right now, Roger.
[03:21:34.041 --> 03:21:34.742]  We've seen that.
[03:21:34.782 --> 03:21:38.968]  Now, I have two thoughts, and I'd like to hear your thoughts as a follow-up on this.
[03:21:39.489 --> 03:21:43.094]  First of all, Joe Bix has brought up the idea, hashtag Alex Jones was right.
[03:21:43.734 --> 03:21:46.418]  As we just covered, Goebbels would be happy.
[03:21:47.099 --> 03:21:50.622]  They immediately take something that happened and they blame us.
[03:21:50.702 --> 03:21:51.722]  They blame the Patriots.
[03:21:51.862 --> 03:21:54.324]  Alex Jones has been saying they were going to be doing this for a long time.
[03:21:54.624 --> 03:21:55.285]  Now they're doing it.
[03:21:55.565 --> 03:22:00.489]  But also, this is what I'd really like to hear your opinion on and maybe a more in-depth analysis of this.
[03:22:01.681 --> 03:22:19.645]  If we actually start seeing citizens organically attempting to take Donald Trump's life or attempting to incite violence and stuff like this, we know that the Clinton campaign is trying to pull that stuff off, but if it starts to happen organically, I'm looking right at the mainstream media and that is who to blame.
[03:22:19.885 --> 03:22:21.645]  They've painted a picture of Donald Trump.
[03:22:22.106 --> 03:22:28.187]  Of course, if there was actually a racist, a fascist, somebody this bad like the media is painting Donald Trump to be,
[03:22:28.667 --> 03:22:30.549]  Of course people are going to want to react.
[03:22:30.609 --> 03:22:31.950]  Of course there's going to be backlash.
[03:22:32.190 --> 03:22:35.594]  Of course that's not the truth, but you're going to stir up these crazies.
[03:22:35.934 --> 03:22:39.577]  Everything they try to say Alex Jones has been doing, they're actually doing.
[03:22:39.658 --> 03:22:40.258]  Roger Stone?
[03:22:41.279 --> 03:22:45.343]  Yeah, that has been the whole Kafka-esque point of this.
[03:22:46.044 --> 03:22:51.529]  In other words, Hillary takes huge dollars from the Russians
[03:22:52.631 --> 03:22:58.955]  To deliver the uranium confession in the United States and then she accuses Trump of being in the pocket of the Russians.
[03:22:58.975 --> 03:23:00.436]  It's a perfect example.
[03:23:00.636 --> 03:23:02.397]  Everything that Clintons have done...
[03:23:03.101 --> 03:23:08.744]  It's precisely what they turn around and attack Trump and his supporters for.
[03:23:08.784 --> 03:23:12.066]  It has an Alice in Wonderland quality to it.
[03:23:12.266 --> 03:23:14.227]  Well, that's why I love Dinesh D'Souza's movie, Hillary's America.
[03:23:14.267 --> 03:23:19.851]  No one in the mainstream media stopped for a second to say, no, wait a minute, wait a minute, that's not quite right.
[03:23:19.911 --> 03:23:26.674]  I mean, the Democrats last week demanding an investigation of the FBI.
[03:23:27.795 --> 03:23:29.376]  How dare they do their job?
[03:23:29.927 --> 03:23:33.190]  How dare they stop the cover-up of Hillary's crimes?
[03:23:33.290 --> 03:23:34.731]  Now they want Comey removed.
[03:23:35.111 --> 03:23:53.765]  They loved Comey back when he was engaging in the cover-up, but now that the stench has gotten so bad of the Clinton's crimes, and now that there are 650,000 new pieces of evidence in Huma Abedin's email server, it's kind of like the Watergate tapes.
[03:23:54.045 --> 03:23:54.946]  It's indelible.
[03:23:55.026 --> 03:23:56.307]  These people are going to prison.
[03:23:56.367 --> 03:23:58.048]  It's only a matter of time.
[03:23:59.341 --> 03:24:05.943]  Roger Stone joins us, Owen Schroyer and Joe Biggs here on a special Saturday night broadcast and there's so much developing.
[03:24:06.023 --> 03:24:07.844]  Obviously Donald Trump rallied tonight.
[03:24:08.464 --> 03:24:09.685]  An alleged gunman showed up.
[03:24:09.745 --> 03:24:11.305]  It appears that that was not the case.
[03:24:11.645 --> 03:24:17.727]  That it was somebody that may have been a plant, may have been an organic disturbance at the Trump rally.
[03:24:17.747 --> 03:24:19.308]  But Roger Stone joins us now to talk about it.
[03:24:19.348 --> 03:24:20.108]  They've blamed him.
[03:24:20.168 --> 03:24:23.009]  They've tried to set up a false narrative on him.
[03:24:23.029 --> 03:24:25.010]  I can't run into a building and scream fire.
[03:24:26.656 --> 03:24:28.877]  If people run out and something happens, I'm at fault for that.
[03:24:29.497 --> 03:24:35.620]  You know, why can't these people be held accountable for spreading this false narrative?
[03:24:35.760 --> 03:24:45.104]  And then, like you said, if this is an actual person who's been turning on the TV and seeing this propaganda and going, oh my God, this guy's a racist, he's a scumbag, he hates America.
[03:24:45.444 --> 03:24:47.084]  If Donald Trump truly wins, we're going to die.
[03:24:47.104 --> 03:24:49.545]  I've got to take this, you know, extreme action.
[03:24:49.565 --> 03:24:51.566]  I've got to save America for what he thinks.
[03:24:52.006 --> 03:24:54.067]  You know, these people should be held accountable for that.
[03:24:54.728 --> 03:24:55.728]  I find it truly disgusting.
[03:24:55.908 --> 03:25:04.277]  What do you think can be the explanation for the way Hillary Clinton has responded to the recent reopening of the investigation into her emails?
[03:25:04.317 --> 03:25:07.160]  For me, Roger, it shows their desperation.
[03:25:07.260 --> 03:25:09.723]  They know this is their final stand or it's jail.
[03:25:10.464 --> 03:25:16.991]  And more than anything, the absolute arrogance for Hillary Clinton to come out and try to dictate what the FBI does.
[03:25:17.031 --> 03:25:17.512]  Your thoughts?
[03:25:18.891 --> 03:25:22.553]  Well, I think that they, of course, have lived a charmed life.
[03:25:22.653 --> 03:25:30.377]  The Clintons have escaped so many punches, they have skirted so many scandals, and they've always gotten away with it.
[03:25:31.078 --> 03:25:34.019]  Frankly, they came very close this time.
[03:25:34.680 --> 03:25:41.003]  Comey gave them the benediction they were waiting for, and she was going to get away with it.
[03:25:41.263 --> 03:25:42.564]  Her problem now is
[03:25:43.493 --> 03:25:52.340]  Now that the New York Police Department has all these records, they cannot be bullied, they cannot be silenced, they will not go down in a cover-up.
[03:25:52.620 --> 03:25:53.240]  They just won't.
[03:25:53.921 --> 03:26:03.268]  So if the folks at Justice or at one faction of the FBI had any thoughts about trying to cover this up, that's out the window.
[03:26:04.308 --> 03:26:08.952]  Now, let's just say, theoretically, she narrowly wins, she appoints an Attorney General,
[03:26:09.930 --> 03:26:11.550]  She appoints an FBI director.
[03:26:11.810 --> 03:26:16.951]  She appoints law enforcement officials who seek to cover up these very scandals.
[03:26:17.632 --> 03:26:23.953]  You'll have an uprising in the country that will paralyze the government and cause a constitutional crisis.
[03:26:24.373 --> 03:26:26.073]  So that leads to my... There's no escape then.
[03:26:26.093 --> 03:26:26.973]  There's no escape now.
[03:26:27.334 --> 03:26:29.114]  Yeah, that leads to my next question.
[03:26:29.574 --> 03:26:34.515]  What do you know about maybe a soft coup coming in from within the government, with good sources inside?
[03:26:36.263 --> 03:26:42.165]  Well, look, we have a democratic society and let it hope that that's not how this goes down.
[03:26:43.445 --> 03:26:47.726]  This has to have a legal and constitutional conclusion to it.
[03:26:48.606 --> 03:27:00.049]  But, in a sense, you've had it because an element of the FBI, particularly the heroes at the New York Police Department, have finally said, no, enough, stop.
[03:27:00.350 --> 03:27:01.770]  No more cover-up for these people.
[03:27:01.850 --> 03:27:05.671]  They're going to be held responsible because, as we learned in Watergate,
[03:27:06.406 --> 03:27:10.648]  No person is above the law, not even the Clintons.
[03:27:10.708 --> 03:27:12.549]  They're living on borrowed time.
[03:27:12.969 --> 03:27:16.951]  Whether it catches up with them in time for this election remains to be seen.
[03:27:16.971 --> 03:27:25.776]  There's a lot of news here to digest in a very short period of time, and not many specifics, because I think we're going to get those going forward.
[03:27:26.596 --> 03:27:33.420]  But the bloom is off the rose, and I think they're staring into the abyss, and I think they know that.
[03:27:34.318 --> 03:27:37.479]  Roger, what do you think is next from WikiLeaks?
[03:27:38.019 --> 03:27:47.223]  With every data dump there's something new, there's a new little nugget, a new angle exposing a different side of them, a different side of their corruption.
[03:27:47.243 --> 03:27:50.764]  Do you have any guesses on what WikiLeaks might be exposing next?
[03:27:51.867 --> 03:28:00.429]  I really don't, although I must say that Assange has lived up to his billing in terms of the incredible material that he has disclosed.
[03:28:01.269 --> 03:28:20.053]  I do know that this new FBI probe, or I should say the reopening of the investigation into her emails, stemmed from an interview with a suspect in another matter who revealed
[03:28:20.825 --> 03:28:34.993]  To the FBI that the Clintons had shaken down the nation of Serbia for $2 million in order for the Serbian president to get a meeting with Barack Obama.
[03:28:35.754 --> 03:28:43.998]  That was the seminal event that caused the FBI to reopen the investigation.
[03:28:44.439 --> 03:28:50.022]  That is the recording that FBI Director Comey is referring to.
[03:28:51.778 --> 03:28:58.600]  And this whole thing is extraordinarily unlikely, the way this has come about.
[03:28:59.741 --> 03:29:02.062]  But I think it is now inexorable.
[03:29:03.062 --> 03:29:15.986]  WikiLeaks' disclosures are now, oddly enough, secondary to what we're going to learn, I suspect, from this NYPD-FBI-found treasure trove.
[03:29:17.174 --> 03:29:32.900]  We live in a day and age now where we have so many people who are so computer savvy, so many hackers, people who grew up in this computer age where they know how to manipulate, get in, find stuff based off emails, do all this and that, you know, and the power WikiLeaks had was exposing the names.
[03:29:32.940 --> 03:29:33.820]  That was the biggest thing.
[03:29:35.031 --> 03:29:45.645]  So we have the names like the Podestas and all these different people being exposed, being corrupt, and being involved in possible pedophilia rings, Jeffrey Epstein, all this stuff.
[03:29:46.826 --> 03:29:50.651]  So what I'm seeing now on 4chan and all this
[03:29:51.252 --> 03:29:58.537]  Which is a, you know, a communication site for people who go in and, you know, look for information, post stuff.
[03:29:59.077 --> 03:30:16.088]  There's a lot of people who have seen these emails, and they're finding the names of people, and they're going in and doing research on them, and they're finding some truly disturbing connections, just like we've seen the, do you want dominoes on your hot dog or pizza or whatever like that, you know, these weird code names.
[03:30:17.878 --> 03:30:21.739]  You know, my question is, is, you know, how true is a lot of this stuff?
[03:30:21.779 --> 03:30:27.640]  I mean, do you, do you, do you really think that these people are this sick?
[03:30:28.700 --> 03:30:32.441]  Do you really think that these people are that demonic?
[03:30:32.481 --> 03:30:40.342]  That they're, they're, they're just so, I don't know, blister- Is this, is this the loose end that if we tug it, it will bring down a pedophile ring?
[03:30:41.642 --> 03:30:42.783]  It appears that way.
[03:30:42.843 --> 03:30:44.743]  Look, it should not be shocking.
[03:30:45.623 --> 03:30:53.849]  To educated observers of the ruling elite, that there has always been this sub-thread of pedophilia.
[03:30:55.470 --> 03:31:11.402]  Jeffrey Epstein, the millionaire hedge fund operator, is found in a Palm Beach County Sheriff's Department undercover investigation to have raped 33 underage girls, the youngest 13, the oldest 17.
[03:31:14.576 --> 03:31:18.379]  He is allowed to plead to one count of solicitation.
[03:31:19.840 --> 03:31:24.803]  He gets a 15 month sentence.
[03:31:24.823 --> 03:31:25.464]  15 months.
[03:31:26.224 --> 03:31:31.488]  Where he only has to go to jail from 10 o'clock at night till 6 o'clock in the morning.
[03:31:32.108 --> 03:31:34.970]  During the day, he's free on his own recognizance.
[03:31:34.990 --> 03:31:35.871]  He can even travel.
[03:31:37.012 --> 03:31:41.535]  Unlike every other sexual criminal, sex criminal in Florida,
[03:31:42.239 --> 03:31:50.601]  He's not sent to the state penitentiary, he's allowed to serve his sentence in an air-conditioned wing of the Palm Beach County Jail.
[03:31:51.861 --> 03:32:08.745]  Now when the federal government, under George Bush, comes in to review the case, instead of subjecting him to more harsh penalties, they rubber-stamp the local Democratic prosecutor's conviction, and then they seal it.
[03:32:10.339 --> 03:32:15.003]  Why has this pedophile gotten bipartisan legal protection from the system?
[03:32:15.444 --> 03:32:17.165]  What is it that he knows?
[03:32:17.566 --> 03:32:20.929]  Or who is it that he has video of?
[03:32:22.210 --> 03:32:24.652]  I think we're going to find that out in these emails.
[03:32:25.112 --> 03:32:31.998]  And of course Julian Assange has been saying that the information that will be released in the emails will be
[03:32:32.878 --> 03:32:37.301]  Well, warrant a criminal investigation will warrant an arrest.
[03:32:37.741 --> 03:32:38.322]  Well, he was right.
[03:32:38.382 --> 03:32:38.882]  We've got it.
[03:32:39.482 --> 03:32:41.464]  I mean, we've got it right here.
[03:32:42.784 --> 03:32:43.545]  Do you think?
[03:32:43.825 --> 03:32:47.668]  And I think that they would like I mean, I think a RICO case is what we would all like to see.
[03:32:48.008 --> 03:32:49.889]  Who knows how far reaching that could be?
[03:32:50.429 --> 03:32:59.656]  But what do you think the odds are that we have a a more clear ideal of what is happening with this investigation before the election?
[03:32:59.836 --> 03:33:01.297]  Yeah, but think about this at one point.
[03:33:02.077 --> 03:33:06.819]  It's easier for her to blame the Russians, because then that shows that everything's fine here.
[03:33:07.459 --> 03:33:12.942]  If it comes out that this is coming from someone within the government who's leaking this stuff to WikiLeaks... Which it is.
[03:33:12.982 --> 03:33:23.626]  ...that shows that the government is against her, which makes her look weaker, and shows that there is no trust for her, which makes her, you know, it puts her in a point where she can't win.
[03:33:23.666 --> 03:33:25.447]  She doesn't have that upper hand.
[03:33:26.908 --> 03:33:29.829]  Well, but let's also assume at this point that Anthony Weiner
[03:33:30.814 --> 03:33:32.395]  Oh, they're definitely rolling over right now.
[03:34:00.976 --> 03:34:03.520]  The full impact it will have on the election.
[03:34:04.561 --> 03:34:13.073]  I suspect we're going to learn the worst of this after the election, but before the inauguration of the next president, whoever that might be.
[03:34:13.945 --> 03:34:21.647]  And if Trump wins, of course, things will play themselves out and I think whatever investigation is ongoing will continue and it won't affect us near as much.
[03:34:22.287 --> 03:34:25.148]  But let's talk about the awful prospect of Hillary Clinton winning.
[03:34:25.508 --> 03:34:31.849]  We could be looking at a scenario where she could be under FBI investigation while she's inaugurated.
[03:34:32.109 --> 03:34:36.650]  She could possibly have an indictment looming while she's inaugurated.
[03:34:36.971 --> 03:34:38.431]  And then there's the other added element
[03:34:38.931 --> 03:34:48.136]  What do you think the odds are, if something happens before she's inaugurated, and there's an indictment looming, that Barack Obama pardons her?
[03:34:49.837 --> 03:34:54.999]  I have predicted that on InfoWars now for over a year, that that would be the endgame.
[03:34:55.920 --> 03:35:03.864]  And the Nixon precedent makes it very clear that the president could pardon her prior to being indicted, could be
[03:35:04.733 --> 03:35:07.395]  Pardon her for crimes he doesn't even know about yet.
[03:35:07.516 --> 03:35:11.439]  He had technically could pardon her for all and any crimes that we may learn about.
[03:35:12.800 --> 03:35:15.042]  I think that has a high probability.
[03:35:15.903 --> 03:35:19.706]  Her ability to govern at that point would be impossible.
[03:35:20.127 --> 03:35:25.131]  There will be so many people outside the White House surrounding it, demanding she resign.
[03:35:25.532 --> 03:35:27.834]  It'll be very hard for her to govern in any way.
[03:35:28.868 --> 03:35:40.772]  I mean, I think it's fair to say at this point, and obviously we're not trying to compare this to things in the past as far as wars are concerned, but I mean, we're essentially in a civil war right now for this country.
[03:35:41.192 --> 03:35:47.014]  We the people versus the brainwashed masses and the corrupt Washington establishment that herds them.
[03:35:47.355 --> 03:35:51.016]  I mean, this is truly incredible, and I think it's sad, Roger,
[03:35:51.596 --> 03:35:55.057]  That there's so many Americans that have no idea what's going on.
[03:35:55.117 --> 03:35:57.398]  They don't understand the gravity of this election.
[03:35:57.438 --> 03:36:02.980]  They don't understand the peak that we're hitting right now, how important this truly is.
[03:36:03.600 --> 03:36:16.624]  And I'm just curious, what are your, I mean, this is kind of, this is kind of taking the conversation a different direction, but you know, we've obviously got the attacks coming on Donald Trump, all of these people now making claims, trying to file suit, sexual this, harassment that.
[03:36:17.464 --> 03:36:20.646]  What is Trump's strategy?
[03:36:20.907 --> 03:36:28.352]  Of course these all just happen to develop when Trump runs for president and starts kicking ass magically, but what is the reaction from the Trump campaign?
[03:36:29.052 --> 03:36:35.877]  What do Trump supporters do in their response to all of these allegations being levied against Trump here in the closing days?
[03:36:36.937 --> 03:36:40.660]  Well, I think fortunately they have lacked the ring of credibility.
[03:36:40.700 --> 03:36:45.844]  I'm sure you saw the 13-year-old woman, or the woman who claimed that Trump raped her at 13.
[03:36:47.722 --> 03:36:53.404]  A story that has been painted and nursed by the Clinton people for some time.
[03:36:53.764 --> 03:37:05.067]  This, I always suspected, since they knew that Bill Clinton has real vulnerabilities in terms of his association with Epstein, this was a somehow attempt to neutralize Trump.
[03:37:05.467 --> 03:37:07.347]  Anyway, this woman has dropped her lawsuit.
[03:37:07.607 --> 03:37:08.908]  She's not coming forward.
[03:37:09.168 --> 03:37:10.348]  Oh, shocking.
[03:37:10.708 --> 03:37:14.149]  She never did reveal her name, but that's because this never happened.
[03:37:14.855 --> 03:37:17.056]  So this false flag just collapsed.
[03:37:17.876 --> 03:37:31.379]  David Brock must be curious, because I figure he was the guy who probably propped this phony... I'm actually reading a lot of stuff on David Brock right now that keeps popping up that people are going into that's going to be... I think it'll be breaking probably tomorrow.
[03:37:31.399 --> 03:37:32.779]  It's going to be pretty huge.
[03:37:32.799 --> 03:37:35.280]  It's going to make a lot of people smile when they read it.
[03:37:35.360 --> 03:37:36.960]  He'd be going down with the rest of them.
[03:37:37.180 --> 03:37:40.501]  I mean, David Brock is a money laundering sleazebag.
[03:37:41.499 --> 03:37:42.240]  He's a psycho!
[03:37:42.280 --> 03:37:45.182]  Yeah, there's only five minutes, although he may enjoy prison, who knows?
[03:37:47.143 --> 03:37:48.684]  Yeah, that's a good, that's the truth.
[03:37:48.744 --> 03:37:50.205]  Possibly, but you know.
[03:37:50.425 --> 03:37:51.966]  You know, think about this though.
[03:37:52.426 --> 03:37:57.030]  Say if I were unemployed right now and I went to McDonald's and I filed for employment, I try to get a job there.
[03:37:57.450 --> 03:38:01.713]  If they found out that I was being investigated by the FBI, I'd be denied.
[03:38:01.733 --> 03:38:03.714]  I wouldn't be able to get a job there.
[03:38:04.234 --> 03:38:06.036]  So how in the hell can this woman
[03:38:06.896 --> 03:38:09.780]  I'm sorry Roger, I don't mean to scream in your ear.
[03:38:10.020 --> 03:38:12.202]  I can't freaking stand this, man.
[03:38:12.242 --> 03:38:14.004]  I mean, we're getting fired up here, Roger.
[03:38:25.157 --> 03:38:27.098]  I can't even get a job at McDonald's!
[03:38:27.238 --> 03:38:29.838]  Roger, they're trying to steal this election from Trump.
[03:38:29.878 --> 03:38:32.279]  We know that that is in their cards.
[03:38:32.779 --> 03:38:35.660]  What are we doing right now to avoid them stealing this election?
[03:38:35.720 --> 03:38:37.141]  How can we stop the steal?
[03:38:38.481 --> 03:38:39.761]  Let me give you a quick fill.
[03:38:40.121 --> 03:38:45.223]  Late yesterday we were victorious in Arizona where a federal judge ruled for us that our
[03:38:46.005 --> 03:38:56.956]  Exit poll program to check the veracity and integrity of the machines did not intimidate voters and he dismissed the lawsuit from the Clinton thugs.
[03:38:58.077 --> 03:39:05.985]  I have to respond to the court in Nevada on Monday as well as Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.
[03:39:06.665 --> 03:39:10.349]  I believe we will prevail in all of those places.
[03:39:11.195 --> 03:39:13.976]  In Ohio, there's already a ruling against us.
[03:39:14.056 --> 03:39:22.417]  That's because the Democratic lawyers representing the Clintons lied to the judge and told them I had been properly served.
[03:39:23.277 --> 03:39:25.158]  I was never served in this lawsuit.
[03:39:25.698 --> 03:39:27.498]  I never knew of its existence.
[03:39:27.818 --> 03:39:31.779]  I didn't know that there was a proceeding to which I was supposed to attend.
[03:39:32.259 --> 03:39:36.140]  So, they defrauded the court in order to get this ruling.
[03:39:36.980 --> 03:39:44.342]  We will appeal to the Ohio Appeals Court on Monday morning and we will provide a witness and what other information.
[03:39:44.462 --> 03:39:59.885]  Just to say it again, standing outside of a polling place and politely asking somebody who has voted to participate in a completely neutral exit poll determining for whom they voted
[03:40:01.920 --> 03:40:05.221]  Cannot in any way constitute intimidation.
[03:40:05.421 --> 03:40:07.181]  Exactly, because they've already voted.
[03:40:07.682 --> 03:40:23.886]  And the people who are helping us with Stop the Steal, sure, they're Trump supporters, and Gary Johnson supporters, and Jill Stein supporters, and Bernie Sanders supporters, and Libertarians, and Green Party members, and Republicans.
[03:40:23.906 --> 03:40:25.166]  You know what we have in common?
[03:40:25.806 --> 03:40:27.627]  We want an honest election.
[03:40:27.767 --> 03:40:29.387]  That's the goal of our program.
[03:40:29.527 --> 03:40:31.188]  Just an honest election.
[03:40:31.764 --> 03:40:39.834]  So the idea that this is some kind of a Republican front to intimidate voters is hogwash.
[03:40:39.894 --> 03:40:40.655]  It's rhetoric.
[03:40:41.215 --> 03:40:43.137]  It's like an American watchdog thing.
[03:40:43.218 --> 03:40:44.439]  Everybody's a neighborhood watch.
[03:40:45.440 --> 03:40:51.848]  Yeah, I mean, all we're trying to do here is to conduct a valid, scientifically neutral exit poll.
[03:40:52.711 --> 03:40:59.896]  In certain select key precincts to compare against the machines in those precincts.
[03:40:59.956 --> 03:41:08.482]  We're not going to be enough precincts nationwide to ensure the integrity or lack of the entire election.
[03:41:08.562 --> 03:41:09.703]  That is not our goal.
[03:41:09.863 --> 03:41:15.947]  Our goal is to try to determine whether there is a pattern of irregularity.
[03:41:16.880 --> 03:41:17.360]  The U.S.
[03:41:17.401 --> 03:41:30.792]  State Department has a federal guideline in which we judge foreign elections that holds that the deviation between the actual results and the exit polls cannot be more than 2%.
[03:41:32.228 --> 03:41:41.830]  All we're asking here is that our next United States election is here to our own State Department standards, Hillary Clinton's standards, if you will.
[03:41:42.650 --> 03:41:47.652]  And with that, I see that the lawyer, my lawyer, is calling me because we've got to go through a deposition tonight.
[03:41:47.772 --> 03:41:51.652]  So I'm going to jump off, but gents, it was great to join you for a few minutes.
[03:41:51.832 --> 03:41:52.633]  Absolutely, Roger.
[03:41:52.673 --> 03:41:53.673]  We thank you for your time.
[03:41:54.935 --> 03:42:04.359]  So there goes Roger Stone, an absolute warrior in this election cycle for the Patriot movement that has become the Trump movement, Joe Biggs.
[03:42:04.539 --> 03:42:08.100]  And I think I've got my buddy on standby right now, Morgan.
[03:42:08.561 --> 03:42:09.401]  Is he patched in?
[03:42:11.102 --> 03:42:12.462]  All right, let's get Morgan on real quick.
[03:42:12.482 --> 03:42:14.883]  He's someone who's already got some really good stuff to say.
[03:42:14.903 --> 03:42:16.344]  Hey, Outlaw Morgan, you there?
[03:42:17.418 --> 03:42:17.818]  Yes, man.
[03:42:17.858 --> 03:42:18.559]  How's it going, guys?
[03:42:18.639 --> 03:42:19.400]  What's going on, man?
[03:42:19.420 --> 03:42:22.242]  What do you think about what's going on right now with this whole election, man?
[03:42:22.283 --> 03:42:29.990]  Like, you know, what's going through your mind as someone who's out there every day like I am, like we are here at InfoWars, you know, reading the news, doing these videos.
[03:42:30.410 --> 03:42:30.930]  What do you see?
[03:42:30.971 --> 03:42:31.931]  What do you foresee happening?
[03:42:33.072 --> 03:42:36.095]  Well, you know, man, I'm no Naftadamus, but here's the thing.
[03:42:36.355 --> 03:42:38.157]  I see all these leaks just like you guys.
[03:42:38.237 --> 03:42:40.599]  I read a lot of this material that comes out on the internet.
[03:42:40.720 --> 03:42:42.521]  I hear a lot of people that, you know, send me emails.
[03:42:42.601 --> 03:42:43.202]  I hear them out.
[03:42:43.982 --> 03:42:48.745]  But at the end of the day, we have to kind of dilute it down somewhat, and we have to get back to principles.
[03:42:49.625 --> 03:43:01.072]  Because with WikiLeaks to the side, even though the corruption's exposed, and it's detrimental, and it's evil, and the depths are just limitless, we have to get back to the idea of democracy.
[03:43:01.852 --> 03:43:07.696]  And I think right now what we are actually witnessing through oligarchy practice is the death of democracy.
[03:43:08.456 --> 03:43:13.199]  And even though we're not a democratic society, per se, or whatever, we're a constitutional republic,
[03:43:13.891 --> 03:43:19.652]  You know, I think it's important that people understand that basically, in a nutshell, what's happening here is the DNC's been exposed time and time again.
[03:43:19.712 --> 03:43:23.613]  I mean, Tim Kaine ran it, Debbie Watchman Schultz ran it, and now Donna Brazile.
[03:43:23.633 --> 03:43:24.454]  And they're all tainted.
[03:43:24.854 --> 03:43:30.835]  And, uh, basically when they get knocked off the DNC chairman status, they get adopted back into the campaign.
[03:43:30.935 --> 03:43:33.456]  I mean, dude, we got a blood trail going behind Hillary Clinton.
[03:43:33.476 --> 03:43:34.376]  It's just ridiculous.
[03:43:34.916 --> 03:43:37.937]  Now, one of the things I found in my studies of venturing out into the world,
[03:43:38.823 --> 03:43:44.025]  Is that Trump supporters are actually highly educated into how the political structure works, believe it or not.
[03:43:45.525 --> 03:43:46.865]  I've also gone to Hillary rallies.
[03:43:46.885 --> 03:43:59.689]  When you go to Hillary rallies, the thing I find to be the most crazy thing of all is when I'm standing there, whether we're having a civil conversation or we're yelling at each other, whatever the case is, I find them to always ask me, where's my proof?
[03:44:01.160 --> 03:44:08.764]  As if they don't have cell phones or computers and can't do the... Not to cut these people down, but I find that they're uneducated somewhat.
[03:44:08.784 --> 03:44:09.444]  They're oblivious.
[03:44:09.784 --> 03:44:11.365]  These are the Kim Kardashians.
[03:44:11.485 --> 03:44:14.447]  I mean, basically, these are the crowd that keep up with the Kardashians.
[03:44:14.487 --> 03:44:17.748]  They only care about Starbucks policies and stuff like that.
[03:44:17.768 --> 03:44:19.069]  I mean, they're surface people.
[03:44:19.089 --> 03:44:20.150]  They don't scratch the surface.
[03:44:21.070 --> 03:44:25.433]  But in a nutshell, at the end of the day, what I see is oligarchy coming full scale.
[03:44:25.453 --> 03:44:29.675]  Basically, what they're doing is they're raping the system.
[03:44:30.720 --> 03:44:37.064]  And my sense is here is that we don't do something to actually put together a force to stop it.
[03:44:37.624 --> 03:44:45.348]  I mean, we're living in a society where the NYPD has enough that they say they're going to go make arrests, and then they have to battle with the Department of Justice.
[03:44:46.328 --> 03:44:49.330]  Why is it that people aren't working together in the name of justice?
[03:44:50.090 --> 03:44:52.552]  Then you have, you know, Loretta- It's the hidden civil war.
[03:44:54.042 --> 03:45:03.247]  Yeah, so it's like, I honestly feel like, I have a lot of, you guys probably know, I mean I have a lot of people that follow me on Facebook that are Patriots.
[03:45:03.607 --> 03:45:10.090]  Active, inactive military, a lot of 1776ers and stuff like that, and I mean, a lot of these guys have blood in their eyes right now.
[03:45:10.230 --> 03:45:11.751]  Like, they're ready, you know what I mean?
[03:45:11.771 --> 03:45:14.552]  So it's like, I get a lot of people asking, what do we do?
[03:45:14.612 --> 03:45:15.233]  When do we do it?
[03:45:15.253 --> 03:45:17.514]  And I'm like, man, you gotta wait for the shot to be turned around the world.
[03:45:18.208 --> 03:45:33.422]  So, I do truly believe, and I'm not one to condone or incite violence, so don't take me the wrong way, but I definitely feel that if Hillary Clinton's pretty much pushed into that office by the evil that runs this country, then we are definitely entering a time where that's the shot heard around the world.
[03:45:33.542 --> 03:45:36.644]  No, I mean, I believe that if she's still in this election, she gets in.
[03:45:36.705 --> 03:45:41.108]  I mean, like I said, I've been to numerous of these rallies, you know, Trump rallies, tons.
[03:45:42.490 --> 03:45:44.151]  Owen Schroer, I know you've been to some.
[03:45:44.171 --> 03:45:46.312]  You know, Rob Doo's been to tons as well.
[03:45:46.812 --> 03:45:48.592]  And I monitor them all day.
[03:45:48.612 --> 03:45:53.834]  Yeah, I mean, you know, if you're not there, you can watch them and you see the energy surrounding them.
[03:45:54.015 --> 03:45:55.875]  You see zero energy for Hillary Clinton.
[03:45:55.895 --> 03:45:58.556]  You see people trying to get people excited about it.
[03:45:58.756 --> 03:46:02.498]  When you go to a Donald Trump rally, people are, it's like a revival.
[03:46:03.356 --> 03:46:05.858]  Like, when you go to a Trump rally, it's like a revival!
[03:46:06.119 --> 03:46:11.864]  You stand outside, and people are like, shouting, in the line, jumping up and down, and like, USA!
[03:46:12.004 --> 03:46:13.706]  USA!
[03:46:14.046 --> 03:46:14.186]  USA!
[03:46:14.267 --> 03:46:14.387]  USA!
[03:46:14.527 --> 03:46:16.248]  It's like, I am Sparta!
[03:46:16.649 --> 03:46:21.694]  You know, everyone's sitting there, intense, like, screaming, Lock her up!
[03:46:21.834 --> 03:46:22.895]  Lock her up!
[03:46:23.355 --> 03:46:24.096]  Lock her up!
[03:46:24.116 --> 03:46:24.836]  Lock her up!
[03:46:24.877 --> 03:46:25.997]  Lock her up!
[03:46:26.258 --> 03:46:31.582]  And now all you see the entire time, there's such a movement behind it.
[03:46:31.962 --> 03:46:38.547]  So if somehow Donald Trump gets cheated, if Hillary Clinton steals this election, you will see some form of 1776.
[03:46:40.269 --> 03:46:51.358]  People will rise up, whether it be actual something on the streets, or will it be people, like I said earlier, clearly turning their back on her, not listening to her commands, saying, you know what, we're not going to follow you.
[03:46:51.858 --> 03:46:55.643]  I think that's one of the most powerful things, a statement that people could do.
[03:46:55.663 --> 03:47:05.835]  Because the entire country, you know, we see how there's this internal coup within the FBI and all this stuff, how people wanted to look into the Hillary Clinton thing and wanted to prosecute her, wanted to indict her.
[03:47:06.176 --> 03:47:09.900]  But then Comey still came out and said, no, no one would ever do this, no one would take this case.
[03:47:10.501 --> 03:47:16.206]  We're seeing an internal coup, so if somehow she cheats this, somehow she steals this, you will see people turn on her.
[03:47:16.506 --> 03:47:17.707]  They're not going to listen to her commands.
[03:47:17.727 --> 03:47:19.049]  They're not going to listen to her BS.
[03:47:19.449 --> 03:47:21.150]  And that will be so powerful.
[03:47:21.190 --> 03:47:22.091]  What do you say, outlaw?
[03:47:23.292 --> 03:47:24.834]  Well, I think you're absolutely right.
[03:47:24.954 --> 03:47:28.597]  I mean, and at the end of the day, if you think about it, imagine what she went through.
[03:47:29.235 --> 03:47:41.932]  When she got the word that it wasn't Russia that hacked the server, when she got the word that it was actually US intel working with Julian Assange to create this plethora of information that has flooded the internet, imagine what went through her mind.
[03:47:41.972 --> 03:47:46.899]  I looked at a Milo video today where he basically recaps how many times he said Russia.
[03:47:47.339 --> 03:47:48.401]  And it was insane.
[03:47:48.521 --> 03:47:50.023]  I was just laughing the entire time.
[03:47:50.043 --> 03:47:52.686]  But what's not funny is the severity of her message in itself.
[03:47:52.746 --> 03:47:54.909]  She had been said, let's go to war with Russia.
[03:47:55.330 --> 03:47:55.990]  Cyber attacks.
[03:47:56.030 --> 03:47:57.012]  I'll go to war with Russia.
[03:47:57.512 --> 03:48:00.556]  And now it's like, she looks like a big fat dummy.
[03:48:00.757 --> 03:48:01.998]  I mean, you're sitting there like a...
[03:48:02.819 --> 03:48:05.100]  Like a pin the tail on the donkey looking kind of thing, you know?
[03:48:05.140 --> 03:48:09.602]  Like, you said this millions of times that you're ready to go to war with Russia, and it turns out it wasn't Russia.
[03:48:09.642 --> 03:48:15.825]  It was people inside the United States that have had enough, and they're ready to end your reign of power.
[03:48:15.945 --> 03:48:20.887]  I mean, because here's the thing, if we don't stop this, man, and you guys are more in tune than most, I mean, so you know.
[03:48:22.102 --> 03:48:28.966]  The Soros of life, the JP Morgan's, I'm sorry, Sullivan and JP, you know, all these banks, they continue to reign.
[03:48:29.026 --> 03:48:34.188]  It's funny that she claims she doesn't work for these entities, but that's where all of her donors come from.
[03:48:34.269 --> 03:48:37.610]  I mean, at what point do we actually start holding people accountable is my main thing.
[03:48:37.730 --> 03:48:44.874]  I mean, you know, when you see that someone's taking foreign money from foreign countries and it's influencing politics and there's WikiLeaks saying we got major donors,
[03:48:45.414 --> 03:48:47.195]  Asking about executive orders.
[03:48:47.435 --> 03:48:49.277]  I think that should have been a flag right there.
[03:48:49.297 --> 03:48:56.481]  But the problem is, is that this lady has had a reign of terror inside the political system that runs Washington for over 35 years.
[03:48:56.741 --> 03:48:58.002]  So she feels untouchable.
[03:48:58.442 --> 03:49:00.623]  And you know, let me just, let me just say this as well.
[03:49:01.284 --> 03:49:08.688]  You might have to bring Beyonce and Jay Z to pack a place with 10,000 people, but there was 11,000 people to Donald Trump and he was by himself.
[03:49:09.369 --> 03:49:11.250]  So this is like a Ron Paul theory to me.
[03:49:11.832 --> 03:49:18.034]  There is this momentum that's behind this traffic, a flow of people, and the volume of support, the magnitude is just obscene.
[03:49:18.555 --> 03:49:19.175]  And we see it.
[03:49:19.355 --> 03:49:20.055]  It's tangible.
[03:49:20.195 --> 03:49:20.855]  You can view it.
[03:49:20.975 --> 03:49:21.536]  It's visual.
[03:49:22.436 --> 03:49:23.856]  No one shows up for Hillary, man.
[03:49:24.357 --> 03:49:24.777]  No one.
[03:49:25.037 --> 03:49:30.519]  So, at the end of the day, if they slide her into office, like I said, I feel like that's a shot heard around the world, and for the sake of
[03:49:31.204 --> 03:49:31.704]  We're good to go.
[03:49:51.311 --> 03:49:53.932]  And I'm hoping in the end we get a rake, you know?
[03:49:53.972 --> 03:49:56.793]  So they're trying to say that Hillary's all up in these numbers.
[03:49:56.834 --> 03:49:57.794]  We know the system's raked.
[03:49:57.834 --> 03:49:59.134]  We know the media lies to us.
[03:49:59.174 --> 03:50:05.557]  And that's why it's important that there's people like you guys, people like myself, people that are all throughout the internet that are boots on the ground.
[03:50:05.997 --> 03:50:07.118]  They're going out to these events.
[03:50:07.178 --> 03:50:09.199]  They're showcasing these events.
[03:50:09.559 --> 03:50:10.939]  They're monitoring all this stuff.
[03:50:10.979 --> 03:50:13.020]  They're trying to expose as much truth as they can.
[03:50:13.500 --> 03:50:16.562]  So we can't allow them to steal it from us.
[03:50:17.682 --> 03:50:18.943]  You know, that's just where I'm at with it.
[03:50:19.003 --> 03:50:21.506]  So, you know, at the end of the day, she's a criminal.
[03:50:21.666 --> 03:50:24.629]  She's as corrupt as anyone could have ever been in politics.
[03:50:24.669 --> 03:50:27.372]  In my eyes, probably the most corrupt woman to ever touch politics.
[03:50:28.109 --> 03:50:29.990]  So, I'm not even a woman.
[03:50:30.010 --> 03:50:31.350]  Let's not even put gender in the equation.
[03:50:31.370 --> 03:50:34.412]  She's the most corrupt person to ever have touched politics at this point.
[03:50:35.032 --> 03:50:39.254]  And I would personally, before I die in my lifetime, I would like to see this stop.
[03:50:39.594 --> 03:50:40.454]  I mean, I have children.
[03:50:40.474 --> 03:50:42.475]  I'm sure, you know, you've got a baby on the way, Joe.
[03:50:42.535 --> 03:50:43.035]  Yes, sir.
[03:50:44.096 --> 03:50:49.018]  So, you know, that's my concern is that I'm afraid that we're really watching the world that I grew up in die.
[03:50:50.282 --> 03:50:51.262]  Great points, man.
[03:50:51.323 --> 03:50:52.263]  Love you, brother, man.
[03:50:52.283 --> 03:50:55.226]  You're like the twin I never knew I had, man.
[03:50:55.266 --> 03:50:56.467]  We're like identical.
[03:50:57.108 --> 03:50:58.950]  It was great seeing you up in D.C., man.
[03:50:59.430 --> 03:51:01.292]  It's good to meet other like-minded people, man.
[03:51:01.672 --> 03:51:04.755]  You know, you guys can follow him on Facebook, Outlaw Morgan.
[03:51:04.795 --> 03:51:06.056]  He puts out videos all the time.
[03:51:06.717 --> 03:51:07.898]  Amazing talking point.
[03:51:07.938 --> 03:51:08.939]  So thanks for calling, brother.
[03:51:08.979 --> 03:51:09.700]  I appreciate it, man.
[03:51:09.740 --> 03:51:10.461]  It's been great to hear you.
[03:51:10.481 --> 03:51:11.662]  Absolutely.
[03:51:11.682 --> 03:51:12.162]  Alright, take care, bud.
[03:51:12.362 --> 03:51:12.843]  Alright, later, man.
[03:51:13.905 --> 03:51:20.247]  Alright folks, so here's how the rest of this Saturday night's emergency transition is going to go.
[03:51:20.407 --> 03:51:21.647]  If you guys want to just go ahead.
[03:51:21.707 --> 03:51:23.008]  We're not going to take any more callers.
[03:51:23.048 --> 03:51:24.808]  We'll take the callers we have on the line.
[03:51:25.268 --> 03:51:26.289]  We'll clear the callers.
[03:51:27.349 --> 03:51:29.910]  And then, I'm going to sing a song I wrote.
[03:51:30.270 --> 03:51:31.650]  Joe, you're welcome to join me.
[03:51:31.830 --> 03:51:33.971]  The crew back there in the back is welcome to join me.
[03:51:34.151 --> 03:51:35.011]  I'm no vocalist.
[03:51:35.091 --> 03:51:36.051]  What's the tune to?
[03:51:36.231 --> 03:51:37.252]  We'll play the tune.
[03:51:37.412 --> 03:51:39.752]  Have you ever heard the Imperial March?
[03:51:42.324 --> 03:51:44.366]  No, no, no, no.
[03:51:44.406 --> 03:51:45.027]  It's not like that.
[03:51:45.247 --> 03:51:46.108]  No, no, no, no.
[03:51:47.090 --> 03:51:51.475]  On the air on Thursday, Alex Jones issued a challenge to the reporters here.
[03:51:51.615 --> 03:51:54.099]  How can we hijack the Cubs World Series victory?
[03:51:54.699 --> 03:51:55.620]  And I know how.
[03:51:55.921 --> 03:51:57.303]  I've got the song right here.
[03:51:57.323 --> 03:51:57.943]  We're going to steal it.
[03:51:57.963 --> 03:51:59.966]  But we're going to do that when we sign off the air.
[03:52:00.186 --> 03:52:10.695]  Before I take these calls, again folks, we're going to be doing a live broadcast for 52 hours, Monday through Wednesday, the election special, 52 hour live broadcast.
[03:52:10.855 --> 03:52:15.278]  Make sure that you tune into that for the best election coverage, probably on the planet.
[03:52:16.039 --> 03:52:22.544]  And be sure to go to our store, InfoWarsStore.com, best health products you can find for the best price.
[03:52:22.885 --> 03:52:26.427]  These are the products that I use, this is how you support this
[03:52:27.428 --> 03:52:28.309]  Uh, production.
[03:52:28.429 --> 03:52:29.270]  Everything we do.
[03:52:29.430 --> 03:52:31.352]  Hiring people like Joe Nicks, myself.
[03:52:31.452 --> 03:52:33.013]  You know where I saw these products at last?
[03:52:33.834 --> 03:52:34.194]  Haiti.
[03:52:35.115 --> 03:52:35.395]  Really?
[03:52:35.735 --> 03:52:36.776]  I kid you not.
[03:52:36.816 --> 03:52:37.617]  They have them in Haiti?
[03:52:38.478 --> 03:52:39.839]  No, people there had them.
[03:52:40.319 --> 03:52:41.020]  Like Haitians.
[03:52:41.200 --> 03:52:46.444]  I was in Port-au-Prince, and I'm in the airport there, and I'm with Gary Haven, and maybe he has something to do with it.
[03:52:46.484 --> 03:52:49.807]  Maybe he's helped introduce the products to the Haitians.
[03:52:50.788 --> 03:52:53.069]  We were doing a meeting talking about the events for the day.
[03:52:53.129 --> 03:53:05.277]  It's like 7 o'clock in the morning, you know, we're having breakfast, and we're talking about all our, like, our flight plan, where we're gonna fly to, we're gonna deliver food, what Medivacs we have planned, who we're gonna take out, who's injured, you know, the, uh...
[03:53:06.411 --> 03:53:13.074]  The list of, you know, who should be up front, you know, based off, you know, spinal snabs, femur fracture, fractures, all that stuff.
[03:53:13.614 --> 03:53:25.200]  And I'm sitting here, we're going to this meeting, and I look over and I see X2, and I see Super Mel Vitality, and I see Colloidal Silver sitting off in the corner, and we're in a Haitian airport office.
[03:53:25.840 --> 03:53:29.901]  And, uh, you know, there's like the, the Haitian president or whatever and all the stuff on the wall, these pictures.
[03:53:30.321 --> 03:53:31.441]  And I'm like, who's is this?
[03:53:31.521 --> 03:53:33.502]  And it's this guy who's from Haiti.
[03:53:33.522 --> 03:53:34.522]  He's like, oh, it's mine.
[03:53:34.862 --> 03:53:35.622]  He's like, I love it.
[03:53:35.682 --> 03:53:36.343]  It's amazing.
[03:53:36.363 --> 03:53:38.443]  And I'm like, it is amazing though.
[03:53:38.483 --> 03:53:41.444]  He goes, he goes, oh, I've been taking it for quite some time since 2010.
[03:53:42.004 --> 03:53:43.624]  I'm like, are you serious?
[03:53:43.664 --> 03:53:45.825]  He goes, oh yeah, all my friends take it now.
[03:53:45.885 --> 03:53:48.305]  I'll make so it's not just here.
[03:53:48.365 --> 03:53:49.426]  It's all over the place.
[03:53:49.446 --> 03:53:50.306]  Like people love it.
[03:53:50.806 --> 03:53:52.406]  Well, I can tell you, I don't know about you.
[03:53:52.426 --> 03:53:54.687]  A lot of these products, uh, products have been,
[03:53:55.882 --> 03:53:58.124]  Call it life changing by the people that have taken them.
[03:54:15.620 --> 03:54:19.261]  Well, I think that for me, I mean, I drank tap water my whole life.
[03:54:19.301 --> 03:54:23.283]  I never thought that fluoride was bad for me or anything else that was in the water.
[03:54:23.303 --> 03:54:26.424]  Of course, you do the research, you find out, well, it's shocking, folks.
[03:54:26.444 --> 03:54:27.185]  I'll just leave it at that.
[03:54:27.205 --> 03:54:28.685]  You'll never want to drink out of the tap again.
[03:54:29.285 --> 03:54:31.626]  But the X2, you can use it.
[03:54:31.786 --> 03:54:39.409]  It gets the iodine that you need back in your system and it helps fight the calcification of your pineal gland, which is essentially your third eye.
[03:54:39.549 --> 03:54:40.290]  It can open up.
[03:54:40.610 --> 03:54:43.291]  I'm telling you, the pineal gland is your soul.
[03:54:44.215 --> 03:54:48.436]  You can feel your spirit, you can feel your soul when your pineal gland is activated.
[03:54:48.456 --> 03:54:50.977]  That was your secret weapon against Carl the Cook, huh?
[03:54:51.817 --> 03:54:52.837]  Alright folks, there it is.
[03:54:53.397 --> 03:54:54.097]  Joe Biggs!
[03:54:54.477 --> 03:54:55.498]  I've uncovered the secret!
[03:54:55.538 --> 03:54:58.018]  That's how you were able to take on Abe Skrillex and Carl the Cook!
[03:54:58.218 --> 03:55:00.459]  Joe Biggs just outed me here, on the air.
[03:55:01.259 --> 03:55:02.259]  It's true, folks.
[03:55:02.439 --> 03:55:03.739]  That was your battle axe, man.
[03:55:03.839 --> 03:55:05.540]  It's like you're Thor.
[03:55:07.180 --> 03:55:12.764]  Survival Shield X2 was the secret weapon for me in battling the liberals in the streets.
[03:55:12.824 --> 03:55:13.244]  It is true.
[03:55:13.284 --> 03:55:16.386]  So, if you want the power, Survival Shield X2.
[03:55:16.626 --> 03:55:17.887]  Okay, so we're going to take the calls.
[03:55:18.047 --> 03:55:19.028]  We're going to clear this board.
[03:55:19.348 --> 03:55:21.129]  We're going to sing a little song, a little jingle.
[03:55:21.429 --> 03:55:23.290]  Does everyone in the back have your lyrics too?
[03:55:23.491 --> 03:55:24.651]  Daria just brought them all in.
[03:55:24.691 --> 03:55:25.592]  Does everyone have their lyrics?
[03:55:25.612 --> 03:55:26.593]  Who's ever going to sing with me?
[03:55:27.293 --> 03:55:28.834]  We're all singing.
[03:55:28.934 --> 03:55:30.175]  We're all going to sing this song.
[03:55:30.515 --> 03:55:32.957]  We're going to hijack the World Series for the Cubs.
[03:55:33.797 --> 03:55:35.378]  All right, let's take these final callers.
[03:55:35.418 --> 03:55:38.080]  They've been so kind to wait for us to take them.
[03:55:38.100 --> 03:55:40.422]  Let's start off with Joe in North Carolina.
[03:55:40.462 --> 03:55:41.062]  Go ahead, Joe.
[03:55:41.082 --> 03:55:46.026]  All right, do we still have Joe?
[03:55:46.066 --> 03:55:46.606]  You there, Joe?
[03:55:49.008 --> 03:55:49.188]  No.
[03:55:50.589 --> 03:55:57.874]  All right, guys, let's try to get Dylan potted up from New Jersey, since we no longer have Joe.
[03:55:57.894 --> 03:56:00.816]  All right, Dylan, do we have Dylan?
[03:56:00.856 --> 03:56:01.156]  You hear me?
[03:56:01.376 --> 03:56:01.997]  Yeah, go ahead, Dylan.
[03:56:03.195 --> 03:56:03.575]  Awesome.
[03:56:03.655 --> 03:56:04.335]  How you doing guys?
[03:56:05.476 --> 03:56:05.836]  Awesome.
[03:56:05.956 --> 03:56:07.056]  Crazy, crazy world.
[03:56:07.116 --> 03:56:09.517]  I had two points that I needed to make.
[03:56:09.657 --> 03:56:13.258]  I actually own a non-profit charity.
[03:56:13.318 --> 03:56:14.199]  I throw concerts.
[03:56:14.339 --> 03:56:21.961]  In the last two months, I have traveled the majority of this entire North America, from Canada down to Tijuana.
[03:56:22.722 --> 03:56:24.062]  I've done a lot of traveling.
[03:56:24.082 --> 03:56:25.783]  I've seen the majority of this country.
[03:56:25.823 --> 03:56:32.505]  And let me tell you, besides New York, besides Los Angeles, where people are basically brain dead, to be honest.
[03:56:33.200 --> 03:56:37.583]  And the whole world will know if they try to steal it.
[03:56:37.603 --> 03:56:38.223]  And that's exactly why.
[03:57:03.693 --> 03:57:12.597]  Again, you know, Joe talked about this earlier, how they try to demoralize you by pushing all these fake polls all day long, telling you Trump's losing, telling you Trump's racist, this false narrative.
[03:57:13.377 --> 03:57:17.759]  But we know if you just avoid the propaganda, it's easy to not fall for it.
[03:57:17.799 --> 03:57:18.800]  But you can't help it.
[03:57:18.840 --> 03:57:19.860]  It's human psychology.
[03:57:19.900 --> 03:57:22.561]  When it's just shoved in your face all day long, there's a certain acceptance.
[03:57:22.901 --> 03:57:25.142]  But all it is, is it's done to demoralize us.
[03:57:26.943 --> 03:57:34.708]  People will know, that's why it will be the shot heard around the world, because everybody around the world will know that they stole this election from Donald Trump.
[03:57:34.728 --> 03:57:36.029]  Thank you so much for the call, Dylan.
[03:57:36.049 --> 03:57:37.050]  Sorry to keep you waiting all night.
[03:57:37.070 --> 03:57:38.171]  We gotta pump through these callers.
[03:57:38.471 --> 03:57:41.373]  Let's go to Sharon in North Carolina now.
[03:57:41.413 --> 03:57:42.153]  Go ahead, Sharon.
[03:57:43.034 --> 03:57:43.514]  Hey, Owen.
[03:57:43.554 --> 03:57:44.015]  Hey, Joe.
[03:57:44.595 --> 03:57:45.375]  Hey, how's it going?
[03:57:46.596 --> 03:57:47.497]  It's going great.
[03:57:47.957 --> 03:57:48.498]  Awesome.
[03:57:50.039 --> 03:57:50.919]  It is.
[03:57:51.239 --> 03:57:52.640]  I wanted to make a point, two points.
[03:57:52.820 --> 03:57:54.041]  One was about Loretta Lynch.
[03:57:55.686 --> 03:58:00.949]  With all these WikiLeaks and everything going on, you know, it's up to her to convene a grand jury.
[03:58:01.529 --> 03:58:05.071]  And I can't see her doing that before Inauguration Day.
[03:58:06.252 --> 03:58:10.954]  So it'll be up to Trump to do it, which is fine because he's going to win.
[03:58:11.514 --> 03:58:14.996]  And I live in a little town in North Carolina, and you probably know what I'm talking about, Joe.
[03:58:15.076 --> 03:58:15.997]  What little town?
[03:58:16.817 --> 03:58:17.297]  Saluda.
[03:58:17.578 --> 03:58:20.259]  It's just outside of Asheville.
[03:58:21.039 --> 03:58:24.121]  And like most of this town is voting for Trump.
[03:58:24.727 --> 03:58:25.948]  But they're not telling anybody.
[03:58:27.008 --> 03:58:30.050]  Because you get a bunch of crap when you mention that.
[03:58:30.530 --> 03:58:31.431]  Voter suppression?
[03:58:31.591 --> 03:58:34.993]  I mean, just how crazy is that?
[03:58:35.013 --> 03:58:36.093]  I don't know.
[03:58:36.133 --> 03:58:44.418]  We live in an age where people are so, like, they feel threatened to just be honest about who they like because of the backlash.
[03:58:44.478 --> 03:58:47.940]  But they tell you you're the one that's doing the threatening!
[03:58:47.960 --> 03:58:49.541]  I know.
[03:58:49.561 --> 03:58:49.621]  Wow!
[03:58:49.701 --> 03:58:51.082]  Last night, for example, wow.
[03:58:52.082 --> 03:58:53.503]  I've been a lifelong Democrat.
[03:58:54.011 --> 03:58:56.433]  And I haven't voted in a lot of elections lately.
[03:58:56.473 --> 03:58:57.074]  I just couldn't.
[03:58:57.634 --> 03:59:04.680]  And when Trump came on board, and I have a lot of friends that are in the know, I mean, we're all voting for Trump.
[03:59:04.700 --> 03:59:05.881]  We're all talking about it.
[03:59:07.522 --> 03:59:08.963]  But a lot of Democrats aren't.
[03:59:09.624 --> 03:59:10.004]  They really aren't.
[03:59:10.024 --> 03:59:10.324]  There you go.
[03:59:10.344 --> 03:59:11.605]  Lifelong Democrats for Trump.
[03:59:11.625 --> 03:59:12.786]  We got one on the phone right now.
[03:59:13.567 --> 03:59:14.307]  Yes, you do.
[03:59:15.048 --> 03:59:16.569]  And go Trump.
[03:59:16.669 --> 03:59:19.892]  I mean, the man does have gold cojones.
[03:59:20.292 --> 03:59:22.254]  And we are going like crazy.
[03:59:22.314 --> 03:59:22.974]  Tonight showed that.
[03:59:24.577 --> 03:59:27.858]  Yes, we're going on our web pages like crazy to support him.
[03:59:28.518 --> 03:59:34.719]  Another thing, Owen was asked by Alex tonight what he thought, you know, could be worse than what we've seen.
[03:59:35.399 --> 03:59:39.940]  I think the spider web that she's been involved in and the corruption, the pedophilia.
[03:59:40.460 --> 03:59:48.342]  We had a guy in the next town over and his child was taken away from him and he went to go see the child and the child's gone with no explanation.
[03:59:48.602 --> 03:59:49.222]  It's just gone.
[03:59:50.222 --> 03:59:53.523]  So I think killing children and the size of the spider web
[03:59:54.137 --> 03:59:55.991]  Is really what could undo a lot of things.
[03:59:57.032 --> 03:59:57.992]  It's going to be crazy.
[03:59:58.092 --> 04:00:01.113]  We've got just a few days left, just a few hours left.
[04:00:01.193 --> 04:00:04.773]  WikiLeaks dumps are just getting more powerful and more powerful.
[04:00:05.133 --> 04:00:05.453]  Who knows?
[04:00:05.493 --> 04:00:08.914]  I mean, like I said earlier, we didn't even fully digest the Project Veritas videos.
[04:00:09.234 --> 04:00:11.074]  Who knows what else they got up their sleeve?
[04:00:11.094 --> 04:00:17.815]  Thank you so much for the call, Tina, a lifelong Democrat that will be voting for Donald Trump out of North Carolina, Joe Big's hometown.
[04:00:17.836 --> 04:00:22.576]  All right, let's take our final call of the night, this Saturday night special.
[04:00:22.616 --> 04:00:23.516]  Thanks to everybody who tuned in.
[04:00:23.556 --> 04:00:26.297]  Let's go to Tina, who is here in Texas.
[04:00:27.318 --> 04:00:28.118]  Hey, guys.
[04:00:28.138 --> 04:00:29.679]  Hey there, Tina.
[04:00:30.400 --> 04:00:33.622]  Thank you so much for the job that you do.
[04:00:33.642 --> 04:00:36.183]  Well, thank you for your support.
[04:00:36.964 --> 04:00:40.726]  Well, believe me, I'm proud to do it.
[04:00:41.026 --> 04:00:55.034]  I was a big, big Bernie fan and a lot in part to y'all's reporting about the DNC robbing him of the nomination and me just continuing to listen to your program.
[04:00:57.415 --> 04:01:03.703]  And opening my mind to the fact that Trump wasn't the monster he's been portrayed to be.
[04:01:03.763 --> 04:01:12.314]  Last week when I voted, early voted here in Texas, Trump got my vote because we Dancer don't want Hillary in there.
[04:01:14.090 --> 04:01:20.636]  Yeah, I think that that is well understood by most people, despite what they try to tell you in the polls.
[04:01:21.236 --> 04:01:26.541]  Thank you so much for your call, Tina, who was a former Bernie supporter, who will be supporting Trump.
[04:01:26.561 --> 04:01:30.185]  So, our last two callers tonight, two Democrats that will be voting for Trump.
[04:01:31.105 --> 04:01:37.651]  Other than the Bush family, I don't think I know any Republicans that are going to be voting for Hillary Clinton.
[04:01:37.671 --> 04:01:38.111]  Joe Biggs.
[04:01:38.451 --> 04:01:39.532]  Hold on, I got one big thing.
[04:01:39.953 --> 04:01:53.084]  So I'm getting word right now that Laura Sillsby, the woman, Hillary's friend who's been busted for trafficking Haitian kids, is actually connected, get this, to the Amber Alert system.
[04:01:54.522 --> 04:01:59.045]  Like she like has actual amber alert system that comes up on everyone's phone to go for missing kids.
[04:01:59.506 --> 04:02:01.127]  She is somehow working with that.
[04:02:01.807 --> 04:02:03.428]  Do you know what the connection is yet?
[04:02:04.049 --> 04:02:14.516]  They're saying right now that she has connections associated with MyStateUSA in Idaho, a corporation based in Meridian that actually runs that whole setup.
[04:02:14.537 --> 04:02:16.198]  So whenever kids go or whatever like that.
[04:02:16.638 --> 04:02:18.880]  So that's pretty crazy if she's really.
[04:02:19.420 --> 04:02:26.186]  Well, they just came out in Texas and they said the Texas CPS system is totally just disgusting.
[04:02:26.506 --> 04:02:28.848]  And they said it doesn't even help these kids.
[04:02:28.928 --> 04:02:32.872]  We're harming more kids than we're helping and it's endemic in the system.
[04:02:32.992 --> 04:02:38.236]  So it's not made to help these kids, it's just made to bring kids into the system so they get more money for the system.
[04:02:38.657 --> 04:02:39.337]  Rob Dew, everyone?
[04:02:39.658 --> 04:02:40.959]  Yeah, Rob Dew, News Director here.
[04:02:42.640 --> 04:02:43.881]  I've got a couple final things we'll do.
[04:02:43.941 --> 04:02:48.664]  We'll go around the table to see final words before we do our hijacking of the Cubs World Series.
[04:02:49.384 --> 04:02:58.370]  First thing for me, if the government is not going to follow the election law, which we know is the case here in Texas, know your rights, folks.
[04:02:59.011 --> 04:03:01.212]  You are well within your right to do exit polls.
[04:03:01.852 --> 04:03:02.533]  Know your rights.
[04:03:02.713 --> 04:03:08.116]  If the election officials come out and try to bully you, all you've got to do is tell them your rights and they'll back away.
[04:03:08.156 --> 04:03:09.978]  They don't think you know their rights.
[04:03:10.318 --> 04:03:11.659]  They don't even know their own rights.
[04:03:12.239 --> 04:03:13.800]  So tell them you're right and they'll back off.
[04:03:29.611 --> 04:03:29.771]  Yep.
[04:03:29.931 --> 04:03:34.972]  But you don't hear that about Democrat committees areas being attacked.
[04:03:35.012 --> 04:03:36.452]  You don't see signs being defaced.
[04:03:36.492 --> 04:03:43.834]  You see people are making it a game now to protect their signs with like electricity or nails and they're catching people in the act trying to steal signs.
[04:03:43.934 --> 04:03:44.294]  It's ridiculous.
[04:03:44.314 --> 04:03:47.654]  How many Trump supporters are running and tearing up Hillary Clinton signs?
[04:03:48.014 --> 04:03:55.636]  How many Trump supporters are going to Hillary Clinton rallies and running and charging the stages to go after and potentially assassinate her?
[04:03:55.976 --> 04:03:56.476]  Nobody!
[04:03:56.636 --> 04:04:00.839]  We don't even, we don't even go, we're law abiding, just like law abiding gun owners.
[04:04:01.019 --> 04:04:02.000]  We follow the law.
[04:04:02.040 --> 04:04:12.888]  Trump supporters are smart, small business owners, people who are entrepreneurs, intelligent, hardworking, who actually care, who listen to the law, who actually know what America stands for.
[04:04:13.108 --> 04:04:19.533]  They're not, they're not, they don't have the time to go run around and tear up people's signs, to go to rallies and harass other candidates.
[04:04:19.753 --> 04:04:22.135]  They just want to make America great again, plain and simple.
[04:04:22.235 --> 04:04:25.938]  And think about this, we've got all of this corruption that we could protest.
[04:04:26.218 --> 04:04:26.878]  Hillary Clinton on.
[04:04:27.118 --> 04:04:30.720]  Actual facts, actual knowledge that we know is going on.
[04:04:30.780 --> 04:04:31.681]  We could be protesting.
[04:04:31.921 --> 04:04:33.962]  We don't protest her events!
[04:04:34.042 --> 04:04:37.864]  Like Joe said, we got better stuff to do and a protest isn't going to do anything at the end of the day.
[04:04:37.904 --> 04:04:39.364]  Anyway, this is our protest.
[04:04:40.065 --> 04:04:43.846]  Getting facts and truth out there so that the American voter can be informed.
[04:04:44.187 --> 04:04:45.007]  Well, how about this?
[04:04:45.247 --> 04:04:49.229]  Clinton amnesty tax is going to cost $15,000 per household.
[04:04:49.249 --> 04:04:50.150]  Yeah, I saw that.
[04:04:50.470 --> 04:04:52.831]  $1.2 trillion as amnesty for illegal immigrants.
[04:04:53.511 --> 04:04:55.993]  Oh, you still want to... ...by Democrat Hillary Clinton.
[04:04:56.113 --> 04:04:56.654]  Is that PC?
[04:04:56.794 --> 04:04:57.234]  Is it PC?
[04:04:57.254 --> 04:05:03.259]  We require an immediate tax hike of $1.2 trillion, $15,000 per household.
[04:05:03.299 --> 04:05:04.199]  Right there, right off the bat.
[04:05:04.399 --> 04:05:06.661]  And look at what that policy has done... That's what she's going to do for you, people.
[04:05:06.721 --> 04:05:08.322]  And look at what that policy has done in Europe.
[04:05:08.382 --> 04:05:08.903]  We covered it.
[04:05:10.004 --> 04:05:10.884]  It's a failing policy.
[04:05:10.904 --> 04:05:13.927]  Do you guys have... There's a lot of dumbasses out there in Austin that are going to vote for her.
[04:05:14.167 --> 04:05:15.368]  Any final words, Joe Biggs?
[04:05:16.752 --> 04:05:18.833]  Just don't be discouraged by these.
[04:05:19.213 --> 04:05:20.854]  There's so many fake polls out there.
[04:05:20.994 --> 04:05:29.159]  Understand that we have the numbers, we have the power, we have one of the largest movements in my lifetime that I've ever seen.
[04:05:29.179 --> 04:05:35.002]  I've never seen people so enthusiastic, so happy, so amped up about politics.
[04:05:36.843 --> 04:05:38.244]  Just don't be fooled.
[04:05:38.885 --> 04:05:40.726]  Don't spread false information either.
[04:05:41.387 --> 04:05:47.332]  When you see someone post something on Facebook like a WikiLeak, go to WikiLeaks first and make sure it's a real WikiLeak before you share it.
[04:05:47.652 --> 04:05:53.357]  We don't need any fake stuff being spread around that's going to hurt our movement, hurt the information we're trying to get out.
[04:05:53.397 --> 04:05:56.260]  So when we do post real stuff, it doesn't take away from that.
[04:05:56.300 --> 04:06:01.424]  So be smart, be vigilant, and be out there and understand, like I said, we have the numbers, we can do this.
[04:06:02.205 --> 04:06:07.568]  Alright folks, that's Joe Biggs, Rob Dues joined us in studio, Ashley Beckford has also joined us in studio.
[04:06:07.688 --> 04:06:08.609]  For the song!
[04:06:08.629 --> 04:06:10.070]  Did you come here just to sing this song?
[04:06:10.090 --> 04:06:10.830]  Of course.
[04:06:11.451 --> 04:06:18.375]  So here's the deal folks, so this is the deal, Alex Jones challenged us to hijack the Chicago Cubs World Series.
[04:06:18.955 --> 04:06:21.316]  Now have any of you actually heard the song Go Cubs Go?
[04:06:21.456 --> 04:06:21.637]  No.
[04:06:22.137 --> 04:06:23.498]  Go Cubs Go!
[04:06:24.018 --> 04:06:24.718]  Yeah, kind of.
[04:06:24.838 --> 04:06:26.319]  I bet, is Matt in there?
[04:06:28.100 --> 04:06:29.801]  Matt, I'm sure you know the song.
[04:06:29.881 --> 04:06:30.622]  Do you know the song, Matt?
[04:06:31.806 --> 04:06:33.267]  Go Cubs Go!
[04:06:33.507 --> 04:06:33.927]  Go!
[04:06:34.027 --> 04:06:35.448]  Yeah, yeah, so that's the song.
[04:06:35.588 --> 04:06:36.529]  And then we're going to sing off-key.
[04:06:36.589 --> 04:06:38.890]  I used to think it was Blow Cubs Blow.
[04:06:39.951 --> 04:06:41.772]  Well, it was until they apparently won the World Series.
[04:06:41.792 --> 04:06:43.573]  Do you guys want to hear it first before we sing it?
[04:06:43.653 --> 04:06:43.893]  No, no, no.
[04:06:43.933 --> 04:06:44.974]  You just ready to go right in?
[04:06:45.054 --> 04:06:45.454]  I've heard it.
[04:06:45.534 --> 04:06:48.356]  So I'll just embarrass myself here on air.
[04:06:48.456 --> 04:06:51.038]  Trust me, I'm no vocalist, but I wrote this song.
[04:06:51.338 --> 04:06:55.280]  I'm not a professional musician, but we're going to hijack the Cubs winning the World Series.
[04:06:55.561 --> 04:06:58.162]  This is the remix to Go Cubs Go.
[04:06:58.182 --> 04:06:59.983]  I hope everybody sings this with me.
[04:07:00.404 --> 04:07:00.764]  Here we go.
[04:07:03.905 --> 04:07:06.668]  I don't want to embarrass myself.
[04:07:06.688 --> 04:07:06.768]  See?
[04:07:06.788 --> 04:07:07.228]  Kind of trendy.
[04:07:08.229 --> 04:07:08.950]  Jack that up!
[04:07:11.432 --> 04:07:13.974]  Election season's underway.
[04:07:15.916 --> 04:07:18.658]  Well, you better get ready for a brand new day.
[04:07:18.678 --> 04:07:19.899]  Hey!
[04:07:21.040 --> 04:07:23.503]  Hey, America, what do you say?
[04:07:23.523 --> 04:07:28.207]  Trump is gonna win today.
[04:07:29.670 --> 04:07:32.070]  They're singing, Go Trump, Go!
[04:07:32.951 --> 04:07:34.711]  Go Trump, Go!
[04:07:35.431 --> 04:07:37.611]  Hey America, what do you say?
[04:07:37.631 --> 04:07:40.052]  Trump is gonna win today!
[04:07:40.072 --> 04:07:42.332]  Go Trump, Go!
[04:07:42.352 --> 04:07:43.332]  Go Trump, Go!
[04:07:45.013 --> 04:07:47.213]  Hey America, what do you say?
[04:07:47.233 --> 04:07:49.694]  Trump is gonna win today!
[04:07:49.714 --> 04:07:51.954]  He's got the power, he's got the speed!
[04:07:51.974 --> 04:07:53.754]  Singing the whole song!
[04:07:54.294 --> 04:07:57.095]  To be the presidential nominee!
[04:07:59.133 --> 04:08:09.041]  Well, this is the year and Trump is the man to make America great again!
[04:08:09.161 --> 04:08:10.883]  Go Trump, go!
[04:08:11.603 --> 04:08:13.385]  Go Trump, go!
[04:08:14.025 --> 04:08:16.327]  Hey America, what do you say?
[04:08:16.467 --> 04:08:18.609]  Trump is gonna win today!
[04:08:18.909 --> 04:08:20.670]  Go Trump, go!
[04:08:21.290 --> 04:08:23.230]  Go Trump, go!
[04:08:23.830 --> 04:08:26.111]  Hey America, what do you say?
[04:08:26.231 --> 04:08:28.351]  Trump is gonna win today!
[04:08:28.412 --> 04:08:31.072]  Time to vote is here again!
[04:08:33.153 --> 04:08:36.093]  You can catch it all at the polling station!
[04:08:37.994 --> 04:08:40.915]  So move your feet and move your hands!
[04:08:42.795 --> 04:08:45.636]  Says Hillary Clinton to present!
[04:08:47.972 --> 04:08:49.673]  Go Trump Go!
[04:08:50.333 --> 04:08:52.114]  Go Trump Go!
[04:08:52.795 --> 04:08:55.056]  Hey America, what do you say?
[04:08:55.136 --> 04:08:57.358]  Trump is gonna win today!
[04:08:57.578 --> 04:08:59.199]  Go Trump Go!
[04:08:59.219 --> 04:09:02.181]  Go Trump Go!
[04:09:02.241 --> 04:09:04.663]  Hey America, what do you say?
[04:09:04.723 --> 04:09:06.584]  Trump is gonna win today!
[04:09:06.644 --> 04:09:08.465]  Go Trump Go!
[04:09:08.505 --> 04:09:09.546]  Go Trump Go!
[04:09:12.091 --> 04:09:14.432]  Hey America, what do you say?
[04:09:14.532 --> 04:09:16.773]  Trump is gonna win today!
[04:09:16.893 --> 04:09:18.253]  Go Trump, go!
[04:09:18.434 --> 04:09:20.874]  Go Trump, go!
[04:09:20.955 --> 04:09:23.976]  Hey America, what do you say?
[04:09:24.096 --> 04:09:26.097]  Trump is gonna win today!
[04:09:26.197 --> 04:09:27.117]  Go Trump, go!
[04:09:27.297 --> 04:09:29.478]  Don't give in to the pedophile network!
[04:09:29.738 --> 04:09:31.038]  Hillary for prison!
[04:09:31.098 --> 04:09:33.599]  Don't vote for people who go for spirit cooking!
[04:09:33.699 --> 04:09:35.820]  Trump is gonna win today!
[04:09:36.521 --> 04:09:38.301]  Hi everybody!
[04:09:38.461 --> 04:09:39.542]  Go Trump, go!
[04:09:40.743 --> 04:10:03.179]  People should not be afraid of their governments.
[04:10:03.419 --> 04:10:05.801]  Governments should be afraid of anything.
[04:10:27.535 --> 04:10:38.509]  Several party members have been murdered.
[04:10:46.281 --> 04:10:50.465]  We're interrupting your regularly scheduled program to bring you this terrifying report.
[04:10:50.545 --> 04:10:52.987]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[04:10:53.567 --> 04:10:55.129]  It just pancaked.
[04:10:55.569 --> 04:10:59.352]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[04:10:59.593 --> 04:11:02.335]  New York, very much a city still in chaos.
[04:11:02.375 --> 04:11:06.639]  The phones are not working properly, the subway lines are not working properly.
[04:11:06.679 --> 04:11:11.483]  The sky now blank with smoke in front of us, just across the Tigris River here.
[04:11:12.023 --> 04:11:16.064]  This is shock and awe, Tom, to the population of Baghdad.
[04:11:16.984 --> 04:11:18.725]  Shock and awe, indeed.
[04:11:19.185 --> 04:11:24.706]  The people you liberate will witness the honorable and decent spirit of the American military.
[04:11:25.166 --> 04:11:28.127]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[04:11:28.567 --> 04:11:29.087]  Come on!
[04:11:31.348 --> 04:11:32.728]  It is a big idea.
[04:11:32.748 --> 04:11:34.369]  A new world order.
[04:11:34.589 --> 04:11:35.349]  I love my dad.
[04:11:36.582 --> 04:11:37.823]  I'd kill for him.
[04:11:37.863 --> 04:11:39.805]  I'd go to prison for him because I love him so much.
[04:11:39.965 --> 04:11:40.806]  I love Bill Clinton.
[04:11:41.026 --> 04:11:43.429]  What does that make Hillary Clinton to the Bush family?
[04:11:44.170 --> 04:11:44.990]  My sister-in-law.
[04:11:45.070 --> 04:11:50.936]  When you are subverting the power of government, that's a fundamentally dangerous thing to democracy.
[04:11:50.956 --> 04:11:52.337]  What do you think of Edward Snowden?
[04:11:53.254 --> 04:11:54.035]  I think he's a traitor.
[04:11:54.295 --> 04:11:57.758]  Obama is the one that kills the US troops if the Russians bomb any of them.
[04:11:57.938 --> 04:11:59.820]  Obama is the one that put them in harm's way.
[04:11:59.940 --> 04:12:02.222]  Obama is the one using them as human shields.
[04:12:02.382 --> 04:12:06.645]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate, criminal government in American history.
[04:12:06.725 --> 04:12:07.706]  I'm here to warn people!
[04:12:07.726 --> 04:12:09.027]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[04:12:09.287 --> 04:12:10.208]  This isn't a game!
[04:12:12.210 --> 04:12:14.392]  Get out!
[04:12:14.552 --> 04:12:14.892]  Get out!
[04:12:14.912 --> 04:12:15.132]  Get out!
[04:12:15.192 --> 04:12:15.853]  Welcome to America, ISIS!
[04:12:15.873 --> 04:12:17.214]  This is what we do!
[04:12:17.494 --> 04:12:17.794]  Woo!
[04:12:18.914 --> 04:12:21.836]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[04:12:21.977 --> 04:12:23.678]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[04:12:23.698 --> 04:12:24.999]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[04:12:25.219 --> 04:12:34.827]  In 2012, your agency was saying, quote, the Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Al-Qaeda in Iraq are the major forces driving the insurgents in Syria.
[04:12:35.007 --> 04:12:35.888]  In 2012, the U.S.
[04:12:35.908 --> 04:12:38.690]  was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups.
[04:12:39.190 --> 04:12:40.111]  Why did you not stop that?
[04:12:40.131 --> 04:12:41.432]  Why didn't you come forward before?
[04:12:41.692 --> 04:12:42.793]  What were you waiting for?
[04:12:43.033 --> 04:12:46.116]  Well, for you, Inspector, I needed you.
[04:12:52.819 --> 04:12:56.123]  I suddenly had this feeling that everything was connected.
[04:12:56.244 --> 04:13:02.672]  We're all part of it.
[04:13:02.692 --> 04:13:03.713]  Are we ready for it?
[04:13:05.876 --> 04:13:10.722]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
