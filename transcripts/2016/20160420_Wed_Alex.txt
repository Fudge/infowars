[00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.790]  Wednesday, April 20th, 2016.
[00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.552]  You're about to hear some of the most powerful 9-11 inside information ever.
[00:00:21.492 --> 00:00:22.492]  Here's John Bowne's report.
[00:00:31.483 --> 00:00:32.284]  How should the U.S.
[00:00:32.324 --> 00:00:34.425]  respond to such a devastation?
[00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:37.146]  Well, I think they have to respond quickly and effectively.
[00:00:37.206 --> 00:00:44.270]  They have to find out exactly what the cause was, who did it, and they have to go after these people because there is no other choice.
[00:00:49.617 --> 00:00:54.442]  Obviously, the war in Iraq is a big, fat mistake, alright?
[00:00:54.763 --> 00:01:02.231]  It took Jeb Bush, took him five days before his people told him what to say, and he ultimately said it was a mistake.
[00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:07.296]  The war in Iraq, we spent two trillion dollars, thousands of lives, we don't even have it.
[00:01:07.597 --> 00:01:11.281]  Iran is taking over Iraq with the second largest oil reserves in the world.
[00:01:11.741 --> 00:01:13.361]  He's destabilized the Middle East.
[00:01:13.661 --> 00:01:26.104]  On Monday, the Obama administration and the State Department said the release of the papers detailing Saudi involvement in the 9-11 attacks and its support for al-Qaeda would damage U.S.
[00:01:26.204 --> 00:01:29.925]  national security and endanger citizens living abroad.
[00:01:30.225 --> 00:01:37.827]  Both the Obama and Bush administrations have refused to release the papers stored in a guarded vault beneath Washington, D.C.
[00:01:38.087 --> 00:01:41.208]  The FBI has also refused to unseal the documents
[00:01:41.488 --> 00:01:47.873]  It needs to be classified, former director of the FBI Robert S. Mueller said in a secret meeting.
[00:01:48.093 --> 00:01:52.736]  The White House has threatened to veto legislation that would release the documents.
[00:01:53.116 --> 00:01:56.759]  It's difficult to imagine a scenario where the president would sign it.
[00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.602]  White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Monday.
[00:02:00.942 --> 00:02:04.884]  He said the bill would jeopardize international sovereignty and put the U.S.
[00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:06.824]  at a significant risk.
[00:02:07.104 --> 00:02:17.208]  Obama allies on Capitol Hill, including an unnamed Republican senator, have vowed to prevent the Senate from taking up the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act.
[00:02:17.588 --> 00:02:25.691]  The bill would remove Saudi Arabia's immunity in federal court and allow victims of the 9-11 attacks to sue the kingdom.
[00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:26.171]  Governor Bush!
[00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:26.571]  How we doing?
[00:02:26.591 --> 00:02:27.072]  Good to see you, man.
[00:02:27.092 --> 00:02:27.412]  Alright, good.
[00:02:27.452 --> 00:02:27.752]  How you doing?
[00:02:28.492 --> 00:02:32.995]  I was wondering, would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted from the 9-11 commission report?
[00:02:33.055 --> 00:02:34.496]  Would you be willing to see those released?
[00:02:35.316 --> 00:02:36.137]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[00:02:36.177 --> 00:02:37.638]  You got them?
[00:02:37.678 --> 00:02:38.839]  Well, hopefully we can get them.
[00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:46.323]  In order to have the bill move forward, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would need to file procedural motions.
[00:02:46.343 --> 00:02:49.205]  60 votes are required to have the bill move forward.
[00:02:49.838 --> 00:02:56.927]  After 9-11, it was clear that the Congress was going to be called upon to conduct some form of an inquiry as to what happened.
[00:02:57.588 --> 00:03:05.237]  The decision by the leadership was to combine the intelligence committees of the House and the Senate into a single body.
[00:03:05.298 --> 00:03:08.702]  For the first time in the history of the Congress, that had occurred.
[00:03:09.062 --> 00:03:23.559]  On April 10th, the former chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and co-chair of the bipartisan Joint Congressional Inquiry into the 9-11 attacks, Bob Graham, told CBS News he believes Saudi Arabia was behind the attacks.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.683]  What I'm trying to tell you is, so what?
[00:03:27.484 --> 00:03:28.806]  We did not invent
[00:03:30.681 --> 00:03:31.382]  Uh, corruption.
[00:03:31.642 --> 00:03:37.085]  Graham said support came from the Saudi government, charities, and rich people in the country.
[00:03:37.345 --> 00:03:45.649]  He said that support was downplayed because of the special relationship between the United States and the Saudi Arabian Kingdom.
[00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:47.390]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:54.754]  For example, here's Donald Rumsfeld chomping at the bit to keep the momentum of the New World Order's tyrannical soft war moving.
[00:03:54.814 --> 00:03:58.356]  We haven't had an attack in five years.
[00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:05.639]  Building 7, I often hear about.
[00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:06.740]  No plane hit building 7.
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.400]  Why did building 7 come down?
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.240]  What do you tell people?
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.401]  What is building 7?
[00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:10.961]  Building 7.
[00:04:11.061 --> 00:04:11.941]  I have no idea.
[00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:13.821]  I've never heard that.
[00:04:26.385 --> 00:04:38.332]  We must never forget our fellow Americans that paid the ultimate price in a bid to end the American way, quarterbacked by a protected elite class now blackmailing the U.S.
[00:04:38.392 --> 00:04:42.994]  government by threatening to sell off $750 billion in U.S.
[00:04:43.135 --> 00:04:43.575]  assets.
[00:04:43.815 --> 00:04:49.018]  This obvious and inflated admission of guilt by the Saudis begs the question
[00:04:49.358 --> 00:04:56.145]  How much are the 2,996 innocent fellow American lives that perished on 9-11-2001 worth to you?
[00:04:56.185 --> 00:04:58.348]  What's going on, Betty?
[00:04:58.648 --> 00:04:59.849]  Betty, talk to me.
[00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:05.375]  Betty, are you there?
[00:05:05.796 --> 00:05:07.698]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:09.202]  We'll be back.
[00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:09.842]  Stay with us.
[00:05:10.703 --> 00:05:11.704]  Brain Force is here.
[00:05:12.244 --> 00:05:14.526]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:05:14.787 --> 00:05:22.614]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:05:23.396 --> 00:05:26.958]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:05:26.978 --> 00:05:29.320]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.203]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:05:33.263 --> 00:05:36.385]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:05:36.885 --> 00:05:41.708]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:44.070]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.813]  That is activated by the different compounds in the yerba mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:05:48.993 --> 00:05:51.015]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:05:51.616 --> 00:05:53.098]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:05:53.238 --> 00:05:53.498]  Exactly.
[00:05:53.518 --> 00:05:57.283]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:05:57.803 --> 00:06:05.793]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:06:10.615 --> 00:06:12.016]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:06:12.537 --> 00:06:18.461]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:32.853]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running 6 miles every other day, swimming 2-3 miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights
[00:06:33.433 --> 00:06:35.374]  You're focusing on fighting the globalists.
[00:06:35.755 --> 00:06:43.580]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:50.945]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:06:51.225 --> 00:06:56.949]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.

[00:07:10.257 --> 00:07:11.637]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:07:11.917 --> 00:07:13.198]  You can't survive without it.
[00:07:13.398 --> 00:07:14.319]  But where do you get it?
[00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:20.362]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:07:20.582 --> 00:07:26.325]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:07:26.485 --> 00:07:43.355]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:45.876]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:07:46.236 --> 00:07:47.437]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:07:47.697 --> 00:07:48.458]  Easy assembly.
[00:07:48.738 --> 00:07:49.378]  Low maintenance.
[00:07:49.658 --> 00:07:51.479]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:08:10.686 --> 00:08:15.536]  As a community moves towards despotism, respect is restricted to fewer people.
[00:08:18.419 --> 00:08:27.143]  That's veteran Denver Police Officer Charles Jones IV smashing an unarmed suspect in the face six times.
[00:08:27.623 --> 00:08:31.945]  Officers accused of using excessive force on a suspect and then trying to erase the evidence.
[00:08:32.005 --> 00:08:34.526]  I'm observing what they're doing and they don't see me.
[00:08:34.746 --> 00:08:36.867]  I don't understand what's going on.
[00:08:36.907 --> 00:08:46.271]  A community rates low on an information scale when the press, radio, and other channels of communication are controlled by only a few people.
[00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:54.652]  Does it raise ethical questions about the use of government money to produce stories about the government that wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were produced by the government?
[00:08:54.932 --> 00:08:56.492]  How can you ask such a question?
[00:08:56.512 --> 00:09:00.133]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:09:00.173 --> 00:09:06.495]  When a competent observer looks for signs of despotism in the community, he looks beyond fine words and noble phrases.
[00:09:06.515 --> 00:09:14.137]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.
[00:09:15.299 --> 00:09:17.260]  Tonight, I'm announcing those actions.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.641]  What I say, go.
[00:09:18.861 --> 00:09:19.081]  See?
[00:09:19.101 --> 00:09:21.483]  I'm the law around here.
[00:09:22.963 --> 00:09:26.666]  He came, you saw, you died.
[00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:37.632]  We just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:09:37.672 --> 00:09:44.634]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:09:45.094 --> 00:09:47.455]  We are trained to deceive if we have to.
[00:09:47.495 --> 00:09:48.975]  You really don't have to trust me.
[00:09:48.995 --> 00:09:49.796]  You shouldn't trust me.
[00:09:49.836 --> 00:09:53.317]  In fact, by my actually participating in that, I will taint the news.
[00:09:53.897 --> 00:09:57.158]  In communities of this kind, despotism stands a good chance.
[00:09:59.058 --> 00:10:05.044]  Nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[00:10:05.064 --> 00:10:08.247]  Okay, Miss Hughes, well, we're gonna do everything we can to help you.
[00:10:10.229 --> 00:10:13.713]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:10:14.333 --> 00:10:16.535]  It's The Alex Jones Show.
[00:10:16.996 --> 00:10:19.778]  Because there is a war on, for your mind.
[00:10:23.072 --> 00:10:28.894]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are seeing just amazing historical things happen every day now.
[00:10:30.354 --> 00:10:41.937]  The conspiratorial patriot, extreme right-wing view of the world is being documented to be the true state of the planet and how things operate.
[00:10:43.037 --> 00:10:46.758]  Now, I don't call it the extreme right-wing patriot movement.
[00:10:46.898 --> 00:10:48.759]  That's what the mainstream media calls it.
[00:10:50.151 --> 00:10:53.514]  We are a movement based in the United States, but allied across the world.
[00:10:53.814 --> 00:11:07.586]  There are patriots and pro-humans in parties in Africa, in parties in Asia, in parties in Europe, in parties in Central and South America, as well as North America and the Pacific Islands, right through to Australia.
[00:11:09.788 --> 00:11:10.749]  We study history.
[00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.472]  We study economics.
[00:11:16.206 --> 00:11:17.947]  We study empires.
[00:11:18.987 --> 00:11:20.628]  We study cartels.
[00:11:22.809 --> 00:11:23.650]  We are learned.
[00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:26.311]  We are informed.
[00:11:27.492 --> 00:11:28.672]  We are involved.
[00:11:29.533 --> 00:11:34.255]  We are empowered individuals, as the Pentagon calls us.
[00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:44.140]  And the Pentagon is tasked with going after its number one enemy, Jade Helm's own documents admitted, the empowered individual.
[00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:53.717]  Not a terrorist, not a criminal, but the empowered individual enlightened with a mind of renaissance.
[00:11:57.379 --> 00:12:09.729]  That individual will not fit in to this new robotic planetary dark age that the establishment is trying to foist upon us.
[00:12:12.073 --> 00:12:22.462]  But the spirit of liberty that beats in the human breast, the indomitable human spirit that refuses to submit, is beginning to rise.
[00:12:23.604 --> 00:12:35.975]  And just as the earth itself goes through birth pains, and just as tectonic activity rises to the highest level ever recorded, just as volcanoes begin to erupt,
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.661]  As above, so below.
[00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:44.262]  That's what the ancient alchemist said.
[00:12:45.583 --> 00:12:49.685]  And you're seeing that happen yet again in front of everyone.
[00:12:49.725 --> 00:12:51.186]  This is a great time of change.
[00:12:51.847 --> 00:12:54.769]  A lot of horrible things are going to happen in the next decade, obviously.
[00:12:55.569 --> 00:12:57.751]  But a lot of amazing things are going to happen as well.
[00:12:58.942 --> 00:13:02.745]  Humanity is entering its birthright of super-science.
[00:13:03.386 --> 00:13:09.190]  I use the 1900 term for comic book super-science, imaginary super-science.
[00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:17.857]  What was super-science a hundred years ago has been surpassed in almost every imagination of the mind of man.
[00:13:19.579 --> 00:13:20.600]  Quite a species!
[00:13:21.735 --> 00:13:23.435]  And that's why you've been told you're ugly.
[00:13:23.995 --> 00:13:25.616]  It's why you've been told you're a failure.
[00:13:26.156 --> 00:13:28.917]  It's why you've been told you're not beautiful and have no power.
[00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:37.598]  Because as Mahatma Gandhi said, in our heart, in each human, there is the seed of the universe.
[00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:43.080]  And that's what we're talking about here today.
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:49.381]  The globalists want to rob that seed, that potential of our destiny,
[00:13:50.871 --> 00:13:52.212]  And run for the hills with it.
[00:13:53.652 --> 00:13:58.054]  This is a mugging, a cosmic globalist mugging of our species.
[00:13:58.754 --> 00:14:00.735]  An attempt to harness our species.
[00:14:02.496 --> 00:14:03.276]  True slavery.
[00:14:04.977 --> 00:14:06.297]  Slavery to the next power.
[00:14:07.278 --> 00:14:08.558]  Slavery squared.
[00:14:10.719 --> 00:14:12.820]  Total control of reality.
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.661]  False paradigms.
[00:14:15.641 --> 00:14:16.882]  Programmed masses.
[00:14:20.134 --> 00:14:27.518]  Donald Trump, just a symbol of populism, a flawed one as all humans are, was able to have an election.
[00:14:27.758 --> 00:14:41.186]  The last five contests that the Republicans cancelled them and just gave all the votes to the anointed one, Ted Cruz, anointed by I guess our high priest, Glenn Beck, because he said so.
[00:14:42.495 --> 00:14:46.638]  He wears ironic sweaters to look non-threatening, so everything's fine when he creeps around.
[00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:47.518]  We must do what he says.
[00:14:47.978 --> 00:14:49.299]  Him and Count Chocula.
[00:14:49.319 --> 00:14:51.300]  I mean, excuse me, Ted Cruz.
[00:14:54.622 --> 00:15:01.927]  Trump actually got to have an election, and he dominated getting all the delegates in New York.
[00:15:04.414 --> 00:15:10.818]  Now, of course, Hillary was behind the polls in New York, but Bernie Sanders magically lost.
[00:15:10.878 --> 00:15:13.019]  And, of course, when he wins states, she gets the delegates.
[00:15:13.659 --> 00:15:24.966]  That's why Cruz just started having the Republicans cancel primaries all out, because if you have them and then give the delegates when Trump wins in Tennessee, Arizona, Louisiana, and a bunch of other states, it's a little bit embarrassing.
[00:15:24.986 --> 00:15:26.286]  You know, like in Wyoming was another one.
[00:15:28.868 --> 00:15:30.709]  So you just cancel things outright, like
[00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.350]  Like Colorado and now other states.
[00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:41.732]  And the problem is, is that they're not, they can't get the Republicans and the party machines in states like Pennsylvania and New York.
[00:15:42.652 --> 00:15:47.353]  They're just not agreeing to say there was never voters, they didn't exist and you're a kook if you say it.
[00:15:48.553 --> 00:15:52.494]  I saw this talking point starting three weeks ago and I played a lot of clips of it, made a big deal out of it.
[00:15:53.254 --> 00:15:59.976]  Because Cruz would go on national television and radio and say, the Texas Senator,
[00:16:02.742 --> 00:16:06.505]  I mean, I gotta say, at the Carpetbagging Center, I now do not accept Ted Cruz as a Texan.
[00:16:06.785 --> 00:16:07.406]  He's not from here.
[00:16:07.446 --> 00:16:08.247]  Nothing against Canadians.
[00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:08.967]  You got a great country.
[00:16:09.408 --> 00:16:14.492]  But, you know, just please, man, stop with the cowboy hats and the boots and making us all look bad, okay?
[00:16:15.993 --> 00:16:16.714]  I mean, seriously.
[00:16:18.515 --> 00:16:23.559]  I mean, you hand that guy a lariat, he'd think it was for hanging the Constitution by the neck until dead.
[00:16:23.579 --> 00:16:24.420]  He wouldn't know what to do with it.
[00:16:26.282 --> 00:16:28.684]  So there was a paradigm shift when Sean Hannity
[00:16:29.548 --> 00:16:30.971]  I've been a critic of him over the years.
[00:16:31.471 --> 00:16:32.473]  At least he's pro-gun and stuff.
[00:16:32.493 --> 00:16:33.555]  I'm not an enemy with him.
[00:16:33.575 --> 00:16:37.421]  I don't think he's duplicitous and sneaky like Glenn Beck.
[00:16:39.554 --> 00:16:40.995]  And I don't like to bash these people.
[00:16:41.615 --> 00:16:42.776]  I'm not in competition with them.
[00:16:43.537 --> 00:16:44.617]  I'm changing the narrative.
[00:16:44.757 --> 00:16:45.818]  I'm changing the talking points.
[00:16:46.118 --> 00:16:47.879]  They follow us, and that's a fact.
[00:16:48.339 --> 00:17:04.890]  We influence them and take their fake conservatism and bring it into true constitutional libertarianism because we educate the public to where they're forced to follow or become passé, become obsolete, become redundant, become vestigial, become ceremonial.
[00:17:06.769 --> 00:17:11.752]  Become empty if they don't follow because the truth is unstoppable.
[00:17:11.792 --> 00:17:15.394]  But to his credit, Hannity really got it.
[00:17:15.414 --> 00:17:16.595]  I'm going to play the clip coming up.
[00:17:17.255 --> 00:17:17.735]  Cruz is on.
[00:17:17.775 --> 00:17:19.697]  He goes, listen, man, you've been on my show more than anybody.
[00:17:20.297 --> 00:17:24.119]  And you keep playing this mind game where you talk about landslides in these terms.
[00:17:24.499 --> 00:17:26.000]  You've been canceling elections.
[00:17:26.961 --> 00:17:27.881]  And don't give me this.
[00:17:27.961 --> 00:17:28.942]  Nothing's going on.
[00:17:28.962 --> 00:17:30.403]  And voters aren't upset.
[00:17:30.463 --> 00:17:31.904]  My audience is really upset.
[00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:34.271]  We're gonna play the clip, but that's a paraphrase.
[00:17:34.911 --> 00:17:40.373]  And Cruz just keeps going, no, I want a landslide, I won, he's a sore loser, only Trump.
[00:17:40.473 --> 00:17:42.354]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[00:17:43.014 --> 00:17:49.516]  And to finally see Hannity go, Hannity goes, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.
[00:17:50.296 --> 00:18:02.021]  Because when someone's looking at you, insulting you, it's like if you're standing there at high noon outside and the sky's blue, and somebody goes, no, it's not, it's black, or it's purple.
[00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:06.137]  And you're like, no, it's an azure blue sky.
[00:18:06.457 --> 00:18:06.917]  Heavenly.
[00:18:08.418 --> 00:18:10.199]  And they look at it and they go, I say it's not.
[00:18:10.579 --> 00:18:31.591]  There comes a point where no matter how big your red carpet is, or how fancy your tuxedo is, or how slick you can talk, people just go, hey, the sky's blue, two plus two equals four, Obamacare's a ripoff, you are coming after our guns, the country's run by foreign banks, the Chinese communists lecture us and own our debt and tell us what to do, along with the Saudi Arabians who run slave brothels?
[00:18:32.739 --> 00:18:36.902]  They're lecturing us on human rights and they run the UN Human Rights Commission?
[00:18:37.362 --> 00:18:42.606]  Man, this is funnier than George Carlin, if it wasn't so serious!
[00:18:46.868 --> 00:18:55.954]  So, look, the world is going to decide that 2 plus 2 equals 4, or it's not, as Eric Blair, aka George Orwell, wrote in 1948, when he published 1984.
[00:19:00.592 --> 00:19:23.869]  What he believed it would be like if the socialists took over, they would destroy language, turn everything on its head, call tyranny love, create social justice warrior networks of young trendies running around, denouncing everyone, to have them drug off to re-education centers, because he'd worked for the British Secret Police, he'd been in MI6 and OSS, and he'd worked for the communists as well, as a commander in the Spanish Civil War fighting the Nazis.
[00:19:25.259 --> 00:19:30.602]  He wrote essay after essay, non-fiction, about how he figured out the communists were as bad as the Nazis.
[00:19:32.023 --> 00:19:38.247]  And how they didn't want to set up a nice world, they wanted to rape your wife and have you starve to death when they sat up in a castle.
[00:19:41.149 --> 00:19:43.330]  They want to stomp on your face because they like it.
[00:19:45.032 --> 00:19:47.293]  You ask, why does a pedophile want to grab your kid out of their backyard?
[00:19:47.393 --> 00:19:48.074]  It's horrible.
[00:19:48.274 --> 00:19:50.015]  Because you're not like them.
[00:19:52.523 --> 00:19:54.405]  You're attracted to a wonder woman.
[00:19:54.906 --> 00:19:55.566]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:19:56.147 --> 00:20:02.173]  Powerful, beautiful, creature made of God, reproductive, the feminine energy.
[00:20:02.193 --> 00:20:03.494]  That's what a real man's attracted to.
[00:20:03.675 --> 00:20:04.415]  Not these people.
[00:20:04.916 --> 00:20:07.919]  They want to grab your five-year-old out of the backyard and torture him to death.
[00:20:08.299 --> 00:20:08.640]  Okay?
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.561]  That's who they are.
[00:20:20.788 --> 00:20:46.086]  There was a mighty nation Blessed above all of creation It was a rare and precious pearl Conceived in faith and liberty Home of the brave, land of the free It was the envy of the world But this shining city on the hill Has turned from the Creator's will And let evil take control
[00:20:48.769 --> 00:20:55.596]  Now the reckless men who lead them Want to strip away their freedom And to steal their very souls
[00:20:58.126 --> 00:21:00.548]  Now it's smoke and mirrors, switching bait.
[00:21:01.008 --> 00:21:05.010]  Criticize and confiscate and let the guilty walk away.
[00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:07.392]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:21:07.452 --> 00:21:14.436]  In this once righteous, godly nation, in the halls of education, they forbid a child to pray.
[00:21:14.616 --> 00:21:17.238]  Our society is moving towards Marxism.
[00:21:17.278 --> 00:21:19.659]  They say we need to spread the wealth.
[00:21:19.719 --> 00:21:23.722]  They pretend to guard the health of the feeble and the poor.
[00:21:23.742 --> 00:21:25.083]  You can keep productive.
[00:21:26.243 --> 00:21:33.228]  While the hand they hold behind their back confuses and conceals the fact that the proof is at the door.
[00:21:33.288 --> 00:21:39.411]  There's an unseen hand that pulls the string.
[00:21:40.972 --> 00:21:44.715]  It makes his little puppets dance to every song he sings.
[00:21:44.935 --> 00:21:49.377]  It's a knife holding on a rising tide.
[00:21:50.438 --> 00:21:51.879]  Look beyond the shadows.
[00:21:53.663 --> 00:21:56.805]  Behold a pale horse ride.
[00:21:56.965 --> 00:21:58.046]  Something's wrong.
[00:21:58.586 --> 00:21:59.126]  We all know.
[00:21:59.447 --> 00:22:02.188]  They claim to seek a new world order.
[00:22:02.248 --> 00:22:03.809]  Nations without borders.
[00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:08.192]  But don't believe the lie.
[00:22:08.272 --> 00:22:15.297]  Even in this wealthy nation, it can come down to starvation and the twinkling of an eye.
[00:22:18.315 --> 00:22:45.768]  They tell us there will soon be peace Our lives will be at endless speed But they lead us toward the dark In the distance sabers rattle And the army's trained for battle As the beast repairs his mark There's an unseen hand That pulls the string And makes his little puppets dance To any song he sings
[00:22:54.741 --> 00:22:58.106]  Behold the pale horizon!
[00:22:58.166 --> 00:23:01.051]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces.
[00:23:01.732 --> 00:23:04.857]  The Dark Side bent on global governance.

[00:24:21.387 --> 00:24:27.670]  I'm looking at InfoWars.com right now.
[00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:29.651]  I'm also looking at DrugsReport.com.
[00:24:29.691 --> 00:24:31.332]  If you're a TV viewer, I'm going to point to it.
[00:24:31.993 --> 00:24:35.975]  Saudi Arabia borrows $10 billion as oil slump.
[00:24:39.277 --> 00:24:40.557]  Drains reserves.
[00:24:41.378 --> 00:24:43.419]  They supposedly have all these trillions, but they've got to borrow money.
[00:24:44.189 --> 00:24:51.391]  Because they've got more than 10,000 princes worth hundreds of millions or billions apiece, depending on which one you talk about, in all their little palaces.
[00:24:52.631 --> 00:24:56.932]  You always hear about these people worth, you know, $100 million, these boxers, and a year later, they're bankrupt.
[00:24:57.692 --> 00:24:59.393]  A fool and his money will soon be parted.
[00:24:59.753 --> 00:25:03.454]  Fresh evidence links Saudi Arabian government to 9-11.
[00:25:03.834 --> 00:25:04.534]  Mainstream news.
[00:25:04.554 --> 00:25:05.714]  We're going to get to those articles.
[00:25:07.155 --> 00:25:07.775]  Again, paper.
[00:25:08.375 --> 00:25:08.995]  National poll.
[00:25:09.015 --> 00:25:10.475]  Only 6% trust media.
[00:25:11.916 --> 00:25:12.976]  But it should be less.
[00:25:14.448 --> 00:25:18.951]  And then Politico founder says the death of the clicks is here.
[00:25:18.971 --> 00:25:35.382]  Yeah, I called in my sales staff for radio ads and click ads four and a half years ago, and I said, listen, I'm going to let three of you go, and I'm going to keep two of you.
[00:25:37.293 --> 00:25:42.377]  And I said, uh, I'm doing this because people have been fighting me on sponsorship.
[00:25:42.617 --> 00:25:46.520]  And I said, I will only take stuff that I endorse that I absolutely know is the best.
[00:25:47.681 --> 00:25:53.425]  And I have to hear constantly about how, um, you know, this is a pretty good sponsor.
[00:25:57.388 --> 00:25:58.508]  And I said, let me explain something.
[00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.412]  You're going to see the death of the clickbait.
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:13.926]  Everything is going to be about viral videos and news and analysis and people and sources that the population trusts.
[00:26:15.087 --> 00:26:16.668]  So credibility is everything.
[00:26:17.388 --> 00:26:19.190]  Not just to be successful, but to who I am.
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.461]  Now, I'm not a total purist, because you can't be.
[00:26:22.761 --> 00:26:29.823]  I'm on radio stations across this country airing local ads and things that I can't tell you're perfect, and I can't speak for them, and I'm not judging anybody.
[00:26:30.123 --> 00:26:35.564]  The network, quite frankly, has some ads, things that I can't speak for, but that's their ads, that's fine.
[00:26:35.764 --> 00:26:39.425]  Some are great, some, you know, probably not so great, I'll just be honest with you in my view.
[00:26:40.266 --> 00:26:42.586]  Nobody's perfect, but you gotta make a real effort.
[00:26:44.547 --> 00:26:45.787]  You gotta make a real effort.
[00:26:46.727 --> 00:26:49.028]  I'm not going into a plug here, I'm explaining my philosophy.
[00:26:51.363 --> 00:26:53.604]  That you better treat people like you want to be treated.
[00:26:54.124 --> 00:26:57.725]  I mean, that's... Man, I tell you, the Golden Rule really makes a lot of sense to me.
[00:27:02.966 --> 00:27:12.288]  And just like you're seeing the collapse of the media, the old dinosaur media, and just like you're seeing the collapse of the establishment and their attempt to reach into totalitarianism to save their program,
[00:27:15.438 --> 00:27:21.520]  They even convinced themselves that the collapse that was coming out of their predatory system would be good to consolidate control.
[00:27:22.941 --> 00:27:32.504]  But in truth, they're all greedy and backstabbing as well, and haven't even been following their own eugenics protocols, and this whole thing is going to spin out of control and explode.
[00:27:33.144 --> 00:27:39.066]  They think they can just follow the AI computer systems they've got and follow decisions off of trends?
[00:27:42.441 --> 00:27:48.385]  That only works if the people running the system actually let the artificial intelligences control it, but they don't.
[00:27:48.605 --> 00:27:57.570]  They're getting in there constantly trying to tweak it or change it to improve their combine's particular position.
[00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:03.393]  And so the combines more and more are at odds with each other and there's cracks forming in these alliances.
[00:28:03.994 --> 00:28:06.395]  I don't need an AI algorithm to tell me that.
[00:28:07.116 --> 00:28:08.817]  I got the one built over this
[00:28:09.935 --> 00:28:13.996]  Species development and all the experiences of my ancestors.
[00:28:14.996 --> 00:28:17.917]  I'll put that up against your supercomputer any day.
[00:28:19.077 --> 00:28:23.858]  Because I have morals and I have a compass and I have a rule.
[00:28:25.359 --> 00:28:28.260]  A social code I follow because it's written in my DNA.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.940]  That's the thing about evil people.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:38.062]  They think because they can cheat and steal and lie and do bad things and get ahead for a little while that they're advanced and intelligent.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:50.363]  They think really good people don't understand evil and don't understand all the things they know and more, and that we're weak because we won't use the type of tactics you use?
[00:28:50.723 --> 00:28:51.504]  You're fools.
[00:28:53.764 --> 00:28:55.865]  You're like someone that gets in the community pool.
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.683]  That's got 50 people swimming in it and starts urinating in it.
[00:29:01.624 --> 00:29:07.009]  Telling yourself that, oh, it's just me doing it, but then everybody else starts doing it.
[00:29:07.289 --> 00:29:08.250]  Or let's go on further.
[00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:11.473]  You start doing, not number one, but the other one in the pool.
[00:29:12.995 --> 00:29:14.196]  And that's what you guys are doing.
[00:29:14.296 --> 00:29:20.562]  You think it's not affecting you and your kids, and the pool looks like a latrine at this point.
[00:29:21.735 --> 00:29:24.576]  You people don't even care if nuclear reactors melt down now.
[00:29:24.796 --> 00:29:27.157]  You just turn the alarms off and let them leak.
[00:29:27.177 --> 00:29:32.220]  93% of them, the International Atomic Energy Commission admits, are leaking currently.
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.701]  They're just falling apart, melting down, exploding.
[00:29:36.362 --> 00:29:37.942]  They used to at least care.
[00:29:38.302 --> 00:29:38.983]  They don't care anymore.
[00:29:39.163 --> 00:29:41.204]  You people are disconnected.
[00:29:41.764 --> 00:29:46.885]  You've stolen trillions, you live in palaces, and you're disconnected from the grassroots.
[00:29:47.205 --> 00:29:47.845]  Well, I'm not.
[00:29:48.286 --> 00:29:52.827]  Oh, Politico, thank you for telling me that the click age is ending.
[00:29:53.207 --> 00:29:58.108]  We told you four years ago, we changed it into our own internal funded model.
[00:29:58.428 --> 00:29:59.668]  We are the trailblazers!
[00:29:59.688 --> 00:30:02.589]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.509 --> 00:30:06.190]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:11.141 --> 00:30:14.502]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:30:14.602 --> 00:30:16.863]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:30:17.043 --> 00:30:25.426]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:30:25.686 --> 00:30:29.027]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:30:29.187 --> 00:30:39.491]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:30:39.811 --> 00:30:47.096]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:30:47.296 --> 00:30:49.197]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:30:49.537 --> 00:30:57.102]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:30:57.482 --> 00:31:03.647]  Super Mill Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:31:03.947 --> 00:31:10.892]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mill Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:31:11.172 --> 00:31:21.359]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[00:31:21.559 --> 00:31:28.484]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:31:28.664 --> 00:31:33.347]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:31:33.527 --> 00:31:40.212]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:40.332 --> 00:31:47.417]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:31:47.497 --> 00:31:49.218]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[00:31:49.378 --> 00:31:54.360]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.861]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:31:59.001 --> 00:32:02.243]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:32:02.383 --> 00:32:08.505]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:32:08.685 --> 00:32:10.886]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:11.086 --> 00:32:14.067]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[00:32:14.347 --> 00:32:16.608]  Introducing Deep Cleanse by Infowarslife.com.

[00:33:08.434 --> 00:33:17.276]  Oh yeah, it's a cheesy song, but everybody knows they love it.
[00:33:17.296 --> 00:33:18.476]  So I'll admit, I don't think it's cheesy.
[00:33:18.516 --> 00:33:18.896]  I like it.
[00:33:19.276 --> 00:33:19.796]  Crank it up!
[00:33:19.816 --> 00:33:20.736]  It's the Eye of the Tiger!
[00:33:21.797 --> 00:33:21.917]  Ha!
[00:33:25.639 --> 00:33:30.600]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.120]  Pull up.
[00:33:34.841 --> 00:33:35.281]  Red light.
[00:33:35.321 --> 00:33:35.981]  Look over to the ladies.
[00:33:36.141 --> 00:33:37.761]  Of course, a married guy can't do that.
[00:33:38.621 --> 00:33:39.822]  It's the eye of the tiger, baby.
[00:33:41.822 --> 00:33:42.882]  Not acting confident.
[00:33:43.522 --> 00:33:45.063]  I am confident.
[00:33:45.123 --> 00:33:46.003]  Confident in the truth.
[00:33:46.823 --> 00:33:48.683]  Confident in my love of humanity.
[00:33:50.223 --> 00:33:50.904]  Rising up.
[00:33:52.604 --> 00:33:53.244]  Thrill of the fight.
[00:33:56.815 --> 00:33:57.676]  Yeah, let's play some of this.
[00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:01.799]  I did, I did my time, I took my chances.
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:10.206]  I want to salute all the patriots out there that exposed 9-11 as an inside job.
[00:34:11.106 --> 00:34:13.428]  You've been vindicated, yet again.
[00:34:13.448 --> 00:34:15.610]  Federal reserves, private.
[00:34:16.571 --> 00:34:17.111]  Vindicated.
[00:34:17.812 --> 00:34:19.333]  Stock markets, everything rigged.
[00:34:20.073 --> 00:34:20.654]  Vindicated.
[00:34:21.855 --> 00:34:25.818]  Cancer viruses in the polio vaccines, now globally recalled.
[00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:27.706]  Vindicated!
[00:34:28.946 --> 00:34:30.928]  Fluoride, brain-damaging people en masse!
[00:34:31.228 --> 00:34:31.848]  Vindicated!
[00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:33.510]  Vindicated!
[00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:38.373]  Pro-human, anti-eugenics, humans of the stars and beyond!
[00:34:38.874 --> 00:34:39.494]  Vindicated!
[00:34:40.174 --> 00:34:41.135]  Committed to win!
[00:34:41.816 --> 00:34:42.476]  Vindicated!
[00:34:42.916 --> 00:34:43.617]  Spirit of 1776 rising!
[00:34:43.657 --> 00:34:44.117]  Vindicated!
[00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:53.292]  That toast is with coffee.
[00:34:53.312 --> 00:34:54.274]  They say that's not good luck.
[00:34:54.294 --> 00:34:54.755]  Yeah, it is.
[00:34:55.857 --> 00:34:58.362]  We're toasting to the big wake-up that's happening right now.
[00:35:01.101 --> 00:35:02.022]  I'm gonna be honest with you.
[00:35:02.062 --> 00:35:04.284]  I say this broadcast isn't teleprompter free.
[00:35:06.385 --> 00:35:07.726]  It is teleprompter free.
[00:35:08.767 --> 00:35:10.409]  But it is guided by something else.
[00:35:10.749 --> 00:35:11.570]  Human will.
[00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:16.494]  And a script written thousands of years ago.
[00:35:17.575 --> 00:35:19.656]  It's the same fight every generation goes through.
[00:35:20.197 --> 00:35:22.379]  But this one is the key crossroads.
[00:35:22.799 --> 00:35:24.961]  The gateway to the future.
[00:35:27.182 --> 00:35:28.825]  He's the eye of the tiger right now.
[00:35:28.865 --> 00:35:29.586]  The commitment.
[00:35:30.207 --> 00:35:31.389]  It isn't thinking about winning.
[00:35:31.689 --> 00:35:32.630]  It's going to win.
[00:35:38.359 --> 00:35:39.902]  We're going to break the change.
[00:35:43.772 --> 00:35:46.213]  They tell you caring and having passion is stupid.
[00:35:47.154 --> 00:35:51.336]  Being a scared little nerd, hiding out is the way to go.
[00:35:51.596 --> 00:35:55.478]  When I say a scared little nerd, I mean the big, tough guys acting like they got all the answers.
[00:35:56.238 --> 00:36:00.460]  When you start talking to them, that lake's a mile wide, a millimeter deep.
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.602]  What we're talking about has no depths.
[00:36:05.942 --> 00:36:06.563]  It's eternal.
[00:36:07.463 --> 00:36:08.183]  It's continual.
[00:36:08.624 --> 00:36:10.845]  It's a figure eight set on its side.
[00:36:12.405 --> 00:36:13.026]  Infinity.
[00:36:14.404 --> 00:36:17.165]  Stare into infinity.
[00:36:17.785 --> 00:36:19.105]  Glenn Beck says I'm scary.
[00:36:19.205 --> 00:36:19.945]  You bet I am.
[00:36:19.965 --> 00:36:22.746]  If I was him, I'd be scared.
[00:36:23.366 --> 00:36:24.226]  Scared of the truth.
[00:36:26.527 --> 00:36:27.667]  Scared of the standard.
[00:36:29.447 --> 00:36:30.828]  Being lifted up against the enemy.
[00:36:31.508 --> 00:36:32.928]  When the enemy comes in like a flood.
[00:36:34.828 --> 00:36:35.889]  Alright, there you go.
[00:36:35.909 --> 00:36:37.729]  A little bit of spoken word for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:41.490]  Good stuff.
[00:36:44.158 --> 00:36:45.339]  Just admit you love the song, folks.
[00:36:45.359 --> 00:36:45.979]  Don't be ashamed of it.
[00:36:46.959 --> 00:36:47.600]  Rap song.
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.060]  Threatens riots.
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:49.941]  Trump assassination.
[00:36:50.281 --> 00:36:51.061]  Media celebrates.
[00:36:52.162 --> 00:36:54.323]  Paul Watson wrote this article yesterday.
[00:36:55.404 --> 00:36:56.664]  And I mentioned it.
[00:36:56.724 --> 00:36:57.365]  I covered it somewhat.
[00:36:57.385 --> 00:36:57.965]  I didn't play it.
[00:36:58.005 --> 00:36:58.645]  We bleeped it.
[00:37:00.626 --> 00:37:04.128]  And the reason I'm covering it the day after we broke it, the day after it was on Drudge and went super viral.
[00:37:04.148 --> 00:37:05.929]  It was the fifth biggest story on Google News.
[00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:16.095]  I started to read the comments on World Hip Hop Star or whatever it's called.
[00:37:16.115 --> 00:37:21.560]  I followed some of the links and man, it was just very, very saddening.
[00:37:22.941 --> 00:37:25.664]  Because it's even kind of a well-natured video.
[00:37:25.724 --> 00:37:35.153]  It's like, I like white people and I like Mexicans and I'm, you know, a black guy and man, we're all together, but boy, I tell you that Trump's a racist and he's scary and he's coming to get us and somebody needs to kill him.
[00:37:36.638 --> 00:37:40.900]  And these folks really think they're fighting somebody evil because the media told them so.
[00:37:45.542 --> 00:37:45.942]  It's sad.
[00:37:47.263 --> 00:37:47.623]  It's sad.
[00:37:47.923 --> 00:37:52.706]  Donald Trump has said he thinks vaccines are dangerous because it hurt his family.
[00:37:53.786 --> 00:37:57.128]  And Donald Trump, by the way, nobody even knows that.
[00:37:57.168 --> 00:37:58.068]  I'm just gonna stop right there.
[00:37:58.889 --> 00:38:02.490]  Donald Trump knows China has a 35% tariff on us on average.
[00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:03.151]  Sometimes it's higher.
[00:38:03.471 --> 00:38:05.772]  So it's impossible to compete and they're shutting us down.
[00:38:06.886 --> 00:38:14.868]  So, this is somebody who the elite are scared of because they've got a dossier on him and they believe he really intends to deliver.
[00:38:15.688 --> 00:38:17.509]  Why wouldn't he want to deliver and save America?
[00:38:18.749 --> 00:38:19.650]  And be a superstar?
[00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:20.950]  And be the new George Washington?
[00:38:23.791 --> 00:38:25.491]  And yeah, it's because he is an egomaniac.
[00:38:25.971 --> 00:38:26.431]  A good one.
[00:38:27.532 --> 00:38:28.692]  That's a bad trait.
[00:38:29.452 --> 00:38:35.394]  If you're a good person who cares about other people and you've got delusions of grandeur and they happen, they're not delusions of grandeur.
[00:38:39.502 --> 00:38:44.044]  One time, a couple times I've been called by like Psychology Today and the big psychology publications.
[00:38:44.485 --> 00:38:54.630]  One time it was a Clinton operative to the interview, it was a psychologist and he's asked me during the interview, he goes, so you think people watch you in public and talk about you in public?
[00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.971]  And I said, yeah, I'm a public figure, some people do.
[00:38:56.991 --> 00:39:03.474]  And he goes, so then in the magazine I'm narcissistic and crazy and think people are talking about me because I'm imagining.
[00:39:03.494 --> 00:39:05.015]  And I was talking to another
[00:39:06.479 --> 00:39:07.803]  Psychologist that was doing a piece.
[00:39:07.863 --> 00:39:09.067]  I want to talk to him just for fun.
[00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:11.835]  And I was telling him how many listeners we had.
[00:39:13.643 --> 00:39:15.505]  And they were laughing, oh and oh, sure.
[00:39:15.905 --> 00:39:19.428]  And then in the article it said that I basically was exaggerating our audience.
[00:39:20.088 --> 00:39:23.591]  Actually, our audience is bigger than I say, but the numbers I give you are what we can prove.
[00:39:24.492 --> 00:39:37.963]  It's not about Alex Jones, but Alex Jones and this radio show is a microcosm of the success of the Liberty Movement, and Gallup polls and other polls out showing the mainstream media has a 6% approval rating.
[00:39:39.424 --> 00:39:39.584]  Well, 6%.
[00:39:39.624 --> 00:39:39.864]  Trust it.
[00:39:43.427 --> 00:39:47.288]  Trust, it's Congress has a 9% approval rating for a couple years now.
[00:39:48.468 --> 00:39:51.869]  And they sit there in their arrogant con artist mode.
[00:39:51.889 --> 00:39:56.010]  I mean, I rarely do interviews anymore, but when I do, I'm going to start taping them.
[00:39:56.030 --> 00:40:04.072]  I'm going to say, yeah, I'll do an interview with you at the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times or Vanity Fair or wherever, but I'll do it over the phone and I'll do it.
[00:40:04.112 --> 00:40:05.492]  I'm going to tape it and put the whole interview out.
[00:40:06.229 --> 00:40:08.330]  Because I'll sit there and they'll go, so you believe there's a world government?
[00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:10.310]  And I'll go, yeah, let me give you a few quotes of world leaders.
[00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:13.071]  And they go, oh, that's another world government they're talking about.
[00:40:13.291 --> 00:40:14.871]  And they play these mind games.
[00:40:14.891 --> 00:40:21.753]  In fact, let me play the Sean Hannity piece first, because this is Sean Hannity just going, look, man, I'm not playing along with this.
[00:40:21.893 --> 00:40:23.533]  Stop it, Senator Cruz.
[00:40:24.073 --> 00:40:27.394]  You've been on this show more than anybody, he tells them, because he's been a supporter of them before.
[00:40:28.714 --> 00:40:32.415]  But you see Cruz destroying himself with Clinton-level whoppers.
[00:40:32.435 --> 00:40:34.976]  I mean, lies that would make Pinocchio blush.
[00:40:36.817 --> 00:40:42.361]  That would make Pinocchio's nose blush and Geppetto run in fear.
[00:40:44.663 --> 00:40:47.845]  I mean, he is stabbing himself on his own Pinocchio nose.
[00:40:47.885 --> 00:40:49.506]  He is falling on his own lies.
[00:40:50.006 --> 00:40:53.909]  He's going, we've had a huge landslide, the democracy has spoken, the voters have spoken.
[00:40:53.949 --> 00:40:55.270]  These are the terms he uses.
[00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:59.973]  Landslide, grassroots rebellion, uprising.
[00:41:03.296 --> 00:41:04.697]  Complaining Donald.
[00:41:05.297 --> 00:41:06.318]  Loser Donald.
[00:41:07.864 --> 00:41:10.045]  They've never cancelled these things before.
[00:41:10.965 --> 00:41:15.586]  I guess in Nevada once they did, four years ago, and it was a huge deduce, they didn't do it this year.
[00:41:16.547 --> 00:41:16.927]  As bad.
[00:41:17.747 --> 00:41:23.629]  But I mean, this is the biggest theft we've ever seen where they look at us, I was getting a cup of coffee.
[00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:26.490]  Quote John Goodman, I'm finishing my coffee.
[00:41:28.154 --> 00:41:29.654]  Oh yeah, I'm sitting right here finishing my coffee.
[00:41:30.395 --> 00:41:32.695]  And I'm back, you haven't seen the Big Lebowski, you don't get it folks.
[00:41:33.196 --> 00:41:37.577]  I'm back there in the coffee room and we got TVs on every room to monitor enemy transmissions, literally.
[00:41:38.317 --> 00:41:40.138]  When I say enemy transmissions, I mean enemy transmissions.
[00:41:40.878 --> 00:41:50.441]  And we're sitting there watching it and it's Paul Ryan with those little schoolgirl eyes of his that you know the Republican leadership just loves, you know, at those parties.
[00:41:51.221 --> 00:41:55.323]  And you can just see him looking up at you with those little eyes.
[00:41:55.343 --> 00:41:56.403]  And pretty boy Paul Ryan
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:03.522]  And he's sitting there going, we're going to follow the rules and that's what we're going to do with the delegates.
[00:42:03.783 --> 00:42:06.164]  And you know, the delegates can vote who they want.
[00:42:06.184 --> 00:42:07.084]  So we're going to follow the rules.
[00:42:07.164 --> 00:42:07.744]  Okay.
[00:42:08.985 --> 00:42:10.025]  I mean, it's so creepy.
[00:42:11.726 --> 00:42:13.887]  Folks understand we have election laws.
[00:42:13.927 --> 00:42:15.267]  You act like one person, one vote.
[00:42:15.507 --> 00:42:16.928]  It's a felony to vote illegally.
[00:42:17.748 --> 00:42:19.049]  There's all this public money spent.
[00:42:20.447 --> 00:42:26.675]  We have popular vote, and if you say we don't, well then we need to change what you're doing, because that makes you a dictatorship.
[00:42:26.855 --> 00:42:34.204]  Even if what you're saying's true, you can just declare yourselves this new oligarchy in the parties, like the Central Committee.
[00:42:36.724 --> 00:42:44.727]  Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity and others just a few months ago would kind of go in and out of attacking Trump or supporting him because they know where the populist movement is, whether you love Trump or hate him.
[00:42:44.747 --> 00:42:46.328]  They don't want to be against their audience.
[00:42:46.628 --> 00:42:51.890]  Now they're forced to come out against the Republican establishment because their listeners are driving them to do it.
[00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:53.150]  And that's a beautiful thing.
[00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:54.271]  They're not buying it.
[00:42:54.511 --> 00:42:56.592]  And that's why Hannity's like, stop, stop.
[00:42:57.032 --> 00:43:01.353]  Stop saying you had a landslide in states where there was no election.
[00:43:01.674 --> 00:43:02.314]  Stop it!
[00:43:05.094 --> 00:43:07.875]  And that's how I feel when somebody sits there and con games me.
[00:43:08.876 --> 00:43:09.956]  I've got pretty good children.
[00:43:13.038 --> 00:43:18.760]  But my son has a tendency to put tangerine and orange peels, he's done it since he was two years old, under the couch cushions.
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:31.366]  And the other day, we're in there, we're reading, we're in the living room, classical music's on, this is what's going on in my house on a Saturday, and I watch him stuff tangerine peels underneath the seat.
[00:43:32.278 --> 00:43:38.981]  Just unconsciously, about an hour later, I said, son, Rex, go over there and get the peels out.
[00:43:39.001 --> 00:43:40.721]  And he goes, there are no peels.
[00:43:40.801 --> 00:43:42.122]  I looked up and said, you see those?
[00:43:42.562 --> 00:43:43.582]  He goes, I didn't do that.
[00:43:44.143 --> 00:43:49.185]  And I said, you're grounded for a week, brother, and you're out of tennis practice and everything else.
[00:43:51.185 --> 00:43:52.866]  And he looked at me, and he's so honest.
[00:43:52.886 --> 00:43:53.526]  He's so good.
[00:43:55.007 --> 00:43:57.268]  But when they're young, they get to that age, they want to test stuff out.
[00:43:58.530 --> 00:43:59.511]  He goes, well, I don't really remember doing it.
[00:43:59.551 --> 00:44:02.593]  And I said, you subconsciously stuffed him under there right in front of me an hour ago.
[00:44:03.393 --> 00:44:04.734]  And it's just little stuff like that.
[00:44:05.614 --> 00:44:10.337]  And I didn't really get mad at him, but he's not a 50-something-year-old U.S.
[00:44:10.377 --> 00:44:10.698]  Senator.
[00:44:11.358 --> 00:44:15.240]  I watched stuff the orange peels under the seat, under the red sofa.
[00:44:16.261 --> 00:44:16.801]  I watched it.
[00:44:17.842 --> 00:44:19.703]  Don't tell me, Cruz, I didn't see it.
[00:44:20.544 --> 00:44:22.305]  Stop treating me like a moron!
[00:44:23.766 --> 00:44:27.729]  He's got top psych warfare British firms writing his scripts now.
[00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:33.653]  Oh, you're paying millions so they come up with total bald-faced con lies to keep stating?
[00:44:34.714 --> 00:44:36.155]  The democracy isn't spoken?
[00:44:36.375 --> 00:44:37.336]  Landslides?
[00:44:37.936 --> 00:44:42.340]  I get all the delegates, I'm winning, the people have spoken, this is an uprising?
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:48.404]  You know, I could have told you those lies for nothing!
[00:44:51.676 --> 00:45:01.400]  I mean, notice how the con man goes to the bigger con man, like the Emperor's New Clothes, and pays them for the imaginary gold-sewn outfit he's gonna wear, and there's nothing there.
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:06.542]  And Ted Cruz has put on this outfit and walked out naked in front of everyone and went, I'm winning!
[00:45:06.562 --> 00:45:08.283]  The grassroots, I'm the king!
[00:45:08.303 --> 00:45:10.084]  Everybody's going, he's butt-naked.
[00:45:10.444 --> 00:45:12.405]  But the media goes, no he's not, it's beautiful, it's beautiful.
[00:45:12.665 --> 00:45:14.746]  And finally people just go, you know what, he is naked.
[00:45:15.526 --> 00:45:17.707]  Man, put it away, put some underwear on, Cruz.
[00:45:17.907 --> 00:45:18.968]  He's like, it's golden!
[00:45:20.063 --> 00:45:21.624]  You know this parable, the emperor's new clothes?
[00:45:21.684 --> 00:45:22.464]  I'm sure you do, folks.
[00:45:23.144 --> 00:45:24.025]  If not, just Google it.
[00:45:25.885 --> 00:45:26.906]  So let's go to Hannity.
[00:45:26.926 --> 00:45:30.827]  I'm not going to play the whole thing because it's long, but he just starts flipping out on him, as he should.
[00:45:30.847 --> 00:45:33.028]  This is the normal behavior.
[00:45:35.529 --> 00:45:36.570]  When you're being lied to, hear this.
[00:45:37.461 --> 00:45:39.082]  It's more than a process question.
[00:45:39.443 --> 00:45:45.967]  It's an integrity of the election question, and everybody's asking me this question, so I'm giving you an opportunity to explain it.
[00:45:46.388 --> 00:45:50.571]  Sean, the only people asking this question are the hardcore Donald Trump supporters.
[00:45:50.831 --> 00:45:53.693]  Why do you do this every single time?
[00:45:54.073 --> 00:45:55.034]  No, you've got to stop.
[00:45:55.274 --> 00:45:59.937]  Every time I have you on the air and I ask a legitimate question, you're trying to throw this in my face.
[00:45:59.977 --> 00:46:00.738]  I'm getting sick of it.
[00:46:01.078 --> 00:46:04.481]  I've had you on more than any other candidate on radio and TV.
[00:46:05.276 --> 00:46:09.277]  So if I ask you, Senator, a legitimate question to explain to the audience, why don't you just answer it?
[00:46:09.977 --> 00:46:11.838]  Sean, can I answer your question without being interrupted?
[00:46:11.858 --> 00:46:12.338]  Go ahead.
[00:46:12.398 --> 00:46:16.399]  In the last three weeks, there have been five elections in five states.
[00:46:16.759 --> 00:46:21.501]  Utah, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Colorado, Wyoming.
[00:46:21.901 --> 00:46:22.941]  We've won all five.
[00:46:23.241 --> 00:46:27.222]  Over 1.3 million people voted in those five states.
[00:46:27.642 --> 00:46:27.882]  What?
[00:46:28.122 --> 00:46:29.303]  We won all five.
[00:46:29.423 --> 00:46:29.583]  What?
[00:46:29.643 --> 00:46:33.264]  All of this noise and complaining and whining has come from the Trump campaign.
[00:46:33.684 --> 00:46:33.844]  Wow.
[00:46:33.884 --> 00:46:34.925]  He does it again.
[00:46:51.451 --> 00:46:53.612]  We won landslides in all five.
[00:46:53.732 --> 00:46:59.136]  Now there is a second component beyond the elections, which is the individual delegates are elected by the people.
[00:46:59.296 --> 00:47:03.178]  Donald Trump's campaign does not know how to organize on the grassroots.
[00:47:03.278 --> 00:47:14.745]  And so when the delegates are elected, conservative activists, real conservative activists, and they elect delegates, and we are winning those elections over and over and over again, the Donald Trump campaign doesn't know what they're doing.
[00:47:14.785 --> 00:47:15.585]  They don't show up.
[00:47:15.725 --> 00:47:16.546]  In Colorado,
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:23.044]  Okay, so they go and they claim, oh, you were all delegates from years ago.
[00:47:23.324 --> 00:47:24.044]  That's how it works.
[00:47:24.545 --> 00:47:33.030]  You show up, and there's just no election, and then they organize who they think has pledged to Cruz, and they claim he wins all 34 delegates.
[00:47:34.211 --> 00:47:35.652]  And he calls that a voter.
[00:47:35.712 --> 00:47:44.438]  This is the new, weird, again, alchemy, twisting, turned lead into gold baloney that they're engaged in.
[00:47:45.785 --> 00:47:55.033]  And then he goes into states where he wins the popular vote in Arizona and all these other places, Louisiana, Tennessee, and then takes them, Georgia.
[00:47:56.634 --> 00:48:02.179]  And then it turns out in many cases, the party's just claiming these superdelegates are representatives.
[00:48:02.199 --> 00:48:03.220]  They're just making it up.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.861]  Lawsuits are being filed.
[00:48:06.782 --> 00:48:11.867]  And then, just like a lawyer would do, a fancy Goldman Sachs lawyer would do,
[00:48:14.605 --> 00:48:16.187]  I mean, I love New Yorkers.
[00:48:16.227 --> 00:48:16.947]  I love Northerners.
[00:48:17.208 --> 00:48:18.649]  I love real Americana Yankees.
[00:48:18.669 --> 00:48:24.635]  I don't like a bunch of foreigners move in and then say they don't like Donald Trump because he's not an American and then the person that wasn't even born here.
[00:48:24.655 --> 00:48:27.958]  Nothing against people that weren't born here, but folks bashing Donald Trump.
[00:48:28.499 --> 00:48:30.761]  But I'll tell you, you got somebody from Canada
[00:48:33.936 --> 00:48:39.057]  Talking about Donald Trump and New York values and bashing Donald Trump?
[00:48:39.497 --> 00:48:50.219]  The folks with New York values that he was talking about, slicksters, con artists like Goldman Sachs people like himself, they're the ones that voted for you, Cruz.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.420]  That's where he got votes, was in Manhattan.
[00:48:56.201 --> 00:48:57.461]  The people, the farmers,
[00:48:59.813 --> 00:49:05.618]  The shop owners, the factory owners in the smaller towns in rural New York, they went basically 100% for Trump.
[00:49:06.379 --> 00:49:08.801]  Those are New York values and those are Texas values.
[00:49:10.503 --> 00:49:16.088]  It makes me sick to see somebody from Canada play the region card on the American people.
[00:49:17.193 --> 00:49:19.034]  Who are battling for this country's future.
[00:49:19.054 --> 00:49:20.436]  This country is at a death battle.
[00:49:20.976 --> 00:49:27.761]  And Americans have to come together now against the globalists, and the communist Chinese, and the Saudi Arabians, and everybody else lecturing us.
[00:49:28.522 --> 00:49:37.689]  And I don't want to hear any more of that Hillary Clinton bashing Southerners with her crud, or fake Southerners bashing Northerners.
[00:49:37.809 --> 00:49:39.431]  It's a load of bull.
[00:49:39.711 --> 00:49:43.454]  It's more balkanization, more race baiting, more garbage.
[00:49:46.547 --> 00:49:51.890]  Now, by the way, I've gotten to where when we have a special, I end it on the day we're going to end it, generally.
[00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:56.592]  And it's normal because we can only have a special so long because if something gets ready to sell out, we've got to hold something back.

[00:50:23.903 --> 00:50:27.727]  Maybe just a few more hours, because I need to hold some back and not just sell out of it before it gets here in a month.
[00:50:28.127 --> 00:50:29.488]  Brain Force, our top nootropic.
[00:50:29.749 --> 00:50:32.411]  We've got enough to keep going a few more hours at the sale.
[00:50:32.431 --> 00:50:33.212]  I'm going to hold some back.
[00:50:33.232 --> 00:50:34.053]  We'll go to regular price.

[00:50:50.427 --> 00:50:52.028]  And it's got vitamin B12 and a bunch of other things.
[00:50:52.068 --> 00:50:55.611]  Barcopa Herb Extract.
[00:50:56.772 --> 00:50:58.453]  It's got a bunch of other stuff I can't pronounce.
[00:50:58.613 --> 00:51:01.636]  But the top physicists, scientists, and chemists and folks have come up with this.
[00:51:01.676 --> 00:51:03.818]  And it's very popular on the third-party review sites.
[00:51:04.118 --> 00:51:04.858]  Five-star reviews.
[00:51:04.978 --> 00:51:05.459]  Infowars.
[00:51:05.759 --> 00:51:06.460]  Life.com.
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:07.621]  It is ending in a few hours.
[00:51:08.261 --> 00:51:09.142]  BrainForce available.
[00:51:11.204 --> 00:51:12.225]  Brain Force is here.
[00:51:12.745 --> 00:51:15.047]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:51:15.307 --> 00:51:23.112]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:51:23.891 --> 00:51:27.474]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:51:27.494 --> 00:51:29.835]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:51:30.195 --> 00:51:33.718]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:51:33.758 --> 00:51:36.900]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:51:37.401 --> 00:51:42.204]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:51:42.744 --> 00:51:44.566]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:51:44.926 --> 00:51:49.349]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:51:49.509 --> 00:51:51.510]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:51:52.131 --> 00:51:53.592]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:51:53.752 --> 00:51:53.992]  Exactly.
[00:51:54.012 --> 00:51:57.833]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:51:58.313 --> 00:52:06.296]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:52:11.098 --> 00:52:14.059]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[00:52:14.339 --> 00:52:23.921]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[00:52:24.221 --> 00:52:29.422]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[00:52:29.502 --> 00:52:38.364]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[00:52:38.624 --> 00:52:47.206]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[00:52:47.466 --> 00:52:54.368]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spigerex herbal processing technique.
[00:52:54.508 --> 00:52:59.809]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you the best.

[00:53:05.754 --> 00:53:08.837]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:53:08.937 --> 00:53:14.001]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:53:14.182 --> 00:53:16.444]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:53:16.624 --> 00:53:24.871]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:53:25.251 --> 00:53:28.574]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:53:28.734 --> 00:53:39.223]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:53:39.403 --> 00:53:46.669]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:53:46.869 --> 00:53:48.751]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:53:49.091 --> 00:53:56.759]  Supermail Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:03.226]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:54:03.526 --> 00:54:10.454]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Supermail Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:54:40.013 --> 00:54:45.398]  Just slid back into the chair here a little bit late, almost a little bit late, because I was busy sending a tweet out.
[00:54:50.163 --> 00:54:57.209]  And I don't normally tweet at Drudge or tweet at Trump, but I really think there's been a missed opportunity here, partially.
[00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:01.373]  Drudge hasn't missed it, he linked to it yesterday and linked to it a few weeks ago in the first broker last week.
[00:55:01.994 --> 00:55:02.814]  Phyllis Lafley is
[00:55:04.642 --> 00:55:12.806]  A true intellectual woman, super smart, founded the modern conservative movement that tried to stop the globalist takeover, the whole Barry Goldwater deal.
[00:55:13.206 --> 00:55:14.246]  She's 91 years old.
[00:55:14.787 --> 00:55:18.188]  My grandmother's about to be 91, and she's sharper than my grandmother, who's still completely there.
[00:55:19.049 --> 00:55:26.672]  And there was a coup by Cruz operatives to take over her very powerful organization, Eagle Forum, because she supported Trump.
[00:55:26.932 --> 00:55:32.675]  They said that she was mentally ill, basically, and crazy, really, along with the majority of other Americans.
[00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:42.793]  Maybe the Republicans have a rule that Ted Cruz is allowed to take over the millions of the bank accounts and all the chapters and organizations of women and others in equal form around the country?
[00:55:43.433 --> 00:55:43.813]  Maybe so.
[00:55:44.634 --> 00:55:47.695]  Maybe that's the case.
[00:55:47.735 --> 00:55:55.158]  But I think, you know, routinely, Donald Trump tweets InfoWars.com videos and articles.
[00:55:59.568 --> 00:56:12.573]  I don't know, a lot of my thoughts get telegraphed over to Trump, and he resonates a lot, but I really think he should make an issue about Phyllis Schlafly, not just with conservatives, but everybody, about how Cruz tried to take over this lady's organization.
[00:56:15.011 --> 00:56:16.272]  So she's on with us in one hour.
[00:56:16.772 --> 00:56:17.873]  I should have added that earlier.
[00:56:18.354 --> 00:56:19.695]  She'll be joining us in the third hour.
[00:56:20.535 --> 00:56:23.557]  We have another informative guest joining us in the next segment.
[00:56:23.818 --> 00:56:26.099]  Stan Day, really an expert, predicted all of this.
[00:56:26.119 --> 00:56:35.727]  I don't have the staff to even go back when he was on last year and predicted that this year would be incredible earthquakes and more, but now you see that he's going to be joining us to talk about earth changes and more in the second hour.
[00:56:36.987 --> 00:56:39.589]  And then in the third hour, we've got David Knight always does a great job.
[00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:42.452]  He'll be honchoing and quarterbacking the operation.
[00:56:43.612 --> 00:56:47.874]  But Phyllis Schlafly is going to be on and I just tweeted it out.
[00:56:47.894 --> 00:56:53.617]  You can go to RealAlexJones and retweet that everybody with the link to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:56:54.938 --> 00:57:00.681]  So that everybody at the Eagle Forum that survived the coup, and everybody else can hopefully retweet this.
[00:57:00.741 --> 00:57:05.663]  And again, this tweet won't save the world, but I'm just getting better at actually trying to promote the show, which is growing.
[00:57:05.703 --> 00:57:10.986]  But if we just do a few other things, kind of like untying the boat from the dock when the motor's going, we'll go a little bit faster.
[00:57:11.866 --> 00:57:14.548]  And you, the listeners, really are the engine of this whole operation.
[00:57:14.588 --> 00:57:16.769]  So, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:57:17.309 --> 00:57:18.430]  Send that link out to everybody.
[00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:20.371]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:57:20.671 --> 00:57:22.252]  Put in your email if you want key alerts.
[00:57:23.895 --> 00:57:30.041]  I want to get into this whole rap video saying basically kill Donald Trump and the people on it
[00:57:42.867 --> 00:57:45.448]  Really look like they're proud of themselves and think they're doing well.
[00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:48.370]  There's a, there's a, there's a jolliness to it.
[00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:51.171]  Like, you know, Santa Claus talking about this stuff.
[00:57:51.772 --> 00:57:55.634]  Because it's like, hey, the mainstream media says it's okay to do and everybody jumps in on it.
[00:57:56.634 --> 00:58:04.078]  It reminds me of that, uh, you know, lighthearted video where folks are like, when looking for the leprechaun, they're like, everybody see the leprechaun?
[00:58:04.098 --> 00:58:05.119]  Say, yeah, yeah.
[00:58:05.139 --> 00:58:05.979]  It's like, it's fun.
[00:58:06.639 --> 00:58:08.040]  So there's this jolliness to it.
[00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:09.321]  That's what's so scary about it.
[00:58:10.367 --> 00:58:23.658]  Is that it's just, whether it's, you know, UT students or whether it's women or whether it's whoever it is, uh, you know, at a feminist meeting, they just really think it's the right thing to talk about killing people because you disagree with them.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.922]  And the media and the Secret Service and everybody else just lets them do it.
[00:58:27.942 --> 00:58:30.004]  In fact, there's an article out today, Secret Service is overwhelmed.
[00:58:30.024 --> 00:58:31.125]  They can't even deal with all this.
[00:58:32.486 --> 00:58:34.247]  So, Donald Trump's pretty mild.
[00:58:34.287 --> 00:58:35.268]  He's just a nationalist.
[00:58:35.748 --> 00:58:37.590]  And he's got them so scared, folks.
[00:58:38.070 --> 00:58:38.551]  It's crazy.
[00:58:39.485 --> 00:58:40.906]  We'll be back with the second hour.
[00:58:40.926 --> 00:58:43.387]  If you're listening to us on AM and FM stations, oh, that's so important.
[00:58:43.707 --> 00:58:52.913]  Tell everybody, everybody at your work, you name it, lunch is coming up right now, to tune in to their lunch hour to this local affiliate you're listening to, or send out that link to infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:58:53.693 --> 00:58:54.674]  That's how we win the war.
[00:58:55.534 --> 00:58:58.736]  People power, grassroots, nothing can stop you.
[00:59:00.934 --> 00:59:01.934]  BrainForce is here.
[00:59:02.475 --> 00:59:04.756]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:59:05.016 --> 00:59:12.839]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:59:13.618 --> 00:59:17.201]  One of the worst things with most energy products, this is not sustainable, right?
[00:59:17.221 --> 00:59:19.562]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:59:19.922 --> 00:59:23.445]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:59:23.485 --> 00:59:26.627]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:59:27.128 --> 00:59:31.931]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:59:32.451 --> 00:59:34.293]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:59:34.633 --> 00:59:39.056]  That is activated by the different compounds in the yerba mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:59:39.236 --> 00:59:41.237]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:59:41.858 --> 00:59:43.319]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:59:43.479 --> 00:59:47.562]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:59:48.042 --> 00:59:56.227]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:59:56.267 --> 00:59:59.129]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:16.882]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:17.262 --> 01:00:19.583]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:00:22.524 --> 01:00:25.565]  Phyllis Schlafly mugged by the cruise operatives.
[01:00:25.945 --> 01:00:27.526]  Unsuccessfully, they kind of hit her on the head.
[01:00:27.646 --> 01:00:28.746]  Got the purse away for a minute.
[01:00:28.986 --> 01:00:30.727]  Bystanders tackled him, got the purse back.
[01:00:30.747 --> 01:00:33.528]  I mean, that's by allegory of them trying to take over the Eagle for him.
[01:00:35.526 --> 01:00:38.210]  She's gonna be joining us, popping in in the third hour today.
[01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:41.774]  We have Stan Dale and huge Earth changes coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:41.794 --> 01:00:46.340]  I mean, I really cannot stress to you enough that you know I don't really cover Earth changes, though I follow them.
[01:00:46.721 --> 01:00:49.765]  I never get into the Planet X, or I never get into all this stuff, but man...
[01:00:50.906 --> 01:01:02.657]  Now, all crazy, it's like, National Geographic, there is a giant Kuiper belt gas giant the size of Jupiter, you know, coming in and earthquakes and record levels and just, it's crazy.
[01:01:02.917 --> 01:01:03.738]  I don't know what's going on.
[01:01:04.058 --> 01:01:06.400]  But I know Stan Day up predicted on the show last year.
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:07.941]  Can we look up the date when he was here?
[01:01:07.961 --> 01:01:10.844]  Because I mean, I guess I never even asked you guys to do this.
[01:01:10.884 --> 01:01:14.667]  We could go find where he said next year is going to be just the most, you know, tectonic ever.
[01:01:14.727 --> 01:01:17.390]  And back then, California was
[01:01:18.854 --> 01:01:19.294]  That's right.
[01:01:36.581 --> 01:01:54.065]  But it's back in the news today, and I really want to do a piece where I look at Mono, I mean Bono, and when I look at George Clooney and all these guys, because I've talked to a lot of big insiders in Hollywood, and I've actually been at parties before where some of these people have been there, and I mean exclusive parties where there's like 60 people, 20 people.
[01:01:55.885 --> 01:02:04.967]  And they are the most insulated, fake, intellectual, know-it-alls, pampered, but on a very short leash from the producers.
[01:02:07.509 --> 01:02:14.152]  And I don't want to bash people like Matt Damon and George Clooney and Alec Baldwin.
[01:02:14.613 --> 01:02:19.135]  It's been very useful to me to quote Kim Jong-il in Team America.
[01:02:20.035 --> 01:02:23.737]  But what shocked me the last few years was talking to people and they go, no, no, no.
[01:02:24.217 --> 01:02:25.738]  With Clooney, it's all an act.
[01:02:26.518 --> 01:02:28.139]  And with Matt Damon, it's all an act.
[01:02:28.299 --> 01:02:30.440]  And with Ben Affleck, it's all an act.
[01:02:31.301 --> 01:02:34.082]  And that behind the scenes, there's other big stars that told me this.
[01:02:34.442 --> 01:02:36.063]  They literally know about everything.
[01:02:37.199 --> 01:02:37.639]  I don't know.
[01:02:59.571 --> 01:03:11.234]  But instead, these guys know about everything and have decided, Leonardo DiCaprio, you name it, to wallow with the establishment when they know it's all a giant fraud just for their careers.
[01:03:11.474 --> 01:03:18.636]  People go, well yeah, that's how you climb ladders, that's how you brown nose, and I guess that's the separation right there.
[01:03:19.857 --> 01:03:27.979]  I'd rather go out and create my own media system and make films that are seen hundreds of millions of times and really interface with humanity and have a future for my progeny
[01:03:29.175 --> 01:03:33.303]  Then just fly around in helicopters and have these weird, neurotic, anorexic lives.
[01:03:33.703 --> 01:03:34.906]  I've been out in LA a lot, folks.
[01:03:35.928 --> 01:03:37.070]  They are so depressed.
[01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:38.052]  It's horrible.
[01:03:38.893 --> 01:03:39.354]  It's horrible.
[01:03:41.971 --> 01:03:44.814]  But again, they're just actors who play the part for the producers.
[01:03:44.934 --> 01:03:52.440]  And so you have people like Chris Carter, who's a listener, and says he likes my work, and the world government's a threat, and I haven't gone out to meet him yet, and he says he wants to, and I want to too.
[01:03:52.901 --> 01:03:59.407]  But see, I'm kind of at that level where, and I'm not bragging, I'm just saying, being a liberty lover, see, is I'm not down there as an actor like one of these people.
[01:04:00.592 --> 01:04:05.874]  Who just gets up there and I guess acts again like they, you know, want a carbon tax to save the Earth and the polar bears.
[01:04:05.894 --> 01:04:07.115]  I really care about humanity.
[01:04:07.475 --> 01:04:12.677]  And so the good news is I'm interfacing with the producers and the people that these folks like George Clooney work for.
[01:04:14.357 --> 01:04:22.240]  That's why George Clooney wants to be a director and a producer and has other people basically make his films and then, you know, he can be like the big wig and pretend he has a brain.
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:24.061]  But the truth is he does have a brain.
[01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:25.201]  That's what's scary.
[01:04:27.022 --> 01:04:28.843]  These guys all know about this stuff.
[01:04:30.310 --> 01:04:38.995]  Brad Pitt has seen my films, he has seen the late great Aaron Russo's film, and what does he do?
[01:04:39.035 --> 01:04:44.478]  He goes and grovels to the UN, and his wife goes and joins it, and the CFR.
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:52.802]  I mean like 10 years ago, or 11, 12 years ago, oh Brad Pitt's waking up, oh really cool, oh yeah.
[01:04:54.663 --> 01:04:59.046]  Have these interactions, I'm not gonna even get into it, it doesn't even matter, it's so stupid.
[01:05:00.182 --> 01:05:03.384]  I mean, I'm not into Billy Corgan because he's a big rock star or whatever.
[01:05:03.484 --> 01:05:08.307]  I'm into it because he's informed and knows what's going on and has the courage to speak out when they try to penalize him.
[01:05:08.367 --> 01:05:09.688]  It's not about worshipping celebrity.
[01:05:10.548 --> 01:05:19.553]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:05:19.633 --> 01:05:27.738]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:05:28.038 --> 01:05:32.720]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:05:32.901 --> 01:05:39.624]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.

[01:06:10.515 --> 01:06:12.056]  My name is Alex Jones.
[01:06:12.436 --> 01:06:18.357]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:06:18.577 --> 01:06:19.738]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[01:06:21.138 --> 01:06:35.289]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalists.
[01:06:35.669 --> 01:06:39.772]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[01:06:43.695 --> 01:06:50.841]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[01:06:51.101 --> 01:06:56.846]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.

[01:08:21.039 --> 01:08:25.200]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:27.400]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:31.561]  Phyllis Schlafly.
[01:08:31.801 --> 01:08:32.261]  Who?
[01:08:50.413 --> 01:08:54.275]  Cruz operatives reportedly tried to take over her operation a few weeks ago.
[01:08:54.295 --> 01:09:00.517]  Has only done one video since this happened, breaking down what happened that I know of.
[01:09:00.537 --> 01:09:08.300]  She's going to be joining us, much exclusively, first here today, popping in in the third hour.
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:17.964]  This is a big deal because, you know, Ted Cruz and the Republican Party say that, you know, popular voting never existed in primaries and that we've all made it up and that we're all insane.
[01:09:19.226 --> 01:09:23.768]  Well, maybe the Eagle Forum was never controlled by her and it just belonged to Ted Cruz forever.
[01:09:23.808 --> 01:09:26.129]  Maybe he founded it 55 years ago.
[01:09:28.650 --> 01:09:32.852]  I mean, the TPP tells us that it's secret and runs our country now and that we're not allowed to see it.
[01:09:32.932 --> 01:09:38.054]  So, you know, the sky's the limit when you get to this level of con artist behavior.
[01:09:39.415 --> 01:09:46.758]  We're also going to be getting into more of what's happening in Hollywood
[01:09:48.636 --> 01:10:00.222]  And people like Bono, who for decades puts out the first iPod for people with HIV, and then it turns out less than 1% of the money went to people.
[01:10:00.963 --> 01:10:06.226]  And then he does it for the UN and continues and sends less than 1% to actually help anybody.
[01:10:07.326 --> 01:10:09.367]  I mean, the best charities give like 85 to 90%.
[01:10:09.707 --> 01:10:10.668]  I get you have overhead.
[01:10:10.688 --> 01:10:14.310]  There's nothing wrong with that, with advertising and getting more money.
[01:10:16.497 --> 01:10:26.801]  I want to really start focusing in, because here's George Clooney raising $15 million for Hillary and the DNC in just a few days, but then denounces money in politics a day later.
[01:10:30.623 --> 01:10:35.765]  And I know people that know Clooney and these other folks, and I've seen it for myself with some of these Hollywood stars.
[01:10:36.345 --> 01:10:36.965]  They're actors.
[01:10:37.065 --> 01:10:44.188]  When they get up on TV and call for carbon taxes and gun control, a bunch of them are actually libertarian patriots like Kurt Russell.
[01:10:44.528 --> 01:10:45.729]  They know what's going on.
[01:10:48.404 --> 01:10:49.465]  But they won't go public.
[01:10:49.545 --> 01:10:55.309]  It's like Jeff Bridges contacting me just to say, hey, you know, I like what you're doing, appreciate your courage, whatever, but doesn't go public.
[01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:57.711]  Or somebody like Kurt Russell comes out.
[01:10:57.731 --> 01:10:59.012]  Well, I'm not liberal or conservative.
[01:10:59.212 --> 01:10:59.753]  I'm 1776.
[01:11:00.393 --> 01:11:01.994]  I don't like global government and the New World Order.
[01:11:04.777 --> 01:11:08.820]  Or Bruce Willis used to be a Republican until he saw my films.
[01:11:09.591 --> 01:11:14.095]  He told Rick Linklater, and I later had a chance to talk to him briefly, but yeah, I'm not going to go public.
[01:11:14.376 --> 01:11:15.256]  The public's too dumb.
[01:11:16.177 --> 01:11:19.120]  None of this is going anywhere, but yeah, you're dead on with what you're saying.
[01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:23.484]  He told Vanity Fair, he said there's a world government, same folks that killed Kennedy are still running things today.
[01:11:23.504 --> 01:11:26.066]  I used to be a Republican, but now I realize both parties are controlled.
[01:11:26.827 --> 01:11:33.991]  Again, if they ever lose Hollywood, they lose everybody because 80-90% of the propaganda is in movies and in fiction now.
[01:11:34.652 --> 01:11:35.572]  It's not even in news.
[01:11:35.712 --> 01:11:40.415]  We're winning the info war in the 10-15% of people that get their information from the news.
[01:11:41.035 --> 01:11:49.120]  Because they've been forced to just lie and lie and lie until the mainstream media and major Gallup polls and others has a 6-10% trust rate.
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:49.800]  The latest is 6%.
[01:11:50.181 --> 01:11:51.121]  We covered that.
[01:11:53.623 --> 01:11:55.544]  And there's other paradigms of the mainstream media.
[01:11:56.483 --> 01:12:07.269]  Our Earth, however it was created, however old it is, I don't go with a lot of the mainline Christian interpretations that are men's interpretations of the Bible, that the Earth is 6,000 years old.
[01:12:07.670 --> 01:12:18.996]  I don't go with mainline science that it's 4 or 5 billion years old and, you know, we only get hit by asteroids every 2 million years, because now they admit, because of Shoemaker-Levy research and what happened with that comet, that no, it's happening every 100,000 or so.
[01:12:21.141 --> 01:12:27.142]  And satellites show us giant craters all over the world that have just been filled in with water or filled in with trees.
[01:12:28.023 --> 01:12:29.123]  Filled in with foliage.
[01:12:31.123 --> 01:12:32.744]  I don't know all the mysteries of the universe.
[01:12:35.104 --> 01:12:35.965]  But I know this.
[01:12:36.665 --> 01:12:49.428]  The ring of fire from the Pacific Ocean all the way around from Asia to the tip of Chile has triggered everywhere in the last decade but key plates off California.
[01:12:50.293 --> 01:12:51.033]  And in California.
[01:12:52.774 --> 01:12:56.956]  And I've been listening to this fella on Coast to Coast AM for, I don't know, 15 years, 20 years.
[01:12:57.777 --> 01:12:59.037]  I've read some of his work.
[01:12:59.838 --> 01:13:05.061]  He's really... We've had volcanologists on, we've had seismologists on, and they're all getting government funding.
[01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:08.022]  So they're very careful about what they say.
[01:13:09.543 --> 01:13:13.305]  But basically, everything I hear them saying now, I heard five years ago from Scandia.
[01:13:14.278 --> 01:13:16.740]  And if you go to the last interview we did, in fact, what was the name of it?
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:20.523]  Somebody search YouTube and find it, or search our database and find the date and find it on YouTube.
[01:13:21.123 --> 01:13:22.644]  I think we have the headlines on our computer in there.
[01:13:22.864 --> 01:13:26.767]  He was on about, I don't know, a year ago, two years ago, three years ago.
[01:13:26.787 --> 01:13:28.168]  He's on intermittently.
[01:13:28.188 --> 01:13:28.869]  Let me show you one more.
[01:13:29.249 --> 01:13:30.750]  He said specifically, watch 2016.
[01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:33.152]  Watch what's going to unfold.
[01:13:34.238 --> 01:13:41.943]  And the fact that it's so overdue in California that we're going to see just one of the biggest quakes ever there, and it could bring our economy into tailspin.
[01:13:42.183 --> 01:13:45.105]  He also talked about Yellowstone a decade ago and how it's rising and falling.
[01:13:45.805 --> 01:13:53.129]  Basically everything he said, and quite frankly, even though he's well-spoken and a great guy,
[01:13:56.670 --> 01:14:05.159]  Curriculum Vitae, I would just roll my eyes and say, okay, yeah, because I don't get into the whole earth changes thing because you kind of think of this happens to somebody else.
[01:14:05.379 --> 01:14:10.385]  This happened to the Romans in Pompeii or it happened in the Pacific in Krakatoa a hundred years ago.
[01:14:12.193 --> 01:14:13.773]  And the last time he was on was over a year ago.
[01:14:14.114 --> 01:14:14.954]  Tom Flies, February 6, 2015.
[01:14:15.254 --> 01:14:27.918]  You can pull that interview up, you can hear it for yourself, but the body of his works there, the books he's written, he has predicted things more accurately than anybody I have read or talked to.
[01:14:28.278 --> 01:14:31.359]  Here's the headline, Volcanic Expert Super-Eruption Coming.
[01:14:32.919 --> 01:14:34.500]  And now you see what they're calling
[01:14:35.695 --> 01:14:36.956]  Unprecedented eruptions.
[01:14:37.116 --> 01:14:39.798]  Unprecedented geological activity.
[01:14:40.119 --> 01:14:41.320]  Tectonic activity.
[01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:43.021]  Now the sun's cooled off.
[01:14:43.081 --> 01:14:43.962]  That affects our climate.
[01:14:44.002 --> 01:14:44.662]  Is that doing it?
[01:14:45.283 --> 01:14:46.224]  Is it the magnetic field?
[01:14:46.404 --> 01:14:47.144]  He's the expert.
[01:14:47.665 --> 01:14:49.446]  Because he looks at all the studies.
[01:14:50.127 --> 01:14:50.987]  The full spectrum.
[01:14:51.027 --> 01:14:56.392]  So many experts at the university level just write their own little papers in their one little area and don't do the general research.
[01:14:56.872 --> 01:14:57.613]  Ecuador earthquake.
[01:14:57.653 --> 01:14:58.554]  Death toll rises to 350.
[01:14:58.594 --> 01:14:58.814]  Channel 9.
[01:15:04.409 --> 01:15:04.770]  Alert!
[01:15:05.090 --> 01:15:08.213]  Could a super volcano under Yellowstone National Park erupt soon?
[01:15:09.555 --> 01:15:15.001]  Aspen quakes halt Sony's senior plant.
[01:15:15.061 --> 01:15:16.603]  May impact iPhone production.
[01:15:17.839 --> 01:15:18.599]  Ecuador quake.
[01:15:18.799 --> 01:15:20.220]  Survivors tell harrowing tales.
[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:21.500]  The shaking continues.
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:25.481]  The most dangerous volcano in Mexico has erupted in spectacular fashion.
[01:15:25.721 --> 01:15:28.742]  I've got headlines that there's record volcanic activity.
[01:15:29.303 --> 01:15:32.644]  Should Northwest residents be worried about this week's back-to-back earthquakes?
[01:15:33.224 --> 01:15:38.325]  We're seeing record earthquakes since they started recording them accurately with seismographs over a hundred years ago.
[01:15:39.046 --> 01:15:40.506]  Sharp shock hits Ecuador.
[01:15:40.546 --> 01:15:41.126]  It goes on and on.
[01:15:41.406 --> 01:15:42.287]  That's just some of the news.
[01:15:42.487 --> 01:15:43.127]  You've seen it everywhere.
[01:15:43.367 --> 01:15:45.448]  So finally the mainstream media is paying attention.
[01:15:45.968 --> 01:15:46.448]  I hope
[01:15:47.096 --> 01:15:48.219]  That we've seen the worst of it.
[01:15:49.001 --> 01:15:50.464]  But the point is, we're floating around.
[01:15:51.579 --> 01:15:58.461]  On crust that is on top of molten magma on a huge planetoid going thirty-something thousand miles an hour through space.
[01:15:59.101 --> 01:16:04.363]  So when they say man-made climate change will arrest you if you disagree with it, of course there's climate change.
[01:16:04.403 --> 01:16:05.203]  It's always happening.
[01:16:05.603 --> 01:16:08.904]  Now they're saying the world has to stay the same or humans did it.
[01:16:09.564 --> 01:16:10.665]  So much ties into this.
[01:16:11.265 --> 01:16:13.326]  He's with us for the rest of the hour, five minutes to the next hour.
[01:16:13.646 --> 01:16:14.966]  Standeo.com.
[01:16:15.906 --> 01:16:17.647]  And going over his bio.
[01:16:19.326 --> 01:16:21.987]  He held an above-top-secret security clearance and worked undercover with the FBI.
[01:16:22.007 --> 01:16:26.549]  He was part of an exclusive black project specializing in the development of advanced technology.
[01:16:26.969 --> 01:16:34.232]  Stan's diverse background encompasses computer programming, marine architecture, advanced propulsion engineering, biblical studies, and earthquake forecasting.
[01:16:35.132 --> 01:16:39.674]  And I'm not going to go over all the things that he's breaking down, but we're going to get into earthquakes with him right now.
[01:16:40.174 --> 01:16:40.954]  Pretty wild stuff.
[01:16:41.274 --> 01:16:43.355]  Stan Dale, great to have you with us.
[01:16:43.375 --> 01:16:44.135]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:16:45.156 --> 01:16:46.596]  Thank you for inviting me again, Alex.
[01:16:46.956 --> 01:16:48.397]  There's certainly a lot happening to talk about.
[01:16:48.991 --> 01:16:53.275]  Well, everything you said over a year ago here, I thought it was six months ago, is basically now happening.
[01:16:53.535 --> 01:16:58.359]  Tell us what's happening from your research, what's coming next, because obviously the government and people are going to play this down.
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:04.184]  Well, there are probably good reasons for that, not that I side with the Illuminists.
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:10.985]  And they have their own agenda, but the scientific community is hamstrung.
[01:17:11.645 --> 01:17:18.612]  And if they weren't, they have the fear of causing a panic if they predict an earthquake or volcano, and it doesn't happen.
[01:17:19.313 --> 01:17:22.236]  And so they're put between a rock and a hard place to tell the public.
[01:17:22.276 --> 01:17:25.619]  And now, of course, they've got a White House muzzle on them, so they can't say anything.
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:38.415]  I have gotten information out that is not mainstream or is not even on the internet from a couple of individuals who are involved inside USGS and they have said
[01:17:39.415 --> 01:17:54.705]  That they've been making drivers, truck drivers and technicians that are delivering stuff to USGS at Yellowstone have been for the last two years to not tell anybody about it and the number of seismometers that they're putting in and the fact that they're connected to a supercomputer.
[01:17:55.145 --> 01:17:58.708]  I think they've moved it from Texas now then to Utah to the new center.
[01:17:59.768 --> 01:18:09.997]  There's a lot of effort being pointed at Yellowstone, and you can see the evidence of it in a lot of the video coming out of there that they're allowing to come out.
[01:18:10.938 --> 01:18:21.728]  And also, last month, toward the end of the month, they closed down the whole network of size monitors, you know, updating and changing and whatever, but we got no feeds at that time from them.
[01:18:23.098 --> 01:18:27.863]  And Yellowstone is only one part of our problem.
[01:18:28.344 --> 01:18:32.208]  There are other volcanoes around the planet that are starting to erupt.
[01:18:32.749 --> 01:18:37.294]  Even North Korea has asked the United States for help with one that's about to erupt there, a big one.
[01:18:38.422 --> 01:18:46.189]  And the earthquakes, well, now, you know, in the last, what, seven, eight days, we've seen a number of earthquakes.
[01:18:46.249 --> 01:18:49.812]  I'm just looking at it here on my map, which I sent to your producer.
[01:18:49.832 --> 01:18:50.332]  You can put it up.
[01:18:50.352 --> 01:18:54.556]  It shows the earthquakes over the last two weeks that are above a richer 5.5.
[01:18:57.014 --> 01:19:05.781]  And you can see in that on the western side of the Pacific, the second row right image, if you want to click on that there.
[01:19:06.341 --> 01:19:06.821]  That's the one.
[01:19:06.841 --> 01:19:07.542]  Yeah, click on that.
[01:19:08.202 --> 01:19:08.663]  There you go.
[01:19:09.463 --> 01:19:13.987]  Now, the size of the circle indicates the magnitude.
[01:19:14.227 --> 01:19:19.390]  And over Japan, which is right over here on the left side of the Ring of Fire,
[01:19:20.211 --> 01:19:27.177]  You can see that they had not only a 6.3, but a 7.2 and a bunch of aftershocks in that area.
[01:19:28.178 --> 01:19:32.962]  And over in Ecuador, you can see they had a series of 7.9 and a bunch of aftershocks.
[01:19:33.463 --> 01:19:39.268]  And in Guatemala, near Central America there, and over off the coast of Australia, up in Vanuatu.
[01:19:39.368 --> 01:19:41.930]  All around the Ring of Fire, but North America didn't get hit.
[01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:43.912]  Yeah, now that's the issue.
[01:19:43.932 --> 01:19:46.194]  I heard you talking about that before we went to the break.
[01:19:48.955 --> 01:19:54.339]  The problem with this is that it's not only California, it's the whole West Coast that hasn't released.
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:20:01.164]  And we know that up near Oregon and Washington, in the Juan de Fuca plate, that little kind of reddish area outlined there.
[01:20:01.244 --> 01:20:03.046]  Stay there, stand over, we're coming right back to you.
[01:20:03.086 --> 01:20:04.487]  You'll have the floor to break this down.
[01:20:04.847 --> 01:20:07.309]  If you're a radio listener, Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:20:07.349 --> 01:20:09.611]  You can see all these graphics for yourself.
[01:20:18.308 --> 01:20:31.338]  44,000 plus people have evacuated the Japanese town of Mashiki on the southern portion of the Land of the Rising Sun following a 7.4 magnitude earthquake that has killed at least nine and injured 858.
[01:20:31.618 --> 01:20:38.202]  If you have been paying attention, you may have noticed the frequency of earthquakes being reported in 2016 has been unyielding.
[01:20:40.504 --> 01:20:44.528]  Recently, a magnitude 6.5 earthquake hit Vanuatu.
[01:20:44.868 --> 01:20:48.512]  A magnitude 5.9 earthquake hit the southern Philippines.
[01:20:48.852 --> 01:20:52.095]  A magnitude 6.9 earthquake rocked Myanmar.
[01:20:52.296 --> 01:20:57.741]  And on April 10th, a 6.6 magnitude quake hit Kabul with aftershocks in India.
[01:20:57.941 --> 01:21:02.245]  On April 8th, there was a magnitude 4.2 earthquake in Nepal.
[01:21:02.565 --> 01:21:08.791]  Nepal was also hit earlier with a large 5.5 magnitude quake on February 22nd.
[01:21:09.091 --> 01:21:12.735]  And in the beginning of 2016, on January 20th, there was a 6.1 magnitude earthquake in China.
[01:21:12.815 --> 01:21:16.298]  And 16 days prior, 11 people had died when a 6.7 magnitude earthquake hit Manipur in India.
[01:21:24.005 --> 01:21:31.327]  Michael Snyder of End of the American Dream writes, Why is the crust of the Earth shaking so violently all of a sudden?
[01:21:31.707 --> 01:21:44.311]  Seismologist Bill Hamm of the University of Colorado has made headlines all over the world by warning that current conditions might trigger at least four earthquakes greater than 8.0 in magnitude.
[01:21:44.791 --> 01:21:46.712]  If his projections are accurate,
[01:21:47.012 --> 01:21:55.337]  Our planet could be on the precipice of a wave of natural disasters unlike anything that any of us have ever experienced before.
[01:21:55.557 --> 01:21:59.880]  Basically, what we saw in Japan earlier today is tiny.
[01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:07.064]  Compared to the destruction, Bilham has been desperately trying to compel governments all over the globe to be aware of.
[01:22:07.324 --> 01:22:12.345]  But Bilham has been turned away from at least one country that refused to hear the truth.
[01:22:12.665 --> 01:22:18.307]  In 2012, Indian officials deported Bilham when his plane arrived in New Delhi.
[01:22:18.327 --> 01:22:18.387]  Why?
[01:22:18.947 --> 01:22:26.329]  Bilham had raised concerns about the dangerous seismic activity in the Jaipur region where a nuclear plant was being planned.
[01:22:26.769 --> 01:22:32.211]  Meanwhile, authorities are quietly racing to monitor the many volcanoes blowing their tops.
[01:22:32.651 --> 01:22:37.975]  Currently, there are 38 active volcanoes as the Earth moves through its volcano season.
[01:22:38.115 --> 01:22:44.680]  The World Net Daily writes, there is a 5% to a 10% chance in the next 80 years, scientists say.
[01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:54.247]  One of these eruptions will kill millions of people and poison the atmosphere beyond the imagination of anything man's activity could do in a thousand years.
[01:22:54.647 --> 01:22:59.471]  And no one is yet making any plans to deal with the calamitous possibilities.
[01:23:00.731 --> 01:23:03.252]  But earthquakes are earthquakes and I don't know.
[01:23:03.732 --> 01:23:05.532]  Hopefully we just won't ever have to worry about it.
[01:23:05.872 --> 01:23:08.613]  How does that make you feel living here and running a business here?
[01:23:08.633 --> 01:23:11.734]  It just feels kind of awkward.
[01:23:12.434 --> 01:23:13.774]  I didn't know about that fault.
[01:23:14.975 --> 01:23:18.055]  We've had earthquakes here in the last two or three months that weren't as big as this.
[01:23:19.536 --> 01:23:23.637]  But I'm just happy that I have a building that I know that can withstand it.
[01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:33.376]  Relatively unknown fault line that was here and you can see where the road has just separated into.
[01:23:34.216 --> 01:23:36.959]  It was pushed up against each other directly in this area.
[01:23:37.039 --> 01:23:41.323]  Sidewalks are about three feet high in some places.
[01:23:42.665 --> 01:23:54.293]  True to California fashion, some of the children have seen this as their opportunity to have their own makeshift bike ramps and skate ramps, trying to make the best of this situation.
[01:23:54.573 --> 01:24:03.579]  All eyes should be on the ring of fire as the trenches activate the tectonic plates at exponential levels and earthquake news events multiply.
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:05.741]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[01:24:15.834 --> 01:24:20.138]  We're on a very active planet with a changing climate, changing tectonic forces.
[01:24:20.158 --> 01:24:35.972]  Stan Dao, who has been accurately predicting earthquakes for decades and really been warning folks that we're building towards a huge crescendo, now word for word what he said I've seen in CBS News, you name it, scientists warn of the big one to hit California.
[01:24:35.992 --> 01:24:39.535]  And if you just joined us and you're a radio listener, he's showing
[01:24:40.436 --> 01:24:53.084]  From the USGS and other bodies, maps of the record level of very strong earthquakes the last few weeks, all around the Ring of Fire, where the big plates come together, but nothing hitting
[01:24:54.795 --> 01:24:59.657]  The northern area of North America or the southern area, that entire plate line.
[01:24:59.757 --> 01:25:04.739]  So, fears are the big one as seven major earthquakes strike the Pacific region in just 96 hours.
[01:25:05.519 --> 01:25:08.860]  He was on a year ago talking about how it's weird that nothing's hitting the West Coast.
[01:25:09.881 --> 01:25:11.141]  Is something going on here?
[01:25:11.161 --> 01:25:13.342]  Is this being artificially manipulated and held back?
[01:25:13.362 --> 01:25:21.805]  I know they, Secretary of Defense Cohen in 98 told a press conference, it was in the Army Times, that they have tectonic weapons, but I don't want to go too far.
[01:25:22.326 --> 01:25:23.106]  Let's get back to what,
[01:25:23.826 --> 01:25:32.377]  What you were getting into, just as we went to break, Mr. Dayo, this is a short segment, long segment coming up, you were getting into this plate, nothing's happening, and why that's so troubling.
[01:25:33.402 --> 01:25:43.829]  Okay, all around the Ring of Fire over the last 57 years, there have been major releases of stresses that have been building up along the Ring of Fire, where these little red lines are here on the image I've got.
[01:25:43.869 --> 01:25:45.650]  Those are the edges of the tectonic plates.
[01:25:46.450 --> 01:25:55.276]  But scientists all over the world have noticed that there's a big gap in the northern hemisphere part of the Pacific Rim Plate.
[01:25:56.107 --> 01:26:00.351]  That is not releasing the seismic tension that's building up.
[01:26:01.232 --> 01:26:02.834]  And that is north of California.
[01:26:03.154 --> 01:26:07.259]  The bottom part of it comes down to the northern part of California in the Juan de Fuca Plate.
[01:26:08.271 --> 01:26:15.078]  It is building up so that when it releases, it might release as much as a 9.2 Richter earthquake.
[01:26:15.659 --> 01:26:20.124]  Now, where it is situated, it would cause flooding down in California coast.
[01:26:20.184 --> 01:26:22.926]  It would cause tsunamis that would hit over into Japan.
[01:26:22.946 --> 01:26:30.274]  It would force a local tsunami to go maybe 160 miles up into Oregon through river valleys and things.
[01:26:31.315 --> 01:26:42.419]  It's a very precipitous situation, and that could then trigger the numerous faults that run parallel to the San Andreas, plus the San Andreas, and start breaking California up into islands.
[01:26:43.179 --> 01:26:54.043]  So I can understand why, you know, no one comes out and officially says this, because it would impact the economy of the United States, and the world for that matter, very negatively if the panic started.
[01:26:54.623 --> 01:26:56.524]  But they have been doing the right thing, saying, well,
[01:26:58.185 --> 01:27:08.777]  Well, in the next 30 to 50 years, there's a 10% chance, or maybe a bit more, of a Richter 8 to 9 earthquake striking the Northwest United States coastline.
[01:27:09.377 --> 01:27:18.788]  And they're trying to tell the people that think and look ahead, maybe you better do that, maybe you better get prepared and get out of there, or at least be able to weather something like
[01:27:19.008 --> 01:27:25.331]  Sure, but you've been saying this for years, but now it's come out that a lot of top seismologists and volcanologists are afraid of having their funding cut.
[01:27:25.351 --> 01:27:26.971]  They're being told, don't panic the public.
[01:27:27.211 --> 01:27:30.533]  Plus, if, thank God, it doesn't happen, then they, quote, get discredited.
[01:27:30.573 --> 01:27:32.233]  But we saw the tsunami in Japan.
[01:27:32.714 --> 01:27:36.255]  We've seen the tsunamis before that kill hundreds of thousands in Asia.
[01:27:36.675 --> 01:27:38.056]  I mean, we're due for this.
[01:27:38.516 --> 01:27:43.658]  And a lot of seismologists, as you know, are saying they think it's a lot closer and is basically imminent.
[01:27:44.078 --> 01:27:45.419]  From your research and your sources,
[01:27:46.607 --> 01:27:47.230]  Is it imminent?
[01:27:47.290 --> 01:27:48.093]  Is it 10 years off?
[01:27:48.113 --> 01:27:48.836]  What's really happening?
[01:27:53.391 --> 01:27:55.372]  When you say imminent, do you mean this year?
[01:27:55.572 --> 01:27:56.392]  I don't know.
[01:27:56.892 --> 01:28:00.953]  There are certainly peculiar signals I'm getting in the research I've been doing.
[01:28:00.973 --> 01:28:17.518]  If you go back to my show images page, second row middle image, and click on that, you can see the first one I've published on the internet here in a number of years where I've been trying to find a way to predict the big earthquakes a day, two, three days before they happen.
[01:28:18.058 --> 01:28:21.580]  And we see Seismic Forecast Japan, beta test version.
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:23.561]  I know that's when George Norrie has you on a lot.
[01:28:23.901 --> 01:28:27.322]  You have been accurate, I'd say, what, about 80% of the time.
[01:28:27.342 --> 01:28:27.942]  It's pretty scary.
[01:28:28.523 --> 01:28:32.725]  Yeah, and that was when I had access to the naval beta at Monterey, California.
[01:28:32.845 --> 01:28:37.727]  When they changed over the programs and the satellites and everything, they didn't do that report to the public anymore.
[01:28:37.767 --> 01:28:39.848]  And that's what scares me, is they're shutting all the data down.
[01:28:41.633 --> 01:28:45.737]  Well, probably with good intent because I'm a wild card.
[01:28:45.897 --> 01:28:47.939]  I'm not financed by anybody but me and the good Lord.
[01:28:48.159 --> 01:28:51.982]  And, you know, I'll say what I think and I'll report what I see.
[01:28:52.342 --> 01:29:03.032]  And so if they let me use official naval data and explain how I was doing it and predict massive quakes, if I predicted this massive quake somewhere,
[01:29:04.452 --> 01:29:07.053]  It would be the same as them saying it, and they don't want to panic.
[01:29:07.113 --> 01:29:09.673]  They've got their own agenda for timing and release of the information.
[01:29:09.733 --> 01:29:11.394]  So, I can understand.
[01:29:11.534 --> 01:29:16.615]  You know, I'm not mad, but I found another place to get some of the information I used to use from the Navy.
[01:29:17.215 --> 01:29:24.957]  If you look at this image you've got there, that seismic forecast, you can see that yellow circle around the lower part of the island.
[01:29:24.977 --> 01:29:25.897]  Put that back up, yes.
[01:29:26.747 --> 01:29:35.038]  Okay, well now, you can see that there's kind of green and pink signals over the southern island of Japan.
[01:29:35.078 --> 01:29:40.946]  That's where we had those two big earthquakes on the outside of that circle, and it's moving upward on the islands of Japan.
[01:29:41.952 --> 01:29:43.433]  So, there's more coming.
[01:29:43.713 --> 01:29:45.653]  Alright, we got a long 18-minute segment coming up.
[01:29:45.673 --> 01:30:00.798]  We're gonna come back, give you the floor to really break down the numbers and where the most dangerous places in the world are, where you believe the next big ones are coming, but it doesn't matter if it's in Northern Europe, it doesn't matter where it is, Russia, Oklahoma, there's just earthquakes everywhere where you never had.
[01:30:01.278 --> 01:30:02.879]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.799 --> 01:30:06.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:32:12.357 --> 01:32:18.278]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:32:18.499 --> 01:32:32.663]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights,
[01:32:33.263 --> 01:32:35.224]  We're focusing on fighting the globalists.
[01:32:35.585 --> 01:32:43.410]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds and the weight's going off even faster.
[01:32:43.610 --> 01:32:50.735]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.

[01:33:32.065 --> 01:33:35.007]  Here's a parallel because it ties into seismic activity.
[01:33:35.447 --> 01:33:46.253]  For some reason, you can search into this, there are maps put out by universities showing power generating nuclear reactors around the world.
[01:33:46.293 --> 01:33:53.577]  There's really about 600 of them, 400 plus that are used for industrial use for powering cities.
[01:33:53.597 --> 01:33:57.139]  Of course, there's a lot of other classified ones as well.
[01:33:58.079 --> 01:34:00.781]  I mean, the University of Texas has a old shutdown
[01:34:02.269 --> 01:34:03.290]  Atomic reactor.
[01:34:03.731 --> 01:34:06.513]  I'm not a nuclear physicist, but, I mean, they admit it's there.
[01:34:06.894 --> 01:34:09.616]  The smokestack down there in UT, it goes down to it.
[01:34:11.918 --> 01:34:12.799]  It's a steam stack.
[01:34:13.740 --> 01:34:20.245]  And they got another, one of the biggest research reactors in the world, is at the J.J.
[01:34:20.285 --> 01:34:25.009]  Pickles Center, and I tell people that and get emails saying, there's not reactors in Austin, you're making that up.
[01:34:26.090 --> 01:34:28.833]  You can go to UT's website and take a look, see it.
[01:34:30.748 --> 01:34:33.069]  And by the way, we're on the Balcones fault line.
[01:34:33.449 --> 01:34:39.192]  There are five different extinct or dormant volcanoes that are the hills of Austin.
[01:34:40.533 --> 01:34:46.255]  In South Austin, about two miles from where I sit, it looks like a Star Trek episode or something.
[01:34:47.116 --> 01:34:48.156]  It's beautiful, amazing.
[01:34:49.557 --> 01:34:52.378]  At a state park over there that's a volcano caldera.
[01:34:53.278 --> 01:34:53.979]  The park's in.
[01:34:54.983 --> 01:35:00.365]  And so I have some selfish questions for Stan Dale in a moment about, we're seeing a lot of stuff happen.
[01:35:00.765 --> 01:35:04.386]  We're seeing a lot of things with the fault lines that are in the middle of the country.
[01:35:05.846 --> 01:35:09.848]  But I want to ask the question, why do they seem to build the reactors on fault lines?
[01:35:10.768 --> 01:35:14.249]  Well, is it that most of the population, 70% of the population lives on coastlines?
[01:35:14.489 --> 01:35:15.509]  Those tend to be fault lines?
[01:35:17.591 --> 01:35:20.633]  The tectonic plates are driving up land, so it's out of the ocean?
[01:35:20.653 --> 01:35:21.813]  I mean, I guess that's it.
[01:35:21.853 --> 01:35:25.235]  Maybe I've answered my own question, but why do you build them on fault lines?
[01:35:25.255 --> 01:35:28.456]  Why don't you build them, you know, out away from that and then have the power come in?
[01:35:28.476 --> 01:35:33.779]  We'll talk to Standeo, Standeo.com, best-selling author, filmmaker, you name it, here in just a moment.
[01:35:33.819 --> 01:35:34.760]  So much more he covers.
[01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:39.242]  We're just getting into the situation with the earthquakes here because he has been proven
[01:35:40.530 --> 01:35:41.490]  He knows what he's talking about.
[01:35:42.111 --> 01:35:47.832]  And so many times it is, you know, someone just out there doing their own research that gets it right because the establishment just won't do their job.
[01:35:47.852 --> 01:35:54.214]  But before I go any further, it will end today because I don't want to sell out of it because it'll be over a month before we get more in.
[01:35:54.895 --> 01:35:57.175]  We came out with a very powerful nootropic a year ago.
[01:35:57.695 --> 01:36:01.056]  It's got 4.9 reviews at Power Reviews and other third-party sites.
[01:36:01.617 --> 01:36:05.598]  It's got the very best organic, healthy things that boost your brain.
[01:36:06.991 --> 01:36:08.832]  They give me so much energy when I need it.
[01:36:08.932 --> 01:36:09.893]  It's just amazing.
[01:36:09.933 --> 01:36:11.114]  Good, clean energy.
[01:36:12.054 --> 01:36:12.674]  Brain Force.
[01:36:13.455 --> 01:36:16.437]  Normally, 25% off retail.
[01:36:16.497 --> 01:36:18.058]  It's not 25% off sales price.
[01:36:18.298 --> 01:36:19.699]  That's 45% off retail.
[01:36:20.259 --> 01:36:19.699]  $22.
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:23.521]  Believe me, comparable stuff is $60.
[01:36:23.921 --> 01:36:26.263]  And it's not even as good a formula.
[01:36:26.303 --> 01:36:27.483]  There's a lot of formulas out there.
[01:36:27.503 --> 01:36:31.086]  And quite frankly, we set out to have the very best and make it super affordable.
[01:36:31.666 --> 01:36:32.526]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:36:33.973 --> 01:36:35.374]  That will end, though, today.
[01:36:35.394 --> 01:36:40.657]  I said it in yesterday, but I'm extending it because a lot of folks have asked us to extend it.
[01:36:40.738 --> 01:36:44.000]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, DNAForce.
[01:36:46.461 --> 01:36:49.623]  The game changer of game changers is back in stock.
[01:36:50.526 --> 01:36:55.748]  And now it's had another key acid compound that's very healthy added to it that aids in the upload of it.
[01:36:55.808 --> 01:36:57.169]  We're going to our guest here in just one moment.
[01:36:57.729 --> 01:37:05.273]  DNA Force is loaded with the patented Bio-PQ-3 compound, which is the only one recognized by the FDA, I should add, as true Bio-PQ-3.
[01:37:05.773 --> 01:37:07.794]  All the other stuff is not yet, I'm just going to tell you.
[01:37:08.034 --> 01:37:09.995]  And it's like $45 a bottle for the fake stuff.
[01:37:10.775 --> 01:37:16.918]  Again, DNA Force is loaded with the patented Bio-PQ-3 compound, which is backed by 175 clinical studies and is extremely hard to secure.
[01:37:18.370 --> 01:37:20.872]  That's why we can talk about it, because it's a certified true nutraceutical.
[01:37:20.892 --> 01:37:22.053]  We can actually make claims with this.
[01:37:23.194 --> 01:37:31.981]  And again, just the amount in this bottle of real BioPQQ, folks, is $30 to $50 to $60 when it's the real thing.
[01:37:32.022 --> 01:37:33.603]  And this is a whole bunch of other stuff together.
[01:37:33.803 --> 01:37:34.804]  That's why it's so important.
[01:37:34.824 --> 01:37:35.925]  And it's a huge discount.
[01:37:36.165 --> 01:37:37.166]  We have products for $9.95 at Infowarslife.com.
[01:37:37.186 --> 01:37:37.386]  This is $134.
[01:37:37.426 --> 01:37:38.707]  Leading nutraceutical competitors are $300 to $500 to $600.
[01:37:38.747 --> 01:37:39.248]  That's just the markup.
[01:37:39.268 --> 01:37:40.689]  People go to doctors to get this.
[01:37:46.934 --> 01:37:52.635]  Because you have to actually have doctors involved to even be able to get it in civilian manufacturing, even though it's not prescription.
[01:37:52.675 --> 01:37:53.356]  I want to explain that.
[01:37:53.636 --> 01:37:56.816]  It comes from the actual pharmaceutical companies.
[01:37:57.917 --> 01:37:59.277]  This is from Mitsubishi America.
[01:37:59.477 --> 01:38:01.017]  Just the Bio PQQ.
[01:38:02.518 --> 01:38:04.038]  Okay, I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:38:04.158 --> 01:38:06.339]  CoQ10 of the highest quality source.
[01:38:06.919 --> 01:38:13.400]  Digestive enzymes, immune-boosting astragalus root, pomegranate extract, plant-based resveratrol, and more.
[01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:15.101]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:38:16.591 --> 01:38:20.613]  Read what it does to your mitochondrial structures, your engines, and your cells.
[01:38:21.013 --> 01:38:27.036]  Read what it is admitted to do with your DNA, with your telomeres.
[01:38:27.756 --> 01:38:30.997]  This is the only thing, BioPQQ, that they've proven.
[01:38:32.098 --> 01:38:32.358]  Okay?
[01:38:33.178 --> 01:38:37.100]  One dose of it is the equivalent of 500 cartons of blueberries.
[01:38:38.086 --> 01:38:38.707]  to get the same amount.
[01:38:38.747 --> 01:38:40.309]  This is the stuff that's in the comments.
[01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:41.611]  Not of this world.
[01:38:41.631 --> 01:38:42.472]  They don't understand it.
[01:38:42.532 --> 01:38:43.974]  They know it's just, it's amazing.
[01:38:44.735 --> 01:38:45.796]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:38:45.997 --> 01:38:47.499]  The Japanese have figured out how to make it.
[01:38:48.715 --> 01:38:49.575]  They've got the patents.
[01:38:50.416 --> 01:38:53.057]  Everything else, again, it's produced by Mitsubishi America right here.
[01:38:53.397 --> 01:38:55.678]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com.
[01:38:56.039 --> 01:38:57.899]  Survival Shield X2 is a game changer as well.

[01:39:08.525 --> 01:39:14.527]  Okay, Stan, for the balance of the hour and five minutes next, thank you for holding, joining us here via video Skype from your offices.
[01:39:14.547 --> 01:39:15.208]  You've got the floor.
[01:39:16.095 --> 01:39:23.320]  It's hard for me not to jump in here, but just give us your presentation, where you think this is going, what's going to happen, and what you were breaking down before we went to break.
[01:39:24.361 --> 01:39:25.562]  Okay, let's address a couple things.
[01:39:25.622 --> 01:39:35.529]  First of all, Fukushima is on that image I had your producer pull up there, the second row for the second image, and I'll be addressing that.
[01:39:36.289 --> 01:39:38.451]  Now, this image shows
[01:39:40.373 --> 01:39:41.433]  Two yellow circles.
[01:39:41.533 --> 01:39:56.077]  The one on the bottom left over Japan shows a circle around areas that have little green and red flashes or hot spots that I found when I used the method I used to determine earthquakes in advance.
[01:39:56.758 --> 01:39:57.578]  Now in that circle
[01:39:58.404 --> 01:40:04.027]  There's kind of a dark area from the left side of the circle over to the right between these two colored areas, and that's seabed.
[01:40:04.628 --> 01:40:05.568]  That's ocean.
[01:40:06.148 --> 01:40:08.910]  And that island has been split up there by an old fault.
[01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:13.593]  Now when they say in Kyushu that they're thinking the island may be split in half,
[01:40:14.113 --> 01:40:23.181]  There's good reason for that, because that discoloration line goes through Kyushu, which is outside the circle there in the lower left, and goes right on up into the circle area.
[01:40:23.681 --> 01:40:30.347]  So I suspect that we will see more disastrous splitting of Kyushu over the next couple years.
[01:40:30.367 --> 01:40:36.313]  In fact, over the next six to seven years, I think we're going to see great increases in earthquake and volcanic activity.
[01:40:36.933 --> 01:40:39.676]  Now go up that picture to the second yellow circle.
[01:40:40.563 --> 01:40:40.783]  I don't
[01:40:56.607 --> 01:41:10.950]  Whether I'm seeing leakages of heat from the Fukushima situation, because in that yellow circle at the top of Japan there, or say in the middle, you see a large black area surrounded by little colorful rainbow things around the edge of it.
[01:41:11.290 --> 01:41:14.871]  And out in the ocean, you see two more of those that are smaller.
[01:41:15.551 --> 01:41:22.593]  And I'm wondering if what I'm seeing there is anomalous heating from the Fukushima reactor water dumping into the Pacific there.
[01:41:24.622 --> 01:41:25.443]  That's enough on that.
[01:41:25.523 --> 01:41:33.687]  What I want to get back to is your statement about why they build the reactors where they do on the fault lines.
[01:41:34.267 --> 01:41:42.111]  One of the things that's necessary with a nuclear reactor is you've got to cool the rods to get the heat energy to get steam.
[01:41:42.911 --> 01:41:43.871]  To produce power.
[01:41:44.131 --> 01:41:50.133]  And so you need to have a flow of low-temperature, clean water coming past and through your reactor.
[01:41:50.333 --> 01:41:51.874]  So they build them close to streams.
[01:41:52.094 --> 01:41:52.474]  Okay.
[01:41:52.894 --> 01:41:59.316]  The streams form in areas and depressions, basically, where there are fractures in the Earth's crust underneath.
[01:41:59.536 --> 01:42:00.676]  You know, little fault lines.
[01:42:01.656 --> 01:42:06.258]  Now, when you do that, of course, it's darned if you do, darned if you don't.
[01:42:06.278 --> 01:42:07.658]  When you cool a reactor, that's good.
[01:42:07.698 --> 01:42:10.019]  But when you're sitting near a fault line, that's bad.
[01:42:11.465 --> 01:42:21.349]  They weighed the cost to the environment of chemical fuels and hydrocarbons and things versus doing it this way and solving it later.
[01:42:21.949 --> 01:42:26.911]  I don't know how they're going to solve the problem of getting rid of all the nuclear waste, but that's that issue.
[01:42:28.451 --> 01:42:40.764]  Something that people may not, in fact I'm pretty sure aren't aware of, is there are new papers in physics, two or three of them coming out now, which are making the universe a lot younger.
[01:42:41.105 --> 01:42:46.530]  Not saying 6,000 years, but I'm saying a lot younger than we thought in terms of 15 billion years.
[01:42:47.612 --> 01:42:48.212]  It's a simple thing.
[01:42:49.176 --> 01:42:56.620]  In physics, if you have, like, sound, and you speak in the air, and that sound will travel at 1,100 feet per second.
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:59.362]  And air is kind of light, you know, not very dense.
[01:42:59.962 --> 01:43:07.386]  But if you take that same sound and put it through a solid bar of nickel, it'll travel at five times that speed, at 5,500 feet per second, roughly.
[01:43:08.426 --> 01:43:14.870]  Now, it says that the more dense the medium that carries the wave is, the faster the wave goes.
[01:43:15.871 --> 01:43:19.875]  Now, the Big Bang, remember how they're all talking about Hawking's and the rest of it?
[01:43:19.895 --> 01:43:28.182]  In the beginning there was this little bitty tiny space in the middle of nothing, which was where all the universe was stored.
[01:43:28.522 --> 01:43:31.285]  And then there was, boom, the Big Bang, and it expanded out.
[01:43:32.146 --> 01:43:33.207]  Well, think about this.
[01:43:33.427 --> 01:43:38.471]  It was so incredibly dense, it was at least 30 million times maybe more dense than it is now.
[01:43:38.491 --> 01:43:41.034]  It was going a lot faster at the beginning, so things are slowing down.
[01:43:41.607 --> 01:43:50.129]  And so when you date the universe and you date rocks and things by radiometric methods, which depend on the speed of light being constant, they're all up to shoot.
[01:43:50.569 --> 01:43:53.429]  You have to use an exponential curve and apply that to your figures.
[01:43:54.069 --> 01:44:00.210]  So I'm going to say I'm one of those nuts that agree with the Bible scholars saying, you know, 6,000 years.
[01:44:00.230 --> 01:44:01.651]  Well, they're talking about from the Garden of Eden.
[01:44:01.711 --> 01:44:03.131]  No, not for the whole age of the Earth.
[01:44:03.531 --> 01:44:08.172]  But the Earth, I'd say, is probably less than 50,000 years, maybe even less than that.
[01:44:08.752 --> 01:44:09.932]  Well, Stan, let me just say this.
[01:44:10.052 --> 01:44:11.253]  I mean, I'm a Christian myself.
[01:44:11.753 --> 01:44:20.155]  I disagree with some of the Bible scholars' interpretation on things and then making a big fight with science when so much of the Bible is proven by science.
[01:44:20.195 --> 01:44:29.178]  But mainline science, who isn't even debating us on this with Shoemaker-Levy in the comments, they now admit, OK, we're not getting hit every few million years by big asteroids.
[01:44:29.418 --> 01:44:30.278]  We're getting hit every 50,000, 100,000, 200,000.
[01:44:30.478 --> 01:44:31.778]  They can now see the craters all over the earth.
[01:44:34.798 --> 01:44:43.623]  It's mainline science, you're right, is now admitting that because of the way that they're dating things, because it was moving faster at the beginning, I mean, that's mainline science, you're right.
[01:44:44.104 --> 01:44:57.272]  Mainline supercomputers are now finding dark matter outside dimension that's much more energetic than even ours, saying we may be a side dimension, not actually, let's say, the most energy dominant.
[01:44:58.151 --> 01:45:01.152]  There's an outside energy field holding everything together.
[01:45:01.832 --> 01:45:05.193]  Top scientists say it's like we're a simulation in the mind of God.
[01:45:05.233 --> 01:45:14.075]  And so a lot of atheists, top mathematicians and others are actually beginning religion and genetic engineers are getting religion as they look into things and see how designed it is.
[01:45:14.416 --> 01:45:18.837]  This didn't just come together like a Swiss watch out in the desert, as a lot of Christians point out.
[01:45:18.857 --> 01:45:19.557]  So I hear what you're saying.
[01:45:20.037 --> 01:45:26.279]  Clearly, they go, when you go to the Grand Canyon, they'll have a geologist go, over a billion years, the water cut through here.
[01:45:27.119 --> 01:45:39.562]  Well, I'm no hydrologist, but I live in Austin, Texas, where they admit that the canyons and things are formed because of underground rivers on the fault lines that are in Austin from the earthquakes.
[01:45:39.602 --> 01:45:46.343]  They even admit that there, and that exactly, that's what forms a lot of these cliffs and streams, isn't millions of years of the stream.
[01:45:46.803 --> 01:45:54.625]  There's a crack in the ground, underground rivers, that's what's cutting through, is the underground rivers and the seismic activity.
[01:45:55.345 --> 01:46:14.085]  But the thing is, real scientists admit that, but when they tell the public, they tell you it's four or five billion years, that's why the Grand Canyon did this, they're actually pushing an agenda, when they actually, you talk to anybody, they go, no, evolution's not like they teach, yeah, the Earth isn't like they teach, they've been teaching this, it looks like a lie on purpose.
[01:46:14.245 --> 01:46:15.787]  Do you agree with that, and what's the agenda?
[01:46:17.059 --> 01:46:17.900]  Well, I agree with that.
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:28.449]  And the agenda is, I think it is a massive deception of the people of the world to make them think there's a gradualism, you know, to everything and it takes millions of years.
[01:46:28.549 --> 01:46:41.380]  And, you know, obviously the biblical tales couldn't be true because, you know, it had took billions of years for man and Neanderthal and all this Homo sapiens and all the derivative things.
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:43.742]  So, therefore, they don't want you to look at
[01:46:44.741 --> 01:46:50.185]  That the history of Earth in the form of what's called catastrophism, catastrophic things happen.
[01:46:50.745 --> 01:46:59.912]  And I'm telling you, I'm telling you and your listeners here, Alex, believe me today, that the Garden of Eden was only back about 6,000 years, I found it.
[01:47:00.552 --> 01:47:02.253]  The Atlantis, I have found that.
[01:47:02.273 --> 01:47:04.115]  That was back only about 5,000 years.
[01:47:04.155 --> 01:47:08.198]  I know where it is today and how big it is and I even found where the capital island is now.
[01:47:08.218 --> 01:47:12.681]  Well, Plato, they found almost everything Plato wrote about 2,300 years ago.
[01:47:12.741 --> 01:47:13.922]  He was a mainline historian.
[01:47:15.130 --> 01:47:16.051]  And he said it existed.
[01:47:16.412 --> 01:47:21.718]  And we'll have you back about all this, because I know there's a lot of ancient civilizations, things you have found, and others have found.
[01:47:21.738 --> 01:47:22.819]  They're having to admit this now.
[01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:25.983]  But specifically, was Plato right about Atlantis' location?
[01:47:26.898 --> 01:47:27.919]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[01:47:28.019 --> 01:47:42.375]  What was incorrect was what the translators, or the people who read the translations of Jallet, how they read where the Pillars of Hercules were, because they all talk about the Pillars of Hercules being the gateway to Atlantis.
[01:47:42.616 --> 01:47:44.418]  And the Masons are obsessed with the two pillars.
[01:47:45.635 --> 01:47:46.035]  And who are?
[01:47:46.155 --> 01:47:48.616]  Oh, Mason, yeah, right, right, they are, Boaz and Joaquin.
[01:47:49.056 --> 01:48:06.202]  Now, but it's in another part of Plato's account, it says that the Straits of Hercules, and the Straits, there's a small waterway that joins two great oceans, and I found the real Straits of Hercules, and they're on the border between Syria and Turkey.
[01:48:07.002 --> 01:48:10.423]  And I'll show this in a lecture I'm giving in July in Colorado Springs.
[01:48:10.904 --> 01:48:11.664]  But on my website,
[01:48:12.483 --> 01:48:15.808]  There's just so much of this catastrophism that's important.
[01:48:15.828 --> 01:48:27.146]  The point is every ancient culture said that suddenly it'd be dark for a year and huge explosions and whether it was asteroids, volcanoes, every culture reports about just devastation and then just everybody disappearing.
[01:48:28.737 --> 01:48:37.442]  Look, let me point you to something that explains that we have been hit recently by a large, huge meteor.
[01:48:37.802 --> 01:48:44.925]  You used to think that, I'm sure, that the Chicxulub meteor that made impact in the Yucatan Peninsula and the Gulf of Mexico, that that was big.
[01:48:45.426 --> 01:48:55.211]  If you look on the first row, second image, click on that, you will see I've drawn a little red circle on the right-hand side of the picture of the impact crater of Chicxulub.
[01:48:55.911 --> 01:49:11.612]  And on the left side of India, I have drawn the yellow circle representing the diameter of the Chicxulub impact, but the red one is the impact crater that is just now trying to prove was a meteor, and I can prove it.
[01:49:12.373 --> 01:49:15.836]  It was 300 miles in diameter.
[01:49:15.856 --> 01:49:19.099]  It was 22 times the energy of the impact at Chekselab.
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:22.863]  This broke the continents of Pangea apart.
[01:49:22.943 --> 01:49:26.306]  And it was not 100 million years ago, as classical science says.
[01:49:26.726 --> 01:49:28.728]  It was less than 5,000 years ago.
[01:49:30.409 --> 01:49:34.851]  There were catastrophic things that happened and moved continents apart and shoved India up into the Himalayas.
[01:49:35.392 --> 01:49:37.713]  This is catastrophism.
[01:49:38.293 --> 01:49:41.815]  And it's not separated by millions and billions of years.
[01:49:42.435 --> 01:49:48.878]  So people cannot sit comfortably and think that we're not going to see in the next six or seven years some serious tectonic occurrences.
[01:49:49.178 --> 01:49:51.359]  Look at the top right image, top pro right image.
[01:49:51.839 --> 01:49:52.620]  This is from NASA.
[01:49:53.670 --> 01:50:00.192]  And it's an image showing the mass concentrations, you know, the variations in gravity on the surface of the Earth.
[01:50:00.972 --> 01:50:07.534]  And they cannot explain why that purple and blue one right at the base of India is short of mass.
[01:50:07.814 --> 01:50:12.795]  It's like there's a chunk taken out of the sub-Earth area there, you know, the mantle.
[01:50:12.815 --> 01:50:15.236]  I mean, if you look over in the Atlantic, in the upper right,
[01:50:15.976 --> 01:50:22.364]  You'll see there is a raised area in the middle of the Atlantic going up to Iceland.
[01:50:23.845 --> 01:50:26.168]  That area is over 2.3 million miles in area.
[01:50:32.936 --> 01:50:41.422]  And it was caused by the meteor that hit the east coast of India, over in that purple area, when India was stretched down there where it used to be.
[01:50:41.442 --> 01:50:52.970]  It went underneath Saudi Arabia and up into the Atlantic Ocean, pushing a lot of mass ahead of it, and formed the Atlantic Bulge and the Indian Ocean shortage of mass.
[01:50:53.590 --> 01:50:55.652]  That was a catastrophe that sank Atlantis.
[01:50:56.092 --> 01:50:58.534]  That was a catastrophe that caused the Great Flood of Noah.
[01:50:58.694 --> 01:51:04.579]  It is real, and people need to get into the catastrophic mode of history to understand it properly.
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:06.561]  Well, I go back to Shoemaker-Levy.
[01:51:06.581 --> 01:51:10.104]  What was the year that happened?
[01:51:10.124 --> 01:51:12.246]  But the comet broke up, hit one of the big gas giants.
[01:51:12.326 --> 01:51:13.747]  I remember even seeing it on MMI TV.
[01:51:13.787 --> 01:51:14.067]  Jupiter.
[01:51:14.688 --> 01:51:15.549]  And I had Shoemaker.
[01:51:18.715 --> 01:51:21.836]  His wife on, and then they died in a car wreck, and I've also had Levi on.
[01:51:22.296 --> 01:51:25.157]  But they had to admit, okay, you're right.
[01:51:26.257 --> 01:51:29.338]  It looks like we're getting hit by asteroids and stuff all the time.
[01:51:29.478 --> 01:51:31.978]  Huge ones, you know, on a more routine basis.
[01:51:33.459 --> 01:51:36.260]  I mean, what hit Russia, you know, back at the turn of the last century?
[01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:45.402]  We know this stuff's going on because we can now watch other planets being pounded on a routine basis by giant asteroids and comets.
[01:51:47.591 --> 01:51:59.833]  Yeah, I can see that, and we do have to admit the fact, even some of these things like the meteor that burst over that Russian town, Chiblins or whatever it is, I forget the name of it exactly, but... Chompotka or whatever?
[01:52:00.573 --> 01:52:00.913]  Say again?
[01:52:01.293 --> 01:52:02.914]  I'm going from memory, it's Chompotka?
[01:52:03.774 --> 01:52:06.334]  What's the famous one that blew trees down for hundreds of square miles?
[01:52:06.354 --> 01:52:06.934]  Oh, Tunguska.
[01:52:07.234 --> 01:52:07.694]  Tunguska.
[01:52:07.835 --> 01:52:08.115]  That's it.
[01:52:08.435 --> 01:52:08.895]  We can show that.
[01:52:08.935 --> 01:52:12.555]  My grandfather actually saw that come over the north of the United States before it exploded over Russia.
[01:52:13.055 --> 01:52:15.996]  He said it made a moaning sound, like a cow moaning or something.
[01:52:16.969 --> 01:52:17.411]  It's huge.
[01:52:18.275 --> 01:52:19.941]  Wow, keep going, sorry to interrupt.
[01:52:20.387 --> 01:52:20.807]  That's all right.
[01:52:20.847 --> 01:52:21.228]  That's all right.
[01:52:21.248 --> 01:52:22.508]  Look, there's so much to discuss.
[01:52:22.528 --> 01:52:24.750]  We're probably not going to get it all in this show.
[01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:39.199]  But I'm trying to be a digital Indiana Jones and to go and locate things with Google Earth and other data to tell the real history of Earth and the civilizations and the things I am finding.
[01:52:40.099 --> 01:52:41.340]  Let me just tell you this right now.
[01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:43.362]  I've said this already, so it's not a big secret.
[01:52:43.922 --> 01:52:48.385]  Saudi Arabia, all of the Arabian Peninsula, is the major landmass of Atlantis.
[01:52:48.985 --> 01:52:51.226]  I found the fertile plain they're talking about.
[01:52:51.266 --> 01:52:53.327]  It's 110 miles wide by 330 miles long.
[01:52:53.747 --> 01:52:57.069]  It left a scar on the surface of the earth, and I found that on NASA data.
[01:52:57.930 --> 01:53:04.373]  And the capital island of Atlantis is on the southwest coast of the Persian Gulf.
[01:53:04.393 --> 01:53:09.816]  There's three or four locations it might be at, but it's underneath water and sand and stuff.
[01:53:09.936 --> 01:53:10.716]  I think we found it.
[01:53:11.577 --> 01:53:15.899]  And I found over 1,700 stone artifacts left by the Atlanteans.
[01:53:16.676 --> 01:53:31.520]  I do believe that Noah lived in the Arabian Peninsula, was an Atlantean per se, and that the flood was caused by the impact and it did recede quicker in other parts of the earth than it did in the Arabian Peninsula.
[01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:38.842]  That's why they have all that sand and stuff, you know, 80 feet of mud and stuff in the Persian Gulf region that settled over a year's time.
[01:53:39.063 --> 01:53:40.003]  Anyway, there's just so much.
[01:53:41.123 --> 01:53:43.765]  I can't begin to tell you what I've been discovering.
[01:53:44.545 --> 01:53:45.706]  I looked at the Exodus.
[01:53:45.726 --> 01:53:46.587]  Where did it really happen?
[01:53:46.627 --> 01:53:47.227]  What happened?
[01:53:47.467 --> 01:53:51.170]  Where was Moses standing when he saw the real Mount Sinai over in Saudi Arabia?
[01:53:52.811 --> 01:53:54.852]  It's mind-blowing stuff.
[01:53:55.272 --> 01:53:57.574]  I'm going to share that as best I can in July.
[01:53:57.654 --> 01:53:58.915]  Maybe I'll write a book if there's time.
[01:53:59.535 --> 01:54:02.337]  Things are happening so quick, I often wonder if I'm going to get it out in time.
[01:54:02.677 --> 01:54:04.398]  Stan Day, you talk about things happening quick.
[01:54:04.638 --> 01:54:05.159]  It's gone from
[01:54:06.135 --> 01:54:10.217]  Our inside source is talking about the elites going into bunkers, moving to New Zealand.
[01:54:10.457 --> 01:54:13.058]  But now it's all over the New York Times, RT, you name it.
[01:54:13.458 --> 01:54:17.219]  Panicked elite, you know, moving in these billion dollar underground structures in Germany and places.
[01:54:17.819 --> 01:54:20.040]  Why are they running around like chickens with their heads cut off?
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:22.801]  Usually they say because of economic unrest.
[01:54:22.841 --> 01:54:24.702]  Lloyds of London says it's the worst ever.
[01:54:26.167 --> 01:54:27.548]  I'm not trying to be a fear monger.
[01:54:28.008 --> 01:54:30.209]  It's the establishment that's acting like it's the end of the world.
[01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:33.271]  And some people say, no Alex, political stuff is the cover.
[01:54:33.691 --> 01:54:36.793]  The elites don't care about the people anymore because they know something big's coming.
[01:54:37.734 --> 01:54:37.874]  Yeah.
[01:54:38.654 --> 01:54:39.014]  I agree.
[01:54:39.034 --> 01:54:39.755]  I agree.
[01:54:40.175 --> 01:54:41.776]  So, I'm asking you, what do you think?
[01:54:41.836 --> 01:54:43.157]  Is it economic?
[01:54:43.217 --> 01:54:43.897]  Is it military?
[01:54:43.917 --> 01:54:45.998]  Or is it a mix of earth changes?
[01:54:46.338 --> 01:54:49.020]  I mean, why are they acting like they don't even care what we think?
[01:54:50.285 --> 01:55:03.656]  Well, because, you know, all right, you're going to roll your eyes at this, but back in the late 40s, early 50s, mankind did make contact with off-world beings, with humanoids, several types.
[01:55:03.956 --> 01:55:14.605]  And when I worked for Dr. Teller at this organization down in Australia building anti-gravity craft, I got fed a lot of information about these alien critters.
[01:55:14.645 --> 01:55:18.748]  And they fit with the biblical concept of a war in the heavens coming down to Earth.
[01:55:20.269 --> 01:55:22.331]  It fits with Genesis 6 and Atlantis and all that.
[01:55:23.012 --> 01:55:29.018]  Well I just know you've been accurate about the earthquakes and you're a really smart guy and the science you talk about I know fits with the real research out there.
[01:55:29.379 --> 01:55:39.589]  I know a lot of the elites and the occults are about worshipping fallen angels and things and I know he talks about that in Noah's time so I understand there's a context to that and the media always makes fun of it but the elites
[01:55:40.370 --> 01:55:44.031]  Their creation story, even the New York Times admitted a few years ago, was the movie Prometheus.
[01:55:44.571 --> 01:55:46.932]  And so, I mean, the elites don't believe in evolution, folks.
[01:55:47.152 --> 01:55:49.993]  When you actually talk to them, they believe we were planted here.
[01:55:50.693 --> 01:55:50.893]  Yes.
[01:55:51.853 --> 01:55:52.033]  Yes.
[01:55:52.353 --> 01:55:54.114]  What's that term, trans-panspermia?
[01:55:54.134 --> 01:55:55.794]  I'll give you a yellow prompt for free.
[01:55:56.615 --> 01:55:57.675]  Panspermia, yeah, that's right.
[01:55:58.655 --> 01:56:06.197]  Some of them think that we were planted by little microbes that were on dust and particles flowing through the universe from other places that had life in it.
[01:56:06.217 --> 01:56:07.618]  Yeah, that's just ridiculous.
[01:56:07.658 --> 01:56:08.078]  I mean, folks,
[01:56:09.713 --> 01:56:23.656]  Look, you know, any thinking person, any logical person can see that the incredible, intricate, interlocked systems of humans and animals and vegetation on this planet could not have happened from one spontaneous action.
[01:56:23.676 --> 01:56:32.559]  A super ultra advanced consciousness did it, God, and then I guess the Bible says the stuff we're dealing with is a bunch of fallen scum who's just a bunch of trash.
[01:56:32.579 --> 01:56:33.639]  I don't know how you describe it.
[01:56:34.383 --> 01:56:35.143]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:56:35.343 --> 01:56:41.286]  And, look, people think that, you know, well, if God is perfect and, you know, then why do we have wars and this and that?
[01:56:41.486 --> 01:56:45.307]  But if you're reading the Scripture, God is in the middle of a war in the heavens with a rebellion.
[01:56:45.568 --> 01:56:47.068]  And Satan is the leader of that rebellion.
[01:56:47.088 --> 01:56:49.669]  And, of course, the Masons are on his side, you know, Lucifer.
[01:56:50.330 --> 01:57:00.814]  And when you have two warring factions, if God, who is, you know, the creator of all the factions, says, look, I'm going to kill everything on the earth with a flood,
[01:57:01.314 --> 01:57:05.917]  And yet some survive, some giants and bits and pieces over in the Americas, whatever, survive.
[01:57:06.417 --> 01:57:08.459]  They say, well, that can't be right because God's not perfect.
[01:57:08.499 --> 01:57:15.523]  But God is in the middle of a war with Satan, who is so intelligent that he was the covering guard over the throne of God.
[01:57:16.083 --> 01:57:21.887]  So, we're dealing with a war here of immense proportions off the planet and now on the planet.
[01:57:22.568 --> 01:57:24.449]  And I don't know any other way to say that.
[01:57:25.461 --> 01:57:26.983]  I know it sounds like Stanley.
[01:57:27.003 --> 01:57:29.646]  Well, you know I don't get into all this stuff, but here's the bottom line.
[01:57:29.706 --> 01:57:30.507]  I've studied the elite.
[01:57:30.547 --> 01:57:32.148]  I've snuck into Bohemian Grove, Skull & Bones.
[01:57:33.029 --> 01:57:37.735]  I've gotten material from Skull & Bones members exclusively here through Charlotte Isserby and others.
[01:57:37.775 --> 01:57:38.876]  His father was in it.
[01:57:39.977 --> 01:57:43.861]  They believe they are getting divine knowledge from off-world beings.
[01:57:44.778 --> 01:58:08.237]  I mean you take Galton, Wedgwood, Huxley, Darwin admitted in his full writings that he was channeled is his evolution of the species and and and you know all the rest of it and they were deep occultist and they envisioned biometrics and computers and everything they then built this modern world to control us so if they're not getting it from the devil which which liberal media outlets make fun of me when I say this but
[01:58:08.917 --> 01:58:15.303]  Half the world supposedly believes in God and the devil, so why is it bad when we take it and put a modern context to it, only for the reasons of debate?
[01:58:16.864 --> 01:58:17.665]  It's not bad.
[01:58:17.725 --> 01:58:18.726]  I mean, goodness gracious.
[01:58:18.806 --> 01:58:27.874]  I mean, we can't continue like we have been for generations, where we just blindly accept what some guy, his interpretation of history is.
[01:58:28.074 --> 01:58:34.720]  I mean, you know that whoever survives the battles writes the history, and it's colored by their input, their psyche.
[01:58:35.558 --> 01:58:36.838]  Now, we have to wake up.
[01:58:37.058 --> 01:58:37.839]  We have the internet.
[01:58:37.859 --> 01:58:40.339]  We have an increase in knowledge, like the Bible said, that is immense.
[01:58:40.939 --> 01:58:44.320]  Use that knowledge, study, to see what the truth is.
[01:58:44.540 --> 01:58:45.420]  Alright, stay right there.
[01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:46.261]  Back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:46.521 --> 01:58:51.722]  Because I'm not going to take issue with it, but I want to get into the Mason issue, because there's a lot of different factions in the Masons.
[01:58:52.042 --> 01:58:53.502]  You're a smart guy, I want to get your take on that.
[01:58:53.522 --> 01:58:59.524]  Because I know most Masons, I wouldn't say are working for the devil, but like I say, most Christians are, but there's obviously factions everywhere.
[01:59:00.814 --> 01:59:01.815]  Brain Force is here.
[01:59:02.355 --> 01:59:04.636]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:59:04.896 --> 01:59:12.720]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[01:59:13.499 --> 01:59:17.082]  One of the worst things with most energy products, this is not sustainable, right?
[01:59:17.102 --> 01:59:19.444]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[01:59:19.804 --> 01:59:23.327]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[01:59:23.367 --> 01:59:26.509]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[01:59:27.009 --> 01:59:31.793]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[01:59:32.354 --> 01:59:34.175]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[01:59:34.515 --> 01:59:38.959]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[01:59:39.119 --> 01:59:41.120]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[01:59:41.741 --> 01:59:43.202]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[01:59:43.362 --> 01:59:43.602]  Exactly.
[01:59:43.622 --> 01:59:47.425]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[01:59:47.925 --> 01:59:55.190]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:59:55.411 --> 01:59:57.112]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:13.666 --> 02:00:15.109]  We are on the march.
[02:00:15.489 --> 02:00:17.934]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:00:18.655 --> 02:00:22.281]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:32.836 --> 02:00:39.159]  We're going to turn back towards earth on what we can totally document coming up in the next segment with Phyllis Schlafly who had them try to take over Eagle Forum.
[02:00:39.839 --> 02:00:45.542]  Breaking internal campaign memo projects Trump will win 1,400 delegates at GOP convention.
[02:00:46.022 --> 02:00:48.023]  White Democrats are becoming the party of the 1%.
[02:00:48.143 --> 02:00:51.285]  We're going to be getting to a lot of key information.
[02:00:51.305 --> 02:00:52.505]  Look, here's the deal.
[02:00:52.945 --> 02:00:53.646]  I've never covered
[02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:56.430]  UFOs and all this other stuff.
[02:00:56.810 --> 02:00:58.271]  The elite are obsessed with it.
[02:00:58.371 --> 02:01:03.155]  The new X-Files character, according to Chris Carter, you know, the TV host, is based on yours truly.
[02:01:05.136 --> 02:01:08.839]  And so at a certain point I've got to start segwaying into looking at what's happening.
[02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:15.885]  The elite believe in their real cosmology that they are the heirs of this advanced future.
[02:01:16.786 --> 02:01:20.629]  And that they are going to be the advanced humans that get to go forward
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:26.164]  But first, the earth has to be cleansed of the infestation of 90% of the population.
[02:01:27.065 --> 02:01:32.870]  And the elite believe that they are communicating with these, you know, fallen angels or whatever.
[02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:34.772]  I mean, that's what goes on at Bohemian Grove.
[02:01:35.392 --> 02:01:36.794]  I never really believed in any of this stuff.
[02:01:36.934 --> 02:01:38.996]  I just want to know why the elite are so obsessed with it.
[02:01:39.196 --> 02:01:42.018]  But you look at Christian cosmology and other ancient cultures, it fits.
[02:01:42.439 --> 02:01:44.100]  Standale, standale.com is our guest.
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:46.522]  We'll have him back on to get more into the esoteric sometime.
[02:01:46.542 --> 02:01:47.924]  But specifically, let's take Mason's.
[02:01:49.147 --> 02:01:58.893]  Pre-Christianity, you know, there's the builder guilds, and you didn't just go to a university, you know, mathematics and stuff was very valuable, so it also had a lot of religious stuff mixed in with it, the mystery schools of Egypt and others.
[02:02:00.454 --> 02:02:06.017]  George Washington was a Mason, but he warned of the Illuminati taking over the Masons, and you know, in a bunch of letters, and I thought he was a great guy.
[02:02:06.437 --> 02:02:07.398]  Many of our founders were.
[02:02:08.191 --> 02:02:13.573]  So when people just say, you know, Masons are on the side of Lucifer, well, Albert Pike was a Mason.
[02:02:13.593 --> 02:02:14.313]  He certainly said that.
[02:02:14.353 --> 02:02:15.733]  He wrote that, one of the most influential.
[02:02:16.193 --> 02:02:19.134]  To me, that's a takeover, and it's kind of gone back and forth.
[02:02:19.294 --> 02:02:21.055]  Any institution can get taken over.
[02:02:21.655 --> 02:02:25.116]  I'm not a Mason, had a lot of ancestors that were Masons, who were really good people.
[02:02:25.496 --> 02:02:28.917]  So when you say that, I mean, I agree with you that modern Masonry at the top
[02:02:29.557 --> 02:02:31.620]  ...is a mystery school that worships Lucifer.
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:33.362]  That's what they learned at the 33rd degree.
[02:02:33.843 --> 02:02:36.987]  But that, to me, is a takeover of the Masonic idea.
[02:02:37.007 --> 02:02:38.609]  It's like they've taken over all these symbols.
[02:02:38.869 --> 02:02:40.752]  So in the last 2-3 minutes, what's your view on that?
[02:02:41.846 --> 02:02:42.246]  I agree.
[02:02:42.426 --> 02:02:44.247]  I've known many Freemasons in my life.
[02:02:44.427 --> 02:02:53.591]  In fact, I've been such good friends with 18th degree and above Freemasons that I have been allowed to read in their library in a number one lodge.
[02:02:54.612 --> 02:02:58.234]  I couldn't write or photograph anything, but I could memorize what I got there.
[02:02:58.694 --> 02:03:02.636]  So they respected the work I had done and what I was speaking about publicly.
[02:03:03.436 --> 02:03:08.919]  But they were not the superstructure that has taken over the Masonic guilds.
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:26.070]  Adam Weishaupt started that, realized that you could get into one of these secret societies, move up the ranks to a very high level, and then start tricking people at the higher level into a side organization that was clearly apart from the objectives of the original Masonic order.
[02:03:27.851 --> 02:03:31.293]  I don't, I don't go after, you know, people and condemn them for being Freemasons.
[02:03:31.353 --> 02:03:32.774]  A majority of them are doing good.
[02:03:32.794 --> 02:03:33.615]  I totally agree with you.
[02:03:33.635 --> 02:03:34.115]  I mean, that's it.
[02:03:34.135 --> 02:03:35.556]  I mean, George Washington was very honorable.
[02:03:35.616 --> 02:03:36.196]  He was one of them.
[02:03:36.396 --> 02:03:37.657]  And he warned it was being taken over.
[02:03:38.417 --> 02:03:39.098]  Yeah, he was right.
[02:03:39.298 --> 02:03:40.119]  He was very right.
[02:03:40.359 --> 02:03:41.739]  And, uh, what was that?
[02:03:41.820 --> 02:03:46.022]  That was around the time that Adam Weishaupt, uh, awarded Ingolstadt, you know, in Bavaria.
[02:03:46.062 --> 02:03:46.462]  That's right.
[02:03:46.482 --> 02:03:47.643]  We had our real revolution.
[02:03:47.683 --> 02:03:48.964]  They were creating a counterfeit of it.
[02:03:49.690 --> 02:03:50.050]  That's right.
[02:03:50.271 --> 02:03:50.651]  That's right.
[02:03:50.771 --> 02:03:52.532]  And there's a lot more we need to study.
[02:03:53.193 --> 02:03:56.075]  I just encourage people to do that and not to watch too much TV.
[02:03:56.095 --> 02:03:56.856]  Get into the real world.
[02:03:56.876 --> 02:03:57.016]  I agree.
[02:03:57.036 --> 02:03:57.937]  Standeo.com.
[02:03:57.957 --> 02:04:01.460]  Let's get you back in a couple months and not a year this time.
[02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:02.521]  You've got one minute left.
[02:04:02.641 --> 02:04:03.462]  Thank you so much for your time.
[02:04:04.082 --> 02:04:12.149]  When do you, just looking at all the maps, I know it's dead reckoning, but you've been proven really accurate, when do you think the big one's coming and what's the most dangerous area on the West Coast?
[02:04:13.399 --> 02:04:25.228]  Most dangerous area, I believe, is the Juan de Fuca area, and I expect that any tick of the clock, but primarily when you have a full moon or a new moon, when the gravitational stress is on the surface of the planet of the greatest.
[02:04:25.568 --> 02:04:28.270]  Jim Birkland, you know, his theory about that I do agree with.
[02:04:28.730 --> 02:04:29.891]  And we're approaching that tomorrow.
[02:04:31.032 --> 02:04:36.997]  Not that I'm saying that the great one's coming tomorrow, but the stresses are building, so watch for full moons and new moon periods.
[02:04:37.817 --> 02:04:41.041]  A day or so either side for the triggering of the Great Ones.
[02:04:41.582 --> 02:04:42.603]  And that occurs twice a month.
[02:04:43.824 --> 02:04:44.726]  What about the Midwest?
[02:04:44.746 --> 02:04:45.767]  What about places like Austin?
[02:04:45.787 --> 02:04:46.808]  What about the fault lines here?
[02:04:46.828 --> 02:04:48.050]  A lot of stuff is becoming active again.
[02:04:50.166 --> 02:04:59.709]  Well, yeah, and I think that formation there that runs across Texas was probably partly a result of the Chicxulub meteor impact down in the Gulf at the Yucatan Peninsula.
[02:05:00.150 --> 02:05:09.473]  So when the fault lines of the world start to shake, and I think it's because the core of the planet is heating up, our magnetic poles are beginning to switch, and we're going to see shortly...
[02:05:10.373 --> 02:05:13.694]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:05:13.834 --> 02:05:16.094]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:05:16.274 --> 02:05:24.657]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:05:24.917 --> 02:05:28.257]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[02:05:28.397 --> 02:05:38.700]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:46.325]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:05:46.525 --> 02:05:48.426]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[02:05:48.766 --> 02:05:56.351]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:05:56.711 --> 02:06:02.876]  Super Mill Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:06:03.177 --> 02:06:10.122]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mill Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:06:10.403 --> 02:06:20.591]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[02:06:20.791 --> 02:06:27.717]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:06:27.877 --> 02:06:32.580]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:06:46.732 --> 02:06:48.453]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[02:06:48.613 --> 02:06:53.598]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:06:53.738 --> 02:06:58.101]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:06:58.222 --> 02:07:01.484]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:07:01.625 --> 02:07:07.650]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:10.111]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:10.292 --> 02:07:11.672]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:07:11.933 --> 02:07:13.234]  You can't survive without it.
[02:07:13.414 --> 02:07:14.334]  But where do you get it?
[02:07:14.614 --> 02:07:20.378]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:07:20.618 --> 02:07:26.342]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.

[02:08:28.425 --> 02:08:31.926]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:08:32.506 --> 02:08:34.307]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:34.447 --> 02:08:42.130]  She's been one of the hardest working people when it comes to promoting Americana.
[02:08:43.110 --> 02:08:50.393]  Phyllis Schlafly, founder of Eagle Forum, best-selling author of A Choice Not An Echo, created the conservative movement.
[02:08:51.409 --> 02:08:53.730]  And carried the torch on from Barry Goldwater.
[02:08:54.250 --> 02:09:00.712]  And so much of what we have left of basic freedom in this country is due to her hard work and the Eagle Forum.
[02:09:02.213 --> 02:09:03.714]  And she's a constitutional lawyer.
[02:09:04.574 --> 02:09:06.154]  EagleForum.org.
[02:09:06.174 --> 02:09:07.695]  She's joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[02:09:09.756 --> 02:09:11.937]  Her video message is at EagleForum.org.
[02:09:13.834 --> 02:09:14.835]  And she's put this message out.
[02:09:14.875 --> 02:09:17.036]  She's now coming on the radio live to talk about it.
[02:09:17.556 --> 02:09:18.736]  A very, very sad story.
[02:09:18.756 --> 02:09:20.137]  A very, very sad chapter.
[02:09:20.157 --> 02:09:23.819]  I personally liked Ted Cruz when he was a senator.
[02:09:23.839 --> 02:09:30.522]  I had concerns about his connections to some of the more neoconnish and Rockefeller Republicans.
[02:09:30.722 --> 02:09:36.946]  I liked the Bushes and the Goldman Sachs issues and the TPP issues, but I liked what he did in the Senate overall.
[02:09:37.806 --> 02:09:39.167]  Now we've seen all the dirty tricks.
[02:09:40.523 --> 02:09:42.585]  We've seen the lying about Carson quitting.
[02:09:42.625 --> 02:09:50.191]  We've seen the going and getting him to cancel entire elections and just give him the delegates and then he calls it a landslide of the people.
[02:09:50.692 --> 02:09:53.214]  Even Sean Hannity yesterday, we played it last hour, said stop it.
[02:09:53.935 --> 02:09:55.116]  Stop saying it's a landslide.
[02:09:55.156 --> 02:09:55.896]  There was no election.
[02:09:56.477 --> 02:09:57.818]  In Colorado and many other states.
[02:09:59.239 --> 02:10:02.342]  When there was an election, Donald Trump got nearly 60% of the vote in New York.
[02:10:04.904 --> 02:10:08.287]  In the rural areas, Ted Cruz got the New York values inside the city.
[02:10:10.356 --> 02:10:12.736]  So, this is a serious issue.
[02:10:12.756 --> 02:10:23.138]  And then, about a week and a half ago, the big national news, WorldNetDaily covered it, Drudge covered it, Infowars covered it, Phyllis Schlafly, if you just joined us, there was an attempted coup inside her organization.
[02:10:24.179 --> 02:10:25.479]  Here's the headline from Dr. Corsi.
[02:10:26.239 --> 02:10:33.280]  An attempted coup to fire her and to basically change the direction, to put the powerful organization with great grassroots conservatives behind Ted Cruz.
[02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:36.301]  Phyllis Schlafly, my board plotted to fire me over Trump.
[02:10:37.182 --> 02:10:43.168]  Now, I've talked to high-level people in the Trump campaign who talked directly to people high-level in the Cruz campaign.
[02:10:43.188 --> 02:10:49.295]  They confirmed that that was directed, according to them, and everything I've been told by Stone, who's on tomorrow, by the way.
[02:10:49.315 --> 02:10:50.296]  He moved from today to tomorrow.
[02:10:50.336 --> 02:10:56.923]  Roger Stone has turned out to be deadly accurate that that was directed by the people in the Cruz camp high up.
[02:10:57.423 --> 02:10:59.405]  And it just shows you, if they think your vote doesn't count,
[02:11:00.404 --> 02:11:03.125]  Well, now maybe Phyllis Schlafly's organization doesn't count.
[02:11:03.765 --> 02:11:07.807]  And so reportedly, operatives connected to him came in and did this.
[02:11:07.827 --> 02:11:13.109]  We're going to get directly from Phyllis Schlafly, who doesn't pull any punches, but she also doesn't like to stir up trouble.
[02:11:13.129 --> 02:11:17.591]  But this isn't stirring up trouble to get to the bottom of what's happening here and hopefully have an investigation.
[02:11:17.611 --> 02:11:20.712]  I know she's learned probably more since she put out her video a few days ago.
[02:11:22.073 --> 02:11:24.214]  Mrs. Schlafly, thank you so much for coming on with us today.
[02:11:25.356 --> 02:11:26.337]  Well, thank you.
[02:11:26.797 --> 02:11:31.461]  I'm very happy to join you and happy to have a chance to tell you what's going on.
[02:11:31.901 --> 02:11:46.012]  There just seem to be a couple of people in my organization who think they can run Eagle Forum better than I can, but we've built, I think, the most unique and successful organization in the conservative movement.
[02:11:46.692 --> 02:11:48.934]  And most of them are volunteers.
[02:11:48.954 --> 02:11:49.995]  I'm a volunteer.
[02:11:50.075 --> 02:11:52.877]  All my state presidents are volunteers.
[02:11:53.644 --> 02:12:06.690]  And we have a very small paid staff, but we have built an organization that candidates for office all seek our endorsement.
[02:12:07.411 --> 02:12:10.852]  And they like to have our endorsement because they know it's meaningful.
[02:12:11.893 --> 02:12:18.816]  We have taught people that politics is where the action is, and we want them to be active in politics.
[02:12:19.733 --> 02:12:20.274]  Absolutely.
[02:12:20.374 --> 02:12:22.455]  Normally, phones aren't clear.
[02:12:22.535 --> 02:12:23.536]  Yours is very clear.
[02:12:23.576 --> 02:12:24.797]  It's a bit overdriven, ma'am.
[02:12:24.877 --> 02:12:27.079]  If you can just back off your receiver a tiny bit.
[02:12:27.579 --> 02:12:29.281]  But we did hear pretty much what you said.
[02:12:29.341 --> 02:12:33.024]  Please continue with, as best you know now, what happened.
[02:12:33.044 --> 02:12:42.331]  Because I think what happened to this important patriotic organization, what they attempted to do, the import of it goes to the character of someone who wants to be president.
[02:12:43.292 --> 02:12:49.117]  So can you break down specifically what happened in the attempted, what some have called, mugging of Eagle Forum?
[02:12:50.509 --> 02:12:59.274]  Well, the attempt is to use my endorsement of Donald Trump.
[02:12:59.534 --> 02:13:00.574]  You know, he came to St.
[02:13:00.634 --> 02:13:03.796]  Louis, had a big rally, and I introduced him.
[02:13:03.816 --> 02:13:11.880]  And I met him with him before he went on stage and asked him to support the Republican platform.
[02:13:12.340 --> 02:13:15.062]  And he promised to support the Republican platform.
[02:13:15.522 --> 02:13:16.602]  And that's important to me.
[02:13:16.662 --> 02:13:18.243]  I've had a big hand in writing it.
[02:13:18.683 --> 02:13:19.504]  It's pro-life.
[02:13:20.223 --> 02:13:26.829]  It's pro-marriage, it's pro-national sovereignty, which is very important to me.
[02:13:27.289 --> 02:13:32.234]  Military is not strong enough to have a good military.
[02:13:32.514 --> 02:13:33.815]  We've got to be superior.
[02:13:34.376 --> 02:13:40.301]  And then our enemies will respect us and our friends will rely on us.
[02:13:42.153 --> 02:13:44.154]  And anyway, he did, and so I endorsed him.
[02:13:44.514 --> 02:13:51.596]  And my guess is about half of our people are for Cruz, and about half of them are for Trump.
[02:13:52.376 --> 02:13:56.457]  And I didn't object to the one who endorsed Cruz.
[02:13:56.557 --> 02:14:00.978]  I said, you've got free speech, you can endorse anybody you want.
[02:14:04.309 --> 02:14:06.571]  Well, I mean, I interview you every few months.
[02:14:06.871 --> 02:14:10.895]  You make really salient, central points that other pundits aren't even making.
[02:14:10.915 --> 02:14:12.056]  You're obviously super sharp.
[02:14:12.457 --> 02:14:13.057]  My grandmother's 90s.
[02:14:13.077 --> 02:14:14.239]  She's super sharp.
[02:14:14.539 --> 02:14:16.200]  Has a lot of wisdom that I don't have as well.
[02:14:16.821 --> 02:14:23.728]  It's just so insulting to try to, in the dead of night, you know, steal the organization from you and just claim it's because you supported Donald Trump.
[02:14:23.768 --> 02:14:24.448]  It really shows
[02:14:25.089 --> 02:14:30.172]  Well, I think they must have been, because all of this fight started when somebody came to me and gave me a list
[02:14:49.904 --> 02:14:56.989]  Of about a dozen EGLE leaders, EGLE members, who were endorsing Cruz.
[02:14:57.829 --> 02:15:02.973]  And they did it in a way that made it look like it was EGLE Forum doing it.
[02:15:03.413 --> 02:15:06.215]  But nevertheless, I decided not to say anything.
[02:15:07.136 --> 02:15:09.437]  Let them do it.
[02:15:09.777 --> 02:15:10.278]  Okay.
[02:15:10.758 --> 02:15:16.362]  Unfortunately, following that, one of them made a robocall on behalf of Cruz.
[02:15:19.302 --> 02:15:21.864]  A number of them have been using it.
[02:15:22.084 --> 02:15:28.847]  I suspect that they've been letting the Clues campaign use some of my list, which they have leaked to them.
[02:15:30.348 --> 02:15:31.649]  Wow, that's bombshell.
[02:15:31.689 --> 02:15:34.370]  I hadn't heard that yet directly from Phyllis Schlafly right now.
[02:15:34.850 --> 02:15:35.671]  She's researching it.
[02:15:35.711 --> 02:15:37.051]  Looks like they had a list.
[02:15:37.432 --> 02:15:38.792]  She got calls from other members.
[02:15:39.032 --> 02:15:42.354]  Yeah, and of course, the other thing they've done is to divide up my family.
[02:15:44.035 --> 02:15:48.017]  My daughter is with the group that is leading me.
[02:15:48.710 --> 02:15:50.032]  I don't know.
[02:16:06.947 --> 02:16:09.489]  He always errs on the safe side of things.
[02:16:09.729 --> 02:16:11.089]  Well, Phyllis, that's amazing.
[02:16:11.129 --> 02:16:19.493]  I mean, not just getting rid of you, claiming you were old, but now your son, a long-term member, lawyer and accountant involved in an organization that's been so selfish.
[02:16:19.513 --> 02:16:22.134]  And then we've got another son they want to get rid of.
[02:16:22.515 --> 02:16:30.138]  And he's the one who's written a lot of these amicus briefs that we've filed with the Supreme Court in important cases.
[02:16:30.718 --> 02:16:34.400]  And we have a very wonderful collection of these briefs.
[02:16:35.029 --> 02:16:38.291]  And you'll be interested in one of those briefs we filed.
[02:16:38.351 --> 02:16:39.832]  I don't remember which one it was.
[02:16:39.852 --> 02:16:45.216]  The ACLU filed a brief asking the court not to read Eagle Farm's brief.
[02:16:45.636 --> 02:16:46.476]  I remember that.
[02:16:47.037 --> 02:16:48.458]  Fellas, getting back to the list.
[02:16:48.498 --> 02:16:49.318]  This is amazing.
[02:16:49.979 --> 02:16:52.800]  So people are getting robocalls.
[02:16:53.281 --> 02:17:01.426]  Somehow they did get access to some of my lists and I don't think that was very nice.
[02:17:02.455 --> 02:17:18.888]  So you took the high road, let high-level members of the Eagle Forum go out and basically ignore what your main endorsement and just in your face endorse Cruz as they were the Eagle Forum misrepresenting, and then suddenly Robo calls as if Cruz, I guess, had already thought he was running Eagle Forum.
[02:17:19.668 --> 02:17:24.952]  Are you going to formally ask them to return any list or stop using your name?
[02:17:27.594 --> 02:17:32.258]  Well, I'm trying to say that these other people are not representing Eagle Forum.
[02:17:33.896 --> 02:17:39.900]  I represent Eagle Farm, and they tried to throw me out, but at any rate, I'm still here.
[02:17:40.741 --> 02:17:41.862]  And I intend to be here.
[02:17:42.943 --> 02:17:56.693]  I was reading Dr. Corsi, who I know has spoken to you at WorldNetDaily about kind of the chain of events, but specifically, break down for us, ma'am, if you can, and we're going to go to break, come back in five more minutes to finish up about the general election with you and your book being republished.
[02:17:58.382 --> 02:18:05.590]  Well, if anybody wants to know why I endorsed Trump, you've got to read the book A Choice, Not an Echo.
[02:18:06.111 --> 02:18:08.693]  Because I have been fighting the Kingmakers.
[02:18:09.314 --> 02:18:20.947]  The Kingmakers are a lot of rich people who think they are appointed to designate who the Republican nominees are and who should be the President of the United States.
[02:18:21.408 --> 02:18:22.489]  And I don't think so.
[02:18:22.710 --> 02:18:26.053]  I think the grassroots are entitled to vote for the candidate.
[02:18:26.093 --> 02:18:29.237]  That's what you've said on my show for 21 years, is what you've been saying for 50 years.
[02:18:29.597 --> 02:18:32.961]  That's what you stand for, is conservative populism.
[02:18:34.783 --> 02:18:35.544]  That's correct.
[02:18:36.224 --> 02:18:39.308]  And the kingmakers have had their way.
[02:18:39.810 --> 02:19:07.599]  You know, I tell people, I've been to every Republican convention since 1952, and I was there when the late, great Senator Ervin Dirksen, one of our greatest Republican speakers, said on the floor of the convention, I've forgotten which one it was, talking about the Kingmakers then, we followed you before and you led us down the road to defeat.
[02:19:08.516 --> 02:19:17.478]  Well, the Kingmakers really don't care whether the Republicans or Democrats win, just so they're people they can pay off and control.
[02:19:18.658 --> 02:19:29.340]  And we're seeing that arrogance now, where even the Republican establishment, Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, say, fine, we'll take Hillary over Donald Trump, because they just want to maintain power.
[02:19:30.560 --> 02:19:32.100]  Yes, that is correct.
[02:19:32.660 --> 02:19:37.001]  And I want the grassroots to win, and I think we've got a chance with Trump.
[02:19:38.168 --> 02:19:39.428]  That's why they're scared to death of it.
[02:19:39.448 --> 02:20:05.956]  Man, we're going to go to break and come back and I want to talk more about the election with you, the book being republished, A Choice on an Echo, but just briefly when we return, though, the specifics, because I was reading the news about them trying to get your bank account, the companies, you know, the organization, the tax-free group, and they were trying to take over and fail, which shows how fraudulent it was, thank God, and it just goes to the whole attitude of Ted Cruz and his henchmen trying to shark in and take over.
[02:20:06.896 --> 02:20:10.280]  Uh, this organization, truly sickening.
[02:20:20.492 --> 02:20:24.557]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[02:20:25.137 --> 02:20:27.140]  It was a rare and precious pearl.
[02:20:29.329 --> 02:20:36.452]  Conceived in faith and liberty, home of the brave, land of the free, it was the envy of the world.
[02:20:37.953 --> 02:20:48.277]  But this shining city on the hill has turned from the Creator's will and let evil take control.
[02:20:48.357 --> 02:20:55.260]  Now the reckless men who lead them want to strip away their freedom and to steal their very soul.
[02:20:57.828 --> 02:21:00.250]  Now it's smoke and mirrors, switch and bait.
[02:21:00.710 --> 02:21:04.752]  Criticize and confiscate and let the guilty walk away.
[02:21:04.832 --> 02:21:07.074]  What difference at this point does it make?
[02:21:07.154 --> 02:21:14.198]  In this once righteous, godly nation, in the halls of education, they prevent a child to pray.
[02:21:14.318 --> 02:21:16.920]  Our society is moving towards marxism.
[02:21:16.960 --> 02:21:23.424]  They say we need to spread the wealth, and they pretend to guard the health of the feeble and the poor.
[02:21:23.444 --> 02:21:24.845]  You can keep the doctrine.
[02:21:25.905 --> 02:21:32.930]  While the hand they hold behind their back confuses and conceals the fact that the truth is at the door.
[02:21:32.990 --> 02:21:39.094]  There's an unseen hand that pulls strings.
[02:21:40.655 --> 02:21:44.858]  It makes his little puppets dance to every song he sings.
[02:21:44.958 --> 02:21:50.162]  It's a nightfall then on a rising tide.
[02:21:50.182 --> 02:21:51.583]  Look beyond the shadows
[02:21:53.379 --> 02:21:55.740]  Behold a painful horse ride.
[02:21:56.020 --> 02:21:57.781]  Something's wrong.
[02:21:58.301 --> 02:21:59.021]  We all know.
[02:21:59.141 --> 02:22:01.862]  They claim to seek a new world order.
[02:22:01.942 --> 02:22:03.503]  Nations without borders.
[02:22:04.403 --> 02:22:07.864]  But don't believe their lies.
[02:22:07.964 --> 02:22:14.967]  Even in this wealthy nation, it can come down to starvation in the twinkling of an eye.
[02:22:18.020 --> 02:22:20.181]  They tell us there will soon be peace.
[02:22:20.281 --> 02:22:22.602]  Our lives will be an endless scheme.
[02:22:22.902 --> 02:22:24.742]  But they lead us toward the dark.
[02:22:26.003 --> 02:22:29.224]  In the distance, sabers rattle.
[02:22:29.664 --> 02:22:31.424]  And the army's trained for battle.
[02:22:31.924 --> 02:22:36.186]  As the beast prepares his mark.
[02:22:36.206 --> 02:22:38.366]  There's an unseen hand.
[02:22:38.606 --> 02:22:40.227]  That pulls the string.
[02:22:40.607 --> 02:22:43.828]  And makes his little puppets dance.
[02:22:43.888 --> 02:22:45.448]  To any song he sings.
[02:22:45.468 --> 02:22:46.409]  As the night falls in.
[02:22:52.456 --> 02:23:00.708]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces.
[02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:04.513]  The dark side bent on global governance.

[02:24:20.641 --> 02:24:23.704]  Sean Hannity blew up at him yesterday and said, stop saying you're winning elections.
[02:24:23.944 --> 02:24:24.784]  You're canceling them.
[02:24:26.485 --> 02:24:27.226]  That's a big deal.
[02:24:29.841 --> 02:24:37.365]  Phyllis Schlafly, the biggest conservative patriot icon living out there, who's been around the longest fighting.
[02:24:37.746 --> 02:24:40.007]  We just had some very interesting discussions in that break.
[02:24:40.627 --> 02:24:53.755]  Ma'am, if you can recap the case against Cruz, obviously the robocalls from having your list, the pressure that you were put under to go along with this, the attempted coup, and then now, where you see all this going, Phyllis?
[02:24:55.131 --> 02:25:12.258]  Well it must be that somebody who betrayed me among our old people gave some of the list to Cruz because I found that the Cruz people were calling some of our eagles and trying to line them up for Cruz.
[02:25:12.938 --> 02:25:17.079]  Well I did not authorize that and that's not on my plan at all.
[02:25:17.099 --> 02:25:23.742]  I think Trump is the best bet because he's the one who would
[02:25:24.238 --> 02:25:26.479]  I really think the Kingmakers are where it hurts.
[02:25:27.239 --> 02:25:32.801]  And if you read Choice.net, you'll know why I think they're the biggest threat to our country.
[02:25:33.421 --> 02:25:41.163]  And they need to be taken out of control and not allowed to run our country.
[02:25:42.363 --> 02:25:50.926]  The people who seem to try to be taking over have a lot of talent, but it's not enough to be able to run a good
[02:25:51.622 --> 02:25:52.022]  I don't
[02:26:21.789 --> 02:26:24.570]  But she knew nothing about running an organization.
[02:26:25.230 --> 02:26:30.271]  And she knew nothing about politics out of her, outside of her own domain.
[02:26:31.051 --> 02:26:35.612]  And I think you gotta love politics, which is what I do.
[02:26:35.952 --> 02:26:46.274]  So to be clear, you were already moving your daughter Anne out of the succession to run the organization, and then she got mad and tried to coup?
[02:26:46.374 --> 02:26:47.414]  Is that what happened?
[02:26:48.554 --> 02:26:50.935]  That's pretty much what happened, yes.
[02:26:51.809 --> 02:26:58.393]  And she lined up with some of the people who thought they could get good jobs with Eagle 4, but they got rid of me.
[02:26:58.413 --> 02:27:01.956]  Have you talked to Anne since this happened?
[02:27:04.077 --> 02:27:09.081]  I've talked to her a few times, and she's trying to tell me she's just doing this for my benefit.
[02:27:09.861 --> 02:27:12.583]  But I don't need somebody to do something for my benefit.
[02:27:13.103 --> 02:27:15.545]  I've gotten along quite well all these years.
[02:27:17.199 --> 02:27:20.880]  Yeah, folks always try to take something away from somebody they didn't build for their benefit, Phyllis.
[02:27:20.900 --> 02:27:22.340]  Isn't that the way Bernie operates?
[02:27:23.521 --> 02:27:24.901]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:27:25.381 --> 02:27:33.243]  But I've just got an awful lot of loyal people who know that I've been faithful to them, and I think they will be faithful to me.
[02:27:33.263 --> 02:27:37.265]  Well, ma'am, how could you not be for Trump, even though he has some issues?
[02:27:37.325 --> 02:27:45.747]  And how could I not be when the Communist Chinese, the biggest murderers in history, threaten us and say we can't have him, and the Mexican presidents and the Socialist Pope
[02:27:46.147 --> 02:27:51.910]  And all the communists and every other special interest and the big multinationals and Goldman Sachs.
[02:27:52.430 --> 02:27:54.371]  You know a man or a woman by their enemies.
[02:27:55.131 --> 02:27:56.292]  And Donald Trump's got them.
[02:27:56.312 --> 02:28:02.175]  I don't know if you know, but I started out in my active life fighting the communists.
[02:28:02.295 --> 02:28:08.818]  I mean, there were years when the communist threat and the Soviet Union was the biggest danger to our country.
[02:28:08.878 --> 02:28:09.739]  No, I know you did, ma'am.
[02:28:11.345 --> 02:28:18.109]  So, we all knew that when Reagan said it was the evil empire, we knew he knew what he was talking about.
[02:28:18.890 --> 02:28:21.051]  Do you think Donald Trump could be as great as Reagan?
[02:28:23.533 --> 02:28:27.195]  Well, I'll tell you, there were a lot of problems with Reagan when we backed him.
[02:28:27.655 --> 02:28:35.200]  I'll tell you, the big issue was in 1980, and that's an interesting story of what went on behind the headlines.
[02:28:35.660 --> 02:28:38.662]  I urge you to get my new edition of A Choice Down an Echo,
[02:28:39.232 --> 02:28:45.154]  Which tells you the shenanigans they tried to pull in order to outbox Reagan in 1980.
[02:28:45.414 --> 02:28:46.195]  Well, I agree.
[02:28:46.215 --> 02:28:49.076]  I agree that they're going to try the shenanigans they did in 1980 again.
[02:28:49.096 --> 02:28:50.236]  I don't think they're going to get away with it.
[02:28:50.276 --> 02:28:54.938]  But in closing, Pat Buchanan has said, even if we get Trump, the West is done.
[02:28:54.978 --> 02:28:55.819]  The West is doomed.
[02:28:56.539 --> 02:28:57.819]  I don't really agree with Pat on that.
[02:28:58.180 --> 02:28:59.080]  No, no, no.
[02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:01.561]  I don't accept that everything's lost.
[02:29:02.701 --> 02:29:04.162]  Where there's life, there's hope.
[02:29:06.090 --> 02:29:07.791]  All right, we've got 45 seconds left.
[02:29:07.851 --> 02:29:09.272]  Closing comment, Phyllis Schlafly.
[02:29:09.292 --> 02:29:11.994]  I want to say congratulations for surviving the mugging, the coup.
[02:29:12.614 --> 02:29:14.435]  What else do you have to say about Ted Cruz in closing?
[02:29:16.436 --> 02:29:23.420]  Well, I don't think he's the right one for president because I really don't think he can do the things that need to be done.
[02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:30.464]  I think Trump isn't perfect, but I'll tell you, Reagan was not perfect when we elected him in 1980.
[02:29:31.895 --> 02:29:37.537]  And he grew to adopt the full conservative agenda later on.
[02:29:38.197 --> 02:29:43.379]  But we made the right choice and he became the greatest president of the 20th century.
[02:29:43.519 --> 02:29:44.140]  Phyllis?
[02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:48.101]  But I think Trump can grow into that.
[02:29:48.341 --> 02:29:50.322]  Alright, Phyllis Schlafly, let me say bye to you during the break.
[02:29:50.382 --> 02:29:51.082]  Thank you so much.
[02:29:51.762 --> 02:29:52.903]  What an amazing lady, folks.
[02:29:52.923 --> 02:29:53.643]  She really is a great lady.
[02:29:53.683 --> 02:29:54.223]  I read her books.
[02:29:54.603 --> 02:29:55.424]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:29:55.444 --> 02:29:55.804]  Stay with us.
[02:29:59.927 --> 02:30:02.909]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.850 --> 02:30:06.532]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.865 --> 02:30:19.890]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:30:19.950 --> 02:30:28.174]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:30:28.354 --> 02:30:33.017]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:30:33.237 --> 02:30:39.942]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:30:40.022 --> 02:30:47.107]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:30:47.207 --> 02:30:54.072]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:30:54.232 --> 02:30:58.575]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:30:58.695 --> 02:31:01.917]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:31:02.077 --> 02:31:08.201]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great-tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:31:08.381 --> 02:31:10.582]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:10.702 --> 02:31:14.024]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:31:14.164 --> 02:31:16.426]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:31:16.606 --> 02:31:24.871]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:31:25.231 --> 02:31:28.573]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[02:31:28.734 --> 02:31:46.626]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula, sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:31:46.846 --> 02:31:48.747]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[02:31:49.087 --> 02:31:56.729]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:31:57.029 --> 02:32:03.191]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:32:03.512 --> 02:32:10.434]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Male Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:32:10.814 --> 02:32:12.216]  My name is Alex Jones.
[02:32:12.716 --> 02:32:18.662]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:32:18.883 --> 02:32:33.057]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running 6 miles every other day, swimming 2-3 miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights
[02:32:33.638 --> 02:32:35.558]  We're focusing on fighting the globalists.
[02:32:35.958 --> 02:32:43.760]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds and the weight's going off even faster.
[02:32:43.980 --> 02:32:51.082]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[02:32:51.402 --> 02:32:57.123]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[02:32:57.243 --> 02:33:03.424]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.

[02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.750]  Big Brother.
[02:33:25.351 --> 02:33:26.551]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:27.151 --> 02:33:28.252]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:29.032 --> 02:33:30.453]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:30.753 --> 02:33:31.913]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:31.953 --> 02:33:36.935]  Live, from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:36.955 --> 02:33:44.218]  It's close to midnight, and something evil's lurking from the door.
[02:33:44.278 --> 02:33:49.920]  Inside the moonlight, it's clear sight that almost stopped your heart.
[02:33:49.960 --> 02:33:52.862]  You try to scream, but
[02:33:56.781 --> 02:33:58.283]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:33:58.303 --> 02:33:58.843]  to 3 p.m.
[02:33:58.863 --> 02:33:59.524]  Central, we're here.
[02:34:00.645 --> 02:34:01.506]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:34:02.387 --> 02:34:08.873]  I host the first three hours, then we have one of the great crew members, anchors, come on and host the fourth.
[02:34:08.893 --> 02:34:12.416]  A lot of times I co-host, segue right into that fourth hour as well.
[02:34:12.957 --> 02:34:16.600]  Today it's David Knight who does it a lot of the time, at least twice a week, does a wonderful job.
[02:34:17.932 --> 02:34:19.613]  Paul Watson yesterday from London, England.
[02:34:20.214 --> 02:34:24.057]  As Cruz fades, it's Hillary or Bus for the New World Order.
[02:34:24.077 --> 02:34:25.598]  That's what he's going to be covering next hour.
[02:34:25.958 --> 02:34:29.681]  Central Bank's revenge as Andrew Jackson is removed from the $20 bill.
[02:34:29.841 --> 02:34:30.682]  I'm going to cover this too.
[02:34:31.643 --> 02:34:36.406]  We look at his war against the foreign megabanks of his day.
[02:34:36.907 --> 02:34:38.788]  The Taiwan brawl of cakes.
[02:34:40.349 --> 02:34:41.971]  Or the Tijuana brawl of cakes.
[02:34:42.131 --> 02:34:45.193]  Gay pastor busted for cake fake to make himself a victim.
[02:34:45.213 --> 02:34:45.774]  Yeah, it turns out
[02:34:46.769 --> 02:34:53.412]  Whole Foods had the video surveillance of him getting the cake that said one thing and then ended up having fag put on it.
[02:34:56.994 --> 02:34:57.514]  Every day.
[02:35:00.535 --> 02:35:01.036]  Every day.
[02:35:05.117 --> 02:35:06.818]  I see articles about false flags.
[02:35:08.219 --> 02:35:09.379]  Or in this case, false fags.
[02:35:10.940 --> 02:35:11.460]  Pun intended.
[02:35:12.421 --> 02:35:12.781]  By the way,
[02:35:15.717 --> 02:35:31.510]  I'm not somebody that likes to use pejorative words that are hurtful to people, but when people begin to try to take over all language and say, mother, father, he, she, or saying, hey, she's a nice lady, or anything, it's bad.
[02:35:32.531 --> 02:35:33.172]  It's brainwashing.
[02:35:33.912 --> 02:35:39.137]  Remember what happened with so many cases, but with Jerry Seinfeld.
[02:35:41.547 --> 02:35:45.189]  And his 13-year-old daughter, he said, we're going to move back to New York from the countryside so you can meet more boys.
[02:35:46.010 --> 02:35:48.131]  And she said, saying boys and girls is sexist.
[02:35:48.231 --> 02:35:50.592]  And he thought, oh, my daughter's just ignorant.
[02:35:51.152 --> 02:35:55.995]  No, Seinfeld, that's the brainwashing, where actual words in mass are banned.
[02:35:56.735 --> 02:36:03.059]  And the only way you are a hero is you go and you're abused by someone.
[02:36:04.180 --> 02:36:07.602]  And every day there is a
[02:36:09.206 --> 02:36:21.163]  A Muslim woman, or a Muslim man, or a black lady, or a Hispanic man, or on and on and on, who put a swastika on their dorm room, or burn a cross in their yard, or say somebody stabbed them.
[02:36:23.078 --> 02:36:28.461]  Or carved N-words on their faces, and sometimes white people do it too.
[02:36:29.382 --> 02:36:31.964]  Oh, three black guys jumped me into this, and I see that in the news too.
[02:36:32.284 --> 02:36:39.729]  The point is, that's why a lot of times in criminology, the cops, if somebody is the first one on the scene of a burned down house, they ask, well, what were you doing?
[02:36:39.869 --> 02:36:43.651]  Or a lot of times there's this criminology, most firefighters are the best people in the world.
[02:36:44.492 --> 02:36:47.754]  But there are some people that are pyromaniacs, so they become firefighters.
[02:36:48.473 --> 02:36:50.474]  It's like some people are pedophiles so they become schoolteachers.
[02:36:50.794 --> 02:36:52.614]  Doesn't mean schoolteachers on average are pedophiles.
[02:36:53.234 --> 02:36:59.276]  It's just that there is a smaller number of them that are, but not compared to the general public.
[02:36:59.296 --> 02:36:59.956]  There's a larger number.
[02:37:02.377 --> 02:37:03.598]  And now, hate crime hoax.
[02:37:03.638 --> 02:37:08.139]  Black student admits she was behind the threat to kill all blacks at Kean University.
[02:37:10.762 --> 02:37:19.070]  Well yeah, we can go in, and we've done reports on this years ago, I'll shoot some more, and we can look how it's the same IP address, posing as a racist black person and as a racist white person.
[02:37:19.110 --> 02:37:23.074]  Now we don't know whether they're white or black or it's a bot doing it, but it goes on.
[02:37:24.815 --> 02:37:26.557]  To change the discussion, to take it over.
[02:37:28.038 --> 02:37:29.620]  There's another one, that was just last week.
[02:37:29.760 --> 02:37:34.765]  Fake hate crime, woman admits she lied about white man slashing her.
[02:37:36.084 --> 02:37:37.064]  Calling her a terrorist.
[02:37:37.624 --> 02:37:40.545]  Yeah, the Muslim woman did the added goody that was a white guy on top of it.
[02:37:40.565 --> 02:37:46.266]  That's why radical Islam really merges nicely with the left, you know, it's whole persecution complex.
[02:37:51.427 --> 02:38:02.990]  So the reason I digress off into that is just reading what he says he's going to be covering coming up, David Knight, in the fourth hour, but it's a business now
[02:38:04.824 --> 02:38:14.028]  To go into a barber shop that's for men, where they don't curl hair and they don't color hair, they trim beards and mustaches and cut men's hair.
[02:38:14.408 --> 02:38:18.310]  It'd be like if I went into a bikini waxing facility for women and said, wax my bikini.
[02:38:18.850 --> 02:38:19.670]  They would refuse me.
[02:38:20.290 --> 02:38:21.731]  Now, would I then sue them?
[02:38:22.211 --> 02:38:23.572]  Do they hate me because I'm a man?
[02:38:23.732 --> 02:38:23.932]  No.
[02:38:24.552 --> 02:38:28.654]  They tailor businesses towards men or towards women.
[02:38:31.550 --> 02:38:36.512]  And they're just taking it a step further with the lawyers saying, no, you're doing that because you're hateful.
[02:38:36.832 --> 02:38:40.973]  And this is a way to create internal strife and internal warfare in this country.
[02:38:44.074 --> 02:38:57.819]  It'd be like a woman going to a doctor who is for men and their sexual organs, going to a doctor that specializes in that and saying, doctor, I want you to remove my testicles, say, hypothetically.
[02:38:58.079 --> 02:38:59.460]  The doctor says, you don't have any.
[02:39:00.376 --> 02:39:01.316]  I'm not going to treat you.
[02:39:02.617 --> 02:39:07.458]  Then you sue them, this has actually happened before, because they wouldn't do the surgery.
[02:39:07.598 --> 02:39:17.040]  This is mental illness being given an entrance, an entree, into life to sabotage us.
[02:39:17.900 --> 02:39:24.742]  That's why the CIA declassified, Congress said a few years ago, what we already knew, that DeviantArt was being financed by the government.
[02:39:25.082 --> 02:39:26.222]  You want to have DeviantArt?
[02:39:27.042 --> 02:39:27.723]  That's your business.
[02:39:27.823 --> 02:39:28.763]  Don't make me pay for it.
[02:39:29.605 --> 02:39:36.008]  And they did it, they said, to confuse people for the next level of moral destruction.
[02:39:36.588 --> 02:39:37.348]  And let me just be clear.
[02:39:41.970 --> 02:39:49.613]  I'm not up here as some guy that sees a woman in a miniskirt and blushes, because I'm such a moral guy.
[02:39:49.633 --> 02:39:52.254]  I go to church three times a week and I have never committed a sin.
[02:39:52.434 --> 02:39:53.134]  I'm really good.
[02:39:53.515 --> 02:39:54.235]  I'm perfect.
[02:39:58.236 --> 02:39:59.057]  As you grow older,
[02:40:00.555 --> 02:40:05.697]  Your palate widens, your tastes change, you get more, quote, sophisticated.
[02:40:08.078 --> 02:40:09.778]  I'm not up here judging anybody.
[02:40:10.899 --> 02:40:21.183]  But I'll tell you, as I get even older, I become more conservative and dial back my thoughts, my actions, things like that.
[02:40:21.223 --> 02:40:22.623]  But I'm not up here judging anybody.
[02:40:23.363 --> 02:40:27.385]  But they shell modern liberalism as it's just a bunch of sex and drugs and partying.
[02:40:29.906 --> 02:40:33.688]  When liberalism is more freedom, lower taxes, and a more open society.
[02:40:34.348 --> 02:40:38.930]  The system doesn't care if you have a bunch of abortions and die of a drug overdose on drugs they shipped in.
[02:40:39.210 --> 02:40:52.575]  They want you to think that's your really cool, sexy liberty, is to, you know, just tell the most vile, bizarre, you know, comedic stories you can, and everyone bows down to it because it's the most over-the-top thing they've ever seen.
[02:40:55.336 --> 02:40:57.157]  They're replacing high culture
[02:40:58.618 --> 02:41:03.963]  And high art, and putting in its place the most ugly, to sabotage society.
[02:41:04.423 --> 02:41:21.859]  And there are, again, declassified and even mainstream news articles admitting, in Soviet countries and in our country in the 60s and 70s and 80s, they went for a move, even when buildings were more expensive, to make them ugly, squat, soulless, to oppress the soul.
[02:41:23.430 --> 02:41:36.301]  So that you would accept not aiming high so the elites on their own corporate and governmental reservations could enjoy the beautiful and raise themselves to a higher level.
[02:41:37.342 --> 02:41:38.263]  There's a London Independent.
[02:41:38.383 --> 02:41:39.884]  Modern art was a CIA weapon.
[02:41:45.589 --> 02:41:50.674]  So that's what I'm getting at here when I talk about this.
[02:41:51.861 --> 02:42:02.564]  And they're also at war with women, with men, with the human condition, with the human species.
[02:42:02.865 --> 02:42:05.325]  The globalists operate, as I've said, like they're space aliens.
[02:42:05.405 --> 02:42:06.226]  I'm not saying they are.
[02:42:06.646 --> 02:42:10.047]  But they are ending our genetic future.
[02:42:10.127 --> 02:42:14.748]  They are twisting and mutilating our actual genetics, not just beginning to reduce our populations.
[02:42:15.228 --> 02:42:20.030]  They are targeting the most intelligent for soft kill.
[02:42:22.125 --> 02:42:23.406]  They are sabotaging us.
[02:42:27.089 --> 02:42:28.490]  And they know what they're doing.
[02:42:30.552 --> 02:42:34.114]  But if you're conscious of their operation, it's game over.
[02:42:35.415 --> 02:42:48.806]  If you're conscious that when you do something decadent, or do something destructive, that it's part of the human condition, and that they've set things up to try to make you only live in that world, then you're in control of the paradigm yourself.
[02:42:49.997 --> 02:42:53.082]  And your mind knows how to deal with it and basically get you out of it.
[02:42:54.324 --> 02:43:02.517]  But instead, they sell being in the gutter as the most beautiful, wonderful thing in the world and like it's some great accomplishment that you've had.
[02:43:07.130 --> 02:43:08.011]  So just be aware of that.
[02:43:08.311 --> 02:43:09.311]  They want you to fail.
[02:43:09.351 --> 02:43:10.412]  They want you to be miserable.
[02:43:10.452 --> 02:43:11.473]  They want you to be unhappy.
[02:43:11.513 --> 02:43:12.674]  They want you out of the way.
[02:43:12.774 --> 02:43:13.954]  They want to steal the future.
[02:43:14.275 --> 02:43:15.555]  They want to control the future.
[02:43:15.676 --> 02:43:17.517]  And they admit they're doing that.
[02:43:17.977 --> 02:43:27.984]  In fact, can we queue up the three-minute video I never got to yesterday that's kind of a compilation of some of the social justice warriors we've videotaped on the road in the last month, the crew has, just acting like total freaks.
[02:43:28.384 --> 02:43:29.645]  This is even the worst stuff out there.
[02:43:30.405 --> 02:43:47.711]  These are dumbed down, unhealthy, angry people that want to shut free speech down and this is what the universities have paid to create and paid to put out with the faculty attacking students' free speech and muscling people and attacking people.
[02:43:48.011 --> 02:43:49.672]  This isn't something aberrant.
[02:43:52.093 --> 02:43:58.915]  It's a bunch of people that watch Madison Avenue TV with the Kardashians who feel ugly, who feel inadequate,
[02:44:00.256 --> 02:44:01.497]  And who want an identity.
[02:44:02.277 --> 02:44:11.263]  Not an identity of renaissance or freedom, but, I'm a tranny, is what the guy says, and I'm gonna spit in your face, even though you're being nice to me.
[02:44:11.724 --> 02:44:12.464]  Because you hate me.
[02:44:12.965 --> 02:44:14.626]  Even though the people don't hate you.
[02:44:14.966 --> 02:44:17.668]  The identity is not just that you're a man who identifies as a woman.
[02:44:17.708 --> 02:44:18.648]  I'm not attacking you for that.
[02:44:19.469 --> 02:44:28.255]  It's that you're out there following a template to shut down free speech, spitting in people's faces and our crew's faces, and stomping around angry.
[02:44:29.577 --> 02:44:44.202]  On a power trip and you're following a program of bullying put into you as you get Yale professors fired because they put out an email because they were over the program saying people are allowed free speech and they're allowed to have costume parties.
[02:44:45.622 --> 02:44:49.884]  And so they scream and yell, oh no, I'm scared while they bully him.
[02:44:50.899 --> 02:44:55.463]  They see InfoWars shirts, they scream, InfoWars, I'm scared, I'm hurt, get me a psychologist!
[02:44:55.824 --> 02:45:01.128]  So they claim they have a beef against your speech, that your speech hurt them, so it's gone.
[02:45:01.449 --> 02:45:03.370]  This is the essence of domination.
[02:45:03.751 --> 02:45:05.572]  The essence of them conquering us.
[02:45:08.055 --> 02:45:12.459]  Where they tell cultures and systems and families, you go die in the corner.
[02:45:14.008 --> 02:45:42.473]  And now that you're an individual going and getting a worthless college education, they want to screw you up as bad as they can, so you're so broke back, and so chip on your shoulder, and so mentally ill, that when you get out of the four-year degree, you go back and get another four-year degree, and then another three-year degree, or another two-year degree, hoping somehow you're going to get fulfilled by the pop culture and by the media, when the whole thing was designed to not fulfill you.
[02:45:44.019 --> 02:45:46.362]  The whole thing was designed to ruin you.
[02:45:47.643 --> 02:45:49.105]  The whole thing was designed to...
[02:45:52.372 --> 02:46:12.612]  Make you just desperately angry, desperately unhappy, and use the tribal programming you have for ancient survival to create new ghosts of phantom tribes, of brown bags, and words you heard, and white men must fall, and this is your time to rise, and you're going to have something.
[02:46:12.692 --> 02:46:14.453]  Bernie's going to give you free things.
[02:46:15.434 --> 02:46:15.915]  Hillary!
[02:46:17.998 --> 02:46:33.129]  When it's the mega-elites of the Saudi Arabians, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Communist Chinese that killed 80-plus million people, training you with all this, and then they export out of the U.S.
[02:46:33.349 --> 02:46:37.592]  all over the world to other countries this mental illness.
[02:46:39.753 --> 02:46:54.728]  Everyone just starts fighting with each other and being totally unhappy and men against women and women against men and just all of this psychological weaponized fifth-generation warfare that they admit is warfare to hurt you.
[02:46:55.429 --> 02:46:57.091]  And you can show these social justice warriors
[02:46:58.266 --> 02:47:19.177]  Alright, here's MIT, here's the Wall Street Journal, here's a paper written in the 70s adopted as policy by the Carney Endowment to break up the family and make women totally alone and hateful and then wed them to the state by age 40 to then really exacerbate their bitterness and help create change agents to accelerate the collapse of the human species.
[02:47:19.457 --> 02:47:22.759]  I mean, these are, I just basically paraphrase paragraphs we've read on air.
[02:47:23.179 --> 02:47:24.880]  I mean, I can say, here's the weapon plan
[02:47:25.640 --> 02:47:27.983]  And they'll go, I don't care, we are ugly and deserve to die!
[02:47:28.203 --> 02:47:32.409]  Humans are evil and... And the ones who get through that actually see it, they go, that's right!
[02:47:32.649 --> 02:47:33.951]  And we are gonna kill everybody!
[02:47:33.971 --> 02:47:35.072]  I wanna kill my children!
[02:47:35.252 --> 02:47:36.153]  I wanna be ugly!
[02:47:36.173 --> 02:47:39.137]  They're like, wow, you really are liberal, aren't you?
[02:47:39.337 --> 02:47:40.098]  They're all like that.
[02:47:40.319 --> 02:47:42.181]  I'm ugly and I stink and I love Satan.
[02:47:44.028 --> 02:47:45.889]  Because they just have nothing.
[02:47:46.589 --> 02:47:49.411]  And they get more and more depressed as the system doesn't fulfill them.
[02:47:49.611 --> 02:47:50.751]  They get more and more unhappy.
[02:47:50.851 --> 02:47:51.672]  Nothing delivers them.
[02:47:51.932 --> 02:47:54.533]  So they just get deeper in and go, if I just buy into the system more.
[02:47:55.073 --> 02:48:00.056]  And finally it's just devil worship and evil and nihilism and just bleh!
[02:48:00.356 --> 02:48:01.456]  But they won't kill themselves.
[02:48:01.756 --> 02:48:05.718]  They'll wallow around hating everyone that isn't in their miserable condition.
[02:48:09.520 --> 02:48:11.041]  Let's go ahead and go to some of this compilation.
[02:48:11.061 --> 02:48:11.321]  Here it is.
[02:48:15.094 --> 02:48:19.678]  Like I said, I'm going to play the compilation I gave you guys yesterday that Rob did put together, and then we're going to play that on everybody.
[02:48:19.718 --> 02:48:20.899]  No, you need to get out.
[02:48:21.219 --> 02:48:22.180]  You need to get out.
[02:48:22.260 --> 02:48:22.701]  No, I don't.
[02:48:23.722 --> 02:48:24.683]  You need to get out.
[02:48:25.183 --> 02:48:25.804]  I actually don't.
[02:48:25.944 --> 02:48:26.244]  All right.
[02:48:26.744 --> 02:48:27.605]  Hit pause.
[02:48:27.665 --> 02:48:28.066]  Hit pause.
[02:48:28.086 --> 02:48:28.326]  Back it up.
[02:48:28.346 --> 02:48:28.926]  I'm going to start over.
[02:48:28.946 --> 02:48:29.127]  Thank you.
[02:48:29.147 --> 02:48:30.107]  I'm going to start from the beginning.
[02:48:30.127 --> 02:48:30.428]  Oh, gosh.
[02:48:32.082 --> 02:48:34.364]  Again, this is about her moment to get violent.
[02:48:35.084 --> 02:48:36.045]  Her moment of power.
[02:48:36.125 --> 02:48:37.246]  She's a general now.
[02:48:37.927 --> 02:48:39.108]  See, men have been removed.
[02:48:39.448 --> 02:48:40.809]  All real culture has been removed.
[02:48:41.229 --> 02:48:42.350]  Now women are desperate.
[02:48:42.671 --> 02:48:43.391]  They don't know!
[02:48:43.892 --> 02:48:44.832]  They're not happy!
[02:48:45.213 --> 02:48:46.334]  They've got to be a general!
[02:48:46.534 --> 02:48:47.635]  They've got to go out and fight!
[02:48:47.695 --> 02:48:49.776]  And they saw a white male with a camera!
[02:48:50.117 --> 02:48:50.997]  This is Art Park!
[02:48:51.237 --> 02:48:52.679]  Get me some muscle over here!
[02:48:53.039 --> 02:48:57.703]  She, this is her coming of age, like an 18-year-old man joining the Marines, because daddy did it.
[02:48:58.609 --> 02:49:05.955]  But when the men cease to be men, the women will become men, but they will become asexual drones of the state.
[02:49:06.235 --> 02:49:07.256]  And this is the drone.
[02:49:07.536 --> 02:49:09.158]  This is the rise of the robot, right here.
[02:49:09.898 --> 02:49:15.643]  And this is because of the failure of men to protect women, who are the species.
[02:49:18.225 --> 02:49:23.890]  The woman, early on in utero, decides what to do with the fetus, and depending culturally on what's going on, different things give rise.
[02:49:24.511 --> 02:49:25.491]  And so, women
[02:49:26.533 --> 02:49:30.054]  Have been captured, as Hitler said, first you get the women, then you got the children, so follow the men.
[02:49:30.074 --> 02:49:31.875]  80% of advertising targets women.
[02:49:33.295 --> 02:49:34.835]  We're a show that mainly targets men.
[02:49:34.935 --> 02:49:35.476]  Women, listen.
[02:49:35.896 --> 02:49:39.897]  And by targeting men, we didn't come out and say, I target men, I'm a man, I have a male message.
[02:49:41.817 --> 02:49:46.739]  And I have real men listening to this show, who understand that it's about the species.
[02:49:47.984 --> 02:49:56.687]  But this woman thinks the species is the enemy because she works for this big operation, you know, Skeletor back here, the eugenics death combine.
[02:49:59.969 --> 02:50:02.890]  I could deprogram her in one weekend though with all the case study documents.
[02:50:03.130 --> 02:50:04.210]  I could deprogram that woman.
[02:50:05.190 --> 02:50:08.572]  The problem is I can't reach all these people.
[02:50:08.632 --> 02:50:09.672]  Let's play some more.
[02:50:09.712 --> 02:50:10.192]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:50:11.033 --> 02:50:12.393]  No, you need to get out.
[02:50:12.773 --> 02:50:13.734]  You need to get out.
[02:50:13.814 --> 02:50:14.254]  No, I don't.
[02:50:15.285 --> 02:50:16.226]  You need to get out.
[02:50:16.766 --> 02:50:17.347]  I actually don't.
[02:50:17.487 --> 02:50:17.807]  All right.
[02:50:18.287 --> 02:50:21.389]  Hey, who wants to help me get this reporter out of here?
[02:50:21.509 --> 02:50:23.371]  I need some muscle over here.
[02:50:23.411 --> 02:50:25.132]  Be quiet!
[02:50:25.933 --> 02:50:26.833]  For all humans.
[02:50:26.873 --> 02:50:27.554]  Can I hit pause?
[02:50:27.574 --> 02:50:30.556]  I'm going to come back and play the whole thing in the next segment.
[02:50:30.656 --> 02:50:31.456]  The David Knight's coming up.
[02:50:31.476 --> 02:50:32.497]  But I just want to add something.
[02:50:32.717 --> 02:50:33.398]  There's a bunch of this.
[02:50:34.238 --> 02:50:35.219]  Them trying to stop free speech.
[02:50:35.900 --> 02:50:37.581]  Notice there's always Muslim women.
[02:50:38.735 --> 02:50:39.676]  Get these demonstrations.
[02:50:39.716 --> 02:50:44.142]  Let's say Muslim women are, what, 1-2% of the US population.
[02:50:44.663 --> 02:50:44.803]  Maybe 3.
[02:50:46.843 --> 02:50:51.206]  And they're not allowed to talk outside their house if they're, you know, mainline what's taking over Islam.
[02:50:51.426 --> 02:50:51.966]  They're not allowed.
[02:50:51.986 --> 02:50:52.647]  They're slaves.
[02:50:52.827 --> 02:51:00.752]  But they're always there to make sure the West knows, especially white males and Christians know, hey, you even existing gets in my way.
[02:51:01.392 --> 02:51:09.958]  And then the jihadis are more than happy to have their wives and daughters out, you know, out there with their arms crossed all mad in the freest country in the world, bitching about everything.

[02:52:08.651 --> 02:52:11.473]  Brain Force is here.
[02:52:11.993 --> 02:52:14.275]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:52:14.535 --> 02:52:22.361]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[02:52:23.140 --> 02:52:26.723]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[02:52:26.743 --> 02:52:29.085]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:52:29.445 --> 02:52:32.948]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:52:33.008 --> 02:52:36.130]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:52:36.651 --> 02:52:41.435]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:52:41.975 --> 02:52:43.817]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[02:52:44.157 --> 02:52:48.601]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:52:48.741 --> 02:52:50.762]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:52:51.383 --> 02:52:52.844]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:52:52.984 --> 02:52:53.244]  Exactly.
[02:52:53.264 --> 02:52:57.068]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:52:57.548 --> 02:53:04.816]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:53:05.096 --> 02:53:05.556]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[02:53:10.293 --> 02:53:11.674]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:53:11.954 --> 02:53:13.234]  You can't survive without it.
[02:53:13.434 --> 02:53:14.335]  But where do you get it?

[02:53:46.285 --> 02:53:47.465]  Stainless steel construction.
[02:53:47.746 --> 02:53:48.526]  Easy assembly.
[02:53:48.786 --> 02:53:49.407]  Low maintenance.
[02:53:49.707 --> 02:53:51.528]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[02:54:15.078 --> 02:54:18.940]  Oh, it's such a nice place.
[02:54:19.280 --> 02:54:20.481]  My emotions had an echo.
[02:54:20.501 --> 02:54:23.302]  Now this guy knows what he's talking about.
[02:54:23.322 --> 02:54:24.383]  Ha ha, when you're out there.
[02:54:24.763 --> 02:54:26.924]  But it wasn't because I didn't know enough.
[02:54:27.004 --> 02:54:27.644]  I knew too much.
[02:54:41.827 --> 02:54:42.828]  I know so much.
[02:54:43.068 --> 02:54:44.329]  I've been studying this.
[02:54:44.389 --> 02:54:46.210]  Anybody can do this stuff.
[02:54:46.270 --> 02:54:47.291]  It's been 25 years.
[02:54:48.231 --> 02:54:49.032]  I know how they operate.
[02:54:49.052 --> 02:54:50.292]  I know what their backstory is.
[02:54:50.312 --> 02:54:51.593]  I know their algorithm.
[02:54:52.714 --> 02:54:55.296]  And you just see the whole thing.
[02:54:55.316 --> 02:54:57.577]  You see the code of the Matrix.
[02:55:01.920 --> 02:55:03.821]  Speaking of this, I'm gonna shoot a special report.
[02:55:06.860 --> 02:55:14.964]  For the nightly news about this, rich Americans seek black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[02:55:15.364 --> 02:55:18.806]  It's like thumbprints 15 years ago to get into your Mercedes or whatever.
[02:55:19.366 --> 02:55:20.687]  You know, the fancier computers.
[02:55:20.727 --> 02:55:22.107]  They make the slavery cool.
[02:55:22.568 --> 02:55:27.930]  The self-driving cars, Audi and Mercedes and Toyota are already coming off on the nicest models.
[02:55:30.191 --> 02:55:31.772]  And then you're paying for your own enslavement.
[02:55:34.462 --> 02:55:35.143]  Well, there you go.
[02:55:35.324 --> 02:55:37.347]  I wrote about that in a book 16 years ago.
[02:55:37.367 --> 02:55:39.571]  People made fun of me and I was going off DARPA documents.
[02:55:40.673 --> 02:55:41.995]  It's already going on.
[02:55:42.276 --> 02:55:43.979]  The future is here.
[02:55:44.119 --> 02:55:47.705]  It's just not evenly distributed as many futurists have said.
[02:55:48.817 --> 02:55:52.220]  We start the next segment, I'm going to go ahead and announce that Bernie Sanders meme contest two weeks late.
[02:55:52.480 --> 02:55:54.542]  But I always hit the contest though, just sometimes late.
[02:55:54.942 --> 02:55:55.643]  So that's coming up.
[02:55:56.324 --> 02:56:00.347]  Right now, let me play this Social Justice Warrior clip, as I mentioned, and they put it together.
[02:56:00.708 --> 02:56:02.229]  Just a few of them suppressing free speech.
[02:56:02.269 --> 02:56:08.835]  And then separately, we are extending the brain force nootropic one more day, but then I promise it is over because of supplies.
[02:56:09.095 --> 02:56:10.116]  The sales have been very successful.
[02:56:10.136 --> 02:56:10.676]  We're extending it.
[02:56:11.557 --> 02:56:12.418]  No, you need to get out!
[02:56:12.438 --> 02:56:13.098]  You need to get out!
[02:56:13.118 --> 02:56:13.338]  No, I don't.
[02:56:34.702 --> 02:56:35.643]  You need to get out.
[02:56:36.163 --> 02:56:36.784]  I actually don't.
[02:56:36.864 --> 02:56:39.586]  And no matter where you are, it's a safe space they control.
[02:56:40.406 --> 02:56:41.487]  They now say the streets are theirs.
[02:56:42.428 --> 02:56:44.549]  He's not allowed to have speech.
[02:56:45.710 --> 02:56:47.552]  Look how pathetic these young kids are.
[02:56:47.672 --> 02:56:48.512]  Spit's on him.
[02:56:48.632 --> 02:56:55.537]  And in the full video, the Trump people are so nice, the Infowars folks, who are wearing Infowars shirts, are so nice to the quote, tranny.
[02:57:06.190 --> 02:57:07.471]  You have not done that.
[02:57:07.511 --> 02:57:10.233]  By sending out that email, that goes against your position.
[02:57:10.253 --> 02:57:12.194]  They're like just scummy hate people.
[02:57:12.775 --> 02:57:14.216]  They're also stupid.
[02:57:14.236 --> 02:57:16.758]  That's the professors we have for speech math.
[02:57:16.858 --> 02:57:18.279]  No, we don't stop him.
[02:57:18.299 --> 02:57:18.839]  I'm scared.
[02:57:26.852 --> 02:57:27.533]  It is not!
[02:57:27.553 --> 02:57:28.874]  Do you understand that?
[02:57:29.454 --> 02:57:30.995]  It's about creating a home here!
[02:57:31.316 --> 02:57:33.257]  You're not doing that!
[02:57:33.398 --> 02:57:34.799]  You're supposed to be our advocate!
[02:57:35.439 --> 02:57:37.061]  We can't have free speech!
[02:57:37.521 --> 02:57:37.981]  Stop it!
[02:57:38.021 --> 02:57:38.422]  Shut up!
[02:57:38.482 --> 02:57:39.022]  I read everything!
[02:57:39.383 --> 02:57:44.687]  Hey, do we have the clip in there where they see him pull more shirts and they go... How do you explain that?
[02:57:45.027 --> 02:57:47.610]  These freshmen coming and they think this is what Yale is?
[02:57:47.630 --> 02:57:49.651]  Do you hear that?
[02:57:50.172 --> 02:57:55.056]  They're gonna leave, they're gonna transfer because... She's screaming so loud it's bouncing off buildings 100 yards away.
[02:57:56.567 --> 02:57:58.069]  You did not sleep at night!
[02:58:00.151 --> 02:58:02.793]  Is that dumb, everybody?
[02:58:02.853 --> 02:58:03.454]  Is this real dumb?
[02:58:03.474 --> 02:58:06.437]  I mean, these kids are... I call them kids because they're just, like, arrested development.
[02:58:06.457 --> 02:58:13.404]  Just walk around all... What's your view?
[02:58:13.484 --> 02:58:14.285]  I'm an intellectual.
[02:58:14.305 --> 02:58:16.647]  I'm an intellectual.
[02:58:16.707 --> 02:58:17.228]  I watch MSNBC.
[02:58:17.248 --> 02:58:18.048]  Can't even talk.
[02:58:21.311 --> 02:58:22.611]  Don't say father, don't say mother!
[02:58:22.792 --> 02:58:24.012]  They're like demons!
[02:58:24.032 --> 02:58:26.313]  No father, no mother, no humans!
[02:58:26.613 --> 02:58:27.293]  Humans are evil!
[02:58:27.313 --> 02:58:28.874]  Kill everyone!
[02:58:29.334 --> 02:58:30.614]  I love Satan!
[02:58:30.894 --> 02:58:31.895]  It's interdimensional, folks.
[02:58:31.915 --> 02:58:32.955]  They're demon possessed, I guess.
[02:58:34.456 --> 02:58:40.298]  The more footage you watch of them, it's just... We come from the pit of hell upon us all!
[02:58:42.063 --> 02:58:43.044]  They all just watch TV.
[02:58:43.064 --> 02:58:44.484]  They have no soul, have no brain, I guess.
[02:58:44.724 --> 02:58:45.605]  Stuff out of hell entered them.
[02:58:45.645 --> 02:58:46.265]  I mean, whatever.
[02:58:46.285 --> 02:58:48.206]  I mean, is Rachel Maddow off this planet?
[02:58:48.646 --> 02:58:49.266]  Obviously not.
[02:58:49.306 --> 02:58:50.487]  A goblin creature she is.
[02:58:50.987 --> 02:58:51.987]  Yoda needed to defeat her.
[02:58:52.007 --> 02:58:53.768]  Alright, I'm having some comedy fun here.
[02:58:53.788 --> 02:58:55.229]  MSNBC will say I'm being serious.
[02:58:56.029 --> 02:58:57.310]  I think I kind of am.
[02:58:57.690 --> 02:58:58.510]  Everybody knows.
[02:58:58.610 --> 02:58:59.591]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[02:59:00.487 --> 02:59:09.517]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:59:09.598 --> 02:59:17.687]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:17.987 --> 02:59:22.669]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:59:22.849 --> 02:59:29.572]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:29.652 --> 02:59:36.734]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:59:36.834 --> 02:59:43.677]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:59:43.837 --> 02:59:48.201]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:59:48.321 --> 02:59:51.584]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:59:51.724 --> 02:59:57.850]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:59:58.030 --> 03:00:00.252]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:00:02.995 --> 03:00:05.637]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:18.484 --> 03:00:19.325]  I love Satan.
[03:00:19.385 --> 03:00:20.326]  I kill my kids.
[03:00:20.406 --> 03:00:20.906]  I'm ugly.
[03:00:20.966 --> 03:00:21.847]  I've hurt my eyes.
[03:00:21.867 --> 03:00:26.771]  From the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:26.791 --> 03:00:28.613]  Your brother is in hell.
[03:00:28.693 --> 03:00:29.894]  Your mother is in hell.
[03:00:30.094 --> 03:00:31.055]  Everyone's in hell.
[03:00:31.215 --> 03:00:35.038]  Then she spews out the green pea soup, the exorcist.
[03:00:35.738 --> 03:00:39.842]  I used to see movies like that and think, man, there's nothing like this in the real world.
[03:00:40.322 --> 03:00:42.364]  Then I've run into people that are like Linda Blair.
[03:00:43.544 --> 03:00:45.907]  Literally, the same face, everything.
[03:00:45.987 --> 03:00:48.830]  And it's always like, we're liberal, we rule, everything.
[03:00:48.991 --> 03:00:56.700]  They get out a $100,000 black sports car and just run around like, we're ugly, demons.
[03:00:58.061 --> 03:00:59.803]  Let's attack the candy cat people.
[03:01:00.024 --> 03:01:01.265]  We love dead babies.
[03:01:01.946 --> 03:01:03.468]  And I'm not kidding, that's who we face.
[03:01:05.799 --> 03:01:06.680]  Down at the Capitol.
[03:01:07.100 --> 03:01:09.743]  They always had Christians there trying to get a pro-life thing.
[03:01:10.164 --> 03:01:12.366]  Women just spontaneously showed up and went, Hail Satan!
[03:01:12.386 --> 03:01:12.987]  Hail Satan!
[03:01:13.027 --> 03:01:16.150]  And were like, flicking their tongues out by the dozens and dozens.
[03:01:16.170 --> 03:01:17.292]  It was on national news.
[03:01:20.134 --> 03:01:22.775]  And they've watched TV so long, I guess they're in a trance.
[03:01:23.035 --> 03:01:23.895]  And they're like, gone.
[03:01:24.716 --> 03:01:26.076]  I'm looking at this scientifically.
[03:01:26.816 --> 03:01:36.500]  Where are women just suddenly hailing Satan and sticking their tongues out and like... Or is that what they think is the archetype of what is powerful and naughty?
[03:01:38.527 --> 03:01:41.629]  There it is, abortion act was caught on camera possessed by spooky hell Satan Chan.
[03:01:42.210 --> 03:01:44.231]  And this is like women in business suits and stuff too.
[03:01:44.591 --> 03:01:46.453]  They just kind of like, like they're all channeling.
[03:01:47.133 --> 03:01:48.634]  I guess there's some power in dead babies.
[03:01:48.654 --> 03:01:49.875]  Dead babies are ours!
[03:01:50.055 --> 03:01:51.416]  We have risen from the pit of hell!
[03:01:51.577 --> 03:01:52.797]  You will not stop our snacks!
[03:01:53.018 --> 03:01:53.558]  Dead babies!
[03:01:53.858 --> 03:01:58.702]  I mean, I guess that's who shows up when you're trying to stop, you know, their delectable activity.
[03:02:02.688 --> 03:02:09.392]  There's all these Christians praying and there's all these women surrounding them and they go... And I'm kind of doing my exorcist sounds now.
[03:02:09.692 --> 03:02:10.513]  They're kind of addictive.
[03:02:11.153 --> 03:02:12.894]  You know what, maybe we should just join these people.
[03:02:12.934 --> 03:02:15.716]  Just run around and go, I'm ugly, I hate babies.
[03:02:15.756 --> 03:02:16.977]  Doesn't that sound fun?
[03:02:18.818 --> 03:02:22.460]  Look how good looking these Christians are and wholesome of every race, color, and creed.
[03:02:22.480 --> 03:02:27.103]  And then there's the goblin creatures that show up of every race, color, and creed and just start gobbling around.
[03:02:28.484 --> 03:02:31.366]  In fact, maybe David Knight, we should come in maybe with the A-Team.
[03:02:32.554 --> 03:02:34.295]  Let me bring put together the abortion team.
[03:02:34.716 --> 03:02:38.459]  If you need a group of smelly-looking devil worshippers, then you need the A-Team.
[03:02:38.859 --> 03:02:40.220]  Dun-da-dun-dun!
[03:02:40.580 --> 03:02:41.821]  Dun-dun-dun!
[03:02:42.142 --> 03:02:42.982]  I kill my kids!
[03:02:43.102 --> 03:02:43.843]  I love Satan!
[03:02:44.123 --> 03:02:45.064]  Dun-da-dun-dun!
[03:02:45.084 --> 03:02:46.125]  Oh, you're so intellectual!
[03:02:46.365 --> 03:02:47.286]  You're so liberal!
[03:02:47.326 --> 03:02:47.826]  You want to end?
[03:02:48.126 --> 03:02:52.089]  I'm telling you, anywhere you go, red flags, black uniforms, devil worship!
[03:02:54.071 --> 03:02:54.631]  So we're fighting!
[03:02:54.772 --> 03:02:56.573]  That's all I'm saying!
[03:02:56.653 --> 03:02:58.795]  If that doesn't make you a stronger Christian, I don't know what does.
[03:03:01.078 --> 03:03:03.321]  If that doesn't make you... I mean, just look at these people!
[03:03:03.361 --> 03:03:05.083]  And the truth is, they aren't tough.
[03:03:05.163 --> 03:03:06.465]  They've never been stressed.
[03:03:06.805 --> 03:03:11.711]  They live in a totally decadent society and are just an example of spoiled, rotten kids.
[03:03:11.731 --> 03:03:18.279]  I mean, can you imagine throwing that guy in a gladiatorial arena right there?
[03:03:20.959 --> 03:03:23.781]  No, he gets a thrill out of thinking about a lot of dead babies.
[03:03:23.861 --> 03:03:25.262]  I fund hundreds of dead kids.
[03:03:25.722 --> 03:03:26.242]  I like it.
[03:03:26.263 --> 03:03:26.843]  I'm a real man.
[03:03:26.863 --> 03:03:28.424]  Oh, you're a real man, aren't you?
[03:03:29.044 --> 03:03:31.046]  And he'd cry for your mommy so quick.
[03:03:33.427 --> 03:03:41.132]  You were in a room and some guy walked in with a big old sharp double-edged sword like those babies fight for their lives and said, I'm just hypothetically, I would never want any harm upon you.
[03:03:42.413 --> 03:03:44.995]  You're like stepping on a pile of dog manure, but imagine
[03:03:46.206 --> 03:03:51.848]  That guy in a room and he can even be armed and some, you know, gladiator walks in and says, pick up the weapon.
[03:03:52.648 --> 03:03:54.488]  It'd be, I have a life that matters.
[03:03:54.889 --> 03:03:57.069]  No, no, please don't.
[03:03:57.689 --> 03:03:58.170]  Yes.
[03:03:58.730 --> 03:03:59.430]  Pick it up.
[03:04:02.451 --> 03:04:02.771]  Oh, no.
[03:04:02.791 --> 03:04:04.431]  You just get off on defenseless babies.
[03:04:04.652 --> 03:04:06.632]  That's what the big man's into.
[03:04:07.672 --> 03:04:08.933]  And you're like, oh, it's for the women.
[03:04:08.953 --> 03:04:10.193]  That's why I have devil tattoos.
[03:04:10.393 --> 03:04:11.734]  I care about women's rights.
[03:04:12.094 --> 03:04:15.895]  No, you're attracted to the dead and dying like the demon worm you are.
[03:04:18.667 --> 03:04:19.308]  Miserable.
[03:04:24.191 --> 03:04:25.352]  Defilers of life.
[03:04:26.032 --> 03:04:27.253]  You know what falsehood says.
[03:04:30.375 --> 03:04:31.876]  Continuing, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:04:32.737 --> 03:04:35.219]  We have the white people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[03:04:35.619 --> 03:04:36.800]  Bernie Sanders meme contest.
[03:04:36.820 --> 03:04:37.961]  We're gonna post this now.
[03:04:37.981 --> 03:04:39.662]  $1,500 in prizes and a Hillary for prison t-shirt.
[03:04:42.446 --> 03:04:44.007]  I'll make sure they find out.
[03:04:44.087 --> 03:04:44.708]  That's the winner.
[03:04:44.908 --> 03:04:46.910]  White people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[03:04:46.970 --> 03:04:48.031]  I'll make sure they find out.
[03:04:48.511 --> 03:04:50.253]  Truston Judeau.
[03:04:51.273 --> 03:04:51.894]  They're on Twitter.
[03:04:53.255 --> 03:04:54.476]  And he wins $1,000.
[03:04:55.997 --> 03:04:56.538]  Suzanne.
[03:04:56.898 --> 03:04:57.699]  Suzanne Corner.
[03:04:57.839 --> 03:04:58.600]  She wins $500.
[03:04:58.900 --> 03:05:00.581]  Bless her, the poor says Christ.
[03:05:00.621 --> 03:05:02.082]  Except for white people, says Bernie Sanders.
[03:05:02.543 --> 03:05:03.464]  Infowars.com.
[03:05:03.484 --> 03:05:04.044]  That's second place, $500.
[03:05:04.204 --> 03:05:06.066]  And this fella gets a free t-shirt.
[03:05:06.106 --> 03:05:07.907]  Herman0982.
[03:05:08.448 --> 03:05:09.669]  My initials are BS for a reason.
[03:05:11.087 --> 03:05:14.029]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[03:05:14.329 --> 03:05:23.914]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by Infowarslife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[03:05:24.214 --> 03:05:29.416]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[03:05:29.516 --> 03:05:38.381]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[03:05:38.621 --> 03:05:47.189]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[03:05:47.449 --> 03:05:54.355]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spigyrex herbal processing technique.
[03:05:54.515 --> 03:05:59.840]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you the best.
[03:06:00.180 --> 03:06:01.021]  Brain Force is here.
[03:06:01.041 --> 03:06:04.304]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:06:04.344 --> 03:06:11.310]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[03:06:23.420 --> 03:06:26.582]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[03:06:26.862 --> 03:06:26.983]  Right?
[03:06:27.003 --> 03:06:29.344]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[03:06:29.724 --> 03:06:33.207]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[03:06:33.267 --> 03:06:36.409]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[03:06:36.909 --> 03:06:42.133]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[03:06:42.253 --> 03:06:44.094]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[03:06:44.434 --> 03:06:48.857]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[03:06:49.017 --> 03:06:51.039]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[03:06:51.659 --> 03:06:53.120]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[03:06:53.260 --> 03:06:53.520]  Exactly.
[03:06:53.540 --> 03:06:57.344]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[03:06:57.825 --> 03:07:05.832]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:07:10.509 --> 03:07:13.811]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[03:07:13.971 --> 03:07:16.233]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[03:07:16.413 --> 03:07:24.799]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[03:07:25.059 --> 03:07:28.401]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[03:07:28.541 --> 03:07:40.449]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula, sourced from powerful
[03:07:40.609 --> 03:07:41.149]  I don't know.
[03:08:11.329 --> 03:08:18.533]  In today's world, abortion supporters routinely attend pro-life rallies and attempt to bully activists.
[03:08:19.313 --> 03:08:27.317]  If you have a problem and need a smelly group of commie devil worshippers, maybe you can call the A-Team.
[03:08:29.358 --> 03:08:31.279]  How many did I adopt?
[03:08:31.499 --> 03:08:32.339]  I kill my kids!
[03:08:32.819 --> 03:08:33.960]  I kill my kids!
[03:08:37.607 --> 03:08:44.154]  Hey, we saw your Facebook with your communist hammer and sickle.
[03:08:44.955 --> 03:08:45.816]  That's pretty cool, man.
[03:08:46.937 --> 03:08:48.138]  Is that you on the Facebook?
[03:08:50.721 --> 03:08:52.863]  Is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle?
[03:08:53.664 --> 03:08:54.505]  I don't think so.
[03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:04.903]  How do you get your abortions paid for?
[03:09:04.923 --> 03:09:06.264]  I pay for them.
[03:09:06.364 --> 03:09:08.446]  How many do you pay for them?
[03:09:08.787 --> 03:09:09.207]  Upwards of 50.
[03:09:09.287 --> 03:09:09.727]  Really?
[03:09:10.368 --> 03:09:10.688]  Oh yeah.
[03:09:12.650 --> 03:09:16.714]  F**k you, you piece of s**t!
[03:09:17.114 --> 03:09:18.935]  Bunch of misogynist motherf**kers.
[03:09:18.955 --> 03:09:20.277]  Take your male privilege somewhere else.
[03:09:20.757 --> 03:09:22.098]  Tava, you're being aggressive.
[03:09:22.118 --> 03:09:22.899]  I'm being aggressive.
[03:09:22.919 --> 03:09:23.980]  Follow the laws!
[03:09:24.520 --> 03:09:25.782]  Get those arms!
[03:09:25.822 --> 03:09:26.682]  Watch out!
[03:09:26.722 --> 03:09:27.163]  Watch out!
[03:09:27.981 --> 03:09:31.204]  At least that's the guys that attacked Alex Jones.
[03:09:39.693 --> 03:09:44.759]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:09:48.806 --> 03:09:50.047]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:09:50.087 --> 03:09:50.628]  I'm David Knight.
[03:09:50.668 --> 03:09:53.270]  On this fourth hour, Wednesday, April 20th, 2016.
[03:09:53.611 --> 03:09:56.173]  Of course, last night we had the New York primaries.
[03:09:56.754 --> 03:10:02.359]  We were here, Ja'Kari Jackson and I and the crew were here covering the returns as they came in live.
[03:10:02.379 --> 03:10:03.820]  And we'll give you a couple of metrics here.
[03:10:03.840 --> 03:10:11.547]  We're going to look at what's ahead in the race from an analytical standpoint, but also what happens next in some of these states that are coming up.
[03:10:12.248 --> 03:10:17.032]  We also have some updates on the polio issue that I talked about yesterday.
[03:10:17.212 --> 03:10:18.853]  Very interesting development with that.
[03:10:19.533 --> 03:10:26.939]  As well as Watchdog Press Agency, Reporters Without Borders, saying we have entered a new era of propaganda in the media.
[03:10:26.959 --> 03:10:34.084]  And of course, that's referring to government methods of control of the method, of the message.
[03:10:35.645 --> 03:10:37.927]  The method is the message now, I guess.
[03:10:38.627 --> 03:10:40.669]  Also, we have Lindsey Graham
[03:10:41.380 --> 03:10:46.383]  Flipping on the legislation to give compensation to victims.
[03:10:46.483 --> 03:10:47.503]  Isn't that very interesting?
[03:10:47.523 --> 03:10:57.589]  We just had a bill pass giving compensation to victims of Iranian terror, going back to the 1983 attack in Beirut when Ronald Reagan was president.
[03:10:58.249 --> 03:11:03.835]  They've now said that Americans should be able to sue Iran for that terrorist attack.
[03:11:04.035 --> 03:11:17.849]  And yet, the same people in Congress are now starting to argue, the leadership of Congress, people like Lindsey Graham and Paul Ryan are now saying that the victims' families of 9-11 should not be allowed to sue the Saudis.
[03:11:19.054 --> 03:11:35.769]  As we look at the declassification of the missing 28 pages, the redacted 28 pages, and as that narrative begins to unfold, we have a story pointing out how 9-11's official conspiracy theory is really starting to unravel.
[03:11:35.809 --> 03:11:37.911]  That's the story by Kit Daniels on Infowars.com.
[03:11:38.732 --> 03:11:39.993]  As we just finished looking at
[03:11:41.235 --> 03:11:46.499]  Some of the social justice warriors, the A-team, the abortion team that Darren put together there.
[03:11:46.939 --> 03:11:49.681]  You know, we have this new guy here in Austin.
[03:11:49.901 --> 03:11:51.022]  It's made national news.
[03:11:51.422 --> 03:11:55.185]  The guy who has become the Tawana Brawley of cake decoration.
[03:11:55.265 --> 03:11:57.247]  This is this gay pastor here in Austin.
[03:11:57.867 --> 03:12:07.559]  He says that he went to Whole Foods and got a cake and they put the word fag in the middle of it and it wasn't there when you look at the... There it is.
[03:12:07.599 --> 03:12:08.360]  It's blurred out.
[03:12:08.400 --> 03:12:09.842]  I guess we can't say that or something.
[03:12:09.882 --> 03:12:12.546]  It's the other F word that we can't say maybe on the radio.
[03:12:13.809 --> 03:12:19.331]  When you look at the surveillance video that Whole Foods has produced, that wasn't there in the center.
[03:12:19.872 --> 03:12:26.295]  They'd order a cake, it said, love wins around the edge, and as everybody talks about, you know, when you go to pick up a cake, what does the baker do?
[03:12:26.355 --> 03:12:27.715]  They say, how does this look?
[03:12:27.895 --> 03:12:28.676]  Is this what you wanted?
[03:12:28.696 --> 03:12:29.816]  And you say, yeah, you know.
[03:12:29.916 --> 03:12:36.399]  But five hours later, he does a tearful admission, just like Tawana Brawley, saying, look what they wrote on me!
[03:12:36.459 --> 03:12:38.180]  No, not on me, on my cake, right?
[03:12:39.978 --> 03:12:43.162]  So, now Whole Foods says, hey, you know what, we're going to sue you.
[03:12:43.943 --> 03:12:50.951]  They said that the cake was made by an LGBT advocate, nonetheless, and so this gay pastor now...
[03:12:52.335 --> 03:12:54.356]  I think he's going to get busted for a cake fake.
[03:12:56.036 --> 03:12:57.637]  He can't have his cake and sue him too.
[03:12:58.917 --> 03:13:05.699]  Now, on some serious news, we talked yesterday about the story that started developing over the weekend.
[03:13:05.719 --> 03:13:13.502]  I think the first place I saw it was on Friday in National Geographic, talking about how they're going to replace all the polio vaccines worldwide.
[03:13:14.309 --> 03:13:16.049]  And they're going to do it within these next two weeks.
[03:13:16.089 --> 03:13:20.490]  And they want all of these to be incinerated or buried.
[03:13:20.670 --> 03:13:25.832]  They want to eradicate the polio vaccines so they can therefore eradicate polio.
[03:13:26.092 --> 03:13:28.272]  Because they say the vaccines are causing polio.
[03:13:28.612 --> 03:13:31.833]  But don't worry, they've got a new and improved vaccine that they're going to give you.
[03:13:31.853 --> 03:13:35.154]  We had a story that Adan Salazar put up yesterday on Infowars.com.
[03:13:35.854 --> 03:13:40.960]  Scientists work to destroy old polio vaccine after admitting it causes polio.
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:43.002]  There were some amazing admissions in there.
[03:13:43.022 --> 03:13:48.267]  Yeah, you know, we got these live viruses and they can mutate and they can actually give you polio.
[03:13:49.368 --> 03:13:54.073]  They haven't admitted that the SV40, simian virus 40, number 40, that was
[03:13:56.002 --> 03:14:00.164]  Uh, given to children for quite some time in their polio vaccines.
[03:14:00.204 --> 03:14:01.584]  That's a cancer virus.
[03:14:02.325 --> 03:14:08.447]  And they said, well, you know, yeah, it was in the viruses and we found it in tumors of people and autopsies.
[03:14:08.507 --> 03:14:11.388]  But that doesn't mean that it caused the cancer.
[03:14:11.408 --> 03:14:14.670]  It's just, you know, it's kind of like you find a guy on the floor.
[03:14:15.550 --> 03:14:30.700]  And the guy is standing there with a smoking gun, and he's got .38 caliber bullets in his gun, and there's .38 caliber bullets in the dead guy on the floor, but they said, you know, you didn't see it go in him, so we don't really think there's any cause and effect here.
[03:14:31.980 --> 03:14:37.764]  That's when the people running the investigation are the murderers, okay?
[03:14:38.524 --> 03:14:44.148]  So now we've got this curious case of this happening in an update that Nico gave me here that just happened today.
[03:14:44.248 --> 03:14:49.171]  Gunmen kill seven policemen who were guarding a polio team in Pakistan.
[03:14:49.931 --> 03:14:55.235]  Understand, they're going to get rid of these polio vaccinations within the next two weeks.
[03:14:55.275 --> 03:14:56.095]  I said, we've got to get rid of them.
[03:14:56.275 --> 03:14:56.816]  Got to get rid of them.
[03:14:56.916 --> 03:14:57.996]  They're dangerous, okay?
[03:14:59.116 --> 03:15:02.319]  Gotta be eradicated, gotta bury them, burn them, incinerate them.
[03:15:03.119 --> 03:15:06.742]  But they're still inoculating people with this old stuff.
[03:15:07.403 --> 03:15:07.623]  Right?
[03:15:08.103 --> 03:15:08.564]  Don't you think?
[03:15:08.784 --> 03:15:11.006]  I mean, have they got the new stuff out yet?
[03:15:11.426 --> 03:15:14.648]  Have they eradicated the polio vaccine in Pakistan yet?
[03:15:15.269 --> 03:15:22.475]  Motorcycle gunman on Wednesday shot dead seven policemen who were guarding a polio vaccination team in Pakistan's southern port city of Karachi, officials said.
[03:15:22.855 --> 03:15:26.017]  A brazen attack in the country's economic hub.
[03:15:26.766 --> 03:15:31.848]  They say the polio workers who are unharmed in the attack were on the third day of an immunization drive.
[03:15:32.348 --> 03:15:34.369]  And again, we have to ask, are they still using the old stuff?
[03:15:34.589 --> 03:15:38.891]  They say Pakistan is one of the only two countries in the world where polio remains endemic.
[03:15:38.951 --> 03:15:46.894]  Attempts to eradicate it have been badly hit by militant attacks on immunization teams that have claimed more than 100 lives since December 2012.
[03:15:47.355 --> 03:15:50.596]  Are these people Luddites or do they know something that the American public doesn't?
[03:15:51.550 --> 03:16:01.672]  You see, we've seen all these reports that have been poo-pooed in the mainstream western press saying that there are tens of thousands of people who have contracted polio after they've been injected.
[03:16:01.692 --> 03:16:10.874]  And you know, it doesn't take too long for word of mouth to spread when you give your kid an injection and all of a sudden they get sick.
[03:16:10.914 --> 03:16:17.956]  They come down with autism or they come down with weak paralysis-like symptoms that for the longest time
[03:16:19.079 --> 03:16:23.902]  The big pharma, CDC people were telling us, that's not polio, that's not polio.
[03:16:24.002 --> 03:16:25.923]  It's polio-like symptoms.
[03:16:25.963 --> 03:16:27.724]  Don't worry, it's unrelated.
[03:16:28.185 --> 03:16:30.226]  It's kind of like it, but it's not the same thing.
[03:16:30.266 --> 03:16:32.307]  And now they're saying, well, these things are mutating.
[03:16:33.908 --> 03:16:36.470]  And we have these strains that are doing this.
[03:16:36.510 --> 03:16:45.976]  We had all these stories that were surfacing last summer talking about these mutated polio-like strains that people were coming down with in large numbers.
[03:16:47.250 --> 03:16:49.552]  Looked just like polio, but don't worry, it wasn't polio.
[03:16:49.572 --> 03:16:50.613]  It wasn't from the vaccines.
[03:16:50.633 --> 03:16:51.033]  They're safe.
[03:16:51.313 --> 03:16:52.014]  They're safe, really.
[03:16:52.334 --> 03:16:53.095]  You can trust us.
[03:16:53.595 --> 03:16:55.657]  The vaccines are totally safe.
[03:16:56.117 --> 03:17:01.802]  We've taken out the cancer virus that was in them before, so that's not in there anymore.
[03:17:02.202 --> 03:17:05.865]  And don't worry, we've taken out the aluminum that was in the MMRI, so that's not there.
[03:17:05.885 --> 03:17:08.467]  I mean, it's not aluminum, the mercury.
[03:17:08.487 --> 03:17:09.949]  I think the aluminum is still in there.
[03:17:10.549 --> 03:17:13.151]  You know, but we got maybe some new stuff we're gonna put in.
[03:17:13.351 --> 03:17:14.592]  New and proved, okay?
[03:17:15.533 --> 03:17:21.120]  So, when you see this happening to your children, it gets some people in some countries kind of mad.
[03:17:21.140 --> 03:17:28.990]  And they kind of get the idea that there's a different kind of agenda with these vaccination schedules, whether or not the people at the lower level believe that.
[03:17:29.010 --> 03:17:31.574]  And I think the people at lower level believe they're doing good, okay?
[03:17:32.412 --> 03:17:36.635]  It's the people who are making the vaccines who know what's really going on with this.
[03:17:36.815 --> 03:17:42.519]  Just like there's different levels within the government, just as we're starting to see this 9-11 narrative unfold.
[03:17:42.559 --> 03:17:51.566]  And we had people who were doing brave things, risking their lives, losing their lives as firemen, as policemen, as individuals trying to save other people.
[03:17:51.626 --> 03:17:53.147]  But then there's these people at the top.
[03:17:54.138 --> 03:17:55.659]  These people who are running the situation.
[03:17:55.699 --> 03:17:58.020]  They call that eyewash in the CIA.
[03:17:58.040 --> 03:18:01.561]  And of course, the connection is going to be really interesting.
[03:18:01.621 --> 03:18:11.505]  Why they are so desperate to protect all this stuff with Saudi Arabia is because these breadcrumbs are starting to lead back to Prince Bandar.
[03:18:12.366 --> 03:18:16.930]  Who was, and has been, linked with the CIA for a long time.
[03:18:16.950 --> 03:18:24.357]  And of course, Prince Bandar and the Saudi intelligence has been key in equipping Al-Qaeda and ISIS in Syria.
[03:18:24.397 --> 03:18:26.679]  You know, those moderate terrorists.
[03:18:26.819 --> 03:18:28.521]  You know, the good guy terrorists.
[03:18:28.641 --> 03:18:29.762]  Not the bad guy terrorists.
[03:18:29.822 --> 03:18:31.944]  You know, our terrorists are the good guys.
[03:18:32.204 --> 03:18:32.945]  They're freedom fighters.
[03:18:33.732 --> 03:18:40.862]  You know, the Mujahideen that became the Al-Qaeda, the moderate rebels who became, you know, al-Nusra and then became ISIS.
[03:18:40.902 --> 03:18:41.763]  Those are the good guys.
[03:18:41.803 --> 03:18:42.685]  Those are our guys.
[03:18:42.825 --> 03:18:47.491]  And the Saudis help us to supply them with arms and equipment.
[03:18:47.611 --> 03:18:50.135]  And especially Prince Bandar, who has been
[03:18:51.036 --> 03:18:55.598]  So closely tied to the CIA, can't tell where one starts and the other one stops.
[03:18:56.058 --> 03:19:04.482]  And when this starts going to the Saudis, it goes to Prince Bandar, and when it goes to Prince Bandar, it goes to the CIA and our dark government.
[03:19:04.522 --> 03:19:06.903]  That's why they're so concerned about this.
[03:19:08.143 --> 03:19:09.704]  But now you have...
[03:19:10.868 --> 03:19:14.669]  Lindsey Graham saying, shut up, you don't get a lawyer to the families.
[03:19:14.969 --> 03:19:17.130]  And he is being joined in this by Paul Ryan.
[03:19:17.150 --> 03:19:18.230]  We talked about this last night.
[03:19:18.250 --> 03:19:20.831]  I won't go into that again because we've got some new news.
[03:19:20.871 --> 03:19:25.933]  I want to take a look at the election because last night we didn't know how the delegate math was going to shake out.
[03:19:26.513 --> 03:19:30.014]  Donald Trump needed to get more than 50% to get a block of 14 votes.
[03:19:30.054 --> 03:19:37.737]  But then they take the rest of these, uh, rest of these, uh, delegates are allocated on a congressional basis.
[03:19:38.857 --> 03:19:40.818]  And you have to win each of these congressional districts.
[03:19:40.838 --> 03:19:45.619]  And of course the congressional districts are not based on the county lines.
[03:19:45.699 --> 03:19:47.920]  You know, they're gerrymandered in every state of the union.
[03:19:48.220 --> 03:19:49.740]  They run through multiple county lines.
[03:19:50.001 --> 03:19:52.781]  So it takes them a while to run through and figure out how this is going to go.
[03:19:52.821 --> 03:19:56.202]  And we can't trust them in terms of how they're allocating these delegates.
[03:19:56.603 --> 03:19:57.583]  Stay with us when we come back.
[03:19:57.603 --> 03:20:03.405]  We're going to take a look at the delegate math and we're also going to take a look at what's happening to our money.
[03:20:03.465 --> 03:20:07.006]  They're taking Andrew Jackson off and they're putting Harriet Tubman on.
[03:20:07.747 --> 03:20:09.913]  You know, I want to see them take the Federal Reserve.
[03:20:17.816 --> 03:20:30.842]  44,000 plus people have evacuated the Japanese town of Mashiki on the southern portion of the Land of the Rising Sun following a 7.4 magnitude earthquake that has killed at least nine and injured 858.
[03:20:31.122 --> 03:20:37.705]  If you have been paying attention, you may have noticed the frequency of earthquakes being reported in 2016 has been unyielding.
[03:20:40.026 --> 03:20:44.048]  Recently, a magnitude 6.5 earthquake hit Vanuatu.
[03:20:44.369 --> 03:20:48.011]  A magnitude 5.9 earthquake hit the southern Philippines.
[03:20:48.371 --> 03:20:51.593]  A magnitude 6.9 earthquake rocked Myanmar.
[03:20:51.813 --> 03:20:57.296]  And on April 10th, a 6.6 magnitude quake hit Kabul with aftershocks in India.
[03:20:57.456 --> 03:21:01.778]  On April 8th, there was a magnitude 4.2 earthquake in Nepal.
[03:21:02.078 --> 03:21:07.622]  Nepal was also hit earlier with a large 5.5 magnitude quake on February 22nd.
[03:21:08.582 --> 03:21:15.590]  And in the beginning of 2016, on January 20th, there was a 6.1 magnitude earthquake in China, and 16 days prior, 11 people had died when a 6.7 magnitude earthquake hit Manipur in India.
[03:21:23.499 --> 03:21:30.843]  Michael Snyder of End of the American Dream writes, Why is the crust of the Earth shaking so violently all of a sudden?
[03:21:31.223 --> 03:21:46.231]  Seismologist Ilham of the University of Colorado has made headlines all over the world by warning that current conditions might trigger at least four earthquakes greater than 8.0 in magnitude if his projections are accurate.
[03:21:46.531 --> 03:21:54.854]  Our planet could be on the precipice of a wave of natural disasters unlike anything that any of us have ever experienced before.
[03:21:55.074 --> 03:21:59.395]  Basically, what we saw in Japan earlier today is tiny.
[03:21:59.535 --> 03:22:04.257]  Compared to the destruction, Bilham has been desperately trying to compel governments
[03:22:04.657 --> 03:22:06.578]  All over the globe to be aware of.
[03:22:06.839 --> 03:22:11.862]  But Bilham has been turned away from at least one country that refused to hear the truth.
[03:22:12.182 --> 03:22:17.826]  In 2012, Indian officials deported Bilham when his plane arrived in New Delhi.
[03:22:17.846 --> 03:22:17.906]  Why?
[03:22:18.447 --> 03:22:25.832]  Bilham had raised concerns about the dangerous seismic activity in the Jaipur region where a nuclear plant was being planned.
[03:22:26.292 --> 03:22:31.755]  Meanwhile, authorities are quietly racing to monitor the many volcanoes blowing their tops.
[03:22:32.156 --> 03:22:37.479]  Currently, there are 38 active volcanoes as the Earth moves through its volcano season.
[03:22:37.639 --> 03:22:41.741]  The World Net Daily writes, there is a 5% to a 10% chance in the next 80 years, scientists say.
[03:22:44.523 --> 03:22:53.751]  One of these eruptions will kill millions of people and poison the atmosphere beyond the imagination of anything man's activity could do in a thousand years.
[03:22:54.152 --> 03:22:58.996]  And no one is yet making any plans to deal with the calamitous possibilities.
[03:23:00.257 --> 03:23:02.779]  But earthquakes are earthquakes and I don't know.
[03:23:03.280 --> 03:23:05.041]  Hopefully we just won't ever have to worry about it.
[03:23:05.421 --> 03:23:08.124]  How does that make you feel living here and running a business here?
[03:23:09.398 --> 03:23:11.241]  Um, it just feels kind of awkward.
[03:23:11.941 --> 03:23:13.303]  I didn't know about that fall.
[03:23:14.485 --> 03:23:23.215]  We've had earthquakes here in the last two or three months that weren't as big as this, but I'm just happy that I have a building that I know that can withstand it.
[03:23:25.191 --> 03:23:32.854]  Relatively unknown fault line that was here and you can see where the road has just separated into.
[03:23:32.874 --> 03:23:36.475]  It was pushed up against each other directly in this area.
[03:23:36.555 --> 03:23:40.817]  Sidewalks are about three feet high in some places.
[03:23:42.190 --> 03:23:53.813]  True to California fashion, some of the children have seen this as their opportunity to have their own makeshift bike ramps and skate ramps, trying to make the best of this situation.
[03:23:54.073 --> 03:24:03.074]  All eyes should be on the ring of fire as the trenches activate the tectonic plates at exponential levels and earthquake news events multiply.
[03:24:03.435 --> 03:24:05.275]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com.
[03:24:07.175 --> 03:24:08.636]  Oh my God, we're having an earthquake.
[03:24:08.676 --> 03:24:09.116]  Wait a minute.
[03:24:09.156 --> 03:24:09.556]  Hold on.
[03:24:09.596 --> 03:24:09.836]  Hold on.
[03:24:16.034 --> 03:24:20.817]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:20.897 --> 03:24:24.138]  I'm David Knight, your host for this fourth hour, April 20th, 2016.
[03:24:24.298 --> 03:24:26.119]  I want to get back to election news.
[03:24:26.139 --> 03:24:32.322]  We're going to talk about how as Cruz is fading, it's Hillary or bust for the New World Order.
[03:24:32.403 --> 03:24:38.226]  There's a lot of articles coming out pointing to the GOP establishment coalescing behind Hillary Clinton.
[03:24:38.266 --> 03:24:39.406]  Why would they do that?
[03:24:39.426 --> 03:24:40.487]  Well, there's a couple of reasons.
[03:24:40.507 --> 03:24:41.227]  We'll talk about that.
[03:24:41.807 --> 03:24:44.669]  Also, the revenge of the central bankers.
[03:24:45.956 --> 03:24:49.077]  They're changing the face on the $20 bill.
[03:24:49.097 --> 03:24:50.717]  We're going to talk about why they would do that.
[03:24:50.757 --> 03:24:55.579]  And actually, we're going to go back and talk a little bit about Andrew Jackson's election.
[03:24:56.139 --> 03:25:00.020]  The one that he lost, actually, because it has some interesting parallels to today.
[03:25:00.040 --> 03:25:03.381]  I stopped at the Hermitage just outside of Nashville.
[03:25:03.401 --> 03:25:05.162]  That was Andrew Jackson's home.
[03:25:05.962 --> 03:25:10.624]  So that I could do a report when I was heading back from Washington, D.C., and we talked about that election a little bit.
[03:25:10.664 --> 03:25:16.688]  But there's another point that I want to make about that election as I recap that, and it refers to delegates.
[03:25:17.108 --> 03:25:18.608]  What really are delegates?
[03:25:18.749 --> 03:25:23.671]  Before we do, I want to remind our listeners that we have Brain Force now, and this is coming to a close.
[03:25:23.691 --> 03:25:24.912]  This is the final day.
[03:25:25.672 --> 03:25:28.575]  That we're going to have the additional 25% off the sale price.
[03:25:28.615 --> 03:25:34.621]  That's 45% off the retail price for Brain Force at Infowarslife.com.
[03:25:35.302 --> 03:25:38.165]  And if you don't know about Brain Force, we've told you many times.
[03:25:38.225 --> 03:25:41.308]  Rob's talked about how it has helped him.
[03:25:41.348 --> 03:25:42.770]  I've talked about how it's my favorite.
[03:25:42.810 --> 03:25:43.270]  I think so.
[03:26:10.319 --> 03:26:15.482]  Same powerful ingredients, but with a new ingredient, but the same price.
[03:26:15.983 --> 03:26:19.845]  Ingredients in DNA Force include a patented form of the antioxidant CoQ10.
[03:26:20.285 --> 03:26:26.970]  It also has BioPQQ, just one ingredient, that costs about $30,000 per batch.
[03:26:27.030 --> 03:26:31.853]  There's 175 clinical studies that show it is extremely hard to secure.
[03:26:31.873 --> 03:26:34.755]  These clinical studies show its effectiveness.
[03:26:34.775 --> 03:26:37.236]  We also have digestive enzymes, immune boosting,
[03:26:38.357 --> 03:26:41.738]  Supplements in there, pomegranate extract, plant-based resveratrol.
[03:26:42.178 --> 03:26:47.841]  Again, we have all new DNA Force Plus is now back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[03:26:47.881 --> 03:26:50.261]  New ingredient, same price.
[03:26:50.642 --> 03:26:52.742]  Okay, now let's go back to what happened last night.
[03:26:52.762 --> 03:26:54.563]  There was a great headline on Politico.
[03:26:54.583 --> 03:26:57.184]  It says, Cruz's New York value?
[03:26:58.164 --> 03:26:59.005]  Zero delegates.
[03:26:59.325 --> 03:27:04.507]  Because, of course, he had that famous blunder at one of the debates where he talked about, yeah, I don't have
[03:27:05.424 --> 03:27:06.826]  Donald Trump's New York values.
[03:27:06.866 --> 03:27:09.389]  Well, New York doesn't value Ted Cruz.
[03:27:09.849 --> 03:27:11.671]  Look, he's not a national candidate.
[03:27:11.851 --> 03:27:15.556]  He can't even win with Southern Evangelicals, which was going to be his base.
[03:27:16.317 --> 03:27:19.821]  And he doesn't really have a chance of winning.
[03:27:20.061 --> 03:27:21.483]  If we took a look at the math now.
[03:27:23.070 --> 03:27:26.312]  The 1237 delegates that are needed, there's 734 remaining.
[03:27:26.412 --> 03:27:30.774]  Now, what does this do in terms of percentage needed as we stand right now?
[03:27:31.734 --> 03:27:39.158]  And there's still like another three delegates that need to be allocated out of New York, but Cruz is not going to get any, I don't think, because he finished like 15%.
[03:27:39.398 --> 03:27:40.999]  There's probably a threshold.
[03:27:41.619 --> 03:27:43.801]  That you have to be above in order to get any delegates.
[03:27:43.821 --> 03:27:45.142]  That's what we've seen in other states.
[03:27:45.182 --> 03:27:47.564]  So it doesn't look like Cruz is going to pick up any.
[03:27:48.465 --> 03:27:49.766]  Trump may pick up a couple.
[03:27:49.806 --> 03:27:50.927]  Kasich may pick up one.
[03:27:50.967 --> 03:27:51.387]  Who knows?
[03:27:51.467 --> 03:27:57.893]  But basically, where it stands right now, of the remaining primaries, Trump needs to get 53% of the delegates.
[03:27:57.933 --> 03:27:59.034]  Cruz needs to get 92% of the delegates.
[03:27:59.054 --> 03:28:00.335]  92% of the delegates.
[03:28:00.355 --> 03:28:02.056]  You think he can bat 920?
[03:28:02.096 --> 03:28:02.837]  I don't think so.
[03:28:10.393 --> 03:28:13.494]  Now, Kasich needs to get an impossible 149.
[03:28:13.974 --> 03:28:20.976]  It just keeps getting more and more absurd for John Kasich as that window moves along.
[03:28:21.076 --> 03:28:25.398]  So, Trump needs to get 53% to get to the magic number and then they're in.
[03:28:25.438 --> 03:28:32.180]  Now we've got the Washington Post saying an internal campaign memo projects that Trump will win 1,400 delegates at the GOP convention.
[03:28:33.325 --> 03:28:38.010]  They say the projections come in a memo that was distributed to Trump surrogates late last night.
[03:28:38.230 --> 03:28:39.872]  The Washington Post got the memo.
[03:28:39.912 --> 03:28:41.033]  Here's some of the things it says.
[03:28:41.393 --> 03:28:47.860]  Our projections call for us to accumulate over 1,400 delegates and thus a first ballot nomination win in Cleveland.
[03:28:49.101 --> 03:28:50.342]  Now that's going to be necessary.
[03:28:50.402 --> 03:28:52.004]  Why is that going to be necessary?
[03:28:53.206 --> 03:29:03.614]  Well, we'll talk about what delegates are in just a moment in terms of the election of John Q. Adams.
[03:29:03.994 --> 03:29:10.399]  John Quincy Adams, the son of John Adams, who beat Andrew Jackson the first time he ran.
[03:29:10.679 --> 03:29:15.103]  The way that he did that was it went into the House of Representatives.
[03:29:16.297 --> 03:29:20.479]  Now, there weren't really any political parties in that election, but they had four candidates.
[03:29:21.059 --> 03:29:25.742]  They had Andrew Jackson, who had the vast plurality, but not 50% plus one.
[03:29:26.522 --> 03:29:28.783]  Then you had John Quincy Adams, who was in second place.
[03:29:28.923 --> 03:29:33.505]  I forget who was in third place, but you had Henry Clay, who was the Speaker of the House, kind of like Paul Ryan.
[03:29:34.646 --> 03:29:35.666]  He was in fourth place.
[03:29:36.407 --> 03:29:38.448]  We'll tell you what happened when we come back.
[03:29:39.505 --> 03:29:40.286]  I guess you can figure.
[03:29:40.426 --> 03:29:43.688]  Henry Clay threw all of his stuff to Andrew Jackson.
[03:29:44.229 --> 03:29:47.271]  But where do these delegates in the Electoral College come from?
[03:29:47.731 --> 03:29:52.215]  Why do the GOP and the Democrats call them delegates and mirror that?
[03:29:52.835 --> 03:29:55.657]  And that will expose the lies of Ted Cruz.
[03:29:55.677 --> 03:29:56.058]  Stay with us.
[03:29:56.098 --> 03:29:56.758]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:59.841 --> 03:30:00.721]  We're on the march.
[03:30:01.242 --> 03:30:02.823]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.764 --> 03:30:06.466]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[03:30:12.446 --> 03:30:18.391]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:30:18.612 --> 03:30:32.785]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running 6 miles every other day, swimming 2-3 miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights
[03:30:33.365 --> 03:30:35.287]  They're focusing on fighting the globalists.
[03:30:35.687 --> 03:30:43.493]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds and the weight's going off even faster.
[03:30:43.713 --> 03:30:50.818]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[03:30:51.139 --> 03:30:56.863]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.

[03:32:09.110 --> 03:32:13.052]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[03:32:13.232 --> 03:32:15.493]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[03:32:15.653 --> 03:32:24.038]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[03:32:24.298 --> 03:32:27.640]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[03:32:27.780 --> 03:32:38.266]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.

[03:32:48.152 --> 03:32:55.800]  Supermail Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[03:32:56.101 --> 03:33:02.267]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[03:33:27.858 --> 03:33:32.805]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:33:36.829 --> 03:33:38.170]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:38.210 --> 03:33:38.770]  I'm David Knight.
[03:33:38.790 --> 03:33:41.771]  In this segment, we're going to talk about Andrew Jackson.
[03:33:42.231 --> 03:33:43.972]  I know he's at the top of your list of people.
[03:33:44.112 --> 03:33:48.094]  Actually, he's in the news now because they're going to remove him from the currency.
[03:33:48.254 --> 03:33:53.216]  There's this big kerfuffle about whose picture is going to be on which bills.
[03:33:53.296 --> 03:33:55.277]  First they were going to take off Alexander Hamilton.
[03:33:55.317 --> 03:33:59.299]  Now they're going to take off Andrew Jackson and they're going to put on Harriet Tubman.
[03:33:59.599 --> 03:34:00.840]  We'll talk about that in a moment.
[03:34:01.440 --> 03:34:06.481]  Quite frankly, I don't really care what figurehead they put on the dollar bills.
[03:34:06.621 --> 03:34:09.282]  I want to get the Federal Reserve out of our money.
[03:34:09.902 --> 03:34:10.162]  Okay?
[03:34:10.543 --> 03:34:12.403]  And then you can put whoever you want to.
[03:34:12.663 --> 03:34:17.684]  I mean, you can put Caitlyn Jenner on it if it's genuine currency and I don't care.
[03:34:17.704 --> 03:34:18.325]  Okay?
[03:34:18.665 --> 03:34:21.285]  But let's talk about the election aspect of Andrew Jackson.
[03:34:21.305 --> 03:34:22.846]  We've got a great article there showing right there.
[03:34:23.426 --> 03:34:28.669]  A great article that's up on Infowars.com that gives a history of what we're going to talk about here in just a moment.
[03:34:28.729 --> 03:34:32.891]  Jackson narrowly succeeded in staving off banker domination of the U.S.
[03:34:33.211 --> 03:34:35.512]  during his day, and that lasted for many decades.
[03:34:35.672 --> 03:34:48.818]  We're going to talk a little bit about that history because when you look at the people that the Federal Reserve chose to put on the currency, it tells an interesting story about our political narrative, the narrative that the elites like to promote.
[03:34:49.718 --> 03:34:50.979]  Let's talk about his election first.
[03:34:51.039 --> 03:34:52.860]  As I just pointed out in the last segment,
[03:34:54.261 --> 03:35:04.834]  When it went into the House of Representatives, and it did go into the House of Representatives, you have four candidates who are running, nobody had a clear majority, so they go into the House of Representatives with their electoral college delegates.
[03:35:06.107 --> 03:35:06.607]  Delegates.
[03:35:07.247 --> 03:35:08.488]  What were these people there for?
[03:35:08.608 --> 03:35:11.128]  Well, you had Andrew Jackson, who was a little bit less than 50%.
[03:35:12.149 --> 03:35:13.649]  John Quincy Adams in second place.
[03:35:13.769 --> 03:35:16.530]  Henry Clay, the Speaker of the House, in fourth place.
[03:35:16.690 --> 03:35:19.291]  Clay gave his delegates to John Quincy Adams.
[03:35:19.311 --> 03:35:23.232]  That put him over the 50% point and made him President.
[03:35:23.532 --> 03:35:27.253]  And Andrew Jackson lost, even though he had a lot more of the popular vote.
[03:35:27.593 --> 03:35:30.254]  Now, who did these delegates belong to when they went to Electoral College?
[03:35:31.414 --> 03:35:34.055]  Andrew Jackson's delegates were loyal to him.
[03:35:35.049 --> 03:35:38.577]  And John Quincy Adams were loyal to him, and Henry Clay's were loyal to him.
[03:35:38.597 --> 03:35:40.441]  That's why he could give them to John Quincy Adams.
[03:35:41.002 --> 03:35:41.263]  Okay?
[03:35:41.884 --> 03:35:44.269]  That was your brokered convention, the way that it worked there.
[03:35:45.734 --> 03:36:07.591]  When you look at the Electoral College today, and we won't get into a lot of detail as to what its real purpose was, but just to say this, back in the day when I worked for the Libertarian Party in North Carolina, I was on the slate of Electoral College delegates, so that if the Libertarian Party candidate had won in North Carolina, I would have gone to the Electoral College, and I would have cast my vote
[03:36:08.331 --> 03:36:14.057]  For the Libertarian candidate in that election there, okay, in the Electoral College.
[03:36:14.637 --> 03:36:20.783]  Now, the Republicans had to produce their slate of delegates, and the Democrats had their slate of delegates.
[03:36:20.803 --> 03:36:26.389]  So, if North Carolina, I don't remember what the number is, 12, 15 is the number of congressional districts, or maybe it's 12.
[03:36:28.106 --> 03:36:40.798]  If they had 12 Electoral College delegates, then there would be a slate of 12 Republicans, a slate of 12 Democrats, a slate of 12 Libertarians, and then whoever won that election would send their delegates to the Electoral College.
[03:36:41.359 --> 03:36:45.823]  Why doesn't it work that way with the GOP and the Democrats?
[03:36:46.704 --> 03:36:51.168]  You see, what Ted Cruz is doing right now is you're voting
[03:36:52.059 --> 03:36:52.639]  Four people.
[03:36:52.659 --> 03:36:54.160]  They call them Trump Delegates.
[03:36:54.560 --> 03:36:56.582]  Who do Trump's Delegates belong to?
[03:36:56.662 --> 03:36:59.423]  Why doesn't Donald Trump get to pick his Delegates?
[03:36:59.463 --> 03:37:04.006]  Why is it that he'd go into a place like South Carolina where he won every single Delegate?
[03:37:04.106 --> 03:37:06.127]  Every single Delegate in South Carolina.
[03:37:06.907 --> 03:37:07.928]  And I don't remember what they had.
[03:37:07.968 --> 03:37:08.648]  What was it?
[03:37:08.668 --> 03:37:09.409]  50-something, I think.
[03:37:10.009 --> 03:37:11.410]  So they got 50 Delegates, let's say.
[03:37:13.038 --> 03:37:21.450]  Why don't they come to the Trump people and say, Donald Trump campaign, who are your delegates that you want to send to the GOP convention?
[03:37:21.511 --> 03:37:23.153]  People that are going to be loyal to you.
[03:37:23.193 --> 03:37:24.916]  And he would send them a list of 50 names.
[03:37:26.035 --> 03:37:27.196]  Doesn't work that way, does it?
[03:37:27.316 --> 03:37:36.463]  Instead, what they do is they go to the local party, and the local party comes up with a list of delegates who are loyal to a different candidate than the voters voted for.
[03:37:36.684 --> 03:37:38.385]  They called them Donald Trump's delegates.
[03:37:38.745 --> 03:37:40.467]  It doesn't work like the Electoral College.
[03:37:40.487 --> 03:37:42.428]  You think it works like the Electoral College.
[03:37:42.808 --> 03:37:48.333]  You think that you're going to vote for somebody, these delegates are going to be awarded to that party's candidate or that particular candidate.
[03:37:48.373 --> 03:37:51.756]  They even call them that candidate's delegates, but then they send somebody else.
[03:37:52.216 --> 03:37:54.017]  That's the fundamental lie
[03:37:54.938 --> 03:37:57.039]  That Ted Cruz cannot escape.
[03:37:58.040 --> 03:38:02.923]  The fact that he is substituting this, the fact the Republican Party is substituting this, don't call them delegates.
[03:38:03.863 --> 03:38:09.266]  Come up with a different name because you're trying to hoodwink people by comparing it to the Electoral College.
[03:38:10.027 --> 03:38:10.747]  They're not delegates.
[03:38:10.787 --> 03:38:24.115]  This is not politics where you go in and try to convince these people in a second secret election that they worked very hard to try to conceal from the public is even happening, that they try to make sure that the wrong people don't go to, as we had
[03:38:24.855 --> 03:38:35.024]  The interviews that Rob Dew and Crew did with people in Colorado, they said, yeah, I was told by the GOP establishment they wanted to make sure that the wrong people didn't show up at this election process.
[03:38:35.064 --> 03:38:36.325]  So they kind of kept it secret.
[03:38:36.846 --> 03:38:41.610]  Make sure the right people voted in this little tiny non-election.
[03:38:42.391 --> 03:38:43.312]  That's the fraud.
[03:38:43.952 --> 03:38:45.173]  That's what you can't escape.
[03:38:46.174 --> 03:38:48.977]  Now the interesting thing is, is that as Ted Cruz is fading,
[03:38:50.037 --> 03:38:53.000]  It really is Hillary or bust for the New World Order.
[03:38:53.580 --> 03:38:55.722]  We have a story up on Infowars.com by Kurt Nemo.
[03:38:55.742 --> 03:39:02.388]  Top neocon Bill Kristol respects the Cruz campaign for its brazen theft of delegates and its backroom politics.
[03:39:02.408 --> 03:39:03.068]  Isn't that great?
[03:39:03.088 --> 03:39:03.969]  Isn't that great?
[03:39:04.249 --> 03:39:06.411]  You know, if you're a lawyer, you just love it.
[03:39:06.451 --> 03:39:07.752]  You know, winning is everything.
[03:39:07.792 --> 03:39:09.113]  It doesn't matter how you do it.
[03:39:09.574 --> 03:39:13.757]  You got what laws you got to break, whether it's ethical, whether it's legal, whatever.
[03:39:13.817 --> 03:39:16.059]  I mean, just do what you can, man, as long as you don't get caught, right?
[03:39:16.900 --> 03:39:29.375]  That's the ethics of these lawyers, people like Bill Kristol, who is the editor, as Kurt Nemo points out, of the Neocon readout, you know, the Castle, the weekly standard.
[03:39:29.495 --> 03:39:31.337]  And that is spelled, by the way, W-E-A-K.
[03:39:32.739 --> 03:39:33.740]  Okay, weekly standard.
[03:39:33.760 --> 03:39:34.862]  That's the correct spelling of that.
[03:39:34.982 --> 03:39:37.324]  It's usually misspelled when you see it.
[03:39:37.585 --> 03:39:39.987]  They even misspell it themselves on their own website.
[03:39:40.107 --> 03:39:49.158]  They spell it like the week, you know, W-E-E-K, but no, it actually is W-E-A-K, because it is very weekly standard neocon fair that they're putting out there.
[03:39:49.758 --> 03:39:51.420]  And I say, crystal circulated memo.
[03:39:52.478 --> 03:39:54.920]  He's one of the founders of the Never Trump movement.
[03:39:55.421 --> 03:40:05.650]  He urged the party to back establishment-vetted candidates like former presidential loser Rick Perry, or Tom Coburn, the former Oklahoma senator.
[03:40:05.670 --> 03:40:08.032]  We'll tell you more about Tom Coburn here in just a moment.
[03:40:08.092 --> 03:40:11.475]  He's in some other news about a constitutional convention in Oklahoma.
[03:40:12.116 --> 03:40:20.818]  But anyway, it goes on to say in the article, Crystal's neocon comrades believe that a Clinton presidency would be preferable to a Trump one.
[03:40:21.339 --> 03:40:29.121]  People like Max Boot, Robert Kagan, Eliot Cohen, and as Kurt Nemo points out, the Prince of Darkness himself, Richard Perle,
[03:40:29.881 --> 03:40:40.228]  All believe a Clinton presidency will continue the neocon foreign policy agenda resulting in the longest war in American history, Afghanistan, and the invasion of Iraq that cost over a million Iraqi lives.
[03:40:40.988 --> 03:40:46.952]  And Kagan wrote for the Washington Post, Robert Kagan said, the only choice will be to vote for Hillary.
[03:40:47.878 --> 03:40:50.340]  The party cannot be saved, but the country still can be.
[03:40:50.400 --> 03:40:51.201]  No, no, no.
[03:40:51.281 --> 03:40:52.682]  It's not the country he's trying to save.
[03:40:53.482 --> 03:40:58.546]  Really, this is what Robert Kagan and the neocon globalists are saying.
[03:40:58.906 --> 03:41:13.597]  People like all these CFR people, all these neocons, and it was in December the National Review was saying, boy, we're really offended that Ted Cruz is calling Max Boot and Robert Kagan and Elliott Cohen and Richard Perle, he's calling all these people
[03:41:14.418 --> 03:41:15.239]  Neocons!
[03:41:15.299 --> 03:41:16.581]  That's a pejorative term.
[03:41:16.601 --> 03:41:19.705]  That's a dog whistle to his conservative libertarian base.
[03:41:20.426 --> 03:41:22.128]  You're accusing us of being warmongers.
[03:41:22.208 --> 03:41:25.553]  It's like, yeah, yeah, if it fits, wear it, but...
[03:41:26.789 --> 03:41:30.530]  He now has these people as his close foreign policy advisors.
[03:41:30.810 --> 03:41:31.791]  The mask has come off.
[03:41:32.291 --> 03:41:40.214]  Ted Cruz is no longer going around using the dog whistle to get his conservative base fooled and falling in line behind him.
[03:41:40.314 --> 03:41:44.035]  Instead, what he is doing is he's using these people as his advisors.
[03:41:44.055 --> 03:41:52.118]  And when they say the party cannot be saved, but the country still can be, no, what they're saying is the party can't be saved, but the new world order agenda still can be.
[03:41:52.298 --> 03:41:53.338]  That's what's really important to them.
[03:41:53.358 --> 03:41:55.319]  When you look at how many times they've tried to push through
[03:41:55.959 --> 03:42:03.642]  This Keystone Pipeline and its imminent domain grab, land grab, for this foreign Canadian corporation.
[03:42:04.542 --> 03:42:06.863]  They have run this thing through like 11 times.
[03:42:07.423 --> 03:42:20.847]  After the Republicans were elected again and had their majority, the first thing they did was to send up the Keystone Pipeline bill again to Barack Obama, knowing that he would not sign it.
[03:42:21.107 --> 03:42:21.468]  Okay?
[03:42:21.528 --> 03:42:22.248]  What do you call it?
[03:42:23.140 --> 03:42:27.023]  When you keep doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result?
[03:42:27.703 --> 03:42:29.244]  Well, some people call it insanity.
[03:42:29.264 --> 03:42:31.486]  I call it obedience.
[03:42:32.426 --> 03:42:38.710]  See, they want to be obedient to their corporate masters, and they continue to do this to continue to show just how obedient they are.
[03:42:38.730 --> 03:42:42.573]  And of course, Hillary Clinton's State Department supported that Keystone Pipeline.
[03:42:42.973 --> 03:42:47.036]  So that's why you look at this on all these different issues, they fall in line.
[03:42:47.076 --> 03:42:52.480]  Let me play for you Rafael Cruz, father of Rafael Cruz Jr.
[03:42:53.641 --> 03:42:55.165]  Also known as the TED.
[03:42:55.926 --> 03:43:00.918]  Let me tell you what Rafael Cruz, let's play this, what he said about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
[03:43:02.927 --> 03:43:05.948]  These are people that like your son, like Ted Cruz.
[03:43:06.048 --> 03:43:07.109]  They like what he stands for.
[03:43:07.589 --> 03:43:11.391]  In fact, many of them said, hey, I would be a supporter of Ted Cruz, except for the following.
[03:43:12.051 --> 03:43:26.257]  I think, and what they're saying is, if I can paraphrase, they believe that Donald Trump, in a little bit because of not just his policies, but just the way he rolls, has got a better shot of taking on the Clinton apparatus than your son.
[03:43:26.317 --> 03:43:28.858]  What would you say to those people today as they go to the polls in New York?
[03:43:29.198 --> 03:43:30.379]  What would you tell them to think about?
[03:43:31.551 --> 03:43:32.912]  It's very simple, Steve.
[03:43:33.112 --> 03:43:34.852]  All they have to do is look at the polls.
[03:43:35.232 --> 03:43:45.196]  Poll after poll after poll after poll shows that if Donald Trump is a Republican nominee, he loses to Hillary Clinton by double digits.
[03:43:45.596 --> 03:43:48.557]  Donald Trump cannot beat Hillary Clinton.
[03:43:49.578 --> 03:43:59.121]  That would be the dream ticket for Hillary Clinton because all the polls show that Donald Trump will lose and will lose by a landslide to Hillary Clinton.
[03:43:59.716 --> 03:44:04.943]  He is, his disapproval rate is in the high 60s.
[03:44:05.564 --> 03:44:08.088]  Two-thirds of Americans don't want Donald Trump.
[03:44:08.188 --> 03:44:10.851]  Donald Trump cannot win in the general election.
[03:44:11.352 --> 03:44:16.259]  We've got to realize, Donald Trump really is more of a Democrat than a Republican.
[03:44:16.849 --> 03:44:22.658]  He has been funding Democratic people like Chuck Schumer.
[03:44:31.257 --> 03:44:35.981]  He's behind an incumbent president, at this point he was, by 15 points!
[03:44:36.601 --> 03:44:37.582]  Ronald Reagan can't win.
[03:44:37.902 --> 03:44:40.945]  And Ronald Reagan is more of a Democrat than he is a Republican.
[03:44:40.965 --> 03:44:43.167]  This guy was president of a union.
[03:44:43.647 --> 03:44:47.850]  He was a lifelong Democrat until he became a Republican governor.
[03:44:47.870 --> 03:44:49.051]  But, you know, that's in California.
[03:44:49.171 --> 03:44:50.512]  It doesn't count, you know.
[03:44:50.593 --> 03:44:51.834]  It's like California values.
[03:44:51.854 --> 03:44:53.495]  You know, like Donald Trump's got New York values.
[03:44:53.575 --> 03:44:56.277]  Look, they don't want to talk about the issues.
[03:44:56.377 --> 03:45:00.420]  And I would advise people, as I'm listening to Rafael Cruz talk,
[03:45:01.394 --> 03:45:18.079]  Go back and look at that article, look at the interview that Alex Jones had with Wayne Madsen exposing the connections of Ted Cruz's father to the CIA in Cuba around the time of the Cuban Revolution, okay?
[03:45:18.639 --> 03:45:19.740]  Ask yourself how he got here.
[03:45:20.080 --> 03:45:29.443]  Why do we keep getting these people with ties to the CFR, with big banks, to the CIA, and not citizens like Barack Obama and Ted Cruz?
[03:45:29.483 --> 03:45:31.004]  He is not eligible, folks.
[03:45:31.384 --> 03:45:32.665]  That's the bottom line.
[03:45:32.705 --> 03:45:34.585]  He is not a natural-born citizen.
[03:45:34.845 --> 03:45:35.546]  I would love...
[03:45:36.328 --> 03:45:38.110]  To have an interview with Ted Cruz.
[03:45:38.650 --> 03:45:40.813]  I would not be asking him about the elections.
[03:45:41.393 --> 03:45:44.276]  I was glad that Sean Hannity called him on the BS.
[03:45:44.817 --> 03:45:47.159]  I would call him on the BS of his eligibility.
[03:45:47.760 --> 03:45:53.926]  And we would have that discussion because he likes to throw that out there and use that as a smokescreen, okay?
[03:45:54.246 --> 03:45:58.531]  Now, in a sister article that's up on the Drudge Report as well,
[03:45:59.741 --> 03:46:05.323]  Vanity Fair asks why, or answers I should say, why Democrats are becoming the party of the 1%.
[03:46:06.084 --> 03:46:11.446]  They say in a world of Trumpism and Clintonism, there's only one place for the globalist minded elites to go.
[03:46:11.466 --> 03:46:13.627]  And that's Hillary Clinton, folks.
[03:46:14.427 --> 03:46:22.271]  Because as Donald Trump is running them out of the Republican Party, they say, sure, many rich people hate Obamacare, but how big a deal is it?
[03:46:22.881 --> 03:46:24.402]  Compared to the other things that they want.
[03:46:24.562 --> 03:46:28.104]  Because, you know, Obamacare, that was on the Christmas list four years ago.
[03:46:28.124 --> 03:46:35.568]  That's where we had Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, because either one of them were going to give them what the globalist agenda wanted, and that was Obamacare.
[03:46:35.648 --> 03:46:38.890]  They wanted control, central control of our health care.
[03:46:39.450 --> 03:46:43.173]  They say, but now what they want more is more immigration.
[03:46:44.053 --> 03:46:46.474]  Sustained and expanding trade.
[03:46:46.594 --> 03:46:48.655]  Continued defense commitments.
[03:46:48.715 --> 03:46:50.336]  Now let's unpack those, okay?
[03:46:50.816 --> 03:46:51.516]  More immigration.
[03:46:51.556 --> 03:46:52.857]  They want open borders, folks.
[03:46:53.277 --> 03:46:54.597]  Sustained and expanding trade.
[03:46:54.637 --> 03:46:58.199]  They want foreign control of our economy.
[03:46:58.639 --> 03:46:59.959]  We're not talking about free trade.
[03:47:00.320 --> 03:47:01.820]  Free trade is very easy to do.
[03:47:02.220 --> 03:47:03.961]  You don't need thousands of pages.
[03:47:03.981 --> 03:47:07.563]  You don't need an organization that operates offshore, okay?
[03:47:08.843 --> 03:47:09.724]  Defense commitments?
[03:47:10.205 --> 03:47:13.789]  Okay, these are triggers that are set up to keep us in perpetual war.
[03:47:14.049 --> 03:47:23.020]  They say the more that Trumpism scares more people that Trumpism scares away from the Republican Party, the broader and more powerful the liberal left coalition will be.
[03:47:23.040 --> 03:47:24.282]  Well, will it?
[03:47:24.722 --> 03:47:24.942]  No.
[03:47:25.383 --> 03:47:28.826]  Nobody offers their support without expecting something in return.
[03:47:28.886 --> 03:47:35.713]  So as they move to the Democrat Party, you see Chuck Schumer waffling on the carried interest tax loophole.
[03:47:35.753 --> 03:47:39.577]  You see Hillary Clinton going along with the H-1B visas.
[03:47:39.597 --> 03:47:46.844]  You see Maria Cantwell rallying support for the Export-Import Bank, and that's because they're giving them what they want.
[03:47:47.344 --> 03:47:54.549]  And as we look forward to what's happening in Indiana, where Ted Cruz is already getting his loyalists lined up, regardless of what people do there.
[03:47:54.609 --> 03:47:56.751]  But it's something, still the vote will still matter.
[03:47:56.771 --> 03:48:06.358]  You know, they're going to shave things at the ballot boxes, they're going to flip delegates, but you can show up in large enough numbers that you can still push this thing over the top.
[03:48:06.718 --> 03:48:07.698]  I think it's very telling.
[03:48:08.629 --> 03:48:18.571]  But a couple months ago, Donald Trump was the only candidate talking about the fact that Carrier was shutting down their manufacturing plant in Indianapolis and sending 1,400 workers jobs down to Mexico.
[03:48:19.611 --> 03:48:23.492]  And interestingly enough, as the campaigns start to move into Indiana, guess what's going to happen?
[03:48:23.532 --> 03:48:30.614]  Donald Trump is expected to meet with the employees of Carrier, which recently announced its plans to close its facility and move it to Mexico.
[03:48:31.174 --> 03:48:32.954]  What is Ted Cruz going to do?
[03:48:33.054 --> 03:48:35.775]  He's going to go to the Indiana GOP spring dinner.
[03:48:37.042 --> 03:48:40.846]  He is going to meet with Indiana's GOP elite.
[03:48:41.586 --> 03:48:53.638]  You know, because as I pointed out once before when we talked about what he was doing when everybody was marching for open carry at the Alamo, you had Ted Cruz playing Mrs. Nesbitt with the Tea Party ladies, okay, across the street at the Hyatt.
[03:48:54.238 --> 03:49:00.820]  Didn't bother to wave out of the window, didn't show up to speak, didn't stand with those people who are standing for their constitutional Second Amendment rights.
[03:49:00.900 --> 03:49:06.422]  No, he is always seeking influence and money from the GOP establishment.
[03:49:07.342 --> 03:49:11.484]  Oiling his way across the floor, shaking hands with the elite.
[03:49:11.984 --> 03:49:14.525]  That is Rafael Cruz Jr.
[03:49:15.385 --> 03:49:18.286]  Now, let's get to the news about our money.
[03:49:19.486 --> 03:49:22.068]  We've got one more segment and a little bit more time in this segment.
[03:49:22.849 --> 03:49:27.272]  Ben Carson defends Andrew Jackson and calls for another way to honor Harriet Tubman.
[03:49:27.852 --> 03:49:32.556]  He's criticized the decision to replace former President Andrew Jackson with Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill.
[03:49:33.156 --> 03:49:34.858]  He says Jackson was a tremendous president.
[03:49:34.878 --> 03:49:38.881]  Well, I personally would not go that far to say that Jackson was a tremendous president.
[03:49:38.921 --> 03:49:40.102]  He did a lot of really good things.
[03:49:40.162 --> 03:49:41.102]  I'm going to talk about that.
[03:49:41.883 --> 03:49:53.811]  Key to what he did right was his fight with the Federal Reserve and his fight with the Supreme Court that involved those issues and what he said about Supreme Court decisions about the division of power and so forth and so on.
[03:49:54.472 --> 03:49:58.735]  But he did have his faults and we should not gloss over the faults of anybody.
[03:49:58.755 --> 03:50:00.636]  We shouldn't be doing hagiographies of people.
[03:50:00.656 --> 03:50:02.417]  When they did something wrong we ought to call them on it.
[03:50:02.478 --> 03:50:04.039]  What he did to the Cherokee Nation
[03:50:04.759 --> 03:50:06.240]  Was horrendous, okay?
[03:50:06.461 --> 03:50:11.345]  We don't need to make any excuses for Andrew Jackson and the Cherokee Nation.
[03:50:11.465 --> 03:50:15.248]  Just like we don't need to make any excuses for the founders when it comes to slavery.
[03:50:15.288 --> 03:50:20.733]  We can say that it was wrong and we can, you know, spit out the bones and eat the chicken is what we need to do.
[03:50:20.753 --> 03:50:23.936]  And that's what we have to do in the real world because nobody is perfect.
[03:50:24.216 --> 03:50:25.016]  But I want to take a look
[03:50:25.837 --> 03:50:32.201]  At the war, the bank war, as it's called in history, that Andrew Jackson had, what was behind that?
[03:50:32.642 --> 03:50:35.063]  But let's first look at who's on these dollar bills and why.
[03:50:35.444 --> 03:50:41.308]  If you think about it, what are they telling us with the people that they put on our money, this private corporation, the Federal Reserve?
[03:50:42.128 --> 03:50:43.990]  Well, we've got currency figureheads.
[03:50:44.010 --> 03:50:49.794]  These are people who are significant federal government figures, mostly from the Revolutionary War, the Civil War.
[03:50:49.854 --> 03:50:52.696]  They also, many of them, have some bank connections.
[03:50:53.416 --> 03:51:02.618]  When we come back, we're going to talk about that, and we're going to talk about Andrew Jackson's war against the Central Bank, and what it tells us today.
[03:51:02.658 --> 03:51:03.258]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:10.319 --> 03:51:11.360]  Brain Force is here.
[03:51:11.880 --> 03:51:14.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:51:14.420 --> 03:51:22.242]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[03:51:23.018 --> 03:51:26.200]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[03:51:26.481 --> 03:51:26.601]  Right?
[03:51:26.621 --> 03:51:28.963]  You're gonna crash and you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[03:51:29.323 --> 03:51:32.846]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[03:51:32.886 --> 03:51:36.028]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[03:51:36.528 --> 03:51:41.332]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[03:51:41.873 --> 03:51:43.714]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[03:51:44.054 --> 03:51:48.498]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[03:51:48.638 --> 03:51:50.659]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[03:51:51.260 --> 03:51:52.741]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.

[03:51:53.141 --> 03:51:56.925]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.

[03:53:18.966 --> 03:53:27.096]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:53:27.356 --> 03:53:32.059]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:53:32.239 --> 03:53:38.943]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:53:39.023 --> 03:53:46.067]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:53:46.187 --> 03:53:48.008]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[03:53:48.108 --> 03:53:53.049]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:53:53.229 --> 03:53:57.571]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[03:54:17.526 --> 03:54:18.747]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:18.767 --> 03:54:22.691]  We're going to take a look at the people on our money here, because they're about to change one of them.
[03:54:23.172 --> 03:54:31.981]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to let you know that we've extended for one final day the additional 25% off the sale price of Brain Force at Infowarslife.com.
[03:54:32.021 --> 03:54:33.262]  It is now 45% off retail price.
[03:54:33.282 --> 03:54:34.823]  That is Brain Force at 45% off retail.

[03:54:45.373 --> 03:54:48.937]  Go online, look at the hundreds of five-star reviews about Brain Force.
[03:54:49.557 --> 03:54:50.178]  See for yourself.
[03:54:50.238 --> 03:54:52.780]  I've talked many times about how much it helps me.
[03:54:53.641 --> 03:55:10.611]  Now, as we look at the move that was announced today to remove Andrew Jackson off the $20 bill to put Harriet Tubman on, it's kind of interesting because when we look at the figureheads that they've put on our money, most of these people have strong ties to the federal government, to the central bank fights that we've had over the centuries.
[03:55:11.671 --> 03:55:17.515]  Most of them were usually Revolutionary War, Civil War figures, presidents, that sort of thing.
[03:55:17.875 --> 03:55:21.017]  And when we look at Harriet Tubman, she was known for running the Underground Railroad.
[03:55:22.162 --> 03:55:33.468]  Now the only thing I can think of is that maybe it's because we're being railroaded by an underground government that is putting us into slavery, not away from slavery.
[03:55:33.488 --> 03:55:37.710]  So maybe it is a fitting person to put on there for the 21st century.
[03:55:37.730 --> 03:55:43.193]  But let's look at some of the people that are on there, perhaps why they were chosen by the private Federal Reserve.
[03:55:44.090 --> 03:55:44.870]  The $1 bill.
[03:55:45.411 --> 03:55:54.255]  We have Washington, of course, the first president, the commander-in-chief of the Army, then the first president of the nation, and of course we spoke to him last night on InfoWars.com.
[03:55:54.575 --> 03:56:01.959]  You should see what George Washington had to say on April the 19th, 2016, as he came forward from the past last night.
[03:56:02.699 --> 03:56:06.501]  We have on the $5 bill, we have Abraham Lincoln, who's arguably the founder of America 2.0.
[03:56:08.464 --> 03:56:11.467]  When the American Republic was radically, radically altered.
[03:56:11.527 --> 03:56:15.851]  It was no longer the United States of America are, but the United States of America is.
[03:56:15.931 --> 03:56:24.539]  The consolidation of America into a centralized government which was antithetical to the principles that our founders wanted.
[03:56:24.679 --> 03:56:31.345]  Nevertheless, he also had a connection to the money because he issued greenbacks to finance the Civil War.
[03:56:31.886 --> 03:56:35.028]  You know, there was no central bank at that time because of Andrew Jackson.
[03:56:35.309 --> 03:56:40.973]  The bankers wanted 24 to 36 percent loans, kind of like a credit card loan today.
[03:56:40.993 --> 03:56:45.957]  You know, loan sharking, that used to be illegal, that used to be called usury, still should be called usury.
[03:56:46.397 --> 03:56:50.200]  But they wanted 24 to 36 percent on money that they would loan Lincoln for his war.
[03:56:51.570 --> 03:56:54.092]  So he issued greenbacks that were unbacked by gold and silver.
[03:56:54.112 --> 03:56:54.913]  He had an interesting quote.
[03:56:54.933 --> 03:57:04.342]  He said, if you're going to put a legend on the greenbacks, Lincoln said, I would suggest that of Peter and Paul, who said, silver and gold I have none, but such as I have, I give to thee.
[03:57:05.062 --> 03:57:08.125]  Made no bones about the fact that it was a fiat currency.
[03:57:08.405 --> 03:57:10.067]  Then we have Hamilton on the $10 bill.
[03:57:10.107 --> 03:57:12.129]  He was going to be the guy they were going to replace with a woman.
[03:57:13.345 --> 03:57:13.585]  Why?
[03:57:13.625 --> 03:57:15.566]  Because he was champion of central government.
[03:57:15.646 --> 03:57:20.008]  Of all the founders, he wanted the most control of the central government that the rest of them feared.
[03:57:20.048 --> 03:57:21.389]  He was the first Treasury Secretary.
[03:57:21.429 --> 03:57:22.730]  He was founder of the Federalist Party.
[03:57:23.290 --> 03:57:25.871]  And the champion, of course, of the National Central Bank.
[03:57:26.312 --> 03:57:30.694]  We were spared from my President Hamilton by Aaron Burr, who killed him in a duel.
[03:57:30.714 --> 03:57:33.936]  And of course, he was an ancestor of our current senator from North Carolina, Richard Burr.
[03:57:33.956 --> 03:57:38.058]  It's about the only good thing I can think of, Richard Burr, is that his ancestor shot.
[03:57:38.678 --> 03:57:39.499]  Alexander Hamilton.
[03:57:39.579 --> 03:57:48.664]  Hamilton was spared, however, from being taken off of the dollar, and I think it's mainly because of this new play that's being done on Broadway.
[03:57:48.704 --> 03:57:51.986]  They have revitalized him, okay?
[03:57:52.046 --> 03:57:54.868]  The show that's now on the Broadway musical, Hamilton.
[03:57:55.308 --> 03:58:00.611]  The New Yorkers call the show, quote, an achievement of historical and cultural reimagining.
[03:58:00.851 --> 03:58:05.453]  Yes, because the star, Miranda, has noted, we're telling a story of old, dead white men.
[03:58:05.853 --> 03:58:11.536]  But we're using actors of color, and that makes the story more immediate, more accessible to the contemporary audience.
[03:58:11.776 --> 03:58:12.017]  Okay?
[03:58:12.057 --> 03:58:20.501]  And they insist that the Founding Fathers be played by people of color, non-white, and by women who play the Founding Fathers.
[03:58:21.829 --> 03:58:22.410]  That's where we are.
[03:58:22.470 --> 03:58:24.611]  So Hamilton is now a cool black man.
[03:58:24.691 --> 03:58:27.133]  He is transracial, so he can stay on the currency.
[03:58:28.214 --> 03:58:33.199]  Andrew Jackson, however, shut down the second central bank.
[03:58:33.419 --> 03:58:34.019]  He fought them.
[03:58:34.500 --> 03:58:36.581]  He did not allow them to renew the charter.
[03:58:36.822 --> 03:58:43.147]  I think they put his picture on there as some schadenfreude, and now they're gonna take it off.
[03:58:43.487 --> 03:58:45.409]  I had a lot more to tell you about Andrew Jackson.
[03:58:45.429 --> 03:58:49.313]  Sorry I didn't get to it in the second segment.
[03:58:49.393 --> 03:58:50.954]  But join us tonight, 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:50.994 --> 03:58:51.254]  Eastern.
