[00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:21.454]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:22.174]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:23.775]  It's Monday, February 29th, 2016.
[00:00:24.136 --> 00:00:26.657]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:31.099]  Tonight.
[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.740]  Demand a plan.
[00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:34.241]  Right now.
[00:00:34.942 --> 00:00:35.362]  Right now.
[00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:36.202]  You!
[00:00:36.723 --> 00:00:37.263]  Demand it!
[00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:37.843]  Enough.
[00:00:38.244 --> 00:00:38.524]  Enough.
[00:00:39.084 --> 00:00:39.384]  Enough.
[00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:40.265]  Enough.
[00:00:41.127 --> 00:00:49.577]  Hollywood elites who push measures that would make it more difficult for Americans to own firearms walk red carpets patrolled by SWAT teams.
[00:00:50.318 --> 00:00:54.844]  Then, a bus gets struck by a Google, quote, smart car.
[00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:58.769]  And Senator Jeff Sessions endorses Donald Trump.
[00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:00.431]  That's next.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.262]  There's seven and a half billion people on this planet.
[00:01:03.282 --> 00:01:04.263]  We're all in this together.
[00:01:04.503 --> 00:01:09.929]  And as soon as we figure out that we all want prosperity and security and a future and sovereignty.
[00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.511]  You're calling for men to return.
[00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:13.612]  I noticed that from her as well.
[00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:14.934]  Women want men.
[00:01:15.374 --> 00:01:16.835]  And men want women.
[00:01:16.856 --> 00:01:18.357]  They want us all fighting with each other.
[00:01:18.637 --> 00:01:19.879]  All this fake feminism.
[00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:20.799]  It's just garbage.
[00:01:30.467 --> 00:01:37.249]  Until Monday at midnight, you can get 30% off everything at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:02:03.416 --> 00:02:04.316]  But where do you get it?
[00:02:04.616 --> 00:02:10.379]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.322]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.

[00:03:03.925 --> 00:03:07.248]  What was a big weekend for Donald Trump in terms of endorsements.
[00:03:07.288 --> 00:03:22.842]  Not only did former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer endorse Donald Trump, and of course she's known to many people as a champion of controlling immigration, illegal immigration, but also he was endorsed by Senator Jeff Sessions, as Matt Drudge called him, the conservative soul of the U.S.
[00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:23.283]  Senate.
[00:03:23.803 --> 00:03:30.508]  It was also a big blow for Ted Cruz, who has appealed to Senator Sessions in many cases.
[00:03:30.588 --> 00:03:38.654]  Actually, Senator Sessions defended him on saying that the bill that he put in was actually a poison pill and not that he had flip-flopped on immigration.
[00:03:38.674 --> 00:03:43.438]  So it was a big deal that Senator Sessions threw his support behind Donald Trump.
[00:03:43.458 --> 00:03:47.501]  It was the first time that Senator Sessions has ever endorsed a presidential candidate.
[00:03:48.021 --> 00:03:52.785]  And I want to play this video for you, going back a couple of years from Senator Sessions, to give you an idea
[00:03:53.425 --> 00:03:54.985]  Of the core of the man.
[00:03:55.185 --> 00:03:59.486]  This was a back-and-forth with Leon Panetta, who at the time was Defense Secretary.
[00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:05.487]  Of course, in the past, Leon Panetta has been the Director of the CIA, also an eight-term Congressman.
[00:04:05.867 --> 00:04:08.288]  He was also Bill Clinton's Chief of Staff.
[00:04:08.728 --> 00:04:19.770]  But here he is in the capacity of Defense Secretary, and he is asked by Senator Sessions, what if we're going to have a no-fly zone over Syria, if the President wanted to do that?
[00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.692]  Who would authorize that?
[00:04:21.753 --> 00:04:23.516]  And here's what Leon Panetta said.
[00:04:24.237 --> 00:04:32.553]  Do you think that you can act without Congress to initiate a no-fly zone in Syria without congressional approval?
[00:04:34.025 --> 00:04:51.177]  You know, again, our goal would be to seek international permission and we would come to the Congress and inform you and determine how best to approach this, whether or not we would want to get permission from the Congress.
[00:04:51.577 --> 00:04:55.220]  I think those are issues we would have to discuss as we decide what to do here.
[00:04:55.993 --> 00:04:59.136]  Well, I'm almost breathless about that.
[00:04:59.797 --> 00:05:07.626]  Because what I heard you say is, we're going to seek international approval, and they will come and tell the Congress what we might do.
[00:05:07.786 --> 00:05:10.048]  And we might seek congressional approval.
[00:05:10.068 --> 00:05:12.831]  I want to just say to you, that's a big dish.
[00:05:12.931 --> 00:05:17.376]  Wouldn't you agree, you've served in the Congress, wouldn't you agree that that's
[00:05:18.637 --> 00:05:25.143]  Would be pretty breathtaking to the average American, so would you like to clarify that?
[00:05:25.423 --> 00:05:34.651]  I've also served with Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents who have always reserved the right to defend this country if necessary.
[00:05:38.175 --> 00:05:43.039]  But before we do this, you would seek permission of the international authorities?
[00:05:44.443 --> 00:05:55.207]  If we're working with an international coalition and we're working with NATO, we would want to be able to get appropriate permissions in order to be able to do that.
[00:05:55.367 --> 00:06:01.629]  That's something that all of these countries would want to have some kind of legal basis on which to act.
[00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:03.950]  What legal basis are you looking for?
[00:06:05.171 --> 00:06:05.971]  What entity?
[00:06:07.332 --> 00:06:11.976]  Well, obviously, if NATO made the decision to go in, that would be one.
[00:06:12.917 --> 00:06:23.887]  If we developed an international coalition beyond NATO, then obviously some kind of UN security resolution would be the basis for that.
[00:06:23.927 --> 00:06:33.736]  So you're saying NATO would give you a legal basis, and an ad hoc coalition of nations would provide a legal basis?
[00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:47.173]  If we were able to put together a coalition and were able to move together, then obviously we would seek whatever legal basis we would need in order to make that justified.
[00:06:47.193 --> 00:06:55.315]  I mean, you know, we can't just pull them all together in a combat operation without getting the legal basis on which to act.
[00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:58.596]  Who are you asking for the legal basis from?
[00:07:01.027 --> 00:07:06.352]  If it's, obviously if the UN passed a security resolution as it did in Libya, we would do that.
[00:07:07.433 --> 00:07:11.696]  If NATO came together as we did in Bosnia, we would rely on that.
[00:07:11.997 --> 00:07:19.743]  So, you know, we have options here if we want to build the kind of international approach to dealing with the situation.
[00:07:19.763 --> 00:07:26.650]  Well, I'm all for having an international support, but I'm really baffled by the idea
[00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:35.358]  That somehow an international assembly provides a legal basis for the United States military to be deployed in combat.
[00:07:35.918 --> 00:07:38.821]  I don't believe it's close to being correct.
[00:07:39.722 --> 00:07:41.884]  They can provide no legal authority.
[00:07:42.204 --> 00:07:51.773]  The only legal authority that's required to deploy the United States military is the Congress and the President and the Constitution.
[00:07:52.267 --> 00:07:52.828]  Did you get that?
[00:07:53.008 --> 00:07:54.790]  Did you hear what Senator Sessions says?
[00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.432]  I can't believe what I'm hearing.
[00:07:57.072 --> 00:08:00.636]  Because, of course, Leon Panetta said and repeated this over and over again.
[00:08:00.656 --> 00:08:02.678]  Well, we'll ask NATO, we'll ask the UN.
[00:08:02.718 --> 00:08:03.539]  That's basically it.
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.661]  We're not going to ask Congress.
[00:08:04.981 --> 00:08:07.183]  We don't need no stinking congressional authorization.
[00:08:07.944 --> 00:08:13.950]  And of course, Senator Sessions understands what is happening with the loss of sovereignty.
[00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:27.161]  That was one example of it, but when we look at the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Transatlantic Partnerships, TTIP, TPP, he is the only senator, the only senator, who bothered to look at the bill.
[00:08:27.802 --> 00:08:29.104]  And he gave us a great insight.
[00:08:29.144 --> 00:08:30.525]  As a matter of fact, he stood up in the Senate.
[00:08:30.565 --> 00:08:37.693]  He had a presentation about how damaging it was going to be to America's economy, but also to America's sovereignty.
[00:08:37.733 --> 00:08:44.000]  He said, this is going to be, both of these partnerships, so-called partnerships, they're going to be living agreements.
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.141]  Do you understand what he means by that?
[00:08:45.822 --> 00:08:53.369]  What he means by that is that it isn't going to be ruled by these 5,000 pages that nobody else wants to even bother to read.
[00:08:53.949 --> 00:08:59.574]  It is going to be ruled by an international committee that these agreements, these partnerships create.
[00:09:00.174 --> 00:09:08.301]  Those international committees, unelected by us, unelected by any government, unaccountable to any government, will determine the trade
[00:09:09.102 --> 00:09:09.922]  We're good to go.
[00:09:29.768 --> 00:09:32.689]  He said, this election is our last chance to save U.S.
[00:09:32.729 --> 00:09:38.090]  sovereignty and to end the domination of the political establishment over the interests of working Americans.
[00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:49.053]  Trump alone has rejected the donor class, defending America's jobs and wages from open borders, uncontrolled immigration, and the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership that will cede U.S.
[00:09:49.113 --> 00:09:50.773]  authority to foreign powers.
[00:09:50.893 --> 00:09:57.055]  Trump's trade and immigration plans will revitalize our shrinking middle class, keeping jobs and wealth and income inside the U.S.
[00:09:57.095 --> 00:09:57.635]  of America.
[00:09:58.215 --> 00:10:02.920]  And Trump understands that a nation must always place the interests of its own people first.
[00:10:03.601 --> 00:10:04.722]  See, that's the core thing.
[00:10:05.222 --> 00:10:05.803]  That's the core thing.
[00:10:05.883 --> 00:10:13.431]  If we don't stop the globalist takeover of our economy, of our sovereignty, we don't have anything else here.
[00:10:13.931 --> 00:10:15.814]  Now, I look at civil liberties issues.
[00:10:15.934 --> 00:10:18.838]  I have strong, strong disagreements that remain with Donald Trump.
[00:10:18.878 --> 00:10:22.903]  I'm not under the illusion that he's somehow going to magically change his position on these issues.
[00:10:23.384 --> 00:10:27.409]  But every one of the other mainstream party candidates have that same position.
[00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:28.691]  He will, however.
[00:10:29.392 --> 00:10:32.233]  Change this globalist, elitist takeover.
[00:10:32.913 --> 00:10:37.015]  And, of course, he's now being attacked by the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:10:37.135 --> 00:10:40.837]  They've got multiple people that are going out throughout the media.
[00:10:41.097 --> 00:10:42.557]  Let's look at this AP story.
[00:10:43.878 --> 00:10:47.399]  Trump calls NAFTA trade deal a disaster, says he would break it.
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:48.820]  Oh, the horrors of that.
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.361]  Can you imagine somebody saying that?
[00:10:50.841 --> 00:10:54.582]  He says, I like free trade, but the problem with free trade is you need smart negotiators on your side.
[00:10:54.602 --> 00:10:55.863]  We have stupid people like we do.
[00:10:56.363 --> 00:10:59.565]  Free trade is no good, and of course I would say it is not free trade.
[00:10:59.845 --> 00:11:00.745]  It is managed trade.
[00:11:01.026 --> 00:11:04.567]  Trade managed by an unaccountable foreign commission.
[00:11:04.608 --> 00:11:08.810]  That's what Senator Sessions has made clear that the TPP, the TTIP are about.
[00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:17.535]  He says that NAFTA, the agreement between US, Canada and Mexico that was done about 22 years ago, he says is a disaster.
[00:11:17.595 --> 00:11:19.636]  He says every agreement has an end.
[00:11:20.156 --> 00:11:21.777]  Every agreement has to be fair.
[00:11:22.217 --> 00:11:25.119]  So he said we will either renegotiate it or we will break it.
[00:11:25.879 --> 00:11:30.901]  Now we have the Council on Foreign Relations people come out and push back against this.
[00:11:30.941 --> 00:11:36.303]  We have Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, an expert, they say, in foreign trade policy.
[00:11:36.323 --> 00:11:37.564]  This is what the AP calls him.
[00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:40.525]  He says he warned of tremendous consequences for business.
[00:11:40.565 --> 00:11:42.126]  Well, I'm going to show you in just a second.
[00:11:42.506 --> 00:11:48.192]  The tremendous consequences, not only for American businesses, but for American jobs that have resulted from NAFTA.
[00:11:48.212 --> 00:11:49.553]  But first, let's let him speak.
[00:11:49.593 --> 00:11:53.918]  He says you've got thousands and thousands of businesses, both sides of the border, that are set up to operate this way.
[00:11:53.938 --> 00:11:57.341]  Well, they were set up to operate in a different way before we had NAFTA.
[00:11:57.361 --> 00:11:59.143]  We're going to look at what that changed in just a moment.
[00:11:59.483 --> 00:12:01.966]  We've got another guy from CFR, Thomas Bollicky.
[00:12:02.426 --> 00:12:04.608]  He says it would be unwise, unnecessary.
[00:12:05.008 --> 00:12:14.535]  He said pulling out of NAFTA would have ramifications that would extend far beyond trade, putting into question other agreements negotiated by presidents, including the nuclear deal with Iran.
[00:12:16.196 --> 00:12:28.584]  Could you imagine if we had other agreements, quote-unquote, that were done unilaterally by the president that were essentially treaties, because that's what NAFTA was, that is what the nuclear deal with Iran is.
[00:12:29.105 --> 00:12:31.567]  Treaties that don't include the Senate.
[00:12:32.512 --> 00:12:36.313]  That is exactly the type of thing that Jeff Sessions was saying to Leon Panetta.
[00:12:37.214 --> 00:12:41.495]  How would you do, essentially start a war with Syria, perhaps with Russia?
[00:12:41.835 --> 00:12:45.717]  You wouldn't even involve the Congress, and of course they do these other deals too.
[00:12:46.217 --> 00:12:52.599]  They have to understand that deals that are not done according to our Constitution are not deals that we're going to honor, especially when they're bad deals.
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.300]  He says, I'm sure other countries would retaliate.
[00:12:55.521 --> 00:12:58.942]  He said Mexico, for instance, might scale back its purchase of U.S.
[00:12:58.982 --> 00:12:59.282]  goods.
[00:12:59.602 --> 00:13:00.122]  Oh, really?
[00:13:00.142 --> 00:13:01.123]  Oh, really?
[00:13:01.523 --> 00:13:04.644]  Let's take a look at the purchasing of U.S.
[00:13:04.685 --> 00:13:07.226]  goods and how NAFTA has really affected us.
[00:13:07.686 --> 00:13:09.167]  Take a look at this graphic here.
[00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:10.507]  What's happened to the U.S.
[00:13:10.827 --> 00:13:13.209]  trade between Mexico and the U.S.
[00:13:13.529 --> 00:13:14.269]  since NAFTA?
[00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:17.571]  If you look at this, you can see where it starts.
[00:13:18.331 --> 00:13:20.794]  You can see that before that we had some deficits with them.
[00:13:20.854 --> 00:13:22.976]  We had some trade surpluses.
[00:13:23.036 --> 00:13:24.257]  It was going back and forth.
[00:13:24.297 --> 00:13:26.820]  And it was a slight net to the U.S.
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:27.220]  side.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:32.265]  But as soon as we passed NAFTA, we started running massive budget deficits.
[00:13:32.666 --> 00:13:33.867]  And now when you extend this out,
[00:13:34.187 --> 00:13:41.349]  For 22 years, what we see is a $916 billion trade deficit with Mexico since this began.
[00:13:41.709 --> 00:13:42.029]  Okay?
[00:13:42.309 --> 00:13:43.689]  Even worse, because that goes back to 1990.
[00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:49.371]  That includes some of the years before NAFTA, where we had a trade surplus.
[00:13:49.771 --> 00:13:51.311]  A million jobs that were lost.
[00:13:51.351 --> 00:13:56.853]  And if you look at the breakdown on a year-by-year basis, you can see how we haven't had a single year.
[00:13:57.093 --> 00:14:02.394]  All of a sudden, as soon as they put in NAFTA, we had massive trade deficits that were a scale we'd never seen before.
[00:14:02.714 --> 00:14:06.537]  We were going back and forth, plus or minus 2 to 5 billion dollars a year.
[00:14:06.798 --> 00:14:12.182]  Then all of a sudden it went to minus 15 and it has increased and stayed negative since then.
[00:14:12.723 --> 00:14:15.785]  Let's go back to 2013, about three years ago.
[00:14:16.346 --> 00:14:16.986]  NAFTA at 20.
[00:14:17.507 --> 00:14:19.448]  This was a report that was put out by Public Citizen.
[00:14:19.809 --> 00:14:21.150]  A lot of people reported on this.
[00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:23.272]  This is Huffington Post's article about this.
[00:14:23.852 --> 00:14:29.357]  It was a report that looked at NAFTA at the age of 20, and here's some of the things the report found.
[00:14:29.437 --> 00:14:32.080]  They said, the study makes for a blood-boiling read.
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.541]  That's what Huffington Post said at the time.
[00:14:33.981 --> 00:14:35.943]  We track specific promises made by the U.S.
[00:14:35.983 --> 00:14:42.009]  corporations like GE, Chrysler, Caterpillar, to create specific numbers of American jobs if NAFTA was approved.
[00:14:42.429 --> 00:14:47.031]  And it reveals that government data showing that instead they fired U.S.
[00:14:47.071 --> 00:14:55.115]  workers, they moved operations to Mexico, it's resulted in middle class pay cuts, it's caused growing income inequality.
[00:14:55.576 --> 00:14:56.076]  The U.S.
[00:14:56.116 --> 00:15:03.620]  trade deficit growth with Mexico and Canada has been 45% higher than with countries that were not a party to the U.S.
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:04.540]  Free Trade Agreement.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:05.821]  And U.S.
[00:15:05.901 --> 00:15:10.783]  manufacturing exports to Canada and Mexico have grown at less than half the pre-NAFTA rate.
[00:15:10.803 --> 00:15:11.784]  You understand what's going on?
[00:15:12.344 --> 00:15:29.655]  So to repeat that, 45% higher trade deficit with Canada and Mexico after the free trade agreement, our exports to them did not grow as fast as they did to the rest of the world, yet we're supposed to believe that the TPP and the TTIP are somehow going to
[00:15:30.515 --> 00:15:31.475]  Bring us prosperity.
[00:15:31.515 --> 00:15:36.137]  No, they will do exactly the same thing that we have seen happen with Canada and Mexico.
[00:15:36.557 --> 00:15:39.639]  And here's what Huffington Post says, and see if this sounds familiar to you.
[00:15:40.199 --> 00:15:43.260]  Demonstrates why NAFTA should be renegotiated or terminated.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.020]  Hear that?
[00:15:44.581 --> 00:15:48.042]  Huffington Post said three years ago the same thing Donald Trump just said.
[00:15:48.562 --> 00:15:52.464]  Demonstrating why NAFTA should be renegotiated or terminated.
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:54.341]  Exactly.
[00:15:54.501 --> 00:15:56.282]  That is the problem that is before us.
[00:15:56.322 --> 00:16:04.588]  And that's why the financial elites, that's why the GOP elites, who are controlled by the financial elites, want to stop Donald Trump.
[00:16:04.608 --> 00:16:06.390]  That's why they're so concerned about this.
[00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:11.574]  This article we have from Kurt Nemo, financial elite are worried as Trump sweeps the primaries.
[00:16:11.714 --> 00:16:15.417]  And in this we've got more people from the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:16:15.757 --> 00:16:24.444]  Two more individuals from CFR, Ben Steele and another individual, Max Boot, are both talking about how Trump has to be stopped.
[00:16:24.464 --> 00:16:29.688]  They say, Trump is prepared to abrogate America's commitment to globalist trade deals.
[00:16:30.148 --> 00:16:32.850]  And they point to his vociferous opposition to the TPP.
[00:16:33.911 --> 00:16:40.314]  And then they both write, a Trump presidency threatens the post-World War II liberal international order.
[00:16:40.394 --> 00:16:43.336]  No, that's the new world order as George Bush puts it.
[00:16:43.556 --> 00:16:45.397]  It's not liberal, it's bipartisan.
[00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:49.599]  It is a new world order that is part of the global establishment.
[00:16:49.679 --> 00:16:58.704]  It is what's behind the massive economic decline that we're seeing in the middle class, the loss of jobs, the export of jobs, the imports of
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.801]  Of workers coming into this country.
[00:17:02.341 --> 00:17:08.343]  So the American presidents of both parties have so laboriously built up this order that is based on free trade.
[00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:11.304]  And again, it is not based on free trade.
[00:17:11.964 --> 00:17:23.728]  Now, as we get close to Super Tuesday, and as Donald Trump's lead builds, we have this article up on Infowars.com, the latest poll shows him nationally 33 points above Marco Rubio, who is in second place with 16.
[00:17:23.768 --> 00:17:25.309]  Cruz is in third place at 15%.
[00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:35.935]  Trump was at 24% back in September, and of course, at that time, Karl Rove was telling everybody, well, you know, Donald Trump only has a 30% ceiling.
[00:17:36.135 --> 00:17:41.999]  Everybody, as these candidates drop out, everybody is going to consolidate around someone else.
[00:17:42.299 --> 00:17:45.781]  But now we're getting very close to Super Tuesday.
[00:17:46.342 --> 00:17:50.444]  And the thirst for power brings out the worst in people, as we see here.
[00:17:51.945 --> 00:17:54.227]  They stole it from us.
[00:17:55.273 --> 00:17:55.594]  Nope.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:21.664]  That's right, on this election eve we have many who are trying to get this ring of power, seeing it slip through their finger, and they're getting their gollum on.
[00:18:21.684 --> 00:18:29.048]  We're going to take a look at some of the dirty tricks that are surfacing tonight and surface this weekend when we come back, but this is also a leap year.
[00:18:29.528 --> 00:18:32.750]  February the 29th and we have our once every four year sale.
[00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:38.294]  We have 30% off and free shipping on everything in the InfoWars store that will end tonight.
[00:18:38.354 --> 00:18:39.935]  So don't miss that opportunity.
[00:18:40.275 --> 00:18:42.317]  A once in every four year opportunity.
[00:18:42.357 --> 00:18:45.259]  The biggest sale we've had at the InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:18:45.559 --> 00:18:46.220]  So stay with us.
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:50.062]  We're going to be right back with what's dirty, what's tricksy, what's false.
[00:18:50.582 --> 00:18:50.963]  Stay with us.
[00:19:01.172 --> 00:19:05.335]  And I wanna say, PUT ON THESE GLASSES OR START CHEWING CONCRETE!
[00:19:06.536 --> 00:19:10.419]  I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.042]  And I'm all out of bubblegum!
[00:19:15.303 --> 00:19:17.344]  Time to take a stand, boys!
[00:19:17.945 --> 00:19:23.469]  I'm Alex Jones, and like Rowdy Piper, I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick globalist butt.
[00:19:24.744 --> 00:19:32.211]  It's time for all of you, the Infowarriors, and myself included, to take our fight to the next level and to help the public put the sunglasses on.
[00:19:32.531 --> 00:19:41.219]  The metaphor for expanding your awareness, researching what's happening, and admitting there's a global elite establishing a planetary tyranny.
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.381]  And I was just thinking about it today.
[00:19:44.362 --> 00:19:45.843]  It's leap year coming up on Monday.
[00:19:46.464 --> 00:19:49.666]  That only happens every four years at the end of February.
[00:19:50.444 --> 00:19:54.607]  And this is the best time ever to promote liberty and freedom everywhere.
[00:19:55.187 --> 00:20:07.596]  We got Super Tuesday coming up next week and it's important for Americans to be involved in their political process, but not just in their political process, in every action you take with what you talk about and
[00:20:09.076 --> 00:20:13.658]  The products you buy and what you promote, you affect change in the world.
[00:20:14.018 --> 00:20:20.121]  We don't just vote at the ballot box, we vote with our dollars, we vote with our feet, we vote with our actions.
[00:20:20.881 --> 00:20:32.547]  And that's why for Leap Year, running from this Friday evening right through Monday evening, we're running the biggest sale in the history of 20 plus years of InfoWars and InfoWars.com.
[00:20:33.027 --> 00:20:36.348]  The Leap Year Special only comes around every four years.
[00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:45.771]  30% off all products at InfoWarsStore.com and free shipping on top of the discounts that are already there.
[00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:56.235]  This is a major loss leader with some of the products, but overall it will help us fund the InfoWars operation and get our reporters out there across the world covering what's happening.
[00:20:56.615 --> 00:20:58.115]  The planet is ready to wake up.
[00:20:58.535 --> 00:20:59.636]  People are ready for the truth.
[00:21:00.256 --> 00:21:13.161]  But to do that, those of you already awake have to redouble your efforts spreading the word and directing people to good sources of pro-human information like InfoWars.com, my syndicated radio show, The Nightly News, and more.
[00:21:13.861 --> 00:21:17.763]  I'll be back this Sunday live, 4-6pm, with a Sunday radio show as well.
[00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:25.466]  But in the meantime, take the time out to visit InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com to find the specific nutraceuticals
[00:21:25.726 --> 00:21:25.986]  Thank you.
[00:21:43.817 --> 00:21:46.699]  Good halogen ever, and what it does is simply amazing.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:52.885]  Read the 5-star reviews at InfoWarsLife.com today, and take advantage of the biggest sale ever in InfoWars history.
[00:21:53.205 --> 00:22:01.672]  And on top of that, I finally want to thank all of you that have spread the word about the broadcast, and that have supported us and our sponsors, and bought the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:22:01.832 --> 00:22:04.014]  Because without you, none of this would have been possible.
[00:22:04.594 --> 00:22:23.168]  My pledge to you is that I will keep the sunglasses on and this operation will be a sunglass factory in the metaphor or the allegory of they live and that we will help humanity take the blinders off, come out of the cave and defeat this globalist system that's being constructed.
[00:22:23.628 --> 00:22:25.730]  Now back to InfoWars Nightly News and more.
[00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:26.711]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:30.472 --> 00:22:31.993]  Take a stand, boys.
[00:22:32.454 --> 00:22:33.154]  You know what?
[00:22:33.174 --> 00:22:34.756]  You've got a little courage.
[00:22:34.836 --> 00:22:36.197]  Stand up for yourself.
[00:22:38.139 --> 00:22:40.561]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:22:40.721 --> 00:22:46.066]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:22:47.267 --> 00:22:51.271]  The Oscar winners give a press conference and how to buy a sailboat.
[00:22:51.411 --> 00:22:53.853]  Long live the Republic!
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.723]  Of course, it's the last couple of days before a very big election.
[00:23:08.763 --> 00:23:09.824]  Super Tuesday is tomorrow.
[00:23:10.584 --> 00:23:13.967]  And we have everyone getting their gollum on, as we pointed out, as we're going to break.
[00:23:13.987 --> 00:23:17.930]  You know, calling people a tricksy, false liar, murderer.
[00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.971]  Let's take a look at that last charge.
[00:23:20.272 --> 00:23:20.812]  Murderer.
[00:23:21.072 --> 00:23:22.694]  And look at who it's coming from.
[00:23:23.374 --> 00:23:36.403]  None other than Michael Hayden, former NSA CIA director, Clinton appointee, who is now wading into the presidential race, going on Fox News and other places, complaining about Donald Trump.
[00:23:36.423 --> 00:23:40.006]  What would a Donald Trump presidency actually look like, asks Huffington Post.
[00:23:40.446 --> 00:23:42.128]  So they asked this guy.
[00:23:42.748 --> 00:23:57.894]  This guy who has been part of the disposition matrix, where they assassinate people with drones, okay, where they spy on every aspect of our lives, and he has had the audacity to go on programs with Judge Napolitano saying, I'm a libertarian.
[00:23:58.194 --> 00:24:00.336]  It's like, yeah, right, you're a libertarian, okay?
[00:24:00.756 --> 00:24:05.880]  But here's where he comes up and he takes this libertarian pose again in terms of criticizing Donald Trump.
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:10.924]  He says, if Trump were to make good on his vow to kill terrorist family members, the U.S.
[00:24:10.964 --> 00:24:13.085]  military, he said, would refuse to act.
[00:24:13.405 --> 00:24:16.768]  He said, you're required not to follow an unlawful order.
[00:24:17.088 --> 00:24:20.071]  That would be a violation of all the international laws of armed conflicts.
[00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:22.414]  Yeah, it would also be a violation of the Constitution.
[00:24:22.454 --> 00:24:25.918]  But of course, Michael Hayden doesn't seem to care about the Constitution.
[00:24:26.238 --> 00:24:37.691]  And we need to take that phrase from Michael Hayden, thrown out in the heat of an election, and we need to put that on a plaque on the wall so that people in the military, people in the NSA,
[00:24:38.692 --> 00:24:46.954]  In the CIA, understand that there are laws that transcend the orders from people like Michael Hayden.
[00:24:47.634 --> 00:24:48.475]  We need to understand that.
[00:24:48.735 --> 00:24:59.798]  He's calling people to stand up in a way against, as people were called on to do in the Nuremberg trial, saying you don't excuse this action by saying I was just following orders.
[00:25:00.038 --> 00:25:00.598]  That's very true.
[00:25:01.278 --> 00:25:09.102]  He remembers that as we progress into the police state, as we continue down this road, that he has pushed us down so many times.
[00:25:09.662 --> 00:25:27.472]  And I think that in one way, if Donald Trump takes an authoritarian bent as he is talking, as he does the same things that the rest of the GOP candidates are saying, as the Democrats have done, bragging that they're going to step up the authoritarian police state, Donald Trump might actually help us to push this back.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:28.900]  By talking about it.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.281]  It actually might wake people up.
[00:25:30.601 --> 00:25:33.362]  Especially when we see things like the libel laws versus First Amendment.
[00:25:33.442 --> 00:25:35.882]  Understand that we are not electing a dictator.
[00:25:36.143 --> 00:25:40.384]  There are ways that we can push back and must push back against all of these people.
[00:25:40.424 --> 00:25:45.165]  Not just a Donald Trump, but against a President Cruz or Rubio or Obama or Hillary Clinton.
[00:25:45.425 --> 00:25:46.666]  They all want to take our freedoms.
[00:25:46.966 --> 00:25:49.167]  We must push back on our own.
[00:25:49.367 --> 00:25:54.788]  Individually refusing to do what they say and collectively at our state and local levels.
[00:25:54.848 --> 00:25:56.589]  Even with jury nullification as an individual.
[00:25:56.957 --> 00:25:58.138]  Let's look at what Cruz is doing.
[00:25:58.178 --> 00:26:03.722]  Cruz is taking the canard that was put out there by Romney, saying we're going to take a look at his tax returns.
[00:26:04.042 --> 00:26:05.483]  I'm sure there's bombshell stuff in there.
[00:26:05.523 --> 00:26:09.166]  So Cruz is taking it to the next level, talking about mafia ties.
[00:26:09.186 --> 00:26:16.191]  He said maybe it's the case that Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia, maybe his taxes show these business dealings.
[00:26:16.732 --> 00:26:18.713]  That is a sign of desperation.
[00:26:19.154 --> 00:26:21.455]  He says Donald seems to be terrified to release his taxes.
[00:26:21.715 --> 00:26:23.277]  It suggests there might be a bombshell there.
[00:26:23.837 --> 00:26:24.317]  Well, you know what?
[00:26:24.978 --> 00:26:32.402]  I would be far more interested in Ted Cruz if he would complain about the IRS acting like a mafia.
[00:26:32.522 --> 00:26:38.006]  Remember the IRS that came after and still continues to go after its political enemies in the Tea Party?
[00:26:38.486 --> 00:26:41.788]  The IRS that Ted Cruz at one point in time said, we need to shut down?
[00:26:42.348 --> 00:26:43.989]  Well, he's shut up about that, hasn't he?
[00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:45.991]  He doesn't seem to have a problem with the IRS.
[00:26:46.031 --> 00:26:52.255]  Now, if the IRS is auditing you, maybe you're a criminal or a terrorist, according to Ted Cruz now, because it suits his
[00:26:52.955 --> 00:26:55.056]  position to try to tear somebody down.
[00:26:55.096 --> 00:26:58.356]  Look at what the Daily News is doing in New York.
[00:26:58.416 --> 00:27:07.399]  Of course, this is a rag that has criticized Donald Trump over and over again, but also calling the NRA's Wayne LaPierre a terrorist multiple times.
[00:27:07.699 --> 00:27:20.342]  Now what they're saying is this event that happened today in Virginia, where a time photographer was slammed to the ground by a Secret Service agent, they're reporting many hours after the rest of the media is reporting that it was a
[00:27:21.022 --> 00:27:22.703]  Secret Service agent.
[00:27:22.763 --> 00:27:24.744]  It wasn't somebody that was hired by Donald Trump.
[00:27:24.985 --> 00:27:28.467]  They're continuing to report that it was Trump's security.
[00:27:29.107 --> 00:27:30.248]  They have it in the headlines.
[00:27:30.268 --> 00:27:35.211]  There you can see the caption to the picture says Trump security slams a photographer to the ground.
[00:27:35.591 --> 00:27:36.952]  Then they say shows him on his back.
[00:27:37.412 --> 00:27:40.874]  Futilely kicking as a member of Trump's security detail.
[00:27:41.274 --> 00:27:41.874]  Did this to him.
[00:27:42.135 --> 00:27:45.276]  The security officer grabbed his neck, briefly choked him during the takedown.
[00:27:45.696 --> 00:27:47.037]  And then they talk about what happened.
[00:27:47.097 --> 00:27:48.278]  I never punched him, said Morris.
[00:27:48.318 --> 00:27:48.878]  I never touched him.
[00:27:48.938 --> 00:27:52.240]  They said, but the video shows that he did reach for the security officer's throat.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:28:09.847]  Continually referring to it as the security officer, until the very last two paragraphs, where the New York Daily News, in a fit of, a little bit of honesty I guess, trying to protect themselves from accusations of being a biased rag as they truly are, said,
[00:28:10.387 --> 00:28:15.513]  It is unclear whether the security staffer was a member of Trump's Secret Service detail or a member of his private security team.
[00:28:15.613 --> 00:28:22.320]  Other reporters there said he was wearing a badge on his hip and a red lapel pin, which is normally worn by government agents.
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:31.149]  And yes, the rest of the news media has pretty much reported that it was a Secret Service agent, except for those who are incredibly biased like the New York Daily News.
[00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:32.010]  Again,
[00:28:32.631 --> 00:28:41.941]  The claims to take down Donald Trump saying that he is a Ku Klux Klan supporter because we have David Duke coming out and saying that he supports him.
[00:28:42.122 --> 00:28:43.703]  He was defended by Mike Huckabee.
[00:28:44.104 --> 00:28:49.490]  Mike Huckabee said, and this is reported on Politico, does anybody really think that Donald Trump is a racist?
[00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:55.175]  Huckabee said on MSNBC's Morning Joe Show, he said, David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan are absolutely abominable.
[00:28:55.575 --> 00:28:58.979]  I don't know anybody that I know, anybody that I've ever known, that supports them.
[00:28:59.019 --> 00:29:02.081]  And look, I think there's an incredible, just an overwhelming fascination.
[00:29:02.121 --> 00:29:03.303]  I've been watching this this morning.
[00:29:03.323 --> 00:29:05.044]  But look, let me ask you this.
[00:29:05.204 --> 00:29:12.631]  Do you think Hillary Clinton is going to have to answer for her relationship with Senator Robert Byrd, who was an actual member of the KKK?
[00:29:12.931 --> 00:29:14.173]  A high-ranking member, I would add.
[00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:21.375]  Look, I'm not trying to defend, but maybe in an artful way, and then he has a comeback from Joe Scarborough.
[00:29:22.095 --> 00:29:26.137]  Mike Huckabee comes back and says, does anybody really think Donald Trump is a racist?
[00:29:26.397 --> 00:29:31.799]  I don't mean, I don't really mean, I don't know of anything in his life that indicates this man has racist tendencies.
[00:29:31.839 --> 00:29:38.321]  Here's the thing, I doubt he's as sensitive to just how deplorable David Duke is to many of us in the South, said Mike Huckabee.
[00:29:38.721 --> 00:29:45.147]  I think it's because I'm from the South, I'm more sensitive, frankly more repulsed by racism than maybe people who didn't grow up here.
[00:29:45.687 --> 00:29:47.629]  Well here's what I would be more afraid of, he said.
[00:29:48.069 --> 00:30:04.384]  I would be afraid that it's the end of the Republican Party, not because of Donald Trump, but because of people being fed up with the Republican Party that is so elitist, so snobbish, that they demand not just Donald Trump, but they demand of me and every other Republican candidate a loyalty to the party.
[00:30:04.464 --> 00:30:05.505]  And if we have an election,
[00:30:05.945 --> 00:30:07.166]  And that's how we select presidents.
[00:30:07.446 --> 00:30:08.087]  We elect them.
[00:30:08.107 --> 00:30:10.249]  We don't select them by the party bosses.
[00:30:10.529 --> 00:30:12.911]  If the party bosses don't get the guy they want, what are they going to do?
[00:30:12.931 --> 00:30:15.413]  They're going to disavow the person that the people wanted?
[00:30:15.473 --> 00:30:17.174]  See, that's precisely the issue.
[00:30:17.415 --> 00:30:23.299]  Remember, the very first question of the very first debate was, raise your hands, would you run as an independent?
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.601]  And honestly, Donald Trump said, well, I would think about it.
[00:30:25.661 --> 00:30:29.845]  And he was excoriated, first by Rand Paul, then by the rest of the GOP establishment.
[00:30:30.285 --> 00:30:36.749]  Yet, after demanding these loyalty oaths from Donald Trump, we still have rights previous come on and say, understand what's going on.
[00:30:36.809 --> 00:30:37.829]  It's not really an election.
[00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:41.392]  They're kind of trying out to join us.
[00:30:41.432 --> 00:30:42.012]  Remember that clip?
[00:30:42.032 --> 00:30:43.333]  They're going to join us.
[00:30:44.468 --> 00:30:45.949]  The people who control the party.
[00:30:46.449 --> 00:30:47.370]  That's the way they see this.
[00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:50.292]  They don't really care what you, the voters, think.
[00:30:50.953 --> 00:31:07.344]  And if they push this through, and if the Democrats push through Hillary Clinton over the popular selection of Bernie Sanders, if he does better in the primaries, of course they've already given her over 500 delegates with their superdelegates, but if they jerry-rig that, it is going to be a massive realignment.
[00:31:07.524 --> 00:31:10.447]  If there is something magical about the two-party system, and I don't believe there is,
[00:31:11.127 --> 00:31:15.338]  People are going to say, these aren't the two parties that we want.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.987]  What if Donald Trump won the presidency and what if?
[00:31:19.912 --> 00:31:24.713]  He then created a new party, putting the Republicans far behind him.
[00:31:25.034 --> 00:31:26.274]  Finally, one last thing.
[00:31:26.314 --> 00:31:35.337]  Let's take a look at the people behind Ted Cruz, because he's the one that has essentially come out with the dirty tricks, being so desperate for power.
[00:31:35.557 --> 00:31:42.159]  We've seen Marco Rubio, who is in the same place, throwing out childish insults, kind of like a Hispanic Dan Quayle.
[00:31:42.699 --> 00:31:42.939]  Okay.
[00:31:43.199 --> 00:31:44.481]  But let's look at Ted Cruz.
[00:31:44.561 --> 00:31:46.102]  And this is an article from Politico.
[00:31:46.582 --> 00:31:48.964]  The man behind Ted Cruz's tricks.
[00:31:49.144 --> 00:31:51.386]  They say Ted Cruz likes to say personnel is policy.
[00:31:51.707 --> 00:31:57.832]  But the single most important personnel decision he's made in the 2016 presidential campaign has become his most controversial.
[00:31:58.212 --> 00:32:00.334]  They say his motto is trust Ted.
[00:32:00.834 --> 00:32:07.996]  But in selecting his campaign manager, Cruz tapped a take-no-prisoners operative that is well-practiced in the political dark arts.
[00:32:08.036 --> 00:32:11.617]  They talk to people who call him the master of sleazy politics.
[00:32:11.897 --> 00:32:15.218]  They say his calling card has long been a win-at-all-cost campaign.
[00:32:15.838 --> 00:32:22.679]  And they point out that if you're going to campaign as a pious, fundamentalist Christian, you don't bring somebody like Jeff Rowe in.
[00:32:23.079 --> 00:32:28.761]  Jeff Rowe was somebody who was his opposition when he ran in the Senate primary against Dewhurst.
[00:32:29.341 --> 00:32:34.065]  He said, he tried to impugn my patriotism, and then he hired him as his representative.
[00:32:34.525 --> 00:32:39.329]  So when we see these types of tricks that are coming out, we understand precisely what they're about.
[00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:43.952]  Stay with us when we come back, a special report on the race baiters and the dirty tricks.
[00:32:44.012 --> 00:32:48.035]  And then, a look at the first robot car caused accident.
[00:32:48.195 --> 00:32:48.736]  We'll be right back.
[00:33:02.028 --> 00:33:06.191]  And I wanna say, PUT ON THESE GLASSES OR START CHEWING CONCRETE!
[00:33:07.371 --> 00:33:11.254]  I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.
[00:33:12.795 --> 00:33:14.896]  And I'm all out of bubblegum!
[00:33:16.157 --> 00:33:18.198]  Time to take a stand, boys!
[00:33:18.778 --> 00:33:24.302]  I'm Alex Jones, and like Rowdy Piper, I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick gloveless butt.
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:33.046]  It's time for all of you, the Infowarriors, and myself included, to take our fight to the next level and to help the public put the sunglasses on.
[00:33:33.386 --> 00:33:42.054]  The metaphor for expanding your awareness, researching what's happening, and admitting there's a global elite establishing a planetary tyranny.
[00:33:42.974 --> 00:33:44.215]  And I was just thinking about it today.
[00:33:45.196 --> 00:33:46.677]  It's leap year coming up on Monday.
[00:33:47.298 --> 00:33:50.501]  That only happens every four years at the end of February.
[00:33:51.277 --> 00:33:51.337]  And
[00:34:09.932 --> 00:34:14.494]  The products you buy and what you promote, you affect change in the world.
[00:34:14.874 --> 00:34:20.957]  We don't just vote at the ballot box, we vote with our dollars, we vote with our feet, we vote with our actions.
[00:34:21.737 --> 00:34:33.383]  And that's why for Leap Year, running from this Friday evening right through Monday evening, we're running the biggest sale in the history of 20 plus years of InfoWars and InfoWars.com.
[00:34:33.863 --> 00:34:37.207]  The Leap Year Special only comes around every four years.

[00:34:42.782 --> 00:34:46.625]  Free shipping on top of the discounts that are already there.
[00:34:46.865 --> 00:34:57.093]  This is a major loss leader with some of the products, but overall it will help us fund the InfoMores operation and get our reporters out there across the world covering what's happening.
[00:34:57.473 --> 00:34:58.954]  The planet is ready to wake up.
[00:34:59.394 --> 00:35:00.495]  People are ready for the truth.
[00:35:01.116 --> 00:35:05.259]  But to do that, those of you already awake have to redouble your efforts spreading the word.
[00:35:05.979 --> 00:35:06.539]  We're good to go.
[00:35:26.565 --> 00:35:27.025]  We're good to go!
[00:35:44.654 --> 00:35:47.516]  Good halogen ever, and what it does is simply amazing.
[00:35:47.596 --> 00:35:53.720]  Read the 5-star reviews at InfoWarsLife.com today, and take advantage of the biggest sale ever in InfoWars history.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:36:02.505]  And on top of that, I finally want to thank all of you that have spread the word about the broadcast, and that have supported us and our sponsors, and bought the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:36:02.665 --> 00:36:04.847]  Because without you, none of this would have been possible.
[00:36:05.427 --> 00:36:24.006]  My pledge to you is that I will keep the sunglasses on and this operation will be a sunglass factory in the metaphor or the allegory of they live and that we will help humanity take the blinders off, come out of the cave and defeat this globalist system that's being constructed.
[00:36:24.487 --> 00:36:26.569]  Now back to InfoWars Nightly News and more.
[00:36:26.949 --> 00:36:27.570]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:36:31.308 --> 00:36:32.829]  Take a stand, boys.
[00:36:33.329 --> 00:36:34.030]  You know what?
[00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:35.571]  You got a little courage.
[00:36:35.671 --> 00:36:37.052]  Stand up for yourself.
[00:36:38.953 --> 00:36:41.395]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:36:41.575 --> 00:36:46.899]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:52.102]  The Oscar winners give a press conference and how to buy a sailboat.
[00:37:25.489 --> 00:37:38.700]  The racial division flaring up in the United States, imposed on the average non-racist American by the self-anointed leaders of the African-American community, based on the color of our skin, appears to be imploding.
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:53.672]  Whether it's Hollywood's Academy Awards, the annual self-important spectacle crashed by the cloud of racism lurking over its proceedings, awarding Chris Rock's Black Host Matters monologue style with ratings reaching an eight-year low.
[00:37:54.332 --> 00:37:55.533]  Is Hollywood racist?
[00:37:56.073 --> 00:38:00.796]  You're damn right Hollywood's racist, but it ain't that racist that you've grown accustomed to.
[00:38:01.256 --> 00:38:04.658]  Hollywood is sorority racist.
[00:38:05.199 --> 00:38:07.920]  We're MSNBC, Racebaiters Central.
[00:38:08.261 --> 00:38:16.486]  Nothing less than a government-funded megaphone for the media prostitutes launching their New World Order division diatribe on a nightly basis.
[00:38:17.338 --> 00:38:22.621]  Well, I think many people would like to see an African American on the Supreme Court.
[00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:27.603]  We don't really need to go into Clarence Thomas' background or his behavior.
[00:38:27.963 --> 00:38:41.270]  Steve Watson writes, What Sharpton and Bass are really implying is that they want to see someone nominated to the Supreme Court who will play the race card and will make decisions based not on whether or not they are consistent with the U.S.
[00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:44.672]  Constitution, but based on the color of his or her skin.
[00:38:45.052 --> 00:38:57.661]  Indeed, Justice Thomas recently asserted that the nation is far too obsessed with racial differences, prompting liberals to hurl racist slurs, while others implied that the black judge was himself being racist.
[00:38:57.941 --> 00:39:10.490]  MSNBC's Rachel Maddow blog responded to Thomas' speech by attempting to argue that more race consciousness was a good thing because nobody wanted to return to the 1960s Jim Crow era.
[00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:14.513]  A CNN segment also implied that Thomas himself was racist,
[00:39:14.713 --> 00:39:17.734]  For wanting to move on from race even being an issue.
[00:39:18.214 --> 00:39:29.997]  Sharpton also suggested that Senate resistance to confirming a new justice is another sign that the Senate does not consider Obama to be a legitimate president due to his race.
[00:39:30.457 --> 00:39:37.499]  And now a major mouthpiece of weaponized inequality has been relieved of her post, Melissa Harris Perry.
[00:39:37.861 --> 00:39:51.844]  But I want us to be super careful when we use the language hard worker because I actually keep an image of folks working in cotton fields on my office wall because it is a reminder about what hard work looks like.
[00:39:51.904 --> 00:40:01.907]  We have to create a safety net for poor people and when we won't because they happen to look different from us, it is the pervasive of ugliness!
[00:40:02.287 --> 00:40:07.891]  was dismissed from MSNBC on February 28th due to these comments from an email.
[00:40:08.212 --> 00:40:13.596]  She wrote, Perry wanted to continue her platform of division in the glorification of New World Order policy.
[00:40:22.563 --> 00:40:38.688]  Whether it was opiating the masses with the Obama administration's plan to install a government worker to oversee every child in America, believe it or not, the deceptive Black Lives Matter movement is a counterfeit movement funded by billionaire George Soros.
[00:40:39.088 --> 00:40:47.895]  And it's the brainchild of the New World Order establishment, intended to divide America and drive us towards their vision of a civil war.
[00:40:48.155 --> 00:40:52.419]  The irony is that millions of Americans are descended from many races.
[00:40:52.679 --> 00:41:05.610]  Reason clearly dictates that all Americans should resolve and finally overcome these issues together, and not as divided sheep to be led by the lunacy revered by the elitist social engineers.
[00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:16.836]  Since the 1970s, we were already making progress on equality without the help of genocidal eugenics-touting psychopaths, so much so that they had to intervene.
[00:41:17.357 --> 00:41:28.163]  Millennial generation, where is the grassroots movement of true American racial equality to counter the force-fed, billionaire-backed Black Lives Matter movement?
[00:41:28.403 --> 00:41:29.444]  Until that happens,
[00:41:30.004 --> 00:41:41.799]  A xenophobic stupidity of racial division will slowly increase and your generation and future generations will be completely consumed by the New World Order agenda.
[00:41:42.219 --> 00:41:44.142]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:41:45.143 --> 00:41:48.366]  Well, today we had Google do something very unprecedented.
[00:41:48.767 --> 00:41:51.990]  They actually admitted that their car caused an accident.
[00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.871]  Their robot car.
[00:41:53.131 --> 00:41:54.913]  Well, kind of, they admitted.
[00:41:55.313 --> 00:41:55.934]  Not exactly.
[00:41:56.415 --> 00:42:01.299]  But the AP reports a Google self-driving car has struck a public bus in California.
[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:07.541]  Now, no one was hurt, of course, because there were probably fewer people on the bus than were in the robot car, okay?
[00:42:07.781 --> 00:42:21.625]  But this is really kind of the past in terms of public transportation, the buses that nobody likes or uses, colliding with the future, the robot cars that nobody likes and probably won't want to use.
[00:42:22.005 --> 00:42:22.765]  This is what happened.
[00:42:23.393 --> 00:42:33.109]  The robot car from Google was trying to get around some sandbags that were in the road and decided that it would nudge out, as they say in the AP, that would nudge out at two miles per hour.
[00:42:33.209 --> 00:42:33.970]  Two miles per hour.
[00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:35.731]  That may be why they got hit.
[00:42:36.151 --> 00:42:43.015]  It collided with a bus which was traveling at 15 miles per hour, so it pulled out and again did it very, very slowly in front of the bus.
[00:42:43.275 --> 00:42:49.379]  The car's test driver, who under state law must be in the front seat to grab the wheel when needed, thought the bus would yield.
[00:42:49.759 --> 00:42:51.701]  Of course, because this is a Google car.
[00:42:51.901 --> 00:42:53.262]  I mean, watch out for my Google car.
[00:42:54.002 --> 00:42:56.944]  Did not have control when the collision happened according to Google.
[00:42:57.504 --> 00:43:08.090]  Now while the report does not address fault in a written statement, Google said, we clearly bear some responsibility because if our car hadn't moved there wouldn't have been a collision.
[00:43:10.303 --> 00:43:18.246]  That's about as evasive as you can imagine when somebody tries to accept responsibility for the fact that they pulled out in front of another car and got hit.
[00:43:18.786 --> 00:43:19.726]  That's essentially what happened.
[00:43:19.946 --> 00:43:21.587]  They bear some responsibility.
[00:43:21.907 --> 00:43:23.807]  And we have seen this over and over again from Google.
[00:43:24.307 --> 00:43:38.632]  We have seen, even though they have had nearly a dozen collisions in and around the Mountain View area, as AP reports, since starting to test on the streets in spring of 2015, in most cases Google cars were rear-ended, so they say it wasn't their fault.
[00:43:39.432 --> 00:43:45.799]  I have driven with people who drive like this robot car does, and I can guarantee you that it was their fault.
[00:43:46.079 --> 00:43:50.984]  If you've got that many times that you've been rear-ended in a year, then it is your fault.
[00:43:51.124 --> 00:43:52.325]  It is the way you're driving.
[00:43:52.725 --> 00:43:59.873]  Understand that it isn't just the people who speed on our roads, it's the people who are driving incessantly slow, who are very uncertain.
[00:44:00.293 --> 00:44:01.434]  Afraid of the road.
[00:44:01.694 --> 00:44:03.956]  And that's the way this robot car is behaving.
[00:44:04.416 --> 00:44:08.939]  Also understand that as I point out, well under state law there has to be a driver in the car.
[00:44:08.979 --> 00:44:11.861]  He didn't take over because he thought everything was going to be okay.
[00:44:11.901 --> 00:44:13.022]  The bus was going to stop.
[00:44:13.783 --> 00:44:18.306]  They have moved to have the Department of Transportation, the Obama administration,
[00:44:19.611 --> 00:44:21.872]  Restrict that restriction on people.
[00:44:21.952 --> 00:44:27.175]  Remove that safety that is being imposed by California and by other states.
[00:44:27.555 --> 00:44:31.176]  They're concerned about this driving record that the Google cars have had.
[00:44:31.216 --> 00:44:34.478]  They say they want to make sure there's always a human behind the wheel.
[00:44:34.878 --> 00:44:40.341]  But Google is using its muscle at the federal level to remove that safety.
[00:44:40.801 --> 00:44:42.562]  Understand that that's really what's happening now.
[00:44:43.542 --> 00:45:04.319]  And of course, when we look at what's happening with other aspects of the Internet of Things that is extending to our highways, engulfing our cars, even if they are not going to be robot cars that are quote-unquote self-driving, we still have to be concerned about what's going to happen with vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication as our cars join the Internet of Things.
[00:45:04.339 --> 00:45:05.020]  Look at this article.
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:12.248]  From Car and Driver, Nissan blocking Leaf smartphone app due to a security flaw.
[00:45:12.649 --> 00:45:20.639]  Nissan shut down one of its smartphone apps this week after an Australian software developer found that Leaf owners were highly vulnerable to data theft and
[00:45:20.919 --> 00:45:21.219]  We're good.
[00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:52.510]  Okay, now it's not as bad, they point out, as the hacks of the Jeep Cherokee hack, which allowed them to control the car to drive it into another area.
[00:45:53.331 --> 00:46:02.360]  But, even as this is happening, there are articles throughout the web, especially this one from Forbes, saying that Volvo plans to be the first automaker to go fully keyless.
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.282]  They haven't learned a single thing.
[00:46:04.602 --> 00:46:10.228]  Say, Volvo just announced a move that should come as welcome news to those who habitually misplace their car keys.
[00:46:10.668 --> 00:46:12.230]  Oh, you won't need to have car keys.
[00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:18.296]  You can just use a smartphone app to unlock and to start your car and to do various other things with your car.
[00:46:18.436 --> 00:46:20.639]  Well, what happens if you can't keep track of your keys?
[00:46:20.939 --> 00:46:22.621]  Maybe you can't keep track of your smartphone.
[00:46:22.941 --> 00:46:26.103]  And maybe people can easily hack that smartphone.
[00:46:26.523 --> 00:46:42.792]  That's what we have to be concerned about with the Internet of Things, as well as the government using it as a surveillance and control grid to surveil our every movement, to tax, to track us, and to shut us down in terms of our ability to move around.
[00:46:43.332 --> 00:46:44.813]  Well, that's it for our news tonight.
[00:46:44.913 --> 00:46:49.576]  Coming up, we've got a surprise announcement from Alex Jones about the presidential race.
[00:46:49.596 --> 00:46:50.036]  Stay with us.
[00:46:59.019 --> 00:47:05.553]  It's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:47:05.794 --> 00:47:07.898]  You better believe you got one!
[00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:19.333]  Worst things with most energy products, this is not sustainable, right?
[00:47:19.353 --> 00:47:21.715]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.075 --> 00:47:25.578]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.638 --> 00:47:28.801]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.281 --> 00:47:34.085]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.251]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.228 --> 00:48:42.748]  Alex Jones here.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.523]  Most of you know me from Infowars.com, the syndicated radio show TV.
[00:49:15.524 --> 00:49:17.225]  I was skeptical about Trump a year ago.
[00:49:17.245 --> 00:49:22.530]  I admired him as a capitalist, but I had a lot of questions.
[00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:28.995]  In the last six months, I began to support him because a lot of the stances he was taking as a nationalist for sovereignty.
[00:49:29.035 --> 00:49:34.580]  But in the last few months, some things have happened and I really was just thinking on it last night, this morning and today.
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:41.583]  That have been happening with Donald Trump, and that's why I've decided I've got to come out against Trump 100%.
[00:49:42.943 --> 00:49:47.446]  And I'm sorry to all my listeners and everybody, some of which weren't for Trump, that I tried to convince you to be for him.
[00:49:48.106 --> 00:49:50.988]  I'm going to lay out a case right now of why you've got 100% opposing, okay?
[00:49:51.108 --> 00:49:53.489]  And I'm going to do that right now.
[00:49:54.550 --> 00:50:05.776]  I want to apologize, not just you, the viewers, but Rachel Maddow, people like Hillary Clinton, people like Obama.
[00:50:06.957 --> 00:50:07.878]  Vicente Fox, everybody.
[00:50:07.898 --> 00:50:08.959]  I'm just going to apologize to all of you.
[00:50:08.979 --> 00:50:09.660]  I'm going to say it right now.
[00:50:11.561 --> 00:50:13.423]  Donald Trump is a horrible person.
[00:50:13.583 --> 00:50:16.026]  He's against slave labor in China.
[00:50:16.987 --> 00:50:20.250]  He's against the suicide nets at Foxconn, Apple factories.
[00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:27.637]  He's against the fact that they hold their currency down low as a tariff against our goods and are totally ripping off America and the Chinese government.
[00:50:27.777 --> 00:50:29.679]  They came out and they said to Americans,
[00:50:30.299 --> 00:50:32.763]  You will not elect him or we'll come after you financially.
[00:50:33.144 --> 00:50:35.388]  You do not elect Donald Trump.
[00:50:35.648 --> 00:50:40.096]  We're a foreign government, a dictatorship, and we're telling you who you elect.
[00:50:40.116 --> 00:50:42.059]  And I just thought, my God, that's true.
[00:50:42.079 --> 00:50:44.002]  I'm a guilt-ridden American, a piece of filth.
[00:50:45.922 --> 00:50:48.803]  And it's true, I should be bossed around by a foreign government.
[00:50:49.223 --> 00:50:55.885]  Just like when the British government said they're looking at not letting him build hotels and golf courses there and never letting him come back to the UK.
[00:50:56.225 --> 00:51:05.348]  And then Vicente Fox with his drug dealer brother, other great people, comes out and says, you know, F you, your wall, America, you don't do this, telling us what to do.
[00:51:05.428 --> 00:51:06.449]  That's what this is all about.
[00:51:06.469 --> 00:51:11.330]  I mean, sure, Mexico's got a southern wall and some of the most draconian controls in the world, but that's okay for them.
[00:51:11.731 --> 00:51:12.571]  We can't have any.
[00:51:13.311 --> 00:51:17.834]  I agree with Obama, just bring folks in, just give them fake IDs, let them vote, give them everything free.
[00:51:17.874 --> 00:51:18.895]  I mean, screw Trump.
[00:51:19.335 --> 00:51:20.116]  What is he thinking?
[00:51:20.876 --> 00:51:22.618]  And it gets worse.
[00:51:22.698 --> 00:51:25.019]  The Davos group of top globals came out against him.
[00:51:25.379 --> 00:51:28.922]  All these groups came out and said, you will not vote for Trump.
[00:51:28.962 --> 00:51:30.343]  Obama said he's ineligible.
[00:51:31.143 --> 00:51:32.404]  He's disqualified, was the quote.
[00:51:32.864 --> 00:51:33.344]  And I agree.
[00:51:33.384 --> 00:51:38.106]  I love somebody telling me, like China, or the president, or a foreign president, what I can and can't do.
[00:51:38.206 --> 00:51:39.306]  Yes, sir, you're right.
[00:51:39.606 --> 00:51:43.467]  I'll even use the language you say with political correctness and won't use the words mother or father.
[00:51:44.168 --> 00:51:45.148]  This is totally normal.
[00:51:45.368 --> 00:51:47.529]  I agree and I apologize for supporting Trump.
[00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:51.230]  And then the Koch brothers came out and gave $75 million last Thursday.
[00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:52.550]  Politico was reporting on it.
[00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:53.671]  We talked to Roger Stone about it.
[00:51:54.511 --> 00:52:00.655]  To destroy Donald Trump, the guys that have taken over the Republican Party and made sure that it works for the Democrats to gut the nation.
[00:52:01.116 --> 00:52:04.078]  The RINOs, the neocons, they're totally against Trump.
[00:52:04.498 --> 00:52:08.601]  And then the Bush dynasty, the crime syndicates against Trump and said, oh, you can't have him for president.
[00:52:09.101 --> 00:52:15.966]  And the Clintons, with their hundreds of millions in speaking fees and Benghazi and all the rest of it, and the IRS persecuting people.
[00:52:16.286 --> 00:52:19.530]  Now, Donald Trump being audited over and over again for his political views.
[00:52:20.291 --> 00:52:22.553]  And if he didn't pay some taxes, that's what's bad.
[00:52:22.913 --> 00:52:24.095]  And I say put him in prison.
[00:52:24.675 --> 00:52:26.277]  And they showed no proof, but I don't care.
[00:52:26.297 --> 00:52:27.659]  They're now saying he has mob ties.
[00:52:28.179 --> 00:52:29.060]  But our government does.
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:30.061]  It's shipping the drugs in.
[00:52:30.101 --> 00:52:32.905]  So, it just really clicked for me.
[00:52:34.172 --> 00:52:39.999]  But one of the worst things was back in 2001, he left the Reform Party and their nomination because David Duke joined it.
[00:52:40.439 --> 00:52:43.222]  I mean, that is horrible that he was against David Duke.
[00:52:43.603 --> 00:52:45.545]  And then they said, oh, he won't repudiate David Duke.
[00:52:45.585 --> 00:52:50.250]  So he's bad for repudiating him, and then bad for not getting the audio and not repudiating him.
[00:52:50.951 --> 00:52:51.371]  So again,
[00:52:52.092 --> 00:52:52.993]  Talk about evil.
[00:52:53.053 --> 00:52:53.693]  Talk about bad.
[00:52:53.733 --> 00:52:55.494]  The fact that he's got no special interest money.
[00:52:55.875 --> 00:52:58.316]  The fact that hundreds of millions are being given to destroy him.
[00:52:58.496 --> 00:53:01.278]  The fact that all the big Republican and Democrat super PACs are against him.
[00:53:01.518 --> 00:53:05.381]  The fact that Mitch McConnell came out and other Republicans have said, we'll drop him like a hot rock.
[00:53:05.401 --> 00:53:06.382]  We're going to vote for Hillary.
[00:53:06.542 --> 00:53:07.582]  We want to lose the election.
[00:53:07.842 --> 00:53:08.783]  That's not a scandal.
[00:53:09.083 --> 00:53:09.864]  That's not bad.
[00:53:10.304 --> 00:53:15.928]  It isn't a sign that we should get behind Trump because the establishment that's already hijacked things and is running things into the ground.
[00:53:17.185 --> 00:53:17.786]  Is against him?
[00:53:18.126 --> 00:53:18.406]  No!
[00:53:18.707 --> 00:53:19.988]  I'm going to be politically correct.
[00:53:20.289 --> 00:53:22.671]  I'm going to feel like I'm successful even though I'm a chump.
[00:53:23.452 --> 00:53:27.236]  And I'm going to call for everyone to vote for Hillary Clinton.
[00:53:28.318 --> 00:53:32.342]  Or Bernie Sanders because those are such wonderlands under communism and socialism.
[00:53:32.382 --> 00:53:35.025]  And I'm going to get with the program and I'm not going to say he or she anymore.
[00:53:36.184 --> 00:53:39.629]  And I'm going to teach my children that boys and girls don't exist, they're purple penguins?
[00:53:40.129 --> 00:53:42.993]  And that it's good that they teach white guilt in all the schools and everything else?
[00:53:43.414 --> 00:53:48.200]  And just how dare him say that radical Muslims are chopping heads off and murdering and shooting things up?
[00:53:48.441 --> 00:53:50.483]  How dare he say until we vet these people?
[00:53:51.693 --> 00:53:54.054]  Alex, I can't listen to this anymore.
[00:53:54.154 --> 00:53:55.055]  What is wrong with you?
[00:53:55.415 --> 00:53:56.175]  Get it together!
[00:53:56.595 --> 00:53:59.056]  Since when do you let the establishment tell you how to think?
[00:53:59.456 --> 00:54:01.857]  Leanne, they said he was racist!
[00:54:01.997 --> 00:54:03.558]  You're talking all these lies!
[00:54:03.578 --> 00:54:05.679]  The Chinese government knows what they're doing!
[00:54:05.719 --> 00:54:08.840]  Hillary wears actual Chinese communist outfits in the debates!
[00:54:09.221 --> 00:54:10.621]  Get it together!
[00:54:10.641 --> 00:54:10.681]  No!
[00:54:11.521 --> 00:54:12.302]  You know something?
[00:54:13.539 --> 00:54:15.320]  I realize now that I've been wrong all along.
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:18.281]  When Melissa Harris Perry said that kids don't belong to their families, it's true.
[00:54:18.301 --> 00:54:20.781]  In fact, look at you wearing a skirt and shoes.
[00:54:20.882 --> 00:54:23.082]  That hurts women that don't think of themselves as women.
[00:54:23.482 --> 00:54:24.603]  You've completely lost it.
[00:54:24.763 --> 00:54:26.583]  The establishment, what have they done?
[00:54:26.924 --> 00:54:27.664]  Listen, listen.
[00:54:28.024 --> 00:54:32.705]  I'm trendy, I'm liberal, and I have moral superiority as a social justice warrior, and down with Trump!
[00:54:33.026 --> 00:54:33.986]  You're freaking out!
[00:54:35.276 --> 00:54:36.136]  You lost it!
[00:54:36.236 --> 00:54:38.417]  As a woman, I identify as a woman now.
[00:54:39.257 --> 00:54:41.178]  That is a man attacking me right there.
[00:54:41.378 --> 00:54:42.038]  Look at this!
[00:54:42.578 --> 00:54:42.898]  Okay?
[00:54:42.998 --> 00:54:43.118]  Ah!
[00:54:43.138 --> 00:54:43.839]  Confederate flag!
[00:54:43.859 --> 00:54:45.039]  Jesus!
[00:54:45.919 --> 00:54:51.161]  The establishment, they didn't ask Hillary Clinton about this pin from the 90s, Clinton and Gore.
[00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:53.082]  You're a racist for even having that symbol!
[00:54:53.122 --> 00:54:53.883]  I'm calling the police!
[00:54:53.923 --> 00:54:54.863]  Wait, wait, wait.
[00:54:54.943 --> 00:54:57.305]  They're allowed to have rebel flags in their advertisements.
[00:54:57.485 --> 00:54:57.705]  Yeah.
[00:54:57.845 --> 00:55:02.048]  Look, isn't it good to have all these foreign governments and the big mega banks that run everything and have screwed everything up?
[00:55:02.108 --> 00:55:04.069]  I mean, are helping us, attacking him?
[00:55:04.109 --> 00:55:05.690]  Doesn't that show he's a bad person?
[00:55:06.291 --> 00:55:06.731]  No!
[00:55:07.311 --> 00:55:09.092]  See, I was not even for Donald Trump.
[00:55:09.193 --> 00:55:14.856]  I'm like, this guy, you know, he's basically cutting out the middleman if you want to elect him.
[00:55:14.956 --> 00:55:18.679]  And then I saw how much the establishment was coming after him and attacking him.
[00:55:18.739 --> 00:55:19.099]  No, I forgot.
[00:55:19.159 --> 00:55:20.440]  And now they're like, take him out.
[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:29.865]  He came out and said the admitted 28 pages that Saudi Arabia was involved and that attacking Iraq was wrong and we lied about WMDs.
[00:55:30.145 --> 00:55:30.885]  How dare him?
[00:55:30.925 --> 00:55:34.487]  And then he said we should look at vaccines and all this other stuff.
[00:55:34.547 --> 00:55:35.288]  I mean, what is this?
[00:55:35.848 --> 00:55:37.068]  Why are you for him?
[00:55:37.369 --> 00:55:38.469]  Exactly, Alex.
[00:55:38.669 --> 00:55:39.350]  What is the problem?
[00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:39.970]  Listen, I'm not.
[00:55:40.310 --> 00:55:41.371]  I'm going against Trump.
[00:55:41.411 --> 00:55:42.891]  You have completely lost it.
[00:55:48.465 --> 00:55:50.547]  I'm calling the police on you.
[00:55:50.927 --> 00:55:52.568]  You don't have free speech anymore.
[00:55:52.928 --> 00:55:53.609]  I'm out of here, folks.
[00:55:53.649 --> 00:55:54.750]  I'm telling you right now, it's sick.
[00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:56.511]  It's sick and I've had enough of her.
[00:55:57.091 --> 00:55:58.673]  Ladies and gentlemen, down with Trump!
[00:55:58.753 --> 00:56:01.474]  Yeah, open the borders up!
[00:56:02.075 --> 00:56:06.738]  It's okay for them to say, for those that are erased everything, those that are erased nothing, down with the devil!
[00:56:08.199 --> 00:56:08.800]  Good Lord!
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:11.241]  Look, notice it's white like a Klan sheet.
[00:56:11.301 --> 00:56:11.822]  Get over here!
[00:56:12.382 --> 00:56:13.303]  This is a Klan sheet!
[00:56:14.844 --> 00:56:16.185]  Leanne McAdoo, that is unbelievable.
[00:56:16.205 --> 00:56:17.487]  I'm trying to break through the conditioning.
[00:56:17.647 --> 00:56:17.987]  That's it!
[00:56:18.027 --> 00:56:19.028]  I don't support Trump anymore.
[00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:20.830]  It's so obvious.
[00:56:21.171 --> 00:56:22.372]  The whole power structure is right.
[00:56:22.872 --> 00:56:23.533]  They care about us.
[00:56:23.673 --> 00:56:26.857]  InfoWars.com forward slash show to find all the anti-Trump coverage.
[00:56:26.877 --> 00:56:28.699]  And you, you are fired.
[00:56:29.419 --> 00:56:30.000]  No, no, that's it.
[00:56:31.401 --> 00:56:32.202]  I quit.
[00:56:32.242 --> 00:56:32.923]  You're the one that helped.
[00:56:32.943 --> 00:56:33.864]  You didn't used to like Trump.
[00:56:33.884 --> 00:56:34.805]  You're joining the establishment.
[00:56:34.825 --> 00:56:35.266]  I'm out of here.
[00:56:35.286 --> 00:56:36.267]  You didn't used to like Trump.
[00:56:36.986 --> 00:56:37.566]  I'm out of here.
[00:56:37.586 --> 00:56:40.468]  If you're joining the establishment... I'm not!
[00:56:40.548 --> 00:56:41.769]  I'm fighting the racist!
[00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:43.050]  He has blonde hair!
[00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:46.012]  You just said you were gonna vote for Hillary Clinton!
[00:56:46.212 --> 00:56:48.773]  She is a woman and cares about the children.
[00:56:49.834 --> 00:56:53.876]  Even though she called black people super predators and said they need to be healed like dogs, it doesn't matter.
[00:56:54.357 --> 00:57:00.700]  Even though she came out and said Robert Byrd, a notable Ku Klux Klan man... The head of the Ku Klux Klan nationwide, it's okay when they do it.
[00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:05.003]  Yeah, she came out and praised him as her mentor, who she cares so much about, Robert Byrd, but that's fine.
[00:57:05.503 --> 00:57:06.344]  Oh my God!
[00:57:06.904 --> 00:57:07.464]  Oh my God!
[00:57:07.504 --> 00:57:08.645]  More racism!
[00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:10.105]  More racism!
[00:57:10.245 --> 00:57:11.326]  I am morally superior!
[00:57:11.526 --> 00:57:12.507]  Your facts don't matter!
[00:57:12.807 --> 00:57:13.167]  Racist!
[00:57:13.587 --> 00:57:13.947]  Racist!
[00:57:14.347 --> 00:57:14.688]  Racist!
[00:57:15.088 --> 00:57:15.428]  Racist!
[00:57:15.448 --> 00:57:19.790]  I agree with the people that are banning Halloween nationwide at Harvard and Yale where they fire their professors.
[00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:21.671]  They put emails out saying we should have free speech.
[00:57:22.131 --> 00:57:22.972]  No free speech!
[00:57:23.192 --> 00:57:24.772]  Unless it's approved by the government!
[00:57:26.391 --> 00:57:28.072]  Roar!
[00:57:28.112 --> 00:57:29.634]  Donald Trump is the enemy!
[00:57:31.415 --> 00:57:32.116]  How dare you?
[00:57:32.496 --> 00:57:33.136]  How dare you?
[00:57:33.177 --> 00:57:33.957]  I'm not listening anymore.
[00:57:34.257 --> 00:57:34.618]  Stop!
[00:57:34.838 --> 00:57:36.479]  We're building you a safe space!
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:37.520]  I can't fight back.
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:37.920]  It's liberal.
[00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:38.681]  I can't fight back.
[00:57:38.921 --> 00:57:41.203]  Oh wait, I'm supposed to... Wait, they said I'm being attacked.
[00:57:41.243 --> 00:57:42.984]  I roll over and I pee on myself.
[00:57:43.004 --> 00:57:43.485]  That's liberal.
[00:57:43.665 --> 00:57:44.045]  Hold on.
[00:57:44.245 --> 00:57:47.228]  Hold on.
[00:57:47.288 --> 00:57:48.869]  This makes you stop the assault.
[00:57:49.269 --> 00:57:50.190]  I'm a liberal now.
[00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:51.031]  I'm a liberal.
[00:57:53.402 --> 00:57:55.143]  I can't do it anymore.
[00:57:55.203 --> 00:57:59.486]  That illustrates how absurd all this Donald Trump attack is.
[00:57:59.686 --> 00:58:01.928]  Can you believe he said we should have a border?
[00:58:02.528 --> 00:58:04.529]  Can you believe they said mother and father?
[00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:06.291]  Can you believe?
[00:58:06.311 --> 00:58:08.472]  That was fun.
[00:58:08.852 --> 00:58:10.954]  So am I actually fired?
[00:58:11.154 --> 00:58:14.376]  No, that was all theater in case folks get confused.
[00:58:15.367 --> 00:58:16.308]  That's it for the nightly news.
[00:58:16.368 --> 00:58:17.649]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:58:17.669 --> 00:58:18.149]  Great job, Lynn.
[00:58:18.169 --> 00:58:19.430]  You're actually going to do a man on the street right now.
[00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:20.191]  I'm being politically incorrect.
[00:58:20.231 --> 00:58:20.831]  Or a woman on the street.
[00:58:21.051 --> 00:58:25.355]  I just want to find out how people feel about the lecture fest that was the Oscars last night.
[00:58:25.395 --> 00:58:35.522]  They got lectured for four hours about racism, white privilege, climate change, sexual assault, widespread sexual assault on campus.
[00:58:35.582 --> 00:58:36.243]  I mean, for four
[00:58:36.727 --> 00:58:38.729]  It was like a Soviet brainwashing program.
[00:58:38.749 --> 00:58:39.229]  Seriously!
[00:58:39.269 --> 00:58:41.130]  It's like a giant re-education camp.
[00:58:41.330 --> 00:58:43.932]  You really want to change the world, just, you know, go join politics.
[00:58:43.972 --> 00:58:46.674]  Don't get in your private... I watched about an hour and I had to turn it off.
[00:58:47.335 --> 00:58:47.935]  It's awful.
[00:58:48.136 --> 00:58:51.918]  It's like a big propaganda... And carbon tax, but DiCaprio's flying around with jets everywhere.
[00:58:52.219 --> 00:58:52.939]  Great job, Leigh-Anne.
[00:58:52.959 --> 00:58:55.181]  Get out there, do your person on the street and be politically correct now.
[00:58:55.681 --> 00:58:56.402]  Down with Trump!
[00:58:56.442 --> 00:58:57.142]  Great job, folks.
[00:58:57.222 --> 00:58:57.923]  That's it for the Nightly News.
[00:59:03.843 --> 00:59:05.004]  Knockout is back.
[00:59:05.344 --> 00:59:16.448]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep, restful sleep, Knockout's it.
