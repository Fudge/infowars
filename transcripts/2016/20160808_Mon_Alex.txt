[00:00:12.096 --> 00:00:19.538]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:00:40.134 --> 00:00:49.142]  Out of the hundreds of incredibly important stories I have lying before me today, the first one I want to cover opens the theme.
[00:00:50.463 --> 00:00:51.944]  I don't set the theme here, Daley.
[00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:58.269]  What is basically openly being thrown in our face is what sets the theme.
[00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.772]  We are in a completely gamed system.
[00:01:01.792 --> 00:01:04.455]  The stock market, the currency rates,
[00:01:06.496 --> 00:01:21.483]  The interest rates, I would have economic guests on, many of them have been the top folks in their field, like Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster in the late great, and they would talk about how the markets were rigged specifically.
[00:01:22.343 --> 00:01:27.366]  And then it came out years later that exactly what he said and others talked about was totally true.
[00:01:27.846 --> 00:01:28.926]  They rigged the unemployment.
[00:01:29.126 --> 00:01:29.907]  They rigged the
[00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.155]  Numbers that come in on inflation, it's all rigged and it's getting more overtly rigged.
[00:01:41.558 --> 00:01:57.271]  Now I got up this morning and saw the New York Times unveiling Alexa, an Amazon company that will control every device in your house for your convenience.
[00:01:57.591 --> 00:01:59.272]  It'll be like Siri, but 2.0.
[00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:03.843]  And of course, they admit that they've merged.
[00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:05.124]  This is admitted!
[00:02:05.464 --> 00:02:08.046]  Amazon.com with the CIA and the NSA.
[00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:20.456]  And then on top of it, two years ago, in the middle of October, Alexa was mainly an internet traffic rating site.
[00:02:20.556 --> 00:02:25.540]  And we could look at our Google Analytics and look at our own servers and see that it was pretty accurate.
[00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:28.602]  It would operate off people that basically had
[00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:33.740]  Dashboards, or visit Alexa, then it would put cookies on your computer to track where you went.
[00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:48.315]  And after we first reported on it, WorldNetDaily and others confirmed that thousands of libertarian and conservative sites, including DrudgeReport.com, had their ratings brought down 80% on one day.
[00:02:48.796 --> 00:02:50.818]  Amazon didn't even lazily
[00:02:55.134 --> 00:02:58.696]  You know, just slowly, where it's not noticeable, lower us.
[00:02:59.276 --> 00:03:00.217]  They just did it overnight.
[00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:12.603]  Now, we can sit there, and we've shown people these graphs with our internal stats and Google programs, and show our traffic exploding, but you can just see that in the news.
[00:03:14.044 --> 00:03:15.965]  You can see that in bumper stickers all over the country.
[00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:24.370]  You can see that with the Late Show talking trash about us and other major programs on a daily basis.
[00:03:27.028 --> 00:03:31.711]  But it's indicative of the total rigging of society and civilization.
[00:03:35.833 --> 00:03:45.539]  Now, advertisers operate off of results, so it doesn't matter if the supposed major rating service is cooking everything because people know they're getting results.
[00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.000]  But this is what's crazy.
[00:03:48.321 --> 00:03:53.824]  They didn't just cut our visitors by 80% in one day and then never bring it back up.
[00:03:56.118 --> 00:04:00.063]  I mean, you see the spikes, but it's brought down into a valley.
[00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:10.698]  They then gave an 80% boost on average to every communist, socialist, or democrat site.
[00:04:12.054 --> 00:04:29.521]  Mass criminal racketeering organized crime to direct the economy through a technocracy to socialist and communist and establishment Goldman Sachs approved type media outlets and websites and commerce sites.
[00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:38.665]  This is Amazon that wants to be over global commerce that's being raided all over the world as we speak from Japan to Germany for running trust, running monopolies.
[00:04:39.725 --> 00:04:54.220]  Best buddies with Obama and they're engaged in trying to create a monopoly here domestically, not just of products, but to literally defraud us and not let us get advertisers.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.582]  Criminal assault!
[00:04:57.883 --> 00:05:00.086]  And the reason I bring up this theme is, here's the next article.
[00:05:01.053 --> 00:05:07.882]  Infowars.com, ABC cuts live stream when Trump starts talking about Hillary's support for ISIS.
[00:05:08.623 --> 00:05:09.504]  It's system-wide.
[00:05:10.545 --> 00:05:17.514]  Weren't you proud of how optimistic, upbeat, positive, pro-America, the convention was here and the message...
[00:05:26.874 --> 00:05:28.818]  What do you think about Hillary Clinton?
[00:05:36.624 --> 00:05:38.604]  What gives you hope that she's going to fight this?
[00:05:38.765 --> 00:05:47.027]  So, that's the thing, is that I don't have much hope that she is, but what it is now, with Bernie's endorsement, he's done all he can to help her win.
[00:05:47.067 --> 00:05:48.247]  We won't vote for Hillary, out of the DNC!
[00:05:48.267 --> 00:05:49.567]  We won't vote for Hillary, out of the DNC!
[00:05:49.587 --> 00:05:50.967]  We won't vote for Hillary, out of the DNC!
[00:05:50.987 --> 00:05:52.208]  We won't vote for Hillary, out of the DNC!
[00:05:52.228 --> 00:05:53.748]  We won't vote for Hillary, out of the DNC!
[00:05:53.788 --> 00:05:55.068]  We won't vote for Hillary, out of the DNC!
[00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:56.129]  We won't vote for Hillary, out of the DNC!
[00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:57.409]  We won't vote for Hillary, out of the DNC!
[00:05:57.429 --> 00:05:58.369]  We won't vote for Hillary, out of the DNC!
[00:05:58.389 --> 00:05:59.690]  We won't vote for Hillary, out of the DNC!
[00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.750]  We won't vote for Hillary, out of the DNC!
[00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.131]  We won't vote for Hillary, out of the DNC!
[00:06:04.151 --> 00:06:05.451]  We won't vote for Hillary, out of the DNC!
[00:06:05.471 --> 00:06:05.531]  We
[00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.913]  I want to understand they're not going to have any families of policemen who have been killed.
[00:06:12.933 --> 00:06:14.294]  What are your comments about that?
[00:06:14.414 --> 00:06:24.283]  I wish we could share the pain of both.
[00:06:24.363 --> 00:06:28.446]  It was verified that there was a special access program on that information.
[00:06:28.767 --> 00:06:29.487]  That there was.
[00:06:29.687 --> 00:06:33.130]  That's so top secret we're not even supposed to know about it.
[00:06:34.651 --> 00:06:38.913]  Our geospatial information was on that server.
[00:06:39.514 --> 00:06:41.615]  That's our nuclear intelligence.
[00:06:42.295 --> 00:06:46.397]  That's our satellite imaging of where we know nuclear weapons are.
[00:06:47.278 --> 00:06:55.261]  This is the perfect example of how a white, privileged male can speak over a non-binary, trans female.
[00:06:55.421 --> 00:07:00.864]  This is the perfect example of cultural Marxism at its best.
[00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:02.465]  Ask him if he deserved to be spit on.
[00:07:06.136 --> 00:07:06.979]  And it was so funny.
[00:07:08.023 --> 00:07:10.875]  And it was so funny that I didn't spit it.
[00:07:20.421 --> 00:07:40.267]  Hillary Clinton, who was handling thousands of emails, instructing people to remove classification so they could send it, is allowed to keep her security clearance, is allowed to continue to run for president.
[00:07:40.427 --> 00:07:43.568]  She's going to be getting a security briefing if she wins a nomination.
[00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:45.829]  She'll be getting security briefings at the end of this week.
[00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:46.649]  How do you feel about that?
[00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:52.834]  I feel that I can trust her to be the most competent president that we can have at this time.
[00:07:53.355 --> 00:08:06.245]  She is trustworthy in the fact that she is competent, she is knowledgeable, she has the right demeanor, the presence of mind, and I think that's where her trustworthiness is.
[00:08:14.006 --> 00:08:24.130]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.710]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:08:39.563 --> 00:08:40.603]  Poisoning!
[00:08:40.643 --> 00:08:46.987]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:09:08.029 --> 00:09:10.010]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.771]  We've got a bunch of special guests joining us.
[00:09:11.811 --> 00:09:19.496]  We have the individual in a close race with the Speaker of the House joining us and more today.
[00:09:21.137 --> 00:09:27.962]  But before I go any further, let me just break down the facts.
[00:09:29.883 --> 00:09:37.188]  If you go read the press releases of the Bilderberg Group, if you go read the press releases and statements and mission statements,
[00:09:39.051 --> 00:09:51.058]  of organizations like Davos, that is just a public Bilderberg Group meeting, quasi-public, they tell you, we are technocrats, setting up a technocratic, technotronic world.
[00:09:52.879 --> 00:10:01.024]  The first person to call it that, well, they had the technocrat movement back in the 20s and 30s, but the first person to call that in modern times was Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[00:10:02.404 --> 00:10:08.568]  And he's one of the top global architects in the last 50 years in this country, and is still in charge to a great extent.
[00:10:10.535 --> 00:10:19.537]  I've read six of his books, where he calmly talks about how he manipulated the Khmer Rouge to kill 30% of the Cambodian population.
[00:10:19.897 --> 00:10:21.017]  Now he's quite proud of that.
[00:10:22.297 --> 00:10:29.599]  He now makes statements at the Council on Foreign Relations that we've played many times, where he says it's easier just to wipe out the population now than to control them.
[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:38.561]  Technocracies are gamed economies that take royalty to the next level.
[00:10:39.415 --> 00:10:48.685]  Under ancient hereditary royalty, the king is the law, the king is above the law, the king owns everything including the population.
[00:10:49.246 --> 00:10:51.869]  It's called feudalism, a fancy term for slavery.
[00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.992]  The best slaves don't know they're slaves.
[00:10:58.496 --> 00:10:59.197]  And they are
[00:11:01.514 --> 00:11:09.121]  Dazzled by the fancy regalia and the banners and the horns and the big Clydesdale horses of the royalty and the jewels.
[00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:16.308]  It must be their right to rule over us or they wouldn't be in power.
[00:11:16.528 --> 00:11:17.829]  The divine right of kings.
[00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:23.615]  Now that said, this new system has been established.
[00:11:24.738 --> 00:11:35.462]  Where the major hedge funds, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and others, now in the last three years were given global diplomatic immunity by the United Nations from all crime.
[00:11:39.763 --> 00:11:43.164]  They have established systems where they admit they rigged the stock market.
[00:11:46.045 --> 00:11:48.806]  95% of the trades, that's mainstream news, are completely rigged, totally fake.
[00:11:48.926 --> 00:11:51.387]  Just all computerized, all staged, like a fake casino.
[00:11:52.027 --> 00:11:54.388]  The currency rates globally, totally staged, every day.
[00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:00.474]  The insurance rates, staged.
[00:12:02.615 --> 00:12:03.776]  The interest rates, staged.
[00:12:03.916 --> 00:12:05.457]  All staged, all admitted to be staged.
[00:12:07.298 --> 00:12:10.280]  They've gone from a decade denying it to just, yes, we staged everything.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.020]  Now move along.
[00:12:14.222 --> 00:12:17.764]  The New York Times came out in an article yesterday.
[00:12:18.544 --> 00:12:20.585]  Billy Corgan sent me this this morning and said, have you seen this?
[00:12:20.605 --> 00:12:24.528]  And I said, no, but I've seen the same talking point a hundred places last week.
[00:12:25.909 --> 00:12:28.090]  And it's, we need to go ahead and lie about Donald Trump?
[00:12:29.636 --> 00:12:31.657]  We need to go ahead and maybe take the election from him.
[00:12:33.258 --> 00:12:35.840]  New York Times writer said a few months before that, we need to just kill him.
[00:12:36.741 --> 00:12:38.001]  Somebody needs to put a bullet in him, he said.
[00:12:38.021 --> 00:12:45.666]  And you read the article, and it says, look, it's our moral duty to lie about Trump, we're liberals, and it's just something we have to do.
[00:12:48.048 --> 00:12:49.048]  Here it is, Amazon.
[00:12:52.429 --> 00:12:55.692]  Has big plans for Alexa running the Star Trek home.
[00:12:55.712 --> 00:12:56.933]  That's another New York Times article.
[00:12:57.513 --> 00:12:59.875]  And it's written like it's fun and it's cute.
[00:13:01.116 --> 00:13:04.819]  And it's going to be voice activated and run all your appliances and everything in your home.
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.382]  And it's called Alexa.
[00:13:14.387 --> 00:13:15.608]  And the program is called Echo.
[00:13:18.154 --> 00:13:23.456]  Now, it was the dream of Al Gore and Ken Lay in the early 1990s.
[00:13:24.857 --> 00:13:33.621]  They developed it in the late 1980s, but went public in the early 1990s with a global carbon tax plan to control all life, track everything, but selectively tax so you could shut down all competition.
[00:13:33.661 --> 00:13:40.424]  That's the real holy grail of this new royalty that's above the law.
[00:13:41.357 --> 00:13:46.058]  But by us using their computer systems, they're then able to game the economy even more.
[00:13:46.078 --> 00:13:54.661]  And they talked about thermostats, smart meters in all your houses, that will also monitor and run and control all your other appliances, even if you didn't like it.
[00:13:56.782 --> 00:14:03.064]  And they said as long as it's ubiquitous, our psychologists have found, and already in all the homes, they will opt in.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.463]  To these systems, but even if they don't, the average person is so busy.
[00:14:09.003 --> 00:14:13.467]  They talk about us like they're Martians, looking at us under a microscope, you know, planning to invade.
[00:14:13.787 --> 00:14:15.228]  Like the intro of H.G.
[00:14:15.248 --> 00:14:16.069]  Wells' War of the Worlds.
[00:14:16.469 --> 00:14:17.470]  Not the movie, but the book.
[00:14:18.211 --> 00:14:20.192]  They coldly, from space, watched us.
[00:14:21.253 --> 00:14:21.854]  And prepared.
[00:14:21.894 --> 00:14:25.737]  And in fact, will you guys print me the intro to War of the Worlds?
[00:14:25.757 --> 00:14:26.698]  Because that's what it is.
[00:14:27.178 --> 00:14:29.840]  And I don't mean aliens, but the elite act just like it.
[00:14:30.201 --> 00:14:32.763]  And I'm just sitting here, watching them build it all around us,
[00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:42.836]  Just like I told you 18 years ago that the new TVs and cable boxes had microphones and cameras and I would bust them open on television and show you.
[00:14:45.558 --> 00:14:49.501]  And then all hell would break loose days after.
[00:14:51.403 --> 00:14:55.086]  Death threats, attacks, hell on earth, whenever I would get to that.
[00:14:55.486 --> 00:14:57.228]  Because you weren't supposed to know at that point.
[00:14:57.588 --> 00:14:59.810]  Now, CNN, your TV is watching you.
[00:15:00.706 --> 00:15:05.007]  Samsung TVs tell you, watch what you say, we're watching you, and sell them the data right now.
[00:15:08.148 --> 00:15:19.671]  Whether it's AT&T, or whether it's Samsung, whether it's a digital provider or the device itself, all of them are making money selling it into the grid.
[00:15:22.622 --> 00:15:23.623]  Now what am I getting at here?
[00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:27.727]  Because I've got all this other incredible news, but here's what's happening in 2016.
[00:15:28.047 --> 00:15:34.253]  Just as Matt Drudge was told a year ago by a Supreme Court Justice, just as he came here to warn us on air and no one else.
[00:15:39.118 --> 00:15:41.100]  This is the year they turn it all on.
[00:15:43.117 --> 00:15:52.085]  Two years ago, Alexa, in one day, delisted thousands of libertarian, conservative, Christian, and veterans group and Second Amendment sites.
[00:15:52.205 --> 00:15:58.990]  In one day, Alexa, the global rating service, supposedly of internet traffic, brought us down 80%.
[00:16:00.872 --> 00:16:06.036]  Now, we went and showed on Infowars.com article, our internal Google track stats that are live.
[00:16:07.558 --> 00:16:10.300]  Not just some sampling that, you know, the Democrat Bezos puts out.
[00:16:12.918 --> 00:16:13.238]  Okay.
[00:16:15.899 --> 00:16:23.902]  And we were actually climbing at that point, and so was basically all other libertarian conservative media, while MSNBC, CNN, they were all dropping.
[00:16:24.322 --> 00:16:28.904]  So they didn't just drop us 80%, they lifted them 80%, sometimes 100%.
[00:16:30.605 --> 00:16:31.765]  So the graphs went like this.
[00:16:32.245 --> 00:16:33.586]  Globalist media straight up.
[00:16:35.186 --> 00:16:36.427]  Patriot media straight down.
[00:16:38.482 --> 00:16:41.483]  Now ladies and gentlemen, this has continued and intensified.
[00:16:41.523 --> 00:16:50.108]  Now in the real world, you see our bumper stickers everywhere, you see our links everywhere, you see the videos everywhere, you see all of this.
[00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:53.609]  So they have inversed these.
[00:16:54.029 --> 00:16:56.871]  MSNBC goes straight up, we go straight down.
[00:16:58.672 --> 00:17:01.953]  Now you notice even though they cut us down, we still keep going up because we're growing so fast.
[00:17:03.294 --> 00:17:04.995]  They just sloppily turned us down 80%.
[00:17:06.425 --> 00:17:13.908]  But then if you look at a five-year graph, we've now climbed back up above that because we're really much, many times higher than what they're even saying.
[00:17:14.528 --> 00:17:15.688]  But here's the next level.
[00:17:17.229 --> 00:17:25.592]  These are the people that are going to basically give you a device, but you just pay for the service, a little robot that sits in your house.
[00:17:26.752 --> 00:17:28.093]  It is an imperial probe droid.
[00:17:29.833 --> 00:17:36.534]  And it's jacking into everything, stealing everything, and running your life, and you talk to it, it's your new family member.
[00:17:37.154 --> 00:17:37.955]  What a joke!
[00:17:37.975 --> 00:17:43.396]  I mean, you think it's bad with Zuckerberg calling his users dumb effers, or Drudge saying, you know, remember when we were still human?
[00:17:43.696 --> 00:17:45.936]  Feel the air, you know, feel the water, walk in the woods.
[00:17:46.296 --> 00:17:52.817]  Remember when it showed all his minions wearing the goggles, seated, with virtual reality as he walks by them as the super predator?
[00:17:52.837 --> 00:17:55.638]  Remember that photo, a few months ago?
[00:17:57.662 --> 00:18:24.629]  So it's across the board where Amazon is the biggest commerce site in the world, bigger than Walmart, with overall sales, bigger than Walmart, and it's going to game everything and have a device in your house that runs and tracks everything that you talk to, that's like it's your husband or wife, and they're involved in monopoly and trust actions all over the world creating monopolies.
[00:18:26.405 --> 00:18:31.209]  And they're involved creating monopolies saying no one else is getting traffic they politically don't agree with.
[00:18:31.249 --> 00:18:36.033]  That's the equivalent of the Germans first in 1936-37 closing Jewish shops.
[00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:38.115]  First you turn off the money of the people.
[00:18:39.776 --> 00:18:45.701]  Well, what Amazon and Zuckerberg and everybody is doing is direct siege economic warfare.
[00:18:47.315 --> 00:18:51.999]  Just like they won't give veterans groups or Christian groups or other charities 501c3s.
[00:18:52.019 --> 00:18:54.982]  They won't give one out, but give Democrats tens of thousands a year.
[00:18:55.142 --> 00:19:00.206]  And then they go and they prosecute and persecute the other organizations that already had their tax exemptions.
[00:19:01.207 --> 00:19:04.750]  This is a dangerous, dangerous, dangerous reign of terror.
[00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:08.033]  And what I'm getting at here today, I'm going to skip a separate break, is that
[00:19:12.014 --> 00:19:14.116]  The next phases are about to come into place.
[00:19:14.156 --> 00:19:21.602]  We've already seen them in Germany, and seen them in France, and seen them in China, where they are, quote, banning internet news, period, in China.
[00:19:22.963 --> 00:19:24.884]  Even banning mainstream news online.
[00:19:25.505 --> 00:19:26.525]  That was the headline last week.
[00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:28.647]  China bans news online.
[00:19:30.108 --> 00:19:30.809]  And who works with them?
[00:19:30.829 --> 00:19:31.569]  Who's learning from them?
[00:19:31.649 --> 00:19:32.110]  Zuckerberg.
[00:19:33.571 --> 00:19:34.592]  Apple is one of the worst.
[00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:44.334]  Google, I believe, is even more evil, but understands they need to stay free and open longer, because that's what really dominates.
[00:19:45.254 --> 00:19:53.439]  And so they are still, to a certain extent, more free and more open, except for with the Trump stuff, censoring his name, not listing him as a presidential candidate, trying to block things.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:58.242]  There's Bloomberg, China bans internet news reporting as media crackdown widens.
[00:19:58.522 --> 00:20:05.827]  Now, that's already started in Europe, but it's just called political correctness, where they arrest you if you mildly criticize open borders.
[00:20:06.367 --> 00:20:07.488]  This is draconian.
[00:20:10.444 --> 00:20:11.924]  And so this is the internet ghettos.
[00:20:13.525 --> 00:20:26.608]  Now, the good news is InfoWars saw this coming four years ago and shifted from being subscriber-based, advertising-based, and private sales-based by us to moving more and more to private sales.
[00:20:28.049 --> 00:20:29.489]  And that's why we were able to continue on.
[00:20:29.569 --> 00:20:30.710]  Everybody else is struggling.
[00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:35.511]  Even as their traffic goes up, they're turning off the old online system.
[00:20:37.079 --> 00:20:37.859]  Of quote, clickbait.
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:43.122]  And most organizations are so bare bones, they don't know how to do other forms of advertising.
[00:20:45.804 --> 00:20:46.524]  And other systems.
[00:20:47.365 --> 00:20:48.466]  I mean, it's dinosaur level.
[00:20:48.506 --> 00:20:57.931]  If I was running Clear Channel, and by the way, I've done, I don't wanna get into inside baseball, but I did as a test with a large Clear Channel outlet.
[00:20:59.192 --> 00:21:02.894]  We did a test and with my tweaking,
[00:21:05.051 --> 00:21:07.452]  It brought up an ad campaign's program 3,000%.
[00:21:09.333 --> 00:21:15.955]  Now you'd think Clear Channel would want that type of consulting.
[00:21:18.156 --> 00:21:21.878]  What I'm saying is, it's like the executives everywhere are zombies too now.
[00:21:22.038 --> 00:21:22.798]  It's not just the public.
[00:21:24.813 --> 00:21:31.878]  I mean, with only 170-something affiliates, most of them mom and pops, and the rest of them, we have built something nobody else has even got.
[00:21:31.998 --> 00:21:34.060]  Imagine if I had 600 radio stations.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:35.821]  The big marquees.
[00:21:36.021 --> 00:21:39.304]  If I had 20 of the top stations in the country, we'd take the whole country back.
[00:21:40.725 --> 00:21:42.526]  But see, it isn't about a level playing field.
[00:21:42.566 --> 00:21:43.847]  It's about controlling everything.
[00:21:45.356 --> 00:21:48.098]  And so what I'm getting at here is, they're not going to stop.
[00:21:48.779 --> 00:21:49.479]  Oh my gosh!
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:55.644]  A couple years ago, the major third-party site run by Amazon, Alexa.com,
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:04.843]  That yes, we used for advertising sales for more than 15 years to say, oh, you claim your Google Analytics show, you've got this many things.
[00:22:04.903 --> 00:22:05.383]  Sure you shouldn't.
[00:22:05.403 --> 00:22:06.083]  It's a screenshot.
[00:22:06.443 --> 00:22:07.684]  Well, Alexa.
[00:22:07.784 --> 00:22:08.364]  Oh, wow.
[00:22:08.464 --> 00:22:08.784]  Wow.
[00:22:08.804 --> 00:22:11.025]  You're like number 400 in the country.
[00:22:11.045 --> 00:22:13.365]  I see in places like England, you're like number 55.
[00:22:13.405 --> 00:22:14.106]  Wow.
[00:22:14.126 --> 00:22:16.927]  And man, that's incredible.
[00:22:16.947 --> 00:22:17.007]  Wow.
[00:22:19.608 --> 00:22:22.253]  As we start climbing, I mean by now we'd be like a hundred or something.
[00:22:22.854 --> 00:22:23.855]  What do they do?
[00:22:24.977 --> 00:22:27.301]  They just delist us and say it doesn't exist.
[00:22:27.602 --> 00:22:32.770]  The problem is we're still rampaging forward, growing like the blob in their eyes.
[00:22:35.475 --> 00:22:38.196]  So, so, so, they pretend to play this game.
[00:22:38.777 --> 00:22:53.864]  If I saw one, I saw 5,000, and I'm not kidding, I saw articles every day for years saying, Drudge is pathetic, Drudge has collapsed, Drudge doesn't have any traffic, Drudge isn't pertinent, Drudge doesn't matter anymore, no one visits Drudge, Drudge is a joke, Drudge is a fraud, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:22:54.204 --> 00:22:56.145]  And of course, Drudge was just growing, growing, growing, growing, growing, growing.
[00:22:56.165 --> 00:23:03.429]  The number one news aggregator, more than New York Times, Facebook, and NBC News, and all of them combined.
[00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:10.093]  And it's like two people who are just populist.
[00:23:11.034 --> 00:23:11.834]  So how do they deal with that?
[00:23:11.854 --> 00:23:13.756]  They're going to come in with the Federal Elections Commission.
[00:23:13.776 --> 00:23:16.037]  They're openly saying they want to go after drugs and everybody else.
[00:23:16.317 --> 00:23:19.379]  They're going to go in and just start not getting you passed through.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:25.263]  They're quietly ending net neutrality to many sites where your site just is slow and people can't get to it.
[00:23:26.226 --> 00:23:27.447]  They're announcing they're doing that.
[00:23:28.807 --> 00:23:30.468]  It's a whole cocktail, but I'm just telling you.
[00:23:30.828 --> 00:23:33.269]  You want to live in a banana republic, completely rigged?
[00:23:33.409 --> 00:23:34.670]  Baby, this is it.
[00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:40.212]  And then now they're going to have a little foot-tall, round, tubular robot.
[00:23:40.352 --> 00:23:40.912]  That's what it is.
[00:23:40.932 --> 00:23:46.515]  It had red eyes you wouldn't put at your house, but it's a little tube over there in the corner.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.142]  It's like if aliens arrived and said, here's this great technology, here, take it.
[00:23:50.382 --> 00:23:50.963]  Oh, thank you!
[00:23:51.143 --> 00:24:00.370]  And then it's a Trojan horse in your house to game and to track everything you do and to actuary a profile on you and then sell that data and then figure out how to screw you better.
[00:24:01.751 --> 00:24:02.491]  That's all admitted.
[00:24:04.313 --> 00:24:05.914]  They admit it's about screwing you.
[00:24:06.995 --> 00:24:08.516]  And sure, we sell stuff on Amazon.
[00:24:10.778 --> 00:24:12.339]  And I really think
[00:24:14.141 --> 00:24:15.962]  That I need to go file a lawsuit.
[00:24:15.982 --> 00:24:17.403]  Somebody's got to do it for antitrust.
[00:24:18.163 --> 00:24:20.925]  And point out what Amazon's doing on every end.
[00:24:21.745 --> 00:24:24.167]  Undercutting everybody to agree that it's not even free market.
[00:24:26.448 --> 00:24:27.509]  Controlling the internet.
[00:24:27.829 --> 00:24:28.830]  Delisting people.
[00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:32.092]  And implying they don't have traffic to destroy them.
[00:24:33.312 --> 00:24:39.316]  It's the equivalent of standing out front somebody's restaurant that's been around 20 years and it's the most popular in town.
[00:24:39.356 --> 00:24:40.777]  You're about to open yours down the street and you go,
[00:24:42.045 --> 00:24:45.648]  My son died of food poisoning in there and there's roaches as big as chihuahuas.
[00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:51.232]  And then going in there at night and throwing roach crap in the refrigerator and on the tables.
[00:24:52.273 --> 00:24:53.194]  This is sabotage.
[00:24:53.254 --> 00:24:57.157]  I mean, this is hardcore 21st century warfare.
[00:25:03.642 --> 00:25:07.065]  You know Trump's going to contest the election if they steal it and he would have had the votes.
[00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:09.390]  To get into the White House.
[00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:12.531]  If Scalia hadn't died, now he doesn't.
[00:25:14.311 --> 00:25:18.452]  What I'm telling you is, guys, can you queue up the State Department clip and give me the article on that?
[00:25:18.913 --> 00:25:20.553]  They have the head spokesman of the State Department.
[00:25:20.933 --> 00:25:21.653]  Just bring him the article.
[00:25:22.413 --> 00:25:22.674]  Thanks.
[00:25:25.014 --> 00:25:27.415]  They made a joke about, well, we hear about you have all this new transparency.
[00:25:27.435 --> 00:25:31.236]  And he goes, all the reporters together, because they're all arrogant.
[00:25:31.256 --> 00:25:33.556]  They're all going to get drunk together that night.
[00:25:33.576 --> 00:25:34.656]  They're all going to go party together.
[00:25:34.676 --> 00:25:36.657]  And it's just like Gibbs.
[00:25:39.616 --> 00:25:42.319]  Where he's just sitting there laughing the whole time.
[00:25:42.339 --> 00:25:45.222]  Remember the press secretary?
[00:25:45.242 --> 00:25:48.085]  Obama's first press secretary was in there three years.
[00:25:48.805 --> 00:25:57.354]  He said, listen, we were told to go on TV and say that there isn't a drone program and that's five years after it's operating and has killed thousands of people.
[00:25:58.595 --> 00:26:00.015]  And this is a program admitted to exist.
[00:26:00.716 --> 00:26:01.456]  But let's go back.
[00:26:02.176 --> 00:26:09.559]  This is the psychopathic, sociopathic criminals celebrating like when a psycho calls the cops and says, I just killed another little girl.
[00:26:09.739 --> 00:26:10.899]  There's nothing you can do.
[00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:12.540]  It's in their DNA.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.580]  Let's go back to the article.
[00:26:14.793 --> 00:26:15.153]  Video.
[00:26:16.033 --> 00:26:21.955]  State Department spokesman laughs at mention of transparency and democracy, and so does the press, keeping public informed.
[00:26:21.995 --> 00:26:24.355]  Literally a running joke to government elite.
[00:26:25.035 --> 00:26:26.676]  And they do this all the time.
[00:26:27.516 --> 00:26:31.757]  You think this little smart mouth weasel, yes man, would actually build something?
[00:26:32.957 --> 00:26:35.698]  You think that guy will take care of his kids at 2am when they got the flu?
[00:26:37.158 --> 00:26:40.459]  You think that guy would stand up for his wife if somebody did something to him in the parking lot?
[00:26:41.769 --> 00:26:44.289]  You think these type of people are who we need around, huh?
[00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:45.830]  And running things?
[00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:47.230]  Dishonorable cowards?
[00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:49.831]  Little smart-mouthed, frat boy bastards?
[00:26:51.291 --> 00:26:56.892]  I'm gonna play the clip coming up, this is in a special report I'm gonna air, that if you make this go viral, this is another coffin hell to the enemy.
[00:26:57.152 --> 00:27:02.033]  Just like I told you, you make that emergency message to Trump go viral, he'll put election fraud front and center.
[00:27:02.213 --> 00:27:03.813]  He did it less than 48 hours later.
[00:27:06.114 --> 00:27:07.394]  Obama slipped up.
[00:27:08.797 --> 00:27:14.238]  And basically reveal the secret election system that has been announcing elections since 1960s.
[00:27:15.739 --> 00:27:19.720]  And we're going to expose it coming up in the next segment, the special report I shot last night.
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.420]  It's up on Infowars.com, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:38.084]  But dealing with all this rigging, almost every time Trump talks about, we will not surrender to the Chinese government, and Hillary's an agent, they don't just cut the TV feeds on Fox, CNN, MSNBC.
[00:27:40.126 --> 00:27:52.394]  They kill internet feeds, and folks, when I saw the Young Turks and went up on the little side stage at Media Row, and they blew up and spit in my face and threatened to physically attack me when one of their people had directed me up, it was a setup.
[00:27:55.676 --> 00:27:59.038]  Within one hour, YouTube, that's who they work for, had pulled the videos.
[00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:07.243]  It was only because we had other sites to put them on to show what they'd done that they had to back off.
[00:28:10.595 --> 00:28:21.545]  I walk around this office up here in the afternoon at night when Trump's giving a speech, the audio will be on, and I'll hear him start talking as I'm getting a cup of coffee or water, and he'll go, and Crooked Hillary, she's an agent!
[00:28:21.585 --> 00:28:22.586]  And I go, it's gonna cut.
[00:28:24.508 --> 00:28:26.930]  See, we don't even see, this is how they overwhelm you with the technocracy.
[00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:33.355]  Because I'm just like so tired and just so used to it, I just go, hey, they just cut his feet again, but thank God other people are catching it.
[00:28:34.127 --> 00:28:38.789]  We're living in 1984 where I just expect, oh, they're going to cut that.
[00:28:38.809 --> 00:28:41.129]  I mean, I know when they're going to cut the feeds now.
[00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:46.291]  I have had them literally do it to me on YouTube.
[00:28:48.372 --> 00:28:51.813]  Because it was the YouTube stage that the young Turks were on.
[00:28:53.755 --> 00:28:54.235]  Video.
[00:28:54.375 --> 00:28:58.558]  ABC cuts live stream when Trump starts talking about Hillary's support for ISIS.
[00:28:58.578 --> 00:29:03.921]  But first, let's play the State Department head spokesman making a big, enjoyable joke.
[00:29:04.162 --> 00:29:05.322]  Because it's fun.
[00:29:05.422 --> 00:29:07.023]  Look, they don't want to just piss on us.
[00:29:08.945 --> 00:29:10.326]  They're going to rub it in, baby.
[00:29:10.386 --> 00:29:10.826]  Here it is.
[00:29:11.846 --> 00:29:12.747]  Welcome to the State Department.
[00:29:12.767 --> 00:29:14.208]  I think we have some interns in the back.
[00:29:14.268 --> 00:29:14.588]  Welcome.
[00:29:15.849 --> 00:29:22.033]  Good to see you in this exercise in transparency and democracy.
[00:29:25.692 --> 00:29:26.633]  Is that what it is?
[00:29:26.653 --> 00:29:30.977]  I thought it was an exercise in spin and obfuscation.
[00:29:39.181 --> 00:29:42.302]  Just going, oh yeah, and I learned how to triple and rip everybody off.
[00:29:42.342 --> 00:29:43.082]  The president liked me.
[00:29:43.242 --> 00:29:44.282]  He liked my lies best.
[00:29:44.502 --> 00:29:46.742]  And the other press was like, oh, oh, oh.
[00:29:46.922 --> 00:29:57.024]  And just all these arrogant sycophant reporters and the foppish spokesmen just... Like flying monkeys, man!
[00:29:57.944 --> 00:29:58.725]  And they got their witch!
[00:29:59.825 --> 00:30:00.745]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.225 --> 00:30:02.825]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.745 --> 00:30:06.446]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:15.413 --> 00:30:22.857]  On July 30th, Alex Jones made a request that Donald Trump make rigged elections one of the central campaign issues.
[00:30:23.597 --> 00:30:28.940]  On August 1st, Donald Trump went on Sean Hannity and spoke with Sean about rigged elections.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:36.204]  Vladimir Putin came out a few days later and spoke about how American elections have been rigged in the past.
[00:30:36.804 --> 00:30:38.405]  Here's a recap of those events.
[00:30:39.025 --> 00:30:42.087]  Mr. Trump, I'm not going to lay things out here that you don't already know.
[00:30:43.007 --> 00:30:55.932]  But I am going to ask you to seriously think about making the issue of Hillary's election fraud in the primaries one of the central issues to defeating her in November.
[00:30:56.272 --> 00:31:00.293]  And I'm telling you, November 8th, we better be careful because that election's gonna be rigged.
[00:31:00.433 --> 00:31:01.214]  First of all, it's rigged.
[00:31:01.774 --> 00:31:04.295]  And I'm afraid the election's gonna be rigged, I have to be honest.
[00:31:04.975 --> 00:31:08.737]  And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's going to be taken away from us.
[00:31:08.917 --> 00:31:12.359]  America teaches everybody how to live in, quote, democracy.
[00:31:12.899 --> 00:31:13.360]  But what?
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:16.701]  You actually believe that they have democratic elections there?
[00:31:17.082 --> 00:31:25.286]  If Hillary steals the nomination and then she openly is engaged in chicanery and things don't add up with Trump, you have to say it must be thrown out.
[00:31:25.806 --> 00:31:34.491]  Hillary Clinton has had every advantage, every break given to her from the very beginning by this Democratic Party.
[00:31:34.591 --> 00:31:35.531]  It has been rigged.
[00:31:35.571 --> 00:31:40.874]  The political parties choose their nominee, not the general public, contrary to popular belief.
[00:31:41.194 --> 00:31:42.735]  Then why are they holding the primaries?
[00:31:43.726 --> 00:31:44.946]  That's a very good question.
[00:31:45.086 --> 00:31:59.310]  It is clearly the case that when given truth serum, Debbie Wasserman Schultz vastly prefers Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, obviously, and to the extent there are things that can be done institutionally and marginally to facilitate that outcome, they are being done.
[00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:04.392]  When did the press see it as their role to protect the prerogative of the powerful?
[00:32:04.472 --> 00:32:05.432]  Actually, I think that's part of it.
[00:32:05.692 --> 00:32:09.417]  And we're not going to recognize Queen Hillary if there's evidence of fraud.
[00:32:09.717 --> 00:32:10.598]  And guess what there is?
[00:32:10.858 --> 00:32:12.741]  She stole the nomination!
[00:32:12.981 --> 00:32:15.164]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[00:32:15.244 --> 00:32:15.965]  What does that mean?
[00:32:16.724 --> 00:32:18.566]  How would the party pick a new nominee?
[00:32:18.786 --> 00:32:19.707]  Today is the day!
[00:32:19.767 --> 00:32:23.310]  They're really thinking about maybe getting him off the top of the ticket.
[00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:26.232]  He now looks increasingly like the Kamikaze kid.
[00:32:26.813 --> 00:32:29.735]  An implosion the likes of which I have never seen.
[00:32:29.755 --> 00:32:32.878]  The biggest problem we have is we have a very dishonest media.
[00:32:33.559 --> 00:32:44.248]  If Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country,
[00:32:46.013 --> 00:32:48.335]  Including in places like Texas.
[00:32:50.597 --> 00:32:51.197]  That's ridiculous.
[00:32:51.317 --> 00:32:52.318]  That doesn't make any sense.
[00:32:52.398 --> 00:32:54.280]  And I don't think anybody would take that seriously.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.323]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars is now controlling the narrative.
[00:32:58.783 --> 00:33:04.328]  Go to InfoWars.com for more information and InfoWarsStore.com to support the fight for truth.
[00:33:26.331 --> 00:33:32.174]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:32.414 --> 00:33:35.195]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:35.756 --> 00:33:37.517]  So, here's the big secret that isn't a secret.
[00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:46.561]  You have the global corporations, the Fortune 100, six big banks that finance them with unlimited money they just print out of nothing.
[00:33:48.042 --> 00:33:50.183]  They are eugenicists, that is their world program.
[00:33:51.653 --> 00:33:56.658]  Post-industrial, anti-human, exterminist, ultra-Hitlerian operation.
[00:33:57.999 --> 00:33:59.301]  Proto-ultra-Hitlerian.
[00:34:00.822 --> 00:34:01.783]  Not Neo-Hitlerian.
[00:34:02.284 --> 00:34:03.445]  This is what created Hitler.
[00:34:04.286 --> 00:34:05.307]  He was just a test.
[00:34:06.488 --> 00:34:08.290]  And to put the bad cop in a larger paradigm.
[00:34:12.148 --> 00:34:19.674]  They have gotten the political establishment and the media establishment to become pure, wanton henchmen of totalitarianism.
[00:34:20.654 --> 00:34:29.821]  And they are now moving forward, rolling forward with massive censorship, control, persecution, economic warfare, and every form of criminal activity you can imagine.
[00:34:33.844 --> 00:34:37.727]  It is imperative to completely pull out of Amazon and all these major systems at this point.
[00:34:40.891 --> 00:34:53.276]  I'd always believed being part of them would give us influence and that because they created these monopolies we could get involved in those to basically sap funding out of the globalists, which we've done successfully.
[00:34:54.477 --> 00:34:56.758]  But now it's reaching economic warfare level.
[00:34:58.179 --> 00:35:00.300]  And they're not hurting us.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.300]  They're not stopping us.
[00:35:02.681 --> 00:35:05.762]  But they are hurting a lot of other people that didn't think ahead to stop it.
[00:35:09.909 --> 00:35:12.930]  And this is only a shade of things to come.
[00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:17.851]  But it's already ultra-intense, ultra-illegal, and they're just doing it.
[00:35:19.572 --> 00:35:23.753]  Just like it came out, Nielsen was giving CNN and MSNBC fake ratings for a decade.
[00:35:24.033 --> 00:35:24.813]  No one got in trouble.
[00:35:25.113 --> 00:35:26.574]  They were just ripping off advertisers.
[00:35:27.254 --> 00:35:27.894]  Fake ratings?
[00:35:27.914 --> 00:35:30.214]  You got 100,000 viewers?
[00:35:30.234 --> 00:35:30.214]  200,000?
[00:35:30.895 --> 00:35:31.975]  People are a joke.
[00:35:32.275 --> 00:35:32.795]  And they know it.
[00:35:32.895 --> 00:35:35.876]  They know they're a joke, they know they're criminal, so now they're going for broke.
[00:35:35.916 --> 00:35:39.197]  And all they've got is their snickering hatred and their snickering ignorance.
[00:35:40.916 --> 00:35:43.357]  And the New York Times comes out and says it's time to lie to everybody.
[00:35:45.778 --> 00:35:50.301]  They're now moralizing that lying is good and wanting to kill Trump is good.
[00:35:50.321 --> 00:35:51.381]  I mean, I've got the articles here.
[00:35:52.742 --> 00:35:58.004]  Before I go any further and show you the censored info with Trump, it's the last chance for free shipping.
[00:35:58.024 --> 00:35:58.905]  We're going to end it today.
[00:35:59.005 --> 00:35:59.885]  I'm extending it one day.
[00:36:00.486 --> 00:36:02.987]  It's over today on everythingandinfowrestore.com.
[00:36:03.607 --> 00:36:08.169]  The non-GMO seeds, the books, the videos, the Hillary for prison shirts, everything's free shipping.
[00:36:08.209 --> 00:36:09.270]  The Bill Clinton rape shirts.
[00:36:11.104 --> 00:36:12.345]  The colloidal silver, you name it.
[00:36:12.365 --> 00:36:17.707]  The only thing that doesn't have free shipping is the colloidal silver, because that is 50% off for starting that sale.
[00:36:17.987 --> 00:36:21.148]  I wasn't starting it until Wednesday, but hell, it's up there, so that sells live, too.
[00:36:21.668 --> 00:36:22.729]  So there you go, Silver Bullet.
[00:36:23.509 --> 00:36:25.090]  Really good price at $19.95 for $9.95.
[00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:26.590]  You're not going to beat it.
[00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:32.152]  It's the same private label stuff they sell at Whole Foods for $20, $25.
[00:36:32.212 --> 00:36:33.453]  $9.95, great to stock up on that.
[00:36:34.433 --> 00:36:35.714]  Has a really long shelf life.
[00:36:36.883 --> 00:36:41.707]  InfowarsStore.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:42.508 --> 00:36:43.749]  And here's what I'm getting at.
[00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:48.212]  BrainForce will sell out today, so I've got to hold back some for folks that are on auto-ship.
[00:36:48.533 --> 00:36:50.254]  So you want BrainForce at 40% off?
[00:36:50.274 --> 00:36:51.395]  You need to do that right now as well.
[00:36:51.415 --> 00:36:52.176]  We're about to pull that.
[00:36:53.937 --> 00:36:55.298]  But I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:36:55.338 --> 00:36:58.641]  But listen, these are great items at very low prices that are game-changers.
[00:36:59.122 --> 00:37:00.823]  They don't want you to have good iodine in your body.
[00:37:01.183 --> 00:37:03.005]  Go research the iodine conspiracy.
[00:37:05.418 --> 00:37:17.921]  But what I'm getting at here is, it's so obvious we're the tip of the spear, it's so obvious that free independent media is under attack everywhere, and we're kicking their butt because you've been supporting us at the grassroots and circumventing their technocracy.
[00:37:19.261 --> 00:37:20.782]  We built our ragtag system.
[00:37:24.063 --> 00:37:33.605]  I am here, pouring everything I can into this, with the wonderful crew we've got, and I'm watching either people awaken around the world and around the country,
[00:37:37.759 --> 00:37:41.002]  But I'm also watching other people basically turn into zombies.
[00:37:44.526 --> 00:37:49.632]  Now, before I go any further, it just comes down to this.
[00:37:52.775 --> 00:37:53.916]  Excuse me, you guys said something there?
[00:37:55.478 --> 00:37:56.839]  All right, just print it whenever you get a chance.
[00:37:57.039 --> 00:37:57.220]  Thanks.
[00:38:03.143 --> 00:38:06.204]  All the stability we've seen so far is going to be disappearing.
[00:38:06.705 --> 00:38:17.749]  World government's here and it's here to wreck the planet and bring in hell on earth and consolidate control while the globalists are in their armored safe zones.
[00:38:23.132 --> 00:38:30.275]  And it is so important for everyone to understand that this is not a game.
[00:38:32.722 --> 00:38:33.603]  This is not a joke.
[00:38:34.904 --> 00:38:35.885]  This is not a drill.
[00:38:35.905 --> 00:38:41.351]  This is not my opinion.
[00:38:41.371 --> 00:38:49.899]  This is the reality of what we face as a civilization.
[00:38:51.641 --> 00:38:52.962]  And we have a bunch of bullying.
[00:38:54.263 --> 00:38:55.585]  We have a bunch of intimidation.
[00:38:57.409 --> 00:39:03.055]  Going on against humanity right now, and I'm telling you, I've studied other tyrannies.
[00:39:04.556 --> 00:39:04.896]  Thank you.
[00:39:05.177 --> 00:39:19.871]  I have studied their mindsets, what makes them tick, and this tyranny we're facing is the most horrible, wicked, evil group the earth has ever faced.
[00:39:21.621 --> 00:39:24.783]  They want to vandalize the entire Earth.
[00:39:25.584 --> 00:39:29.847]  They want to mutate and destroy life itself.
[00:39:30.527 --> 00:39:32.909]  They are a wrecking crew from hell.
[00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:36.992]  And anyone with discernment, anyone that has any spirit left in them knows that.
[00:39:37.692 --> 00:39:40.794]  A lot of people I know are falling to TV and video games and Fantasyland.
[00:39:40.854 --> 00:39:41.655]  It's designed to do that.
[00:39:42.195 --> 00:39:43.456]  They're in trance states.
[00:39:43.596 --> 00:39:45.498]  You're not going to be able to probably reach those people.
[00:39:46.158 --> 00:39:50.121]  You need to reach people who aren't in the trance state, who aren't under the Great Delusion first.
[00:39:53.177 --> 00:39:57.480]  And hopefully get them to become aware of it so that they don't fall under its spell.
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:04.224]  And believe me, if you're not under its spell, you are only going to intensify your understanding and your awakening.
[00:40:04.484 --> 00:40:08.187]  There's a reason they're trying to put people into this artificial sleep state.
[00:40:10.984 --> 00:40:19.850]  And this isn't from some short story written in the 1950s, which was turned into a movie, They Live, where our signal's not strong enough, we're cutting through to you.
[00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:24.192]  They're putting you in a near-sleep trance with the signal.
[00:40:24.873 --> 00:40:26.654]  Our signal's not strong enough to block it.
[00:40:28.055 --> 00:40:29.556]  You see that, and it's an allegory in a movie.
[00:40:29.616 --> 00:40:30.376]  It's not an allegory.
[00:40:31.757 --> 00:40:38.802]  By the 50s, they had flicker rates and systems that could put someone who's suggestible into a trance state.
[00:40:41.015 --> 00:40:43.176]  You walk by the kids watching TV, they're drooling.
[00:40:43.476 --> 00:40:45.677]  They're in a trance state medically.
[00:40:45.757 --> 00:40:48.179]  More and more people are in a trance state.
[00:40:49.259 --> 00:41:06.148]  And they're all got their virtual reality goggles on, shitting there, mutating down into a blob, while Zuckerberg walks the bipedal predator past his minions that he has literally brought into his own universe.
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:16.304]  And they're taking us there so that we will accept the horrors of what's going to happen here in this third dimension.
[00:41:17.785 --> 00:41:24.351]  This is a evil plan, and boy, let me tell you folks, we need to be fighting it with every scrap of our bodies.
[00:41:24.531 --> 00:41:30.115]  If you're not sending our articles out, or if you're not taking my analysis, here's really what I don't have.
[00:41:30.215 --> 00:41:30.996]  I don't have the funds.
[00:41:32.417 --> 00:41:33.158]  I don't have the crew.
[00:41:33.258 --> 00:41:33.978]  I don't have the wherewithal.
[00:41:35.031 --> 00:41:42.558]  To actually take what I say on air and put it in daily articles and then link to the points I'm making and kind of data briefings to the world.
[00:41:42.918 --> 00:41:49.765]  That's what Paul Watson, 17 years ago, he would do on his own website and I noticed he would give us credit.
[00:41:49.805 --> 00:41:53.428]  It was basically transcripts of what I had to say and then he would go and actually find the links.
[00:41:53.969 --> 00:41:55.290]  And I said, hey, why don't you just work with me?
[00:41:58.953 --> 00:42:00.695]  You're just as important as we are, folks.
[00:42:02.654 --> 00:42:09.760]  And to yuppies and trendies and other people that hear this show for the first time and think it's a joke, listen, this isn't a joke, okay?
[00:42:11.681 --> 00:42:29.015]  If you think Amazon's gonna stop blocking patriot, libertarian, conservative, and Christian websites and stores, and delisting them, and saying they don't have traffic, with fraudulent information, to bankrupt an entire class and group of people, don't you understand they're coming for you next?
[00:42:33.925 --> 00:42:40.427]  One of the biggest blind spots in this country and in this world is that people think of themselves very selfishly, like it's a shield.
[00:42:40.507 --> 00:42:51.151]  And they go, well, I don't care if they put a big tax on, you know, say the local highway, I don't have a car.
[00:42:52.611 --> 00:42:55.232]  All those expenses are going to be passed on to you, stupid.
[00:43:01.547 --> 00:43:02.508]  People don't understand.
[00:43:02.528 --> 00:43:03.689]  Well, I don't own coal stocks.
[00:43:03.729 --> 00:43:05.591]  Why do I care if they've doubled prices?
[00:43:06.171 --> 00:43:08.233]  Because that doubles the general price of electricity.
[00:43:08.494 --> 00:43:09.655]  And then the society crumbles.
[00:43:09.835 --> 00:43:14.199]  And then when other countries are able to have cheaper electricity by global design, we shut down.
[00:43:14.219 --> 00:43:21.125]  I want to play these two clips because this is the censored one from ABC News.
[00:43:22.125 --> 00:43:23.426]  The story's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:43:23.606 --> 00:43:25.808]  And then we have the clip of what they actually censored.
[00:43:26.149 --> 00:43:30.032]  ABC cuts live stream when Trump starts talking about Hillary's support for ISIS.
[00:43:30.293 --> 00:43:31.734]  You know, he says she's the founder of ISIS.
[00:43:31.914 --> 00:43:32.715]  Here's where they censor.
[00:43:33.988 --> 00:43:35.209]  Take a look at Orlando.
[00:43:35.509 --> 00:43:36.970]  Take a look at San Bernardino.
[00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:38.871]  Take a look at the World Trade Center.
[00:43:39.252 --> 00:43:41.453]  Take a look at what's going on.
[00:43:41.753 --> 00:43:42.894]  And then worldwide.
[00:43:43.474 --> 00:43:46.917]  And we let ISIS take this position.
[00:43:47.537 --> 00:43:53.962]  It was Hillary Clinton that she should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS.
[00:43:56.844 --> 00:43:58.545]  Oh, ABC's cut out right there.
[00:43:59.861 --> 00:44:05.265]  Now, let's go ahead and show what he actually said before they started censoring, and here it is.
[00:44:06.346 --> 00:44:07.547]  Take a look at Orlando.
[00:44:07.847 --> 00:44:09.328]  Take a look at San Bernardino.
[00:44:09.548 --> 00:44:11.370]  Take a look at the World Trade Center.
[00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:13.792]  Take a look at what's going on.
[00:44:14.112 --> 00:44:15.233]  And then worldwide.
[00:44:15.833 --> 00:44:19.256]  And we let ISIS take this position.
[00:44:19.896 --> 00:44:25.761]  It was Hillary Clinton that she should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS.
[00:44:25.961 --> 00:44:26.662]  That's what it was.
[00:44:28.563 --> 00:44:29.284]  That's what it was.
[00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:31.070]  Her weakness.
[00:44:32.031 --> 00:44:33.352]  Her weak policy.
[00:44:33.412 --> 00:44:33.792]  That's good.
[00:44:34.652 --> 00:44:41.736]  Now, I want to go ahead and go to this special report that's on Infowars.com that needs to go absolutely total viral.
[00:44:42.257 --> 00:44:49.621]  It's titled, Obama Slips Up, Reveals Secret Group, Controlling Elections.
[00:44:49.721 --> 00:44:51.061]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:44:51.382 --> 00:44:52.482]  I'm going to have it red-linked.
[00:44:52.502 --> 00:44:54.623]  I'm going to put it back to the top of Infowars.com.
[00:44:54.884 --> 00:44:56.084]  Facebook, Twitter, you name it.
[00:44:56.444 --> 00:44:57.885]  This needs to have maximum push.
[00:44:57.905 --> 00:44:58.906]  Then I've got another report.
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:05.442]  Donald Trump, if you look at actual social media numbers, is going to totally dominate Hillary with a landslide unless she steals it.
[00:45:05.742 --> 00:45:06.902]  Here is a key report.
[00:45:08.742 --> 00:45:10.943]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[00:45:11.003 --> 00:45:11.783]  What does that mean?
[00:45:13.824 --> 00:45:24.487]  If Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country,
[00:45:26.283 --> 00:45:37.473]  Including in places like Texas, where typically it's not Democrats who are in charge of voting booths.
[00:45:39.075 --> 00:45:39.716]  That's ridiculous.
[00:45:39.796 --> 00:45:40.797]  That doesn't make any sense.
[00:45:40.897 --> 00:45:42.718]  And I don't think anybody would take that seriously.
[00:45:43.559 --> 00:45:54.083]  That was President Obama at a Pentagon press briefing last Thursday before he went to Martha's Vineyard to play his 300th round of golf there since he's been president.
[00:45:55.024 --> 00:45:59.686]  And he thinks you're off playing golf mentally because anyone who has
[00:46:00.706 --> 00:46:11.811]  Any basic memory, anyone that pays attention to what's happened, not just here in the United States, but all over the world, knows that election fraud from the highest levels is commonplace.
[00:46:12.392 --> 00:46:16.274]  And that there are hundreds of documented instances in this country's history.
[00:46:16.974 --> 00:46:18.995]  Now that's just establishment election fraud.
[00:46:19.635 --> 00:46:23.617]  Voter fraud goes on by the millions every two years.
[00:46:24.277 --> 00:46:25.258]  That's been confirmed.
[00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:29.792]  So Obama gets up there and says, election fraud, what's that?
[00:46:29.832 --> 00:46:35.535]  It's like when Hillary was before the Senate committee and they said, what about the Turkish ambassador in Benghazi?
[00:46:35.555 --> 00:46:40.838]  She goes, turkeys, turkeys, thinking the public wouldn't know about the country of Turkey.
[00:46:41.418 --> 00:46:46.121]  Instead would have thought of a ground foraging bird that we eat on Thanksgiving.
[00:46:47.362 --> 00:46:52.805]  Now here at InfoWars, we're going to be chronicling every single day in the next 90 days till the election.
[00:46:54.127 --> 00:46:55.068]  What's really happening?
[00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:58.211]  And we're going to break down the facts of what's unfolding.
[00:46:59.972 --> 00:47:12.724]  But before I get into who actually counts the votes here, because Obama slipped up when he said, oh, if Trump's 15 points ahead in polls, but then doesn't win, then I'll be suspicious.
[00:47:13.885 --> 00:47:17.628]  He knows good and damn well that the polls themselves are fixed.
[00:47:17.928 --> 00:47:18.969]  And I'm going to get to that in a moment.
[00:47:21.089 --> 00:47:21.549]  I want to look
[00:47:43.052 --> 00:47:51.154]  Propagated across the country, including in places like Texas, where typically it is not Democrats who are in charge of voting booths.
[00:47:51.614 --> 00:47:52.534]  That's ridiculous.
[00:47:52.594 --> 00:47:53.695]  That doesn't make sense.
[00:47:54.315 --> 00:47:56.015]  We're talking about a national election.
[00:47:56.255 --> 00:48:04.777]  We're talking about theft of battleground states like Ohio and Florida that are continually being stolen by both sides.
[00:48:05.738 --> 00:48:07.078]  We're not talking about places like
[00:48:09.329 --> 00:48:11.910]  Oregon, or places like Texas.
[00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:15.792]  Oregon going for Democrats, Texas going for Republicans, historically.
[00:48:16.092 --> 00:48:17.593]  But see, he builds a straw man.
[00:48:18.293 --> 00:48:20.934]  Oh, we hear this conspiracy theory out of Texas.
[00:48:21.254 --> 00:48:24.656]  That's how they always refer to us, the Texan, or the Texas conspiracy theory.
[00:48:25.256 --> 00:48:26.857]  Oh, you know, we know Trump's listening to that guy.
[00:48:27.637 --> 00:48:30.519]  So, what, you think we're going to steal Texas?
[00:48:30.579 --> 00:48:32.239]  Why, Republicans run Texas.
[00:48:32.559 --> 00:48:33.660]  How preposterous.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.401]  So he builds a straw man.
[00:48:36.261 --> 00:48:46.383]  Then he goes on, and this is the key, to say, if Mr. Trump is up 10 or 15 points on election day and he ends up losing, then you know maybe he can raise some questions, Obama said.
[00:48:46.804 --> 00:48:48.784]  That doesn't seem to be the case at the moment.
[00:48:49.684 --> 00:48:51.365]  Obama has really stepped in it.
[00:48:52.305 --> 00:48:58.526]  Thanks to Trump coming out and exposing the fact that they tried to rig the primaries against him and did steal the primary from Bernie Sanders.
[00:48:59.587 --> 00:49:02.927]  Obama has been forced to come out and respond to this.
[00:49:03.107 --> 00:49:04.368]  And in doing so, he screwed up.
[00:49:04.988 --> 00:49:05.548]  Did you catch it?
[00:49:06.775 --> 00:49:10.098]  He said, oh, don't worry, Hillary's ahead in the polls.
[00:49:11.159 --> 00:49:14.843]  And look, we're going to go off those polls come election day.
[00:49:16.164 --> 00:49:17.746]  What he didn't tell you was twofold.
[00:49:18.226 --> 00:49:25.514]  He didn't tell you that Reuters and AP are part of the super secret private consortium that announces who the winner is nationwide.
[00:49:26.766 --> 00:49:29.027]  It's been a controversy every election for decades.
[00:49:29.207 --> 00:49:30.048]  We're going to get to that in a moment.
[00:49:30.948 --> 00:49:39.874]  And he didn't tell you that they've changed the methodology since Trump got way ahead in the polls to sample 10 to 15% more.
[00:49:43.257 --> 00:49:45.979]  Democrats in a poll than Republicans.
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:54.186]  Putting Hillary 10 to 15 points ahead fraudulently in what a lot of top pollsters have called criminal fraud.
[00:49:54.767 --> 00:49:56.508]  Absolute malfeasance.
[00:49:56.829 --> 00:49:58.330]  So let's look at some of those poll numbers.
[00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:01.833]  Here's an example from Reuters' own website.
[00:50:03.131 --> 00:50:09.758]  Where they conducted polls July 16th to July 20th with the new methodology they are still continuing with.
[00:50:09.818 --> 00:50:12.981]  650 Democrats versus 496 Republicans.
[00:50:13.482 --> 00:50:20.048]  Then they've been caught also skewing so-called independents, 196, mainly picking, quote, Democrats and progressives.
[00:50:20.729 --> 00:50:28.854]  Then they're able to give you the number of Hillary Clinton 7 to 10 points ahead, and they're continuing to use this methodology, something they've never done before.
[00:50:29.334 --> 00:50:43.522]  But despite that, if you fast forward to now, in early August, Zero Hedge breaks down and links directly to Reuters, where suddenly her 10 point lead has shrunk to 3 points or has evaporated in some of their other polls.
[00:50:43.962 --> 00:50:49.165]  Despite the fraudulent methodology of adding 10 to 15 percentage points to Hillary,
[00:50:49.605 --> 00:50:55.309]  By sampling, knowing Democrats are going to go for her, she still has 0 to 3% lead.
[00:50:55.549 --> 00:50:57.730]  That gives Trump a 10 to 12% lead.
[00:50:58.451 --> 00:51:02.714]  And don't forget, there's a lot of closeted voters out there that are just populists who want change.
[00:51:02.914 --> 00:51:08.657]  A lot of Sanders voters know they were robbed, who are scared to say they're voting for Trump, but are planning to vote for Trump.
[00:51:09.738 --> 00:51:13.120]  Now let's look at the most important information yet.
[00:51:13.841 --> 00:51:15.102]  Breitbart is reporting
[00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:20.613]  On numbers that anybody can compile for themselves that Gateway Pundit put together.
[00:51:20.713 --> 00:51:21.734]  These are public numbers.
[00:51:22.174 --> 00:51:23.215]  These are crowdsourcing.
[00:51:23.635 --> 00:51:33.182]  And whether it's Facebook, whether it's Twitter, you name it, Trump has three, four, five times the positive reviews and the support that Hillary does.
[00:51:33.943 --> 00:51:35.984]  And that's what we see on the streets of America.
[00:51:36.645 --> 00:51:38.686]  We can't find Hillary signs or Hillary stickers.
[00:51:39.086 --> 00:51:45.271]  We did exit polls ourselves in California, and eight out of ten people were supporting Sanders over Hillary.
[00:51:46.175 --> 00:51:49.906]  But see, don't forget, AP, and we're getting to that right now.
[00:51:51.155 --> 00:51:54.997]  Met the day before with the superdelegates at a rich donor's house with Hillary.
[00:51:55.797 --> 00:51:58.398]  And the superdelegates said, we're going for Hillary regardless.
[00:51:58.758 --> 00:52:01.980]  So that's when AP admits they, quote, called it for Hillary.
[00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:10.183]  And then AP itself, part of the secretive organization, then the next day announced the winners at about 8 o'clock at night.
[00:52:10.784 --> 00:52:13.385]  And they did it arrogantly, right out in plain view.
[00:52:13.485 --> 00:52:13.785]  Why?
[00:52:14.545 --> 00:52:20.248]  Because the bigger the fraud, the more you have to act like what you're doing is completely normal.
[00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:25.030]  Now it's very important to note, I have interviewed the late, great Collier brothers.
[00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:29.291]  I have interviewed Bev Harris, who made the documentary, Hacking Democracy for HBO.
[00:52:29.651 --> 00:52:41.214]  I have interviewed hundreds of experts, mathematicians, statisticians, die-bold chief engineers that have testified to legislatures in Congress that they were ordered to engage in fraud.
[00:52:41.374 --> 00:52:42.155]  This is bipartisan.
[00:52:43.315 --> 00:52:46.796]  So when Obama denies all this is going on, this is admitted fact.
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:50.101]  You know about white box voting fraud.
[00:52:50.141 --> 00:52:51.342]  Everybody's seen it in the news.
[00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:55.244]  Again, it's like he's denying something that everybody knows exists.
[00:52:55.664 --> 00:52:58.306]  But what the public's not aware of is how they do it.
[00:52:59.451 --> 00:53:02.073]  Now they can steal the election at the local area with hacking.
[00:53:02.514 --> 00:53:04.535]  They can stuff the ballot boxes and that certainly goes on.
[00:53:04.815 --> 00:53:22.970]  But the way it's really done is in close battleground states, you simply have the news announced hours before the polls close that someone else is projected to win and that other people don't go and cast their ballots or everyone just kind of gives up and believes that person is really the winner.
[00:53:24.972 --> 00:53:27.934]  But no one ever asked who actually tallies the votes.
[00:53:28.974 --> 00:53:30.036]  At the national level.
[00:53:30.817 --> 00:53:43.773]  Shortly after JFK's death in 1963, the Associated Press officially, but very quietly, took over the tabulation nationally of who the supposed winners of the elections were.
[00:53:44.838 --> 00:53:46.399]  Election after election.
[00:53:46.799 --> 00:53:53.181]  Voter News Service's numbers didn't match up with the real exit polls and recounts.
[00:53:53.481 --> 00:54:01.904]  They got caught in so many national computer glitches that they were forced to disband the organization after the 2002 election.
[00:54:02.344 --> 00:54:09.206]  But one day later, a new corporation was formed with the exact same six companies at the head.
[00:54:09.747 --> 00:54:13.108]  And that, of course, was National Election Pool.
[00:54:14.028 --> 00:54:26.944]  National election pool is made up again of the very same mainstream media that runs the fraudulent polls and then ensures that those fraudulent poll numbers are regurgitated on election night.
[00:54:27.445 --> 00:54:28.466]  And they're so arrogant.
[00:54:29.147 --> 00:54:30.829]  They're so brazen now.
[00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:41.283]  That they actually met before multiple primaries, like the California primary, and decided that Bernie Sanders would not get the popular vote.
[00:54:41.884 --> 00:54:47.832]  Even though the popular vote did go to him in New Hampshire, California, and nine other states.
[00:54:48.713 --> 00:54:54.959]  What you've seen here is a snapshot of the ocean of proof of election fraud.
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:58.563]  Many people have died trying to bring this information out.
[00:54:58.963 --> 00:55:01.285]  The Collier brothers went through living hell.
[00:55:01.666 --> 00:55:03.567]  Their daughter fights on valiantly today.
[00:55:03.988 --> 00:55:04.829]  So does Beth Harris.
[00:55:05.629 --> 00:55:13.236]  I want to challenge all of you to go out and do your own basic research on this and then ask yourself, what on earth
[00:55:14.164 --> 00:55:17.305]  What is Obama doing when he makes a joke out of this?
[00:55:18.225 --> 00:55:25.647]  He's doing the same thing that the spokesperson for the State Department did last Thursday, when they brought up how they're supposed to be transparent and open.
[00:55:26.307 --> 00:55:29.648]  He made a big joke, and so did the media, and they laughed at the American people.
[00:55:30.128 --> 00:55:31.088]  Welcome to the State Department.
[00:55:31.108 --> 00:55:32.509]  I think we have some interns in the back.
[00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.869]  Welcome.
[00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:40.311]  Good to see you in this exercise in transparency and democracy.
[00:55:44.129 --> 00:55:47.031]  That's just like Gibbs, the former press secretary.
[00:55:47.311 --> 00:55:52.814]  For years, after the drone program was public, he was told to go on TV and say it didn't exist.
[00:55:53.094 --> 00:56:05.300]  The New York Times reports that Vice President Biden, in these sessions talking about the way forward, has pressed specifically for a strategy that elevates the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, drones, and de-emphasizes U.S.
[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:06.501]  combat forces on the ground.
[00:56:06.721 --> 00:56:08.043]  Can you tell us if that's true?
[00:56:08.424 --> 00:56:09.967]  I think you can understand why.
[00:56:09.987 --> 00:56:13.893]  I'm not going to get into internal discussions.
[00:56:15.546 --> 00:56:16.627]  Yeah, look, that's true.
[00:56:16.667 --> 00:56:18.448]  I'm not going to get into it.
[00:56:45.726 --> 00:56:50.171]  And the good news is the American people and the people of the world aren't buying the fraud anymore.
[00:56:50.571 --> 00:56:55.296]  It was just eight days ago that I put out an emergency message to Donald Trump concerning the evidence of election fraud.
[00:56:55.957 --> 00:56:56.437]  And you know what?
[00:56:56.497 --> 00:57:02.383]  Trump responded within 48 hours and it became a national issue, a national debate, and Obama was forced to respond.
[00:57:03.633 --> 00:57:10.378]  Now, if Trump and others point out that we have this national election pool running the show, they may be forced to back off.
[00:57:11.119 --> 00:57:14.561]  You see, Trump isn't a puppet like a Mitt Romney or a John McCain.
[00:57:15.122 --> 00:57:18.444]  He's not going to sit there and let them steal this from the American people.
[00:57:19.385 --> 00:57:29.553]  And now it's up to the American people to do our job and help Mr. Trump and help Bernie Sanders supporters as well ensure that free and open elections continue on in this country.
[00:57:30.033 --> 00:57:32.455]  They may have stolen it from Sanders at the nomination level.
[00:57:33.285 --> 00:57:37.948]  But they're not going to steal this national election without an information warfare fight.
[00:57:44.713 --> 00:57:49.817]  Now that extremely important report is on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:57:51.058 --> 00:57:56.402]  And I don't want the credit from Breitbart or WorldNetDaily or Daily Caller or any of these places.
[00:57:56.782 --> 00:58:02.647]  I know you're better organizations that might actually research this yourselves and put reports on it, zero heads, you name it.
[00:58:03.769 --> 00:58:09.376]  I'm asking for your children, my children, for the future safety of this world.
[00:58:10.117 --> 00:58:13.982]  Let everybody go, burrow into our research, find out it's accurate, and get it out to everybody you know.
[00:58:14.803 --> 00:58:16.725]  The video is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:58:16.785 --> 00:58:17.586]  It's a special report.
[00:58:17.646 --> 00:58:18.467]  Obama slips up.
[00:58:18.827 --> 00:58:20.730]  Secret group running elections revealed.
[00:58:22.281 --> 00:58:24.261]  You need to get this video out to everybody you know.
[00:58:24.281 --> 00:58:30.582]  There's another video I'm going to play dealing with social media and how far Trump really is ahead there as well.
[00:58:31.063 --> 00:58:40.624]  The reason they're panicking in the New York Times and places and saying let's just not even tolerate opposition now, I didn't even get to that key point, is because they know Trump's 15 points ahead.
[00:58:41.825 --> 00:58:47.566]  And I haven't even gotten yet to the New York Times not just calling, you know, admitting my censor, but saying shut down opposition.
[00:58:47.806 --> 00:58:49.726]  They're going full totalitarian.
[00:58:51.121 --> 00:58:52.921]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:53.842 --> 00:58:56.522]  In the face of that, we have to get aggressive.
[00:59:00.623 --> 00:59:09.685]  If you can't see the irony in having a gun ban enforced by men with guns, well then you fail to understand why the Second Amendment was written in the first place.
[00:59:09.725 --> 00:59:12.586]  Throughout history, only slaves are disarmed.
[00:59:12.706 --> 00:59:16.447]  A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
[00:59:16.587 --> 00:59:17.688]  The right of the people.
[00:59:17.788 --> 00:59:18.928]  The right of the people.
[00:59:19.008 --> 00:59:19.909]  The right of the people.
[00:59:19.989 --> 00:59:22.450]  To keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:31.374]  For all of you actors out there who go to your red carpet events surrounded by full battle rattle SWAT teams while you accept your awards for your latest violent movie.
[00:59:31.714 --> 00:59:40.599]  For all you politicians who spend your nine to five days scheming up ways to take away my second amendment rights meanwhile you have first responders on site there to protect you.
[00:59:40.959 --> 00:59:43.001]  I say this, come and take it.
[00:59:43.181 --> 00:59:45.683]  I have a strict gun control policy.
[00:59:46.143 --> 00:59:48.745]  If there's a gun around, I want to control it.
[00:59:49.386 --> 00:59:50.066]  Clint Eastwood.
[00:59:50.286 --> 00:59:52.768]  Go ahead, make my day.
[00:59:52.928 --> 00:59:58.292]  Dads demand guns because it's me that's got to get up and go check out that noise at 2am.
[00:59:58.533 --> 01:00:05.118]  Infowars.com You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:06.616 --> 01:00:17.146]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[01:00:17.506 --> 01:00:22.891]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[01:00:23.431 --> 01:00:28.656]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[01:00:29.497 --> 01:00:30.798]  It is a big idea.
[01:00:30.858 --> 01:00:32.339]  A new world order.
[01:00:36.690 --> 01:00:39.496]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[01:00:39.696 --> 01:00:41.239]  It just pancaked.
[01:00:43.604 --> 01:00:47.431]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[01:01:00.606 --> 01:01:06.208]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:11.340]  Guns will be taken.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.421]  No one will be able to be armed.
[01:01:12.521 --> 01:01:14.361]  We're going to take all guns.
[01:01:14.401 --> 01:01:19.263]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[01:01:19.283 --> 01:01:20.704]  Global governance at last.
[01:01:20.784 --> 01:01:21.744]  Is it one world?
[01:01:21.764 --> 01:01:23.405]  The central bank is in charge.
[01:01:23.465 --> 01:01:26.946]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[01:01:27.026 --> 01:01:31.027]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[01:01:33.348 --> 01:01:38.030]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:01:43.427 --> 01:01:44.888]  Hillary Clinton is desperate.
[01:01:45.828 --> 01:01:53.772]  Donald Trump was 10 points ahead in the polls until Reuters and others began sampling 10 to 15 percent more Democrats in their polls to skew the numbers.
[01:01:54.052 --> 01:01:54.632]  It's incredible.
[01:01:54.912 --> 01:02:04.097]  But despite all that skewing in the last two weeks, now in major polls put up by the very same groups with the same methodology, Trump is neck and neck with her or even a point or two ahead.
[01:02:04.617 --> 01:02:10.040]  But if you go look at the social media, and Breitbart and Gateway Pundit have done this, it's incredible.
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:20.063]  We're talking three, four, five, six times the support at places like Facebook, Livestream, Reddit, and so many other places.
[01:02:20.303 --> 01:02:24.185]  In fact, sometimes he's got ten times more likes and ten times more views.
[01:02:24.825 --> 01:02:28.606]  That's what we saw with Bernie Sanders, where he'd have 20,000 people, Hillary'd have 500.
[01:02:29.407 --> 01:02:38.030]  We did exit polls in California and other so-called battleground states in the Democratic primary, and we talked to eight people before we found one or two Hillary supporters.
[01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:41.836]  That's why Hillary was forced to steal it with the superdelegates.
[01:02:42.477 --> 01:02:44.080]  Let's look at some of the numbers themselves.
[01:02:45.003 --> 01:02:49.886]  Trump had 10 million plus likes to Clinton's 5 million on Facebook.
[01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:58.130]  And that's with Facebook admittedly censoring Trump pages everywhere they can, and even meeting with Hillary Clinton just like Google does.
[01:02:59.031 --> 01:03:06.875]  Trump averages 30,000 live viewers per stream, and Clinton averages 500 live stream viewers per stream.
[01:03:07.315 --> 01:03:09.256]  On Reddit, Trump averages 197,000 plus subscribers, Hillary 24,000.
[01:03:13.018 --> 01:03:16.620]  Hillary for prison has 55,000 subscribers.
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.161]  Gee, wonder who started that.
[01:03:18.781 --> 01:03:22.763]  And this is only a snapshot of the numbers we're seeing with Trump.
[01:03:23.203 --> 01:03:26.765]  You go to YouTube, his average video has millions of views.
[01:03:27.785 --> 01:03:32.668]  You go look at Hillary's official campaign site, most of her videos have 2,000 or 3,000 views.
[01:03:32.728 --> 01:03:34.189]  Her bigger one's a few hundred thousand.
[01:03:34.529 --> 01:03:35.689]  This lady's a joke.
[01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:37.410]  She's not liked by her own party.
[01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:40.372]  But we're being told it's going to be a landslide for her.
[01:03:41.252 --> 01:03:44.374]  Because they're trying to get us ready for election fraud.
[01:03:44.774 --> 01:03:47.895]  Something so well documented in this country's past.
[01:03:49.076 --> 01:03:53.398]  But Obama says it's preposterous he doesn't even know what that is.
[01:03:54.199 --> 01:03:56.180]  Well, President Obama, we do know what it is.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:02.843]  And this time, we don't have somebody like Mitt Romney or John McCain who's going to stand down and not take action.
[01:04:03.163 --> 01:04:05.324]  We don't have somebody who's going to throw in the towel there's fraud.
[01:04:05.585 --> 01:04:09.827]  We've got Donald Trump and an awake population that's aware of your scams.
[01:04:10.902 --> 01:04:12.543]  The social engineers have jumped the shark.
[01:04:12.983 --> 01:04:14.985]  They are stealing this election in front of everyone.
[01:04:15.865 --> 01:04:19.688]  By forcing them to engage in fraud, we are exposing them forever.
[01:04:20.028 --> 01:04:35.358]  So even if Donald Trump loses, even if that happens due to fraud or scandals, it doesn't matter because we've been in the arena, we've politically exposed the system, political correctness, globalism, the maxim has been introduced, Americanism, not globalism.
[01:04:36.189 --> 01:04:38.250]  This is a good time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:44.694]  And we owe Donald Trump so much for being willing to put his family, his life, his treasure on the line.
[01:04:45.094 --> 01:04:46.335]  He is the man in the arena.
[01:04:46.915 --> 01:04:48.696]  And I'm honored to be in that arena with him as well.
[01:04:49.176 --> 01:04:53.759]  If you haven't joined us in this historic fight, it's time to pick a side right now.
[01:05:00.066 --> 01:05:01.347]  And by the way, more good news.
[01:05:01.947 --> 01:05:04.769]  Donald Trump is giving a very powerful speech right now.
[01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:09.832]  It's live on Fox News and other channels in Detroit on how he plans to rebuild our economy.
[01:05:10.312 --> 01:05:11.693]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:05:11.953 --> 01:05:13.254]  You can't survive without it.
[01:05:13.434 --> 01:05:14.335]  But where do you get it?
[01:05:14.635 --> 01:05:20.418]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:05:20.639 --> 01:05:26.362]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:05:26.542 --> 01:05:43.406]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:05:43.786 --> 01:05:45.907]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[01:05:46.268 --> 01:05:47.468]  Stainless steel construction.
[01:05:47.748 --> 01:05:48.529]  Easy assembly.
[01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:49.409]  Low maintenance.
[01:05:49.689 --> 01:05:51.531]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:11.662]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:06:11.722 --> 01:06:13.602]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:06:13.742 --> 01:06:16.583]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:06:16.643 --> 01:06:22.505]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:06:22.705 --> 01:06:30.068]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[01:06:30.228 --> 01:06:31.589]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:06:31.889 --> 01:06:39.152]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:06:39.432 --> 01:06:47.155]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:06:47.455 --> 01:06:48.416]  The general public doesn't.
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:51.963]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:06:53.025 --> 01:06:56.990]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:06:57.170 --> 01:07:03.938]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:07:04.179 --> 01:07:08.284]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:20.569]  Video from Donald Trump's speech in Daytona Beach last week shows ABC News cutting the live feed as Trump begins to talk about Hillary Clinton's connections to ISIS, as reported by Paul Joseph Watson of InfoWars.com.
[01:07:20.729 --> 01:07:28.395]  Before the feed was cut, Trump said, quote, And we let ISIS take this position.
[01:07:28.515 --> 01:07:29.616]  It was Hillary Clinton that.
[01:07:29.636 --> 01:07:32.618]  She should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS.
[01:07:32.859 --> 01:07:37.022]  And right after Trump made that statement, ABC News cut the feed and went to background music.
[01:07:37.242 --> 01:07:40.744]  ABC isn't the only network to cut the feed when someone's critical of Hillary.
[01:07:40.885 --> 01:07:50.391]  Last month, for example, CNN cut its own feed when a reporter pointed out that Hillary's support for anti-crime legislation in the 90s led to the mass incarceration of African Americans.
[01:07:50.791 --> 01:07:59.317]  And, Hillary's support of jihadists in the Middle East, particularly in Libya and Syria while serving as Secretary of State, has directly led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Muslims.
[01:07:59.537 --> 01:08:03.602]  The fact that mainstream media keeps downplaying while claiming Trump is, quote, Islamophobic.
[01:08:03.822 --> 01:08:06.685]  And to find out more, visit InfoWars.com.
[01:08:06.805 --> 01:08:08.187]  This is Kit Angels reporting.
[01:08:14.273 --> 01:08:16.856]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:21.517 --> 01:08:37.665]  By the way, while we've been fighting to expose the election fraud already going on in the primaries and now into the general election, and as that becomes one of the top stories in the world, and the globalists do not like the fact that they don't control the narrative, Donald Trump is there exposing the planned deindustrialization of the United States.
[01:08:37.725 --> 01:08:46.510]  The globalists sold out our interest and own and control and run the factories in China, India, Mexico, and 160 plus other third world nations.
[01:08:47.230 --> 01:08:50.813]  And it doesn't even benefit the Mexicans or the Chinese or others on average.
[01:08:51.834 --> 01:08:53.455]  No environmental standards, no nothing.
[01:08:53.956 --> 01:08:55.857]  All these regulations, all these controls here.
[01:08:57.458 --> 01:08:58.679]  More expensive electricity.
[01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:00.021]  We cannot compete.
[01:09:01.242 --> 01:09:03.924]  It's a miracle we've got any industry left.
[01:09:05.267 --> 01:09:09.470]  We've been de-industrialized about 86% from what we were in the 1960s.
[01:09:10.151 --> 01:09:10.912]  This is serious.
[01:09:10.952 --> 01:09:13.694]  If a nation can't build, it can't do anything.
[01:09:14.014 --> 01:09:16.917]  So let's go to Trump in the middle of his speech.
[01:09:18.098 --> 01:09:21.000]  They actually said it when I ran for political office.
[01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:22.121]  It's not going to happen.
[01:09:22.381 --> 01:09:23.542]  He's never done it before.
[01:09:24.543 --> 01:09:25.063]  It happened.
[01:09:26.945 --> 01:09:31.989]  America is ready to prove the doubters wrong.
[01:09:33.070 --> 01:09:33.951]  They want you
[01:09:35.011 --> 01:09:35.912]  To think small.
[01:09:36.653 --> 01:09:38.836]  I am asking you to think big.
[01:09:39.757 --> 01:09:45.143]  We are ready to dream great things for our country once again.
[01:09:45.844 --> 01:09:50.950]  We are ready to show the world that America is back.
[01:09:51.977 --> 01:09:58.045]  Bigger and better and stronger than ever before.
[01:09:58.426 --> 01:09:59.247]  Thank you very much.
[01:09:59.287 --> 01:09:59.988]  God bless you.
[01:10:00.028 --> 01:10:00.468]  Thank you.
[01:10:01.049 --> 01:10:01.410]  Thank you.
[01:10:02.010 --> 01:10:02.591]  Thank you very much.
[01:10:02.691 --> 01:10:04.253]  All right, I wanted you to see the end of it.
[01:10:04.794 --> 01:10:06.236]  Let's go back to the start now.
[01:10:07.137 --> 01:10:10.559]  And obviously throughout the broadcast we're going to be playing excerpts of them, but let's go back.
[01:10:10.839 --> 01:10:12.460]  That was from the Communist News Network.
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:18.623]  We wanted to see their feed because a lot of times they'll just cut it if they don't like what's being said, as ABC News and others have been caught doing.
[01:10:18.903 --> 01:10:20.384]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[01:10:20.844 --> 01:10:23.485]  Alexa now wants to have smart systems in your house.
[01:10:23.705 --> 01:10:25.806]  That's Amazon that run your home and spy on you.
[01:10:26.827 --> 01:10:32.730]  And of course they're the ones that fix and game all of the internet numbers to try to bankrupt anybody right of Satan.
[01:10:33.550 --> 01:10:34.991]  So we're going to be breaking that down as well.
[01:10:35.451 --> 01:10:39.232]  And an incredible article that Billy Corgan sent me this morning, he said, have you seen this?
[01:10:39.292 --> 01:10:42.973]  And I texted him back and I said, yeah, it's all over the place.
[01:10:42.993 --> 01:10:46.054]  They're saying that they should take the gloves off, be deceptive, the media should lie.
[01:10:46.454 --> 01:10:49.815]  He texted me back and he said, Alex, you're missing the boat here.
[01:10:49.916 --> 01:10:54.357]  They're openly saying in the article they should shut us down and not let us have free speech.
[01:10:55.477 --> 01:10:56.178]  And he's correct.
[01:10:57.058 --> 01:10:58.118]  Jim Ruttenberg.
[01:10:58.799 --> 01:11:02.240]  I mean, that's how crazy this is getting.
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:02.840]  Let me just give you.
[01:11:04.022 --> 01:11:04.902]  Morgan's actual quote.
[01:11:05.462 --> 01:11:06.263]  I don't want to butcher it.
[01:11:07.623 --> 01:11:29.529]  Not to quibble, as you've been reading this landscape for longer than I, but I think you're missing a major point, which is the cleaving point, as signaled by the New York Times piece I sent you, and others like it, is to permanently delegitimize not only opposition, but alternate media and thought, and ensure that any victory in that direction should be nulled or made void.
[01:11:31.815 --> 01:11:33.736]  Obama says you're not allowed to have Trump.
[01:11:33.877 --> 01:11:34.897]  I have disqualified him.
[01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:36.818]  The Pope says that.
[01:11:36.838 --> 01:11:39.139]  The Communist Chinese president says that.
[01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:40.780]  The Mexican president says that.
[01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:43.722]  And then they openly tried to steal the nomination from him.
[01:11:43.742 --> 01:11:44.863]  They stole it from Sanders.
[01:11:46.103 --> 01:11:54.808]  They've got this secretive national voting pool that AP runs, that announced all these states for Hillary she lost, that's going to be announcing things.
[01:11:54.848 --> 01:11:57.169]  And it's been caught in every major election.
[01:11:57.390 --> 01:11:59.711]  The article, the 12 minute investigative report.
[01:12:00.854 --> 01:12:02.075]  Is on Infowars.com.
[01:12:02.435 --> 01:12:06.977]  Obama slips up, exposes secret group running US elections.
[01:12:09.038 --> 01:12:12.180]  Again, I'm going to have that red link because it's so incredibly important.
[01:12:14.441 --> 01:12:21.585]  And we show in there every election where they engaged in fraud and threw the election the way the establishment wanted.
[01:12:21.905 --> 01:12:24.107]  In the past, though, the Democrats and Republicans would share power.
[01:12:24.407 --> 01:12:28.349]  That's why the Republicans and Democrats are combined forces against Trump at the top right now.
[01:12:30.356 --> 01:12:39.361]  Because their duopoly, their two-headed monster, one body, their system is being exposed.
[01:12:39.381 --> 01:12:40.122]  They're not invincible.
[01:12:40.302 --> 01:12:41.843]  So they're pulling out all the stops.
[01:12:42.563 --> 01:12:43.824]  People say, well, they may steal it from him.
[01:12:44.184 --> 01:12:46.686]  We still win by engaging instead of just lying here.
[01:12:47.026 --> 01:12:56.612]  Thanks to Trump, we've got a candidate, we've got the nominee who beat all the odds with the people to defeat them.
[01:12:58.885 --> 01:13:00.727]  And to have such landslides, they couldn't steal it.
[01:13:02.948 --> 01:13:05.991]  And now they are twisting everything he says.
[01:13:06.351 --> 01:13:08.013]  They are openly saying he's disqualified.
[01:13:08.053 --> 01:13:09.834]  He quit every dirty trick.
[01:13:09.854 --> 01:13:10.895]  His wife's a whore.
[01:13:11.335 --> 01:13:11.876]  Blah, blah.
[01:13:12.016 --> 01:13:12.937]  All these lies.
[01:13:12.977 --> 01:13:13.898]  He's an illegal alien?
[01:13:18.381 --> 01:13:21.844]  The hypocrisy of these people is unbelievable.
[01:13:23.866 --> 01:13:25.627]  And they go back to all his liberal stances.
[01:13:26.693 --> 01:13:28.934]  And say, oh, he's double-crossing conservatives.
[01:13:29.535 --> 01:13:31.896]  You wouldn't be scared of him if he was double-crossing.
[01:13:33.757 --> 01:13:40.321]  No, the truth is, he's a populist, he's liberal on some issues, but he's Americana and wants us to have a fair shake.
[01:13:40.361 --> 01:13:43.582]  He isn't out to get America, and the New World Order knows that.
[01:13:43.622 --> 01:13:46.444]  He's about Americanism, not globalism.
[01:13:49.758 --> 01:13:51.239]  I want to play some of this Trump speech.
[01:13:51.399 --> 01:14:11.067]  Let's go to Detroit, Michigan, the Rust Belt, and let's hear Donald Trump talking about dreaming big and putting America first, not using America's money and engine and industry to build this worldwide government for the globalists that they don't use to bring in peace as they sold it, but as a combine to consolidate global control and have a corporate empire.
[01:14:12.767 --> 01:14:16.409]  Our industry was sold off to the world to establish all these systems.
[01:14:19.807 --> 01:14:22.489]  We could turn our economy back on, like that.
[01:14:23.049 --> 01:14:25.571]  We could bring in skilled labor, like that.
[01:14:26.192 --> 01:14:28.253]  We could ride our ticket, like that.
[01:14:29.594 --> 01:14:32.236]  We could stop having our industry be a prison, like that.
[01:14:33.777 --> 01:14:42.123]  We could stop all the race war garbage and all the cops out of control and the people killing cops, like that, with culture, with bringing people together, with honor.
[01:14:42.884 --> 01:14:43.364]  Snap your fingers.
[01:14:45.754 --> 01:14:47.174]  Snap your fingers, snap your neck.
[01:14:47.454 --> 01:14:47.935]  Real easy.
[01:14:48.235 --> 01:14:49.035]  Snap the neck of tyranny.
[01:14:49.435 --> 01:14:49.755]  Like that.
[01:14:49.995 --> 01:14:50.735]  You just gotta wanna do it.
[01:14:53.796 --> 01:14:55.957]  Freedom's like selling snow cones in hell.
[01:14:57.257 --> 01:14:59.518]  It's like selling people blankets in the Antarctic.
[01:15:00.798 --> 01:15:02.759]  It ain't hard to sell compared to tyranny.
[01:15:03.159 --> 01:15:04.859]  You want starving kids with their ribs sticking out?
[01:15:05.119 --> 01:15:07.540]  Little fat dictators waddling around like Kim Jong-un?
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:10.821]  That can't even produce electricity for 99% of the country?
[01:15:15.049 --> 01:15:22.490]  You look at that craved, weird, power-tripped, demonic look in his eyes, and you look at that State Department spokesman in Gibbs' eyes when they're lying to the public.
[01:15:23.471 --> 01:15:24.991]  Can we queue up the entire State Department clip?
[01:15:25.011 --> 01:15:26.391]  I want to play that coming up in the next segment.
[01:15:26.651 --> 01:15:28.292]  But right now, let's go to Donald Trump.
[01:15:28.312 --> 01:15:29.272]  Here it is in Detroit today.
[01:15:29.672 --> 01:15:30.332]  Just finish the speech.
[01:15:34.333 --> 01:15:35.233]  Thank you, everybody.
[01:15:35.273 --> 01:15:36.153]  Thank you very much.
[01:15:39.374 --> 01:15:39.734]  Thank you.
[01:15:43.641 --> 01:15:44.382]  Such a crowd.
[01:15:44.462 --> 01:15:44.882]  Beautiful.
[01:15:44.942 --> 01:15:45.803]  Thank you very much.
[01:15:46.623 --> 01:15:47.083]  Thank you.
[01:15:49.765 --> 01:15:50.186]  Thank you.
[01:15:50.786 --> 01:15:51.106]  Please.
[01:15:54.068 --> 01:15:57.450]  Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today.
[01:15:58.251 --> 01:16:00.613]  It's wonderful to be in Detroit.
[01:16:01.393 --> 01:16:02.374]  Been here many times.
[01:16:07.113 --> 01:16:14.735]  We now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America.
[01:16:15.855 --> 01:16:27.998]  It's a conversation about how to make America great again for everyone, especially, and I say especially, for those who have the very least.
[01:16:29.879 --> 01:16:34.060]  The city of Detroit is where our story begins.
[01:16:35.663 --> 01:16:38.804]  Detroit was once the economic envy of the world.
[01:16:39.385 --> 01:16:47.108]  The people of Detroit helped to power America to its position of global dominance in the 20th century.
[01:16:50.029 --> 01:16:50.970]  Disruptors.
[01:16:51.010 --> 01:16:53.331]  We will shut our speech down.
[01:16:53.371 --> 01:16:54.511]  New York Times has called for it.
[01:17:04.907 --> 01:17:05.728]  Unprecedented evil.
[01:17:06.669 --> 01:17:07.610]  And they've called for Trump's death.
[01:17:08.691 --> 01:17:11.254]  All because he'd point out that we've been conquered by globalism.
[01:17:13.302 --> 01:17:19.626]  When we were governed by the America First policy, Detroit was absolutely booming.
[01:17:20.506 --> 01:17:35.115]  Engineers, builders, laborers, shippers, and countless others went to work each day, provided for their families, and lived out, totally lived out, the American dream.
[01:17:35.276 --> 01:17:38.778]  But for many living in this city, that dream
[01:17:39.358 --> 01:17:39.899]  Vacations.
[01:17:39.999 --> 01:17:40.360]  College.
[01:17:50.854 --> 01:18:02.602]  The skyscrapers went up in Beijing and many other cities around the world, while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled right here in Detroit.
[01:18:02.682 --> 01:18:13.629]  Our roads and bridges fell into disrepair, yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense.
[01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:25.941]  Today, Detroit has per capita income of under $15,000, about half of the national average.
[01:18:25.961 --> 01:18:31.904]  40% of the city's residents live in poverty, over two and a half times the national average.
[01:18:31.924 --> 01:18:33.664]  By the way, they're making $15,000 on average in the 60s there.
[01:18:33.684 --> 01:18:37.746]  The unemployment rate is more than twice the national average.
[01:18:38.926 --> 01:18:42.708]  Half of all Detroit residents do not work.
[01:18:44.076 --> 01:18:50.438]  Detroit tops the list of the most dangerous cities in terms of violent crime.
[01:18:52.358 --> 01:18:53.518]  Another communist disruptor.
[01:18:53.838 --> 01:18:56.419]  The New York Times is calling for shutting free speech down.
[01:18:56.439 --> 01:19:03.021]  Alexa has already been caught racketeering, shutting down any opposition online, delisting and trying to bankrupt people.
[01:19:03.181 --> 01:19:04.401]  Total criminal ops, folks.
[01:19:04.681 --> 01:19:05.121]  They're moving.
[01:19:05.841 --> 01:19:06.282]  They're moving.
[01:19:06.302 --> 01:19:08.602]  If we don't stop them now, it's over.
[01:19:08.622 --> 01:19:11.023]  They'll get to the Supreme Court and they're going to start arresting everybody.
[01:19:11.043 --> 01:19:11.623]  They said they are.
[01:19:13.206 --> 01:19:17.609]  Detroit tops the list of most dangerous cities in terms of violent crime.
[01:19:18.429 --> 01:19:28.815]  These are silenced victims whose stories are never told by Hillary Clinton, but victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent.
[01:19:28.956 --> 01:19:30.196]  All right, we're going to hit pause and come back.
[01:19:30.236 --> 01:19:31.577]  We're going to play some more of this.
[01:19:32.578 --> 01:19:35.219]  Again, we ended with the end of his speech live.
[01:19:35.259 --> 01:19:36.880]  We're going back through it right now.
[01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:37.621]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:19:37.641 --> 01:19:41.623]  This is obviously the Monday Worldwide Broadcast, the eighth day of August 2016.
[01:19:43.837 --> 01:19:47.560]  If you think cops have problems now, or you have a problem with cops now, wait till they've been globalized.
[01:19:47.961 --> 01:19:54.226]  The attack on police is about bullying them to go under globalist control, under the Strong Cities Initiative.
[01:19:54.847 --> 01:20:04.035]  And then there are going to be political police, just like you see them in Oregon, and other areas, where they allow the anti-Trump people to beat up women, to bloody pulps.
[01:20:04.055 --> 01:20:06.718]  And when the police are asked to do something, they laugh at you.
[01:20:07.458 --> 01:20:09.140]  These are evil, evil people.
[01:20:20.421 --> 01:20:21.842]  Hillary Clinton is desperate.
[01:20:22.783 --> 01:20:30.729]  Donald Trump was 10 points ahead in the polls until Reuters and others began sampling 10 to 15 percent more Democrats in their polls to skew the numbers.
[01:20:31.029 --> 01:20:31.590]  It's incredible.
[01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:41.077]  But despite all that skewing in the last two weeks, now in major polls put up by the very same groups with the same methodology, Trump is neck and neck with her or even a point or two ahead.
[01:20:41.597 --> 01:20:47.022]  But if you go look at the social media, and Breitbart and Gateway Pundit have done this, it's incredible.
[01:20:47.722 --> 01:20:57.030]  We're talking three, four, five, six times the support at places like Facebook, Livestream, Reddit, and so many other places.
[01:20:57.290 --> 01:21:01.174]  In fact, sometimes he's got ten times more likes and ten times more views.
[01:21:01.814 --> 01:21:05.597]  That's what we saw with Bernie Sanders, where he'd have 20,000 people, Hillary'd have 500.
[01:21:06.378 --> 01:21:15.026]  We did exit polls in California and other so-called battleground states in the Democratic primary, and we talked to eight people before we found one or two Hillary supporters.
[01:21:15.586 --> 01:21:18.807]  That's why Hillary was forced to steal it with the superdelegates.
[01:21:19.467 --> 01:21:21.067]  Let's look at some of the numbers themselves.
[01:21:21.988 --> 01:21:26.869]  Trump had 10 million plus likes to Clinton's 5 million on Facebook.
[01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:35.051]  And that's with Facebook admittedly censoring Trump pages everywhere they can and even meeting with Hillary Clinton just like Google does.
[01:21:36.013 --> 01:21:43.835]  Trump averages 30,000 live viewers per stream, and Clinton averages 500 live stream viewers per stream.
[01:21:44.275 --> 01:21:48.676]  On Reddit, Trump averages 197,000 plus subscribers, Hillary 24,000.
[01:21:49.156 --> 01:21:53.597]  Hillary for prison has 55,000 subscribers.
[01:21:53.857 --> 01:21:55.138]  Gee, wonder who started that.
[01:21:55.738 --> 01:21:59.739]  And this is only a snapshot of the numbers we're seeing with Trump.
[01:22:00.159 --> 01:22:03.700]  You go to YouTube, his average video has millions of views.
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:07.162]  You go look at Hillary's official campaign site.
[01:22:07.723 --> 01:22:09.645]  Most of her videos have 2,000 or 3,000 views.
[01:22:09.685 --> 01:22:11.146]  Her bigger one's a few hundred thousand.
[01:22:11.486 --> 01:22:12.647]  This lady's a joke.
[01:22:13.028 --> 01:22:14.369]  She's not liked by her own party.
[01:22:14.689 --> 01:22:21.355]  But we're being told it's going to be a landslide for her because they're trying to get us ready for election fraud.
[01:22:21.736 --> 01:22:24.839]  Something so well documented in this country's past.
[01:22:26.052 --> 01:22:30.377]  But Obama says, it's preposterous, he doesn't even know what that is.
[01:22:31.178 --> 01:22:33.140]  Well, President Obama, we do know what it is.
[01:22:33.941 --> 01:22:39.827]  And this time, we don't have somebody like Mitt Romney or John McCain who's going to stand down and not take action.
[01:22:40.127 --> 01:22:42.290]  We don't have somebody who's going to throw in the towel there's fraud.
[01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:46.814]  We've got Donald Trump and an awake population that's aware of your scams.
[01:22:47.881 --> 01:22:49.542]  The social engineers have jumped the shark.
[01:22:49.942 --> 01:22:51.963]  They are stealing this election in front of everyone.
[01:22:52.844 --> 01:22:56.666]  By forcing them to engage in fraud, we are exposing them forever.
[01:22:57.006 --> 01:23:12.335]  So even if Donald Trump loses, even if that happens due to fraud or scandals, it doesn't matter because we've been in the arena, we've politically exposed the system, political correctness, globalism, the maxim has been introduced, Americanism, not globalism.
[01:23:13.171 --> 01:23:15.233]  This is a good time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:15.594 --> 01:23:21.661]  And we owe Donald Trump so much for being willing to put his family, his life, his treasure on the line.
[01:23:22.082 --> 01:23:23.323]  He is the man of the arena.
[01:23:23.904 --> 01:23:25.666]  And I'm honored to be in that arena with him as well.
[01:23:26.146 --> 01:23:30.732]  If you haven't joined us in this historic fight, it's time to pick a side right now.
[01:23:41.389 --> 01:23:42.930]  Our talk show host is Alex Jones.
[01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:44.872]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[01:23:44.952 --> 01:23:47.674]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[01:23:47.874 --> 01:23:48.695]  Alex Jones.
[01:23:48.775 --> 01:23:51.537]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:23:51.597 --> 01:23:54.800]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:56.161]  Deeply I think racist.
[01:23:56.261 --> 01:23:58.102]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[01:23:58.202 --> 01:24:00.004]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[01:24:00.024 --> 01:24:04.107]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[01:24:04.127 --> 01:24:05.288]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:05.348 --> 01:24:10.252]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:24:14.065 --> 01:24:15.586]  They railed against the crown.
[01:24:15.606 --> 01:24:16.667]  Another ragtag band.
[01:24:16.707 --> 01:24:17.848]  Another ragtag band.
[01:24:19.289 --> 01:24:19.910]  Declaring.
[01:24:19.930 --> 01:24:22.312]  They laid their bodies down in a bloody war.
[01:24:22.352 --> 01:24:22.992]  For liberty.
[01:24:23.012 --> 01:24:24.434]  For their descendants.
[01:24:42.894 --> 01:24:44.796]  I can let him down.
[01:24:47.058 --> 01:24:48.199]  Stand with your ancestors.
[01:24:49.721 --> 01:24:52.003]  Lord knows those selling evil are standing with theirs.
[01:24:56.407 --> 01:25:01.372]  People think the avoidance of conflict and submitting is life.
[01:25:02.633 --> 01:25:03.914]  What it is is pure death.
[01:25:05.476 --> 01:25:06.817]  No one knows who first said it.
[01:25:08.374 --> 01:25:14.258]  It's been said for thousands of years, it's better to die on your feet than live on your knees.
[01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:21.303]  Actor James Wood says, what's the Vegas line on Julian Assange actually staying alive until the election?
[01:25:21.723 --> 01:25:27.908]  Yeah, I think Assange is really asking for it, not releasing the information.
[01:25:27.928 --> 01:25:29.769]  He says, we'll quote, get Hillary indicted.
[01:25:31.442 --> 01:25:33.163]  And the media is attacking Matt Drudge.
[01:25:33.764 --> 01:25:37.006]  Oh, that was a photo of Hillary falling down the stairs a month ago.
[01:25:37.646 --> 01:25:43.090]  Well, a new site just pointed out she's fallen down going upstairs and she's acting completely insane and had blood clots in her brain.
[01:25:43.130 --> 01:25:45.951]  It looks like she has Parkinson's and has lesions on her tongue.
[01:25:45.991 --> 01:25:50.134]  And, you know, the Secret Service says it's always attacking people and foaming at the mouth.
[01:25:50.194 --> 01:25:52.536]  And I mean, if Trump was doing this, it'd be a big issue.
[01:25:53.736 --> 01:25:57.479]  Let's go back to Donald J. Trump in Detroit earlier.
[01:25:59.616 --> 01:26:08.380]  Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent's failed economic agenda.
[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:10.461]  It's not failed, it's globalism.
[01:26:10.621 --> 01:26:11.481]  They set up a world government.
[01:26:17.024 --> 01:26:25.608]  Every policy that has failed this city, and so many others, is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton.
[01:26:26.542 --> 01:26:30.682]  She supports the high taxes and radical regulation.
[01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:33.550]  That forced jobs out of your community.
[01:26:34.191 --> 01:26:39.132]  And the crime policies have made you far, far less safe.
[01:26:39.792 --> 01:26:52.995]  And the immigration policies that have strained local budgets, and the trade deals like NAFTA, signed by her husband, that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries.
[01:26:53.715 --> 01:27:00.117]  And she supports the education policies that deny your students choice
[01:27:01.144 --> 01:27:03.227]  Freedom and opportunity.
[01:27:09.134 --> 01:27:11.237]  She is the candidate of the past.
[01:27:12.118 --> 01:27:14.441]  Ours is the campaign of the future.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:25.322]  This is a city controlled by democratic politicians at every level.
[01:27:25.922 --> 01:27:31.304]  And unless we change policies, we will not change results 100%.
[01:27:32.585 --> 01:27:41.908]  Today I will outline my economic vision.
[01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:50.132]  In the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies and the ones we have already rolled out
[01:27:55.993 --> 01:27:56.773]  More disruptions.
[01:28:01.574 --> 01:28:10.416]  It's sabotage, folk!
[01:28:10.436 --> 01:28:11.357]  Thank you, everybody.
[01:28:15.118 --> 01:28:18.198]  This is what happens when you go from 35 people to close to 2,000 people, I guess.
[01:28:21.812 --> 01:28:33.456]  In the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies, and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website.
[01:28:34.056 --> 01:28:39.038]  Our opposition, on the other hand, has long ago run out of ideas.
[01:28:39.978 --> 01:28:43.120]  All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:52.284]  More taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and on American production.
[01:28:52.764 --> 01:28:53.985]  More of that.
[01:28:55.406 --> 01:29:03.790]  If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda.
[01:29:09.332 --> 01:29:10.873]  That's right, it's sabotage.
[01:29:10.893 --> 01:29:21.640]  Nothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs right out of existence.
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:23.561]  And to have electricity three times more than China.
[01:29:23.581 --> 01:29:31.887]  The most important feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States.
[01:29:32.627 --> 01:29:33.228]  That's globalism.
[01:29:33.268 --> 01:29:35.189]  How do you bring down America?
[01:29:36.963 --> 01:29:37.463]  We've all seen it.
[01:29:37.483 --> 01:29:42.664]  The policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expense.
[01:29:42.684 --> 01:29:43.484]  Alright, we're going to go to break.
[01:29:43.844 --> 01:29:51.726]  And that's why she tries... We're going to back this up a little bit when we come back and play a few more minutes before our next guest joins us and a lot of other news we're going to be breaking.
[01:29:52.346 --> 01:29:56.267]  Not surprisingly, today the Communist Party has come out and endorsed Hillary Clinton.
[01:29:57.047 --> 01:29:58.427]  So you'll want to know that.
[01:29:59.808 --> 01:30:00.708]  We're on the march.
[01:30:01.188 --> 01:30:02.788]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.708 --> 01:30:06.369]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:14.401]  Hey, you voting for Hillary Clinton?
[01:30:14.421 --> 01:30:16.242]  So what are your big issues?
[01:30:16.302 --> 01:30:17.283]  Are you for gun control?
[01:30:17.964 --> 01:30:18.284]  Yes.
[01:30:18.885 --> 01:30:19.685]  Eliminate him!
[01:30:20.045 --> 01:30:22.027]  Take him out of the hands of the people!
[01:30:23.388 --> 01:30:24.609]  I trust Hillary!
[01:30:24.869 --> 01:30:25.770]  Hillary's the best!
[01:30:26.050 --> 01:30:26.771]  Go Hillary!
[01:30:27.211 --> 01:30:27.812]  Disturbing.
[01:30:27.832 --> 01:30:28.492]  Disturbing?
[01:30:30.914 --> 01:30:31.715]  Who are you voting for?
[01:30:32.355 --> 01:30:33.236]  Who am I voting for?
[01:30:33.276 --> 01:30:33.576]  Yeah.
[01:30:33.876 --> 01:30:35.137]  Clinton!
[01:30:35.158 --> 01:30:36.619]  Uh, I ain't giving you no change.
[01:30:40.126 --> 01:30:40.727]  Vote for Hillary.
[01:30:40.807 --> 01:30:42.588]  Trump is not gonna get the vote.
[01:30:42.668 --> 01:30:43.228]  Disturbing.
[01:30:43.768 --> 01:30:48.211]  Alright, we got the peace Bernie bike coming down here.
[01:30:49.032 --> 01:30:52.114]  Uh, yeah, Bernie is, like, the best candidate I've seen.
[01:30:52.134 --> 01:30:57.137]  People are trying to climb over the fence now to get in to where the DNC is taking place.
[01:30:57.437 --> 01:30:59.819]  Of course they tried to shut him down because it's rigged.
[01:30:59.839 --> 01:31:02.120]  As far as I'm concerned, there, she's clear.
[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:04.922]  Hillary Clinton is cleared from all charges.
[01:31:05.542 --> 01:31:07.745]  And I am for gun control.
[01:31:08.065 --> 01:31:14.532]  You don't have our vote, you don't have our money, and Trump's gonna flatten you like a pancake, Hillary.
[01:31:14.552 --> 01:31:17.455]  Obama's totally awesome, we're gonna miss him.
[01:31:17.475 --> 01:31:20.017]  F you, Hillary Clinton.
[01:31:20.037 --> 01:31:23.141]  We're not voting for Hillary in no way, shape, form, or fashion.
[01:31:23.501 --> 01:31:24.102]  That's a wrap.
[01:31:24.162 --> 01:31:27.565]  Note, like, everything that she's done, everything that she's about.
[01:31:28.502 --> 01:31:30.023]  We can not just fall in line.
[01:31:30.383 --> 01:31:33.766]  No matter if Bernie's supporting her, I don't care who's supporting her.
[01:31:33.986 --> 01:31:34.786]  I'm not supporting her.
[01:31:34.887 --> 01:31:35.527]  And that's just that.
[01:31:36.408 --> 01:31:37.909]  She doesn't hold none of our values.
[01:31:37.969 --> 01:31:38.929]  She holds no one's values.
[01:31:38.949 --> 01:31:39.810]  She's not accountable.
[01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:41.531]  She's not held accountable for anything.
[01:31:41.891 --> 01:31:43.513]  She wasn't held accountable for the emails.
[01:31:44.013 --> 01:31:45.794]  She wasn't held accountable for Benghazi.
[01:31:46.094 --> 01:31:47.896]  She wasn't held accountable for Libya.
[01:31:48.136 --> 01:31:49.517]  She's not held accountable for anything.
[01:31:49.557 --> 01:31:52.739]  So nobody in their right mind should even think about voting for that lady.
[01:31:52.739 --> 01:31:59.165]  What do you think about the FBI director basically saying every reason why she was guilty, but then saying she should be let off?
[01:31:59.585 --> 01:32:03.869]  He was paid, or he knows that a hit team will come after him.
[01:32:03.929 --> 01:32:04.609]  That's what I believe.
[01:32:04.629 --> 01:32:05.911]  You think Bernie Sanders was paid off?
[01:32:06.311 --> 01:32:07.812]  No, I don't think Bernie was paid off.
[01:32:08.092 --> 01:32:10.455]  We're talking about Director James Comey.
[01:32:12.389 --> 01:32:13.489]  He knows something that we don't know.
[01:32:13.529 --> 01:32:15.510]  You know what I mean?
[01:32:15.610 --> 01:32:17.190]  Something happened.
[01:32:17.251 --> 01:32:20.151]  His life was threatened, I bet.
[01:32:20.311 --> 01:32:21.492]  Bernie's life was threatened.
[01:32:21.912 --> 01:32:29.574]  For him to do that, for him to say we're going to a contested convention, and then give in, for him to think that... I just can't fathom it.
[01:32:29.634 --> 01:32:31.035]  Like, I really can't fathom it anymore.
[01:32:31.055 --> 01:32:33.075]  Like, it's just crazy.
[01:32:33.095 --> 01:32:36.156]  Why do you think that the election was stolen?
[01:32:36.176 --> 01:32:40.438]  I mean, do you think that Hillary is there to... Eleven states that have reported election fraud.
[01:32:40.618 --> 01:32:41.398]  Eleven states.
[01:32:42.355 --> 01:32:44.275]  That goes beyond the margin of error.
[01:32:44.635 --> 01:32:46.136]  Why is Hillary doing this?
[01:32:46.316 --> 01:32:47.356]  Why is Hillary doing this?
[01:32:47.396 --> 01:32:48.416]  What's her game plan?
[01:32:49.256 --> 01:32:49.817]  Me personally?
[01:32:50.217 --> 01:32:51.657]  I think she wants to go to war with Russia.
[01:32:51.737 --> 01:32:52.397]  That's what I think.
[01:33:13.666 --> 01:33:15.847]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:16.368 --> 01:33:21.671]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:22.531 --> 01:33:37.740]  And we got sabotage going on against our economy, and Donald Trump just talked about it earlier, just about an hour ago or less, in Detroit.
[01:33:39.079 --> 01:33:41.661]  Why does Hillary and others need to actually make or produce anything?
[01:33:41.681 --> 01:33:43.643]  They can just make the deals to ship our jobs to China.
[01:33:45.745 --> 01:33:54.713]  Like Pacharia, the former head of the UN's carbon tax program, would have plants moved from England to India that he and his family actually owned once they got to India.
[01:33:56.795 --> 01:33:57.756]  Oh, it's sabotage.
[01:34:00.298 --> 01:34:01.139]  Oh, I know you planned it.
[01:34:03.381 --> 01:34:04.182]  And it's gonna stop.
[01:34:05.486 --> 01:34:08.328]  The great part about Trump is he's injecting all this truth out there.
[01:34:08.588 --> 01:34:24.319]  We're going to go to someone that really got mad at Trump because he wasn't endorsing Paul Ryan, the open borders, anti-gun, in many cases, free trade globalist, who wants secret TPP to be able to make these rules that Congress and the public can't even see until it's already rammed through.
[01:34:24.339 --> 01:34:29.682]  And depending on how the polls are, the point is that we need to get this guy elected.
[01:34:30.463 --> 01:34:32.965]  And there's been a lot of chicanery going on.
[01:34:32.985 --> 01:34:34.446]  The whole establishment is trying to defend
[01:34:35.366 --> 01:34:39.349]  Mr. Ryan, we're going to be talking to Paul Nealon here in just a moment.
[01:34:39.389 --> 01:34:40.229]  PaulNealon.com.
[01:34:40.509 --> 01:34:41.490]  First off, this ends.
[01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:42.691]  It's going for about a week and a half.
[01:34:42.751 --> 01:34:43.371]  It ends today.
[01:34:44.712 --> 01:34:52.357]  Free shipping on everything at InfowarsStore.com, whether it's the solar panel systems and their control units that are the very best, lowest prices out there.
[01:34:52.377 --> 01:34:52.797]  Check it out.
[01:34:53.157 --> 01:34:59.121]  Whether it's water filtration systems, whether it's super high quality
[01:35:00.322 --> 01:35:05.026]  Documentary films, and books, and videos, or nutraceuticals, supplements.
[01:35:05.046 --> 01:35:09.990]  40% off is going to have to end today, obviously, on Brain Force.
[01:35:10.010 --> 01:35:10.890]  That's about to sell out.
[01:35:11.891 --> 01:35:12.652]  Great nootropic.
[01:35:13.492 --> 01:35:18.176]  We are adding, though, a special that's going to be 40% off, and that's AnthroPlex.
[01:35:18.636 --> 01:35:24.301]  And that basically is just a dry formula of super male vitality, and it's just known herbs that
[01:35:25.353 --> 01:35:31.237]  With all the estrogen in the food chain, all the garbage out there that's feminizing everybody.
[01:35:31.637 --> 01:35:34.498]  This is an amazing, very affordable formula.
[01:35:34.558 --> 01:35:38.901]  Normally, at its regular price, now 40% off on Anthroplex.
[01:35:38.941 --> 01:35:40.202]  That is unprecedented.
[01:35:40.622 --> 01:35:43.324]  And your purchase makes the broadcast possible.
[01:35:43.864 --> 01:35:49.367]  And that's why we're able to reach 28 million people a week globally, about 15 million a week here in the United States.
[01:35:49.407 --> 01:35:51.829]  So free shipping ends today.
[01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:53.089]  I don't think so.
[01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:14.402]  Well, he needs more lawyers, as well as a record of restoring jobs in the American economy.
[01:36:14.622 --> 01:36:24.366]  Mr. Nealon is challenging the Speaker of the United States Representatives, that's Paul Ryan, in Wisconsin's first congressional district Republican primary election, August 9th.
[01:36:25.006 --> 01:36:26.046]  So that's coming up here.
[01:36:26.326 --> 01:36:26.586]  Boom!
[01:36:26.646 --> 01:36:32.949]  Tomorrow, Mr. Nealon serves as Senior Vice President of Operations for his company that leads the industry in water filtration.
[01:36:32.969 --> 01:36:33.809]  We were just talking about that.
[01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:38.011]  Disinfection technologies, or civilization, I would say.
[01:36:38.372 --> 01:36:49.778]  Since 2013, Mr. Nealon has served as an advisory board member of Operation Homefront, a Wisconsin non-profit organization with a strong record of bringing direct financial assistance to the families of active duty service members.
[01:36:49.838 --> 01:36:53.259]  Paul Nealon, N-E-H-L-E-N dot com.
[01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:55.120]  Everybody should get behind him.
[01:36:55.661 --> 01:36:57.702]  Just to put more heat, we already brought down the rhino.
[01:36:58.542 --> 01:37:04.648]  You know, who of course was installed by Newt Gingrich, and that was the former Speaker Boehner, or Crybaby.
[01:37:05.069 --> 01:37:07.691]  And then now we have Paul Ryan, who I guess is a handsome guy.
[01:37:08.412 --> 01:37:09.133]  Mr. Blue Eyes.
[01:37:09.213 --> 01:37:14.118]  But, you know, at the end of the day, a lot of people... I mean, I know Paul Nealon's story is interesting.
[01:37:14.158 --> 01:37:15.259]  I don't want to get it wrong.
[01:37:15.279 --> 01:37:15.900]  I remember hearing about it.
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:19.163]  The reason he started running against him was he was tired of being betrayed.
[01:37:19.223 --> 01:37:20.905]  Is that accurate, Mr. Nealon?
[01:37:22.063 --> 01:37:23.024]  Absolutely accurate.
[01:37:23.084 --> 01:37:24.406]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:37:25.307 --> 01:37:29.111]  You know, I believe Paul Ryan's schtick.
[01:37:29.211 --> 01:37:30.993]  He absolutely is.
[01:37:32.195 --> 01:37:33.176]  He's the head of the snake.
[01:37:33.416 --> 01:37:35.759]  Let's make no mistake about it.
[01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:42.186]  He absolutely is the most open borders, anti-worker,
[01:37:43.473 --> 01:37:49.996]  He's a pro-Wall Street member of Congress on either side of the aisle, and he is the head of the snake, and we're going to take him off.
[01:37:50.076 --> 01:37:57.700]  We are going to cut the head off the snake, because he absolutely has no moral qualms at all about shipping our jobs over to China.
[01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:07.185]  He is completely beholden to Wall Street, and we just don't pay well enough here in Wisconsin's first district.
[01:38:07.847 --> 01:38:23.660]  He gets paid a lot better by big corporations that do the bidding of maybe a thousand families in this country that enrich themselves over the destruction of America.
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:26.342]  Sure, well they fence the money too, but a lot of the money is foreign.
[01:38:26.362 --> 01:38:28.364]  Look at Hillary's foundation.
[01:38:28.384 --> 01:38:41.375]  I mean, get back to yourself and why you decided to go after this guy, because they've been selling him for a decade on conservative talk radio as this little angel of conservatism, but when you get into his actual votes, he's the opposite of that.
[01:38:42.398 --> 01:38:43.058]  That's exactly right.
[01:38:43.479 --> 01:38:56.264]  I'll out myself and say, hey, I was a Paul Ryan supporter until he came out as the mercenary champion of fast-track trade promotion authority for this Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[01:38:56.345 --> 01:39:03.448]  And when I read that, I read what Senator Sessions, God bless him, went out and reported on it.
[01:39:04.511 --> 01:39:08.753]  Alex, you know I had to go to the New Zealand government website.
[01:39:08.893 --> 01:39:14.696]  I had to go to the New Zealand website because our own government had that information hidden from us.
[01:39:15.316 --> 01:39:15.856]  And you know what?
[01:39:16.157 --> 01:39:23.920]  I found out that everything that Senator Sessions reported on was absolutely true by going to the New Zealand website.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.321]  Article 27 of TPP gives up U.S.
[01:39:26.361 --> 01:39:26.942]  sovereignty.
[01:39:27.842 --> 01:39:29.703]  It reduces the length of U.S.
[01:39:29.803 --> 01:39:30.303]  patents.
[01:39:30.703 --> 01:39:31.884]  I just got my fifth U.S.
[01:39:31.944 --> 01:39:33.525]  patent three weeks ago tomorrow.
[01:39:34.867 --> 01:39:39.531]  It gives H-1Bs and H-2Bs.
[01:39:39.571 --> 01:39:47.316]  We won't even be talking about H-1Bs and H-2Bs because foreign companies will be able to bring all the workers they want to this United States.
[01:39:47.336 --> 01:39:48.778]  It won't even be the United States anymore.
[01:39:48.798 --> 01:39:50.399]  It will be the United States of Asia.
[01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:59.788]  Paul Ryan is the globalist, soulless globalist head of the snake and that's why tomorrow we're going to cut the head of that snake off.
[01:40:00.289 --> 01:40:12.001]  We're absolutely going to have Wisconsin's Independence Day tomorrow because we are sick to death of his lies and his deceit and his working on behalf of corporations.
[01:40:12.681 --> 01:40:14.623]  He could care less about us.
[01:40:15.464 --> 01:40:23.333]  Here in Wisconsin, workers, he could care less about Puerto Ricans, and yet he pushed through the Puerto Rico hedge fund bailout.
[01:40:23.733 --> 01:40:31.742]  He could care less about Wisconsin's pensioners, which way were sold those junk bonds, invested in Puerto Rico.
[01:40:32.657 --> 01:40:36.599]  But his hedge fund integers, oh, he loves them.
[01:40:36.619 --> 01:40:44.543]  He loves them because they put money in his campaign coffers and he has got visions of running in 2020.
[01:40:45.123 --> 01:40:49.185]  That's why he wants to stab Mr. Trump in the back at every opportunity.
[01:40:49.665 --> 01:40:51.086]  He doesn't want to see him succeed.
[01:40:51.106 --> 01:40:55.628]  I've said this before, Paul Ryan should be reporting in-kind contributions
[01:40:56.548 --> 01:40:57.749]  Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[01:40:58.169 --> 01:41:03.112]  Because he's working on her behalf, as opposed to working on behalf of Donald Trump.
[01:41:05.493 --> 01:41:15.779]  Well, I liken your race and others' win, lose, or draw as patriotic duty, and I appreciate your time and energy to do this, because I remember you talking about how when you first started running, how folks have been betrayed by him.
[01:41:16.359 --> 01:41:17.260]  Remember Eric Cantor?
[01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:19.941]  Now, he was way ahead in the polls on election day, he lost.
[01:41:20.502 --> 01:41:25.765]  We've learned these polls, especially in key races, trying to prop folks up, are absolutely staged.
[01:41:27.052 --> 01:41:32.974]  And meanwhile, a little-known economics professor beats him 55 to 44.
[01:41:33.014 --> 01:41:35.155]  That's Dave Brat that we've had on the broadcast.
[01:41:35.175 --> 01:41:35.975]  We should get him back up.
[01:41:36.315 --> 01:41:40.577]  I remember polls back at the time said he was going to be losing about 30 points.
[01:41:41.037 --> 01:41:49.560]  Now they've got ridiculous polls even worse out on you, which shows me how desperate they are, because if you can take down this lead fake rhino, that's bye-bye to the rest of these guys.
[01:41:50.601 --> 01:41:50.841]  Right.
[01:41:51.161 --> 01:41:52.722]  Yeah, we're sending a message here.
[01:41:54.983 --> 01:41:58.285]  I will never stop running against Speaker Ryan.
[01:41:58.445 --> 01:41:59.706]  I am going to take him down.
[01:42:00.226 --> 01:42:01.187]  God is my witness.
[01:42:01.647 --> 01:42:07.711]  I am going to be on him every moment of every day until I have his seat.
[01:42:08.551 --> 01:42:09.372]  I'm not going away.
[01:42:09.392 --> 01:42:20.999]  I'm going to take that seat tomorrow, and if by some miracle he keeps it, and I say miracle because I'm telling you, Alex, we are knocking thousands of doors a day.
[01:42:21.059 --> 01:42:21.559]  We hit almost 10,000.
[01:42:21.719 --> 01:42:22.960]  I was about to say, sir, sir.
[01:42:24.401 --> 01:42:27.784]  We couldn't find anyone in California that was for Hillary.
[01:42:28.464 --> 01:42:30.666]  God bless them, they were all Democrats for Sanders.
[01:42:30.966 --> 01:42:34.889]  And then at the polls, 8 out of 10 people were for Sanders.
[01:42:35.069 --> 01:42:37.391]  So I don't know, she'd have 500 people, he'd have 20,000.
[01:42:37.831 --> 01:42:40.033]  She has 1,000, Trump has 50,000.
[01:42:40.093 --> 01:42:42.495]  I mean, something's going on here with these polls.
[01:42:43.942 --> 01:42:56.028]  I had more people at my campaign rally with Ann Coulter on Saturday than Hillary Clinton is having at her events, to give you some sense of that.
[01:42:56.328 --> 01:43:01.230]  And that's not saying a lot, because she has hardly anybody there, unless they're her staffers.
[01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:09.774]  But Speaker Ryan has betrayed Wisconsin's 1st District, has betrayed Wisconsin, has betrayed this nation.
[01:43:09.994 --> 01:43:10.755]  Well, you live up there.
[01:43:10.815 --> 01:43:11.936]  What type of guy is he?
[01:43:12.036 --> 01:43:14.117]  I mean, we know he does the opposite of what he says.
[01:43:15.639 --> 01:43:17.920]  I mean, why does he, I mean, really?
[01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:20.763]  I mean, there you are with a business, with all these employees, running all this stuff.
[01:43:21.023 --> 01:43:22.404]  It's hard to do in America, but you're doing it.
[01:43:22.764 --> 01:43:25.486]  I do the same thing, because we're not going to, you know, give in to this garbage.
[01:43:25.927 --> 01:43:28.309]  But, I mean, he just, why do they love to do this to our country?
[01:43:30.117 --> 01:43:30.718]  It's the money.
[01:43:30.978 --> 01:43:35.241]  It is the pure, raw chase for money and power.
[01:43:36.062 --> 01:43:37.803]  There's no question.
[01:43:38.143 --> 01:43:42.267]  The vast majority of Paul Ryan's campaign financing comes from inside the D.C.
[01:43:42.287 --> 01:43:42.687]  Beltway.
[01:43:43.287 --> 01:43:51.514]  When you stop and think about how he could be voting on Wisconsin's behalf when most of his money comes from the D.C.
[01:43:51.534 --> 01:43:55.097]  Beltway, when I saw his first FEC reports and saw that,
[01:43:55.737 --> 01:44:01.078]  The vast majority, 83% of his campaign financing came from outside of Wisconsin's 1st District.
[01:44:01.599 --> 01:44:04.179]  The vast majority of which came from inside the D.C.
[01:44:04.199 --> 01:44:04.639]  Beltway.
[01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:12.622]  It just, it sickened me like you can't imagine because here's a guy that I put signs in the ground for.
[01:44:12.702 --> 01:44:15.402]  Here's a guy who I made phone calls on behalf of.
[01:44:15.863 --> 01:44:17.063]  I was a diamond sponsor.
[01:44:18.097 --> 01:44:19.398]  We're good to go.
[01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:42.174]  Yeah, Fortune 500 in charge of Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
[01:44:42.195 --> 01:44:45.298]  I had over $2 billion worth of business report to me.
[01:44:45.758 --> 01:44:46.960]  Do you know where I started out?
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:49.442]  I started out on the factory floor.
[01:44:49.903 --> 01:44:54.327]  I was on the gig degree at night 12 year program.
[01:44:54.668 --> 01:44:55.749]  That's where I started out.
[01:44:56.369 --> 01:44:57.971]  I eventually ran that factory.
[01:44:58.111 --> 01:45:00.234]  I've run factories all over the United States.
[01:45:00.794 --> 01:45:04.475]  I shut down businesses in Mexico and brought those jobs to the United States.
[01:45:04.555 --> 01:45:13.678]  Just last August, I shut down the factory portion of a business we bought in Canada, brought those jobs back to the East Coast, and moved jobs from the East Coast to Beaver Dam, Wisconsin.
[01:45:15.979 --> 01:45:17.419]  And I did it with China.
[01:45:17.459 --> 01:45:22.201]  I brought product lines back to China, put them in Indiana and in Florida.
[01:45:22.961 --> 01:45:26.102]  Every case, every case, I've done it more profitably.
[01:45:28.041 --> 01:45:28.502]  Absolutely.
[01:45:28.562 --> 01:45:37.111]  Globalism is set up to, and again we're not to get China or anybody, it's set up to give the people nothing and consolidate control that Ross Perot talked about, a giant sucking sound.
[01:45:37.371 --> 01:45:45.039]  We should use the West to build up the third world, not transfer the West to the third world, but only selectively and then implode the whole planet.
[01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:49.184]  Why do you think the globalist Paul Nealon, paulnealon.com,
[01:45:50.626 --> 01:45:53.270]  In the big primary tomorrow against Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.
[01:45:53.691 --> 01:45:58.539]  Why do you think they're doing this system when, as you pointed out, long-term globalism is not profitable?
[01:45:59.220 --> 01:45:59.721]  I know why.
[01:45:59.801 --> 01:46:01.624]  It's about consolidation of control.
[01:46:02.671 --> 01:46:09.976]  Working with totalitarian countries and third world nations, you can consolidate control, you can undercut, and you can transfer the power to yourself.
[01:46:10.016 --> 01:46:11.276]  And I think that's really nasty.
[01:46:11.937 --> 01:46:20.342]  I mean, if I was a rich billionaire or whatever, I would want to see lots of businesses and lots of industry like Henry Ford called for, and employees that could buy the cars you're making, and prosperity.
[01:46:20.382 --> 01:46:29.188]  But instead we hear, it's the time of austerity, we need to be poor now, from Obama, speaking from red carpets in front of giant, you know, Air Force One.
[01:46:30.899 --> 01:46:34.822]  These guys have already, these guys have already dissolved borders.
[01:46:34.943 --> 01:46:37.064]  Mentally, they already made the switch.
[01:46:37.685 --> 01:46:43.150]  The rest of us are considered serfs to them.
[01:46:43.170 --> 01:46:45.352]  That's right, they got a plan and we're in the way of it.
[01:46:46.886 --> 01:46:47.647]  That's exactly right.
[01:46:48.347 --> 01:46:56.413]  And you know that as I've been campaigning around this district and I've been getting some more notoriety, these guys are doing everything they can.
[01:46:56.453 --> 01:47:02.677]  The Wisconsin GOP, the party machine, Reince Priebus, and
[01:47:03.698 --> 01:47:16.206]  The entire machine is so clamped down on the levers of power and wanting to stay on those levers of power to keep me from securing America's jobs.
[01:47:16.646 --> 01:47:18.787]  They want open borders so bad.
[01:47:18.867 --> 01:47:22.009]  Paul Ryan couldn't help but say on CNN on his
[01:47:23.050 --> 01:47:25.692]  I was calling it the CNN Never Trump Infomercial.
[01:47:26.273 --> 01:47:34.959]  Paul Ryan was on there talking about how we need to change immigration laws so we can keep a steady stream of low-cost labor coming into this country.
[01:47:35.559 --> 01:47:40.423]  I mean, to have somebody say we need to keep down wages in this country?
[01:47:41.204 --> 01:47:46.508]  The entire time Paul Ryan has been in Congress, the last 18 years, wages have been down.
[01:47:47.108 --> 01:47:49.049]  You go to the grocery store, things cost more.
[01:47:49.610 --> 01:47:53.092]  We've actually, we're actually losing ground in the middle class.
[01:47:53.692 --> 01:47:58.735]  Forget about, forget about inner city or, or anywhere.
[01:47:59.135 --> 01:48:01.597]  People just getting onto the, just getting onto the ladder.
[01:48:02.617 --> 01:48:11.603]  African Americans, recent legal immigrants, recent legal immigrants in my district, to me, we, we worked hard to come here.
[01:48:11.803 --> 01:48:13.144]  We love this country.
[01:48:13.724 --> 01:48:16.726]  We, we say the Pledge of Allegiance, we, we salute the
[01:48:17.127 --> 01:48:26.728]  And we will be damned if we want Speaker Ryan to let everybody in here in front of us.
[01:48:27.651 --> 01:48:29.812]  We have a legal immigration system.
[01:48:29.852 --> 01:48:35.414]  Absolutely, and again, I can't go to China or Mexico and show up and have my baby for free and then the baby's a citizen.
[01:48:35.914 --> 01:48:37.955]  They sell it as this loving thing.
[01:48:38.195 --> 01:48:40.296]  They're using the immigrants to drive down the wages.
[01:48:40.496 --> 01:48:43.117]  They're using them as a new political group they can control.
[01:48:44.038 --> 01:48:46.379]  Again, none of these countries would let us do this there.
[01:48:47.519 --> 01:48:49.840]  They've used America's openness, the globalists have.
[01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:53.201]  And look, I think you and many others
[01:48:55.230 --> 01:48:55.450]  I think so.
[01:49:18.507 --> 01:49:23.630]  It is that spirit, that awakening to the tyranny, that you can't put the genie back in the bottle, in my view.
[01:49:23.751 --> 01:49:26.092]  I don't see how the globalists are going to get their program through.
[01:49:27.153 --> 01:49:27.933]  Look at the Brexit.
[01:49:28.334 --> 01:49:29.234]  I think the tide's turning.
[01:49:30.895 --> 01:49:31.476]  Absolutely.
[01:49:31.516 --> 01:49:32.777]  I've got friends over in London.
[01:49:33.217 --> 01:49:40.182]  When I was running those other regions, I had a flat in London that I only saw on the weekends.
[01:49:40.222 --> 01:49:46.426]  Man, I would love landing in Heathrow or Gatwick and talking to the cabbies.
[01:49:47.046 --> 01:49:49.867]  Man, did they, I used to love running them up.
[01:49:50.167 --> 01:49:52.828]  And thank God, you guys stayed on the pound.
[01:49:53.308 --> 01:49:56.029]  And thank God Poland stayed on the zloty.
[01:49:56.429 --> 01:49:58.670]  And thank God Denmark stayed on the kroner.
[01:49:59.030 --> 01:50:01.811]  Because otherwise, they've got you by the short hairs.
[01:50:02.011 --> 01:50:03.612]  They absolutely have you.
[01:50:03.632 --> 01:50:06.913]  The EU, let me throw a couple numbers at you.
[01:50:08.094 --> 01:50:13.896]  There are 5.5 billion people with the B, that make less
[01:50:15.256 --> 01:50:15.776]  I don't know.
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:43.583]  When you think about what Paul Ryan is capable of doing and what he's done... Look, he's a monster, but just like Ted Bundy, he's a handsome guy, so you don't understand you're getting in a yellow Volkswagen.
[01:50:44.083 --> 01:50:46.824]  Paul Nealon, paulnealon.com, I hope you win tomorrow.
[01:50:47.064 --> 01:50:51.886]  Regardless, you've won by taking action, engaging the public, injecting real issues.
[01:50:52.186 --> 01:50:54.107]  Folks can contribute, paulnealon.com.
[01:50:54.347 --> 01:50:56.027]  You got family in Wisconsin, you're up there.
[01:50:56.327 --> 01:50:58.188]  Get out and vote for this guy in the Republican primary.
[01:50:58.408 --> 01:51:02.109]  Look forward to speaking to you in the future, my friend, and hopefully when you're a congressman.
[01:51:04.215 --> 01:51:04.836]  Thank you, Paul.
[01:51:05.116 --> 01:51:08.539]  All right, we'll be back, ladies and gentlemen, with more news and more guests.
[01:51:08.559 --> 01:51:09.721]  Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:51:11.162 --> 01:51:16.688]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[01:51:17.168 --> 01:51:25.076]  Unveiled, Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula, 30 servings, fruit punch flavor dietary supplement.
[01:51:25.397 --> 01:51:26.438]  It is simply amazing.
[01:51:26.518 --> 01:51:27.439]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:51:27.839 --> 01:51:32.244]  There's a million different products like this out there that they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[01:51:32.764 --> 01:51:45.859]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all the essential amino acids, all the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[01:51:46.219 --> 01:51:47.440]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:48.662]  I put it in my protein shake.
[01:51:49.262 --> 01:51:54.767]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[01:51:54.787 --> 01:51:57.810]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[01:51:57.850 --> 01:52:00.092]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[01:52:00.693 --> 01:52:06.838]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[01:52:07.059 --> 01:52:09.981]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here, okay?
[01:52:10.021 --> 01:52:11.683]  Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[01:52:11.943 --> 01:52:15.027]  There's some great stuff out there.
[01:52:15.167 --> 01:52:18.972]  And there's other powders I promote at Infowarshealth.com that are excellent.
[01:52:19.553 --> 01:52:20.555]  There's some good stuff out there.
[01:52:20.715 --> 01:52:23.398]  This is just the very best we can bring you.
[01:52:23.418 --> 01:52:25.461]  And when you buy it, you support Infowars.
[01:52:25.722 --> 01:52:26.763]  You support the reporters.
[01:52:27.003 --> 01:52:27.764]  You support yourself.
[01:52:28.973 --> 01:52:37.077]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total complete package for your body.
[01:52:37.117 --> 01:52:48.542]  Because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[01:52:49.062 --> 01:52:49.683]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:52:49.703 --> 01:52:52.865]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[01:52:52.965 --> 01:52:54.206]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[01:52:54.226 --> 01:52:55.047]  Tell folks about that.
[01:52:55.067 --> 01:52:57.709]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[01:52:57.729 --> 01:53:01.231]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[01:53:01.792 --> 01:53:08.156]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine, each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[01:53:08.577 --> 01:53:11.779]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[01:53:11.799 --> 01:53:13.340]  34 other ones you can check out.
[01:53:13.540 --> 01:53:15.362]  Go to imporouslife.com, the label's up there.
[01:53:15.882 --> 01:53:18.184]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[01:53:18.584 --> 01:53:25.989]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just... By the way, look on the other side too, because we're showing people the minerals and things.
[01:53:26.029 --> 01:53:27.890]  Let's look at the vitamins right there, Old Scott, in there.
[01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:28.571]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:53:28.611 --> 01:53:29.091]  Top left.
[01:53:29.131 --> 01:53:32.493]  Again, if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:53:32.854 --> 01:53:35.916]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's the other source?
[01:53:36.596 --> 01:53:39.338]  I just show this to all the best sources.
[01:53:41.044 --> 01:53:41.464]  Retinol.
[01:53:41.484 --> 01:53:45.946]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[01:53:46.286 --> 01:53:46.686]  And you know what?
[01:53:46.766 --> 01:53:48.927]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[01:53:49.147 --> 01:53:49.747]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[01:53:49.768 --> 01:53:56.790]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[01:53:57.110 --> 01:54:02.653]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[01:54:03.153 --> 01:54:03.993]  So get them today.
[01:54:04.073 --> 01:54:06.114]  Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:54:15.530 --> 01:54:20.752]  America's power was leveraged to set up a worldwide corporate empire.
[01:54:21.633 --> 01:54:38.159]  If you go back to the 1780s and 90s, there were major British newspaper articles saying the American system of lower taxes and less regulation, and not only letting lords have licenses to have factories and businesses, is shutting down our system worldwide.
[01:54:38.199 --> 01:54:39.440]  We won't be able to compete with it.
[01:54:40.256 --> 01:54:45.878]  And they estimated within 50 years the United States would begin to outstrip the British Empire, which it began to do.
[01:54:47.158 --> 01:54:58.823]  Then the Germans got free market, the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, and there were articles all over the British press before World War I, you know, saying, oh my gosh, we've got the German problem.
[01:54:59.243 --> 01:55:00.823]  It's worse than the American problem.
[01:55:01.604 --> 01:55:08.286]  So they went over and shot the Archduke and started a civil war, funded street riots, and the Germans bellied up to the bar and had a big war.
[01:55:10.143 --> 01:55:25.275]  So, I'm not blaming the British themselves, but the British Empire model of control is what Zbigniew Brzezinski and Carol Quigley and Cecil Rhodes and all the rest of these people say we're under.
[01:55:25.335 --> 01:55:27.817]  I mean, Henry Kissinger writes books, you can go read them.
[01:55:28.878 --> 01:55:31.900]  People keep saying, man, Alex knew about this stuff 20 years ago and it's all come true.
[01:55:34.242 --> 01:55:35.182]  Are you a secret agent?
[01:55:37.924 --> 01:55:39.466]  I read their books.
[01:55:40.854 --> 01:55:42.235]  We're living in their world.
[01:55:42.295 --> 01:55:44.635]  And let me tell you, where it goes next isn't pretty.
[01:55:47.036 --> 01:55:49.037]  We have that State Department clip.
[01:55:51.598 --> 01:55:53.419]  Because the chair's halfway broken here.
[01:55:54.539 --> 01:55:58.981]  Because that's really important where the spokesman for the... I'm going to play the full clip.
[01:56:00.061 --> 01:56:00.581]  Last week.
[01:56:01.022 --> 01:56:03.282]  He's just making jokes because there's a group of interns here.
[01:56:03.302 --> 01:56:08.444]  And he goes, we're going to teach the interns about how to be transparent and how to be good and democracy.
[01:56:08.464 --> 01:56:09.685]  And they all laugh and cackle.
[01:56:10.646 --> 01:56:18.969]  Because they're really inducting him into corruption like Gruber when he gets up on C-SPAN and says, I'm the best liar, that's why the president hired me to screw folks on Obamacare.
[01:56:20.050 --> 01:56:22.571]  So it's just really a cynical, sick culture.
[01:56:22.791 --> 01:56:23.371]  Here's that clip.
[01:56:24.031 --> 01:56:24.851]  Welcome to the State Department.
[01:56:24.871 --> 01:56:26.272]  I think we have some interns in the back.
[01:56:26.312 --> 01:56:26.652]  Welcome.
[01:56:29.013 --> 01:56:34.075]  Good to see you in this exercise in transparency and democracy.
[01:56:37.771 --> 01:56:40.373]  Is that what it is?
[01:56:40.433 --> 01:56:41.254]  He's reveling.
[01:56:41.474 --> 01:56:50.462]  I thought it was an exercise in spinning obfuscation.
[01:56:50.602 --> 01:57:02.913]  And again, they just institutionalize it like it's funny.
[01:57:03.113 --> 01:57:04.274]  It's really, really painful.
[01:57:07.469 --> 01:57:11.171]  It's really, really painful to see that we've gotten to this level in this culture, in this society.
[01:57:12.812 --> 01:57:14.853]  But the good news is, the culture is changing.
[01:57:14.973 --> 01:57:17.235]  We still have a little bit of a free economic system left.
[01:57:17.795 --> 01:57:20.917]  That's why they want to extinguish it, because that can leverage out their whole program.
[01:57:21.958 --> 01:57:32.624]  And Americana, and owning firearms, and rock climbing, and getting into extreme sports, all of this is pro-human activity, getting us out of the nanny state.
[01:57:32.844 --> 01:57:34.585]  The human spirit is struggling against it.
[01:57:35.025 --> 01:57:35.846]  And it's going to be
[01:57:39.065 --> 01:57:48.877]  Those type of activities that end up overall transcending what the new world order is trying to do, and they'll just be a bunch of mentally ill people gibbering in a corner, laughing and talking about the good old days when they ran things.
[01:57:50.739 --> 01:57:56.526]  And when things flip back to honor, you do one thing dishonorable, one thing weasel-y, you're gonna have to pay for it.
[01:57:57.602 --> 01:58:03.206]  It's just a bunch of dishonorable people going, ah, we have the high ground, throwing crap at us all day, trying to demoralize us.
[01:58:03.806 --> 01:58:11.992]  Here's an article, NRA reports, yet another record-setting month for firearm purchases, over 16 million FBI background checks in the first seven months of 2016.
[01:58:12.172 --> 01:58:16.635]  That's 16 million more people buying guns.
[01:58:18.497 --> 01:58:21.919]  And it just keeps happening month after month after month after month after month after
[01:58:27.717 --> 01:58:31.119]  And despite the imploding economy, it's going to help, hopefully, keep the crime rate down.
[01:58:32.119 --> 01:58:35.841]  Speaking of funding the economy, we're going to end the free shipping today.
[01:58:35.861 --> 01:58:38.223]  It will be over, on all items at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:58:38.863 --> 01:58:42.765]  And BrainForce, the nootropics, about to end 40% off on that, and a lot more.
[01:58:43.666 --> 01:58:48.108]  And we have also DNAForce, but we've added 40% off on AnthroPlex.
[01:58:48.728 --> 01:58:50.249]  It's amazing, you really should try it.
[01:58:50.609 --> 01:58:51.070]  We'll be back.
[01:58:51.210 --> 01:58:53.031]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:58:53.631 --> 01:58:57.033]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:59:00.742 --> 01:59:03.865]  Hillary Clinton's homebrew email server, which was used to send classified U.S.
[01:59:03.885 --> 01:59:12.332]  government information, may have led directly to the death of a scientist in Iran who provided intelligence to the U.S., as reported by Steve Watson of InfoWars.com.
[01:59:12.452 --> 01:59:18.577]  Last week, the Iranian government executed the scientist after charging him with treason for providing, quote, vital information to the enemy.
[01:59:18.718 --> 01:59:23.762]  The Iranians were apparently tipped off about the scientist's ties to the CIA thanks to Hillary's unsecure server.
[01:59:23.962 --> 01:59:33.067]  After the former Secretary of State discussed his situation in plain text email, and in response to the controversy, Senator Tom Cotton said Hillary's recklessness could have easily caused a death to the scientists.
[01:59:33.207 --> 01:59:40.892]  He said, quote, that goes to show just how reckless and careless her decision was to put that kind of highly classified information on a private server.
[01:59:41.032 --> 01:59:42.533]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:17.794 --> 02:00:18.455]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:00:18.575 --> 02:00:21.038]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:48.504 --> 02:00:49.505]  Thank you, everybody.
[02:00:53.227 --> 02:00:58.551]  This is what happens when you go from 35 people to close to 2,000 people, I guess.
[02:00:59.912 --> 02:01:11.560]  In the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies, and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website.
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:17.144]  Our opposition, on the other hand, has long ago run out of ideas.
[02:01:18.084 --> 02:01:21.205]  All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same.
[02:01:21.285 --> 02:01:30.368]  More taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and on American production.
[02:01:30.868 --> 02:01:32.089]  More of that.
[02:01:33.489 --> 02:01:41.892]  If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda.
[02:01:42.768 --> 02:01:43.628]  God bless that man.
[02:01:43.768 --> 02:01:44.648]  Total Veritas.
[02:01:44.928 --> 02:01:46.929]  Donald J. Trump, just hours ago, Detroit.
[02:01:48.329 --> 02:01:49.089]  Rotting skeleton.
[02:01:49.109 --> 02:01:59.771]  It would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs right out of existence.
[02:01:59.851 --> 02:02:01.451]  And electricity to cost three times as much.
[02:02:01.471 --> 02:02:09.973]  One common feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States.
[02:02:15.186 --> 02:02:21.548]  Every policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expense.
[02:02:21.948 --> 02:02:32.951]  And that's why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us, divide us, and pull us apart.
[02:02:34.304 --> 02:02:44.670]  My campaign is about reaching out to everyone as Americans and returning to a government that puts the American people first.
[02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:09.940]  Thank you.
[02:03:13.542 --> 02:03:17.324]  Here is what an America First economic plan looks like.
[02:03:18.025 --> 02:03:20.186]  First, let's talk tax reform.
[02:03:21.066 --> 02:03:24.928]  Taxes are one of the biggest differences in this race.
[02:03:25.449 --> 02:03:35.014]  Hillary Clinton, who has spent her career voting for tax increases, plans another massive job-killing $1.3 trillion tax increase.
[02:03:38.081 --> 02:03:40.562]  Big increase, one of the biggest ever.
[02:03:41.442 --> 02:03:44.824]  Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost 50%.
[02:03:46.784 --> 02:03:52.887]  Recently, at a campaign event, Hillary Clinton short-circuited, you know this, you've heard this one.
[02:03:53.687 --> 02:04:05.852]  Hillary Clinton short-circuited again, to use a now famous term, when she accidentally told the truth and said that she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class.
[02:04:13.203 --> 02:04:18.849]  I am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans.
[02:04:19.409 --> 02:04:23.733]  This will lead to millions of new and really good-paying jobs.
[02:04:24.634 --> 02:04:33.062]  The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs or undermines- That's right.
[02:04:34.232 --> 02:04:37.454]  Hillary spends this, that he wants to cut the corporate tax in half.
[02:04:38.394 --> 02:04:45.639]  We have the highest corporate tax in the world, and the big corporations lobby for that, knowing other corporations won't be sophisticated enough, small and medium.
[02:04:45.659 --> 02:04:48.440]  They've got special law firms, even have the IRS not come after you.
[02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:49.221]  It's all selective.
[02:04:49.741 --> 02:04:50.882]  And then you move offshore.
[02:04:51.322 --> 02:04:52.883]  It's designed to facilitate that.
[02:04:53.183 --> 02:04:59.066]  Then the big megacorporations control China and others, and then they bring you into the nation themselves and get a cut.
[02:04:59.687 --> 02:05:01.568]  The globalists want to work with authoritarians.
[02:05:02.248 --> 02:05:09.346]  That's why they've shut America off and sold our industry off as a way to take over the planet and leverage it back to further shut us down.
[02:05:10.194 --> 02:05:19.223]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:05:19.283 --> 02:05:27.510]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:05:27.691 --> 02:05:32.375]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:05:32.555 --> 02:05:39.277]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:39.337 --> 02:05:46.419]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:05:46.519 --> 02:05:53.401]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:05:53.541 --> 02:05:57.882]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:05:58.022 --> 02:06:01.243]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:06:01.403 --> 02:06:07.549]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:06:07.709 --> 02:06:09.911]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:09.991 --> 02:06:19.079]  If you can't see the irony in having a gun ban enforced by men with guns, well then you fail to understand why the Second Amendment was written in the first place.
[02:06:19.119 --> 02:06:21.942]  Throughout history, only slaves are disarmed.
[02:06:22.062 --> 02:06:25.843]  A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
[02:06:25.943 --> 02:06:27.063]  The right of the people.
[02:06:27.163 --> 02:06:28.283]  The right of the people.
[02:06:28.363 --> 02:06:29.263]  The right of the people.
[02:06:29.343 --> 02:06:31.784]  To keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[02:06:31.844 --> 02:06:40.745]  For all of you actors out there who go to your red carpet events, surrounded by full battle rattle SWAT teams, while you accept your awards for your latest violent movie.
[02:06:41.065 --> 02:06:49.947]  For all you politicians who spend your nine to five days scheming up ways to take away my Second Amendment rights, meanwhile you have first responders on site there to protect you,
[02:06:50.327 --> 02:06:50.948]  I say this.
[02:06:51.268 --> 02:06:52.369]  Come and take it.
[02:06:52.529 --> 02:06:55.052]  I have a strict gun control policy.
[02:06:55.492 --> 02:06:58.115]  If there's a gun around, I want to control it.
[02:06:58.736 --> 02:06:59.436]  Clint Eastwood.
[02:06:59.636 --> 02:07:00.197]  Go ahead.
[02:07:01.218 --> 02:07:02.119]  Make my day.
[02:07:02.299 --> 02:07:07.564]  Dads demand guns because it's me that's got to get up and go check out that noise at 2am.
[02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:11.062]  BrainForce is here.
[02:07:11.583 --> 02:07:13.866]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:07:14.147 --> 02:07:21.959]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:07:22.731 --> 02:07:25.873]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[02:07:26.174 --> 02:07:26.314]  Right?
[02:07:26.334 --> 02:07:28.676]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:07:29.036 --> 02:07:32.539]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:07:32.599 --> 02:07:35.741]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:07:36.241 --> 02:07:41.045]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:07:41.586 --> 02:07:43.387]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[02:07:43.747 --> 02:07:48.171]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:07:48.351 --> 02:07:50.352]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:07:50.973 --> 02:07:52.434]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:07:52.594 --> 02:07:52.834]  Exactly.
[02:07:52.854 --> 02:07:56.635]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:07:57.155 --> 02:08:04.416]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com.
[02:08:04.676 --> 02:08:07.237]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[02:08:07.597 --> 02:08:15.878]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:16.238 --> 02:08:16.898]  Watch me!
[02:08:18.099 --> 02:08:18.779]  Watch me!
[02:08:20.119 --> 02:08:20.599]  I got it!
[02:08:23.921 --> 02:08:29.285]  I got something that makes me want to shout.
[02:08:30.346 --> 02:08:33.308]  I got something that tells me what it's all about.
[02:08:33.689 --> 02:08:37.692]  I got a soul and I'm super bad.
[02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:53.603]  It was the 1968 election, the last time we saw somebody like Donald Trump.
[02:08:54.183 --> 02:08:57.044]  Reagan's close, but a lot slicker.
[02:09:08.457 --> 02:09:10.960]  But they knew he was an anti-Federal Reserve guy.
[02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:12.902]  They knew he was anti-New World Order.
[02:09:13.622 --> 02:09:17.687]  He called George Herbert Walker Bush a Rockefeller Republican who wanted a world government.
[02:09:18.667 --> 02:09:22.852]  He said he's part of that trilateral commission that wants to hand over our power to a worldwide government.
[02:09:24.914 --> 02:09:27.997]  We actually have the clips of Ronald Reagan speeches in 1979 and 80 saying, and I've played them,
[02:09:29.838 --> 02:09:32.920]  We ought to find those, because I know they hit the cutting room floor.
[02:09:32.940 --> 02:09:40.904]  I mean, they're in the film, but we've got the actual tapes that we sent off to the news services and got, I think one of them was from CBS from 1979.
[02:09:40.944 --> 02:09:42.265]  Hardly anybody's seen this stuff.
[02:09:43.185 --> 02:09:50.129]  And it's Ronald Reagan there on the podium talking about the New World Order and world government and how it's got to be stopped, how they're going to set up multinational trade deals.
[02:09:50.549 --> 02:09:54.191]  He was reading John Birch Society literature at the time.
[02:09:55.794 --> 02:10:01.538]  And boy, they shot him within a year of being in office to shut him up and let him know who the real bosses were.
[02:10:02.038 --> 02:10:06.561]  But if you go back to Barry Goldwater, you should read his book with no apologies, Senator Barry Goldwater.
[02:10:06.581 --> 02:10:10.704]  I mean, you'd think the establishment would want a guy like that.
[02:10:11.004 --> 02:10:16.747]  Very prominent family, patriot, owned shopping malls across the country.
[02:10:17.228 --> 02:10:18.889]  One of the first families to build shopping malls.
[02:10:20.678 --> 02:10:24.880]  And he was led into the Trilateral Commission Info, was like, I'm not going to sell America out and do all this.
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:32.363]  And boy, they came out and they said Barry Goldwater wants a nuclear war with the Russians, even though he was for detente.
[02:10:33.404 --> 02:10:35.385]  Just like, heard of that before?
[02:10:35.445 --> 02:10:36.686]  Just like Donald Trump.
[02:10:37.206 --> 02:10:39.687]  Donald Trump wants detente, detente.
[02:10:41.208 --> 02:10:43.189]  We've got to queue up that minute and a half clip of the
[02:10:44.505 --> 02:10:49.729]  Princeton professor on CNN who's like a liberal and not even a Trump supporter.
[02:10:49.749 --> 02:10:51.811]  He's like, this is all complete lies.
[02:10:51.831 --> 02:10:55.333]  Trump wants to taunt and you guys are acting like Neo McCarthyites.
[02:10:55.874 --> 02:10:57.095]  So now I am a Trump supporter.
[02:10:58.315 --> 02:11:04.900]  But they're running these ads now and saying Trump asked folks if we could use nuclear weapons and it turned out he never said it.
[02:11:05.661 --> 02:11:08.023]  It's Hillary running around starting all the wars.
[02:11:08.103 --> 02:11:12.146]  It's the globalists moving troops up against the border with Russia and moving nuclear missiles in.
[02:11:13.951 --> 02:11:14.951]  And the Russians have said that.
[02:11:16.152 --> 02:11:17.412]  They say they welcome detente.
[02:11:17.633 --> 02:11:19.353]  They don't want to spend their money on military equipment.
[02:11:20.454 --> 02:11:23.835]  They don't want to have a new Cold War that's designed to bankrupt all these other countries.
[02:11:24.015 --> 02:11:25.136]  The Russians aren't stupid.
[02:11:26.756 --> 02:11:29.598]  They want to build civilization, infrastructure.
[02:11:30.478 --> 02:11:32.739]  They want to sell aircraft and cars and computers.
[02:11:33.759 --> 02:11:39.882]  They've been shut out of the game for 80-something years, and they want in the game, and they can compete in the game.
[02:11:41.598 --> 02:11:42.659]  And Trump understands that.
[02:11:43.379 --> 02:11:44.360]  Trump is a builder.
[02:11:44.901 --> 02:11:52.086]  We're gonna go to our guest here in a moment, but I wanted to play for the 1968 famous ad that they say made Barry Goldwater lose the election.
[02:11:52.326 --> 02:12:00.993]  He was ahead to LBJ, but notice LBJ's illnesses basically caused him to have to just get out later anyways.
[02:12:02.154 --> 02:12:04.535]  So that's the amazing thing is we have Hillary Clinton
[02:12:05.746 --> 02:12:06.867]  Staggering around.
[02:12:07.867 --> 02:12:08.967]  Toddling around.
[02:12:09.207 --> 02:12:10.168]  Falling down.
[02:12:10.708 --> 02:12:12.269]  Having brain surgery.
[02:12:12.769 --> 02:12:14.210]  Looking completely insane.
[02:12:15.370 --> 02:12:16.811]  Obviously having seizures.
[02:12:19.312 --> 02:12:23.213]  I mean, my uncle was in a motorcycle accident and his brain had to be put back in his head.
[02:12:23.233 --> 02:12:25.834]  He had to learn how to talk and everything again.
[02:12:25.854 --> 02:12:26.875]  He was 17.
[02:12:28.655 --> 02:12:29.276]  My dad's brother.
[02:12:29.876 --> 02:12:31.216]  And I've been with him many times.
[02:12:33.576 --> 02:12:36.257]  I lived there quite a few summers and was sent down there for a year.
[02:12:36.277 --> 02:12:37.377]  I was in high school five years.
[02:12:37.417 --> 02:12:38.257]  I was in trouble one year.
[02:12:38.918 --> 02:12:41.458]  When I was 16, I was sent down there and he worked on the ranch.
[02:12:42.679 --> 02:12:57.923]  I worked for a large animal vet, but I would sometimes ride along with him in the morning checking fences and sometimes he'd go, he'd go, oh, no, and he'd go, oh, and he'd start doing just like, can we cue that video up of Hillary when she's, oh, oh, that's exactly what he would do.
[02:12:59.008 --> 02:13:04.773]  Sometimes, I only saw this once, he would have the full-on thing where he got to stick a spoon in his mouth, a wooden spoon, where he'd bite his tongue off.
[02:13:05.874 --> 02:13:10.098]  And boy, he'd be out of bed for days after he'd had one of those full-on grand mal seizures.
[02:13:10.518 --> 02:13:12.500]  But she's having seizures.
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:13.981]  In public.
[02:13:15.834 --> 02:13:18.776]  And then she's been trained to act like it's fun and no big deal.
[02:13:19.377 --> 02:13:21.018]  And everybody's like asking, are you okay?
[02:13:21.038 --> 02:13:27.784]  She's got lesions on her tongue, and she's clearly got signs of Parkinson's, and Bill Clinton has signs of Parkinson's.
[02:13:27.824 --> 02:13:29.645]  I don't know what drugs they've been on or what they're doing.
[02:13:30.006 --> 02:13:37.792]  The point is, is they're trying to say Donald Trump's unfit, or he wants nuclear wars, when everything they accuse him of is what they're doing.
[02:13:38.052 --> 02:13:38.973]  Here is the 1960s TV ad.
[02:13:39.834 --> 02:13:39.994]  One, two,
[02:14:03.801 --> 02:14:16.584]  9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.
[02:14:14.984 --> 02:14:16.584]  These are the stakes.
[02:14:17.884 --> 02:14:23.826]  To make a world in which all of God's children can live, or to go into the dark.
[02:14:25.146 --> 02:14:30.227]  We must either love each other, or we must die.
[02:14:30.965 --> 02:14:33.495]  Vote for President Johnson on November 3rd.
[02:14:34.218 --> 02:14:36.266]  The stakes are too high for you to stay home.
[02:14:38.669 --> 02:14:44.412]  We should make an ad showing all the murder and killing and Hillary funding ISIS and all the rest of it and say the stakes are too high over President Trump.
[02:14:45.113 --> 02:14:47.994]  President Johnson started the Vietnam War.
[02:14:48.375 --> 02:14:52.177]  President Johnson had all these plans to nuke the Soviet Union and Goldwater didn't.
[02:14:52.897 --> 02:14:55.419]  Just like Trump doesn't, but they inverted.
[02:14:55.459 --> 02:15:05.845]  Here's Hayden, then we're going to our guest Michael Snyder of the Economic Collapse blog, prolific writer, researcher, and he will be breaking all this down with the balance of the hour with us, but I wanted to show you Hayden
[02:15:06.505 --> 02:15:13.791]  This is the weird, effeminate, little creep boy that runs around in these military uniforms, the NSA spying on us, spying on our wee-wees.
[02:15:14.771 --> 02:15:17.874]  And that's come out that the NSA spy on their husbands and wives.
[02:15:18.474 --> 02:15:23.017]  And also headed up the CIA, saying that Trump wants to nuke everyone.
[02:15:23.057 --> 02:15:23.418]  Here it is.
[02:15:24.418 --> 02:15:27.541]  What concerns you most about Donald Trump?
[02:15:29.846 --> 02:15:31.468]  How erratic he is.
[02:15:32.028 --> 02:15:35.391]  Joe, I can argue about this position or that position.
[02:15:35.451 --> 02:15:36.912]  I do that with the current president.
[02:15:37.653 --> 02:15:39.834]  But he's inconsistent.
[02:15:40.315 --> 02:15:49.882]  And when you're the head of a global superpower, inconsistency, unpredictability, those are dangerous things.
[02:15:50.383 --> 02:15:53.445]  They frighten your friends and they tempt your enemies.
[02:15:53.945 --> 02:15:56.708]  And so I would be very, very concerned.
[02:15:57.408 --> 02:15:59.291]  Harold Hayden, Harold Ford, very, very quickly.
[02:15:59.611 --> 02:16:07.381]  Who amongst your peers that you respect greatly, whether they think like you or not think like you, that you know that's advising Mr. Trump?
[02:16:08.021 --> 02:16:08.342]  No one.
[02:16:09.944 --> 02:16:11.946]  That's a good answer.
[02:16:13.268 --> 02:16:13.708]  That's enough.
[02:16:14.702 --> 02:16:28.576]  I, um, I was found with a dead end term in my office, uh, then I sold out the system, uh, you know, the girl's dead, strangled, uh, she was hot, good looking, uh, I got Brzezinski's daughter right here, the main architect of the New World Order's daughter, oh baby, oh yeah.
[02:16:28.596 --> 02:16:35.623]  Uh, by the way, I got my numbers flipped, LBJ bowed out in 68, of course the Goldwater election was, uh, or unelection was in 64.
[02:16:35.663 --> 02:16:35.843]  Alright!
[02:16:38.804 --> 02:16:43.187]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, let's go to our guest, Michael Schneider.
[02:16:43.227 --> 02:16:45.468]  There's so much to cover with you, my friend.
[02:16:45.488 --> 02:16:47.769]  What are some of the big topics you want to get into?
[02:16:48.970 --> 02:16:58.836]  Well, we can certainly talk about the economy, how the Wall Street Journal has just come out and said this is the weakest economic recovery since 1949, basically World War II.
[02:16:59.376 --> 02:17:01.798]  And so we can get into all the latest economic numbers.
[02:17:01.838 --> 02:17:03.919]  We can also talk about more about Trump.
[02:17:04.199 --> 02:17:10.383]  And about how the establishment is pulling out all the stops to try to derail him, stop him.
[02:17:10.443 --> 02:17:19.448]  In fact, just before I came on the show today, I went over to CNN, and on CNN today they have a headline, one of their top headlines that says, Trump makes me cringe.
[02:17:19.648 --> 02:17:33.081]  In fact, if you go to just about any mainstream news website on any particular day, you're going to find a negative story about Donald Trump right at the top, usually very, very closely associated with a positive story about Hillary Clinton.
[02:17:33.141 --> 02:17:35.423]  It's a full-on propaganda onslaught.
[02:17:35.763 --> 02:17:41.228]  They're doing everything they can try to do to stop Trump's momentum, to keep him out of the White House.
[02:17:41.728 --> 02:17:43.470]  And so the media is one way they're doing it.
[02:17:43.510 --> 02:17:45.372]  We can talk about some of the other ways, but I...
[02:17:46.673 --> 02:17:48.055]  Yeah, let's get into that right after the break.
[02:17:48.095 --> 02:17:49.938]  The economy, the Trump situation, more.
[02:17:49.958 --> 02:17:52.021]  But why so much hysteria?
[02:17:52.381 --> 02:17:53.983]  I mean, this guy must be really good.
[02:17:54.885 --> 02:17:59.511]  Because from people I know that have known him for 40 years, they say he's been a closeted, anti-New World Order patriot.
[02:17:59.932 --> 02:18:03.477]  And we see a lot of evidence of that previously fighting NAFTA and GATT, and that's why they're so scared.
[02:18:04.878 --> 02:18:07.180]  Yeah, basically he's not a globalist.
[02:18:07.220 --> 02:18:08.561]  He's not a part of the club.
[02:18:08.601 --> 02:18:10.043]  He's not a part of the elite.
[02:18:10.223 --> 02:18:12.785]  And so the elite are used to being in control.
[02:18:13.366 --> 02:18:14.887]  They're used to running the program.
[02:18:14.907 --> 02:18:17.209]  They're used to having the candidates on both sides.
[02:18:22.099 --> 02:18:28.522]  Yeah, so the elite, they don't know what to do because they had hoped to stop him before Trump ever got the nomination.
[02:18:28.562 --> 02:18:34.926]  But by some miracle, because of this uprising of the American people, Trump won the nomination against all odds.
[02:18:35.506 --> 02:18:44.711]  But now the elite are absolutely determined to throw their weight behind Hillary Clinton, give Hillary Clinton more money than any candidate has ever been given before.
[02:18:45.011 --> 02:18:56.781]  They're going to do all that they can, but if they have to go beyond that to more extreme means, I believe that they're not going to hesitate in the least to do whatever it takes to keep Donald Trump out of the White House.
[02:18:57.662 --> 02:19:01.786]  I've never seen the Republican and Democratic establishment working this closely, this openly.
[02:19:02.247 --> 02:19:10.275]  All the powerful multinationals dumping money in, and weird leftists giggling and smirking, saying, we the bosses, we the bosses.
[02:19:10.755 --> 02:19:12.157]  I mean, talk about pathetic.
[02:19:12.197 --> 02:19:13.558]  They claim they're anti-establishment.
[02:19:13.999 --> 02:19:16.822]  Anyone that's anti-establishment has to be for Trump.
[02:19:18.137 --> 02:19:20.798]  Yeah, just look at the Republican establishment, what they're doing.
[02:19:20.878 --> 02:19:34.743]  Sally Fletcher, who is Jeb Bush's top aide, she just came out to CNN in a key interview and she said, hey, I'm not only not voting for Donald Trump, but I'm leaving the Republican Party altogether because of Trump.
[02:19:35.223 --> 02:19:37.984]  And you know, and Sally Fletcher, she's been working with the Bushes since 1988.
[02:19:38.124 --> 02:19:40.905]  I've always been operative.
[02:19:40.945 --> 02:19:42.445]  It's a vacation with the Clintons.
[02:19:42.485 --> 02:19:44.466]  It's all a big narcotics trafficking mess.
[02:19:46.081 --> 02:19:46.421]  It is.
[02:19:46.561 --> 02:19:49.902]  And so not only Sally Fletcher, but you look at Hank Paulson, Henry Paulson.
[02:19:50.022 --> 02:19:52.864]  People remember him from the 2008 financial crisis.
[02:19:53.144 --> 02:19:54.384]  He was Treasury Secretary.
[02:19:54.724 --> 02:19:55.465]  Well, he came out.
[02:19:55.505 --> 02:20:03.087]  Not only did he announce that he's not voting for Trump, but he announced it with a big article in the Washington Post saying, hey, I'm not voting for Trump.
[02:20:03.367 --> 02:20:06.509]  Many of my other establishment Republican friends are not voting for him.
[02:20:06.589 --> 02:20:06.969]  Absolutely.
[02:20:07.009 --> 02:20:08.909]  They're uncloaking themselves as the Democrats.
[02:20:08.929 --> 02:20:09.650]  They always were.
[02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:10.090]  Stay there.
[02:20:20.165 --> 02:20:21.586]  Hillary Clinton is desperate.
[02:20:22.527 --> 02:20:30.473]  Donald Trump was 10 points ahead in the polls until Reuters and others began sampling 10 to 15 percent more Democrats in their polls to skew the numbers.
[02:20:30.773 --> 02:20:31.334]  It's incredible.
[02:20:31.634 --> 02:20:40.821]  But despite all that skewing in the last two weeks, now in major polls put up by the very same groups with the same methodology, Trump is neck and neck with her or even a point or two ahead.
[02:20:41.341 --> 02:20:46.766]  But if you go look at the social media, and Breitbart and Gateway Pundit have done this, it's incredible.
[02:20:47.466 --> 02:20:56.793]  We're talking three, four, five, six times the support at places like Facebook, Livestream, Reddit, and so many other places.
[02:20:57.033 --> 02:21:00.916]  In fact, sometimes he's got ten times more likes and ten times more views.
[02:21:01.557 --> 02:21:05.340]  That's what we saw with Bernie Sanders, where he'd have 20,000 people, Hillary'd have 500.
[02:21:06.140 --> 02:21:14.767]  We did exit polls in California and other so-called battleground states in the Democratic primary, and we talked to eight people before we found one or two Hillary supporters.
[02:21:15.327 --> 02:21:18.548]  That's why Hillary was forced to steal it with the superdelegates.
[02:21:19.208 --> 02:21:20.808]  Let's look at some of the numbers themselves.
[02:21:21.729 --> 02:21:26.610]  Trump had 10 million plus likes to Clinton's 5 million on Facebook.
[02:21:26.970 --> 02:21:34.792]  And that's with Facebook admittedly censoring Trump pages everywhere they can and even meeting with Hillary Clinton just like Google does.
[02:21:35.757 --> 02:21:43.603]  Trump averages 30,000 live viewers per stream, and Clinton averages 500 live stream viewers per stream.
[02:21:44.023 --> 02:21:48.426]  On Reddit, Trump averages 197,000 plus subscribers, Hillary 24,000.
[02:21:48.906 --> 02:21:53.349]  Hillary for prison has 55,000 subscribers.
[02:21:53.630 --> 02:21:54.890]  Gee, wonder who started that.
[02:21:55.491 --> 02:21:59.494]  And this is only a snapshot of the numbers we're seeing with Trump.
[02:21:59.914 --> 02:22:03.456]  You go to YouTube, his average video has millions of views.
[02:22:04.517 --> 02:22:06.899]  You go look at Hillary's official campaign site.
[02:22:07.459 --> 02:22:09.381]  Most of her videos have 2,000 or 3,000 views.
[02:22:09.441 --> 02:22:10.902]  Her bigger one's a few hundred thousand.
[02:22:11.242 --> 02:22:12.403]  This lady's a joke.
[02:22:12.783 --> 02:22:14.124]  She's not liked by her own party.
[02:22:14.425 --> 02:22:21.110]  But we're being told it's going to be a landslide for her because they're trying to get us ready for election fraud.
[02:22:21.490 --> 02:22:24.632]  Something so well documented in this country's past.
[02:22:25.813 --> 02:22:27.855]  But Obama says it's preposterous.
[02:22:28.235 --> 02:22:30.137]  He doesn't even know what that is.
[02:22:30.937 --> 02:22:32.879]  Well, President Obama, we do know what it is.
[02:22:33.666 --> 02:22:39.550]  And this time, we don't have somebody like Mitt Romney or John McCain who's gonna stand down and not take action.
[02:22:39.870 --> 02:22:42.031]  We don't have somebody who's gonna throw in the towel there's fraud.
[02:22:42.292 --> 02:22:46.574]  We've got Donald Trump and an awake population that's aware of your scams.
[02:22:47.635 --> 02:22:49.276]  The social engineers have jumped the shark.
[02:22:49.696 --> 02:22:51.718]  They are stealing this election in front of everyone.
[02:22:52.598 --> 02:22:56.421]  By forcing them to engage in fraud, we are exposing them forever.
[02:22:56.761 --> 02:23:01.384]  So even if Donald Trump loses, even if that happens due to fraud,
[02:23:02.332 --> 02:23:02.892]  Or scandals.
[02:23:03.293 --> 02:23:08.616]  It doesn't matter because we've been in the arena, we've politically exposed the system, political correctness, globalism.
[02:23:09.056 --> 02:23:10.316]  The maxim has been introduced.
[02:23:10.657 --> 02:23:12.118]  Americanism, not globalism.
[02:23:12.918 --> 02:23:14.979]  This is a good time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:23:15.339 --> 02:23:21.403]  And we owe Donald Trump so much for being willing to put his family, his life, his treasure on the line.
[02:23:21.823 --> 02:23:23.064]  He is the man in the arena.
[02:23:23.664 --> 02:23:25.425]  And I'm honored to be in that arena with him as well.
[02:23:25.885 --> 02:23:30.468]  If you haven't joined us in this historic fight, it's time to pick a side right now.
[02:23:41.061 --> 02:23:42.701]  The talk show host is Alex Jones.
[02:23:42.922 --> 02:23:44.622]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:23:44.702 --> 02:23:47.423]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[02:23:47.623 --> 02:23:48.443]  Alex Jones.
[02:23:48.523 --> 02:23:51.284]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:23:51.344 --> 02:23:54.545]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:23:54.585 --> 02:23:55.885]  Deeply, I think, racist.
[02:23:56.005 --> 02:23:57.826]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[02:23:57.946 --> 02:23:59.746]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[02:23:59.766 --> 02:24:03.847]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[02:24:03.867 --> 02:24:05.028]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:05.088 --> 02:24:09.989]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:24:13.138 --> 02:24:14.338]  I'll be honest with you.
[02:24:14.619 --> 02:24:19.240]  I'm sitting here during the break, thinking about what I want to come back and talk about, and there's just too much to talk about.
[02:24:19.840 --> 02:24:26.403]  And it's all so crazy, I'm like, what are the words to describe how serious this is?
[02:24:26.523 --> 02:24:27.503]  You shouldn't even be on air.
[02:24:27.843 --> 02:24:29.784]  You're not freaking out enough to get people's attention.
[02:24:29.824 --> 02:24:30.804]  This is an emergency.
[02:24:31.304 --> 02:24:34.265]  Because if we just calmly talk about this, it'll just normalize it all.
[02:24:35.646 --> 02:24:37.967]  I mean, for two years, I've watched Alexa run by
[02:24:39.292 --> 02:24:47.814]  Amazon, every libertarian, nationalist, patriot, mainline Christian group, thousands and thousands of websites just delisted.
[02:24:47.834 --> 02:24:48.995]  They just say you have no traffic.
[02:24:50.255 --> 02:24:54.896]  All the same day, in the middle of October 2014.
[02:24:55.816 --> 02:24:57.957]  Now they're going to run the smart houses in your house.
[02:24:59.797 --> 02:25:00.618]  Do you understand folks?
[02:25:00.678 --> 02:25:01.458]  It's economic war.
[02:25:01.558 --> 02:25:05.399]  If they can shut you down and say you have no traffic, and then you can't sell advertising,
[02:25:06.943 --> 02:25:09.905]  And the big third-party advertising sites won't do deals with you.
[02:25:10.966 --> 02:25:12.767]  You have been economically depressed.
[02:25:13.708 --> 02:25:17.891]  Just like the Nazis would block different areas where they didn't want people to get any business.
[02:25:19.226 --> 02:25:21.668]  This is such an assault and I didn't mean to go back into this.
[02:25:21.768 --> 02:25:36.259]  It's just going back to Michael Snyder, getting into the economy and the gaming of things and the rigging and the ABC News cutting, you know, live feeds of Trump and saying technical difficulties whenever he talks about Hillary is, you know, the founder of ISIS.
[02:25:36.359 --> 02:25:38.821]  I mean, they admit they're doing it.
[02:25:38.841 --> 02:25:42.184]  They have all these articles admitting they're skewing the news now like it's a good thing.
[02:25:42.404 --> 02:25:48.669]  I mean, I'm sure you've seen the State Department spokesman, the head spokesman going, hey, we got college kids here to learn about freedom and being truthful.
[02:25:49.609 --> 02:25:50.170]  Ridiculous!
[02:25:50.410 --> 02:25:51.351]  Oh, it is from scams!
[02:25:51.872 --> 02:25:52.913]  Oh, yes!
[02:25:53.153 --> 02:25:55.295]  I mean, it's like it's reached maniac level.
[02:25:55.335 --> 02:25:56.116]  What is going on here?
[02:25:57.557 --> 02:26:07.681]  Well, you know, we live in a time when spin is everything, and they want to make, you know, and now the whole goal is to make the Obama administration look good so that, you know, support will go to Hillary.
[02:26:07.721 --> 02:26:10.622]  Like, just look at this job number that came out on Friday.
[02:26:10.963 --> 02:26:15.445]  They said, oh, 255,000 jobs added to the economy last month.
[02:26:15.525 --> 02:26:22.608]  But what they didn't tell you is there was a massive seasonal adjustment added, which made it look far better than it actually was.
[02:26:22.648 --> 02:26:25.669]  So if you look at the unadjusted numbers, for example, private payrolls,
[02:26:26.449 --> 02:26:35.959]  You know, according to the report, 217,000 jobs were added to private payrolls, but the unadjusted number was actually just 85,000 jobs added to private payrolls.
[02:26:36.340 --> 02:26:40.124]  And by the way, that's classic summer picking that's going on.
[02:26:41.226 --> 02:26:49.075]  Yeah, but we need about 150,000 jobs or so each month just to keep up with population growth.
[02:26:49.135 --> 02:26:52.739]  So really last month, we didn't even keep up with population growth.
[02:26:53.059 --> 02:26:57.724]  And as you said, the Wall Street Journal says the worst recovery in modern history, that's with fake numbers.
[02:26:57.784 --> 02:27:01.509]  If they said the economy's at 1.8 growing, what is that, like 2-3% negative?
[02:27:01.529 --> 02:27:02.510]  That's a full-blown depression.
[02:27:03.612 --> 02:27:08.134]  Yeah, according to John Williams of shadowstats.com, who's been tracking this for years, U.S.
[02:27:08.175 --> 02:27:20.701]  economy's been actually in negative GDP growth all the way back to 2005, but even looking at their manipulated numbers, you know, for the, you know, the quarter that just ended... By the way, three quarters of negative is a depression.
[02:27:21.642 --> 02:27:21.882]  Yeah.
[02:27:21.982 --> 02:27:23.383]  And we're talking ten years of it.
[02:27:24.753 --> 02:27:30.475]  But even looking at their manipulated numbers for the last quarter, it was 1.2% economic growth.
[02:27:30.695 --> 02:27:34.637]  The previous quarter was revised down to 0.8%.
[02:27:35.317 --> 02:27:51.443]  And then if you look at Obama's term and his presidency as a whole, Barack Obama is on track, even with the manipulated numbers, he's on track to be the only president in all of US history to never have a single year of 3% economic growth.
[02:27:51.723 --> 02:27:53.064]  And he's had two terms to do it.
[02:27:53.084 --> 02:27:54.044]  Let me raise this key.
[02:27:54.324 --> 02:27:56.585]  Michael Snyder, if you're an expert on this, you follow it so closely.
[02:27:56.605 --> 02:28:00.407]  You write these great boil-down analysis articles that I love, four or five pages long.
[02:28:00.727 --> 02:28:04.729]  Every sentence is a documented link at TheEconomicCollapseBlog.com.
[02:28:05.369 --> 02:28:06.210]  Here's the big issue.
[02:28:07.541 --> 02:28:22.407]  And they've got charts on this, as you know, Zero Edge has done it, we've done it, you've done it, where every incumbent or every party that's about to try to stay in power, if there is a stock market crash or an economic downturn, the party out of power gets in.
[02:28:22.728 --> 02:28:25.909]  We know they crashed it in 2007, 2008 for Obama.
[02:28:26.129 --> 02:28:27.770]  Wall Street engineered that, it's admitted now.
[02:28:28.490 --> 02:28:29.631]  They're trying to prop it up.
[02:28:29.671 --> 02:28:32.532]  The question is, can they prop it up until Hillary gets in?
[02:28:34.144 --> 02:28:35.885]  Well, I think that's what they want to do.
[02:28:35.985 --> 02:28:38.486]  I think they want to prop it up, at least through the election.
[02:28:38.586 --> 02:28:38.886]  Why?
[02:28:38.906 --> 02:28:55.954]  Well, if you go all the way back to 1928, and if you look at the last three months, and this is the period we're entering now, the last three months before the election, if during those three months, the three months leading up to the election, if the stock market goes up, the incumbent party wins.
[02:28:57.375 --> 02:29:00.278]  But if the stock market goes down, the incumbent party loses.
[02:29:00.298 --> 02:29:04.862]  The only times that have not been the case, it's happened three times.
[02:29:04.882 --> 02:29:06.784]  1956, 1968, and 1980.
[02:29:07.845 --> 02:29:11.788]  Now, of course, this election is kind of breaking all the rules, and who knows if it'll hold up.
[02:29:12.149 --> 02:29:16.372]  But for those who want Donald Trump to win, which would be most of your audience,
[02:29:17.324 --> 02:29:24.991]  Those who want Trump to win should be hoping, actually, for the stock market to go down during these three months, because that's going to throw perhaps more support.
[02:29:25.351 --> 02:29:36.681]  I don't engage in nerdy pool, but I tell you, anything to stop Hillary, anything to stop her getting four or five more Supreme Court justices, I mean, I think it's already so staged.
[02:29:36.701 --> 02:29:41.426]  They can have the Plunge Protection Team, the President's Open Group on Markets prop it up.
[02:29:41.866 --> 02:29:47.631]  But I tell you, it's a legal and lawful way to pull your money out to send a message against the establishment.
[02:29:49.272 --> 02:29:51.995]  But I hate to call for a stock market crash, even if it's rigged.
[02:29:52.595 --> 02:29:56.018]  Let's talk about is it possible or will they just prop it up?
[02:29:56.058 --> 02:29:57.139]  Michael Snyder, stay with us.
[02:29:59.741 --> 02:30:00.642]  We're on the march.
[02:30:01.122 --> 02:30:02.724]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.664 --> 02:30:06.367]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.649 --> 02:30:12.491]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:30:12.551 --> 02:30:14.412]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:30:14.573 --> 02:30:17.375]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:30:17.475 --> 02:30:23.340]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:30:23.540 --> 02:30:30.907]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[02:30:31.047 --> 02:30:32.408]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:30:32.708 --> 02:30:37.611]  Whether it's your home or office, yo, it's yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[02:30:37.791 --> 02:30:39.952]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:30:40.252 --> 02:30:47.977]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:30:48.297 --> 02:30:49.238]  The general public doesn't.
[02:30:50.473 --> 02:30:52.774]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:30:53.834 --> 02:30:57.815]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:30:57.975 --> 02:31:04.458]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:31:04.678 --> 02:31:08.779]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:31:10.678 --> 02:31:21.085]  Video from Donald Trump's speech in Daytona Beach last week shows ABC News cutting the live feed as Trump begins to talk about Hillary Clinton's connections to ISIS, as reported by Paul Joseph Watson of InfoWars.com.
[02:31:21.246 --> 02:31:27.050]  Before the feed was cut, Trump said, quote, take a look at Orlando, take a look at San Bernardino, take a look at the World Trade Center.
[02:31:27.130 --> 02:31:28.911]  And we let ISIS take this position.
[02:31:29.031 --> 02:31:33.114]  It was Hillary Clinton that she should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS.
[02:31:33.354 --> 02:31:37.517]  And right after Trump made that statement, ABC News cut the feed and went to background music.
[02:31:37.737 --> 02:31:41.259]  ABC isn't the only network to cut the feed when someone's critical of Hillary.
[02:31:41.379 --> 02:31:50.904]  Last month, for example, CNN cut its own feed when a reporter pointed out that Hillary's support for anti-crime legislation in the 90s led to the mass incarceration of African Americans.
[02:31:51.284 --> 02:31:59.809]  And, Hillary's support of jihadists in the Middle East, particularly in Libya and Syria while serving as Secretary of State, has directly led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Muslims.
[02:32:00.029 --> 02:32:04.115]  The fact the mainstream media keeps downplaying while claiming Trump is, quote, Islamophobic.
[02:32:04.315 --> 02:32:07.199]  And to find out more, visit InfoWars.com.
[02:32:07.340 --> 02:32:08.662]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[02:32:10.495 --> 02:32:16.678]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:32:17.058 --> 02:32:19.939]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:32:20.279 --> 02:32:25.461]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:32:25.881 --> 02:32:31.864]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:32:32.004 --> 02:32:35.145]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:32:35.285 --> 02:32:36.726]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[02:32:36.946 --> 02:32:41.070]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:32:41.270 --> 02:32:44.132]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:32:44.212 --> 02:32:45.794]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:32:45.894 --> 02:32:49.077]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:32:49.357 --> 02:32:51.679]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:32:51.959 --> 02:32:52.920]  It's in powder form.
[02:32:53.020 --> 02:32:55.722]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[02:32:55.903 --> 02:32:56.503]  I take this.
[02:32:56.603 --> 02:32:58.305]  This is the product that I take.
[02:32:58.425 --> 02:33:00.387]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[02:33:01.207 --> 02:33:01.988]  We fight the Globals.
[02:33:02.008 --> 02:33:02.848]  We fight the New World Order.

[02:33:08.111 --> 02:33:13.413]  We are on the march.
[02:33:13.473 --> 02:33:16.735]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:33:16.755 --> 02:33:22.618]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:22.938 --> 02:33:26.079]  I'm waiting in my cold cell.
[02:33:33.550 --> 02:33:37.311]  Reflecting on my past life.
[02:33:39.152 --> 02:33:42.733]  It's so frustrating to know we're right.
[02:33:43.473 --> 02:33:44.734]  It's so frustrating.
[02:33:47.515 --> 02:33:49.956]  To know that we've already made such big inroads against the enemy.
[02:33:51.736 --> 02:33:53.417]  With the weakness of our people.
[02:33:55.461 --> 02:34:13.590]  It's what makes me think deep down, at least for this round, humanity is going to go through something that's going to make World War II and the 50 plus million dead look like a walk in the park.
[02:34:15.651 --> 02:34:17.332]  Good in the world is running low.
[02:34:19.353 --> 02:34:20.013]  Running low.
[02:34:22.855 --> 02:34:24.776]  That is good in high places is running low.
[02:34:26.084 --> 02:34:35.287]  And then they act like it's the end of the world that Donald Trump is an anti-globalist and doesn't want to sign one-sided deals to screw us over.
[02:34:35.807 --> 02:34:37.947]  And is it for their big plan?
[02:34:41.949 --> 02:34:49.731]  And to just see the corporate media engage in levels of deception that I have never seen before.
[02:34:52.751 --> 02:34:57.199]  They even celebrate on C-SPAN how dumb we are and how they're lying to us.
[02:34:57.320 --> 02:34:59.404]  Look at you, dumb little scum.
[02:35:00.025 --> 02:35:01.988]  Oh, we're gonna screw you over.
[02:35:04.961 --> 02:35:09.343]  In the movie, Facing the Crowd, came out in the 1950s, is where Andy Griffith got so famous.
[02:35:09.363 --> 02:35:10.364]  Everybody should see it.
[02:35:10.964 --> 02:35:19.088]  He's a con man, becomes his national TV host, and during the end of a show, when he thinks the audio's off, he's like, look at you dumb idiots.
[02:35:19.629 --> 02:35:21.029]  Look at you morons.
[02:35:21.070 --> 02:35:22.550]  You don't know I'm screwing you over.
[02:35:23.551 --> 02:35:26.613]  Oh, you're such a... I remember seeing that as a kid going, that's mean.
[02:35:26.633 --> 02:35:27.373]  They love him.
[02:35:27.433 --> 02:35:28.353]  They support him.
[02:35:28.834 --> 02:35:30.455]  Why would he want to be mean to his fans?
[02:35:31.385 --> 02:35:34.266]  And see, I was so naive when I was younger because I am a good person.
[02:35:34.286 --> 02:35:35.687]  I mean, I really care about people.
[02:35:37.208 --> 02:35:40.730]  And that's Conrad Lorenz's animal psychology.
[02:35:40.770 --> 02:35:44.551]  The truth is I'm extremely vicious if I need to be.
[02:35:44.611 --> 02:35:45.172]  I'm not bragging.
[02:35:45.252 --> 02:35:46.112]  A lot of men are like that.
[02:35:46.132 --> 02:35:47.733]  But I mean, I'm crazy.
[02:35:47.833 --> 02:35:54.256]  I mean, it's, you know, it's just... But I have an animal side.
[02:35:54.276 --> 02:35:55.557]  I also have a loving side.
[02:35:56.337 --> 02:35:57.518]  And the more predatory
[02:35:58.522 --> 02:36:02.186]  A species is, the more it has a big loving side for its own species.
[02:36:02.747 --> 02:36:05.730]  The globalists, though, do not have that governor.
[02:36:05.810 --> 02:36:06.851]  They hate us.
[02:36:07.211 --> 02:36:08.453]  They see us as the prey.
[02:36:09.634 --> 02:36:16.261]  And so, I didn't understand criminology when I was 10 years old and first saw Face of the Crowd one night with my mom on TV.
[02:36:16.281 --> 02:36:18.824]  And she said, oh, there's a famous movie coming on, let's watch this.
[02:36:18.864 --> 02:36:20.405]  She'd let me watch classic films.
[02:36:22.560 --> 02:36:37.047]  But then as I grew up and took some criminology classes and actually got to know some criminals and people, I realized, my God, they want to brag and they want to screw people over and they finally want to get up and go, I screwed you and I'm dishonorable and a piece of filth!
[02:36:38.588 --> 02:36:43.210]  I'm a Nazi collaborator and I'm not sad for all the Jews I helped kill on 60 Minutes.
[02:36:43.310 --> 02:36:44.931]  He actually said that, George Soros.
[02:36:47.672 --> 02:36:51.714]  And I'm going to fund 35 million to send out cop killers because I'm a big piece of crap.
[02:36:53.137 --> 02:36:54.518]  And you're like, why does he admit it?
[02:36:55.439 --> 02:36:57.861]  Because he wants you to know he did it to you.
[02:36:59.402 --> 02:37:01.583]  If you're not one of them, you don't get it.
[02:37:02.004 --> 02:37:04.766]  That's why good people go, oh, there's not a bunch of corruption and evil.
[02:37:05.166 --> 02:37:06.967]  I mean, come on, nobody would want to do that.
[02:37:06.987 --> 02:37:08.348]  Nobody would want to act like that.
[02:37:08.428 --> 02:37:09.289]  I'm going to go back to our guest.
[02:37:09.309 --> 02:37:10.750]  He's an amazing guy and I always run over him.
[02:37:12.051 --> 02:37:19.497]  But he also used to come home with the other hosts who are a little bit more sedate sometimes, in a good way.
[02:37:20.535 --> 02:37:27.658]  I just sit here looking at all this and the mainstream media organizing itself to lie and saying, we lie because we're good.
[02:37:27.978 --> 02:37:29.298]  And yeah, we censor you.
[02:37:29.918 --> 02:37:31.419]  And yeah, we're going to start arresting you.
[02:37:32.319 --> 02:37:33.120]  We know best.
[02:37:36.501 --> 02:37:38.722]  And they're just a bunch of dumb, lazy totalitarians.
[02:37:39.142 --> 02:37:39.862]  They don't have any honor.
[02:37:40.742 --> 02:37:41.403]  That's what I realized.
[02:37:41.443 --> 02:37:44.824]  It's the rule of the twisted and the weak, historically.
[02:37:45.384 --> 02:37:46.985]  Big armies of nobodies.
[02:37:47.759 --> 02:37:51.762]  Who just get together and decide that, ooh, we found this new thing called evil.
[02:37:52.062 --> 02:37:53.363]  Wow, we really get ahead with it.
[02:37:53.663 --> 02:37:55.444]  Man, no one ever had this before.
[02:37:55.805 --> 02:38:01.048]  Oh, and they just, they go on these crazy power trips like gremlins and everything burns down.
[02:38:03.130 --> 02:38:04.411]  But I guess in a way it's true.
[02:38:04.471 --> 02:38:05.972]  I'm not a social Darwinist.
[02:38:06.072 --> 02:38:13.777]  I'm not a eugenicist, but I see the point, even though they're the ones doing it, that that's how you cull all the snot noses.
[02:38:14.618 --> 02:38:16.079]  So to all the snot noses,
[02:38:18.686 --> 02:38:22.188]  Those of us in the Liberty Movement will be the people that will put everything back together historically.
[02:38:22.228 --> 02:38:22.728]  That's a fact.
[02:38:23.048 --> 02:38:23.568]  That's known.
[02:38:25.069 --> 02:38:28.210]  You are going to be trodden underfoot by your own kind.
[02:38:29.311 --> 02:38:31.772]  And all the little slimy folks in D.C.
[02:38:31.812 --> 02:38:33.693]  and New York and all the other big globalist combines.
[02:38:37.836 --> 02:38:41.238]  I don't have to give you an intellectual argument, even though I have them, or a historical argument.
[02:38:41.618 --> 02:38:45.059]  You know deep down, you people, there's no honor amongst thieves.
[02:38:45.479 --> 02:38:47.880]  When stuff unravels, you are going to be thrown to the side.
[02:38:47.960 --> 02:39:00.186]  Even the richest of you are going to end up in your underground armored fortresses, your keeps, your redoubts, your strongholds, your little getaway palaces.
[02:39:01.542 --> 02:39:06.006]  Your own security details are going to kill you in your own bunker.
[02:39:06.246 --> 02:39:07.607]  I haven't talked to them, I just know they are.
[02:39:10.150 --> 02:39:12.772]  Because they don't trust you when stuff collapses when they're in there.
[02:39:13.372 --> 02:39:15.714]  They're gonna end up occupying your little fortresses.
[02:39:17.216 --> 02:39:21.780]  You're all going to find out how the cow ate the cabbage.
[02:39:22.721 --> 02:39:27.124]  So everyone will be judged and it's appointed to a man to be born once and to die once.
[02:39:28.078 --> 02:39:29.978]  Nobody gets away from being judged.
[02:39:30.498 --> 02:39:32.779]  Nobody rides for free.
[02:39:34.559 --> 02:39:35.039]  Nobody.
[02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:39.920]  You think because you don't have governors you're stronger than those of us that do.
[02:39:40.180 --> 02:39:42.921]  You have no idea what we're going to do once this stuff unfolds.
[02:39:43.341 --> 02:39:44.481]  No idea, trash!
[02:39:46.501 --> 02:39:48.182]  And we won't sit over you and gloat.
[02:39:48.242 --> 02:39:49.542]  We'll move on to the next one of you.
[02:39:49.922 --> 02:39:53.643]  Because we're getting a job done, a mission done, because we love our children.
[02:39:54.543 --> 02:39:55.843]  Not because we hate humanity.
[02:39:58.496 --> 02:40:07.399]  And they're scared because they can just now begin to feel our fingers psychically, culturally, economically, tightening around your throats.
[02:40:11.861 --> 02:40:13.161]  Oh, life hates death, doesn't it?
[02:40:14.221 --> 02:40:15.582]  We're gonna go to our guest here in just a moment.
[02:40:16.442 --> 02:40:18.363]  The times do drive men's souls.
[02:40:19.023 --> 02:40:21.244]  And it is the paradox, the best of times, the worst of times.
[02:40:24.147 --> 02:40:25.028]  I'm not going to belabor this.
[02:40:25.088 --> 02:40:28.851]  We need funds to get more reporters and more writers and to be able to send people more places.
[02:40:29.032 --> 02:40:38.440]  And we have items that everybody needs, from water filtration, to storable foods, to incredibly high-quality non-GMO heirloom, open-pollinated seeds, to high amounts of organic volcanic coffee.
[02:40:39.841 --> 02:40:40.902]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:40:40.962 --> 02:40:41.843]  Free shipping store-wide.
[02:40:41.943 --> 02:40:42.444]  Ends today.
[02:40:42.464 --> 02:40:43.845]  40% off Brain Force.
[02:40:43.885 --> 02:40:44.766]  It's about to sell out.
[02:40:44.786 --> 02:40:45.667]  Could end in the next few hours.
[02:40:47.554 --> 02:40:51.137]  Forty percent off Anthroplex, a news flash sale just today we're running.
[02:40:51.898 --> 02:40:54.641]  And again, there's all the estrogen mimickers, all the garbage out there.
[02:40:55.061 --> 02:40:58.364]  This is put together to be a low-cost, super high-quality formula.
[02:40:58.685 --> 02:40:59.686]  That's what it's designed to do.
[02:41:00.246 --> 02:41:02.488]  At its normal price, it destroys the competition.
[02:41:02.528 --> 02:41:02.969]  It's upwards of $100.
[02:41:04.410 --> 02:41:05.791]  It's a third of that.
[02:41:06.712 --> 02:41:10.316]  Now, it is 40% off for a very limited time.
[02:41:10.456 --> 02:41:12.358]  Anthroplex, experience it for yourself.
[02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:15.401]  Quite frankly, I can't even take one every day.
[02:41:15.421 --> 02:41:17.283]  A lot of people take three or four of them.
[02:41:18.084 --> 02:41:21.107]  But this does not mimic testosterone, folks.
[02:41:21.347 --> 02:41:28.054]  According to Dr. Grip's research, what it does is it's known concentrated organic herbs that go in and basically block all the garbage that's blocking her to testosterone.
[02:41:29.158 --> 02:41:30.759]  Supermoto Vitality is amazing as well.
[02:41:30.839 --> 02:41:33.640]  It's the cold press supercharged version, but it costs more.
[02:41:34.021 --> 02:41:34.901]  They're both excellent.

[02:41:40.104 --> 02:41:45.086]  We've got a new special that's only supposedly going to run for one day, but I haven't even plugged it.
[02:41:45.106 --> 02:41:47.788]  I don't have time and I want to give Mr. Schneider the balance of the hour.
[02:41:48.008 --> 02:41:48.828]  He's got so much to talk about.
[02:41:48.848 --> 02:41:50.369]  I'm just going to let him host.
[02:41:50.589 --> 02:41:53.491]  And of course, you can visit his website as well, but I just really get angry.
[02:41:54.807 --> 02:41:57.048]  I mean, I feel like I'm not doing a good enough job during the break, so I come here and blow up.
[02:41:57.088 --> 02:41:57.628]  That's what happened.
[02:41:58.448 --> 02:42:00.109]  It's not fake.
[02:42:00.149 --> 02:42:00.769]  I'm desperate here.
[02:42:01.529 --> 02:42:02.950]  Because we could win.
[02:42:03.490 --> 02:42:05.351]  But if we don't, the stakes are so bad.
[02:42:06.551 --> 02:42:10.352]  We've got the best solar controllers and solar panel units out there at the price.
[02:42:10.372 --> 02:42:15.054]  We've spent years researching what's the best, and then it gets upgraded every year.
[02:42:15.074 --> 02:42:15.674]  It's better and better.
[02:42:15.774 --> 02:42:17.135]  It's in for a solar base station.
[02:42:20.376 --> 02:42:31.167]  Well, a few things that we don't sell a lot of, so the trolls can give it bad reviews, but it's, I've been told by folks that are into them, it's, most of our stuff is five-star reviews that the trolls that don't sell a lot are able to go in and do fake reviews and then return them.
[02:42:31.307 --> 02:42:33.610]  It's dirty tricks they do, but it's an amazing system.

[02:42:46.894 --> 02:42:47.314]  Check it out.
[02:42:47.394 --> 02:42:50.635]  Okay, I am ranting Michael Snyder of the EconomicCollapseBlog.com.
[02:42:50.655 --> 02:42:53.315]  Get into the economy, get into the dirty tricks, get into the elite.
[02:42:53.855 --> 02:42:57.016]  You know, they admit they have a world collapse program to bring them into power.
[02:42:57.036 --> 02:43:01.636]  That's their own mission, but it's, as one of our guests Matt Bracken says, it's one thing to claim you're going to ride the tiger.
[02:43:01.916 --> 02:43:02.897]  It's another thing to actually do it.
[02:43:02.917 --> 02:43:04.497]  You've got the floor for the next 18 minutes.
[02:43:04.517 --> 02:43:04.757]  Go ahead.
[02:43:06.072 --> 02:43:16.374]  Okay, yeah, Alex, you know, certainly we, here in the United States, actually, things are better in terms of economically, financially, than almost everywhere else in the world.
[02:43:16.414 --> 02:43:17.855]  But things are still not great here.
[02:43:17.875 --> 02:43:26.897]  You know, we're still seeing kind of the long-term decline, the long-term destruction of the middle class that we've been seeing for decades, but it's kind of been accelerating.
[02:43:27.057 --> 02:43:31.838]  Freedom created so much wealth that even though they've been sucking off us for decades, we're still number one.
[02:43:31.878 --> 02:43:32.098]  Go ahead.
[02:43:33.217 --> 02:43:35.660]  Yeah, we just got a brand new number on homeownership.
[02:43:35.780 --> 02:43:43.509]  And just recently, the rate of homeownership in the United States has fallen every single year while Barack Obama's been in office.
[02:43:43.850 --> 02:43:47.674]  But just here recently, it hit the lowest level ever measured.
[02:43:47.855 --> 02:43:50.818]  In other words, the percentage of Americans that actually own their own home
[02:43:51.599 --> 02:43:52.880]  It's the smallest it's ever been.
[02:43:53.320 --> 02:43:54.801]  And so the middle class is shrinking.
[02:43:54.841 --> 02:44:01.364]  In fact, in 2015, last year, we learned for the very first time in American history, the middle class has become a minority.
[02:44:01.905 --> 02:44:10.149]  And so if you add up all the wealthy people and all the poor people, which has been exploding, you add them together, they outnumber the middle class now for the first time ever.
[02:44:10.450 --> 02:44:13.491]  So we're seeing the middle class is being destroyed.
[02:44:13.911 --> 02:44:14.532]  Meanwhile,
[02:44:15.412 --> 02:44:18.674]  In the corporate world, we're seeing all kinds of things similar to what we saw in 2008.
[02:44:19.614 --> 02:44:22.255]  Record profits by these inside bastards.
[02:44:22.275 --> 02:44:22.755]  Look at this one.
[02:44:22.955 --> 02:44:24.876]  The rich get richer as billionaires increase in number.
[02:44:26.177 --> 02:44:30.198]  Yeah, yeah, but now corporations are starting to fall on harder times.
[02:44:30.559 --> 02:44:34.860]  For example, corporate earnings are now down for five months in a row.
[02:44:34.940 --> 02:44:41.003]  So corporations... No, no, I totally agree with you that corporations in general are getting screwed, but the mega ones on the insider group, they're doing great.
[02:44:42.168 --> 02:44:42.929]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[02:44:43.029 --> 02:44:47.454]  But a lot of the ones that aren't in the insider group, they're getting into trouble.
[02:44:47.654 --> 02:44:49.156]  They're getting behind on their debts.
[02:44:49.336 --> 02:44:52.479]  Corporate debt delinquencies are the highest they've been since the crisis of 2008.
[02:44:53.620 --> 02:45:01.389]  Corporate debt defaults, those that are actually defaulting on their debts, the highest since the... And isn't that the canary in the coal mine is corporate defaults because they know first?
[02:45:02.657 --> 02:45:18.614]  Yeah, well, we're seeing huge problems in the energy industry, of course, with the price of oil just going through the floor, falling again here just recently, more than 20% since early June, the price of oil has tumbled, and so this is putting renewed stress on the energy industry.
[02:45:19.134 --> 02:45:24.135]  And people might say, well, I can go to the gas station and get cheaper gas, but it's killing jobs.
[02:45:24.175 --> 02:45:32.958]  Since mid-2014, we've lost 195,000 energy jobs, good-paying energy jobs, in the United States alone.
[02:45:33.198 --> 02:45:36.819]  And these are the kind of middle-class jobs which we actually need to have a middle class.
[02:45:37.239 --> 02:45:46.266]  I mean, you can't replace an oil field job, an energy job with, you know, even a whole bunch of part-time jobs stocking the shelves at Walmart.
[02:45:46.647 --> 02:45:50.049]  You know, if we're going to have a thriving middle class, we need middle class jobs.
[02:45:50.350 --> 02:46:01.799]  And then this crash in the price of oil is also putting pressure on financial institutions all over Wall Street that are heavily involved in the energy industry with making them loans, with derivatives, with everything else.
[02:46:02.339 --> 02:46:08.942]  So this renewed crash in the price of oil is putting renewed stress on the financial markets and all over the world.
[02:46:09.502 --> 02:46:12.224]  And here in the United States, you know, we've got our too-big-to-fail banks.
[02:46:12.544 --> 02:46:14.945]  But overseas, it's even worse.
[02:46:14.965 --> 02:46:16.285]  So what is your prediction?
[02:46:16.325 --> 02:46:17.766]  What's the real state of the global economy?
[02:46:17.906 --> 02:46:19.447]  Mega-recession or depression?
[02:46:20.660 --> 02:46:24.381]  Well, much of the global economy has already fallen into recession.
[02:46:24.421 --> 02:46:25.161]  The U.S.
[02:46:25.761 --> 02:46:28.622]  is actually in better shape than almost everyone else in the world.
[02:46:28.682 --> 02:46:31.983]  I mean, you look at the country hosting the Olympics right now, Brazil.
[02:46:32.043 --> 02:46:34.563]  They were the 7th largest economy on the planet.
[02:46:34.603 --> 02:46:40.744]  Now they've fallen down to 9th because they're in their worst economic depression since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
[02:46:40.865 --> 02:46:47.166]  In fact, CNN ran an article not too long ago where they said, Brazil, economic collapse, worse than feared.
[02:46:47.566 --> 02:46:52.796]  So CNN is actually admitting that Brazil is experiencing an economic collapse.
[02:46:53.137 --> 02:46:54.459]  Their infrastructure is falling.
[02:46:54.499 --> 02:46:55.501]  What about Venezuela?
[02:46:56.581 --> 02:47:17.775]  Yeah, Venezuela is right next door to Brazil, where in Venezuela, I just posted an article about this just a few days ago, where in Venezuela, some people were so desperate for food that they actually broke into a zoo and they've been taking the zoo animals, and at first they started with the sheep and the pigs, but then they actually pulled a black stallion out of the cage and slaughtered it for meat.
[02:47:18.155 --> 02:47:19.896]  Because they were so hungry.
[02:47:20.376 --> 02:47:31.263]  And not too long ago, just a few months ago, a mayor down there in Venezuela came out and said people in his area are killing, they're hunting down dogs and cats and pigeons for food.
[02:47:31.443 --> 02:47:34.265]  Yeah, people's pets are being gobbled up.
[02:47:35.353 --> 02:47:41.055]  Yeah, because, and there's not money to feed the pets anyway, not money to feed the animals in the zoo.
[02:47:41.115 --> 02:47:49.358]  Something to go along with the zoo story is that, you know, yeah, they're breaking in and killing these animals, but more animals have actually died from starvation in the zoos.
[02:47:49.458 --> 02:47:50.358]  Dozens of animals have died.
[02:47:50.378 --> 02:47:51.158]  Sure, so it's better to eat them.
[02:47:51.178 --> 02:47:52.179]  Let me ask you this then.
[02:47:53.239 --> 02:47:54.519]  How is it going for the globalists?
[02:47:54.539 --> 02:47:59.301]  Because they admitted they wanted to have a worldwide economic collapse to consolidate control, but it doesn't look like it's going the way they wanted it to.
[02:48:00.731 --> 02:48:06.796]  Yeah, well, the globalists are not all powerful, but yeah, they would like to accelerate their program.
[02:48:06.816 --> 02:48:11.019]  Now, here in the United States, they'd like to keep things together long enough to make sure Trump doesn't get in.
[02:48:11.599 --> 02:48:17.344]  But, you know, globally, they do want to accelerate their New World Order, but there's been a rebellion among the people.
[02:48:17.384 --> 02:48:19.486]  We saw the Brexit vote, where the people of
[02:48:20.106 --> 02:48:26.455]  The United Kingdom, you know, Great Britain said, well, no, we don't want to be part of the European Union.
[02:48:26.515 --> 02:48:30.581]  It was a rebuke to globalism, which I think kind of stunned the globalists.
[02:48:30.641 --> 02:48:35.848]  So I think that set their program a bit on a number of fronts around the world.
[02:48:36.929 --> 02:48:42.571]  Well, they've said in the Washington Post, they've said in the Financial Times, everywhere, globalism is in crisis, the worst threat ever.
[02:48:42.591 --> 02:48:56.616]  But aren't these animals like bears and black stallions being eaten, horses, indicative of, quite frankly, huge cities collapsing, are like locusts, where within 10 days most people become cannibals.
[02:48:56.696 --> 02:49:03.079]  I mean, if we have a global societal collapse, anywhere near the Great Depression, it is going to be spectacular.
[02:49:04.568 --> 02:49:06.710]  Yeah, desperate people do desperate things.
[02:49:06.790 --> 02:49:08.792]  And here in the United States, we're not too far away.
[02:49:09.093 --> 02:49:15.018]  One recent survey found 62% of all Americans have less than $1,000 in savings.
[02:49:15.519 --> 02:49:23.107]  And other surveys have found over half the country have less than a three-day supply of non-perishable food and supplies.
[02:49:23.727 --> 02:49:24.387]  I don't think so.
[02:49:41.397 --> 02:49:47.759]  You know, people, you know, they tune in every day, they listen hour after hour after hour, but many of them have never financially supported you.
[02:49:47.799 --> 02:49:53.741]  You know, they'll go out and spend hundreds of dollars with New World Order companies, but you know, why not support Alex Jones?
[02:49:53.841 --> 02:49:58.943]  Absolutely, and support The Economic Collapse Blog dot com, and Mr. Snyderson, but I want to be point blank with you.
[02:49:59.545 --> 02:50:08.573]  I got on Talk Radio 21 years ago and they said, look, with conservatives and people, and conservative talk radio hosts, you know, storable food's a really big thing.
[02:50:08.593 --> 02:50:10.054]  And I'm like, what's storable food?
[02:50:10.094 --> 02:50:11.516]  I mean, yeah, grandma cans and stuff.
[02:50:11.536 --> 02:50:13.057]  You mean, no, they believe in it.
[02:50:13.077 --> 02:50:14.538]  A lot of your listeners are Mormon.
[02:50:14.699 --> 02:50:16.140]  You know, we got some Mormon sponsors.
[02:50:16.200 --> 02:50:16.740]  I was like, okay.
[02:50:17.481 --> 02:50:20.866]  Folks, you should have food for a storm or an earthquake or a crisis.
[02:50:21.247 --> 02:50:23.630]  Hopefully you never need it, but it's insurance you could eat.
[02:50:23.650 --> 02:50:24.812]  That was always a staple sponsor.
[02:50:25.193 --> 02:50:27.156]  People know I've never been a huge food pusher.
[02:50:27.216 --> 02:50:31.302]  Even I thought Y2K was a fraud until the last few weeks when he was like, oh, it's all going to happen.
[02:50:32.227 --> 02:50:34.208]  But regardless, you know, you got to fund your operations.
[02:50:34.228 --> 02:50:35.228]  You try to fund it with moral stuff.
[02:50:35.268 --> 02:50:36.449]  You know, selling food is a good thing.
[02:50:36.849 --> 02:50:42.771]  But let me tell you, I mean, now I've been selling a ton of food and the listeners are buying it because we're all getting it.
[02:50:42.791 --> 02:50:47.654]  I mean, I have been putting solar panels here, gas power generators here at my house, panels.
[02:50:48.174 --> 02:50:50.455]  I've been getting the old farmhouse ready in East Texas.
[02:50:51.641 --> 02:50:59.265]  Because collapse has gone from possibility to probability to near certainty.
[02:50:59.285 --> 02:51:02.987]  I mean, I liken us to mountains, which are islands.
[02:51:03.227 --> 02:51:07.049]  So there's an ocean of tyranny and corruption and death and starvation rising.
[02:51:07.369 --> 02:51:09.030]  And we're way up here on a tall mountain.
[02:51:09.070 --> 02:51:09.510]  But you know what?
[02:51:09.530 --> 02:51:12.532]  I see that water getting closer and closer and closer.
[02:51:12.572 --> 02:51:14.153]  We had a house by the lake when I was a kid.
[02:51:15.274 --> 02:51:18.999]  And, I mean, we weren't right on the water.
[02:51:19.039 --> 02:51:29.293]  We were the houses up from the water, on a hill, probably a hundred feet above the water, but, you know, with the grade, maybe a thousand yards from the water.
[02:51:30.154 --> 02:51:44.859]  And I remember horrible floods where it kept raining, and finally the water came up, up, up, up, up the back porch in the house, and pretty soon we were moving furniture upstairs, two-story, into it, and it just, they had to put a sheetrock, everything, and it ruined the bottom of the house.
[02:51:45.199 --> 02:51:47.860]  And who would have ever thought that water would have gotten all the way up there?
[02:51:47.980 --> 02:51:48.880]  Oh, it's gonna flood.
[02:51:49.140 --> 02:51:52.622]  We watched it in the weeks of raining come right up to us like Noah's Flood.
[02:51:52.702 --> 02:51:59.344]  And now, I've gone from seeing the water way down there again in my life, being tyranny and collapse, it's now lapping my back porch.
[02:51:59.924 --> 02:52:01.707]  And I'm not like, oh good, I was right!
[02:52:01.848 --> 02:52:06.075]  I'm like, oh my god, is it gonna go just to the first floor, Michael Snyder?
[02:52:06.316 --> 02:52:08.760]  Or how high is this water gonna go if we have a worldwide collapse?
[02:52:09.980 --> 02:52:16.582]  Well, I hope your listeners, I hope everyone can see that we're reaching a pressure point, especially as we come up to the election here.
[02:52:16.682 --> 02:52:27.784]  I think this is a key moment that, unlike anything we've seen in years, and the more support Donald Trump gets, the more pressure the elite are going to feel to do something.
[02:52:27.804 --> 02:52:32.925]  You know, Barack Obama, he just came out the other day and said, oh, Donald Trump's unfit to be president.
[02:52:32.965 --> 02:52:35.326]  He said, oh, you know, I always thought John McCain or
[02:52:35.706 --> 02:52:39.129]  Mitt Romney, if they won the election, that they could have functioned as president.
[02:52:39.370 --> 02:52:41.271]  But he says, with Donald Trump, that's not the case.
[02:52:41.331 --> 02:52:49.299]  Now, if Barack Obama really means that, will he willingly and peacefully transfer over power if Donald Trump wins the election?
[02:52:49.339 --> 02:52:50.840]  Someone needs to ask him that question.
[02:52:51.101 --> 02:52:59.709]  Barack Obama actually means all these things he's been saying about- If he says he's unfit, you say he's unfit, and so will you transfer power if he's elected?
[02:53:01.001 --> 02:53:02.802]  Yeah, and so someone needs to ask him about that.
[02:53:02.822 --> 02:53:09.264]  But also, as we get closer to the election, and the closer the polls are, the more support Donald Trump has.
[02:53:09.324 --> 02:53:26.849]  If it looks like it's going to be close or Donald Trump may win, we need to be on the alert for false flags, some type of crisis, something that will bring a disruption to the paradigm, something that will derail because, you know, the elite don't want to take any chances.
[02:53:27.650 --> 02:53:37.770]  You know, we need to be on alert because, like I said, this is a pressure point which could cause the elite to overplay their hand to show who they really are and to do desperate things.
[02:53:38.951 --> 02:53:39.672]  Well, I agree.
[02:53:39.832 --> 02:53:43.775]  And look, they have this shadowy AP group that always announces the elections.
[02:53:43.795 --> 02:53:46.137]  They keep getting caught defrauding people, so they keep changing the name.
[02:53:46.157 --> 02:53:48.839]  They're the ones that called it for Sanders and all those states he really won.
[02:53:48.859 --> 02:53:50.921]  And that's even in New York Daily News and Zero Hedge.
[02:53:51.621 --> 02:53:54.764]  So, I put a 12-minute report together, and I'm begging everyone.
[02:53:55.264 --> 02:53:56.085]  I don't want the credit.
[02:53:56.205 --> 02:53:56.885]  I don't care.
[02:53:57.606 --> 02:54:00.068]  Quite frankly, it's so dangerous to always be the one at the tip of the spear.
[02:54:00.128 --> 02:54:04.271]  I mean, when we look at Trump, 48 hours after I said, you know, come out with all the fraud, he did, word for word.
[02:54:04.952 --> 02:54:08.275]  And, you know, I know for sure he got it from me, but I'll just leave it at that.
[02:54:10.313 --> 02:54:15.574]  We need everybody to make this the big central issue so the establishment understands we're not just going to go quietly into the night.
[02:54:17.535 --> 02:54:18.315]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:54:18.335 --> 02:54:20.135]  And everyone has a way that they can contribute.
[02:54:20.255 --> 02:54:27.137]  Now, what I do is... Go ahead, Michael.
[02:54:29.357 --> 02:54:29.697]  You're fine.
[02:54:29.717 --> 02:54:31.118]  We might have been sending you audio from that video.
[02:54:31.138 --> 02:54:31.598]  Sorry, Schneider.
[02:54:31.638 --> 02:54:31.858]  Go ahead.
[02:54:32.659 --> 02:54:33.179]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:54:36.340 --> 02:54:37.821]  Everyone needs to contribute.
[02:54:37.841 --> 02:54:39.441]  Now's not the time to sit on the sidelines.
[02:54:39.481 --> 02:54:41.262]  Now, personally, what can I do?
[02:54:41.382 --> 02:54:45.263]  I live in the middle of nowhere, up in the mountains, but what I can do is write.
[02:54:45.503 --> 02:54:49.564]  And so I've been gifted with writing, and I write, and it makes an impact out there.
[02:54:49.604 --> 02:54:50.805]  By the way, let me interrupt you.
[02:54:52.305 --> 02:54:54.706]  I don't know your numbers, but I see your stuff everywhere.
[02:54:54.866 --> 02:54:55.466]  Let me guess.
[02:54:56.466 --> 02:54:57.267]  Let me be conservative.
[02:54:58.147 --> 02:55:00.968]  What do you get, a million, two million individual readers a month?
[02:55:02.435 --> 02:55:10.221]  Yeah, on my one website alone, the EconomicCollapseBlog.com alone gets more than a million page impressions each month, and that's just one of my websites.
[02:55:10.241 --> 02:55:10.981]  Okay, so let me stop you.
[02:55:11.222 --> 02:55:12.483]  And you've been around, what, six, seven years?
[02:55:13.563 --> 02:55:16.085]  Yeah, since the Economic Collapse Blog, since late 2009.
[02:55:16.225 --> 02:55:18.227]  Okay, so let me just go in from memory.
[02:55:18.247 --> 02:55:19.208]  We'll just test it out.
[02:55:19.388 --> 02:55:20.248]  That's my little noggin here.
[02:55:21.309 --> 02:55:22.090]  Teleprompter free, folks.
[02:55:23.211 --> 02:55:23.551]  Powered by 1776.
[02:55:25.655 --> 02:55:26.535]  See, this is what I'm saying.
[02:55:26.776 --> 02:55:33.939]  There's such a vacuum of real news and info that we don't have to let them just kill the economy and then sit there and beg them.
[02:55:34.319 --> 02:55:35.720]  If we build it, they will come.
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:42.203]  But you had to hammer and hammer and hammer, tell the truth, engage in good analysis, have people trust you, do a great job.
[02:55:42.243 --> 02:55:47.966]  Now you're all over talk radio, you're doing your own shows, you're reaching on, you got like three or four websites reaching a couple million people a month.
[02:55:48.066 --> 02:55:49.367]  I was guessing, I guess it's higher than that.
[02:55:49.927 --> 02:55:51.849]  And that's the success story.
[02:55:52.189 --> 02:55:57.974]  And that's the great thing about this, is that we are better than the globalists if we get in the arena.
[02:55:57.994 --> 02:55:58.275]  Go ahead.
[02:55:59.522 --> 02:56:07.066]  Oh yeah, and my point is that anyone can do it because, you know, you go back a decade, I was about as anonymous as you could possibly get.
[02:56:07.086 --> 02:56:15.970]  I was working in the heart of DC, kind of in the heart of darkness there, but I would put on my little headphones while I was working when I could and listen to Alex Jones and be like, well, what could I do?
[02:56:16.091 --> 02:56:25.876]  I'm a nobody, but I took action and I stuck with it at first, you know, very, very little impact at all, but I stuck with it and over time it built up.
[02:56:25.936 --> 02:56:27.737]  I was about to say though, that's what I want.
[02:56:27.797 --> 02:56:28.437]  I didn't even know that.
[02:56:28.937 --> 02:56:32.758]  We help Spurry to do the things you do, and you've reached so many people that are so influential now, Mr. Snyder.
[02:56:32.958 --> 02:56:37.580]  But that was my goal, is to get other men and women that love liberty to take action, and it's happening.
[02:56:37.800 --> 02:56:40.601]  Look how many new great minds there are in the fight every week.
[02:56:41.121 --> 02:56:42.582]  I can't even keep track of all these great people.
[02:56:42.822 --> 02:56:46.043]  And a lot of them get butt hurt if they email me or call, and I can't call them back and think I'm...
[02:56:46.363 --> 02:56:49.747]  You know, you don't think that, you know, their, you know, their progenitor doesn't like them.
[02:56:50.167 --> 02:56:51.889]  Believe me, we're all in this fight together.
[02:56:51.909 --> 02:56:52.990]  I mean, I felt bad.
[02:56:53.010 --> 02:57:00.138]  We have this amazing reporter we're hiring here last week, and I was so busy, so freaked out fighting the globalists with such responsibility that I wasn't even saying hi to people.
[02:57:00.378 --> 02:57:02.381]  And it's because I just get so immersed in this, folks.
[02:57:02.641 --> 02:57:04.343]  But it is the joy of battle.
[02:57:04.583 --> 02:57:05.764]  Just commit to it and go with it.
[02:57:05.784 --> 02:57:06.205]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:57:07.532 --> 02:57:08.792]  Oh, I totally agree with you, Alex.
[02:57:08.812 --> 02:57:10.593]  You know, Alex Jones is only one person.
[02:57:10.633 --> 02:57:12.054]  Michael Snyder is only one person.
[02:57:12.414 --> 02:57:13.474]  But we all have gifts.
[02:57:13.514 --> 02:57:14.574]  We all can do something.
[02:57:14.594 --> 02:57:15.815]  We're all great at something.
[02:57:15.875 --> 02:57:31.040]  And so whether it's street protests, whether it's YouTube videos, whether it's writing books, whatever it is to contribute to the fight, now's the time because we've reached the culmination of history of this fight against the New World Order and this election with Donald Trump is such a key time.
[02:57:31.494 --> 02:57:32.975]  Everyone needs to get off the sidelines.
[02:57:32.995 --> 02:57:33.095]  Sure.
[02:57:33.135 --> 02:57:33.776]  Let me ask you this.
[02:57:34.116 --> 02:57:37.519]  Why do you think they're so arrogant suddenly going on TV and going, we lie to you.
[02:57:38.620 --> 02:57:41.782]  Bring the college kids in and teach them how to lie at the State Department.
[02:57:42.042 --> 02:57:43.784]  Is that an attempt to just normalize it?
[02:57:43.824 --> 02:57:44.684]  Is that desperateness?
[02:57:44.925 --> 02:57:46.466]  Or is that the mental illness of criminality?
[02:57:47.568 --> 02:57:48.989]  Well, it really is a mental illness.
[02:57:49.069 --> 02:57:52.492]  I was around these people when I was in law school and when I was in D.C.
[02:57:52.832 --> 02:57:56.255]  and they really do believe that they are better than the rest of us.
[02:57:56.295 --> 02:57:59.617]  That they know better, the elite know better than the rest of us.
[02:58:00.058 --> 02:58:04.441]  And so, and they think, you know, they regard us as a bunch of sheep, as a bunch of children.
[02:58:04.481 --> 02:58:07.484]  And it starts with them with bodyguards and then they want to take our guns.
[02:58:07.704 --> 02:58:08.484]  No, assholes!
[02:58:08.725 --> 02:58:08.985]  No!
[02:58:09.285 --> 02:58:10.166]  You're not getting our guns!
[02:58:11.636 --> 02:58:15.777]  Yeah, and you know, and they've got control of the media.
[02:58:15.797 --> 02:58:26.981]  You know, the average American watches television approximately five hours a day, and when you add in all other electronic devices, it's about ten hours a day Americans are connected to something.
[02:58:27.401 --> 02:58:34.043]  And virtually all of that, of the news and entertainment and media that Americans consume, is controlled by the big corporations.
[02:58:34.063 --> 02:58:36.304]  That's right, there is a war in cyberspace.
[02:58:36.604 --> 02:58:40.248]  They're trying to censor us more and more because we're winning, but they've miscalculated.
[02:58:40.769 --> 02:58:42.371]  I'm telling you, the tide's turning.
[02:58:42.391 --> 02:58:46.075]  Michael Siner, do five more minutes with us, then we're going to hand the baton to the next host coming up.
[02:58:46.315 --> 02:58:48.238]  And the nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[02:58:48.498 --> 02:58:49.259]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:49.299 --> 02:58:50.100]  The war is now.
[02:58:50.200 --> 02:58:51.281]  Infowars.com.
[02:59:00.450 --> 02:59:01.812]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:59:02.092 --> 02:59:03.374]  You can't survive without it.
[02:59:03.575 --> 02:59:04.476]  But where do you get it?
[02:59:04.776 --> 02:59:10.544]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:59:10.785 --> 02:59:16.493]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.

[03:00:02.868 --> 03:00:05.609]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:06.470 --> 03:00:15.674]  You wanna stop Jeremy?
[03:00:16.415 --> 03:00:17.575]  Take action, my friend.
[03:00:19.976 --> 03:00:20.857]  Get in the fight.
[03:00:22.404 --> 03:00:27.230]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:00:27.250 --> 03:00:28.652]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:00:28.913 --> 03:00:30.054]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:30.575 --> 03:00:35.101]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:35.381 --> 03:00:37.404]  You can feel...
[03:00:39.941 --> 03:00:44.705]  The animating contest of liberty, like an earthquake, 10 on a Richter scale beneath us.
[03:00:45.786 --> 03:00:47.368]  The world's never going to be the same.
[03:00:47.868 --> 03:00:49.770]  I wanted to read this quote, just some final comments.
[03:00:49.810 --> 03:00:52.172]  Mr. Schneider, David Knight's coming up with a full roster.
[03:00:52.192 --> 03:00:56.435]  We're going to talk about, did Bill Maher just lie on TV about 1 million?
[03:00:57.276 --> 03:01:09.244]  Contribution he made, Trump anonymous, new plan, Trump economics, excuse me, and we're talking about the speech he just gave in Detroit and a lot more with David Knight.
[03:01:09.264 --> 03:01:14.027]  But first this quote that I should read more and more here on air by Teddy Roosevelt.
[03:01:14.868 --> 03:01:18.991]  It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strongman stumbles or
[03:01:20.828 --> 03:01:23.509]  And then it just goes on, because it's printed wrong.
[03:01:24.029 --> 03:01:30.770]  It's not the critic who counts, nor the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[03:01:31.230 --> 03:01:45.554]  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust, sweat, and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who does actually strive to do the deeds,
[03:01:46.534 --> 03:02:04.040]  And who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, or at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold, timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.
[03:02:04.680 --> 03:02:07.241]  And it's like, take Michael Zimmerman.
[03:02:07.261 --> 03:02:11.243]  He was up here until midnight last night putting together the two reports we shot.
[03:02:11.863 --> 03:02:14.467]  But he'll see millions of people see what he put together with myself.
[03:02:15.148 --> 03:02:18.333]  And that's what it takes, is the total commitment.
[03:02:18.353 --> 03:02:22.619]  And I'll tell you, stuff's so hot right now, I can't keep myself from working seven days a week.
[03:02:24.076 --> 03:02:27.278]  And then I catch myself sometimes like 10 or 11 working, kind of bumbling around.
[03:02:27.298 --> 03:02:28.538]  I'm like, okay, you gotta go to bed.
[03:02:28.558 --> 03:02:31.380]  And it's because this is history happening.
[03:02:31.900 --> 03:02:36.282]  Mr. Schneider, in closing, I think we are at that historical crossroads right now.
[03:02:36.842 --> 03:02:43.145]  And so it's just wonderful that we're in this fraternity, regardless of race, color, creed, religion, of being pro-human.
[03:02:43.486 --> 03:02:45.567]  Because to be anti-globalist is to be pro-human.
[03:02:45.607 --> 03:02:46.187]  Final comments.
[03:02:47.714 --> 03:02:49.175]  Oh, I totally agree with you, Alex.
[03:02:49.315 --> 03:02:55.418]  You know, if people are watching or listening today, I want them to know you were born for such a time as this.
[03:02:55.558 --> 03:03:02.142]  You know, we talk about a lot of hard things out there, bad things that are happening, and yeah, things are going to get really, really challenging already.
[03:03:02.182 --> 03:03:04.783]  We're seeing banks come apart all around the world.
[03:03:04.823 --> 03:03:07.685]  Deutsche Bank, the biggest bank in Germany, is collapsing.
[03:03:07.725 --> 03:03:13.548]  Their stock price just hit another record low, and that's going to be an event three or four times bigger than Lehman Brothers.
[03:03:14.048 --> 03:03:15.329]  And all these things are happening.
[03:03:15.349 --> 03:03:17.010]  Events are accelerating around the world.
[03:03:17.290 --> 03:03:21.413]  But now is not a time to go get a shovel and try to dig a hole and hide from the world.
[03:03:21.513 --> 03:03:26.336]  Now is a time to stand up because it's when times are the darkest that the greatest heroes are needed.
[03:03:26.496 --> 03:03:29.998]  And during the times, the times that are coming are going to be incredibly challenging.
[03:03:30.358 --> 03:03:32.560]  But it's a time for heroes.
[03:03:32.620 --> 03:03:41.065]  It's a time for people to raise up, be the people they were created to be, stand strong, make our forefathers, those who founded this country, proud.
[03:03:41.465 --> 03:03:50.976]  Stand up against this globalist scum, as Alex loves to call them, and we're going to write a chapter in American history unlike any other chapter that's ever been written.
[03:03:51.397 --> 03:04:01.389]  And so I'd encourage people, just don't rely on Alex Jones or Michael Snyder, but it's time for you to rise up, you to raise action, because we're not going to bend, we're not going to bow,
[03:04:01.869 --> 03:04:12.920]  We're not going to kneel before these globalists, but we're going to stand up, and even if some of us end up dying, we're going to stand tall.
[03:04:13.420 --> 03:04:23.930]  And people are going to look back and say, wow, that was a generation that really responded to the call and stood strong when they needed to stand strong.
[03:04:24.090 --> 03:04:25.470]  You're right, that's what Gandhi said.
[03:04:25.611 --> 03:04:29.032]  First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[03:04:29.472 --> 03:04:32.353]  We're now reaching the phase where the New York Times goes, let's just shut everybody down.
[03:04:32.853 --> 03:04:34.754]  Let's shut the web down, let's start arresting people.
[03:04:36.094 --> 03:04:37.775]  Salon says we'll just arrest Alex Jones.
[03:04:38.535 --> 03:04:40.335]  And then the next article, how pedophilia is good.
[03:04:41.116 --> 03:04:42.976]  They've run the white flag up to just everything.
[03:04:43.016 --> 03:04:46.918]  These are evil fallen people that just cozy up to every form of wickedness.
[03:04:47.238 --> 03:04:49.198]  The website is economiccollapseblog.com.
[03:04:49.218 --> 03:04:50.379]  Mr. Schneider, thank you so much.
[03:04:51.348 --> 03:04:51.949]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:05:11.223 --> 03:05:14.326]  Hillary Clinton's homebrew email server, which was used to send classified U.S.
[03:05:14.346 --> 03:05:22.813]  government information, may have led directly to the death of a scientist in Iran who provided intelligence to the U.S., as reported by Steve Watson of InfoWars.com.
[03:05:22.933 --> 03:05:29.058]  Last week, the Iranian government executed the scientist after charging him with treason for providing, quote, vital information to the enemy.
[03:05:29.179 --> 03:05:34.223]  The Iranians were apparently tipped off about the scientist's ties to the CIA thanks to Hillary's unsecure server.
[03:05:34.443 --> 03:05:43.549]  After the former Secretary of State discussed his situation in plain text email, and in response to the controversy, Senator Tom Cotton said Hillary's recklessness could have easily caused the death of the scientist.
[03:05:43.689 --> 03:05:44.289]  He said, quote,
[03:05:54.796 --> 03:06:06.082]  And remember, Hillary Clinton repeatedly lied about sending classified information over her home email server, and continued to suggest she never did such a thing, even after the FBI investigation concluded that's exactly what she did.
[03:06:06.342 --> 03:06:09.243]  And to find out more, visit InfoWars.com.
[03:06:09.303 --> 03:06:10.524]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[03:06:11.164 --> 03:06:14.266]  Hillary Clinton's homebrew email server, which was used to send classified U.S.
[03:06:14.286 --> 03:06:22.770]  government information, may have led directly to the death of a scientist in Iran who provided intelligence to the U.S., as reported by Steve Watson of InfoWars.com.

[03:06:43.618 --> 03:06:51.321]  He said, quote, that goes to show just how reckless and careless her decision was to put that kind of highly classified information on a private server.
[03:06:51.481 --> 03:06:54.402]  And I think her judgment is not suited to keep this country safe.
[03:06:54.742 --> 03:07:06.032]  And remember, Hillary Clinton repeatedly lied about sending classified information over her home email server, and continued to suggest she never did such a thing, even after the FBI investigation concluded that's exactly what she did.

[03:08:28.514 --> 03:08:30.836]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:08:31.556 --> 03:08:41.363]  Alright, David Knight is in here in the studio with me.
[03:08:41.403 --> 03:08:45.646]  He's going to start taking over in the next segment from Balance the Transmission.
[03:08:45.986 --> 03:08:47.507]  Good to be side-by-side with you, man.
[03:08:47.547 --> 03:08:48.268]  You're usually in the other studio.
[03:08:48.288 --> 03:08:48.888]  Good to be in here.
[03:08:48.908 --> 03:08:49.589]  Good to see you.
[03:08:51.015 --> 03:08:52.936]  Wow, there is so much to get into here.
[03:08:53.196 --> 03:08:58.999]  Tell folks about some of what you've got coming up today, because I was unaware of this new Bill Maher controversy during the break.
[03:08:59.039 --> 03:09:00.500]  I was checking it out, it's fascinating.
[03:09:00.760 --> 03:09:05.503]  Yeah, you know, it's interesting, Alex, when they started talking about Julian Assange coming out with Bill Maher, of course,
[03:09:06.283 --> 03:09:23.735]  The mainstream media always deflects away to another topic, and the way they deflected away this very interesting exchange was to talk about whether or not WikiLeaks was going to come after Donald Trump and reveal his income tax returns, and he said kind of jokingly, well, we're looking into it.
[03:09:23.815 --> 03:09:25.396]  And then they walked that back and they said, no.
[03:09:26.320 --> 03:09:28.542]  We encourage whistleblowers.
[03:09:28.602 --> 03:09:30.263]  We don't investigate individuals.
[03:09:30.363 --> 03:09:42.151]  But the key thing that came up after that, Alex, was the fact that he had done some research because Bill Maher starts being very aggressive with him, saying, you've got your thumb on the scale to try to get Donald Trump elected.
[03:09:42.511 --> 03:09:44.233]  And he goes, well, it's interesting.
[03:09:44.273 --> 03:09:47.515]  We looked up and we found a William Maher in L.A.
[03:09:47.615 --> 03:09:51.958]  who donated a million dollars to a Clinton-connected entity.
[03:09:52.418 --> 03:09:52.879]  Is that you?
[03:09:52.959 --> 03:09:53.499]  Did you do that?
[03:09:55.580 --> 03:09:58.921]  Well, I gave a million dollars to Obama four years ago, but that's not me.
[03:09:59.762 --> 03:10:03.043]  And if you look at it, there's only three Bill Mowers in L.A.
[03:10:04.023 --> 03:10:05.224]  And who's got that type of money?
[03:10:05.344 --> 03:10:05.984]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:10:06.064 --> 03:10:08.645]  Nobody else has that kind of money except for Bill Mowers.
[03:10:08.665 --> 03:10:10.126]  So the question is... God knows I don't.
[03:10:10.146 --> 03:10:12.286]  How much does that little piece of crap make?
[03:10:12.507 --> 03:10:15.588]  Yeah, well he just signed... Oh, it was a million dollar donation.
[03:10:16.608 --> 03:10:23.272]  He just signed a new multi-year contract that's made his net worth being in the low 20s to the high 20s and millions.
[03:10:23.332 --> 03:10:30.317]  But that's the key, is that they always deflect this away and I think we ought to start calling it the fame stream media.
[03:10:30.377 --> 03:10:36.101]  You know, we talk about the lamestream media, the mainstream media, this is the fame stream media because they're constantly going to these actors
[03:10:36.741 --> 03:10:39.163]  Who apparently, we should care what they think.
[03:10:39.423 --> 03:10:40.504]  More than anybody else.
[03:10:40.624 --> 03:10:44.148]  And we should allow them to put their thumbs on the scale.
[03:10:44.168 --> 03:10:44.868]  But it's a bad thing.
[03:10:44.888 --> 03:10:47.270]  And who he really lied to, because now even The Hill says he's been caught.
[03:10:47.290 --> 03:10:48.331]  I mean, it's him.
[03:10:48.351 --> 03:10:49.052]  You're being nice.
[03:10:49.112 --> 03:10:49.392]  It's him.
[03:10:49.412 --> 03:10:50.273]  The Hill says it's him.
[03:10:50.993 --> 03:10:52.134]  He's lying to his viewers.
[03:10:52.615 --> 03:10:53.836]  He knows it's going to come out.
[03:10:53.856 --> 03:10:54.336]  He thinks.
[03:10:54.477 --> 03:10:55.017]  He knows.
[03:10:55.097 --> 03:10:55.638]  They know.
[03:10:56.098 --> 03:10:57.900]  Maybe 10% actually read newspapers.
[03:10:57.920 --> 03:10:58.900]  That's its own propaganda.
[03:10:59.241 --> 03:11:00.242]  But it's higher level.
[03:11:01.122 --> 03:11:03.223]  Down lower, it's just all about a confidence game.
[03:11:03.263 --> 03:11:08.867]  Look, my tie is skinnier and fancier, and I look more conservative, and I have a better set.
[03:11:08.887 --> 03:11:09.607]  Yeah.
[03:11:09.807 --> 03:11:12.048]  So I'm going to tell you that you can just believe me.
[03:11:12.088 --> 03:11:12.749]  So that's fascinating.
[03:11:12.769 --> 03:11:15.310]  You're going to cover that and a lot more.
[03:11:15.330 --> 03:11:24.215]  I've got to tell you, I've got a New York Times article here I mentioned that Billy Corgan actually told me about this morning, where they actually say it's time to just start lying about Trump and just credit opposition and just shut him down.
[03:11:24.516 --> 03:11:26.197]  They're now organizing
[03:11:27.137 --> 03:11:37.592]  Engaging basically in criminal activity and now Alexa that for two years has censored all Patriot sites and says we have no traffic even though it's skyrocketing and that's to bankrupt people with advertising.
[03:11:37.632 --> 03:11:42.860]  Thank God we saw that before they did it and moved our own funding by direct sales but
[03:11:44.002 --> 03:11:46.124]  And they got the Justice Department looking, trying to shut us down for that.
[03:11:46.204 --> 03:11:47.345]  Yes, folks, what's going on?
[03:11:47.706 --> 03:12:02.720]  So, I mean, this is a war, but just the fact that they would even try this, and now Alexa is going to run this little hub thing, Amazon in your house, that tracks everything digitally going on in your home, and you're going to talk to it like it's your friend, like Siri.
[03:12:02.880 --> 03:12:04.122]  Yeah, yeah, won't that be fun?
[03:12:05.473 --> 03:12:15.984]  That's the thing that we... Bring a robot into your house that works for a big, giant, multinational corporation, like Facebook or like Amazon, and let it spy on you and the terms of service admit it's spying.
[03:12:16.305 --> 03:12:21.050]  Every day we see more information being admitted to by the large corporations that they're spying on us directly.
[03:12:22.331 --> 03:12:23.412]  They're not Apple with the phone.
[03:12:23.553 --> 03:12:23.833]  That's right.
[03:12:23.973 --> 03:12:25.254]  Or they're not Samsung with a droid.
[03:12:25.534 --> 03:12:25.815]  That's right.
[03:12:25.835 --> 03:12:28.297]  So they've got to get their little robot in.
[03:12:28.597 --> 03:12:29.818]  Oh, look, it's a good deal for you.
[03:12:29.938 --> 03:12:31.580]  Oh, look, it's pretty.
[03:12:31.600 --> 03:12:33.521]  Meanwhile, it's fine on everything you do.
[03:12:33.761 --> 03:12:37.044]  As William Benny has pointed out, it's not even the recording.
[03:12:37.244 --> 03:12:38.185]  Oh, there it is.
[03:12:38.245 --> 03:12:38.686]  Hi.
[03:12:38.726 --> 03:12:40.207]  Oh, here, I have another one.
[03:12:40.267 --> 03:12:40.567]  Oh, here.
[03:12:40.888 --> 03:12:41.288]  Oh, nothing.
[03:12:41.308 --> 03:12:41.948]  Nothing to worry about.
[03:12:41.988 --> 03:12:42.649]  Here, Mr. Gopher.
[03:12:42.869 --> 03:12:44.290]  No plastic explosives or anything.
[03:12:44.791 --> 03:12:45.391]  Yeah, there you go.
[03:12:46.232 --> 03:12:47.994]  Yeah, that's from, I'm sorry, you know what that's from?
[03:12:48.014 --> 03:12:48.314]  Caddyshack.
[03:12:48.554 --> 03:12:48.874]  Oh, yeah.
[03:12:48.914 --> 03:12:49.355]  Caddyshack.
[03:12:49.475 --> 03:12:49.935]  Your favorite.
[03:12:49.955 --> 03:12:50.296]  That's right.
[03:12:52.230 --> 03:12:56.054]  Well, you know, Alex, William Binney said, it's not even the recorded conversations.
[03:12:56.114 --> 03:12:58.576]  Of course, yeah, they are recording your conversations, they are listening to you.
[03:12:59.016 --> 03:13:00.378]  But it's the metadata that they get.
[03:13:00.758 --> 03:13:02.500]  And Alex, this all feeds into this.
[03:13:02.540 --> 03:13:10.187]  And of course, there's this, as we look at, very uncomfortable coalition going on between the large corporations.
[03:13:10.387 --> 03:13:14.071]  And by the way, this has already been done everywhere in the third world, from Burma to Mexico.
[03:13:14.091 --> 03:13:14.972]  So you know who the victims are?
[03:13:31.869 --> 03:13:42.419]  It is, all these super hard-working Mexicans you see here, forced up here, everybody goes and makes fun of them, including Hispanics, they go, oh look at the, yeah I need to water my yard, let me hire a Mexican, ho ho ho!
[03:13:42.799 --> 03:13:54.009]  That's a farmer that your granddaddy was, that's why they can fix a car, roof your house, do the plumbing, do the electricity, do all the stuff, and cook you dinner all at the same time, because they're what we used to be.
[03:13:54.690 --> 03:13:58.313]  Our farmers were just as good, or better in many cases, no matter where you were in the world.
[03:13:58.553 --> 03:14:10.358]  We've been taken out of the real world, these domesticated slobs that do little specialized jobs, and then you call a handyman to come fix something, and then make fun of them because they know how to fix something, and what they did was, my dad...
[03:14:11.294 --> 03:14:11.514]  Let's go!
[03:14:32.250 --> 03:14:33.210]  Cozumel or anywhere.
[03:14:33.250 --> 03:14:35.051]  And all those little fishermen won't even take you out fishing.
[03:14:35.071 --> 03:14:35.631]  They're all gone.
[03:14:35.671 --> 03:14:36.191]  They tell you.
[03:14:36.831 --> 03:14:38.271]  They tell you in Spanish.
[03:14:38.331 --> 03:14:39.292]  I've got family who speak Spanish.
[03:14:39.752 --> 03:14:41.312]  Buckley and others have been down there with us.
[03:14:41.332 --> 03:14:43.113]  And they're like, no, they don't let us fish anymore.
[03:14:43.153 --> 03:14:44.313]  We have to work in the tourist industry.
[03:14:44.333 --> 03:14:46.653]  And these big trawlers come by and get everything.
[03:14:46.854 --> 03:14:48.614]  The point is, this is the new world order.
[03:14:49.274 --> 03:14:52.555]  And then all these Mexicans have been kicked off their land.
[03:14:53.752 --> 03:14:58.114]  They're forced up the McIlodores in these slave factories and then they're pushed up here.
[03:14:58.174 --> 03:15:02.396]  The reason we're against them is they're being used as an economic weapon to bring us down to their level.
[03:15:02.676 --> 03:15:02.976]  That's right.
[03:15:02.996 --> 03:15:04.577]  We don't, we want them to get ahead.
[03:15:04.617 --> 03:15:05.458]  We're not out to get them.
[03:15:05.498 --> 03:15:10.160]  It's the point is the New World Order that runs the Chinese slave factories is for this.
[03:15:10.771 --> 03:15:15.894]  And what you're talking about here, in terms of putting out the small fishermen, we've already seen this happening as part of the Brexit debate.
[03:15:16.174 --> 03:15:22.918]  They were talking about the fact that English fishermen were not being allowed to fish in the North Sea, as they had done for hundreds or thousands of years.
[03:15:23.338 --> 03:15:27.980]  They were being regulated out of this by the European Commission, on which they didn't even have a seat.
[03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:28.941]  So it gets paid off by the Japanese.
[03:15:28.981 --> 03:15:29.601]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:15:29.621 --> 03:15:30.302]  They didn't have a seat.
[03:15:30.342 --> 03:15:31.742]  And so we're seeing the same thing happening here.
[03:15:31.762 --> 03:15:36.225]  Nothing against the Japanese, but they know how to pay your politicians off, get the corporate deals, and then trawl everything.
[03:15:36.545 --> 03:15:45.028]  And of course, it's a Japanese corporation that is looking at this massive eminent domain fraud that we put out one report and we're about to do another report here in Texas.
[03:15:45.048 --> 03:15:50.990]  The Texas Central Rail Project that's going to do a high-speed Japanese train running from Dallas to Houston.
[03:15:51.290 --> 03:15:53.450]  And Alex, this is the next level of this.
[03:15:53.830 --> 03:15:58.312]  They've gone in first of all... The Japanese are just masters of... their elites are of screwing everybody.
[03:15:58.632 --> 03:15:58.712]  Yeah.
[03:16:15.066 --> 03:16:15.687]  Different paths.
[03:16:15.707 --> 03:16:25.036]  They haven't even decided which path they're going to do, but they're going to go in and short-circuit all the eminent domain procedures and take both paths, take property along both paths for this private corporation.
[03:16:25.256 --> 03:16:27.058]  It just keeps growing if you don't stop it.
[03:16:27.098 --> 03:16:28.439]  Well, I'm going to let you take over.
[03:16:28.459 --> 03:16:30.441]  You've done a fabulous job.
[03:16:30.461 --> 03:16:31.883]  I want to parallel a few quotes here.
[03:16:32.303 --> 03:16:33.064]  We'll skip this break.
[03:16:33.084 --> 03:16:34.225]  You can just move over here whenever you want.
[03:16:34.626 --> 03:16:37.569]  But I'm going to read a few quotes that dovetail just what's happening in the world.
[03:16:37.589 --> 03:16:38.349]  Some of my favorite quotes.
[03:16:39.390 --> 03:16:53.018]  I was likening in the first hour, and I wanted to have this quote, didn't have it in front of me, how the elite talk about us in white papers, how they see us, and then how they build society to make us the servile, dumbed-down idiots, the evil that they call us, which is another H.G.
[03:16:53.038 --> 03:16:53.498]  Wells book.
[03:16:53.818 --> 03:16:54.999]  But this is from War of the Worlds, 1898.
[03:16:55.800 --> 03:17:06.446]  He wrote books in 1898 about atomic bombs before Max Planck's equations, because let me tell you, they roll this out a little bit later, kind of like they announced they're going to do human-animal cloning this week.
[03:17:07.409 --> 03:17:08.690]  Going on for 30 years, folks.
[03:17:09.611 --> 03:17:11.833]  I mean, I've got their formula down.
[03:17:12.694 --> 03:17:14.356]  Here's the opening paragraph of H.G.
[03:17:14.376 --> 03:17:15.216]  Wells' The War of the Worlds.
[03:17:15.997 --> 03:17:26.046]  No one would have believed in the last years of the 19th century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own.
[03:17:26.827 --> 03:17:36.551]  That as man busied themselves about their various concerns, they were scrutinized and studied by the Facebooks, the Googles, the Twitters, the spy grids in your house.
[03:17:37.132 --> 03:17:46.736]  Perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.
[03:17:47.935 --> 03:17:59.320]  With infinite complacency, men went to and fro over this globe and about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter.
[03:18:00.416 --> 03:18:13.862]  It is possible that the insofar as under the microscope do the same, no one gave a thought to the other worlds of space as sources of human danger.
[03:18:14.383 --> 03:18:20.626]  Or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon an impossible or improbable.
[03:18:21.306 --> 03:18:26.391]  It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days.
[03:18:26.991 --> 03:18:39.984]  As most terrestrial men fancied, there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves, and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise yet across the gulf of space in the minds of the psychopaths.
[03:18:40.004 --> 03:18:40.744]  This is all allegory.
[03:18:41.025 --> 03:18:43.307]  By the way, he wrote this was allegory about the elite.
[03:18:43.907 --> 03:18:45.809]  Yet across the gulfs of space.
[03:18:46.710 --> 03:18:47.190]  That's key.
[03:18:47.771 --> 03:18:54.256]  Minds that are to our own minds as ours are to those of the beast of the parish.
[03:18:54.936 --> 03:19:07.906]  Intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded this earth with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.
[03:19:08.867 --> 03:19:13.431]  And early in the 20th century came the Great Disillusionment.
[03:19:14.557 --> 03:19:24.326]  Now he wrote more than 20 books that were non-fiction and wrote in one of them, you can look it up, that this was an allegory of the elite socialist and the social Darwinist against us.
[03:19:24.406 --> 03:19:25.227]  They are the new man.
[03:19:25.667 --> 03:19:28.670]  They are the cold, calculating.
[03:19:30.191 --> 03:19:32.133]  Oh, I can understand you want to love everyone.
[03:19:32.153 --> 03:19:35.215]  We're going to kill everybody to build a utopia upon it because
[03:19:36.238 --> 03:19:56.810]  Again, that to our minds are as those of the beasts of the parish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, like a little kid they've grabbed out of your backyard as a psycho coldly lays it out and straps it down for torture and rape, regarded this earth with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.
[03:19:57.490 --> 03:20:00.912]  You know what I see in that, Alex, is an echo of the Ardilek War.
[03:20:01.172 --> 03:20:02.612]  You know, you've seen Elysium, these other things.
[03:20:02.672 --> 03:20:04.473]  I've said they're going to go out near Earth orbit.
[03:20:04.493 --> 03:20:05.893]  We've got Jeff Bezos.
[03:20:05.933 --> 03:20:08.394]  That's the sort of thing that he's been... Oh, they're telling us their plans.
[03:20:08.594 --> 03:20:09.314]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:20:09.755 --> 03:20:12.715]  And they look at this... And I guarantee you, they're going to invite us up there.
[03:20:12.856 --> 03:20:13.036]  Yeah.
[03:20:13.956 --> 03:20:18.217]  All the high technology, all the super drugs, everything, if we'll just sell everybody else out.
[03:20:18.277 --> 03:20:19.057]  That's the ticket.
[03:20:19.077 --> 03:20:19.358]  Yeah.
[03:20:19.678 --> 03:20:20.718]  You know what I'm going to say?
[03:20:22.042 --> 03:20:22.823]  Go ahead.
[03:20:22.883 --> 03:20:24.164]  They call themselves the Cosmos.
[03:20:24.445 --> 03:20:27.248]  And in that passage right there, they're talking about the Terrans.
[03:20:27.628 --> 03:20:31.212]  The higher lifeforms, the artificial intelligence.
[03:20:31.232 --> 03:20:35.858]  You know, when Hugo de Guerras started talking about that... You're right, it's the allegory of Olympus versus the commoners.
[03:20:35.878 --> 03:20:36.378]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:20:36.578 --> 03:20:37.980]  Or their artificial intelligence.
[03:20:38.020 --> 03:20:41.504]  They think that they're... But before they become gods, they must go to the golden field of Elysium.
[03:20:41.564 --> 03:20:41.744]  Yeah.
[03:20:41.944 --> 03:20:42.786]  That's the purgatory.
[03:20:42.826 --> 03:20:43.106]  Go ahead.
[03:20:43.226 --> 03:20:43.607]  Exactly.
[03:20:43.947 --> 03:20:44.748]  That's what they're looking at.
[03:20:44.808 --> 03:20:56.182]  And you know, the thing that they understand, and the thing that Hugo deGarris understands, when you start talking about the artilect war, the war of artificial intelligence, we had the elites go into near-Earth orbit.
[03:20:56.743 --> 03:20:57.964]  Well, that's in 2001.
[03:20:58.004 --> 03:21:00.207]  We must defeat that first to transcend.
[03:21:00.387 --> 03:21:00.587]  Yeah.
[03:21:00.967 --> 03:21:03.769]  Well, of course, what they're planning, Alex, is gigadeth.
[03:21:03.869 --> 03:21:05.330]  Not megadeth, but gigadeth.
[03:21:05.550 --> 03:21:05.810]  Okay?
[03:21:05.850 --> 03:21:06.730]  That's what they're looking at.
[03:21:07.050 --> 03:21:10.572]  Billions of people killed, and they do it from their remote redoubt.
[03:21:10.592 --> 03:21:11.653]  They're already planning it all.
[03:21:11.833 --> 03:21:12.213]  Exactly.
[03:21:12.413 --> 03:21:12.753]  Exactly.
[03:21:12.773 --> 03:21:19.397]  And then Trendy's sit there at the State Department making fun of us when you and your family are not going to the command base.
[03:21:20.441 --> 03:21:23.264]  I mean, very few people have been given offers to join the actual elite.
[03:21:23.665 --> 03:21:28.250]  And I just sit here, as someone who has been offered this, because they're smart folks.
[03:21:28.270 --> 03:21:29.491]  They could long-term see where I was going.
[03:21:29.852 --> 03:21:32.815]  They sit there and they literally, all these idiots serve it.
[03:21:33.155 --> 03:21:34.978]  You will never be brought up to those people.
[03:21:35.638 --> 03:21:40.441]  In fact, they see the minions that open the gate, the traitors, as the most horrible, profane people.
[03:21:41.681 --> 03:21:42.962]  The average traitor doesn't know.
[03:21:43.002 --> 03:21:44.703]  The elite see themselves as pure.
[03:21:45.063 --> 03:21:47.324]  They see the traitors as the scum of the earth.
[03:21:47.704 --> 03:21:48.965]  They see us as the white knights.
[03:21:49.305 --> 03:21:54.028]  But in their weird, luciferian religion, they think they're one level above us and are willing to do the bad things.
[03:21:54.808 --> 03:21:54.928]  H.G.
[03:21:54.948 --> 03:21:58.530]  Wells wrote, and others did, and Lord Rothschild, we're so sorry we do this.
[03:21:58.590 --> 03:21:59.591]  We know it's horrible.
[03:22:00.311 --> 03:22:02.494]  It's for the greater good, our master told us.
[03:22:02.734 --> 03:22:03.895]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:22:04.035 --> 03:22:04.976]  These are the deep secrets.
[03:22:05.197 --> 03:22:06.118]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:22:06.338 --> 03:22:07.659]  So where do you see all this going, David?
[03:22:08.520 --> 03:22:09.401]  Well, Alex, I think...
[03:22:11.292 --> 03:22:12.953]  The key is, will people wake up?
[03:22:13.133 --> 03:22:14.414]  And I don't think we've got a lot of time.
[03:22:14.534 --> 03:22:16.355]  Because they're going to shut down our transportation.
[03:22:16.655 --> 03:22:18.296]  They're moving into the final grid.
[03:22:18.416 --> 03:22:19.157]  Drudge was right.
[03:22:19.177 --> 03:22:21.438]  When Drudge was here a year ago, I'm like, really, shut it down next year?
[03:22:21.458 --> 03:22:22.359]  And it's like, it's all happening.
[03:22:22.539 --> 03:22:23.239]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:22:23.599 --> 03:22:24.540]  They're going to do it very quickly.
[03:22:24.640 --> 03:22:30.284]  I mean, you've got an article at the top of Drudge Today talking about how they're going to make it illegal to drive and drink coffee.
[03:22:30.684 --> 03:22:32.725]  That's not targeted towards coffee drinking.
[03:22:32.765 --> 03:22:35.166]  That doesn't make you a more dangerous driver.
[03:22:35.186 --> 03:22:35.947]  That's good enough for everybody.
[03:22:36.167 --> 03:22:38.189]  Yeah, they're trying to shut down driving.
[03:22:38.309 --> 03:22:39.369]  They don't want you driving.
[03:22:39.430 --> 03:22:41.191]  They want computers to control everything.
[03:22:41.251 --> 03:22:42.692]  Exactly, they're going to make it incomparable.
[03:22:42.872 --> 03:22:43.913]  And that's not the cops.
[03:22:44.293 --> 03:22:45.074]  Sure, there's bad cops.
[03:22:45.094 --> 03:22:45.514]  Screw them.
[03:22:45.734 --> 03:22:49.057]  The point is, they're not who you blame, like TSA being out of control.
[03:22:49.617 --> 03:22:51.158]  You blame the Congress that did it.
[03:22:51.699 --> 03:22:56.382]  All I'm saying is with the cops, the target is not the cop at the gas pump to pump full of lead.
[03:22:56.583 --> 03:22:58.324]  The target is the globalists.
[03:22:58.584 --> 03:22:59.144]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:22:59.605 --> 03:23:08.810]  The alliance is with the globalists like Elon Musk, who gets five billion dollars of corporate subsidy, of government subsidies, as well as exclusives on certain things.
[03:23:09.190 --> 03:23:10.611]  And look at what happened at the DNC.
[03:23:10.631 --> 03:23:11.371]  We've got Uber.
[03:23:11.752 --> 03:23:19.716]  You want to get in the DNC, you could either, if you're not a VIP, you could either hoof it for several miles through the heat, or you could get Uber to take you right to the corner.
[03:23:19.736 --> 03:23:20.557]  Which is run by Ronald Reynolds, brother.
[03:23:20.657 --> 03:23:21.197]  Exactly.
[03:23:21.437 --> 03:23:25.760]  And so what they're doing is, that's the way, that's a metaphor for the way they're going to operate in the economy.
[03:23:25.920 --> 03:23:28.683]  This is the new technocracy where they just block out whatever they want.
[03:23:28.703 --> 03:23:30.704]  Let me read two more quotes and I'm going to punch out and let you take over.
[03:23:31.265 --> 03:23:32.005]  A Tale of Two Cities.
[03:23:32.025 --> 03:23:33.126]  I think there's so many quotes I want to read.
[03:23:33.146 --> 03:23:35.448]  I read this all the time and it's just great because it says everything.
[03:23:36.709 --> 03:23:37.890]  It was the best of times.
[03:23:39.184 --> 03:23:40.265]  It was the worst of times.
[03:23:40.905 --> 03:23:42.206]  It was the Age of Wisdom.
[03:23:42.547 --> 03:23:43.828]  It was the Age of Foolishness.
[03:23:44.468 --> 03:23:45.909]  It was the Epoch of Belief.
[03:23:45.949 --> 03:23:47.831]  It was the Epoch of Incredulity.
[03:23:48.471 --> 03:23:49.652]  It was the Season of Light.
[03:23:49.732 --> 03:23:50.953]  It was the Season of Darkness.
[03:23:51.474 --> 03:23:52.415]  It was the Spring of Hope.
[03:23:52.475 --> 03:23:53.595]  It was the Winter of Despair.
[03:23:54.136 --> 03:23:55.417]  We had everything before us.
[03:23:55.877 --> 03:23:56.918]  We had nothing before us.
[03:23:57.639 --> 03:23:59.880]  We were all going direct to Heaven.
[03:23:59.920 --> 03:24:01.862]  We were all going direct the other way.
[03:24:02.022 --> 03:24:02.502]  In short,
[03:24:03.303 --> 03:24:12.188]  The period was so far like the present period that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on it being received, for good or evil.
[03:24:13.228 --> 03:24:17.032]  In the superlative degree of comparison only.
[03:24:17.712 --> 03:24:21.917]  Don't get literature like that from Charles Dickens, do you?
[03:24:22.257 --> 03:24:22.477]  No.
[03:24:22.978 --> 03:24:23.838]  No.
[03:24:23.878 --> 03:24:24.339]  Let's continue.
[03:24:24.359 --> 03:24:26.281]  You're going to hear robots writing stuff like that.
[03:24:28.183 --> 03:24:29.664]  Now let's go on to the next piece here.
[03:24:30.425 --> 03:24:33.468]  The truth is this whole attack is just to stimulate us to the next level.
[03:24:33.508 --> 03:24:35.149]  God did all this and I totally see the plan.
[03:24:35.870 --> 03:24:37.191]  Let's go ahead and go to the next piece here.
[03:24:38.072 --> 03:24:39.533]  Marcus Torelli is Cicero.
[03:24:40.194 --> 03:24:43.016]  A nation can survive its fools and even the ambitious.
[03:24:44.277 --> 03:24:44.978]  That's Donald Trump.
[03:24:45.618 --> 03:24:48.040]  But it cannot survive treason from within.
[03:24:48.060 --> 03:24:51.743]  That evil will to attack productivity.
[03:24:51.803 --> 03:24:52.904]  I'm sorry, I'm adding things.
[03:24:53.524 --> 03:24:58.588]  A nation can survive its fools and even the ambitious, but it cannot survive treason from within.
[03:25:01.323 --> 03:25:06.370]  An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly.
[03:25:06.770 --> 03:25:10.656]  But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely.
[03:25:10.676 --> 03:25:16.183]  His sly whispers rustling through all the alleyways, heard in the very halls of government.
[03:25:16.243 --> 03:25:17.463]  We're good to go.
[03:25:47.401 --> 03:25:47.821]  Powerful.
[03:25:48.121 --> 03:25:48.542]  Yeah.
[03:25:48.622 --> 03:25:49.562]  I'm going to let you take over.
[03:25:49.602 --> 03:25:50.422]  Great job, David Knight.
[03:25:50.482 --> 03:25:52.003]  Nightly News Tonight, seven o'clock central.
[03:25:52.363 --> 03:25:53.284]  In five minutes you can move over.
[03:25:53.304 --> 03:25:54.784]  Obviously we've got a break, but thank you, David.
[03:25:54.944 --> 03:25:55.405]  Please continue.
[03:25:55.685 --> 03:26:04.629]  Well, Alex, when you're reading that, the story that comes to mind is the one that broke this weekend about National Review saying that Obama violated the law with his ransom payments, okay?
[03:26:05.169 --> 03:26:08.631]  We've had a lot of ways, again, just as we saw with the Bill Maher story.
[03:26:08.771 --> 03:26:11.332]  They spend the information in particular ways.
[03:26:11.392 --> 03:26:14.974]  And what did they do when it was revealed by Wall Street Journal last Wednesday?
[03:26:15.774 --> 03:26:22.339]  That they had put pallets of foreign currency from Swiss banks and flown them secretly to Iran.
[03:26:22.359 --> 03:26:23.600]  Without congressional authorization.
[03:26:23.640 --> 03:26:24.241]  It isn't legal.
[03:26:24.701 --> 03:26:30.245]  Well, what they first did was they focused on Donald Trump saying, you can see the plane when he's talking about B-roll that's there, right?
[03:26:30.686 --> 03:26:31.627]  Whether he saw the plane or not.
[03:26:32.327 --> 03:26:33.288]  They focus on that.
[03:26:33.448 --> 03:26:36.229]  Then the next thing they come out and say, well, it's not a ransom.
[03:26:36.370 --> 03:26:37.730]  This was all planned.
[03:26:37.790 --> 03:26:45.135]  We've been talking about giving them this money back for 37 years, but it just happened to be the right timing to do it as we got these hostages released.
[03:26:45.635 --> 03:26:47.176]  That story begins to break down.
[03:26:47.256 --> 03:26:49.638]  People obviously know that this is a ransom that was paid.
[03:26:49.738 --> 03:26:51.439]  One of the hostages there, a pastor,
[03:26:52.099 --> 03:26:55.860]  That everybody had criticized when the deal was struck back in July.
[03:26:56.100 --> 03:27:02.962]  They said you couldn't even secure the release of four high-profile hostages that were held in Iran unreasonably.
[03:27:03.042 --> 03:27:05.282]  Again, this guy was arrested simply for being a Christian.
[03:27:05.763 --> 03:27:09.183]  They said you couldn't even negotiate that when you turned over so much stuff to Iran.
[03:27:09.203 --> 03:27:13.985]  So then six months later, they did get the release of these people by giving them $400 million.
[03:27:14.285 --> 03:27:18.266]  But National Review pointed out this week in Alex, and this was something that was picked up by Drudge,
[03:27:18.846 --> 03:27:21.308]  That it's about the violation of the law.
[03:27:21.868 --> 03:27:23.029]  What we've got going on here.
[03:27:23.329 --> 03:27:24.330]  Just like open borders.
[03:27:24.730 --> 03:27:25.071]  Exactly.
[03:27:25.091 --> 03:27:26.091]  Just tells us what the hell he wants.
[03:27:26.291 --> 03:27:31.615]  Well, I mean, this is like Mena, Arkansas MO that we've got going on here, okay?
[03:27:32.436 --> 03:27:36.298]  He said, at the time that he did, he said, well, you know, I just couldn't write them a check.
[03:27:36.819 --> 03:27:38.680]  Well, there's a reason he can't write them a check.
[03:27:38.860 --> 03:27:39.501]  He's got to prove.
[03:27:39.901 --> 03:27:43.724]  Well, there's all kinds of prohibitions in terms of... Sanctions.
[03:27:44.024 --> 03:27:48.607]  Sanctions and other things that make it illegal to have any financial dealings with Iran.
[03:27:48.967 --> 03:27:52.690]  And that includes using a third-party go-between.
[03:27:52.730 --> 03:27:54.431]  That is explicitly prohibited.
[03:27:54.751 --> 03:28:09.121]  So they go through and they lay out all the different things that he did in this, and the bottom line, Alex, is that there is a section of the law, 560.701, that makes it clear, willful violations of these regulations constitute a serious felony offense.
[03:28:09.801 --> 03:28:10.481]  Under federal criminal law.
[03:28:10.501 --> 03:28:11.642]  So Obama committed a felony, as usual.
[03:28:11.862 --> 03:28:12.222]  Yeah.
[03:28:12.242 --> 03:28:13.282]  20 years imprisonment.
[03:28:13.362 --> 03:28:16.263]  Just like shipping an illegal across is a felony.
[03:28:16.343 --> 03:28:17.484]  I mean, they complete the smuggling problem.
[03:28:17.504 --> 03:28:22.565]  And again, if you're going to ship a man, at least give him a TB test and then give him treatment.
[03:28:22.765 --> 03:28:23.425]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:28:23.746 --> 03:28:24.846]  But look at the money laundering.
[03:28:25.086 --> 03:28:31.068]  We're told in the war on cash that if you try to get cash out of the bank, okay, it's a crime.
[03:28:32.028 --> 03:28:34.089]  This guy they just took out, the Republican they took out.
[03:28:35.229 --> 03:28:42.672]  They couldn't get him on, what was his name, former Speaker of the House, he'd been there the longest time, Hastert.
[03:28:42.892 --> 03:28:50.494]  He was a known pedophile, but statute of limitations, unfortunately we have a statute of limitations on pedophiles, we shouldn't have one, but it had run out.
[03:28:50.534 --> 03:28:51.035]  So what did they do?
[03:28:51.055 --> 03:28:56.016]  They came after him for withdrawing his own money to pay off a blackmailer.
[03:28:56.256 --> 03:29:00.298]  So they look at the money that you put in, and they report it to the federal government.
[03:29:00.318 --> 03:29:03.659]  The money you take out, if it's cash, they report that to the federal government.
[03:29:04.159 --> 03:29:06.201]  Small amounts.
[03:29:06.221 --> 03:29:07.643]  $10,000 or more relative to this.
[03:29:07.663 --> 03:29:09.485]  This is $400 million.
[03:29:09.865 --> 03:29:14.270]  It's 40,000 times what they report on all the rest of us, okay?
[03:29:14.551 --> 03:29:22.760]  And we look at this, we look at this massive money laundering conspiracy that is a federal crime, punishable by 20 years, and of course
[03:29:23.340 --> 03:29:30.004]  Nobody's going to do anything with it, Alex, because they no longer care about our government violating these laws.
[03:29:30.024 --> 03:29:37.728]  When I was talking about Bill Maher earlier, one of the things that he said to Julian Assange is that you're putting your thumb on the scale for the only person that can keep us from being ruled
[03:29:38.328 --> 03:29:39.088]  By Donald Trump.
[03:29:39.268 --> 03:29:39.908]  That's the way they think.
[03:29:39.928 --> 03:29:41.349]  We're actually trying to elect Donald Trump.
[03:29:41.369 --> 03:29:42.429]  Yeah, that's the way they think, though.
[03:29:42.829 --> 03:29:43.710]  And the Democrats are lying.
[03:29:43.730 --> 03:29:44.270]  They're all out ruling.
[03:29:44.510 --> 03:29:46.770]  They think that the president is a dictator.
[03:29:46.850 --> 03:29:47.411]  No, they're a gang.
[03:29:47.431 --> 03:29:48.171]  They're a gang.
[03:29:48.211 --> 03:29:49.491]  David Knight, taking over after the break.
[03:29:49.531 --> 03:29:50.171]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:29:50.211 --> 03:29:52.352]  Free shipping ends today on everything in it for us.
[03:29:52.632 --> 03:29:54.393]  Soar.com, 40% off Anthroplex.
[03:29:54.653 --> 03:29:55.713]  Brain Force is selling out.
[03:29:55.993 --> 03:29:56.773]  We need the funding.
[03:29:56.793 --> 03:29:57.553]  Thank you for your support.
[03:29:57.593 --> 03:29:58.174]  I salute you.
[03:29:58.434 --> 03:29:59.114]  God bless you all.
[03:29:59.134 --> 03:29:59.934]  We'll be back with David Knight.
[03:29:59.974 --> 03:30:02.655]  On the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.595 --> 03:30:06.276]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.359 --> 03:30:12.200]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:30:12.260 --> 03:30:14.142]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:30:14.282 --> 03:30:17.084]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:30:17.184 --> 03:30:23.028]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:30:23.249 --> 03:30:30.614]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[03:30:30.754 --> 03:30:32.136]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:30:32.436 --> 03:30:39.684]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:30:39.984 --> 03:30:47.692]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:30:48.013 --> 03:30:48.974]  The general public doesn't.
[03:30:50.183 --> 03:30:52.485]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:30:54.127 --> 03:30:57.510]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:30:57.690 --> 03:31:04.176]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:31:04.416 --> 03:31:08.500]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[03:31:10.282 --> 03:31:16.443]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[03:31:16.823 --> 03:31:19.704]  Dr. Grip, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[03:31:20.064 --> 03:31:25.245]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[03:31:25.645 --> 03:31:31.626]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[03:31:31.766 --> 03:31:34.907]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[03:31:35.047 --> 03:31:36.487]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[03:31:36.707 --> 03:31:40.850]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[03:31:41.050 --> 03:31:43.912]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[03:31:43.992 --> 03:31:45.554]  It works like an antioxidant.
[03:31:45.654 --> 03:31:48.856]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[03:31:49.136 --> 03:31:51.438]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[03:31:51.718 --> 03:31:52.699]  It's in powder form.
[03:31:52.799 --> 03:31:55.481]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[03:31:55.661 --> 03:31:56.262]  I take this.
[03:31:56.382 --> 03:31:58.063]  This is the product that I take.
[03:31:58.183 --> 03:32:00.165]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[03:32:00.985 --> 03:32:01.746]  We fight the Globals.
[03:32:01.766 --> 03:32:02.666]  We fight the New World Order.

[03:32:08.829 --> 03:32:11.290]  Brain Force is here.
[03:32:11.811 --> 03:32:14.072]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:32:14.372 --> 03:32:22.176]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[03:32:22.956 --> 03:32:26.118]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[03:32:26.398 --> 03:32:26.539]  Right?
[03:32:26.559 --> 03:32:28.900]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[03:32:29.260 --> 03:32:32.763]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[03:32:32.823 --> 03:32:35.965]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[03:32:36.465 --> 03:32:41.268]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[03:32:41.809 --> 03:32:43.630]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[03:32:43.990 --> 03:32:48.413]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[03:32:48.573 --> 03:32:50.595]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[03:32:51.215 --> 03:32:52.676]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[03:32:52.816 --> 03:32:53.056]  Exactly.
[03:32:53.076 --> 03:32:56.858]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[03:32:57.378 --> 03:33:04.661]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:33:04.921 --> 03:33:07.462]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[03:33:13.624 --> 03:33:15.085]  We are on the march.
[03:33:15.465 --> 03:33:17.866]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:33:18.626 --> 03:33:22.328]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:27.822 --> 03:33:31.304]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, August 8th, 2016.
[03:33:31.404 --> 03:33:37.947]  Of course, tomorrow is the day that people in Wisconsin can declare their independence from the globalists.
[03:33:38.007 --> 03:33:41.549]  And of course, we had Paul Nalin earlier on the show with Alex Jones.
[03:33:42.310 --> 03:33:42.990]  Very important interview.
[03:33:43.010 --> 03:33:46.292]  You know, when I was listening to it, I had not heard him speak.
[03:33:46.332 --> 03:33:50.394]  I've read a lot of what he's written, and I agreed with his positions on the issues.
[03:33:50.954 --> 03:33:53.755]  But the guy is really articulate, he's well-informed, he's totally awake.
[03:33:54.355 --> 03:34:00.656]  I certainly hope that this is going to be an election that sends a message to the globalists, to Washington.
[03:34:00.676 --> 03:34:04.557]  We're going to talk about Paul Ryano, and let's talk about that first.
[03:34:04.817 --> 03:34:09.238]  You know, because we've got several different articles here about Paul Ryan.
[03:34:09.818 --> 03:34:14.740]  People who are in Wisconsin need to understand, and if you're there, make sure that your neighbors understand.
[03:34:14.760 --> 03:34:15.800]  This is an open primary.
[03:34:16.500 --> 03:34:23.365]  If you are a Democrat, if you are an independent, you can still send a message to the globalists.
[03:34:23.405 --> 03:34:24.466]  You can throw out Paul Ryan.
[03:34:24.506 --> 03:34:25.987]  He isn't somebody that we need, okay?
[03:34:27.167 --> 03:34:30.850]  Republicans and Democrats alike should be fed up with this guy.
[03:34:31.310 --> 03:34:33.472]  He has lied to his Republican constituents.
[03:34:33.872 --> 03:34:38.875]  He has told them repeatedly that he's going to do one thing and then do something completely different.
[03:34:38.915 --> 03:34:40.156]  That's been the way that he has
[03:34:43.958 --> 03:34:54.920]  You know, Paul Ryan does not want to even mention the name of his opponent, Paul Nalen.
[03:34:55.520 --> 03:34:56.541]  He doesn't want to debate him.
[03:34:56.581 --> 03:34:58.361]  He doesn't want to run any commercials against him.
[03:34:58.381 --> 03:35:01.482]  You know, when Eric Cantor did that, he lost.
[03:35:01.542 --> 03:35:06.163]  He was the number two guy in the Republican House and he lost his seat against a challenger.
[03:35:07.125 --> 03:35:10.728]  For the same reasons, because he had been somebody who had been with the Democrats.
[03:35:10.748 --> 03:35:21.158]  You know, we see all these articles coming up all the time about this low-level functionary, or this guy who was assistant to the assistant to the assistant of Jeb Bush's campaign, is now going to support Hillary Clinton.
[03:35:21.578 --> 03:35:22.099]  We knew that!
[03:35:22.979 --> 03:35:23.260]  Okay?
[03:35:23.320 --> 03:35:30.006]  We knew the guys at the top of the Republican Party were indistinguishable from the people at the top of the Democrat Party.
[03:35:30.486 --> 03:35:31.147]  We understood that.
[03:35:31.718 --> 03:35:32.979]  We know there is one party.
[03:35:33.039 --> 03:35:35.261]  It's the globalist Bankers Party, okay?
[03:35:35.281 --> 03:35:37.742]  And they've been having a big party at our expense.
[03:35:38.583 --> 03:35:39.264]  So we knew that.
[03:35:39.284 --> 03:35:40.384]  That isn't anything new.
[03:35:40.725 --> 03:35:51.392]  And yet we see all the mainstream media, we see AP, Reuters, every time somebody who has even a most tangential connection to the Republican Party
[03:35:52.653 --> 03:35:58.355]  Says they're going to say, you know, the GOP dog catcher in some rural area says, I'm going to vote for Hillary instead of Donald Trump.
[03:35:58.695 --> 03:36:02.636]  It's a top story at The Hill, at Politico, at Reuters, okay?
[03:36:02.656 --> 03:36:03.357]  They all put this up.
[03:36:03.377 --> 03:36:07.778]  The Wall Street Journal and the whole mainstream media will focus on that.
[03:36:08.118 --> 03:36:22.619]  But when you've got somebody who comes out, like Tom Tancredo, somebody himself who has run for president, a brief campaign, but he's a long-term congressman, and he has taken the trip to Wisconsin to tell people about Paul Ryanneau.
[03:36:23.360 --> 03:36:28.685]  And he says, Paul Ryan has enabled illegal immigration since the day he walked into Congress.
[03:36:28.705 --> 03:36:30.366]  That's the headline on Breitbart.
[03:36:30.627 --> 03:36:44.419]  He says, I've known Paul Ryan since the day he walked into Congress and I assure you he has never, ever, ever been supportive of any of the attempts that have been made to secure our borders or to do anything substantial about the issue of illegal immigration into the country.
[03:36:45.120 --> 03:36:49.904]  And as I said last week, Paul Ryan doesn't want people to know that there's somebody running against him.
[03:36:50.445 --> 03:37:06.059]  He doesn't want to show that difference because more than it revealing that he's got an opponent and telling people who his opponent is, if he starts to run ads against his opponent, it's going to highlight the fact that Paul Ryan
[03:37:07.220 --> 03:37:09.142]  Is against the Republican constituents.
[03:37:09.343 --> 03:37:10.544]  And he's with the globalists.
[03:37:10.824 --> 03:37:12.406]  And he's with the Chamber of Commerce.
[03:37:12.426 --> 03:37:14.127]  This is what Tancredo went on to say.
[03:37:14.708 --> 03:37:16.810]  He said, tell your constituents who you are.
[03:37:17.130 --> 03:37:20.734]  See, Paul Ryan doesn't want to tell people who Paul Nalen is.
[03:37:20.934 --> 03:37:23.056]  He doesn't want people to know who he is.
[03:37:23.337 --> 03:37:24.017]  And that's the key.
[03:37:24.658 --> 03:37:26.139]  If you know who Paul Ryan is,
[03:37:26.983 --> 03:37:34.005]  Republicans, Democrats, and Independents will reject this elitist globalist who works for the bankers.
[03:37:34.245 --> 03:37:37.426]  He says, stand up in front of your constituents, Tancredo said to Paul Ryan.
[03:37:37.466 --> 03:37:40.947]  Stand up in front of your constituents and say, look, I'm an open borders guy.
[03:37:41.367 --> 03:37:42.787]  The Chamber of Commerce believes in it.
[03:37:43.128 --> 03:37:45.228]  The Chamber of Commerce wants cheap labor.
[03:37:45.608 --> 03:37:48.009]  And I do what the Chamber of Commerce wants.
[03:37:48.109 --> 03:37:48.909]  I always have.
[03:37:49.049 --> 03:37:50.249]  I'm an establishment guy.
[03:37:50.530 --> 03:37:51.530]  He said, tell them who you are.
[03:37:52.230 --> 03:37:55.971]  Be responsible, be respectable to them, don't lie to them anymore, okay?
[03:37:56.011 --> 03:37:58.092]  He said, tell voters, I'm for the TPP.
[03:37:58.372 --> 03:38:02.954]  Even though, yeah, most of my constituents are going to get hurt by it, but the Chamber of Commerce wants that.
[03:38:03.314 --> 03:38:05.355]  So stand up, Paul, tell them the truth.
[03:38:05.935 --> 03:38:07.415]  Paul Ryan O, okay?
[03:38:07.936 --> 03:38:16.799]  He informed reporters they came to Wisconsin in order to throw the BS flag on Ryan's recent campaign that tried to misrepresent his record on immigration.
[03:38:17.759 --> 03:38:18.540]  So that's where we are.
[03:38:18.600 --> 03:38:19.540]  It's coming up tomorrow.
[03:38:19.941 --> 03:38:31.088]  And of course, when we look at what's going on with immigration, there was a story via Drudge Report, it was a Daily Caller, talking about how in Virginia, they're bringing in, of course, Kerry wanted to have this goal.
[03:38:31.128 --> 03:38:37.672]  He was bragging the last day of Ramadan to some Muslims that he was dining with on Ramadan.
[03:38:37.712 --> 03:38:43.296]  He said, we're going to bring in six times the number of people that we did last year from Syria.
[03:38:44.036 --> 03:38:44.316]  Okay.
[03:38:44.856 --> 03:38:45.817]  And they're bringing them in.
[03:38:45.857 --> 03:38:47.437]  They're bringing some of them into Virginia.
[03:38:47.477 --> 03:38:48.338]  But guess where they're putting them?
[03:38:48.758 --> 03:38:50.679]  They're not putting them in their backyard.
[03:38:50.939 --> 03:38:51.159]  Okay?
[03:38:51.179 --> 03:38:53.160]  They're not putting them in the Washington, D.C.
[03:38:53.300 --> 03:38:53.600]  area.
[03:38:54.000 --> 03:38:54.940]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:38:55.000 --> 03:38:56.461]  They're gonna stick 91% of them
[03:38:59.364 --> 03:39:09.287]  Out in the rural areas, the places where there's low income, the places where there's already higher poverty rates and no jobs, and the places where they have lower populations.
[03:39:09.347 --> 03:39:11.988]  Because folks, let's understand what's going on here.
[03:39:12.868 --> 03:39:17.330]  This is, as the German writer I pointed out last week said about Angela Merkel,
[03:39:17.890 --> 03:39:20.892]  This is the great people replacement.
[03:39:21.572 --> 03:39:27.655]  They want to replace the indigenous people in this country, and that's whether you are black, white, hispanic, or whatever.
[03:39:27.735 --> 03:39:39.100]  If you're an American who's been here, if you buy into the American ideals, they want to replace you with fresh new people that are an open slate that they can make their voters.
[03:39:39.801 --> 03:39:44.083]  You know, it was interesting when we were talking about Angela Merkel and the pushback against her.
[03:39:44.815 --> 03:39:46.896]  There was an interesting quote that I'd never seen before.
[03:39:46.956 --> 03:39:51.459]  Alex was reading a lot of quotes in the last segment about what the elites have been up to.
[03:39:51.479 --> 03:39:55.341]  It was in 1953, Bertolt Brecht was a communist.
[03:39:55.401 --> 03:39:59.684]  And, okay, occasionally communists say some really amazing things.
[03:40:00.744 --> 03:40:06.047]  Like when they say, uh, power comes out of the barrel of a gun, you know, and I'm gonna control the guns, okay?
[03:40:06.548 --> 03:40:10.070]  Bertolt Brecht was looking at what happened in Eastern Germany in 1953.
[03:40:10.150 --> 03:40:15.673]  Of course, that was when we had the Iron Curtain for those Millennials who haven't, uh, who've gone to public school.
[03:40:15.693 --> 03:40:20.456]  There was something called the Iron Curtain, where they split, uh, Germany down the middle.
[03:40:20.836 --> 03:40:23.498]  And on the Communist side, on the East German side,
[03:40:24.474 --> 03:40:26.516]  It was supposed to be a worker's paradise.
[03:40:27.176 --> 03:40:27.937]  And yet, guess what?
[03:40:28.598 --> 03:40:30.799]  They wanted a higher minimum wage.
[03:40:30.839 --> 03:40:31.780]  Does that sound familiar?
[03:40:31.800 --> 03:40:33.302]  That was a key thing.
[03:40:33.522 --> 03:40:40.628]  They had a massive demonstration saying they wanted higher minimum wages from their communist masters.
[03:40:41.288 --> 03:40:43.570]  Because they always make themselves elitists, don't they?
[03:40:44.451 --> 03:40:49.335]  You know, when communism happens, it isn't, you know, from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.
[03:40:49.776 --> 03:40:50.857]  That didn't work that way.
[03:40:51.570 --> 03:40:56.972]  You have a few elitists that get in charge and they get everything, just as we see with Kim Jong-un and the others.
[03:40:57.847 --> 03:41:03.031]  Well, what was happening in Eastern Germany, they had a massive demonstration, wanting higher wages.
[03:41:03.471 --> 03:41:09.016]  They brutally repressed that, a lot of militarized brutality against those demonstrators.
[03:41:09.376 --> 03:41:15.181]  So Bertolt Brecht became momentarily disillusioned with communism and its practical application.
[03:41:15.761 --> 03:41:21.806]  And he said, well, you know, we'd like to, many people want to dissolve the government when it doesn't suit the people.
[03:41:21.946 --> 03:41:25.629]  But the government has decided that it's easier to dissolve the people
[03:41:26.349 --> 03:41:28.190]  And to elect another.
[03:41:29.491 --> 03:41:30.912]  That's what's happening right now.
[03:41:31.733 --> 03:41:37.417]  See, the Republicans and the Democrats have decided that you're not going to mess with them in Congress.
[03:41:37.437 --> 03:41:40.439]  For the most part, they're going to do whatever they can to rig the election.
[03:41:40.939 --> 03:41:45.422]  They're going to get big bucks from their patrons to do whatever they want.
[03:41:46.403 --> 03:41:52.105]  And they think that it is easier, and this is going to be a referendum tomorrow to see which is going to be easier.
[03:41:52.265 --> 03:41:59.807]  Is it going to be easier for us to dissolve this Congress that has been taken over by the elites that works against our interests?
[03:42:00.568 --> 03:42:05.269]  Or is this Congress going to dissolve the people with open borders?
[03:42:05.669 --> 03:42:10.031]  Are they going to replace us with people who will do as they are told?
[03:42:10.391 --> 03:42:13.352]  That truly, folks, is the referendum that faces us.
[03:42:15.077 --> 03:42:17.880]  One last thing before we move on, and we're talking about these open borders.
[03:42:17.940 --> 03:42:39.680]  Again, as they pick their narrative in this back and forth with Khazir Khan, the Mr. Sharia Khan, as I call him, all the commentaries that we've seen about this, it just struck me as I was thinking about this, you know, he was interviewed even by Anderson Cooper, and if you go back a couple months, just go back to June, okay, two months ago,
[03:42:40.464 --> 03:42:41.304]  What was happening then?
[03:42:41.365 --> 03:42:50.329]  Well, there was a shooting in Orlando and you had Anderson Cooper coming after the Florida Attorney General and haranguing her because she had opposed homosexual marriage.
[03:42:50.670 --> 03:42:53.591]  Essentially trying to blame her for the shooting there, not the Muslims.
[03:42:54.612 --> 03:43:00.255]  And one of the things that he said to her was, he said, you've never even tweeted about Gay Pride Month.
[03:43:00.935 --> 03:43:03.737]  See, that's evidence of somebody who hates homosexuals.
[03:43:03.817 --> 03:43:08.899]  If you don't tweet about Gay Pride Month in a positive way, then you are responsible for their murders.
[03:43:08.979 --> 03:43:09.320]  And yet,
[03:43:10.180 --> 03:43:13.564]  Did you see him get tough when he interviewed Khazir Khan?
[03:43:13.944 --> 03:43:17.108]  Did he say anything about his supporting Sharia law?
[03:43:17.668 --> 03:43:21.112]  How he has written extensive commentaries about Sharia law?
[03:43:21.753 --> 03:43:27.780]  How he has put out literature that's been done by the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood?
[03:43:28.988 --> 03:43:33.572]  This is Sharia law that has a death penalty for homosexuals, okay?
[03:43:34.433 --> 03:43:48.364]  And yet, you'll see that Anderson Cooper and the rest of the mainstream media gives him a pass on it when they come after somebody who has opposed homosexual marriage, saying, you didn't tweet about gay pride, so you're responsible for this.
[03:43:48.824 --> 03:43:49.905]  That's what we see.
[03:43:49.945 --> 03:43:53.628]  That's the kind of double standard, just as we saw with Bill Maher.
[03:43:53.668 --> 03:43:55.590]  And I was talking about that with Alex Jones.
[03:43:56.010 --> 03:43:57.632]  It's absolutely amazing to me.
[03:43:58.843 --> 03:44:05.930]  That Bill Maher would go on, and I, quite frankly, I have a lot more confidence in Julian Assange.
[03:44:06.070 --> 03:44:15.879]  I believe that if he says that they've got a million dollar contribution to a Hillary Clinton organization that they saw in their records, and he confronted him with that, he flatly denied it.
[03:44:15.979 --> 03:44:17.420]  So we'll see how this goes.
[03:44:17.440 --> 03:44:22.165]  There's only, as we point out, there's only three Bill Maher's in LA, and one of them
[03:44:22.725 --> 03:44:23.085]  I think?
[03:44:40.155 --> 03:44:42.117]  Uh, a challenge on his own party.
[03:44:42.177 --> 03:44:47.400]  He was running for re-election as a standing president and yet he gave him a million dollars.
[03:44:48.140 --> 03:44:51.663]  Kind of makes me, kind of reminds me of something else that was in the DNC documents.
[03:44:51.683 --> 03:45:04.311]  You know, besides all the stuff about how they were rigging this for Sanders, one of the other things we saw in the DNC documents was how they had plans to reward big donors with all kinds of federal appointments or other goodies that are there, okay?
[03:45:05.383 --> 03:45:07.265]  We've seen this over and over again.
[03:45:07.305 --> 03:45:09.187]  There is a quid pro quo.
[03:45:09.307 --> 03:45:12.050]  And we've also seen some other history from Bill Maher.
[03:45:12.851 --> 03:45:19.938]  It was back in February that he was put on a list of people who had given excessive, prohibited, and impermissible contributions.
[03:45:20.558 --> 03:45:25.080]  He had donated double the maximum amount to Bernie Sanders.
[03:45:25.100 --> 03:45:30.603]  And when I looked at this, I thought, well, okay, maybe this was a sloppy record keeping on the Sanders campaign part.
[03:45:30.683 --> 03:45:35.506]  Maybe Bill Maher gave the $2,700 from him, and he gave $2,700 from his wife, and they put it down as $5,400 from Bill Maher.
[03:45:35.526 --> 03:45:36.646]  Except, Bill Maher has never been married.
[03:45:43.710 --> 03:45:46.793]  Okay, he gave $5,400 to Bernie Sanders.
[03:45:46.893 --> 03:45:53.818]  I don't know what happened with that investigation, but you know the bottom line is folks, that's what they punished Dinesh D'Souza for.
[03:45:54.419 --> 03:45:55.780]  Did Bill Maher get punished for that?
[03:45:56.320 --> 03:45:56.500]  No.
[03:45:57.021 --> 03:45:57.181]  No.
[03:45:57.921 --> 03:45:58.602]  Didn't get punished.
[03:45:59.676 --> 03:46:19.382]  Meanwhile, one of the other things that came out of this Wicked Leaks exposure from the DNC, which I think is kind of interesting, is something else we were talking about at the beginning of the program, and that is how the big corporate crony capitalists are using the government to get precisely what they want, and to shut down other industries.
[03:46:19.402 --> 03:46:26.665]  You know, it was just Friday that I was talking to someone who was part of the low-energy nuclear reaction research, also called Coal Fusion,
[03:46:27.265 --> 03:46:38.154]  He talked about how they had been shut down by the universities and military-industrial complex that did not want to see coal fusion go through because they had a vested interest in their research projects of hot fusion.
[03:46:38.814 --> 03:46:41.376]  And we see that over and over again with various industries.
[03:46:42.537 --> 03:46:45.119]  Think about the war on drugs that we've got, okay?
[03:46:45.559 --> 03:46:52.445]  Think about the fact that, you know, we used to have alcohol prohibition, but of course they worked their way, they got that repealed.
[03:46:53.430 --> 03:46:54.151]  I think it's a good thing.
[03:46:54.271 --> 03:46:55.332]  I don't like prohibition.
[03:46:55.632 --> 03:46:56.774]  I don't use marijuana.
[03:46:56.874 --> 03:46:57.875]  I don't use alcohol.
[03:46:57.915 --> 03:47:09.287]  But one of the things that Wicked League's emails exposed was the fact that the alcohol industry is waging a major campaign to lobby Washington to shut down pot.
[03:47:09.607 --> 03:47:10.608]  I mean, who would have thought, right?
[03:47:11.189 --> 03:47:15.951]  Of course, they're one of many industries that are part of this prohibition movement.
[03:47:16.471 --> 03:47:20.433]  The other ones that they mention in this Free Thought Project article is spot on.
[03:47:20.813 --> 03:47:29.857]  Police unions, private prisons, pharmaceutical corporations that don't want you using drugs that are grown like medical marijuana.
[03:47:29.877 --> 03:47:30.817]  They don't want you using that.
[03:47:30.857 --> 03:47:35.079]  They want you to get their patented drugs from Big Pharma.
[03:47:35.199 --> 03:47:37.580]  Alcohol and beer companies, that's what this article was about.
[03:47:37.620 --> 03:47:38.841]  And of course, prison guard unions.
[03:47:39.781 --> 03:47:45.625]  Police unions, prison guard unions, the people who run the private prisons because we're locking up so many people in this.
[03:47:45.705 --> 03:47:47.246]  That's what I don't want to pay for, folks.
[03:47:47.846 --> 03:47:49.127]  I don't use this stuff.
[03:47:49.167 --> 03:47:50.908]  I don't use alcohol.
[03:47:50.928 --> 03:47:51.868]  I don't use marijuana.
[03:47:51.888 --> 03:47:53.629]  But I don't want to pay to lock people up.
[03:47:54.230 --> 03:47:55.671]  But there are people who do.
[03:47:56.431 --> 03:48:00.894]  And they want to make sure that the alcohol industry sees this as competition.
[03:48:01.234 --> 03:48:03.255]  Pharmaceuticals see this as competition.
[03:48:03.575 --> 03:48:04.416]  And they shut this down.
[03:48:05.728 --> 03:48:10.231]  But we also need to look at what it has done to destroy our country.
[03:48:11.232 --> 03:48:23.802]  When I saw this article about the UN backing Obama's secret takeover of police, people on the left and the right need to understand that it was the UN that created the war on drugs.
[03:48:24.762 --> 03:48:32.949]  They came up with the blueprint, the detailed blueprint, with the four different schedules and all the drugs put into those four different schedules initially.
[03:48:33.209 --> 03:48:34.150]  They did it ten years.
[03:48:34.915 --> 03:48:37.817]  Before Richard Nixon said, we're going to have a war on drugs.
[03:48:37.837 --> 03:48:38.758]  Okay?
[03:48:39.458 --> 03:48:49.566]  So all the conservatives out there who think that the way that they're going to have a better society is to give all this power and authority to the federal government even.
[03:48:49.786 --> 03:48:52.127]  Not even local government, but to the federal government.
[03:48:52.748 --> 03:48:58.572]  Give them this hammer, give them this gun so they can beat and intimidate people and jail people into being good.
[03:48:59.813 --> 03:49:00.914]  Now that isn't the way you do it.
[03:49:01.994 --> 03:49:07.679]  And it is really sad that conservatives think that you can coerce good behavior.
[03:49:08.459 --> 03:49:09.580]  That you can coerce this.
[03:49:09.780 --> 03:49:12.803]  It's a medical, it's a psychological, it is a spiritual issue.
[03:49:13.483 --> 03:49:18.407]  Whether it is alcohol, or whether it is marijuana, or whether it is some other substance, it'll always be something.
[03:49:18.948 --> 03:49:22.431]  There'll always be something out there, because it's not the substance.
[03:49:23.311 --> 03:49:24.412]  It's the soul.
[03:49:25.475 --> 03:49:26.495]  That's where the problem is.
[03:49:27.116 --> 03:49:38.920]  But when you create prohibition, when you create prohibition like alcohol, or when you create prohibition like drugs, what you're doing is you're essentially setting up a UN takeover of our police.
[03:49:39.960 --> 03:49:43.943]  You're setting up a destruction of our constitutional government.
[03:49:43.983 --> 03:49:47.826]  They never passed a constitutional amendment to prohibit marijuana.
[03:49:48.266 --> 03:49:50.547]  They did for alcohol, because they didn't have the authority.
[03:49:51.148 --> 03:49:59.094]  And we had another constitutional amendment to take that away, but they've never done that for any of the rest of things, because they don't even care what the law is.
[03:49:59.834 --> 03:50:00.895]  They do what they wish.
[03:50:01.655 --> 03:50:08.880]  And I think that was one of the most interesting takeaways in this back and forth between Bill Maher and Julian Assange, where Bill Maher says,
[03:50:09.912 --> 03:50:12.593]  We don't want Trump ruling over us.
[03:50:13.013 --> 03:50:15.094]  In other words, they want Hillary Clinton ruling over us.
[03:50:15.394 --> 03:50:17.395]  Or they want Barack Obama ruling over us.
[03:50:17.455 --> 03:50:30.480]  I think that's one of the reasons why we see the liberals going absolutely crazy, trying to run people down with their cars, when they see a Trump sign in the House, where they vandalize houses, where they shoot people in an argument.
[03:50:30.540 --> 03:50:37.503]  Because, in their minds, what the Democrats think we're doing is electing a dictator to rule over us.
[03:50:38.507 --> 03:50:38.868]  We're good to go.
[03:50:55.430 --> 03:51:06.476]  For criminal activity, merely because they're running for president, especially when they are president, you are setting up a system that is going to rub your nose into the ground when somebody from the other side gets in.
[03:51:06.536 --> 03:51:07.736]  That's what they're deathly afraid of.
[03:51:07.996 --> 03:51:08.416]  Stay with us.
[03:51:08.677 --> 03:51:09.257]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:15.501 --> 03:51:22.946]  On July 30th, Alex Jones made a request that Donald Trump make rigged elections one of the central campaign issues.
[03:51:23.686 --> 03:51:29.029]  On August 1st, Donald Trump went on Sean Hannity and spoke with Sean about rigged elections.
[03:51:29.850 --> 03:51:36.294]  Vladimir Putin came out a few days later and spoke about how American elections have been rigged in the past.
[03:51:36.894 --> 03:51:38.495]  Here's a recap of those events.
[03:51:39.116 --> 03:51:42.158]  Mr. Trump, I'm not going to lay things out here that you don't already know.
[03:51:43.098 --> 03:51:56.026]  But I am going to ask you to seriously think about making the issue of Hillary's election fraud in the primaries one of the central issues to defeating her in November.
[03:51:56.367 --> 03:52:00.389]  And I'm telling you, November 8th, we better be careful because that election's gonna be rigged.
[03:52:00.529 --> 03:52:01.310]  First of all, it's rigged.
[03:52:01.870 --> 03:52:04.392]  And I'm afraid the election's gonna be rigged, I have to be honest.
[03:52:05.052 --> 03:52:08.834]  And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's going to be taken away from us.
[03:52:09.014 --> 03:52:12.476]  America teaches everybody how to live in, quote, democracy.
[03:52:12.996 --> 03:52:13.457]  But what?
[03:52:13.837 --> 03:52:16.798]  You actually believe that they have democratic elections there?
[03:52:17.159 --> 03:52:25.383]  If Hillary steals the nomination and then she openly is engaged in chicanery and things don't add up with Trump, you have to say it must be thrown out.
[03:52:25.883 --> 03:52:34.592]  Hillary Clinton has had every advantage, every break given to her from the very beginning by this Democratic Party.
[03:52:34.692 --> 03:52:35.613]  It has been rigged.
[03:52:35.673 --> 03:52:38.496]  The political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[03:52:39.436 --> 03:52:40.918]  Contrary to popular belief.
[03:52:41.298 --> 03:52:42.820]  Then why are they holding the primaries?
[03:52:43.812 --> 03:52:45.033]  That's a very good question.
[03:52:45.173 --> 03:52:59.421]  It is clearly the case that when given truth serum, Debbie Wasserman Schultz vastly prefers Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, obviously, and to the extent there are things that can be done institutionally and largely to facilitate that outcome, they are being done.
[03:52:59.541 --> 03:53:04.504]  When did the press see it as their role to protect the prerogative of the powerful?
[03:53:04.564 --> 03:53:05.545]  Actually, I think that's part of it.
[03:53:05.805 --> 03:53:07.146]  And we're not going to recognize
[03:53:07.526 --> 03:53:10.673]  Queen Hillary, if there's evidence of fraud, and guess what there is?
[03:53:10.933 --> 03:53:12.817]  She stole the nomination!
[03:53:13.078 --> 03:53:15.283]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[03:53:15.343 --> 03:53:16.064]  What does that mean?
[03:53:16.829 --> 03:53:18.651]  How would the party pick a new nominee?
[03:53:18.871 --> 03:53:19.792]  Today is the day!
[03:53:19.852 --> 03:53:23.395]  They're really thinking about maybe getting him off the top of the ticket.
[03:53:23.615 --> 03:53:26.317]  He now looks increasingly like the Kamikaze candidate.
[03:53:26.898 --> 03:53:29.800]  An implosion the likes of which I have never seen.
[03:53:29.820 --> 03:53:32.983]  The biggest problem we have is we have a very dishonest media.
[03:53:33.644 --> 03:53:44.333]  If Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country.
[03:53:46.115 --> 03:53:48.417]  Including in places like Texas.
[03:53:50.698 --> 03:53:51.339]  That's ridiculous.
[03:53:51.399 --> 03:53:52.399]  That doesn't make any sense.
[03:53:52.479 --> 03:53:54.361]  And I don't think anybody would take that seriously.
[03:53:55.041 --> 03:53:58.404]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars is now controlling the narrative.
[03:53:58.884 --> 03:54:04.408]  Go to InfoWars.com for more information and InfoWarsStore.com to support the fight for truth.
[03:54:19.961 --> 03:54:21.103]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:21.143 --> 03:54:21.664]  I'm David Knight.
[03:54:21.684 --> 03:54:30.941]  In this last segment, we're going to talk a little bit about what's happened at the hacking conference, the DEF CON hacking conference in Las Vegas.
[03:54:31.977 --> 03:54:33.598]  I think it's very interesting for us to understand.
[03:54:33.638 --> 03:54:36.620]  We have to get a background to understand current events.
[03:54:36.660 --> 03:54:39.922]  We have to know something about history because that tells us about human nature.
[03:54:40.222 --> 03:54:44.645]  But we also need to understand where some of this disruptive technology is taking us.
[03:54:44.665 --> 03:54:56.072]  That's one of the reasons that we talked to the gentleman from California, Brillouin Energy, talking about low energy nuclear reactions and what's commonly known as cold fusion.
[03:54:56.972 --> 03:55:00.014]  Because there is always, it's not just the technology that's there.
[03:55:00.034 --> 03:55:08.139]  The technology has an opportunity to create an alliance with these crony capitalists and the government to control you and to shut down other industries.
[03:55:08.639 --> 03:55:16.624]  One of the things that's very disruptive about coal fusion is the fact that it could really play havoc with the bankers and their petrodollar.
[03:55:16.644 --> 03:55:20.967]  It could also play havoc with the idea they're going to put the power grid that controls us.
[03:55:21.407 --> 03:55:23.889]  But there's another control grid that is on the way.
[03:55:24.549 --> 03:55:26.833]  And that is the transportation control grid.
[03:55:26.853 --> 03:55:31.660]  I want to talk about that briefly in light of the self-driving cars.
[03:55:31.700 --> 03:55:36.547]  Again, there's some more new news about that and I keep coming back to the self-driving cars because folks
[03:55:37.438 --> 03:55:41.699]  You don't really understand your freedoms until you lose them.
[03:55:42.099 --> 03:55:45.020]  We've grown up in this country with a freedom to move about.
[03:55:45.040 --> 03:55:52.843]  It was sold in the middle of the 20th century as the thing that you got out of that automobile, and yet we no longer appreciate that.
[03:55:52.883 --> 03:56:01.265]  Especially the younger people are not really, most of them are not looking at a car as something that's going to free them, because they're so caught up in the virtual world.
[03:56:02.066 --> 03:56:02.946]  And let me tell you something.
[03:56:03.755 --> 03:56:15.699]  This control grid that they're setting up with these autonomous cars, with Uber, with Tesla, with the Department of Transportation, that is going to be something that is going to tie you down worse than anything you can imagine.
[03:56:15.739 --> 03:56:20.640]  It's going to be a massive control mechanism for the police state.
[03:56:21.220 --> 03:56:26.222]  Before we get back to that, I just want to remind you that we have one last chance for free shipping.
[03:56:26.542 --> 03:56:29.163]  This is only going to go for an additional 42 hours.
[03:56:29.203 --> 03:56:30.703]  We're running that as part of our special.
[03:56:31.083 --> 03:56:32.464]  Everything at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:56:33.644 --> 03:56:36.066]  Now is the time to take advantage of free shipping.
[03:56:36.226 --> 03:56:37.748]  Only another 42 hours.
[03:56:37.788 --> 03:56:43.493]  We've had to pull pretty much all the specials, but we've pulled back one of the mega specials.
[03:56:44.194 --> 03:56:48.037]  Anthroplex is now 40% off at Infowarslife.com.
[03:56:48.497 --> 03:56:54.323]  And of course that is a way to deal with the hormone disrupting chemicals that you see in your environment all the time.
[03:56:54.403 --> 03:56:57.726]  Anthroplex was created to help fight back against that kind of attack on men.
[03:56:58.226 --> 03:57:02.128]  You can take it by itself or you can pair it with Supermail Vitality for maximum effects.
[03:57:02.508 --> 03:57:04.869]  Again, that is 40% off Anthroplex.
[03:57:05.389 --> 03:57:08.410]  And we have another special that has just come out.
[03:57:09.031 --> 03:57:12.072]  33% off the InfoWars solar base station power supply.
[03:57:12.822 --> 03:57:17.363]  Another way that you can get off the grid, that you can start to establish your energy independency.
[03:57:17.383 --> 03:57:18.664]  That's the whole thing.
[03:57:18.704 --> 03:57:20.344]  They want you on an energy grid.
[03:57:20.644 --> 03:57:22.645]  They want you on a transportation grid.
[03:57:23.125 --> 03:57:25.926]  They want to control you with their fiat currency.
[03:57:26.266 --> 03:57:28.807]  This is a way that you can start chiseling away
[03:57:29.747 --> 03:57:32.029]  For some freedom and some independence.
[03:57:32.429 --> 03:57:35.271]  33% off an InfoWars solar base station power supply.
[03:57:35.571 --> 03:57:44.177]  A great emergency backup source and a way that you can begin to kind of put your toe in the water about solar power and getting off the grid.
[03:57:44.197 --> 03:57:46.939]  That's the key thing about it, is getting off the energy grid.
[03:57:46.959 --> 03:57:48.800]  Again, that's at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:57:49.141 --> 03:57:53.003]  The 40% off AnthroPlex is also at InfoWars.com.
[03:57:53.203 --> 03:57:55.645]  And free shipping is going to end in 42 hours.
[03:57:57.106 --> 03:58:02.629]  Now, as we're talking about this control grid, I think it's kind of interesting what happened at the DEF CON Hacker Conference in Las Vegas.
[03:58:02.669 --> 03:58:09.372]  We've had, in the last couple of months, we've had a lot of different crashes with Tesla's autopilot system.
[03:58:09.872 --> 03:58:13.214]  They said, in the fatal crash, they said, no, it wasn't on autopilot.
[03:58:13.614 --> 03:58:18.077]  Now, the preliminary report has come back from the National Transportation Safety Board, said, yeah, it was.
[03:58:18.437 --> 03:58:20.478]  And it was going nine miles over the speed limit.
[03:58:20.838 --> 03:58:24.440]  But now we see, and we're going to cover this tonight on InfoWars Nightly News,
[03:58:25.120 --> 03:58:32.402]  We see that they demonstrated multiple ways at the DEF CON Hacker Conference that they could confuse and could take over autopilot.
[03:58:32.762 --> 03:58:35.983]  Because essentially what they're doing is they're reflecting their sensors back.
[03:58:36.703 --> 03:58:40.664]  And all they have to do is send it some garbage and the thing goes completely haywire.
[03:58:40.684 --> 03:58:44.365]  Do you want that driving you, driving your family down the road?
[03:58:44.665 --> 03:58:45.066]  Not me.
[03:58:45.706 --> 03:58:47.746]  Join us tonight for InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:58:47.766 --> 03:58:50.027]  We'll go into more detail with that and other stories.
[03:58:51.847 --> 03:58:53.728]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:55.350 --> 03:58:57.612]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:59:00.734 --> 03:59:09.782]  If you can't see the irony in having a gun ban enforced by men with guns, well then you fail to understand why the Second Amendment was written in the first place.
[03:59:09.842 --> 03:59:12.704]  Throughout history, only slaves are disarmed.
[03:59:12.824 --> 03:59:16.567]  A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
[03:59:16.707 --> 03:59:17.807]  The right of the people.
[03:59:17.827 --> 03:59:19.027]  The right of the people.
[03:59:19.107 --> 03:59:20.008]  The right of the people.
[03:59:20.088 --> 03:59:22.528]  To keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[03:59:22.588 --> 03:59:31.490]  For all of you actors out there who go to your red carpet events surrounded by full battle rattle swat teams while you accept your awards for your latest violent movie.
[03:59:31.810 --> 03:59:41.612]  For all you politicians who spend your nine to five days scheming up ways to take away my second amendment rights, meanwhile you have first responders on site there to protect you, I say this.
[03:59:42.012 --> 03:59:43.093]  Come and take it.
[03:59:43.273 --> 03:59:45.795]  I have a strict gun control policy.
[03:59:46.235 --> 03:59:48.857]  If there's a gun around, I want to control it.
[03:59:49.477 --> 03:59:50.178]  Clint Eastwood.
[03:59:50.398 --> 03:59:50.938]  Go ahead.
[03:59:51.959 --> 03:59:52.900]  Make my day.
[03:59:53.040 --> 03:59:57.483]  Dads demand guns because it's me that's got to get up and go check out that noise.
