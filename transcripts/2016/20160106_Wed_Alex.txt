[00:00:01.461 --> 00:00:04.075]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:16.775 --> 00:00:17.415]  Big Brother.
[00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:19.116]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:19.856 --> 00:00:20.937]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:21.597 --> 00:00:22.417]  You want answers?
[00:00:23.178 --> 00:00:25.078]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:25.098 --> 00:00:28.380]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.021]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:34.622]  This is it, boys.
[00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:37.323]  The globalist attempt to take down of America.
[00:00:37.743 --> 00:00:39.624]  And they're trying to start a civil war as well.
[00:00:40.184 --> 00:00:41.465]  There's a five-minute report.
[00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:44.066]  Obama's gun grab crosses the Rubicon.
[00:00:45.186 --> 00:00:52.233]  As one big media insider sent me an email yesterday put it, strap yourselves in, Obama is set to release hell.
[00:00:53.594 --> 00:00:55.656]  Well, you reap the wind.
[00:00:55.736 --> 00:01:02.942]  You absolutely know that in the end, tyranny will fall.
[00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:05.044]  But this is quite a time to be alive.
[00:01:05.544 --> 00:01:07.046]  This is a five minute report.
[00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.228]  We're just going to play part of it that John Bowne filed.
[00:01:09.748 --> 00:01:10.169]  Here it is.
[00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:24.368]  Obama's dictatorial national policy strategy is forming into what can only be described as a global government-coordinated subterfuge of the language of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[00:01:25.588 --> 00:01:32.512]  It wasn't the first time I had to talk to the nation in response to a mass shooting, nor would it be the last.
[00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:35.854]  Fort Hood.
[00:01:39.056 --> 00:01:39.516]  Binghamton.
[00:01:40.577 --> 00:01:40.997]  Aurora.
[00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:54.322]  Oak Creek, Newtown, the Navy Yard, Santa Barbara, Charleston, San Bernardino.
[00:01:55.586 --> 00:01:59.230]  Notice how he mentioned Fort Hood and San Bernardino.
[00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.936]  Those were actually jihads, not mass shootings by the mentally ill or even proven workplace violence.
[00:02:06.217 --> 00:02:14.965]  So it stands to reason, if a small percentage of mass shootings are already jihads, you better believe Americans are going to need to be packing heat.
[00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.742]  Of course, this is only the beginning of the propaganda on parade.
[00:02:21.962 --> 00:02:22.982]  Here's a reminder.
[00:02:23.283 --> 00:02:32.129]  A little-known decades-old anti-propaganda law known as the Smith-Munt Act was silently deep-sixed on July 2nd of 2013.
[00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:41.516]  Essentially, unlimited government propaganda can now be unleashed to control the seething grievances of the American people.
[00:02:41.676 --> 00:02:44.919]  So what is it that Obama is selling this time?
[00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.101]  Nothing less than an affront to the absolute law of the land.
[00:02:49.121 --> 00:03:02.428]  A huge swath of social security beneficiaries will become ineligible to own a firearm to protect themselves, as Obama nonchalantly placed that into the mental health aspects of Obama's executive gun control.
[00:03:02.528 --> 00:03:03.549]  Breitbart reports
[00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:23.698]  The reporting that SSA in consultation with the Department of Justice is expected to require will cover appropriate records of the approximately 75,000 people each year who have a documented mental health issue, receive disability benefits, and are unable to manage those benefits because of their mental impairment.
[00:03:23.978 --> 00:03:26.939]  Sorry Grandpa, we're turning your home into a gun-free zone.
[00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:27.740]  We're good to go.
[00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:45.693]  I think so.
[00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:28.041]  In the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, NICS, the Department of Health and Human Services expressly permits certain HIPAA-covered entities to disclose to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System the identities of individuals who are subject to a federal mental health prohibitor that disqualifies them from shipping, transporting, possessing, or receiving a firearm.
[00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:52.286]  Furthermore, among the persons subject to the federal mental health prohibitors are individuals who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution, found incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity, or otherwise have been determined by a court, board commission, or other lawful authority to be a danger to themselves or others, to lack the mental capacity to contract or manage their own affairs.
[00:04:52.686 --> 00:04:55.147]  As a result of subnormal intentions.
[00:04:55.207 --> 00:04:57.789]  There's about a minute left of this key five minute report.
[00:04:57.989 --> 00:04:59.470]  You need to get it out to everybody.
[00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.971]  It's up on Infowars.com on the front page.
[00:05:01.991 --> 00:05:04.912]  Obama's gun grab crosses the Rubicon.
[00:05:04.932 --> 00:05:06.073]  We're going to tweet it out.
[00:05:06.393 --> 00:05:09.435]  But there is a major war against the Republic now being launched.
[00:05:10.697 --> 00:05:17.203]  The Obama administration is pushing for the largest gun grab in American history.
[00:05:17.363 --> 00:05:21.286]  We're also taking steps to make the background check system more efficient.
[00:05:21.607 --> 00:05:25.330]  And we're going to bring an outdated background check system into the 21st century.
[00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.874]  Anyone critical of the government could have their Second Amendment rights taken away.
[00:05:30.194 --> 00:05:45.947]  Simply if psychologists diagnose them with what they are calling oppositional defiant disorder, which the American Psychiatric Association describes as a defiant, disobedient, and hostile behavior toward authority.
[00:05:46.187 --> 00:05:54.033]  Other measures will allow doctors to report patients to the FBI and RFID tracking with smart guns.
[00:05:54.253 --> 00:05:55.975]  We're gonna boost gun safety technology.
[00:05:56.215 --> 00:05:58.978]  We need to develop new technologies that make guns safer.
[00:05:59.438 --> 00:06:04.824]  We can set it up so you can't unlock your phone unless you got the right fingerprint.
[00:06:04.984 --> 00:06:06.386]  Why can't we do the same thing for our guns?
[00:06:06.846 --> 00:06:10.030]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.794]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:06:14.074 --> 00:06:18.899]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:19.319]  I don't know.
[00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:41.371]  BrainForce is here.
[00:06:41.551 --> 00:06:43.652]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:06:43.772 --> 00:06:48.494]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:06:48.755 --> 00:06:50.415]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[00:06:50.455 --> 00:06:51.916]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:06:52.036 --> 00:06:55.258]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:06:55.538 --> 00:06:57.339]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:58.420]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.400]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.521]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:07.144]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:16.369]  Our bloated federal government and a coterie of megacorporations are hoping that we all have the memory of a goldfish.
[00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:19.491]  We forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[00:07:19.751 --> 00:07:28.635]  Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money.
[00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:30.196]  Instead, use your gift
[00:07:30.196 --> 00:07:30.476]  I think so.
[00:07:50.498 --> 00:07:51.158]  It's so simple.
[00:07:51.358 --> 00:07:53.259]  Don't throw those gift cards away.
[00:07:53.799 --> 00:08:02.021]  Use that money to get high quality products and save 15% in the process, all the while funding the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty worldwide.
[00:08:02.201 --> 00:08:03.381]  That's a 360 win.
[00:08:03.581 --> 00:08:05.302]  Don't donate your money to the banksters.
[00:08:05.442 --> 00:08:09.723]  Visit InfowarsStore.com and help fund the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty.
[00:08:13.767 --> 00:08:15.408]  I was trained in firearms.
[00:08:16.108 --> 00:08:17.648]  I carried a concealed weapon.
[00:08:18.249 --> 00:08:24.791]  I made the determination that if somebody was going to try to take me out, I was going to take them with me.
[00:08:27.232 --> 00:08:41.117]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:47.174]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:49.417]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:53.121 --> 00:08:57.045]  They promised us over and over again Obamacare was going to be free.
[00:08:58.466 --> 00:09:00.969]  They told us over and over again nobody opened up the borders.
[00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:05.911]  They swore to us that it was a wild conspiracy theory.
[00:09:06.431 --> 00:09:08.633]  No one wanted to take any of your guns.
[00:09:09.253 --> 00:09:12.295]  Not your semi-autos, not your rifles, not your shotguns.
[00:09:12.735 --> 00:09:14.096]  No one wanted to register them.
[00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:26.145]  Obama said in more than 20 speeches that are on record that he couldn't sign executive orders to take guns because that would make him a dictator.
[00:09:29.884 --> 00:09:38.648]  But now he has come out and said he has to act because Congress won't.
[00:09:38.989 --> 00:09:59.219]  The elected representatives of this country won't pass any more gun restriction laws because they don't stop criminals, they don't keep us safe, and guns are one of the rarest forms of death in this country compared to literally more than 50 different things that kill people more often than guns.
[00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:06.563]  Depending on the World Almanac every year, guns are in the 40s or 50s or 60s as the cause of death.
[00:10:07.624 --> 00:10:09.105]  But it's spectacular.
[00:10:09.445 --> 00:10:11.526]  It's hyped up like shark attacks.
[00:10:16.989 --> 00:10:20.752]  Now, when you look at all of this,
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:39.426]  It signifies that there is going to be a larger assault on the Second Amendment coming, not just the unprecedented attack that we have just seen.
[00:10:41.687 --> 00:10:43.868]  In fact, I believe he would just come out with
[00:10:45.433 --> 00:10:57.248]  Some of their agenda via executive orders set the precedent that he could use executive orders to create law and then would come in with more restrictions in the next few months.
[00:10:57.348 --> 00:10:59.210]  That's what they said they were going to do.
[00:10:59.731 --> 00:11:04.556]  No, he dropped the hammer yesterday with seven different initiatives, three of them
[00:11:05.743 --> 00:11:07.584]  Just incredibly draconian.
[00:11:08.124 --> 00:11:15.347]  National gun registration when you buy or sell a gun or trade a gun or give a gun to a family member as a gift.
[00:11:15.687 --> 00:11:21.470]  That then means they're going to start targeting guns in your house that they claim don't have a record of providence.
[00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:28.133]  So that you basically have to show when you got them and how you got them or they can basically persecute you.
[00:11:29.795 --> 00:11:53.946]  And that's what this is, is a war on law-abiding gun owners of America, and branding it via CNN, MSNBC, The Washington Post, and all these big university heads, coming out and saying gun ownership is racist, gun ownership is evil, gun ownership is white, and if you aren't white, you shouldn't have a gun, and we should take the guns from the white people.
[00:11:55.353 --> 00:11:59.854]  That's what Michael Moore's been saying for six, seven years as the talking point.
[00:12:00.334 --> 00:12:05.636]  Now you see the talking point from professors and media heads and the entire system.
[00:12:07.996 --> 00:12:09.877]  Because that is the push.
[00:12:12.738 --> 00:12:14.118]  That is the agenda.
[00:12:18.499 --> 00:12:19.200]  Major study.
[00:12:20.101 --> 00:12:22.945]  Paul Joseph Watson's reporting on an InfoWars.com.
[00:12:23.666 --> 00:12:28.592]  Obama has issued more restrictive executive orders than past six administrations combined.
[00:12:30.094 --> 00:12:35.560]  Uses more words that create binding legal obligations such as shall and must.
[00:12:37.196 --> 00:13:05.488]  And they're now ordering the ATF, the FBI, Health and Human Services, and more than 20 other federal agencies to make their main mission demonizing, harassing, interrogating, questioning, prodding, tattling on, reporting on gun owners, pediatricians, dentists, regular general practitioners, surgeons, social workers, school counselors, OSHA,
[00:13:06.616 --> 00:13:12.340]  They're putting it all codified into regulatory action outside of law.
[00:13:13.401 --> 00:13:16.463]  So the big issue is it's an executive power grab unprecedented.
[00:13:16.844 --> 00:13:23.849]  If Congress doesn't challenge it and doesn't move to impeach Obama, it's another incredible precedent setting milestone towards total tyranny.
[00:13:26.111 --> 00:13:27.051]  Totalitarianism.
[00:13:30.474 --> 00:13:31.995]  It's national gun registration.
[00:13:32.055 --> 00:13:33.737]  It's banning the transfer of guns.
[00:13:34.873 --> 00:13:45.350]  It is putting into the instant background check, just like the no-fly list, a system where they magically won't tell you who or what agency, just say you can't own a gun.
[00:13:46.846 --> 00:13:51.347]  It takes everything they've done in California as a beta test and takes it nationwide.
[00:13:51.627 --> 00:13:59.249]  And that's what Bloomberg admitted he's been doing, spending hundreds of millions of dollars of his own money and Soros money to get this done.
[00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:12.012]  Wicked, evil, billionaire, insiders, war criminals like Soros, openly running the White House, openly lobbying to take our firearms.
[00:14:13.993 --> 00:14:15.053]  And we've got Obama.
[00:14:17.176 --> 00:14:26.039]  In what people say is fake crying, certainly looks fake to me, up there mentioning this long list of shootings.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.242]  As if each time it's a drumbeat and how much more will we put up with?
[00:14:32.982 --> 00:14:38.444]  One of our graphics guys Zimmerman put together a satirical piece that supposedly shows the teleprompter.
[00:14:38.644 --> 00:14:42.546]  We'll roll that in front of the screen for TV viewers so they can get a full view of it.
[00:14:43.615 --> 00:14:48.345]  That has a bird's eye view of the teleprompter telling Obama when to cry, at what point.
[00:14:49.517 --> 00:14:51.818]  You know, with John Boehner, all the crying is mental illness.
[00:14:51.858 --> 00:14:58.602]  With Obama, the rare show of emotion is pure, unmitigated, unadulterated theater.
[00:14:58.822 --> 00:15:01.063]  You can even see there's no real tears there.
[00:15:01.424 --> 00:15:11.229]  And he put something in his eye, probably pepper or something, cayenne pepper or some oil, to then cause the eye to tear.
[00:15:11.609 --> 00:15:14.111]  This is something they do in Hollywood theater.
[00:15:15.816 --> 00:15:20.522]  He puts it in his eye, and then 20 seconds later, a tear comes out.
[00:15:21.604 --> 00:15:25.188]  And it's not the tear that wells up and bulges at the end and then comes down.
[00:15:25.248 --> 00:15:26.990]  It just kind of oozes out of the eye.
[00:15:27.311 --> 00:15:28.412]  That's what Pepper does.
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.462]  And by the way, I've been in films, I've been in movies, I've been in theater.
[00:15:33.282 --> 00:15:34.663]  If you haven't been in it, you don't know.
[00:15:34.923 --> 00:15:41.187]  When you look at tears, when you look at Hollywood tears, you can tell when it's a really good actor thinking of their dead mother or father or dead child.
[00:15:41.467 --> 00:15:43.649]  They swell up, they break down, it gushes out.
[00:15:43.949 --> 00:15:44.469]  It's real.
[00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.251]  But still, they're remembering something painful to do it.
[00:15:47.611 --> 00:15:52.154]  In most movies, it's fake and it's smeared everywhere because it's not real.
[00:15:52.374 --> 00:15:55.196]  Just like wrestlers with razor blades cutting themselves.
[00:15:55.836 --> 00:15:56.637]  It's fake.
[00:15:59.591 --> 00:16:00.592]  So here's the big news.
[00:16:01.232 --> 00:16:05.056]  The open, unconstitutional, dictatorial assault is here.
[00:16:05.136 --> 00:16:10.300]  Everything we've seen has been forms of tyranny as they turn the heat up.
[00:16:11.701 --> 00:16:15.384]  But now, it is just completely naked.
[00:16:15.844 --> 00:16:19.948]  Time Magazine banning gun sales to people on no-fly lists may not be constitutional.
[00:16:19.988 --> 00:16:28.235]  Experts say they put millions of people on some magic no-fly list or watch list, totally extrajudicial,
[00:16:29.329 --> 00:16:30.630]  Just like these executive orders.
[00:16:31.551 --> 00:16:32.431]  Extra legislative.
[00:16:34.913 --> 00:16:38.355]  And then they say, oh, we're going to apply this to your guns.
[00:16:38.775 --> 00:16:41.257]  The TSA model is the model to break America.
[00:16:42.378 --> 00:16:51.024]  Not the TSA themselves, but the system of the Fed seizing transportation and now saying the IRS won't let you leave the country if they have you under investigation.
[00:16:51.084 --> 00:16:52.025]  No judge, no jury.
[00:16:53.225 --> 00:16:53.986]  No judge's order.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.741]  And now we're going to apply that to gun owners and just magically put you on a list.
[00:17:00.821 --> 00:17:03.282]  And in his speech in press conference, we're going to play the clip.
[00:17:04.262 --> 00:17:05.262]  What did Obama say?
[00:17:09.964 --> 00:17:15.265]  He said that he's a constitutional lawyer.
[00:17:16.348 --> 00:17:17.949]  And he knows how this stuff works.
[00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:19.470]  And he's taught law.
[00:17:20.151 --> 00:17:26.015]  And, you know, if they can have checkpoints at the airport searching you, well, we can do something to gun owners.
[00:17:26.175 --> 00:17:27.036]  And that's what he's saying.
[00:17:27.056 --> 00:17:42.647]  They're going to take that extrajudicial federal global power grab, internal checkpoints, an internal no-travel list, directly out of Nazi Germany, where you're on a list, let me see your papers, oh, you're not allowed to travel, you've got to go to the ghetto, and then next we're coming to pick you up there.
[00:17:44.428 --> 00:17:47.349]  This is just unbelievable.
[00:17:47.729 --> 00:17:48.969]  Here's a clip from the press conference.
[00:17:48.989 --> 00:17:52.150]  I want to be absolutely clear at the start.
[00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:54.891]  I've said this over and over again.
[00:17:56.632 --> 00:17:58.032]  This also becomes routine.
[00:17:58.932 --> 00:18:01.913]  There's a ritual about this whole thing that I have to do.
[00:18:01.933 --> 00:18:05.474]  I believe in the Second Amendment.
[00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:08.095]  It's there written on the paper.
[00:18:10.576 --> 00:18:14.177]  It guarantees a right to bear arms.
[00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:24.474]  No matter how many times people try to twist my words around, I taught constitutional law.
[00:18:24.814 --> 00:18:25.894]  I know a little about this.
[00:18:28.196 --> 00:18:33.778]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the sickest joke of all.
[00:18:33.818 --> 00:18:39.581]  This is the guy that signed the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act, on January 31st.
[00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:40.281]  What was it, 2012?
[00:18:44.636 --> 00:18:45.216]  Was it 11?
[00:18:45.617 --> 00:18:52.542]  To secretly kill Americans anywhere in the world, including here in America, torture people, disappear them, have renditions, you name it.
[00:18:57.106 --> 00:19:04.492]  And now he says he can just sign executive orders and bypass Congress because he taught constitutional law.
[00:19:05.916 --> 00:19:23.921]  When he's shutting down our power plants, ordering the Border Patrol to complete the smuggling process and commit felonies, shipping guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment, giving Stinger missiles to Al-Qaeda, who are now saying they have them in the news today, that's coming up, bringing in the radicals to attack us, and then taking our rights when we do get attacked.
[00:19:26.212 --> 00:19:27.192]  I'm going to skip this network break.
[00:19:27.212 --> 00:19:28.053]  This is just too important.
[00:19:28.393 --> 00:19:29.993]  I'm going to sacrifice it for the Second Amendment.
[00:19:30.353 --> 00:19:31.154]  It's just too important.
[00:19:31.874 --> 00:19:35.315]  Let's go back to the clip of President Obama.
[00:19:35.335 --> 00:19:35.655]  Here it is.
[00:19:46.893 --> 00:19:50.156]  He persecutes the press, has the IRS going after Christians and gun owners.
[00:19:50.596 --> 00:19:51.336]  Super persecution.
[00:19:51.376 --> 00:19:56.040]  But I also believe that we can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.102]  Oh, consistent with it, like Chicago and New York are total bans.
[00:19:59.122 --> 00:20:00.463]  Except for you and your crushed friends.
[00:20:00.483 --> 00:20:03.005]  We all believe in the First Amendment.
[00:20:03.445 --> 00:20:03.905]  What's your savaging?
[00:20:03.925 --> 00:20:05.566]  The guarantee of free speech.
[00:20:07.348 --> 00:20:12.291]  But we accept that you can't yell fire in a theater.
[00:20:13.352 --> 00:20:14.052]  We understand.
[00:20:14.072 --> 00:20:15.754]  You can't bring in ISIS people to America.
[00:20:17.065 --> 00:20:24.508]  Constraints on our freedom in order to protect innocent people.
[00:20:24.528 --> 00:20:25.848]  And I know there will always be another shooting.
[00:20:26.429 --> 00:20:27.949]  We share a shared privacy.
[00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:29.230]  This is the registration.
[00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:34.172]  Or we accept that you have to go through metal detectors before being allowed to board a plane.
[00:20:34.452 --> 00:20:35.532]  And then naked body scanners.
[00:20:35.552 --> 00:20:36.433]  Not because people like doing that.
[00:20:36.453 --> 00:20:37.573]  And then have your children groped.
[00:20:40.414 --> 00:20:42.075]  But we understand that that's
[00:20:43.183 --> 00:20:45.805]  Part of the price of living in a civilized society.
[00:20:46.006 --> 00:20:59.157]  Oh, not a free country, but a civilized society where the borders are open and you bring in all the people from all over the world and don't even check their passports when they fly into JFK from Mexico, Russia, China, you name it.
[00:20:59.177 --> 00:21:02.921]  10,000 Chinese women a week land in America to have their babies for free.
[00:21:03.201 --> 00:21:04.322]  We're a total joke.
[00:21:04.822 --> 00:21:05.903]  We're a total joke.
[00:21:06.684 --> 00:21:11.248]  And then you say, but we know for civilization we gotta go through the naked body scanners.
[00:21:11.268 --> 00:21:14.551]  By the way, father upset over TSA pat down of his girl 10.
[00:21:14.611 --> 00:21:18.554]  Yeah, they're not supposed to do that to children under federal law, but they do it.
[00:21:19.955 --> 00:21:21.156]  And let's show that article again.
[00:21:21.817 --> 00:21:24.078]  That's New York Daily News they just put on screen.
[00:21:24.979 --> 00:21:26.581]  This is just two weeks ago.
[00:21:26.661 --> 00:21:30.764]  150 on flight from Mexico allowed to skip customs, leave JFK Airport.
[00:21:30.804 --> 00:21:31.725]  Just walk on through.
[00:21:34.548 --> 00:21:36.709]  Okay, but then don't make me do it either.
[00:21:37.009 --> 00:21:38.610]  Oh, excuse me, Mr. Jones.
[00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:43.393]  We're going to give Stinger missiles and TEL missiles to al-Qaeda and ISIS and al-Nusra.
[00:21:44.594 --> 00:21:46.935]  And we're going to bring them in unvetted out of Europe en masse.
[00:21:46.955 --> 00:21:48.536]  And we're going to let them just disappear.
[00:21:48.976 --> 00:21:50.697]  And not even tell governors where we're putting them.
[00:21:51.277 --> 00:21:52.298]  And it's not an issue.
[00:21:53.158 --> 00:21:54.359]  We're going to leave the borders open.
[00:21:56.084 --> 00:22:00.726]  But we're gonna put gun owners on no-fly, no-gun-buy list whenever we feel like it.
[00:22:01.287 --> 00:22:03.107]  And we don't need Congress to pass a law.
[00:22:03.388 --> 00:22:04.648]  We're just gonna do it.
[00:22:05.929 --> 00:22:07.970]  And we got local police that have been federalized.
[00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:14.553]  They're part of these task forces run by the UN, the Strong Cities Initiative.
[00:22:15.613 --> 00:22:19.575]  You can't make this up, that are going to come and confiscate your guns.
[00:22:20.356 --> 00:22:22.817]  And then you sue them, they'll just use taxpayer money to fight it.
[00:22:24.346 --> 00:22:26.892]  That's the LA model.
[00:22:26.932 --> 00:22:28.316]  That's the New York City model.
[00:22:28.617 --> 00:22:30.381]  That's what they're doing.
[00:22:31.348 --> 00:22:35.772]  Creating a whole new political persecution arm of gun owners.
[00:22:36.392 --> 00:22:38.394]  And the answer is Open Carry Nationwide.
[00:22:38.694 --> 00:22:41.216]  The answer is passing laws for Open Carry Nationwide.
[00:22:41.476 --> 00:22:50.083]  The answer is taking all these brainwashed fascists who think they're liberal out to teach them what true Thomas Jefferson liberalism is.
[00:22:50.484 --> 00:22:54.407]  Defending themselves, being independent, and having a right to defend yourself.
[00:22:54.987 --> 00:22:58.390]  You know, the greatest hypocrisy here is they're coming for our guns to enslave us.
[00:22:58.410 --> 00:22:58.971]  They admit that.
[00:22:59.847 --> 00:23:02.989]  And they lied and said they'd never come after our guns, which they're constantly doing.
[00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:09.713]  Now we're conspiracy theorists in hundreds of articles with my name in just the last few years.
[00:23:10.273 --> 00:23:15.036]  Hundreds of articles saying Jones is insane, he believes they want to take semi-automatics.
[00:23:15.256 --> 00:23:16.737]  They admit that's their goal.
[00:23:17.238 --> 00:23:24.382]  The mayor pro tem in Austin, Mike Martinez, two years ago, they were having an anti-gun event
[00:23:26.806 --> 00:23:31.971]  And there was a sign there saying, registration leads to confiscation.
[00:23:32.732 --> 00:23:35.414]  There was another sign saying, stop gun confiscation.
[00:23:35.695 --> 00:23:36.375]  I know the fella.
[00:23:36.595 --> 00:23:38.537]  He's been out there for 22 years at rallies.
[00:23:38.577 --> 00:23:44.964]  Before I was on air, when I was on gun rallies, I would see that guy with a stop sign that says, stop gun confiscation.
[00:23:46.145 --> 00:23:47.966]  And Mike Martinez looks right at him and says,
[00:23:49.016 --> 00:23:53.499]  Brother, we're not going to confiscate him with this new law that we're trying to pass in Texas, Bloomberg.
[00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:55.540]  It's part of the Bloomberg-Mayor deal.
[00:23:56.321 --> 00:23:58.642]  He goes, but as soon as we get him registered, we are.
[00:23:59.062 --> 00:23:59.983]  And he laughed at him.
[00:24:02.104 --> 00:24:03.685]  You talk about slimy.
[00:24:03.705 --> 00:24:05.046]  You talk about evil.
[00:24:05.246 --> 00:24:07.088]  You talk about sneaking around.
[00:24:07.868 --> 00:24:10.690]  You talk about wanting to have his will with the people of Austin.
[00:24:12.421 --> 00:24:21.429]  He wants us to live just like the poor people in Mexico, where the tiny elite all have armed guards and special gun permits, and everybody else can't own guns, and you've got the highest crime rate in the world.
[00:24:21.709 --> 00:24:27.174]  He wants you to be his peons, his slaves, out there on his plantation!
[00:24:28.416 --> 00:24:29.416]  Steppin' and fetchin'!
[00:24:29.916 --> 00:24:31.157]  And that's what all these elites are.
[00:24:31.177 --> 00:24:33.037]  I don't care if they're black, white, Hispanic.
[00:24:33.257 --> 00:24:36.138]  They all get into recreating slavery in America.
[00:24:36.358 --> 00:24:41.559]  And let me tell you, the number one mark of a free person is they have a right to free speech, and that's under attack.
[00:24:42.119 --> 00:24:49.441]  And the number two right of any free human is the right to have weapons for defense of you and your family.
[00:24:52.401 --> 00:25:01.323]  And that's the greatest hypocrisy of this mountain of hypocrisy, is that these people have their own bodyguards paid for by taxpayers.
[00:25:02.124 --> 00:25:17.728]  And when you've got mountains of fraud and just evil, like Michael Moore with his six bodyguards on average that have been arrested at airports trying to get guns through before.
[00:25:18.328 --> 00:25:19.028]  Look it up in the news.
[00:25:21.354 --> 00:25:23.998]  Imagine being that guy worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:25:26.742 --> 00:25:32.791]  Lives in big mansions with big fences around them, with guard shacks, with men with guns.
[00:25:38.288 --> 00:25:38.728]  There it is.
[00:25:38.748 --> 00:25:42.211]  AP, Moore Bodyguard arrested on gun charge.
[00:25:42.732 --> 00:25:44.013]  It's a sick joke.
[00:25:44.413 --> 00:25:45.133]  Let me tell you something.
[00:25:45.193 --> 00:25:46.715]  I've been around Michael Moore.
[00:25:47.035 --> 00:25:48.736]  I've been around Piers Morgan.
[00:25:48.996 --> 00:25:51.799]  I've been around Fareed Zarkaria when the cameras aren't on.
[00:25:53.516 --> 00:25:57.199]  And they look right at you and say you will be defeated.
[00:25:57.459 --> 00:26:03.344]  They are enemy military officers with rank, folks, and I'm not joking.
[00:26:03.604 --> 00:26:05.526]  The CIA is operating domestically.
[00:26:05.746 --> 00:26:07.027]  It's run by foreign banks.
[00:26:07.908 --> 00:26:13.993]  All the trendy outfits with little floppy hats and little kitty cat shirts are to make you not be threatened by them.
[00:26:14.253 --> 00:26:19.057]  These people, and I'm telling you, I have this from high-level sources, they hold rank in the globalist system.
[00:26:21.127 --> 00:26:25.111]  More is financed with hundreds of millions of dollars every decade to destroy America.
[00:26:25.971 --> 00:26:30.535]  Robert Rodriguez holds rank in InfraGard and Obama and the federal government.
[00:26:30.896 --> 00:26:32.157]  He goes to meetings.
[00:26:32.457 --> 00:26:37.121]  I have talked to three people that have been in them with the president and others.
[00:26:37.701 --> 00:26:43.807]  How to finance basically race war in America between Hispanics and others down the road and his entire El Rey network.
[00:26:46.203 --> 00:26:49.085]  Do you understand these people are in meetings?
[00:26:49.345 --> 00:26:55.710]  They have been given political offices and rank and high-level security cards to do whatever they want, basically.
[00:26:56.590 --> 00:27:00.813]  They are officers of the enemy takeover.
[00:27:00.893 --> 00:27:03.715]  They are known enemies of you and your family.
[00:27:06.938 --> 00:27:11.341]  These are literal collaborators, and of course the Republican leadership.
[00:27:12.637 --> 00:27:19.778]  is going along with it, because they've been told, we will arrest you, we will set you up, we will kill you if you don't go along with this.
[00:27:19.798 --> 00:27:20.838]  Do you understand?
[00:27:23.119 --> 00:27:27.300]  How many times, I'm going to try to find one of the clips of Obama say, hey, I want to restrict the guns.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.800]  I want to do it, but you can't do that outside of law in Congress.
[00:27:32.141 --> 00:27:33.061]  I'm not a dictator.
[00:27:33.761 --> 00:27:36.321]  Selling the idea, if he was a dictator, he could.
[00:27:36.801 --> 00:27:39.882]  And I remember saying over the years, I said, he's going to start doing stuff dictatorial.
[00:27:41.021 --> 00:27:49.164]  Persecuting the press, shutting off our energy, opening our borders, selectively giving waivers to his own laws like Obamacare to big corporations.
[00:27:51.265 --> 00:28:00.329]  So then shut down their competition and now they're doing it at a level never before seen in the history of this country.
[00:28:03.513 --> 00:28:04.814]  God help us is all I can say.
[00:28:05.714 --> 00:28:10.758]  And let me tell you, the one cherry on top in this whole nebula of issues
[00:28:12.731 --> 00:28:32.965]  is they want false flags and they've laid the groundwork in media, in entertainment, in culture that patriots that are promoting private property, the family, and the second amendment and pro-life are racist scum who deserve to be arrested and who are going to blow things up so they can blow things up and blame it on us and I'm telling you
[00:28:33.926 --> 00:29:00.738]  As sure as the sun came up this morning, they've got the teams on the ground, in place, waiting for the phone calls, with the trucks, loaded with the plastic explosives, to blow up federal buildings, and they're going to blame me, by name, and Matt Grudge, by name, and Rush Limbaugh, by name, and Donald Trump, by name, within 20 minutes of the bombs going off.
[00:29:01.576 --> 00:29:07.459]  Or a special ops team from Europe shooting up a school, killing a patriot, leaving them at the scene.
[00:29:12.361 --> 00:29:13.181]  I know their playbook.
[00:29:13.261 --> 00:29:14.322]  I know what they've done before.
[00:29:14.422 --> 00:29:15.722]  I know this Justice Department.
[00:29:17.283 --> 00:29:19.084]  And God help us, that's all I can tell you.
[00:29:20.384 --> 00:29:21.325]  God help us.
[00:29:22.605 --> 00:29:24.346]  This is the takeover of the Republic.
[00:29:24.406 --> 00:29:25.727]  This is the fall of the Republic.
[00:29:26.787 --> 00:29:28.888]  Now, there's going to be great resistance to this politically.
[00:29:29.388 --> 00:29:30.789]  They've bitten off more than they can chew.
[00:29:33.359 --> 00:29:34.900]  But they just list these shootings.
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.521]  Imagine they listed all the stabbings.
[00:29:37.182 --> 00:29:39.703]  You know, guys that stabbed six, seven people or whatever here and there.
[00:29:39.723 --> 00:29:41.965]  It would take them days to list all those.
[00:29:42.005 --> 00:29:42.626]  But see, it's not that.
[00:29:42.666 --> 00:29:44.787]  It's just this Chinese water torture.
[00:29:45.027 --> 00:29:46.408]  And then this shooting and that shooting.
[00:29:46.428 --> 00:29:49.030]  And then there'll always be another shooting no matter how much gun control.
[00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:51.131]  Then they answer, oh, we have a registration.
[00:29:51.512 --> 00:29:52.813]  Now we have a confiscation.
[00:29:53.473 --> 00:30:00.056]  Which is what they've done everywhere else and what they've done in cities that these dirtbag mafia criminals control.
[00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:23.073]  While President Obama attempts to enact gun control via executive action, a new Gallup poll shows that only 2% of Americans believe that guns or gun control are among the country's top problems.
[00:30:23.473 --> 00:30:29.395]  Gallup asked about 1,000 Americans in all 50 states what they thought the nation's top problems were in 2015.
[00:30:30.555 --> 00:30:36.677]  And out of 23 problems mentioned by Americans, guns, gun control ranked near the bottom at 19th.
[00:30:37.157 --> 00:30:37.937]  In comparison,
[00:30:38.337 --> 00:30:42.300]  Sixteen percent of Americans said that the government was the nation's biggest issue.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.461]  Thirteen percent said the economy.
[00:30:44.861 --> 00:30:48.304]  Eight percent said unemployment, and another eight said immigration.
[00:30:48.784 --> 00:31:03.774]  But rather than working on these hot-button issues, both President Obama and the mainstream media would rather focus on gun control, with the president even stating that he wants to, quote, make gun control part of his legacy, end quote, according to CNN.

[00:33:22.054 --> 00:33:25.037]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:25.638 --> 00:33:29.843]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:40.875 --> 00:33:41.776]  There's nowhere to run!
[00:33:43.004 --> 00:33:55.676]  Pretty much the whole planet's under the control of the private central banks that, in the last hundred years or so, took over the planet via fraudulent digital fractional reserve money they came up with.
[00:33:57.939 --> 00:34:00.401]  And they're militarily backed by the West.
[00:34:02.163 --> 00:34:08.229]  And if a country doesn't go along with the globalists, they'll go hire communists or other organizations to overthrow the country.
[00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:09.250]  I think?
[00:34:24.648 --> 00:34:26.809]  Uh, in Russia, turned out to be a Rothschild front.
[00:34:27.289 --> 00:34:37.613]  The Rothschilds sued two different newspapers a few years ago, saying it wasn't true, and then it turned out the judge said, I can't believe the Rothschilds came into court and lied to us like this.
[00:34:38.293 --> 00:34:41.034]  This suit has proven the claims of the newspaper.
[00:34:43.695 --> 00:34:48.157]  Boris Yeltsin, all those people, totally on the payroll of the Rothschilds.
[00:34:51.779 --> 00:34:52.419]  Can't make that up?
[00:34:53.746 --> 00:35:01.426]  Putin starts arresting all their people, and so they start moving NATO in, weapons in, try to overthrow the Russian country.
[00:35:04.192 --> 00:35:08.553]  Russia comes out and says the sky is blue and says that NATO is encircling it and threatening it.
[00:35:08.573 --> 00:35:13.575]  You've got NATO generals, top generals, saying we're prepared for war, we'll destroy the Russians.
[00:35:13.875 --> 00:35:16.535]  Top US generals saying body bags, let's murder Russians.
[00:35:16.915 --> 00:35:24.317]  You've got all these statements on TV by presidential candidates about bloody their nose, shoot down their planes, attack them, put an no-fly zone in.
[00:35:25.198 --> 00:35:29.559]  And Russia says it appears NATO is going into an aggressive posture.
[00:35:31.158 --> 00:35:36.323]  We need to prepare to defend ourselves and our media goes, look at the conspiracy theory of the Russians!
[00:35:37.244 --> 00:35:38.325]  How insane!
[00:35:39.955 --> 00:35:42.756]  They claim that we're a threat to them.
[00:35:43.076 --> 00:35:53.879]  Oh no, NATO just publicly financed Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra, ISIS to take over a bunch of countries and murder every Christian they can get their filthy hands on.
[00:35:54.499 --> 00:35:57.100]  Murder every Shiite they can get their filthy hands on.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.541]  Murder every Alawite they can get their filthy hands on.
[00:36:01.021 --> 00:36:06.323]  Blow up churches, chop people's heads off, blow up Roman ruins.
[00:36:07.639 --> 00:36:08.600]  They are a menace!
[00:36:09.541 --> 00:36:13.004]  And then Obama gets up on TV, and he cries!
[00:36:18.608 --> 00:36:24.714]  There's 160-something people that die in mass shootings every year!
[00:36:25.114 --> 00:36:27.176]  It's the end of the world!
[00:36:29.198 --> 00:36:31.640]  And yeah, they can personalize each man, each woman.
[00:36:34.161 --> 00:36:39.084]  Look at this poor Jewish man killed by a gun owner, and the Second Amendment in San Bernardino.
[00:36:39.424 --> 00:36:41.886]  The news said, no mention it was a jihad.
[00:36:44.707 --> 00:36:50.270]  And again, I'm against corrupt police, but the cops maybe kill 150 people a year, questionably.
[00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:55.053]  All I'm saying is, they're aborting 3, 4, 5 million people a year.
[00:36:56.656 --> 00:36:58.777]  Bad drug interactions are killing hundreds of thousands.
[00:36:58.817 --> 00:37:01.238]  Flesh-eating bacteria are killing hundreds of thousands every year.
[00:37:01.819 --> 00:37:02.699]  I mean, where's the issue?
[00:37:02.719 --> 00:37:04.320]  We got autistic kids everywhere.
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:09.683]  Like a third of the kids I see walking down the street, obviously, aren't ever going to be back home again.
[00:37:09.703 --> 00:37:14.165]  Soon it's going to be one in three kids aren't going to be able to talk.
[00:37:14.665 --> 00:37:15.625]  There's nothing going on.
[00:37:15.646 --> 00:37:19.267]  Breast cancer's up 3,000% in the U.S.
[00:37:20.608 --> 00:37:21.548]  Oh, nothing's happening.
[00:37:21.729 --> 00:37:22.489]  There's no problem.
[00:37:22.729 --> 00:37:24.130]  Glyphosate basically will give you
[00:37:25.083 --> 00:37:52.894]  cancer of the pancreas or the liver or the bladder or the kidneys faster than you can say coffin and he's up there we can't get their guns and he goes through and mentions these shootings some of them like Aurora that I mean the mainstream newspapers read like a boring supremacy his dad's the top DARPA super-secret scientist
[00:37:56.127 --> 00:38:01.952]  In the secret aircraft and space program for computer brain interfaces where they actually plug your brain in?
[00:38:03.433 --> 00:38:12.220]  And then the Sun is in a secret high-level program and they've got a top Air Force psychiatrist that's run whole bases meeting with him three, four times a week?
[00:38:13.683 --> 00:38:19.784]  And then everybody says there's a second shooter and he's in the jail saying they drugged me, they drugged me, I didn't do it!
[00:38:20.165 --> 00:38:21.725]  And that comes out in the paper!
[00:38:22.525 --> 00:38:33.488]  And we're not supposed to question that when the LAPD in the original report said Sirhan Sirhan was drugged and did not shoot RFK!
[00:38:39.649 --> 00:38:43.050]  I mean, once you see him do a few false flags, you start looking at other things, could it be?
[00:38:44.141 --> 00:38:46.424]  We know the names of the agencies.
[00:38:46.464 --> 00:38:54.172]  We know the names of the people from multiple police officer witnesses and people that survived the bombing of who was in the building for three days before they blew it up April 19th, 1995.
[00:38:58.103 --> 00:39:01.045]  We even have the receipts.
[00:39:01.185 --> 00:39:02.226]  World Net Daily got them.
[00:39:02.246 --> 00:39:03.326]  They came out in lawsuits.
[00:39:03.607 --> 00:39:06.108]  We're family members of people that died, sued.
[00:39:07.529 --> 00:39:14.874]  Where the head of the FBI hostage rescue team and others that claimed that they were in Dallas until the day of the bombing and then they came that night.
[00:39:15.574 --> 00:39:16.795]  They had been seen there.
[00:39:17.335 --> 00:39:17.956]  And guess what?
[00:39:18.036 --> 00:39:21.158]  They stayed at a La Quinta.
[00:39:23.619 --> 00:39:26.261]  We know what rooms they stayed in the week before.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.561]  We know who ran Elohim City!
[00:39:31.822 --> 00:39:33.483]  The Southern Poverty Law Center!
[00:39:37.926 --> 00:39:40.708]  Which is at a foreign intelligence agency front.
[00:39:41.889 --> 00:39:42.990]  The research points to.
[00:39:44.931 --> 00:39:46.152]  We're in trouble folks!
[00:39:46.572 --> 00:39:56.919]  The same people that just overthrew Ukraine two years ago and are starting war with Russia and blowing up power plants and cutting electricity and running around crucifying
[00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:01.011]  People that don't go along with it?
[00:40:01.691 --> 00:40:02.071]  Literally.
[00:40:05.492 --> 00:40:07.233]  They're financed by George Soros.
[00:40:08.154 --> 00:40:16.837]  The actual deputy president they put in two years ago actually gives speeches where they howl Hitler.
[00:40:18.638 --> 00:40:19.318]  But it's okay.
[00:40:19.338 --> 00:40:27.402]  Because the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, Media Matters, think it's cute and funny that they work for a known Nazi war criminal.
[00:40:28.797 --> 00:40:43.329]  Who now will probably destroy America because we're so weak, we're so pathetic, we do whatever we're told that we're gonna lay down to these people and let them run all over us because we've got TV and entertainment and live in our own little fantasy lands.
[00:40:48.274 --> 00:40:58.417]  But when they take the guns and the free speech, they're going to take your pension funds, they're going to take your social security, they're going to take everything else later.
[00:40:58.757 --> 00:41:00.757]  Remember that, if you think it's funny.
[00:41:01.217 --> 00:41:06.479]  All you collaborators, all you that went along with this, you're destroying your own future.
[00:41:07.659 --> 00:41:14.381]  You're bringing the United States of America into bondage, and yourself into bondage.
[00:41:16.513 --> 00:41:18.434]  Because you were such lazy cowards.
[00:41:21.774 --> 00:41:23.595]  So I hope you enjoy yourselves.
[00:41:23.915 --> 00:41:25.515]  I hope you're proud of yourselves.
[00:41:28.756 --> 00:41:39.419]  Now, because patriots for the last 50 years exposed this agenda and held it back and slowed it down, and the globalists admit they're 15 years behind, all over the world,
[00:41:41.229 --> 00:42:00.153]  And because the military actually sees how really evil it is behind the scenes, and even some people in federal agencies, I would have never thought this 20 years ago, they're some of the most awake people and one of the wild cards, I don't want to say ace in the hole, you would all be aces in the hole if you decided to do the right thing.
[00:42:01.014 --> 00:42:04.835]  Whether it's get info out or speak up or say no, whatever the case is.
[00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:12.673]  Aiding and abetting this system takeover is sedition against this republic.
[00:42:13.713 --> 00:42:15.154]  And it's never been more cut and dry.
[00:42:15.634 --> 00:42:22.699]  Obama is officially acting as a dictator by every constitutional yardstick.
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:34.526]  And he's been doing it, again, shutting down over a thousand power plants, selectively letting General Electric stay open to massively increase their profits while increasing power prices.
[00:42:35.612 --> 00:42:36.832]  That was one of the first big things.
[00:42:37.252 --> 00:42:47.975]  And then executive orders on the military, and executive orders on agencies outside of law, and executive orders on trade outside of law, and TPP outside of law and outside of Congress.
[00:42:50.095 --> 00:42:59.217]  And telling ICE, secretly three years ago, get rid of the borders, give them vouchers, load the illegals on buses, ship them into the U.S., call them children.
[00:43:00.779 --> 00:43:04.661]  And we just kept saying, it's lawless, it's illegal, Obamacare.
[00:43:05.301 --> 00:43:08.063]  He signed how many hundreds of changes himself?
[00:43:08.743 --> 00:43:09.524]  Signing orders?
[00:43:10.004 --> 00:43:10.504]  Memos?
[00:43:10.724 --> 00:43:15.747]  Where he takes this law that says he can do whatever he wants, and then changes that?
[00:43:21.869 --> 00:43:23.029]  There's the quote from the Hill.
[00:43:23.229 --> 00:43:24.670]  I am not a dictator, Obama says.
[00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:29.811]  I'm not a dictator, President Obama said Friday, while defending his efforts to stop the sequester.
[00:43:30.211 --> 00:43:30.851]  I'm the President.
[00:43:34.052 --> 00:43:38.253]  And he went on to say that he can't just act without Congress.
[00:43:38.493 --> 00:43:39.234]  You can read the quote.
[00:43:39.554 --> 00:43:43.875]  And now that you have the actual quote, you might just look for the quote, I'm not a dictator, and you can find it.
[00:43:45.976 --> 00:43:53.043]  Well, now, a few years later, he says, we can't wait for Congress to get in line with me on gun control.
[00:43:53.283 --> 00:43:55.606]  Boy, could you imagine a more dictatorial statement?
[00:43:58.388 --> 00:44:03.874]  Member Obama, back in 2013, April 5th, said, I'm constrained by the systems our founders put in place.
[00:44:05.155 --> 00:44:05.776]  We have the clip.
[00:44:05.796 --> 00:44:06.677]  We're going to play it in a moment.
[00:44:08.353 --> 00:44:21.468]  But first, let's hear the new Obama, being hailed the shining eyes of the liberals, the shining eyes of Gawker, the shining eyes of the Daily Beast, the shining eyes of MSNBC and Salon, saying, you know what?
[00:44:21.989 --> 00:44:23.371]  Alex Jones is dangerous.
[00:44:23.631 --> 00:44:25.814]  We ought to shut him up.
[00:44:26.074 --> 00:44:27.496]  We've got those clips and those articles.
[00:44:27.516 --> 00:44:28.377]  Now, they're like, you know what?
[00:44:29.633 --> 00:44:31.454]  Let's just disqualify Donald Trump.
[00:44:31.474 --> 00:44:31.874]  You know what?
[00:44:31.894 --> 00:44:41.140]  Let's just... It's good we're arresting the Tea Party and auditing them and putting them in jail for no reason and not letting them have 501c3s and going after gun groups and veterans groups.
[00:44:42.148 --> 00:44:43.089]  You people are racist!
[00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:45.310]  It's like saying, you're Jews in Germany!
[00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:47.251]  You deserve it!
[00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:48.452]  You're a libertarian!
[00:44:48.492 --> 00:44:49.352]  You're a Christian!
[00:44:49.512 --> 00:44:50.833]  And they're all on power trips.
[00:44:50.853 --> 00:44:55.636]  You look how soft and dumb they are, and how their unemployment's way up, how they're getting screwed.
[00:44:55.836 --> 00:45:04.841]  They're not even gonna get anything like the black uniform Nazis got for a decade before they all went straight to hell and 20 million Germans got killed.
[00:45:06.042 --> 00:45:10.164]  You don't even get the power, and you don't even get anything, but you get to sit there and
[00:45:11.371 --> 00:45:13.453]  Go along with it and love it!
[00:45:19.197 --> 00:45:26.842]  Rand Paul came out and slammed the White House for saying that the President says Donald Trump's disqualified.
[00:45:27.403 --> 00:45:29.104]  Oh, you're disqualified!
[00:45:29.644 --> 00:45:33.427]  Even Trump's rival, Rand Paul, came out and said that's very dangerous.
[00:45:33.447 --> 00:45:34.168]  Oh, of course it is!
[00:45:35.359 --> 00:45:39.402]  Quote, we can't wait for Congress to get in line with me.
[00:45:40.063 --> 00:45:43.086]  What's it called getting in line for a leader?
[00:45:45.207 --> 00:45:51.673]  Shelchescu, Mao Zedong, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, V.I.
[00:45:51.733 --> 00:45:57.097]  Lenin, Julius Caesar, Genghis Khan, Fidel Castro.
[00:45:57.358 --> 00:45:58.639]  You want me to keep going down the line here?
[00:46:01.181 --> 00:46:03.342]  And let me tell you, they write this stuff for him.
[00:46:04.042 --> 00:46:05.203]  This is meant to be naked!
[00:46:05.943 --> 00:46:07.524]  Better get in line with me!
[00:46:07.964 --> 00:46:10.685]  I'll sign any foreign treaty and keep it secret if I want!
[00:46:11.245 --> 00:46:12.726]  I'll open the border up if I want!
[00:46:12.906 --> 00:46:14.546]  I'll take your guns if I want!
[00:46:14.746 --> 00:46:20.549]  I'll persecute whistleblower media, the most liberal members of the media, exposing me for torture and war!
[00:46:21.369 --> 00:46:29.974]  I'll sign the NDAA to arrest you in the middle of the night, and put you on a plane to fly you to Romania, to torture you to death, because I'm black!
[00:46:30.354 --> 00:46:31.815]  And so it's okay!
[00:46:34.036 --> 00:46:35.417]  Political correctness.
[00:46:36.658 --> 00:46:44.262]  Like Louis Farrakhan, sitting down with him two days ago, said they put Obama in to neutralize black people and further enslave us.
[00:46:44.342 --> 00:46:46.963]  It's an incredible interview, and I'm trying to get it out by next week.
[00:46:46.983 --> 00:46:48.064]  I'm working with them on it.
[00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:50.371]  People say, Lewis Farrakhan, he's bad.
[00:46:50.471 --> 00:46:55.475]  Folks, Lewis Farrakhan, you can say what you want about him, he's one of the biggest black leaders in the world, not just America.
[00:46:56.876 --> 00:47:01.159]  People listen to him all over the world, and he's saying they're trying to stage a revolution, and he doesn't want it.
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:04.082]  And the media is coming out saying Farrakhan wants it.
[00:47:06.003 --> 00:47:08.545]  Regardless, this is good news, this is important.
[00:47:08.965 --> 00:47:10.927]  And he's got a lot of courage in the stuff he said.
[00:47:11.767 --> 00:47:15.811]  I went in there intending to do a fair report, some positive, some negative.
[00:47:16.798 --> 00:47:21.160]  But the things he said, it's like Drudge came here to say such epic things.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:21.861]  I'm just blessed.
[00:47:23.702 --> 00:47:25.743]  He said some things that are just over the top epic.
[00:47:28.304 --> 00:47:30.245]  But let's go to that clip from yesterday.
[00:47:30.545 --> 00:47:34.727]  CNN, Obama, straight face.
[00:47:34.807 --> 00:47:35.848]  And where's the outcry?
[00:47:37.089 --> 00:47:39.270]  Congress isn't getting in line with me.
[00:47:43.499 --> 00:47:52.633]  Hitler, until World War II was going, didn't go to the Reichstag, the Bundestag, and sit up there and say, you will get in line with me.
[00:47:52.673 --> 00:47:56.339]  He'd give an impassioned speech, have the people support, and they'd vote for him.
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:58.623]  Because behind the scenes, he'd come after you if he didn't.
[00:48:01.246 --> 00:48:08.973]  I mean, you rarely, even in like third world dictatorships, they act like they're not a dictator, so they get up and then the puppets vote.
[00:48:09.353 --> 00:48:17.341]  No, no, we got a president in America coming after our guns, and MSNBC saying our kids belong to them, and they're telling us how to talk?
[00:48:17.621 --> 00:48:18.562]  I mean, this is a cult!
[00:48:19.803 --> 00:48:21.384]  This is bonafide, folks!
[00:48:22.045 --> 00:48:24.707]  I mean, I don't have rhetoric to reach the level.
[00:48:25.288 --> 00:48:25.908]  My flesh
[00:48:26.986 --> 00:48:30.027]  My selfishness says get out of here now.
[00:48:30.487 --> 00:48:33.448]  Get your family and get out of the United States.
[00:48:33.508 --> 00:48:40.090]  Sure, there's nowhere to run long term, but my God, I don't have to sit here with a dictator that hates my guts.
[00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:43.151]  I mean, okay, America wants to be slaves, I'm out of here.
[00:48:43.871 --> 00:48:44.332]  But you know what?
[00:48:44.352 --> 00:48:48.673]  A lot of people don't want to be slaves, want to be free, and I've sworn I'm staying here to the end.
[00:48:50.499 --> 00:49:01.289]  Man, I tell you, it is incredible to see a president say, we can't wait for Congress to get in line with me on gun control.
[00:49:04.472 --> 00:49:05.493]  Get in line!
[00:49:06.734 --> 00:49:12.879]  That's what you tell your 10-year-old when you catch him smoking cigarettes behind the barn.
[00:49:15.302 --> 00:49:16.523]  Your 12-year-old, whatever.
[00:49:18.305 --> 00:49:20.027]  That's what they tell you in third world countries.
[00:49:20.427 --> 00:49:23.229]  Behind the scenes, the dictator goes, you get in line!
[00:49:24.631 --> 00:49:28.534]  But in America, they spy on us out in the open.
[00:49:28.554 --> 00:49:30.075]  They grope our daughters out in the open.
[00:49:30.215 --> 00:49:33.699]  They put cancer viruses in the vaccines and brain damages out in the open.
[00:49:33.959 --> 00:49:36.601]  And we're too stupid to see what's happening to us!
[00:49:40.905 --> 00:49:45.309]  This show transcends, though, all the lines, all the race garbage, all of it.
[00:49:47.864 --> 00:49:51.325]  And that's really what's so important about InfoWars and the responsibility we have.
[00:49:51.346 --> 00:50:02.890]  Because it doesn't matter if you're Vladimir Putin, doesn't matter if you're a top general at the Pentagon, doesn't matter if you're Louis Farrakhan, they listen to this show every day and every week.
[00:50:03.451 --> 00:50:06.712]  Farrakhan people, daily listeners, Farrakhan listener every week.
[00:50:06.732 --> 00:50:10.274]  And you're like, what does it matter if Louis Farrakhan listens to you?
[00:50:10.734 --> 00:50:13.355]  Louis Farrakhan has changed a lot, and he says that in the interview.
[00:50:14.855 --> 00:50:15.495]  That's what we want to do.
[00:50:15.515 --> 00:50:16.596]  We want to win, folks.
[00:50:16.796 --> 00:50:18.017]  We don't want to divide and conquer.
[00:50:18.157 --> 00:50:20.498]  We want to come together and say no to what's happening.
[00:50:22.519 --> 00:50:23.440]  Let's go out to break.
[00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:24.741]  I'm going to come back.
[00:50:27.863 --> 00:50:29.844]  With Obama just saying, you're going to get in line.
[00:50:31.064 --> 00:50:32.085]  People say, well, what's he going to do?
[00:50:32.105 --> 00:50:33.146]  He's got a low approval rating.
[00:50:33.166 --> 00:50:35.087]  How's he going to do it?
[00:50:36.608 --> 00:50:38.008]  It's the final chapter, folks.
[00:50:38.028 --> 00:50:39.009]  You know what comes next.
[00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:41.591]  The dreaded false flag.
[00:50:43.191 --> 00:50:43.912]  The atrocity.
[00:50:45.538 --> 00:50:50.620]  And the minute there is a building blown up, mass shooting, whatever, you cannot wait.
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:56.523]  You gotta have cameras ready, you gotta have your phone ready, you gotta go and videotape everything and upload it.
[00:50:57.043 --> 00:50:58.944]  And then we'll go over it all forensically.
[00:51:00.045 --> 00:51:07.328]  But we've got, when they run this false flag, to stop it, to expose it immediately.
[00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:09.009]  Stay with us.

[00:55:03.882 --> 00:55:09.709]  But those of us that love freedom are like high-powered, 700-horsepower cars, NASCARs.
[00:55:10.089 --> 00:55:15.316]  We can blow an engine, we can throw a rod, we can get angry, we can be mean to our family members, you name it.
[00:55:15.336 --> 00:55:21.864]  I mean, I have been not really mean, but super aggressive and super focused the last few days.
[00:55:24.082 --> 00:55:30.066]  And it's because my instincts are clean, my head's screwed on straight, and man, I love America.
[00:55:30.346 --> 00:55:32.027]  And I watched that guy out there with his fake tears.
[00:55:32.167 --> 00:55:35.029]  I've got tears right now, even though I don't want to have tears.
[00:55:35.269 --> 00:55:39.171]  I was so angry, I made myself settle down, and I'm angry because I'm so sad.
[00:55:39.191 --> 00:55:43.134]  I mean, we're really in the hands of some bad people, but of course we are!
[00:55:43.154 --> 00:55:44.415]  We sell babies!
[00:55:44.455 --> 00:55:46.076]  They keep them alive and sell them!
[00:55:46.596 --> 00:55:47.817]  They don't just chop them up!
[00:55:50.421 --> 00:55:52.983]  People thought I was crazy 20 years ago exposing that.
[00:55:53.343 --> 00:55:58.906]  That's the first stuff I was doing with George Woolley and the big anti-abortion Catholic groups here in town.
[00:56:00.147 --> 00:56:01.988]  I wasn't Catholic, but they were the ones fighting it.
[00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:10.833]  Man, the feds would go after those groups that were exposing that they were keeping the babies alive to harvest their organs.
[00:56:11.514 --> 00:56:13.435]  I mean, of course we're in trouble, folks.
[00:56:13.815 --> 00:56:16.217]  We don't even protect babies!
[00:56:17.285 --> 00:56:19.066]  OF COURSE THEY'RE GONNA TAKE THE GUNS!
[00:56:19.366 --> 00:56:21.167]  OF COURSE THEY'RE GONNA TAKE YOUR PENSIONS!
[00:56:21.847 --> 00:56:22.248]  IDIOTS!
[00:56:23.608 --> 00:56:25.969]  I'm talking to those of you out there that laugh all day.
[00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:34.133]  All you trendies with your smartphones and your fun and your craft beers and the whole world's just your little fun land.
[00:56:34.474 --> 00:56:38.936]  You were given all this to lull you into a false sense of security.
[00:56:42.057 --> 00:56:45.059]  Right up until every German city was burned and destroyed.
[00:56:46.297 --> 00:56:47.978]  And 21 million were dead.
[00:56:48.398 --> 00:56:53.822]  Germans still had little free Nazi beer halls and dances and the women were told, have sex with everybody.
[00:56:54.182 --> 00:56:55.583]  Have sex with the factory workers.
[00:56:55.823 --> 00:56:57.084]  Have sex with all the soldiers.
[00:56:57.104 --> 00:56:58.285]  20 men a week.
[00:56:58.926 --> 00:56:59.286]  Do it!
[00:56:59.906 --> 00:57:00.707]  We're gonna party!
[00:57:01.988 --> 00:57:06.371]  And because Hitler let them socially party, they fought to the end.
[00:57:07.472 --> 00:57:11.115]  Because it was okay now to have sex with five women a day if you wanted to.
[00:57:11.875 --> 00:57:13.717]  They know what they're doing, people.
[00:57:13.917 --> 00:57:16.079]  And I'm not even saying don't have sex with five women a day.
[00:57:16.119 --> 00:57:22.163]  I'm not even... The point is they do that so you're so sexually drunk that you don't even care.
[00:57:26.166 --> 00:57:26.987]  I didn't get to the clips.
[00:57:27.087 --> 00:57:33.512]  I mean, I've got the clip here of him saying I can't be a dictator because the Constitution two years ago and now I've got him saying Congress better get in line.
[00:57:37.756 --> 00:57:42.479]  We've had David Icke scheduled for months now, and he's a big guest, and I like him.
[00:57:42.519 --> 00:57:43.880]  He's a big, open, free thinker.
[00:57:46.501 --> 00:57:51.504]  I'm glad he's coming on, but I am going to play this dictator clips coming up.
[00:57:52.565 --> 00:57:53.625]  Briefly, we need funds.
[00:57:55.466 --> 00:57:57.948]  We're under attack constantly, which I'm not complaining about.
[00:57:58.953 --> 00:58:02.634]  But basically, I'm getting stabbed politically all the time, and blood's pouring out.
[00:58:03.334 --> 00:58:08.315]  But it is literal transfusions as you pray for us, spread the word, and buy our products.
[00:58:08.355 --> 00:58:12.237]  So as fast as they can suck blood and cut me up, the wounds are healing.
[00:58:12.637 --> 00:58:18.198]  But when you pray for us, when you buy our products, when you spread the word, we literally are healing as we're being attacked.
[00:58:18.218 --> 00:58:18.858]  You understand?
[00:58:19.098 --> 00:58:21.119]  This is how these wars are fought, an info war.
[00:58:22.939 --> 00:58:24.500]  And so I need you to go to infowarestore.com.
[00:58:26.252 --> 00:58:27.594]  And I need you to buy the products.
[00:58:27.714 --> 00:58:28.816]  I need you to get aggressive.
[00:58:28.836 --> 00:58:29.958]  We got the new calendar in.
[00:58:29.978 --> 00:58:32.241]  We only printed 10,000 of these and then they're gone.
[00:58:32.261 --> 00:58:35.306]  15% off everything ends Friday.
[00:58:37.455 --> 00:58:39.276]  And you can get the new InfoWars calendar for $6.95.
[00:58:40.077 --> 00:58:43.419]  It's got Leanne McAdoo as a pin-up girl and fun stuff like that.
[00:58:43.439 --> 00:58:48.083]  It's a really fun way to spread the word and it's got coupons in it worth thousands.
[00:58:48.663 --> 00:58:51.245]  InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:52.045 --> 00:58:52.406]  All right.
[00:58:53.366 --> 00:58:54.467]  But it's been 60 seconds.
[00:58:54.547 --> 00:58:55.448]  Fund us if you will.
[00:58:56.228 --> 00:58:57.189]  If you don't, whatever.
[00:58:57.329 --> 00:58:58.010]  We'll still fight.
[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:01.921]  I want more candy!
[00:59:01.941 --> 00:59:03.082]  I want more video games!
[00:59:03.242 --> 00:59:03.522]  Mine!
[00:59:03.762 --> 00:59:03.882]  Mine!
[00:59:03.902 --> 00:59:04.002]  Mine!
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:30.920]  That's right.
[01:00:03.095 --> 01:00:05.816]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:20.563 --> 01:00:23.204]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:23.244 --> 01:00:28.386]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:00:31.511 --> 01:00:34.233]  Well I'm here to tell you there are no spectators in what's coming up.
[01:00:36.054 --> 01:00:36.934]  What's already here.
[01:00:38.535 --> 01:00:43.839]  You can lie to yourself and say you can stand on the sidelines.
[01:00:44.279 --> 01:00:47.341]  Out here in the arena we've got our torches and the wolves are around us.
[01:00:47.781 --> 01:00:48.501]  We can see them.
[01:00:49.162 --> 01:00:50.623]  You think you're safe in the woods?
[01:00:52.224 --> 01:00:54.345]  You think you're safe up there in the bleachers in the dark?
[01:00:55.806 --> 01:00:57.667]  Now I want to take this enemy on head on.
[01:01:02.463 --> 01:01:04.163]  I need everybody out there to take action.
[01:01:06.584 --> 01:01:07.964]  You do need to get a piece of the action.
[01:01:12.706 --> 01:01:13.546]  This is your chance.
[01:01:13.626 --> 01:01:14.646]  Battle for the Republic.
[01:01:15.526 --> 01:01:16.527]  It's an info war.
[01:01:18.367 --> 01:01:21.648]  The enemy wants to make it physical because politically.
[01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:36.378]  We have a very unpopular dictator, a globalist frontman, who's now revealing himself in their desperateness to force the agenda, and to cause physical resistance, so they can have a massive crackdown.
[01:01:37.879 --> 01:01:49.646]  I'm gonna be honest with folks, if it goes physical... I don't even know if I wanna say what I think's gonna happen, what I know is gonna happen.
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:53.561]  Because I'm not saying that's a good thing.
[01:01:53.661 --> 01:02:06.249]  I am not for a military coup in this country, but George Soros, Obama, and the rest of them, Michael Moore, Hillary Clinton, all of you, you guys have gone too far.
[01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:10.132]  Everybody who has a brain knows you are trash.
[01:02:11.793 --> 01:02:15.295]  And I would really advise you to back off right now.
[01:02:18.703 --> 01:02:21.404]  Everybody knows we don't play games, we don't bluff here.
[01:02:22.444 --> 01:02:24.625]  And I just know the sense of this country and this world.
[01:02:26.105 --> 01:02:26.645]  And the climate.
[01:02:27.366 --> 01:02:34.428]  And you may be insulated up there on the Potomac like King George was in 1775.
[01:02:38.129 --> 01:02:40.049]  But we're never gonna submit to you.
[01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:43.350]  We're never gonna roll over to you.
[01:02:44.271 --> 01:02:45.611]  And we've just begun to fight.
[01:02:46.211 --> 01:02:48.392]  We've just begun to wake up the sleeping giant.
[01:02:51.305 --> 01:02:52.725]  And we're never going to surrender.
[01:02:52.745 --> 01:03:14.933]  And as the medical tyranny gets worse and worse, and as people realize they submitted to the system and all it gave them was death, there's not gonna be anywhere safe for you people on the planet.
[01:03:15.953 --> 01:03:20.595]  And I know you don't care because it's your lust to hurt us
[01:03:21.701 --> 01:03:30.288]  Your lust to break us, your spirit's will, won't let you give up your attempt to hurt the innocents.
[01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:31.850]  I know.
[01:03:35.453 --> 01:03:49.245]  But I'm talking to your enforcers, many of which came from good families, many of which are honorable individuals who've been brought into evil incrementally until they woke up one day and didn't know who they were anymore.
[01:03:50.933 --> 01:04:01.437]  The fact that you don't know who you are, the fact that you still are scared, shows you've still got a soul left.
[01:04:03.098 --> 01:04:07.700]  And it's never too late until you've totally given yourself over to evil.
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:14.163]  It's never too late when you still have that whisper of conscience to turn back.
[01:04:16.644 --> 01:04:23.827]  So many of you have joined this system because you're scared, or you want to belong, or you got into it and now you don't know where you are.
[01:04:25.708 --> 01:04:27.948]  The danger is in going along with this.
[01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:31.590]  The danger is submitting to globalism.
[01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:33.711]  Globalism is eugenics.
[01:04:33.871 --> 01:04:39.213]  It's scientific tyranny, technocracy, in their words.
[01:04:41.653 --> 01:04:49.455]  The public Bilderberg meeting, Davos, the last two years running, they say, we are dictatorial, we are technocratic.
[01:04:49.475 --> 01:04:53.135]  Remember that article in Now for World Government five years ago?
[01:04:54.036 --> 01:04:54.656]  Six years ago?
[01:04:55.096 --> 01:04:56.456]  In the Financial Times of London?
[01:04:57.176 --> 01:05:03.718]  Where the editor, foreign editor, says, yes, we're authoritarians, and we are going to take your freedoms.
[01:05:04.678 --> 01:05:05.578]  Because we know best.
[01:05:06.718 --> 01:05:09.259]  Then you look at what they're trying to set up, and it's a nightmare.
[01:05:10.578 --> 01:05:17.064]  The Obama administration is pushing for the largest gun grab in American history.
[01:05:17.245 --> 01:05:21.168]  We're also taking steps to make the background check system more efficient.
[01:05:21.509 --> 01:05:25.232]  And we're going to bring an outdated background check system into the 21st century.
[01:05:25.453 --> 01:05:29.757]  Anyone critical of the government could have their Second Amendment rights taken away.
[01:05:30.057 --> 01:05:45.828]  Simply if psychologists diagnose them with what they are calling oppositional defiant disorder, which the American Psychiatric Association describes as a defiant, disobedient, and hostile behavior toward authority.
[01:05:46.068 --> 01:05:53.934]  Other measures will allow doctors to report patients to the FBI and RFID tracking with smart guns.
[01:05:54.134 --> 01:05:55.835]  We're going to boost gun safety technology.
[01:05:56.095 --> 01:05:58.857]  We need to develop new technologies that make guns safer.
[01:05:59.358 --> 01:06:04.702]  We can set it up so you can't unlock your phone unless you got the right fingerprint.
[01:06:04.862 --> 01:06:06.263]  Why can't we do the same thing for our guns?
[01:06:06.723 --> 01:06:09.906]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:10.326 --> 01:06:15.150]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[01:07:10.382 --> 01:07:19.645]  Infowarslife and Infowarslife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[01:07:19.886 --> 01:07:24.467]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[01:07:24.567 --> 01:07:28.949]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:32.250]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:34.491]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[01:07:34.811 --> 01:07:38.233]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[01:07:38.373 --> 01:07:42.214]  Winter Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of vitamin D3.
[01:07:42.254 --> 01:07:45.876]  The research and development took over two years, but the result is
[01:07:45.936 --> 01:07:50.937]  As verified by independent laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[01:07:51.298 --> 01:07:56.039]  Read the facts at InfoWarsLife.com about Winter Sun vitamin D3.
[01:07:56.319 --> 01:08:01.961]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.
[01:08:02.261 --> 01:08:04.041]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[01:08:04.401 --> 01:08:07.022]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[01:08:13.382 --> 01:08:19.407]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:20.027 --> 01:08:23.069]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:26.972 --> 01:08:41.823]  Joining us about 20 minutes into the next hour is one of the other leading questioners of official thought, and that is David Icke from the UK.
[01:08:43.083 --> 01:08:46.164]  He'll be joining us here in about three, four minutes from now.
[01:08:46.184 --> 01:08:49.465]  In fact, we have him now, as a lot of TV viewers can see right there.
[01:08:50.286 --> 01:08:58.329]  We are also simulcasting the radio show, as we've done in the last 16, 17 years, at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:08:58.349 --> 01:09:05.331]  I know it gets confusing for some people out there, because they hear me talking about put this on screen, put that on screen.
[01:09:06.272 --> 01:09:12.214]  I would go out and shoot video of UN signs at parks, show the treaty, saying it means they own and control the property around it.
[01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:13.054]  I think?
[01:09:29.654 --> 01:09:33.637]  About a month ago on the show because he's been very busy and because he's being persecuted.
[01:09:33.657 --> 01:09:36.018]  They try to keep him from traveling to Canada.
[01:09:36.058 --> 01:09:40.581]  They try to keep him from traveling to Australia to give a speech to thousands of people.
[01:09:41.242 --> 01:09:51.048]  He's a guy that's filled stadiums with upwards of 20,000 people I know, if memory serves, and whose books have been read by tens of millions, videos seen by hundreds of millions.
[01:09:52.049 --> 01:09:52.990]  And you notice they want to ban
[01:09:54.841 --> 01:09:56.683]  Donald Trump from traveling to the UK now.
[01:09:56.903 --> 01:09:57.784]  The government's looking at it.
[01:09:57.844 --> 01:10:02.929]  They want to say of the IRS claims, they're going to investigate you.
[01:10:02.969 --> 01:10:03.850]  No judge, no jury.
[01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:05.291]  You just can't fly in America.
[01:10:05.891 --> 01:10:09.235]  Obama says he wants to apply that same legalese, because he's a constitutional lawyer.
[01:10:10.716 --> 01:10:13.499]  What a joke, to gun owners.
[01:10:13.719 --> 01:10:14.480]  You're not a criminal.
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:15.461]  They won't tell you why.
[01:10:15.481 --> 01:10:16.361]  You're just put on a list.
[01:10:17.233 --> 01:10:18.394]  This is the essence of 1984.
[01:10:19.455 --> 01:10:20.455]  Kafka-esque.
[01:10:20.656 --> 01:10:22.997]  The essence of the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany.
[01:10:23.338 --> 01:10:28.602]  But he's a constitutional lawyer, so the press all laughs and giggles and smiles at him.
[01:10:29.482 --> 01:10:33.425]  Because, I'm gonna play these clips right now, it all ties into the classical tyranny we're witnessing.
[01:10:33.686 --> 01:10:35.427]  Regardless of what you think about guns.
[01:10:38.850 --> 01:10:41.251]  The President's protected by guns and taxpayer money.
[01:10:41.752 --> 01:10:43.073]  Michael Moore's got bodyguards.
[01:10:45.114 --> 01:10:52.640]  They're funding ISIS with weapons to carry out all these crimes, and then crying about the few hundred people that die a year in mass shootings, statistically very low.
[01:10:54.601 --> 01:11:01.126]  But notice Obama said on April 5th, 2013, I'm constrained by the system our founders put in place.
[01:11:01.606 --> 01:11:03.528]  I'd like to be able to restrict this, but I can't.
[01:11:03.848 --> 01:11:11.133]  Well, he said yesterday, and we're going to play this clip, we can't wait for Congress to get in line with me on gun control.
[01:11:11.313 --> 01:11:13.135]  In line with me!
[01:11:14.858 --> 01:11:16.659]  Can't get them to restrict guns in Congress.
[01:11:18.759 --> 01:11:23.601]  FBI admits crime rates down upwards of 60-something percent since 1992.
[01:11:23.681 --> 01:11:25.262]  I kept saying 51.
[01:11:25.962 --> 01:11:27.622]  Professor Locke came on and said, no, it's really about 61.
[01:11:29.483 --> 01:11:30.543]  But regardless, even the L.A.
[01:11:30.563 --> 01:11:35.345]  Times admit gun crime way down as gun ownership goes up because the criminals are afraid.
[01:11:35.725 --> 01:11:41.827]  The places that are super dangerous are New York, D.C., Chicago, where there are no legitimate gun owners.
[01:11:42.727 --> 01:11:44.268]  And then the criminals just run crazy.
[01:11:46.334 --> 01:11:53.000]  Regardless, we are a violent, barbaric society, but they want to be the only ones with the monopoly of power, as the UN said.
[01:11:53.260 --> 01:12:10.194]  So this ties into what David Icke's been talking about, where he's never said one racist thing about anybody, he's what I'd call a classical liberal, the former head of the Green Party, been given awards by major African tribes in Africa, you name it, and
[01:12:11.226 --> 01:12:16.249]  They're now taking people off international satellite because they quote, said something bad about Israel.
[01:12:16.269 --> 01:12:17.230]  I have articles today.
[01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:19.271]  People say, well good, that's anti-semitic.
[01:12:19.831 --> 01:12:20.031]  No.
[01:12:20.352 --> 01:12:22.253]  Then you take everybody's free speech away.
[01:12:22.553 --> 01:12:25.254]  Don't you see, folks, they're going after all of our rights.
[01:12:25.995 --> 01:12:28.136]  Illegal spying, saying we don't have medical rights.
[01:12:28.196 --> 01:12:28.516]  It's happening.
[01:12:28.536 --> 01:12:29.197]  I want to play these clips.
[01:12:29.217 --> 01:12:29.797]  They go to David Icke.
[01:12:30.057 --> 01:12:31.658]  Because it sets the table for everything that's happening.
[01:12:31.939 --> 01:12:32.399]  Obama.
[01:12:32.959 --> 01:12:36.221]  Let's go back to April of 2013 when he said this.
[01:12:36.281 --> 01:12:37.062]  He's not a dictator.
[01:12:37.102 --> 01:12:37.402]  Here it is.
[01:12:38.795 --> 01:12:39.876]  You hear some of these quotes.
[01:12:40.296 --> 01:12:42.157]  I need a gun to protect myself from the government.
[01:12:44.939 --> 01:12:50.803]  We can't do background checks because the government's gonna come take my guns away.
[01:12:56.688 --> 01:12:57.348]  The government's us.
[01:12:58.849 --> 01:12:59.209]  Oh really?
[01:12:59.730 --> 01:13:02.492]  The foreign insurance companies that brought Obama here?
[01:13:09.429 --> 01:13:11.570]  They are elected by you, I am elected by you.
[01:13:11.670 --> 01:13:17.792]  I'm constrained as they are constrained by a system that our founders put in place.
[01:13:18.152 --> 01:13:20.013]  This is a government of and by and for the people.
[01:13:23.374 --> 01:13:38.859]  And so surely we can have a debate that's not based on the notion somehow that your elected representatives are trying to do something to you other than potentially prevent
[01:13:41.465 --> 01:13:51.373]  Another group of families from grieving the way the families of Aurora or Newtown or Columbine have grieved.
[01:13:52.154 --> 01:13:55.657]  All right, so he's constrained by the system our founders put in place.
[01:13:55.957 --> 01:13:56.978]  He's not a dictator.
[01:13:57.338 --> 01:14:06.145]  Fast forward two years, and he says, we can't wait for Congress to get in line with me on gun control.
[01:14:06.345 --> 01:14:08.847]  So he's admitting he's violating the system.
[01:14:09.107 --> 01:14:10.108]  He's violating the law.
[01:14:10.368 --> 01:14:10.709]  Here it is.
[01:14:11.929 --> 01:14:14.150]  Now I want to be clear, Congress still needs to act.
[01:14:17.051 --> 01:14:19.612]  The folks in this room will not rest until Congress does.
[01:14:20.072 --> 01:14:23.774]  You just don't want to act as a dictator alone, you want them to certify it.
[01:14:25.535 --> 01:14:27.756]  But if they won't, you'll just be naked and do it.
[01:14:27.776 --> 01:14:37.740]  Because once Congress gets on board with common sense gun safety measures, we can reduce gun violence
[01:14:39.272 --> 01:14:41.833]  A whole lot more.
[01:14:41.873 --> 01:14:44.734]  But we also can't wait.
[01:14:46.334 --> 01:14:58.138]  Until we have a Congress that's in line with the majority of Americans, there are actions within my legal authority that we can take to help reduce gun violence and save more lives.
[01:14:59.339 --> 01:15:02.140]  Actions that protect our rights and our kids.
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.321]  After Sandy Hook,
[01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:16.531]  Joe and I work together with our teams and we put forward a whole series of executive actions to try to tighten up
[01:15:18.214 --> 01:15:21.175]  The existing rules and systems that we had in place.
[01:15:21.615 --> 01:15:21.855]  Okay.
[01:15:22.215 --> 01:15:37.259]  And there are some executive actions you could argue they could do, but these are national registration, not letting you transfer weapons, making a biometrics on them and micro-stamping that bankrupts everything and doesn't work, and saying we can just put you on a mental health list or a no-fly list and then a no-gun-by list, just like David Icke.
[01:15:37.639 --> 01:15:39.640]  Oh, David, you can't fly to Canada.
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:40.800]  You can't fly to Australia.
[01:15:41.741 --> 01:15:44.322]  Because you write books about a world government coming.
[01:15:44.603 --> 01:15:46.424]  But now the Pope announces world government.
[01:15:46.784 --> 01:15:49.245]  Now they openly announce they want war with Russia.
[01:15:49.745 --> 01:15:53.187]  Everything David Icke's basically been writing about is now unfolding.
[01:15:53.568 --> 01:15:54.928]  So they've got a problem, David.
[01:15:54.968 --> 01:15:56.949]  I guess now they just need to shut us up.
[01:15:57.390 --> 01:15:59.151]  You've been doing this 20 plus years.
[01:15:59.211 --> 01:16:00.231]  I've been doing it 20 years.
[01:16:00.271 --> 01:16:01.052]  You longer than I.
[01:16:01.872 --> 01:16:02.773]  I mean, wow!
[01:16:03.574 --> 01:16:04.995]  It is really happening.
[01:16:05.756 --> 01:16:08.338]  You said 2016 would be all hell break loose.
[01:16:08.378 --> 01:16:09.539]  You wrote that 10 years ago.
[01:16:09.959 --> 01:16:13.182]  But you said that would be the beginning of the end of their system.
[01:16:13.863 --> 01:16:15.284]  Do you still stand by that?
[01:16:15.324 --> 01:16:17.106]  Because, I mean, I certainly hope you're right.
[01:16:17.146 --> 01:16:18.046]  It's the beginning of the end.
[01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:19.868]  You've been proven right in your predictions.
[01:16:20.308 --> 01:16:22.670]  I just hope your latter predictions are right as well, David.
[01:16:24.261 --> 01:16:31.852]  Well, Alex, you'll have to forgive me, first of all, I'm not feeling too good because I'm suffering from oppositional defiant disorder.
[01:16:31.892 --> 01:16:32.874]  Apparently it's catching.
[01:16:33.675 --> 01:16:37.300]  And we are facing, I would suggest,
[01:16:38.654 --> 01:16:41.895]  Three years that will decide which way this goes.
[01:16:42.636 --> 01:16:51.639]  I think 2016, 2017 and 2018 are going to be pivotal years in deciding where this world goes.
[01:16:52.299 --> 01:16:58.702]  Because if we allow the system to go on, the agenda to go on,
[01:16:59.642 --> 01:16:59.822]  I'm
[01:17:14.918 --> 01:17:31.043]  In greater and greater numbers people are beginning to reassess the world and reassess themselves and reassess life and what's giving me tremendous encouragement is where these people are coming from.
[01:17:31.544 --> 01:17:33.344]  They're coming from within the system now.
[01:17:34.225 --> 01:17:36.265]  That's my personal experience anyway.
[01:17:36.965 --> 01:17:43.648]  They're people who would never have questioned anything before and then suddenly they're looking at it and
[01:17:45.071 --> 01:17:51.232]  Concepts that would have been totally alien to them a very short time ago are now starting to make sense.
[01:17:51.773 --> 01:17:58.854]  And, you know, I said many years ago there's going to come a time when this agenda is going to have to break the surface.
[01:18:00.635 --> 01:18:03.155]  People would not believe how long this has been going on.
[01:18:03.435 --> 01:18:05.196]  This is not a modern thing.
[01:18:05.216 --> 01:18:14.358]  This has been going on generation after generation after generation as the ground has been prepared for this global fascist Orwellian state.
[01:18:15.689 --> 01:18:20.031]  And in that period, it's been able to stay under the radar.
[01:18:20.531 --> 01:18:23.053]  It's been able to manipulate in the shadows.
[01:18:23.533 --> 01:18:28.055]  It's been able to get things ready to be played out in the public arena.
[01:18:29.896 --> 01:18:35.259]  But of course, if you are gonna actually make your world
[01:18:36.301 --> 01:18:45.004]  happened, then at some point you have got to start playing those things out from the shadows into the public arena where we can see them.
[01:18:45.744 --> 01:18:47.245]  And that's where we are now.
[01:18:47.325 --> 01:18:52.127]  Now, that shows that the agenda has moved on, but there's another aspect to this.
[01:18:52.747 --> 01:19:01.510]  This is a very, very dangerous time for the agenda and those behind it, because they can't hide anymore.
[01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:03.191]  It's in your face.
[01:19:04.491 --> 01:19:06.813]  And it's impacting on people's lives.
[01:19:07.393 --> 01:19:25.786]  And what we need to do in this alternative independent arena is to redouble and redouble our efforts to present to the widest possible audience another narrative, another explanation of world events.
[01:19:26.775 --> 01:19:36.261]  Which challenged the random presentation of it's all random events and show how it all fits together.
[01:19:36.782 --> 01:19:48.490]  Show how 9-11 and what's happening in Syria, gun control laws and mass immigration out of the Middle East into Europe is all connected.
[01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:52.092]  They're all dominoes in the same line.
[01:19:52.732 --> 01:19:56.415]  And when people take the trouble
[01:19:57.155 --> 01:20:13.888]  To read or listen to this narrative, as I know from personal experience, it makes far more sense of the world than that it's all a random accident and the... And David, it goes further than that now.
[01:20:13.968 --> 01:20:15.389]  It's happening by chance.
[01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:16.730]  He goes further, as you know.
[01:20:17.230 --> 01:20:18.431]  Brzezinski writes books.
[01:20:18.972 --> 01:20:20.152]  Kissinger writes books.
[01:20:21.073 --> 01:20:22.895]  The White House science czar writes books.
[01:20:22.955 --> 01:20:24.616]  The head of the Kissinger group writes books.
[01:20:24.996 --> 01:20:27.958]  They write books and admit, okay, there are too many of you.
[01:20:28.018 --> 01:20:29.439]  Okay, we are putting stuff in the water.
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:31.941]  Okay, we are going to merge with machines and become gods.
[01:20:32.722 --> 01:20:35.584]  Okay, we are trying to create black holes and play God at CERN.
[01:20:36.044 --> 01:20:37.325]  I mean, what's crazy is
[01:20:38.266 --> 01:20:58.202]  They've gone from denying it, where I've had the host of, you know, ABC News here and Nightline, and I show him six or seven clips of world leaders calling for world government just five years ago, and he looks at me and he goes, that's a different world government than the one you're talking about, to now they go, yes, world government's here, it's run by private banks, but still you're a kook and you're bad, and you need to be arrested.
[01:20:58.863 --> 01:21:02.646]  I mean, it's so bizarre to see how many people are awakening.
[01:21:03.326 --> 01:21:07.588]  Including world leaders and people, and very prominent folks, and people in the system.
[01:21:07.628 --> 01:21:08.749]  As you said, that's what I'm seeing.
[01:21:09.969 --> 01:21:18.894]  In the system of all places, but then the general public large swaths, like, get off on it and want to join with it, even though it hurts them.
[01:21:19.274 --> 01:21:24.237]  It's like they're nihilistic and are in a trance, like lemmings running off a cliff.
[01:21:24.897 --> 01:21:26.238]  It's quite a paradox.
[01:21:27.642 --> 01:21:34.944]  Well, I've just got a new book that's just come out, it's called Phantom Self, and the subtitle is How to Find the Real One.
[01:21:36.024 --> 01:21:48.868]  And what I show there is the scale of programming, perception programming, that starts when you leave the womb.
[01:21:49.795 --> 01:22:16.904]  So, by the time you get into the adult world, if you have not opened your mind to see beyond the norms you've been programmed to accept is reality, then the only fix, the only way that you can understand the world is on the basis of the perception programming that you've, well, it's literally downloaded.
[01:22:18.956 --> 01:22:24.058]  And so, if you come out of the womb, you are then influenced by parents.
[01:22:24.138 --> 01:22:29.661]  Not parents, overwhelmingly, that do it from a malevolent point of view.
[01:22:30.301 --> 01:22:38.525]  They have been programmed by going through the same system I'm just going to quickly describe, and thus they have taken on these perceptions of reality.
[01:22:39.907 --> 01:22:43.329]  And they then pass them on to the young child.
[01:22:43.389 --> 01:22:53.633]  And now, of course, at an earlier and earlier age, the state is getting control of children from the earlier and earlier ages.
[01:22:53.693 --> 01:23:01.637]  I mean, we've got a guy in the education establishment in Britain who, a year or so ago, called for children to start school at two.
[01:23:02.657 --> 01:23:13.943]  So, immediately, you come out of the womb, you have a short time, overwhelming with parents that are passing on the program because that's what they've taken on, and then you hit the system.
[01:23:14.384 --> 01:23:30.333]  Suddenly, as a small child, you are sitting in a chair in a classroom, and an authority figure is telling you what's right, what's wrong, what's real, what's not real, when you can go to the toilet, when you have to be there, when you can go home.
[01:23:30.933 --> 01:23:36.296]  Schools, I mean, it's like I say, take a deep breath, take a step back, look at it again.
[01:23:36.857 --> 01:23:39.859]  Schools are prisons for children.
[01:23:40.239 --> 01:23:41.500]  But they're worse than that.
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:45.322]  They are programming centers and prisons for children.
[01:23:45.402 --> 01:23:52.587]  And if you go further back and look at it, at least before, you might have different teachers, different ideas in school.
[01:23:53.507 --> 01:23:55.649]  But the new systems are dumbing them down.
[01:23:55.829 --> 01:23:58.572]  Physically the IQ is going down, not just the education.
[01:23:58.892 --> 01:24:06.279]  They're openly scrambling the education, 2 plus 2 equals 5, to literally fry their brains and it's not even different teachers now.
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:16.269]  It's globally UNESCO approved UN curricula under treaty worldwide in over 90% of the schools on the planet
[01:24:17.149 --> 01:24:27.339]  Literally teaching them how to be mental midget conformist morons who are never conscious and will accept whatever the new contradictory download is.
[01:24:28.059 --> 01:24:33.144]  Exactly, well Bill Gates is involved in that in America and anything Bill Gates is in is the agenda.
[01:24:33.764 --> 01:24:41.571]  You look at everything that he's involved in, it's like a wish list for the agenda that he's funding through his foundation with his Mrs.
[01:24:43.593 --> 01:25:11.846]  But this education foundation of the program is so vital because you go on to college and you go on to university, or many people do, and then from that base programming, this is the world, this is reality, this is how it is, and I've debated Alex many times at Oxford University, and this is the elite university in Britain, and I've not been asked a challenging question.
[01:25:12.866 --> 01:25:15.128]  The level of programming is extraordinary.
[01:25:15.588 --> 01:25:16.949]  And then, what happens?
[01:25:17.489 --> 01:25:25.594]  From that base programming, people go out to be doctors, they go out to be scientists, they go out to be politicians, they go out to be journalists.
[01:25:26.114 --> 01:25:32.338]  And from that base programming, they're all coming, unless they become in any way conscious beyond the program,
[01:25:33.078 --> 01:25:35.601]  They are viewing the world the same way.
[01:25:36.361 --> 01:25:43.789]  So, where do the mainstream media go to get a fix on reality, when they actually bother to question it at all?
[01:25:44.169 --> 01:25:47.092]  They go to scientists who are the system's scientists.
[01:25:47.453 --> 01:25:50.416]  They go to the system's doctors when they want to talk about health.
[01:25:50.916 --> 01:26:05.772]  And anyone who's outside of that programmed sense of everything, medicine, science, politics, economics, they are by definition a kook because they are outside the norm.
[01:26:05.792 --> 01:26:06.993]  This is how it works.
[01:26:07.774 --> 01:26:27.548]  And it's extraordinary the level of programming, and I would say this, I've said it before in the books, you know, I think there's a very good chance that the level of programming is such, the level of perception program is such, that vast numbers of people, possibly the vast majority,
[01:26:28.228 --> 01:26:34.434]  Go through an entire lifetime without an original thought or emotional response that hasn't come from the program.
[01:26:34.915 --> 01:26:39.400]  And if people just ask themselves the question, what do I believe?
[01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:43.604]  And then ask the next question, why do I believe it?
[01:26:43.724 --> 01:26:45.005]  Where is it come from?
[01:26:45.886 --> 01:26:51.771]  And it will invariably have come from some aspect or some expression of the system.
[01:26:52.491 --> 01:26:58.095]  And like the Nazis said, you know, give me the child to the age of seven and I'll show you the man.
[01:26:58.175 --> 01:27:02.739]  Well, they have control of young people now well beyond the age of seven.
[01:27:03.119 --> 01:27:05.260]  And as you rightly say, what we're seeing
[01:27:06.341 --> 01:27:10.485]  Because, you know, I'm coming up 64, so I was born in 1952.
[01:27:11.366 --> 01:27:16.051]  I remember the education system as it was in the 50s, and I've seen it change.
[01:27:16.091 --> 01:27:29.003]  This is why our generations are so pivotal in what's happening, because we have a point of reference before this got really, really extreme, and thus we can see how extreme it is.
[01:27:29.864 --> 01:27:36.110]  And what's happening with the education system is it's, and again, because of what I said earlier... Oh, you can see where it's going.
[01:27:36.270 --> 01:27:40.193]  Oh, you can't be a cowboy or a native at Halloween.
[01:27:40.254 --> 01:27:41.755]  Let's just ban Halloween altogether.
[01:27:41.775 --> 01:27:43.536]  Or ban paper bags, they're hateful.
[01:27:44.137 --> 01:27:45.819]  Or ban the name Boyer Girl.
[01:27:46.419 --> 01:27:48.401]  Or ban Lynch Hall, because it's scary.
[01:27:48.441 --> 01:27:50.503]  And we all look at that and say, that's crazy.
[01:27:50.563 --> 01:27:50.963]  It's not.
[01:27:51.283 --> 01:27:55.888]  They're getting rid of all the words, just like George Orwell warned was the...
[01:27:56.508 --> 01:28:07.012]  was the plan to where we can't even communicate with these people and they're going to grow up in a system where they have no bearing or no idea or even any sense.
[01:28:07.392 --> 01:28:17.396]  I mean, they could tell young people that women never had babies, say vaginally, and I think they would believe that cesarean section was the way babies were born, or that women never breastfed.
[01:28:17.616 --> 01:28:19.157]  I mean, the world they're bringing in
[01:28:20.037 --> 01:28:27.501]  They're basically looking at women like they're crazy now if they don't want to have a cesarean up front, or if they want to breastfeed, they act like it's weird.
[01:28:27.781 --> 01:28:34.484]  I mean, everything normal, everything natural is supposedly evil, because you're right, we're all in a giant prison.
[01:28:35.104 --> 01:28:43.248]  We're being forced into the physical matrix with the virtual reality helmets we're going to put on, and the Pentagon admits that's the plan.
[01:28:43.888 --> 01:28:44.689]  So why
[01:28:45.589 --> 01:28:53.455]  Would insiders, David, who know where this really leads, want to be for this because they're promised they're going to be part of the power structure in the future?
[01:28:54.535 --> 01:28:57.618]  Well, there's a few things I'd like to say about what you just said.
[01:28:58.078 --> 01:29:01.160]  I think there's some points there to go with.
[01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:11.748]  But in terms of what you just asked, there is a major incentive for such people in the sense of
[01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:15.538]  Being frightened not to go with it.
[01:29:16.581 --> 01:29:30.913]  You know, if you've seen consequences for others of not going with something, then if your backbone is not made of steel, then you will go with something merely out of self-preservation.
[01:29:31.533 --> 01:29:35.937]  And then there's the other incentive that if you go with it, there are rewards for that.
[01:29:36.537 --> 01:29:37.198]  Stay there, David.
[01:29:37.478 --> 01:29:37.898]  David Icke.
[01:29:37.938 --> 01:29:39.159]  DavidIcke.com is our guest.
[01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:43.943]  Iconic author, researcher, outside-the-box kingpin.
[01:29:44.784 --> 01:29:46.706]  We're gonna come back and talk about what he just started mentioning.
[01:29:47.046 --> 01:29:53.391]  You know, China, they're bringing the system here, where you have a social score for going along with the system, or you can't buy or sell.
[01:29:53.792 --> 01:29:55.453]  It's called the Mark of the Beast, you might have heard of it.
[01:29:59.997 --> 01:30:03.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:06.623]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.959 --> 01:30:23.023]  While President Obama attempts to enact gun control via executive action, a new Gallup poll shows that only 2% of Americans believe that guns or gun control are among the country's top problems.
[01:30:23.423 --> 01:30:29.645]  Gallup asked about 1,000 Americans in all 50 states what they thought the nation's top problems were in 2015.
[01:30:30.505 --> 01:30:36.648]  And out of 23 problems mentioned by Americans, guns, gun control ranked near the bottom at 19th.
[01:30:37.108 --> 01:30:37.868]  In comparison,
[01:30:38.308 --> 01:30:42.251]  Sixteen percent of Americans said that the government was the nation's biggest issue.
[01:30:42.631 --> 01:30:44.412]  Thirteen percent said the economy.
[01:30:44.832 --> 01:30:48.275]  Eight percent said unemployment, and another eight said immigration.
[01:30:48.755 --> 01:31:03.725]  But rather than working on these hot-button issues, both President Obama and the mainstream media would rather focus on gun control, with the president even stating that he wants to, quote, make gun control part of his legacy, end quote, according to CNN.
[01:31:04.165 --> 01:31:07.888]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[01:31:10.464 --> 01:31:13.666]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:13.967 --> 01:31:21.993]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:22.213 --> 01:31:27.236]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:31:27.637 --> 01:31:29.918]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:31:41.397 --> 01:31:43.499]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:31:43.619 --> 01:31:48.344]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[01:31:48.604 --> 01:31:50.265]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[01:31:50.305 --> 01:31:51.747]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:31:51.887 --> 01:31:55.130]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:31:55.390 --> 01:31:57.072]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:31:57.352 --> 01:31:58.253]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[01:31:58.273 --> 01:31:59.213]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:31:59.453 --> 01:32:01.334]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[01:32:01.454 --> 01:32:09.439]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:16.844]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.tv, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[01:32:16.944 --> 01:32:19.645]  We've always offered five months free.
[01:32:19.826 --> 01:32:25.389]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[01:32:25.709 --> 01:32:28.871]  PrisonPlanet.tv began 15 years ago.
[01:32:29.151 --> 01:32:32.133]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[01:32:32.433 --> 01:32:41.178]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books, and other exclusive documentaries are available for streaming or download in HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:41.398 --> 01:32:52.124]  You don't just get six months free when you sign up from Christmas through New Year's, you also get to share that membership with up to 20 people simultaneously using your username.
[01:32:52.384 --> 01:32:59.790]  You can also sign up for a trial month and only pay $5.95, and then 20 of you and your friends and family can watch PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:59.970 --> 01:33:02.012]  Get 20 memberships at half price.
[01:33:02.032 --> 01:33:04.033]  Be the Paul Revere in your community.
[01:33:04.133 --> 01:33:07.676]  That's 6 months free when you sign up for a year at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:20.632 --> 01:33:25.742]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:32.492 --> 01:33:32.972]  Welcome back.
[01:33:33.032 --> 01:33:34.653]  Alex Jones here broadcasting worldwide.
[01:33:34.673 --> 01:33:35.594]  David Icke is our guest.
[01:33:35.614 --> 01:33:37.094]  We'll be with us 20 minutes to the next hour.
[01:33:37.114 --> 01:33:39.576]  Former U.S.
[01:33:39.636 --> 01:33:42.057]  Attorney Clinton could face criminal indictment.
[01:33:42.077 --> 01:33:43.678]  We're going to cover that after David Icke leaves us.
[01:33:44.418 --> 01:33:49.121]  North Korea claims to have fully successfully miniaturized a hydrogen bomb and tested it.
[01:33:49.161 --> 01:33:50.721]  They've been proven to be liars before.
[01:33:51.362 --> 01:33:55.364]  Pentagon avoids the word combat after another American soldier dies in Afghanistan.
[01:33:56.641 --> 01:33:57.341]  We're good to go.
[01:34:26.394 --> 01:34:28.474]  Will affect your social and physical credit.
[01:34:28.834 --> 01:34:34.615]  This is the model that actually was developed here, but deployed and tested in China, that David Icke was starting to get into.
[01:34:34.975 --> 01:34:40.356]  We'll talk to him in a moment, but the good news is, never lower approval ratings for government.
[01:34:41.056 --> 01:34:42.817]  Never more resistance to the system.
[01:34:42.837 --> 01:34:44.497]  You know, they push abortion.
[01:34:44.617 --> 01:34:45.757]  Abortion's unpopular now.
[01:34:46.157 --> 01:34:46.677]  All over the world.
[01:34:47.078 --> 01:34:48.558]  Was popular just 30, 40 years ago.
[01:34:48.578 --> 01:34:49.358]  It was a new trendy thing.
[01:34:49.998 --> 01:34:53.059]  Gun control was more popular than not 30, 40 years ago.
[01:34:53.119 --> 01:34:53.979]  Now it's very unpopular.
[01:34:54.719 --> 01:34:55.359]  The polls show it.
[01:34:56.468 --> 01:35:01.269]  So the good news is there is an awakening of a large group of people of every race, color, and creed happening.
[01:35:02.349 --> 01:35:04.910]  I mean, you know, we've got Matt Drudge listening pretty much every day.
[01:35:04.930 --> 01:35:06.030]  I mean, he told me he listens every day.
[01:35:06.050 --> 01:35:06.510]  I'm flattered.
[01:35:07.290 --> 01:35:14.691]  We've got, I know for a fact, a lot of the Russian high command, government people, Vladimir Putin, reportedly listens and likes the show.
[01:35:14.711 --> 01:35:15.712]  I was told this years ago.
[01:35:16.452 --> 01:35:18.672]  You shouldn't be so critical of Putin about, you know, this and that.
[01:35:18.692 --> 01:35:19.592]  You know, he likes your show.
[01:35:19.612 --> 01:35:22.653]  Then I was like, yeah, yeah, right, until I heard it from a bunch of high-level Russians.
[01:35:23.673 --> 01:35:35.844]  And now you see the type of media they have in Russia talking about vaccines will kill you, cancer is way up because of glyphosate, we're banning GMO, global warming is a global government carbon tax to destroy nation states and kill billions.
[01:35:35.904 --> 01:35:42.910]  I mean, it's not just that they're Alex Jones listeners, they are tuning into the reality.
[01:35:42.990 --> 01:35:45.112]  It makes sense to them and then they learn more.
[01:35:46.294 --> 01:35:48.015]  And then they basically get outside the box.
[01:35:48.055 --> 01:35:48.775]  It's very exciting.
[01:35:49.575 --> 01:35:58.399]  Now, speaking of outside the box, we have the new 2016 calendar in, and we've only got 10,000 of these, and we sell them at cost.
[01:35:58.459 --> 01:36:13.485]  They're $6.95, and there are literally thousands of dollars of coupons on water filtration, non-GMO seeds, shortwave radios, all the nutraceuticals, t-shirts,
[01:36:15.149 --> 01:36:15.650]  You name it.
[01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:24.037]  And yes, Leanne McAdoo, her idea as a B52 pent-up girl, and she really pulls it off well, let me tell you.
[01:36:24.918 --> 01:36:28.602]  So, you need to get it just for the coupons alone.
[01:36:29.082 --> 01:36:31.144]  InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:31.244 --> 01:36:33.646]  We sold out of the 10,000 in just about two weeks last year.
[01:36:39.670 --> 01:36:45.051]  But I hope we'll just get it to then give to friends and family, also, who may not be awake to what's happening, say, hey, here's a free calendar.
[01:36:45.431 --> 01:36:48.191]  Just like a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, we're going to end this special next week.
[01:36:48.592 --> 01:36:53.332]  Never had six months free, but I really want to get more people tuning into PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:36:53.352 --> 01:36:58.473]  20 people can use each membership, see the nightly news, all the films.
[01:36:58.533 --> 01:37:01.294]  It's a platform we have that they can't censor as easily.
[01:37:01.314 --> 01:37:03.834]  And they can shut it down.
[01:37:03.874 --> 01:37:07.315]  We had a big, big hack attacks last week, obviously, just got our Twitter back yesterday.
[01:37:07.335 --> 01:37:07.375]  So,
[01:37:09.671 --> 01:37:12.353]  Six months free right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:13.133 --> 01:37:17.856]  But the big special is 15% off everything until Friday at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:37:18.656 --> 01:37:21.698]  The hundreds and hundreds of items with promo code GIFT15.
[01:37:21.718 --> 01:37:22.178]  15% off.
[01:37:26.124 --> 01:37:26.184]  Yes.
[01:37:41.144 --> 01:37:42.265]  We're good to go.
[01:38:00.782 --> 01:38:10.547]  So Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139 and please also support our local Aminathem affiliates, support their local sponsors, become a sponsor, spread the word as well.
[01:38:10.867 --> 01:38:13.088]  Don't take it for granted that you're able to hear this.
[01:38:13.748 --> 01:38:14.789]  Don't take it for granted.
[01:38:14.849 --> 01:38:16.910]  They are pushing worldwide to censor.
[01:38:17.450 --> 01:38:19.751]  They are coming in with these systems David Icke talked about.
[01:38:20.072 --> 01:38:22.233]  He's getting blocked all over the world traveling.
[01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:25.421]  When there isn't one racist thing ever said.
[01:38:25.661 --> 01:38:27.262]  But let's say he said racist stuff.
[01:38:27.302 --> 01:38:28.442]  He should be able to travel.
[01:38:28.803 --> 01:38:30.683]  You know, again, I'm not against Muslims in general.
[01:38:30.703 --> 01:38:34.625]  I don't want to get into this, but the clash of civilizations is happening.
[01:38:34.665 --> 01:38:46.591]  To the point, Louis Faircon, the tape's coming out, we're going to put it out very soon, interviewed him two days ago, said we have to block people coming in from the Middle East because we know they're bringing terrorists in on purpose to bring in martial law.
[01:38:46.611 --> 01:38:47.571]  I mean, that's a fact.
[01:38:48.611 --> 01:38:50.312]  They took over Syria.
[01:38:50.352 --> 01:38:51.433]  They brought in the terrorists.
[01:38:52.253 --> 01:38:56.856]  And then now they're going to bring them here to demonize everybody and take everybody's freedoms.
[01:38:56.896 --> 01:39:01.780]  I mean, it's a really sophisticated problem and reaction solution situation.
[01:39:02.661 --> 01:39:03.561]  But David, it's here.
[01:39:03.621 --> 01:39:05.002]  Like you said, the shoe is dropping.
[01:39:05.022 --> 01:39:05.683]  You've got the floor.
[01:39:06.023 --> 01:39:13.549]  Please continue with your point you were getting into, how they are going to try to demonize folks, how they're going to reward others that play ball.
[01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:19.654]  But again, it's an evil spider, a monster, as you said, at the center of the web.
[01:39:20.155 --> 01:39:22.917]  You can't make a deal with this, can you, David Icke?
[01:39:24.218 --> 01:39:24.699]  Well, no.
[01:39:26.781 --> 01:39:30.124]  It's simple, what is happening.
[01:39:31.624 --> 01:39:54.322]  You are seeking to bring in a centralized global fascist, communist, whatever you like to people living in those situations, they're the same really, Orwellian global state in which you have 24-7 surveillance and your freedoms are basically zero.
[01:39:55.603 --> 01:39:56.964]  Now to bring that in
[01:39:57.970 --> 01:40:02.091]  You can't just come out and say, OK, we've had a meeting, this is what we're going to do.
[01:40:02.871 --> 01:40:08.932]  You have to create, in the public mind, the reasons why you're doing it.
[01:40:09.892 --> 01:40:14.113]  And because those reasons are not genuine, you have to make them up.
[01:40:14.193 --> 01:40:22.034]  In other words, you are bringing in your global fascist system by lying and lying and lying.
[01:40:23.214 --> 01:40:24.655]  Now, that's one side of it.
[01:40:25.175 --> 01:40:25.715]  But of course,
[01:40:27.341 --> 01:40:32.304]  What lies are very vulnerable to, to say the least, is the truth.
[01:40:33.425 --> 01:40:35.967]  So you've got a double whammy.
[01:40:36.147 --> 01:40:37.247]  You've got two fronts.
[01:40:38.408 --> 01:40:45.052]  One is to lie to the public so that you have your excuses to bring in your global system.
[01:40:45.873 --> 01:40:51.116]  And two, you've got to shut up those that are speaking the truth and thus exposing the lie.
[01:40:51.737 --> 01:40:52.978]  And that's what we're seeing.
[01:40:53.618 --> 01:40:56.520]  That's why, I mean, and this is an important point.
[01:40:57.861 --> 01:40:59.182]  Where does the real power lie?
[01:40:59.642 --> 01:41:00.502]  It lies with the truth.
[01:41:00.542 --> 01:41:01.583]  It doesn't lie with the lies.
[01:41:02.684 --> 01:41:05.685]  You can see behind me how big this room is.
[01:41:05.745 --> 01:41:13.469]  This is my little office where I do all my work and have done so for 10, 12 years, turning out the books and all the rest of it.
[01:41:15.190 --> 01:41:20.453]  And I'm currently sitting 13,000 miles away from the Australian government.
[01:41:21.413 --> 01:41:21.854]  One bloke.
[01:41:22.994 --> 01:41:24.395]  And yet they are
[01:41:25.663 --> 01:41:34.933]  Seeking to delay and delay a speaking visa, where I'm supposed to speak in a number of Australian cities in July, because they fear
[01:41:36.007 --> 01:41:38.368]  The information that I'm going to circulate.
[01:41:39.508 --> 01:41:51.511]  And Australia, I mean there was an Australian politician said in Parliament, or a video I saw this week, he is saying Australia is in a pre-police state situation.
[01:41:51.991 --> 01:41:57.073]  I would take the pre away, if you look at what's happening in Australia, with a situation
[01:41:58.013 --> 01:42:11.705]  It's another take a breath, take a step back, look at it again, in which people are being denied benefits from the government if they don't have their children vaccinated according to the government's vaccination schedule.
[01:42:12.066 --> 01:42:19.032]  Now, if anyone wants a definition of a tyranny, then give me one better than that.
[01:42:19.892 --> 01:42:22.555]  But what they don't want, because that's the lie, that's
[01:42:22.915 --> 01:42:27.459]  Bringing in the system, they don't want the truth to challenge the lie.
[01:42:27.719 --> 01:42:43.531]  And the fact that they are frightened of me coming into their country and just talking about three, four events, when I'm just one bloke, just shows the power of information.
[01:42:44.332 --> 01:42:46.694]  And I'm looking at that headline now.
[01:42:47.394 --> 01:42:52.098]  This is a point that I want to pick up from what you were talking about earlier.
[01:42:54.488 --> 01:43:06.552]  The number of people at the center of this global web who are doing this in full knowledge and awareness of what they're doing is very, very small.
[01:43:08.092 --> 01:43:14.915]  And they have to manipulate other people to play out their
[01:43:16.482 --> 01:43:33.028]  Desires their agenda called government administrators and politicians and others they have to manipulate People in uniform to impose their agenda once the laws have been passed by others and they have to
[01:43:34.505 --> 01:43:39.689]  Keep people in the dark of what is actually going on.
[01:43:40.530 --> 01:43:54.140]  And to do that, given there's 7 billion people in the world, you have to enlist, through manipulation and programming, large numbers of those people to police each other.
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:57.362]  An analogy I used many years ago is that
[01:43:59.312 --> 01:44:06.600]  People laugh at sheep because they, you know, run from the sheepdog and follow the one in front.
[01:44:07.081 --> 01:44:11.605]  But humanity in large numbers has out-sheeped the sheep!
[01:44:12.386 --> 01:44:15.590]  At least the sheep need a sheepdog to keep them in line.
[01:44:15.610 --> 01:44:18.033]  Humans keep each other in line.
[01:44:18.553 --> 01:44:24.740]  And of course that is the whole foundation of what's called political correctness.
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:29.725]  Which is the insane seeking to silence the intelligent.
[01:44:29.845 --> 01:44:30.446]  Absolutely.
[01:44:30.466 --> 01:44:31.767]  Not the intelligent in my view.
[01:44:32.187 --> 01:44:33.429]  And they're moving on every front.
[01:44:34.089 --> 01:44:34.869]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:44:34.909 --> 01:44:36.210]  And it's getting more and more extreme.
[01:44:36.230 --> 01:44:40.191]  When I read what's happening in United States universities, it's extraordinary.
[01:44:40.492 --> 01:44:46.434]  But what they're doing is recruiting the slaves to enslave the slaves.
[01:44:46.514 --> 01:44:48.195]  And this is what political correctness is.
[01:44:48.635 --> 01:44:51.536]  You start out here and you have debate.
[01:44:52.176 --> 01:45:03.706]  You have different views, you have people having access to different views and different information and having the right, oh my goodness me, they'll call the police, to make a decision on that information.
[01:45:04.146 --> 01:45:15.436]  And then political correctness is squeezing it and squeezing it in league with other situations until what's left is only the official version of everything, which is the lie.
[01:45:15.956 --> 01:45:32.863]  And what's amazing is that people who would otherwise say, oh yeah, freedom of speech, when someone says something they don't like, instead of saying, well, actually, I think that's wrong because the response is always, ban them, ban them, silence them.
[01:45:33.404 --> 01:45:43.008]  And anyone who says that, and there's many on the left who say that, of course, all the time, don't tell me you are in favor of a free society.
[01:45:43.068 --> 01:45:45.329]  Don't tell me you believe in freedom.
[01:45:45.689 --> 01:45:48.812]  Because you are a key part of the tyranny.
[01:45:49.132 --> 01:45:56.238]  Without people like you, the few in the background who are running the tyranny couldn't play the tyranny out.
[01:45:56.699 --> 01:46:01.483]  Wake up before you, in the end, become a victim of the tyranny.
[01:46:01.503 --> 01:46:02.924]  And so do your children and grandchildren.
[01:46:02.944 --> 01:46:04.085]  David, that's absolutely right.
[01:46:04.145 --> 01:46:11.474]  And again, places like MSNBC and Salon now openly say, arrest Alex Jones, shut him up.
[01:46:12.194 --> 01:46:17.500]  They go, it's great that the IRS is harassing the Tea Party and Christian groups and veterans groups.
[01:46:18.201 --> 01:46:21.883]  And auditing them, they're evil racists, they deserve to be shut down.
[01:46:21.903 --> 01:46:32.288]  A, they're not racist, but even if they were, they're on TV saying, let's persecute people, when they would have crucified Richard Nixon for doing one one thousandth of it.
[01:46:32.708 --> 01:46:36.390]  They're so totalitarian, but they call themselves liberal.
[01:46:36.410 --> 01:46:37.071]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:46:37.351 --> 01:46:41.453]  We saw great tyranny move forward under the Republicans and Bush, but now under Obama,
[01:46:42.253 --> 01:46:49.298]  Even liberal constitutional lawyers like Jonathan Turley say it's about triple what Bush did, because he can get away with so much more.
[01:46:50.239 --> 01:46:52.541]  And again, we knew there was a clash of civilizations.
[01:46:52.581 --> 01:46:54.182]  You spoke about PENAC day one.
[01:46:54.302 --> 01:46:56.044]  I spoke about it even before 9-11.
[01:46:56.804 --> 01:46:57.965]  The clash of civilizations.
[01:46:58.005 --> 01:47:01.087]  But it doesn't mean it isn't real once they start it.
[01:47:01.508 --> 01:47:08.693]  And they're bringing in radical Wahhabi Sunnis back by Saudi Arabia, who they allow to colonize the Middle East and Africa.
[01:47:09.013 --> 01:47:10.475]  They're now colonizing here.
[01:47:11.115 --> 01:47:17.253]  And we're told by the left now, in fact a German mayor and the Green Party after 35 women were raped in public.
[01:47:18.524 --> 01:47:23.928]  It translates in German to, they shouldn't dress like that, and it's their fault they got raped.
[01:47:24.789 --> 01:47:26.290]  And this is a big feminist liberal.
[01:47:26.350 --> 01:47:45.384]  So now, feminists say, Western men, where women were empowered, the best place in the world historically for women, that's bad, but radical Islam, sexual mutilation, Wahhabist cult garbage, is allied with sickening weird feminists, who are now basically saying,
[01:47:46.244 --> 01:47:54.629]  Women of Germany are like hors d'oeuvres on the table for all these military-age men pouring in with fake passports.
[01:47:54.909 --> 01:47:56.810]  They're letting planes come into the U.S.
[01:47:57.730 --> 01:47:58.671]  No one is checked.
[01:47:58.711 --> 01:48:00.892]  That's CBS News, New York Daily News.
[01:48:01.092 --> 01:48:06.975]  I mean, even leftist publications are reporting that they don't even check the ID.
[01:48:07.416 --> 01:48:13.919]  But when I fly back into the U.S., they pull me in a room and interrogate me and tear through everything I've got for political reasons.
[01:48:14.019 --> 01:48:15.160]  I mean, it's so clear.
[01:48:16.772 --> 01:48:32.742]  Well, it might be a good point to get into this whole situation with migration into Europe and also get back to this section that I'm presenting of the program.
[01:48:33.203 --> 01:48:40.928]  You see, people's beliefs in a world of programming are usually programs.
[01:48:42.537 --> 01:48:52.620]  Many years ago now, back in the 1990s, I was in the old city of Jerusalem, next to the big mosque, and I was watching some Muslim kids play football.
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:59.241]  And the old city of Jerusalem is a very small area, but it's broken up into four quarters.
[01:48:59.781 --> 01:49:03.582]  There's a Christian quarter, a Muslim quarter, a Jewish quarter, and an Armenian quarter.
[01:49:04.602 --> 01:49:10.304]  And I was looking around at these different people, and it occurred to me, the truth,
[01:49:12.651 --> 01:49:20.314]  Each of them, in this small area called the Old City of Jerusalem, had been born into one of these quarters.
[01:49:21.414 --> 01:49:35.799]  And by the age of these kids, seven, eight, were playing football, they would have a certain view of the world, a certain view of themselves, a certain view of what they call God, a certain view of spirituality, a certain view of themselves.
[01:49:36.839 --> 01:49:38.320]  Had those same kids
[01:49:39.571 --> 01:49:52.937]  being born in the Christian Quarter or the Jewish Quarter, they would at the same age have downloaded a different program and thus would have had a different view of all the things that I've just listed.
[01:49:53.738 --> 01:50:04.083]  And what we need to do is realize that we are being, and I say this to every belief, I say this to every religion, I say this to every colour and creed,
[01:50:07.643 --> 01:50:30.220]  If you put your belief first, and the need for your belief to prevail first, then you are setting yourself up, and your children up, to be played off against other beliefs that put their beliefs first, and think their beliefs must prevail first.
[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:36.110]  And you are played against each other in a massive divide and rule.
[01:50:36.871 --> 01:50:42.863]  And if we look at what's happening in Europe, see, things are never black and white, they're always shades of grey.
[01:50:43.797 --> 01:50:44.697]  Stay there, David Icke.
[01:50:44.717 --> 01:50:44.997]  Stay there.
[01:50:45.017 --> 01:50:46.778]  I want to come back and we'll talk about this.
[01:50:46.798 --> 01:50:47.118]  Look, look.
[01:50:47.418 --> 01:50:48.798]  We're against the clash of civilizations.
[01:50:48.838 --> 01:50:49.958]  We don't want to kill the Muslims.
[01:50:50.378 --> 01:50:52.119]  We understand they're playing us off against each other.
[01:50:52.539 --> 01:50:56.480]  But regardless now, they're not bringing, you know, the friendly groups in.
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:58.480]  They're bringing radicals in for a clash.
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:50:59.461]  And I know you agree, David.
[01:50:59.841 --> 01:51:00.921]  So what's behind that?
[01:51:00.961 --> 01:51:02.541]  What's coming down the road next?
[01:51:03.141 --> 01:51:04.442]  I'm Alex Jones with David Icke.
[01:51:04.462 --> 01:51:05.662]  DavidIcke.com is his site.
[01:51:05.962 --> 01:51:08.783]  PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com are our sites.
[01:51:09.103 --> 01:51:09.603]  Spread the word.
[01:51:10.763 --> 01:51:13.524]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:51:13.825 --> 01:51:16.426]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:51:16.446 --> 01:51:16.886]  Croix River.
[01:51:17.186 --> 01:51:19.207]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:51:19.427 --> 01:51:22.149]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:51:22.389 --> 01:51:22.909]  His excuse?
[01:51:23.269 --> 01:51:24.330]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:51:24.610 --> 01:51:25.891]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:51:26.211 --> 01:51:31.714]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[01:51:31.974 --> 01:51:32.714]  Don't wait.
[01:51:33.014 --> 01:51:35.375]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now.

[01:52:40.037 --> 01:52:41.518]  Are you looking to sell body armor?

[01:53:02.294 --> 01:53:04.375]  Or go to KDArmor.com.
[01:53:04.455 --> 01:53:05.096]  Come and take it.
[01:53:10.342 --> 01:53:13.005]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[01:53:13.085 --> 01:53:16.569]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[01:53:17.768 --> 01:53:20.949]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[01:53:21.269 --> 01:53:26.352]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[01:53:26.692 --> 01:53:27.912]  How is this even possible?
[01:53:28.192 --> 01:53:35.515]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[01:53:35.735 --> 01:53:43.138]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[01:53:43.379 --> 01:53:46.580]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[01:53:46.860 --> 01:53:54.262]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[01:53:54.662 --> 01:53:57.363]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[01:53:57.823 --> 01:54:01.984]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to greens75.com.
[01:54:02.004 --> 01:54:02.624]  That's greens75.com.
[01:54:02.644 --> 01:54:03.044]  Greens75.com.
[01:54:18.246 --> 01:54:22.247]  The GOP is scrambling for response to Obama's gun control actions.
[01:54:22.267 --> 01:54:24.508]  Well, led by the Speaker of the House.
[01:54:24.528 --> 01:54:25.948]  You know, they'll drop the ball and do nothing.
[01:54:25.988 --> 01:54:27.729]  I mean, impeachment is the only answer.
[01:54:28.149 --> 01:54:31.270]  The President came out and said, Congress better get in line with me.
[01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:32.970]  I'm doing all this with executive action.
[01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:38.132]  National registries, no-fly list, not letting you have guns.
[01:54:38.192 --> 01:54:40.152]  I mean, the no-fly list is pure tyranny.
[01:54:41.372 --> 01:54:42.233]  Doesn't keep us safe.
[01:54:42.473 --> 01:54:42.893]  By the way,
[01:54:44.082 --> 01:54:59.451]  Getting into this whole Muslim issue, I'm the guy, before 9-11 happened, that came out and exposed it and said it's a plan to invade the Middle East and enslave, and they kick out all the moderate leaders, the women go to college and they're freer, and they, you know, Saudi Arabia's involved in the attacks, so we attack Iraq.
[01:54:59.771 --> 01:55:12.519]  I mean, I know where David's going to go with this, because he wants to bring all of humanity together, and so do I. That said, some of the greatest tyranny in the world is Saudi Arabian Wahhabist versions of Sunni Islam.
[01:55:14.171 --> 01:55:16.014]  And I know David's traveled the world.
[01:55:16.074 --> 01:55:18.337]  I'm going to get his take on this, but I just want to be clear on this.
[01:55:19.338 --> 01:55:23.544]  We tried to stop this clash of civilizations so they would then flood us with these people.
[01:55:23.884 --> 01:55:25.827]  And the argument is, well, we bombed them, now they're here.
[01:55:26.508 --> 01:55:29.011]  This isn't really the Iraqis and folks or the Christians.
[01:55:29.031 --> 01:55:29.772]  They're not letting them in.
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:34.562]  These are the people, the pilgrims that went to invade Syria, that got their butts kicked.
[01:55:34.962 --> 01:55:35.842]  They're now coming here.
[01:55:35.962 --> 01:55:37.743]  And that's what the numbers show.
[01:55:38.163 --> 01:55:43.685]  So I'm asking David Icke, A, if he agrees with that, B, what he thinks the big master plan is with all this.
[01:55:43.705 --> 01:55:49.367]  Because David Icke has shown he can really predict how this stuff is going to fall, how the dominoes are going to fall.
[01:55:49.727 --> 01:55:55.330]  His new book available at DavidIcke.com gets into finding the true self.
[01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:56.210]  We'll talk about that more.
[01:55:56.710 --> 01:56:00.952]  I want to get back to this fact that it's not black and white.
[01:56:09.461 --> 01:56:19.949]  And we have in the Middle East, and I've been there a number of times, some of the nicest, most peaceful people you'll ever meet in your life.
[01:56:19.989 --> 01:56:23.811]  Some of the most friendly, some of the most courteous and decent people.
[01:56:24.392 --> 01:56:30.496]  You also have in the Middle East some of the most monumental, unspeakable evil
[01:56:31.437 --> 01:56:48.689]  Involved in any country in the world, and I'm talking not just about Saudi Arabia, though that's one of them, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, all these countries who are working in league with the United States and Europe to bring about catastrophe in the Middle East.
[01:56:48.769 --> 01:56:55.554]  And I was writing many years ago now about the plan to divide the Sunnis against the Shia.
[01:56:56.034 --> 01:56:58.476]  You wrote 15 years ago about the plan to start a civil war.
[01:56:59.229 --> 01:57:01.471]  Yeah, and this is what's happening.
[01:57:02.952 --> 01:57:08.717]  Once you realise the game, apparent contradictions make absolute sense.
[01:57:09.658 --> 01:57:22.988]  Because what you would think is, the people like Cameron and Obama and all these other people, who are condemning dictatorships, though they run them virtually, and violence,
[01:57:23.889 --> 01:57:37.064]  Who say we must bomb Syria and Libya and Iraq to get rid of tyrants, are in bed with tyrants in Bahrain, in Saudi Arabia, and people go...
[01:57:38.519 --> 01:57:39.300]  I don't understand.
[01:57:39.340 --> 01:57:40.121]  That's hypocrisy.
[01:57:40.181 --> 01:57:47.748]  But it is hypocrisy if you've got a mind of your own and you're coming from a position of wanting a better world.
[01:57:48.388 --> 01:57:56.976]  But if you're coming from understanding the game, they are in bed with whoever is supporting the agenda.
[01:57:57.877 --> 01:57:59.218]  That we're talking about.
[01:57:59.759 --> 01:58:04.103]  And so they will want to bomb Assad because they want rid of him.
[01:58:04.143 --> 01:58:07.066]  They wanted rid of Gaddafi and etc.
[01:58:07.426 --> 01:58:15.214]  And they actually, far from bombing, they are selling arms to Saudi Arabia, this truly evil place.
[01:58:15.794 --> 01:58:22.156]  I spent eight weeks there back in the 70s in a thing to do with football.
[01:58:22.216 --> 01:58:26.457]  And I only lasted eight weeks because I thought this place is so appalling.
[01:58:26.477 --> 01:58:28.597]  The way that people are treated is so appalling.
[01:58:30.058 --> 01:58:32.859]  The royal family here, they were not royal at all.
[01:58:32.899 --> 01:58:33.959]  They're fake royals.
[01:58:33.999 --> 01:58:34.999]  They just made it up.
[01:58:35.479 --> 01:58:39.380]  I mean, they were actually caravan bandits, so they were actually sex slavers.
[01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:40.621]  They were sex slavers.
[01:58:40.741 --> 01:58:41.461]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:58:41.741 --> 01:58:45.827]  We're going to come right back in 70 seconds, looking at the big picture here.
[01:58:46.087 --> 01:58:48.530]  And by the way, they just announced they've got Stinger missiles.
[01:58:48.791 --> 01:58:50.453]  Oh, but no mention of who gave it to them.
[01:58:50.873 --> 01:58:52.095]  That's in mainstream news.
[01:58:52.135 --> 01:58:53.437]  We told you that was coming next.
[01:58:53.457 --> 01:58:53.937]  Stay with us.

[02:00:15.056 --> 02:00:30.684]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:33.197 --> 02:00:39.380]  David Iceweather has said over 20 minutes and I'm going to cover news for 40 minutes and then David Knight is hosting the fourth hour today.
[02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:44.882]  I'm going to get back into the unprecedented attack on the Bill of Rights, the press, free speech, the Second Amendment.
[02:00:45.942 --> 02:00:50.124]  I feel bad when I talk about it because I'm not making a big enough deal out of it.
[02:00:50.144 --> 02:00:51.665]  We're just kind of calmly reporting on it.
[02:00:51.725 --> 02:00:52.345]  It's crazy.
[02:00:53.405 --> 02:00:56.707]  But David Iceweather, this is a five-minute segment, long segment coming up after that.
[02:00:57.167 --> 02:01:00.208]  He wanted to get into the fact that
[02:01:02.794 --> 02:01:06.876]  In many of these radical Muslim countries, if women are unattended, they're fair game to be raped.
[02:01:07.256 --> 02:01:09.917]  If the woman then complains, she's executed in Saudi Arabia.
[02:01:09.957 --> 02:01:12.138]  So, we're basically allowed to rape women in Saudi Arabia.
[02:01:12.598 --> 02:01:15.560]  And a lot of these folks are running around Germany, and the left thinks it's cute!
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:19.881]  Uh, they're actually, the mayors are saying, don't wear short skirts, you know, it's your fault.
[02:01:20.862 --> 02:01:22.883]  Uh, but I mean, can you imagine if a German did this?
[02:01:22.923 --> 02:01:25.404]  And the media even spins it and says, German men are doing it!
[02:01:25.744 --> 02:01:30.906]  But you were getting into the, uh, waves of folks being brought into Europe, and we'll show some of the footage of the waves.
[02:01:31.426 --> 02:01:32.206]  Millions of people.
[02:01:32.687 --> 02:01:33.167]  Uh, David Icke.
[02:01:34.192 --> 02:01:35.993]  Yeah, I mean the question is why is it happening?
[02:01:36.053 --> 02:01:50.103]  I mean if you research this conspiracy for not very long, you realize that it is like a room of dominoes in a line and you push one domino down and that creates the next domino to fall.
[02:01:50.904 --> 02:02:03.073]  So we've had this situation in the Middle East where we've had all this bombing and destruction and chaos and catastrophe externally created by the United States, NATO, Britain.
[02:02:04.036 --> 02:02:07.797]  And this has forced large numbers of people to leave.
[02:02:09.038 --> 02:02:25.262]  And this wave into Europe of genuine people who deserve our help because of the situation that the West has put them in, has been joined by vast numbers of other people who are not refugees but are seeking to get into Europe.
[02:02:25.442 --> 02:02:28.243]  And it's being allowed to happen for this reason.
[02:02:29.263 --> 02:02:30.804]  And it's been long planned for this reason.
[02:02:33.049 --> 02:02:40.116]  They want a world government, a world central bank, world army, and world currency, etc.
[02:02:40.637 --> 02:02:44.181]  And under the world government, they want these super states.
[02:02:44.241 --> 02:02:50.928]  They want the European Union, of course, the American Union, the Pacific Union, all these super states under the world government.
[02:02:51.588 --> 02:03:01.915]  And these super states are designed not to be countries any longer, but to be broken up into regions, subordinate regions that are easy to control.
[02:03:02.235 --> 02:03:08.479]  You've talked about this in relation to the United States and North America and its plan for the world.
[02:03:08.559 --> 02:03:21.028]  Now, the biggest resistance to the breakup and ending of sovereignty is a sense of national identity, a sense of distinct culture.
[02:03:22.409 --> 02:03:45.872]  And what is happening, and it's been happening for a long time, I mean, just before I mention this, it came out a few years ago that during the Blair administration, it came out in documents and an insider speaking out, that they had set out to allow unfettered immigration into Britain.
[02:03:47.043 --> 02:03:48.864]  Not to help the immigrants.
[02:03:49.464 --> 02:03:52.206]  They were pawns in the game, though we didn't realize it.
[02:03:52.786 --> 02:04:02.330]  But to, quote, change the face of humans, of British society, to a point where it would never go back to what it was before.
[02:04:02.430 --> 02:04:03.651]  Well, that's Peter Sutherland.
[02:04:03.691 --> 02:04:10.815]  He even wrote in the BBC that Europeans are bad and this is to end Europeans being homogenous for balkanization purposes.
[02:04:11.435 --> 02:04:12.916]  This is all connected.
[02:04:14.316 --> 02:04:32.401]  Look at Europe, Alex, and you'll look at a country that has an enormously strong sense of its culture, sense of itself, sense of its uniqueness, sense of its history, and what you're looking at is Germany.
[02:04:33.701 --> 02:04:46.549]  And the resistance to the end of Germany, which they want down the line, and the end of the German culture would be absolutely massive if they knew that was going on.
[02:04:47.249 --> 02:04:53.033]  And the idea is, not just in Germany, but that's why Germany has been really picked out in this, what's happening.
[02:04:53.053 --> 02:04:53.994]  Stay there, this is key, sir.
[02:04:54.014 --> 02:04:55.054]  You're absolutely on target.
[02:04:55.074 --> 02:04:56.695]  AmazingInfoDavidIke.com.
[02:04:56.976 --> 02:04:58.136]  The new book, you can find it there.
[02:04:58.456 --> 02:04:58.857]  This is it.
[02:04:59.477 --> 02:05:02.340]  Germany runs basically and funds all of the EU now.
[02:05:02.861 --> 02:05:09.288]  The EU was always designed in their own words to implode Europe once it got control and then fold it into a larger world government.
[02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:17.047]  The Obama administration is pushing for the largest gun grab in American history.
[02:05:17.227 --> 02:05:21.151]  We're also taking steps to make the background check system more efficient.
[02:05:21.491 --> 02:05:25.195]  And we're going to bring an outdated background check system into the 21st century.
[02:05:25.435 --> 02:05:29.740]  Anyone critical of the government could have their Second Amendment rights taken away.
[02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:45.791]  Simply if psychologists diagnose them with what they are calling oppositional defiant disorder, which the American Psychiatric Association describes as a defiant, disobedient, and hostile behavior toward authority.
[02:05:46.051 --> 02:05:53.917]  Other measures will allow doctors to report patients to the FBI and RFID tracking with smart guns.
[02:05:54.157 --> 02:05:55.838]  We're gonna boost gun safety technology.
[02:05:56.078 --> 02:05:58.839]  We need to develop new technologies that make guns safer.
[02:05:58.859 --> 02:06:06.243]  If we can set it up so you can't unlock your phone unless you got the right fingerprint, why can't we do the same thing for our guns?
[02:06:06.683 --> 02:06:09.865]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:10.345 --> 02:06:17.229]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.

[02:07:14.292 --> 02:07:15.052]  Into lore.

[02:07:24.881 --> 02:07:29.465]  That's a little too epic, that Hollywood action-adventure-science-fiction voice I'm using.
[02:07:29.485 --> 02:07:37.812]  But quite frankly, that's how I feel like I should be talking about what happens when your body actually gets the real, natural nutrients it needs.

[02:08:04.642 --> 02:08:06.083]  I can't help but get excited.
[02:08:06.143 --> 02:08:06.784]  Get healthy!
[02:08:06.964 --> 02:08:07.745]  Fight the globalists!

[02:08:08.846 --> 02:08:09.587]  Yeah!
[02:08:21.159 --> 02:08:22.581]  This is our land.
[02:08:25.743 --> 02:08:27.424]  These are our people.
[02:08:27.484 --> 02:08:29.024]  The workers.
[02:08:29.065 --> 02:08:29.805]  The strivers.
[02:08:29.845 --> 02:08:31.165]  The builders.
[02:08:31.245 --> 02:08:32.846]  These are our people.
[02:08:38.255 --> 02:08:39.415]  This is from 1984.
[02:08:39.475 --> 02:08:42.236]  Who are they?
[02:08:42.396 --> 02:08:45.136]  They are the dark armies.
[02:08:45.236 --> 02:08:49.197]  The dark murdering armies whose only honor is atrocity.
[02:08:49.237 --> 02:08:50.017]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:08:50.057 --> 02:08:51.998]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:09:07.298 --> 02:09:10.784]  He did a historic big interview with Lewis Farrakhan two days ago.
[02:09:10.804 --> 02:09:12.968]  I'll give you details at the bottom of the hour.
[02:09:12.988 --> 02:09:15.412]  Detailing when that's going to be released.
[02:09:15.452 --> 02:09:16.855]  It will be a big news maker.
[02:09:20.461 --> 02:09:22.802]  Farrakhan said, quote, he's changed in the interview too.
[02:09:22.982 --> 02:09:24.183]  It's big.
[02:09:25.123 --> 02:09:32.906]  But a lot of people are really assessing, reassessing things happening in the world because everybody can feel that huge change is upon us.
[02:09:33.206 --> 02:09:34.367]  Some of it good, some of it bad.
[02:09:34.607 --> 02:09:38.609]  But if good people don't get involved, evil will triumph in this time of change.
[02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:45.792]  David Icke was getting into the fact, really deep stuff that's so on target from my research about why they're flooding Europe.
[02:09:46.943 --> 02:09:54.410]  Destroy the sovereignty of the countries, even telling them the soccer teams can't be named after countries anymore because nationalism itself is bad.
[02:09:54.810 --> 02:10:06.220]  Then you bring in groups to break up the country, make it all about ethnic stuff, the opposite of multiculturalism, and then annex the Middle East in the name of controlling the migrant floods and invade more countries.
[02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:08.522]  Now David Icke just went over all that.
[02:10:08.842 --> 02:10:10.604]  What comes next after that, David Icke?
[02:10:11.550 --> 02:10:28.645]  Well, I think the other point I want to make is that people have been taken aback, not least Germans, at what Chancellor Merkel was doing when this great flood of migrants began.
[02:10:30.047 --> 02:10:37.834]  She opened the doors to Germany without any question, without any policy, without anything.
[02:10:38.966 --> 02:10:41.609]  And people in Germany were like, well, what are you doing?
[02:10:41.629 --> 02:10:42.950]  What are you doing?
[02:10:43.650 --> 02:10:45.932]  Well, what she's doing is this.
[02:10:46.693 --> 02:10:56.721]  Chancellor Merkel is a 100% owned and willingly owned asset of this hidden hand.
[02:10:57.762 --> 02:11:03.968]  And the reason that she's done what she's done is because the agenda demanded it.
[02:11:05.091 --> 02:11:13.674]  And because of that, she has acted and reacted, or hasn't, to what has happened in the way that she has.
[02:11:14.434 --> 02:11:21.997]  And the other point, Alex, is, again and again, when you study how The Hidden Hand works,
[02:11:23.052 --> 02:11:33.956]  It plays one group of victims, or one group of stooges, whatever you want to call them, against another to create the divide and rule.
[02:11:33.996 --> 02:11:36.157]  And they, see, again we're back to the dominoes.
[02:11:36.237 --> 02:11:40.058]  If this domino goes down, this domino is going to go down, and that means this will happen.
[02:11:40.438 --> 02:11:42.159]  If you do A, B will happen.
[02:11:42.179 --> 02:11:51.702]  And I never want you to think like that, but in their own books they admit they're rigging 20, 30, 50, 100 year plans, so break down the rest of the plan where this goes from here.
[02:11:52.247 --> 02:11:52.968]  Well, exactly.
[02:11:53.549 --> 02:12:05.044]  And so the other point of the migration is they know that certain things are going to happen, because if you get a large number of people from one culture into another,
[02:12:07.287 --> 02:12:12.151]  Then you're going to have some very nice people and you're going to have some very unnice people.
[02:12:12.491 --> 02:12:13.352]  That's what happens.
[02:12:13.913 --> 02:12:35.491]  And as things happen, and we're seeing some of them now, that the hidden hand you would happen, you're obviously going to get an angry reaction from the population, the German population, and you're going to create conflict, you're going to create resentment, and you're going to create divide and rule conflict in Europe.
[02:12:36.131 --> 02:12:41.414]  Between those who are coming in and those that are already there.
[02:12:41.654 --> 02:12:47.957]  And some of the decent people in both groups are going to be caught up in the crossfire.
[02:12:48.617 --> 02:12:53.259]  And so the more chaos you can have, order out of chaos,
[02:12:55.100 --> 02:13:03.988]  And the more you can break down a sense of culture, a sense of unique culture, that together justifies a number of things.
[02:13:04.089 --> 02:13:10.995]  It justifies a police state to stop the... That's my next point.
[02:13:11.035 --> 02:13:13.818]  Let me interject this, David, because I want you to continue, but this is so important.
[02:13:13.838 --> 02:13:14.679]  It's where I was going next.
[02:13:15.539 --> 02:13:22.063]  They don't want us to ever think about connecting dots or dominoes because if we ever have common sense, it's over.
[02:13:22.703 --> 02:13:36.612]  They bring in the radical Muslims, they let them attack, and then they say we're going to take your free speech away across Europe because this happened and arrest nationalists and arrest Le Pen.
[02:13:38.010 --> 02:13:45.152]  In a response to them bringing them in, and the same European governments backed destabilizing the Middle East, and are involved.
[02:13:45.172 --> 02:14:03.416]  So at every level they're doing it, and then now they bring even more groups, and as we said when I gave them thousands of Stinger missiles a few years ago, they have articles now in the London Independent going, oh, now they have Stinger missiles from the West, but it's, but then it talks about how they're fixing some of the old ones and might make them work.
[02:14:03.496 --> 02:14:04.556]  Oh, I love that one.
[02:14:04.596 --> 02:14:05.097]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:14:05.217 --> 02:14:06.557]  As the cover story,
[02:14:06.977 --> 02:14:08.679]  For them now shooting down the airliners.
[02:14:08.739 --> 02:14:17.066]  I mean, they're literally running it all, our governments are, and they never get in trouble because none of the media will point out how ridiculous it is.
[02:14:17.106 --> 02:14:18.828]  David Icke, sorry, I'm ranting.
[02:14:19.228 --> 02:14:27.976]  It's a script and, you know, there are some journalists who are manipulating in full knowledge of what they're doing, but they're the minority.
[02:14:28.316 --> 02:14:29.918]  We're back to the program again.
[02:14:30.598 --> 02:14:51.809]  If you don't see how the dots connect, if you don't see how the dominoes fall onto the next domino, if you can't see that it is pre-planned and has been planned to play out like this for a very, very long time, and you're a journalist, all you can see is dots.
[02:14:51.949 --> 02:14:53.810]  You can't see pictures.
[02:14:53.870 --> 02:14:55.030]  Let me expand on that.
[02:14:55.090 --> 02:14:56.171]  I've got to interrupt because it's so key.
[02:14:56.191 --> 02:14:56.831]  You're absolutely right.
[02:14:57.271 --> 02:14:59.833]  I got up this morning, saw the headline,
[02:15:00.797 --> 02:15:21.868]  And instantly knew that it was a cover story for the thousands of missiles, and that it would talk about them repairing the ones the West gave them, so they make the story about repairing them, and make it look like they developed Stinger missiles, but then you read the third paragraph, it admits they've given them the Stinger missiles.
[02:15:21.948 --> 02:15:24.689]  I mean, but I didn't even need to read it!
[02:15:25.029 --> 02:15:27.971]  I'm so used, just like you, I'm so used to their lies,
[02:15:28.291 --> 02:15:31.033]  I see the headline, and I know what the spin's gonna be.
[02:15:31.373 --> 02:15:33.134]  That's not being a conspiracy theorist.
[02:15:33.175 --> 02:15:35.196]  It's knowing how they operate.
[02:15:35.236 --> 02:15:35.956]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:15:36.457 --> 02:15:41.280]  Yeah, well, of course, the biggest problem is the coincidence theorist.
[02:15:41.320 --> 02:15:42.141]  That's the worst one.
[02:15:42.681 --> 02:15:43.782]  It's all a coincidence.
[02:15:43.842 --> 02:15:45.263]  I mean, it's a head shaker.
[02:15:45.723 --> 02:15:48.605]  But we're back to the lie and the truth.
[02:15:49.506 --> 02:15:57.153]  So, you've got the lie narrative for what's happening, and you've got to suppress the truth narrative.
[02:15:57.513 --> 02:16:10.665]  And this is why the man-child, who is Mark Zuckerberg, and this outrageously censorship-laden organisation, Facebook, was caught on a live mic at the UN, with who?
[02:16:10.685 --> 02:16:12.106]  Chancellor Merkel!
[02:16:13.487 --> 02:16:21.890]  Talking about suppressing posts that are saying what's happening in Germany, because it doesn't fit the narrative.
[02:16:21.930 --> 02:16:22.991]  This is the whole point.
[02:16:23.391 --> 02:16:40.439]  So if you're Google, or you're Facebook, or any of these organizations, who are all strands in the web, ultimately, I mean, if Mark Zuckerberg is the one running Facebook, ultimately, then I live in a bloody igloo.
[02:16:41.559 --> 02:16:55.143]  And so, you're seeing this suppression of anything that... I mean, I've had many things censored by Facebook, including a posting of a story about Sandy Hook.
[02:16:56.284 --> 02:17:05.147]  And it's because if you're challenging the official narrative, you're challenging the lie on which the transformation of society is being justified.
[02:17:05.387 --> 02:17:08.768]  This is what's happening, and people should realize this.
[02:17:09.748 --> 02:17:19.478]  If it's in the mainstream, it's almost certainly a lie, even though the journalists themselves might not know because they're so ignorant of what's going on.
[02:17:20.018 --> 02:17:31.550]  And if things are being censored by Facebook, it's not out of... I mean, when you see some of the things that happen on social media and that are posted, the idea that it's to protect the sensibilities of Facebook...
[02:17:31.650 --> 02:17:42.458]  Key stuff, like when I interviewed Navy SEAL families, like within weeks of Benghazi and other things, when I interview key people breaking stuff, it just gets censored and blocked.
[02:17:42.798 --> 02:17:48.283]  They're definitely blocking key info that exposes their agenda, as you just said, David.
[02:17:49.178 --> 02:17:52.239]  And that just shows you where the power is.
[02:17:52.779 --> 02:17:54.899]  They are terrified of the truth.
[02:17:55.319 --> 02:17:58.620]  And so what we need to do is keep banging it out there.
[02:17:58.660 --> 02:18:04.882]  That's why I'm going on this world speaking tour, starting later this year, and it's open-ended.
[02:18:05.562 --> 02:18:15.564]  I am going to give every fibre of my being and do everything possible in the next, well beyond, but certainly in the next three years, because this
[02:18:16.204 --> 02:18:19.245]  This is the eye of the storm, this is the eye of the hurricane.
[02:18:19.345 --> 02:18:32.047]  These are the three years where we can start to make fundamental impacts upon this agenda so that the house of cards that it is will fall.
[02:18:32.087 --> 02:18:38.709]  Because it's a house of cards because A. it's based on lies and B. it's based on a programmed population.
[02:18:39.389 --> 02:19:02.826]  Once the people start to break out of what I call phantom self and start to see beyond it, start to realize it's a program and they've been programmed and their perception of everything has actually been downloaded so that they'll see the world the way that the agenda demands, once they start to connect the dots and see that actually it's not all random, it's all connected, then the house of cards starts to fall.
[02:19:02.886 --> 02:19:05.568]  Because although it seems so powerful,
[02:19:06.028 --> 02:19:06.388]  I agree.
[02:19:17.912 --> 02:19:19.834]  David, we've got a few minutes left here.
[02:19:19.854 --> 02:19:25.219]  I'm going to skip this network break because this is so important today to go over all this information.
[02:19:25.839 --> 02:19:31.705]  Undoubtedly, the point of emergence when the whole program starts coming out in the open has really begun in the last year.
[02:19:32.105 --> 02:19:33.767]  It's accelerating exponentially.
[02:19:33.867 --> 02:19:35.088]  I look at the acceleration.
[02:19:36.349 --> 02:19:50.260]  It's going to be crazy within 10, 12, 14 months, obviously, but Newtonian physics is accurate in this plane of existence that forever action, there's an opposite, you know, and equal reaction, basically, and or equal and opposite reaction.
[02:19:51.101 --> 02:20:00.648]  And so I would have never thought, you talked about decompartmentalizing police officers, military, you know, how they're a perfect example of compartmentalization, protecting their own enslavers, but
[02:20:01.926 --> 02:20:10.370]  Particularly, as you said, people on the inside going public, in media, in government, in the military, in the police, because they really see how evil it is.
[02:20:11.110 --> 02:20:17.773]  And because you and I and countless others have helped decompartmentalize them, that's really going to give the system a problem.
[02:20:17.813 --> 02:20:19.554]  But then I read white papers that are public.
[02:20:20.154 --> 02:20:23.535]  And the globalists admit, oh, we're just going to automation and technocracy.
[02:20:23.876 --> 02:20:35.720]  They believe that's their holy grail, where everything's going to be robots, everything's going to be automated, everything's going to be smart meters, self-driving cars, shelf-controlled guns, where you don't have a choice.
[02:20:36.281 --> 02:20:44.264]  And that's going to be their answer is this total robotic world that, quote, makes it all convenient, but really takes all human power away.
[02:20:44.564 --> 02:20:48.566]  And that's the attacks on farms and ranches and Amish and outdoor
[02:20:49.466 --> 02:20:50.347]  Farmer's markets.
[02:20:50.827 --> 02:20:54.650]  I'm really getting to the point of it's true, but we can't just be hippies.
[02:20:55.070 --> 02:20:56.751]  We've got to have people that are on the land.
[02:20:56.791 --> 02:21:08.699]  We've got to fight in the cities politically, but we've got to work and at least support people that are on the land and support and vote with our money to never support big globalist operations and literally
[02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:14.622]  Keep our children with other like-minded people and understand we are in an occupied planet.
[02:21:14.962 --> 02:21:16.222]  I mean, it's like Childhood's End.
[02:21:16.242 --> 02:21:17.362]  I'm not saying it's aliens.
[02:21:17.402 --> 02:21:19.363]  I mean, you're saying it's interdimensional, whatever.
[02:21:19.443 --> 02:21:19.743]  Probably.
[02:21:19.763 --> 02:21:20.983]  I mean, it's just so obvious.
[02:21:21.203 --> 02:21:22.044]  It's out to destroy us.
[02:21:22.264 --> 02:21:22.984]  It's anti-human.
[02:21:23.784 --> 02:21:24.624]  Archetype whatever.
[02:21:24.724 --> 02:21:25.865]  It's evil aliens want to get us.
[02:21:25.925 --> 02:21:26.385]  I mean, you know.
[02:21:26.445 --> 02:21:27.125]  I'm not saying that.
[02:21:27.165 --> 02:21:27.825]  You're saying that.
[02:21:28.165 --> 02:21:30.186]  The point is, is that it doesn't matter.
[02:21:30.646 --> 02:21:31.326]  It's the same thing.
[02:21:31.366 --> 02:21:32.747]  They want to abort planet Earth.
[02:21:33.007 --> 02:21:33.947]  They want to play God.
[02:21:33.987 --> 02:21:35.027]  They want everything ugly.
[02:21:35.207 --> 02:21:36.748]  They want to mutate every species.
[02:21:37.248 --> 02:21:42.029]  They might as well be, you know, whatever from the ninth dimension, because they're that anti-human.
[02:21:42.049 --> 02:21:43.529]  The elites say they're a new species.
[02:21:43.829 --> 02:21:45.190]  They say they're splitting off from us.
[02:21:45.210 --> 02:21:49.891]  They say, I don't believe in God, but I'm about to become God, you know, if you're Ray Kurzweil.
[02:21:50.311 --> 02:21:51.731]  This is their big conferences.
[02:21:51.831 --> 02:21:53.592]  I know rich billionaires, as I'm sure you do.
[02:21:53.892 --> 02:21:55.312]  I know powerful Hollywood people.
[02:21:55.672 --> 02:21:56.292]  And they've come to me.
[02:21:56.312 --> 02:21:58.593]  In fact, I'm going to look at the camera and tell the viewers this, then go back to David Icke.
[02:22:00.473 --> 02:22:03.214]  I'm talking to billionaires, Hollywood stars.
[02:22:03.314 --> 02:22:04.634]  You've heard a lot of them here on air, folks.
[02:22:04.734 --> 02:22:05.714]  I don't make this stuff up.
[02:22:05.794 --> 02:22:09.975]  I tell you, Putin listens to the show, you know, watches, he's willing to get an interview.
[02:22:10.315 --> 02:22:12.096]  I tell you, Matt Drudge, listener, boom, he shows up.
[02:22:12.116 --> 02:22:14.096]  I mean, we don't, you know, Louis Furcon, huge listener.
[02:22:14.116 --> 02:22:16.017]  You're like, well, Louis Furcon, yeah, and he's changing.
[02:22:16.037 --> 02:22:17.497]  I'm going to wait until you see the interview.
[02:22:18.263 --> 02:22:27.929]  The point is, is that I talk to a lot of people, though, and they go, listen, I knew you 20 years ago or 15 years ago, and I thought some of what you're saying was true and liked you and thought you were funny.
[02:22:28.649 --> 02:22:37.174]  But listen, I've had elites come to me and say, if you want life extension or you want to be part of the breakaway civilization, you go along with the system and you shut up.
[02:22:37.855 --> 02:22:38.755]  And they get scared.
[02:22:38.795 --> 02:22:39.756]  They go, it's all real.
[02:22:40.036 --> 02:22:44.539]  And the head of a major media empire or the head of a major bank will go, you're damn right, it's real.
[02:22:45.279 --> 02:22:46.400]  We're bringing in world government.
[02:22:46.420 --> 02:22:47.600]  We're going to reduce population.
[02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:51.042]  You better join the right team and you stay away from that Alex Jones.
[02:22:51.662 --> 02:22:55.604]  I mean, they kind of take the mask off and these people are scared.
[02:22:55.664 --> 02:23:09.410]  So, so David Ike, they've gotten to the point now in Hollywood, especially because you see Kurt Russell go in public and all these other people, they are going to folks and literally basically threatening their families, but then saying, or
[02:23:10.350 --> 02:23:14.694]  Come get on the spaceship, and I'm not saying, they don't say spaceship, but it's like the high-tech reservation.
[02:23:14.914 --> 02:23:36.272]  We've got the high-tech, we're gonna be gods, you know, we're gonna, I mean, you see it in the headlines, the elite are obsessed with living forever, world government, it's all out in the open now, and they're going to the big culture icons that could really change things, and they're telling them, and some of these icons say, I'm not gonna join you, and they go, fine, but you keep your mouth shut or we'll kill you like we killed your daddy.
[02:23:37.242 --> 02:23:38.944]  I'm going to leave it at that point with that famous group.
[02:23:39.304 --> 02:23:42.807]  But, I mean, that's how hardcore this has gotten, David.
[02:23:42.847 --> 02:23:43.187]  Go ahead.
[02:23:43.387 --> 02:23:45.028]  We've got six minutes until break and we'll let you go.
[02:23:45.068 --> 02:23:45.849]  Thank you for the time, sir.
[02:23:46.730 --> 02:23:46.990]  Right.
[02:23:47.050 --> 02:23:50.252]  Well, crikey, I could talk for hours now.
[02:23:51.213 --> 02:23:56.778]  What we're looking at is what I've called for years now the Hunger Games Society.
[02:23:57.537 --> 02:24:02.960]  Where you've got a tiny elite of less than 1% that control everything.
[02:24:03.260 --> 02:24:06.822]  All politics, all government, all money, etc.
[02:24:06.922 --> 02:24:07.502]  World Army.
[02:24:08.543 --> 02:24:20.129]  And you have a mass population that survive in servitude and in deprivation and in slavery.
[02:24:20.769 --> 02:24:26.312]  And I'm talking about people who this minute might call themselves well off and it doesn't affect me.
[02:24:27.757 --> 02:24:45.522]  And in between those two is the strata of the police state, which is there to mercilessly, this is why they're recruiting more and more psychopaths, to mercilessly impose the will of the less than 1% upon the mass of human slaves.
[02:24:46.922 --> 02:24:50.463]  And a key part of this is the assimilation.
[02:24:51.024 --> 02:24:55.085]  And you've brought up the topic transhumanism.
[02:24:56.005 --> 02:25:09.012]  Transhumanism, if you listen to people like Kurzweil, you are told that transhumanism, putting technology inside the body, what they're calling implantables, will make us superhuman.
[02:25:09.052 --> 02:25:09.552]  No it won't.
[02:25:09.812 --> 02:25:11.073]  It will make us super robots.
[02:25:11.633 --> 02:25:13.614]  It will make us super subhuman.
[02:25:14.855 --> 02:25:24.940]  And so what is happening, and I go into this in The Phantom Self in some detail, and the chapter I write about this I think is the most important chapter I've ever written in any book,
[02:25:26.120 --> 02:25:32.103]  We're seeing what I call the totalitarian tiptoe of assimilating human minds into technology.
[02:25:32.843 --> 02:25:35.665]  It's one major, major stepping stone to this.
[02:25:36.753 --> 02:25:42.055]  Is what is now a global addiction to smartphone technology.
[02:25:42.655 --> 02:25:46.396]  Where we're losing the young generation.
[02:25:46.656 --> 02:25:48.997]  They admit it's rewiring the brain, brain damaging.
[02:25:49.337 --> 02:25:50.258]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:25:50.298 --> 02:25:54.079]  I go into this in the book and this is absolutely what is happening.
[02:25:54.719 --> 02:25:56.360]  It's rewiring the brain.
[02:25:56.580 --> 02:25:58.120]  It's dumbing down the brain.
[02:25:58.180 --> 02:26:00.921]  And there's perfect peer pressure to have social friends.
[02:26:01.161 --> 02:26:02.162]  They've got to be on it.
[02:26:02.362 --> 02:26:05.803]  So the human element lures you in to the dehumanization.
[02:26:06.845 --> 02:26:08.567]  But it's an addiction.
[02:26:08.788 --> 02:26:12.972]  If you are an alcoholic, who controls you?
[02:26:13.232 --> 02:26:13.813]  The alcohol.
[02:26:14.193 --> 02:26:16.336]  If you're a drug addict, who's the controller?
[02:26:16.576 --> 02:26:17.016]  The drug.
[02:26:17.417 --> 02:26:20.480]  If you are an addict of technology, who controls you?
[02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:21.421]  The technology.
[02:26:21.441 --> 02:26:21.762]  The drug.
[02:26:22.222 --> 02:26:26.345]  This is bringing the humans in and technology together.
[02:26:26.745 --> 02:26:31.508]  And they went from smartphones and they've now gone to what they call wearables.
[02:26:32.029 --> 02:26:39.994]  These are the Bluetooth in the ear, these are the Google Glass, and these are the Apple Watches.
[02:26:40.674 --> 02:26:47.219]  And the next stage, and they're pushing this along faster and faster because they have to get this done.
[02:26:48.123 --> 02:26:49.824]  Before enough people awakened.
[02:26:50.005 --> 02:26:54.708]  And by the way, sir, as you said before they admitted it, they admit it's to take over our consciousness.
[02:26:55.169 --> 02:26:56.690]  It's basically a holocaust.
[02:26:56.750 --> 02:26:58.231]  It's basically genocide.
[02:26:58.451 --> 02:26:59.872]  They say humans are crap.
[02:27:00.132 --> 02:27:02.694]  This new merger will be God.
[02:27:03.155 --> 02:27:07.959]  They're announcing they're going to end our world, and we're just sitting here with our thumbs in our you-know-whats.
[02:27:08.559 --> 02:27:10.281]  Well, we're probably on the smartphone.
[02:27:10.461 --> 02:27:13.824]  Well, I'm not, but a lot of people are on the smartphone while it's all happening.
[02:27:15.326 --> 02:27:33.183]  This guy, Ray Kurzweil, this Google executive who is the spokesman for Frankenstein, he has said that not too far into what we call the future, that most human thinking will be done from the cloud.
[02:27:33.803 --> 02:27:40.071]  And what he's referring to, although he won't tell you, of course, for obvious reasons, is something I've been writing about in the books for years.
[02:27:40.211 --> 02:27:41.352]  That is Childhood's End.
[02:27:41.392 --> 02:27:45.217]  That is the MI6, uh, you know, writer.
[02:27:45.357 --> 02:27:48.781]  He admitted that was an allegory for the real plan to put us into a collective computer mind.
[02:27:49.642 --> 02:27:51.503]  Where we all die and join the Evermind.
[02:27:51.543 --> 02:27:53.764]  I can't believe what a cult of freaks these are, David!
[02:27:54.364 --> 02:28:00.626]  But that's... What we're looking at is what I've been writing about for years, what I call the technological sub-reality.
[02:28:00.666 --> 02:28:02.047]  That's what he's calling the cloud.
[02:28:03.547 --> 02:28:18.053]  It's a Wi-Fi, if you like, a massive Wi-Fi cloud, a massive Wi-Fi technological sub-reality in the region of the planet that humans live in.
[02:28:19.051 --> 02:28:20.352]  It's a new dimension.
[02:28:20.432 --> 02:28:31.416]  It's an admitted new dimension where we can go and live in a false reality that also encroaches on the third dimension and gobbles up all of our data to cheat us and screw us and control us.
[02:28:31.876 --> 02:28:34.037]  It's literally a cloud of demonic locusts.
[02:28:35.419 --> 02:28:37.260]  It will be doing the thinking.
[02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:42.262]  And the chapter I write in Phantom Self is called Transphantomism.
[02:28:42.962 --> 02:28:52.666]  And I call it that because I've talked about Phantom Self and I am my name, I'm my life story, I'm my colour, I'm my race, I'm my religion.
[02:28:52.746 --> 02:28:55.908]  No, your infinite awareness having that experience.
[02:28:56.408 --> 02:29:06.275]  And it's taken even that level of the program, what I call phantom self, it's designed to take it into a whole new level of thought and perception control.
[02:29:06.695 --> 02:29:22.546]  And so we need to get our arses in gear in 2016, 17 and 18, and start to realize that this has to be the focus of our lives because our lives won't exist as they do now.
[02:29:22.566 --> 02:29:23.566]  David, David, this is incredible.
[02:29:23.706 --> 02:29:24.427]  Stay right there.
[02:29:24.987 --> 02:29:26.027]  You got me so excited.
[02:29:26.047 --> 02:29:29.808]  Do three more minutes on the other side to finish up on how you say we get out of this.
[02:29:30.128 --> 02:29:40.091]  Because what you're laying out is admitted scientific fact that they're taking away our senses that are meant to experience the world by our spirit, by our soul, by the energy.
[02:29:40.551 --> 02:29:47.332]  They're removing us into those where the soul's actually all by itself now being artificially programmed from without.
[02:29:47.633 --> 02:29:53.494]  This is obviously enslaving us, physically hurting us, and is basically demonic possession.
[02:29:53.814 --> 02:29:56.777]  ...through the computer, and then they admit that's their plan!
[02:29:57.077 --> 02:29:58.478]  My God, it's incredible!
[02:29:58.719 --> 02:30:00.380]  It's an invasion out of another dimension!
[02:30:11.053 --> 02:30:21.945]  Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid wants the Federal Election Commission to make an exemption and allow him to pocket over $600,000 for retirement from a slush fund.
[02:30:22.545 --> 02:30:27.170]  FEC guidelines prohibit personal use of unspent PAC and campaign money.
[02:30:27.791 --> 02:30:33.874]  Punishment for violating the prohibition on personal use ranges from hefty fines to possible imprisonment.
[02:30:34.374 --> 02:30:39.617]  The money can be used as a contribution to charity or donated to the National Party Committee.
[02:30:40.177 --> 02:30:42.638]  Democrat FEC Chairwoman Anne Ravel.
[02:30:42.938 --> 02:30:51.041]  Believes Reed has the right to the money due to his status as a, quote, historic and important figure and public official, end quote.
[02:30:51.441 --> 02:30:54.722]  The FEC has deferred action on Reed's request.
[02:30:55.303 --> 02:31:02.005]  FEC Commissioner Lee E. Goodman believes granting the request will send the wrong message and set a precedent.
[02:31:02.385 --> 02:31:06.267]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[02:31:10.503 --> 02:31:12.103]  It has happened.
[02:31:12.684 --> 02:31:14.504]  2015 has passed into history.
[02:31:14.524 --> 02:31:15.284]  Into lore.
[02:31:15.725 --> 02:31:18.505]  But now, 2016 has been born.
[02:31:19.045 --> 02:31:22.947]  And the decision lies in your hands to forge the destiny.
[02:31:24.107 --> 02:31:25.007]  Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[02:31:25.107 --> 02:31:29.689]  That's a little too epic, that Hollywood action-adventure-science-fiction voice I'm using.
[02:31:29.729 --> 02:31:38.031]  But quite frankly, that's how I feel like I should be talking about what happens when your body actually gets the real, natural nutrients it needs.
[02:31:38.291 --> 02:31:44.737]  And that's why we're offering the biggest discount ever on three of our best-selling products that turbocharge and cleanse the body.

[02:32:04.893 --> 02:32:06.294]  I can't help but get excited.
[02:32:06.394 --> 02:32:09.734]  Get healthy, fight the globalists, win-win, yeah!
[02:32:10.434 --> 02:32:14.135]  Secret 12, InfoWars Life's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:32:14.395 --> 02:32:20.516]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:32:20.717 --> 02:32:27.678]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[02:32:27.998 --> 02:32:36.843]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[02:32:37.103 --> 02:32:43.046]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:32:43.266 --> 02:32:45.948]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[02:32:48.090 --> 02:32:51.433]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:32:51.693 --> 02:32:53.314]  No needles, no injections.
[02:32:53.594 --> 02:32:55.076]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:32:55.236 --> 02:32:56.277]  Try it for yourself.
[02:32:56.437 --> 02:32:57.458]  Discover the secret.
[02:32:57.658 --> 02:32:57.998]  Secret 12.

[02:33:20.299 --> 02:33:24.461]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:33:25.181 --> 02:33:31.203]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.223 --> 02:33:32.604]  Steve Austin.
[02:33:32.744 --> 02:33:33.904]  Astronaut.
[02:33:34.044 --> 02:33:36.565]  A man barely alive.
[02:33:38.366 --> 02:33:40.367]  Gentlemen, we can rebuild him.
[02:33:41.127 --> 02:33:44.048]  We have the technology.
[02:33:44.068 --> 02:33:47.710]  We have the capability to make the world's first bionic man.
[02:33:51.994 --> 02:33:53.995]  Steve Austin will be that man.
[02:33:54.035 --> 02:33:58.218]  Better than he was before.
[02:33:58.919 --> 02:34:00.860]  Better.
[02:34:00.920 --> 02:34:02.581]  Stronger.
[02:34:02.621 --> 02:34:03.242]  Faster.
[02:34:03.462 --> 02:34:04.803]  Final signal, David.
[02:34:05.063 --> 02:34:08.045]  I've got a few minutes.
[02:34:08.145 --> 02:34:10.467]  He's gonna leave us.
[02:34:10.647 --> 02:34:13.909]  I'm gonna get into a bunch of news I haven't covered yet.
[02:34:19.140 --> 02:34:28.490]  I think of the cheesy kids movie Pacific Rim where aliens invade not from outer space but from a dimensional rift in the Pacific Ocean.
[02:34:29.491 --> 02:34:31.473]  I'm not saying that's real for the New York Times.
[02:34:31.513 --> 02:34:32.874]  I'm not getting into space aliens here.
[02:34:33.315 --> 02:34:37.999]  What I'm saying is the allegory is still true whether you believe it or not.
[02:34:38.988 --> 02:34:58.758]  That what we've created with the internet and Wi-Fi and these broadcasts is creating a new universe, a new world that is absorbing this world and marking everything and then putting it into its artificial system so it can artificially map it, track it, control it, predict the future.
[02:34:59.538 --> 02:35:02.300]  And I was told by NSA whistleblowers in person
[02:35:03.400 --> 02:35:07.582]  Uh, you know, literally in parking garages and stuff, people would come to me at events or where I worked.
[02:35:08.162 --> 02:35:10.143]  I had no idea how dangerous it was at the time.
[02:35:10.163 --> 02:35:14.806]  In other words, you've seen a lot of NSA folks on here since, former Director of Technicals and many others.
[02:35:14.846 --> 02:35:15.026]  I mean...
[02:35:15.902 --> 02:35:21.365]  And they would tell me, this is like 18 years ago, Alex, there's microphones in the Scientific Atlantic things and cameras.
[02:35:21.746 --> 02:35:24.067]  And I'd tear it open on air and it'd be there and I'd get death threats.
[02:35:24.167 --> 02:35:28.870]  I mean, on AXS TV, I'd tear it open and everyone was seeing the camera and the microphone, you know, 18 years ago.
[02:35:29.871 --> 02:35:36.495]  And then they would say, it's to predict the future, Alex, so then decisions can be given to key leaders to position themselves to take over markets.
[02:35:36.755 --> 02:35:40.157]  But also, once we can predict the future, we can steer the future.
[02:35:40.618 --> 02:35:42.099]  They're controlling the future.
[02:35:43.119 --> 02:35:51.564]  And these guys would like, you know, get in their $100,000 Mercedes in the parking garage scared, you know, and drive off.
[02:35:52.444 --> 02:35:57.387]  I mean, you know, these were guys that were in the system who were freaked out.
[02:35:58.087 --> 02:36:00.189]  And so, folks, we're talking God-like stuff.
[02:36:00.209 --> 02:36:05.932]  So even if aliens aren't real, the elite believes they are, and they believe all this power.
[02:36:05.992 --> 02:36:07.273]  They're gods, basically.
[02:36:07.493 --> 02:36:08.833]  You know, what are the gods of Olympus?
[02:36:08.853 --> 02:36:09.574]  They're like aliens.
[02:36:10.114 --> 02:36:18.782]  So the allegories there, where they're playing God, they're trying to force us into this artificial system, and they can make the blind see, make the deaf hear.
[02:36:18.922 --> 02:36:20.443]  There's all these things that sound great.
[02:36:20.484 --> 02:36:29.211]  My dad's brother was in a motorcycle accident, had epilepsy forever, has a brain chip, not just the stimulant system, and he's a lot better now.
[02:36:29.952 --> 02:36:48.360]  You know, the visitors have come, you know, it's the global elite, the sciences, they're giving us all these goodies, but there's Trojan horses in all of it, and our cancer rates way up, our IQs are dropping, the death rates are expanding, people are unhappy.
[02:36:49.991 --> 02:36:53.134]  But no one debates, why is breast cancer up 3,000% in the West?
[02:36:53.174 --> 02:36:56.156]  No one debates, why is pediatric cancer up more than 10,000%?
[02:36:56.497 --> 02:36:59.019]  No one debates, why is diabetes type 1 up, type 2?
[02:36:59.519 --> 02:37:02.742]  No one, it's just, oh, everything just sails forward.
[02:37:03.603 --> 02:37:05.524]  David Icke, three or four minutes, I know you gotta go.
[02:37:05.584 --> 02:37:08.647]  Thank you so much, sir, but what you're getting to is so important.
[02:37:08.887 --> 02:37:10.689]  Now there's no doubt, whoever they are,
[02:37:11.109 --> 02:37:15.053]  They're trying to submerge us as a species and kill us.
[02:37:15.113 --> 02:37:24.802]  This is a slow extermination program, sucking us in, drugging us, poisoning us, like a giant spider would do before it eats us.
[02:37:24.882 --> 02:37:25.303]  David Icke.
[02:37:26.394 --> 02:37:33.999]  Well, it's an assimilation and it's not just happening in the world that we see.
[02:37:35.100 --> 02:37:41.325]  I explain in Fence himself in some detail how we're being assimilated through nanotechnology.
[02:37:42.565 --> 02:37:48.990]  People should look on the internet and get up to date with something they're calling smart dust or neural dust.
[02:37:49.590 --> 02:37:55.815]  See, in our chats over the years, Alex, I've talked about the body being a biological computer.
[02:37:57.076 --> 02:38:03.558]  Because it's a biological computer, it can interact with other forms of technology.
[02:38:04.399 --> 02:38:14.262]  And what is happening when you see that bionic eye story, etc., and there are, you know, on the face of it, they're good things, and for the people that
[02:38:15.523 --> 02:38:17.024]  benefit from one or two of these things.
[02:38:17.044 --> 02:38:22.028]  It is a good thing, but that's not what the main thing is all about.
[02:38:22.048 --> 02:38:27.053]  It's about assimilating our perception and our consciousness and taking over our thinking completely.
[02:38:27.913 --> 02:38:34.159]  And so what they're doing is creating, and this is the word to watch for, synthetic.
[02:38:35.059 --> 02:38:37.321]  They're creating a synthetic everything.
[02:38:38.402 --> 02:38:38.823]  We are
[02:38:39.892 --> 02:38:48.055]  It's being systematically made more and more synthetic by breathing in nanotechnology that's coming out of chemtrails, for instance.
[02:38:49.115 --> 02:38:55.777]  And nanotechnology is not only affecting humans, it's affecting the environment.
[02:38:56.918 --> 02:38:59.459]  They're now developing synthetic cells.
[02:39:00.059 --> 02:39:02.560]  They're now developing synthetic blood.
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:06.681]  This is the thing, synthetic.
[02:39:07.281 --> 02:39:08.802]  It's creating a
[02:39:09.742 --> 02:39:14.043]  A new human, which is not like humans were before.
[02:39:14.263 --> 02:39:16.044]  They're turning us into replicants.
[02:39:16.084 --> 02:39:25.606]  They see us as their property, and then when we break free and become real humans again, because we were always real, they basically send out their cultural Blade Runners to kill us.
[02:39:25.846 --> 02:39:27.086]  They're throwing it in our face.
[02:39:27.666 --> 02:39:33.828]  Yeah, and so, you know, if people want to stop this, then they first have to reject
[02:39:34.768 --> 02:39:36.629]  Um, completely, transhumanism.
[02:39:37.089 --> 02:39:40.051]  I mean, it's a simple question for people with half a brain.
[02:39:40.671 --> 02:39:53.497]  Why would an elite that has spent so much time controlling humans and, um, suppressing humans and limiting humans want to make us superhuman?
[02:39:53.537 --> 02:39:54.258]  I mean, hello?
[02:39:55.598 --> 02:40:07.611]  What they want to do is to make us beyond human, to become synthetic computer terminals on their technologically generated web.
[02:40:08.032 --> 02:40:13.138]  And I've talked to you before about the plan is, and I think it's already there, personally.
[02:40:13.638 --> 02:40:16.199]  To make the internet conscious.
[02:40:16.819 --> 02:40:18.339]  And what are they talking about, Alex?
[02:40:18.419 --> 02:40:36.384]  I mean, we must have a... Google admits, 16 years ago, 17 years ago when they were founded, that this was declassified by the company themselves last year to Wired, that they have been trying to build a super brain that is AI from the start to then control humans by manipulating their data and merge with us.
[02:40:36.524 --> 02:40:37.925]  It is a takeover organ.
[02:40:37.965 --> 02:40:38.445]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:40:39.105 --> 02:40:45.006]  Yeah, this is the point, this is where I was going, and I go into this in Phantom Self in some detail, like I say.
[02:40:45.907 --> 02:41:04.631]  We keep being told, Alex, all the time, you've just mentioned it, AI, Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence this, Artificial Intelligence that, Artificial Intelligence will take over this, we'll have smart cities run by Artificial Intelligence, we'll have cars run by Artificial Intelligence, but this is the question which I answer in the book.
[02:41:05.836 --> 02:41:09.221]  What is that artificial intelligence?
[02:41:09.802 --> 02:41:10.363]  What is it?
[02:41:11.104 --> 02:41:12.086]  What controls it?
[02:41:13.087 --> 02:41:17.193]  I would suggest very strongly, and I produce evidence in the book,
[02:41:17.816 --> 02:41:25.480]  That this artificial intelligence is this non-human force that's been manipulating humanity for a very long time.
[02:41:25.680 --> 02:41:27.400]  Yeah, they're building the grid to take over.
[02:41:27.420 --> 02:41:29.722]  Well, if I was advanced aliens, this is what I would do.
[02:41:30.122 --> 02:41:38.546]  Alex, they're building the vehicle, they're building the technological vehicles for this artificial intelligence, i.e.
[02:41:38.606 --> 02:41:43.708]  not human intelligence, to take over the whole shebang, including the human mind.
[02:41:43.888 --> 02:41:56.355]  And they have us pay for it, and they have us build it, and then the military step back, turn off all their systems, spike human training for combat so humans can't even resist, everything goes robots, and then it seizes control.
[02:41:56.955 --> 02:42:08.541]  And whether it's aliens from deep space or another galaxy or another dimension or an artificially AI supercomputer, it doesn't matter because the elite are psychos and they run the machine regardless.
[02:42:08.922 --> 02:42:13.164]  Anyway, whatever it is, you can smell it's not of this world.
[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:17.462]  I would say the artificial intelligence I'm talking about runs the elite.
[02:42:19.544 --> 02:42:20.605]  Through their genetic codes.
[02:42:21.065 --> 02:42:22.966]  Yeah, they're just pawns in the game as well.
[02:42:22.986 --> 02:42:25.007]  They just don't think they are.
[02:42:25.027 --> 02:42:27.009]  They're the original biological androids.
[02:42:27.489 --> 02:42:29.290]  Yeah, they're just vehicles.
[02:42:29.430 --> 02:42:35.234]  They're also vehicles for this artificial intelligence I'm talking about.
[02:42:35.735 --> 02:42:43.120]  So this is what we're looking at, and this is why I say, Alex, that 16, 17, 18 are so absolutely vital.
[02:42:43.540 --> 02:42:55.649]  It's because they are now going to try to go into overdrive and steroid states to bring in this assimilation through the transhumanism as fast as possible.
[02:42:56.189 --> 02:43:02.770]  I mean, do you know, Sarah, I mean, this is just talking about chips, but there's a story on my website today that I came across.
[02:43:03.350 --> 02:43:07.391]  We have some sausages in this country, called Richmond sausages, right?
[02:43:08.291 --> 02:43:23.154]  Richmond sausages are now giving away chips, tracking chips, with their sausages, because they think it's a good play on words, partly, to put for children to put on their toys.
[02:43:24.272 --> 02:43:40.937]  And it's the most blatant conditioning and preparation for young people and kids today to find chipping humans to be perfectly, well this is the way things are, perfectly
[02:43:41.357 --> 02:43:41.917]  Natural.
[02:43:42.018 --> 02:43:43.879]  It's absolutely extraordinary.
[02:43:43.899 --> 02:43:51.204]  And even if it's unnatural up front, they just do it in an artificial environment, as you said last hour, until they just accept it because it's targeting them, not us.
[02:43:51.244 --> 02:43:51.844]  Here's an example.
[02:43:52.405 --> 02:43:53.926]  Eight years ago, I was sent a textbook.
[02:43:53.966 --> 02:43:55.007]  I showed it many times on air.
[02:43:55.047 --> 02:43:56.128]  It's somewhere around the office.
[02:43:56.548 --> 02:44:01.932]  And it's one of the major textbooks used by sixth graders in science across the United States.
[02:44:02.872 --> 02:44:04.914]  Millions and millions of children use it every year.
[02:44:05.594 --> 02:44:06.155]  And it's said
[02:44:07.250 --> 02:44:25.784]  The Department of Energy in 1992 launched a program with a Nobel Prize winner to save the Earth from ozone depletion, and to spray sunscreen over the Earth, and it's added to the jet turbines with different compounds to protect the Earth.
[02:44:26.684 --> 02:44:30.988]  So, they know they've got kids there, and they're telling them, we're chemtrailing you!
[02:44:31.923 --> 02:44:37.507]  Then they have shows on TV, you know, interviewing kooks who talk about fake chemtrails to make it look dumb.
[02:44:37.687 --> 02:44:40.950]  But to the kids, in government-approved textbook, they just admit it.
[02:44:41.230 --> 02:44:42.811]  You see the different downloads.
[02:44:43.132 --> 02:44:44.713]  We're in an earlier download.
[02:44:45.033 --> 02:44:46.154]  So we're kept in a paradigm.
[02:44:46.374 --> 02:44:46.894]  Here's an example.
[02:44:48.275 --> 02:44:53.399]  USA Today, I've noticed, will have, for people that still read papers, watered-down stuff.
[02:44:53.439 --> 02:44:55.381]  So I shot a video this weekend on it.
[02:44:55.501 --> 02:45:00.325]  One headline in the paper Friday was
[02:45:02.373 --> 02:45:02.773]  U.S.
[02:45:03.434 --> 02:45:09.138]  television news faces its mortality in election coverage and admits they basically have no viewers and are dead.
[02:45:09.699 --> 02:45:11.200]  The very same author, very same writer.
[02:45:11.760 --> 02:45:16.184]  On the paper version, it was written differently, different headline,
[02:45:17.512 --> 02:45:19.833]  About how, well, TV faces a lot of competition.
[02:45:20.373 --> 02:45:24.975]  So see, for the older folks still reading newspapers, it was, everything's kind of okay.
[02:45:25.315 --> 02:45:27.356]  But for people online, hey, it's dead.
[02:45:28.077 --> 02:45:32.558]  And you can just see how this is really hive mind, man.
[02:45:32.578 --> 02:45:35.440]  They've really, and now the CIA's going to.
[02:45:36.636 --> 02:45:38.957]  Where the articles are all basically written by computers.
[02:45:39.077 --> 02:45:42.179]  I mean, wow, I tell you, this is incredible, David.
[02:45:42.680 --> 02:45:43.500]  How do we stop it?
[02:45:43.540 --> 02:45:44.481]  How do we break free from it?
[02:45:44.521 --> 02:45:47.342]  Because whatever's behind it, it is super sophisticated.
[02:45:47.422 --> 02:45:57.869]  But if you just wake up to it and start withdrawing consent and support from it, and speaking out against it, we have titanous force, seven and a half billion of us, to change this.
[02:45:59.049 --> 02:46:02.651]  Well, you know, what you're just talking about,
[02:46:04.912 --> 02:46:19.211]  It's worth mentioning this, and I kind of indicated earlier that our generations that have been here long enough to see what was before this extreme of madness are so important.
[02:46:19.932 --> 02:46:25.176]  Because when you're born into the world, you tend to accept the world and what you find as, well, this is how it is.
[02:46:25.216 --> 02:46:26.097]  To you, it's normal.
[02:46:26.778 --> 02:46:32.022]  To someone like me, born in the 1950s, looking at what's happening now, it ain't normal to me.
[02:46:32.182 --> 02:46:33.563]  It's a form of insanity.
[02:46:34.264 --> 02:46:36.706]  But for people born into this world, it's their normal.
[02:46:37.566 --> 02:46:48.895]  And what they're doing is they're conditioning kids to have the agenda, the cloud, the transhumanist control, and that is the hive mind.
[02:46:49.876 --> 02:46:52.017]  The hive mind is the cloud, that's what it's supposed to be.
[02:46:53.318 --> 02:46:54.218]  It's their normal.
[02:46:54.959 --> 02:47:02.983]  And so what our generations need to do is to point out at every opportunity that it ain't normal and why it's not normal.
[02:47:03.543 --> 02:47:10.667]  What we need to do to overcome this, I mean, I've been saying for years, you can either find a solution to something,
[02:47:11.027 --> 02:47:12.509]  Or you can remove the cause of the problem.
[02:47:13.310 --> 02:47:21.743]  And clearly, the cause of the problem can be identified by how and where this system wants to take us.
[02:47:22.504 --> 02:47:25.528]  It wants to take us from even the present program
[02:47:27.012 --> 02:47:39.123]  Where we self-identify with colour, race, religion, name, history, and all that stuff, to the next stage, which is the transphantomist stage of control through a hive mind technological cloud.
[02:47:39.623 --> 02:47:48.411]  In other words, to control us, they need to constantly limit to our perception and ability to think and perceive.
[02:47:49.920 --> 02:47:54.445]  To remove the cause of the problem, we have to remove that.
[02:47:55.065 --> 02:47:58.569]  And to do that, we need another self-identity.
[02:47:59.169 --> 02:48:07.578]  To go beyond phantom self, never mind trans-phantom self, and see what we, and realize what we really are.
[02:48:08.338 --> 02:48:09.319]  We are awareness.
[02:48:10.313 --> 02:48:12.294]  A state of being aware.
[02:48:13.295 --> 02:48:16.277]  Forget bodies, forget form, forget it all.
[02:48:16.337 --> 02:48:31.008]  We are consciousness with a wicked force trying to literally strangle us and put a hood over our head and enslave us, absolutely shutting off the universe from us and free will.
[02:48:31.068 --> 02:48:34.090]  It's claustrophobic to feel the spirit of this enemy.
[02:48:34.791 --> 02:48:39.194]  They are hijacking our point of attention.
[02:48:40.888 --> 02:48:42.810]  You can be the ocean.
[02:48:43.510 --> 02:48:50.777]  You can open your mind to awareness, insight, inspiration that is literally infinite.
[02:48:51.257 --> 02:48:55.080]  And when you do that, you look at this world and it is an open book.
[02:48:56.542 --> 02:49:05.331]  Or you can disconnect from the ocean, which is what all this is about, and become the droplet, disconnected from the ocean.
[02:49:05.932 --> 02:49:09.796]  When you put the droplet back in the ocean, where does the droplet end and the ocean start?
[02:49:09.836 --> 02:49:11.698]  It's all one ocean, all one infinite ocean.
[02:49:11.718 --> 02:49:14.862]  And look at how they're trying to end families, make us all by ourselves.
[02:49:15.382 --> 02:49:32.200]  Yeah, but if you pull the droplet out of the ocean, you isolate it, and suddenly people in that state, and that's most people because of the programming, instead of getting their insight, their inspiration, their intuitive knowing, they're seeing through the lies from
[02:49:33.100 --> 02:49:37.103]  higher forms or levels of their own awareness.
[02:49:37.123 --> 02:49:40.065]  Not some alien in a spaceship, their own awareness.
[02:49:40.566 --> 02:49:51.053]  They get so concentrated in the five senses that the only way that they can look to get a fix on who they are and the nature of the world is out into the world.
[02:49:51.373 --> 02:49:52.574]  And what comes back?
[02:49:53.094 --> 02:49:56.957]  The media, the education system, all these vehicles.
[02:49:56.977 --> 02:50:01.140]  The false reality to tell you that you're lying eyes, you're lying gut are wrong
[02:50:02.042 --> 02:50:03.225]  You're absolutely right.
[02:50:03.927 --> 02:50:04.608]  Exactly.
[02:50:04.628 --> 02:50:09.300]  And the point being that if we're going to get out of this, and we are,
[02:50:10.486 --> 02:50:25.360]  But it's a massive challenge, is we've got to reverse that process of going into more and more narrow bands of perception, awareness and possibility, to coming out to our true self.
[02:50:25.720 --> 02:50:29.104]  And that is to say that I'm not, who are you?
[02:50:29.164 --> 02:50:29.764]  Who are you?
[02:50:29.784 --> 02:50:33.388]  I'm David Icke, born in Leicester in 1952.
[02:50:33.468 --> 02:50:35.630]  I was a footballer, then I did this, then I did that.
[02:50:36.010 --> 02:50:37.772]  No, that's my experience.
[02:50:38.012 --> 02:50:38.653]  Who am I?
[02:50:38.813 --> 02:50:39.334]  Who are you?
[02:50:39.354 --> 02:50:40.455]  Who is everyone?
[02:50:41.056 --> 02:50:43.879]  Infinite awareness having an experience.
[02:50:44.260 --> 02:50:56.133]  But what the game is, and transphantomism, transhumanism is the big next stage of the game, almost the end game, is to so isolate our point of attention within this reality.
[02:50:56.934 --> 02:51:01.356]  That we can access no other point of assessment.
[02:51:01.396 --> 02:51:04.558]  A total prison for the soul, David I. Always powerful.
[02:51:04.578 --> 02:51:05.539]  A prison for the mind.
[02:51:05.559 --> 02:51:06.959]  It's a prison for the mind.
[02:51:07.019 --> 02:51:08.000]  DavidI.com.
[02:51:08.240 --> 02:51:09.341]  David, thank you so much.
[02:51:09.361 --> 02:51:10.601]  Look forward to your world tour.
[02:51:10.701 --> 02:51:15.344]  Wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, a crashing economy.
[02:51:15.524 --> 02:51:16.424]  Are you ready?
[02:51:16.624 --> 02:51:19.286]  At best, your local stores have a three-day supply of food.
[02:51:19.386 --> 02:51:21.527]  Will your family have to fight over what's left?
[02:51:21.747 --> 02:51:25.231]  Are you willing to gamble your family's safety that it'll never happen to you?
[02:51:25.531 --> 02:51:30.297]  Be wise and be ready with 25-Year Shelf Life Wise Food Storage.
[02:51:30.617 --> 02:51:35.563]  Wise Food Storage provides affordable ready-made gourmet meals with a super long 25-year shelf life.
[02:51:36.764 --> 02:51:37.004]  We're good.
[02:51:51.681 --> 02:51:54.403]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:52:14.654 --> 02:52:15.155]  It's true.
[02:52:15.275 --> 02:52:19.238]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:52:19.419 --> 02:52:21.240]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:52:21.821 --> 02:52:26.305]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[02:52:26.605 --> 02:52:39.197]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.
[02:52:39.457 --> 02:52:43.019]  Big Berkey Water Filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[02:52:43.260 --> 02:52:45.561]  The gold standard in water purification.
[02:52:45.921 --> 02:52:49.944]  And our filters last for years at less than two cents per gallon.
[02:52:50.244 --> 02:52:50.845]  Big Berkey.
[02:52:51.045 --> 02:52:54.567]  The one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[02:52:54.767 --> 02:52:56.368]  Get your Big Berkey today.
[02:52:56.508 --> 02:52:58.810]  Call 1-877-99-BERKEY or click BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[02:52:58.830 --> 02:52:59.490]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[02:52:59.631 --> 02:53:00.991]  Big Berkey Water Filters.
[02:53:01.051 --> 02:53:02.332]  For the love of clean water.
[02:53:10.560 --> 02:53:13.226]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[02:53:13.286 --> 02:53:16.774]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[02:53:17.992 --> 02:53:21.153]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[02:53:21.474 --> 02:53:26.556]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[02:53:26.896 --> 02:53:28.137]  How is this even possible?
[02:53:28.397 --> 02:53:35.720]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[02:53:35.940 --> 02:53:43.363]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[02:53:43.583 --> 02:53:46.785]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[02:53:47.065 --> 02:53:54.489]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[02:53:54.870 --> 02:53:57.591]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[02:53:58.051 --> 02:54:02.194]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[02:54:02.214 --> 02:54:02.854]  That's Greens75.com.
[02:54:02.874 --> 02:54:03.275]  Greens75.com.
[02:54:13.763 --> 02:54:18.567]  I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing until they got a hold of me.
[02:54:19.228 --> 02:54:22.070]  Yeah, I got no friends because they read the papers.
[02:54:22.731 --> 02:54:24.032]  They won't be seen with me.
[02:54:25.433 --> 02:54:26.735]  I'm feeling real shot down.
[02:54:26.815 --> 02:54:27.755]  I'm feeling me.
[02:54:27.775 --> 02:54:32.399]  A little bit of the legendary Alice Cooper.
[02:54:32.440 --> 02:54:33.801]  He's a patriot, pro-gun Christian.
[02:54:40.090 --> 02:54:44.014]  All right, that's enough.
[02:54:45.256 --> 02:54:48.499]  Hard to turn that off, though.
[02:54:48.539 --> 02:54:49.620]  Let me get serious here.
[02:54:53.144 --> 02:55:00.152]  I have done deep research, as many of you have and our guests have, and all I'm telling you is, the global standardization system
[02:55:01.636 --> 02:55:08.317]  That is being shut up is anti-human and is meant to reduce world population and destroy culture and is super bad.
[02:55:09.738 --> 02:55:12.838]  And the direction technology is going is to enslave and control us.
[02:55:13.259 --> 02:55:16.219]  I'm always on the leading cutting edge of it to reach people.
[02:55:17.259 --> 02:55:20.540]  But just because I'm jacking into the Matrix, baby, doesn't mean I like it.
[02:55:21.400 --> 02:55:23.841]  And I'm not some anti-technology person.
[02:55:25.734 --> 02:55:27.455]  Man, if vaccines work, I want them.
[02:55:27.515 --> 02:55:30.215]  If bionic eyes work when I'm 75 or 80, I want them.
[02:55:30.616 --> 02:55:32.296]  If bionic hearts work, I want it.
[02:55:32.836 --> 02:55:39.278]  The problem is the New World Order, folks, takes away your health and then gives you a replacement that takes your humanity.
[02:55:40.539 --> 02:55:42.539]  And, I mean, that's not just me sitting back saying that.
[02:55:42.619 --> 02:55:51.142]  I've looked at this hard and, man, at the bottom of the hole, this rabbit hole, is something so scary.
[02:55:54.662 --> 02:55:56.343]  It makes my soul shudder.
[02:55:58.425 --> 02:56:00.807]  Not wanting to be close to it, not wanting to be around it.
[02:56:02.649 --> 02:56:07.133]  I mean, there's all these little toys and candies and jewelry laying around open into this hole.
[02:56:07.693 --> 02:56:09.535]  You stick your arm up in there, baby.
[02:56:10.936 --> 02:56:14.959]  There's bait outside that hole to get you to go in there.
[02:56:16.701 --> 02:56:20.144]  And everything's pumpkin pie till you get deeper down that hole.
[02:56:21.004 --> 02:56:22.425]  And this system doesn't...
[02:56:23.328 --> 02:56:25.590]  Hit you with happy gas at the end before it eats you.
[02:56:27.593 --> 02:56:33.459]  It's done all this so it can slowly tear your soul and heart and mind apart.
[02:56:35.501 --> 02:56:38.645]  By the way, Ike talks about, you know, it wants to get our mind, not our soul.
[02:56:38.705 --> 02:56:39.666]  No, it wants our soul.
[02:56:42.318 --> 02:56:51.243]  Because if they can get us sucked into the mind so much, and then poison our soul with these systems, there is good and evil.
[02:56:51.523 --> 02:56:54.505]  We will then resonate with the darkness, and it's over, they got us.
[02:56:55.785 --> 02:57:00.668]  You know, a lot of the more modern folks, the New Agers and stuff, think that, oh, it's all good, you can transcend this.
[02:57:00.688 --> 02:57:01.529]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:57:03.390 --> 02:57:09.233]  There is evil at the highest levels of the spectrum of dimensions.
[02:57:09.453 --> 02:57:10.994]  I can just know it in my gut.
[02:57:13.781 --> 02:57:16.002]  Because there's free will in this universe.
[02:57:19.143 --> 02:57:21.483]  Now, we see the propaganda of North Korea.
[02:57:21.583 --> 02:57:24.624]  It's corny, it's comical, it's sickening, it's ridiculous.
[02:57:28.005 --> 02:57:30.305]  But look at our own propaganda people are buying into.
[02:57:30.345 --> 02:57:32.586]  You laugh at people crying when Kim Jong-un died.
[02:57:32.886 --> 02:57:33.526]  It's ridiculous.
[02:57:33.546 --> 02:57:34.466]  Three days of crying.
[02:57:34.946 --> 02:57:36.667]  If they don't do that, they're sent to a forced labor camp.
[02:57:37.398 --> 02:57:38.639]  Because that's what the economy is based on.
[02:57:38.839 --> 02:57:51.966]  But here they are announcing the miniature H-bombs they supposedly created, and then just look at the false reality with some little fat dictator with weirdo crazy women in pink dresses announcing they can blow America up.
[02:57:52.147 --> 02:58:00.091]  It's ridiculous, but only because you are more conscious than people living under this level of brainwashing.
[02:58:00.571 --> 02:58:02.653]  But what you face is even more sophisticated.
[02:58:02.693 --> 02:58:03.033]  Here it is.
[02:58:08.820 --> 02:58:15.023]  The first H-bomb test was successfully conducted at 10 o'clock on January 6, 2016.
[02:58:15.103 --> 02:58:18.305]  Look at the power trip.
[02:58:18.545 --> 02:58:28.110]  Look at the totalitarianism.
[02:58:28.130 --> 02:58:30.771]  And this is just a total joke.
[02:58:30.791 --> 02:58:34.473]  We will not give up nuclear program as long as the United States maintains a stance of aggression.
[02:58:34.493 --> 02:58:35.134]  Okay, that's enough of her.
[02:58:36.428 --> 02:58:39.149]  But see, she's bad, they're bad, then our leaders are bad.
[02:58:39.169 --> 02:58:41.290]  It doesn't make like you choose America or choose these people.
[02:58:41.470 --> 02:58:51.314]  Because America has been hijacked by a bunch of criminals that are coming after your speech, your guns, your health care, your kids, your property, your religion, everything.
[02:58:52.035 --> 02:58:53.815]  It doesn't matter if it's good, bad, or indifferent.
[02:58:53.875 --> 02:58:55.736]  They want you to do what they say.
[02:58:55.756 --> 02:58:59.358]  Obama said Congress better get in line with him.
[02:59:00.566 --> 02:59:02.167]  It has happened.
[02:59:02.187 --> 02:59:04.048]  2015 has passed into history.
[02:59:04.609 --> 02:59:05.389]  Into lore.
[02:59:05.810 --> 02:59:08.572]  But now, 2016 has been born.
[02:59:09.132 --> 02:59:13.035]  And the decision lies in your hands to forge the destiny.
[02:59:14.175 --> 02:59:15.076]  Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[02:59:15.196 --> 02:59:19.779]  That's a little too epic, that Hollywood action-adventure-science-fiction voice I'm using.
[02:59:19.799 --> 02:59:28.125]  But quite frankly, that's how I feel like I should be talking about what happens when your body actually gets the real, natural nutrients it needs.
[02:59:28.385 --> 02:59:34.810]  And that's why we're offering the biggest discount ever on three of our best-selling products that turbocharge and cleanse the body.

[02:59:54.064 --> 02:59:54.885]  I just did it again.
[02:59:54.965 --> 02:59:56.386]  I can't help but get excited.
[02:59:56.466 --> 02:59:57.087]  Get healthy!
[02:59:57.267 --> 02:59:58.108]  Fight the globalists!
[02:59:58.328 --> 02:59:58.948]  Win-win!
[02:59:59.168 --> 02:59:59.829]  Yeah!
[03:00:02.451 --> 03:00:08.676]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:11.778 --> 03:00:16.842]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:17.202 --> 03:00:19.484]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:00:24.275 --> 03:00:33.539]  By the way, one of the favorite things of trolls on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and we let them operate because people need to be educated about it.
[03:00:33.559 --> 03:00:34.520]  They can see it for themselves.
[03:00:35.520 --> 03:00:36.581]  They call for violence and stuff.
[03:00:36.901 --> 03:00:41.303]  Obviously, third-party discus has computer systems that censor it, but we don't moderate or control it.
[03:00:43.744 --> 03:00:49.987]  But if you go on there, our average video now gets about a half million views.
[03:00:50.047 --> 03:00:52.368]  I mean, I can shoot a three-minute video while I'm getting on an airplane.
[03:00:53.345 --> 03:00:55.526]  Yesterday and it gets hundreds of thousands of views.
[03:00:55.566 --> 03:01:07.654]  Go to our big Facebook, click on the all videos right there, and then you can see Congress considers criminal charges against Obama 797,000 views.
[03:01:07.694 --> 03:01:11.056]  They're looking at impeachment proceedings.
[03:01:11.616 --> 03:01:13.838]  Insider Obama about to unleash hell.
[03:01:18.244 --> 03:01:24.187]  I wanted to say what the insider told me, but then I didn't want to plagiarize it, but I don't want to get, but it's off-record what they told me, so I just said that.
[03:01:24.807 --> 03:01:25.447]  And then go back.
[03:01:25.487 --> 03:01:26.828]  These are all videos I shot yesterday.
[03:01:28.208 --> 03:01:29.769]  Obama wants civil unrest.
[03:01:29.789 --> 03:01:29.769]  496,000, 1,168,797,000.
[03:01:32.250 --> 03:01:32.450]  All right?
[03:01:32.470 --> 03:01:35.131]  And then we got some of them with 2 million views, but it's just exponentially growing.
[03:01:35.151 --> 03:01:36.331]  People say, what are you doing on Facebook?
[03:01:48.180 --> 03:02:03.089]  Oh my gosh, you say Zuckerberg's bad, but it's... I mean, it'd be like Green Berets parachuting in to blow up an, you know, al-Qaeda weapons dump or something, and you're like, what are you doing on al-Qaeda property?
[03:02:03.149 --> 03:02:04.590]  What are you wearing?
[03:02:04.610 --> 03:02:07.652]  It just plays on a public that's ignorant.
[03:02:09.096 --> 03:02:17.340]  It's like different characters coming up to the Bundys out there so they wouldn't talk to Joe Biggs like Joe Biggs needs to talk to you.
[03:02:17.480 --> 03:02:19.120]  Just be lucky to talk to us.
[03:02:21.121 --> 03:02:25.003]  I'm not against the Bundys, it's just that people go, Alex says you're a fed Bundy!
[03:02:25.183 --> 03:02:26.704]  Better not talk to Alex.
[03:02:27.024 --> 03:02:31.786]  No proof, didn't say it, but it doesn't matter because the infighting is so fun.
[03:02:32.306 --> 03:02:36.588]  We're just there to say we don't think this is a good idea at this point and to call for peace.
[03:02:37.739 --> 03:02:40.681]  We're there so that our information gets out to people.
[03:02:41.182 --> 03:02:43.023]  Not there to talk to you in your cowboy hat.
[03:02:43.464 --> 03:02:46.066]  Like you're, you know, Little Lord Fauntleroy or something.
[03:02:46.386 --> 03:02:47.767]  I can put a cowboy hat on, too.
[03:02:48.407 --> 03:02:53.652]  The point is, and walk around militia guys going, Strike force command!
[03:02:53.692 --> 03:02:55.453]  You know, all the rest of this stuff.
[03:02:56.674 --> 03:02:57.895]  We're in the info war.
[03:02:57.955 --> 03:02:58.976]  We know what we're doing.
[03:03:01.318 --> 03:03:06.762]  And I just see patriots played by disinfo so many times over and over again.
[03:03:08.942 --> 03:03:11.182]  Hey, watch out, feds, we're trying to infiltrate and provocateur.
[03:03:11.682 --> 03:03:13.143]  Alex said we're feds!
[03:03:14.943 --> 03:03:18.864]  It's like just total straw man stuff, and I know they're good people.
[03:03:19.264 --> 03:03:22.004]  It's just frustrating to see it.
[03:03:23.404 --> 03:03:25.945]  I mean, look at this headline by Kit Daniels, Infowars.com.
[03:03:25.985 --> 03:03:29.806]  American skeptical of global warming can lose gun rights due to executive order.
[03:03:30.386 --> 03:03:31.206]  That needs to get out.
[03:03:32.086 --> 03:03:36.407]  We need to get these movements that we know are in Congress to impeach Obama.
[03:03:36.887 --> 03:03:38.207]  That needs to be the big push.
[03:03:44.005 --> 03:03:47.547]  Quite frankly, the whole thing out in Oregon, I believe, is a distraction and a diversion.
[03:03:47.727 --> 03:03:48.767]  We know there's land grabbing.
[03:03:48.787 --> 03:03:49.888]  We know there's criminal activity.
[03:03:50.088 --> 03:03:51.189]  People have a right to stand up to it?
[03:03:51.329 --> 03:03:51.889]  Absolutely.
[03:03:53.210 --> 03:04:03.995]  I'm saying the optics at this time aren't good because it's wide open for infiltration, wide open for the feds to do something to blame the patriots, and we're winning in the info war.
[03:04:04.295 --> 03:04:06.216]  They want to get a physical war going.
[03:04:06.496 --> 03:04:07.317]  That's my view.
[03:04:07.617 --> 03:04:09.358]  You may disagree with my strategies.
[03:04:09.938 --> 03:04:10.839]  It's a free country.
[03:04:11.733 --> 03:04:14.797]  We're not going to call for escalating anything.
[03:04:15.658 --> 03:04:21.566]  Obama is pushing and pushing and pushing to get something because you look politically, they're losing everything they got.
[03:04:22.888 --> 03:04:25.771]  Governors are suing, open carries passing everywhere.
[03:04:25.791 --> 03:04:27.894]  They are panicking.
[03:04:28.295 --> 03:04:29.757]  The enemy is in trouble.
[03:04:31.360 --> 03:04:33.723]  I'm going to come back and hand the baton to David Knight.
[03:04:34.003 --> 03:04:35.405]  And I didn't plug last hour.
[03:04:35.465 --> 03:04:37.307]  I told David Knight, I really need you to plug.
[03:04:37.427 --> 03:04:39.290]  We're losing money right now.
[03:04:39.970 --> 03:04:42.514]  We made good money to fund ourselves last few months.
[03:04:42.534 --> 03:04:44.736]  Now into the new year, we keep it this rate.
[03:04:44.816 --> 03:04:45.878]  I'll have to let people go.
[03:04:45.898 --> 03:04:48.601]  I'm not saying that's going to happen because it's just cycles.
[03:04:49.682 --> 03:04:50.783]  I need to get sponsors.
[03:04:50.864 --> 03:04:51.865]  I do not skip breaks.
[03:04:52.005 --> 03:04:54.287]  And I need to plug products.
[03:04:54.407 --> 03:05:00.474]  And you need to go to InfoWarsLife.com where you can get 15% off everything until Friday.
[03:05:00.494 --> 03:05:03.057]  InfoWarsStore.com is the big shopping cart.

[03:05:03.878 --> 03:05:05.980]  Whether it's Hillary for prison shirts that are limited edition.
[03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:06.721]  We're not making more.
[03:05:07.162 --> 03:05:07.582]  You name it.
[03:05:07.622 --> 03:05:09.044]  PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[03:05:09.084 --> 03:05:09.684]  Six months free.
[03:05:10.526 --> 03:05:17.033]  The Obama administration is pushing for the largest gun grab in American history.
[03:05:17.213 --> 03:05:21.157]  We're also taking steps to make the background check system more efficient.
[03:05:21.457 --> 03:05:25.161]  And we're going to bring an outdated background check system into the 21st century.
[03:05:25.421 --> 03:05:29.726]  Anyone critical of the government could have their Second Amendment rights taken away.
[03:05:30.026 --> 03:05:45.795]  Simply if psychologists diagnose them with what they are calling oppositional defiant disorder, which the American Psychiatric Association describes as a defiant, disobedient, and hostile behavior toward authority.
[03:05:46.035 --> 03:05:53.860]  Other measures will allow doctors to report patients to the FBI and RFID tracking with smart guns.
[03:05:54.060 --> 03:05:55.801]  We're gonna boost gun safety technology.
[03:05:56.061 --> 03:05:58.823]  We need to develop new technologies that make guns safer.
[03:05:59.324 --> 03:06:04.688]  We can set it up so you can't unlock your phone unless you got the right fingerprint.
[03:06:04.828 --> 03:06:06.229]  Why can't we do the same thing for our guns?
[03:06:06.690 --> 03:06:09.872]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.

[03:07:10.051 --> 03:07:16.876]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered 6 months free at Christmas.
[03:07:16.956 --> 03:07:19.658]  We've always offered 5 months free.
[03:07:19.858 --> 03:07:25.462]  But since I announced 6 free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[03:07:25.783 --> 03:07:27.464]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[03:07:29.185 --> 03:07:32.188]  It's grown into Info Wars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[03:07:32.469 --> 03:07:41.017]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books, and other exclusive documentaries are available for streaming or download in HD at PrismPlanet.tv.

[03:08:26.537 --> 03:08:40.701]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:40.961 --> 03:08:44.481]  Well, this song's really true when you get behind the car with 700 plus horsepower.
[03:08:48.382 --> 03:08:54.304]  You can pretty much instantly go to heaven in that car, both figuratively and literally.
[03:08:56.064 --> 03:08:57.025]  Hit that accelerator.
[03:08:59.766 --> 03:09:01.167]  Just one more.
[03:09:01.927 --> 03:09:03.188]  And then, oh, there comes a blurb.
[03:09:06.809 --> 03:09:08.230]  In the county jail!
[03:09:11.932 --> 03:09:15.634]  Alright, I came in this morning and I told the writers, I didn't really go tell the reporters this.
[03:09:17.139 --> 03:09:20.781]  But, I mean, I can tell you what the big zeitgeist is right now.
[03:09:21.121 --> 03:09:23.742]  And it's the zeitgeist because it should be.
[03:09:24.202 --> 03:09:32.566]  You know, sometimes the artificial zeitgeist is Caitlyn Jenner, or the other Kardashian baby photos, or something stupid that's a diversion.
[03:09:33.427 --> 03:09:35.509]  But sometimes the zeitgeist is what it should be.
[03:09:35.669 --> 03:09:41.734]  And when the zeitgeist is on target to promote freedom and defend liberty, then I want to be there.
[03:09:41.774 --> 03:09:42.915]  Let me tell you the big issue.
[03:09:43.515 --> 03:09:45.757]  Obama is acting as a dictator right now.
[03:09:45.817 --> 03:09:48.860]  That's the big overarching big enchilada.
[03:09:50.121 --> 03:09:58.107]  We ought to play these clips again in this hour where he said, I'm constrained by the system of our founders and can't go against the guns without congressional action.
[03:09:59.308 --> 03:10:00.329]  Then we played the new clip.
[03:10:01.946 --> 03:10:03.627]  of him saying Congress needs to get in line.
[03:10:04.707 --> 03:10:06.528]  And that I'm moving because they haven't moved.
[03:10:08.108 --> 03:10:08.928]  It's unprecedented.
[03:10:09.188 --> 03:10:09.729]  So you got that.
[03:10:09.829 --> 03:10:11.949]  Then you've got all the ways he's coming at the guns.
[03:10:12.089 --> 03:10:13.290]  I mean, it's the worst ever.
[03:10:13.350 --> 03:10:14.230]  Worse than I thought.
[03:10:14.630 --> 03:10:15.511]  I'm rarely wrong.
[03:10:15.611 --> 03:10:16.311]  I was wrong here.
[03:10:16.351 --> 03:10:17.911]  This is worse than I thought.
[03:10:18.151 --> 03:10:19.732]  And let me tell you what's even worse than that.
[03:10:23.973 --> 03:10:26.294]  There's an anemic response from the Republicans.
[03:10:26.714 --> 03:10:29.015]  Paul Ryan doesn't know what he's gonna do.
[03:10:29.335 --> 03:10:31.076]  They're gonna have some hearings and look at it.
[03:10:31.980 --> 03:10:34.942]  Instantly they should be saying impeachment for federal power grab.
[03:10:36.223 --> 03:10:37.243]  Presidential power grab.
[03:10:37.463 --> 03:10:38.124]  Instantly!
[03:10:38.604 --> 03:10:43.907]  The president's already been legislating up there on so many issues and they haven't stopped them.
[03:10:45.348 --> 03:10:49.731]  Gee, I mean they won't even repeal Obamacare, that's ridiculously corrupt and super unpopular.
[03:10:50.271 --> 03:10:53.693]  GOP scrambles for response to Obama's gun control actions.
[03:10:55.214 --> 03:10:59.757]  Exclusive, Rand Paul, I will fight Obama tooth and nail on executive gun control.
[03:11:03.328 --> 03:11:07.610]  Trump has come out and said, as president, he'll try to reverse all this.
[03:11:09.852 --> 03:11:21.238]  Okay, fine, but I get you don't want to make him a political martyr, Trump, as you said on the show a month ago, but we need, must go after Obama now.
[03:11:21.778 --> 03:11:25.521]  Everybody keeps saying, oh, leave him in for another 11 and a half months, it'll be okay.
[03:11:25.641 --> 03:11:26.761]  No, it's not.
[03:11:29.943 --> 03:11:31.264]  This is a crazed maniac.
[03:11:36.493 --> 03:11:38.334]  Well, they say expand background checks.
[03:11:38.354 --> 03:11:41.295]  They mean just put whatever they want with a no-fly list.
[03:11:41.335 --> 03:11:43.235]  The same system of just making stuff up.
[03:11:43.515 --> 03:11:44.536]  No one knows where it comes from.
[03:11:44.576 --> 03:11:45.476]  You just can't buy a gun.
[03:11:45.916 --> 03:11:48.397]  And turning everybody into tattletales if you say something they don't like.
[03:11:48.817 --> 03:11:50.158]  They've already got it in place, folks.
[03:11:50.298 --> 03:11:58.961]  I've talked to two people that went to Cabela's in the last month.
[03:11:59.101 --> 03:11:59.561]  Two of them.
[03:12:00.421 --> 03:12:03.022]  And these folks have talked to other folks it's happened to at other gun shops.
[03:12:05.376 --> 03:12:15.438]  And someone invariably will talk about Obama and the gun control or whatever, and if they say that guy's a traitor and a piece of filth or whatever, they won't sell it to you and then basically call the police on you and put you in a database.
[03:12:15.758 --> 03:12:18.979]  They've set up their spy networks, folks, all over the country.
[03:12:19.899 --> 03:12:22.940]  And they're so politically correct, complying with the ATF.
[03:12:22.960 --> 03:12:26.021]  The ATF came to Texas gun owners, Texas gun shops a few years ago.
[03:12:26.041 --> 03:12:30.562]  We got the document, broke nationally here because I was given it by a gun shop.
[03:12:32.363 --> 03:12:36.465]  And they go, you're going to report to us the names of people buying guns in a separate file.
[03:12:38.126 --> 03:12:42.427]  You're going to call it like it's a suspicious activity on people buying two guns.
[03:12:44.628 --> 03:12:46.729]  And they looked at him and they said, but that's not suspicious.
[03:12:47.129 --> 03:12:48.390]  And it's not our job to call you.
[03:12:48.490 --> 03:12:49.811]  They said, you'll do it or we'll shut you down.
[03:12:49.851 --> 03:12:50.351]  Here's the memo.
[03:12:53.371 --> 03:12:58.493]  Extrajudicial, outside of law, just turning people into informants like they're criminals.
[03:12:58.753 --> 03:13:00.154]  Hey, I caught you with that cocaine.
[03:13:00.434 --> 03:13:04.615]  Better start reporting for me on who sells it to you and what you do, or I'm going to put you in jail.
[03:13:05.015 --> 03:13:06.476]  Well, they're not selling cocaine.
[03:13:06.516 --> 03:13:08.997]  They're selling legal guns and following the law.
[03:13:12.718 --> 03:13:16.860]  And this is what they're doing, folks, because most citizens want to be little secret agents in America.
[03:13:16.900 --> 03:13:20.121]  They watch 24 and all these other shows about it.
[03:13:21.192 --> 03:13:25.174]  Meanwhile, Al-Qaeda now admits they have Stinger missiles and so does ISIS.
[03:13:25.194 --> 03:13:26.275]  Well, of course it was given to them.
[03:13:26.455 --> 03:13:27.716]  So how did the London Independent spin it?
[03:13:31.158 --> 03:13:37.221]  They came out and they said, I covered it last hour, ISIS now has technology to shoot down airliners.
[03:13:37.281 --> 03:13:39.082]  And I saw, I go, oh, that's going to be the missiles.
[03:13:39.762 --> 03:13:40.683]  And that's how they spin it.
[03:13:41.283 --> 03:13:44.385]  ISIS developed sophisticated new weaponry capable of shooting down passenger jets.
[03:13:45.065 --> 03:13:47.467]  They didn't develop the sophisticated weaponry.
[03:13:50.200 --> 03:13:51.881]  But I knew that's how they'd get it out there.
[03:13:52.261 --> 03:13:55.783]  I heard, and now it's going to be, I heard ISIS got Stinger Missiles now!
[03:13:56.023 --> 03:13:57.083]  They made them!
[03:13:59.144 --> 03:14:02.486]  And then you read, they recharged the batteries on them.
[03:14:02.846 --> 03:14:03.846]  Oh, because they were old.
[03:14:04.006 --> 03:14:06.147]  Oh, they developed the sophisticated weaponry.
[03:14:06.748 --> 03:14:16.272]  And so what's sick is, I read that headline and knew it was them putting the cover story out so they could start shooting down the jet airliners and bring in real martial law.
[03:14:17.313 --> 03:14:21.559]  And no one that gave them the missiles in Benghazi four years ago gets in trouble.
[03:14:22.019 --> 03:14:24.182]  My crime is I know their tricks.
[03:14:24.583 --> 03:14:31.311]  My crime is... They'll come in here and hand me a news article that I shouldn't do this.
[03:14:33.139 --> 03:14:34.420]  But I just do it instinctively.
[03:14:34.480 --> 03:14:43.365]  I'll read the first line, and then I'll tell everybody, you've seen me do this, and I'll start reading, and then three paragraphs down, the exact words I said are in it.
[03:14:44.346 --> 03:14:45.306]  And I really shouldn't do that.
[03:14:45.586 --> 03:14:49.729]  I'm so confident that I'm going to give the mainstream media all the time for this, I don't care.
[03:14:49.789 --> 03:14:52.350]  A lot of times I'm going to have to read it.
[03:14:53.251 --> 03:14:59.154]  I know the enemy so well, and what stinking frauds you are, and the type of stuff you pull.
[03:15:01.733 --> 03:15:04.394]  Then when I read the article, I almost cried.
[03:15:04.414 --> 03:15:08.395]  Because I keep asking, how are they going to get these missiles to them?
[03:15:08.735 --> 03:15:11.956]  Everybody knows that they gave them to them because we and others exposed them.
[03:15:12.296 --> 03:15:15.137]  And then they're still going to just roll ahead and let them blow everything up.
[03:15:15.537 --> 03:15:19.138]  And then they're going to have checkpoints miles away from airports and random ones.
[03:15:19.358 --> 03:15:22.039]  Because you know, the jet airliners got shot down.
[03:15:22.339 --> 03:15:22.779]  You know.
[03:15:22.799 --> 03:15:24.939]  I mean, we're not going to let them do that.
[03:15:25.139 --> 03:15:27.180]  Why don't you sit down and shut up for America?
[03:15:30.700 --> 03:15:35.864]  So, the big stories are Obama is acting as a dictator.
[03:15:35.904 --> 03:15:38.146]  This is the biggest assault on freedom of speech ever.
[03:15:39.808 --> 03:15:44.171]  Because now they're saying they're going to go after you for your political speech and you may not be able to have guns.
[03:15:44.211 --> 03:15:45.432]  That's meant to be a chilling effect.
[03:15:45.973 --> 03:15:47.494]  They've set up all these spy networks.
[03:15:47.574 --> 03:15:49.316]  It's a national registration database.
[03:15:49.596 --> 03:15:51.438]  It turns your doctors and everybody into spies.
[03:15:52.939 --> 03:15:53.679]  It's just incredible.
[03:15:54.780 --> 03:15:55.721]  That's the big story.
[03:15:56.562 --> 03:15:58.363]  And we need to start the impeachment.
[03:15:59.650 --> 03:16:05.593]  I'm going to have this report, it went viral yesterday, reposted at Infowars.com to the front by Steve Watson.
[03:16:05.693 --> 03:16:18.980]  I want the writers and everybody to go list the crimes of Obama and we need to write articles about it's time to push for impeachment.
[03:16:20.021 --> 03:16:21.662]  It is not going to make Obama popular.
[03:16:22.082 --> 03:16:23.443]  It's not going to save his bacon.
[03:16:23.663 --> 03:16:24.603]  He's a lame duck anyways.
[03:16:24.643 --> 03:16:25.964]  It's not going to make Hillary look good.
[03:16:26.204 --> 03:16:27.185]  Go after them all!
[03:16:28.800 --> 03:16:31.341]  Look how Trump's tough and at the front of the thing.
[03:16:31.361 --> 03:16:35.082]  You don't beat these tyrants by playing patty cake with them.
[03:16:35.162 --> 03:16:37.423]  I mean, I'm ready for them to set me up, kill me, whatever.
[03:16:37.443 --> 03:16:42.525]  I mean, folks, don't you get what it takes to be free and you don't even have to risk your life to fight them.
[03:16:43.405 --> 03:16:45.226]  Those of us at the tip of the spear do.
[03:16:46.886 --> 03:16:47.806]  And it's an honor.
[03:16:49.027 --> 03:16:52.948]  I'm going to watch these demons run around and engage, taking down the country and my family's future.
[03:16:53.508 --> 03:16:58.170]  And I'm good because I'm standing up for self-preservation.
[03:16:59.977 --> 03:17:00.958]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:17:01.558 --> 03:17:05.702]  That's evil, folks, to say it's good and wonderful to stand up and risk your life.
[03:17:09.105 --> 03:17:12.147]  Maybe if we were being conquered by some group that wasn't as evil.
[03:17:12.167 --> 03:17:17.011]  But folks, you got to be crazy not to stand up against these people.
[03:17:20.154 --> 03:17:21.135]  You got to be nuts.
[03:17:23.197 --> 03:17:24.518]  You got to be out of your mind.
[03:17:26.291 --> 03:17:31.396]  I mean, they're coming to take everything we've got.
[03:17:31.536 --> 03:17:32.937]  They are eugenicists.
[03:17:33.158 --> 03:17:40.625]  They put glyphosate out there knowing in the 70s it gave the rats cancer across the board big time.
[03:17:40.905 --> 03:17:42.447]  I mean, it's worse than cigarettes.
[03:17:45.208 --> 03:17:52.973]  I see all these articles about all the little kids that died and how much courage they got and they make a whole industry out of it and raising money to find the cure for all these new cancers.
[03:17:53.334 --> 03:17:55.855]  It's being done on purpose.
[03:17:56.095 --> 03:18:00.258]  We're being trained to just sit here and die and think nothing's going on.
[03:18:03.821 --> 03:18:05.522]  I'm not on a suicide mission!
[03:18:08.010 --> 03:18:11.319]  A suicide mission would be going along with this!
[03:18:12.241 --> 03:18:15.990]  I'm not gonna sit here knowing all this and just shut up!
[03:18:22.022 --> 03:18:23.022]  We need urgency.
[03:18:23.182 --> 03:18:28.904]  Everybody, myself included, many of my crew, you name it, we just get comfortable in the tyranny.
[03:18:29.244 --> 03:18:31.785]  We're so close to it, we almost become it.
[03:18:32.505 --> 03:18:34.826]  Where just legendary stuff is happening.
[03:18:35.286 --> 03:18:37.286]  All of us, patriots, listeners, leaders.
[03:18:38.127 --> 03:18:42.428]  You need to, people like James Woods, who's eloquent and smart, he needs to be on TV and radio fighting.
[03:18:44.639 --> 03:18:45.960]  Chuck Norris needs to go public.
[03:18:46.480 --> 03:18:47.841]  I know Chuck's probably listening right now.
[03:18:47.941 --> 03:18:48.641]  I love Chuck Norris.
[03:18:48.701 --> 03:18:49.561]  I know he's a tough guy.
[03:18:49.822 --> 03:18:50.322]  A patriot.
[03:18:50.482 --> 03:18:50.982]  Done a lot.
[03:18:51.182 --> 03:18:52.203]  Writes for WorldNet daily.
[03:18:52.863 --> 03:18:55.885]  But Chuck, your own family wants you to come out and speak out.
[03:18:56.845 --> 03:18:58.786]  And he doesn't not do it because he's afraid.
[03:18:59.286 --> 03:19:00.727]  He just is such a perfectionist.
[03:19:00.767 --> 03:19:02.808]  He thinks other people might be better than him at doing it.
[03:19:03.168 --> 03:19:03.408]  No!
[03:19:03.709 --> 03:19:06.550]  It doesn't matter whether you are the best at what you do.
[03:19:07.050 --> 03:19:08.531]  You gotta do it now.
[03:19:10.212 --> 03:19:11.212]  We're gonna skip this network break.
[03:19:11.232 --> 03:19:13.874]  This is the fourth hour and I got David Knight here with me.
[03:19:15.063 --> 03:19:22.285]  David, the main focus is, and I know I'm guilty of this, getting distracted by the Bundy thing itself, because I was trying to stop that getting out of control.
[03:19:22.325 --> 03:19:33.747]  I think people know that stinks now, so things are a little bit more, I think, stabilized, at least for now, as we try to sabotage globalist operations to get a war going, and we're working around the clock on that.
[03:19:34.067 --> 03:19:36.868]  But the big issue is, man, it's really happening.
[03:19:38.048 --> 03:19:45.372]  And boy, you know Republicans are going to continue this power grab if we don't shoot it down and punish out of control executive authority now.
[03:19:48.413 --> 03:19:56.738]  It is just, it's all about the executive power grab, impeach him now, announcing basically legal actions outside of law.
[03:19:58.703 --> 03:20:04.725]  I mean, if you're on a no-fly database that's totally unconstitutional, you're on a no-gun-by list, this is so incredible.
[03:20:05.125 --> 03:20:17.869]  And with everything else, the open border, the Border Patrol completing the smuggling process, the bringing in the refugees and not vetting them, ordering JFK and other airports to just let people from Latin America in without even looking at their IDs.
[03:20:18.549 --> 03:20:22.170]  I mean, this is lawless invasion and takedown.
[03:20:23.070 --> 03:20:26.573]  And illustrates what else is going on we don't know about.
[03:20:26.593 --> 03:20:49.210]  I know you've got a full slate today, David, but I really need listeners to go to InfoWarsTore.com and whether it's a Hillary for Prison t-shirt, or a Molon Labe t-shirt, or a seed bank for the spring coming up, or 15% off on everything on the site till Friday, nutraceuticals, we have the new, I haven't even talked about this, we have the new

[03:20:56.300 --> 03:21:00.301]  Got Leanne McAdoo there as the 1940s, uh, World War II pin-up.
[03:21:01.342 --> 03:21:04.763]  Uh, I tell ya, we just, good Lord, that's a lot of great creations.
[03:21:05.203 --> 03:21:10.105]  And then we've got, uh, huge discounts each month that are only in this.

[03:21:31.601 --> 03:21:37.203]  Free domestic shipping in October, 10% off InfoWars select promo code.

[03:21:51.012 --> 03:21:54.514]  And, and you have funded us.
[03:21:54.534 --> 03:21:55.414]  You've done a great job.
[03:21:56.455 --> 03:22:01.218]  Um, if I had a lot more money, I'd really do aggressive stuff politically.
[03:22:02.339 --> 03:22:02.660]  I don't know.
[03:22:20.464 --> 03:22:22.505]  I'm sitting on the, basically put my arms on the keyboard.
[03:22:23.466 --> 03:22:40.217]  I'm just up here flailing around like a watchman on the wall, watching them burn our culture down, burn our energy sources, annihilate our families, just running around saying your kids belong to us, foaming at the mouth, they're coming for our guns, they hate us bitter clingers.
[03:22:40.357 --> 03:22:43.259]  I mean, it's just these criminal villains.
[03:22:43.279 --> 03:22:48.403]  And then I learned from FBI sources, Secret Service sources,
[03:22:52.093 --> 03:22:53.954]  That Obama is indeed a Wahhabist.
[03:22:54.214 --> 03:22:58.335]  I mean, that's just... And it's people seeing it for themselves.
[03:22:58.535 --> 03:23:07.438]  I mean, it's... This guy hates freedom and hates this country and absolutely despises everyone.
[03:23:07.478 --> 03:23:11.079]  These are whacked-out, chip-on-their-shoulder lunatics.
[03:23:12.557 --> 03:23:19.263]  And they're not gonna, he's not gonna leave office without trying to bring the country down, folks, unless we really get in their face.
[03:23:19.904 --> 03:23:21.145]  Look, he's been repudiated.
[03:23:21.185 --> 03:23:22.366]  Gun control's unpopular.
[03:23:22.706 --> 03:23:23.707]  Abortion's unpopular.
[03:23:23.787 --> 03:23:27.471]  All his stuff, 2% of Americans in Gallup Poll want it.
[03:23:28.251 --> 03:23:29.733]  But they won't stop.
[03:23:31.314 --> 03:23:32.315]  They won't stop.
[03:23:32.856 --> 03:23:34.077]  Because they're committed.
[03:23:35.515 --> 03:23:42.859]  And we've got to have a fighting spirit politically to run around and to get these articles and videos and stuff out to everybody.
[03:23:43.200 --> 03:23:47.862]  And as soon as I hand the baton to David Knight, I'm going to go in there and shoot stuff for the news.
[03:23:48.223 --> 03:23:49.503]  I'm going to shoot Facebook mentions.
[03:23:49.844 --> 03:23:50.664]  I'm going to do it all.
[03:23:51.585 --> 03:23:57.028]  And we're going to keep jacking into the enemy operations, but have our own platforms to launch these operations from.
[03:23:57.088 --> 03:23:58.789]  So we've got a lot of systems.
[03:23:59.089 --> 03:24:03.452]  So when they take one out, cut one head off, two more replace it.
[03:24:05.230 --> 03:24:06.933]  And you can know we're committed.
[03:24:06.953 --> 03:24:07.935]  I can feel your prayers.
[03:24:08.255 --> 03:24:09.237]  I can see your support.
[03:24:09.257 --> 03:24:10.258]  Keep spreading the word.
[03:24:10.539 --> 03:24:11.761]  Keep spreading our videos.
[03:24:11.821 --> 03:24:13.484]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:24:13.704 --> 03:24:14.906]  Keep spreading those links.
[03:24:15.167 --> 03:24:16.829]  And I want to thank you for all you've done.
[03:24:17.090 --> 03:24:18.332]  I want to commit to you.
[03:24:19.372 --> 03:24:30.679]  As you've committed to us that I will not falter or waver and I will 110% go with the facts and my gut and the spirit and will never hold back from you or anybody.
[03:24:30.980 --> 03:24:34.162]  Because it's all being done right in front of the creator of the universe.
[03:24:34.862 --> 03:24:39.565]  That I can see my whole life trained me and prepared me and got me ready.
[03:24:40.546 --> 03:24:43.508]  And it takes all types to defeat this tyranny, but I am a warrior.
[03:24:44.708 --> 03:24:47.769]  Ready to take on the enemy and I will never surrender.
[03:24:48.309 --> 03:24:51.350]  I will never back down until this body fails.
[03:24:51.931 --> 03:24:54.451]  But the flesh is designed to fail and go back into the earth.
[03:24:54.471 --> 03:24:55.672]  It's fertilizer.
[03:24:55.972 --> 03:24:57.392]  The spirit is transcendent.
[03:24:57.792 --> 03:25:00.713]  David Knight, we just have to be emblematic.
[03:25:00.753 --> 03:25:02.134]  We have to have the talking points.
[03:25:02.234 --> 03:25:03.194]  It's epic.
[03:25:03.574 --> 03:25:04.055]  It's here.
[03:25:04.535 --> 03:25:10.537]  All the other tyranny was meant to condition us with learned helplessness and normalcy bias and mass Stockholm Syndrome.
[03:25:11.577 --> 03:25:18.899]  And we just all have to realize the incredible history we're witnessing, the acceleration of the takedown of this country, David.
[03:25:19.120 --> 03:25:20.820]  I mean, what do you think's coming next?
[03:25:21.140 --> 03:25:29.403]  Like, Drudge was told by the Supreme Court Justice this year, he was told last year, but we're now in 2016, that they're coming after the First Amendment too.
[03:25:30.382 --> 03:25:33.863]  I mean, they're trying to ban people being able to travel for their speech.
[03:25:34.003 --> 03:25:36.124]  I mean, this is serious.
[03:25:36.924 --> 03:25:38.665]  It's a full-spectrum attack, Alex.
[03:25:38.705 --> 03:25:46.027]  You're talking about them coming after our ability to have freedom of speech as well as the freedom to read, to educate ourselves.
[03:25:46.727 --> 03:25:51.849]  But Alex, you know, I think it's interesting because they use this left-right divide, you know.
[03:25:51.909 --> 03:25:57.732]  They can push any kind of authoritarian tactic through for the left if they're coming after guns.
[03:25:57.832 --> 03:26:02.454]  For the right, they can do anything that they want to no matter how criminal, no matter how unconstitutional.
[03:26:02.734 --> 03:26:07.039]  If they're coming after drugs, because people on the right don't like drugs, people on the left don't like guns.
[03:26:07.339 --> 03:26:10.263]  We have to understand what the underlying principles are.
[03:26:10.303 --> 03:26:21.116]  And Alex, when I look at these executive orders from Obama, just as you're talking about with Cabela's using gun stores to snitch on people, we've seen that being done with CISA.
[03:26:21.636 --> 03:26:25.439]  Telling ISPs, telling social media, telling your phone company.
[03:26:25.519 --> 03:26:25.980]  That's right.
[03:26:26.080 --> 03:26:27.181]  Turn this information to us.
[03:26:27.201 --> 03:26:27.441]  That's right.
[03:26:27.541 --> 03:26:31.905]  You're responsible for what people do on your service to spy on them and break the law.
[03:26:32.025 --> 03:26:32.105]  Yes.
[03:26:32.125 --> 03:26:33.766]  And they're trying to pass a law to do it.
[03:26:34.127 --> 03:26:36.469]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[03:26:36.829 --> 03:26:42.355]  Taking away these people, the civil liability that they would have for spying on you.
[03:26:42.676 --> 03:26:48.242]  We have to understand that when somebody collects information about you, that still is your information.
[03:26:48.762 --> 03:26:50.524]  And we need to recognize that that's privacy.
[03:26:50.584 --> 03:26:53.748]  Now they're going after the doctor-patient relationship.
[03:26:53.828 --> 03:26:57.933]  Encouraging and telling them they're not going to hold them responsible if they spy on you and that.
[03:26:58.793 --> 03:27:03.718]  That ought to be obnoxious to liberals, to say you're going to destroy the Dr. Patient Pillar.
[03:27:03.758 --> 03:27:04.799]  They're on a Nazi power trip.
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:06.121]  They feel they're rising.
[03:27:06.341 --> 03:27:07.022]  It's a great evil.
[03:27:07.262 --> 03:27:10.045]  They love the jihadists killing Christians and raping women.
[03:27:10.065 --> 03:27:10.585]  I'm serious.
[03:27:10.625 --> 03:27:14.009]  They hate the West and they just get off on it.
[03:27:14.069 --> 03:27:14.769]  It's a cuckolding.
[03:27:14.789 --> 03:27:17.752]  But what about the point, David, about emblematic?
[03:27:18.233 --> 03:27:18.793]  We need to
[03:27:19.734 --> 03:27:24.559]  All of that is part of the takeover, but the issue is the hammer's coming down now.
[03:27:24.659 --> 03:27:26.981]  We need to move for impeachment against Obama.
[03:27:27.502 --> 03:27:29.383]  We need to get this article out to everybody.
[03:27:29.423 --> 03:27:31.425]  We need more articles, reports on the news.
[03:27:31.745 --> 03:27:32.867]  We need videos about.
[03:27:33.147 --> 03:27:35.069]  We must impeach Obama now.
[03:27:35.569 --> 03:27:37.310]  Congress moving to impeach Obama.
[03:27:37.330 --> 03:27:38.631]  We need to hear him go public.
[03:27:38.931 --> 03:27:41.573]  Report, RNC will consider Obama impeachment proceedings.
[03:27:41.933 --> 03:27:45.676]  Resolution consists of 48 criminal charges of North American Law Center.
[03:27:45.696 --> 03:27:46.636]  I want to get them on.
[03:27:46.656 --> 03:27:47.897]  This is it.
[03:27:48.137 --> 03:27:52.180]  David Knight, I'm handing the baton over to you for the next 30-35 minutes or so.
[03:27:52.240 --> 03:27:54.181]  Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[03:27:54.201 --> 03:27:55.882]  It's not even hot in here, folks, and I'm sweating.
[03:27:55.962 --> 03:27:56.163]  I mean...
[03:27:56.923 --> 03:28:05.933]  I mean, this is like being French or something and the Germans just took over your country, or being Russian and the Huns invade, I mean, or being in Hungary and the Muslims invade.
[03:28:06.033 --> 03:28:11.780]  I mean, I always knew the globalists hated us, but man, they really are out to get everybody.
[03:28:12.080 --> 03:28:12.521]  David Knight.
[03:28:12.981 --> 03:28:13.641]  Absolutely, Alex.
[03:28:13.701 --> 03:28:17.063]  And of course, in that article they said, well, here's 48 things.
[03:28:17.083 --> 03:28:18.944]  I'm sure you could get a much longer list than that.
[03:28:19.004 --> 03:28:21.245]  And that's been accumulating for years.
[03:28:21.986 --> 03:28:27.048]  What Obama is doing just with the IRS, that was something that Richard Nixon was impeached for, and rightfully so.
[03:28:27.728 --> 03:28:29.889]  But Obama has done this to a far greater extent.
[03:28:29.929 --> 03:28:31.590]  He's done it with the cooperation of the IRS.
[03:28:31.630 --> 03:28:35.572]  It was actually an IRS commissioner who said, hey, look, he wants you to spy on enemies.
[03:28:35.612 --> 03:28:36.693]  So they took him down that way.
[03:28:36.713 --> 03:28:39.074]  There were a lot of things that were going on with Richard Nixon.
[03:28:39.394 --> 03:28:40.635]  To some degree, it was a coup.
[03:28:41.255 --> 03:28:44.356]  Nevertheless, when we tolerate that kind of behavior, we're going to get more of it.
[03:28:44.376 --> 03:28:54.220]  And the reason we're tolerating that is because I believe, and we all have seen, that there is absolutely no difference between the Republican leadership and the Democratic leadership in Congress.
[03:28:54.460 --> 03:28:56.601]  They've abdicated their authority, they've turned this over.
[03:28:57.141 --> 03:29:01.583]  When you look at the gun control issue, as we pointed out yesterday with Jakari Jackson on here as we're looking at it,
[03:29:02.063 --> 03:29:07.490]  Over and over again, whenever they talk about this, they don't talk about the fact that they're removing your freedoms.
[03:29:07.790 --> 03:29:12.175]  They don't talk about the fact that they don't care what your elected representatives want.
[03:29:12.215 --> 03:29:14.097]  That's what Congress is, theoretically.
[03:29:14.398 --> 03:29:17.601]  Obama says, I'm frustrated because Congress won't do what I tell them to do.
[03:29:17.842 --> 03:29:19.163]  And it's because of that gun lobby.
[03:29:19.884 --> 03:29:35.965]  Well, you know, the gun lobby, organizations like the NRA, Gun Owners of America, other institutions like that, they are supported by individuals who are trying to get them to fight for their rights, trying to get them to put a backbone in these congressmen, trying to stop these unconstitutional power grabs.
[03:29:36.405 --> 03:29:40.368]  And so maybe we ought to start referring to the other people as the statist lobby.
[03:29:40.948 --> 03:29:42.730]  Or maybe as the tyranny lobby.
[03:29:43.270 --> 03:29:46.553]  But you know, we talk about the gun lobby and say, what an evil thing that is.
[03:29:46.593 --> 03:29:52.577]  What he's saying is, he doesn't want the people to have any representation in regulation.
[03:29:52.897 --> 03:29:55.820]  Instead, he wants to do it by himself, with executive order.
[03:29:56.260 --> 03:30:01.224]  Now when we come back, we're going to be taking a look at Harry Reid wanting to use the Social Fund Retirement Fund.
[03:30:10.786 --> 03:30:22.877]  While President Obama attempts to enact gun control via executive action, a new Gallup poll shows that only 2% of Americans believe that guns or gun control are among the country's top problems.
[03:30:23.257 --> 03:30:26.360]  Gallup asked about 1,000 Americans in all 50 states
[03:30:26.960 --> 03:30:36.466]  What they thought the nation's top problems were in 2015, and out of 23 problems mentioned by Americans, guns, gun control, ranked near the bottom at 19th.
[03:30:36.926 --> 03:30:48.033]  In comparison, 16% of Americans said that the government was the nation's biggest issue, 13% said the economy, 8% said unemployment, and another 8% said immigration.
[03:30:48.573 --> 03:30:56.099]  But rather than working on these hot-button issues, both President Obama and the mainstream media would rather focus on gun control.
[03:30:56.500 --> 03:31:03.545]  With the President even stating that he wants to, quote, make gun control part of his legacy, end quote, according to CNN.

[03:32:19.524 --> 03:32:24.128]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.

[03:32:51.724 --> 03:32:52.204]  We're good.
[03:33:13.860 --> 03:33:15.322]  We are on the march.
[03:33:15.702 --> 03:33:18.105]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:33:18.866 --> 03:33:22.550]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:26.198 --> 03:33:27.438]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:27.458 --> 03:33:33.700]  I'm David Knight, your host for this last half hour of what is now a regular four-hour broadcast.
[03:33:33.760 --> 03:33:37.241]  I'm going to get back to what Obama is doing, and I want to look at it from a different angle.
[03:33:37.321 --> 03:33:46.844]  I want to give you something that you can talk to, and I'm going to be talking to our liberal listeners out there, because I know that we have people who are not just conservatives or libertarians.
[03:33:46.864 --> 03:33:49.665]  I know we have liberals who listen to us, because we talk about a lot of issues.
[03:33:50.325 --> 03:33:51.926]  That they support as well.
[03:33:52.147 --> 03:33:54.569]  And we need to make common cause with this.
[03:33:54.609 --> 03:34:05.899]  We need to stop letting them break us down into political parties and getting excited because we got the same letter behind that candidate's name, or we got the same team colors, or we're different colors from each other.
[03:34:05.919 --> 03:34:08.822]  We need to come together and understand how they're pwning us.
[03:34:08.862 --> 03:34:15.187]  And when I look at this gun control legislation, one of the first things that sticks out to me is the medical tyranny aspect of it.
[03:34:16.108 --> 03:34:17.249]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:34:17.569 --> 03:34:32.281]  Not only violating the doctor-patient privilege, but also turning psychologists and the medical community, turning them into essentially judges who can do all kinds of things in terms of removing your property, sending you to
[03:34:33.782 --> 03:34:40.867]  Presumably, we'll get to the point where we were in the Soviet Union, where they can incarcerate you based on quick assessments.
[03:34:41.307 --> 03:34:43.129]  Just completely getting rid of due process.
[03:34:43.629 --> 03:34:47.031]  Eliminating privacy, confiscating privacy, confiscating your consent.
[03:34:47.232 --> 03:34:48.152]  That's what you need to understand.
[03:34:48.212 --> 03:34:50.114]  It's not just gun confiscation.
[03:34:50.394 --> 03:34:52.015]  It's privacy confiscation.
[03:34:52.535 --> 03:34:55.457]  It's confiscation of your informed consent.
[03:34:55.497 --> 03:34:58.339]  And they're working on that in a number of different ways.
[03:34:58.359 --> 03:35:00.060]  I mean, Benjamin Rush, one of the
[03:35:01.181 --> 03:35:03.905]  People who was involved in the development of the Constitution was very adamant.
[03:35:03.925 --> 03:35:04.465]  He was a doctor.
[03:35:04.485 --> 03:35:11.134]  He says, if we don't put something in the Constitution specifically protecting people's medical rights, we're going to have a medical tyranny.
[03:35:11.174 --> 03:35:12.055]  Well, here it is, folks.
[03:35:12.576 --> 03:35:15.940]  We've seen this throughout the Obama administration in so many different ways.
[03:35:16.881 --> 03:35:20.122]  And people said, well, we've got the 9th and the 10th Amendment, and they did.
[03:35:20.422 --> 03:35:22.143]  And it should be sufficient to stop that.
[03:35:22.223 --> 03:35:23.964]  But nothing will stop these people.
[03:35:24.004 --> 03:35:27.565]  We're going to have to, I believe, not look to Washington for solutions.
[03:35:27.925 --> 03:35:30.146]  We need to look to ourselves for solutions.
[03:35:30.466 --> 03:35:32.727]  We need to understand things like jury nullification.
[03:35:32.747 --> 03:35:38.309]  This whole massive injustice that was done to the Hammond family could have been stopped with jury nullification.
[03:35:38.849 --> 03:35:43.816]  It got to the point where the judge says, this absolutely offends my conscience, my sensibility.
[03:35:43.836 --> 03:35:48.522]  He refused to do the mandatory minimum that was imposed by Washington.
[03:35:49.043 --> 03:35:49.844]  That's what they overturned.
[03:35:49.864 --> 03:35:51.766]  That's why they're going back to jail the second time.
[03:35:51.807 --> 03:35:54.370]  And so he tried to move against that.
[03:35:54.410 --> 03:35:56.132]  But the people who really had the authority...
[03:35:56.673 --> 03:35:57.253]  We're the jury.
[03:35:57.834 --> 03:35:58.755]  They didn't know their power.
[03:35:59.095 --> 03:36:00.035]  They didn't know their duty.
[03:36:00.536 --> 03:36:02.978]  We have to know what the power is that we have.
[03:36:03.038 --> 03:36:05.800]  We have tremendous power laying on the ground.
[03:36:05.840 --> 03:36:06.780]  We just need to pick it up.
[03:36:07.081 --> 03:36:11.604]  Now before I go to the gun control issue, I want to point out what happened in Michigan.
[03:36:11.644 --> 03:36:18.749]  And some of you may have noticed that there is a state of emergency in Flint, Michigan's water supply.
[03:36:19.309 --> 03:36:22.632]  Now it was a state of emergency was declared by the mayor.
[03:36:23.935 --> 03:36:31.002]  Less than a month ago, now the governor, Rick Snyder, has declared a state of emergency over Flint, Michigan's contaminated drinking water.
[03:36:31.042 --> 03:36:38.609]  This is a story that's on IT, and they point out that the city's water is causing elevated levels of lead in children.
[03:36:39.330 --> 03:36:40.611]  Now, think about that, okay?
[03:36:41.011 --> 03:36:45.015]  This is the water supply provided for you by the government, and we just saw the EPA
[03:36:46.030 --> 03:36:48.391]  Explode a gold mine unnecessarily.
[03:36:48.451 --> 03:36:49.692]  They were warned about it in advance.
[03:36:49.712 --> 03:36:59.336]  As a matter of fact, a retired mining engineer said, I know precisely what is going to happen with this, and I know you want this to happen, so you can increase your little Superfund empire that's going on here.
[03:36:59.356 --> 03:37:00.036]  He warned them about it.
[03:37:00.296 --> 03:37:01.097]  They did it anyway.
[03:37:01.357 --> 03:37:10.161]  They polluted the Animas River, which polluted three states and Navajo Reservation with arsenic and other heavy metals that were in there.
[03:37:10.601 --> 03:37:15.243]  Now we have the situation where the city of Flint, Michigan switched from the Detroit water supply
[03:37:16.143 --> 03:37:18.465]  To the Flint River as their water source.
[03:37:18.685 --> 03:37:22.828]  And then what they discovered was elevation in the levels of lead.
[03:37:22.888 --> 03:37:23.948]  Especially in children.
[03:37:23.988 --> 03:37:24.769]  But in everybody.
[03:37:24.949 --> 03:37:25.749]  But especially children.
[03:37:25.769 --> 03:37:26.850]  They're more susceptible to this.
[03:37:27.230 --> 03:37:34.114]  They said the situation became a full-blown crisis when during the summer of 2015 rising levels of lead were being detected in children's blood.
[03:37:34.154 --> 03:37:42.640]  A pediatrician told RT that the highest readings she and the state had recorded for elevated blood levels in Flint were 38 micrograms per deciliter.
[03:37:43.280 --> 03:37:47.601]  Seven times higher than a level that is classified as elevated by the CDC.
[03:37:47.701 --> 03:37:49.901]  Now, this is the issue.
[03:37:49.941 --> 03:37:52.862]  We know that lead takes away your IQ points.
[03:37:52.902 --> 03:38:02.243]  And we've had research from Harvard and other institutions that talk about the association of declining IQ when you put fluoride in the water.
[03:38:02.403 --> 03:38:02.724]  Okay?
[03:38:02.764 --> 03:38:05.264]  This particular thing, I don't think they did that deliberately.
[03:38:05.284 --> 03:38:10.305]  They didn't say, let's switch to the Flint River so we can put lead in the water supply.
[03:38:11.015 --> 03:38:17.817]  But we've got city governments all over this country that are deliberately putting fluoride in the water supply.
[03:38:17.877 --> 03:38:18.958]  And the bottom line is this.
[03:38:19.718 --> 03:38:22.579]  You have a responsibility to take care of yourself and your family.
[03:38:23.039 --> 03:38:24.359]  And there are ways that you can do that.
[03:38:25.200 --> 03:38:34.463]  You need to not wait until somebody says, oh, you know what, this weird thing that's going on with your health, we just tested your blood and you got an elevated level of X.
[03:38:35.063 --> 03:38:36.104]  Whatever it is, okay?
[03:38:36.144 --> 03:38:40.826]  Pick a toxic substance or heavy metal or something that you're being exposed to.
[03:38:40.946 --> 03:38:42.667]  You need to filter your water.
[03:38:42.687 --> 03:38:45.569]  It doesn't matter if you're on a city water supply or a well.
[03:38:45.649 --> 03:38:47.170]  You still need to filter your water.
[03:38:47.190 --> 03:38:52.173]  When they polluted the Reanimus River, it was polluting people's well systems as well, okay?
[03:38:52.373 --> 03:38:54.114]  Not just the people who are in the city.
[03:38:54.434 --> 03:38:56.916]  That's why you need a good quality water filter.
[03:38:56.936 --> 03:39:02.859]  And that's why I wanted to talk about this story because people need to understand you need to act proactively.
[03:39:03.039 --> 03:39:04.060]  You need to be prepared.
[03:39:04.440 --> 03:39:10.486]  You need to prepare for emergencies, but you know that in most cases there is runoff that's going into your water.
[03:39:10.526 --> 03:39:12.869]  You need to do something about that for your family.
[03:39:12.889 --> 03:39:14.130]  Now is a great time to do it.
[03:39:14.610 --> 03:39:17.814]  As we pointed out, Alex was just talking about this in the last segment, we got 15% off.
[03:39:18.094 --> 03:39:21.878]  This is a great time to start out the new year with clean water.
[03:39:21.918 --> 03:39:23.960]  We've got a variety of water filters that you can get.
[03:39:24.000 --> 03:39:27.564]  Some you can use while you're traveling, or some like this particular filter here.
[03:39:28.124 --> 03:39:31.265]  Alexa Pure, where you can do that at home, filter everything that you're drinking.
[03:39:31.285 --> 03:39:33.826]  You need to guard your family's health.
[03:39:33.966 --> 03:39:35.247]  It's very important to do that.
[03:39:35.987 --> 03:39:37.248]  Now is the time for you to do that.
[03:39:37.288 --> 03:39:42.950]  We've got a 15% off sale through the rest of this week on everything at the Infowars store.
[03:39:43.070 --> 03:39:48.212]  And that's one thing that is really vital to make sure that you have is fresh, pure water.
[03:39:48.292 --> 03:39:54.114]  Something that is going to be available to you with a gravity feed filter, even if you lose power.
[03:39:55.404 --> 03:39:57.945]  Now quickly, I want to go back to this Obama gun grab.
[03:39:58.285 --> 03:40:01.987]  And I want to look at it first from this legislative aspect.
[03:40:02.047 --> 03:40:07.009]  Of course, he doesn't want to wait around for the Congress to do what he wants to do.
[03:40:07.049 --> 03:40:08.589]  He doesn't like what the Congress is doing.
[03:40:08.949 --> 03:40:10.330]  He doesn't like what the current laws are.
[03:40:10.710 --> 03:40:11.991]  He doesn't like the Second Amendment.
[03:40:12.071 --> 03:40:15.152]  So he's going to act on his own and say, we don't like that gun lobby.
[03:40:15.192 --> 03:40:17.113]  Well, the gun lobby represents people.
[03:40:17.773 --> 03:40:20.414]  These bureaucracies that he's going to be using don't.
[03:40:21.564 --> 03:40:23.845]  You didn't elect anybody in the ATF.
[03:40:23.945 --> 03:40:26.526]  You didn't elect anybody in the EPA or the BLM.
[03:40:27.246 --> 03:40:31.428]  These are perpetual agencies that persist regardless of who is president.
[03:40:31.448 --> 03:40:33.509]  This isn't going to go away when Obama leaves.
[03:40:33.889 --> 03:40:34.109]  Okay?
[03:40:34.129 --> 03:40:39.051]  He's just abusing it in different ways than a Republican is going to abuse the bureaucracies.
[03:40:39.111 --> 03:40:42.972]  Republicans will grab a different agency and abuse the power in another way.
[03:40:43.012 --> 03:40:47.434]  That's why liberals and conservatives need to come together and say we're not going to allow
[03:40:48.294 --> 03:40:50.116]  Regulation without representation.
[03:40:50.637 --> 03:40:52.839]  Anymore we're going to allow taxation without representation.
[03:40:52.859 --> 03:41:02.670]  But when we have these bureaucratic empires building their little fiefdoms, extending their control over paper airplanes, over the internet one day, over your water supply the next day with the EPA.
[03:41:03.251 --> 03:41:05.073]  Every week it's a new power grab.
[03:41:05.213 --> 03:41:07.015]  One is more absurd than the other.
[03:41:07.155 --> 03:41:11.479]  And of course they're all being directed and encouraged at this point by Obama.
[03:41:11.640 --> 03:41:14.282]  It'll be, same thing will happen when a Republican will get in.
[03:41:14.322 --> 03:41:17.866]  You know that they're not going to undo all of his regulations.
[03:41:17.886 --> 03:41:20.789]  They're just going to add their own and leave the other ones in place.
[03:41:21.510 --> 03:41:26.194]  So let's take a look at what he's saying, because what he is doing here is saying, I'm not happy.
[03:41:26.795 --> 03:41:30.438]  With the fact that you've got people in Congress and we've got laws.
[03:41:31.099 --> 03:41:34.622]  They're not doing what I want to do in terms of changing, remaking the country.
[03:41:34.662 --> 03:41:40.506]  So I'm going to work with the bureaucracy to do it without any input from the people.
[03:41:41.007 --> 03:41:43.749]  Because when they talk about the gun lobby, that's you.
[03:41:44.870 --> 03:41:46.852]  That's the people who are members of the NRA.
[03:41:47.512 --> 03:41:50.114]  People who are members of the gun owners of America.
[03:41:50.314 --> 03:41:51.735]  And all these other organizations.
[03:41:52.115 --> 03:41:52.656]  That's you.
[03:41:53.477 --> 03:41:55.318]  They want to ignore that representation.
[03:41:55.338 --> 03:41:57.439]  They want to ignore your congressional representation.
[03:41:57.720 --> 03:41:59.601]  And they want to do whatever they wish.
[03:41:59.641 --> 03:42:06.186]  Let's play those clips where you see how Obama has said one thing, and now he's saying another about this.
[03:42:07.087 --> 03:42:08.127]  You hear some of these quotes.
[03:42:08.548 --> 03:42:10.389]  I need a gun to protect myself from the government.
[03:42:13.131 --> 03:42:13.752]  We can't do
[03:42:14.873 --> 03:42:18.859]  Background checks because the government's gonna come take my guns away.
[03:42:24.627 --> 03:42:25.268]  The government's us.
[03:42:27.211 --> 03:42:30.456]  These officials are elected by you.
[03:42:37.105 --> 03:42:39.226]  They are elected by you, I am elected by you.
[03:42:39.306 --> 03:42:42.007]  I'm constrained as they are constrained.
[03:42:42.127 --> 03:42:43.568]  Yeah, so is our Congress elected by us.
[03:42:43.588 --> 03:42:45.328]  By a system that our founders put in place.
[03:42:45.709 --> 03:42:47.489]  It's a government of and by and for the people.
[03:42:50.771 --> 03:43:05.977]  And so surely we can have a debate that's not based on the notion somehow that your elected representatives are trying to do something to you other than potentially prevent
[03:43:08.504 --> 03:43:16.206]  Another group of families from... We don't have a direct democracy, we have a republic with guaranteed protections of individual liberty, too.
[03:43:17.706 --> 03:43:21.327]  Now I want to be clear, Congress still needs to act.
[03:43:21.487 --> 03:43:22.647]  Now here's the new Obama.
[03:43:24.127 --> 03:43:26.708]  The folks in this room will not rest until Congress does.
[03:43:34.630 --> 03:43:36.410]  Because once Congress gets on board,
[03:43:37.205 --> 03:43:46.632]  With common sense gun safety measures, we can reduce gun violence a whole lot more.
[03:43:49.253 --> 03:43:50.194]  But we also can't wait.
[03:43:52.916 --> 03:44:04.484]  Until we have a Congress that's in line with the majority of Americans, there are actions within my legal authority that we can take to help reduce gun violence to save more lives.
[03:44:05.641 --> 03:44:08.383]  Actions that protect our rights and our kids.
[03:44:10.985 --> 03:44:27.078]  After Sandy Hook, Joe and I worked together with our teams and we put forward a whole series of executive actions to try to tighten up the existing rules and systems that we had in place.
[03:44:28.019 --> 03:44:33.183]  Okay, and as I pointed out yesterday when we were talking to Ja'Kari Jackson and I were looking at this gun regulation,
[03:44:34.051 --> 03:44:37.813]  I pointed out that in the 1950s, Harry Truman was in the middle of the Korean War.
[03:44:38.674 --> 03:44:43.756]  They were very concerned about the supply of steel, and there was labor unrest in the steel business.
[03:44:43.796 --> 03:44:47.819]  They had labor unions, and steel mill owners were at loggerheads.
[03:44:48.379 --> 03:44:50.320]  They tried to work it out.
[03:44:51.060 --> 03:44:58.544]  At the national level, they were unsuccessful, so Harry Truman issued an executive order, said, I'm going to take the steel mills and put them under federal control.
[03:44:59.225 --> 03:45:02.727]  The mills sued and went to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court slapped him down.
[03:45:03.467 --> 03:45:06.010]  They said there's some things that you can't do with executive orders.
[03:45:06.731 --> 03:45:09.694]  If you don't have the authority given to you, you can't do it.
[03:45:09.774 --> 03:45:23.628]  And if you're trying to do something that is against the will of the people, as expressed by the Congress, if they have expressly put out that their will is not to do this thing, then you don't have the authority to do it.
[03:45:24.440 --> 03:45:25.981]  And so that's precisely what's happening.
[03:45:26.001 --> 03:45:50.419]  Now, when Obama looks at this, and he wants to give carte blanche to medical professionals to declare people as mentally ill, understand that in the 1993 Brady Law, it already prohibited ownership by those who are involuntarily committed, those who were found incompetent to stand trial, otherwise deemed by the court to be a danger to themselves or others, but it prohibited doctors from violating the privacy of their clients.
[03:45:51.707 --> 03:45:51.968]  Okay?
[03:45:52.489 --> 03:45:53.111]  Of their patients.
[03:45:53.432 --> 03:45:54.274]  That is very important.
[03:45:54.615 --> 03:45:58.325]  Now when we go in and we say that we're going to ban people from buying guns if they're mentally ill...
[03:45:59.333 --> 03:46:04.697]  As Kit Daniels brilliantly pointed out yesterday, Obama could ban himself from buying guns.
[03:46:04.877 --> 03:46:11.721]  Because we've had a psychologist issue an opinion back in 2004 which said, you know, I think he's got some serious problems.
[03:46:11.762 --> 03:46:13.523]  And let me read you what he had in this article.
[03:46:13.543 --> 03:46:28.393]  He says, back in 2014, psychology expert Dr. Gina Loudon indicated Obama's decision to trade five high-risk Taliban leaders for Army Sergeant Bo Bergdahl was an irrational decision that you'd expect from someone with mental issues.
[03:46:29.133 --> 03:46:29.233]  And
[03:46:45.908 --> 03:46:48.189]  Your behavior seems very irrational to me.
[03:46:48.209 --> 03:46:51.529]  It seems beyond that of just typical narcissistic arrogance.
[03:46:52.190 --> 03:46:52.430]  Okay?
[03:46:52.450 --> 03:46:57.491]  She says, I'm like, I'm the leader of a big country, and I feel tyrannical at the moment, that kind of attitude.
[03:46:57.511 --> 03:47:07.954]  She says, it really seems to me like this president is demonstrating behavior that's not only anti-American, but irrational, erratic, perhaps not exactly what we might want to deem as sane.
[03:47:08.174 --> 03:47:08.594]  Well, okay.
[03:47:08.614 --> 03:47:09.974]  So that's just her opinion.
[03:47:10.834 --> 03:47:13.415]  If you like Obama, you're just going to say, that's just one person's opinion.
[03:47:14.582 --> 03:47:21.065]  It only takes one person's opinion to take away your rights if we allow him to do this by executive order.
[03:47:21.145 --> 03:47:23.366]  That was the point that Kit Daniels was making.
[03:47:23.746 --> 03:47:27.968]  And he said, interestingly, when Obama announced the rules on Tuesday, he referred to himself 76 times.
[03:47:28.008 --> 03:47:29.589]  I would say, ironically.
[03:47:30.169 --> 03:47:50.349]  When he did that he referred to himself as 76 times because there's an artistic personality disorder characterized by a long-standing pattern of grandiosity either in fantasy or in actual behavior an overwhelming need for admiration usually a complete lack of empathy towards others and of course he's quoting that from a psych definition look
[03:47:50.990 --> 03:47:57.413]  You can find some doctor, some psychologist who will write up pretty much anybody if you put enough pressure on them.
[03:47:57.854 --> 03:48:04.037]  Just like they can pressure your phone company, your internet service provider, the social media websites that you go to.
[03:48:04.057 --> 03:48:09.880]  They can put pressure on anybody to give them information about you, to twist information about you.
[03:48:10.540 --> 03:48:11.601]  That's what's so dangerous.
[03:48:12.421 --> 03:48:12.922]  About this.
[03:48:13.342 --> 03:48:18.526]  That's why you should be concerned about this, regardless of your position on guns.
[03:48:19.286 --> 03:48:27.653]  You should not want to live in a country where people can, without due process, have implications, be put on a secret list.
[03:48:27.773 --> 03:48:41.144]  Okay, we've got watch lists, we've got no-fly lists, now we're going to have maybe mentally ill lists, where you're put on this without your knowledge, without a day in court, you can't confront your accusers, you can't call witnesses in your defense,
[03:48:42.244 --> 03:48:45.325]  They just do this, and someday you'll find out about it.
[03:48:46.025 --> 03:48:48.906]  That is the pattern of behavior that is developing this.
[03:48:48.926 --> 03:48:52.627]  It is much bigger than just the single issue of guns.
[03:48:53.147 --> 03:49:11.233]  And that's why we need to talk to each other and understand that when we're talking, whether we're talking about guns over here that conservatives like, or we're talking, and then they hate drugs, or whether we're talking about drugs that the liberals are not afraid of, but they are really afraid of guns, we need to look at the bigger picture.
[03:49:12.321 --> 03:49:17.351]  We need to look at the context, the kind of country that we're creating, the kind of country that we are destroying.
[03:49:18.257 --> 03:49:19.758]  We're destroying the rule of law.
[03:49:20.318 --> 03:49:26.062]  We're destroying due process and protections that have been put in for a very good reason for hundreds of years.
[03:49:26.102 --> 03:49:27.803]  Things that are going back to the Magna Carta.
[03:49:27.823 --> 03:49:34.047]  We do not want to have a secret star chamber that is going to secretly evaluate us.
[03:49:34.467 --> 03:49:42.092]  We don't want to have a kind of Stasi society where everyone is encouraged and threatened to become snitches on each other.
[03:49:43.496 --> 03:49:55.767]  So let me go from drugs now, to the war on drugs, to those of you who are on the conservative side, who are not afraid of guns, but you're so afraid of drugs that you will give any kind of power to the government, okay?
[03:49:55.787 --> 03:49:58.029]  Let me read you a story here, because this is very interesting.
[03:49:58.509 --> 03:50:00.591]  This is a retired couple, they're white.
[03:50:01.432 --> 03:50:02.633]  And guess where they're retired from?
[03:50:03.093 --> 03:50:04.014]  The CIA!
[03:50:04.574 --> 03:50:05.936]  Now let me tell you what happened to them.
[03:50:06.857 --> 03:50:11.939]  They were making tea, they were discarding the leaves, and then they got swatted, okay?
[03:50:11.979 --> 03:50:16.500]  You had a highway patrolman who looked at, saw them coming out of a hydroponic store.
[03:50:16.540 --> 03:50:22.542]  And I can't believe, here we are, 25 years after I first started seeing these kinds of stories.
[03:50:22.562 --> 03:50:31.785]  I remember when I was with the Libertarian Party, there was story after story of cops hanging out at hydroponic stores, following people home, and then subjecting them to raids.
[03:50:32.025 --> 03:50:40.135]  Because you know if you go to a hydroponic store and you want to do aquaponics or you want to raise tomatoes in your home as these people wanted to do, that's suspicious.
[03:50:40.696 --> 03:50:43.599]  Maybe you're growing something that we don't think you should grow.
[03:50:43.619 --> 03:50:44.280]  Okay?
[03:50:44.340 --> 03:50:47.504]  So he puts them on a list and then they go through their garbage.
[03:50:47.785 --> 03:50:48.385]  What do they find?
[03:50:48.826 --> 03:50:49.407]  Tea leaves!
[03:50:49.927 --> 03:50:50.208]  Okay?
[03:50:50.488 --> 03:50:53.752]  So that gets a SWAT team to break into their homes.
[03:50:54.093 --> 03:50:54.613]  Violently.
[03:50:54.713 --> 03:50:55.494]  No-knock raid.
[03:50:55.534 --> 03:50:56.416]  They were furious.
[03:50:56.856 --> 03:50:59.700]  And the district judge says, they had probable cause.
[03:50:59.820 --> 03:51:00.921]  I have no problems with that.
[03:51:01.442 --> 03:51:02.864]  Now let me ask you, conservatives.
[03:51:03.224 --> 03:51:04.586]  Can you read the tea leaves?
[03:51:04.926 --> 03:51:06.288]  Can you see where this is headed?
[03:51:07.069 --> 03:51:11.992]  We need to come together, we need to understand how we're destroying the legal foundations of our privacy.
[03:51:12.012 --> 03:51:13.553]  My name is Don Whiskin.
[03:51:13.613 --> 03:51:17.656]  In 1994, I lost my 62-year-old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[03:51:18.376 --> 03:51:22.159]  In 1977, my 44-year-old brother was found dead in his apartment.
[03:51:22.379 --> 03:51:23.440]  He suffered a heart attack.
[03:51:23.920 --> 03:51:27.363]  In January of 98, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed.
[03:51:27.823 --> 03:51:32.286]  21 days later, my 53-year-old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital.
[03:51:32.587 --> 03:51:33.467]  He waited too long.
[03:51:33.868 --> 03:51:36.890]  In June, that same year, I almost joined them at 42.
[03:51:37.230 --> 03:51:37.871]  What did I do?
[03:51:38.111 --> 03:51:45.376]  I took a 7-herb formula I now call ExtendoVite made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginkgo biloba, hawthorn, milk thistle, and valerian.
[03:51:45.576 --> 03:51:47.758]  Based on German studies of natural medicine,
[03:51:47.938 --> 03:51:53.743]  ExtendoVite is designed to clear blocked arteries, clean the toxins from your blood, and improve your immune system.

[03:54:22.441 --> 03:54:23.601]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:23.641 --> 03:54:24.162]  I'm David Knight.
[03:54:24.202 --> 03:54:26.883]  In this last segment, there's a lot of things I'd like to cover.
[03:54:27.603 --> 03:54:32.465]  There's a situation that happened in Raleigh, where I'm from, with the TSA.
[03:54:32.525 --> 03:54:36.806]  We've got Harry Reid retiring and he wants his slush fund to retire with.
[03:54:37.746 --> 03:54:39.127]  A $600,000 slush fund.
[03:54:39.167 --> 03:54:46.209]  I want to take a look at where Harry Reid got all of his millions and why he should be a special case.
[03:54:46.329 --> 03:54:49.691]  Why he should be able to keep all of his money that's in his re-election campaign.
[03:54:51.151 --> 03:54:57.437]  But before we do, I just want to tell you real quickly, remind you that we've got 15% off across the board, everything at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:55:01.781 --> 03:55:16.335]  And as I pointed out earlier, you know, when you look at these stories about what happened with the EPA polluting a river that went through three states, polluted wells, where you look at the story about now an emergency situation in Michigan, in Flint, Michigan, with lead in the water there.
[03:55:16.975 --> 03:55:19.177]  You need to take care of your family.
[03:55:19.217 --> 03:55:22.120]  And of course, there's a lot of health products that we have at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:55:22.220 --> 03:55:24.722]  All of those 15% off, as well as water filters.
[03:55:25.062 --> 03:55:27.024]  We have the new InfoWars calendar, $6.95.
[03:55:27.424 --> 03:55:28.766]  Pays for itself.
[03:55:29.126 --> 03:55:31.788]  20% off each month at InfoWarsStore special promotions.
[03:55:32.649 --> 03:55:34.611]  Now I want to go first to this TSA story.
[03:55:35.515 --> 03:55:41.560]  This is something's breaking in local news in California and local news in North Carolina and Raleigh as well as RT has picked it up.
[03:55:41.620 --> 03:55:44.282]  Daily Mail had it at the top of their website.
[03:55:44.943 --> 03:55:46.484]  This is a situation in Raleigh.
[03:55:46.504 --> 03:55:50.988]  You had a father outraged and there's video of his daughter being patted down.
[03:55:51.068 --> 03:55:53.550]  It went for a very long time and what was her crime?
[03:55:54.131 --> 03:55:57.513]  She had a juice box in her carry-on bag.
[03:55:58.254 --> 03:55:58.834]  A terrorist.
[03:55:59.334 --> 03:56:00.175]  Obviously a terrorist.
[03:56:00.555 --> 03:56:04.336]  The juice exceeded the limit of three ounces of liquids for a carry-on.
[03:56:04.356 --> 03:56:06.997]  Now, he said that he thought this was excessive.
[03:56:07.057 --> 03:56:09.098]  He says, I'm a very big proponent of security.
[03:56:09.498 --> 03:56:10.979]  If they were patting me down, no problem.
[03:56:10.999 --> 03:56:12.099]  But this is a 10-year-old girl.
[03:56:12.119 --> 03:56:13.140]  Well, let me explain to you, Dad.
[03:56:14.650 --> 03:56:21.773]  When you allow them to do that to you, they will do it to your children and your grandchildren and your great-grandchildren.
[03:56:22.173 --> 03:56:24.414]  It's just like when you're on the airplane itself.
[03:56:24.514 --> 03:56:28.096]  Remember when they give you instructions about when that oxygen mask comes down?
[03:56:28.636 --> 03:56:35.899]  They tell you, put that on yourself first before you try to take care of your child, because then you'll be able to put it on your child and help others around you.
[03:56:36.139 --> 03:56:36.420]  Okay?
[03:56:36.980 --> 03:56:43.703]  If you don't respect yourself, if you don't stand up for your freedom, for your dignity, they'll take it from your family, too.
[03:56:44.707 --> 03:56:44.887]  That's
[03:57:04.497 --> 03:57:07.340]  We've shown all the different vulnerabilities and the idiocy with it.
[03:57:07.360 --> 03:57:18.952]  We've even shown you the unredacted publications from the TSA saying there is no threat to airports or airplanes, as they were saying, if you stop the pat-down of your children, as we had the reaction here in Texas.
[03:57:19.112 --> 03:57:24.097]  We had a local legislator put that in, and it passed unanimously in the House, so they said,
[03:57:25.165 --> 03:57:26.486]  You're not going to pass that in the Senate.
[03:57:26.566 --> 03:57:38.252]  They got our former CIA Lieutenant Governor Dewhurst to route that in the Senate and they had the TSA say we'll turn Texas into a no-fly zone if you stop us from patting down your children.
[03:57:39.158 --> 03:57:40.459]  They know exactly what this is about.
[03:57:40.479 --> 03:57:43.001]  This is nothing but obedience training.
[03:57:43.602 --> 03:57:44.443]  This is what B.F.
[03:57:44.463 --> 03:57:46.364]  Skinner called operant conditioning.
[03:57:47.145 --> 03:57:50.828]  Let me put my hand on you and I'll reward you with letting you travel on a plane.
[03:57:51.469 --> 03:57:53.391]  It's the same thing I do to my border collie.
[03:57:53.991 --> 03:57:55.533]  He gets upset when people come to the door.
[03:57:55.613 --> 03:58:00.757]  What we do is we say, okay, let's have somebody, we'll stage somebody coming to the door and when he starts
[03:58:01.778 --> 03:58:03.398]  Getting all excited, wants to bite them?
[03:58:03.438 --> 03:58:04.739]  What we'll do is we'll hand him some food.
[03:58:05.059 --> 03:58:05.999]  We'll keep handing him food.
[03:58:06.419 --> 03:58:09.500]  And pretty soon, we don't have to threaten him.
[03:58:10.160 --> 03:58:13.060]  He just likes the positive reinforcement.
[03:58:13.581 --> 03:58:14.681]  It's about security.
[03:58:15.041 --> 03:58:16.961]  It's about your ability to travel.
[03:58:17.261 --> 03:58:18.542]  This is for your own good.
[03:58:19.002 --> 03:58:20.042]  Be a good little doggie.
[03:58:20.402 --> 03:58:21.602]  Do what the government says.
[03:58:21.642 --> 03:58:25.783]  Join us tonight at InfoWars Nightly News, 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:25.823 --> 03:58:26.083]  Eastern.
[03:58:51.048 --> 03:58:52.321]  You are listening to GCP.
