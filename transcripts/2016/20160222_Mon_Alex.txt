[00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:09.704]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.704 --> 00:00:11.285]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.285 --> 00:00:12.846]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:17.029]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.091]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.127 --> 00:00:38.048]  Get ready, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:38.048 --> 00:00:44.372]  This is going to be another incredibly important Global Transmission, jam-packed with guests, analysis, you name it.
[00:00:44.372 --> 00:00:46.393]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:00:46.393 --> 00:00:51.536]  Paul Joseph Watson, Will Honcho, and quarterback the fourth hour today.
[00:00:51.536 --> 00:00:57.239]  We have a very special group of in-studio guests as well, I'll tell you about in the next segment.
[00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.121]  This is another information overload, but I must cover it all.
[00:01:01.365 --> 00:01:06.110]  The situation in the Middle East and North Africa has been destabilized by design.
[00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:20.786]  We predicted exactly what would now begin to unfold five years ago with the destabilization program that began in Libya and the staged Arab Spring run by MI6, the CIA, Mossad, and other major Western governments and NATO.
[00:01:21.974 --> 00:01:29.320]  Now the destabilization is intensifying, but not going exactly how they had wanted it to go.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:41.549]  And the Russians basically have moved tactical nuclear weapons, obviously, up to their borders and into Syria, and are basically telegraphing that they're prepared to use them.
[00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.532]  But that's only after the Saudis announced, OK, we have nukes.
[00:01:45.532 --> 00:01:49.094]  OK, we're going to send in a multi-hundred-thousand-person army into Syria.
[00:01:50.174 --> 00:01:53.097]  And you better not fight us, Assad, or we'll use nukes on you.
[00:01:53.097 --> 00:02:01.365]  So the whole situation is hurdling towards crisis, but this just broke, just broke 30 minutes ago.
[00:02:01.365 --> 00:02:06.609]  As I was shooting a live Facebook mentions warning of this, this is from Reuters.
[00:02:07.768 --> 00:02:23.572]  It's also in the Associated Press, and we will see if this holds, but U.S.-Russia, U.S.-Russia reach deal on ceasefire in Syria to begin February 27th, or in about five days.
[00:02:23.572 --> 00:02:25.232]  So we're going to be going over that.
[00:02:25.232 --> 00:02:31.254]  Also, now we're hearing that we have to reinvade Libya to kick out
[00:02:32.581 --> 00:02:45.571]  The Al-Qaeda that Hillary and Obama put in charge, and I said when they did it, I said watch, in a few years they'll be saying we have to re-invade to kick them out, but it won't be to actually kick them out, it'll be to fight anybody fighting them.
[00:02:45.571 --> 00:02:52.516]  And if you actually read closely, they're not bombing Benghazi, Al-Qaeda's home base in North Africa, really their global command base now, even more than Syria.
[00:02:53.557 --> 00:02:56.979]  And they're going to actually go after the opposition, which is what they're doing.
[00:02:56.979 --> 00:03:02.683]  So the attack on Al-Qaeda is actually to protect them.
[00:03:03.573 --> 00:03:08.057]  And it'll even come out like it has in Iraq and Syria if that's the case.
[00:03:08.057 --> 00:03:09.959]  It'll just be in the back of the newspaper.
[00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.184]  But this is how truly sickening the controllers are using the thong of war.
[00:03:15.184 --> 00:03:16.465]  That's coming up.
[00:03:16.465 --> 00:03:21.830]  Donald Trump has turbocharged to the lead with 60 plus delegates.
[00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.692]  His closest rival only has eight delegates.
[00:03:25.646 --> 00:03:27.127]  That's Ted Cruz.
[00:03:27.127 --> 00:03:34.131]  And Hillary, despite being down in polls, has now stolen Nevada as she stole New Hampshire and as she stole Iowa.
[00:03:34.131 --> 00:03:36.673]  And I mean, she stole the first two openly.
[00:03:37.882 --> 00:03:43.166]  And she lost by 20 points in New Hampshire, but got the delegates, most of the delegates.
[00:03:43.166 --> 00:03:45.868]  So that's how that works, and they're now in the New York Times.
[00:03:45.868 --> 00:03:46.909]  Why, they just broke it.
[00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:55.296]  The New York Times is so cutting edge, give them a Pulitzer right now, that the superdelegates don't matter.
[00:03:55.296 --> 00:04:00.500]  The election doesn't matter because the superdelegates will do what the party tells them, and they're all going for Hillary.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.822]  So Bernie could win a landslide, he's going to lose the nomination.
[00:04:03.822 --> 00:04:07.305]  My gosh, I just learned that from the New York Times this morning.
[00:04:08.585 --> 00:04:09.666]  We broke it down years ago.
[00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:10.626]  We broke it down this year.
[00:04:10.626 --> 00:04:11.687]  We predicted it would happen.
[00:04:11.687 --> 00:04:12.687]  It's now happening.
[00:04:12.687 --> 00:04:21.211]  And our own Richard Reeves will be popping in at 12 noon for about 15 minutes from Nevada ahead of the Republican caucus tomorrow.
[00:04:21.211 --> 00:04:27.253]  And then we also, of course, are going to be covering things right through Super Tuesday on March 1st.
[00:04:27.253 --> 00:04:29.634]  So we are in the field on that front.
[00:04:29.634 --> 00:04:33.396]  I've not even begun to scratch the surface of the New York Times again.
[00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.051]  Has a big announcement that the sun is yellow in color.
[00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:42.672]  Oh, no, it's even more stupid than that.
[00:04:42.672 --> 00:04:47.593]  Scientists ponder the prospect of contagious cancer.
[00:04:47.593 --> 00:04:48.513]  It's viral?
[00:04:48.513 --> 00:04:49.793]  Well, that's the main... What?
[00:04:49.793 --> 00:04:54.514]  Oh, and it's weaponized?
[00:04:54.514 --> 00:04:56.295]  Government made it?
[00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:56.735]  What?
[00:04:58.925 --> 00:05:01.226]  Jeb Bush is out of the presidential race.
[00:05:01.226 --> 00:05:12.249]  The former Florida governor has dropped out of the 2016 White House race after losing the South Carolina primary badly to billionaire Donald Trump, who secured a strong victory with nearly a third of the vote.
[00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:16.870]  Bush formally launched his campaign back in June, about six months after he announced he would run for top office.
[00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:24.016]  He was supported by the Right to Rise Political Action Committee, which had raised in excess $100 million for his campaign launch.
[00:05:24.016 --> 00:05:35.366]  But no amount of money could save Bush, a dorky candidate who at one point actually begged the audience to please clap for him after his speech, and was hilariously thrown off the stage at another speech for going over his allotted time.
[00:05:35.366 --> 00:05:40.090]  People are simply tired of establishment candidates who want amnesty for illegals flooding into the country.
[00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:50.965]  It also didn't help that Bush blew off the idea of releasing the missing 28 pages from the 9-11 report, which were classified not because of national security, but because they reveal Saudi Arabia's involvement in the attacks.
[00:05:50.965 --> 00:05:55.511]  For more election news, check out InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:56.773]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:03.949]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:11.674]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:06:11.674 --> 00:06:20.280]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:30.006]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:06:30.286 --> 00:06:34.527]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:37.948]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[00:06:37.948 --> 00:06:49.090]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.991]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[00:06:51.991 --> 00:06:57.972]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:00.394]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:07:00.394 --> 00:07:01.895]  You can't survive without it.
[00:07:01.895 --> 00:07:03.076]  But where do you get it?
[00:07:03.076 --> 00:07:09.081]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:14.806]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.

[00:07:34.734 --> 00:07:36.194]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:07:36.194 --> 00:07:37.234]  Easy assembly.
[00:07:37.234 --> 00:07:38.154]  Low maintenance.
[00:07:38.154 --> 00:07:40.255]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:07:59.246 --> 00:07:59.846]  We've got it.
[00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:06.368]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:08:06.368 --> 00:08:10.730]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:19.432]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:27.075]  The Joint Chiefs of Staff last year, this year as well, have come out, you can pull up their statements, and warned that the world is in the most dangerous
[00:08:28.923 --> 00:08:36.548]  geopolitical season that they've ever seen.
[00:08:36.548 --> 00:08:52.800]  The British Ministry of Defense in 2007, as well as the Pentagon, put out detailed reports that basically mirrored each other, predicting that the world would enter global crisis by 2016 into 2022 because of demographic cliffs and other major issues.
[00:08:54.073 --> 00:08:59.696]  You want to pull up those reports, just type in flash mobs, brain chips, a grim future.
[00:08:59.696 --> 00:09:11.423]  You'll get the London Guardian that leaks and links to the British Ministry of Defence report and then you can also in the same article find the US report.
[00:09:11.423 --> 00:09:17.147]  That's another reason when you tune in, you notice what we cover and warn about just keeps happening.
[00:09:17.147 --> 00:09:20.789]  The social engineers, the big think tanks know full well what's going on.
[00:09:22.298 --> 00:09:27.760]  They just don't normally put it in the newspaper.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:39.785]  But more and more, the establishment media doesn't want to be obsolete or passé, so they are admitting more and more of it.
[00:09:39.785 --> 00:09:45.068]  We had scientists on 16, 17 years ago that microwave radiation from cell phones
[00:09:46.616 --> 00:09:49.698]  Severs the tails, basically, off of sperm.
[00:09:49.698 --> 00:09:51.318]  It vibrates them off.
[00:09:51.318 --> 00:09:55.400]  It's like you take a snake and you sit there and shake it, you know, the tail will crack off.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.782]  Anybody's ever tried to catch a snake, notice a lot of times the tail snaps off for a lizard.
[00:09:58.782 --> 00:09:59.743]  Same deal with these cells.
[00:09:59.743 --> 00:10:06.006]  You just hit them with like an ultrasound, basically, is what radiation does, that wavelength, and it rattles them apart.
[00:10:06.006 --> 00:10:07.747]  That's been known forever.
[00:10:07.747 --> 00:10:10.308]  Oh, it's mainstream news today.
[00:10:10.308 --> 00:10:13.009]  Oh my gosh.
[00:10:13.009 --> 00:10:14.430]  Don't keep your cell phone in your pocket.
[00:10:15.486 --> 00:10:18.148]  You're like, well, I'm not using it when it's in my pocket.
[00:10:18.148 --> 00:10:20.450]  It's sending messages back and forth.
[00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.532]  It's on all the time, folks.
[00:10:23.532 --> 00:10:31.699]  Oh, the New York Times admits scientists ponder the prospect of contagious cancer.
[00:10:31.699 --> 00:10:40.385]  They've known that cancer was transmissible for over 100 years in rat studies.
[00:10:40.385 --> 00:10:40.826]  Before 1900.
[00:10:40.826 --> 00:10:43.668]  I mean, I've made films on this subject.
[00:10:44.969 --> 00:10:53.892]  They know that over 100 million Americans got cancer from SV40 in the first 20 years plus of the polio vaccine.
[00:10:53.892 --> 00:11:13.197]  You can just type into a search engine, CDC documents on SV40 and cancer, and you'll get stuff released in the 70s from the 60s where they predict that 98 million was the number they used from their actuaries got cancers.
[00:11:14.116 --> 00:11:16.877]  That were non-existent or rare.
[00:11:16.877 --> 00:11:19.717]  That's why there's all these hundreds of new cancers.
[00:11:19.717 --> 00:11:21.598]  And then here's the big one.
[00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:30.340]  Every major vaccine you look at that deals with virus or attenuated just so happens magically to have all these other weird viruses in it and it's not an accident.
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:33.000]  It's the Rockefeller Foundation operation.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.341]  I've had top brain surgeons and others on who've read the medical literature.
[00:11:36.341 --> 00:11:39.262]  I've read it too, but I mean Russell Blaylock and others.
[00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:47.311]  Coming on to talk about the fact that it was a deliberate program.
[00:11:47.311 --> 00:11:52.773]  Of course, folks, things were even more toxic in our environment in the 20s and 30s.
[00:11:52.773 --> 00:12:00.335]  I mean, they used to dump toxic waste, mercury, lead, arsenic, stuff worse than that, right in the rivers.
[00:12:00.335 --> 00:12:03.355]  And we didn't have cancer rates like this.
[00:12:03.355 --> 00:12:07.577]  People ate bigger calorie meals than we do now.
[00:12:07.577 --> 00:12:08.637]  Why are we dying more?
[00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:28.453]  I've got all this world news to cover it's just that just on the medical end of things it's known and I've had the survivors and the nurses and people on in famous cases where people got killed
[00:12:29.485 --> 00:12:33.946]  To cover up what was going on in weaponized cancer research in the early 60s.
[00:12:33.946 --> 00:12:45.329]  And of course it's been declassified there was a plan to basically put cancer viruses into a sauce that would be put on Fidel Castro's food.
[00:12:45.329 --> 00:12:53.712]  So, this is personal for me and it's personal for everybody else because chances are your grandparents you lost, your mom, your dad, you name it.
[00:12:54.568 --> 00:12:56.869]  You wonder why the military has such high rates of cancer?
[00:12:56.869 --> 00:13:00.692]  There's a lot of reasons, but the biggest one is the vaccines.
[00:13:00.692 --> 00:13:05.295]  And the fact that the New York Times would come out with an article going, you know what?
[00:13:05.295 --> 00:13:15.481]  Scientists ponder the prospect of contagious cancer from vaccines.
[00:13:15.481 --> 00:13:21.945]  Ladies and gentlemen, cancer is part of the immortal cell line.
[00:13:21.945 --> 00:13:23.406]  And if you don't know what that is, it's
[00:13:25.199 --> 00:13:28.802]  They call it the immortal cell line in medical literature.
[00:13:28.802 --> 00:13:34.047]  It's one of the most highly studied things and one of the most secret things.
[00:13:34.047 --> 00:13:39.711]  But the cells actually are basically zombies.
[00:13:39.711 --> 00:13:43.595]  They're undead.
[00:13:43.595 --> 00:13:46.097]  Basically, vampire cell lines.
[00:13:46.097 --> 00:13:48.819]  And I don't mean vampires like Count Dracula.
[00:13:48.819 --> 00:13:50.901]  I mean, look it up.
[00:13:50.901 --> 00:13:51.742]  Immortal cell lines.
[00:13:53.134 --> 00:14:07.247]  There are some cancer cells that do not die unless you burn them.
[00:14:07.247 --> 00:14:16.535]  That's how powerful they are, and the elite are obsessed with it, because if you can figure out how to get that in the rest of the body, but not have it mutate, then you basically live forever.
[00:14:19.926 --> 00:14:28.056]  This is a big deal, and it's what the globalists are obsessed with, and this is just more of these realms we expose here, but look at this article.
[00:14:28.056 --> 00:14:31.420]  Scientists ponder the prospect of contagious cancer.
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:35.165]  Oh my goodness!
[00:14:35.165 --> 00:14:38.629]  That's why elites pay to have fresh surgical...
[00:14:39.787 --> 00:14:40.408]  We're good to go.
[00:15:05.899 --> 00:15:07.140]  You can look this up.
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.501]  There's also things that aren't even really cancer cells.
[00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:11.282]  They're more like crystals.
[00:15:11.282 --> 00:15:17.145]  But they have a cellular replication system similar to biological cells.
[00:15:17.145 --> 00:15:19.726]  Call it nature's nanotech.
[00:15:19.726 --> 00:15:22.067]  Prions is one name of them.
[00:15:24.329 --> 00:15:27.970]  Spongiform encephalopathy and all that stuff's probably coming from it.
[00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.010]  Point is, this is the stuff going on out there.
[00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.291]  We're back in 1900 medicine.
[00:15:32.291 --> 00:15:41.792]  Bacteria and viruses and all this, and there's stuff way more complex than that, both organic and that's been artificially created.
[00:15:41.792 --> 00:15:44.293]  So, science is part of the prospect of contagious cancer.
[00:15:44.293 --> 00:15:48.674]  For all its peculiar horror, cancer comes with a saving grace.
[00:15:48.674 --> 00:15:49.274]  If nothing else,
[00:15:50.148 --> 00:15:51.789]  Can stop a tumor's mad evolution.
[00:15:51.789 --> 00:15:54.392]  The cancer ultimately dies along with its host.
[00:15:54.392 --> 00:16:01.778]  Everything the malignant cells have learned about outwitting the patient's defenses and those of the oncologist is erased.
[00:16:01.778 --> 00:16:03.800]  The next case of cancer is another victim.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.622]  Must start anew.
[00:16:06.622 --> 00:16:11.907]  It talks about recent papers about contagious cells and viruses.
[00:16:15.691 --> 00:16:23.339]  This is like the New York Times coming out and saying, there may have been two brothers in Kitty Hawk out on the plains.
[00:16:23.339 --> 00:16:36.252]  Get this, they may have actually invented and documented, get ready for it, powered flight in 2016.
[00:16:36.252 --> 00:16:38.694]  Give the New York Times a Pulitzer Prize, folks.
[00:16:38.694 --> 00:16:39.455]  Did you know that?
[00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:45.624]  Did you know that most cancer is viral?
[00:16:45.624 --> 00:16:47.125]  Oh my gosh!
[00:16:47.125 --> 00:16:48.285]  Did you know it's declassified?
[00:16:48.285 --> 00:16:49.726]  They put it in the vaccines to kill us?
[00:16:49.726 --> 00:16:50.507]  You little worm!
[00:16:50.507 --> 00:16:57.931]  I mean, how do these worms write these articles to condition us and get us to accept the next phase when their own families will be killed?
[00:16:58.891 --> 00:17:00.171]  I don't care.
[00:17:00.171 --> 00:17:03.472]  It's too much fun to walk into the New York Times and go, uh, yeah, uh.
[00:17:03.472 --> 00:17:13.854]  Because the minute they try to write an article about what's really going on, they'll be out on their butts and won't be able to drink coffee at Starbucks with their New York Times name tag and go, uh, uh, uh, uh.
[00:17:13.854 --> 00:17:15.934]  I mean, people are enemies of humanity.
[00:17:15.934 --> 00:17:17.455]  I don't know about this particular person.
[00:17:17.455 --> 00:17:18.735]  They may be an idiot.
[00:17:18.735 --> 00:17:21.975]  George Johnson.
[00:17:21.975 --> 00:17:24.296]  And by the way, people think I'm being mean to George Johnson.
[00:17:30.569 --> 00:17:35.750]  If you don't know, and you're writing articles about this, you're the biggest idiot, and I read your article.
[00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.651]  You clearly are not an idiot, so there you go.
[00:17:37.651 --> 00:17:40.772]  This is a revelation of the method.
[00:17:40.772 --> 00:17:49.134]  It's like telling somebody that's been locked up in a basement for 20 years that there's, you know, that again, I'm going to discover the sun for you.
[00:17:49.134 --> 00:17:56.696]  The way they talk to their, and people that read the New York Times think they're like really smart, like it's channeling the mind of God.
[00:17:56.696 --> 00:17:57.896]  I've talked to people, I've seen people
[00:17:58.803 --> 00:18:01.346]  Have you seen me reading the New York Times before in a cafe?
[00:18:01.346 --> 00:18:03.308]  Or someone seen it in my car?
[00:18:03.308 --> 00:18:06.452]  And I have reporters go, oh, you read the New York Times when a reporter's with me?
[00:18:06.452 --> 00:18:08.354]  And I go, oh, yes.
[00:18:08.354 --> 00:18:13.080]  And they're like, but I thought you don't like them.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.404]  What does that mean?
[00:18:16.404 --> 00:18:17.005]  I read everything.
[00:18:19.138 --> 00:18:23.759]  But it's like, oh my gosh, you, you, you.
[00:18:23.759 --> 00:18:26.799]  Imagine sitting around at cafes in public and just reading it.
[00:18:26.799 --> 00:18:30.000]  Oh, oh, I learned about cancer viruses today.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.480]  Oh, I'm so smart.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:36.381]  We're going to go to break and I'm going to come back with the huge nuke news, the huge economic news, the Zika news, all of it.
[00:18:36.381 --> 00:18:39.521]  But this is what it comes down to.
[00:18:39.521 --> 00:18:48.183]  They are really rolling out a lot of stuff to the sheep right now because they're getting ready to go operational with weaponized cancer that'll eat the paint off your house and suck the chrome off a trailer hitch.
[00:18:49.201 --> 00:18:52.786]  Now, before we go, because it's really nanotech cancer.
[00:18:52.786 --> 00:18:55.049]  Hope everybody enjoys it.
[00:18:55.049 --> 00:18:58.994]  They're going to get all your money out of your bank account before they plant you six foot under.
[00:18:58.994 --> 00:19:00.076]  And so many people are going to be dead.
[00:19:00.076 --> 00:19:03.240]  They're passing laws all over the world that don't let you get buried anymore, or even burned.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.844]  They're going to make you get put in acid, turn into fertilizer for the earth.
[00:19:07.825 --> 00:19:09.366]  Anyways, we're going to go to break.
[00:19:09.366 --> 00:19:17.568]  If you want to keep track of everything we cover here, I suggest you sign up for our free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.

[00:19:27.831 --> 00:19:35.217]  Contact with you because the more and more they're trying to censor us, especially if you're in the military, they're trying to keep you from being able to access us on base.

[00:19:45.246 --> 00:19:48.728]  I'm Alex Jones, and I'm dedicated to humanity.
[00:19:48.728 --> 00:19:52.031]  I'm a maniac, I'm a wild man, and I'm not backing down.

[00:19:55.034 --> 00:19:56.515]  Join us in the fight for humanity.
[00:20:00.186 --> 00:20:03.889]  I'm just a sweet old lady who needs help crossing the street.
[00:20:03.889 --> 00:20:09.333]  But the real reason I want to get to the other side is so I can steal your identity along the way.
[00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:16.058]  While you're holding onto my hand, the RFID reader in my purse is capturing all your personal information.
[00:20:16.058 --> 00:20:20.301]  Debit cards, credit cards, even your work ID badge isn't safe.
[00:20:20.301 --> 00:20:23.063]  Oh, you have an RFID chipped subway pass?
[00:20:23.063 --> 00:20:24.464]  Well now, so do I!
[00:20:25.925 --> 00:20:30.808]  Protect yourself from crimes you can't see with ID Stronghold wallets, card sleeves, and purses.

[00:20:36.632 --> 00:20:39.494]  Even when your wallet is open, imitators don't do that.
[00:20:39.494 --> 00:20:44.377]  ID Stronghold wallets even cost about the same as wallets in most stores, but give you extra protection.
[00:20:44.377 --> 00:20:48.720]  Visit IDStronghold.com and get the original RFID blocking wallet.

[00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:31.508]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[00:22:31.508 --> 00:22:34.130]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:34.890]  Croix River.
[00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:37.111]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[00:22:37.111 --> 00:22:40.072]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:22:40.072 --> 00:22:40.952]  His excuse?
[00:22:40.952 --> 00:22:42.293]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:22:42.293 --> 00:22:43.894]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[00:22:43.894 --> 00:22:49.656]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[00:24:06.676 --> 00:24:07.636]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[00:24:07.636 --> 00:24:10.237]  The Clinton Foundation's got them posted.
[00:24:10.237 --> 00:24:15.918]  From the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:24:15.918 --> 00:24:22.560]  That's right, the Clintons have gotten close to $4 billion.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.601]  The old maps show $3 billion.
[00:24:24.601 --> 00:24:28.202]  And she's set to get a billion in this election.
[00:24:28.202 --> 00:24:30.822]  Isn't that just sweet?
[00:24:35.803 --> 00:24:38.246]  Oh, she's criticizing Big Pharma.
[00:24:38.246 --> 00:24:41.870]  She gets more Big Pharma money than everybody combined.
[00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:44.993]  I saw that article over the weekend.
[00:24:44.993 --> 00:24:50.439]  She's for integrity in elections, but she has her superdelegates steal them all from Bernie Sanders.
[00:24:50.439 --> 00:24:51.941]  That's okay, because...
[00:24:55.365 --> 00:25:00.086]  She's not gonna be a billion dollar, or a trillion dollar, but a zillion dollar baby.
[00:25:00.086 --> 00:25:07.807]  If she becomes El Presidente and her husband can cheat death, looks like a zombie, and become the head of the UN.
[00:25:07.807 --> 00:25:13.449]  Now that's a zillion dollar baby right there.
[00:25:13.449 --> 00:25:19.830]  Listen to that guitar from Alice Cooper, the patriot.
[00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:20.770]  Billion dollar baby.
[00:25:24.824 --> 00:25:27.869]  You know, Alice Cooper's the guy, reportedly, that led Dave Mustaine to Christ.
[00:25:27.869 --> 00:25:33.857]  Pretty interesting stuff.
[00:25:33.857 --> 00:25:37.082]  Trillion dollar baby!
[00:25:37.082 --> 00:25:38.644]  Alright, we are back live.
[00:25:38.644 --> 00:25:40.787]  Let me just do this in a short segment.
[00:25:43.138 --> 00:25:47.039]  Because I want to try to get focused here in the next segment and really burrow down into this.
[00:25:47.039 --> 00:25:52.681]  And I'm sitting here not knowing actually what is the most important smorgasbord to get into.
[00:25:52.681 --> 00:25:59.303]  Because there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 stacks.
[00:25:59.303 --> 00:26:02.884]  And then 14, there's a stack down here in my guest section.
[00:26:02.884 --> 00:26:08.966]  I have 14 stacks and a magazine and a bunch of clips.
[00:26:08.966 --> 00:26:10.407]  And I guess this is the most important thing.
[00:26:11.357 --> 00:26:15.580]  It is that they're telling you that, oh guess what, cancer viruses are killing you.
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:20.904]  Next they're gonna go, wow, did you know cancer in children's up over 10,000% what it was 50 years ago?
[00:26:20.904 --> 00:26:23.046]  Oh, breast cancer's up a couple thousand percentage.
[00:26:23.046 --> 00:26:25.468]  Type 1 diabetes is up a couple thousand percentage.
[00:26:25.468 --> 00:26:27.169]  They say it's genetic, but everybody's getting it.
[00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:28.691]  Oh, type 2's exploding.
[00:26:28.691 --> 00:26:31.253]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
[00:26:31.253 --> 00:26:35.936]  I've got 200 plus articles today.
[00:26:35.936 --> 00:26:37.597]  And that's the most important one right there.
[00:26:37.597 --> 00:26:39.299]  And you know what's next most important?
[00:26:40.728 --> 00:26:44.250]  This little juicy right here.
[00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.331]  Let's punch up DrudgeReport.com.
[00:26:47.331 --> 00:26:48.372]  Look at that headline.
[00:26:48.372 --> 00:26:53.074]  And I tell you, I rarely see an image that says so much.
[00:26:53.074 --> 00:26:55.535]  Rise of the Facebook Zombies.
[00:26:55.535 --> 00:26:59.417]  And if we can, let's go to the actual page and show folks an HD shot of that photo.
[00:26:59.417 --> 00:27:07.461]  Because Zuckerberg, I went on Facebook Mentions on his platform today and talked to about 100,000 people live.
[00:27:07.461 --> 00:27:08.622]  It'll be a million by tomorrow.
[00:27:10.319 --> 00:27:13.821]  It's a billion all across the world in the aggregate every year that tune in.
[00:27:13.821 --> 00:27:15.922]  I guess that is a billion-dollar baby right there.
[00:27:15.922 --> 00:27:21.705]  Rise of the Facebook Zombos.
[00:27:21.705 --> 00:27:24.707]  And boy, does that photo say it all right there.
[00:27:24.707 --> 00:27:29.929]  If you're a radio listener, it's a room of about a thousand people.
[00:27:29.929 --> 00:27:34.552]  And Zuckerberg, the guy that says his users are dumb effers for trusting him,
[00:27:36.843 --> 00:27:54.659]  And it's all these Facebook minions ordered to basically put these virtual reality goggles on, and everyone has the goggles on, everyone is wired up to their head, everyone's being fed the reality that the wizard wants them to have.
[00:27:55.566 --> 00:28:09.590]  And the wizard is little Zuki Berg, who goes to Bilderberg Group and goes to Davos and has that ravenous wolf look in his eyes, like the other little snot-nose that raised the price of the drug 5,000-something percent.
[00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:17.112]  They have that same just... They're just empowered with the demonic energy to dominate.
[00:28:17.112 --> 00:28:20.273]  I just can't believe how sheep-like the public are.
[00:28:20.273 --> 00:28:24.654]  It's not the technology's bad, it's that it's Trojan-horsed to end humanity's freedom.
[00:28:27.263 --> 00:28:29.504]  They want to dominate you completely.
[00:28:29.504 --> 00:28:38.388]  They have that shame beyond narcissistic, but psychotic narcissistic aura to them.
[00:28:38.388 --> 00:28:40.068]  And they just walk into a room.
[00:28:40.068 --> 00:28:46.611]  I was invited to a party about five years ago by a rock star that had a bunch of these people in it.
[00:28:46.611 --> 00:28:54.054]  And he said, but you're not allowed to talk about what you saw or the specific group or names.
[00:28:54.054 --> 00:28:54.194]  And
[00:28:56.283 --> 00:29:01.767]  It was a whole floor of the W they had, and I was only in there about an hour, and I said, I said, I'm out of here.
[00:29:01.767 --> 00:29:06.050]  And I was told, okay, but you just don't say anything.
[00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:08.432]  And man, they were crazed.
[00:29:08.432 --> 00:29:13.576]  And I'm telling you, these people were on something I've never heard of too, by the way.
[00:29:13.576 --> 00:29:16.358]  I didn't see them taking drugs or any of this, but boy, they were on something.
[00:29:16.358 --> 00:29:24.584]  And a couple of them, household names, saw me, flipped out, walked by me laughing at me, and left.
[00:29:26.684 --> 00:29:28.365]  But I digress.
[00:29:28.365 --> 00:29:32.567]  What is the secret of that photo when I come back?
[00:29:32.567 --> 00:29:35.328]  Why does it tell you everything?
[00:29:35.328 --> 00:29:47.253]  When we return, I'm going to go over the photo in detail, and then into all the other huge military news, economic news, election news, Trump storming another victory, Hillary stealing it from Bernie, the snot-nosed.
[00:29:47.253 --> 00:29:47.694]  We'll be back.
[00:29:47.694 --> 00:29:48.174]  Stay with us.
[00:29:48.174 --> 00:29:49.554]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.554 --> 00:29:52.076]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.076 --> 00:29:54.777]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.837 --> 00:30:05.165]  Putin has reportedly threatened to launch tactical nukes at Turkey if the ISIS-supporting country invades Syria with Saudi Arabia.
[00:30:05.165 --> 00:30:09.590]  The Russians have about 20,000 troops in Syria helping the Syrian government fight ISIS.
[00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:15.898]  And Putin warned the Turkish president that Moscow is prepared to use tactical nuclear weapons to protect its troops if Turkey attacks.
[00:30:16.378 --> 00:30:26.604]  Since Turkey is part of NATO, any such conflict could quickly escalate into a full-scale nuclear confrontation, said award-winning Iran-Contra journalist Robert Perry, who was tipped off about the warning.
[00:30:26.604 --> 00:30:35.188]  Moscow's apparent threat to repel a Turkish invasion of Syria with nukes follows a warning by the Russian Prime Minister that another world war will erupt if the U.S.
[00:30:35.188 --> 00:30:37.610]  and its allies send ground troops into Syria.
[00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:43.913]  And if Syria falls, Russia will be geopolitically isolated from the rest of the world, which is exactly what the globalists want.
[00:30:44.233 --> 00:30:46.978]  So they can easily hijack and control the country.
[00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:55.972]  And further adding to the threat of world war, Saudi Arabia is currently staging the biggest war game the region has seen in 25 years, according to Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:30:55.972 --> 00:30:57.254]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:04.487]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:31:04.487 --> 00:31:18.924]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:31:19.184 --> 00:31:27.191]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:31:27.191 --> 00:31:32.616]  And when you visit Infowarslife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:31:32.616 --> 00:31:36.319]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:31:36.319 --> 00:31:40.463]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:31:40.463 --> 00:31:44.327]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:31:44.807 --> 00:31:45.047]  I think so.
[00:32:03.809 --> 00:32:12.651]  Yongevity integrates years of scientific research into creating fantastic products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, plant-derived minerals, and much more.

[00:33:10.052 --> 00:33:16.308]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.802 --> 00:33:43.125]  So if you go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or go to our Twitter, RealAlexJones, you can find the article and the photo.
[00:33:43.125 --> 00:33:44.025]  Drudge has taken it down.
[00:33:44.025 --> 00:33:45.866]  It's not his top story, but he's still got it up.
[00:33:45.866 --> 00:33:49.707]  Rise of the Facebook Zombies is a good way to put it.
[00:33:49.707 --> 00:33:51.247]  And The Verge has the article.
[00:33:51.247 --> 00:33:52.588]  I've got it up on screen.
[00:33:52.588 --> 00:33:56.589]  This image of Mark Zuckerberg says so much about our future.
[00:34:00.495 --> 00:34:02.216]  And what does it say about our future?
[00:34:02.216 --> 00:34:11.359]  Well, you've got a room of a thousand plus people all hooked up, all being fed a Facebook virtual reality.
[00:34:11.359 --> 00:34:19.803]  And they're all contained in their little prisms that are about seven inches by three inches, these goggles.
[00:34:19.803 --> 00:34:29.867]  And there's Zuckerberg, like a technician at the University of Texas Primate Research Laboratory, outside Austin,
[00:34:31.527 --> 00:34:40.296]  Where the monkeys have the goggles hooked on their heads, testing flicker rates to put them in the different emotional responses.
[00:34:40.296 --> 00:34:43.619]  They can even make them have convulsions, they can even kill them.
[00:34:43.619 --> 00:34:46.923]  Told you about that about 16 years ago.
[00:34:46.923 --> 00:34:48.144]  And that research is now public.
[00:34:50.111 --> 00:34:53.854]  But how do you get these primates to hook the goggles on?
[00:34:53.854 --> 00:34:54.614]  You make it cool.
[00:34:54.614 --> 00:34:55.835]  You make it stylish.
[00:34:55.835 --> 00:34:57.176]  It's on a big stage.
[00:34:57.176 --> 00:34:58.737]  You get to meet Zuckerberg.
[00:34:58.737 --> 00:35:08.404]  You get to be part of it and show all the other people watching TV or listening or reading about it that, look, it's safe to go to the waterhole and drink.
[00:35:08.404 --> 00:35:12.627]  There's no 20-foot crocodile gonna shoot out and grab you and drag you into the muck.
[00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:17.611]  To our programming, our instincts, it must be safe.
[00:35:17.611 --> 00:35:18.271]  It's fun.
[00:35:18.271 --> 00:35:19.552]  There's no predators here.
[00:35:19.552 --> 00:35:21.432]  There's no big lions or tigers.
[00:35:21.432 --> 00:35:24.033]  There's no big crocodiles.
[00:35:24.033 --> 00:35:26.474]  There's nothing gonna eat ya.
[00:35:26.474 --> 00:35:28.054]  Cause look, Zuckerberg doesn't look scary.
[00:35:28.054 --> 00:35:29.315]  He's got a gray t-shirt on.
[00:35:30.762 --> 00:35:32.283]  Little white tennis shoes.
[00:35:32.283 --> 00:35:33.224]  He's smiling.
[00:35:33.224 --> 00:35:35.205]  Look at the little smile.
[00:35:35.205 --> 00:35:36.245]  It's a little smile.
[00:35:36.245 --> 00:35:39.127]  He calls his users that trust him, dumb effers.
[00:35:39.127 --> 00:35:41.649]  And he's walking by the dumb effers right there.
[00:35:41.649 --> 00:35:43.910]  And they've all got that goggles hooked on.
[00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:45.171]  But notice he doesn't.
[00:35:45.171 --> 00:35:47.192]  He's upright.
[00:35:47.192 --> 00:35:51.655]  He's bipedal.
[00:35:51.655 --> 00:35:53.756]  He doesn't have a earpiece in.
[00:35:53.756 --> 00:35:55.057]  He doesn't have a phone in his hand.
[00:35:55.057 --> 00:35:58.339]  He doesn't have a phone in his front pocket.
[00:35:58.339 --> 00:36:00.180]  He's strutting by his prisoners.
[00:36:05.265 --> 00:36:06.832]  But you notice he is a military man.
[00:36:06.832 --> 00:36:08.579]  He always wears that gray t-shirt.
[00:36:11.049 --> 00:36:17.793]  Because the bling and all that matter to him, the bling is nothing but bait on the end of a hook to lure you in.
[00:36:17.793 --> 00:36:21.575]  People say, oh, well I'll add a lot of virtual reality and I think it's great.
[00:36:21.575 --> 00:36:27.298]  Yeah, but the way they're designing it and rolling it out is designed to put you into a proto-matrix.
[00:36:27.298 --> 00:36:39.385]  The beginnings of the wirehead culture that the Pentagon and others admit they believe is what the elite have chosen to be our evolution.
[00:36:39.385 --> 00:36:40.106]  Where you then
[00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:49.557]  are self-contained and even provide power with your body's heat to run the system.
[00:36:49.557 --> 00:36:53.620]  Isn't that just special?
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:37:04.890]  In my book, Sentence to Tyranny, out of print, but it's on PrisonPlanet.tv, it's online for free too, I show some of the declassified army documents from 77 that the Federation of Scientists put out.
[00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:08.193]  The Pentagon asked it to be reclassified, actually, after we publicized it.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:18.845]  And it talked about what they called Skynet and how they would use GPS to control everything and to have remote control cars and track everything we do through the internet.
[00:37:18.845 --> 00:37:20.746]  This is in 77.
[00:37:20.746 --> 00:37:34.194]  And how we would all hook into the internet as a hive mind, use the word hive, and then finally end up living in pods, self-contained pods that we would choose to live in virtual reality.
[00:37:41.179 --> 00:37:45.881]  Isn't that just darling?
[00:37:45.881 --> 00:37:50.922]  And you're like, wow, Matrix came out in 99.
[00:37:50.922 --> 00:37:52.783]  Terminator came out in the 80s.
[00:37:52.783 --> 00:37:53.623]  Skynet.
[00:37:53.623 --> 00:37:54.864]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:54.864 --> 00:37:59.465]  They just take what they're really doing and then fictionalize it, just like X-Files.
[00:37:59.465 --> 00:38:03.807]  Just like, you know, I can't wait because Chris Carter says he's game to meet.
[00:38:03.807 --> 00:38:06.148]  I haven't even asked him to do an interview yet, but I'm sure he'll do it.
[00:38:06.148 --> 00:38:07.368]  And I know that
[00:38:08.908 --> 00:38:13.011]  One of his big actors, you know, came to the house one time.
[00:38:13.011 --> 00:38:13.612]  He was in town.
[00:38:13.612 --> 00:38:15.453]  He called a producer on the news and said, can I come over?
[00:38:15.453 --> 00:38:16.534]  And here he was.
[00:38:16.534 --> 00:38:17.815]  And he wasn't there really to interview me.
[00:38:17.815 --> 00:38:25.561]  He was there to say, you know, the CIA planted that lone gunman episode where they fly the jumbo jet in the World Trade Center to bring in martial law.
[00:38:25.561 --> 00:38:27.523]  They use a drill to cover it up.
[00:38:27.523 --> 00:38:30.946]  And they want to blame countries that didn't do it.
[00:38:30.946 --> 00:38:33.107]  But really, it's a rogue group in the government that carried out 9-11.
[00:38:34.718 --> 00:38:43.203]  And he said all he knows is that Chris Carter said that story was planted on him by the CIA, but that he was basically too scared to talk about it.
[00:38:43.203 --> 00:38:46.205]  And we reached out to Carter, and I don't know if that story is exactly accurate.
[00:38:46.205 --> 00:38:52.448]  That's in the midst of time, you know, like nine, ten years ago, that Dean Hagelin came to my house.
[00:38:52.448 --> 00:38:53.409]  You know, the interview's there.
[00:38:53.409 --> 00:38:56.511]  He said less in the interview, but said a lot of it.
[00:38:56.511 --> 00:39:02.214]  But I'm going to get to go out to California and meet with Carter.
[00:39:02.214 --> 00:39:03.975]  I look forward to doing that.
[00:39:05.461 --> 00:39:11.506]  Not because, oh, he's one of the biggest TV producers out there, or, oh, not because, you know, they might want me to do a cameo or something on the X-Files.
[00:39:11.506 --> 00:39:12.327]  I mean, I've been in movies.
[00:39:12.327 --> 00:39:13.148]  I've been on TV.
[00:39:13.148 --> 00:39:13.568]  I've been there.
[00:39:13.568 --> 00:39:14.789]  I've done it.
[00:39:14.789 --> 00:39:19.574]  It's interesting, but it's not that big a deal.
[00:39:19.574 --> 00:39:21.115]  The big deal is I want to ask him about that.
[00:39:21.115 --> 00:39:25.799]  And, of course, they might call him.
[00:39:25.799 --> 00:39:27.681]  I'm threatening now.
[00:39:27.681 --> 00:39:29.983]  But he doesn't have to answer if he doesn't want to.
[00:39:29.983 --> 00:39:32.285]  It's just this is how close we're getting to it, folks.
[00:39:34.514 --> 00:39:37.095]  I mean, you want to know if 9-11 was an inside job?
[00:39:37.095 --> 00:40:01.484]  There was an hour-long hit TV program, X-Files spinoff, Lone Gunman, where a criminal element of the government hijacks a jet by remote control, claims hijackers are on board, but really it's remote controlled, locked down, and they're going to fly it in the World Trade Center and blame Afghanistan.
[00:40:01.484 --> 00:40:02.024]  Think about that.
[00:40:05.947 --> 00:40:10.715]  In fact, we ought to put a piece together with just my talk about this today and then with the original clips.
[00:40:10.715 --> 00:40:14.782]  We actually bought the DVD set to have it in HD back there.
[00:40:14.782 --> 00:40:19.009]  But see, now I'm that close to unraveling that riddle.
[00:40:21.496 --> 00:40:24.758]  What are other stories Chris Carter has?
[00:40:24.758 --> 00:40:25.898]  And he said, just come on out.
[00:40:25.898 --> 00:40:28.720]  I've just been quite frankly too busy to get out there, but I am going to get out there.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:29.940]  I want to kill two birds with one stone.
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:35.323]  I still need to call Joe Rogan and get on his podcast, a few other things, a few other bucket list things when I go out there.
[00:40:35.323 --> 00:40:38.145]  But Joe keeps saying, come out, come out, come on the show.
[00:40:38.145 --> 00:40:40.066]  So I'm going to finally get that done after all these years.
[00:40:41.343 --> 00:40:41.903]  But I digress.
[00:40:41.903 --> 00:40:43.624]  I want to get into all the big news now.
[00:40:43.624 --> 00:40:46.344]  But Zuckerberg in the photo, he's walking upright.
[00:40:46.344 --> 00:40:47.485]  He's a man.
[00:40:47.485 --> 00:40:49.465]  He's not encumbered by all this tech.
[00:40:49.465 --> 00:40:53.967]  He's like Steve Jobs that said, I never let my kids be on any type of computer or iPhone or iPad.
[00:40:53.967 --> 00:40:55.047]  It reprograms the brain.
[00:40:55.047 --> 00:40:55.787]  It lowers IQ.
[00:40:55.787 --> 00:41:00.109]  It sucks you into a false reality.
[00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:05.250]  See, for me, I use an iPad like a TV set or a newspaper.
[00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:06.791]  I watch stuff on it.
[00:41:06.791 --> 00:41:07.751]  I read things on it.
[00:41:09.502 --> 00:41:13.685]  I use it as a tool and then I put programming on it to counter the globalist.
[00:41:13.685 --> 00:41:17.207]  I like to always say, I don't watch a lot of TV, I'm on TV.
[00:41:17.207 --> 00:41:22.430]  The last few years I've been on five different shows and series.
[00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:23.771]  A couple of them I basically host.
[00:41:23.771 --> 00:41:29.114]  They didn't say I was the host, but they interviewed me for six hours and I'm the main guy on all of them.
[00:41:29.114 --> 00:41:30.675]  And I've not watched one of the shows.
[00:41:32.639 --> 00:41:41.264]  I'll be in a hotel room or something, my kids will be, I'll let them watch TV like twice a week, be scrolling through, History Channel, Discovery, they'll go, Daddy, Daddy, your TV show.
[00:41:41.264 --> 00:41:43.685]  I'm like, we're not watching that.
[00:41:43.685 --> 00:41:45.426]  And the elite are the same way.
[00:41:45.426 --> 00:41:53.270]  They understand that this is basically something that limits your humanity.
[00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:57.352]  Now I will say, I will go see a Coen Brothers movie.
[00:41:57.352 --> 00:42:01.855]  The new one, Hell, Caesar, is excellent.
[00:42:03.198 --> 00:42:11.886]  I'm not going to spoil it, but it's anti-communist, but very sophisticated, and it is really deep.
[00:42:11.886 --> 00:42:20.734]  Now, I will say, I don't say this in elitist fashion, I don't think hardly anybody but the Coen brothers are going to get it.
[00:42:20.734 --> 00:42:22.096]  Now, it's a big hit.
[00:42:22.096 --> 00:42:23.237]  It has rave reviews.
[00:42:25.182 --> 00:42:26.483]  And it's multifaceted.
[00:42:26.483 --> 00:42:29.024]  See what Hollywood was like in the 50s.
[00:42:29.024 --> 00:42:31.946]  See a lot of famous scenes in Hollywood redone.
[00:42:31.946 --> 00:42:37.329]  See it in HD color.
[00:42:37.329 --> 00:42:39.650]  See how the studios worked and operated.
[00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:49.635]  But it's really a Christ allegory in a very pro-Christian film.
[00:42:49.635 --> 00:42:52.477]  And almost anti-Orthodox Jew.
[00:42:53.727 --> 00:42:56.569]  It was just unbelievably sophisticated.
[00:42:56.569 --> 00:43:05.956]  In fact, I've got to go see it two or three more times because it was so sophisticated.
[00:43:05.956 --> 00:43:08.098]  But I digress.
[00:43:08.098 --> 00:43:12.661]  It's got a lot of facets to it.
[00:43:12.661 --> 00:43:14.762]  So it's not something you go drink a few beers and watch.
[00:43:14.762 --> 00:43:17.985]  You want to go really pay attention to it to try to get all the levels.
[00:43:20.615 --> 00:43:29.417]  And of course, the main character is a Christ figure himself.
[00:43:29.417 --> 00:43:30.617]  It's strong.
[00:43:30.617 --> 00:43:32.557]  Very esoteric.
[00:43:32.557 --> 00:43:38.259]  Very hidden.
[00:43:38.259 --> 00:43:39.759]  Alright.
[00:43:39.759 --> 00:43:43.680]  Let's continue here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:44.680]  Let me give you the secret of the film.
[00:43:45.911 --> 00:43:51.013]  It's saying you're not going to have communism and collectivism from a centralized top-down system.
[00:43:51.013 --> 00:43:55.054]  You're going to have it through something like Jesus Christ.
[00:43:55.054 --> 00:44:11.119]  Because it's not communism, it's individualism and professionalism and love exercised to everyone, then frees humanity and allows people to excel at what they themselves are good at, but that we're not all equal in every way.
[00:44:12.449 --> 00:44:15.570]  We're just born equally free if we have that potential.
[00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:23.472]  And I'm dumbing that down.
[00:44:23.472 --> 00:44:28.714]  But it basically says Jesus Christ can fix the world.
[00:44:28.714 --> 00:44:31.115]  I mean, are the Coen Brothers closet Christians or something?
[00:44:31.115 --> 00:44:31.935]  I just couldn't believe it.
[00:44:32.697 --> 00:44:40.720]  And by the way, it's not done double-edged, and I just don't get the sophistication that it was something that different audiences see as for them.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.160]  That's a classic paradigm.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.041]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:44:44.041 --> 00:44:46.301]  That's not... I watch it very, very closely.
[00:44:46.301 --> 00:44:47.042]  Okay, I digress.
[00:44:47.042 --> 00:44:48.902]  We've got big guests coming up and a ton of news.
[00:44:48.902 --> 00:44:49.682]  I can get into it right now.
[00:44:49.682 --> 00:44:54.104]  I'm just going to run through this stuff fast here, but before I do that...
[00:44:55.279 --> 00:44:58.501]  Supermail Vitality is basically sold out.
[00:44:58.501 --> 00:44:59.862]  Today, we're going to have to pull it.
[00:44:59.862 --> 00:45:03.684]  You have to hold back some bottles for folks that are signed up with AutoShip.
[00:45:03.684 --> 00:45:09.028]  The way to never sell out of any of the products that we've developed or have is to sign up for AutoShip.
[00:45:09.028 --> 00:45:12.490]  The particular items you want, you can set up for a month, two months, three months, whatever you want.
[00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:17.133]  Cancel any time, but you get 10% off.
[00:45:17.133 --> 00:45:21.876]  10% off on it and things that are sold out
[00:45:23.254 --> 00:45:28.236]  We hold back stuff for folks that are on AutoShip, as a necessity.
[00:45:28.236 --> 00:45:34.077]  Supermail will sell out today, but it will be available if you sign up for AutoShip.
[00:45:34.077 --> 00:45:44.901]  Superfemale is still available, probably will sell out next week, and it basically is almost the same formula, but a little bit tweaked for women, but men can take it, it isn't harmful, but these are powerful formulas.
[00:45:44.901 --> 00:45:49.663]  Just try them, and your purchase helps fund the broadcast, you really can't lose on that front.
[00:45:49.663 --> 00:45:50.283]  Now this is what
[00:45:52.219 --> 00:45:57.321]  Fella in Boise, Idaho said, Guide said, this is a far superior to other products I've tried in the past.
[00:45:57.321 --> 00:46:01.964]  Stamina and clarity, especially in the mornings with no running out of gas in the afternoon.
[00:46:01.964 --> 00:46:05.866]  It works for me and I have noticed a better recovery after my workouts.
[00:46:05.866 --> 00:46:06.506]  Five star review.
[00:46:06.506 --> 00:46:08.187]  Thank you for the review.
[00:46:08.187 --> 00:46:15.210]  Here's another one by Wild Bill in Clarksville, MS.
[00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:19.372]  Acts quickly, awesome, good taste, no side effects, produces results, simple to take.
[00:46:19.372 --> 00:46:21.273]  I've only used this product twice and already lost
[00:46:22.796 --> 00:46:24.137]  I guess it means two rounds.
[00:46:24.137 --> 00:46:25.178]  Forty-five pounds.
[00:46:25.178 --> 00:46:26.519]  I just ordered a third bottle.
[00:46:26.519 --> 00:46:29.662]  So I've noticed my stress has gone and I'm always in a great mood.
[00:46:29.662 --> 00:46:31.223]  I love this stuff.
[00:46:31.223 --> 00:46:32.524]  Yeah, it sits over the top.
[00:46:34.332 --> 00:46:39.416]  All I know is most people are sold when they take a few droppers of it, and within a day or two, they really notice something in the morning of their men.
[00:46:39.416 --> 00:46:40.777]  I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[00:46:40.777 --> 00:46:45.121]  Liver Shield is back in stock, and you take it with the Oxy-Powder.
[00:46:45.121 --> 00:46:47.543]  It's a seven-day regimen, and it's unbelievable.
[00:46:47.543 --> 00:46:48.543]  Go see the details for yourself.
[00:46:48.543 --> 00:46:49.784]  That's back in stock.
[00:46:49.784 --> 00:46:53.147]  This is a Liver Shield review by Carl in the UK.
[00:46:53.147 --> 00:46:53.707]  It works.
[00:46:53.707 --> 00:46:55.929]  This is hardcore detox stuff.
[00:46:55.929 --> 00:46:57.831]  I would advise anyone to read up on this one.
[00:46:57.831 --> 00:47:00.873]  It works.
[00:47:00.873 --> 00:47:01.273]  So again,
[00:47:02.242 --> 00:47:05.805]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:47:05.805 --> 00:47:11.610]  We have the Hillary, the new Hillary for Prison limited edition shirt in.
[00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:15.933]  At infowarsstore.com, that's the big blanket system.
[00:47:15.933 --> 00:47:26.062]  And then you can find the entire longevity line of products discounted when you sign up for auto ship or become a distributor at infowarshealth.com or infowarsteam.com.
[00:47:26.062 --> 00:47:26.262]  Okay.
[00:47:28.012 --> 00:47:31.153]  Let me do this in the three minutes before break, in the next little six minute segment.
[00:47:31.153 --> 00:47:34.275]  Then I'm going to go into detail in the next hour before our guest joins us.
[00:47:34.275 --> 00:47:36.456]  And Reeves is popping in as well.
[00:47:36.456 --> 00:47:39.197]  Let me just do it this way.
[00:47:39.197 --> 00:47:42.738]  Starting with the stack I already began with, but then going through it.
[00:47:42.738 --> 00:47:46.180]  Scientists ponder the prospect of contagious cancer.
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:50.021]  New York Times.
[00:47:50.021 --> 00:47:54.383]  Supercondom backed by Texas A&M and Gates Foundation targets diseases.
[00:47:54.383 --> 00:47:56.024]  Uh-huh.
[00:47:56.024 --> 00:47:56.364]  Uh-huh.
[00:47:57.984 --> 00:48:03.588]  Gates has got some medicine he wants you to put on you.
[00:48:03.588 --> 00:48:13.555]  Hitler had a tiny deformed member, must have been using Bill Gates condoms, as well as one testicle historian claims.
[00:48:13.555 --> 00:48:18.758]  MWC 2016 Sony puts AI assistant in one's ear.
[00:48:18.758 --> 00:48:21.120]  Yes, the chipping of the brain begins.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:24.042]  The creeping in, the worming in of the wires.
[00:48:27.076 --> 00:48:29.977]  I'm not starting with the most important news, I'm just getting right into it.
[00:48:29.977 --> 00:48:30.337]  U.S.
[00:48:30.337 --> 00:48:38.980]  scrambles to contain growing ISIS threat in Libya, New York Times, that our government put there.
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:46.742]  Crowd cheers as German migrant hotel is burned out, even as they try to stop firefighters battling the blaze.
[00:48:46.742 --> 00:48:48.343]  Yep, the Germans are getting mad.
[00:48:48.343 --> 00:48:52.864]  Largest ever U.S.-South Korea drill planned as a warning to North Korea.
[00:48:52.864 --> 00:48:54.165]  North Korea threatens to nuke the South.
[00:48:56.172 --> 00:49:00.334]  Across Europe, gay migrants face abuse in asylum shelters.
[00:49:00.334 --> 00:49:05.435]  Well, it's okay when the Muslims do it.
[00:49:05.435 --> 00:49:07.336]  Zika has been linked to birth defects.
[00:49:07.336 --> 00:49:10.157]  Now it may be causing paralysis.
[00:49:10.157 --> 00:49:12.738]  That's exactly what our bioweapons expert said.
[00:49:12.738 --> 00:49:14.038]  He said it's actually a bunch of stuff.
[00:49:14.038 --> 00:49:14.759]  It's not just Zika.
[00:49:14.759 --> 00:49:16.699]  That's a cover.
[00:49:16.699 --> 00:49:17.220]  The U.S.
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:17.560]  states
[00:49:18.547 --> 00:49:23.770]  Where recession is already a reality, and it breaks down how Moody's and other analytics say that a bunch of U.S.
[00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:26.291]  states are already in deep recession or depression.
[00:49:26.291 --> 00:49:29.672]  Yeah, again, the depression's here, it's just not evenly distributed.
[00:49:29.672 --> 00:49:39.997]  Now let's get into the really important meat and potatoes right now, and I'll cover the election when we come back.
[00:49:39.997 --> 00:49:42.599]  EU has no plan B if Britain votes to quit EU.
[00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:45.101]  That's Reuters.
[00:49:45.101 --> 00:49:49.042]  Well, about 90% of the laws, it was 80%, get made by the EU.
[00:49:49.042 --> 00:49:50.683]  It's totally wrecking the country.
[00:49:50.683 --> 00:49:51.983]  It's designed to suck them dry.
[00:49:51.983 --> 00:50:01.307]  Even the super-ultra-liberal mayor of London backs the British exit, or Brexit.
[00:50:01.307 --> 00:50:04.189]  Because the Brits now understand the EU is a tyranny.
[00:50:04.189 --> 00:50:09.931]  Their founders, people like... You name it.
[00:50:09.931 --> 00:50:10.551]  What's his name?
[00:50:10.551 --> 00:50:11.912]  I don't have a teleprompter.
[00:50:13.184 --> 00:50:26.651]  Peter Sutherland, the founder of the EU, now the head of the quote migrant office, that's the invasion office, says we want to end the Western culture, it's bad, you can pull up his quotes, we want to bankrupt, we want to take everybody over, we want to end wealth.
[00:50:26.651 --> 00:50:31.173]  Remember that came out last week, that the carbon tax is about making you poor?
[00:50:31.173 --> 00:50:35.175]  So we're good to all that, even the Liberals now are against it.
[00:50:35.175 --> 00:50:38.096]  EU referendum, Cameron sets June date for UK vote.
[00:50:39.295 --> 00:50:40.236]  But here's the big secret.
[00:50:40.236 --> 00:50:48.263]  They're probably going to shoot it down at the end, even though it's popular to get out, just like Scotland, claiming people at the last minute didn't want to.
[00:50:48.263 --> 00:50:53.307]  But have the politicians act like they're against it, because upwards of 85% don't want to be in the Euro.
[00:50:53.307 --> 00:50:55.069]  That's my call.
[00:50:55.069 --> 00:50:55.429]  Stay with us.
[00:50:58.907 --> 00:51:00.869]  Are you tired of the cold this winter?
[00:51:00.869 --> 00:51:03.872]  Are you prepared for the next blizzard or snowstorm?
[00:51:03.872 --> 00:51:06.394]  What will you do when the power and heat go off?
[00:51:06.394 --> 00:51:08.015]  That could be our future.
[00:51:08.015 --> 00:51:14.941]  Fortress Clothing's Bug Out Bag with our head-to-toe solution is your one-step answer to survival in the cold.

[00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:02.792]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:53:02.792 --> 00:53:03.432]  It's true.
[00:53:03.432 --> 00:53:07.573]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:53:07.573 --> 00:53:09.974]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:53:09.974 --> 00:53:14.436]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[00:54:02.884 --> 00:54:06.505]  Good old Jimmy Bond bringing us in.
[00:54:06.505 --> 00:54:07.566]  He is such a patriot.
[00:54:07.566 --> 00:54:13.908]  He was over at the house with his lovely wife just last weekend at my daughter's birthday party.
[00:54:13.908 --> 00:54:16.449]  Bop-a-boom!
[00:54:16.449 --> 00:54:21.271]  He's a great guy coming here to play acoustic.
[00:54:21.271 --> 00:54:23.491]  But he's too humble.
[00:54:23.491 --> 00:54:24.832]  He likes the show too much.
[00:54:24.832 --> 00:54:26.012]  He can go play in front of 100,000 people.
[00:54:28.362 --> 00:54:33.444]  Go on tour with ZZ Top or Bob Dylan, but he gets the butterflies coming here.
[00:54:33.444 --> 00:54:35.144]  Jimmy, you're going to come in and come on the show.
[00:54:35.144 --> 00:54:38.125]  So, we're going to get that going.
[00:54:38.125 --> 00:54:40.506]  Alright, let me jump into the news here.
[00:54:40.506 --> 00:54:42.647]  I'm not name dropping, I'm just thinking of my old buddy.
[00:54:42.647 --> 00:54:45.228]  I've known him like 15 years.
[00:54:45.228 --> 00:54:48.129]  Then before he got married again, before he had his daughters, everything.
[00:54:48.129 --> 00:54:50.529]  Alright, side issue.
[00:54:50.529 --> 00:54:52.570]  Boy, he's got some cool classic cars.
[00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:57.172]  Speaking of the Coen Brothers movie, they've got this Texas cowboy character.
[00:54:58.168 --> 00:55:00.849]  Do you think he's real dumb?
[00:55:00.849 --> 00:55:06.290]  And then, of course, he's real smart and actually helps save the day.
[00:55:06.290 --> 00:55:10.692]  You know, just stuff like that, because it shows all these Easterners making fun of him, thinking he's stupid.
[00:55:10.692 --> 00:55:16.413]  I mean, the Coen brothers just really get it on so many levels.
[00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:16.853]  They really do.
[00:55:16.853 --> 00:55:21.355]  Because that's a whole thing in places like Texas, where people act real friendly and nice.
[00:55:21.355 --> 00:55:22.275]  They are friendly and nice.
[00:55:22.275 --> 00:55:25.796]  They don't show off and tell you what's really going on behind their eyes.
[00:55:26.786 --> 00:55:31.187]  And then they can just get sophisticated on you in about half a second flat.
[00:55:31.187 --> 00:55:33.727]  And then nothing is focused on the East Coast or Europe or whatever.
[00:55:33.727 --> 00:55:34.467]  They just come around.
[00:55:34.467 --> 00:55:40.489]  I think people in Texas or other areas ride horses to work, or if we do, you know, that we can hardly tie our shoelaces.
[00:55:40.489 --> 00:55:41.569]  And it's kind of the opposite.
[00:55:41.569 --> 00:55:44.549]  Living in big cities is what domesticates you, in my experience.
[00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:45.930]  Okay.
[00:55:45.930 --> 00:55:51.050]  So, EU has no plan, no B plan, and Britain votes no to quit.
[00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:53.491]  London Mayor Johnson backs Briggs exit.
[00:55:56.345 --> 00:55:58.707]  That continues.
[00:55:58.707 --> 00:55:59.828]  EU referendum.
[00:55:59.828 --> 00:56:03.731]  Cameron sets June date for UK vote.
[00:56:03.731 --> 00:56:05.272]  Huge.
[00:56:05.272 --> 00:56:07.534]  US-EU open free trade talks in Brussels.
[00:56:07.534 --> 00:56:15.761]  That means the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the North Atlantic Agreement that Bush signed with Merkel and Barroso is now actually being finished.
[00:56:15.761 --> 00:56:25.809]  That's merging us with the EU and the EU and the US in between the Pacific then merge under the Trans-Pacific Partnership into the Asian Union.
[00:56:27.093 --> 00:56:28.694]  And that's world government.
[00:56:28.694 --> 00:56:31.256]  Speaking of the EU, Twitter bans conservative blogger.
[00:56:31.256 --> 00:56:32.476]  Killed Trump account.
[00:56:32.476 --> 00:56:34.077]  Still active since months later.
[00:56:34.077 --> 00:56:36.159]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[00:56:36.159 --> 00:56:41.122]  French president threatens to suspend nations that elect far-right politicians.
[00:56:41.122 --> 00:56:44.944]  You won't be able to travel into other countries anymore.
[00:56:44.944 --> 00:56:52.469]  You'll basically be a prisoner if you elect somebody like Marie Le Pen, who is about as conservative as Marco Rubio.
[00:56:52.469 --> 00:56:53.609]  I mean, she's not that conservative.
[00:56:53.609 --> 00:56:54.490]  She's not even that hardcore.
[00:56:56.189 --> 00:56:58.170]  They just want everything banned, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:58.170 --> 00:57:02.614]  This is the total tyranny we see unfolding worldwide.
[00:57:02.614 --> 00:57:08.738]  Now, I've got more in that stack I want to get to, but let me start getting into what's coming up.
[00:57:08.738 --> 00:57:13.282]  We'll have Richard Reeves pop in from Nevada with the big Republican caucus coming up tomorrow.
[00:57:14.215 --> 00:57:16.276]  He'll be joining us via video connection.
[00:57:16.276 --> 00:57:18.498]  And we've got special guests I'm going to tell you about at the start of the next hour.
[00:57:18.498 --> 00:57:20.259]  They're going to be in studio.
[00:57:20.259 --> 00:57:22.560]  I don't usually have my head spinning with a guest.
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:25.862]  I mean, I know who this guy is and this other guy I got with him and all this intrigue.
[00:57:25.862 --> 00:57:29.384]  And Kevin Booth takes like three, four, five years to make a film.
[00:57:29.384 --> 00:57:31.266]  So it's always changing, which is good.
[00:57:31.266 --> 00:57:34.728]  He's had shows on Showtime, you know, you name it.
[00:57:34.728 --> 00:57:39.090]  And I've been a consultant on some of them and been in some of them.
[00:57:39.090 --> 00:57:39.651]  But the point is,
[00:57:40.578 --> 00:57:52.345]  This turned out to be a film about the drug war and marijuana and now it's turned into Eastern Europe and Al-Qaeda training bases and political dissidence and I've seen some of the footage that's in the upcoming film.
[00:57:52.345 --> 00:57:54.847]  I mean, it's crazy.
[00:57:54.847 --> 00:57:56.828]  Kevin's got to go around with all these bodyguards and stuff.
[00:57:56.828 --> 00:57:57.348]  It's just wild.
[00:57:57.348 --> 00:57:58.569]  So they're going to be in the studio.
[00:57:58.569 --> 00:57:59.990]  I'll tell you about those guys coming up as well.
[00:58:02.305 --> 00:58:06.467]  is threatening to use tactical nuclear weapons in Syria.
[00:58:06.467 --> 00:58:16.592]  Well, that's just part of the default setting of NATO, the United States and Russia, that if you have a force overwhelmed by a ground force, use tactical nuclear weapons to defeat them.
[00:58:16.592 --> 00:58:22.135]  But that's a big deal that Saudi Arabia says they're about to invade with ground troops into Syria.
[00:58:22.135 --> 00:58:23.435]  And say what you want, folks.
[00:58:23.435 --> 00:58:24.236]  I don't take sides here.
[00:58:24.236 --> 00:58:25.156]  I've never been to Russia.
[00:58:25.156 --> 00:58:27.557]  I'm not lionizing Vladimir Putin.
[00:58:27.557 --> 00:58:28.458]  My issue is
[00:58:29.478 --> 00:58:31.160]  Syria has invited Putin in.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.841]  This is on Russia's doorstep.
[00:58:32.841 --> 00:58:34.783]  The West is starting these wars.
[00:58:34.783 --> 00:58:38.767]  Look what they've done in Libya!

[00:59:45.165 --> 00:59:47.346]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:01.388 --> 01:00:08.029]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:08.029 --> 01:00:14.250]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:25.432]  Richard Reeves is popping in for five minutes to start the next segment, then I'm going to tell you about the big guest we've got coming in here at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:25.432 --> 01:00:29.833]  I was getting into the Russia situation, but I'm going to do that some with our guest.
[01:00:30.875 --> 01:00:36.579]  Because their home base is over in Eastern Europe and they can speak to that as well.
[01:00:36.579 --> 01:00:41.202]  So we'll explore this along with the War on Drugs and more.
[01:00:41.202 --> 01:00:51.469]  Our guest has a company valued at $4 billion and is one of the biggest suppliers of accoutrement for the
[01:00:54.156 --> 01:00:55.697]  Farming of certain things.
[01:00:55.697 --> 01:01:04.682]  I'll just leave it at that until they're in studio with us, coming up in T-minus 31 minutes.
[01:01:04.682 --> 01:01:13.548]  In this short little segment though, I want to get into the iPhone situation, then we'll come back into the election, then into Russia, then into more.
[01:01:13.548 --> 01:01:19.291]  But I'm not here trying to start a fight with anybody.
[01:01:19.291 --> 01:01:21.433]  I don't wish harm upon the Muslims.
[01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:24.431]  Even the evil Wahhabists.
[01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:28.374]  I just want them to stop doing horrible things to people.
[01:01:28.374 --> 01:01:40.643]  I don't want to be in a fight with some of the American militia, who are very patriotic good people, but who are infiltrated in many cases and being manipulated like a magician's trick.
[01:01:40.643 --> 01:01:42.164]  I don't want to be in a fight with the police.
[01:01:42.164 --> 01:01:44.146]  I don't want to be in a fight with Black Lives Matter.
[01:01:44.146 --> 01:01:45.787]  I don't want to be in a fight with anybody.
[01:01:45.787 --> 01:01:46.868]  So I went and met with Louis Fairchild.
[01:01:52.267 --> 01:01:55.529]  I know there's different factions in federal agencies.
[01:01:55.529 --> 01:02:05.454]  I know the FBI has done a lot of really good things, but also there are different elements of the FBI and different administrations that have done really bad things.
[01:02:05.454 --> 01:02:07.876]  And I've tried to really study this Apple situation.
[01:02:07.876 --> 01:02:16.861]  I've talked to engineers and others, and they say that the algorithm to get into an iPhone is connected to the passcode, and that there is a master key that Apple has.
[01:02:18.533 --> 01:02:26.640]  And then if that gets out, it would compromise the entire platform of the biggest company in the world, and that could cause a depression in and of itself.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:34.668]  The FBI director has come out, and I've got his quote, and he says, don't panic, it's not the end of the world.
[01:02:34.668 --> 01:02:40.213]  And he comes off as better than some of the last directors, so far what he's done, so I reserve judgment.
[01:02:40.213 --> 01:02:42.615]  And he says, all we want is into this particular phone.
[01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:49.633]  Well, why don't you have a relationship then to have a deal with Apple where you can go in, and then Apple opens it for you.
[01:02:49.633 --> 01:02:51.494]  And then you don't get the code.
[01:02:51.494 --> 01:02:55.237]  But here's what I said in a video message of Trump saying, I think overall he's wrong on this.
[01:02:55.237 --> 01:03:02.361]  Not that he's wrong, he's right morally to say, hey, they got a warrant, give them the code, let them into that particular phone.
[01:03:02.361 --> 01:03:06.704]  But see, it could let them into more than just that instead of precedent.
[01:03:06.704 --> 01:03:13.448]  It's not that Apple's a good company, they're very evil, run some of the worst factories, they fund anti-gun stuff, they're bad news.
[01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:16.314]  I'm not defending Apple.
[01:03:16.314 --> 01:03:24.781]  I'm saying that the users of it understand that if you start compromising its encryption and things, because that's what the FBI wants.
[01:03:24.781 --> 01:03:25.562]  They want it all.
[01:03:25.562 --> 01:03:26.423]  In the past, they have.
[01:03:26.423 --> 01:03:32.608]  They're making it a cause célèbre right now about this particular phone, just to kind of dumb the debate down to put pressure on Apple.
[01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:34.189]  But that's kind of blown up in the FBI's face.
[01:03:34.189 --> 01:03:35.471]  Here it is, MarketWatch.
[01:03:35.471 --> 01:03:39.134]  FBI boss to Apple backers, stop saying the world is ending.
[01:03:40.353 --> 01:03:44.274]  We don't want to break anyone's encryption or set a master key loose on the land.
[01:03:44.274 --> 01:03:46.334]  Yeah, but what have other agencies of the government done?
[01:03:46.334 --> 01:03:50.055]  And big banks keep, you know, releasing 30 million social security numbers at a pop.
[01:03:50.055 --> 01:03:53.136]  It's the big institutions that are full of mercenaries and groups.
[01:03:53.136 --> 01:04:00.078]  You're not telling me that in the whole federal government you get thousands of people with access to stuff like this that isn't going to get sold and leaked?
[01:04:00.078 --> 01:04:03.899]  Or that your computers aren't going to get broken into by God knows who and released?
[01:04:03.899 --> 01:04:06.499]  Come on!
[01:04:06.499 --> 01:04:08.140]  Big corporations are the number one leakers.
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:09.780]  Next is the federal government and other governments.
[01:04:11.457 --> 01:04:13.878]  So, no, you don't need this.
[01:04:13.878 --> 01:04:19.079]  But at the same time, Apple should get them into the phone.
[01:04:19.079 --> 01:04:25.740]  Separately, they can go to the ISP and the cellular provider the day after.
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:27.260]  They keep that stuff for years by law.
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:31.861]  They've got where they went, who they called, the web addresses they went to.
[01:04:31.861 --> 01:04:32.701]  Give me a break.
[01:04:32.701 --> 01:04:34.002]  The whole history's there.
[01:04:34.002 --> 01:04:35.902]  So the whole thing's a red herring on every front.
[01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:41.062]  And then Trump kind of walked into it, going, hey, give them the code, we're going to boycott you.
[01:04:41.062 --> 01:04:43.284]  And it's more than just give them the code.
[01:04:43.284 --> 01:04:47.206]  But I get it.
[01:04:47.206 --> 01:04:50.848]  Some of Apple's encryption gets in the way of the FBI.
[01:04:50.848 --> 01:04:52.569]  And I'm sure with some of this stuff, they're doing good things.
[01:04:52.569 --> 01:04:55.391]  But overall, we're all being spied on and we're less free than ever.
[01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:56.772]  So folks don't buy it anymore.
[01:04:58.854 --> 01:05:01.156]  Jeb Bush is out of the presidential race.
[01:05:01.156 --> 01:05:12.186]  The former Florida governor has dropped out of the 2016 White House race after losing the South Carolina primary badly to billionaire Donald Trump, who secured a strong victory with nearly a third of the vote.
[01:05:12.186 --> 01:05:16.810]  Bush formally launched his campaign back in June, about six months after he announced he would run for top office.
[01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:23.954]  He was supported by the Right to Rise Political Action Committee, which had raised in excess of $100 million for his campaign launch.
[01:05:23.954 --> 01:05:35.299]  But no amount of money could save Bush, a dorky candidate who at one point actually begged the audience to please clap for him after his speech, and was hilariously thrown off the stage at another speech for going over his allotted time.
[01:05:35.299 --> 01:05:40.022]  People are simply tired of establishment candidates who want amnesty for illegals flooding into the country.
[01:05:40.202 --> 01:05:50.886]  It also didn't help that Bush blew off the idea of releasing the missing 28 pages from the 9-11 report, which were classified not because of national security, but because they reveal Saudi Arabia's involvement in the attacks.

[01:07:04.117 --> 01:07:15.469]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on

[01:08:10.527 --> 01:08:16.731]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:16.731 --> 01:08:26.038]  Michael Straumaitis is going to be joining us in studio.
[01:08:27.722 --> 01:08:34.844]  With political activists from Eastern Europe, you name it, one of his companies is valued at four billion dollars.
[01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:40.685]  It's one of the biggest hemp growing supply companies, or the biggest in the world.
[01:08:40.685 --> 01:08:50.507]  And the reason he's gonna be joining us at the bottom of the hour, and he's got his wife and crew with him here today, we're gonna do a Facebook mention starting at the start of the next break, then I'm gonna lead him in here and give him a tour.
[01:08:52.389 --> 01:09:00.675]  Is because Kevin Booth, my old friend, filmmaker, started making a film about marijuana and hemp.
[01:09:00.675 --> 01:09:08.420]  And then it turned into one about Eastern Europe, Vladimir Putin, both sides of that equation.
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:12.643]  And, I mean, Kevin has been there in the foreign Eastern European countries.
[01:09:12.643 --> 01:09:15.625]  They've discovered the Al-Qaeda training camps.
[01:09:15.625 --> 01:09:18.848]  A lot of his films turn out like this because he just shoots for sometimes five years.
[01:09:19.761 --> 01:09:21.402]  And then it just turns into something completely different.
[01:09:21.402 --> 01:09:23.384]  You talk about fly on the wall, this is it.
[01:09:23.384 --> 01:09:29.029]  To give you an example, I've started out in two of his films and it ended up not being in them at the end.
[01:09:29.029 --> 01:09:30.029]  He's always, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:09:30.029 --> 01:09:30.750]  I'm like, I don't care, man.
[01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:31.471]  That's cool.
[01:09:31.471 --> 01:09:34.173]  The point is, is I get to consult on him.
[01:09:34.173 --> 01:09:38.116]  So this is going to be a pretty powerful interview coming up.
[01:09:38.116 --> 01:09:39.097]  So definitely stay with us.
[01:09:41.553 --> 01:09:53.102]  For all of that, we've also got his buddy Ivan joining us, a former high-tech startup entrepreneur and political activist working for three years to overthrow the mafia regime in Bulgaria.
[01:09:53.102 --> 01:09:55.163]  And Kevin's spent a lot of time over there.
[01:09:55.163 --> 01:09:58.425]  Kevin, I hope, will be in studio with us as well.
[01:09:58.425 --> 01:10:00.567]  We're gonna go to Richard Reeves here in just a moment.
[01:10:00.567 --> 01:10:04.230]  If your stations out there just joined us, the big news is
[01:10:05.785 --> 01:10:11.308]  Russia has reached a deal with the U.S., according to Reuters, to have a Syrian ceasefire on February 27th.
[01:10:11.308 --> 01:10:12.428]  We'll see if that holds up.
[01:10:12.428 --> 01:10:28.095]  That's good because the Saudi Arabians have threatened to put tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of ground troops into Syria to battle the Russians there and the Assad regime to prop up their al-Qaeda and ISIS forces.
[01:10:28.095 --> 01:10:34.378]  And Russia has threatened to use tactical nuclear weapons after Saudi Arabia last week said, we have nukes and we'll use them.
[01:10:35.765 --> 01:10:38.086]  So things are escalating in a big, big way.
[01:10:38.086 --> 01:10:47.591]  Finishing up with the whole Apple iPhone situation, I've studied it, I have looked at it in depth, and it's a red herring.
[01:10:47.591 --> 01:10:56.976]  The FBI can go to the internet service provider and the cellular provider and get the entire history of who they called, what websites they visited, and what they did.
[01:11:00.293 --> 01:11:04.315]  Also, there are ways to go around the encryption.
[01:11:04.315 --> 01:11:05.475]  You don't go through it.
[01:11:05.475 --> 01:11:06.135]  You go around it.
[01:11:06.135 --> 01:11:07.376]  You don't go through the interface.
[01:11:07.376 --> 01:11:08.736]  That's basically impossible.
[01:11:08.736 --> 01:11:10.297]  You go around it.
[01:11:10.297 --> 01:11:13.958]  And the FBI director says, hey, we don't want the master key and we're not going to turn it loose.
[01:11:13.958 --> 01:11:22.702]  They're turning this into a fake referendum saying, let us into this one terrorist phone to make it look like all encryption is this simple or this simple of an issue.
[01:11:23.462 --> 01:11:27.705]  to sell the idea of a major takeover of more of our rights.
[01:11:27.705 --> 01:11:31.568]  The truth is we've never been more surveilled and we've never been more unsafe.
[01:11:31.568 --> 01:11:37.173]  We've gone from Al-Qaeda being 3,000 people to now ISIS being 200,000 with our own government funding.
[01:11:37.173 --> 01:11:45.720]  And the Justice Department blocked the FBI two years ago from stopping the two shooters when they were specifically investigating them.
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:51.024]  They had the Justice Department come down and say, we might indict you for civil rights violations.
[01:11:51.024 --> 01:11:52.285]  Don't investigate this mosque.
[01:11:53.536 --> 01:11:57.679]  Don't investigate these two particular people.
[01:11:57.679 --> 01:11:58.340]  Amazing.
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:13.032]  But the Justice Department says their main focus is patriots and liberty groups, even though statistically the crime rate's one of the lowest out there, and they want to change the Patriot Act to say material support for anyone that's anti-government.
[01:12:13.032 --> 01:12:15.514]  That's like Ron Paul.
[01:12:15.514 --> 01:12:18.076]  But that's where this is going if we let them get there.
[01:12:18.936 --> 01:12:22.197]  We have to fight now for free speech and stop them getting there.
[01:12:22.197 --> 01:12:25.098]  Not roll over and say, oh that's scary, I better shut up.
[01:12:25.098 --> 01:12:31.760]  That will guarantee our enslavement will just be like one more third world country that lives in fear.
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:35.542]  You go to a freer country, folks will talk about the government, they'll talk about issues, they'll get on camera.
[01:12:35.542 --> 01:12:37.142]  You go to third world countries, folks are scared.
[01:12:37.142 --> 01:12:38.943]  You go to Spain, people are scared.
[01:12:38.943 --> 01:12:41.263]  Not what was a first world nation.
[01:12:41.263 --> 01:12:42.884]  They banned free speech there last year.
[01:12:42.884 --> 01:12:44.084]  Now Germany's doing it.
[01:12:44.084 --> 01:12:46.565]  Now France is doing it.
[01:12:46.565 --> 01:12:48.386]  Using the radical jihadists they brought in,
[01:12:51.056 --> 01:12:56.661]  As the pretext to take everybody else's rights.
[01:12:56.661 --> 01:12:58.062]  So that's coming up as well.
[01:12:58.062 --> 01:13:05.849]  Now getting into the huge election news, we're going to Richard Reeves here in about 60 seconds in Nevada with the Republican caucuses tomorrow.
[01:13:05.849 --> 01:13:14.136]  Hillary got 50 plus percent and got all the delegates and they're talking about Sanders being out within two weeks.
[01:13:15.578 --> 01:13:19.082]  See, it doesn't matter that he won by 20 points in New Hampshire.
[01:13:19.082 --> 01:13:20.043]  They just stole that.
[01:13:20.043 --> 01:13:22.926]  They had Hillary people registering after they voted.
[01:13:22.926 --> 01:13:30.834]  The Justice Department is in the news today saying that they're going to make sure that illegal aliens can vote and that no one checks IDs all across the United States.
[01:13:30.834 --> 01:13:37.001]  I mean, this is the ongoing criminal activity of Loretta Lynch, who may be our new Supreme Court Justice.
[01:13:42.816 --> 01:13:48.521]  So continuing, first Massachusetts poll shows Trump with huge lead.
[01:13:48.521 --> 01:13:53.565]  And Trump is at 50%.
[01:13:53.565 --> 01:13:58.008]  Marco Rubio at 16, Kasich at 13, Carson at 10.
[01:13:58.008 --> 01:14:04.974]  And boy, they are really trying to prop up these people right now.
[01:14:04.974 --> 01:14:09.378]  They are really trying to prop up Marco Rubio.
[01:14:10.905 --> 01:14:15.206]  Wiggle Room, RNC video highlights Hillary's bare-faced lies.
[01:14:15.206 --> 01:14:19.928]  We're going to play that clip coming up in the next segment.
[01:14:19.928 --> 01:14:24.329]  Delegate count leaving Bernie Sanders with steep climb.
[01:14:24.329 --> 01:14:31.951]  Oh, the New York Times goes on to admit it doesn't matter if he wins, Hillary gets the delegates because, well, that's how the Democrats change the rules.
[01:14:31.951 --> 01:14:33.892]  She's not stealing, they change the rules.
[01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:37.591]  It's like saying, oh, child molestation's legal now.
[01:14:37.591 --> 01:14:38.152]  We said so.
[01:14:38.152 --> 01:14:39.252]  Well, no, it's not.
[01:14:39.252 --> 01:14:40.473]  I don't care if you say it's legal.
[01:14:40.473 --> 01:14:43.735]  I don't care if Obama signs an executive order saying the border's open.
[01:14:43.735 --> 01:14:45.356]  It's treason.
[01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:47.737]  He doesn't have that power.
[01:14:47.737 --> 01:14:51.239]  Thanks to superdelegates, Hillary might be assured of nominee.
[01:14:51.239 --> 01:14:52.279]  Oh, this doesn't matter.
[01:14:52.279 --> 01:14:53.860]  It's so magic.
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:55.121]  Here's that article I mentioned.
[01:14:55.121 --> 01:15:00.544]  The Obama administration wants to make sure non-citizens vote in the upcoming election.
[01:15:00.544 --> 01:15:01.705]  They just admit it.
[01:15:03.766 --> 01:15:05.087]  The unions say there's no split.
[01:15:05.087 --> 01:15:07.289]  They'll support Hillary Clinton.
[01:15:07.289 --> 01:15:08.790]  The requiem for the Bush dynasty.
[01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:10.392]  The fall of the Bush dynasty.
[01:15:10.392 --> 01:15:11.373]  Vanity Fair.
[01:15:11.373 --> 01:15:12.894]  That's exactly what happened.
[01:15:12.894 --> 01:15:16.877]  And that's the message here.
[01:15:16.877 --> 01:15:18.699]  Now, Reeves is about to be kicked out of wherever he is.
[01:15:18.699 --> 01:15:19.700]  We'll go to Reeves right now.
[01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:21.321]  Richard Reeves, what's happening there in Nevada?
[01:15:21.321 --> 01:15:21.762]  Where are you?
[01:15:22.955 --> 01:15:37.815]  Alright Alex, we are at Trump International Hotel where there's a big event scheduled here for Donald Trump and I heard you earlier talking about the situation with Facebook where they're trying to bring in the zombies to be controlled and managed by the globalist Facebook and other social media.
[01:15:38.456 --> 01:15:39.056]  Alex Jones Show!
[01:16:01.262 --> 01:16:06.884]  One thing we haven't talked about Alex is that Donald Trump and Fox and Roger Ailes are at war.
[01:16:06.884 --> 01:16:21.948]  They are at war and you know that's like last week Donald Trump set up an interview with Joe Scarborough MSNBC that was a recorded interview on a Wednesday afternoon that was to be played right up next to O'Reilly at 8 p.m.
[01:16:21.948 --> 01:16:26.850]  Eastern and that to me signaled buddy the war is on so Trump is taking on Fox.
[01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:28.771]  Trump is taking on the Pope.
[01:16:28.771 --> 01:16:31.031]  Trump is taking on 9-11 Truth.
[01:16:31.031 --> 01:16:32.952]  Trump is taking on the RNC.
[01:16:32.952 --> 01:16:34.753]  Trump is taking on the establishment.
[01:16:34.753 --> 01:16:36.513]  Trump is taking on all comers.
[01:16:36.513 --> 01:16:41.115]  He is like King Kong on the Empire State Building, just swatting off all comers.
[01:16:41.115 --> 01:16:49.398]  And now look for the New World Order to rally all their globalist operation mainstream media outlets to go to war against Donald Trump.
[01:16:51.161 --> 01:16:56.045]  Now Richard, I know that you're going to be covering the situation live tomorrow and of course the next day.
[01:16:56.045 --> 01:16:57.686]  You've done a great job out there on the trail.
[01:16:57.686 --> 01:17:00.869]  What do you make of him coming out for 9-11 Truth?
[01:17:00.869 --> 01:17:08.095]  I mean, a lot of people think that that's why Jeb got out quicker because he promised to stay in knowing that Trump was going to keep bringing that up.
[01:17:08.095 --> 01:17:12.299]  We were told five months ago by the Trump folks that they were planning to bring that up and just watch.
[01:17:12.299 --> 01:17:14.420]  And Trump said to me, I'm not going to let you down.
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:15.581]  He hasn't let us down.
[01:17:15.581 --> 01:17:16.142]  This was amazing.
[01:17:17.196 --> 01:17:20.078]  Well, lots of straws break the camel's back.
[01:17:20.078 --> 01:17:25.721]  And I think that 9-11 truth thing that, you know, Donald Trump kept doubling down, tripling down, etc.
[01:17:25.721 --> 01:17:29.783]  Us getting the news out about asking Jeb for the 28 pages, you name it.
[01:17:29.783 --> 01:17:37.208]  All that, plus the pressure on the establishment GOP to finally decide, okay, which of our horses are we going to put all our...
[01:17:37.828 --> 01:17:49.834]  All our money on and that now clearly is the billionaire toy boy, Marco Rubio, which yesterday, that's the first time I've really kind of caught that he's got, he's inbred with political correctness.
[01:17:49.834 --> 01:18:05.621]  So I think that is yet another big Achilles heel that I'll ask the Infowarriors, get us the research about the political correctness of Marco Rubio, because that's a huge Achilles heel, because that's part of what all this election is about, is we've got to stop political correctness and we've got to stop
[01:18:06.121 --> 01:18:07.241]  So many things that are going on.
[01:18:07.241 --> 01:18:07.561]  That's right.
[01:18:07.561 --> 01:18:09.202]  That's how we know Trump's for real.
[01:18:09.202 --> 01:18:20.905]  Everything he's doing is causing irreparable damage to the globalists, their political correctness, their anti-father figure garbage, their war with Russia garbage, their regime change garbage.
[01:18:20.905 --> 01:18:21.905]  We got a minute and a half, Richard.
[01:18:21.905 --> 01:18:24.406]  We're going to check in with you on the nightly news again this evening, 7 o'clock.
[01:18:24.406 --> 01:18:27.787]  But specifically, you're there, you got your ear to the ground.
[01:18:27.787 --> 01:18:30.548]  What are the numbers looking like for Donald Trump in Nevada?
[01:18:31.533 --> 01:18:41.499]  Well, the latest numbers reported are that Donald Trump should win the caucuses, which, you know, the South Carolina primary was less than 48 hours away, it seems like just a second ago.
[01:18:41.499 --> 01:18:44.661]  And now, tomorrow, already, here come the Nevada caucuses.
[01:18:44.661 --> 01:18:47.082]  So, everything is accelerating.
[01:18:47.082 --> 01:18:49.023]  Texas is already early voting.
[01:18:49.023 --> 01:18:54.586]  I'm sure many other states that vote on Super Tuesday, March 1st, are already early voting.
[01:18:54.586 --> 01:18:57.488]  So, things are starting to really, really happen fast.
[01:18:57.868 --> 01:19:01.092]  And on the Democrat side, you were talking about Hillary and Bernie and all that.
[01:19:01.092 --> 01:19:05.839]  We went by a venue yesterday as we were leaving South Carolina, Greenville, South Carolina.
[01:19:05.839 --> 01:19:12.928]  It looked like a National Geographic scene from Antarctica with all the penguins all piled up around a, you know, a big ice flow.
[01:19:13.689 --> 01:19:19.010]  That venue was loaded with Bernie Sanders supporters, so I don't think Bernie's going to go away.
[01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:21.651]  I don't think Bernie's supporters are going to go away.
[01:19:21.651 --> 01:19:29.993]  So New World Order, go ahead and install Hillary as the Democrat nominee, because I think they're going to have a big revolt with those supporters for Bernie.
[01:19:29.993 --> 01:19:32.933]  They're not going to lockstep go in for Hillary in a general election.
[01:19:32.933 --> 01:19:33.473]  They are not.
[01:19:33.473 --> 01:19:34.113]  They're going to split.
[01:19:34.113 --> 01:19:34.894]  They're going to stay home.
[01:19:34.894 --> 01:19:35.914]  They're going to go independent.
[01:19:35.914 --> 01:19:36.714]  They're going to go Trump.
[01:19:37.234 --> 01:19:45.339]  So, go ahead, New World Order, put Hillary up there, because the Hillary Clinton ship hit an iceberg in late December, early January.
[01:19:45.339 --> 01:19:47.680]  She hit the InfoWarrior iceberg with Trump.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:52.043]  Absolutely, that's why the Democrats tried to flush her, but she's holding on with blackmail.
[01:19:52.043 --> 01:19:55.104]  Richard Reeves reporting from Nevada on the Nevada caucuses.
[01:19:55.104 --> 01:19:55.625]  Great job.
[01:19:55.625 --> 01:19:56.045]  We'll be back.

[01:21:59.528 --> 01:22:01.129]  Hi, my name is Nick Lupo.
[01:22:01.129 --> 01:22:04.390]  One World Away has been by far the best protein that I've ever had.
[01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:06.011]  I take it three times a day.
[01:22:06.011 --> 01:22:11.494]  Once in the morning as soon as I wake, once for a pre-workout snack, and once for a post-workout recovery drink.
[01:22:11.494 --> 01:22:15.016]  It has helped me transform and sculpt my body into what I have now.
[01:22:15.016 --> 01:22:20.158]  I began taking the product about two years ago and boy let me tell you, I'm in the best shape of my life.
[01:22:20.158 --> 01:22:23.600]  I've seen major muscle mass gains and have zero percent body fat.
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:28.281]  I have had people in my gym ask if I compete in bodybuilding because of how lean and muscular I am.
[01:22:28.281 --> 01:22:34.702]  I used to suffer from everyday aches and pains from hard manual labor my whole life and arthritis that runs through my family.
[01:22:34.702 --> 01:22:38.963]  But One World Way has helped me take that everyday pain from a 10 to a 3.
[01:22:38.963 --> 01:22:41.824]  Some days I feel no pain at all, just full of life and energy.
[01:22:41.824 --> 01:22:44.904]  It has also helped my skin look younger and healthier.

[01:24:23.946 --> 01:24:27.310]  When you talk about leveling with the American people, have you always told the truth?
[01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:28.111]  I've always tried to.
[01:24:28.111 --> 01:24:29.774]  Always.
[01:24:29.774 --> 01:24:31.976]  Always.
[01:24:31.976 --> 01:24:35.260]  Some people are gonna call that wiggle room that you just gave yourself.
[01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:37.483]  Always, always tried to.
[01:24:37.483 --> 01:24:40.066]  You know, you're asking me to say, have I ever?
[01:24:40.066 --> 01:24:41.248]  I don't believe I ever have.
[01:24:42.465 --> 01:24:43.606]  I don't believe I ever have.
[01:24:43.606 --> 01:24:44.786]  I don't believe I ever will.
[01:24:44.786 --> 01:24:47.727]  I'm going to do the best I can to level with the American people.
[01:24:47.727 --> 01:24:49.828]  I try not to tell lies.
[01:24:49.828 --> 01:24:51.988]  Leanne McAdoo with InfoWars.com.
[01:24:51.988 --> 01:24:53.869]  Let me level with you, America.
[01:24:53.869 --> 01:24:56.890]  Here's just a small sampling of Hillary's whoppers.
[01:24:56.890 --> 01:25:04.973]  There's the Benghazi hearing, using a secret private server to hide her activities, lying about not sharing classified information on that secret server.
[01:25:05.493 --> 01:25:07.714]  I remember landing under sniper fire.
[01:25:07.714 --> 01:25:14.656]  There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles.
[01:25:14.656 --> 01:25:17.057]  Problem is, that's not what happened.
[01:25:17.057 --> 01:25:18.257]  And we should know.
[01:25:18.257 --> 01:25:22.838]  CBS News accompanied the First Lady and daughter Chelsea on that Bosnia trip.
[01:25:22.838 --> 01:25:26.580]  That's Senator Clinton talking to me on the military flight into Tuzla.
[01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:30.501]  And these are the pictures we recorded of the greeting ceremony when the plane landed.
[01:25:30.501 --> 01:25:32.761]  I remember landing under sniper fire.
[01:25:32.761 --> 01:25:34.062]  There was no greeting ceremony.
[01:25:35.836 --> 01:25:36.757]  To Turkey?
[01:25:36.757 --> 01:25:46.125]  Whitewater, Watergate, defending a rapist, threatening all of Bill's bimbos in an effort to keep them quiet, then claiming to run a campaign for women.
[01:25:46.125 --> 01:25:54.873]  I really just want everybody to take a deep breath and relax and just, you know, sit back because here they come again.
[01:25:54.873 --> 01:25:58.176]  We're going to have to just ride through this as we have
[01:25:58.476 --> 01:26:01.141]  Yeah, the vast right-wing conspiracy that you're a criminal.
[01:26:01.141 --> 01:26:04.969]  That's just part of a detailed report up on Infowars.com by Leanne McAdoo.
[01:26:04.969 --> 01:26:06.111]  I suggest you go see it.
[01:26:06.934 --> 01:26:11.375]  Forward it to your friends and family, especially Liberal Democrats that think this lady's good.
[01:26:11.375 --> 01:26:12.556]  Because I really thought about it.
[01:26:12.556 --> 01:26:15.276]  I think Bernie Sanders is better than her, and he's bad news.
[01:26:15.276 --> 01:26:17.817]  I mean, this lady is just a complete monster.
[01:26:17.817 --> 01:26:28.040]  But continuing, the reason I want to play part of McAdoo's report, I Try Not to Lie is the name of that report, is because the RNC has put out this video called Wiggle Room.
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:31.081]  It's 42 seconds long on the lies of Hillary.
[01:26:31.081 --> 01:26:32.181]  Also an effective tool.
[01:26:32.181 --> 01:26:32.501]  Here it is.
[01:26:33.746 --> 01:26:36.908]  Jimmy Carter famously said, I will not lie to you.
[01:26:36.908 --> 01:26:39.649]  He got elected because he made one promise to the American people.
[01:26:39.649 --> 01:26:40.190]  Let's go back to 1976.
[01:26:40.190 --> 01:26:40.750]  I'll never tell a lie.
[01:26:43.650 --> 01:26:45.451]  I'll never make a misleading statement.
[01:26:45.451 --> 01:26:47.432]  You talk about leveling with the American people.
[01:26:47.432 --> 01:26:48.953]  Have you always told the truth?
[01:26:48.953 --> 01:26:54.637]  I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email.
[01:26:54.637 --> 01:26:55.457]  I've always tried to.
[01:26:55.457 --> 01:27:01.041]  The video circulating on the internet that has led to these protests.
[01:27:01.041 --> 01:27:01.841]  I've always tried to.
[01:27:01.841 --> 01:27:04.963]  I did not send classified material.
[01:27:04.963 --> 01:27:06.044]  I've always tried to.
[01:27:06.044 --> 01:27:08.746]  What difference at this point does it make?
[01:27:08.746 --> 01:27:10.727]  Some people are going to call that wiggle room.
[01:27:15.598 --> 01:27:17.539]  There you go.
[01:27:17.539 --> 01:27:20.720]  And really, this is a referendum on Americans.
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:25.143]  Rejecting the Republican establishment in the bushes, rejecting the Clintons.
[01:27:25.143 --> 01:27:30.465]  I mean, how much baloney, how much bull are we going to take?
[01:27:30.465 --> 01:27:33.927]  And the public's got to the point where they're not going to take any more of it.
[01:27:33.927 --> 01:27:42.771]  The problem is that geopolitically, our elite is starting wars with China, starting wars with Russia, starting wars in the Middle East.
[01:27:44.022 --> 01:27:46.304]  And has just gone collectively insane.
[01:27:46.304 --> 01:27:47.985]  Does that mean the communist Chinese are good?
[01:27:47.985 --> 01:27:49.246]  They're horrible!
[01:27:49.246 --> 01:27:50.967]  Does that mean the Russians don't have a bunch of problems?
[01:27:50.967 --> 01:27:52.888]  They got a lot of bad stuff.
[01:27:52.888 --> 01:27:53.789]  It doesn't matter.
[01:27:53.789 --> 01:28:06.878]  Our elite is sitting on top of us, taking our freedoms, and then trying to get us into larger conflicts as political distractions for what they're doing here at home.
[01:28:07.847 --> 01:28:11.453]  And they're gearing up in every way they can to take basic American freedoms.
[01:28:11.453 --> 01:28:22.150]  We're going to go to break and come back with Kevin Booth and two of the subjects of his new film that doesn't, I don't think it even has a working title yet.
[01:28:23.365 --> 01:28:30.329]  And so we're going to be going inside Eastern Europe, inside the United States with what's happening with the drug war.
[01:28:30.329 --> 01:28:32.610]  This thing is so multifaceted.
[01:28:32.610 --> 01:28:50.141]  But I find it interesting that George Soros has been pushing for marijuana decriminalization, which I support because I'm against the police state and the drug war, but that it's also then connected in to political operations in Eastern Europe and the whole fight against who will control those former satellites of the Soviet Union.
[01:28:50.141 --> 01:28:52.202]  So it gets very opaque.
[01:28:52.782 --> 01:28:59.904]  When you really break it all down, we're going to try to drill into it with folks with different angles and different perspectives straight ahead.

[01:29:17.589 --> 01:29:21.710]  It's like a three-year-old video on there, but InfoWars.com forward slash

[01:29:37.562 --> 01:29:41.145]  You go watch the informational videos about a gallbladder liver cleanse.
[01:29:41.145 --> 01:29:42.946]  Almost everybody has dramatic results.
[01:29:42.946 --> 01:29:46.469]  Read the five-star reviews at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:29:48.018 --> 01:29:51.959]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.959 --> 01:29:58.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:05.002]  Putin has reportedly threatened to launch tactical nukes at Turkey if the ISIS-supporting country invades Syria with Saudi Arabia.
[01:30:05.002 --> 01:30:09.423]  The Russians have about 20,000 troops in Syria helping the Syrian government fight ISIS.
[01:30:09.423 --> 01:30:15.724]  And Putin warned the Turkish president that Moscow's prepared to use tactical nuclear weapons to protect its troops if Turkey attacks.
[01:30:16.224 --> 01:30:26.447]  Since Turkey is part of NATO, any such conflict could quickly escalate into a full-scale nuclear confrontation, said award-winning Iran-Contra journalist Robert Perry, who was tipped off about the warning.
[01:30:26.447 --> 01:30:35.030]  Moscow's apparent threat to repel a Turkish invasion of Syria with nukes follows a warning by the Russian Prime Minister that another world war will erupt if the U.S.
[01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:37.451]  and its allies send ground troops into Syria.
[01:30:37.451 --> 01:30:43.753]  And if Syria falls, Russia will be geopolitically isolated from the rest of the world, which is exactly what the globalists want.
[01:30:44.073 --> 01:30:46.814]  So they can easily hijack and control the country.
[01:30:46.814 --> 01:30:55.779]  And further adding to the threat of world war, Saudi Arabia is currently staging the biggest war game the region has seen in 25 years, according to Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:30:55.779 --> 01:30:57.100]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[01:30:58.670 --> 01:31:05.874]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[01:31:51.704 --> 01:31:54.265]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:31:54.265 --> 01:31:55.686]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:31:55.686 --> 01:31:57.267]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:31:57.267 --> 01:31:58.827]  I feel like I look better.
[01:31:58.827 --> 01:31:59.388]  I feel better.
[01:31:59.388 --> 01:32:00.088]  I feel sexier.
[01:32:00.088 --> 01:32:00.468]  I love it.

[01:32:26.677 --> 01:32:28.077]  This is life-changing.
[01:32:28.077 --> 01:32:30.718]  Shower filters, we're introducing the best yet.
[01:32:30.718 --> 01:32:34.779]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[01:32:34.779 --> 01:32:39.600]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:41.760]  This new four-stage filtration process
[01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:42.220]  Is the U.S.
[01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:47.164]  involved with any procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons, buying, selling, anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey out of Libya?
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:15.642]  To Turkey?
[01:33:15.642 --> 01:33:17.063]  It is a big idea.
[01:33:17.063 --> 01:33:19.705]  A new world order.
[01:33:19.705 --> 01:33:23.448]  How is it that this organization is so well-funded, so organized?
[01:33:23.448 --> 01:33:30.874]  Islamic State-linked militants have gained a stronger foothold in Libya, seizing new economically vital areas of the country.
[01:33:30.874 --> 01:33:38.921]  The leader of ISIS in Libya is none other than Abdel Hakim al-Hajj, and of course he was armed to the teeth by NATO.
[01:33:39.201 --> 01:33:43.403]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[01:33:43.403 --> 01:33:47.926]  The Russians say they're negotiating with North Korea to hold joint military exercises.
[01:33:47.926 --> 01:33:54.389]  Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin teaming up, creating an ominous alliance against the United States.
[01:33:54.389 --> 01:33:59.352]  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is aggressively opposing the nuclear deal that the U.S.
[01:33:59.352 --> 01:34:01.693]  government is negotiating with Iran.
[01:34:01.693 --> 01:34:06.816]  Saudi Arabia is apparently prepared to allow Israeli jets into its airspace to conduct attacks on Iran.
[01:34:07.356 --> 01:34:12.301]  We have an unprecedented opportunity to build a new world order.
[01:34:12.301 --> 01:34:18.587]  I set up a foundation in Ukraine and played an important part in events now.
[01:34:18.587 --> 01:34:23.011]  Ukraine is set to receive the first tranche of an international monetary fund aid package.
[01:34:23.011 --> 01:34:27.736]  We had brokered a deal to transition power in Ukraine.
[01:34:27.736 --> 01:34:29.518]  Vladimir Putin is on the move.
[01:34:31.844 --> 01:34:42.593]  Only when this transformation is complete will we be able to take full measure of the opportunities presented by this new and involving world order.
[01:34:42.593 --> 01:34:45.735]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:34:45.735 --> 01:34:47.917]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:35:01.932 --> 01:35:04.933]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:35:04.933 --> 01:35:06.193]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:35:06.193 --> 01:35:08.334]  Now, we've got a whole building full of guests today.
[01:35:08.334 --> 01:35:13.675]  We've got another guest coming in to join us as well, or at least from the control room, in the next hour.
[01:35:13.675 --> 01:35:18.736]  We've also got Kevin Booth, one of my good friends, known Kevin for 21 years, Kevin.
[01:35:20.757 --> 01:35:23.699]  Kevin was there when I decided to change over from being Bill Hicks.
[01:35:23.699 --> 01:35:27.582]  Let's go ahead and turn Kevin's mic on.
[01:35:27.582 --> 01:35:28.482]  That's funny.
[01:35:28.482 --> 01:35:29.663]  That's the ongoing joke.
[01:35:29.663 --> 01:35:30.884]  There's so many of those videos.
[01:35:30.884 --> 01:35:50.257]  Kevin, you were trying to explain this to me about a year ago, and then when you came to visit for Christmas and we're over at the house with the family, because you are family, and I spent a lot of Christmases with your mom and dad before they passed, but you and your wife Trey were back in town from Hollywood, and you were trying to explain this to me, and I got it, but it was so amazingly complex, I said, this is gonna be a great film.
[01:35:51.157 --> 01:35:51.478]  I don't know.
[01:36:08.989 --> 01:36:16.434]  I've had a few drinks with, God rest their souls, great people, and then it turned into a drug war film because he was exposing that.
[01:36:16.434 --> 01:36:21.958]  So talk about a true fly on the wall, that's kind of how you do it, and it took him 65 years to make a film.
[01:36:21.958 --> 01:36:29.224]  So why don't you introduce Big Mike to everybody, tell us who he is, his background, and then you kind of take over this segment.
[01:36:29.904 --> 01:36:50.316]  Because where do we begin with the guy with the biggest hemp and marijuana growing factory system and nutrient system in the world and can tell us about multinational connections and or how you got into Eastern European elections and the Russians and then you guys found Al-Qaeda training camps.
[01:36:50.916 --> 01:36:53.737]  You told me this a year ago, now that's actually in the news.
[01:36:53.737 --> 01:36:55.458]  So wild stuff that you've discovered.
[01:36:55.458 --> 01:36:58.759]  I've seen some of the footage, Kevin, and it's something out of a James Bond movie.
[01:36:58.759 --> 01:37:00.239]  I mean, really scary.
[01:37:00.239 --> 01:37:04.361]  This is not stuff you see on Discovery Channel or History Channel or even Vice.
[01:37:04.361 --> 01:37:05.701]  So I can't wait to see the film.
[01:37:05.701 --> 01:37:09.002]  And I just want to say, don't take another three years to put it out.
[01:37:09.002 --> 01:37:10.102]  Just hurry up and do it.
[01:37:10.102 --> 01:37:11.323]  So that's my rant.
[01:37:11.323 --> 01:37:12.243]  Thanks for coming in, guys.
[01:37:12.243 --> 01:37:14.484]  I guess you guys flew in on your private jet, Big Mike.
[01:37:14.484 --> 01:37:17.285]  Tell us specifically where we should start this story, Kevin.
[01:37:17.864 --> 01:37:22.128]  Well, I'd like to start with just introducing Big Mike, and we've known each other for many years.
[01:37:22.128 --> 01:37:37.742]  He's actually helped with financing some of my other projects in the past, and I was coming to him to work on another marijuana documentary, and he said, uh, I've got this other thing that I want to point you towards in the meantime, and it's Bulgaria.
[01:37:37.742 --> 01:37:40.825]  And of course my response was, you know, I thought he was out of his mind.
[01:37:41.604 --> 01:37:45.928]  Next thing you know it, I'm in Bulgaria, and it's the weirdest place on earth.
[01:37:45.928 --> 01:37:49.772]  And I'm just going to give the mic over to Big Mike here to tell the story.
[01:37:49.772 --> 01:37:56.118]  But basically, you know, he has a company, Advanced Nutrients, the biggest company on the globe that makes it.
[01:37:56.118 --> 01:37:57.079]  They don't make marijuana.
[01:37:57.079 --> 01:38:03.425]  They make everything you need to grow the finest, cleanest cannabis there is, you know, working to make it a clean, safe medicine.
[01:38:04.130 --> 01:38:10.195]  Mike moved a research section of his company there, and that's when he fell into all these things.
[01:38:10.195 --> 01:38:11.096]  Right.
[01:38:11.096 --> 01:38:19.924]  So, I heard the Bulgarian Academy of Science was laying off some really bright scientists, so I said, let's go over there and see what's going on there.
[01:38:19.924 --> 01:38:21.926]  Did you have a previous connection to Bulgaria?
[01:38:21.926 --> 01:38:22.006]  No.
[01:38:23.166 --> 01:38:24.387]  And so, went over there.
[01:38:24.387 --> 01:38:31.473]  We were also able to obtain a license to legally research cannabis there.
[01:38:31.473 --> 01:38:33.035]  And we had it for the last nine years.
[01:38:33.035 --> 01:38:37.899]  We're allowed to keep one kilo of product for research purposes.
[01:38:37.899 --> 01:38:39.200]  All the rest we have to burn and destroy.
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:42.903]  There's cameras in there, go straight to the police stations, the whole bit.
[01:38:42.903 --> 01:38:47.587]  And so, because of that, and I'm involved there, I'm going there.
[01:38:47.587 --> 01:38:48.508]  One Christmas I said,
[01:38:49.764 --> 01:38:52.126]  I want to donate some money and help these people.
[01:38:52.126 --> 01:38:53.767]  And they said, well, you can't do that.
[01:38:53.767 --> 01:38:54.648]  I go, well, why?
[01:38:54.648 --> 01:38:55.689]  They go, well, there's no charity.
[01:38:55.689 --> 01:38:57.330]  I go, wait, wait, hang on.
[01:38:57.330 --> 01:38:58.190]  This was three years ago.
[01:38:58.190 --> 01:39:00.812]  This wasn't like, you know, 20, 30 years ago.
[01:39:00.812 --> 01:39:03.134]  There's no charity where I can donate money and feed people.
[01:39:03.134 --> 01:39:03.975]  They go, no.
[01:39:03.975 --> 01:39:05.836]  I go, okay, we're going to start one.
[01:39:05.836 --> 01:39:08.138]  And they looked at me like I was out of my mind.
[01:39:08.138 --> 01:39:09.239]  Like, out of my mind.
[01:39:09.239 --> 01:39:10.340]  They said, you can't do that here.
[01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:10.980]  You don't understand.
[01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:12.021]  This is Bulgaria.
[01:39:12.021 --> 01:39:13.042]  You're wasting your time.
[01:39:13.042 --> 01:39:15.143]  Don't bother doing it.
[01:39:15.143 --> 01:39:15.864]  We're different.
[01:39:16.716 --> 01:39:21.078]  Of course, I'm American, and so we just don't roll that way, do we?
[01:39:21.078 --> 01:39:23.599]  And I just said, no, we're going to do it.
[01:39:23.599 --> 01:39:29.822]  So from the inception to the last family that was fed was exactly three weeks, 21 days.
[01:39:29.822 --> 01:39:31.703]  They were like, how'd you get it done so fast?
[01:39:31.703 --> 01:39:34.284]  We just set our minds to it, and we got it done.
[01:39:34.284 --> 01:39:36.125]  Now it's a big charity there.
[01:39:36.125 --> 01:39:37.906]  We have celebrities.
[01:39:37.906 --> 01:39:39.947]  Last Christmas we got done feeding 26,000 needy Bulgarians.
[01:39:42.972 --> 01:39:46.055]  I was wondering, like, how the hell do I get all this resistance?
[01:39:46.055 --> 01:39:47.316]  Like, what's happening here?
[01:39:47.316 --> 01:39:48.958]  Why is everyone like this?
[01:39:48.958 --> 01:39:51.560]  And why is their mindset the way it is?
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:54.323]  And I started peeling back the layers of the onion.
[01:39:54.323 --> 01:40:03.712]  And lo and behold, there was this corrupt government that was just out of control, stealing billions of dollars from the people with no foreign policy.
[01:40:05.223 --> 01:40:19.749]  And as I started digging deeper and deeper, I saw there's a Putin connection, you have Russia, literally, people have to understand, Bulgaria is an EU country and a member of NATO.
[01:40:20.805 --> 01:40:29.089]  And here, the top officials are taking bribes directly from Russia, from Putin, against the interests of the West.
[01:40:29.089 --> 01:40:34.732]  If you say, I'm an EU country, if you say you're with NATO, then you're with the West.
[01:40:34.732 --> 01:40:37.233]  And clearly, that hasn't happened there.
[01:40:37.233 --> 01:40:43.316]  And you have all this money coming in from Russia, swaying the opinions of what has to go on.
[01:40:43.316 --> 01:40:47.719]  And these same leaders, turns out, they have a big cigarette tax scam going.
[01:40:48.667 --> 01:40:51.592]  And they're giving money to ISIS.
[01:40:51.592 --> 01:40:58.443]  And now we have very good information that there's an ISIS training camp in the mountains of Bulgaria.
[01:40:59.611 --> 01:41:00.972]  No one is paying attention.
[01:41:00.972 --> 01:41:03.795]  Now, are the Russians connected to the ISIS training camps?
[01:41:03.795 --> 01:41:16.546]  Just to give a little bit of a historical background, people need to know, because a lot of people don't know the history of Bulgaria, that during World War II... By the way, you've shown me, when you came to visit at Christmas, a lot of footage at my house.
[01:41:16.546 --> 01:41:18.307]  I mean, it is amazing the stuff you've got.
[01:41:18.307 --> 01:41:25.253]  I mean, it makes stuff like out of Mexico and their drug war stuff look... I mean, it's like a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:41:25.333 --> 01:41:31.076]  Well, people need to understand that Bulgaria had a German king during World War II.
[01:41:31.076 --> 01:41:32.717]  Because of that, the Nazis didn't invade.
[01:41:32.717 --> 01:41:37.199]  But then what happened was, when Germany lost the war, the Russians basically claimed it as their own.
[01:41:37.199 --> 01:41:40.781]  And so, Bulgaria became the People's Republic of Bulgaria for 45 years.
[01:41:41.881 --> 01:41:47.563]  So, Russia basically, the Soviet Union, controlled Bulgaria for 45 solid years.
[01:41:47.563 --> 01:41:54.226]  So you have all these people, when you go there now, it's like rats living in a maze, but the maze has been picked up, but they don't know that the maze has been picked up.
[01:41:54.226 --> 01:41:56.267]  Ooh, that's a great allegory.
[01:41:56.267 --> 01:41:57.327]  Did you invent that one?
[01:41:57.327 --> 01:41:57.887]  That's really good.
[01:41:57.887 --> 01:42:02.729]  Well, I did now, and I'm going to trademark that real good.
[01:42:02.729 --> 01:42:05.690]  And we bring your wife in here too, at a certain point.
[01:42:05.690 --> 01:42:08.031]  Anyways, Kevin, you guys look a little bit better than you.
[01:42:09.574 --> 01:42:13.076]  You look better than me, so... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:42:13.076 --> 01:42:21.960]  So, basically what happened was when communism fell, the KGB put mafia, their mafia, in place of the government.
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:24.522]  And so you had a... They call it a stay-behind network.
[01:42:24.522 --> 01:42:25.662]  Yeah, basically.
[01:42:25.662 --> 01:42:27.964]  And so that's the government that's really still there today.
[01:42:27.964 --> 01:42:33.166]  And the people there have the mindset that they're still living under communism.
[01:42:33.166 --> 01:42:38.449]  In fact, a lot of the old people still look at communism as the good old days, because at least they didn't have to worry about a roof over their head.
[01:42:38.729 --> 01:42:39.589]  Well, here's my issue.
[01:42:39.589 --> 01:42:51.612]  When you were first, a few years ago, talking to Big Mike and stuff, and I looked up Big Mike, because I'm not an expert on him, but things like, wow, this guy is the kingpin of all these high-quality products for folks, and is trying to help a lot of charities around the world, Africa, you name it.
[01:42:51.612 --> 01:42:52.772]  And I'm all for decriminalization.
[01:42:52.772 --> 01:42:59.973]  I know it has a lot of great uses, but I'm not in the total camp where it's the Messiah, and it's God, and let's give it to kids or whatever, because some people end up in their mom's basement.
[01:42:59.973 --> 01:43:03.154]  Of course, they'll be in their mom's basement anyways, but at least they're going to be stoned, I guess.
[01:43:03.154 --> 01:43:07.515]  So I guess we already have the proclivity to be a bum, like Bernie Sanders, who didn't work until he was 40.
[01:43:08.215 --> 01:43:08.756]  I don't think so.
[01:43:23.092 --> 01:43:24.173]  Former KGB.
[01:43:24.173 --> 01:43:25.874]  That's how it works.
[01:43:25.874 --> 01:43:30.256]  At the same time, I know our government runs more narcotics than Russia does.
[01:43:30.256 --> 01:43:30.696]  Sure.
[01:43:30.696 --> 01:43:32.497]  And pays everybody off as well.
[01:43:32.497 --> 01:43:39.301]  And so my issue is, the Russians aren't in Mexico trying to manipulate foreign policy through that.
[01:43:39.301 --> 01:43:43.864]  We are there in Eastern Europe, which I get.
[01:43:43.864 --> 01:43:44.665]  It's a vacuum.
[01:43:44.665 --> 01:43:50.788]  But George Soros, the weirdo Nazi collaborator showing up, is not the liberator.
[01:43:52.609 --> 01:44:00.835]  And so my problem is, I just see the West and the East wanting to make money off conflict and wars in the areas, but you've lived there, you've worked there, you've been there a bunch.
[01:44:00.835 --> 01:44:02.496]  I will defer to you guys.
[01:44:02.496 --> 01:44:07.680]  Kevin, Big Mike, who do you think the bad guys really are in this?
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:07.941]  Putin.
[01:44:07.941 --> 01:44:09.982]  A thousand percent.
[01:44:09.982 --> 01:44:10.583]  It's the Russians.
[01:44:10.583 --> 01:44:21.611]  Look, before the World War II, Bulgaria was the third wealthiest nation in Europe.
[01:44:22.446 --> 01:44:23.768]  It was one of the major banking centers.
[01:44:23.768 --> 01:44:25.592]  They were wildly successful.
[01:44:25.592 --> 01:44:33.165]  Then communism came for 50 years, followed by 25 more years of so-called democracy, but it was the same guys using the same techniques.
[01:44:34.352 --> 01:44:40.215]  An ideology, and now we are in the situation that we're in.
[01:44:40.215 --> 01:44:52.180]  So, and Russia has this huge, huge influence over them, and yet they're an EU country, they're a NATO country, you know, we need to do something about it.
[01:44:52.180 --> 01:44:55.102]  We need to get in there and we need to stop it now.
[01:44:55.102 --> 01:44:55.982]  So you agree with George Soros?
[01:44:59.031 --> 01:45:00.892]  Look, I'm not a politician.
[01:45:00.892 --> 01:45:02.133]  I'm not a political person.
[01:45:02.133 --> 01:45:04.215]  Like, you're a pundit on that.
[01:45:04.215 --> 01:45:05.515]  I'm just a business guy.
[01:45:05.515 --> 01:45:06.556]  No, no, no.
[01:45:06.556 --> 01:45:07.057]  I get it.
[01:45:07.057 --> 01:45:09.118]  You just have a business.
[01:45:09.118 --> 01:45:11.039]  You just tell it like you see it.
[01:45:11.039 --> 01:45:13.741]  And I agree with your perspective from your perspective.
[01:45:13.741 --> 01:45:18.945]  What I'm saying here is, you're certainly in the business you're involved in, aware of what Soros is up to.
[01:45:18.945 --> 01:45:19.845]  Have you ever met Soros?
[01:45:19.845 --> 01:45:20.766]  No, never have.
[01:45:20.766 --> 01:45:21.686]  It's okay if you have.
[01:45:21.686 --> 01:45:24.228]  No, I wouldn't care if I didn't.
[01:45:24.228 --> 01:45:24.829]  I still have him on.
[01:45:24.829 --> 01:45:25.129]  Sure, sure.
[01:45:25.729 --> 01:45:30.053]  Soros was involved in the legalization process of cannabis early on.
[01:45:30.053 --> 01:45:32.135]  So far I haven't seen his name thrown around anywhere.
[01:45:32.135 --> 01:45:34.196]  Why do you think he was?
[01:45:34.196 --> 01:45:36.218]  I have no idea, but I'm glad somebody did.
[01:45:36.218 --> 01:45:41.282]  I'm glad there was three billionaires actually that got together and really started pushing this.
[01:45:41.282 --> 01:45:44.145]  And now the marijuana policy... So Soros kind of opened the door up for you?
[01:45:44.145 --> 01:45:48.549]  Well yeah, they opened the door for cannabis in the country.
[01:45:50.836 --> 01:45:52.557]  As far as I'm concerned, cannabis should be legal.
[01:45:52.557 --> 01:45:55.459]  So instead of saying Hail Mary's, you say Hail Sorrows?
[01:45:55.459 --> 01:45:55.619]  No!
[01:45:55.619 --> 01:45:56.860]  I don't even care about that.
[01:45:56.860 --> 01:46:05.425]  What I care about is the outcome and the end result, and that is medical marijuana becomes available to the people of America as well as
[01:46:06.105 --> 01:46:08.527]  Legalization for recreational use.
[01:46:08.527 --> 01:46:09.848]  I want to see both of that.
[01:46:09.848 --> 01:46:11.070]  We're just wasting our time.
[01:46:11.070 --> 01:46:13.572]  We're wasting our money, our resources.
[01:46:13.572 --> 01:46:16.294]  I mean, we have an industrial prison complex that you're well aware of.
[01:46:16.294 --> 01:46:18.036]  You know, I've heard you talk about that.
[01:46:18.036 --> 01:46:18.876]  I agree about that.
[01:46:18.876 --> 01:46:20.458]  We do have that.
[01:46:20.458 --> 01:46:22.119]  And they needed to fill the jails.
[01:46:22.119 --> 01:46:23.400]  Well, now that cannabis is
[01:46:24.531 --> 01:46:27.413]  Now, medical cannabis, that's changing.
[01:46:27.413 --> 01:46:33.918]  I've talked to people in the prison complex, and they said they're letting the marijuana people out, and they're bringing real criminals in.
[01:46:33.918 --> 01:46:35.099]  Sure, what do you think of Obama?
[01:46:35.099 --> 01:46:42.765]  Because one thing I was hoping with him is, I am for decriminalization, and then all these states legalized it for medical use.
[01:46:42.765 --> 01:46:44.886]  We don't want to have people that smoke pot in prison.
[01:46:44.886 --> 01:46:46.788]  It does have a lot of medical uses, that's admitted.
[01:46:46.788 --> 01:46:49.390]  It's really a miracle drug.
[01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:52.012]  Medicine, as Kevin was saying, I don't think that's debatable.
[01:46:52.552 --> 01:46:56.214]  And then it just seems like I've seen more federal raids, more federal harassment.
[01:46:56.214 --> 01:47:00.477]  Have you, in the last eight years under Obama, experienced more or less pressure?
[01:47:00.477 --> 01:47:04.419]  Because you're just trying to supply folks for industrial hemp, no THC, or for the other.
[01:47:04.419 --> 01:47:08.882]  I mean, you should be allowed to sell the lights and the equipment and the nutrients for the plants.
[01:47:08.882 --> 01:47:09.802]  Yeah, we sell the nutrients.
[01:47:09.802 --> 01:47:10.803]  The electrolytes plants, Craig?
[01:47:13.112 --> 01:47:17.994]  So, um, no, like a long time ago there was a lot of pressure.
[01:47:17.994 --> 01:47:20.814]  It's becoming less and less and less pressure.
[01:47:20.814 --> 01:47:30.257]  Now, there are instances where they're using, like they went up to Northern California just recently and they busted a bunch of people over water rights, right?
[01:47:30.257 --> 01:47:34.938]  I mean, what I look at is the government, the DEA, they're in their death throes.
[01:47:34.938 --> 01:47:38.639]  They know that this thing is coming to an end and it's coming very, very quickly.
[01:47:38.639 --> 01:47:40.240]  You're right, so they're moving into other rackets.
[01:47:40.882 --> 01:47:42.043]  Well, yeah.
[01:47:42.043 --> 01:47:42.743]  Apparently so.
[01:47:42.743 --> 01:47:44.024]  And I'm glad they're out of ours.
[01:47:44.024 --> 01:47:44.904]  And they need to stay out.
[01:47:44.904 --> 01:47:48.186]  And they need people and should allow people to heal themselves.
[01:47:48.186 --> 01:47:50.007]  Well, you know, that's what happened on record.
[01:47:50.007 --> 01:47:52.329]  They made alcohol illegal for 10 years.
[01:47:52.329 --> 01:47:55.110]  It crippled the size of organized crime, corrupted the police.
[01:47:55.110 --> 01:47:55.831]  And when that ended...
[01:47:56.491 --> 01:47:57.251]  They had to have something new.
[01:47:57.251 --> 01:47:59.653]  They actually said, we've got to make marijuana illegal.
[01:47:59.653 --> 01:48:00.813]  No one knew what it was.
[01:48:00.813 --> 01:48:03.454]  It's only smoked in the Southwest and stuff.
[01:48:03.454 --> 01:48:07.676]  And so they were able to get it illegal by making reefer madness, where you smoke pot and murder everybody.
[01:48:07.676 --> 01:48:09.397]  It's the opposite.
[01:48:09.397 --> 01:48:11.578]  That's Zoloft that does that, folks.
[01:48:11.578 --> 01:48:15.780]  And then they were able to ban it, so they had something new to sell.
[01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:21.043]  And then once it was banned, then the police departments and others in the big cities rolled it out to the public.
[01:48:21.483 --> 01:48:21.883]  Right.
[01:48:21.883 --> 01:48:24.025]  Well, you can thank, you know, DuPont for that.
[01:48:24.025 --> 01:48:26.987]  In 1937, they hired some lobbyists and got the laws changed.
[01:48:26.987 --> 01:48:28.328]  Before that, it was legal.
[01:48:28.328 --> 01:48:29.389]  And why did DuPont do that?
[01:48:29.389 --> 01:48:30.410]  They want to shut down hemp.
[01:48:30.410 --> 01:48:31.510]  Well, no, yeah, exactly.
[01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:32.251]  Tell us about that.
[01:48:32.251 --> 01:48:32.731]  Exactly.
[01:48:32.731 --> 01:48:35.834]  Because they want to shut down hemp because they don't have a chemical to break it down.
[01:48:35.834 --> 01:48:39.777]  But they had a chemical called sulfuric acid that was great for cotton.
[01:48:39.777 --> 01:48:43.559]  And so they said, hey, the cotton industry's got to- That was another angler-ish.
[01:48:43.559 --> 01:48:44.220]  Right.
[01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:46.742]  And hemp, you know, we're going to put that to the wayside.
[01:48:47.262 --> 01:48:49.244]  In fact, you just gave the other part of the equation.
[01:48:49.244 --> 01:48:49.664]  Exactly.
[01:48:49.664 --> 01:48:52.767]  DuPont came in and others and said, we don't like hemp.
[01:48:52.767 --> 01:48:53.487]  You can grow it anywhere.
[01:48:53.487 --> 01:48:54.869]  It's better than cotton.
[01:48:54.869 --> 01:48:56.870]  The Constitution's written on hemp paper.
[01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:57.931]  That's correct.
[01:48:57.931 --> 01:49:03.997]  You know what I love is these brainwashed people that go, I can't believe you're into peddling marijuana now, Alex.
[01:49:03.997 --> 01:49:08.781]  I saw in your magazine, you know, advertisements to decriminalize marijuana in Texas.
[01:49:08.781 --> 01:49:09.882]  I can't believe it.
[01:49:09.882 --> 01:49:11.163]  Even some distant family.
[01:49:11.163 --> 01:49:12.704]  We're ashamed of you.
[01:49:12.704 --> 01:49:14.425]  And I'm like, do you understand
[01:49:15.206 --> 01:49:24.273]  That this was an ad for hemp that has no THC and all of our rope and sails and clothes was made out of it because it's superior to cotton.
[01:49:24.273 --> 01:49:25.974]  Do you understand that?
[01:49:25.974 --> 01:49:28.396]  I just don't like a pothead in the family.
[01:49:28.396 --> 01:49:29.797]  And that you just can't get through to them.
[01:49:30.137 --> 01:49:39.364]  Well I think something to bring up too is the fact that our own Department of Health took out a patent or got the patent for cannabinoids in 2003.
[01:49:39.364 --> 01:49:42.106]  So that's a pretty interesting thing.
[01:49:42.106 --> 01:49:54.715]  So while the FDA is putting out press releases saying that marijuana has no medicinal benefits, our own Department of Health is basically trying to patent marijuana for its medicinal benefits.
[01:49:54.995 --> 01:50:07.406]  And they have Marinol, which has been proven doesn't work, a synthetic version of THC, which is a Category 3 drug, where marijuana, the whole plant, is a Category 1, along with heroin, LSD, and cocaine.
[01:50:07.406 --> 01:50:15.253]  Right, the pharmaceutical companies want to... Meanwhile, half the little kids I run into are on some form of speed, and you look at the molecule, it's like methamphetamine.
[01:50:15.353 --> 01:50:15.833]  No, it is.
[01:50:15.833 --> 01:50:18.476]  Oh yeah, it's an epidemic in this country.
[01:50:18.476 --> 01:50:19.176]  It's a huge epidemic.
[01:50:19.176 --> 01:50:21.798]  So it's okay, yeah, let's put the kids on methamphetamine.
[01:50:21.798 --> 01:50:26.262]  It makes their hearts expand, shrinks their brain, literally, but marijuana, throw the book at them.
[01:50:26.262 --> 01:50:28.524]  Yeah, that's the way it is.
[01:50:28.524 --> 01:50:40.893]  Big Mike, when we come back, and I want to work your guests, the political activists from Bulgaria in, I want to get your wife on, whoever else is interesting folks, this entourage of interesting, some look like professors, other people, you know, look like
[01:50:43.197 --> 01:50:44.978]  I don't know, commandos or something.
[01:50:44.978 --> 01:50:48.599]  Anyways, it's all coming up today with Kevin Booth and Big Mike.

[01:51:29.992 --> 01:51:31.453]  You've heard about bunkers.
[01:51:31.453 --> 01:51:34.196]  But surviving is not recreation.
[01:51:34.196 --> 01:51:36.960]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[01:51:59.597 --> 01:52:03.380]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:11.105]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:52:11.105 --> 01:52:19.731]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:52:19.731 --> 01:52:24.154]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:52:24.154 --> 01:52:29.297]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:52:29.737 --> 01:52:33.958]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:52:33.958 --> 01:52:37.379]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.

[01:53:24.789 --> 01:53:27.169]  From the Robert Allen System, current returns not indicative of future results.
[01:53:27.816 --> 01:53:30.858]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:53:30.858 --> 01:53:33.499]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:53:33.499 --> 01:53:34.239]  Croix River.
[01:53:34.239 --> 01:53:36.460]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:53:36.460 --> 01:53:39.442]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:53:39.442 --> 01:53:40.302]  His excuse?
[01:53:40.302 --> 01:53:41.643]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:53:41.643 --> 01:53:43.244]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:53:43.244 --> 01:53:49.007]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[01:54:23.852 --> 01:54:27.435]  Kelly Lazarchak, did I say that right?
[01:54:27.435 --> 01:54:28.656]  Is in here with Big Mike.
[01:54:28.656 --> 01:54:35.901]  And Big Mike was just telling me during the break, the reason he also knows what's happening with Russia and Eastern Europe is you yourself, you're saying, have an Estonian background?
[01:54:35.901 --> 01:54:36.442]  Yes.
[01:54:36.442 --> 01:54:38.583]  My mother was Estonian, my father was Latvian.
[01:54:38.583 --> 01:54:44.348]  All my life I grew up hearing the terrors of communism, you know, and what Russia did.
[01:54:44.348 --> 01:54:45.449]  I can remember asking my father,
[01:54:46.209 --> 01:54:51.915]  Dad, you know, will we ever be able to go back to our countries and see what's going on?
[01:54:51.915 --> 01:54:55.838]  I'd love to be able to see, like, where you grew up and went to school and all that stuff.
[01:54:55.838 --> 01:55:02.245]  He goes, son, you'll probably never... He goes, you might see it in your lifetime if you're lucky.
[01:55:03.625 --> 01:55:04.726]  He died before that happened.
[01:55:04.726 --> 01:55:07.128]  Oh, you're getting tears in your eyes.
[01:55:07.128 --> 01:55:08.249]  It's emotional, right?
[01:55:08.249 --> 01:55:10.652]  So, I have a bunch of relatives in Estonia.
[01:55:10.652 --> 01:55:12.053]  The wall comes down.
[01:55:12.053 --> 01:55:13.535]  We go to get reunited.
[01:55:13.535 --> 01:55:17.339]  If you can imagine, my mother's been separated for 54 years, right, from her family.
[01:55:17.339 --> 01:55:18.900]  Wow, that is emotional.
[01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:24.086]  We're reunited, and I see what it looks like.
[01:55:25.290 --> 01:55:29.195]  And then I kept going back, and it got better and better and better.
[01:55:29.195 --> 01:55:31.839]  And now Estonia is a great country.
[01:55:31.839 --> 01:55:34.482]  You know, good infrastructure, things work properly.
[01:55:34.482 --> 01:55:35.544]  And I'm in Bulgaria.
[01:55:35.544 --> 01:55:38.347]  So for you, you're pro-West, pro-EU.
[01:55:38.347 --> 01:55:41.572]  They may not be perfect, but you see countries under Russia still go to hell.
[01:55:41.912 --> 01:55:48.094]  Well, in this case, why did Estonia move themselves to greatness and Bulgaria didn't?
[01:55:48.094 --> 01:55:58.856]  And then when I dug down, it was because of the mindset, it was because of the leaders, it was because of just horrible, horrible corruption and just psychological abuse to the people of Bulgaria.
[01:55:58.856 --> 01:55:59.837]  And that's what they're doing.
[01:55:59.837 --> 01:56:04.118]  They're using the same exact mind control techniques that they used
[01:56:04.798 --> 01:56:08.959]  In communism, today, in a democratic society.
[01:56:08.959 --> 01:56:10.020]  And the people haven't realized.
[01:56:10.020 --> 01:56:11.940]  The analogy that you gave is perfect.
[01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:13.101]  They don't realize they're free.
[01:56:13.101 --> 01:56:14.921]  It's like the elephant who's got the chain.
[01:56:14.921 --> 01:56:16.242]  When they're a baby, they chain him down.
[01:56:16.242 --> 01:56:18.483]  He realizes he can't lift his foot up.
[01:56:18.483 --> 01:56:22.344]  When he's an adult, they just put the chain around him and he doesn't try to move because he thinks he can't.
[01:56:23.177 --> 01:56:23.897]  Same thing.
[01:56:23.897 --> 01:56:25.118]  Look, the West is involved.
[01:56:25.118 --> 01:56:28.861]  I mean, we're not saying the West isn't involved in Bulgaria.
[01:56:28.861 --> 01:56:34.184]  We've had times where we're trying to bring to the attention about ISIS to the American embassy over there.
[01:56:34.184 --> 01:56:37.726]  The American embassy refuses to talk to us in Bulgaria.
[01:56:37.726 --> 01:56:42.229]  And so there's definitely, I mean, John Kerry's been coming over there doing energy deals.
[01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:43.910]  So there's a lot.
[01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:47.152]  I mean, we're not saying the West isn't coming to Bulgaria.
[01:56:47.312 --> 01:56:48.532]  Well sure, I mean, look at Ukraine.
[01:56:48.532 --> 01:56:51.653]  I mean, the Russians have done horrible things, especially in the Soviet Union to Ukraine.
[01:56:51.653 --> 01:56:53.093]  But the Nazis did bad stuff as well.
[01:56:53.093 --> 01:56:54.794]  I mean, it's all just a circus.
[01:56:54.794 --> 01:57:00.015]  And then you've got Joe Biden's son coming in and getting the energy deal for all the gas in the country.
[01:57:00.015 --> 01:57:00.535]  Yeah.
[01:57:00.535 --> 01:57:06.877]  I mean, it just sounds like, it sounds like we're getting more corrupt and then Russia basically is the way it's always been.
[01:57:06.877 --> 01:57:08.037]  Or what's the word there?
[01:57:08.037 --> 01:57:11.518]  Is Russia worse than it used to be or is it better or the same?
[01:57:12.438 --> 01:57:16.579]  Russia's there, like we have our interests, they have their interests.
[01:57:16.579 --> 01:57:21.600]  Clearly though, you're a member of the EU, you're a member of NATO, you back the West.
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:22.720]  That's what they wanted.
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:35.343]  We have a military base there, an Air Force base in Bulgaria, and you need to back the House, and the House is the West, and they're not doing that.
[01:57:35.343 --> 01:57:37.164]  They have, let's give you an instance.
[01:57:39.890 --> 01:57:47.634]  America has something called TRUCA, and that is our pipeline that we want to put through there.
[01:57:47.634 --> 01:57:49.534]  Russia has SOUTHSTREAM.
[01:57:49.534 --> 01:57:50.895]  They want to put that through.
[01:57:50.895 --> 01:57:55.117]  Shell wants to go off the Black Sea and drill for oil.
[01:57:55.117 --> 01:57:57.238]  And now that's being blocked.
[01:57:57.238 --> 01:57:57.978]  So what does Russia do?
[01:57:57.978 --> 01:58:01.020]  They hire a PR company in Bulgaria, gave them $20 million.
[01:58:03.393 --> 01:58:08.555]  To go and say, hey, this is bad, we don't want this, you know, all the things.
[01:58:08.555 --> 01:58:13.378]  So, there's this fight between Westinghouse is there, wanting to build a nuclear power plant.
[01:58:13.378 --> 01:58:15.038]  No, we don't want that.
[01:58:15.038 --> 01:58:20.741]  And then, well, okay, but, however, you would then have Russia wanting to build a nuclear power plant.
[01:58:20.741 --> 01:58:21.582]  Well, that's even worse.
[01:58:21.582 --> 01:58:22.202]  That's right.
[01:58:22.202 --> 01:58:23.863]  Like, who are you going to trust more?
[01:58:23.863 --> 01:58:26.724]  Like, I trust us way more than I trust Russia.
[01:58:26.724 --> 01:58:28.225]  And you sure don't want to go electric.
[01:58:28.965 --> 01:58:29.646]  There you go.
[01:58:29.646 --> 01:58:32.528]  Be sure to build it on a fault line, though, in a tsunami zone.
[01:58:32.528 --> 01:58:35.630]  We're going to come right back and talk about World War III.
[01:58:35.630 --> 01:58:38.752]  The Russians are threatening to use nukes right now in Syria.
[01:58:38.752 --> 01:58:40.693]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:40.693 --> 01:58:44.136]  We're going to have a Putin-bashing fest, the likes of which you've never heard.
[01:58:44.136 --> 01:58:44.716]  I'm just joking.
[01:58:44.716 --> 01:58:45.977]  We're going to go to the drug war.
[01:58:45.977 --> 01:58:47.038]  Take your calls.
[01:58:47.038 --> 01:58:47.658]  I have an idea.
[01:58:47.658 --> 01:58:48.059]  Stay with us.
[01:58:48.604 --> 01:58:49.525]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:58:49.525 --> 01:58:50.105]  Good, brother.
[01:58:50.105 --> 01:58:52.047]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:58:52.047 --> 01:58:53.768]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:58:53.768 --> 01:58:57.791]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:58:57.791 --> 01:59:00.414]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:59:00.414 --> 01:59:02.836]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:59:02.836 --> 01:59:10.802]  SuperMill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:59:11.002 --> 01:59:14.247]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:59:14.247 --> 01:59:15.789]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:59:15.789 --> 01:59:18.734]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:59:18.734 --> 01:59:20.476]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:59:20.476 --> 01:59:26.285]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated.
[01:59:26.865 --> 01:59:29.147]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:13.226 --> 02:00:15.853]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:15.853 --> 02:00:20.847]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:24.835 --> 02:00:29.440]  Here's my bottom line on Russia, and then I want to segue into the current news and get your take, Big Mike.
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:32.984]  And again, Big Mike owns the $4 billion company Advanced Nutrients.
[02:00:32.984 --> 02:00:42.415]  AdvancedNutrients.com, HolidayHeroes.bg, forward slash EN is their charity, Facebook.com, forward slash BG, political change now.
[02:00:42.415 --> 02:00:44.277]  And I want to get into the film you're making, Kevin.
[02:00:44.277 --> 02:00:45.238]  I want to talk about all this.
[02:00:46.439 --> 02:00:48.141]  What is it like for your girlfriend?
[02:00:48.141 --> 02:00:49.842]  Because I know she's seen a lot of this.
[02:00:49.842 --> 02:00:54.465]  Kelly, just as an observer to this, you were saying you're not really political.
[02:00:54.465 --> 02:01:00.008]  What do you take away from the whole state of the world and what's happening with the drug war and what's happening in Eastern Europe and all of it?
[02:01:04.235 --> 02:01:06.436]  You can talk about your time in Bulgaria just now.
[02:01:06.436 --> 02:01:09.177]  It was very shocking, very emotional.
[02:01:09.177 --> 02:01:09.858]  Very emotional.
[02:01:09.858 --> 02:01:12.839]  I didn't know how I was going to take it.
[02:01:12.839 --> 02:01:17.081]  You know, I got there the first couple of days and I kind of freaked out.
[02:01:17.081 --> 02:01:18.422]  It was really emotional.
[02:01:18.422 --> 02:01:19.923]  You should have been with a security team before.
[02:01:20.663 --> 02:01:23.765]  Yeah, so it was really different.
[02:01:23.765 --> 02:01:43.961]  But once I kind of got, you know, was able to grasp that, just the more we were out in the cities and, you know, we went out and we, you know, did our charity and everything, my emotions just kind of took over me, just seeing how the country is and how the people are, and very heavy on my heart, you know?
[02:01:43.961 --> 02:01:46.543]  And I would imagine both of you have traveled a lot of countries before.
[02:01:47.887 --> 02:01:49.708]  Starting to, yeah.
[02:01:49.708 --> 02:01:53.869]  Would you say Bulgaria is one of the worst off places you've seen, Big Mike?
[02:01:53.869 --> 02:01:56.371]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:01:56.371 --> 02:02:01.092]  I mean, I was in India, I had an office there for seven years, and when you go back to Bulgaria, you go, well, it's a little bit better, right?
[02:02:01.092 --> 02:02:03.073]  But, I mean, it's bad.
[02:02:03.073 --> 02:02:06.755]  Of all the EU countries in Europe, it's by far the worst.
[02:02:06.755 --> 02:02:07.075]  The worst.
[02:02:08.672 --> 02:02:09.512]  Wow, Kevin?
[02:02:09.512 --> 02:02:18.634]  The Russians, I mean, one of the first things I noticed when I first flew into Bulgaria that I wasn't expecting is just the view of thousands of these Russian-looking tenement buildings.
[02:02:18.634 --> 02:02:32.396]  And so you picture this place that was once this beautiful European nation, and I think it was just all in the 80s that they built just all these concrete ghettos, and now all the people are forced to live in them.
[02:02:32.396 --> 02:02:34.337]  I mean, you'll see a lot of these buildings in the movies.
[02:02:34.337 --> 02:02:35.697]  They don't even have windows.
[02:02:37.167 --> 02:02:38.248]  Yeah, these people live in Cuba.
[02:02:38.248 --> 02:02:40.369]  Well, I mean, Bernie Sanders wants communism.
[02:02:40.369 --> 02:02:44.312]  I mean, that's a wonderland where all the 40-year-old bums can live.
[02:02:44.312 --> 02:02:46.193]  Imagine a nation run by 40-year-old bums.
[02:02:48.530 --> 02:02:50.912]  Clearly communism doesn't work.
[02:02:50.912 --> 02:02:52.953]  Look at the Russian economy.
[02:02:52.953 --> 02:02:58.137]  It's 1.8 trillion versus the American economy, which is almost 15 trillion.
[02:02:58.137 --> 02:03:00.779]  1.8 trillion versus 15 trillion.
[02:03:00.779 --> 02:03:04.142]  Clearly, look, people say bad things about capitalism and all this.
[02:03:04.142 --> 02:03:13.129]  It's because they've become lazy butts, because our poor are richer than most people around the world, and so they see the people with wealth, and then it's class envy.
[02:03:13.129 --> 02:03:15.371]  They're mad that there's a bunch of wealth they don't have.
[02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:32.526]  That's the problem with, and communism creates dependency, but it also creates the little commissar managers, the political police, who then, you don't excel because you write the best play or come up with the best product, you excel because you're in charge and somebody's gotta come kiss your butt to save me in the movies.
[02:03:32.526 --> 02:03:35.667]  Like that film based on a true story, The Lives of Others, about East Germany.
[02:03:35.667 --> 02:03:36.548]  Did you see that film?
[02:03:36.548 --> 02:03:37.068]  No, I didn't.
[02:03:37.068 --> 02:03:38.228]  Well, folks ought to watch it.
[02:03:38.228 --> 02:03:41.309]  I didn't see it.
[02:03:41.309 --> 02:03:42.750]  Kevin, you're a great American.
[02:03:44.011 --> 02:03:45.715]  Kevin, you haven't smoked any marijuana today, have you?
[02:03:45.715 --> 02:03:47.860]  No, not yet.
[02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:49.162]  Seriously, let's get serious though.
[02:03:49.162 --> 02:03:50.365]  This is a short segment.
[02:03:50.365 --> 02:03:52.069]  Some stations join us after the segment.
[02:03:52.069 --> 02:03:53.031]  I want to get into...
[02:03:54.264 --> 02:04:02.827]  The state of the world right now, and speaking of Russia, you were asking me about World War and stuff, and is it true, you know, that this country has nukes and that country has nukes.
[02:04:02.827 --> 02:04:09.668]  I was always told where Saudi Arabia got their nukes, where Iran got their nukes, and now that's coming out in the news.
[02:04:09.668 --> 02:04:11.669]  And I was told this by high-level military people.
[02:04:11.669 --> 02:04:17.031]  And back then they were like, you know, you're wrong saying Iran isn't going to get a nuke with those reactors, they already got them.
[02:04:17.031 --> 02:04:21.092]  And by the third or fourth general that told me that, and then family told me that,
[02:04:22.139 --> 02:04:25.121]  Or I was telling family and they said, how do you know that?
[02:04:25.121 --> 02:04:28.604]  And I said, well, I was told this by somebody and he goes, yeah, that's right.
[02:04:28.604 --> 02:04:33.587]  And that's their biggest fear is that Iran and that Saudi Arabia are going to get a nuclear war.
[02:04:33.587 --> 02:04:35.128]  Well, now that's in the news this week.
[02:04:35.128 --> 02:04:43.294]  When we come back with Big Mike, Kevin Booth, we're going to get into that and see how that might affect things and then shift gears into the film, Kevin.
[02:04:43.294 --> 02:04:44.455]  I mean, what's it going to be about now?
[02:04:44.455 --> 02:04:46.396]  Well, I mean, let's just show a clip.
[02:04:47.205 --> 02:04:47.945]  Oh, I forgot!
[02:04:47.945 --> 02:04:48.566]  We have a clip!
[02:04:48.566 --> 02:04:49.586]  We have a clip!
[02:04:49.586 --> 02:04:50.067]  Hey, hey.
[02:04:50.067 --> 02:04:50.887]  Careful point, I'm here.
[02:04:50.887 --> 02:04:51.848]  I tell you.
[02:04:51.848 --> 02:04:53.168]  Well, you've got to direct us, Kevin.
[02:04:53.168 --> 02:04:54.489]  That's what you do.
[02:04:54.489 --> 02:04:55.630]  You're going to direct us when we come back.
[02:04:55.630 --> 02:04:56.270]  You're going to host.
[02:04:56.270 --> 02:04:58.792]  I want you to.
[02:04:58.792 --> 02:05:01.093]  Jeb Bush is out of the presidential race.
[02:05:01.093 --> 02:05:12.119]  The former Florida governor has dropped out of the 2016 White House race after losing the South Carolina primary badly to billionaire Donald Trump, who secured a strong victory with nearly a third of the vote.
[02:05:12.119 --> 02:05:16.742]  Bush formally launched his campaign back in June, about six months after he announced he would run for top office.
[02:05:17.042 --> 02:05:23.886]  He was supported by the Right to Rise Political Action Committee, which had raised in excess $100 million for his campaign launch.
[02:05:23.886 --> 02:05:35.234]  But no amount of money could save Bush, a dorky candidate who at one point actually begged the audience to please clap for him after his speech, and was hilariously thrown off the stage at another speech for going over his allotted time.
[02:05:35.234 --> 02:05:39.957]  People are simply tired of establishment candidates who want amnesty for illegals flooding into the country.
[02:05:40.137 --> 02:05:50.829]  It also didn't help that Bush blew off the idea of releasing the missing 28 pages from the 9-11 report, which were classified not because of national security, but because they reveal Saudi Arabia's involvement in the attacks.

[02:05:55.374 --> 02:05:56.636]  This is Keith Daniels reporting.
[02:05:58.342 --> 02:05:59.162]  Hey, everyone!
[02:05:59.162 --> 02:06:01.463]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[02:06:01.463 --> 02:06:05.305]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[02:06:05.305 --> 02:06:07.386]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[02:06:07.386 --> 02:06:17.650]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[02:06:17.650 --> 02:06:23.633]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[02:06:24.113 --> 02:06:38.931]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[02:06:38.951 --> 02:06:39.131]  Thank you.
[02:06:58.206 --> 02:07:01.409]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[02:07:01.409 --> 02:07:03.770]  Deep Cleanse by InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:07:03.770 --> 02:07:10.776]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[02:07:25.507 --> 02:07:34.396]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[02:07:34.396 --> 02:07:41.483]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spite G-Rex herbal processing technique.

[02:08:14.172 --> 02:08:20.345]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:20.345 --> 02:08:22.730]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:32.691 --> 02:08:37.595]  Alright folks, Big Mike's our guest, Kevin Booth, and we also have Kelly in here.
[02:08:37.595 --> 02:08:40.077]  She's been traveling around with the guys, checking all this out.
[02:08:40.077 --> 02:08:44.161]  I want to play a three-minute clip, kind of a trailer, working title.
[02:08:44.161 --> 02:08:46.243]  When Kevin was here around Christmas, he didn't have it yet.
[02:08:46.243 --> 02:08:47.244]  Ghost Nation.
[02:08:48.024 --> 02:08:55.806]  And so we have Big Mike, the biggest producer of basically marijuana and hemp fertilizer in the world.
[02:08:55.806 --> 02:09:01.387]  And he's been the most successful because, I guess from the reviews out there, he's got the best response.
[02:09:01.387 --> 02:09:08.069]  And folks, again, to all the people out there that say, I can't believe on your show you're promoting marijuana.
[02:09:08.069 --> 02:09:10.870]  It's all a psyop, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:10.870 --> 02:09:12.990]  It decriminalizes it.
[02:09:12.990 --> 02:09:14.171]  It takes the money out of it.
[02:09:14.171 --> 02:09:15.231]  It takes the crime out of it.
[02:09:15.771 --> 02:09:19.733]  This is simply someone multinationally selling fertilizer for plants.
[02:09:19.733 --> 02:09:22.375]  And I would imagine your fertilizer works on other plants too, doesn't it?
[02:09:22.375 --> 02:09:23.295]  Oh, it does.
[02:09:23.295 --> 02:09:23.616]  It's funny.
[02:09:23.616 --> 02:09:24.896]  We have lettuce growers.
[02:09:24.896 --> 02:09:28.779]  They use our organic products to grow organic lettuce.
[02:09:28.779 --> 02:09:30.420]  The guys are breaking world records.
[02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:32.461]  We have records growing for the biggest
[02:09:33.121 --> 02:09:34.041]  I'm not a fan of GMO at all.
[02:09:34.041 --> 02:09:34.741]  What Monsanto has done
[02:09:56.294 --> 02:09:58.996]  To the American farmer is criminal.
[02:09:58.996 --> 02:10:05.663]  They do not allow, in a lot of EU countries, them to do what they've done to the American farmer.
[02:10:05.663 --> 02:10:09.926]  Monsanto is an evil company.
[02:10:09.926 --> 02:10:13.430]  If you look at their passport of directors, it's a who's who in government.
[02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:15.932]  They don't like a law, they just go in and change it.
[02:10:15.932 --> 02:10:17.653]  And they're going to try to come into our space?
[02:10:18.775 --> 02:10:22.477]  Uh, and they're, you know, they're going to make a run at it.
[02:10:22.477 --> 02:10:24.038]  And we have to be really, really careful.
[02:10:24.038 --> 02:10:30.643]  Do we really want Monsanto in there making frankenplants that people are consuming as medicine?
[02:10:31.448 --> 02:10:32.469]  God only knows what they're doing.
[02:10:32.469 --> 02:10:33.489]  Look what they did with Roundup.
[02:10:33.489 --> 02:10:34.910]  Now we've got super weeds.
[02:10:34.910 --> 02:10:43.554]  They actually leave the pharmacological crop market where they have plants actually producing chemicals and producing quote drugs and then it can jump into other plant species.
[02:10:43.554 --> 02:10:44.755]  That's just crazy.
[02:10:44.755 --> 02:10:46.396]  And you know where they're doing it?
[02:10:46.396 --> 02:10:48.296]  Because I got a call once.
[02:10:48.296 --> 02:10:49.477]  I declined.
[02:10:49.477 --> 02:10:51.678]  But they're underground.
[02:10:51.678 --> 02:10:56.981]  They're literally underground in places, in warehouses that are non-descript.
[02:10:57.581 --> 02:11:06.187]  And they're doing this genetic Frankenstein plants where they're taking genes, you know, from different animals and they're just, God only knows what they're doing.
[02:11:06.187 --> 02:11:19.516]  Now, that's in the medical literature now, but not generally known, but here you are as an insider, just in that you're an industrial, you know, a producer of organic products to help grow plants, and so you're actually getting contacted.
[02:11:19.516 --> 02:11:22.218]  That's where this is going on, in fact, right here in Austin.
[02:11:22.218 --> 02:11:25.961]  They have, when you say underground, nondescript warehouses all over.
[02:11:26.738 --> 02:11:28.219]  That even have front offices and everything.
[02:11:28.219 --> 02:11:31.322]  But you go in, it goes through a bio seal, you name it.
[02:11:31.322 --> 02:11:33.804]  It's about level 3 containment.
[02:11:33.804 --> 02:11:37.487]  And they've got pharmacological crops growing in there right now because plants...
[02:11:38.410 --> 02:11:39.131]  Can produce anything.
[02:11:39.131 --> 02:11:45.595]  In fact, they engineered protogen about 12 years ago, engineered HIV that grew in corn.
[02:11:45.595 --> 02:11:48.357]  Corn's the best plant for growing pharmacological crops.
[02:11:48.357 --> 02:11:50.679]  You just program it and it grows it inside of it.
[02:11:50.679 --> 02:11:52.540]  And it was unattenuated virus was the word.
[02:11:52.540 --> 02:11:55.802]  They had guys in spacesuits up by Waco.
[02:11:55.802 --> 02:11:59.605]  They were growing the stuff outdoors.
[02:11:59.605 --> 02:12:03.228]  They had guys in spacesuits there with flamethrowers knocking it out.
[02:12:03.228 --> 02:12:04.148]  And then I reported it.
[02:12:04.148 --> 02:12:05.970]  People didn't believe it, even though it was in the Associated Press.
[02:12:07.079 --> 02:12:09.741]  Guys in spacesuits with flamethrowers.
[02:12:09.741 --> 02:12:15.787]  What I will say is, Monsanto had, we test on also other crops as well.
[02:12:15.787 --> 02:12:19.610]  Our test spot was right next to Monsanto's in Bulgaria.
[02:12:19.610 --> 02:12:24.174]  And the Monsanto scientists came over to our scientists and go, how did you grow corn like that?
[02:12:25.639 --> 02:12:29.001]  And of course I didn't say anything, and we actually swapped here.
[02:12:29.001 --> 02:12:31.302]  You take a few of ours, we'll take a few of yours.
[02:12:31.302 --> 02:12:31.802]  We tested.
[02:12:31.802 --> 02:12:35.464]  We had 14% more protein in our corn.
[02:12:35.464 --> 02:12:38.946]  The biofuel would have yielded another 30% higher.
[02:12:38.946 --> 02:12:44.469]  So I'm like a little company called Advanced Nutrients, $50 million a year company, up against this
[02:12:45.262 --> 02:12:50.085]  A multi-billion dollar giant and we kicked their butts.
[02:12:50.085 --> 02:12:51.185]  I'm happy, I'm proud of that.
[02:12:51.185 --> 02:12:53.747]  It's kind of cool.
[02:12:53.747 --> 02:12:57.669]  Kevin, again, your films sometimes take 6-7 years to make.
[02:12:57.669 --> 02:13:03.232]  How long until this new film Ghost Nation comes out?
[02:13:03.232 --> 02:13:05.954]  We're hoping to be in festivals by July.
[02:13:08.291 --> 02:13:11.093]  And then after that, a cable network will buy it, or are you already under contract?
[02:13:11.093 --> 02:13:11.593]  Yeah.
[02:13:11.593 --> 02:13:13.274]  No, we'll be shopping it.
[02:13:13.274 --> 02:13:27.063]  In fact, my agent manager, Christopher, is back here with us, and yeah, I mean, we're hopefully going to take it to festivals, hopefully getting some sort of a broadcast deal, theatrical, and then end up on Netflix, that type of thing.
[02:13:27.723 --> 02:13:37.647]  Well, I'm really happy for your success, because your films have all been really successful, and it's good to see you, just over the decades, continuing to put out such great research.
[02:13:37.647 --> 02:13:39.987]  Introduce this clip we're about to play for folks.
[02:13:39.987 --> 02:13:47.430]  This is just a trailer that we just finished cutting, and I don't know, hopefully it's self-explanatory.
[02:13:47.430 --> 02:13:48.931]  So this is a working title, Ghost Nation?
[02:13:48.931 --> 02:13:49.251]  Ghost Nation.
[02:13:49.251 --> 02:13:49.911]  Let's go ahead and roll it.
[02:13:53.590 --> 02:14:03.393]  The corruption in Bulgaria is the reason that we are so poor.
[02:14:03.393 --> 02:14:09.815]  The politicians were trying to make us be invisible.
[02:14:09.815 --> 02:14:17.017]  All the media were saying there are 300-500 people while there were thousands, I mean tens of thousands.
[02:14:17.017 --> 02:14:20.278]  I'll tell my kids to tell you if something happens to me.
[02:14:24.810 --> 02:14:29.231]  They would be afraid of me when I say I'm going to protest.
[02:14:29.231 --> 02:14:36.393]  We don't have capitalism and democracy, we have the mafia.
[02:14:36.393 --> 02:14:39.834]  This guy who owns your music here.
[02:14:39.834 --> 02:14:40.154]  Yes.
[02:14:40.154 --> 02:14:50.156]  I'm telling you this directly.
[02:14:50.156 --> 02:14:53.157]  You're all criminals.
[02:15:00.385 --> 02:15:10.814]  There is a very strong threat coming from Russia.
[02:15:10.814 --> 02:15:18.180]  Also, we should not forget about ISIS.
[02:15:18.180 --> 02:15:22.063]  Only one country is between ISIS and Bulgaria, it's Turkey.
[02:15:22.063 --> 02:15:23.965]  Stop the flow of terrorists.
[02:15:25.627 --> 02:15:27.968]  Maybe we are doing this, but we must do more.
[02:15:27.968 --> 02:15:29.249]  Who is killing?
[02:15:29.249 --> 02:15:30.449]  Who is attacking?
[02:15:30.449 --> 02:15:31.790]  Who is assaulting?
[02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:37.153]  Without any reason, or with any reason, it doesn't matter.
[02:15:37.153 --> 02:15:47.357]  The threat of direct terror attack is so strong in Bulgaria.
[02:15:47.357 --> 02:15:48.258]  And what they did was,
[02:15:49.611 --> 02:15:58.136]  As soon as they start to attack, they start to spread their videos over the internet and start to spread their propaganda.
[02:15:58.136 --> 02:16:05.481]  For you, out of Paris, France, several people have been killed, a shooting in central Paris.
[02:16:05.481 --> 02:16:07.222]  Tell me what you know.
[02:16:07.222 --> 02:16:11.785]  I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.
[02:16:14.224 --> 02:16:14.544]  Get out of here!
[02:16:14.544 --> 02:16:15.284]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:15.284 --> 02:16:16.064]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:16.064 --> 02:16:16.865]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:16.865 --> 02:16:17.605]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:17.605 --> 02:16:18.485]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:18.485 --> 02:16:19.565]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:19.565 --> 02:16:20.226]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:20.226 --> 02:16:21.086]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:21.086 --> 02:16:21.826]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:21.826 --> 02:16:22.666]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:22.666 --> 02:16:23.646]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:23.646 --> 02:16:24.427]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:24.427 --> 02:16:25.567]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:25.567 --> 02:16:26.287]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:26.287 --> 02:16:27.227]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:27.227 --> 02:16:27.967]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:27.967 --> 02:16:29.048]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:29.048 --> 02:16:29.948]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:29.948 --> 02:16:30.708]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:30.708 --> 02:16:31.368]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:31.368 --> 02:16:32.028]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:32.028 --> 02:16:32.729]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:32.729 --> 02:16:33.409]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:33.409 --> 02:16:34.049]  I don't know what's going on!
[02:16:34.049 --> 02:16:34.189]  I don't
[02:16:35.737 --> 02:16:37.979]  I don't know if I will breathe, but I'm very angry.
[02:16:37.979 --> 02:16:40.221]  I will become more and more angry.
[02:16:40.221 --> 02:16:43.885]  If Western civilization is not awake, it's a problem.
[02:17:12.501 --> 02:17:16.317]  Now, Kevin, if they're fighting communism, what's the thing with the red fists and red flags?
[02:17:17.628 --> 02:17:18.868]  I don't know, it's just a graphic.
[02:17:18.868 --> 02:17:21.969]  It's nothing about, it's just rising up against the power.
[02:17:21.969 --> 02:17:22.989]  No, no, I get it, I get it.
[02:17:22.989 --> 02:17:23.990]  And that's a good point.
[02:17:23.990 --> 02:17:26.390]  We can't let governments expropriate symbols.
[02:17:26.390 --> 02:17:29.191]  It's like in India, they want them to take swastikas down.
[02:17:29.191 --> 02:17:33.692]  You know, they were there 3,000 years ago, or at Native American lodges, people were saying, take them down.
[02:17:33.692 --> 02:17:35.493]  It's a sun symbol.
[02:17:35.493 --> 02:17:36.573]  Every culture uses it.
[02:17:36.573 --> 02:17:37.954]  It doesn't belong to Hitler.
[02:17:37.954 --> 02:17:43.715]  But at the same time, you see a fist and a red background, because that's kind of the Russians, you could say, are kind of the fist and the red background.
[02:17:43.715 --> 02:17:44.996]  All right, all right, I'll put a little red back there.
[02:17:44.996 --> 02:17:46.316]  No, I'm not saying change it!
[02:17:46.736 --> 02:17:47.437]  I'm just asking.
[02:17:47.437 --> 02:17:49.359]  Put a little red, white, and blue in there, Corey.
[02:17:49.359 --> 02:17:51.080]  Yeah, put some red, white, and blue in there.
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:52.742]  In five minutes, we'll get it posted again.
[02:17:52.742 --> 02:17:53.242]  No, no, no.
[02:17:53.242 --> 02:17:56.665]  For radio listeners, this looks like a huge budget film.
[02:17:56.665 --> 02:17:58.247]  In fact, I was hearing it has a pretty big budget.
[02:17:58.247 --> 02:18:01.670]  Yeah, definitely the biggest budget I've ever had, for sure.
[02:18:01.670 --> 02:18:03.231]  What's the budget?
[02:18:03.231 --> 02:18:05.593]  What's the budget, Mike?
[02:18:05.593 --> 02:18:05.994]  1.4.
[02:18:05.994 --> 02:18:06.815]  That's pretty good, yeah.
[02:18:07.645 --> 02:18:08.986]  And I saw a lot of drone footage in there.
[02:18:08.986 --> 02:18:09.466]  It looks really good.
[02:18:09.466 --> 02:18:11.828]  Yeah, we've crashed three expensive drones so far.
[02:18:11.828 --> 02:18:18.013]  I've been knocked out of the sky by people and been droning over gangsters' homes and politicians' homes.
[02:18:18.013 --> 02:18:26.319]  Now you were saying a bunch of hardcore stuff while the trailer was playing that I totally agree with because a lot of this is a whole ISIS angle because you've got Putin coming in from one side.
[02:18:26.319 --> 02:18:28.861]  We've also got ISIS coming in and then you've got the West.
[02:18:28.861 --> 02:18:30.142]  So I guess three different factions?
[02:18:30.142 --> 02:18:30.342]  Right.
[02:18:31.175 --> 02:18:32.296]  Big Mike?
[02:18:32.296 --> 02:18:34.819]  You know, here you got the House of Saud.
[02:18:34.819 --> 02:18:39.184]  The House of Saud goes and they build these mosques all over the place.
[02:18:39.184 --> 02:18:47.433]  And they're building a lot in Albania, they're building a lot in Macedonia, they're building some in Bulgaria, not as much as Macedonia and Albania.
[02:18:47.433 --> 02:18:52.879]  However, each one of these points, and here's the dangerous part in Bulgaria, they don't
[02:18:53.592 --> 02:18:56.353]  They forced them to adopt the Bulgarian language.
[02:18:56.353 --> 02:19:00.014]  They allowed them not to speak Bulgarian.
[02:19:00.014 --> 02:19:00.975]  So it creates ghettos.
[02:19:00.975 --> 02:19:03.075]  So it creates ghettos, but it creates isolation.
[02:19:03.075 --> 02:19:11.278]  And in that isolation around that mosque, you now have the ability to recruit terrorists.
[02:19:11.278 --> 02:19:14.819]  Putin is fighting ISIS and Al-Qaeda in Saudi Arabia.
[02:19:14.819 --> 02:19:16.320]  Saudi Arabia is starting war on Russia.
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:18.901]  So again, who are the factions?
[02:19:20.157 --> 02:19:21.037]  It's confusing.
[02:19:21.037 --> 02:19:27.599]  Like, you sit there and you try to get, you peel back and you think, okay, we're finally getting, like, we kind of understand it now, what's going on.
[02:19:27.599 --> 02:19:29.660]  And it's just like, it just gets worse and worse.
[02:19:29.660 --> 02:19:31.860]  Who is the Jabba the Hutt creature that you said is a bad guy?
[02:19:31.860 --> 02:19:33.961]  Because I notice the arrogance.
[02:19:33.961 --> 02:19:34.961]  We're going to skip this break.
[02:19:34.961 --> 02:19:35.961]  I'm going to skip this one break.
[02:19:35.961 --> 02:19:38.102]  I should have told you.
[02:19:38.102 --> 02:19:38.702]  Cut the music there.
[02:19:39.872 --> 02:19:40.593]  Who is that guy?
[02:19:40.593 --> 02:19:41.634]  Pesky.
[02:19:41.634 --> 02:19:42.835]  Oh, Pesky.
[02:19:42.835 --> 02:19:44.957]  Is he a Mr. Universe?
[02:19:44.957 --> 02:19:47.479]  He's a pig.
[02:19:47.479 --> 02:19:49.441]  And literally is.
[02:19:49.441 --> 02:19:54.386]  He controls the majority of the media in Bulgaria.
[02:19:54.386 --> 02:19:55.187]  Is he a Russian puppet?
[02:19:56.397 --> 02:19:59.220]  Oh, he not only is he a Russian puppet, he's an ISIS puppet.
[02:19:59.220 --> 02:20:00.461]  And that's the problem.
[02:20:00.461 --> 02:20:05.785]  This guy, the second largest party in Bulgaria is a party called Depesey.
[02:20:05.785 --> 02:20:09.068]  He is one of their leaders.
[02:20:09.068 --> 02:20:10.929]  Now, now, I asked you this earlier in a break.
[02:20:10.929 --> 02:20:12.070]  You said he's connected to ISIS.
[02:20:12.070 --> 02:20:12.671]  What's the proof?
[02:20:12.671 --> 02:20:14.472]  You said it's in the German news?
[02:20:14.472 --> 02:20:15.333]  It's in the German news.
[02:20:15.333 --> 02:20:22.139]  The German, it was in the German news, but it was also German intelligence substantiated said, yes, this is true.
[02:20:22.139 --> 02:20:24.261]  These guys, by the way, it's,
[02:20:25.287 --> 02:20:30.534]  The four biggest political parties, their leaders, all have a cigarette tax scam going.
[02:20:30.534 --> 02:20:34.378]  And because of that, they involve ISIS.
[02:20:34.378 --> 02:20:37.102]  And payments are going to ISIS.
[02:20:37.102 --> 02:20:37.302]  So...
[02:20:38.396 --> 02:20:39.036]  Wake up.
[02:20:39.036 --> 02:20:42.279]  I'm telling the American politicians, wake up and do something about it.
[02:20:42.279 --> 02:20:43.780]  This is government of mafias.
[02:20:43.780 --> 02:20:47.943]  And because the people lay down and have an attitude of putting up with it, all these corrupt interests come in.
[02:20:47.943 --> 02:20:53.507]  And I guess what you're saying is out of the Soviet Union, they got their will broken, and so now they just expect to live under tyranny.
[02:20:53.507 --> 02:20:56.529]  And so it's all these competing factions in there at the trough.
[02:20:57.469 --> 02:20:57.869]  Well said.
[02:21:12.602 --> 02:21:13.062]  No real government.
[02:21:13.062 --> 02:21:14.443]  They're not trying to govern.
[02:21:14.443 --> 02:21:26.192]  All they're trying to do is steal and make deals with ISIS and make deals with Putin, and yet they say, hey, protect us, you know, give us EU status, give us NATO status.
[02:21:26.192 --> 02:21:29.375]  Okay, we did that, and this is still happening.
[02:21:29.375 --> 02:21:33.137]  If America stepped in very quickly, they could end this.
[02:21:33.137 --> 02:21:34.578]  Very, very quickly.
[02:21:34.578 --> 02:21:35.639]  And the EU.
[02:21:35.639 --> 02:21:38.361]  It could be over within a year.
[02:21:38.361 --> 02:21:40.343]  Are you sure the Russians wouldn't try to come in?
[02:21:42.509 --> 02:21:43.851]  It's an EU nation.
[02:21:43.851 --> 02:21:44.772]  It's a NATO nation.
[02:21:44.772 --> 02:21:47.156]  They would be stupid if they tried.
[02:21:47.156 --> 02:21:48.257]  Anything's possible.
[02:21:48.257 --> 02:21:51.662]  Like, look, Obama has a weak foreign policy.
[02:21:51.662 --> 02:21:53.004]  We all know that.
[02:21:53.004 --> 02:21:56.189]  And he allows himself to get bullied.
[02:21:58.820 --> 02:22:00.302]  Like you take a guy like Trump.
[02:22:00.302 --> 02:22:02.965]  Trump, I don't think he's going to allow what happened.
[02:22:02.965 --> 02:22:09.792]  Bush, even like the things that I have about Bush, some of the bad things that I think about him, he was very strong foreign policy.
[02:22:09.792 --> 02:22:12.175]  Putin wouldn't try that under Bush.
[02:22:12.175 --> 02:22:14.217]  He wouldn't try it under Trump.
[02:22:14.217 --> 02:22:17.501]  But yet Obama, there's no foreign policy.
[02:22:17.501 --> 02:22:17.761]  And so
[02:22:18.846 --> 02:22:21.309]  He's just going around doing whatever he's got to do.
[02:22:21.309 --> 02:22:23.873]  Obama's too busy trying to turn the world over to a new caliphate.
[02:22:23.873 --> 02:22:25.154]  You were talking about that during the break.
[02:22:25.154 --> 02:22:30.041]  Well yeah, and so if you look at what ISIS wants, they have a map.
[02:22:30.041 --> 02:22:34.366]  And it's like, this is our nation we want to create.
[02:22:34.366 --> 02:22:35.668]  It's the Ottoman Empire.
[02:22:35.948 --> 02:22:38.551]  ISIS map of worldwide caliphate, let's put that up on the screen.
[02:22:38.551 --> 02:22:39.431]  Yeah, that is it.
[02:22:39.431 --> 02:22:40.612]  It's the old Ottoman Empire.
[02:22:40.612 --> 02:22:41.453]  They want it back.
[02:22:41.453 --> 02:22:42.915]  And that includes Spain!
[02:22:42.915 --> 02:22:43.455]  Spain!
[02:22:43.455 --> 02:22:47.419]  I mean, Bulgaria was under Turkish rule for what, 5,000 years?
[02:22:47.419 --> 02:22:50.522]  Oh, no, Ottoman Empire, no, it was 500 years.
[02:22:50.522 --> 02:22:54.365]  Then in 1887... See, here's the problem.
[02:22:54.365 --> 02:22:56.867]  In 1887, the Russians... Muslim invasions were in the 800s.
[02:22:56.867 --> 02:22:57.248]  600s and 800s.
[02:22:57.248 --> 02:22:59.970]  Right, and so there was... And they got repulsed.
[02:22:59.970 --> 02:23:01.312]  They finally went all the way to Rome.
[02:23:02.032 --> 02:23:04.953]  That's why the Pope has 200 foot walls, was for that invasion.
[02:23:04.953 --> 02:23:08.734]  They went from 100 feet to 200 feet, and he says we... And now they lie and go, there are no walls around the Vatican.
[02:23:08.734 --> 02:23:13.076]  I mean, this is the New York Times, folks, that just announced today that most cancer is viral.
[02:23:13.076 --> 02:23:16.357]  As if that wasn't known from day one when Rockefeller was messing with it.
[02:23:16.357 --> 02:23:17.638]  Oh yeah, there's their map right there.
[02:23:17.638 --> 02:23:20.098]  I'm sorry, I interrupted.
[02:23:20.098 --> 02:23:23.740]  That's what ISIS thinks they... That's correct.
[02:23:23.740 --> 02:23:24.160]  ...deserve to have.
[02:23:25.626 --> 02:23:40.135]  You know that Spain used to be blonde-haired, blue-eyed folks, and they got taken over for 300 years, and then Europe had an invasion called the La Reconquista, and kicked the North Africans out.
[02:23:40.135 --> 02:23:41.096]  So that's why they think it's theirs.
[02:23:44.457 --> 02:23:46.840]  People in America should be worried.
[02:23:46.840 --> 02:23:50.964]  People in the EU definitely should be worried if you look at that map.
[02:23:50.964 --> 02:23:52.306]  That's their endgame.
[02:23:52.306 --> 02:23:58.993]  Exactly, my issue is Iraq was pro-West, Jordan is, a bunch of other countries, Egypt...
[02:23:59.654 --> 02:24:02.818]  They have women go to college, women don't have to cover their faces up, all this stuff.
[02:24:02.818 --> 02:24:03.919]  They like America.
[02:24:03.919 --> 02:24:17.733]  Our government's trying to overthrow all those countries and putting Saudi-run, Al-Qaeda, ISIS crazies, who literally keep women chained up like a pet snail or something, and that supposedly is okay, and the left...
[02:24:18.394 --> 02:24:24.723]  Won't even criticize it and actually is bringing the refugees in are mainly these crazy Wahhabis.
[02:24:24.723 --> 02:24:26.105]  What do you think the endgame plan is?
[02:24:26.105 --> 02:24:27.787]  You've been over there, you've witnessed it.
[02:24:27.787 --> 02:24:30.832]  What do you think Merkel and Hollande and Obama are doing?
[02:24:31.803 --> 02:24:32.763]  They're asleep at the wheel.
[02:24:32.763 --> 02:24:39.726]  Like, I don't know, I'm not like the super pundit when it comes to politics, but from my viewpoint, they're asleep at the wheel.
[02:24:39.726 --> 02:24:41.427]  Let me talk about Turkey.
[02:24:41.427 --> 02:24:44.528]  People don't realize, Turkey's a member of NATO.
[02:24:44.528 --> 02:24:47.689]  They're going to do $5 billion worth of business with the U.S.
[02:24:47.689 --> 02:24:48.970]  for F-35 fighters.
[02:24:48.970 --> 02:24:56.793]  So we kind of, we have a military, I think it's a submarine base there, a Navy base somewhere there, and they just kind of turn a blind eye to what Turkey does.
[02:24:56.793 --> 02:25:00.995]  And here's, this is horrible, they're allowing
[02:25:01.937 --> 02:25:12.344]  ISIS soldiers that come in through Iraq and they're coming in through Turkey and they're going back into Syria and they're slaughtering people.
[02:25:12.344 --> 02:25:20.549]  I've had pictures shown to me, I was about a year and a half ago, I was in Beirut, I was there with an Armenian community and they showed me pictures.
[02:25:20.549 --> 02:25:26.814]  These are horrific pictures and these ISIS soldiers went in, decimated these people,
[02:25:27.659 --> 02:25:34.763]  We're brought back in ambulances across the border, back into Turkey, and put back into Iraq.
[02:25:34.763 --> 02:25:37.345]  There was a woman who reported on that.
[02:25:37.345 --> 02:25:38.746]  Two weeks later, she's dead.
[02:25:38.746 --> 02:25:39.406]  Wow.
[02:25:39.406 --> 02:25:43.569]  Well, see, to Putin's credit, he sent in troops, planes.
[02:25:43.569 --> 02:25:45.650]  He's battling Turkey.
[02:25:45.650 --> 02:25:47.631]  He says, Turkey, you're running al-Qaeda.
[02:25:47.631 --> 02:25:49.713]  Turkey, you're stealing the oil, and proved it.
[02:25:50.313 --> 02:25:55.035]  And so Turkey's now threatening to attack Russia, and Russia's threatening to attack them, so that's what I'm saying.
[02:25:55.035 --> 02:25:57.816]  I don't think there is a good guy overall in this.
[02:25:57.816 --> 02:26:04.098]  I just wonder why the West isn't actually trying to help a place, you know, like the country you're talking about.
[02:26:04.098 --> 02:26:08.560]  Instead, they're involved in Syria, trying to overthrow it, to put Saudi Arabia in charge.
[02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:10.761]  Makes you wonder, doesn't it?
[02:26:10.761 --> 02:26:15.642]  Well, we know weapons manufacturers make money out of crisis, and people keep saying none of this makes sense.
[02:26:15.642 --> 02:26:16.903]  It makes more conflict, more war.
[02:26:17.975 --> 02:26:20.817]  Eisenhower warned us about the military-industrial complex.
[02:26:20.817 --> 02:26:22.839]  Kelly, your view on this?
[02:26:22.839 --> 02:26:31.625]  I... I don't... I... I... I don't know where... You don't know where to begin.
[02:26:31.625 --> 02:26:32.125]  I don't know.
[02:26:32.125 --> 02:26:33.706]  No, I can't.
[02:26:33.706 --> 02:26:35.007]  You're doing good.
[02:26:35.007 --> 02:26:36.068]  I can't.
[02:26:36.068 --> 02:26:38.590]  No, I can't.
[02:26:38.590 --> 02:26:45.835]  It's all... Does the world sound like it's closer to a world war now, or when you were a little girl and there was a Cold War going on?
[02:26:46.559 --> 02:26:48.021]  If we're upset again.
[02:26:48.021 --> 02:26:54.687]  The Cold War when you were younger, does that world sound scarier than this new world we're in?
[02:26:54.687 --> 02:26:55.628]  No.
[02:26:55.628 --> 02:26:58.031]  It seems scarier now.
[02:26:58.031 --> 02:27:03.897]  And I don't know if it's because, like, I don't know, everything
[02:27:05.862 --> 02:27:11.504]  Everything that I'm finding out and just, you know, everything that's going on, it's, everything's really scary.
[02:27:11.504 --> 02:27:27.771]  Why do you think Unified Europe and the United States would have the exact same policy, because they're doing this on purpose, would bring in five million in the last two years radical Islamic refugees who kill each other if someone catches their daughter out without her face covered?
[02:27:27.771 --> 02:27:30.192]  I mean, they will kill you, stone your daughter to death,
[02:27:31.735 --> 02:27:36.698]  This is the most unliberal, psychotic group of numbskull idiots.
[02:27:36.698 --> 02:27:46.363]  Why would you bring them in, and why would the left, who claims they're so liberal and about people's rights, bring in Stone Age lunatics?
[02:27:46.363 --> 02:27:46.984]  God only knows.
[02:27:46.984 --> 02:27:47.704]  I don't know.
[02:27:47.704 --> 02:27:49.866]  Create chaos?
[02:27:49.866 --> 02:27:50.666]  Bingo, Kevin.
[02:27:50.666 --> 02:27:52.067]  Create chaos.
[02:27:52.067 --> 02:27:53.748]  Do I win something?
[02:27:53.748 --> 02:27:55.609]  You do win something.
[02:27:55.609 --> 02:27:59.031]  You know, Kevin's actually a tough guy in another incarnation.
[02:27:59.031 --> 02:28:00.732]  He actually starred in Ninja Bachelor Party.
[02:28:02.586 --> 02:28:05.068]  You know, that thing is so famous underground now.
[02:28:05.068 --> 02:28:06.369]  Somebody ought to remake it.
[02:28:06.369 --> 02:28:06.829]  Yeah, I know.
[02:28:06.829 --> 02:28:09.091]  I have people talking to us about that, yeah.
[02:28:09.091 --> 02:28:09.652]  Oh, really?
[02:28:09.652 --> 02:28:10.592]  About cartoons.
[02:28:10.592 --> 02:28:12.314]  What's going on with Russell Crowe?
[02:28:12.314 --> 02:28:12.794]  You talk about that?
[02:28:12.794 --> 02:28:13.154]  No, no, no.
[02:28:13.154 --> 02:28:14.415]  I can't talk about any of that.
[02:28:14.415 --> 02:28:15.316]  I'll drop that.
[02:28:15.316 --> 02:28:16.077]  I'll talk about it.
[02:28:16.077 --> 02:28:16.597]  I can't talk about it.
[02:28:16.597 --> 02:28:18.098]  How does it make you sound cool and mysterious?
[02:28:18.098 --> 02:28:19.619]  Yeah, I don't know, man.
[02:28:19.619 --> 02:28:21.241]  Let's drop that subject right now.
[02:28:21.837 --> 02:28:29.461]  Hey, seriously though, what do you think about the new X-Files character, and they have another premiere tonight, and Chris Carter.
[02:28:29.461 --> 02:28:30.262]  By the way, I'll come out.
[02:28:30.262 --> 02:28:30.802]  I'm coming out to L.A.
[02:28:30.802 --> 02:28:31.603]  in the next month.
[02:28:31.603 --> 02:28:34.684]  I'm going to come see you, Joe Rogan, and Chris Carter.
[02:28:34.684 --> 02:28:35.165]  Excellent.
[02:28:35.165 --> 02:28:37.406]  We've got to have you up at the Marijuana Mansion then.
[02:28:37.466 --> 02:28:38.727]  Yeah, come to the Marijuana Mansion.
[02:28:38.727 --> 02:28:41.871]  No, I don't have to smoke to go there.
[02:28:41.871 --> 02:28:43.372]  Just like chill.
[02:28:43.372 --> 02:28:46.976]  I got the most incredible view from the Hollywood sign all the way to Beverly Hills.
[02:28:46.976 --> 02:28:47.557]  Jack Daniels.
[02:28:47.557 --> 02:28:47.717]  270.
[02:28:47.717 --> 02:28:48.518]  I'll have Jack.
[02:28:48.518 --> 02:28:50.060]  I'll have... Gentleman, Jack, for you.
[02:28:50.060 --> 02:28:50.400]  How's that?
[02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:51.221]  No, I'm just joking.
[02:28:51.221 --> 02:28:51.821]  I don't drink.
[02:28:51.821 --> 02:28:52.082]  I'm just...
[02:28:55.447 --> 02:28:57.288]  I don't drink before five, I'm joking.
[02:28:57.288 --> 02:28:59.329]  It's a Christian family show.
[02:28:59.329 --> 02:29:04.372]  I actually lost a lot of weight not drinking as much, so I've cut back to maybe a beer every once in a while.
[02:29:04.372 --> 02:29:05.893]  Alcohol has a lot of sugar in it.
[02:29:05.893 --> 02:29:06.753]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:29:06.753 --> 02:29:13.197]  You know what, I used to drink a lot of wine, and since I've made the switch over to marijuana, I've lost a lot of weight, too.
[02:29:13.197 --> 02:29:14.757]  Well, you don't look like you need to lose any weight.
[02:29:14.757 --> 02:29:16.278]  That's for sure.
[02:29:16.278 --> 02:29:18.239]  In fact, let's just stand up, please, ma'am.
[02:29:18.239 --> 02:29:19.420]  Let's see what the marijuana did to you.
[02:29:19.420 --> 02:29:19.860]  Take a spin.
[02:29:19.860 --> 02:29:20.320]  Take a spin.
[02:29:23.942 --> 02:29:25.683]  Anyways, folks, we gotta have some fun.
[02:29:25.683 --> 02:29:26.323]  Oh, come on.
[02:29:26.323 --> 02:29:27.243]  Come on.
[02:29:27.243 --> 02:29:27.743]  Come on.
[02:29:27.743 --> 02:29:28.363]  Stand up.
[02:29:28.363 --> 02:29:29.064]  Show like.
[02:29:29.064 --> 02:29:30.624]  This is eye candy.
[02:29:30.624 --> 02:29:31.784]  A true Amazon.
[02:29:31.784 --> 02:29:32.585]  Very good.
[02:29:32.585 --> 02:29:35.466]  I wanted to say, why don't they get you to play the new Wonder Woman?
[02:29:35.466 --> 02:29:36.386]  Look at that.
[02:29:36.386 --> 02:29:37.426]  Alright, my gosh.
[02:29:37.426 --> 02:29:39.167]  He's as tall as Big Mike.
[02:29:39.167 --> 02:29:39.847]  You know, get... Almost is.
[02:29:40.707 --> 02:29:41.547]  Do what?
[02:29:41.547 --> 02:29:43.168]  She almost is.
[02:29:43.168 --> 02:29:44.529]  With those heels.
[02:29:44.529 --> 02:29:46.229]  Listen, Kelly, thank you for coming in.
[02:29:46.229 --> 02:29:49.451]  We're going to bring in your Eastern European friend, the political activist.
[02:29:49.451 --> 02:29:50.131]  Stay with us.
[02:29:50.131 --> 02:29:51.911]  We're going to bring in, what's his name, Ivan?
[02:29:51.911 --> 02:29:53.052]  Alex Jones.
[02:29:53.052 --> 02:29:53.872]  Who would have thought?
[02:29:53.872 --> 02:29:54.372]  We'll be back.
[02:29:54.372 --> 02:29:54.753]  Stay with us.
[02:29:58.666 --> 02:30:04.994]  Putin has reportedly threatened to launch tactical nukes at Turkey if the ISIS-supporting country invades Syria with Saudi Arabia.
[02:30:04.994 --> 02:30:09.419]  The Russians have about 20,000 troops in Syria helping the Syrian government fight ISIS.
[02:30:09.419 --> 02:30:15.727]  And Putin warned the Turkish president that Moscow is prepared to use tactical nuclear weapons to protect its troops if Turkey attacks.
[02:30:16.207 --> 02:30:26.433]  Since Turkey is part of NATO, any such conflict could quickly escalate into a full-scale nuclear confrontation, said award-winning Iran-Contra journalist Robert Perry, who was tipped off about the warning.
[02:30:26.433 --> 02:30:35.017]  Moscow's apparent threat to repel a Turkish invasion of Syria with nukes follows a warning by the Russian Prime Minister that another world war will erupt if the U.S.
[02:30:35.017 --> 02:30:37.439]  and its allies send ground troops into Syria.
[02:30:37.439 --> 02:30:43.742]  And if Syria falls, Russia will be geopolitically isolated from the rest of the world, which is exactly what the globalists want.
[02:30:44.062 --> 02:30:46.804]  So they can easily hijack and control the country.
[02:30:46.804 --> 02:30:55.768]  And further adding to the threat of world war, Saudi Arabia is currently staging the biggest war game the region has seen in 25 years, according to Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:30:55.768 --> 02:30:57.069]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[02:30:58.444 --> 02:31:01.966]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:31:01.966 --> 02:31:10.211]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:10.211 --> 02:31:15.615]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:31:15.615 --> 02:31:18.156]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[02:31:59.551 --> 02:32:03.314]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:32:03.314 --> 02:32:11.059]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:32:11.059 --> 02:32:19.685]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:32:19.685 --> 02:32:24.087]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:32:24.087 --> 02:32:29.391]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[02:32:29.671 --> 02:32:33.914]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:32:33.914 --> 02:32:37.316]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[02:32:37.316 --> 02:32:48.464]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[02:32:48.464 --> 02:32:51.366]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[02:32:51.366 --> 02:32:57.350]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at Infowarslife.com with AnthroPlex.
[02:33:16.457 --> 02:33:20.540]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:20.540 --> 02:33:22.822]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:22.822 --> 02:33:37.473]  You know, Kevin told me about working on this film about a year and a half ago, and it was in its embryonic stage, and that it was taking this turn into Eastern Europe, and, you know, how horrible Putin was and all this stuff, and I said, well, you're gonna find it's a whole bunch of factions, and you're not gonna be able to even figure out who they are.
[02:33:37.473 --> 02:33:42.837]  And as you turn into more of a Old World country, or a Byzantine-type system,
[02:33:44.591 --> 02:33:52.673]  It's all just based on gangs, it's all just based on thuggery, and then everything descends into that because what's the point of producing anything if somebody just takes it from you?
[02:33:52.673 --> 02:33:58.215]  And you look at Eastern Europe, you look at Latin America, we are becoming just like that.
[02:33:58.215 --> 02:34:04.197]  As we become a system based on what group we're in, not a system based on what you produced and free association.
[02:34:06.001 --> 02:34:07.462]  Now, we're going to go back to our guest.
[02:34:07.462 --> 02:34:19.293]  We have another guest in here with us as well, who's really got an interesting story, who has been over there and actually witnessed all of this, who's a native of Bulgaria, and a big part of the upcoming film as well.
[02:34:19.293 --> 02:34:22.375]  And I was talking to Daria, who's an American, but in the U.S.
[02:34:22.375 --> 02:34:22.836]  military.
[02:34:24.477 --> 02:34:32.564]  Well, he's a graduate of the Defense Language School and been out at Fort Bragg, and she was excited when she saw Tim Kennedy, the famous Green Beret in here.
[02:34:32.564 --> 02:34:42.352]  Beyond that, that guy has been, I'm not allowed to say the stuff he's been part of, but the most elite Army units there are, and I actually know folks that separately know him, and they go, you know that guy killed Zakari?
[02:34:42.972 --> 02:34:45.054]  You know, with basically his bare hands, all sorts of stuff.
[02:34:45.054 --> 02:34:47.075]  But, you know, Biggs is a really great guy, too.
[02:34:47.075 --> 02:34:57.943]  He's famous for, when press was with him, these Al-Qaeda guys were shooting RPGs at him, and they ran out of, you know, machine gun bullets, and Biggs literally crawled over the rock, jumped over, and stabbed the guy right in the neck.
[02:34:57.943 --> 02:34:58.584]  That's kind of cool.
[02:34:58.584 --> 02:35:02.606]  I mean, I'm not saying it's cool to kill people, but it's just cool these type of, you know, folks that can do stuff like this.
[02:35:02.606 --> 02:35:03.887]  It's pretty neat.
[02:35:03.887 --> 02:35:05.509]  But I'm digressing off into all that.
[02:35:06.328 --> 02:35:11.511]  We're going to be discussing it in great detail in upcoming films and more.
[02:35:11.511 --> 02:35:15.914]  What is happening domestically here in the United States, mirroring what's happening overseas.
[02:35:15.914 --> 02:35:19.336]  But before I go any further, Liver Shield is back in stock.
[02:35:19.336 --> 02:35:31.164]  And this is concentrated, known organic herbs that are designed to just make your liver basically relax, gallbladder relax, and just let everything out.
[02:35:31.164 --> 02:35:34.006]  But you cannot drink the seven days you're on it.
[02:35:34.006 --> 02:35:34.286]  Okay?
[02:35:34.286 --> 02:35:35.607]  Because it opens your liver wide open.
[02:35:37.074 --> 02:35:41.377]  And it's got, what is it, 4.8 star reviews?
[02:35:41.377 --> 02:35:41.877]  Or is that 4.3?
[02:35:41.877 --> 02:35:42.798]  I can't read.
[02:35:42.798 --> 02:35:46.160]  But thousands of five star reviews, 4.6.
[02:35:46.160 --> 02:35:47.901]  That's with Power Reviews.
[02:35:47.901 --> 02:35:49.562]  Nobody else in Nutraceuticals has that.
[02:35:49.562 --> 02:35:51.103]  This is the very best.
[02:35:51.103 --> 02:35:54.226]  That's why it sells out all the time, because we have trouble getting the organic
[02:35:55.146 --> 02:35:59.728]  Shilajit from the Himalayas and other key ingredients.
[02:35:59.728 --> 02:36:17.354]  You take the oxy powder with it, the apple cider vinegar and water for six days, four to eight pills a day with the liver shield in the water, and then you take eight ounces of virgin olive oil, lay on your side the seventh night, and we've got informational videos, you name it, and people cannot believe it.
[02:36:17.354 --> 02:36:21.096]  It's why, if we could keep it in stock, it would be our best seller times two.
[02:36:22.356 --> 02:36:26.357]  Because these herbs are so hard to get, this is not an artificial scarcity pitch.
[02:36:26.357 --> 02:36:31.498]  People know it's been gone two months, and it's going to sell out in like a week at current sales rates.
[02:36:31.498 --> 02:36:33.359]  So check out what it's done for others.
[02:36:33.359 --> 02:36:35.219]  See the information for yourself.
[02:36:35.219 --> 02:36:36.060]  It is incredible.
[02:36:36.060 --> 02:36:36.960]  It's a six-day cleanse.
[02:36:36.960 --> 02:36:38.120]  I went for seven.
[02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:39.000]  Some folks gave it longer.
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:40.421]  You should do three a year according to Dr. Groob.
[02:36:41.521 --> 02:36:45.944]  It is the number one rated, advanced liver cleanse, packed with liver shield and oxy powder.
[02:36:45.944 --> 02:36:47.025]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:36:47.025 --> 02:36:47.905]  All supplies last.
[02:36:47.905 --> 02:36:51.247]  Super Mill Vitality will sell out today, unless you're signed up for auto ship.
[02:36:51.247 --> 02:36:52.588]  We're holding some back there.
[02:36:52.588 --> 02:36:54.129]  Super Female is still available.
[02:36:54.129 --> 02:36:56.290]  That sold out quicker than we thought it would.
[02:36:56.290 --> 02:36:59.092]  AndroPlex has sold out, except for folks that are on
[02:37:00.052 --> 02:37:00.612]  I don't think so.
[02:37:19.083 --> 02:37:25.707]  In DNA Force, comparable nutraceuticals you get from doctors are $600, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:37:25.707 --> 02:37:29.049]  So you will not find what's in this out there in our experience for a lower price.
[02:37:29.049 --> 02:37:40.456]  I mean, a third the amount of DNA Force that is in a serving of this, of the BioPQQ, with leading competitors like $60 a bottle just for the BioPQQ and there's less of it.
[02:37:40.456 --> 02:37:43.438]  And then a lot of times it's the synthetic BioPQQ.
[02:37:43.438 --> 02:37:44.559]  The point is we have to like,
[02:37:45.459 --> 02:37:48.923]  Jump through hoops to even get this, and people say, you're not a medical facility?
[02:37:48.923 --> 02:37:50.745]  This is what they sell in Switzerland and Germany.
[02:37:50.745 --> 02:37:52.106]  People don't buy this.
[02:37:52.106 --> 02:37:58.173]  Because you go to these medical doctors, the reason we had these ideas a few years ago, and you notice, they have the expensive nutraceuticals, but no one would sell them in stores.
[02:37:58.173 --> 02:38:00.955]  We went, well if this stuff isn't prescription, we're gonna sell it.
[02:38:01.596 --> 02:38:03.578]  And that's what we do, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:03.578 --> 02:38:08.643]  Now, some of this stuff, they're trying to make prescriptions soon, so check it out today.
[02:38:08.643 --> 02:38:13.468]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:38:13.468 --> 02:38:24.139]  And I'm kind of glad, this is not a light topic, but seeing my old buddy Kevin makes me in a better mood, because there really is earth-shaking stuff going on, really, really crazy stuff going on, and
[02:38:25.666 --> 02:38:27.287]  Big Mike, think of it this way.
[02:38:27.287 --> 02:38:34.292]  Again, you're the biggest maker of fertilizers, organic fertilizers used not just for marijuana and hemp, but other plants.
[02:38:34.292 --> 02:38:36.073]  But when it comes to marijuana, you're the biggest.
[02:38:36.073 --> 02:38:40.336]  AdvancedNutrients.com expanding on this.
[02:38:40.336 --> 02:38:44.139]  If you were on national TV for five minutes, which you are, the dinosaur media is dying.
[02:38:45.179 --> 02:38:48.402]  There's probably 3 million people listening and watching just right now in this 15 minutes.
[02:38:48.402 --> 02:38:51.464]  That's the average time spent listening or watching is about 17 minutes.
[02:38:51.464 --> 02:39:00.732]  What is your main transmission for folks to know about the world, the film you're financing, Ghost Nation, and then introduce your colleague here to the folks that are watching and listening.
[02:39:00.732 --> 02:39:03.975]  Well, I'm a CEO of an international company.
[02:39:03.975 --> 02:39:05.296]  I'm an angel investor.
[02:39:05.296 --> 02:39:12.843]  I am also a political activist and
[02:39:15.140 --> 02:39:19.926]  I'm passionate about, and I'm a philanthropist, and I'm just passionate about what I do.
[02:39:19.926 --> 02:39:22.269]  I love the cannabis plant.
[02:39:22.269 --> 02:39:24.212]  I've had a love affair with it.
[02:39:24.212 --> 02:39:25.994]  I've been doing it for 33 years growing.
[02:39:25.994 --> 02:39:29.038]  And it hadn't stopped you from working 15 hours a day and being successful?
[02:39:29.038 --> 02:39:29.479]  That's right.
[02:39:29.479 --> 02:39:31.161]  And that's a whole other topic.
[02:39:31.161 --> 02:39:31.741]  People think like...
[02:39:32.282 --> 02:39:37.425]  There's an easy button out there and they think, oh, cannabis guys, they just like, they're growing a weed and they're sticking to the ground.
[02:39:37.425 --> 02:39:43.309]  Let me tell you, it's the hardest work I ever did when I was growing outdoors and indoors.
[02:39:43.309 --> 02:39:44.570]  It's a lot of work.
[02:39:44.570 --> 02:39:46.291]  It's very manual.
[02:39:46.291 --> 02:39:58.880]  But I've had a love of the plant and I've studied it, researched it, and our line of nutrients will take a cannabis plant and bring it to its true genetic potential, at least the best way that
[02:39:59.761 --> 02:40:00.621]  I know possible.
[02:40:00.621 --> 02:40:04.983]  I know so many troops, and I keep going, who never liked marijuana.
[02:40:04.983 --> 02:40:08.465]  Super conservative guys, but Prozac doesn't work.
[02:40:08.465 --> 02:40:10.726]  Stuff doesn't work from the five, six tours they've been on.
[02:40:10.726 --> 02:40:12.366]  They have anxiety attacks.
[02:40:12.366 --> 02:40:19.249]  They wake up, you know, and grab their gun at 3 a.m., you know, with flashbacks, and they go, look, I just smoked marijuana once a day at night.
[02:40:19.249 --> 02:40:20.550]  I don't drink as much anymore.
[02:40:20.550 --> 02:40:21.510]  It works great.
[02:40:21.510 --> 02:40:22.891]  And it's got that effect.
[02:40:22.891 --> 02:40:26.212]  Sure, it can be damaging, but it's just something else God gave us.
[02:40:26.212 --> 02:40:27.813]  I'm so sick of this, hating it.
[02:40:28.413 --> 02:40:30.854]  Personally, and Kevin knows this, I'm not a big marijuana guy.
[02:40:30.854 --> 02:40:31.555]  No.
[02:40:31.555 --> 02:40:37.258]  Because, I mean, I don't care whether it's the two different types, whatever it is, my brain's already going too fast, it doesn't have a calming effect on me.
[02:40:37.258 --> 02:40:38.479]  Yeah, it doesn't match everybody's paranoia.
[02:40:38.479 --> 02:40:39.760]  I get really paranoid.
[02:40:39.760 --> 02:40:42.161]  Well, it also depends on the strain that you're smoking.
[02:40:42.161 --> 02:40:42.882]  Here's what people don't believe.
[02:40:42.882 --> 02:40:44.002]  Oh, it's sativa and indica.
[02:40:44.002 --> 02:40:48.105]  Right, so they say sativa will give you up and indica will get you low.
[02:40:48.105 --> 02:40:50.086]  We'll take you down, but what's more important
[02:40:50.606 --> 02:40:52.247]  This is what you're going to see in the future.
[02:40:52.247 --> 02:40:58.712]  You're going to see a cannabinoid profile, but just as important is terpenes, because the terpenes modulate the cannabinoids.
[02:40:58.712 --> 02:41:03.716]  That's why the synthetic doesn't work, because it's not the whole plant extract.
[02:41:03.716 --> 02:41:05.558]  And they have to work with whole plant extracts.
[02:41:05.558 --> 02:41:11.082]  That's why all of our products are cold pressed, because it kills it and you don't upload it unless it's cold pressed.
[02:41:11.550 --> 02:41:13.051]  By the way, cold press is excellent.
[02:41:13.051 --> 02:41:15.772]  Like, if you cold press, you're rocking the house, dude.
[02:41:15.772 --> 02:41:16.272]  That's good.
[02:41:16.272 --> 02:41:17.032]  We do cold press.
[02:41:17.032 --> 02:41:19.973]  We're some of the only people that cold press herbs.
[02:41:19.973 --> 02:41:24.515]  And there's no alcohol to... We cold press it to a pure oil.
[02:41:24.515 --> 02:41:28.836]  I'm not talking about... That'll be evil that I cold press herbs and so on, but we're kind of in the same line.
[02:41:28.836 --> 02:41:30.237]  These are plants God gave us.
[02:41:31.323 --> 02:41:32.663]  Absolutely is.
[02:41:32.663 --> 02:41:36.184]  And what people don't realize is our body is wired for weed.
[02:41:36.184 --> 02:41:39.385]  We have what's called an endocannabinoid system.
[02:41:39.385 --> 02:41:48.367]  And two studies just came out of, a study came out of Germany from Hamburg University and Heidelberg University that said runner's high is not endorphins.
[02:41:48.367 --> 02:41:52.687]  It is the endocannabinoid system releasing cannabinoids into our body.
[02:41:56.810 --> 02:42:00.374]  Once you hit that 20th wind sprint, you get high, that does feel like marijuana.
[02:42:00.374 --> 02:42:00.875]  Go ahead.
[02:42:00.875 --> 02:42:01.775]  Yeah, it is.
[02:42:01.775 --> 02:42:07.321]  And so what runners high, what they're really feeling is the endocannabinoid system working to take away the pain.
[02:42:07.321 --> 02:42:09.183]  We're wired for weed.
[02:42:09.183 --> 02:42:12.807]  Look, Chinese medicine, they've been using this plant for 5,000 years.
[02:42:12.807 --> 02:42:14.008]  It's there.
[02:42:14.008 --> 02:42:16.091]  It's there for us to use responsibly.
[02:42:16.091 --> 02:42:16.992]  Is it legal in China?
[02:42:17.845 --> 02:42:18.246]  No.
[02:42:18.246 --> 02:42:18.787]  God no.
[02:42:18.787 --> 02:42:21.210]  Like, no drugs are, like, that's death penalty.
[02:42:21.210 --> 02:42:22.652]  They're radical there.
[02:42:22.652 --> 02:42:26.518]  That's the most, I think they're even probably more radical than Islam is, you know, when it comes to that.
[02:42:26.518 --> 02:42:26.818]  I don't know.
[02:42:26.818 --> 02:42:27.359]  Well, you know why?
[02:42:27.359 --> 02:42:29.242]  Because the British use the whole drug thing to take them over.
[02:42:29.957 --> 02:42:30.698]  Well, the opium wars.
[02:42:30.698 --> 02:42:31.439]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:42:31.439 --> 02:42:32.099]  You know your stuff.
[02:42:32.099 --> 02:42:33.581]  You say you're not political, you're historical.
[02:42:33.581 --> 02:42:34.662]  No, no, I don't believe it.
[02:42:34.662 --> 02:42:35.243]  Well, keep going.
[02:42:35.243 --> 02:42:36.564]  Keep telling us your breakdown.
[02:42:36.564 --> 02:42:38.947]  Then we're going to go to your guest.
[02:42:38.947 --> 02:42:39.127]  Oh.
[02:42:39.127 --> 02:42:42.791]  So, anyway, so I've had this little affair with a plant.
[02:42:42.791 --> 02:42:44.373]  Obviously the war on drugs doesn't work.
[02:42:44.373 --> 02:42:45.895]  We spent a lot of money.
[02:42:45.895 --> 02:42:48.478]  I believe that it was perpetuated by the industrial military.
[02:42:48.478 --> 02:42:49.999]  Not the industrial military, the industrial
[02:42:50.660 --> 02:43:00.284]  Prison complex and now the truth has come out and the genie's out of the bottle and it's not going to go back at all.
[02:43:00.284 --> 02:43:03.865]  And I know this because there's two sides of this equation.
[02:43:03.865 --> 02:43:08.147]  There's what I call our community and then there's the investors who are coming in.
[02:43:08.687 --> 02:43:09.768]  And it's a mixture of both.
[02:43:09.768 --> 02:43:13.069]  But some of the investors are some of the biggest donors to political campaigns.
[02:43:13.069 --> 02:43:20.092]  Are you going to tell some guy, oh, that $10 million, $20 million investment that you made, I'm sorry, but I got to vote against that?
[02:43:20.092 --> 02:43:21.212]  That's not going to happen.
[02:43:21.212 --> 02:43:23.914]  So in one way, this kind of thing is good.
[02:43:23.914 --> 02:43:27.015]  It ensures the future of medical marijuana.
[02:43:27.655 --> 02:43:33.741]  Yeah, but then the other way is you got these guys coming in here who just, it's purely for profit.
[02:43:33.741 --> 02:43:35.462]  There's nothing wrong with profit.
[02:43:35.462 --> 02:43:37.064]  You need profit to do all kinds of things.
[02:43:37.064 --> 02:43:39.286]  I couldn't make the movie that we're doing now.
[02:43:39.286 --> 02:43:43.630]  But you've got to make profit morally with something that helps people in my view.
[02:43:43.630 --> 02:43:45.111]  I agree.
[02:43:45.111 --> 02:43:48.474]  I feel so good getting up every morning and doing what I do.
[02:43:48.474 --> 02:43:51.257]  Well, one reason you've dominated and are getting bigger and bigger is
[02:43:52.538 --> 02:43:54.919]  I've been reading the trade publications about you this weekend before you came in.
[02:43:54.919 --> 02:44:07.346]  I knew who you were before, but I kind of did a closer look, is I went to some of the biggest organic manufacturers of vitamins and minerals and supplements in the last four or five years, because I already had a bunch of sponsors that were great, but I was like, why don't I just do this myself?
[02:44:07.346 --> 02:44:10.147]  And they go, we wish we had people like you.
[02:44:10.147 --> 02:44:17.170]  No one wants to actually put this into a product where the bottle costs $10, you know, the product, and you sell it for $20, you still make a profit.
[02:44:17.170 --> 02:44:19.712]  Or it costs $18, you sell it for $40.
[02:44:19.712 --> 02:44:21.453]  We're still making a profit to fund our operation.
[02:44:21.453 --> 02:44:21.853]  We need it.
[02:44:23.459 --> 02:44:28.142]  They say people put $2 a product in and then sell it for $50 with fancy marketing.
[02:44:28.142 --> 02:44:34.287]  Just as a business guy, if I was a sociopath, I would want to sell something that works so good, they'd want to come back to me.
[02:44:34.287 --> 02:44:38.250]  I don't understand where you put it into marketing, but not into what it really does.
[02:44:38.250 --> 02:44:43.474]  Why don't I sell something that blows somebody away and helps them, and then helps me, and then they're totally hooked.
[02:44:43.474 --> 02:44:44.674]  I mean, doing the right thing.
[02:44:45.615 --> 02:44:51.578]  Even midterm is always best, but they teach the general public, screw somebody over today, win quick.
[02:44:51.578 --> 02:44:53.939]  That's not how the world got built.
[02:44:53.939 --> 02:44:54.639]  You can't do it.
[02:44:54.639 --> 02:44:56.520]  I mean, our company's been around for 16 years.
[02:44:56.520 --> 02:45:00.942]  We're in our eighth generation of nutrients that we're working on.
[02:45:00.942 --> 02:45:02.283]  And I've never cut corners.
[02:45:02.283 --> 02:45:04.964]  And I've had my CFOs go like, what the hell are you doing?
[02:45:04.964 --> 02:45:07.085]  I go, no, this is where it's going to be.
[02:45:07.085 --> 02:45:11.707]  And there's some products that my margins are so low, it should sell for three times the amount.
[02:45:11.707 --> 02:45:12.147]  What about this?
[02:45:13.348 --> 02:45:18.032]  Get an ingredient, and then your people are so religious about it, they're like, no, we just won't have it.
[02:45:18.032 --> 02:45:22.836]  And then we have to wait until we get it, or change the formulation, because we're that neurotic.
[02:45:22.836 --> 02:45:24.377]  I mean... Oh yeah.
[02:45:24.377 --> 02:45:29.842]  And when you spend a lot of money, what happens eventually, if it picks up, is you get economies of scale.
[02:45:29.842 --> 02:45:30.302]  Sometimes.
[02:45:30.302 --> 02:45:30.843]  Sometimes you don't.
[02:45:30.843 --> 02:45:33.385]  Suddenly you get it exactly, and then better deals open up.
[02:45:33.385 --> 02:45:36.908]  I think one of the ironies of the drug war is that it has created guys like Big Mike.
[02:45:37.168 --> 02:45:38.810]  Because of the drug war.
[02:45:38.810 --> 02:45:44.838]  If it wasn't for the drug war, you wouldn't have this incredible science and all these people so passionate about growing great marijuana.
[02:45:44.838 --> 02:45:52.828]  I mean, the drug warriors have actually created their own worst nightmare, which I think is the ultimate... Well, for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[02:45:52.828 --> 02:45:53.589]  You just said it.
[02:45:53.589 --> 02:45:54.430]  Introduce me to this guy.
[02:45:55.157 --> 02:46:11.799]  This guy, listen, I was in Bulgaria and I met this guy, I was introduced through a friend, and him and his brother, he's Scrim, and I talked to these guys for a while and I go, this dude's like really smart, and I come out and find out he's a member of Mensa and
[02:46:12.740 --> 02:46:16.541]  He's like the smartest computer guy I've ever met in my life.
[02:46:16.541 --> 02:46:23.783]  And he's politically passionate in a country where I didn't know top from bottom in the beginning.
[02:46:23.783 --> 02:46:33.166]  And he has been instrumental in leading me through the landmines and avoiding them and pointing me in the right direction, all of us in the right direction.
[02:46:33.166 --> 02:46:35.226]  And his name is Ivan.
[02:46:35.226 --> 02:46:37.147]  Here we call him Ivan.
[02:46:37.147 --> 02:46:38.227]  So this is Ivan.
[02:46:38.227 --> 02:46:39.327]  And he's been your guide.
[02:46:39.327 --> 02:46:41.248]  He's been your guide in Bulgaria.
[02:46:41.488 --> 02:46:42.349]  Not just a guy.
[02:46:42.349 --> 02:46:44.951]  Like, no, this guy is beyond a guy.
[02:46:44.951 --> 02:46:48.633]  He's a passionate warrior to change the government.
[02:46:48.633 --> 02:46:50.775]  He was your inspiration, for a great extent.
[02:46:50.775 --> 02:46:53.097]  Oh, we were wrong.
[02:46:53.097 --> 02:46:59.642]  Alright, so give us the 3-4 minute spiel up front about what's really happening in Eastern Europe, what's happening in Bulgaria.
[02:46:59.642 --> 02:47:00.863]  I mean, who are the factions?
[02:47:00.863 --> 02:47:02.104]  What was it like growing up there?
[02:47:02.104 --> 02:47:03.705]  I mean, he spent his whole life there.
[02:47:04.165 --> 02:47:10.110]  I'm one of the few people that actually left, just didn't leave the country.
[02:47:10.110 --> 02:47:11.771]  So I was feeling really bad.
[02:47:11.771 --> 02:47:15.454]  I mean, all the guys my age and girls left.
[02:47:15.454 --> 02:47:19.957]  So it's becoming worse and worse and worse and worse.
[02:47:19.957 --> 02:47:26.002]  So I was a completely non-political guy up until five, six years ago.
[02:47:26.002 --> 02:47:26.843]  Then I just saw that
[02:47:27.683 --> 02:47:31.166]  The problem is not the people, it's not the country, it's the ruling class.
[02:47:31.166 --> 02:47:36.670]  The guys that are actually, how do you say it, do you say it, left behind network or something like that?
[02:47:36.670 --> 02:47:37.770]  Stay behind network.
[02:47:37.770 --> 02:47:38.251]  Yeah.
[02:47:38.251 --> 02:47:44.976]  So they are the drivers, the thugs and the security guys of the former communist leaders.
[02:47:44.976 --> 02:47:46.056]  Our prime minister is a...
[02:47:46.917 --> 02:47:47.617]  Who are the factions?
[02:47:47.617 --> 02:47:49.198]  I mean, is it the Russians?
[02:48:09.784 --> 02:48:11.968]  I mean, the Russians have been closed there for 80 years.
[02:48:20.177 --> 02:48:26.779]  Islam, we have, everybody, I mean, everything that has a benefit there, or a profit, goes in.
[02:48:26.779 --> 02:48:30.360]  And because the government's weak, they're like, so corrupt.
[02:48:30.360 --> 02:48:36.462]  From my research, I mean, we know the Russians, they're their influence, Russian Mafia, but is the Islamic threat growing?
[02:48:36.462 --> 02:48:39.863]  It is, I mean, it's something that actually needs to be controlled.
[02:48:39.863 --> 02:48:42.004]  Are they sweet and loving to you once you give in to them?
[02:48:43.320 --> 02:48:48.741]  I don't really know, I mean, I don't have experience in that stuff, but you can actually see it.
[02:48:48.741 --> 02:48:54.083]  And there are a lot of decent people coming in, running from the conflict as well, so it's a mix.
[02:48:54.083 --> 02:48:55.483]  There are bad guys, there are good guys.
[02:48:55.483 --> 02:48:58.004]  Yeah, but then the bad guys use those communities as their base.
[02:48:58.004 --> 02:48:58.884]  Of course.
[02:48:58.884 --> 02:49:00.444]  Of course, and it's a usual thing.
[02:49:00.444 --> 02:49:09.226]  You just, you have the isolation, you have the scared people, you have people, all my people are just, most of Bulgarians are just trying to avoid them.
[02:49:09.226 --> 02:49:11.627]  So you have this isolation that you can hide in.
[02:49:11.707 --> 02:49:12.207]  And that's it.
[02:49:12.207 --> 02:49:17.091]  People are in denial in Europe and Eastern Europe about the invasion, which is making it even worse.
[02:49:17.091 --> 02:49:19.053]  People just want to, whoa, I don't see that.
[02:49:19.053 --> 02:49:22.135]  Yeah, I mean, they need to do something.
[02:49:22.135 --> 02:49:23.856]  I mean, it's like getting out of control.
[02:49:25.775 --> 02:49:26.735]  I'm a normal guy.
[02:49:26.735 --> 02:49:28.216]  I mean, I know what's wrong.
[02:49:28.216 --> 02:49:29.196]  I know how to fix it.
[02:49:29.196 --> 02:49:35.138]  We created a system for electronic voting and the government didn't want it because they're dead.
[02:49:35.138 --> 02:49:37.979]  Because they fake all the elections completely.
[02:49:37.979 --> 02:49:39.959]  And by the way, this was Pentagon-level security.
[02:49:39.959 --> 02:49:42.520]  It was an unbreakable platform.
[02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:45.201]  And when we ran in the last election, our
[02:49:46.141 --> 02:49:49.423]  Our polls indicated we had between 11 and 12 percent of the vote.
[02:49:49.423 --> 02:49:51.684]  You're running a political party.
[02:49:51.684 --> 02:49:55.766]  Oh yeah, so we started a political movement, and that political movement turned into a political party.
[02:49:55.766 --> 02:49:58.808]  They backed the head of the guy that... No, I know, I should have said that up front.
[02:49:58.808 --> 02:50:02.270]  And that's why when Kevin told me this like a year ago, I go, oh, these people are CIA?
[02:50:02.270 --> 02:50:03.170]  Are they George Soros?
[02:50:03.170 --> 02:50:06.832]  Well, listen, a lot of times, though, I'm not saying you are, and I don't think you are.
[02:50:06.832 --> 02:50:10.534]  The point is, is that obviously you haven't been approached by the State Department.
[02:50:11.269 --> 02:50:11.889]  No, I have not.
[02:50:11.889 --> 02:50:23.275]  And I actually wish they would come to me and go, hey, like, okay, what you're doing, we understand it's a good thing, and give us some funding so we can get the right people elected in that country.
[02:50:23.275 --> 02:50:24.516]  Well, I think you're legitimate.
[02:50:24.516 --> 02:50:28.398]  I mean, I come off that you're a real entrepreneur, you really are doing this for the right reasons.
[02:50:28.398 --> 02:50:33.921]  You've got to know, though, it's a good thing you do have a bunch of security, because if you actually get this going, the Russians are going to come after you.
[02:50:34.776 --> 02:50:46.525]  I've already been threatened, but, and I've been offered, here's the thing, I've had the two major parties in Bulgaria come and offer me all the marijuana business if the party that I started with... I forgot that, I should have started this at the front.
[02:50:46.525 --> 02:50:46.986]  Yeah, right.
[02:50:46.986 --> 02:50:51.830]  You've been offered all the marijuana business in the country, a monopoly if you'll play ball with them.
[02:50:51.830 --> 02:50:53.431]  Right, and because I'm a marijuana guy, that's my agenda.
[02:50:53.431 --> 02:50:54.692]  I tell them, absolutely not.
[02:50:54.692 --> 02:50:55.392]  That's not what I work for.
[02:50:55.392 --> 02:50:57.414]  Stay right there, we're gonna come right back with Big Mike, I'm Alex Jones.

[02:53:55.140 --> 02:54:05.347]  IDStronghold.com Big Mike's our guest.
[02:54:05.347 --> 02:54:06.708]  Kevin Booth as well.
[02:54:06.708 --> 02:54:08.630]  You want hardcore news?
[02:54:08.630 --> 02:54:14.294]  We've got Paul Watson coming up loaded for bear hosting 50-something minutes of the fourth hour.
[02:54:14.294 --> 02:54:16.355]  I'll go five minutes the next hour with our guest.
[02:54:16.355 --> 02:54:18.497]  You say some powerful stuff during the breaks, bro.
[02:54:18.497 --> 02:54:20.298]  You were just talking up Donald Trump, Big Mike.
[02:54:20.698 --> 02:54:26.081]  Right, I look at all the candidates, who's out there, who's for medical marijuana, who's not.
[02:54:26.081 --> 02:54:31.503]  Hillary clearly isn't, you know, she's kind of waiting to see what the populace says.
[02:54:31.503 --> 02:54:32.864]  I don't like that kind of position.
[02:54:32.864 --> 02:54:33.644]  I like Trump.
[02:54:33.644 --> 02:54:36.105]  Trump said in 1990 all drugs should be legal.
[02:54:36.105 --> 02:54:36.726]  He supports
[02:54:37.486 --> 02:54:41.769]  Medical marijuana for the states, and even legalization at the state level.
[02:54:41.769 --> 02:54:43.530]  He's a businessman.
[02:54:43.530 --> 02:54:51.616]  He's great at playing the media, obviously, but I hope that it will be a runoff between Hillary and Trump, and I hope Trump wins.
[02:54:51.616 --> 02:54:55.979]  But Hillary's got one hell of a political machine.
[02:54:55.979 --> 02:54:57.360]  And she will steal elections.
[02:54:57.360 --> 02:55:00.282]  She's been stealing from Bernie Sanders in plain view.
[02:55:00.282 --> 02:55:02.023]  He wins New Hampshire, she gets the delegates.
[02:55:02.844 --> 02:55:05.024]  Because she said so.
[02:55:05.024 --> 02:55:06.925]  That sounds like what you're talking about with your elections.
[02:55:06.925 --> 02:55:09.605]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:55:09.605 --> 02:55:11.486]  You guys were getting into the election over there, so what happened?
[02:55:11.486 --> 02:55:14.106]  You were saying the night of the election, what happened?
[02:55:14.106 --> 02:55:22.188]  Oh, so the day of the election came, and we ended up with .401% of the vote.
[02:55:22.188 --> 02:55:23.568]  But guess who counts the votes?
[02:55:23.568 --> 02:55:25.609]  The top four political parties.
[02:55:25.609 --> 02:55:27.429]  That's like letting the fox guard the hen house.
[02:55:28.303 --> 02:55:29.504]  Like, what's going on here?
[02:55:29.504 --> 02:55:31.885]  And no one, EU, could simply step in.
[02:55:31.885 --> 02:55:33.706]  They said, well, we have observers.
[02:55:33.706 --> 02:55:36.727]  Well, there's 11,000 polling stations, they sent 200 people there.
[02:55:36.727 --> 02:55:38.248]  Like, really?
[02:55:38.248 --> 02:55:48.973]  And when we were there, they actually, the political parties, were starting to fight over who gets the votes from the other parties, and it was a big to-do, and we had a big press, we just walked out in the middle of the Congress party.
[02:55:48.973 --> 02:55:51.394]  You have a bunch of footage of this, right?
[02:55:51.394 --> 02:55:55.375]  We walked out, and the media came, and we're surrounded by cameras.
[02:55:56.736 --> 02:56:00.437]  Not one second of that made it to the news.
[02:56:00.437 --> 02:56:01.257]  It was censored.
[02:56:01.257 --> 02:56:01.977]  It was censored.
[02:56:01.977 --> 02:56:05.238]  Yeah, this is really where the story started.
[02:56:05.238 --> 02:56:13.761]  What do you guys think is going to end up happening in the Middle East with this proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia with Russia in the middle of it?
[02:56:13.761 --> 02:56:24.184]  You know, I, first off, America needs a strong leader who's not going to take what's happening to us, what Putin's doing, and push back.
[02:56:26.192 --> 02:56:30.614]  They need to just get stronger on their stance with Russia and Putin.
[02:56:30.614 --> 02:56:34.616]  I mean, the guy is obviously, like he's a rabid mad dog.
[02:56:34.616 --> 02:56:36.737]  And they're allowing him to run around.
[02:56:36.737 --> 02:56:37.857]  But see, I don't get it.
[02:56:37.857 --> 02:56:40.038]  I agree Russia has corruption and problems.
[02:56:40.038 --> 02:56:42.840]  But you're just talking about Al Qaeda doing all these horrible things and ISIS.
[02:56:42.840 --> 02:56:44.801]  Putin's fighting them.
[02:56:44.801 --> 02:56:46.682]  Oh yeah, I understand that.
[02:56:46.682 --> 02:56:47.202]  Yeah.
[02:56:47.202 --> 02:56:49.683]  I mean, even Trump says, hey, we should just leave them alone in Syria.
[02:56:50.714 --> 02:56:56.642]  Look, just because he's fighting ISIS on one front doesn't make him a good guy.
[02:56:56.642 --> 02:56:57.964]  What is his endgame?
[02:56:57.964 --> 02:57:00.287]  What is his agenda?
[02:57:00.287 --> 02:57:01.669]  That's what's really important.
[02:57:01.669 --> 02:57:02.951]  Control of the Middle East, maybe?
[02:57:02.951 --> 02:57:03.932]  Control of oil?
[02:57:03.932 --> 02:57:04.313]  I don't know.
[02:57:06.152 --> 02:57:10.775]  Well, I'd like them to turn loose all this new energy and things they have and just get rid of oil.
[02:57:10.775 --> 02:57:15.178]  Well, you know, here's the big thing in what's happening in Bulgaria.
[02:57:15.178 --> 02:57:19.021]  They run, the Russians supply energy to Bulgaria.
[02:57:19.021 --> 02:57:22.523]  And they have to pay 30% higher than they sell that energy to other countries.
[02:57:22.523 --> 02:57:23.144]  Why?
[02:57:23.144 --> 02:57:28.968]  Because some politician in Bulgaria made a deal, payola was paid out, and they got to recoup that loss.
[02:57:30.345 --> 02:57:35.207]  It's very... Bulgaria has enough energy and resources to be energy independent, right?
[02:57:35.207 --> 02:57:41.670]  From the perspective of Eastern Europeans that have had Russia sitting on them for 60, 70 years, you're sick of them.
[02:57:41.670 --> 02:57:42.651]  Well, no.
[02:57:42.651 --> 02:57:45.672]  Yeah, not only am I sick of them, but here's Putin's play.
[02:57:45.672 --> 02:57:55.477]  Putin's play is about energy and selling their resources and shoving it down people's throats, rather than being in a competitive marketplace.
[02:57:55.477 --> 02:57:59.059]  And being able to be in a competitive marketplace and let
[02:58:03.444 --> 02:58:08.611]  Well, he's getting hammered right now because the Saudis and others have lowered oil prices to bankrupt Russia.
[02:58:08.611 --> 02:58:09.212]  So my point is...
[02:58:11.115 --> 02:58:12.416]  That will change though.
[02:58:12.416 --> 02:58:13.557]  That will go back up.
[02:58:13.557 --> 02:58:14.378]  Like always.
[02:58:40.555 --> 02:58:40.855]  70 seconds.
[02:58:40.855 --> 02:58:48.360]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:48.360 --> 02:58:53.023]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[02:58:53.023 --> 02:58:57.766]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[02:58:57.766 --> 02:58:59.107]  Talk about the effects.
[02:58:59.107 --> 02:59:00.627]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[02:59:00.627 --> 02:59:02.549]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[02:59:02.549 --> 02:59:03.669]  I feel like I look better.
[02:59:03.669 --> 02:59:04.370]  I feel better.
[02:59:04.370 --> 02:59:05.771]  I feel sexier.
[02:59:05.771 --> 02:59:06.151]  I love it.
[02:59:06.391 --> 02:59:14.558]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge, get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female, check it out for yourself, consult your physician.

[02:59:16.940 --> 02:59:18.261]  This is life-changing.
[02:59:18.261 --> 02:59:19.162]  Shower filters.
[02:59:19.162 --> 02:59:20.783]  We're introducing the best yet.
[02:59:20.783 --> 02:59:24.967]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[02:59:24.967 --> 02:59:29.771]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[02:59:29.771 --> 02:59:31.933]  This new four-stage filtration process
[02:59:32.133 --> 02:59:33.494]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:59:59.761 --> 03:00:05.165]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:05.165 --> 03:00:07.386]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:00:24.733 --> 03:00:32.257]  Final segment with our guest, Big Mike from AdvancedNutrients.com, HolidayHeroes.bg forward slash EN.
[03:00:32.257 --> 03:00:36.639]  And you've been involved feeding over 20,000 needy people this past Christmas alone.
[03:00:36.639 --> 03:00:39.541]  You're also involved in charities, I guess, in Africa, all over the world.
[03:00:39.541 --> 03:00:41.542]  So I think that's really good that you're giving back, Big Mike.
[03:00:41.542 --> 03:00:44.664]  Let's talk to your friend here and condense it.
[03:00:44.664 --> 03:00:48.746]  Other points you want to make about your perspective about what's happening in Eastern Europe.
[03:00:50.129 --> 03:00:56.714]  I mean, I can speak about Bulgaria because apparently now Romania is ahead of us 10 years.
[03:00:56.714 --> 03:01:03.860]  The EU just stopped monitoring Romania, their judicial system, but they're continuing monitoring ours.
[03:01:03.860 --> 03:01:06.362]  So the problem is that there is no control.
[03:01:06.362 --> 03:01:08.283]  I mean, the corruption is so big.
[03:01:08.283 --> 03:01:15.789]  And the prosecutor's office and the judges, they're controlled by the government?
[03:01:16.542 --> 03:01:23.309]  Which is not democratic, because we need to... In democracy you have the separations of the three powers.
[03:01:23.309 --> 03:01:25.972]  So, this needs to change.
[03:01:25.972 --> 03:01:29.395]  I mean, people understand that now.
[03:01:29.395 --> 03:01:31.637]  And this actually helps...
[03:01:32.734 --> 03:01:33.995]  Everything else happening.
[03:01:33.995 --> 03:01:40.079]  I mean like the corruption going out of hand, just like the Russians do whatever they want.
[03:01:40.079 --> 03:01:43.201]  Everybody does, more or less, whatever they want.
[03:01:43.201 --> 03:01:52.527]  So I kind of reached the place where, if you recall, Marquis de Lafayette said, insurrection is the most indispensable of duties.
[03:01:52.527 --> 03:01:59.552]  To fight the government when the government violates your rights, insurrection is one of the most indispensable of duties.
[03:01:59.552 --> 03:02:01.853]  Well, Thomas Jefferson said that when the
[03:02:02.954 --> 03:02:04.595]  Government fears the people, there is liberty.
[03:02:04.595 --> 03:02:06.536]  When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[03:02:06.536 --> 03:02:09.877]  They're trying to expand the Patriot Act to just criticizing the government.
[03:02:09.877 --> 03:02:10.798]  They're going to come arrest you.
[03:02:10.798 --> 03:02:15.100]  In fact, I'm going to cover that when I come back with Paul Watson after you guys are gone briefly.
[03:02:15.100 --> 03:02:16.621]  And this just shows what they want to do here.
[03:02:16.621 --> 03:02:19.402]  But the answer is, don't get scared of that.
[03:02:19.402 --> 03:02:20.603]  Say no to that.
[03:02:20.603 --> 03:02:21.423]  Reach out.
[03:02:21.423 --> 03:02:23.764]  The government's full of good people as well.
[03:02:23.764 --> 03:02:26.185]  They want to say no to the special interests that are controlling our country.
[03:02:27.659 --> 03:02:31.400]  You guys have been, you know, fighting back against the Russian foot on your neck.
[03:02:31.400 --> 03:02:33.541]  Because that's what big powers do.
[03:02:33.541 --> 03:02:36.181]  Globalists are much bigger than Russia, much more powerful.
[03:02:36.181 --> 03:02:39.702]  They're coming in with totalitarianism, trying to take our freedoms as well.
[03:02:39.702 --> 03:02:42.183]  And so that's what I'm fighting.
[03:02:42.183 --> 03:02:43.944]  I get that.
[03:02:43.944 --> 03:02:45.364]  You say your brother's a listener?
[03:02:45.364 --> 03:02:46.244]  My brother's a listener.
[03:02:46.244 --> 03:02:47.405]  Well, say hi to him.
[03:02:47.405 --> 03:02:48.745]  John, how you doing, bro?
[03:02:50.806 --> 03:02:53.147]  Kevin Booth, so you don't know when the film's coming out?
[03:02:53.147 --> 03:02:53.467]  No.
[03:02:53.467 --> 03:02:53.927]  Ghost Nation.
[03:02:53.927 --> 03:02:56.728]  Yeah, I mean, hopefully we can be in film festivals by July.
[03:02:56.728 --> 03:02:59.329]  And the website is Sacred Possum?
[03:02:59.329 --> 03:03:00.950]  Sacredpossum.com.
[03:03:00.950 --> 03:03:01.270]  Alex.
[03:03:01.270 --> 03:03:02.030]  Who knows what that is?
[03:03:02.030 --> 03:03:05.191]  Well, we just bought a new domain for the film, right?
[03:03:05.191 --> 03:03:07.752]  I mean, Ghost Nation.
[03:03:07.752 --> 03:03:09.013]  That's not up yet, though.
[03:03:09.013 --> 03:03:16.835]  Yeah, not up yet, but you can always find me on americandrugwar.com, and I'll be doing a lecture at the University of Houston in Victoria tomorrow at noon.
[03:03:16.835 --> 03:03:17.976]  All right, are you guys going to that?
[03:03:19.229 --> 03:03:25.194]  No, we're actually going to be in class learning, if you can believe that, for a couple of days here.
[03:03:25.194 --> 03:03:27.416]  We're going to a mastermind group that we belong to.
[03:03:27.416 --> 03:03:28.537]  Oh, cool!
[03:03:28.537 --> 03:03:29.718]  Oh, that's awesome.
[03:03:29.718 --> 03:03:30.478]  In Austin?
[03:03:30.478 --> 03:03:31.459]  In Austin, yeah.
[03:03:31.459 --> 03:03:32.860]  You like Austin?
[03:03:32.860 --> 03:03:33.821]  Actually, I love Austin.
[03:03:33.821 --> 03:03:36.003]  It kind of reminds me of the Midwest where I grew up.
[03:03:36.003 --> 03:03:38.244]  It's nice, very nice.
[03:03:38.244 --> 03:03:42.628]  Yeah, the people are pretty nice, other than the allergies.
[03:03:42.628 --> 03:03:44.229]  What kind of jet are you guys flying here on?
[03:03:44.229 --> 03:03:44.790]  That was a Falcon 50.
[03:03:45.450 --> 03:03:46.311]  Oh, those are cool.
[03:03:46.311 --> 03:03:46.991]  That was a great one.
[03:03:46.991 --> 03:03:48.572]  I've flown around on those.
[03:03:48.572 --> 03:03:52.294]  Not myself, I'm going to pay for it, but I guess everybody out in L.A.
[03:03:52.294 --> 03:03:55.076]  has one of those, like their car.
[03:03:55.076 --> 03:03:56.157]  Man, it's like Star Wars.
[03:03:56.157 --> 03:04:04.261]  We're in the cockpit of those, you know, the crash seat or whatever it is, and you're flying out of a big city and planes are going... That's a better view than out the side window.
[03:04:04.261 --> 03:04:04.742]  Absolutely is.
[03:04:05.546 --> 03:04:09.013]  All right, well, I'll definitely have to come by and see you guys when I'm out there.
[03:04:09.013 --> 03:04:14.164]  I'm going to do a trip, like I said, to go see Chris Carter and a bunch of other folks out in Los Angeles.
[03:04:14.164 --> 03:04:16.348]  But I tell you, I like Austin better than Los Angeles.
[03:04:17.253 --> 03:04:17.693]  I do too.
[03:04:17.693 --> 03:04:21.335]  Like, I'm in Los Angeles because I have to be for the business.
[03:04:21.335 --> 03:04:26.136]  It's ground zero for media and marijuana right now.
[03:04:26.136 --> 03:04:28.097]  It's that the center of it.
[03:04:28.097 --> 03:04:31.899]  But if I had to raise a family, it would be Midwest or even Austin.
[03:04:31.899 --> 03:04:33.239]  In fact, I was talking to Kelly about that.
[03:04:33.239 --> 03:04:35.340]  Like, Austin would be a good choice.
[03:04:35.340 --> 03:04:36.560]  Oh, Kelly and a family!
[03:04:36.560 --> 03:04:37.321]  Kelly and a family.
[03:04:37.321 --> 03:04:38.361]  I'm in love with that girl.
[03:04:38.361 --> 03:04:40.422]  I think they've already cast the new Blade Runner.
[03:04:40.422 --> 03:04:43.583]  But man, if she doesn't get the part of Press, they cast it wrong.
[03:04:43.783 --> 03:04:44.524]  There you go.
[03:04:44.524 --> 03:04:45.764]  There you go.
[03:04:45.764 --> 03:04:46.325]  All right.
[03:04:46.325 --> 03:04:48.366]  Well, who's going to play Roy Batty?
[03:04:48.366 --> 03:04:49.067]  Thanks a lot, brother.
[03:04:49.067 --> 03:04:50.148]  Good to meet you, Big Mike.
[03:04:50.148 --> 03:04:50.708]  Great to meet you.
[03:04:50.708 --> 03:04:51.328]  You bet.
[03:04:51.328 --> 03:04:55.031]  And check out at Marijuana Don on Instagram.
[03:04:55.031 --> 03:04:56.552]  At Marijuana Don.
[03:04:56.552 --> 03:04:57.613]  It'll blow your mind.
[03:04:57.613 --> 03:04:58.073]  All right.
[03:04:58.073 --> 03:04:59.394]  Oh, that's your book.
[03:04:59.394 --> 03:05:04.658]  Out of the presidential race, the former Florida governor has dropped out of the 2016 White House race.
[03:05:04.978 --> 03:05:16.805]  After losing the South Carolina primary badly to billionaire Donald Trump, who secured a strong victory with nearly a third of the vote, Bush formally launched his campaign back in June, about six months after he announced he would run for top office.
[03:05:16.805 --> 03:05:23.709]  He was supported by the Right to Rise Political Action Committee, which had raised in excess of $100 million for his campaign launch.
[03:05:23.709 --> 03:05:30.653]  But no amount of money could save Bush, a dorky candidate who at one point actually begged the audience to please clap for him after his speech.
[03:05:30.913 --> 03:05:35.055]  It was hilariously thrown off the stage at another speech for going over his allotted time.
[03:05:35.055 --> 03:05:39.958]  People are simply tired of establishment candidates who want amnesty for illegals flooding into the country.
[03:05:39.958 --> 03:05:50.643]  It also didn't help that Bush blew off the idea of releasing the missing 28 pages from the 9-11 report, which were classified not because of national security, but because they reveal Saudi Arabia's involvement in the attacks.

[03:07:51.273 --> 03:07:57.295]  I'm Alex Jones for Super Mel Vitality and InfoWarsLife.com, and I salute you, our supporters!
[03:08:10.296 --> 03:08:12.957]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:08:12.957 --> 03:08:21.179]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:08:21.179 --> 03:08:33.842]  Well, in that last hour and a half interview, you really got a perspective on more Western, Eastern Europeans, but also further East, not liking being under the Soviet boot for so long.
[03:08:33.842 --> 03:08:37.183]  And I get from their perspective, it looks like a tyranny.
[03:08:38.561 --> 03:09:07.920]  But I look at things very cold-bloodedly, just geopolitically, about who's really making the moves, who's doing the most oppression, who puts cancer viruses in vaccines, who's trying to break up families, who's saying don't use the word mother and father, and the tyranny coming out of Brussels, Belgium, and New York City, and London, England, and Paris, France, and Berlin, Germany, makes the Russian tyranny look like a lobotomized weasel.
[03:09:10.595 --> 03:09:16.077]  Compared to Lex Luthor.
[03:09:16.077 --> 03:09:17.438]  And that's what I'm pointing out here.
[03:09:17.438 --> 03:09:21.559]  The Anglo-American power elite has about 70% of the power.
[03:09:21.559 --> 03:09:24.921]  And a lot of top political scientists agree with me on that number.
[03:09:24.921 --> 03:09:27.182]  And they're the ones breathing down my neck.
[03:09:27.182 --> 03:09:27.882]  And they're the ones
[03:09:29.335 --> 03:09:30.216]  Jacking with everybody.
[03:09:30.216 --> 03:09:31.436]  I mean, here is the New York Times.
[03:09:31.436 --> 03:09:34.158]  Scientists ponder the prospect of contagious cancer.
[03:09:34.158 --> 03:09:36.240]  Oh, it turns out the viruses are giving it to you.
[03:09:36.240 --> 03:09:38.461]  Yeah, and you put them in the vaccines.
[03:09:38.461 --> 03:09:43.144]  It's been public for decades.
[03:09:43.144 --> 03:09:47.287]  SV40 was just the beginning.
[03:09:47.287 --> 03:09:49.569]  And I read official government documents.
[03:09:51.098 --> 03:10:02.609]  About 98 million people, they believed, contracted cancer, many of which died from SV40 alone and the polio vaccine, and they think it's funny.
[03:10:02.609 --> 03:10:08.574]  Then you learn it's not a mistake, and they're now getting around to telling the public, oh, you can get cancer from a virus.
[03:10:08.574 --> 03:10:10.316]  Oh, oh, really?
[03:10:10.316 --> 03:10:10.857]  Really?
[03:10:10.857 --> 03:10:11.777]  Oh my gosh!
[03:10:12.810 --> 03:10:16.573]  That's like saying the Wright Brothers just discovered flight in 2016.
[03:10:16.573 --> 03:10:19.275]  It's just ridiculous.
[03:10:19.275 --> 03:10:20.596]  And it makes me want to throw up.
[03:10:20.596 --> 03:10:25.059]  Now, continuing here, I want to hand the baton to Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:10:25.059 --> 03:10:28.202]  I didn't get to this yesterday, I didn't get to it today, but I'm going to do it briefly now.
[03:10:28.202 --> 03:10:36.108]  And I think I'm going to shoot a special video on this to really detail it, because if you're a coward out there,
[03:10:38.683 --> 03:10:43.291]  Or you come from a perspective of fear, you would read a headline like this and it would have a bad effect.
[03:10:45.171 --> 03:10:49.294]  Backing Infowars may soon be considered material support of terrorism.
[03:10:49.294 --> 03:10:53.336]  DOJ looking to tweak Patriot Act and prosecuting anti-government extremists.
[03:10:53.336 --> 03:10:58.440]  And by that extension, being pro-life, or being pro-property right, or pro-Second Amendment.
[03:10:58.440 --> 03:10:59.761]  They're coming after everybody.
[03:10:59.761 --> 03:11:01.462]  But yes, it does.
[03:11:01.462 --> 03:11:05.725]  They have on this National Security Council, this SPLC CEO.
[03:11:05.725 --> 03:11:07.786]  The FBI doesn't even listen to the SPLC.
[03:11:07.786 --> 03:11:08.927]  They've been delisted.
[03:11:08.927 --> 03:11:09.927]  The ADL is discredited.
[03:11:11.508 --> 03:11:21.303]  Homeland Security just set up groups in the Justice Department above the FBI and these other agencies who, to their credit, know the Southern Poverty Law Center is full of prunes.
[03:11:21.303 --> 03:11:22.084]  To quote Dan Rather.
[03:11:26.109 --> 03:11:35.457]  And so, they want to be able to say that if you give money to a foreign group, you didn't know they were connected to terrorism, but later it turns out they were, you could be imprisoned.
[03:11:35.457 --> 03:11:39.621]  Well, that's unconstitutional, A. But B, it's foreign groups.
[03:11:39.621 --> 03:11:41.503]  And it's under war powers they're doing that.
[03:11:44.002 --> 03:11:46.422]  And we always said they're going to end up using this against domestic groups.
[03:11:46.422 --> 03:11:51.804]  And they admit they want to use it against returning veterans, veterans, Christians, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians.
[03:11:51.804 --> 03:11:53.304]  Remember, we broke those secret documents.
[03:11:53.304 --> 03:11:54.844]  That's now mainstream.
[03:11:54.844 --> 03:11:56.144]  They admit that.
[03:11:56.144 --> 03:11:58.865]  So this is only part of this creeping move.
[03:11:58.865 --> 03:12:00.885]  And it's meant to intimidate everybody.
[03:12:00.885 --> 03:12:06.307]  These law enforcement magazines and stuff that say, if you see a get out of the UN sticker, just go ahead and arrest them, bring them in.
[03:12:06.307 --> 03:12:11.568]  And Chiefs, there's a quote out of I think it was Weapons and Tactics of Law Enforcement I saw like 15 years ago.
[03:12:11.568 --> 03:12:12.268]  I bought it at 7-Eleven.
[03:12:13.248 --> 03:12:16.951]  It was like, you know, telling people how great it is to arrest people for their speech.
[03:12:16.951 --> 03:12:19.674]  Well, all that did was wake the cops up.
[03:12:19.674 --> 03:12:24.778]  So the good news is they're trying to start a civil war, but people aren't buying into it.
[03:12:24.778 --> 03:12:39.472]  The problem is they're able to get enough leftist whack jobs in these positions of power at the FBI and other places where they can selectively persecute and target patriots, and if they can get patriots to act stupid and be led in there by informants and do dumb stuff,
[03:12:41.181 --> 03:12:46.343]  Like what you saw out in Oregon, we're walking into a trap.
[03:12:46.343 --> 03:12:49.905]  We're winning ground informationally.
[03:12:49.905 --> 03:12:53.067]  We don't need to get into a shooting war.
[03:12:53.067 --> 03:13:03.932]  Plus, the globalists have a plan for a shooting war, and they want the Liberty Movement, the basis of good Americana rule of law people who do see our country trample.
[03:13:03.932 --> 03:13:06.013]  We see the rule of law on the toilet.
[03:13:06.013 --> 03:13:10.515]  We see a globalist occupation that's trying to cement and complete the takeover of the states.
[03:13:11.806 --> 03:13:12.907]  We have the moral high ground.
[03:13:12.907 --> 03:13:19.871]  We can go in in suits and ties, get people elected, run for office, file lawsuits, change things.
[03:13:19.871 --> 03:13:30.438]  They want to get a physical fight going that will tear up the police, tear up the feds, tear up the citizenry, and it'll make the feds go to pure secret policing activity.
[03:13:30.438 --> 03:13:32.760]  Death squads, you name it.
[03:13:32.760 --> 03:13:34.801]  Then that will escalate to civil war.
[03:13:34.801 --> 03:13:37.262]  But after a couple years of that, folks, it'll just settle down.
[03:13:37.262 --> 03:13:40.825]  They'll have a quote, armatice deal.
[03:13:41.940 --> 03:13:54.892]  With the, quote, rebel leaders who will be globalists, if they can work it that way, or groups they control, and then they'll still continue the covert war against the American people, but they'll claim that it's been de-escalated.
[03:13:54.892 --> 03:14:04.361]  Now these are standard procedures run in third world countries by both the communists and the fascists and the CIA when it adopted fascist models in the last 50 years.
[03:14:05.410 --> 03:14:07.991]  Believe me, we don't want to go down this road.
[03:14:07.991 --> 03:14:11.572]  They want to put us into a thug culture, a destabilized culture.
[03:14:11.572 --> 03:14:27.178]  The good news is the military and police, I talk to them all the time on-air and off-air, from top generals retired to, you know, top people in the military currently, and by top I mean in the officer class, I'd say mid-level, but even higher.
[03:14:29.079 --> 03:14:35.764]  And I've talked to other prominent people that talk to similar people and the same people and others, and they totally get it.
[03:14:35.764 --> 03:14:47.553]  That the foreign banks want to end America, take everybody's pensions, make us a third world country, arrest the former leadership of the military and the police, and really bring in a Soviet model.
[03:14:47.553 --> 03:14:58.301]  It won't be Soviet, but it'll be a Soviet model of implementation, just like Homeland Security hired the former head of the Stasi to set up their spy grids.
[03:15:00.796 --> 03:15:02.537]  They are setting up a nightmare scenario.
[03:15:02.537 --> 03:15:07.878]  I mean, Hillary's on TV saying, don't say father and mother and, you know, we need fun camps for men.
[03:15:07.878 --> 03:15:12.339]  We've reached that Rubicon.
[03:15:12.339 --> 03:15:18.921]  And I genuinely know that if we fall for a physical civil war, we're idiots.
[03:15:18.921 --> 03:15:25.023]  I mean, they want to brand this whole thing through Black Lives Matter because they can go with a left-wing civil war or a right-wing civil war.
[03:15:25.023 --> 03:15:28.384]  And they're looking at both or separately.
[03:15:31.067 --> 03:15:35.429]  And there couldn't be a more important subject than I'm covering right now.
[03:15:35.429 --> 03:15:40.672]  They could push for either one of those scenarios, or both at the same time, and who do they aim it at?
[03:15:40.672 --> 03:15:55.641]  The local cops, people in uniform, white people, a Marine Corps veteran is in a McDonald's and has a tattoo, so he's white, he's a Marine, people have been programmed to be racially based, they attack.
[03:15:57.759 --> 03:16:06.206]  That's not going to hurt George Soros and the globalists if citizens get killed and veterans get killed and cops get shot.
[03:16:06.206 --> 03:16:13.673]  We need to have empathy for the people in the government because not all of them took houses from old ladies.
[03:16:13.673 --> 03:16:15.434]  Not all of them are involved in criminal activity.
[03:16:15.434 --> 03:16:16.435]  In fact, a lot of them aren't.
[03:16:16.435 --> 03:16:17.556]  They're in a criminal system.
[03:16:17.556 --> 03:16:18.737]  The whole thing's criminal.
[03:16:18.737 --> 03:16:23.802]  There isn't hardly a job out there you can get that's completely moral because the system's breaking down.
[03:16:27.705 --> 03:16:32.366]  But the government and the military and the police need to know, we really have been partially taken over.
[03:16:32.366 --> 03:16:34.006]  Now the globalists are completing that.
[03:16:34.006 --> 03:16:37.347]  And have empathy for the American people, man.
[03:16:37.347 --> 03:16:38.827]  There's all the sympathy for these illegals.
[03:16:38.827 --> 03:16:39.687]  They deserve to come here.
[03:16:39.687 --> 03:16:40.987]  They deserve all this free stuff.
[03:16:40.987 --> 03:16:46.948]  But an old lady losing her house to the IRS, over $10,000 in taxes she can't pay because of medical bills, is evil!
[03:16:46.948 --> 03:16:54.130]  And you don't hear Republicans or Democrats trying to stop that.
[03:16:54.130 --> 03:16:55.110]  So that's what it comes down to.
[03:16:56.573 --> 03:17:03.895]  Is we really need to not be stupid and let them trick us into, uh, and folks, I used to see what happened at Waco when I was a younger man.
[03:17:03.895 --> 03:17:08.376]  I was smart, but not as smart as I am now or wise.
[03:17:08.376 --> 03:17:11.296]  And I would get mad and angry and, you know, think, well, they want to start a shooting war.
[03:17:11.296 --> 03:17:11.636]  That's that.
[03:17:11.636 --> 03:17:15.637]  I'm not going to start it myself, but we'll show them that is just so dumb.
[03:17:15.637 --> 03:17:19.418]  Now that doesn't mean if they false flags and come after people and take our liberties.
[03:17:21.240 --> 03:17:24.183]  That doesn't mean we have a right to defend ourselves.
[03:17:24.183 --> 03:17:27.387]  But if we've gotten to that point, it means that we've lost the first phase.
[03:17:27.387 --> 03:17:29.209]  Paul Watson, I know you've got a lot to cover today.
[03:17:29.209 --> 03:17:31.231]  Any take on the last hour and a half?
[03:17:31.231 --> 03:17:33.013]  Other big news breaking?
[03:17:33.013 --> 03:17:34.334]  The fall of the House of Bush?
[03:17:34.334 --> 03:17:35.896]  Hillary stealing more elections?
[03:17:35.896 --> 03:17:36.977]  What's on your radar today?
[03:17:36.977 --> 03:17:38.759]  Coming up, Paul Joseph Watson from London, England.
[03:17:40.319 --> 03:17:50.463]  Well, we're going to look at the free speech issue again, Alex, from the perspective of social media, because what's happening on Facebook and Twitter is being mirrored in the real world.
[03:17:50.463 --> 03:17:53.163]  You know, people are being arrested for their tweets.
[03:17:53.163 --> 03:17:56.645]  They're being harassed, interrogated for, quote, hate speech.
[03:17:56.645 --> 03:17:57.065]  Every day!
[03:17:57.825 --> 03:17:58.886]  Yeah.
[03:17:58.886 --> 03:18:00.226]  But that's being broadened.
[03:18:00.226 --> 03:18:08.190]  The definition of hate speech and harassment is being broadened by social media, and then it's being replicated in the real world.
[03:18:08.190 --> 03:18:14.913]  So, people... Zuckerberg says hurting someone's feelings or disagreeing is hate, and then it's adopted.
[03:18:14.913 --> 03:18:16.554]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:18:16.554 --> 03:18:25.118]  Yeah, that's not the issue, because, you know, for example, in Holland, there was a guy who said that their country's refugee policy was, quote, a bad plan.
[03:18:25.118 --> 03:18:26.979]  He got a home visit by police.
[03:18:27.932 --> 03:18:31.034]  So it doesn't matter what you think constitutes hate speech or harassment.
[03:18:31.034 --> 03:18:36.938]  If we allow them to redefine it, then it's going to come back on us through official state oppression.
[03:18:36.938 --> 03:18:42.041]  This is government intimidation and setting the precedent to start disappearing people.
[03:18:42.041 --> 03:18:49.566]  We have to exercise our free speech in Europe and the US so aggressively that they're forced to back off or they'll get to the next level.
[03:18:49.566 --> 03:18:54.350]  And we've now reached the next level and we're desperately trying to stop a civil war.
[03:18:54.350 --> 03:18:55.791]  Same thing in Europe, Paul.
[03:18:55.791 --> 03:18:56.431]  What do you think?
[03:18:56.431 --> 03:18:57.572]  And I'm going to skip this network break.
[03:18:59.053 --> 03:19:05.336]  What do you think is happening, Paul, with the situation in Germany with the migrant center burned and folks are cheering it?
[03:19:05.336 --> 03:19:07.638]  I mean, are they pushing the Germans into open revolt?
[03:19:09.275 --> 03:19:22.719]  Well, I've said all along, Alex, that if you leave a vacuum and you don't address legitimate concerns from the German people, you're going to create that vacuum which will be filled by extremists on both sides.
[03:19:22.719 --> 03:19:33.302]  It's going to be filled with Islamists on the one hand, who advocate, you know, these migrants traveling to Europe and basically trying to conquer the entire continent, which we've seen top imams call for.
[03:19:33.962 --> 03:19:41.844]  And then on the other side you're going to get Neo-Nazis who physically attack migrants, in many cases innocent people, and burn down migrant centres.
[03:19:41.844 --> 03:19:53.007]  So if you create that vacuum and the only people that German citizens have to turn to to represent their legitimate concerns are these extremists, then you're going to empower extremists.
[03:19:53.007 --> 03:19:55.788]  I've been saying that for months and months and months.
[03:19:55.788 --> 03:20:00.709]  We saw it in Sweden with a Polish group that tried to attack a migrant centre in Sweden.
[03:20:01.169 --> 03:20:11.075]  Now we're seeing it here in Germany as well, so that is only going to increase, which is why all these top security experts are warning about civil unrest in all these major European cities.
[03:20:11.075 --> 03:20:16.759]  That has been created by the policies of people like Merkel, and now they're going to reap the whirlwind.
[03:20:18.086 --> 03:20:25.772]  What about Hollande saying if any country elects a right-winger that he disagrees with, they're going to put sanctions on the country and not let you travel to the EU.
[03:20:25.772 --> 03:20:28.194]  This is so dictatorial.
[03:20:28.194 --> 03:20:30.716]  France is still under a civil emergency.
[03:20:30.716 --> 03:20:37.422]  They're giving awards to the socialist government who brought the Islamic Jihad scumbags into the country.
[03:20:39.107 --> 03:20:54.376]  Well, of course, the irony of those comments that Alon made is that he said that those measures would be necessary to ban right-wing parties, even if they're democratically elected, in the name of protecting democracy.
[03:20:54.376 --> 03:21:00.560]  So they annul the vote of the people, the democratic vote, in the name of protecting democracy.
[03:21:00.560 --> 03:21:01.720]  We have now reached pure 1984.
[03:21:03.868 --> 03:21:19.012]  Yeah, and it's because their propaganda campaigns against the likes of Marine Le Pen and, in Britain, Nigel Farage are completely failing because, again, these are the populists, like Donald Trump, that are representing embracing people's genuine concerns.
[03:21:19.012 --> 03:21:22.492]  When there's no one left to embrace that, then that's what's going to happen.
[03:21:22.492 --> 03:21:30.594]  So, again, you're banning right-wing parties that are democratically elected in the name of protecting democracy.
[03:21:30.594 --> 03:21:33.075]  You couldn't get any more Orwellian than that.
[03:21:33.903 --> 03:21:40.005]  It is over-the-top bizarre, and then the very people that bring in the jihadis get awards for hurting the public.
[03:21:40.005 --> 03:21:41.606]  Simply amazing.
[03:21:41.606 --> 03:21:44.027]  Paul, I'm gonna punch you out here and let you take over.
[03:21:44.027 --> 03:21:44.647]  Great job.
[03:21:44.647 --> 03:21:49.929]  I know you have a lot of stuff to cover, a lot of information, but briefly, since you're in the UK,
[03:21:51.798 --> 03:21:52.358]  I don't know.
[03:22:14.144 --> 03:22:19.028]  Well it is, and that's why the Prime Minister Cameron basically pulled off this bluff.
[03:22:19.028 --> 03:22:25.694]  He went to the EU to negotiate a better deal to try and bolster the campaign to stay in the EU.
[03:22:25.694 --> 03:22:31.579]  But if you actually analyse this so-called deal he made with the EU, nothing whatsoever changes.
[03:22:31.579 --> 03:22:36.243]  So he didn't obtain any new special provisions that would bolster British sovereignty.
[03:22:36.243 --> 03:22:37.805]  He achieved absolutely nothing.
[03:22:38.385 --> 03:22:43.228]  So now in the aftermath of that, of course, Cameron is committed to staying in the EU.
[03:22:43.228 --> 03:22:59.098]  But what's interesting is that not only Michael Gove, who's quite well-respected Conservative Party member, but Boris Johnson, who is one of the very few politicians in Britain that has a higher popularity than negativity rating, he's come out
[03:22:59.798 --> 03:23:00.558]  To leave.
[03:23:00.558 --> 03:23:02.599]  He wants Britain to leave the EU.
[03:23:02.599 --> 03:23:07.020]  So now they're saying that that's going to sway, you know, a third of people who are undecided.
[03:23:07.020 --> 03:23:11.721]  They're going to support to leave simply because of Boris Johnson's endorsement to leave.
[03:23:11.721 --> 03:23:13.642]  So that is a huge story.
[03:23:13.642 --> 03:23:18.383]  So again, going forward, it comes down to who's going to advocate leaving and staying.
[03:23:18.383 --> 03:23:20.704]  Some polls have shown that it's 50-50.
[03:23:20.704 --> 03:23:24.605]  Others have shown that the vote to stay is significantly ahead.
[03:23:25.485 --> 03:23:27.946]  The vote's going to be in about four months time.
[03:23:27.946 --> 03:23:29.907]  It's going to be June 23rd.
[03:23:29.907 --> 03:23:43.172]  And as you said, it's going to be huge because it could create that domino effect where the EU completely loses any possibility of becoming the federal super state that it was always designed to be.
[03:23:43.172 --> 03:23:44.513]  That's right.
[03:23:44.513 --> 03:23:47.134]  Paul, I want to finally hear
[03:23:48.547 --> 03:23:50.028]  Get your take on the U.S.
[03:23:50.028 --> 03:23:54.130]  election briefly, and then I'm going to hand the baton over.
[03:23:54.130 --> 03:23:56.611]  In fact, I'm going to do that after I leave.
[03:23:56.611 --> 03:23:59.012]  I want you to give your take until you go to break on the U.S.
[03:23:59.012 --> 03:24:04.955]  election, on Trump, on what your gut thinks is going to end up unfolding here, because I legitimately want to hear that myself.
[03:24:04.955 --> 03:24:05.716]  I respect your view.
[03:24:06.596 --> 03:24:08.157]  But what about this?
[03:24:08.157 --> 03:24:11.620]  This image of Mark Zuckerberg says so much about our future.
[03:24:11.620 --> 03:24:16.624]  I agree with The Verge, and I agree with Drudge linking to that, that it does say it all.
[03:24:16.624 --> 03:24:20.428]  Drudge said the rise of the Facebook zombies.
[03:24:20.428 --> 03:24:26.793]  Talk about Plato's allegory of the cave, where they have these things projected on the cave wall by their controllers.
[03:24:26.793 --> 03:24:27.654]  He's walking by,
[03:24:28.979 --> 03:24:31.440]  Jobs didn't let his kids use iPads or any of this stuff.
[03:24:31.440 --> 03:24:33.000]  He said it was dumbing them down.
[03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:34.381]  Here's Zuckerberg walking by.
[03:24:34.381 --> 03:24:35.901]  He's a human bipedal.
[03:24:35.901 --> 03:24:38.382]  They're all sitting there like squat prisoners.
[03:24:38.382 --> 03:24:43.023]  They've all got basically digital hoods over their heads with his reality being pumped to them.
[03:24:43.023 --> 03:24:44.563]  They sleep, he lives.
[03:24:44.563 --> 03:24:47.144]  This is the beginning of the Matrix taking over.
[03:24:47.144 --> 03:24:48.585]  This really says it all.
[03:24:48.585 --> 03:24:51.485]  What do you have to say to that particular photo?
[03:24:51.485 --> 03:24:53.286]  Paul Joseph Watson from London.
[03:24:54.997 --> 03:24:57.479]  Well, it's, you know, it's the singularity, isn't it?
[03:24:57.479 --> 03:25:00.341]  It's Ray Kurzweil's man merging with machine.
[03:25:00.341 --> 03:25:04.965]  Ultimately, the elite want to actually merge with computers to escape death.
[03:25:04.965 --> 03:25:07.867]  They want to download their brains into computers.
[03:25:07.867 --> 03:25:11.070]  What's positive, though, is that there's kind of a backlash.
[03:25:11.070 --> 03:25:14.233]  There's an article on Drudge, which is out of the Financial Times.
[03:25:14.233 --> 03:25:16.274]  People are going back to simple phones.
[03:25:16.274 --> 03:25:19.557]  People are getting back... There's been a movement for years for old tech.
[03:25:19.557 --> 03:25:21.078]  People are now prizing it.
[03:25:21.078 --> 03:25:21.779]  Exactly, Paul.
[03:25:22.878 --> 03:25:25.821]  Because, I mean, all the studies show that it makes you miserable.
[03:25:25.821 --> 03:25:30.367]  If you're constantly glued to your phone all day, you start to feel overwhelmed.
[03:25:30.367 --> 03:25:32.709]  You don't have any headspace whatsoever.
[03:25:32.709 --> 03:25:37.815]  I mean, I've done experiments myself, just staying off social media for half a day.
[03:25:37.815 --> 03:25:39.977]  Your mind is a hundred percent clearer.
[03:25:40.518 --> 03:25:54.263]  And as you said, this article, you know, a lot of professional people, they're using smartphones in the day, but as soon as the night time comes, as soon as they're going out in the evening, they're reversing back to these, quote, dumb phones, so they're only going to take emergency calls.
[03:25:54.263 --> 03:25:56.723]  So they're not constantly checking social media.
[03:25:56.723 --> 03:25:57.144]  Exactly.
[03:25:57.144 --> 03:26:00.485]  That's what I've had to force myself to do, and it's part of my job to always know what's going on.
[03:26:00.485 --> 03:26:06.767]  So I actually have a home phone with crew that's on staff, and then they call me if there's something big enough.
[03:26:07.267 --> 03:26:15.474]  But I get home at 6-7, I turn the thing off, I try to turn it off during the weekend, or... But see, I'm not checking Facebook status and trying to be trendy.
[03:26:15.474 --> 03:26:16.935]  This is our job.
[03:26:16.935 --> 03:26:24.882]  And we use it as a tool, but still, I gotta go outside, I gotta go for a hike with my kids, I gotta go swimming, I gotta go barbecue, I've gotta get away from these little devils.
[03:26:26.431 --> 03:26:30.434]  You have to switch off, because they're physically rewiring your brains.
[03:26:30.434 --> 03:26:31.815]  That's been proven.
[03:26:31.815 --> 03:26:34.417]  And they've been proven to make people depressed.
[03:26:34.417 --> 03:26:47.346]  Anyone who spends too much time on social media becomes depressed, because they're seeing their friends, they're seeing all these photos of their friends having fun at parties and nightclubs, and they think that that's the day-to-day life of everyone.
[03:26:47.346 --> 03:26:52.650]  Yeah, people only go out to have fake experiences to show off to people online.
[03:26:53.493 --> 03:26:55.234]  Yeah, it's virtue signaling.
[03:26:55.234 --> 03:26:59.717]  Meanwhile, people who are in my house... People who are in my house... And that accelerates the social clash in me.
[03:27:11.324 --> 03:27:17.789]  And you have to go on it, but to a great extent, as he said, when you go out, just leave it behind, even if it's just for an hour or two.
[03:27:17.789 --> 03:27:21.692]  Well, when people come to my house, as you know, Paul, I say, turn the phones off.
[03:27:21.692 --> 03:27:23.253]  No Facebook, no Twitter.
[03:27:23.253 --> 03:27:26.176]  Do not send pictures of us standing around the Christmas tree together.
[03:27:26.176 --> 03:27:28.858]  And people have done it, and I blow up at them.
[03:27:28.858 --> 03:27:29.739]  People I've known for a while.
[03:27:29.739 --> 03:27:32.841]  I literally tell them, if you ever do that again, you're out of my life.
[03:27:32.841 --> 03:27:34.342]  Do you understand?
[03:27:34.342 --> 03:27:34.963]  Do you understand?
[03:27:34.963 --> 03:27:36.224]  And I'm not trying to be mean about this.
[03:27:36.224 --> 03:27:38.706]  It's just, I want to just absolutely
[03:27:39.628 --> 03:27:40.309]  Go to the moon!
[03:27:40.309 --> 03:27:44.512]  I get so angry when people just try to document their lives and everything they're doing.
[03:27:44.512 --> 03:27:48.434]  We only do this to document tyranny and to document people fighting back against it.
[03:27:48.434 --> 03:27:49.795]  But I'm going to get off my high horse.
[03:27:49.795 --> 03:27:50.816]  Paul, great job.
[03:27:50.816 --> 03:27:53.038]  I want to thank all the listeners and viewers for their support.
[03:27:53.038 --> 03:27:53.718]  Spreading the word.
[03:27:53.718 --> 03:27:56.080]  We've got great deals running right now.
[03:27:56.080 --> 03:27:58.001]  The liver cleanse is back in.
[03:27:58.001 --> 03:27:58.802]  Liver Shield.

[03:28:19.378 --> 03:28:23.782]  We have the Hillary for Prison shirts, a new design, limited edition back in as well.
[03:28:23.782 --> 03:28:26.484]  And it's your funding of our operation that makes it all possible.
[03:28:26.484 --> 03:28:27.705]  So we salute you.
[03:28:27.705 --> 03:28:28.766]  Look how far we've come.
[03:28:28.766 --> 03:28:29.687]  Paul, I want to ask you this.
[03:28:30.347 --> 03:28:32.511]  How big is it, Trump, coming out for 9-11 Truth?
[03:28:32.511 --> 03:28:33.954]  Did it make Jeb drop out?
[03:28:33.954 --> 03:28:38.141]  Your take on the election for a few minutes when we come back, and then get into all your other subjects.
[03:28:38.141 --> 03:28:39.143]  Paul Watson, take over.
[03:28:39.143 --> 03:28:40.806]  Thank you, my friend.
[03:28:40.806 --> 03:28:41.467]  Okay, thanks, Alex.
[03:28:42.403 --> 03:28:46.004]  No, I mean, the Trump-Saudi Arabia thing was absolutely huge.
[03:28:46.004 --> 03:28:51.505]  It really seems to have polarised the Conservatives, the neocon element against him.
[03:28:51.505 --> 03:28:55.686]  But, you know, as he's proved in South Carolina, it's having no effect whatsoever.
[03:28:55.686 --> 03:28:57.106]  The attacks are having no effect.
[03:28:57.106 --> 03:29:05.867]  He continues to surge forward because he's a true populist and he embraces and represents people's genuine frustrations.
[03:29:05.867 --> 03:29:08.328]  There's been a lot of propaganda about Trump recently that
[03:29:08.928 --> 03:29:13.070]  You know, he's only supported by dumb people who have a third grade reading level.
[03:29:13.070 --> 03:29:16.172]  Those are his, you know, the tone of his speeches, etc.
[03:29:16.172 --> 03:29:23.655]  Now, from what I've read today, he's starting to have a broader appeal to, you know, high paid professionals.
[03:29:23.655 --> 03:29:27.157]  This is not, he's not supported by an army of dumb people.
[03:29:27.157 --> 03:29:30.098]  More and more intelligent people are getting behind his message.
[03:29:30.098 --> 03:29:32.600]  The GOP establishment, now that Bush is out,
[03:29:33.600 --> 03:29:40.702]  We'll have to face up to the fact that they will have to embrace him and support him and abandon this idea of a broken convention.
[03:29:40.702 --> 03:29:46.164]  So it's going to be very exciting going forward and we're going to get more into it after the break on the Alex Jones Show Live.
[03:29:46.164 --> 03:29:48.005]  Stay with us for the fourth hour overdrive.
[03:29:48.005 --> 03:29:51.806]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.806 --> 03:29:54.447]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:58.547 --> 03:30:04.873]  Putin has reportedly threatened to launch tactical nukes at Turkey if the ISIS-supporting country invades Syria with Saudi Arabia.
[03:30:04.873 --> 03:30:09.296]  The Russians have about 20,000 troops in Syria helping the Syrian government fight ISIS.
[03:30:09.296 --> 03:30:15.602]  And Putin warned the Turkish president that Moscow is prepared to use tactical nuclear weapons to protect its troops if Turkey attacks.
[03:30:16.082 --> 03:30:26.310]  Since Turkey is part of NATO, any such conflict could quickly escalate into a full-scale nuclear confrontation, said award-winning Iran-Contra journalist Robert Perry, who was tipped off about the warning.
[03:30:26.310 --> 03:30:34.896]  Moscow's apparent threat to repel a Turkish invasion of Syria with nukes follows a warning by the Russian Prime Minister that another world war will erupt if the U.S.
[03:30:34.896 --> 03:30:37.318]  and its allies send ground troops into Syria.
[03:30:37.318 --> 03:30:43.643]  And if Syria falls, Russia will be geopolitically isolated from the rest of the world, which is exactly what the globalists want.
[03:30:43.943 --> 03:30:46.688]  So they can easily hijack and control the country.
[03:30:46.688 --> 03:30:55.663]  And further adding to the threat of world war, Saudi Arabia is currently staging the biggest war game the region has seen in 25 years, according to Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:30:55.663 --> 03:30:56.965]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[03:30:58.482 --> 03:30:59.062]  I want more candy!
[03:30:59.062 --> 03:31:00.203]  I want more video games!
[03:31:00.203 --> 03:31:00.403]  Mine!
[03:31:00.403 --> 03:31:00.864]  Mine!
[03:31:00.864 --> 03:31:01.724]  Mine!
[03:31:01.724 --> 03:31:11.451]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[03:31:11.451 --> 03:31:14.153]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[03:31:14.153 --> 03:31:17.716]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[03:31:17.716 --> 03:31:20.458]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system.
[03:31:20.598 --> 03:31:24.019]  And are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[03:31:24.019 --> 03:31:26.739]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down.
[03:31:26.739 --> 03:31:29.160]  And then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.

[03:32:02.848 --> 03:32:07.614]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[03:32:07.614 --> 03:32:08.955]  Talk about the effects.
[03:32:08.955 --> 03:32:10.457]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[03:32:10.457 --> 03:32:12.379]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[03:32:12.379 --> 03:32:13.500]  I feel like I look better.
[03:32:13.500 --> 03:32:14.221]  I feel better.
[03:32:14.221 --> 03:32:15.623]  I feel sexier.
[03:32:15.623 --> 03:32:16.243]  I love it.

[03:33:14.845 --> 03:33:19.931]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:19.931 --> 03:33:24.536]  You're back on the Alex Jones Show live, fourth hour overdrive.
[03:33:24.536 --> 03:33:26.959]  Now, as we got into before the break there with Alex...
[03:33:27.680 --> 03:33:31.625]  We really need to focus again on this Twitter free speech issue.
[03:33:31.625 --> 03:33:33.287]  Because this is why it matters.
[03:33:33.287 --> 03:33:36.451]  It doesn't matter if you don't use Twitter.
[03:33:36.451 --> 03:33:40.576]  Doesn't matter if you don't use Facebook or any form of social media.
[03:33:40.576 --> 03:33:44.661]  What we see in the online world is being replicated in the real world.
[03:33:45.319 --> 03:33:52.624]  In the United Kingdom, something like 30,000 people a year are arrested for their tweets.
[03:33:52.624 --> 03:33:57.667]  And yes, a significant portion of those tweets are going to be violent, hateful.
[03:33:57.667 --> 03:34:01.610]  They're going to break laws and people are rightly going to be arrested for it.
[03:34:02.450 --> 03:34:15.098]  But then we have cases like the one in Canada with Gregory Allen Elliott, who went through a multi-year court case at great expense, basically ruined his life and his career.
[03:34:15.098 --> 03:34:15.999]  For what?
[03:34:15.999 --> 03:34:19.901]  He got on Twitter and disagreed with some feminists.
[03:34:19.901 --> 03:34:30.228]  Because now, according to feminists, disagreeing with them or saying, you suck, is a form of harassment, is a form of cyber violence.
[03:34:30.948 --> 03:34:39.391]  So when you're getting home visits for disagreeing with people on social media, that's why it's a problem in the real world.
[03:34:39.391 --> 03:34:45.173]  That's why saying, oh, let's just build a platform different to Twitter, isn't a solution.
[03:34:45.173 --> 03:34:50.415]  That's why saying, oh, Twitter's a private company, it can censors who it likes, isn't the issue.
[03:34:51.161 --> 03:34:59.626]  Yes, that's true, but increasingly social media, Twitter especially, is becoming a kind of public commons.
[03:34:59.626 --> 03:35:05.449]  Even people inside Twitter consider it to be a form of public communications utility.
[03:35:05.449 --> 03:35:16.755]  So the fact that they've now introduced, as we documented a few weeks ago, this Trust and Safety Council that said, freedom of expression begins with safety.
[03:35:17.535 --> 03:35:22.659]  This new Orwellian Council to police free speech on Twitter.
[03:35:22.659 --> 03:35:24.661]  This is why it's of concern.
[03:35:24.661 --> 03:35:34.469]  Because as we documented, not one single group on Twitter's Trust and Safety Council is a robust defender of free speech.
[03:35:34.469 --> 03:35:37.671]  Not one group is conservative.
[03:35:37.671 --> 03:35:46.839]  And in fact, Feminist Frequency, led by Anita Sarkeesian, is the group that considers disagreeing with feminists to be harassment.
[03:35:47.881 --> 03:35:53.951]  So as we predicted, conservative voices are now being silenced on Twitter.
[03:35:53.951 --> 03:36:01.222]  So even if you push aside the whole public commons issue, and that people are getting home visits from police in the Netherlands,
[03:36:02.065 --> 03:36:06.030]  For saying that their country's refugee policy is a quote, bad plan.
[03:36:06.030 --> 03:36:14.320]  Even if you push aside all that, it's rampant hypocrisy on the part of Twitter and it's why their stock price is plummeting.
[03:36:14.320 --> 03:36:20.528]  It's why prominent people on Twitter with millions and millions of followers like Stephen Fry last week
[03:36:21.329 --> 03:36:29.193]  are quitting because these professionally outraged social justice mobs are running rampant.
[03:36:29.193 --> 03:36:37.337]  And Twitter is bending to their authority and in fact hiring them, working alongside them to censor free speech.
[03:36:37.337 --> 03:36:49.704]  And again, if we allow the definition of harassment to be broadened to disagreeing with a feminist is cyber violence and harassment, then we're going to have real problems for free speech in the real world.
[03:36:50.683 --> 03:36:55.425]  And now on Friday night, they censored another Conservative voice.
[03:36:55.425 --> 03:36:57.867]  This is out of Reason.com.
[03:36:57.867 --> 03:37:02.209]  Did Twitter's Orwellian Trust and Safety Council get Robert Stacey McCain banned?
[03:37:03.331 --> 03:37:17.362]  Remember a few days ago when Twitter elevated anti-Gamergate leader Anita Sarkeesian to its Trust and Safety Council, an imperious-sounding committee with Robosphere-esque powers, to police discussion on the social media platform.
[03:37:17.362 --> 03:37:23.727]  The goal, according to Twitter, was to make it easier for users to express themselves freely and safely.
[03:37:24.605 --> 03:37:37.438]  Well, one user who won't be expressing himself at all is Robert Stacey McCain, a conservative journalist, blogger, self-described anti-feminist and prominent Gamergate figure who was banned from Twitter on Friday night.
[03:37:37.438 --> 03:37:47.187]  Clicking on his page redirects to, quote, this account is suspended message that encourages users to reread Twitter's policies on abusive behavior.
[03:37:47.187 --> 03:37:48.489]  So again, what was his crime?
[03:37:49.520 --> 03:37:52.701]  Well, he basically disagreed with Anita Sarkeesian.
[03:37:52.701 --> 03:37:57.642]  Twitter doesn't even provide you with the reason for your account being suspended.
[03:37:57.642 --> 03:38:00.843]  And with journalists, this is a huge deal.
[03:38:00.843 --> 03:38:04.384]  People spend years and years building up their Twitter accounts.
[03:38:04.384 --> 03:38:07.485]  They put hundreds and hundreds of hours of work into it.
[03:38:08.217 --> 03:38:10.919]  And in an instant, it's gone.
[03:38:10.919 --> 03:38:18.125]  Because this individual dared to disagree with a feminist because he had the wrong politics.
[03:38:18.125 --> 03:38:20.326]  His account has been suspended.
[03:38:20.326 --> 03:38:23.789]  He started a second account which was also quickly suspended.
[03:38:23.789 --> 03:38:27.191]  So don't expect it to come back anytime soon.
[03:38:27.191 --> 03:38:29.833]  And this is the hypocrisy that I'm talking about.
[03:38:29.833 --> 03:38:36.839]  While this conservative is being suspended for little more than disagreeing with feminists, for having the wrong politics,
[03:38:38.066 --> 03:38:48.071]  There's a Kill Donald Trump account that was on Twitter active for six months without being suspended.
[03:38:48.071 --> 03:38:53.053]  Now I published this article on Infowars.com earlier this afternoon.
[03:38:53.053 --> 03:38:55.975]  Twitter bans conservative blogger.
[03:38:55.975 --> 03:38:59.397]  Kill Trump account still active six months later.
[03:39:00.225 --> 03:39:14.882]  As Twitter suspended the account of yet another Conservative for the crime of having the wrong politics, an account called Kill Donald Trump that advocates assassinating the Republican frontrunner is still active six months later.
[03:39:14.882 --> 03:39:16.304]  This is the hypocrisy!
[03:39:17.284 --> 03:39:27.530]  Now of course, literally minutes, it was probably about 10 minutes after this article was published, Twitter suspended this account.
[03:39:27.530 --> 03:39:33.353]  But it took them six months to do so, and it took a major publication to point it out.
[03:39:34.173 --> 03:39:49.914]  Despite the fact that this account had been retweeting open, direct death threats from leftists who wanted to assassinate Donald Trump, and in fact direct tweets from this account itself,
[03:39:51.027 --> 03:39:56.993]  Again, advocating the assassination of the potential next President of the United States.
[03:39:56.993 --> 03:40:00.056]  That remains online for six months.
[03:40:00.056 --> 03:40:07.043]  A conservative blogger who criticizes feminism, his account is gone in an instant and it ain't coming back.
[03:40:07.043 --> 03:40:08.625]  This is the hypocrisy with Twitter.
[03:40:09.185 --> 03:40:23.229]  It's been taken over by social justice warriors who hate free speech, whose entire raison d'etre and motive is to censor free speech and turn the internet into one giant safe space.
[03:40:23.229 --> 03:40:26.149]  Listen to these tweets that were being sent out by this account.
[03:40:26.149 --> 03:40:28.190]  For six months this was active.
[03:40:29.329 --> 03:40:30.149]  This is a quote.
[03:40:30.149 --> 03:40:31.810]  This is one of the tweets.
[03:40:31.810 --> 03:40:36.252]  That bleeping bleep Donald Trump should effing die.
[03:40:36.252 --> 03:40:38.052]  Anyone got any people?
[03:40:38.052 --> 03:40:42.174]  Go to his election and shoot him with a sniper.
[03:40:42.174 --> 03:40:45.735]  Okay, that was on Twitter for six months.
[03:40:45.735 --> 03:40:46.956]  Here's another one.
[03:40:46.956 --> 03:40:47.976]  Quote.
[03:40:47.976 --> 03:40:50.237]  Anyone know a person that can kill Donald Trump?
[03:40:51.613 --> 03:40:54.874]  Direct violation of Twitter's terms of service.
[03:40:54.874 --> 03:40:56.434]  Of course, it's a death threat.
[03:40:56.434 --> 03:40:57.715]  It's a crime.
[03:40:57.715 --> 03:41:08.018]  It remained on Twitter for six months because their Trust and Safety Council has nothing to do with stemming actual abuse and threats.
[03:41:08.018 --> 03:41:10.158]  It's to do with policing discussion.
[03:41:10.158 --> 03:41:13.679]  It's to do with silencing conservative voices.
[03:41:13.679 --> 03:41:15.400]  Now, as soon as I publish this article,
[03:41:16.440 --> 03:41:23.502]  I began to receive other tweets from other leftists who had openly advocated assassinating Donald Trump.
[03:41:23.502 --> 03:41:28.143]  And this is an issue we covered multiple times over the past six months.
[03:41:28.143 --> 03:41:37.245]  After every single debate, there's an explosion of tweets on Twitter from leftists advocating the assassination of Donald Trump.
[03:41:37.245 --> 03:41:40.226]  In the majority of cases, nothing happens to these accounts.
[03:41:40.226 --> 03:41:41.226]  They're not suspended.
[03:41:42.096 --> 03:41:42.736]  Here's another one.
[03:41:42.736 --> 03:41:45.318]  This has been online for 48 hours.
[03:41:45.318 --> 03:41:47.279]  Again, the user has not been suspended.
[03:41:59.209 --> 03:42:04.834]  There's another account which I retweeted on my timeline which basically says the same thing.
[03:42:04.834 --> 03:42:16.085]  So we have a constant deluge of people openly advocating and in some cases actually saying they will directly plan the assassination of Donald Trump.
[03:42:16.085 --> 03:42:18.347]  Twitter does absolutely nothing.
[03:42:19.178 --> 03:42:25.102]  But they will censor a conservative journalist for criticizing feminism.
[03:42:25.102 --> 03:42:30.746]  They will de-verify a prominent conservative journalist, Milo Yiannopoulos.
[03:42:30.746 --> 03:42:32.347]  Again, for what reason?
[03:42:32.347 --> 03:42:34.289]  Nobody knows.
[03:42:34.289 --> 03:42:46.017]  We've got sources inside Twitter that Yiannopoulos spoke to that said they were shadow-banning conservatives, which means that their tweets are not showing up on the timelines of people who follow them.
[03:42:46.877 --> 03:42:55.701]  So again, they're skewing Twitter to this leftist perspective because its director, its CEO, Jack Dorsey, is in with that crowd.
[03:42:55.701 --> 03:42:57.222]  He's in with Obama.
[03:42:57.222 --> 03:42:59.203]  He's in with the Black Lives Matter hate group.
[03:43:00.069 --> 03:43:12.320]  And when Twitter becomes a public commons, and these are the actions they take to censor free speech, to suspend, to ban conservative voices, then yes we should be concerned about it.
[03:43:12.320 --> 03:43:15.062]  Doesn't matter again if you don't use Twitter.
[03:43:15.062 --> 03:43:21.208]  It matters because this is having real world consequences.
[03:43:21.208 --> 03:43:25.451]  And yet here we have the Council on American Islamic Relations
[03:43:26.656 --> 03:43:33.980]  Hamas supporting care takes on Trump accuses GOP frontrunner of inciting violence against Muslims.
[03:43:33.980 --> 03:43:43.586]  So again, because Donald Trump gave a speech in which he alluded to a historical event, they're calling for him to be censored for his hate speech.
[03:43:43.586 --> 03:43:50.811]  Meanwhile, every single day on Twitter, there are people advocating for the assassination of Trump.
[03:43:51.735 --> 03:43:58.198]  There are Islamists advocating all manner of violence again, nothing whatsoever happens to them.
[03:43:58.198 --> 03:44:01.239]  So it really is a key issue going forward.
[03:44:01.239 --> 03:44:08.003]  Because people again, as I've said, Gregory Allen Elliott, and he's not the only one, they've had their lives ruined over tweets.
[03:44:08.903 --> 03:44:14.689]  This isn't just, oh my account's suspended, I can't go on Twitter again, oh well, never mind.
[03:44:14.689 --> 03:44:15.990]  They're getting arrested.
[03:44:15.990 --> 03:44:18.353]  They're getting put up in court for this.
[03:44:18.353 --> 03:44:28.262]  So if we allow the definition of harassment to be expanded to you sending a message to a feminist saying, I disagree with you, you're a liar.
[03:44:28.262 --> 03:44:29.404]  And that's hate speech.
[03:44:30.609 --> 03:44:34.570]  Then it's a dangerous and chilling precedent for free speech.
[03:44:34.570 --> 03:44:46.214]  Because of course it also intimidates people against criticizing feminism, against criticizing gun control, you name it, against criticizing Hillary Clinton.
[03:44:46.214 --> 03:44:50.636]  So you create this environment in which people self-censor.
[03:44:50.636 --> 03:44:59.119]  They're afraid to express their opinions because they might get their account suspended or even further they might get harassed by the state.
[03:45:00.400 --> 03:45:06.644]  This is why we need to stand up to this, and this is why I've emphasised it over and over again.
[03:45:06.644 --> 03:45:12.367]  Moving on though, we had a shooting over the weekend, of course, in Michigan.
[03:45:12.367 --> 03:45:14.948]  An Uber driver basically went on a rampage.
[03:45:14.948 --> 03:45:16.729]  It was completely random.
[03:45:16.729 --> 03:45:23.253]  This was an Uber driver who was targeting people randomly, targeting people who he was picking up in his vehicle.
[03:45:24.545 --> 03:45:28.171]  And yet, how did the perpetually outraged left react?
[03:45:28.171 --> 03:45:36.683]  Well, of course, they whined and complained about the fact that it wasn't being described as terrorism because the guy was white.
[03:45:36.683 --> 03:45:38.466]  So again, we need to remind them.
[03:45:39.656 --> 03:45:42.137]  This is the definition of terrorism.
[03:45:42.137 --> 03:45:49.778]  The use of violent acts to frighten the people in an area as a way of trying to achieve a political goal.
[03:45:49.778 --> 03:45:55.680]  It doesn't matter what the skin color is of the person carrying out the violence.
[03:45:55.680 --> 03:45:57.120]  That doesn't make them a terrorist.
[03:45:57.120 --> 03:46:02.421]  What makes them a terrorist is if they're carrying out that violence in pursuit of a political goal.
[03:46:02.421 --> 03:46:03.042]  Okay?
[03:46:03.042 --> 03:46:04.202]  Dylann Roof.
[03:46:04.202 --> 03:46:04.562]  White.
[03:46:05.575 --> 03:46:11.399]  Did he carry out his massacre of people in Charleston, black people in Charleston, as part of a political motive?
[03:46:11.399 --> 03:46:12.219]  Yes.
[03:46:12.219 --> 03:46:13.940]  He's a terrorist.
[03:46:13.940 --> 03:46:16.462]  Ishmael Brinsley in New York City.
[03:46:16.462 --> 03:46:21.225]  Did he kill two New York police officers in pursuit of a political goal?
[03:46:21.225 --> 03:46:23.286]  The answer is yes.
[03:46:23.286 --> 03:46:26.949]  It was part of a Black Lives Matter revenge attack.
[03:46:26.949 --> 03:46:30.511]  Violence plus political motive equals terrorism.
[03:46:30.511 --> 03:46:33.133]  Being white is not a political motive.
[03:46:34.315 --> 03:46:54.070]  And yet again we had this cacophony of Black Lives Matter supporters of leftists coming out after this tragic shooting in Michigan, asserting that it was terrorism purely because the shooter was white, when in reality there was no political motive whatsoever by the very nature of the attack.
[03:46:54.070 --> 03:46:56.492]  It was completely random.
[03:46:56.492 --> 03:46:58.034]  It was a nutcase.
[03:46:58.034 --> 03:47:02.157]  Who knows what kind of meds he was on or what kind of meds he just got off.
[03:47:03.148 --> 03:47:05.730]  But again, no political motive whatsoever.
[03:47:05.730 --> 03:47:08.412]  Being white is not a political motive.
[03:47:08.412 --> 03:47:15.518]  Yet every time there's a mass shooting, we have to point this out again and again and again.
[03:47:15.518 --> 03:47:25.926]  Meanwhile in San Bernardino, for days and weeks afterwards, even as it became immediately clear that this was an Islamist terror attack, this was an act of jihad,
[03:47:27.165 --> 03:47:36.274]  The left continued and even Obama suggested, as much as a day afterwards, that it had more to do with workplace violence.
[03:47:36.274 --> 03:47:39.478]  So again, it's not related to the skin colour.
[03:47:39.478 --> 03:47:45.144]  It doesn't matter whether they're Arab, whether they're black or white, it's related to political motive.
[03:47:45.144 --> 03:47:49.948]  And again and again we have to point out the definition of terrorism.
[03:47:50.646 --> 03:48:04.794]  Because these people are so stupid they don't know what it is or will deliberately ignore what it means in order to be racist and identify an entire race of people as terrorists simply because of their skin color.
[03:48:06.681 --> 03:48:13.326]  Now, remaining on the argument of guns and gun control, of course we've heard that in the aftermath of this shooting in Michigan.
[03:48:13.326 --> 03:48:23.253]  Well, the CDC has come out with an inconvenient study in terms of the Obama administration's push for more gun control regulation.
[03:48:23.253 --> 03:48:29.337]  Americans are more likely to be killed by accidental poisoning and flu than by guns.
[03:48:29.337 --> 03:48:31.539]  This is a study that came out last week.
[03:48:31.539 --> 03:48:33.621]  It's received virtually no media attention.
[03:48:35.393 --> 03:48:38.376]  But the figures show that there were 33,636 firearms-related deaths in 2013, with 21,175 being suicides.
[03:48:38.376 --> 03:48:41.758]  So, to put this into context, you had 31,240 Americans who died in accidental falls.
[03:48:57.179 --> 03:49:06.082]  This means that Americans face a bigger threat from tripping in the shower or slipping on ice than they do being shot dead.
[03:49:06.082 --> 03:49:10.604]  And again, we have to point this out over and over whenever the stats come out.
[03:49:10.604 --> 03:49:21.747]  We have to point out the FBI statistics, the Department of Justice statistics that show gun violence in America has declined drastically since the 90s.
[03:49:21.747 --> 03:49:26.589]  But again, facts don't fit the agenda, so this is going to get ignored once again.
[03:49:27.540 --> 03:49:29.801]  And you can go down the list here.
[03:49:29.801 --> 03:49:35.903]  I mean, they don't even treat homicides as its own individual category.
[03:49:35.903 --> 03:49:39.545]  The number one killer of Americans is heart disease.
[03:49:39.545 --> 03:49:44.167]  611,000 deaths per year.
[03:49:44.167 --> 03:49:46.507]  And you can go down the list.
[03:49:46.507 --> 03:49:49.909]  Diseases, Alzheimer's, diabetes, flu and pneumonia.
[03:49:50.834 --> 03:49:54.737]  Kills 56,979 Americans a year.
[03:49:54.737 --> 03:49:59.220]  Again, far more than deliberate gun homicides.
[03:49:59.220 --> 03:50:04.845]  But you're not going to hear these statistics because they don't fit the current agenda.
[03:50:04.845 --> 03:50:16.273]  Now, of course, any gun death is horrible and we need to try and reduce that, but to claim that it's an exploding problem and that it's getting more and more severe is clearly disproven by these facts.
[03:50:16.273 --> 03:50:18.996]  So we've got that article up on Infowars.com.
[03:50:20.219 --> 03:50:23.382]  We were talking about this with Alex briefly.
[03:50:23.382 --> 03:50:34.871]  Basically, the French president came out and said that if the people of a European country vote in a, quote, far-right party, which is, of course, any party that isn't completely socialist like his government,
[03:50:35.788 --> 03:50:44.692]  That the EU should step in and just disregard those elections, as they've done with EU treaty votes, and suspend that country from the European Union.
[03:50:44.692 --> 03:50:50.154]  Again, annulling democracy in the name of protecting democracy.
[03:50:50.154 --> 03:50:52.295]  Completely chilling, completely Orwellian.
[03:50:52.295 --> 03:50:53.855]  We'll get into it more after the break.
[03:50:53.855 --> 03:50:56.196]  This is the Alex Jones Show live in Fulham.
[03:50:56.196 --> 03:50:57.157]  Talk to you later.
[03:50:58.601 --> 03:51:08.848]  Hello, my name is Don Whiskin from HeartDrop.com, the distributors of Xtendivite, the number one heart drop that people have been raving about for years.

[03:51:57.080 --> 03:52:00.724]  Brainforce, it's completely different.

[03:52:01.945 --> 03:52:03.527]  Rob Dew joins us.
[03:52:03.527 --> 03:52:06.370]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[03:52:06.370 --> 03:52:07.731]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[03:52:07.731 --> 03:52:08.692]  I've been working all day.
[03:52:08.692 --> 03:52:10.975]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[03:52:11.155 --> 03:52:13.116]  I get in here at 830.
[03:52:13.116 --> 03:52:14.477]  I was kind of run down.
[03:52:14.477 --> 03:52:16.439]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[03:52:16.439 --> 03:52:18.300]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[03:52:18.300 --> 03:52:20.141]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[03:52:20.141 --> 03:52:21.202]  I popped two of them.
[03:52:21.202 --> 03:52:25.445]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like everything just kind of clears up.
[03:52:25.445 --> 03:52:26.926]  It's got four and a half stars.
[03:52:26.926 --> 03:52:28.267]  People really love it.
[03:52:28.267 --> 03:52:28.867]  Read about it.
[03:52:28.867 --> 03:52:37.974]  Find out why third party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[03:52:38.134 --> 03:52:42.196]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[03:52:42.196 --> 03:52:48.339]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[03:52:48.339 --> 03:52:54.242]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:52:58.989 --> 03:53:00.992]  Are you sneezing, coughing, and aching?
[03:53:00.992 --> 03:53:04.917]  Do you have a sore throat, a fever, or the sniffles?

[03:53:30.303 --> 03:53:31.504]  Supernatural Silver.

[03:54:19.460 --> 03:54:22.721]  We are back, it's the final segment of the 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:54:22.721 --> 03:54:33.504]  So basically in the spirit of the European Union, which every time a country voted against joining a treaty, they simply annulled the vote and told them to vote again.
[03:54:33.504 --> 03:54:37.626]  Again, the democratic virtues of the European Union in full force.
[03:54:37.626 --> 03:54:48.089]  Now French President Hollande is saying, if the members of an EU state, if the voting public of an EU member state votes in a quote, far-right party,
[03:54:48.919 --> 03:54:51.281]  He's obviously referring to Marine Le Pen.
[03:54:51.281 --> 03:54:58.806]  Then the EU should simply annul that vote and ban that country from the EU.
[03:54:58.806 --> 03:55:05.951]  All in the name of protecting democracy by annulling the democratic will of the people of that country.
[03:55:05.951 --> 03:55:07.232]  Again, completely Orwellian.
[03:55:07.893 --> 03:55:11.335]  And why are people voting for, quote, far-right parties?
[03:55:11.335 --> 03:55:16.859]  Well, it's because the refugee crisis is now completely crippling Europe.
[03:55:16.859 --> 03:55:19.400]  We have this article out of Spicer.com.
[03:55:19.400 --> 03:55:25.264]  Norwegian government, we will abandon international law if Sweden collapses.
[03:55:25.264 --> 03:55:29.867]  Norway is ready to abandon the Geneva Convention if Sweden collapses.
[03:55:29.867 --> 03:55:36.952]  The border will be closed by force and Swedish refugees will be rejected without the possibility to seek asylum.
[03:55:37.657 --> 03:55:45.042]  So now the Norwegian government is openly talking about a collapse of Sweden because of this migrant influx.
[03:55:45.042 --> 03:55:52.247]  We have the German Interior Minister Thomas de Maziere saying that there are two weeks left to resolve the migration crisis.
[03:55:53.007 --> 03:55:56.769]  Before basically they have to shut down the border altogether.
[03:55:56.769 --> 03:55:59.491]  Which is what we reported last week.
[03:55:59.491 --> 03:56:03.074]  EU to close borders to refugees on March the 1st.
[03:56:03.074 --> 03:56:14.421]  This is getting so out of hand it shows no signs of abating that they could close down the border entirely to any refugees because again this is a completely failed policy.
[03:56:15.956 --> 03:56:25.773]  Again, going back to Sweden, we have the Gateway Pundit reporting, Swedish police admit there are now 53 no-go zones they dare not enter and cannot control.
[03:56:26.721 --> 03:56:36.625]  Danish reporter Jeppe Joll from Newspeak TV described the deteriorating situation in Sweden, a once peaceful country that is now regarded as the rape capital of the West.
[03:56:36.625 --> 03:56:40.746]  So the police have basically come out and admitted the conspiracy theory!
[03:56:40.746 --> 03:56:51.810]  Remember after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris they said that the idea of there being, you know, no-go Muslim ghetto areas was a conspiracy theory invented by the evil right-wing Fox News.
[03:56:51.810 --> 03:56:53.751]  They said the same thing about London
[03:56:54.682 --> 03:56:57.985]  Now the Swedish police are admitting it.
[03:56:57.985 --> 03:57:00.627]  Of course, we went into one in Molenbeek.
[03:57:00.627 --> 03:57:02.968]  Again, another conspiracy theory.
[03:57:02.968 --> 03:57:11.075]  ISIS has said that they want to bring in more refugees, radicalise them, and create more of these no-go areas as centres of power.
[03:57:12.065 --> 03:57:14.006]  And the backlash against that continues.
[03:57:14.006 --> 03:57:18.147]  We mentioned the refugee center in Germany.
[03:57:18.147 --> 03:57:20.528]  Germans cheer as refugee center burns.
[03:57:20.528 --> 03:57:24.470]  Crowds stop firefighters from extinguishing blaze.
[03:57:24.470 --> 03:57:26.811]  This is the point I've made over and over again.
[03:57:26.811 --> 03:57:33.133]  If you don't allow legitimate criticism from concerned citizens, if you team up with Facebook,
[03:57:33.493 --> 03:57:45.218]  and ex-Stasi members, as the German government has done, to censor criticism of this refugee policy, then you create a vacuum that will be filled by extremists.
[03:57:45.218 --> 03:57:50.580]  So you're going to see more and more of these refugee centres being attacked.
[03:57:50.580 --> 03:57:53.521]  And take this for an example of crushing free speech again.
[03:57:53.521 --> 03:57:58.323]  Dutch Pegida leader arrested for failing to take off a pick hat.
[03:57:58.323 --> 03:57:59.864]  I spoke about before the break, you know,
[03:58:00.916 --> 03:58:08.321]  Dutch people being visited, getting home visits from police for tweets saying their country's cyber policy is both bad and flat.
[03:58:08.321 --> 03:58:09.542]  This is what it's all about.
[03:58:09.542 --> 03:58:13.024]  It's pressure from above, pressure from below.
[03:58:13.024 --> 03:58:14.906]  This is only going to get worse.
[03:58:14.906 --> 03:58:16.667]  This is going to cause civil unrest.
[03:58:16.667 --> 03:58:20.569]  That's what top security experts throughout Europe are warning about.
[03:58:20.569 --> 03:58:26.954]  And it appears to be coming to a head over the next two weeks, with March 1st being that key watershed date.
[03:58:27.714 --> 03:58:29.437]  That's going to wrap it up for the show.
[03:58:29.437 --> 03:58:32.201]  Be sure to stay tuned for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:58:32.201 --> 03:58:35.386]  Alex will be back with a live show tomorrow, 11 to 2.
