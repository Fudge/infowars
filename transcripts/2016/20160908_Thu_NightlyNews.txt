[00:00:20.148 --> 00:00:20.949]  Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.031]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:24.052]  I'm Darren McBreen.
[00:00:24.072 --> 00:00:29.097]  Today is Thursday, September 8th, 2016, and here's a quick look at what's coming up.
[00:00:32.847 --> 00:00:43.069]  Tonight, while Obama scoffs at the idea of voter fraud, dismissing it as a conspiracy theory, the administration pushes its own conspiracy theory that Russia will tamper with our elections.
[00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:51.410]  The Secretary of Defense has threatened Russia to stay out of our elections, saying Putin has a clear ambition to erode the international order.
[00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.951]  And of course, Homeland Security's Jay Johnson has threatened to usurp control of our elections due to cyber vulnerability.
[00:01:01.792 --> 00:01:01.952]  Then,
[00:01:02.907 --> 00:01:06.208]  Was someone whispering sweet nothings in Hillary's ear last night?
[00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:16.853]  Actor James Woods has a viral tweet showing what looks like an inductive earpiece being worn by Hillary at last night's Commander-in-Chief forum.
[00:01:17.213 --> 00:01:24.556]  And True Pundit says New York Police Department sources involved with the forum's security detail confirmed she was wearing an inductive earpiece.
[00:01:24.936 --> 00:01:27.697]  All that and more on tonight's Enterhorse Nightly News.
[00:01:30.188 --> 00:01:34.592]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:01:34.672 --> 00:01:45.622]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:01:45.782 --> 00:01:50.705]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:53.327]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:01:53.407 --> 00:01:54.888]  It helps detoxify.
[00:01:55.088 --> 00:01:57.930]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.753]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:02:02.773 --> 00:02:06.916]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:02:07.316 --> 00:02:14.341]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:02:14.441 --> 00:02:15.882]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:02:16.062 --> 00:02:16.802]  This is so key.
[00:02:17.042 --> 00:02:21.345]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:02:21.385 --> 00:02:23.487]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:02:23.607 --> 00:02:27.069]  Exclusively available at m4warslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:02:30.251 --> 00:02:39.879]  Now we are introducing a new t-shirt, which I think folks need to get, telling the real truth about Bill Clinton, who is a serial rapist and a abuser of women.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.763]  In another case, it's about groping and fondling and touching against a woman's will.
[00:02:43.943 --> 00:02:44.323]  And rape.
[00:02:44.483 --> 00:02:44.864]  And rape.
[00:02:44.924 --> 00:02:49.107]  Bill rapes them physically, and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[00:02:49.147 --> 00:02:49.808]  He's a rapist.
[00:02:50.348 --> 00:02:50.749]  Absolutely.
[00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.070]  He's a public figure, he'd go straight to hell.
[00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.376]  Get your Bill Clinton rape shirt today at infowarstore.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:03:02.284 --> 00:03:11.351]  The Department of Homeland Security is threatening to take over the upcoming presidential election in the name of national security.
[00:03:11.811 --> 00:03:24.100]  Recently, DHS Secretary Jay Johnson told reporters that they are considering monitoring the election to ensure the integrity of the election.
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:38.784]  And this, of course, comes just weeks after Barack Hussein Obama criticized and even ridiculed Donald Trump for daring to cast his doubt on our nation's electoral process.
[00:03:39.304 --> 00:03:45.166]  And remember what Obama said, the federal government doesn't run the election process.
[00:03:45.486 --> 00:03:48.847]  I mean, you'd have to be a conspiracy theorist to believe that.
[00:03:50.248 --> 00:03:53.749]  The federal government doesn't run the election process.
[00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:57.451]  And I'm afraid the election's gonna be rigged, I have to be honest.
[00:03:58.412 --> 00:04:00.593]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[00:04:00.674 --> 00:04:01.434]  What does that mean?
[00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:03.716]  What is election fraud?
[00:04:04.196 --> 00:04:06.378]  Ha ha, like it doesn't even exist.
[00:04:06.578 --> 00:04:08.900]  This is the complete arrogance of these people.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:20.229]  If Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country,
[00:04:22.014 --> 00:04:24.356]  Including in places like Texas.
[00:04:26.298 --> 00:04:26.939]  That's ridiculous.
[00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.020]  That doesn't make any sense.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.962]  And I don't think anybody would take that seriously.
[00:04:31.246 --> 00:04:46.690]  So, while Obama says that voter fraud is a conspiracy theory, the White House is pushing their own conspiracy theory, claiming that the Russians might get involved and steal the election for Donald Trump.
[00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.131]  And that, my friends, that is a perfect excuse to get the DHS involved.
[00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:55.513]  And seize oversight of our elections.
[00:04:55.933 --> 00:05:08.542]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is taking all this nonsense even a step further, suggesting that the United States respond to any Russian cyber attacks with military force.
[00:05:09.682 --> 00:05:10.783]  You've seen reports.
[00:05:12.004 --> 00:05:13.725]  Russia's hacked into a lot of things.
[00:05:13.865 --> 00:05:15.386]  China's hacked into a lot of things.
[00:05:15.426 --> 00:05:17.988]  Russia even hacked into the Democratic National Committee.
[00:05:19.264 --> 00:05:22.228]  Maybe even some state election systems.
[00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:30.900]  As President, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.768]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[00:05:37.895 --> 00:05:51.787]  And I told you earlier that Jay Johnson, the DHS Secretary, he says that there is a plan to assume direct control of the presidential election by declaring it critical infrastructure.
[00:05:52.267 --> 00:06:00.614]  By the way, this is the same guy who appeared on MSNBC and said that he believes Donald Trump's policies are irresponsible and
[00:06:00.774 --> 00:06:03.576]  Unconstitutional and even un-American.
[00:06:03.936 --> 00:06:06.337]  So talk about a conflict of interest.
[00:06:06.637 --> 00:06:08.719]  He's already picking sides.
[00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:15.563]  That's the guy they want as the gatekeeper of election integrity in America.
[00:06:15.943 --> 00:06:17.124]  Give me a break.
[00:06:17.924 --> 00:06:24.130]  Meanwhile, the New York Times is reporting, just yesterday in fact, at Oxford University, U.S.
[00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:33.859]  Defense Secretary Ashton Carter accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of demonstrating a clear ambition to erode international order.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.145]  And he warned Russia to stay out of American elections.
[00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:53.963]  In one of the most blatant pieces of propaganda in US history, the Washington Post wants to sell America on the idea that the upcoming rigged elections by Obama and the DHS will be blamed solely on Vladimir Putin.
[00:06:54.103 --> 00:06:56.283]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[00:06:56.323 --> 00:06:57.104]  What does that mean?
[00:06:57.564 --> 00:07:02.325]  This is a kind of fundamental attack on the country itself, the underpinning of it, that
[00:07:02.945 --> 00:07:05.466]  The Washington Post writes, U.S.
[00:07:05.606 --> 00:07:10.327]  intelligence and law enforcement agencies are probing what they see as a broad, covert Russian operation.
[00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:30.633]  In the United States, to sow public distrust in the upcoming presidential election and in U.S.
[00:07:30.653 --> 00:07:43.618]  political institutions, the aim is to understand the scope and intent of the Russian campaign, which incorporates cyber tools to hack systems used in the political process, enhancing Russia's ability to spread disinformation.
[00:07:43.778 --> 00:07:53.122]  The effort to better understand Russia's covert influence operations is being spearheaded by James R. Clapper Jr., the Director of National Intelligence.
[00:07:53.402 --> 00:08:02.486]  This is something of concern for the DNI, said Charles Allen, a former long-time CIA officer who has been briefed on some of these issues.
[00:08:02.686 --> 00:08:03.786]  It is being addressed.
[00:08:04.007 --> 00:08:13.170]  The official cautioned that the intelligence community is not saying it has definitive proof of such tampering or any Russian plans to do so.
[00:08:13.331 --> 00:08:14.231]  But even the hint
[00:08:14.551 --> 00:08:15.992]  Let me get this straight.
[00:08:16.033 --> 00:08:22.178]  The American people are to place the future of our country in the hands of National Intelligence Director James Clapper.
[00:08:22.198 --> 00:08:25.541]  The same man that blatantly misled the American people when he lied to Congress
[00:08:39.995 --> 00:08:47.363]  Regarding the total dragnet our intelligence community wields on the supposed protections of our Bill of Rights.
[00:08:47.603 --> 00:08:55.231]  Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[00:08:56.612 --> 00:08:57.073]  No sir.
[00:08:58.514 --> 00:08:58.995]  It does not?
[00:09:00.956 --> 00:09:01.776]  Not wittingly.
[00:09:02.116 --> 00:09:03.436]  Now why do you say he was lying there?
[00:09:03.476 --> 00:09:19.479]  Because the letter that he sent to Congress admitted that they roam through the content of phone calls and the content of emails and the content of text messages without a warrant in direct contradiction to what he said to that Senate committee.
[00:09:19.739 --> 00:09:27.861]  I do think that when history looks at this, they're going to contrast the behavior of James Clapper, our National Intelligence Director, with Edward Snowden.
[00:09:28.817 --> 00:09:34.481]  Mr. Clapper lied in Congress, in defiance of the law, in the name of security.
[00:09:34.881 --> 00:09:37.723]  Mr. Snowden told the truth in the name of privacy.
[00:09:38.144 --> 00:09:46.750]  And the DHS is going to overrule powers given to local and state governments to manage their own elections under Article 1, Section 4 of the U.S.
[00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:57.337]  Constitution, not to mention the powers afforded states in the 10th Amendment, simply because DHS claims to be able to provide ironclad cybersecurity?
[00:09:57.617 --> 00:10:20.525]  Thousands of DHS employees were subjected to, as World Net Daily recently reported, the theft of social security numbers, dates of birth, residencies, educational and employment histories, personal foreign travel histories, immediate families, business and personal acquaintance details, and other information used to conduct background clearances.
[00:10:20.845 --> 00:10:29.189]  A mountain of evidence containing decades of collusion between our government and an elitist banking cabal sits collecting dust.
[00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:45.438]  Meanwhile, the American people are supposed to believe with zero proof that a foreign government will hack our elections, and that for the first time in US history, the electoral process must be hijacked by a dictatorial administration
[00:10:45.618 --> 00:10:53.245]  Well, I think it's more likely that the Democrats are coming because we've already caught the Democrats rigging elections and it's not just, you know, Obama
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.141]  It's not just a conspiracy theory.
[00:11:10.281 --> 00:11:11.822]  According to Obama, he's never even heard of it.
[00:11:11.842 --> 00:11:15.063]  I mean, these things are so elusive and so rare, he's never even heard of rigged elections.
[00:11:15.403 --> 00:11:19.646]  But actually, we have Barack Obama who is tied to ACORN.
[00:11:20.006 --> 00:11:22.607]  Now, we have dozens of these cases, Darren, okay?
[00:11:22.627 --> 00:11:24.948]  But I picked out a couple of my favorites here.
[00:11:25.969 --> 00:11:31.011]  Over 3,000 fraudulent voter registrations were filed by ACORN in St.
[00:11:31.051 --> 00:11:32.112]  Louis, my hometown.
[00:11:32.612 --> 00:11:38.697]  In Pennsylvania, officials threw out almost 60,000 voter registrations that were filed by ACORN.
[00:11:39.317 --> 00:11:45.262]  And then in Texas, almost 10,000 ACORN-submitted registrations were found invalid.
[00:11:45.322 --> 00:11:47.584]  So this is almost, you know, we're up around 70,000.
[00:11:50.586 --> 00:11:57.474]  Fake ballots trying to be cast by ACORN, but Obama says he has no idea what a rigged election is.
[00:11:57.714 --> 00:11:58.254]  It goes on.
[00:11:58.334 --> 00:12:04.882]  Not just have ACORN been caught trying to submit fake registrations, they've had employees be indicted.
[00:12:04.962 --> 00:12:07.725]  Four ACORN employees were indicted in Kansas City.
[00:12:08.105 --> 00:12:10.147]  Eight ACORN employees were indicted in St.
[00:12:10.187 --> 00:12:10.488]  Louis.
[00:12:10.908 --> 00:12:16.669]  You had Nevada authorities indict Acorn on 26 counts of voter registration.
[00:12:16.789 --> 00:12:18.990]  Seven Acorn workers in Pittsburgh.
[00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.430]  So it just goes on and on.
[00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:22.471]  So it's not the Russians are coming, Darren.
[00:12:22.871 --> 00:12:24.551]  It's that the Democrats are coming.
[00:12:24.751 --> 00:12:25.111]  And guess what?
[00:12:25.131 --> 00:12:27.212]  They're coming under a pseudonym you've heard of before.
[00:12:27.912 --> 00:12:29.952]  This is a joke to the Democrats.
[00:12:29.972 --> 00:12:31.092]  They don't even take this seriously.
[00:12:31.372 --> 00:12:37.934]  They tried to register Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and the entire Cowboys starting lineup to vote.
[00:12:38.334 --> 00:12:40.436]  In the 2008 presidential election.
[00:12:40.476 --> 00:12:44.800]  So I think it's the Democrats that are coming to rig this election, not the Russians.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.201]  But isn't that the theme, though, Darren?
[00:12:46.561 --> 00:12:47.742]  It's the Russians' fault for everything.
[00:12:47.762 --> 00:12:48.943]  Well, it's the Russians' fault for everything.
[00:12:49.003 --> 00:12:55.349]  I was going to tell you that my mom voted Republican her entire life, until the day she died.
[00:12:55.929 --> 00:12:57.431]  And then she started voting Democrat.
[00:12:57.731 --> 00:12:58.511]  Well that's typical.
[00:12:58.651 --> 00:13:09.356]  But let me tell you something, we know that the Republicans are responsible for voter fraud in the past too, especially now that the electronic voting systems are in place.
[00:13:09.896 --> 00:13:17.879]  It is just a recipe for disaster, so the elections can be thrown any direction, any way the establishment wants them to.
[00:13:18.659 --> 00:13:32.068]  I think it's very alarming to hear all this rhetoric about the Russians possibly stealing the election, because if Donald Trump were to win, they can always say, hey, it was rigged, man, and we can't allow this, and then what's going to happen?
[00:13:32.268 --> 00:13:35.070]  Well, and that's probably what they're going to say.
[00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.471]  And we already see the UN taking over the internet.
[00:13:38.511 --> 00:13:41.452]  We already see DHS saying they want to watch the elections.
[00:13:41.973 --> 00:13:49.216]  This to me has signs of false flag cyber security terror attack written all over it.
[00:13:49.476 --> 00:13:59.740]  They blame Trump winning on the Russians hacking the election and then the UN and whatever federal bureaucracy they want comes in takes complete control over the internet and you know what they'll do next?
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.581]  They're going to try to shut us down.
[00:14:01.601 --> 00:14:03.481]  They're going to try to shut Drudge Report down.
[00:14:03.501 --> 00:14:05.382]  And they're going to try to shut you down.
[00:14:05.782 --> 00:14:11.224]  You won't be allowed to operate because your content is going to need to be censored.
[00:14:11.464 --> 00:14:14.225]  You know, oh, like YouTube just is demonetizing.
[00:14:14.506 --> 00:14:15.486]  That's just phase one there.
[00:14:15.506 --> 00:14:18.307]  And they will say Donald Trump is a sore loser.
[00:14:18.487 --> 00:14:24.609]  Meanwhile, let's not forget what Joseph Stalin once said, the people who cast the votes decide nothing.
[00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.611]  The people who count the votes decide everything.
[00:14:32.029 --> 00:14:35.190]  You said in a speech today you're afraid this election is going to be rigged.
[00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.271]  I've been hearing about it for a long time.
[00:14:37.411 --> 00:14:40.192]  I hope the Republicans get out there and watch very closely.
[00:14:40.212 --> 00:14:42.893]  This new poll is showing a big convention bounce for Hillary Clinton.
[00:14:42.993 --> 00:14:46.994]  Following her nomination at the Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton now leads it.
[00:14:47.334 --> 00:14:48.935]  Donald Trump, 50% to 42%.
[00:14:49.335 --> 00:14:52.056]  That's a 7-point jump from last week.
[00:14:52.176 --> 00:14:54.617]  You see, he's supposed to just sit there and let them steal it.
[00:14:54.797 --> 00:14:56.358]  But he didn't sit there, so they failed.
[00:14:58.001 --> 00:15:05.028]  And they think they're gonna have another stolen general election in front of everybody at high noon, and we're just gonna sit here and go along with it.
[00:15:05.168 --> 00:15:05.588]  We're not.
[00:15:06.569 --> 00:15:07.270]  I'm gonna fight it.
[00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:08.371]  Trump's gonna fight it.
[00:15:08.651 --> 00:15:09.332]  You're gonna fight it.
[00:15:09.512 --> 00:15:11.534]  Bob Mulholland from Chico, California.
[00:15:11.554 --> 00:15:14.757]  I'm a DNC member, thus a superdelegate to the National Convention.
[00:15:15.057 --> 00:15:15.818]  First of all, it's rigged.
[00:15:16.398 --> 00:15:18.881]  And I'm afraid the election's gonna be rigged, I have to be honest.
[00:15:19.525 --> 00:15:24.391]  And the way we work is that anybody who gets 15% more in an election gets delegates.
[00:15:24.551 --> 00:15:26.533]  So this election will go all the way to California.
[00:15:26.913 --> 00:15:30.618]  Sanders will end up with well over 1,000 delegates and Hillary will get the nomination.
[00:15:30.878 --> 00:15:39.568]  Hillary Clinton has had every advantage, every break given to her from the very beginning by this Democratic Party.
[00:15:39.668 --> 00:15:40.569]  It has been rigged.
[00:15:40.729 --> 00:15:54.975]  It is clearly the case that when given truth serum, Debbie Wasserman Schultz vastly prefers Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, obviously, and to the extent there are things that can be done institutionally and marginally to facilitate that outcome, they are being done.
[00:15:55.135 --> 00:16:03.358]  If Hillary steals the nomination, and then she openly is engaged in chicanery and things don't add up with Trump, you have to say it must be thrown out.
[00:16:03.738 --> 00:16:06.560]  The political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[00:16:07.521 --> 00:16:08.962]  Contrary to popular belief.
[00:16:09.422 --> 00:16:10.923]  Then why are they holding the primaries?
[00:16:11.924 --> 00:16:13.144]  That's a very good question.
[00:16:13.204 --> 00:16:17.047]  WikiLeaks has dumped nearly 20,000 hacked emails from the DNC.
[00:16:17.067 --> 00:16:24.252]  We're talking about the report of leaked DNC emails showing an effort to undermine Bernie Sanders during the primaries.
[00:16:24.592 --> 00:16:28.955]  The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.
[00:16:29.675 --> 00:16:34.619]  When did the press see it as their role to protect the prerogative of the powerful?
[00:16:34.679 --> 00:16:35.680]  Actually, I think that's part of it.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.623]  And we're not going to recognize Queen Hillary if there's evidence of fraud.
[00:16:39.944 --> 00:16:40.844]  And guess what there is?
[00:16:41.065 --> 00:16:42.966]  She stole the nomination.
[00:16:43.266 --> 00:16:46.009]  I want to thank Bernie Sanders.
[00:16:46.989 --> 00:16:51.853]  If he would have just not done anything, just go home, go to sleep, relax, he would have been a hero.
[00:16:51.993 --> 00:16:53.755]  But he made a deal with the devil.
[00:16:53.775 --> 00:16:54.355]  She's the devil.
[00:16:54.716 --> 00:16:55.777]  He made a deal with the devil.
[00:16:57.216 --> 00:17:03.161]  The media has created the perception that the voters will decide the nomination, and that's the conflict here.
[00:17:03.201 --> 00:17:05.162]  We feel like we live in a democratic society.
[00:17:05.182 --> 00:17:10.487]  What you're telling me is it's not a democratic society, and your votes don't necessarily matter because it's a democratic representation.
[00:17:10.587 --> 00:17:12.829]  Crooked Hillary thinks they're going to pull what they did on Mitt Romney?
[00:17:13.209 --> 00:17:14.990]  Mm, lady, isn't going to happen.
[00:17:15.191 --> 00:17:20.315]  That's why her campaign head, her chief strategist said, this is dangerous what Trump's doing.
[00:17:20.695 --> 00:17:22.096]  You're right, it is dangerous, isn't it?
[00:17:22.757 --> 00:17:24.058]  Actually standing up to you.
[00:17:24.438 --> 00:17:26.780]  I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.964]  And I'm telling you, November 8th, we better be careful, because that election's gonna be rigged.
[00:17:31.184 --> 00:17:31.424]  Yes.
[00:17:32.125 --> 00:17:36.188]  I think the Republican nominee is unfit to serve as president.
[00:17:36.629 --> 00:17:40.412]  And I hope the Republicans are watching closely, or it's gonna be taken away from us.
[00:17:40.552 --> 00:17:49.180]  You're gonna be hearing a lot more about this, ladies and gentlemen, because Donald Trump's not gonna let you be robbed, myself be robbed, or him be robbed, or his family.
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.143]  There has to come a point at which you say, enough.
[00:17:59.705 --> 00:18:01.566]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[00:18:01.626 --> 00:18:03.507]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[00:18:03.607 --> 00:18:06.329]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:07.349]  Alex Jones.
[00:18:07.429 --> 00:18:10.191]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:18:10.251 --> 00:18:13.452]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:18:13.493 --> 00:18:14.733]  Deeply I think racist.
[00:18:14.753 --> 00:18:16.754]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[00:18:16.854 --> 00:18:18.655]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[00:18:18.675 --> 00:18:22.758]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[00:18:22.778 --> 00:18:23.938]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:23.998 --> 00:18:28.581]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:18:32.651 --> 00:18:44.798]  Intruder alert!
[00:18:45.919 --> 00:18:49.841]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:18:49.861 --> 00:19:02.009]  These people are coming for everybody!
[00:19:12.199 --> 00:19:15.863]  He who controls the trends, controls the future.
[00:19:16.683 --> 00:19:20.787]  He who controls the future, controls the destiny of humanity.
[00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:34.321]  My friends, the globalist social engineers are obsessed with creating false memes, false trends that they control.
[00:19:36.929 --> 00:19:44.792]  To create a population of trendies from those false trends that don't have their own destiny.
[00:19:45.752 --> 00:20:01.477]  Who don't even have a basic organic human genetic drive to build something that is satisfying, trailblazing, and innately independent and human.
[00:20:02.492 --> 00:20:07.116]  And if you understand this paradigm, you understand all the others.
[00:20:07.657 --> 00:20:20.369]  One of hundreds of memes and trends we've been successfully able to launch and force into the consciousness is a Operation Against Hillary Clinton we launched 10 months ago with the Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.072]  It's now been duplicated by countless groups and I think that's wonderful.
[00:20:25.034 --> 00:20:31.958]  Imitation is the greatest form of flattery, and now it's all over CNN, it's all over Fox, it's all over the Trump rallies, the Hillary rallies.
[00:20:32.299 --> 00:20:39.383]  The number one search term for a week straight, last week, and still continuing, one of the top search terms is, is Hillary going to jail?
[00:20:39.723 --> 00:20:41.825]  This has been incredibly successful.
[00:20:42.105 --> 00:20:46.468]  Because it shows, despite corporate control, and despite them trying to control the meme,
[00:20:47.068 --> 00:21:03.960]  We are able to synergistically wear our colors loud and proud against injustice, corruption, and oppression, and show that we, humans, not the globalist controllers, but the common little people, can set the trends, can set the memes.
[00:21:04.821 --> 00:21:07.142]  We've had three versions of the Hillary for Prison shirt.
[00:21:07.662 --> 00:21:11.083]  All of them have been collector's edition and have helped fund the InfoWar.
[00:21:11.664 --> 00:21:14.225]  We now have a third edition in.
[00:21:14.465 --> 00:21:15.785]  The second edition sold out.
[00:21:16.145 --> 00:21:32.692]  It's the same as the last, but on the right shoulder says InfoWars.com, on the back it says InfoWars.com, legalized freedom, be part of history, be part of supporting the InfoWar, be part of meeting like-minded friends and family.
[00:21:33.809 --> 00:21:49.114]  And be part of breaking out of their paradigm and setting the agenda, setting the trend, setting the true, organic, teleprompter-free reawakening of humanity.

[00:22:02.073 --> 00:22:02.874]  Come on, Hillary.
[00:22:03.054 --> 00:22:03.655]  Just a little.
[00:22:03.935 --> 00:22:04.736]  Just a little sip.
[00:22:05.297 --> 00:22:05.597]  Open up.
[00:22:05.897 --> 00:22:06.778]  Come on, take it!
[00:22:07.299 --> 00:22:07.679]  Take it!
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.401]  I'm running for president.
[00:22:09.802 --> 00:22:12.986]  Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.
[00:22:13.006 --> 00:22:17.431]  I'm hitting the road to earn your vote, and I hope you'll join me on this journey.
[00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:08.035]  I'm David Knight with Joe Biggs, and today we've had another Tesla fatal crash.
[00:23:08.075 --> 00:23:10.478]  Now this one happened near Amsterdam.
[00:23:11.218 --> 00:23:17.585]  This was a death by fire, but they say a crash was involved, and of course it brings up the question as to whether or not autopilot is involved.
[00:23:17.625 --> 00:23:24.373]  Tesla is saying there is no autopilot involved in this crash, Joe, but they said that about the other fatal crash, which by the way,
[00:23:24.913 --> 00:23:27.797]  They didn't make it public for a couple of months.
[00:23:27.837 --> 00:23:32.703]  It was more than 60 days they kept that private, and they were very active in the stock market.
[00:23:32.723 --> 00:23:36.388]  They now have a multi-million dollar lawsuit from a stockholder against them.
[00:23:36.408 --> 00:23:40.453]  They're being investigated by the SEC, not just the transportation boards.
[00:23:40.513 --> 00:23:41.654]  They're being investigated by the SEC.
[00:23:42.515 --> 00:23:50.238]  Saying that they kept that quiet, that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also worked with them to keep it secret.
[00:23:50.258 --> 00:23:51.519]  We'll call that NHTSA.
[00:23:51.559 --> 00:23:53.239]  That's how we'll refer to them from here on out.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.581]  But of course, this is a large number of aspects to this.
[00:23:57.621 --> 00:23:59.702]  There's the electric battery aspect of it.
[00:23:59.802 --> 00:24:01.803]  There's the autopilot aspect of it.
[00:24:02.323 --> 00:24:05.364]  And there's the crony capital aspect of it that we have involved here.
[00:24:05.424 --> 00:24:09.626]  But the first thing that both of us look at when we see this is Michael Hastings, isn't it?
[00:24:10.097 --> 00:24:10.758]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:10.798 --> 00:24:12.499]  I mean, we saw what happened to Michael Hastings.
[00:24:12.539 --> 00:24:16.262]  I mean, the way he was driving that night was completely and totally out of the ordinary.
[00:24:16.502 --> 00:24:18.343]  This vehicle was speeding down the road.
[00:24:18.704 --> 00:24:30.633]  You see it flash, then flash again, explode, and here you are, the front of the car is completely demolished, burnt, only the back end pretty much left intact, just like what we saw outside of the Netherlands.
[00:24:30.913 --> 00:24:35.616]  This man died with his autopilot electric car collided when it hit a tree and burst into flames.
[00:24:35.636 --> 00:24:38.699]  The firefighters took hours to remove the body from the Tesla.
[00:24:39.179 --> 00:24:47.809]  Over fears they could be electrocuted, like you said, so you've got this autopilot fear, and you've got this electronic fear of being electrocuted, so forth and so on.
[00:24:48.229 --> 00:24:53.676]  And before we get away from Michael Hastings, again, when we said that, everybody said, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:24:54.176 --> 00:24:56.877]  Nobody could take over his car and make it go really fast.
[00:24:56.917 --> 00:25:01.617]  Nobody could blow his car up, and yet the engine was ejected down the road, not captured.
[00:25:01.657 --> 00:25:12.039]  It was a frontal collision into some trees, which would have pushed the engine into the car, and yet the engine flew 100 feet, or whatever it was, down the highway in the direction that he was going.
[00:25:12.259 --> 00:25:20.181]  His car went in there, and there was no involvement in the fuel tank in the back, and he had told people that he was concerned that his car was going to be hacked.
[00:25:20.221 --> 00:25:21.901]  Everybody said he drove like a granny.
[00:25:22.321 --> 00:25:26.303]  Yes, I mean, days prior, they saw him looking under his car.
[00:25:26.623 --> 00:25:30.445]  His neighbor even confirmed that she had seen him looking under the car.
[00:25:30.745 --> 00:25:35.607]  And at one time, Michael had even asked if he could borrow her car to run some errands in.
[00:25:35.647 --> 00:25:36.828]  So there was definitely some concern.
[00:25:37.128 --> 00:25:44.551]  You know, the more electronic we go with these vehicles, there's more of a chance that something like this is going to happen, whether it be hacking or something like that.
[00:25:44.651 --> 00:25:48.773]  So that's definitely a cause for concern, something that people, buyers, need to look into.
[00:25:49.273 --> 00:26:03.869]  And that is a real concern, because we've had now, two years in a row, we've had hackers of the Black Hat Conference go in and show how they can take over a car, they can speed it up, they can take over the steering, they can take over the brakes, they can do all the stuff that we said, hey, they're doing it, and of course, Richard Clark said at the time,
[00:26:04.369 --> 00:26:05.290]  Yeah, that can be done.
[00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:11.352]  He said that a little bit after that, and then after that we found out that there was real motivation for people in the government to stop Michael Hastings.
[00:26:11.372 --> 00:26:14.474]  So that's one aspect of it, is the hacking, the maliciousness of it.
[00:26:14.734 --> 00:26:18.916]  But let's talk about the subsystems and the other things that are concerned about this.
[00:26:18.976 --> 00:26:22.458]  Earlier in the week, we had an article on Infowars.com from Kit Daniels
[00:26:23.138 --> 00:26:29.941]  And it was a quote from the National Traffic Safety Board Chief, who said, fully autonomous cars are very unlikely.
[00:26:29.981 --> 00:26:37.005]  He was speaking at MIT, and he says, I'm not confident that we will ever reach the point of fully autonomous cars.
[00:26:37.025 --> 00:26:40.766]  I don't see the ideal of complete automation coming anytime soon.
[00:26:41.187 --> 00:26:46.089]  Some people just like to drive, some people don't trust the automation, so they're not going to want to drive.
[00:26:46.129 --> 00:26:50.511]  He said, there's no software designer in the world that is ever going to be smart enough
[00:26:50.791 --> 00:26:50.991]  I think so.
[00:27:05.708 --> 00:27:08.530]  What they're going to do is move human error to another level.
[00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:13.532]  They're going to give government control over your movements to control and track you.
[00:27:13.993 --> 00:27:15.273]  And that's the true issue.
[00:27:15.353 --> 00:27:19.996]  And if they're going to have autopilot, as a matter of fact, Tesla has stopped calling it autopilot.
[00:27:20.036 --> 00:27:21.057]  They're moving that back.
[00:27:21.097 --> 00:27:22.297]  They're getting away from that term.
[00:27:22.858 --> 00:27:26.800]  They said in this accident today that autopilot was not involved.
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.821]  But they said that for over a month.
[00:27:28.961 --> 00:27:33.544]  After it finally became public, two months after it happened, they said autopilot was not involved.
[00:27:34.286 --> 00:27:39.070]  When NHTSA did their investigation, they found that it was involved.
[00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:44.454]  And so then Tesla came back and said, well, it was the brakes that failed, not the autopilot software.
[00:27:44.474 --> 00:27:45.835]  So again, it keeps going around.
[00:27:45.875 --> 00:27:50.078]  But let's talk about this other aspect, and that is the danger of the batteries.
[00:27:50.418 --> 00:27:55.142]  Because just as we've seen laptops catch fire, just as we've seen cell phones catch fire,
[00:27:55.282 --> 00:28:01.965]  We've had situations in the past where Nissan Leafs have caught fire and burned entire houses down as they were charging.
[00:28:02.505 --> 00:28:11.749]  And just back in the middle of August, not in Amsterdam, not in the Netherlands, but in France, somebody was taking a test drive in a Tesla in France.
[00:28:12.289 --> 00:28:17.732]  And what happened, they say the vehicle supposedly made a loud noise, sent a warning on the dashboard there was a problem with the charging.
[00:28:18.212 --> 00:28:20.833]  There was an employee in the car with a person taking the test drives.
[00:28:20.853 --> 00:28:21.693]  I'd pull this over.
[00:28:22.034 --> 00:28:25.395]  They got out very quickly and the car instantly caught fire.
[00:28:25.435 --> 00:28:29.256]  Before the fire department could get there, there was absolutely nothing left.
[00:28:29.337 --> 00:28:30.317]  It was incinerated.
[00:28:30.717 --> 00:28:32.218]  So that's another aspect of it.
[00:28:32.238 --> 00:28:37.860]  So you not only have the autopilot software, you also have the electric battery itself that's a danger.
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:48.249]  Well, Mobilize, a company that supplies the equipment for Tesla's autopilot, and they said that they're not going to be working with Tesla in the future based off of these accidents that are starting to occur time and time again.
[00:28:48.589 --> 00:28:50.972]  So like you said, these guys are going to kind of pull back and say, you know what?
[00:28:51.272 --> 00:28:53.133]  This is going to be a huge issue for us.
[00:28:53.454 --> 00:28:54.555]  We don't want any part of this.
[00:28:55.126 --> 00:29:01.948]  I think what we're seeing in these multiple accidents is an attitude from Tesla that we have seen for a long time from Silicon Valley.
[00:29:02.408 --> 00:29:07.270]  And that is they're going to put stuff out there, in many cases they'll put software that really isn't adequately tested.
[00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:12.532]  And they'll let people give them feedback and that's how they'll do the beta testing on this.
[00:29:13.132 --> 00:29:17.756]  That's fine if you're working with a situation where all that's going to happen is you're going to lose some data when it crashes.
[00:29:17.836 --> 00:29:22.659]  But you're inside this thing, and when it crashes, you crash and die with it.
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.661]  That kind of attitude does not work.
[00:29:24.781 --> 00:29:33.648]  And when you turn on the autopilot, you click and say, I understand that this is a beta test or whatever, except for the people around you.
[00:29:33.848 --> 00:29:35.569]  I haven't signed on to that beta test.
[00:29:35.629 --> 00:29:37.230]  I didn't sign on to the beta test with this.
[00:29:37.711 --> 00:29:42.274]  And you look at this other recent crash that happened, was it a couple of weeks ago here in Texas?
[00:29:42.934 --> 00:29:49.699]  This was a man who had his autopilot on, Mark Mulfan, and he said that he had done this route before.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.180]  He was trusting autopilot.
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.182]  He reached into his glove compartment to get something.
[00:29:53.842 --> 00:29:58.108]  And it struck a guardrail and it did it multiple times, okay?
[00:29:58.168 --> 00:30:01.231]  He said it actually sped up after the first crash.
[00:30:01.271 --> 00:30:02.092]  And this is what he said.
[00:30:02.493 --> 00:30:04.916]  He said, it gives you a false sense of security.
[00:30:05.016 --> 00:30:06.497]  I'm not ready to be a test pilot.
[00:30:06.798 --> 00:30:07.599]  It missed the curve.
[00:30:07.699 --> 00:30:09.000]  It drove straight in the guardrail.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:09.881]  The car didn't stop.
[00:30:09.921 --> 00:30:13.546]  It actually continued to accelerate after the first impact in the guardrail.
[00:30:13.766 --> 00:30:20.872]  I mean, one of the interesting things to think about though, is what if you're behind on child support, or what if all of a sudden there's a warrant that comes down for your arrest?
[00:30:21.273 --> 00:30:24.555]  The government is the one that's building this software.
[00:30:24.796 --> 00:30:30.280]  These are the people that are going to have control of the back doors of these things, and that's what's dangerous about these electronic cars.
[00:30:30.581 --> 00:30:37.207]  The fact that these guys can go in, find your vehicle, they can track your movements, shut you down, if they don't like what you're saying, drive you off a cliff.
[00:30:37.687 --> 00:30:39.569]  So it's definitely something that people
[00:30:40.189 --> 00:30:44.571]  We've already had the government come in and say, hey, if you're behind on your taxes, you're not going to get out of the country.
[00:30:44.651 --> 00:30:45.111]  Exactly.
[00:30:45.191 --> 00:30:50.474]  They're going to say, if you're behind in payments to the IRS or what, you're not going to go anywhere.
[00:30:50.494 --> 00:30:52.374]  You're going to be under house arrest, essentially.
[00:30:52.715 --> 00:30:54.275]  And that's what is so dangerous about it.
[00:30:54.375 --> 00:31:00.218]  And that, Joe, is why I believe the government is working so hard to make this happen.
[00:31:00.678 --> 00:31:12.481]  They want to work with the corporations because it gives them control over your movements, to be able to track you, to be able to tax you with all of your movements, and to be able to shut your movements completely down.
[00:31:12.781 --> 00:31:20.803]  That's one of the reasons why Tesla is involved, as others have pointed out, as Eric Peter called him, the crony capitalist king.
[00:31:22.323 --> 00:31:28.029]  Elon Musk has gotten almost $5 billion in subsidies as a crony capitalist.
[00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:34.536]  And one of the things that he gets are CARB credits, the California Air Resources Board.
[00:31:35.276 --> 00:31:37.779]  They give these zero emission vehicle credits.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.040]  Yeah.
[00:31:53.797 --> 00:31:54.518]  We're good to go.
[00:32:14.057 --> 00:32:17.219]  Saying that we're going to do this because these vehicles are electric.
[00:32:17.239 --> 00:32:21.701]  And again, we see now two fires, most likely due to them being electric.
[00:32:22.101 --> 00:32:34.687]  And he said back in December, he and his executive, one of the executive officers of his company, that when the scandal broke with Volkswagen, they should be forced to make electric vehicles and banned from making diesel vehicles.
[00:32:35.127 --> 00:32:38.989]  Even though diesels don't have any emissions the way that they're building them in Europe now.
[00:32:39.309 --> 00:32:41.390]  Well, we're going to have more reports as this develops.
[00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:43.232]  I'm sure there's going to be more incidents with this.
[00:32:43.332 --> 00:32:49.876]  And I'm sure that there's no truth to the rumor that the car was heard shouting, Auto Car Akbar, as it drove into the tree.
[00:32:50.316 --> 00:32:52.758]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight with Joe Biggs.
[00:33:02.526 --> 00:33:07.990]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:09.031]  Unveiled!
[00:33:09.431 --> 00:33:12.493]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula.
[00:33:13.174 --> 00:33:13.634]  30 servings.
[00:33:13.834 --> 00:33:16.436]  Fruit punch flavor dietary supplement.
[00:33:16.736 --> 00:33:17.797]  It is simply amazing.
[00:33:17.857 --> 00:33:18.818]  Infowarslife.com
[00:33:19.198 --> 00:33:23.600]  There's a million different products like this out there, but they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:37.227]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all of the essential amino acids, all of the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:38.808]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:40.029]  I put it in my protein shake.
[00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:46.133]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:49.175]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:51.456]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[00:33:52.057 --> 00:33:58.201]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:00.783]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[00:34:01.143 --> 00:34:03.004]  Okay, this... Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:03.484]  Yeah.
[00:34:03.584 --> 00:34:05.346]  I wanna... But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:05.726]  Yeah.
[00:34:05.946 --> 00:34:07.447]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:10.349]  There's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com that are excellent.
[00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:11.909]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.152]  This is just the very best we can bring you, and when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:39.919]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body, because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:41.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:41.087 --> 00:34:44.228]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[00:34:44.328 --> 00:34:45.568]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:46.168]  Tell folks about that.
[00:34:46.328 --> 00:34:49.088]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.589]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:55.670]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine.
[00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.510]  Each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.131]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:04.691]  34 other ones you can check out.
[00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.731]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:09.552]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:19.939]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just by the way look on the other side too because we're showing people the minerals and things let's look at the vitamins right there old Scott in there I mean it's amazing.
[00:35:19.979 --> 00:35:20.440]  Top left.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.862]  Again if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.285]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's the other source?
[00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.707]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:32.806]  Retinol.
[00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:37.328]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[00:35:37.649 --> 00:35:38.049]  And you know what?
[00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:40.290]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.110]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:48.154]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:53.997]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:55.358]  So get them today!
[00:35:55.418 --> 00:35:59.441]  Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:00.442 --> 00:36:01.983]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:36:02.363 --> 00:36:08.288]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[00:36:08.508 --> 00:36:09.649]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:25.219]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:29.582]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:36:33.604 --> 00:36:40.690]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:36:41.031 --> 00:36:46.696]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:36:46.896 --> 00:36:53.022]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[00:36:53.322 --> 00:36:57.065]  Check them out today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[00:37:05.063 --> 00:37:09.025]  Well, it turns out President Obama was watching the Commander-in-Chief Forum last night.
[00:37:09.065 --> 00:37:10.825]  He had some choice words for Donald Trump.
[00:37:11.306 --> 00:37:12.346]  Some jabs, if you will.
[00:37:12.386 --> 00:37:14.207]  He called him wacky and uninformed.
[00:37:14.227 --> 00:37:18.889]  Now, this following the question posed to Trump, asking him if he thought Putin was a good leader.
[00:37:18.909 --> 00:37:22.230]  And he said, yes, he's certainly a better leader than the one we have.
[00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:24.731]  Of course, Trump is talking American jobs today.
[00:37:25.311 --> 00:37:25.891]  Thank you so much.
[00:37:42.037 --> 00:37:42.418]  I don't
[00:37:56.834 --> 00:37:58.374]  You actually have to know what you're talking about.
[00:37:58.434 --> 00:38:00.595]  You actually have to do your homework.
[00:38:00.635 --> 00:38:01.635]  I'm paraphrasing here.
[00:38:01.955 --> 00:38:02.835]  You have to speak.
[00:38:02.995 --> 00:38:06.836]  It should actually reflect thought out policy you can implement.
[00:38:07.216 --> 00:38:10.977]  Well, policies, for example, like the ones he's implementing and bad trade deals.
[00:38:11.037 --> 00:38:18.178]  Speaking of jobs here in this country, he's ramming through the passage of the TPP meeting with the Chinese, of course, during the Asian summit.
[00:38:18.618 --> 00:38:20.519]  And that's on his high priority list.
[00:38:21.499 --> 00:38:29.122]  Fast tracking of this bad trade agreement, it's going to axe even more jobs, to which I'm sure he's just going to go around calling American workers lazy.
[00:38:29.263 --> 00:38:34.485]  Now, the average American worker last year, the median income was just under $29,000.
[00:38:34.905 --> 00:38:43.049]  As I mentioned before, Trump has taken on the jobs issue today, doing a press conference and talking about the options that Americans have.
[00:38:43.869 --> 00:38:47.311]  Meanwhile, our own president is globally calling all of us lazy.
[00:38:47.331 --> 00:38:56.057]  Not mentioning those bad trade deals, though, that strengthen developing countries and their workforce and keep ours in the poorhouse.
[00:38:56.497 --> 00:38:58.939]  I'm Margaret Halver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:39:12.927 --> 00:39:15.470]  Globalism already exists in the United States.
[00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:23.278]  Sprawled out behind me is 31,708 acres of the Balcones Canyonland Wildlife Preserve.
[00:39:23.698 --> 00:39:33.308]  The preserve is under the authorization of the 1973 Endangered Species Act, basically an extension of the United Nations Agenda 21.
[00:39:34.503 --> 00:39:42.349]  Even though Austin's population grows by 110 people every day, development of this prime acreage is not permitted.
[00:39:42.849 --> 00:39:54.217]  And furthermore, with the United Nations' recent implementation of Agenda 2030, the globalist reach is finding its way into our very neighborhoods and lives.
[00:39:54.457 --> 00:40:00.822]  President Obama didn't go on a tour of Asia just to be consistently insulted for being a globalist pawn.
[00:40:01.082 --> 00:40:09.508]  Obama was attending the G20 in Hangzhou, China, signing away the fleeting remnants of the United States sovereignty over to the globalist 2030 agenda.
[00:40:10.769 --> 00:40:24.429]  Among the totalitarian horror this agenda includes are mandatory vaccinations worldwide under the guidance of Bill Gates, the unleashing of GMO technology on the natural world in the guise of feeding the hungry,
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:27.641]  I mean, genetically modified sounds Frankenstein-ish.
[00:40:28.121 --> 00:40:31.522]  Drought resistance sounds really something you want.
[00:40:31.962 --> 00:40:48.748]  Carbon taxes that will increase poverty and create a surf-like energy consumption, an introduction of a global tax that will make the IRS and the Federal Reserve look like child's play, and a global implementation of smart grid technology that will be beta-tested in Africa,
[00:40:49.148 --> 00:40:51.270]  Under the $7 billion of U.S.
[00:40:51.330 --> 00:41:12.109]  taxpayer money Obama donated to the project titled Power Africa, the socialist tentacles of Agenda 2030 now reach right into our own backyards, as Obama, in a last-ditch effort, aims to essentially transform America by giving the poorest of neighborhoods an equitable stake in the richest of neighborhoods.
[00:41:12.449 --> 00:41:15.952]  The Austin, Texas City Council is hiring, not electing,
[00:41:16.192 --> 00:41:16.773]  We're good to go.
[00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:46.656]  We should consider the creation of an equity office, have chief equity officer or propose an alternative that provides such a dedicated office.
[00:41:46.876 --> 00:41:56.803]  Such an office could advance racial and ethnic equity by looking at all the city does with a focus on equity, gathering equity data and creating dashboards
[00:41:57.063 --> 00:42:00.645]  Advocating for and perhaps staffing the Quality of Life Commissions.
[00:42:00.826 --> 00:42:11.993]  The work would focus on tackling institutional barriers based on race and ethnicity and addressing those issues that interfere with access and equitable service delivery.
[00:42:12.173 --> 00:42:18.257]  In response, Austin City Council Member Ora Houston replied, Mayor, this is a great idea.
[00:42:18.437 --> 00:42:24.081]  Equity is an issue of class as well as ethnicity and or culture.
[00:42:24.301 --> 00:42:29.242]  So we are there building and drawing the maps and holding people accountable.
[00:42:29.322 --> 00:42:43.506]  I think equity means that we, I guess, denounce the sense of a system that was created for us and start looking at how do we build our own systems the way that works for the community that's screaming that we need equity.
[00:42:43.866 --> 00:42:49.307]  One of the things that we see as being really effective across the country is use of a racial equity tool.
[00:42:49.992 --> 00:42:56.537]  And what that means is that when decisions are being made, that we are considering race in the impacts.
[00:42:56.997 --> 00:43:02.982]  Whether the decision is actively perpetuating the status quo or working to change the status quo.
[00:43:03.102 --> 00:43:07.025]  The history of change in the United States is the history of organizing.
[00:43:07.805 --> 00:43:15.092]  And the reason why we have had change is because of community organizing, putting pressure on government.
[00:43:15.252 --> 00:43:26.063]  The main goal of the micromanagement of communities cloaked in the disguise of diversity is to eventually break communities down into sustainable megacities.
[00:43:26.343 --> 00:43:32.189]  A one-world system that will follow the implementation of the United Nations Strong Cities Network
[00:43:32.429 --> 00:43:46.931]  Replacing our local police forces, the watering down or complete elimination of the Second Amendment under the enforcement of Secretary of State John Kerry's signing of the Small Arms Treaty and an engineered global depression.
[00:43:47.272 --> 00:43:53.173]  United Nations manipulation of the human population has become a very stark reality.
[00:43:53.733 --> 00:43:58.914]  A reality you won't be hearing about from the mainstream media until it's too late.
[00:43:59.574 --> 00:44:01.494]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:44:04.516 --> 00:44:05.937]  I don't know.
[00:44:06.037 --> 00:44:07.457]  I'm waiting here.
[00:44:29.872 --> 00:44:30.653]  We're good to go.
[00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:00.711]  Look at that!
[00:45:00.731 --> 00:45:03.773]  There's a medic's bed over here.
[00:45:03.973 --> 00:45:05.255]  I don't know why.
[00:45:05.275 --> 00:45:07.817]  It's kind of interesting.
[00:45:08.237 --> 00:45:12.261]  There's Hillary's ambulance.
[00:45:12.281 --> 00:45:13.101]  No, there's her motorcade.
[00:45:13.241 --> 00:45:19.367]  Yeah, they brought Hillary's motorcade and in Hillary's motorcade they have an ambulance.
[00:45:32.028 --> 00:45:42.811]  Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[00:45:43.131 --> 00:45:45.352]  It's time to stop submitting to this tyranny!
[00:45:45.372 --> 00:45:47.633]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[00:45:48.253 --> 00:45:51.034]  Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works.
[00:45:52.554 --> 00:45:55.255]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[00:45:55.435 --> 00:45:59.016]  Tyranny with a capital T. You should reject these voices.
[00:45:59.797 --> 00:46:01.117]  Everything that's been done
[00:46:02.315 --> 00:46:18.831]  With torture, vendition, the NDAA, the Patriot Acts 1 and 2, from day one, was focused on the American people, period.
[00:46:20.232 --> 00:46:20.653]  That's it.
[00:46:21.801 --> 00:46:30.329]  It's always been about erasing the Bill of Rights and Constitution and rolling out NSA spying publicly, saying it's for Al Qaeda.
[00:46:30.749 --> 00:46:34.833]  Rolling out torture, saying it's for Al Qaeda, but it's really for the general public.
[00:46:35.193 --> 00:46:43.781]  Rolling out total control and the end of any underground free market systems in the name of fighting Al Qaeda, but really shutting down any type of free commerce.
[00:46:44.242 --> 00:46:46.204]  This is all about converting us
[00:46:46.744 --> 00:46:52.263]  From a free society to a tyranny with a capital T.

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.304 --> 00:48:53.186]  We're good to go.
[00:49:09.366 --> 00:49:39.306]  Just when you thought Hillary's health couldn't have any more angles, what with the demon throat lozenges, her incessant hacking, the stools that she needs to prop her up, and of course the concussion-induced recklessness that put the country's national security at risk, well, InfoWars reporter Millie Weaver was on the ground there at Hillary Clinton's rally in Cleveland, Ohio earlier this week, and she got a good glimpse of Hillary's motorcade, and of course that includes an ambulance.
[00:49:39.886 --> 00:49:41.308]  Millie Lever joins us now.
[00:49:41.408 --> 00:49:42.088]  Welcome Millie.
[00:49:42.188 --> 00:49:44.150]  So now you first reported on this story.
[00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:53.277]  You got the scoop and you were immediately attacked by Raw Story who says you can debunk this in 30 seconds because all presidential motorcades have an ambulance but
[00:49:54.377 --> 00:49:57.859]  You know, the obvious point here, Hillary Clinton isn't the president.
[00:49:58.399 --> 00:50:00.920]  Did you see an ambulance at Trump's rally today?
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:02.521]  Exactly.
[00:50:02.861 --> 00:50:08.984]  And yes, I actually went to Donald Trump's rally today and there was not an ambulance there.
[00:50:09.744 --> 00:50:12.345]  He did not have any ambulance in his motorcade.
[00:50:12.686 --> 00:50:20.409]  So any type of, you know, argument that it was just, you know, oh, Hillary is going to have that because it's standard procedure.
[00:50:20.469 --> 00:50:21.490]  Well, that's not true.
[00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:30.415]  Um, maybe the President of the United States is gonna have an ambulance in his motorcade, but Hillary is not the President of the United States.
[00:50:31.215 --> 00:50:38.099]  So it just goes to, you know, what, uh, the media spinning lies and misinformation to try to
[00:50:38.619 --> 00:50:40.640]  Get us off of that hot button that we're on.
[00:50:41.621 --> 00:50:42.281]  Well, exactly.
[00:50:43.062 --> 00:50:51.087]  Watson's got an article out today just how the Clinton campaign is really pushing for the media to blatantly cover up, lie, anything.
[00:50:51.127 --> 00:50:53.468]  They do not want to touch this Hillary's health.
[00:50:53.508 --> 00:50:56.951]  They think this could have the potential to derail her entire campaign.
[00:50:57.611 --> 00:51:10.785]  But now I want to get to what you tweeted back to Raw Story because you're like, look, I saw you guys and your hit piece on me and my reporting, but does every single presidential candidate have a gurney?
[00:51:11.225 --> 00:51:19.734]  Hillary Clinton has a literal deathbed on wheels being rolled up to her tent to just catch her in case she drops dead at any minute.
[00:51:20.586 --> 00:51:24.469]  Yeah, that's exactly what it was.
[00:51:24.609 --> 00:51:42.700]  It was pretty crazy because I'm standing there waiting for Hillary to, you know, come out of her tent and the event was already running over an hour behind, so I had a feeling that something was wrong, that maybe she was sick or having some type of an episode or something.
[00:51:43.121 --> 00:51:44.982]  And sure enough, I turn right around and
[00:51:45.462 --> 00:51:54.711]  And there is a gurney and there's, you know, these EMS workers, but they are wearing what looks like bulletproof vests.
[00:51:55.471 --> 00:51:58.014]  And, you know, I was like, is this for Hillary Clinton?
[00:51:58.554 --> 00:52:10.345]  And sure enough, it was the same EMS workers that my video camera guy actually caught, you know, those people, you know, the ambulance that was part of her motorcade.
[00:52:11.025 --> 00:52:24.356]  You know, those guys came out of there and it seemed like they tried to wheel around as to, you know, not look too obvious going directly out of her tent or into her tent, but they were staged right behind stage.
[00:52:25.096 --> 00:52:25.376]  Right.
[00:52:25.537 --> 00:52:33.503]  Waiting in the event that maybe, you know, she might have had something happen or maybe she fainted or fell or, you know, we don't know what could have happened.
[00:52:34.793 --> 00:52:35.394]  Come on, Millie.
[00:52:35.494 --> 00:52:40.401]  I'm sure that the reason why they had the gurney there was for all of Hillary Clinton's fainting fans.
[00:52:40.621 --> 00:52:50.755]  You know, President Obama famously had many women fainting in his audiences, so I'm sure they're expecting the same type of response with Her Majesty the Queen Demon Hillary Clinton.
[00:52:51.647 --> 00:52:52.709]  Exactly, right?
[00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:59.818]  And how she had that, like, diva tent all set up there with her and everything, you know, and everybody's waiting.
[00:52:59.858 --> 00:53:00.859]  When's she gonna come out?
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:06.126]  When's she... You know, she ran an hour behind and everybody was, like, sitting out there in the blazing heat.
[00:53:06.747 --> 00:53:10.432]  You know, I felt like, man, maybe I might need this gurney soon, you know?
[00:53:10.592 --> 00:53:16.039]  And then when she came out, she just sounded so unbelievably awful.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:19.884]  I was like, man, does she have pneumonia or something?
[00:53:19.984 --> 00:53:23.969]  I mean, it sounded really, really, she sounded so sick in person.
[00:53:24.009 --> 00:53:25.230]  Her voice sounded so weak.
[00:53:26.091 --> 00:53:37.468]  And I can see why they might have had that, you know, that gurney there for her because she seemed like she might have just walked out of the back of the ambulance onto the stage, you know?
[00:53:38.410 --> 00:53:39.772]  That's how sick she seemed.
[00:53:39.972 --> 00:53:40.753]  It was crazy.
[00:53:41.374 --> 00:53:48.640]  Yeah, and you were actually there periscoping that live in real time, so of course that forced the media to have to cover her coughing fit.
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:51.041]  They covered it as just a little frog in her throat.
[00:53:51.742 --> 00:54:05.953]  Also, then they were immediately reporting how high the pollen count was in the area, not expecting the fact that everyone's going to go on the internet and go to the allergen tracker, which shows you the pollen count was actually pretty low that day.
[00:54:05.973 --> 00:54:08.055]  But you know what, Millie, the tent there,
[00:54:08.735 --> 00:54:18.725]  Hillary Clinton already said in her, in the forum last night that she uses the tents to block off any Russian agents from hacking into her mobile devices.
[00:54:18.765 --> 00:54:24.931]  So that's why, that's, that's her, you know, just making sure she doesn't put the country's national security at risk there with the diva tent.
[00:54:25.391 --> 00:54:27.313]  So you were, you were at the Trump rally today.
[00:54:27.353 --> 00:54:27.894]  What happened?
[00:54:28.996 --> 00:54:32.438]  Well, it was a really great speak from Donald Trump.
[00:54:32.558 --> 00:54:34.779]  I mean, you know, his speech was amazing.
[00:54:34.919 --> 00:54:51.348]  He just was talking about how, you know, children and parents should have the right to choose schools for their children instead of kind of being locked into a certain neighborhood and how this can actually benefit, you know, people in
[00:54:52.328 --> 00:54:53.009]  Yeah, the forum.
[00:55:11.458 --> 00:55:18.486]  If any kind of debate it was, it was between, you know, Matt and Trump or Matt and Hillary, but... Right.
[00:55:19.207 --> 00:55:25.414]  So I saw that you were tweeting about the press putting words in Trump's mouth before he even came out on stage.
[00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:28.210]  Yes, that was interesting.
[00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:38.193]  You know, I couldn't believe how unprofessional some of these mainstream media crews were in the media staging area.
[00:55:38.213 --> 00:55:43.855]  I mean, I think it was CBS News, I'm pretty sure, but they had
[00:55:44.375 --> 00:55:55.923]  You know, they had their guy, the reporter, and he had his cell phone ringer on and it just was really loud and his phone started ringing in the middle of the, you know, Donald Trump's speech.
[00:55:56.003 --> 00:56:02.527]  But worst of all, he picked up his phone and answered his phone and started talking on the phone and people were like, are you serious?
[00:56:03.187 --> 00:56:05.849]  And then he's all like pushing the keys on his phone.
[00:56:05.929 --> 00:56:07.810]  You can hear the beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:16.896]  And they're, you know, they're arguing back and forth amongst each other on what, you know, what storylines, you know, they're going to go with and what they're going to say Trump said.
[00:56:16.956 --> 00:56:28.063]  And, you know, they're already deciding what the story is going to be and what he said, you know, the way to spin it before they even, you know, hear him say it or before anybody else.
[00:56:28.103 --> 00:56:30.705]  So it was just really crazy to see that unprofessional,
[00:56:33.308 --> 00:56:36.851]  Well, they're just right out the gate.
[00:56:37.732 --> 00:56:39.013]  It's there with the disrespect.
[00:56:39.233 --> 00:56:46.399]  Even Matt Lauer, immediately before he even started questioning Donald Trump, he said, no, keep the attacks to a minimum.
[00:56:46.479 --> 00:56:48.921]  So just kind of setting the stage for disrespect.
[00:56:49.601 --> 00:56:51.343]  I'm going to come and attack your integrity.
[00:56:51.803 --> 00:56:55.967]  So will we have some reports coming out from the Trump rally from you tonight, Millie Weaver?
[00:56:56.667 --> 00:56:58.528]  Yes, we definitely will.
[00:56:59.169 --> 00:57:04.172]  You're going to get to see Trump's motorcade and, you know, some of Trump's speech and everything like that.
[00:57:04.232 --> 00:57:06.413]  I mean, it's going to be pretty awesome.
[00:57:06.733 --> 00:57:14.598]  And I mean, like you said, I did think that that was a cheap shot for Matt Lauer to come out and say, hey, you know, you can't attack me.
[00:57:14.858 --> 00:57:23.624]  And he did exactly what he tried to say Trump was going to do so that, you know, he could try and act like Trump's being aggressive when he was the one being
[00:57:24.304 --> 00:57:26.605]  You know, overly badgering and aggressive toward Trump.
[00:57:26.745 --> 00:57:36.630]  So yeah, but definitely check out the video, guys, and that's going to be up probably as soon as possible, hopefully by tonight.
[00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:39.211]  And yeah, thanks very much, guys.
[00:57:39.991 --> 00:57:41.312]  Well, thank you so much, Millie Lever.
[00:57:41.332 --> 00:57:46.494]  You've been doing some awesome reporting from there on the ground, and we will have you back on the show really soon.
[00:57:46.714 --> 00:57:47.055]  Thank you.
[00:57:47.515 --> 00:57:47.795]  Thanks.
[00:57:53.831 --> 00:57:56.075]  All right, folks, that's going to do it for tonight's broadcast.
[00:57:56.095 --> 00:58:01.264]  The InfoWars Nightly News will return, Lord willing, tomorrow evening at 7 o'clock p.m.
[00:58:01.384 --> 00:58:01.825]  Central.
[00:58:02.166 --> 00:58:04.209]  Until then, have a blessed night.
[00:58:04.570 --> 00:58:06.594]  We'll see you right back here tomorrow.
[00:58:06.974 --> 00:58:07.175]  See ya!
[00:58:11.792 --> 00:58:21.354]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[00:58:21.814 --> 00:58:23.534]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:58:23.714 --> 00:58:24.275]  Think about it.
[00:58:24.475 --> 00:58:30.236]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[00:58:30.516 --> 00:58:36.117]  But on the other hand, the Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:58:36.477 --> 00:58:40.718]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources,
[00:58:41.238 --> 00:58:48.241]  Or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[00:58:48.501 --> 00:58:51.262]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[00:58:51.463 --> 00:58:53.924]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[00:58:54.244 --> 00:58:58.706]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[00:58:59.146 --> 00:58:59.726]  Think about it.
[00:58:59.926 --> 00:59:03.308]  This is Darren McBreen, and I want you to break the matrix.
[00:59:04.128 --> 00:59:09.933]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.394 --> 00:59:20.122]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.442 --> 00:59:24.185]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.746 --> 00:59:27.588]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:36.017]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.317 --> 00:59:38.620]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:39.261 --> 00:59:41.703]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:59:42.104 --> 00:59:47.610]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
