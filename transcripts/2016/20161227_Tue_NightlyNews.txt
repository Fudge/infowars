[00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:22.206]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.246 --> 00:00:26.348]  It is Tuesday, December 27th, 2016 and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.408 --> 00:00:27.368]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.897 --> 00:00:37.041]  We look at the newly minted Ministry of Truth, the so-called Global Engagement Center.
[00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:42.225]  It was just signed into law over the holidays by Obama with strong Republican support in Congress.
[00:00:42.486 --> 00:00:43.086]  How will it work?
[00:00:43.286 --> 00:00:43.847]  Who will run it?
[00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:45.948]  How will it violate the Constitution?
[00:00:46.108 --> 00:00:50.432]  And why it is not a response to the Russian dog ate my homework narrative.
[00:00:50.772 --> 00:01:00.063]  Then, how new consumer devices, especially those collectively known as the smart home, will erode your privacy, your freedom, and your security in the coming year.
[00:01:00.464 --> 00:01:07.232]  And, technology may take your job also, as the White House assesses the artificial intelligence impact on employment.
[00:01:07.612 --> 00:01:13.314]  They say AI will take between 10% to 1 half of all jobs in the next decade.
[00:01:13.514 --> 00:01:14.955]  But the White House says that's all good.
[00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:20.817]  Because multinational corporations will get more productive and even richer when they don't employ you.
[00:01:21.217 --> 00:01:23.978]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.327 --> 00:01:36.950]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.
[00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:44.714]  We're making freedom go viral, and now we are proud to announce a new weapon in the epic battle against the globalists.

[00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:29.510]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:05.626 --> 00:03:11.011]  Well, Obama was giving us a suggestion that there should be some sort of a truthiness filter.
[00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:16.775]  He sort of followed through on that this Christmas weekend while you and your family were preparing for the holidays.
[00:03:17.476 --> 00:03:23.021]  Obama was very busy signing the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act.
[00:03:23.581 --> 00:03:26.422]  This of course, you know, this happens every year right around Christmas.
[00:03:26.483 --> 00:03:30.204]  This is something authorizing $611 billion for the military in 2017.
[00:03:31.265 --> 00:03:33.106]  Nothing too unroutine there.
[00:03:33.966 --> 00:03:40.310]  But the biggest news is what was buried deep inside the provisions of the Defense Authorization Act.
[00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.251]  It was a bill to implement the U.S.'
[00:03:43.231 --> 00:03:46.233]  's very own de facto Ministry of Truth.
[00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:48.634]  This has been quietly introduced in Congress.
[00:03:48.674 --> 00:03:52.897]  We did a report on this in June and again last month.
[00:03:54.177 --> 00:03:59.640]  But this is legislation called the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act of 2016.
[00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:07.328]  Marks a further curtailment of press freedom and another avenue to stultify avenues of accurate information.
[00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:15.377]  So it was introduced as HR 5181 seeking a whole government approach without the bureaucratic restrictions.
[00:04:16.138 --> 00:04:22.603]  To counter foreign disinformation and manipulation, they believe this threatens the world's security and stability.
[00:04:22.663 --> 00:04:31.249]  Of course, you heard they were really blaming the election, the big upset there on the Russian and their propaganda and the fake news.
[00:04:31.929 --> 00:04:37.774]  And you think, wow, is this really just in retaliation for the fact that their establishment agent did not get elected?
[00:04:37.874 --> 00:04:40.776]  Well, now you can kind of get a little back story here.
[00:04:40.816 --> 00:04:42.657]  They've been planning this all along.
[00:04:42.697 --> 00:04:44.578]  And of course, we know that this is how tyranny
[00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:53.501]  First comes about with controlling your speech and the way that you're allowed to think and the information that you're allowed to access.
[00:04:53.521 --> 00:04:56.962]  So this is also called the Countering Information Warfare Act of 2016.
[00:04:57.543 --> 00:05:08.646]  So they keep entering these acts into Congress and then they rename them and now it's foreign propaganda when earlier it was just information warfare.
[00:05:10.023 --> 00:05:11.104]  And so H.R.
[00:05:11.524 --> 00:05:24.713]  5181 tasks the Secretary of State with coordinating the Secretary of Defense, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Broadcasting Board of Governors to establish a Center for Information Analysis and Response.
[00:05:25.154 --> 00:05:34.901]  So they're going to pinpoint sources of disinformation, analyze the data, and develop and disseminate fact-based narratives to counter any propaganda.
[00:05:35.541 --> 00:05:38.983]  So they're basically saying, you know, we're going to be putting out our news.
[00:05:39.043 --> 00:05:41.564]  It's going to be all fact-based and you should just trust us.
[00:05:42.565 --> 00:05:48.388]  But they're saying that they must do this now to counter the propaganda that has somehow penetrated U.S.
[00:05:48.528 --> 00:05:48.888]  shores.
[00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:53.811]  So this is, of course, long before the whole fake news narrative took hold.
[00:05:54.731 --> 00:05:55.151]  The U.S.
[00:05:55.191 --> 00:05:59.414]  government was already planning its legally backed crackdown on anything it would eventually label
[00:06:00.054 --> 00:06:00.694]  Fake news.
[00:06:00.794 --> 00:06:06.317]  So they have really been prepping this fake news meme and they want everyone to kind of get along with, go along with this.
[00:06:06.337 --> 00:06:12.280]  You know, Obama said we really need to just go back to those days when we really had only three news programs that were giving people info.
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.421]  It was easier then.
[00:06:13.441 --> 00:06:16.182]  It was easier before people had so many choices.
[00:06:16.862 --> 00:06:21.825]  And, you know, before the establishment mouthpiece were able to just tell you what to think and how to feel.
[00:06:22.745 --> 00:06:28.931]  So, now December 8th, of course, we reported earlier this month about the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act.
[00:06:28.991 --> 00:06:35.376]  It passed the Senate and now it had been quietly inserted into the 2017 NDAA.
[00:06:36.117 --> 00:06:37.078]  So, there you go.
[00:06:37.138 --> 00:06:42.403]  Now, David Knight and Owen Shroyer are going to be joining us in studio in the next segment to kind of break this down.
[00:06:42.423 --> 00:06:46.326]  They're going to name names and really get into the nitty-gritty of just what this means for you.
[00:06:47.367 --> 00:07:01.153]  But here's something hilarious that I don't think that the mainstream media, the establishment media really was counting on when they were pushing out this whole fake news narrative and trying to sully the reputation of InfoWars and Breitbart and others.
[00:07:02.754 --> 00:07:09.817]  The people totally turned fake news against the mainstream media and said you guys are the number one perpetrators of fake news.
[00:07:09.837 --> 00:07:10.457]  Are you kidding me?
[00:07:10.857 --> 00:07:12.458]  And of course in the New York Times they were
[00:07:13.393 --> 00:07:19.176]  Fuming after conservative media appropriated fake news, turned it against them.
[00:07:19.576 --> 00:07:25.779]  This was New York Times' Jeremy Peters, not happy about the conservatives taking aim at the mainstream media.
[00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:41.386]  He says, the CIA, the FBI, and the White House may all agree that Russia was behind the hacking that interfered with the election, but that was of no import to the website Breitbart News, which dismissed reports on the intelligence assessment as left-wing fake news.
[00:07:42.816 --> 00:07:46.018]  And of course went on to say Rush Limbaugh said the fake news is the everyday news.
[00:07:46.058 --> 00:07:46.978]  They just make it up.
[00:07:47.058 --> 00:07:54.602]  And a man was actually heckling reporters who are walking out of a Trump rally in Orlando, calling them fake news, fake news.
[00:07:55.083 --> 00:08:06.149]  So he's very incredulous about the fact that this fake news meme that they've tried to put out there has totally been appropriated, much like the whole deplorable basket of deplorables with Hillary Clinton.
[00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:07.990]  People just really took that on and owned it.
[00:08:09.212 --> 00:08:10.113]  And that's exactly it.
[00:08:10.213 --> 00:08:11.754]  They are the real fake news.
[00:08:12.394 --> 00:08:22.382]  And they're saying that, it's just, oh, when I read this it makes my head explode because there's so much doublespeak in the way that these totalitarians speak and the way they talk.
[00:08:22.422 --> 00:08:28.467]  They truly believe that they're the nice guys and they're not doing all of this, you know, pushing this heavy agenda.
[00:08:29.387 --> 00:08:37.473]  But he goes on to say that they've appropriated the term fake news and turned it against any news that they see as hostile to their agenda.
[00:08:38.374 --> 00:08:41.397]  That's exactly what the real fake news is doing.
[00:08:41.437 --> 00:08:45.541]  They're saying that they've got to put a truthiness filter on everything and filter out the fake news.
[00:08:45.961 --> 00:08:53.268]  It's anything that is going to counter their establishment agents that they're trying to prop up, just like Hillary Clinton totally failed.
[00:08:53.689 --> 00:08:57.712]  And they said, man, we've got to do away with the people's ability to access information.
[00:08:58.533 --> 00:09:09.240]  And now going on to talk a little bit more about Obama's legacy as he's in the last hours of his presidency trying to push through these secret bills, tyrannical bills.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.963]  Mind you, the Republicans want this too, so this is not just a left versus right thing.
[00:09:13.983 --> 00:09:16.525]  They all want this, so everyone needs to pay attention to that.
[00:09:16.565 --> 00:09:18.126]  They'll get to that in the next segment coming up.
[00:09:18.686 --> 00:09:27.794]  But Newt Gingrich is actually coming out saying that President Obama's final series of policy initiatives is part of a desperate frenzy to leave a legacy.
[00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:33.859]  Basically everything he's done here is going to be quickly overturned by Donald Trump.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:41.548]  Um, because everything he's, most of his policies were implemented by executive action rather than with bipartisan legislation.
[00:09:41.968 --> 00:09:45.091]  So it's going to be very easy for President Trump to overturn everything he's done.
[00:09:45.592 --> 00:09:51.338]  But in the past week alone, the Obama administration has blocked future oil and gas leases offshore.
[00:09:52.179 --> 00:10:03.189]  In parts of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, they've cancelled a once-mandatory registry focused on immigrant men from Muslim countries, and they're moving to transfer detainees out of Guantanamo Bay.
[00:10:03.589 --> 00:10:15.740]  So of course, all this is going to do is heighten divisions in this country, and it's going to highlight the fact that when the Republicans overturn everything, and the Trump administration overturns all the good stuff Obama did in his last week there,
[00:10:16.801 --> 00:10:19.144]  They can then say, see how bad the Republicans are.
[00:10:19.184 --> 00:10:20.706]  They want to create this registry.
[00:10:20.726 --> 00:10:29.618]  I mean, this is all just a part of the plan to delegitimize Donald Trump, keep Donald Trump busy with overturning this stuff, and polarize the nation.
[00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:31.200]  Continue to polarize the nation.
[00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:35.483]  So on, you know, Obama's legacy, jobs, that's a joke.
[00:10:35.883 --> 00:10:40.505]  One of their parting statements was a report released Wednesday.
[00:10:41.026 --> 00:10:48.529]  It's called the Artificial Intelligence Automation and the Economy Report, basically saying robots may take half of all jobs in the U.S.
[00:10:48.609 --> 00:10:50.090]  and you should just embrace it.
[00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:51.831]  Everyone's going to be out of a job soon.
[00:10:51.871 --> 00:10:52.752]  Just embrace it.
[00:10:52.872 --> 00:10:54.194]  It's for innovation.
[00:10:54.554 --> 00:10:57.437]  They're talking about, you know, we have to invest and develop AI.
[00:10:57.457 --> 00:10:59.078]  It has many benefits.
[00:10:59.398 --> 00:11:02.001]  We've got to educate and train Americans for the jobs of the future.
[00:11:02.021 --> 00:11:04.363]  You know, aid workers for this transition.
[00:11:04.383 --> 00:11:12.550]  Oh, but they acknowledge there are countless unknowns from what the effects could be to how quickly they'll arrive.
[00:11:12.931 --> 00:11:14.052]  Of course, when I spoke to
[00:11:15.453 --> 00:11:25.701]  The writer of Artificial Intelligence, the author of Artificial Intelligence, he kind of scoffed at this whole 2030, 2040 idea that the jobs would be automated.
[00:11:25.741 --> 00:11:27.122]  He said it's going to be here by 2020.
[00:11:28.463 --> 00:11:29.984]  So that's just a few years away.
[00:11:30.044 --> 00:11:31.665]  Donald Trump's going to have to be dealing with this.
[00:11:32.045 --> 00:11:35.908]  But they say jobs over the next decade can range 9% to 47% being completely wiped out.
[00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:39.771]  So there you go, there's that.
[00:11:40.072 --> 00:11:52.363]  And then of course we have the refugees admissions surging 86% year-on-year as Obama is rushing through arrivals of refugees ahead of the Trump inauguration.
[00:11:52.904 --> 00:11:54.385]  So in the first 84 days of the 2017 fiscal year,
[00:11:57.228 --> 00:12:02.973]  The Obama administration accepted more than 25,000 refugees into the United States.
[00:12:03.373 --> 00:12:09.178]  That represents an 86% increase from that same period in fiscal year 2016.
[00:12:09.799 --> 00:12:17.785]  So nothing like completely ignoring the will of the American people to pursue your own agenda, which is exactly what we see happening in Europe.
[00:12:19.547 --> 00:12:23.710]  There's a report coming out from Europe's Border and Coast Guard Agency
[00:12:24.531 --> 00:12:29.295]  Which is a total like, duh, we tried to tell you all this, but they have this report coming out now.
[00:12:29.675 --> 00:12:40.463]  Finally admitting that their intelligence indicates coordinated efforts on the part of ISIS to recruit asylum seekers both in Syria and in migrant camps after they've already reached Europe.
[00:12:40.523 --> 00:12:43.225]  They're targeting them to carry out these terrorist attacks.
[00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:53.191]  They say Syrian refugee diaspora may become vulnerable to radicalization once in Europe and may be specifically targeted by Islamic extremist recruiters.
[00:12:53.652 --> 00:13:03.518]  And the report goes on to note that German authorities were aware of around 300 recorded attempts made by jihadists to recruit refugees as of April 2016.
[00:13:04.519 --> 00:13:12.524]  This is all while Angela Merkel has continued to relentlessly push this open border policy, much like President Obama when Trump was
[00:13:13.385 --> 00:13:18.826]  Thrown to the fire for saying, well, you know, maybe we should just stop taking refugees until we can actually vet these people.
[00:13:19.567 --> 00:13:20.807]  Same deal with Angela Merkel.
[00:13:21.707 --> 00:13:26.248]  Obama, of course, is not going to be running again, but I don't think Merkel's going to be getting reelected.
[00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:30.969]  And now, of course, on with the president's legacy.
[00:13:31.049 --> 00:13:37.071]  Donald Trump was also chastised for saying that Obama and Hillary were the founders of ISIS.
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:43.922]  And of course now Turkey's President Erdogan is claiming that he has confirmed evidence that the U.S.
[00:13:43.942 --> 00:13:46.383]  has actually helped support ISIS.
[00:13:46.483 --> 00:13:51.744]  They claim the coalition has supported terror groups including ISIS and Kurdish militant groups.
[00:13:51.764 --> 00:13:55.265]  They say they have pictures, photo and video proof of this.
[00:13:55.285 --> 00:13:55.325]  So...
[00:13:57.626 --> 00:13:58.307]  Here you go.
[00:13:58.507 --> 00:14:08.978]  Basically that is President Obama's legacy is leaving everything in absolute disarray with a smile and he is gonna do it all and still make his tea time.
[00:14:12.361 --> 00:14:29.697]  Anas Amri, the jihadist that drove a truck into scores of people in Berlin, leaving 12 dead and injuring dozens, finally faced justice in Milan, Italy as a rookie police officer, took Amri down in a hail of bullets after Amri pulled a gun while being asked for identification.
[00:14:29.877 --> 00:14:35.062]  Amri had been one of the many refugees leaving Tunisia during the Arab Spring in 2011 for European chores.
[00:14:36.243 --> 00:14:42.328]  Tunisia now seen as a jihadist hotbed, sending more fighters to Syria than any other country.
[00:14:42.489 --> 00:14:54.780]  Omri had been allowed to remain in Europe regardless of the fact that he had spent four years in prison after being held responsible for burning down a migrant reception center on the Italian island of Lampedusa.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:01.566]  Back in Germany, Angela Merkel continued to ignore the blood on her hands as calls for her to step down echoed.
[00:15:01.906 --> 00:15:06.410]  Throughout Berlin's Washington Square, numbering as high as 10,000 protesters.
[00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:10.473]  Because right now, we still don't know exactly what happened.
[00:15:13.206 --> 00:15:15.607]  We have to presume this is a terrorist attack.
[00:15:16.208 --> 00:15:26.155]  Three suspected jihadists said to be linked to Anis Amri have been arrested in Tunisia, the home country of the supposed Berlin truck attacker.
[00:15:26.655 --> 00:15:36.722]  Described as members of a terrorist cell by Tunisia's interior ministry, the trio includes a nephew of Amri who was shot dead by Italian police in Milan on Friday.
[00:15:37.183 --> 00:15:38.203]  It will be very hard
[00:15:39.404 --> 00:15:41.267]  To deal with this, to understand this.
[00:15:42.249 --> 00:15:44.672]  If we find out that this was committed by someone...
[00:15:45.723 --> 00:15:48.204]  Who took refuge in Germany.
[00:15:49.064 --> 00:15:54.525]  And now the world enters the Christmas season on high alert as ISIS releases a list of U.S.
[00:15:54.605 --> 00:15:55.745]  churches to attack.
[00:15:56.045 --> 00:15:57.966]  Record highs surge across the U.S.
[00:15:58.026 --> 00:16:10.089]  border, numbering on the average of 1,574 per day and 820,000 illegal immigrants with felonies and serious misdemeanors walk the streets of the United States.
[00:16:10.409 --> 00:16:15.130]  Urged on by the reckless support of President Obama and the Mexican ambassador,
[00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:17.731]  We are facing a crisis of epic proportions.
[00:16:19.192 --> 00:16:24.855]  More than 65 million people have been driven from their homes, which is more than any time since the Second World War.
[00:16:26.595 --> 00:16:30.977]  Among them are more than 21 million refugees who have fled their countries.
[00:16:32.538 --> 00:16:42.303]  Everything and everyone they've ever known, playing with a suitcase or the clothes on their back, is a crisis of our shared security.
[00:16:43.649 --> 00:16:45.791]  Not because refugees are a threat.
[00:16:46.191 --> 00:16:51.596]  Refugees, most of whom are women and children, are often fleeing war and terrorism.
[00:16:51.977 --> 00:16:52.717]  They are victims.
[00:16:54.459 --> 00:17:00.584]  They're families who want to be safe and to work, be good citizens and contribute to their country.
[00:17:01.465 --> 00:17:07.711]  If we were to turn refugees away simply because of their background or religion, or for example because they are Muslim,
[00:17:08.834 --> 00:17:15.738]  Then we would be reinforcing terrorist propaganda that nations like my own are somehow opposed to Islam.
[00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:22.983]  It is an ugly lie that must be rejected in all of our countries by upholding the values of pluralism and diversity.
[00:17:23.303 --> 00:17:27.105]  So, I'm wondering how this might affect relationships?
[00:17:27.125 --> 00:17:28.446]  It's an attack on humanity.
[00:17:28.586 --> 00:17:29.206]  That's what it is.
[00:17:29.346 --> 00:17:32.068]  It's an attack on humanity.
[00:17:32.248 --> 00:17:33.389]  And it's got to be stopped.
[00:17:34.306 --> 00:17:39.688]  If you take a trip along the San Diego-Mexico border, on the surface you won't notice anything different.
[00:17:40.088 --> 00:17:40.868]  But there is.
[00:17:41.308 --> 00:17:43.529]  It's the changing face of immigration.
[00:17:43.889 --> 00:17:47.110]  Right now we're seeing a large influx of Syrian refugees seeking asylum.
[00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:52.792]  Crime will surge, disease will spread, and more terror attacks are inevitable.
[00:17:53.012 --> 00:17:57.316]  Unfortunately, Obama's days as President are coming to a close.
[00:17:57.536 --> 00:18:04.884]  The lifting of Obama's fog of apocalyptic immigration will be finally recognized for what it is.
[00:18:05.224 --> 00:18:14.493]  And anyone with any sense in their head will come to the conclusion that this is why we have immigration laws that need to be enforced.
[00:18:14.934 --> 00:18:16.876]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:18:18.066 --> 00:18:24.288]  Well, coming up, David Knight and Owen Schroyer will be breaking down this countering foreign propaganda and disinformation act of 2016.
[00:18:24.368 --> 00:18:28.089]  We're going to get to the details and how it will directly affect you.
[00:18:28.629 --> 00:18:30.449]  Margaret Howell will be joining me in studio.
[00:18:30.469 --> 00:18:35.350]  We're going to talk about the fact that universities are now just eliminating American history altogether.
[00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:36.451]  Who needs it?
[00:18:37.031 --> 00:18:43.332]  And of course, we're going to have a little update on that Drexel University professor who wished for white genocide.
[00:18:43.492 --> 00:18:45.613]  All of that is coming up right after this.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:16.390]  Three years ago, the Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act repealed the law that had been on the books for decades, barring the CIA and other agencies from engaging in domestic propaganda and disinformation.
[00:19:17.734 --> 00:19:36.355]  Over the weekend, they passed the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act that funds 160 plus million dollars to this new organization that will, quote, discover and counter with its own disinformation, alternative media that they dub fake news.
[00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:52.010]  At the very same time, we see mainstream media claiming that Trump, myself, Tucker Carlson, you name it, are Russian agents, and that the American people really wanted Hillary Clinton, but the Russians somehow hacked in, and that's why Trump won.
[00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:56.173]  Yes, we've gotten Trump elected, but they're openly trying to overthrow that.
[00:19:57.034 --> 00:20:00.379]  Now more than ever, InfoWars needs your prayers and your support.
[00:20:00.439 --> 00:20:06.106]  And I need you to take the articles and the videos that are on the site and realize you're the reason we're having such an effect.

[00:20:13.849 --> 00:20:22.471]  As we approach Christmas, and I'm supposed to say that word now, our country's under such incredible thought police tyranny, it's important to be thankful.
[00:20:22.612 --> 00:20:34.215]  And I am extremely thankful to all of you that have prayed for us, that have spread the word about the broadcast, that have supported us, that have defended us, and that have financially supported us.

[00:23:05.151 --> 00:23:12.237]  Well, it was a Merry Christmas indeed, and Santa Obama slipped a little gift under the tree for us this year.
[00:23:12.638 --> 00:23:15.680]  It is the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.
[00:23:17.242 --> 00:23:19.884]  I'm joined in studio now by David Knight to talk about this.
[00:23:20.264 --> 00:23:24.248]  David, what worries you the most about this little gift left from Barack Obama?
[00:23:24.648 --> 00:23:27.411]  Well, what worries me the most, Owen, is that it isn't just Obama.
[00:23:27.491 --> 00:23:30.193]  This is something that the GOP has pushed very heavily for.
[00:23:30.234 --> 00:23:35.959]  This is something that has been developing for a number of years, going back to 2012, the NDAA Act then.
[00:23:36.419 --> 00:23:39.803]  Of course, the thing that was in everybody's attention at that point in time
[00:23:40.223 --> 00:23:40.564]  We're good.
[00:24:01.604 --> 00:24:11.408]  They put into the NDAA something that would effectively nullify the Smith-Munt Act of 1948, which they put in as a prohibition against propagandizing Americans.
[00:24:11.448 --> 00:24:17.291]  So, in 2012, they stopped the prohibition of government being involved in propaganda.
[00:24:17.791 --> 00:24:27.773]  And we said at the time, InfoWars said CIA will now openly propagandize Americans, and now here we are four years later, they have set up a structure to actively do that.
[00:24:27.853 --> 00:24:38.256]  So first four years ago they removed the ban, now they have gone proactive and said this is how we're going to do it, and they've funded it to the tune of 160 million dollars for two years.
[00:24:39.159 --> 00:24:48.307]  And what they actually did here was very sneaky, not just bringing it in on Christmas Eve, I guess, you know, Barack Obama wanted to play Santa this year, but the original bill was H.R.
[00:24:48.327 --> 00:25:07.203]  5181, a lot of people brought attention to this, but instead of actually passing that bill, what they did was they inserted it, essentially the same thing, or the same goals, into the NDAA for fiscal year 2017, specifically Section 1287, the Global Engagement Center.
[00:25:07.623 --> 00:25:12.125]  Now, there's all kinds of nuts and bolts we want to get into there, but real quick, just to go back to the H.R.
[00:25:13.126 --> 00:25:12.125]  5181.
[00:25:13.846 --> 00:25:20.189]  Now, what they did here was they had to change the name of this bill to Countering Foreign Propaganda Act.
[00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:22.090]  That's not the original name of this bill.
[00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:30.755]  That was a recent title change, and then you go and you look at the actual text, it mentions foreign governments, including the government of Russia,
[00:25:31.255 --> 00:25:36.758]  Using disinformation and other propaganda tools to undermine the national security objectives of the United States.
[00:25:37.138 --> 00:25:40.440]  David, this seems like something that has been long in the works here.
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:47.144]  Yeah, as we pointed out earlier, and you and I were on the radio show talking about this, there's been 100 years of propaganda from the American government.
[00:25:47.324 --> 00:25:49.965]  It was the American government that invented propaganda.
[00:25:49.985 --> 00:25:50.866]  It wasn't Goebbels.
[00:25:51.346 --> 00:26:00.928]  We had a good 20 years on them thanks to Edward Bernays and Woodrow Wilson, somebody that I think Obama resembles more than any other president because he's going to remain in Washington just like Woodrow Wilson did.
[00:26:00.948 --> 00:26:03.368]  He's a committed globalist just like Woodrow Wilson.
[00:26:03.889 --> 00:26:06.949]  But this is something that was developed in the United States.
[00:26:07.009 --> 00:26:16.611]  And as we talked about when we did that countering the Infowars Act, because that's the way it started out, countering information warfare, then they changed it to countering foreign.
[00:26:16.631 --> 00:26:20.952]  They've got to get that foreign in there, Owen, because that's the enemy that we've got to be protected from.
[00:26:21.292 --> 00:26:24.094]  And then talking about propaganda because nobody likes propaganda.
[00:26:24.394 --> 00:26:35.239]  But let's remember how the American government created this, and I find this whole thing about creating a global center under the direction of the State Department, I mean, that is absolutely Orwellian.
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:36.340]  Absolutely Orwellian.
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.161]  And let's look at some of the text here.
[00:26:38.201 --> 00:26:39.562]  Let's disseminate some of this text.
[00:26:39.602 --> 00:26:45.027]  Now, we're going into Section 1287, the Global Engagement Center of the NDAA Act that Obama just passed.
[00:26:46.067 --> 00:26:46.748]  A.2.
[00:26:47.148 --> 00:27:01.099]  The purpose of the Center shall be to lead, synchronize, and coordinate efforts of the federal government to recognize, understand, expose, and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at undermining the United States' national security interests.
[00:27:01.339 --> 00:27:04.922]  They completely ignore the DNC, completely ignore Hillary Clinton's private server,
[00:27:05.362 --> 00:27:10.026]  But the main word that sticks out to me, David, is non-state propaganda.
[00:27:10.346 --> 00:27:14.429]  Are they basically opening the doors to put out their own propaganda?
[00:27:14.449 --> 00:27:16.831]  They're admitting they want state propaganda to run it.
[00:27:17.131 --> 00:27:17.731]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:27:17.751 --> 00:27:23.996]  Oh, and if you look at it, what they're going to fund is they're going to fund private institutions to do this as well.
[00:27:24.036 --> 00:27:29.540]  Just like we've seen non-governmental organizations use for sources color revolutions used by the State Department abroad.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:33.563]  These are the people who have created revolution throughout the world.
[00:27:33.643 --> 00:27:35.884]  These are people who have created regime change.
[00:27:35.944 --> 00:27:37.445]  We've seen how that's worked out in Libya.
[00:27:37.685 --> 00:27:39.286]  We've seen how that's worked out in Syria.
[00:27:39.326 --> 00:27:41.567]  We see what's happening in the former Soviet Union.
[00:27:41.827 --> 00:27:47.269]  They say this legislation will establish a fund to help train local journalists, provide grants and contracts to NGOs.
[00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:50.791]  These are the type of people that Soros has used in his color revolutions.
[00:27:51.211 --> 00:27:57.274]  Civil society organizations, think tanks, private sector companies, media organizations, other experts outside the U.S.
[00:27:57.314 --> 00:27:57.574]  government.
[00:27:57.634 --> 00:28:01.435]  In other words, anybody that will push forward their propaganda war.
[00:28:01.555 --> 00:28:02.416]  And we have to remember
[00:28:02.876 --> 00:28:09.565]  That it was about six years ago that Cass Sunstein, and we talked about this earlier, was talking about the necessity to nudge us.
[00:28:10.165 --> 00:28:12.068]  Yeah, they didn't want to come at us directly.
[00:28:12.168 --> 00:28:20.558]  Instead they wanted to develop a choice architecture where they could manipulate our choices by the information that they gave us.
[00:28:20.598 --> 00:28:21.920]  That is called propaganda.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:33.062]  That's something that has been perfected by American advertising, thanks to Edward Bernays and others, and that is something that the American government prohibited previously, prior to the 2012 NDAA Act.
[00:28:33.102 --> 00:28:34.823]  They removed, again, removed that prohibition.
[00:28:35.203 --> 00:28:37.303]  Now they have set up a structure to do this.
[00:28:37.683 --> 00:28:44.085]  I find it very concerning that this is being run by the State Department, one of the most anti-American, one of the
[00:28:44.925 --> 00:28:50.573]  The organizations that has run revolutions throughout the world, now they're bringing that revolution home.
[00:28:50.673 --> 00:28:59.585]  And as we heard from the founding fathers, they said the means of fighting tyranny abroad will be, of fighting wars abroad, will be brought back as tyranny at home.
[00:28:59.645 --> 00:29:01.127]  And that's what is happening with us.
[00:29:01.187 --> 00:29:02.289]  It's the weaponization of this.
[00:29:02.489 --> 00:29:15.720]  Well, and I'm glad you mentioned some of the funding that's going to go out to implement this bill, but they use words like grant and foreign propaganda to basically justify having state-run media.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.721]  I think that's the end goal here, David.
[00:29:17.981 --> 00:29:18.362]  Absolutely.
[00:29:20.123 --> 00:29:20.704]  We're good to go.
[00:29:38.883 --> 00:29:40.685]  It's Information Operations, I.O.
[00:29:40.705 --> 00:29:44.029]  It states that after a desert storm, he said the military wanted to transform I.O.
[00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:50.077]  into a core military competency on par with air, ground, maritime, and special operations.
[00:29:50.337 --> 00:29:51.959]  And he talks about the various components of it.
[00:29:52.019 --> 00:29:54.442]  Electronic warfare, computer network operations,
[00:29:54.722 --> 00:29:55.242]  We're good to go.
[00:30:13.172 --> 00:30:13.952]  Propaganda.
[00:30:14.052 --> 00:30:15.813]  That's what's fundamentally involved here.
[00:30:15.873 --> 00:30:25.415]  That's why they're combining the State Department that's experienced at overthrowing governments along with the military and along with the Director of National Intelligence.
[00:30:25.515 --> 00:30:26.615]  That's what they're combining here.
[00:30:26.635 --> 00:30:30.316]  The CIA, the State Department and the military to weaponize information.
[00:30:30.616 --> 00:30:32.477]  A literal war on Americans.
[00:30:32.697 --> 00:30:33.517]  And here's the proof.
[00:30:34.177 --> 00:30:41.804]  In this section, B10, it reads, they want to maintain, collect, use, and disseminate records.
[00:30:42.184 --> 00:30:49.110]  Such research and data analysis shall be reasonably tailored to meet the purposes of this paragraph.
[00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:50.451]  They are admitting it!
[00:30:50.991 --> 00:30:58.356]  In this bill, they want to cater and tailor the information that you get that suits their agenda.
[00:30:58.597 --> 00:31:16.389]  And then going on, B4, identify current and emerging trends in foreign propaganda, there's that word again, and disinformation in order to coordinate procedures to expose and refute foreign misinformation and disinformation, again ignoring state or domestic misinformation and disinformation, to
[00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:21.432]  Proactively promote fact-based narratives and policies to audiences outside the United States.
[00:31:21.612 --> 00:31:25.854]  This really is the most Orwellian bill I've ever seen, and you were mentioning this on the radio show.
[00:31:26.434 --> 00:31:29.916]  This is what InfoWars has been doing for 20 years.
[00:31:30.236 --> 00:31:35.098]  Disseminating the propaganda, trying to cipher through all of it to find the reality and the truth.
[00:31:35.458 --> 00:31:38.199]  They want to take over that power and they want to be controlled.
[00:31:38.459 --> 00:31:42.661]  They want to be the 1984 Orwellian state in charge of all information, David.
[00:31:42.681 --> 00:31:44.042]  Yeah, we've been dissecting it.
[00:31:44.082 --> 00:31:46.403]  They've been the ones disseminating it, but we have to understand
[00:31:47.183 --> 00:31:57.447]  How this is going to play out, Owen, we know that the government is going to be involved in setting up a new narrative, encountering other information, and think about how that contradicts with the First Amendment.
[00:31:57.467 --> 00:32:02.389]  The First Amendment says, Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech or of the press.
[00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:06.431]  The whole purpose of this is to abridge freedom of the press.
[00:32:06.831 --> 00:32:09.432]  It is to tell you what they want you to think.
[00:32:09.472 --> 00:32:15.255]  It is to control your information, take away your freedom of choice in terms of being able to choose what you want to hear,
[00:32:15.775 --> 00:32:22.579]  And giving you the narrative that they have carefully constructed to create a quote-unquote choice architecture.
[00:32:22.619 --> 00:32:25.460]  That's not my term, that's Cass Sunstein's terms.
[00:32:25.781 --> 00:32:31.584]  And of course, engineering consent is the term that Bernays used going back a hundred years.
[00:32:31.804 --> 00:32:38.347]  That's the purpose of all this, is to engineer consent to abridge freedom of press and freedom of speech.
[00:32:38.407 --> 00:32:39.368]  That's what this is all about.
[00:32:39.608 --> 00:32:46.071]  And to me, this document opens the doors for them to do all of that and then justify it.
[00:32:46.372 --> 00:32:47.152]  In fact, you know what?
[00:32:48.093 --> 00:32:49.994]  This is propaganda, okay?
[00:32:50.274 --> 00:32:51.975]  This bill is propaganda.
[00:32:51.995 --> 00:32:56.137]  This bill is what this bill is meant to stop, but that's why we at InfoWars are here to stop it.
[00:33:02.486 --> 00:33:07.268]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[00:33:07.429 --> 00:33:09.490]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down.
[00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:10.810]  I quit working out.
[00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:14.472]  I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[00:33:14.732 --> 00:33:19.035]  I started to exercise really hard again, and I started to try to eat healthy.
[00:33:19.075 --> 00:33:21.016]  I started taking third-party supplements.
[00:33:21.376 --> 00:33:23.217]  I started seeing some more gains.
[00:33:23.797 --> 00:33:24.017]  I think?
[00:33:42.092 --> 00:33:45.435]  I was in the best shape of my life since I've been in really good shape in my 20s.
[00:33:45.475 --> 00:33:46.536]  But the election heated up.
[00:33:46.576 --> 00:33:48.959]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[00:33:49.079 --> 00:33:58.348]  But more importantly, I stopped taking the supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[00:33:58.568 --> 00:33:59.509]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[00:33:59.689 --> 00:34:03.372]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put the Lazy Susan back on the table.
[00:34:04.173 --> 00:34:10.238]  And I'm going to start taking it religiously again, and I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[00:34:10.278 --> 00:34:11.579]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:15.283]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[00:34:15.483 --> 00:34:16.404]  It's December 5th, 2016.
[00:34:16.524 --> 00:34:20.367]  We're only like 25 days from 2017.
[00:34:20.487 --> 00:34:30.556]  And I want to invite all of the InfoWarriors of every race, color, and creed that bleed red blood and love liberty, justice, and truth to make our bodies great again.
[00:34:33.584 --> 00:34:38.567]  One of the most common questions I get is, you've changed the whole radio TV model.
[00:34:39.348 --> 00:34:40.088]  How did you do it?
[00:34:40.148 --> 00:34:43.030]  Did an ad agency teach you that or what book did you read?
[00:34:43.351 --> 00:34:44.912]  And the answer is, it was trial and error.
[00:34:45.172 --> 00:34:50.475]  I promote products that I personally use, like the Nutraceuticals and Infowarslife.com.
[00:34:50.956 --> 00:34:52.777]  And it's the same thing for this promotion.
[00:34:53.277 --> 00:34:54.598]  I didn't get this from an ad agency.
[00:34:54.658 --> 00:34:55.839]  I didn't just think this up.
[00:34:56.339 --> 00:35:03.184]  I was sitting there, I'd gained probably 10, 15 pounds because I'd gotten out of the habit of taking the supplements in the last few months with the election.
[00:35:03.964 --> 00:35:14.030]  And I was thinking, wow, I need to religiously take these, because I'm promoting these things, it's making me healthier, and if I'm not taking them, you know, I'm fatter, plus people aren't going to buy the product.
[00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:17.672]  So that's where the promotion comes from, is purely from reality.
[00:35:18.012 --> 00:35:24.816]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table, I'm religiously taking the products, and in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[00:35:25.176 --> 00:35:31.640]  I've lost five pounds, religiously taking just, what, four or five of the products.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:32.581]  It's amazing.
[00:35:32.861 --> 00:35:35.245]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[00:35:35.505 --> 00:35:38.229]  Go read the five star reviews for yourself.
[00:35:38.429 --> 00:35:40.992]  And to be clear, I'm exercising the same amount.
[00:35:41.693 --> 00:35:45.599]  It's the holidays, so I'm eating pumpkin pie, pecan pie.
[00:35:45.799 --> 00:35:47.000]  I ate a candy bar last night.
[00:35:48.456 --> 00:35:51.598]  I mean, quite frankly, I eat more junk during the holidays like everybody else.
[00:35:52.018 --> 00:35:53.299]  So I'm eating worse.
[00:35:53.919 --> 00:36:01.263]  But because I've got these trace elements, or whatever it's doing in DNA Force and X2 and Supermail, I have lost five pounds.
[00:36:01.283 --> 00:36:02.003]  It's incredible.
[00:36:02.984 --> 00:36:04.905]  I thought I might lose 10 to 15 in a month.
[00:36:05.145 --> 00:36:06.406]  If this continues, it'll be 20.
[00:36:06.506 --> 00:36:08.927]  But generally, it's more dramatic up front.
[00:36:09.527 --> 00:36:10.408]  This is an experiment.
[00:36:10.508 --> 00:36:11.268]  Everybody's watching.
[00:36:11.529 --> 00:36:12.349]  We'll see what happens.
[00:36:12.789 --> 00:36:13.930]  This is part two.
[00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:15.711]  Next week, part three.
[00:36:16.471 --> 00:36:17.052]  That's a good point.
[00:36:17.892 --> 00:36:26.998]  We just cut there and Rob Deuce said, hey Alex, I know you don't follow script, but you might want to add to people, we're running some of the biggest specials of the year until December 17th.
[00:36:27.279 --> 00:36:33.003]  That's the last day that you can get your order in and have guaranteed shipping anywhere in the United States.
[00:36:33.183 --> 00:36:34.924]  And we have some of the biggest specials of the year.
[00:36:34.944 --> 00:36:37.486]  50% off many of the nutraceuticals.
[00:36:37.806 --> 00:36:38.667]  The lowest discount is 25%.
[00:36:38.707 --> 00:36:38.847]  30% off X2.
[00:36:41.889 --> 00:36:46.053]  Huge discounts and free shipping store-wide on every product.
[00:36:46.113 --> 00:36:46.994]  Thousands of items.
[00:36:47.414 --> 00:36:51.798]  And on top of that, if you sign up for AutoShip, an additional 10% off.
[00:36:51.838 --> 00:36:55.181]  And I'm going to do one more bad thing, because I'm politically correct.
[00:36:55.662 --> 00:36:56.783]  Or I guess I'm politically incorrect.
[00:36:57.243 --> 00:36:59.285]  And that's say, Merry Christmas to everybody.
[00:36:59.605 --> 00:37:00.766]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:37:00.846 --> 00:37:01.407]  You're awesome.
[00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:12.490]  Well, we're going to take a look at the Internet of Things and how it affects your civil liberties.
[00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:14.731]  This is kind of a 2016 in review.
[00:37:15.371 --> 00:37:21.493]  So now we know that state police are actually using Fed technology to crack into smartphones.
[00:37:21.553 --> 00:37:27.214]  Now, this is technology that was previously only available to the FBI and other three-letter agencies.
[00:37:28.578 --> 00:37:47.871]  So that they are using advanced forensic technology and you know we're being told that they're only using this to go into foreign governments or look for terrorism but the fact is they're using it for absolutely everyone and they're sweeping up tons and tons of data and we've already seen how that sort of crippled them when they have to sift through all of that data.
[00:37:48.351 --> 00:37:52.575]  So they thought that this was the robust and sophisticated technology, that this was it.
[00:37:52.875 --> 00:37:54.956]  Well, now more information has come to light.
[00:37:55.117 --> 00:38:04.104]  An Israeli-based firm named Cellbrite was found to have sold advanced plug-and-play wares to regional agencies in at least 20 states, likely many more.
[00:38:04.504 --> 00:38:09.028]  This allows law enforcement to access data from thousands of different mobile devices.
[00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:15.693]  Cellbrite's technology allows the user to get around complex passcodes in most cases.
[00:38:16.634 --> 00:38:19.237]  Besides of course the iPhone 4S or above.
[00:38:19.677 --> 00:38:25.283]  They made it very portable so basically they can just put it in the back of their police car and start scooping up a bunch of data.
[00:38:25.303 --> 00:38:32.091]  The technology can and will be used to investigate anything ranging from traffic accidents to homicides.
[00:38:32.631 --> 00:38:40.983]  So they're already using this data that they keep trying to assure us is only being used for foreign actors and to go after terrorism, but it's absolutely not.
[00:38:41.023 --> 00:38:46.251]  They're scooping up all of your information and considering how connected we are, we use our cell phones for everything.
[00:38:46.291 --> 00:38:47.813]  That is a lot of information.
[00:38:48.714 --> 00:38:49.114]  The U.S.
[00:38:49.134 --> 00:38:52.195]  government can now legally access your Facebook data.
[00:38:52.575 --> 00:39:01.337]  Facebook just released its global government request report and the government's request for Facebook data actually rose 27 percent.
[00:39:01.857 --> 00:39:03.958]  This was after all of this was exposed.
[00:39:04.558 --> 00:39:12.300]  And they said at least 56 percent of these requests contained a non-disclosure order that prohibited Facebook from notifying the user.
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:18.184]  And, you know, I get tons of creeper death threats and stuff in my Facebook comments, but those people are fine.
[00:39:18.424 --> 00:39:21.827]  ISIS selling military-grade weapons on Facebook, totally fine.
[00:39:21.887 --> 00:39:25.129]  But who, what information are they getting?
[00:39:25.169 --> 00:39:31.895]  Because you see these accounts with these ISIS sympathizers and these people who are giving death threats are still, they're still up, they're totally fine.
[00:39:32.475 --> 00:39:41.062]  But now a lot of people are, of course, Christmas time, the Internet of Things, these AI smart home devices are all the rage.
[00:39:41.502 --> 00:39:49.408]  And so now experts are asking, is 2017 going to be the year your home becomes under attack from cyber criminals?
[00:39:49.448 --> 00:39:50.189]  Of course it will.
[00:39:50.789 --> 00:39:54.412]  Experts expect the number of attacks on the Internet of Things to increase.
[00:39:54.972 --> 00:39:58.875]  This includes devices like webcams, DVRs, connected thermostats.
[00:40:00.096 --> 00:40:04.599]  These are devices that lock your door or shut off the lights from your smartphone app.
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:09.403]  Everything in your house from your refrigerator to your washing machine to your dishwasher.
[00:40:09.443 --> 00:40:12.105]  Of course, we've seen hackers get into baby monitors.
[00:40:12.505 --> 00:40:20.111]  So these are all things that are going to be susceptible to cyber intrusions, but they're selling it to you as if they're going to be making your life easier.
[00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:21.472]  We're good to go.
[00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:49.372]  They're going to be the next major thing in computing platform, according to Zuckerberg.
[00:40:49.792 --> 00:40:57.175]  But this is also something that is going, they're saying that you're going to basically have the foundation of your identity will be in virtual reality.
[00:40:57.195 --> 00:40:58.876]  People are going to be using these avatars.
[00:40:59.336 --> 00:41:04.998]  So not only about the psychological aspects of this digital embodiment, that's an unknown.
[00:41:05.678 --> 00:41:12.405]  But they're also mining troves of data freely from our bodies, like head movements and facial expressions.
[00:41:12.505 --> 00:41:15.268]  They're going to be giving this to corporations and governments.
[00:41:15.569 --> 00:41:22.016]  Of course, they're giving them unprecedented insight and power over our emotions and our physical behavior.
[00:41:22.456 --> 00:41:24.818]  So, you know, they're saying that this is really just going to be used
[00:41:25.359 --> 00:41:27.740]  For advertising, but who knows?
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.180]  We have no idea what's on the horizon.
[00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:42.444]  We've seen how Facebook and others have used, you know, your eye movements and they decide, like, before you even hit purchase on the Amazon thing, the robot has already gotten it off the shelf because it knows you want to buy it.
[00:41:42.744 --> 00:41:50.926]  And they've already said that their end game, their end agenda, is to get into your thoughts and your dreams, all of your unspoken ideas.
[00:41:50.946 --> 00:41:52.567]  They want it all.
[00:41:53.187 --> 00:42:00.814]  So I wanted to let you all know that Electronic Frontier Foundation, the EFF, has actually sued the federal government.
[00:42:01.494 --> 00:42:08.380]  And they are trying to establish our rights to look at and change the code that is in our devices.
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:14.105]  Because right now, according to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, we are not allowed to protect our own civil rights.
[00:42:14.685 --> 00:42:24.227]  If our car wants to lock us out or our phone wants to only send us mass media, not any kind of alternative voices, they're allowed to do that and we can't change it.
[00:42:29.309 --> 00:42:36.130]  The theme of 2016 has been the triumph of individual will coming together for destiny.
[00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:42.372]  On our side, on the enemy's side, it has been one of abject delusion and arrogance.
[00:42:43.513 --> 00:42:47.638]  Now having said all this, why aren't I 50 points ahead, you might ask?
[00:42:48.138 --> 00:42:52.023]  This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for.
[00:42:52.063 --> 00:42:59.211]  And I'm sorry that we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold.
[00:42:59.551 --> 00:43:00.291]  For our country.
[00:43:00.551 --> 00:43:03.952]  The enemy's confidence is one of its greatest weaknesses.
[00:43:04.212 --> 00:43:06.693]  And they're about to learn that in spades.
[00:43:07.093 --> 00:43:09.634]  People always say, oh, Wall Street's pure evil.
[00:43:09.774 --> 00:43:10.214]  On the left.
[00:43:10.334 --> 00:43:10.694]  On the right.
[00:43:10.754 --> 00:43:11.875]  No, Wall Street can do no wrong.
[00:43:12.115 --> 00:43:12.535]  No.
[00:43:12.995 --> 00:43:25.619]  Big mega-banks and big brokerage firms that are above the law, pushing gun control, pushing globalism, pushing transferring our sovereignty into international bodies, they control, is conquest, is crony capitalism, is wrong.
[00:43:25.899 --> 00:43:26.379]  But most of
[00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:46.492]  First year just to stabilize things, and he is intending by year four to begin cutting.
[00:43:46.772 --> 00:43:48.833]  And by the way, what he wants to do, he's going to try.
[00:43:49.093 --> 00:43:49.833]  This isn't talk.
[00:43:50.193 --> 00:43:52.694]  You're going to see if he gets his way and we get behind him.
[00:43:52.954 --> 00:43:55.756]  Cutting spending while revenue swells.
[00:43:56.076 --> 00:44:02.378]  And of course, Krugman is flipping out today, saying this is an administration of white nationalists.
[00:44:02.798 --> 00:44:06.040]  Guess what he said in the New York Times in 1998.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:06.440]  You cannot
[00:44:09.341 --> 00:44:10.001]  Make this up.
[00:44:10.041 --> 00:44:16.625]  This is when Dinosaur Media was telling itself, don't worry, in an article about the internet, we're still going to be dominant.
[00:44:16.645 --> 00:44:20.607]  Remember back in the late 90s, the media was discussing would they be made obsolete, which has now happened?
[00:44:21.307 --> 00:44:22.408]  This is Ed Paul Krugman.
[00:44:22.508 --> 00:44:32.893]  The growth of the internet will slow drastically as the flaw in the law, McCaffey's law, which states that the number of potential connections in a network
[00:44:33.613 --> 00:44:48.505]  is proportional to the square of the number of participants because apparent most people have nothing to say to each other by 2005 or so it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine.
[00:44:49.606 --> 00:44:53.149]  Now he made that sound real scientific and real smart like an economist would
[00:44:54.025 --> 00:44:55.246]  Who's giving you a false system.
[00:44:55.506 --> 00:44:57.268]  But has the Internet gotten bigger or smaller?
[00:44:57.608 --> 00:45:02.532]  It's gotten tens of thousands of times, logarithmically, exponentially bigger.
[00:45:03.133 --> 00:45:10.960]  And they say it's only going to get bigger as it ties into the Internet of Things, exponentially as well, by the very architecture of how the Internet was built.
[00:45:12.253 --> 00:45:18.536]  And by the early 1990s, all the big tech giants had already envisioned the current system we're under.
[00:45:18.896 --> 00:45:27.561]  But Krugman writes a piece of trash a couple times a week, sits around getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, and thinks he's a rocket scientist.
[00:45:27.921 --> 00:45:35.625]  We don't need make-work projects and infrastructure because it looks like he's hiring people that are going to privatize.
[00:45:35.965 --> 00:45:37.306]  That's what you've been doing, chump.
[00:45:38.206 --> 00:45:41.869]  Giving the contracts to private companies is how we're going to get the jobs going.
[00:45:42.329 --> 00:45:46.052]  Not just shipping it overseas or paying off debts that don't exist.
[00:45:46.092 --> 00:45:50.895]  You know, all these monolithic fiat derivatives debts that should just be triaged.
[00:45:51.235 --> 00:45:51.595]  U.S.
[00:45:51.695 --> 00:46:02.163]  economic confidence surges to the highest level that Gallup, in a hundred plus years, has ever recorded.
[00:46:03.752 --> 00:46:05.493]  And they're already announcing they're going to raise interest rates.
[00:46:05.513 --> 00:46:06.394]  They've already done it once.
[00:46:06.834 --> 00:46:07.835]  They're trying to stall this.
[00:46:08.355 --> 00:46:12.458]  But now, that it's not just global, it's going to give themselves all the 0% money.
[00:46:12.478 --> 00:46:14.199]  It's time for the people to get some of that.
[00:46:14.399 --> 00:46:15.660]  And Trump wants to keep it low.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:16.501]  Uh-uh-uh.
[00:46:16.541 --> 00:46:18.762]  They say, oh, the economy's overheating.
[00:46:19.123 --> 00:46:21.304]  Trump's been president-elect for 40 days.
[00:46:21.985 --> 00:46:23.126]  He'll be in in 29.
[00:46:23.506 --> 00:46:24.787]  And we can't allow an overheating.
[00:46:25.327 --> 00:46:28.289]  So we're just gonna have to raise it maybe two or three more times before he gets in.
[00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:30.770]  Hoping it ends this Trump run.
[00:46:31.311 --> 00:46:34.693]  Crony capitalism is not letting us compete so we can be controlled.
[00:46:35.333 --> 00:46:36.114]  It's ending.
[00:46:36.554 --> 00:46:37.554]  That's why they're so mad.
[00:46:37.594 --> 00:46:42.718]  The globalists have been selling off this country and talking about what geniuses they are for decades.
[00:46:43.458 --> 00:46:51.583]  No, what you are is a bunch of backstabbing traitors that sold out the country that had over half the world's wealth till you got control of it.
[00:46:52.143 --> 00:46:53.184]  Oh yeah, comprende that.
[00:47:03.024 --> 00:47:11.170]  Our fellow info warriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:20.956]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.377 --> 00:47:28.301]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme, and they've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.742 --> 00:47:29.822]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.903 --> 00:47:38.126]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross through him, you know, an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.866 --> 00:47:44.409]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says, InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.469 --> 00:47:52.572]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder, InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.912 --> 00:47:53.472]  It's powerful.
[00:47:53.492 --> 00:47:54.533]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.

[00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:02.293]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:05.063 --> 00:49:17.429]  Well, any parent out there that's going to be sending their kid off to college really needs to be aware of just who is waiting in the wings to wrap their ideology and their agenda around your child's mind.
[00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:25.752]  You need to find out just what they're prepared to teach your child, or in the case of George Washington University, what they're not prepared to teach them at all.
[00:49:25.792 --> 00:49:26.993]  Margaret Howell joins me now.
[00:49:27.053 --> 00:49:29.274]  Now, George Washington University, this is your alma mater.
[00:49:29.594 --> 00:49:29.954]  It is!
[00:49:30.074 --> 00:49:31.355]  I have two degrees from GW.
[00:49:31.416 --> 00:49:32.096]  I did a B.A.
[00:49:32.116 --> 00:49:32.496]  and an M.A.
[00:49:32.556 --> 00:49:34.778]  both in political science, which is again at the history department.
[00:49:35.118 --> 00:49:38.221]  And get this, they're telling us students that American history is oppressive.
[00:49:38.541 --> 00:49:56.115]  That's not actually shocking, knowing that place too well, but it's saying that, we have this article, it's up on our website by Clifford Cunningham, and it talks about how the school is going to eliminate these American history classes, because as we know, Leanne, according to a lot of professors, the founding fathers are a bunch of old white rich guys that own slaves.
[00:49:56.135 --> 00:49:57.216]  They're very oppressive.
[00:49:57.236 --> 00:49:57.937]  Very oppressive.
[00:49:58.257 --> 00:50:02.479]  We need to sanitize history and we just can't teach that anymore because, you know, okay.
[00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:05.861]  Forget about the fact that this is the greatest country ever.
[00:50:05.881 --> 00:50:06.162]  Pretty much.
[00:50:06.282 --> 00:50:08.303]  No, now it's just all a bunch of white racism.
[00:50:08.323 --> 00:50:11.205]  We need to wash away our history so we can be doomed to repeat it.
[00:50:11.265 --> 00:50:16.888]  Well, the only problem with us grabbing American history and not teaching history classes at all, I mean, what kind of degree would you be getting?
[00:50:17.248 --> 00:50:19.390]  Just American then in blank by your name?
[00:50:19.871 --> 00:50:20.531]  I really don't know.
[00:50:20.792 --> 00:50:23.955]  But the fact that this university is doing this, it's not a shock at all.
[00:50:24.856 --> 00:50:28.759]  It's been off the grid in terms of whack jobs for a long time.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:35.786]  Well, this is a policy that's actually going on at about one-third of the nation's top colleges and universities.
[00:50:36.247 --> 00:50:39.350]  This happened at the University of Texas before I
[00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:40.470]  I don't know.
[00:51:01.175 --> 00:51:01.395]  Yes.
[00:51:18.351 --> 00:51:19.672]  It's such a sanitized way of saying this.
[00:51:19.712 --> 00:51:21.533]  They don't want to recruit students, they want to recruit money.
[00:51:21.813 --> 00:51:24.334]  And foreign wealthy students bring money to a school.
[00:51:24.414 --> 00:51:32.218]  It's not about, in this case, it's not about, in my opinion, diversity or about teaching an SJW type version of history.
[00:51:32.278 --> 00:51:36.120]  It's about making money, which is the bottom line for GW and frankly most universities.
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:44.324]  But moving right along to the crazy way that SJW warriors think, we have covered here on InfoWars time and again these ridiculous Trump hoaxes.
[00:51:44.464 --> 00:51:46.806]  And you brought this story to light actually right this morning.
[00:51:46.826 --> 00:51:47.346]  I'm like, this is a big
[00:51:47.586 --> 00:51:48.287]  Fantastic story!
[00:51:48.327 --> 00:51:49.167]  Why aren't we covering this?
[00:51:49.187 --> 00:51:50.148]  And we actually are!
[00:51:50.168 --> 00:51:54.771]  This man writes an obscenity on his garage door frame.
[00:51:54.811 --> 00:51:56.212]  Now, we've covered this before.
[00:51:56.232 --> 00:52:02.577]  We had the church burning in Mississippi, where a parishioner actually wrote, vote Trump a week before the election and burned down his own church.
[00:52:02.957 --> 00:52:06.740]  We had a woman accuse someone, a Trump supporter, of ripping off her burka.
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:09.982]  Now we have, I really think that this is a mental illness.
[00:52:10.022 --> 00:52:11.123]  Now we have a white man.
[00:52:12.524 --> 00:52:19.768]  Spray painting on his garage door, this racial expletive, as well as lighting his truck and his motorcycle on fire.
[00:52:19.788 --> 00:52:21.569]  Which makes a lot of sense.
[00:52:21.609 --> 00:52:25.211]  And then this GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family after the incident.
[00:52:25.831 --> 00:52:29.353]  Right, because that's what you need, a GoFundMe page after you burn down your own house.
[00:52:29.373 --> 00:52:30.273]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:52:30.313 --> 00:52:31.894]  They started the GoFundMe.
[00:52:32.194 --> 00:52:34.716]  People were trying to support them during the holiday season.
[00:52:34.756 --> 00:52:35.776]  They felt so bad for them.
[00:52:35.796 --> 00:52:37.077]  Then he comes out and admits it.
[00:52:37.757 --> 00:52:44.899]  And then they set up a different GoFundMe to say, well now we need help paying for our Christmas presents because of this incident.
[00:52:44.979 --> 00:52:46.820]  The insurance isn't going to cover it.
[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:47.960]  I don't know why!
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:50.241]  It's not like it's arson or anything.
[00:52:50.321 --> 00:52:58.483]  It makes me very angry about these hoaxes and stuff because this is the kind of stuff that is forcing us to relinquish our rights.
[00:52:58.803 --> 00:53:14.888]  We're having to be clamped down on the First Amendment and things because people are doing these hate crime hoaxes, or they're creating egg accounts, these sock puppet accounts that go around with these racial expletives on social media, and so it's forcing people to clamp down on our rights.
[00:53:15.188 --> 00:53:19.170]  We have to relinquish our rights so that everyone can feel safe, even when they're hoaxes.
[00:53:19.350 --> 00:53:20.010]  Right.
[00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:23.391]  Speaking of clamped down on the rights, Owen and David have covered this.
[00:53:23.591 --> 00:53:26.272]  Alex covered it all morning long, the NDAA.
[00:53:27.012 --> 00:53:27.072]  Yes.
[00:53:45.759 --> 00:53:50.401]  They have their own internet, sort of have control over ours, along with other oppressive dictatorships.
[00:53:50.441 --> 00:53:54.163]  And it turns out, and you know, we're supporters and defenders of Israel.
[00:53:54.223 --> 00:53:56.804]  I just put out a tweet over an Israeli soldier that I found.
[00:53:56.844 --> 00:53:57.784]  It was a beautiful photograph.
[00:53:58.084 --> 00:54:02.846]  But in this specific case that we have, we have an article aggregated from Bloomberg.
[00:54:02.906 --> 00:54:11.850]  It talks about how this one Israeli minister is going to approve a Facebook law that's against web incitement, and they don't want anybody inciting violence on the internet.
[00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:22.036]  It's understandable, it sounds okay, until you get into the nitty gritty, and it turns out they're really just censoring free speech and the right to express yourself and to express an opinion, especially if it's true.
[00:54:22.076 --> 00:54:30.441]  And sometimes we see really misguided attempts to overtly protect the innocent, and all it really does is just protect the guilty and it censors the innocent, which people need to be aware of this.
[00:54:30.601 --> 00:54:36.985]  Meanwhile, ISIS is free to sell their military-grade weapons on Facebook, they can send me death threats, that's fine.
[00:54:37.145 --> 00:54:44.607]  You know, assassinate Donald Trump page was up for quite some time, even though people were, you know, arguably upset about that.
[00:54:44.627 --> 00:54:45.327]  Right.
[00:54:45.387 --> 00:54:47.188]  But yeah, this is the Ministry of Truth.
[00:54:47.288 --> 00:54:50.729]  It's being propped up right now as we speak in our lifetime.
[00:54:50.789 --> 00:54:52.029]  What a time to be alive.
[00:54:52.049 --> 00:55:01.712]  1984 was not supposed to be an instruction manual, but I mean, President Obama, they kind of said that it was all because of the election and all this fake news, and he came out saying
[00:55:02.412 --> 00:55:03.153]  Truthiness!
[00:55:03.393 --> 00:55:17.089]  We need a truthiness filter and now they've actually created it, they've set it all up as if Facebook is only going to use these filters in communist China or, you know, in Israel or other places where they're asking them to create these filters.
[00:55:17.329 --> 00:55:25.270]  And not to get off topic here, because I hate doing that to our producers, because it drives them nuts, but really quickly, you talk about having a fake news crisis of sorts.
[00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:27.791]  If you go onto any fake news website, i.e.
[00:55:27.911 --> 00:55:40.893]  ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, the stories of today, the stories du jour are, you know, Trump is going to be kissy-faced with Putin, Putin the dictator, you know, these ridiculous big, bad Russia stories are still being propagated.
[00:55:40.933 --> 00:55:41.893]  Those aren't censored.
[00:55:42.633 --> 00:55:46.214]  But if you're spouting any sort of truth at all, if you want to tell people the truth,
[00:55:46.374 --> 00:55:47.115]  I'm going to tell it like it is.
[00:55:47.475 --> 00:55:51.498]  You might be censored under, you know, this Facebook law or under the NDAA.
[00:55:52.298 --> 00:55:55.961]  Right, this countering Foreign Propaganda Act that was put in the NDAA.
[00:55:55.981 --> 00:56:01.845]  Of course, they're saying that they're going to be pushing out FACT-BASED propaganda.
[00:56:01.925 --> 00:56:03.126]  But that's the thing.
[00:56:03.186 --> 00:56:09.671]  We're supposed to be fact-checking the government and these government agencies who are giving us all of these facts.
[00:56:09.791 --> 00:56:11.212]  We're not supposed to check them.
[00:56:11.252 --> 00:56:12.993]  We're just supposed to take them at their word.
[00:56:13.013 --> 00:56:14.234]  Don't you question those facts!
[00:56:14.594 --> 00:56:15.134]  That's right.
[00:56:15.474 --> 00:56:17.796]  And don't you dare call them fake news.
[00:56:17.816 --> 00:56:19.116]  They're the establishment media.
[00:56:19.136 --> 00:56:20.417]  They've been around forever.
[00:56:20.657 --> 00:56:21.237]  Exactly.
[00:56:21.257 --> 00:56:22.378]  And if you do, you're going to be censored.
[00:56:22.678 --> 00:56:25.579]  Speaking of which, so we've been covering here on InfoWars.
[00:56:25.699 --> 00:56:28.661]  Owen and I did a piece about Obama's last three days in office.
[00:56:28.681 --> 00:56:29.641]  What is he doing other than
[00:56:29.721 --> 00:56:30.361]  We're good to go.
[00:56:48.287 --> 00:56:48.848]  I think so.
[00:57:08.328 --> 00:57:09.569]  That's right, that's right.
[00:57:09.609 --> 00:57:12.311]  So we have these refugees from Syria and one's from Libya.
[00:57:12.371 --> 00:57:13.812]  The other six are from Syria.
[00:57:13.852 --> 00:57:20.217]  This aggregated from RT, my former boss, and it talks about how they lit a homeless man on fire in Berlin.
[00:57:20.958 --> 00:57:22.539]  There's actually CCTV video.
[00:57:22.959 --> 00:57:26.982]  All of these people had refugee or asylum status in their paperwork.
[00:57:27.062 --> 00:57:29.984]  So we really need to be cautious and be careful in question.
[00:57:30.125 --> 00:57:33.107]  Even these last 28 days, all the damage he's doing to our nation,
[00:57:33.387 --> 00:57:43.871]  Well, he's trying to ram through this agenda regardless of the fact that because everything has been pushed through with these executive orders, they're going to be easily overturned by a Trump administration.
[00:57:44.271 --> 00:57:56.136]  However, if you've already ramped up the refugee program, it's not as if they're going to just easily deport all these people or somehow clamp down on the vast amount of numbers that are coming in.
[00:57:56.816 --> 00:58:11.751]  On that note, with the people coming in, we'll just close with this Drexel University professor, very much trending, because his Christmas tweet to everyone over the weekend was that, all I want for Christmas is white genocide.
[00:58:12.652 --> 00:58:19.698]  Newsflash, start with yourself, buddy, because you are an effing white male with a very cliche
[00:58:20.459 --> 00:58:21.119]  Facial hair!
[00:58:21.139 --> 00:58:21.840]  That's raw!
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:46.410]  So this is a guy who, if you were a parent out there sending your kid to this school, you could actually look on his bio, you could look on his bio and he says he's a communist and he's going to be teaching your kids all about communism and how great it is, and he's also going to be teaching them about how when white people were massacred during the Haitian Revolution, for instance, that's a good thing, and this white genocide is a great
[00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:48.911]  Concept, although it's imaginary.
[00:58:49.372 --> 00:58:51.434]  So there again, we'll kind of end where we started.
[00:58:51.794 --> 00:58:54.196]  You need to know who is teaching your children.
[00:58:54.496 --> 00:58:55.917]  Now that is going to do it for the show tonight.
[00:58:55.957 --> 00:58:57.198]  Thank you all so much for joining us.
[00:58:57.238 --> 00:58:58.940]  We'll see you here tomorrow, 7 p.m.
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:58:59.280]  Central.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.934]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.394 --> 00:59:20.085]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:24.186]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.726 --> 00:59:29.407]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.787 --> 00:59:35.989]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:38.610]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:41.710]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:59:42.091 --> 00:59:47.592]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:59:48.032 --> 00:59:54.696]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
