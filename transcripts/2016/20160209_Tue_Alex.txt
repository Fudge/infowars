[00:00:00.315 --> 00:00:02.943]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.595]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:20.256 --> 00:00:21.037]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.818 --> 00:00:22.699]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.004]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.565 --> 00:00:31.629]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:38.553]  We are live on this Tuesday, February 9th.
[00:00:38.593 --> 00:00:39.954]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:39.994 --> 00:00:41.416]  I'll be filling in for Alex.
[00:00:41.496 --> 00:00:42.657]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:00:43.237 --> 00:00:50.423]  In the third hour, we've got an exclusive interview with anti-Islamist activist and author Tommy Robinson.
[00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:51.705]  He's been on the show before.
[00:00:52.385 --> 00:01:02.227]  He, of course, took part in the Pegida UK demonstrations on Saturday, which happened in several different UK cities, as well as others across Europe.
[00:01:02.707 --> 00:01:04.728]  So that's going to be a really interesting discussion.
[00:01:04.748 --> 00:01:10.669]  I'm going to try and take your calls during that interview and, if possible, in the second hour.
[00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:16.831]  Alex Jones might be popping in in the second hour, but we'll try and get to your calls at some point.
[00:01:17.932 --> 00:01:25.575]  But Fox News has kind of jumped the gun on the New Hampshire primaries by publishing the results in advance.
[00:01:25.935 --> 00:01:28.676]  This broke a couple of hours ago on Infowars.com.
[00:01:29.516 --> 00:01:41.341]  Fox News is reporting the final results of tonight's Republican and Democratic primaries in advance with a mock-up page showing establishment favourite Marco Rubio finishing in second place.
[00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:53.016]  Now, what obviously happened here was they had some kind of beta test for their website script, which would count the votes as they were coming in during tonight's primary.
[00:01:53.517 --> 00:02:00.982]  But somebody at Fox News obviously released that page and published it live to the internet a little too early.
[00:02:01.582 --> 00:02:22.182]  Now, as you will note in the article, I'm not saying that this is some dark, shadowy conspiracy on behalf of Fox News, but it's interesting nonetheless, because about 30 minutes after this article was published on Infowars.com, which shows the full results of the New Hampshire primary, despite the fact that basically no votes have taken place yet,
[00:02:23.072 --> 00:02:27.654]  Fox News then reset all the totals back to 0%.
[00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:35.098]  So they had Trump as the winner on 28%, they had Rubio in second on 15%, Cruz in third on 12%.
[00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:43.223]  And again, this was live on the foxnews.com website, and it has been since at least yesterday.
[00:02:43.603 --> 00:02:45.364]  People started to pick up on it today.
[00:02:46.141 --> 00:02:48.722]  They also had the result of the Democratic primary.
[00:02:49.023 --> 00:02:52.925]  They had Bernie Sanders 10% in front of Hillary Clinton.
[00:02:53.325 --> 00:03:00.229]  Of course, if you look at the polls, he's set to beat her by an average of 14% if you look at the cross-polling figures.
[00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:06.132]  So basically, this was laid out in public by Fox News on their own website.
[00:03:06.572 --> 00:03:08.353]  Yes, it was not a conspiracy.
[00:03:08.393 --> 00:03:09.914]  It was obviously a mock-up page.
[00:03:10.254 --> 00:03:14.357]  They were beta-testing how they would count the votes as they roll in.
[00:03:15.077 --> 00:03:17.598]  But what's interesting, of course, is that they then pulled it.
[00:03:17.638 --> 00:03:20.460]  They reset all the totals back to 0%.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.981]  30 minutes after this article was published.
[00:03:24.362 --> 00:03:30.004]  Now you have people all over Twitter saying, they never published the results of the New Hampshire primary.
[00:03:30.064 --> 00:03:32.105]  Look, I'm visiting the page right now.
[00:03:32.165 --> 00:03:33.306]  It says 0%.
[00:03:33.686 --> 00:03:36.107]  Well, yes, it's because they flipped it back.
[00:03:36.888 --> 00:03:40.830]  What's interesting about this, of course, if you compare it to a couple of weeks ago,
[00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:48.133]  We had Microsoft with their app helping to count the votes for the Iowa caucus.
[00:03:48.193 --> 00:03:57.499]  Of course, many Trump supporters complained that that aided Marco Rubio, who is in bed with Microsoft, and that it may have helped him cheat in Iowa.
[00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:58.940]  There was no evidence for that.
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:07.409]  But Microsoft did release their predicted results of Iowa almost a week before the primary itself.
[00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:10.613]  Of course, that was a close race between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.
[00:04:11.213 --> 00:04:19.503]  Microsoft, through their Bing predictive technology, released the results and said that Hillary Clinton would beat Bernie Sanders.
[00:04:20.043 --> 00:04:24.066]  So people ask the question, was this predictive programming?
[00:04:24.466 --> 00:04:32.591]  If people think that, you know, Hillary's a shoo-in, that she's guaranteed to beat Sanders, does that make them less likely to vote for Sanders?
[00:04:33.151 --> 00:04:43.538]  Could we be seeing a similar thing with this Fox News article about them publishing the results of the New Hampshire primary before any votes have been made?
[00:04:44.198 --> 00:04:57.811]  It's a very interesting proposition, especially if the final tally, when it comes out later tonight and tomorrow, matches with the tally published by Fox News at least 24 hours in advance.
[00:04:57.851 --> 00:04:59.793]  We'll get more into it after the break.
[00:04:59.813 --> 00:05:01.074]  A ton of news coming up.
[00:05:01.414 --> 00:05:03.276]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[00:05:03.576 --> 00:05:04.237]  Don't go away.
[00:05:09.406 --> 00:05:25.480]  If polls are to be believed, Hillary Clinton's once commanding national lead over Bernie Sanders appears to have evaporated in a matter of days, pointing to trouble ahead for the former Secretary of State as voters cast their ballots Tuesday in Sanders-friendly New Hampshire, reports Fox News.
[00:05:25.861 --> 00:05:34.949]  A recent Reuters poll shows Clinton leading Sanders 48 to 45, while state polls are far better indicators going into each individual primary.
[00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:37.910]  National polls help gauge the candidate's broader appeal.
[00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:49.272]  Over the past several months, Clinton has at times led the national polls by more than 30 points, contributing to her front-runner label, even as she has faced tough races in Iowa and New Hampshire.
[00:05:49.492 --> 00:06:00.635]  But Sanders may be heading for a big win in New Hampshire Tuesday night, if he can hold off Clinton, who has gotten tougher on the Vermont senator in recent days, as her husband Bill Clinton ratchets up his attacks.
[00:06:01.296 --> 00:06:03.782]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com
[00:06:11.144 --> 00:06:14.526]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:06:14.886 --> 00:06:23.692]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war as the enemy approached, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:06:24.292 --> 00:06:32.697]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:06:32.717 --> 00:06:37.079]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.561]  Pathenogens added to the food and water,
[00:06:39.761 --> 00:06:46.683]  ...into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:06:47.123 --> 00:06:52.525]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex, the latest product from InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:06:52.785 --> 00:06:58.826]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with Anthroplex.

[00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:13.042]  But where do you get it?

[00:07:44.965 --> 00:07:46.166]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:47.227]  Easy assembly.
[00:07:47.507 --> 00:07:48.127]  Low maintenance.
[00:07:48.408 --> 00:07:50.249]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:08:18.601 --> 00:08:20.725]  We have gangsters running this country.
[00:08:21.146 --> 00:08:21.607]  Criminals!
[00:08:21.748 --> 00:08:22.249]  Gangsters!
[00:08:22.289 --> 00:08:25.094]  The bigger this war gets, the more freedoms we lose.
[00:08:27.846 --> 00:08:30.888]  We have a fog that has descended on our entire nation.
[00:08:30.948 --> 00:08:33.069]  The globalists are going to blow stuff up and blame it on you.
[00:08:33.109 --> 00:08:35.010]  Well, Hillary's the one who runs the cover-up.
[00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:40.252]  Everything you've heard us talk about is now going to unfold in triplicate spades.
[00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:41.693]  It's as real as it gets.
[00:08:42.073 --> 00:08:45.475]  I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face, it's over for me.
[00:08:45.695 --> 00:08:46.936]  To Matt, it's over for you.
[00:08:46.976 --> 00:08:49.097]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[00:08:49.377 --> 00:08:49.957]  You're out of there.
[00:08:50.237 --> 00:08:51.878]  You want it, baby?
[00:08:52.158 --> 00:08:53.679]  You're about to get it.
[00:09:00.222 --> 00:09:08.105]  We just met the British at Concord Bridge to serve tea, be tolerant, and see how many guns or what kind of guns they came to take.
[00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:12.968]  We met them at Concord Bridge, and we blew their punk-ass brains out.
[00:09:13.328 --> 00:09:25.093]  InfoWars has been able to break every record, infiltrate every operation, blow the criminal cover of operatives more than any other institution out there of freedom, and I'm so proud of that.
[00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:28.475]  The notion that Hillary has somehow been an advocate for women.
[00:09:28.515 --> 00:09:33.457]  No, Bill rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[00:09:33.477 --> 00:09:43.083]  I hope the enemies of this broadcast, when you lie about us, when you censor us, when you attack us, when you delist us, when you do that, you're signing on to the other side.
[00:09:43.323 --> 00:09:45.484]  These people are of the devil.
[00:09:45.524 --> 00:09:47.385]  Let's be very blunt about this.
[00:09:47.825 --> 00:09:50.990]  Raise, tell, and demand accountability.
[00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:55.377]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate, criminal government in American history.
[00:09:58.757 --> 00:10:03.760]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:10:06.721 --> 00:10:10.283]  On the Alex Jones Show, I'm Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex today.
[00:10:10.903 --> 00:10:14.405]  And as I was discussing before the break, Fox News jumped the gun.
[00:10:14.445 --> 00:10:22.930]  They announced the results of the New Hampshire primary at least 24 hours in advance with a mock-up webpage on their own official website.
[00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.912]  Stating that establishment favourite Marco Rubio would come in second.
[00:10:27.952 --> 00:10:32.694]  Now Rubio himself has expressed doubt about whether he will achieve that.
[00:10:32.734 --> 00:10:34.314]  He says he may even come in fourth.
[00:10:34.774 --> 00:10:39.876]  And of course all the discussion has been from the pundits that Rubio has to beat Kasich.
[00:10:39.956 --> 00:10:41.557]  He has to beat Chris Christie.
[00:10:41.617 --> 00:10:43.598]  He has to beat Jeb Bush.
[00:10:43.978 --> 00:10:51.101]  He has to come out on top of the establishment candidates to then become the primary challenger to Trump and Cruz.
[00:10:51.781 --> 00:10:54.224]  So, interesting that Fox would come out with this.
[00:10:54.885 --> 00:11:05.779]  Obviously, it's not a dark, shadowy conspiracy, which I said in the article that's not the case, even though some people in the comments were like, how dare InfoWars suggest that this is some kind of conspiracy?
[00:11:05.819 --> 00:11:06.921]  It's obviously a beta test.
[00:11:07.762 --> 00:11:16.469]  Well yes it is, but it's also interesting that they then removed it immediately after we published this article, and it started to get a lot of traction on the web.
[00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:28.440]  Because again, Microsoft a couple of weeks ago before Iowa, came out with their own prediction based on their Bing technology, that Hillary Clinton would beat Bernie Sanders, and that's exactly what happened.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.642]  Is it predictive programming?
[00:11:30.722 --> 00:11:33.024]  Could it sway people to vote a certain way?
[00:11:33.624 --> 00:11:42.435]  Well that's up for debate, but what's not up for debate is that they published the full results of the New Hampshire primary 100% of votes in.
[00:11:42.836 --> 00:11:44.238]  And they actually went into detail.
[00:11:45.099 --> 00:11:49.724]  They went town by town and tallied up all the different votes via that way.
[00:11:50.305 --> 00:11:54.068]  So this wasn't just a blanket superficial prediction.
[00:11:54.428 --> 00:11:55.829]  They went into detail with this.
[00:11:55.869 --> 00:11:58.592]  Somebody hit the publish button by mistake.
[00:11:59.092 --> 00:12:01.474]  It's been up on the internet for about 24 hours now.
[00:12:01.514 --> 00:12:02.194]  They've pulled it.
[00:12:02.715 --> 00:12:11.562]  But again, it's going to be very interesting to see if the final result tallies with what Fox News published yesterday.
[00:12:12.262 --> 00:12:13.983]  Now we're going to get on to some more news soon.
[00:12:14.003 --> 00:12:25.553]  We've got quite a prominent person in the political sphere for a couple of decades now who is predicting that the GOP will rig New Hampshire to help Marco Rubio.
[00:12:25.573 --> 00:12:32.478]  We're going to tell you about that in a moment but first here's John Bowne with a special report on impeachment.
[00:12:32.538 --> 00:12:33.079]  Here's the clip.
[00:12:35.751 --> 00:12:42.837]  Regarding executive orders, the Constitution states in Article 2, Section 3, Clause 5, that the executive, i.e.
[00:12:42.897 --> 00:12:48.561]  the President, take care that the laws be faithfully executed or face impeachment.
[00:12:48.861 --> 00:12:52.805]  Specifically, an executive order must find support in the Constitution.
[00:12:52.965 --> 00:13:02.973]  Watering down the Second Amendment in order to confiscate the lawful right of a majority of Americans to protect themselves can hardly mean the laws are being faithfully executed.
[00:13:03.653 --> 00:13:08.634]  The conversation has to be based on facts and truth and what we're actually proposing.
[00:13:09.034 --> 00:13:15.235]  A big miss for Obama as he failed to explain to all of us what is contained in his latest executive order.
[00:13:15.455 --> 00:13:25.217]  Allowing HIPAA to protect doctors that order gun confiscation of their patients based on vague conditions is what's really sending alarm bells ringing.
[00:13:25.517 --> 00:13:30.198]  As if the health care system wasn't screwed up enough unconstitutionally by Obama.
[00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:32.278]  We heard not only from the gun lobby
[00:13:33.138 --> 00:13:44.808]  But from United States Senators, that expanding background checks will, not may, will lead to a registry, which will lead to confiscation, which will lead to a tyrannical government.
[00:13:45.088 --> 00:13:58.299]  Let's not forget that Gabrielle Giffords thankfully survived the 2011 Tucson shooting by the possibly MKUltra victimized Jared Lee Loeffner, who erratically declared to the police while victims were still being treated,
[00:13:58.559 --> 00:14:02.203]  I just want you to know that I'm the only person that knew about this.
[00:14:02.644 --> 00:14:03.164]  Strange.
[00:14:03.545 --> 00:14:12.495]  Unfortunately, federal judge John Roll, a staunch blockade to Obama's future immigration invasion, was murdered, along with five others.
[00:14:12.836 --> 00:14:14.137]  Talk about a conspiracy.
[00:14:14.277 --> 00:14:15.198]  I'm sorry, Cooper.
[00:14:15.218 --> 00:14:16.980]  Yes, it is fair to call it a conspiracy.
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.021]  What are you saying?
[00:14:20.785 --> 00:14:30.997]  Are you suggesting that the notion that we are creating a plot to take everybody's guns away so that we can impose martial law?
[00:14:31.077 --> 00:14:35.202]  While you've been president, we are at the lowest murder rate in our country.
[00:14:35.563 --> 00:14:36.324]  All time low.
[00:14:36.724 --> 00:14:37.145]  I grew up in Kentucky.
[00:14:37.165 --> 00:14:38.847]  Trust me, those guns aren't just for hunting.
[00:14:38.927 --> 00:14:41.590]  And secondly, Obama, you don't know a damn thing about Kentucky.
[00:14:54.966 --> 00:14:58.607]  Well, I've got bad news for all of you that scoff at the word impeachment.
[00:14:58.967 --> 00:15:06.869]  Once Obama leaves office, he will have set the table for global government to legally come in and feast on the American public.
[00:15:07.089 --> 00:15:10.050]  Obama trade, with its laws that bypass the U.S.
[00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:12.930]  Congress for the benefit of the banking corporate elite.
[00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:20.412]  Obamacare, a middle class destroying Stasi-esque data collection system masquerading as a healthcare system.
[00:15:20.692 --> 00:15:24.775]  Obamagration, flooding our cities with criminals and jihadists.
[00:15:25.155 --> 00:15:36.204]  And now Obamafiscation, a solitary push to reduce the threat posed by armed Americans as the final dish by the New World Order's puppet is presented to the table.
[00:15:36.384 --> 00:15:46.532]  By not impeaching Obama, our nationalist apathy will legally and necessarily aid and abet the death of the United States of America.
[00:15:46.952 --> 00:15:47.792]  The time is now.
[00:15:47.912 --> 00:15:52.994]  Call your representative at 202-224-3121.
[00:15:53.335 --> 00:15:55.095]  Operators are standing by.
[00:15:55.455 --> 00:16:04.959]  And if your representative needs more information, direct them to the NorthAmericanLawCenter.org's Articles of Impeachment of Barack Hussein Obama at the very top of their webpage.
[00:16:05.379 --> 00:16:07.240]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[00:16:12.679 --> 00:16:19.906]  There's John Bowne with a special report now, continuing from Fox News publishing the results of the New Hampshire primary.
[00:16:20.406 --> 00:16:23.429]  In advance, we've also got this story up on m4wars.com.
[00:16:24.029 --> 00:16:27.773]  Dilbert creator predicts GOP will rig New Hampshire.
[00:16:28.193 --> 00:16:33.778]  Now, of course, we have these charges after Iowa with Microsoft with their app counting the vote.
[00:16:33.858 --> 00:16:35.180]  Trump supporters felt that
[00:16:35.976 --> 00:16:40.038]  Rubio had cheated to attain his surprise third place position.
[00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:48.163]  Now we've got the creator of the Dilbert cartoon series saying if they don't fix the race, or they fix it only a little, Trump will win big.
[00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:58.249]  Scott Adams, the creator of the popular Dilbert cartoon series, predicts that the GOP will rig tonight's primary in New Hampshire to favour establishment favourite Marco Rubio.
[00:16:58.749 --> 00:17:03.872]  In a blog posting, Adams argues there is too much at stake for the Fixers not to do anything to counter the juggernaut
[00:17:04.512 --> 00:17:06.194]  of Donald Trump's campaign.
[00:17:07.015 --> 00:17:07.956]  Listen to what he said.
[00:17:08.376 --> 00:17:15.463]  There is no natural reason to expect Rubio, the establishment candidate, to have another surprise surge as he did in Iowa.
[00:17:15.943 --> 00:17:27.815]  And of course he points to Rubio's poor performance in Saturday night's debate when he got called out by Chris Christie on basically being a wind-up toy, repeating the same phrases over and over again.
[00:17:29.071 --> 00:17:41.664]  So, Dilbert, the creator of Dilbert continues, for Rubio to have a surprisingly strong second place showing in New Hampshire, look for the most common explanations for that surprise to be his momentum from Iowa.
[00:17:42.264 --> 00:17:46.509]  I assume that most of you think it's conspiracy talk and not to be taken seriously.
[00:17:47.415 --> 00:17:54.825]  But he points out that he predicted the rise of Trump back in September when everybody else was saying it wasn't going to happen.
[00:17:55.346 --> 00:18:01.674]  So that's somebody who's been quite prominent in political circles, definitely not a conspiracy theorist, God forbid.
[00:18:02.495 --> 00:18:07.238]  Predicting that the establishment will rig it tonight again to help Rubio.
[00:18:07.278 --> 00:18:13.722]  Because they've predicted that he needs to come out on top of the establishment candidates to challenge Trump and Cruz.
[00:18:14.322 --> 00:18:18.044]  Because it's all going to be about who finishes second and third.
[00:18:18.445 --> 00:18:22.007]  They're going to completely ignore the fact that Sanders and Trump are going to win.
[00:18:22.467 --> 00:18:35.860]  They're going to argue and debate about the margin with which they win to try and denigrate those victories because they're terrified of either Sanders or Trump becoming the nominee in both cases.
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.762]  So they're going to try and pump up Rubio.
[00:18:38.802 --> 00:18:44.608]  That's what they did after Iowa kind of backfired after his gaffe during Saturday night's debate.
[00:18:44.648 --> 00:18:45.328]  Now we've got this
[00:18:46.189 --> 00:18:52.534]  Marco Rubio repeats same line again, and this was during a stump speech after the debate.
[00:18:52.614 --> 00:18:56.917]  So we've got this clip of Marco Rubio again acting like a wind-up toy.
[00:18:56.957 --> 00:18:57.437]  Here it is.
[00:18:58.118 --> 00:19:03.241]  We are taking our message to families that are struggling to raise their children in the 21st century.
[00:19:03.562 --> 00:19:07.324]  Because as you saw, Jeanette and I are raising our four children in the 21st century.
[00:19:07.545 --> 00:19:13.249]  And we know how hard it's become to instill our values in our kids, instead of the values they try to ram down our throats.
[00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:26.712]  In the 21st century, it's become harder than ever to instill in your children the values they teach in our homes and in our church, instead of the values that they try to ram down our throats in the movies, in music, in popular culture.
[00:19:27.573 --> 00:19:35.754]  So again, literally it's like one of those toys that you pull the cord and it's got like three stock phrases that it comes out with over and over again.
[00:19:36.454 --> 00:19:42.376]  After the break, we're going to play this other video clip where he actually debates himself.
[00:19:42.456 --> 00:19:44.516]  He contradicts himself over and over again.
[00:19:44.896 --> 00:19:48.357]  Of course, he's been claiming that Obama knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:19:48.977 --> 00:19:53.278]  Just a matter of weeks and months ago, Rubio said the exact opposite.
[00:19:53.298 --> 00:19:54.799]  We're going to go to that clip after the break.
[00:19:55.159 --> 00:20:03.561]  We've also got another, yet another, top security chief in Europe warning about mass civil unrest as a result of this mass immigration policy.
[00:20:03.881 --> 00:20:05.341]  We'll be back after the break.
[00:20:05.361 --> 00:20:06.862]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[00:20:06.882 --> 00:20:07.342]  Stay tuned.
[00:20:09.813 --> 00:20:13.015]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?

[00:21:09.062 --> 00:21:11.823]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[00:21:12.123 --> 00:21:14.744]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[00:21:14.764 --> 00:21:15.184]  Croix River.
[00:21:15.505 --> 00:21:17.505]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[00:21:17.726 --> 00:21:20.447]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:21:20.687 --> 00:21:21.207]  His excuse?
[00:21:21.567 --> 00:21:22.647]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:21:22.908 --> 00:21:24.188]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[00:21:24.508 --> 00:21:30.010]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[00:22:12.696 --> 00:22:13.197]  It's true.
[00:22:13.317 --> 00:22:17.263]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:22:17.464 --> 00:22:19.326]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:22:19.867 --> 00:22:24.354]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[00:23:08.334 --> 00:23:11.876]  Attention, listeners of this radio station are set to get free survival food.
[00:23:12.276 --> 00:23:18.799]  Farmers vow to keep up with the rush to supply every listener who calls and beats the deadline to claim free 72-hour survival food kits.
[00:23:19.059 --> 00:23:22.300]  In a crisis, your number one need is food, but not just any food.
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.702]  Experts recommend good-for-25-years survival food.
[00:23:26.022 --> 00:23:33.065]  In an unprecedented move, Food for Patriots 72-hour survival food kits are being given away to listeners of this radio station.
[00:23:33.505 --> 00:23:38.668]  According to a company spokesman, this is happening because we're worried that the people in Washington have an agenda.
[00:23:38.888 --> 00:23:40.569]  Control the food, control the people.
[00:23:40.889 --> 00:23:44.131]  You don't want to rely on the government to keep your family fed in a crisis.
[00:23:44.451 --> 00:23:49.534]  The normal price of these kits is $27 plus shipping, but listeners who act now get them free.

[00:24:23.496 --> 00:24:32.561]  We're back, it's the Alex Jones Show Live, third hour, we've got Tommy Robinson coming up, the anti-Islamisation activist and author.
[00:24:32.581 --> 00:24:34.982]  We're going to take your calls for him as well.
[00:24:35.002 --> 00:24:46.949]  Of course we're going to dip back into what's happening with the New Hampshire primary, but first I need to draw your attention to InfoWarsLife.com, because again we've got a great selection of new products
[00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:49.870]  This is how we fund the entire operation.
[00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:51.511]  This is how we finance the show.
[00:24:51.811 --> 00:25:07.619]  This is how we finance sending reporters to Paris, to Bilderberg, to Oregon, to wherever news is breaking so we can challenge the mainstream media directly and basically get in their face and try and hijack, take over the narrative.
[00:25:07.979 --> 00:25:18.228]  Because we're not funded by George Soros, we're not funded by hundreds of millions of dollars in pharmaceutical advertising like the big networks, so we rely on your support.
[00:25:18.648 --> 00:25:24.473]  And over at Infowarslife.com right now we've got Anthroplex, the twice daily pill formulation for men.
[00:25:25.214 --> 00:25:33.797]  And it synergistically works with Super Male Vitality, which has obviously proven very popular, by using key ingredients that boost male stamina.
[00:25:34.217 --> 00:25:42.820]  Anthroplex was created to help restore your masculine foundation and fight back against the attack on men with gender-bending chemicals in our food and water supply.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:51.203]  And for a limited time, when you buy the synergistic duo of Anthroplex and Super Male Vitality together at infowarslife.com.

[00:26:27.791 --> 00:26:41.383]  Now before the break we were talking about Marco Rubio, who of course got called out for basically being a wind-up toy repeating the same phrase over and over again, claiming that Barack Obama knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:26:42.043 --> 00:26:48.865]  Well, that struck a somewhat different tone to what Rubio himself was saying just a few months ago.
[00:26:49.565 --> 00:26:53.706]  Here's Rubio versus Rubio, Marco debates himself.
[00:26:53.726 --> 00:26:54.446]  Here's the clip.
[00:26:56.306 --> 00:27:00.067]  And let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:27:00.087 --> 00:27:01.468]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:27:01.488 --> 00:27:04.008]  I'm going to say something I don't take lightly.
[00:27:04.028 --> 00:27:08.129]  The American foreign policy is in the hands of someone who does not know what he's doing.
[00:27:15.149 --> 00:27:18.433]  I think the experience is not just what you did, but how it worked out.
[00:27:18.973 --> 00:27:19.694]  But I would add this.
[00:27:19.754 --> 00:27:22.838]  Let's dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:27:23.138 --> 00:27:24.439]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:27:24.459 --> 00:27:27.002]  Well, people, first of all, are scared because they sense the threat.
[00:27:27.042 --> 00:27:29.164]  It continues to grow and the president doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:27:29.465 --> 00:27:31.847]  We are not facing a president that doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:27:31.887 --> 00:27:32.989]  He knows what he is doing.
[00:27:33.009 --> 00:27:36.813]  I mean, how can the American people have confidence that this president knows what he is doing?
[00:27:37.133 --> 00:27:38.235]  Well, here's the response.
[00:27:38.476 --> 00:27:43.166]  Anyone who believes that Barack Obama isn't doing what he's doing on purpose doesn't understand what we're dealing with here.
[00:27:43.186 --> 00:27:45.310]  We're talking about someone who does not know what he's doing.
[00:27:47.062 --> 00:27:50.104]  There's Marco Rubio debating himself.
[00:27:50.284 --> 00:27:55.047]  A few months ago he asserted that Barack Obama didn't know what he was doing.
[00:27:55.467 --> 00:27:58.269]  Now he says Obama knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:27:59.089 --> 00:28:05.993]  Which is funny, you know, because Marco Rubio has aligned with Obama on numerous different major issues.
[00:28:06.033 --> 00:28:09.656]  So if Obama knows exactly what he's doing, as Rubio claims now,
[00:28:10.416 --> 00:28:16.922]  Then Rubio would be in a perfect position to know that, given that he supported many of the same policies.
[00:28:17.322 --> 00:28:23.607]  The primary one being Barack Obama's involvement in the Middle East, and particularly Syria.
[00:28:24.248 --> 00:28:32.755]  Marco Rubio has voted and he's rhetorically supported arming the jihadist rebels in Syria again and again.
[00:28:33.255 --> 00:28:35.437]  To supposedly take on Russia.
[00:28:35.998 --> 00:28:40.201]  Now of course that was Barack Obama's disastrous policy right from the very beginning.
[00:28:40.842 --> 00:28:47.088]  We pointed out that the quote Syrian rebels, the FSA, were in fact jihadists themselves.
[00:28:47.168 --> 00:28:49.089]  We were proven completely correct.
[00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:54.051]  More than half of them eventually turned out not to be moderate at all.
[00:28:54.091 --> 00:29:10.757]  They ended up giving their weapons to ISIS, defecting to Jabhat al-Nusra and these other Al-Qaeda groups, which created the bloodbath in Syria, which created this mass immigration crisis that is now impacting Europe and will eventually impact America.
[00:29:11.437 --> 00:29:13.459]  Barack Obama was responsible for that.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.002]  He pushed for arming the jihadist rebels.
[00:29:16.482 --> 00:29:17.603]  He ignored Assad.
[00:29:17.643 --> 00:29:20.566]  He ignored a political solution for such a long time.
[00:29:20.907 --> 00:29:27.974]  And at every step of the way, Marco Rubio, the fake conservative, was behind him in that goal.
[00:29:28.574 --> 00:29:31.177]  You can look at the NSA surveillance issue.
[00:29:32.003 --> 00:29:43.831]  Immediately after the Paris Massacre in November, Rubio came out and attacked Cruz and said that we need more NSA surveillance in America to stop terror attacks like the one in Paris.
[00:29:43.871 --> 00:29:52.737]  Of course, the attack in Paris couldn't have been stopped by more surveillance because the terrorists were directly communicating with each other and they came in via the refugee program.
[00:29:53.037 --> 00:29:54.718]  We'll get more into it after the break.
[00:29:54.778 --> 00:29:57.340]  It's the Alex Jones Show Live, InfoWars.com.
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.161]  Now go away.
[00:29:58.641 --> 00:29:59.561]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.042 --> 00:30:01.662]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.583 --> 00:30:05.344]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.806 --> 00:30:14.188]  A pro-abortion group is attacking a Doritos Super Bowl ad for humanizing baby fetuses.
[00:30:14.628 --> 00:30:21.851]  In the ad, a pregnant woman is getting an ultrasound while a man besides her realizes the unborn baby will move in the direction of the Doritos he's snacking on.
[00:30:22.111 --> 00:30:26.973]  The man toys with the baby, attempting in vain to reach the chips from the womb until the mother throws the Doritos across the room.
[00:30:27.113 --> 00:30:30.097]  Which prompts the child to launch itself outside mom and towards the chips.
[00:30:30.317 --> 00:30:37.147]  In response, the National Abortion Reproductive Rights Action League said the ad used an anti-choice tactic of humanizing fetuses.
[00:30:37.467 --> 00:30:42.815]  The statement also scores out an oral and similar groups to humanize the unborn in a vain attempt to justify abortions.
[00:30:43.075 --> 00:30:48.977]  Especially in the aftermath of the Planned Parenthood sting videos exposing its officials admitting they sell aborted baby organs for profit.
[00:30:49.357 --> 00:30:50.918]  Naral, however, didn't stop there.
[00:30:51.238 --> 00:30:57.100]  The group also called out a Snickers ad for being transphobic and a Hyundai ad for showing a dad take away his daughter's autonomy.
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:04.302]  This is all part of the political correctness campaign spearheaded by the authoritarian left to not only control free speech, but also how people think.
[00:31:04.942 --> 00:31:07.183]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWurst.com reporting.

[00:33:21.343 --> 00:33:25.268]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:25.769 --> 00:33:27.291]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:31.897 --> 00:33:35.662]  And let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:33:35.682 --> 00:33:37.024]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:33:47.159 --> 00:33:47.899]  But I would add this.
[00:33:47.979 --> 00:33:51.040]  Let's dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:52.901]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:33:53.201 --> 00:33:53.321]  Fact.
[00:33:53.361 --> 00:33:54.141]  Here's the bottom line.
[00:33:54.341 --> 00:33:57.222]  This notion that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing is just not true.
[00:33:57.242 --> 00:33:57.562]  There it is.
[00:33:57.802 --> 00:33:59.083]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:33:59.103 --> 00:33:59.443]  There it is.
[00:33:59.483 --> 00:34:00.783]  The memorized 25 second speech.
[00:34:00.823 --> 00:34:03.524]  That's the reason why this campaign is so important.
[00:34:03.544 --> 00:34:04.724]  To the gang of eight, Bill, first.
[00:34:04.784 --> 00:34:05.965]  Well, here's the response.
[00:34:06.185 --> 00:34:12.667]  I think anyone who believes that Barack Obama isn't doing what he's doing on purpose doesn't understand what we're dealing with here.
[00:34:12.687 --> 00:34:12.807]  Okay?
[00:34:12.847 --> 00:34:13.727]  This is a president.
[00:34:13.987 --> 00:34:16.108]  This is a president who is trying to change this country.
[00:34:21.323 --> 00:34:25.507]  Find out more about the robotic politicians that want to enslave you at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:30.612 --> 00:34:41.695]  There's Marco Rubio saying that Obama knows exactly what he's doing, contradicting himself from a few months ago in which he repeatedly said that he doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:34:42.276 --> 00:34:46.557]  And Marco Rubio has aligned behind Obama on several key policy issues.
[00:34:46.597 --> 00:34:50.058]  I described before the break arming the jihadist rebels.
[00:34:50.518 --> 00:34:56.320]  At every step of the way, Rubio was behind that policy that's led to the destruction of Syria.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.922]  And to the growth of ISIS.
[00:34:58.962 --> 00:35:15.863]  Of course, the Pentagon, in their own documents, foresaw the growth of a Salafist principality, in other words, ISIS, long before it happened, which is why they supported the jihadists in Libya and Syria in the first place, because they wanted to topple Bashar al-Assad.
[00:35:16.323 --> 00:35:20.087]  Marco Rubio has been behind that policy at every single step of the way.
[00:35:20.107 --> 00:35:24.951]  He's also been behind beefing, continuing NSA surveillance.
[00:35:24.991 --> 00:35:37.823]  Again, falsely claiming that more surveillance would have stopped the Paris Massacre when these people were coming in as refugees and once they got into Europe they were communicating with each other directly.
[00:35:38.502 --> 00:35:41.303]  So Rubio's been proven wrong again and again.
[00:35:41.903 --> 00:35:43.824]  Now we've got this article out of World Net Daily.
[00:35:44.724 --> 00:35:49.706]  Phyllis Schlafly pulls back bail on Rubio's open borders record.
[00:35:50.246 --> 00:36:03.070]  Senator Marco Rubio, already struggling to consolidate the support of the Republican establishment after a disastrous weekend presidential race debate performance, now has another obstacle in his quest for the party's nomination.
[00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:15.358]  Legendary conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly and her organization Eagle Forum have released a new report detailing what she called Rubio's long history of, quote, betraying conservatives.
[00:36:15.979 --> 00:36:21.863]  The memo details specific promises made by Rubio to conservative supporters when he was running for Senate.
[00:36:22.243 --> 00:36:26.526]  It also offers evidence of how he broke those vows once elected to the United States Senate.
[00:36:26.906 --> 00:36:32.330]  At the top of the list is, you guessed it, amnesty for illegal immigrants.
[00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:40.015]  So again, years ago he was posing as being against amnesty for the millions of illegal immigrants in the United States.
[00:36:40.455 --> 00:36:43.037]  Now he's behind the Gang of Eight Bill.
[00:36:43.377 --> 00:36:48.601]  And again, he's completely flip-flopped and he's aligned with the major planks of Obama's agenda.
[00:36:49.301 --> 00:37:00.251]  So for him to, you know, put himself up against Obama and try not to look like part of the establishment is really pathetic once you dig into Rubio's actual record.
[00:37:00.891 --> 00:37:10.360]  But according to Fox News, who released the results of the New Hampshire primary early on their website before scrubbing them, before taking it down when we pointed it out,
[00:37:11.468 --> 00:37:13.429]  Rubio's set to finish second.
[00:37:13.489 --> 00:37:17.731]  That would be a surprise for many, given his poor performance on Saturday night.
[00:37:18.291 --> 00:37:21.793]  And even Rubio himself doesn't appear too confident.
[00:37:21.813 --> 00:37:23.093]  This is out of the Daily Mail.
[00:37:23.733 --> 00:37:29.696]  Rubio dampens New Hampshire expectations as he says he could finish in second, third or fourth.
[00:37:30.256 --> 00:37:33.838]  And only the media is fixated on his robotic debate disaster.
[00:37:34.687 --> 00:37:46.114]  Marco Rubio downplayed his chances of strong finish in New Hampshire on the morning of the first in the nation primary election, saying he has no idea where he will finish and it could be in as low as fourth place.
[00:37:46.874 --> 00:37:51.017]  So again, very bizarre that he would come out with such negative statements.
[00:37:51.777 --> 00:37:54.699]  Maybe he's trying to reframe the result again.
[00:37:55.632 --> 00:37:59.613]  The discussion is all about who's coming second, who's coming third, who's coming fourth.
[00:38:00.133 --> 00:38:03.214]  It's not going to be about Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump.
[00:38:03.254 --> 00:38:16.758]  In fact, when those inevitable victories happen, they're going to try and diminish them by saying, for example, if Sanders doesn't beat Clinton by double digits, they're going to reframe that as a defeat for Bernie Sanders.
[00:38:17.458 --> 00:38:28.720]  If Donald Trump only wins by 12 percentage points or less, they're going to reframe that as we focused on yesterday with the Jeb Bush supporting GOP Mayor.
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:32.341]  They're going to reframe that as a defeat for Donald Trump.
[00:38:32.361 --> 00:38:38.422]  So it's all about massaging the perspective in the aftermath of these results as they come in.
[00:38:39.022 --> 00:38:40.222]  This is out the Telegraph.
[00:38:40.982 --> 00:38:45.943]  While Trump and Sanders smell victory, Hillary Clinton contemplates humiliation.
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:50.084]  What will be a good result for Hillary in her race against Bernie Sanders?
[00:38:50.224 --> 00:38:51.205]  I asked a Democrat.
[00:38:51.746 --> 00:38:55.391]  He replied, She'll be happy with second place.
[00:38:55.831 --> 00:38:58.514]  Of course, those are the only two running in that particular race.
[00:38:59.075 --> 00:39:04.041]  Today's New Hampshire primary will be all about the post-match rationalizations.
[00:39:04.662 --> 00:39:07.003]  We expect Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump to win.
[00:39:07.043 --> 00:39:08.323]  That's a foregone conclusion.
[00:39:08.803 --> 00:39:16.266]  But the political establishment, the pundits and the media, can't even contemplate the thought of a Sanders versus Trump race.
[00:39:16.906 --> 00:39:23.528]  So they'll put a wall around New Hampshire, say that it didn't really matter, and look ahead to the states to come.
[00:39:23.868 --> 00:39:29.350]  Ergo, who comes second and how close to first they come could dominate media interest.
[00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:33.031]  So that's what it's all going to be about with this New Hampshire primary.
[00:39:33.391 --> 00:39:48.138]  They're going to try and denigrate the victories of Trump and Sanders by pushing up these establishment candidates, even if, which it looks completely likely in the case of Sanders and Clinton, that Clinton trails him by double digits.
[00:39:48.638 --> 00:39:53.240]  So that's what we have to watch out for in the aftermath of this New Hampshire primary.
[00:39:54.031 --> 00:40:06.605]  Now of course we've got Richard Reeves who is on the ground in New Hampshire and he's just come out with this special report in which he talks to a Donald Trump campaign strategist on how Trump will make America great again.
[00:40:06.685 --> 00:40:07.306]  Here's the clip.
[00:40:08.942 --> 00:40:12.523]  Richard Reeves with Infowars.com at the Red Arrow Diner with Steve Miller.
[00:40:13.004 --> 00:40:14.604]  What's your position with the Trump campaign again?
[00:40:14.944 --> 00:40:16.305]  I'm the Senior Policy Advisor.
[00:40:17.025 --> 00:40:19.966]  So as Senior Policy Advisor, what are you really looking at?
[00:40:19.986 --> 00:40:21.407]  What are the top issues that you're working on?
[00:40:21.707 --> 00:40:23.708]  Well, two of the biggest ones are trade and immigration.
[00:40:24.048 --> 00:40:25.649]  And that's a lot of what this election comes down to.
[00:40:25.689 --> 00:40:34.452]  And of course, Alex Jones and Infowars have been on top of this for a long time, both on the Trans-Pacific Partnership and on the immigration issue and all the different facets of it.
[00:40:34.692 --> 00:40:36.313]  So it's really great to be talking to you today.
[00:40:36.873 --> 00:40:47.986]  But my short message for your audience would be that if you want to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, if you want to close the border, if you want to protect American jobs and wages, then you have to support Donald J. Trump.
[00:40:48.027 --> 00:40:54.174]  He's the only person who's been clear and consistent and firm on these issues and who isn't relying on large special interests and donors.
[00:40:54.894 --> 00:41:03.436]  Well, he clearly does appear to be the most serious candidate on that issue, and he's, uh, I'm convinced that he will actually get Mexico to even pay for the wall as well, right?
[00:41:03.656 --> 00:41:04.616]  There's no doubt that he will.
[00:41:04.897 --> 00:41:08.457]  He's a businessman, he knows how to get stuff done, and the reality is that we have all the leverage with Mexico.
[00:41:08.897 --> 00:41:15.639]  They send billions of dollars home every year in what are called remittances, right, which is that illegal immigrants make money here and they send it back home.
[00:41:15.679 --> 00:41:16.919]  Mexico's economy depends on it.
[00:41:17.299 --> 00:41:19.060]  Mexico's economy depends upon
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:23.864]  Us being outsourced, sending our jobs and factories to Mexico.
[00:41:23.884 --> 00:41:26.286]  They depend upon tourism for the United States.
[00:41:26.467 --> 00:41:31.271]  They depend upon the ability of their workers to cross our border and come to the United States.
[00:41:31.692 --> 00:41:32.392]  Every single day.
[00:41:32.933 --> 00:41:33.593]  By the thousands.
[00:41:33.613 --> 00:41:37.177]  So they have enormous dependency upon the United States.
[00:41:37.237 --> 00:41:39.139]  So we have all the leverage and we're not using it.
[00:41:39.159 --> 00:41:41.481]  So we can absolutely get them to pay for the border wall.
[00:41:41.941 --> 00:41:45.464]  Right, and then add to that the cost of American jobs.
[00:41:46.184 --> 00:41:49.426]  Americans don't get the jobs that they should for the pay that they should.
[00:41:49.647 --> 00:42:03.616]  Right, and so the flip side of this, of course, is that while Mexico is making all the money off of the outsourced jobs, making money off of the remittance payments from the illegal alien workers, making money off of the guest worker programs and everything else, American workers are losing out.
[00:42:04.097 --> 00:42:06.118]  And that's why we have seen no wage growth.
[00:42:06.178 --> 00:42:07.419]  In fact, we've seen wage declines.
[00:42:07.459 --> 00:42:10.101]  That's why we've seen huge numbers of people not working at all.
[00:42:10.141 --> 00:42:11.202]  Look at the construction industry.
[00:42:11.642 --> 00:42:15.765]  How many construction workers across America right now are unemployed or have given up on construction altogether?
[00:42:16.586 --> 00:42:24.271]  Our open border has betrayed American workers in many industries and construction of course is one of the hardest hit and Donald J. Trump is going to turn that around.
[00:42:24.291 --> 00:42:26.993]  Now you mentioned TPP a little while ago.
[00:42:27.333 --> 00:42:34.018]  Is Mr. Trump fully aware of the ramifications of the passage of TPP that it would actually pretty much wipe out U.S.
[00:42:34.058 --> 00:42:36.540]  sovereignty and open those floodgates to immigration?
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.303]  Yes, so that's one of the things that he's been clearest on.
[00:42:39.583 --> 00:42:46.532]  And again, if you look at the way we've had eight debates now, I think, and has anyone else in any of the debates besides Mr. Trump
[00:42:47.256 --> 00:42:48.097]  We're good to go.
[00:43:15.507 --> 00:43:23.151]  All right, well, now, what did you think about the debate last Saturday with the way the audience was kind of rigged in favor of the governors?
[00:43:23.171 --> 00:43:23.851]  What do you think about that?
[00:43:24.192 --> 00:43:28.914]  Well, I think it was, again, one of the reasons why people love Mr. Trump is that he tells the truth.
[00:43:29.374 --> 00:43:30.475]  He tells the truth.
[00:43:30.775 --> 00:43:42.621]  I'm sure all of us have watched these debates and wondered why sometimes the audiences seem to applaud for things that, you know, you would think that your typical blue-collar worker wouldn't applaud for, or to jeer things that you think your typical blue-collar worker
[00:43:42.921 --> 00:43:48.325]  Well, and it's a great thing he called out the audience because that was actually probably a winning moment in the debate right there.
[00:44:10.003 --> 00:44:12.286]  Right, because most Americans aren't large donors.
[00:44:12.686 --> 00:44:20.396]  That's the whole point, is Mr. Trump is appealing to, as he will in a general election, people who don't have large check accounts to write checks to politicians.
[00:44:20.416 --> 00:44:22.138]  He's appealing to people who go to work every day for a living.
[00:44:23.038 --> 00:44:34.583]  And the GOP, in my estimation, plans on, what they did to that debate, that's what they plan on doing in Cleveland in July, is stacking that delegation full of GOP hardline establishment folks.
[00:44:34.983 --> 00:44:46.048]  The easiest thing to do, if we want to have Donald J. Trump be our nominee, is to show up and vote tomorrow in New Hampshire, and then to vote in South Carolina, and all across this country, and that will,
[00:44:46.508 --> 00:44:55.651]  That will guarantee, I assure you, that Donald J. Trump will be the Republican nominee and millions and millions of people are joining this movement and is going to truly make America great again.
[00:44:56.432 --> 00:45:00.813]  And beyond that folks, get to your precinct conventions and precinct coxes because that's the road to Cleveland.
[00:45:01.333 --> 00:45:02.294]  Steve Miller, thank you so much.
[00:45:02.634 --> 00:45:03.454]  Thank you, great to be here.
[00:45:03.474 --> 00:45:11.157]  That's Richard Reeves live on the ground in New Hampshire talking to a Donald Trump campaign representative.
[00:45:11.826 --> 00:45:18.389]  And WorldNetDaily also has a story out today about Trump's comments that he made to Michael Savage in an interview yesterday.
[00:45:19.189 --> 00:45:20.150]  Trump to Savage?
[00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:23.031]  Maybe Obama doesn't want to defeat ISIS.
[00:45:23.091 --> 00:45:30.374]  In another wide-ranging interview with talk radio host Michael Savage, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump suggests that President Obama
[00:45:30.934 --> 00:45:34.636]  Why not have a desire to defeat the Islamic Jihadist group ISIS?
[00:45:35.076 --> 00:45:40.438]  The real estate billionaire shied away from declaring he would win the New Hampshire primary Tuesday.
[00:45:40.878 --> 00:45:50.763]  Trump repeated his observation that President Obama refuses to identify the enemy as radical Islamic terrorism, insisting ISIS and other groups have nothing to do with Islam.
[00:45:51.343 --> 00:45:55.185]  Well, of course, we've seen Obama come up with this kind of statement again and again.
[00:45:55.846 --> 00:46:04.471]  We've seen him even refer to the Christian Crusades to try and absolve Islam of blame when it comes to radical jihadist terror.
[00:46:05.111 --> 00:46:06.712]  And now Trump's pointing that out.
[00:46:07.372 --> 00:46:10.794]  He told Savage, quote, maybe he doesn't want to get rid of the problem.
[00:46:11.615 --> 00:46:13.616]  I don't know exactly what's going on.
[00:46:14.517 --> 00:46:26.250]  Well of course we know, but from back in November we report on the fact that the White House, the Obama White House, was giving ISIS a 45 minute warning before bombing its oil tankers.
[00:46:27.301 --> 00:46:35.324]  They had the opportunity to bomb these oil tankers for 15 months during the conflict in Syria, completely failed to do so.
[00:46:35.845 --> 00:46:46.609]  Of course, then Russia came along and destroyed more than 1,000 tankers in just five days, after the US had destroyed none over a period of 15 months.
[00:46:47.029 --> 00:46:53.052]  The rationalization, of course, was that they didn't want to create an environmental catastrophe.
[00:46:53.877 --> 00:46:57.759]  And again, it goes back to this Pentagon document that I've talked about again and again.
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:46:59.961]  They foresaw the rise of ISIS.
[00:47:00.081 --> 00:47:08.005]  They saw that as a positive development because it would achieve their wider objective of destabilizing Bashar al-Assad.
[00:47:08.045 --> 00:47:11.407]  They foresaw the rise of a Salafist principality.
[00:47:11.828 --> 00:47:13.008]  In other words, ISIS.
[00:47:13.889 --> 00:47:16.130]  So for 15 months they basically did nothing.
[00:47:16.811 --> 00:47:18.552]  ISIS spread throughout the region.
[00:47:19.012 --> 00:47:20.313]  Then Russia comes along
[00:47:21.437 --> 00:47:27.602]  Again, drops thousands and thousands of pounds of bombs and destroys 1,000 oil tankers in just five days.
[00:47:27.682 --> 00:47:28.983]  Now ISIS is on the run.
[00:47:29.423 --> 00:47:30.704]  They're losing territory.
[00:47:31.165 --> 00:47:37.590]  The FSA rebels, many of whom are aligned with ISIS in Aleppo, are about to lose that territory.
[00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:44.936]  The media's framing it as some massive defeat that these jihadist rebels who like to cut people's hearts out on camera and eat them
[00:47:45.848 --> 00:47:51.173]  That that's somehow a bad thing that they're going to be wiped out of the region, so we see that narrative continuing.
[00:47:52.134 --> 00:47:58.240]  But Trump's right in identifying the fact that Obama's complete inaction on fighting ISIS for so long
[00:47:59.361 --> 00:48:10.149]  Actually giving the people who drive their oil tankers 45 minutes warning is a key element in suggesting that maybe he didn't want to rid them from the region.
[00:48:10.849 --> 00:48:14.412]  So now those comments to Michael Savage are especially interesting.
[00:48:15.232 --> 00:48:22.277]  Jane Fonda's come out, this is from Breitbart, and said that Trump's racism is turning young Muslims into terrorists.
[00:48:22.297 --> 00:48:27.181]  That's right, it's not the Quran that directs young Muslims to kill the non-believers.
[00:48:28.021 --> 00:48:29.522]  It's all Donald Trump's fault.
[00:48:30.262 --> 00:48:40.288]  Actress and feminist activist Jane Fonda, who of course has said nothing whatsoever about the migrant rape scandal that's sweeping Europe, putting thousands of young women at risk.
[00:48:40.628 --> 00:48:43.009]  You know, an actual feminist course, not a word on it.
[00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:49.393]  Jane Fonda has accused Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump of driving young Muslims to participate in terrorism.
[00:48:49.893 --> 00:48:56.657]  Speaking at the Women's Equality and ERA Coalition's Night of Comedy, quite appropriate, in New York City yesterday,
[00:48:57.037 --> 00:49:01.779]  The 78-year-old accused Trump of fanning the flames of people's anxieties and racism.
[00:49:02.259 --> 00:49:07.982]  It's terrible and dangerous, Fonda said of Trump's candidacy two days ahead of the New Hampshire primary.
[00:49:08.911 --> 00:49:19.214]  So because Trump offered this proposal to temporarily limit Muslim immigration into the United States, he's to blame for the future terrorist attacks.
[00:49:19.795 --> 00:49:21.335]  Where have we heard this before?
[00:49:21.695 --> 00:49:36.360]  We heard it after Charlie Hebdo, where the regressive left blamed the cartoonists for provoking the special snowflake Muslims and offending their feelings, basically blaming them for their own slaughter.
[00:49:37.355 --> 00:49:39.896]  We saw it again in the aftermath of Garland, Texas.
[00:49:40.276 --> 00:49:41.837]  And we're going to see it over and over again.
[00:49:42.537 --> 00:50:03.406]  Which is why now we've got police agencies in Europe covering up many of these incidents involving migrant crimes and acts of terror so as not to disrupt this narrative that it's all based in grievance and it's the racist, offensive rhetoric of the right that's causing these Muslims to act out.
[00:50:03.586 --> 00:50:05.627]  Because otherwise they'd be completely peaceful.
[00:50:06.047 --> 00:50:06.267]  Right?
[00:50:06.287 --> 00:50:15.435]  Because it's not as if they throw gays off buildings, stone women to death, kill people who leave the faith of Islam, when there's no external influence whatsoever.
[00:50:15.695 --> 00:50:23.341]  You can't blame that on US foreign policy or Donald Trump's comments when it's enshrined into their system of law.
[00:50:24.081 --> 00:50:27.644]  When it's enshrined in the Quran, the directives that they follow.
[00:50:28.205 --> 00:50:30.266]  That cannot be blamed on Donald Trump.
[00:50:31.187 --> 00:50:33.389]  But this migrant situation is escalating.
[00:50:33.689 --> 00:50:39.914]  And again, every single day, more reports of rapes, more reports of assaults, more stabbings.
[00:50:40.595 --> 00:50:49.482]  And now we've got a Norwegian police chief who is warning that mass immigration could threaten civil unrest and mass disorder across Europe.
[00:50:49.862 --> 00:50:52.704]  She's not the first one to say that by no means.
[00:50:53.144 --> 00:50:55.366]  And we're going to get into it more after the break.
[00:50:55.426 --> 00:50:57.068]  Also going to take your calls.

[00:52:12.945 --> 00:52:13.465]  It's true.

[00:55:57.512 --> 00:56:02.634]  Now this is a story we've been tracking for a while and we've got another top story about it up on InfoWars.com.
[00:56:03.115 --> 00:56:07.176]  Norwegian police chief warns mass immigration threatens civil unrest.
[00:56:07.437 --> 00:56:12.139]  Influx of Muslim asylum seekers will have, quote, unfortunate consequences.
[00:56:12.559 --> 00:56:19.042]  And we've seen a lot of those unfortunate consequences so far with this mass rape scandal sweeping Europe.
[00:56:19.542 --> 00:56:37.889]  But the head of Norway's Police Security Service warns that the importation of large numbers of migrants who fail to assimilate into Western society – that's right, defecating in swimming pools is not a form of assimilation – could spark civil unrest and a groundswell of right-wing extremism.
[00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:40.210]  And this is the point I've made again and again.
[00:56:41.192 --> 00:56:48.616]  When the regressive left stands down and aligns with Islamists, that only creates a vacuum.
[00:56:49.157 --> 00:56:53.099]  Because so-called liberals aren't standing up for liberal principles.
[00:56:53.599 --> 00:56:54.720]  So what does that create?
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:59.103]  A vacuum for actual neo-Nazis and extremists to fill the void.
[00:56:59.443 --> 00:57:06.187]  Which is why you see so many of these attacks now occurring on the streets of Europe, where it's extremists attacking migrants.
[00:57:06.807 --> 00:57:08.528]  Many of whom will be innocent people.
[00:57:09.169 --> 00:57:10.109]  That's not on us.
[00:57:10.229 --> 00:57:15.013]  That's on the regressive left for failing to stand up for liberal principles.
[00:57:15.413 --> 00:57:17.514]  It's created that backlash.
[00:57:18.075 --> 00:57:23.979]  Censoring people who make critical comments about their government's migration policy on Facebook and Twitter.
[00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:32.195]  Giving them police home visits, as happened in the Netherlands, that's going to create an increased backlash.
[00:57:32.755 --> 00:57:40.941]  They know that, which is why top security experts are now warning about it, including Benedikt Bjørland, who is the head of Norway's SSP.
[00:57:41.901 --> 00:57:52.035]  During a security and defense conference in Sweden said that the recent surge in asylum seekers from Muslim countries could have unfortunate consequences, including violent clashes.
[00:57:52.135 --> 00:57:59.145]  Quote, one cannot take for granted that new population groups automatically adapt to the norms and regulations in Norwegian society.
[00:58:00.649 --> 00:58:06.271]  New populations are not homogeneous, and they can bring their ethnic or religious differences from their homeland.
[00:58:06.891 --> 00:58:19.035]  And that's exactly what we've seen, especially in Sweden and Norway, with people being attacked, raped on the streets, and the police organizations there ordered to cover it up.
[00:58:19.455 --> 00:58:22.517]  So as not to legitimize critics of mass immigration.
[00:58:23.078 --> 00:58:27.721]  These warnings have also been sent out by German security experts.
[00:58:27.881 --> 00:58:28.681]  Angela Merkel.
[00:58:28.941 --> 00:58:31.243]  They've been sent out by French security experts.
[00:58:31.623 --> 00:58:37.007]  We've now got the French army preparing for immigrant uprisings in these Muslim ghettos.
[00:58:37.647 --> 00:58:40.389]  And they're preparing to take back national territory.
[00:58:40.849 --> 00:58:43.091]  This is the mass civil unrest that's coming to Europe.
[00:58:43.391 --> 00:58:44.332]  We're going to get some more of this.
[00:58:44.552 --> 00:58:48.915]  And to your calls after the break, this is the Alex Jones Show live from ThoughtWars.com.

[00:59:29.526 --> 00:59:34.573]  Super Mill Vitality from InfoWarsLife.com has sold out multiple times in the last three months.

[00:59:52.537 --> 00:59:58.559]  I'm Alex Jones for Super Mel Vitality and InfoWarsLife.com, and I salute you, our supporters!
[01:00:01.693 --> 01:00:04.434]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:12.418 --> 01:00:15.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:17.501 --> 01:00:23.924]  Second hour of the Alex Jones Show live.
[01:00:23.944 --> 01:00:26.285]  We've got Tommy Robinson coming up in the third hour.
[01:00:26.345 --> 01:00:28.786]  We're going to go to your calls here in the next segment.
[01:00:28.806 --> 01:00:30.367]  We've got Aaron, Charles and Jesse.
[01:00:31.147 --> 01:00:32.448]  Please call in at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:32.508 --> 01:00:35.669]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:39.251]  We're talking about the New Hampshire primary.
[01:00:39.391 --> 01:00:45.014]  We're talking about the Muslim migrant crisis and basically any other issue that you want to bring up.
[01:00:45.574 --> 01:00:58.240]  Before the break I was talking about the head of Norway's police security service who basically says that these Muslim migrants aren't going to assimilate into Western society and it's going to create civil unrest and mass disorder.
[01:00:59.181 --> 01:01:12.612]  Now these comments are similar in nature to those made by the Norwegian Army Chief, Odin Johansson, who recently remarked that Europe must be prepared to fight to defend its values against the threat posed by radical Islam.
[01:01:13.013 --> 01:01:14.014]  Those were his words.
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:23.927]  Also, the Swedish Army General Anders Brandström has ordered his troops to prepare for a war in Europe against skilled opponents within a few years.
[01:01:24.487 --> 01:01:36.896]  We also had the Swiss Army Chief, André Blattmann, warning that the risk of social unrest in Europe was intensifying, and he came out and said citizens should arm themselves, which is exactly what people
[01:01:37.837 --> 01:01:39.979]  in Germany and Austria are trying to do.
[01:01:40.059 --> 01:01:45.704]  They're buying up supplies of pepper spray, non-lethal weapons, whatever they can get their hands on.
[01:01:46.265 --> 01:02:03.220]  Meanwhile, police in other European countries, like Norway, are releasing videos saying that women should just use the force to repel potential rapists, as if some kind of invisible energy field can make a determined rapist back away.
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:09.104]  Again, no call for them to use any kind of self-defense or weaponry whatsoever.
[01:02:09.424 --> 01:02:16.969]  We had the mayor in Cologne saying, oh, just keep potential rapists at arm's length, because that's really going to deter them, isn't it?
[01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:28.598]  And before the break I was talking about the regressive left failing once again to stand up for actual liberal principles, leaving a vacuum that is being filled by extremists.
[01:02:29.301 --> 01:02:31.441]  Now we have this story out of France 24.
[01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:33.762]  All too predictable once again.
[01:02:34.262 --> 01:02:37.623]  Swedish police arrest 14 for planning asylum center attack.
[01:02:38.323 --> 01:02:47.704]  Swedish police said Tuesday they had arrested 14 men for allegedly planning to attack an asylum center after finding axes, knives and iron pipes in their cars.
[01:02:48.665 --> 01:02:51.425]  The suspects were all carrying foreign ID papers.
[01:02:52.245 --> 01:02:56.386]  Adding some of them were Polish nationals living and working in Sweden.
[01:02:57.256 --> 01:03:03.258]  Now Poland, even if you speak to people from Poland, will admit that that's a very racist country.
[01:03:03.318 --> 01:03:07.299]  They actually, you know, throw bananas at black football players and things like that.
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:12.821]  These extremists are now, the ones that are living in Sweden, are now planning attacks on asylum centres.
[01:03:12.861 --> 01:03:17.943]  Because again, this whole narrative has bolstered the extreme right.
[01:03:18.863 --> 01:03:21.585]  Because censorship only creates more problems.
[01:03:21.605 --> 01:03:33.753]  You have the Stasi in Germany, actual former members of the Stasi, working with the German government, working with Facebook, to censor, quote, hate speech about migrants online.
[01:03:34.253 --> 01:03:40.337]  You actually dig in to what they characterize as hate speech and, for example, it's somebody who said they thought
[01:03:41.258 --> 01:03:45.740]  Their government's policy on refugees was, quote, a bad plan.
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:50.122]  That's supposedly hateful rhetoric, according to the authorities.
[01:03:50.642 --> 01:03:52.463]  And in that case, he got a home visit.
[01:03:53.203 --> 01:04:05.009]  So you're only going to create a bigger backlash if you tamp down and censor on legitimate criticism of this issue, which is why we're seeing more and more attacks.
[01:04:05.751 --> 01:04:13.052]  Meanwhile, over in Germany, Breitbart is reporting, Islamic State commander found living as refugee in rural German village.
[01:04:14.273 --> 01:04:24.914]  In the latest of a series of raids, German police have searched two homes in a rural village after a television channel interviewed a suspected Islamic State commander living there as a refugee.
[01:04:24.934 --> 01:04:26.995]  This is in the small town of St.
[01:04:27.055 --> 01:04:32.976]  Johann, southwest Germany, and basically, they found an ISIS commander living there.
[01:04:33.456 --> 01:04:36.079]  Not even in a major city, just in a small village.
[01:04:36.599 --> 01:04:45.447]  Remember the Paris Massacre terrorists bragged about how they abused and exploited the refugee program to enter into Europe.
[01:04:46.068 --> 01:04:52.273]  We've also had refugees found in German migrant camps that are admitted members of ISIS.
[01:04:52.734 --> 01:04:53.855]  We have hundreds of
[01:04:54.495 --> 01:05:00.422]  Migrants coming into Italy found with beheadings on their cell phones and pictures of ISIS flags.
[01:05:00.442 --> 01:05:02.524]  So, this continues to intensify.
[01:05:02.564 --> 01:05:03.845]  We'll get more into it after the break.
[01:05:04.246 --> 01:05:07.009]  And your calls on the Alex Jones Show don't go away.
[01:05:09.429 --> 01:05:25.480]  If polls are to be believed, Hillary Clinton's once commanding national lead over Bernie Sanders appears to have evaporated in a matter of days, pointing to trouble ahead for the former Secretary of State as voters cast their ballots Tuesday in Sanders-friendly New Hampshire, reports Fox News.
[01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:34.946]  A recent Reuters poll shows Clinton leading Sanders 48 to 45, while state polls are far better indicators going into each individual primary.
[01:05:35.106 --> 01:05:37.927]  National polls help gauge the candidate's broader appeal.
[01:05:38.147 --> 01:05:49.269]  Over the past several months, Clinton has at times led the national polls by more than 30 points, contributing to her front-runner label, even as she has faced tough races in Iowa and New Hampshire.
[01:05:49.509 --> 01:06:00.672]  But Sanders may be heading for a big win in New Hampshire Tuesday night, if he can hold off Clinton, who has gotten tougher on the Vermont senator in recent days, as her husband Bill Clinton ratchets up his attacks.
[01:06:01.293 --> 01:06:03.778]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com
[01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:12.250]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:06:12.571 --> 01:06:20.576]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:06:20.796 --> 01:06:25.840]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:28.522]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:04.571]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:35.576 --> 01:08:42.504]  I'll be 42 coming up in about 48 hours.
[01:08:43.606 --> 01:08:45.047]  Again, I want to thank everybody for joining us.
[01:08:45.208 --> 01:08:48.572]  I am reaching you via phone right now.
[01:08:49.192 --> 01:08:52.817]  I'm just a data plan on my cell phone and my Skype has gone complex for so long.
[01:08:53.644 --> 01:08:57.048]  But we have a very, very important three hours spanning out before us.
[01:08:57.088 --> 01:09:03.454]  We've already obviously done one hour here with Paul Joseph Watson, hosting from our Britannic Majesties London, England.
[01:09:03.474 --> 01:09:09.321]  And then of course, going into the fourth hour today, we have another one of the great crew that's going to be hosting as well.
[01:09:09.701 --> 01:09:17.109]  We're going to be cruising here today at about 35,000 feet, and we should be able to actually get into this eugenics command base.
[01:09:18.009 --> 01:09:20.410]  I'm sitting here looking at these newspapers in front of me.
[01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:21.510]  I'm sitting here looking at Infowars.com.
[01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:23.850]  I'm sitting here thinking about the whole compendium
[01:09:46.152 --> 01:09:58.303]  Of what's happening in our world, and I don't get into the whole esoteric, or into the fundamentals for that matter, or into the hidden for no reason.
[01:09:58.323 --> 01:10:00.505]  I don't do it out of lack of material.
[01:10:01.365 --> 01:10:05.629]  We have an abundance of information to cover here that's new and breaking, and we will this hour.
[01:10:07.511 --> 01:10:13.116]  But when I sit back and I think about the illusion that the elite are involved in,
[01:10:14.167 --> 01:10:22.014]  That you can screw over your fellow humans, mid-term or long-term, and get away with it and not have it come back on you.
[01:10:22.354 --> 01:10:40.810]  That that sense of justice, that that sense of community, that that sense of being together on Spaceship Earth and this great experience, that the establishment not only is against that, but the system has set up a religion of hating humanity.
[01:10:42.139 --> 01:10:46.962]  And I know I've talked about this a lot, but it really, really hit me last night, today.
[01:10:48.623 --> 01:11:00.891]  When we talk about cottontail rabbits, a European species of diminutive rabbit, we don't talk about male rabbits and female rabbits.
[01:11:01.371 --> 01:11:06.254]  We don't talk about, oh, those males, boy, they sure are hateful and abusive.
[01:11:06.394 --> 01:11:07.555]  Sometimes they kick the female.
[01:11:08.448 --> 01:11:10.410]  And we don't talk about it as female rabbits.
[01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:13.312]  We don't talk about rabbits as baby rabbits.
[01:11:14.292 --> 01:11:17.875]  We talk about rabbits as rabbits as a species.
[01:11:18.896 --> 01:11:22.118]  Now, humans are a little bit different than rabbits.
[01:11:23.519 --> 01:11:25.200]  We build giant, complex cities.
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.221]  We build spaceships.
[01:11:26.261 --> 01:11:29.183]  We build computers that are probably already sentient.
[01:11:30.264 --> 01:11:32.325]  We build biological weapons.
[01:11:32.365 --> 01:11:34.247]  We paint incredible pieces of art.
[01:11:35.268 --> 01:11:54.538]  And it's in that celebration of the human experience and realizing just how special we are that we do find our transcendence because it's along that path of believing in the nobler savage that we come out of the dark ages into the new development of humanity that God has planned for us all.
[01:11:56.339 --> 01:12:02.783]  But then I think about the establishment, the social engineers, the people that know the secrets of humanity, the people that
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:19.727]  That know the secrets to a great extent of the universe, compared to the general public, and to know that they have those keys, Solomon's keys, if you would, that's what they are, and that they would not give those to the people, is the ultimate sin.
[01:12:19.767 --> 01:12:26.009]  And their argument is, oh well, we don't give it to the public because they're profane.
[01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:30.851]  They're not enlightened, they're not proven, they're not higher order enough.
[01:12:32.112 --> 01:12:32.672]  No, it's...
[01:12:33.715 --> 01:12:34.316]  It's a fraud.
[01:12:34.396 --> 01:12:35.817]  That's one of the greatest lies right there.
[01:12:36.537 --> 01:12:45.944]  To use the allegory of Arthur Pendragon, and the sword in the stone, and Merlin, the lice.
[01:12:47.125 --> 01:12:51.788]  The sword was always there for any to try to pull it from the stone.
[01:12:55.131 --> 01:12:55.631]  Think about that.
[01:12:56.773 --> 01:13:04.216]  So, the globalists claim you can't understand the esoteric knowledge if you're not one of them, and therefore the public's been kept from the knowledge.
[01:13:04.356 --> 01:13:11.599]  But the truth is, the stone does not sit on the rock, on the edge of town in the woods, on a hill.
[01:13:13.159 --> 01:13:14.340]  They hide the sword.
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.820]  They bury the sword.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.942]  They put thousands and thousands of tons of rubble on top of the sword.
[01:13:22.683 --> 01:13:25.824]  They persecute, attack anyone that ever says there was a sword.
[01:13:26.863 --> 01:13:27.744]  But there was a rock.
[01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:31.646]  They don't want you to be able to try for the sword.
[01:13:32.687 --> 01:13:35.589]  Because they are unworthy of the sword.
[01:13:36.490 --> 01:13:37.951]  They tried to pull the sword.
[01:13:38.071 --> 01:13:39.652]  They know there's a sword.
[01:13:40.132 --> 01:13:41.133]  But they're not enlightened.
[01:13:42.174 --> 01:13:42.974]  They're not empowered.
[01:13:42.994 --> 01:13:44.615]  They couldn't pull it.
[01:13:46.777 --> 01:13:49.119]  And so they tell you they pulled the sword.
[01:13:49.339 --> 01:13:51.020]  They tell you they've got a secret.
[01:13:53.416 --> 01:13:57.558]  But they tell you you're profane and fallen and so you can't try for it.
[01:13:57.778 --> 01:14:00.900]  And the truth is they themselves are not worthy.
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:09.405]  And so they want to end the contest there and end the development and the transcendence of humanity because they themselves are fallen.
[01:14:09.765 --> 01:14:12.126]  And in that is the secret of the devil's mind.
[01:14:15.228 --> 01:14:21.251]  You stare into the spirit of this world and it only seeks to keep us from going to the next level.
[01:14:24.474 --> 01:14:43.332]  And the engineers stand back knowing basic building blocks of humanity and keeping it from the public and using culture and media to turn the population into the most servile, rat-like, mindless, gibbering hordes of foaming, frothing zombies.
[01:14:45.245 --> 01:14:50.946]  And they look at us with their diseased eyes, the engineers, and say, look how low you are.
[01:14:51.427 --> 01:14:53.007]  Look how far you've fallen.
[01:14:53.367 --> 01:14:55.108]  Look at how pathetic you are.
[01:14:57.088 --> 01:14:59.049]  But you know who's even lower than those zombies?
[01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:01.569]  Are the magicians.
[01:15:02.969 --> 01:15:06.850]  And the kings of the earth, the sorcerers, the trafficked at men's souls.
[01:15:08.911 --> 01:15:12.592]  Who would try to bring a people, a race,
[01:15:13.482 --> 01:15:16.423]  Down that low so they could play God.
[01:15:16.443 --> 01:15:17.424]  And that's key.
[01:15:17.964 --> 01:15:18.945]  Play God.
[01:15:20.065 --> 01:15:21.626]  You were no God at all.
[01:15:22.907 --> 01:15:26.648]  You couldn't even comprehend the idea of a real God.
[01:15:28.549 --> 01:15:30.911]  And that's why everything that comes out of you is ugliness.
[01:15:32.291 --> 01:15:41.916]  A system with our ingenuity and our technology and our developments and everything given to us by the Creator to build what we are destined to create.
[01:15:43.613 --> 01:15:45.516]  So far, it's all Bishop and Child's play.
[01:15:47.278 --> 01:16:01.354]  They build this world using our minds, our art, our souls, and then tell us that they were the authors of it, again, because they could not pull the sword from the stone.
[01:16:01.654 --> 01:16:03.597]  And the truth is, the sword's already gone.
[01:16:04.511 --> 01:16:14.834]  Because humanity, from the age of fire and the wheel, right through to Jesus Christ himself and on, already pulled Excalibur from that rock.
[01:16:15.795 --> 01:16:18.635]  We already have Excalibur in our hands.
[01:16:19.556 --> 01:16:21.336]  And that's why the enemy hates our guts.
[01:16:21.776 --> 01:16:27.518]  Because they tried to bury it, they tried to obscure it, they tried to lie about it, they tried to say it never existed!
[01:16:28.258 --> 01:16:30.099]  They tried to put us in the age of children.
[01:16:31.647 --> 01:16:39.330]  Denying that there is subterfuge, denying that there is secrets, denying that there is good and evil, denying that there is free will.
[01:16:39.730 --> 01:16:57.717]  You go pay $100,000 to send your child to an average four-year education, or $200,000 or $300,000 to an Ivy League education, and all they're taught is how to hate themselves, and how to be cynical, and how they have no free will, and no soul, and no destiny, and how they can hate other people below them.
[01:16:58.497 --> 01:17:01.218]  They're being taught the opposite of what it is to be strong.
[01:17:01.718 --> 01:17:03.499]  The opposite of what it is to be enlightened.
[01:17:03.979 --> 01:17:08.441]  The opposite of what it is to truly be a creature made in God's image.
[01:17:09.681 --> 01:17:13.042]  And these enemies realize that their age is coming to an end.
[01:17:14.203 --> 01:17:17.644]  Their fall foretold is upon us.
[01:17:18.544 --> 01:17:22.165]  The next decade is the seminal test.
[01:17:22.986 --> 01:17:26.947]  And through this crucible of fire, we will
[01:17:27.998 --> 01:17:29.539]  As a species, go to the next level.
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:31.161]  And yes, we see the tricks.
[01:17:31.221 --> 01:17:32.082]  We see the frauds.
[01:17:32.362 --> 01:17:38.327]  We see the public rejecting Marco Rubio and Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush.
[01:17:38.627 --> 01:17:40.949]  Rejecting it desperately with a Bernie Sanders.
[01:17:41.009 --> 01:17:42.871]  Rejecting it desperately with a Donald Trump.
[01:17:43.131 --> 01:17:47.775]  Whether they're good or bad, they represent a desperate struggle.
[01:17:48.676 --> 01:17:49.997]  And it's only the beginning.
[01:17:51.218 --> 01:17:55.742]  And the public believes because we see one more con game, one more fraud.
[01:17:56.804 --> 01:17:57.665]  We're good to go.
[01:18:27.853 --> 01:18:29.734]  And that's why the globalists have a problem.
[01:18:30.595 --> 01:18:36.018]  Because they claim that they have the depth, they can fill the cup until it runs over when they are empty.
[01:18:37.439 --> 01:18:49.887]  All they can do is like vampires feed on us and redistribute our wealth, our minds, our souls, our creativity, and then claim that they themselves deployed it.
[01:18:51.468 --> 01:18:52.229]  A great example,
[01:18:53.115 --> 01:18:58.198]  We had a computer programmer, consultant for a few years that came into the workforce, and he was from Venezuela.
[01:18:58.218 --> 01:19:00.459]  His name was Max.
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.301]  And he said, listen, I have family in Venezuela.
[01:19:03.781 --> 01:19:06.643]  They had a private school for decades, but it was taken over by the government.
[01:19:06.963 --> 01:19:08.564]  They still work there, basically.
[01:19:09.104 --> 01:19:11.526]  Or they could just go out and live in the street, but they're basically paid nothing.
[01:19:12.686 --> 01:19:18.770]  And he said, I believed it, but years later, just a few years ago, it was actually in the news.
[01:19:19.972 --> 01:19:22.873]  It was actually caught on video, caught, you know, they put it in newspapers there.
[01:19:22.893 --> 01:19:26.035]  They actually pray to Chavez now as a saint in the schools.
[01:19:26.235 --> 01:19:29.056]  Now these dead say, Chavez, give us milk, give us cereal.
[01:19:29.296 --> 01:19:34.398]  So the poor kids come into the school, and there's milk and cereal distributed by the government.
[01:19:35.199 --> 01:19:37.100]  And they first say, pray to Jesus.
[01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:41.181]  And the children close their eyes and pray to Jesus, and they're hungry.
[01:19:41.602 --> 01:19:42.202]  There's no food.
[01:19:42.722 --> 01:19:43.382]  And then there's no food.
[01:19:43.402 --> 01:19:46.444]  And they say, now pray to Hugo Chavez, and pray to the Socialists.
[01:19:47.124 --> 01:19:49.365]  And when they open their eyes, there is milk.
[01:19:50.453 --> 01:19:51.214]  And there is cereal.
[01:19:52.095 --> 01:19:54.738]  The truth is, Hugo Chavez didn't produce that milk, it's cereal.
[01:19:55.038 --> 01:19:57.761]  People working hard in the fields produced it.
[01:19:57.981 --> 01:19:59.243]  And that's who these parasites are.
[01:19:59.283 --> 01:20:01.886]  They want us to think they produced the bounty.
[01:20:02.587 --> 01:20:05.089]  When they're nothing but parasites redistributing the wealth.
[01:20:05.129 --> 01:20:07.532]  We'll be back with Paul Watson and a lot more on New Hampshire.
[01:20:07.732 --> 01:20:08.353]  Stay with us, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:20:09.764 --> 01:20:20.354]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?

[01:20:52.475 --> 01:20:54.295]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[01:20:54.536 --> 01:20:57.637]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[01:20:57.657 --> 01:20:59.799]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[01:24:28.748 --> 01:24:31.090]  We ought to actually play this song coming in the next segment.
[01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:35.674]  John Harmon, if you could find it, because thanks to the Renegades, we're free today.
[01:24:36.194 --> 01:24:44.902]  I'm just sitting here looking at the headlines that are on Infowars.com, that are on DrugsReport.com, and just look at these headlines.
[01:24:45.752 --> 01:24:47.852]  Obama's newest executive order.
[01:24:48.933 --> 01:24:50.153]  What's killing U.S.
[01:24:50.213 --> 01:24:51.353]  life expectancy?
[01:24:52.113 --> 01:24:56.014]  Top intelligence official, ISIS likely to attempt U.S.
[01:24:56.094 --> 01:24:57.134]  attacks this year.
[01:24:58.055 --> 01:25:01.715]  Clinton supporters rile young women.
[01:25:02.936 --> 01:25:05.316]  Obama's last budget aims to vex.
[01:25:06.957 --> 01:25:08.637]  And it just goes on and on.
[01:25:10.484 --> 01:25:10.944]  Look at this.
[01:25:11.445 --> 01:25:12.906]  What's killing U.S.
[01:25:13.026 --> 01:25:14.528]  life expectancy?
[01:25:14.988 --> 01:25:18.071]  Oh, and they've got a bunch of excuses and the rest of it.
[01:25:18.531 --> 01:25:24.316]  Here's the biggest news anybody out there really who cares about their own life, their own family's life should know.
[01:25:25.697 --> 01:25:29.381]  And I've said this many times, but I've looked at the actuaries, I've looked at the demographics.
[01:25:29.401 --> 01:25:30.481]  Anybody can look this up.
[01:25:31.803 --> 01:25:33.244]  Until indoor plumbing.
[01:25:34.708 --> 01:25:45.952]  And until people began to wash their clothes and learn to wash their hands with disinfectants and things, the number one cause of death, period, was infectious disease.
[01:25:46.672 --> 01:25:49.373]  Vaccines had nothing to do with bringing those numbers down.
[01:25:49.433 --> 01:25:50.374]  It was indoor plumbing.
[01:25:50.434 --> 01:25:53.155]  And even mainline historians admit that.
[01:25:54.075 --> 01:25:56.816]  But if you go to a cemetery,
[01:25:57.620 --> 01:26:00.442]  And we've got a family cemetery on our ranch.
[01:26:00.723 --> 01:26:04.066]  We've had since before, before Texas was Texas, East Texas.
[01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:09.830]  It's full of Johnsons and Joneses and Browns, all my ancestors on my dad's side.
[01:26:09.850 --> 01:26:17.277]  And out there, about 40% of the gravestones are for people under the age of 10.
[01:26:18.650 --> 01:26:22.152]  And of that 40% or so, I think I want to make a documentary or do a piece on it.
[01:26:22.172 --> 01:26:23.312]  Sometimes I'll show that old graveyard.
[01:26:23.332 --> 01:26:24.413]  There's hundreds of tombstones.
[01:26:24.433 --> 01:26:26.114]  A lot of them, trees have fallen over.
[01:26:26.134 --> 01:26:27.134]  You can't read some of them.
[01:26:28.515 --> 01:26:30.156]  Some of them say killed by Indians.
[01:26:30.496 --> 01:26:31.256]  It's pretty wild.
[01:26:31.916 --> 01:26:41.121]  But you look at those tombstones and of the 40% or so that are under the age of 10, most of those, the vast majority, are below the age of 3.
[01:26:42.492 --> 01:26:48.535]  There's little angels carved in the stone, and sweet little Betsy, sweet little Jessie, went home to Jesus.
[01:26:49.775 --> 01:26:58.199]  And the truth is, is that someone in the 1820s, if they lived past the age of 10, lived longer than we do today.
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:06.043]  The issue is they calculate infant mortality, where around a third of the children or more died.
[01:27:07.828 --> 01:27:10.690]  They count infant mortality in and say, oh, we're living longer.
[01:27:10.730 --> 01:27:17.773]  But even with those jack numbers, infant mortality suddenly, that did go way down, has gone way up.
[01:27:19.274 --> 01:27:20.615]  And so has all the other charts.
[01:27:20.655 --> 01:27:23.136]  So they've got ways to keep us alive and get our money out of us.
[01:27:24.699 --> 01:27:26.860]  But they're suppressing the real treatments.
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:29.220]  I wouldn't call them cures, but a lot of border on that.
[01:27:29.681 --> 01:27:33.502]  A cure fixes it every time, but they've got treatments that are like 95% effective.
[01:27:34.482 --> 01:27:36.383]  And they do everything they can to shut those down, folks.
[01:27:36.963 --> 01:27:41.384]  The elite get clean vaccines, they get real surgeries, they get real treatment.
[01:27:41.984 --> 01:27:44.345]  But you know, Paul, we're going to cover more of what's happening in New Hampshire.
[01:27:45.211 --> 01:27:50.875]  On the situation with Russia and the economy in the next segment, but you've been listening to me for 20 minutes here, ranting about the state of the world.
[01:27:51.376 --> 01:28:09.849]  Do you not agree with me that the political and cultural will of Excalibur to stand up against tyranny and to truly promote an economy based on exploration, innovation, and trailblazing human ingenuity will trump, pun intended, the parasitic systems of crony capitalism?
[01:28:12.233 --> 01:28:29.101]  Well, I have that hope, Alex, but I mean, the problem we've got... I mean, I saw a comment earlier today which was, you know, if extraterrestrials invaded Earth, many on the regressive left would help them conquer humanity, because there's such this rampant hatred for humanity.
[01:28:29.301 --> 01:28:30.242]  Oh, I totally agree.
[01:28:30.282 --> 01:28:36.905]  If aliens showed up and said it's for the Earth, the average leftist would throw their child on a garbage disposal and literally kiss the butt of the green alien.
[01:28:37.844 --> 01:28:44.968]  Yeah, if they said, for the good of the Earth, we need to put certain people in camps and do this and that, then they would go along with it.
[01:28:44.988 --> 01:28:58.696]  I mean, I'm watching a video of somebody who was viciously beaten up by four migrants, this professor in the UK, and he's gone and confronted Tommy Robinson on his opposition to Islamisation throughout Europe.
[01:28:59.156 --> 01:29:03.698]  You know, we've got people, volunteers, being raped by these migrants in Canada.
[01:29:03.778 --> 01:29:09.441]  And listen, I know you're going to cover that in the next hour, and I'm glad you are, Paul, but listen, this is it.
[01:29:09.481 --> 01:29:14.323]  I'm not claiming I'm the toughest guy around, and then Mr. Badass, and neither are you, but you grew up in a rough area.
[01:29:14.664 --> 01:29:18.745]  You know, your parents in the cutlery business, you know, blue collar in Sheffield.
[01:29:18.765 --> 01:29:23.688]  So I've talked to you, I heard you when you were like 18 years old, so I know you've been through a lot of rough stuff.
[01:29:24.657 --> 01:29:35.621]  Legitimate suffering and not being on the street and not living in the real world, these soft yuppies are the ones that love death, love tyranny, love re-education camps, because they've never been around it.
[01:29:36.521 --> 01:29:39.882]  So that veneer will peel away very quickly as things collapse, but yes.
[01:29:40.162 --> 01:29:43.103]  Have you noticed how soft all these would-be authoritarians are?
[01:29:43.123 --> 01:29:47.385]  Have you noticed how un-un-unweathered they are, how they've never been around, Paul?
[01:29:48.578 --> 01:29:51.199]  Yeah, I mean, they turn up in dresses to rallies.
[01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:52.079]  It's insane.
[01:29:52.279 --> 01:29:58.461]  Yeah, well, if they want to start a physical war, which we're trying to stop, well, they'll get a war from us, and then they'll find out.
[01:29:58.581 --> 01:29:59.481]  We're on the march.
[01:29:59.981 --> 01:30:01.582]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.502 --> 01:30:05.183]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.252 --> 01:30:18.255]  The FBI formally confirmed that its investigation, connected to Hillary Clinton's private email server, remains ongoing in a letter released Monday, reports The Hill.
[01:30:18.415 --> 01:30:23.557]  The message does not offer any new details about the probe, which the Bureau has been reluctant to discuss.
[01:30:23.717 --> 01:30:29.999]  However, it represents the FBI's formal notification to the State Department that it is investigating the issue.
[01:30:30.259 --> 01:30:39.610]  The letter was sent on February 2nd, but released on Monday as part of an ongoing lawsuit related to the disclosure of Clinton's emails from conservative watchdog Judicial Watch.
[01:30:40.010 --> 01:30:48.560]  FBI Director James Comey has previously referenced the FBI probe, which the bureau had previously declined to confirm or deny in court filings last year.
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:49.621]  I want more candy!
[01:30:49.641 --> 01:30:50.381]  I want more video games!
[01:30:50.401 --> 01:30:50.561]  Mine!
[01:30:50.601 --> 01:30:50.881]  Mine!
[01:30:50.901 --> 01:30:51.062]  Mine!
[01:31:12.296 --> 01:31:21.684]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:31:22.045 --> 01:31:24.607]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:31:24.747 --> 01:31:28.110]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:31:28.290 --> 01:31:34.335]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:31:34.636 --> 01:31:39.440]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:45.923]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:31:46.123 --> 01:31:53.606]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:31:53.866 --> 01:32:01.149]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:32:08.812 --> 01:32:12.035]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:32:12.335 --> 01:32:20.361]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:32:20.582 --> 01:32:25.606]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:33:22.990 --> 01:33:32.739]  From Nazareth he came with a ragtag band to bring a revolution.
[01:33:35.222 --> 01:33:40.547]  Some would make him king, others couldn't stand for that.
[01:33:42.168 --> 01:33:44.671]  The cross was a solution.
[01:33:48.928 --> 01:33:50.448]  And wise men follow him.
[01:33:50.508 --> 01:33:51.849]  Wise men follow him?
[01:33:52.569 --> 01:33:57.470]  I remember playing this song like 20 years ago when it first came out.
[01:33:57.550 --> 01:34:02.751]  In fact, ask one of the crew.
[01:34:02.811 --> 01:34:06.912]  John Harmon, who is this author?
[01:34:06.992 --> 01:34:09.933]  Who is this musician?
[01:34:10.233 --> 01:34:11.593]  Turn it back up.
[01:34:17.915 --> 01:34:20.316]  Renegades are mine.
[01:34:20.336 --> 01:34:24.417]  That's right, it's Steve Voss.
[01:34:29.958 --> 01:34:31.179]  They railed against the crown.
[01:34:31.859 --> 01:34:38.021]  And they laid their bodies down.
[01:34:46.534 --> 01:34:48.095]  In a bloody war.
[01:34:48.115 --> 01:34:49.036]  For liberty.
[01:34:49.116 --> 01:34:51.918]  For their descendants.
[01:34:51.998 --> 01:34:54.059]  Everything is because of them today.
[01:35:12.751 --> 01:35:14.993]  America has the greatest renegades in history.
[01:35:15.073 --> 01:35:17.075]  No one denies it.
[01:35:17.736 --> 01:35:19.217]  People that were far ahead of their time.
[01:35:19.477 --> 01:35:24.762]  Without the renegades, Lord knows where we'd be.
[01:35:24.942 --> 01:35:27.965]  Because this future belongs to them.
[01:35:27.985 --> 01:35:29.206]  They were the heroes.
[01:35:29.346 --> 01:35:31.768]  When it comes to heroes, renegades are mine.
[01:36:09.119 --> 01:36:17.125]  You, the listeners of InfoWars, in this whole world, the enemy knows you, and God knows you as well.
[01:36:17.965 --> 01:36:20.967]  You are the Renegades.
[01:36:21.028 --> 01:36:25.691]  Without you, Lord knows where we'll be.
[01:36:25.731 --> 01:36:29.013]  When it comes to heroes, Renegades are mine.
[01:36:29.073 --> 01:36:30.134]  Renegades are mine.
[01:36:32.175 --> 01:36:34.917]  Think about that double meaning.
[01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:43.750]  When it comes to heroes, Renegades are mine.
[01:36:46.151 --> 01:36:46.791]  Steve Voss.
[01:36:46.811 --> 01:36:49.012]  I'm going to play more of that.
[01:36:49.032 --> 01:36:50.112]  I can't believe I can't remember his name.
[01:36:50.132 --> 01:36:51.513]  When I say play that song, what a great guy.
[01:36:51.533 --> 01:36:52.653]  We've had him on several times.
[01:36:52.713 --> 01:36:53.374]  Great patriot.
[01:36:54.774 --> 01:36:56.054]  But I'm teleprompter free, folks.
[01:36:56.074 --> 01:36:57.735]  So if my memory fails, I'll just ask the crew.
[01:36:58.435 --> 01:36:59.236]  But you think about that.
[01:36:59.276 --> 01:37:08.499]  When it comes to Renegades, when it comes to Renegades in the world today, who are the Renegades?
[01:37:09.324 --> 01:37:11.586]  When it comes to heroes, renegades are mine.
[01:37:12.847 --> 01:37:18.571]  Well, that means we're together across race and time and space.
[01:37:19.191 --> 01:37:21.974]  Whether you're listening to this in 20 years, you're listening to this today live.
[01:37:23.315 --> 01:37:24.856]  You want humanity to succeed.
[01:37:25.496 --> 01:37:26.577]  You believe in humanity.
[01:37:27.818 --> 01:37:30.880]  And you know humanity is a force for good when good people take action.
[01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:35.784]  And you know that the evil has taken over and told us that we're bad, so we'll stand down and let them enslave us.
[01:37:37.242 --> 01:37:38.322]  So that's what it comes down to.
[01:37:38.663 --> 01:37:40.123]  Hey, I know there's a bunch of evil scum.
[01:37:40.863 --> 01:37:57.830]  And I'll tell you something, when I see some anti-human person, when I see some trendy pulling up in a brand new Jaguar, and I've seen this, or a brand new Mercedes wearing a mousy-tongued, hammered sickle, I don't care if I'm with my kids or who I'm with, and believe me, I don't want trouble, I don't want to get in their face, but you know what?
[01:37:58.430 --> 01:38:05.233]  That symbol flew above the murder of 200-plus million people murdered last century, and millions this century.
[01:38:06.224 --> 01:38:12.967]  I get in their face and I say, excuse me, you realize that symbol, you have a right to wear that symbol, but only because you're in a free country.
[01:38:12.987 --> 01:38:19.249]  That's a symbol of pure death and evil, and killed five times what the Nazis did, and I want you to know I am deeply offended.
[01:38:19.989 --> 01:38:21.470]  And you know what their smart butts always say?
[01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:24.591]  They say, hey man, free speech, what are you censoring me?
[01:38:25.151 --> 01:38:28.433]  It isn't censorship for me to tell you, you're a pile of crap.
[01:38:31.134 --> 01:38:34.515]  And when they open a Mao Zedong bar in London or in Denver,
[01:38:36.656 --> 01:38:37.757]  You need to go out and boycott it.
[01:38:37.997 --> 01:38:39.478]  People say, oh, how will that save the world?
[01:38:39.659 --> 01:38:49.326]  What I mean is, when you recognize evil naked in your face, basically, you know what-ing in your face, you have got to get in its face.
[01:38:51.188 --> 01:38:52.329]  This happens to me every once in a while.
[01:38:52.369 --> 01:38:56.192]  It doesn't happen very often, but I'll have some liberal, socialist, trendy, communist.
[01:38:56.212 --> 01:38:57.533]  I'm in South by Southwest.
[01:38:57.553 --> 01:38:58.654]  It's going on in Austin or something.
[01:38:58.674 --> 01:38:59.415]  I'll be in a restaurant.
[01:38:59.915 --> 01:39:02.858]  And they'll walk over and go, boo, boo, boo, or tip my drink over.
[01:39:02.878 --> 01:39:04.379]  And I go, hey, have a seat.
[01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:06.269]  You think it intimidates me?
[01:39:06.289 --> 01:39:09.050]  You're saying, boo, like I care what a crowd of people think about me?
[01:39:09.370 --> 01:39:10.670]  You think I'm that shallow?
[01:39:10.690 --> 01:39:17.572]  One time I was visiting a friend in his condo, I was in his hot tub, and this guy walks over and he goes, this girl, he goes, I used to be a big listener.
[01:39:17.872 --> 01:39:18.552]  Of course he wasn't.
[01:39:19.153 --> 01:39:21.573]  Until I was with a con, you were, oh, oh, oh, laughing.
[01:39:21.593 --> 01:39:22.593]  He kept doing it for like two minutes.
[01:39:22.653 --> 01:39:25.674]  I said, dude, I left junior high a long time ago.
[01:39:26.294 --> 01:39:30.095]  You think you standing above me laughing at me means anything to me?
[01:39:30.115 --> 01:39:32.516]  I have an inner compass, punk.
[01:39:34.973 --> 01:39:43.675]  And I want to explain to you that I'm calling you a punk, not because I want to make you feel bad, but because you need to know you are a punk.
[01:39:44.755 --> 01:39:50.357]  You're a piece of cowardly filth that thinks that I care what you think about me.
[01:39:51.917 --> 01:39:52.797]  You know who I care about?
[01:39:52.817 --> 01:39:54.258]  I care about what God thinks about me.
[01:39:55.438 --> 01:39:59.919]  And I'm not going to sit here for you or anybody else and sell out my values or what I stand for.
[01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:06.242]  Nothing will make me bow to you, and it's certainly not giggling at me.
[01:40:06.442 --> 01:40:09.403]  That's the best humor I've heard in my life.
[01:40:09.683 --> 01:40:13.145]  But when you realize their mindset, you understand that's who these people are.
[01:40:13.385 --> 01:40:14.645]  Empty nothings.
[01:40:15.045 --> 01:40:21.828]  They have nothing inside, so they look at what's reflected back at them as if that maintains what's inside of them.
[01:40:21.868 --> 01:40:28.330]  They have no idea the roots those of us that love God have into the earth, into God, into everything, into our ancestors.
[01:40:29.031 --> 01:40:29.991]  I was thinking about it yesterday.
[01:40:31.286 --> 01:40:36.407]  It's like watching dolphins ride up a bow of a big shipping container ship coming in.
[01:40:36.667 --> 01:40:44.909]  There'll be five, six, seven, eight dolphins jumping and glee, jumping, riding that wake, riding that ship going 20 knots.
[01:40:45.929 --> 01:40:46.650]  They're caught in it.
[01:40:46.690 --> 01:40:47.330]  They love it.
[01:40:47.370 --> 01:40:48.070]  It's so fun.
[01:40:48.090 --> 01:40:52.691]  And I can just see, collectively, the archetype of all of our ancestors.
[01:40:53.667 --> 01:40:55.628]  Jumping and leaping in that wake with us.
[01:40:56.288 --> 01:40:59.509]  We're still alive now, but they're all right a millisecond behind us.
[01:40:59.989 --> 01:41:01.329]  Willing us on to succeed.
[01:41:01.469 --> 01:41:03.470]  Willing us on to create.
[01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:04.910]  Willing us on to be strong.
[01:41:06.771 --> 01:41:07.531]  Think about that.
[01:41:07.711 --> 01:41:08.251]  You have that.
[01:41:08.271 --> 01:41:15.814]  The enemy will fall in your heart the minute, the minute you realize all those great people that did incredible stuff for us.
[01:41:16.854 --> 01:41:17.454]  They failed.
[01:41:17.494 --> 01:41:18.154]  They succeeded.
[01:41:18.194 --> 01:41:18.755]  They were bad.
[01:41:18.775 --> 01:41:19.335]  They were good.
[01:41:19.375 --> 01:41:19.995]  They were beautiful.
[01:41:20.035 --> 01:41:20.675]  They were ugly.
[01:41:21.095 --> 01:41:21.816]  They were hateful.
[01:41:21.856 --> 01:41:22.396]  They were love.
[01:41:22.436 --> 01:41:23.136]  They were everything.
[01:41:24.116 --> 01:41:25.677]  The good, the bad, and the ugly, but they were real.
[01:41:25.697 --> 01:41:29.478]  It doesn't matter how much high-tech computer crap that they've got.
[01:41:29.498 --> 01:41:31.599]  It doesn't matter how much brainwashing the enemy's got.
[01:41:31.899 --> 01:41:39.442]  Let me tell you, the real trump card, the ace of spades in this fight, is our humanity and our destiny and our collective soul and will that God has created.
[01:41:39.462 --> 01:41:41.463]  He's so powerful.
[01:41:41.483 --> 01:41:42.763]  I don't mean to start preaching here today.
[01:41:42.803 --> 01:41:45.804]  It's just the enemy is attacking humanity at every front.
[01:41:46.985 --> 01:41:50.326]  And you know how beautiful and special and strong you are at every level.
[01:41:51.050 --> 01:41:53.593]  And don't feel guilty because you have knowledge of evil.
[01:41:54.254 --> 01:42:00.100]  From the time of Adam and Eve, we weren't stupid, we weren't mindless, we weren't dumb, we weren't even innocent.
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:01.822]  We just didn't have dark logic.
[01:42:02.665 --> 01:42:03.665]  We didn't have scams.
[01:42:03.705 --> 01:42:04.746]  We didn't have con games.
[01:42:05.046 --> 01:42:08.227]  We didn't need to know about con games to be able to avoid them.
[01:42:08.847 --> 01:42:13.289]  Knowing of a con, knowing of how evil thinks, is the beginning of actually being it.
[01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:15.070]  It's being in the mind of it.
[01:42:15.710 --> 01:42:22.672]  So when you have the knowledge of good and evil, it's that you're not evil, but you have been within evil to understand it because you've been brought up in it.
[01:42:23.012 --> 01:42:24.033]  And so it doesn't matter.
[01:42:24.073 --> 01:42:26.714]  Your pure nature has been destroyed.
[01:42:26.754 --> 01:42:27.394]  It has fallen.
[01:42:28.795 --> 01:42:35.981]  But, in a part of our mind, we are low, but in another part, we can transcend our fallen selves through Christ.
[01:42:38.984 --> 01:42:43.708]  And everything the world has done to us, and everything it's done to try to control us, and that's the true beauty.
[01:42:43.948 --> 01:42:47.731]  Now, I want to cover some news here and stop preaching, but I do preach here occasionally.
[01:42:47.791 --> 01:42:48.632]  I'm here on the telephone.
[01:42:48.652 --> 01:42:50.853]  Paul Watson is in the studio in London, England.
[01:42:51.094 --> 01:42:53.035]  We have the InfoWars News Center in Austin, Texas.
[01:42:53.075 --> 01:42:53.876]  We have Richard Reeves in
[01:42:56.058 --> 01:43:01.565]  New Hampshire, where most polls show Trump 15 to 20 points ahead, but God knows what they'll end up doing to him tonight.
[01:43:02.847 --> 01:43:05.631]  Whether he's real or good or bad doesn't matter.
[01:43:05.651 --> 01:43:08.014]  The fix clearly is in to push Rubio.
[01:43:08.515 --> 01:43:09.456]  So much is happening.
[01:43:09.496 --> 01:43:10.517]  Paul Watson's covering.
[01:43:11.258 --> 01:43:28.696]  The attempt to sacrifice the West, the attempt to butcher what is in it, the Renaissance, the art, the literature, the true liberalism of free open culture, with the wicked curved sword of ancient radical Islam, now being
[01:43:30.012 --> 01:43:32.753]  Launched against the Senate and people say it's so bold.
[01:43:32.833 --> 01:43:33.633]  It's so crazy.
[01:43:33.693 --> 01:43:35.033]  Why would they be so obvious?
[01:43:35.514 --> 01:43:36.934]  Why would they be so open?
[01:43:36.994 --> 01:43:38.034]  Why do they cover it up?
[01:43:38.134 --> 01:43:38.894]  Why do they hate us?
[01:43:39.455 --> 01:43:42.275]  They hate you because your ancestors were strong.
[01:43:43.436 --> 01:43:46.237]  And I don't care if you were a Comanche Native American.
[01:43:46.257 --> 01:43:51.398]  I don't care if you're from Latin America, China, Russia, Africa, whatever.
[01:43:51.858 --> 01:43:54.459]  In this world, there are good people and there are bad people.
[01:43:54.519 --> 01:43:55.179]  We have free will.
[01:43:56.136 --> 01:44:01.497]  The reason the elite are in the bloodlines is that family lines resonate towards good or they resonate towards evil.
[01:44:03.478 --> 01:44:08.679]  And the globalists are artificially trying to manipulate that to turn humanity towards wickedness right now.
[01:44:09.399 --> 01:44:19.942]  And that's why it's so important than ever that you realize you do have power, and we can affect change, and we can turn the world around, but you have to understand your native potential.
[01:44:22.230 --> 01:44:30.693]  Everything that Madison Avenue does, everything that TV and the culture controllers do is about making you feel small and ugly and bad.
[01:44:30.733 --> 01:44:34.774]  You are incredible on an incredible planet around incredible things.
[01:44:34.814 --> 01:44:36.374]  You can do so much amazing things.
[01:44:36.654 --> 01:44:51.139]  The fact that the human body can get out of bed in the morning, the fact that we can have children, the fact that we can see the beauty of a sunset, the fact that we can write music and literature and enjoy it and commune together every second is a moment of high magic.
[01:44:54.628 --> 01:44:55.348]  Break the enemy.
[01:44:56.249 --> 01:44:57.249]  Break the enemy's will.
[01:44:57.969 --> 01:44:58.870]  Break its enslavement.
[01:44:59.190 --> 01:45:00.310]  You don't need the world.
[01:45:00.611 --> 01:45:02.231]  You don't need it to authorize you.
[01:45:02.511 --> 01:45:03.912]  You don't need it to certify you.
[01:45:04.252 --> 01:45:06.453]  You don't need it to fulfill you.
[01:45:06.933 --> 01:45:07.813]  It needs you.
[01:45:12.015 --> 01:45:14.396]  You are life on this planet.
[01:45:14.416 --> 01:45:16.137]  You are the highest expression of that.
[01:45:17.415 --> 01:45:19.477]  And that's why the enemy is so scared right now.
[01:45:19.797 --> 01:45:27.084]  Paul Watson, I know I'm ranting here and getting a little bit esoteric, but comments on the esoteric, what do you think the secret of the universe is, Paul?
[01:45:27.465 --> 01:45:31.689]  Where do you think it's all going and what do you think, getting into politics and the news, we should cover next?
[01:45:33.769 --> 01:45:36.711]  Well, I mean, the secret to happiness is being a good person, Alex.
[01:45:36.751 --> 01:45:39.233]  You mentioned earlier the hipsters and the trendies.
[01:45:39.673 --> 01:45:44.897]  You know, looking like good people is more important to them than actually being good people.
[01:45:45.337 --> 01:45:47.239]  And they've done studies which prove this.
[01:45:47.759 --> 01:45:51.642]  Poorer conservatives are more generous than wealthier liberals.
[01:45:52.182 --> 01:45:55.665]  So, liberals, regressive leftists, they preach all day about how
[01:45:56.005 --> 01:45:56.785]  It's psychopaths with a
[01:46:24.913 --> 01:46:32.978]  Look, with a camouflage, I didn't know about the new study, but remember the Montreal study four years ago in England, the U.S., and Canada?
[01:46:32.998 --> 01:46:41.123]  A huge university study that found that liberals are six times more likely to steal and six times more likely to claim they've given a charity but not do it.
[01:46:41.523 --> 01:46:46.986]  And conservatives and Christians and libertarians, libertarians particularly, are the most giving groups there are.
[01:46:47.046 --> 01:46:47.967]  But this filth
[01:46:48.948 --> 01:46:49.188]  We're good.
[01:47:02.449 --> 01:47:06.451]  She says, why won't you expose Sharia law and the women and the millions sexually mutilated?
[01:47:06.751 --> 01:47:09.012]  She goes, how dare you, and changes the subject.
[01:47:09.233 --> 01:47:17.237]  She's a... Notice, she gives the exact canned talking point, because that filthy scum is working with the same globalists funding radical Islam.
[01:47:17.677 --> 01:47:19.758]  Can you believe it, what a pig she is?
[01:47:19.798 --> 01:47:20.979]  And folks, I do hate her, okay?
[01:47:21.159 --> 01:47:22.179]  She deserves to be hated.
[01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:23.340]  She's an enemy of women.
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:24.821]  She's an enemy of humanity.
[01:47:25.801 --> 01:47:27.642]  I'm sorry, Paul, but I'm sick of Gloria Steinem.
[01:47:27.662 --> 01:47:28.483]  I hate that pig!
[01:47:29.878 --> 01:47:37.760]  Well, she's in the tank for Hillary Clinton, who paid people, hired people to intimidate Bill Clinton's rape victims.
[01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:39.520]  I mean, is that feminism?
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:41.341]  Is that standing up for women's rights?
[01:47:41.841 --> 01:47:42.981]  It's completely disgusting.
[01:47:43.001 --> 01:47:48.343]  And she openly said, oh, you know, to Bill Maher, you're making me defend Islam.
[01:47:48.903 --> 01:47:52.744]  And she willingly did so, even as they're stoning women to death.
[01:47:52.784 --> 01:47:53.804]  And there's this idea that
[01:47:54.304 --> 01:48:03.427]  You know, that's just an extreme minority that are... There was a CNN article, I think was it yesterday, that they found 7 million more and 20-something million a decade more sexually mutilated?
[01:48:04.367 --> 01:48:07.568]  Yeah, female genital mutilation on a far bigger scale than ever imagined.
[01:48:07.588 --> 01:48:10.829]  Why are you weirdo liberal women lecturing us, you sacks of crap?
[01:48:12.250 --> 01:48:15.271]  I mean, why are women following these scumbag women?
[01:48:17.128 --> 01:48:32.271]  Well, it's partly Stockholm Syndrome and it's partly, you know, their whole stick relies on a constant supply of them being able to claim that we live in a patriarchy and a misogynistic society, which is why they have to stoop so low to invoke ridiculous things like...
[01:48:32.551 --> 01:48:43.296]  We sit here bitching in the middle of the New Atlantis, in the middle of the Renaissance, with everything at their feet, with the greatest men the world's ever seen, in our faces, telling us our trash, when our mothers loved us.
[01:48:43.316 --> 01:48:44.896]  This is an attack on the species.
[01:48:45.317 --> 01:48:47.958]  It's just that woman's an alien from a thousand light years away.
[01:48:48.018 --> 01:48:49.819]  She is an enemy of the species.
[01:48:49.859 --> 01:48:50.799]  There is no man.
[01:48:50.839 --> 01:48:51.619]  There is no woman.
[01:48:51.819 --> 01:48:52.820]  There is only humanity.
[01:48:54.122 --> 01:48:57.706]  The West is the greatest place ever to live for women, for minorities.
[01:48:57.786 --> 01:48:59.828]  It's the least racist place in the world.
[01:48:59.868 --> 01:49:04.372]  You know, I've got a friend of a friend who is like the daughter of some rich ambassadors.
[01:49:04.473 --> 01:49:05.574]  She's from Malaysia.
[01:49:06.114 --> 01:49:13.161]  She's a social justice warrior and a feminist, constantly whining about how racist and intolerant the West is.
[01:49:13.522 --> 01:49:14.683]  Her brother is gay!
[01:49:15.123 --> 01:49:17.104]  He can't go back to Malaysia.
[01:49:17.404 --> 01:49:18.244]  He lives in London.
[01:49:18.284 --> 01:49:22.706]  He can't go back to Malaysia because his family would discommunicate him.
[01:49:22.726 --> 01:49:29.229]  He could possibly be killed for being gay in that Muslim country, yet she's whining about how intolerant the West is.
[01:49:29.809 --> 01:49:32.470]  These are the kind of people that we face on a regular basis.
[01:49:32.871 --> 01:49:33.911]  Total hypocrite!
[01:49:35.071 --> 01:49:35.412]  Scum!
[01:49:35.512 --> 01:49:40.434]  I mean, they are the most intellectually dishonest, soft, stupid, fraudulent trash.
[01:49:40.974 --> 01:49:42.555]  And I am sick of them lecturing us.
[01:49:42.715 --> 01:49:43.475]  I'm sick of them.
[01:49:44.844 --> 01:49:51.266]  And they have to invent all these sacred cows to back that up, like rape culture, which doesn't exist in the West.
[01:49:51.306 --> 01:49:54.087]  Now we're importing one, they're blaming it on white German men.
[01:49:54.487 --> 01:50:02.149]  You know, ridiculous things like manspreading, all this made-up crap to try and impugn the West and white men in general.
[01:50:02.169 --> 01:50:07.331]  Banning mother and father, banning he and she, just give me a break, you people are scum.
[01:50:08.610 --> 01:50:08.990]  Exactly.
[01:50:09.010 --> 01:50:16.493]  And then Gloria Steinem stands up and says, oh, there are a lot of people in the Middle East that are standing up for feminism.
[01:50:16.533 --> 01:50:16.993]  No, no, no.
[01:50:17.013 --> 01:50:17.533]  She went further.
[01:50:17.733 --> 01:50:19.734]  She said Mohammed was the original feminist.
[01:50:20.274 --> 01:50:20.574]  Oh, yeah.
[01:50:20.834 --> 01:50:23.535]  She said he was a women's rights reformist.
[01:50:24.096 --> 01:50:26.216]  This is the guy who had like 200 sex slaves.
[01:50:26.276 --> 01:50:28.297]  Have we not heard enough from this enemy?
[01:50:28.317 --> 01:50:29.918]  This is an enemy!
[01:50:30.118 --> 01:50:30.318]  I mean...
[01:50:32.282 --> 01:50:33.283]  I mean these people are enemies!
[01:50:34.064 --> 01:50:39.609]  This is a woman who celebrates abortion with t-shirts and throws her hands up in the air and says how great it is.
[01:50:39.669 --> 01:50:41.391]  This is a wicked, wicked reason.
[01:50:41.411 --> 01:50:43.873]  Well why does she love radical Islam or Islam period?
[01:50:43.893 --> 01:50:44.794]  She's a lover of death!
[01:50:46.189 --> 01:50:46.609]  Exactly.
[01:50:46.629 --> 01:50:49.430]  And she's racist and it's a death thought.
[01:50:49.530 --> 01:50:50.450]  That's what she's into.
[01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:52.831]  I'm going to come back and finish up the turnover to you.
[01:50:52.911 --> 01:50:53.831]  I love you and the whole crew.
[01:50:53.851 --> 01:50:55.111]  Everybody's doing an amazing job.
[01:50:55.391 --> 01:50:56.332]  We need to be outraged.
[01:50:56.372 --> 01:50:56.932]  We need to be angry.
[01:50:56.952 --> 01:50:57.872]  We need to take action.
[01:50:57.892 --> 01:51:03.014]  We need to realize the enemy is the enemy and get in their face and say, listen, trash, we know who you are.
[01:51:03.074 --> 01:51:03.934]  We're coming for you.
[01:51:04.234 --> 01:51:05.134]  We're never backing off.
[01:51:05.174 --> 01:51:05.914]  We're never giving in.
[01:51:05.934 --> 01:51:06.755]  We're never submitting.
[01:51:07.195 --> 01:51:08.575]  We got our hands around your chicken.
[01:51:09.471 --> 01:51:12.212]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:51:12.533 --> 01:51:15.134]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:51:15.154 --> 01:51:15.574]  Croix River.
[01:51:15.894 --> 01:51:17.895]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:51:18.135 --> 01:51:20.857]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:51:21.097 --> 01:51:21.617]  His excuse?
[01:51:21.977 --> 01:51:23.038]  He simply couldn't afford it.

[01:53:38.982 --> 01:53:39.663]  We're good to go.
[01:54:19.728 --> 01:54:28.034]  David Bowie made the jump into hyperspace last month.
[01:54:28.074 --> 01:54:31.176]  The man who fell to Earth.
[01:54:31.216 --> 01:54:33.457]  We die in a lifetime.
[01:54:47.110 --> 01:55:02.463]  By the way, think about the fact that he has a gentleman on who founded a nationalist party, got out of it because racist groups got involved, who has literally been banned from demonstrating and going to speeches in the UK.
[01:55:03.685 --> 01:55:06.027]  We have them trying to ban Donald Trump from coming.
[01:55:06.047 --> 01:55:07.888]  They've already banned for, what, four years?
[01:55:08.589 --> 01:55:09.490]  Michael Savage.
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:17.042]  How is it liberal to say, because he criticizes radical Islam, he's banned, that that's who these people are?
[01:55:17.062 --> 01:55:18.643]  They're not liberals.
[01:55:18.683 --> 01:55:20.583]  They do not even deserve that.
[01:55:21.384 --> 01:55:27.446]  It's like, I don't criticize Rush Limbaugh, but he keeps calling environmentalists, from the time I was in high school, I didn't listen to Rush Limbaugh for 25 years.
[01:55:28.066 --> 01:55:30.447]  When I was a senior in high school, I started listening to him 25 years ago.
[01:55:32.245 --> 01:55:34.487]  Gosh, I can't believe it was 25 years ago, but it was.
[01:55:34.507 --> 01:55:39.413]  And he would go, these environmentalists, wackos, ha, ha, ha, and play chainsaw noises.
[01:55:39.693 --> 01:55:41.695]  They're not wackos, they run the show!
[01:55:41.915 --> 01:55:44.318]  Okay, let's say they're wackos, then wackos kicked our butt.
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:47.741]  They took over the country.
[01:55:49.023 --> 01:55:51.125]  And it's time to start being more honest about...
[01:55:52.225 --> 01:55:55.826]  What we're facing, what we're dealing with is a scientific, anti-human takeover.
[01:55:56.187 --> 01:56:02.229]  Putin came out last year and said, global carbon taxes and global warming is a fraud by select corporations.
[01:56:02.549 --> 01:56:08.011]  It's a military takeover of energy to shut down nation-states and individual companies and individuals.
[01:56:08.311 --> 01:56:09.431]  It is a tax on humanity.
[01:56:09.451 --> 01:56:11.612]  That's basically the full Putin speech.
[01:56:11.952 --> 01:56:12.473]  You can look it up.
[01:56:12.873 --> 01:56:14.613]  I've read it so many times on air, I haven't memorized it.
[01:56:15.234 --> 01:56:15.874]  Total truth!
[01:56:16.932 --> 01:56:17.933]  Now, is Putin good or bad?
[01:56:18.033 --> 01:56:18.433]  I don't know.
[01:56:18.494 --> 01:56:19.254]  That's total truth.
[01:56:19.875 --> 01:56:21.016]  A judge of three bites fruits.
[01:56:21.296 --> 01:56:22.357]  Who said that over and over again?
[01:56:22.377 --> 01:56:23.879]  It is a weaponized system.
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:29.424]  And you can't just choose to ignore it and choose to think everything's okay, folks.
[01:56:29.464 --> 01:56:30.365]  And I know you know that.
[01:56:30.405 --> 01:56:31.326]  I'm talking to new listeners.
[01:56:31.786 --> 01:56:33.508]  We're on almost 200 stations across the country.
[01:56:33.948 --> 01:56:34.869]  The show is exploding.
[01:56:35.850 --> 01:56:37.592]  And people need to know, this isn't a game.
[01:56:37.612 --> 01:56:39.974]  This is the real world, and separately.
[01:56:41.437 --> 01:56:59.426]  The power of We The People, spreading the word about this broadcast, other shows like it, telling friends and family, neighbors, supporting with your dollars, institutions, organizations, and systems that tell the truth, that's the last real power we have is word of mouth and the power of the purse, voting with our dollar.
[01:57:00.187 --> 01:57:08.511]  And we're running a special through tomorrow on the new AndroPlex that is designed to block the estrus of emigres, designed to make you feel more like a man naturally would,
[01:57:09.378 --> 01:57:13.643]  Doesn't mean it's as good as not having extra members in the environment, but it's the closest thing we can come up with.
[01:57:13.663 --> 01:57:14.263]  It's excellent.
[01:57:14.844 --> 01:57:15.985]  It supports the broadcast.
[01:57:16.025 --> 01:57:16.926]  Just give it a try.

[01:57:33.788 --> 01:57:50.495]  And Rachel Maddow and the Globalist pull their hair out that I don't care about being demonized, that I don't care about them wanting to kill me, that I don't care about being attacked, and that we'll even sit here and sell non-GMO seeds, and t-shirts, and books, and videos, and nutraceuticals.
[01:57:50.895 --> 01:57:52.436]  Oh my gosh, they hate it!
[01:57:52.456 --> 01:57:57.238]  How dare us in the free association sell products that finance our
[01:57:58.238 --> 01:58:02.999]  I mean, communists rob banks and run sex slave rings to fund themselves.
[01:58:03.039 --> 01:58:04.079]  We just sell products.
[01:58:04.099 --> 01:58:04.799]  How dirty!
[01:58:05.059 --> 01:58:06.100]  How unscrupulous!
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:07.320]  How horrible!
[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:16.842]  But you haven't bought into their anti-capitalist garbage, and you have yet again proven that if liberty takes the field, it cannot be defeated long term.
[01:58:17.162 --> 01:58:18.302]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:58:18.522 --> 01:58:20.722]  A bunch of other specials as well in tomorrow.
[01:58:21.043 --> 01:58:23.363]  Paul Watson, what's coming up in the next hour, my good friend?
[01:58:24.673 --> 01:58:33.759]  We're going to talk to Tommy Robinson, who of course just spearheaded the Pegida demonstrations in Birmingham in the UK, and obviously several other demonstrations throughout Europe.
[01:58:34.140 --> 01:58:41.925]  So we're going to get the latest on that, how he was censored by Al Jazeera for bringing up a certain sensitive topic, and lots more.
[01:58:41.965 --> 01:58:45.007]  We're going to try and take a couple of callers for Tommy as well, so that's coming up.
[01:58:45.528 --> 01:58:46.348]  Fantastic, Paul.
[01:58:46.368 --> 01:58:48.310]  It's been great knowing you for 14 years, my friend.
[01:58:48.350 --> 01:58:49.150]  Hopefully 14 more.
[01:58:49.170 --> 01:58:50.951]  Turning the transmission over to him, Paul.
[01:58:50.971 --> 01:58:51.472]  Two hours left.
[01:58:53.104 --> 01:58:55.386]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:56.006 --> 01:59:00.009]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:59:00.069 --> 01:59:00.490]  Good, brother.
[01:59:00.630 --> 01:59:02.331]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:59:02.371 --> 01:59:04.132]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:59:04.312 --> 01:59:08.335]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:59:08.355 --> 01:59:10.917]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:59:10.957 --> 01:59:13.179]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:59:13.379 --> 01:59:21.345]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:59:21.485 --> 01:59:24.647]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:59:24.787 --> 01:59:26.288]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:59:26.328 --> 01:59:30.730]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, saving a ton of money there.
[01:59:31.011 --> 01:59:36.814]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[01:59:37.034 --> 01:59:39.696]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:22.094 --> 02:00:29.621]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:00:30.602 --> 02:00:34.486]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:34.926 --> 02:00:38.770]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:00:39.130 --> 02:00:40.692]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:41.452 --> 02:00:50.960]  We are back on the Alex Jones Show, this live Tuesday, February 9th edition, and I'm delighted to be joined by a guest who's been on the show before.
[02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:54.864]  He's Tommy Robinson, obviously the founder of the EDL.
[02:00:54.884 --> 02:00:56.305]  He left that organization
[02:00:56.934 --> 02:01:04.640]  Now he's an avid speaker on the problems in the Western world with the rise of Islam, ISIS, hate speech and Sharia law.
[02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:11.766]  He's been liaising with the Pegida movement and he was involved in the protests this past weekend in Birmingham.
[02:01:12.286 --> 02:01:17.890]  Obviously other protests taking place throughout Europe against the Islamization of the West.
[02:01:17.950 --> 02:01:24.115]  His most recent book is Enemy of the State and his website is TommyRobinson.co.uk.
[02:01:24.175 --> 02:01:25.156]  Tommy, welcome to the show.
[02:01:28.134 --> 02:01:28.995]  We don't have Tommy yet.
[02:01:29.835 --> 02:01:36.881]  What I want to talk to Tommy about when we get him on the show is the fact that there's this clip that's just come out which is on his Twitter page.
[02:01:37.462 --> 02:01:45.328]  He's basically confronted by a liberal who was attacked by Muslim migrants quite recently.
[02:01:45.729 --> 02:01:50.292]  He attended this Pegida demonstration in Birmingham this past weekend.
[02:01:51.073 --> 02:01:53.295]  And obviously he tried to pull the same old trick.
[02:01:53.495 --> 02:02:00.940]  Oh, these beliefs, these violent acts, this rape culture is only believed by a tiny minority of Muslims.
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:11.447]  Well, if you look at the actual polls, attitudes of Muslims in the Middle East to Sharia law, to killing people who try to leave the faith of Islam,
[02:02:12.217 --> 02:02:16.359]  Two executing homosexuals, two stoning rape victims to death.
[02:02:16.859 --> 02:02:21.481]  The majority of those people in those countries support those beliefs.
[02:02:22.081 --> 02:02:24.182]  It's not a tiny minority.
[02:02:24.802 --> 02:02:28.204]  These are the general beliefs of Islam as contained in the Qur'an.
[02:02:28.844 --> 02:02:30.985]  And I've featured the video clip several times.
[02:02:32.005 --> 02:02:34.206]  There's a conference, it took place I believe in 2013, in Norway.
[02:02:36.627 --> 02:02:43.693]  At which a prominent Islamic speaker was addressing an audience of about two hundred, quote, moderate Muslims.
[02:02:44.794 --> 02:03:02.991]  Now the point he made was that these so-called extremist beliefs under the doctrine of Sharia law, killing people who leave the faith of Islam, executing homosexuals, stoning rape victims to death, female genital mutilation, these beliefs have been characterized by the media as only being
[02:03:03.857 --> 02:03:05.899]  believed by extremist Muslims.
[02:03:06.259 --> 02:03:08.300]  He wasn't happy with that definition.
[02:03:08.881 --> 02:03:13.905]  He said that these are common beliefs shared by all, quote, moderate Muslims.
[02:03:14.505 --> 02:03:25.674]  Then he canvassed the audience to see if they agreed that these, quote, extremist beliefs are actually the general beliefs of most mainstream Muslims.
[02:03:26.714 --> 02:03:32.079]  Almost every single person in that audience of 200 predominantly Muslim men
[02:03:32.799 --> 02:03:36.382]  In fact, almost entirely Muslim men raised their hand.
[02:03:36.782 --> 02:03:40.865]  They agreed that these beliefs are held by moderate Muslims.
[02:03:41.225 --> 02:03:44.348]  So no, it's not a tiny minority of extremists.
[02:03:44.808 --> 02:03:52.373]  This is a regressive 7th century belief system that's completely illiberal and is in need of reform.
[02:03:52.894 --> 02:04:01.040]  So why again and again do we see liberals not only failing to stand up against it, but openly embracing it?
[02:04:01.923 --> 02:04:15.834]  We saw in Cologne feminists handing out roses to Muslim migrants weeks, it's probably about two weeks, after the mass molestation of women in Cologne by Muslim migrants.
[02:04:16.594 --> 02:04:21.058]  So it's not enough, they don't simply just ignore it, they actually embrace it!
[02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:23.961]  They're embracing a rape culture!
[02:04:24.241 --> 02:04:38.209]  The top feminist group in Cologne came out the day after it was made public, after the media covered it up several days, and said, well, the real perpetrators in all this rape culture are white German men, because there are a handful of assaults
[02:04:39.099 --> 02:04:42.061]  At the, you know, annual Oktoberfest beer festival.
[02:04:42.101 --> 02:04:44.363]  So that means the problem is with white German men.
[02:04:45.004 --> 02:04:50.047]  Compare that to hundreds of hundreds of assaults in Cologne, Hamburg, Zurich.
[02:04:50.227 --> 02:04:51.548]  All these are the European cities.
[02:04:51.909 --> 02:04:55.531]  We're going to get into it with Tommy Robinson after the break.
[02:04:55.932 --> 02:04:58.153]  And we're going to take your calls for him as well.
[02:04:58.534 --> 02:04:59.875]  This is Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:04:59.935 --> 02:05:01.256]  It's the Alex Jones Show live.
[02:05:01.696 --> 02:05:03.337]  Infowars.com.
[02:05:03.377 --> 02:05:03.958]  Don't go away.
[02:05:09.218 --> 02:05:18.228]  The FBI formally confirmed that its investigation, connected to Hillary Clinton's private email server, remains ongoing in a letter released Monday, reports The Hill.
[02:05:18.389 --> 02:05:23.554]  The message does not offer any new details about the probe, which the Bureau has been reluctant to discuss.
[02:05:23.715 --> 02:05:29.982]  However, it represents the FBI's formal notification to the State Department that it is investigating the issue.
[02:05:30.242 --> 02:05:39.574]  The letter was sent on February 2nd, but released on Monday as part of an ongoing lawsuit related to the disclosure of Clinton's emails from conservative watchdog Judicial Watch.
[02:05:39.995 --> 02:05:48.546]  FBI Director James Comey has previously referenced the FBI probe, which the bureau had previously declined to confirm or deny in court filings last year.
[02:05:48.826 --> 02:05:49.106]  We're good.
[02:06:09.209 --> 02:06:09.649]  Hey, everyone!
[02:06:10.009 --> 02:06:12.270]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[02:06:12.290 --> 02:06:15.871]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[02:06:16.131 --> 02:06:17.732]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[02:06:18.232 --> 02:06:28.136]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[02:06:28.496 --> 02:06:34.478]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[02:06:34.938 --> 02:06:49.855]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[02:06:49.915 --> 02:06:50.476]  I think so.
[02:07:11.039 --> 02:07:14.422]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:07:14.762 --> 02:07:23.588]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war as the enemy approached, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:07:24.189 --> 02:07:31.034]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own.
[02:07:31.554 --> 02:07:32.575]  Air raid sirens.
[02:07:32.895 --> 02:07:36.996]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:07:37.256 --> 02:07:46.540]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:07:47.020 --> 02:07:52.384]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex, the latest product from Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:52.684 --> 02:07:58.668]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[02:07:58.988 --> 02:08:06.993]  And finally, for a limited time, when you buy the synergistic duo of Anthroplex and Super Metal Vitality together at Infowarslife.com, you'll get 15% off and free shipping.
[02:08:07.073 --> 02:08:08.014]  That's a limited time.
[02:08:25.578 --> 02:08:33.221]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:35.922 --> 02:08:38.703]  It's Paul Joseph Watson in for Alex Jones.
[02:08:38.923 --> 02:08:45.766]  As I mentioned before the break, we've got our guest, Tommy Robinson, who of course is liaising with the Pegida movement.
[02:08:45.806 --> 02:08:48.468]  They had a big march in Birmingham this past weekend.
[02:08:48.988 --> 02:08:54.110]  His new book is Enemy of the State, and you can get that at TommyRobinson.co.uk.
[02:08:54.150 --> 02:08:55.571]  Tommy, welcome back to the show.
[02:08:56.871 --> 02:08:57.451]  Having me back on?
[02:08:57.471 --> 02:08:59.873]  Do we have Tommy?
[02:08:59.913 --> 02:09:00.633]  I don't have his audio.
[02:09:02.571 --> 02:09:02.971]  Got me there?
[02:09:03.552 --> 02:09:04.432]  Yeah, I can hear you now.
[02:09:04.952 --> 02:09:11.116]  So, what I wanted to discuss first is, we've seen this alignment between Islamists and the left wing.
[02:09:11.156 --> 02:09:25.005]  Of course, a couple of weeks ago there was footage out of Calais, which showed these extreme left wing protesters not only helping them storm the ferry and try to get to Britain, but they were actually attacking Calais residents.
[02:09:25.672 --> 02:09:29.094]  In their own, on their own property, throwing bricks, etc.
[02:09:29.455 --> 02:09:34.018]  You know, chanting for these violent rampaging migrants throughout Cali.
[02:09:34.518 --> 02:09:37.380]  We've had these Pegida marches this past weekend.
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.261]  They showed up again.
[02:09:39.782 --> 02:09:46.506]  The media reported it as, you know, clashes between Pegida demonstrators and these left-wing activists.
[02:09:46.886 --> 02:09:49.048]  So tell us what actually happened in Birmingham.
[02:09:50.189 --> 02:09:53.010]  In Birmingham, we were quite fortunate with the way the police planned it.
[02:09:53.470 --> 02:09:56.991]  I was there the whole day, I didn't see any opposition to ourselves.
[02:09:57.291 --> 02:10:08.113]  There was a group of about 60 or 70 young anarchists, calling themselves Antifa, flying the flag of communism, which communism really is just like Islam without Allah.
[02:10:09.334 --> 02:10:11.474]  But what we did see in Europe, we saw attacks.
[02:10:11.754 --> 02:10:14.635]  When I went out to Copenhagen recently for a demonstration with Pegida,
[02:10:15.750 --> 02:10:24.935]  There was probably only about 200 of us, but as we walked through the city, from everywhere, there was such hatred coming at us from these young Antifa activists.
[02:10:25.535 --> 02:10:29.037]  And to myself, to the mindset I made, it didn't really bother me.
[02:10:29.057 --> 02:10:29.818]  It doesn't really bother me.
[02:10:29.878 --> 02:10:31.739]  One of them ran through the crowd and tried to punch me.
[02:10:32.299 --> 02:10:41.504]  But when I turned to one of the women, Anne-Marie Waters, who's a spokesman for, who's a deputy leader of Brigade UK, and I asked her what she thought of it all, she said she was terrified.
[02:10:42.224 --> 02:10:43.785]  Now, that's why they do it.
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:51.646]  They do it to crush and stamp down and silence and dismantle any opposition to the Islamisation of Europe.
[02:10:51.966 --> 02:10:59.812]  What we saw in Dublin at the weekend, we saw the Pegida didn't even get to have their demonstration because they'd come under violent attack.
[02:10:59.892 --> 02:11:01.593]  Their leader was hospitalised with a pole.
[02:11:03.194 --> 02:11:04.694]  So these are the tactics that they use.
[02:11:05.074 --> 02:11:08.735]  Because Burkina has got so big in Dresden, it's very hard for them to silence it in that city.
[02:11:09.215 --> 02:11:17.637]  But obviously, to the new movements popping up in Europe, their pure motive and their pure ambition is to silence them and destroy it before it gets the opportunity to get big enough.
[02:11:18.317 --> 02:11:21.618]  That's in Dublin, the footage there.
[02:11:22.178 --> 02:11:29.200]  So, they tried that very on with the English Defence League, but then the English Defence League, the problem you get when you have a clash like that,
[02:11:29.781 --> 02:11:38.364]  Was, once you come under attack, which Inglis Fensley did very early on, once you come under violent attack, there's only certain sorts of people that go back out on the streets.
[02:11:38.844 --> 02:11:45.226]  Now, you want to reach mainstream England, middle England, you can't have a hostility like that on a demonstration.
[02:11:45.848 --> 02:11:50.830]  So we chose specifically in the UK to basically march in the middle of nowhere.
[02:11:51.390 --> 02:12:01.713]  Unfortunately it's not safe and it's not free for us to walk through our city centres because we will get violently attacked but not just by far left activists but obviously every city centre in the UK is now occupied with Muslim youth.
[02:12:02.173 --> 02:12:03.773]  So we've come under violent attack.
[02:12:03.793 --> 02:12:10.575]  So we chose to demonstrate in the middle of nowhere and it was a success because the police managed to keep anyone, any opposition away from us.
[02:12:10.996 --> 02:12:13.436]  We managed to have our own peaceful silent walk.
[02:12:13.496 --> 02:12:14.737]  There was approximately about 600 of us
[02:12:15.977 --> 02:12:17.038]  Even though the media report 200.
[02:12:17.658 --> 02:12:27.062]  But, obviously, this was the first demonstration and a success for us was having a silent and peaceful rally to show people what we're about as an organisation.
[02:12:27.122 --> 02:12:32.005]  And we hope that Anna will join us on our next one in April.
[02:12:34.106 --> 02:12:37.007]  Now, I saw you tweeted probably about an hour ago now.
[02:12:37.622 --> 02:12:40.866]  There was a guy who Channel 4 said confronted you.
[02:12:41.307 --> 02:12:47.435]  This was a guy who had been violently attacked in his own home, I believe, by Muslim migrants.
[02:12:47.495 --> 02:12:52.141]  And he was basically repeating this point that we debunked over and over again.
[02:12:52.662 --> 02:12:57.844]  But these beliefs, these violent intolerant beliefs, are only held by a tiny minority.
[02:12:58.224 --> 02:13:15.171]  Now I was talking before the break about, you know, the footage at the conference in Norway where the guy is completely confused as to why the media is characterizing these extremist beliefs as extremist, this Muslim speaker, because they're beliefs widely held by most, quote, moderate Muslims.
[02:13:15.531 --> 02:13:18.092]  And they all raise their hand in the audience to agree with him.
[02:13:18.652 --> 02:13:23.296]  But we see, from the left, again, this alignment with Islamism.
[02:13:23.596 --> 02:13:34.025]  We had feminists in Cologne handing out roses to Muslim migrants at the biggest refugee centre there, just a couple of weeks after the mass molestation of women in Cologne.
[02:13:34.485 --> 02:13:34.886]  We've had
[02:13:35.939 --> 02:13:47.488]  Volunteers in migrant camps in Germany and Calais being raped and then their fellow left-wing agitators tell them not to talk about it because it might discredit their cause.
[02:13:47.828 --> 02:13:51.651]  And they call themselves feminists and they call themselves, you know, supporters of women's rights.
[02:13:52.152 --> 02:14:03.341]  So why are feminists and the left in general so, you know, beholden to defending Islam when we know it's the most repressive, intolerant belief system in existence?
[02:14:03.441 --> 02:14:04.982]  Why do they still hold to that?
[02:14:06.927 --> 02:14:08.088]  It's very easy to do that.
[02:14:08.528 --> 02:14:09.168]  It's very easy.
[02:14:09.188 --> 02:14:12.349]  There's no Christianism aimed at you for doing that.
[02:14:12.369 --> 02:14:21.453]  If you do what we do, and you tell the truth about Islam, and you... We're going to reconnect with Tommy because his audio was cutting out there.
[02:14:22.153 --> 02:14:26.755]  And basically, you can go and watch the video on his Twitter page, what I was just talking about.
[02:14:26.835 --> 02:14:28.136]  This guy confronts him.
[02:14:28.176 --> 02:14:31.077]  He was literally just beaten up by Muslim migrants.
[02:14:31.137 --> 02:14:32.818]  And he goes to Tommy Robinson and says,
[02:14:34.183 --> 02:14:39.046]  How dare you suggest that there's no positive benefit to bringing all these people into the country?
[02:14:39.466 --> 02:14:43.209]  And again, you have to make a distinction in the debate.
[02:14:43.269 --> 02:14:55.196]  Yes, skilled immigration is good at a slow pace when these people can be integrated into society and when they're generally economically prosperous and they've got a stake in society.
[02:14:55.516 --> 02:14:57.317]  You can't just import 1.1 million people
[02:14:59.318 --> 02:15:05.980]  Within the course of 12 months, as Germany has done, without there being massive cultural and societal problems.
[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:07.640]  Which is what we've seen.
[02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:10.040]  And this is out of Gateway Pundit.
[02:15:10.921 --> 02:15:16.302]  Mother of 10-year-old boy raped by migrant says she regrets telling children, migrants need our help.
[02:15:16.922 --> 02:15:18.742]  Now this is a story that we covered yesterday.
[02:15:18.762 --> 02:15:20.743]  A Muslim migrant in Vienna, Austria,
[02:15:21.883 --> 02:15:23.263]  Raped a 10-year-old boy.
[02:15:23.603 --> 02:15:24.864]  He didn't try to flee.
[02:15:24.924 --> 02:15:27.104]  He thought it was perfectly normal behavior.
[02:15:27.484 --> 02:15:29.305]  He went back to the swimming pool.
[02:15:29.685 --> 02:15:42.228]  They actually arrested him when he was in the swimming pool because he thought this was just, again, routine behavior to go around raping 10-year-old boys because he thought it was justified because he was sexually frustrated.
[02:15:43.328 --> 02:15:52.316]  It turns out his mother is an immigrant, as is the child, and she initially taught her 10-year-old boy to be welcoming of these refugees.
[02:15:52.376 --> 02:15:55.659]  Well, now the boy's mother is speaking out.
[02:15:56.179 --> 02:16:03.606]  The mother of the boy who was raped by an Iraqi migrant in a swimming pool in Austria says she regrets teaching her children to be welcoming to migrants.
[02:16:04.186 --> 02:16:08.950]  The boy's mother, Dunja, who arrived in Austria as an immigrant in the 90s from Serbia,
[02:16:09.671 --> 02:16:16.178]  Said she had always taught her five children to offer the same hospitality to new arrivals that she had herself received.
[02:16:17.279 --> 02:16:22.245]  So now she's spoken out and said, look, this is a massive problem, which is interesting because
[02:16:23.208 --> 02:16:30.490]  The migrants from Serbia tend to be less radical than those coming from places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria.
[02:16:31.090 --> 02:16:37.312]  So now she's speaking out against that after initially teaching her son to be welcoming of the migrants.
[02:16:37.392 --> 02:16:40.493]  And again we're trying to get Tommy back on the line to talk about this.
[02:16:41.273 --> 02:16:44.374]  But here's another story out of Germany again.
[02:16:44.474 --> 02:16:49.416]  Refugees beat soccer players with iron rods in the street after tournament.
[02:16:50.478 --> 02:16:56.102]  Germany, a country of 80 million, received over 1 million migrants and unvetted refugees in 2015.
[02:16:56.703 --> 02:17:00.366]  Angela Merkel is expecting another million migrants this year.
[02:17:00.746 --> 02:17:03.869]  In five to seven years, the migrants will bring in their family members.
[02:17:04.669 --> 02:17:19.121]  The Now Build reports, basically these soccer players, they just finished a tournament, they were chased by 20 thugs from a nearby migrant camp and beat with iron rods, basically complete melee.
[02:17:20.369 --> 02:17:23.411]  And again, this is part of the cultural enrichment.
[02:17:24.732 --> 02:17:25.912]  You can go over to Canada.
[02:17:25.952 --> 02:17:27.713]  This is a story out of the rebel media.
[02:17:28.654 --> 02:17:33.877]  Liberals plan to build refugee camps on seven Canadian military bases.
[02:17:34.277 --> 02:17:37.119]  Taxpayers will fund mosques, Qurans.
[02:17:37.699 --> 02:17:48.606]  So it's not good enough, as in Germany, to, you know, evict Germans from their own homes to bring these Muslim migrants in, to take over gymnasiums, to take over office buildings.
[02:17:49.366 --> 02:18:05.460]  in Berlin to pay a taxpayer expense for 10,000 migrants to stay in three and four star hotels in Berlin, 10,000 of them, while Berlin's 10,000 homeless population remains on the streets.
[02:18:05.881 --> 02:18:10.244]  That's looking about 600 million euros to pay for this.
[02:18:10.945 --> 02:18:26.680]  And now the Canadian military has been ordered by Justin Trudeau, who is a massive social justice warrior, of course, to draft plans to house more than 6,000 Muslim migrants on a long-term basis at military bases, according to documents obtained exclusively by the rebel.
[02:18:27.301 --> 02:18:31.165]  This sounds almost too ridiculous to be true, but they've got the documents.
[02:18:31.185 --> 02:18:32.186]  They're here in the article.
[02:18:33.180 --> 02:18:45.490]  Included in the Department of National Defence budgets are hundreds of thousands of dollars set aside for religious support, including the purchase of Muslim Qurans, prayer mats and foot-washing towels.
[02:18:46.190 --> 02:18:50.134]  All part of the diversity that Canada is importing at taxpayer expense.
[02:18:50.814 --> 02:18:56.639]  The plans also call for the construction of mosques or worship centres using taxpayer dollars.
[02:18:57.677 --> 02:19:13.184]  Now this is interesting because Canada initially said they were only going to bring in women and children from Syria, so actual refugees and not these economic migrants that have been exploiting that and pouring into the West as a result.
[02:19:14.504 --> 02:19:16.305]  For a typical migrant family
[02:19:17.170 --> 02:19:24.093]  It's going to be a $200,000 a year subsidy, not including Medicare or welfare.
[02:19:24.633 --> 02:19:27.275]  This is in Canada.
[02:19:27.295 --> 02:19:30.016]  $200,000 a year at taxpayer expense for each family.
[02:19:30.894 --> 02:19:41.423]  It's shocking that Canadian Armed Forces personnel will be ordered to abandon the coalition battle against ISIS and return to Canada to become waiters, chauffeurs and social workers for Muslim migrants.
[02:19:41.823 --> 02:19:46.848]  And that Canadian Forces bases will be turned into squalid refugee camps.
[02:19:47.368 --> 02:19:54.954]  So they're actually taking the military bases in Canada and filling them with these migrants at taxpayer expense.
[02:19:55.695 --> 02:20:00.787]  We'll be back after the break, try to reconnect with Tommy Robinson, and go to a couple of your calls.

[02:22:09.113 --> 02:22:15.315]  Chronic inflammation is now known to block your ability to repair and compromises your immune system, making you more vulnerable to all diseases.
[02:22:15.795 --> 02:22:20.757]  Since poor diet, injuries, or stress are all contributing factors, many people suffer from inflammation.
[02:22:20.977 --> 02:22:25.839]  Your body's number one means of neutralizing inflammation and the pain that it may be causing is glutathione.
[02:22:26.099 --> 02:22:30.460]  Glutathione is the body's number one peptide to neutralize free radicals and thus stop inflammation.
[02:22:30.660 --> 02:22:32.161]  Hi, my name is Jason.
[02:22:32.201 --> 02:22:32.821]  I'm 44 years old.
[02:22:33.001 --> 02:22:39.225]  For 10 years I had been suffering from chronic pain in my abdomen and groin that radiated down into my feet.
[02:22:39.365 --> 02:22:46.590]  After three weeks on One World Way, the pain in my feet reduced by 50% and the overall pain in my body reduced significantly as well.
[02:22:46.710 --> 02:22:49.052]  I ran out of One World Way and the pain returned.
[02:22:49.272 --> 02:22:54.916]  I got another container and again after three weeks the pain reduced significantly throughout my body.
[02:22:55.076 --> 02:22:56.777]  I'd highly recommend One World Way to
[02:22:57.077 --> 02:22:59.643]  Anyone dealing with chronic pain due to inflammation.
[02:22:59.723 --> 02:23:00.906]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:23:00.926 --> 02:23:01.467]  That's OneWorld.
[02:23:01.487 --> 02:23:01.727]  W-H-E-Y.com
[02:23:08.049 --> 02:23:10.070]  Paid for by Bonner and Partners, an independent research firm.
[02:23:10.430 --> 02:23:19.915]  Fed up after years spent fighting big government in Washington, D.C., a multimillionaire businessman has spent the last 30 years tracking an obscure threat to America.
[02:23:20.115 --> 02:23:23.797]  Today, he says it's about to reach a sudden and disturbing conclusion.
[02:23:24.077 --> 02:23:27.439]  If he's right, your way of life is about to change very suddenly.
[02:23:27.799 --> 02:23:32.402]  From where you shop, to the doctors you visit, to your retirement, and the family you want to protect.
[02:23:32.842 --> 02:23:34.763]  Now, he's made predictions like this before.
[02:23:35.023 --> 02:23:36.443]  And he was right then, too.
[02:23:36.883 --> 02:23:39.684]  A few years ago, he warned that housing prices would collapse.
[02:23:40.024 --> 02:23:40.464]  They did.
[02:23:40.844 --> 02:23:43.665]  Before that, he warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[02:23:44.085 --> 02:23:44.565]  They did.
[02:23:44.906 --> 02:23:47.006]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[02:23:47.266 --> 02:23:49.587]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[02:23:49.947 --> 02:23:51.328]  This will affect us all.
[02:23:51.588 --> 02:23:57.051]  A free video he's released online details everything you need to know at dollardownfall.com.
[02:23:57.331 --> 02:24:03.134]  Now maybe you'll disagree with his conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.
[02:24:03.534 --> 02:24:05.455]  Just go to dollardownfall.com.
[02:24:05.675 --> 02:24:06.976]  That's dollardownfall.com.
[02:24:21.716 --> 02:24:24.238]  We have Tommy Robinson back on the line.
[02:24:24.298 --> 02:24:32.205]  Tommy, just before we lost you, I was asking you about this clip that Channel 4 posted of this guy who was actually attacked in his own home by these migrants.
[02:24:32.846 --> 02:24:35.328]  But again, still defends them.
[02:24:35.368 --> 02:24:38.071]  We've got feminists in Cologne handing out roses.
[02:24:38.131 --> 02:24:41.694]  We've got rape victims keeping quiet about their ordeal.
[02:24:41.834 --> 02:24:43.055]  Because it's easy to do so.
[02:24:43.075 --> 02:24:43.495]  It's easy.
[02:24:43.515 --> 02:24:45.396]  What's not easy is to do what we do.
[02:25:06.532 --> 02:25:22.605]  What's not easy is to criticise Islam and tell the truth about Islam because you get violently attacked, you lose your job, you lose your career and currently the free speech market in the UK is governed by the far left and they decide what is and what isn't allowed to be said.
[02:25:23.946 --> 02:25:33.913]  I had an interesting day today, I spent a day with a German girl who is doing her Masters and she's travelled over to interview me and she said she was brought up in a very left-wing family.
[02:25:35.695 --> 02:25:37.937]  And she's doing a thesis on Pagida.
[02:25:38.557 --> 02:25:43.742]  And she said that everything that Pagida is saying, she said she finds her own mother who is very leftist.
[02:25:44.242 --> 02:25:51.148]  She says now her own mother is saying it, but she still would never say she would never support support groups like Pagida.
[02:25:51.812 --> 02:25:54.074]  Because of the mainstream media perception of them.
[02:25:54.434 --> 02:26:00.139]  So, not because of the views, because everything they're saying mirrors what her own mother, it mirrors exactly what she was saying.
[02:26:00.159 --> 02:26:03.902]  She said that they put a refugee centre asylum seeker at the end of her road.
[02:26:04.102 --> 02:26:05.003]  And they're now scared.
[02:26:05.043 --> 02:26:05.563]  She's scared.
[02:26:05.984 --> 02:26:19.935]  And this was someone that, this was a complete left-wing liberal who would have been wanting to bring refugees in, similar to the lady that taught her son who was 10 years old who's just been anally raped in a swimming pool changing room.
[02:26:21.876 --> 02:26:24.779]  His mum also was welcomed to refugees.
[02:26:25.659 --> 02:26:27.561]  And I don't really know what it's going to take.
[02:26:27.821 --> 02:26:38.230]  The things that we've seen already in Europe, do you think the whole of Europe would be exploding and taking to the streets with the devastation that they're seeing happening?
[02:26:38.290 --> 02:26:42.213]  It's like an invading army is coming into your country and raping your women.
[02:26:42.934 --> 02:26:44.074]  And the men are just standing there.
[02:26:45.075 --> 02:26:49.439]  And that's most certainly how it looks within Sweden especially.
[02:26:50.222 --> 02:26:53.144]  But I don't see these problems getting any better.
[02:26:53.224 --> 02:27:01.690]  If we look to France, where we've just seen at the weekend the retired Army General, who has been arrested there.
[02:27:01.730 --> 02:27:04.972]  He's been arrested for attending an anti-Islam rally.
[02:27:05.052 --> 02:27:07.574]  So there was going to be a rally for Baguida in Calais.
[02:27:08.075 --> 02:27:13.018]  Now this is France, and this is the thing that we say, the more Islam, the less freedom.
[02:27:13.618 --> 02:27:17.221]  In France, they're still under a state of emergency from the Paris attacks.
[02:27:17.938 --> 02:27:20.842]  This is the country that gives the Statue of Liberty to America.
[02:27:21.563 --> 02:27:24.106]  This is the country that prides itself on liberty and freedom.
[02:27:24.687 --> 02:27:32.077]  And here they are, banning, banning their own citizens from having democratic free assemblies, banning them.
[02:27:32.657 --> 02:27:34.260]  They're not allowed to come out on the street.
[02:27:34.280 --> 02:27:35.281]  They're not allowed to protest.
[02:27:36.243 --> 02:27:38.564]  So that's how far France has already gone.
[02:27:38.604 --> 02:27:43.868]  They've lost their democratic rights, they've lost their freedom of assembly, and that's just a sign of the future times.
[02:27:44.328 --> 02:27:45.769]  The government will force you.
[02:27:46.289 --> 02:27:52.893]  Even if you want to have a say, the government will take your right to say anything away from you, as we've just seen in France.
[02:27:52.993 --> 02:28:00.038]  I don't know, I think there's going to be an acceleration of developments this coming year across Europe.
[02:28:00.058 --> 02:28:01.939]  It's not going to be pretty.
[02:28:03.666 --> 02:28:09.089]  Well, I mean, we've had numerous major army chiefs and, you know, police experts over the past few months come out.
[02:28:09.605 --> 02:28:30.345]  And in France, indeed, they've got the army, this came out in the Telegraph, preparing for the re-appropriation of national territory, because they think these ghetto Muslim communities, you know, France is about, what, 7% Muslim now, are going to rise up, are going to be radicalised and armed, and they're going to violently try to take territory in these major cities in France.
[02:28:30.365 --> 02:28:32.727]  We saw it with the Paris riots back in 2005.
[02:28:34.389 --> 02:28:44.956]  But, and again, the sheer hypocrisy of it, and it is a kind of Stockholm Syndrome, it's like, if they align with their abusers, it's kind of easier to swallow.
[02:28:44.996 --> 02:28:46.977]  They don't have to face up to the problem.
[02:28:47.197 --> 02:28:50.600]  So it's kind of a mass Stockholm Syndrome that we see going on with the left.
[02:28:51.300 --> 02:28:54.102]  And they also share this grievance culture with
[02:28:54.642 --> 02:29:04.270]  Islamists, which I think is why they identify with Islamists so much, these extreme leftists, because they hate the West, just like the Islamists, they hate the West.
[02:29:05.010 --> 02:29:15.259]  And they're, you know, they're just like Islamists, they're racists generally against white people, so they actually share these regressive anti-Western beliefs, which is why they're aligning, correct?
[02:29:16.380 --> 02:29:17.120]  Yeah, they're aligning.
[02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:20.403]  They see it as the best option to overthrow rule of law and democracy.
[02:29:20.976 --> 02:29:24.798]  They see it as the best option, but let's not kid ourselves, they despise religion as well.
[02:29:25.318 --> 02:29:30.481]  So it's like a loose alliance, a very loose alliance, where they're both using each other.
[02:29:31.001 --> 02:29:35.724]  They're both using each other, but the left should learn from what happened in Lebanon, that the first people that will be turned will be them.
[02:29:37.103 --> 02:29:39.325]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:39.345 --> 02:29:41.266]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.423 --> 02:30:25.487]  If polls are to be believed, Hillary Clinton's once commanding national lead over Bernie Sanders appears to have evaporated in a matter of days, pointing to trouble ahead for the former Secretary of State as voters cast their ballots Tuesday in Sanders-friendly New Hampshire, reports Fox News.
[02:30:25.847 --> 02:30:34.949]  A recent Reuters poll shows Clinton leading Sanders 48 to 45, while state polls are far better indicators going into each individual primary.
[02:30:35.109 --> 02:30:37.932]  National polls help gauge the candidate's broader appeal.
[02:30:38.152 --> 02:30:49.282]  Over the past several months, Clinton has at times led the national polls by more than 30 points, contributing to her front-runner label, even as she has faced tough races in Iowa and New Hampshire.
[02:30:49.522 --> 02:31:00.692]  But Sanders may be heading for a big win in New Hampshire Tuesday night, if he can hold off Clinton, who has gotten tougher on the Vermont senator in recent days, as her husband Bill Clinton ratchets up his attacks.
[02:31:01.293 --> 02:31:03.801]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com

[02:31:13.910 --> 02:31:18.535]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[02:31:18.675 --> 02:31:19.716]  Talk about the effects.
[02:31:20.016 --> 02:31:26.302]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning, I have drive to go to the gym, I feel like I look better, I feel better, I feel sexier.

[02:32:00.902 --> 02:32:04.003]  I basically have my gallbladder out within the last nine months.
[02:32:04.023 --> 02:32:06.363]  Needed to get my digestive system working correctly.
[02:32:22.367 --> 02:32:22.988]  I don't know.
[02:32:39.527 --> 02:32:42.992]  I want to challenge the listeners who have not tried X2 for yourselves.
[02:32:43.192 --> 02:32:44.233]  What do you have to lose?

[02:32:53.553 --> 02:32:57.374]  I noticed significant change in my digestive flow.
[02:32:57.394 --> 02:32:58.914]  I was, like, really more natural.

[02:33:27.492 --> 02:33:28.433]  Your call's in a minute.
[02:33:28.873 --> 02:33:35.280]  First, I want to direct you to infowarsstore.com because the all-new Pro-Pure shower filter has arrived.
[02:33:35.320 --> 02:33:37.963]  This is the Pro Max 4-stage shower filter.
[02:33:38.706 --> 02:33:46.953]  ...reduces and removes over 200 contaminants from shower water, including heavy metals, VOCs, pesticides, fluoride, chlorine, pharmaceuticals, and odours.
[02:33:47.013 --> 02:33:56.021]  It's BPA-free plastic, easy to install, has a filtration capacity of up to nine months, and it's important to support us because we don't get...
[02:33:56.641 --> 02:34:01.324]  Pharmaceutical dollars in the hundreds of millions from big corporations.
[02:34:01.364 --> 02:34:03.025]  We're not funded by George Soros.
[02:34:03.085 --> 02:34:10.430]  We're funded by you buying the products which pays for our reporters to go out in the field and challenge the mainstream media.
[02:34:11.050 --> 02:34:20.796]  And the mainstream media needs to be challenged on this migrant issue because, Tommy, we've seen this whole thing being characterized by this overwhelming cover-up.
[02:34:21.137 --> 02:34:26.080]  The former head of ZDF, the top broadcaster in Germany, came out last week and said
[02:34:26.460 --> 02:34:31.143]  We report what the government tells us what to report, to please Merkel.
[02:34:31.483 --> 02:34:35.106]  We're not allowed to say anything negative about the refugees.
[02:34:35.506 --> 02:34:37.788]  And we've seen this in other European countries as well.
[02:34:38.248 --> 02:34:42.311]  There's this coordinated effort to cover up this migrant rape scandal.
[02:34:42.851 --> 02:34:45.875]  God only knows what, you know, hasn't been reported.
[02:34:45.935 --> 02:34:49.580]  I'm getting told stuff privately, which is just as bad, if not worse.
[02:34:50.061 --> 02:34:57.631]  But you appeared on Al Jazeera a couple of days ago, I think, and they censored an entire segment from your interview.
[02:34:57.691 --> 02:34:58.512]  Tell us what happened.
[02:34:59.403 --> 02:35:12.388]  So, yeah, I was asked on Al Jazeera, and I use an app now called Periscope, so when I'm talking to journalists or doing an interview, I screen it live so people can watch, you know, if I think there could be anything suspect about the interview.
[02:35:12.428 --> 02:35:16.069]  Now, when I went on this interview, his name was Peter Dobby.
[02:35:16.109 --> 02:35:17.170]  He used to be in the UK.
[02:35:17.690 --> 02:35:18.630]  He used to work for the BBC.
[02:35:18.670 --> 02:35:25.453]  He's obviously took a big money paycheck and gone out to Qatar, in Doha, Doha in Qatar, and he's asking me questions.
[02:35:25.473 --> 02:35:28.074]  What he says is, he says, I've got the Quran in front of me.
[02:35:29.159 --> 02:35:30.200]  I'm reading from the Quran.
[02:35:30.920 --> 02:35:33.882]  He says, I'm going to read you some chapters now from the holy book.
[02:35:34.523 --> 02:35:39.046]  And then he reads out some verses about stoning women to death and men and women to death, etc.
[02:35:39.426 --> 02:35:42.788]  And he says, what's the first thing you think when you hear this?
[02:35:43.128 --> 02:35:45.890]  Now I knew straight away, I said, you're reading from the Old Testament.
[02:35:46.758 --> 02:35:50.299]  But he obviously was trying to trick me where he must have thought I was stupid.
[02:35:50.319 --> 02:35:51.800]  So I said, you're reading from the Old Testament.
[02:35:52.580 --> 02:35:54.001]  What are you even trying to do?
[02:35:54.401 --> 02:35:57.082]  And then I asked him if he'd read the Quran himself.
[02:35:57.162 --> 02:35:57.742]  So he said, yes.
[02:35:57.882 --> 02:36:00.843]  And I said, OK, you're sitting in Qatar.
[02:36:01.043 --> 02:36:08.345]  And bearing in mind, I know that the punishment for blasphemy or for insulting the Prophet or even apostasy is death in Qatar.
[02:36:09.186 --> 02:36:13.687]  So I said, are you allowed to sit there freely and criticize the Prophet Muhammad?
[02:36:14.448 --> 02:36:15.548]  And he said, yes, I am.
[02:36:16.784 --> 02:36:34.656]  And then, so I continued then and said, well look, Mohammed murdered 600 people, he was a racist, he was a thief, he took a young girl who was six years old and he raped her when she was nine, called Aisha, and then when it actually went out on TV, everything I said about Mohammed was cut out.
[02:36:35.597 --> 02:36:46.484]  So when I sat and watched it, the whole, the rest of the show was all completely included and I also took the opportunity, seeing as I was talking to the Arab world and the Arab leaders, I took the opportunity to tell them that
[02:36:47.074 --> 02:36:49.795]  We don't want their oil money or their blood money in our country.
[02:36:49.996 --> 02:36:52.817]  Because the problem is that they are buying their way through our country.
[02:36:53.337 --> 02:36:56.079]  I was sitting in the building, I was sitting in the Shard.
[02:36:56.559 --> 02:37:01.881]  Now the Shard was built on apartheid rules, where no Israeli company could go in.
[02:37:02.502 --> 02:37:05.803]  I said, I was sitting in there and I said, you're trying to talk to me about immigration.
[02:37:06.264 --> 02:37:08.985]  No Israeli passport is allowed into the country you're in.
[02:37:09.605 --> 02:37:14.128]  I said, you're also, you want to talk about fascism or extremism.
[02:37:14.148 --> 02:37:16.649]  I said, the country you're in and the people who pay your paycheck,
[02:37:17.555 --> 02:37:19.638]  Actually fund extremism and terrorism worldwide.
[02:37:20.038 --> 02:37:20.759]  They fund Hamas.
[02:37:21.460 --> 02:37:33.856]  And so then here you are, to get into the building, what surprised me most, is to get into the building of the Shah, I had to go through an airport style security, where I had to take my belt off, my shoes off, I had to take everything off.
[02:37:33.876 --> 02:37:36.379]  And when I asked why, they said because of the Paris attacks.
[02:37:37.310 --> 02:37:54.106]  I said, but the Paris attacks come from the formation and the spread of money that your country and Saudi Arabia are funneling into Europe to Islamify and radicalise Wahhabist, Salafist mindset in my country.
[02:37:54.947 --> 02:38:02.454]  So when it went out, obviously they're getting a lot of flack now because he sat there and said, yes, you can criticise Mohammed, and then they cut everything I said about Mohammed out.
[02:38:04.361 --> 02:38:08.404]  And we've posted the clip on InfoWars, people can go and see it, probably won't have time to play it now.
[02:38:08.784 --> 02:38:15.469]  But you can see the part where they cut out and basically you're talking about, you know, Mohammed marrying and then raping a nine-year-old girl.
[02:38:15.830 --> 02:38:20.233]  That's what they didn't want their audience to hear because it's all about media censorship.
[02:38:20.593 --> 02:38:24.496]  The Old Testament thing, he's reading from the Old Testament expecting you to
[02:38:24.976 --> 02:38:25.636]  Fall for that.
[02:38:26.017 --> 02:38:29.518]  The point is, nobody's acting on anything that's in the Old Testament.
[02:38:29.578 --> 02:38:31.019]  People aren't beheading people.
[02:38:31.439 --> 02:38:33.400]  People aren't throwing gays off buildings.
[02:38:33.680 --> 02:38:38.682]  People aren't carrying out terror attacks because of anything they read in the Old Testament.
[02:38:39.062 --> 02:38:43.404]  They are from stuff they read in the Quran, which we had the story the other day out of Copenhagen.
[02:38:43.784 --> 02:38:50.787]  They, the police, they're hid for the fact for a year that the guy who attacked the cultural center during the Freedom of Speech event
[02:38:51.207 --> 02:38:58.030]  Had a gold-plated Quran, opened, bookmarked at the page where it said, you know, kill the disbelievers.
[02:38:58.370 --> 02:38:59.910]  They sat on that for a year.
[02:39:00.371 --> 02:39:03.712]  Those are the people acting out, not people who read the Old Testament.
[02:39:03.732 --> 02:39:06.313]  That's a completely debunked argument.
[02:39:06.933 --> 02:39:10.674]  We're going to go to some of these calls now because we're running out of time for Tommy Robinson.
[02:39:11.095 --> 02:39:13.736]  Charles in Ohio, you're on the air with a question for Tommy.
[02:39:13.776 --> 02:39:14.416]  Go ahead, Charles.
[02:39:15.888 --> 02:39:17.289]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[02:39:17.690 --> 02:39:26.478]  I just want to say, Mr. Robinson, you're a huge inspiration to me and I'm just a local guy and I'm trying to make a difference here in Ohio.
[02:39:27.519 --> 02:39:29.661]  I started a blog site, social media accounts.
[02:39:29.861 --> 02:39:32.924]  I'm doing everything I can to get the word out there and make a difference.
[02:39:33.765 --> 02:39:40.531]  My question is, what did you do and what can I do to be seen and be heard and make a difference before it's too late?
[02:39:41.505 --> 02:39:41.866]  Thank you.
[02:39:41.986 --> 02:39:49.055]  So, what I did, and I'm just an ordinary guy as well, I'm just an ordinary guy from Newtown, but what I did was get out on the street.
[02:39:49.674 --> 02:39:53.475]  And by getting out on the street, it made it impossible for them to ignore.
[02:39:53.836 --> 02:40:00.318]  What I've found is that when I left the English Defence League, there was a two-year period there where they just pretty much started to ignore things again.
[02:40:00.618 --> 02:40:01.638]  And they wouldn't talk about them.
[02:40:01.938 --> 02:40:11.522]  What we saw this weekend by holding mass demonstrations across the globe with Pagida, as far away as Australia, 12, 13 countries in Europe held rallies.
[02:40:12.002 --> 02:40:12.902]  It was a talking point.
[02:40:13.242 --> 02:40:15.163]  It brought the debate into people's faces.
[02:40:15.243 --> 02:40:16.403]  It was on radio stations.
[02:40:16.463 --> 02:40:17.144]  It was on the news.
[02:40:17.164 --> 02:40:17.824]  It was in paper.
[02:40:18.931 --> 02:40:19.793]  And that's what we need to do.
[02:40:20.054 --> 02:40:22.319]  We need to get out there and we need to make sure people know the truth.
[02:40:22.359 --> 02:40:24.624]  They need to understand the agenda of Islam.
[02:40:24.945 --> 02:40:26.208]  And one thing that's really shocked me
[02:40:26.906 --> 02:40:31.867]  The amount of Muslims that I'm meeting and debating with who don't know anything really about their own religion.
[02:40:32.208 --> 02:40:35.529]  They say, yes, I'm a Muslim, and I've sat there and told them things about Mohammed.
[02:40:35.929 --> 02:40:37.449]  And they said, did he really do that?
[02:40:37.689 --> 02:40:38.429]  I said, yes, he did.
[02:40:39.030 --> 02:40:40.790]  And I said, look, this is what the man done.
[02:40:41.330 --> 02:40:45.311]  And I think the biggest job we have is to expose the truth about Mohammed.
[02:40:45.351 --> 02:40:47.772]  That's what I want to do anyway, is expose the people.
[02:40:48.052 --> 02:40:52.473]  Because six, seven years ago in the UK, people were unaware that Mohammed killed anyone.
[02:40:52.754 --> 02:40:54.194]  They were unaware that he was a rapist.
[02:40:54.614 --> 02:40:57.556]  Unaware that he tortures people, unaware of all these things.
[02:40:57.756 --> 02:41:02.219]  We just take it for granted that Islam is like Christianity and Mohammed must have been like Jesus.
[02:41:02.779 --> 02:41:08.122]  But the biggest thing is just getting the truth out there and sticking to your guns and staying true to what you believe in.
[02:41:09.022 --> 02:41:15.346]  It would be great to see a mass movement of people out on the street in America as well, and in Canada, and across the world.
[02:41:16.227 --> 02:41:23.791]  And at a unified time, because by doing it at a unified time, it makes it impossible for the media to ignore, because it's part of something big.
[02:41:25.393 --> 02:41:25.633]  Yeah.
[02:41:26.233 --> 02:41:28.314]  We've got some difficult times ahead in America.
[02:41:28.734 --> 02:41:34.136]  You're in a situation, and Canada, all those countries are in a situation where they should be looking and learning.
[02:41:34.676 --> 02:41:38.558]  They should be looking at where we've messed up and stopping it.
[02:41:38.598 --> 02:41:40.319]  I still can't believe we're the Republic of Ireland.
[02:41:40.339 --> 02:41:42.739]  That's another country that can actually stop it.
[02:41:43.120 --> 02:41:44.780]  You've got the ability to prevent what's happening.
[02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:49.462]  But I just don't know if there's the will of the leadership of the country to stop it.
[02:41:51.354 --> 02:41:52.735]  Okay, Charles, thanks for the call.
[02:41:52.976 --> 02:41:53.876]  I mean, that's what it's about.
[02:41:53.896 --> 02:41:57.259]  It's about demolishing this narrative that Islam is a religion of peace.
[02:41:57.760 --> 02:42:02.524]  And you can do that by looking at what Muslims actually say in the Middle East.
[02:42:02.564 --> 02:42:05.827]  There was a Pew Research poll on Muslim attitudes in the Middle East.
[02:42:06.387 --> 02:42:12.873]  Again, in most of these countries, the vast majority of Muslims support these intolerant beliefs.
[02:42:12.933 --> 02:42:14.695]  This is not a tiny minority.
[02:42:15.075 --> 02:42:24.463]  And this is not a religion of peace and we're putting Europe under great threat in a security sense by importing this mass wave of intolerance.
[02:42:25.264 --> 02:42:27.566]  George in Connecticut, you're on the air with Tommy Robinson.
[02:42:27.606 --> 02:42:28.307]  Go ahead, George.
[02:42:29.367 --> 02:42:31.529]  Hi Tommy, it's nice to speak to you.
[02:42:31.549 --> 02:42:37.054]  I'm just wondering if you happen to know Lutz Bachmann out in Germany.
[02:42:37.394 --> 02:42:38.595]  You've been to many demonstrations.
[02:42:38.655 --> 02:42:40.137]  Is one of you out in Germany at all?
[02:42:40.897 --> 02:42:41.538]  I know Lutz, yeah.
[02:42:43.226 --> 02:42:50.912]  Yeah, he may actually be a cousin of mine, I don't know for sure, but I looked up some stuff and he actually may be a cousin.
[02:42:51.292 --> 02:43:01.079]  I just find the whole debate on this stuff is ridiculous, because you should really bring out, you know, you should try to find some people who have converted from Islam.
[02:43:01.439 --> 02:43:12.828]  There's lots of them, you can find them all over the web, and if you could bring some of them to speak out about their religion and what the real deal is, I think you'd convert a lot of people, because it'd be kind of hard for
[02:43:13.388 --> 02:43:21.392]  Both Muslims and these numskulls that want to believe that it's a peaceful religion would convert a lot of them.
[02:43:21.452 --> 02:43:31.176]  But, I mean, I used to know, I used to be in with a lot of Muslims when I was in college because I was into understanding all types of religions because I lived in Asia and various other places.
[02:43:31.736 --> 02:43:35.660]  And I'll tell you, I was in diplomatic circles, because I had some pretty high friends.
[02:43:36.060 --> 02:43:50.534]  And when I went to their houses, some of the security people would show me their collection, because I have a German background, their collection of Nazi books and stuff like that, and how they revered the killing of Jews and stuff like that.
[02:43:50.854 --> 02:43:54.117]  So these people are the real Muslim Nazis.
[02:43:54.137 --> 02:43:55.699]  When people say Islamo-Nazis,
[02:43:56.409 --> 02:43:57.150]  They really are.
[02:43:57.231 --> 02:44:01.497]  I mean, I'm not to say all of them, but at the highest levels, that's what their attitude is.
[02:44:01.597 --> 02:44:07.246]  I mean, I can say that from actually meeting these people at the highest levels and speaking to them and the way they talk.
[02:44:07.967 --> 02:44:10.891]  You can see that by the countries where Mein Kampf is the best seller.
[02:44:11.092 --> 02:44:11.953]  It's the customary elite.
[02:44:12.623 --> 02:44:21.268]  And also, when you talk about ex-Muslims, one of our speakers on Saturday at our rally in Birmingham was an ex-Muslim called Mohammed from Pakistan.
[02:44:21.688 --> 02:44:28.852]  And he gave a speech about his human rights and the ability... We have 3,000 to 4,000 apostates from Islam Hoi in the UK.
[02:44:29.213 --> 02:44:30.553]  And there's no charity to help them.
[02:44:31.114 --> 02:44:37.037]  There's no charity or government support to help these people get out of what necessarily is a cult.
[02:44:37.537 --> 02:44:38.878]  And also, just on the looks back,
[02:44:41.103 --> 02:44:54.251]  I met them and it was so refreshing because, look, I have a bit of a check of history, but if it wasn't for that check of history, or the mindset I had as a youth growing up, I wouldn't have been able to do or say the things I'm doing.
[02:44:54.712 --> 02:44:58.594]  I'd have run away at the first beating I had, the first terrorist threat.
[02:44:58.874 --> 02:45:04.658]  The first time the police come to my house and told my wife and me that a terrorist wanted to kill us, we would have stopped.
[02:45:05.158 --> 02:45:06.159]  Now Lutz is the same.
[02:45:06.179 --> 02:45:11.784]  When I met Lutz, I know full well that that organisation and those leaders are not going to back down, they're not going to stop.
[02:45:12.124 --> 02:45:18.550]  Because if they take a certain sort of character and Lutz is that character, that's why I've got to take my hat in admiration at him and Vicky and the people behind the team in Germany.
[02:45:19.010 --> 02:45:21.252]  And they're as far away from Nazis as you can get.
[02:45:21.673 --> 02:45:28.639]  That's why this whole mainstream media perception of people and what that actually does, the image, and it's all done to try and stop
[02:45:29.119 --> 02:45:29.700]  Stop support!
[02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:35.607]  It's done for people, to make it dirty, to make it a dirty thing to support groups like ours.
[02:45:36.508 --> 02:45:39.972]  But luckily so many people see through the mainstream media narrative now.
[02:45:40.352 --> 02:45:43.436]  And hopefully, hopefully Europe's rising.
[02:45:43.897 --> 02:45:46.680]  Especially the way Eastern Europe's rising, we just need to get Western Europe rising.
[02:45:48.723 --> 02:45:50.144]  Okay, George, thanks for the call.
[02:45:50.704 --> 02:45:52.366]  Yeah, just picking up on that, Tommy.
[02:45:52.826 --> 02:45:55.768]  On the Nazi issue, they tried to demonize you.
[02:45:56.408 --> 02:46:04.474]  From what I read a few days ago, Pegida's actually taking steps now to expunge these extremist elements from their ranks.
[02:46:04.514 --> 02:46:05.975]  They're trying to glom onto it.
[02:46:06.335 --> 02:46:12.760]  You tweeted about a guy with a neo-Nazi tattoo who you basically banned from attending the demonstration.
[02:46:13.060 --> 02:46:17.103]  Tell us about that process of filtering out these actual extremists.
[02:46:17.810 --> 02:46:20.131]  Well, I don't think in Germany they have that.
[02:46:20.211 --> 02:46:23.612]  From any of the demonstrations I've seen out there, they are mainstream.
[02:46:24.053 --> 02:46:28.455]  They've got ordinary mainstream old people, young people, families come in.
[02:46:28.755 --> 02:46:31.356]  They've got a complete mixture of the public.
[02:46:31.956 --> 02:46:35.618]  When I went on Saturday, I made it very clear, people know where I stand on this issue.
[02:46:36.278 --> 02:46:38.499]  We're opposed to Islam as an ideology.
[02:46:38.739 --> 02:46:41.020]  Nothing to do with colour of skin, nothing to do with race.
[02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:42.860]  He's got nothing to do with it.
[02:46:42.880 --> 02:46:49.862]  Now I turned up on Saturday and I walked into a hotel just in the morning and there was a man and lady there and they started talking to me.
[02:46:49.882 --> 02:46:51.722]  So I was talking to them, they said they were there for protest.
[02:46:52.202 --> 02:46:57.584]  I looked down at the man's hand and he had a swastika sign on his hand, tattooed.
[02:46:58.204 --> 02:47:01.605]  And then I looked at his face, his whole face was a tattoo.
[02:47:02.025 --> 02:47:04.085]  But he had 1488 under his eye.
[02:47:04.685 --> 02:47:07.926]  And then he had a star of Vegas on his forehead with eagle.
[02:47:08.638 --> 02:47:12.620]  And I just said, you're not coming to a protest, you're not coming to our demonstration.
[02:47:13.060 --> 02:47:18.624]  And I said, there's a 0% chance I'm being seen anywhere with you before you're walking on our demonstration with us.
[02:47:19.044 --> 02:47:20.665]  And then he got up and I just said, you need to leave.
[02:47:20.725 --> 02:47:21.525]  And he did leave.
[02:47:22.085 --> 02:47:26.228]  And now I'm getting, not a backlash, but I'm getting people messaging me saying, why did you kick this bloke out?
[02:47:26.248 --> 02:47:34.112]  But none of the people that come on the demonstration, it's just obviously, in the UK, the real far right, there isn't many of them, but the real far right despise me.
[02:47:34.602 --> 02:47:39.184]  I'm seen as a Zionist and a race traitor.
[02:47:39.664 --> 02:47:42.346]  And I said, look, simply to stick it to my morals.
[02:47:42.566 --> 02:47:46.648]  My morals are that to win this battle anyway in the UK, we need every community.
[02:47:46.668 --> 02:47:47.808]  We need every community on board.
[02:47:47.868 --> 02:47:53.411]  And I have a problem with, even when it comes to immigration, I don't have a problem with immigration per se myself.
[02:47:53.431 --> 02:47:54.811]  I have a problem with Islamic immigration.
[02:47:55.432 --> 02:47:57.273]  Most of the people I know are sons of immigrants.
[02:47:57.353 --> 02:47:58.193]  My mother was an immigrant.
[02:47:58.706 --> 02:47:59.287]  We're good.
[02:48:20.759 --> 02:48:23.300]  That's backward and it's not what we want in this country.
[02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:33.726]  And because of that mindset, that's why Mohammed, or Adam as he now is, that's why our first speaker on Saturday has been living in hiding in the UK for 20 years.
[02:48:34.626 --> 02:48:35.287]  Living in hiding.
[02:48:35.927 --> 02:48:42.190]  I've met quite a few apostates who are living in hiding because they fear their families, their mums, their dads will kill them.
[02:48:42.570 --> 02:48:44.151]  Islam's a religion of peace, Tommy.
[02:48:44.191 --> 02:48:45.312]  How could they possibly think that?
[02:48:45.996 --> 02:48:58.861]  That's it, but that is what we're importing and the sooner people see that, and you are right, I think it's valuable that we hear from ex-Muslims, which is why hopefully Mohamed now in the UK, his old name was Mohamed, will play a leading role in that.
[02:48:59.162 --> 02:49:03.603]  Because he stood up on stage and in his speech he said, he said, you keep calling Tommy a racist.
[02:49:04.404 --> 02:49:07.405]  You keep calling him a racist and he said, what are you going to call me?
[02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:09.021]  What are you going to call me?
[02:49:09.441 --> 02:49:10.362]  I'm from Pakistan.
[02:49:10.602 --> 02:49:18.007]  And he also brought his Pakistan flag, which to be honest, the symbolism of what that flag represents for me, I don't like it.
[02:49:18.407 --> 02:49:23.370]  Because of all the Pakistani grooming gangs, because of Pakistan as a country, because of the blasphemy laws, because of all these things.
[02:49:24.071 --> 02:49:25.892]  I'm not going to tell him he can't bring his flag.
[02:49:26.662 --> 02:49:35.947]  He held his flag because there's millions of Christians in Pakistan who are persecuted, who are targeted, but when he stood up he said, this is the flag of my heritage, this is where I'm from.
[02:49:36.547 --> 02:49:44.191]  He said, but I'm British first, Pakistani second, and also I had a lot of people trying to give me a bit of flack because he had his country's flag there.
[02:49:44.711 --> 02:49:47.132]  He was standing up on stage putting his life in danger.
[02:49:48.030 --> 02:49:50.553]  He's openly calling it on with Islam in the UK.
[02:49:51.054 --> 02:49:54.138]  And if he wants to buy his own country's flag, then I'm not going to tell him he can't.
[02:49:54.399 --> 02:49:58.284]  So, um, but yeah, we have, uh, we have so much to do.
[02:49:58.824 --> 02:49:59.806]  So many problems.
[02:50:00.990 --> 02:50:11.913]  And what we have to remember, of course, is that many ex-Muslims and indeed current Muslims stand up against this intolerance and there they become the immediate targets of the regressive left.
[02:50:11.953 --> 02:50:17.435]  We had a report put out by a left-wing group a few weeks ago called Hope Not Hate.
[02:50:17.895 --> 02:50:21.056]  They had a list of, quote, anti-Muslim bigots
[02:50:21.656 --> 02:50:28.783]  One of the people included on that list was a devout Muslim woman who campaigns against honour killings.
[02:50:28.904 --> 02:50:31.606]  She was put on a list of anti-Muslim bigots.
[02:50:31.666 --> 02:50:44.720]  So again, the regressive left has aligned with Islamists to the point where they now attack constantly people like, you know, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, people like Majeed Nawaz, who are standing up for the true reformation of Islam.
[02:50:45.100 --> 02:50:52.809]  Those people are the ideological bedfellows of Islamists, and they're part of the problem, which is why we need to keep calling them out.
[02:50:53.089 --> 02:50:56.513]  We'll be back with the final segment with Tommy Robinson.
[02:50:56.533 --> 02:50:58.655]  We've got David Knight coming up in the fourth hour.
[02:50:59.076 --> 02:51:03.301]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com, but join us for the final segment coming up.
[02:51:09.946 --> 02:51:12.610]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[02:51:12.670 --> 02:51:16.154]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[02:51:17.378 --> 02:51:20.539]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[02:51:20.860 --> 02:51:25.942]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[02:51:26.302 --> 02:51:27.523]  How is this even possible?
[02:51:27.783 --> 02:51:35.106]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[02:51:35.326 --> 02:51:42.749]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[02:51:42.969 --> 02:51:46.171]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[02:51:46.451 --> 02:51:53.879]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[02:51:54.260 --> 02:51:56.983]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[02:51:57.443 --> 02:52:01.508]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[02:52:01.568 --> 02:52:02.249]  That's Greens75.com.
[02:52:02.269 --> 02:52:02.669]  Greens75.com.
[02:52:08.857 --> 02:52:11.498]  If survivalist housing has been in your plans, get ready.
[02:52:11.698 --> 02:52:15.520]  We're bringing our Timberline Range Camps to you February 6th through 14th.
[02:52:15.760 --> 02:52:18.462]  The Great American Outdoor Show in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
[02:52:18.662 --> 02:52:25.305]  Get an up-close look at some of our most popular Timberline models, or visit survivalistcamps.com to pre-order a camp.
[02:52:25.505 --> 02:52:27.766]  We'll bring it to the show and save you the cost of shipping.
[02:52:28.106 --> 02:52:30.287]  It's the perfect time to get that camp you've wanted.
[02:52:30.528 --> 02:52:37.431]  Go to survivalistcamps.com, then plan on joining us at the Great American Outdoor Show in February in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
[02:52:38.573 --> 02:52:41.314]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[02:52:41.615 --> 02:52:44.236]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[02:52:44.256 --> 02:52:44.676]  Croix River.
[02:52:44.996 --> 02:52:45.657]  I loved my dad.
[02:52:46.037 --> 02:52:46.997]  The boy was too stubborn.
[02:52:47.237 --> 02:52:49.959]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[02:52:50.199 --> 02:52:50.699]  His excuse?
[02:52:51.059 --> 02:52:52.140]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[02:52:52.400 --> 02:52:53.681]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[02:52:54.001 --> 02:52:59.524]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[02:52:59.764 --> 02:53:00.504]  Don't wait.
[02:53:00.804 --> 02:53:03.165]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now.
[02:53:03.466 --> 02:53:05.707]  For not just your sake, but for the sake of your loved ones.
[02:53:05.967 --> 02:53:07.568]  Again, that's LibertyOnCall.org.
[02:53:09.651 --> 02:53:13.134]  I'm just a sweet old lady who needs help crossing the street.
[02:53:13.374 --> 02:53:18.519]  But the real reason I want to get to the other side is so I can steal your identity along the way.
[02:53:18.819 --> 02:53:25.284]  While you're holding onto my hand, the RFID reader in my purse is capturing all your personal information.
[02:53:25.545 --> 02:53:29.348]  Debit cards, credit cards, even your work ID badge isn't safe.
[02:53:29.728 --> 02:53:32.311]  Oh, you have an RFID chipped subway pass?
[02:53:32.551 --> 02:53:33.972]  Well now, so do I!
[02:53:35.413 --> 02:53:40.077]  Protect yourself from crimes you can't see with ID Stronghold wallets, card sleeves, and purses.
[02:53:40.297 --> 02:53:46.001]  ID Stronghold pioneered RFID blocking technology over 10 years ago to prevent electronic pickpocketing.
[02:53:46.121 --> 02:53:48.703]  Even when your wallet is open, imitators don't do that.
[02:53:48.984 --> 02:53:53.767]  ID Stronghold wallets even cost about the same as wallets in most stores, but give you extra protection.
[02:53:53.867 --> 02:53:58.031]  Visit idstronghold.com and get the original RFID blocking wallet.
[02:53:58.211 --> 02:54:00.312]  I'm Wal Augustinowicz, founder and CEO.
[02:54:00.473 --> 02:54:03.355]  Protect yourself from crimes you can't see with ID Stronghold.
[02:54:05.299 --> 02:54:07.098]  idstronghold.com
[02:54:22.273 --> 02:54:29.000]  Top story up on Infowars.com, Twitter announces partnership with Islamist feminists to restrict free speech.
[02:54:29.140 --> 02:54:44.495]  Twitter is organizing a trust and safety council with Islamists and feminists because of course they're the perfect source to go to for free speech control to prevent abuse, harassment and bullying which critics point out will lead to mass censorship on Twitter.
[02:54:44.935 --> 02:54:51.322]  They've already suspended the account of yet another prominent critic of Islam, Christina Laila.
[02:54:52.123 --> 02:54:56.948]  Saudi Arabia is Twitter's second biggest shareholder.
[02:54:57.468 --> 02:55:00.792]  I wonder if they've had any influence now as Twitter moves towards
[02:55:01.272 --> 02:55:02.634]  Outright censorship.
[02:55:02.834 --> 02:55:04.376]  Their stock is tanking.
[02:55:04.896 --> 02:55:15.388]  Top executives within Twitter are leaving the company and yet they still continue to march forward with these authoritarian, censorious policies aided by...
[02:55:16.449 --> 02:55:23.554]  That, again, that magic duo of Islamists and feminists who are aligned because they both hate free speech.
[02:55:24.114 --> 02:55:25.956]  But, Tommy, we've got a few minutes left here.
[02:55:25.996 --> 02:55:38.304]  Just summing up, we've got all these top security experts throughout Europe warning that if this mass immigration madness is not reversed, we're going to see civil unrest, maybe even war.
[02:55:38.884 --> 02:55:44.348]  Tell people where you think it's heading and then, in summary, how they can support you and get the book.
[02:55:45.923 --> 02:55:47.986]  That's exactly where it is headed, unfortunately.
[02:55:48.066 --> 02:55:56.496]  Unless we see in the next coming year a mass, mass movement of people putting immense pressure, because I think our political leaders fear more than a mass movement of people.
[02:55:57.196 --> 02:55:58.276]  That's what we need to see.
[02:55:58.436 --> 02:56:06.298]  And just while you were on that about the left-wing group, that was Hope Not Hate who made that report calling moderate Muslims anti-Muslim bigots.
[02:56:06.578 --> 02:56:08.059]  You have to look at where their funding comes from.
[02:56:08.099 --> 02:56:13.060]  That group's funding comes from open border policy groups in the United States as well.
[02:56:13.560 --> 02:56:17.001]  So, and I've met the leader there and he doesn't actually believe what he's writing.
[02:56:17.021 --> 02:56:22.042]  So a lot of these people are doing it for an agenda and for a career path because there's so much money on the left.
[02:56:23.243 --> 02:56:25.985]  People can get behind and support us just by joining.
[02:56:26.085 --> 02:56:30.950]  There is an anti-Islamist group in every country pretty much now and we're trying to coordinate them.
[02:56:31.171 --> 02:56:37.337]  We're trying to bring them all together under one banner so that on certain times of the year, I believe the next day will be sometime now in May,
[02:56:37.877 --> 02:56:43.143]  And then when that date comes in May, we'll take to the streets in the UK, in Germany, in Holland, in Australia.
[02:56:43.183 --> 02:56:46.207]  We hope that people in America join on and people in Canada join on.
[02:56:46.527 --> 02:56:55.898]  And then across the globe at the same moment, at the same time, people are showing solidarity and unity with each other and showing some sort of resistance to what's being forced upon our country.
[02:56:56.638 --> 02:56:57.338]  Because that's what it is.
[02:56:57.398 --> 02:56:58.318]  It's being forced upon us.
[02:56:58.358 --> 02:57:02.399]  And then with regards to the book, yeah, the book is just based on my story.
[02:57:02.419 --> 02:57:03.580]  It's called Enemy of the State.
[02:57:04.020 --> 02:57:15.943]  And it's the worrying story of the fact that the lengths the state will go to, and just how much influence Islam has already, the lengths they'll go to to silence and stop and disrupt
[02:57:16.678 --> 02:57:18.959]  Any criticism of Islam.
[02:57:19.379 --> 02:57:20.420]  I'm in court again tomorrow.
[02:57:20.660 --> 02:57:21.821]  I'm in court again tomorrow.
[02:57:22.161 --> 02:57:23.382]  It's just, it's never ending.
[02:57:24.122 --> 02:57:33.927]  And that's to tie you down and stop you and swamp you so much that you're just drowning in problems that the state is coming at you.
[02:57:34.047 --> 02:57:38.910]  So you don't have any energy or time to tackle what's happening to the country.
[02:57:40.376 --> 02:57:41.497]  Yeah, especially.
[02:57:41.577 --> 02:57:44.078]  And you can get it on TommyRobinson.co.uk or you can get it on Amazon.
[02:57:44.118 --> 02:57:47.820]  You can get it on Kindle in America, Kindle in most countries.
[02:57:49.801 --> 02:57:50.961]  Okay, that's going to wrap it up.
[02:57:51.001 --> 02:57:53.923]  Tommy, we'll be sure to have you back on as this unfolds.
[02:57:53.943 --> 02:57:54.763]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:57:55.578 --> 02:57:56.099]  Thank you very much.
[02:57:56.379 --> 02:57:56.639]  Thank you.
[02:57:56.819 --> 02:57:57.200]  Thank you.
[02:57:57.460 --> 02:57:58.802]  There goes Tommy Robinson.
[02:57:59.322 --> 02:58:01.965]  Final 50 seconds, let's hit a few more news stories here.
[02:58:02.466 --> 02:58:06.470]  Erdogan blackmailed EU for 30 billion over migrant crisis plan.
[02:58:06.510 --> 02:58:12.697]  He basically said, give us 30 billion dollars or we'll send these migrants over to Europe because they'll culturally enrich you.
[02:58:12.738 --> 02:58:14.399]  It's so positive and beneficial.
[02:58:15.160 --> 02:58:18.781]  After freeing Aleppo, Syrian Army Russian aircraft could focus on Raqqa.
[02:58:19.861 --> 02:58:27.223]  People like Marco Rubio aren't happy about that because the jihadist rebels that we armed and funded are failing in Syria.
[02:58:27.743 --> 02:58:30.984]  We've also got Twitter's attempt to silence Generation Trump.
[02:58:31.084 --> 02:58:33.765]  They're on an outright authoritarian free speech.
[02:58:34.105 --> 02:58:37.526]  Purge more of that with our top story at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:38.306 --> 02:58:39.928]  That's going to wrap it up for today's show.
[02:58:39.968 --> 02:58:42.431]  Be sure to join David Knight for the fourth hour.
[02:58:42.531 --> 02:58:45.034]  Also, InfoWars Nightly News coming up tonight.
[02:58:45.134 --> 02:58:47.517]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:47.557 --> 02:58:48.318]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:58:51.902 --> 02:58:55.887]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:59.364 --> 02:59:03.565]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[02:59:03.725 --> 02:59:07.687]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[02:59:07.887 --> 02:59:12.648]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[02:59:12.828 --> 02:59:17.350]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[02:59:17.490 --> 02:59:20.791]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:59:20.971 --> 02:59:24.292]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:24.412 --> 02:59:26.232]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:29.033 --> 02:59:29.973]  BrainForce is here.
[02:59:30.173 --> 02:59:32.274]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:59:32.374 --> 02:59:37.095]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:59:37.355 --> 02:59:39.015]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[02:59:39.055 --> 02:59:40.516]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:59:40.656 --> 02:59:43.877]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:59:44.137 --> 02:59:45.937]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:59:46.117 --> 02:59:47.017]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:59:47.037 --> 02:59:47.997]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:59:48.218 --> 02:59:50.098]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[03:00:01.158 --> 03:00:03.839]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:19.043 --> 03:00:25.305]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:27.397 --> 03:00:34.338]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this fourth hour of February 9th, 2016, the day of the New Hampshire primary.
[03:00:34.358 --> 03:00:36.259]  Of course, we've already had some voting begin.
[03:00:36.839 --> 03:00:39.619]  The small towns in New Hampshire are allowed to vote.
[03:00:39.859 --> 03:00:47.320]  Those that have less than 100 people can start voting at midnight, and they can report the results once everybody in the town has voted.
[03:00:47.380 --> 03:00:48.741]  So we have some results in there.
[03:00:48.761 --> 03:00:51.521]  But we're going to talk about the real results.
[03:00:51.621 --> 03:00:55.822]  You know, what is happening now with the first voting, that's not really the first voting.
[03:00:56.542 --> 03:01:01.226]  The first voting was done way, way back last year sometime.
[03:01:01.266 --> 03:01:15.037]  If you look at the superdelegates, and we're going to break this down in detail, Hillary Clinton, using superdelegates, and we'll tell you what that is, already has 15% of the delegates she needs to win the nomination.
[03:01:15.077 --> 03:01:17.679]  And that's before any of the voting begins.
[03:01:17.719 --> 03:01:23.424]  We're going to talk to you about what's going on there, break down some of the early results in New Hampshire.
[03:01:24.525 --> 03:01:28.366]  We're going to have live coverage of the Trump Watch Party in New Hampshire.
[03:01:28.386 --> 03:01:30.787]  That's going to be beginning at 6 p.m.
[03:01:30.847 --> 03:01:31.747]  Central, 7 p.m.
[03:01:31.847 --> 03:01:32.167]  Eastern.
[03:01:32.768 --> 03:01:35.708]  That's going to be on the Alex Jones Live Ustream channel.
[03:01:36.129 --> 03:01:43.111]  And then we'll be joining an hour later with live coverage with our InfoWars Nightly News crew at the typical time we do the nightly news.
[03:01:43.131 --> 03:01:44.671]  That'll be at 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:01:44.751 --> 03:01:45.071]  Eastern.
[03:01:45.571 --> 03:01:48.572]  By that time we should have a lot of results to take a look at.
[03:01:48.992 --> 03:01:50.493]  And of course the big fight
[03:01:51.033 --> 03:01:52.294]  Is on for second place.
[03:01:52.395 --> 03:01:58.040]  All the polls are saying that Donald Trump is far ahead in terms of first place in New Hampshire.
[03:01:58.060 --> 03:01:59.302]  The interesting thing is going to be...
[03:02:00.379 --> 03:02:13.402]  That some of these people who are fighting for second place and some of these lower tier candidates who get less than 10 percent, their votes are going to be turned over to the winner, which would be Donald Trump.
[03:02:13.562 --> 03:02:20.103]  So he's going to pick up not only the delegates on his side, but he's going to pick up the delegates for those who get less than 10 percent.
[03:02:20.123 --> 03:02:23.764]  Of course, that won't be an issue on the Democrat side since there's only two candidates.
[03:02:24.424 --> 03:02:28.306]  And the superdelegate issue on the Republican side is not really that big.
[03:02:28.346 --> 03:02:33.829]  There's five times the number of superdelegates in the Democrat party than there is in the Republican party.
[03:02:33.849 --> 03:02:35.990]  You can see the effect of how that is working.
[03:02:36.010 --> 03:02:48.217]  I mean, we've all looked at what Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the head of the DNC, has done as a gift to Hillary Clinton in terms of the way she scheduled the debates, putting them on the last Saturday before Christmas, putting
[03:02:48.457 --> 03:02:48.717]  I don't
[03:03:10.556 --> 03:03:13.218]  Between now and March, so we'll see what happens with that.
[03:03:13.238 --> 03:03:18.822]  But it just shows one of the aspects, the way they rig this whole process.
[03:03:19.303 --> 03:03:22.185]  Now we've got an article up on Infowars.com.
[03:03:22.245 --> 03:03:26.809]  The creator of Dilbert predicts that the GOP will rig New Hampshire.
[03:03:26.869 --> 03:03:36.136]  Scott Adams, the creator of the popular Dilbert cartoon series, predicts that the GOP will rig tonight's primary in New Hampshire as a favor to establishment favorite Marco Rubio.
[03:03:36.256 --> 03:03:38.698]  And it's interesting because after this horrible debate
[03:03:39.218 --> 03:03:39.618]  That's right.
[03:03:58.095 --> 03:04:00.758]  We also have some stories about driverless cars.
[03:04:00.778 --> 03:04:05.984]  There was a Drudge Report article, why driverless cars will screech to a halt.
[03:04:06.064 --> 03:04:08.306]  It was an op-ed piece by Stephen Hill.
[03:04:08.867 --> 03:04:13.071]  He believes that liability and regulatory issues are going to bring that to a halt.
[03:04:13.692 --> 03:04:15.313]  I wish I could agree with that.
[03:04:15.934 --> 03:04:24.243]  I wish I could agree with him that letting a 3,000 pound death machine stare itself with no human at the controls is a huge problem.
[03:04:25.144 --> 03:04:25.945]  I agree with that.
[03:04:26.226 --> 03:04:33.474]  I just don't think that the current system that we have, you're going to have a problem with the insurance companies and the government.
[03:04:33.976 --> 03:04:35.817]  With liability and with regulatory issues.
[03:04:36.137 --> 03:04:38.619]  I believe they're the ones who are pushing for this the hardest.
[03:04:39.299 --> 03:04:48.485]  I think the insurance companies as well as a couple of well-connected crony capitalist organizations like Uber and even the automobile companies themselves.
[03:04:49.065 --> 03:04:56.835]  Ford is now not calling itself necessarily a car company in the future, they're calling themselves a transportation company.
[03:04:56.855 --> 03:05:01.881]  In other words, they think they can make alliances with the government and push their driverless cars.
[03:05:01.901 --> 03:05:03.864]  Stay with us, we'll be right back with all that news and more.
[03:05:09.198 --> 03:05:18.201]  The FBI formally confirmed that its investigation, connected to Hillary Clinton's private email server, remains ongoing in a letter released Monday, reports The Hill.
[03:05:18.341 --> 03:05:23.503]  The message does not offer any new details about the probe, which the Bureau has been reluctant to discuss.
[03:05:23.683 --> 03:05:29.945]  However, it represents the FBI's formal notification to the State Department that it is investigating the issue.
[03:05:30.205 --> 03:05:39.549]  The letter was sent on February 2nd, but released on Monday as part of an ongoing lawsuit related to the disclosure of Clinton's emails from conservative watchdog Judicial Watch.
[03:05:39.949 --> 03:05:48.492]  FBI Director James Comey has previously referenced the FBI probe, which the Bureau had previously declined to confirm or deny in court filings last year.
[03:05:48.792 --> 03:05:51.013]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:05:51.113 --> 03:05:54.915]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[03:06:17.688 --> 03:06:20.469]  And optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:06:20.709 --> 03:06:22.570]  Just one of the key compounds.
[03:06:22.670 --> 03:06:25.732]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:06:26.132 --> 03:06:28.413]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[03:06:28.653 --> 03:06:30.434]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[03:06:38.917 --> 03:06:43.119]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[03:06:43.299 --> 03:06:47.262]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.
[03:06:47.442 --> 03:06:52.224]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[03:06:52.384 --> 03:06:56.927]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.

[03:07:08.753 --> 03:07:12.475]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[03:07:12.735 --> 03:07:18.838]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[03:07:19.038 --> 03:07:26.021]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[03:07:26.321 --> 03:07:35.125]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[03:07:35.425 --> 03:07:41.369]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[03:07:41.609 --> 03:07:46.372]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[03:07:46.432 --> 03:07:49.775]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[03:07:50.035 --> 03:07:51.636]  No needles, no injections.
[03:07:51.916 --> 03:07:53.417]  Don't take my word for it.
[03:07:53.577 --> 03:07:54.598]  Try it for yourself.
[03:07:54.758 --> 03:07:56.339]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[03:08:05.566 --> 03:08:14.142]  And let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing.
[03:08:14.182 --> 03:08:15.505]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[03:08:25.640 --> 03:08:26.400]  But I would add this.
[03:08:26.460 --> 03:08:29.521]  Let's dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing.
[03:08:29.821 --> 03:08:31.381]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[03:08:31.681 --> 03:08:31.801]  Fact.
[03:08:31.821 --> 03:08:32.801]  Here's the bottom line.
[03:08:32.821 --> 03:08:35.702]  This notion that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing is just not true.
[03:08:35.722 --> 03:08:36.042]  There it is.
[03:08:36.282 --> 03:08:37.562]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[03:08:37.582 --> 03:08:37.923]  There it is.
[03:08:37.963 --> 03:08:39.063]  The memorized 25-second speech.
[03:08:39.083 --> 03:08:42.003]  Well, that's the reason why this campaign is so important.
[03:08:42.023 --> 03:08:43.204]  To the gang of eight, Bill, first.
[03:08:43.284 --> 03:08:44.464]  Well, here's the response.
[03:08:44.664 --> 03:08:51.145]  I think anyone who believes that Barack Obama isn't doing what he's doing on purpose doesn't understand what we're dealing with here.
[03:08:51.165 --> 03:08:51.285]  Okay?
[03:08:51.325 --> 03:08:52.185]  This is a president.
[03:08:52.465 --> 03:08:54.586]  This is a president who is trying to change this country.
[03:08:59.784 --> 03:09:04.293]  Find out more about the robotic politicians that want to enslave you at InfoWars.com.
[03:09:07.483 --> 03:09:10.225]  I love what Walker did with that Styx song.
[03:09:10.445 --> 03:09:11.246]  Mr. Roboto.
[03:09:11.286 --> 03:09:13.847]  That's actually Marco Roboto and you have to see that.
[03:09:13.867 --> 03:09:14.928]  We'll play that again tonight.
[03:09:15.448 --> 03:09:18.731]  With our live coverage that'll begin actually at 6 p.m.
[03:09:18.771 --> 03:09:19.091]  Central.
[03:09:19.111 --> 03:09:25.775]  We're going to be live-streaming from the Trump Watch Party in New Hampshire with our Infowars crew on the ground there, Richard Reeves and others.
[03:09:26.176 --> 03:09:29.658]  They'll be live-streaming that on Ustream, the Alex Jones live channel.
[03:09:29.678 --> 03:09:33.681]  Then we will begin with our nightly news coverage tonight at 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:09:33.741 --> 03:09:34.041]  Eastern.
[03:09:34.061 --> 03:09:37.283]  But again, the live coverage of the Watch Party will start about an hour earlier.
[03:09:37.803 --> 03:09:42.267]  They're going to have results, I think, a lot earlier than we saw with the Iowa caucus.
[03:09:42.307 --> 03:09:43.789]  Of course, that was in the Central Time Zone.
[03:09:43.809 --> 03:09:44.830]  It started an hour later.
[03:09:44.850 --> 03:09:50.074]  Now we're going to have the polls closing in New Hampshire an hour earlier than they closed in Iowa.
[03:09:50.195 --> 03:09:53.257]  And, of course, it is an Eastern Time Zone.
[03:09:53.277 --> 03:09:55.639]  So we should have a lot of results as we begin the program.
[03:09:56.260 --> 03:10:02.369]  But going back to that song, Mr. Roboto, it's an absolute perfect fit to what we saw with Marco Rubio.
[03:10:02.389 --> 03:10:07.556]  If you listen to the lyrics, if you're not familiar with the song, of course it's probably 35 years since that song came out.
[03:10:08.516 --> 03:10:11.478]  Domo arigato, Marco Rubato.
[03:10:11.498 --> 03:10:13.919]  Okay, that's Japanese for thank you very much.
[03:10:14.220 --> 03:10:14.500]  Okay?
[03:10:15.180 --> 03:10:17.262]  Why would they be thanking him so much?
[03:10:17.422 --> 03:10:21.484]  Well, you know, he's a big proponent of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[03:10:21.584 --> 03:10:26.287]  And, you know, as I go on with the song, we played the song, it's secret, secret, I've got a secret.
[03:10:26.307 --> 03:10:27.728]  You know, it's a secret trade agreement.
[03:10:28.208 --> 03:10:30.930]  Is he a man or mannequin?
[03:10:31.050 --> 03:10:32.171]  We don't know, okay?
[03:10:32.291 --> 03:10:34.913]  But he certainly supports that trade agreement.
[03:10:35.493 --> 03:10:44.738]  And as I mentioned yesterday, the Brookings Institute pointed out that Donald Trump has been opposing these kinds of trade agreements as being bad deals going back 30 years.
[03:10:44.778 --> 03:10:53.382]  There's another article from Fusion that pointed out when he went on the Oprah Winfrey Show back in 1988, he was promoting his book, The Art of the Deal.
[03:10:54.102 --> 03:11:06.112]  And it turned to politics, because they've been taking out $100,000 ads in newspapers, New York Times and others, complaining about the way we were being treated in international trade agreements.
[03:11:06.453 --> 03:11:13.259]  This is something that's been going on a long time, and it seems to be the core issue for whether or not Donald Trump was going to run for president.
[03:11:13.639 --> 03:11:16.822]  He said, wait, we let Japan come in and we dumped everything right in our markets?
[03:11:17.322 --> 03:11:19.423]  They come over here, they sell their cars, their VCRs.
[03:11:19.463 --> 03:11:20.844]  Remember, this was back in 1988.
[03:11:21.144 --> 03:11:26.086]  He said, they knock the hell out of our companies and hey, I have tremendous respect for the Japanese people.
[03:11:26.566 --> 03:11:31.068]  This led Oprah to ask him if he wanted to run for president, which he replied, well, probably not.
[03:11:31.609 --> 03:11:34.210]  But I do get tired of seeing the country ripped off.
[03:11:34.270 --> 03:11:36.331]  I just don't think I have the inclination to do it.
[03:11:36.891 --> 03:11:42.494]  He says, if it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally because I'm tired of seeing what's happening with this country.
[03:11:42.554 --> 03:11:45.075]  We're really making other people live like kings and we're not.
[03:11:45.655 --> 03:11:48.157]  It's gotten a lot worse in this amount of time.
[03:11:48.497 --> 03:11:54.923]  And so when we look at Marco Rubato with his secret secret, he's got a secret with parts made in Japan, okay?
[03:11:54.963 --> 03:11:56.404]  Now they're made in China.
[03:11:57.044 --> 03:11:58.586]  We have exported our jobs.
[03:11:58.906 --> 03:12:01.928]  We're importing workers with the immigration system.
[03:12:01.988 --> 03:12:08.454]  And of course we've got our own congressman, like Ted Cruz, like Marco Rubio.
[03:12:09.918 --> 03:12:15.744]  Like Trey Gowdy, who voted with all them for the Trade Promotion Authority.
[03:12:15.764 --> 03:12:27.656]  They haven't gotten to the TPP yet, but the whole point of the Trade Promotion Authority was to grease the skids so that there wouldn't be any opposition, and to subvert the constitutional process for passing a treaty.
[03:12:28.397 --> 03:12:31.660]  So when you look at these senators and congressmen who did this,
[03:12:32.642 --> 03:12:36.664]  You gotta realize that what they are doing is outsourcing their jobs.
[03:12:37.104 --> 03:12:38.845]  They're outsourcing the Congress's jobs.
[03:12:38.865 --> 03:12:40.185]  Who are they outsourcing it to?
[03:12:40.785 --> 03:12:43.447]  They're outsourcing it to an international commission.
[03:12:43.867 --> 03:12:51.510]  As Senator Sessions pointed out, this international commission will then be free to manage our economy by managing our trade.
[03:12:52.170 --> 03:12:55.492]  It is a massive surrendering of sovereignty.
[03:12:56.152 --> 03:13:00.394]  To this international organization that has absolutely no accountability to us.
[03:13:01.395 --> 03:13:05.397]  Marco Rubio, when he was interviewed by a reporter, said, hey, I haven't read the 5,000 pages.
[03:13:05.417 --> 03:13:06.717]  That's 5,000 pages!
[03:13:06.777 --> 03:13:10.479]  I'm going to rely on the International Trade Commission to tell me what to think.
[03:13:10.539 --> 03:13:11.800]  Another bureaucracy, okay?
[03:13:12.260 --> 03:13:13.681]  He talked to the CFR.
[03:13:13.721 --> 03:13:19.504]  He says, I think it's very important, more important than ever, that Congress give the President trade promotion authority.
[03:13:19.564 --> 03:13:24.927]  This is the same guy that keeps repeating over and over again, four or five times in the debate that, you know,
[03:13:25.487 --> 03:13:28.469]  Barack Obama, we gotta get over the fiction that he doesn't know what he's doing.
[03:13:28.509 --> 03:13:29.849]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[03:13:30.210 --> 03:13:33.051]  He is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country.
[03:13:33.111 --> 03:13:41.496]  He wants to make America like the rest of the world, and yet Marco Rubio says, we, it's more important than ever, that Congress give the authority to manage our trade to Barack Obama.
[03:13:41.596 --> 03:13:44.377]  Understand, this is not free trade.
[03:13:44.457 --> 03:13:45.918]  That is the big lie.
[03:13:46.278 --> 03:13:48.820]  The big lie that's being told by the Republican Party.
[03:13:49.420 --> 03:13:51.762]  With everybody except for Donald Trump.
[03:13:51.782 --> 03:13:54.105]  They're all telling you the big lie that this is about free trade.
[03:13:54.685 --> 03:13:55.446]  It is not free trade.
[03:13:55.466 --> 03:13:58.289]  You don't need 5,000 pages for free trade.
[03:13:58.569 --> 03:14:07.358]  You need 5,000 pages if you're going to pull the wool over people's eyes, if you're going to manage trade, which means managing our economy, having other people do it.
[03:14:07.838 --> 03:14:12.023]  And it isn't even those 5,000 pages because once the agreement is passed,
[03:14:12.563 --> 03:14:19.547]  Then all authority passes to this commission, and it is, as Senator Sessions pointed out, a living agreement.
[03:14:20.188 --> 03:14:20.408]  Okay?
[03:14:20.448 --> 03:14:24.590]  In other words, it's not going to be limited to what is on the paper.
[03:14:24.950 --> 03:14:28.492]  It's going to be whatever this trade commission wants it to be.
[03:14:29.073 --> 03:14:29.913]  But let's play again.
[03:14:29.973 --> 03:14:32.295]  We played it earlier in the day, but I want you to hear again.
[03:14:32.995 --> 03:14:37.137]  Marco Rubio, just how robotic he is with his talking points.
[03:14:37.197 --> 03:14:44.361]  Again, we've got Marco short-circuiting as he starts to repeat these talking points about controlling the family.
[03:14:44.381 --> 03:14:45.061]  Let's play that clip.
[03:14:46.582 --> 03:14:51.725]  We are taking our message to families that are struggling to raise their children in the 21st century.
[03:14:52.045 --> 03:14:55.787]  Because as you saw, Jeanette and I are raising our four children in the 21st century.
[03:14:56.027 --> 03:15:01.710]  And we know how hard it's become to instill our values in our kids, instead of the values they try to ram down our throats.
[03:15:03.288 --> 03:15:15.172]  In the 21st century, it's become harder than ever to instill in your children the values they teach in our homes and in our church, instead of the values that they try to ram down our throats in the movies, in music, in popular culture.
[03:15:15.973 --> 03:15:19.094]  Yeah, it goes back and he does it again.
[03:15:19.114 --> 03:15:20.914]  Starts skipping like a broken record.
[03:15:21.354 --> 03:15:25.316]  Whenever he loses his place, he just resorts back to these, or when he gets in a tight spot,
[03:15:26.218 --> 03:15:29.679]  Then he goes back to these canned, memorized talking points.
[03:15:30.359 --> 03:15:31.680]  And he's doubling down on this.
[03:15:31.880 --> 03:15:35.781]  He's not saying, well, I misspoke because that is the essence of who he is.
[03:15:36.261 --> 03:15:38.122]  He can't say, well, you know, I just misspoke.
[03:15:38.162 --> 03:15:39.362]  Everybody has a rough night.
[03:15:39.422 --> 03:15:41.543]  It's a, you know, it's a, it's a live event.
[03:15:41.623 --> 03:15:42.583]  There's a lot of pressure.
[03:15:42.663 --> 03:15:44.984]  Everybody in the world is watching me, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:15:45.024 --> 03:15:47.585]  No, he can't be humble and say, I made a mistake.
[03:15:47.625 --> 03:15:51.966]  No, he has to say, I said what I meant to say, and I'm going to keep saying it again.
[03:15:52.066 --> 03:15:53.947]  Okay, well, it's getting even worse.
[03:15:54.247 --> 03:15:59.491]  As people are starting to troll his appearances, dressed up like robots.
[03:15:59.551 --> 03:16:01.713]  We've got this one clip here.
[03:16:01.993 --> 03:16:06.757]  Rubio supporters getting in a scuffle with the hashtag RobotRubioProtester.
[03:16:07.778 --> 03:16:10.940]  The optics on this are not looking good for the Rubio camp.
[03:16:10.980 --> 03:16:17.525]  You know, when people come up talking about how you are robotic tools of the establishment, I don't think it's a good idea.
[03:16:17.546 --> 03:16:18.426]  Have you got that clip ready?
[03:16:18.446 --> 03:16:20.468]  We can play that for the people who are watching this as B-roll.
[03:16:21.108 --> 03:16:27.593]  I don't think it's a good idea to start banging protesters with your candidate's sign.
[03:16:28.334 --> 03:16:29.595]  That's a Marco Rubio.
[03:16:29.915 --> 03:16:37.321]  They've got people grabbing this guy dressed up like a robot from behind, and then they're beating him with a Marco Rubio for president sign.
[03:16:37.902 --> 03:16:39.723]  That does not look good.
[03:16:39.903 --> 03:16:43.126]  That is a sign of massive desperation.
[03:16:43.706 --> 03:16:53.371]  Now, I've got some other political stuff that I want... Oh, actually, before I get on to the robotic cars, let me point out, I mentioned this briefly in the first couple of minutes of the Top of the Hour.
[03:16:53.391 --> 03:16:55.372]  We've got a story up on Infowars.com.
[03:16:55.752 --> 03:16:58.754]  The Dilbert creator predicts that the GOP will rig New Hampshire.
[03:16:58.854 --> 03:17:00.375]  He thinks that they're going to rig it for...
[03:17:01.135 --> 03:17:12.811]  Marco Rubio, Scott Adams, creator of the popular Dilbert cartoon series, predicts the GOP will rig tonight's primary in New Hampshire in favor of establishment favorite Marco Rubio.
[03:17:12.851 --> 03:17:16.877]  In a blog posting, he argues there's too much at stake for the fixers.
[03:17:17.157 --> 03:17:17.818]  The fixers.
[03:17:18.399 --> 03:17:22.161]  To not do anything to counter the juggernaut of Donald Trump's campaign.
[03:17:22.181 --> 03:17:26.082]  He says they've got a big decision to make about how far they're willing to go with this.
[03:17:26.182 --> 03:17:30.304]  If they don't fix the race or if they fix it only a little bit, Trump will win big.
[03:17:30.544 --> 03:17:31.605]  He might be unstoppable.
[03:17:31.905 --> 03:17:34.866]  You can't have that if you're the establishment fixers.
[03:17:35.026 --> 03:17:41.808]  So he says there's no natural reason to expect Rubio as the surprise search that he did in Iowa.
[03:17:41.828 --> 03:17:47.630]  Of course we see as many polls say that he's sinking, we saw how poorly he's doing, because that would be too obvious.
[03:17:47.650 --> 03:17:56.472]  So the Fixers, if such people exist, yeah they do, can either lose the White House or they can risk getting caught by making too large a fix.
[03:17:56.512 --> 03:17:58.213]  So which way would they go, he says?
[03:17:59.173 --> 03:18:01.954]  He answers this question by saying they would go for the big fix.
[03:18:02.095 --> 03:18:03.475]  They would risk detection.
[03:18:04.056 --> 03:18:09.498]  And he reasons that the people at the top are not the ones who would go to jail if the fix is detected.
[03:18:09.538 --> 03:18:11.379]  That's right, they're going to have plausible deniability.
[03:18:11.859 --> 03:18:16.822]  And they say his comments dovetail with reports that Fox News has already published mock-up results.
[03:18:17.022 --> 03:18:17.963]  That's a good way to call it.
[03:18:18.123 --> 03:18:19.043]  Mock-up results.
[03:18:19.103 --> 03:18:22.525]  I think they mock our knowledge of what's going on.
[03:18:22.805 --> 03:18:30.978]  Mock-up results from Fox News show Rubio in second place at 15%, behind Trump at 28%, okay, taking him down a few points.
[03:18:31.699 --> 03:18:33.162]  I think there's another aspect to this.
[03:18:33.262 --> 03:18:36.247]  I mean, they may try to just pull out the stops and go for broke.
[03:18:37.185 --> 03:18:39.608]  So we don't care what people think about this.
[03:18:39.628 --> 03:18:40.389]  We're going to rig it.
[03:18:40.529 --> 03:18:47.738]  The other aspect of this, I think, is that they're pushing hard to try to show that Jeb Bush has got momentum.
[03:18:48.299 --> 03:18:49.441]  Jeb Bush has got momentum.
[03:18:49.481 --> 03:18:55.669]  It reminds me of what they did with Rick Santorum in Iowa four years ago against Ron Paul, pulling him up.
[03:18:56.489 --> 03:19:13.380]  So that they could keep Romney in so that they could pull down Ron Paul so they could Use this this ringer to come in as a stalking horse essentially, so we'll see what happens I think the system is definitely rigging this for Marco Rubio as well as for Jeb Bush We'll see what's going on with that
[03:19:14.321 --> 03:19:22.346]  As we're looking at robotic candidates, there's this story that I started to talk about that was on Drudge, why driverless cars will screech to a halt.
[03:19:22.446 --> 03:19:32.752]  And of course, the person there says, there are huge liability and regulatory issues involved in letting a 3,000 pound death machine steer itself with no humans at the controls.
[03:19:32.892 --> 03:19:33.112]  Okay?
[03:19:33.152 --> 03:19:34.253]  He says, think about it.
[03:19:34.293 --> 03:19:38.495]  Every driver makes hundreds of daily driving decisions that, strictly speaking, break laws.
[03:19:38.535 --> 03:19:38.996]  For example,
[03:19:39.912 --> 03:19:44.114]  Pulling around the yellow line, crossing the yellow line to pull around a double-parked vehicle.
[03:19:44.134 --> 03:19:46.916]  He goes, will a self-driving car do that?
[03:19:47.076 --> 03:19:51.178]  Will they be able to program a self-driving car to make that kind of intelligent decisions?
[03:19:51.758 --> 03:20:00.142]  And as I'm visualizing this, I can see the cars starting to stack up, all these self-driving cars, too timid to go around the yellow line.
[03:20:00.443 --> 03:20:01.923]  That's only one of the problems.
[03:20:01.963 --> 03:20:07.126]  There are many problems, but of course, the same fixers that are going to fix this election are going to fix that.
[03:20:07.206 --> 03:20:08.767]  We'll tell you how that's going to happen when we come back.
[03:20:09.327 --> 03:20:13.990]  Wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, a crashing economy.
[03:20:14.150 --> 03:20:15.011]  Are you ready?

[03:24:20.620 --> 03:24:25.484]  Before we do, I want to let you know that we have a special on our new product, Anthroplex.
[03:24:25.504 --> 03:24:28.466]  And that special is going to only run until tomorrow.
[03:24:29.146 --> 03:24:32.489]  This is Anthroplex, a twice-daily pill formulation for men.
[03:24:32.849 --> 03:24:35.191]  It works synergistically with Super Male Vitality.
[03:24:35.231 --> 03:24:38.433]  And right now, we have a sale on with the duo.
[03:24:38.473 --> 03:24:41.075]  If you get the two of them together, you will save 15% and get free shipping.
[03:24:43.137 --> 03:24:56.830]  That is 15% off Supermail Vitality and Anthroplex, our new formulation, our new pill formulation that uses ingredients that are there to restore your masculine foundation, stimulate vitality.
[03:24:57.190 --> 03:25:01.554]  It's a unique blend of ingredients that works in conjunction with Supermail Vitality.
[03:25:01.574 --> 03:25:05.337]  Again, if you get the two of those together, you can get that at 15% off and free shipping.
[03:25:05.598 --> 03:25:06.819]  We also have Silver Bullet.
[03:25:07.579 --> 03:25:11.080]  Uh, 15% off, 10% additional if you get auto-ship.
[03:25:11.500 --> 03:25:13.721]  That sale ends tomorrow as well.
[03:25:13.761 --> 03:25:20.943]  So we have a sale on Silver Bullet, 15% off, as well as the pair of male ingredients, Super Male Vitality and Anthroplex.
[03:25:21.363 --> 03:25:25.624]  Uh, both of those are 15% off, and that sale ends tomorrow.
[03:25:26.404 --> 03:25:29.506]  Tonight, as I mentioned, we're going to have live coverage of the New Hampshire primary.
[03:25:29.926 --> 03:25:36.110]  That live coverage is going to begin an hour earlier than the nightly news with an auto stream on UStream.
[03:25:36.510 --> 03:25:40.192]  The Alex Jones live channel on UStream will be at the Trump Watch Party.
[03:25:40.212 --> 03:25:44.214]  And of course, we'll pick up with election results at 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:25:44.314 --> 03:25:44.634]  Eastern.
[03:25:45.255 --> 03:25:47.916]  That coverage on UStream is going to begin at 6 p.m.
[03:25:47.956 --> 03:25:49.377]  Central, 7 p.m.
[03:25:49.517 --> 03:25:52.279]  Eastern, just as the polls are closing in New Hampshire.
[03:25:53.058 --> 03:26:08.774]  As we went to break, I was talking about this article that's on the Drudge Report about why driverless cars will screech to a halt, and of course the person points out the obvious issue that we've got these massive cars that are going to be driven by computer programs, and of course that creates a big liability issue.
[03:26:08.954 --> 03:26:10.576]  Have you ever had a computer that crashed?
[03:26:11.016 --> 03:26:11.197]  Yeah.
[03:26:11.637 --> 03:26:13.959]  But you didn't die when it crashed, did you?
[03:26:14.580 --> 03:26:17.961]  Okay, I would not trust Microsoft or Google for that matter.
[03:26:17.981 --> 03:26:22.003]  I would not trust a piece of software that they wrote to drive my car.
[03:26:22.023 --> 03:26:23.984]  As a matter of fact, here's the reality.
[03:26:24.604 --> 03:26:29.746]  Anybody that has an iPhone or any of these other devices, you understand that once you buy a computer,
[03:26:30.731 --> 03:26:34.655]  And then there's new revisions of the operating system that come out down the road.
[03:26:34.755 --> 03:26:38.179]  So when you get the iPhone, yeah, everything is usually working pretty good.
[03:26:38.980 --> 03:26:44.626]  And then a year or two later, they start doing updates and things don't work as well on your computer anymore.
[03:26:44.866 --> 03:26:48.750]  Can you imagine that that's going to happen with the self-driving cars?
[03:26:49.511 --> 03:26:53.895]  When you start to get, they find out that there's some vulnerabilities and these things are big issues.
[03:26:53.935 --> 03:26:58.039]  They have to fix these vulnerabilities, these bugs in their self-driving software.
[03:26:58.319 --> 03:27:00.802]  So they're going to release an update to fix that bug.
[03:27:00.842 --> 03:27:01.522]  And what happens?
[03:27:02.083 --> 03:27:05.266]  The same thing is going to happen that happens with your iPhones.
[03:27:05.686 --> 03:27:09.049]  They're going to get far less reliable as time goes on.
[03:27:09.790 --> 03:27:11.612]  And so, is this really a good idea?
[03:27:11.672 --> 03:27:25.786]  Understand that even though we see a problem in the safety issues of this, Google and all the people who are selling us this pie-in-the-sky about self-driving cars are selling it to us, telling us that it's going to end all automobile deaths.
[03:27:26.247 --> 03:27:32.653]  Say, we have over 30,000 people a year dying in automobiles, and we are going to take that number to zero.
[03:27:33.334 --> 03:27:34.795]  Volvo is very adamant.
[03:27:35.055 --> 03:27:36.596]  Nobody's going to die in their cars.
[03:27:37.076 --> 03:27:39.077]  They've got one particular model that they're selling that on.
[03:27:39.618 --> 03:27:40.598]  Do you really believe that?
[03:27:40.998 --> 03:27:42.319]  Do they really believe that?
[03:27:42.379 --> 03:27:43.000]  That's the issue.
[03:27:43.080 --> 03:27:51.164]  Do the car companies that are telling you that their cars are going to be so safe, their self-driving cars are going to be so safe, that nobody's going to die in it, do they really believe that?
[03:27:51.725 --> 03:27:58.168]  If they did, would they be screaming bloody murder about states putting on additional safety regulations?
[03:27:58.208 --> 03:28:00.210]  Would they be going to Washington
[03:28:01.230 --> 03:28:06.413]  And getting Washington to override any state and local safety regulations.
[03:28:06.553 --> 03:28:07.434]  No, they don't believe that.
[03:28:07.794 --> 03:28:08.915]  They don't believe that they're safe.
[03:28:09.395 --> 03:28:12.617]  Their actions show that they don't believe that they're safe.
[03:28:13.317 --> 03:28:17.720]  But as this guy says, he says, I fear the government is starting to wear down.
[03:28:17.820 --> 03:28:19.641]  No, the government is not wearing down.
[03:28:19.741 --> 03:28:24.704]  The government is being bought off by the same corporations that run everything.
[03:28:24.764 --> 03:28:28.206]  The same people that wrote the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[03:28:28.866 --> 03:28:32.489]  They are also going to be writing all the rules of the road, folks.
[03:28:32.669 --> 03:28:40.596]  And they're going to be mandating vehicle-to-vehicle communication devices that you're going to have to pay for, that you're going to have to maintain, that are going to increase the cost of your car.
[03:28:40.916 --> 03:28:44.099]  They're going to also, along with that, it's going to be vehicle-to-infrastructure.
[03:28:44.479 --> 03:28:46.461]  And that's where the insurance companies are going to come in.
[03:28:46.501 --> 03:28:48.103]  That's why the insurance companies like this.
[03:28:48.483 --> 03:28:54.048]  Because they're going to be able to watch every little thing that you do and charge you for every little infraction.
[03:28:54.528 --> 03:29:03.290]  They'll elevate the risks, maybe they'll pass this information on to the government so they can write you speeding tickets, say you didn't pause long enough at the stop sign, whatever.
[03:29:04.251 --> 03:29:12.793]  But consider this, today, okay, when they tell you that this is all going to be so safe, consider this, today we had a tragedy in Bavaria, Germany.
[03:29:13.613 --> 03:29:20.475]  Nine dead, 150 injured, as two passenger trains collide head-on, head-on.
[03:29:21.334 --> 03:29:21.774]  In Germany.
[03:29:22.355 --> 03:29:22.635]  Okay?
[03:29:22.675 --> 03:29:29.339]  Now, this is a situation that is not nearly as complicated as even driving a car down the interstate highway.
[03:29:29.859 --> 03:29:32.220]  You've got trains on a rail.
[03:29:32.741 --> 03:29:35.222]  And even with that, you've got head-on collisions.
[03:29:35.282 --> 03:29:36.843]  That's not supposed to happen.
[03:29:37.203 --> 03:29:38.904]  They've been doing this for a long time.
[03:29:39.224 --> 03:29:40.805]  They've got backup systems.
[03:29:41.125 --> 03:29:45.248]  They've got very sophisticated electronics and sensors to keep all this from happening.
[03:29:45.848 --> 03:29:58.598]  And tell that to the nine dead, 150 injured, and think about it when you think you want to get into a car that they're going to drive, that the government is going to control, that they're going to use to establish a surveillance grid to tax and track you.
[03:29:58.618 --> 03:30:01.580]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.501 --> 03:30:05.183]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.409 --> 03:30:25.482]  If polls are to be believed, Hillary Clinton's once commanding national lead over Bernie Sanders appears to have evaporated in a matter of days, pointing to trouble ahead for the former Secretary of State as voters cast their ballots Tuesday in Sanders-friendly New Hampshire, reports Fox News.
[03:30:25.842 --> 03:30:34.949]  A recent Reuters poll shows Clinton leading Sanders 48 to 45, while state polls are far better indicators going into each individual primary.
[03:30:35.089 --> 03:30:37.911]  National polls help gauge the candidate's broader appeal.
[03:30:38.131 --> 03:30:49.257]  Over the past several months, Clinton has at times led the national polls by more than 30 points, contributing to her front-runner label, even as she has faced tough races in Iowa and New Hampshire.
[03:30:49.497 --> 03:31:00.664]  But Sanders may be heading for a big win in New Hampshire Tuesday night, if he can hold off Clinton, who has gotten tougher on the Vermont senator in recent days, as her husband Bill Clinton ratchets up his attacks.
[03:31:01.285 --> 03:31:03.776]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com
[03:31:10.493 --> 03:31:13.915]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:31:14.256 --> 03:31:21.380]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:31:22.001 --> 03:31:30.326]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:31:30.346 --> 03:31:34.769]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:31:35.030 --> 03:31:40.193]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[03:31:40.213 --> 03:31:40.573]  We're good.
[03:32:08.869 --> 03:32:12.072]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:32:12.372 --> 03:32:20.398]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:32:20.619 --> 03:32:25.623]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:32:26.043 --> 03:32:28.325]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[03:33:21.121 --> 03:33:25.604]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:27.045 --> 03:33:30.007]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:30.067 --> 03:33:31.908]  I'm David Knight, your host in this fourth hour.
[03:33:32.489 --> 03:33:38.112]  Before we get to election results, get back to them in New Hampshire and talk about what's happening there, about our coverage tonight.
[03:33:38.152 --> 03:33:39.814]  I want to cover some financial news here.
[03:33:39.834 --> 03:33:43.256]  Of course, we have even more volatility on Wall Street.
[03:33:43.316 --> 03:33:49.000]  It's been a bad year so far, and today, USA Today reports volatility continues to rule on Wall Street.
[03:33:49.500 --> 03:34:02.265]  Stocks are bouncing around and choppy trading today with the Dow Jones about 100 points down amid another steep drop in oil prices and global stock turmoil that saw Japanese shares fall more than 5% overnight.
[03:34:03.066 --> 03:34:08.588]  And of course, things are not going to get better if you have robot cars that lay off
[03:34:09.088 --> 03:34:13.851]  One and a half million transportation workers just in the trucking industry alone.
[03:34:13.871 --> 03:34:21.576]  Or, the other story that we didn't cover that's up on Financial Times, it was a Drudge Report link to it, robots will force experts to find other routes to the top.
[03:34:21.756 --> 03:34:27.420]  That article on Financial Times is talking about the impact on white-collar jobs.
[03:34:27.500 --> 03:34:37.407]  It isn't just going to be the factory workers, it isn't going to be the agricultural workers, the transportation workers, it's also going to be the white-collar workers that are going to be affected by this.
[03:34:38.027 --> 03:34:44.490]  This is why this particular change in the economy is so fundamentally different than any other that we've seen before.
[03:34:44.530 --> 03:34:49.032]  We've had a revolution going from an agricultural to an industrial society.
[03:34:49.512 --> 03:34:56.035]  We've seen the kinds of displacements, but they always were typically limited to one particular area at a time.
[03:34:56.135 --> 03:35:01.177]  This is going to cause massive unemployment across the full employment spectrum.
[03:35:01.298 --> 03:35:02.258]  Every type of job.
[03:35:02.518 --> 03:35:03.198]  Every type of job.
[03:35:03.218 --> 03:35:13.724]  For example, Financial Times is saying, when it comes to the future, futurists concede that few expert lawyers or consultants or accountants will still be needed.
[03:35:14.465 --> 03:35:20.728]  And even after cheaper and more efficient computer systems have taken over many of their junior partners' jobs.
[03:35:20.808 --> 03:35:22.869]  Okay, so this is going to affect everybody.
[03:35:22.889 --> 03:35:25.211]  It's going to affect analysts and managers, everyone.
[03:35:25.947 --> 03:35:35.333]  You have to understand that the globalists, and as they're looking at this, we go back and we look at what Zbigniew Brzezinski was talking about, saying that, you know, we're going to have a technocratic society.
[03:35:35.773 --> 03:35:37.174]  We don't really need that many people.
[03:35:37.194 --> 03:35:39.135]  We're going to find ways to get rid of them.
[03:35:39.956 --> 03:35:47.981]  And the globalists liked what he had to say so much back in 1970 that they made him, a couple years later, head of the Trilateral Commission.
[03:35:48.021 --> 03:35:51.043]  And if you look at the Trilateral Commission and how it broke the world,
[03:35:51.563 --> 03:35:52.104]  Yeah, I think so.
[03:36:06.707 --> 03:36:16.016]  The European Union began as a trade and economic union, and now it is trying, they're trying to move it to a political union.
[03:36:16.377 --> 03:36:17.358]  And how do they do that?
[03:36:17.938 --> 03:36:30.251]  Well, they do that by first creating the economic union, then creating economic problems, and then saying, well, because of the economic problems inside of our economic union, we're going to have to have more political control to keep this thing together.
[03:36:31.161 --> 03:36:32.041]  And that's the strategy.
[03:36:32.322 --> 03:36:33.562]  That's the way they pull it all together.
[03:36:34.102 --> 03:36:36.463]  And then they have the North American Union, European Union.
[03:36:36.924 --> 03:36:41.045]  That's why we have the Trans-Pacific, the Trans-Atlantic trade agreements.
[03:36:41.125 --> 03:36:46.408]  Understand that North America is the hinge on which the other two hang.
[03:36:46.728 --> 03:36:49.049]  We are the ones who are bringing it all together.
[03:36:49.409 --> 03:36:51.770]  We are the center of the new world order.
[03:36:51.830 --> 03:36:56.893]  We're the ones who've been taken over the most completely and the ones who've been taken over first.
[03:36:57.213 --> 03:36:59.494]  And as we look at this financial situation,
[03:37:00.404 --> 03:37:02.926]  Look at these other articles that have come out just in the last day.
[03:37:03.546 --> 03:37:08.489]  Feds may lack the legal ability to do negative interest rates.
[03:37:08.589 --> 03:37:10.710]  And this goes back to a 2010 memo.
[03:37:10.790 --> 03:37:16.994]  Folks, they've been planning this for a long time, saying they're going to put in negative interest rates, okay?
[03:37:17.294 --> 03:37:20.636]  Confiscate people's savings above a given level.
[03:37:20.696 --> 03:37:23.078]  This is something we've been warning people about for a long time.
[03:37:23.098 --> 03:37:26.100]  Everybody, oh, I haven't heard anything about that a couple of years ago.
[03:37:26.160 --> 03:37:27.961]  And then the European banks did it.
[03:37:28.832 --> 03:37:34.655]  And now we find that the American Central Bank has been planning this for at least six years.
[03:37:34.716 --> 03:37:44.401]  And of course they look at it and they say, well, you know, the law that authorized the Fed to pay interest rates on excess reserves may not grant it the authority to charge interest.
[03:37:44.441 --> 03:37:47.203]  But don't worry, we think we might be able to find a workaround.
[03:37:47.403 --> 03:37:48.664]  Yeah, just ignore it.
[03:37:49.184 --> 03:37:53.867]  Just ignore the law, just do whatever you want, just buy off some legislators, have them change it, whatever.
[03:37:54.107 --> 03:38:00.371]  There's a number of ways that they can cut this, but of course what they're going to do is they're going to start charging people negative interest rates.
[03:38:01.112 --> 03:38:09.977]  In another article, looking at the sell-off of European banks, talking about how ominous that is, they say the current environment for European banks is very, very bad over a full business cycle.
[03:38:10.018 --> 03:38:15.041]  I think it's very questionable whether banks, on average, are able to cover their cost of equity.
[03:38:15.521 --> 03:38:19.405]  As a result, that makes it an unattractive investment for long-term investors.
[03:38:19.425 --> 03:38:23.168]  That's Peter Garnery, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank.
[03:38:23.188 --> 03:38:27.092]  Now, why is it such a bad deal for people to buy banking stocks?
[03:38:27.733 --> 03:38:33.498]  Well, in the same article, they talk about negative interest rates that have been set up by the European Central Bank.
[03:38:33.979 --> 03:38:34.879]  Do you see a pattern here?
[03:38:35.600 --> 03:38:48.150]  But the central bank sets up negative interest rates and starts bankrupting the banks, bankrupting the economy, and of course all this will also be used as a push towards a cashless society.
[03:38:48.570 --> 03:38:56.176]  So the banks are getting squeezed, they're losing money because of negative interest rates, and now they're looking to do the same thing here in America.
[03:38:56.917 --> 03:38:59.358]  So let's take a look at how this system is stacked.
[03:38:59.378 --> 03:39:02.178]  We've had the first votes come in from New Hampshire.
[03:39:02.778 --> 03:39:08.200]  As I mentioned earlier, the small towns that have less than 100 people in them can begin voting at midnight.
[03:39:08.720 --> 03:39:11.960]  Once all those people have voted, they can report the votes.
[03:39:12.040 --> 03:39:14.841]  And so we have three small towns that historically do that.
[03:39:14.881 --> 03:39:18.902]  We have Dixville Notch, Mills Field, and Harts Location.
[03:39:19.898 --> 03:39:21.659]  They have now reported their results.
[03:39:21.719 --> 03:39:25.581]  Now before I tell you the results, I'll give you a little bit of a story here going back to 1992.
[03:39:26.402 --> 03:39:29.544]  I was working with the Libertarian Party.
[03:39:29.624 --> 03:39:32.405]  Our candidate there at the time was a guy named Andre Marou.
[03:39:32.465 --> 03:39:33.466]  He was out of Alaska.
[03:39:33.526 --> 03:39:36.688]  He had been elected as a state representative in Alaska.
[03:39:36.728 --> 03:39:38.369]  He was running for president.
[03:39:38.389 --> 03:39:40.610]  He had 50 state ballot access, I believe.
[03:39:40.630 --> 03:39:45.913]  He had been Ron Paul's vice presidential candidate when Ron Paul ran four years earlier in 1988 as a Libertarian.
[03:39:47.955 --> 03:39:49.881]  And, uh, an interesting thing happened.
[03:39:50.666 --> 03:39:51.546]  And Dixville Notch.
[03:39:52.426 --> 03:39:59.508]  We were watching the returns that night because we knew Dixville Notch was going to come in and we'd had some tips within the Libertarian Party.
[03:39:59.548 --> 03:40:02.548]  People said, we think we're going to get some good results out of Dixville Notch.
[03:40:03.148 --> 03:40:05.789]  And the person who won Dixville Notch was Andre Marou.
[03:40:05.829 --> 03:40:13.890]  I still remember watching the program and the newscaster says, we've got the first returns in and the winner is Andre Marou.
[03:40:13.910 --> 03:40:14.790]  He goes, who?
[03:40:16.291 --> 03:40:16.971]  Never heard of him.
[03:40:17.651 --> 03:40:18.471]  How did that happen?
[03:40:19.380 --> 03:40:22.503]  Well, the most interesting thing about that is the way that it happened.
[03:40:22.743 --> 03:40:33.012]  What they did, and the reason they thought they were going to get good results, was because an activist had given every one of the people in that tiny location a subscription to a Libertarian magazine.
[03:40:33.573 --> 03:40:34.373]  And it had an effect.
[03:40:35.282 --> 03:40:39.784]  Now there's a lesson in that, and the lesson is that we can wake people up.
[03:40:40.365 --> 03:40:41.625]  We can educate people.
[03:40:42.045 --> 03:40:49.049]  And that's what you're seeing happening with the internet, with the Drudge Report, with Infowars, with all the media that is not the mainstream media.
[03:40:49.349 --> 03:40:53.691]  You can have an effect, and we are seeing that effect in this election.
[03:40:54.271 --> 03:40:54.832]  People are saying,
[03:40:55.692 --> 03:40:56.132]  Sanders?
[03:40:56.292 --> 03:40:56.512]  Who?
[03:40:57.072 --> 03:40:57.332]  Trump?
[03:40:57.472 --> 03:40:57.672]  Who?
[03:40:57.692 --> 03:40:58.533]  Okay.
[03:40:59.293 --> 03:41:06.034]  This is the effect that we saw in a very tiny way back in Dixville Notch in 1992.
[03:41:06.614 --> 03:41:23.698]  Giving people information that they had not seen before, explaining it, backing it up, giving them the underlying information to show them what is really happening, giving them the full information that was being hidden from them by the mainstream media, taking them out of the controlled bubble.
[03:41:24.278 --> 03:41:26.779]  And I think we ought to start calling them the iWash media.
[03:41:26.799 --> 03:41:44.164]  Remember, that was that story where they were talking about iWash was originally, it's actually the intelligence community's phrase for what we would call compartmentalization, saying we're going to feed information to the lower people in the CIA or the NSA or the FBI, whatever.
[03:41:44.184 --> 03:41:49.025]  They're going to get one set of information, but the people at the top, they see what's really going to be done.
[03:41:49.065 --> 03:41:51.326]  In many cases, they're diametrically opposite
[03:41:51.826 --> 03:41:53.447]  To the information that's given to the lower people.
[03:41:53.487 --> 03:41:54.827]  You can call that compartmentalization.
[03:41:54.867 --> 03:41:56.468]  They call it eye-washing.
[03:41:56.888 --> 03:41:59.089]  You know, kind of like brainwashing, but it's eye-washing.
[03:41:59.629 --> 03:42:01.250]  We ought to call it the eye-wash media.
[03:42:01.990 --> 03:42:09.273]  And when you get the eye-wash media out of your eyes, and you can see what is really going on, it changes things.
[03:42:09.373 --> 03:42:12.254]  And so now we've got a very different election cycle.
[03:42:12.714 --> 03:42:14.775]  And it's there because of the internet.
[03:42:14.855 --> 03:42:19.077]  It's there because of the alternative media, because of the true media that's out there.
[03:42:20.029 --> 03:42:25.505]  But when you look at the results of what's going on in Dixville Notch, here's some of the results here at CNN.
[03:42:25.525 --> 03:42:27.431]  See if you guys can pull this up on the screen there.
[03:42:28.052 --> 03:42:31.493]  CNN looks at the results, and of course, you look at these three small towns.
[03:42:31.613 --> 03:42:35.833]  You've got 17 votes for Sanders, and you've got 9 votes for Clinton, okay?
[03:42:36.273 --> 03:42:38.614]  Zero percent of the voting is in, in essence, okay?
[03:42:38.634 --> 03:42:42.435]  This is a very, very small sample of these three small towns, 17 and 9.
[03:42:43.295 --> 03:42:45.795]  And when I looked at this, I thought, okay, well that's fine.
[03:42:45.875 --> 03:42:51.656]  What caught my eye, though, was when you look over to the right-hand side and you look at the number of delegates.
[03:42:52.276 --> 03:42:53.977]  So here we've got 26 people have voted.
[03:42:56.380 --> 03:42:58.503]  And Hillary Clinton has six delegates.
[03:42:59.364 --> 03:43:01.387]  And Bernie Sanders has zero.
[03:43:02.108 --> 03:43:02.969]  How did that happen?
[03:43:03.329 --> 03:43:04.931]  She's already got six delegates.
[03:43:05.352 --> 03:43:10.699]  Six out of the eight super delegates are already there for Hillary Clinton.
[03:43:11.340 --> 03:43:13.921]  Ernie Sanders has none, okay?
[03:43:13.961 --> 03:43:24.644]  Now on the Republican side, there aren't any delegates that have been awarded yet because this superdelegate situation is really a Democrat Party rigging that's going on.
[03:43:25.084 --> 03:43:28.705]  Going back to the middle of November, I want to read you an article here.
[03:43:29.365 --> 03:43:33.226]  Most New Hampshire Democrat superdelegates back Clinton.
[03:43:33.266 --> 03:43:38.068]  Now this was from a local New Hampshire paper back in the middle of November, November the 13th.
[03:43:39.008 --> 03:43:43.312]  And they said among New Hampshire's eight superdelegates, six are backing Clinton.
[03:43:43.813 --> 03:43:48.618]  The seventh, Democrat Party Chairman Ray Buckley, is prohibited from supporting anyone in the primary.
[03:43:48.958 --> 03:43:56.285]  And the eighth, State Senator Martha Fuller Clark of Portsmouth, says she may wait until after the primary to endorse.
[03:43:56.345 --> 03:44:01.390]  And they point out superdelegates can support the candidate of their choice regardless of what happens in primaries.
[03:44:02.091 --> 03:44:07.416]  Who are these privileged elite who get to choose whoever they want, okay?
[03:44:07.436 --> 03:44:13.182]  Well, it turns out they're a pretty sizable chunk of the total number of delegates.
[03:44:13.522 --> 03:44:15.744]  There are 712 superdelegates in the Democrat Party.
[03:44:15.784 --> 03:44:19.048]  That's 30% of the 2,382 delegates that you need to win the nomination.
[03:44:25.305 --> 03:44:38.321]  And they point out that two months at that point in time, two months before any voting started, Clinton at that time, back in the middle of November, already had 15% of the delegates that she needed to win.
[03:44:39.110 --> 03:44:44.915]  The AP went out and did a poll of these superdelegates, and they asked them who they were going to pick.
[03:44:45.616 --> 03:44:46.277]  Clinton got 62%.
[03:44:46.377 --> 03:44:46.697]  Sanders, 1%.
[03:44:46.797 --> 03:44:47.017]  O'Malley, 0.3%.
[03:44:47.157 --> 03:44:48.238]  And Uncommitted was 36%.
[03:44:55.385 --> 03:44:56.065]  Now think about that.
[03:44:56.345 --> 03:45:03.048]  Clinton had 62% of the superdelegates that answered the poll and 80% of them came back and answered the poll.
[03:45:03.668 --> 03:45:04.668]  Sanders only had 1%.
[03:45:05.268 --> 03:45:09.690]  That is the establishment closing behind Hillary Clinton.
[03:45:10.130 --> 03:45:15.452]  That's why Hillary Clinton thinks she can do whatever she wishes and still win this game.
[03:45:16.172 --> 03:45:18.153]  It's because of the establishment backing her.
[03:45:18.453 --> 03:45:22.035]  The same thing happens in more subtle ways in the Republican Party.
[03:45:22.315 --> 03:45:24.436]  Now, again, who are these people?
[03:45:24.536 --> 03:45:28.098]  Who are these people that get to pick the president in the Democrat Party?
[03:45:29.119 --> 03:45:32.160]  Well, they are people who are elected officials.
[03:45:32.560 --> 03:45:33.901]  They're superdelegates automatically.
[03:45:34.827 --> 03:45:35.087]  I think so.
[03:45:53.306 --> 03:45:56.208]  Now, in the Republican Party, there also are superdelegates.
[03:45:56.708 --> 03:46:00.491]  These are typically only, though, three per state.
[03:46:00.531 --> 03:46:05.654]  So maybe about 150 versus the over 750 that the Democrats have.
[03:46:06.115 --> 03:46:12.839]  So there's about five times as many of them in the Democrat Party as there are in the Republican Party.
[03:46:12.939 --> 03:46:21.005]  And in the Republican Party, the superdelegates are RNC committee members, two of those, as well as the state chair of the RNC.
[03:46:21.045 --> 03:46:22.225]  That's how the establishment
[03:46:23.546 --> 03:46:25.547]  Starts to put this stuff together.
[03:46:26.067 --> 03:46:30.609]  Now, of course, there's other games that are played in the GOP in terms of picking delegates.
[03:46:30.709 --> 03:46:36.692]  They are not as straightforward and honest as that may appear to be when you just look at the superdelegate thing.
[03:46:36.712 --> 03:46:46.376]  They have a lot of different ways that they can play with the delegates, and that's what they're talking about when they talk about a brokered convention, something that we used to see happening all the time.
[03:46:47.176 --> 03:46:53.982]  I find it interesting, too, as we look through this statement by Bill as he's thumping for Hillary Clinton.
[03:46:54.022 --> 03:46:55.263]  Again, this was on the Drudge Report.
[03:46:55.283 --> 03:46:57.786]  Sometimes I wish we weren't married, he says.
[03:46:58.146 --> 03:47:01.689]  Sometimes when I'm on a stage like this, I wish that we weren't married.
[03:47:02.069 --> 03:47:04.552]  Then I could say what I really think, said Bill Clinton.
[03:47:04.992 --> 03:47:06.893]  He says, I don't mean that in a negative way.
[03:47:06.913 --> 03:47:07.653]  I'm happy.
[03:47:07.833 --> 03:47:08.894]  Really, I am, dear.
[03:47:08.914 --> 03:47:18.758]  He says, the hotter this election gets, the more I wish I was just a former president and just for a few months, not the spouse of the next one because, you know, I have to be careful what I say.
[03:47:18.778 --> 03:47:26.541]  Yeah, he has to be very careful what he says because, you know, Hillary has a really bad temper and she tends to throw things.
[03:47:26.921 --> 03:47:28.542]  We've seen that happening before.
[03:47:29.142 --> 03:47:42.548]  Now, when you look on the Republican side, of course, one of the ways that this is rigged, and we've talked about this a great deal, I mentioned at the very beginning about the effect of the alternative media, about people being able to get information on the Internet.
[03:47:43.464 --> 03:47:51.046]  We see that the mainstream media, especially on the Republican side, Fox News is the 800-pound elephant.
[03:47:51.086 --> 03:47:56.627]  They still have tremendous sway to manipulate the GOP voters.
[03:47:57.507 --> 03:48:03.149]  Look at this article that was on WND with Megyn Kelly asking, does Donald Trump want to shoot me?
[03:48:04.158 --> 03:48:06.599]  How's that for fair and balanced, you know?
[03:48:06.619 --> 03:48:08.739]  I mean, it is just absolutely amazing.
[03:48:09.239 --> 03:48:19.202]  Remember that when she started, and this is what started the whole feud between her and Donald Trump, she says, you once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice that it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees.
[03:48:19.222 --> 03:48:23.263]  Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man that we should elect as president?
[03:48:23.903 --> 03:48:26.765]  You are part of the war on women, she implied.
[03:48:26.885 --> 03:48:27.366]  Okay, really?
[03:48:27.766 --> 03:48:30.188]  Is he really part of the war on women?
[03:48:30.888 --> 03:48:32.089]  How's that for fair and balanced?
[03:48:32.470 --> 03:48:33.851]  She doubled down on this, okay?
[03:48:34.611 --> 03:48:48.782]  She goes on television and on a talk show, she says, well, the only thing I really want to ask Donald Trump was, he recently said his supporters are so devoted to him that he could go in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and he wouldn't lose a single voter.
[03:48:49.142 --> 03:48:51.945]  And in response, I want to ask him, were you talking about me?
[03:48:52.779 --> 03:48:56.161]  And then she smiled and said, well, I never go to Fifth Avenue anymore.
[03:48:57.522 --> 03:48:59.102]  Never ends with Megyn Kelly.
[03:48:59.543 --> 03:49:07.927]  I guess, is she really a news person or is this all just about Megyn Kelly, the celebrity journalist?
[03:49:09.028 --> 03:49:10.689]  But they're still pushing Marco Rubio.
[03:49:11.369 --> 03:49:18.013]  And as I mentioned before, Fox News is still saying that they see him at 15% and second place to Donald Trump.
[03:49:18.394 --> 03:49:21.936]  Let's play a clip that we had earlier of Chris Christie.
[03:49:21.956 --> 03:49:25.818]  This is one that we had not played in the beginning of the clip.
[03:49:25.838 --> 03:49:27.720]  The one with Christie and the restaurant.
[03:49:27.740 --> 03:49:28.420]  You guys got that ready?
[03:49:28.440 --> 03:49:29.100]  Yeah, let's play that.
[03:49:29.141 --> 03:49:32.823]  What he said, continuing to talk about Marco Rubio the robot.
[03:49:33.951 --> 03:49:37.112]  The biggest attacker in this race has been Marco Rubio.
[03:49:37.492 --> 03:49:42.472]  He puts that little smile on his face, and then he sends his super pack out to cut people's throats.
[03:49:43.093 --> 03:49:45.293]  We don't need another duplicitous Washington, D.C.
[03:49:45.333 --> 03:49:47.233]  politician in the White House.
[03:49:47.533 --> 03:49:48.193]  We already have one.
[03:49:48.453 --> 03:49:49.274]  We don't need another one.
[03:49:49.914 --> 03:49:53.134]  Marco needs to go get some experience, and when he does, maybe he can run for president again.
[03:49:53.354 --> 03:49:55.955]  He's a typical Washington drive-by politician.
[03:49:56.335 --> 03:50:01.056]  No experience, but a lot of talking points that he just got from his op research guys.
[03:50:01.416 --> 03:50:03.676]  Is there anything that Marco says that he doesn't get from his staff?
[03:50:04.218 --> 03:50:06.859]  And it's not just a super PAC that's going to go out and cut people's throats.
[03:50:07.019 --> 03:50:11.181]  It's people like Megyn Kelly and Fox News that will go out and cut his opponent's throats.
[03:50:11.481 --> 03:50:19.105]  Now, when she tried to paint Donald Trump as part of the war on women, I think it's very interesting to see what has happened in the last couple of days.
[03:50:19.165 --> 03:50:21.566]  We've got this article here on Politico.
[03:50:21.626 --> 03:50:25.248]  Bill Clinton's bimbos are flocking to Team Trump.
[03:50:25.288 --> 03:50:28.869]  And they point out at an Arkansas rally last week, Paula Jones was there.
[03:50:29.390 --> 03:50:32.071]  She posed for a picture with Donald Trump.
[03:50:32.871 --> 03:50:37.575]  And then we've also got Kathleen Willey, who did talk about the war on women.
[03:50:37.635 --> 03:50:41.739]  Remember, Kathleen Willey came out and said Hillary Clinton is the war on women.
[03:50:41.979 --> 03:50:43.861]  Hillary is the war on women.
[03:50:44.201 --> 03:50:46.644]  She's going to be part of a super PAC.
[03:50:47.184 --> 03:50:49.706]  This PAC is called the RAPE PAC.
[03:50:50.467 --> 03:50:51.808]  by Roger Stone.
[03:50:51.848 --> 03:50:52.709]  He's putting that together.
[03:50:52.769 --> 03:51:00.877]  Kathleen Willey is going to be a spokesperson, and they are not going to let people forget what Bill and Hillary did to women.
[03:51:00.937 --> 03:51:09.505]  That's the true war on women, and we're about to have a real war in this campaign between Donald Trump and between Hillary Clinton.
[03:51:09.525 --> 03:51:09.865]  Stay with us.
[03:51:09.885 --> 03:51:10.326]  We'll be right back.

[03:52:33.236 --> 03:52:40.161]  Brain Force is here.
[03:52:40.341 --> 03:52:42.462]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:52:42.542 --> 03:52:47.305]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[03:52:47.545 --> 03:52:50.687]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:52:50.828 --> 03:52:54.050]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:52:54.310 --> 03:52:56.011]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:52:56.291 --> 03:52:57.191]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[03:52:57.211 --> 03:52:58.152]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[03:52:58.412 --> 03:53:00.292]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[03:53:00.392 --> 03:53:05.534]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:53:05.554 --> 03:53:07.415]  Are you sneezing, coughing, and aching?
[03:53:12.336 --> 03:53:15.057]  Do you have a sore throat, a fever, or the sniffles?
[03:53:15.517 --> 03:53:20.880]  There's no reason to be sick this cold and flu season with immune system support from Supernatural Silver.

[03:53:59.302 --> 03:54:00.683]  We're good to go.
[03:54:15.347 --> 03:54:16.607]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:16.627 --> 03:54:18.808]  We're going to take a quick look at a couple of the other candidates.
[03:54:18.848 --> 03:54:20.949]  We've been talking about Rubio and Cruz.
[03:54:21.049 --> 03:54:26.530]  I want to go back and rather, Trump, we're going to talk about Cruz and Jeb for just a moment.
[03:54:26.570 --> 03:54:30.791]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to let you know about a couple of specials that are going to be ending tomorrow.
[03:54:30.831 --> 03:54:32.192]  We have Silver Bullet 15% off.
[03:54:33.672 --> 03:54:36.716]  And of course, you also get 10% off if you get auto-shipped.
[03:54:36.776 --> 03:54:37.677]  That ends tomorrow.
[03:54:38.098 --> 03:54:44.647]  We have our new product, AnthroPlex, the twice-daily pill formulation for men that works synergistically with Supermail Vitality.
[03:54:44.947 --> 03:54:48.011]  We have those two being offered together, 15% off plus free shipping.
[03:54:51.095 --> 03:54:53.397]  Think about auto ship for your supplies.
[03:54:53.557 --> 03:55:04.504]  If we have, if you get auto ship on your supplies, every time you choose it at Infowarslife.com, you get 10% off and you won't have to worry about running out the next time and reordering.
[03:55:04.844 --> 03:55:09.387]  You'll be able to get it on schedule so you don't run out as we run out of stock.
[03:55:09.407 --> 03:55:10.688]  We'll set that aside for you.
[03:55:10.908 --> 03:55:12.890]  So you'd be guaranteed to get a shipment on that.
[03:55:12.950 --> 03:55:16.952]  Plus you will get 10% off when you choose auto ship.
[03:55:17.012 --> 03:55:18.313]  So again, Silver Bullet, 15% off.
[03:55:19.874 --> 03:55:24.919]  The Anthroplex Super Male Vitality Special, 15% off both of those specials and tomorrow.
[03:55:25.499 --> 03:55:29.263]  And you have the additional 10% off if you choose AutoShip.
[03:55:29.543 --> 03:55:31.304]  That's all at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:55:33.280 --> 03:55:37.062]  One of the things that I came across today that my wife sent me is very troubling.
[03:55:37.102 --> 03:55:39.303]  I haven't had time to look at the actual bill itself.
[03:55:39.323 --> 03:55:42.844]  This goes back to February the 3rd and this is the Marshall Report.
[03:55:43.465 --> 03:55:49.887]  They say Cruz legislation attacks homeschooling and lockstep with the UN's One World Education.
[03:55:49.907 --> 03:55:50.788]  And what they're saying here
[03:55:51.668 --> 03:55:54.531]  Is that he's part of this federal education choice.
[03:55:54.571 --> 03:56:00.095]  He's added some amendments to a bill that was originally put out by Senator Messer.
[03:56:00.976 --> 03:56:03.338]  And they feel that it's very deceptive.
[03:56:03.398 --> 03:56:11.985]  Because what it does is it means that if you choose to homeschool, your homeschooling will now fall under the classification of a private school.
[03:56:12.685 --> 03:56:16.451]  And it will bring in all of the federal regulations that are included on that.
[03:56:16.471 --> 03:56:20.397]  Of course, they're going to offer it to you initially as benefits.
[03:56:20.557 --> 03:56:21.899]  We're going to give you some funding.
[03:56:22.520 --> 03:56:27.747]  That is a trap that homeschoolers have been offered over and over again in various states.
[03:56:28.408 --> 03:56:36.790]  We'll give you some funding for your home schooling because, you know, you're having to pay taxes, property taxes, to support the school whether you own your own home or whether you're renting a home.
[03:56:37.030 --> 03:56:38.591]  You still have to pay property taxes.
[03:56:38.651 --> 03:56:41.972]  All those property taxes are going to the government's schools.
[03:56:42.352 --> 03:56:43.752]  So let us help you a little bit.
[03:56:43.792 --> 03:56:46.953]  We'll give you some money for your child's education.
[03:56:47.473 --> 03:56:50.917]  But when they give that to you, beware of the strings that come attached.
[03:56:51.438 --> 03:57:07.615]  As they're pointing out with this, if you get classified as a private school, and if you get the Title I funding that was added by Senator Cruz, then what happens is, your school, your private school, that's what they're going to call your home school,
[03:57:08.075 --> 03:57:18.303]  If you accept those funds, if you allow them to classify you as a private school and get the Title I funding, then what that means is that you're going to now be subject to Common Core mandates.
[03:57:18.963 --> 03:57:24.507]  You're also going to see a lot of other regulations that are going to come that way.
[03:57:25.308 --> 03:57:27.970]  And so that's one of the things that concerns me about Ted Cruz.
[03:57:28.010 --> 03:57:31.372]  I've got to say that from the very beginning I felt that he is one of the most
[03:57:32.253 --> 03:57:34.516]  Sneaky and underhanded people I have ever seen.
[03:57:34.536 --> 03:57:36.017]  That's just my personal opinion of him.
[03:57:36.418 --> 03:57:37.979]  I never felt like I could trust him.
[03:57:38.560 --> 03:57:46.748]  And when I saw what he did to Ben Carson in the Iowa caucus, that just underscored my gut feeling about this man.
[03:57:47.469 --> 03:57:49.350]  I don't know who this guy is, quite frankly.
[03:57:49.751 --> 03:57:56.335]  He's somebody who is not anywhere even remotely eligible to run for president, in my understanding of the Constitution.
[03:57:56.895 --> 03:57:58.256]  He's a Canadian citizen.
[03:57:58.857 --> 03:57:59.697]  He's a globalist.
[03:57:59.737 --> 03:58:06.862]  His wife works with Goldman Sachs, works with the CFR, doing a study about the North American Union.
[03:58:06.902 --> 03:58:09.584]  Maybe he is the North American Union president.
[03:58:10.025 --> 03:58:12.731]  Who wants to come in and, you know, we've got the North American Union.
[03:58:13.052 --> 03:58:17.864]  Why can't somebody from Canada or Mexico be the President of the United States?
[03:58:18.245 --> 03:58:18.927]  I guess they can.
[03:58:19.659 --> 03:58:20.540]  Well, join us tonight.
[03:58:20.600 --> 03:58:24.083]  We're going to have live coverage of the New Hampshire primary results.
[03:58:24.163 --> 03:58:26.685]  That's going to begin at 7 central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:26.745 --> 03:58:27.927]  Eastern with the Nightly News crew.
[03:58:27.967 --> 03:58:33.031]  But even before that, we're going to begin streaming on the Alex Jones Live Channel on Ustream.
[03:58:33.071 --> 03:58:37.936]  We'll stream the Trump Watch Party live out of New Hampshire, beginning at 6 p.m.
[03:58:37.976 --> 03:58:39.277]  Central and 7 p.m.
[03:58:39.377 --> 03:58:39.717]  Eastern.
[03:58:39.797 --> 03:58:40.298]  Join us then.
