[00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:22.721]  It's December 15th, 2016.
[00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:26.805]  I'm Owen Schroer, and here's what's coming up on the InfoWars Nightly News Tonight.
[00:00:29.848 --> 00:00:30.189]  Tonight.
[00:00:31.383 --> 00:00:34.825]  We covered Sheriff Arpaio's press conference that concluded just hours ago.
[00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:40.548]  They found the source document that reveals the document released by Obama is a forgery.
[00:00:40.828 --> 00:00:41.628]  We'll have the details.
[00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.051]  And, as Trump's cabinet is forming, the latest line of attack is that it's racist.
[00:00:47.512 --> 00:00:48.612]  Because it's too white.
[00:00:49.272 --> 00:00:49.733]  Wait a minute.
[00:00:49.913 --> 00:00:51.814]  Obama had a lot of white people in his cabinet.
[00:00:52.134 --> 00:00:56.436]  As usual, it's just division and diversion masquerading as diversity.
[00:00:56.836 --> 00:00:59.158]  Next they'll tell us the white people are Russian agents.
[00:00:59.997 --> 00:01:03.599]  Then we reveal that Alex Jones is a Russian agent.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.382]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.347 --> 00:01:36.952]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.
[00:01:37.052 --> 00:01:44.718]  We're making freedom go viral, and now we are proud to announce a new weapon in the epic battle against the globalists.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.765]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are kicking fake news's butt today.
[00:03:08.145 --> 00:03:12.389]  First, it comes out that Barack Obama's birth certificate appears to be forged.
[00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.111]  Shocking conspiracy theorists are right there.
[00:03:15.452 --> 00:03:21.517]  And then, Julian Assange making statements that Russia is not responsible for the WikiLeaks.
[00:03:21.577 --> 00:03:26.682]  And of course, we'll have all that and plenty more for you tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News, but I'd like to start out
[00:03:27.662 --> 00:03:33.587]  With a sad story, and this is real news that the dictator of North Korea, I'm sure, did not want to get out.
[00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:35.368]  This is from a mirror.
[00:03:35.508 --> 00:03:43.353]  Child chain gangs of North Korea exposed as kids as young as five are forced to repair railways.
[00:03:44.054 --> 00:03:45.695]  And you can see some of these images.
[00:03:45.735 --> 00:03:48.297]  They are very sad, very disturbing images.
[00:03:48.457 --> 00:03:50.759]  Kids being forced into hard labor.
[00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:55.967]  And my question is, where are the social justice warriors?
[00:03:56.107 --> 00:03:58.231]  Where is the UN?
[00:03:58.431 --> 00:04:00.134]  Where is the liberal news?
[00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:01.296]  Where is Obama?
[00:04:03.325 --> 00:04:06.607]  You know, I recall North Korea threatening the U.S.
[00:04:06.967 --> 00:04:11.991]  nuclear threats, and Obama said he would, you know, be a tough guy in responding to those.
[00:04:12.831 --> 00:04:21.457]  Nothing from Obama, and now we've got children being forced into hard labor in North Korea repairing these railways.
[00:04:22.258 --> 00:04:24.439]  Very disturbing footage and images coming from them.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.261]  And again, I ask, where's the liberal media?
[00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:28.942]  Where are the social justice warriors?
[00:04:29.162 --> 00:04:31.264]  Where is President Obama?
[00:04:31.784 --> 00:04:40.752]  Now, other sad images we are seeing coming out of Aleppo as children are begging to be rescued in a heartbreaking video from a bombed out Syrian city.
[00:04:41.352 --> 00:04:46.157]  Now, let's remember, who was it that called for Assad to step down?
[00:04:46.237 --> 00:04:50.040]  Who was it that called for Assad to be removed from power?
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.022]  That was the Obama administration.
[00:04:52.082 --> 00:04:53.403]  That was Hillary Clinton.
[00:04:53.703 --> 00:04:55.104]  And now what are we seeing?
[00:04:55.985 --> 00:04:58.946]  Now it looks like Syria is coming back.
[00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:01.667]  The Assad regime is taking ISIS out.
[00:05:02.327 --> 00:05:05.268]  And of course, this is why Assad needs to go apparently.
[00:05:05.348 --> 00:05:08.989]  Assad needs to be removed from power because he's helping get ISIS out of there.
[00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:12.130]  Again, I'm not building up Assad as the good guy or the bad guy.
[00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.911]  I'm just trying to report on what we're seeing.
[00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:21.313]  It is sad to see these kids now begging these orphans to be taken out of this city that has been bombed out.
[00:05:21.873 --> 00:05:26.355]  And again, you have to wonder, who is it that's calling for Assad to be removed from power?
[00:05:26.675 --> 00:05:27.755]  Where are those people now?
[00:05:28.215 --> 00:05:36.538]  And what is the Assad regime doing for Syria, for the people of Syria that don't want to be violent rebels like they have in ISIS?
[00:05:36.578 --> 00:05:38.859]  Now, this is a story out of Yahoo.
[00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:42.300]  Artificial intelligence creeps into daily life.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.600]  Now,
[00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:48.579]  Most of us already are aware that artificial intelligence is in our daily lives.
[00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:53.222]  If you see personalized ads when you browse the internet, you know that.
[00:05:53.582 --> 00:05:58.705]  When you see your GPS acting in real time with certain apps, you can see that.
[00:05:59.065 --> 00:06:06.289]  When you see the facial recognition technology built into Snapchat and other apps, you are aware of this.
[00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:16.836]  But now Mark Zuckerberg envisions a software system inspired by the Iron Man character Jarvis as a virtual butler managing his household.
[00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:37.086]  Now I remember a certain Disney movie growing up it was called Smart House and basically it's you know the smart house you could pretty much imagine what the smart house would be like and in that movie the smart house goes completely haywire basically traps the family in and they have to shut the smart house down.
[00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:38.987]  No surprise there.
[00:06:39.387 --> 00:06:43.709]  Now you've got automated restaurants opening in New York City.
[00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:47.071]  So you've got your smart phone, you've got your smart house, you've got your smart car.
[00:06:47.411 --> 00:06:48.872]  Now you've got your smart bar.
[00:06:49.152 --> 00:06:51.973]  The problem is what you've got is a bunch of dumb humans.
[00:06:52.394 --> 00:06:56.015]  There are no cashiers and you order on an iPad or your phone.
[00:06:56.135 --> 00:06:57.856]  The meal appears in a little locker.
[00:06:57.976 --> 00:07:00.378]  Customers tap to open the door for their meal.
[00:07:01.178 --> 00:07:05.702]  You better love the vegetarian menu and the bowls cost about $7.
[00:07:06.282 --> 00:07:08.944]  So there's your $15 an hour folks.
[00:07:09.585 --> 00:07:11.726]  You won't have a job.
[00:07:12.407 --> 00:07:13.768]  It's going to be a machine.
[00:07:13.828 --> 00:07:17.891]  That's your smart bar for dumb people.
[00:07:18.232 --> 00:07:20.473]  And now of course they want the smart internet.
[00:07:20.874 --> 00:07:23.736]  And they've always said they want to model this after the Chinese model.
[00:07:24.236 --> 00:07:28.420]  Now China takes action on thousands of websites for harmful and obscene
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:36.447]  Content China has shut down or dealt with thousands of websites for sharing harmful, erotic, or obscene content since April.
[00:07:36.467 --> 00:07:41.271]  The state's office for combating pornography and illegal publications announced Thursday.
[00:07:41.551 --> 00:07:42.612]  That's the key here for me.
[00:07:42.732 --> 00:07:44.274]  Illegal publications.
[00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:48.037]  Uh, pornography, you know what, whatever they want to do with that, that's their own deal.
[00:07:48.418 --> 00:07:51.921]  But when they start censoring news, that's when we really take note of it.
[00:07:51.961 --> 00:07:59.429]  The government has tightened its grip on Chinese cyberspace in recent months, in particular placing new restrictions on the fast-growing live-streaming industry.
[00:07:59.789 --> 00:08:03.793]  Two popular news websites were also punished for spreading illegal content.
[00:08:05.248 --> 00:08:11.153]  Social media platforms have become a key tool for spreading illegal content and has allowed individuals to make big profits.
[00:08:11.233 --> 00:08:11.933]  Wait a second.
[00:08:12.414 --> 00:08:12.834]  Hold on.
[00:08:12.954 --> 00:08:15.036]  I'm starting to sound, that sounds familiar.
[00:08:15.456 --> 00:08:17.417]  That's what they say about Alex Jones.
[00:08:17.437 --> 00:08:19.159]  That's what they say about InfoWars.
[00:08:19.459 --> 00:08:20.480]  We're fake news.
[00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:27.345]  You know, we're spreading all of this content that's drumming up controversy and we're making profit off of doing it.
[00:08:27.805 --> 00:08:28.386]  Unbelievable.
[00:08:28.446 --> 00:08:29.607]  But what did they say?
[00:08:29.667 --> 00:08:31.668]  They want to bring in Chinese style censorship.
[00:08:32.649 --> 00:08:38.391]  Now we're seeing what the Chinese are doing with their censorship and even having this internet social score.
[00:08:38.931 --> 00:08:40.272]  This is what they want to bring here.
[00:08:40.372 --> 00:08:46.594]  And we're starting to see the rhetoric filter in or get in to our rhetoric in the United States.
[00:08:46.614 --> 00:08:48.435]  We need to cut this off at the head, folks.
[00:08:48.715 --> 00:08:51.236]  We know who the real fake news is.
[00:08:51.776 --> 00:08:53.156]  And I've always said this.
[00:08:53.196 --> 00:09:00.319]  And before I get into the Business Insider story, it should be up to the end user to decide what's real and what's fake.
[00:09:01.059 --> 00:09:02.520]  See, that's the whole point of America.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.943]  Why do I need to go to Big Brother to tell me what to do?
[00:09:06.283 --> 00:09:13.608]  It's just like what John Rappaport talked today about the SB18, this bill in California that basically wants to put the state in charge of children.
[00:09:14.068 --> 00:09:16.610]  No, the parents should have the final say.
[00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:24.595]  I'm sick of these totalitarian power grabs that just determine that the state is always going to have your best interest in mind.
[00:09:24.715 --> 00:09:25.796]  I don't buy that for a second.
[00:09:25.836 --> 00:09:29.579]  But now, Facebook is going to use Snopes, Snopes.
[00:09:30.464 --> 00:09:33.509]  And other fact-checkers to combat and bury fake news.
[00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:42.826]  Facebook is going to start fact-checking, labeling, and burying fake news and hoaxes in its news feed, its company said on Thursday.
[00:09:43.703 --> 00:09:50.250]  Well, this is another accurate prediction of the fake news, which is what we're being dubbed.
[00:09:50.751 --> 00:09:58.880]  What I think they're going to do here, and we've had other people talk about this too, and they're going to use Facebook, Twitter, and I guess they're going to use Snopes.
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:04.567]  I mean, that discredits them, but they're going to use these social media platforms to verify what's real and what's fake.
[00:10:04.907 --> 00:10:11.831]  Now, we're about to have a report from John Bowne talking about Donald Trump's cabinet, and I'll be talking about that later on in the news as well.
[00:10:11.871 --> 00:10:12.952]  But here's some of the headlines.
[00:10:13.352 --> 00:10:15.654]  Dollar climbs to strongest since 2003.
[00:10:15.814 --> 00:10:19.416]  The Dolly rallied to its strongest level since 2003, up 1.2% on the euro, up 1.4%
[00:10:23.218 --> 00:10:26.420]  On the yen, gold tumbled to a 10-month low.
[00:10:26.941 --> 00:10:28.562]  Also, keep an eye on that.
[00:10:28.622 --> 00:10:31.984]  Stocks rise as Dow nears 20,000.
[00:10:32.124 --> 00:10:33.505]  Financials gain more than 1%.
[00:10:34.426 --> 00:10:36.668]  Stocks are on the rise again on Thursday.
[00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:40.450]  They keep setting records, night in, day in, day out.
[00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.712]  The records keep hitting the stock market.
[00:10:43.472 --> 00:10:45.254]  Homebuilder sediments spike 7 points.
[00:10:45.294 --> 00:10:46.675]  Trump has them feeling fantastic.
[00:10:46.915 --> 00:10:49.477]  That's part of the American dream, to build your own home.
[00:10:49.497 --> 00:10:49.797]  But wait!
[00:10:50.057 --> 00:10:51.178]  I thought this was all fake news.
[00:10:51.198 --> 00:10:54.279]  They told you that the market was going to collapse, the economy would be collapsing.
[00:10:54.319 --> 00:10:56.800]  No, Trump has Trumpified the economy up.
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:05.144]  Here are President-elect Donald Trump's picks for his presidential cabinet and top administration jobs.
[00:11:05.504 --> 00:11:11.807]  It would be important, I think, that we express some of our interest in seeing how immigration is
[00:11:12.927 --> 00:11:17.050]  We worked our tails off to develop every fact we could.
[00:11:29.719 --> 00:11:30.099]  We're good to go.
[00:11:46.093 --> 00:11:55.059]  At some point, you just can't cut costs anymore, and therefore you ultimately need pricing power and physical volume growth.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.562]  And I think that's what's really lacking in today's world.
[00:11:59.903 --> 00:12:04.386]  Since World War II, we've entered probably five major conflicts.
[00:12:05.506 --> 00:12:07.527]  Four of those did not turn out well.
[00:12:07.547 --> 00:12:21.974]  If you don't know how to end the war, the war will go on and on, the enemy will mutate, and the American people will understandably lose an appreciation for what it is they're fighting for, because it's not well articulated.
[00:12:22.634 --> 00:12:30.058]  So if you don't get the political end state right up front, you're going to be engaged in a war you don't know how to end in favorable terms.
[00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:38.751]  Letting states set their own high standards and finally putting an end to the Federalized Common Core.
[00:12:40.586 --> 00:12:56.197]  Why is it that the EPA presently is in the process of developing a uniform federal implementation plan that they're going to put on the shelf to then say to the states, unless you act a particular way, unless you act consistent with the rule, this is what you're going to get.
[00:12:56.217 --> 00:13:00.080]  That, to me, does not sound like cooperation.
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.001]  That does not sound like partnership.
[00:13:02.061 --> 00:13:04.623]  That sounds like the proverbial gun to the head.
[00:13:05.303 --> 00:13:10.684]  We voted to repeal the President's healthcare legislation very early in this Congress.
[00:13:11.164 --> 00:13:13.985]  Now, if I had my druthers, we'd vote to repeal it every single week.
[00:13:14.385 --> 00:13:15.045]  Many were injured.
[00:13:16.226 --> 00:13:17.226]  Some seriously injured.
[00:13:18.766 --> 00:13:30.329]  But as one of the Iraqis said to me, Sir, they'd run from the danger like any normal man would to save his life.
[00:13:31.971 --> 00:13:38.096]  What he didn't know until then, he said, and what he learned at that instant, was that Americans are not normal.
[00:13:40.178 --> 00:13:47.844]  With tears welling up, he said to me, Sir, in the name of Allah, no sane man would have stood there and done what they did.
[00:13:49.106 --> 00:13:49.846]  No sane man.
[00:13:50.967 --> 00:13:52.368]  They saved all of us.
[00:13:53.489 --> 00:13:56.412]  I'm here today because I believe in the rule of law.
[00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.395]  And I'm here today because I did the right thing.
[00:14:09.022 --> 00:14:19.132]  I'm going to enter this courthouse with my head held high, knowing the actions that I took were not only lawful and legal, but right.
[00:14:19.152 --> 00:14:25.358]  You know, the problem with President Obama was we started with somebody at the top who really had no idea what it took to run something.
[00:14:25.438 --> 00:14:27.079]  Donald Trump is just the opposite.
[00:14:27.359 --> 00:14:29.361]  It is going to be so critical right now.
[00:14:30.022 --> 00:14:33.505]  We must resist the temptation to take the easy way out.
[00:14:34.526 --> 00:14:40.890]  And to passively accept what is fed to us by the politically elite and the media.
[00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.291]  Because they don't know what they're talking about.
[00:14:43.451 --> 00:14:50.235]  To be the CEO of a publicly traded company, there are leadership skills, management skills, certainly fiscal responsibility.
[00:14:50.455 --> 00:14:53.757]  And those are skills that I think are lacking in Washington.
[00:14:53.777 --> 00:14:54.397]  Yeah.
[00:14:54.497 --> 00:14:56.198]  I don't think we can spend our way out of debt.
[00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:59.240]  I think we have to bring the debt down and stop the spending we're doing.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.682]  And someone with business experience has a better shot at that.
[00:15:02.782 --> 00:15:09.733]  All these energy gains and our economic dynamism are at risk if we fail to seize this historic moment.
[00:15:09.933 --> 00:15:15.963]  We have no reason to keep policies in place that reflect an age of scarcity and fear.
[00:15:16.428 --> 00:15:27.639]  Basically Mitch's opponents, his left-wing opponents, can't defeat him on policy issues and so they resort to racial slurs and questioning his patriotism because he's married to me.
[00:15:27.979 --> 00:15:30.101]  Our number one priority is tax reform.
[00:15:30.382 --> 00:15:33.945]  We're going to cut corporate taxes which will bring huge amounts of jobs.
[00:15:34.085 --> 00:15:38.830]  We're going to get to 15% and we're going to bring a lot of cash back into the U.S.
[00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.352]  I want to say a few words about President Obama.
[00:15:41.532 --> 00:15:46.656]  We are facing the most dangerous terrorist threat our nation has seen since September 11th.
[00:15:47.437 --> 00:15:52.681]  And this president appears unwilling or unable to deal with it.
[00:15:53.602 --> 00:15:57.405]  President Obama and Hillary Clinton abandoned Iraq.
[00:15:58.506 --> 00:16:05.892]  President Obama and Hillary Clinton drew a red line in Syria and then refused to uphold it.
[00:16:07.179 --> 00:16:16.277]  President Obama and Hillary Clinton watched passively as China and Russia filled the international leadership vacuum that they created.
[00:16:17.694 --> 00:16:22.237]  As of today, four cabinet positions are still being decided on.
[00:16:22.478 --> 00:16:33.726]  That of the Director of National Intelligence, Agriculture Secretary, Secretary of Veteran Affairs, and the person that will embody Donald Trump's chief trade negotiator, the U.S.
[00:16:34.026 --> 00:16:35.227]  Trade Representative.
[00:16:35.507 --> 00:16:41.592]  Of course, the minions of the propaganda machine voiced a chorus of their disapproval.
[00:16:41.752 --> 00:16:48.934]  We have to compare this, again to use John Cleese's line, this crew of a governmental pirate ship to Batman villains.
[00:16:49.374 --> 00:16:50.354]  All Batman villains.
[00:16:50.434 --> 00:16:57.616]  And this morning, Rex Tillerson could also be the first Secretary of State in American history with zero government experience.
[00:16:57.976 --> 00:17:02.938]  The ExxonMobil CEO is now Trump's likely pick to be the nation's top diplomat.
[00:17:03.298 --> 00:17:06.819]  And already his business ties with Russia are raising concerns.
[00:17:07.279 --> 00:17:18.006]  He nominated a wealthy CEO with ties to Russian oligarchs, and Tillerson is just the latest addition to a cabinet full of millionaires and billionaires that was already worth a total of $14 billion.
[00:17:18.066 --> 00:17:20.408]  Trump continues to fill out his cabinet.
[00:17:21.049 --> 00:17:25.672]  Watching Trump pick these people is like watching your nana get a sponge bath.
[00:17:27.293 --> 00:17:30.095]  You know it has to be done, but it's still upsetting.
[00:17:33.026 --> 00:17:43.354]  Yesterday, Trump named Scott Pruitt, Oklahoma Attorney General and sworn enemy of the EPA to be the head of... What's the word?
[00:17:43.634 --> 00:17:44.415]  The EPA.
[00:17:46.496 --> 00:17:54.707]  Appointing Andrew Puzder to run the agency responsible for protecting workers is a slap in the face for every hardworking American family.
[00:17:55.187 --> 00:18:02.477]  And this from Senator Tim Kaine, the nomination of an EPA administrator who does not accept basic climate science is deeply troubling.
[00:18:02.757 --> 00:18:07.659]  I think the bigger question from a policy point of view is who will drive economic policy in this administration?
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:21.286]  We still don't know who within the White House will be head of the National Economic Council, but these guys are not people with experience in government in a way that leads you, even with like a Bob Rubin, I don't really have a sense of what policies they're going to carry us out of.
[00:18:21.306 --> 00:18:26.168]  We are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country.
[00:18:27.729 --> 00:18:29.230]  The peaceful transition of power
[00:18:30.228 --> 00:18:32.930]  is one of the hallmarks of our democracy.
[00:18:33.671 --> 00:18:37.133]  And over the next few months, we are going to show that to the world.
[00:18:37.433 --> 00:18:39.895]  Some peaceful transition of power?
[00:18:40.175 --> 00:18:47.040]  We should have known by now that President Obama meant the polar opposite of what he told the American public.
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.302]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:16.387]  Three years ago, the Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act repealed the law that had been on the books for decades, barring the CIA and other agencies from engaging in domestic propaganda and disinformation.
[00:19:17.734 --> 00:19:36.358]  Over the weekend, they passed the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act that funds 160 plus million dollars to this new organization that will, quote, discover and counter with its own disinformation, alternative media that they dub fake news.
[00:19:37.659 --> 00:19:52.010]  At the very same time, we see mainstream media claiming that Trump, myself, Tucker Carlson, you name it, are Russian agents, and that the American people really wanted Hillary Clinton, but the Russians somehow hacked in, and that's why Trump won.
[00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:56.173]  Yes, we've gotten Trump elected, but they're openly trying to overthrow that.
[00:19:57.034 --> 00:20:00.379]  Now more than ever, InfoWars needs your prayers and your support.
[00:20:00.439 --> 00:20:06.106]  And I need you to take the articles and the videos that are on the site and realize you're the reason we're having such an effect.
[00:20:06.166 --> 00:20:07.948]  You're the power of InfoWars.
[00:20:08.329 --> 00:20:12.574]  Get those articles, get those videos, get those special reports out to everyone you know.
[00:20:13.869 --> 00:20:22.471]  As we approach Christmas, and I'm supposed to say that word now, our country's under such incredible thought police tyranny, it's important to be thankful.
[00:20:22.612 --> 00:20:34.215]  And I am extremely thankful to all of you that have prayed for us, that have spread the word about the broadcast, that have supported us, that have defended us, and that have financially supported us.

[00:20:59.002 --> 00:20:59.442]  I think so.
[00:21:20.994 --> 00:21:21.995]  1995 can't beat that deal.

[00:21:50.532 --> 00:21:59.003]  And finally, from myself, Alex Jones, and the rest of the InfoWars crew and my family, I want to wish all of you a blessed and merry Christmas.
[00:22:01.354 --> 00:22:03.054]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:22:03.654 --> 00:22:04.995]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[00:22:05.215 --> 00:22:08.755]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[00:22:09.115 --> 00:22:16.877]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[00:22:17.057 --> 00:22:21.858]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:22:22.018 --> 00:22:27.499]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[00:22:27.839 --> 00:22:35.380]  Secret 12 by InfoWarsLife is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:40.081]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:22:40.341 --> 00:22:49.163]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[00:22:49.363 --> 00:22:52.623]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[00:22:52.903 --> 00:22:56.484]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:56.804 --> 00:23:01.868]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:23:05.691 --> 00:23:08.913]  That's the headline on Thursday evening at DrugsReport.com.
[00:23:09.534 --> 00:23:11.495]  Fake book to label news.
[00:23:12.676 --> 00:23:15.018]  And of course, Hillary's labeled us the alt-right.
[00:23:15.358 --> 00:23:17.860]  And now she's calling for us to be shut down and censored.
[00:23:18.481 --> 00:23:21.963]  That's right out of Nazi Germany, where you label a group, then you outlaw a group.
[00:23:22.404 --> 00:23:23.845]  The classic tyranny is unfolding.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:31.709]  But when you actually read the Business Insider article, where they got the interview and the press release from the Facebook executives...
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:32.961]  They say it's worse than that.
[00:23:33.001 --> 00:23:47.209]  They use the words bury and ban news and they use Democratic Party and Soros funded groups like Snopes to decide what's going to be banned and they use algorithms to block you.
[00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:58.956]  They have a screenshot in here just like Google Chrome has been doing to InfoWars that says disputed by third parties so they're now inserting themselves and you're searching
[00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:04.952]  And saying, before you share the story, you might want to know that independent fact-checkers dispute this accuracy.
[00:24:05.253 --> 00:24:07.694]  Well, this is actually almost the red badge of courage now.
[00:24:07.954 --> 00:24:08.714]  You better share it.
[00:24:08.754 --> 00:24:14.557]  The problem is, there are real fake news sites, like the New York Times got caught running this week, that said Alec Baldwin was dead.
[00:24:15.697 --> 00:24:16.898]  That's the type of stuff they run.
[00:24:16.938 --> 00:24:18.039]  There's pure fake news.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.561]  But let them!
[00:24:19.981 --> 00:24:21.363]  Let people figure out it's fake.
[00:24:21.423 --> 00:24:24.385]  That site will be discredited as soon as you learn Alan Baldwin isn't dead.
[00:24:24.846 --> 00:24:30.992]  They then project that onto us to call for independent, true, hardcore journalists to be shut down.
[00:24:32.329 --> 00:24:38.212]  We told you it was coming last week when the EU came out and said, you have 24 hours, Facebook, Google, Twitter, to start censoring the alt-right.
[00:24:38.692 --> 00:24:39.713]  They even listed us.
[00:24:40.133 --> 00:24:48.217]  They said, use the Washington Post list that the Washington Post had to retract last week, saying that it was just made up.
[00:24:48.357 --> 00:24:51.398]  Remember they said, this list of hundreds of sites are Russian agents.
[00:24:51.838 --> 00:24:52.259]  Ban them.
[00:24:53.719 --> 00:24:55.020]  And then lawsuits started getting filed.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.041]  They said, OK, we don't know where we got the list.
[00:24:57.101 --> 00:24:57.621]  It's not real.
[00:24:57.681 --> 00:24:58.262]  We retract.
[00:24:58.662 --> 00:25:00.863]  So they're using retracted fake lists
[00:25:01.837 --> 00:25:03.858]  A few years ago, this would have been unthinkable.
[00:25:04.118 --> 00:25:07.359]  The head of the biggest website in the world, Zuckerberg,
[00:25:27.705 --> 00:25:43.691]  is meeting with the Communist Chinese to deploy their very fake news model that they started 20 years ago in 1996 and have arrested hundreds of thousands of people, executed tens of thousands including Buddhists who simply share Falun Gong material on the internet.
[00:25:44.171 --> 00:25:48.513]  That's who we're using as the model and as the advisors.
[00:25:49.557 --> 00:25:54.563]  To set this up in America and they're rolling it out that they're protecting the public.
[00:25:55.003 --> 00:25:56.765]  Just like the Communist Chinese do.
[00:25:57.286 --> 00:26:00.950]  Europe the last few years has been arresting people that mildly criticize Islam.
[00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:05.215]  They've been trying and convicting members of Parliament in Europe.
[00:26:05.555 --> 00:26:09.700]  They've been arresting people that say it's wrong when Muslims rape and kill women.
[00:26:11.448 --> 00:26:19.131]  This is the incredible destruction of free speech in the West and the First Amendment, and where is the left to speak out against it?
[00:26:19.711 --> 00:26:22.132]  Read the statements for yourself.
[00:26:22.952 --> 00:26:24.533]  This is how they label things.
[00:26:24.893 --> 00:26:32.756]  Real media is fake news, and then the dinosaur media labels their incredible censorship and their rollout of tyranny
[00:26:33.743 --> 00:26:35.164]  And while all of this is happening,
[00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:05.943]  Corporate media is out announcing no one's censoring Alex Jones.
[00:27:07.283 --> 00:27:08.344]  None of this is happening.
[00:27:08.964 --> 00:27:09.825]  It's made up.
[00:27:10.825 --> 00:27:12.046]  It's not going on.
[00:27:12.747 --> 00:27:16.649]  But then in the next segment, they say, we've got to shut Alex Jones down.
[00:27:16.969 --> 00:27:17.649]  So it's literal 1984.
[00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:19.410]  We don't censor.
[00:27:19.951 --> 00:27:23.713]  We don't shut people down as it's happening to Breitbart and others, not just us.
[00:27:24.393 --> 00:27:26.975]  And the next segment, we've got to shut Alex Jones down.
[00:27:28.629 --> 00:27:31.872]  This is the level of brainwashing that's going on.
[00:27:32.392 --> 00:27:34.114]  Now, the good news is, this failed.
[00:27:34.254 --> 00:27:38.577]  They tried to suppress the Trump Revolution, Brexit, and other movements for sovereignty.
[00:27:39.018 --> 00:27:43.401]  And now they're quadrupling down in an attempt, I guess, to beat us into submission.
[00:27:44.002 --> 00:27:47.485]  They're trying to openly overthrow Trump's election, so God knows what's going to happen.
[00:27:47.685 --> 00:27:49.967]  But I want to reach out to those of you on the fence about this.
[00:27:50.527 --> 00:27:51.528]  You shouldn't be on the fence.
[00:27:52.028 --> 00:27:57.513]  This is classical authoritarianism rearing its ugly, stinking head in front of the world.
[00:27:58.174 --> 00:28:05.157]  The clear champions of yellow journalism going back over a hundred plus years are mainstream newspapers and television and radio.
[00:28:05.717 --> 00:28:09.318]  Corporate media and state-run media are the all-time champions of fake news.
[00:28:09.818 --> 00:28:13.020]  The Communist Chinese government's the all-time champions of the champions.
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:14.720]  They're also the champions of mass murder.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:26.745]  So it's no mistake they're running this operation and we're in the Wall Street Journal just two weeks ago lecturing Americans and other papers as well that we'd better shut down the alt-right or they'd pull their money out of our treasury bonds.
[00:28:27.625 --> 00:28:28.966]  We're now going under globalism.
[00:28:28.987 --> 00:28:35.173]  We're now like a colonial country held by foreign nations being dictated what we should do.
[00:28:35.794 --> 00:28:42.861]  And in other developments, they've come out in a press briefing and said that Roger Stone is really like a Russian agent.
[00:28:43.542 --> 00:28:45.223]  And that he must have talked to Trump.
[00:28:45.383 --> 00:28:46.724]  They just say he must have.
[00:28:46.984 --> 00:28:47.744]  That's their new news.
[00:28:48.385 --> 00:28:57.129]  And that's why Trump at his last press conference in July said, I don't know anything about Russians or who did this hacking, but it ought to be who actually, you know, has the bad material.
[00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:00.851]  Stop changing the subject from who hacked it to what's in these WikiLeaks.
[00:29:01.172 --> 00:29:05.074]  But if Russia does have more emails, if they do have Hillary's missing emails, release them.
[00:29:05.774 --> 00:29:07.735]  Now, he's not saying he's a Russian agent there.
[00:29:08.376 --> 00:29:10.657]  He's saying, if you've got him, release him!
[00:29:11.198 --> 00:29:15.381]  He's throwing it back in their face because they were saying he was a Russian agent at that time.
[00:29:16.201 --> 00:29:19.303]  But the whole Russian narrative itself is a disinformation campaign.
[00:29:19.624 --> 00:29:24.247]  Clapper, the head of all intelligence, came out two days ago to Congress and said, no, there's no evidence the Russians act.
[00:29:24.807 --> 00:29:26.989]  They've had to have the Attorney General come out and cover her butt.
[00:29:28.072 --> 00:29:30.774]  CYA and say no there's no evidence because it's made up.
[00:29:31.295 --> 00:29:39.763]  My CIA contacts and other contacts I have told me last week and I said on air this is a splinter group of rogue leftists giving a fake report to Hillary and Obama.
[00:29:40.143 --> 00:29:40.964]  That now came out.
[00:29:41.544 --> 00:29:43.386]  We have real sources.
[00:29:44.066 --> 00:29:47.910]  I'm not going to brag about the sources but they're as high as they go.
[00:29:49.491 --> 00:29:51.313]  As high as they go.
[00:29:53.484 --> 00:30:00.087]  And what the globalists better understand is there are a lot of people worldwide that are aware that there's a takeover.
[00:30:00.127 --> 00:30:01.068]  Let me say this in closing.
[00:30:02.328 --> 00:30:11.273]  Glenn Beck was hired 11 years ago by a consortium to basically be the new Alex Jones.
[00:30:11.353 --> 00:30:15.335]  They knew that I was getting top ratings on small stations but I wasn't with the Clear Channel because I wouldn't be censored.
[00:30:16.455 --> 00:30:21.998]  I was told this about seven years ago when I first learned about it when I was at Fox News when he was still there by people very close to him.
[00:30:22.924 --> 00:30:26.265]  He was meant to take my show and like mix it with Oprah Winfrey was what he was directed to do.
[00:30:26.305 --> 00:30:26.785]  He's an actor.
[00:30:28.186 --> 00:30:29.086]  And this ties into all this.
[00:30:30.527 --> 00:30:32.187]  Now, he kind of rubbed them the wrong way.
[00:30:32.207 --> 00:30:33.227]  He thought he would do his own thing.
[00:30:33.288 --> 00:30:33.828]  He left.
[00:30:34.428 --> 00:30:36.529]  And now the last two years he wants to be the Judas Code.
[00:30:36.569 --> 00:30:37.309]  I said this before he did it.
[00:30:37.889 --> 00:30:46.712]  Who represents the conservatives but discredits us and is the apologist and comes out and basically explains how we're bad, how we're frauds, and how we should be censored.
[00:30:47.199 --> 00:30:53.082]  He met with Zuckerberg a few months ago and agrees that things need to be censored, so his material will be promoted.
[00:30:53.382 --> 00:31:01.125]  And he's put in these government graphics that have been put out, he's put in there as more trusted, obviously, than the rest of the quote, right wing.
[00:31:02.226 --> 00:31:04.987]  These labels mean nothing, but that's how they do it, in their false paradigm.
[00:31:05.988 --> 00:31:09.629]  So that's why he got so scared two years ago and cozied up to these people.
[00:31:10.029 --> 00:31:15.292]  When Matt Drudge got the threat, and then met with the Supreme Court Justice, he didn't back off, he intensified what he was doing.
[00:31:16.308 --> 00:31:25.571]  But you need to understand, people like News Corp and Rupert Murdoch is totally over the side against Trump because he was told you're going to be shut down if you don't basically join with us.
[00:31:26.152 --> 00:31:32.054]  If I seem a bit hysterical, it's because the foundation of our free society, the First Amendment, is being dissolved.
[00:31:33.494 --> 00:31:39.837]  They are setting up a secretary of speech, a thought police, a ministry of truth publicly in America.
[00:31:40.657 --> 00:31:42.318]  The left is calling for war with Russia.
[00:31:42.678 --> 00:31:45.519]  Obama just dispatched masses of troops to the border with Russia.
[00:31:46.892 --> 00:31:49.133]  He's got 33 days, 34 days left.
[00:31:49.193 --> 00:31:52.955]  I mean, they do not want to turn loose of power because the globalists thought they had this country.
[00:31:53.595 --> 00:31:55.496]  But I don't say people should be shut down.
[00:31:56.336 --> 00:32:00.838]  I don't say people should be shut down according to my little graph we made in an hour.
[00:32:02.239 --> 00:32:14.664]  I just say it's obviously historically more accurate that more liberty-based, more independent is genuinely more accurate versus state-run and corporate-run that normally pushes centralized control and authoritarianism and tyranny.
[00:32:15.224 --> 00:32:15.924]  Everybody knows that.
[00:32:16.224 --> 00:32:17.485]  Liberty versus tyranny.
[00:32:17.765 --> 00:32:20.126]  Independence brings choice, wide spectrum.
[00:32:20.686 --> 00:32:23.287]  Centralized brings stagnation, corruption, control.
[00:32:23.687 --> 00:32:25.028]  Think Soviet Union, things like that.
[00:32:25.808 --> 00:32:31.752]  But no, no, no, they just say state run is trusted and good and impartial and loving and never faking.
[00:32:32.012 --> 00:32:33.272]  Total garbage!
[00:32:36.554 --> 00:32:43.518]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:32:43.779 --> 00:32:45.860]  You better believe you got one!
[00:33:02.486 --> 00:33:07.267]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[00:33:07.407 --> 00:33:14.469]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down, I quit working out, I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[00:33:14.729 --> 00:33:23.212]  I started to exercise really hard again, and I started to try to eat healthy, started taking third-party supplements, started seeing some more gains.
[00:33:23.732 --> 00:33:27.553]  But when I started working with Dr. Group and some of the other top formulators in the country,
[00:33:27.913 --> 00:33:34.038]  They said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that the population is absolutely deficient in.
[00:33:34.278 --> 00:33:34.619]  Boom!
[00:33:34.959 --> 00:33:36.400]  Weight started pouring off.
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.402]  Toxins started coming out of my body.
[00:33:38.882 --> 00:33:45.307]  Then, by early 2016, I was in the best shape of my life since I'd been in really good shape in my 20s.
[00:33:45.448 --> 00:33:46.528]  But the election heated up.
[00:33:46.588 --> 00:33:48.950]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[00:33:49.071 --> 00:33:51.953]  But more importantly, I stopped taking supplements because we
[00:33:52.253 --> 00:33:52.513]  I think.
[00:34:12.415 --> 00:34:15.257]  If the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[00:34:15.457 --> 00:34:16.377]  It's December 5th, 2016.
[00:34:16.517 --> 00:34:20.339]  We're only like 25 days from 2017.
[00:34:20.559 --> 00:34:30.645]  And I want to invite all of the Info Warriors of every race, color, and creed that bleed red blood and love liberty, justice, and truth to make our bodies great again.
[00:34:33.564 --> 00:34:38.547]  One of the most common questions I get is, you've changed the whole radio TV model.
[00:34:39.347 --> 00:34:40.087]  How did you do it?
[00:34:40.127 --> 00:34:41.708]  Did an ad agency teach you that?
[00:34:41.728 --> 00:34:43.029]  Or what book did you read?
[00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:44.910]  And the answer is, it was trial and error.
[00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:50.472]  I promote products that I personally use, like the Nutraceuticals and Infowarslife.com.
[00:34:50.953 --> 00:34:52.774]  And it's the same thing for this promotion.
[00:34:53.254 --> 00:34:54.595]  I didn't get this from an ad agency.
[00:34:54.655 --> 00:34:55.855]  I didn't just think this up.
[00:34:56.335 --> 00:34:58.436]  I was sitting there, I'd gained probably 10-15 pounds.
[00:34:59.657 --> 00:35:03.199]  Because I've gotten out of the habit of taking the supplements in the last few months with the election.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:07.122]  And I was thinking, wow, I need to religiously take these.
[00:35:07.662 --> 00:35:08.903]  Because I'm promoting these things.
[00:35:08.963 --> 00:35:09.823]  It's making me healthier.
[00:35:10.083 --> 00:35:12.545]  And if I'm not taking them, you know, I'm fatter.
[00:35:12.785 --> 00:35:14.026]  Plus, people aren't going to buy the product.
[00:35:14.526 --> 00:35:15.967]  So that's where the promotion comes from.
[00:35:16.267 --> 00:35:17.628]  It's purely from reality.
[00:35:18.004 --> 00:35:19.845]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table.
[00:35:20.245 --> 00:35:24.827]  I'm religiously taking the products, and in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[00:35:25.167 --> 00:35:31.649]  I've lost five pounds, religiously taking just, what, four or five of the products.
[00:35:32.029 --> 00:35:32.569]  It's amazing.
[00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:35.230]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[00:35:35.511 --> 00:35:38.212]  Go read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:35:38.412 --> 00:35:40.993]  And to be clear, I'm exercising the same amount.
[00:35:41.673 --> 00:35:45.574]  It's the holidays, so I'm eating pumpkin pie, pecan pie.
[00:35:45.594 --> 00:35:46.995]  I ate a candy bar last night.
[00:35:48.439 --> 00:35:51.581]  I mean, quite frankly, I eat more junk during the holidays like everybody else.
[00:35:52.021 --> 00:35:53.282]  So I'm eating worse.
[00:35:53.902 --> 00:36:01.286]  But because I've got these trace elements, or whatever it's doing in DNA Force and X2 and Supermail, I have lost 5 pounds.
[00:36:01.426 --> 00:36:01.967]  It's incredible.
[00:36:02.967 --> 00:36:04.908]  I thought I might lose 10 to 15 in a month.
[00:36:05.129 --> 00:36:06.409]  If this continues, it'll be 20.
[00:36:06.509 --> 00:36:08.931]  But generally, it's more dramatic up front.
[00:36:09.531 --> 00:36:10.412]  This is an experiment.
[00:36:10.512 --> 00:36:11.272]  Everybody's watching.
[00:36:11.512 --> 00:36:12.353]  We'll see what happens.
[00:36:12.793 --> 00:36:13.633]  This is Part 2.
[00:36:14.744 --> 00:36:15.685]  Next week, part three.
[00:36:16.445 --> 00:36:17.065]  That's a good point.
[00:36:17.866 --> 00:36:26.990]  We just cut there and Rob Deuce said, hey Alex, I know you don't follow script, but you might want to add to people, we're running some of the biggest specials of the year until December 17th.
[00:36:27.271 --> 00:36:32.994]  That's the last day that you can get your order in and have guaranteed shipping anywhere in the United States.
[00:36:33.194 --> 00:36:34.935]  And we have some of the biggest specials of the year.
[00:36:35.795 --> 00:36:38.837]  50% off many of the nutraceuticals, the lowest discounts 25%, 30% off X2,
[00:36:41.898 --> 00:36:59.271]  Huge discounts and free shipping storewide on every product thousands of items and on top of that if you sign up for auto ship an additional 10% off and I'm gonna do one more bad thing because I'm politically correct I guess I'm politically incorrect and that's a Merry Christmas to everybody.
[00:36:59.591 --> 00:37:00.772]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:37:00.832 --> 00:37:01.413]  You're awesome
[00:37:04.289 --> 00:37:06.870]  And welcome to InfoWars.com.
[00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:08.751]  We are here with a live broadcast.
[00:37:08.811 --> 00:37:13.653]  We are awaiting the press conference that's going to be held by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
[00:37:14.153 --> 00:37:16.775]  He is ready to kind of close the book.
[00:37:17.015 --> 00:37:23.157]  He's going to be offering us all of the conclusive evidence, kind of the conclusion on the birth certificate controversy.
[00:37:23.938 --> 00:37:25.618]  Margaret, we've been waiting years for this.
[00:37:25.698 --> 00:37:27.599]  Oh, no kidding.
[00:37:27.979 --> 00:37:30.961]  The media is saying that it's debunked birtherism.
[00:37:31.021 --> 00:37:31.461]  That's what they're
[00:37:31.561 --> 00:37:42.528]  I'm calling it and we know that they're the real purveyors of fake news and we really can't believe anything they say and this sheriff has been covering this and investigating it for quite some time.
[00:37:42.988 --> 00:37:55.877]  This is breaking information and all of the newswire about this story is attacking him and not even focusing on the fact that we have a real issue where we potentially have a fake birth certificate with our president.
[00:37:57.018 --> 00:38:01.001]  Much like with the WikiLeaks, it's not about the anomalies that are there.
[00:38:01.041 --> 00:38:03.022]  It's not about the information that's contained within.
[00:38:03.062 --> 00:38:04.764]  Let's just worry about who hacked in.
[00:38:05.324 --> 00:38:14.751]  Or, like you said, let's just go ahead and attack this sheriff, who has been elected the sheriff for quite some time, but he's not a credible witness there.
[00:38:15.652 --> 00:38:20.836]  And like I said, there is a kind of an A to Z up on World Net Daily.
[00:38:21.016 --> 00:38:25.158]  And you know, there was a lot of things that people were talking about.
[00:38:25.198 --> 00:38:32.784]  For instance, the the the race of Barack Obama wasn't consistent with what it would have been in the 1960s.
[00:38:33.684 --> 00:38:37.427]  It looked as if there was some difference in the gradiation on the paper.
[00:38:37.507 --> 00:38:41.329]  Was it, you know, a forgery printed on a false document?
[00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:44.992]  You know, and this is the kind of stuff that happens a lot, of course.
[00:38:45.652 --> 00:38:57.281]  That was the issue when President George W. Bush was almost elected and they had that fake document and turns out the printer, the typewriter, gave it away because it wasn't the proper.
[00:38:57.401 --> 00:38:59.703]  So this is, you know, that was a long time ago.
[00:38:59.743 --> 00:39:01.164]  So this is definitely nothing new.
[00:39:01.405 --> 00:39:02.005]  Creating forgery.
[00:39:02.265 --> 00:39:22.299]  The Frank Marshall Davis aspect of this, so the facial recognition, you know, overlaying President Obama's face with Frank Martin, there are scientific measures, the points of the face and then laying it over whom he's claiming is his father, that there could be something going on with that and the break in this, you know, I'm, oh here we go.
[00:39:22.619 --> 00:39:26.642]  My name is Chris Hegstrom, I am the Director of Media Relations for the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office.
[00:39:26.662 --> 00:39:28.824]  I want to take a moment to welcome a couple people here.
[00:39:29.366 --> 00:39:35.311]  Now are we watching this on the, I believe you can watch this live stream on our PIOS Facebook page.
[00:39:35.371 --> 00:39:43.317]  Thank you guys so much for joining us here at InfoWars.com and watching this on the Alex Jones Facebook page.
[00:39:43.498 --> 00:39:44.819]  Thank you for being here, Bob.
[00:39:45.679 --> 00:39:46.400]  And helping Joe.
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:47.681]  And helping Joe, right?
[00:39:49.022 --> 00:39:55.067]  Today Sheriff Arpaio has information to you on a case that they've been working since August of 2011.
[00:39:57.603 --> 00:40:04.649]  Since the beginning of this investigation, you, the media, have continued to mischaracterize the nature of this investigation.
[00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:12.936]  So, you're going to hear this more than once today, but this investigation was never about where President Obama was born.
[00:40:12.956 --> 00:40:14.137]  Right, it was a distraction.
[00:40:14.157 --> 00:40:20.522]  It was about a document that was presented to the general public through the White House and purported to be a factual document.
[00:40:21.851 --> 00:40:27.454]  Today you're going to hear lots of information that some of you are going to understand and are going to be able to tell the true story.
[00:40:27.775 --> 00:40:33.198]  In fact, please know that this is a very technical, but the evidence is clear if you'll pay attention.
[00:40:33.678 --> 00:40:35.999]  Please note you're going to hear about two separate experts.
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:44.404]  These experts are two separate continents with no knowledge of each other and they draw similar conclusions.
[00:40:45.164 --> 00:40:46.085]  Again, that said,
[00:40:46.852 --> 00:40:50.133]  I know some of you are going to get this story and are going to tell the story the way it was.
[00:40:50.193 --> 00:41:00.198]  However, there's going to be others here today who will continue to malign this sheriff and Mike Zullo in order to show that you haven't been wrong for many years while covering this story.
[00:41:00.938 --> 00:41:04.679]  All I ask is that you are respectful during the presentation of the information.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.540]  Here's Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
[00:41:07.781 --> 00:41:08.761]  Thank you.
[00:41:08.941 --> 00:41:10.362]  I wonder if the President's watching this.
[00:41:13.463 --> 00:41:15.245]  Thank you for showing up.
[00:41:15.565 --> 00:41:37.841]  Back in 2011, about 250 members of the Surprise Tea Party came to me and asked me to investigate President Obama's birth certificate, since they believe evidence
[00:41:39.395 --> 00:41:43.098]  Showed that the certificate was a fraud.
[00:41:44.479 --> 00:41:46.121]  I agreed to look into the matter.
[00:41:48.523 --> 00:41:55.909]  And with Chief Investigator Mike Zullo, we initiated an investigation.
[00:41:59.031 --> 00:42:07.098]  At this time, and to this day, I stated that I did not care
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.441]  Where the president was born.
[00:42:11.082 --> 00:42:12.303]  Had nothing to do with that.
[00:42:12.323 --> 00:42:12.763]  Right.
[00:42:14.344 --> 00:42:16.206]  Was it a forged document?
[00:42:16.466 --> 00:42:22.370]  We were going to investigate a possible government forged document.
[00:42:22.751 --> 00:42:24.232]  I hope you get that straight.
[00:42:24.372 --> 00:42:27.474]  I've been saying that from day one since 2011.
[00:42:30.196 --> 00:42:37.622]  Today you will be presented with an in-depth executive summary of our investigation
[00:42:39.085 --> 00:43:00.017]  Into the matter which we now have concluded to be a fraudulently created document which has been represented as an official copy of the original birth certificate of President Obama.
[00:43:00.037 --> 00:43:00.157]  Right.
[00:43:02.478 --> 00:43:07.621]  We and anyone else who dared to question the document
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:26.167]  Have been maligned, falsely labeled, grossly criticized in the bulk of the media on certain internet sources for years.
[00:43:26.487 --> 00:43:27.247]  Fake news sources.
[00:43:27.287 --> 00:43:30.488]  Today, we're going to set the record straight.
[00:43:31.749 --> 00:43:37.991]  I believe you will be shocked by what you hear and see today.
[00:43:39.824 --> 00:43:43.406]  Also, the implications will be profound.
[00:43:46.187 --> 00:43:52.210]  All we have ever wanted, ever wanted, was the truth in this matter.
[00:43:52.451 --> 00:44:03.536]  With the great hope that the document was indeed a valid representation of the original document.
[00:44:04.557 --> 00:44:05.077]  Think of that.
[00:44:06.098 --> 00:44:08.919]  We were trying to clear the President.
[00:44:10.188 --> 00:44:11.469]  It didn't work out that way.
[00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:14.931]  We had to follow the evidence.
[00:44:18.553 --> 00:44:25.937]  We let the evidence determine, the evidence determine the direction of the investigation.
[00:44:28.958 --> 00:44:32.040]  That's what we always do on any investigation.
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:33.361]  You get the evidence.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.460]  You're not supposed to just believe what the government tells you?
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.781]  It's an official doc- Conspiracy theorist.
[00:44:39.821 --> 00:44:42.841]  No matter what the investigation is about.
[00:44:44.802 --> 00:44:47.962]  You know, Leon, he's really sticking his neck out on the line for the American people here.
[00:44:48.002 --> 00:44:51.723]  So now, the important part is- And for the truth.
[00:44:52.503 --> 00:45:02.585]  To present the pertinent details and the executive summary of our analysis.
[00:45:03.697 --> 00:45:21.073]  I'm going to turn this over to Mike Zullo, who dedicated five years of his life, five years of his life, taking this mission on which I asked him to do five years ago.
[00:45:23.436 --> 00:45:25.698]  Mike, come on up.
[00:45:34.329 --> 00:45:34.969]  Thank you, Sheriff.
[00:45:37.671 --> 00:45:52.182]  I want to start by trying to give everyone here, including the media that's been viciously against us from the beginning, an understanding of how I tried to conduct this investigation.
[00:45:53.082 --> 00:45:55.964]  I believe in 2012, we did two press conferences.
[00:45:56.024 --> 00:46:02.189]  In those press conferences, I had made it clear that Sheriff Arpaio's original mandate to me
[00:46:03.015 --> 00:46:09.717]  Was Mike, take a look at this, clear this document, because I want to be the guy that clears this document and moves this country forward.
[00:46:10.038 --> 00:46:10.758]  This is no good.
[00:46:11.638 --> 00:46:12.518]  That was the mandate.
[00:46:14.419 --> 00:46:16.920]  Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way.
[00:46:18.621 --> 00:46:24.323]  Like the sheriff just told you, when you conduct criminal investigations, you have to let the evidence lead you.
[00:46:24.823 --> 00:46:26.123]  You never lead the evidence.
[00:46:27.424 --> 00:46:30.585]  And in doing this, my motive
[00:46:31.243 --> 00:46:31.703]  We're good to go.
[00:47:03.024 --> 00:47:11.171]  Our fellow info warriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:20.958]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.379 --> 00:47:25.222]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.302 --> 00:47:28.304]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.324 --> 00:47:29.825]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.

[00:48:59.626 --> 00:49:02.287]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:04.957 --> 00:49:09.438]  Well we have another update in the conspiracy theories that continue to flow out of the White House.
[00:49:09.518 --> 00:49:20.861]  This is very troubling considering the fact they just voted themselves 160 million dollars to authenticate news and to put out real news in its place of doing that through the State Department, the new Ministry of Truth.
[00:49:21.101 --> 00:49:25.363]  Now yesterday we were told, this is escalated, NBC reported that U.S.
[00:49:25.403 --> 00:49:30.284]  officials have now said they know that Putin personally was involved in the election hack.
[00:49:30.424 --> 00:49:31.104]  They say U.S.
[00:49:31.124 --> 00:49:42.326]  intelligence officials now believe with a high level of confidence, quote-unquote, that means that they don't have any physical evidence, that Russian President Putin became personally involved in the covert Russian campaign to interfere in the U.S.
[00:49:42.346 --> 00:49:43.327]  presidential elections.
[00:49:43.867 --> 00:49:51.688]  Two senior officials say new intelligence shows that Putin personally directed how hacked material from the Democrats is leaked and otherwise used.
[00:49:51.708 --> 00:49:53.169]  So what would that new intelligence be?
[00:49:53.229 --> 00:49:58.870]  Well, they say they believe that, quote, only Russia's senior most officials could have authorized these activities.
[00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:00.050]  That's their new intel.
[00:50:00.951 --> 00:50:05.776]  See, it's just an assumption that they base, they say this is an intelligence judgment.
[00:50:06.197 --> 00:50:08.759]  They say it's consistent with the Putin that I've watched.
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.142]  I worked with him as ambassador in the government.
[00:50:11.382 --> 00:50:12.764]  He had a vendetta against Hillary Clinton.
[00:50:12.784 --> 00:50:18.711]  Now we're going to talk about what I think is a real source of this leak and of course we had another illusion.
[00:50:19.131 --> 00:50:19.331]  I think?
[00:50:47.549 --> 00:50:49.270]  Would be a conspiracy theory.
[00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:52.571]  I don't know who killed Seth Rich.
[00:50:52.631 --> 00:50:53.612]  Nobody knows at this point.
[00:50:53.872 --> 00:50:58.614]  There's a lot of circumstantial evidence that points to Hillary Clinton, but we're not allowed to make that conclusion.
[00:50:58.634 --> 00:51:01.235]  Meanwhile, without any evidence, the U.S.
[00:51:01.275 --> 00:51:03.796]  officials put this with Putin, and I want to clarify this too.
[00:51:04.736 --> 00:51:14.804]  When they talk about hacking the election and doing something, they're not saying that he sent in Russian agents to vote even across the border, even though they weren't authorized to vote.
[00:51:14.944 --> 00:51:17.005]  They're not saying that they fiddled with the machines.
[00:51:17.025 --> 00:51:19.027]  They're not saying that they fiddled with the counts.
[00:51:19.087 --> 00:51:24.211]  No, what they're saying is that they hacked the election by telling you the truth about Hillary Clinton.
[00:51:24.271 --> 00:51:24.911]  Think about that.
[00:51:25.672 --> 00:51:26.213]  Think about that.
[00:51:26.613 --> 00:51:30.578]  Should we offer them a debt of gratitude for telling us the truth about her character?
[00:51:30.858 --> 00:51:32.460]  For telling us the truth about the DNC?
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:38.387]  For telling us the truth about the media that was conspiring with the DNC and with Hillary Clinton to deceive the public?
[00:51:38.427 --> 00:51:42.251]  And yet it's that same media now who is saying that it's a Russian hack.
[00:51:42.312 --> 00:51:44.174]  Today they took it to the next level.
[00:51:44.814 --> 00:51:46.556]  And this reminds me of what Mark Twain said.
[00:51:46.596 --> 00:51:51.380]  A lie, he said, can travel halfway around the world before the truth can even put its shoes on.
[00:51:52.201 --> 00:51:54.623]  Well, that was before the internet.
[00:51:54.984 --> 00:51:57.966]  Now it can go much quicker, and it comes from much higher levels.
[00:51:58.267 --> 00:52:03.952]  We now have, according to the Daily Mail, a White House launching its own conspiracy theory on the Russian hacking.
[00:52:04.412 --> 00:52:10.315]  Okay, Russian hacking was established, but now they're pulling conspiracy theory on top of conspiracy theory.
[00:52:10.595 --> 00:52:16.998]  This is Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, thinks that Roger Stone had something to do with it now.
[00:52:17.558 --> 00:52:23.981]  He suggested today that Roger Stone knew that the Kremlin ordered a hack on Democrat officials.
[00:52:25.222 --> 00:52:33.492]  The White House spokesman said it's possible that Stone delivered that information to Trump before he encouraged the Russians to release Hillary Clinton's emails in July.
[00:52:33.512 --> 00:52:37.197]  You see how they're piling assumption upon assumption and saying, well, it's possible, it's possible.
[00:52:37.477 --> 00:52:38.438]  A lot of things are possible.
[00:52:38.458 --> 00:52:41.822]  We're going to tell you some of the things that are possible on the other side.
[00:52:42.463 --> 00:52:50.391]  Now today we had an exclusive report from the Daily Mail saying that they talked to an ex-British ambassador who is now a WikiLeaks operative.
[00:52:50.731 --> 00:52:53.614]  He claims that Russia did not provide the Clinton emails.
[00:52:53.654 --> 00:52:58.039]  He said they were handed to him, handed to him at a DC park
[00:52:58.519 --> 00:53:02.102]  By an intermediary for disgusted Democrat whistleblowers.
[00:53:02.162 --> 00:53:03.142]  His name is Craig Murray.
[00:53:03.422 --> 00:53:05.664]  He's a former British ambassador to Uzbekistan.
[00:53:06.004 --> 00:53:09.887]  He's an associate of Julian Assange and he gave this information to Daily Mail.
[00:53:10.487 --> 00:53:13.249]  They say he flew to Washington DC to get these emails.
[00:53:13.529 --> 00:53:16.051]  He claims he had a clandestine handoff in a wooded area.
[00:53:16.371 --> 00:53:25.217]  He said the leaker's motivation was disgust at the corruption in the Clinton Foundation and the tilting of the primary election playing field against Bernie Sanders.
[00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:32.239]  Let's go to Seth Rich, because of this new information that just came out yesterday.
[00:53:36.005 --> 00:53:38.229]  Well, well, well, they said...
[00:53:39.301 --> 00:53:47.548]  That it would have been fake news that Barack Obama's birth certificate was forged, but it comes out that maybe that was real news.
[00:53:48.049 --> 00:53:51.812]  They said that Russia was responsible for the WikiLeaks hack.
[00:53:52.373 --> 00:53:56.076]  Well, it turns out that that might be the real fake news.
[00:53:56.456 --> 00:53:57.897]  This is a story out of Daily Mail.
[00:53:58.358 --> 00:54:04.343]  Exclusive ex-British ambassador who is now a WikiLeaks operative claims Russia did not provide Clinton even
[00:54:04.403 --> 00:54:05.164]  We're good to go.
[00:54:21.616 --> 00:54:27.564]  He claims he had a clandestine handoff in a wooded area near American University with one of the email sources.
[00:54:27.644 --> 00:54:31.128]  Man, this is starting to sound like some deep throat activity at Watergate.
[00:54:31.509 --> 00:54:36.395]  The leaker's motivation was discussed at the corruption of the Clinton Foundation and the
[00:54:37.455 --> 00:54:41.178]  Tilting of the primary election playing field against Bernie Sanders.
[00:54:41.258 --> 00:54:50.965]  Murray says the source had legal access to the information and the leaks came from inside which would mean that they were not hacks.
[00:54:51.685 --> 00:54:55.989]  Now obviously we're getting information from both sides.
[00:54:56.029 --> 00:54:57.189]  People saying it's Russia.
[00:54:57.229 --> 00:54:58.570]  People saying it's insiders.
[00:54:59.011 --> 00:55:04.054]  But I think most of the proof to the neutral observer with an open mind
[00:55:04.895 --> 00:55:07.217]  I would say that this came from an inside source.
[00:55:07.937 --> 00:55:09.898]  Now, we're gonna find out.
[00:55:10.018 --> 00:55:14.361]  Obviously, a lot of people think that Seth Rich may have been the source.
[00:55:14.481 --> 00:55:31.393]  Now, who knows if they'll ever tell us who the source was, but it is nice to at least have WikiLeaks coming out against the fake news that this was a Russian hack or this was some sort of a Russian plot to overthrow the election from Hillary Clinton.
[00:55:31.473 --> 00:55:32.634]  And even if it was, you know,
[00:55:33.294 --> 00:55:35.336]  I mean they couldn't even get the popular vote done.
[00:55:35.356 --> 00:55:43.363]  Of course it comes out in Detroit and in Wayne County in Michigan that those polls were actually rigged for Hillary.
[00:55:43.463 --> 00:55:58.196]  So again, all the proof is against the Russians meddling in this election and it would actually be people within the DNC who wanted to make sure Hillary Clinton would not get in or maybe just people within the DNC who didn't like seeing corruption period.
[00:55:58.736 --> 00:56:06.281]  It's amazing though how they want you to focus on who's responsible for getting this information out instead of the actual corruption within.
[00:56:06.681 --> 00:56:08.202]  But of course this goes on.
[00:56:08.222 --> 00:56:12.884]  They're going to do whatever they can to try to undermine Donald Trump and the movement that got him elected.
[00:56:13.645 --> 00:56:17.227]  Now electors are being harassed and threatened in a bid to stop Trump.
[00:56:17.267 --> 00:56:18.347]  This is ongoing.
[00:56:18.668 --> 00:56:24.071]  Electors around the country are being harassed with a barrage of emails, phone calls, letters, even death threats.
[00:56:24.591 --> 00:56:28.853]  Because remember, when they go low, well actually it turns out that they go lower.
[00:56:29.133 --> 00:56:34.716]  In an effort to block Donald Trump from being voted in as president by the Electoral College on Monday.
[00:56:34.756 --> 00:56:38.917]  Now Sharon Geis is a grandmother from Mesa, Arizona.
[00:56:38.978 --> 00:56:46.061]  Woke up on Wednesday morning with more than 1,500 emails demanding she not carry out her legal duty to vote for the president-elect.
[00:56:46.381 --> 00:56:48.382]  She said they just keep coming and coming.
[00:56:49.042 --> 00:56:53.404]  Estimating she's received more than 50,000 emails since the election.
[00:56:53.664 --> 00:57:00.106]  Despite the avalanche, however, she says her decision to back Donald Trump is stronger than ever!
[00:57:00.587 --> 00:57:01.547]  How do you like that?
[00:57:01.627 --> 00:57:03.188]  Now, you know what?
[00:57:03.248 --> 00:57:04.588]  I was going to play this video.
[00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:08.110]  If you just want to go ahead and roll this video real quick, we'll cut out early.
[00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:12.911]  But basically, these celebrities now are coming out saying that the electors shouldn't vote for Trump.
[00:57:12.931 --> 00:57:14.052]  You can go ahead and go to that clip right now.
[00:57:15.708 --> 00:57:18.710]  Members of the Electoral College, this message is for you.
[00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:27.895]  As you know, our founding fathers built the Electoral College to safeguard the American people from the dangers... From people like Hillary Clinton winning states like California.
[00:57:27.915 --> 00:57:28.575]  Yeah, we know.
[00:57:29.036 --> 00:57:29.476]  You don't.
[00:57:30.176 --> 00:57:35.399]  Okay, so these, you know, these little celebrity nitwits, you know what, just go ahead and cut them off.
[00:57:35.439 --> 00:57:36.020]  Just cut them out.
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:36.520]  I don't care.
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.100]  We're done with them.
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:37.821]  We're done with them.
[00:57:38.321 --> 00:57:39.342]  Here's headline.
[00:57:39.762 --> 00:57:41.243]  Celebrity nitwits
[00:57:42.063 --> 00:57:44.727]  Begging electors to break the law.
[00:57:45.227 --> 00:57:46.429]  Now here's the other thing about this.
[00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:50.133]  Donald Trump has been one step ahead of these people every time.
[00:57:50.173 --> 00:57:53.037]  So I would imagine he assumed something like this was coming.
[00:57:53.077 --> 00:57:55.140]  So I imagine he's one step ahead of these people.
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:56.341]  But don't they get it?
[00:57:56.722 --> 00:58:00.486]  Just like the elector just said, the more you push back,
[00:58:01.579 --> 00:58:02.820]  Against our support for Trump?
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:04.641]  The more we like Trump!
[00:58:04.901 --> 00:58:07.222]  That's how sick of you we are!
[00:58:07.482 --> 00:58:08.303]  But they don't get it!
[00:58:08.903 --> 00:58:10.464]  They really don't get it.
[00:58:10.564 --> 00:58:13.966]  Now, here is the latest push coming from the mainstream media.
[00:58:14.666 --> 00:58:15.667]  This is from CNN.
[00:58:16.187 --> 00:58:18.808]  White males dominate Trump's cabinet posts.
[00:58:19.188 --> 00:58:20.349]  And they sent out a tweet.
[00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:23.631]  Whitest White House ever.
[00:58:24.031 --> 00:58:25.152]  Now this is CNN, right?
[00:58:25.653 --> 00:58:27.135]  What did Martin Luther King say?
[00:58:27.195 --> 00:58:31.039]  We won't judge a man by the color of his skin, but by the content of his character.
[00:58:31.079 --> 00:58:32.040]  Well, where are you CNN?
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:33.862]  You're just judging the White House by the skin color.
[00:58:33.882 --> 00:58:34.643]  Same with Yahoo.
[00:58:34.903 --> 00:58:38.307]  Trump's cabinet is shaping up to be one of the whitest in history.
[00:58:38.968 --> 00:58:41.169]  I went ahead and I looked at Barack Obama's cabinet.
[00:58:41.449 --> 00:58:42.409]  Joe Biden, white.
[00:58:42.509 --> 00:58:43.429]  John Kerry, white.
[00:58:43.489 --> 00:58:44.370]  Jack Lew, white.
[00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:45.790]  Ashton Carter, white.
[00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:47.531]  Loretta Lynch, black.
[00:58:47.891 --> 00:58:49.091]  Sally Jewell, white.
[00:58:49.511 --> 00:58:50.852]  Thomas Vilsack, white.
[00:58:50.952 --> 00:58:52.152]  Penny Plitzer, white.
[00:58:52.372 --> 00:58:53.472]  White, white, white.
[00:58:53.512 --> 00:58:58.474]  You'd think that they would put out propaganda that actually made sense, but that's how real fake news works, folks.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.934]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.395 --> 00:59:20.087]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.427 --> 00:59:24.170]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.731 --> 00:59:29.395]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.795 --> 00:59:36.020]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:38.602]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
