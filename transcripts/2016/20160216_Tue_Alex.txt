[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.654]  To the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:14.741 --> 00:00:18.922]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:19.582 --> 00:00:20.363]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.163 --> 00:00:22.043]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.703 --> 00:00:26.344]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.884 --> 00:00:30.945]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:54.867]  Well, it is another information overload transmission for you today.
[00:00:56.172 --> 00:00:57.792]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:57.932 --> 00:00:58.932]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:58.952 --> 00:01:00.933]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:01:01.513 --> 00:01:15.155]  And we've got our reporters, David Knight, Joe Biggs, and a camera crew as well, now down at the scene of where Scalia reportedly died of natural causes, an anonymous phone call said.
[00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:19.916]  And there'll be no investigation by any of the media or the government, and there'll be no autopsy.
[00:01:19.936 --> 00:01:23.117]  They made sure to announce the next day, because there's nothing to see here.
[00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:24.877]  Just go to sleep, go away.
[00:01:26.177 --> 00:01:43.342]  But since then, we have leftist journalists and social media users spewing a torrent of hate after the death of Scalia, and calling and praying for and hoping for the death of, of course, Clarence Thomas.
[00:01:43.422 --> 00:01:52.484]  And Paul Watson and Steve Watson have both written articles on this, chronicling and just linking through all these different examples of the vitriol.
[00:01:52.524 --> 00:01:54.245]  So they hope everyone dies.
[00:01:55.285 --> 00:02:15.115]  If you go to World Net Daily, they have a really, really important story that photos of Poindexter that owned the ranch and ate dinner right next to Scalia that night and saw him go to bed and then came and found his body with a pillow over the face, this black ops commander from Vietnam, buddies with
[00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:24.355]  Obama and giving him so many contributions that Obama made up an award just basically for him and then presented it to him.
[00:02:25.155 --> 00:02:28.757]  So those articles are up on Infowars.com and WorldNetDaily.
[00:02:29.037 --> 00:02:36.802]  Will Texas governor call for investigation into Scalia's death?
[00:02:38.423 --> 00:02:41.485]  That's another report from Infowars.com and Don Salazar.
[00:02:41.865 --> 00:02:43.486]  It's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:02:48.322 --> 00:02:51.024]  Now continuing, we're going to be going over all of this today.
[00:02:51.444 --> 00:02:55.106]  Here's the particular article so I can show it to viewers and mention it to radio listeners.
[00:02:55.146 --> 00:02:56.027]  You can find it for yourself.
[00:02:56.387 --> 00:03:00.630]  Obama Poindexter Picks Fuel Scalia Suspicions.
[00:03:01.591 --> 00:03:03.132]  And then you can go through and see the two...
[00:03:05.453 --> 00:03:10.679]  Embracing and Poindexter getting his loving award with his good little buddy that he's given so much money to Obama.
[00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:17.346]  And then Scalia doesn't bring a security detail and goes to the ranch and, well, now sleeps with a pillow over his face.
[00:03:23.055 --> 00:03:33.138]  Now, continuing here, we're also going to be getting into the situation with First Amendment critic, the Attorney General, that says you can ban free speech.
[00:03:33.178 --> 00:03:38.160]  We've played that clip, and that there's no protection on offensive speech that hurts people's feelings.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.542]  They started talking about removing her, impeaching her a few months ago in Congress when she said that, and then she reversed herself.
[00:03:46.302 --> 00:03:48.103]  A First Amendment critic may get
[00:03:48.763 --> 00:03:59.326]  The nomination for the Supreme Court Justice, that's a Curt Nemo article, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, of course they're banning buildings named Lynch because it hurts people's feelings.
[00:03:59.346 --> 00:04:02.306]  Will she change her name because it's associated with lynching?
[00:04:02.326 --> 00:04:05.947]  Of course it's not associated with lynching, it's an Irish name, but who cares?
[00:04:06.447 --> 00:04:08.368]  Attorney General Loretta Lynch
[00:04:09.428 --> 00:04:14.551]  Or Attorney General Loretta, racist name, hang black people, hurt my feelings Lynch.
[00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:17.452]  That's what they say this name means.
[00:04:17.792 --> 00:04:22.914]  Attorney General Loretta Lynch has publicly expressed enmity towards First Amendment.
[00:04:22.934 --> 00:04:27.136]  So another very important story that we're going to be going over today.
[00:04:27.176 --> 00:04:28.957]  And then another flashback of another tyrant.
[00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:35.220]  Justice Kennedy said Constitution is a flawed document and needs to be rewritten.
[00:04:36.291 --> 00:04:38.312]  We have another article up on Infowars.com.
[00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:43.193]  Former intel officer suspects foul play in death of Anthony Scalia.
[00:04:43.913 --> 00:04:44.733]  And then the big news.
[00:04:45.153 --> 00:04:46.354]  Russia bans all U.S.
[00:04:46.374 --> 00:04:49.074]  corn and soy imports due to GMO contamination.
[00:04:49.735 --> 00:04:52.315]  Pope Francis calls migration the challenge of our age.
[00:04:52.355 --> 00:04:54.336]  Of course, met for the first time in their history.
[00:04:54.756 --> 00:05:00.882]  With the Orthodox Church, you can argue which one's older, but the two have been at loggerheads for over a thousand years.
[00:05:01.242 --> 00:05:02.243]  Big things are happening.
[00:05:02.303 --> 00:05:04.245]  Planets are politically aligning.
[00:05:04.885 --> 00:05:07.348]  We've got huge news on China's economy and more.
[00:05:09.673 --> 00:05:20.945]  We have previously seen 3D printing technology bring us things like simple household items, more advanced components of firearms, and now it's being reported that they can even produce body parts.
[00:05:21.465 --> 00:05:32.457]  A team at Wake Forest University has used a combination of living cells and a special gel to print out human body parts, including ears, muscles, and jaw bones, reports
[00:05:32.657 --> 00:05:33.557]  It's NBC News.
[00:05:33.897 --> 00:05:45.081]  It's an advance on previous attempts, which either involved making a plastic scaffold and then trying to get cells to grow in and on it, or that printed out organ shapes that ended up being too floppy and dying.
[00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:52.604]  The new approach mixes live cells with a gel that starts out as liquid but quickly hardens to the consistency of living tissue.
[00:05:52.884 --> 00:05:55.605]  The challenge of making living tissue is complicated.
[00:05:55.985 --> 00:06:02.050]  Even a simple structure like an ear has several types of cells and they must all be fed by tiny capillaries.
[00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.552]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com
[00:06:08.516 --> 00:06:08.956]  Hey, everyone!
[00:06:09.317 --> 00:06:11.579]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:15.182]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:06:15.462 --> 00:06:17.063]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:27.452]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:06:27.833 --> 00:06:33.798]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:06:34.138 --> 00:06:34.398]  I think so.
[00:06:49.235 --> 00:06:49.796]  I think so.
[00:07:09.754 --> 00:07:13.156]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:07:13.517 --> 00:07:20.641]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:07:21.262 --> 00:07:29.627]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:07:29.888 --> 00:07:34.030]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:07:34.271 --> 00:07:39.454]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:07:39.874 --> 00:07:43.797]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:07:44.117 --> 00:07:47.279]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[00:07:47.539 --> 00:07:58.626]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[00:07:58.666 --> 00:08:01.348]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[00:08:01.588 --> 00:08:07.532]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[00:08:19.136 --> 00:08:24.261]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:08:24.801 --> 00:08:27.183]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:08:30.707 --> 00:08:34.350]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is already Tuesday, the 16th day of February, 2016.
[00:08:35.151 --> 00:08:37.833]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:37.913 --> 00:08:40.035]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:08:40.776 --> 00:08:45.160]  Our reporters have already interviewed
[00:08:47.552 --> 00:08:55.634]  Multiple public officials down in Southwest Texas, they are traveling.
[00:08:57.065 --> 00:09:06.987]  To Marfa to talk to Judge Cinderella Guevara right now, who did everything by phone and said that she decided he died from natural causes, though she never saw the body.
[00:09:07.887 --> 00:09:14.549]  She's not a doctor, but hey, who needs to, you know, actually do that when you're dying of natural causes?
[00:09:14.629 --> 00:09:17.469]  I mean, Kennedy did as well in 63 in Dallas.
[00:09:18.129 --> 00:09:20.890]  Also, they've already talked to Judge Juanita Bishop.
[00:09:21.803 --> 00:09:26.945]  Who was the first one who made the phone call, reportedly, announcing it was natural causes.
[00:09:28.046 --> 00:09:30.026]  So, just, who needs an autopsy?
[00:09:30.066 --> 00:09:32.127]  Who needs any public investigation?
[00:09:32.167 --> 00:09:35.429]  Just wave your hand and say that, you know, everything's completely normal here.
[00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:38.910]  He died of a heart attack, and then later say he did not die of a heart attack.
[00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:43.012]  Even though you don't know why he died, but he had a pillow over his face.
[00:09:44.332 --> 00:09:47.133]  And then, of course, they're going to be headed out to the ranch itself.
[00:09:47.674 --> 00:09:50.695]  We'll have that intel by InfoWars Nightly News tonight.
[00:09:53.063 --> 00:09:55.026]  At seven o'clock central time.
[00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:56.528]  So that is coming up.
[00:09:57.109 --> 00:09:59.653]  They will be joining us in the third hour.
[00:10:01.454 --> 00:10:14.526]  Larry Nichols, who's fighting for his life via cancer, and of course the big Clinton insider, will be joining us to give us his intel on Scalia's death and what's happening in the world at the start of the next hour.
[00:10:14.626 --> 00:10:26.417]  And then InfoWars Nightly News political correspondent Richard Reeves will be joining us from South Carolina, as he's been doing from the other key battleground primary states like Iowa,
[00:10:26.937 --> 00:10:27.097]  And of
[00:10:47.092 --> 00:10:58.605]  I mean, the fourth hour a lot of days is even better than some of the other hours of the transmission hosted by our great crew like LeeAnn McAdoo, Jakari Jackson, Rob Dew, and so many others, like Paul Watson, Anthony Gucciardi.
[00:11:01.889 --> 00:11:06.534]  As we continue to build and expand a truly independent, liberty-based, libertarian-based
[00:11:08.171 --> 00:11:14.777]  Pro-human, pro-life based operation to take on the dying establishment, globalist media.
[00:11:14.998 --> 00:11:17.620]  We are taking it on very, very effectively.
[00:11:18.461 --> 00:11:22.885]  It's my job to take the heat and just to tell you what my gut and what the evidence shows.
[00:11:23.985 --> 00:11:27.186]  And to not play games and not be a coward.
[00:11:27.566 --> 00:11:37.329]  That's why I came out Saturday, hours after it was announced he was dead, did my research and said the fact that they instantly announced that he died of natural causes with a quote anonymous phone call.
[00:11:38.209 --> 00:11:42.850]  The fact that it's in the middle of nowhere and this this owner of the ranch is a high-level Democratic donor.
[00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:49.672]  The fact that they are instantly saying no foul play, there'll be no investigation.
[00:11:49.952 --> 00:11:53.033]  I said watch if there's no autopsy and we hear that quickly
[00:11:53.453 --> 00:12:00.538]  We know there's major alarms going off and of course the next morning the judge came in on a Sunday and said there will be no autopsy.
[00:12:02.879 --> 00:12:08.183]  But don't worry, he died of a heart attack because I talked to people on the phone who weren't doctors either.
[00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:10.725]  And a doctor wouldn't say looking at somebody what it was.
[00:12:12.005 --> 00:12:14.527]  Again, it's the jumping the gun that lets you know.
[00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:15.728]  It's like Building 7.
[00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.312]  I questioned Building 7 because I heard it on
[00:12:22.529 --> 00:12:25.291]  CBS News Radio, that was still around.
[00:12:26.611 --> 00:12:28.713]  I've been on air all day since that had happened that day.
[00:12:28.793 --> 00:12:31.114]  I'd driven from the studio to get a pizza.
[00:12:32.795 --> 00:12:35.696]  And to bring pizza back to the crew I had of two people at that time.
[00:12:37.537 --> 00:12:44.101]  And at 420-something, they said they're going to blow up the Solomon Brothers building, Building 7, to protect the other buildings.
[00:12:46.322 --> 00:12:47.183]  And then they blew it up.
[00:12:48.322 --> 00:12:50.103]  And I went on air and said they said they blew it up.
[00:12:50.163 --> 00:12:51.945]  People called in and said, yeah, I heard that too.
[00:12:52.525 --> 00:12:58.689]  And then we found the tapes of NPR and Fox and CNN and BBC, two different channels.
[00:13:00.691 --> 00:13:01.792]  And they said, how dare you?
[00:13:01.832 --> 00:13:02.432]  You liar.
[00:13:02.452 --> 00:13:04.113]  There's no tapes of anyone saying that.
[00:13:04.354 --> 00:13:08.517]  And we had all the anchors on TV, like seven or eight videos.
[00:13:08.537 --> 00:13:11.479]  They would have national stories saying Jones is lying.
[00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:14.401]  And the BBC actually came out and said it's a fake video.
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:23.501]  Then they came out of here later and said, no, it was actually us, and it was a Reuters feed, said the building had fallen pancake-style completely.
[00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:29.162]  I don't know what happened on 9-11.
[00:13:29.242 --> 00:13:30.683]  I'm not saying our military did it.
[00:13:30.963 --> 00:13:35.944]  I'm not saying... They always phrase it like, you say the firefighters blew it up, or you say the police did it.
[00:13:36.664 --> 00:13:41.845]  No, I'm saying they said they blew up the building before it even fell, and then it blew up and fell.
[00:13:42.225 --> 00:13:43.645]  There should be an investigation.
[00:13:48.803 --> 00:13:49.964]  And it's the same thing here.
[00:13:50.724 --> 00:13:53.685]  When this evidence mounts, you've got to have an investigation.
[00:13:53.905 --> 00:14:00.128]  And when they say, how dare you conspiracy theorists even question us when we have known liars running this whole system.
[00:14:00.328 --> 00:14:01.849]  They have put it in federal law.
[00:14:02.109 --> 00:14:03.370]  They can kill any U.S.
[00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:09.373]  citizen anywhere in the world, anytime they want, secretly, and never tell you, including Supreme Court justices.
[00:14:11.334 --> 00:14:13.715]  And now they're trying to pass the Defense Authorization Act.
[00:14:15.896 --> 00:14:24.344]  The War Authorization Act that will rewrite the war powers and give the President quote, worldwide global martial law power.
[00:14:25.125 --> 00:14:26.226]  That's not Alex Jones.
[00:14:26.546 --> 00:14:29.449]  That's the Senator from Connecticut, the Democrat.
[00:14:29.669 --> 00:14:30.049]  Pull it up.
[00:14:32.432 --> 00:14:33.453]  You can play the clip right now.
[00:14:33.733 --> 00:14:34.934]  I played it like 10 times.
[00:14:35.314 --> 00:14:38.297]  Want me to play it again?
[00:14:38.477 --> 00:14:39.899]  Let's cue up the Senator and
[00:14:41.986 --> 00:14:47.148]  I'm gonna play that just because we have new listeners all the time and they'll write a news article saying I'm lying and that doesn't exist.
[00:14:47.668 --> 00:14:49.349]  Because this is what they're doing.
[00:14:49.409 --> 00:14:50.910]  This is the season of takeover.
[00:14:51.190 --> 00:15:00.474]  This is when you expect stuff like this to happen and the key guy, when he doesn't have a security detail, drops dead and we're not supposed to question that.
[00:15:00.514 --> 00:15:07.877]  Well you know what, Donald Trump, and they figured it out, I have to give them credit, when Donald Trump came on this show,
[00:15:11.172 --> 00:15:14.034]  They knew that they would attack Trump and call him a 9-11 truther.
[00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:31.045]  And then, what would happen is, they would go look at everything I'd said and put it next to Trump, and then Trump would basically just say, all I'm saying is, I was in New York, and Bush says he saved us, he let this happen.
[00:15:32.517 --> 00:15:35.379]  And then it brings out 9-11 truth and absolutely trumps them.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:44.187]  And I was watching Cheney this morning in a re-airing interview that he had last night on Fox and he was saying, Trump wants to say we let it happen or maybe you are even behind it.
[00:15:44.447 --> 00:15:45.408]  And Cheney looks scared.
[00:15:48.671 --> 00:15:53.295]  Because the truth is, folks, they bare minimum stood down and bare minimum let Saudi Arabia attack us.
[00:15:53.495 --> 00:15:54.876]  And there was an Aurad stand down.
[00:15:55.116 --> 00:15:56.157]  That's been declassified.
[00:15:56.417 --> 00:15:57.939]  And six of the 10 commissioners
[00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:06.519]  Said there was a cover-up and that the 28 pages should be released and that it has the orders for the attacks to not be stopped.
[00:16:07.699 --> 00:16:11.020]  Cheney, Trump, way off base with 9-11 claims, doesn't know the facts.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.020]  And then he goes on to say, oh, it was Clinton's fault.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.120]  And Clinton admits it.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:14.941]  Oh, give me a break.
[00:16:14.981 --> 00:16:16.821]  Of course Clinton was protecting bin Laden.
[00:16:17.421 --> 00:16:19.021]  They're all owned by Saudi Arabia.
[00:16:19.101 --> 00:16:20.441]  And I want to be clear about something.
[00:16:20.461 --> 00:16:24.502]  It really hit me this morning on the elliptical watching Fox News.
[00:16:25.322 --> 00:16:28.683]  And I've articulated this, but I haven't done it properly and just crisply.
[00:16:29.747 --> 00:16:32.088]  I was going down rabbit trails, you know, documenting what I'm saying.
[00:16:32.608 --> 00:16:33.249]  I've already done that.
[00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:34.989]  Let me just lay it out.
[00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:41.112]  The CIA director is a known operative of Saudi Arabia.
[00:16:41.152 --> 00:16:43.893]  He's always seen in the Wahhabist garb.
[00:16:44.574 --> 00:16:51.297]  There's clear intel, he's been in mainstream news, that he's reportedly privately converted to radical Islam.
[00:16:52.571 --> 00:16:55.312]  Well, that's a double agent deal or whatever it really is.
[00:16:55.373 --> 00:16:57.334]  And you know, Bandar Bush is his nickname.
[00:16:57.574 --> 00:17:01.476]  One of the top princes always staying with the Bushes and saying how much they love each other.
[00:17:01.536 --> 00:17:06.158]  And Bandar Bush goes on Larry King Live two weeks after 9-11 and says, don't talk about bin Laden.
[00:17:06.538 --> 00:17:07.699]  He's a very honorable man.
[00:17:07.719 --> 00:17:14.663]  And then Bandar Bush threatens to attack the Russian Olympics a couple of years ago.
[00:17:16.345 --> 00:17:33.337]  So this is the type of stuff going on, and you've got them bringing them in to Syria, bringing them in to Libya, bringing them in to all these other countries like Egypt, overthrowing, then bringing them into Europe, so that when they attack, and now the CIA director says it's inevitable that there will be an attack,
[00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:35.021]  I don't know.
[00:17:53.235 --> 00:18:01.324]  The French and German and Dutch and British presidents and prime ministers will be called heroes even though they brought them in.
[00:18:01.464 --> 00:18:10.354]  They've been called heroes after the theater attack and the rock and roll show attacks and then took the French people's liberty and arrested right-wing leaders.
[00:18:11.135 --> 00:18:13.418]  Like their presidential frontrunner, Marie LePen!
[00:18:13.438 --> 00:18:15.381]  And you're like, yeah, but they brought him in.
[00:18:15.421 --> 00:18:16.022]  That's the whole point!
[00:18:16.483 --> 00:18:17.504]  And Trump's attacking that.
[00:18:17.524 --> 00:18:20.168]  He's saying, you keep saying I'm not tough on terror.
[00:18:20.468 --> 00:18:22.411]  You keep saying I wouldn't protect people.
[00:18:22.752 --> 00:18:26.036]  When I say we shouldn't have gone to Iraq, it isn't even the country that attacked us.
[00:18:26.176 --> 00:18:26.958]  It's Saudi Arabia.
[00:18:29.645 --> 00:18:31.547]  No, you didn't protect us after 9-11.
[00:18:31.907 --> 00:18:32.547]  You didn't protect us.
[00:18:32.567 --> 00:18:33.528]  You let 9-11 happen.
[00:18:33.688 --> 00:18:34.989]  That's come out in congressional hearings.
[00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:42.014]  Condoleezza Rice got caught lying in the National Security Memo saying there were no previous threats, no one had heard of a plan to hijack Jackson, fly them into buildings.
[00:18:42.255 --> 00:18:46.418]  We had FBI agents valiantly risking their lives, you better believe it.
[00:18:48.701 --> 00:19:04.466]  All over the US, in Texas, and in Arizona, and in Nevada, and in Illinois, and in Minnesota, coming out and saying they're going to attack the World Trade Center with hijacked planes, they're training, they're not learning how to land or take off.
[00:19:05.446 --> 00:19:10.628]  And then they ordered, at the White House level, under Clinton and the Bushes, to stop the investigations.
[00:19:10.888 --> 00:19:11.768]  That all came out.
[00:19:13.089 --> 00:19:14.049]  That all unfolded.
[00:19:15.385 --> 00:19:23.230]  So, Trump is just laying out the facts, baiting them to come and attack him as a 9-11 truther, and they just start hammering the daylights out of him.
[00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:27.932]  The guy has my respect totally now, and is in incredible danger.
[00:19:28.473 --> 00:19:33.556]  He is incredibly bold, and he's in ten times the danger I'm in, or Ron Paul, or somebody like that.
[00:19:33.856 --> 00:19:34.937]  I mean, he is incredible.
[00:19:36.117 --> 00:19:38.679]  And so are people like Matt Drudge and Clarence Thomas.
[00:19:41.624 --> 00:19:44.146]  So we're going to go to break, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:45.207 --> 00:19:52.935]  And we are going to come back and go over all of this, the latest on Scalia, the latest on 9-11, the latest on the economy, and so much more.

[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:44.400]  Croix River.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.721]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[00:22:46.941 --> 00:22:49.663]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:22:49.903 --> 00:22:50.423]  His excuse?
[00:22:50.783 --> 00:22:51.864]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:22:52.124 --> 00:22:53.405]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.

[00:24:22.791 --> 00:24:22.971]  Show!
[00:24:36.818 --> 00:24:39.260]  Steve Watson has an article up on Infowars.com.
[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:44.604]  Conservative host labels Trump a radical kook, close to being a 9-11 truther.
[00:24:45.105 --> 00:24:48.628]  Talking heads take swipes at anti-establishment frontrunner.
[00:24:48.888 --> 00:24:50.329]  And the whole article goes over that.
[00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:53.452]  Fox, CBS News, you name it.
[00:24:54.072 --> 00:25:00.137]  They are now basically coming out, other talk show hosts, and saying, oh my gosh, he's an evil 9-11 truther.
[00:25:00.517 --> 00:25:03.340]  Talk show host Mark Levin has labeled Trump a radical kook.
[00:25:04.974 --> 00:25:15.645]  You know, Levin says a lot of good things, and I don't want to sit here and be enemies with mainline conservatives because they're a million light years better than Bernie Sanders, who has now emerged, never had a job until he was 40.
[00:25:16.466 --> 00:25:18.248]  I mean, I'm 42.
[00:25:18.288 --> 00:25:19.409]  I had a job when I was 12.
[00:25:21.644 --> 00:25:25.325]  And I remember saying, there are child labor laws, Dad.
[00:25:25.345 --> 00:25:27.725]  I need to go get a job during the summer.
[00:25:27.745 --> 00:25:30.226]  I already mowed some yards and stuff.
[00:25:30.286 --> 00:25:32.447]  And he said, that's a bunch of baloney.
[00:25:32.747 --> 00:25:36.007]  You go down to the local marina, which was a mile from our house.
[00:25:36.027 --> 00:25:36.708]  We live in a lake.
[00:25:37.108 --> 00:25:41.169]  And you go ask those old guys in there and tell them, you want a job, you'll work for whatever they give you.
[00:25:41.389 --> 00:25:43.189]  If you actually do the job, you'll get a raise.
[00:25:43.569 --> 00:25:46.810]  And if you actually keep doing it, you'll have a job there years later and be a manager.
[00:25:47.506 --> 00:25:54.791]  And by the time, you know, two years had passed and I'd worked at the marina, during the summers, they were actually trying to hire me to be a manager at the marina when I was like 14.
[00:25:55.371 --> 00:25:57.993]  A manager at some of the boat stalls and stuff, keeping them clean.
[00:25:58.894 --> 00:26:01.295]  It's only 15 bucks an hour they offered me and I said no.
[00:26:03.657 --> 00:26:04.658]  It's just crazy.
[00:26:04.918 --> 00:26:06.179]  I can't imagine.
[00:26:09.124 --> 00:26:27.478]  I mean, by the time I was 16, I had big rolls of, you know, $20 bills in my pocket, was buying my own clothes, driving a nice used truck, taking girls out to movies, two, three nights a week, out to restaurants, and I just loved having a job.
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:33.343]  I loved leaving school and going to work for four or five hours.
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:46.771]  What a warped country where we're going to have a guy, the president, articles on Infowars.com where he admits, and you look at what a hippie freak he was, not having a job until he was 40 years old.
[00:26:46.791 --> 00:26:50.135]  These people live on another planet, man.
[00:26:50.155 --> 00:26:52.217]  I'm so sick of it.
[00:26:52.337 --> 00:26:52.837]  Excuse me.
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.261]  Point is, I
[00:26:58.524 --> 00:27:04.410]  I don't want to sit here and attack people like Martin Levin, but this new talking point is all over Fox News.
[00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:05.451]  In fact, I saw it this morning.
[00:27:05.791 --> 00:27:17.562]  Three times they said that he was basically a 9-11 truther or bordering on a 9-11 truther as if that's the worst thing in the world.
[00:27:17.863 --> 00:27:19.825]  And then they misrepresent what a 9-11 truther is.
[00:27:21.002 --> 00:27:24.483]  To someone that believes that the NYPD blew up the buildings.
[00:27:24.503 --> 00:27:27.145]  Because that's what they always say to make it sound like you're saying that.
[00:27:27.325 --> 00:27:28.325]  They built a straw man.
[00:27:30.126 --> 00:27:37.269]  Just like they say Donald Trump wanted $5 million for himself to be in a debate when he wanted $5 million given to the Wounded Warrior Program.
[00:27:38.869 --> 00:27:40.390]  He gave millions himself.
[00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:42.971]  That turns into he wants to steal veterans money.
[00:27:44.926 --> 00:27:45.887]  Well, you have a problem.
[00:27:45.967 --> 00:27:48.750]  Six of the ten commissioners say we've been lied to.
[00:27:48.931 --> 00:27:49.992]  There's smoking gun evidence.
[00:27:50.212 --> 00:27:51.253]  There was a stand down.
[00:27:51.674 --> 00:27:53.996]  I've had congressmen and senators on the show.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.261]  Former and current that have read it.
[00:27:56.561 --> 00:27:58.541]  Saudi Arabia ran the attacks.
[00:27:58.762 --> 00:28:01.483]  The FBI and NORAD were ordered to stand down.
[00:28:01.783 --> 00:28:04.244]  It will bring these governments down.
[00:28:04.524 --> 00:28:10.326]  That's why when Jeb Bush was asked about it by Richard Reeves last week in New Hampshire, his back went up straight.
[00:28:10.546 --> 00:28:18.170]  He got in the really aggressive gangster mode, not the friendly, hey, get in my yellow Volkswagen, Ted Bundy, you know, friendly con artist, serial killer mode.
[00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:20.390]  He switched into his real mode.
[00:28:20.591 --> 00:28:20.931]  Oh, really?
[00:28:20.971 --> 00:28:21.731]  Yeah, I do want to see that.
[00:28:21.851 --> 00:28:22.171]  Got him?
[00:28:22.191 --> 00:28:23.532]  I'd like to see him.
[00:28:24.397 --> 00:28:25.338]  That got right in Richard's face.
[00:28:25.418 --> 00:28:25.758]  Got him?
[00:28:26.358 --> 00:28:27.138]  Like to see him?
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:33.062]  You see it from the back that Richard was there and said he got right in his face.
[00:28:33.202 --> 00:28:33.522]  Got it?
[00:28:34.062 --> 00:28:37.064]  Turned his back to the camera and looked at him with hate and goes, like to see it.
[00:28:39.505 --> 00:28:40.826]  Oh, I bet you do want to see it.
[00:28:40.846 --> 00:28:45.088]  I bet you know all about it when you vacation at the Bin Laden family home in Riyadh.
[00:28:45.929 --> 00:28:48.770]  Or when your father vacations with him here in the United States.
[00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:53.433]  Or when your brother ordered that they be allowed to fly out of the country over the week that air traffic was grounded.
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:29:04.163]  I would cover local CBS pieces out of Miami where they had flight loads flying out and they would get on the news and say Alex Jones is lying and saying the Bin Ladens were flown out.
[00:29:04.523 --> 00:29:06.404]  It was in the Miami Herald!
[00:29:08.005 --> 00:29:09.185]  But they would say I was a liar.
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:15.361]  I'm going to come back and play some of these clips and finish up with this and get to the Trump clip, the Cheney clip, and the rest of it.
[00:29:15.381 --> 00:29:21.202]  But this is such a big deal, folks, that all Trump says is, you're saying I won't protect you from another 9-11?
[00:29:21.822 --> 00:29:24.383]  I'm trying to close the borders and kick the radical Muslims out.
[00:29:26.363 --> 00:29:29.504]  It was on Bush's watch that we got attacked.
[00:29:29.584 --> 00:29:32.045]  Why is he a hero when they let the attack happen?
[00:29:32.285 --> 00:29:34.445]  In business, if you screw up, you get fired.
[00:29:35.485 --> 00:29:37.266]  And they spin that, that he's a mainline 9-11 truther.
[00:29:39.272 --> 00:29:40.172]  As if that hurts him.
[00:29:40.573 --> 00:29:43.834]  Trump wants them to go into that briar patch and they're finally doing it.
[00:29:44.374 --> 00:29:45.475]  So just come on in.
[00:29:45.935 --> 00:29:46.835]  Just come on in.
[00:29:47.195 --> 00:29:49.416]  Grendel, sneak on into the hall.
[00:29:50.277 --> 00:29:52.918]  We're waiting for you.
[00:29:54.639 --> 00:29:57.520]  You're not gonna be able to run to mommy, are you?
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.900]  We're on the march.
[00:29:59.401 --> 00:30:01.001]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:01.922 --> 00:30:04.603]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.136 --> 00:30:23.135]  Russian warplanes are being blamed for carrying out what is being described as a deliberate attack on two makeshift hospitals and a school in northern Syria Monday that killed nearly 50 people, according to the United Nations, reports Fox News.
[00:30:24.036 --> 00:30:30.381]  Doctors Without Borders said that the hospital was hit four times in at least two attacks that were minutes apart.
[00:30:30.941 --> 00:30:36.065]  A third air raid hit a school in a nearby village, killing seven and wounding others.
[00:30:36.385 --> 00:30:45.392]  The Russian Prime Minister issued a blanket denial over the weekend that Moscow was targeting civilians in civilian facilities in Syria, reports The Guardian.
[00:30:45.732 --> 00:30:45.952]  U.S.
[00:30:45.992 --> 00:30:53.097]  Military Colonel Steve Warren on Twitter said the destruction of the Doctors Without Borders hospital was quote, terrible news.
[00:30:53.437 --> 00:30:54.758]  But last year, the U.S.
[00:30:54.818 --> 00:30:59.161]  itself hit a Doctors Without Borders facility in Afghanistan, killing 30 people.
[00:30:59.481 --> 00:31:01.842]  It was chalked up to a quote, human error.
[00:31:02.403 --> 00:31:05.284]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com

[00:33:15.382 --> 00:33:26.131]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:33:26.251 --> 00:33:31.635]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:33:32.175 --> 00:33:37.400]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.701]  It is a big idea.
[00:33:40.782 --> 00:33:41.703]  A new world order.
[00:33:45.265 --> 00:33:48.069]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.870]  It just pancaked.
[00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:56.121]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:14.967]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not the hands of criminals.
[00:34:19.515 --> 00:34:20.356]  Guns will be taken.
[00:34:20.396 --> 00:34:22.097]  No one will be able to be armed.
[00:34:22.157 --> 00:34:23.098]  We're going to take all guns.
[00:34:23.158 --> 00:34:27.902]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[00:34:27.962 --> 00:34:29.443]  Global governance at last.
[00:34:29.543 --> 00:34:30.504]  Is it one world?
[00:34:30.544 --> 00:34:32.185]  The central bank is in charge.
[00:34:32.225 --> 00:34:35.688]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:34:35.808 --> 00:34:39.511]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[00:34:42.077 --> 00:34:46.821]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:34:47.762 --> 00:34:49.283]  And we're live on this Tuesday.
[00:34:49.403 --> 00:34:50.564]  Worldwide transmission.
[00:34:50.624 --> 00:34:52.345]  Our reporters are in Southwest Texas.
[00:34:52.765 --> 00:34:54.667]  They did an incredible job driving down there last night.
[00:34:54.687 --> 00:34:56.708]  They've already interviewed one of the judges that was involved.
[00:34:57.049 --> 00:34:58.810]  They're interviewing the other judge as we speak.
[00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:01.492]  And they're going to go out to that ranch and get some answers.
[00:35:01.572 --> 00:35:03.093]  Something mainstream media won't do.
[00:35:03.614 --> 00:35:04.795]  I'll tell you what leadership is.
[00:35:04.895 --> 00:35:06.236]  I hit the barbed wire Saturday.
[00:35:07.708 --> 00:35:10.250]  And as usual, people are asking me, are you sure about doing this?
[00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:12.551]  And coming out and saying we should look into this as being a murder.
[00:35:13.372 --> 00:35:24.298]  And I said yes, under jurisprudence, under common law, under history, and under state and federal laws, the default has always been have an autopsy the more powerful a person is.
[00:35:24.859 --> 00:35:28.961]  It is unheard of to not do that when he didn't have a security detail.
[00:35:29.321 --> 00:35:33.044]  It is unheard of, when they keep changing the story, it is unheard of
[00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:37.873]  When you have judges making medical examiner announcements, and then changing them.
[00:35:38.873 --> 00:35:41.575]  I mean, this thing is so ridiculous.
[00:35:41.675 --> 00:35:47.419]  I don't just default, come out on air, and say that something stinks.
[00:35:50.761 --> 00:35:54.464]  You think I'm happy that there's about a 98% chance they killed Scalia?
[00:35:55.004 --> 00:35:56.785]  You think I want to be the one that breaks it?
[00:35:57.045 --> 00:35:59.387]  You think I want to be the one that runs over the top?
[00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:03.833]  The first one to go up against the machine gun nest, but I will do it.
[00:36:04.273 --> 00:36:08.118]  And I'm telling you this, in case something does happen to me, I need other people to step up.
[00:36:09.821 --> 00:36:10.942]  It's the only way to save your family.
[00:36:12.324 --> 00:36:17.090]  Now, we have the Associated Press, we have the New York Post, we have so many publications
[00:36:18.345 --> 00:36:21.526]  Today, it took two and a half days to break down their Berlin Wall.
[00:36:21.566 --> 00:36:23.206]  They wouldn't even mention an autopsy.
[00:36:23.226 --> 00:36:25.107]  They wouldn't even mention foul play.
[00:36:25.607 --> 00:36:28.228]  By Sunday, they started mentioning, why no autopsy?
[00:36:28.548 --> 00:36:29.268]  Then the pillow.
[00:36:30.008 --> 00:36:30.628]  Over the face.
[00:36:31.069 --> 00:36:34.249]  And now, we're going to cover this after I cover this other news.
[00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:38.571]  Detectives question lack of autopsy in Scalia death.
[00:36:39.051 --> 00:36:43.412]  New York Post, the head of the New York Homicide Squad,
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.942]  Says every default position was ignored.
[00:36:48.463 --> 00:36:49.924]  The story got changed a bunch.
[00:36:51.485 --> 00:36:52.266]  This is insane.
[00:36:54.107 --> 00:36:55.048]  Oh, I'm a kook!
[00:36:55.329 --> 00:37:00.193]  But the New York detective head of homicide says this is insane.
[00:37:00.513 --> 00:37:02.275]  They've got former intel operatives.
[00:37:02.295 --> 00:37:04.997]  They've got former... It's all over the place.
[00:37:05.037 --> 00:37:07.159]  Michael Savage says, looks like he was murdered.
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:09.661]  Oh, what does Michael Savage know?
[00:37:09.681 --> 00:37:10.442]  You know, he just made
[00:37:12.602 --> 00:37:21.870]  Billions of dollars in real estate and nutraceuticals and is the all-time best-selling author and pretty much launched the entire organic food movement under another name, another gnome diplom.
[00:37:23.111 --> 00:37:25.052]  What does a guy with probably a 200 IQ know?
[00:37:25.092 --> 00:37:25.993]  Let's not listen to him.
[00:37:27.534 --> 00:37:29.216]  Let's not listen to Alex Jones, the kook.
[00:37:29.616 --> 00:37:31.277]  Let's not listen to the police detective head.
[00:37:31.517 --> 00:37:36.261]  Let's just listen to CNN, because they just said he's dead, that's it, forget about it, move on.
[00:37:36.401 --> 00:37:37.042]  Well, you know what?
[00:37:37.342 --> 00:37:40.465]  We're not moving on because you said so.
[00:37:44.275 --> 00:37:46.636]  We're not moving on because you say you're God.
[00:37:49.857 --> 00:37:51.778]  We're not moving on because you call us names.
[00:37:53.938 --> 00:38:06.343]  When CBS and the Sydney Morning Herald call me a kook and a nut and, oh, he's... Do you have contacts that eat dinner with the Supreme Court justices and that say that total tyranny is coming in 2016 and watch out, they're coming after everyone?
[00:38:07.466 --> 00:38:09.147]  Oh no, you don't have those contacts.
[00:38:09.367 --> 00:38:13.610]  Do you talk to three former heads of Army Special Forces and people above that?
[00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:17.672]  Do you have the former head of Psychological Warfare for the State Department on?
[00:38:17.692 --> 00:38:19.633]  That overthrew seven countries.
[00:38:19.973 --> 00:38:21.514]  Do you live in the real world?
[00:38:21.895 --> 00:38:27.978]  Do you have Green Beret commanders, Delta Force people in studio, on air, that admire your work?
[00:38:28.338 --> 00:38:29.459]  No, you don't!
[00:38:29.859 --> 00:38:34.222]  You don't have anything but dishonor and the fact that you're slat-jaw scum!
[00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:40.535]  That sit there and repeat the same garbage that you're given in talking points over and over again.
[00:38:40.835 --> 00:38:42.917]  So get this through your heads, okay scum?
[00:38:45.359 --> 00:38:52.425]  You don't control the narrative anymore, and you're gonna be brought to justice when we take this country back for aiding and abetting a foreign takeover.
[00:38:52.665 --> 00:38:53.986]  And this is a foreign takeover.
[00:38:54.347 --> 00:38:55.367]  And you will fail.
[00:38:56.929 --> 00:38:58.070]  Just get that through your heads.
[00:39:06.428 --> 00:39:15.918]  Donald Trump represents factions in the government and in corporate America that don't want to bring the country down and don't want to enslave us and don't want to bankrupt us with Cloward and Piven.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.641]  I can tell you that.
[00:39:20.042 --> 00:39:25.067]  That's been signaled from high levels before we were ever contacted by the Trump people.
[00:39:27.665 --> 00:39:38.290]  And Donald Trump knows exactly what's going on, didn't know just five years ago, looks completely different, is totally freaked out, and basically sees himself on a suicide mission if you really want to get into inside baseball.
[00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:40.871]  Donald Trump is ready.
[00:39:40.891 --> 00:39:43.532]  He is full bore and just committed.
[00:39:44.733 --> 00:39:50.235]  And sure, you can call him an egomaniac, and the people that have assessed him say he's a good egomaniac, and he's the type we need.
[00:39:54.727 --> 00:39:56.068]  And they just admire him so much.
[00:39:56.128 --> 00:39:57.468]  These are high-level government people.
[00:39:58.749 --> 00:40:00.750]  You can put two and two together, CIA, you name it.
[00:40:02.391 --> 00:40:09.234]  And I mean the last generation that actually overthrew governments, actually did stuff on the ground, didn't just play around with a bunch of NSA spy gear.
[00:40:12.045 --> 00:40:17.711]  They understand the takedown of the country is happening right now, and they're not perfect, but they don't want to kill the United States of America.
[00:40:17.991 --> 00:40:29.142]  They don't have a score to settle like Loretta Lynch and Obama and Hillary, who want to mount the country's head on a wall and fully bankrupt us and end the country, and then have a war against everybody they don't control.
[00:40:30.865 --> 00:40:32.546]  The Democrats broke some big rules.
[00:40:32.966 --> 00:40:41.069]  What they did is they tried to basically merge both parties and started blackmailing everybody and said, we're not going to work together as parties anymore of corruption.
[00:40:41.389 --> 00:40:44.030]  We're going to consolidate power, which always happens in a tyranny.
[00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:46.251]  It always degenerates to this point.
[00:40:47.451 --> 00:40:53.113]  And now that point has been reached and all hell is breaking loose.
[00:40:54.854 --> 00:40:58.335]  You don't just think Scalia just died and that that's an isolated incident, do you?
[00:41:03.186 --> 00:41:07.189]  There is a war for this country going on at every level of government and corporate America right now.
[00:41:07.509 --> 00:41:10.352]  Why do you think the big mercenary outfits have left the US?
[00:41:13.194 --> 00:41:19.139]  I mean, the cloak and dagger level of what's going on is so seismic, I can hardly even broadcast.
[00:41:19.219 --> 00:41:20.960]  I'm so blown away.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.101]  It's not even freaked out.
[00:41:22.181 --> 00:41:24.143]  I'm just marveling.
[00:41:27.858 --> 00:41:33.300]  The headline is Pope Patriarch meet in Cuba nearly 1,000 years after the split.
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:34.680]  This was yesterday.
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:35.541]  We talked about it.
[00:41:35.561 --> 00:41:43.183]  A few days ago.
[00:41:47.885 --> 00:41:49.145]  And it didn't hardly get any coverage.
[00:41:51.746 --> 00:41:53.267]  No, actually, they've never met.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:42:01.622]  Both churches officially started showing up about a hundred years after the death of Christ and the resurrection.
[00:42:05.663 --> 00:42:07.704]  And they've been at each other's throats the entire time.
[00:42:11.225 --> 00:42:19.247]  And the fact that they're meeting lets you know, folks, that major earth-shaking events are about to happen.
[00:42:19.868 --> 00:42:21.148]  That is just one more indicator.
[00:42:23.598 --> 00:42:24.579]  And it's happening everywhere.
[00:42:24.619 --> 00:42:26.420]  The signs, the signs, the signs.
[00:42:27.821 --> 00:42:31.824]  Saudi Arabia announcing they've already begun invading Syria to fight up against Russian troops.
[00:42:32.144 --> 00:42:37.308]  And the word is they're using jihadis in Ukraine now against the Russians, with our government financing it.
[00:42:37.408 --> 00:42:41.691]  I mean, this is war crimes that make the head spin.
[00:42:42.031 --> 00:42:46.855]  And when all this comes out, that our illegitimate government did this, it will destroy our name forever.
[00:42:47.215 --> 00:42:49.977]  That's why the Pentagon, it came out under General Dempsey.
[00:42:51.198 --> 00:42:52.399]  We told you this before it was in the news.
[00:42:53.882 --> 00:42:54.622]  That's our sources!
[00:42:56.063 --> 00:43:05.206]  General Dempsey went to the White House when they were about to air bombard and take over Syria two years ago and said, the military is going to revolt, including top generals.
[00:43:05.526 --> 00:43:06.986]  We are not going to back Al Qaeda.
[00:43:07.006 --> 00:43:08.587]  We are not going to exterminate the Christians.
[00:43:08.947 --> 00:43:12.448]  We are giving intel to the Russians, who are already on the ground, to fight them.
[00:43:12.768 --> 00:43:13.869]  You're not doing this.
[00:43:15.269 --> 00:43:20.791]  And they let Dempsey sit there for a year and a half before they put his replacement in, but they did a purge of the top brass
[00:43:22.281 --> 00:43:25.462]  To try to make sure they can carry out the next phase, and now they're doing it.
[00:43:26.943 --> 00:43:30.764]  So, that's what's going on, boys and girls.
[00:43:30.924 --> 00:43:31.844]  That's what's happening.
[00:43:34.765 --> 00:43:35.826]  But you notice our victory.
[00:43:37.626 --> 00:43:44.569]  There should be an investigation and autopsy if someone is prominent, when it just comes in on a phone call that natural causes, now go to sleep.
[00:43:45.677 --> 00:43:53.059]  And they tried to act like I was a nut, Saturday and Sunday, and attacked me all over the place, and then notice it gave everybody else the cover.
[00:43:53.839 --> 00:44:06.443]  Police detectives, former intelligence operatives, other talk show hosts and people, to come out and go, well there was a pillow over his face, well they did change the story over and over again, well the Democrats were celebrating his death, why shouldn't we look into this?
[00:44:09.524 --> 00:44:09.764]  You see?
[00:44:11.025 --> 00:44:12.766]  And I'm not up here bragging about what I did.
[00:44:12.786 --> 00:44:19.712]  I'm giving you, other talk show hosts, other media people, just a lesson in leadership.
[00:44:21.093 --> 00:44:27.378]  You cannot, when you know you're doing the right thing, sit around and wait for other people to get behind you before you step out first.
[00:44:28.278 --> 00:44:31.201]  You've got to be the person that sticks their head up first.
[00:44:31.881 --> 00:44:33.823]  You've got to be the person that leads the charge.
[00:44:34.203 --> 00:44:34.663]  You understand that?
[00:44:34.683 --> 00:44:36.685]  That's what we're looking for here is leadership.
[00:44:38.166 --> 00:45:04.978]  The only reason I'm so prominent, the only reason I get so many of the leaks and so much of the intel, the good intel, is because people know I've been around 20 plus years, they know where I came from, they know who I am, they know who my family is, that we're as American as it gets, continually committed to this country, and we will never sell out anybody, we will never screw over little people, we will never oppress people, we will fight for freedom until the death, and that's it!
[00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:09.331]  Now who else is going to join us in this fight?
[00:45:10.152 --> 00:45:12.394]  That's what I'm asking you right now, because this isn't a game.
[00:45:13.895 --> 00:45:15.836]  We have succeeded in waking up a lot of people.
[00:45:17.117 --> 00:45:19.558]  But we've not yet removed the globalists, and we're far from it.
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.641]  And this is a serious battle.
[00:45:28.364 --> 00:45:30.666]  I want to get into the rest of the 9-11 news and back into Scalia.
[00:45:30.686 --> 00:45:31.747]  I haven't even got into it yet.
[00:45:36.237 --> 00:45:38.279]  Before I go any further, fund our operation right now.
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:42.524]  I'm not going to belabor this because of the seriousness of where the world is right now.
[00:45:44.195 --> 00:45:53.043]  I'm just going to say that we sell what we believe are the best liberty-based t-shirts to spread the word and awaken folks and to meet like-minded people in your area, and it funds our operation.
[00:45:53.063 --> 00:45:54.084]  It's a total 360 win.
[00:45:54.364 --> 00:45:57.988]  We have the best non-GMO heirloom seeds, the widest selection.
[00:45:58.028 --> 00:46:00.390]  We're constantly adding other great companies to our list.
[00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:08.858]  Our goal is to have the biggest, widest, most inexpensive selection of high-quality non-GMO heirloom seeds, from fruit trees down to corn.
[00:46:10.655 --> 00:46:13.737]  To tobacco, to just everything, you name it, we got it.
[00:46:13.838 --> 00:46:15.078]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:19.262]  And we bring you the best nutraceuticals, period.
[00:46:20.142 --> 00:46:22.104]  Like Survival Shield Nacin Iodine X2.
[00:46:22.404 --> 00:46:23.104]  Changed my life.
[00:46:23.405 --> 00:46:24.105]  The good halogen.
[00:46:24.165 --> 00:46:27.568]  I was definitely, didn't have the proper type of iodine, wasn't absorbing what I was getting.
[00:46:29.429 --> 00:46:30.170]  Anthroplex.
[00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:35.194]  Total foundational booster to super male or super female vitality is sold out.
[00:46:35.214 --> 00:46:38.056]  We're having to now hold it back for those that are signed up for AutoShep.

[00:46:54.082 --> 00:46:58.546]  In my view, it's just a souped-up version, but this is much more affordable, and I think at many levels, this is good.
[00:46:58.766 --> 00:47:01.208]  It has some added herbs that are known to turbocharge things as well.
[00:47:01.509 --> 00:47:05.532]  Trianthroplex is excellent, but Supramel, Superfemale Vitality, you've absolutely got to try them.

[00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:18.423]  There's a reason I take Survival Shield X2 Nacin Iodine every day.
[00:47:19.204 --> 00:47:21.066]  The other stuff I tried would eat a hole in my gut, folks.
[00:47:21.947 --> 00:47:23.368]  And ours is real.
[00:47:23.668 --> 00:47:25.470]  It turns purple-blue on paper, not red.
[00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:26.731]  That's the color of real iodine.

[00:48:56.215 --> 00:48:58.736]  I want to finally say please support our local MF affiliates.

[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:13.102]  Now I'm going to settle down and just finish up with the 9-11 information.
[00:49:14.063 --> 00:49:18.245]  Then I'm going to get into Scalia and then of course we have a bunch of guests coming on today as well.
[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:22.862]  But as we prepare to go out to break, I mentioned this yesterday, but we played a different clip.
[00:49:23.582 --> 00:49:39.191]  This is the CIA Director Brennan, who lives in Saudi Arabia for much of his life and runs around in Wahhabist outfits and does everything he can to empower al-Qaeda and give them weapons, but claims he's got to take our rights away because it's imminent and that it's a near certainty.
[00:49:41.172 --> 00:49:42.433]  What's the exact word he uses?
[00:49:42.453 --> 00:49:45.815]  The exact word is... Well, let's go ahead and play the clip and hear what he had to say.
[00:49:47.526 --> 00:49:48.647]  Is ISIS coming here?
[00:49:49.027 --> 00:49:53.530]  I think ISIL does want to eventually find its mark here.
[00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:55.851]  You're expecting an attack in the United States?
[00:49:56.332 --> 00:50:07.879]  I'm expecting them to try to put in place the operatives, the material or whatever else that they need to do or to incite people to carry out these attacks clearly.
[00:50:08.359 --> 00:50:10.960]  So I believe that their attempts are inevitable.
[00:50:11.441 --> 00:50:13.242]  I don't think their successes necessarily are.
[00:50:14.022 --> 00:50:18.844]  Okay, so it's inevitable they're going to try to attack, like San Bernardino or all these other attacks you guys say are terrorism.
[00:50:20.505 --> 00:50:25.087]  And he's sitting there with his stuffed shirt, with his fake reporter thing.
[00:50:25.167 --> 00:50:26.188]  ISIS will try to attack us?
[00:50:26.388 --> 00:50:33.471]  This is our government, hijacked government, arming them, defending them, and blaming Assad for chemical attacks they've launched.
[00:50:33.532 --> 00:50:36.313]  Now Brennan admits, no, actually they launched a chemical attack.
[00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:38.730]  So it's very simple.
[00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:39.851]  They're going to let them attack.
[00:50:39.871 --> 00:50:40.971]  They're bringing in the refugees.
[00:50:40.991 --> 00:50:41.732]  They're not vetting them.
[00:50:42.092 --> 00:50:44.413]  They say it's 600 to something the last month brought in.
[00:50:45.093 --> 00:50:48.435]  Folks, they brought in thousands to Austin from Syria alone.
[00:50:48.575 --> 00:50:49.495]  That's on the news.
[00:50:50.796 --> 00:50:57.059]  I mean, they are just lying to everyone because they're an occupying force and we're the enemy.
[00:50:58.079 --> 00:50:59.140]  Have you figured that out yet?
[00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:07.364]  We're treated like an enemy shutting down our power plants, saying our families are bad, raising taxes, harassing us, going after farmers because we're the enemy.
[00:51:09.181 --> 00:51:12.365]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?
[00:51:12.785 --> 00:51:14.587]  How would you like to never be cold again?
[00:51:14.607 --> 00:51:21.214]  This is Dale with Fortress Clothing, and I'm here to tell you, you will never be cold again with Fortress.

[00:52:08.413 --> 00:52:11.154]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[00:52:11.474 --> 00:52:14.074]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[00:52:14.094 --> 00:52:14.534]  Croix River.
[00:52:14.855 --> 00:52:16.855]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[00:52:17.075 --> 00:52:19.796]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:52:20.036 --> 00:52:20.556]  His excuse?
[00:52:20.916 --> 00:52:21.996]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:52:22.256 --> 00:52:23.537]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[00:52:23.857 --> 00:52:29.358]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[00:53:08.183 --> 00:53:11.706]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:53:12.426 --> 00:53:12.947]  It's true.
[00:53:13.067 --> 00:53:17.010]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:19.071]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:53:19.612 --> 00:53:24.075]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[00:54:20.625 --> 00:54:34.616]  Oh my gosh, Larry Nichols, the big Clinton insider, who knows a lot of the top folks in Washington on record.
[00:54:34.856 --> 00:54:37.398]  And the Clintons have said, even the New York Times, they're scared of Larry Nichols.
[00:54:38.459 --> 00:54:41.582]  I figured I needed to talk to him to see what he knew about Scalia's death.
[00:54:44.389 --> 00:54:51.171]  I don't know if he's going to get into this on air yet, but it's just over-the-top stuff, and I just, I wish I didn't even have to know all this!
[00:54:52.772 --> 00:55:09.918]  And I wish the general public, not you the listeners, folks that are looking for the truth, are informed in many cases more than I am, but I just wish the general public, you go look at young people nowadays, there's a lot of great smart young people of every race, color, and creed, but you look at them and they look so sheep-like.
[00:55:11.058 --> 00:55:12.279]  People look so weak.
[00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:20.334]  And then I see the guys that think they're tough, but you talk to them and they have no intellectual information.
[00:55:21.254 --> 00:55:22.075]  They have no rudder.
[00:55:22.135 --> 00:55:23.416]  They have no place they came from.
[00:55:25.397 --> 00:55:31.281]  So I used to bash guys that tried to act tough and that ride around on motorcycles and everything and, you know, thinking they were like the phony.
[00:55:33.097 --> 00:55:34.098]  You know, the phony tough.
[00:55:34.918 --> 00:55:41.043]  But I realize they're, you know, they are probably tough and they just don't have any background and they're trying to look for something to be a man.
[00:55:41.423 --> 00:55:43.204]  Well, if you want to be a man, now's the time.
[00:55:43.965 --> 00:55:45.306]  And it means getting in front of people.
[00:55:45.346 --> 00:55:47.668]  It means going to the city council and speaking out.
[00:55:47.748 --> 00:55:48.088]  I mean, look.
[00:55:52.293 --> 00:55:56.575]  I didn't have any skills when I was 19 and started going and speaking to city council and county commissioners.
[00:55:56.996 --> 00:56:02.919]  All I knew is they were trying to pass stuff and do things at the city and state level that was violating the Constitution and my rights.
[00:56:03.439 --> 00:56:04.540]  And I felt threatened by it.
[00:56:06.141 --> 00:56:08.382]  I was a fighter all my life before that.
[00:56:08.422 --> 00:56:11.364]  I didn't realize what it was all meant for.
[00:56:12.384 --> 00:56:13.485]  But I wasn't going to roll over.
[00:56:13.965 --> 00:56:16.447]  And it wasn't because I was looking for a fight or had something to prove.
[00:56:17.327 --> 00:56:20.149]  I knew instinctively I had to stand up or I'd be a slave.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:24.562]  And I just ask, where is that basic instinct in people?
[00:56:26.483 --> 00:56:31.327]  Where is this idea that you lay down and then you get away with stuff and then nothing ever happens to you?
[00:56:32.568 --> 00:56:34.509]  A nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves.
[00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:41.654]  Coming up in the next hour, just a few minutes away, Larry Nichols, then Richard Reeves from South Carolina, our political correspondent, and so much more.
[00:56:43.435 --> 00:56:50.741]  Then our reporters from the ground in southwest Texas on a dangerous mission to go down there and investigate the death of Scalia.
[00:56:52.133 --> 00:57:01.560]  I've talked to some of the establishment folks, and that is people big in the media who were at the establishment level, and they are concerned.
[00:57:04.762 --> 00:57:10.386]  Obviously, and you know, folks see this for what it is, it's about a 98% chance, 97% chance it was he was killed.
[00:57:13.728 --> 00:57:15.449]  But we're going out to break here since I mentioned 9-11.
[00:57:17.574 --> 00:57:28.292]  I thought I'd mention Senator Murphy from Connecticut, because I mentioned this 30 minutes ago, saying they're trying to pass worldwide martial law powers for the President in the military authorization legislation.
[00:57:28.873 --> 00:57:30.636]  And so I wanted to play that clip.
[00:57:30.656 --> 00:57:30.916]  Here it is.
[00:57:32.082 --> 00:57:32.382]  I think?
[00:57:48.087 --> 00:57:54.049]  That apparently purports to give the President legal authority to conduct military operations against ISIS.
[00:57:54.650 --> 00:58:08.535]  Before we break for the weekend, Madam President, I thought it was important to come to the floor to explain why, very briefly, to my colleagues, excuse me, to explain what this resolution really is.
[00:58:10.155 --> 00:58:11.216]  This resolution
[00:58:12.176 --> 00:58:12.316]  Yes.
[00:58:27.882 --> 00:58:28.283]  All right.
[00:58:28.303 --> 00:58:28.703]  That is U.S.
[00:58:28.743 --> 00:58:30.464]  Senator Christopher Murphy.
[00:58:30.484 --> 00:58:31.946]  We'll be back with a second hour.
[00:58:31.966 --> 00:58:33.007]  Stay with us.
[00:58:33.247 --> 00:58:35.129]  That's just the climate we're in, folks.
[00:58:35.149 --> 00:58:38.472]  If you stop it like that, it's not even news now.
[00:58:53.268 --> 00:59:02.734]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[00:59:03.074 --> 00:59:07.697]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:59:07.838 --> 00:59:08.858]  Talk about the effects.
[00:59:09.178 --> 00:59:10.659]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:59:10.679 --> 00:59:12.300]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:59:12.601 --> 00:59:13.661]  I feel like I look better.
[00:59:13.721 --> 00:59:14.382]  I feel better.
[00:59:14.442 --> 00:59:15.462]  I feel sexier.
[00:59:15.482 --> 00:59:16.203]  I love it.
[00:59:16.463 --> 00:59:19.364]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[00:59:19.424 --> 00:59:22.145]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[00:59:22.365 --> 00:59:23.405]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:59:23.445 --> 00:59:24.486]  Consult your physician.

[01:00:01.037 --> 01:00:03.647]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:23.209 --> 01:00:25.290]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:35.574]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:00:36.014 --> 01:00:39.175]  Well, huge developments with our teams on the ground.
[01:00:39.215 --> 01:00:39.996]  I say teams.
[01:00:40.536 --> 01:00:44.337]  We have two different teams in southwest Texas right now.
[01:00:44.397 --> 01:00:48.519]  Wayne Madsen is already in El Paso, investigative journalist.
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:54.584]  I'm so proud to have somebody like that on the payroll here, because he's worked for some of the biggest newspapers in the country.
[01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:57.406]  A real bona fide investigative journalist.
[01:00:57.947 --> 01:01:02.771]  He is on the ground, has already talked to the embalmer of Scalia and more.
[01:01:02.831 --> 01:01:04.152]  So now we're going to learn some stuff.
[01:01:04.172 --> 01:01:06.774]  We never told what happened once he got to El Paso.
[01:01:07.595 --> 01:01:08.656]  Then he was flown out to Virginia.
[01:01:08.696 --> 01:01:10.217]  We're going to have info for you.
[01:01:10.478 --> 01:01:11.719]  Michael Savage said yesterday,
[01:01:12.691 --> 01:01:13.892]  We had him on back there in the office.
[01:01:14.153 --> 01:01:15.354]  I said, let's see what Savage is doing.
[01:01:15.414 --> 01:01:15.754]  Turn it on.
[01:01:16.415 --> 01:01:17.516]  This looks like a murder to me.
[01:01:17.576 --> 01:01:18.978]  The cowardly media won't investigate.
[01:01:19.018 --> 01:01:19.999]  The police won't investigate.
[01:01:20.279 --> 01:01:21.020]  Where are the journalists?
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.783]  And then we emailed him, and he's invited me on many times.
[01:01:23.843 --> 01:01:27.426]  And we said, hey, you want to have David Nutter, Joe Biggs on your show today?
[01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:31.400]  You can say, Michael Savage reporters, we don't even care about the credit.
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:36.043]  We just want to get, of course it's nice and he'll give us credit, but we just don't care about the credit.
[01:01:36.303 --> 01:01:36.864]  Neither does he.
[01:01:37.244 --> 01:01:39.386]  Michael Savage doesn't need money being a radio host.
[01:01:40.026 --> 01:01:41.847]  He's a very successful entrepreneur in his own right.
[01:01:42.308 --> 01:01:44.289]  And he's doing this because he cares about the country.
[01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:47.972]  And he's not perfect, I'm not perfect, it's not about that.
[01:01:48.272 --> 01:01:52.335]  The point is, is that he's saying, yeah, where's the media, where's the coverage, where's the investigation?
[01:01:53.157 --> 01:01:56.198]  Twenty years ago, you'd have a hundred news trucks down there a day later.
[01:01:56.958 --> 01:02:00.679]  You'd have folks talking about what you saw, what went on, why isn't there an autopsy.
[01:02:00.939 --> 01:02:03.380]  Now they say it's bad to even ask for an autopsy.
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:05.060]  You see?
[01:02:06.041 --> 01:02:10.622]  Because we have a judge say that she says he died naturally because she heard it over a telephone.
[01:02:12.803 --> 01:02:17.084]  Maybe she can tell us what the weather is going to be next week because she's a meteorologist now without reading the newspaper.
[01:02:21.243 --> 01:02:25.850]  So we've got him and Wayne Madsen in El Paso.
[01:02:26.771 --> 01:02:28.413]  He's going to be popping in in the third hour.
[01:02:28.854 --> 01:02:34.722]  And then we also have Joe Biggs, David Knight, Josh Owens, who have already interviewed one of the judges.
[01:02:34.762 --> 01:02:35.944]  Now they're interviewing the second judge.
[01:02:36.224 --> 01:02:36.845]  And then they're going to be
[01:02:38.424 --> 01:02:39.805]  Talking to folks at the ranch very, very soon.
[01:02:39.825 --> 01:02:42.426]  I'll just leave it to you at that.
[01:02:42.886 --> 01:02:48.068]  In fact, I'm almost tempted to not have them hang out and wait to be on the show and just get the mission on down the road.
[01:02:48.809 --> 01:02:50.509]  But I want them to also be able to report.
[01:02:50.529 --> 01:02:53.811]  So I'll just get to them quick and then go on.
[01:02:54.151 --> 01:02:54.791]  Here's the problem.
[01:02:54.831 --> 01:02:58.073]  You get to some of the so-called larger towns and they barely have internet.
[01:02:59.151 --> 01:03:01.312]  Uh, where this ranch is, there is no internet.
[01:03:01.832 --> 01:03:02.972]  There's barely cell phone.
[01:03:03.352 --> 01:03:04.532]  I've been out in the general area.
[01:03:04.572 --> 01:03:08.994]  In fact, I've been a few miles from this ranch, and I've been all over that area since I was, you know, three years old.
[01:03:09.014 --> 01:03:12.494]  Uh, that's where we go vacation since I was a kid, so I know it well.
[01:03:13.575 --> 01:03:21.257]  And it's built up a lot to what it was 35 years ago, 37 years ago, 40 years ago when I was down there.
[01:03:21.277 --> 01:03:25.698]  And of course, I was just down there last year, twice, but
[01:03:26.784 --> 01:03:33.708]  It's creepy when you're out in the middle of a mountainous desert and your cell phone won't work for a hundred miles in all directions.
[01:03:35.088 --> 01:03:43.432]  You just get used to having that cell phone and then when you don't have it, it's like being back in the 1980s or 70s where all you got is a CB and it doesn't work either.
[01:03:43.492 --> 01:03:44.373]  It is creepy.
[01:03:45.558 --> 01:03:52.743]  And poor old Scalia, in my view, we need to investigate it, walked into a very mysterious set of circumstances.
[01:03:53.103 --> 01:03:59.027]  And it's only gotten more mysterious and more Agatha Christie since then.
[01:04:00.268 --> 01:04:01.829]  And that's why you got the headlines now.
[01:04:02.209 --> 01:04:03.029]  Oh, I'm a kook.
[01:04:03.129 --> 01:04:07.212]  I'm a crazy guy Saturday saying they came out too quick with the info.
[01:04:07.312 --> 01:04:08.393]  They better have an autopsy.
[01:04:08.413 --> 01:04:09.513]  Oh, of course he's on an autopsy.
[01:04:09.533 --> 01:04:10.714]  Oh, there's a pillow over his face.
[01:04:12.255 --> 01:04:13.236]  They're changing the stories.
[01:04:13.296 --> 01:04:13.976]  Wasn't a heart attack.
[01:04:13.996 --> 01:04:14.797]  They're not gonna tell us what.
[01:04:17.227 --> 01:04:22.851]  This is like catching a guy in a black mask in your bedroom, robbing your wife's jewelry, and you say, hey buddy, what are you doing?
[01:04:22.871 --> 01:04:23.331]  He goes, nothing!
[01:04:23.351 --> 01:04:24.852]  But you're wearing a black mask.
[01:04:25.153 --> 01:04:26.193]  These aren't your wife's jewels.
[01:04:26.534 --> 01:04:28.355]  You go, those aren't my wife's jewels.
[01:04:29.235 --> 01:04:30.496]  These aren't the droids you're looking for.
[01:04:30.717 --> 01:04:31.717]  Move along, move along.
[01:04:32.017 --> 01:04:34.559]  And they try that with people, and it just doesn't work with me.
[01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:40.644]  If they'd have said, we don't know, we're going to have an autopsy, blah, blah, blah, I'd say, well, he might have died, naturally.
[01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:42.365]  But not the way they acted.
[01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:45.070]  We're going to go to break here in about 20 seconds.
[01:04:45.671 --> 01:04:49.672]  Detectives question lack of autopsy in Scalia death.
[01:04:50.452 --> 01:04:51.912]  Oh, that's the New York Post.
[01:04:52.232 --> 01:04:59.994]  Oh, the Daily Mail, the Associated Press, the head of the Homicide Investigations Group in Washington, D.C.
[01:05:00.014 --> 01:05:00.554]  has come out.
[01:05:00.674 --> 01:05:03.495]  I saw another one where it was in New York questioning it.
[01:05:03.535 --> 01:05:04.915]  So that's two.
[01:05:04.975 --> 01:05:06.315]  I was conflating the two.
[01:05:06.876 --> 01:05:08.236]  Oh, these are evil detectives, though.
[01:05:09.554 --> 01:05:20.822]  We have previously seen 3D printing technology bring us things like simple household items, more advanced components of firearms, and now it's being reported that they can even produce body parts.
[01:05:21.323 --> 01:05:33.432]  A team at Wake Forest University has used a combination of living cells and a special gel to print out human body parts, including ears, muscles, and jaw bones, reports NBC News.
[01:05:33.772 --> 01:05:44.941]  It's an advance on previous attempts which either involved making a plastic scaffold and then trying to get cells to grow in and on it or that printed out organ shapes that ended up being too floppy and dying.
[01:05:45.241 --> 01:05:52.487]  The new approach mixes live cells with a gel that starts out as liquid but quickly hardens to the consistency of living tissue.
[01:05:52.747 --> 01:05:55.510]  The challenge of making living tissue is complicated.
[01:05:55.870 --> 01:06:01.895]  Even a simple structure like an ear has several types of cells and they must all be fed by tiny capillaries.

[01:07:12.168 --> 01:07:18.310]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:25.472]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.

[01:07:41.058 --> 01:07:45.821]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:07:45.881 --> 01:07:49.243]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[01:08:10.072 --> 01:08:13.013]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[01:08:13.193 --> 01:08:16.994]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[01:08:18.234 --> 01:08:24.275]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[01:08:24.295 --> 01:08:27.336]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[01:08:27.376 --> 01:08:30.656]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate.
[01:08:31.556 --> 01:08:33.897]  And I hope that judge ain't blind.
[01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:52.282]  Alright, that's George Strait bringing us in with an oldie but a goodie.
[01:08:52.382 --> 01:08:53.263]  Amarillo by morning.
[01:08:54.664 --> 01:08:55.605]  Up from San Antone.
[01:08:58.058 --> 01:09:17.634]  And we are joined for the next 30 minutes by Larry Nichols, former Special Operations Green Beret and Clandestine Operations, recruited into governmental operations in Arkansas, which are actually national operations for the Dixie Mafia run out of Arkansas.
[01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:19.575]  And that's a government-integrated group, just so you know.
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:26.064]  For the folks that aren't in on that information, I can tell you that personally from what I know about Austin, Texas and the history here.
[01:09:26.845 --> 01:09:28.586]  And so he got into the inside of it.
[01:09:28.626 --> 01:09:30.367]  He was the guy behind the Clinton Chronicles.
[01:09:31.088 --> 01:09:34.510]  He's the person in the New York Times that the Clintons say they fear the most.
[01:09:35.231 --> 01:09:36.072]  And we should pray for him.
[01:09:36.092 --> 01:09:37.293]  He's battling cancer right now.
[01:09:37.333 --> 01:09:38.313]  He's a tough old egg.
[01:09:38.974 --> 01:09:42.677]  And he joins us on Clarence Thomas.
[01:09:44.118 --> 01:09:44.898]  Is he in danger?
[01:09:45.879 --> 01:09:47.020]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:48.181]  See what he has to say about it.
[01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:53.276]  And how that ties into the Scalia situation.
[01:09:54.617 --> 01:09:59.999]  We have Anthony Scalia dying in obviously very suspicious circumstances.
[01:10:00.039 --> 01:10:01.859]  And first I want to get Larry Nichols' take on that.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.260]  What is inside Intel is, if any.
[01:10:06.041 --> 01:10:13.083]  And then we're going to get into the election as well and what this signifies if this is a hit.
[01:10:13.784 --> 01:10:17.185]  Now the good news is, since I came out first Saturday and said,
[01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:23.915]  Them announcing that he died right away of natural causes with no proof with an anonymous phone call is over-the-top suspicious.
[01:10:24.796 --> 01:10:31.543]  And if they say no autopsy quickly, you know that it's a 90-something percent chance that they killed him.
[01:10:33.336 --> 01:10:35.998]  Well, the next morning the judge comes in and says there's going to be no autopsy.
[01:10:36.498 --> 01:10:42.181]  I mean, they are acting as guilty as catching your kid up on the counter with their hand in the cookie jar.
[01:10:42.602 --> 01:10:42.862]  Okay?
[01:10:42.922 --> 01:10:45.664]  Or you walk in on your wife, you know, in bed and her legs behind her ears.
[01:10:45.724 --> 01:10:48.786]  I mean, this is... I don't mean to talk like that, folks, but this is bad, okay?
[01:10:50.587 --> 01:10:52.908]  And they look up at you and they say, there's nothing going on here.
[01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:58.872]  Now that might work in movies like Star Wars where Obi-Wan Kenobi says, these aren't the droids you're looking for, but...
[01:10:59.830 --> 01:11:05.093]  This is the most over-the-top ridiculousness I've seen since Fannie Malick, the Arkansas medical examiner.
[01:11:05.113 --> 01:11:09.154]  You'd find people with their arms and legs cut off in trash bags and he'd rule it suicide.
[01:11:09.855 --> 01:11:13.617]  Folks, you can't chop your arms and legs off and put yourself in a trash can, okay?
[01:11:14.497 --> 01:11:20.100]  So, I want to believe he died of natural causes, but he's the one key guy holding it all back.
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:24.862]  But now, former New York top homicide squad detective's gone public.
[01:11:26.773 --> 01:11:35.175]  And the top detectives currently, former and current, the whole groups are coming out saying the defaults are being ignored in DC saying that.
[01:11:36.096 --> 01:11:38.016]  And the police I know are saying absolutely.
[01:11:38.056 --> 01:11:46.058]  I mean I talked to a police officer this morning that I ran into that I know through his brother and he said oh my gosh everybody sees right through this.
[01:11:46.098 --> 01:11:47.779]  I mean this is ridiculous.
[01:11:48.959 --> 01:11:49.960]  I'm going to get Nichols' view.
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.701]  I haven't talked to him since this happened.
[01:11:52.081 --> 01:11:53.542]  I couldn't get a hold of him yesterday.
[01:11:53.843 --> 01:11:54.943]  He said he could come on today.
[01:11:55.003 --> 01:11:59.447]  He joins us to go over this and I appreciate him coming on.
[01:11:59.467 --> 01:12:04.570]  We've got former intel officers, CIA people coming out saying it stinks to high heaven, Michael Savage saying it.
[01:12:05.251 --> 01:12:10.755]  So they've tried to shut down any discussion of this or even a discussion of why isn't there an autopsy.
[01:12:11.598 --> 01:12:12.438]  But it's not working.
[01:12:12.678 --> 01:12:15.059]  They've now changed the story more than 10 times.
[01:12:15.819 --> 01:12:17.479]  So Larry Nichols, God bless you my friend.
[01:12:17.539 --> 01:12:18.960]  Thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:20.780]  You bet, Alex.
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.701]  Thanks for having me, buddy.
[01:12:23.961 --> 01:12:27.002]  I see you got a tracheotomy there, brother.
[01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:29.322]  Boy, I tell you, your tougher than nails to be able to come on the air with us.
[01:12:30.483 --> 01:12:32.223]  Well, I'll be here.
[01:12:32.303 --> 01:12:35.464]  I'll be here until the match between me and Hillary.
[01:12:36.164 --> 01:12:37.384]  I'll be around until that one.
[01:12:38.044 --> 01:12:38.845]  I promise you that.
[01:12:38.985 --> 01:12:39.965]  We're praying for you, brother.
[01:12:40.538 --> 01:12:40.958]  Thank you.
[01:12:41.058 --> 01:12:47.082]  You know, this time yesterday, Alex, I had not talked to anyone and I was cautioning everyone.
[01:12:47.722 --> 01:12:48.843]  Everyone, be careful.
[01:12:50.364 --> 01:12:52.085]  You know, true definition of a patriot.
[01:12:52.445 --> 01:12:54.846]  I believe Alex is one that seeks out the truth.
[01:12:56.027 --> 01:13:03.631]  And I wanted to be certain of the truth before I did the program with you or anybody else about Scalia.
[01:13:05.913 --> 01:13:07.974]  Unfortunately, just about an hour ago,
[01:13:09.116 --> 01:13:14.581]  Some of the information I'm getting, I mean, I'm just going to be honest, guys, this thing's starting to reek.
[01:13:14.701 --> 01:13:15.322]  I have it now.
[01:13:15.442 --> 01:13:17.604]  I'm not saying, Alex, I have any proof.
[01:13:18.645 --> 01:13:19.646]  I hope everyone hears me.
[01:13:19.686 --> 01:13:25.331]  I'm not saying I have proof that there was anything evil, sinister done to him.
[01:13:26.732 --> 01:13:32.938]  But some of the stuff that I'm getting now is showing signs very reminiscent
[01:13:33.436 --> 01:13:35.117]  Of the old Clinton days around here.
[01:13:35.458 --> 01:13:37.819]  You know, like you said, the Fannie Malick days.
[01:13:37.879 --> 01:13:38.900]  People don't remember that.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:39.400]  I do.
[01:13:39.521 --> 01:13:40.821]  I remember it very well.
[01:13:41.682 --> 01:13:48.027]  And we're in a situation with Scalia to where this thing's burning out of control.
[01:13:48.427 --> 01:13:49.928]  Now, who did it?
[01:13:49.968 --> 01:13:51.069]  Why did they do it?
[01:13:51.369 --> 01:14:00.676]  If it was done, all I can tell you, Alex, is usually when it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it's going to be a duck.
[01:14:02.119 --> 01:14:03.560]  And I'm afraid that's where we're headed.
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:05.921]  But let's not forget one thing.
[01:14:06.681 --> 01:14:12.844]  There are two important things that are going to affect the career, the future of this nation forever.
[01:14:13.584 --> 01:14:19.287]  That's the election for the presidency and now the appointment of the Supreme Court Justice.
[01:14:20.467 --> 01:14:24.829]  So you tell me, what does it look like to you?
[01:14:25.289 --> 01:14:26.690]  What does it look like now?
[01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:29.371]  Election wise, we've got to stay focused.
[01:14:29.932 --> 01:14:30.372]  But who?
[01:14:30.553 --> 01:14:35.957]  Remember what we used to do, Alex, with the old Clinton days, with the Arkansides, as we called them in the day?
[01:14:36.337 --> 01:14:37.738]  There was one thing you always did.
[01:14:37.818 --> 01:14:42.182]  You had to commit a suicide that was impossible, or die a death that was virtually impossible.
[01:14:42.722 --> 01:14:47.326]  But at the same time, who was the only person that benefited?
[01:14:48.386 --> 01:14:49.087]  He bought them.
[01:14:50.008 --> 01:14:51.549]  Now, look at this case.
[01:14:52.650 --> 01:14:58.374]  Who are the only people that benefit from Scalia dying at this opportune moment?
[01:14:59.095 --> 01:14:59.195]  Who?
[01:15:00.703 --> 01:15:03.427]  And I'm telling you, it's starting to look bad.
[01:15:03.447 --> 01:15:05.770]  It's starting to look bad for the home team.
[01:15:06.894 --> 01:15:08.315]  But we'll know more in the next episode.
[01:15:08.355 --> 01:15:19.979]  But we know now, of course you knew this forever because you were there running the governor's office, but Hillary gives orders directly to the entire press exactly how to write articles or they're kicked out.
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:28.503]  And so what I saw was the media instantly get in line with the story, not ask questions, not go down there and just shut up.
[01:15:28.963 --> 01:15:31.684]  It was clear the order was there to shut it down.
[01:15:32.044 --> 01:15:33.245]  It was like when Donald Trump came on.
[01:15:34.165 --> 01:15:38.634]  There were 2,500 and something articles in the first six hours.
[01:15:39.597 --> 01:15:41.919]  And then the next day, none.
[01:15:42.779 --> 01:15:43.740]  I mean, almost none.
[01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:49.884]  And that's because the order went down, shut up about that interview because they didn't want what was in that interview to be heard.
[01:15:49.944 --> 01:15:53.506]  Trump expected it to blow up, expected to be attacked for being on the show.
[01:15:53.526 --> 01:15:54.247]  That was his plan.
[01:15:54.787 --> 01:16:00.051]  They were sophisticated enough to drop it only after six hours, realizing it was a time bomb.
[01:16:00.711 --> 01:16:02.792]  And so, I mean, that's how sophisticated they are.
[01:16:02.832 --> 01:16:04.313]  So I see the media control
[01:16:05.254 --> 01:16:12.258]  In the first hours of this, and then the judge is saying we're not going to do an autopsy and all the rest of it, and then the pillow's on the face.
[01:16:12.538 --> 01:16:14.579]  Is that a message to everybody, though, that is awake?
[01:16:17.641 --> 01:16:19.402]  I think they're trying to let us know.
[01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:25.745]  I think they're trying to let someone know, Alex, and I'm afraid that someone may be Donald Trump.
[01:16:26.486 --> 01:16:32.229]  That someone may be the other judges on the court.
[01:16:32.549 --> 01:16:33.510]  Judges you talked to?
[01:16:34.731 --> 01:16:37.756]  Yes, that, you know, we can get to anybody.
[01:16:37.776 --> 01:16:40.260]  Wouldn't that be a hell of a message?
[01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:41.562]  We can get to anybody.
[01:16:41.922 --> 01:16:44.206]  You can't get any higher.
[01:16:46.069 --> 01:16:48.850]  Then Chief Justice Scalia, you just can't do it.
[01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:51.251]  I mean, there's obviously a war in the establishment.
[01:16:51.831 --> 01:16:52.051]  Right.
[01:16:52.211 --> 01:16:53.472]  There's a war in the establishment.
[01:16:53.792 --> 01:16:59.294]  You were on here two weeks ago, and you said, if they go after Hillary anymore, people are going to start dying.
[01:16:59.314 --> 01:17:00.074]  We ought to pull that up.
[01:17:00.534 --> 01:17:01.735]  The blackmail's going to begin.
[01:17:01.775 --> 01:17:03.295]  There's going to be a war, like a mafia war.
[01:17:03.315 --> 01:17:03.895]  That's what it is.
[01:17:04.135 --> 01:17:04.355]  Right.
[01:17:04.756 --> 01:17:08.477]  And so, who does really benefit from his mysterious death?
[01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:14.992]  Well, that's the key thing that I'm trying to, that's the thing I'm trying to figure out.
[01:17:15.452 --> 01:17:18.153]  And I'll tell you this, now guys, get ready.
[01:17:19.073 --> 01:17:23.935]  Every time the Clintons get near power, people are gonna die.
[01:17:24.835 --> 01:17:25.635]  People are gonna die.
[01:17:26.936 --> 01:17:30.457]  This is not the first, and this won't be the last.
[01:17:31.477 --> 01:17:33.658]  You know, it's Alex back here behind me, buddy.
[01:17:33.738 --> 01:17:35.519]  I got old Betsy, my
[01:17:36.371 --> 01:17:42.879]  Little 18 inch buoy that I keep with me even here at the house because I'm telling you, these people play rough.
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.362]  Am I saying Hillary ordered him dead?
[01:17:45.482 --> 01:17:45.642]  No.
[01:17:45.743 --> 01:17:47.545]  Am I saying somebody actually whacked him?
[01:17:47.965 --> 01:17:48.206]  No.
[01:17:49.407 --> 01:17:54.934]  But from everything I see, somebody's sending somebody a message.
[01:17:57.065 --> 01:18:01.408]  And I think it's a pretty vivid message that this is big league ball, Alex.
[01:18:01.448 --> 01:18:07.171]  Do you understand this is for the power of the most powerful nation in the world?
[01:18:07.392 --> 01:18:07.692]  I know.
[01:18:07.772 --> 01:18:10.934]  I mean, let me tell you, people envy the position I'm in.
[01:18:11.494 --> 01:18:12.315]  It is not fun.
[01:18:12.995 --> 01:18:16.476]  You know Alex, if you would tell me that a Chief Justice could die, Fox Scalia,
[01:18:42.455 --> 01:18:44.656]  In the, in just, just die.
[01:18:44.676 --> 01:18:46.397]  I mean, just purity old die.
[01:18:47.498 --> 01:18:51.680]  And the media would shut it down like they have.
[01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:53.001]  I would say you're crazy.
[01:18:53.341 --> 01:18:54.722]  But you see, here we go.
[01:18:55.542 --> 01:18:59.004]  Here we go with the Clintonistas all over again.
[01:18:59.884 --> 01:19:00.545]  I'm telling you.
[01:19:01.985 --> 01:19:06.428]  There's something connected to all of this and the message is being sent out.
[01:19:06.868 --> 01:19:08.349]  And I guarantee you this.
[01:19:09.281 --> 01:19:14.683]  The biggest decision we've got in this nation, as I said, is who's going to be our next president.
[01:19:14.703 --> 01:19:16.163]  Now, dear God, hope it's Trump.
[01:19:17.063 --> 01:19:18.004]  But he better be careful.
[01:19:18.704 --> 01:19:35.789]  And then the next decision is who goes on the Supreme Court, because the next Supreme Court justice that gets picked determines whether that court goes completely to the left or still has some semblance of going to the middle.
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:37.781]  We're going to get into that.
[01:19:38.342 --> 01:19:43.868]  It's so incredibly important, and I'm not doing this anymore today, but I'm skipping this network break because we have limited time with you, and this is just for the whole future of the country.
[01:19:44.829 --> 01:19:53.699]  Even WorldNetDaily has the article that the public is questioning the fact that John Poindexter had a special ops command background like you in Vietnam.
[01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:57.163]  That's who these people recruit is Army Green Berets.
[01:19:57.223 --> 01:19:58.024]  It's like the favorite.
[01:19:58.484 --> 01:19:58.824]  I don't know.
[01:20:22.409 --> 01:20:23.009]  Yeah, I mean it is.
[01:20:23.029 --> 01:20:23.889]  Again, let's hold our powder dry.
[01:20:51.161 --> 01:20:53.563]  I mean, you're dealing with the things that are.
[01:20:54.003 --> 01:20:55.384]  We don't have to make anything up.
[01:20:55.424 --> 01:20:58.026]  The things you're saying just are the things that are.
[01:20:58.706 --> 01:21:01.888]  Let's hold our powder dry until we know.
[01:21:02.969 --> 01:21:08.552]  Until we know for certain a few more things, Alex, and I'll know them by this afternoon or tomorrow.
[01:21:08.713 --> 01:21:10.894]  I promise you I'll know in the second.
[01:21:11.034 --> 01:21:12.235]  I know you know you'll know.
[01:21:13.143 --> 01:21:16.606]  But there are a lot of people, their butts are puckered like mine right now.
[01:21:16.766 --> 01:21:24.792]  And as a matter of fact, I'm gonna walk to my door because right out my door is a big black SUV that is pulled up.
[01:21:24.932 --> 01:21:30.576]  I'm gonna walk, make sure that they're not wanting inside this house for stuff.
[01:21:30.776 --> 01:21:31.517]  I'll be right back.
[01:21:31.557 --> 01:21:34.179]  I know, what you told me 20 minutes ago, I can't stand this.
[01:21:34.999 --> 01:21:37.141]  I can't stand hearing this stuff and not be able to talk about it.
[01:21:38.722 --> 01:21:39.263]  But, uh,
[01:21:40.407 --> 01:21:41.628]  This is the real world, folks.
[01:21:41.728 --> 01:21:42.529]  This is the real world.
[01:21:42.869 --> 01:21:45.732]  There's no one else that we know of sending reporters out there.
[01:21:46.753 --> 01:21:49.595]  They're all just repeating whatever the national media says.
[01:21:49.895 --> 01:21:57.662]  We've got a team of five people, two different teams, on the ground in El Paso and also out in Alpine and out at that ranch.
[01:21:57.962 --> 01:21:58.583]  And they're coming up.
[01:22:00.324 --> 01:22:01.365]  And this is real media.
[01:22:02.166 --> 01:22:03.087]  This is what it's all about.
[01:22:04.548 --> 01:22:10.853]  Police detectives all over the country, prominent ones that head and hold divisions, are saying there's a cover-up going on.
[01:22:11.093 --> 01:22:12.474]  We're not seeing anybody did anything.
[01:22:12.914 --> 01:22:13.194]  Go ahead.
[01:22:13.875 --> 01:22:14.735]  Go figure that out.
[01:22:14.876 --> 01:22:21.120]  I go out, there's a black SUV, pulls in my driveway, sits there, two guys in it.
[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:26.444]  I go to the door, I step out the door, they back up.
[01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:33.254]  I moved back towards the door, they pulled back in, then I walked back out and they back up and I tailed it out.
[01:22:33.414 --> 01:22:34.935]  And we've been to your house.
[01:22:35.115 --> 01:22:35.936]  We've been to your house.
[01:22:36.056 --> 01:22:37.437]  I mean, it's a rural area.
[01:22:38.357 --> 01:22:38.898]  That's right.
[01:22:39.518 --> 01:22:41.499]  So, you know, was it something?
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:42.560]  Alex, I don't know.
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:45.402]  Well, buddy, I know you got more than Bowie knives.
[01:22:46.223 --> 01:22:47.764]  I know you got more Bowie knives there.
[01:22:49.976 --> 01:22:52.857]  If I have to, but... That's just like Jim Bowie.
[01:22:52.877 --> 01:22:54.438]  He was sick on his back at the Alamo.
[01:22:54.478 --> 01:22:57.939]  Probably killed 20 people himself, so... He was laid back, you know, right there.
[01:22:58.639 --> 01:23:02.181]  Look... I don't know what's going on.
[01:23:03.241 --> 01:23:03.941]  Alex, I don't.
[01:23:05.882 --> 01:23:08.103]  You and I have been a part of it before.
[01:23:09.604 --> 01:23:10.364]  And it's coming again.
[01:23:10.384 --> 01:23:12.865]  I don't want to see it come again, but it's coming again.
[01:23:13.045 --> 01:23:13.845]  I have a sick feeling.
[01:23:13.905 --> 01:23:15.266]  I have a sick feeling.
[01:23:16.286 --> 01:23:18.307]  You know, and I don't know what more I can do.
[01:23:19.142 --> 01:23:21.563]  And let's be clear, let's be clear.
[01:23:49.568 --> 01:23:52.330]  The stuff you told me over the years continues to come out to be accurate.
[01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:56.812]  I haven't been given any info yet that no one else knows, because I don't want the SUV coming.
[01:23:57.333 --> 01:24:01.335]  And it's not that I'm even scared of that in a way, but I'm not going to get killed because they're so scared of the info I got.
[01:24:01.676 --> 01:24:04.337]  Until I get info, then I'll get the info out, and then they can do whatever they want.
[01:24:04.357 --> 01:24:08.140]  I want to make sure the mission's complete, you know, here before something like that happens.
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:15.084]  But, I mean, specifically though, we know Supreme Court justices are scared.
[01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:20.492]  I can promise you that from when I've talked to guests.
[01:24:21.233 --> 01:24:25.576]  But I will tell you this, you know, Alex, just think about you.
[01:24:26.376 --> 01:24:31.600]  I think about me all the time just because of who I am and who I'm in the way of getting what she wants.
[01:24:32.261 --> 01:24:33.422]  Just think about you now.
[01:24:34.222 --> 01:24:43.549]  Think about the fact that you might, because of your program, because of the strength of your audience, think about how you're in between
[01:24:45.245 --> 01:24:45.645]  Something.
[01:24:45.926 --> 01:24:46.786]  Don't know what it is.
[01:24:47.887 --> 01:24:48.808]  But you're in the way now.
[01:24:50.349 --> 01:24:52.590]  That's right, because the media knows it's mafia.
[01:24:52.971 --> 01:24:53.751]  The media knows.
[01:24:54.131 --> 01:24:55.052]  They follow orders.
[01:24:55.072 --> 01:24:56.493]  The entire media to just shut up.
[01:24:57.614 --> 01:24:59.195]  What a nation of cowards.
[01:24:59.515 --> 01:25:00.336]  I just can't believe it.
[01:25:01.277 --> 01:25:09.483]  And so now you're sitting here, you and a handful of other conservative, reasonably conservative, I'm not talking about you, but others.
[01:25:10.904 --> 01:25:14.006]  And you're in the way of something big.
[01:25:14.693 --> 01:25:15.973]  You're in the way of something.
[01:25:16.033 --> 01:25:16.273]  I know.
[01:25:16.334 --> 01:25:17.134]  Awfully, awfully big.
[01:25:17.154 --> 01:25:18.234]  Well, I can feel the danger.
[01:25:18.254 --> 01:25:18.694]  Let me tell you.
[01:25:18.994 --> 01:25:24.776]  Saturday morning, and I've only done this like four other times, I called up Dew and my key managers and I said, get to the office now.
[01:25:25.036 --> 01:25:26.096]  Hell's about to break loose.
[01:25:26.136 --> 01:25:30.278]  And we were all here for seven hours, and the last two had already broken.
[01:25:30.318 --> 01:25:32.078]  We didn't even know because I was in my conference room.
[01:25:33.178 --> 01:25:35.419]  And I was actually live streaming saying something big's about to happen.
[01:25:35.439 --> 01:25:36.579]  I didn't even know this had happened yet.
[01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:37.980]  Is the SUV back?
[01:25:40.501 --> 01:25:41.581]  Yeah, it's alright.
[01:25:42.938 --> 01:25:43.679]  Let them sit there.
[01:25:43.699 --> 01:25:48.501]  I mean, as long as they're sitting there, and I'm sitting here, I'm not that worried.
[01:25:49.362 --> 01:25:50.562]  Can you turn your computer?
[01:25:50.702 --> 01:25:52.103]  Maybe take it over to the door?
[01:25:52.223 --> 01:25:52.623]  I can't.
[01:25:52.703 --> 01:25:53.244]  I tried.
[01:25:53.344 --> 01:25:53.804]  I can't.
[01:25:53.944 --> 01:25:55.104]  I was going to, but I can't.
[01:25:55.805 --> 01:26:02.188]  Let me, uh... Well, now, see, they're backing up, so I think they're listening to us, Alec.
[01:26:02.728 --> 01:26:03.949]  Can you say hello to them?
[01:26:03.989 --> 01:26:06.990]  Say hi to whoever these two bozos are?
[01:26:07.691 --> 01:26:11.813]  Look, it may be... Well, that's real, so you tell me who it is.
[01:26:13.257 --> 01:26:19.262]  Tell me what it is I just found out an hour, hour and a half ago that makes people be in my yard this quick.
[01:26:21.243 --> 01:26:21.563]  Tell me.
[01:26:23.085 --> 01:26:25.847]  Well, you told us, and I just wish you'd tell everybody else right now.
[01:26:25.867 --> 01:26:28.309]  I mean... I would if I could.
[01:26:28.329 --> 01:26:29.269]  I just can't.
[01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:31.191]  I just can't because of who it was.
[01:26:31.351 --> 01:26:32.392]  No, I get it, but now we know.
[01:26:32.452 --> 01:26:33.913]  In case they kill you right now, I get it.
[01:26:34.673 --> 01:26:38.156]  Yeah, and... It's big.
[01:26:38.176 --> 01:26:40.418]  That's all I can tell you, folks.
[01:26:40.518 --> 01:26:41.158]  It's big.
[01:26:41.298 --> 01:26:41.799]  I mean...
[01:26:45.637 --> 01:26:54.679]  They didn't even bother to cover this up in any reasonable manner.
[01:26:55.039 --> 01:26:56.680]  I mean, don't you see that, folks?
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:59.820]  They didn't even bother to hide it.
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:02.601]  I mean, this is in your face, Alex.
[01:27:02.901 --> 01:27:03.881]  This is in your face.
[01:27:03.921 --> 01:27:07.342]  This is saying, it's like counting with John F. Kennedy, you know?
[01:27:08.027 --> 01:27:15.192]  If we can kill the President of the United States right in front of the American people and everybody can see it and nobody can do anything about it, get real.
[01:27:16.073 --> 01:27:16.453]  Get real.
[01:27:17.013 --> 01:27:18.935]  And then they killed hundreds of people to cover that up.
[01:27:19.755 --> 01:27:21.537]  And this gets about as real as it gets.
[01:27:22.117 --> 01:27:23.718]  Just about as real as it gets.
[01:27:23.978 --> 01:27:27.601]  Now, maybe, maybe we're going to find out.
[01:27:27.621 --> 01:27:33.185]  The rest of the day we're going to find out somebody just died of old age.
[01:27:33.285 --> 01:27:33.725]  I doubt it.
[01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:35.266]  I doubt it now.
[01:27:38.473 --> 01:27:42.518]  I doubt they're here to wish me a belated Happy Valentine's Day.
[01:27:42.538 --> 01:27:49.146]  And I'm sure they're interested in who I've been talking to.
[01:27:50.067 --> 01:27:53.071]  And I... It's just gonna have to be.
[01:27:53.331 --> 01:27:54.693]  It's just gonna have to be that way, Alec.
[01:27:57.065 --> 01:28:02.149]  Well, Larry Nichols, Larry Nichols, big Clinton whistleblower is on with us right now.
[01:28:02.589 --> 01:28:04.410]  And I don't need to believe what he's telling me.
[01:28:04.851 --> 01:28:07.973]  My spider sense is off the charts right now.
[01:28:08.753 --> 01:28:10.555]  I mean, it's in a fight mode right now.
[01:28:10.935 --> 01:28:14.878]  I mean, I'm just like, I mean, I feel like I could take on 10 guys right now, folks.
[01:28:15.218 --> 01:28:21.903]  And that's because my gut, my physiology, my brain, my overall, all these, everything happening just tells me I'm in a total war.
[01:28:22.563 --> 01:28:24.605]  And by the way, folks, so are you.
[01:28:25.686 --> 01:28:28.146]  And it's big, it's for the whole future of this country and the world.
[01:28:30.367 --> 01:28:35.208]  The election, what do you think of Trump and the things he's been up to?
[01:28:37.208 --> 01:28:42.809]  Look, Donald Trump, I'm afraid, is starting to succumb to the trickery of the RNC.
[01:28:44.829 --> 01:28:51.951]  You know, when he started yesterday kind of waving up that contract saying that, you know, the Republicans are violating their agreement, you know, to treat him fairly.
[01:28:54.065 --> 01:29:01.388]  Donald Trump, if he is listening, if he will stay in the Republican Party, he'll win that primary, Alex.
[01:29:01.468 --> 01:29:02.368]  Because of the landslide.
[01:29:02.388 --> 01:29:03.509]  They can't fill the landslide.
[01:29:04.589 --> 01:29:05.429]  They can't stop it.
[01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:12.312]  Now, if he breaks out and runs as an independent because he's mad, he can't win.
[01:29:13.152 --> 01:29:13.933]  And Hillary does.
[01:29:14.613 --> 01:29:15.213]  Hillary does.
[01:29:16.054 --> 01:29:19.495]  So I say to Donald Trump, listen to me, please.
[01:29:22.182 --> 01:29:24.425]  Stay in the Republican Party.
[01:29:24.525 --> 01:29:25.105]  They're mad.
[01:29:25.165 --> 01:29:26.066]  They're upset.
[01:29:26.166 --> 01:29:27.408]  You got them stumped.
[01:29:27.548 --> 01:29:36.978]  You know, they just knew Alex because of what he said about 9-11 and such that he was just going to be committing murder, committing suicide, I'm sorry, in that debate.
[01:29:37.018 --> 01:29:37.538]  Well, guess what?
[01:29:37.599 --> 01:29:38.860]  His numbers didn't go down.
[01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:39.521]  They went up.
[01:29:40.261 --> 01:29:40.722]  They went up.
[01:29:41.843 --> 01:29:43.044]  Trump will stay in.
[01:29:43.544 --> 01:29:45.965]  He will win the Republican primary.
[01:29:46.125 --> 01:29:46.485]  Stay there.
[01:29:46.525 --> 01:29:47.526]  Do five more minutes with us.
[01:29:48.146 --> 01:29:50.167]  And again, Larry Nichols is our guest.
[01:29:50.207 --> 01:29:52.168]  He's been on my show for 20 years.
[01:29:52.668 --> 01:29:56.290]  And he's never said a black SUV's parked out his farmhouse right now.
[01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:57.570]  And when he goes out, it backs out.
[01:29:57.891 --> 01:29:58.791]  We're on the march.
[01:29:59.291 --> 01:30:00.452]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:00.552 --> 01:30:03.773]  For Kathleen Willey, I add on Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.099 --> 01:30:23.098]  Russian warplanes are being blamed for carrying out what is being described as a deliberate attack on two makeshift hospitals and a school in northern Syria Monday that killed nearly 50 people, according to the United Nations, reports Fox News.
[01:30:23.999 --> 01:30:30.345]  Doctors Without Borders said that the hospital was hit four times in at least two attacks that were minutes apart.
[01:30:30.925 --> 01:30:36.030]  A third air raid hit a school in a nearby village, killing seven and wounding others.
[01:30:36.350 --> 01:30:45.378]  The Russian Prime Minister issued a blanket denial over the weekend that Moscow was targeting civilians in civilian facilities in Syria, reports The Guardian.
[01:30:45.698 --> 01:30:45.918]  U.S.
[01:30:45.958 --> 01:30:53.066]  Military Colonel Steve Warren on Twitter said the destruction of the Doctors Without Borders hospital was quote, terrible news.
[01:30:53.406 --> 01:30:54.728]  But last year, the U.S.
[01:30:54.788 --> 01:30:59.152]  itself hit a Doctors Without Borders facility in Afghanistan, killing 30 people.
[01:30:59.453 --> 01:31:01.815]  It was chalked up to a quote, human error.
[01:31:02.376 --> 01:31:05.940]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[01:31:09.768 --> 01:31:13.169]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:31:13.530 --> 01:31:20.652]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:31:21.272 --> 01:31:29.575]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:31:29.595 --> 01:31:33.977]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:31:34.297 --> 01:31:36.478]  Pathenogens added to the food and water,
[01:31:36.738 --> 01:31:43.723]  To the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:31:44.124 --> 01:31:47.246]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[01:31:47.546 --> 01:31:58.595]  AnthroPlex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:31:58.695 --> 01:32:01.336]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.
[01:32:01.556 --> 01:32:07.639]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:32:08.079 --> 01:32:12.440]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male, and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[01:32:12.741 --> 01:32:17.362]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:32:17.482 --> 01:32:18.483]  Talk about the effects.
[01:32:18.823 --> 01:32:20.305]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:32:20.325 --> 01:32:21.948]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:32:22.248 --> 01:32:23.330]  I feel like I look better.
[01:32:23.370 --> 01:32:24.031]  I feel better.
[01:32:24.091 --> 01:32:25.112]  I feel sexier.
[01:32:25.132 --> 01:32:25.854]  I love it.
[01:32:26.114 --> 01:32:29.018]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[01:32:29.098 --> 01:32:31.822]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[01:32:32.023 --> 01:32:33.064]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:32:33.124 --> 01:32:34.106]  Consult your physician.
[01:32:34.286 --> 01:32:36.487]  Visit Infowarslife.com today.
[01:32:36.647 --> 01:32:37.587]  This is life-changing.
[01:32:37.967 --> 01:32:38.727]  Shower filters.
[01:32:38.867 --> 01:32:40.467]  We're introducing the best yet.
[01:32:40.488 --> 01:32:44.528]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[01:32:44.669 --> 01:32:49.290]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[01:32:49.490 --> 01:32:56.411]  This new four-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.

[01:32:59.292 --> 01:33:00.094]  We're good to go.
[01:33:21.681 --> 01:33:29.163]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[01:33:30.163 --> 01:33:34.084]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:34.544 --> 01:33:38.344]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:33:38.704 --> 01:33:40.245]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:40.785 --> 01:33:46.326]  Take the children and yourself and hide out in the cellar.
[01:33:47.486 --> 01:33:50.947]  Right now the fighting will be close at hand.
[01:33:53.001 --> 01:33:54.423]  This is the takeover of the Republic.
[01:33:55.525 --> 01:34:00.393]  Once they have full control, they'll start the persecution of the general public.
[01:34:06.730 --> 01:34:07.611]  Larry Nichols is with us.
[01:34:07.631 --> 01:34:08.332]  We're holding him over.
[01:34:08.372 --> 01:34:15.659]  He did, on his cell phone, get a photo of the black SUV at his rural home that is backing into his drive.
[01:34:15.779 --> 01:34:18.902]  And then he's up there on a hill pulling out when he comes back out.
[01:34:19.362 --> 01:34:20.483]  But he was able to get a photo.
[01:34:20.503 --> 01:34:22.845]  And your Skype's pretty clear, Larry.
[01:34:22.885 --> 01:34:31.654]  Try to hold the photo part, the screen, up as close as you can in front of your face and then forward towards the camera.
[01:34:32.507 --> 01:34:33.988]  I'm trying to find it again.
[01:34:34.008 --> 01:34:36.449]  I held it on the... No, no.
[01:34:36.469 --> 01:34:38.850]  Nico, you just showed Nico and I. We just saw it.
[01:34:38.910 --> 01:34:43.072]  I know, but I... Somehow... I know you're not super technical.
[01:34:43.092 --> 01:34:43.973]  Believe me, I'm not either.
[01:34:44.013 --> 01:34:44.893]  Yeah, believe me.
[01:34:45.033 --> 01:34:46.674]  I don't know what I've done with it.
[01:34:46.694 --> 01:34:48.315]  I was holding it up and showing you.
[01:34:49.876 --> 01:34:50.176]  Shit.
[01:34:51.337 --> 01:34:51.837]  Delete that.
[01:34:53.057 --> 01:34:53.938]  I didn't mean to say that.
[01:34:53.958 --> 01:34:54.318]  I'm sorry.
[01:34:54.338 --> 01:34:57.220]  I don't blame you when you've got a black sedan that pulls in and out of your driveway.
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:58.660]  But we just saw the photo in there.
[01:34:59.221 --> 01:34:59.801]  Take your time.
[01:35:00.741 --> 01:35:00.941]  Well...
[01:35:03.894 --> 01:35:04.834]  I know I've got it.
[01:35:04.854 --> 01:35:05.814]  Hold your phone up for a second.
[01:35:05.854 --> 01:35:07.955]  I was, I was showing it.
[01:35:07.975 --> 01:35:08.835]  No, no, we just saw it, I know.
[01:35:09.395 --> 01:35:12.656]  No, no, the camera's in... Hold it up with the camera.
[01:35:13.136 --> 01:35:13.616]  Turn it around.
[01:35:13.736 --> 01:35:19.877]  See, yeah, that's what I'm trying to do, but it doesn't show up on my pictures, pictures.
[01:35:19.917 --> 01:35:20.477]  No, I understand.
[01:35:20.497 --> 01:35:22.258]  That's a, that's a, you need to get a better cell phone.
[01:35:22.278 --> 01:35:24.038]  We're going to send you a fancy one, buddy.
[01:35:24.058 --> 01:35:25.158]  You need one to protect yourself.
[01:35:25.699 --> 01:35:27.279]  But anyway, it's out there.
[01:35:27.319 --> 01:35:30.980]  They saw a picture of it when I was, when I had it.
[01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:32.100]  Is the SUV still there?
[01:35:33.257 --> 01:35:35.658]  Okay, get up, get up.
[01:35:35.678 --> 01:35:37.478]  They backed up and they moved further down.
[01:35:37.558 --> 01:35:39.118]  I'm going to take another picture if you can hold.
[01:35:39.478 --> 01:35:40.219]  Hold one second.
[01:35:40.579 --> 01:35:41.179]  Yeah, you know what?
[01:35:41.239 --> 01:35:41.819]  Go out there.
[01:35:41.839 --> 01:35:42.739]  We're going to stay with you.
[01:35:43.359 --> 01:35:44.399]  Just walk out, take the picture.
[01:35:44.419 --> 01:35:44.719]  Go ahead.
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:45.880]  All right.
[01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:46.860]  I know they'll try to drive off.
[01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:49.480]  Believe me, I've known this guy for 20 years, folks.
[01:35:49.581 --> 01:35:50.441]  He's not BSing us.
[01:35:50.621 --> 01:35:51.421]  I just saw it in there.
[01:35:54.422 --> 01:35:55.982]  It's like those little cheapo phones.
[01:35:57.362 --> 01:36:00.283]  Nichols is such a classic guy, such a piece of work, folks.
[01:36:02.998 --> 01:36:07.908]  He doesn't, obviously, because he doesn't want them to kill him, and then it looked like it was the cancers.
[01:36:07.969 --> 01:36:12.117]  He doesn't want folks knowing that, but they know, and so the point is, is that
[01:36:13.564 --> 01:36:22.410]  He's done the non-resuscitate forms now and everything, and he's got a tracheotomy right now in his neck if you're a radio listener.
[01:36:23.131 --> 01:36:26.894]  And he's a tough old bird, but he is fighting for his life right now, so pray for him.
[01:36:27.374 --> 01:36:30.796]  By the way, they've tried to bankrupt and destroy him, that's why he's got a $20 cell phone.
[01:36:31.417 --> 01:36:33.338]  NicholsLive at AOL.com.
[01:36:34.399 --> 01:36:36.360]  You want to make a donation to him so you can get a better camera?
[01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:37.141]  Look, there's the photo.
[01:36:37.161 --> 01:36:38.022]  Yeah, we saw it earlier.
[01:36:38.062 --> 01:36:38.902]  Just back it out a little bit.
[01:36:39.182 --> 01:36:39.723]  Back it out a little bit.
[01:36:40.814 --> 01:36:44.796]  Yep, there you can see the SUV right there that's backed out more.
[01:36:44.836 --> 01:36:45.856]  The other one was closer up.
[01:36:45.897 --> 01:36:48.558]  Now they've backed out and are out on the street.
[01:36:48.578 --> 01:36:53.700]  They backed up and then when I came out to take this picture, a guy jumped in the SUV.
[01:36:56.642 --> 01:36:57.302]  Right there.
[01:36:57.462 --> 01:36:58.423]  Man, I wish I was there.
[01:36:58.983 --> 01:37:00.043]  Oh, I wish I was there right now.
[01:37:00.063 --> 01:37:02.605]  Do you have any family that's home right now?
[01:37:03.585 --> 01:37:04.646]  No, just me.
[01:37:04.966 --> 01:37:05.406]  Me and you.
[01:37:05.426 --> 01:37:06.987]  Me and you and the dogs.
[01:37:08.041 --> 01:37:10.142]  And your bulldog, and the millions watching and listening.
[01:37:10.642 --> 01:37:11.242]  Man, I tell ya.
[01:37:11.462 --> 01:37:15.083]  Well, let's put us a dress out for folks that are in Arkansas right now, folks.
[01:37:15.863 --> 01:37:16.824]  He gives us a dress out.
[01:37:18.084 --> 01:37:25.126]  58 Kingsington Drive, 58 Kingsington Drive, Conway, Arkansas, 72034, folks.
[01:37:25.947 --> 01:37:28.848]  58 Kingsington Drive, Conway, Arkansas, 72034.
[01:37:30.128 --> 01:37:32.369]  We got truckers, or page-rich in the area.
[01:37:32.849 --> 01:37:36.390]  You pull that map up and you get over there right now, folks, because these guys are definitely messing with him.
[01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:50.504]  You know, Alex, this one I'm talking about, y'all, unless you've gone through this, you know, unless you go through this, folks, now, you know, number one, hell, what are they gonna do to me?
[01:37:50.744 --> 01:37:53.504]  I mean, you gonna do any more to me than I've already got done to me?
[01:37:53.985 --> 01:37:54.205]  No.
[01:37:55.025 --> 01:38:03.787]  But it's just the intimidation factor trying to shut me up, and it ain't never worked, and they're gonna one day learn to quit this crap.
[01:38:03.807 --> 01:38:05.608]  They're gonna one day learn.
[01:38:06.564 --> 01:38:08.945]  Because I guarantee you, I'll take the damn picture.
[01:38:09.065 --> 01:38:11.185]  I'll meet him anytime out in the lot.
[01:38:11.606 --> 01:38:13.246]  Sick as I am, I'll meet him.
[01:38:14.166 --> 01:38:15.127]  You know I will, Alex.
[01:38:15.147 --> 01:38:16.007]  Hell, I don't stutter.
[01:38:16.027 --> 01:38:20.668]  Well, they think we're cowards like they are.
[01:38:22.409 --> 01:38:22.849]  Who is it?
[01:38:23.009 --> 01:38:24.089]  What is this all about?
[01:38:24.109 --> 01:38:29.411]  You know, here again, they're sending a message to somebody.
[01:38:29.431 --> 01:38:31.692]  Who knows, Alex?
[01:38:31.712 --> 01:38:32.252]  Maybe it's you.
[01:38:32.272 --> 01:38:34.933]  Have you looked outside your building?
[01:38:35.948 --> 01:38:37.109]  Oh, we're not really worried about it.
[01:38:37.129 --> 01:38:38.670]  Okay.
[01:38:38.730 --> 01:38:42.272]  You know, we're just doing our duty here.
[01:38:42.493 --> 01:38:43.193]  That's why I'm not afraid.
[01:38:43.213 --> 01:38:43.573]  I know.
[01:38:44.194 --> 01:38:46.095]  I mean, I'm so sick of having to fight these people.
[01:38:46.115 --> 01:38:47.736]  I mean, I have a duty.
[01:38:47.756 --> 01:38:49.017]  I don't want to die.
[01:38:49.037 --> 01:38:50.478]  And I want to be here for my children.
[01:38:50.538 --> 01:38:56.682]  But the final equation, play your hand like, you know, like John Wayne says in True Grit.
[01:38:58.784 --> 01:38:59.684]  He says, fill your hand.
[01:39:06.363 --> 01:39:07.344]  I don't know what to say.
[01:39:07.364 --> 01:39:08.926]  This is not our country anymore.
[01:39:08.966 --> 01:39:10.067]  It's not the country we know.
[01:39:10.087 --> 01:39:10.948]  It's not.
[01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:17.755]  And I guess that's why we've got to fight, folks.
[01:39:17.936 --> 01:39:20.198]  This is not the country we were brought up in.
[01:39:21.299 --> 01:39:28.267]  This is not the kind of stuff you're supposed to have happen simply by speaking the truth, simply by
[01:39:29.111 --> 01:39:30.532]  Simply by putting out the truth.
[01:39:30.612 --> 01:39:33.874]  I don't know that anybody on this program, Alex, I certainly haven't.
[01:39:33.914 --> 01:39:35.575]  I know you haven't since I've been here.
[01:39:35.615 --> 01:39:39.097]  Nobody's put anything out that's detrimental to anybody's
[01:39:40.058 --> 01:39:42.379]  Investigation or causing any problems?
[01:39:42.399 --> 01:39:44.599]  Hell, as far as I know, there is no investigation.
[01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:45.940]  No, there is no investigation.
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:49.961]  We were told when it was announced that he was dead, there'd be no investigation.
[01:39:50.181 --> 01:39:51.402]  The most suspicious thing ever.
[01:39:51.922 --> 01:39:53.982]  And then they said, by the way, there was a pillow on his head.
[01:39:54.002 --> 01:40:00.024]  I mean, just to mess with us so that those of us in the know would freak out and then the general public would just believe it.
[01:40:00.804 --> 01:40:04.946]  Well, just stay focused, folks, please.
[01:40:05.366 --> 01:40:08.887]  Remember, don't let this be a distraction.
[01:40:10.236 --> 01:40:10.456]  No.
[01:40:11.117 --> 01:40:16.624]  Don't let them distract us from the mission at hand.
[01:40:17.105 --> 01:40:22.111]  I'm telling you, this election will be the last presidential election we'll get to be a part of, Alex.
[01:40:22.832 --> 01:40:23.212]  It is.
[01:40:23.773 --> 01:40:24.294]  I'm sorry.
[01:40:24.414 --> 01:40:24.754]  It is.
[01:40:25.415 --> 01:40:26.937]  And I want to tell you something, folks.
[01:40:27.698 --> 01:40:29.400]  We've never had more power.
[01:40:30.051 --> 01:40:36.355]  Then we have right now, because every one of the politicians that are running for office, remember a third of the Senate's having to run.
[01:40:36.836 --> 01:40:41.959]  Every member of Congress is having to run, and they know this country's about to come down.
[01:40:42.159 --> 01:40:45.722]  They know it's about to come down, and they want to be there.
[01:40:45.922 --> 01:40:56.930]  Alex, when this country falls, they want to be a part of the centrist government that's left over, and they know if they're defeated, this election
[01:40:57.972 --> 01:40:59.333]  They're out forever.
[01:40:59.933 --> 01:41:00.433]  Forever.
[01:41:00.873 --> 01:41:05.075]  And then they can be prosecuted, so they're cornered rats.
[01:41:05.616 --> 01:41:06.116]  That's right.
[01:41:07.576 --> 01:41:10.618]  And that's another thing that you have to realize about Hillary.
[01:41:11.638 --> 01:41:13.679]  Hillary is a cornered rat.
[01:41:14.099 --> 01:41:23.804]  Now, maybe not from the email scandal that everybody thinks is so bad, but Alex, she's a cornered rat with the stuff I have.
[01:41:24.602 --> 01:41:34.924]  Well, I'll tell you, those Navy SEALs up there, the survivors of Benghazi, you'd say they were all on the sat phone getting orders directly from the State Department that they'd been ordered to stand down.
[01:41:34.944 --> 01:41:43.867]  They were security for the State Department, and they got direct orders to stand down from their bosses, and then Hillary's a big fat liar, you know, saying that she didn't do that.
[01:41:43.887 --> 01:41:44.987]  It was obviously a stand down.
[01:41:45.807 --> 01:41:48.068]  Yeah, well, I promise you this.
[01:41:49.928 --> 01:41:53.369]  It's win or lose for Hillary, and when I say win or lose,
[01:41:54.888 --> 01:41:57.029]  You understand, Alex, it's win or lose for her.
[01:41:57.369 --> 01:42:09.515]  Either she gets to be what she's wanted to be since she was four years old, the first female president of the United States of America, and then the most powerful couple in the history of the world.
[01:42:09.735 --> 01:42:12.937]  Either they get that or she goes to jail.
[01:42:14.137 --> 01:42:14.858]  It's not a joke.
[01:42:15.258 --> 01:42:15.938]  It's not a game.
[01:42:17.779 --> 01:42:23.322]  And I think if you look at some of the decisions being looked at by the Supreme Court,
[01:42:24.605 --> 01:42:28.807]  I think you see who benefits by Scalia dying.
[01:42:29.827 --> 01:42:31.448]  And I think that's where you need to start.
[01:42:31.508 --> 01:42:44.593]  Start looking at what decisions, and remember this Alex, in 1970 I believe it was, Congress passed a law saying no president in his last year of office can appoint an interim
[01:42:46.776 --> 01:42:53.762]  Uh, Supreme Court Justice, unless one thing exists, and that's a crisis in the court.
[01:42:53.982 --> 01:42:55.203]  And that's the nuclear option.
[01:42:55.964 --> 01:42:57.565]  And since we're at a 4-4 tie...
[01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:01.481]  Therefore the court can't really go forward.
[01:43:01.601 --> 01:43:04.942]  Notice he was the key guy, the key guy at the key time.
[01:43:05.282 --> 01:43:10.044]  And Obama says he's going to operate under emergency rule with open borders, everything else.
[01:43:10.184 --> 01:43:16.227]  I mean, this is... And then one of his top donors, he gives personal awards made up just for him.
[01:43:16.247 --> 01:43:18.368]  Oh my gosh.
[01:43:18.428 --> 01:43:20.329]  I mean, they really think we're stupid.
[01:43:20.949 --> 01:43:23.290]  And then there's something that people don't know about.
[01:43:24.133 --> 01:43:26.634]  Alex, I didn't know about this until this weekend.
[01:43:26.654 --> 01:43:31.915]  Did y'all know that since 2012, Obama signed a presidential special order?
[01:43:33.095 --> 01:43:51.118]  And a hundred miles on either side of our border to the north, to Canada, a hundred miles either side south to Mexico, east to the Atlantic Ocean, west to the Pacific, a hundred miles inland, is considered or called what's called a no-constitution zone.
[01:43:51.258 --> 01:43:51.799]  That's official!
[01:43:51.819 --> 01:43:53.439]  They actually call it, absolutely.
[01:43:54.375 --> 01:44:03.643]  And guys, that means if you live within 100 miles of the border of Mexico, Canada, the Pacific Ocean, or the Atlantic Ocean, you don't have a constitution to protect you.
[01:44:04.804 --> 01:44:05.565]  It was done away with.
[01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:10.901]  Well, I mean, look at the NDAA, look at how they're trying to give Obama martial law powers in Congress.
[01:44:10.921 --> 01:44:13.382]  The Republicans, they are really positioning it.
[01:44:13.422 --> 01:44:14.762]  Now they're trying to start a war with Russia.
[01:44:15.402 --> 01:44:19.983]  Larry Nichols, I want you to stay, keep your Skype on.
[01:44:20.083 --> 01:44:22.023]  We're going to go to Richard Reeves here in just a moment.
[01:44:22.784 --> 01:44:26.284]  We're putting that Constitution Free Zone up on the screen for TV viewers from ACLU.
[01:44:27.345 --> 01:44:28.125]  This is not a joke.
[01:44:29.119 --> 01:44:31.780]  One hundred miles zone, and now they're just practicing it there.
[01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:37.721]  Most of the population lives within, you know, a hundred miles of the border or the Atlantic or the Pacific.
[01:44:38.721 --> 01:44:41.061]  Truly unprecedented, my friend, but God bless you.
[01:44:41.081 --> 01:44:43.682]  We're going to talk to you again tomorrow, obviously, or tonight.
[01:44:44.242 --> 01:44:49.983]  We do not want to wait any on the news that you gave us.
[01:44:50.083 --> 01:44:51.563]  And again, you didn't give me the details.
[01:44:54.444 --> 01:45:01.849]  But I think it's safe to, isn't it safe to tell folks at least what you told Nico and I so that, so at least that's out or you can't even tell us?
[01:45:03.330 --> 01:45:12.196]  Just know that years ago, and Alex you remember this, I worked very closely with a Supreme Court Justice that happened to be in a bind getting confirmed.
[01:45:13.657 --> 01:45:15.639]  And because of that I have a relationship.
[01:45:16.479 --> 01:45:23.284]  Now it's a personal relationship, it's not an official, but it does create a bit of a problem legally.
[01:45:24.005 --> 01:45:36.001]  But just know this, that I'm not making stuff up, and I have no power to get data or get information, but a certain person does, and I don't have it.
[01:45:37.389 --> 01:45:38.110]  That I assure you.
[01:46:07.849 --> 01:46:16.376]  We didn't have all the people in government convinced like we do now, and there's so many good people, just like you were, Green Beret, in the system, but you wouldn't kill kids.
[01:46:16.737 --> 01:46:34.131]  That was your, like, Tony Montana, you said, that's it, I'm not killing little kids, I'm not killing, you know, I'm gonna expose you, you know, that's a whole other show with you, and it was all proven what you said, it all came out, the drug dealing, you know, all of it, because, you know, you said, you hit your knees, you cried, you said, Christ, I, you know, can't, you know, you know, be part of this, you hit rock bottom.
[01:46:34.531 --> 01:46:38.675]  And you know, just like you're on the cross beside Christ, you said tonight we'll be in paradise, my brother.
[01:46:38.975 --> 01:46:42.058]  And that's why these guys have to worry that they're cowards and serve the system.
[01:46:42.338 --> 01:46:46.141]  But more and more, I don't know special ops people that aren't awake.
[01:46:46.401 --> 01:46:52.567]  A lot of the feds are evil or they're leftist and they get off on it and they hate the patriot movement and they're into power.
[01:46:52.587 --> 01:46:56.971]  Because they have been able to find the mentally ill military folks to kind of fill their ranks.
[01:46:57.011 --> 01:46:59.113]  But that's a very small group of trash.
[01:47:00.133 --> 01:47:01.995]  And not even all the feds are like that either.
[01:47:02.335 --> 01:47:04.237]  So they've got to be looking over their shoulder.
[01:47:04.297 --> 01:47:05.658]  And we're not afraid to die.
[01:47:05.718 --> 01:47:07.019]  That's the difference between us.
[01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:13.604]  And I know I'm not speaking for you, but I mean, I just know that's how you feel, Larry, because you couldn't do what you do if you were a coward.
[01:47:15.246 --> 01:47:20.210]  I'm probably a coward, but... You're not a coward?
[01:47:20.250 --> 01:47:20.970]  That's ridiculous.
[01:47:21.130 --> 01:47:21.811]  Why would you say that?
[01:47:22.651 --> 01:47:24.813]  You just... There's nowhere to run.
[01:47:24.833 --> 01:47:25.694]  There's nowhere to hide.
[01:47:27.045 --> 01:47:27.806]  This is my country.
[01:47:27.846 --> 01:47:28.786]  It's my grandbabies.
[01:47:28.806 --> 01:47:32.528]  I mean, I ask everybody listening to us right now, there's got to look around.
[01:47:32.569 --> 01:47:39.133]  There's got to be something or someone you love so much that you would give everything to protect.
[01:47:40.013 --> 01:47:41.354]  That's what this is about.
[01:47:41.414 --> 01:47:43.495]  This is about the great lady, our nation.
[01:47:44.336 --> 01:47:45.277]  That's what this is.
[01:47:45.297 --> 01:47:51.240]  I mean, we're talking about something right out in my front yard right now that does not go on in America.
[01:47:51.881 --> 01:47:54.002]  It went on in the old Soviet Union.
[01:47:54.062 --> 01:47:55.363]  I know I was there.
[01:47:56.348 --> 01:47:56.929]  Not here.
[01:47:57.650 --> 01:47:58.792]  Went on in Nicaragua.
[01:47:58.812 --> 01:47:59.633]  I know, I was there.
[01:47:59.653 --> 01:48:00.955]  Not here.
[01:48:00.975 --> 01:48:04.140]  But it's here now.
[01:48:05.703 --> 01:48:10.170]  And, uh... You know, Alex, there's just no time.
[01:48:10.190 --> 01:48:11.492]  There's just no time.
[01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:14.470]  Stay in contact.
[01:48:14.811 --> 01:48:16.592]  We're going to have us on speed dial.
[01:48:16.612 --> 01:48:18.113]  We're going to keep the Skype connected.
[01:48:18.133 --> 01:48:21.435]  We're not going to let them know when it's getting turned off by my friend.
[01:48:21.455 --> 01:48:23.756]  And we're going to stay in contact.
[01:48:23.776 --> 01:48:25.157]  And you'll be back with us tonight.
[01:48:25.197 --> 01:48:27.599]  The minute you have the info, let us know.
[01:48:27.639 --> 01:48:29.040]  We'll tape it for the nightly news.
[01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:30.181]  We'll get it out instantly.
[01:48:31.081 --> 01:48:36.685]  Because, yeah, they've got their operatives and other people, their wind-ups, that they've actually got lined up here in town.
[01:48:36.725 --> 01:48:38.766]  And believe me, we've got some of the same issues you've got.
[01:48:38.786 --> 01:48:41.068]  It'll take them a while to activate those people.
[01:48:42.329 --> 01:48:43.751]  Just keep it up and God bless you.
[01:48:45.737 --> 01:48:52.622]  You know, folks, I still got a pile of damn medicine I gotta get, and I got nothing to get it with, so I'm embarrassed as hell.
[01:48:52.982 --> 01:48:56.384]  Yeah, you've come out for 20 years and never asked for help, but you're broke and fighting cancer.
[01:48:56.424 --> 01:48:58.786]  NicholsLive at AOL.com.
[01:48:58.806 --> 01:49:03.729]  Folks really should donate and support you, and he's at 58 Kingsington Drive, Conway, Arkansas, 72034.
[01:49:03.970 --> 01:49:06.651]  Folks, roll up with your video cameras going.
[01:49:07.132 --> 01:49:08.292]  Don't be afraid of these guys.
[01:49:09.033 --> 01:49:14.457]  It's wise that you're by yourself if you're sick, not to go out there, but I wish I was there with you, because I know those guys will just drive off.
[01:49:15.017 --> 01:49:15.738]  But I tell you what.
[01:49:15.758 --> 01:49:16.299]  Yeah, man.
[01:49:17.941 --> 01:49:18.481]  No, I hear you.
[01:49:19.242 --> 01:49:19.583]  We'll meet.
[01:49:19.963 --> 01:49:20.364]  We'll meet.
[01:49:20.784 --> 01:49:22.146]  Alex, thanks, my brother.
[01:49:22.366 --> 01:49:23.468]  We'll talk later today.
[01:49:23.548 --> 01:49:24.108]  I promise you that.
[01:49:24.148 --> 01:49:24.529]  All right, buddy.
[01:49:24.549 --> 01:49:24.929]  Be safe.
[01:49:25.510 --> 01:49:25.770]  Thanks.
[01:49:25.811 --> 01:49:26.451]  There goes Larry Nichols.
[01:49:26.471 --> 01:49:26.772]  Thank you all.
[01:49:27.232 --> 01:49:27.513]  Thank you.
[01:49:27.553 --> 01:49:27.713]  Bye-bye.
[01:49:27.733 --> 01:49:29.836]  Can we have Richard Reeves now?
[01:49:31.821 --> 01:49:32.701]  Let's go to Richard Reeves.
[01:49:32.741 --> 01:49:33.702]  I can't skip this break.
[01:49:34.942 --> 01:49:36.603]  Richard, you heard what Larry Nichols was talking about.
[01:49:36.683 --> 01:49:38.404]  You were a listener back at the time.
[01:49:38.424 --> 01:49:39.164]  He was first coming on.
[01:49:39.184 --> 01:49:40.465]  He'd been working with us 15 years.
[01:49:40.485 --> 01:49:42.126]  I want to talk about the state of America.
[01:49:42.146 --> 01:49:45.567]  Then we're going to come back and talk about South Carolina, Donald Trump, this whole battle.
[01:49:45.827 --> 01:49:49.769]  But I tell you, Richard, if you're able to hear what Nichols is talking about, this is just chilling stuff.
[01:49:50.990 --> 01:49:56.792]  You can see the SUV that's there that drives off as soon as he comes out with the guys in suits, clearly trying to intimidate him.
[01:49:57.053 --> 01:49:58.353]  We've experienced that at Bilderberg.
[01:49:58.373 --> 01:49:59.094]  You've experienced it.
[01:49:59.114 --> 01:49:59.834]  We've got video of that.
[01:50:02.602 --> 01:50:03.163]  Stayed up, Richard.
[01:50:03.203 --> 01:50:03.463]  Thanks.
[01:50:03.824 --> 01:50:05.406]  Guys, we're... pipe your audio in.
[01:50:05.426 --> 01:50:05.907]  Go ahead, Richard.
[01:50:06.912 --> 01:50:08.073]  Yes, Alex, you're right.
[01:50:08.573 --> 01:50:13.256]  This is serious business and let's just, InfoWarriors, say prayers for Larry Nichols right now.
[01:50:14.117 --> 01:50:24.444]  I know if all the InfoWarriors take action with prayer that there's no way these guys in the SUV are going to touch Larry Nichols and they will immediately flee because that's what evil people do when the light shines upon them.
[01:50:24.504 --> 01:50:30.528]  So, let's just say our prayers that Larry Nichols is protected and is able to get out and defeat Hillary.
[01:50:30.568 --> 01:50:32.049]  Ultimately, all of us need to on that.
[01:50:33.451 --> 01:50:42.798]  It's just amazing how, I guess it's divine timing, that it seems like I frequently come on when Larry Nichols is either on or close to his appearances because it is critical.
[01:50:43.078 --> 01:50:47.341]  What we're seeing right now is the demise of not just Hillary Clinton, but also the Bushes.
[01:50:47.502 --> 01:50:52.606]  Last night, we came here to this venue, this Constitution-free city of North Charleston.
[01:50:53.689 --> 01:50:54.510]  South Carolina.
[01:50:55.131 --> 01:50:56.993]  And GW spoke with Jeb.
[01:50:57.233 --> 01:50:58.074]  We'll stay there.
[01:50:58.114 --> 01:50:59.195]  We're going to come right back.
[01:50:59.236 --> 01:50:59.516]  Richard.
[01:50:59.556 --> 01:51:00.837]  Richard Reeves in South Carolina.

[01:51:01.919 --> 01:51:02.720]  Trump wins this.

[01:51:04.402 --> 01:51:06.224]  And he's 20 to 30 points ahead right now.

[01:52:07.921 --> 01:52:11.403]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:52:12.144 --> 01:52:12.644]  It's true.
[01:52:12.764 --> 01:52:16.707]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:52:16.927 --> 01:52:18.788]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:52:19.308 --> 01:52:23.791]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[01:53:09.063 --> 01:53:10.303]  You've heard about bunkers.
[01:53:10.523 --> 01:53:13.065]  But surviving is not recreation.
[01:53:13.265 --> 01:53:15.786]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[01:53:37.307 --> 01:53:40.048]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:53:40.368 --> 01:53:42.969]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:53:42.989 --> 01:53:43.409]  Croix River.
[01:53:43.730 --> 01:53:45.730]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:53:45.971 --> 01:53:48.692]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:53:48.932 --> 01:53:49.452]  His excuse?
[01:53:49.812 --> 01:53:50.872]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:53:51.133 --> 01:53:52.433]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:53:52.753 --> 01:53:58.255]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[01:53:58.516 --> 01:53:59.256]  Don't wait.
[01:53:59.556 --> 01:54:01.917]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now.
[01:54:02.197 --> 01:54:04.438]  For not just your sake, but for the sake of your loved ones.

[01:54:16.297 --> 01:54:18.959]  Next hour, we have a news blitz.
[01:54:19.039 --> 01:54:21.641]  I'm going to cover the first 20 minutes of stuff I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:54:22.741 --> 01:54:26.044]  And then we have two different teams on the ground in Southwest Texas.
[01:54:27.265 --> 01:54:31.087]  They've been talking to the judges, the embalmers, something no one else is doing.
[01:54:34.209 --> 01:54:37.612]  We were already sending them down there yesterday, but I heard Michael Savage saying, where is the media?
[01:54:37.672 --> 01:54:38.532]  Where are the reporters?
[01:54:38.632 --> 01:54:39.853]  Where are the people that aren't cowards?
[01:54:40.374 --> 01:54:41.955]  I'm not up here saying I'm Mr. Tough Guy.
[01:54:43.695 --> 01:54:48.483]  When you think about it, these globalists want to keep babies alive and harvest their organs.
[01:54:51.267 --> 01:54:51.768]  They're evil!
[01:54:52.489 --> 01:54:54.332]  And good people have to stand up against them.
[01:54:55.734 --> 01:54:56.996]  Folks go, but they kill people!
[01:54:57.759 --> 01:55:00.260]  They're gonna kill everybody if we don't stand up against them!
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.781]  Back to Richard Reeves of South Carolina.
[01:55:02.821 --> 01:55:03.902]  Richard, key intel.
[01:55:05.222 --> 01:55:08.864]  Trump is surging after he came out and said that Bush wasn't a hero.
[01:55:08.904 --> 01:55:10.925]  He led us to get attacked by 9-11, bare minimum.
[01:55:11.185 --> 01:55:12.085]  That's revolutionary.
[01:55:12.145 --> 01:55:13.666]  Cheney's crawled out from under a rock.
[01:55:14.066 --> 01:55:15.387]  They're panicking right now.
[01:55:17.526 --> 01:55:19.728]  Boy, I tell you, Trump is the real deal, Richard.
[01:55:19.768 --> 01:55:20.528]  I gotta tell you, he is.
[01:55:20.868 --> 01:55:22.289]  He is the number one target, too.
[01:55:22.329 --> 01:55:23.150]  I'm really worried about him.
[01:55:23.891 --> 01:55:25.271]  Absolutely, he's the number one target.
[01:55:25.332 --> 01:55:32.717]  And Alex, I'll tell you what, the RNC did such a big mistake, another big mistake, this past Saturday when they stacked that audience.
[01:55:33.217 --> 01:55:50.212]  It was a little over a week ago that I came on live and popped in with David Knight that we talked about how the audience was stacked up in New Hampshire for the Saturday night debate and how that was a big mistake and how Donald Trump, when he really won that debate, was when he called out that audience and said, that's the donor class, that's up there, that's the lobbyists up there in the crowd.
[01:55:50.532 --> 01:55:51.693]  I think that was a winning moment.
[01:55:52.093 --> 01:55:57.879]  Then fast forward to last Saturday in South Carolina here at Greenville, South Carolina.
[01:55:58.759 --> 01:56:01.260]  And the RNC made that huge mistake.
[01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:07.062]  I'll tell you what, the meme and the theme here in South Carolina is no more Bushes, no more Clintons.
[01:56:07.462 --> 01:56:19.286]  And so this battle that's going on within the Republican Party for the primary, for the nomination, is going and flooding the Democrat race too with that meme of no more Bushes, no more Clintons.
[01:56:19.306 --> 01:56:26.849]  So that's another reason why Hillary's in trouble, because she's got this Republican race that's impacting her that I think they never anticipated.
[01:56:26.909 --> 01:56:29.971]  That's right, and you were here months ago obsessing over it, and you were right.
[01:56:30.971 --> 01:56:34.053]  And you had Stone and everything saying they're going to try to steal the superdelegates.
[01:56:34.834 --> 01:56:44.119]  But because the public's educated about it now, they dare not do that to Trump, they dare not do it to Hillary, as they keep stealing from Sanders when he wins by 20 points in New Hampshire.
[01:56:45.140 --> 01:56:47.441]  They're now admitting in the news she can't even do that again.
[01:56:47.481 --> 01:56:48.442]  It'll cause a revolution.
[01:56:49.223 --> 01:56:53.405]  They're doing the same old tricks they did decades ago in an awake public.
[01:56:53.465 --> 01:56:54.646]  It's not going to work, Richard.
[01:56:55.723 --> 01:56:57.705]  No, exactly, and that's just it.
[01:56:57.765 --> 01:56:58.285]  Picture this.
[01:56:59.346 --> 01:57:02.228]  One scenario I see is that they do steal the nomination for Hillary.
[01:57:02.248 --> 01:57:04.550]  They give it to her by a handful of delegates.
[01:57:05.050 --> 01:57:13.777]  The Bernie Sanders people will be so upset, so angry, they either go home and don't show up on General Election Day or cross over and vote for Trump.
[01:57:14.257 --> 01:57:15.057]  So, you know what?
[01:57:15.558 --> 01:57:20.502]  At this point, if Hillary gets the nomination or Sanders gets the nomination, I'm gonna flip a coin.
[01:57:20.542 --> 01:57:22.003]  Hey, flip a coin six times, right?
[01:57:22.603 --> 01:57:27.867]  So it doesn't really matter because the Democrats are just such in deep trouble with what's going on.
[01:57:28.267 --> 01:57:33.912]  But talking about what went on here last night, change the subject a little bit with George W. Bush.
[01:57:34.712 --> 01:57:36.114]  You know, I've been to a lot of events.
[01:57:36.174 --> 01:57:38.475]  I've been to, you know, Texas state conventions.
[01:57:38.555 --> 01:57:40.217]  I watched the RNC on TV.
[01:57:41.311 --> 01:57:50.419]  You could really feel the bad, the negative vibe in this room right behind me where George W. Bush spoke and Jeb Bush spoke afterwards.
[01:57:50.879 --> 01:57:51.840]  They just don't have it.
[01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:57.926]  The RNC, the Republican National Establishment, the Republican National Committee Establishment, they're on their last legs.
[01:57:57.946 --> 01:58:02.069]  They're a bunch of doddering, degenerate mafia scum and we're sick of them.
[01:58:02.830 --> 01:58:06.293]  And they got Saudi Arabia's hand up their rear puppeteering them.
[01:58:07.267 --> 01:58:19.591]  Yes, and fortunately the people around the United States, and especially here in South Carolina, where, you know, you've talked about how that you never expected to be speaking to the warrior class, and that's exactly what we have here in South Carolina.
[01:58:19.912 --> 01:58:21.772]  We have tons of warrior class.
[01:58:22.092 --> 01:58:23.193]  We have active duty.
[01:58:23.233 --> 01:58:25.073]  We have retired folks.
[01:58:25.113 --> 01:58:26.274]  We have, you know, the veterans.
[01:58:26.974 --> 01:58:37.001]  We have the families here, and then we have also the donor class, though, when it comes to the big budget guys, the ones that are benefiting from all this military spending.
[01:58:37.381 --> 01:58:44.646]  They're here as well, but I'll tell you what, the majority of folks that have got their feet on the street are going to be voting to oust the establishment.
[01:58:44.666 --> 01:58:45.007]  That's right.
[01:58:45.047 --> 01:58:45.667]  Stay there, Richard.

[02:00:00.484 --> 02:00:06.725]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:10.366 --> 02:00:22.188]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:22.628 --> 02:00:27.669]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:00:31.190 --> 02:00:37.871]  I tell you, there's nothing more entertaining than risking your life.
[02:00:39.972 --> 02:00:45.033]  You're never more alive than when you are standing right next to the Grim Reaper.
[02:00:46.833 --> 02:00:49.594]  And this country, this world standing next to the Grim Reaper.
[02:00:49.614 --> 02:00:52.954]  Coming up, I got tons of mainstream news saying World War III could be imminent.
[02:00:54.454 --> 02:00:57.055]  And again, you've got to admit it's imminent to stop it from happening.
[02:00:58.220 --> 02:01:02.361]  We've got the White House funded groups trying to start a race war in this country.
[02:01:02.401 --> 02:01:03.202]  New developments there.
[02:01:04.222 --> 02:01:06.443]  We've got just a bunch of news I'm going to get to in the next segment.
[02:01:06.463 --> 02:01:11.445]  And then we've got our reporters coming on from two different cities.
[02:01:11.465 --> 02:01:12.365]  We've got two different teams.
[02:01:14.727 --> 02:01:17.750]  Investigating the Scalia death, and again folks, I'm a media person.
[02:01:17.790 --> 02:01:18.811]  I've been doing this 21 years.
[02:01:19.311 --> 02:01:35.145]  It's unprecedented to have crickets out there on no autopsy, and the story changing, and all the weirdness, and it being a commando, black ops guy, donor that Obama made a special award for, who tells us the whole story of how Scalia died with a pillow over his head.
[02:01:35.165 --> 02:01:40.530]  I mean, maybe he did die of natural causes, and this script was written to make us think that killed him, because
[02:01:41.533 --> 02:01:42.634]  I'm sorry Richard, I'm ranting.
[02:01:43.034 --> 02:01:50.001]  I want you to come back on if you can in the fourth hour when Robb Dew is on because you've got so much good stuff to say and so much has happened.
[02:01:50.021 --> 02:01:53.705]  But in the few minutes we've got left, what else do you have to add, Richard, there in South Carolina?
[02:01:54.466 --> 02:02:03.695]  Well, with regard to the Antonin Scalia situation, the Supreme Court justice that passed away or probably met an untimely death by who knows what means.
[02:02:04.701 --> 02:02:18.127]  You know, it was just pure irony that on any other given day, Barack Obama probably has a roll of constitutional toilet paper that he picks up his dog's poop out of the White House lawn.
[02:02:18.587 --> 02:02:20.628]  You know, he's got two dogs named Bo and Sonny.
[02:02:21.469 --> 02:02:28.892]  And then on this given day, though, the judge passes away, the justice passes away, and he's out there citing his constitutional duty and responsibility.
[02:02:29.352 --> 02:02:29.872]  This is
[02:03:00.195 --> 02:03:03.263]  With the break earlier, you were going to finish up, too, with the Bushes last night.
[02:03:04.298 --> 02:03:04.978]  Yes, yes.
[02:03:05.478 --> 02:03:11.921]  You know, I've been enough of these events that I can kind of feel the pulse waning from the Republican establishment.
[02:03:12.221 --> 02:03:13.662]  Now, that doesn't mean they're going to go away.
[02:03:13.702 --> 02:03:14.862]  They're not going away, Alex.
[02:03:15.682 --> 02:03:19.944]  They do still have a delegate strategy, you know, because the New World Order will demand that.
[02:03:20.344 --> 02:03:25.066]  And the NWO has an electoral college strategy beyond when the nominees are selected.
[02:03:25.486 --> 02:03:30.328]  We can talk about that in upcoming shows, but for now we'll talk about they still have a delegate strategy.
[02:03:30.908 --> 02:03:32.749]  We see how they can turn out an audience.
[02:03:33.070 --> 02:03:34.110]  They've proved it twice now.
[02:03:34.150 --> 02:03:35.271]  They've proved it more than twice.
[02:03:35.351 --> 02:03:36.252]  I've seen it before.
[02:03:36.612 --> 02:03:40.355]  But in New Hampshire, they proved how they can turn out their establishment audience.
[02:03:40.735 --> 02:03:42.196]  They proved this last week.
[02:03:42.236 --> 02:03:51.742]  It's like the movie Gladiator with Maximus, where they just keep piling more and more people in trying to kill him, and they can't do it, and they're turning him into a hero.
[02:03:52.123 --> 02:03:53.744]  It's totally obvious that it's rigged.
[02:03:54.622 --> 02:04:05.849]  No, and you know, it really worked out in so many ways because I think that really did get Donald Trump upset, and that's why he started breaking out with some 9-11 truth.
[02:04:05.950 --> 02:04:06.790]  They have no idea.
[02:04:06.810 --> 02:04:07.751]  I had it telegraphed.
[02:04:07.791 --> 02:04:08.571]  I'm just going to say that.
[02:04:09.232 --> 02:04:11.913]  Well, three months ago when you brought the Trump folks in here.
[02:04:11.933 --> 02:04:19.839]  It was telegraphed, but them bringing in that audience to really kind of light the fuse to Donald Trump, that's what really just... No, no, I agree.
[02:04:19.919 --> 02:04:21.240]  I'm just saying the establishment
[02:04:21.900 --> 02:04:22.761]  That's why they're so scared of him.
[02:04:22.781 --> 02:04:24.281]  They know Trump actually knows what's going on.
[02:04:24.942 --> 02:04:25.142]  Right.
[02:04:25.702 --> 02:04:32.046]  Richard, I want to come back, actually, because the delegate process, you're an expert on this, you know, you've been a delegate, you're involved, precinct chair, all that stuff.
[02:04:33.368 --> 02:04:36.049]  You have been obsessing on this for the 14 years I've known you.
[02:04:36.409 --> 02:04:41.610]  Or no, I've known you, like, you've been working for us off and on 14 years, but I've known you longer than that.
[02:04:41.630 --> 02:04:43.671]  But you've been obsessing on it for 14 years.
[02:04:44.051 --> 02:04:52.193]  Come back, spend five minutes on the delegate process, how that finally woke folks up when Hillary lost by 20 points but still got more delegates in New Hampshire.
[02:04:52.213 --> 02:04:54.333]  Then I'm gonna hit all the news I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:04:54.394 --> 02:04:55.774]  Richard Reeves from South Carolina.
[02:04:57.078 --> 02:04:57.779]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:04:58.119 --> 02:05:02.341]  I think it's pretty clear now, if you're a new viewer or listener, we're doing pretty important stuff here.
[02:05:02.381 --> 02:05:03.881]  The enemy doesn't want this stuff getting out.
[02:05:04.502 --> 02:05:07.163]  Please help us spread the video and audio links in our articles.
[02:05:09.554 --> 02:05:20.821]  We have previously seen 3D printing technology bring us things like simple household items, more advanced components of firearms, and now it's being reported that they can even produce body parts.
[02:05:21.321 --> 02:05:33.429]  A team at Wake Forest University has used a combination of living cells and a special gel to print out human body parts, including ears, muscles, and jaw bones, reports NBC News.
[02:05:33.789 --> 02:05:44.953]  It's an advance on previous attempts which either involved making a plastic scaffold and then trying to get cells to grow in and on it or that printed out organ shapes that ended up being too floppy and dying.
[02:05:45.233 --> 02:05:52.475]  The new approach mixes live cells with a gel that starts out as liquid but quickly hardens to the consistency of living tissue.
[02:05:52.755 --> 02:05:55.516]  The challenge of making living tissue is complicated.
[02:05:55.876 --> 02:06:01.898]  Even a simple structure like an ear has several types of cells and they must all be fed by tiny capillaries.
[02:06:02.438 --> 02:06:05.440]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[02:06:05.460 --> 02:06:09.121]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:06:09.241 --> 02:06:09.682]  Good, brother.
[02:06:09.802 --> 02:06:11.523]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:06:11.543 --> 02:06:13.323]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:06:13.484 --> 02:06:17.486]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:06:17.506 --> 02:06:20.087]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[02:06:20.127 --> 02:06:22.388]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:06:22.548 --> 02:06:30.492]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:06:30.832 --> 02:06:33.836]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[02:06:33.956 --> 02:06:35.458]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:06:35.498 --> 02:06:39.903]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, saving a ton of money there.
[02:06:40.183 --> 02:06:45.589]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:46.890]  We're good to go.
[02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:15.182]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.
[02:07:15.442 --> 02:07:24.924]  At InfoWarsLife, our mission is to bring you the highest quality, purest, cleanest, effective colloidal silver on the market today for the lowest price available.

[02:08:01.224 --> 02:08:01.885]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:08:01.945 --> 02:08:03.647]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:33.433 --> 02:08:47.527]  People like Barry Goldwater and countless others 40, 50 years ago wrote books, they gave speeches, they warned us about everything happening.
[02:08:48.948 --> 02:08:56.876]  Then the CIA run by British intelligence and others was able to take over the Republican Party
[02:08:58.533 --> 02:09:03.536]  Through National Review and other movements, they double-crossed Richard Nixon because he didn't want to shut the country down.
[02:09:04.356 --> 02:09:06.737]  Kicked him out for minor crimes compared to what they planned.
[02:09:06.757 --> 02:09:07.918]  This has all come out.
[02:09:08.758 --> 02:09:09.599]  Kissinger set him up.
[02:09:12.700 --> 02:09:16.382]  And now they intend to basically finish the country off.
[02:09:16.662 --> 02:09:18.863]  They've already moved their industries overseas.
[02:09:20.484 --> 02:09:22.245]  And to make the country a minor power.
[02:09:22.325 --> 02:09:23.926]  Everything they've done is to destroy the nation.
[02:09:26.323 --> 02:09:36.049]  But there was a generation of libertarian conservatives and just patriots that heard Barry Goldwater, who was in the Senate intelligence meetings and was told all this stuff.
[02:09:36.069 --> 02:09:39.932]  We're going to merge world government, we're going to take rights away, we're going to end the family.
[02:09:39.952 --> 02:09:40.812]  And he said, you're crazy.
[02:09:41.212 --> 02:09:42.233]  He went out and told everybody.
[02:09:46.155 --> 02:09:48.097]  And it was others as well, not just him.
[02:09:49.807 --> 02:09:52.090]  The John Bergers and others were just 100% dead on.
[02:09:52.311 --> 02:09:53.492]  I mean, just absolutely, they had it.
[02:09:53.532 --> 02:09:53.793]  Boom.
[02:09:53.993 --> 02:09:57.878]  Because they had all these insiders in government that weren't traitors giving them the actual battle plans.
[02:09:58.860 --> 02:10:00.983]  It's literally, they had the battle plans.
[02:10:04.488 --> 02:10:09.154]  And so the media then demonized for decades that group, people that were white, but they knew.
[02:10:09.215 --> 02:10:10.476]  They'd seen the documents.
[02:10:10.496 --> 02:10:14.382]  And then, oh, now you see everything they warned about coming to fruition.
[02:10:14.662 --> 02:10:20.450]  And the globalists admit they're about 15 years behind because of those movements in the 50s and 60s.
[02:10:23.208 --> 02:10:24.309]  And now look how they were.
[02:10:24.729 --> 02:10:27.770]  A good-sized wave, but nothing compared to the waves that came.
[02:10:29.531 --> 02:10:37.195]  And now they're not going to just have superdelegates and steal elections and just say, conspiracy theory on the news, and then steal the nomination.
[02:10:37.655 --> 02:10:39.856]  Now there's going to be a debate about how the delegates work.
[02:10:40.256 --> 02:10:42.557]  There's going to be a debate about how the parties.
[02:10:42.657 --> 02:10:47.780]  In 1972, the Democrats changed the rules, where the party decides with the superdelegates.
[02:10:49.104 --> 02:10:50.145]  The public's going, what?
[02:10:50.205 --> 02:10:51.106]  You mean it's rigged?
[02:10:51.486 --> 02:10:52.166]  Yeah!
[02:10:52.206 --> 02:10:54.648]  See, now we can have these debates.
[02:10:54.788 --> 02:11:06.117]  Now we can expose what's happening because of the countless people that wrote books and had radio shows and called into radio shows and called into C-SPAN and got made fun of and everything.
[02:11:06.437 --> 02:11:08.399]  You look at the culture now, we've taken over.
[02:11:10.674 --> 02:11:17.419]  So they go, no one will question Scalia's death, it was natural, no autopsy, an anonymous phone call, nothing to see here, move along.
[02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:19.101]  We went, hey, that looks pretty suspicious.
[02:11:19.361 --> 02:11:20.042]  Shut up, kook.
[02:11:20.662 --> 02:11:24.265]  And then now detectives all over the country, head detectives in New York and D.C.
[02:11:24.605 --> 02:11:28.569]  are coming out saying this is outrageous, this just totally stinks to high heaven.
[02:11:30.090 --> 02:11:32.111]  Oh, you weren't able to shut us down.
[02:11:32.352 --> 02:11:34.954]  And here's the deal, put a bullet in my head, set me up, put me in prison.
[02:11:35.174 --> 02:11:37.236]  They got lots of stuff, you know, they've been trying to cook.
[02:11:38.021 --> 02:11:47.707]  The problem is their own system won't do it, and their own system knows we're good, and there's people in there exposing the criminal elements, so they more and more are actually on their heels.
[02:11:48.588 --> 02:11:50.089]  They're not just flat-footed, they're in trouble.
[02:11:50.389 --> 02:11:53.451]  That's why they're doing bold moves and letting everybody know they killed Scalia.
[02:11:54.191 --> 02:11:59.174]  Or if they didn't, they came up with a, because they're smart, with a report that makes it look like they did.
[02:11:59.194 --> 02:12:01.236]  Do you understand how key that is?
[02:12:03.780 --> 02:12:05.601]  There was a pillow on his face, too.
[02:12:07.422 --> 02:12:09.664]  I'm at the line, I was getting special awards for myself.
[02:12:10.184 --> 02:12:12.906]  I mean, you'd have to be a moron not to see this message.
[02:12:13.366 --> 02:12:14.247]  Just like the Godfather.
[02:12:17.269 --> 02:12:19.410]  They're getting attacked, they're getting taken out by another family.
[02:12:20.011 --> 02:12:22.252]  All of a sudden there's a... This just got delivered.
[02:12:22.813 --> 02:12:23.313]  Open it up.
[02:12:24.254 --> 02:12:27.055]  It's brown paper with a bulletproof vest with fish in it.
[02:12:27.075 --> 02:12:28.236]  They go, what's this?
[02:12:28.636 --> 02:12:29.757]  It's a Sicilian message.
[02:12:30.277 --> 02:12:32.259]  It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.
[02:12:34.665 --> 02:12:37.108]  You think it's just the Italian Mafia that sends messages?
[02:12:37.128 --> 02:12:38.409]  That's the oldest thing in the world!
[02:12:40.472 --> 02:12:42.114]  The Romans, you know, would salt the earth.
[02:12:42.214 --> 02:12:43.796]  You know, the British would put your heads on pikes.
[02:12:44.137 --> 02:12:46.420]  If I had the impeller, I'd put people on spikes!
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:47.581]  It's a message!
[02:12:49.624 --> 02:12:52.587]  I'm surprised they didn't have a severed head of a horse in the bed with him dead!
[02:12:53.502 --> 02:12:56.603]  Or maybe cut his head off, like Arkansasides, and say it was that.
[02:12:56.903 --> 02:13:07.967]  Richard, just encapsulate the delegate process, why it's so important, and it's got to excite you to see it one of the biggest stories now, when Hillary arrogantly steals an election in New Hampshire, and, you know, steals it in Iowa.
[02:13:08.007 --> 02:13:09.147]  People aren't buying it anymore.
[02:13:09.367 --> 02:13:14.669]  I mean, the veil's really coming back because they're having to exert all their fraud now to stay in control.
[02:13:15.879 --> 02:13:22.925]  That's right Alex, and ultimately what it is, is when you've got these state primaries and state caucuses, picture them more like just beauty contests.
[02:13:23.425 --> 02:13:26.488]  These are beauty contests that lead up to the big conventions.
[02:13:26.908 --> 02:13:31.653]  And it's those delegates, those delegates on the convention floor that ultimately make the decision
[02:13:32.373 --> 02:13:35.394]  Who their nominee is going to be on the Democrat side, Republican side.
[02:13:35.754 --> 02:13:49.639]  Now traditionally, for the last however many decades, for decades literally, the establishment Democrats have controlled their delegations in the Democrat Nomination Commission Convention and same thing on the Republican side.
[02:13:49.679 --> 02:13:50.279]  We've seen that.
[02:13:50.319 --> 02:13:51.440]  They've just taken it for granted.
[02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:55.281]  That they're large and in charge, that they cannot be overthrown.
[02:13:55.321 --> 02:14:05.684]  But the good news is, is that info warriors, patriots, and revolutionaries on both sides, left and right, whether they're wrong or incorrect, they are infiltrating these operations.
[02:14:05.984 --> 02:14:11.406]  The question will be, is will they infiltrate the operations in big enough numbers to make the difference?
[02:14:12.046 --> 02:14:17.248]  I think absolutely it's got to happen this cycle on the Republican side, and fortunately
[02:14:17.768 --> 02:14:19.289]  We've had warm-ups to this.
[02:14:19.329 --> 02:14:21.731]  We had the 2008 warm-up with Ron Paul.
[02:14:22.032 --> 02:14:25.014]  We had the 2012 warm-up with Ron Paul once again.
[02:14:25.334 --> 02:14:34.222]  And Alex, that's another thing that needs to happen is there needs to be a conversation with Rand Paul here because potentially the Rand Paul faction in my book would have probably represented
[02:14:34.742 --> 02:14:38.185]  About 20 to 30 percent of the delegates showing up to Cleveland.
[02:14:38.466 --> 02:14:44.671]  So Rand Paul dropping out, that could be a big loss to our cause if those folks stay home.
[02:14:44.751 --> 02:14:56.101]  If they don't act, that could be very detrimental because it's going to be those patriots, those liberty seekers and info warriors that get up to Cleveland that are going to overthrow the president.
[02:14:56.161 --> 02:15:00.826]  You know, I actually agree with you, and I obviously want to call Rand Paul up, but
[02:15:01.661 --> 02:15:02.741]  I think it needs to happen, Alex.
[02:15:02.761 --> 02:15:03.702]  I encourage you to call Rand Paul.
[02:15:03.722 --> 02:15:04.482]  I'm going to reach out to him.
[02:15:04.902 --> 02:15:06.723]  I'm going to reach out to him and come on as a guest on the show.
[02:15:06.743 --> 02:15:11.625]  I'll be able to go through back channels and get around to his would-be handlers, some of his staff.
[02:15:11.645 --> 02:15:13.525]  Some of them are good, some of them are just atrocious.
[02:15:14.206 --> 02:15:15.946]  And I'm just honest about that because I respect Rand Paul.
[02:15:15.966 --> 02:15:16.506]  He's a great man.
[02:15:16.526 --> 02:15:17.507]  I wish he would become president.
[02:15:18.687 --> 02:15:20.368]  I know that he's good.
[02:15:20.488 --> 02:15:22.408]  I trust him.
[02:15:23.389 --> 02:15:24.829]  But here's the deal.
[02:15:26.830 --> 02:15:28.971]  We know Bernie Sanders and Hillary are pure evil.
[02:15:29.980 --> 02:15:33.041]  We know the whole power structure's against Trump.
[02:15:34.181 --> 02:15:40.062]  Trump is now getting more Rand Paul-ish, exposing the stand down on 9-11, exposing these wars are wrong.
[02:15:41.002 --> 02:15:44.622]  And so, you know, maybe if he came out and said, I'd like to meet with Trump.
[02:15:45.583 --> 02:15:51.624]  I know we've disagreed a lot and I've said some bad things, but maybe, you know, maybe he'll actually listen to me a little bit.
[02:15:52.544 --> 02:15:57.605]  Like when we used to play golf, maybe I could get behind him because, you know, he just said some things that rubbed him the wrong way.
[02:15:58.065 --> 02:15:58.945]  Have an olive branch.
[02:16:00.131 --> 02:16:08.853]  Do that, because the way his polls have also fallen in Kentucky, precipitously since he came out against Trump eight months ago, is attacking Trump.
[02:16:08.933 --> 02:16:11.054]  Trump represents populism, Rand.
[02:16:11.074 --> 02:16:15.555]  I know your politicos don't tell you this, but you're a smart guy, Dr. Paul.
[02:16:16.275 --> 02:16:17.755]  He represents populism.
[02:16:18.715 --> 02:16:25.297]  And it doesn't mean you have to fully endorse him, but just like Lou Rockwell, who helped get your dad elected, said here just last week,
[02:16:27.332 --> 02:16:31.683]  Donald Trump's the best of what we got, and you can't go against him because he represents populism.
[02:16:32.144 --> 02:16:33.186]  That will hurt you.
[02:16:33.367 --> 02:16:34.770]  You will probably lose the Senate.
[02:16:35.845 --> 02:16:40.346]  If you don't go anti-establishment and just come out and just endorse Trump.
[02:16:41.027 --> 02:16:41.247]  Okay?
[02:16:41.267 --> 02:16:42.307]  I mean, you need to do it.
[02:16:43.207 --> 02:16:44.107]  And it needs to happen.
[02:16:45.588 --> 02:16:46.988]  Because I want you to stay in the Senate.
[02:16:47.268 --> 02:16:50.889]  And then down the road, you're so young, end up being President, man!
[02:16:50.929 --> 02:16:51.350]  Come on!
[02:16:51.450 --> 02:16:52.130]  Use your brain!
[02:16:52.670 --> 02:17:02.693]  And I don't like to sit here and lecture people, but I know what I'm doing, from 21 years old, building one of the biggest independent media operations that reaches 28 million people a week conservatively,
[02:17:03.453 --> 02:17:10.198]  And it's changing, you know, the world with our empowered listeners that, believe me, I don't know how you could see that any different.
[02:17:10.879 --> 02:17:11.119]  Okay?
[02:17:12.714 --> 02:17:15.436]  I'm sorry Richard, I've got news to cover and I'm ranting.
[02:17:15.736 --> 02:17:20.519]  I'll tell you what Alex, what you just covered is so important, I don't even know if you realize how important it is.
[02:17:20.659 --> 02:17:32.927]  I'm telling you, the Rand Paul faction, they can send 20 or 30 percent of the whole delegation that shows up in Cleveland, 20 or 30 percent of that could be made up of Rand Paul folks alone.
[02:17:33.347 --> 02:17:38.130]  That's a big chip in Rand Paul's corner and they could deliver a Donald Trump
[02:17:38.750 --> 02:17:39.571]  Absolutely.
[02:17:39.651 --> 02:17:43.713]  I mean, Rand Paul is a great guy, and he shouldn't make it a contest, you know, over egos.
[02:17:43.733 --> 02:17:44.934]  But I would say the same thing.
[02:17:44.954 --> 02:17:45.574]  You know, the Trump people,
[02:18:08.306 --> 02:18:09.767]  Our country's at stake, Alex.
[02:18:09.807 --> 02:18:10.667]  Our country's at stake here.
[02:18:10.687 --> 02:18:13.929]  The Trump people need to, behind the scenes, do an olive branch to Rand Paul.
[02:18:15.870 --> 02:18:16.991]  It needs to be a two-way street.
[02:18:17.111 --> 02:18:20.252]  You know, whoever does it, let's just get it done because it's gotta happen.
[02:18:20.292 --> 02:18:20.893]  It's gotta happen.
[02:18:20.913 --> 02:18:21.733]  What about Ted Cruz?
[02:18:21.753 --> 02:18:24.114]  You know, I love the stuff he does against the Federal Reserve.
[02:18:24.154 --> 02:18:26.255]  I love how he exposes Al-Qaeda being globalist-run.
[02:18:26.616 --> 02:18:28.116]  I love how he stands up for the Second Amendment.
[02:18:28.797 --> 02:18:31.158]  I just love so much of what he's been doing.
[02:18:32.099 --> 02:18:34.600]  And then to see him pull really nasty tricks, I mean,
[02:18:35.805 --> 02:18:36.926]  Other people could have pulled those tricks.
[02:18:36.946 --> 02:18:37.806]  Those are standard tricks.
[02:18:38.427 --> 02:18:42.849]  And then he just... Man, there's just something so... You talk about robotic.
[02:18:42.949 --> 02:18:44.630]  Rubio's like the dumb robot.
[02:18:45.311 --> 02:18:48.012]  And then Cruz is like a super robot.
[02:18:48.092 --> 02:18:50.694]  Because he always knows what to say and always what to do.
[02:18:50.734 --> 02:18:54.836]  But then behind the scenes, leaves a trail of really nastiness.
[02:18:56.397 --> 02:18:58.758]  Alex, that is very interesting to find out what's going on.
[02:18:58.839 --> 02:19:00.880]  And he doesn't necessarily... The only thing he's ever...
[02:19:01.536 --> 02:19:05.498]  You know, kind of taking the responsibility for is what happened with Carson up in Iowa.
[02:19:05.918 --> 02:19:11.581]  But you do have to wonder if there's not other dirty tricks by other enemies doing some of these shenanigans.
[02:19:11.661 --> 02:19:19.605]  We never had confirmation one way or the other about, you know, Donald Trump said there was some really nasty robocalls going out that are implemented by the Cruz campaign.
[02:19:20.025 --> 02:19:21.987]  I haven't been able to confirm that one way or the other.
[02:19:22.007 --> 02:19:24.148]  And so it's just interesting to see.
[02:19:24.308 --> 02:19:25.168]  What is your bottom line?
[02:19:25.208 --> 02:19:26.329]  What is your bottom line on Cruz?
[02:19:26.929 --> 02:19:28.270]  Well, the bottom line is this, Alex.
[02:19:28.310 --> 02:19:31.552]  You and I talked about it several years back when Cruz was running for Senate.
[02:19:31.952 --> 02:19:33.333]  I like what Cruz had to say.
[02:19:33.653 --> 02:19:35.475]  If nothing else, he's waking people up.
[02:19:35.775 --> 02:19:38.056]  If nothing else, he's bringing home the liberty message.
[02:19:38.617 --> 02:19:41.659]  Basically, almost, 100%, almost in for a warrior message.
[02:19:41.959 --> 02:19:43.680]  So, Ted Cruz, keep saying what you're saying.
[02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:47.342]  Keep bringing people into this revolution of taking our country back.
[02:19:47.442 --> 02:19:47.763]  Absolutely.
[02:19:47.803 --> 02:19:48.503]  And you know what?
[02:19:48.683 --> 02:19:51.045]  If you betray us in the long run, at least you woke people up.
[02:19:51.943 --> 02:19:52.584]  That's a good point.
[02:19:52.624 --> 02:19:59.590]  I mean, Bernie Sanders is an avowed communist who openly never worked until he was 40, until he got a government job and wants to put us basically in forced labor camps.
[02:19:59.610 --> 02:20:01.431]  I mean, that's what socialism and communism is.
[02:20:01.691 --> 02:20:04.114]  Hillary's just a flaming, crazy tyrant.
[02:20:04.834 --> 02:20:07.797]  Just a bloodthirsty, bloodbath demon.
[02:20:11.829 --> 02:20:18.293]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a SelectQuote agent with a true story of how SelectQuote goes to bat for you buying term life insurance.
[02:20:19.234 --> 02:20:22.016]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[02:20:22.856 --> 02:20:26.539]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[02:20:27.199 --> 02:20:28.440]  I said, let me see.
[02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:39.604]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly-rated, price-competitive companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[02:20:40.084 --> 02:20:51.229]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.

[02:24:16.300 --> 02:24:18.708]  Wayne Madsen is joining us here in a moment.
[02:24:18.728 --> 02:24:23.101]  Investigative journalist for InfoWars.com and WayneMadsenReport.com
[02:24:24.657 --> 02:24:27.739]  On the ground in El Paso, Texas, where Scalia's body was taken.
[02:24:27.819 --> 02:24:30.461]  And there's been no investigation by the media of what was done with it.
[02:24:30.481 --> 02:24:32.643]  We're trying to actually talk to the folks at the funeral home.
[02:24:33.523 --> 02:24:34.524]  He's successfully done it.
[02:24:34.584 --> 02:24:36.965]  He's got big news here for us in a moment.
[02:24:37.246 --> 02:24:43.110]  We've also interviewed, now I'm told what I think, both the judges that were just announcing he was dead and all the rest of this.
[02:24:43.330 --> 02:24:47.192]  And our crew is on its way to the ranch as we speak.
[02:24:47.252 --> 02:24:50.074]  Two different crews, five people total.
[02:24:51.335 --> 02:24:54.858]  Right now, they're on the ground in Southwest Texas.
[02:24:55.198 --> 02:24:56.199]  Madsen's by himself.
[02:24:56.219 --> 02:24:57.921]  He'll be linking up with the team tomorrow.
[02:24:57.941 --> 02:24:59.642]  That's why he joins us via telephone.
[02:24:59.662 --> 02:25:01.784]  But look at this article out of the New York Post.
[02:25:02.945 --> 02:25:05.767]  Detectives question lack of autopsy in Scalia's death.
[02:25:06.768 --> 02:25:11.772]  Bill Ritchie, a retired deputy chief and former head of criminal investigations for the DC police,
[02:25:12.779 --> 02:25:15.861]  Said he was dumbstruck when he learned that no autopsy would be performed.
[02:25:16.582 --> 02:25:22.907]  Oh, then we've got another head detective, and then another head detective, and we've got the New York top retired detective.
[02:25:22.927 --> 02:25:27.290]  I mean, I've already gone over all this, but the point is, dumbstruck.
[02:25:28.171 --> 02:25:34.556]  See, I said I'm dumbstruck by them instantly announcing no foul play, go to sleep, nothing happened, an anonymous call said.
[02:25:34.576 --> 02:25:37.839]  I mean, that just is insane.
[02:25:39.235 --> 02:25:44.338]  And then I said, Saturday night, I said, if they claim no autopsy real fast, get ready.
[02:25:44.798 --> 02:25:46.679]  And then the rest of the story started changing.
[02:25:47.179 --> 02:25:51.682]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is ridiculous.
[02:25:53.483 --> 02:25:56.264]  And then they go on to point the pillow over the head.
[02:25:58.606 --> 02:26:00.767]  Why would you tell us there was a pillow over the head?
[02:26:02.988 --> 02:26:04.569]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[02:26:05.253 --> 02:26:06.654]  Joining us is Wayne Madsen.
[02:26:06.714 --> 02:26:09.355]  Wayne, great job getting out there so quick.
[02:26:09.375 --> 02:26:14.097]  It's only going to take a few flights from where you're at on the East Coast to get to El Paso.
[02:26:14.137 --> 02:26:17.018]  Our team's a few hundred miles away from you in this giant state.
[02:26:17.258 --> 02:26:21.740]  You're going to be meeting up with them soon, actually out there at the ranch itself.
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:24.621]  Wayne, tell us exactly what you've discovered since you got on the ground.
[02:26:26.022 --> 02:26:33.925]  Well, I dropped by the funeral home where they actually took Scalia's body from the ranch.
[02:26:35.014 --> 02:26:35.815]  We're good to go.
[02:26:58.054 --> 02:27:01.938]  Um, which is probably about a 20 minute drive from the ranch.
[02:27:01.958 --> 02:27:05.242]  Sent a Cadillac first to pick up the body.
[02:27:05.762 --> 02:27:11.789]  But, you know, I mean, what's odd is they could have, there's an airstrip over there near the ranch.
[02:27:11.849 --> 02:27:16.834]  They could have flown the body to El Paso, but you know, they chose
[02:27:17.738 --> 02:27:32.241]  This sort of motorcade of a Cadillac first and an accompanying white SUV that drove three and a half hours to get to El Paso, where of course there was no autopsy performed.
[02:27:32.281 --> 02:27:43.944]  Now, I just stopped by the funeral home where he was taken, Sunset Funeral Home, and I actually spoke to the guy who embalmed Justice Scalia's body.
[02:27:45.778 --> 02:27:46.459]  Well, good job.
[02:27:46.519 --> 02:27:48.061]  Nobody else has done that that I know of.
[02:27:48.101 --> 02:27:49.904]  Good job, Wayne.
[02:27:50.425 --> 02:27:52.728]  Well, I mean, it gets even more interesting.
[02:27:53.048 --> 02:27:57.715]  On the outside, and of course, I have to preface this by saying the funeral home
[02:27:58.374 --> 02:28:02.016]  Uh, is preparing an official public release, uh, statement.
[02:28:02.497 --> 02:28:06.639]  So, you know, to protect the privacy, honor the privacy of Leah's family.
[02:28:06.659 --> 02:28:18.207]  Uh, I was not given any details, uh, per se, but, um, I, I did ask about what is the normal procedure to get rid of the bodily fluids after an embalming?
[02:28:18.227 --> 02:28:22.670]  That would be, you know, the blood and other, um, fluids drained from the body.
[02:28:22.690 --> 02:28:24.791]  Uh, well, I'm, I, um,
[02:28:26.183 --> 02:28:34.489]  To my chagrin, I discovered that the bodily fluids were basically flushed into the El Paso Municipal Sewage System.
[02:28:36.450 --> 02:28:39.392]  So, you know, no special precautions taken.
[02:28:39.652 --> 02:28:43.715]  They weren't sealed for possible future analysis.
[02:28:44.255 --> 02:28:49.439]  I mean, even though an autopsy wasn't performed, I understand that the blood
[02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:53.783]  and urine could yield some toxicology results.
[02:28:53.823 --> 02:28:55.705]  Well obviously, that's a huge deal.
[02:28:55.825 --> 02:29:01.050]  Headline, funeral home, Scalia's bodily fluids dumped down the drain.
[02:29:01.070 --> 02:29:03.972]  Basically down the drain, yeah.
[02:29:04.352 --> 02:29:06.014]  And that is Texas law.
[02:29:06.034 --> 02:29:06.354]  There's no
[02:29:07.651 --> 02:29:13.897]  As far as biohazards or any of that, I mean, that's another interesting side part of this.
[02:29:13.997 --> 02:29:14.958]  We're about to go to break.
[02:29:14.998 --> 02:29:16.860]  Come back and tell us more of what you discovered.
[02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:27.251]  But just briefly, how big a deal is it that detectives all over the country, senior detectives, you know, over homicide investigations, are saying this is just dumbfounding what's happening?
[02:29:28.188 --> 02:29:33.089]  Well, I hope to get Mr. Ritchie, the retired homicide detective in D.C.
[02:29:33.249 --> 02:29:43.592]  I hope to try to contact him at some point because he's certainly dealt with enough of these high visibility deaths in the District of Columbia for a number of years.
[02:29:43.752 --> 02:29:44.853]  I didn't think of that angle.
[02:29:44.913 --> 02:29:45.313]  Stay there.
[02:29:45.393 --> 02:29:46.233]  Let's talk about that.
[02:29:46.713 --> 02:29:48.154]  Straight ahead, absolutely.
[02:29:48.214 --> 02:29:49.214]  He's an expert.
[02:29:49.234 --> 02:29:50.094]  He ran the division.
[02:29:50.774 --> 02:29:51.775]  So think about that.
[02:29:51.795 --> 02:29:54.015]  And he's saying this totally stinks to high heaven.
[02:29:54.655 --> 02:29:56.036]  And he deals with all the murders in D.C.
[02:29:57.901 --> 02:30:00.903]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.823 --> 02:30:04.625]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:08.988 --> 02:30:22.997]  Russian warplanes are being blamed for carrying out what is being described as a deliberate attack on two makeshift hospitals and a school in northern Syria Monday that killed nearly 50 people, according to the United Nations, reports Fox News.
[02:30:23.897 --> 02:30:30.241]  Doctors Without Borders said that the hospital was hit four times in at least two attacks that were minutes apart.
[02:30:30.822 --> 02:30:35.905]  A third air raid hit a school in a nearby village, killing seven and wounding others.
[02:30:36.246 --> 02:30:45.252]  The Russian Prime Minister issued a blanket denial over the weekend that Moscow was targeting civilians in civilian facilities in Syria, reports The Guardian.
[02:30:45.592 --> 02:30:45.812]  U.S.
[02:30:45.852 --> 02:30:52.978]  Military Colonel Steve Warren on Twitter said the destruction of the Doctors Without Borders hospital was quote, terrible news.
[02:30:53.298 --> 02:30:54.620]  But last year the U.S.
[02:30:54.680 --> 02:30:59.043]  itself hit a Doctors Without Borders facility in Afghanistan killing 30 people.
[02:30:59.343 --> 02:31:01.725]  It was chalked up to a quote, human error.
[02:31:02.266 --> 02:31:05.168]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[02:33:12.233 --> 02:33:13.734]  We are on the march.
[02:33:14.094 --> 02:33:16.516]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:33:17.257 --> 02:33:21.040]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:21.060 --> 02:33:29.366]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got five reporters and crew down in southwest Texas.
[02:33:29.426 --> 02:33:32.448]  It is just a gigantic area.
[02:33:33.008 --> 02:33:40.234]  In between towns, routinely, we are talking about hundreds of miles.
[02:33:41.466 --> 02:33:46.653]  Now we have a video Skype connection right now with David Knight and we're establishing that right now.
[02:33:46.753 --> 02:33:47.795]  Joe Biggs is down there.
[02:33:48.335 --> 02:33:48.936]  They are...
[02:33:50.031 --> 02:33:50.871]  Closer to the ranch.
[02:33:51.792 --> 02:33:52.472]  About to be there.
[02:33:53.072 --> 02:34:01.816]  But then we also have Wayne Madsen, investigative journalist, who is in El Paso and was just going over the amazing fact that they did indeed embalm him.
[02:34:01.836 --> 02:34:03.697]  The media was trying to find that out and they wouldn't say.
[02:34:03.717 --> 02:34:09.860]  And that his blood, and I guess what was in his guts, the rest of it, was I guess just dumped down the drain.
[02:34:10.480 --> 02:34:12.521]  You know, just don't want to save any of that and see what happened.
[02:34:12.881 --> 02:34:14.082]  Just found the pillow over his head.
[02:34:14.502 --> 02:34:18.864]  And we've got all these prominent detectives, some of them heads of homicide.
[02:34:20.646 --> 02:34:23.670]  Former, current, you name it, just saying that they're, quote, dumbfounded.
[02:34:25.953 --> 02:34:27.214]  And it's the speed of all this.
[02:34:27.315 --> 02:34:29.097]  It stinks to high heaven.
[02:34:29.117 --> 02:34:31.180]  We're going to be talking about that here in just one moment.
[02:34:31.220 --> 02:34:34.564]  But first, I didn't even plug last hour, folks.
[02:34:34.924 --> 02:34:36.586]  You listen to every other show, they plug every 10 minutes.
[02:34:36.606 --> 02:34:38.369]  And I get it, because they can't fund themselves if they don't.
[02:34:39.591 --> 02:34:41.613]  I'm so focused on the news, I don't focus on funding us.
[02:34:42.294 --> 02:34:48.260]  We have the highest quality products, whether it's nutraceuticals, Patriot t-shirts, you name it, you're going to find anywhere.
[02:34:48.680 --> 02:34:50.762]  And your purchase is essential to what we're doing.
[02:34:50.822 --> 02:34:53.505]  It's very expensive to run a media operation like this.
[02:34:54.366 --> 02:35:00.272]  And look, notice how I was working Saturday night, boom, hit them, and now that broke through, the Scalia thing's being looked at now.
[02:35:01.288 --> 02:35:06.032]  And that gives political cover for folks to come out behind me, like police detectives and others.
[02:35:06.613 --> 02:35:07.433]  That's my job.
[02:35:08.154 --> 02:35:09.235]  Hitting barbed wire.
[02:35:10.256 --> 02:35:11.797]  I mean, I am a shock troop.
[02:35:11.857 --> 02:35:12.998]  Make no mistake about it.
[02:35:14.099 --> 02:35:15.300]  And I want to be a shock troop.
[02:35:16.001 --> 02:35:19.364]  I'm just saying, provision us, pray for us, support us.
[02:35:20.751 --> 02:35:21.432]  Buy the products.
[02:35:22.293 --> 02:35:23.153]  They're great products.
[02:35:23.254 --> 02:35:24.795]  All the estrogen mimickers and chemicals.
[02:35:24.935 --> 02:35:26.156]  I mean, this is just all natural.
[02:35:26.216 --> 02:35:27.157]  It's changed my life.
[02:35:27.578 --> 02:35:37.928]  The type of products like Supermental Vitality, Anthroplex, the newest product, the Brain Force, the other amazing products, Secret 12, Winter Sun.
[02:35:37.948 --> 02:35:42.172]  We've got the new Hillary for Prison shirt, another new shirt out that's very popular.
[02:35:42.553 --> 02:35:43.474]  That's a limited edition.
[02:35:45.086 --> 02:35:48.489]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:35:49.230 --> 02:35:55.575]  But Anthroplex is expected to sell out really by tomorrow, except for the few hundred we hold back for those who have signed up for AutoShip.
[02:35:56.155 --> 02:36:00.519]  So now is the time to secure your bottle today before we run out at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:36:00.999 --> 02:36:08.386]  We are being forced to take down the Super Mill and Anthroplex combo special in order to hold back bottles of Anthroplex for AutoShip customers.
[02:36:09.721 --> 02:36:15.484]  But for this week only, you can get Super Male or Super Female Vitality for 20% off at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:36:15.924 --> 02:36:17.645]  Start fighting back and rebuilding your foundation.

[02:36:35.034 --> 02:36:39.296]  We just sell and promote stuff that I like and use, and then we just get you lower prices on it.
[02:36:40.063 --> 02:36:43.486]  Whether it's colloidal silver or lung cleanse or oxy powder.

[02:36:46.609 --> 02:36:48.591]  You see the studios getting built and being bigger.
[02:36:49.011 --> 02:36:51.533]  You see more reporters, more articles, more breaking news.
[02:36:52.054 --> 02:36:56.178]  And every day, every week, we're making international news and hurting the globalists.
[02:36:57.028 --> 02:37:01.350]  I mean, we are in here like vicious pit bulls, savaging the enemy.
[02:37:01.630 --> 02:37:04.391]  And they're hacking us in the head with hatchets and kicking us and shooting at us.
[02:37:04.671 --> 02:37:07.112]  We're just... I mean, we're not backing down.
[02:37:07.152 --> 02:37:07.772]  We're committed.
[02:37:08.032 --> 02:37:08.532]  We love it.
[02:37:08.772 --> 02:37:09.693]  We were born to fight.
[02:37:09.973 --> 02:37:10.673]  We're going in.
[02:37:10.853 --> 02:37:11.513]  We're not stopping.
[02:37:11.533 --> 02:37:12.694]  We're going in through and beyond.
[02:37:12.954 --> 02:37:13.694]  Collision course.
[02:37:13.854 --> 02:37:14.654]  It's never felt better.
[02:37:15.355 --> 02:37:17.676]  That's just... Just don't cry for me, whatever goes down the road.
[02:37:17.916 --> 02:37:19.276]  Just support our info.
[02:37:19.536 --> 02:37:20.417]  Support our crew.

[02:37:25.106 --> 02:37:26.646]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:37:26.926 --> 02:37:28.527]  There's a bunch of other specials as well.
[02:37:29.027 --> 02:37:30.547]  They're just running today.
[02:37:30.687 --> 02:37:32.348]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:37:32.388 --> 02:37:34.829]  Infowarsstore.com is the big umbrella site.
[02:37:36.049 --> 02:37:36.989]  So check it out today.
[02:37:37.049 --> 02:37:41.710]  Finishing up with Wayne Madsen, and then he's going to be linking up with our crew soon, writing articles for Infowars.com.
[02:37:41.750 --> 02:37:47.612]  This is obviously big news on the whole situation with the funeral home.
[02:37:48.292 --> 02:37:51.873]  Wayne, other points, and I'm going to shift gears to David Knight and crew.
[02:37:53.437 --> 02:38:11.884]  Yeah, one other thing I noticed about the funeral home that they took Scalia, it has a side, what they call, if anyone's seen VIPs when they come into a hotel, they usually erect a tent or they go through a tunnel, so you can't really see the person leave the car or enter the car.
[02:38:12.304 --> 02:38:16.606]  Well, this particular funeral home, which was basically recommended
[02:38:17.153 --> 02:38:21.561]  By an unnamed friend of Scalia, a close friend of Scalia.
[02:38:21.601 --> 02:38:28.114]  I don't know if it's the other unnamed, the same unnamed friend who traveled with him from Washington to the ranch.
[02:38:30.682 --> 02:38:48.252]  So the hearse would have pulled in, there was media all over the area, but you would not have been able to see either the casket being removed from the hearse and taken into the funeral home, nor would you have seen who accompanied in the hearse and the SUV Scalia's body.
[02:38:48.332 --> 02:38:53.535]  That might have yielded some information of course about the identities of who was with
[02:38:53.935 --> 02:38:59.739]  And who maybe this unnamed friend of his was who came down from Washington.
[02:38:59.759 --> 02:39:07.244]  Now, I think it's important to note that in the past, Scalia has often traveled to Texas to go whale hunting and dove hunting.
[02:39:07.584 --> 02:39:13.809]  And his hunting partner, who is his very close neighbor, lives very close to him in McLean, Virginia, is Dick Cheney.
[02:39:15.050 --> 02:39:18.592]  Now, Scalia was not, as far as I know, at that ranch where
[02:39:19.181 --> 02:39:21.222]  What do you make out of all this, Wayne?
[02:39:47.492 --> 02:40:01.680]  I'm wondering right now, and I think we also have to focus on this John Poindexter, not the felon from Iran-Contra, a different one, not the retired Navy Admiral, but we should focus on him and just what was going on.
[02:40:03.368 --> 02:40:18.321]  So, Leah, a long three-day weekend because of the President's Day holiday Monday, but it was Valentine's Day on Sunday, and he decides to come down for this, like, the boys are going to get together and go quail hunting, and leaves his wife up in Washington.
[02:40:18.962 --> 02:40:26.789]  The last time I ran into somebody who was not with his wife on Valentine's Day was with the boys, so to speak.
[02:40:27.029 --> 02:40:27.729]  It was back in 06.
[02:40:28.905 --> 02:40:29.365]  I think so.
[02:40:46.110 --> 02:40:47.511]  Very, very interesting.
[02:40:47.691 --> 02:40:55.716]  Now, expanding on this, you're going to be following up some other leads, linking up with the team, and continuing to report over the next few days for us.
[02:40:56.116 --> 02:41:06.082]  So we'll look for that report at Infowars.com on the bodily fluids of the Supreme Court Justice dumped down the drain, basically into the river there in El Paso, Texas.
[02:41:06.742 --> 02:41:10.084]  Wayne Madsen, thank you so much for getting down there so quickly.
[02:41:11.149 --> 02:41:12.130]  Okay, you bet, Alex.
[02:41:12.590 --> 02:41:16.393]  Thank you, and again, if Wayne has more to add, he can pop in in the next hour with due as well.
[02:41:16.413 --> 02:41:21.296]  I know he's got a lot of stuff developing, and the same thing for Richard Reeves, because there is so much unfolding.
[02:41:21.356 --> 02:41:22.597]  Now, we go to Marfa.
[02:41:22.977 --> 02:41:37.647]  It's a lot closer to the ranch, and then obviously they're going to be going towards the ranch, but once you're there, there's no internet, so what happens there will obviously be hard to get out until they get back to a town that has some basic internet, but we have, again, a Skype feed for radio listeners.
[02:41:37.667 --> 02:41:39.949]  You can go to InfoWars.com forward slash Shub.
[02:41:40.649 --> 02:41:41.690]  We'll actually see David Knight.
[02:41:42.251 --> 02:41:45.253]  David Knight is in Marfa with Joe Biggs and of course Josh Owens.
[02:41:45.834 --> 02:41:47.355]  And we appreciate you guys going down there.
[02:41:47.395 --> 02:41:48.697]  No other media is willing to do it.
[02:41:49.698 --> 02:41:52.360]  I know Savage was saying he'd like to see somebody go down there.
[02:41:52.400 --> 02:41:54.082]  So you guys may be popping in with him today.
[02:41:54.822 --> 02:41:58.086]  But you just heard what Wayne Madsen had to say.
[02:41:58.246 --> 02:42:01.209]  I know that you also have gotten an interview with at least one of the judges.
[02:42:01.829 --> 02:42:03.611]  So thank you so much for joining us, David Knight.
[02:42:04.673 --> 02:42:06.054]  David Knight, InfoWars.com.
[02:42:06.074 --> 02:42:07.495]  We're here in Marfa, Texas.
[02:42:07.535 --> 02:42:10.978]  Behind me, the pink building that you see there, is the county building.
[02:42:11.038 --> 02:42:20.765]  We tried to talk to the judge there that pronounced Scalia dead without seeing him, but earlier in the day, we went down to the judge that was called first, Juanita Bishop.
[02:42:21.206 --> 02:42:22.587]  We talked to her and asked her
[02:42:23.539 --> 02:42:25.321]  Why didn't you do it over the phone?
[02:42:25.381 --> 02:42:31.385]  In other words, you know, the obvious thing here, Alex, that everybody is talking about is she said, well, she made a comment.
[02:42:31.566 --> 02:42:34.048]  I would have had an autopsy done.
[02:42:34.068 --> 02:42:34.728]  I would have looked at that.
[02:42:34.968 --> 02:42:36.910]  But of course, she also would have gone.
[02:42:37.640 --> 02:42:43.102]  She got the call first, and she said she was too far away, so she called another judge, who is David Beebe.
[02:42:43.362 --> 02:42:53.805]  He was also too far away, so then they called this third judge, Cinderella Guevara, whose offices are behind us, and she did it all over the phone.
[02:42:53.845 --> 02:42:56.046]  So why wouldn't these other two not do it over the phone?
[02:42:56.066 --> 02:42:58.967]  And of course, the answer to that is that they would
[02:42:59.884 --> 02:43:01.505]  Be more careful about what they're doing.
[02:43:01.665 --> 02:43:05.046]  Alex, we have the presumption of innocence for individuals.
[02:43:05.066 --> 02:43:06.927]  You're presumed innocent until you're proven guilty.
[02:43:06.947 --> 02:43:08.847]  Of course, we've lost that now in America.
[02:43:08.887 --> 02:43:10.288]  We've turned everything upside down.
[02:43:10.788 --> 02:43:15.750]  All individuals are suspect by our government, but our government is never suspected of anything.
[02:43:16.130 --> 02:43:19.851]  And that's what these people who are looking at it, these retired police officers, are saying.
[02:43:20.192 --> 02:43:21.852]  You don't let this go.
[02:43:21.892 --> 02:43:25.393]  You assume that it is a homicide until proven otherwise.
[02:43:25.453 --> 02:43:26.634]  And that's the real issue here.
[02:43:26.974 --> 02:43:30.596]  That's right, and these top police detectives around the country, including D.C.
[02:43:30.616 --> 02:43:39.643]  detectives, you name it, who are over, in some cases, the entire squads, the entire group, are saying, you never do this, because we don't even have names.
[02:43:39.703 --> 02:43:40.984]  It's a phone call at first.
[02:43:41.224 --> 02:43:42.224]  The story changes.
[02:43:42.264 --> 02:43:43.485]  There's a pillow on the head.
[02:43:43.865 --> 02:43:47.888]  And the fact that they act like it's weird that we ask these questions is suspicious.
[02:43:48.168 --> 02:43:53.552]  And the police go on to say, and what's weirder is, the media is not asking questions.
[02:43:53.692 --> 02:43:56.094]  I mean, this thing stinks to high heaven, David Knight.
[02:43:56.872 --> 02:43:59.334]  Well, there's a lot of issues here, Alex, that we're trying to get answers to.
[02:43:59.374 --> 02:44:03.598]  For example, these calls started going, you know, first to Juanita Bishop.
[02:44:03.958 --> 02:44:06.861]  She got the call around 1 o'clock, and then they talked to the other judges.
[02:44:07.181 --> 02:44:09.643]  So from 1 o'clock until 3 a.m.
[02:44:09.663 --> 02:44:13.266]  the next morning, which is 14 hours, they had that amount of time.
[02:44:13.627 --> 02:44:16.769]  By that time, they knew who they were dealing with.
[02:44:17.230 --> 02:44:18.631]  Somebody made the decision.
[02:44:18.971 --> 02:44:25.413]  That even though a Supreme Court Justice died alone, they were not going to do an investigation, they were not going to do an autopsy.
[02:44:25.433 --> 02:44:26.654]  We want to know who did that.
[02:44:26.694 --> 02:44:27.814]  Who was making that decision?
[02:44:28.054 --> 02:44:29.415]  You've got four different individuals.
[02:44:29.475 --> 02:44:31.115]  Oh, but there's no investigation.
[02:44:31.175 --> 02:44:35.557]  The media, the local police won't do it, and that area controlled by the Democrats.
[02:44:37.197 --> 02:44:42.999]  And we've got the photos of this Poindexter character in lovey, you know, squeezies with Obama.
[02:44:43.039 --> 02:44:46.721]  And Obama made a special award, you know, just for him and presented it to him.
[02:44:47.947 --> 02:44:49.067]  This guy's a huge donor.
[02:44:49.308 --> 02:44:50.108]  What do you think is going on here?
[02:44:51.228 --> 02:45:03.973]  Well, the interesting thing is, is that Boindexter, the accounts that we have seen that have been by mainstream media have said that he contacted the federal agencies, said he had a lot of trouble getting a hold of people in federal agencies because it was a Saturday.
[02:45:04.233 --> 02:45:05.714]  But eventually he did get a hold of people.
[02:45:05.734 --> 02:45:08.795]  He said the feds flew in with a helicopter, so forth and so on.
[02:45:09.095 --> 02:45:09.455]  And yet,
[02:45:10.071 --> 02:45:23.843]  We're being told that the decisions about phoning in this death certificate and all the assumptions that were made about this body without ever having seen it were on the basis of a sheriff's deputy talking to Cinderella Guevara.
[02:45:23.923 --> 02:45:25.385]  So we want to know what's going on.
[02:45:25.425 --> 02:45:29.828]  You've got the Cinderella Guevara, you've got the sheriff, you've got the U.S.
[02:45:29.848 --> 02:45:33.271]  Marshals, and then of course you have the family which is also involved in this.
[02:45:33.632 --> 02:45:36.995]  Who made the decision that there wasn't going to be an autopsy
[02:45:37.515 --> 02:45:38.655]  When was that decision made?
[02:45:38.675 --> 02:45:49.019]  They had 14 hours from the time that they started calling the judges until the body arrived in El Paso and that was the point at which the body was embalmed.
[02:45:49.079 --> 02:45:53.060]  And there wasn't even a discussion ever about having an autopsy.
[02:45:53.120 --> 02:45:54.400]  Normally that'd be all over the news.
[02:45:54.760 --> 02:45:54.960]  Yes.
[02:45:55.020 --> 02:45:57.021]  But they'd act weird if you even asked for that.
[02:45:58.066 --> 02:46:03.773]  Well, you know, the amazing thing is, it's always suspicious when a judge at any level gets killed.
[02:46:04.154 --> 02:46:11.063]  Because judges sit in a position where they make decisions that can destroy people's lives.
[02:46:11.143 --> 02:46:13.486]  And so they make a lot of enemies in the course of their work.
[02:46:13.886 --> 02:46:20.851]  But when you've got a Supreme Court Justice, this Supreme Court Justice is deciding the life and death of entire industries.
[02:46:21.131 --> 02:46:24.233]  He's deciding the life and death of global agendas.
[02:46:24.414 --> 02:46:24.914]  Exactly.
[02:46:25.274 --> 02:46:28.777]  And as a matter of fact, he just had a decision like that a few days before he died.
[02:46:28.797 --> 02:46:31.038]  And he said, no, we're not shutting down all the carbon plants.
[02:46:31.458 --> 02:46:33.540]  No, we're going to defend the Second Amendment.
[02:46:33.620 --> 02:46:34.721]  No, we're going to control the border.
[02:46:35.061 --> 02:46:36.782]  No, we're not going to let the TPP run everything.
[02:46:36.822 --> 02:46:37.443]  And they went, oh really?
[02:46:37.463 --> 02:46:37.783]  You're dead.
[02:46:38.737 --> 02:46:39.837]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:46:40.198 --> 02:46:41.558]  That is what is very suspicious.
[02:46:41.878 --> 02:46:56.023]  Because you've got him being involved in something that is not only shutting the coal industry down, but that decision that they made to put a stay on Obama's EPA orders to take down the coal industry also had massive impacts on their whole climate change agenda.
[02:46:56.103 --> 02:47:00.265]  So that decision wasn't just of national importance, it was of international importance.
[02:47:00.305 --> 02:47:07.515]  And the globalists, according to the Financial Times of London, have spent more than $60 billion the last 20 years pushing the global warming carbon tax bull.
[02:47:07.976 --> 02:47:09.398]  And he just shot it down.
[02:47:09.738 --> 02:47:14.806]  And so maybe it's just a message to the rest of the court, you do what you're told, or you're going to end up with a pillow over your head.
[02:47:15.962 --> 02:47:25.206]  All of that is a factor, and that is, all of those are reasons why we shouldn't just wave our hands and say, move along, there's nothing to see here, I'm sure this is all innocent.
[02:47:25.746 --> 02:47:30.808]  Yeah, he went to a doctor, the doctor did a MRI because he was complaining about a shoulder pain.
[02:47:31.468 --> 02:47:36.470]  That and the fact that he's 79 years old doesn't mean that it is necessarily natural causes.
[02:47:36.510 --> 02:47:37.510]  That's what we want to ask them.
[02:47:37.550 --> 02:47:39.551]  What made you think it was natural causes?
[02:47:39.651 --> 02:47:43.333]  Why would you dismiss... I went to a doctor a few months ago for my shoulders.
[02:47:43.353 --> 02:47:44.353]  Does that mean I'm going to drop dead?
[02:47:45.103 --> 02:47:51.298]  And of course he wasn't feeling bad enough that he wouldn't make a trip all the way out here to this remote area to go quail hunting.
[02:47:51.759 --> 02:47:54.245]  So he obviously was not in that bad a condition.
[02:47:55.905 --> 02:48:16.854]  Look, I don't want to just sit here and say it looked like they killed him, but I mean, the way it just instantly came out, nothing happened, go to sleep, and then there'll be no autopsy, and then the story changed, he had a heart attack, didn't have a heart attack, somebody called me on the phone and said it was a heart attack, then it wasn't a heart attack, I mean, can this judge, can she, like, fix airplane equipment without a degree?
[02:48:16.894 --> 02:48:18.074]  Can she be a rocket scientist?
[02:48:18.434 --> 02:48:18.875]  A doctor?
[02:48:18.895 --> 02:48:21.456]  I mean, are we going to have her run nuclear reactors now?
[02:48:22.696 --> 02:48:24.237]  She's a judge, she's not a doctor.
[02:48:25.165 --> 02:48:25.585]  That's right.
[02:48:25.645 --> 02:48:27.067]  And that's why there should have been a case.
[02:48:27.407 --> 02:48:42.100]  That's why you've got people who are retired from the District of Columbia as well as from New York City who were head of criminal divisions saying this is absolutely outrageous that a person of this stature would not have a full investigation.
[02:48:42.360 --> 02:48:45.262]  You don't come in and say there's a pronouncement of innocence here.
[02:48:45.282 --> 02:48:46.704]  I'm sure there's nothing going on here.
[02:48:46.744 --> 02:48:47.905]  That is absolutely
[02:48:48.405 --> 02:48:50.247]  That's the red flag.
[02:48:50.327 --> 02:48:51.448]  It's saying, don't look here.
[02:48:51.688 --> 02:48:59.155]  It's like if a cop pulls you over and you say, I'm not drinking or there's not marijuana in here or I promise I wasn't part of the bank robbery.
[02:48:59.315 --> 02:49:00.736]  They're like, get out of the car, get out of the car.
[02:49:00.756 --> 02:49:03.078]  I mean, it's ridiculously obvious.
[02:49:03.158 --> 02:49:03.438]  It's like...
[02:49:04.119 --> 02:49:07.722]  You know, throwing something in a trunk and slamming it when you see the cops are running and racing away.
[02:49:07.802 --> 02:49:10.365]  I mean, it is just so suspicious.
[02:49:11.025 --> 02:49:11.986]  The whole way.
[02:49:12.346 --> 02:49:12.927]  I mean, man.
[02:49:13.147 --> 02:49:20.213]  And then this guy was in, like, secret black ops in Vietnam and is involved in all these big CIA-connected brokerage firms.
[02:49:20.253 --> 02:49:21.074]  I mean, key ones.
[02:49:21.474 --> 02:49:21.854]  Key.
[02:49:22.615 --> 02:49:24.737]  Key groups are getting awards from Obama.
[02:49:25.177 --> 02:49:26.779]  I mean, oh boy, I tell you.
[02:49:27.762 --> 02:49:30.443]  This is a very elite ranch, obviously.
[02:49:30.483 --> 02:49:32.484]  That's why Scalia and other celebrities are there.
[02:49:33.644 --> 02:49:38.586]  30,000 acres he has here, so yeah, he's got a lot of connections, a lot of money involved there.
[02:49:39.046 --> 02:49:44.087]  But the thing that we all need to look at, and we all need to ask questions about, how did this happen?
[02:49:44.147 --> 02:49:45.568]  How could something like this happen?
[02:49:46.048 --> 02:49:50.869]  The federal agents were involved long before the decision was made not to do an autopsy.
[02:49:51.089 --> 02:49:53.329]  Even if you've got gross incompetence... That's right.
[02:49:53.349 --> 02:49:54.029]  They were involved.
[02:49:54.089 --> 02:49:58.890]  It's federal jurisdiction because he's a federal officer and... I mean, this is ridiculous.
[02:49:59.470 --> 02:49:59.830]  That's right.
[02:49:59.870 --> 02:50:06.472]  The federal agency had 14 hours before he even got to El Paso where they eventually did an embalming there.
[02:50:06.612 --> 02:50:13.073]  And Obama knew within two hours of his body being found, but the whole country didn't know until way later.
[02:50:13.133 --> 02:50:13.653]  I mean, come on.
[02:50:14.437 --> 02:50:15.937]  Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.
[02:50:16.337 --> 02:50:24.359]  And so you can look at this and you can say, okay, there's been issues with this judge in the past shutting down what people thought might have been a murder investigation.
[02:50:24.699 --> 02:50:25.999]  They say, move along, there's nothing here.
[02:50:26.239 --> 02:50:31.320]  You could talk about local incompetence, but the federal agents knew who they were dealing with.
[02:50:31.480 --> 02:50:31.700]  Sure.
[02:50:31.720 --> 02:50:33.301]  They should have shut this thing down.
[02:50:33.321 --> 02:50:34.981]  Well, let me say something about that area, okay?
[02:50:35.041 --> 02:50:36.381]  I mean, it is wild, wild west, folks.
[02:50:36.401 --> 02:50:37.541]  You want to see what the old west looked like?
[02:50:37.962 --> 02:50:39.102]  Get down to those areas.
[02:50:39.142 --> 02:50:39.762]  I mean, it's real.
[02:50:40.242 --> 02:50:42.063]  There's a lot of folks down there who want to be left alone.
[02:50:42.563 --> 02:50:45.185]  The drugs coming across the border is sensational.
[02:50:45.745 --> 02:50:52.949]  And let me just tell you point blank, if you ask me who are the most corrupt judiciary in Texas, I would say Southwest Texas on the border.

[02:55:18.409 --> 02:55:22.870]  Going back to Marfa, Texas, just about an hour away from the ranch where they're going next.
[02:55:23.370 --> 02:55:24.891]  And again, pray for them, folks, because
[02:55:25.942 --> 02:55:30.484]  Who knows what hanky panky will take place with the local police and the situation.
[02:55:30.504 --> 02:55:36.507]  If you leave Marfa and start getting to the other area, I was just talking to Nico who's got family down there, he won't even go down there.
[02:55:37.047 --> 02:55:40.488]  I mean, it is, it is, it is creepy down there.
[02:55:40.608 --> 02:55:41.689]  And very dangerous.
[02:55:42.189 --> 02:55:46.631]  I mean, this is one of the most dangerous areas on the Mexican border where this ranch is on the other side.
[02:55:47.552 --> 02:55:50.413]  Voodoo, santeria, you know.
[02:55:50.993 --> 02:56:00.237]  Crazy stuff, but I'm telling you, it's not just the Hispanic culture down there that's particularly dangerous, it's the white people that are around there too.
[02:56:00.277 --> 02:56:01.618]  You don't see any black people down there.
[02:56:02.465 --> 02:56:10.911]  Uh, and it is like in the middle, I mean, I like to go down by Big Ben because it's so beautiful, and Terilingua because it's so old-fashioned and western, but it's even a little scary and seedy.
[02:56:11.191 --> 02:56:13.753]  But you start going over a little bit, it is, it is crazy.
[02:56:14.273 --> 02:56:16.154]  Uh, so they are pretty close to the ranch now.
[02:56:16.534 --> 02:56:19.236]  Joining us is Kit Daniels and Joe Biggs is coming up the next segment.
[02:56:19.836 --> 02:56:21.898]  Uh, Kit Daniels, what are your observations?
[02:56:22.708 --> 02:56:32.571]  Yeah, me and David Knight, we talked to the Justice of the Peace Juanita Bishop, and one of the things I asked her was, do you normally perform autopsies in this county when someone, you find a dead body?
[02:56:33.191 --> 02:56:44.975]  And what she said, I'm paraphrasing here, they usually, we usually request an autopsy to protect the county, especially if the deceased was not with the physician or under medical care, because they don't know the cause of death for sure.
[02:56:44.995 --> 02:56:45.615]  That's right.
[02:56:45.655 --> 02:56:51.477]  I mean, if a doctor says we think the person died of this, they may not do an autopsy, but you're found dead at your house, they almost always do, especially if it's a public figure.
[02:56:52.305 --> 02:57:08.520]  And in my view, he wasn't under the medical care because yes, he had a doctor that claimed, told the judge, uh, uh, that he had been sick for the past couple of days, but yet all of a sudden he clears him to go on this hunting trip, you know, out of the state.
[02:57:08.540 --> 02:57:09.400]  Well, here's the key.
[02:57:09.901 --> 02:57:10.982]  We need to get this out.
[02:57:11.022 --> 02:57:16.006]  The point that the original judge said they would normally do an autopsy in this case.
[02:57:16.046 --> 02:57:18.889]  And I know you guys haven't had time to upload that yet, but we do have that on video.
[02:57:19.761 --> 02:57:22.984]  I got it on audio, so we got a good audio on that.
[02:57:23.024 --> 02:57:23.484]  Well, good job.
[02:57:23.524 --> 02:57:26.546]  I know it's hard to get into the courthouse and talk to a judge, so I'm impressed you guys got that.
[02:57:27.247 --> 02:57:42.119]  Yeah, and continuing, she said that they normally request an autopsy if they don't know the cause of death, and Bishop, she told me personally that she usually goes out to see the body because, quote, it's my job.
[02:57:42.499 --> 02:57:43.640]  So she didn't do her job this time?
[02:57:44.363 --> 02:57:48.946]  Well, she said she told us she was out of town or she's on a work-related event or something like that.
[02:57:49.346 --> 02:57:54.029]  So she called the other, I believe the other justice of the peace, and for some reason he couldn't show up either.
[02:57:54.509 --> 02:58:00.653]  So they end up calling the county judge, Gabe Barra, and she ended up being the one that phoned it in.
[02:58:00.753 --> 02:58:06.697]  But according to the Texas Code, Article 4904, deaths requiring an inquest,
[02:58:07.426 --> 02:58:15.949]  The Justice of the Peace shall conduct an inquest into the death of a person who dies in the county served by the Justice, if it has multiple aligning items.
[02:58:16.029 --> 02:58:20.951]  One of them is, the person dies an unnatural death from a cause other than a legal execution.
[02:58:21.411 --> 02:58:23.732]  The body or a body part of a person is found.
[02:58:23.752 --> 02:58:25.993]  The cause of circumstances of death are unknown.
[02:58:26.073 --> 02:58:26.473]  There it is!
[02:58:26.493 --> 02:58:27.373]  Yeah.
[02:58:27.673 --> 02:58:28.834]  Texas Code was violated.
[02:58:29.334 --> 02:58:29.634]  Headline.
[02:58:29.654 --> 02:58:29.754]  Yeah.
[02:58:31.024 --> 02:58:37.627]  Yeah, the person was, uh, it goes on, uh, the person, even if the person was identified or unidentified, you know, the same thing applies.
[02:58:38.587 --> 02:58:39.368]  Yeah, this is big.
[02:58:39.428 --> 02:58:41.528]  I want to get you and Biggs on camera right now together.
[02:58:41.548 --> 02:58:43.409]  I want you to finish, then get some comments from Biggs.
[02:58:43.689 --> 02:58:47.791]  But I think you guys should continue on into the next hour with, with Rob Doo coming up.
[02:58:47.831 --> 02:58:52.053]  So this is real journalism on the ground, and you're seeing what we're digging into here.
[02:58:52.073 --> 02:58:53.974]  No other media will dare do it.
[02:58:54.154 --> 02:58:55.114]  The police agree with us.
[02:58:55.494 --> 02:58:56.955]  The police across the country agree with us.
[02:58:58.308 --> 02:59:01.991]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male and then when super female came out.
[02:59:02.051 --> 02:59:02.592]  Tell us what happened.
[02:59:02.952 --> 02:59:07.556]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[02:59:07.716 --> 02:59:08.757]  Talk about the effects.
[02:59:09.057 --> 02:59:10.538]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[02:59:10.558 --> 02:59:12.180]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[02:59:12.480 --> 02:59:13.541]  I feel like I look better.
[02:59:13.601 --> 02:59:14.241]  I feel better.
[02:59:14.301 --> 02:59:15.382]  I feel sexier.
[02:59:15.703 --> 02:59:16.083]  I love it.
[02:59:16.323 --> 02:59:19.224]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.

[03:00:19.941 --> 03:00:21.381]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:21.621 --> 03:00:22.442]  Oh, it's so beautiful.
[03:00:22.462 --> 03:00:24.983]  Let's just play a little bit of this, because I get depressed hearing all this news.
[03:00:25.083 --> 03:00:26.483]  Let's have a little bit of light.
[03:00:26.523 --> 03:00:28.924]  Boys, tell how Pancho fell.
[03:00:29.965 --> 03:00:32.766]  He left his living in cheap hotel.
[03:00:33.827 --> 03:00:36.668]  The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold.
[03:00:37.708 --> 03:00:40.509]  And so the story ends, we're told.
[03:00:41.710 --> 03:00:44.131]  Pancho needs your prayers, it's true.
[03:00:45.441 --> 03:00:48.023]  But save a few for a lefty too.
[03:00:49.343 --> 03:00:52.325]  He only did what he had to do.
[03:00:53.146 --> 03:00:54.947]  And now, he's grown old.
[03:00:56.127 --> 03:00:58.129]  And, uh, who thinks I'm gonna grow old?
[03:00:58.229 --> 03:01:05.373]  The Globalists hope there aren't any men left in the world.
[03:01:06.614 --> 03:01:09.656]  They hope we're a bunch of children they can direct around.
[03:01:10.256 --> 03:01:12.157]  Well, they're gonna find out.
[03:01:14.656 --> 03:01:17.656]  Just like every other group of tyrants in history, they're gonna burn!
[03:01:19.056 --> 03:01:21.037]  Now, Kit Daniels is going to be with us.
[03:01:21.137 --> 03:01:28.260]  I want to get Joe Biggs' take and David Knight's take again in the next two segments, then Dew's got a big broadcast lined up with a ton of other news.
[03:01:29.220 --> 03:01:31.281]  But I tell you, this is just crazy.
[03:01:32.202 --> 03:01:33.782]  Absolutely crazy right now.
[03:01:34.143 --> 03:01:40.665]  And I want Kit Daniels to come back after the next segment, repeat what he just said, and then have David come back, and then Joe Biggs.
[03:01:40.706 --> 03:01:42.286]  In fact, Joe Biggs next, and then David.
[03:01:42.846 --> 03:01:45.848]  But I've got to tell you, great job, Kit, as an investigative journalist.
[03:01:46.508 --> 03:01:47.509]  Doing what nobody else does.
[03:01:47.609 --> 03:01:49.050]  Showing how they violated the code.
[03:01:49.871 --> 03:01:54.855]  David showing how the feds were really in control but claim it was locals and all this confusion.
[03:01:55.155 --> 03:02:04.984]  It's either the biggest lazy group of people across the board or foul play and then they say there's a pillow over his face and it's the whole thing breaks down.
[03:02:05.364 --> 03:02:13.591]  So give me your take on what you thought when you first saw it versus now that you're close to it and have talked to the judge and more and where you think this is going, Kit Daniels.
[03:02:14.261 --> 03:02:18.223]  Well Alex, having told you the bombshell yet, as far as the Penal Code, it goes further.
[03:02:18.864 --> 03:02:27.729]  Quote, on number four, if the circumstances of the death indicate that the death may have been caused by unlawful means, i.e.
[03:02:27.769 --> 03:02:35.433]  you find a dead body with a pillow over its head, then yes, according to Texas law, the justice of peace shall require an autopsy.
[03:02:37.254 --> 03:02:38.735]  And if the person dies while
[03:02:40.217 --> 03:02:45.500]  While attended by a physician who is unable to certify the cause of death or request the justice of the peace conducting inquest.
[03:02:45.520 --> 03:02:46.540]  So it goes on further than that.
[03:02:46.600 --> 03:02:46.981]  That's right.
[03:02:47.081 --> 03:02:47.421]  That's right.
[03:02:48.001 --> 03:02:52.864]  It's gotta be the doctor on call at the hospital with the charts who will certify it.
[03:02:53.922 --> 03:03:01.188]  Because I've seen family die that was in a hospital for a month, and they know why, and they don't have to do an autopsy, and they ask the family, and they say, yeah, we don't want one.
[03:03:01.428 --> 03:03:02.949]  They say, good, I certify it as well.
[03:03:03.229 --> 03:03:11.255]  But you don't have the Supreme Court Justice, the key one, dead with a bunch of conflicting stories, and then they don't at least investigate an autopsy.
[03:03:12.096 --> 03:03:13.197]  I'm sorry, this is crazy.
[03:03:13.297 --> 03:03:15.018]  They did not want an autopsy, brother.
[03:03:16.139 --> 03:03:21.143]  Yeah, I mean, going back to your question before about what my views is now compared to when the story broke.
[03:03:21.886 --> 03:03:26.754]  I mean, this is, at the very bare minimum, this is gross negligence and incompetence by these local officials.
[03:03:27.575 --> 03:03:31.922]  I mean, you have a county judge that's all of a sudden now a medical doctor apparently.
[03:03:32.495 --> 03:03:43.426]  You know, causing a... by over the phone, I guess telepathically, that she can decide how this person died, that she had any... I don't even think she knew where the body was or anything.
[03:03:43.466 --> 03:03:43.866]  She might have.
[03:03:43.886 --> 03:03:47.490]  That's one of the questions we wanted to ask her, but of course she doesn't take questions right now.
[03:03:47.950 --> 03:03:54.917]  You've got top deputies, you've got top heads of homicide quotes saying, I almost fell out of my chair.
[03:03:55.497 --> 03:03:56.258]  Another one says,
[03:03:57.219 --> 03:03:58.320]  I was dumbfounded.
[03:03:58.340 --> 03:04:00.120]  Another one says I was completely shocked.
[03:04:00.160 --> 03:04:02.401]  I mean, how obvious does this have to get?
[03:04:02.762 --> 03:04:04.062]  I fell out of my chair, too!
[03:04:06.143 --> 03:04:15.127]  Yeah, it's, I mean, if this was, like I said on the show the other day, if he was targeted for assassination, this would be the county to do it in.
[03:04:15.187 --> 03:04:22.030]  This would be the exact circumstance that they would need to pull out an exact, not only a successful assassination, but a successful cover-up.
[03:04:24.246 --> 03:04:26.267]  Well, I'd rather die than submit to this scum.
[03:04:26.307 --> 03:04:27.188]  I've had enough of their crap.
[03:04:27.208 --> 03:04:27.888]  What about you, Kit?
[03:04:28.508 --> 03:04:29.249]  Yeah, me too.
[03:04:29.969 --> 03:04:31.990]  Well, I want to reset, because I was hyperventilating.
[03:04:32.010 --> 03:04:40.375]  I want to come back, Rob Dew, give you the floor, and I want you to go back over that penal code again for folks, talk about it, what the judges said.
[03:04:40.435 --> 03:04:47.279]  I want to hand the baton to Joe Biggs, and then back for a comment with Knight, with Rob Dew quarterbacking this thing straight ahead.
[03:04:47.299 --> 03:04:53.002]  I'm going to punch out and take care of business operations, defending us from enemy operations, literally.
[03:04:53.522 --> 03:04:54.803]  I'm gonna deal with that, as usual.
[03:04:55.023 --> 03:04:57.444]  Believe me, they don't just leave us alone here while we're doing this.
[03:04:57.784 --> 03:04:58.465]  So stay with us.
[03:04:58.565 --> 03:04:59.385]  It's all coming up.
[03:04:59.465 --> 03:05:00.526]  And support us.
[03:05:00.826 --> 03:05:01.546]  Spread the word.
[03:05:01.947 --> 03:05:02.667]  Buy the products.
[03:05:02.787 --> 03:05:03.548]  And pray for us.
[03:05:03.888 --> 03:05:05.008]  But spread the word, folks.
[03:05:05.188 --> 03:05:06.149]  You are the key.
[03:05:06.409 --> 03:05:07.450]  You are the resistance.
[03:05:09.417 --> 03:05:20.685]  We have previously seen 3D printing technology bring us things like simple household items, more advanced components of firearms, and now it's being reported that they can even produce body parts.
[03:05:21.185 --> 03:05:33.293]  A team at Wake Forest University has used a combination of living cells and a special gel to print out human body parts, including ears, muscles, and jaw bones, reports NBC News.
[03:05:33.633 --> 03:05:44.823]  It's an advance on previous attempts, which either involved making a plastic scaffold and then trying to get cells to grow in and on it, or that printed out organ shapes that ended up being too floppy and dying.
[03:05:45.103 --> 03:05:52.349]  The new approach mixes live cells with a gel that starts out as liquid but quickly hardens to the consistency of living tissue.
[03:05:52.629 --> 03:05:55.352]  The challenge of making living tissue is complicated.
[03:05:55.732 --> 03:06:01.777]  Even a simple structure like an ear has several types of cells and they must all be fed by tiny capillaries.
[03:06:02.297 --> 03:06:05.599]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com
[03:06:09.552 --> 03:06:12.974]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:06:13.335 --> 03:06:20.479]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:06:21.060 --> 03:06:29.465]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:06:29.686 --> 03:06:33.848]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:06:34.089 --> 03:06:38.872]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics, the destroyer of
[03:06:39.692 --> 03:06:43.495]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:06:43.915 --> 03:06:46.998]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[03:06:47.338 --> 03:06:58.446]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[03:06:58.486 --> 03:07:01.168]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[03:07:01.388 --> 03:07:07.353]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[03:07:07.993 --> 03:07:09.955]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[03:07:10.035 --> 03:07:11.076]  Try a bottle of it.
[03:07:11.276 --> 03:07:12.717]  Rob Dew joins us.
[03:07:12.857 --> 03:07:15.680]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[03:07:15.960 --> 03:07:17.021]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[03:07:17.041 --> 03:07:17.982]  I've been working all day.
[03:07:18.002 --> 03:07:20.364]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[03:07:20.504 --> 03:07:21.504]  I get in here at 830.
[03:07:21.925 --> 03:07:23.546]  I was kind of run down.
[03:07:23.826 --> 03:07:25.548]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[03:07:25.748 --> 03:07:27.610]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[03:07:27.630 --> 03:07:29.452]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[03:07:29.472 --> 03:07:30.232]  I popped two of them.
[03:07:30.533 --> 03:07:32.675]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[03:07:32.815 --> 03:07:34.597]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[03:07:34.617 --> 03:07:36.058]  It's got four and a half stars.
[03:07:36.258 --> 03:07:37.279]  People really love it.
[03:07:37.599 --> 03:07:38.120]  Read about it.
[03:07:38.200 --> 03:07:41.944]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[03:07:42.024 --> 03:07:47.309]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[03:07:47.489 --> 03:07:51.374]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[03:07:51.554 --> 03:07:57.321]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[03:07:57.681 --> 03:08:03.588]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:08:21.960 --> 03:08:22.721]  Big Brother.
[03:08:23.101 --> 03:08:24.323]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:24.884 --> 03:08:25.925]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:26.806 --> 03:08:28.208]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:08:28.488 --> 03:08:29.569]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:30.150 --> 03:08:34.835]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:39.093 --> 03:08:40.754]  Alright, we are live in the fourth hour.
[03:08:40.794 --> 03:08:43.657]  This is Rob Dew hosting Fourth Hour of Overdrive.
[03:08:43.817 --> 03:08:48.661]  If your station is not picking it up, please give them a call and say, hey, Alex Jones is on for four hours now.
[03:08:49.221 --> 03:08:52.984]  And you can also watch it at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:08:54.345 --> 03:09:01.788]  And Alex was in the last break, or in the last segment there, he was talking with Kit Daniels going over, I guess, the broken Texas penal code.
[03:09:01.808 --> 03:09:08.891]  They just, the judge didn't want to get out of bed, it was late or early in the morning, didn't feel like driving down to the area where
[03:09:09.931 --> 03:09:12.772]  The Supreme Court Justice is found dead in a hunting lodge.
[03:09:13.233 --> 03:09:15.113]  A really nice hunting lodge, essentially.
[03:09:15.874 --> 03:09:18.555]  And, you know, just, eh, whatever.
[03:09:18.595 --> 03:09:20.356]  We'll send a hearse to come pick him up.
[03:09:20.376 --> 03:09:21.436]  We'll drive him to El Paso.
[03:09:21.456 --> 03:09:22.196]  We're going to embalm him.
[03:09:22.216 --> 03:09:27.779]  We're not going to do any looking at his body in any way, shape, or form, you know, because
[03:09:28.499 --> 03:09:31.381]  You know, he's found the pillow over his face, so obviously he died of natural causes.
[03:09:31.942 --> 03:09:43.031]  So going back to Kit Daniels, by the way, we have five reporters in West Texas and that's all thanks to you out there for supporting us at InfoWars.com, forward slash show, go on InfoWarsStore.com, become a member of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:09:43.071 --> 03:09:44.792]  It's all those little ways that you can help us.
[03:09:44.832 --> 03:09:51.337]  Also spreading the word about the broadcast so more people pick it up, more people get interested, more people click on the links, more people watch the YouTube videos.
[03:09:51.638 --> 03:09:55.120]  It's all because of you that we have five reporters down there now.
[03:09:56.281 --> 03:10:01.587]  On the ground digging into this, which is probably the biggest story of 2016 thus far.
[03:10:02.448 --> 03:10:03.569]  The biggest story right now.
[03:10:03.930 --> 03:10:07.053]  A dead Supreme Court Justice dies with a pillow over his head.
[03:10:07.574 --> 03:10:09.836]  It's natural causes, nothing to see, everybody turn around.
[03:10:09.856 --> 03:10:12.459]  But let's look at the headlines on Drudge right here.
[03:10:13.180 --> 03:10:15.944]  Detectives question lack of autopsy in Scalia death.
[03:10:15.984 --> 03:10:18.348]  Took a look at report and almost fell out of chair.
[03:10:19.109 --> 03:10:20.130]  Savage, was he murdered?
[03:10:20.231 --> 03:10:21.312]  Trump, pretty unusual.
[03:10:21.673 --> 03:10:23.535]  Will Texas governor call for investigation?
[03:10:23.656 --> 03:10:25.498]  Conspiracy theories swirl.
[03:10:25.518 --> 03:10:27.962]  Will lie in repose at Supreme Court.
[03:10:28.763 --> 03:10:31.304]  Death boosts legal chances for Obama's climate scheme.
[03:10:31.944 --> 03:10:42.849]  Also, there's some abortion cases that he was actively working on and that were upcoming, which are now going to be, it looks like a 4-4 tie in the Supreme Court.
[03:10:42.889 --> 03:10:47.671]  Scalia was usually the fifth man who was a conservative.
[03:10:48.091 --> 03:10:50.873]  So, without further ado, let's go back to Kit Daniels in Marfa, Texas.
[03:10:50.933 --> 03:10:58.276]  Kit, read off that penal code again for those who are just tuning in to what law the judge looks like officially breaking at this point.
[03:10:59.093 --> 03:11:04.817]  Yes, this is Texas Code Article 49.04, deaths requiring an inquest.
[03:11:05.417 --> 03:11:24.109]  A justice of the peace shall conduct an inquest into the death of a person who dies in the county served by the justice, if, there are several line items, one of which is, the body or a body part of a person is found, the cause and circumstances of death are unknown, regardless of whether the person was identified or not identified,
[03:11:24.924 --> 03:11:29.566]  Uh, the circumstances of the death indicated that the death may have been caused by unlawful means.
[03:11:29.626 --> 03:11:40.772]  You know, like I told Alex before the break, you know, if you find a dead body with a pillow over its head, I would suggest that, yes, that's probably a likely on, uh, natural death, to put it mildly.
[03:11:40.792 --> 03:11:44.194]  Uh, the person dies without having been attended by a physician.
[03:11:44.214 --> 03:11:48.836]  Uh, as far as I know, Scalia, he did not have a physician present with him at the ranch.
[03:11:49.728 --> 03:11:53.111]  And the person dies while attended by a physician who's unable to satisfy blah blah blah.
[03:11:53.131 --> 03:11:54.872]  I don't think that really applies in this case.
[03:11:55.452 --> 03:12:08.622]  But there's at least, I'd say, one, two, three line items in this code that I think would call for the justice of the peace to require an autopsy, especially for a Supreme Court justice that served our nation for over 30 years.
[03:12:09.690 --> 03:12:10.591]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:12:11.051 --> 03:12:15.534]  And so she made the call not to do an autopsy.
[03:12:16.154 --> 03:12:17.595]  And then who made the call?
[03:12:17.615 --> 03:12:20.937]  Do we know who made the call to immediately embalm the justice?
[03:12:21.097 --> 03:12:24.259]  The one we talked to in the morning was Juanita Bishop.
[03:12:24.299 --> 03:12:26.080]  She was the justice of the Peace Precinct 2.
[03:12:26.120 --> 03:12:30.203]  She was the one, I think she wrote the article saying that I would have called an autopsy if it was me.
[03:12:30.823 --> 03:12:32.964]  So we went to her office and we're like, well, why didn't you?
[03:12:33.004 --> 03:12:33.725]  What happened?
[03:12:34.560 --> 03:12:38.884]  And apparently she said she was out of town on some work-related event or something like that, you know, who knows?
[03:12:39.204 --> 03:12:41.626]  It's President's Day, everybody's got the long weekend.
[03:12:41.646 --> 03:12:42.267]  Yeah, right.
[03:12:43.167 --> 03:12:44.649]  Those who sponge off the government.
[03:12:45.269 --> 03:12:50.413]  So she called the, I believe she called the second justice of the peace, and for some reason he also couldn't show up to it.
[03:12:50.894 --> 03:12:57.219]  So they called the county judge, and the county judge doesn't even bother with the inquest code, apparently.
[03:12:57.399 --> 03:13:02.804]  She just calls it in saying, hey, this is a dead body, you know, it died of natural causes without ever having seen the body.
[03:13:04.045 --> 03:13:12.228]  And to me it's really weird because the ranch, you know, you had Mick Jagger, Julia Roberts, all these celebrities that visited this ranch.
[03:13:12.628 --> 03:13:20.090]  So this wasn't like an illegal alien that was found dead in a pasture that was mingled up, you know, wasn't much left.
[03:13:20.950 --> 03:13:30.093]  This was somebody who was more than likely of predominance because he was at the ranch that is frequented by celebrities and that's a well-known fact here in Marfa.
[03:13:31.209 --> 03:13:36.893]  Yeah, and I'm showing right now on the overhead cam, Obama, Poindexter picks fuel, Scalia suspicions.
[03:13:36.913 --> 03:13:38.214]  This is out of WorldNetDaily.
[03:13:38.254 --> 03:13:40.256]  We have it posted at Infowars.com.
[03:13:41.077 --> 03:13:52.305]  A couple of photographs of President Obama shaking hands with a wealthy Democrat Party donor named John Poindexter, who also owns the ranch resort where he found Supreme Court Justice Anton Scalia dead, also with a pillow over his head.
[03:13:52.365 --> 03:13:53.506]  They don't mention that.
[03:13:53.926 --> 03:13:59.310]  But Michael Savage just gave wings with the blunt broadcast question, was he murdered?
[03:14:00.262 --> 03:14:01.244]  As Savage would say.
[03:14:01.264 --> 03:14:08.158]  So there you go, this guy obviously has ties to Obama right here, a Democratic donor.
[03:14:09.437 --> 03:14:14.001]  He was getting, I think he was getting awards from Obama for Vietnam military service.
[03:14:14.962 --> 03:14:16.964]  And really, really suspicious.
[03:14:17.004 --> 03:14:19.887]  I guess you guys are going to be looking to get an interview with John Poindexter.
[03:14:19.907 --> 03:14:25.372]  And I tell you, if he doesn't agree to an interview, an on-camera interview, then there's something really fishy.
[03:14:25.633 --> 03:14:28.996]  Because if they have nothing to hide, then they should just be all out in the open and it should be easy.
[03:14:29.036 --> 03:14:30.998]  Hey, whatever questions you want to ask, we'll answer them.
[03:14:31.378 --> 03:14:31.819]  Don't you agree?
[03:14:32.660 --> 03:14:42.388]  Absolutely and I mean at the very least we know we do know right now the county officials are acting very unusual about this whole case and they're going out of their norms not to call for an autopsy.
[03:14:43.009 --> 03:14:47.333]  I mean it's just like what Bishop told me it's like they normally call an autopsy to cover the counties but
[03:14:48.560 --> 03:14:51.382]  But in the case of a Supreme Court Justice, we just don't do it.
[03:14:51.522 --> 03:14:54.484]  You know, we have a report, John Bowne's digging it up tonight.
[03:14:54.544 --> 03:14:55.865]  Darren McBreen reminded me of this.
[03:14:56.266 --> 03:14:58.187]  They were talking to people and got furious.
[03:14:58.487 --> 03:15:01.910]  And every time they find a dead illegal alien, they do an autopsy.
[03:15:02.350 --> 03:15:02.910]  It's just normal.
[03:15:04.309 --> 03:15:07.172]  Yeah, I remember I worked with Bowne on that.
[03:15:07.192 --> 03:15:11.117]  I think I did the article, he did the video, when he went down to interview that judge in Power Free Area.
[03:15:11.137 --> 03:15:12.138]  So I told McBreen about that.
[03:15:12.158 --> 03:15:21.810]  Because I remember that the judge, the county was going bankrupt because they were having to do all these autopsies around the county for all these illegals they were founding and pastors that were dead.
[03:15:22.330 --> 03:15:26.873]  So you're telling me that you can call for an autopsy at taxpayer's expense for an illegal alien?
[03:15:27.374 --> 03:15:29.955]  You can't call for an autopsy on a Supreme Court justice?
[03:15:30.256 --> 03:15:33.398]  Just as a precaution, you know, and who knows what he was found.
[03:15:33.418 --> 03:15:40.542]  I had some conversations with Wayne Mattson about what he was speculating, but he's doing some more digging into this Poindexter fellow.
[03:15:41.643 --> 03:15:43.984]  And, you know, but he said there's some big parties out there.
[03:15:44.425 --> 03:15:48.667]  Big time parties, Tommy Lee Jones, Mick Jagger, you name it, people are out there having a good time.
[03:15:49.367 --> 03:15:51.628]  And, you know, rock stars know how to party.
[03:15:51.789 --> 03:15:52.349]  I'll tell you that.
[03:15:52.409 --> 03:15:54.730]  Rock stars and actors definitely know how to party.
[03:15:55.591 --> 03:16:06.636]  At the very least, that would be a huge red flag for any justice of the peace to call in an autopsy when you have, you know, potential drug overdose or what have you.
[03:16:06.676 --> 03:16:09.358]  You know, just like you said, all the celebrities party hard.
[03:16:09.977 --> 03:16:10.777]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[03:16:10.797 --> 03:16:12.258]  Hey, let's get Joe Biggs on right now.
[03:16:12.578 --> 03:16:15.319]  And actually, at the bottom of the hour, I'm also going to have John Rappaport on.
[03:16:15.639 --> 03:16:20.101]  He's written articles, too, talking about how just mysterious this death is.
[03:16:20.141 --> 03:16:25.183]  And it's not a conspiracy theory that people are saying it's a murder, if you look at the facts.
[03:16:26.403 --> 03:16:34.249]  You know, anytime we look at the facts, anytime we put that out there, you immediately have the leftist liberals jump in and say, oh, you're just a conspiracy theorist.
[03:16:34.269 --> 03:16:35.390]  There's nothing to see.
[03:16:35.890 --> 03:16:36.330]  Move along.
[03:16:36.571 --> 03:16:37.271]  He was old.
[03:16:37.351 --> 03:16:38.032]  He smoked.
[03:16:38.072 --> 03:16:38.892]  He was overweight.
[03:16:39.172 --> 03:16:40.133]  It was natural causes.
[03:16:40.173 --> 03:16:40.714]  Get over it.
[03:16:41.274 --> 03:16:48.499]  And I've seen tweets where people are saying the only thing that would have made this better would have been a Clarence Thomas, Anton Scalia murder suicide.
[03:16:48.539 --> 03:16:51.421]  So really vile, vicious stuff going on out there.
[03:16:51.441 --> 03:16:53.423]  I don't wish death on anyone.
[03:16:54.952 --> 03:16:55.533]  At this point.
[03:16:57.115 --> 03:16:58.217]  But we definitely have to look at this.
[03:16:59.419 --> 03:17:02.203]  Blanket, no investigation, nothing to see, pillow on top of the face.
[03:17:02.544 --> 03:17:04.487]  Joe Biggs, what is your take on the event so far?
[03:17:05.387 --> 03:17:11.549]  Well, what's interesting is the fact that both justices of the peace that should have been there to answer that call, like Hitt said, were not available.
[03:17:11.609 --> 03:17:17.911]  That day, for some reason, when they heard the name, they could not take the time out of their day from 120 miles away to come out here.
[03:17:18.132 --> 03:17:21.233]  Now, we do know that feds flew in via helicopter to the ranch.
[03:17:21.493 --> 03:17:27.035]  You mean to tell me these federal agents could not have flown, picked one of these people up, brought them in to do this properly?
[03:17:27.415 --> 03:17:27.655]  No.
[03:17:27.675 --> 03:17:33.417]  Instead, what happened was, this was passed on to County Judge Cinderella Guerrero.
[03:17:33.877 --> 03:17:37.519]  Who is known to already in the past have some botched cases.
[03:17:38.019 --> 03:17:48.184]  Back in 2013 in Big Bend, this county judge, there was a case where a train ran over a woman who was stooped over and the train hit her, sliced her into pieces.
[03:17:49.044 --> 03:17:53.686]  The train company came out, they did their own investigation, figured that they said that there should be an investigation.
[03:17:53.926 --> 03:17:56.047]  The family came out, said there should be an investigation.
[03:17:56.447 --> 03:17:59.769]  And this judge behind us here said over the phone again, nah.
[03:18:00.456 --> 03:18:02.076]  So this is what leads us to believe.
[03:18:02.536 --> 03:18:09.038]  If this is the kind of person who was known to make that kind of decision, was it purposely handed off to her to deal with this?
[03:18:09.458 --> 03:18:10.798]  Is something shady going on?
[03:18:11.298 --> 03:18:12.138]  Was he murdered?
[03:18:12.398 --> 03:18:14.359]  Was this not just natural causes?
[03:18:14.599 --> 03:18:21.440]  So this is what we're trying to find out here in Marfa and at the ranch over the next couple days to find out what's going on with this chain of custody.
[03:18:21.720 --> 03:18:25.781]  This is a case that people should have dropped what they were doing and headed out here immediately.
[03:18:26.021 --> 03:18:26.361]  Exactly.
[03:18:26.401 --> 03:18:29.145]  And they drove him three and a half hours up to El Paso at someone's request.
[03:18:29.165 --> 03:18:30.126]  Wayne Madsen was there.
[03:18:40.998 --> 03:18:41.078]  Yeah.
[03:18:41.098 --> 03:18:41.178]  Yeah.
[03:19:02.563 --> 03:19:05.228]  And one of your friends was shadily murdered as well.
[03:19:05.248 --> 03:19:06.450]  I mean, I'll say he was murdered.
[03:19:06.470 --> 03:19:12.461]  I don't believe his car hit the tree and ejected the motor.
[03:19:12.622 --> 03:19:14.625]  I'm talking about Michael Hastings, for those of you who don't remember.
[03:19:15.287 --> 03:19:19.009]  Yeah, they came out very quickly and said, oh, you know, this guy's got a drug problem, you know.
[03:19:19.569 --> 03:19:29.013]  It's normal for a car to drive down the road and speed and blow up and then blow up again and then swerve to the left and the engine fly out and go in the path of travel that he was driving originally.
[03:19:29.573 --> 03:19:30.474]  Right.
[03:19:30.514 --> 03:19:31.274]  Ejection motors.
[03:19:31.294 --> 03:19:32.675]  We don't have ejection seats anymore.
[03:19:32.735 --> 03:19:33.695]  We have ejection motors.
[03:19:33.715 --> 03:19:35.596]  He was driving a Mercedes or a BMW, right?
[03:19:36.260 --> 03:19:36.500]  Yeah.
[03:19:37.141 --> 03:19:37.602]  Mercedes.
[03:19:37.642 --> 03:19:37.862]  Yeah.
[03:19:38.183 --> 03:19:42.188]  So when something like this happens, it is reasonable for us to question.
[03:19:42.208 --> 03:19:42.869]  Now think about this.
[03:19:42.889 --> 03:19:50.420]  If we had a Republican president, we had a ranch owned by someone who was a Republican donor and a liberal judge died.
[03:19:51.334 --> 03:19:55.498]  The whole left would be up in arms, screaming, crying, asking for an investigation.
[03:19:55.518 --> 03:20:01.745]  If George Bush was in office, and this was Ruth Bader Ginsburg, it would have been, oh my god, he did it, he did it, he did it, we gotta have an investigation.
[03:20:01.765 --> 03:20:03.887]  But when we call for an investigation, no.
[03:20:04.208 --> 03:20:04.428]  Nothing.
[03:20:04.448 --> 03:20:05.028]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:05.068 --> 03:20:05.289]  Stay tuned.
[03:20:05.309 --> 03:20:06.290]  We're gonna have David Knight on.
[03:20:06.350 --> 03:20:07.131]  Thank you, Joe Biggs.
[03:20:08.959 --> 03:20:19.569]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?

[03:20:53.751 --> 03:20:56.852]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.

[03:24:18.797 --> 03:24:20.198]  We are live in the fourth hour.
[03:24:20.238 --> 03:24:22.620]  This is Rob Dew hosting the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:22.960 --> 03:24:36.490]  And I got a tweet from Will Morgan who said, I'm thinking a solid angle on Scalia's death is pinning down who at the Justice Department, or I would just say the Feds in general, ordered the deviation from investigative SOP, which stands for standard operating procedure.
[03:24:36.790 --> 03:24:39.332]  So that is a big question I think should be asked.
[03:24:39.432 --> 03:24:45.797]  Who at the Justice Department or who at the federal marshals made the call that we're not going to do any investigation?
[03:24:46.678 --> 03:24:47.520]  Everybody stand down.
[03:24:47.560 --> 03:24:48.282]  Everybody turn away.
[03:24:48.322 --> 03:24:49.625]  Let's remove the pillow off his head.
[03:24:49.925 --> 03:24:50.968]  Pretend it wasn't there.
[03:24:51.288 --> 03:24:54.816]  And let's whisk the body away three and a half hours to El Paso to be embalmed.
[03:24:56.437 --> 03:25:01.181]  So we have David Knight on the line now with his final thoughts in this short segment.
[03:25:01.201 --> 03:25:07.345]  And then coming back, coming after the break, we're going to have John Rappaport here talking about Scalia's death and also Zika.
[03:25:07.826 --> 03:25:13.430]  Everybody said the Zika virus was cause for microcephaly, where the babies have really small heads.
[03:25:13.450 --> 03:25:15.131]  They're saying that was cause for the birth defect.
[03:25:15.412 --> 03:25:18.534]  Well, now it turns out that they're saying, oh, wait, it was pesticide use.
[03:25:18.874 --> 03:25:21.396]  We had John Rappaport back here in January saying it was pesticides.
[03:25:21.756 --> 03:25:21.856]  OK.
[03:25:22.617 --> 03:25:25.142]  We have people on this show who know what they're talking about.
[03:25:25.182 --> 03:25:29.671]  They don't just guess, they don't just speculate, they don't read off talking point memos from the White House.
[03:25:29.691 --> 03:25:32.718]  So let's go to David Knight now with his thoughts on what he's seen so far.
[03:25:32.738 --> 03:25:32.838]  David.
[03:25:34.178 --> 03:25:35.418]  David Knight, InfoWars.com.
[03:25:35.458 --> 03:25:36.939]  We're here in Marfa, Texas.
[03:25:36.979 --> 03:25:40.280]  And of course, the big pink palace behind us is where Cinderella is.
[03:25:40.860 --> 03:25:42.300]  Cinderella Guevara.
[03:25:42.741 --> 03:25:44.881]  She's the judge who did everything over the phone.
[03:25:45.181 --> 03:25:48.982]  And of course, earlier today, we went to the other judge who first got the call because it was in her area.
[03:25:49.302 --> 03:25:50.963]  She said, well, I can't go.
[03:25:51.143 --> 03:25:52.223]  That's the operative word here.
[03:25:52.423 --> 03:25:52.663]  Go.
[03:25:52.883 --> 03:25:53.924]  So she called somebody else.
[03:25:54.004 --> 03:25:54.584]  David Biba.
[03:25:54.884 --> 03:25:55.604]  We're good to go.
[03:26:18.371 --> 03:26:27.047]  And there were 14 hours that lapsed from the time they started calling judges until the time the body was delivered to El Paso and then sometime after that...
[03:26:27.737 --> 03:26:34.524]  They did the embalming, which essentially destroyed potential evidence, so they can't do a complete autopsy at this point.
[03:26:34.925 --> 03:26:36.086]  So that's what we're concerned about.
[03:26:36.166 --> 03:26:37.147]  Who made that decision?
[03:26:37.227 --> 03:26:40.090]  As you were saying, just as we're coming to the break, that is the crucial point.
[03:26:40.290 --> 03:26:41.371]  Who made this decision?
[03:26:41.552 --> 03:26:43.714]  This is one of the most powerful men in the world.
[03:26:44.114 --> 03:26:49.200]  He was arguably the person who was the biggest obstacle in front of not only Obama,
[03:26:49.680 --> 03:26:52.782]  But in front of the globalist agenda to control our economy.
[03:26:52.802 --> 03:26:55.704]  Remember, it's open borders where we destroy the national borders.
[03:26:56.024 --> 03:27:05.029]  It's also the aspect where we have managed economies, managed by an international commission as part of the Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic partnerships as they call them, the treaties.
[03:27:05.429 --> 03:27:09.452]  And then the other part of that is to set up a global taxation regime.
[03:27:09.912 --> 03:27:16.076]  And that was affected directly by what the Supreme Court decided with a 5-4 majority.
[03:27:16.136 --> 03:27:18.117]  It's not only just a fifth vote.
[03:27:18.678 --> 03:27:22.359]  He was really kind of the intellectual center of the opposition as well.
[03:27:22.679 --> 03:27:28.041]  He was like one of those cement blocks I saw when I was in Switzerland that kept the tanks from rolling down the street, essentially.
[03:27:28.101 --> 03:27:28.281]  Yeah.
[03:27:28.441 --> 03:27:32.462]  Just stood right in their way, wasn't going to move, and you can't move these guys until they die.
[03:27:32.482 --> 03:27:34.683]  That's the only way you're going to get rid of them.
[03:27:35.379 --> 03:27:36.059]  I mean, that's it.
[03:27:36.680 --> 03:27:46.486]  Whenever you got a judge, as I said before with Alex, whenever you got a judge who dies, it's always suspicious because there are always things that are coming up of great importance before them.
[03:27:46.766 --> 03:27:51.629]  There's also decisions that they have decided of great importance that affect or destroy people's lives.
[03:27:51.949 --> 03:27:54.411]  So yes, you should have an investigation.
[03:27:54.431 --> 03:27:57.192]  You should treat it like a homicide until proven otherwise.
[03:27:57.472 --> 03:27:59.814]  You don't just say, well, this guy was 79.
[03:28:00.074 --> 03:28:01.315]  He had some chronic ailments.
[03:28:02.035 --> 03:28:04.997]  He'd seen a doctor before he left, but it was for his shoulder pain.
[03:28:05.297 --> 03:28:06.618]  And he came down here to go hunting.
[03:28:07.058 --> 03:28:10.401]  And being 79 years old doesn't mean that somebody can't kill you.
[03:28:10.461 --> 03:28:15.865]  I mean, at what point do we stop... At what age do we stop investigating potential homicides for people?
[03:28:15.925 --> 03:28:16.646]  Is it 79?
[03:28:16.706 --> 03:28:17.466]  Is it 75?
[03:28:17.546 --> 03:28:18.567]  Is it 70 years old?
[03:28:18.587 --> 03:28:21.889]  And we just write people off and say, hey, he fell over dead, so let's just forget about it.
[03:28:21.929 --> 03:28:28.774]  I mean, if Bernie Sanders, who's gonna be 75 by the time he takes office, if he just dies suddenly somewhere... No investigation.
[03:28:28.834 --> 03:28:29.295]  Exactly.
[03:28:29.515 --> 03:28:30.476]  Embalm him immediately.
[03:28:31.116 --> 03:28:32.537]  Exactly.
[03:28:33.177 --> 03:28:36.919]  So what we're seeing here, Rob, is the same sort of thing we're seeing with Hillary Clinton.
[03:28:37.399 --> 03:28:43.822]  The hypocrisy, and just look the other way, especially if it's a very important person, look the other way, don't do any investigation.
[03:28:43.842 --> 03:28:52.026]  I mean, we have this national security state where they're constantly sending people to jail, accusing them of security violations, and yet when you've got one of the highest ranking people
[03:28:52.546 --> 03:28:56.292]  Yeah, and one of the cases he was looking at with the rest of the justices was
[03:29:08.490 --> 03:29:22.884]  They have a law in Texas where you have to have certain standards before you can perform abortions and this was closing down a lot of clinics so this was obviously getting pushback from the left and they were in the midst of that case and another one was the Affordable Care Act's mandate on covering birth control for female employees.
[03:29:23.644 --> 03:29:29.127]  Well, now the one that you're talking about with abortion, actually his death is not going to affect that case.
[03:29:29.587 --> 03:29:36.130]  Because what will happen is a lower court decision will stand if they get tied in a 4-4 deadlock there.
[03:29:36.490 --> 03:29:41.312]  So, if that were to happen, which is what most people expect is going to happen, there would be no effect on that.
[03:29:41.372 --> 03:29:47.675]  However, because when they have a tie, a 4-4 tie, decisions that were made at a lower level stand.
[03:29:47.695 --> 03:29:48.195]  David, I'll hold you over.
[03:29:48.215 --> 03:29:48.955]  We're about to go to break.
[03:29:48.975 --> 03:29:50.136]  We'll be right back after this.
[03:29:50.156 --> 03:29:52.297]  David Knight finish and then with John Rappaport.
[03:29:57.799 --> 03:30:00.801]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:30:01.721 --> 03:30:04.523]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.025 --> 03:30:23.014]  Russian warplanes are being blamed for carrying out what is being described as a deliberate attack on two makeshift hospitals and a school in northern Syria Monday that killed nearly 50 people, according to the United Nations, reports Fox News.
[03:30:23.934 --> 03:30:30.258]  Doctors Without Borders said that the hospital was hit four times in at least two attacks that were minutes apart.
[03:30:30.838 --> 03:30:35.941]  A third air raid hit a school in a nearby village, killing seven and wounding others.
[03:30:36.261 --> 03:30:45.286]  The Russian Prime Minister issued a blanket denial over the weekend that Moscow was targeting civilians in civilian facilities in Syria, reports The Guardian.
[03:30:45.606 --> 03:30:45.846]  U.S.
[03:30:45.886 --> 03:30:52.994]  Military Colonel Steve Warren on Twitter said the destruction of the Doctors Without Borders hospital was quote, terrible news.
[03:30:53.335 --> 03:30:54.636]  But last year, the U.S.
[03:30:54.716 --> 03:30:59.061]  itself hit a Doctors Without Borders facility in Afghanistan, killing 30 people.
[03:30:59.381 --> 03:31:01.724]  It was chalked up to a quote, human error.
[03:31:02.285 --> 03:31:05.188]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[03:31:10.305 --> 03:31:11.725]  Oil of oregano formulation.
[03:31:12.005 --> 03:31:17.286]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[03:31:17.586 --> 03:31:25.509]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[03:31:25.949 --> 03:31:31.650]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[03:31:32.070 --> 03:31:34.391]  Extracted directly from the wild herb.
[03:31:34.811 --> 03:31:40.855]  And sealed in easy-to-use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[03:31:41.175 --> 03:31:47.039]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[03:31:47.399 --> 03:31:53.763]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[03:31:54.163 --> 03:31:59.206]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[03:31:59.526 --> 03:32:01.708]  Now available at Infowarslife.com.

[03:32:08.117 --> 03:32:08.577]  Hey, everyone!
[03:32:08.937 --> 03:32:11.198]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[03:32:11.238 --> 03:32:14.799]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:32:15.079 --> 03:32:16.660]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:32:17.160 --> 03:32:27.064]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:32:27.424 --> 03:32:33.406]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:32:33.806 --> 03:32:34.227]  We're good to go!
[03:32:48.763 --> 03:32:49.244]  I think so.
[03:33:19.748 --> 03:33:21.049]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:21.129 --> 03:33:26.812]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:33.749 --> 03:33:37.993]  And the answer to defeating lies and cover-ups is to go to the source and ask questions.
[03:33:38.013 --> 03:33:39.914]  And that's what we're doing now with our reporters.
[03:33:39.934 --> 03:33:43.878]  We have four of them down near the Big Bend area in Marfa.
[03:33:44.639 --> 03:33:46.660]  And we got Wayne Madsen up in El Paso.
[03:33:46.680 --> 03:33:53.967]  They're going to meet up, I think possibly tomorrow, down at Cibolo Creek Ranch, the place where Justice Anton Scalia died.
[03:33:53.987 --> 03:33:56.929]  Do you guys have the clip ready of what he said on Fox News back in 2012?
[03:33:59.073 --> 03:34:01.456]  Okay, so basically we have an article up.
[03:34:01.636 --> 03:34:03.278]  You guys can, it's a 28 second clip.
[03:34:03.378 --> 03:34:04.699]  You guys can go listen to this for yourself.
[03:34:04.719 --> 03:34:05.740]  Go to Infowars.com.
[03:34:06.141 --> 03:34:07.442]  It's in the slider right now.
[03:34:07.502 --> 03:34:08.804]  Flashback, Scalia dared.
[03:34:09.004 --> 03:34:10.245]  What can Obama do to me?
[03:34:10.505 --> 03:34:13.208]  All right, here's that clip.
[03:34:13.228 --> 03:34:14.570]  Let's hear what he's had to say.
[03:34:15.110 --> 03:34:18.955]  Do you feel any pressure as a result of that to vote a certain way?
[03:34:18.975 --> 03:34:19.515]  No.
[03:34:20.216 --> 03:34:20.977]  What can he do to me?
[03:34:23.648 --> 03:34:24.429]  Or to any of us.
[03:34:24.449 --> 03:34:25.410]  We have life tenure.
[03:34:25.790 --> 03:34:30.293]  And we have it precisely so that we will not be influenced by politics.
[03:34:30.954 --> 03:34:32.515]  By threats from anybody.
[03:34:32.655 --> 03:34:33.816]  Did you view that as a threat?
[03:34:35.257 --> 03:34:36.098]  I didn't view it as a threat.
[03:34:36.138 --> 03:34:37.138]  I'm not even sure I heard it.
[03:34:39.060 --> 03:34:39.480]  Well, you heard it.
[03:34:39.520 --> 03:34:39.920]  My pleasure.
[03:34:39.940 --> 03:34:41.141]  You brought it to my attention.
[03:34:42.102 --> 03:34:42.843]  Come on.
[03:34:44.084 --> 03:34:44.484]  There it is.
[03:34:44.524 --> 03:34:45.144]  What can he do to me?
[03:34:45.164 --> 03:34:46.225]  We've got a lifetime appointment.
[03:34:46.265 --> 03:34:47.086]  Well, we could kill you.
[03:34:48.254 --> 03:34:49.575]  You know, that's what we could do.
[03:34:50.356 --> 03:34:53.638]  Somebody else tweeted, this is America lover, who else is staying at the ranch?
[03:34:53.658 --> 03:34:55.280]  That's another good question, David Knight.
[03:34:55.500 --> 03:34:58.142]  Go ahead and finish up what you were saying and then I gotta get to John Rappaport.
[03:34:58.971 --> 03:35:07.413]  Well, real quickly, Rob, what I was going to say is this case that they put a stay on is going to come before a very liberal district court, appeals court in D.C.
[03:35:07.553 --> 03:35:08.113]  in June.
[03:35:08.353 --> 03:35:15.134]  Now, if they decide in favor of Obama's EPA shutdown of the coal industry, it's not clear to me what happens at that point.
[03:35:15.174 --> 03:35:16.694]  Will the Supreme Court will be delayed?
[03:35:16.734 --> 03:35:18.775]  Will they wait until there's a ninth judge?
[03:35:18.835 --> 03:35:20.315]  Who will appoint that judge?
[03:35:20.355 --> 03:35:23.896]  So this is all back in play again, that very important decision.
[03:35:23.936 --> 03:35:25.676]  But real quickly, I just want to say one other thing.
[03:35:26.256 --> 03:35:27.057]  Well, we've been here.
[03:35:27.137 --> 03:35:34.404]  We've had more than once locals come up and talk to us and say, this isn't the first time something really strange has happened here.
[03:35:34.624 --> 03:35:41.451]  And of course, that case that Joe Biggs was talking about, 2013, a newlywed who was on the train tracks, unconscious.
[03:35:41.611 --> 03:35:47.417]  As the train investigator said, it looked as if she had been placed on the train tracks, was unconscious.
[03:35:47.557 --> 03:35:50.500]  Cinderella Guevara at the time said, no, it's a suicide.
[03:35:51.132 --> 03:35:55.774]  They cremated her body before they did any kind of autopsy before the family really even knew about it.
[03:35:56.234 --> 03:36:01.997]  And they had, uh, the basis of it being a suicide was that she had recently resigned from her job.
[03:36:02.037 --> 03:36:03.438]  She'd just recently been married.
[03:36:03.658 --> 03:36:04.638]  They didn't do a rape kit.
[03:36:04.899 --> 03:36:06.960]  They didn't do any kind of blood test.
[03:36:07.080 --> 03:36:09.921]  And her personal effects are quite some distance from the railroad tracks.
[03:36:09.941 --> 03:36:17.685]  So there's a lot of things there that indicated that this particular judge would just kind of do a hand waving and let things go along.
[03:36:18.045 --> 03:36:20.406]  And, uh, that we've seen that in the past year as well.
[03:36:20.626 --> 03:36:22.106]  Justice via telephone.
[03:36:22.126 --> 03:36:23.387]  Well, you guys are going to be on the case.
[03:36:23.407 --> 03:36:24.527]  Can't wait to see your reports.
[03:36:25.367 --> 03:36:27.288]  Get to that ranch and talk to that owner.
[03:36:27.368 --> 03:36:30.089]  If he doesn't want to talk to you, there's something really suspicious about that.
[03:36:30.449 --> 03:36:31.649]  And find out who else was there.
[03:36:32.149 --> 03:36:32.929]  Who else was at the ranch.
[03:36:32.949 --> 03:36:33.870]  I know they're not going to want to say it.
[03:36:33.890 --> 03:36:38.411]  He's got an unknown friend who may or may not have been there who mentioned take him to El Paso.
[03:36:39.091 --> 03:36:39.552]  Who knows?
[03:36:39.592 --> 03:36:46.718]  There's a lot of questions to be answered and nobody else is doing the investigating, so that's why we have our InfoWars.com reporters on the ground there.
[03:36:46.758 --> 03:36:47.939]  Thank you very much, David Knight.
[03:36:48.439 --> 03:36:51.702]  Now, my next guest from NoMoreFakeNews.com is John Rampaport.
[03:36:51.722 --> 03:37:01.651]  He's been a freelance investigative reporter for over 30 years, author of many books, and he really came out on the forefront when we had him on at the end of January talking about the Zika virus.
[03:37:02.051 --> 03:37:06.216]  He said, you know what, I think this is going to be pesticide related or related to the vaccine.
[03:37:06.236 --> 03:37:09.400]  I don't think it has anything to do with the Zika virus, but this is what we always see.
[03:37:09.420 --> 03:37:11.302]  And I got a clip we may come to later.
[03:37:11.342 --> 03:37:14.046]  But John, you've definitely been vindicated on this.
[03:37:14.086 --> 03:37:16.609]  And you've also come out and talked about Scalia.
[03:37:16.649 --> 03:37:18.071]  You had an article yesterday.
[03:37:18.091 --> 03:37:18.992]  What do you want to go with first?
[03:37:19.906 --> 03:37:22.368]  Well, let's take Scalia because that's what we're talking about.
[03:37:22.408 --> 03:37:23.448]  It's hot, I tell ya.
[03:37:23.909 --> 03:37:24.589]  This is hot.
[03:37:25.149 --> 03:37:29.612]  Melanie Parker, 2013, dead on the railroad tracks.
[03:37:29.712 --> 03:37:31.773]  I just posted an article about that.
[03:37:32.234 --> 03:37:40.659]  The same, you know, tin horn judge, Rivera, did in fact rule that it was a suicide based on nothing.
[03:37:41.199 --> 03:37:46.303]  Based on really no coroner's report at all, much less an autopsy.
[03:37:46.983 --> 03:37:48.184]  No autopsy done.
[03:37:49.494 --> 03:37:50.155]  Case closed.
[03:37:50.255 --> 03:37:50.915]  No problem.
[03:37:50.995 --> 03:37:52.677]  Same thing here with Scalia.
[03:37:53.578 --> 03:38:00.204]  So, you know, people are asking, well, is the Texas governor going to order an investigation?
[03:38:00.664 --> 03:38:01.665]  What are you talking about?
[03:38:02.366 --> 03:38:04.488]  What about the federal government?
[03:38:05.239 --> 03:38:09.521]  You know, are you saying that this is not a federal case if a U.S.
[03:38:09.561 --> 03:38:13.362]  Supreme Court justice dies under strange circumstances?
[03:38:13.763 --> 03:38:31.370]  We're hearing nothing about an FBI investigation being opened, nothing from the Attorney General, nothing from politicians in Washington who should be screaming their heads off that a Supreme Court justice of the United States dies and no autopsy is done?
[03:38:32.057 --> 03:38:39.004]  And a ruling is made off the cuff like that from a judge who's shown to be completely incompetent.
[03:38:39.064 --> 03:38:42.027]  A total goofball at the best.
[03:38:42.948 --> 03:38:49.975]  And there is nothing going on in Washington except that we're very sad to say that Supreme Court Justice, you know, passed away.
[03:38:50.375 --> 03:38:51.436]  No task force.
[03:38:51.497 --> 03:38:53.719]  And Dick Cheney, his buddy, said no comment.
[03:38:53.879 --> 03:38:54.199]  Nothing.
[03:38:54.259 --> 03:38:54.580]  Just like...
[03:38:55.250 --> 03:38:56.070]  Yeah, no comment.
[03:38:56.470 --> 03:39:01.991]  Yeah, it's as if they're saying, well, look, we know the public is completely asleep.
[03:39:02.451 --> 03:39:04.412]  Yeah, they've been hypnotized successfully.
[03:39:04.852 --> 03:39:07.872]  So there's not going to be any outcry on that level.
[03:39:08.212 --> 03:39:09.372]  So why should we care?
[03:39:09.813 --> 03:39:15.954]  You know, so in case, in fact, we did kill him, there's just not going to be any push for an investigation.
[03:39:16.294 --> 03:39:17.494]  That's completely absurd.
[03:39:17.514 --> 03:39:23.195]  I mean, I assume that there's a whole lot of people out there in the United States by now
[03:39:23.875 --> 03:39:25.175]  Who don't even know what the U.S.
[03:39:25.195 --> 03:39:32.177]  Supreme Court is, and they've never heard of Scalia, and so they're just totally asleep at the wheel.
[03:39:32.717 --> 03:39:34.118]  But, you know, the U.S.
[03:39:34.158 --> 03:39:41.259]  Supreme Court, in case anybody's, you know, in the dark about this, is the highest judicial authority in the land.
[03:39:41.740 --> 03:39:47.061]  And so the unexplained death of a Supreme Court justice
[03:39:47.782 --> 03:40:02.156]  Would be on the same level as the death of a president, or vice president, or speaker of the house, or anything of that level, at least, at least.
[03:40:03.057 --> 03:40:05.179]  And yet nothing, absolutely nothing.
[03:40:05.539 --> 03:40:08.622]  I mean, reporters, mainstream reporters,
[03:40:09.477 --> 03:40:15.021]  Don't find it curious that the FBI is not opening investigation into this death?
[03:40:15.081 --> 03:40:16.241]  That they're saying nothing?
[03:40:16.722 --> 03:40:18.523]  That nothing is happening at all?
[03:40:19.031 --> 03:40:21.272]  I mean, who are these friggin' people, anyway?
[03:40:21.492 --> 03:40:21.952]  Exactly.
[03:40:22.052 --> 03:40:25.433]  And then you have in your article that you wrote, was Justice Scalia murdered?
[03:40:25.473 --> 03:40:27.294]  Forget conspiracy theory, this is real.
[03:40:27.794 --> 03:40:31.615]  You have a quote from William O. Ritchie, former head of criminal investigations for D.C.
[03:40:31.655 --> 03:40:31.976]  police.
[03:40:32.376 --> 03:40:35.297]  You have a Supreme Court justice who died not in attendance of a physician.
[03:40:35.397 --> 03:40:36.977]  You have a non-homicide trained U.S.
[03:40:37.017 --> 03:40:39.538]  marshal tell the justice of the peace that no foul play was deserved.
[03:40:39.838 --> 03:40:43.880]  You have the justice of Pernice pronounce the death while not being on the scene without any medical training.
[03:40:44.780 --> 03:40:46.743]  Uh, pinning that, uh, he died of a heart attack.
[03:40:46.803 --> 03:40:48.024]  What medical proof exists?
[03:40:48.465 --> 03:40:49.246]  There is none!
[03:40:50.167 --> 03:40:51.709]  And now it's all been flushed down the drain!
[03:40:52.249 --> 03:40:52.930]  By the embalmer.
[03:40:53.471 --> 03:40:55.734]  And now the last, uh, but, right, by the embalmer.
[03:40:55.794 --> 03:41:00.059]  And now the last thing that we're hearing is, well, yes, he did have a heart condition, so...
[03:41:00.825 --> 03:41:19.870]  Therefore, we can just automatically assume, without any medical examination whatsoever, that a US Supreme Court justice died of a heart attack in his sleep, and the pillow was just on his face, and that's the end of that story, and we don't need to worry about who else was at the ranch, or the fact that Poindexter was a...
[03:41:20.530 --> 03:41:26.593]  You know, contributor to the Democratic Party, or a Democratic supporter, or that he received an award from Obama.
[03:41:26.873 --> 03:41:30.695]  I mean, nothing of this could possibly be relevant.
[03:41:30.775 --> 03:41:38.918]  So we can just excuse all of that, and then we'll have a funeral, and his body will lie in state in Washington for a few days or a week.
[03:41:39.338 --> 03:41:40.799]  We don't care about the family.
[03:41:40.839 --> 03:41:49.863]  We don't care that the family is completely silent, that they have nothing to say, or at least as far as we know they have nothing to say because nothing is being reported.
[03:41:50.760 --> 03:41:58.286]  I mean, the scandal here is just enormous, regardless of the fact of whether or not he was, in fact, murdered.
[03:41:58.926 --> 03:42:06.072]  The fact that there is no federal investigation that has been opened into this, I mean, that's called a clue, folks.
[03:42:06.712 --> 03:42:07.773]  That is a clue.
[03:42:07.793 --> 03:42:08.714]  It's called a cover-up.
[03:42:09.494 --> 03:42:09.995]  I'll say it.
[03:42:10.135 --> 03:42:10.816]  It's a cover-up.
[03:42:11.696 --> 03:42:12.697]  They're covering something up.
[03:42:13.478 --> 03:42:17.761]  It's just unconscionable, unbelievable.
[03:42:18.507 --> 03:42:24.789]  That this is going on, and of course, the docile press just follows in line.
[03:42:25.189 --> 03:42:35.091]  Tragic death, statements from people, well, we didn't agree with his policy, but, you know, he's an extraordinary man, years of service, blah, blah, blah, etc, etc.
[03:42:35.111 --> 03:42:42.713]  And then we've, of course, got people on the left who probably say, well, we shouldn't investigate Scalia because, you know, it's better that he's dead.
[03:42:42.793 --> 03:42:44.033]  So let's just leave it at that.
[03:42:44.373 --> 03:42:48.054]  That's their version of, you know, logic and constitutionality.
[03:42:48.826 --> 03:42:54.091]  So, it doesn't matter what side he was on, what judgments he made, etc., etc.
[03:42:54.511 --> 03:43:01.097]  The fact is, the position he held, the position he held, how many other
[03:43:02.526 --> 03:43:13.389]  People in the federal government in important positions could die in unknown circumstances without any sort of FBI investigation.
[03:43:13.409 --> 03:43:20.872]  I mean, you would be having investigations all over the place if a senator suddenly died in circumstances like that.
[03:43:20.892 --> 03:43:27.914]  I mean, the degree of mind control here is absolutely extraordinary.
[03:43:28.683 --> 03:43:30.805]  Yeah, and it kind of reminds me of Breitbart.
[03:43:31.166 --> 03:43:34.429]  Breitbart's walking down the road, all of a sudden falls down, grabbing his chest.
[03:43:35.430 --> 03:43:42.697]  They go immediately heart attack, 43 years old, and dies just like that, right after he says he's got some big video coming out that's going to submarine Obama.
[03:43:43.318 --> 03:43:50.485]  And then suddenly the video that came out didn't seem that big, so it makes you wonder if they really put out the video that Breitbart was going to put out.
[03:43:51.687 --> 03:43:56.229]  Yeah, there's many other cases like this, but none involving a U.S.
[03:43:56.269 --> 03:43:57.370]  Supreme Court Justice.
[03:43:57.590 --> 03:43:58.070]  Exactly.
[03:43:58.190 --> 03:43:59.591]  Yeah, I mean, this is unprecedented.
[03:43:59.751 --> 03:44:02.012]  You know, yeah, it's completely unprecedented.
[03:44:02.412 --> 03:44:07.694]  And so when Michael Savage said, you know, we need a Warren Commission for this, and a lot of people would say, what is he talking about?
[03:44:07.714 --> 03:44:08.915]  No, he's absolutely right.
[03:44:09.275 --> 03:44:12.596]  That's the level on which this death occurred.
[03:44:13.217 --> 03:44:14.937]  That's the level on which it occurred.
[03:44:15.518 --> 03:44:17.979]  And so it just shows
[03:44:18.792 --> 03:44:29.620]  That people have fallen into such a state of total ignorance about, you know, branches of government, what it means, what the Constitution says.
[03:44:30.381 --> 03:44:35.004]  Forget whether or not the Supreme Court actually has been reflecting the Constitution.
[03:44:35.204 --> 03:44:36.285]  They're supposed to.
[03:44:37.166 --> 03:44:39.968]  So you may as well say, well, since we don't care,
[03:44:40.740 --> 03:44:49.213]  That Scalia died under unknown circumstances with very strange, you know, surroundings and that there was no autopsy.
[03:44:49.573 --> 03:44:56.284]  Since we don't care about that, let's just eliminate the entire Supreme Court since we pay so little attention to this guy's death.
[03:44:56.744 --> 03:45:18.447]  And let's just transfer everything over to the executive branch, because it's a lot faster, it's a lot simpler, and I'm sure that if, you know, some of these folks went out there with surveys and started talking to people on the street, you would get at least 60-70% people agreeing, yeah, we don't need this thing, we don't even know what the Supreme Court is, let's just let the President decide all these things.
[03:45:18.823 --> 03:45:19.944]  Mark Dice, I hope you heard that.
[03:45:20.244 --> 03:45:21.765]  Get out there and talk to the zombies.
[03:45:48.983 --> 03:45:50.144]  T-D-A-P.
[03:45:50.244 --> 03:45:51.225]  T-D-A-P, that's right.
[03:45:51.305 --> 03:45:51.845]  The T-DAP.
[03:45:52.966 --> 03:45:57.810]  And now, I did a report yesterday on a TechCrunch article.
[03:45:59.552 --> 03:46:06.337]  Larvicide manufactured by Cemento, not Zika virus, true cause of Brazil's microcephaly outbreak, say doctors.
[03:46:06.357 --> 03:46:14.384]  This is a group of Argentinian doctors that was looking at this larvicide, which the, see if I can pronounce this right,
[03:46:14.884 --> 03:46:17.447]  Pyroproxifen.
[03:46:17.487 --> 03:46:18.088]  Exactly.
[03:46:18.108 --> 03:46:20.731]  I've been rehearsing that for a long time.
[03:46:20.771 --> 03:46:28.439]  Yeah, pyroproxifen is, it turns out they were dumping that in the drinking water in this state in Brazil and then 12 months later...
[03:46:29.921 --> 03:46:34.886]  Eight months later, nine months later, these women are having microcephaly outbreaks while they're drinking pesticide.
[03:46:35.026 --> 03:46:36.928]  You're not supposed to pour it in the drinking water.
[03:46:39.510 --> 03:46:51.361]  And this looks like a big cover-up, because they come out and say it's Zika, it's Zika, it's Zika, and we get this big push to have guerrilla warfare and states of emergencies in Hawaii over Zika virus.
[03:46:51.381 --> 03:46:52.502]  We're going to fight Zika.
[03:46:52.903 --> 03:46:54.685]  It seems like the same thing they were doing with Ebola.
[03:46:55.265 --> 03:47:00.588]  Just these fake medical emergencies when it's, well, they're actually just dumping pesticides in the water supply.
[03:47:00.608 --> 03:47:06.892]  Ebola, swine flu, bird flu, SARS, West Nile, go all the way back.
[03:47:07.292 --> 03:47:08.093]  It's the same story.
[03:47:08.113 --> 03:47:10.634]  I've been covering these epidemics for a long time now.
[03:47:11.335 --> 03:47:13.356]  And here's the thing that people don't realize.
[03:47:14.377 --> 03:47:21.561]  First of all, it's not just pyroxy, pyroproxy, again, pyroproxysin.
[03:47:21.821 --> 03:47:23.162]  Yeah, it's not just that.
[03:47:23.883 --> 03:47:29.849]  It's the fact that you've got all kinds of other pesticides in Brazil because they're the biggest users of pesticides in the world.
[03:47:30.390 --> 03:47:35.676]  And they're using pesticides that are banned in 22 other countries because they're too toxic.
[03:47:36.256 --> 03:47:44.004]  So those corporate predators that use and sell and make those vaccines, make those pesticides, they have to be protected, you see.
[03:47:44.385 --> 03:47:45.446]  Oh, we need a cover story.
[03:47:45.826 --> 03:48:07.652]  Because we're talking about ongoing death and destruction in Brazil from pesticides, and we're talking about areas of the country where people intentionally are maintained in a state of poverty, severe malnutrition, lack of basic sanitation, overcrowding, etc, etc, failed vaccine campaigns that are toxic, and so on and so on.
[03:48:08.053 --> 03:48:09.593]  This is the steady state
[03:48:10.347 --> 03:48:19.310]  condition of these people, some of whom work on these massive corporate agri-plantations and so on, and around these pesticides all the time.
[03:48:19.710 --> 03:48:35.195]  So let's choose this virus called Zika, which was discovered in 1947, never shown to be toxic whatsoever, mild transient illness, goes away in a few days, etc., etc., and we'll blame it on this virus, and then
[03:48:35.895 --> 03:48:41.719]  Now we have the Brazilian researchers coming back with a second look at all of this saying, guess what?
[03:48:41.799 --> 03:48:52.387]  We can only confirm any trace of this virus, Zika, in 17 cases of microcephaly in the whole country of Brazil.
[03:48:52.867 --> 03:48:53.147]  Okay?
[03:48:53.568 --> 03:48:55.589]  So folks, that's called the clue as well.
[03:48:56.029 --> 03:48:59.812]  That's the clue that Zika is not the cause of anything.
[03:49:00.252 --> 03:49:05.136]  But the World Health Organization, you see, can make tremendous hay out of that because
[03:49:05.945 --> 03:49:11.569]  They know that this virus probably been on the planet for, what, a hundred thousand years?
[03:49:11.669 --> 03:49:15.571]  Been around and around the planet over and over again, causes nothing.
[03:49:15.991 --> 03:49:18.233]  They can now say, well, we found a case in Texas.
[03:49:18.273 --> 03:49:19.534]  We found three in Alaska.
[03:49:19.834 --> 03:49:21.215]  We found two in Indonesia.
[03:49:21.255 --> 03:49:22.415]  We found some in France.
[03:49:22.516 --> 03:49:23.156]  Oh my goodness.
[03:49:23.216 --> 03:49:24.037]  And one in New York.
[03:49:24.377 --> 03:49:24.857]  Well, sure.
[03:49:25.277 --> 03:49:26.438]  It's been there forever.
[03:49:26.518 --> 03:49:27.579]  It's like HPV.
[03:49:27.859 --> 03:49:32.362]  Everybody has got HPV or not got, you know, everybody gets in there like, well, this will get rid of HPV.
[03:49:32.782 --> 03:49:34.624]  Wherever you look.
[03:49:34.864 --> 03:49:37.686]  I use the analogy of Volkswagens.
[03:49:38.367 --> 03:49:42.150]  Researchers have discovered that people are driving Volkswagens in Brazil.
[03:49:42.591 --> 03:49:45.253]  So let's start looking for Volkswagens somewhere else.
[03:49:45.353 --> 03:49:45.533]  What?
[03:49:45.593 --> 03:49:46.714]  We found them in Germany?
[03:49:46.754 --> 03:49:47.375]  In France?
[03:49:47.835 --> 03:49:49.517]  They're spreading to the United States?
[03:49:49.637 --> 03:49:49.797]  No.
[03:49:50.137 --> 03:49:51.839]  They've been there all along.
[03:49:52.532 --> 03:50:07.146]  But now the World Health Organization can use Zika as the infecting spreading virus that's causing microcephaly when in fact it's clear and any doctor worth his salt who knows the literature will tell you
[03:50:08.115 --> 03:50:14.698]  Any insult to the fetal brain during pregnancy can cause microcephaly.
[03:50:15.059 --> 03:50:16.659]  Woman is punched in the stomach.
[03:50:16.739 --> 03:50:18.240]  Woman falls downstairs.
[03:50:18.680 --> 03:50:20.421]  Woman ingests a pesticide.
[03:50:20.762 --> 03:50:24.083]  Woman ingests a toxic medical drug or a toxic street drug.
[03:50:24.583 --> 03:50:30.086]  Anything that creates that kind of insult to the fetal brain can cause microcephaly.
[03:50:30.186 --> 03:50:31.147]  Everybody knows that.
[03:50:31.547 --> 03:50:32.507]  So it's not Zika.
[03:50:32.567 --> 03:50:34.108]  It has nothing to do with that.
[03:50:34.548 --> 03:50:35.249]  This is
[03:50:35.909 --> 03:50:38.470]  Once again, the promotion of fear.
[03:50:39.131 --> 03:50:41.572]  Citizens must comply, must be afraid.
[03:50:42.072 --> 03:50:52.297]  You've got women in Central and South America, where abortion is either completely outlawed in certain countries or severely restricted, getting abortions at sea.
[03:50:52.317 --> 03:50:53.238]  On boats, yeah.
[03:50:53.438 --> 03:50:53.858]  Exactly.
[03:50:54.038 --> 03:50:55.179]  Hey, John, I'm gonna let you finish up.
[03:50:55.219 --> 03:51:01.482]  Come back for our last segment with John Rappaport, investigative journalist, who called it from the beginning, Zika virus a total hoax.

[03:54:28.917 --> 03:54:30.319]  That's right, that's out of the Wall Street Journal.
[03:54:30.359 --> 03:54:33.282]  Brazil state bans pesticide after Zika claim.
[03:54:34.358 --> 03:54:38.281]  Okay, so health officials are doing this on the warning from Argentine doctors.
[03:54:38.301 --> 03:54:41.023]  We're going to go back to John Rappaport in just one second.
[03:54:41.423 --> 03:54:43.165]  But first, I want to tell you about BrainForce.
[03:54:44.005 --> 03:54:49.770]  It's how we make everything possible as people go into InfoWareStore.com and getting the products, becoming members of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:54:49.790 --> 03:54:51.831]  It's how we got our reporters out in West Texas right now.
[03:54:52.992 --> 03:55:17.305]  Rainforce is one of the products we sell and we have an ad going around right now talking about how when I was cutting the Lewis Farrakhan, the two-hour version of the interview, Josh Owens did the 50-minute boil-down version and I was cutting the whole interview together and I hadn't had much time in the week to work on it because when you're sitting down editing it just it takes a lot of concentration and you can't it's hard when you get bothered so I was coming in at night working on it.
[03:55:17.765 --> 03:55:19.727]  And we were going to put this out on Wednesday.
[03:55:20.047 --> 03:55:23.710]  Tuesday night, I get in to the office about 8.30 and I'm feeling run down.
[03:55:24.551 --> 03:55:25.412]  Two brain force.
[03:55:25.852 --> 03:55:27.754]  I was going strong to about 4 a.m.
[03:55:27.794 --> 03:55:33.459]  Then I started getting a little tired, finished up at 6.30, went home, slept for three hours, woke up the next morning.
[03:55:34.400 --> 03:55:34.860]  We're good to go.
[03:55:56.351 --> 03:55:58.612]  Go out partying a hard day or whatever you do.
[03:55:58.732 --> 03:55:59.373]  Stay up late.
[03:55:59.673 --> 03:56:01.854]  Get up in the morning early and take a couple of these.
[03:56:01.874 --> 03:56:09.778]  Your brain will instantly, for me it does, it instantly clears the fog, the fog of what I say life, the fog of life getting in the way.
[03:56:09.818 --> 03:56:18.403]  Now going back to John Rappaport, finish up on Zika and tell people where they can get more information on your news that you write because you're coming out with great articles all the time.
[03:56:19.522 --> 03:56:28.067]  Yes, I think I've written probably a dozen articles about Zika and nomorefakenews.com is where they can get that material.
[03:56:29.268 --> 03:56:43.716]  So, to sum up what I was getting to before we took the break, there are many different factors here that are suppressing the immune systems and destroying the lives of people in places like Brazil, like northeastern Brazil.
[03:56:44.677 --> 03:56:53.587]  And we should definitely mention the Tdap vaccine, tetanus diphtheria pertussis, because it has aluminum compounds in it that are neurotoxic.
[03:56:54.047 --> 03:56:58.292]  They crossed the blood-brain barrier in 2014 in Brazil.
[03:56:58.752 --> 03:57:04.098]  Health authority recommended suddenly that vaccine for pregnant women in Brazil.
[03:57:04.618 --> 03:57:05.980]  That's a major factor here.
[03:57:07.150 --> 03:57:12.277]  We're not looking to find, you know, the one thing that has to be the only one thing.
[03:57:12.658 --> 03:57:17.544]  There are a lot of things, as we described, for example, of pesticides that are operating there.
[03:57:17.965 --> 03:57:20.949]  And all of this needs to be covered up.
[03:57:21.539 --> 03:57:23.641]  By the people who are in charge.
[03:57:24.562 --> 03:57:26.503]  And we're talking about Brazil.
[03:57:26.523 --> 03:57:28.305]  We're not talking about the United States.
[03:57:28.885 --> 03:57:34.610]  There's a lot more protests, a lot more boiling under the surface and out in the streets there.
[03:57:35.050 --> 03:57:39.554]  There are doctors there who have blown the whistle on this particular larvicide.
[03:57:39.954 --> 03:57:43.137]  Not just Argentine doctors, but Brazil doctors as well.
[03:57:44.138 --> 03:57:46.740]  All of this goes on all the time in Brazil.
[03:57:47.200 --> 03:57:50.383]  And so the government and their allies and corporate
[03:57:51.076 --> 03:57:52.617]  You know, huge predators.
[03:57:53.218 --> 03:57:54.679]  They have to put the lid on this.
[03:57:55.200 --> 03:58:04.527]  They always need to come up once in a while with a tall tale, a horror movie that's going to scare people and divert their attention, just like the old shell game.
[03:58:04.568 --> 03:58:07.690]  And in this case, it's the harmless Zika virus.
[03:58:07.750 --> 03:58:18.860]  And the World Health Organization is the PR agency that steps in right at the beginning with their virus hunters and claims, ah, we found it, when they haven't found anything.
[03:58:19.935 --> 03:58:20.575]  Exactly.
[03:58:20.635 --> 03:58:23.336]  They haven't found anything and they want to use that to cover up.
[03:58:23.696 --> 03:58:26.196]  I was just pointing out the MSDS, a pyroparoxifen.
[03:58:26.876 --> 03:58:31.297]  They say chronic exposure includes changes in the liver, kidney and red blood cells.
[03:58:31.697 --> 03:58:33.197]  But it didn't produce cancer, so it's okay.
[03:58:34.037 --> 03:58:36.038]  And like you said, it's not just that, it's other things.
[03:58:36.098 --> 03:58:43.239]  The Tdap vaccine, by the way, after you get that fourth booster shot, it's only, after four years, after you get that booster, it's only 9% effective.
[03:58:43.519 --> 03:58:44.539]  And that's what they're saying.
[03:58:45.139 --> 03:58:45.880]  So we'll have more.
[03:58:46.140 --> 03:58:47.680]  Stay tuned to Infowars.com for more reports.
[03:58:47.740 --> 03:58:48.500]  I'm Rob Due reporting.
