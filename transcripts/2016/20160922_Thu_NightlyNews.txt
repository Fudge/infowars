[00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:20.965]  Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:22.867]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.987 --> 00:00:23.927]  I'm Darren McBreen.
[00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:25.628]  Today is Thursday, September 22, 2016.
[00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.311]  Here's a quick look at what's coming up.
[00:00:32.773 --> 00:00:38.016]  Tonight, we look at possibly the biggest drug smuggling operation in history.
[00:00:38.356 --> 00:00:43.919]  The Clintons and Bushes, stronger together, with their ties to MENA Arkansas and Iran-Contra.
[00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.623]  This criminal enterprise, exposed in the 1980s, continues to this day with the Rape of Haiti.
[00:00:50.768 --> 00:00:55.669]  There are new accusations today of pay-to-play scandals rocking the Clinton campaign.
[00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:02.211]  And a flashback with a young Alex Jones talking to one of the whistleblowers exposing the Bush-Clinton drug connection.
[00:01:02.231 --> 00:01:07.852]  In the Air Force, I worked directly with the FBI's counterintelligence division for three years.
[00:01:08.712 --> 00:01:11.693]  And then that led me into contract work with the CIA.
[00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:15.107]  In an obscure place called Mena, Arkansas.
[00:01:15.147 --> 00:01:19.832]  And here at home, Hillary hurls racism charges in Charlotte like a Molotov cocktail.
[00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:23.196]  Will she be held accountable for her reckless demagoguery?
[00:01:23.436 --> 00:01:24.117]  Of course not.
[00:01:24.457 --> 00:01:27.260]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.962 --> 00:01:32.924]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:01:33.084 --> 00:01:39.929]  Join us for our live coverage of the upcoming debate between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton on September 26th.
[00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:47.494]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash show for all the live coverage and also go to the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[00:01:47.614 --> 00:01:48.995]  Will Hillary wear an earpiece?
[00:01:49.035 --> 00:01:55.820]  Will Donald Trump and Hillary actually be on the same stage or will they try to do another forum like we've seen before?
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.142]  This is all going to be leading up to our
[00:01:58.322 --> 00:01:59.082]  We're good to go.
[00:03:02.346 --> 00:03:12.478]  What if I told you that two former US presidents were once part of the largest drug smuggling operations in American history?
[00:03:12.898 --> 00:03:17.303]  You'd probably say I was one of those crazy conspiracy theorists, right?
[00:03:18.024 --> 00:03:27.632]  But wait a minute, I want you to take a look at this because there is compelling evidence that suggests that George H.W.
[00:03:27.712 --> 00:03:39.862]  Bush and Bill Clinton were partners in crime in perhaps the most lucrative and brazen drug trafficking operations in the history of the international drug trade.
[00:03:40.182 --> 00:03:41.844]  Now this goes all the way back to the 1980s
[00:03:43.485 --> 00:03:44.726]  After Bush Sr.
[00:03:44.826 --> 00:03:51.108]  was head of the CIA and then vice president, and Bill Clinton was the governor of Arkansas.
[00:03:51.549 --> 00:04:12.618]  They worked hand in hand with the CIA, Oliver North, and notorious drug smuggler Barry Seal to bring in what official IRS and DEA calculations, along with sworn court testimony, amount to $3 billion to $5 billion worth of drugs into the United States.
[00:04:13.158 --> 00:04:16.579]  And this was back in the 1980s, 1981 to 1985.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:39.467]  What they did was set up an airbase in Mena, Arkansas, where the CIA allegedly brought in plane loads of cocaine and heroin from Nicaragua to be sold in the U.S., much of which ended up in South Central Los Angeles, and thus the beginning of the crack epidemic.
[00:04:39.907 --> 00:04:44.451]  And for more on that, you can Google search our interviews with Freeway Ricky Ross.
[00:04:44.792 --> 00:05:04.771]  Now this also has links to the Iran-Contra scandal, because a lot of that money that was made from the drug trafficking ended up in the hands of the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, and also helped pay for illegal arms shipments to the government of Iran.
[00:05:06.266 --> 00:05:13.213]  Sir, the Republicans are trying to blame you for the existence of a small air base at Mena, Arkansas.
[00:05:13.674 --> 00:05:26.287]  This base was set up by George Bush and Oliver North and the CIA to help the Iran contras, and they brought in plane load after plane load of cocaine there for sale in the United States.
[00:05:26.987 --> 00:05:28.248]  Well, let me answer the question.
[00:05:28.268 --> 00:05:29.569]  No, they didn't tell me anything about it.
[00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:31.030]  They didn't say anything to me about it.
[00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.954]  The airport in question and all the events in question were the subject of state and federal inquiries.
[00:05:36.974 --> 00:05:37.634]  It was primarily
[00:05:56.434 --> 00:05:58.575]  Uh, a matter for federal jurisdiction.
[00:05:58.655 --> 00:06:00.696]  The state really had next to nothing to do with it.
[00:06:01.397 --> 00:06:06.960]  A local prosecutor did conduct an investigation based on what was within the jurisdiction of state law.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.303]  The rest of it was under the jurisdiction of the United States Attorneys who were appointed, uh, successively by previous administrations.
[00:06:13.703 --> 00:06:16.905]  We had nothing, zero, to do with it.
[00:06:17.405 --> 00:06:20.087]  And everybody who's ever looked into it knows that.
[00:06:21.906 --> 00:06:37.516]  Now that's a brave woman right there, independent journalist Sarah McClendon, asking President Bill Clinton about the CIA drug running operation in Arkansas while he was governor under his watch.
[00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:44.961]  And notice Bill Clinton, he never denied that it happened, he just said that he didn't have anything to do with it.
[00:06:45.361 --> 00:06:49.264]  And I think it's very interesting and rather suspicious
[00:06:49.864 --> 00:06:58.270]  That Barry Seale, two of his favorite drug trafficking locations were Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Mena, Arkansas.
[00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:08.857]  And it's widely accepted that Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards was paid off big time by Barry Seale to look the other way.
[00:07:09.117 --> 00:07:14.360]  But we're supposed to believe that Bill Clinton, as governor of Arkansas, was never bribed.
[00:07:14.921 --> 00:07:19.744]  And he had no idea what was going on in his own backyard.
[00:07:20.404 --> 00:07:20.565]  Right.
[00:07:20.585 --> 00:07:20.885]  Right.
[00:07:22.026 --> 00:07:28.791]  Why is the life and death of Baton Rouge, Louisiana-born drug smuggler Barry Seale still relevant today?
[00:07:29.192 --> 00:07:48.227]  The revelations surrounding Seale's involvement with the vice presidency of George H. Bush, the Arkansas governorship of Bill Clinton, secret money laundering dealings with the DEA, and CIA Director William J. Casey's shadow government of the United States paints a clear picture of the evolution of the current corruption
[00:07:48.467 --> 00:07:48.908]  That's right.
[00:08:06.909 --> 00:08:21.749]  In the mid-1980s, News Channel 8 reporter Theresa Dickey stumbled onto what would become a goldmine of investigative journalism when she innocently went to report on what appeared to be Governor Bill Clinton's new initiative to bring good jobs to the people of Arkansas.
[00:08:21.929 --> 00:08:35.737]  To her surprise, Theresa Dickey gradually uncovered a massive shadow government operation replete with illegal cargo plane modifications for drug running and money laundering that would have huge ties to the DEA.
[00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:39.920]  And at the center of that deliberate and illegal operation was Barry Seal.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.244]  A fearless drug smuggler and gun runner for the DEA and the CIA.
[00:08:44.404 --> 00:08:50.050]  Seal had been busted for drug smuggling and worked out a deal with the DEA to act as an informant.
[00:09:06.709 --> 00:09:16.134]  I came to the table with a background in Air Force Intelligence.
[00:09:16.254 --> 00:09:17.655]  Eight years during the Vietnam War.
[00:09:17.695 --> 00:09:20.597]  Worked with the CIA and Air America.
[00:09:21.257 --> 00:09:24.579]  And then that led me into contract work with the CIA.
[00:09:25.439 --> 00:09:27.780]  In an obscure place called Mena, Arkansas.
[00:09:28.781 --> 00:09:30.222]  Back when Bill Clinton was Governor.
[00:09:30.742 --> 00:09:32.903]  And back when George Bush was the President.
[00:09:34.099 --> 00:09:45.290]  And I personally witnessed a complicity between these two men, Bush and Clinton, in terms of transporting cocaine into the U.S.
[00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:50.174]  for the purpose of sale to generate money to fight a war.
[00:09:50.234 --> 00:09:57.221]  And that war at the time was the conflict in Central America involving the Sandinistas in Nicaragua.
[00:09:57.481 --> 00:10:11.436]  And after the Iran-Contra hearings detailed Oliver North's diversion of funds to the Contras, and all of the failed indictments never brought anyone to justice, to this day the banks continue to launder the billion-dollar drug cartel industry's money.
[00:10:11.676 --> 00:10:15.400]  And when they are caught, they pay a fine and no one goes to prison.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.882]  Thank you, Clinton and Bush crime family.
[00:10:18.202 --> 00:10:20.685]  Corruption has been largely normalized.
[00:10:20.925 --> 00:10:29.393]  Although all of this evidence may seem irrelevant as the statute of limitations has been surpassed, what does it mean to the upcoming election?
[00:10:29.833 --> 00:10:32.396]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:10:32.736 --> 00:10:33.737]  It means everything.
[00:10:34.057 --> 00:10:38.542]  It means innocent people mysteriously died in Arkansas for no reason.
[00:10:39.795 --> 00:10:48.343]  Because of Linda Ives' investigation into the death of her son, she was placed on Bill Clinton's enemy list by White House Counsel Mark Fabian.
[00:10:50.545 --> 00:10:58.053]  Already, people associated with the case were beginning to die in what amounted to a reign of terror among young people in Alexander, Arkansas.
[00:10:58.618 --> 00:11:15.348]  The crime syndicate operating within the Bush and Clinton families will either be stopped dead in its tracks from entering the executive office once again, or a Hillary presidency will usher in a new age of corruption that will bring the United States to its knees.
[00:11:15.648 --> 00:11:17.670]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:27.399]  And for more on the MENA connection, David Knight joins us now to talk about the unholy alliance between the Bush and Clinton crime families.
[00:11:27.459 --> 00:11:39.872]  And no matter how the mainstream media spins this, David Knight, this is not a conspiracy theory because there's documented evidence that supports all this, even though nine separate investigations were shut down.
[00:11:39.932 --> 00:11:40.633]  Tell us more about that.
[00:11:41.173 --> 00:11:43.555]  State and federal, that happened over a 10-year period.
[00:11:43.575 --> 00:11:50.979]  And of course, Darren, this all began back in 1986, in October, when a plane was shot down that was based out of Mena, Arkansas.
[00:11:51.019 --> 00:11:57.903]  That was Barry Seale's plane that had been using to bring about half a ton of cocaine each month into Mena, Arkansas.
[00:11:58.283 --> 00:12:03.066]  And of course we had connections between Barry Seale and the DEA and the CIA.
[00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:10.532]  Look, you have to understand that the CIA's central funding for their black operations has been drug trafficking.
[00:12:10.552 --> 00:12:12.935]  That's been the situation that's been for decades.
[00:12:13.235 --> 00:12:14.416]  It was centered out of MENA.
[00:12:14.436 --> 00:12:23.264]  Many people believe that it's now centered out of Afghanistan, Turkey, but at that time, back in the 80s and the 90s, it was centered out of MENA, Arkansas.
[00:12:24.105 --> 00:12:31.315]  And when we look at these players, we have to understand it's not just even the Clintons and the Bushes that are still around today.
[00:12:31.335 --> 00:12:39.646]  We've also got people like Robert Gates who just stepped into the presidential election saying about Donald Trump that he was beyond repair.
[00:12:40.447 --> 00:12:43.630]  On national security issues, to which Trump came back.
[00:12:44.191 --> 00:12:50.056]  And of course, Robert Gates was a Secretary of Defense under George W. Bush, as well as Obama.
[00:12:50.076 --> 00:12:52.699]  He served two years under one, three years under the second.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.824]  And Trump came back and said, well, I've never met former Defense Secretary Robert Gates.
[00:12:57.864 --> 00:12:58.865]  He knows nothing about me.
[00:12:58.905 --> 00:13:00.567]  But look at the results under his guidance.
[00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:01.768]  A total disaster.
[00:13:02.168 --> 00:13:08.998]  And he's right, our foreign policy under Gates, under Obama and Hillary Clinton and George Bush have been a total disaster.
[00:13:09.339 --> 00:13:12.683]  Yet Robert Gates goes back to Iran-Contra himself, Darren.
[00:13:13.184 --> 00:13:16.489]  He was the deputy CIA director at the time.
[00:13:17.558 --> 00:13:24.442]  And when William Casey died, suddenly, under kind of mysterious circumstances, he was supposed to testify in the Iran-Contra affair.
[00:13:25.242 --> 00:13:34.387]  The day before he was supposed to testify, the CIA doctor came by his office, examined him, and said, I think you've got a... Well, he had a couple of seizures, right?
[00:13:34.687 --> 00:13:38.830]  They took him in, and he says, you've got a brain tumor, we're not going to do radiation, we must operate.
[00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.591]  Casey didn't want to do an operation, he wanted to do radiation.
[00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:43.632]  They operated, and he never talked again.
[00:13:43.872 --> 00:13:44.793]  He died a few months later.
[00:13:45.854 --> 00:13:55.902]  Robert Gates took his place as Deputy CIA Director, but because he was so tainted by Ron Contra, they knew they could not get him confirmed, so George H.W.
[00:13:55.922 --> 00:13:59.425]  Bush put in someone else, or rather Reagan did.
[00:13:59.565 --> 00:14:00.886]  As soon as George H.W.
[00:14:00.906 --> 00:14:05.230]  Bush became President, Robert Gates became CIA Director as well.
[00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:06.571]  So, when we look at this,
[00:14:07.291 --> 00:14:11.034]  The CIA really is kind of like this inside club, okay?
[00:14:11.094 --> 00:14:13.917]  It's a club that... It's a big club and we're not in it.
[00:14:13.957 --> 00:14:14.357]  That's right.
[00:14:14.677 --> 00:14:18.741]  Kind of the League of Extraordinary Drug Dealers is what I like to refer to it as.
[00:14:19.161 --> 00:14:25.947]  But it's also concerning when we look at Donald Trump talking to James Woolsey as somebody who's going to advise him on this.
[00:14:26.027 --> 00:14:31.371]  Because we have to understand that it was James Woolsey who was selling the attack on Iraq hours after 9-11.
[00:14:32.392 --> 00:14:42.154]  He supports torture, he wants to have the execution of Edward Snowden, and of course he believes in climate change and wants to ban fossil fuels.
[00:14:42.174 --> 00:14:51.135]  So there's a lot of disturbing factors with any of these CIA directors, but they all come back to connections, in one way or the other, to drugs.
[00:14:51.155 --> 00:14:53.356]  That's the common factor that we see with all of these people.
[00:14:53.376 --> 00:14:59.617]  To drugs, and I think it's very significant, going back to the Iran-Contra scandal, because how significant is this?
[00:15:00.177 --> 00:15:02.258]  The plane was called Fat Lady, right?
[00:15:02.298 --> 00:15:05.180]  And it was a C-123K cargo plane.
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.121]  It was owned by Barry Seal.
[00:15:07.481 --> 00:15:12.223]  And it somehow magically resurfaced after he was shot to death in Baton Rouge.
[00:15:12.543 --> 00:15:17.506]  And it was shot down over Nicaragua with a load of weapons headed for the Contras.
[00:15:18.266 --> 00:15:21.628]  And this is what started the whole Iran-Contra scandal.
[00:15:21.708 --> 00:15:25.150]  If it wasn't for that plane being shot down, we might not have ever heard about it.
[00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:25.690]  That's right.
[00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:33.136]  And of course, when that plane was shot down, the pilot and the radio man were killed, but Hassan Fous parachuted out.
[00:15:33.537 --> 00:15:37.760]  He was captured by the Sandinistas, that Reagan and the other people who were fighting the communist Sandinistas.
[00:15:38.221 --> 00:15:44.626]  He confessed at the time to being a CIA operative, and then he later recanted that as the U.S.
[00:15:44.686 --> 00:15:45.466]  government got him out.
[00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:48.008]  In just a few months, got him out of jail with the Sandinistas.
[00:15:48.028 --> 00:15:50.530]  Somehow he'd been sentenced to 30 years in jail.
[00:15:50.871 --> 00:15:52.012]  But we keep seeing this
[00:15:52.592 --> 00:15:53.072]  Recurring theme.
[00:15:53.092 --> 00:16:02.399]  I mean, we could just talk about the planes and how many times you see planes that are loading tons of cocaine and then alternating between that and rendition.
[00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:16.149]  Okay, we had even ten years later, in mid-2000s, 2006, we had a plane that had to make an emergency landing in Mexico, loaded with tons of cocaine, and then the pilot and the plane disappeared.
[00:16:16.169 --> 00:16:20.912]  Well, later we find out that they're doing renditions out of Mexico of people involved in the drug wars.
[00:16:21.332 --> 00:16:26.434]  A year later, a plane crashes, loaded with tons of cocaine.
[00:16:27.014 --> 00:16:31.415]  We learned that that plane had been used for renditions by the CIA for Gitmo prisoners.
[00:16:31.435 --> 00:16:46.560]  So there's always this recurring, rotating door between drugs, guns, the CIA, and these planes, as well as the CIA directors, who now are inserting themselves at every level into this current election.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:52.747]  And now we know that the Bush family is going to vote for Hillary Clinton.
[00:16:52.867 --> 00:16:53.448]  No surprise.
[00:16:53.668 --> 00:16:55.010]  And that should be a big surprise.
[00:16:55.030 --> 00:17:01.697]  It's probably a big surprise for a lot of people, but for those of us living outside of the matrix, no surprise at all.
[00:17:02.818 --> 00:17:11.763]  You've often referred to Bill Clinton and you talked about his relationship with your father and how it developed and your mother as well and he's your brother from another mother.
[00:17:12.564 --> 00:17:14.965]  What does that make Hillary Clinton to the Bush family?
[00:17:15.706 --> 00:17:16.566]  My sister-in-law.
[00:17:17.687 --> 00:17:18.227]  Interesting.
[00:17:18.627 --> 00:17:27.492]  He thinks of George a little bit like the father he didn't have and he's very loving to him and I really appreciate that.
[00:17:27.912 --> 00:17:28.773]  I love Bill Clinton.
[00:17:29.201 --> 00:17:31.682]  May all the Democrats forgive me this close to the election.
[00:17:31.702 --> 00:17:34.402]  I love George Bush.
[00:17:35.343 --> 00:17:35.703]  I do.
[00:17:37.003 --> 00:17:37.763]  So there you go.
[00:17:37.863 --> 00:17:46.186]  The Bush and Clinton crime families go all the way back to the 1980s and now even more recently with the rape of Haiti in 2010.
[00:17:46.226 --> 00:17:52.447]  So, and you know, like we're supposed to expect it's all going to change if Hillary becomes president.
[00:17:52.847 --> 00:17:53.848]  No way.
[00:17:54.188 --> 00:17:54.848]  It'll continue.
[00:17:55.328 --> 00:18:00.191]  Now, we're going to take a quick break right now, but when we come back, the MENA Connection will continue.
[00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:04.014]  We're going to have more on this as a very young Alex Jones.
[00:18:04.054 --> 00:18:05.895]  I think this is back in 2001.
[00:18:05.975 --> 00:18:14.641]  He interviews a former counterintelligence and CIA operative about his book, Compromised, Clinton, Bush, and the CIA.
[00:18:15.001 --> 00:18:16.162]  And you don't want to miss this.
[00:18:16.222 --> 00:18:25.108]  We are breaking the matrix and exposing the Clinton and Bush crime families when the InfoWars Nightly News returns right after this.
[00:18:25.128 --> 00:18:25.317]  Yes.
[00:18:41.476 --> 00:18:42.277]  Come on, Hillary.
[00:18:42.477 --> 00:18:43.058]  Just a little.
[00:18:43.358 --> 00:18:44.159]  Just a little sip.
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.000]  Open up.
[00:18:45.321 --> 00:18:46.222]  Come on, take it!
[00:18:46.703 --> 00:18:47.123]  Take it!
[00:18:47.504 --> 00:18:48.545]  I'm running for president.
[00:18:48.925 --> 00:18:52.129]  Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.
[00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:56.555]  I'm hitting the road to earn your vote, and I hope you'll join me on this journey.
[00:19:01.496 --> 00:19:04.659]  In the last 20 years, InfoWars has paid its dues.

[00:19:51.863 --> 00:19:55.208]  But Mother Nature is there to counter this onslaught.
[00:19:55.629 --> 00:20:03.660]  Everyone out there watching and listening to me owes it to themselves to give Mother Nature a try and to try super male or super female vitality.

[00:20:38.305 --> 00:20:39.686]  I know these formulas work.
[00:20:39.946 --> 00:20:40.727]  They've worked for me.
[00:20:41.007 --> 00:20:45.510]  But regardless, you're supporting the InfoWar in a historic, critical time.
[00:20:46.071 --> 00:20:52.636]  I also want to take some time out to thank all of you that have supported InfoWarsTore.com and who have gotten these products.
[00:20:52.836 --> 00:20:59.193]  So for myself and the rest of the InfoWars crew, I salute you for being on the side of life in the fight against the globalists.
[00:21:01.545 --> 00:21:02.906]  Hi, I'm Dr. David Jones.
[00:21:03.027 --> 00:21:05.969]  I've been in practice for over 30 years in dentistry.
[00:21:06.249 --> 00:21:09.993]  In our health histories, we've always asked what people's primary complaint were.
[00:21:10.013 --> 00:21:12.535]  A third of the time, it's, I want whiter teeth.
[00:21:12.995 --> 00:21:26.828]  In the early days of dentistry, we used some fairly harsh chemicals in order to bleach the teeth and whiten them, and people were happy with the results, even though it created hypersensitivity and some problems that I consider fairly high risk.
[00:21:27.148 --> 00:21:30.450]  Recently, I was exposed to the Ghost Smile System.
[00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:36.853]  It allows a whitening gel to be applied to the teeth with a very good ultrasonic toothbrush system.
[00:21:37.013 --> 00:21:52.220]  The gel is activated by a light-emitting diode, or actually two light-emitting diodes, so it's a simple and elegant procedure that delivers office-quality whitening, and you don't have to spend the $600 it typically costs for an in-office treatment.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.341]  In my opinion, it's the most elegant and best value that I've ever seen.
[00:21:56.561 --> 00:22:00.402]  To get your GoSmile system, go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:22:00.942 --> 00:22:02.322]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:22:02.602 --> 00:22:03.882]  You can't survive without it.
[00:22:04.082 --> 00:22:05.003]  But where do you get it?
[00:22:05.283 --> 00:22:11.044]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:22:11.264 --> 00:22:16.985]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:22:17.185 --> 00:22:34.046]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:22:34.446 --> 00:22:36.569]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:22:36.929 --> 00:22:38.131]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:22:38.391 --> 00:22:39.172]  Easy assembly.
[00:22:39.432 --> 00:22:40.053]  Low maintenance.
[00:22:40.353 --> 00:22:42.196]  Replacement filters are simple to install.
[00:22:42.416 --> 00:22:45.019]  Go to InfowarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:23:06.803 --> 00:23:15.750]  Did you know that a CIA contractor has gone public exposing Bill and Hillary Clinton's narcotics trafficking in Mena, Arkansas?
[00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:16.831]  That's right.
[00:23:16.891 --> 00:23:21.394]  His name is Terry Reid, best-selling author of Clinton, Bush, and the CIA.
[00:23:21.995 --> 00:23:23.636]  I interviewed him back in the year 2000.
[00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:42.214]  Mr. Reid wasn't just a CIA contractor, he was the head CIA contractor at MENA Arkansas, training pilots working with the Clintons and the Bushes to fly cocaine out of Central America into the United States and fly weapons back in for the Congress.
[00:23:42.614 --> 00:23:48.255]  This is more important than ever because it's the Clintons that got the mandatory sentencing rules changed.
[00:23:48.815 --> 00:23:55.839]  to give black Americans who use crack cocaine instead of powdered cocaine sentences of up to five times longer.
[00:23:56.539 --> 00:24:01.622]  Hillary Clinton herself has come out over and over again and said, look at what somebody tells you the first time.
[00:24:02.062 --> 00:24:03.162]  Look at what they stand for.
[00:24:03.723 --> 00:24:10.206]  Well, we know the Clintons what they stand for, and that's shipping narcotics into the United States that multinational banks launder.
[00:24:10.466 --> 00:24:17.430]  Now here's an excerpt from my film, Police State to the Takeover, shot in 2000 with CIA whistleblower, Terry Reid.
[00:24:18.237 --> 00:24:26.544]  Well, I came to the table with a background in Air Force Intelligence, eight years during the Vietnam War, worked with the CIA and Air America.
[00:24:27.225 --> 00:24:30.988]  And so I know how the intelligence community functions, how it's organized.
[00:24:31.068 --> 00:24:38.534]  And after my discharge from the Air Force, I worked directly with the FBI's Counterintelligence Division for three years.
[00:24:39.395 --> 00:24:42.177]  And then that led me into contract work with the CIA.
[00:24:43.562 --> 00:24:51.067]  In an obscure place called Mena, Arkansas, back when Bill Clinton was governor and back when George Bush was the president.
[00:24:52.228 --> 00:25:03.395]  And I personally witnessed a complicity between these two men, Bush and Clinton, in terms of transporting cocaine into the U.S.
[00:25:04.155 --> 00:25:06.597]  for the purpose of sale to generate money
[00:25:07.398 --> 00:25:16.340]  To fight a war, and that war at the time was the conflict in Central America involving the Sandinistas in Nicaragua.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:26.743]  In 1970, it's well documented that the organization that was flying the classified material for Air America, codenamed SCATMAC,
[00:25:27.905 --> 00:25:43.921]  Was busted this whole this whole fleet of airplanes and pilots was was busted for care hauling heroin Disguised as classified material in an attempt to smuggle that back to Hawaii and if you get to Hawaii Then it's a free ride
[00:25:44.654 --> 00:25:47.477]  Back to the United States, because that's part of the United States.
[00:25:47.517 --> 00:25:48.958]  There's no customs to clear.
[00:25:49.258 --> 00:26:04.233]  That is documented there, but back to the absolute documentation, tell us how you were involved in MENA with then-Governor Clinton of Arkansas and President Bush, who had also been director of the CIA earlier in the 70s.
[00:26:06.038 --> 00:26:07.419]  I met Oliver North in 1982.
[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.842]  He was with the National Security Council.
[00:26:11.382 --> 00:26:17.266]  He's the man who recruited me as a civilian to get involved in the Contra resupply operation.
[00:26:17.927 --> 00:26:33.318]  He told me that this was taking place in Mena, Arkansas, that George Bush was overseeing the entire project in order to insulate the executive branch from the scheme because certainly there were constitutional
[00:26:34.227 --> 00:26:35.308]  Considerations there.
[00:26:36.249 --> 00:26:37.050]  I went to mean it.
[00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:45.337]  I met a man named Barry seal who I was told was the CIA Contractor who had the contract to resupply the countries?
[00:26:46.418 --> 00:26:50.521]  Sure in fact I found a large base there under construction.
[00:26:51.482 --> 00:26:52.223]  I was hired and
[00:26:53.068 --> 00:26:55.070]  Initially to be a flight instructor.
[00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:57.031]  I'm a certified flight instructor.
[00:26:57.672 --> 00:27:04.417]  My last tour of duty in Southeast Asia was to assist the Cambodians and equip them to fight a covert war.
[00:27:05.197 --> 00:27:08.140]  And here we were doing basically the same kind of training.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:13.363]  This time we were equipping Nicaraguans to fight communism in Central America.
[00:27:14.084 --> 00:27:20.229]  And did you ever actually see the cocaine or you just were at the base and knew that it was being flown in?
[00:27:20.329 --> 00:27:21.570]  No, after
[00:27:22.586 --> 00:27:29.452]  After walking around with blinders on for two years, it became to the point I could no longer deny what was going on.
[00:27:30.113 --> 00:27:37.959]  And as I document and discuss in my book, Compromised, it's a book I wrote about this subject, Compromised Clinton, Bush, and the CIA.
[00:27:37.979 --> 00:27:40.061]  In 1987, I came face-to-face with a C-130 full of cocaine.
[00:27:44.924 --> 00:27:49.906]  Just literally tons of it stored in ammunition boxes on a flight that was returning.
[00:27:50.506 --> 00:27:53.847]  And from that point on, you know, I couldn't deny it.
[00:27:53.927 --> 00:28:01.190]  And I asked for a full-scale investigation and went directly to Oliver North, I might point out, to request for that to occur.
[00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.611]  And the investigation obviously didn't happen.
[00:28:05.511 --> 00:28:07.832]  I was labeled a security risk.
[00:28:08.692 --> 00:28:15.456]  And a threat to the operation, which clearly showed to me that this was being sponsored and sanctioned by the U.S.
[00:28:15.496 --> 00:28:15.796]  government.
[00:28:15.996 --> 00:28:18.318]  So they were flying guns out and cocaine?
[00:28:19.078 --> 00:28:19.879]  Yeah.
[00:28:20.279 --> 00:28:22.000]  I have no, I had no knowledge of that.
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:23.001]  It was cocaine.
[00:28:25.002 --> 00:28:26.383]  Where are we going now today?
[00:28:26.443 --> 00:28:34.348]  Would you say that the majority of, how big a percentile of the narcotics coming into this nation are controlled by the National Security Agency or the CIA?
[00:28:35.488 --> 00:28:38.270]  I have no way of knowing, but I use logic.
[00:28:38.971 --> 00:29:03.492]  On these kinds of scenarios, if you are to believe the Pentagon, and I do, we have a security net over this country down-looking satellites and radar that is designed to stop as small of an incoming target as an air-to-ground missile launch from a Soviet MiG out of Cuba.
[00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:15.518]  Now, if that's the case, and you can do that, and I believe we can do that, that's been proven time and time again we can, you have to ask yourself, how are all these drugs getting into this country?
[00:29:15.998 --> 00:29:17.499]  So what are the drug busts that we see?
[00:29:17.519 --> 00:29:23.023]  Are those cowboys, or people that were not inside, who are not licensed drug runners for the CIA being busted?
[00:29:23.944 --> 00:29:33.190]  Oh, the independent entrepreneurs, the little guys, the guys with a Cessna that gets caught with a duffel bag full and goes to prison for life.
[00:29:33.829 --> 00:29:40.459]  The juxtaposition of that is a C-123 with five tons coming in unabated.
[00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:41.600]  How do we stop this?
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.322]  Just education?
[00:29:43.103 --> 00:29:43.283]  No.
[00:29:43.603 --> 00:29:47.990]  We the American people, first of all, say we don't want a war on drugs.
[00:29:48.691 --> 00:29:50.013]  I'm for total legalization.
[00:29:50.814 --> 00:29:51.314]  Of drugs.
[00:29:51.394 --> 00:29:58.318]  Well, some people will be shocked by that, but back in the 1920s during Prohibition, alcohol abuse skyrocketed.
[00:29:58.358 --> 00:30:00.059]  It created giant armed gangs.
[00:30:00.119 --> 00:30:03.942]  If you make something illegal and risque, a giant black market rises.
[00:30:04.182 --> 00:30:06.183]  Well, black market is what the problem is.
[00:30:06.243 --> 00:30:07.304]  The profits are there.
[00:30:07.784 --> 00:30:08.744]  Take the profit out.
[00:30:09.085 --> 00:30:10.966]  And then it loses the flair and it loses the money.
[00:30:11.266 --> 00:30:17.930]  Not only does it lose that, but anybody else still in the trade certainly surfaces as a cold sore, real abruptly.
[00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:19.811]  The banks that launder the money,
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.541]  It would surface and probably go bankrupt.
[00:30:22.661 --> 00:30:33.824]  It'd be interesting as an experiment, I've always said, to, let's say we're not going to do this permanently, but for three months, for 90 days, we're going to have a test.
[00:30:34.625 --> 00:30:36.325]  And we're going to legalize cocaine.
[00:30:36.345 --> 00:30:37.366]  Do you remember?
[00:30:37.426 --> 00:30:38.026]  For 90 days.
[00:30:38.466 --> 00:30:49.970]  And just see the reaction of corporations, companies, big businesses that are in the drug business, and banks that launder their proceeds, and watch them surface, because they could not, they would go into withdrawal.
[00:30:51.152 --> 00:30:51.893]  Real abruptly.
[00:30:52.053 --> 00:30:55.236]  Well, Mr. Reid, just two more short questions, and I appreciate your time with us here today.
[00:30:58.418 --> 00:31:02.762]  The general public has a gut-level feeling that the information you're discussing is true.
[00:31:03.242 --> 00:31:13.671]  Even Esquire did a large article two months ago about it in their September issue, documenting it, DEA people, carte blanche admitting it.
[00:31:15.254 --> 00:31:21.116]  And we've seen articles in early 97 about the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and San Antonio being caught with three billion dollars of drug money.
[00:31:21.856 --> 00:31:23.237]  This goes to the highest levels.
[00:31:24.817 --> 00:31:27.698]  Truthfully, it's good to say we should decriminalize drugs.
[00:31:28.078 --> 00:31:32.780]  At the same point, isn't the war on drugs also creating the police state that they like?
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.560]  That's my greatest concern.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:38.782]  I don't say let's legalize drugs because I want to see you use drugs or anybody else.
[00:31:39.962 --> 00:31:41.463]  We have not had a war on drugs.
[00:31:41.483 --> 00:31:42.183]  We've had a war...
[00:31:43.118 --> 00:31:45.080]  In my view, Hillary and Bill's Achilles heel.
[00:32:08.138 --> 00:32:17.069]  Is the fact that they're really cold-blooded CIA arms and drug traffickers who could care less about black people, white people, you name it.
[00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:27.241]  And that's why we're releasing this September surprise in hopes that Americans investigate the very, very wicked past of this dynamic duo.
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:35.188]  InfoWars has more information coming out in the days and weeks that exposes this Bonnie and Clyde's criminal activities.
[00:32:35.569 --> 00:32:38.032]  But this is a very important September surprise.
[00:32:39.033 --> 00:32:47.083]  We need to get all Americans, people around the world quite frankly, to look into the history of this dangerous criminal combine that is the Clintons.
[00:33:02.526 --> 00:33:07.990]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:09.031]  Unveiled!
[00:33:09.431 --> 00:33:12.493]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula.
[00:33:13.174 --> 00:33:13.634]  30 servings.
[00:33:13.834 --> 00:33:16.436]  Fruit punch flavor dietary supplement.
[00:33:16.736 --> 00:33:17.797]  It is simply amazing.
[00:33:17.857 --> 00:33:18.818]  Infowarslife.com
[00:33:19.198 --> 00:33:23.600]  There's a million different products like this out there, but they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:37.227]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all of the essential amino acids, all of the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:38.808]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:40.029]  I put it in my protein shake.
[00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:46.133]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:49.175]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:51.456]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[00:33:52.057 --> 00:33:58.201]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:00.783]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[00:34:01.143 --> 00:34:03.004]  Okay, this... Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:05.346]  Yeah, this... I wanna... But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:05.726]  Yeah.
[00:34:05.946 --> 00:34:07.447]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:10.349]  There's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com that are excellent.
[00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:11.909]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.152]  This is just the very best we can bring you, and when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:39.919]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body, because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:41.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:41.087 --> 00:34:44.228]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[00:34:44.328 --> 00:34:45.568]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:46.168]  Tell folks about that.
[00:34:46.328 --> 00:34:49.088]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.589]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:55.670]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine.
[00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.510]  Each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.131]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:04.691]  34 other ones you can check out.
[00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.731]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:09.552]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:19.939]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just by the way look on the other side too because we're showing people the minerals and things let's look at the vitamins right there old Scott in there I mean it's amazing.
[00:35:19.979 --> 00:35:20.440]  Top left.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.862]  Again if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.285]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's the other source?
[00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.707]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:32.806]  Retinol.
[00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:37.328]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[00:35:37.649 --> 00:35:38.049]  And you know what?
[00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:40.290]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.110]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:48.154]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:53.997]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:55.358]  So get them today!

[00:36:00.442 --> 00:36:01.983]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:36:02.363 --> 00:36:08.288]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[00:36:08.508 --> 00:36:09.649]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:25.219]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:29.582]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:36:33.604 --> 00:36:40.690]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:36:41.031 --> 00:36:46.696]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:36:46.896 --> 00:36:53.022]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.

[00:37:04.775 --> 00:37:11.876]  Why is the mainstream media calling the rioters in Charlotte, North Carolina, protesters?
[00:37:12.456 --> 00:37:13.937]  These aren't protesters.
[00:37:14.037 --> 00:37:17.077]  These are agitators and criminal thugs.
[00:37:17.717 --> 00:37:33.380]  After the shooting of an armed black man by the name of Keith Lamott Scott, who was shot, by the way, by a black police officer, rioters once again jumped to conclusions and went crazy before hearing all of the facts.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:39.306]  But hey, once they do learn all of the facts, you can bet that the riots will continue.
[00:37:39.946 --> 00:37:43.610]  Because facts don't matter to Black Lives Matter.
[00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:45.192]  Joe Biggs joins us now.
[00:37:45.232 --> 00:37:47.294]  He's en route to Charlotte, North Carolina.
[00:37:47.675 --> 00:37:49.537]  Joe, what's the latest on the riot situation?
[00:37:50.417 --> 00:37:56.584]  Hey, I just landed in Charlotte, and you know, from what a lot of people have told me so far, that live in the uptown area,
[00:37:56.983 --> 00:37:57.183]  Is it?
[00:37:57.203 --> 00:37:58.704]  It kind of looks like the Gaza Strip.
[00:37:58.764 --> 00:38:00.465]  I mean, the National Guard's in town.
[00:38:00.745 --> 00:38:02.526]  They're actually checking people's IDs.
[00:38:02.846 --> 00:38:09.510]  If you don't actually live in that uptown area or have proof that you work in that area, you're not allowed to be out there.
[00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:14.112]  But the thing is, no one's going to be there tonight rioting anyways.
[00:38:14.252 --> 00:38:20.115]  Everyone's going to the rich, white neighborhood where most of the NFL players live, which is called South Park Meadows.
[00:38:20.476 --> 00:38:22.997]  And that's where I'm going to be focusing most of my attention tonight.
[00:38:23.902 --> 00:38:33.505]  Well, I know there's been reports, and we've seen the violent unrest, looting, attacking bystanders, they're attacking journalists, they're setting fires, you know, the usual suspects.
[00:38:33.865 --> 00:38:46.950]  They're smashing up cars, smashing up businesses, and shooting at each other, but the media is still describing these criminal thugs behind the rampage as protesters, and hey, I've got news for all you protesters.
[00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:49.611]  Martin Luther King would be ashamed.
[00:38:50.791 --> 00:38:51.812]  Yeah, they're not protesters.
[00:38:51.832 --> 00:38:52.852]  When you're burning down
[00:38:53.444 --> 00:39:01.288]  Your city, when you're demolishing jobs, when you're destroying people's livelihoods, when you're attacking people and assaulting people, you are a terrorist.
[00:39:02.308 --> 00:39:05.690]  All right, well look, I want to tell our audience just to stay tuned for updates.
[00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:09.412]  You will be reporting tonight and putting out reports on Infowars.com.
[00:39:09.772 --> 00:39:18.096]  Also, check out the Alex Jones channel on YouTube and the official Alexander Emmerich Jones Facebook page.
[00:39:18.316 --> 00:39:19.697]  Joe Biggs, you got the last word.
[00:39:20.609 --> 00:39:27.273]  I will be using Alex's Facebook mentions tonight, and I will be posting videos to YouTube and stuff on my Twitter.
[00:39:27.353 --> 00:39:29.395]  So live coverage as well?
[00:39:29.415 --> 00:39:29.515]  Yep.
[00:39:29.535 --> 00:39:29.995]  That's right.
[00:39:30.015 --> 00:39:32.076]  Stay tuned for more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:39:32.237 --> 00:39:34.758]  I'm Joe Biggs from Charlotte, North Carolina.
[00:39:34.938 --> 00:39:35.399]  Alright, buddy.
[00:39:35.419 --> 00:39:36.179]  Stay safe out there.
[00:39:36.399 --> 00:39:36.659]  Alright.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.100]  Later, dude.
[00:39:45.982 --> 00:39:51.025]  Article up on InfoWars.com right now by Clifford Cunningham.
[00:39:51.905 --> 00:39:56.627]  New York bomber tied to CIA's al-Awlaki.
[00:39:57.088 --> 00:40:09.334]  That's right, Ahmad Khan Romani's manifesto actually praised the known CIA asset Anwar al-Awlaki, as well as numerous trips
[00:40:09.714 --> 00:40:12.135]  to Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[00:40:12.475 --> 00:40:16.097]  This is breaking news right now on InfoWars.com.
[00:40:16.437 --> 00:40:30.644]  This manifesto that Rahmani actually posted ended up mentioning the Boston bombing as well as Yemeni-American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was the first U.S.
[00:40:30.684 --> 00:40:34.006]  citizen to actually be killed by a U.S.
[00:40:34.046 --> 00:40:36.267]  drone strike when he was in Yemen.
[00:40:36.947 --> 00:40:45.915]  Al-Awlaki, he was a known CIA and FBI asset who dined at the Pentagon shortly after 9-11.
[00:40:46.776 --> 00:40:57.546]  He directly inspired the Chattanooga shooter, the Fort Hood shooter, the underwear bomber, as well as the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks.
[00:40:58.427 --> 00:41:04.929]  Paul Joseph Watson called him the chief terrorist pansy handler for the CIA.
[00:41:05.269 --> 00:41:09.430]  He is the federal government's premier false flag agent.
[00:41:09.871 --> 00:41:20.394]  So what we have here is a situation where the New York bomber is actually tied to someone who is deeply involved in trying to destroy America.
[00:41:20.814 --> 00:41:27.798]  When he was living, he was the chief terrorist and he continues to inspire despite his death.
[00:41:28.238 --> 00:41:31.720]  It's very, very shocking and it's very, very disturbing.
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:36.543]  Now, I agree with Trump when he says that we need to have extreme vetting.
[00:41:36.903 --> 00:41:51.674]  There's another article up today on Infowars.com where actually Donald Trump is being lambasted by CNN for saying that he wants to vet all the people who are coming into America.
[00:41:51.954 --> 00:41:53.275]  The fact of the matter is this.
[00:41:53.435 --> 00:42:01.978]  If you don't vet people, then how will you know if they're friends of America or if they're coming here to actually destroy our country?
[00:42:02.118 --> 00:42:15.965]  If you do not actually go forth and look for people who do have ties to terrorists and who are ready to destroy America, then how are you actually going to protect the security of America?
[00:42:16.265 --> 00:42:17.905]  Hillary Clinton does not want that.
[00:42:18.166 --> 00:42:21.127]  Hillary Clinton wants to double, triple, quadruple
[00:42:21.627 --> 00:42:29.075]  The amount of terrorists, the amount of unvetted refugees, quote refugees, that are coming into America.
[00:42:29.455 --> 00:42:32.859]  She wants to be the Angela Merkel of America.
[00:42:33.259 --> 00:42:34.180]  I'm not with her.
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:40.747]  I want you to go ahead and check out this special report by Clifford Cunningham on InfoWars.com.
[00:42:41.147 --> 00:42:44.851]  In order to stay up to date, we've actually created a new app.

[00:43:06.258 --> 00:43:13.693]  Just go ahead and download InfoWars.com and stay tuned for more special reports.
[00:43:13.973 --> 00:43:16.879]  This is Ashley Beckford for InfoWars.com.
[00:43:25.771 --> 00:43:27.893]  I'm Margaret Halver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:43:27.913 --> 00:43:34.598]  Well, if you want to know about all the countries that Hillary Clinton has single-handedly destroyed, look no further than our website, InfoWars.com.
[00:43:34.618 --> 00:43:38.441]  There's an article up online, right now it's trending, written by Wayne Madsen.
[00:43:38.481 --> 00:43:43.925]  Wayne's going to be on Alex Jones Show later today and then the nightly news tonight with Owen Schroer.
[00:43:44.005 --> 00:43:45.547]  I want to take you through what he said.
[00:43:45.587 --> 00:43:48.909]  I encourage you to take a look at this 11-page article in its entirety.
[00:43:48.949 --> 00:43:49.630]  It's amazing.
[00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:53.653]  It's entitled, Here's a Handy Chart of Clinton's World Destruction.
[00:43:53.693 --> 00:43:54.994]  And then he goes on to write about what
[00:43:55.214 --> 00:43:55.774]  We're good to go.
[00:44:21.067 --> 00:44:21.167]  We're
[00:44:36.773 --> 00:44:38.974]  That is on a major power trip right now.
[00:44:39.054 --> 00:44:43.617]  She wants the highest office in our land, and yet look at her track record.
[00:44:43.677 --> 00:44:45.978]  She screws up everything she touches.
[00:44:46.018 --> 00:44:53.061]  Can you only imagine the foreign policy regime that we're going to have if she gets her hands on the keys to the White House?
[00:44:53.101 --> 00:45:01.266]  Now, Wayne Mattson goes on to talk about how Clinton's involvement in the Arab Spring resulted in the rise of Sunni Wahhabism and the Islamic State.
[00:45:01.366 --> 00:45:03.347]  Basically, she had a hand in the creation of ISIS.
[00:45:04.207 --> 00:45:08.590]  in northern and western Iraq and Iraq's plunge and dissension into hell.
[00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:21.399]  He goes on to talk about in 2009 her involvement in Kosovo, which led to the state increasingly becoming a state ruled by criminal syndicates and terrorists and former Liberation Army officials, which we know were basically terrorists.
[00:45:21.899 --> 00:45:23.980]  So we need to take a look at Hillary Clinton's record.
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:26.982]  She has a lengthy past full of crimes.
[00:45:27.102 --> 00:45:29.744]  I encourage you, go to our website, take a look at this article.
[00:45:30.024 --> 00:45:31.685]  While you're at it, download our app.
[00:45:32.166 --> 00:45:34.067]  Infowars.com forward slash app.
[00:45:34.669 --> 00:45:37.340]  I'm Margaret Hal reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:45:45.765 --> 00:45:53.009]  Right now on InfoWars.com, Hillary Clinton has denied any need for a neurocognitive test.
[00:45:53.609 --> 00:45:58.272]  ABC reporter Serena Fazan asked Hillary Clinton if she would take a neurocognitive test.
[00:45:58.972 --> 00:46:05.356]  The first time Hillary Clinton responded awkwardly by saying, you know, I'm very sorry I got pneumonia.
[00:46:05.976 --> 00:46:10.239]  A strange response to being asked if you need a neurocognitive test.
[00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:15.583]  Now, when she was asked again, she said there's no need for that.
[00:46:16.024 --> 00:46:18.846]  Now, Serena Fazon might just be looking out for Hillary's health.
[00:46:18.866 --> 00:46:26.071]  This is a regular thing for women of her age that have experienced the things that we've seen her experience, but she says there's no need.
[00:46:26.371 --> 00:46:30.194]  And then she even cites her health records, how they were released.
[00:46:30.574 --> 00:46:35.258]  But you know, Hillary, in case you didn't notice, there were multiple doctors that came out and questioned
[00:46:35.738 --> 00:46:36.839]  Thank you for having me.

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.244 --> 00:48:52.724]  I don't know.
[00:49:04.392 --> 00:49:11.679]  Owen Schroer from InfoWars.com and I am joined by Wayne Madsen of WayneMadsenReport.com, also of InfoWars.com.
[00:49:12.139 --> 00:49:21.207]  Now, Wayne, you put out a scathing article on InfoWars.com today detailing Hillary's destruction around the entire planet.
[00:49:22.729 --> 00:49:30.576]  Briefly, just tell us about the overall arching kind of spectacle that you've seen with Hillary Clinton involved around the world.
[00:49:31.837 --> 00:49:41.821]  Well, she's on the same level with Henry Kissinger and Madeleine Albright as being one of the three worst secretaries of state in U.S.
[00:49:41.861 --> 00:49:42.361]  history.
[00:49:42.822 --> 00:49:46.863]  And that, of course, covers many years.
[00:49:47.744 --> 00:49:53.166]  But I looked at, you know, we saw Obama at the U.N.
[00:49:53.286 --> 00:49:55.147]  talking about all these trouble spots.
[00:49:55.567 --> 00:49:58.768]  These were trouble spots created by Hillary Clinton's
[00:50:01.488 --> 00:50:03.669]  Terrible policies of Secretary of State.
[00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:15.455]  Her regime change, which she called responsibility to protect, resulted in failed states in Ukraine, in Syria, in Libya, in Yemen.
[00:50:16.616 --> 00:50:21.158]  It furthered the destruction and dismemberment of Iraq.
[00:50:21.638 --> 00:50:27.602]  I mean, that started with Bush, but was continued because of Clinton's bad policies.
[00:50:28.182 --> 00:50:30.083]  And we've seen
[00:50:31.241 --> 00:50:33.123]  A coup d'etat in Honduras.
[00:50:33.964 --> 00:50:44.353]  She wasn't even secretary for very long before she authorized the military overthrow of the democratically elected president of Honduras.
[00:50:44.813 --> 00:50:50.218]  And that was followed by more chicanery and skullduggery throughout Latin America.
[00:50:51.067 --> 00:50:55.890]  Yeah, and speaking of Latin America and South America, let's go case-by-case on some of these.
[00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:59.612]  In Argentina, you know, and these are her foreign policies.
[00:50:59.632 --> 00:51:03.634]  It's very important that people know that these are her foreign policies that caused this.
[00:51:04.214 --> 00:51:19.663]  There was fomenting of political and labor protests that caused uprising and eventually what was an economy on the rise is now once again back in a collapsed state and now they're trying to pay off the IMF and they can't afford to, Wayne.
[00:51:20.643 --> 00:51:21.484]  That's right.
[00:51:21.684 --> 00:51:46.806]  Argentina has a bad history of being under the dictates of the IMF and World Bank and once again because she undermined the Christina Fernandez Kirchner government and her successor lost the re-election and probably one of the Soros-engineered
[00:51:47.301 --> 00:51:48.561]  I don't know.
[00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:21.631]  Also in Ecuador, the country was starting to blossom.
[00:52:21.671 --> 00:52:32.396]  People were starting to experience some wealth being shared throughout the citizens and then Hillary Clinton came in and a police co-op came down and then the economy collapsed.
[00:52:32.576 --> 00:52:38.238]  Another example of a Hillary Clinton foreign policy leading to destruction in another country.
[00:52:38.958 --> 00:52:41.499]  Yeah, there was revenue sharing.
[00:52:41.799 --> 00:52:43.400]  Ecuador is an oil producer.
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:45.461]  The country is very poor.
[00:52:46.317 --> 00:52:53.499]  Indigenous peoples of that country were starting to benefit from this revenue sharing under President Correa.
[00:52:53.559 --> 00:53:07.803]  But again, Hillary Clinton started to foment rebellions in Ecuador, labor strife, almost saw a police coup against the democratically elected President Correa.
[00:53:08.143 --> 00:53:15.165]  And now Ecuador has got a faltering economy, again, thanks to Hillary Clinton's terrible
[00:53:17.938 --> 00:53:26.460]  And one of the worst people for when we talk about this is George Soros.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:32.461]  This is somebody that Hillary Clinton has worked hand-in-hand with and one of the biggest examples I think is the Arab Spring.
[00:53:32.581 --> 00:53:42.083]  Obviously this took up a lot of countries but I think Egypt is perhaps the best and most clear example where now we're seeing radical regime change which Hillary Clinton supported.
[00:53:43.226 --> 00:53:48.607]  Yeah, so under Hillary Clinton we saw the Mubarak government overthrown.
[00:53:48.647 --> 00:53:52.088]  Now look, that wasn't a great government, but it was secular in nature.
[00:53:53.548 --> 00:54:01.769]  There was a lot of religious freedom in Egypt, especially with the minority Christian Copts.
[00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:12.471]  But now, what happened after Mubarak was ousted, we saw the Muslim Brotherhood, a bunch of jihadists under Mohammed Morsi take control.
[00:54:13.395 --> 00:54:26.382]  They started to islamicize the country, the military reacted, and now Egypt is a military dictatorship with a lot of problems, especially among the poor people of Egypt.
[00:54:27.282 --> 00:54:28.823]  They haven't seen any progress.
[00:54:29.183 --> 00:54:30.764]  Again, this is all Hillary's fault.
[00:54:30.864 --> 00:54:32.525]  Let's call for what it is.
[00:54:33.285 --> 00:54:38.828]  This didn't happen under Condoleezza Rice, and she wasn't a very good Secretary of State either.
[00:54:39.548 --> 00:54:41.069]  This happened under Hillary Clinton.
[00:54:41.417 --> 00:54:55.890]  And John Kerry, of course, is continuing a lot of these terrible policies because he kept in place many of Hillary's assistant secretaries and other top officials in the State Department.
[00:54:56.448 --> 00:54:59.470]  Yeah, and it's very important that we hold these people accountable.
[00:54:59.951 --> 00:55:08.818]  Much like Merkel in Germany, Merkel is starting to have to retract some of her stances and admit that she regrets it, and then maybe she doesn't, she wants to be tolerant.
[00:55:09.178 --> 00:55:20.246]  But what we're seeing in Germany is a collapsed state, where they're bringing in all these refugees and now they're losing a lot of their culture, a lot of their heritage, and people are getting raped in the streets, if you want to be graphic about it.
[00:55:21.047 --> 00:55:27.051]  I think that, to me, Hillary Clinton kind of reminds me of Merkel as far as her domestic policy is concerned.
[00:55:27.951 --> 00:55:29.572]  Oh, well, domestic and foreign.
[00:55:29.592 --> 00:55:31.974]  They're both incompetent leaders.
[00:55:32.034 --> 00:55:33.215]  Let's call it for what it is.
[00:55:33.275 --> 00:55:34.575]  People say, oh, that's sexist.
[00:55:35.036 --> 00:55:36.477]  You just don't want women leaders.
[00:55:36.537 --> 00:55:41.680]  Look, I just mentioned one female leader, Christina Kirchner in Argentina.
[00:55:42.031 --> 00:55:43.431]  She was a successful leader.
[00:55:43.471 --> 00:55:52.754]  She helped spur that country's economy and then Hillary worked against her and ultimately her political party was thrown out of power.
[00:55:53.434 --> 00:55:59.055]  President Dilma Rousseff in Brazil was ousted in a constitutional coup.
[00:55:59.795 --> 00:56:05.517]  Much of those problems were set in motion while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.
[00:56:05.837 --> 00:56:11.398]  So all these people who charge that criticism of Merkel
[00:56:11.883 --> 00:56:13.464]  And Hillary is sexist.
[00:56:13.805 --> 00:56:25.715]  Why is it that Hillary Clinton did so much to destroy two successful women presidents in South America, Rousseff and Fernandez de Kirchner?
[00:56:26.095 --> 00:56:29.738]  And, you know, I mean, they can't have it both ways.
[00:56:30.579 --> 00:56:35.103]  But I would, again, I would suggest Merkel and Hillary Clinton are incompetent.
[00:56:35.443 --> 00:56:37.525]  It doesn't matter whether they're women or not.
[00:56:37.765 --> 00:56:38.826]  They shouldn't
[00:56:40.575 --> 00:56:40.956]  Thank you.
[00:56:56.164 --> 00:57:13.370]  And I think perhaps Haiti might be the worst example that I've ever seen of a foundation, the Clinton Foundation, taking advantage of a really sad scenario, a country that is in desperate need of help, and then they use people's emotions to basically get rich.
[00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:14.911]  I mean, that's what they did to Haiti.
[00:57:15.191 --> 00:57:18.812]  I don't want to get off on that because InfoWars has reported on that a lot of times, but you know,
[00:57:19.472 --> 00:57:39.326]  Real quick, Wayne, just looking at these foreign policies and looking at some of the things that she's fomented in other countries and looking where America is right now, I think it's very important for Americans to look at these foreign policies, what has happened in the other countries since these foreign policies have come down, and start looking within to think, is this really what we want from a future president to happen here?
[00:57:39.346 --> 00:57:41.888]  No, absolutely not.
[00:57:42.609 --> 00:57:47.252]  Everything that happened happened while she was only the Secretary of State.
[00:57:47.705 --> 00:57:56.652]  Of course, Obama went along with a lot of this stuff because he's been a pretty detached president, allowing members of his cabinet to do all kinds of things.
[00:57:56.692 --> 00:57:59.455]  He later says, I wouldn't have done it that way.
[00:57:59.515 --> 00:58:02.157]  I mean, that shows you his managerial skills.
[00:58:02.617 --> 00:58:10.844]  I would just hope that Donald Trump and his advisers read this article because Trump is always hit on not having specifics.
[00:58:11.257 --> 00:58:24.962]  But if he can actually demonstrate where Hillary Clinton has destroyed countries as Secretary of State and made the world a much dangerous place, she has no defense for her past actions, believe me.
[00:58:25.222 --> 00:58:26.682]  She can't defend that record.
[00:58:26.962 --> 00:58:33.745]  But at least there's a record to point to, unlike just, you know, using generalities to go after her.
[00:58:33.825 --> 00:58:37.206]  These are very specific points and that's why I wrote the article.
[00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:42.192]  Wayne Madsen of WayneMadsenReport.com, investigative reporter for InfoWars.com.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.930]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:20.115]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.435 --> 00:59:24.176]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.737 --> 00:59:27.578]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.779 --> 00:59:36.003]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
