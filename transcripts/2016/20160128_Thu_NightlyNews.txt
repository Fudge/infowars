[00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.052]  We're good to go.
[00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.971]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:42.112]  It is Thursday, January 28, 2016, and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:42.353 --> 00:00:43.373]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:52.897]  Tonight, the return of Political Science Theater 3K.
[00:00:52.977 --> 00:00:57.059]  Trump dumps Fox in favor of his own event.
[00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:04.181]  Our cameras will roll on the Donald, as well as real-time debate analysis from the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:07.411]  That's next.
[00:01:46.624 --> 00:01:47.985]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:49.567]  You can't survive without it.
[00:01:49.747 --> 00:01:50.668]  But where do you get it?
[00:01:50.968 --> 00:01:56.733]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand-new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:01:56.953 --> 00:02:02.699]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:10.626]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities.
[00:02:13.388 --> 00:02:19.712]  Including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:20.112 --> 00:02:22.254]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:02:22.594 --> 00:02:23.795]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:02:24.075 --> 00:02:24.856]  Easy assembly.
[00:02:25.116 --> 00:02:25.736]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:26.016 --> 00:02:27.857]  Replacement filters are simple to install.
[00:02:28.118 --> 00:02:31.620]  And now, as part of an exclusive limited time introductory offer,

[00:02:50.382 --> 00:02:51.883]  Will he or won't he?
[00:02:52.003 --> 00:02:54.305]  That is the question everyone is asking.
[00:02:54.705 --> 00:02:59.448]  Donald Trump has set up his own event where he is set to raise money for veterans.
[00:02:59.948 --> 00:03:03.270]  He is going to skip the Fox debate altogether.
[00:03:03.651 --> 00:03:06.633]  This is apparently due to a rift he's having with Megyn Kelly.
[00:03:07.293 --> 00:03:11.417]  The frontrunner for the Republican nomination is going to be hosting his own event in Iowa.
[00:03:11.878 --> 00:03:15.902]  He says that the Fox News debate is going to be a total disaster.
[00:03:16.242 --> 00:03:18.664]  It's likely going to damage their primetime TV ratings.
[00:03:18.985 --> 00:03:23.449]  And of course, Fox News is the most powerful force in Republican politics.
[00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.952]  A lot of people are saying that this is a risky move.
[00:03:25.992 --> 00:03:28.694]  It could cost him votes at Monday's Iowa caucuses.
[00:03:29.455 --> 00:03:34.880]  And this is of course the first nominating contest in the November 8th presidential election.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.504]  Now a lot of networks are going to be streaming Trump's event live.
[00:03:41.125 --> 00:03:46.789]  We will as well, we're going to be having our own live stream set up there on the ground in Iowa.
[00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:47.610]  You can watch that
[00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.351]  I think so.
[00:04:03.894 --> 00:04:15.542]  Now a lot of people that are going to be on the stage tonight have said that Donald Trump is just a big chicken and he doesn't want to show up to the debate because he's too afraid to face them over some of these more important issues.
[00:04:15.943 --> 00:04:26.710]  People like Ted Cruz, they're sort of taking this as an opportunity to really bash him, which of course doesn't ever end up looking too good for them because of course Trump isn't there to defend himself.
[00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:31.694]  So it'll be really interesting to see how these two live events play against each other.
[00:04:31.774 --> 00:04:32.855]  So be sure to stick around.
[00:04:33.435 --> 00:04:41.558]  Myself, Jakari Jackson, as well as Alex Jones are going to be right here in studio giving you our live debate coverage and analysis.
[00:04:42.378 --> 00:04:55.043]  But the thing that's sort of funny, Fox News released a statement, Trump said this is super childish, but they sent out a statement basically saying how is Trump going to handle President Putin or Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah
[00:04:55.803 --> 00:04:58.425]  If he can't even deal with Megyn Kelly.
[00:04:58.845 --> 00:05:09.272]  So this is Trump saying this is basically childish and what he's proving, which Fox News seems to fail to realize, is that he doesn't need to deal with the establishment.
[00:05:09.572 --> 00:05:11.574]  This is an unprecedented time to be alive.
[00:05:11.914 --> 00:05:15.096]  He's basically saying you are not the gatekeepers anymore.
[00:05:15.216 --> 00:05:17.477]  You are not going to be the ones who are choosing the candidates.
[00:05:17.858 --> 00:05:23.982]  Rand Paul underscored this fact with the last debate that he decided to boycott and he did his own thing.
[00:05:24.822 --> 00:05:29.544]  On Periscope and was the top trending thing on Twitter, everyone said he won the debate and he wasn't even there.
[00:05:30.004 --> 00:05:31.264]  So this is unprecedented.
[00:05:31.544 --> 00:05:39.907]  We've been telling you that the dinosaur media is dying and here, you know, with this election, it's really, it is really unprecedented what is happening.
[00:05:40.047 --> 00:05:41.807]  What a time to be alive.
[00:05:42.188 --> 00:05:48.630]  Now something else that's very interesting is some other candidates that you probably didn't even know were running because they have been on the JV
[00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.211]  Squad there for a while.
[00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:55.194]  Huckabee and Santorum, they have now aligned with Trump.
[00:05:55.234 --> 00:05:59.017]  They are going to be attending his event during this Fox News debate.
[00:05:59.377 --> 00:06:04.401]  Now, both of these guys were winners of the Iowa caucuses in the past.
[00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:07.063]  So Iowa took a liking to these guys.
[00:06:07.563 --> 00:06:14.409]  And this is basically going to be a win-win for all involved, because it's going to give both of them more attention than they've gotten in the past.
[00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:20.651]  Um, it also lets people know that they support what Trump is doing with skipping this debate.
[00:06:21.031 --> 00:06:27.974]  But it's also going to help shift the tension away from Senator Ted Cruz, who right now is Trump's main competitor in this race.
[00:06:28.294 --> 00:06:32.576]  And of course, Cruz is the candidate who is appealing to the evangelical voters.
[00:06:33.236 --> 00:06:37.417]  And these are the evangelical voters who actually helped Huckabee win in 2008.
[00:06:37.477 --> 00:06:37.998]  So this is all
[00:06:39.358 --> 00:06:46.301]  Pretty intelligent what's going on here, what's happening, and of course it's going to be interesting to watch it all unfold live.
[00:06:46.941 --> 00:07:00.166]  Now, in another scandal, the FBI says they are not letting up on Hillary Clinton's email investigation, and of course this is causing a lot of Democrats to be really nervous if she gets the nomination.
[00:07:00.786 --> 00:07:03.207]  This hat could drop for her at any time.
[00:07:03.667 --> 00:07:18.172]  So the former FBI officials said that the length of this probe is not unusual, and they speculated that a decision on whether to file charges against Clinton or her top aides could come later this year, but of course that would be during the heat of the general election campaign.
[00:07:18.192 --> 00:07:29.816]  But they said they're not playing politics, they don't even care about politics, they're worried on this investigation, whereas the Clinton campaign is saying that this is all just a vast right-wing conspiracy to take her down.
[00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:36.280]  This is, of course, giving pause to Democrats who are concerned about making her the nominee.
[00:07:37.021 --> 00:07:49.949]  Obviously, it's going to be a topic in the general election if she is going to get the nomination, but it's also going to weaken Democratic enthusiasm, and it's absolutely going to turn off those swing voters who are undecided either way.
[00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:55.453]  If Hillary Clinton is constantly having to dodge these questions about being a liar and a cheat,
[00:07:56.013 --> 00:07:56.313]  I don't know.
[00:08:19.694 --> 00:08:24.499]  They might be the one who actually take the fall for Hillary Clinton.
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.963]  So that's going to be pretty interesting as well.
[00:08:28.003 --> 00:08:29.244]  We'll be watching that unfold.
[00:08:29.785 --> 00:08:33.408]  And also something else to be looking out for with the caucuses coming up next week.
[00:08:33.749 --> 00:08:40.155]  The Sanders camp says they are super suspicious of Microsoft's influence in the Iowa caucus.
[00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:46.355]  Now, it's just days away, and this is the campaign of Bernie Sanders.
[00:08:46.755 --> 00:08:49.056]  They're raising questions about Microsoft's involvement.
[00:08:49.416 --> 00:08:55.757]  For the first time this year, Microsoft has partnered with both the Iowa Democrats and Republican parties.
[00:08:56.117 --> 00:09:01.178]  They've provided them a technological platform that the parties are going to use to run their caucuses.
[00:09:01.698 --> 00:09:07.019]  It's an app that will allow each party to tabulate the votes.
[00:09:07.159 --> 00:09:07.579]  We're good to go.
[00:09:31.644 --> 00:09:32.285]  Hello!
[00:09:32.765 --> 00:09:38.690]  Isn't that ironic, considering Sanders is running his entire campaign on giving away stuff for free?
[00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:41.552]  So, nothing is for free.
[00:09:41.852 --> 00:09:50.619]  Apparently, you can't trust a giant corporation that wants to hand you stuff for free, but you can trust a giant government under Bernie Sanders, right?
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.342]  So, we're all just supposed to suspend our disbelief.
[00:09:53.882 --> 00:09:59.485]  Now, I'm sure one topic that's going to be on the mind of every voter this election cycle is the economy.
[00:09:59.985 --> 00:10:07.510]  And Harry Dent was actually on the Alex Jones Show today, and Alex decided to challenge two top economists with this question.
[00:10:09.232 --> 00:10:13.994]  Max Keiser, another smart guy, made a lot of accurate predictions, predicted the crash that was coming, some other things.
[00:10:15.734 --> 00:10:21.636]  Made a few mistakes as well, but a smart guy, outside the box, international TV host, former stockbroker.
[00:10:22.157 --> 00:10:26.078]  I brought up Dent to him and said, look, Dent's been a little more accurate than you in some ways.
[00:10:26.358 --> 00:10:29.739]  What do you say to him when you think gold's going to come back up?
[00:10:30.239 --> 00:10:31.640]  Here's that clip for Mr. Dent.
[00:10:32.503 --> 00:10:37.405]  Look, Harry Dent has been really good in terms of the last five years.
[00:10:37.425 --> 00:10:46.048]  With all the people that he just mentioned, he's probably got the hottest hand in terms of calling deflation, where everyone else has really been saying inflation.
[00:10:46.268 --> 00:10:47.848]  He was very good to say deflation.
[00:10:48.108 --> 00:10:53.170]  All commodities have been deflating, oil is deflating, and he includes gold in that basket.
[00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:58.496]  But my response would be, look at gold outside of just the US dollar.
[00:10:58.536 --> 00:11:03.041]  Because if you look at it through other currencies, it's reacting very, very well.
[00:11:03.281 --> 00:11:04.963]  It's hitting new all-time highs, number one.
[00:11:05.183 --> 00:11:07.786]  So outside of the rigged economy, it's doing well?
[00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:12.131]  Well, on a global basis, it's responding well.
[00:11:12.191 --> 00:11:13.853]  And the second point I would make is that
[00:11:14.947 --> 00:11:27.422]  One aspect that Mr. Dent does not get into that I think is worthy of consideration that would change the dynamic pretty dramatically is if a country like Russia or China decides to
[00:11:28.553 --> 00:11:30.755]  partially back their currency with gold.
[00:11:31.215 --> 00:11:34.178]  So gold is once again monetized.
[00:11:34.698 --> 00:11:36.920]  Then it's really a different paradigm at that point.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:37.300]  Alright.
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:41.303]  And you'll see, I think, gold resume.
[00:11:41.463 --> 00:11:42.524]  It's long-standing.
[00:11:42.544 --> 00:11:43.445]  Okay, let's jump.
[00:11:43.505 --> 00:11:44.566]  I want to go to more calls.
[00:11:44.806 --> 00:11:47.188]  Okay, that's Max Keiser from Russia.
[00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:49.129]  They're in Red Square Tuesday joining us.
[00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:50.871]  Mr. Dent, your response to what he said?
[00:11:51.957 --> 00:11:54.360]  Yeah, I mean, first of all, Max, I've been wrong at times, too.
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.183]  Anybody that makes strong forecasts is going to be wrong.
[00:11:57.543 --> 00:11:59.645]  And we did see this deflationary thing.
[00:11:59.665 --> 00:12:06.153]  That's been our big theme, is the baby boomers slowing down, the largest generation in history, and a deflation
[00:12:06.914 --> 00:12:11.215]  From the bubbles of the past, and especially from the over-expansion of China.
[00:12:11.616 --> 00:12:12.376]  So I agree with you.
[00:12:12.396 --> 00:12:18.258]  I mean, that's what's been most hitting gold, is that China is one of the biggest buyers of gold in the world.
[00:12:18.318 --> 00:12:20.599]  Not, you know, not just industrial consumers.
[00:12:20.679 --> 00:12:27.221]  But he's saying if their stocks go down and their currencies devalue, that they'll run to gold, whether you think it's a commodity or real or not.
[00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:32.107]  Well, I think they're learning the same thing that gold was a bubble.
[00:12:32.307 --> 00:12:38.275]  I mean, I was debating many gold bugs and they always say, oh, well, gold's not a bubble.
[00:12:38.295 --> 00:12:41.139]  I'm like, it went up 670% in 10 years.
[00:12:41.499 --> 00:12:45.645]  That's a bubble in any stock, any real estate, any commodity.
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.923]  Um, so I think gold is just coming back down to reality.
[00:12:49.983 --> 00:12:54.648]  I think long-term gold is going to do well because we're going to have an emerging country-led boom.
[00:12:54.888 --> 00:12:56.349]  Okay, I think you answered that fairly.
[00:12:56.369 --> 00:12:58.131]  I think you're both very smart.
[00:12:58.171 --> 00:13:00.693]  People can make their own decisions, but obviously time will tell.
[00:13:01.494 --> 00:13:01.974]  Well, U.S.
[00:13:02.014 --> 00:13:11.542]  scientists are urging the World Health Organization to take urgent action over the Zika virus, which they say has the potential to be an explosive pandemic.
[00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:18.207]  They are sending out warnings worldwide saying more than 23 countries are now affected by this Zika virus.
[00:13:18.787 --> 00:13:22.509]  Which is linked to shrunken brains in children and it can also cause death.
[00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:33.976]  A lot of countries are urging women to postpone pregnancy until 2018 until more is known about the effects of this virus and there is no cure for it.
[00:13:34.036 --> 00:13:38.879]  Right now they're telling people to just ensure you don't leave any standing water on your property.
[00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:42.021]  Of course, I'm sure they're rushing to find a vaccine for this.
[00:13:42.481 --> 00:13:47.524]  Now today, earlier I spoke with investigative journalist John Rappaport to get his take
[00:13:48.044 --> 00:13:53.108]  On this explosive pandemic, is it really hysterical or is it a scam?
[00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.772]  So John, by now everyone has heard about the Zika virus.
[00:13:57.812 --> 00:13:59.834]  They're putting out all of these alerts.
[00:14:00.495 --> 00:14:01.636]  Use mosquito repellent.
[00:14:01.676 --> 00:14:04.158]  Don't have any standing water on your property.
[00:14:04.898 --> 00:14:09.402]  Telling women to actually postpone pregnancy until 2018 in some countries.
[00:14:09.863 --> 00:14:10.723]  What do you make of this?
[00:14:10.804 --> 00:14:12.045]  Is this true hysteria?
[00:14:12.105 --> 00:14:13.306]  Is this just a giant scam?
[00:14:14.887 --> 00:14:15.648]  Giant scam.
[00:14:15.668 --> 00:14:20.173]  You know, multiple choice question and there's the right answer.
[00:14:20.433 --> 00:14:21.234]  Giant scam.
[00:14:22.115 --> 00:14:26.300]  I've been to this rodeo many times before with viruses and so
[00:14:27.775 --> 00:14:51.775]  And in my recent article, No More Fake News, I run down the useless and deceptive laboratory tests that try to define how, for example, the Zika virus is causing babies to be born with smaller heads and damaged brains, and the science absolutely does not hold up.
[00:14:52.819 --> 00:15:05.183]  But what does hold up as a cause of this happening, and I believe there are multiple causes, and you need to look to Brazil, for example, you are talking about gigantic amounts of pesticide use down there.
[00:15:05.883 --> 00:15:09.225]  They use more pesticides in Brazil than any country in the world.
[00:15:09.805 --> 00:15:11.345]  Any country in the world.
[00:15:12.085 --> 00:15:13.186]  And many of these
[00:15:13.846 --> 00:15:17.529]  Pesticides are banned in 22 other countries.
[00:15:17.589 --> 00:15:26.836]  So you're talking about highly toxic substances in the very area where they're reporting all of these, you know, deformed births.
[00:15:27.937 --> 00:15:30.059]  So that's the first thing that you have to look at.
[00:15:30.099 --> 00:15:31.720]  They're of major importance.
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:38.866]  In fact, in my article, I quote a study that indicates that two pesticides, one of which is atrazine,
[00:15:39.446 --> 00:15:46.315]  It's being used in Brazil now has been linked to babies being born with smaller heads.
[00:15:47.296 --> 00:15:52.002]  But the virus itself, the Zika virus, has never been linked to anything serious.
[00:15:52.382 --> 00:15:54.405]  It's been around since the late 40s.
[00:15:54.485 --> 00:15:56.667]  I mean, that's when it was first discovered.
[00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:03.056]  And since then it's caused mild symptoms, mild illness, etc.
[00:16:03.457 --> 00:16:04.258]  Nothing like this.
[00:16:04.298 --> 00:16:07.201]  And then all of a sudden we get this story blowing up in the press.
[00:16:07.742 --> 00:16:10.645]  Oh, it's causing these horrendous birth defects and so on.
[00:16:11.125 --> 00:16:13.208]  No reason to assume that whatsoever.
[00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:16.231]  The virus becomes the cover story.
[00:16:17.212 --> 00:16:19.914]  For what's actually causing what's happening.
[00:16:20.475 --> 00:16:24.358]  So I list pesticides as a main ingredient there.
[00:16:24.758 --> 00:16:34.666]  And I would also, because other researchers have uncovered this, like Jim Stone, for example, and other people, the TDAP vaccine.
[00:16:35.683 --> 00:16:46.952]  Which was introduced in 2014 in Brazil as recommended for pregnant women, all pregnant women, a very toxic vaccine.
[00:16:47.953 --> 00:16:51.776]  You start to look at these different causes and vectors coming together.
[00:16:52.356 --> 00:17:00.602]  Incredible malnutrition, poverty, lack of basic sanitation, toxic pesticides, this vaccine, and so on.
[00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:03.545]  Now you begin to see what's actually causing
[00:17:04.285 --> 00:17:11.472]  These horrendous malformations, which we've seen in other places around the world, not just in Brazil, for the same reasons.
[00:17:13.154 --> 00:17:17.778]  The virus is always a fantastic cover story because people
[00:17:18.727 --> 00:17:19.788]  Automatically saluted.
[00:17:19.868 --> 00:17:23.750]  Well, oh my god, it's dangerous and it's carried by a mosquito and we can't see it.
[00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:24.870]  We know nothing about it.
[00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.251]  We have to rely on medical authorities.
[00:17:27.612 --> 00:17:31.373]  If they ever come up with a vaccine, we'll have to get it, etc, etc, etc.
[00:17:32.014 --> 00:17:38.417]  All just unthinking, mindless compliance with false science.
[00:17:39.037 --> 00:17:42.199]  So that's my opening shot on what's happening with Zika.
[00:17:43.473 --> 00:17:44.233]  Well, thank you, John.
[00:17:44.293 --> 00:17:48.715]  Well, we will definitely keep our eyes on any further reporting that you do investigating with this.
[00:17:49.035 --> 00:17:50.255]  And, you know, I agree.
[00:17:50.275 --> 00:17:51.756]  It sort of popped up out of nowhere.
[00:17:51.776 --> 00:18:02.960]  It'll be interesting to see if we're going to witness more cases of microcephaly in other countries that maybe aren't using this particular pesticide or this TDAP vaccine.
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:04.380]  Thank you so much, John Rappaport.
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.260]  NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.961]  Thank you, Brianne.
[00:18:32.717 --> 00:18:37.640]  Shane Steiner's involvement with InfoWarsLife.com truly happened in an organic way.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.502]  I went to high school with Shane, his brother, knew his parents well.
[00:18:40.702 --> 00:18:46.385]  And he was visiting the office once, hadn't been to the office in years, and said, wow, I notice you're making and selling supplements.
[00:18:46.405 --> 00:18:47.146]  Do these really work?
[00:18:47.186 --> 00:18:52.249]  Because I've tried a lot of supplements as a workout enthusiast, and I really think most of them are hype.
[00:18:52.369 --> 00:18:53.770]  And I said, here, take some home, try it.
[00:18:53.870 --> 00:19:00.453]  Well, a few weeks later, he came in blown away and said, I want to buy three boxes of this stuff to give my friends and family.
[00:19:00.854 --> 00:19:02.354]  It's simply amazing.
[00:19:02.394 --> 00:19:03.675]  He said, why does it work so well?
[00:19:03.715 --> 00:19:08.258]  And I said, listen, go to InfoWarsLife.com, watch the informational videos with Dr. Group and others.
[00:19:08.458 --> 00:19:09.959]  They understand how it all works.
[00:19:10.239 --> 00:19:11.820]  I know that it works for me.
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.080]  That's all I understand.
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:18.383]  The science, the facts, the research, people's testimonials, they're all on InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:19:18.403 --> 00:19:19.384]  You can check it out for yourself.
[00:19:19.964 --> 00:19:21.085]  I wanted to go to the gym.
[00:19:21.325 --> 00:19:31.172]  I wanted to push myself and work out harder, and that led to me being able to come out and do stuff like the barefooting and the surfing and stuff like that, which I would have never done.
[00:19:31.192 --> 00:19:33.734]  I never would have done that two years ago.
[00:19:34.314 --> 00:19:37.957]  Shane has said over and over again, more than just libido and energy,
[00:19:38.497 --> 00:19:40.259]  It made him want to get into the gym more.
[00:19:40.599 --> 00:19:42.060]  It made him want to get in better shape.
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.722]  And believe me, the Steiners have amazing genetics.
[00:19:45.283 --> 00:19:47.725]  His brother is a world champion steer wrestler.
[00:19:48.045 --> 00:19:52.048]  His dad, Bobby Steiner, is a famous world champion bull rider.
[00:19:52.228 --> 00:19:53.910]  They've got natural genetics.
[00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:59.054]  But when you added this to the mix, in Shane's own words, it took him to the next level.
[00:20:11.354 --> 00:20:13.075]  Shane noticed the mental clarity.
[00:20:13.516 --> 00:20:16.998]  Bobby was able to work out longer and gain muscle mass.
[00:20:17.118 --> 00:20:18.419]  He's already completely shredded.
[00:20:18.639 --> 00:20:21.281]  I gotta admit, for me, the biggest effect has been libido.
[00:20:21.641 --> 00:20:27.685]  Now, I've never claimed to have a body like some beach model, but back when I was 20, 22 years old and worked out every day, I looked great.
[00:20:27.745 --> 00:20:33.750]  But over the years, being married, having three kids, working 18 hours a day, I gained basically 100 pounds.
[00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:37.032]  And it's been a long process of losing that weight in the last four years.
[00:20:37.192 --> 00:20:39.794]  But if you look at the photos and the videos,
[00:20:40.034 --> 00:20:40.274]  I think?
[00:20:59.219 --> 00:21:09.283]  This has actually made me feel so good that here lately, about a year ago, I started training jiu-jitsu and that kind of led to doing some boxing and kickboxing.
[00:21:09.303 --> 00:21:21.789]  I mean, it's amazing that two years ago I was on the couch and couldn't even tie my shoes and now I'm training with MMA fighters and just doing stuff that I never thought that I would be doing ever again.
[00:21:22.069 --> 00:21:23.910]  So, Supermail Vitality has
[00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:31.037]  Allowed me to do some amazing things and if it has those kind of effects for me, I know that it will do great things for you.
[00:21:31.577 --> 00:21:33.219]  So just try Supermail Vitality.
[00:21:33.439 --> 00:21:35.561]  I promise you, you'll love it.
[00:21:36.042 --> 00:21:38.324]  And finally, let's look at Anthony Gucciardi.
[00:21:38.725 --> 00:21:40.707]  Infowars.com reporter.
[00:21:40.987 --> 00:21:41.728]  He also works
[00:21:42.088 --> 00:21:46.930]  With Dr. Group and others helping develop the newest, most cutting-edge, high-quality supplements.
[00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:51.951]  Let's take a look at what happened when he tried to barefoot ski for the first time with the Steiners.
[00:21:52.312 --> 00:21:53.692]  And remember, we're not making fun of him.
[00:21:53.972 --> 00:21:55.433]  He had the will to get in the arena.
[00:21:55.733 --> 00:22:01.155]  And he's lost more than 10 pounds in the last few years of fat and gained more than 10 pounds of muscle.
[00:22:01.495 --> 00:22:04.876]  And Anthony chalks it up to super male vitality as well.
[00:22:19.448 --> 00:22:28.755]  Bottom line folks, you want to discover the power of super male vitality and super female vitality for yourself by visiting InfoWarsLife.com today or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:22:36.578 --> 00:22:42.884]  Here to examine the Oregon standoff from a different angle, renowned investigative journalist and author John Rapoport.
[00:22:43.204 --> 00:22:45.746]  He's the editor of NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[00:22:46.447 --> 00:22:48.388]  So John, thank you so much for being with us today.
[00:22:48.769 --> 00:22:55.295]  Now we know that there are so many issues swirling around what's going on there at the Malheur Wildlife Refuge with this standoff.
[00:22:55.435 --> 00:22:59.478]  Obviously we've got the Bundys, the Hammonds, there's the federal land grab.
[00:23:00.639 --> 00:23:08.502]  In this particular instance, we have cattle ranchers who have been fed up with the abuse that they feel they're suffering with the federal government.
[00:23:09.102 --> 00:23:18.985]  But I wanted to get you on the show to offer a different angle into not only what could be going on here and what's really behind this particular federal land grab, but others across the country as well.
[00:23:20.888 --> 00:23:30.575]  Yeah, this is the uranium story, Leanne, and it sounds improbable on the surface until you start poking down into it and you see what's really going on.
[00:23:31.556 --> 00:23:45.807]  Because it's understood and acknowledged, it has been for some time, even in the mainstream press, that the Russians, by whom I mean Putin, have gained control over 20% of U.S.
[00:23:45.847 --> 00:23:46.527]  uranium production.
[00:23:51.164 --> 00:24:01.166]  The New York Times ran a pretty big story on this a while ago, and it surfaced and then it sank as usual without any real further investigation.
[00:24:01.967 --> 00:24:13.729]  But to dig into this, what we're talking about here is a company called Uranium One, which was a Canadian company.
[00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:20.411]  And during the time when this sale was being negotiated to Putin and Russia,
[00:24:21.727 --> 00:24:26.388]  This company, Uranium One, had outposts in the U.S.
[00:24:26.548 --> 00:24:36.571]  in uranium mines, so they were essentially bargaining to sell their company to the Russians so the Russians could, in part, control U.S.
[00:24:36.691 --> 00:24:38.192]  uranium production.
[00:24:39.992 --> 00:24:43.033]  And in order for that deal to be signed off on,
[00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:54.381]  One of the federal agencies of the United States that had to okay it, because this is national security, is the State Department, then headed up by Hillary Clinton.
[00:24:56.434 --> 00:24:57.094]  Step two.
[00:24:57.835 --> 00:25:16.701]  Step two is, during this negotiation, this period of time, some millions of dollars were coming into the Clinton Foundation from Canadian mining big shots, who obviously wanted this deal to go through and sell their company to Putin.
[00:25:18.722 --> 00:25:20.242]  Wait a minute, let's back off.
[00:25:20.402 --> 00:25:21.723]  Holy mackerel here.
[00:25:22.563 --> 00:25:25.584]  So, the New York Times covered all of these angles.
[00:25:26.693 --> 00:25:40.239]  You know, they wouldn't step up to the plate and actually connect all the dots and say, you know, we're looking here at mass, deep criminality on the part of the Clintons.
[00:25:41.059 --> 00:25:47.963]  And, you know, much more deep investigation to get courtroom evidence needs to take place.
[00:25:48.023 --> 00:25:49.163]  They just kind of dropped it.
[00:25:49.743 --> 00:25:55.206]  But as it turns out, in an article in Telehub by Shepard and Bellis,
[00:25:56.917 --> 00:26:20.947]  He links to a page, a federal page, Bureau of Land Management, that indicates that in 2011, this same company, Uranium One, met with local officials and people in Southern Oregon in the same general, or maybe even exactly specific, it's hard to tell, but definitely in the same general area as the Oregon standoff took place.
[00:26:22.227 --> 00:26:23.488]  And they were discussing
[00:26:24.847 --> 00:26:33.917]  Mining, opening a yellow cake uranium mining operation in that very area where the standoff has been taking place.
[00:26:35.118 --> 00:26:39.382]  So all of a sudden, this is a whole different dimension on the story.
[00:26:40.603 --> 00:26:41.384]  And you've got
[00:26:42.617 --> 00:26:52.565]  A much more sinister reason for the Feds to be extremely concerned about what was going on and is going on in this area.
[00:26:53.326 --> 00:27:09.939]  Because it would not only be about all the factors you mentioned at the top here, but about uranium mining in the US, controlled by Russia, with the Clintons involved.
[00:27:11.465 --> 00:27:38.838]  Wow that is bombshell and so obviously one of these a lot of the things that we're hearing people saying is well that's our land and how dare they you know that land belongs to the American people but here we have the BLM taking grazing rights and having to pay off the BLM but actually now this company working with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife they made a presentation to the BLM outlining plans for the development of this mine
[00:27:39.318 --> 00:27:51.206]  And so it says here, the Vail District has agreed to work with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife on mitigation for the New You uranium claims, which are located in core sage-grouse habitat, on and on.
[00:27:51.506 --> 00:27:58.651]  So what are they doing, negotiating on behalf of the American people to develop a uranium mine with the Russians?
[00:27:59.231 --> 00:28:00.672]  That belongs to Russia, right?
[00:28:00.932 --> 00:28:08.217]  So the ultimate irony of this whole thing is that you've got these sovereign cattle ranchers and their supporters.
[00:28:09.728 --> 00:28:29.918]  sitting there in this area saying the feds have no right to be grabbing this land in the first place and you know it's taking land away from the American people that belongs to the American people and they could very well be talking about Russian land you know Russian land under this uranium contract so
[00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:49.649]  Who knows what the projection is going to be now that there's been this tremendous uproar in this area of southern Oregon, which is another reason why the Feds would be so exercised about this, because the last thing they want is national attention drawn to this area for any reason.
[00:28:50.410 --> 00:29:06.563]  Because if this uranium mining operation goes forward, and everybody learns, of course, that the production is going to be, you know, the uranium is under the control of the Russians, now you've got things blowing up everywhere.
[00:29:07.188 --> 00:29:15.194]  Absolutely, and this was another issue when the Bundys were having to deal with that there in Nevada with Harry Reid.
[00:29:15.354 --> 00:29:26.883]  Then we learned that there was actually a solar farm that was owned by the Chinese that was being erected on all of these lands that were supposedly being cleared out to protect the desert tortoise.
[00:29:27.383 --> 00:29:34.148]  And so it's actually these solar farms controlled by the Chinese who are giving energy to the people there in Nevada and other states.
[00:29:35.229 --> 00:29:40.592]  I don't think we the people are going to be getting a cut out of that and making our energy bills any lower.
[00:29:41.072 --> 00:29:42.513]  So how do they justify this?
[00:29:42.854 --> 00:29:53.720]  And of course this gives a little bit of background when Hillary Clinton was asked about her relationship with Putin and she just kind of laughed it off saying it was an interesting, interesting relationship.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.122]  Yeah, I would say more than interesting as it turns out.
[00:29:58.208 --> 00:30:04.029]  Well, you know, this is a naked situation here, potentially, for the Feds.
[00:30:04.649 --> 00:30:06.349]  Because there is no explanation.
[00:30:06.409 --> 00:30:11.590]  I mean, how do you justify, okay, we're going to sell 20% of U.S.
[00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:13.991]  uranium production to Russia.
[00:30:14.351 --> 00:30:15.951]  That makes sense to everybody, right?
[00:30:16.311 --> 00:30:16.971]  No problem.
[00:30:17.331 --> 00:30:22.372]  I mean, as soon as the words are out of your mouth, people are just staggered.
[00:30:23.212 --> 00:30:24.313]  What are you talking about?
[00:30:25.613 --> 00:30:26.293]  Why not just
[00:30:28.209 --> 00:30:32.576]  Did him 20% of all nuclear power plants in the U.S.
[00:30:32.696 --> 00:30:35.861]  or 20% of all nuclear weapons.
[00:30:35.881 --> 00:30:39.466]  I mean, it's that kind of staggering story.
[00:30:40.408 --> 00:30:43.572]  And it was out there and then it just disappeared.
[00:30:44.941 --> 00:30:48.904]  In part, probably because Hillary Clinton is running for president.
[00:30:49.644 --> 00:30:49.904]  Absolutely.
[00:30:49.964 --> 00:30:54.287]  And the last thing that she wants is more publicity about this.
[00:30:54.327 --> 00:31:06.375]  Hey, your State Department, Hillary, was one of the nine federal agencies that had to okay this deal to sell this uranium company to Russia.
[00:31:08.036 --> 00:31:09.779]  And money was pouring in.
[00:31:09.859 --> 00:31:21.355]  And by the way, the money that poured into the Clinton Foundation from Canadian mining executives during this period that I mentioned, this fact was covered up by the Clinton Foundation.
[00:31:22.344 --> 00:31:27.207]  You didn't see on their books that these donations were coming in.
[00:31:27.868 --> 00:31:37.394]  And she had supposedly made a deal with Obama saying, look, you know, we'll mind our P's and Q's on the Clinton Foundation while I'm Secretary of State.
[00:31:37.715 --> 00:31:40.877]  You won't have anything to worry about vis-a-vis conflict of interest.
[00:31:41.177 --> 00:31:45.940]  And of course, this was all before the whole Clinton Foundation story blew up in the press.
[00:31:46.661 --> 00:31:50.563]  But now we've got something much deeper that has to do with the Clinton Foundation.
[00:31:50.984 --> 00:31:51.664]  They hid those
[00:31:51.664 --> 00:31:54.445]  Those donations from the Canadian mining people.
[00:31:55.146 --> 00:31:58.127]  I mean, what more do you want here?
[00:31:58.587 --> 00:31:59.128]  There it is.
[00:31:59.668 --> 00:31:59.888]  Right.
[00:32:00.048 --> 00:32:06.031]  I mean, the scandal, it just is never-ending scandal, and the plot thickens there with the Clintons, the Clinton Foundation.
[00:32:06.471 --> 00:32:08.052]  John Rapoport, no more fake news.
[00:32:08.532 --> 00:32:13.275]  Thank you so much, and obviously we will stay tuned with more of your bombshell reporting.
[00:32:13.355 --> 00:32:13.755]  Thank you.
[00:32:14.355 --> 00:32:14.956]  Thank you, Leigh Ann.
[00:32:14.976 --> 00:32:15.536]  I appreciate it.
[00:32:43.507 --> 00:32:52.790]  You guys have the exclusive for which is a product called Deep Cleanse and why I'm so excited about it is it's a unique formula almost like the iodine crystals.
[00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:56.652]  We have two unique products that nobody in the world has.
[00:32:57.032 --> 00:33:08.796]  One of the most amazing ingredients in the world and it's called Shilajit and it's actually known as blood of the mountain or rock sweat because thousands of years ago as a matter of fact this ingredient
[00:33:09.016 --> 00:33:11.838]  Was only given to the elite of the elite.
[00:33:12.039 --> 00:33:15.442]  Thousands of years ago, up in the Himalayan mountains and in Tibet.
[00:33:15.462 --> 00:33:19.285]  And we wanted to put this in stuff for a couple years, but we couldn't get an organic form.
[00:33:19.465 --> 00:33:19.685]  Right.
[00:33:19.765 --> 00:33:20.806]  I mean, let's explain.
[00:33:20.866 --> 00:33:24.009]  I mean, this stuff's so good, we couldn't put it out for years.
[00:33:24.289 --> 00:33:32.731]  Right, so I had to actually, it's kind of like the iodine crystals, finding a source deep in the earth that we could get the cleanest source available.
[00:33:33.171 --> 00:33:42.713]  But in Tibet and in Nepal and in the Himalayan mountains, thousands of years ago they found, they watched these monkeys and during the summer months the monkeys would go up into the mountains.
[00:33:42.733 --> 00:33:43.994]  Now you're being racist against monkeys.
[00:33:44.034 --> 00:33:44.674]  And they would pick
[00:33:45.174 --> 00:33:47.575]  This black substance from the mountains.
[00:33:48.056 --> 00:33:54.559]  And so in Russia, they actually, it grows in Russia and the mountains and in the Himalayas and only in the summer.
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:34:02.864]  And shilajit is actually the decomposition of up to 7,000 different medicinal herbs.
[00:34:02.924 --> 00:34:09.588]  So it decomposes, all these different herbs decompose in the Himalayan mountains and the volcanic soil up there.
[00:34:09.848 --> 00:34:13.851]  And what happens in the summertime- So it's almost like an oil from
[00:34:14.731 --> 00:34:17.454]  Yes, it's high in fulvic acid, it's high in humic acid.
[00:34:17.474 --> 00:34:21.800]  Because they're always claiming oil is really from decomposed animals and plants.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.785]  There is some oil that is based from fossils, but most of it's really abiotic.
[00:34:27.206 --> 00:34:31.191]  So this is a true fossil source?
[00:34:31.271 --> 00:34:31.971]  I mean, explain it to me.
[00:34:32.652 --> 00:34:47.705]  It's really the decomposition, like I said, of over 7,000 different medicinal herbs and plants and with the rocks and the pressure deep in the mountains it freezes and during the summertime and the pressures build it up, it oozes out.
[00:34:47.825 --> 00:34:49.387]  So it literally oozes out of the mountain.
[00:34:49.407 --> 00:34:50.228]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:50.588 --> 00:34:51.589]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:51.629 --> 00:34:54.752]  It's black and it's highly nutritious.
[00:34:55.592 --> 00:34:58.195]  Even in the 1980s when the Olympic
[00:34:58.895 --> 00:35:01.237]  Athletes in Russia were accused of being on steroids.
[00:35:01.277 --> 00:35:08.622]  They found out that they were actually been given Shilajit because it works as an anabolic as well and it builds muscles.
[00:35:08.822 --> 00:35:09.863]  It's a big dose in there.
[00:35:09.903 --> 00:35:14.006]  The second big main ingredient in there is a volcanic zeolite concentrate.
[00:35:14.046 --> 00:35:19.610]  And what this formula is designed to do, the Shilajit and the zeolites have a real strong negative charge.
[00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:25.014]  All the metals and chemicals and PCBs and VOCs have positive charges.
[00:35:25.794 --> 00:35:33.897]  So these go in, they grab it, and then they safely eliminate it through the body so you can become healthy.
[00:35:33.937 --> 00:35:37.878]  I mean, this is an amazing formula.
[00:35:38.018 --> 00:35:43.880]  I wish I actually had it, but because this was an exclusive InfoWars Life product, you're the only one in the world that has.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:52.407]  This formula now and, you know, there is going to be a limited supply available when you sell out because you can only harvest this once a year.
[00:35:52.587 --> 00:35:53.628]  How do people take it?
[00:35:53.688 --> 00:35:56.010]  How is it recommended that this be done?
[00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:57.812]  Just a daily dose?
[00:35:58.092 --> 00:35:59.814]  Yeah, daily dose.
[00:35:59.894 --> 00:36:01.275]  The instructions are on the label.
[00:36:01.315 --> 00:36:04.698]  You know, of course, I kind of modify it for each individual.
[00:36:04.718 --> 00:36:06.299]  It depends on what your lifestyle is.
[00:36:06.439 --> 00:36:11.464]  I mean, honestly, the best thing to do is for you to avoid all these chemicals and toxins in your environment.
[00:36:11.804 --> 00:36:14.745]  And try to identify them and start slowly reducing them.
[00:36:15.205 --> 00:36:22.948]  But personally, I'm going to probably take it every day, every other day, and I'll probably go with about a dropper full to maybe two dropper fulls.
[00:36:24.028 --> 00:36:26.289]  And I don't expose myself to any chemicals.

[00:36:41.996 --> 00:36:42.696]  This is a war.
[00:36:47.339 --> 00:36:49.820]  Former Congressman, thank you so much for taking time out to join us.
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:54.380]  You're welcome.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:55.941]  It's good to be with you today, Alex.
[00:36:56.261 --> 00:36:59.703]  We've got about a three-second delay today, so I'm going to pretty much try to give you the floor, sir.
[00:36:59.743 --> 00:37:00.784]  Let's get into this.
[00:37:00.844 --> 00:37:02.325]  I mean, this is everything we've warned of.
[00:37:02.705 --> 00:37:04.125]  Obviously, we're not saying it's imminent.
[00:37:04.346 --> 00:37:08.708]  Tanks in the streets, but it's just part of this soft, creeping frog in the pot, sir.
[00:37:13.066 --> 00:37:18.647]  Yeah, this once again is giving more authority to the president and taking it away from the Congress.
[00:37:18.687 --> 00:37:20.568]  This is sort of a traditional trend.
[00:37:21.168 --> 00:37:27.209]  It means that the Congress is absent, AWOL, because they don't want the responsibility.
[00:37:27.269 --> 00:37:33.751]  This issue came up as we were talking about the authority to go into Iraq and other places.
[00:37:34.151 --> 00:37:38.252]  And it was always, even when we had a Republican president, Republican
[00:37:38.932 --> 00:37:40.954]  The Congress didn't want to go along with it.
[00:37:41.074 --> 00:37:42.655]  The Democrats didn't want to go along with it.
[00:37:42.916 --> 00:37:46.519]  They don't want to assume any responsibility, so they'd rather give up their prerogative.
[00:37:46.799 --> 00:37:57.048]  It's one of the main, major mysteries of our country, why the Founders worked so hard to allow these powers to be put into the hands of the body that's supposed to be closest to the people.
[00:37:57.728 --> 00:38:03.173]  And it hasn't been literally usurped and taken so much as the Congress gives it up.
[00:38:03.593 --> 00:38:11.340]  But then the Congress, you know, after a while, it becomes a whole, almost a policy statement.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:16.885]  Because presidents, you know, whether they have the authority or not, they do a lot anyway.
[00:38:16.945 --> 00:38:19.467]  You know, we live in the age of executive orders.
[00:38:19.907 --> 00:38:23.268]  So this is very, very important because it's out in the open what they're doing.
[00:38:23.288 --> 00:38:27.130]  Like you say, Alex, they're not reporting it and letting the American people know.
[00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.711]  But you know, they'll do pretty much what they want.
[00:38:30.731 --> 00:38:37.373]  Remember when we were opposing the Congress voting on an authorizing bombing of Syria and the people didn't want it?
[00:38:37.453 --> 00:38:40.254]  And Obama backed off.
[00:38:40.374 --> 00:38:41.975]  Yet he went ahead and did the bombing anyway.
[00:38:42.455 --> 00:38:44.156]  So, it's out of control.
[00:38:44.176 --> 00:38:51.821]  It's this endorsement and this fanaticism of endorsing this concept that actually was born with Woodrow Wilson.
[00:38:51.841 --> 00:38:55.083]  We're responsible for making the world safe for democracy.
[00:38:55.143 --> 00:39:07.411]  Now that we are the sole superpower and we have the sole control of the reserve currency of the world, and people do depend on us, at least for now, that we can get away with this.
[00:39:07.791 --> 00:39:08.932]  But it's very, very dangerous.
[00:39:09.092 --> 00:39:11.434]  That senator was very great on that statement.
[00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:17.280]  I wish he took that same non-interventionist policy with economic issues, but that's another story.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:27.049]  But he was exactly right on that, and Connecticut must be pretty good because the former senator there voted against the war going into Iraq.
[00:39:27.089 --> 00:39:29.311]  I think he was the only senator that voted against it.
[00:39:29.771 --> 00:39:30.953]  Shafi.
[00:39:30.973 --> 00:39:35.439]  So this is another blatant attack.
[00:39:35.519 --> 00:39:37.481]  And you mentioned it, Alex.
[00:39:37.581 --> 00:39:40.385]  This comes from the leader of the Republican Party.
[00:39:40.625 --> 00:39:44.731]  And he's supposed to be opposing giving power to a Democratic president.
[00:39:45.051 --> 00:39:46.412]  But you know what they're thinking about?
[00:39:46.432 --> 00:39:49.675]  They're thinking about how soon there's going to be a Republican president.
[00:39:49.955 --> 00:39:56.421]  And besides, I don't think whether you have the Republican president, at least tradition has it, or a Democratic president, they're all the same people.
[00:39:56.881 --> 00:40:04.168]  So whether they give it to Obama for a year, most people assume whether it's Hillary or a Republican,
[00:40:04.468 --> 00:40:09.594]  They're all, both sides will be authoritarian, and they're going to make use of this.
[00:40:09.954 --> 00:40:11.677]  But it's very, very dangerous.
[00:40:11.817 --> 00:40:15.541]  It's an attack on liberty that should alert the American people.
[00:40:15.942 --> 00:40:22.429]  But unfortunately, we in the liberty movement have a lot of work to do to wake up the American people.
[00:40:25.566 --> 00:40:29.469]  This, for those that have read history like yourself, is just very obvious.
[00:40:29.789 --> 00:40:42.238]  It's confirmation of the march into totalitarianism, just like we saw the spending authorization that they put through that gave the president a blank check.
[00:40:42.898 --> 00:40:52.085]  They're doing all of these unprecedented things now, when there was months of debating, as you know, the big Iraq war resolution that you said was way too broad and opposed.
[00:40:52.905 --> 00:41:01.212]  And now they're just doing things that would, you know, turn heads if Putin did something like this, or if the Chinese did something like this.
[00:41:02.012 --> 00:41:04.895]  I mean, why do you think they're suddenly doing this?
[00:41:05.495 --> 00:41:10.900]  And why would Mitch McConnell want to put into something like this in place?
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:13.822]  And then why would the media not make a big deal out of it?
[00:41:17.625 --> 00:41:21.408]  Yes, and it wasn't up front, you know.
[00:41:21.488 --> 00:41:26.932]  It was done on a Friday in the middle of a snowstorm, hoping that it wouldn't be covered, and it wasn't covered.
[00:41:27.353 --> 00:41:30.115]  And yet he felt compelled to do this.
[00:41:30.635 --> 00:41:33.557]  So, yes, I think potentially there's always this...
[00:41:34.418 --> 00:41:51.602]  Waking up the next morning and a major conflict going on, but it's very suspicious that they're covering their bases because I think, you know, there is talk about expanding the war, you know, in Syria and even in Libya again, and everything is breaking down.
[00:41:51.702 --> 00:41:54.783]  Nothing worked in Iraq and nothing worked in Afghanistan.
[00:41:55.423 --> 00:42:01.629]  And there's a lot of people now, you know, the Republicans aren't very good about a constitutional foreign policy.
[00:42:01.669 --> 00:42:03.051]  They want to grant this authority.
[00:42:03.691 --> 00:42:06.534]  And there's a lot of them that want boots on the ground.
[00:42:06.594 --> 00:42:15.082]  And this authority that we're talking about literally gives the president of power boots on the ground in any country or even in our own country.
[00:42:15.442 --> 00:42:21.550]  Under martial law, it doesn't limit it to time or space or anything at all.
[00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:23.031]  It's just an open-ended.
[00:42:23.552 --> 00:42:32.223]  And this is the reason why it does raise the question is do we have we just gone along with at least the presentation
[00:42:32.703 --> 00:42:41.729]  Of what would be a military dictatorship, and they may well have either plans or fears that we're not all privy to.
[00:42:41.769 --> 00:42:49.233]  Of course, those of us who have been concerned are always looking for the expansion of presidential powers, and that's really the culprit.
[00:42:49.273 --> 00:42:52.775]  You mentioned the economic factors and how they get together and spend that money.
[00:42:53.436 --> 00:42:58.359]  And, you know, just remember the pictures of Boehner and Pelosi's
[00:42:59.259 --> 00:43:15.940]  Arm in arm and passing this budget and then our new speaker went along and passed that budget which was atrocious budget and yet it was leadership on both sides and everybody wants reform except in the areas that they don't want reform.
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:24.452]  Because, other than for Rand, I think he's the only one who's taken the position that we don't have to spend another trillion dollars on militarism.
[00:43:24.773 --> 00:43:26.335]  What we need is a common sense.
[00:43:26.395 --> 00:43:31.342]  Absolutely, you know, I've said- Get out of these hot spots and don't go aggravating people.
[00:43:31.883 --> 00:43:32.223]  Yes, sir.
[00:43:32.243 --> 00:43:33.845]  Dr. Paul, I've supported your son.
[00:43:33.905 --> 00:43:38.250]  I was your president for the last two years, and he was still number one six, seven months ago.
[00:43:39.131 --> 00:43:42.934]  And then now the media and all the manipulation has helped try to push him out of there.
[00:43:43.395 --> 00:43:53.325]  But separately, the thing I'm most proud of what he did, and I wish that he may be doing, I don't see in the media, is come back and say, you know, double down on what Trump said.
[00:43:53.345 --> 00:43:53.705]  Say, look,
[00:43:54.625 --> 00:43:56.806]  Forget just not letting all Muslims in the country.
[00:43:56.986 --> 00:43:58.887]  We are going to end what's happening in Syria.
[00:43:59.267 --> 00:44:00.147]  Our government started it.
[00:44:00.247 --> 00:44:11.552]  Obama started it with the neocons and the rhinos and name the names of Graham and the other senators like McCain and say you helped fund Al Qaeda.
[00:44:11.853 --> 00:44:12.913]  You helped fund ISIS.
[00:44:13.193 --> 00:44:14.894]  That's what your son was saying.
[00:44:15.094 --> 00:44:15.294]  We're good.
[00:44:32.449 --> 00:44:35.411]  And then, now, we haven't heard as much about that.
[00:44:35.472 --> 00:44:43.338]  I think that's something that could bring your son right back to the front of the race if he comes out and says, look, I'm not the guy saying, you know, stop what's happening in Syria now.
[00:44:43.518 --> 00:44:47.221]  I'm the one that said three years ago, stop it, because that is so important.
[00:44:47.241 --> 00:44:48.962]  What do you say to that with election 2016 here, sir?
[00:44:54.670 --> 00:45:05.357]  Well, the whole thing is, is the American taxpayer and the American people suffer from the consequences of believing that it's necessary for our national security, which is a complete lie.
[00:45:05.397 --> 00:45:09.720]  You know, lies took us into the Iraq War, and the lies continue.
[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:13.763]  Right now it's created this migration of millions of people.
[00:45:14.203 --> 00:45:16.725]  Europe is much more vulnerable than we are.
[00:45:16.765 --> 00:45:17.986]  We have our problems here.
[00:45:18.286 --> 00:45:21.948]  But the American taxpayer pays for this, and we pay for it by debt.
[00:45:22.569 --> 00:45:24.390]  And, you know, they claim we have a
[00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:30.093]  Decent economy, and we don't have to worry that much, and jobs are coming back, and all that nonsense.
[00:45:30.453 --> 00:45:43.161]  But we're paying for the militarism, and there's a huge debt, and Europe is breaking out with a major crisis, and you're going to see throngs of immigrants causing problems.
[00:45:43.641 --> 00:45:46.463]  And then, the taxpayer, in our country especially,
[00:45:47.343 --> 00:45:48.884]  We'll be taxed for this.
[00:45:48.944 --> 00:45:51.465]  One of my approaches was quit subsidizing something.
[00:45:51.485 --> 00:45:52.685]  You won't have so much of it.
[00:45:53.266 --> 00:45:56.187]  And immigration is totally subsidized and rewarded.
[00:45:56.207 --> 00:45:56.727]  They come in.
[00:45:57.087 --> 00:46:00.729]  So I would say that you've got to cut off the subsidies.
[00:46:00.929 --> 00:46:12.034]  But right now, even if you cut off the freebies, like all free medical care and education, that we'll have to spend money for maintaining
[00:46:12.954 --> 00:46:16.156]  You know, law and order, where people aren't burning our cities down.
[00:46:16.976 --> 00:46:23.040]  But that is, this is a predictable event because of the foreign policy.
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:29.403]  I really think that you cannot look at our economic problems without looking at the foreign policy.
[00:46:29.463 --> 00:46:34.546]  Because the foreign policy, so many of them are saying, you know what, we need more of the past.
[00:46:34.606 --> 00:46:39.029]  It's sort of like the Fed saying, well we have problems so we have to print more money and use more debt.
[00:46:54.249 --> 00:47:00.315]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, you can get six months free at PrisonPlanet.TV, but only for one more week.
[00:47:00.476 --> 00:47:03.739]  Next Monday, the special that only comes around once the year ends.
[00:47:03.819 --> 00:47:14.791]  In fact, we've never offered six months free before, but I really want to get more people to join and be able to watch the nightly news, to see the live reports we do, the special reports, all my films, e-books, and so much more.
[00:47:15.391 --> 00:47:27.275]  One person can share their membership with 20 people, and you are funding the absolute, very leading edge, the vanguard of the resistance to the globalist operation on every front.
[00:47:27.395 --> 00:47:32.076]  We have to have our own platform that is harder for them to censor, harder for the system to shut down.
[00:47:32.196 --> 00:47:33.857]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:47:33.957 --> 00:47:40.759]  We put out the daily radio show free with the video and audio feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show, but it is the members
[00:47:41.039 --> 00:48:03.412]  That get the nightly news exclusively and first and the commercial free video podcasts and audio podcasts that are paying it forward and financing and helping so many other people see the truth when we put the videos on Facebook, YouTube, and it's PrisonPlanet.TV that finances so much of the cameras, the equipment, the crew.
[00:48:03.812 --> 00:48:04.493]  The Reporters.
[00:48:04.813 --> 00:48:07.856]  You are becoming a PrisonPlanet.TV member.
[00:48:08.136 --> 00:48:11.039]  You get exclusive HD, higher quality, get it first.
[00:48:11.179 --> 00:48:16.243]  And then you can download it, share it with friends and family, share your passcode with them, your username.
[00:48:16.464 --> 00:48:20.648]  It's a win-win, and then you're helping finance to put it out for free to everybody.
[00:48:20.868 --> 00:48:21.869]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:48:24.278 --> 00:48:25.659]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:48:25.939 --> 00:48:27.220]  You can't survive without it.
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:28.321]  But where do you get it?

[00:48:54.138 --> 00:48:54.223]  Yeah.
[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.881]  I'm not gonna sit here and take it anymore!
[00:49:29.395 --> 00:49:30.656]  Wow, what an intro!
[00:49:30.776 --> 00:49:35.658]  And here we are live at 7.49 and 18 seconds, Central Standard Time.
[00:49:35.918 --> 00:49:38.880]  We're simulcasting the intro of this also on Facebook Mentions.
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:48.264]  We've got, of course, the one, the only, Jakari Jackson, and the one, the only, the wonder woman of politics and the info war, Leanne McAdoo, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:48.604 --> 00:49:53.446]  And of course, you know who I am, Alex Jones, and we are here to fight the globalists.
[00:49:53.486 --> 00:49:56.648]  We have come to chew bubblegum and kick globalists' butt.
[00:49:57.108 --> 00:50:01.800]  And to quote the late, great listener and viewer, Rowdy Piper, we're all out of bubble gum.
[00:50:02.876 --> 00:50:05.977]  Now, the crew's asking me, I'm asking myself, what are we doing tonight?
[00:50:06.017 --> 00:50:07.097]  Because things are fast-paced.
[00:50:07.137 --> 00:50:08.218]  I got a call at 7 a.m.
[00:50:08.238 --> 00:50:13.659]  this morning from Richard Reeves, our political correspondent, following Trump and the other candidates around the country.
[00:50:13.959 --> 00:50:22.642]  He's in Iowa for the big debate tonight, and we can punch it up on screen behind us for TV viewers of InfoWars Nightly News and extended debate coverage.
[00:50:23.202 --> 00:50:25.423]  We have an amazing shot.
[00:50:25.463 --> 00:50:26.443]  That's our feed.
[00:50:27.143 --> 00:50:31.885]  Not CNN, not the other two networks that are there covering the Trump event, but we've been invited in by the Trump people.
[00:50:32.245 --> 00:50:33.005]  I'd have covered as well.
[00:50:33.065 --> 00:50:34.966]  A true populist action.
[00:50:35.406 --> 00:50:37.707]  That's a big plus in the Trump column.
[00:50:37.967 --> 00:50:46.131]  So we're going to have the raw free feed, commercial free, at Infowars.com forward slash show, of that separately.
[00:50:47.031 --> 00:50:58.456]  We're also going to have a fusion feed that you're watching right now that's the main feed of the Fox debate with the other Republicans, the Trump debate coming up, and I talked to one of his chief people, Mr. Stone, earlier today.
[00:50:58.476 --> 00:51:00.737]  You just saw that in the nightly news, a rebroadcast of that.
[00:51:01.890 --> 00:51:02.210]  I think so.
[00:51:22.968 --> 00:51:32.612]  The CNN version of the Trump deal, our live feed, and then the Fusion feed that I mentioned earlier, the top feed, with Sha'Carri Jackson, Leigh-Anne McAdoo, Darren McBreen.
[00:51:32.632 --> 00:51:42.036]  We're going to have the writers in there in the InfoWars News Center behind us, controlling all of this, popping in with tweets, comments, their own analysis.
[00:51:42.076 --> 00:51:47.939]  In fact, whenever they want to jump in, during the live Mystery Science Political Science Theater.
[00:51:48.459 --> 00:51:49.020]  Yes, exactly.
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:49.681]  I can never get it right.
[00:51:49.721 --> 00:51:50.923]  There's no teleprompters.
[00:51:50.963 --> 00:51:51.203]  3K.
[00:51:51.644 --> 00:51:55.911]  We are going to have them popping in as well during the transmission.
[00:51:56.171 --> 00:51:59.736]  So again, to be clear, this always gets confusing because we give people so many options.
[00:52:01.351 --> 00:52:03.653]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:52:03.693 --> 00:52:07.376]  You'll find the main feed where we analyze the Fox Republican debate.
[00:52:08.076 --> 00:52:11.359]  Our own feed that's going to be up there fed in of the Trump deal.
[00:52:11.639 --> 00:52:13.260]  The CNN version of the Trump deal.
[00:52:13.661 --> 00:52:20.566]  And our reporter Richard Reeves and our other reporters on the ground in Iowa for the big caucuses now about three and a half days away.
[00:52:20.866 --> 00:52:22.948]  Then we have the separate raw Trump feed.
[00:52:23.208 --> 00:52:28.032]  Then we have today's earlier feed of the radio show all at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:52:28.292 --> 00:52:31.234]  I'm going to stop ranting and I'm going to go to Leanne McAdoo
[00:52:31.474 --> 00:52:38.497]  Well, as far as the situation we see going on with Fox News right now, as we saw in the last debate when Rand Paul decided to step out, he got more attention on his own platform than he did on Fox News.
[00:52:52.862 --> 00:52:58.888]  To be fair, Trump does get a lot more air time, so you could debate how much this is going to help or hurt his campaign.
[00:52:59.269 --> 00:53:05.335]  But personally, while he does say some things that I do agree with, I'm not personally a fan of Donald Trump.
[00:53:05.375 --> 00:53:13.924]  He said in the first debates that his issue was that he's pretty much the man behind the curtain, because we always talk about the guy in politics, the man behind the curtain, the guy who's really pulling the strings.
[00:53:14.184 --> 00:53:14.524]  We're roughed up.
[00:53:34.218 --> 00:53:37.080]  Well yeah, I mean, so you're saying you're not ready to cut out the middleman?
[00:53:37.581 --> 00:53:50.531]  You still like sort of having the politicians there to... No, I'm not saying I want the man behind the curtain or the puppet politicians, but I'm saying I'm not sure if I want this guy just to be directly, you know, greasing the skids and hitting on the court.
[00:53:50.911 --> 00:53:52.872]  Well, and that's what I can't, I can't figure out.
[00:53:52.912 --> 00:53:56.215]  It seems, you know, I mean, here we work at InfoWars.
[00:53:56.255 --> 00:53:57.776]  We know that they're always playing games.
[00:53:58.196 --> 00:54:07.042]  So, for me, I just can't tell if there is some sort of reverse psychology going on with Trump saying, I'm going to do this at the exact same time as Fox News.
[00:54:07.122 --> 00:54:10.144]  And it's really going to boost ratings for everyone all around.
[00:54:10.284 --> 00:54:12.625]  Obviously, everyone's going to be wanting to see what Trump has to do.
[00:54:12.926 --> 00:54:17.208]  But then they're going to go back to Fox News to see how they respond and how they're handling it.
[00:54:18.149 --> 00:54:19.250]  You know, there's just no telling.
[00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:20.731]  It is a lot of showmanship.
[00:54:21.071 --> 00:54:22.712]  What do you think, Jakar, about what she just said?
[00:54:23.212 --> 00:54:28.515]  Well, yeah, I mean, of course, as I said earlier, you know, you can debate whether or not this can be a good move because he does get a lot of airtime.
[00:54:28.535 --> 00:54:30.977]  You know, even when it cuts commercial, they show pictures of Trump.
[00:54:31.017 --> 00:54:35.760]  You know, he's definitely the guy that they choose to favor as far as Fox News' angle on it.
[00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:37.100]  Of course, they're going to attack him for this.
[00:54:37.141 --> 00:54:39.622]  You know, this is good fodder for people like Megyn Kelly.
[00:54:39.802 --> 00:54:42.224]  Of course, O'Reilly, he was on O'Reilly last night.
[00:54:42.244 --> 00:54:44.765]  So he's given them a lot to talk about without even being there.
[00:54:44.805 --> 00:54:47.667]  So in that way, it does somewhat favor Fox News.
[00:54:48.171 --> 00:54:52.372]  It'll be interesting to see how they're able to twist the narrative now.
[00:54:52.712 --> 00:54:54.953]  Because they're obviously, they've been painting him as the villain.
[00:54:55.333 --> 00:54:58.273]  But now they're saying, ooh, Iowans, he doesn't like you either.
[00:54:58.333 --> 00:54:59.914]  He's being disrespectful to you.
[00:55:00.054 --> 00:55:05.435]  And just to sort of see how they're going to try and twist the narrative to get people to finally turn against him.
[00:55:05.855 --> 00:55:06.835]  They've been really working.
[00:55:06.855 --> 00:55:07.036]  Sure.
[00:55:07.276 --> 00:55:10.056]  Everything he said, you know, hasn't done that so far.
[00:55:10.116 --> 00:55:12.377]  So it'll be interesting to see after this.
[00:55:12.397 --> 00:55:14.857]  I want your take on what I'm about to say.
[00:55:15.117 --> 00:55:16.858]  I'm going to try to codify this just in a minute or two.
[00:55:18.407 --> 00:55:24.070]  When Trump first came on the scene eight, nine months ago for president, I was still a big Rand Paul supporter because I know he's for real.
[00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:24.770]  I've known him 20 years.
[00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:28.112]  Doesn't mean I agree with everything he stands for and what he does, but I know he's for real.
[00:55:28.372 --> 00:55:29.212]  And I know his dad.
[00:55:29.252 --> 00:55:29.993]  His dad was on today.
[00:55:30.833 --> 00:55:31.653]  He was on two weeks ago.
[00:55:33.394 --> 00:55:41.238]  But that said, I didn't trust Trump because what I knew about him was the big tycoon, the media owner, you know, the casino owner.
[00:55:42.944 --> 00:55:48.570]  But then when I saw establishment money line up from Republicans and Democrats against him.
[00:55:49.031 --> 00:55:54.077]  And when I saw demonization campaigns and them taking out of context what he said over and over again.
[00:55:55.968 --> 00:55:58.911]  It really started to say, hey, maybe he's for real.
[00:55:59.572 --> 00:56:08.624]  And then when they reached out to us through Stone, who's been basically a shadow manager and before was this actual guy running Trump and his campaign.
[00:56:08.644 --> 00:56:10.246]  I was like, whoa.
[00:56:11.407 --> 00:56:12.208]  And the fact that.
[00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:19.454]  Trump says he wants to make these global corporations that don't pay taxes come back here, things like that.
[00:56:19.474 --> 00:56:22.876]  The fact that he says we made terrible deals with China and everybody else, which is true.
[00:56:22.896 --> 00:56:33.382]  The fact that he says he wants to make America great again, that is a direct contravention with the globalist plan, where they tell every country, you're not getting air conditioning or cars if you're in Africa.
[00:56:33.682 --> 00:56:37.264]  And here in America, you're going to lose those cars and air conditioning while they're all up there.
[00:56:39.105 --> 00:56:46.010]  Direct opposition to the austerity of agenda 21 and neo-feudalistic fascism that is the eugenics goal.
[00:56:46.471 --> 00:56:50.354]  Now, that said, making him the underdog, they know how unpopular he is.
[00:56:50.394 --> 00:56:52.135]  Maybe doing that, they know, makes him popular.
[00:56:52.415 --> 00:56:54.037]  And I'll say this, if he is a Jodescope,
[00:56:54.813 --> 00:57:00.555]  If he is a Benedict Arnold, and not a wannabe George Washington, he won't be able to hide anywhere in the world.
[00:57:00.856 --> 00:57:06.278]  He will be hated so much, because the political anger this cycle, isn't like past ones, and every analyst admits that.
[00:57:06.298 --> 00:57:08.539]  9% approval rating for Congress, U.S.
[00:57:08.579 --> 00:57:11.260]  government, biggest threat to American citizens in Gallup poll.
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:19.263]  If Trump tries to run a scam, like other people have done, or he claims somebody threatens his family, like Perot did in Steps Down in 92,
[00:57:21.124 --> 00:57:24.486]  He will destroy his legacy, his name, and everything forever.
[00:57:24.946 --> 00:57:26.808]  And bottom line, he likes to win.
[00:57:26.868 --> 00:57:27.928]  He likes the art of the deal.
[00:57:27.988 --> 00:57:30.870]  He obviously is aggressive, somewhat narcissistic.
[00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:31.290]  Who isn't?
[00:57:31.310 --> 00:57:32.031]  Who's successful?
[00:57:32.551 --> 00:57:35.033]  And the inside baseball I have is, no, he's for real.
[00:57:35.773 --> 00:57:37.594]  He doesn't like seeing America collapse.
[00:57:37.654 --> 00:57:40.156]  He wants to save it and be the turnaround guy.
[00:57:40.836 --> 00:57:41.416]  That's right.
[00:58:02.603 --> 00:58:05.624]  To reach out to me behind the scenes, try to get the patriot vote.
[00:58:05.744 --> 00:58:06.604]  Man, he's something else.
[00:58:06.864 --> 00:58:10.866]  Because most of these people, even if I know they're closet patriots, they don't want to admit it.
[00:58:10.906 --> 00:58:12.046]  They want to talk to me behind the scenes.
[00:58:12.406 --> 00:58:14.267]  Trump's willing to put his money where his mouth is.
[00:58:14.307 --> 00:58:16.388]  So, here's the bottom line, Jakari and Leigh-Anne.
[00:58:16.828 --> 00:58:17.488]  We don't know.
[00:58:17.508 --> 00:58:19.369]  It's like the Super Bowl coming up in two weeks.
[00:58:19.389 --> 00:58:20.309]  We don't know who's going to win that.
[00:58:21.029 --> 00:58:22.790]  We don't know if he's for real or not.
[00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:29.932]  If he gets in, starts doing the right things, and gets shot like Ronald Reagan, because they were after him, then we know he's for real.
[00:58:29.952 --> 00:58:30.932]  Doesn't mean he's perfect.
[00:58:31.132 --> 00:58:37.654]  But I agree, he said things like, I'm the biggest militarist you know, we'll have tons of spying to keep us safe, I'm the man behind the curtain.
[00:58:38.234 --> 00:58:42.895]  He said in one column, five or six things I hate, the other column, a hundred things I like.
[00:58:43.255 --> 00:58:50.077]  The difference is, I know these other candidates either are establishment goons, saying what we want to hear, or, or,
[00:58:52.335 --> 00:58:56.056]  They just don't have what it takes to get in there and fight and get the leadership position.
[00:58:56.076 --> 00:59:01.297]  So then, I have to morally default and say, I don't completely trust Trump, but here's the deal.
[00:59:01.497 --> 00:59:05.458]  I know Jeb Bush and his literal Nazi fortune family.
[00:59:05.498 --> 00:59:06.179]  Look them up, folks.
[00:59:06.199 --> 00:59:07.139]  That's why they're so powerful.
[00:59:07.439 --> 00:59:10.220]  And the son runs the CIA out of nowhere, Herbert Walker.
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:12.380]  And I know Hillary is pure evil.
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:15.121]  I know they're both in the same league, same team.
[00:59:15.161 --> 00:59:16.141]  They call each other family.
[00:59:16.341 --> 00:59:17.242]  So I know they're bad.
[00:59:17.262 --> 00:59:18.662]  And I don't go for lesser of two evils.
[00:59:19.585 --> 00:59:21.726]  But in a position like that, you've got to ask yourself.
[00:59:21.966 --> 00:59:23.126]  Quick comment from both of you.
[00:59:23.146 --> 00:59:27.768]  They're about to go into the, you know, pregame here with the Republican debate on Fox, the Trump event.
[00:59:27.788 --> 00:59:28.668]  Let's punch it back up.
[00:59:28.708 --> 00:59:29.289]  We'll go to that.
[00:59:29.749 --> 00:59:31.949]  I think we're mainly going to cover Trump tonight, back and forth.
[00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:34.470]  But Jakari, your comment on my rant right there.
[00:59:34.530 --> 00:59:36.031]  Yeah, I mean, I respect Trump's boldness.
[00:59:36.051 --> 00:59:44.114]  And just like he said, he has said some things I do agree with, but he also said some things I very much disagree with, you know, such as he wants to enforce the no-fly, no
[00:59:44.634 --> 00:59:50.919]  No buy list, you know, and that's something that we've heavily documented here, all the kids that can't fly on planes because they have a name similar to a terrorist.
[00:59:50.939 --> 00:59:52.440]  Hold on, I didn't know he supported that.
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:53.681]  That's my understanding.
[00:59:53.741 --> 00:59:55.642]  I can't keep, I believe he's a cigar, you're a news town.
[00:59:55.903 --> 00:59:58.385]  Well that, whoa, I'll bring that up next time I talk to him.
[00:59:58.465 --> 00:59:58.645]  Wow.
[01:00:00.188 --> 01:00:00.568]  Wow.
[01:00:01.089 --> 01:00:02.370]  You know, they'll throw a question at him too.
[01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:04.051]  He'll say, yeah, I don't want terrorists having guns.
[01:00:04.091 --> 01:00:04.371]  Yeah.
[01:00:04.631 --> 01:00:05.712]  But no, you're not a terrorist.
[01:00:05.772 --> 01:00:06.393]  No fly list.
[01:00:07.393 --> 01:00:08.934]  A lot of people, they just put you on it.
[01:00:09.295 --> 01:00:12.157]  You know, a lot of people are ignorant to it, including politicians.
[01:00:12.197 --> 01:00:12.397]  Yeah.
[01:00:12.417 --> 01:00:15.319]  They don't step back and go, well, wait a minute, there's a three year old on that list.
[01:00:15.379 --> 01:00:16.080]  So how'd she get on it?
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:16.780]  That's a great point though.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:17.000]  Go ahead.
[01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:21.342]  Well, and I just I appreciate how we are sort of seeing the establishment.
[01:00:21.962 --> 01:00:23.943]  First of all, we're seeing the establishment media crumble.
[01:00:24.063 --> 01:00:27.784]  Their power is, I mean, everyone can see that they're meaningless.
[01:00:27.804 --> 01:00:30.805]  They're not choosing who we should pick at this point.
[01:00:31.165 --> 01:00:32.185]  And Trump showing them that.
[01:00:32.325 --> 01:00:33.846]  Rand Paul showed them that last week.
[01:00:34.106 --> 01:00:36.967]  So I appreciate watching the crumbling of the establishment.
[01:00:37.287 --> 01:00:43.509]  And it is also interesting to see how we had Financial Times and other people come out and say, we've got to take Trump out.
[01:00:43.649 --> 01:00:47.612]  Saying the super elite have got to take Trump down.
[01:00:48.152 --> 01:00:48.593]  Exactly.
[01:00:48.633 --> 01:00:49.453]  You just said it, Leigh-Anne.
[01:00:49.654 --> 01:00:52.156]  Whether he's real or not, they don't like what's happening.
[01:00:52.216 --> 01:00:52.896]  It's wreaking havoc.
[01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:54.317]  They're hitting the panic button for real.
[01:00:54.377 --> 01:00:55.098]  I know how to study it.
[01:00:55.338 --> 01:00:56.439]  They're not just saying it in rhetoric.
[01:00:56.479 --> 01:00:59.061]  Behind the scenes, they are, you know what, in their pants.
[01:00:59.261 --> 01:01:04.365]  We're going to go to break and come back as the Trump event kicks off, as Fox News has their other debate.
[01:01:04.845 --> 01:01:09.269]  It's all coming up with Jakari Jackson, Leigh-Anne McAdoo, Alex Jones, Darren McBrain and our great crew.
[01:01:09.369 --> 01:01:13.352]  And you, straight ahead, send your questions in to Twitter at RealAlexJones.
[01:01:19.821 --> 01:01:22.232]  They're popping in my ears saying go to break, so I'm doing it.
[01:02:14.042 --> 01:02:15.703]  The knowledge of the ancients.
[01:02:16.023 --> 01:02:19.604]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[01:02:19.844 --> 01:02:22.465]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[01:02:22.766 --> 01:02:26.187]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[01:02:26.407 --> 01:02:31.089]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge
[01:02:31.209 --> 01:02:31.449]  I'm good.

[01:03:08.768 --> 01:03:09.449]  That's ancientdefense.com.
[01:03:41.343 --> 01:03:42.443]  It's never going to get any better.
[01:03:42.844 --> 01:03:43.564]  Don't look for it.
[01:03:44.004 --> 01:03:45.124]  Be happy with what you got.
[01:03:46.265 --> 01:03:49.326]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[01:03:49.886 --> 01:03:51.527]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[01:03:51.927 --> 01:03:52.967]  The real owners.
[01:03:53.047 --> 01:03:57.569]  The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[01:03:57.949 --> 01:03:59.189]  Forget the politicians.
[01:03:59.409 --> 01:04:02.691]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[01:04:04.251 --> 01:04:04.671]  You don't.
[01:04:05.472 --> 01:04:06.452]  You have no choice.
[01:04:06.832 --> 01:04:07.772]  You have owners.
[01:04:08.072 --> 01:04:08.993]  They own you.
[01:04:10.339 --> 01:04:11.620]  They own everything.
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.520]  They own all the important land.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.621]  They own and control the corporations.
[01:04:15.641 --> 01:04:19.122]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, the City Halls.
[01:04:19.142 --> 01:04:20.723]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[01:04:21.043 --> 01:04:25.865]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[01:04:26.045 --> 01:04:27.666]  They got you by the balls!
[01:04:29.164 --> 01:04:31.245]  They want obedient workers.
[01:04:31.285 --> 01:04:33.206]  Obedient workers.
[01:04:33.526 --> 01:04:46.232]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[01:04:46.292 --> 01:04:49.553]  And now, they're coming for your social security money.
[01:04:50.014 --> 01:04:52.675]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[01:04:54.095 --> 01:04:54.976]  It's a big club.
[01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.831]  And you ain't in it.
[01:04:57.391 --> 01:05:00.092]  You and I are not in the big club.
[01:05:00.473 --> 01:05:02.414]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[01:05:03.054 --> 01:05:06.776]  It's called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[01:05:08.197 --> 01:05:09.698]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[01:05:10.058 --> 01:05:13.540]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:17.482]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[01:05:17.502 --> 01:05:18.443]  They're not interested in that.
[01:05:18.743 --> 01:05:19.683]  That doesn't help them.
[01:05:20.064 --> 01:05:21.464]  That's against their interest.
[01:05:21.945 --> 01:05:22.325]  That's right.
[01:05:32.119 --> 01:05:35.743]  And folks, we are live broadcasting and transmitting worldwide.
[01:05:36.183 --> 01:05:38.105]  I am your host, Alex Jones, teleprompter free.
[01:05:38.686 --> 01:05:45.472]  We've just seen Megyn Kelly looking like she is an alien leader invader with her I'm not a bimbo short haircut.
[01:05:45.833 --> 01:05:47.154]  She's a fan of Janet Reno.
[01:05:47.174 --> 01:05:49.136]  I'm just having fun.
[01:05:49.176 --> 01:05:51.158]  I think it's Megyn Kelly, but just give me a break.
[01:05:51.658 --> 01:05:54.001]  Actually, I actually am Janet Reno.
[01:05:54.922 --> 01:05:55.662]  We're good to go.
[01:06:16.758 --> 01:06:17.359]  Never fear!
[01:06:17.839 --> 01:06:23.165]  The Trump folks gave us another feed that we can go to if our own feed cuts out, so we've got that as backup.
[01:06:23.185 --> 01:06:23.885]  Remember that, guys.
[01:06:24.266 --> 01:06:25.147]  We need to have that going.
[01:06:25.327 --> 01:06:27.869]  Because we're doing what other networks dare not do with a skeleton crew.
[01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:39.842]  We've got our own live analysis that everybody's copying, I'm proud of that, big trailblazers, from Glenn Beck to the, you name it, to the Young Turks, you know, giving live analysis to other debates, State of the Union, while they're talking.
[01:06:40.402 --> 01:06:41.243]  Uh, in real time.
[01:06:41.804 --> 01:06:44.146]  And we're also carrying the Trump event.
[01:06:44.486 --> 01:06:47.269]  And somebody's coming up with a Trump event, uh, right now.
[01:06:47.429 --> 01:06:50.572]  Let's, uh, in just a moment get ready to cut to that Trump feed.
[01:06:50.592 --> 01:06:53.535]  Because, hey, we listen to you, the voters, and the viewers.
[01:06:53.915 --> 01:06:58.360]  You'll get some Fox tonight, but we're gonna get the trailblazer Donald Trump, regardless of what you think about him.
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:02.384]  He's the one that bolted to absolutely smash the mainstream media.
[01:07:02.684 --> 01:07:04.345]  And Trump is about to come out.
[01:07:05.286 --> 01:07:10.228]  We've got this Skype feed over here that again we're going to be going to in just a moment.
[01:07:10.248 --> 01:07:13.329]  Because hey, when this all comes out, Cena normally has horrible ratings.
[01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:18.071]  I bet you they end up with better ratings than Fox does tonight overall.
[01:07:18.271 --> 01:07:25.254]  If you add all the video streams and shows like ours up, you know, the guy that says, book him Dan-O on Fox, we can punch him up.
[01:07:25.594 --> 01:07:26.595]  There's Dan-O!
[01:07:27.255 --> 01:07:30.316]  They froze him when Y5O was cancelled and they brought him back.
[01:07:30.696 --> 01:07:31.397]  So Dan-O!
[01:07:33.177 --> 01:07:37.618]  Dano is not going to get as many viewers as Donald Trump is teleprompter-free.
[01:07:37.658 --> 01:07:41.419]  That'll be interesting to see what sort of, you know, money they get from the commercials as well.
[01:07:41.579 --> 01:07:45.721]  Did you know they have huge six-and-a-half-foot bobbleheads called Jeb Bush they put on TV?
[01:07:46.681 --> 01:07:47.101]  Oh, Jeb.
[01:07:47.121 --> 01:07:48.641]  That's Jeb and he earned it.
[01:07:48.781 --> 01:07:52.643]  Yeah, put an exclamation point behind his name to get some excitement going.
[01:07:52.743 --> 01:07:53.983]  All right, Trump has come out.
[01:07:54.023 --> 01:07:58.184]  Let's see here and see what our audio feed is and video feed is to the Trump feed.
[01:07:58.204 --> 01:08:00.905]  And if ours isn't good, let's go to the C-SPAN feed.
[01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:03.441]  Uh, yeah.
[01:08:03.601 --> 01:08:05.342]  It's just music at the moment, seems like.
[01:08:05.882 --> 01:08:06.903]  It's just music at the moment.
[01:08:06.943 --> 01:08:09.884]  All right, we are... And again, notice Trump knows how to wait.
[01:08:09.905 --> 01:08:12.826]  I guess he read, I'll be honest, Joseph Gerbel's book.
[01:08:13.126 --> 01:08:18.429]  I mean, he knows to make people wait a little bit, you know, before you bring them out to create the anticipation.
[01:08:18.449 --> 01:08:20.350]  Leigh-Anne, your real take on Trump.
[01:08:20.370 --> 01:08:20.971]  Give me your real take.
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:28.003]  Well, when he first, the first debate, when he admitted that he buys off the politicians, I was like, really?
[01:08:28.503 --> 01:08:33.746]  This is the man that we are all against who has bought and paid off the politicians.
[01:08:33.766 --> 01:08:34.626]  He's lower level.
[01:08:34.666 --> 01:08:36.187]  He was saying, I buy it, I buy it.
[01:08:36.267 --> 01:08:38.768]  And like Jakari said, I appreciate his honesty with that.
[01:08:38.888 --> 01:08:43.710]  However, the more that he talks, I know the more he talks, most people hate him.
[01:08:44.071 --> 01:08:47.612]  The more he talks, I start to like him because I'm like, oh, I just love him.
[01:08:47.632 --> 01:08:49.073]  The more he talks, the more people like him.
[01:08:49.093 --> 01:08:50.173]  I love the ruffled feathers.
[01:08:50.214 --> 01:08:50.834]  I just, I can't.
[01:08:51.434 --> 01:08:52.875]  It is fun to see a train wreck, isn't it?
[01:08:52.955 --> 01:08:53.375]  It is!
[01:08:53.996 --> 01:08:54.516]  Dicari?
[01:08:56.518 --> 01:09:17.612]  With Trump, you know, one of the other things he said that was quite shocking to me, once again I respect his honesty for it, but when he said we want to create the, or embolden the domestic surveillance state, and he says people are going to complain, talk about first men, first men, we have to pretty much ignore those voices, that was very concerning to me, because if a politician says they're going to make you more free, I'm skeptical,
[01:09:18.832 --> 01:09:21.396]  Excuse me, if they say they're gonna make you less free, I do believe them.
[01:09:21.436 --> 01:09:21.576]  Right.
[01:09:22.057 --> 01:09:22.457]  Exactly.
[01:09:22.477 --> 01:09:24.020]  They tell you they're gonna take your rights.
[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:24.921]  Believe them!
[01:09:25.081 --> 01:09:26.183]  They're gonna take your rights.
[01:09:26.223 --> 01:09:27.144]  Well, I think Trump...
[01:09:28.206 --> 01:09:35.049]  Overall has got the system scared, the Bilderberg Group coming out, the Financial Times 1 saying defeat him because he does scare them.
[01:09:35.069 --> 01:09:39.211]  They don't know who he is and they think he actually wants the power and they've already got it.
[01:09:39.771 --> 01:09:40.972]  So I kind of say gamble.
[01:09:41.012 --> 01:09:45.593]  Why not just have some guy up there that we all know what he's doing instead of these shadowy groups behind the scenes.
[01:09:45.634 --> 01:09:49.135]  That's why, here's the deal, I used to be against constitutional convention.
[01:09:50.195 --> 01:09:53.537]  They got senators on TV going, we're passing international martial law.
[01:09:55.563 --> 01:09:59.167]  And so at a certain point, I'm just like, you know, what does it even matter anymore?
[01:09:59.687 --> 01:10:01.269]  I'm not ready to gamble on Trump.
[01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:05.733]  It's just that he's doing a lot of things that I agree with, but that remains to be seen.
[01:10:05.753 --> 01:10:11.019]  Yeah, I would love someone to print out that Financial Times article for me, just to kind of read off some of the things.
[01:10:11.039 --> 01:10:14.102]  I mean, it was insane what he was calling for.
[01:10:14.122 --> 01:10:16.584]  It was like a coded message to the elite.
[01:10:17.205 --> 01:10:20.266]  We need someone in there who's... Well, it said the super class, the super elite.
[01:10:20.546 --> 01:10:21.946]  These are quotes that need to stop Trump.
[01:10:21.966 --> 01:10:26.887]  He's riling up all of the people that we've been trying to suppress is what is the gist of this.
[01:10:26.967 --> 01:10:27.587]  It's all our work.
[01:10:27.607 --> 01:10:28.248]  In fact, I meant to get that.
[01:10:28.268 --> 01:10:35.309]  Will you guys try to pull that up and maybe put it... We don't want to put it over Trump, but we want to put it over Dano on Fox.
[01:10:35.389 --> 01:10:35.989]  I'm not being mean.
[01:10:36.049 --> 01:10:36.770]  Is this like Dano?
[01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:37.650]  It looks like Dano.
[01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:38.490]  Welcome, Dano!
[01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:41.091]  You know, we got you.
[01:10:41.491 --> 01:10:42.631]  Let me admit it, I robbed the bank.
[01:10:42.711 --> 01:10:43.171]  That's right.
[01:10:43.851 --> 01:10:44.431]  I'm McGarrett.
[01:10:44.632 --> 01:10:45.392]  Welcome, Dano.
[01:10:45.932 --> 01:10:46.132]  So...
[01:10:47.342 --> 01:10:49.945]  I need a side-by-side, because I don't know who you're talking about.
[01:10:49.985 --> 01:10:52.948]  Well, you're a little bit younger, but the point is, is that there it is.
[01:10:53.428 --> 01:10:58.493]  State leader surprises lawmakers, or Senate leader, with new ISIS war powers.
[01:10:58.513 --> 01:11:02.998]  What we want is Bilderberg elite say superclass must stop Donald Trump.
[01:11:03.098 --> 01:11:03.278]  Right.
[01:11:03.398 --> 01:11:05.100]  It's an Infowars.com article.
[01:11:05.701 --> 01:11:05.921]  Yeah.
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:11.462]  Again, we link over in it to the Financial Times of London.
[01:11:11.482 --> 01:11:11.842]  There it is.
[01:11:12.102 --> 01:11:12.342]  Right.
[01:11:12.583 --> 01:11:13.423]  In fact, let's scroll through it.
[01:11:13.443 --> 01:11:14.264]  Top Bilderberg.
[01:11:14.664 --> 01:11:17.045]  Global elite must stop Donald Trump.
[01:11:17.065 --> 01:11:18.366]  See, we're hijacking the media.
[01:11:18.626 --> 01:11:22.209]  We're not hearing Dano ask the questions here of the Republican bobbleheads.
[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:23.860]  We're just talking about the debate.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:24.821]  We're going to show you what they said.
[01:11:25.361 --> 01:11:26.261]  Here we go.
[01:11:26.301 --> 01:11:34.464]  His close friends, many influential central bankers, and his editorial is called, The Economic Losers Are In Revolt Against The Elites.
[01:11:35.084 --> 01:11:44.828]  And he's basically talking about how the losers have rejected the elites that dominate the economic and cultural lives of their countries, and the potential consequences are frightening.
[01:11:45.108 --> 01:11:49.949]  And it already might be too late to stop the wave of populism that Trump has spearheaded.
[01:11:50.509 --> 01:11:51.790]  And it goes on to just
[01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:53.070]  Exactly.
[01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:54.091]  We must stop this.
[01:11:54.211 --> 01:12:03.756]  He is calling on populism, which they've been doing everything to domesticate us with the nanny state, to kill the people with the pitchforks going after Frankenstein's castle.
[01:12:03.976 --> 01:12:04.197]  Yeah.
[01:12:04.417 --> 01:12:11.180]  And so everything they've done since the 60s is to co-opt protests, control it, you know, do off.
[01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:13.642]  They took the left, put them in charge of the tyranny, so they go away.
[01:12:14.795 --> 01:12:17.456]  And so you hit the nail on the head.
[01:12:17.756 --> 01:12:21.398]  He is stoking fires of liberty, whether he's real or not.
[01:12:21.738 --> 01:12:22.499]  That's why they hate him.
[01:12:22.519 --> 01:12:33.264]  And let me tell you, that's why he must be real, or at least rogue, is because they don't like what he's doing, and it's coffin nails to them in a big, fat, gigantic, juicy,
[01:12:33.604 --> 01:12:33.844]  Way.
[01:12:33.864 --> 01:12:35.104]  I want to get Jakari's take on that.
[01:12:35.124 --> 01:12:36.065]  We're waiting for Trump to come up.
[01:12:36.305 --> 01:12:42.247]  We'll put a little bit of the Fox so-called debate, the sacrifice, crucify Trump event, that he was smart enough to not be part of.
[01:12:42.527 --> 01:12:47.128]  But Darren McBrain, you're going to be giving us analysis throughout the night as well.
[01:12:47.428 --> 01:12:49.889]  What's your take on what Jakari, Leigh-Anne, and I just said?
[01:12:50.987 --> 01:12:52.910]  Well, I think it's a very exciting broadcast today.
[01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:59.038]  I think we're witnessing history, Alex, because the conservative base, they're jumping ship right now, right?
[01:12:59.078 --> 01:13:00.920]  I mean, they're finally starting to wake up.
[01:13:01.221 --> 01:13:02.042]  They're jumping ship.
[01:13:02.082 --> 01:13:04.285]  They're abandoning Fox News.
[01:13:04.525 --> 01:13:07.069]  So I think that's the first time we've ever seen that.
[01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:08.149]  Exactly.
[01:13:08.169 --> 01:13:10.410]  I'm going to interrupt the classic Alex Jones teleprompter for you.
[01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:10.990]  You're absolutely right.
[01:13:11.250 --> 01:13:14.871]  They're jumping ship to Trump because they want off that neocon ship.
[01:13:14.951 --> 01:13:18.152]  Even if Trump has got holes in the bottom, they're going to jump in another ship.
[01:13:18.572 --> 01:13:21.333]  The point is, they're off the plantation, they're off the reservation.
[01:13:21.673 --> 01:13:22.114]  Exactly.
[01:13:22.134 --> 01:13:31.076]  When I saw that CNBC debate, when they blew up at the reporters, told them they were scum, and they had their tail between their legs, that just showed what a hollow, rotten structure the mainstream media is.
[01:13:31.116 --> 01:13:32.157]  I'm sorry, McBrain.
[01:13:32.377 --> 01:13:33.717]  You guys are just so on target.
[01:13:33.737 --> 01:13:34.077]  Go ahead.
[01:13:34.637 --> 01:13:36.018]  Well, check this out.
[01:13:36.778 --> 01:13:45.882]  Even Rush Limbaugh, right, he just said today he is now putting Fox News in the same category as the establishment media.
[01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:46.182]  Wow.
[01:13:46.282 --> 01:13:47.423]  I mean, I couldn't believe that.
[01:13:47.483 --> 01:13:52.125]  He talks about Hillary killing people and says she may blow Bernie Sanders' head off yesterday.
[01:13:52.685 --> 01:13:53.646]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:13:54.066 --> 01:13:58.790]  And by the way, everyone, Darren McBreen once again from the Twitter booth here at the Infowars.com studios.
[01:13:58.830 --> 01:14:07.698]  Just want to let you all know that if you want to participate tonight, be sure to go to at real Alex Jones and use the hashtag GOP debate.
[01:14:07.998 --> 01:14:09.340]  I will be monitoring Twitter.
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.802]  I'll be monitoring Facebook for the next couple of hours.
[01:14:11.822 --> 01:14:16.706]  And I'm going to keep a close eye on the Donald Trump event as well as it unfolds.
[01:14:16.726 --> 01:14:17.507]  You know, he's going to have this
[01:14:18.027 --> 01:14:28.876]  Live event at the exact same time so he's pretty much hijacking the networks because only one news network is covering the Fox News debate tonight and that's Fox.
[01:14:29.256 --> 01:14:30.417]  Where's everybody else going to be?
[01:14:30.477 --> 01:14:39.804]  All the other networks are going to be watching the Trump event so he's hijacked the networks and he's also the talk of the town on social media and on the internet.
[01:14:40.144 --> 01:14:41.746]  And Trump is so smart
[01:14:42.446 --> 01:14:48.710]  He had his communications director call Richard Reeves this morning in Iowa and say, come on in here and do your feed too.
[01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:51.472]  And it's not just us, it's hundreds of other alternative media.
[01:14:51.912 --> 01:14:54.774]  I mean, you know, that's the opposite of the arrogance.
[01:14:54.814 --> 01:14:59.717]  I mean, I tell you, I tell you, I mean, it's just, it's strange because I know we have a giant audience.
[01:14:59.757 --> 01:15:00.838]  We don't need mainstream media.
[01:15:00.858 --> 01:15:01.518]  We make fun of them.
[01:15:01.838 --> 01:15:04.020]  Trump is smart enough to get there already dead.
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:05.981]  I mean, they're John Kasich.
[01:15:06.421 --> 01:15:08.502]  They're shoveling, feeding us right now.
[01:15:08.962 --> 01:15:10.703]  I mean, is there no end to this garbage?
[01:15:10.723 --> 01:15:14.765]  Like we've been talking about for the past couple debates, like when Rand Paul broke off, he did his own thing.
[01:15:14.845 --> 01:15:23.810]  I am happy to see the candidates, regardless of how I feel about their positions, breaking off and doing their own thing and saying that we don't need your mainstream media narrative to get our messages out.
[01:15:23.850 --> 01:15:25.190]  We can do our Facebook missions.
[01:15:25.450 --> 01:15:27.691]  We can rent a ballroom and have our own event.
[01:15:27.712 --> 01:15:28.412]  And I think that's great.
[01:15:28.772 --> 01:15:31.273]  This is like, what a time to be alive.
[01:15:31.794 --> 01:15:38.717]  You know, did you ever, I know that you always say this, so you've truly believed in your lifetime you would see the fall of the establishment.
[01:15:39.137 --> 01:15:41.018]  But we are witnessing it right now.
[01:15:41.038 --> 01:15:42.039]  I mean, it is happening.
[01:15:42.359 --> 01:15:44.060]  And it is due to the internet.
[01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:45.381]  This is why they want to control it.
[01:15:45.401 --> 01:15:46.581]  This is why they want to shut it down.
[01:15:46.641 --> 01:15:54.386]  They don't want those alternative voices out there that are taking, stealing the narrative, and throwing it in their face, doing the live news analysis.
[01:15:54.406 --> 01:15:55.026]  Well, look at you.
[01:15:55.066 --> 01:15:56.807]  You're smarter and better looking than Megyn Kelly.
[01:15:57.287 --> 01:15:58.048]  I'm not just saying that.
[01:15:58.068 --> 01:16:00.991]  You're like ten times better looking than her and five times smarter.
[01:16:01.431 --> 01:16:02.272]  And I'm not lying.
[01:16:02.713 --> 01:16:03.493]  I mean, look at Jakari.
[01:16:03.854 --> 01:16:05.595]  Smarter, quicker, better looking than these.
[01:16:05.635 --> 01:16:07.217]  Look at this idiot Kasich up here.
[01:16:07.537 --> 01:16:08.779]  Make Jakari governor.
[01:16:08.839 --> 01:16:10.320]  I mean, I'm serious.
[01:16:10.681 --> 01:16:11.281]  I'm serious.
[01:16:13.863 --> 01:16:17.406]  I mean, I'm telling you, they're done.
[01:16:17.866 --> 01:16:19.707]  They can only rule in a rig game.
[01:16:20.067 --> 01:16:21.808]  And Trump's just a sign that they're screwed.
[01:16:22.089 --> 01:16:26.511]  And again, we're over here with the Trump feed, right now, as soon as that comes up, and we have C-SPAN back up.
[01:16:26.631 --> 01:16:29.633]  And let's not forget, we've also got David Knight and Joe Biggs, don't we?
[01:16:29.873 --> 01:16:31.054]  I know we saw them earlier.
[01:16:32.575 --> 01:16:33.797]  And you know what's great about that?
[01:16:33.837 --> 01:16:37.402]  We got David and them out covering the Oregon standoff, you know, out there.
[01:16:37.422 --> 01:16:42.770]  I mean, we're a real news organization that actually wears our bias of telling the truth on our sleeve.
[01:16:44.096 --> 01:16:46.797]  Let's play just a little bit of Ben Carson from Fox.
[01:16:46.817 --> 01:17:09.166]  We're going to analyze maybe a minute or two of that, then we're going to go to David Knight for a quick comment, and then as soon as Trump comes out, because let's face it, we're not watching all the, you know, this is the true kids table at Fox News, and they wanted, and then they have the babies table below that, they wanted Trump to come bring his huge audience, a populace there, and try to kill him in front of everybody politically, and Trump's just run over here to blow him out of the water.
[01:17:09.186 --> 01:17:10.667]  But let's hear some of what Ben Carson's saying.
[01:17:11.704 --> 01:17:16.526]  We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems.
[01:17:16.647 --> 01:17:17.307]  Oh, Donald Trump?
[01:17:17.427 --> 01:17:17.827]  InfoWars?
[01:17:17.887 --> 01:17:24.290]  Utilize the resources around them, very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.
[01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:27.572]  No, special interests are in there robbing everything because they're already in control, Ben.
[01:17:27.592 --> 01:17:32.935]  That's why we have this abnormal... And they don't want us to have wealth because then we get too uppity!
[01:17:32.995 --> 01:17:34.135]  Let me explain how this works.
[01:17:34.175 --> 01:17:37.937]  We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation.
[01:17:37.957 --> 01:17:38.898]  The Trump event is starting.
[01:17:39.518 --> 01:17:50.527]  I gotta say, I'm sad that they kind of did their witch hunt with Ben Carson right away and dropped his numbers down because he also is not an... No, he's definitely, definitely a dark horse as well.
[01:17:50.587 --> 01:17:51.468]  Definitely a rogue.
[01:17:51.768 --> 01:17:53.129]  That's why they're killing him politically.
[01:17:53.209 --> 01:17:55.170]  Alright, let's cut off the...
[01:17:55.871 --> 01:17:59.495]  Hillary Clinton financed network that supports Hillary Clinton for right now.
[01:17:59.575 --> 01:18:00.476]  Donald Trump's coming out.
[01:18:00.496 --> 01:18:01.498]  We're going to David Knight later.
[01:18:01.518 --> 01:18:03.019]  Let's go to Donald Trump right now.
[01:18:03.059 --> 01:18:03.700]  Here is the feed.
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:05.642]  Donald Trump on stage.
[01:18:06.383 --> 01:18:07.625]  And we just take it.
[01:18:07.765 --> 01:18:14.753]  We have to stick up for ourselves as people and we have to stick up for our country when we're being mistreated.
[01:18:14.853 --> 01:18:15.334]  Remember that.
[01:18:16.404 --> 01:18:18.006]  And, you know, let's put Fox on the other feed.
[01:18:18.046 --> 01:18:20.889]  We'll just show a wide shot of both things, but they're audio off.
[01:18:20.909 --> 01:18:27.356]  I have to go a step further and say that Fox has been extremely nice, and the last number of hours, actually.
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:32.122]  And they've wanted me there, and they said, how about now?
[01:18:32.142 --> 01:18:33.243]  They called a few minutes ago.
[01:18:33.263 --> 01:18:33.803]  How about now?
[01:18:33.883 --> 01:18:34.464]  Can you come over?
[01:18:34.484 --> 01:18:35.885]  I said, hasn't it already started?
[01:18:36.786 --> 01:18:47.474]  And we actually thought what we'd do is we'd let them start, and, you know, we want it to be about 15 minutes into that hour, so that by now they're all taking the cameras, like the Academy Awards.
[01:18:47.494 --> 01:18:48.675]  This is like the Academy Awards.
[01:18:52.113 --> 01:18:52.633]  Yeah, should be.
[01:18:53.254 --> 01:18:53.574]  Pretty good.
[01:18:53.614 --> 01:18:54.735]  I know this is Mystery of Science.
[01:18:55.275 --> 01:18:57.737]  Political Science Theater 3K.
[01:18:57.977 --> 01:18:58.037]  3K.
[01:18:58.197 --> 01:18:58.277]  3K.
[01:18:58.377 --> 01:18:58.418]  3K.
[01:18:58.438 --> 01:18:59.799]  Teleprompter Free.
[01:18:59.859 --> 01:19:01.560]  It's Political Science Theater 3K.
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:01.760]  Yes.
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:04.702]  That's really in honor of our vets, but they have been.
[01:19:04.722 --> 01:19:06.844]  They've been very nice and they wanted me to go.
[01:19:06.864 --> 01:19:09.185]  Guys, pump the audio in, but let's do wide shot with us in here.
[01:19:09.205 --> 01:19:14.709]  Well, they did apologize and they could not have been, but once this started, it's for our vets, there was nothing I could do.
[01:19:15.330 --> 01:19:15.730]  I don't know.
[01:19:15.970 --> 01:19:17.191]  Yeah, he couldn't have backed out now.
[01:19:17.511 --> 01:19:20.053]  It's three miles away.
[01:19:20.414 --> 01:19:23.856]  I mean, is he going to drive a car over there mid-debate?
[01:19:23.936 --> 01:19:25.378]  That would be sensational.
[01:19:25.498 --> 01:19:27.399]  I just love seeing those arrogant bastards.
[01:19:27.419 --> 01:19:28.220]  Their heads in the ground.
[01:19:31.627 --> 01:19:33.588]  Yeah, 5 million for the veterans.
[01:19:33.608 --> 01:19:35.769]  Because the VA won't take care of them.
[01:19:35.789 --> 01:19:36.210]  Right.
[01:19:36.250 --> 01:19:36.930]  That is true.
[01:19:37.190 --> 01:19:37.991]  That is very true.
[01:19:38.011 --> 01:19:40.712]  Fox News is taking tens of millions from those Wounded Warrior ads.
[01:19:41.112 --> 01:19:42.293]  They make them pay for those ads.
[01:19:42.553 --> 01:19:42.793]  Really?
[01:19:43.013 --> 01:19:43.353]  Yeah.
[01:19:43.373 --> 01:19:44.974]  Just like the Super Bowl has to pay.
[01:19:45.074 --> 01:19:46.555]  You know, for the pro-military stuff?
[01:19:46.575 --> 01:19:47.676]  That's all paid for.
[01:19:47.696 --> 01:19:48.196]  Oh wow.
[01:19:48.516 --> 01:19:54.863]  And he did say, if you give that money that you're going to make to the veterans, he'll come.
[01:19:54.883 --> 01:19:55.684]  And they wouldn't do it.
[01:19:55.704 --> 01:19:57.305]  No, they lied to him when he was first on my show.
[01:19:57.606 --> 01:19:58.587]  They said he wanted the money.
[01:19:58.967 --> 01:20:00.469]  The news was like, Trump wants the money.
[01:20:00.829 --> 01:20:03.672]  So once this ball started rolling, we couldn't stop it.
[01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:08.337]  And you see the houses packed, and literally this took place less than 24 hours.
[01:20:08.377 --> 01:20:09.238]  We had less than 24 hours to do it.
[01:20:09.258 --> 01:20:10.800]  This is just a little bit of the daring.
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:12.861]  I'm not going to do a debate.
[01:20:12.881 --> 01:20:13.802]  I'm not going to do a debate.
[01:20:13.822 --> 01:20:14.562]  I'm not going to do a debate.
[01:20:14.582 --> 01:20:15.303]  I'm not going to do a debate.
[01:20:15.323 --> 01:20:16.184]  I'm not going to do a debate.
[01:20:16.204 --> 01:20:17.305]  I'm not going to do a debate.
[01:20:28.277 --> 01:20:29.638]  She wears one on her head.
[01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:30.859]  Just having some fun, folks.
[01:20:31.119 --> 01:20:31.440]  Sorry.
[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:32.300]  I like Megyn Kelly.
[01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:34.602]  Even though she looks like a tranny.
[01:20:35.103 --> 01:20:38.045]  Alright, I'm sorry.
[01:20:38.065 --> 01:20:39.686]  I'm out of control.
[01:20:39.946 --> 01:20:41.007]  I don't agree with that.
[01:20:41.047 --> 01:20:41.788]  She's too skinny.
[01:20:41.808 --> 01:20:43.369]  She's not like Marilyn Monroe.
[01:20:43.409 --> 01:20:45.311]  Not feminine like certain women out there.
[01:20:45.391 --> 01:20:46.291]  You can't help it.
[01:20:46.331 --> 01:20:47.272]  That's just... I know.
[01:20:47.292 --> 01:20:48.933]  She looks like a man!
[01:20:48.973 --> 01:20:50.074]  Tell us how you really feel, Alex.
[01:20:54.718 --> 01:20:55.918]  More importantly, it's the subjects.
[01:20:55.938 --> 01:20:59.360]  Well, I'm not into women that look like, you know, look, I'm not against gay people.
[01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:04.041]  But they run the fashion industry on record and they like people who look like men.
[01:21:04.081 --> 01:21:05.602]  And those supermodels are skinny.
[01:21:05.842 --> 01:21:08.123]  Well, now, they are some pretty skinny supermodels.
[01:21:08.143 --> 01:21:09.363]  Can we play some Sir Mix-a-Lot?
[01:21:09.463 --> 01:21:11.704]  Alright.
[01:21:11.744 --> 01:21:13.545]  Hey, I'll pull up quick and retrieve it.
[01:21:13.565 --> 01:21:19.427]  I think we'll get a... I think we'll get... Red Beans and Rice-D-Bisser!
[01:21:21.084 --> 01:21:24.025]  I think you'll get a strike on YouTube if we place your mix a lot.
[01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:27.387]  It'll probably be more entertaining than the Fox debate.
[01:21:27.407 --> 01:21:27.747]  I agree.
[01:21:27.887 --> 01:21:29.528]  I'm confident of that.
[01:21:29.908 --> 01:21:31.949]  I'm a little bad at night, I apologize.
[01:21:33.190 --> 01:21:36.632]  Donald Trump, another great builder in New York, now a politician.
[01:21:37.252 --> 01:21:41.154]  I don't want to be called a politician.
[01:21:41.834 --> 01:21:42.995]  All talk, no action.
[01:21:43.095 --> 01:21:44.655]  I refuse to be called a politician.
[01:21:45.016 --> 01:21:47.277]  Donald Trump gave one million dollars, okay?
[01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:53.521]  Just, just, just, get into the hysteria.
[01:21:53.801 --> 01:21:55.682]  Alright, give yourself up.
[01:21:55.822 --> 01:21:58.983]  I'm observing it, I'm trying to see, you know, what it is about it.
[01:21:59.003 --> 01:21:59.444]  I'm joking.
[01:21:59.524 --> 01:22:00.344]  There's Darth Sidious.
[01:22:01.204 --> 01:22:03.505]  So he's had a reading off the donations.
[01:22:03.545 --> 01:22:06.546]  Should we check back in with the JV Debate?
[01:22:06.566 --> 01:22:07.947]  Unlimited!
[01:22:10.194 --> 01:22:12.717]  He's a very, very rich man in New York, a very good friend of mine.
[01:22:12.737 --> 01:22:15.741]  They're claiming that he just wants unlimited power.
[01:22:15.761 --> 01:22:17.263]  Do you think that's really what this is all about?
[01:22:17.344 --> 01:22:18.886]  The globalists already have unlimited power.
[01:22:18.906 --> 01:22:23.071]  So Bloomberg, trying to throw his hat in the ring, wants unlimited power.
[01:22:23.091 --> 01:22:24.553]  Okay, well that's a question, Zucari.
[01:22:25.054 --> 01:22:25.995]  Over Bloomberg.
[01:22:26.035 --> 01:22:27.277]  Would you vote for Trump over Bloomberg?
[01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:45.729]  If I had to choose one or the other, I would pick Donald Trump because I have as many issues I have with Donald Trump, I have many more with Mayor Michael Bloomberg who wants to ban people's sodas and salt and he runs around with armed bodyguards and somebody asked him, hey Mr. Bloomberg, in the spirit of gun control, will you disarm your bodyguards?
[01:22:45.989 --> 01:22:48.611]  He said, hell no, I'm not gonna, well he didn't say that, but that was his mentality.
[01:22:49.645 --> 01:23:01.897]  I wanna know, I wanna know why Fox News isn't more proud of the fact that they have a transsexual as their main host, Megyn Kelly.
[01:23:02.297 --> 01:23:04.800]  I guess there's a heckler or something going on, I didn't know.
[01:23:05.998 --> 01:23:07.199]  Tell the story.
[01:23:07.319 --> 01:23:08.920]  I love protests.
[01:23:09.181 --> 01:23:10.001]  I love protests.
[01:23:10.041 --> 01:23:10.842]  Let's hear this.
[01:23:10.922 --> 01:23:18.609]  Because here, this is a beautiful place, but we have thousands of people outside that weren't as good as real estate, in real estate as you folks, I will tell you.
[01:23:18.909 --> 01:23:21.211]  But we have thousands of people outside trying to get in.
[01:23:21.231 --> 01:23:24.334]  We set up cameras, we set up screens, we have everything.
[01:23:24.754 --> 01:23:29.398]  But I will tell you... I'll tell you, watching Fox last few days, he's destroyed, it's over, they're all freaked out.
[01:23:29.638 --> 01:23:31.940]  Because they're narcissists that need the populism.
[01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:34.061]  I mean, they're nobodies.
[01:23:34.081 --> 01:23:36.062]  Look, Trump just shows what straight talk does.
[01:23:36.222 --> 01:23:38.923]  I've always said to you, Kari, I'm not that good, I'm not that smart.
[01:23:39.023 --> 01:23:39.603]  Just be real.
[01:23:39.923 --> 01:23:40.423]  That's all they want.
[01:23:40.443 --> 01:23:41.444]  I mean, how many times have I said that?
[01:23:41.664 --> 01:23:44.945]  Yeah, you said just be yourself and just try to just lay it all out there.
[01:23:44.965 --> 01:23:45.885]  Yeah, and you have said that.
[01:23:45.985 --> 01:23:47.626]  And do I micromanage what you guys cover and do?
[01:23:48.607 --> 01:23:55.675]  I don't want to say I want to cover this or cover that, but I mean, I know you're patriots, I know you're smart, I looked at your work, and I just turned you loose.
[01:23:55.695 --> 01:23:56.255]  Do I not do that?
[01:23:56.376 --> 01:24:00.060]  Do you know how micromanaged it is to work even a local news station?
[01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:02.363]  Yeah, I've worked in local news.
[01:24:02.423 --> 01:24:04.505]  I know you have, and so have you in TV and entertainment.
[01:24:07.048 --> 01:24:08.330]  There's no teleprompter in here.
[01:24:23.166 --> 01:24:25.387]  And I always say, you know, I figured maybe they're fixed.
[01:24:25.427 --> 01:24:26.828]  These are new patterns they can't turn.
[01:24:27.228 --> 01:24:29.050]  Well, should we go to David and Joe out in Oregon?
[01:24:29.090 --> 01:24:30.670]  Because Donald Trump's on right now.
[01:24:30.691 --> 01:24:31.791]  But I understand that.
[01:24:31.831 --> 01:24:34.453]  Let's kind of leave him on in the background a little bit.
[01:24:34.493 --> 01:24:37.414]  We have a free feed of him at Infowars.com of it all happening.
[01:24:37.495 --> 01:24:42.437]  But let's go to a quick comment from David Knight and, of course, Joe Biggs.
[01:24:42.738 --> 01:24:46.620]  Hey Alex, David Knight here in Oregon with Joe Biggs.
[01:24:47.415 --> 01:24:49.856]  Am I the first one to use the term Reagan tonight?
[01:24:49.896 --> 01:24:55.279]  Because, you know, the last person who skipped a debate just before the Iowa caucus was Ronald Reagan.
[01:24:55.299 --> 01:24:58.640]  He went on to win it with a landslide, as many people pointed out.
[01:25:00.161 --> 01:25:00.641]  Absolutely.
[01:25:00.681 --> 01:25:02.262]  And just stay live on the feed with us, guys.
[01:25:02.322 --> 01:25:03.203]  Comment anytime you want.
[01:25:03.243 --> 01:25:04.023]  Jump in, Joe Biggs.
[01:25:05.784 --> 01:25:10.026]  Well, quite frankly, I think that Trump's little escapade is
[01:25:10.993 --> 01:25:11.434]  Not good.
[01:25:11.454 --> 01:25:13.355]  I think he's exploiting veterans.
[01:25:14.016 --> 01:25:15.878]  I quite frankly don't like what he's doing.
[01:25:17.139 --> 01:25:23.205]  I personally think Rand Paul is about the only choice out there for a true, honest person who knows what the hell's going on.
[01:25:24.206 --> 01:25:26.128]  He has a lot of neat things to say, Donald Trump.
[01:25:26.713 --> 01:25:39.786]  But I mean, saying, hey, veterans need help, or hey, we've got a problem with veterans, doesn't quite make me feel at ease as a veteran to think that you can take over the country and fix the problems that the other guys have already screwed up thus far.
[01:25:40.106 --> 01:25:48.915]  Well, Joe, I agree with you probably on 90% of stuff, but on this, I don't really disagree, but he's actually giving money that people are raising, and he's giving money
[01:25:50.355 --> 01:25:52.196]  Well, there's a lot of people out there that need help, veterans.
[01:25:52.236 --> 01:25:53.337]  Why don't you just give money to that?
[01:25:53.717 --> 01:26:00.800]  I mean, there's also a lot of veteran programs out there that have been known to skim money and do a lot of fraudulent stuff.
[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:04.701]  That's why I, personally, am very careful about who I do give money to.
[01:26:05.061 --> 01:26:12.124]  If I do want to help veterans out, I'm going to personally give to a group of veterans, not to a front who says they're doing it.
[01:26:12.204 --> 01:26:15.425]  Because nine times out of ten, that money's not going to make it to those guys.
[01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:19.290]  Here's what I'm saying about the situation.
[01:26:20.691 --> 01:26:27.072]  They're persecuting at the VA under Obama and the globalists, the veterans, who Obama declared the number one enemy.
[01:26:27.672 --> 01:26:31.473]  So all I'm saying is Obama says the number one enemy is returning veterans.
[01:26:31.753 --> 01:26:32.913]  They're trying to take their guns.
[01:26:33.253 --> 01:26:35.173]  And then Trump is at least saying put attention on it.
[01:26:35.513 --> 01:26:40.674]  I don't think he deserves to, you know, basically say he's exploiting veterans.
[01:26:41.535 --> 01:26:43.555]  Well, that's personally, I think.
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:44.981]  If he doesn't.
[01:26:45.001 --> 01:26:46.102]  Go ahead Joe, go ahead and make your point.
[01:26:46.122 --> 01:26:46.823]  Go ahead and make your point.
[01:26:47.043 --> 01:26:53.590]  I said I personally think he is, but also as well though too, he wants to, he doesn't want states to have to own the land.
[01:26:53.730 --> 01:26:55.412]  He wants that to be federally done.
[01:26:56.213 --> 01:26:59.337]  So this guy kind of goes against a lot of the things a lot of us believe in.
[01:26:59.857 --> 01:27:00.097]  Sure.
[01:27:00.338 --> 01:27:01.319]  He's inviting some people out.
[01:27:01.339 --> 01:27:02.580]  I want to see who these people are real quick.
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:03.541]  We'll come right back to you.
[01:27:03.561 --> 01:27:05.343]  It's fair points to make.
[01:27:06.747 --> 01:27:10.049]  Never had anything, it's like everything he touches turns to gold.
[01:27:10.109 --> 01:27:19.793]  Whatever deal he goes into, he bought a piece of land in Las Vegas, spent $110 million, he sold it a few years later and made plenty of money in between for $1.3 billion, right?
[01:27:19.933 --> 01:27:20.433]  Just about?
[01:27:20.873 --> 01:27:20.433]  $1.3.
[01:27:21.013 --> 01:27:22.534]  I think he says more.
[01:27:23.615 --> 01:27:24.635]  Every single day.
[01:27:24.655 --> 01:27:26.896]  So when he gives a million, it's like, you know what that says?
[01:27:26.976 --> 01:27:27.536]  Ten cents.
[01:27:27.616 --> 01:27:28.177]  But for him?
[01:27:28.637 --> 01:27:29.317]  Very important.
[01:27:29.837 --> 01:27:31.418]  Phil Ruffin, just say a couple of words.
[01:27:36.616 --> 01:27:37.036]  Thank you.
[01:27:38.558 --> 01:27:40.479]  I'd like to introduce my wife, Alexandra.
[01:27:40.499 --> 01:27:41.300]  I'm sure this guy's nice.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:43.381]  He looks like a James Bond.
[01:27:43.441 --> 01:27:44.102]  He's going all right.
[01:27:44.122 --> 01:27:46.123]  Donald and I have been friends for some 18 years.
[01:27:46.164 --> 01:27:47.384]  We've been business partners.
[01:27:49.923 --> 01:27:53.605]  We're going to go back to our guys and back to the Fox thing for a minute.
[01:27:53.645 --> 01:27:56.187]  But people are going to love this just because it's real compared to other stuff.
[01:27:56.447 --> 01:27:59.809]  But Biggs, seriously, I'm not trying to get in an argument or fight with you.
[01:28:00.450 --> 01:28:06.113]  Compared to Obama and the neocons trying to start all these wars, Trump doesn't want us in Syria.
[01:28:08.074 --> 01:28:08.995]  Just compared to them.
[01:28:09.275 --> 01:28:11.516]  I think Rand Paul is better on foreign policy than Trump.
[01:28:12.016 --> 01:28:17.619]  I mean, I agree with you there, but I mean, I just, I mean, just hearing like Trump and this whole thing, veterans, blah, blah, blah.
[01:28:17.979 --> 01:28:22.682]  I mean, he already told Fox and CNN, yeah, I'll come to your debates if you give money to the veterans.
[01:28:22.942 --> 01:28:25.263]  So I really think what he's doing is legitimate overall.
[01:28:26.926 --> 01:28:29.588]  I mean, I think he's got money that he can actually do something.
[01:28:29.628 --> 01:28:31.629]  Go out and actually give veterans things.
[01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:32.310]  Go to a VA.
[01:28:32.330 --> 01:28:35.712]  Go to a hospital where there's people out there in wheelchairs who aren't being seen.
[01:28:35.732 --> 01:28:36.192]  He should do that.
[01:28:36.272 --> 01:28:36.932]  He should actually.
[01:28:36.952 --> 01:28:37.933]  That's a great idea for Trump.
[01:28:37.953 --> 01:28:38.914]  I'm going to tell his campaign.
[01:28:38.934 --> 01:28:39.414]  He should go.
[01:28:39.434 --> 01:28:40.855]  How about this, though?
[01:28:40.915 --> 01:28:46.659]  I mean, in comparison to Rand Paul and Trump, Rand Paul, I think, wins all around.
[01:28:47.499 --> 01:28:48.580]  Honestly, I mean, obviously,
[01:28:49.594 --> 01:28:54.776]  You know, Donald Trump's going to win the popularity vote because he's a, you know, reality TV show guy.
[01:28:54.796 --> 01:28:59.497]  He's got some hotels, you know, and that's an appealing thing because he goes against the grain.
[01:28:59.817 --> 01:29:02.518]  And I like the fact that he says stuff that pisses people off every day.
[01:29:02.878 --> 01:29:03.819]  I love that about him.
[01:29:04.139 --> 01:29:08.360]  But there's still some issues there with him that quite make me, I just, I'm not convinced.
[01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:09.240]  I'm going to ask you this.
[01:29:09.321 --> 01:29:13.642]  Is he, is he, is he better than Hillary or, or, or Jeb Bush?
[01:29:14.571 --> 01:29:15.111]  Oh, of course.
[01:29:15.171 --> 01:29:19.014]  I mean, so is Dan Bilzerian and, like, some homeless guy that I just saw on the sidewalk.
[01:29:19.254 --> 01:29:23.517]  Okay, Dan Bilzerian for, you know, I've never looked at any of the girls with bikinis there on Facebook.
[01:29:23.858 --> 01:29:25.619]  Okay, alright, we're going to go back to you in a minute.
[01:29:25.819 --> 01:29:29.001]  I want to go back to Trump here, and we're going to all be chiming in over this.
[01:29:29.041 --> 01:29:29.922]  Let's go back to what Trump's...
[01:29:30.302 --> 01:29:32.585]  I don't feel good about turning down money.
[01:29:33.205 --> 01:29:35.949]  Because my whole life I've been greedy, greedy, greedy.
[01:29:36.009 --> 01:29:37.610]  I've grabbed all the money I could get.
[01:29:37.650 --> 01:29:38.391]  I'm so greedy.
[01:29:38.411 --> 01:29:39.172]  Greedy, greedy, greedy.
[01:29:39.192 --> 01:29:41.054]  I want to be greedy for the United States.
[01:29:41.074 --> 01:29:41.935]  That's going to be a meme.
[01:29:41.955 --> 01:29:45.059]  We've got to have a president that's greedy, greedy, greedy.
[01:29:45.319 --> 01:29:46.821]  I do respect the man's honesty.
[01:29:46.841 --> 01:29:49.424]  If I don't agree with everything he says I expect he just...
[01:29:49.704 --> 01:29:53.445]  Can someone please turn that into a GIF right now?
[01:29:53.465 --> 01:29:57.786]  The most incredible people in this country, in Iowa, but in this country.
[01:29:57.806 --> 01:29:58.947]  It's like a movement going on.
[01:29:58.967 --> 01:30:02.288]  The cover of Time Magazine this week is a whole thing.
[01:30:02.348 --> 01:30:03.228]  It's a cover story.
[01:30:03.268 --> 01:30:05.228]  In fact, they have, there it is, hold that up.
[01:30:05.569 --> 01:30:06.949]  They have the back of my head.
[01:30:08.186 --> 01:30:12.948]  They have the back of my head with a massive crowd in front of me, and they're covering the story.
[01:30:13.569 --> 01:30:16.951]  And I said, I didn't even know they were doing the story, and it's the cover of Time.
[01:30:17.211 --> 01:30:18.411]  They're talking about the movement.
[01:30:18.511 --> 01:30:19.712]  It is actually a movement.
[01:30:20.132 --> 01:30:25.275]  But what's happened... Now that's actually what Bilder Bergman said about, is that he's creating a populist movement.
[01:30:26.056 --> 01:30:28.798]  I want to go back to David Knight and his take on this.
[01:30:28.918 --> 01:30:32.601]  Regardless, he's firing up populism ten times Ross Perot.
[01:30:32.981 --> 01:30:34.323]  That's frightening Bilderberg.
[01:30:34.563 --> 01:30:38.006]  The big money Democrat and Republican is going out against him.
[01:30:38.046 --> 01:30:45.012]  That's why I, months ago, had to say, I've got to start at least supporting Trump because he's a figurehead of a populist movement.
[01:30:45.072 --> 01:30:46.113]  If he betrays us,
[01:30:46.693 --> 01:30:54.038]  It'll be over the top, but at the same time, the Liberty Movement needs to get in on this because, you know, we know the Republican establishment's bad.
[01:30:54.078 --> 01:30:55.940]  Look, I'm a smart political analyst.
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:58.542]  The Bundys didn't listen to me, look where they are now.
[01:30:59.222 --> 01:31:03.405]  And so, I'm not trying to sell my own crew completely on this, because I wasn't completely sold.
[01:31:04.266 --> 01:31:06.447]  It's just, I mean, look, I was invited to meet Bush.
[01:31:06.768 --> 01:31:07.788]  I didn't go sell out to him.
[01:31:07.989 --> 01:31:10.951]  I was invited to meet Clinton when I was on two radio stations.
[01:31:11.331 --> 01:31:13.553]  I've never really said all this before, but I'm saying it now.
[01:31:13.954 --> 01:31:15.875]  I mean, I've already been invited by the big guys.
[01:31:15.935 --> 01:31:16.816]  I didn't go meet with them.
[01:31:17.417 --> 01:31:22.902]  I've done this with Trump because my gut tells me that there's a chance that we can make him ours.
[01:31:23.302 --> 01:31:24.443]  And I don't think he's evil.
[01:31:24.844 --> 01:31:28.407]  I think he's a big, powerful guy that wants to be George Washington 2.0.
[01:31:28.727 --> 01:31:30.889]  I don't think he knows exactly who George Washington is.
[01:31:31.170 --> 01:31:33.352]  I said, you know, isn't George Washington the greatest person ever?
[01:31:33.372 --> 01:31:34.713]  And he goes, well, that's what they say.
[01:31:34.753 --> 01:31:35.314]  Let's move on.
[01:31:35.734 --> 01:31:37.495]  You know, because I, you know, whatever.
[01:31:37.555 --> 01:31:39.876]  The point is, is that that's my view.
[01:31:40.236 --> 01:31:41.757]  So he's the best shot we've got.
[01:31:41.777 --> 01:31:45.538]  I like Rand Paul too, but I can't be the purest up here.
[01:31:47.639 --> 01:31:49.380]  You know, because he doesn't have a chance in hell.
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:52.981]  He's too busy talking crap about Trump, which he ought to know is a populist movement.
[01:31:53.201 --> 01:31:57.143]  And he's like tying bowling balls to his political legs and jumping in a hundred foot swimming pool.
[01:31:57.583 --> 01:32:01.086]  But is the enemy of our enemy really our friend when we look at Donald Trump?
[01:32:01.186 --> 01:32:03.488]  Because I do agree with you, the power elite hate the guy.
[01:32:03.528 --> 01:32:04.849]  And I definitely recognize that.
[01:32:05.469 --> 01:32:11.054]  I don't think he's a puppet by any means, but once he gets in office, is he really going to fight for the right?
[01:32:11.074 --> 01:32:13.836]  If he screws us over once he's in office, I'll go after him.
[01:32:13.896 --> 01:32:14.937]  I don't think that's going to happen.
[01:32:14.957 --> 01:32:17.559]  And I think if they blow his plane up or something, everybody's going to be eating crow.
[01:32:17.959 --> 01:32:18.219]  Yeah.
[01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:20.621]  Let me tell you, I think he's for real.
[01:32:21.182 --> 01:32:21.802]  I'm pretty sure.
[01:32:21.822 --> 01:32:24.785]  He may be for real trying to take over from the New World Order for himself.
[01:32:25.854 --> 01:32:27.855]  All I know is he's got them crapping their pants, Sha'Carri.
[01:32:28.035 --> 01:32:28.935]  Let's go to David Knight.
[01:32:29.376 --> 01:32:30.476]  I'm betting on Trump, folks.
[01:32:31.036 --> 01:32:31.356]  Alright?
[01:32:31.837 --> 01:32:32.997]  Ace of spades is Trump.
[01:32:33.057 --> 01:32:33.997]  Royal flush right there.
[01:32:34.398 --> 01:32:34.978]  Pun intended.
[01:32:34.998 --> 01:32:38.339]  Let's go ahead and go and see what David Knight has to say.
[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:45.602]  Well, you know, Alex, in terms of what you're talking about, I gotta say, you know, I look at different aspects of my personality.
[01:32:45.642 --> 01:32:48.744]  The anarchist in me likes Trump.
[01:32:49.064 --> 01:32:53.326]  Because I just want to say, let's just burn this thing down and give the system the finger, right?
[01:32:54.386 --> 01:32:55.866]  There certainly is an aspect of that.
[01:32:56.026 --> 01:32:58.727]  There's also the nationalism, the populism.
[01:32:58.767 --> 01:33:03.588]  Remember Ross Perot when he was running and he was running against NAFTA and he was talking about that?
[01:33:03.948 --> 01:33:19.312]  Now we have a situation where you've got another outsider who is on the scene at the time that they're trying to do the next level of economic consolidation which will eventually become a sovereignty grabbing consolidations we've seen with the European Union.
[01:33:20.052 --> 01:33:22.493]  So that is something that I think really concerns
[01:33:22.973 --> 01:33:28.137]  The elites at Davos, they're talking about how the specter of Donald Trump was haunting them there.
[01:33:28.597 --> 01:33:30.919]  So, yeah, I don't think that he's on board with them.
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:33.521]  He may share some common goals with them.
[01:33:33.541 --> 01:33:38.604]  They may think that they might be able to get him to do what they want if they can make a deal with him.
[01:33:38.725 --> 01:33:40.206]  I mean, certainly he's up for deals.
[01:33:40.306 --> 01:33:41.747]  Oh, look, he just brought up Huckabee.
[01:33:42.267 --> 01:33:44.048]  The word is Huckabee may endorse him very soon.
[01:33:44.068 --> 01:33:45.469]  He'll be part of this event tonight.
[01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:46.390]  I hear you.
[01:33:46.410 --> 01:33:47.831]  We just know Hillary's bad.
[01:33:48.091 --> 01:33:48.952]  We know the others are bad.
[01:33:49.032 --> 01:33:51.634]  I'm not even saying fix everything at the federal level.
[01:33:51.934 --> 01:33:55.215]  Well, I think Huckabee and Santorum are both at that event right now offstage.
[01:33:55.255 --> 01:33:56.716]  Yeah, they both just stood up there.
[01:33:56.736 --> 01:34:00.558]  Yeah, they're there and that's... Oh no, we had Stone on at 2 o'clock.
[01:34:00.818 --> 01:34:01.538]  Well, that's important.
[01:34:01.618 --> 01:34:03.439]  And he just talked to Trump and said they're going to be there, yeah.
[01:34:03.479 --> 01:34:07.401]  Well, that's important because a lot of the evangelicals are going for Huckabee.
[01:34:07.421 --> 01:34:08.361]  They're bringing Huckabee up.
[01:34:08.381 --> 01:34:09.522]  Let's put him on.
[01:34:09.582 --> 01:34:10.262]  Let's put Huckabee on.
[01:34:10.302 --> 01:34:11.122]  We'll come right back to you.
[01:34:15.624 --> 01:34:16.605]  And Mrs. Huckabee?
[01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:18.810]  And Rick's daughter?
[01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:20.051]  I don't like Santorum.
[01:34:20.991 --> 01:34:22.311]  But Iowa does.
[01:34:22.411 --> 01:34:24.272]  Both of these guys won in Iowa before.
[01:34:24.292 --> 01:34:25.712]  No, you're absolutely right.
[01:34:25.732 --> 01:34:26.652]  Yeah, they both won in Iowa.
[01:34:26.852 --> 01:34:32.614]  And the evangelicals like Huckabee, which they're also kind of swinging for Cruz as well.
[01:34:32.634 --> 01:34:36.015]  So these two people do know that they would never, ever have done a thing like that.
[01:34:36.095 --> 01:34:40.076]  But when you see deals that are so bad, believe me, they're not bad for the politician.
[01:34:40.296 --> 01:34:43.617]  They're bad for the country, and that's why I don't take anything.
[01:34:43.897 --> 01:34:44.877]  I don't take anything.
[01:34:44.917 --> 01:34:46.278]  That's where Trump's going the right way now.
[01:34:46.818 --> 01:34:47.539]  He's saying this.
[01:34:47.579 --> 01:34:49.219]  Now they're not dumb, they're robbing you.
[01:34:49.279 --> 01:34:49.560]  Whoa.
[01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:50.260]  That was new.
[01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:54.182]  And I actually sent the message to Trump, stop saying they were dumb.
[01:34:55.462 --> 01:34:56.242]  And who the hell knows?
[01:34:56.303 --> 01:34:57.863]  I think they're making bad deals because they're dumb.
[01:34:57.903 --> 01:34:58.584]  No, they're screwing us.
[01:34:58.604 --> 01:34:59.404]  How did they do it?
[01:34:59.864 --> 01:35:01.905]  I think if you did poorly, you probably wouldn't be here right now.
[01:35:01.945 --> 01:35:03.346]  You'd go back, you'd be depressed, right?
[01:35:03.526 --> 01:35:04.726]  You guys know Trump listens to the show.
[01:35:04.746 --> 01:35:05.186]  That's not bull.
[01:35:05.206 --> 01:35:06.187]  Say a few words, Mike.
[01:35:06.207 --> 01:35:06.647]  Leave it alone.
[01:35:06.667 --> 01:35:07.367]  Thank you so much.
[01:35:07.387 --> 01:35:10.769]  It's kind of hard to listen to a show and not start waving at him.
[01:35:13.351 --> 01:35:14.011]  Look at this.
[01:35:14.131 --> 01:35:15.072]  Look at this spectacle.
[01:35:15.112 --> 01:35:16.793]  They've taken over the media.
[01:35:16.833 --> 01:35:17.973]  They've taken over the media.
[01:35:18.413 --> 01:35:19.634]  We have our own feed there as well.
[01:35:19.654 --> 01:35:20.874]  We're carrying C-SPAN.
[01:35:20.914 --> 01:35:21.935]  Look at this spectacle.
[01:35:22.175 --> 01:35:23.236]  We're taking over the media.
[01:35:23.276 --> 01:35:25.056]  I'm supporting another candidate for president.
[01:35:25.276 --> 01:35:27.978]  Well yeah, we're leading that, but more folks are going to get involved.
[01:35:28.018 --> 01:35:31.219]  I want folks to get so successful at this that we become obsolete.
[01:35:31.399 --> 01:35:35.161]  I'm a pundit, you're a pundit, we have an operation, but it's not like up to us to do everything.
[01:35:35.181 --> 01:35:36.361]  We work 8 hours and go home.
[01:35:36.562 --> 01:35:37.362]  We don't work 14 hours.
[01:35:38.448 --> 01:35:39.329]  I want to win, folks.
[01:35:39.349 --> 01:35:40.709]  I want to take my kids fishing.
[01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:41.970]  Yeah!
[01:35:42.230 --> 01:35:44.071]  Yeah, win!
[01:35:44.091 --> 01:35:46.873]  Now, bitch, endorse Trump immediately!
[01:35:47.573 --> 01:35:49.995]  I want to endorse Trump.
[01:35:50.095 --> 01:35:50.795]  That's a joke.
[01:35:50.935 --> 01:35:51.576]  It's a joke.
[01:35:51.716 --> 01:35:53.377]  It'll be in the news tomorrow.
[01:35:53.717 --> 01:35:57.339]  Jones orders reporters to endorse Trump.
[01:35:57.379 --> 01:35:58.220]  And drink Kool-Aid.
[01:35:58.340 --> 01:36:01.942]  To make sure our veterans have the best possible health care in the world.
[01:36:02.202 --> 01:36:03.582]  Yeah, I don't want to hear from Santorum.
[01:36:03.622 --> 01:36:05.283]  Let's give me a break.
[01:36:05.303 --> 01:36:07.083]  But he did win Iowa, you're right, Lee, and that's why they're there.
[01:36:07.163 --> 01:36:09.204]  That's why Stone got them to be there.
[01:36:09.544 --> 01:36:15.086]  And it shows the people who are torn between Cruz and these others that these guys are going for Trump.
[01:36:15.726 --> 01:36:23.428]  The Guardian, the Washington Post, hundreds, thousands covered it, but hundreds said, why is this shadow campaign manager hanging out with Alex Jones?
[01:36:23.628 --> 01:36:24.849]  What is Trump doing?
[01:36:25.429 --> 01:36:26.609]  Now Bilderberg's like, oh no!
[01:36:27.069 --> 01:36:28.430]  I mean, believe me, guys.
[01:36:29.230 --> 01:36:35.835]  Oh my gosh, what if they get us into Bilderberg next time around and we just roll in and... I don't want to be part of that.
[01:36:36.015 --> 01:36:36.676]  I'm just saying.
[01:36:36.696 --> 01:36:37.537]  No, I know, I know, it'll be fun.
[01:36:37.557 --> 01:36:38.537]  We'll parachute you in.
[01:36:38.657 --> 01:36:40.099]  Ooh, we can get the secret documents.
[01:36:40.299 --> 01:36:41.600]  That's right, let's go to Kit Daniels.
[01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:46.644]  Kit Daniels, my friend, InfoWars.com reporter, what do you make of this spectacle?
[01:36:46.804 --> 01:36:47.965]  Yeah, I wanted to point something out.
[01:36:48.005 --> 01:36:51.447]  This is something I've been talking with a lot of guys here in the office, Thalen, who
[01:36:52.288 --> 01:36:56.189]  That's it, that's why the elite are scared!
[01:37:17.237 --> 01:37:18.678]  That's what everybody's basically saying here.
[01:37:18.738 --> 01:37:20.219]  I mean, that's what I finally got.
[01:37:20.239 --> 01:37:22.241]  It's like, no, they're really... Oh, here's Huckabee.
[01:37:22.261 --> 01:37:22.861]  Let's go to Huckabee.
[01:37:23.041 --> 01:37:24.082]  We'll go back to Kit Daniels.
[01:37:24.102 --> 01:37:25.303]  You're gonna get the photo anyway.
[01:37:25.343 --> 01:37:27.264]  I might as well just stand here and be done with it.
[01:37:28.425 --> 01:37:29.825]  Oh, right in front of the Trump sign.
[01:37:30.706 --> 01:37:31.947]  Look, let me be very clear.
[01:37:33.436 --> 01:37:50.692]  Rick Santorum, Donald Trump and I may be competitors in a presidential race, but tonight we are colleagues in unison standing here for the people who let us breathe every breath of free air we breathe, the veterans of the United States of America.
[01:37:51.153 --> 01:37:53.335]  Without you, there is no government.
[01:38:08.308 --> 01:38:09.448]  I don't like that particular chant.
[01:38:09.468 --> 01:38:12.049]  That's what you usually hear when they blow up some innocent country.
[01:38:12.349 --> 01:38:12.609]  Right.
[01:38:13.069 --> 01:38:14.289]  We heard that with Obama, too.
[01:38:14.449 --> 01:38:19.630]  You see, in my mind, I was hearing you say, go, Huck, go, but... It's not like it's a USA chant.
[01:38:19.690 --> 01:38:24.892]  It's like, you know, for something good, like winning at the Olympics, but they just use it to, like... It's been overused.
[01:38:24.972 --> 01:38:26.692]  It's been overused, yeah.
[01:38:26.712 --> 01:38:28.972]  People that are killing Americans in the U.S., but they're trying to take it back.
[01:38:29.012 --> 01:38:29.873]  I get that.
[01:38:29.913 --> 01:38:31.113]  And he's not that kind of person.
[01:38:31.773 --> 01:38:39.881]  And I want to say thank you, Donald Trump, for asking Rick Santorum... I'm not sitting by letting her get in.
[01:38:40.001 --> 01:38:42.924]  It looks like Hillary's got a circle in the toilet bowl.
[01:38:42.984 --> 01:38:44.866]  Oh yeah, they may indict her, and we've been pushing for that.
[01:38:45.266 --> 01:38:51.552]  But don't think that... And the FBI says they're not backing down, so she could be facing that indictment, her or her top aides.
[01:38:51.572 --> 01:38:55.496]  Well, I'm not going to believe it until I hear that toilet slurp noise.
[01:38:56.417 --> 01:38:59.219]  But then she'll still come out of it like an eel or something.
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:01.722]  Well, it's like they're trying to push up Bernie.
[01:39:01.742 --> 01:39:03.603]  He's hanging out with Obama now from what I understand.
[01:39:03.863 --> 01:39:04.224]  Absolutely.
[01:39:04.244 --> 01:39:04.804]  Let's go back.
[01:39:04.884 --> 01:39:05.144]  Oh, yeah.
[01:39:05.164 --> 01:39:09.028]  The people who stood between bullets, bombs, and our freedom.
[01:39:09.188 --> 01:39:10.869]  Oh, hey, we're not watching Fox, are we?
[01:39:11.209 --> 01:39:12.290]  I just realized that.
[01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:13.672]  Is that my decision?
[01:39:13.692 --> 01:39:13.952]  Yours?
[01:39:13.992 --> 01:39:15.213]  Do we want to go to Fox?
[01:39:15.953 --> 01:39:17.455]  Let's briefly go to Fox for a moment.
[01:39:18.035 --> 01:39:19.576]  I want to do one simple thing tonight.
[01:39:19.676 --> 01:39:20.016]  I'm done.
[01:39:20.056 --> 01:39:20.676]  I'll turn it back on.
[01:39:20.716 --> 01:39:21.616]  Oh, let's hear this first.
[01:39:21.656 --> 01:39:22.237]  I'm sorry.
[01:39:22.337 --> 01:39:23.497]  I can't turn it on right now.
[01:39:23.577 --> 01:39:34.321]  In September 2005, a very good friend of mine who teaches school at the Joe T. Robinson High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, did something pretty extraordinary on the first day of school.
[01:39:34.341 --> 01:39:35.681]  She got permission of the principal.
[01:39:36.242 --> 01:39:39.583]  She had all the desks from her classroom removed.
[01:39:41.167 --> 01:39:42.188]  Every desk taken out.
[01:39:42.648 --> 01:39:44.148]  The kids came in for first period.
[01:39:44.309 --> 01:39:45.069]  Oh, Garfi, what's Garfi?
[01:39:45.089 --> 01:39:45.889]  And they said, Ms.
[01:39:45.929 --> 01:39:47.710]  Cothran, her name is Martha Cothran.
[01:39:47.730 --> 01:39:48.150]  Garfi, too.
[01:39:48.851 --> 01:39:51.472]  Her dad was a World War II POW.
[01:39:52.833 --> 01:39:54.073]  So she takes all the desks out.
[01:39:54.093 --> 01:39:55.514]  When they come in, they say, where's our desk?
[01:39:55.534 --> 01:39:59.676]  She says, you don't get a desk in my class until you can tell me how you earn it.
[01:40:00.694 --> 01:40:02.855]  Well, the kid said, well, I guess we get good grades.
[01:40:03.156 --> 01:40:04.596]  She said, no, that's important.
[01:40:04.977 --> 01:40:07.098]  You need to do that, but that's not going to get you a desk.
[01:40:07.898 --> 01:40:10.260]  Another kid said, well, we have to behave.
[01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:12.361]  She said, oh, you will behave in my class.
[01:40:13.282 --> 01:40:14.523]  But that won't get you a desk.
[01:40:14.903 --> 01:40:16.003]  And none of them could figure it out.
[01:40:16.904 --> 01:40:17.805]  Second period came.
[01:40:17.885 --> 01:40:18.385]  Same thing.
[01:40:18.425 --> 01:40:20.987]  You don't get a desk until you tell me how you earn it.
[01:40:22.467 --> 01:40:23.088]  Third period.
[01:40:23.148 --> 01:40:23.588]  Fourth period.
[01:40:23.608 --> 01:40:28.491]  By now, kids are calling their parents on cell phones and saying, Mrs. Cothran has lost her mind.
[01:40:28.551 --> 01:40:29.552]  She won't let us have a desk.
[01:40:31.212 --> 01:40:42.001]  News organizations from Little Rock started coming out to Joe T. Robinson High School in the early afternoon to figure out what has happened with his teacher who has snapped because she's taken all the desks out of her classroom.
[01:40:43.842 --> 01:40:48.766]  Last period of the day, the kids came in, asked the same question, where are our desks?
[01:40:49.827 --> 01:40:53.330]  And she said, you have to tell me how you earn it.
[01:40:54.511 --> 01:40:55.012]  None of them did.
[01:40:56.092 --> 01:40:57.915]  She said, I guess I'm gonna have to explain it to her.
[01:40:57.935 --> 01:40:58.596]  Yes, tell us!
[01:40:59.217 --> 01:41:01.561]  Martha Cothran walked over to the door of her classroom.
[01:41:01.802 --> 01:41:02.483]  Giant chipmunk.
[01:41:02.503 --> 01:41:03.184]  She opened the door.
[01:41:05.108 --> 01:41:05.188]  And 27
[01:41:07.432 --> 01:41:07.712]  U.S.
[01:41:07.752 --> 01:41:14.035]  veterans, wearing their uniforms from various wars, walked in carrying a desk.
[01:41:15.016 --> 01:41:30.503]  They brought those desks in and lined them up in rows, and as they did, Martha Cothran said, on a day that I'm sure will never be forgotten by those students, she said, kids, you don't have to earn your desk, because these guys
[01:41:31.423 --> 01:41:32.504]  They already did.
[01:41:32.524 --> 01:41:34.707]  That's why you have a school desk.
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:51.864]  So there is this cult of the military thing that I get is being sickeningly used for politics.
[01:41:51.884 --> 01:41:53.506]  And I'm kind of starting to get what Biggs is saying.
[01:41:53.906 --> 01:41:55.127]  That type of behavior.
[01:41:55.147 --> 01:41:56.048]  I'm not against Huckabee.
[01:41:56.128 --> 01:41:58.150]  I'm not against supporting our military.
[01:41:58.350 --> 01:42:02.433]  But the more we hear all that military worship, the more the troops are put on don't treat death list.
[01:42:02.794 --> 01:42:05.076]  And we're going to go back to Biggs in a minute, back to everybody else.
[01:42:05.236 --> 01:42:06.357]  Let's go back to Trump right now.
[01:42:06.717 --> 01:42:09.700]  Because Jeb Bush is on this screen and I'm not putting him on.
[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:11.761]  I'm very happy with what's going on.
[01:42:11.902 --> 01:42:14.444]  Run down to your Nazi hoard in South America.
[01:42:14.964 --> 01:42:16.526]  And I'm not going to be doing polls tonight.
[01:42:16.586 --> 01:42:18.147]  Usually, I like to get up and do polls.
[01:42:18.207 --> 01:42:21.090]  And everybody, even Mike, would say, why do you keep doing those polls?
[01:42:21.130 --> 01:42:22.431]  I say, because they're so good.
[01:42:22.672 --> 01:42:26.876]  You know, when you... But we have had, we've had amazing polls in Iowa.
[01:42:26.896 --> 01:42:28.838]  We've had amazing polls no matter where we've been.
[01:42:28.858 --> 01:42:33.923]  David makes a great point, but I forgot, it was Reagan that switched, that skipped the last debate before Iowa.
[01:42:34.343 --> 01:42:37.266]  We're leading every national... It's fun having you researchers in there, you know?
[01:42:39.713 --> 01:42:50.943]  I wanna go back to David Knight real quick, and then have Leanne Jacari comment, and then go back to Kit, but, uh... ...of seeing what's going on with our country, how incompetently we're run, how our military is being decimated... No, it's done on purpose.
[01:42:51.423 --> 01:42:56.968]  Let's go back... ...as an example, what's happening tonight... It is true that 1% of our funding is for the infantry that does almost all the work.
[01:42:57.248 --> 01:42:58.089]  Think about that.
[01:42:58.149 --> 01:43:00.811]  It's all these fighters that are pieces of crap.
[01:43:01.211 --> 01:43:01.832]  It's all scams.
[01:43:01.852 --> 01:43:05.555]  ...industrial complex... Yeah, which is globalist, is actually undermining us on purpose.
[01:43:05.635 --> 01:43:09.560]  Right, but they ramp up the military and tell us, tell everyone we have to support the military.
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:10.001]  Yeah.
[01:43:10.321 --> 01:43:16.790]  Because we know the men and women in uniform, but that's not... They use them to get the support for the million dollar airplanes that don't work.
[01:43:16.830 --> 01:43:17.891]  And we have perpetual wars.
[01:43:18.011 --> 01:43:21.276]  Oh yeah, those big aircraft carriers that break down after 10 miles.
[01:43:21.536 --> 01:43:21.736]  Right.
[01:43:21.916 --> 01:43:22.276]  Exactly.
[01:43:22.316 --> 01:43:28.320]  Let's go to David Knight and Joe Biggs who are again in Washington covering the ongoing money standoff.
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:33.203]  Were there any new developments by the way guys before we get into Trump today?
[01:43:33.223 --> 01:43:35.424]  I know they were the last five that were going to come out.
[01:43:35.804 --> 01:43:39.406]  Obviously we have LaVoie killed a day and a half ago.
[01:43:39.486 --> 01:43:40.967]  Any new developments while you're there covering this?
[01:43:41.887 --> 01:43:46.630]  Yeah Alex, the FBI released aerial footage of LaVoie.
[01:43:48.642 --> 01:43:49.684]  It doesn't really match.
[01:44:06.024 --> 01:44:11.005]  Yeah, it's like going back to the whole Oregon standoff and then tying it into the Trump debate.
[01:44:11.105 --> 01:44:16.047]  I mean, if you're a leftist, you know, yeah, they're going to try to two together.
[01:44:16.527 --> 01:44:21.648]  But realistically speaking, they're both kind of showing this whole populist movement going on.
[01:44:21.989 --> 01:44:25.029]  And I'm not saying I agree with what the militia is doing, the four guys.
[01:44:25.049 --> 01:44:26.410]  It's a manifestation of it.
[01:44:26.530 --> 01:44:26.730]  Yeah.
[01:44:27.170 --> 01:44:39.800]  Yeah, we're seeing all these different levels of manifestation going on with populism and this kind of this open rebellion and resistance to infringements on the Constitution and freedoms in general.
[01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:41.921]  And we're seeing this more and more.
[01:44:41.941 --> 01:44:44.103]  It's not just the Trump campaign.
[01:44:44.503 --> 01:44:51.849]  The Trump campaign is just kind of a window, a lens if you will, into what's really going on, what people are really thinking.
[01:44:52.289 --> 01:44:54.011]  Trump is just a manifestation of what
[01:44:54.551 --> 01:44:57.392]  Millions of Americans subconsciously are already sane.
[01:44:58.273 --> 01:44:58.913]  I agree with that.
[01:44:58.933 --> 01:45:00.774]  And let's get Jakari's take and then Leanne's on that.
[01:45:00.794 --> 01:45:04.056]  And then I want to go to Darren McBreen and get some of the Twitter and Facebook comments.
[01:45:04.076 --> 01:45:05.176]  You know, our Twitter's popular.
[01:45:05.456 --> 01:45:06.217]  We came to it late.
[01:45:06.237 --> 01:45:07.617]  It's only got like 300-something thousand.
[01:45:08.097 --> 01:45:10.038]  But our Facebooks have over 3 million.
[01:45:10.078 --> 01:45:11.419]  Our one big, one over a million.
[01:45:12.219 --> 01:45:15.001]  And, you know, that's where a lot of the really important comments are as well.
[01:45:15.021 --> 01:45:18.903]  A lot of the key articles and videos and news tips we get are from Facebook.
[01:45:18.923 --> 01:45:21.584]  We get as many visits now on Facebook as we do to InfoWars.
[01:45:21.624 --> 01:45:23.045]  Millions, millions a day.
[01:45:24.085 --> 01:45:35.989]  I am getting, this is at a Veterans Center, the money's for veterans, but we are 30 minutes into this and all he's doing is talking about veterans, which I guess he's going for the veteran vote, that's fine.
[01:45:36.509 --> 01:45:39.970]  I would like to hear him get into the private run for private Federal Reserve.
[01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:42.371]  I would like him to get into Hillary being indicted.
[01:45:42.691 --> 01:45:45.612]  I mean, you know, because I think, you know, score some bigger political points here.
[01:45:45.872 --> 01:45:48.693]  But I get the main mission is actually bring attention to veterans.
[01:45:49.373 --> 01:45:55.275]  But real quick, let's see who this fellow is who's on screen right now from at Drake University.
[01:45:55.915 --> 01:45:56.575]  Who is this fellow?
[01:45:56.715 --> 01:45:59.876]  But no, I want to thank all of y'all for coming out and Trump's here.
[01:46:00.217 --> 01:46:01.417]  I'm not here for politics.
[01:46:01.477 --> 01:46:03.258]  I want to make that absolutely clear.
[01:46:03.678 --> 01:46:04.378]  I'm here for people.
[01:46:05.459 --> 01:46:07.300]  I don't care about Republican or Democrat.
[01:46:07.340 --> 01:46:08.260]  I care about America.
[01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:10.360]  And I've known Donald Trump Jr.
[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:11.121]  for a while now.
[01:46:11.521 --> 01:46:14.502]  He's never asked me for one thing politically.
[01:46:14.762 --> 01:46:22.484]  But what I know he has done is see me at his hotel, Trump International Las Vegas, when I was at a conference in Vegas for SHOT Show.
[01:46:22.504 --> 01:46:25.285]  I have a little gun company and... That was just last week.
[01:46:25.345 --> 01:46:26.225]  And Joe Big's there.
[01:46:27.065 --> 01:46:30.846]  Being Mr. Trump, he was eating with Willie Robinson, Doug Donnie's the guy.
[01:46:30.886 --> 01:46:35.268]  Real cool guy, introduced myself, said thank you for letting us have, you know, for coming and everything.
[01:46:35.368 --> 01:46:37.088]  And, uh, Mr. Trump left.
[01:46:37.628 --> 01:46:43.030]  Well, he came back and he squatted next to my table and talked to me for almost an hour and didn't ask one thing.
[01:46:43.070 --> 01:46:50.412]  He just genuinely wanted to say hi and let me know that he cared about my service and that, you know, he wanted me to make sure I had a good time.
[01:46:50.692 --> 01:46:51.573]  So I'm here for people.
[01:46:51.913 --> 01:46:54.834]  I'm here for people as great as he is and the Trump organization.
[01:46:55.794 --> 01:46:58.795]  I can't quite make out from where we are the feet of this guy.
[01:46:58.815 --> 01:47:00.316]  You didn't see him at SHOT Show?
[01:47:00.336 --> 01:47:03.137]  No, but I did see Trump and his sons and I saw Rick Perry and
[01:47:23.105 --> 01:47:25.907]  By the way, Megs was on vacation at SHOT Show.
[01:47:27.228 --> 01:47:29.409]  I did see a whole lot of people up there.
[01:47:29.429 --> 01:47:32.711]  Rick Perry was trying to be all incognito when he passed me though.
[01:47:32.751 --> 01:47:35.973]  I said, what's up Rick?
[01:47:36.734 --> 01:47:38.255]  He can't hide with those glasses.
[01:47:39.656 --> 01:47:42.777]  Yeah, I can't make the guy out.
[01:47:42.837 --> 01:47:47.580]  It's too hard to tell from... It's Sergeant John Wayne Walding.
[01:47:48.001 --> 01:47:49.642]  John Wayne Walding, retired U.S.
[01:47:49.722 --> 01:47:49.882]  Army.
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:54.124]  But what we can tell you is an update from Oregon is there were five people there.
[01:47:54.244 --> 01:47:56.867]  One guy was told that if he left he would have safe passage.
[01:47:57.427 --> 01:47:59.469]  He was immediately arrested last night.
[01:47:59.529 --> 01:48:01.131]  There are four right now holed up.
[01:48:01.932 --> 01:48:07.738]  A lady from New York Times actually was able to talk to a guy on the inside who runs a YouTube channel.
[01:48:08.528 --> 01:48:22.634]  Uh, he's there with a man and pregnant woman and another guy and they released a statement just now saying, uh, whatever, saying that, uh, that they would rather die than be, uh, taken into custody.
[01:48:22.694 --> 01:48:23.314]  Just totally.
[01:48:23.374 --> 01:48:24.594]  It sounds like it's staged.
[01:48:24.614 --> 01:48:25.775]  We know the whole thing's infiltrated.
[01:48:26.095 --> 01:48:29.158]  Right now the footage of the actual shooting between Oregon State Troopers and
[01:48:45.632 --> 01:48:48.233]  Yes, we're showing the video right now.
[01:48:48.253 --> 01:48:50.454]  You've looked at this, Joe.
[01:48:50.474 --> 01:48:51.435]  You're out there.
[01:48:51.515 --> 01:48:54.276]  Does it look like the FBI story is true?
[01:48:54.456 --> 01:48:56.117]  Or does it look like the people in the car story?
[01:49:04.855 --> 01:49:12.338]  Because of the angle, uh, because it's helicopter footage, it's kind of hard to tell if he's trudging through snow and it looks like his hands are up.
[01:49:12.438 --> 01:49:17.780]  I mean, I can't give an honest opinion, but the way it looked like is, is, uh, Amon Bundy's vehicle stopped.
[01:49:18.361 --> 01:49:25.103]  Um, they sat there, uh, Lavoie's vehicle sat there for a while with the female in there and, uh, Ryan Payne, I believe.
[01:49:26.244 --> 01:49:29.145]  That vehicle takes off at a high rate of speed for about a mile and a half.
[01:49:29.645 --> 01:49:31.646]  Uh, Dodge is a spike strip per, uh,
[01:49:32.455 --> 01:49:43.258]  The FBI, what they said, he avoided that spike strip and went off the road at the blockade, almost running over one of the FBI agents in there in the road, see the guy dive out of the way.
[01:49:43.718 --> 01:49:55.601]  The vehicle comes to a stop, LaVoy hops out, and this guy just hops out of the snow like a, you know, like a Special Forces, you know, crazy guy out of nowhere, just pops up out of the snow and jumps up and LaVoy turns around.
[01:49:55.941 --> 01:49:58.922]  And as he turns around, you can see his arms and everything move.
[01:49:59.389 --> 01:50:01.670]  And I don't think he was reaching for something.
[01:50:01.710 --> 01:50:02.010]  I don't know.
[01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.691]  It's hard to tell.
[01:50:03.191 --> 01:50:05.132]  But maybe they thought that at that point.
[01:50:05.932 --> 01:50:07.673]  See, I didn't know they almost ran somebody over.
[01:50:07.993 --> 01:50:08.474]  And I'm sorry.
[01:50:08.494 --> 01:50:08.994]  Try to run me over.
[01:50:09.014 --> 01:50:09.894]  You're going to have a problem.
[01:50:09.914 --> 01:50:11.035]  And I'm against what happened.
[01:50:11.475 --> 01:50:12.796]  I get why they're mad at the federal government.
[01:50:13.136 --> 01:50:15.737]  But I mean, now that we see this footage, it backs up what they said.
[01:50:16.678 --> 01:50:19.239]  And so far, I've been watching the footage three or four times here.
[01:50:19.259 --> 01:50:20.900]  Jakari Jackson, what do you think?
[01:50:21.664 --> 01:50:30.547]  Well, like I said, I'm looking at it right now, and you know, like I said, when you run off the road, whether it's accident, hook or by crook, you know, it's definitely going to agitate somebody.
[01:50:31.107 --> 01:50:33.448]  So, we're still waiting to see.
[01:50:33.468 --> 01:50:35.269]  I'll have to watch it again to see the full view.
[01:50:35.289 --> 01:50:41.031]  Well, you see him go, dodge, almost run the guy over, and then run into the snowbank, jump out, run around, and he gets shot.
[01:50:42.250 --> 01:50:42.790]  Yeah, I can't.
[01:50:42.850 --> 01:50:44.051]  I mean, I'm not defending it.
[01:50:44.111 --> 01:50:45.632]  I mean, I was totally against what happened in Waco.
[01:50:45.652 --> 01:50:47.033]  Oklahoma City was a staged event.
[01:50:47.753 --> 01:50:51.516]  It's just this thing was provocateur run from the beginning and is a disaster zone.
[01:50:51.796 --> 01:50:53.157]  And I warned everybody to get out of it.
[01:50:53.377 --> 01:50:55.218]  Because we're winning politically right now.
[01:50:55.518 --> 01:50:57.139]  We don't want to start a civil war.
[01:50:57.419 --> 01:50:59.340]  And everything Soros is doing is to do that.
[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:01.322]  Whether it's in Syria, Ukraine, or here.
[01:51:01.342 --> 01:51:02.642]  Yeah.
[01:51:02.902 --> 01:51:03.423]  Comments on that?
[01:51:04.346 --> 01:51:10.508]  Well, I mean, I agree, and I think it was, um, we did try to put that message out there that this isn't the way to do it.
[01:51:10.848 --> 01:51:12.149]  Like, I think your heart is pure.
[01:51:12.189 --> 01:51:14.610]  I don't think you're being led in the right direction.
[01:51:14.830 --> 01:51:15.050]  Sure.
[01:51:15.370 --> 01:51:15.870]  Let's go back.
[01:51:15.890 --> 01:51:18.931]  Let's go back to Sergeant John Wayne Walden, retired.
[01:51:18.971 --> 01:51:19.651]  Let's Google him.
[01:51:19.691 --> 01:51:21.812]  God, because there's no reason we should be alive.
[01:51:21.852 --> 01:51:25.473]  About 15 Americans went up, along with Afghani commandos.
[01:51:25.913 --> 01:51:32.936]  We went up against over 200 insurgents when they had the elevated position in the mountain, and after six and a half hours,
[01:51:34.057 --> 01:51:35.518]  70 danger close air strikes.
[01:51:36.199 --> 01:51:37.360]  10 silver stars given.
[01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:38.381]  Hey, wait a minute.
[01:51:38.801 --> 01:51:40.443]  Biggs, weren't you in this battle?
[01:51:41.284 --> 01:51:45.568]  I think you probably know this guy, because you were in a couple of those I've written about in Rolling Stone and Esquire.
[01:51:46.209 --> 01:51:53.856]  You don't know who Staff Sergeant John Wayne Walding is, Joe?
[01:51:54.637 --> 01:51:55.878]  I'm looking right now just to see.
[01:51:57.526 --> 01:52:00.689]  I was just hanging out with Leroy Petrie at SHOT Show.
[01:52:00.729 --> 01:52:05.713]  He was one of the last Medal of Honor recipients, so I'm still mind-blown by that entire experience.
[01:52:05.753 --> 01:52:08.255]  So let me look this up.
[01:52:08.275 --> 01:52:09.796]  I've met so many different people.
[01:52:10.116 --> 01:52:12.418]  But yeah, he was an SF guy, Battle of Shock Valley.
[01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:16.582]  I've never personally met him or anything like that before.
[01:52:16.602 --> 01:52:19.604]  He was just describing one that sounded like that one you were in with Hastings.
[01:52:20.165 --> 01:52:20.825]  Was that a different one?
[01:52:21.546 --> 01:52:22.807]  Oh yeah, that's something completely different.
[01:52:24.989 --> 01:52:32.176]  There's all kinds of stuff that happens in Afghanistan most people never hear about unless it really goes south and they start handing out awards and things like that.
[01:52:33.437 --> 01:52:35.179]  You know, that guy is a true hero.
[01:52:35.399 --> 01:52:42.186]  He was a Green Beret, Special Forces in the Army, all these guys out there that are getting the Medal of Honor doing all that stuff.
[01:52:42.906 --> 01:52:44.387]  Uh, true American heroes, you know.
[01:52:44.847 --> 01:52:47.228]  I can nowhere near come close to what these guys have done.
[01:52:47.248 --> 01:52:49.970]  Well, you heard him say, basically, hey, they're not just using us.
[01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:51.250]  I've gotten to know these people.
[01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.851]  They're for real.
[01:52:52.171 --> 01:52:57.434]  I get veterans not wanting to be used by people, but I mean, you can have your opinion about Trump.
[01:52:57.814 --> 01:53:00.595]  Look, Donald Trump's being boohoo about Fox News.
[01:53:00.655 --> 01:53:01.776]  I'm not being treated fairly.
[01:53:01.996 --> 01:53:02.916]  Come on, you're an adult.
[01:53:03.276 --> 01:53:04.457]  You're not being treated fairly.
[01:53:04.497 --> 01:53:06.098]  No one gets treated fairly all the time.
[01:53:06.358 --> 01:53:07.198]  You go do the debate.
[01:53:07.218 --> 01:53:07.819]  That's your job.
[01:53:07.839 --> 01:53:08.719]  You're running for president.
[01:53:09.019 --> 01:53:12.061]  You don't sit there and run and hide from Megyn Kelly and go hold a troop fundraiser.
[01:53:12.621 --> 01:53:13.922]  And then do that.
[01:53:13.982 --> 01:53:15.563]  That's what I'm saying he's exploiting.
[01:53:15.583 --> 01:53:25.270]  Because he's doing that to run from the Fox thing, to hold his own thing, trying to piggyback off the fact that Rand Paul did it, left a debate, didn't do it, and then he got more attention that way.
[01:53:25.310 --> 01:53:26.371]  Because it's all about ratings.
[01:53:26.391 --> 01:53:29.593]  Well no, of course it's a stunt.
[01:53:29.633 --> 01:53:31.074]  No one's denying it's a stunt.
[01:53:31.114 --> 01:53:35.377]  But I mean, what's wrong with pulling a stunt to dominate and win, if you're trying to beat Hillary Clinton?
[01:53:35.837 --> 01:53:36.778]  He's already dominating.
[01:53:36.918 --> 01:53:38.119]  He's already dominating everything.
[01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:40.102]  Not Iowa, not Iowa yet.
[01:53:49.710 --> 01:53:50.691]  So he set out that debate.
[01:53:51.051 --> 01:53:52.032]  Trump has a huge lead.
[01:53:52.432 --> 01:53:54.833]  It's really not any advantage for him to go there.
[01:53:54.873 --> 01:53:59.096]  He can only run into problems with them or be trolled by them and look bad.
[01:53:59.176 --> 01:54:01.017]  So it makes sense from that standpoint.
[01:54:01.037 --> 01:54:05.159]  But when you look at what Rand Paul did, Rand Paul took questions about policy.
[01:54:05.539 --> 01:54:10.642]  What Donald Trump is doing is he's holding an event because he doesn't want to talk about policy.
[01:54:10.742 --> 01:54:12.223]  That's my problem with Donald Trump.
[01:54:12.603 --> 01:54:15.485]  And I got to say that Politico had an article
[01:54:16.005 --> 01:54:19.387]  Maybe about a week ago, they were talking about Donald Trump's 19th century foreign policy.
[01:54:20.147 --> 01:54:24.649]  That was, I think, the most encouraging thing I've seen about Donald Trump, interestingly enough.
[01:54:24.689 --> 01:54:25.769]  I mean, Politico didn't like it.
[01:54:26.429 --> 01:54:39.455]  They said that his policies were kind of like Robert Taft, the last Republican that had policies like that, but that most of his policies went back to populism and protectionism of the 19th century.
[01:54:39.815 --> 01:54:40.455]  I agree with that.
[01:54:40.475 --> 01:54:40.996]  All right.
[01:54:42.516 --> 01:54:42.696]  Sure.
[01:54:42.716 --> 01:54:44.216]  Alright, we're going to come back to you guys.
[01:54:44.236 --> 01:54:44.497]  Absolutely.
[01:55:11.483 --> 01:55:13.248]  Go ahead and finish, we're just gonna go to break here a moment, go ahead.
[01:55:13.268 --> 01:55:16.437]  Okay, Rand Paul really nailed it in the back and forth between Rubio.
[01:55:16.697 --> 01:55:19.926]  Rubio only wants to talk about ISIS, and Rand Paul pointed out he said, look...
[01:55:20.646 --> 01:55:22.967]  Surveilling everybody hasn't protected anyone.
[01:55:23.007 --> 01:55:28.491]  And he goes back to the idea that, hey, wouldn't it be nice if we had a specific search warrant instead of a blanket search warrant?
[01:55:28.511 --> 01:55:30.072]  So he understands the principles.
[01:55:30.112 --> 01:55:31.292]  He understands the Constitution.
[01:55:31.312 --> 01:55:32.793]  He's not afraid to address those issues.
[01:55:33.013 --> 01:55:33.313]  All right.
[01:55:33.373 --> 01:55:33.954]  Thank you, David.
[01:55:33.994 --> 01:55:35.975]  We're going to pop back in with you guys in about 30 minutes.
[01:55:36.055 --> 01:55:38.676]  Right now, we're going to go to break for a little while.
[01:55:38.857 --> 01:55:41.158]  And you guys got a bunch of different interviews with Ron Paul today.
[01:55:41.598 --> 01:55:44.420]  We had the Trump insider on play one of those clips for about three, four minutes.
[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:49.843]  Or we can just go with this feed from George Washington or this John Wayne guy over here.
[01:55:50.223 --> 01:55:53.766]  And then we will come back to Jakari's lengthy take on this.
[01:55:53.826 --> 01:55:56.288]  Leigh Ann and then McBreen with a bunch of Twitter.
[01:55:57.529 --> 01:56:00.091]  Now I'm turning into Governor Perry, we call it the tweeter.
[01:56:00.451 --> 01:56:03.574]  With the tweeter questions, and we've only been on air like five hours today.
[01:56:03.894 --> 01:56:08.478]  And then we're going to again go through a bunch of Facebook comments straight ahead.
[01:56:08.818 --> 01:56:11.961]  And we'll get some of the Republican debate over on Fox.
[01:56:12.001 --> 01:56:14.122]  But quite frankly, I don't even have to look at the numbers.
[01:56:14.182 --> 01:56:16.924]  I guarantee you everybody's watching Trump, even though
[01:56:17.725 --> 01:56:22.089]  I think this rah-rah, pep rally, battle stories is probably not the best use of time.
[01:56:22.449 --> 01:56:26.532]  I wish policies were being discussed, but Trump gets, this is populist.
[01:56:26.872 --> 01:56:29.254]  He's going after people that have tuned out of politics.
[01:56:29.615 --> 01:56:30.475]  That's what they're doing.
[01:56:30.515 --> 01:56:34.198]  So, let's actually go to the Trump deal, because this guy's going off stage.
[01:56:34.679 --> 01:56:37.121]  Run that about five minutes, and we'll come back with our coverage.
[01:56:37.141 --> 01:56:38.221]  Stay with us at 4Words.com.
[01:56:40.263 --> 01:56:41.944]  This is awesome.
[01:56:42.024 --> 01:56:42.345]  Alright.
[01:56:45.945 --> 01:56:48.527]  So when you say thank you, I say you're worth it, and I mean it.
[01:56:50.608 --> 01:56:51.988]  But let me tell you something else, though.
[01:56:54.130 --> 01:56:58.832]  We lose 22 vets a day to suicide and lack of transition.
[01:56:59.333 --> 01:57:01.014]  And I can tell you, I felt that firsthand.
[01:57:01.034 --> 01:57:07.577]  Because not only when you get back, the military gives you a big old shopping cart full of drugs and says, hey, you got shot, take these.
[01:57:07.637 --> 01:57:08.458]  It'll make you feel better.
[01:57:09.278 --> 01:57:12.340]  And about after a year, I realized I'm healed.
[01:57:14.005 --> 01:57:14.886]  You know, I'm healed.
[01:57:15.126 --> 01:57:16.767]  My injury, my leg ain't growing back.
[01:57:16.847 --> 01:57:18.208]  I tried, you know.
[01:57:19.008 --> 01:57:22.491]  So anyway, I've tried.
[01:57:22.511 --> 01:57:23.371]  It ain't gonna heal.
[01:57:23.952 --> 01:57:26.553]  My incisions, stitches, everything out, it's not gonna heal.
[01:57:26.573 --> 01:57:27.154]  But guess what?
[01:57:27.994 --> 01:57:28.475]  I still hurt.
[01:57:29.175 --> 01:57:32.037]  I hurt every single day, and I know that will take it away.
[01:57:32.437 --> 01:57:36.200]  Fortunately, I had God, my family, and my country behind me.
[01:57:36.260 --> 01:57:37.641]  But not everybody gets to feel that.
[01:57:38.281 --> 01:57:41.223]  And you lose that compass, right?
[01:57:41.243 --> 01:57:43.625]  Whenever you get out, people don't care.
[01:57:45.123 --> 01:57:46.203]  You know, they don't care.
[01:57:46.404 --> 01:57:48.084]  Everybody loves you and they pat you on your back.
[01:57:48.605 --> 01:57:50.045]  But who's going to pay the bills, right?
[01:57:50.065 --> 01:57:52.866]  So when you get out, you don't know where that compass is spinning.
[01:57:52.906 --> 01:57:58.989]  I challenge you to find a veteran or someone that has better work ethic, better dedication than a veteran.
[01:57:59.209 --> 01:58:02.590]  But when that compass is spinning, that's when the insecurity builds in.
[01:58:03.011 --> 01:58:05.692]  That insecurity instantly becomes sadness because you're sad.
[01:58:05.712 --> 01:58:06.712]  You got the boo-boo lip out.
[01:58:06.732 --> 01:58:08.593]  That's what I call a boo-boo lip.
[01:58:08.993 --> 01:58:09.834]  I rarely bring it out.
[01:58:10.034 --> 01:58:10.514]  Only when I'm at home.
[01:58:11.303 --> 01:58:14.266]  But you get that out and that instantly becomes depression.
[01:58:14.546 --> 01:58:15.346]  You know, you get depressed.
[01:58:15.386 --> 01:58:16.327]  Man, I suck at life.
[01:58:16.387 --> 01:58:17.448]  I can't even pay my bills.
[01:58:17.889 --> 01:58:20.030]  You know, I don't get a paycheck on the 1st and 15th.
[01:58:20.551 --> 01:58:22.893]  And that four walls become a prison.
[01:58:23.113 --> 01:58:24.474]  You know, that's how it happens.
[01:58:25.435 --> 01:58:27.837]  And I want to punch that in the mouth.
[01:58:59.898 --> 01:59:02.081]  I'm not going to sit here and take it anymore!
[01:59:16.127 --> 01:59:19.289]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[01:59:19.569 --> 01:59:19.709]  Right?
[01:59:19.729 --> 01:59:22.091]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[01:59:22.451 --> 01:59:25.974]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[01:59:26.014 --> 01:59:29.176]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[01:59:29.676 --> 01:59:34.499]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:36.881]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[01:59:37.241 --> 01:59:41.684]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[01:59:41.824 --> 01:59:43.866]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[01:59:44.486 --> 01:59:45.947]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[01:59:46.087 --> 01:59:46.347]  Exactly.
[01:59:46.367 --> 01:59:50.350]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[01:59:50.690 --> 01:59:58.696]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:00:03.593 --> 02:00:08.596]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:00:08.836 --> 02:00:14.979]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:00:15.159 --> 02:00:22.123]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[02:00:22.463 --> 02:00:32.368]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[02:00:32.968 --> 02:00:38.892]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:00:39.132 --> 02:00:41.834]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[02:00:42.214 --> 02:00:43.675]  And adenosylcobalamin.
[02:00:43.976 --> 02:00:47.318]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:00:47.558 --> 02:00:49.179]  No needles, no injections.
[02:00:49.459 --> 02:00:50.960]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:52.201]  Try it for yourself.
[02:00:52.301 --> 02:00:54.262]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.
[02:00:54.603 --> 02:00:59.766]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:01:04.108 --> 02:01:10.951]  He's been neck and neck in polls lately, a few weeks ago, a few points behind Cruz, and some polls Cruz is ahead, some polls Trump's ahead.
[02:01:11.291 --> 02:01:12.251]  I know you're a straight shooter.
[02:01:12.291 --> 02:01:22.134]  I talked to you months ago, and you said Trump's got it everywhere but Iowa, but I still think he's gonna, you know, after that get New Hampshire and other states, but Iowa's the big one.
[02:01:22.655 --> 02:01:29.657]  Has he narrowed that gap, or has he surpassed it from your political expertise running so many big elections?
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:33.661]  Very hard to say because a caucus is not a primary.
[02:01:33.841 --> 02:01:41.582]  In a primary, you just show up, you go into the machine or the booth, and you mark a ballot, or you check off a name and you walk out.
[02:01:42.142 --> 02:01:43.422]  A caucus is very different.
[02:01:43.462 --> 02:01:47.783]  You've got to sit and listen to speeches for three hours, and then you vote by a show of hands.
[02:01:48.263 --> 02:01:51.424]  So this is very much an organizational exercise.
[02:01:52.084 --> 02:01:59.065]  I do know, and this is incredible, last night out of the phone bank in Des Moines, as a random test, they called 1,000 Democrats.
[02:02:00.836 --> 02:02:05.737]  These are working class, white, working class, suburban Democrats.
[02:02:06.337 --> 02:02:07.557]  They asked them two questions.
[02:02:07.837 --> 02:02:10.558]  One, did you vote for Barack Obama?
[02:02:10.958 --> 02:02:11.598]  90% said yes.
[02:02:12.218 --> 02:02:17.239]  When asked, would they come caucus for Donald Trump, over 300 people said yes.
[02:02:17.379 --> 02:02:25.240]  Now in Iowa, you can just show up at the polls and change your registration right then and there by signing a form and then vote for Donald Trump.
[02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:27.340]  This proves what I have been saying.
[02:02:27.441 --> 02:02:30.241]  He has crossover appeal in the general election.
[02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:42.019]  And to the extent that Iowa is up for grabs, and it is, it's very tight, it could be swayed by an influx of conservative Democrats coming over to make America great again.
[02:02:51.204 --> 02:02:52.564]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:02:52.845 --> 02:02:54.125]  You can't survive without it.
[02:02:54.345 --> 02:02:55.245]  But where do you get it?
[02:02:55.545 --> 02:03:01.287]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:03:01.527 --> 02:03:07.229]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:03:07.429 --> 02:03:24.308]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[02:03:24.688 --> 02:03:26.809]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[02:03:27.169 --> 02:03:28.370]  Stainless steel construction.
[02:03:28.650 --> 02:03:29.410]  Easy assembly.
[02:03:29.690 --> 02:03:30.310]  Low maintenance.
[02:03:30.591 --> 02:03:32.411]  Replacement filters are simple to install.
[02:03:32.691 --> 02:03:39.794]  And now, as part of an exclusive limited time introductory offer, you can save $20 off the retail price and get free shipping.

[02:04:14.324 --> 02:04:20.386]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, you can get six months free at PrisonPlanet.tv, but only for one more week.
[02:04:20.546 --> 02:04:23.807]  Next Monday, the special that only comes around once the year ends.
[02:04:23.887 --> 02:04:34.831]  In fact, we've never offered six months free before, but I really want to get more people to join and be able to watch the nightly news, to see the live reports we do, the special reports, all my films, e-books, and so much more.
[02:04:35.471 --> 02:04:47.300]  One person can share their membership with 20 people, and you are funding the absolute, very leading edge, the vanguard of the resistance to the globalist operation on every front.
[02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:52.104]  We have to have our own platform that is harder for them to censor, harder for the system to shut down.
[02:04:52.284 --> 02:04:53.945]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:04:54.025 --> 02:04:59.548]  We put out the daily radio show free with the video and audio feeds at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:04:59.688 --> 02:05:07.713]  But it is the members that get the nightly news exclusively and first and the commercial free video podcasts and audio podcasts that are
[02:05:07.813 --> 02:05:23.480]  Paying it forward and financing and helping so many other people see the truth when we put the videos on Facebook, YouTube, and it's PrisonPlanet.TV that finances so much of the cameras, the equipment, the crew.
[02:05:23.860 --> 02:05:24.560]  The reporters.
[02:05:24.920 --> 02:05:27.941]  You are becoming a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[02:05:28.201 --> 02:05:31.122]  You get exclusive HD, higher quality, get it first.
[02:05:31.242 --> 02:05:36.324]  And then you can download it, share it with friends and family, share your passcode with them, your username.
[02:05:36.524 --> 02:05:40.725]  It's a win-win, and then you're helping finance to put it out for free to everybody.
[02:05:40.925 --> 02:05:41.926]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:05:42.046 --> 02:05:42.926]  They're all sleeping.
[02:05:48.548 --> 02:05:49.948]  They're all sleeping, everybody.
[02:05:51.475 --> 02:05:54.877]  You know, I see two of my friends in the audience and they've become very famous and very rich.
[02:05:55.878 --> 02:05:58.179]  Come on, Diamond and Silk, get up here for a second.
[02:05:59.139 --> 02:06:01.261]  Diamond and Silk, these two are unbelievable.
[02:06:04.663 --> 02:06:08.565]  Melania called me, she said, you know, there's somebody that's so amazing, come here, you have to see this.
[02:06:09.085 --> 02:06:14.088]  And I came and I watched these two incredible women, these two beautiful women, and they were going rapid back forth.
[02:06:25.887 --> 02:06:27.248]  I personally like them.
[02:06:27.808 --> 02:06:34.512]  Whether they're right about Trump or not, it's good to see them energize politically and involve the political process because they say they never were before.
[02:06:34.532 --> 02:06:36.333]  I think they have some heckling going on here.
[02:06:36.653 --> 02:06:37.233]  Yeah, heckling.
[02:06:37.654 --> 02:06:39.234]  No, they're saying stump for the Trump.
[02:06:39.715 --> 02:06:43.877]  I think this is an infiltration.
[02:06:44.337 --> 02:06:44.758]  Amazing.
[02:06:46.538 --> 02:06:47.439]  They must have let folks see.
[02:06:47.459 --> 02:06:48.660]  They just gave tickets to everybody.
[02:06:48.780 --> 02:06:50.100]  They didn't control it like Hillary would.
[02:06:50.541 --> 02:06:50.721]  Right.
[02:06:51.621 --> 02:06:52.862]  Well, that's how you get a real reaction.
[02:06:53.662 --> 02:06:56.163]  Those are actually Trump supporters, but some of them look like they weren't.
[02:06:56.183 --> 02:06:58.445]  Oh, you're always going to have some infiltrators.
[02:06:58.465 --> 02:07:02.066]  Yeah, I really believe if we took them into a room and just talked to them, it would be fine.
[02:07:02.407 --> 02:07:02.927]  They'd understand.
[02:07:03.167 --> 02:07:04.188]  We want strength.
[02:07:04.388 --> 02:07:05.648]  We want good health care.
[02:07:05.708 --> 02:07:06.829]  We want protection.
[02:07:07.109 --> 02:07:08.050]  We want borders.
[02:07:08.130 --> 02:07:09.050]  We want the wall.
[02:07:09.130 --> 02:07:09.951]  We want the wall.
[02:07:10.171 --> 02:07:13.352]  We're going to make Mexico pay him the bill.
[02:07:13.432 --> 02:07:17.274]  If we could sit with them for about 10 minutes, maybe, maybe they'd understand.
[02:07:17.875 --> 02:07:18.255]  Say hello.
[02:07:19.621 --> 02:07:20.241]  How y'all doing?
[02:07:20.882 --> 02:07:23.403]  Trump knows exactly what he's doing.
[02:07:23.483 --> 02:07:24.784]  Not a staged debate.
[02:07:24.864 --> 02:07:29.045]  This is as big as Kennedy having makeup on when Nixon did in that first debate.
[02:07:30.146 --> 02:07:32.007]  Oh yeah, they said he looked weird.
[02:07:32.327 --> 02:07:34.808]  I mean, this is the fall of the mainstream media.
[02:07:34.908 --> 02:07:40.551]  Regardless of what you think about Trump, you are witnessing what Drudge talked about in 1999 at the press club.
[02:07:41.011 --> 02:07:42.151]  Oh, Richard took a picture with him.
[02:07:42.171 --> 02:07:42.672]  Look at Richard.
[02:07:42.732 --> 02:07:43.812]  I love Richard.
[02:07:43.872 --> 02:07:44.473]  Good creature.
[02:07:44.893 --> 02:07:45.953]  Richard's having a good time.
[02:07:45.993 --> 02:07:46.794]  Squeeze those cheeks.
[02:07:48.348 --> 02:07:49.390]  Richard's doing a good job.
[02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:51.713]  Richard's been working for Infowars for 15 years.
[02:07:52.014 --> 02:07:52.294]  Oh wow.
[02:07:52.695 --> 02:07:53.356]  No, is that long?
[02:07:53.716 --> 02:07:53.976]  Yeah.
[02:07:55.018 --> 02:07:56.921]  Yeah, about 14, 15 years.
[02:07:57.121 --> 02:07:57.982]  Off and on, you know.
[02:08:05.764 --> 02:08:08.426]  Yeah, me and Richard are good friends.
[02:08:09.186 --> 02:08:11.868]  He went back to Dallas to take care of his mom, but she broke her hip for a while.
[02:08:12.548 --> 02:08:15.350]  That's the guy I actually hang out and go out to dinner with and stuff, so.
[02:08:15.390 --> 02:08:15.850]  Yeah, good guy.
[02:08:15.870 --> 02:08:17.511]  Used to drive your bus, didn't he?
[02:08:17.531 --> 02:08:18.331]  Very good human.
[02:08:18.351 --> 02:08:21.493]  I want to hang out with Jakari, but he's always busy.
[02:08:22.313 --> 02:08:24.555]  We're going to start hanging out, aren't we, Jakari?
[02:08:24.575 --> 02:08:25.655]  We're going to start hanging out.
[02:08:32.509 --> 02:08:37.012]  Can I get the audio turned on just a little bit in my ear?
[02:08:37.052 --> 02:08:37.433]  A little loud.
[02:08:37.453 --> 02:08:38.954]  I don't know where your controller is.
[02:08:39.154 --> 02:08:40.075]  Oh, right.
[02:08:40.095 --> 02:08:41.175]  Was it something?
[02:08:41.876 --> 02:08:44.378]  They really have, they've become a sensation all over the internet.
[02:08:44.418 --> 02:08:45.679]  In all fairness, they've got so many feeds coming out.
[02:08:45.759 --> 02:08:46.099]  Oh yeah.
[02:08:46.119 --> 02:08:46.760]  No, you're right.
[02:08:46.860 --> 02:08:49.662]  This is when I bet you on everything I'm going to mean to them.
[02:08:49.702 --> 02:08:50.602]  So I'm just getting that out.
[02:08:50.642 --> 02:08:50.983]  We're not.
[02:08:51.003 --> 02:08:52.003]  We just have to communicate with the crew.
[02:08:52.023 --> 02:08:53.565]  We need strong leadership.
[02:08:53.805 --> 02:08:55.326]  We need compassionate
[02:08:55.866 --> 02:08:56.547]  Grab at them.
[02:08:56.867 --> 02:08:58.729]  We have to take care of our health care.
[02:08:59.049 --> 02:09:00.811]  We have to take care of our borders.
[02:09:01.091 --> 02:09:06.996]  We have to make our military so strong, so big, so powerful that nobody wants to use it.
[02:09:07.036 --> 02:09:08.418]  This is what I don't like.
[02:09:08.478 --> 02:09:09.198]  It already is so big.
[02:09:09.318 --> 02:09:11.000]  It's already half the global budget.
[02:09:11.100 --> 02:09:13.022]  That's another issue I have with Trump.
[02:09:13.062 --> 02:09:15.904]  He's always talking about rebuilding the military, as well as many other candidates.
[02:09:15.964 --> 02:09:16.845]  It's not just him.
[02:09:17.085 --> 02:09:22.110]  But he's, it's just pretty much a sideways saying that yes, I'm going to feed into the military-industrial complex.
[02:09:22.230 --> 02:09:26.814]  He needs to say we need human and we need ground troops, but we don't invade or attack people.
[02:09:26.834 --> 02:09:28.976]  But see, he's wrong on huge used military.
[02:09:29.297 --> 02:09:29.897]  Then he's right about...
[02:09:30.822 --> 02:09:35.684]  Don't go into Syria, don't topple Assad, don't have war with Russia, don't back ISIS.
[02:09:35.884 --> 02:09:37.905]  He does these incredibly good things, and then he does that.
[02:09:37.945 --> 02:09:38.625]  What do you think, Jakari?
[02:09:38.985 --> 02:09:40.105]  Yeah, just what I was saying.
[02:09:40.125 --> 02:09:41.746]  You know, he does say things that I agree with.
[02:09:41.806 --> 02:09:47.628]  I believe it was the last debate, maybe the debate before, he was talking about the situation with Assad and how that's being handled.
[02:09:47.868 --> 02:09:52.530]  He said we could have did a much better job spending that money here at home, as opposed to the way things are going over there.
[02:09:52.590 --> 02:09:57.732]  But, you know, he wants to rebuild the military, I guess is the talking point for the GOP.
[02:09:58.252 --> 02:10:00.334]  We have the strongest military on the planet.
[02:10:00.614 --> 02:10:04.838]  They're just pandering to the military-industrial conflicts, which Eisenhower warned us about.
[02:10:04.938 --> 02:10:05.339]  I agree.
[02:10:05.499 --> 02:10:05.879]  I agree.
[02:10:05.959 --> 02:10:12.385]  And before we go back to Lee Ann and then David Knight and Joe Biggs and McBreen, let's go to Ted Cruz for a moment.
[02:10:12.405 --> 02:10:17.490]  We've not been giving the Fox debate hosted by Caitlyn Jenner.
[02:10:18.251 --> 02:10:19.652]  We have not been giving it any attention.
[02:10:19.692 --> 02:10:20.292]  Let's go ahead.
[02:10:21.574 --> 02:10:24.937]  I watched the video of Senator Cruz.
[02:10:24.977 --> 02:10:26.679]  I watched the video of Senator Rubio.
[02:10:27.179 --> 02:10:28.120]  I heard what they said.
[02:10:28.601 --> 02:10:32.305]  And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
[02:10:35.504 --> 02:10:41.667]  I feel like I need, I feel like I need a Washington English Dictionary Converter, right?
[02:10:42.267 --> 02:10:43.728]  So far outside of Washington.
[02:10:43.748 --> 02:10:44.808]  We'll go back when it's Ted Cruz.
[02:10:44.848 --> 02:10:46.449]  You wouldn't believe how far.
[02:10:46.469 --> 02:10:48.270]  We're all outside of the establishment, let me tell you.
[02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:50.251]  Chris Christie is the establishment.
[02:10:50.411 --> 02:10:51.231]  Yes, I agree.
[02:10:51.531 --> 02:10:52.091]  You agree with that?
[02:10:52.332 --> 02:11:00.635]  Leanne McAdoo, we're going to go back to Trump and then to McBrain who's chomping at the bit obviously in the Twitter room, or the tweeters room as Perry would call it.
[02:11:01.176 --> 02:11:03.997]  Your view, we're even not arguing but debating during the break.
[02:11:04.557 --> 02:11:06.559]  You know, about is Trump good, is Trump bad?
[02:11:06.579 --> 02:11:07.900]  Look, at least we're debating.
[02:11:08.180 --> 02:11:09.982]  We know he's bringing in this populist movement.
[02:11:10.542 --> 02:11:13.345]  It was already there, but he's just showing how huge it is.
[02:11:13.905 --> 02:11:17.068]  And so, you were even saying, look at David, let him talk.
[02:11:17.488 --> 02:11:21.972]  The Knight's saying at least there's this 19th century Americana protectionist view.
[02:11:22.313 --> 02:11:26.657]  Globalism is about screwing us over through global trade, one-sided deals.
[02:11:26.777 --> 02:11:31.541]  That's why the Bilderberg Group, who is our sworn enemy and is running things, is against Trump.
[02:11:31.761 --> 02:11:35.846]  So I just can't sit here on the sideline and be a purist and say he isn't perfect.
[02:11:35.886 --> 02:11:36.807]  I'm criticizing him.
[02:11:37.148 --> 02:11:38.349]  I'm trying to influence him.
[02:11:38.750 --> 02:11:40.352]  He's invited me up to dinner in New York.
[02:11:40.812 --> 02:11:41.433]  And my son.
[02:11:41.753 --> 02:11:43.055]  And that's gonna probably happen.
[02:11:43.295 --> 02:11:44.497]  So I'm gonna go find out.
[02:11:44.537 --> 02:11:46.099]  But my God, don't we know Hillary?
[02:11:46.459 --> 02:11:47.801]  And don't we know Jabber Badness?
[02:11:48.281 --> 02:11:48.562]  Oh yeah.
[02:11:49.824 --> 02:11:51.226]  I'm not debating that one bit.
[02:11:51.266 --> 02:11:52.548]  There is no debate there.
[02:11:52.828 --> 02:11:58.235]  So yeah, and it seems like he does sort of have a few talking points there.
[02:11:58.536 --> 02:12:01.240]  He gets the hint sometimes and pulls it back.
[02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:02.842]  And Leigh-Anne, I've been ranting tonight.
[02:12:02.862 --> 02:12:03.443]  That's what I do.
[02:12:03.503 --> 02:12:04.204]  You've got the floor.
[02:12:04.264 --> 02:12:05.005]  Tell us what else you think.
[02:12:06.121 --> 02:12:09.042]  Well, I mean, I think, you know, that's what a lot of people don't understand.
[02:12:09.402 --> 02:12:11.842]  We are not controlled here at InfoWars.
[02:12:11.882 --> 02:12:21.885]  We all have our own opinion, which is why you kind of see it all over the place, because we don't have some dark lord above us, telling us what to think and say and feel.
[02:12:22.445 --> 02:12:23.745]  And, you know, I appreciate that.
[02:12:23.905 --> 02:12:31.947]  And, you know, you're not hiding and trying to show who you, oh, nobody should know who I care about or who I vote for.
[02:12:31.987 --> 02:12:33.948]  And I think that's, that's noble.
[02:12:34.008 --> 02:12:34.528]  I like that.
[02:12:34.688 --> 02:12:35.448]  People don't want
[02:12:37.372 --> 02:12:37.833]  Exactly!
[02:12:52.384 --> 02:12:52.724]  Bias.
[02:12:52.924 --> 02:12:54.705]  I think David made an excellent point one time.
[02:12:54.745 --> 02:12:58.568]  He said you show your bias by the stories you cover and the stories you don't cover.
[02:12:58.908 --> 02:13:00.288]  That alone shows your bias.
[02:13:00.309 --> 02:13:07.673]  And we cover liberty, freedom, private property, homeschooling, non-GMO, medical freedom, sovereignty, religious freedom.
[02:13:07.733 --> 02:13:08.953]  Just Bill of Rights, man!
[02:13:09.314 --> 02:13:10.414]  We're not that weird.
[02:13:10.454 --> 02:13:11.675]  We're just mainstream, really.
[02:13:11.935 --> 02:13:13.576]  But the globalists are so un-mainstream.
[02:13:13.976 --> 02:13:14.176]  Right.
[02:13:14.637 --> 02:13:16.217]  I mean, what is weird about Want More?
[02:13:16.237 --> 02:13:16.658]  You're taxing.
[02:13:17.418 --> 02:13:19.219]  What is weird about wanting to raise your own kid?
[02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:22.221]  What is weird about wanting to defend yourself because we can't afford bodyguards?
[02:13:22.441 --> 02:13:31.447]  I mean, I'm upper middle class, but I've invested most of my money that a major talk show host would have for a helicopter or a big house to hire a bunch of reporters and build something bigger, which is what we've done.
[02:13:31.848 --> 02:13:37.832]  But I mean, most of the time, you know, people just sit there and they go along with the system and they sell out.
[02:13:37.852 --> 02:13:38.872]  What were you saying, Jakari?
[02:13:38.892 --> 02:13:40.614]  I was just saying, I think he just finished his speech.
[02:13:41.508 --> 02:13:42.649]  Oh, that's not a good move.
[02:13:42.969 --> 02:13:44.530]  The debate's going to be going for like an hour.
[02:13:44.570 --> 02:13:50.534]  He's got total control of the... Maybe he's going to drive his car over there and pop up on the debate stage over at Fox News.
[02:13:50.774 --> 02:13:55.097]  He's going down into the media now to take over every channel that's there, including Fox.
[02:13:56.537 --> 02:13:57.958]  I bet money that's what he's doing.
[02:13:57.998 --> 02:13:58.499]  Cutting in.
[02:13:58.539 --> 02:13:59.499]  We have Donald Trump now.
[02:13:59.539 --> 02:14:00.260]  We need to go over to...
[02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:02.321]  Yeah, and I know I'm not going to Marco Rubio.
[02:14:02.702 --> 02:14:04.263]  I got a point I want to make, Alex.
[02:14:04.663 --> 02:14:05.664]  Yes, is this Kit Daniels?
[02:14:05.684 --> 02:14:06.144]  Yes, it is.
[02:14:06.785 --> 02:14:14.751]  That political article they just flashed on screens claiming that Trump has a 19th century interventionist policy or whatever it was.
[02:14:15.011 --> 02:14:20.235]  Let's not forget that the global elite, their foreign policy is dated back from the medieval times.
[02:14:21.016 --> 02:14:21.717]  I mean, I was reading yesterday.
[02:14:21.737 --> 02:14:22.758]  That's right, that's right, that's right.
[02:14:22.818 --> 02:14:23.979]  We're the Renaissance.
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:29.065]  George Washington is the Renaissance in slavery, in empires, personal liberty.
[02:14:29.085 --> 02:14:30.066]  Didn't mean they'd done it then.
[02:14:30.086 --> 02:14:31.267]  They were saying, we won't try.
[02:14:31.287 --> 02:14:32.008]  And you know what?
[02:14:32.028 --> 02:14:33.309]  America did do a lot of that.
[02:14:33.489 --> 02:14:35.752]  And now we've become what was 5,000 years old.
[02:14:36.072 --> 02:14:36.993]  So damn smart.
[02:14:37.193 --> 02:14:38.255]  I love my reporters.
[02:14:38.775 --> 02:14:40.596]  Yeah, I mean, I appreciate the compliment.
[02:14:40.796 --> 02:14:43.798]  But yeah, it's like June 21, all it is is neo-feudalism.
[02:14:44.399 --> 02:14:47.461]  And then I was reading yesterday on a battle that happened in Greece in like 1259.
[02:14:47.501 --> 02:14:51.263]  They were using deception, false flag attacks, what not.
[02:14:51.343 --> 02:14:52.784]  Same thing that's happening right now.
[02:14:53.205 --> 02:14:53.585]  Playbook.
[02:14:53.945 --> 02:14:56.547]  We don't want to be based on conquest, we want to be based on innovation.
[02:14:56.587 --> 02:14:58.208]  Jakari, I see you're chomping at the bit there.
[02:14:58.788 --> 02:15:02.471]  Oh, no, I was just enjoying the analysis there by Kit.
[02:15:02.511 --> 02:15:12.658]  Yeah, I agree with what Kit said there, you know, and it's really good that we do have researchers like Kit and, you know, the rest of the crew, all the guys who have contributed here tonight, the guys behind the scenes that really do care about these issues.
[02:15:12.678 --> 02:15:17.181]  We don't always agree on everything, but at the end of the day, I think everybody has the best of intentions.
[02:15:17.421 --> 02:15:24.166]  And we're working to bring you real information, teleprompter-free, so it is grassroots and populist, but look at that shot of Jakari right there.
[02:15:24.466 --> 02:15:28.008]  I mean, that looks better than HBO.
[02:15:28.108 --> 02:15:29.970]  And now, ladies and gentlemen, a Rolex commercial.
[02:15:30.230 --> 02:15:39.876]  But I mean, seriously... Well, I think what Kit Daniels, the point he makes is great, because that's exactly the gist of that article that was written by the Financial Times guy.
[02:15:39.896 --> 02:15:43.719]  He's like, the serfs are revolting, oh, this is terrible, we must stop this.
[02:15:44.175 --> 02:15:55.418]  Yeah, and the other thing I want to point out is that what Alex said earlier, I agree with a lot, is that Trump is drawing in a lot of people that are already tired of politics, haven't been paying attention for years.
[02:15:55.458 --> 02:15:58.479]  Because me, myself, I'm like a political atheist in a way.
[02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:00.760]  I don't really care that much about the presidential campaign.
[02:16:00.780 --> 02:16:01.720]  They want to turn us off.
[02:16:01.980 --> 02:16:03.041]  That's what they say in the article.
[02:16:03.081 --> 02:16:04.061]  He's turning us on.
[02:16:04.241 --> 02:16:07.402]  Whether he's good or not, baby, he's rising the dead!
[02:16:07.622 --> 02:16:10.263]  Yeah, I've got a huge... LORD HALLELUJAH!
[02:16:10.563 --> 02:16:11.984]  WAKE UP EVERYBODY!
[02:16:12.064 --> 02:16:12.344]  YEAH!
[02:16:14.028 --> 02:16:14.408]  Woo!
[02:16:15.569 --> 02:16:17.490]  There's a giant alien head behind you.
[02:16:17.930 --> 02:16:19.751]  Hey guys.
[02:16:20.291 --> 02:16:20.932]  Oh my gosh!
[02:16:21.312 --> 02:16:22.473]  It's Caitlyn Jenner!
[02:16:22.533 --> 02:16:22.993]  Hold on.
[02:16:25.914 --> 02:16:28.436]  She does look like in the new... What was the name of that?
[02:16:28.456 --> 02:16:30.197]  That's the worst I've ever seen her look.
[02:16:30.377 --> 02:16:30.497]  Me?
[02:16:30.537 --> 02:16:30.917]  The alien?
[02:16:30.957 --> 02:16:32.578]  Well they want to make her not look feminine.
[02:16:32.638 --> 02:16:33.419]  She's intellectual.
[02:16:33.439 --> 02:16:36.140]  This is all fake feminist garbage and women don't use their power.
[02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:37.601]  Women can be smart and good looking.
[02:16:38.161 --> 02:16:43.084]  She looks like the Cylon Raider leader in the episode out five, six years ago.
[02:16:44.577 --> 02:16:47.078]  In fact, Megyn Kelly may be a Cylon Raider.
[02:16:48.558 --> 02:16:49.458]  Do you guys realize that?
[02:16:51.939 --> 02:16:56.760]  Well, in the new Cylon movie that was on one of those channels, I watched a few episodes on a big TV viewer.
[02:16:56.940 --> 02:16:58.680]  They're humanoid robots.
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:01.601]  It's not like the guys with the toasters going, Cylon Raiders attack.
[02:17:01.861 --> 02:17:02.761]  You guys weren't alive then.
[02:17:02.821 --> 02:17:03.821]  Cylon Raiders attack.
[02:17:03.881 --> 02:17:04.761]  Battlestar Galactica.
[02:17:05.081 --> 02:17:06.002]  I don't know about a Cylon.
[02:17:06.062 --> 02:17:08.322]  Okay, well, she looks like a Cylon leader.
[02:17:08.682 --> 02:17:09.582]  They need a side-by-side.
[02:17:09.962 --> 02:17:12.663]  Oh my God, is Megyn Kelly a Cylon leader, folks?
[02:17:14.008 --> 02:17:14.728]  David Icke's right.
[02:17:15.709 --> 02:17:16.029]  Sorry.
[02:17:16.049 --> 02:17:17.890]  No, he's way ahead of his time.
[02:17:18.190 --> 02:17:19.271]  Cylon Raiders attack.
[02:17:19.531 --> 02:17:21.872]  When I was a kid I used to talk into a fan, it was in the summer.
[02:17:22.032 --> 02:17:22.913]  Oh, me too.
[02:17:23.193 --> 02:17:25.354]  Cylon Raiders attack, we have come to your planet.
[02:17:25.914 --> 02:17:27.415]  That's what I sort of wanted to do with voiceovers.
[02:17:28.516 --> 02:17:30.817]  I know, I know that guy's a Cylon Raider right there.
[02:17:31.117 --> 02:17:32.498]  That is a robot right there.
[02:17:34.019 --> 02:17:37.240]  You got Dan-O from Hawaii Five-O, Caitlyn Jenner.
[02:17:37.260 --> 02:17:38.321]  Hey Alex.
[02:17:38.621 --> 02:17:39.662]  And then you got Kendall.
[02:17:40.742 --> 02:17:42.183]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:17:43.396 --> 02:17:47.060]  Hey, Alex, in terms of what we were saying... Oh, back to serious stuff?
[02:17:47.100 --> 02:17:47.621]  Sorry, David.
[02:17:47.641 --> 02:17:48.142]  Go ahead.
[02:17:49.483 --> 02:17:50.384]  I want to get back to that.
[02:17:51.926 --> 02:17:54.128]  I'd like to go back even farther if I had my choice.
[02:17:54.649 --> 02:17:56.271]  I'd like to go back to the 18th century, but look...
[02:17:57.031 --> 02:18:05.957]  When Jefferson had his second inaugural address, one of the things he said was, by eliminating useless offices, we've been able to eliminate all internal taxation.
[02:18:06.298 --> 02:18:10.120]  What mechanic, what laborer, what farmer knows the taxman?
[02:18:10.481 --> 02:18:11.821]  Would we like to go back to those days?
[02:18:12.162 --> 02:18:14.964]  Jefferson knew the power was the rural areas.
[02:18:15.776 --> 02:18:16.096]  What's that?
[02:18:16.596 --> 02:18:18.277]  Jefferson knew the power was in Yeoman's hands.
[02:18:18.297 --> 02:18:25.220]  He said we're able to support this reduced-size government simply with taxes on goods that are coming into this country.
[02:18:25.540 --> 02:18:38.044]  So when they talk about protectionism or mercantilism, understand that they choose the words, and we know this, this is part of political correctness, they choose the words to forward their agenda.
[02:18:38.385 --> 02:18:42.166]  They want to call it 19th century, they want to call it protectionism, they want to call it mercantilism, okay?
[02:18:43.007 --> 02:18:48.190]  But when they talk about the globalists shipping our jobs abroad, they call that free trade.
[02:18:48.270 --> 02:18:55.173]  When they produce a treaty and don't go through the ratification process, they call that a free trade agreement.
[02:18:55.193 --> 02:19:02.137]  You don't need thousands of pages of regulations negotiated in secret by multinational corporations to have free trade.
[02:19:02.157 --> 02:19:02.657]  It's tyranny.
[02:19:02.757 --> 02:19:04.358]  They're bringing in centralized feudalism.
[02:19:04.378 --> 02:19:05.518]  You wouldn't be doing that.
[02:19:05.558 --> 02:19:08.480]  So the whole thing about free trade is total BS.
[02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:09.440]  We understand that.
[02:19:09.941 --> 02:19:12.282]  These labels that they're using simply don't apply.
[02:19:13.122 --> 02:19:33.594]  In terms of what we said before, do you have a couple of moments to talk about the... Yes, I want to get back into the whole Bundy thing, an update of your analysis on the video, and then we're going to go back to Derren McBreen, and then we're going to go to the Republican debate on Fox, and then we're going to go back to Jakari Jackson, and then we're going to go back to reporters in the control room, and Buckley Hammond, one of the founders of InfoWars, to get his take on the situation.
[02:19:33.614 --> 02:19:34.415]  But go ahead, David Knight.
[02:19:35.194 --> 02:19:36.375]  Oh, yes, Alex.
[02:19:36.895 --> 02:19:39.998]  In terms of what we were talking about, we got some people sending us some stuff on Twitter.
[02:19:40.298 --> 02:19:47.063]  When we were looking at this video of LaVoy Finnegan, we got to correct what we said about this because we were looking at a live feed that was jumpy.
[02:19:47.563 --> 02:19:49.084]  And that's what Biggs was saying.
[02:19:49.104 --> 02:19:50.565]  It looks like this guy jumped out of the snow.
[02:19:50.585 --> 02:19:53.828]  Looks like the guy had to jump to avoid Finnegan's truck.
[02:19:54.628 --> 02:19:55.989]  He was coming up to a roadblock.
[02:19:56.009 --> 02:19:57.730]  They had the cars across the road.
[02:19:57.770 --> 02:19:59.071]  They had a strip there.
[02:19:59.391 --> 02:20:18.944]  He was trying to go around them, and as we looked at a video that was put up on YouTube without the jumping, you can see an FBI agent or whoever, State Patrol, whatever, a law enforcement officer jumping out in front of his truck, and he turned to the left, avoiding him.
[02:20:19.651 --> 02:20:23.494]  What we were told by the FBI, the FBI does a little bit of narrative on it.
[02:20:23.534 --> 02:20:26.816]  So we saw a jumpy video where the FBI says, you almost struck one of our guys.
[02:20:26.836 --> 02:20:31.539]  Well, the guy left out in front of the truck and he turned further to the left to avoid him.
[02:20:31.659 --> 02:20:33.701]  Like he thought he was going to stop a moving vehicle.
[02:20:34.081 --> 02:20:34.521]  Exactly.
[02:20:34.541 --> 02:20:38.284]  I don't know what it was, but then in terms of whether or not he was trying to reach for his gun.
[02:20:38.928 --> 02:20:44.232]  When we looked at the video, I said, the first time we looked at it, even with a jumpy video, I said, looks like he's got his hands up.
[02:20:44.593 --> 02:20:47.195]  He's walking in the snow and his hands are going down occasionally.
[02:20:47.535 --> 02:20:49.276]  Maybe he's trying to get his balance or whatever.
[02:20:49.616 --> 02:20:50.517]  He does reach down.
[02:20:50.577 --> 02:20:54.220]  Some people have said that was when he was shot, he was reaching down to his side.
[02:20:54.721 --> 02:20:55.641]  Yeah, the first time.
[02:20:56.202 --> 02:20:58.163]  And he turns around, the guy shoots him.
[02:20:58.203 --> 02:21:02.807]  Now, the FBI is saying that he had a loaded 9mm inside his jacket.
[02:21:03.817 --> 02:21:06.758]  I wonder if he was intending to shoot the FBI.
[02:21:06.898 --> 02:21:08.719]  Why wouldn't he get out of the car?
[02:21:34.169 --> 02:21:35.350]  But we're going to stay here live.
[02:21:35.370 --> 02:21:41.434]  By the way, we've done an hour and twenty-something minutes of coverage here, teleprompter-free with one five-minute break.
[02:21:41.454 --> 02:21:47.258]  I want to just add here that we are funded by people buying pro-gun t-shirts, Hillary for prison t-shirts.
[02:21:47.498 --> 02:21:52.701]  We're naked libertarian free-market constitutionalists who are into human liberty and human empowerment.
[02:21:53.061 --> 02:22:01.187]  We sell the best nutraceuticals at the lowest prices, the very best rated water filters at the very lowest prices at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:22:01.747 --> 02:22:05.490]  And all of this, you see, was funded by viewers and radio listeners.
[02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:07.291]  A lot of radio stations pick this up.
[02:22:07.331 --> 02:22:08.872]  That's why we've been pretty much commercial-free.
[02:22:09.152 --> 02:22:10.493]  Some stations have been running ads over us.
[02:22:10.513 --> 02:22:10.954]  That's fine.
[02:22:11.714 --> 02:22:12.535]  They just say, can we carry it?
[02:22:12.575 --> 02:22:13.936]  I say, yeah, carry it, and all are in part.
[02:22:14.296 --> 02:22:16.278]  But now it's about 25 stations even carry this.
[02:22:16.318 --> 02:22:17.498]  I never even tried to promote that.
[02:22:17.559 --> 02:22:18.239]  That was for TV.
[02:22:18.659 --> 02:22:20.341]  We had over almost 200 on The Daily Show.
[02:22:21.181 --> 02:22:24.522]  So, what's happening here is people are hungry for their own news and media.
[02:22:24.962 --> 02:22:28.504]  A lot of stations now are doing their own analysis and own news on national stuff.
[02:22:28.524 --> 02:22:30.645]  They're done with propaganda media.
[02:22:31.285 --> 02:22:32.905]  And so, that's all we're doing here.
[02:22:33.025 --> 02:22:37.427]  And at InfoWarsLive.com, we have one of our flagship products, 25% off.
[02:22:37.607 --> 02:22:40.728]  It's going to sell out in the next few days by do-loss leaders, DNA Force.
[02:22:41.629 --> 02:22:47.151]  Most people don't have real iodine in their bodies, or the stuff that's out there in foods is bound, you can't absorb it properly.
[02:22:47.451 --> 02:22:50.172]  We have the true, purest iodine that we've ever been able to find.
[02:22:50.452 --> 02:22:51.633]  That we know that anybody has.
[02:22:52.374 --> 02:22:56.277]  X2, Game Changer, Supermale Vitality, Superfemale Vitality.
[02:22:56.637 --> 02:23:01.801]  You know, 99% of people that take this, you can read the five-star reviews, are blown away at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:23:02.081 --> 02:23:03.082]  I didn't spring this on you.
[02:23:03.102 --> 02:23:04.563]  I mean, I didn't tell you I wasn't springing this on you.
[02:23:04.824 --> 02:23:05.624]  I am springing it on you.
[02:23:05.985 --> 02:23:08.787]  Leanne McAdoo, you've taken Superfemale Vitality.
[02:23:09.167 --> 02:23:09.788]  What it do for you?
[02:23:10.888 --> 02:23:19.130]  Uh, well, it was like a major confidence booster, tons of energy, and, you know, I just felt very sexy and alive.
[02:23:19.150 --> 02:23:21.951]  Well, it wasn't hard for you to do, but you did feel better?
[02:23:22.511 --> 02:23:35.235]  No, I felt great, and like I say, I started taking it right when I was going through a bad breakup, so I should have been really sad and feeling really pathetic and, like, laying around and crying, but instead I was like, Wonder Woman!
[02:23:35.275 --> 02:23:36.495]  Like, it just, it was awesome.
[02:23:37.125 --> 02:23:37.405]  So yeah.
[02:23:37.465 --> 02:23:38.586]  You should be playing the new Wonder Woman.
[02:23:38.606 --> 02:23:40.986]  I had to stop taking it.
[02:23:41.947 --> 02:23:42.387]  But I'm glad.
[02:23:42.407 --> 02:23:43.628]  Well, now you've got a boyfriend again, right?
[02:23:43.648 --> 02:23:44.308]  So everything's good.
[02:23:44.328 --> 02:23:45.248]  No, I'm still single.
[02:23:45.528 --> 02:23:45.988]  Okay.
[02:23:46.429 --> 02:23:46.809]  All right.
[02:23:47.509 --> 02:23:50.290]  Well, anyways, don't torture the men out there with that information.
[02:23:50.650 --> 02:23:51.711]  No, no, seriously, folks.
[02:23:51.991 --> 02:23:52.631]  What do you think?
[02:23:52.911 --> 02:23:54.152]  Let's talk about this and go to Jeremy Brink.
[02:23:54.792 --> 02:24:00.634]  And then I want to actually get David Knight and the take from Beggs getting off this really sad subjects of using the veterans.
[02:24:00.834 --> 02:24:01.895]  And it did verge on that.
[02:24:03.195 --> 02:24:03.295]  Yes.
[02:24:18.012 --> 02:24:25.682]  Because I do that too on certain subjects, like provocateurs setting people up and they won't listen to me, because I'm a veteran of that, and it makes me mad when folks won't listen to me.
[02:24:25.902 --> 02:24:28.365]  So I get it when you know something and people won't listen to you.
[02:24:28.385 --> 02:24:30.808]  But seriously, Megyn Kelly, she's an attractive woman.
[02:24:31.429 --> 02:24:32.490]  She's smart, obviously.
[02:24:32.570 --> 02:24:36.715]  I'm glad they made her this big, you know, sex symbol, you know, Playboy magazine, whatever.
[02:24:37.216 --> 02:24:40.759]  But at the end of the day, you know, she did pick fights with Donald Trump.
[02:24:40.819 --> 02:24:43.662]  He used that to have an excuse to go take over the debate.
[02:24:43.982 --> 02:24:45.063]  What are you supposed to do to win?
[02:24:45.283 --> 02:24:48.386]  Politics is war by non-violent means.
[02:24:48.586 --> 02:24:50.508]  So people say, oh my God, they're running tricks to win.
[02:24:50.528 --> 02:24:56.513]  As long as you don't compromise on your basic things you stand for, you do use maneuvering to beat people.
[02:24:56.693 --> 02:24:59.095]  I mean, you know, that's how it is.
[02:24:59.175 --> 02:25:01.658]  I mean, I don't cheat at fighting until you got me on the ground.
[02:25:01.698 --> 02:25:02.338]  Then I'm going to bite you.
[02:25:02.358 --> 02:25:03.960]  I mean, that's just how this works.
[02:25:04.780 --> 02:25:05.821]  Uh, you know.
[02:25:05.941 --> 02:25:14.625]  So, Leigh-Anne, your view of the whole Megyn Kelly-Fox thing, as we watch the aftermath of this, I think it's clear, people tune in to Trump, not Fox News.
[02:25:14.925 --> 02:25:18.247]  They look like, speaking of cats, like they'd had a bunch of cold water thrown on them.
[02:25:19.107 --> 02:25:30.530]  Yeah, well, if we go back to that whole first hoopla with Megyn Kelly and her asking Donald Trump by throwing his own words back in his face, she wasn't wrong to do that.
[02:25:30.810 --> 02:25:35.592]  I mean, that's the big thing that the Democrats are always saying, oh, the Republicans war on women, war on women.
[02:25:35.612 --> 02:25:38.832]  So she was saying, Donald Trump, these are the things you say.
[02:25:39.253 --> 02:25:43.994]  How are you going to defend yourself against the whole war on women meme when you're saying
[02:25:44.434 --> 02:25:44.634]  This is
[02:26:08.433 --> 02:26:09.394]  I'm not really tuned into it.
[02:26:09.414 --> 02:26:10.235]  Women make jokes at me.
[02:26:10.275 --> 02:26:10.955]  I just laugh about it.
[02:26:10.975 --> 02:26:11.756]  Yeah, men are pigs.
[02:26:12.276 --> 02:26:13.557]  Okay, yeah, men are like cavemen.
[02:26:13.597 --> 02:26:14.598]  Okay, tell me something I didn't know.
[02:26:14.618 --> 02:26:16.940]  Well, I'm not, you know, your average woman.
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:22.385]  I don't really, I think it's funny and I kind of like hanging around the boys' locker room or whatever.
[02:26:22.405 --> 02:26:23.286]  Because you're confident?
[02:26:23.446 --> 02:26:24.887]  Yeah, it doesn't bother me.
[02:26:24.907 --> 02:26:25.708]  It doesn't affect me.
[02:26:25.808 --> 02:26:29.311]  So, and frankly, I don't think that it really affects Megyn Kelly either.
[02:26:29.391 --> 02:26:32.593]  I think she's just throwing those things back at him because, yes,
[02:26:33.535 --> 02:26:40.516]  For him being the frontrunner, those are the most powerful things where Hillary Clinton's gonna come around and go, oh, well, you said this and that, and...
[02:26:41.634 --> 02:26:42.355]  I agree.
[02:26:42.455 --> 02:26:44.716]  So let's say it.
[02:26:44.736 --> 02:26:47.418]  They're both pulling stunts on each other for their own fame.
[02:26:48.058 --> 02:26:49.139]  That's my one concern.
[02:26:49.239 --> 02:26:50.920]  Is he just doing this for his ego?
[02:26:51.141 --> 02:26:53.042]  Well, if he doesn't want to destroy the country, I don't care.
[02:27:11.634 --> 02:27:15.638]  Ja'Kari, what's your take on it?
[02:27:15.658 --> 02:27:16.839]  That's a very interesting exchange.
[02:27:16.879 --> 02:27:19.881]  Do you think Megyn Kelly is a Cylon?
[02:27:20.082 --> 02:27:20.842]  Cylon invader?
[02:27:21.763 --> 02:27:24.405]  I'll have to look more into that aspect of it.
[02:27:24.425 --> 02:27:29.770]  As far as the question, I think he made a joke about Rosie O'Donnell or whatever.
[02:27:29.790 --> 02:27:35.515]  If it's what the guy said, I guess that is somewhat fair game in a political context.
[02:27:35.675 --> 02:27:36.596]  I really wouldn't expect
[02:27:36.596 --> 02:27:39.698]  But Rosie's a public figure who makes, who attacks everybody.
[02:27:39.938 --> 02:27:45.042]  It's like if you attack Mother Teresa, you know, and say she's a, say, flying monkey for no reason.
[02:27:45.062 --> 02:27:46.683]  I'm not saying that, saying something mean.
[02:27:46.783 --> 02:27:48.344]  Or say Brother Teresa's a drug dealer.
[02:27:48.364 --> 02:27:48.964]  I'm not saying that.
[02:27:49.305 --> 02:27:52.667]  What I'm saying is then that's uncool because she's a nice, loving person.
[02:27:52.947 --> 02:27:53.908]  And she doesn't deserve that.
[02:27:53.928 --> 02:27:54.828]  It was a pious life.
[02:27:55.128 --> 02:27:58.911]  But if you're Rosie O'Donnell, the raunchy comedian... I'm by no means defending her.
[02:27:59.051 --> 02:28:01.012]  No, I'm not saying you are, Jakari.
[02:28:01.072 --> 02:28:02.692]  I'm just saying, isn't she then fair game?
[02:28:02.953 --> 02:28:04.453]  Yeah, she's a public figure.
[02:28:04.573 --> 02:28:05.474]  I mean, I'm fair game.
[02:28:05.774 --> 02:28:07.754]  They claim all sorts of BS about me.
[02:28:08.075 --> 02:28:18.099]  Right, but then, but see, then he kind of showed where he was, his colors, because then he calls her a bimbo, says that she must have been on her period, and that's why she was being so... He said she was bleeding.
[02:28:18.599 --> 02:28:19.039]  Right.
[02:28:19.059 --> 02:28:20.159]  Out her eyes.
[02:28:20.179 --> 02:28:21.240]  And other places.
[02:28:22.060 --> 02:28:24.602]  He said out of her eyes and her who knows where.
[02:28:24.662 --> 02:28:26.203]  Well, Leigh-Anne, let's be honest.
[02:28:26.363 --> 02:28:31.166]  I'm the woman here, so I get to say from my perspective and, you know, it is what it is.
[02:28:31.626 --> 02:28:33.287]  I personally, it doesn't bother me.
[02:28:33.447 --> 02:28:33.988]  I don't care.
[02:28:34.368 --> 02:28:37.130]  But I don't even think the issue is Megyn Kelly.
[02:28:37.170 --> 02:28:41.472]  I think it's the fact that he's just calling Fox News out for putting pieces on him.
[02:28:41.692 --> 02:28:44.854]  They're using that because then they can say, oh, Trump's weak.
[02:28:44.874 --> 02:28:45.695]  Let me get serious with you.
[02:28:45.735 --> 02:28:46.896]  He can't even sit up against a girl.
[02:28:46.976 --> 02:28:47.696]  Let me get serious with you.
[02:28:48.177 --> 02:28:49.878]  Where is the secret Wonder Woman Island?
[02:28:50.578 --> 02:28:51.439]  And the invisible plane.
[02:28:51.539 --> 02:28:52.000]  I want to go.
[02:28:52.020 --> 02:28:52.981]  I can't tell you that.
[02:28:53.582 --> 02:28:55.665]  Jakari, if she has an invisible jet, are we getting on board?
[02:28:55.725 --> 02:28:59.890]  We should all fly there someday and report from the Secret Island.
[02:28:59.950 --> 02:29:02.413]  As you notice, we're not talking about the debater tonight.
[02:29:02.854 --> 02:29:06.679]  Anyways, getting back to... Oh my gosh, is there a giant chipmunk on screen?
[02:29:07.140 --> 02:29:08.341]  I mean, good God.
[02:29:09.414 --> 02:29:11.456]  You know, my kids teach me, they go, you look like Chris Christie.
[02:29:11.756 --> 02:29:13.477]  And that's why I've lost 70 pounds now.
[02:29:13.597 --> 02:29:15.979]  In fact, I mean, I'm going to soon take photos, folks.
[02:29:16.299 --> 02:29:20.322]  The products in Ford's life are incredible, but I do still look like a pumpkin head.
[02:29:20.622 --> 02:29:21.383]  Bob's big boy.
[02:29:22.103 --> 02:29:23.484]  Who is that, Jakari?
[02:29:24.425 --> 02:29:25.866]  Oh, man, who does he look like?
[02:29:26.086 --> 02:29:26.707]  I'm not sure.
[02:29:27.708 --> 02:29:30.049]  Does Darren McBreen have something from the tweeter station?
[02:29:30.089 --> 02:29:32.271]  Yeah, let's go to the tweeter station to quote Rick Perry.
[02:29:32.811 --> 02:29:36.014]  Darren McBreen of Darth Vader Tyrannosland.
[02:29:36.889 --> 02:29:47.393]  Well guys, we're not only monitoring Twitter and Facebook, we've also been turning the channels, clicking through the channels, checking out the mainstream media's reaction to Donald Trump not showing up at the debate tonight.
[02:29:47.673 --> 02:29:53.235]  And when you know it, they uniformly say that it is a huge mistake, that it's a bad move.
[02:29:53.496 --> 02:29:54.076]  Bad Trump!
[02:29:54.196 --> 02:29:54.716]  Bad Trump!
[02:29:55.096 --> 02:29:57.037]  He's not doing it right.
[02:29:57.177 --> 02:29:59.278]  And are they also saying that we didn't build our businesses?
[02:30:00.407 --> 02:30:08.169]  Well, no, but they are saying that this is a golden opportunity for the other candidates to finally step up to the plate because now they're not being distracted.
[02:30:08.449 --> 02:30:10.449]  They've been pushing Rubio the last two days.
[02:30:10.749 --> 02:30:11.750]  Rubio's gonna shine.
[02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:13.150]  Rubio, Rubio, Rubio.
[02:30:13.470 --> 02:30:15.611]  Fox News, CNN, oh Rubio, Rubio.
[02:30:15.791 --> 02:30:17.211]  Did you hear about Rubio, Rubio?
[02:30:17.471 --> 02:30:18.871]  That tells me Rubio's mad.
[02:30:19.351 --> 02:30:20.232]  Rubio's mad news.
[02:30:20.292 --> 02:30:20.572]  Rubio.
[02:30:21.952 --> 02:30:28.434]  It can't be Rand Paul, who everyone says dominated that last debate, and I like the way that he did it.
[02:30:28.534 --> 02:30:32.935]  He went live on Periscope and took people's questions live, and did his own thing.
[02:30:32.955 --> 02:30:34.075]  Yeah, Trump's copying that.
[02:30:34.495 --> 02:30:35.855]  But he didn't go into any politics.
[02:30:35.875 --> 02:30:37.256]  Who has cooler hair, though?
[02:30:38.336 --> 02:30:42.357]  Rubio, Trump, or Rand Paul?
[02:30:43.017 --> 02:30:43.637]  Dakari Jackson.
[02:30:43.677 --> 02:30:46.418]  Rand Paul probably looks the most natural to me.
[02:30:47.978 --> 02:30:50.099]  I don't know what that thing on Donald Trump's head is.
[02:30:50.559 --> 02:30:54.641]  I've seen interviews where he actually lets people touch his hair, so it may be in there.
[02:30:54.661 --> 02:30:56.642]  Do you want to touch it?
[02:30:56.702 --> 02:30:57.862]  I think it is his hair.
[02:30:57.882 --> 02:30:59.583]  I would prefer not.
[02:31:01.384 --> 02:31:07.607]  You know what's funny is that because Donald Trump has been around for so long and he's always had that same hair, like I have...
[02:31:08.712 --> 02:31:18.836]  For years, like I've gone in and I zoom in and I'm like, what is... Yeah, be honest, as a woman, as a woman, what do you... to a man, are you attracted to Trump?
[02:31:19.136 --> 02:31:23.618]  I would have told him to like shave his head a long time ago or something, you know, like just go with it, man.
[02:31:23.638 --> 02:31:26.239]  Can we photoshop a bald-headed Trump?
[02:31:27.900 --> 02:31:30.021]  Oh, where's the picture with Trump with the man bun?
[02:31:31.005 --> 02:31:32.346]  Oh my gosh, Gracie.
[02:31:32.766 --> 02:31:34.748]  Listen folks, we're a serious show all day.
[02:31:34.768 --> 02:31:35.889]  We're having a little bit of fun here.
[02:31:35.909 --> 02:31:39.131]  But back to Darren McBrain and then back to David Knight and them if they're still there.
[02:31:40.612 --> 02:31:47.297]  Well alright, well Fox News was saying that Donald Trump was a big distraction before, but now he's even more of a distraction.
[02:31:47.317 --> 02:31:51.060]  If anything, he's more of a distraction now than he ever was because everybody's paying attention to him.
[02:31:51.080 --> 02:31:53.982]  So I don't think it was a mistake for Donald Trump.
[02:31:54.902 --> 02:31:58.125]  Sorry, this looks like it ran straight in his hair or something under criticism.
[02:31:58.165 --> 02:31:59.406]  Oh man, I want to do that one.
[02:32:00.208 --> 02:32:01.009]  Oh, what is that?
[02:32:01.029 --> 02:32:02.971]  Did you hear Trump actually trained as a sumo wrestler?
[02:32:03.011 --> 02:32:03.511]  I'm sorry.
[02:32:04.552 --> 02:32:06.354]  Best Chris Christie's brother.
[02:32:06.534 --> 02:32:08.737]  Yes, Chris Christie, I'm your brother.
[02:32:09.297 --> 02:32:10.478]  That sumo wrestler guy.
[02:32:10.819 --> 02:32:11.319]  I'm sorry.
[02:32:11.539 --> 02:32:12.540]  Go back to you, McBrain.
[02:32:12.560 --> 02:32:12.881]  Sorry.
[02:32:12.901 --> 02:32:14.562]  You do this every night.
[02:32:14.582 --> 02:32:15.143]  Isn't this fun?
[02:32:18.066 --> 02:32:19.067]  You know what?
[02:32:19.187 --> 02:32:20.288]  I like that hairdo, though.
[02:32:20.328 --> 02:32:21.149]  It's pretty badass.
[02:32:21.529 --> 02:32:22.550]  Alex, you'd look good with that.
[02:32:22.791 --> 02:32:23.852]  Yeah, you need a man bun.
[02:32:25.440 --> 02:32:27.721]  Alex Man Bun Jones!
[02:32:28.361 --> 02:32:32.702]  Did you see the sumo wrestler out there at the Bundy thing?
[02:32:32.802 --> 02:32:34.723]  Some things that are seen cannot be unseen.
[02:32:35.043 --> 02:32:35.603]  Exactly.
[02:32:35.623 --> 02:32:40.345]  Well, I like what Rand Paul is saying here, is leaving it to the states, introduce solution.
[02:32:40.365 --> 02:32:44.706]  McBrain, let's go over some comments from the Twitterverse.
[02:32:46.467 --> 02:32:47.367]  You know what, Alex?
[02:32:47.467 --> 02:32:48.547]  There's all kinds of comments.
[02:32:48.567 --> 02:32:51.428]  There's really nothing right now that we've got for you, buddy.
[02:32:52.449 --> 02:32:52.789]  Other than
[02:32:53.922 --> 02:32:55.083]  Comments about McAdoo.
[02:32:56.104 --> 02:33:01.348]  We have the Brandwatch polls right now saying that Rand Paul is at 71%.
[02:33:01.408 --> 02:33:02.609]  You're on air right now, right, Marcos?
[02:33:02.870 --> 02:33:03.030]  Yep.
[02:33:03.370 --> 02:33:04.010]  I'm on air right now.
[02:33:04.371 --> 02:33:05.852]  As you always tell me, I have great stuff to say.
[02:33:05.872 --> 02:33:06.473]  Just come on air.
[02:33:06.593 --> 02:33:07.954]  Let's have a free-for-all in the control room.
[02:33:09.773 --> 02:33:11.754]  It's an InfoWars free-for-all.
[02:33:11.774 --> 02:33:12.734]  What do you think of Dan-O?
[02:33:12.974 --> 02:33:15.636]  Can you believe they actually froze the guy from Hawaii Five-0 in the 70s?
[02:33:15.676 --> 02:33:16.656]  He's back on TV.
[02:33:16.676 --> 02:33:22.539]  So this is what, from social media's opinion of who's got the debate right now?
[02:33:22.999 --> 02:33:23.399]  Marcos?
[02:33:24.079 --> 02:33:28.701]  Yeah, let's Google polls on debate real-time and see which one's scientific with phone calls.
[02:33:28.901 --> 02:33:31.022]  Plus, they also usually have the Drudge Poll going.
[02:33:31.402 --> 02:33:34.564]  Let's see the Drudge Report, the MightyDrudgeReport.com poll.
[02:33:34.724 --> 02:33:36.264]  Are we running an InfoWars poll tonight?
[02:33:36.485 --> 02:33:37.265]  That's a big question.
[02:33:39.258 --> 02:33:41.839]  Look, they've all got American flags to let you know they're with America.
[02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:44.441]  Yeah, just in case you forgot which country you lived in.
[02:33:44.701 --> 02:33:46.002]  Yeah, yeah, let's go over these polls.
[02:33:46.042 --> 02:33:46.602]  Here, Trump.
[02:33:47.603 --> 02:33:48.843]  You guys put that on the main screen?
[02:33:48.903 --> 02:33:50.444]  My eyes aren't that good.
[02:33:50.664 --> 02:33:52.065]  I still got 2020 in it and 2015.
[02:33:52.265 --> 02:33:53.806]  Trump, Cruz, Rubio, Paul.
[02:33:54.246 --> 02:33:56.167]  Trump has a whopping, I think that's 56%.
[02:33:56.207 --> 02:33:57.228]  We put that, there we go.
[02:33:57.248 --> 02:33:58.609]  56, that's pretty good for 15 feet.
[02:33:58.629 --> 02:33:59.709]  56.93, at least at 2015, brother.
[02:33:59.729 --> 02:33:59.949]  Cruz, 22.48, Rubio.
[02:34:08.554 --> 02:34:11.176]  8.31.
[02:34:08.714 --> 02:34:11.176]  It's kind of good not having a photographic memory anymore.
[02:34:11.196 --> 02:34:12.056]  It was kind of painful before.
[02:34:12.796 --> 02:34:14.537]  Paul, I don't have it anymore.
[02:34:14.557 --> 02:34:15.278]  That's right, folks.
[02:34:15.298 --> 02:34:15.278]  6.35.
[02:34:15.658 --> 02:34:16.879]  Christie and his brother get 1.41.
[02:34:17.379 --> 02:34:19.260]  Kasich, they give half the debate to.
[02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:19.260]  1.2.
[02:34:19.300 --> 02:34:19.600]  Carson, 1.11.
[02:34:19.660 --> 02:34:19.900]  Good God.
[02:34:19.940 --> 02:34:20.160]  Bush, 0.93.
[02:34:20.401 --> 02:34:22.202]  It's incredible how far Carson has fallen.
[02:34:33.541 --> 02:34:36.482]  They got James Woods in drag, 0.84.
[02:34:37.102 --> 02:34:40.083]  Huckabee at 0.24, and Santorum at 0.2.
[02:34:40.163 --> 02:34:42.664]  Santorum is a titan!
[02:34:43.244 --> 02:34:43.465]  Yeah.
[02:34:43.745 --> 02:34:45.425]  Oh, that's how they promote the guy.
[02:34:45.445 --> 02:34:46.766]  I didn't even know that they were running.
[02:34:46.866 --> 02:34:47.326]  I'm sorry.
[02:34:47.366 --> 02:34:53.368]  Until today, when I saw that they were going to go to Trump's deal, I was like, oh wow, they're still... I knew Huckabee was in it.
[02:34:53.748 --> 02:34:57.130]  Yeah, Santorum... What about Dano?
[02:34:57.170 --> 02:34:58.850]  He's going to win, right?
[02:34:59.230 --> 02:35:01.011]  He's probably going to win Journalist of the Year.
[02:35:03.632 --> 02:35:04.272]  I'm okay with that.
[02:35:04.532 --> 02:35:06.694]  I think he's the only person I know that has a wider jaw than mine.
[02:35:06.974 --> 02:35:09.295]  It actually makes me embarrassed.
[02:35:09.315 --> 02:35:10.936]  You like, that's your badge of honor?
[02:35:11.556 --> 02:35:12.036]  Here's my what?
[02:35:12.377 --> 02:35:14.498]  That's your badge of honor to have the wide jaw?
[02:35:14.758 --> 02:35:15.418]  No, it's not.
[02:35:15.438 --> 02:35:15.858]  I don't.
[02:35:16.339 --> 02:35:16.859]  It's painful.
[02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:19.320]  I have TMJ right now.
[02:35:19.460 --> 02:35:20.501]  It's not fun.
[02:35:20.621 --> 02:35:23.462]  Alright, let's get serious and go back to Derren McBrain.
[02:35:23.482 --> 02:35:26.684]  Derren, I know we have massive tweet comments, massive Facebook comments.
[02:35:26.704 --> 02:35:30.186]  Let's go to Facebook and let's read the comments that are not about Liam.
[02:35:31.311 --> 02:35:36.114]  Leanne, I'm telling you, head-to-head against Megyn Kelly on a similar channel, you would annihilate her.
[02:35:37.135 --> 02:35:38.175]  Because you're smarter than her.
[02:35:39.897 --> 02:35:42.318]  And... And why?
[02:35:42.678 --> 02:35:43.879]  She has the lasso of truth.
[02:35:44.319 --> 02:35:45.780]  She has the lasso?
[02:35:46.341 --> 02:35:48.042]  Jakari, are you psychic?
[02:35:50.229 --> 02:35:51.289]  Let's go to Marco Rubio.
[02:35:51.309 --> 02:35:52.210]  Let's hear from this idiot.
[02:35:52.370 --> 02:35:52.850]  Yes, I'm biased.
[02:36:14.258 --> 02:36:15.899]  Let's give some more time to Kasich.
[02:36:15.939 --> 02:36:18.080]  The whole time, I've been deciding what to put on screen.
[02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:20.181]  We got all these TVs down here below, you can't see them.
[02:36:20.301 --> 02:36:22.002]  Kasich is on like half the time.
[02:36:22.022 --> 02:36:24.444]  What is this guy on constantly about?
[02:36:24.464 --> 02:36:27.025]  I know, they give him so much time.
[02:36:27.045 --> 02:36:27.585]  Good God!
[02:36:27.685 --> 02:36:31.267]  I mean, I have nothing to throw up here.
[02:36:31.427 --> 02:36:33.529]  Rand Paul should be on this damn stage.
[02:36:33.589 --> 02:36:35.910]  He is, but they don't ever go to him.
[02:36:36.030 --> 02:36:38.732]  No, I know, I know he's over there, but I mean, he should be being covered.
[02:36:38.792 --> 02:36:40.012]  No, that's the thing.
[02:36:40.072 --> 02:36:41.193]  I mean, we've seen it time and time again.
[02:36:41.213 --> 02:36:41.853]  Did he get back on?
[02:36:43.494 --> 02:36:44.595]  Trump jumped off?
[02:36:46.096 --> 02:36:48.657]  No, what they did last time was they rigged the polls.
[02:36:48.697 --> 02:36:57.843]  David explains it much better than I do, but one of the polls that would have had him on the stage, they held it for about 24 hours and they said, oh, sorry, you didn't make it.
[02:36:57.883 --> 02:37:03.306]  Well, let's shut Kasich up then, and let's see if David Nye is still there with Biggs.
[02:37:04.567 --> 02:37:05.128]  They're gone.
[02:37:05.148 --> 02:37:05.708]  They went to sleep?
[02:37:07.614 --> 02:37:08.215]  I love Biggs.
[02:37:08.495 --> 02:37:10.056]  I said I'd go to bed if they wanted to.
[02:37:10.276 --> 02:37:11.357]  Well, let's get them reconnected.
[02:37:11.737 --> 02:37:14.180]  Biggs literally looks like my cat in the morning when it's angry, though.
[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:15.521]  He was like curled up there.
[02:37:15.541 --> 02:37:17.262]  And he was just like, yeah.
[02:37:17.883 --> 02:37:22.386]  And I'm going to tell him that I have some friskies for him.
[02:37:23.007 --> 02:37:24.168]  And that'll make it all better.
[02:37:27.504 --> 02:37:28.225]  Oh my god.
[02:37:28.605 --> 02:37:29.606]  Hey, you guys like me at night?
[02:37:29.626 --> 02:37:32.368]  You know, my radio show used to be more popular at night.
[02:37:32.388 --> 02:37:33.189]  It had huge ratings.
[02:37:33.629 --> 02:37:36.832]  And then I went to GCN and they said, no, you're going to do daytime with significance Rush Limbaugh.
[02:37:37.152 --> 02:37:37.773]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[02:37:37.793 --> 02:37:38.713]  And nighttime was much funner.
[02:37:38.733 --> 02:37:41.255]  Well, controversial stuff usually does pretty better at night.
[02:37:41.335 --> 02:37:41.756]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:37:42.276 --> 02:37:43.377]  And then I would screw around more, yeah.
[02:37:43.778 --> 02:37:46.079]  Like George Norian, all that kind of stuff.
[02:37:46.480 --> 02:37:46.780]  Exactly.
[02:37:48.602 --> 02:37:51.144]  But seriously, I was saying they could punch out if they wanted to.
[02:37:51.954 --> 02:37:58.297]  You know, but I'm tempted to just open the phones up here because... Or do we really want to hear what the Governor Kasich has to say?
[02:37:58.357 --> 02:37:59.497]  I don't want to hear anything from this guy.
[02:37:59.537 --> 02:38:00.278]  Why is he still talking?
[02:38:00.518 --> 02:38:00.738]  Why?
[02:38:01.238 --> 02:38:01.858]  Am I lying?
[02:38:02.078 --> 02:38:03.339]  Has he been up there like a third of the time?
[02:38:03.359 --> 02:38:04.559]  No, he's up there all the time.
[02:38:04.579 --> 02:38:06.880]  When you just read the polls, he's way down in the polls.
[02:38:06.940 --> 02:38:08.221]  I think he was in, not even at 1%.
[02:38:08.361 --> 02:38:10.582]  No, it's just like... Yeah, that's in a drudge poll.
[02:38:10.622 --> 02:38:11.903]  In scientific, it's like 3%.
[02:38:12.123 --> 02:38:13.023]  Well, it's 3%.
[02:38:13.523 --> 02:38:14.184]  You know, you're right.
[02:38:14.244 --> 02:38:15.584]  It was like less than 1% in the thing.
[02:38:15.824 --> 02:38:16.404]  I mean, why?
[02:38:16.485 --> 02:38:17.285]  Okay, let's hear from him.
[02:38:18.151 --> 02:38:20.512]  He says I'm going to blow Russia up.
[02:38:20.532 --> 02:38:21.692]  That's what I'm going to do.
[02:38:21.772 --> 02:38:25.833]  I'm going to blow Russia up because they didn't do anything.
[02:38:25.973 --> 02:38:28.454]  Or ISIS, who this government created, Danno.
[02:38:28.474 --> 02:38:28.934]  Well, Danno!
[02:38:35.916 --> 02:38:37.998]  You are sexist for merely suggesting that they should ask Hillary Clinton.
[02:38:49.438 --> 02:38:55.444]  Alright, well, Christie's talking about, uh, what's she talking about?
[02:38:56.004 --> 02:38:56.925]  Oh, there we go.
[02:38:57.065 --> 02:39:05.193]  Yes, and now we know from some of her released emails that she initially wanted to take credit for Libya, and now she's... Alright, I'm gonna talk to her.
[02:39:05.213 --> 02:39:06.874]  Talk to Alex, please don't wake up the baby.
[02:39:06.894 --> 02:39:07.175]  Hold on.
[02:39:07.195 --> 02:39:09.256]  Hold on, I'm calling back.
[02:39:09.417 --> 02:39:09.817]  Oh, okay.
[02:39:15.649 --> 02:39:17.209]  Biggs, I didn't want you guys to go off.
[02:39:17.329 --> 02:39:19.370]  I've got you a whole can of Friskies.
[02:39:24.091 --> 02:39:25.751]  Listen, I got you on air right now.
[02:39:25.791 --> 02:39:26.151]  Hold on.
[02:39:26.631 --> 02:39:26.931]  Listen.
[02:39:27.191 --> 02:39:28.251]  Listen, I was just joking.
[02:39:28.271 --> 02:39:29.692]  You just looked so upset during the debate.
[02:39:29.712 --> 02:39:30.352]  I felt sorry.
[02:39:30.712 --> 02:39:31.752]  You looked so depressed.
[02:39:31.772 --> 02:39:32.412]  What's wrong, buddy?
[02:39:32.432 --> 02:39:34.252]  Oh, no, I'm good.
[02:39:34.352 --> 02:39:34.792]  I was having fun.
[02:39:34.812 --> 02:39:36.073]  Oh, you were having fun?
[02:39:36.093 --> 02:39:37.293]  Well, then come back on.
[02:39:37.313 --> 02:39:38.713]  Well, hold on.
[02:39:38.733 --> 02:39:39.393]  I've got to redress.
[02:39:39.473 --> 02:39:40.053]  Are they in there?
[02:39:40.093 --> 02:39:43.174]  I thought they were shooting a video right now because you wanted them to do a report on something.
[02:39:43.933 --> 02:39:44.433]  Well, no, no.
[02:39:44.954 --> 02:39:47.136]  I was saying, go do a report or stay on with us.
[02:39:47.156 --> 02:39:49.437]  I just want to make you sit there while we're doing all this.
[02:39:49.457 --> 02:39:51.019]  Oh, I'm good.
[02:39:51.119 --> 02:39:53.000]  Dude, Megyn Kelly does look like a tranny now.
[02:39:53.261 --> 02:39:53.981]  I'm not lying.
[02:39:54.942 --> 02:39:56.063]  Hey, I'm not kidding.
[02:39:56.103 --> 02:39:56.443]  No, no.
[02:39:56.463 --> 02:39:57.304]  She's on screen.
[02:39:57.324 --> 02:40:02.428]  Dude, if the TV puts 20 pounds on you, she looks really emaciated.
[02:40:02.728 --> 02:40:03.609]  Is she anorexic?
[02:40:03.909 --> 02:40:04.530]  She's not a tranny.
[02:40:04.730 --> 02:40:05.530]  She's a beautiful woman.
[02:40:05.550 --> 02:40:06.251]  I don't like her.
[02:40:06.271 --> 02:40:06.932]  I don't like her.
[02:40:10.239 --> 02:40:12.200]  That's right, you've been on her show, I forgot that.
[02:40:12.440 --> 02:40:23.726]  Let's get you, I want to talk about her right now, and I apologize, I wasn't trying to get you guys off, I just wanted to make Knight sit there while I was babbling, and then, but then Lee Yankee's pointing out that you should come back on the show should Knight, I apologize.
[02:40:24.387 --> 02:40:29.350]  And listen, if you're a Persian cat, I'm whatever's the biggest, fattest cat type there is.
[02:40:31.851 --> 02:40:34.312]  I love this country, it's awesome.
[02:40:34.532 --> 02:40:37.494]  Anyway, it's alright, it's teleprompter free.
[02:40:37.514 --> 02:40:38.955]  Now you've not had any beer now, right?
[02:40:41.323 --> 02:40:41.983]  Okay, okay.
[02:40:42.304 --> 02:40:48.307]  We're going to get you on the board via phone call or go back over, even if Knight is in his onesie.
[02:40:48.767 --> 02:40:50.108]  Let's just get this going, okay?
[02:40:50.128 --> 02:40:51.809]  Alright, let's do this.
[02:40:51.829 --> 02:40:52.950]  Alright, here you go.
[02:40:53.010 --> 02:40:54.170]  We're going to go over five hours.
[02:40:54.190 --> 02:40:56.492]  In fact, I'm going to leave and just let you guys take over.
[02:40:56.512 --> 02:40:57.272]  I'm going to watch and listen.
[02:40:57.552 --> 02:40:59.914]  You know why I usually don't come on the debate?
[02:40:59.934 --> 02:41:00.934]  Because quite frankly, I do.
[02:41:01.354 --> 02:41:03.616]  It's because I know I'm obnoxious and I take over, eh?
[02:41:04.727 --> 02:41:06.929]  B, I'm already on the air all the time in burnout.
[02:41:07.589 --> 02:41:17.716]  And then C, I really enjoy at my house with a TV I can roll into my bedroom and then in the mainstream debate, watch you guys.
[02:41:17.816 --> 02:41:18.497]  It looks better.
[02:41:18.817 --> 02:41:19.537]  It sounds better.
[02:41:19.818 --> 02:41:21.038]  The stuff you say is better.
[02:41:21.058 --> 02:41:22.319]  I'm like, it makes me feel good.
[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:27.763]  Because I'm thinking, man, why don't I shut up and let them talk more when they're actually on my show?
[02:41:27.783 --> 02:41:28.564]  Because they're really smart.
[02:41:29.372 --> 02:41:34.762]  So that's why I may leave and just let you guys take over, even though it's been a good transmission.
[02:41:35.162 --> 02:41:38.388]  Because that's the mark of a... We have Kit Daniels.
[02:41:38.408 --> 02:41:39.911]  Sorry, jump in any time, McBrain.
[02:41:40.912 --> 02:41:41.974]  Sorry, go ahead, Kit Daniels.
[02:41:42.824 --> 02:41:43.004]  This is
[02:41:59.936 --> 02:42:03.559]  It's an enemy invader from the Galileo Space Fleet.
[02:42:03.579 --> 02:42:04.840]  People are sick of political correctness.
[02:42:05.041 --> 02:42:05.881]  I hate racism.
[02:42:06.182 --> 02:42:10.085]  I grew up my parents being fiscally conservative, but very liberal about being against racism.
[02:42:10.525 --> 02:42:14.088]  So I was drilled, you know, this guilt stuff, which is okay, backed in.
[02:42:14.428 --> 02:42:15.649]  But now I haven't done anything.
[02:42:15.669 --> 02:42:16.570]  I don't need to be guilted.
[02:42:16.850 --> 02:42:20.133]  So kind of when I hear politically incorrect stuff, I kind of like it, because I'm sick of it!
[02:42:20.473 --> 02:42:21.194]  People are saying that.
[02:42:21.234 --> 02:42:21.694]  Does that make sense?
[02:42:21.895 --> 02:42:22.075]  Yes.
[02:42:22.495 --> 02:42:24.837]  People are trying to claim that Trump is scared of Megyn Kelly.
[02:42:24.857 --> 02:42:26.037]  That's why he didn't go to the debate.
[02:42:26.178 --> 02:42:26.358]  Right.
[02:42:26.478 --> 02:42:28.639]  But Trump has read The Art of War.
[02:42:29.140 --> 02:42:31.521]  I think he even wrote a book called The Art of the Deal.
[02:42:31.601 --> 02:42:35.384]  I mean, personal story, you know, if I go on Craigslist, I want to look at a pickup truck for sale.
[02:42:35.764 --> 02:42:36.805]  I go out there and look at it.
[02:42:36.885 --> 02:42:40.367]  It's not the pickup truck I want or I think it's not a good deal.
[02:42:40.487 --> 02:42:41.168]  I walk away.
[02:42:41.248 --> 02:42:42.028]  Same thing with Trump.
[02:42:42.288 --> 02:42:43.729]  He just walked away from this debate.
[02:42:43.789 --> 02:42:44.830]  He had nothing to gain from it.
[02:42:44.850 --> 02:42:49.033]  He shouldn't just fall down in front of the globalist, prostitute media.
[02:42:49.133 --> 02:42:49.773]  Excellent point.
[02:42:50.154 --> 02:42:52.035]  Kim, we're coming back to you, but Jakari, that's a good point.
[02:42:52.475 --> 02:42:55.640]  I mean, here, what has this debate crystallized?
[02:42:55.680 --> 02:42:58.524]  What has this whole fiasco boiled down to?
[02:42:58.564 --> 02:43:03.070]  Jakari Jackson, let's see you get angry, like you get angry at me when I'm being a jerk around the office.
[02:43:03.451 --> 02:43:07.997]  Let's see the real, or those abortionists were trying to attack me and you stood up for me and protected me.
[02:43:08.963 --> 02:43:10.844]  And I fell down and rolled on the ground like the beetle.
[02:43:11.184 --> 02:43:13.825]  Now, now, go back to that, the guy climbed the trash can, literally.
[02:43:13.885 --> 02:43:15.005]  He did, he did.
[02:43:15.025 --> 02:43:16.666]  He did crawl in the trash can, he had green skin.
[02:43:16.686 --> 02:43:17.466]  It's like slow motion.
[02:43:17.506 --> 02:43:20.027]  Jakari, what is your view of this and what he just said?
[02:43:20.047 --> 02:43:21.627]  Because I think Trump's had a devastating victory.
[02:43:21.947 --> 02:43:29.470]  Yeah, I think it does, it helps crystallize that you don't have to fall into the mainstream stratosphere to get your message across.
[02:43:29.490 --> 02:43:35.912]  So I think if nothing else, all future politicians can learn from the example of Trump and Rand Paul in these past two debates.
[02:43:36.292 --> 02:43:38.693]  As far as the whole Meg and Karen Kelly deal, it's never my deal.
[02:43:38.953 --> 02:43:42.295]  I'm not the biggest fan of her, but I don't hate her like, you know, the scum of the earth either.
[02:43:42.315 --> 02:43:44.676]  It's really not an issue to me altogether.
[02:43:44.836 --> 02:43:47.817]  I'm not against trannies.
[02:43:48.838 --> 02:43:53.860]  But as far as that... That's good that that's on the record, by the way.
[02:43:53.940 --> 02:43:54.940]  I'm not against trannies.
[02:43:54.960 --> 02:43:56.161]  I think this one's a little too skinny.
[02:43:57.661 --> 02:43:58.382]  I'm getting serious.
[02:43:58.402 --> 02:43:58.982]  I apologize.
[02:43:59.002 --> 02:44:00.042]  And that's not right, folks.
[02:44:00.243 --> 02:44:00.903]  That's not right!
[02:44:01.971 --> 02:44:02.631]  Purple penguin.
[02:44:02.951 --> 02:44:03.672]  Purple penguin.
[02:44:03.692 --> 02:44:04.732]  Purple penguin.
[02:44:04.772 --> 02:44:05.292]  Exactly.
[02:44:05.432 --> 02:44:06.713]  She is a purple penguin.
[02:44:07.653 --> 02:44:11.154]  Jakari, should we have her announce she's a purple penguin?
[02:44:11.354 --> 02:44:12.674]  If everybody is a purple penguin.
[02:44:12.714 --> 02:44:15.895]  Wow, that is quite the screen wrap.
[02:44:17.276 --> 02:44:17.896]  Purple penguin?
[02:44:17.916 --> 02:44:18.716]  Hey, why not?
[02:44:19.857 --> 02:44:21.337]  It's the most politically correct term.
[02:44:21.357 --> 02:44:21.857]  Oh my goodness.
[02:44:21.877 --> 02:44:23.138]  Put it on the screen.
[02:44:23.638 --> 02:44:24.438]  Purple penguin, Doug.
[02:44:24.518 --> 02:44:25.519]  Extreme close-up.
[02:44:27.386 --> 02:44:28.606]  Let's get serious here.
[02:44:28.626 --> 02:44:30.487]  Let's go back to Kit Daniels.
[02:44:30.987 --> 02:44:32.008]  Let's go to Kit Daniels.
[02:44:32.028 --> 02:44:35.889]  You're on the air with Leigh-Anne McAdoo, also known as Wonder Woman.
[02:44:36.089 --> 02:44:42.952]  I think what really crystallized this whole thing was last night when Bill O'Reilly was begging Donald Trump to come to the debate.
[02:44:42.992 --> 02:44:44.152]  You owe me milkshakes.
[02:44:44.672 --> 02:44:45.593]  They're so desperate.
[02:44:46.653 --> 02:44:52.137]  The most bizarre thing I've ever heard from Bill O'Reilly, and this is the kind of guy that's usually trying to attack people left and right.
[02:44:52.157 --> 02:44:52.858]  And I agree!
[02:44:53.298 --> 02:45:02.565]  That photo of them slurping milkshakes together, two men, like, white liquids, straws, I did not like, I'm honest, it was creepy.
[02:45:02.985 --> 02:45:05.647]  And I kind of, Donald Trump, like, went from like 95% support,
[02:45:10.014 --> 02:45:11.134]  Yeah, I really wish I was in a yard.
[02:45:39.548 --> 02:45:41.349]  They're having pistachio milkshakes, they're pretty damn good.
[02:45:41.369 --> 02:45:42.390]  That's a Martian milkshake.
[02:45:43.130 --> 02:45:45.491]  Anyways, let's get back to what I was saying.
[02:45:45.991 --> 02:45:47.552]  Go ahead.
[02:45:47.612 --> 02:45:52.575]  It's funny, we're joking about it, but meanwhile at the Fox News headquarters, they're probably all freaking out.
[02:45:52.795 --> 02:45:55.657]  Meanwhile, I bet Jeb Bush has had some vanilla milkshakes.
[02:45:55.797 --> 02:45:57.638]  Yeah, I bet.
[02:45:57.678 --> 02:46:00.820]  I mean, Fox News, they have to be freaking out right now.
[02:46:00.920 --> 02:46:07.663]  I'm sure they're looking at their preliminary numbers on how many people are watching the debate.
[02:46:07.723 --> 02:46:08.744]  It's probably an admissal.
[02:46:09.875 --> 02:46:10.395]  No, poor.
[02:46:10.536 --> 02:46:11.817]  I don't know if I pronounced that correctly.
[02:46:11.837 --> 02:46:12.257]  Abysmal?
[02:46:12.537 --> 02:46:13.178]  Yeah, abysmal.
[02:46:13.818 --> 02:46:17.561]  So, yeah, I mean, this is kind of, what we're seeing right now is historic.
[02:46:17.581 --> 02:46:18.862]  This is the cracks.
[02:46:19.243 --> 02:46:20.724]  It's kind of like the Cracks of Liberty Bill.
[02:46:20.744 --> 02:46:22.866]  This is the cracks the establishment's always been fearing.
[02:46:22.886 --> 02:46:24.327]  I agree.
[02:46:24.347 --> 02:46:32.073]  Listen, it was like a major defeat when CNBC, all of them turned against us and said, you're a joke, and they went from being arrogant to groveling.
[02:46:33.054 --> 02:46:35.696]  To now, this is like a Death Star blowing up.
[02:46:36.237 --> 02:46:37.398]  We have to celebrate.
[02:46:40.599 --> 02:46:44.380]  They're all trumpeting out and they're all saying, oh this is a mistake, oh it was going to be terrible.
[02:46:44.700 --> 02:46:47.741]  So now they're like, he didn't win, it's a mistake.
[02:46:48.142 --> 02:46:49.802]  How are they going to boost up their ratings?
[02:46:49.822 --> 02:46:52.383]  They don't get that they're losing the narrative and they're just a bunch of idiots.
[02:46:52.783 --> 02:46:55.444]  Jakari, you started working here three and a half years ago.
[02:46:55.745 --> 02:46:56.745]  I want your honest opinion.
[02:46:56.765 --> 02:46:57.445]  I know you're always honest.
[02:46:57.805 --> 02:46:59.346]  Has this been better or worse than you thought?
[02:46:59.366 --> 02:47:00.266]  Is it what you thought it would be?
[02:47:00.306 --> 02:47:00.886]  Did we deliver?
[02:47:01.147 --> 02:47:01.867]  Or is it insane?
[02:47:02.498 --> 02:47:03.659]  Oh, it definitely is insane.
[02:47:04.399 --> 02:47:05.199]  It is insane.
[02:47:05.439 --> 02:47:08.701]  It's a lot more hard-hitting than I originally anticipated.
[02:47:09.882 --> 02:47:16.105]  But yeah, it's been definitely a wild ride to see all the things that have happened in just the short time that I've been here.
[02:47:18.966 --> 02:47:20.707]  You were good on air before as a reporter.
[02:47:20.727 --> 02:47:22.348]  You've gotten really good live, really good.
[02:47:22.648 --> 02:47:23.528]  You're always smart.
[02:47:23.909 --> 02:47:24.449]  Same with Liam.
[02:47:25.399 --> 02:47:28.980]  Little, little, I forgot we had Richard Reeves, he might have gotten a Donald Trump question in.
[02:47:29.280 --> 02:47:30.000]  Yes, let's do it.
[02:47:30.100 --> 02:47:37.643]  Richard Reeves, Infowars.com reporter in Iowa, there joining us via video Skype for all the viewers and radio listeners out there.
[02:47:38.403 --> 02:47:39.883]  Richard Reeves, thank you my friend.
[02:47:40.783 --> 02:47:51.446]  Yes sir, thank you Alex, this is Richard Reeves with Infowars.com and unfortunately I didn't get to ask Donald Trump any questions, but we have Chris Cook here, one of the attendees of the Veterans Trump event.
[02:47:51.466 --> 02:47:52.967]  Well God bless him, let's talk to him.
[02:47:54.166 --> 02:47:54.747]  Hello, Alex.
[02:47:54.967 --> 02:47:55.908]  It's a pleasure to meet you.
[02:47:56.128 --> 02:47:56.808]  Nice meeting you, brother.
[02:47:56.848 --> 02:47:57.148]  Go ahead.
[02:47:57.188 --> 02:47:58.129]  Tell us why you're there today.
[02:47:58.149 --> 02:48:00.250]  We had a really good time here today.
[02:48:00.290 --> 02:48:11.698]  We got to put politics aside and got to help some veterans that really need the help because the system as it sits now is not helping.
[02:48:11.858 --> 02:48:19.363]  We're pumping these kids full of drugs and denying them care that they need and people dying on lists.
[02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:29.709]  You know, it's folks like you that are getting the word out that the average Joe Six Pack veteran, we really appreciate that.
[02:48:31.049 --> 02:48:38.133]  Well, now, you know, you make me feel guilty, because I'm... Brother, I don't know if he can hear me, but... No, he can't hear you, Alex, but I'll repeat your question.
[02:48:38.413 --> 02:48:44.116]  Well, he humbles me, because we're kind of having fun here tonight, excited about Trump, but I like what Trump said.
[02:48:44.156 --> 02:48:45.577]  I watched most of it, but I missed it.
[02:48:46.197 --> 02:48:47.838]  I tell him I love what Trump did.
[02:48:47.858 --> 02:48:58.804]  I like to focus on veterans, but thank God he brought up the denial of care, because he hoped Trump gets really aggressive with the denial of care issue and the computers that decide to put him on death list.
[02:48:59.404 --> 02:48:59.624]  Okay.
[02:48:59.965 --> 02:49:05.509]  Well, Chris, Alex hopes that Trump really gets aggressive with the denial of care and getting veterans the treatment they need.
[02:49:06.549 --> 02:49:09.712]  And so Alex really, really wants that to happen.
[02:49:09.792 --> 02:49:12.474]  And do we think Mr. Trump wants that as well?
[02:49:15.109 --> 02:49:21.451]  Honestly, I don't know, but we can't keep on going to the usual suspects.
[02:49:22.671 --> 02:49:26.612]  The definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results.
[02:49:27.653 --> 02:49:29.573]  And you know what?
[02:49:30.713 --> 02:49:39.236]  Donald Trump is saying the things that most of us have been screaming at the TV for the past 8, 16, 20 years.
[02:49:40.436 --> 02:49:43.457]  And there's nothing better.
[02:49:44.748 --> 02:49:51.491]  And I do have a feeling that deep down inside, because this man's taking a pay cut for this job.
[02:49:51.531 --> 02:49:51.751]  I agree.
[02:49:51.771 --> 02:49:52.631]  I have a feeling he's good.
[02:49:52.671 --> 02:49:56.713]  You know, that's always the big joke when people ask a businessman, are you going to run for president?
[02:49:56.753 --> 02:49:59.374]  And they always joke and say, I can't afford the pay cut.
[02:49:59.394 --> 02:50:00.895]  I'm going with my gut, I'm telling you.
[02:50:00.935 --> 02:50:02.135]  I don't think he did.
[02:50:02.995 --> 02:50:04.316]  Alex says he's going with his gut.
[02:50:04.356 --> 02:50:05.656]  What is your gut telling you, Chris?
[02:50:07.157 --> 02:50:11.539]  I've seen him talk twice now, and my gut feels very good about him.
[02:50:12.526 --> 02:50:13.347]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:50:13.447 --> 02:50:14.969]  I didn't want to feel good about him.
[02:50:15.069 --> 02:50:16.250]  Oh yeah, that's it.
[02:50:16.590 --> 02:50:18.212]  Good men like Alex.
[02:50:18.232 --> 02:50:29.203]  Tell him that I didn't want to intellectually go with him because he's this brash guy and this caricature, but my gut the whole time has been, this is big, it's happening, and my gut is more sure than ever.
[02:50:29.724 --> 02:50:30.925]  And my gut's never been wrong.
[02:50:30.985 --> 02:50:31.726]  I'm going with my gut.
[02:50:31.786 --> 02:50:32.747]  I'm backing Donald Trump.
[02:50:34.016 --> 02:50:48.534]  Chris, Alex said at first that Donald Trump's brashness kind of rubbed him the wrong way, but as more time went by, his gut initially even told him that Trump is the man, and just as these few months have gone by, these last eight or nine months have gone by, Alex's gut has gotten even stronger about Trump.
[02:50:49.475 --> 02:50:51.397]  You know what, I have to agree with you on that.
[02:50:52.998 --> 02:50:56.401]  Being brash is something that us veterans understand.
[02:50:56.421 --> 02:51:08.211]  I think that's a very important part of why our military is so good, is because our young men and women out there are brash.
[02:51:08.371 --> 02:51:13.475]  They have an incredible set of huevos, even if they don't come with them originally.
[02:51:14.484 --> 02:51:19.109]  And, uh, but we always gotta remember that we gotta hold their feet to the fire.
[02:51:19.709 --> 02:51:28.958]  I voted for a certain senator here in Iowa that said she was for the veterans, and when I went to her for help with the VA, I got bupkis.
[02:51:29.959 --> 02:51:30.220]  So...
[02:51:31.670 --> 02:51:32.090]  That's right.
[02:51:32.110 --> 02:51:33.852]  Well, we need to get the veterans to the fire.
[02:51:33.872 --> 02:51:34.712]  Hold their feet to the fire.
[02:51:34.732 --> 02:51:37.174]  We need to get the veterans, the veterans are the ones that need national health care.
[02:51:37.194 --> 02:51:39.015]  If you'll see any doctors, they damn well please.
[02:51:39.035 --> 02:51:39.656]  Right, exactly.
[02:51:39.736 --> 02:51:41.797]  And they use the VA to prey on our veterans.
[02:51:41.817 --> 02:51:44.199]  And to be clear, when I said brash, that's not the right word.
[02:51:44.920 --> 02:51:48.702]  Just his whole history, things he's done, kind of, you know, liberal, whatever.
[02:51:49.703 --> 02:51:55.007]  But now, it's clear, it's the Bilderberg, the Bilderberg group's against him, I'm for him.
[02:51:55.868 --> 02:52:17.973]  Yep, and Alex, earlier I actually did record Chris Cook here, and I had some more footage to upload later, but one of the things he told me, and I want him to tell me again right now, is about how that there's literally billions of dollars being spent to build military hospitals, medical facilities, etc., but it just doesn't get to the veterans down at the ones that need them.
[02:52:18.013 --> 02:52:18.353]  Oh, that's right.
[02:52:18.373 --> 02:52:19.233]  Tell us more about that, Chris.
[02:52:19.313 --> 02:52:20.333]  It's like 1% of the funding goes
[02:52:21.174 --> 02:52:30.400]  I've been all over the place and I've seen a few veterans hospitals, but I have never seen a veterans hospital where there's not a major construction project going on.
[02:52:31.160 --> 02:52:38.205]  At Long Beach Hospital, they tore down a perfectly good building and built another one in its place.
[02:52:38.725 --> 02:52:40.466]  And you know, I challenge your audience.
[02:52:40.747 --> 02:52:45.510]  Go and try and find us a picture of a VA hospital where there isn't major construction.
[02:52:45.630 --> 02:52:47.431]  I'll bet you we can't find one.
[02:52:48.011 --> 02:52:49.833]  All this money that goes into the VA
[02:52:50.913 --> 02:52:59.536]  Um, all it's going to do is go into the construction companies owned by people who paid money into the right campaigns.
[02:52:59.616 --> 02:52:59.976]  That's it.
[02:53:00.376 --> 02:53:00.876]  Wow.
[02:53:01.077 --> 02:53:02.277]  And that's what Trump says will stop.
[02:53:02.297 --> 02:53:05.018]  It's not getting down to these young kids that we're sending over.
[02:53:05.973 --> 02:53:07.915]  To get killed and maimed and... Right.
[02:53:08.815 --> 02:53:10.036]  You know, I'm 50 years old.
[02:53:10.076 --> 02:53:12.178]  If I die tomorrow, I've had a great life.
[02:53:12.779 --> 02:53:20.145]  But I see these kids just starting out and dealing with medical problems that I've got and... Well, let's go back.
[02:53:20.165 --> 02:53:21.026]  It just brings me to tears.
[02:53:21.086 --> 02:53:22.967]  Ask him for his personal message to Trump.
[02:53:23.007 --> 02:53:24.208]  I've got a feeling Trump will see this.
[02:53:24.569 --> 02:53:26.190]  Ask him to give his personal message to Trump.
[02:53:26.230 --> 02:53:28.192]  Then I want Jakari and Leigh-Anne to ask a question.
[02:53:28.892 --> 02:53:29.492]  Okay, Chris.
[02:53:29.893 --> 02:53:33.995]  Chris, Alex thinks that your personal message to Trump would be seen by Trump.
[02:53:34.055 --> 02:53:36.056]  So what would you like to tell Mr. Trump right now?
[02:53:37.537 --> 02:53:42.860]  As bad as the VA hospital system is, you need to look into the VA pension system.
[02:53:43.561 --> 02:53:46.903]  There are injured veterans like my wife.
[02:53:47.833 --> 02:53:51.794]  Her lower back was destroyed while she was on active duty.
[02:53:52.514 --> 02:53:54.295]  She went through all the proper steps.
[02:53:54.835 --> 02:54:00.976]  She got all the paperwork she was supposed to get so she could get boarded out by the... She was in the Army Reserve.
[02:54:00.996 --> 02:54:03.377]  She was on orders at the time.
[02:54:03.517 --> 02:54:04.477]  She blew her back out.
[02:54:04.837 --> 02:54:06.318]  She was working for Uncle Sam.
[02:54:07.318 --> 02:54:11.739]  And they ended up sliding her out the back door while she was waiting for her medical board.
[02:54:12.719 --> 02:54:16.060]  She called up to ask what was going on and they said, oh, you were discharged last month.
[02:54:17.395 --> 02:54:20.057]  And the VA won't touch her because she's never had a medical board.
[02:54:20.197 --> 02:54:23.440]  And the Army won't give her a medical board now because she's been discharged.
[02:54:24.220 --> 02:54:28.443]  The woman wakes up in the morning in agony with her back.
[02:54:28.703 --> 02:54:32.686]  She can't do the jobs that she was trained to do.
[02:54:32.787 --> 02:54:34.728]  She's an incredibly talented woman.
[02:54:35.328 --> 02:54:37.630]  And the strongest woman I've ever known.
[02:54:37.650 --> 02:54:42.554]  She's carried me through losing my leg and has taken care of me since 2003.
[02:54:44.745 --> 02:54:48.606]  And any of you that know amputees, that doesn't happen.
[02:54:48.626 --> 02:54:51.886]  99.9% of amputees lose their better halves.
[02:54:52.147 --> 02:54:53.007]  Wow, alright.
[02:54:53.307 --> 02:54:58.268]  And she, even more than me, deserves it.
[02:54:58.368 --> 02:55:04.749]  She was broken on active duty, but they won't touch her because she's a reservist.
[02:55:05.409 --> 02:55:10.810]  Alright, well tell him God bless you, and ask him if he's got any contact info for viewers or folks out there.
[02:55:10.830 --> 02:55:12.811]  Because I'm going to pass the government helping folks.
[02:55:12.851 --> 02:55:14.331]  We can see if folks want to get in contact with him.
[02:55:14.631 --> 02:55:17.453]  Right, like Vic said, help them directly if we want to donate.
[02:55:17.513 --> 02:55:26.400]  Chris, Alex says God bless you and that if you've got a website or a blog or contact information you'd like to put out there that hopefully folks could help you personally.
[02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:29.362]  Um, I guess you could see my Twitter feed.
[02:55:30.003 --> 02:55:32.304]  It's at Grumpy Ol' Jarhead.
[02:55:32.324 --> 02:55:35.767]  O-L and Jarhead.
[02:55:36.147 --> 02:55:38.569]  Grumpy Ol' Jarhead on Twitter.
[02:55:40.026 --> 02:55:41.628]  So, and God bless you, Alex.
[02:55:41.808 --> 02:55:42.568]  God bless you, brother.
[02:55:42.588 --> 02:55:43.810]  Keep their feet to the fire.
[02:55:44.290 --> 02:55:44.570]  We're trying.
[02:55:44.590 --> 02:55:46.832]  We've even got to keep the good ones honest.
[02:55:47.193 --> 02:55:47.673]  Right.
[02:55:47.773 --> 02:55:49.014]  And that's what your job is.
[02:55:49.034 --> 02:55:49.415]  Right.
[02:55:49.435 --> 02:55:50.275]  And God bless you again.
[02:55:50.315 --> 02:55:50.656]  Thank you.
[02:55:50.776 --> 02:55:51.136]  That's true.
[02:55:51.156 --> 02:55:52.958]  We've got to drive the good guys to take action.
[02:55:52.978 --> 02:55:53.678]  That's what it's all about.
[02:55:53.718 --> 02:55:55.480]  That's what I do around here, and you do to me, too.
[02:55:55.520 --> 02:55:56.801]  We really need to do more.
[02:55:56.821 --> 02:55:57.342]  This is real.
[02:55:58.137 --> 02:55:58.937]  Good job, Richard.
[02:55:58.977 --> 02:56:00.177]  I want to come back to you.
[02:56:00.277 --> 02:56:06.399]  You can go schoon around, get a new position, find some folks you want to talk to, tell folks to line up if they want to be on international media.
[02:56:06.419 --> 02:56:08.279]  We're going to come back to you in about 10 minutes.
[02:56:08.319 --> 02:56:16.161]  I'm going to talk to Jakari, Leigh-Anne, and more with Kit Daniels, more with McBreen, and then we're not covering Chris Christie.
[02:56:16.201 --> 02:56:17.861]  And we've already seen eight of these debates.
[02:56:18.321 --> 02:56:19.301]  Trump did something different.
[02:56:19.321 --> 02:56:22.142]  We're going to go back to Joe Biggs here briefly via phone.
[02:56:23.402 --> 02:56:24.123]  There you go, Joe.
[02:56:24.743 --> 02:56:34.810]  Joe, you look very upset during the coverage earlier, and so tell us what's going on, and then overall, getting to see the aftermath of the debate, where Joe Biggs is right now.
[02:56:36.270 --> 02:56:37.251]  I'm not upset at all.
[02:56:37.291 --> 02:56:40.073]  Joe Biggs is completely and totally always dope.
[02:56:40.613 --> 02:56:41.494]  Who is that guy?
[02:56:41.554 --> 02:56:42.574]  Who is that guy on TV?
[02:56:42.614 --> 02:56:43.715]  He doesn't look like Taliban.
[02:56:43.775 --> 02:56:44.656]  That's Baby Biggs.
[02:56:45.116 --> 02:56:46.997]  That's Baby Biggs without the damn beard?
[02:56:47.017 --> 02:56:48.138]  That's little Baby Biggs.
[02:56:48.498 --> 02:56:49.979]  That's pre-InfoWars Biggs.
[02:56:51.547 --> 02:56:53.029]  That's pre-InfoWars, Biggs.
[02:56:53.069 --> 02:56:56.493]  Biggs, separately with all the viewers out there, let's not talk about the debate and stuff.
[02:56:56.573 --> 02:56:57.734]  What do you think of InfoWars?
[02:56:57.754 --> 02:57:01.318]  Because, you know, I never tell people I'm going to do this, but I want to know your real view of InfoWars.
[02:57:01.858 --> 02:57:03.821]  You got a boss that calls you a grumpy cat on TV.
[02:57:06.315 --> 02:57:08.137]  Why am I a grumpy cat?
[02:57:08.177 --> 02:57:09.258]  I was in a hot room.
[02:57:10.259 --> 02:57:14.563]  That's my body's natural reaction to being in 100 degree weather inside of a hotel room.
[02:57:14.783 --> 02:57:15.424]  I agree with that.
[02:57:15.464 --> 02:57:16.405]  Do I keep this place cold?
[02:57:16.425 --> 02:57:17.486]  It is ice cold.
[02:57:17.506 --> 02:57:18.387]  Freezing cold.
[02:57:18.727 --> 02:57:19.748]  Biggs is a good American.
[02:57:19.768 --> 02:57:21.129]  He's the only one not complaining about it.
[02:57:21.210 --> 02:57:23.632]  That is my least favorite thing about working at Infowars.
[02:57:23.952 --> 02:57:24.453]  The 57 degrees.
[02:57:27.343 --> 02:57:29.905]  That's one of the top five favorite things.
[02:57:29.945 --> 02:57:31.166]  There's like an iceberg in there.
[02:57:31.186 --> 02:57:32.627]  I love it.
[02:57:32.867 --> 02:57:33.627]  It's all dark.
[02:57:33.807 --> 02:57:34.908]  There's weapons everywhere.
[02:57:34.928 --> 02:57:38.390]  If people actually saw what was going on here... Oh my goodness.
[02:57:38.551 --> 02:57:39.451]  Look, there he is!
[02:57:39.591 --> 02:57:41.352]  I've got like a Mossberg shotgun.
[02:57:41.412 --> 02:57:42.773]  I've got an assault rifle.
[02:57:42.793 --> 02:57:47.096]  I've got a fire-breathing shotgun around.
[02:57:47.116 --> 02:57:51.619]  Everybody's got heaters at their desk and I'm just like... I'm sorry, I get hot.
[02:57:51.739 --> 02:57:54.141]  You're like, ugh, everyone's lizards around here.
[02:57:56.567 --> 02:57:58.089]  I've got a fan on high.
[02:57:59.590 --> 02:58:01.312]  Biggs, why do you think they love living in heat?
[02:58:01.512 --> 02:58:02.113]  What's wrong with them?
[02:58:03.114 --> 02:58:03.534]  I don't know.
[02:58:04.435 --> 02:58:04.976]  I don't get it.
[02:58:05.236 --> 02:58:06.718]  I understand women, why they do.
[02:58:07.458 --> 02:58:09.781]  Joe Biggs, you look good on screen.
[02:58:09.961 --> 02:58:10.682]  I expect it.
[02:58:10.702 --> 02:58:12.904]  Alright, let's get serious.
[02:58:13.525 --> 02:58:14.686]  Awesome, Joe Biggs.
[02:58:16.032 --> 02:58:17.033]  I heard you say trainees earlier.
[02:58:17.053 --> 02:58:19.575]  Were you talking about Megyn Kelly?
[02:58:19.595 --> 02:58:23.518]  I just wanted to make sure that's what you guys were referring to because she's definitely an evil human being at times.
[02:58:37.355 --> 02:58:48.482]  I mean, the fact that she would go in and make fun of the fact that Michael Hastings had just died, and anybody who questioned it... Phil, folks said on Michael Hastings that we got like millions of people listening, tens of thousands watching.
[02:58:48.962 --> 02:58:50.923]  It's funny we're like video, but we're mainly audio.
[02:58:50.963 --> 02:58:51.784]  Bring us back in time a little bit.
[02:58:51.804 --> 02:58:56.446]  Explain about what happened a few years ago to Michael Hastings when his car went and turned into a Roman candle in L.A.
[02:58:56.466 --> 02:59:01.429]  Alright, so Michael Hastings is a big-time war correspondent.
[02:59:01.449 --> 02:59:05.091]  He embedded with military units in Iraq, Afghanistan.
[02:59:05.131 --> 02:59:05.872]  He lost his wife.
[02:59:06.468 --> 02:59:07.328]  We're good to go.
[02:59:28.969 --> 02:59:40.676]  And, uh, him and I became really good friends over there, and I had respect for him, because most journalists run and whimper away and cower whenever, uh, you know, stuff hit the fan, and, uh, we were getting attacked.
[02:59:41.397 --> 02:59:44.959]  Uh, Michael Hastings, on the other hand, was a brave, unique soul.
[02:59:45.439 --> 02:59:47.120]  The guy, uh, loved what he did.
[02:59:47.140 --> 02:59:48.241]  He loved being a journalist.
[02:59:48.261 --> 02:59:49.582]  He loved, uh, exposing.
[02:59:49.742 --> 02:59:56.006]  And you openly said you thought he might be CIA or something, because you were in, like, insane battles where other, even troops were freaking out.
[02:59:56.306 --> 02:59:57.487]  You said he was hardcore, right?
[02:59:58.328 --> 02:59:59.769]  Oh, that guy was extremely hardcore.
[02:59:59.829 --> 03:00:01.370]  I mean, he was badass.
[03:00:01.410 --> 03:00:01.970]  He was awesome.
[03:00:02.050 --> 03:00:08.514]  I mean, the fact that he could keep composure and sit there and work through that and not flip out was just amazing.
[03:00:08.554 --> 03:00:09.875]  And that's one of the things I loved about him.
[03:00:10.455 --> 03:00:15.218]  And then, you know, years down the road, you know, we've stayed in contact over the years.
[03:00:15.278 --> 03:00:16.639]  He writes a book, puts me in it.
[03:00:16.659 --> 03:00:21.282]  Did a whole Dan Rather's hour-long special with me in it.
[03:00:22.243 --> 03:00:24.524]  Wrote about me and GQ and some other stuff.
[03:00:24.544 --> 03:00:26.005]  So him and I had a really good friendship.
[03:00:26.585 --> 03:00:32.429]  And then, uh, he sends me this, you know, really random, panicked email out of nowhere that is, was just very unlike him.
[03:00:56.485 --> 03:00:58.887]  What do you think he had learned?
[03:00:58.907 --> 03:00:59.748]  We still don't know.
[03:00:59.768 --> 03:01:02.169]  Well, there's a number of things.
[03:01:02.209 --> 03:01:07.573]  You know, Michael Hastings was one of those guys who was working on not just one big story, he was working on a number of things.
[03:01:08.214 --> 03:01:13.037]  And one of the things he was working on was a thing on John Brennan, from what I've heard.
[03:01:13.738 --> 03:01:16.180]  John Brennan was given the task to
[03:01:18.857 --> 03:01:25.699]  I'm trying to remember the term, uh, whitewash or clean off Obama's passport, uh, the proof of where he's been and things like that.
[03:01:26.499 --> 03:01:27.860]  And, uh, he will be on that.
[03:01:27.900 --> 03:01:30.581]  He tells us that the NSA has a spouse, right?
[03:01:30.741 --> 03:01:31.001]  Yeah.
[03:01:31.861 --> 03:01:34.782]  And he was looking into a number of different things as well.
[03:01:35.742 --> 03:01:40.104]  And, uh, he had already been, you know, uh, threatened by General McChrystal and his crew.
[03:01:40.751 --> 03:01:44.954]  For writing the piece he did, uh, The Runaway General, or The Rogue General.
[03:01:52.652 --> 03:01:56.555]  A Marine Corps Captain, and he'd become a Colonel, but devoted to Captain.
[03:01:56.595 --> 03:01:58.416]  He was an African American guy up in Dallas.
[03:01:58.436 --> 03:02:02.319]  And this guy would call and thought he was nuts, and later learned who he was and thought, wow, Colonel Six.
[03:02:03.120 --> 03:02:07.242]  He was saying, we're about to bring down McChrystal, and by the way, you're going to see it.
[03:02:07.383 --> 03:02:10.285]  And then it came out months later, and he died the day it came out.
[03:02:11.181 --> 03:02:14.602]  So then I was talking to multiple people that have died around this McChrystal thing.
[03:02:15.102 --> 03:02:17.183]  And I was like, okay, McChrystal will give us some good stuff.
[03:02:17.203 --> 03:02:21.184]  He called the office, he let us in his ID and stuff, that he was this Marine Corps colonel.
[03:02:21.244 --> 03:02:22.224]  I remember when he used to call in.
[03:02:22.244 --> 03:02:22.564]  Remember?
[03:02:22.604 --> 03:02:23.345]  They killed that guy.
[03:02:23.485 --> 03:02:23.665]  Yeah.
[03:02:23.945 --> 03:02:26.546]  Well, you got to think, though, too.
[03:02:26.946 --> 03:02:29.526]  McChrystal was running the war in Afghanistan.
[03:02:29.566 --> 03:02:34.308]  So what is it about McChrystal that they, Colonel Six dies, Hastings blows up.
[03:02:34.328 --> 03:02:36.649]  We're going to go back to Richard in a minute, but I'm going to come back to you.
[03:02:36.669 --> 03:02:37.729]  But yeah, there was something bigger.
[03:02:38.493 --> 03:02:42.316]  Here's the thing though, you don't just get a general fired, that's his entire cabinet.
[03:02:42.796 --> 03:02:49.741]  When him rising to the ranks as general, he's had the same people by his side day in and day out for years and years on end.
[03:02:50.001 --> 03:02:52.023]  When he gets fired, it's not just him getting fired.
[03:02:52.503 --> 03:03:02.971]  There's other guys, there's other assets, there's other people who are other government agency entities that are attached to him that lose their jobs too, their livelihoods, they take that personal.
[03:03:03.669 --> 03:03:05.730]  Yeah, exactly, that's exactly what it is.
[03:03:06.170 --> 03:03:27.739]  So it's not one man going down, it's a whole bunch of people and you're going to have some in there that have the know-how how to kill, that have to know how to use drones, that have to know how to use explosives and do all these different tactics and you're going to get one guy out there who's going to get extremely butt hurt and get upset and maybe do something and all we know is there's a really good man who is no longer alive because he reported the truth and he was killed
[03:03:28.120 --> 03:03:29.541]  And now we segue to Megyn Kelly.
[03:03:29.561 --> 03:03:32.524]  We're going to come back to you and then our other reporters.
[03:03:33.245 --> 03:03:35.467]  But Megyn Kelly had you on others.
[03:03:35.487 --> 03:03:36.748]  They all made a big joke out of it.
[03:03:37.569 --> 03:03:41.573]  It looks like Justin Timberlake and Ellen met each other and put on earrings.
[03:03:42.794 --> 03:03:45.417]  So you agree with me that it may actually be Caitlyn Jenner's daughter?
[03:03:47.539 --> 03:03:48.540]  No, it's Bruce Jinder.
[03:03:50.148 --> 03:03:51.489]  All right, well we're having some fun here.
[03:03:51.509 --> 03:03:53.410]  We've got Richard Reeves with a bunch of veterans here.
[03:03:53.431 --> 03:03:54.731]  We're going to come back to you.
[03:03:54.752 --> 03:03:59.515]  We've got Leanne McAdoo, Jakari Jackson, myself, the whole great crew, who have been up here since like 10 a.m.
[03:03:59.535 --> 03:04:01.256]  this morning, busting their booties.
[03:04:01.677 --> 03:04:02.878]  I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:04:02.918 --> 03:04:04.639]  Central, with a live transmission.
[03:04:04.659 --> 03:04:08.522]  But it's already 10.05 Central, or 10.03 Central, right now.
[03:04:08.562 --> 03:04:18.650]  Let's go back to Iowa, at Drake University, and there with Donald Trump, really dominating, taking over the whole debate, Richard Reeves.
[03:04:19.707 --> 03:04:20.148]  Yes, sir.
[03:04:20.208 --> 03:04:20.789]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:04:20.809 --> 03:04:22.091]  This is Richard Reeves once again.
[03:04:22.271 --> 03:04:23.333]  And, sir, what is your name?
[03:04:23.794 --> 03:04:24.616]  Grant Gardner.
[03:04:25.377 --> 03:04:25.998]  Grant Gardner.
[03:04:26.038 --> 03:04:29.284]  Tell us, you were giving us some information about the coxswain.
[03:04:29.304 --> 03:04:32.369]  Tell us a little bit more about how coxswain works here in Iowa.
[03:04:34.198 --> 03:04:38.781]  The caucus is the elementary form of government.
[03:04:39.502 --> 03:04:43.684]  It's where everybody gets a chance to have their say so, if they want to.
[03:04:45.545 --> 03:04:51.409]  And just the process, some of it may sound like it's really complicated, but it's really quite simple.
[03:04:52.609 --> 03:04:56.412]  You sign in, make sure everybody's registered.
[03:04:57.540 --> 03:04:57.800]  Yeah.
[03:04:58.642 --> 03:05:04.810]  And so those rumors about that it's going to take hours and hours and hours, that's really something to try to discourage people from showing up.
[03:05:04.930 --> 03:05:06.492]  What does he make of Microsoft taking it over?
[03:05:06.572 --> 03:05:08.414]  Yeah, that's exactly what they're trying to do.
[03:05:10.532 --> 03:05:14.916]  I'm hoping in my caucus that we'll be able to be out of there within a dollar, dollar and a half.
[03:05:15.137 --> 03:05:16.478]  That's what's scary, Richard.
[03:05:16.558 --> 03:05:17.639]  It's usually really quick.
[03:05:17.959 --> 03:05:21.783]  Now they're claiming, oh wait, we're going to give you the answer from Microsoft and Hillary Clinton.
[03:05:22.944 --> 03:05:27.549]  Have you heard about that Microsoft is going to be doing some of the collating of the numbers of the caucuses?
[03:05:27.569 --> 03:05:28.270]  Have you heard about that?
[03:05:29.116 --> 03:05:30.557]  No, I'm not familiar with that.
[03:05:30.937 --> 03:05:31.258]  Okay.
[03:05:31.638 --> 03:05:36.502]  Well, there's a concern that they could kind of put their thumb on the scale and change those numbers around.
[03:05:36.582 --> 03:05:39.083]  So I think a lot of Iowans are concerned.
[03:05:39.143 --> 03:05:42.206]  Are you going to, is that something you're going to look into?
[03:05:43.226 --> 03:05:51.653]  For my part, we've got a, I've got a special app on my cell phone and also on my tablet.
[03:05:52.453 --> 03:05:57.537]  And when soon as we take the straw, the straw vote is completed and counted.
[03:05:58.089 --> 03:06:03.274]  Yeah, I'll get on that app and send that information immediately to our home office in Des Moines.
[03:06:03.294 --> 03:06:04.595]  Yeah, that's the Microsoft app.
[03:06:05.036 --> 03:06:06.337]  Is that the Microsoft app?
[03:06:06.958 --> 03:06:08.739]  That may be the Microsoft app, but what you do...
[03:06:10.117 --> 03:06:14.939]  What Alex, I believe what he'll be able to do is, you will actually know the exact votes.
[03:06:15.199 --> 03:06:28.384]  You guys go up to the front of the room, when you get these 3x5 index cards, it's a secret ballot, people write down the name of the candidate, and then they go up to the front and there's at least five precinct officials that witness the counting of the votes.
[03:06:28.424 --> 03:06:29.005]  Is that correct?
[03:06:30.145 --> 03:06:34.447]  Each candidate can have one representative witness the count.
[03:06:35.302 --> 03:06:40.703]  Okay, so there could be, you know, 10 or 15 people up there in front, so there's going to be minimum 5.
[03:06:41.004 --> 03:06:42.564]  Alright, Richard.
[03:06:42.584 --> 03:06:43.024]  At least 7 or 8.
[03:06:43.444 --> 03:06:46.785]  Richard, talk to some of these ladies, and then I want you to wander around and talk to folks.
[03:06:47.085 --> 03:06:48.285]  This is pretty exciting reporting.
[03:06:48.305 --> 03:06:49.126]  I want to go for another hour.
[03:06:49.606 --> 03:06:50.606]  I've got to come on at 11.
[03:06:50.726 --> 03:06:53.867]  I would go forever, but I want to turn this loose soon and let you guys take over, because here's the deal.
[03:06:54.267 --> 03:06:59.852]  I'll talk to Leanne behind the scenes, Jakari, and my writers and just basic crew and they're smarter than I am.
[03:07:00.132 --> 03:07:04.236]  They get on air, they're all polite, they're nice, they don't let me run around like a crazy gorilla.
[03:07:05.037 --> 03:07:11.943]  I really want to hear like long five minute comments from Jakari and Leanne and people on the street and where's McBrain?
[03:07:11.983 --> 03:07:14.625]  That guy is so smart in private and then he doesn't want to ever go on air.
[03:07:14.645 --> 03:07:15.326]  I'm back here!
[03:07:15.806 --> 03:07:16.906]  Good, good, McBrain.
[03:07:16.946 --> 03:07:18.106]  I want to hear from you for a moment.
[03:07:18.486 --> 03:07:22.127]  And then I'm punching out, not because I don't want to be here, but because I'll stay here until 3am.
[03:07:22.407 --> 03:07:22.827]  Let's go to 11.
[03:07:22.867 --> 03:07:24.988]  You guys have another 50 minutes is good?
[03:07:25.008 --> 03:07:26.348]  Good for that?
[03:07:26.948 --> 03:07:29.668]  Kit and I were playing musical chairs.
[03:07:30.008 --> 03:07:30.989]  No, no, I love you, McBrain.
[03:07:31.029 --> 03:07:31.449]  You're awesome.
[03:07:32.009 --> 03:07:38.510]  We're good for that, but Jakari is now going to take over the traffic cop with Leanne McAdoo.
[03:07:39.750 --> 03:07:44.191]  I, in the interest of letting folks here get some front bench starting time,
[03:07:45.523 --> 03:07:46.865]  I'm going to go because I'm on at 11 a.m.
[03:07:46.905 --> 03:07:47.606]  Central tomorrow.
[03:07:47.926 --> 03:07:49.509]  Please support Infowars.com.
[03:07:49.929 --> 03:07:53.915]  We're going to be, I'll be honest, I'm going to, while I'm driving home, I'm going to be calling into the hotline.
[03:07:54.175 --> 03:07:57.259]  I'm going to go spend 10 minutes looking at all the polls and numbers to give some real analysis.
[03:07:57.620 --> 03:07:58.541]  And I'm going to be calling in.
[03:07:58.962 --> 03:08:02.406]  And just great job to the crew and the people behind the scenes that have busted their butts.
[03:08:03.007 --> 03:08:04.688]  I'd barely have a crew to run all this.
[03:08:04.808 --> 03:08:12.513]  We're trying to get enough money to hire a couple more editors and live switchers so that people get vacations or folks don't work 18 hours when we do special events.
[03:08:12.814 --> 03:08:22.540]  Because we're going to start doing more and more coverage, more and more of big events, and it's amazing to know that sometimes we do this and 3 million people tune in, sometimes it's 500,000, 100,000, whatever.
[03:08:22.820 --> 03:08:23.321]  It's big.
[03:08:23.361 --> 03:08:25.842]  I mean, what is that like, Jakari, to be able to reach this many people?
[03:08:25.862 --> 03:08:26.503]  Is that not amazing?
[03:08:27.093 --> 03:08:31.617]  Yeah, I mean it is quite something to see the way the operation has grown since I've been here.
[03:08:32.298 --> 03:08:34.840]  Several hundred thousand more people join you on YouTube.
[03:08:34.860 --> 03:08:38.443]  I think when I came here you had about 300,000 or so, now you got over a million.
[03:08:38.523 --> 03:08:39.164]  That's just on one channel?
[03:08:39.184 --> 03:08:40.345]  Yeah, that's just on one channel.
[03:08:40.365 --> 03:08:41.005]  Subscribers?
[03:08:41.285 --> 03:08:41.406]  Yeah.
[03:08:41.971 --> 03:08:42.251]  I think so.
[03:09:02.489 --> 03:09:09.792]  You know, basically cover all this, and then I want to go back to Richard to talk to some folks, then back to Joe Biggs, back to Darren McBreen and others, but great job.
[03:09:10.512 --> 03:09:11.493]  This has been a fun debate.
[03:09:11.553 --> 03:09:12.733]  I've not been here for the other debates.
[03:09:12.793 --> 03:09:13.794]  I used to do it before you were here.
[03:09:14.314 --> 03:09:16.295]  Is it fun to have me for the debate, or would you rather David Knight?
[03:09:17.235 --> 03:09:18.896]  You guys both bring something different to it.
[03:09:19.662 --> 03:09:20.442]  Is it more analysis?
[03:09:20.482 --> 03:09:23.864]  Yours is... I mean, you're doing analysis too, but... Screaming that she's a tranny.
[03:09:24.144 --> 03:09:25.384]  Yeah, you do stuff like that.
[03:09:25.924 --> 03:09:27.245]  It's a little different.
[03:09:27.765 --> 03:09:30.746]  Well, they're teaching five-year-olds that in school, so I might as well make a joke out of it.
[03:09:30.766 --> 03:09:30.966]  Yeah.
[03:09:31.446 --> 03:09:31.646]  Yeah.
[03:09:31.947 --> 03:09:32.367]  Be honest.
[03:09:32.387 --> 03:09:34.448]  Do you think we're going to win the InfoWars, Jakari?
[03:09:35.028 --> 03:09:39.289]  I think we're going to do the best we can, and it's going to take a lot of people beyond us.
[03:09:39.489 --> 03:09:40.730]  I guess that's the best way to say it.
[03:09:40.970 --> 03:09:43.491]  It depends on how many people decide to get involved.
[03:09:44.090 --> 03:09:45.331]  Well, I want to say something, Jakari.
[03:09:46.072 --> 03:09:56.261]  It is so awesome that you took the job here, that you won that contest, and it was ten times better than I thought, and same thing with Liam, and McBreen, and all the crew.
[03:09:56.281 --> 03:10:04.789]  I just, I just, working with you guys, seeing you develop everything you do, I'm sorry to do this, I just have to say, it is so much fun to work with you guys.
[03:10:05.870 --> 03:10:07.532]  And InfoWars is such a special place.
[03:10:08.183 --> 03:10:15.170]  I mean, it really is original, it's different, and you folks out there made it by spreading the word, by buying the products, by supporting our sponsors.
[03:10:15.270 --> 03:10:16.151]  Thank you, viewers.
[03:10:17.012 --> 03:10:19.354]  One of our newest additions, what, three, four months here, Zimmerman?
[03:10:20.555 --> 03:10:22.077]  And my Michael Zimmerman kicking ass?
[03:10:22.117 --> 03:10:23.038]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[03:10:23.378 --> 03:10:25.761]  So, we're gonna let you guys, Jakar, you take over.
[03:10:26.936 --> 03:10:29.137]  I guess go ahead and what do you want to do?
[03:10:29.657 --> 03:10:31.058]  You want to go to Reeves first?
[03:10:31.118 --> 03:10:31.658]  You want to go?
[03:10:31.678 --> 03:10:34.840]  Yeah, if he's ready to go, yes go ahead.
[03:10:34.860 --> 03:10:36.821]  Alright Reeves, you take over, walk through the crowd.
[03:10:37.161 --> 03:10:39.902]  Reeves, give us your take on what you saw tonight, then take us to the crowd.
[03:10:39.942 --> 03:10:40.262]  Go ahead.
[03:10:41.302 --> 03:10:51.107]  Well, what I saw tonight was a media zoo and we've got this gentleman here, veteran here, that's been, he's had a really long night, so final words from you, sir.
[03:10:52.421 --> 03:10:56.043]  It's been a great night, and Donald Trump is the very greatest.
[03:10:56.543 --> 03:11:00.826]  He's the only candidate, in my opinion, that can make America great again.
[03:11:00.846 --> 03:11:02.347]  And I say, go Trump.
[03:11:02.887 --> 03:11:09.031]  And if you're in Iowa watching this, go caucus Monday night and caucus for Trump.
[03:11:09.911 --> 03:11:13.773]  And may God bless this great nation of America.
[03:11:13.793 --> 03:11:15.875]  All right, well, thank you for your service, sir.
[03:11:16.575 --> 03:11:17.476]  We really appreciate it.
[03:11:17.496 --> 03:11:18.656]  And you take care.
[03:11:19.277 --> 03:11:19.777]  Have a good night.
[03:11:20.433 --> 03:11:25.115]  Alright, we've got a couple other folks here that, uh, they've never been to a caucus here.
[03:11:25.695 --> 03:11:26.956]  These are new caucus goers.
[03:11:26.976 --> 03:11:30.558]  This lady, actually, I happened to see her over in Iowa City a while back.
[03:11:30.578 --> 03:11:31.518]  Ma'am, what's your name again?
[03:11:31.858 --> 03:11:32.979]  My name is Karen DeMoore.
[03:11:33.539 --> 03:11:34.039]  Hi, Karen.
[03:11:34.159 --> 03:11:34.619]  And your daughter?
[03:11:35.080 --> 03:11:35.420]  Elise.
[03:11:36.020 --> 03:11:36.340]  Elise?
[03:11:37.041 --> 03:11:37.361]  Elise.
[03:11:37.761 --> 03:11:40.742]  Alright, so this is your first time caucusing, so you're really ready.
[03:11:40.802 --> 03:11:44.484]  This is something that finally, it's like, hey, this is important enough, I'm going to get out there and do this.
[03:11:45.043 --> 03:11:53.187]  I heard recently that a lot of people, it's their first time to caucus, so I thought that was very interesting that I, out of the blue, decided to do that as well.
[03:11:53.207 --> 03:11:54.188]  And I really didn't know.
[03:11:54.228 --> 03:11:59.971]  I was in Iowa City on Tuesday night for the rally and they were encouraging people to sign up, so I went and I filled out the card.
[03:12:00.832 --> 03:12:02.993]  So yeah, I'll be doing my first caucus on Monday.
[03:12:03.672 --> 03:12:05.233]  Well, it is a pretty simple process.
[03:12:05.534 --> 03:12:08.356]  Basically, like the gentleman was saying earlier, you get there at 6 p.m.
[03:12:08.396 --> 03:12:11.098]  here in Iowa, but they close the doors at 7.
[03:12:11.339 --> 03:12:13.340]  As my understanding is, 7 p.m.
[03:12:13.380 --> 03:12:14.261]  they close the doors.
[03:12:14.281 --> 03:12:16.323]  So if you get there late, you're not going to get in.
[03:12:16.383 --> 03:12:18.264]  So you need to be there in time to caucus.
[03:12:18.845 --> 03:12:21.807]  And then, like I say, they have some housekeeping items.
[03:12:21.827 --> 03:12:23.549]  They elect officers and things like that.
[03:12:24.169 --> 03:12:30.234]  And like that gentleman just told us a little while ago, you could have up to 10 or 15 people that are witnessing these slips of paper.
[03:12:32.357 --> 03:12:34.103]  Earlier we were talking about the Microsoft issue.
[03:12:34.123 --> 03:12:35.087]  Have you heard anything about that?
[03:12:35.107 --> 03:12:36.050]  Have you looked into that at all?
[03:12:36.536 --> 03:12:43.941]  I did hear about Microsoft, and I saw a little bit of information on TV about it, so I'm not concerned that it's going to be tipped in any way.
[03:12:43.981 --> 03:12:47.324]  I think, actually, it's just going to expedite finding out the results.
[03:12:47.344 --> 03:12:49.165]  All right, well, thank you so much, Richard.
[03:12:49.325 --> 03:12:53.328]  We're going to move around to some of our other reporters, but, of course, continue what you're doing.
[03:12:53.368 --> 03:12:55.749]  We'll check back with you before we sign off here.
[03:12:56.410 --> 03:12:57.491]  OK, Jakari, thank you.
[03:12:57.511 --> 03:12:58.631]  All right, thank you so much, Richard.
[03:12:58.651 --> 03:13:00.953]  All right, so there goes Richard Reeves, I believe.
[03:13:01.013 --> 03:13:01.593]  Oh, there we go.
[03:13:01.633 --> 03:13:04.155]  We got Darren McBrain and Alex Jones in the studio.
[03:13:04.215 --> 03:13:04.896]  How did that happen?
[03:13:05.635 --> 03:13:06.235]  I'm back!
[03:13:06.575 --> 03:13:07.096]  He's back.
[03:13:08.356 --> 03:13:08.996]  I'm leaving.
[03:13:09.016 --> 03:13:12.318]  I'm going to listen to you guys on the free iPhone app as I drive home.
[03:13:12.658 --> 03:13:13.338]  I love you all.
[03:13:13.698 --> 03:13:14.299]  Great job.
[03:13:14.379 --> 03:13:15.179]  Give me the hotline number.
[03:13:15.199 --> 03:13:15.959]  I'll be calling in.
[03:13:16.259 --> 03:13:17.040]  Sorry, Jakari.
[03:13:17.060 --> 03:13:17.900]  Go back to what you were saying.
[03:13:18.729 --> 03:13:24.292]  All right, and there goes Alex Jones.
[03:13:24.372 --> 03:13:26.973]  You can see all the great crew out there working overtime.
[03:13:27.133 --> 03:13:30.195]  The guys get here pretty early in the morning, starting on the radio show.
[03:13:30.215 --> 03:13:34.057]  Some of the radio crew still there, as well as the nightly news crew.
[03:13:34.117 --> 03:13:36.658]  Now, I know Kit was at the Twitter station at one point.
[03:13:36.698 --> 03:13:37.418]  Is he still out there?
[03:13:39.019 --> 03:13:41.280]  Okay, so Kit is taking a powder, as it were.
[03:13:41.801 --> 03:13:44.862]  So I think this is a good time to kind of rehash what's going on.
[03:13:44.922 --> 03:13:46.443]  Or did you have something to say, Marcos?
[03:13:47.788 --> 03:13:48.928]  Wait, we still have Biggs on the line.
[03:13:48.988 --> 03:13:49.508]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[03:13:49.528 --> 03:13:50.048]  Joe Biggs.
[03:13:50.189 --> 03:13:54.669]  Alright, so Joe Biggs, you're still out there in Oregon in your hotel room.
[03:13:54.749 --> 03:13:58.710]  So, you were telling us about Megyn Kelly and pretty much your experience with that.
[03:13:58.990 --> 03:14:01.191]  Were you finished with that story or was there more to it?
[03:14:02.431 --> 03:14:06.912]  Yeah, but I mean, I was just listening to Richard and how they're talking about Monday is going to be a big caucus.
[03:14:07.452 --> 03:14:11.553]  So, hopefully everyone shows up for that big caucus and they enjoy that.
[03:14:11.693 --> 03:14:15.754]  But outside of that, yeah, Megyn Kelly is definitely a pretty
[03:14:19.078 --> 03:14:22.940]  I don't like her too much.
[03:14:22.960 --> 03:14:24.421]  But other than that, I've been enjoying everything.
[03:14:24.481 --> 03:14:26.462]  The debate tonight has been interesting.
[03:14:27.163 --> 03:14:28.883]  I actually just read some polls.
[03:14:29.364 --> 03:14:43.411]  Now that you take Trump away from the Trump Circus, away from the actual debate, Rand Paul has been leading in the numbers thus far and has continued to do so throughout the night, which is pretty awesome to see him.
[03:14:43.431 --> 03:14:44.492]  He's actually got a chance to
[03:14:45.367 --> 03:15:02.795]  Not be overshadowed by the mass parade that goes on that is Trump, and everyone gets a chance to actually really speak without the mainstream media, the main focus on attacking Trump or getting the other candidates to attack him as if they can get some reality TV response.
[03:15:04.400 --> 03:15:19.586]  Yeah, I mean, when you look at somebody like Donald Trump, as we've been talking about, and I'm not exactly sure what your view is, Biggs, but I definitely respect his boldness, you know, the way he speaks his mind on certain issues, even if I don't agree with him, I definitely respect that.
[03:15:20.007 --> 03:15:32.592]  But when I look at things such as his desire to increase the domestic surveillance state, his desire to put people on no-fly, no-gun-by lists, all these other things, and Reindeer Daniels is over here, I guess we can take
[03:15:33.752 --> 03:15:57.098]  But here's the thing though, if you're a part of the so-called Patriot group, you know, because there's so many different versions of it, but if you're a part of this Patriot group and you're actually really concerned about what's going on with the BLM and you don't like the federal government coming in and sweeping and taking land, then how in the hell can you even wholeheartedly
[03:15:58.061 --> 03:16:01.984]  Support Donald Trump, and that is the person who supports eminent domain.
[03:16:02.004 --> 03:16:10.531]  That's the one who goes in, he's the big guy, he represents the big government, he wants to go in and use his money and power to bully you, take your land, and use it to put a hotel on.
[03:16:11.031 --> 03:16:22.120]  And it's no different than the BLM where President Obama wanted to take 2 million acres out here in Oregon to make a national refuge or a huge monument for the federal government.
[03:16:22.400 --> 03:16:26.083]  But the land that they're trying to take from people out here in Oregon is honey land.
[03:16:26.826 --> 03:16:29.128]  It's land for loggers, it's land for ranchers.
[03:16:29.669 --> 03:16:38.636]  So if you claim to be a patriot, and you claim to be part of this movement, but then you are all of a sudden for Trump in that sense, I just don't get it.
[03:16:38.917 --> 03:16:45.503]  I'm completely confused by how people are like, oh, I stand with the Hammonds, I stand with the Bundys, but I'm voting for Trump.
[03:16:45.663 --> 03:16:48.165]  Completely going against that contradicts itself.
[03:16:48.760 --> 03:16:50.082]  Well, I do agree with that.
[03:16:50.122 --> 03:16:57.550]  That was always my issue with Trump, and also my confusion when dealing with people in the conservative community.
[03:16:58.251 --> 03:17:02.857]  They mentioned many of the same things that you mentioned right there, but then they would vote for a guy like Donald Trump.
[03:17:02.877 --> 03:17:08.944]  And like I said, I do respect some of his boldness, but his policies are, you know, very lacking in my personal opinion.
[03:17:09.745 --> 03:17:14.690]  Honestly, I think he's captivating Republicans now in a similar way that Obama did in 2008.
[03:17:15.251 --> 03:17:18.835]  Granted, Obama was elected on a bunch of campaign lies.
[03:17:18.875 --> 03:17:22.058]  Trump is telling you straight up he's going to take your rights away and people still want him to be president.
[03:17:23.139 --> 03:17:24.521]  So, to each his own on that regard.
[03:17:26.161 --> 03:17:27.822]  He's a popular guy in high school, you know.
[03:17:28.563 --> 03:17:32.346]  People, they see something, they want to follow it, they think it's cool.
[03:17:32.686 --> 03:17:34.828]  They think that his coolness is going to rub off on them.
[03:17:34.888 --> 03:17:37.250]  Maybe they'll get something out of it down the road.
[03:17:37.270 --> 03:17:39.091]  But at the end of the day, stop thinking about that.
[03:17:39.131 --> 03:17:40.752]  You need to think about the future of the country.
[03:17:41.313 --> 03:17:50.380]  And really, when you look at it and you lay down the facts, you look at these people who are what they're running on, and you look at it all, the only clear choice I see is Ray and Paul.
[03:17:50.839 --> 03:17:53.942]  You know, I think Rand Paul could work with a number of other candidates.
[03:17:54.082 --> 03:17:55.784]  Maybe they could put a good team together.
[03:17:56.145 --> 03:17:57.987]  But I think he's the best choice.
[03:17:59.528 --> 03:18:02.471]  I'm sorry Biggs, Alex is joining us once again.
[03:18:02.491 --> 03:18:05.174]  I don't have headphones on and I'm leaving.
[03:18:05.194 --> 03:18:08.057]  And I'm going to be calling in once I'm on the road.
[03:18:08.578 --> 03:18:10.760]  Listening on the iPhone app on the local radio station.
[03:18:11.341 --> 03:18:12.342]  But I'm going to be honest here.
[03:18:13.490 --> 03:18:14.751]  Because we're all on the same page.
[03:18:14.771 --> 03:18:17.172]  People say, why does one writer say one thing and another says another view?
[03:18:17.212 --> 03:18:18.592]  Because we're not... It's all different.
[03:18:18.652 --> 03:18:20.733]  We're not drinking Kool-Aid around here at Jim Jones' house.
[03:18:20.993 --> 03:18:22.134]  Even though my last name's Jones.
[03:18:22.434 --> 03:18:22.994]  Not my fault.
[03:18:23.695 --> 03:18:24.455]  But here's the deal.
[03:18:25.235 --> 03:18:26.476]  I don't think Trump's perfect.
[03:18:27.376 --> 03:18:28.937]  But the establishment hates him.
[03:18:30.378 --> 03:18:30.518]  And...
[03:18:31.977 --> 03:18:34.040]  The whole point is I'm not voting for Hillary or Jeb.
[03:18:34.140 --> 03:18:38.926]  I'm always saying forget the presidency, work off the state level like Greg Abbott and fight all this stuff.
[03:18:39.346 --> 03:18:43.391]  But all I'm saying is I'm not supporting him because he's the cool guy at high school.
[03:18:43.411 --> 03:18:46.194]  I thought he was a goofball with orange hair and didn't like him six months ago.
[03:18:47.190 --> 03:18:49.010]  I don't like him because he came on my show.
[03:18:49.771 --> 03:18:52.951]  I was invited to hang out with Bush and everybody else and Clinton before that.
[03:18:53.692 --> 03:18:53.992]  Okay?
[03:18:54.312 --> 03:18:54.952]  And I didn't do it.
[03:18:55.292 --> 03:18:56.592]  Trump has got him pissed.
[03:18:57.052 --> 03:18:58.333]  Trump has got him concerned.
[03:18:58.753 --> 03:19:03.134]  And I just think it's too easy to sit there, and I'm not disagreeing with Biggs totally.
[03:19:03.574 --> 03:19:05.194]  I just don't think he's the main enemy.
[03:19:05.554 --> 03:19:05.854]  Okay?
[03:19:06.294 --> 03:19:06.715]  Here, here.
[03:19:07.015 --> 03:19:08.335]  Let's switch off Trump for a minute.
[03:19:09.246 --> 03:19:12.769]  Who do you support more, Hillary or Jeb Bush?
[03:19:12.929 --> 03:19:14.331]  Let's talk about those two.
[03:19:14.551 --> 03:19:16.272]  Or, here, let's change the subject.
[03:19:16.813 --> 03:19:17.834]  I want to hear this next five minutes.
[03:19:17.854 --> 03:19:18.694]  I'm getting in the car, I want to hear it.
[03:19:18.955 --> 03:19:20.576]  Please, I don't ask for much of this.
[03:19:21.097 --> 03:19:26.341]  I want a discussion of Hillary, I want a discussion of Jeb Bush, and I want a discussion of Ted Cruz.
[03:19:26.361 --> 03:19:27.382]  Because I like Ted Cruz.
[03:19:27.642 --> 03:19:31.186]  Oh my God, his wife was in the CFR and Goldman Sachs.
[03:19:31.206 --> 03:19:32.607]  What do you expect of the elites?
[03:19:32.947 --> 03:19:34.948]  If we don't get some converts, we're screwed!
[03:19:35.228 --> 03:19:36.049]  We want to win!
[03:19:36.069 --> 03:19:41.232]  And if they get in and do bad stuff, we run over them like Boner or Boehner.
[03:19:41.772 --> 03:19:44.153]  So I want Ryan to be thrown out.
[03:19:44.774 --> 03:19:46.815]  Yeah, but see, once they're in, they're so hard to get.
[03:19:46.855 --> 03:19:52.638]  Leanne, we have the Congressmen and Senators on, and the Black Lives Commanders coming on, because they know we can make change.
[03:19:53.078 --> 03:19:54.279]  There's good people in government.
[03:19:54.699 --> 03:19:55.760]  They've got to get our support.
[03:19:56.440 --> 03:20:00.743]  And so all I'm saying is we can't be 100% purist that everybody's corrupt and we're going down.
[03:20:01.103 --> 03:20:02.545]  I'm not saying even trust Trump.
[03:20:02.885 --> 03:20:03.986]  I'm going to just off Trump.
[03:20:05.106 --> 03:20:05.587]  Hillary.
[03:20:06.167 --> 03:20:06.708]  Jeb.
[03:20:07.908 --> 03:20:08.169]  Cruz.
[03:20:08.429 --> 03:20:08.869]  Cruz.
[03:20:09.550 --> 03:20:10.630]  Let's talk about them.
[03:20:10.671 --> 03:20:11.811]  Okay, Trump's the devil.
[03:20:12.792 --> 03:20:13.833]  To hell with the devil.
[03:20:14.573 --> 03:20:15.814]  All right, Biggs is right.
[03:20:16.295 --> 03:20:17.476]  All right, he's the problem.
[03:20:17.956 --> 03:20:19.217]  Now, you're faced with Hillary.
[03:20:20.302 --> 03:20:22.624]  You're faced with Jeb Bush.
[03:20:23.645 --> 03:20:24.366]  What do you do?
[03:20:24.726 --> 03:20:27.568]  What do you do, bad boys, when the Easter Bunny comes for you?
[03:20:27.588 --> 03:20:28.509]  Now I'm leaving.
[03:20:29.150 --> 03:20:31.071]  You've got 25 minutes left.
[03:20:31.372 --> 03:20:34.154]  We're Papa Goblin and Papa Dragon in here in the office.
[03:20:34.174 --> 03:20:34.514]  Go ahead.
[03:20:34.534 --> 03:20:35.976]  Alright, I'll be the first to start.
[03:20:36.396 --> 03:20:42.922]  Alright, when I talk about Hillary Clinton, I'm reminded of the conversation we had with Larry Nichols, who Alex sent
[03:20:43.722 --> 03:20:44.203]  I think so.
[03:21:03.078 --> 03:21:09.903]  Now, to the flip side of that, I'm reminded of Governor Jesse Ventura, who tells the story about how wrestling is much like politics.
[03:21:10.363 --> 03:21:14.746]  I hate this guy, I'm gonna kick this guy's butt, and afterwards they go out and they have a beer and they have a steak.
[03:21:15.006 --> 03:21:19.809]  And then I look at a guy like Donald Trump, who invites Hillary Clinton to his wedding.
[03:21:20.009 --> 03:21:24.612]  I've heard of keep your friends close and your enemies closer, I've never heard of invite your enemies to your wedding.
[03:21:24.733 --> 03:21:26.594]  But Hillary said she didn't get him a gift.
[03:21:27.059 --> 03:21:28.160]  So that's my issue about it.
[03:21:28.200 --> 03:21:32.885]  I'm not exactly convinced that either of them are these bitter enemies that they want you to believe.
[03:21:33.546 --> 03:21:43.898]  Going on to guys like... Well, I will say they're probably not going to be very friendly at the table now that he went there and, you know, drug her husband across the coals.
[03:21:44.758 --> 03:21:45.599]  Yeah, I'm sure.
[03:22:07.273 --> 03:22:14.157]  George Bush, his brother, and went for Obama just for that reason, are supporting a guy now in Obama who's doing similar things to what Bush did.
[03:22:14.637 --> 03:22:22.862]  Obama comes out, he says, the Bushes, they're pushing war, they're pushing all this stuff, they're pushing the NSA surveillance or, you know, the things that are going on at the time, the Patriot Act.
[03:22:23.142 --> 03:22:25.083]  Then Obama comes out and pushes those same things.
[03:22:25.583 --> 03:22:29.645]  And I'm not thinking that the apple's going to fall too far from the tree once you get to Jeb Bush.
[03:22:29.665 --> 03:22:34.248]  So that's also my issue when we have with him, you know, many other characters that
[03:22:34.428 --> 03:22:36.169]  Still seems like he has daddy issues.
[03:22:36.209 --> 03:22:41.990]  Like he still needs to please in the legacy and you know, he's not going to go out there and be his own man.
[03:22:42.370 --> 03:22:44.571]  Yeah, I think he's really working off legacy.
[03:22:44.651 --> 03:22:47.192]  I think he's working more off legacy, honestly, than Hillary is.
[03:22:47.612 --> 03:22:50.293]  Hillary, I think she is very proactive in that sense.
[03:22:50.313 --> 03:22:51.513]  She's her own woman.
[03:22:51.613 --> 03:22:57.355]  I think she allowed all that stuff to go on with Bill because it was more about the power play.
[03:22:57.395 --> 03:23:00.036]  It was more about the ultimate goal of power.
[03:23:00.056 --> 03:23:01.156]  Sorry, I have to interrupt programming.
[03:23:01.296 --> 03:23:01.596]  I'm sorry.
[03:23:01.616 --> 03:23:02.516]  I'm about to leave now.
[03:23:02.536 --> 03:23:03.257]  Now I'm in the studio.
[03:23:03.297 --> 03:23:03.677]  I'm sorry.
[03:23:04.437 --> 03:23:05.718]  I'm sorry, I just keep doing this.
[03:23:06.038 --> 03:23:06.939]  It's actually part of the fun.
[03:23:07.359 --> 03:23:10.542]  Do you realize that Janet Reno's Dream Girl is on screen right now, Megyn Kelly?
[03:23:11.202 --> 03:23:12.203]  I'm not a fan of that.
[03:23:12.243 --> 03:23:16.386]  Literally, Rachel Maddow's Dream Girl is on TV right now.
[03:23:16.446 --> 03:23:18.068]  I'm leaving, that's why I'm not on there at night.
[03:23:18.288 --> 03:23:19.128]  I'm gonna be a good boy.
[03:23:19.148 --> 03:23:19.549]  Bye bye.
[03:23:19.849 --> 03:23:20.990]  I'm now actually leaving the building.
[03:23:21.010 --> 03:23:23.452]  You now have 35 minutes of transmission.
[03:23:23.592 --> 03:23:25.113]  No, we just got more time.
[03:23:25.133 --> 03:23:26.174]  Alright.
[03:23:27.506 --> 03:23:31.689]  Well, it's clear that Fox News is rallying around Cruz.
[03:23:31.849 --> 03:23:33.690]  Did I say Fox News and Cruz?
[03:23:34.691 --> 03:23:36.972]  I mean, they've got him on right after the debate.
[03:23:36.992 --> 03:23:45.678]  They want to talk to him, so... So, since we're on the topic of Ted Cruz, what are your thoughts about Ted Cruz?
[03:23:46.491 --> 03:23:48.152]  I just can't stand listening to him.
[03:23:48.412 --> 03:23:51.113]  I think he sounds like a little mouse.
[03:23:51.913 --> 03:23:53.914]  Like his name should be Orville Redenbacher.
[03:23:54.074 --> 03:23:59.296]  That's what he, he just has that look about him where he's like, oh, and I just, I don't like him.
[03:23:59.356 --> 03:24:02.577]  He's very wormy and like a rat.
[03:24:02.877 --> 03:24:04.478]  He's just like a little mouse or something.
[03:24:04.498 --> 03:24:06.119]  I don't, uh, I don't trust him.
[03:24:10.851 --> 03:24:14.113]  It's time to spend time with Kelly.
[03:24:14.193 --> 03:24:15.554]  Oh, God, I'm on air!
[03:24:15.854 --> 03:24:17.655]  I told you not to open that, I was up having fun.
[03:24:17.995 --> 03:24:19.056]  No, that's it, now I'm gone.
[03:24:19.436 --> 03:24:22.838]  Comedy's over.
[03:24:24.059 --> 03:24:25.340]  We care what the media thinks!
[03:24:25.560 --> 03:24:26.100]  We care!
[03:24:26.240 --> 03:24:28.081]  Oh, please don't talk bad about us, media.
[03:24:28.301 --> 03:24:29.222]  It hurts us so bad.
[03:24:30.983 --> 03:24:32.504]  Yeah, one thing I like about, uh...
[03:24:33.342 --> 03:24:35.145]  Yeah, Ken has some key stuff to say earlier.
[03:24:35.365 --> 03:24:36.687]  Make your point about populism.
[03:24:37.207 --> 03:24:37.308]  Yeah.
[03:24:37.328 --> 03:24:38.589]  That's why I'm so excited right now.
[03:24:38.629 --> 03:24:39.330]  We're on the march.
[03:24:39.651 --> 03:24:40.512]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:24:40.552 --> 03:24:41.373]  Infowars.com.
[03:24:41.914 --> 03:24:44.498]  Yeah, it's like... Did I mention sales of nutraceuticals?
[03:24:45.270 --> 03:24:48.153]  Yeah, I want to say one thing about Trump, though, moving on to Ted Cruz.
[03:24:49.274 --> 03:24:53.678]  One thing I like about Trump is the fact that, yeah, people don't agree with everything he says.
[03:24:53.718 --> 03:24:59.183]  You know, there's even stuff that he's pushed about intimate domain in the past, so on and so forth.
[03:24:59.204 --> 03:25:02.967]  But one thing I do like about him is... The power of Isengard is now at your command.
[03:25:04.068 --> 03:25:07.090]  Yeah, he's like SORON, RULER OF THE EARTH.
[03:25:07.510 --> 03:25:08.810]  Oh, sorry, I had to hold it off for a minute.
[03:25:09.111 --> 03:25:10.311]  Go ahead, Kit, I apologize.
[03:25:10.491 --> 03:25:17.275]  Yeah, people are like, a lot of libertarians are claiming that Trump's like a SORON, this and that, you know, he's authoritarian and blah, blah.
[03:25:17.735 --> 03:25:27.300]  But Trump is at least pushing the Overton window up a couple inches towards liberty, and I have never seen a candidate in a presidential election that's really been able to do that in my entire lifetime.
[03:25:27.320 --> 03:25:29.161]  Populist firebrand, Kit Daniels, continue.
[03:25:30.049 --> 03:25:35.091]  Yeah, and going on to Ted Cruz, one thing I do like about Ted Cruz is his rhetoric.
[03:25:35.751 --> 03:25:38.032]  Like, he talks about very libertarian stuff.
[03:25:38.072 --> 03:25:42.714]  Like, he wrote that, I think it was the New York Times on January of last year.
[03:25:42.734 --> 03:25:44.274]  He's definitely an ideologue.
[03:25:44.294 --> 03:25:45.054]  Here's the danger.
[03:25:45.495 --> 03:25:52.797]  You know that Alan Greenspan, 40-something years ago, was friends with Ron Paul, was the leader of the libertarian movement, wrote books against the New World Order.
[03:25:53.017 --> 03:25:53.277]  Yeah.
[03:25:53.317 --> 03:25:56.499]  So you can also... Now that's a guy who joins Thoron.
[03:25:59.924 --> 03:26:01.105]  But I'm not saying he's going to do that.
[03:26:01.125 --> 03:26:04.287]  The point is Trump is already orange top capped.
[03:26:04.867 --> 03:26:05.187]  Vader.
[03:26:05.808 --> 03:26:06.308]  Leigh-Anne, go ahead.
[03:26:06.328 --> 03:26:07.008]  Do you have something to say?
[03:26:07.028 --> 03:26:08.589]  No, it's just Darth Vader is right there.
[03:26:08.609 --> 03:26:09.930]  Oh yeah, right behind me?
[03:26:10.070 --> 03:26:10.230]  Yeah.
[03:26:10.310 --> 03:26:11.410]  Alright, that's it.
[03:26:11.450 --> 03:26:11.931]  I'm leaving now.
[03:26:11.991 --> 03:26:12.411]  I apologize.
[03:26:12.431 --> 03:26:15.272]  Bye bye.
[03:26:15.312 --> 03:26:16.293]  Go ahead with your point, kid.
[03:26:16.613 --> 03:26:17.974]  Well, Elvis has left the building.
[03:26:18.561 --> 03:26:27.403]  Yeah, I mean, the thing about Cruz is, like, when he attacked Obama over his imperial presidency last year, he was taught, he quoted Montesquieu, and this and that.
[03:26:27.423 --> 03:26:33.804]  The only person I've ever heard anyone that quoted, like, Adam Smith, John Locke, and those kind of guys has been Ron Paul.
[03:26:34.524 --> 03:26:42.906]  So, Ted Cruz, I have my own concerns about Ted Cruz, but it's like, all of a sudden we have these presidential candidates, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, that are
[03:26:43.902 --> 03:26:46.844]  They're saying stuff that you will never hear from establishment candidates.
[03:26:46.964 --> 03:26:52.288]  And you and Leanne talked about earlier about how Clinton and Bush are living off their legacies.
[03:26:52.328 --> 03:26:53.348]  It even goes beyond that.
[03:26:53.368 --> 03:26:58.552]  They're living off the establishment legacy that goes back, like the Blue Bud families, the Bushes.
[03:26:58.572 --> 03:27:01.013]  I think they're related to royalty.
[03:27:01.434 --> 03:27:03.755]  I think it's like the Queen of England back hundreds of decades.
[03:27:03.795 --> 03:27:05.877]  I think Jim Mars wrote a book about that recently.
[03:27:06.667 --> 03:27:19.743]  So, it's just so ridiculous that people don't understand that the whole state's craft, Machiavelli, this whole system of dominance and control of governments that we have today dates back 1,500-2,000 years.
[03:27:19.843 --> 03:27:23.047]  We had Roman emperors doing the exact same thing that we have presidents doing right now.
[03:27:23.803 --> 03:27:24.704]  Right, it's the playbook.
[03:27:24.764 --> 03:27:30.429]  They use the same plays over and over and over again and the reason why they do so is because they work.
[03:27:30.930 --> 03:27:37.296]  Except for now they have more advanced technology where it's a lot easier to distract the serfs.
[03:27:37.336 --> 03:27:41.760]  You don't just have to give them the Olympics or the football games.
[03:27:41.920 --> 03:27:47.525]  We've got that too, but now there's 300 different television stations.
[03:27:47.585 --> 03:27:48.346]  You've got over a thousand.
[03:27:49.474 --> 03:27:50.435]  I don't have a television.
[03:27:50.655 --> 03:27:57.281]  Alex, two years ago when I interviewed Ron Paul for the Nightly News, he said something that I still remember today.
[03:27:57.301 --> 03:28:03.607]  He said that governments, it's kind of like they have exhausted their experimentation on how to control the population.
[03:28:04.368 --> 03:28:07.591]  And I think that's very key today with Donald Trump.
[03:28:08.052 --> 03:28:13.176]  His establishment has, like you said, has run all these playbooks and the Federal Reserve has even run their own playbooks on how to
[03:28:13.857 --> 03:28:19.757]  You know, steal countries' assets through all these rotten loans that they can never pay off, like in South America.
[03:28:20.509 --> 03:28:31.134]  But yeah, governments have used all these different experiments and playbooks for the last 1,500 years on how to control the population, and now they're just completely running out of ideas and it's no longer working.
[03:28:31.894 --> 03:28:43.600]  And, you know, with the rise of the Internet, you have an explosion of Austrian economics and ideas that are rapidly expanding across borders and across ideologies and, you know, cultures.
[03:28:44.620 --> 03:28:50.422]  So now this is exactly why we see a populist movement led by Trump and Cruz and Rand Paul and so on and so forth.
[03:28:51.223 --> 03:28:51.663]  Very good.
[03:28:51.703 --> 03:28:52.643]  Very good, Kit Daniels.
[03:28:52.683 --> 03:28:54.284]  Now we're going to jump now to Joe Biggs.
[03:28:54.304 --> 03:28:55.124]  You can hang tight, Kit.
[03:28:55.144 --> 03:28:56.405]  We'll come back to you here in a little bit.
[03:28:56.825 --> 03:28:59.866]  But Biggs, you've been waiting in the wings and listening to what we have to say.
[03:28:59.886 --> 03:29:01.326]  And I know you've got an early day tomorrow.
[03:29:01.346 --> 03:29:04.228]  You've got to get back out there in Oregon and find out what's going on.
[03:29:04.308 --> 03:29:07.789]  So just give us your take on what we've been talking about and give us your sign-off.
[03:29:09.370 --> 03:29:09.610]  Oh, no.
[03:29:09.630 --> 03:29:10.090]  It's so good.
[03:29:10.110 --> 03:29:11.350]  It's only like 8 o'clock here, man.
[03:29:11.410 --> 03:29:11.670]  Oh, wow.
[03:29:11.750 --> 03:29:11.850]  OK.
[03:29:11.910 --> 03:29:13.031]  We've got all the time in the world.
[03:29:13.579 --> 03:29:14.279]  I'm still hanging out.
[03:29:14.899 --> 03:29:17.880]  Back to Ted Cruz though, I think he's like the weasel guy in high school.
[03:29:18.240 --> 03:29:19.360]  He just raps on everyone.
[03:29:20.241 --> 03:29:21.781]  He tattletales on everybody.
[03:29:22.401 --> 03:29:32.124]  Honestly, if I was Rand Paul, I'd make Donald Trump my vice president and I think I would let Ted Cruz have a position in there with me as well.
[03:29:32.904 --> 03:29:40.786]  Maybe he could go in and take over all the media stuff since he's a really good debater and talker and pretty much just does anything when it comes out.
[03:29:40.806 --> 03:29:42.166]  It seems like it's trustworthy.
[03:29:42.867 --> 03:29:45.031]  But that's a feeling I get with Ted Cruz.
[03:29:45.512 --> 03:29:51.122]  I don't fully believe what he's saying, but he says it so professionally that I feel like I'm being duped.
[03:29:51.222 --> 03:29:53.647]  It's like a slick car salesman.
[03:29:55.757 --> 03:29:56.057]  I think so.
[03:30:13.178 --> 03:30:19.320]  And then he, you know, brings this whole thing and the next thing you know you're sitting there and you're like, wait why am I stopped at a kiosk talking to this random guy?
[03:30:19.660 --> 03:30:21.041]  The smooth talking, uh, got me!
[03:30:29.303 --> 03:30:57.464]  You know, we call him, he's a master debater, and I agree with you, and that's what I find frightening, and so yes, you know, when someone like Trump gets out and speaks, it's brash, it is not elegant at all, and he makes a fool of himself a lot of the times, but there you're kind of thinking, okay, well he's not polished, he's not reading off a teleprompter, he's not telling us everything that we want to hear, or everything that the establishment tells him he needs to say in order to get elected.
[03:30:57.904 --> 03:31:01.107]  And that's what I think is kind of sparked in people's minds.
[03:31:01.447 --> 03:31:10.394]  Just like when Jones was yelling there at the BBC and everyone was like, Oh my God, how dare he interrupt our tea time?
[03:31:10.755 --> 03:31:17.981]  And that's what Alex was saying, that those people are in such a trance that the only way that you can wake them up is to just
[03:31:18.601 --> 03:31:22.723]  Be wild and blow their mind rather than having a civilized debate.
[03:31:23.084 --> 03:31:26.466]  And that's why the guy was like, we're trying to have a civilized debate here.
[03:31:26.926 --> 03:31:32.109]  And that ended up being like the biggest spike in views that that show had had.
[03:31:32.649 --> 03:31:35.311]  I don't I don't dislike Donald Trump at the end of the day.
[03:31:35.331 --> 03:31:35.871]  I really don't.
[03:31:36.131 --> 03:31:40.114]  What it is is at the beginning, yes, you know, we're going into the whole election year.
[03:31:40.134 --> 03:31:42.235]  Donald Trump comes out of left field.
[03:31:42.635 --> 03:31:44.075]  He's hitting home runs.
[03:31:44.376 --> 03:31:45.796]  He's saying things that people want to hear.
[03:31:45.816 --> 03:31:47.877]  He's getting people energized for the first time.
[03:31:48.157 --> 03:31:50.377]  He's talking about, let's make America great again.
[03:31:50.657 --> 03:32:03.981]  You just see an entire movement of people who would never really even care because they've been so depressed from eight years or even more than eight years, 16 years of just complete and total craziness from, you know, to George, you know, to, uh,
[03:32:04.505 --> 03:32:07.787]  Bush presidencies and then two Obama presidencies.
[03:32:08.207 --> 03:32:11.929]  And now you've got this guy coming in, he's saying all the right things, and everyone's all behind it.
[03:32:12.290 --> 03:32:17.112]  You know, and I got emotional too, and I even called it back when he first even started thinking about possibly running.
[03:32:17.132 --> 03:32:18.994]  I was like, that guy could be the president.
[03:32:19.754 --> 03:32:28.199]  Based off of what he was saying, what he was doing, the fact that he could spark emotion in people, the way he could get conviction out of people that normally wouldn't even care about politics.
[03:32:28.587 --> 03:32:30.128]  I think that's a huge thing for Trump.
[03:32:30.148 --> 03:32:32.410]  But at the end of the day, I've got to put my emotions aside.
[03:32:32.771 --> 03:32:34.892]  I've got to put aside a lot of different things.
[03:32:35.193 --> 03:32:42.339]  And I need to sit down and think, you know what, like I said, Bush got it back to back, Obama got it back to back, and things haven't been good.
[03:32:42.359 --> 03:32:48.244]  At the end of the day, flashy words and cool slogans and walking around and having the celebrities come out there.
[03:32:48.823 --> 03:32:54.464]  You know, and Trump parading around and bragging about himself at every single time that he goes to an event.
[03:32:54.944 --> 03:32:55.904]  I'm starting to get sick of it.
[03:32:56.324 --> 03:33:02.485]  At the end of the day, I know that right around the corner, it's time for me to go to that election booth and check that mark beside a name.
[03:33:02.905 --> 03:33:05.286]  And I'm not quite convinced yet that it should be Donald Trump.
[03:33:05.766 --> 03:33:09.286]  But I do know Rand Paul comes in there and he brings in real issues.
[03:33:09.326 --> 03:33:09.987]  He talks about them.
[03:33:10.027 --> 03:33:15.548]  He brings things that I can actually agree with and I can look at and go, all right, he's got some plans.
[03:33:15.608 --> 03:33:18.148]  And I don't agree with every single thing that Rand Paul does.
[03:33:18.553 --> 03:33:23.395]  But at least when I look at him as a leader of the country, he has a plan laid out.
[03:33:24.196 --> 03:33:26.597]  Whereas Donald Trump goes, oh, we got a problem with that.
[03:33:27.057 --> 03:33:27.858]  Let's fix the vet.
[03:33:28.158 --> 03:33:28.358]  All right.
[03:33:28.398 --> 03:33:29.739]  Well, tell me how you're going to do it, Donald.
[03:33:30.239 --> 03:33:30.559]  Or hey.
[03:33:31.089 --> 03:33:32.409]  We've got a problem with immigration.
[03:33:32.429 --> 03:33:33.210]  Let's build a wall.
[03:33:33.270 --> 03:33:33.750]  Well, guess what?
[03:33:33.790 --> 03:33:35.030]  You can build a wall all day long.
[03:33:35.330 --> 03:33:36.071]  I've been to the border.
[03:33:36.271 --> 03:33:37.791]  They can climb over it and they can dig under it.
[03:33:37.911 --> 03:33:40.052]  El Chapo is very good at digging tunnels.
[03:33:40.372 --> 03:33:42.492]  Actually, I saw a documentary about how he does that.
[03:33:42.713 --> 03:33:49.595]  Yeah, you can build a wall, but now they have drones that can drop drugs and things, or there's plenty of tunnels.
[03:33:49.895 --> 03:33:54.496]  What Donald Trump needs to build right now is a true plan.
[03:33:55.036 --> 03:33:56.417]  Donald Trump needs to build a plan.
[03:33:56.437 --> 03:33:58.197]  He keeps talking about making America great again.
[03:33:58.437 --> 03:34:00.398]  Well, show us your plan on how you're going to do it.
[03:34:00.771 --> 03:34:03.958]  Stop just using talking points like there's a wall that needs to be built.
[03:34:04.740 --> 03:34:06.263]  Vets are not getting taken care of.
[03:34:06.926 --> 03:34:07.987]  They're trying to take our money.
[03:34:08.327 --> 03:34:09.548]  You know, they're trying to take our jobs.
[03:34:09.648 --> 03:34:10.348]  China's bad.
[03:34:10.368 --> 03:34:12.030]  I'm going to make Mexico build a wall.
[03:34:12.350 --> 03:34:14.591]  I mean, you're just rambling off talking points.
[03:34:14.932 --> 03:34:23.557]  I want to see a plan, and that's when, if he does actually come out and take the time and they write out a legitimate plan, then maybe I'll put my checkmark beside his name.
[03:34:23.577 --> 03:34:24.878]  But until then, I need to see it.
[03:34:24.938 --> 03:34:28.000]  I still have time to decide whether or not, which way I want to go.
[03:34:28.601 --> 03:34:30.682]  Thanks so much, Biggs.
[03:34:30.983 --> 03:34:31.783]  You can hang tight, Biggs.
[03:34:31.803 --> 03:34:34.165]  We want to go back to Richard now, because I know he's been waiting.
[03:34:35.934 --> 03:34:36.675]  Oh, Richard?
[03:34:36.735 --> 03:34:38.176]  No, I guess he's having some Skype issues.
[03:34:38.997 --> 03:34:39.258]  Okay.
[03:34:39.578 --> 03:34:40.439]  Alright, well, thank you Biggs.
[03:34:40.459 --> 03:34:41.480]  You can hang on if you'd like.
[03:34:41.600 --> 03:34:42.681]  Let's go back now to Kit.
[03:34:43.282 --> 03:34:49.328]  Kit, you want to get in the conversation as well, so we don't want to stay on this topic we've been talking about with Ted Cruz and all that.
[03:34:49.368 --> 03:34:50.849]  You're welcome to other topics if you have some.
[03:34:50.869 --> 03:34:52.951]  Yeah, one thing I want to point out is that
[03:34:54.215 --> 03:35:06.325]  Right when Donald Trump announced that he was going to do the debate and he was going to do this Wounded Warriors project, the New York Times I believe, they did a hit piece on Wounded Warriors saying it was a corrupt organization that skims from the top of this and that.
[03:35:07.126 --> 03:35:17.854]  Okay, regardless if that's true or not, A, the established media was attacking Wounded Warriors just because as a proxy attack Trump, and B,
[03:35:19.343 --> 03:35:33.948]  You know, even if all that's true, you know, one thing I do like is the fact that because Trump left the debate and he instead focused on this veteran thing, maybe more Americans now are going to focus more on the corruption in the VA.
[03:35:34.008 --> 03:35:44.351]  And, you know, it's kind of like he's taking over the narrative, moving it away from the media circus of Fox News presidential baits, you know, asking softball questions about fantasy football.
[03:35:44.792 --> 03:35:48.613]  Maybe more Americans now are going to pay a little bit more attention to the veterans and the VA system.
[03:35:49.153 --> 03:35:49.393]  Right.
[03:35:49.614 --> 03:35:52.296]  And I'm just speculating, but that would be my hope, my optimism.
[03:35:52.797 --> 03:36:10.275]  Right, and that is true because they're not really getting talked about in these past debates, and the veterans were a big issue a year or so ago because we learned about the big scandal there at the VA and how they're wasting all this money, and the veteran that Richard spoke with
[03:36:10.755 --> 03:36:11.316]  Absolutely, Leigh Ann.
[03:36:11.336 --> 03:36:13.818]  Let me jump in over here, over Kit and everybody else knowing I'm driving home.
[03:36:13.838 --> 03:36:15.319]  Number one, am I coming through to you?
[03:36:39.392 --> 03:36:40.473]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:36:40.613 --> 03:36:46.636]  All right, I'm going to wait 15 minutes like Trump did to peak interest before I bring a bunch of people out to mumble.
[03:36:47.156 --> 03:36:50.838]  My biggest criticism of the thing tonight, I think Trump took over dominance.
[03:36:51.218 --> 03:36:51.978]  Great idea.
[03:36:51.998 --> 03:36:53.619]  You know, art of the deal.
[03:36:53.639 --> 03:37:00.963]  Congratulations, Trump, was that he did have not weak speakers, but just a bunch of people out there like it was a pep rally or something.
[03:37:00.983 --> 03:37:02.424]  He should have been talking more about policy.
[03:37:02.484 --> 03:37:05.905]  So I'll take it from an A plus to like a B plus because of that.
[03:37:06.486 --> 03:37:07.186]  It's a big problem.
[03:37:07.768 --> 03:37:14.890]  But, when I was listening on the free iPhone app, just now, that's really key folks, free iPhone app at importwars.com.
[03:37:15.490 --> 03:37:21.651]  When I was listening, driving home to that, the local station was airing an ad over it, which is fine, that's their space to do it.
[03:37:22.551 --> 03:37:35.394]  I was listening to you, and he was making the point, the best point Biggs made tonight, because I wasn't getting where he was coming from earlier, is Trump needs to build a plan, not a wall, because we need
[03:37:36.172 --> 03:37:40.676]  Troops and surveillance are the key routes where things are coming over.
[03:37:40.796 --> 03:37:42.397]  And we need surveillance on our border.
[03:37:42.797 --> 03:37:48.842]  And we need to not have the government ship the illegals in and, you know, have JFK every day with planes coming in with no IDs coming in.
[03:37:48.862 --> 03:37:51.444]  The government's bringing in the radical Islamists.
[03:37:51.484 --> 03:37:52.765]  The government's opened the borders.
[03:37:53.225 --> 03:37:57.809]  And like Ron Paul said five years ago, the wall they want to build is for us.
[03:37:57.829 --> 03:37:58.809]  So it's hypocritical.
[03:37:58.889 --> 03:37:59.550]  It's ridiculous.
[03:37:59.570 --> 03:38:02.712]  And quite frankly, I don't care if women and kids come into the U.S.
[03:38:02.812 --> 03:38:03.333]  I don't like
[03:38:04.270 --> 03:38:07.251]  Every criminal worldwide, instead of criminals in the U.S.
[03:38:07.291 --> 03:38:17.353]  running to Mexico, you know, historically, now the criminals from the whole world, from China to Germany to Russia to Mexico, from Venezuela, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Chile, you know, come here.
[03:38:18.233 --> 03:38:19.213]  So that's the point.
[03:38:19.233 --> 03:38:27.495]  The globalists want to service all that and want to, you know, socialize all that, want to use the crime to roll out a police state, just like with the radical Islamic invaders.
[03:38:27.535 --> 03:38:28.415]  But here's the key.
[03:38:29.375 --> 03:38:29.555]  What?
[03:38:30.382 --> 03:38:38.268]  Joe Biggs said earlier, it's absolutely key, and I'm going to ask Paul Watson right now, I'm going to call him, leave him a message, he's asleep, it's like 5 in the morning, where he's asleep in London.
[03:38:38.849 --> 03:38:43.312]  The headline should be, Trump, we don't need a wall, we need a plan.
[03:38:43.853 --> 03:38:51.479]  A lot of what he says says I'm against political correctness, so the article starts out, hey, you've got a plan against political correctness for the First Amendment.
[03:38:51.959 --> 03:38:53.701]  You've got a plan to lower taxes, that's great.
[03:38:53.721 --> 03:38:55.202]  You've got a plan on your pro-Second Amendment.
[03:38:55.922 --> 03:38:57.644]  We need to hear a plan economically.
[03:38:58.334 --> 03:39:04.618]  Specifically on tariffs and trade and what you're going to do and what you're going to do on the border and what you're going to do with the VA.
[03:39:04.638 --> 03:39:08.079]  Because man, let me tell you, the VA is one of the most bloated bureaucracies.
[03:39:08.119 --> 03:39:13.082]  We're talking about close to $80,000 a year per veteran.
[03:39:13.623 --> 03:39:19.726]  It is the government using the love of veterans, the love of our families, the love of our heroes,
[03:39:20.635 --> 03:39:22.576]  Uh, to literally steal everything.
[03:39:22.656 --> 03:39:26.339]  I mean, that, that guest earlier saying, why was the media always building buildings?
[03:39:26.419 --> 03:39:30.942]  But, but, you know, but then tearing them down because it's all a scam for special interests.
[03:39:30.982 --> 03:39:34.364]  We need to, it's just like the Pentagon spends 1% on infantry.
[03:39:34.724 --> 03:39:40.748]  So they do 90% of the fighting and then we're paying a billion dollars for these joint strike fighters that aren't as good as an F-15.
[03:39:41.349 --> 03:39:42.149]  It's a scam.
[03:39:42.189 --> 03:39:43.310]  It's special interest.
[03:39:44.104 --> 03:39:44.564]  I think so.
[03:40:04.912 --> 03:40:07.272]  Because a wall saying Mexico will pay for it.
[03:40:07.552 --> 03:40:08.213]  Okay, I get it.
[03:40:08.253 --> 03:40:09.913]  You make them pay for it with a tariff or whatever.
[03:40:10.313 --> 03:40:10.653]  It's true.
[03:40:10.673 --> 03:40:13.894]  We have one-sided deals with tariff with Mexico.
[03:40:14.074 --> 03:40:16.214]  But not because the Mexicans are doing it to us.
[03:40:16.294 --> 03:40:21.675]  Our elite have deals with their al-hafiz to use their slave labor to leverage everybody out.
[03:40:22.175 --> 03:40:23.095]  So that's the bottom line.
[03:40:23.115 --> 03:40:24.376]  You guys got 20 minutes left.
[03:40:24.816 --> 03:40:26.056]  InfoWars.com.
[03:40:26.856 --> 03:40:32.337]  We overrid our main video and even audio feeds at InfoWars.com overriding the show today.
[03:40:33.400 --> 03:40:35.824]  Uh, which is what funds our whole operation, which is fine.
[03:40:36.866 --> 03:40:42.995]  But we're talking about $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 we've lost tonight just in bandwidth and then in cost of lost advertising.
[03:40:43.015 --> 03:40:48.164]  So supportinfowars.com, supportinfowarsstore.com, huge specials.
[03:40:52.034 --> 03:40:52.634]  We're good to go.
[03:41:18.300 --> 03:41:18.900]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:41:18.940 --> 03:41:19.980]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[03:41:20.020 --> 03:41:24.101]  Now, Joe Biggs, you were mentioned there in that segment by Alex.
[03:41:24.261 --> 03:41:25.981]  Did you have any comments on what he had to say there?
[03:41:27.142 --> 03:41:35.283]  Well, I mean, basically that's what I've been trying to get to the entire night, is, you know, sometimes it's hard for me to get out exactly what it is I want.
[03:41:35.563 --> 03:41:38.323]  Like I said, I don't dislike Donald Trump.
[03:41:38.964 --> 03:41:44.044]  I'm disappointed with the fact that he keeps talking about making America great again without a plan.
[03:41:44.425 --> 03:41:47.005]  And coming from a noncommissioned officer standpoint,
[03:41:47.475 --> 03:41:52.196]  Being in the military, being in combat, I can't just look at my soldiers and go, all right, we're going to kill the enemy.
[03:41:52.216 --> 03:41:53.277]  All right, let's go.
[03:41:53.897 --> 03:41:54.577]  And we walk off.
[03:41:54.837 --> 03:41:55.417]  Because guess what?
[03:41:55.437 --> 03:41:56.357]  We're all going to get shot up.
[03:41:56.697 --> 03:41:57.378]  We're going to get killed.
[03:41:57.398 --> 03:41:58.158]  We don't have a plan.
[03:41:58.518 --> 03:42:01.559]  You have to strategically talk to your people.
[03:42:01.579 --> 03:42:05.460]  So him running for president, he needs to talk to the American people, lay out a plan.
[03:42:05.960 --> 03:42:11.441]  So us, the people, we can go, OK, I think you're going to be good for this job.
[03:42:11.561 --> 03:42:12.582]  And you're going to get more people.
[03:42:12.602 --> 03:42:14.222]  Because I'll vote for him if I see a plan.
[03:42:14.716 --> 03:42:17.297]  I just don't see one yet, so that's why I'm still going to be skeptical.
[03:42:35.623 --> 03:42:42.307]  Like I said, I don't think Donald Trump is the scum of the earth, you know, or anything like that, similar to the way I feel about Megyn Kelly.
[03:42:42.347 --> 03:42:50.413]  But like I said, he has said some things that I don't agree with, but we can move on to that and talk about some of the other people because Donald Trump wasn't the only person we saw on the stage tonight.
[03:42:50.453 --> 03:42:55.276]  Of course, he was the big draw in his own private event, but maybe we could do a bit of a roundtable.
[03:42:55.296 --> 03:43:03.541]  I don't know if we could pipe Biggs and Kittens simultaneous, but I just want to go around and just see what everybody thought of the contenders that are out.
[03:43:03.701 --> 03:43:04.442]  Obviously, we talked about
[03:43:05.186 --> 03:43:05.747]  We're good to go.
[03:43:23.647 --> 03:43:32.017]  And so she's just attacking Hillary saying how she's a better woman and she actually loves her husband and if he had treated her the way Hillary's did, she would have left him long ago.
[03:43:32.097 --> 03:43:37.043]  So she's just playing the whole woman card the way she is trying to say Hillary is.
[03:43:37.123 --> 03:43:40.407]  So, I mean, get on out of there.
[03:43:41.108 --> 03:43:43.851]  Whoever's in her campaign and told her to do that is smart though.
[03:43:44.626 --> 03:43:51.552]  To focus that as a woman, being in that position as a married woman with a husband, to do that was ingenious.
[03:43:51.632 --> 03:43:58.237]  I mean, that was amazing to see her come out and attack Hillary like that and go, you know what, I know where my husband is, do you know where yours is?
[03:43:58.677 --> 03:44:10.767]  Well, yeah, but that's what I'm saying is that she still does that in every single debate, but I guess she's trying to say, I'm the candidate that's going to really take on Hillary, and I would love to see the two of them go at it on the debate stage, so.
[03:44:11.287 --> 03:44:15.310]  Well, if Hillary can get there on time and not be taking all these bathroom breaks and all that.
[03:44:15.850 --> 03:44:18.031]  Uh, Kit Daniels, are you still out there for us?
[03:44:18.451 --> 03:44:22.214]  Yeah, it's interesting you brought up Hillary's bathroom breaks.
[03:44:22.294 --> 03:44:26.476]  It's something Matt Drudge said back in October, is that she's not a contender.
[03:44:26.676 --> 03:44:31.359]  She's got so many health issues that nobody's pointing out.
[03:44:31.759 --> 03:44:35.842]  She's literally kind of like on Futurama, she's like one of those head in the jars.
[03:44:36.242 --> 03:44:36.502]  Yeah.
[03:44:36.522 --> 03:44:37.723]  That's how she is health-wise.
[03:44:38.795 --> 03:44:45.019]  So it's like, the establishment is trying to push her into presidency because she's very tied in very closely.
[03:44:45.059 --> 03:44:47.100]  George Soros, she gets her orders from CFR.
[03:44:47.140 --> 03:44:52.984]  She even admitted that once, that her office was just down the street from the CFR where she could get her orders.
[03:44:53.984 --> 03:45:04.231]  So, you know, they know she's on the same team, but she's A, extremely unhealthy, and B, what we're seeing right now is the global elite are
[03:45:05.618 --> 03:45:11.566]  They have an issue with her, with her personality, her narcissism, and all these other words I'm not going to use on air.
[03:45:12.569 --> 03:45:18.954]  So they have this whole Byzantine Civil War going on right now where some of them are literally trying to push her and Bill Clinton out of the air chute.
[03:45:19.234 --> 03:45:23.237]  Especially Obama, you know, he's always had a frosty relationship with the Clintons.
[03:45:23.977 --> 03:45:34.925]  And now they see their chance where she has this weakness and they can finally get rid of her for good, the Clinton dynasty for good, and move her out of the way and they can go in the vacuum and suck up the power.
[03:45:35.325 --> 03:45:41.550]  All I can see is Igor from Young Frankenstein when he's like Abby Normal and he looks at the brain in the jar.
[03:45:43.706 --> 03:45:48.329]  Now, Kit, did you write the article about Obama embracing Bernie Sanders in the White House?
[03:45:48.850 --> 03:45:49.070]  Yes, yes.
[03:45:49.090 --> 03:45:51.732]  Okay, so can you break that down for us about that new relationship?
[03:45:52.072 --> 03:46:04.380]  Yeah, basically, Obama, very unprecedented for a president, he invited the underdog Democrat candidate for a so-called informal meeting at the White House.
[03:46:05.140 --> 03:46:16.189]  Now, as far as I know, the last time he did that was back in 2009, where he made the unprecedented move to get a Justice Department employee into the White House for an informal meeting.
[03:46:16.229 --> 03:46:24.936]  Now, that sounds simple, but reality is, you have to go through so much bureaucracy to get a meeting with the President, because they got to do all these security clearances and whatnot.
[03:46:25.997 --> 03:46:27.959]  And this was just a career employee.
[03:46:27.999 --> 03:46:31.822]  This was like a nobody in the, you know, a cog in the machine.
[03:46:33.070 --> 03:46:40.077]  And yet he got this lady from the Justice Department into the White House and he had a meeting with her for several hours.
[03:46:40.858 --> 03:46:49.748]  And later on it turned out that he wanted her at the meeting because they were prodding her into becoming the head of the IRS probe on the Tea Party harassment.
[03:46:50.365 --> 03:47:06.063]  So yeah, so there's a president in which Obama will have informal meetings with people he wants to work with in the future, and he's already had a frosty relationship with Clinton, and then all of a sudden Bernie Sanders, that's been practically nothing in the media.
[03:47:06.083 --> 03:47:09.406]  The media's been ignoring him almost as much as Ron Paul back in 2012 and 2008.
[03:47:10.968 --> 03:47:19.292]  All of a sudden, he goes from being nobody to being in the Oval Office, you know, with Obama still behind the desk, you know, having this meeting.
[03:47:19.693 --> 03:47:21.273]  So that tells you a lot right there.
[03:47:21.734 --> 03:47:22.234]  Yeah, it does.
[03:47:22.534 --> 03:47:25.956]  Now, I want to get everybody's opinion on this, and whoever wants to chime in can chime in.
[03:47:25.976 --> 03:47:27.277]  If we can pull up that Drudge poll.
[03:47:28.977 --> 03:47:31.759]  Why the hell do they keep giving so much time to John Kasich?
[03:47:32.119 --> 03:47:33.980]  Anybody have any thoughts on that?
[03:47:34.640 --> 03:47:35.681]  I really do not know.
[03:47:36.001 --> 03:47:37.322]  I mean, I just do not know.
[03:47:38.346 --> 03:47:44.070]  Yeah, I feel bad for saying this, but... I don't know, I just remembered, I'll never forget that line, he came out and he's like, I don't even want to be here.
[03:47:44.090 --> 03:47:46.312]  The only reason I'm here is because my daughter wants me here.
[03:47:46.332 --> 03:47:47.372]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:47:48.133 --> 03:47:56.779]  And I'm like, alright, you got a guy who doesn't want to be here, so you're just giving him more air time, maybe hoping that he'll get so overwhelmed and be uncomfortable that maybe he won't show up again, I don't know.
[03:47:56.799 --> 03:47:58.560]  They're giving him way too much credit.
[03:47:58.868 --> 03:48:02.651]  I hate to admit this as a journalist, but I'm not even really that familiar with him.
[03:48:02.871 --> 03:48:06.614]  No, neither am I. I think it's safe to say that most people aren't.
[03:48:06.634 --> 03:48:19.683]  If we could put that poll back up so the viewers could see it, it's pretty evident by the Drudge poll that the majority of America isn't too familiar with John Kasich, but they keep pushing this guy out there, you know, like he's the prom queen or something.
[03:48:19.703 --> 03:48:20.964]  Like, you're gonna love this guy.
[03:48:21.324 --> 03:48:35.311]  What a difference a year makes, because a year ago, I did an article, I think it was in November, a little over a year ago, in which polls showed that Romney and Jeb Bush were one and two in the GOP polling for president.
[03:48:35.771 --> 03:48:36.732]  Romney's not even running.
[03:48:36.752 --> 03:48:37.332]  Right.
[03:48:38.313 --> 03:48:42.495]  And then Jeb Bush was like polling very highly in second place, and he's a nobody now.
[03:48:43.155 --> 03:48:49.818]  So, you know, it goes back to the whole what I was talking about earlier about the populist movement, and it's funny because I saw an article Kurt wrote
[03:48:51.069 --> 03:49:00.613]  From back in the day, today, in which he said that unless something drastic happens, it's more than likely we're going to see a Jeb Bush or even a Romney in the White House in 2016.
[03:49:00.693 --> 03:49:02.174]  Something drastic did happen.
[03:49:02.414 --> 03:49:19.501]  We have this populist movement, we have Donald Trump out of nowhere surging in the polls, and number two is Ted Cruz, an outsider who's, I'd say quasi-establishment, but at least his rhetoric is definitely not a establishment, it's very much libertarian.
[03:49:19.901 --> 03:49:25.311]  Well, what do you think, Kit, about the fact that there's also a populist movement on the other side with Bernie Sanders?
[03:49:26.132 --> 03:49:29.999]  Yeah, you know, I think it's all interrelated, is that...
[03:49:31.923 --> 03:49:40.127]  Yeah, Bernie Sanders has been compared in a lot of ways to Ron Paul in 2012, although ideology, they're complete opposites.
[03:49:40.167 --> 03:49:40.387]  Yes.
[03:49:40.867 --> 03:49:52.893]  But, you see, I think the whole Bernie Sanders even goes back to the whole Occupy Wall Street movement, where people are finally starting to notice that it's the big mega banks that are screwing up the world, the Federal Reserve.
[03:49:53.903 --> 03:49:57.207]  Yet, people are seeing the problems, but they don't know what the solution is.
[03:49:57.267 --> 03:50:11.463]  It goes back to even the Bundy Ranch thing where they see the problem with the BLM, but they think that starting a campfire at this wildlife refuge with guns going on air saying, you know, this is going to be a one-on-one Armageddon, you know, it's on, it's on.
[03:50:12.677 --> 03:50:16.560]  That's not going to get you anywhere because they've already lost some narrative in the media.
[03:50:16.881 --> 03:50:18.202]  They've already been demonized.
[03:50:18.682 --> 03:50:20.143]  And yeah, I agree with them.
[03:50:20.203 --> 03:50:31.673]  The BLM, I've even seen it before with the court documents showing that the BLM was, a federal judge actually said the BLM was engaged in conspiracy against ranchers to take all their land rights away.
[03:50:32.474 --> 03:50:38.158]  So the militia is right on that front, but they're wrong with the perception and how their
[03:50:39.218 --> 03:50:50.723]  Allowing themselves to be perceived by the media, because unlike the medieval ages, right now the government has control on people by deception and by public perception.
[03:50:51.443 --> 03:50:53.224]  Yes, a very good point there, Kit.
[03:50:53.304 --> 03:50:57.986]  Now, we've got just a few minutes left here, so I want to do a quick... Oh, Darren McBreen!
[03:50:58.266 --> 03:50:59.967]  Whoa, where did this guy come from?
[03:51:00.007 --> 03:51:02.208]  Kit and I, we're playing musical chairs right now.
[03:51:02.268 --> 03:51:06.670]  Okay, well Darren McBreen, you've heard the conversation here, go ahead and chime in and throw in your two cents.
[03:51:07.270 --> 03:51:09.592]  Well, I guess this will be my closing comment for the night.
[03:51:09.753 --> 03:51:13.596]  I think Donald Trump totally hijacked the debate tonight.
[03:51:13.697 --> 03:51:18.141]  And in the process, he got millions of dollars for the veterans in the process.
[03:51:19.002 --> 03:51:20.884]  And so I think that was very interesting.
[03:51:21.064 --> 03:51:23.466]  You know, we could start calling him maybe the GOP pirate.
[03:51:24.407 --> 03:51:24.688]  You know?
[03:51:24.948 --> 03:51:25.669]  The GOP pirate.
[03:51:26.249 --> 03:51:43.482]  But the conservative media in this country, and I've noticed they kind of have a bipolar view of Fox News right now, because a lot of them, they will still go to Fox, and they'll still tune into Fox for breaking news coverage, but they no longer trust the analysis, right?
[03:51:43.742 --> 03:51:44.643]  And for good reason.
[03:51:45.282 --> 03:51:50.426]  And a lot of the ultra-conservatives nowadays, they're tuning in, or they're going to Breitbart.
[03:51:50.727 --> 03:51:56.031]  You know, they're going to the Drudge Report, and they're going to yours truly, Infowars.com.
[03:51:56.291 --> 03:51:59.754]  And that's because we have become the mainstream news media.
[03:51:59.794 --> 03:52:06.059]  We are the voice of reason, and we've now become the voice of resistance, and the voice of the revolution.
[03:52:06.079 --> 03:52:09.242]  So I think this was a victory for us tonight.
[03:52:09.813 --> 03:52:10.693]  Very well said.
[03:52:11.213 --> 03:52:13.154]  Darren McBrain, thank you so much for your closing comment.
[03:52:13.174 --> 03:52:14.194]  I guess this will be a good time.
[03:52:14.214 --> 03:52:17.835]  We've got about nine minutes left to go around the table and get everybody's closing comment.
[03:52:18.435 --> 03:52:20.295]  So, let's go now to Joe Biggs.
[03:52:20.315 --> 03:52:23.716]  Joe Biggs, you've been waiting on the line for about one or two minutes.
[03:52:23.756 --> 03:52:24.676]  Give us your closing comment.
[03:52:26.697 --> 03:52:36.899]  Well, I hope everybody takes the time to check out that footage of the LaVoie Finicum and the standoff between himself and the FBI and Oregon State Troopers.
[03:52:37.429 --> 03:52:46.837]  It's definitely a very moving video to see something like that, because you've heard a lot of different scenarios of how people said they thought it played out.
[03:52:47.457 --> 03:53:03.130]  And I just want to encourage everyone to go watch it, see it for themselves, and, you know, hopefully this thing can come to a peaceful end, and we can also bring to the light the fact that the government is taking people's land, and that is something that's horrible, and we need to come together and
[03:53:03.942 --> 03:53:05.946]  Try to shed as much light on that as possible.
[03:53:06.046 --> 03:53:07.990]  Thank you from Joe in Oregon.
[03:53:08.571 --> 03:53:09.232]  Thank you, Joe.
[03:53:09.272 --> 03:53:10.635]  Thank you so much, Joe Biggs.
[03:53:11.196 --> 03:53:13.901]  Closing comment, Leigh Ann McAdoo, then we'll go to Kit Daniels.
[03:53:14.744 --> 03:53:16.546]  Well, you know, I agree.
[03:53:16.646 --> 03:53:27.755]  Obviously, we didn't watch too much of the debate tonight, and we saw what happened with Trump, where he was able to take a lot of the prestige of the debate away and take it over to his event.
[03:53:28.255 --> 03:53:32.839]  I do wish that he would have stepped up and answered some questions on policy.
[03:53:32.919 --> 03:53:33.780]  However, I get it.
[03:53:34.361 --> 03:53:42.568]  He had already decided that he was going to create an event for the veterans, so it wasn't about a counter-debate or something like that.
[03:53:43.308 --> 03:53:46.831]  However, I think that was, you know, I agree that took him down a few notches.
[03:53:47.711 --> 03:53:55.237]  But what I also got from this debate is that the establishment media doesn't hold the reins.
[03:53:55.297 --> 03:53:57.678]  They're not the holder of the ring anymore.
[03:53:58.279 --> 03:53:58.819]  Very good.
[03:53:58.839 --> 03:53:59.580]  Kit Daniels.
[03:54:00.134 --> 03:54:05.358]  Yeah, as cliche as it sounds, it's definitely the best of times and the worst of times.
[03:54:05.959 --> 03:54:16.047]  I mean, we see the government encroaching on all of our freedoms at all angles, but at the same time we see this populist revolt with people waking up from various ideologies.
[03:54:16.507 --> 03:54:26.556]  You know, it's not just this certain subset of libertarianism, but you've got conservatives, you've got even, like Leanne said, you've got some socialist Democrats that are, you know,
[03:54:27.256 --> 03:54:32.502]  Starting to finally ask questions and they're not supporting Hillary Clinton, they're supporting Bernie Sanders.
[03:54:33.243 --> 03:54:41.692]  So where I'm going with all of this is, is that you're seeing this mass awakening that's a very, uh, it's something you only see maybe 1,000, 2,000 years.
[03:54:42.392 --> 03:54:47.478]  So it's, it's very much an exciting times that we live in today is as dangerous as the times are now.
[03:54:47.498 --> 03:54:48.319]  Yeah.
[03:54:48.936 --> 03:54:50.056]  Very good, Kit Daniels.
[03:54:50.296 --> 03:54:54.557]  And I guess my closing comment would be, I know we talked a lot about Trump tonight.
[03:54:54.597 --> 03:54:56.778]  There are many other contenders in this race.
[03:54:57.438 --> 03:55:04.600]  Bernie Sanders, I've said before and I'll say again, had I been 17 years old when this race was going on, I may go for Bernie Sanders too.
[03:55:04.640 --> 03:55:10.041]  Because the thought of getting a bunch of freebies sounds good, but once you become an adult, you realize freebies aren't free.
[03:55:10.061 --> 03:55:11.762]  It changes your perception very quickly.
[03:55:12.182 --> 03:55:14.044]  Mrs. Clinton, I can go down the laundry list.
[03:55:14.064 --> 03:55:18.589]  I would encourage anybody who is skeptical of her, go watch the Larry Nichols interview.
[03:55:18.609 --> 03:55:19.891]  You can see many other things as well.
[03:55:20.251 --> 03:55:22.994]  Listen to the guys who fall on the ground in Benghazi as well.
[03:55:24.196 --> 03:55:26.578]  Going down the list, many other people, Chris Christie.
[03:55:27.139 --> 03:55:32.141]  While he is pro-gun in some aspects, you know, he pardoned a guy who was arrested on a bogus gun charge.
[03:55:32.461 --> 03:55:35.002]  He also does push some very authoritarian things.
[03:55:35.562 --> 03:55:38.063]  Wants to shoot down Russian jets, you know, like he's duck hunting.
[03:55:38.703 --> 03:55:39.523]  On and on, Jeb Bush.
[03:55:39.583 --> 03:55:43.684]  I think the guy's living off Dynasty, and I could go all the way down the line, but I don't have time.
[03:55:43.724 --> 03:55:45.545]  I'd rather spend the time talking to you, the viewer.
[03:55:46.025 --> 03:55:49.148]  Then we want to thank you for tuning in to the InfoWars Nightly News tonight.
[03:55:49.428 --> 03:55:58.317]  We also want to remind you of the great specials available in the InfoWars shop, where right now you can get DNA Force, our flagship product, for 25% off.
[03:55:58.717 --> 03:56:01.820]  This is our most advanced product at InfoWars Life.
[03:56:02.140 --> 03:56:03.502]  It contains Bio-PQQ.
[03:56:04.222 --> 03:56:13.107]  And it is loaded with the patented BioPQQ compound, which is backed by over 175 clinical studies by major respected researchers.
[03:56:13.548 --> 03:56:21.252]  It also has CoQ10, and it is known as one of the most powerful antioxidant products that can protect your health from free radicals.
[03:56:21.312 --> 03:56:26.535]  And it is essential to basic cell function and one of the primary building blocks of life.
[03:56:26.555 --> 03:56:32.959]  And you get all this right now in the InfoWars shop, not to mention the Hillary for Prison t-shirt, very popular if you go out to these debates.
[03:56:33.579 --> 03:56:35.100]  I'm not making them anymore.
[03:56:36.461 --> 03:56:38.723]  They're on limited supply, so you may get one or two.
[03:56:38.783 --> 03:56:48.511]  Also, we have the brand new ProGun t-shirts, the We The People Will Never Surrender shirts, all the things available, the Life Straws, the books, the DVDs, the hats, hoodies.
[03:56:48.571 --> 03:56:52.134]  Now we got the ProMax shower filters, all the great stuff.
[03:56:52.174 --> 03:56:54.976]  The InfoWars battery, if we can click on that battery.
[03:56:54.996 --> 03:56:56.938]  I actually bought one of these for my car.
[03:56:57.358 --> 03:57:02.262]  I think for the simple fact that you can jump your own car with this, that is worth the price of it.
[03:57:02.702 --> 03:57:03.863]  Just for that one simple reason.
[03:57:03.943 --> 03:57:06.305]  I've already had to jump my car three times this winter.
[03:57:06.325 --> 03:57:06.726]  Yeah.
[03:57:06.966 --> 03:57:08.647]  And I've had to wait for my neighbor to come.
[03:57:08.767 --> 03:57:09.308]  Oh, thank you.
[03:57:09.328 --> 03:57:10.068]  Wow, wow.
[03:57:10.108 --> 03:57:12.631]  Just so you talk of it, and it shall appear.
[03:57:12.791 --> 03:57:16.014]  Maybe we can hold it up and get a nice shot with Leanne McAdoo.
[03:57:16.574 --> 03:57:20.878]  I bought one of these things, and I also have some DNA for it, but I won't talk about the battery pack.
[03:57:21.638 --> 03:57:22.399]  Maybe we can open it up.
[03:57:23.100 --> 03:57:25.322]  And you can jump your own car with this.
[03:57:25.362 --> 03:57:26.863]  That alone is worth the price of it.
[03:57:27.043 --> 03:57:30.694]  I have had to wait three times for someone to come rescue me.
[03:57:30.794 --> 03:57:31.617]  You don't have to call AAA.
[03:57:31.637 --> 03:57:33.863]  You don't have to wake up your neighbor at 6 in the morning.
[03:57:33.883 --> 03:57:34.625]  You can pull out your own.
[03:57:35.458 --> 03:57:37.500]  Your own cables here and jump your own battery.
[03:57:37.540 --> 03:57:39.402]  Just charge it and it stays in the car and it's ready.
[03:57:39.442 --> 03:57:41.584]  I keep it in my car at all times, so I'm good to go.
[03:57:41.604 --> 03:57:45.528]  And luckily I haven't had to use it, but if I do... Cold weather makes your battery die.
[03:57:45.669 --> 03:57:50.013]  Yes, but especially if you live someplace up north, it's a very great product to have.
[03:57:50.093 --> 03:57:52.696]  So that's about it for our show tonight.
[03:57:52.736 --> 03:57:54.798]  We definitely thank you, the viewers, for joining us.
[03:57:54.878 --> 03:57:56.880]  I know it's been a very long broadcast day.
[03:57:56.900 --> 03:57:57.501]  They started at
[03:57:58.381 --> 03:57:58.641]  11 a.m.
[03:57:58.701 --> 03:58:00.802]  Central to 3 p.m.
[03:58:00.862 --> 03:58:02.562]  Came back 7 p.m.
[03:58:02.582 --> 03:58:04.303]  And now it's about 11 p.m.
[03:58:04.323 --> 03:58:05.883]  So the crew has had a very long day.
[03:58:06.204 --> 03:58:07.084]  Clap it up for the crew.
[03:58:07.624 --> 03:58:08.324]  Good job crew.
[03:58:08.384 --> 03:58:13.506]  Everybody in there from the day show to the nightly news crew to some of our side graphics people.
[03:58:13.546 --> 03:58:17.007]  At least now we did learn that Alex Jones likes big butts and he cannot lie.
[03:58:17.347 --> 03:58:17.567]  Yep.
[03:58:17.747 --> 03:58:19.168]  I think that was key information.
[03:58:19.188 --> 03:58:23.592]  That was key intel so you get to learn something about Alex as well as the rest of the crew.
[03:58:23.652 --> 03:58:34.840]  So signing off from the InfoWars.com studio, Jakari Jackson along with Leanne McAdoo, Joe Biggs, Alex Jones, Richard Reeves, Kit Daniels, Darren McBrain, did I forget anybody?
[03:58:35.321 --> 03:58:36.842]  The crew and especially you at home.
[03:58:37.603 --> 03:58:41.007]  Marcos Morales also had a cameo in today's broadcast.
[03:58:41.047 --> 03:58:46.453]  Thank you so much all you guys for watching and Alex Jones Show will be back tomorrow live 7 a.m.
[03:58:46.513 --> 03:58:48.956]  Central Time right here from Austin, Texas.
[03:58:48.976 --> 03:58:50.117]  7 a.m.
[03:59:08.820 --> 03:59:10.000]  Knockout is back.
[03:59:10.341 --> 03:59:21.444]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[03:59:21.844 --> 03:59:23.544]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:59:24.025 --> 03:59:24.745]  L-theanine,
[03:59:25.405 --> 03:59:33.146]  Hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[03:59:33.586 --> 03:59:35.307]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[03:59:35.887 --> 03:59:40.268]  It's the same price as leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece.
[03:59:40.728 --> 03:59:43.388]  It has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult.
[03:59:43.928 --> 03:59:45.768]  It's got the GABA.
[03:59:46.469 --> 03:59:50.169]  So it would probably cost $50 to take all this as separate pills.
[03:59:50.669 --> 03:59:50.789]  It's $19.95.
[03:59:51.529 --> 03:59:53.850]  You take one or two of these,
[03:59:54.930 --> 03:59:58.233]  And it just is really clean restful sleep is what the reviews are.
[03:59:58.573 --> 03:59:59.654]  It's what I've experienced.
[04:00:00.094 --> 04:00:02.476]  And it just synergistically puts everything in there.
[04:00:02.797 --> 04:00:03.758]  Infowarslife.com.
[04:00:03.798 --> 04:00:05.579]  That's infowarslife.com.
