[00:00:09.395 --> 00:00:27.046]  You're listening to an All4Worlds.com Frontline Report.
[00:00:27.126 --> 00:00:28.527]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.903 --> 00:00:32.243]  I don't know.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.543]  Now, the new Soros push is to say he's betraying people when there's not any real evidence of that.
[00:01:04.484 --> 00:01:10.347]  The real proof will be when the rubber meets the road coming up January 20th when he enters office to see what he actually starts doing.
[00:01:11.848 --> 00:01:15.850]  Securing our borders, cutting taxes, going after ISIS, things like that.
[00:01:18.112 --> 00:01:19.553]  Setting up fairer trade deals.
[00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:25.736]  And we have massive leverage because all these deals are one-sided via globalism to de-industrialize us.
[00:01:25.756 --> 00:01:26.557]  That's the admitted plan.
[00:01:28.137 --> 00:01:30.658]  So he's got such an enemy force arrayed against him.
[00:01:30.718 --> 00:01:35.400]  Hillary, who said she would accept the results, has now come out and joined the recount with Jill Stein.
[00:01:37.982 --> 00:01:41.363]  He's got such a force arrayed against him, I'm fully backing him until he gets into office.
[00:01:41.423 --> 00:01:49.127]  Then, if things go sideways, I have nothing but integrity, I will, sadly, be very painful, start exposing what's going on.
[00:01:49.207 --> 00:01:50.588]  But that's cart before the horse.
[00:01:51.482 --> 00:01:54.304]  Here's what we know, and there's so much today we're going to cover.
[00:01:54.324 --> 00:01:56.346]  This is probably one of the most important broadcasts ever.
[00:01:56.786 --> 00:01:59.829]  I tend to say that more and more because there's a quickening and acceleration happening.
[00:02:03.952 --> 00:02:10.497]  Jill Stein is calling for a recount in five states that are all battlegrounds Donald Trump won.
[00:02:12.158 --> 00:02:13.479]  That's completely transparent.
[00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.842]  Bev Harris and other top election fraud experts who are bipartisan.
[00:02:16.922 --> 00:02:17.643]  She's a liberal.
[00:02:17.983 --> 00:02:19.604]  Most her team are liberals, but they're real liberals.
[00:02:19.624 --> 00:02:20.545]  They just go with the facts are.
[00:02:22.486 --> 00:02:26.569]  They said all the evidence is showing fraud against Trump across the country.
[00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.711]  But his landslide was so big, he won.
[00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:31.974]  She's lately exposed that Al Gore was robbed.
[00:02:31.994 --> 00:02:32.414]  And you know what?
[00:02:32.434 --> 00:02:35.437]  I didn't like Al Gore, but I went with that because the evidence was there.
[00:02:35.497 --> 00:02:35.997]  I covered it.
[00:02:36.878 --> 00:02:37.859]  Al Gore got robbed.
[00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.062]  I don't know who'd be worse though, him or Bush.
[00:02:41.082 --> 00:02:42.343]  The point is, the facts are the facts.
[00:02:42.983 --> 00:02:44.224]  They tried to steal it from Trump.
[00:02:44.244 --> 00:02:47.787]  Now Trump, that doesn't want to sound like he's a sore winner and come out and say that.
[00:02:47.807 --> 00:02:49.349]  But I said weeks ago, he better do it.
[00:02:50.435 --> 00:02:54.859]  Because they're blaming him when she's only doing, he called it a scam to raise money and that's part of it.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.866]  No, it's a scam from Democratic Party donors to make Trump look illegitimate to cause a civil war in this country.
[00:03:02.886 --> 00:03:04.207]  And I said that last week.
[00:03:05.228 --> 00:03:08.090]  I said that Monday and Tuesday before I went to Thanksgiving.
[00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:10.212]  And now Fox News is saying that.
[00:03:11.113 --> 00:03:14.095]  And again, I just, I make that point because we're the trailblazers here.
[00:03:14.475 --> 00:03:16.017]  We'll say things that are obvious.
[00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.333]  Before other people will, because they want to go along with the establishment narrative, they think that's how they get ahead.
[00:03:23.413 --> 00:03:32.280]  Now, that said, Roger Stone's going to be popping in, in the second hour, and I'm not going to get into all the inside baseball, but believe me, it's very interesting.
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.721]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:03:34.782 --> 00:03:37.224]  Somebody has spent quite a bit of time with El Presidente.
[00:03:37.244 --> 00:03:41.727]  But we're going to get into the recount, Mitt Romney, what's really going on.
[00:03:42.207 --> 00:03:43.829]  I've talked to him hours the last few days.
[00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:46.251]  This is going to be important in the second hour.
[00:03:46.611 --> 00:03:47.772]  Former head of Trump's campaign.
[00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.192]  Kind of that wild card that Trump keeps under the table.
[00:03:57.233 --> 00:03:57.874]  Pun intended.
[00:03:57.934 --> 00:04:02.636]  Now that said, quite frankly all that news pales with what I'm going to come back with on the other side.
[00:04:03.817 --> 00:04:10.541]  We're one of the first groups in the WikiLeaks back in early November, the first few days of November,
[00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.834]  to expose the Satanism and the occult and the code words for pedophilia.
[00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:18.896]  These are admitted law enforcement code words that were being used in the emails.
[00:04:19.236 --> 00:04:20.738]  Did people accidentally use these?
[00:04:21.358 --> 00:04:25.442]  Did somebody in the administration set folks up and say, use these code words for something else?
[00:04:25.822 --> 00:04:26.803]  They're talking about something else?
[00:04:27.023 --> 00:04:27.824]  I mean, that might be it.
[00:04:27.844 --> 00:04:31.567]  I'm not making excuses for it, but this is a real radio broadcast and over 230 affiliates
[00:04:33.308 --> 00:04:37.891]  Way bigger than the BBC online, according to Quantcast and other major rating services.
[00:04:38.431 --> 00:04:41.613]  I'm just not going to go on the air like some Reddit poster can do.
[00:04:41.673 --> 00:04:46.917]  I'm not bashing Reddit posters, but, and just say this person is a pedophile or this person rapes children.
[00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:53.761]  So I've seen this criticism that we're not covering Pizzagate enough, even though we covered it every day.
[00:04:54.966 --> 00:04:56.948]  That's how little people on the internet just feel big.
[00:04:56.968 --> 00:04:59.430]  They just say, Jones never exposed the Federal Reserve's private.
[00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.955]  And I'll say this, I went back and looked at it more, because it's so sickening, I don't like to even, hard to look into it, and I've been busy with other big news.
[00:05:06.395 --> 00:05:09.638]  But it is big, and we got big breaking news on Pizzagate, so stay with us.
[00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:13.000]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[00:05:14.642 --> 00:05:20.326]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government, that I stopped working out.
[00:05:21.007 --> 00:05:23.169]  I was a total fitness nut.
[00:05:24.464 --> 00:05:24.924]  20 years ago.
[00:05:24.944 --> 00:05:28.066]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:29.306]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[00:05:29.346 --> 00:05:32.567]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[00:05:33.528 --> 00:05:33.868]  Or more.
[00:05:33.968 --> 00:05:35.829]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:37.870]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.331]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[00:05:41.411 --> 00:05:43.192]  It's actually scary.
[00:05:44.072 --> 00:05:54.157]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[00:05:55.158 --> 00:06:07.964]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support Infowars in our fight to promote human liberty and freedom.
[00:06:12.776 --> 00:06:15.801]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:06:16.382 --> 00:06:20.530]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:44.761 --> 00:06:51.365]  Hard to believe we're about to enter the final month of 2016 and old November is long in the tooth.
[00:06:51.405 --> 00:06:53.907]  It is the 27th day of November 2016.
[00:06:55.508 --> 00:06:56.929]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:59.550]  Thank you for joining us on this live Sunday edition.
[00:06:59.591 --> 00:07:02.572]  I'll be back tomorrow, Lord willing, 11 a.m.
[00:07:02.592 --> 00:07:03.233]  to 3 p.m.
[00:07:03.273 --> 00:07:05.794]  Central Standard Time with the weekday broadcast.
[00:07:05.834 --> 00:07:07.556]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[00:07:07.616 --> 00:07:07.936]  Eastern.
[00:07:07.976 --> 00:07:13.139]  You can find the free apps with video feeds and more at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:07:13.179 --> 00:07:14.460]  We also have a paid app for
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.564]  Exclusive videos, commentary, analysis and more.
[00:07:17.964 --> 00:07:22.389]  You'll also find it at Infowars.com forward slash app on your droids and iPhones.
[00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:26.052]  We also have the six, seven-year-old iPhone app.
[00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:27.232]  It's still super popular.
[00:07:27.272 --> 00:07:28.612]  Over two and a half million downloads.
[00:07:29.012 --> 00:07:31.013]  It just has a news feed and audio of the show.
[00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:33.293]  It's an oldie but a goodie and very popular.
[00:07:33.393 --> 00:07:36.134]  That's at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:07:36.934 --> 00:07:39.414]  Where you'll find the free video feeds, audio feeds and more.
[00:07:39.774 --> 00:07:46.716]  That way if you're listening to us on a local AM or FM station in your area, don't just spread the word to locals, which is very important in this fight against the globalists.
[00:07:47.256 --> 00:07:53.618]  But also call your friends, your neighbors, your family, people in other cities, other states, and say, listen to InfoWars.com.
[00:07:54.018 --> 00:07:58.499]  It's got Hillary and the globalists and the entire establishment hopping mad against it.
[00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:05.621]  Find out why they're trying to openly censor it at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:08:05.641 --> 00:08:08.582]  All right, let me tell you what's coming up today.
[00:08:09.083 --> 00:08:09.783]  There is a lot.
[00:08:10.103 --> 00:08:13.464]  We have the Democrats organized with Hillary trying to overturn
[00:08:14.537 --> 00:08:15.979]  The election of Donald J. Trump.
[00:08:16.619 --> 00:08:22.866]  I don't like to say, see, I told you so, but when I left Tuesday, at the end of the show, I said repeatedly, this is real.
[00:08:23.247 --> 00:08:24.188]  This is a real threat.
[00:08:24.789 --> 00:08:25.930]  The Democrats are behind it.
[00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.131]  Jordan Soros is behind it.
[00:08:28.032 --> 00:08:30.094]  They're going to try to overthrow the electors.
[00:08:30.155 --> 00:08:34.599]  We won't know till December 19th or the 20th if they're able to do it.
[00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:44.339]  And the electors who represent the voters of those states and who go then to vote in the Electoral College, they are being death-threaded.
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.564]  And I mean, you think juries in gangster trials get messed with.
[00:08:48.904 --> 00:08:51.967]  They are getting jacked with just huge.
[00:08:52.027 --> 00:08:55.391]  I've got mainstream news reporting this all over the country.
[00:08:55.791 --> 00:08:56.532]  So that's happening.
[00:08:57.799 --> 00:09:05.383]  So you think it's Byzantine with the primaries and the delegates and superdelegates in both parties?
[00:09:05.843 --> 00:09:09.425]  You think those rules are twisted like a barrel of snakes?
[00:09:10.066 --> 00:09:16.569]  Wait till you get into the electoral college and what's happening with the electors being death-threatened and physically attacked and guns pointed at them, you name it.
[00:09:16.609 --> 00:09:18.931]  I mean, this is a soft civil war.
[00:09:20.302 --> 00:09:29.782]  Going on between the dupes of the globalists and the people that are somewhat awake fighting for a future where at least we have fair trade deals, not one-sided screw jobs that enrich the globalists.
[00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.632]  So, we're going to break all this down today.
[00:09:34.093 --> 00:09:50.850]  We're now learning more that Obama, and the Trump folks have confirmed this, so has the Hillary folks, called Hillary that night at 1.30 Eastern, that's 12.30 Central, they still didn't announce for over an hour, and said, this is embarrassing, you're supposed to go out and concede.
[00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.033]  And then Hillary had to be sedated, she threw a big fit, and went crazy.
[00:09:55.054 --> 00:10:01.897]  The Obama folks coming out and telling The Hill and Bloomberg this confirms what we already knew from our sources.
[00:10:01.937 --> 00:10:03.218]  So that's triple confirmed now.
[00:10:03.538 --> 00:10:10.762]  And she went into a total tizzy because she knows Obama controlled, at that time and still for another 54 days, the
[00:10:14.045 --> 00:10:20.708]  Justice Department, the FBI, you name it, and he was saying, look, I'm not going to stand by you if you try to contest this and have a civil war at this point.
[00:10:21.148 --> 00:10:23.289]  So Obama basically flushed Hillary at that point.
[00:10:23.609 --> 00:10:24.869]  She attacked Podesta.
[00:10:25.369 --> 00:10:35.994]  She reportedly attacked others, had to be sedated, and then rolled out the next day looking completely drugged out of her mind for just a few minutes, and then disappeared for about a week and a half, then popped back up looking like she'd aged 15 years.
[00:10:36.614 --> 00:10:37.594]  Completely mentally ill.
[00:10:38.174 --> 00:10:39.455]  So we've got that to get into.
[00:10:42.349 --> 00:10:45.851]  We've got Trump to pressure foreign leaders to probe Clinton Foundation.
[00:10:46.431 --> 00:10:47.831]  That's on Infowars.com.
[00:10:48.011 --> 00:10:55.955]  I was told this on Thanksgiving by one of our sources that, let's just say, is extremely close to the President.
[00:10:56.455 --> 00:10:58.876]  And look, the Clintons have figured this out, so I can say this now.
[00:10:58.936 --> 00:11:02.678]  I was told this a few weeks ago, and I was told this again a few days ago.
[00:11:04.198 --> 00:11:04.859]  What was Tuesday?
[00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:06.259]  No, it was Thanksgiving.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.500]  So it's like four days ago.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.061]  I was told
[00:11:12.114 --> 00:11:16.057]  That, hey, of course Trump's not going to go after Hillary.
[00:11:16.458 --> 00:11:17.599]  That's not a president's job.
[00:11:17.659 --> 00:11:18.740]  It'll be his AG.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:26.006]  So what we had already been surmising is clearly the plan, and I was also told there's more than one way to skin a cat.
[00:11:26.106 --> 00:11:35.794]  Now, I didn't so much want to come out and shoot a video about this because it hadn't broken yet, and I almost don't want the other side to know this, even though I think they're smart enough to know Trump's playing possum with them.
[00:11:36.294 --> 00:11:37.755]  That's why they're trying to overthrow his election.
[00:11:37.775 --> 00:11:39.156]  That's why they've got death threats.
[00:11:39.757 --> 00:11:41.098]  The electors are being death-threatened.
[00:11:41.458 --> 00:11:51.947]  All hell is breaking loose while so many Libertarians and Constitutionalists and Conservatives and Nationalists and folks that just want a free market system, while we're all celebrating, folks?
[00:11:53.168 --> 00:11:56.090]  We're far from out of the woods, as I kept saying for the last two weeks.
[00:11:56.811 --> 00:11:57.892]  And I've now confirmed it.
[00:11:58.392 --> 00:12:00.174]  Now, the New York Post came out today.
[00:12:01.291 --> 00:12:19.041]  With the big headline, and they've talked to the insiders as well, and that indeed he is going to push for foreign governments to release the information on the foundation, just like we pressure the Swiss, it's all legal and lawful, to release info on Americans here that are doing illegal stuff, or have illegal Swiss bank accounts.
[00:12:19.898 --> 00:12:20.799]  Or questionable accounts?
[00:12:21.119 --> 00:12:22.600]  The Obamas did that some.
[00:12:22.961 --> 00:12:28.265]  He's going to legally and lawfully do that and that will destroy them because there's reportedly tens of millions.
[00:12:28.666 --> 00:12:31.488]  You don't think she sold out the whole world just for a couple hundred million, do you?
[00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:36.333]  So Trump to pressure foreign leaders to probe the Clinton Foundation.
[00:12:37.394 --> 00:12:40.376]  And notice this is all coming out now because Hillary reneged on her deal.
[00:12:41.017 --> 00:12:42.058]  There was word that
[00:12:43.052 --> 00:12:52.896]  Word came down, you're going to be left alone as long as you behave, because it'll be too embarrassing for the country, but you've got to step down and shut up now, or you know what else is about to come out in the WikiLeaks.
[00:12:53.897 --> 00:12:55.277]  Hillary didn't do it, folks.
[00:12:55.437 --> 00:13:05.182]  And I'm not saying that these behind-the-scenes conversations... It's like at 2.30 in the morning Central, 3.30 in the morning Eastern, when Trump finally walked out.
[00:13:06.038 --> 00:13:08.459]  Said, sorry folks, sorry you've been having to wait.
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.641]  It's been really complicated behind the scenes.
[00:13:11.381 --> 00:13:13.442]  It was Trump, Obama, Hillary.
[00:13:14.183 --> 00:13:17.104]  I mean, major deals going on.
[00:13:18.545 --> 00:13:19.566]  Major deals.
[00:13:19.586 --> 00:13:26.830]  Notice right around that time, or about a week and a half before Assange disappeared, he's never been seen or heard from since, except in one phone call that sounds fake.
[00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.592]  So, to say we're living in the middle of a spy thriller is...
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.380]  A joke.
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.161]  This is like a spy killer to the power of 10.
[00:13:34.221 --> 00:13:36.382]  This is over-the-top crazy town.
[00:13:36.723 --> 00:13:39.144]  That's all coming up in the second hour as well.
[00:13:40.465 --> 00:13:48.309]  Trump administration will pressure foreign states to probe Clinton Foundation.
[00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:50.370]  Another article.
[00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.392]  Trump supporters target George Soros over protests.
[00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:56.813]  So that's USA Today, New York Post, InfoWars.com.
[00:13:57.254 --> 00:13:59.435]  It's all up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:14:02.335 --> 00:14:03.095]  So we've got that.
[00:14:03.955 --> 00:14:10.417]  Then we've got a really important stack of news that deals with the latest salvos to censor free speech.
[00:14:11.777 --> 00:14:15.078]  They're never going to claim they're censoring or shutting down real journalists.
[00:14:15.218 --> 00:14:16.118]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:14:16.518 --> 00:14:18.678]  They're going to decide what real journalism is.
[00:14:19.779 --> 00:14:31.341]  And then now that the UN International Consortium has taken over the Internet, now this can be implemented and basically directed from the Hague.
[00:14:33.362 --> 00:14:43.430]  So we've got stacks of news from the New York Times, the Washington Post, RT, you name it, openly announcing, including Infowars.com, Drudge has been now added to the list.
[00:14:44.411 --> 00:14:53.118]  The most influential news portal in the world, hands down, breaking more stories than probably any other news institution out there of global import.
[00:14:53.438 --> 00:14:56.200]  They're now announcing, Drudge is fake, shut it down.
[00:14:57.501 --> 00:15:00.664]  In fact, the New Media Blacklist calls it Russian propaganda.
[00:15:01.727 --> 00:15:02.527]  Isn't that a joke?
[00:15:03.347 --> 00:15:05.808]  So, guess who put the new list out?
[00:15:05.868 --> 00:15:07.329]  The Washington Post.
[00:15:08.089 --> 00:15:10.349]  Owned by Mr. Bezos, a Democratic Party operative.
[00:15:10.589 --> 00:15:11.210]  But it gets worse.
[00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.270]  Guess where the list came from?
[00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:19.592]  They're fencing it, because they know they can get sued for torturous interference for this, to an unknown website and no one knows who owns it.
[00:15:19.872 --> 00:15:22.873]  So this professor backs down after a week of her fake list out there.
[00:15:22.893 --> 00:15:26.054]  Of course, the onion isn't on it.
[00:15:26.094 --> 00:15:26.914]  We are.
[00:15:27.014 --> 00:15:29.975]  Because we're so hardcore and so effective.
[00:15:31.229 --> 00:15:39.916]  That disappears, they take that down because that's fraud, and then now some imaginary group wanting to put their name on it is the new media chiefs.
[00:15:39.956 --> 00:15:41.477]  Can you say Southern Property Law Center?
[00:15:41.898 --> 00:15:43.219]  Can you say George Soros?
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.563]  So just some group, we don't know who, has a website and they just tell you what reality is.
[00:15:48.843 --> 00:15:51.125]  Now, you know, don't trust yourself, don't do your own research.
[00:15:51.445 --> 00:15:53.127]  They're going to tell you, so that's coming up.
[00:15:54.295 --> 00:15:55.395]  But first, let me return.
[00:15:55.415 --> 00:15:57.896]  Remember all the devil worship stuff that came out?
[00:15:57.996 --> 00:16:01.938]  All the bizarre blood drinking and weirdness and the Podesta emails and the spirit cooking?
[00:16:02.818 --> 00:16:08.020]  Well, now it's exploded the last few weeks into pizzagate, and there's shocking new developments straight ahead.
[00:16:09.861 --> 00:16:20.385]  If you ever wanted to live off the grid and produce your own clean energy in a silent, reliable way, this is a message you want to pay very close attention to.
[00:16:20.725 --> 00:16:23.826]  Thanks to a new development in solar generator technology,
[00:16:24.346 --> 00:16:31.350]  It's now possible for my listeners and viewers to produce their own source of emergency backup electricity.
[00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.751]  And even more importantly, it's now extremely affordable.
[00:16:35.152 --> 00:16:41.075]  Thanks to the guys at Solutions for Science, you can get one of these $6,000 solar generators for less than $1,500.
[00:16:43.536 --> 00:16:45.877]  We have these units at the office and at my home.
[00:16:46.237 --> 00:16:51.620]  I can run my sump pumps, my shortwave radios, all of my devices, and even keep our food from spoiling.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.823]  Go to powergridchaos.com and get 70% off for a limited time.
[00:16:57.184 --> 00:17:00.926]  Folks, there has never been a better time to get off the grid.
[00:17:01.266 --> 00:17:05.589]  It's going to be crucial in 2017, maybe even life-saving.
[00:17:05.889 --> 00:17:09.252]  Powergridchaos.com for 70% off.
[00:17:09.792 --> 00:17:20.139]  Jeff Sessions, a senator who's been on this program, an early Trump supporter, a believer particularly in sealing our borders.
[00:17:20.879 --> 00:17:30.925]  In the rule of law, the right man at justice in my opinion, the right man to proceed against the Clintons with a grand jury proceeding.
[00:17:31.445 --> 00:17:38.609]  I think he's reflective of the kind of men and women that you are going to get out of a Trump administration.
[00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:45.773]  Not men and women who are part of the Washington establishment, not parties of the two party
[00:17:46.873 --> 00:17:55.677]  Chelsea Clinton has reached out to members of the Trump family in a desperate plea not to have her parents prosecuted.
[00:17:55.697 --> 00:17:57.959]  Unfortunately, it does not work that way.
[00:17:58.039 --> 00:18:01.500]  We are a nation of laws, not a nation of men.
[00:18:02.161 --> 00:18:08.884]  And I think those in the Trump inner circle believe that this is a question that is best left to the grand jury.
[00:18:09.604 --> 00:18:15.868]  This is a question that is left not to politics, but to career prosecutors who can examine all the facts.
[00:18:16.368 --> 00:18:19.890]  There's a lot of alleged crimes here, 30 years of alleged crimes.
[00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:23.552]  As you know, Alex, there's no statute of limitations on treason.
[00:18:24.192 --> 00:18:38.740]  So perhaps selling missile targeting technology to the Chinese in return for campaign contributions, perhaps a special prosecutor should visit that issue and see exactly what happened.
[00:18:40.043 --> 00:18:44.445]  Meanwhile, my friends in Chappaqua tell me that Hillary Clinton is heavily sedated.
[00:18:44.725 --> 00:18:46.967]  We said at the time that her health was not good.
[00:18:47.027 --> 00:18:50.248]  We were told it was a conspiracy theory.
[00:18:50.708 --> 00:18:52.449]  Still don't believe her health is good.
[00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:59.313]  When you see her without the makeup, when you see her without the careful lighting, she does not look well.
[00:19:00.193 --> 00:19:03.555]  I have confirmed, as you did, that she threw a violent fit
[00:19:04.035 --> 00:19:09.299]  When she learned that she was not going to win, she was her usual foul mouth.
[00:19:09.319 --> 00:19:10.379]  She attacked Podesta, right?
[00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:21.957]  Greening obscenities at MOOC and Podesta over what could have been the worst presidential campaign in modern political history.
[00:19:22.017 --> 00:19:35.086]  Given the billion dollars plus that they had to spend, dwarfing the lousy $250,000 that Donald Trump spent, he's very proud of the fact that he spent less money
[00:19:35.746 --> 00:19:36.667]  Sure, of course.
[00:19:50.623 --> 00:20:09.308]  But when I look at the work of Charles Zortel, who's one of the most respected guys retired from Wall Street, a true financial expert, someone who has specialized in this area of nonprofits, the crimes there that have yet to be reported are extraordinary.
[00:20:13.529 --> 00:20:16.150]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:24.207 --> 00:20:25.708]  We are on the march.
[00:20:26.089 --> 00:20:28.510]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:20:29.231 --> 00:20:33.014]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:34.235 --> 00:20:38.478]  Okay, so this video was on the nightly news on Thanksgiving.
[00:20:38.518 --> 00:20:41.100]  John Baum, one of our investigative journalists, put it together.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.061]  It's five minutes long.
[00:20:42.081 --> 00:20:43.782]  I'm going to air it in about four minutes.
[00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:46.605]  And the headline is, Pizzagate is real.
[00:20:48.826 --> 00:20:50.428]  Only question is, exactly what is it?
[00:20:50.788 --> 00:20:53.210]  But something with codes is going on.
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:21:08.547]  Now, the New York Times and the Washington Post and every other major publication in the last few days has done stories basically saying, oh, it's part of the Russian propaganda fake news, claiming that there's all these code words in the Podesta emails.
[00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:17.951]  Well, if you go back to the first days of November, it was all over the news.
[00:21:20.134 --> 00:21:34.143]  The weird satanic rituals and stuff like, we'll have the kids for your entertainment ages 6, 7, and 8 in the hot tub waiting, and Obama wants $60,000 plus worth of hot dogs, and they're getting delivered.
[00:21:34.163 --> 00:21:39.267]  And then you go to law enforcement sex code documents, they're using all the key codes.
[00:21:39.787 --> 00:21:45.751]  The codes for kids, the codes for men, the codes for women, the codes for black people, the codes for Latinas.
[00:21:45.851 --> 00:21:47.212]  I mean, it's all there folks.
[00:21:48.053 --> 00:21:49.874]  Right out of FBI source manuals.
[00:21:51.455 --> 00:21:53.516]  And so we're one of the first groups to cover it.
[00:21:53.616 --> 00:21:57.078]  I just said, uh, could this be code for drug dealing?
[00:21:57.098 --> 00:21:58.479]  Could this be code for something else?
[00:21:58.819 --> 00:21:59.399]  I don't know.
[00:21:59.479 --> 00:22:02.541]  It's so horrible that I just said, what is this?
[00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:09.245]  It's like photos of kids at parties with images of people bleeding to death with women in satanic outfits, drinking blood.
[00:22:09.265 --> 00:22:13.247]  And, and, and then, you know, Podesta says, I'll see you at the spirit cooking dinner.
[00:22:13.287 --> 00:22:18.150]  And it's the most dark form of black magic that, that, that Alisher Crowley was involved in.
[00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:19.351]  So we covered it.
[00:22:20.151 --> 00:22:29.234]  And then every few days, we've had reporters cover it, new reports, I've talked about it, and I saw this meme, you know, Alex Jones isn't covering this, and I thought, you know, that really was a big area, thousands of emails.
[00:22:30.014 --> 00:22:30.774]  Where did that go?
[00:22:30.814 --> 00:22:40.197]  So I went back the last few days and looked at it and found out John Bowne had done a report I missed, and it was just so horrifying, I'm just like, I don't see how you see anything else watching this.
[00:22:40.757 --> 00:22:47.919]  For radio listeners, you'll hear it and say, okay, that sounds pretty bad, but when you look at the logos from law enforcement manuals,
[00:22:49.321 --> 00:22:52.122]  On how pedophiles traffic kids, the codes they use.
[00:22:52.142 --> 00:22:57.645]  And you see the very images on businesses connected to Podesta.
[00:22:57.665 --> 00:23:03.628]  And then you read Washington Post articles where the Podestas are talking about how they love to photograph the naked kids in their neighborhood.
[00:23:03.648 --> 00:23:09.550]  And then as soon as we report it, the Washington Post pulls the article the next day from like seven years ago.
[00:23:10.891 --> 00:23:12.872]  And then they just say, oh, it's fake news.
[00:23:12.932 --> 00:23:13.772]  Don't listen to it.
[00:23:14.793 --> 00:23:17.354]  Listen, I don't know what this is.
[00:23:21.348 --> 00:23:24.371]  It's like you're driving along in the country and you see some rotting dead animal in the ditch.
[00:23:24.431 --> 00:23:24.991]  Is that a cow?
[00:23:25.031 --> 00:23:25.592]  Is that a horse?
[00:23:25.612 --> 00:23:27.113]  There's like maggots all over it.
[00:23:27.133 --> 00:23:27.813]  It's something big.
[00:23:27.873 --> 00:23:28.494]  It's something dead.
[00:23:28.554 --> 00:23:29.715]  It's something stinks really bad.
[00:23:31.597 --> 00:23:34.359]  So, fearing yet another witch hunt, Reddit bans it.
[00:23:34.399 --> 00:23:38.582]  And so I went to see how about Reddit was censoring and found Alex Jones was in there.
[00:23:38.642 --> 00:23:40.224]  Alex Jones won't cover this either.
[00:23:40.844 --> 00:23:42.786]  Well no, I'll cover it responsibly.
[00:23:43.806 --> 00:23:46.528]  Because there's thousands of these emails.
[00:23:46.608 --> 00:23:47.929]  Some of them may be innocuous.
[00:23:48.029 --> 00:23:49.550]  I'm sure some of the folks are innocent.
[00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:53.892]  Or did they give them code words to use for politics, knowing it was a setup?
[00:23:54.112 --> 00:23:55.253]  I'm not giving them a way out.
[00:23:55.453 --> 00:24:04.178]  I'm just saying, man, when you go on air and you point fingers at people and say they're trafficking kids, you better have your act together.
[00:24:04.198 --> 00:24:06.220]  Because listen, we have due process in this country.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:13.044]  I'm drawing major attention to this, but I'm not somebody on an email or anonymously commenting.
[00:24:13.905 --> 00:24:20.247]  We have, according to Quantcast and other major rating services, the biggest radio show in the world now.
[00:24:21.807 --> 00:24:22.307]  Hands down.
[00:24:23.488 --> 00:24:23.968]  Hands down.
[00:24:24.308 --> 00:24:27.289]  Infowars.com alone is 126 on the World Wide Web.
[00:24:27.589 --> 00:24:29.049]  Way bigger than BBC.com.
[00:24:29.089 --> 00:24:30.389]  Way bigger than NewYorkTimes.com.
[00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:32.110]  Only thing bigger is Drudge in news.
[00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:32.530]  Drudge.
[00:24:36.331 --> 00:24:37.812]  Now, that's a responsibility.
[00:24:38.172 --> 00:24:42.133]  Now, that said, I'm not responding to this because a few trolls say, hey, you're not covering it.
[00:24:42.433 --> 00:24:43.214]  We have covered it.
[00:24:43.914 --> 00:24:46.475]  Drudge carried our big story about spirit cooking and the occult stuff.
[00:24:46.515 --> 00:24:48.415]  It was the biggest story on the web for two days.
[00:24:48.455 --> 00:24:50.996]  We had like six million readers on our website alone.
[00:24:51.056 --> 00:24:51.937]  Everyone else copied it.
[00:24:52.357 --> 00:24:53.657]  I can't even tell you how big it is.
[00:24:55.118 --> 00:24:56.318]  Trump asked me, how big is your audience?
[00:24:56.338 --> 00:24:57.839]  I said, I can't tell you, President-elect.
[00:24:58.579 --> 00:25:02.561]  Because, you know, maybe you have an article with six million readers, one of the biggest in a month, but everybody else copies it.
[00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:03.241]  We don't know, sir.
[00:25:05.503 --> 00:25:08.984]  You know, I'm going to keep talking until we come back to the next segment because it'll take me some time to go over all this.
[00:25:09.044 --> 00:25:13.525]  The point is, this is so dangerous, so big, so important.
[00:25:13.565 --> 00:25:20.367]  We shouldn't half-ass this and then not get it right so people that are involved in whatever it is don't get in trouble.
[00:25:20.908 --> 00:25:21.928]  Because let me tell you something.
[00:25:23.447 --> 00:25:24.868]  I got caught up in the campaign.
[00:25:24.888 --> 00:25:27.530]  I get caught up in Wikileaks and Where's Assange.
[00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:35.015]  I get caught up in all these talk of wars and the economy and who is Trump going to appoint and trying to just get tax cuts for Americans.
[00:25:35.616 --> 00:25:39.518]  And so I kind of have my reporters covering Pizzagate, and I've mentioned it some.
[00:25:40.499 --> 00:25:43.782]  But you know, quite frankly, I just instinctively shy away from stuff like this.
[00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:49.854]  I'll be watching COTV and flip to the channels, we'll have some special on pedophiles, and I just keep flipping.
[00:25:50.234 --> 00:25:52.016]  Or Jeffrey Dahmer, man, I'm not into this stuff.
[00:25:52.577 --> 00:26:04.207]  But yes, I have a responsibility to cover it, and yes, it's important, and yes, quite frankly, now that I've looked into more of the HUMET indigenous research of just millions of people, it's horrible.
[00:26:05.248 --> 00:26:07.891]  And I couldn't sleep last night, and
[00:26:10.834 --> 00:26:11.815]  You know, people want me to look into it.
[00:26:11.855 --> 00:26:15.317]  I may just have to take off a week and just only research this and actually go to where these places are and stuff.
[00:26:15.837 --> 00:26:18.339]  In fact, I'm looking at it on a plane.
[00:26:18.559 --> 00:26:20.120]  It's just like Bohemian Grove and stuff.
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.441]  I can't just say something and not see it for myself.
[00:26:22.941 --> 00:26:24.082]  They go to these pizza places.
[00:26:24.102 --> 00:26:25.763]  There's like satanic art everywhere.
[00:26:26.824 --> 00:26:29.966]  There's art of these people where they're shoving
[00:26:31.238 --> 00:26:33.300]  Children into women's vaginas.
[00:26:33.381 --> 00:26:42.391]  I can't even say this stuff on air I mean, you know something's go and then they have rock bands that come play there that talk about their preference being kids and stuff You know, I don't man.
[00:26:42.451 --> 00:26:43.372]  I'm telling you man.
[00:26:43.932 --> 00:26:48.618]  I like spent Five hours yesterday looking at this and I feel dirty right now.
[00:26:48.798 --> 00:26:52.442]  I mean I feel spiritually raped and
[00:26:56.502 --> 00:27:00.644]  Listen, I'm not bitching and I'm not complaining, but I just can't do this this hard anymore, okay?
[00:27:01.324 --> 00:27:04.405]  I just cannot continue to look at Hillary and these people all the time.
[00:27:04.446 --> 00:27:05.406]  I just can't do it, okay?
[00:27:06.406 --> 00:27:13.850]  You know, they say cops get screwed up for months when they find a cellar full of dead kids or, you know, come in and they see a dead toddler, you know, that snorted a bunch of cocaine.
[00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:21.033]  I've got a friend who's an EMT and he did it for like eight years, he finally had to quit because it was just like the sixth or seventh dead kid you see, you know, you want to kill their parents, you know?
[00:27:22.702 --> 00:27:24.364]  A pit bull kills somebody's three-year-old.
[00:27:24.384 --> 00:27:27.086]  You go to the house, there's a freaking dead kid, you want to kill the people.
[00:27:27.446 --> 00:27:28.868]  That's why I couldn't have that job.
[00:27:28.948 --> 00:27:29.268]  I get it.
[00:27:29.508 --> 00:27:31.130]  I look at this stuff and I can't handle it.
[00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:34.833]  I want to buy airplane tickets.
[00:27:35.553 --> 00:27:37.976]  But get this through your damn head, I'm not covering any of this up.
[00:27:37.996 --> 00:27:39.017]  I never cover anything up.
[00:27:39.817 --> 00:27:44.081]  There's just so much evil, I'm not trying to drink Lake Superior through a freaking pixie straw.
[00:27:44.341 --> 00:27:46.003]  And listen, I can't do it anymore.
[00:27:48.257 --> 00:27:51.619]  And then I start thinking before the show, you know, I didn't even, I'm not even doing this justice.
[00:27:51.719 --> 00:28:16.616]  There are thousands of mainstream news articles in England with Jimmy Savelle and the royal family and little kids they dig up on their estates and his torture dungeons and him raping dead bodies of kids and slitting throats of kids in front of the Prime Minister and devil worship and they say it's national security in the UK and they can't even go there because it's so big and then the Catholic Church and then Boys Town and then Penn State, Jerry Sandusty raping little kids in the field house
[00:28:18.453 --> 00:28:26.798]  On Tuesday mornings, Saturday mornings, Sunday afternoons, field houses, when I played high school ball, were like airports during the day.
[00:28:26.818 --> 00:28:32.521]  A frickin' college field house, I've been in one once, was incredibly busy during the week.
[00:28:32.981 --> 00:28:35.242]  I had friends that played at UT that I went to high school with.
[00:28:37.423 --> 00:28:39.424]  They went to UT and invited me to see the field house once.
[00:28:39.464 --> 00:28:40.285]  It was just the same thing.
[00:28:41.707 --> 00:28:45.430]  Let me tell ya, he ran a foundation that was supplying kids to a whole bunch of people, and I just don't get it.
[00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:46.831]  I mean, I don't get it, but I get it.
[00:28:46.871 --> 00:28:49.112]  They're vampires that want to feed on the energy of kids.
[00:28:49.172 --> 00:28:50.933]  Is everybody in these thousands of emails guilty?
[00:28:51.213 --> 00:28:51.374]  No.
[00:28:52.474 --> 00:28:55.076]  That's why I try to read these thousands of emails, and it's so sick.
[00:28:55.356 --> 00:28:58.478]  Oh, I love the sauce on the hot dogs.
[00:28:58.638 --> 00:28:59.399]  Oh, God, yes.
[00:28:59.679 --> 00:29:02.821]  Obama wants $60,000-plus in hot dogs delivered right now.
[00:29:03.081 --> 00:29:03.962]  That's a lot of hot dogs.
[00:29:04.042 --> 00:29:05.043]  Oh, these are good hot dogs.
[00:29:05.143 --> 00:29:07.024]  I'm craving, sucking on hot dogs.
[00:29:07.084 --> 00:29:08.005]  It's like, what the hell?
[00:29:15.875 --> 00:29:19.677]  I don't care if he has goblin guides to go into Washington.
[00:29:20.037 --> 00:29:21.698]  I don't care if he gets goblin guts on him.
[00:29:22.498 --> 00:29:27.161]  But if he catches kissing goblins, or in bed with a goblin, that's a problem.
[00:29:27.181 --> 00:29:28.361]  Or what if he marries a goblin?
[00:29:28.401 --> 00:29:29.642]  What if he has babies with a goblin?
[00:29:29.782 --> 00:29:31.583]  I mean, that would be what Hillary did.
[00:29:33.727 --> 00:29:34.868]  No, I mean, that's the point.
[00:29:34.908 --> 00:29:39.330]  He's gonna be around a lot of goblins, but he just has to avoid becoming a goblin himself.
[00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:51.395]  The contract with America that Trump posted, you know, before the election, before the process even took place, most of the things in that contract for America can't even begin to take place until he actually takes office.
[00:29:51.895 --> 00:29:52.976]  So, for now, what is it?
[00:29:53.036 --> 00:29:55.937]  Less than a week after he's actually president-elect.
[00:29:56.477 --> 00:30:00.158]  For people to be saying that he's backtracking on everything he said is ridiculous.
[00:30:00.558 --> 00:30:05.579]  Of course the language is going to be more conciliatory than it was in the lead up to the election.
[00:30:05.999 --> 00:30:12.780]  Because you've got thousands of maniacal Hillary supporters out on the streets rioting and attacking people.
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:17.321]  The empowered alt-right trolls have created a cesspit on Twitter.
[00:30:17.921 --> 00:30:18.261]  Oh really?
[00:30:18.301 --> 00:30:23.722]  That's funny because whenever I go on Twitter it's leftists threatening to assassinate Donald Trump.
[00:30:24.342 --> 00:30:25.943]  We've posted those tweets many times.
[00:30:26.304 --> 00:30:30.306]  In fact, I've just made a video, which is literally six minutes solid.
[00:30:30.706 --> 00:30:36.550]  Most of it is death threats posted by leftists on Twitter, threatening to assassinate Donald Trump.
[00:30:37.031 --> 00:30:53.602]  So the only people, yeah, you can have racists in the alt-right, but the only people who've actually made Twitter a cesspit, and in fact now Twitter has increased its censorship because of that, the only people who have made Twitter a cesspit is leftists with their violent, hateful, racist threats, which they now specialize in.
[00:30:54.362 --> 00:30:57.966]  But this was the original quote on this, um, Mashable article.
[00:30:58.687 --> 00:31:09.877]  They said, Paul Joseph Watson, the editor-at-large of conspiracy theorist website InfoWars, who has a Twitter following of 345,000 users, it's actually 357,000, he can't even count.
[00:31:10.198 --> 00:31:13.181]  This idiot who wrote this article, what's his name?
[00:31:13.421 --> 00:31:14.062]  Let's get his name.
[00:31:14.322 --> 00:31:17.345]  Colin Daylider, can't even count for one.
[00:31:18.291 --> 00:31:24.819]  Who has a Twitter following of wrong amount of Twitter users, advocated for mass murder in the aftermath of the election.
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:33.109]  His proof that I advocated for mass murder was me posting a tweet by somebody else who was concerned about mass murder.
[00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:35.212]  I said, look, this is silly.
[00:31:35.832 --> 00:31:37.934]  Donald Trump is going to gas disabled people.
[00:31:38.474 --> 00:31:39.575]  Obviously, a joke.
[00:31:39.955 --> 00:31:42.237]  He's not gonna gas disabled people.
[00:31:42.257 --> 00:31:45.920]  The original tweet was a concern against mass murder.
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:52.125]  Yet they used it to say that I was encouraging, I was advocating mass murder.
[00:31:52.505 --> 00:31:54.526]  This is why no one trusts the mainstream media.
[00:31:54.807 --> 00:31:55.807]  This is why you've lost.
[00:31:56.088 --> 00:31:57.589]  This is why your narrative is failing.
[00:31:57.849 --> 00:31:59.490]  This is why you're going out of business.
[00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:00.671]  Because you lie.
[00:32:00.951 --> 00:32:01.612]  You deceive.
[00:32:09.295 --> 00:32:19.357]  Well, Black Friday Week has basically come and gone, but we're going to have the specials for one more day, where there was a huge special each day, like 50% off on Colloidal Silver at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:19.437 --> 00:32:25.759]  Now, all the specials that were one day only are back on this one day only, with all the specials together.
[00:32:25.779 --> 00:32:34.441]  So if you missed out on any of the specials, missed out on a chance to help fund the InfoWar, the final day of Black Friday Week at InfoWarstore.com or InfoWarslife.com,
[00:32:35.021 --> 00:32:42.104]  And again, thank you for funding the True Tip of the Spear and the fight for human liberty.
[00:32:42.324 --> 00:32:48.746]  We could not have done it without you, and I want to salute you for your support, your prayers, the action you've taken.
[00:32:49.406 --> 00:32:53.648]  Every race, color, and creed, we are all red-blooded humans together, and I love you.
[00:32:54.248 --> 00:32:56.169]  And from myself and my family to yours,
[00:32:57.149 --> 00:33:06.594]  I pledge on the eternal altar of God, absolute resistance over every form of tyranny, over the mind of men, to paraphrase Thomas Jefferson.
[00:33:06.854 --> 00:33:08.534]  You've got my commitment!
[00:33:12.977 --> 00:33:19.059]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:23.582 --> 00:33:24.142]  The answer...
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.500]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:33.121]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:49.093 --> 00:33:59.615]  Is they go after our children, and history shows that every major elite in history, once it became corrupt, set up a priesthood that sacrificed children to dark gods.
[00:34:00.115 --> 00:34:01.856]  And that is still going on today.
[00:34:03.276 --> 00:34:06.397]  Now, I want to be clear, not everybody in the WikiLeaks is involved in this, clearly.
[00:34:07.397 --> 00:34:13.238]  You have to go investigate it for yourself, but I will warn you, this story that's been the biggest thing on the internet for several weeks,
[00:34:15.299 --> 00:34:19.924]  Pizzagate, as it's called, is a rabbit hole that is horrifying to go down.
[00:34:19.984 --> 00:34:26.872]  Now, if you're a radio listener, this is a powerful video, but I've had it reposted because, again, he finished it, I guess, on Wednesday.
[00:34:26.892 --> 00:34:30.497]  It went out Thursday on the nightly news that was taped the day before.
[00:34:30.517 --> 00:34:32.980]  This is on Infowars.com.
[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:33.881]  Pizzagate is real.
[00:34:34.804 --> 00:34:37.205]  The only question is, what exactly is it?
[00:34:37.785 --> 00:34:46.268]  Because I'd said, man, I hope this is drug-dealing code word or something, or, you know, maybe they got the wrong manual, because this is, the FBI says this is, this is pedophilia manuals.
[00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:50.029]  These are the terms they use, and then here's the New York Times.
[00:34:50.410 --> 00:34:54.071]  Fake news onslaught targets pizzeria as nest of child traffickers.
[00:34:54.851 --> 00:34:57.072]  Hey, I don't know why the pizzeria and the one down the street
[00:34:58.479 --> 00:34:59.899]  Have symbols of the FBI dossier.
[00:34:59.919 --> 00:35:01.480]  I don't know why there's devil worship art on the walls.
[00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:02.820]  I don't know why it's connected to Podesta.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:08.061]  I don't know why they got rock singers there talking about, you know, going after kids or whatever.
[00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:09.601]  This is what's going on, though.
[00:35:11.662 --> 00:35:13.782]  And so maybe it's just some genre they picked up.
[00:35:13.802 --> 00:35:14.682]  They don't know what they're involved in.
[00:35:14.783 --> 00:35:15.863]  I'm not accusing them of anything.
[00:35:19.323 --> 00:35:22.484]  The little... I mean, it's not like they look like little piggy people or anything.
[00:35:22.504 --> 00:35:25.885]  Not like they fit all the cliches or anything when you go to the...
[00:35:27.093 --> 00:35:40.278]  Just like nice people to me, but the point is, is that this is tied into Podesta with thousands of emails with, we're gonna have the six-year-old, the seven-year-old, and eight-year-old in the hot tub for your entertainment out at the ranch house.
[00:35:40.858 --> 00:35:45.200]  They can be a little persnickety, but they are also willing and enjoy it.
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.461]  I mean, there's thousands of these.
[00:35:47.481 --> 00:35:49.982]  You're reading it going, what the hell is this?
[00:35:51.004 --> 00:35:57.266]  And you start reading it, there's thousands and thousands and thousands, and you know you're reading something real bad.
[00:35:57.286 --> 00:36:01.908]  Oh, I'll see you at the feast tonight.
[00:36:01.928 --> 00:36:03.789]  Oh, we'll have lots of blood and semen.
[00:36:03.909 --> 00:36:04.449]  Oh, good.
[00:36:04.469 --> 00:36:12.132]  And then they have, like, Time Magazine worshipping this high priestess the week after we exposed her about it in the news, all this PR, like, oh, we'll show them.
[00:36:12.332 --> 00:36:13.732]  They're attacking our high priestesses.
[00:36:13.752 --> 00:36:17.834]  We'll just put them in the news better, like, we're all upstanding and out in the open and good people.
[00:36:19.855 --> 00:36:21.336]  Look, I've been careful about all this.
[00:36:21.356 --> 00:36:22.297]  This is Lawsuit City.
[00:36:22.337 --> 00:36:23.918]  I don't know what the hell's going on with these people.
[00:36:24.258 --> 00:36:29.061]  I know straight-up devil worship when I see it, and find quotes of her saying it's real when she does it privately.
[00:36:29.081 --> 00:36:32.303]  Including her Ask Me Anything Reddit accounts.
[00:36:32.683 --> 00:36:34.925]  I mean, I know real Baphomet worship when I see it, but...
[00:36:37.076 --> 00:36:37.917]  Thousands of emails?
[00:36:37.977 --> 00:36:39.679]  I'm not ready to accuse these people of this.
[00:36:39.979 --> 00:36:41.781]  It's up to you to research it for yourself.
[00:36:41.821 --> 00:36:46.986]  But you've got to go to InfoWars.com and actually see the photos and videos inside these places.
[00:36:47.006 --> 00:36:48.888]  You've got to see their menus.
[00:36:49.909 --> 00:36:52.171]  You've got to see it all, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:52.451 --> 00:36:56.455]  And then you've got to see the FBI law enforcement manuals showing the code words that are used.
[00:36:56.495 --> 00:36:57.716]  And by the way, I didn't just believe this.
[00:36:58.277 --> 00:37:00.299]  I went to the FBI site and I went and looked it all up.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.761]  People ask, well, why weren't you on this earlier?
[00:37:02.841 --> 00:37:03.962]  We were on it from the beginning.
[00:37:04.022 --> 00:37:09.306]  We've been on it the last couple weeks since the election, but we're fighting on hundreds of fronts here.
[00:37:10.807 --> 00:37:11.968]  Let's go ahead and go to the report.
[00:37:12.028 --> 00:37:12.889]  Pizzagate is real.
[00:37:13.669 --> 00:37:14.930]  The question is, how real is it?
[00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.451]  What is it?
[00:37:15.511 --> 00:37:16.331]  Something's going on.
[00:37:16.431 --> 00:37:17.532]  Something's being covered up.
[00:37:17.612 --> 00:37:18.593]  It needs to be investigated.
[00:37:18.613 --> 00:37:20.014]  You just call it fake news.
[00:37:20.535 --> 00:37:21.615]  These are real WikiLeaks.
[00:37:21.675 --> 00:37:23.036]  This is real stuff going on.
[00:37:23.076 --> 00:37:23.417]  Here it is.
[00:37:24.187 --> 00:37:27.872]  A warning to viewers, the following images are disturbing.
[00:37:28.112 --> 00:37:39.087]  This all began after WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange released hundreds of thousands of secret documents detailing a backstabbing Clinton Foundation, but it now appears the real
[00:37:39.087 --> 00:37:48.771]  The real truth Assange was leading us to was hidden between the blurred lines of Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, John Podesta's, released emails.
[00:37:48.971 --> 00:37:57.975]  Fast forward past John Podesta's brother, Tony's, casual email exchange with Thalemic spirit cooking adherent Marina Abramovic.
[00:37:58.075 --> 00:38:00.197]  The Rosetta Stone was needed next.
[00:38:00.397 --> 00:38:03.700]  A verification that high-level Washington, D.C.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:12.087]  predatory pedophiles were using a code to communicate child sex trafficking as casually as ordering a pizza.
[00:38:12.247 --> 00:38:21.054]  An FBI unclassified document from WikiLeaks revealed symbols and logos used by pedophiles to identify sexual preferences.
[00:38:21.314 --> 00:38:36.832]  To include those who sexually abuse children, as well as those who produce, distribute, and trade child pornography, are using various types of identification logos, or symbols, to recognize one another and distinguish their sexual preferences.
[00:38:37.012 --> 00:38:43.195]  Investigators should also be attentive to pedophilia symbols advertised on websites.
[00:38:43.495 --> 00:38:56.342]  During examinations of computer files, investigators should be conscious of subjects who try to conceal child pornography by labeling them with symbols instead of typical, suggestive, explicit names.
[00:38:56.702 --> 00:38:59.063]  Thus, the interest in code words.
[00:38:59.403 --> 00:39:00.424]  Now, clues.
[00:39:00.704 --> 00:39:02.625]  The menu from Comet Ping Pong.
[00:39:02.845 --> 00:39:10.931]  Notice the symbol of the ping-pong paddles and its clever resemblance to the FBI document's symbol for child love.
[00:39:11.192 --> 00:39:22.821]  Alright, hang on New York Times, before you declare this fake news from your ivory tower, now look at the symbol for Besta Pizza, just two doors down from Comet Ping-Pong Pizza.
[00:39:23.021 --> 00:39:29.246]  Boldly using the symbol for boy lover as was recorded on the unclassified FBI document.
[00:39:29.446 --> 00:39:38.211]  The evidence begins to reveal that Besta Pizza and Comet Ping Pong Pizza may be competing for the lucrative Washington, D.C.
[00:39:38.291 --> 00:39:40.552]  pedophile market right out in the open.
[00:39:40.692 --> 00:39:50.037]  Comet Ping Pong owner James Alefantis needs to explain himself, and so he did via the Hillary Clinton colluding New York Times.
[00:39:50.217 --> 00:39:53.279]  But so many questions remain unanswered.
[00:39:53.439 --> 00:39:58.822]  Why was this said by the band Heavy Breathing performing in Comet Ping Pong?
[00:39:58.922 --> 00:40:03.308]  He likes the world, sounds, tamales.
[00:40:04.389 --> 00:40:05.431]  And little boys.
[00:40:05.591 --> 00:40:06.292]  And children.
[00:40:06.352 --> 00:40:08.375]  I think that was his manager.
[00:40:08.996 --> 00:40:09.196]  No.
[00:40:09.256 --> 00:40:13.682]  We all have preferences.
[00:40:17.451 --> 00:40:25.859]  Why is the artwork adorning Comet Ping Pong's walls at the very least so insanely creepy, especially for a family restaurant?
[00:40:26.179 --> 00:40:31.324]  Why is Aliphantis so close to Tony Podesta as revealed in the WikiLeaks emails?
[00:40:31.584 --> 00:40:39.371]  And why does Mr. Podesta collect questionable artwork specializing in grotesque eroticism and pedophilic images
[00:40:39.611 --> 00:40:49.519]  Not to mention Podesta's dabbling in what appears to be cannibalistic rituals while continuing his old friendship with convicted pedophile Dennis Hastert.
[00:40:49.719 --> 00:40:53.822]  Why is this man wearing an I Love Children shirt in this situation?
[00:40:54.063 --> 00:40:59.527]  Why did you write hashtag murder next to this incredibly creepy photo you posted?
[00:40:59.787 --> 00:41:03.310]  Why do you find it amusing that this baby is for sale?
[00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:05.832]  Why do you associate with this artist?
[00:41:06.152 --> 00:41:08.174]  Why is any of this okay?
[00:41:08.435 --> 00:41:21.389]  And if these code words are eventually proven to be just another method of communication, then why did the Podesta emails mention the code word pasta for either little boy or sex 78 times?
[00:41:21.709 --> 00:41:24.032]  Code word cheese for little girl 85 times?
[00:41:25.253 --> 00:41:30.038]  And what does Podesta's friend Herb mean by this statement from a Podesta email?
[00:41:30.179 --> 00:41:30.659]  PS.
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:35.385]  Do you think I'll do better playing dominoes on cheese than on pasta?
[00:41:35.725 --> 00:41:39.709]  According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the FBI,
[00:41:41.771 --> 00:41:46.212]  460,699 children went missing in 2015 that we know of.
[00:41:46.372 --> 00:41:56.316]  Mr. Aliphantis, this isn't a witch hunt and it isn't an attack from fake news that your boyfriend David Brock, founder of Media Matters, would have us all ignore.
[00:41:56.596 --> 00:42:10.019]  Either you are the unlucky victim of a fake news onslaught due to your own poorly initiated publicity, or a decades-old pedophile ring operating in the power-hoarding shadows of Washington, D.C.
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.840]  is about to be opened from your front door.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.281]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com.
[00:42:17.853 --> 00:42:23.878]  Trump won, Hillary stole five states, was ordered to stand down by the intelligence agencies, or everything else that's gonna come out on this.
[00:42:23.898 --> 00:42:27.101]  If you're a radio listener, you're lucky you didn't actually see the video.
[00:42:27.201 --> 00:42:34.006]  The art they tweet and Facebook is of children being murdered, cut in pieces, and raped by men with giant genitalia.
[00:42:35.868 --> 00:42:38.910]  So, oh yeah.
[00:42:40.351 --> 00:42:40.712]  Oh yeah.
[00:42:41.552 --> 00:42:42.933]  So, I don't know anymore.
[00:42:44.034 --> 00:42:47.217]  But that's what they're pushing, that's what they got hanging up in there, and it's what they're doing.
[00:42:48.209 --> 00:42:50.490]  And, uh, I can't go out there and investigate it myself.
[00:42:50.531 --> 00:42:51.711]  We've had reporters on that have been there.
[00:42:51.771 --> 00:42:57.635]  They say it's really creepy because, um... I don't have the self-control to be around these type of people.
[00:42:58.315 --> 00:43:00.497]  So... You want us to cover Pizzagate?
[00:43:00.517 --> 00:43:01.157]  We have covered it.
[00:43:01.197 --> 00:43:02.117]  We are covering it.
[00:43:02.137 --> 00:43:03.318]  And all I know is, God help us.
[00:43:03.358 --> 00:43:04.419]  We're in the hands of pure evil.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.561]  We'll be right back on AlexJonesAndFoolWars.com.
[00:43:09.448 --> 00:43:19.512]  Well, Black Friday Week has basically come and gone, but we're going to have the specials for one more day, where there was a huge special each day, like 50% off on Colloidal Silver at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:43:19.612 --> 00:43:25.934]  Now, all the specials that were one day only are back on this one day only, but all the specials together.
[00:43:25.954 --> 00:43:34.877]  So if you missed out on any of the specials, missed out on a chance to help fund the InfoWars, the final day of Black Friday Week at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com are
[00:43:35.157 --> 00:43:42.261]  And again, thank you for funding the True Tip of the Spear and the fight for human liberty.
[00:43:42.481 --> 00:43:50.925]  We could not have done it without you, and I want to salute you for your support, your prayers, the action you've taken, every race, color, and creed.
[00:43:50.965 --> 00:43:53.786]  We are all red-blooded humans together, and I love you.
[00:43:54.407 --> 00:43:56.328]  And from myself and my family to yours,
[00:43:57.308 --> 00:44:06.777]  I pledge on the eternal altar of God, absolute resistance over every form of tyranny, over the mind of men, to paraphrase Thomas Jefferson.
[00:44:06.977 --> 00:44:08.639]  You've got my commitment.
[00:44:09.259 --> 00:44:11.341]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:44:11.381 --> 00:44:12.883]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[00:44:13.143 --> 00:44:16.664]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[00:44:17.025 --> 00:44:24.768]  InfoWars LifeSeeker 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[00:44:24.968 --> 00:44:29.770]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:35.412]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[00:44:35.752 --> 00:44:43.298]  Secret 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[00:44:43.518 --> 00:44:47.982]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:44:48.242 --> 00:44:53.987]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes.
[00:44:54.107 --> 00:44:57.068]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[00:44:57.269 --> 00:45:00.570]  Electrify your mind and body, and take your health to the next level.
[00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:04.492]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:45:08.474 --> 00:45:12.876]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:45:12.936 --> 00:45:23.882]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:45:24.042 --> 00:45:28.965]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:45:29.085 --> 00:45:31.587]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:45:31.647 --> 00:45:33.148]  It helps detoxify.
[00:45:33.368 --> 00:45:36.190]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:41.013]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:45:41.033 --> 00:45:47.278]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[00:45:47.318 --> 00:45:52.581]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:45:54.322 --> 00:45:55.063]  This is so key.
[00:45:55.323 --> 00:45:57.624]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[00:45:57.865 --> 00:45:59.606]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:45:59.626 --> 00:46:01.727]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:46:01.847 --> 00:46:07.571]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:46:08.652 --> 00:46:12.474]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[00:46:12.814 --> 00:46:20.059]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable grape-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:46:20.259 --> 00:46:31.423]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:46:31.724 --> 00:46:39.286]  In the history of Infowarslife, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:46:39.527 --> 00:46:43.128]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today.
[00:46:43.428 --> 00:46:53.394]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:46:53.614 --> 00:47:00.378]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:47:00.699 --> 00:47:01.859]  That means it's clean.
[00:47:02.159 --> 00:47:03.260]  That means it's pure.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.062]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:47:06.242 --> 00:47:07.903]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:47:13.519 --> 00:47:15.981]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:16.001 --> 00:47:17.742]  Alright, now I'm officially blown away, folks.
[00:47:17.822 --> 00:47:18.403]  Get ready for this.
[00:47:29.031 --> 00:47:33.094]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:33.535 --> 00:47:37.318]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:38.058 --> 00:47:40.140]  Alright, Julian Assange has disappeared.
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.921]  Other than one interview, it doesn't sound like him.
[00:47:41.961 --> 00:47:51.329]  Over the telephone, they admit the embassy is basically holding him, now criminally, in a locked up room and having prosecutors from Europe come and visit him.
[00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.830]  We've got that.
[00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:53.431]  We've got
[00:47:54.211 --> 00:47:55.972]  Phil Castro dying, I haven't even gotten to that.
[00:47:55.992 --> 00:47:56.813]  There's so much happening.
[00:47:56.833 --> 00:47:57.693]  But you want to know about crazy?
[00:47:58.373 --> 00:48:04.216]  Matt, one of the great producers, was showing me the official Andrew Breitbart Twitter from 2011.
[00:48:04.256 --> 00:48:04.797]  I went and looked.
[00:48:04.837 --> 00:48:09.919]  Yeah, it's Andrew Breitbart, the pioneer journalist who Drudge helped launch.
[00:48:10.059 --> 00:48:10.620]  It's him.
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:14.742]  And it's a comment about Podesta being a world-class child trafficker.
[00:48:15.722 --> 00:48:19.404]  Now, I was shown this about an hour ago, 10 minutes before showtime.
[00:48:19.945 --> 00:48:20.865]  I hadn't got to it yet.
[00:48:21.005 --> 00:48:22.046]  Joe Biggs, look at this.
[00:48:23.163 --> 00:48:39.466]  just texted me how prong guru John Podesta isn't household name as world-class underage sex slave op cover defending unspeakable dregs escapes me.
[00:48:42.227 --> 00:48:46.167]  And of course Breitbart was dead and a year later he said he had stuff coming out that would destroy forever.
[00:48:48.488 --> 00:48:48.788]  Obama.
[00:48:50.452 --> 00:48:53.153]  And the word we had was it was all the gay stuff out of Chicago.
[00:48:56.215 --> 00:48:58.536]  Hey, I'm all about people having free will with adults.
[00:48:58.596 --> 00:49:00.057]  My thing is you don't mess with kids.
[00:49:00.077 --> 00:49:01.698]  Heterosexual, homosexual, I don't care.
[00:49:02.058 --> 00:49:02.978]  Keep your hands off.
[00:49:03.038 --> 00:49:06.400]  But we're going to retweet Andrew Breitbart's comment.
[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:08.181]  Triple check that's his verified account.
[00:49:08.221 --> 00:49:08.761]  It says it is.
[00:49:08.801 --> 00:49:09.642]  That is so wild.
[00:49:10.322 --> 00:49:12.023]  Yeah, I mean the pedestrians are so arrogant.
[00:49:12.063 --> 00:49:13.343]  Part of this is doing it publicly.
[00:49:14.204 --> 00:49:17.626]  One of his brothers that's heavily involved in D.C.
[00:49:19.534 --> 00:49:24.556]  Put out an article about how they take naked photos of the neighborhood kids and have them hanging up around their house.
[00:49:25.736 --> 00:49:26.977]  And that was like seven, eight years ago.
[00:49:27.017 --> 00:49:28.877]  We covered that and the Washington Post pulled it.
[00:49:28.897 --> 00:49:30.458]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[00:49:30.498 --> 00:49:34.780]  This is so... This is so crazy.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:38.621]  The point is, whoever that was, Andrew Breitbart or whoever, that was five years ago.
[00:49:38.641 --> 00:49:43.463]  I want to segue into some other news now, obviously, but...
[00:49:44.943 --> 00:49:47.624]  These are times that try folks' souls.
[00:49:47.644 --> 00:49:53.646]  I want to get into some fake news, and how the mainstream media is the main purveyor of that at the moment, and get into some of the other news.
[00:49:54.026 --> 00:49:55.227]  I have Roger Stone joining us.
[00:49:56.567 --> 00:50:03.830]  Briefly, we're running Black Friday specials right through the weekend, and these are already great products at very low prices that everybody should want and use.
[00:50:05.572 --> 00:50:10.739]  Even if they weren't great products, which they are, it's funding, the tip of the spear, that tells the truth like no other organization.
[00:50:10.759 --> 00:50:13.343]  I love for people to say, hey Alex, you shouldn't have sponsors.
[00:50:13.363 --> 00:50:15.105]  That's mainstream media and trolls.
[00:50:15.506 --> 00:50:16.447]  You shouldn't fund yourself.
[00:50:16.988 --> 00:50:22.195]  We have the funding of a small town newspaper and we are bigger than the BBC and the New York Times online.
[00:50:23.243 --> 00:50:24.024]  Go to Quantcast.com.
[00:50:24.064 --> 00:50:24.804]  I'm not bragging.
[00:50:25.125 --> 00:50:25.625]  It's a fact.
[00:50:26.066 --> 00:50:28.427]  You're getting colloidal silver, Silver Bullet, for $9.95.
[00:50:29.528 --> 00:50:33.572]  We get it from the national manufacturer that supplies Whole Foods that sells it for more than $20.
[00:50:34.553 --> 00:50:35.273]  But it's a sale!
[00:50:35.333 --> 00:50:36.394]  They sell it for $19.95.

[00:50:44.081 --> 00:50:44.541]  It's silver.
[00:50:45.402 --> 00:50:46.262]  That's when it's oxidized.
[00:50:46.322 --> 00:50:48.164]  It turns that weird yellow meaning it wasn't done properly.
[00:50:48.464 --> 00:50:50.086]  This is pure, clear water.
[00:50:50.999 --> 00:50:51.399]  I don't know.
[00:51:10.575 --> 00:51:14.276]  We have free shipping that ends today with promo code FREE at checkout.

[00:51:49.421 --> 00:51:50.984]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:51:51.324 --> 00:51:53.207]  Infowarsstore.com again is the umbrella site.
[00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:59.272]  Take advantage of all of this Black Friday Week free speech special.
[00:52:00.032 --> 00:52:03.073]  30% off survival shield nascent iodine X2, the good halogen.
[00:52:03.373 --> 00:52:05.154]  Go research about the iodine conspiracy.
[00:52:05.414 --> 00:52:19.739]  The federal government's own documents that they've added iodine in the Midwest, well nationwide, but it started in the Midwest from the 20s to the 70s because IQs were so low, goiter was so bad, thyroid problems were so huge, and IQs boosted up to 15% on average.
[00:52:20.099 --> 00:52:22.600]  Just Google thyroid added to salt, 15%.
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:24.800]  IQ increase.
[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:27.601]  But most of the iodine on store shelves will kill you if you drink it.
[00:52:27.621 --> 00:52:28.301]  It's for topical.
[00:52:28.561 --> 00:52:35.483]  This is real iodine, not bound, not garbage, not chemical iodine, not from rotting seaweed, not from... This is from deep-earth crystals.
[00:52:35.523 --> 00:52:36.543]  Nobody else has got this.
[00:52:38.003 --> 00:52:45.645]  We were searching for a true iodine to put out, and we got persecuted by enemies that found it in our supplier and shut it down, and then just... God dropped it in our lap.
[00:52:46.145 --> 00:52:48.466]  A deep-earth source that we've had now for four years.
[00:52:48.926 --> 00:52:49.666]  What a blessing.
[00:52:49.726 --> 00:52:51.387]  No weapon formed against us will prosper.
[00:52:51.427 --> 00:52:53.027]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:58.862]  Try Supermel Vitality, try Anthroplex, try X2.

[00:53:12.228 --> 00:53:16.890]  Okay, I have delved into Pizzagate.
[00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:24.393]  Thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands, I mean there's thousands of emails.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:30.562]  More than 30,000 just dealing with all this talk about, I can't wait for the succulent hot dogs.
[00:53:30.902 --> 00:53:32.503]  Obama wants 60,000 plus.
[00:53:32.583 --> 00:53:33.623]  Oh my God, they're the best.
[00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:35.984]  Oh, we're going to have them in the D.C.
[00:53:36.044 --> 00:53:37.345]  and in Hawaii, the hot dogs.
[00:53:38.545 --> 00:53:40.226]  Okay, Obama likes men and hot dogs.
[00:53:40.286 --> 00:53:43.007]  I mean, I'll say for positive thing, it looks like he's after adult men.
[00:53:43.047 --> 00:53:43.928]  That's legal and lawful.
[00:53:44.788 --> 00:53:47.929]  I mean, you know, and then Hillary wants this and all this crap.
[00:53:47.989 --> 00:53:49.550]  I mean, you cannot make this stuff up.
[00:53:50.751 --> 00:53:52.531]  You look at Weiner who's involved in all this.
[00:53:52.571 --> 00:53:53.912]  I mean, what do you expect from these people?
[00:53:54.935 --> 00:53:55.975]  And it's like, what?
[00:53:57.376 --> 00:53:59.176]  We will have the children in the hot tub.
[00:53:59.276 --> 00:54:00.517]  One is six, one is seven, one is eight.
[00:54:01.197 --> 00:54:04.018]  Some can be persnickety, but they do enjoy themselves, you know.
[00:54:04.538 --> 00:54:05.758]  Go read it for yourself.
[00:54:07.139 --> 00:54:15.862]  And then you see them having rock bands play, talking about stuff with kids, and then kids being... I can't even say it on air, folks.
[00:54:16.962 --> 00:54:22.384]  The video, we're going to tweet it out with Breitbart's statement on Infowars.com.
[00:54:23.598 --> 00:54:24.399]  Dealing with Pizzagate.
[00:54:24.419 --> 00:54:26.961]  We're going to tweet it out right now.
[00:54:26.981 --> 00:54:28.142]  Real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[00:54:28.182 --> 00:54:29.504]  And you just send it out.
[00:54:29.764 --> 00:54:30.204]  Send it out.
[00:54:30.264 --> 00:54:31.546]  Because here's the deal.
[00:54:31.566 --> 00:54:35.890]  There's massive censorship on Reddit, on Twitter, on Facebook, everywhere.
[00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:38.673]  And I'm not going to come out and say what all this is.
[00:54:41.581 --> 00:54:58.571]  They may just have, you know, symbols that look closely like symbols the FBI says is what traffickers have, and they may just have images of naked kids on the walls, and may just be tweeting this stuff out and talking about torture and death of children, and then may just have rock bands there talking about, you know, uh, you know, your preferences as children because it's just an accident.
[00:54:59.011 --> 00:54:59.691]  Probably is!
[00:54:59.731 --> 00:55:01.292]  I'm sure that's all that's going on here.
[00:55:03.033 --> 00:55:05.895]  See, I start down this line, I can't stop, see?
[00:55:08.156 --> 00:55:10.878]  Let's Ben Grimm say it's clobbering time.
[00:55:12.355 --> 00:55:14.056]  My instinct is to say I'm not a killer.
[00:55:14.076 --> 00:55:19.880]  But when people mess with kids, it flips switches.
[00:55:23.523 --> 00:55:25.704]  Really scary switches.
[00:55:27.986 --> 00:55:38.113]  And I've been doing this too long, I've seen too much, and I'm done for now talking about this because I can't stand it once I start looking into it.
[00:55:39.793 --> 00:55:40.714]  You go look into it.
[00:55:40.774 --> 00:55:41.514]  You're the human.
[00:55:41.554 --> 00:55:42.335]  You're the individuals.
[00:55:42.355 --> 00:55:42.955]  You're the listeners.
[00:55:42.995 --> 00:55:43.376]  Just go.
[00:55:43.816 --> 00:55:44.756]  Go out and do it.
[00:55:45.777 --> 00:55:50.280]  My crew will cover it, but I just, you know... It gets to me.
[00:55:51.541 --> 00:55:52.402]  I already know all this stuff.
[00:55:52.422 --> 00:55:54.203]  I've been telling you for years there are a bunch of devil worshippers.
[00:55:54.223 --> 00:55:59.867]  Some people can bitch at me when I'm the progenitor of exposing what they're into.
[00:56:00.928 --> 00:56:08.113]  How can some general who's won hundreds of wars for everybody be bad because I'm not just constantly obsessing on something that I quite frankly can't mentally deal with?
[00:56:09.758 --> 00:56:11.320]  Now let's get into the other news here, coming up.
[00:56:12.681 --> 00:56:16.444]  Fake News Onslaught Targets Pizzeria As Nest Of Child Traffickers, New York Times.
[00:56:16.605 --> 00:56:16.765]  Oh.
[00:56:18.226 --> 00:56:21.650]  Fearing Yet Another Witch Hunt, Reddit Bans Pizzagate, Washington Post.
[00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:24.732]  Pizzagate Shows How Fake News Hurts Real People.
[00:56:24.773 --> 00:56:28.196]  Yeah, I'm sure you may insert in the email somebody who's innocent wasn't involved.
[00:56:28.236 --> 00:56:29.077]  That's not our issue.
[00:56:30.098 --> 00:56:33.241]  The point is this got hacked by intelligence agencies to warn the world.
[00:56:34.701 --> 00:56:39.343]  The NYPD has told me directly and through sources that it's horrible child trafficking.
[00:56:39.363 --> 00:56:41.243]  I don't know about Pizzagate and some other town.
[00:56:41.583 --> 00:56:43.584]  All I know is there's some stuff going on.
[00:56:43.624 --> 00:56:45.085]  Will they red herring some innocent group?
[00:56:45.105 --> 00:56:45.365]  Maybe.
[00:56:45.565 --> 00:56:46.505]  That's why we gotta be careful.
[00:56:48.946 --> 00:56:51.407]  A fake conspiracy for our fevered age.
[00:56:51.467 --> 00:56:52.067]  Bloomberg.
[00:56:52.868 --> 00:56:54.348]  The same guy that says he doesn't want our guns.
[00:56:55.268 --> 00:56:56.929]  Is there any real evidence for Pizzagate?
[00:56:57.009 --> 00:57:01.391]  Reddit CEO fans conspiracy theory flames by banning discussion of it.
[00:57:01.431 --> 00:57:02.291]  Yeah, shouldn't do that.
[00:57:03.615 --> 00:57:09.717]  I don't know, thousands of emails talking about code words and stuff that the FBI issues and says are code words for pedophilia.
[00:57:10.037 --> 00:57:11.177]  But let's get into this right now.
[00:57:12.137 --> 00:57:14.498]  Here's what's really important.
[00:57:14.678 --> 00:57:18.799]  EU censoring free speech with fake news claims, says IFJ.
[00:57:19.379 --> 00:57:23.961]  We have some nebulous, unnamed group that has come out.
[00:57:24.321 --> 00:57:26.281]  The Washington Post has now put out a new fake list.
[00:57:26.782 --> 00:57:31.643]  And you go to the website, it won't even say who it is, listing DrudgeReport.com, Infowars.com as fake.
[00:57:32.878 --> 00:57:41.141]  And the International Federation of Journalists, very respected, has come out and said this is a way to stifle journalism, this is a fraud, and a lot of the sites listed, they're saying have done a lot of great work.
[00:57:41.261 --> 00:57:41.781]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:42.061 --> 00:57:43.702]  You let bad sites, good sites be there.
[00:57:43.722 --> 00:57:46.103]  We all know the Washington Post is fake news, CNN's fake news.
[00:57:46.723 --> 00:57:54.026]  That's why I love how the fake news is saying we're fake news, and they're specifically crapping themselves over Pizzagate, and their answer is to say it's all fake.
[00:57:54.826 --> 00:57:56.187]  No, WikiLeaks released this.
[00:57:56.227 --> 00:57:56.827]  This is in there.
[00:57:59.816 --> 00:58:09.901]  Well, Black Friday week has basically come and gone, but we're going to have the specials for one more day, where there was a huge special each day, like 50% off on colloidal silver at Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:09.961 --> 00:58:16.243]  Now, all the specials that were one day only are back on this one day only, but all the specials together.
[00:58:16.283 --> 00:58:25.187]  So if you missed out on any of the specials, missed out on a chance to help fund the Infowar, the final day of Black Friday week at Infowarsstore.com or Infowarslife.com,
[00:58:26.388 --> 00:58:32.632]  And again, thank you for funding the True Tip of the Spear and the fight for human liberty.
[00:58:32.832 --> 00:58:39.276]  We could not have done it without you, and I want to salute you for your support, your prayers, the action you've taken.
[00:58:39.916 --> 00:58:44.119]  Every race, color, and creed, we are all red-blooded humans together, and I love you.
[00:58:44.139 --> 00:58:46.701]  And from myself and my family to yours,
[00:58:47.661 --> 00:58:57.126]  I pledge on the eternal altar of God, absolute resistance over every form of tyranny, over the mind of men, to paraphrase Thomas Jefferson.
[00:58:57.346 --> 00:58:59.007]  You've got my commitment!
[00:58:59.287 --> 00:59:08.312]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:59:08.372 --> 00:59:16.476]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:59:16.776 --> 00:59:21.478]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:59:21.638 --> 00:59:28.381]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:28.441 --> 00:59:35.525]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:59:35.625 --> 00:59:42.468]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:59:42.648 --> 00:59:46.990]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:59:47.110 --> 00:59:50.371]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:59:50.511 --> 00:59:56.634]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:59:56.814 --> 00:59:59.035]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:00:03.456 --> 01:00:06.078]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:13.211 --> 01:00:18.075]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.139 --> 01:00:26.561]  Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign.
[01:00:26.581 --> 01:00:35.308]  And the guy that plays down his Axis influence will be joining us.
[01:00:37.049 --> 01:00:39.912]  I've only covered a third of the news I wanted to hit so far.
[01:00:40.936 --> 01:00:49.382]  If you go to our Twitter, at RealAlexJones, you can see that we're tweeting about what's really going on with PedophileGate or PervertGate.
[01:00:50.283 --> 01:00:56.727]  But, you know, it sounds totally alien to the normal person, but if you study history, elites are always seeking after the innocents.
[01:00:56.807 --> 01:01:01.811]  Most cultures end up getting a weird priesthood running it that are obsessed with the sacrifice of human children.
[01:01:04.198 --> 01:01:07.721]  So, as I said, I'm going to retweet out Andrew Breitbart's tweet from five years ago.
[01:01:07.741 --> 01:01:08.281]  Have we done that yet?
[01:01:08.301 --> 01:01:09.182]  Let's scroll down.
[01:01:09.202 --> 01:01:10.963]  I usually tweet myself when I'm on air.
[01:01:11.003 --> 01:01:11.724]  I obviously can't do it.
[01:01:12.605 --> 01:01:26.335]  Where, yeah, where reportedly Andrew Breitbart, I mean it was a real account, looks like it's his, from five years ago, talked about the Podestas and their activities.
[01:01:26.355 --> 01:01:31.339]  Then you find him in the Washington Post talking about how much they love hanging up pictures of the naked neighborhood kids in their house.
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.341]  They called it a, what, radical art?
[01:01:35.063 --> 01:01:35.843]  Revolutionary art?
[01:01:37.164 --> 01:01:38.645]  But I'm done talking about that now.
[01:01:39.545 --> 01:01:44.047]  I'm going to shift gears into what we can totally prove, what we can document, and they're coming after our free speech.
[01:01:44.607 --> 01:01:48.769]  When we talk about the EU being unelected, they call that fake news, they're wanting to ban it.
[01:01:49.389 --> 01:01:52.711]  The International Federation of Journalists is coming out saying it's a threat to free speech.
[01:01:54.371 --> 01:01:56.172]  Using fake news against opposing views.
[01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:59.834]  I love how the Washington Post and others have come out and
[01:02:01.806 --> 01:02:05.188]  Promoted a new fake list, and they don't even say who came up with the list.
[01:02:05.549 --> 01:02:08.451]  They just list some website that doesn't say who it is.
[01:02:10.292 --> 01:02:14.455]  Absolutely no attribution, no proof, no bibliography.
[01:02:14.475 --> 01:02:20.639]  It'd be one thing if they put out a big list of fake news and then showed a bunch of examples per news agency who was fake.
[01:02:20.679 --> 01:02:31.267]  I called Paul Watson today and I said, I'll do it if you don't have time, but I want to take the list we mentioned a few weeks ago that Ron Paul kind of picked up on and put back out and he said, you know, fake news is mainstream media that launched all these wars, that lies to us, that
[01:02:31.857 --> 01:02:35.539]  You know, puts out fake debate questions beforehand and gets caught rigging everything.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.681]  That's who's fake news, not us that are exposing it.
[01:02:38.721 --> 01:02:43.703]  But we should just put out that whole list and then just point out, you know, definitive list.
[01:02:43.763 --> 01:02:45.564]  And hey, by the way, InfoWars is saying this.
[01:02:45.825 --> 01:02:46.485]  Here's our name.
[01:02:46.525 --> 01:02:47.185]  Here's who we are.
[01:02:48.586 --> 01:02:53.529]  But you want to wonder how they're going to strike back as they lose control and lose their grasp over the people?
[01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:53.989]  This is it.
[01:02:57.506 --> 01:03:01.047]  Tensions are reportedly rising at CNN as the network aims for Trump.
[01:03:01.107 --> 01:03:05.749]  Since the election, CNN has out MSNBCed MSNBC.
[01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:06.489]  Oh yeah, it is.
[01:03:07.289 --> 01:03:07.569]  It is.
[01:03:07.629 --> 01:03:08.830]  He stole the election.
[01:03:08.890 --> 01:03:09.950]  He's not the president.
[01:03:10.310 --> 01:03:11.711]  The recount's reasonable.
[01:03:12.691 --> 01:03:14.052]  Hillary's involved now.
[01:03:14.232 --> 01:03:16.832]  It goes on and on and on.
[01:03:16.912 --> 01:03:17.513]  What a joke.
[01:03:20.239 --> 01:03:20.739]  News Network.
[01:03:20.759 --> 01:03:25.980]  Speaking of them, the fake news CNN accidentally falsely admitted it aired pornography for 30 minutes on Thanksgiving.
[01:03:26.381 --> 01:03:30.402]  Turned out it was their Boston affiliate aired 30 minutes of tranny porn.
[01:03:31.022 --> 01:03:32.922]  And it was CNN feed that was supposed to be there.
[01:03:32.962 --> 01:03:34.843]  So they just can't get anything right.
[01:03:34.863 --> 01:03:35.463]  But that's okay.
[01:03:35.483 --> 01:03:36.643]  Because they're CNN.
[01:03:36.683 --> 01:03:40.824]  Imagine if they aired 30 minutes of spirit cooking.
[01:03:40.844 --> 01:03:44.505]  A bunch of supermodels and people drinking blood.
[01:03:45.466 --> 01:03:47.046]  Coming up, Washington Post
[01:03:49.651 --> 01:04:00.257]  Minion Donald Donald Trump's enemy Barack Obama has come out and again further basically worship Fidel Castro.
[01:04:00.277 --> 01:04:01.878]  We're gonna get to all of that coming up.
[01:04:02.439 --> 01:04:05.741]  Meanwhile Obama urged Clinton to concede on election night.
[01:04:07.162 --> 01:04:11.405]  Journalist tricked into spreading hoax Trump-inspired attack.
[01:04:11.925 --> 01:04:15.368]  There's a video on that we're gonna be getting to and so much more.
[01:04:15.528 --> 01:04:15.888]  Oh, yeah.
[01:04:16.428 --> 01:04:20.931]  Folks, they have turned the fake news game up to a whole new level.
[01:04:22.853 --> 01:04:25.915]  I'm seeing quotes and things that I never even said.
[01:04:26.175 --> 01:04:28.096]  It's not even edited quotes.
[01:04:28.156 --> 01:04:30.678]  It's not even quotes where they cut stuff off out of context.
[01:04:30.718 --> 01:04:36.762]  They're now just putting out entirely fake quotes on us to the point of I can't even keep track of it anymore.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:05:01.512]  So it really is up to everybody out there just to stay focused and to remember what you saw and what you read and to not believe anything MSM says because, you know, I bust my butt to actually give you what they said, what they did, what they claimed, who they stood for, but it is so hard with mainstream media because as they collapse, as they die, as they fail to deliver the win to Hillary and George Soros and the globalists, they're not giving up.
[01:05:01.612 --> 01:05:05.994]  They are just doing what they always did but three or four times worse, hoping that
[01:05:07.052 --> 01:05:07.514]  They'll win.
[01:05:07.555 --> 01:05:09.084]  That's the definition of insanity in my book.
[01:05:10.185 --> 01:05:16.910]  Well, it looks like President-elect Donald Trump is making good on his promises day one of the Trump presidency to withdraw from the TPP.
[01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:20.933]  We have an article that's up on our website, Infowars.com, and aggregated from CNS News.
[01:05:21.053 --> 01:05:27.198]  It talks about how Trump characterized the move, a part of a plan to advance the simple core principle of, quote, putting America first.
[01:05:27.258 --> 01:05:30.581]  Of course, that's been his credo down with globalism the entire campaign.
[01:05:30.621 --> 01:05:38.707]  And now that President-elect Donald Trump, who said on Monday that his first day in office next January will be to begin the process of withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
[01:05:39.107 --> 01:05:39.627]  We're good to go.
[01:06:09.187 --> 01:06:11.509]  We're good to go.
[01:06:41.744 --> 01:06:53.869]  I've talked to Roger Stone off record about the weird devil worship in the Podesta emails.
[01:06:53.929 --> 01:06:57.770]  The weird talk about Obama wants $60,000 plus in hot dogs.
[01:06:57.790 --> 01:06:58.691]  Oh, they're so luscious.
[01:06:58.751 --> 01:06:59.771]  I can't wait to get one.
[01:07:00.631 --> 01:07:03.072]  We'll have three kids in the hot tub for you at the farmhouse.
[01:07:03.112 --> 01:07:04.593]  They're going to be responsive.
[01:07:05.493 --> 01:07:07.994]  I mean, this is scary stuff, folks.
[01:07:08.635 --> 01:07:11.396]  I'm not saying everybody involved in the emails are pedophiles.
[01:07:11.456 --> 01:07:13.577]  Clearly that goes on in England, it goes on here.
[01:07:14.018 --> 01:07:15.939]  It's come out that a lot of political elites are involved in that.
[01:07:15.979 --> 01:07:21.362]  I brought it up to him and he talked about some heavy hitters that said, no, there's definitely something going on here.
[01:07:22.442 --> 01:07:24.924]  I've talked to people involved in the NYPD over a month ago.
[01:07:24.984 --> 01:07:27.345]  They said, look, that's what's being held over the head.
[01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:32.673]  That if Hillary tries to go forward, it's going to be brought out.
[01:07:33.734 --> 01:07:35.335]  Assange hasn't done a real interview.
[01:07:35.395 --> 01:07:40.299]  He did supposedly some phone interview, but it doesn't even sound like him in 40-something days.
[01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:42.421]  So a lot is going on.
[01:07:42.441 --> 01:07:44.343]  I want to get into Romney.
[01:07:44.903 --> 01:07:54.531]  I remember talking to a little bird, separate from Stone, but calling Stone over a week ago and saying, I hear that Conway's doing the right thing and is against this Romney deal.
[01:07:55.273 --> 01:08:00.577]  And I talked to others, but now she's in the news today, openly coming out, saying, did Romney even vote for Trump?
[01:08:01.378 --> 01:08:03.019]  So, wow, it's good to see her standing up.
[01:08:03.039 --> 01:08:04.120]  We know Bannon's against it.
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:10.905]  But really, it's a major lie in the sand for a lot of people, and it's a test of, will Trump stand up for the base and what he stood for?
[01:08:11.345 --> 01:08:13.286]  I'm giving him benefit of the doubt until he gets in.
[01:08:13.667 --> 01:08:14.647]  That's what really matters to me.
[01:08:14.708 --> 01:08:18.390]  I know major enemies of this country are his enemies, so I'm giving him benefit of the doubt.
[01:08:19.231 --> 01:08:23.014]  But, because he may just put these folks in because they know how to run things and later kick them out.
[01:08:23.254 --> 01:08:24.034]  Trump's a smart guy.
[01:08:24.929 --> 01:08:25.429]  We've got that.
[01:08:25.730 --> 01:08:27.631]  We've got the recount that I knew was serious.
[01:08:28.351 --> 01:08:29.452]  And now Hillary's joined it.
[01:08:29.933 --> 01:08:31.754]  So Trump's been forced to actually respond to it.
[01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:33.635]  It was a big joke three or four days ago.
[01:08:33.675 --> 01:08:34.156]  It's not now.
[01:08:34.756 --> 01:08:37.598]  So, Roger Stone, in this whole pantheon, where do you want to begin?
[01:08:38.899 --> 01:08:43.723]  Well, Mitt Romney's probably an excellent place to start, Alex.
[01:08:44.223 --> 01:08:51.028]  Like you, I commend Kellyanne Conway for saying what everybody at the grassroots of the Trump movement is saying.
[01:08:52.172 --> 01:08:53.794]  I mean, there's several dimensions to this.
[01:08:53.894 --> 01:08:57.097]  Mitt Romney didn't just not support Donald Trump.
[01:08:57.137 --> 01:09:03.062]  He called him, and I quote, a con man, close quote, a quote, phony quote, and a fraud.
[01:09:04.983 --> 01:09:07.065]  That's not like saying he's not qualified.
[01:09:07.185 --> 01:09:13.671]  But more importantly, his appointment would send a signal to world leaders and everybody in the United States
[01:09:14.577 --> 01:09:18.599]  That you can essentially dump on Trump and nothing happens to you.
[01:09:18.899 --> 01:09:19.199]  That's right.
[01:09:19.219 --> 01:09:20.459]  He's running up a white flag.
[01:09:20.479 --> 01:09:21.720]  He's saying, bend me over a barrel.
[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:23.281]  And let me just add something to interrupt here.
[01:09:23.761 --> 01:09:26.182]  This is the guy that helped ride Obamacare, Mitt Romney.
[01:09:26.202 --> 01:09:28.323]  This is the guy that ran all these pump and dumps.
[01:09:28.363 --> 01:09:32.624]  The guy that ran all these, you know, corporate takeovers of legitimate businesses.
[01:09:32.644 --> 01:09:35.986]  This is the guy that, you know, movies like Wall Street are made about.
[01:09:36.406 --> 01:09:38.387]  He's everything wrong with the Republican Party.
[01:09:38.427 --> 01:09:41.368]  He's a slime bag, so Trump better stand up against him.
[01:09:41.388 --> 01:09:41.948]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:09:42.168 --> 01:09:43.349]  He's the con man, is what I'm saying.
[01:09:44.089 --> 01:09:50.155]  Not only that, but he is more bellicose on Russia than Trump.
[01:09:50.195 --> 01:09:52.537]  He kind of takes the neocon hard line.
[01:09:54.278 --> 01:09:58.462]  He basically borrowed his ideology, such as it is, from the Bushes.
[01:09:59.602 --> 01:10:03.326]  He was not even a registered Republican two years before he ran for governor.
[01:10:03.346 --> 01:10:04.226]  He ran for the U.S.
[01:10:04.246 --> 01:10:08.330]  Senate to Ted Kennedy's left, if there is any space over there.
[01:10:10.082 --> 01:10:13.165]  But more importantly, he doesn't share the President's vision.
[01:10:13.205 --> 01:10:23.414]  I would say this, that if you look at it historically, the greatest Secretary of State and the ones who had the most credibility in the world were the ones that had a personal relationship with the President.
[01:10:24.095 --> 01:10:27.738]  Baker and Bush, Nixon and Kissinger, and so on.
[01:10:28.479 --> 01:10:32.563]  So I think that that speaks to Rudy Giuliani.
[01:10:33.502 --> 01:10:36.423]  Rudy and I are not a perfect ideological fit.
[01:10:36.503 --> 01:10:38.903]  I disagree with him on many things, but I will say this.
[01:10:39.623 --> 01:10:44.484]  When the fight came, he gave the only fight speech at the convention other than General Flynn.
[01:10:44.524 --> 01:10:45.285]  And let's go further.
[01:10:45.345 --> 01:10:47.525]  I don't know if you can say this, because I've got issues with Giuliani.
[01:10:47.565 --> 01:10:48.305]  He's not perfect.
[01:10:48.705 --> 01:10:58.747]  But since the campaign got down to the rubber meeting the road, Giuliani with the NYPD and stuff, they really came through exposing the Clintons at the key clinch moment.
[01:10:59.068 --> 01:11:01.008]  I mean, Giuliani really helped deliver the White House.
[01:11:01.914 --> 01:11:03.095]  Well, I think that's true.
[01:11:03.155 --> 01:11:18.529]  I also think that in terms of getting the NYPD to publicly lay this record out at an appropriate time, if there is an attempt by the Justice Department to bury it, to cover it up, Giuliani may yet have a role to play.
[01:11:18.969 --> 01:11:21.051]  So you can confirm what my sources are saying?
[01:11:21.091 --> 01:11:23.233]  The torpedoes are on them with the emails.
[01:11:23.593 --> 01:11:26.256]  If the Clintons or anybody else tries anything, torpedoes will launch.
[01:11:27.697 --> 01:11:55.875]  Well, here's what I do know, that on the Monday before the election, when Director Comey of the FBI said, nothing to do with votes, keep voting, there was enormous pressure put on NYPD that members of the department would be indicted in the Eric Garner case, if NYPD did not stand down for some period of time, through the election.
[01:11:56.593 --> 01:12:12.365]  But the fact that the president has indicated that he doesn't want to prosecute the Clintons, that's fine, but it's almost outdated because I think there will be substantially more proof of wrongdoing.
[01:12:13.052 --> 01:12:17.234]  And at some point, the American people are going to demand, you know, justice.
[01:12:17.254 --> 01:12:19.535]  Sure, Roger Stowe, I want to get to that.
[01:12:19.555 --> 01:12:23.017]  I don't want to give inside baseball out that I've gotten from my other sources to talk to you about.
[01:12:23.657 --> 01:12:29.560]  Clearly, it's not the President's job to go out for someone, and the Democrats already know he is planning to do justice.
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:32.421]  His constituents demand it, justice demands it.
[01:12:32.761 --> 01:12:40.865]  It was in the New York Post today, I knew this four days ago but didn't go with it, that he's basically going to have foreign leaders, just like
[01:12:41.949 --> 01:12:44.170]  Obama had Switzerland expose Swiss bank accounts.
[01:12:44.591 --> 01:12:49.694]  Trump is going to tell foreign leaders do the right thing and release the Clinton Foundation info.
[01:12:49.734 --> 01:12:50.654]  That's the New York Post.
[01:12:50.994 --> 01:12:52.175]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:12:52.215 --> 01:12:53.136]  Kit Daniels wrote about it.
[01:12:53.476 --> 01:13:01.681]  I don't sit on news, but at a certain point, this level of stratagem, I don't want to sit there and give them what's coming down the pike.
[01:13:01.761 --> 01:13:05.283]  But I think they're smart enough to know Trump's playing possum till he gets in.
[01:13:06.243 --> 01:13:08.889]  Well, maybe this is Alex Parton insurance.
[01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:13.078]  You see, perhaps that is what's going on here.
[01:13:13.519 --> 01:13:15.463]  Trump is a shrewd poker player.
[01:13:16.101 --> 01:13:26.785]  Perhaps he understands that if he expressed a desire to move ahead aggressively today on the question of the prosecution, that they would get an immediate pardon and therefore would legally evade justice.
[01:13:27.306 --> 01:13:29.847]  So maybe that is what he's building.
[01:13:29.887 --> 01:13:31.087]  Never second-guess him.
[01:13:31.527 --> 01:13:32.828]  I learned that a long time ago.
[01:13:34.969 --> 01:13:37.590]  I think at the end of the day, it may be premature.
[01:13:37.650 --> 01:13:43.512]  Now, I saw on InfoWars that Chelsea had lobbied one of the Trump children.
[01:13:47.176 --> 01:13:48.757]  So, you know, can't we all be friends?
[01:13:48.917 --> 01:13:51.037]  Is that accurate info I got from one of my other sources?
[01:13:51.597 --> 01:13:53.298]  Yes, it is 100% correct.
[01:13:54.458 --> 01:13:56.418]  I heard it from an additional source.
[01:13:57.059 --> 01:13:59.739]  So, you know that they have a concern.
[01:13:59.779 --> 01:14:01.220]  You can tell they have a concern.
[01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:12.942]  Well, I mean, Sessions, I'm told, from another source, did not take the appointment unless he could have a free hand, and the two men really like each other.
[01:14:12.982 --> 01:14:15.303]  And the word is, Sessions is going to have a true free hand.
[01:14:17.133 --> 01:14:24.859]  Yes, I think that's true, which in one sense I'm happy to get a quote on the question of legalized marijuana.
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:37.369]  It's havoc to certainly enforce the state law in the states that are already legally have... Sure, I don't agree with Sessions on the whole drug war thing, but you can't throw the baby out with the bathwater.
[01:14:37.389 --> 01:14:38.650]  We're going to break here in a few minutes.
[01:14:39.251 --> 01:14:42.634]  Looking at this then, starting to get into this now,
[01:14:43.851 --> 01:14:45.492]  We'll get into recount coming up in the next segment.
[01:14:46.272 --> 01:14:59.941]  From what I've seen in the tea leaves, in the news, with Bannon coming out public, with Conway coming out public, obviously myself and others coming out public, I mean it looks like Trump is getting the fact that Mitt Romney is really like a turd in the punch bowl.
[01:15:01.682 --> 01:15:08.206]  This week it has not gotten rave reviews from the grassroots.
[01:15:08.346 --> 01:15:10.187]  The real question of course is where is
[01:15:10.951 --> 01:15:12.812]  Reince Priebus in this.
[01:15:12.932 --> 01:15:19.037]  Reince is, after all, you know, was chairman of the party when Romney was the nominee, and they are close friends.
[01:15:19.137 --> 01:15:31.825]  So he is denied to several media outlets that he is an advocate for this, but my intelligence wise, I think that's how perfunctory hello got to be this.
[01:15:32.106 --> 01:15:34.107]  I don't think this is serving the president well.
[01:15:34.127 --> 01:15:38.290]  He needs somebody who shares his worldview, and that's not Mitt.
[01:15:38.370 --> 01:15:40.091]  He needs somebody who has to denigrate.
[01:15:40.885 --> 01:15:43.927]  All right, Roger Stone of StoneColdTruth.com is our guest.
[01:15:44.367 --> 01:15:44.988]  He's on cell phone.
[01:15:45.008 --> 01:15:46.148]  I don't know if he's out on the road or what.
[01:15:46.168 --> 01:15:48.610]  I'm going to try to see if we can do audio Skype when we come back.
[01:15:48.650 --> 01:15:50.591]  But regardless, we're going to come back with Roger Stone on the other side.
[01:15:50.971 --> 01:15:51.612]  I'm Alex Jones.

[01:16:09.178 --> 01:16:13.340]  I mentioned this on the show before, bringing back life to the inner cities in America.
[01:16:13.761 --> 01:16:16.022]  Of course, that means bringing jobs back home.
[01:16:16.622 --> 01:16:26.828]  But you know, the other day I looked on a search engine and I found in Chicago, not just an urban farm, but a directory of urban farms.
[01:16:27.368 --> 01:16:37.814]  I saw at least eight of these local operations that are all geared to growing fresh nutritious food for people by people who live there and so on and so forth.
[01:16:38.534 --> 01:16:40.116]  That's a revolution, right there.
[01:16:41.177 --> 01:16:48.006]  Let's put 100, 1,000, 5,000 of these urban farms in inner cities across America for a pittance.
[01:16:48.847 --> 01:16:51.750]  People themselves could form them as businesses and make money.
[01:16:52.311 --> 01:16:55.074]  If Trump is listening to this, here's a clue.
[01:16:55.494 --> 01:16:57.397]  You want to bring back inner cities?
[01:16:58.189 --> 01:17:08.511]  Of course you offer people jobs, good jobs, and also programs like this that for a tiny amount of money can reverse life completely in these inner cities.
[01:17:09.131 --> 01:17:22.454]  So I think that the new administration in Washington, if they have a clue about anything, and they seem to, are going to be listening to people like us because we've been looking at solutions all along.
[01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:24.370]  This is nothing new for us.
[01:17:24.450 --> 01:17:30.332]  Just point out to the people that very quickly they can make this into a profit making business of their own.
[01:17:30.773 --> 01:17:36.155]  So they can eat fresh nutritious food that they grow for nothing and then they can sell the food.
[01:17:36.756 --> 01:17:40.457]  And all of a sudden you've got free market coming back into the inner cities.
[01:17:40.577 --> 01:17:43.639]  And my feeling is, and I mentioned this to a couple of friends yesterday,
[01:17:44.654 --> 01:17:51.817]  If you're living in an inner city and all of a sudden it starts to blossom with, you know, one of these, several of these enterprises.
[01:17:52.678 --> 01:17:54.039]  Growing food, naturally.
[01:17:54.119 --> 01:17:55.219]  Growing it outdoors.
[01:17:55.299 --> 01:17:56.900]  Growing it in abandoned buildings.
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:58.481]  Growing it in all kinds of places.
[01:17:59.281 --> 01:18:05.604]  Now, the people that live there are invested in that community in a way that they've never been before in their memory.
[01:18:06.424 --> 01:18:11.027]  Now they're feeding themselves and growing food and selling the food and making a profit.
[01:18:11.387 --> 01:18:12.147]  They're in business.
[01:18:12.747 --> 01:18:13.308]  And now,
[01:18:14.703 --> 01:18:15.795]  Their demand.
[01:18:17.435 --> 01:18:29.284]  The level of their demand to live in a safe community, free of thugs and gangs and drugs and so forth, reaches a new peak level that it's never been at before.
[01:18:29.864 --> 01:18:34.728]  This is not just, I want the freedom to be able to go down to the A.M.P.M.
[01:18:34.768 --> 01:18:36.990]  because that's the only store that's there.
[01:18:37.530 --> 01:18:38.151]  You know, no.
[01:18:38.711 --> 01:18:45.036]  We've got something to protect now that's real, that's feeding us and making us money on a true product.
[01:18:45.556 --> 01:18:49.038]  Now you're going to see life in those inner cities completely transformed.
[01:18:49.198 --> 01:19:00.585]  What solutions can we feed this new movement that has developed using Trump in a way as a symbol, you know, whatever else you want to say.
[01:19:00.605 --> 01:19:01.166]  A battering ram.
[01:19:02.146 --> 01:19:04.628]  A battering ram, the movement is gigantic.
[01:19:04.808 --> 01:19:06.909]  It got its legs under it with Ron Paul.
[01:19:07.389 --> 01:19:08.910]  These are many of the same people.
[01:19:09.170 --> 01:19:19.537]  If you ever wanted to live off the grid and produce your own clean energy in a silent, reliable way, this is a message you want to pay very close attention to.
[01:19:20.057 --> 01:19:30.661]  Thanks to a new development in solar generator technology, it's now possible for my listeners and viewers to produce their own source of emergency backup electricity.
[01:19:31.081 --> 01:19:34.082]  And even more importantly, it's now extremely affordable.
[01:19:34.482 --> 01:19:40.384]  Thanks to the guys at Solutions for Science, you can get one of these $6,000 solar generators for less than $1,500.
[01:19:42.845 --> 01:19:45.206]  We have these units at the office and at my home.
[01:19:45.546 --> 01:19:50.928]  I can run my sump pumps, my shortwave radios, all of my devices, and even keep our food from spoiling.

[01:19:56.529 --> 01:20:00.250]  Folks, there has never been a better time to get off the grid.
[01:20:00.610 --> 01:20:04.912]  It's going to be crucial in 2017, maybe even life-saving.
[01:20:05.212 --> 01:20:07.313]  Powergridchaos.com for 70% off.
[01:20:12.972 --> 01:20:15.673]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:30.718 --> 01:20:34.179]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:20:34.799 --> 01:20:36.639]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:49.775 --> 01:20:54.364]  Donald Trump on his Twitter calls Roger Stone loyal and tough.
[01:20:54.525 --> 01:20:55.767]  And that is certainly the case.
[01:20:55.787 --> 01:20:56.388]  Great guy.
[01:20:57.070 --> 01:20:57.931]  Works harder than I do.
[01:20:57.992 --> 01:20:59.996]  It makes my head spin how at his age he can do it.
[01:21:02.008 --> 01:21:03.529]  He's with us for one more segment after this.
[01:21:03.569 --> 01:21:13.156]  Then I'm going to get to Donald Trump and a rare video from Fox 9, the number one channel in New York, on 9-11 saying bombs in the buildings.
[01:21:13.196 --> 01:21:16.679]  Wow, just adds more credibility to Donald Trump because there were bombs in the buildings.
[01:21:16.719 --> 01:21:17.520]  I've talked to the firefighters.
[01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:19.621]  We don't know who planted them or what was happening.
[01:21:19.641 --> 01:21:22.443]  We just know there's a cover-up, but amazing.
[01:21:22.483 --> 01:21:24.125]  It just makes me like Donald Trump that much more.
[01:21:24.685 --> 01:21:28.728]  Finishing up with Romney, because your audio was cutting out a bit, Roger Stone of StoneColdTruth.com.
[01:21:28.748 --> 01:21:33.371]  I want to add you're now hosting a once a week show in the fourth hour, Wednesdays in my fourth hour.
[01:21:33.391 --> 01:21:35.273]  This Wednesday you're going to be hosting for two hours.
[01:21:36.013 --> 01:21:37.694]  Very excited about that.
[01:21:38.475 --> 01:21:41.237]  And soon I'll be adding more shows here in my own network.
[01:21:41.557 --> 01:21:42.638]  This will all be with GCN.
[01:21:42.658 --> 01:21:46.620]  They'll syndicate my show, but I'm going to add more broadcasts here with quality folks like Roger Stone.
[01:21:47.081 --> 01:21:50.063]  But just briefly, I want to get into the whole recount and the big enchiladas, obviously.
[01:21:51.724 --> 01:21:59.864]  I know we don't want to be wrong, only Trump knows, but it does seem like that the sun is setting a bit on Romney, or am I wrong?
[01:22:01.269 --> 01:22:09.811]  Well, Alex, it is my understanding that Romney will see the president-elect on Tuesday, so I think we will know shortly.
[01:22:10.752 --> 01:22:17.533]  But I think that the grassroots reaction to it is something the president can't fail to be seeing.
[01:22:17.633 --> 01:22:27.516]  Now, I'm not going to suggest what he should do, not tell him what to do, but I've outlined all the reasons here and elsewhere that why Romney is a bad idea.
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:33.450]  His bellicose position on Russia, his personal assaults and insults to Donald Trump.
[01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:35.634]  Big laughs of Ted Kennedy.
[01:22:36.701 --> 01:22:39.522]  And working against us in Utah.
[01:22:40.382 --> 01:22:45.323]  And I think Rudy would be a superior appointment, if that is the choice.
[01:22:46.004 --> 01:22:48.524]  What about Petraeus?
[01:22:49.144 --> 01:22:51.925]  Well, Petraeus, that would be an interesting pick.
[01:22:52.105 --> 01:23:01.228]  I mean, it would certainly make it very hard not to prosecute Hillary going forward, if General Petraeus got this job, because it would highlight his conviction.
[01:23:01.468 --> 01:23:05.649]  Well, sure, he's not perfect, but he didn't ride Obamacare and he didn't call Trump a con artist.
[01:23:06.704 --> 01:23:13.645]  Well, and he didn't make documents available to former foreign countries through an unsecure server.
[01:23:13.665 --> 01:23:19.186]  Well, my word is, from really high-level patriots, is that Petraeus tried to clean up the CIA, and that's why they did that to him.
[01:23:22.287 --> 01:23:30.548]  I think that he probably was set up, but look, his transgression is not nearly as egregious as what Hillary is doing.
[01:23:30.768 --> 01:23:32.108]  It's not one-one-hundred-thousandth.
[01:23:32.229 --> 01:23:34.589]  I mean, it literally is like not even on the same universe.
[01:23:35.572 --> 01:23:39.314]  And this shows you the inequity here.
[01:23:40.354 --> 01:23:44.096]  Wasn't the lesson of Watergate that no one is above the law?
[01:23:44.156 --> 01:23:45.757]  Isn't that what they said endlessly?
[01:23:46.777 --> 01:23:47.157]  That's right.
[01:23:47.217 --> 01:23:48.238]  Okay, I interrupted you with that.
[01:23:48.278 --> 01:23:50.439]  Let's get into the big enchilada, as you were saying.
[01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:54.841]  What, in your research view, is behind this recount that Hillary's now joined?
[01:23:54.861 --> 01:23:56.461]  She swore she wouldn't join it.
[01:23:56.501 --> 01:23:57.302]  What's behind that?
[01:23:58.362 --> 01:24:00.003]  Well, Alex, let's look at this for a moment.
[01:24:00.023 --> 01:24:01.984]  There's two ironic things going on here.
[01:24:02.569 --> 01:24:12.335]  When I wrote for The Hill newspaper a long piece on the fact that I was concerned that these computerized voting machines can easily be hacked.
[01:24:12.395 --> 01:24:14.656]  You were a total kook, it didn't exist, no such thing.
[01:24:14.696 --> 01:24:15.397]  Now she's saying that.
[01:24:15.517 --> 01:24:15.777]  Right.
[01:24:16.277 --> 01:24:20.720]  Now, suddenly the shoe's on the other foot and they're demanding a recount.
[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:23.522]  Clearly Jill Stein is fronting for someone
[01:24:24.142 --> 01:24:31.465]  She was unable to raise $5 million for her presidential campaign, but she raised $5 million overnight for a recount.
[01:24:32.405 --> 01:24:33.446]  It's now $7 million.
[01:24:34.506 --> 01:24:38.788]  The recount is unnecessary, I guess I should say, in any two-day period.
[01:24:39.568 --> 01:24:41.209]  She raised $5 million in two days.
[01:24:41.309 --> 01:24:43.670]  This didn't come from the grassroots.
[01:24:43.710 --> 01:24:46.691]  This probably came from some Hillary bot.
[01:24:46.911 --> 01:24:49.953]  Oh, they admit that, and she's only going after states Trump won.
[01:24:50.013 --> 01:24:50.693]  How obvious is that?
[01:24:51.775 --> 01:25:09.468]  Well, but what's interesting in Wisconsin is the analysis of Nate Silver, formerly of the New York Times, who points out that the inconsistencies between the returns in the paper ballots and the computerized machines is explained by demographics, not device.
[01:25:10.268 --> 01:25:13.851]  Of course, rural areas are more likely to have paper ballots.
[01:25:15.306 --> 01:25:20.951]  I mean, I don't think there's anything to recount here.
[01:25:21.331 --> 01:25:25.295]  They would have to, by my arithmetic, flip, I guess, three states.
[01:25:26.175 --> 01:25:28.297]  And that's just not going to happen.
[01:25:28.578 --> 01:25:31.620]  I don't think Trump's victory is insecure anyplace.
[01:25:32.101 --> 01:25:37.726]  So this is a last-minute dodge by Soros and the boys to try to hijack this.
[01:25:40.666 --> 01:25:47.653]  And by the way, I'm queuing up the clip of her during the debate saying she would never challenge the election and that Trump was insane.
[01:25:47.894 --> 01:25:48.815]  So how does she do this now?
[01:25:50.153 --> 01:25:51.194]  That's exactly right.
[01:25:51.274 --> 01:25:59.441]  That's the other half of this, which is they excoriated him for not blindly saying, I'll accept the results of the election, even if I don't know if there's been cheating.
[01:25:59.981 --> 01:26:08.007]  And when he wouldn't say that, they went crazy saying he was tearing at the very fabric of American democracy, that he was undermining our democratic process.
[01:26:08.027 --> 01:26:08.207]  Sure.
[01:26:08.568 --> 01:26:10.409]  But now, the shoe's on the other foot.
[01:26:10.429 --> 01:26:13.051]  It just shows you what ethic hypocrites the Clintons are.
[01:26:13.091 --> 01:26:13.371]  I agree.
[01:26:13.391 --> 01:26:14.733]  So let me ask you quick questions here.
[01:26:16.009 --> 01:26:17.090]  What is the real strategy?
[01:26:17.110 --> 01:26:19.832]  Is it just to embarrass him, make it look like he's not really the president?
[01:26:20.132 --> 01:26:23.574]  Or is it really trying to get the electors to admit they're getting death-threatened, guns pointed at them?
[01:26:23.594 --> 01:26:28.317]  I mean, that's even, you know, in the New York Times, World Net Daily's reporting on it.
[01:26:28.677 --> 01:26:32.399]  They're getting threats everywhere, and we won't know, I guess, until the 19th or the 20th of December.
[01:26:35.141 --> 01:26:37.503]  Yeah, I think that is exactly right.
[01:26:37.563 --> 01:26:41.125]  Look, I think this week is going to tell us a lot in terms of
[01:26:44.791 --> 01:26:47.816]  I think you're going to get a Secretary of the Interior this week.
[01:26:47.836 --> 01:26:50.319]  I think you're going to get a Secretary of State this week.
[01:26:51.541 --> 01:26:52.904]  And those are pivotal.
[01:26:52.924 --> 01:26:55.287]  I mean, Trump has made a lot of pledges regarding
[01:26:57.177 --> 01:27:04.364]  You know, federal lands and easing up on control of federal lands, and people are going to be seeing whether he is going to fulfill his commitments.
[01:27:05.104 --> 01:27:05.865]  All right, stay there.
[01:27:05.885 --> 01:27:08.087]  We're going to come back in a final segment with Roger Stone.
[01:27:08.427 --> 01:27:17.556]  I want to play a clip, though, of Hillary during a debate with then-candidate, Republican nominee for President Donald Trump, breaking down election results.
[01:27:17.576 --> 01:27:17.917]  Here it is.
[01:27:18.442 --> 01:27:21.963]  Well, Chris, let me respond to that because that's horrifying.
[01:27:21.983 --> 01:27:30.424]  You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is is rigged against him.
[01:27:30.484 --> 01:27:34.025]  The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my emails.
[01:27:34.085 --> 01:27:35.965]  They concluded there was no case.
[01:27:36.305 --> 01:27:37.706]  He said the FBI was rigged.
[01:27:38.206 --> 01:27:39.726]  He lost the Iowa caucus.
[01:27:39.746 --> 01:27:41.446]  He lost the Wisconsin primary.
[01:27:41.926 --> 01:27:44.347]  He said the Republican primary was rigged against him.
[01:27:45.481 --> 01:27:48.983]  Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering.
[01:27:49.523 --> 01:27:53.025]  He claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him.
[01:27:53.986 --> 01:28:02.831]  There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.
[01:28:03.371 --> 01:28:05.894]  This is a mindset.
[01:28:06.214 --> 01:28:07.816]  This is how Donald thinks.
[01:28:08.117 --> 01:28:11.320]  And it's funny, but it's also really troubling.
[01:28:11.961 --> 01:28:14.504]  That is not the way our democracy works.
[01:28:14.544 --> 01:28:15.625]  We've been around for 240 years.
[01:28:15.705 --> 01:28:20.811]  Okay, so Roger, we're going to wait 40 seconds, but I mean, this is just outrageous that she's joining this whole deal.
[01:28:20.851 --> 01:28:22.513]  Again, what do you think they're really trying to get here?
[01:28:24.059 --> 01:28:26.180]  Um, look, I think it's a last ditch effect.
[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:28.662]  Maybe they are concerned about going to jail.
[01:28:29.242 --> 01:28:41.470]  Maybe they aren't really buying the assurances of the president, which I think are heartfelt to try to heal the nation, but probably premature in view of the fact that we don't even have a catalog of their crimes.
[01:28:42.251 --> 01:28:45.174]  These people are, you know, they're operators.
[01:28:45.234 --> 01:28:45.894]  They're grifters.
[01:28:45.974 --> 01:28:48.036]  They will never, ever give up.
[01:28:48.556 --> 01:28:51.759]  Soros is not going to abandon his goal.
[01:28:51.859 --> 01:28:52.259]  That's right.
[01:28:52.359 --> 01:28:54.781]  They think we're all dumb and they're never going to give up.
[01:28:54.801 --> 01:28:56.202]  We've got to run them over politically.
[01:28:56.562 --> 01:28:57.583]  Roger Stone's our guest.
[01:28:57.623 --> 01:28:59.425]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[01:28:59.445 --> 01:29:00.506]  They're censoring that site.
[01:29:00.846 --> 01:29:01.706]  They don't want that out.
[01:29:01.747 --> 01:29:02.367]  They're attacking it.
[01:29:02.387 --> 01:29:03.428]  The President's attacking it.
[01:29:03.608 --> 01:29:04.429]  Hillary's attacking it.
[01:29:04.489 --> 01:29:05.730]  Spread those links, folks.
[01:29:06.150 --> 01:29:08.392]  It's coffin nails politically to these dirtbags.
[01:29:09.565 --> 01:29:21.633]  The first try was the League of Nations, the second try was the United Nations, and the third try is now to make the United Nations the full world government that was intended.
[01:29:21.793 --> 01:29:31.060]  Most of the nations in the United Nations and in the European Union are members of the ruling parties, are members of the Socialist International.
[01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:41.686]  When they start talking about globalism, they try to soften it by talking about, well, we're talking about globalization and about increased trade and cooperation among nations.
[01:29:41.746 --> 01:29:43.407]  No, they're not talking about cooperation.
[01:29:43.427 --> 01:29:46.769]  They're talking about coercion, of building global governance.
[01:29:46.909 --> 01:29:56.432]  Global institutions that will have world power, legislative, executive, judicial power, military and police power to override nation states.
[01:29:56.532 --> 01:30:00.533]  First of all, to erode and then destroy national sovereignty.
[01:30:00.654 --> 01:30:13.998]  They do not want a United States with a constitutionally limited government being able to in any way resist their plans for global governance, which is total takeover of the financial, political,
[01:30:14.378 --> 01:30:23.765]  Educational, all systems, everything that we rely on as part of our culture and our economy and our government, they want that to be all under global controls.
[01:30:24.005 --> 01:30:28.828]  They cannot allow us to continue running our own lives.
[01:30:29.148 --> 01:30:31.410]  And that's what national sovereignty, of course.
[01:30:31.670 --> 01:30:32.310]  is all about.
[01:30:32.370 --> 01:30:41.112]  And so you see Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Henry Kissinger constantly attacking national sovereignty.
[01:30:41.172 --> 01:30:50.855]  And they say, as President Obama said in this recent article that you referred to in the New York Times, that, oh, we saw World War I and World War II, all of the
[01:30:51.355 --> 01:30:58.078]  The death and destruction that those conflicts brought to the continent of Europe and to all of the world.
[01:30:58.498 --> 01:31:04.601]  It was the result of nations failing to cooperate and he said we don't want to see a repetition of that.
[01:31:05.081 --> 01:31:14.785]  That is the theme of the false narrative that has been given to us in our textbooks and by our world leaders, globalists for the last
[01:31:15.625 --> 01:31:30.351]  Several generations and of course That isn't that isn't true at all the World War one and World War two were actually initiated by the globalists Peter Sutherland of course is the ultimate globalist insider Goldman Sachs
[01:31:31.391 --> 01:31:48.064]  European Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg, all of the organizations, the globalist New World Order organizations that the establishment media says don't exist or are benign, inconsequential, social mingling groups.
[01:31:48.764 --> 01:31:58.973]  And Peter Sutherland and George Soros, with his International Migration Institute, were the ones that put this together.
[01:31:59.133 --> 01:32:09.262]  And, of course, George Soros last year said that the New World Order has to feature China as the center, Communist China, as the center of the New World Order.
[01:32:09.582 --> 01:32:19.646]  Well, Black Friday week has basically come and gone, but we're going to have the specials for one more day, where there was a huge special each day, like 50% off on colloidal silver at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:19.726 --> 01:32:26.048]  Now, all the specials that were one day only are back on this one day only, but all the specials together.
[01:32:26.068 --> 01:32:34.731]  So if you missed out on any of the specials, you missed out on a chance to help fund the Infowar, the final day of Black Friday week at Infowarsstore.com or Infowarslife.com,
[01:32:38.113 --> 01:32:42.376]  And again, thank you for funding the True Tip of the Spear and the fight for human liberty.
[01:32:42.596 --> 01:32:51.041]  We could not have done it without you, and I want to salute you for your support, your prayers, the action you've taken, every race, color, and creed.
[01:32:51.081 --> 01:32:53.923]  We are all red-blooded humans together, and I love you.
[01:32:54.543 --> 01:32:56.465]  And from myself and my family to yours,
[01:32:57.425 --> 01:33:06.896]  I pledge on the eternal altar of God, absolute resistance over every form of tyranny, over the mind of men, to paraphrase Thomas Jefferson.
[01:33:07.136 --> 01:33:08.818]  You've got my commitment!
[01:33:13.504 --> 01:33:16.127]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:22.691 --> 01:33:24.155]  We are on the march.
[01:33:24.536 --> 01:33:26.942]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:33:27.704 --> 01:33:31.333]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:38.152 --> 01:33:40.333]  I'll be back tomorrow, kicking off at 11 a.m.
[01:33:40.453 --> 01:33:43.794]  Central, 12 noon Eastern, for the four-hour weekday transmission.
[01:33:43.814 --> 01:33:46.975]  I cannot stress to you that I'm not trying to act big here.
[01:33:46.995 --> 01:33:47.715]  Everybody knows it.
[01:33:48.115 --> 01:33:50.036]  The President's attacking us as fake news.
[01:33:50.596 --> 01:33:55.398]  The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Sydney Morning Herald, The BBC.
[01:33:57.048 --> 01:34:05.454]  They're really freaking out because Infowars.com, according to Quantcast and Google Analytics, is the 126th biggest website in the world.
[01:34:05.915 --> 01:34:08.136]  And it's only 27% of our reach every day.
[01:34:08.536 --> 01:34:13.740]  We're huge on Facebook and Twitter and Google and YouTube.
[01:34:15.301 --> 01:34:19.625]  And I tell people, during the election we had 85 million people conservatively watch the videos.
[01:34:20.558 --> 01:34:24.721]  The live videos, the tape videos, we just counted them up that week just on our own platforms and a few others.
[01:34:25.822 --> 01:34:27.244]  We can't add them all up, there's too many.
[01:34:27.264 --> 01:34:28.745]  The way the internet works.
[01:34:29.385 --> 01:34:31.867]  Threshold radio went from 3 million a day to like 5 million a day.
[01:34:31.907 --> 01:34:37.032]  Now that went down a little bit since the election, but it's still a whole new plateau of 40 million video views a week.
[01:34:38.664 --> 01:34:39.886]  20 million radio listeners a week.
[01:34:39.906 --> 01:34:42.850]  I mean, we've gone to like 200, I think it's like 50 something affiliates.
[01:34:42.910 --> 01:34:46.835]  I'm cutting affiliate agreements and new promos for stations every day now.
[01:34:47.396 --> 01:34:49.599]  I'm not bitching, but boy, let me tell you, it's taken my life over.
[01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:52.883]  So, InfoWars and its success is only
[01:34:54.542 --> 01:34:57.224]  An example of the vacuum mainstream media left open.
[01:34:57.244 --> 01:34:58.424]  It's not that I'm that good.
[01:34:59.065 --> 01:35:00.386]  It's that they're that bad.
[01:35:00.406 --> 01:35:01.706]  Let me tell you who is good.
[01:35:01.726 --> 01:35:02.447]  It's you, the listeners.
[01:35:03.668 --> 01:35:04.468]  You are amazing.
[01:35:04.488 --> 01:35:05.609]  I want to thank you for your support.
[01:35:05.649 --> 01:35:06.509]  Keep spreading the word.
[01:35:06.929 --> 01:35:09.731]  We're having a huge effect, but the fight has just begun.
[01:35:10.091 --> 01:35:12.013]  Roger, in the time we've got left, I want to thank you.
[01:35:13.233 --> 01:35:32.742]  Co-hosting some this week, doing a lot of great work here with the Syndicated Radio Show, but I want to move through a bunch of points now with you, but before I get into Fidel Castro, before I get into Sheriff Clark as the head of Homeland Security, who I think would be a great guy, before I hit a few other pieces, anything else, any other tidbits you'd like to talk about that I haven't raised?
[01:35:32.762 --> 01:35:35.984]  I mean, Alex, you pretty much covered my agenda.
[01:35:36.084 --> 01:35:38.705]  I'm trying to chart this transition very carefully.
[01:35:39.826 --> 01:35:44.390]  And I think it is also the inaugural committee is going to get off the ground this week.
[01:35:45.170 --> 01:35:53.577]  And it's still a very exciting time with a lot of intrigue as the establishment types try to invade the new administration.
[01:35:53.777 --> 01:35:56.319]  So far, I think they have been fairly unsuccessful.
[01:35:57.620 --> 01:36:00.342]  So the neocon boarding parties, as you call them, have been repulsed?
[01:36:01.723 --> 01:36:02.763]  Well, it's not over yet.
[01:36:02.884 --> 01:36:04.565]  I mean, it's never over until it's over.
[01:36:04.705 --> 01:36:06.927]  And Trump has to form a full government.
[01:36:07.047 --> 01:36:08.708]  We shall see how that works out.
[01:36:10.037 --> 01:36:11.458]  Alright, getting to my questions.
[01:36:11.958 --> 01:36:16.220]  What do you make of Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau worshipping Castro?
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:17.661]  I don't know if you saw it, we have a clip of it.
[01:36:17.681 --> 01:36:20.462]  I'm not going to play it because of time constraints, just saying he's the biggest.
[01:36:20.902 --> 01:36:21.883]  The guy's an icon.
[01:36:21.903 --> 01:36:22.903]  The guy was amazing.
[01:36:23.704 --> 01:36:26.145]  He didn't kill most folks, you know, like other communist regimes.
[01:36:26.165 --> 01:36:27.305]  He only killed a couple hundred thousand.
[01:36:27.606 --> 01:36:28.786]  But he did terrible things.
[01:36:30.027 --> 01:36:31.988]  He lived like a king as his people became poor.
[01:36:32.008 --> 01:36:36.370]  I mean, to watch these leftist politicians worship Castro makes me sick.
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:39.362]  Yeah, look, the guy was a mass murderer.
[01:36:39.962 --> 01:36:41.143]  He was a tyrant.
[01:36:41.244 --> 01:36:44.547]  He was an oppressor of Christians and gays and women.
[01:36:44.687 --> 01:36:45.508]  He was a thug.
[01:36:46.709 --> 01:36:48.651]  And now, frankly, we have to whack Raul.
[01:36:49.471 --> 01:36:52.434]  I mean, this doesn't mean democracy comes to the island.
[01:36:52.514 --> 01:36:55.157]  All it means is that Castro finally is dead.
[01:36:55.817 --> 01:36:59.060]  This guy almost made it from Eisenhower to Trump.
[01:36:59.621 --> 01:37:00.482]  It's quite a run.
[01:37:01.733 --> 01:37:09.058]  Imagine how it feels to see, from France to you name it, leftist politicians like Hollande way behind the polls, Marie LePen way ahead.
[01:37:09.078 --> 01:37:11.219]  You know, the media is saying, oh, it's the Trump effect.
[01:37:11.259 --> 01:37:12.299]  Isn't it really the national?
[01:37:12.339 --> 01:37:17.883]  I mean, I want to give Trump credit, but isn't it the nationalism, the global awakening to globalism?
[01:37:17.923 --> 01:37:20.064]  Isn't that what we're seeing take everybody to power?
[01:37:21.405 --> 01:37:24.667]  Well, I think it is both things.
[01:37:24.767 --> 01:37:26.148]  I think in this country it is
[01:37:27.234 --> 01:37:33.562]  Uh, widespread unhappiness about the two-party duopoly, the policies that have driven us into the ditch.
[01:37:34.102 --> 01:37:36.846]  And the people were just ready for something new.
[01:37:37.386 --> 01:37:40.470]  And the mainstream media miscalculated enormously.
[01:37:40.510 --> 01:37:43.894]  Their attempts to discredit and destroy Trump only made him stronger.
[01:37:44.615 --> 01:37:45.736]  Classic jujitsu.
[01:37:47.237 --> 01:37:59.239]  I'm going to reveal all of this in my upcoming book, The Making of the President 2016, How Donald Trump Orchestrated an American Revolution, which will be out actually from Skyhorse on Inauguration Day.
[01:37:59.299 --> 01:38:03.460]  There's no doubt if he is the real deal, which I think he is, this will be the second American Revolution.
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:07.081]  And by the way, I've already put in the biggest pre-order Skyhorse has.
[01:38:07.461 --> 01:38:09.721]  We will have it here, folks, and then I'll support the broadcast.
[01:38:10.081 --> 01:38:11.621]  But I'm told this book is going to be legend.
[01:38:13.002 --> 01:38:13.902]  It's just amazing.
[01:38:14.778 --> 01:38:16.880]  Getting back to inside baseball, I haven't asked you this question.
[01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:23.404]  I was told this by another source that Obama actually called Hillary that night and then she blew up and had to be sedated.
[01:38:23.444 --> 01:38:24.825]  You told me about her having to be sedated.
[01:38:25.145 --> 01:38:27.127]  That came out even in CNN a week later.
[01:38:27.147 --> 01:38:30.029]  Obama urged Clinton to concede on 9th of election.
[01:38:30.109 --> 01:38:31.630]  Is that what you were told or have you heard this?
[01:38:33.091 --> 01:38:37.114]  I have heard that, but I think they were going by the returns that they had.
[01:38:37.194 --> 01:38:41.097]  This new confection coming out of Jill Stein.
[01:38:41.117 --> 01:38:44.419]  I just don't know that there's enough evidence to justify a recount.
[01:38:44.983 --> 01:38:49.689]  But when I talked about my concerns about the system, I was derided as a crank.
[01:38:50.530 --> 01:38:56.777]  When I talked about the fact that these machines could be inaccurate, I was treated like some kind of pariah.
[01:38:57.563 --> 01:39:01.125]  We may remember Media Matters called on the Hill to never publish another op-ed.
[01:39:01.265 --> 01:39:02.045]  Oh, I know.
[01:39:02.245 --> 01:39:02.946]  I was there with you.
[01:39:03.326 --> 01:39:04.687]  But listen, that's discredited media.
[01:39:04.727 --> 01:39:06.728]  I mean, it's, you know, pox upon their houses.
[01:39:07.888 --> 01:39:10.169]  So even Obama has basically split with the Clintons.
[01:39:10.549 --> 01:39:12.430]  More and more, I'm told, they're totally alone.
[01:39:12.871 --> 01:39:14.051]  They're completely freaked out.
[01:39:14.111 --> 01:39:15.752]  I think they realize that their day is coming.
[01:39:17.353 --> 01:39:19.534]  I think that is true, and they're embattled.
[01:39:19.614 --> 01:39:23.736]  I mean, this is going to be a long haul, but I think we have to continue to make the case
[01:39:24.728 --> 01:39:29.973]  We are a nation of laws, not men, and the grand jury should make this decision.
[01:39:30.954 --> 01:39:31.715]  Alex, I gotta run.
[01:39:31.735 --> 01:39:32.215]  Many thanks.
[01:39:32.455 --> 01:39:33.116]  Alright, thank you.
[01:39:33.156 --> 01:39:34.357]  There goes Roger Stone.
[01:39:34.377 --> 01:39:36.479]  We're gonna go to break here in a few minutes.
[01:39:36.799 --> 01:39:38.941]  There's so much to break down, so much to go over.
[01:39:38.961 --> 01:39:41.704]  This whole Fidel Castro thing.
[01:39:41.764 --> 01:39:43.285]  Yeah, the guy was a man's man.
[01:39:43.345 --> 01:39:44.086]  He was iconic.
[01:39:44.907 --> 01:39:46.228]  He wore two Rolexes on his arm.
[01:39:46.268 --> 01:39:47.029]  Who else does that?
[01:39:47.789 --> 01:39:50.212]  You know, to see a communist actually go out and fight himself,
[01:39:52.267 --> 01:39:53.288]  I mean, I'll give it to Castro.
[01:39:53.328 --> 01:39:54.549]  You know, he was a great speaker.
[01:39:54.569 --> 01:39:55.689]  He was a good-looking guy.
[01:39:55.709 --> 01:39:57.831]  He was a prolific reader.
[01:39:59.552 --> 01:40:06.977]  He also tortured and murdered over 200,000 of his own people and imprisoned millions and lived like a king while this was all happening.
[01:40:06.997 --> 01:40:07.678]  He was a dirtbag.
[01:40:08.098 --> 01:40:14.182]  Now, on the pile of crap that is communism, he was, you know, one of the smaller piles of crap.
[01:40:19.531 --> 01:40:21.032]  Who do you think Roger Stone's talking to?
[01:40:21.593 --> 01:40:24.656]  I know who was calling him in the last 20 minutes of the show.
[01:40:24.696 --> 01:40:26.498]  He had to go when the call came five minutes early.
[01:40:26.618 --> 01:40:26.918]  I know.
[01:40:27.459 --> 01:40:29.621]  I'll get to hear about it after the show ends.
[01:40:30.381 --> 01:40:32.243]  I'm not bragging, it's just weird inside baseball.
[01:40:32.904 --> 01:40:36.608]  I wouldn't care if it was some globalist he was talking to, but if he's talking to the real deal, that's something different, isn't it?
[01:40:38.401 --> 01:40:39.481]  So Castro, U.S.
[01:40:39.541 --> 01:40:44.064]  thorn in cyber 50 years, who survived 638 assassination attempts.
[01:40:45.085 --> 01:40:46.586]  They admit they tried to kill him at least 15 times.
[01:40:46.706 --> 01:40:47.526]  I don't know if it's 638.
[01:40:47.787 --> 01:40:49.748]  That's getting a little ridiculous.
[01:40:50.368 --> 01:40:54.191]  Inside Fidel Castro's life of luxury and ladies while country starved.
[01:40:54.211 --> 01:40:55.492]  Well, at least it wasn't little kids.
[01:40:56.352 --> 01:40:57.073]  That's the New York Post.
[01:40:57.113 --> 01:41:02.436]  I'm not defending him, but... Cuban communist icon Fidel Castro dead at 90.
[01:41:02.836 --> 01:41:03.617]  Breitbart got it right.
[01:41:03.657 --> 01:41:04.537]  He was an icon.
[01:41:05.038 --> 01:41:05.258]  Listen.
[01:41:06.784 --> 01:41:30.658]  One good thing about Fidel is that Che Guevara, who's the communist poster boy, was there in the late 60s and talking crap about poor people and how stupid they were and how people that were part black weren't humans and how the Mesoamericans were quote cockroaches and reportedly Fidel Castro backhanded him and broke his nose and said that's the end get the hell out of the country.
[01:41:31.759 --> 01:41:31.959]  I mean
[01:41:34.062 --> 01:41:36.524]  Che Guevara was a piece of crap, folks.
[01:41:37.205 --> 01:41:50.277]  He wrote books, you can pull them up, there's screenshots in Spanish talking about how Mayatas are retarded and dumb and how the damn Mexicans wouldn't get behind what he was doing because they were too stupid, you know, and all this crap.
[01:41:50.397 --> 01:41:52.640]  I mean, he was a real racist, folks.
[01:41:53.704 --> 01:41:54.705]  And you know, here's my complaint.
[01:41:54.865 --> 01:42:00.990]  Whites now, demographically, are the 16th most unsuccessful group with only blacks behind us.
[01:42:01.730 --> 01:42:04.632]  I feel bad for blacks being one of the most unsuccessful demographic groups.
[01:42:04.953 --> 01:42:08.075]  Native Americans are number 18 behind blacks.
[01:42:08.095 --> 01:42:09.176]  They're the most unsuccessful.
[01:42:09.256 --> 01:42:10.117]  I'm part Native American.
[01:42:10.137 --> 01:42:10.837]  I feel sad for that.
[01:42:12.038 --> 01:42:22.026]  I'm not pissing on people to say that, but man, to constantly hear how I'm running things and how I'm screwing everyone over when the Chinese and the Indians and the
[01:42:23.763 --> 01:42:24.924]  Well, they're like two and three.
[01:42:24.964 --> 01:42:25.745]  Who's number one?
[01:42:25.765 --> 01:42:27.706]  Um, the Lebanese.
[01:42:29.328 --> 01:42:33.792]  You don't hear about, like, oh, Lebanese privilege, or Chinese privilege, or Indian privilege.
[01:42:34.092 --> 01:42:35.853]  These people work 20 hours a day!
[01:42:36.454 --> 01:42:37.315]  They save their money.
[01:42:37.995 --> 01:42:43.140]  For decades, they live ten people to a house when they're already millionaires to buy as much as they can.
[01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:46.362]  I'm just sick of hearing that I'm a bad person.
[01:42:47.604 --> 01:42:49.805]  Are there a bunch of white people living off their grandparents' wealth?
[01:42:50.106 --> 01:42:50.286]  Yeah.
[01:42:52.176 --> 01:42:53.598]  But I watch the decline of white people.
[01:42:53.638 --> 01:42:54.799]  Let me give you the decline of white people.
[01:42:55.139 --> 01:42:56.381]  White people don't have kids, man.
[01:42:57.202 --> 01:42:58.723]  You're not having kids, you're dead.
[01:42:58.904 --> 01:42:59.965]  And I'm not bashing white folks.
[01:43:00.105 --> 01:43:02.748]  I'm just sick of hearing how we're the problem all day.
[01:43:03.048 --> 01:43:04.510]  And I've got all the demographic numbers.
[01:43:05.311 --> 01:43:05.831]  We'll be back.
[01:43:05.851 --> 01:43:06.232]  Stay with us.
[01:43:06.292 --> 01:43:06.953]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:43:18.729 --> 01:43:26.653]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[01:43:26.673 --> 01:43:28.634]  Now, this is our 20th product.
[01:43:29.395 --> 01:43:36.318]  We can easily go out to a major vitamin or supplement company and private label 1,000 different products.
[01:43:36.919 --> 01:43:42.702]  But it's taken us four plus years to even come out with 20, because we private label some, but we also develop
[01:43:43.579 --> 01:43:53.352]  Many of the products originally were some of the top labs in the country, so that they're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe, and they're also very affordable.
[01:43:53.372 --> 01:43:55.515]  Exactly, you talk about being a game changer, right?
[01:43:55.535 --> 01:44:00.181]  You talk about, we're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders, we've both talked to them.
[01:44:00.501 --> 01:44:06.407]  They have conveyor belts of herbs falling on the ground and they have someone come and sweep them up and put them back on the conveyor belt.
[01:44:06.747 --> 01:44:15.716]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[01:44:16.577 --> 01:44:17.678]  We refuse to screw people.
[01:44:18.038 --> 01:44:18.999]  We refuse to do that.
[01:44:19.379 --> 01:44:22.042]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[01:44:22.122 --> 01:44:24.104]  We're producing something we want to take.
[01:44:24.224 --> 01:44:24.885]  Exactly.
[01:44:24.925 --> 01:44:25.965]  We're looking for the best.
[01:44:26.005 --> 01:44:30.869]  We went out and searched for the best to private label, and most of the time found out it wasn't available.
[01:44:31.090 --> 01:44:34.732]  So we go to these big firms and say, we want to make the dream formula.
[01:44:34.752 --> 01:44:40.757]  Bio PCA, for example, one of the ingredients is silica, and it's from bamboo extract.
[01:44:41.038 --> 01:44:42.259]  It's everywhere.
[01:44:42.419 --> 01:44:43.099]  It's in nature.
[01:44:43.359 --> 01:44:45.301]  It's an essential part of being healthy, right?
[01:44:45.641 --> 01:44:51.666]  Just this bottle of silica, okay, again, one ingredient, in a lower amount that's even in our product, is $35.
[01:44:52.847 --> 01:44:58.090]  They're charging more than what we charge when they have one ingredient that's less than ours.
[01:44:58.130 --> 01:44:58.770]  This is insane.
[01:44:58.790 --> 01:45:07.955]  When I told him we wanted 10,000 micrograms, he goes, okay, I get that you guys want to do, you know, high power stuff, but why don't you just do 3,000 and then you can sell, you know, multiple bottles of it.
[01:45:07.975 --> 01:45:08.856]  People will buy more of it.
[01:45:08.876 --> 01:45:09.816]  I was like, no, let's do 10.
[01:45:09.956 --> 01:45:10.116]  Okay.
[01:45:10.577 --> 01:45:11.457]  Compare that to this.
[01:45:11.657 --> 01:45:13.058]  This is a $50 product.
[01:45:13.078 --> 01:45:16.600]  One of the leaders in the industry has 3,000 micrograms of biotin.
[01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:16.820]  Okay.
[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:17.140]  We have 10,000.
[01:45:17.220 --> 01:45:18.261]  This is $50, $48 to be exact.
[01:45:20.742 --> 01:45:22.583]  There's no script, there's no teleprompter, I'll just be honest with you.
[01:45:23.004 --> 01:45:28.248]  My problem is, with 20 products now, it's remembering to take them all.
[01:45:28.268 --> 01:45:32.130]  Because when I do, I have great days, great weeks, a great life.
[01:45:32.551 --> 01:45:41.257]  When I forget to take the X2, a super male, or the lung cleanse, or to do a liver cleanse, or to take this product, my quality of life just isn't as good.
[01:45:41.337 --> 01:45:42.418]  It's changed my life.
[01:45:42.518 --> 01:45:44.760]  I looked like Jabba the Hutt four years ago.
[01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:46.981]  I was swimming two miles some days a day.
[01:45:47.382 --> 01:45:49.724]  I was jogging, lifting weights, I couldn't lose the weight.
[01:45:50.624 --> 01:45:57.694]  I went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[01:45:58.095 --> 01:45:58.856]  It's a win-win.
[01:45:59.316 --> 01:46:00.097]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:46:10.069 --> 01:46:17.577]  The Japanese coastline has been struck again and the Fukushima reactor cooling system, it stops flowing amid the quake and tsunami that followed.
[01:46:17.757 --> 01:46:21.661]  Damaged nuclear plant, it struggles after this latest natural disaster.
[01:46:21.701 --> 01:46:30.611]  Now the cooling system of the third reactor at the Fukushima nuclear plant has stopped circulating water following a powerful 7.3 offshore earthquake this week.
[01:46:30.911 --> 01:46:42.816]  Tepco said that it managed to restart the system some 90 minutes after its failure, and the cooling system servicing the Unit 3 spent fuel pool was not able to circulate water to cool nuclear fuel because of a broken pump.
[01:46:42.936 --> 01:46:45.537]  All of this is according to the Nuclear Regulatory Agency.
[01:46:45.737 --> 01:46:55.821]  It turns out that this plant for the second time has been hit, and the immediate danger, although the agency admitted gradual rising temperatures, the exact cause of this cooling system stoppage
[01:46:56.001 --> 01:46:57.482]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:24.932 --> 01:47:28.413]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:47:29.033 --> 01:47:31.054]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:31.074 --> 01:47:39.557]  Okay, so I have told folks with the Trump operation, not Trump, that over a week and a half ago, I said, look, they're starting recounts.
[01:47:39.577 --> 01:47:41.717]  They're saying that you didn't win the popular vote.
[01:47:42.558 --> 01:47:43.478]  They're going to come after you.
[01:47:43.598 --> 01:47:45.098]  More than 3 million illegals voted.
[01:47:45.138 --> 01:47:46.519]  More than 3 million dead people voted.
[01:47:46.539 --> 01:47:48.860]  It's like 7 million, you add it all together.
[01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:50.420]  That's admitted, even mainstream news.
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:53.001]  You've lost by 2 million, they're claiming.
[01:47:54.255 --> 01:47:58.738]  Even in states that don't have electronic voting, they're putting out fake numbers like Michigan.
[01:47:58.778 --> 01:47:59.759]  You need to watch out.
[01:48:00.139 --> 01:48:00.740]  This is real.
[01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:01.761]  Like, oh, we won.
[01:48:01.801 --> 01:48:02.561]  That's a bunch of bull.
[01:48:03.162 --> 01:48:06.344]  Well, now Trump knows it's serious because they mean business.
[01:48:06.384 --> 01:48:07.345]  He's 54 days out.
[01:48:08.045 --> 01:48:10.067]  They can stage false flags, race riots.
[01:48:10.187 --> 01:48:12.369]  I mean, they are pulling out all the stops, people.
[01:48:13.630 --> 01:48:15.011]  They know Trump's for real.
[01:48:16.171 --> 01:48:18.273]  Things are more crazy now than they were.
[01:48:18.313 --> 01:48:19.114]  We're actually winning.
[01:48:19.991 --> 01:48:20.991]  I didn't even know this happened.
[01:48:21.011 --> 01:48:23.292]  He tweeted about an hour ago, Kit Daniels has written about it.
[01:48:23.533 --> 01:48:29.835]  We're going to add two videos I shot a few days ago, but also a few weeks ago, where I said Trump won the popular vote.
[01:48:31.556 --> 01:48:33.037]  And now Trump's come out and pointed that out.
[01:48:33.097 --> 01:48:36.058]  Trump, I won popular vote if illegal voters excluded.
[01:48:36.498 --> 01:48:38.019]  That's on InfoWars.com.
[01:48:38.039 --> 01:48:40.680]  We need maximum coverage of this article.
[01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:47.843]  President-elect Donald Trump had this to say in response to the ongoing Democratic push for an election recount.
[01:48:49.269 --> 01:48:51.071]  Limits to only states Trump won.
[01:48:51.131 --> 01:48:52.652]  Yeah, again, only the states he won.
[01:48:53.413 --> 01:48:56.075]  And he went on to break down that all the illegals and dead people voted.
[01:48:56.095 --> 01:48:59.678]  And if you count them out, he won by six, seven million votes.
[01:49:00.079 --> 01:49:01.780]  Take two million out, he won by five million votes.
[01:49:02.441 --> 01:49:03.582]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:49:03.622 --> 01:49:06.625]  We're going to have these two videos that I shot on Monday.
[01:49:08.387 --> 01:49:08.907]  There they are.
[01:49:09.007 --> 01:49:13.948]  Proof Donald Trump won the popular vote, and proof Donald Trump won popular vote.
[01:49:13.988 --> 01:49:16.689]  Dems trying to oversee, overturn election.
[01:49:16.989 --> 01:49:25.190]  And what happened is, I shoot a tape feed so I can add documentation, and also shoot a live feed of the tape feed.
[01:49:26.251 --> 01:49:28.611]  One's got a hundred thousand views, one's got a quarter million views.
[01:49:29.131 --> 01:49:32.632]  These things need ten million views to counter the globalists.
[01:49:33.902 --> 01:49:34.542]  So there you go.
[01:49:34.583 --> 01:49:38.185]  I haven't even gotten into where Julian Assange is and how suspicious this all is.
[01:49:39.446 --> 01:49:41.648]  WikiLeaks admit he's on house arrest now.
[01:49:41.668 --> 01:49:42.688]  They basically got him locked up.
[01:49:43.969 --> 01:49:47.232]  They're at that South American embassy in London.
[01:49:48.573 --> 01:49:50.414]  So all that's coming up tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:49:50.474 --> 01:49:51.134]  Central Time.
[01:49:52.015 --> 01:49:56.038]  But this article, Trump, I won popular vote of illegal voters excluded.
[01:49:56.098 --> 01:49:57.259]  That is exactly what happened.
[01:49:58.380 --> 01:50:02.563]  And then you had, you know what, let's add the Bev Harris interview, November 9th.
[01:50:03.922 --> 01:50:07.045]  Where she broke down that Hillary tried to steal an election but failed.
[01:50:07.545 --> 01:50:11.449]  I should probably change the headline because it was like Hillary stole five states but Trump still won.
[01:50:12.030 --> 01:50:16.013]  But let's add that video too because this is key intel for Trump and his people.
[01:50:16.374 --> 01:50:17.595]  They have got to get ahead of this.
[01:50:17.615 --> 01:50:19.196]  They're trying to delegitimize folks.
[01:50:19.557 --> 01:50:20.798]  One of the biggest landslides ever.
[01:50:20.838 --> 01:50:22.760]  Hillary was involved in fraud everywhere.
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:23.941]  Beth Harris is a big liberal.
[01:50:24.682 --> 01:50:26.083]  She only tells the truth folks.
[01:50:26.123 --> 01:50:28.025]  She's exposed Republicans crap.
[01:50:29.657 --> 01:50:31.019]  Over and over and over again.
[01:50:31.119 --> 01:50:33.802]  And she came on my show the day after and she said, look at all these anomalies.
[01:50:34.783 --> 01:50:37.085]  Five states where, you know, it was very close margins.
[01:50:37.586 --> 01:50:39.848]  100% in some areas voting for Hillary.
[01:50:39.888 --> 01:50:41.249]  That's BS, folks.
[01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:44.933]  And it's all late at night, right when they're trying to stuff everything.
[01:50:45.854 --> 01:50:47.556]  They tried the same thing in the battleground state.
[01:50:47.576 --> 01:50:51.220]  She lost, but his tsunami victory was so big they failed.
[01:50:54.349 --> 01:50:55.069]  Man, that's amazing.
[01:50:55.089 --> 01:50:56.430]  So that's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:58.391]  Let's get this article out to everybody.
[01:50:58.691 --> 01:50:59.672]  This is big news.
[01:51:00.312 --> 01:51:02.613]  Let's go to DrudgeReport.com because he's got the headline.
[01:51:03.914 --> 01:51:04.895]  She's back!
[01:51:06.535 --> 01:51:08.757]  Globals were just plotting a week ago for their survival now.
[01:51:09.197 --> 01:51:10.037]  She's back!
[01:51:10.077 --> 01:51:11.618]  Looks like, you know, she's dying.
[01:51:11.638 --> 01:51:13.119]  But it's okay.
[01:51:13.139 --> 01:51:14.380]  She's back in the recount.
[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:16.541]  Something she said she'd never do because there's no such thing.
[01:51:19.482 --> 01:51:22.584]  She is back, ladies and gentlemen, with a vengeance!
[01:51:27.082 --> 01:51:28.963]  Never gonna stop, like the Energizer bunny.
[01:51:29.763 --> 01:51:31.823]  The gift, like herpes, that just keeps on giving.
[01:51:32.143 --> 01:51:34.144]  Clinton campaign will participate in Wisconsin recount.
[01:51:34.624 --> 01:51:39.186]  With an eye on outside interference, lawyers say, I told you, the Russians did it!
[01:51:39.226 --> 01:51:40.866]  That's right, they can barely run their own country.
[01:51:41.426 --> 01:51:43.787]  They got Soros trying to collapse them, but the Russians!
[01:51:43.807 --> 01:51:47.088]  It was in the New York Times, when Infowars is run by the Russians.
[01:51:47.128 --> 01:51:48.708]  Boy, I sure wish they were running things.
[01:51:49.008 --> 01:51:49.869]  Where's the paycheck?
[01:51:49.909 --> 01:51:50.529]  Where's the money?
[01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:53.250]  I gotta go out and figure out how to raise it with great products.
[01:51:53.650 --> 01:51:54.230]  It's still hard.

[01:52:16.507 --> 01:52:18.208]  Whether it's a Bill Clinton's a rapist shirt or
[01:52:24.707 --> 01:52:38.052]  Donald Trump's my president's shirt, or whether it's non-GMO heirloom seeds at incredibly low prices, it's all there, and funding our operation is key to the fight, so I want to salute and thank all of you who aren't just watching football tonight, but are tuned in, actually caring about freedom.
[01:52:38.392 --> 01:52:41.453]  I want to thank our crew, our affiliates, everybody, you're amazing.
[01:52:41.493 --> 01:52:49.956]  Now, speaking of amazing, I was sitting there on Thanksgiving evening,
[01:52:51.325 --> 01:53:04.548]  Thinking about Donald Trump and his wild card, his Trump card of exposing government-sponsored terror and how the Republicans and Democrats worked with the Saudis on 9-11, knowing, I've talked to congressmen and women and black ops commanders and others about what's in the 28 pages.
[01:53:04.568 --> 01:53:06.329]  They've said what's in it, that our government stood down on 9-11.
[01:53:06.369 --> 01:53:08.269]  Well, FBI agents said that at the time.
[01:53:08.289 --> 01:53:09.070]  They were in the newspapers.
[01:53:10.610 --> 01:53:11.810]  Well, I thought the FBI's corrupt.
[01:53:11.850 --> 01:53:13.911]  No, their agents on average aren't, but the top is.
[01:53:14.431 --> 01:53:15.711]  This all came out in the news, folks.
[01:53:15.751 --> 01:53:16.672]  I was on the radio then.
[01:53:16.712 --> 01:53:17.552]  I covered it every day.
[01:53:18.973 --> 01:53:29.120]  And then out of Fox 9, that is in New Jersey and New York, the top station, Trump on 9-11 said there had to be bombs in those buildings.
[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:32.622]  If he was an insider, folks, the word had gone out to cover up the bombs.
[01:53:33.423 --> 01:53:35.284]  The firefighters exposed it, the police exposed it.
[01:53:35.304 --> 01:53:36.805]  I've interviewed firefighters, police.
[01:53:36.825 --> 01:53:38.706]  I've interviewed a deputy police chief.
[01:53:39.047 --> 01:53:40.147]  I've interviewed a deputy fire chief.
[01:53:40.568 --> 01:53:41.328]  Leanne has as well.
[01:53:41.348 --> 01:53:42.729]  One of her interviews has 6 million views.
[01:53:44.770 --> 01:53:45.411]  Look it up for yourself.
[01:53:46.977 --> 01:53:48.398]  So it's a big deal to have him doing this.
[01:53:48.458 --> 01:53:55.324]  It just signifies how independent he is and how he's his own man and why that pisses them off so much and why that scares them.
[01:53:55.664 --> 01:54:00.328]  So here's Donald Trump on bombs inside Tower 1 and Tower 2 on September 11, 2001.
[01:54:03.329 --> 01:54:03.529]  Great.
[01:54:03.970 --> 01:54:10.655]  Donald, you're probably the best known builder, particularly of great buildings in the city.
[01:54:11.155 --> 01:54:23.124]  There's a great deal of question about whether or not the damage and the ultimate destruction of the buildings was caused by the airplanes, by architectural defect, or possibly by bombs or aftershocks.
[01:54:23.144 --> 01:54:24.305]  Do you have any thoughts on that?
[01:54:24.485 --> 01:54:25.906]  Well, it was an architectural defect.
[01:54:25.926 --> 01:54:29.068]  You know, the World Trade Center was always known as a very, very strong building.
[01:54:29.088 --> 01:54:31.049]  Don't forget, that took a big bomb in the basement.
[01:54:31.109 --> 01:54:34.271]  Now, the basement is the most vulnerable place, because that's your foundation.
[01:54:34.472 --> 01:54:35.632]  And it withstood that.
[01:54:35.852 --> 01:54:44.718]  And I got to see that area about three or four days after it took place, because one of my structural engineers actually took me for a tour, because he did the building.
[01:54:44.878 --> 01:54:46.059]  And I said, I can't believe it.
[01:54:46.079 --> 01:54:50.162]  The building was standing solid, and half of the columns were blown out.
[01:54:50.242 --> 01:54:53.264]  I mean, so, this was an unbelievably powerful building.
[01:54:53.824 --> 01:54:57.847]  Uh, if you know anything about structure, it was one of the first buildings that was built from the outside.
[01:54:57.887 --> 01:55:04.411]  The steel, the reason the World Trade Center had such narrow windows, is that in between all the windows, you had the steel on the outside.
[01:55:04.451 --> 01:55:05.832]  See, the steel on the outside of the building.
[01:55:06.292 --> 01:55:09.354]  That's why when I first looked, and you had big, heavy I-beams.
[01:55:09.954 --> 01:55:14.117]  When I first looked at it, I couldn't believe it, because there was a hole in the steel.
[01:55:14.937 --> 01:55:18.979]  And this is steel that was, you remember the width of the windows of the World Trade Center, folks?
[01:55:19.079 --> 01:55:22.001]  I think you, you know, if you were ever up there, they were quite narrow.
[01:55:22.741 --> 01:55:24.502]  And in between was this heavy steel.
[01:55:24.842 --> 01:55:32.946]  I said, how could a plane, even a plane, even a 767 or a 747, or whatever it might have been, how could it possibly go through this steel?
[01:55:33.526 --> 01:55:39.649]  I happen to think that they had not only a plane, but they had bombs that exploded almost simultaneously, because I just can't imagine
[01:55:40.169 --> 01:55:41.890]  Anything being able to go through that wall.
[01:55:42.290 --> 01:55:45.672]  Most buildings are built with the steelers on the inside around the elevator shaft.
[01:55:46.273 --> 01:55:53.117]  This one was built from the outside, which is the strongest structure you can have, and it was almost just like a can of soup.
[01:55:53.457 --> 01:56:08.546]  You know, Donna, we were looking at pictures all morning long of that plane coming into building number two, and when you see that approach the far side, and then all of a sudden, within a matter of a millisecond, the explosion pops out the other side.
[01:56:08.566 --> 01:56:08.666]  Right.
[01:56:09.472 --> 01:56:12.155]  I just think that there was a plane with more than just fuel.
[01:56:12.255 --> 01:56:19.962]  I think, obviously, there were very big planes that were going very rapidly because I was also watching where the planes seemed to be not only going...
[01:56:20.794 --> 01:56:23.376]  All right, the full thing is up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:56:23.776 --> 01:56:33.222]  By the way, I was just sent a tweet by one of our crew members, Matt Taibbi, who told us the Federal Reserve was private and won a bunch of prizes, told us big banks were eating the stock market and interest rates.
[01:56:33.342 --> 01:56:42.288]  Oh my, they told us, Matt Taibbi, Rolling Stone, oh my God, I'm like hundreds of times bigger than you on the internet, according to Quantcast and others.
[01:56:42.928 --> 01:56:44.930]  Oh, but Matt Taibbi, so celebrated.
[01:56:46.383 --> 01:56:47.583]  He's come out with all his tweets.
[01:56:47.623 --> 01:56:49.344]  I guess he's got a new payroll boss.
[01:56:50.264 --> 01:56:54.966]  He says, Alex Jones thinks jukeboxes make frogs gay.
[01:56:55.066 --> 01:57:01.929]  Now, I talked about a New Scientist article about the chemicals in the plastic making humans asexual and screwing up reproductive stuff.
[01:57:01.969 --> 01:57:04.110]  But just say about jukeboxes make us gay.
[01:57:05.170 --> 01:57:09.654]  Yes, Jones really scooped us on the government sending tornado steering weapons.
[01:57:09.915 --> 01:57:10.615]  Never said that.
[01:57:10.836 --> 01:57:11.276]  Made up.
[01:57:11.616 --> 01:57:14.058]  Lady called and said, could this tornado in Oklahoma City be steered?
[01:57:14.078 --> 01:57:17.442]  And I said, Weather Channel admits weather weapons, but no, not tornadoes.
[01:57:17.922 --> 01:57:18.222]  Lie.
[01:57:19.143 --> 01:57:25.229]  President Trump also wants, and he goes on to say, in the tweet I saw, that we're going to have four years of Alex Jones in the White House.
[01:57:27.035 --> 01:57:28.316]  Here it is.
[01:57:28.696 --> 01:57:33.681]  Congratulations America, you've turned the presidency into a four-year Alex Jones broadcast.
[01:57:34.181 --> 01:57:35.682]  The arrogance of these people!
[01:57:36.883 --> 01:57:38.945]  Make up whatever you want, jackass!
[01:57:39.526 --> 01:57:42.248]  Our audience is hundreds of times bigger than you, buck-tooth!
[01:57:43.269 --> 01:57:44.971]  You damn arrogant son of a bitch!
[01:57:45.491 --> 01:57:48.113]  You think just because you run around all arrogant means you run the world?
[01:57:48.174 --> 01:57:49.295]  Real men just showed up!
[01:57:50.051 --> 01:57:50.811]  Get ready for it.
[01:57:50.831 --> 01:57:51.972]  You're going to have a real problem with it.
[01:57:52.632 --> 01:57:53.552]  Listeners, I love you.
[01:57:53.592 --> 01:57:54.113]  Spread the word.
[01:57:54.153 --> 01:57:55.073]  Infowars.com.
[01:57:55.113 --> 01:57:55.533]  They hate it.
[01:57:55.813 --> 01:57:56.614]  Spread that link.
[01:57:56.974 --> 01:57:58.014]  We'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[01:57:59.695 --> 01:58:01.535]  I'm going to lay it out short and sweet.
[01:58:03.176 --> 01:58:08.858]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[01:58:09.558 --> 01:58:13.420]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[01:58:14.392 --> 01:58:16.633]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[01:58:16.713 --> 01:58:17.854]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[01:58:18.534 --> 01:58:21.096]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[01:58:22.076 --> 01:58:22.436]  Or more.
[01:58:22.516 --> 01:58:24.417]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[01:58:24.938 --> 01:58:26.398]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[01:58:26.538 --> 01:58:29.880]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:31.781]  It's actually scary.
[01:58:32.621 --> 01:58:42.647]  And it's because I take products that are researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[01:58:43.741 --> 01:58:44.411]  We've produced these
