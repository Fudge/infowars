[00:00:06.334 --> 00:00:07.635]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.635 --> 00:00:09.396]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.396 --> 00:00:11.158]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.158 --> 00:00:12.759]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:14.300]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.484]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:22.527]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.646 --> 00:00:29.629]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a jam-packed global transmission.
[00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:40.457]  Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is going to be on with us for 15 minutes, coming up in the third hour to get into his audit of the Fed bill, election 2016, and a lot more.
[00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:40.978]  We also
[00:00:41.598 --> 00:00:45.780]  We have Larry Nichols joining us on Inside the Clinton Crime Syndicate, the latest analysis.
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:54.264]  Norm Singleton from Campaign for Liberty on the fight to promote libertarian and constitutional ideas in 2016 and a lot more.
[00:00:54.264 --> 00:00:57.366]  The big news is CNN headlines sell everything.
[00:00:57.366 --> 00:01:00.528]  2016 will be a cataclysmic year.
[00:01:00.528 --> 00:01:03.289]  They're now running that in hundreds of newspapers in the U.S.
[00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:04.550]  What does that really mean?
[00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.191]  Trump says Germans will riot, overthrow Merkel.
[00:01:07.191 --> 00:01:09.612]  Obama's incredibly deceptive State of the Union.
[00:01:09.612 --> 00:01:10.153]  But first,
[00:01:10.973 --> 00:01:17.535]  Did you know the UN diplomats actually can murder people, have sex slaves, deal drugs, and commit any crime they want?
[00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:19.135]  That's what world government is.
[00:01:19.135 --> 00:01:21.316]  The corporation's an elite getting that power.
[00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:23.236]  Here's John Bowne's report.
[00:01:23.236 --> 00:01:39.521]  The United Nations proudly declared on their Twitter account that 2015's most popular book from the United Nations' Dag Hammarskjold Library to be none other than the Ramona Pedrini classic, Immunity of Heads of State and State Officials.
[00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:43.922]  Yes, but the question we are asking is why so many people are checking it out.
[00:01:55.666 --> 00:02:04.097]  United Nations has no proper response outside of the self-important notion that UN officials needed to do research on the matter.
[00:02:04.097 --> 00:02:08.041]  Are they arrogantly bragging or are they really that stupid?
[00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:14.069]  It appears that UN officials are keen on the knowledge of avoiding prison for crimes against humanity.
[00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:20.854]  Meanwhile, the London Independent reports officials have learned about what appears to be a fresh scandal.
[00:02:20.854 --> 00:02:31.643]  Investigators discovered this month that at least four UN peacekeepers in the Central African Republic allegedly paid young girls as little as 50 cents in exchange for sex.
[00:02:32.123 --> 00:02:41.257]  UN employees have been accused of 22 other incidents of alleged sexual abuse or sexual exploitation in the past 14 months.
[00:02:41.257 --> 00:02:48.287]  The most recent accusations come in the wake of efforts to implement a zero-tolerance policy for such offenses.
[00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:55.734]  Other sex crimes have occurred in Mali, South Sudan, Liberia and Democratic Republic of Congo in recent years.
[00:02:55.734 --> 00:02:59.298]  The Saudis must have checked Pedrini's book out repeatedly.
[00:02:59.298 --> 00:03:09.108]  In Saudi Arabia, in what would be regarded as non-existent crimes in a free republic, minimal crimes including making homemade wine, talking about sex,
[00:03:09.528 --> 00:03:19.518]  Driving a car while being a female, or even just having unrelated people in your house, could get you jail time, flogged to death, or beheaded.
[00:03:19.518 --> 00:03:25.004]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Saudi government runs ISIS, runs Al Qaeda.
[00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:32.031]  Does that mean that sometimes these groups don't attack Saudi Arabia to demand more goodies, and more power, and more weapons?
[00:03:32.031 --> 00:03:32.532]  Absolutely.
[00:03:33.305 --> 00:03:34.325]  But that's the real problem.
[00:03:34.325 --> 00:03:36.687]  There it is in the New York Times.
[00:03:36.687 --> 00:03:40.768]  Convicted terrorist claims Saudis funded Al-Qaeda and new a plot to down Air Force One.
[00:03:40.768 --> 00:03:46.391]  It's in the 28 pages that Saudi Arabia was running the hijackers and they were in Saudi intelligence.
[00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:55.135]  Of course, the United Nations' answer to Saudi Arabia's abject cruelty is to give them a key position on the UN Human Rights Council.
[00:03:55.135 --> 00:03:56.476]  Why stop there?
[00:03:56.476 --> 00:03:59.117]  North Korea appears to be overqualified.
[00:03:59.417 --> 00:04:10.987]  Last year, WikiLeaks intercepted classified files between British diplomats and the Saudis, revealing that the UK worked with the Saudi government to get them elected to the UN Human Rights Council.
[00:04:10.987 --> 00:04:15.250]  Meanwhile, in the UK, government pedophilia takes center stage.
[00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:27.641]  While in Germany, the German government children's department distributed millions of leaflets promoting pedophilia while ignoring the rape of its citizens by an unrelenting wave of foreign rapists they brought in.
[00:04:39.207 --> 00:04:40.047]  It's Wednesday.
[00:04:40.047 --> 00:04:56.616]  Simply put, a global crime syndicate disease that makes the rules while breaking those very rules and claiming immunity is quickly infecting your government, your finances, your child's future, and ultimately your life.
[00:04:56.616 --> 00:04:58.697]  John Barron for InfoWars.com.
[00:04:58.697 --> 00:04:59.137]  We'll be back!
[00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:07.399]  Obama is removing obstacles for driverless cars, pushing back against state regulation, clearing the road for Google.
[00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:18.352]  After Google cars were involved in 11 accidents in six years, the California DMV proposed new state regulations to require a human, a steering wheel, throttle and brake pedals on California roads.
[00:05:18.852 --> 00:05:20.233]  Can't have that, Obama says.
[00:05:20.233 --> 00:05:23.275]  Can't have a patchwork of state regulations for robot cars.
[00:05:23.275 --> 00:05:29.178]  Google Car's accident rate would work out to 83 accidents over 45 years of driving.
[00:05:29.178 --> 00:05:33.060]  How many humans do you know that have had 83 accidents?
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.801]  Would you get in their car?
[00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:35.682]  But don't worry.
[00:05:35.682 --> 00:05:37.383]  Obama's just offering you a choice.
[00:05:37.383 --> 00:05:42.346]  Your own personal limo where you can just play on social media and leave the driving to them.
[00:05:42.346 --> 00:05:44.447]  Like Obamacare, with Obama Car,
[00:05:44.847 --> 00:05:47.691]  If you like your car, you can keep your car.
[00:05:47.691 --> 00:05:50.956]  You just won't be able to afford the insurance to drive your own car.
[00:05:50.956 --> 00:05:53.520]  Because, you know, Obama cars are safer than you.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.882]  Right.
[00:05:54.882 --> 00:05:55.883]  83 accidents.
[00:05:55.883 --> 00:05:56.965]  Not my fault.
[00:05:56.965 --> 00:05:58.567]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:06.116]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, you can get six months free at PrisonPlanet.TV, but only for one more week.
[00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:16.706]  We've never offered six months free before, but I really want to get more people to join and to be able to watch The Mountain News, live reports, the special reports, all my films, e-books, and so much more.
[00:06:16.706 --> 00:06:19.489]  One person can share their membership with 20 people.
[00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.191]  We have to have our own platform that is harder for them to censor, harder for the system to shut down.
[00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:26.951]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:26.951 --> 00:06:32.793]  We put out the daily radio show free with a video and audio feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:06:32.793 --> 00:06:40.214]  But it is the members that are paying it forward and helping so many other people see the truth.
[00:06:40.214 --> 00:06:46.896]  And it's PrisonPlanet.tv that finances so much of the cameras, the equipment, the crew, the reporters.
[00:06:47.276 --> 00:06:53.100]  You get exclusive HD higher quality, get it first, and then you can download it, share it with friends and family.
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.464]  It's a win-win and then you're helping finance to put it out for free to everybody.
[00:06:57.464 --> 00:07:00.046]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:00.046 --> 00:07:09.533]  InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winner's Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[00:07:09.533 --> 00:07:14.236]  Winner's Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[00:07:14.236 --> 00:07:16.698]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrients
[00:07:16.758 --> 00:07:17.218]  We're good to go.
[00:07:40.934 --> 00:07:45.978]  Read the facts at InfoWarsLife.com about Winter Sun, Vitamin D3.
[00:07:45.978 --> 00:07:51.903]  Not only does Vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but Vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.
[00:07:51.903 --> 00:07:54.045]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[00:07:54.045 --> 00:07:56.667]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[00:08:18.044 --> 00:08:26.866]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:26.866 --> 00:08:29.026]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:29.026 --> 00:08:40.908]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:08:40.908 --> 00:08:43.668]  Get ready, it's the kickoff of the worldwide broadcast.
[00:08:43.668 --> 00:08:45.429]  Wednesday, the 13th day of January, 2016.
[00:08:48.393 --> 00:08:53.094]  Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is going to be on the show talking campaign 2016.
[00:08:53.094 --> 00:09:04.637]  How does he get back in the lead of the pack, instead of being kicked out of the pack, and his move to continue the push to audit the Fed that is so close, just a few votes away, in the U.S.
[00:09:04.637 --> 00:09:04.957]  Senate.
[00:09:04.957 --> 00:09:07.317]  We've had the votes in the House for a long time.
[00:09:07.317 --> 00:09:10.078]  That is the private banking dictatorship that runs America.
[00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:17.328]  And Senator Rand Paul will be joining us coming up in the third hour.
[00:09:17.328 --> 00:09:21.611]  Norm Singleton of Campaign for Liberty also pushing on at the Fed is going to be joining us.
[00:09:21.611 --> 00:09:22.512]  Larry Nichols!
[00:09:25.367 --> 00:09:27.668]  The former Clinton insider had been on a few months.
[00:09:27.668 --> 00:09:33.752]  He's going to give us his latest breakdown on exactly what's unfolding and what type of dirty tricks they're going to be pulling.
[00:09:33.752 --> 00:09:35.693]  We've got the Iranians seizing two U.S.
[00:09:35.693 --> 00:09:40.455]  ships and the White House won't respond in press conferences now, even 20 hours later.
[00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:41.696]  They wouldn't yesterday or today.
[00:09:41.696 --> 00:09:45.038]  Donald Trump warns Germans will riot, overthrow Merkel.
[00:09:46.331 --> 00:09:54.674]  Over the giant Islamic rape gangs that are being organized in the Middle East and announcing their sexual jihad to breed out Europeans.
[00:09:54.674 --> 00:09:57.915]  This is being announced by the main imam of Jerusalem.
[00:09:57.915 --> 00:10:03.357]  Sexual conquest of the classic type.
[00:10:03.357 --> 00:10:05.838]  So it's all coming up today.
[00:10:05.838 --> 00:10:08.019]  Obviously we're going to break down the over-the-top
[00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:12.641]  State of the Union address.
[00:10:12.641 --> 00:10:25.354]  Again, once my children went to bed last night, once I was done playing board games with them and doing their homework and things like that, I then watched it taped and it was really hard to watch.
[00:10:25.354 --> 00:10:29.698]  I had a transcript in front of me so I fast-forwarded through the parts that I had already read
[00:10:30.856 --> 00:10:40.059]  It's really hard to analyze something like this when everything he said was a distortion, a twisted lie, or a complete ass-backwards fraud.
[00:10:40.059 --> 00:10:42.880]  Excuse my French, it's just true.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.861]  But we're going to be getting into that obviously first today.
[00:10:44.861 --> 00:10:50.123]  We have another big sneak peek of the big interview with Louis Farrakhan next week, where Louis Farrakhan talks about race war in America.
[00:10:50.123 --> 00:10:53.804]  This is exclusive and really should be a news making clip.
[00:10:54.943 --> 00:11:01.166]  Shikari Jackson's put out a very important, really revolutionary nine-minute video on the Second Amendment.
[00:11:01.166 --> 00:11:05.728]  Something that's a major game-changer is the term.
[00:11:05.728 --> 00:11:11.930]  With 3D printable guns, the actual receiver system to print the receivers and things is out there.
[00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:15.112]  And so that's going to be coming up in the fourth hour today.
[00:11:15.112 --> 00:11:20.334]  It is a big broadcast.
[00:11:20.334 --> 00:11:21.715]  And then we have headlines like this.
[00:11:23.061 --> 00:11:29.966]  Obama's Chief of Staff promises, this is a quote, audacious executive action in the final year.
[00:11:29.966 --> 00:11:37.291]  I'm going to get into the State of the Union right now, but first, I just love the trolls.
[00:11:37.291 --> 00:11:46.958]  And the reason I mention the trolls is that if you understand trolls on YouTube or trolls on Facebook or trolls that are on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com,
[00:11:49.286 --> 00:11:50.826]  Over the years we've done reports on this.
[00:11:50.826 --> 00:12:03.888]  I'm going to do one again and show how many of the trolls are actually bots and are real people, but they will spam the site with program bots coming from the same IP address.
[00:12:03.888 --> 00:12:09.609]  And it's institutional, it's governmental, it is PR firms.
[00:12:09.609 --> 00:12:11.650]  And of course that's been in the news for a decade.
[00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:12.950]  It's intensifying.
[00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:17.771]  The federal government legalized spending billions a year in domestic propaganda last year, in early 2015.
[00:12:20.293 --> 00:12:27.657]  And of course the trolls will say that's not true, but it's in the Washington Post, very proudly saying the CIA will work, you know, to control the media and put lies out.
[00:12:27.657 --> 00:12:28.237]  That's a good thing.
[00:12:28.237 --> 00:12:30.639]  You know, they went on to say how wonderful it was.
[00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:34.941]  That was in Foreign Affairs section of the Washington Post.
[00:12:34.941 --> 00:12:36.782]  You can pull that up.
[00:12:36.782 --> 00:12:41.445]  Audit shows Hillary Clinton has the most fake Twitter followers, of course.
[00:12:41.445 --> 00:12:43.486]  Upwards of, what, 70-something percent are fakes?
[00:12:43.486 --> 00:12:44.987]  I mean, this is just how they operate.
[00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:49.832]  But I loved it because we like cultural victories.
[00:12:49.832 --> 00:12:59.237]  And when we have a big director on, or we have a big actor on, or we learn that Kurt Russell's a pro-Second Amendment 1776-er.
[00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:03.039]  He says, I'm not liberal, I'm not conservative, I'm a 1776-er.
[00:13:03.039 --> 00:13:04.279]  I'm George Washington.
[00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:05.760]  Love her.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.382]  You know, and we of course confirm he's a listener and so many others.
[00:13:09.382 --> 00:13:12.563]  And you find out that, you know, the dude's a listener.
[00:13:12.563 --> 00:13:14.284]  Yes, I mean, Mr. Lebowski himself.
[00:13:16.169 --> 00:13:19.672]  It just shows how popular the Liberty Movement is.
[00:13:19.672 --> 00:13:23.175]  Not just the metrics that we're now reaching more than 20 million people a week.
[00:13:23.175 --> 00:13:25.136]  I don't even want to say 28 million.
[00:13:25.136 --> 00:13:27.138]  It just sounds so crazy.
[00:13:27.138 --> 00:13:30.981]  In fact, we're looking at the metrics, it's even more wild than that.
[00:13:30.981 --> 00:13:38.086]  So we're going to have a bunch of experts come in and look at it all, but the graphs are like this the last six months, just straight up.
[00:13:38.086 --> 00:13:40.188]  It is meteoric.
[00:13:40.188 --> 00:13:43.190]  And so Chris Carter comes out in the
[00:13:44.963 --> 00:13:56.889]  Entertainment Weekly and other publications and says, my new show's not really mainly UFOs, it's mainly chemtrails, police state, world government, UN, and it's based on Infowars and Alex Jones.
[00:13:56.889 --> 00:14:02.473]  That's the main focus and Alex Jones will be a character on the show.
[00:14:03.533 --> 00:14:04.974]  Of a different name.
[00:14:04.974 --> 00:14:06.434]  And it's in Entertainment Weekly.
[00:14:06.434 --> 00:14:07.735]  It's in the news.
[00:14:07.735 --> 00:14:10.556]  It's just another sign of the fact that our info is so successful.
[00:14:10.556 --> 00:14:12.778]  It's breaking through like that.
[00:14:12.778 --> 00:14:19.481]  And that Chris Carter would do a major hat tip and say, he's not right-wing, he's libertarian, you know.
[00:14:19.481 --> 00:14:21.002]  I think the UN takeover is a real threat.
[00:14:21.002 --> 00:14:22.882]  I think global government's a real issue.
[00:14:22.882 --> 00:14:24.523]  I mean, he basically endorsed this.
[00:14:24.523 --> 00:14:26.904]  Very exciting.
[00:14:26.904 --> 00:14:31.647]  And I interviewed one of the cast of the show before who came to my house six, seven, I guess eight years ago, sweating.
[00:14:32.725 --> 00:14:41.814]  About eight years ago now, Dean Hagelin literally wanted to tell me in person what he witnessed, and that Chris Carter was freaked out by what he'd seen happen with the CIA.
[00:14:41.814 --> 00:14:42.595]  So I knew that.
[00:14:42.595 --> 00:14:44.416]  He told me, no, no, Carter's aware of your work.
[00:14:44.416 --> 00:14:45.538]  But, you know, that's eight years ago.
[00:14:45.538 --> 00:14:46.619]  You're kind of like, oh, yeah, whatever.
[00:14:47.708 --> 00:14:51.730]  And then the trolls are on InfoWars and on Google everywhere.
[00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.371]  And it's a bot doing it.
[00:14:54.371 --> 00:14:56.812]  Because I mean, it's saying it's a lie.
[00:14:56.812 --> 00:14:58.893]  The show isn't based on Alex Jones.
[00:14:58.893 --> 00:14:59.614]  He's a liar.
[00:14:59.614 --> 00:15:03.536]  He's been caught in a, what was the latest meme they put out?
[00:15:03.536 --> 00:15:06.717]  A Brian Williams moment.
[00:15:06.717 --> 00:15:09.819]  Just like, we have video of Chris Carter.
[00:15:09.819 --> 00:15:11.359]  I didn't even know about this yesterday.
[00:15:11.359 --> 00:15:12.400]  I didn't even watch it.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.802]  You think I'd watch videos, you know, about our own show where they're saying it on video.
[00:15:19.201 --> 00:15:27.806]  So, I'm not going to talk about it again, but later I'll play that clip where the producers of the show talk about a character based on Alex Jones.
[00:15:27.806 --> 00:15:38.071]  It's just, it's like Obama saying, no one wants your guns, or you can keep your doctor, and it's going to be free, and raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit.
[00:15:38.071 --> 00:15:46.036]  And you sit here, and then they look at you with a straight face and go, you're crazy, because you've got the 50 or so clips where he promised not to come after our guns.
[00:15:47.142 --> 00:15:58.385]  But that's what the trolls do because they're PR firms and then they hope to get weak-minded parrots to regurgitate and repeat what they chirped in a snowball.
[00:15:58.385 --> 00:16:05.787]  And it's just wow to really have criminal corporations and our government illegally using our money to do this.
[00:16:05.787 --> 00:16:07.407]  And that's why they're so discredited.
[00:16:07.407 --> 00:16:09.488]  I mean, how discredited are the trolls?
[00:16:09.488 --> 00:16:13.329]  Whether it's Obama the chief troll, the troll in chief, or
[00:16:14.824 --> 00:16:23.511]  Hillary the troll saying they're losing the info war, or the grassroots trolls and the FBI informants and the rest of them.
[00:16:23.511 --> 00:16:26.833]  I mean, what are you going to do when Chris Carter does more interviews saying it's based on me?
[00:16:26.833 --> 00:16:27.934]  You're just going to say it's not true.
[00:16:27.934 --> 00:16:30.416]  And then people know you're a liar.
[00:16:30.416 --> 00:16:32.558]  That's why I've said we want to engage entertainment more.
[00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:36.518]  Because that's really where the big fight is happening.
[00:16:36.518 --> 00:16:37.839]  We've won the news war.
[00:16:37.839 --> 00:16:39.640]  Drudge has won the news war.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.101]  World Net Daily has won the news war.
[00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:43.883]  Daily Caller has won the news war.
[00:16:43.883 --> 00:16:46.765]  We're really winning as true liberals, libertarians.
[00:16:46.765 --> 00:16:52.528]  That means more of your tax money, more freedom, more private property, more family rights.
[00:16:52.528 --> 00:16:53.149]  That's liberal.
[00:16:53.149 --> 00:16:57.011]  It means more, more knowledge, more info, more freedom.
[00:16:57.011 --> 00:16:58.993]  They call that right wing, fascist, evil.
[00:16:58.993 --> 00:17:03.696]  Then they call total control, total tyranny, language control, everything else liberal and loving.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.121]  See how that works?
[00:17:06.121 --> 00:17:09.945]  It's an inversion of reality.
[00:17:09.945 --> 00:17:15.130]  So we're dealing with all this, and then I'm watching it, and I just said, you know what?
[00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:18.894]  About halfway through the State of the Union, I said, I can't watch this.
[00:17:18.894 --> 00:17:19.674]  I'm going to bed.
[00:17:19.674 --> 00:17:21.016]  It gave me a headache.
[00:17:21.016 --> 00:17:22.857]  And so I read the transcript.
[00:17:22.857 --> 00:17:26.201]  Now I'm going to play some of the clips here so it's more tolerable for everybody.
[00:17:27.168 --> 00:17:30.450]  But he says, I've done a great job with the veterans.
[00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:36.193]  It's on record, it's much worse than it ever was, with actual official death list of people not to treat.
[00:17:36.193 --> 00:17:40.935]  I mean, just totally illegal, war crime, Nazi Germany level stuff, on record.
[00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:44.357]  I'm not just saying that, that's what this is.
[00:17:44.357 --> 00:17:46.518]  With a computer that decides when to kill you.
[00:17:46.518 --> 00:17:49.520]  So humans can all say they didn't know what was happening.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.301]  Just like in Nazi Germany, it's run by the same company, IBM.
[00:17:52.301 --> 00:17:54.982]  Cannot, cannot make this up.
[00:17:54.982 --> 00:17:56.063]  This is the real X-Files.
[00:17:57.964 --> 00:18:07.668]  And then he goes on to say that justice will be done and they will defeat the ISIS terrorists, who he openly ran and created with Hillary, and Trump's exposing that.
[00:18:07.668 --> 00:18:12.589]  And then he goes on and says anyone who says the economy is declining is lying.
[00:18:12.589 --> 00:18:19.892]  I mean, the Royal Bank of Scotland, other central banks, world leaders, George Soros' boss, are all saying get ready for depression.
[00:18:19.892 --> 00:18:22.793]  Our experts are saying that.
[00:18:22.793 --> 00:18:26.335]  And he just says, we're the best, it's the best ever.
[00:18:26.335 --> 00:18:27.055]  Cookies and cream.
[00:18:29.502 --> 00:18:31.683]  And it goes on and on.
[00:18:31.683 --> 00:18:46.331]  Then he goes, we've got to fight the rich people and income problems and income inequity when he's telling people they can't have air conditioners or cars and be poor when he's worth, you know, $50 million, the Clintons are worth hundreds of millions, his bosses control trillions.
[00:18:46.331 --> 00:18:48.452]  They're taking over the markets to make us poor.
[00:18:48.452 --> 00:18:54.535]  And then he engages in class warfare in a Capitol building surrounded by fascist regalia.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:04.384]  It's just the epitome of absurdist satire.
[00:19:04.384 --> 00:19:09.647]  It is ridiculous squared.
[00:19:09.647 --> 00:19:12.069]  So I'm going to play some of those clips in the next segment.
[00:19:12.069 --> 00:19:13.190]  Then Larry Nichols is coming on.
[00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:16.592]  We'll play more clips throughout that, getting to what he expects Hillary to do.
[00:19:16.592 --> 00:19:19.273]  Are we seeing the beginning of the fall of Hillary?
[00:19:19.273 --> 00:19:21.955]  Or will he say this is part of the underdog thing?
[00:19:21.955 --> 00:19:22.535]  I don't think so.
[00:19:22.535 --> 00:19:23.756]  I think he's a smart guy.
[00:19:23.756 --> 00:19:26.198]  I agree with most of what she says, but I think she's close to falling.
[00:19:27.148 --> 00:19:28.809]  And I think it's because she looks physically sick.
[00:19:28.809 --> 00:19:30.309]  I agree with Drudge, the other analyst.
[00:19:30.309 --> 00:19:31.570]  She looks like death warmed over.
[00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.990]  I think the wolves are moving in.
[00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.851]  Who knows what's really going on with old Hillary who disappears for weeks at a time.
[00:19:36.851 --> 00:19:40.212]  Doesn't look like that old goblin's doing too well.
[00:19:40.212 --> 00:19:46.615]  But they've got some life extension technologies for these people, so... You know, like Dick Cheney survives heart problems that nobody else does.
[00:19:46.615 --> 00:19:47.235]  What's that tell ya?
[00:19:48.366 --> 00:19:49.408]  Maybe he's dead already.
[00:19:49.408 --> 00:19:50.229]  He's undead.
[00:19:50.229 --> 00:19:51.510]  Count Dracula.
[00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.851]  No, no, no.
[00:19:51.851 --> 00:19:54.094]  That's Richard Perls, the Prince of Darkness.
[00:19:54.094 --> 00:19:54.474]  I'm sorry.
[00:19:54.474 --> 00:19:56.777]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:20:01.345 --> 00:20:03.267]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinowicz.
[00:20:03.267 --> 00:20:05.789]  I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:09.653]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing.
[00:20:09.653 --> 00:20:18.482]  Ten years ago, I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID.
[00:20:18.482 --> 00:20:21.765]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[00:20:22.626 --> 00:20:25.748]  Soon after, it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S.
[00:20:25.748 --> 00:20:31.132]  passports, hotel room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[00:20:31.132 --> 00:20:36.055]  It was then I formed IDStronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world.
[00:20:36.055 --> 00:20:39.217]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[00:20:39.217 --> 00:20:42.299]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[00:20:42.299 --> 00:20:48.524]  Please go to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallets, sleeves, or badge holders you need to protect your personal financial data.
[00:20:49.324 --> 00:20:54.936]  You'll be pleasantly surprised that through our direct sales model, you won't pay more than other comparable unprotected wallets.
[00:20:54.936 --> 00:20:57.301]  It is as though the protection is free.

[00:24:18.647 --> 00:24:22.571]  All these lies are big, fat, juicy whoppers.
[00:24:22.571 --> 00:24:23.812]  Why not?
[00:24:23.812 --> 00:24:30.679]  I mean, if you're going to lie a thousand times, why not lie ten million times?
[00:24:30.679 --> 00:24:38.447]  Obama says we need to call ISIS what it is, but then won't call it radical Islamic terrorism.
[00:24:38.447 --> 00:24:39.568]  See, everything he says is a lie.
[00:24:41.869 --> 00:24:45.531]  Cites Care for Veterans, a success story from his presidency.
[00:24:45.531 --> 00:24:56.697]  They admit that he started six, seven years ago using the Thomas computers with an algorithm to decide who not to give treatment to, even if you were operable and let you die.
[00:24:56.697 --> 00:25:01.720]  It came out two years ago, it was a scandal, and then they said, oh, we're investigating it.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:06.743]  And then a few months ago, the Inspector General came out and said it's worse than ever.
[00:25:06.743 --> 00:25:10.565]  They targeted veterans under Obama and said they're the number one terror threat
[00:25:11.598 --> 00:25:16.661]  Remember the secret document we got seven years ago, and people didn't believe it, and then it came out it was all real?
[00:25:16.661 --> 00:25:21.844]  And Janet Napolitano, big sis, said, oh yes, this is for veterans.
[00:25:21.844 --> 00:25:33.011]  Veterans are the enemy, and now we have all the police around the country on video going, well, the Feds gave us these armored vehicles to fight the militias and the Constitutionalists, because there's a coming war with them.
[00:25:33.011 --> 00:25:35.633]  And they're busy trying to provocateur that actually happening.
[00:25:35.633 --> 00:25:36.994]  Right on time, as you notice.
[00:25:37.967 --> 00:25:41.872]  So let's go ahead and let's go to Obama.
[00:25:41.872 --> 00:25:43.233]  What a great job he's done.
[00:25:43.233 --> 00:25:45.235]  What a friend of the veterans he is.
[00:25:45.235 --> 00:25:46.697]  Here it is.
[00:25:46.697 --> 00:25:55.467]  It's in that spirit that we have made progress these past seven years.
[00:25:55.467 --> 00:25:58.611]  That's how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations.
[00:26:07.509 --> 00:26:21.320]  That's how we reformed our health system and reinvented our energy sector.
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.161]  That's enough.
[00:26:22.161 --> 00:26:32.430]  Oh yeah, they reinvented the energy sector, shutting off about half our power plant and only letting his friends operate and massively increase profits while gouging everyone, making Enron look tame.
[00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:33.691]  Oh, you're such a nice person.
[00:26:33.691 --> 00:26:36.133]  Thank you for all you did, El Jefe.
[00:26:37.404 --> 00:26:38.284]  Let's go to the next clip.
[00:26:38.284 --> 00:26:40.445]  Obama cites the care there.
[00:26:40.445 --> 00:26:43.807]  Obama regrets partisan rancor that he helped stir up.
[00:26:43.807 --> 00:26:45.448]  We're going to play this clip.
[00:26:45.448 --> 00:26:46.688]  Obama to terrorists.
[00:26:46.688 --> 00:26:49.009]  Justice will be done.
[00:26:49.009 --> 00:26:56.472]  To the group that Donald Trump has exposed, we've exposed, the military has exposed, Hillary and Obama literally created.
[00:26:56.472 --> 00:27:03.355]  We have the former head of Defense Intelligence, the top general, coming out saying we were ordered to create him.
[00:27:03.355 --> 00:27:04.656]  I probably played General
[00:27:05.782 --> 00:27:07.543]  Flynn, what, over and over again?
[00:27:07.543 --> 00:27:10.044]  Probably 20 times the last two months?
[00:27:10.044 --> 00:27:11.285]  And now he's had other interviews?
[00:27:11.285 --> 00:27:14.667]  But you say justice will be done.
[00:27:14.667 --> 00:27:18.389]  Are your ears burning when you're talking about yourself?
[00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:26.034]  To the very kingpin, the daddy, if anybody's the daddy of ISIS, it's Obama.
[00:27:26.034 --> 00:27:28.315]  The great granddaddy is Saudi Arabia.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:47.844]  And George Soros, they came together to give us this, and then you're the daddy, and you and Hillary at the State Department, you had your sweet little Jihad baby, and now your baby that you give all the weapons to, that you feed and protect and try to block the Russians from attacking?
[00:27:47.844 --> 00:27:52.066]  You're now saying that justice will be done to your son?
[00:27:52.066 --> 00:27:56.627]  Your son that came out of mommy's tummy?
[00:27:56.627 --> 00:27:57.707]  Let's go ahead and go to that club.
[00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:13.679]  If you doubt America's commitment, or mine, to see that justice is done, just ask Osama Bin Laden.
[00:28:13.679 --> 00:28:16.541]  Ask the leader of Al-Qaeda in Yemen.
[00:28:16.541 --> 00:28:22.325]  Or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell.
[00:28:24.264 --> 00:28:27.045]  When you come after Americans, we go after you.
[00:28:27.045 --> 00:28:31.947]  And it may take time, but we have more members, and our reach has no limits.
[00:28:31.947 --> 00:28:35.669]  Your reach has no limits because you are who you're meant to be.
[00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:36.209]  Totally sick.
[00:28:36.209 --> 00:28:38.730]  Okay, let's go to the next one.
[00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:40.010]  Let's just go to this super whopper.
[00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:48.794]  I've got another terrorism clip here as well that I have the Pentagon admitting that, you know, he says that they've defeated basically ISIS and that they've been dealt with.
[00:28:49.926 --> 00:28:52.907]  We'll play that later and then have the Pentagon saying it's worse than ever.
[00:28:52.907 --> 00:28:54.027]  But everybody already knows about that.
[00:28:54.027 --> 00:28:55.568]  I just repeated that lie.
[00:28:55.568 --> 00:28:57.268]  But here's one.
[00:28:57.268 --> 00:29:00.189]  Anyone who says economy is declining is lying.
[00:29:00.189 --> 00:29:02.810]  Let's try to squeeze this in.
[00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:07.671]  Let me start with the economy and a basic fact.
[00:29:07.671 --> 00:29:14.973]  The United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world.
[00:29:17.921 --> 00:29:19.983]  I don't know if that's true, because in a weird way it might be.
[00:29:19.983 --> 00:29:20.804]  Let's stop right there.
[00:29:20.804 --> 00:29:24.127]  And he goes on to say how great it is overall.
[00:29:24.127 --> 00:29:30.974]  It's teetering on collapse, but of all the Ponzi schemes, you could say maybe, maybe it's in third or fourth.
[00:29:33.387 --> 00:29:35.589]  But when it implodes, it's one of the worst.
[00:29:35.589 --> 00:29:37.450]  And then here's CNN.
[00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:39.892]  2016 will be the cataclysmic year.
[00:29:39.892 --> 00:29:41.833]  Shell everything.
[00:29:41.833 --> 00:29:45.136]  But Obama says, the point is everything's wonderful is the overall lie.
[00:29:45.136 --> 00:29:46.857]  So it's a lie in general.
[00:29:46.857 --> 00:29:49.639]  Another big fat stinking whopper.
[00:29:49.639 --> 00:29:51.040]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.562]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.562 --> 00:29:56.264]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.616 --> 00:30:06.600]  The first Republican debate of 2016 is this Thursday, January 14th.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:13.045]  And join the InfoWars Nightly News and Prison Planet TV once again for Political Science Theater 3K.
[00:30:13.045 --> 00:30:16.307]  The stage will be getting smaller with only six candidates making the cut.
[00:30:16.307 --> 00:30:19.630]  Maybe seven if they let John Kasich slip in through the back door.
[00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:20.791]  Coverage starts at 7 p.m.
[00:30:20.791 --> 00:30:24.213]  Central on the InfoWars Nightly News and then the debate kicks off at 8 p.m.
[00:30:24.213 --> 00:30:24.854]  Central.
[00:30:24.854 --> 00:30:28.417]  Join us for analysis that cuts through the lies in real time.
[00:30:28.417 --> 00:30:30.158]  When's the next Democratic debate, you ask?
[00:30:30.158 --> 00:30:31.439]  Well, it's on a Sunday during the NFL
[00:30:31.459 --> 00:30:31.759]  I think so.
[00:31:00.191 --> 00:31:04.152]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:31:04.152 --> 00:31:10.474]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:31:10.474 --> 00:31:17.756]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:31:17.756 --> 00:31:26.538]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:31:26.858 --> 00:31:33.041]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:37.864]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[00:31:37.864 --> 00:31:41.446]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:31:41.446 --> 00:31:43.347]  No needles, no injections.
[00:31:43.347 --> 00:31:44.988]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:31:44.988 --> 00:31:46.189]  Try it for yourself.
[00:31:46.189 --> 00:31:48.510]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[00:33:14.255 --> 00:33:16.877]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:16.877 --> 00:33:23.341]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:23.341 --> 00:33:35.548]  I was born in the soul of misery and I never had me a name.
[00:33:35.548 --> 00:33:39.951]  They just give me a number when I
[00:33:41.424 --> 00:33:46.328]  To have microchip identification devices implanted into their body.
[00:33:46.328 --> 00:33:47.209]  Welcome back!
[00:34:06.883 --> 00:34:10.888]  Coming up, we've got Larry Nichols on for about 20-30 minutes at the start of the next hour.
[00:34:10.888 --> 00:34:16.273]  Big Clinton insider on the latest on his analysis of what's happening in 2016.
[00:34:16.273 --> 00:34:23.080]  We have Senator Rand Paul popping in during the third hour on 2016, on at the Fed and more.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.243]  David Knight hosts the fourth hour today.
[00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:29.200]  We have obviously the big news.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.501]  Sell Everything 2016 will be a cataclysmic year.
[00:34:33.501 --> 00:34:35.061]  That's the CNN headline.
[00:34:35.061 --> 00:34:47.624]  Of course we covered this yesterday when it was the quotes from the Royal Bank of Scotland and I saw the trolls again, not that I even try to follow them, I just see it, saying it's a lie, that wasn't said, nothing's happening, he's lying, fear porn.
[00:34:47.624 --> 00:34:50.285]  They have really turned the heat up, which is excellent.
[00:34:50.945 --> 00:34:55.667]  Because it's so discrediting when they just lie and say that we're lying.
[00:34:55.667 --> 00:35:00.370]  Please continue and accelerate and spread the word about us even more.
[00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:08.133]  And I want to thank Rachel Maddow for being in over 500 plus papers over two days a few weeks ago lying about me and just all of you.
[00:35:08.133 --> 00:35:11.455]  It's just really fantastic how you're destroying yourselves in front of everyone.
[00:35:12.537 --> 00:35:27.308]  And Obama saying 2 plus 2 equals 5 and saying he's done a great job with the veterans and how great they're doing with their treatment when he's killing them on record with direct orders through the Thomas computers from IBM and all the rest of it.
[00:35:27.308 --> 00:35:28.489]  So we're going to be going over that.
[00:35:28.489 --> 00:35:30.951]  We're going to be going over more of the State of the Union.
[00:35:30.951 --> 00:35:33.013]  Trump says Germans will riot, overthrow Merkel.
[00:35:34.392 --> 00:35:41.257]  I have an extremely important report, part two of the excerpts we've been airing of Louis Faircon.
[00:35:41.257 --> 00:35:58.391]  We'll have two more of these on Monday and Tuesday, and then Wednesday I'm going to air the entire interview, where I'm trying to reach out to Louis Faircon and trying to have communities come together and not play to the tune of Obama, the globalist, George Soros, that want a race war in this country.
[00:35:58.391 --> 00:36:03.115]  And Faircon agrees that that is what people want, that that's being pushed, and it's very, very dangerous.
[00:36:03.797 --> 00:36:05.978]  So we're going to be playing that clip here in a moment.
[00:36:05.978 --> 00:36:12.179]  Before I go any further, we try to carry the very best products at the very lowest prices.
[00:36:12.179 --> 00:36:17.580]  And ProPure makes amazing gravity-fed water filtration systems.
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:25.342]  You can see the side-by-side breakdowns, how great their gravity-fed systems are at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:36:25.342 --> 00:36:28.523]  Promo code WATER gets you 10% off on all their systems.
[00:36:29.557 --> 00:36:44.193]  But this new ProPure water filtration system is so special, the ProMax 4, because it has a four-stage filtration system that reduces or removes over 200 pathogens and chemicals, heavy metals,
[00:36:45.506 --> 00:36:46.347]  B.O.C.'
[00:36:46.327 --> 00:36:51.975]  's mercury, lead, arsenic, glyphosate, fluoride, hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:36:51.975 --> 00:36:55.439]  He either removes it or cuts it down by 99% or more.
[00:36:55.439 --> 00:36:59.485]  We have the analysis and breakdowns at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:36:59.485 --> 00:37:02.809]  The lowest price on this, 10% off promo code water.
[00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:10.352]  You absorb so much through your lungs and skin, obviously the skin the biggest organ in the body, not just drinking the fluoride.
[00:37:10.352 --> 00:37:17.354]  So you may be drinking purified water, having the right toothpaste, doesn't have fluoride, but you're in the shower like we all do.
[00:37:17.354 --> 00:37:18.435]  Everyone needs this.
[00:37:18.435 --> 00:37:22.456]  I installed three of these in my bathrooms last night.
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:36.409]  And took the old ones down because I always forget about six months, a year later, you know, older filters that reduce but don't cut out as much as these do, the ones we were carrying and the ones we still sell that are lower prices still help.
[00:37:36.409 --> 00:37:37.990]  They start stinking real bad.
[00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:39.231]  You go, oh, it's time to remove that.
[00:37:39.231 --> 00:37:41.913]  It smells chemically because there's so much stuff in it.
[00:37:41.913 --> 00:37:45.255]  So you replace these every nine months depending on how much your water usage is.
[00:37:45.255 --> 00:37:49.098]  And it's got a really good, strong flow.
[00:37:49.098 --> 00:37:50.439]  And that's what's important.
[00:37:51.198 --> 00:37:55.699]  Uh, is that it cuts it out and it has a strong flow and then it supports the broadcast.
[00:37:55.699 --> 00:38:05.440]  Infowarsstore.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.941]  And without you, we're not here.
[00:38:06.941 --> 00:38:13.922]  You really are the key to all this, spreading the word, your prayers, your financial support, and getting great products at very good prices at the same time.
[00:38:13.922 --> 00:38:15.362]  It's a 360 win.
[00:38:15.362 --> 00:38:19.863]  We have a buy Survival Shield X2, the good halogen nascent iodine, uh, that
[00:38:20.203 --> 00:38:22.364]  It obviously counters the fluoride.
[00:38:22.364 --> 00:38:24.484]  It does so much more.
[00:38:24.484 --> 00:38:27.565]  Speeds up my metabolism, makes me more aggressive, more energy.
[00:38:27.565 --> 00:38:28.665]  Just try it, folks.
[00:38:28.665 --> 00:38:33.726]  And get a bottle of Silver Bullet, 50% off our super high quality colloidal silver.
[00:38:33.726 --> 00:38:34.846]  That's the big special.
[00:38:34.846 --> 00:38:37.727]  And Super Male Vitality's back in stock.
[00:38:37.727 --> 00:38:42.168]  And Super Female's been sold out for close to two months.
[00:38:42.168 --> 00:38:43.928]  It's proprietary.
[00:38:43.928 --> 00:38:45.349]  I like it better than Super Male.
[00:38:46.994 --> 00:38:50.437]  It has a few other herbs that the super male doesn't have.
[00:38:50.437 --> 00:38:52.538]  Some guys like super male better than super female.
[00:38:52.538 --> 00:38:57.202]  I've just found that super female is just as good or maybe even better.
[00:38:57.202 --> 00:38:59.644]  So I'll try it for a month, try the other for a month.
[00:38:59.644 --> 00:39:04.787]  I do feel differences and I'll just tell you super female on the libido end is even stronger.
[00:39:04.787 --> 00:39:06.088]  And that goes for women too.
[00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:12.093]  Obviously we've seen the reviews and I've talked to women who've used it.
[00:39:12.093 --> 00:39:23.220]  Leanne, we really need to get her to do a testimonial because she's always talking about it and then never really saying it on air, but I mean that's her volunteering that, that she really noticed it.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:29.104]  But it's energy, everything you can imagine, and it's natural and it doesn't mimic hormones.
[00:39:29.104 --> 00:39:30.305]  What Dr. Group says is it gets your
[00:39:30.805 --> 00:39:34.088]  Your glands to release and to get more balanced, according to him.
[00:39:34.088 --> 00:39:35.769]  All I know is it works like a charm.
[00:39:35.769 --> 00:39:39.413]  It's got almost five-star reviews, like 4.8 reviews.
[00:39:39.413 --> 00:39:42.055]  We have the power of reviews at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:39:42.055 --> 00:39:48.120]  We have links over to that at InfoWarsLife.com, as well as Super Female Vitality for all the ladies out there.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.682]  It is back in stock.
[00:39:50.682 --> 00:39:51.943]  Just try Brain Force.
[00:39:51.943 --> 00:39:54.626]  Just try Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[00:39:54.626 --> 00:39:55.667]  Just try Oxy Powder.

[00:40:04.246 --> 00:40:08.568]  And I want to thank you all for your support and making everything we do here possible.
[00:40:08.568 --> 00:40:10.690]  Please also support our local affiliates.
[00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:14.472]  That means not just spreading the word in this war, but financially supporting them.
[00:40:14.472 --> 00:40:16.293]  Putting up a billboard.
[00:40:16.293 --> 00:40:17.313]  Sponsoring.
[00:40:17.313 --> 00:40:19.615]  Letting sponsors know while you're supporting them.
[00:40:19.615 --> 00:40:21.076]  Send the radio station a hundred bucks.
[00:40:21.516 --> 00:40:24.757]  You don't know how the globalists are trying to bankrupt talk radio.
[00:40:24.757 --> 00:40:28.618]  Big advertisers are coming in and saying, get rid of all libertarian patriot talk.
[00:40:28.618 --> 00:40:31.199]  This has come out in the trade publications as well.
[00:40:31.199 --> 00:40:38.401]  And we will really give you massive institutional funding for stuff that doesn't even make them money.
[00:40:38.401 --> 00:40:42.403]  It's kind of like you see Lockheed Martin ads on CNN for 30 years.
[00:40:44.172 --> 00:40:48.976]  They're not selling, you know, stealth bombers to the public.
[00:40:48.976 --> 00:40:56.301]  That is a payoff to the media to go along with it and not criticize it, just like Archer Daniels Midland Company ads about satellites.
[00:40:56.301 --> 00:40:59.724]  It's all PR with the system.
[00:40:59.724 --> 00:41:02.286]  It's their 20 pieces, 30 pieces of silver.
[00:41:02.286 --> 00:41:03.967]  So you have to understand that, folks.
[00:41:03.967 --> 00:41:05.528]  We have to finance the Liberty Movement.
[00:41:05.528 --> 00:41:06.769]  It doesn't matter we get the ratings.
[00:41:06.769 --> 00:41:08.110]  It doesn't matter we're popular.
[00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:11.353]  It doesn't matter we shatter all the records, and other shows like it do as well.
[00:41:11.353 --> 00:41:12.494]  People are hungry for freedom.
[00:41:13.277 --> 00:41:14.378]  It's called Americana.
[00:41:14.378 --> 00:41:15.638]  It's called Renaissance.
[00:41:15.638 --> 00:41:27.085]  But the system doesn't want it coming to market and being on the store shelves of intellectual debate and ideas because no one wants the globalist poison.
[00:41:27.085 --> 00:41:37.911]  Everything with these globalists is about controlling markets and they want to shut down markets and have monopoly capitalism of ideas, of culture, of religion, one world religion, all of it.
[00:41:37.911 --> 00:41:41.013]  The state is God, the state is mommy, the state is daddy.
[00:41:42.284 --> 00:41:44.045]  It's bad news.
[00:41:44.045 --> 00:41:45.545]  And I reached out to Louis Farrakhan.
[00:41:45.545 --> 00:41:51.568]  I think Louis Farrakhan obviously has said things that I think are terrible.
[00:41:51.568 --> 00:41:54.969]  You know, about certain religious or racial groups in the past.
[00:41:54.969 --> 00:41:56.509]  I disagree with that.
[00:41:56.509 --> 00:41:58.270]  But I don't want to hate the person.
[00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:02.212]  He said a lot of good things I agree with on vaccines, the Federal Reserve.
[00:42:02.212 --> 00:42:06.613]  And I've seen him moderate quite a bit over the years, and I felt like he was growing, and we all grow.
[00:42:06.613 --> 00:42:08.554]  I said things I disagreed with 15 years ago.
[00:42:09.986 --> 00:42:13.430]  And so we reached out to him, and they said, yeah, we're big listeners, please come out.
[00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:23.901]  I went out to the original Nation of Islam headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, where Elijah Muhammad, his teacher, lived.
[00:42:23.901 --> 00:42:26.204]  It's very historical, very interesting.
[00:42:26.204 --> 00:42:31.870]  And spent 45 minutes with him privately talking, two hours or so interviewing him, and then three hours at dinner.
[00:42:33.729 --> 00:42:34.790]  And he just kept talking.
[00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:35.610]  That guy had so much energy.
[00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:39.793]  I wanted to stay all night, but my kids were calling, wanting me to talk to him, so I had to leave.
[00:42:39.793 --> 00:42:40.833]  I wish I could have stayed the next day.
[00:42:40.833 --> 00:42:43.535]  I wanted to come back and talk to him more, but he was busy.
[00:42:43.535 --> 00:42:46.317]  But a very, very, very, very interesting person.
[00:42:46.317 --> 00:42:47.638]  A lot of energy.
[00:42:47.638 --> 00:42:58.104]  And what a coup it would be for humanity if we got Louis Farrakhan talking more about, because he talked about it 30 years ago, eugenics, sterilization, what's in the vaccines, abortion targeting blacks.
[00:42:58.104 --> 00:42:58.765]  He does that?
[00:42:59.565 --> 00:43:05.929]  And I actually find he does do that, but he only gets covered in the media when he says something really incendiary.
[00:43:05.929 --> 00:43:06.709]  That I disagree with.
[00:43:06.709 --> 00:43:09.971]  You know, like, they kill us, we go out and we stalk and we kill them.
[00:43:09.971 --> 00:43:12.492]  And he said the full quote was, the cops that actually do it.
[00:43:12.492 --> 00:43:13.913]  Well, I get that.
[00:43:13.913 --> 00:43:16.154]  But the point is, that's just going to start a giant war.
[00:43:16.154 --> 00:43:17.135]  I get it at a fundamental level.
[00:43:17.135 --> 00:43:22.118]  If some bad cop killed my son or daughter and got away with it, I would have a real problem with that.
[00:43:22.118 --> 00:43:23.578]  I mean, I get the statement.
[00:43:23.578 --> 00:43:23.959]  The point is,
[00:43:24.909 --> 00:43:28.912]  Louis Farrakhan, for all his rhetoric, didn't put cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:43:28.912 --> 00:43:33.515]  And if we can come together on what we agree about, it's a major coup for liberty.
[00:43:33.515 --> 00:43:36.957]  This video just went live at InfoWars.com.
[00:43:36.957 --> 00:43:50.206]  If you are a radio listener and want to actually see it, it's up in the top tiles at InfoWars.com with Louis Farrakhan and the new interview
[00:43:51.229 --> 00:43:53.131]  And again, I just saw it up at the top.
[00:43:53.131 --> 00:43:53.912]  I don't see it there now.
[00:43:53.912 --> 00:43:57.775]  Maybe you guys can refresh in there and I hope it hasn't already moved out of the towels.
[00:43:57.775 --> 00:43:59.958]  It was just up there a few minutes ago.
[00:43:59.958 --> 00:44:03.441]  We got so much news breaking though where he talks about
[00:44:06.041 --> 00:44:14.647]  Stopping a race war in America and pointing out that it's basically suicidal for everybody involved and it's totally stupid and it won't fix any of our problems.
[00:44:14.647 --> 00:44:19.611]  Louis Farrakhan, race war is suicide up on Infowars.com.
[00:44:19.611 --> 00:44:21.652]  We're going to tweet that out right now.
[00:44:21.652 --> 00:44:25.495]  New Farrakhan video, race war is suicide.
[00:44:25.495 --> 00:44:27.916]  We should probably just tweet Louis Farrakhan on race war.
[00:44:28.817 --> 00:44:31.480]  He also says a race war is coming if they have their way.
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.162]  So I'm gonna give you the best headline.
[00:44:33.162 --> 00:44:35.224]  It's probably Louis Farrakhan, a race war is coming.
[00:44:35.224 --> 00:44:36.386]  I haven't even seen the clip yet.
[00:44:36.386 --> 00:44:38.128]  I was there when I did the interview.
[00:44:38.128 --> 00:44:40.871]  I've been so busy I haven't watched it yet.
[00:44:40.871 --> 00:44:43.754]  And so we're gonna see exactly how much of the interview this is right now.
[00:44:43.754 --> 00:44:44.795]  It's about five minutes long.
[00:44:44.795 --> 00:44:46.838]  Here it is.
[00:44:46.838 --> 00:44:48.920]  So if the federal government
[00:44:51.069 --> 00:44:56.274]  Will not intercede in our affairs!
[00:44:56.274 --> 00:44:59.317]  Then we must rise up!
[00:44:59.317 --> 00:45:05.443]  Kill those who kill us!
[00:45:05.443 --> 00:45:09.566]  We want some of this earth!
[00:45:09.566 --> 00:45:12.990]  Or we'll tear this goddamn country up!
[00:45:28.468 --> 00:45:33.830]  As a student of my teacher, I think I should always be dignified
[00:45:35.484 --> 00:45:42.607]  In my expression, although sometimes in passion, I lose it.
[00:45:42.607 --> 00:46:03.497]  And so I thought about, you know, when they said Farrakhan, he wants to kill all white people and he's advocating 10,000 fearless men to go out and kill white people as though I'm insane.
[00:46:03.497 --> 00:46:04.598]  That's insanity.
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:09.341]  And I've been teaching for 60 years, sir.
[00:46:09.341 --> 00:46:30.969]  And no one who follows me has ever gone out and killed a white person, harmed a Jewish person, bombed a synagogue, or even put some swastika on a synagogue, because that's against our religion to deface a house of worship.
[00:46:30.969 --> 00:46:32.669]  I'm saying that to say this.
[00:46:32.669 --> 00:46:32.689]  I
[00:46:35.512 --> 00:47:02.827]  When I said in Florida, you know, naming all the blacks that got shot down, and according to something I just read, where one black man every 28 hours is shot by a policeman, and young black men are nine times more likely than other Americans to be killed by police officers in 2015,
[00:47:04.688 --> 00:47:18.992]  According to the findings of the Guardian newspaper, 1,134 deaths at the hands of law enforcement officers happened last year.
[00:47:18.992 --> 00:47:21.193]  As a black man who loves my people,
[00:47:23.127 --> 00:47:39.875]  I'm grieved not only at police killing us, but I am grieved at our killing of each other, which sometimes is 10 times more than what white policemen have done.
[00:47:39.875 --> 00:47:52.301]  So in my passion against that, and this has been gradually increasing with me over the years, I said, if the federal government
[00:47:53.542 --> 00:47:58.644]  ...does not intercede to see that justice comes to us.
[00:47:58.644 --> 00:48:01.926]  Because that's the government's job.
[00:48:01.926 --> 00:48:05.207]  It's not my job to kill my killer.
[00:48:05.207 --> 00:48:14.511]  It's the government's job to arrest the killer, bring them before a court of law, and punish them for their misdeed.
[00:48:14.511 --> 00:48:18.173]  But when the government fails to do it,
[00:48:20.729 --> 00:48:23.730]  We have to defend our lives.
[00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:29.851]  And so I said, stalk them, wherever you find them.
[00:48:29.851 --> 00:48:37.632]  Not everybody, just the ones that kill us out of the law of justice.
[00:48:37.632 --> 00:48:48.575]  If the government won't arrest them and do that, somehow we're gonna ultimately do that and then it leads to what they'll say.
[00:48:48.575 --> 00:48:50.015]  It's a race war?
[00:48:50.015 --> 00:48:50.175]  No.
[00:48:51.292 --> 00:48:58.474]  We are not in any position at all to engage in a race war.
[00:48:58.474 --> 00:49:00.074]  It's ridiculous.
[00:49:00.074 --> 00:49:02.114]  It's destructive.
[00:49:02.114 --> 00:49:04.855]  It's suicidal.
[00:49:04.855 --> 00:49:13.777]  However, persecution in the Quran, it says, is worse than slaughter.
[00:49:13.777 --> 00:49:16.437]  And you know, you talk about 1776,
[00:49:20.408 --> 00:49:22.931]  And you are so right.
[00:49:22.931 --> 00:49:28.238]  But in 1776, America had enough.
[00:49:28.238 --> 00:49:36.007]  The colonial people under Britain had enough.
[00:49:36.007 --> 00:49:39.351]  So when Patrick Henry said, give us liberty,
[00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:44.311]  Or we are willing to pay the price which is death.
[00:49:44.311 --> 00:49:58.356]  You force people into that when government fails to do its job to redress the grievance of the people who are suffering.
[00:49:58.356 --> 00:50:01.557]  Next Wednesday we premiere the full hour and a half interview.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:06.621]  Here at InfoWars during the four hour radio transmission.
[00:50:06.621 --> 00:50:11.643]  The full interview will be posted up to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:50:11.643 --> 00:50:14.804]  And notice how what Farrakhan was just saying ties in with Donald Trump saying.
[00:50:14.804 --> 00:50:17.825]  We have his video clip coming up after the break.
[00:50:17.825 --> 00:50:21.346]  Trump, Germans will riot, overthrow Merkel.
[00:50:22.793 --> 00:50:26.536]  And that story is a Curt Nemo article up on InfoWars.com.
[00:50:26.536 --> 00:50:28.577]  Needs to go viral.
[00:50:28.577 --> 00:50:33.201]  The Farrakhan interview is the top tile on InfoWars as well.
[00:50:33.201 --> 00:50:39.666]  It's just not refreshing in here for me for some reason, but now it's up there at InfoWars.com.
[00:50:39.666 --> 00:50:41.807]  So Trump, Germans will riot, overthrow Merkel.
[00:50:41.807 --> 00:50:43.829]  We have a little situation that could be a Trojan horse.
[00:50:44.289 --> 00:50:45.810]  Here they want to make it black against white.
[00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:51.554]  In Europe, they import radical Muslims to get a big fight going and then bring in martial law on the back of that.
[00:50:51.554 --> 00:50:53.255]  They already have, by the way.
[00:50:53.255 --> 00:50:54.616]  That's already come through.
[00:50:54.616 --> 00:50:57.678]  They've already... They call it chival emergency.
[00:50:57.678 --> 00:50:59.179]  And that's what's coming here.
[00:50:59.179 --> 00:50:59.560]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.734 --> 00:51:04.336]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?
[00:51:04.336 --> 00:51:06.697]  How would you like to never be cold again?
[00:51:06.697 --> 00:51:13.580]  This is Dale with Fortress Clothing, and I'm here to tell you, you will never be cold again with Fortress.

[00:52:25.233 --> 00:52:27.575]  My name is Jonathan Wright, and I'm 40 years old.
[00:52:27.575 --> 00:52:30.418]  I recently went from a desk job to a manual labor job.
[00:52:30.418 --> 00:52:31.539]  Normally, I'm worn out.
[00:52:31.539 --> 00:52:37.344]  With Energy Enhanced One World Way, I now recover so quickly that I can perform very hard work all day long.
[00:52:37.344 --> 00:52:42.709]  I use Energy Enhanced One World Way for breakfast and lunch, and I experience less hunger throughout the day.
[00:52:42.709 --> 00:52:45.812]  I have a 30% increase in energy, and I just feel better.
[00:52:45.812 --> 00:52:49.115]  I plan to make Energy Enhanced One World Way a permanent part of my lifestyle.

[00:52:59.899 --> 00:53:04.140]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:04.760]  It's true.
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:08.902]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:53:08.902 --> 00:53:11.302]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.

[00:54:24.754 --> 00:54:27.297]  Livin' on the road, my friend
[00:54:35.018 --> 00:54:44.920]  I'll tell you, going and meeting with Louis Farrakhan and trying to work with one of the biggest black leaders in the world.
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:49.221]  He's up there in the top two or three.
[00:54:49.221 --> 00:54:52.382]  He's well known and respected in Africa and many other places.
[00:54:52.382 --> 00:54:55.383]  He goes and speaks to crowds of hundreds of thousands in places like Nigeria.
[00:54:58.274 --> 00:55:06.878]  And he's speaking out about nationalism there and against tribalism to bring people together to make their country strong so the IMF and World Bank can't rob them.
[00:55:06.878 --> 00:55:08.399]  I want Africa to do well.
[00:55:08.399 --> 00:55:10.059]  I have goodwill.
[00:55:10.059 --> 00:55:20.724]  Does that mean I don't like big groups of racist black people out there that have a chip on their shoulder and think I hate them because the Democratic Party taught them that?
[00:55:20.724 --> 00:55:23.326]  No, I don't like it.
[00:55:23.326 --> 00:55:24.066]  But I'm not an idiot.
[00:55:25.677 --> 00:55:27.258]  And I'm not a tribalist.
[00:55:27.258 --> 00:55:28.559]  And Farrakhan agreed with this.
[00:55:28.559 --> 00:55:32.061]  He said, you have to defend your own group.
[00:55:32.061 --> 00:55:40.247]  You have to stand up for yourselves, but at the same time, groups have to start talking to each other and not being played against one another.
[00:55:40.247 --> 00:55:44.649]  And so, that is some major diplomacy.
[00:55:44.649 --> 00:55:47.551]  That's a big deal.
[00:55:47.551 --> 00:55:50.033]  And I assure you, the establishment doesn't want that to happen.
[00:55:52.372 --> 00:56:03.035]  Now in the case of the Muslims being brought in who are Sunnis, radical Wahhabists, they can't even get along with other Sunnis or Shiite or Christians, they kill everybody.
[00:56:03.035 --> 00:56:10.217]  And that's who almost every, I mean for every couple hundred Sunni Wahhabists they bring in, there might be a Shiite or Christian.
[00:56:10.217 --> 00:56:13.018]  There have been countless articles on that.
[00:56:13.018 --> 00:56:17.680]  They'll bring in 249 radical Muslims and they'll bring in one Christian.
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:18.440]  I mean those are the numbers.
[00:56:19.841 --> 00:56:26.392]  Different reports, they'll bring in 160 something, a thousand something, they'll only bring in a couple Christians.
[00:56:26.392 --> 00:56:27.294]  The numbers are insane.
[00:56:30.495 --> 00:56:33.276]  Because they know there's no compatibility with that.
[00:56:33.276 --> 00:56:36.938]  You talk about, not even so much racist, but tribal.
[00:56:36.938 --> 00:56:40.740]  Those Muslims come in and they say, I don't want to be around Germans, I don't want to be around anybody else.
[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:42.821]  We need to kick the Jews out of this country.
[00:56:42.821 --> 00:56:44.422]  And the liberals are all, yay, yay, yay.
[00:56:44.422 --> 00:56:49.145]  And I notice the left really getting into anti-Semitism the last ten years, which is just a red herring.
[00:56:49.145 --> 00:56:51.446]  The average Jew isn't running around doing anything wrong.
[00:56:51.446 --> 00:56:55.368]  That's more than a Mexican running around, or a German, or a whatever.
[00:56:56.493 --> 00:56:59.595]  Are there some big organized crime syndicates headed up by Jews?
[00:56:59.595 --> 00:57:00.396]  Absolutely.
[00:57:00.396 --> 00:57:01.677]  Goldman Sachs?
[00:57:01.677 --> 00:57:06.721]  Is there a Jewish mafia that set up the ADL on record in what, 1913?
[00:57:06.721 --> 00:57:07.802]  Absolutely.
[00:57:07.802 --> 00:57:09.023]  Am I against those mafias?
[00:57:09.023 --> 00:57:09.864]  Absolutely.
[00:57:09.864 --> 00:57:13.747]  But then when they get attacked, they make it all about the Jewish community as a whole.
[00:57:13.747 --> 00:57:16.609]  This is how they fool folks, the globalists.
[00:57:16.609 --> 00:57:18.210]  The same globalists that funded Hitler.
[00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:20.032]  This is not a Jewish conspiracy.
[00:57:20.032 --> 00:57:24.816]  But regardless of what's behind the conspiracy, can we all agree to be against world government?
[00:57:25.575 --> 00:57:26.777]  Against race war.
[00:57:26.777 --> 00:57:28.600]  Against Trojan horse.
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:34.409]  And to be against it, you've got to stop them bringing the Trojan horse in, and that's the radical Muslims kicked out of Syria.
[00:57:34.409 --> 00:57:38.075]  Let's go to the clip of Donald Trump saying Germans will riot, overthrow Merkel.
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:39.680]  In Cologne.
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:40.881]  Cologne never had a problem.
[00:57:40.881 --> 00:57:42.201]  Cologne, Germany.
[00:57:42.201 --> 00:57:43.241]  Okay?
[00:57:43.241 --> 00:57:44.322]  Everything's fine.
[00:57:44.322 --> 00:57:45.602]  Everything's nice.
[00:57:45.602 --> 00:57:46.082]  Clean.
[00:57:46.082 --> 00:57:46.582]  Beautiful.
[00:57:46.582 --> 00:57:47.682]  No problem.
[00:57:47.682 --> 00:57:49.103]  Now they're having riots.
[00:57:49.103 --> 00:57:50.023]  They're having rapes.
[00:57:50.023 --> 00:57:53.184]  They're having... They never... The New Year's Eve has... Have you heard about the New Year's Eve?
[00:57:53.184 --> 00:57:54.985]  It was like a disaster.
[00:57:54.985 --> 00:57:56.445]  And the German people are gonna riot.
[00:57:56.445 --> 00:57:58.686]  The German people are gonna end up overthrowing this woman.
[00:57:58.686 --> 00:58:00.766]  I don't know what the hell she's thinking.
[00:58:00.766 --> 00:58:04.187]  But they have millions of people pouring into Germany and now they're not stopping them.
[00:58:04.187 --> 00:58:07.048]  Now I guess they're gonna have to stop because the German people aren't gonna put up
[00:58:08.837 --> 00:58:11.618]  So there you go.
[00:58:11.618 --> 00:58:17.979]  And Trump, remember three or four months ago, said, oh, Al-Qaeda's killing these poor refugees, we gotta bring them in.
[00:58:17.979 --> 00:58:26.161]  Then he got educated real quick and he said, I was wrong, I didn't know they were actually the Al-Qaeda people themselves, we've been lied to, stop them all, and then he's the biggest racist on the planet.
[00:58:26.161 --> 00:58:26.801]  See how that works?
[00:58:26.801 --> 00:58:30.362]  I mean, Trump really listens to people.
[00:58:30.362 --> 00:58:31.702]  Trump really listens to his advisor.
[00:58:32.788 --> 00:58:36.050]  Trump was told in a day that we were critical of that.
[00:58:36.050 --> 00:58:37.411]  And that you were critical of it.
[00:58:37.411 --> 00:58:39.833]  I mean, he's really responsive, folks.
[00:58:39.833 --> 00:58:41.655]  I mean, they call it radical.
[00:58:41.655 --> 00:58:43.596]  What he said is common sense.
[00:58:43.596 --> 00:58:44.216]  Stay with us.
[00:58:44.216 --> 00:58:44.717]  Second hour.
[00:58:44.717 --> 00:58:45.698]  It's right ahead.
[00:58:50.228 --> 00:58:53.729]  Infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.
[00:58:53.729 --> 00:58:59.311]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:58:59.311 --> 00:59:07.673]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[00:59:07.673 --> 00:59:13.335]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[00:59:13.815 --> 00:59:22.900]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy-to-use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:29.123]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:59:29.123 --> 00:59:35.886]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:59:35.886 --> 00:59:40.929]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[00:59:41.229 --> 00:59:43.710]  Now available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:52.592]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:59:52.592 --> 01:00:01.815]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:01.815 --> 01:00:04.576]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:00:04.576 --> 01:00:07.357]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:13.757 --> 01:00:27.883]  Larry Nichols, who was a top Clinton insider, and he blew the whistle on everything from Whitewater to you name it, has got huge intel straight ahead of what Obama's master plan is.
[01:00:27.883 --> 01:00:29.123]  Oh, Biden.
[01:00:29.123 --> 01:00:30.984]  Oh, Biden.
[01:00:30.984 --> 01:00:34.726]  Which is the continuation of Obama.
[01:00:34.726 --> 01:00:38.707]  The fact that Biden is a ghost candidate for Osama.
[01:00:38.707 --> 01:00:41.649]  I mean, Obama, that was not a Freudian slip, another attempt at lame humor.
[01:00:42.588 --> 01:00:47.873]  You gotta have some gallows humor with the stuff going on because it is crazy.
[01:00:47.873 --> 01:00:49.855]  And then of course we'll also look at the global economy.
[01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:57.902]  I shot a video this morning when I thought I was going to be late to work because of a big story I was working on.
[01:00:57.902 --> 01:01:04.688]  And I basically spoke about this pretty eloquently.
[01:01:04.688 --> 01:01:07.191]  It's titled, Top Bank, The Collapse Has Begun.
[01:01:11.324 --> 01:01:27.274]  And in it, I point out that the trolls are all over YouTube, all over InfoWars, saying that the Royal Bank of Scotland, very important central bank, and a bunch of others are coming out, saying a global collapse is beginning.
[01:01:27.274 --> 01:01:30.676]  And that sell everything, it's going to be as bad as the Great Depression of the 20s.
[01:01:30.676 --> 01:01:35.659]  Just what our guest, Dent, said last week.
[01:01:35.659 --> 01:01:37.160]  Just what our other guests are saying.
[01:01:38.442 --> 01:01:40.244]  Now, I'm not saying this is imminent.
[01:01:40.244 --> 01:01:54.536]  This is what the experts are saying, and all I know is what we have is untenable, but they just love the fact that, I mean, they play this game like Obama's saying, our veterans are doing great, I fixed the VA, it's worse than ever, our economy's wonderful, anybody that says it isn't is a liar.
[01:01:54.536 --> 01:01:57.018]  These are quotes from the State of the Union last night.
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:13.488]  And then I realized they're targeting people that aren't awake yet and that there's the appeal to authority to have the president just saying that the sky isn't blue at high noon in Colorado.
[01:02:13.488 --> 01:02:15.629]  I mean, it is.
[01:02:15.629 --> 01:02:16.489]  But there's the video.
[01:02:16.489 --> 01:02:18.691]  Top Bank, the collapse has begun.
[01:02:18.691 --> 01:02:22.753]  And it's a good breakdown that I engage in.
[01:02:22.753 --> 01:02:27.876]  And I'm going to cover it more coming up, but just type in cataclysmic year
[01:02:29.617 --> 01:02:30.938]  Repeat of the Great Depression.
[01:02:30.938 --> 01:02:32.519]  Type this into Google News.
[01:02:32.519 --> 01:02:34.079]  Great Depression.
[01:02:34.079 --> 01:02:35.480]  Repeat of Great Depression.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:36.841]  Cataclysmic year.
[01:02:36.841 --> 01:02:38.622]  Sell everything.
[01:02:38.622 --> 01:02:42.844]  And you'll see a bunch of top analysts and heads of central banks and people saying it.
[01:02:42.844 --> 01:02:43.865]  But, I mean, here's the CNN.
[01:02:45.458 --> 01:02:48.219]  And again, I'm not saying this to the bot trolls.
[01:02:48.219 --> 01:02:50.400]  They're bot and they're bots.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.261]  They've been paid for and they're bots.
[01:02:52.261 --> 01:02:53.801]  But humans load the bots.
[01:02:53.801 --> 01:02:54.581]  We can track it.
[01:02:54.581 --> 01:02:57.162]  In fact, I keep telling my crew I want to do another report on this.
[01:02:57.162 --> 01:03:09.127]  I've done one in years where we show the IP addresses and show how they have fake debates with each other and say racist stuff about black people, racist stuff about white people, and then, you know, the standard ju-ju-ju-ju-la-la, you know, just do that.
[01:03:09.747 --> 01:03:13.648]  And I think it's really informative, though, once we understand what they're doing.
[01:03:13.648 --> 01:03:18.370]  This is government and corporate bots that are doing this.
[01:03:18.370 --> 01:03:22.211]  I mean, they call them sock puppets, they call them bullhorns.
[01:03:22.211 --> 01:03:28.173]  That's the different government handle terms they use for this, but we need to be aware of this.
[01:03:28.173 --> 01:03:31.614]  And those same bots are running around saying, kill the police.
[01:03:31.614 --> 01:03:32.694]  The police are our enemy.
[01:03:34.332 --> 01:03:36.733]  And there is a big problem with some of the police in this country.
[01:03:36.733 --> 01:03:38.254]  There's a problem with America.
[01:03:38.254 --> 01:03:40.095]  There's a problem with government corruption.
[01:03:40.095 --> 01:03:45.258]  But the police are the lowest level of this and not where you reform it.
[01:03:45.258 --> 01:03:46.639]  You reform it at the top.
[01:03:46.639 --> 01:03:48.360]  You go after who's doing the training.
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:50.841]  You go after the problem.
[01:03:50.841 --> 01:04:04.248]  You don't sit there and try to start a bloody civil war that makes the civil war be illegitimate and makes the revolution illegitimate and violent when we're having a cultural libertarian renaissance revolution against their whole Maoist system.
[01:04:06.072 --> 01:04:08.152]  So I hammer, look out for false flags.
[01:04:08.152 --> 01:04:11.793]  Don't join the system in just saying kill police.
[01:04:11.793 --> 01:04:16.114]  Admit there's a jihad going on that the globalists have opened the doors for to bring in martial law.
[01:04:16.114 --> 01:04:18.015]  Admit they're bankrupting us by design.
[01:04:18.015 --> 01:04:34.859]  And admit who's behind it so as the collapse unfolds, the New World Order gets the blame and doesn't get a giant power grab out of it of trillions more in banker bailouts and regulatory power to shut down their competition and to take over society.
[01:04:34.859 --> 01:04:35.399]  Here's CNN.
[01:04:37.335 --> 01:04:40.578]  Hey, you can just type this in and you'll get hundreds of newspapers.
[01:04:40.578 --> 01:04:41.378]  Sell everything.
[01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:43.980]  2016 will be a cataclysmic year.
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:47.083]  Warren's the Royal Bank of Scotland hit.
[01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:51.306]  And again, they put out this meme that Alex Jones is Brian Williams of Fear Porn.
[01:04:51.306 --> 01:04:52.707]  Nothing's happening.
[01:04:52.707 --> 01:04:54.088]  Nothing's happening?!
[01:04:54.088 --> 01:04:56.450]  We're on the verge of World War III with the Russians.
[01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:57.811]  All hell's breaking loose!
[01:05:00.442 --> 01:05:07.367]  Obama is removing obstacles for driverless cars, pushing back against state regulation, clearing the road for Google.
[01:05:07.367 --> 01:05:18.335]  After Google cars were involved in 11 accidents in six years, the California DMV proposed new state regulations to require a human, a steering wheel, throttle and brake pedals on California roads.
[01:05:18.835 --> 01:05:20.216]  Can't have that, Obama says.
[01:05:20.216 --> 01:05:23.259]  Can't have a patchwork of state regulations for robot cars.
[01:05:23.259 --> 01:05:29.164]  Google Car's accident rate would work out to 83 accidents over 45 years of driving.
[01:05:29.164 --> 01:05:33.048]  How many humans do you know that have had 83 accidents?
[01:05:33.048 --> 01:05:34.789]  Would you get in their car?
[01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:35.650]  But don't worry.
[01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:37.351]  Obama's just offering you a choice.
[01:05:37.351 --> 01:05:42.336]  Your own personal limo where you can just play on social media and leave the driving to them.
[01:05:42.336 --> 01:05:44.438]  Like Obamacare, with Obama Car,
[01:05:44.838 --> 01:05:47.661]  If you like your car, you can keep your car.
[01:05:47.661 --> 01:05:50.925]  You just won't be able to afford the insurance to drive your own car.
[01:05:50.925 --> 01:05:53.488]  Because, you know, Obama cars are safer than you.
[01:05:53.488 --> 01:05:54.849]  Right.
[01:05:54.849 --> 01:05:55.850]  83 accidents.
[01:05:55.850 --> 01:05:56.932]  Not my fault.

[01:07:48.550 --> 01:07:53.293]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:53.293 --> 01:07:55.174]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:24.384 --> 01:08:25.184]  In Cologne.
[01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:26.384]  Cologne never had a problem.
[01:08:26.384 --> 01:08:27.685]  Cologne, Germany.
[01:08:27.685 --> 01:08:28.725]  Okay?
[01:08:28.725 --> 01:08:29.805]  Everything's fine.
[01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:31.105]  Everything's nice.
[01:08:31.105 --> 01:08:31.585]  Clean.
[01:08:31.585 --> 01:08:32.125]  Beautiful.
[01:08:32.125 --> 01:08:33.166]  No problem.
[01:08:33.166 --> 01:08:34.586]  Now they're having riots.
[01:08:34.586 --> 01:08:35.506]  They're having rapes.
[01:08:35.506 --> 01:08:38.667]  They're having... They never... The New Year's Eve has... Have you heard about the New Year's Eve?
[01:08:38.667 --> 01:08:40.467]  It was like a disaster.
[01:08:40.467 --> 01:08:41.947]  And the German people are gonna riot.
[01:08:41.947 --> 01:08:44.167]  The German people are gonna end up overthrowing this woman.
[01:08:44.167 --> 01:08:46.248]  I don't know what the hell she's thinking.
[01:08:46.248 --> 01:08:49.688]  But they have millions of people pouring into Germany and now they're not stopping them.
[01:08:49.688 --> 01:08:52.529]  Now I guess they're gonna have to stop because the German people aren't gonna put up.
[01:08:54.133 --> 01:08:56.935]  And now the EU announced they expect 10 million in 2016.
[01:08:56.935 --> 01:09:00.997]  They've already brought a couple million into Germany.
[01:09:00.997 --> 01:09:12.783]  You are seeing the actual invasion like it's Lord of the Rings and Mordor is inside Minas Tirith and has opened the gates and is letting the orcs in.
[01:09:13.908 --> 01:09:24.819]  Right in front of us, Merkel and Obama have opened the gate, and people are just running around with guns and bombs, machine gunning, blowing up, attacking police stations, attacking theaters.
[01:09:24.819 --> 01:09:27.381]  They won't even call it Islamic terrorism.
[01:09:27.381 --> 01:09:28.722]  Cops are getting shot in the head.
[01:09:28.722 --> 01:09:32.006]  Al-Akbar, Al-Akbar in Philadelphia.
[01:09:32.006 --> 01:09:33.287]  Media won't say it's Islamic.
[01:09:34.554 --> 01:09:39.096]  Because they want to cause civil disobedience and bring in martial law.
[01:09:39.096 --> 01:09:40.576]  Europe's already done it.
[01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:47.599]  Merkel had the police say no demonstrations against the open borders, and they attacked with tear gas two days ago Germans in Cologne.
[01:09:47.599 --> 01:09:51.940]  They didn't attack the thousands of radical Muslims running around raping.
[01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:54.041]  Think of the magnitude of that.
[01:09:55.276 --> 01:10:00.498]  You know, if you listened to me 10 years ago, I was all against invading the Middle East 15 years ago.
[01:10:00.498 --> 01:10:18.585]  I mean, I don't want a clash of civilizations, but once it's on, once they brought in the most radical usurpers of the Middle East, Wahhabi and Sunnis, and then given them Stinger missiles, which they now admit they gave them, Hillary and Clinton,
[01:10:21.084 --> 01:10:25.969]  Hillary and Bill and Obama and Donald Trump comes out and says they created ISIS, which is true.
[01:10:25.969 --> 01:10:33.457]  You heard it here with Colonel Schaeffer and others four years ago on the whole ISIS-Al Qaeda situation before they called it ISIS.
[01:10:33.457 --> 01:10:37.141]  What are they going to do because Trump just keeps telling the truth and it doesn't work?
[01:10:37.141 --> 01:10:38.743]  Are they going to try to assassinate him?
[01:10:38.743 --> 01:10:40.044]  What dirty tricks are they going to run?
[01:10:41.277 --> 01:11:02.979]  What is Obama's plan financing the Muslim Brotherhood, again Wahhabist Sunnis, to overthrow Egypt, to overthrow Libya, to turn it over to Al Qaeda, ISIS spreading to Afghanistan, ISIS spreading to Libya, ISIS taking over Libya, the Defense Department says this week, and then Obama comes out in the State of the Union and says, we're beating ISIS, they've been defeated, and the economy's great, and then Joe Biden
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:12.827]  He's circling around in the background, according to our guest, and now that's coming out, he said this six months ago, as the shadow candidate ready to slide in.
[01:11:12.827 --> 01:11:26.838]  Larry Nichols, the former top Clinton insider, the guy that helped release the info that became the Clinton Chronicles, the guy that Bill Clinton's told the New York Times he's the most worried about in this campaign, is here with his expertise.
[01:11:26.838 --> 01:11:30.721]  He used to run their campaigns to tell you the dirty tricks they're planning to run.
[01:11:30.721 --> 01:11:31.962]  What does it mean when Soros
[01:11:32.742 --> 01:11:34.523]  And MoveOn says they're endorsing Sanders.
[01:11:34.523 --> 01:11:41.848]  What does it mean when the Washington Post comes out last week and reports on Clinton's bimbos that were raped, not just the eruptions?
[01:11:41.848 --> 01:11:43.650]  Are we about to see the fall of Hillary?
[01:11:45.165 --> 01:11:52.309]  Well, if one guy out there knows, because I don't think anybody completely knows, it's fluid in my opinion, it's Larry Nichols.
[01:11:52.309 --> 01:11:54.871]  And Larry, I hope you had a good Christmas and things.
[01:11:54.871 --> 01:11:56.131]  I hope you're feeling better.
[01:11:56.131 --> 01:11:58.853]  I know you've been quite ill with cancer, but God bless you for your courage.
[01:11:58.853 --> 01:12:02.475]  You joined us via video Skype today on this Wednesday edition.
[01:12:02.475 --> 01:12:04.936]  You heard my little setup there.
[01:12:04.936 --> 01:12:06.617]  What sayeth you?
[01:12:06.617 --> 01:12:09.659]  Oh, it's coming just like I was afraid it would.
[01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:11.140]  You gotta watch old Biden.
[01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:13.622]  Remember when I told you that?
[01:12:13.622 --> 01:12:14.382]  There's a problem.
[01:12:15.137 --> 01:12:20.501]  Obama wants to either cash in... I'm sorry about that, there's somebody out back.
[01:12:20.501 --> 01:12:30.068]  Obama wants to either cash in the FEMA provisional government, but if not that, then he wants to become Secretary General of the UN.
[01:12:30.068 --> 01:12:36.472]  Now for him to be Secretary General of the UN, he's got to do a couple of moves.
[01:12:36.472 --> 01:12:44.098]  Number one, gotta get rid of Hillary, because if she gets elected, Bill will be Secretary General to the UN, not Obama.
[01:12:44.098 --> 01:12:44.438]  And then,
[01:12:45.623 --> 01:12:51.686]  He's got to get Vice President Biden.
[01:12:51.686 --> 01:12:53.307]  He's got to be the candidate.
[01:12:53.307 --> 01:12:56.028]  Now, he's been a ghost candidate all along.
[01:12:56.028 --> 01:12:58.049]  Alex, we used to do this all the time.
[01:12:58.049 --> 01:12:59.630]  Why would he get in?
[01:12:59.630 --> 01:13:01.311]  Alex, why would he get in the race now?
[01:13:01.311 --> 01:13:04.112]  Because every day he's in, he gets whacked at.
[01:13:04.112 --> 01:13:06.093]  All he's got to do is just sit tight.
[01:13:06.093 --> 01:13:11.495]  He can come in fresh with high approval ratings and trample Hillary if he needs to or Bernie Sanders or whoever.
[01:13:11.495 --> 01:13:12.556]  Well, they'll get rid of Hillary.
[01:13:13.562 --> 01:13:23.306]  All they've got to do, in case people want to know, all they've got to do is have the FBI or Lynch indict Hillary on a felony criminal charge.
[01:13:23.306 --> 01:13:25.707]  And then she has to suspend her candidates.
[01:13:25.707 --> 01:13:28.689]  And notice she just got caught again lying about the emails.
[01:13:28.689 --> 01:13:30.610]  She said there were no more classified.
[01:13:30.610 --> 01:13:31.750]  She's red-handed.
[01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:34.391]  Could easily be sent to the federal pen.
[01:13:34.391 --> 01:13:35.432]  Right.
[01:13:35.432 --> 01:13:36.092]  That's right.
[01:13:36.092 --> 01:13:42.695]  And when she suspends her candidate, you know who picks who's going to be the presidential candidate for the Democratic Party?
[01:13:44.244 --> 01:13:47.205]  It'll be the Dem DNC Executive Committee.
[01:13:47.205 --> 01:13:56.228]  Now, who do you think, if you're sitting there without Hillary, you got Bernie Sanders or you got Joe Biden?
[01:13:56.228 --> 01:13:57.329]  It's Joe Biden all the way.
[01:13:57.329 --> 01:13:59.209]  They're going to put Biden in.
[01:13:59.209 --> 01:14:05.651]  Now, that's the plan B. Plan A is to do just what he's been trying to do.
[01:14:05.651 --> 01:14:12.994]  And this is why I've always said to you, Alex, our best friend right now, crazy as it seems, is Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[01:14:13.925 --> 01:14:15.749]  You know, we've got two choices.
[01:14:15.749 --> 01:14:17.753]  If it's Hillary, we got communism.
[01:14:17.753 --> 01:14:21.441]  If it's Obama, we got Islam.
[01:14:21.441 --> 01:14:23.746]  And at this point, the best thing to do...
[01:14:24.597 --> 01:14:29.460]  Just make sure, make sure Obama doesn't get to stay.
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:34.124]  Now just six months ago you brought up these scenarios but said you wanted to bring Hillary down.
[01:14:34.124 --> 01:14:40.568]  I'll be honest, I think America's been poisoned by communism, doesn't recognize it, and that's what's harder to beat.
[01:14:40.568 --> 01:14:45.772]  I think radical Islam we can actually beat, even if we have a jihad president in power.
[01:14:45.772 --> 01:14:47.173]  I don't know if I agree with you on this.
[01:14:47.173 --> 01:14:52.656]  I think radical Islam is easier to beat if we put the clamps down on it right now.
[01:14:52.656 --> 01:14:53.457]  Well, it may be.
[01:14:54.495 --> 01:14:55.316]  It may be.
[01:14:55.316 --> 01:14:58.918]  I just, all I can do is read the tea leaves as I see them.
[01:14:58.918 --> 01:15:02.540]  And I watch what Obama has the power to do with this country.
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:05.883]  I mean, he could literally take the Republicans, spin them on a hat.
[01:15:05.883 --> 01:15:10.766]  Did you see CNN and other Democratic groups are now calling for him to declare a civil emergency and just take the guns?
[01:15:10.766 --> 01:15:13.668]  I mean, when CNN's doing it, boy, you know you're in trouble.
[01:15:14.469 --> 01:15:17.630]  And then you know what happens when he declares a civil emergency, right?
[01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:20.011]  You've said it every time you've been on for the last year.
[01:15:20.011 --> 01:15:25.433]  Of course, you were on 20 years ago as well and 15 years ago, but you said, watch talk a civil emergency.
[01:15:25.433 --> 01:15:27.093]  Watch talk a civil emergency.
[01:15:27.093 --> 01:15:29.614]  And they're actually starting to trial balloon it right now.
[01:15:29.614 --> 01:15:31.074]  That's exactly right.
[01:15:31.074 --> 01:15:35.596]  You know, Alex, we're in more trouble now than we've ever been in.
[01:15:35.596 --> 01:15:36.456]  Everybody can feel it.
[01:15:36.456 --> 01:15:37.536]  That's the good news, though.
[01:15:37.536 --> 01:15:40.197]  Everybody I talk to is waking up.
[01:15:40.197 --> 01:15:42.738]  The thing that the people have got to do
[01:15:43.678 --> 01:15:44.939]  It starts spreading the word.
[01:15:44.939 --> 01:15:46.139]  This is serious.
[01:15:46.139 --> 01:15:49.501]  This is not a Larry Nichols and Alex Jones talk.
[01:15:49.501 --> 01:15:50.281]  This is serious.
[01:15:50.281 --> 01:15:51.742]  This is the real deal.
[01:15:51.742 --> 01:15:54.584]  They're making moves every day.
[01:15:54.584 --> 01:15:56.925]  Every day to just take us down.
[01:15:56.925 --> 01:15:58.225]  To take our country down.
[01:15:58.225 --> 01:16:06.550]  Of course, they're not going to say we're taking the country down because you've got people like CNN that make it look like it's the thing to do, the right thing to do.
[01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:08.871]  But now it's up to Hillary.
[01:16:08.871 --> 01:16:10.912]  This game that we're in right now,
[01:16:11.687 --> 01:16:13.488]  Is the battle of the big boys.
[01:16:13.488 --> 01:16:15.628]  The Clintons versus Obama.
[01:16:15.628 --> 01:16:17.089]  It's not going to be pretty.
[01:16:17.089 --> 01:16:18.609]  It's not going to be pretty at all.
[01:16:18.609 --> 01:16:20.850]  But it's down to those two.
[01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:22.630]  Well, it's happening, basically, like you said.
[01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:25.591]  And then, of course, now they pretty much admit this in the news.
[01:16:25.591 --> 01:16:28.292]  I mean, Biden, obviously, I think is a better candidate than Hillary.
[01:16:28.292 --> 01:16:29.912]  She looks like something's wrong with her.
[01:16:29.912 --> 01:16:31.032]  You know Hillary well.
[01:16:31.032 --> 01:16:32.233]  Does she not look ill to you?
[01:16:32.233 --> 01:16:36.854]  And she disappears for weeks on end?
[01:16:36.854 --> 01:16:37.814]  She's looking bad.
[01:16:37.814 --> 01:16:40.155]  Now, I don't know if it's from her.
[01:16:41.107 --> 01:16:42.728]  Being ill.
[01:16:42.728 --> 01:16:45.449]  But remember, Hillary's not Bill Clinton.
[01:16:45.449 --> 01:16:46.350]  She's not smooth.
[01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:48.491]  She's not slick.
[01:16:48.491 --> 01:16:54.954]  And Hillary, I assure you, cannot take Alex getting beat up.
[01:16:54.954 --> 01:16:55.455]  She can't.
[01:16:55.455 --> 01:16:59.617]  Oh no, she goes around having her thugs threaten major comedy clubs that make jokes about her.
[01:17:00.185 --> 01:17:00.865]  Yeah.
[01:17:00.865 --> 01:17:06.787]  I mean, you gotta understand with Hillary, that sets her on fire.
[01:17:06.787 --> 01:17:11.408]  And I believe she's sitting there just so mad she wants to tear people's heads off.
[01:17:11.408 --> 01:17:14.448]  And if it's up to her, she will tear people's heads off.
[01:17:14.448 --> 01:17:14.809]  Well, sure.
[01:17:14.809 --> 01:17:19.450]  I mean, an aggressive, confident man thinks it's a joke when he's being attacked and lied about because he knows truth all out.
[01:17:19.450 --> 01:17:24.271]  It is statistically, I've noticed, true that it's women in power that really flip out to criticism.
[01:17:24.271 --> 01:17:25.111]  Oh, you bet.
[01:17:25.111 --> 01:17:25.451]  You bet.
[01:17:25.451 --> 01:17:26.851]  Well, she's the worst.
[01:17:26.851 --> 01:17:28.392]  She is the worst.
[01:17:28.392 --> 01:17:28.812]  But Alex,
[01:17:29.634 --> 01:17:32.955]  Watch what's going on.
[01:17:32.955 --> 01:17:37.897]  Last night in the whatever you want to call that thing Obama did, watch what he said about Biden.
[01:17:37.897 --> 01:17:39.637]  He said Biden's going to cure cancer.
[01:17:39.637 --> 01:17:41.758]  You could tell he was setting him up.
[01:17:41.758 --> 01:17:46.320]  He was setting him up to be the answer to the problems of the world.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:47.400]  He's basically like God.
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.140]  He's like Jesus.
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:50.281]  He waves a wand.
[01:17:50.281 --> 01:17:51.862]  That's exactly what he was doing.
[01:17:51.862 --> 01:17:53.882]  So you can see it coming, Alex.
[01:17:53.882 --> 01:17:55.063]  You can see it coming.
[01:17:55.063 --> 01:17:56.143]  You can feel it coming.
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:58.881]  But they got one problem this time.
[01:17:58.881 --> 01:18:01.542]  You remember when we fought them before.
[01:18:01.542 --> 01:18:05.123]  It was me, you, and a handful of other people.
[01:18:05.123 --> 01:18:07.364]  Handful of other programs.
[01:18:07.364 --> 01:18:13.607]  This time the people are picking up on- I agree, back then it was the Western Journalism Center, you, Drudge.
[01:18:13.607 --> 01:18:15.067]  Really, it was Newsmax.
[01:18:15.067 --> 01:18:16.608]  I mean, there was nobody.
[01:18:16.608 --> 01:18:17.388]  There was nobody.
[01:18:17.388 --> 01:18:21.470]  This time, you gotta realize the power you have, Alex, this time.
[01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:24.331]  Now, with that power, unfortunately, buddy, comes responsibility.
[01:18:25.593 --> 01:18:31.279]  You are drawing larger audiences when all the other media formats are losing audience.
[01:18:32.358 --> 01:18:38.301]  And then people are starting, I hear it every day Alex, I hear people every day say, I'm turning off my television.
[01:18:38.301 --> 01:18:41.043]  One lady said she threw hers out to the garbage.
[01:18:41.043 --> 01:18:42.423]  She's watching nothing but Apple Law.
[01:18:42.423 --> 01:18:48.667]  We're having affiliates call us and they want me to lead a national plan to have stations dump national news and do their own local.
[01:18:48.667 --> 01:18:49.587]  That's right.
[01:18:49.587 --> 01:18:51.028]  Well, it's out there.
[01:18:51.028 --> 01:18:51.769]  It's out there.
[01:18:51.769 --> 01:18:55.591]  And I get calls every day from people that are saying, what can we do?
[01:18:55.591 --> 01:18:56.211]  What can we do?
[01:18:57.381 --> 01:18:59.542]  And what we do is we spread the word.
[01:18:59.542 --> 01:19:04.104]  We've got, Alex, I say we, and I say that loosely.
[01:19:04.104 --> 01:19:05.744]  The Liberty Movement.
[01:19:05.744 --> 01:19:07.145]  No, no, the Liberty Movement.
[01:19:07.145 --> 01:19:08.505]  Well, the Liberty Movement, then.
[01:19:08.505 --> 01:19:11.106]  Somebody's got to grow an army.
[01:19:11.106 --> 01:19:18.989]  An army of people that are disciplined, trained, know exactly what to do to defeat these people, because it's coming.
[01:19:18.989 --> 01:19:20.210]  It's coming down.
[01:19:20.210 --> 01:19:22.931]  Well, you're the former Army Green Beret.
[01:19:22.931 --> 01:19:23.711]  Tell us how to do it.
[01:19:23.711 --> 01:19:24.772]  All I'm doing is an info war.
[01:19:27.014 --> 01:19:32.577]  It's, uh, the first thing you do is you look and gather your in situ army.
[01:19:32.577 --> 01:19:33.798]  That's what you always have to do.
[01:19:33.798 --> 01:19:38.221]  You have to look around, you have to acknowledge, you have to know who you've got.
[01:19:38.221 --> 01:19:39.221]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:19:39.221 --> 01:19:40.582]  Come back and tell us, Larry.
[01:19:40.582 --> 01:19:41.022]  Stay there.
[01:19:41.022 --> 01:19:41.623]  Come back.
[01:19:41.623 --> 01:19:42.663]  He's absolutely right.
[01:19:42.663 --> 01:19:44.144]  You are the army, folks.
[01:19:44.144 --> 01:19:46.886]  We're just here exposing the intel of what's happening.
[01:19:46.886 --> 01:19:47.646]  You're giving us intel, too.
[01:19:47.646 --> 01:19:50.408]  You're going to have to decide what you're going to do, folks, in the info war.
[01:19:50.408 --> 01:19:52.189]  We're going to hear from Larry Nichols straight ahead.
[01:19:55.914 --> 01:19:58.202]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:20:00.307 --> 01:20:03.548]  Why be held hostage by your wireless carrier for two years?
[01:20:03.548 --> 01:20:10.429]  What if you had no contract, no activation fees, no hidden costs, tracking, tracing, harvesting customer data, or draconian gimmicks?
[01:20:10.429 --> 01:20:13.049]  All on the nation's best 4G LTE network.

[01:20:30.072 --> 01:20:30.992]  Shower Filters.
[01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:32.713]  We're introducing the best yet.
[01:20:32.713 --> 01:20:36.795]  The brand new ProPure ProMax High Performance Shower Filter.
[01:20:36.795 --> 01:20:41.597]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[01:20:41.597 --> 01:20:48.680]  This new 4-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:55.642]  You can find more details on this amazing new filter and free shipping at InfowarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139 to order your ProMax Shower Filter from ProPure today.
[01:21:00.168 --> 01:21:02.897]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[01:21:02.897 --> 01:21:06.388]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:11.081]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[01:21:11.081 --> 01:21:16.523]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[01:21:16.523 --> 01:21:18.004]  How is this even possible?
[01:21:18.004 --> 01:21:25.546]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[01:21:25.546 --> 01:21:33.189]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:36.410]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[01:21:36.690 --> 01:21:44.498]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[01:21:44.498 --> 01:21:47.661]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[01:21:47.661 --> 01:21:51.826]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[01:21:51.826 --> 01:21:52.486]  That's Greens75.com.
[01:21:52.486 --> 01:21:52.867]  Greens75.com.
[01:21:59.741 --> 01:22:06.423]  Chronic inflammation is now known to block your ability to repair and compromises your immune system, making you more vulnerable to all diseases.
[01:22:06.423 --> 01:22:11.605]  Since poor diet, injuries, or stress are all contributing factors, many people suffer from inflammation.
[01:22:11.605 --> 01:22:16.747]  Your body's number one means of neutralizing inflammation and the pain that it may be causing is glutathione.
[01:22:16.747 --> 01:22:21.108]  Glutathione is the body's number one peptide to neutralize free radicals and thus stop inflammation.
[01:22:21.108 --> 01:22:22.969]  Hi, my name is Jason.
[01:22:22.969 --> 01:22:23.469]  I'm 44 years old.
[01:22:23.649 --> 01:22:30.016]  For ten years, I had been suffering from chronic pain in my abdomen and groin that radiated down into my feet.
[01:22:30.016 --> 01:22:37.345]  After three weeks on One World Way, the pain in my feet reduced by 50% and the overall pain in my body reduced significantly as well.
[01:22:37.345 --> 01:22:38.406]  I ran out of One World Way
[01:22:38.626 --> 01:22:40.128]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com

[01:24:09.203 --> 01:24:13.546]  Larry Nichols is our guest, and he's been battling cancer.
[01:24:13.546 --> 01:24:16.768]  He doesn't want me to get into that, but we want to keep him around as long as possible.
[01:24:17.689 --> 01:24:19.730]  And he has spent all his money fighting the Clintons.
[01:24:19.730 --> 01:24:22.131]  I appreciate all of you that have been supporting him out there.
[01:24:22.131 --> 01:24:29.974]  If you want to go to his PayPal and give him a donation, that would be a big help in the fight against the Globalists and against the Clintons.
[01:24:29.974 --> 01:24:38.977]  So we'll put that up on screen for TV viewers, and I will give out that address to folks, I guess, at the end of this segment.
[01:24:38.977 --> 01:24:39.838]  There it is, Larry Nichols, 58.
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:53.589]  Kensington Drive, K-E-N-S-I-N-G-T-O-N Drive, Conway, Arkansas, 72034, or NicholsLive at AOL.com on PayPal.
[01:24:53.589 --> 01:24:54.890]  NicholsLive at AOL.com.
[01:24:54.890 --> 01:24:56.451]  We've only got about five minutes left.
[01:24:56.451 --> 01:25:04.798]  I'll have you back up next week to expand on this, Larry, because this is the season of the campaign trail, obviously, but you got cut off by the break.
[01:25:06.727 --> 01:25:12.330]  He used to, I guess, you know, run insurrections and things down in Latin America and things when you were in Special Forces.
[01:25:12.330 --> 01:25:16.131]  This is why the Clintons later hired you to run political campaigns here.
[01:25:16.131 --> 01:25:17.112]  But, but, but Larry...
[01:25:18.209 --> 01:25:21.811]  Obviously, America is on the warpath against this tyranny.
[01:25:21.811 --> 01:25:24.873]  I see the Feds trying to stir up insurrections and stuff out in Oregon.
[01:25:24.873 --> 01:25:26.274]  It's not working.
[01:25:26.274 --> 01:25:30.416]  The Bundys are good folks, but clearly there's a lot of operations going on there.
[01:25:30.416 --> 01:25:33.258]  The optics aren't working, but I don't think they're going to give up.
[01:25:33.258 --> 01:25:34.679]  I think they're going to push it too far.
[01:25:34.679 --> 01:25:37.400]  I'm really worried about a false flag, Larry.
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:43.924]  Well, let me tell you one of the tricks that's coming, and folks, Alex, you and your audience have got to stop it.
[01:25:43.924 --> 01:25:47.346]  The Republican Party is setting Donald Trump up.
[01:25:48.536 --> 01:25:50.397]  For example, this is the oldest trick.
[01:25:50.397 --> 01:25:52.318]  We used to use it all the time.
[01:25:52.318 --> 01:26:09.265]  If you were a Democrat changing your affiliation to Republican, if you were Tea Party, if you were Libertarian, whatever, when you go to change your party affiliation to vote in the Republican primary, here's what's in store for you.
[01:26:09.265 --> 01:26:12.567]  They've got, every state has its own little quirky rules.
[01:26:13.453 --> 01:26:27.437]  And so, for example, New Jersey, if you want to change your party affiliation, sign up to be a Republican so you can vote for Donald Trump in this primary, you have to do it 55 days before the election.
[01:26:27.437 --> 01:26:29.098]  Now, how many people know that?
[01:26:29.098 --> 01:26:34.519]  And by the way, Jeb Bush and others have said they're going to basically take the delegates, and they don't care.
[01:26:34.519 --> 01:26:37.640]  If Jeb Bush gets 2%, he still thinks he's going to be given it.
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:39.241]  And a brokered convention as well.
[01:26:39.241 --> 01:26:40.001]  How do we stop that?
[01:26:40.796 --> 01:26:44.697]  You stop it by, number one, we have to beat him at the ballot box.
[01:26:44.697 --> 01:26:46.378]  We have to start out with Trump.
[01:26:46.378 --> 01:26:51.600]  Trump has got to survive the first three primaries.
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:52.420]  He's got to survive.
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:53.900]  And then he's got to win in a landslide.
[01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:54.961]  It's hard for him to steal that.
[01:26:54.961 --> 01:26:57.602]  I know.
[01:26:57.602 --> 01:27:01.883]  If everybody will check in your state, and dear God, this is so important.
[01:27:02.663 --> 01:27:07.046]  Oklahoma is 25 days, Massachusetts, and people are going to go up.
[01:27:07.046 --> 01:27:08.127]  And think about this, Alex.
[01:27:08.127 --> 01:27:21.917]  If we don't get this addressed, and Trump needs to be doing it more than talking about his plans, if we don't do this, 30 to 50 percent of the votes that show up in Trump's column in the polls, he's not going to get.
[01:27:21.917 --> 01:27:23.318]  They're not going to get to count them.
[01:27:23.318 --> 01:27:24.679]  They're not going to get to count them.
[01:27:24.679 --> 01:27:30.824]  And then if he loses those first three states, they're going to land best him, and everybody in the world is going to say he can't possibly win.
[01:27:32.355 --> 01:27:34.177]  That's step one.
[01:27:34.177 --> 01:27:42.565]  And then step two is just like we said, Alex, we've got to find some place so that we can organize so that people can bond together.
[01:27:43.263 --> 01:27:44.284]  Because they're going to hit us.
[01:27:44.284 --> 01:27:46.445]  They're going to hit us with all kinds of disinformation.
[01:27:46.445 --> 01:27:48.726]  They're going to try to scare everybody.
[01:27:48.726 --> 01:27:49.566]  I agree.
[01:27:49.566 --> 01:27:52.067]  And they're upping their troll operations, dirty tricks right now.
[01:27:52.067 --> 01:27:54.129]  It is a circus around here.
[01:27:54.129 --> 01:27:56.050]  But it's very exciting.
[01:27:56.050 --> 01:27:59.871]  And so people just need to be extremely vigilant, active.
[01:27:59.871 --> 01:28:02.313]  But the good news is the mainstream media is discredited.
[01:28:02.313 --> 01:28:03.613]  This is not 1995 or so.
[01:28:03.613 --> 01:28:04.834]  That's right.
[01:28:04.834 --> 01:28:07.795]  When they can just blow up a federal building and blame it on us.
[01:28:07.795 --> 01:28:12.398]  And do you think the establishment knows that they're out of bullets and knows how weak they are?
[01:28:13.157 --> 01:28:14.338]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:14.338 --> 01:28:15.859]  I know they do.
[01:28:15.859 --> 01:28:21.001]  And remember, if you want to put it in the venue of a war, remember this.
[01:28:21.001 --> 01:28:23.283]  To win a war, you gotta win battles.
[01:28:23.283 --> 01:28:26.424]  You don't just jump right out and fight the war and win it.
[01:28:26.424 --> 01:28:35.129]  Now remember, the first step we've got to take is ensure Trump that he gets... Your Skype just broke up.
[01:28:35.129 --> 01:28:37.130]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:28:37.130 --> 01:28:37.771]  Your Skype broke up.
[01:28:38.556 --> 01:28:41.519]  And then, when we do that, then we organize.
[01:28:41.519 --> 01:28:44.802]  And he would be a hell of a thing to organize around.
[01:28:44.802 --> 01:28:51.888]  I'm just worried that some of his consultants and advisors, hey, they haven't been saying anything about the trickery with the votes.
[01:28:53.176 --> 01:28:54.678]  They've not mentioned it.
[01:28:54.678 --> 01:28:56.680]  And that's the key to his entire election.
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:01.385]  Well, I know Stone, one of his top advisors, is worried about it and Trump's involved and understands it.
[01:29:01.385 --> 01:29:03.447]  I just don't think they think it's time to roll that out yet.
[01:29:03.447 --> 01:29:05.770]  But behind the scenes, we've been working on it.
[01:29:05.770 --> 01:29:10.014]  But I saw when we played that Trump clip when you first came on, you got excited when we were watching him.
[01:29:10.014 --> 01:29:11.596]  You really like Trump, don't you?
[01:29:11.596 --> 01:29:12.257]  You think he's for real.
[01:29:14.667 --> 01:29:17.569]  That was my question to Larry, and his Skype just broke up again.
[01:29:17.569 --> 01:29:19.811]  That is such an important question.
[01:29:19.811 --> 01:29:22.073]  We'll see if Larry Nichols' Skype comes back up.
[01:29:22.073 --> 01:29:26.537]  A wonderful technology, obviously, but we lost it right there.
[01:29:26.537 --> 01:29:36.265]  When he comes back, ask him what he really thinks of Trump, and tell Nichols, sit around for 30 minutes, unless he's got to go, and I'll have him on for that 5 minutes at the start of the next hour to finish up.
[01:29:36.265 --> 01:29:39.828]  We have Norm Singleton, head of Campaign for Liberty.
[01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:43.553]  Joining us to talk about Audit the Fed, Rand Paul and more.
[01:29:43.553 --> 01:29:45.154]  Rand Paul's coming on next hour.
[01:29:45.154 --> 01:29:46.455]  I got newspapers calling me.
[01:29:46.455 --> 01:29:49.478]  Gotta call the Daily Beast back during this break.
[01:29:49.478 --> 01:29:50.880]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:53.402]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.402 --> 01:29:56.085]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.497 --> 01:30:06.499]  The first Republican debate of 2016 is this Thursday, January 14th.
[01:30:06.499 --> 01:30:12.922]  And join the InfoWars Nightly News and Prison Planet TV once again for Political Science Theater 3K.
[01:30:12.922 --> 01:30:16.183]  The stage will be getting smaller with only six candidates making the cut.
[01:30:16.183 --> 01:30:19.505]  Maybe seven if they let John Kasich slip in through the back door.
[01:30:19.505 --> 01:30:20.665]  Coverage starts at 7 p.m.
[01:30:20.665 --> 01:30:24.087]  Central on the InfoWars Nightly News and then the debate kicks off at 8 p.m.
[01:30:24.087 --> 01:30:24.387]  Central.
[01:30:24.727 --> 01:30:28.291]  Join us for analysis that cuts through the lies in real time.
[01:30:28.291 --> 01:30:30.012]  When's the next Democratic debate, you ask?
[01:30:30.012 --> 01:30:33.736]  Well, it's on a Sunday during the NFL playoffs, because that's when most people want to watch it.
[01:30:33.736 --> 01:30:39.182]  It does not appear that Rand Paul is going to make the cut in this primetime debate, but John Kasich is?
[01:30:39.182 --> 01:30:40.303]  What is this world coming to?
[01:30:40.663 --> 01:30:47.828]  Just a little side note here, the majority of Americans polled think that Hillary Clinton should continue to run if she is indicted under this new email scandal.
[01:30:47.828 --> 01:30:49.489]  Join us this Thursday, 7 p.m.
[01:30:49.489 --> 01:30:52.851]  Central, for Political Science Theater 3K.
[01:30:52.851 --> 01:30:55.212]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:30:59.795 --> 01:31:03.297]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:03.297 --> 01:31:11.541]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:11.541 --> 01:31:16.964]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:31:16.964 --> 01:31:19.505]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:31:19.505 --> 01:31:21.606]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[01:31:21.606 --> 01:31:25.789]  Secure your DNA force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:31:29.756 --> 01:31:30.676]  Shower Filters.
[01:31:30.676 --> 01:31:32.397]  We're introducing the best yet.
[01:31:32.397 --> 01:31:36.458]  The brand new ProPure ProMax High Performance Shower Filter.
[01:31:36.458 --> 01:31:41.279]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[01:31:41.279 --> 01:31:48.360]  This new 4-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.

[01:31:59.423 --> 01:32:05.666]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, you can get six months free at PrisonPlanet.TV, but only for one more week.
[01:32:05.666 --> 01:32:16.250]  We've never offered six months free before, but I really want to get more people to join and be able to watch the nightly news, live reports, the special reports, all my films, e-books, and so much more.
[01:32:16.250 --> 01:32:19.772]  One person can share their membership with 20 people.
[01:32:19.912 --> 01:32:24.736]  We have to have our own platform that is harder for them to censor, harder for the system to shut down.
[01:32:24.736 --> 01:32:26.497]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:26.497 --> 01:32:32.342]  We put out the daily radio show free with the video and audio feeds at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:32:32.342 --> 01:32:39.788]  But it is the members that are paying it forward and helping so many other people see the truth.
[01:32:39.788 --> 01:32:46.453]  And it's PrisonPlanet.tv that finances so much of the cameras, the equipment, the crew, the reporters.
[01:32:46.813 --> 01:32:52.664]  You get exclusive HD higher quality, get it first, and then you can download it, share it with friends and family.
[01:32:52.664 --> 01:32:57.031]  It's a win-win, and then you're helping finance to put it out for free to everybody.
[01:32:57.031 --> 01:32:58.033]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:33:10.171 --> 01:33:15.244]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.394 --> 01:33:33.537]  One thing I see out there, just happened today, in Tehran, they're burning down the Saudi embassy.
[01:33:33.537 --> 01:33:34.217]  You see that?
[01:33:34.217 --> 01:33:37.839]  Now, what that is, is Iran wants to take over Saudi Arabia.
[01:33:37.839 --> 01:33:38.899]  They always have.
[01:33:38.899 --> 01:33:40.120]  They want the oil, okay?
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:41.300]  They've always wanted that.
[01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:44.342]  They have a bunch of dishonest people.
[01:33:44.342 --> 01:33:46.183]  They've created ISIS.
[01:33:46.183 --> 01:33:50.264]  Hillary Clinton created ISIS with Obama.
[01:33:50.264 --> 01:33:51.705]  Created with Obama.
[01:33:54.309 --> 01:34:01.235]  It is so stunning to have the Republican presidential frontrunner Donald J. Trump saying that and saying it again over the last few weeks.
[01:34:01.235 --> 01:34:08.661]  But it's Rand Paul and then Ted Cruz following his lead three years ago saying, don't become Al Qaeda's air force.
[01:34:08.661 --> 01:34:15.567]  That then became what was left of Al Qaeda, the new ISIS that grew to hundreds of thousands.
[01:34:15.567 --> 01:34:20.731]  And Rand Paul will be joining us to talk election 2016 and audit the Fed at like 15 after next hour.
[01:34:22.731 --> 01:34:33.676]  And I can't believe that John Kasich, the governor, polling with like two points is in the debate, but Rand Paul isn't, when he was the presidential frontrunner six months ago.
[01:34:33.676 --> 01:34:38.118]  And I don't believe these polls, there's even articles out saying they've been skewing the polls.
[01:34:38.118 --> 01:34:40.098]  And they're going to do it to other people too.
[01:34:40.098 --> 01:34:43.540]  I've told folks I'd be happy with a Rand Paul, a Ted Cruz, or a Donald Trump.
[01:34:46.388 --> 01:34:57.011]  Anything over Hillary, and I've never been a lesser of two evils, but there's no lesser of anything here with Hillary or Biden or that socialist Bernie Sanders.
[01:34:57.011 --> 01:34:58.211]  It's amazing.
[01:34:58.211 --> 01:35:10.514]  But let's cut past the puppets and get to who really runs things, the private central banks that operate through the private Federal Reserve, the consortium, the Royal Bank of Scotland, all of these fronts.
[01:35:10.514 --> 01:35:14.055]  These central banks run the world now, are appointing leaders, they've taken over.
[01:35:15.074 --> 01:35:17.715]  And it's the private Federal Reserve in this country.
[01:35:17.715 --> 01:35:18.795]  In fact, can we queue that up?
[01:35:18.795 --> 01:35:21.296]  I only play that a few times a year.
[01:35:21.296 --> 01:35:33.359]  We should queue up the Laird News Hour footage from a few years ago when the former head of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, the architect of our current economy and the derivatives and the rest of it says,
[01:35:34.502 --> 01:35:36.704]  There is no role for Congress in the Federal Reserve.
[01:35:36.704 --> 01:35:41.727]  The proper role is they have no authority and they have no oversight over us and cannot touch anything we do.
[01:35:41.727 --> 01:35:44.650]  Well, I mean, Congress isn't above the law.
[01:35:44.650 --> 01:35:47.051]  The executive's not above the law.
[01:35:47.051 --> 01:35:47.892]  The judicial's not.
[01:35:47.892 --> 01:35:51.415]  But I mean, this is a separate group that calls itself federal and isn't.
[01:35:52.432 --> 01:35:55.474]  You know, if somebody calls themselves royalty and isn't, they get discredited.
[01:35:55.474 --> 01:36:00.677]  Or if somebody calls themselves a highly decorated veteran and they're not, it's disgraceful.
[01:36:00.677 --> 01:36:04.380]  But what about when you say you're the federal government and you're not?
[01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:05.160]  You were set up in 1913.
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:13.226]  Now we had on probably the greatest actual technical champion of the Second Amendment.
[01:36:13.226 --> 01:36:20.010]  I mean, you could say that overall promoting it, it'd be somebody like Ted Nugent or myself.
[01:36:20.010 --> 01:36:22.112]  But when you talk about actually in there,
[01:36:24.046 --> 01:36:34.994]  Defending it technically at the Capitol Hill level, forcing the NRA to behave themselves, it's somebody like Larry Pratt, gun owners of America.
[01:36:34.994 --> 01:36:51.565]  Well, when you talk about battling the Federal Reserve and going from not getting one vote twenty-something years ago, to co-sponsor auditing the Fed, to having it pass the House repeatedly, but killed in the Senate by the guy that claimed he was against the corrupt big banks, Bernie Sanders.
[01:36:53.322 --> 01:37:02.085]  So, Ron Paul literally popularized, along with the Liberty Movement, in the last 30 years, exposing the private Fed.
[01:37:02.085 --> 01:37:04.085]  Till now, everybody knows it's private.
[01:37:04.085 --> 01:37:05.946]  They don't call you conspiracy theorists anymore.
[01:37:05.946 --> 01:37:10.207]  Most Americans, what is it, 97% in Gallup polls, wanted audited or abolished.
[01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:20.414]  Very exciting, and joining us is Norm Singleton, and he's worked for Congressman Ron Paul for decades.
[01:37:20.414 --> 01:37:25.537]  He heads up a lot of the operations over at Campaign for Liberty.
[01:37:26.567 --> 01:37:28.368]  And of course, he's also a constitutional lawyer.
[01:37:28.368 --> 01:37:48.939]  I'm not going to go over how he's one of the founding members of some of the biggest Republican caucuses with Libertarians, but he is really one of the brains in there, helping this Libertarian take back of the Republican Party, because it's been taken over by big special interests, you know, since the days after Eisenhower left office.
[01:37:48.939 --> 01:37:54.842]  And then Barry Goldwater fought against the Trilateral Commission and what he called a foreign takeover of our banking, our culture, everything.
[01:37:55.788 --> 01:37:57.678]  So, since the days of Goldwater...
[01:37:59.926 --> 01:38:02.908]  Since the mid-sixties, folks, the Republican Party's been run by the Rockefellers.
[01:38:02.908 --> 01:38:04.670]  It's been called the Rockefeller Republicans.
[01:38:04.670 --> 01:38:06.031]  That's what the Bushes are.
[01:38:06.031 --> 01:38:10.314]  And so Norm Singleton's been in there since he was out of college, battling it from the beginning.
[01:38:10.314 --> 01:38:14.337]  And we're trying to get the private Federal Reserve audited.
[01:38:14.337 --> 01:38:17.259]  You know, it was so sexy to expose it 20 years ago when I was first on air.
[01:38:17.259 --> 01:38:18.780]  People say, you're a liar, it's federal.
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:23.123]  And then I'd say, is Federal Express federal or federal ammunition or federal plumbing?
[01:38:23.123 --> 01:38:27.587]  And then I would show them the Federal Reserve Act on TV and people would wake up.
[01:38:28.171 --> 01:38:31.412]  But now it's like, yeah, we know it's federal and foreign, they're ripping us off.
[01:38:31.412 --> 01:38:32.472]  Tell us something we don't know.
[01:38:32.472 --> 01:38:34.853]  Okay, we've won the war to expose it.
[01:38:34.853 --> 01:38:44.376]  Now let's audit it, show the criminal activity we know is there, most of it going to foreign banks, of your tax money, and let's reform this thing, take it back, put it back in Congress.
[01:38:44.376 --> 01:38:50.198]  I mean, now we've got the President, you know, saying Congress doesn't affect war or guns.
[01:38:50.198 --> 01:38:54.700]  I mean, you keep letting Congress become vestigial, it'll become completely ceremonial.
[01:38:56.049 --> 01:38:59.571]  So I want to play this clip and then go to him for the balance of the hour in the next 24 minutes or so.
[01:38:59.571 --> 01:39:01.772]  Norm Singleton, CampaignForLiberty.org.
[01:39:01.772 --> 01:39:05.534]  They're trying to push this getting passed in the Senate.
[01:39:05.534 --> 01:39:07.135]  Rand Paul's coming on to do this as well.
[01:39:08.916 --> 01:39:10.716]  That's the one question I wanted to ask Donald Trump when he was on.
[01:39:10.716 --> 01:39:11.457]  Would you audit the Fed?
[01:39:11.457 --> 01:39:12.197]  What would you do on the Fed?
[01:39:12.197 --> 01:39:14.357]  I dropped the ball on that and I apologize.
[01:39:14.357 --> 01:39:18.618]  But regardless, that should be a litmus test, folks, because that's the shadow government.
[01:39:18.618 --> 01:39:20.119]  That's the shadow corporate system.
[01:39:20.119 --> 01:39:21.399]  Look at the EU.
[01:39:21.399 --> 01:39:31.101]  But here is the former head of the Fed, the most famous head of the Fed ever, Alan Greenspan, Mr. Irrational Exuberance, whose baby, Ben Bernanke, came in and continued it all.
[01:39:31.101 --> 01:39:32.502]  And now Janet Yellen.
[01:39:32.502 --> 01:39:34.822]  Here he is saying they're above the law.
[01:39:34.822 --> 01:39:38.063]  Outrageous open declaration of tyranny.
[01:39:38.063 --> 01:39:38.363]  Here it is.
[01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:47.797]  I have the ideology because I believe that it is the best way of coming at the world and what type of policy.
[01:39:47.797 --> 01:39:57.206]  What is the proper relationship, what should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[01:39:57.206 --> 01:40:05.073]  Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency and that means basically that there is no
[01:40:06.305 --> 01:40:10.927]  Other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[01:40:10.927 --> 01:40:12.348]  It's not government.
[01:40:12.348 --> 01:40:30.556]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[01:40:32.423 --> 01:40:43.546]  What we think is the appropriate thing to do when the shareholders, since about 1915, are secret, but it's mainly foreign banks that's been admitted in congressional hearings on it.
[01:40:43.546 --> 01:40:48.727]  You got a foreign bank head that calls himself the Federal Reserve.
[01:40:48.727 --> 01:40:53.288]  The other regional banks are all now against it, saying we're all vestigial, we don't even run things.
[01:40:53.288 --> 01:40:54.308]  It's the New York Fed.
[01:40:54.308 --> 01:40:58.309]  They've got the Fed head of Dallas, Kansas City, and other places running around saying it's a tyranny.
[01:40:59.943 --> 01:41:03.367]  Talking like Alex Jones, like Ron Paul, like Norm Singleton.
[01:41:03.367 --> 01:41:05.470]  So, it's 102 years old now, folks. 1913.
[01:41:10.459 --> 01:41:15.782]  And it is a foreign tentacle, and Norm Singleton, CampaignForLiberty.org, is here.
[01:41:15.782 --> 01:41:17.964]  This is such an important fight.
[01:41:17.964 --> 01:41:20.645]  This is one of the most important key fights there is.
[01:41:20.645 --> 01:41:34.234]  It's as important as the Second Amendment to kick out this foreign banking power, because if you ever allow private banks to control the issuance of currency and credit, your children will wake up homeless on the continent your forebearers conquered, to quote a founding father.
[01:41:35.578 --> 01:41:36.999]  And that's what we now have, folks.
[01:41:36.999 --> 01:41:40.581]  We are conquered through fraud, but if we wake up to it, it's over.
[01:41:40.581 --> 01:41:45.864]  Norm, thank you so much for coming on with us, my friend, and holding while I did that dissertation.
[01:41:45.864 --> 01:41:48.466]  Tell us about the current fight, sir.
[01:41:48.466 --> 01:41:49.787]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:41:49.787 --> 01:41:51.888]  Thank you for having me on.
[01:41:51.888 --> 01:41:54.530]  Yesterday, there was an historic vote in the Senate.
[01:41:55.308 --> 01:42:01.494]  A majority of senators voted for the Audit the Fed legislation introduced by Senator Rand Paul.
[01:42:01.494 --> 01:42:06.218]  Only one Republican, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, voted against it.
[01:42:06.218 --> 01:42:08.861]  Senator Sanders actually did vote for it, although
[01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:21.466]  The so-called populist champion of the progressive left, Elizabeth Warren, voted against it, and she has actually been very outspoken against auditing the Fed ever since she got to the Senate.
[01:42:21.466 --> 01:42:30.951]  So anyone who thinks that, well, even though she's a leftist, even though she's for big government, Jesus, her heart is in the right place.
[01:42:30.951 --> 01:42:31.752]  I think you should
[01:42:32.672 --> 01:42:48.106]  Reassess that because when it comes right down to it, she's just as in favor of corporate welfare and corporatism and the big banks and Wall Street and the big special interests as Hillary Clinton or a Jeb Bush.
[01:42:48.106 --> 01:42:57.155]  The only difference is that her rhetoric is is better and she likes to pretend that her socialist proposals will help the average person.
[01:42:58.504 --> 01:43:03.060]  So what we're looking at now, because we didn't get the 60 votes to break the filibuster,
[01:43:04.750 --> 01:43:30.237]  We are looking at where we go from here, and we're probably going to go back to the House and see if Paul Ryan will have a vote that will put the bill back on the Senate calendar once it passes the House, and it will enable us to continue to put pressure on the Senators who voted with the Fed, with the big banks.
[01:43:30.237 --> 01:43:33.378]  And this is really, as you said, this is an important issue because
[01:43:34.193 --> 01:43:38.436]  We don't know everything that's going on down there with the Fed.
[01:43:38.436 --> 01:43:45.442]  We don't know what deals they're making with foreign central banks, with foreign government, with Wall Street firms, with corporations.
[01:43:45.442 --> 01:43:54.029]  Since the 2008 collapse, they've started, I believe, actually buying assets of corporations, claiming that they're allowed to do that.
[01:43:54.029 --> 01:43:57.311]  They've been making tremendous deals with overseas
[01:43:59.273 --> 01:44:08.517]  Thanks, and you just don't know what is going on with them in situations like with Greece.
[01:44:08.517 --> 01:44:18.182]  And as Ron Paul points out, the economy is not doing well, and the Fed is failing, and what is going to happen?
[01:44:18.182 --> 01:44:24.806]  And we need to get a full picture of the economy, and the key to that, as you point out, Alex, is monetary policy.
[01:44:25.206 --> 01:44:43.426]  That's why auditing the Fed is a really important step to take and it's really shameful that so many Democrats who claim to be champions of the working of the working person of working class Americans against the so-called 1% voted with the banksters yesterday.
[01:44:44.810 --> 01:45:11.745]  Absolutely, and then we see all the usual suspects, Soros, Gates, Buffett, on sponsored news articles that Laird admits paid for by their foundations, and sponsored this week with ABC, I've seen it four or five times, on purpose tuned in to see if it's sponsored by them, it'll be anti-gun, anti-family, pro-open border, pro-socialism, pro-welfare, and Warren Buffett on, or Bill Gates going, rich people don't pay tax, we need to pay tax, pass this law,
[01:45:12.145 --> 01:45:14.968]  That's raising taxes on people making $100,000 a year.
[01:45:14.968 --> 01:45:17.131]  Those are the people that actually are out there spending money.
[01:45:17.131 --> 01:45:18.693]  That's not ultra-rich or wealthy.
[01:45:19.850 --> 01:45:33.355]  It's billionaires that are basically tax-exempt that are, and there they are, suckering the poor people into voting for them when Bernie Sanders and Hillary, I mean, Hillary's more Wall Street than anybody with these big scams.
[01:45:33.355 --> 01:45:42.078]  Not General Wall Street, that's a great part of our economy, but the crony guys, the top big five, six banks and brokerage firms, as you know, that literally get all the free Federal Reserve money.
[01:45:42.538 --> 01:45:44.418]  And the interest-free money and the bailouts.
[01:45:44.418 --> 01:45:52.660]  I mean, it's just crazy to know that Warren Buffett's the biggest single individual recipient of the bailout.
[01:45:52.660 --> 01:45:58.821]  And he sits there calling for taxes to be raised and talks about how he's getting too much money from the taxpayer.
[01:45:58.821 --> 01:46:02.562]  I mean, he really is counting on the public's ignorance.
[01:46:02.562 --> 01:46:03.282]  That's right.
[01:46:03.282 --> 01:46:08.703]  And the whole political class is really...
[01:46:11.070 --> 01:46:29.629]  Are really scared of, I think, of the Audit the Fed movement because it is popular because under the leadership of Dr. Paul and Campaign for Liberty and in the Senate under the leadership of Senator Paul and in the House, the great Thomas Massidy of Kentucky,
[01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:35.555]  This has really become something that can't be ignored, an issue that can't be ignored anymore.
[01:46:35.555 --> 01:46:51.671]  And more and more people are waking up every day and listening to shows like yours, going to sites like ours, CampaignForLiberty.org, and other sites, Dr. Paul's Liberty Report, in order to learn the full truth and get active in trying to stop this.
[01:46:52.892 --> 01:47:04.578]  The more liberty we lose, the more that measures like audit defense fail, the more people wake up to what's going on.
[01:47:07.837 --> 01:47:17.541]  Uh, determined to change things and to resist the lies of the political class and say that, uh, oh, don't worry, the Federal Reserve is there for your own good.
[01:47:17.541 --> 01:47:29.066]  And Alan Greenspan, incredible arrogance to say that, well, Congress, which created the Federal Reserve by statute, and I don't know if Dr. Greenspan is aware of the legislative process.
[01:47:29.066 --> 01:47:34.489]  Maybe he never watched Schoolhouse Rock and knows, so knows how a bill becomes law, but any bill
[01:47:35.109 --> 01:47:38.191]  They have the power of the coin and the currency.
[01:47:48.817 --> 01:47:53.677]  The idea that we deserve independence is ridiculous.
[01:47:53.677 --> 01:47:58.818]  A bunch of foreign banks have declared their own Declaration of Independence over our money.
[01:47:58.818 --> 01:47:59.818]  Keep it all secret.
[01:47:59.818 --> 01:48:00.378]  Taxes.
[01:48:00.378 --> 01:48:09.520]  Created the IRS the same year to go around like the Sheriff of Nottingham robbing us and then tell us they're above the law and cannot be investigated for 102 years.
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:14.621]  It's outrageous and the beginning of the end is here for these people because now their secret is out.
[01:48:14.621 --> 01:48:15.021]  It took us
[01:48:15.741 --> 01:48:20.384]  80-something years to expose they were private, now it's admitted they are uncloaked.
[01:48:20.384 --> 01:48:24.666]  And they now just hope they can get us to move along and go to sleep, but it's not going to happen.
[01:48:24.666 --> 01:48:30.689]  What do we do, because we're so close, to get this audit the Fed rammed through the Senate, sir?
[01:48:30.689 --> 01:48:35.892]  I should say, when I said that they don't deserve independence, I meant independence of congressional oversight.
[01:48:35.892 --> 01:48:36.652]  No, no, I agree with you.
[01:48:36.652 --> 01:48:39.654]  I was just making the point that they are literally usurping us.
[01:48:39.654 --> 01:48:43.716]  It's like saying a bank robber wants his independence over the cash inside the vault.
[01:48:44.995 --> 01:48:53.482]  I think the most important thing to do right now is go to CampaignForLiberty.org and look up the vote, look up how your Senator voted.
[01:48:53.482 --> 01:48:57.766]  If your Senator voted wrong, call and let them know how disappointed you are with them.
[01:48:57.766 --> 01:49:02.550]  If your Senator voted right, you can always call and thank them.
[01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:10.256]  If your Senator was one of three who didn't vote, call and express your disappointment and ask that they vote in the future for it.
[01:49:13.306 --> 01:49:17.310]  Also, get your friends and neighbors and family members involved, too.
[01:49:17.310 --> 01:49:18.371]  Talk to them about this.
[01:49:18.371 --> 01:49:22.734]  Get them educated and involved in this.
[01:49:22.734 --> 01:49:32.923]  On our site and other sites, we have great educational materials produced by Ron Paul and others.
[01:49:33.985 --> 01:49:34.666]  Absolutely!
[01:49:51.681 --> 01:50:05.572]  Because we have to lead the future against crony capitalism that is scapegoating and demonizing real capitalism, the fount of so much freedom and wealth and success and civilization, while they trash it, blaming beautiful capitalism.
[01:50:05.572 --> 01:50:06.893]  It's totally sick.
[01:50:06.893 --> 01:50:09.315]  Meanwhile, I think they've jumped the shark.
[01:50:09.315 --> 01:50:11.917]  I want to come back and ask you about this in the final segment, Norm.
[01:50:13.203 --> 01:50:15.164]  Again, heading up campaignforliberty.org.
[01:50:15.164 --> 01:50:23.731]  I want to ask you, and heads up the founder of the Republican Liberty Caucus as well, one of the largest caucuses now and growing, taking the Republican Party over beautifully at the federal level.
[01:50:23.731 --> 01:50:24.911]  Very, very close.
[01:50:24.911 --> 01:50:29.214]  I want to ask you when we come back, and my point is these folks are taking action.
[01:50:29.214 --> 01:50:29.855]  They mean business.
[01:50:29.855 --> 01:50:31.036]  You want to actually have success.
[01:50:31.036 --> 01:50:32.016]  It's not all sexy.
[01:50:32.016 --> 01:50:33.217]  It's not all glitzy.
[01:50:33.217 --> 01:50:35.979]  This is where the boots on the ground have the effect.
[01:50:35.979 --> 01:50:38.061]  Long term, we're finally hitting that point.
[01:50:39.025 --> 01:50:44.488]  But haven't they jumped the shark coming out with the guns, the executive power grabs, kind of like Napoleon or Hitler?
[01:50:44.488 --> 01:50:46.809]  They just think they're invincible in their own bubble.
[01:50:46.809 --> 01:50:52.012]  They're doing stuff that I'm seeing is causing irrevocable harm to their whole globalist agenda.
[01:50:52.012 --> 01:50:54.913]  I'm not saying we're winning yet, but we're almost there, folks.
[01:50:54.913 --> 01:50:56.634]  I mean, they're in trouble.
[01:50:56.634 --> 01:50:58.035]  The momentum's on our side.
[01:50:58.035 --> 01:50:59.176]  I want to get his take on that.
[01:51:00.083 --> 01:51:01.444]  Are you prepared to bug out?

[01:53:56.146 --> 01:53:57.747]  Again, that's LibertyOnCall.org.
[01:54:00.626 --> 01:54:03.429]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:54:03.429 --> 01:54:06.213]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:07.748 --> 01:54:11.711]  By the way, folks, I've always been a big supporter for Campaign for Liberty.
[01:54:11.711 --> 01:54:18.476]  And even though, because he's the frontrunner, I'm, you know, leaning towards Trump because I want him or Cruz if Rand Paul isn't the leader.
[01:54:18.476 --> 01:54:21.177]  I've been a big supporter for Rand Paul for president.
[01:54:21.177 --> 01:54:22.098]  And I know he's for real.
[01:54:22.098 --> 01:54:22.959]  I know he's a statesman.
[01:54:22.959 --> 01:54:25.180]  I think he'd make a great president.
[01:54:25.180 --> 01:54:28.663]  And he's coming on a little bit, and I hope to talk about that, you know, ways to get him.
[01:54:28.663 --> 01:54:29.904]  I've said he needs to be more aggressive.
[01:54:29.904 --> 01:54:31.004]  People want that.
[01:54:31.004 --> 01:54:35.668]  America is in an uprising mode, and they want to hear, you know, firing brimstone.
[01:54:36.704 --> 01:54:41.245]  And Rand Paul's joining us to talk about Audit the Fed 2016 and more.
[01:54:41.245 --> 01:54:45.146]  But that said, I'm a big supporter of Campaign for Liberty.org.
[01:54:45.146 --> 01:54:52.968]  By the way, Norm, I saw on your site, if you've got this pulled up, you guys are doing a gun giveaway raffle as well for folks coming to the site and getting involved.
[01:54:52.968 --> 01:54:56.489]  Tell people about when the gun Obama wants to ban.
[01:54:58.632 --> 01:55:08.395]  Well, yes, we're giving away a Colt AR-15 rifle, which is a gun that President Obama has mentioned by name in one of his anti-gun tirades.
[01:55:08.395 --> 01:55:16.318]  You know, he's talked about trying to replicate the British Empire.
[01:55:16.318 --> 01:55:25.220]  He is actually, you know, with his executive orders, going after our Second Amendment, taking away due process of senior citizens and people on Social Security.
[01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:26.981]  He's behaving exactly like King George!
[01:55:27.915 --> 01:55:29.275]  Yes, yes, just awful.
[01:55:29.275 --> 01:55:40.459]  So if you go to ChooseLiberty.org right now, you can do two things to aggravate President Obama and the rest of the statists in Washington.
[01:55:40.459 --> 01:55:47.221]  You can sign an Audit the Fed petition at the House to get them to move and help us advance this cause further.
[01:55:47.221 --> 01:55:51.362]  And you can sign up to win an AR-15 rifle.
[01:55:51.362 --> 01:55:55.243]  The drawing ends, it's going to be January 31st at midnight.
[01:55:55.843 --> 01:56:02.287]  And you can make a statement to President Obama and the rest of his little cronies in D.C.
[01:56:02.287 --> 01:56:06.649]  that we're not going to sit back silently and let you take away our Second Amendment rights.
[01:56:06.649 --> 01:56:12.492]  We're going to assert them vigorously by entering this.
[01:56:12.492 --> 01:56:13.053]  Absolutely.
[01:56:13.053 --> 01:56:14.253]  And that brings me to my final point.
[01:56:14.253 --> 01:56:15.334]  We've only got one minute left, sir.
[01:56:15.794 --> 01:56:17.255]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:56:17.255 --> 01:56:20.876]  You heard my whole rant earlier, a couple minute rant about the Great Awakening happening.
[01:56:20.876 --> 01:56:22.076]  People finally get it.
[01:56:22.076 --> 01:56:23.197]  They're not buying it.
[01:56:23.197 --> 01:56:25.758]  Do you think they're delusional and insulated in D.C.
[01:56:25.758 --> 01:56:26.778]  and don't realize what's happening?
[01:56:26.778 --> 01:56:27.719]  Because that's better.
[01:56:27.719 --> 01:56:29.299]  That means we're really going to win.
[01:56:29.299 --> 01:56:31.100]  Or are they aware of how much trouble they're in?
[01:56:32.735 --> 01:56:35.358]  I actually think that it's split.
[01:56:35.358 --> 01:56:49.976]  There's a lot of delusion, but there also is an increasing realization, and that's why you see a lot of senators and congressmen lining up to get behind out at the Fed, because they understand that people want change, and politicians
[01:56:50.656 --> 01:56:58.299]  We'll respond with change when enough people demand it.
[01:56:58.299 --> 01:57:06.762]  Congressman Paul brilliantly summed that up in his column this week, which is available at campaignforliberty.org and other sites.
[01:57:07.622 --> 01:57:08.382]  Absolutely.
[01:57:08.382 --> 01:57:16.406]  Don't educate the politicians, educate the people, and then when the people know the truth and the people demand liberty, the politicians will follow.
[01:57:16.406 --> 01:57:17.407]  That's what Thomas Jefferson said.
[01:57:17.407 --> 01:57:25.971]  He said educate the people generally and the concepts of liberty and tyranny will fade away like phantoms at dawn in the mist, to paraphrase.
[01:57:25.971 --> 01:57:26.571]  God bless you, sir.
[01:57:26.571 --> 01:57:27.492]  I appreciate you joining us.
[01:57:28.424 --> 01:57:29.165]  God bless you, sir.
[01:57:44.404 --> 01:57:47.086]  That's why we're so successful, because we're committed in this war.
[01:57:47.086 --> 01:57:48.887]  I'm not in competition with other liberty groups.
[01:57:48.887 --> 01:57:52.870]  I'm here to try to just literally just bleed out for them if I need to.
[01:57:52.870 --> 01:57:56.132]  I mean, I'm committed to the Tree of Liberty 110%.
[01:57:56.132 --> 01:58:01.316]  Super Female Vitality is back after a month and a half being sold out.
[01:58:01.316 --> 01:58:06.660]  It's got concentrated cold-pressed herbs and compounds that just try it, and you're supporting the broadcast.
[01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:07.901]  There's nothing like it out there.
[01:58:07.901 --> 01:58:10.062]  Read the rave reviews.
[01:58:10.062 --> 01:58:12.244]  You know, four and a half star reviews, unprecedented.

[01:58:17.075 --> 01:58:21.239]  We've got it where you can get X-Tube and get a silver bullet with it half price.

[01:58:31.368 --> 01:58:34.651]  It's simply amazing and has the fastest flow of anyone out there.
[01:58:34.651 --> 01:58:36.873]  InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:58:50.197 --> 01:58:54.561]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[01:58:54.561 --> 01:58:58.724]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[01:59:19.941 --> 01:59:21.062]  BrainForce is here.
[01:59:21.062 --> 01:59:23.263]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:59:23.263 --> 01:59:28.247]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:59:28.247 --> 01:59:31.549]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:59:31.549 --> 01:59:35.032]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:59:35.032 --> 01:59:37.013]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:59:37.013 --> 01:59:39.115]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:59:39.115 --> 01:59:41.116]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[01:59:51.989 --> 02:00:01.275]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:01.275 --> 02:00:02.115]  Another world.
[02:00:02.115 --> 02:00:03.276]  Another time.
[02:00:03.276 --> 02:00:04.317]  In the age of wonder.
[02:00:28.299 --> 02:00:32.940]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:32.940 --> 02:00:45.865]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:45.865 --> 02:00:49.526]  Coming up, Rand Paul scheduled to be with us in about 15 minutes, calling in.
[02:00:52.933 --> 02:00:54.414]  State of the Union was such a doozy.
[02:00:54.414 --> 02:00:56.435]  I'm going to be honest, I couldn't watch but half of it.
[02:00:56.435 --> 02:00:58.076]  And then I read the transcript of the rest.
[02:00:58.076 --> 02:00:59.037]  I just can't do it anymore.
[02:00:59.037 --> 02:01:02.459]  Because they think they're so powerful.
[02:01:02.459 --> 02:01:04.421]  The red carpets and the fancy suits.
[02:01:04.421 --> 02:01:07.263]  They're all a bunch of crazy egomaniacs.
[02:01:07.263 --> 02:01:12.926]  They don't know the real power is being honorable and building the species to the stars.
[02:01:12.926 --> 02:01:13.747]  I can't look at Hillary.
[02:01:14.864 --> 02:01:16.985]  I can't look at the Republicans that go along with it.
[02:01:16.985 --> 02:01:25.267]  Paul Ryan's sitting behind him, trying to act like he thought Obama was full of bull, and the two hang out together and play ball.
[02:01:25.267 --> 02:01:27.628]  And it's not like they're just boss hog corruption.
[02:01:27.628 --> 02:01:33.229]  That I would fight against, but I wouldn't be mortally, you know, in a death battle with.
[02:01:33.229 --> 02:01:38.211]  But these globalists, they are just the trash of the earth.
[02:01:38.211 --> 02:01:43.012]  We've got to make it past our own evil selves in the manifestation of these people.
[02:01:44.585 --> 02:01:45.967]  Then we're gonna go to the next level.
[02:01:45.967 --> 02:01:56.863]  I mean, you don't think the devil's just gonna let us into the heavens?
[02:01:56.863 --> 02:01:59.007]  What do the gods do that go to heaven?
[02:01:59.007 --> 02:02:00.228]  What do the angels do that go to heaven?
[02:02:01.394 --> 02:02:06.921]  God made this planet for us to grow up on, to test us before we go to the next level.
[02:02:06.921 --> 02:02:10.585]  Spiritually and physically, everything is multi-faceted in the universe.
[02:02:10.585 --> 02:02:12.928]  It comes in threes, it comes in fives.
[02:02:12.928 --> 02:02:20.076]  I never really studied sacred geometry until it became self-evident to me and then I went out and researched it and found out the ancients all understood this.
[02:02:20.837 --> 02:02:23.619]  Again, we live on through those that died before us.
[02:02:23.619 --> 02:02:26.201]  They live on through us, through our progeny.
[02:02:26.201 --> 02:02:36.748]  Our ideas live on in what we manifest and build and what we teach in the culture through others that aren't even in our genetic line, like electricity.
[02:02:36.748 --> 02:02:48.436]  And then we live on spiritually, not just by the quote, energy of the soul that they've measured, the wavelength, the aura that dies, but only because it leaves the body.
[02:02:49.622 --> 02:02:54.785]  And that goes on forever.
[02:02:54.785 --> 02:03:16.216]  But that energy, that soul, that spirit with all that information that predates this planet and even this creation coming forth out of the mind of God like flowing water in the time-space continuum blasting out the other end of a black hole straight into our universe can resonate with evil or good
[02:03:21.243 --> 02:03:27.845]  And there's a broadcast that the world is putting out to resonate and to join with evil.
[02:03:27.845 --> 02:03:32.727]  And my soul is like a violin.
[02:03:32.727 --> 02:03:34.128]  So is yours or a harp.
[02:03:34.128 --> 02:03:44.311]  I think it's how it's more often pointed out.
[02:03:44.311 --> 02:03:46.632]  And the world can play my flesh and play my heart.
[02:03:49.167 --> 02:03:59.734]  And sometimes it can even touch my soul, but despite the fact that I have knowledge of evil, and that means I'm evil, I don't act on it and I don't exercise it because the good is much greater.
[02:03:59.734 --> 02:04:03.797]  And that is the secret to the universe, my friends.
[02:04:03.797 --> 02:04:08.920]  Good people get guilty because we feel the evil in us and we think, my God, this is who I am.
[02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:10.761]  It's not your essence.
[02:04:10.761 --> 02:04:16.165]  It's that you're able to feel the broadcast of that spiritual energy in that dimension.
[02:04:18.757 --> 02:04:24.745]  Our mind, the mathematics shows, goes to the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th dimension and above.
[02:04:24.745 --> 02:04:29.291]  And so we're blind physically in this 3rd dimensional plane to it.
[02:04:29.291 --> 02:04:32.816]  But we feel it in the 6th sense.
[02:04:32.816 --> 02:04:33.357]  And we know it.
[02:04:37.538 --> 02:04:43.801]  And so what we have is a bunch of vandals and scum that look big on this plane because they decided to be evil.
[02:04:43.801 --> 02:04:45.382]  But really, they're little jokes.
[02:04:45.382 --> 02:04:46.522]  They're weak.
[02:04:46.522 --> 02:04:52.945]  And they're so afraid of good men and women who are empowered and have the light of God in their eyes.
[02:04:52.945 --> 02:04:53.545]  We'll be back.
[02:04:53.545 --> 02:04:54.425]  Stay with us.
[02:04:54.425 --> 02:04:54.806]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:04:54.806 --> 02:05:00.028]  This is Infowars.com.
[02:05:00.028 --> 02:05:04.370]  Remember when Congressman Joe Wilson couldn't contain himself any longer and shouted at Obama?
[02:05:07.825 --> 02:05:11.449]  We needed that on a loop for Obama's last State of the Union.
[02:05:11.449 --> 02:05:14.572]  A story on FOWars.com looks at three of his biggest lies.
[02:05:14.572 --> 02:05:23.881]  Obama continues to pretend we're focused on destroying ISIS when there's been a continuous stream of information showing we created, funded, and armed ISIS and continue to do so.
[02:05:24.261 --> 02:05:30.869]  He claimed Obamacare created jobs when in fact it caused companies that can't afford it to replace full-time jobs with part-time jobs.
[02:05:30.869 --> 02:05:34.194]  But hey, you now have two different jobs to make ends meet.
[02:05:34.194 --> 02:05:35.535]  Why are you complaining?
[02:05:35.535 --> 02:05:38.199]  And then there's the strongest economy in the world claim.
[02:05:38.199 --> 02:05:40.762]  The reality is all jobs growth has gone to immigrants.
[02:05:41.082 --> 02:05:42.683]  For more information, go to Infowars.com.
[02:05:42.683 --> 02:05:43.363]  I'm David Knight.
[02:05:59.770 --> 02:06:06.017]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, you can get six months free at PrisonPlanet.TV, but only for one more week.
[02:06:06.017 --> 02:06:16.609]  We've never offered six months free before, but I really want to get more people to join and be able to watch the nightly news, live reports, the special reports, all my films, e-books, and so much more.
[02:06:16.609 --> 02:06:20.133]  One person can share their membership with 20 people.
[02:06:20.273 --> 02:06:25.077]  We have to have our own platform that is harder for them to censor, harder for the system to shut down.
[02:06:25.077 --> 02:06:26.858]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:26.858 --> 02:06:32.703]  We put out the daily radio show free with the video and audio feeds at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:06:32.703 --> 02:06:40.129]  But it is the members that are paying it forward and helping so many other people see the truth.
[02:06:40.129 --> 02:06:46.814]  And it's PrisonPlanet.tv that finances so much of the cameras, the equipment, the crew, the reporters.
[02:06:47.174 --> 02:06:52.998]  You get exclusive HD, higher quality, get it first, and then you can download it, share it with friends and family.
[02:06:52.998 --> 02:06:57.361]  It's a win-win, and then you're helping finance to put it off for free to everybody.
[02:06:57.361 --> 02:06:59.642]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:06:59.642 --> 02:07:01.303]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:07:01.303 --> 02:07:02.784]  You can't survive without it.
[02:07:02.784 --> 02:07:03.985]  But where do you get it?

[02:08:03.945 --> 02:08:05.466]  It's never gonna get any better.
[02:08:05.466 --> 02:08:06.627]  Don't look for it.
[02:08:06.627 --> 02:08:08.889]  Be happy with what you got.
[02:08:08.889 --> 02:08:12.493]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[02:08:12.493 --> 02:08:14.555]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[02:08:14.555 --> 02:08:15.676]  The real owners.
[02:08:15.676 --> 02:08:20.580]  The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:22.041]  Forget the politicians.
[02:08:22.041 --> 02:08:26.885]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[02:08:26.885 --> 02:08:27.266]  You don't.
[02:08:28.101 --> 02:08:29.462]  You have no choice.
[02:08:29.462 --> 02:08:30.683]  You have owners.
[02:08:30.683 --> 02:08:32.965]  They own you.
[02:08:32.965 --> 02:08:34.486]  They own everything.
[02:08:34.486 --> 02:08:36.487]  They own all the important land.
[02:08:36.487 --> 02:08:38.268]  They own and control the corporations.
[02:08:38.268 --> 02:08:41.751]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, the City Halls.
[02:08:41.751 --> 02:08:43.672]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[02:08:43.672 --> 02:08:48.636]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[02:08:48.636 --> 02:08:50.277]  They got you by the balls!
[02:08:51.798 --> 02:08:54.320]  They want obedient workers.
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:56.141]  Obedient workers.
[02:08:56.141 --> 02:09:08.931]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[02:09:08.931 --> 02:09:12.634]  And now, they're coming for your social security money.
[02:09:12.634 --> 02:09:16.697]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[02:09:16.697 --> 02:09:17.618]  It's a big club.
[02:09:18.607 --> 02:09:19.648]  And you ain't in it.
[02:09:19.648 --> 02:09:25.312]  You said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[02:09:25.312 --> 02:09:26.293]  You better believe it.
[02:09:26.293 --> 02:09:28.615]  So what specifically did they do?
[02:09:28.615 --> 02:09:33.979]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to, just so you understand.
[02:09:33.979 --> 02:09:35.240]  A lot of money.
[02:09:35.240 --> 02:09:38.302]  You and I are not in the big club.
[02:09:38.302 --> 02:09:40.864]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[02:09:40.864 --> 02:09:44.587]  It's called the American dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[02:09:45.987 --> 02:09:47.848]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[02:09:47.848 --> 02:09:51.371]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[02:09:51.371 --> 02:09:55.334]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[02:09:55.334 --> 02:09:56.534]  They're not interested in that.
[02:09:56.534 --> 02:09:57.855]  That doesn't help them.
[02:09:57.855 --> 02:09:59.737]  That's against their interest.
[02:09:59.737 --> 02:10:00.417]  That's right.
[02:10:00.417 --> 02:10:05.481]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:10:08.399 --> 02:10:10.884]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:10:10.884 --> 02:10:13.168]  We're now well into the third hour today.
[02:10:13.168 --> 02:10:14.971]  David Knight will be hosting the fourth hour.
[02:10:14.971 --> 02:10:16.674]  There's a key second minute report.
[02:10:16.674 --> 02:10:19.659]  They're going to premiere this nine minutes long with Jakari Jackson and more.
[02:10:21.018 --> 02:10:32.063]  We are waiting for Senator Rand Paul, who's supposed to call in the next 5-10 minutes, to get involved breaking down what's happening with the campaign, what's happening with the Audit the Fed move.
[02:10:32.063 --> 02:10:41.147]  I aired that piece with George Carlin because he's talking about the country's owners are the private European banks in 1913 that came in and took over and set this up.
[02:10:41.147 --> 02:10:49.131]  What King George couldn't do with muskets and troops and horses and cannon and ships and daggers and swords
[02:10:51.567 --> 02:11:01.935]  And so much great shotgun fire blasting out of primitive howitzers, they have done through economic subterfuge and fraud.
[02:11:01.935 --> 02:11:04.957]  And now that model is used worldwide.
[02:11:04.957 --> 02:11:07.599]  It's called globalism.
[02:11:07.599 --> 02:11:10.321]  It's a big club.
[02:11:10.321 --> 02:11:17.666]  And you ain't in it, and neither am I. And now with life extension technologies, other advancements, it's a big club.
[02:11:17.666 --> 02:11:19.528]  We're not going to be involved in that as well.
[02:11:20.475 --> 02:11:26.236]  That's the attempt to bring the world into hardcore tyranny and new forms of tyranny.
[02:11:26.236 --> 02:11:27.837]  They've said there's nothing new under the sun.
[02:11:27.837 --> 02:11:32.718]  That's an ancient saying, but there is now with MIT reporting farms all over the U.S.
[02:11:32.718 --> 02:11:38.779]  growing humans inside animals to harvest their organs.
[02:11:38.779 --> 02:11:41.300]  That was two days ago.
[02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:49.242]  And sure enough, they had a couple of newspapers write articles making fun of me about that, knowing their idiot readers don't know that I was reading under the MIT magazine.
[02:11:51.244 --> 02:11:53.606]  MIT review.
[02:11:53.606 --> 02:11:55.388]  We scroll down, I'll give you the headline.
[02:11:55.388 --> 02:12:04.938]  Human animal chimeras are gestating, you know, that means, you know, nine months in mommy, on US research farms.
[02:12:04.938 --> 02:12:13.626]  They say it's a radical new approach to generating human organs is to grow them inside pigs or sheep inside, quote, tissue clusters.
[02:12:13.626 --> 02:12:14.667]  Those are people.
[02:12:16.377 --> 02:12:17.579]  That's okay.
[02:12:17.579 --> 02:12:28.152]  The clones they grow in petri dishes are part pig, part sheep, or part cow.
[02:12:28.152 --> 02:12:29.453]  And so they don't have rights.
[02:12:31.038 --> 02:12:34.681]  Notice on all the little bottles of shampoo or whatever it says, not tested on animals.
[02:12:34.681 --> 02:12:35.542]  And I look for that.
[02:12:35.542 --> 02:12:37.003]  I don't want to test on animals.
[02:12:37.003 --> 02:12:40.165]  How about not tested on chimeras?
[02:12:40.165 --> 02:12:46.270]  Oh, there's no discussion because the whole abortion thing was about how dare the Republicans not want us to have stem cells.
[02:12:46.270 --> 02:12:50.033]  That means babies up to age nine months kept alive and their body parts sold.
[02:12:52.492 --> 02:12:55.474]  See how they twist with lawyer crap everything?
[02:12:55.474 --> 02:13:00.278]  And I'm just here exposing, oh I'm sorry I said the word crap.
[02:13:00.278 --> 02:13:06.643]  I really try to not use uncouth language, but I get so real these days I can't help it.
[02:13:06.643 --> 02:13:14.789]  Plus, what they say in famous movie that I quote so often, Apocalypse Now with Marlon Brando.
[02:13:18.277 --> 02:13:30.916]  Colonel Kurtz is saying, you know, we court-martial our pilots for writing the F-word on their airplanes, but then we have them drop fire on villages of children.
[02:13:30.916 --> 02:13:31.817]  And what's he saying there?
[02:13:31.817 --> 02:13:33.880]  There's that hypocrisy.
[02:13:35.265 --> 02:13:43.191]  But I know our audience aren't hypocrites, but I tell you, I'm a family man, and we should be dignified with these lofty subjects we're covering.
[02:13:43.191 --> 02:13:55.160]  But at the same time, once you get down in a guttural, on-the-ground battle with tyranny, it just strips away any pretense, and I just get to the point where I'm a slave to the truth.
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:14:01.165]  It's a good slavery, but I just can't hold back anymore.
[02:14:04.639 --> 02:14:05.099]  Report!
[02:14:05.099 --> 02:14:08.922]  White House is blocking investigation into over 100 terrorists inside the U.S.
[02:14:08.922 --> 02:14:10.563]  Steve Watson, InfoWars.com.
[02:14:10.563 --> 02:14:11.804]  It's a huge story.
[02:14:11.804 --> 02:14:14.225]  This is from the federal government.
[02:14:14.225 --> 02:14:24.972]  Major bank warns of oil prices could fall to $10 a barrel, but other major bank groups say war between Saudi Arabia and Iran could send oil prices to $250 a barrel, and so you'd be paying $5, $6 at the pump.
[02:14:27.856 --> 02:14:38.859]  Yeah, that's the word from big oil company insiders and others, is that, oh, you enjoy this whole oil war where they're trying to bankrupt fracking and bankrupt the oil sands, the tar sands, and bankrupt Russia.
[02:14:38.859 --> 02:14:40.820]  They want to bankrupt North America and Russia.
[02:14:40.820 --> 02:14:51.463]  But when they're done, when they've bankrupted those wildcatters that became pretty big-sized companies, you know, billion-dollar companies, a lot of small companies became billion-dollar.
[02:14:51.463 --> 02:14:54.044]  They started, you know, four or five guys wildcatting, getting their first well.
[02:14:55.151 --> 02:14:57.993]  Taking them a decade, two decades to build, build, build.
[02:14:57.993 --> 02:14:59.815]  Get hundreds of wells, thousands of wells.
[02:14:59.815 --> 02:15:02.076]  Build their own pipelines, their own refineries.
[02:15:02.076 --> 02:15:02.397]  Boom!
[02:15:02.397 --> 02:15:03.417]  Drop down prices.
[02:15:03.417 --> 02:15:04.518]  Uh-uh!
[02:15:04.518 --> 02:15:07.080]  We're going to drop prices for five years until everything's bankrupt.
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:14.626]  And then, baby, we can do whatever we want.
[02:15:14.626 --> 02:15:15.987]  Pretty big deal.
[02:15:15.987 --> 02:15:18.309]  And of course, you know the oil companies finance bankrupting coal.
[02:15:19.397 --> 02:15:27.663]  You know, if I thought like the average yuppie weasel, I run into them in Texas, a lot of them, a lot of them are nice people, a lot of them are bad folks, but, you know, a lot of them are worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:15:27.663 --> 02:15:34.208]  There's a bunch of people like that that own big ranches with huge oil wells and, you know, stuff all over them.
[02:15:34.208 --> 02:15:38.772]  And they'll sit around and laugh going, oh, whatever, I don't care if they bankrupt coal, I'm going to make more money.
[02:15:38.772 --> 02:15:46.338]  And I sit there and I go, but my family has some oil and gas that's in direct
[02:15:47.990 --> 02:15:54.779]  I don't have any coal in my family, but I wouldn't want to bankrupt coal so I made more money.
[02:15:54.779 --> 02:15:57.062]  It's just so immoral.
[02:15:57.062 --> 02:15:58.884]  And it destroys capitalism.
[02:15:58.884 --> 02:15:59.625]  And that's what's wrong.
[02:16:00.663 --> 02:16:08.387]  We need to audit the private run for private Federal Reserve, and no one has championed that more than former Congressman Dr. Ron Paul.
[02:16:08.387 --> 02:16:13.809]  And now, for the last five years, no one has championed that more in the U.S.
[02:16:13.809 --> 02:16:16.371]  Senate than Senator Rand Paul.
[02:16:16.371 --> 02:16:21.033]  And that's why I've been very hopeful when he was the leader of the campaign, of the Republican run,
[02:16:22.247 --> 02:16:24.289]  To get the nomination, that he would stay in the lead.
[02:16:24.289 --> 02:16:26.471]  But he's been in the lead, he could go back in the lead.
[02:16:26.471 --> 02:16:27.512]  We've seen that.
[02:16:27.512 --> 02:16:36.821]  The media's trying to say that Rand Paul is out of the race, and then they put John Kasich in the Republican debate coming up tomorrow night that we're going to be covering live.
[02:16:36.821 --> 02:16:39.263]  It's crazy!
[02:16:39.263 --> 02:16:42.646]  So, definitely the fix is in, but can we override that fix?
[02:16:42.646 --> 02:16:44.128]  I know he didn't come on about this.
[02:16:44.128 --> 02:16:47.331]  He wanted to come on about auditing the Fed, which we're very close to doing.
[02:16:49.315 --> 02:16:52.298]  Really, it's 1776 Part 2, but peaceful.
[02:16:52.298 --> 02:16:55.060]  But I do want to get into campaign 2016 with him.
[02:16:55.060 --> 02:16:56.722]  RandPaul.com.
[02:16:56.722 --> 02:16:59.464]  Senator, thanks for coming on with us again.
[02:16:59.464 --> 02:17:00.005]  Hey, Alex.
[02:17:00.005 --> 02:17:01.226]  Thanks for having us.
[02:17:01.226 --> 02:17:02.467]  There is so much going on.
[02:17:02.467 --> 02:17:05.170]  We've only got you for about 10 minutes, so you've got the floor.
[02:17:05.170 --> 02:17:06.691]  What's the battle plan to audit the Fed?
[02:17:06.691 --> 02:17:08.533]  What's happening in the campaign?
[02:17:08.533 --> 02:17:09.954]  How do we get you back in the debates?
[02:17:09.954 --> 02:17:10.815]  Where is all this going?
[02:17:11.829 --> 02:17:14.311]  The good news is, you know, we got a majority yesterday.
[02:17:14.311 --> 02:17:19.415]  We got 53 votes for auditing the Fed, and we needed 60, unfortunately.
[02:17:19.415 --> 02:17:21.696]  We were missing Ted Cruz, unfortunately.
[02:17:21.696 --> 02:17:23.718]  He couldn't come back to vote with us.
[02:17:23.718 --> 02:17:26.700]  But we did get a majority, and I think that's a step forward.
[02:17:26.700 --> 02:17:29.682]  It took me five years to get a vote on the bill.
[02:17:29.682 --> 02:17:32.024]  I talked to Harry Reid until I was blue in the face.
[02:17:32.024 --> 02:17:36.808]  I reminded him that he used to be for auditing the Fed, but no longer.
[02:17:36.808 --> 02:17:38.129]  And we finally got a vote.
[02:17:39.289 --> 02:17:44.050]  Two Democrats, Baldwin, and then we got Bernie Sanders to vote for it as well.
[02:17:44.050 --> 02:17:46.891]  So, we got close, but we didn't quite get there.
[02:17:46.891 --> 02:17:48.672]  But to me, it's a long fight.
[02:17:48.672 --> 02:17:50.312]  It's long overdue.
[02:17:50.312 --> 02:17:55.294]  The Federal Reserve really is responsible for a lot of the income inequality in our country.
[02:17:55.294 --> 02:17:59.295]  The rich get richer because the Federal Reserve passes their money out to the rich.
[02:17:59.295 --> 02:18:07.237]  By the time it filters down to the rest of us, prices are going up and we never really seem to see any value in the new money that is put into the system.
[02:18:08.968 --> 02:18:11.849]  I also noticed mainstream media really tries to not cover this.
[02:18:11.849 --> 02:18:19.092]  This is a big deal when you have the former Fed Chairman Greenspan, as you know, on Laird NewsHour saying, we're above the law, Congress can't even look at us.
[02:18:19.092 --> 02:18:25.495]  Since when is a private group masquerading as government above the law when Congress has the power to issue the currency, Senator?
[02:18:25.495 --> 02:18:27.936]  Because, I mean, I cannot praise you and others enough.
[02:18:28.576 --> 02:18:37.833]  Especially you for leading the fight all the way to the fact that you've almost been able to overturn it, but they want this, I guess, 60 votes, but you've gotten 50-plus.
[02:18:37.833 --> 02:18:41.539]  I mean, this is amazing after your father's 30-plus year battle to do this.
[02:18:43.004 --> 02:18:52.091]  The biggest lobby against auditing the Fed is actually coming from the Federal Reserve, and this has made me so mad that the government created the Federal Reserve.
[02:18:52.091 --> 02:18:55.854]  Sure, they're quasi-private, but they were created by the government.
[02:18:55.854 --> 02:19:02.579]  It's a conglomeration of private banks, but they should not be allowed to lobby against their own oversight.
[02:19:02.579 --> 02:19:11.966]  So they come to Washington, they write op-eds, they called every senator in advance and lobbied them to say, we don't want more oversight.
[02:19:11.966 --> 02:19:12.667]  It'll somehow
[02:19:13.127 --> 02:19:15.450]  You know, affect our policymaking.
[02:19:15.450 --> 02:19:17.512]  Well, we need to ask questions.
[02:19:17.512 --> 02:19:25.621]  Did their policymaking lead to this huge, enormous recession that we got with a real estate crisis and where a lot of people caught up in it?
[02:19:25.621 --> 02:19:32.588]  And how come when we got caught up in it, the poor people suffered, but the people on Wall Street just went right along merrily making $100 million a year?
[02:19:34.490 --> 02:19:36.591]  And they bankrupted AIG.
[02:19:36.591 --> 02:19:40.571]  You saw the other day who the former head of AIG is giving their money to, right?
[02:19:40.571 --> 02:19:45.113]  He took $10 million of his bailout money to try to bail out the Bush campaign.
[02:19:45.113 --> 02:19:46.493]  So it goes on and on.
[02:19:46.493 --> 02:19:54.535]  The rich get richer, but the government should not be showing this crony capitalism through the banking system.
[02:19:54.535 --> 02:19:55.915]  And I'm going to keep up the fight.
[02:19:55.915 --> 02:19:59.456]  If it takes me another five years, I'm going to get a vote on Audit the Fed and we're going to win.
[02:20:00.596 --> 02:20:14.881]  Well, I have said probably a thousand times the last few years that even before the campaign started, I appreciate you running for president, just like I appreciate you running for Senate, and I appreciate the fact you've been true to your principles and not compromised, even though they've demonized you.
[02:20:14.881 --> 02:20:20.763]  But now, I have not been critical, but I mean, I know you're a gentleman, your dad's a gentleman.
[02:20:21.789 --> 02:20:28.952]  The fact is, people are angry, there's an insurrection, a lot of America isn't as sophisticated as some of the libertarians.
[02:20:28.952 --> 02:20:31.594]  I think you can beat Trump if you
[02:20:33.061 --> 02:20:43.052]  Really get aggressive, and I'm not saying stoop to that level, but of the WWE, which obviously he's been part of, but he knows what he's doing.
[02:20:43.052 --> 02:20:44.554]  That's what people want.
[02:20:44.554 --> 02:20:47.898]  And all I'm saying is, I know you'd make the best president of the three people.
[02:20:47.898 --> 02:20:49.620]  I mean, I like Ted Cruz.
[02:20:49.620 --> 02:20:50.901]  I like Trump as well.
[02:20:50.901 --> 02:20:53.564]  I know your pedigree, your history, no compromise.
[02:20:53.564 --> 02:20:54.185]  You're for real.
[02:20:54.825 --> 02:20:58.307]  Trump, I don't really know, but I mean, I'd rather him than Hillary.
[02:20:58.307 --> 02:21:00.227]  How do we get you elected president?
[02:21:00.227 --> 02:21:07.110]  I know there's a lot of time left, and folks thought Trump would fade, but I think, you know, really getting aggressive is the way to go.
[02:21:07.110 --> 02:21:11.612]  I don't plan to be the big political guru here, sir, but I mean, I'd really like to see you as president.
[02:21:12.932 --> 02:21:22.138]  You know, the thing we keep trying to point out is that Trump has no history as a person who believes in limited government or as really even being a conservative.
[02:21:22.138 --> 02:21:28.463]  One of the things that I think is the bedrock principle of capitalism and a free society is ownership of property.
[02:21:28.463 --> 02:21:31.345]  When you own your house, the government shouldn't come in your house.
[02:21:31.345 --> 02:21:35.488]  The government has no right to your property and you have the right to control your property.
[02:21:36.048 --> 02:21:42.035]  But you know, one of the ways Trump has made money, and he's said this repeatedly, is that he believes in eminent domain.
[02:21:42.035 --> 02:21:47.081]  He believes the government should be allowed to take private property and give it to another private property owner.
[02:21:47.081 --> 02:21:54.550]  This was a famous Supreme Court decision, the Kelo decision, and I think it's inconsistent with someone who believes in limited government.
[02:21:55.090 --> 02:21:57.032]  And he's used it repeatedly.
[02:21:57.032 --> 02:21:59.774]  Vera Coakley lived in her house for 30 years.
[02:21:59.774 --> 02:22:03.837]  Donald Trump took it for a parking lot for one of his casinos where he tried.
[02:22:03.837 --> 02:22:06.558]  She battled him in court and she actually beat him.
[02:22:06.558 --> 02:22:10.641]  But I think there really is no limited government tradition with Trump.
[02:22:10.641 --> 02:22:13.664]  And I think when he says, trust me, give me power, I'll
[02:22:14.684 --> 02:22:16.765]  You know, I'll be strong, I'll do things better.
[02:22:16.765 --> 02:22:30.413]  I worry about that because most of the tradition, not only English tradition, but American tradition, has been trying to limit the power of the monarch, limit the power of the presidency, and it's not give me more power, I'm smart and I'll fix it.
[02:22:30.413 --> 02:22:33.515]  It's leave the power with the states and the people and leave me alone.
[02:22:33.515 --> 02:22:35.817]  And I don't think he's part of that tradition.
[02:22:35.817 --> 02:22:43.121]  But he is angry and people have, you know, fallen in for the anger without examining whether or not he would make government bigger or smaller.
[02:22:43.802 --> 02:22:46.629]  Well, I know you have so much integrity that you won't...
[02:22:47.523 --> 02:22:51.125]  Get, you know, professional wrestler on folks to win.
[02:22:51.125 --> 02:22:53.927]  But at the same time, I know you have integrity.
[02:22:53.927 --> 02:22:54.768]  I mean, I've watched you.
[02:22:54.768 --> 02:22:57.750]  I've known you for 20 years when you were campaigning for your dad.
[02:22:57.750 --> 02:22:59.711]  And I know you've never compromised.
[02:22:59.711 --> 02:23:05.695]  I know you exposed that Al Qaeda was being Western funded before Cruz or Trump did it, you know, years before.
[02:23:05.695 --> 02:23:15.601]  I know you've led the fight on the Fed, led the fight to defund, you know, all these different organizations like Planned Parenthood and, you know, defund the foreign aid of these radical Islamists.
[02:23:15.601 --> 02:23:16.622]  I mean, I know, sir, that
[02:23:17.242 --> 02:23:17.843]  You know what?
[02:23:34.844 --> 02:23:36.266]  You're doing a great job overall.
[02:23:36.266 --> 02:23:45.899]  I just wonder, sitting here, how we can catapult you back to the lead when clearly the establishment is doing everything they can to try to sideline you.
[02:23:45.899 --> 02:23:49.183]  I mean, look, you clearly have more support than John Kasich.
[02:23:49.183 --> 02:23:50.425]  Clearly you should be in the debate.
[02:23:50.845 --> 02:23:56.430]  So you're probably doing the right thing to not be in the debate so that you can at least make a big deal out of it and actually be heard.
[02:23:56.430 --> 02:24:04.137]  What else can you do, can we do, to try to get you back in there to win this nomination or to inject good ideas?
[02:24:04.137 --> 02:24:08.762]  Because, you know, Trump could do some faux pas, fall out, and then we get Jeb Bush, God forbid.
[02:24:09.738 --> 02:24:32.687]  You know, I think one of the things about the disconnect between the grassroots and, you know, the establishment Washington Republicans is, I put forward an amendment about a year or so ago and I said that we shouldn't give any foreign aid to any countries that persecute Christians, any countries that put to death Christians who interfaith marriage or people who convert from Islam to Christianity.
[02:24:32.687 --> 02:24:36.669]  If they have laws on their books that says you are put to death, they shouldn't get any of our money.
[02:24:37.089 --> 02:24:43.111]  I've yet to meet one American outside of Washington who is opposed to my amendment.
[02:24:43.111 --> 02:24:53.474]  And yet in Washington, when we voted on it, 18 senators voted to continue sending foreign aid, even if the laws of the country we were giving the money to were to persecute Christians.
[02:24:53.474 --> 02:24:58.756]  And so that, I think, just shows you how far apart we are, the grassroots from those in Washington.
[02:24:58.756 --> 02:25:01.657]  And one of the things I'm pushing, and going to continue to push,
[02:25:02.177 --> 02:25:02.777]  Is it really?
[02:25:02.777 --> 02:25:04.438]  I think we ought to have term limits.
[02:25:04.438 --> 02:25:09.741]  I think that we need more, you know, we need more revolving in and out of office.
[02:25:09.741 --> 02:25:12.543]  We need more citizen politicians up there.
[02:25:12.543 --> 02:25:16.425]  And I've become more and more convinced that the people up there are never going to fix it.
[02:25:16.425 --> 02:25:21.728]  So a house cleaning periodically is something we're going to have to do if we ever have hope of fixing things.
[02:25:22.028 --> 02:25:26.390]  Well, in the few minutes we have left, RandPaul.com, you've got fundraisers going.
[02:25:26.390 --> 02:25:45.057]  Regardless, folks, you need to back Rand Paul to inject anti-globalism, pro-Americana, Audit the Fed, pro-Second Amendment narratives into the debate, just like your father running, built the libertarian movement that's now been able to get a major faction of the Republicans as hopefully a check on what's happening.
[02:25:45.057 --> 02:25:50.119]  So this is a long war made up of battles, but how do we help you, A, Audit the Fed,
[02:25:51.039 --> 02:25:59.201]  And then separately, I'll say it again, you have been, it's just true, the leader when it comes to doing filibusters that others then imitate, which is great.
[02:25:59.201 --> 02:26:02.502]  When it comes to opposing the TPP, which is great.
[02:26:02.502 --> 02:26:16.085]  And so I do, you know, really just want to thank you for the fact that you really have taken the true constitutional stance at the expense of media demonization campaigns.
[02:26:16.085 --> 02:26:19.826]  So that proves you'd be the best guy for president, the fact that you've engaged in real leadership.
[02:26:20.819 --> 02:26:30.802]  I think the biggest thing that people need to remember is that when we are attacked, when there are terrorist attacks, is not to be fearful because then terrorists win.
[02:26:30.802 --> 02:26:40.165]  When you're fearful, when we give up on our liberties, when we say, oh, we're going to trade our liberty for a false sense of security, that's when we lose and that's when terrorism wins.
[02:26:40.165 --> 02:26:45.167]  Right now, the biggest clamor in Washington, led by Marco Rubio, led by McCain and others,
[02:26:45.738 --> 02:26:53.283]  Is to get the government collecting all of our phone records, all of our credit card statements, because they say, oh, we need more information.
[02:26:53.283 --> 02:26:54.584]  That's coming from the right.
[02:26:54.584 --> 02:26:58.527]  On the left, you have President Obama saying, we just need gun control.
[02:26:58.527 --> 02:27:03.750]  The problem is, is they're both succumbing to the fear that the terrorists are trying to invoke upon us.
[02:27:03.750 --> 02:27:06.812]  So the left wants to give up and get gun control.
[02:27:06.812 --> 02:27:11.956]  The right wants to give up and allow people control and control of our records and invasion of our houses by the government.
[02:27:12.456 --> 02:27:16.399]  So, by all means, don't let fear influence this thing.
[02:27:16.399 --> 02:27:25.907]  Stand strong, and I know your listeners will step up and say, you know, we have to be very, very careful of allowing more power to gravitate to Washington.
[02:27:25.907 --> 02:27:29.469]  The power needs to go back to the states, and it needs to go back to the people.
[02:27:29.469 --> 02:27:31.811]  I want to put a question in here for you.
[02:27:33.052 --> 02:27:36.855]  You are the guy that exposed that the West was funding Al-Qaeda and then ISIS.
[02:27:36.855 --> 02:27:37.796]  That's on record.
[02:27:37.796 --> 02:27:38.537]  It's now been admitted.
[02:27:38.537 --> 02:27:39.398]  You've been vindicated.
[02:27:39.398 --> 02:27:43.742]  That was daring three years ago, four years ago to expose that.
[02:27:43.742 --> 02:27:52.509]  Now they are running these clips of Obama from the State of the Union last night, and I don't want to get your take on this, where he says they will be punished, we're going after them.
[02:27:52.509 --> 02:27:58.795]  To see the guy that funded these rebels and Hillary that did this, now taking credit for fighting them.
[02:27:58.795 --> 02:27:59.896]  Sir, what's your view on that?
[02:28:01.206 --> 02:28:04.088]  You know, I think we're starting to get some of the real truth out there.
[02:28:04.088 --> 02:28:16.016]  You know, in the last presidential debate, I put forward the proposition that regime change in Syria, regime change in Libya, it actually isn't making us safer, it's actually putting us more at risk.
[02:28:16.016 --> 02:28:19.819]  And this is an interesting debate, because on one side you have Hillary Clinton,
[02:28:20.419 --> 02:28:27.964]  You've got the President, you've got Rubio, you've got McCain, you've got all these people who want regime change in Libya, but we're actually less safe.
[02:28:27.964 --> 02:28:29.845]  It's a failed state now.
[02:28:29.845 --> 02:28:32.827]  A third of Libya pledges allegiance to ISIS.
[02:28:32.827 --> 02:28:38.111]  And so, I think we are, for the first time in a long time, actually having a public debate over that.
[02:28:38.111 --> 02:28:44.595]  And that's why it's important that I'm in the presidential debates and that we are given a chance to compete for the presidency.
[02:28:44.595 --> 02:28:46.196]  We still think there's a chance today.
[02:28:46.196 --> 02:28:48.898]  There was a brand new poll that came out in the Iowa
[02:28:49.478 --> 02:28:52.262]  What does my audience do to get you in that debate, Senator?
[02:29:05.748 --> 02:29:17.061]  You know, I think the best thing would be to call the Republican National Committee and tell Reince Priebus that they need to allow all voices to be heard in the debate and that it's not fair to exclude me from the debate.
[02:29:17.061 --> 02:29:20.065]  We're going to get that number and bring it up after the break.
[02:29:20.065 --> 02:29:21.266]  You're leaving us now.
[02:29:21.266 --> 02:29:22.388]  RandPaul.com.
[02:29:22.388 --> 02:29:24.851]  Are there any other websites folks should go to for support?
[02:29:25.698 --> 02:29:40.980]  mainly ran paul.com or if they want to go to our facebook and we've got lots of information out there tells where i'm going to be people want to make phone calls for us they can make phone calls for us in iowa people want to donate they can donate people want to fly up to our new hampshire we got a spot for them
[02:29:41.621 --> 02:29:46.328]  And, uh, it's amazing to see all the young people and how exciting it is in Iowa right now.
[02:29:46.328 --> 02:29:47.069]  It's incredible.
[02:29:47.069 --> 02:29:48.451]  Senator Paul, thank you so much.
[02:29:48.451 --> 02:29:49.152]  Good to talk to you.
[02:29:49.152 --> 02:29:49.513]  Godspeed.
[02:30:00.342 --> 02:30:07.284]  Obama is removing obstacles for driverless cars, pushing back against state regulation, clearing the road for Google.
[02:30:07.284 --> 02:30:18.247]  After Google cars were involved in 11 accidents in six years, the California DMV proposed new state regulations to require a human, a steering wheel, throttle and brake pedals on California roads.
[02:30:18.747 --> 02:30:20.127]  Can't have that, Obama says.
[02:30:20.127 --> 02:30:23.168]  Can't have a patchwork of state regulations for robot cars.
[02:30:23.168 --> 02:30:29.069]  Google Car's accident rate would work out to 83 accidents over 45 years of driving.
[02:30:29.069 --> 02:30:32.950]  How many humans do you know that have had 83 accidents?
[02:30:32.950 --> 02:30:34.691]  Would you get in their car?
[02:30:34.691 --> 02:30:35.571]  But don't worry.
[02:30:35.571 --> 02:30:37.251]  Obama's just offering you a choice.
[02:30:37.251 --> 02:30:42.232]  Your own personal limo where you can just play on social media and leave the driving to them.
[02:30:42.232 --> 02:30:44.333]  Like Obamacare, with Obama Car,
[02:30:44.733 --> 02:30:47.576]  If you like your car, you can keep your car.
[02:30:47.576 --> 02:30:50.840]  You just won't be able to afford the insurance to drive your own car.
[02:30:50.840 --> 02:30:53.403]  Because, you know, Obama cars are safer than you.
[02:30:53.403 --> 02:30:54.764]  Right.
[02:30:54.764 --> 02:30:55.746]  83 accidents.
[02:30:55.746 --> 02:30:56.827]  Not my fault.

[02:33:08.206 --> 02:33:27.799]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.799 --> 02:33:30.521]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[02:33:30.521 --> 02:33:30.961]  to 3 p.m.
[02:33:30.961 --> 02:33:34.464]  We're live.
[02:33:39.576 --> 02:33:45.319]  Broadcasting across the planet.
[02:33:45.319 --> 02:33:59.427]  And we are here opposing the worldwide Luciferian conspiracy.
[02:33:59.427 --> 02:34:02.749]  And the God of this world wants to play God, but is no God at all.
[02:34:04.508 --> 02:34:06.269]  I want to open the phones up.
[02:34:06.269 --> 02:34:08.569]  I've got so much news here it makes my head spin.
[02:34:08.569 --> 02:34:11.591]  I've got so many video clips to play it makes my head spin.
[02:34:11.591 --> 02:34:20.494]  But I want to open the phones up specifically on what you think about Rand Paul and what you think about Donald Trump.
[02:34:20.494 --> 02:34:32.038]  Because I really care about the polls and Ron Paul has done more than probably anybody else with his focus to expose the globalists in this country in my lifetime and probably around the world.
[02:34:33.317 --> 02:34:53.247]  And the Senator's done a great job up there, and then I feel mad when I complain that he's not being aggressive enough in his rhetoric, but then I feel guilty when I was actually interviewing him, thinking about all the things he's actually done and the trolls they've put out lying about him, like saying he supported TPP, which he didn't.
[02:34:53.247 --> 02:34:57.309]  He said, I support free trade, but none of it's secret, and this isn't free trade.
[02:34:57.309 --> 02:34:58.210]  See, they play those games.
[02:35:00.913 --> 02:35:04.615]  But imagine a Ted Cruz, Rand Paul presidency.
[02:35:04.615 --> 02:35:06.015]  Either way.
[02:35:06.015 --> 02:35:07.536]  One or the other president, vice president.
[02:35:07.536 --> 02:35:15.100]  800-259-9231 800-259-9231 I support whoever I believe can win.
[02:35:26.471 --> 02:35:31.034]  And turn our free market system back on again, and leave our guns alone.
[02:35:31.034 --> 02:35:32.795]  And not engage in medical tyranny.
[02:35:32.795 --> 02:35:39.639]  I like Carson, but he says he's for forced inoculation.
[02:35:39.639 --> 02:35:43.682]  Trump, you know, says, I'm against all these wars, you don't believe how militaristic I am.
[02:35:45.734 --> 02:35:49.660]  So I'm like, okay, you're against these wars, I like that, but you say you're militaristic, that's kind of scary.
[02:35:49.660 --> 02:35:52.765]  You say, oh don't worry, I'll spy on them so much we'll get the terrorists.
[02:35:52.765 --> 02:35:56.070]  They don't let them spy on the foreign assets, they spy on us.
[02:35:56.070 --> 02:35:57.052]  I've had the top people on.
[02:35:59.687 --> 02:36:01.829]  But 95% of what Trump says is really great.
[02:36:01.829 --> 02:36:06.534]  And you know, we've got tyrants on white horses under Obama and Hillary.
[02:36:06.534 --> 02:36:14.283]  I mean, we know there is bona fide bad, want to destroy us, mount our head on the wall, conquer us as we've ever seen.
[02:36:14.283 --> 02:36:15.324]  So am I a gambler?
[02:36:15.324 --> 02:36:21.190]  No, but Trump's looking really good right now because he's in the lead.
[02:36:22.833 --> 02:36:25.035]  He's destroying political correctness.
[02:36:25.035 --> 02:36:26.516]  He doesn't want our borders open.
[02:36:26.516 --> 02:36:27.877]  He's being demonized.
[02:36:27.877 --> 02:36:29.558]  And both parties are after him.
[02:36:29.558 --> 02:36:31.119]  That's a certification right there.
[02:36:31.119 --> 02:36:32.040]  Has he got some problems?
[02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:37.704]  You bet.
[02:36:37.704 --> 02:36:41.347]  Paul has less problems politically and being a patriot.
[02:36:41.347 --> 02:36:46.571]  I mean, he's, he's, he's, his dad's like a hundred percent right on with what I agree with.
[02:36:46.571 --> 02:36:47.011]  Rand's like 95.
[02:36:49.946 --> 02:36:55.691]  Trump's like 90%, 85%, whatever, but the rhetoric's better, the leadership is stronger.
[02:36:55.691 --> 02:37:03.419]  We need an arrogance in the face of these arrogant socialists and globalists, right as they're ready to be kicked over like a rotting facade full of termites.
[02:37:03.419 --> 02:37:06.241]  I mean, they really are a facade.
[02:37:06.241 --> 02:37:13.789]  And what's happening with this show exploding, and people recognizing it, is not some power trip for me, because let me tell you,
[02:37:14.784 --> 02:37:18.725]  You want to walk point in a major counter-offensive against the globalists?
[02:37:18.725 --> 02:37:19.585]  Oh, you're awake!
[02:37:19.585 --> 02:37:20.505]  It's not boring!
[02:37:20.505 --> 02:37:32.388]  I wouldn't not do this for anything, but because I'm committed, and because I'm not a coward, and because I want to fight tyranny, and I don't like enslavement.
[02:37:32.388 --> 02:37:40.430]  Not because I want to be the big, swinging, jolly green giant of the liberty movement.
[02:37:40.430 --> 02:37:41.930]  Not because I got something to prove.
[02:37:43.601 --> 02:37:44.762]  I know where this road leads.
[02:37:44.762 --> 02:37:51.227]  I can't take my family there.
[02:37:51.227 --> 02:37:55.690]  So I don't endorse people or support them because they pat me on the head.
[02:37:58.342 --> 02:38:17.553]  Because they come on my show, our ratings go up some with a Rand Paul or a Donald Trump on, but what people really listen to is just us talking about the news and humanity and the Second Amendment and what's happening and the guest we have, the analyst on the economy and all the other big things.
[02:38:17.553 --> 02:38:19.234]  But the system's got a problem.
[02:38:19.234 --> 02:38:24.497]  The world government they want is finally arriving and people don't like it.
[02:38:25.478 --> 02:38:33.662]  And it smells, and it stinks, and it's ugly, and it's pathetic, and it's bad, and it's unfair, and it's ridiculous.
[02:38:33.662 --> 02:38:38.704]  And now you rule this pile of crud because you're dishonorable.
[02:38:38.704 --> 02:38:44.247]  And our decadence allowed the elites to take over.
[02:38:44.247 --> 02:38:47.528]  So we really do have to look in the mirror.
[02:38:47.528 --> 02:38:49.789]  That was my big awakening in the last five, six years.
[02:38:49.789 --> 02:38:52.511]  I mean, I've been awake for 25 years, politically aware for 30.
[02:38:54.707 --> 02:38:59.771]  Or close to it.
[02:38:59.771 --> 02:39:03.554]  Was when I started realizing why do I just hate some bureaucrat?
[02:39:03.554 --> 02:39:05.576]  Why do I get angry at some cop?
[02:39:07.244 --> 02:39:15.869]  When they're just brainwashed, mindlessly following some program, shouldn't I be mad at myself that I'm not a great enough man to change the world?
[02:39:15.869 --> 02:39:29.756]  That I'm not a great enough person, when my forebears were, to reach out to people in common cause and common honor and common association?
[02:39:29.756 --> 02:39:32.538]  Because when we look at the world and it's wrong and we're getting screwed over,
[02:39:35.683 --> 02:39:39.646]  It's because we failed as a people.
[02:39:39.646 --> 02:39:41.908]  And that doesn't mean we blame ourselves more than them.
[02:39:41.908 --> 02:39:51.856]  Oh, they get the lion's share of the blame, and they will be held accountable, to quote V from Vendetta.
[02:39:51.856 --> 02:39:55.019]  But in the end, if you want to know who's to blame, just look in the mirror.
[02:39:57.489 --> 02:40:18.622]  And with my children, and my life, and my health, and everything I do, the greatest part of what I've done in my life, and what I know can heal others as well, just from my own personal experience, is not blaming other people for things that squarely lie in your own camp.
[02:40:18.622 --> 02:40:20.524]  I actually like genuine criticism.
[02:40:20.524 --> 02:40:22.145]  I really appreciate it.
[02:40:22.145 --> 02:40:22.565]  I want it.
[02:40:24.184 --> 02:40:26.305]  I want to be reproved.
[02:40:26.305 --> 02:40:27.585]  I want to be edified.
[02:40:27.585 --> 02:40:30.326]  I want to be rebuked.
[02:40:30.326 --> 02:40:32.526]  It's like that caller that time called.
[02:40:32.526 --> 02:40:37.748]  He was telling me where I was wrong about denying Christ.
[02:40:37.748 --> 02:40:46.890]  And all I was saying was, man, if these radical jihadis are putting a gun to your head and say, deny Christ, you know, when they attack these colleges and stuff, they successfully covered up the whole Oregon thing.
[02:40:48.365 --> 02:40:50.206]  Not to San Bernardino.
[02:40:50.206 --> 02:40:50.606]  I don't know.
[02:40:50.606 --> 02:40:52.126]  I got kids to go home to at night.
[02:40:52.126 --> 02:40:56.288]  I'm just not going to be a liar on air like I'm this super guy.
[02:40:56.288 --> 02:41:01.950]  It's not that I'm a coward, but if I can get out of dying by telling some scumbag a lie, I'll lie.
[02:41:01.950 --> 02:41:03.531]  And I said, is that moral?
[02:41:03.531 --> 02:41:11.634]  Because I won't lie up here on the big platform, but at the moment I'm not in front of everybody and they're going to win if I don't.
[02:41:13.959 --> 02:41:15.982]  Lie to him, then I'd lie to him.
[02:41:15.982 --> 02:41:20.349]  And he called in and read me all the verses about, no, if you'll deny me before men, I'll deny you before my father.
[02:41:20.349 --> 02:41:23.073]  And I didn't realize that, no, it's true.
[02:41:23.073 --> 02:41:24.375]  You can't even do that.
[02:41:24.375 --> 02:41:25.357]  You can't even lie.
[02:41:27.898 --> 02:41:28.558]  Period.
[02:41:28.558 --> 02:41:29.878]  I mean, he was right.
[02:41:29.878 --> 02:41:36.160]  It was good to be... But at the same time, well, then how do I sneak into Bohemian Grove and tell them I'm a member to be able to cover what they're doing there?
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:39.600]  I mean, the Bible's got spies going into different cities and lying to folks.
[02:41:39.600 --> 02:41:41.841]  I mean, there's a time to do that.
[02:41:41.841 --> 02:41:48.402]  But a person who's good has to have that debate with themselves, not just say, I'm good and I'm just going to lie whenever I want.
[02:41:48.402 --> 02:41:49.422]  Because let me tell you something.
[02:41:49.422 --> 02:41:52.903]  To quote Tony Montana, I tell the truth even when I lie.
[02:41:55.882 --> 02:41:57.884]  The lie is not in me.
[02:41:57.884 --> 02:42:05.110]  And I realize people that lie, they create false paradigms of lies.
[02:42:05.110 --> 02:42:08.112]  I was talking about this with my mother last night at dinner.
[02:42:08.112 --> 02:42:09.894]  She came over to the house.
[02:42:09.894 --> 02:42:13.617]  My dad with the kids were playing ping pong and ate roasted chicken and stuff.
[02:42:13.617 --> 02:42:16.479]  It was good, but I don't want to go off into that.
[02:42:16.479 --> 02:42:18.321]  I just image everything I talk about and then I'm going to your calls.
[02:42:22.403 --> 02:42:25.564]  And she said, you know, really what serving evil is, is about lies.
[02:42:25.564 --> 02:42:30.625]  And she goes, I don't mean lying and saying some food's good or a dress looks good on your wife or whatever.
[02:42:30.625 --> 02:42:38.207]  But she said, building a lie, a whole world of lies that you then want others to buy into, false reality.
[02:42:38.207 --> 02:42:39.288]  That's what the devil is.
[02:42:39.288 --> 02:42:40.608]  And I said, you're absolutely right.
[02:42:40.608 --> 02:42:42.389]  That's a very astute point you've made.
[02:42:42.389 --> 02:42:48.310]  I'm glad you boiled that down for me.
[02:42:48.310 --> 02:42:50.631]  But I lie less than anyone I know.
[02:43:00.188 --> 02:43:06.093]  I love how the liars say they never lied.
[02:43:06.093 --> 02:43:13.398]  But you know the best propaganda, as Obama knows, Joseph Goebbels taught him, is just an outrageous, stupid one.
[02:43:13.398 --> 02:43:16.901]  It's so over the top, you're like taken back by it.
[02:43:16.901 --> 02:43:20.143]  And, and, and people want to believe it.
[02:43:20.143 --> 02:43:23.126]  I'm going to go to your calls right now, Everett.
[02:43:24.127 --> 02:43:27.389]  Maya, Kimberly, Jason, Antoine, and others.
[02:43:27.389 --> 02:43:28.510]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[02:43:28.510 --> 02:43:39.558]  And just briefly, because I'm not going to belabor this, we need funds to continue the operation and hopefully expand.
[02:43:39.558 --> 02:43:42.339]  It takes a lot of money to run the servers, the bandwidth, to do everything we do.
[02:43:42.339 --> 02:43:45.422]  We're victims of our own success.
[02:43:45.422 --> 02:43:48.964]  You know, I don't like to get up here and exaggerate, so I automatically dial stuff back.
[02:43:48.964 --> 02:43:53.107]  The last six months, the audio and video streams have basically tripled.
[02:43:54.926 --> 02:43:56.727]  Well, it's worse than that.
[02:43:56.727 --> 02:43:58.868]  It's just shooting straight up.
[02:43:58.868 --> 02:44:07.653]  And we've got really cheap, good bandwidth, but, I mean, one stream was $56,000 last month.
[02:44:07.653 --> 02:44:09.854]  And we buy it from one of the biggest companies in the world.
[02:44:09.854 --> 02:44:11.615]  I mean, you know, the folks Google gets it from.
[02:44:11.615 --> 02:44:18.659]  I mean, you think about, really, you know, 15, 16 million people tuned in on one stream in a month.
[02:44:18.659 --> 02:44:22.161]  Just our video stream at Infowars.com forward slash show, and I gotta pay $56,000
[02:44:26.209 --> 02:44:33.490]  And they have shows with 60 million viewers on TV that, you know, have like $10 million in advertising money comes in, $5 million episode budgets.
[02:44:34.693 --> 02:44:37.495]  I mean, that video stream probably didn't bring in $20,000 a month.
[02:44:37.495 --> 02:44:39.776]  I mean, you know, it just gets it.
[02:44:39.776 --> 02:44:42.218]  And I understand we're super successful at reaching people.
[02:44:42.218 --> 02:44:43.919]  We're just not successful at making money.
[02:44:43.919 --> 02:44:46.720]  I mean, compared to other alternative medias, we're the king.
[02:44:46.720 --> 02:44:48.762]  We're going to surpass Glenn Beck, whatever.
[02:44:48.762 --> 02:44:51.363]  When it comes to money, that's just fuel.
[02:44:51.363 --> 02:44:52.404]  I need fuel.
[02:44:52.404 --> 02:44:54.745]  I need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:44:54.745 --> 02:44:57.787]  We got great items, great products at discounted prices.

[02:45:13.053 --> 02:45:20.455]  We need that support to continue and to expand because we are exploding.
[02:45:20.455 --> 02:45:27.578]  But in any business, and we're not a business first and foremost, we're not ashamed that we use a business model to fund our revolution against tyrants.
[02:45:29.935 --> 02:45:38.001]  So, we need funds, and look at the mirror and ask yourselves, are you buying products at Infowarsstore.com?
[02:45:38.001 --> 02:45:40.743]  Are you spreading the word about the local stations you listen to?
[02:45:40.743 --> 02:45:44.947]  Are you sending out the links to the video and audio feeds?
[02:45:44.947 --> 02:45:55.375]  I'm not telling you to do it, but is there a weapons system against the enemy more savage, more committed, more naked, more vicious, more primal?
[02:45:55.375 --> 02:45:55.495]  No.
[02:45:56.806 --> 02:45:59.547]  We are the death throes of the Republic.
[02:45:59.547 --> 02:46:01.107]  We're the manifestation of that.
[02:46:01.107 --> 02:46:06.088]  And in the death throes, a death throe, a death struggle is a lot of strength to get out.
[02:46:06.088 --> 02:46:08.129]  The enemy's driving a knife right down in us.
[02:46:08.129 --> 02:46:09.469]  It's already going into us.
[02:46:09.469 --> 02:46:12.249]  You gotta decide you're getting them off of you.
[02:46:12.249 --> 02:46:13.150]  There's no debating it.
[02:46:13.150 --> 02:46:14.690]  You're gonna roll them off of you.
[02:46:14.690 --> 02:46:17.611]  And you're gonna grab with superhuman force that knife politically.
[02:46:17.611 --> 02:46:19.111]  You're gonna ram it right up in their neck.
[02:46:21.107 --> 02:46:22.227]  You've got to decide to do it.
[02:46:22.227 --> 02:46:23.948]  There is no think about it.
[02:46:23.948 --> 02:46:25.128]  You've got to decide to do it.
[02:46:25.128 --> 02:46:28.929]  Politically, you've got to get savage.
[02:46:28.929 --> 02:46:30.650]  We'll beat these people, but you've got to commit.
[02:46:30.650 --> 02:46:31.790]  Stop letting them intimidate you.
[02:46:31.790 --> 02:46:33.390]  You've got to ram your head up against the wall.
[02:46:33.390 --> 02:46:34.631]  You've got to get your teeth out.
[02:46:34.631 --> 02:46:36.231]  You've got to get ready.
[02:46:36.231 --> 02:46:37.691]  Because they're going to attack anyways.
[02:46:37.691 --> 02:46:40.552]  You might as well stand up.
[02:46:40.552 --> 02:46:41.873]  And look at the crap we're up against.
[02:46:41.873 --> 02:46:44.653]  Look at these piles of filth that stole our wealth to build this system.
[02:46:44.653 --> 02:46:46.214]  And they sit up there to intimidate us.
[02:46:46.214 --> 02:46:46.734]  They're nothing.
[02:46:49.102 --> 02:46:52.664]  What does it say about us if we let them tame us?
[02:46:52.664 --> 02:46:53.945]  A mouse taming a lion.
[02:46:53.945 --> 02:46:54.986]  It's a joke.
[02:46:54.986 --> 02:46:57.007]  You could see these freaks spiritually, folks.
[02:46:57.007 --> 02:47:01.570]  You'd realize it's in our hands to defeat them instantly the moment we realize what scum they are.
[02:47:01.570 --> 02:47:03.712]  And that's happening right now.
[02:47:03.712 --> 02:47:05.673]  It's beginning.
[02:47:05.673 --> 02:47:09.316]  The truth is coming out and removing the eclipse.
[02:47:09.316 --> 02:47:12.598]  But they're racing.
[02:47:12.598 --> 02:47:16.521]  It is the allegory of the X-Wings going down the reactor shaft
[02:47:17.631 --> 02:47:20.153]  Trying to fire the torpedo down it.
[02:47:20.153 --> 02:47:22.514]  And the Death Star is orbiting the planet ready to fire.
[02:47:22.514 --> 02:47:24.736]  I mean, it's like that, folks.
[02:47:24.736 --> 02:47:30.059]  And everything you do now has the effect.
[02:47:30.059 --> 02:47:33.441]  All right, who's up first here?
[02:47:33.441 --> 02:47:35.903]  Let's go to Kimberly in West Virginia.
[02:47:35.903 --> 02:47:37.003]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:47:37.003 --> 02:47:39.805]  Alex?
[02:47:39.805 --> 02:47:40.546]  Hey, welcome.
[02:47:40.546 --> 02:47:42.026]  Thank you.
[02:47:42.026 --> 02:47:42.627]  Hi.
[02:47:42.627 --> 02:47:45.889]  Okay, well, as for Rand Paul and Trump,
[02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:53.665]  To be honest with you, if they truly love America, this is what they will do.
[02:47:53.665 --> 02:47:56.868]  Trump will take presidency.
[02:47:56.868 --> 02:47:59.870]  Paul will take vice president.
[02:47:59.870 --> 02:48:10.119]  Only vice president will step up to a more powerful, you know, front next to the president role.
[02:48:10.119 --> 02:48:12.901]  But here's the problem, Alex.
[02:48:12.901 --> 02:48:15.303]  I don't believe for one minute there will be a 2016 election.
[02:48:17.638 --> 02:48:20.399]  That's America's problem.
[02:48:20.399 --> 02:48:24.821]  You know, to be honest with you, this is what I believe.
[02:48:24.821 --> 02:48:33.345]  The EU announced that oil may be going to $10 a barrel today.
[02:48:33.345 --> 02:48:34.265]  Okay?
[02:48:34.265 --> 02:48:40.968]  Twelve of our Navy sailors were taken by Iran today.
[02:48:44.656 --> 02:48:48.600]  Well I'll tell you what, this is a repeat of Mr. Peanut Man.
[02:48:48.600 --> 02:48:53.485]  And you were a little, well you were a little, you're younger than me, but you remember Carter.
[02:48:53.485 --> 02:48:53.985]  Yes.
[02:48:53.985 --> 02:48:57.409]  You know, they had our, they're just doing the repeat.
[02:48:57.409 --> 02:48:59.251]  I really truly believe that
[02:49:00.248 --> 02:49:06.630]  Those false sailors are what Obama got out of the treaty with Iran.
[02:49:06.630 --> 02:49:07.990]  Take false sailors.
[02:49:07.990 --> 02:49:12.792]  Well, I did think it was like the Republicans with that deal with Iran to make Carter look bad.
[02:49:12.792 --> 02:49:14.732]  I mean, that was a staged event.
[02:49:14.732 --> 02:49:18.213]  And it kind of seems like the hostage rescue thing all over again.
[02:49:18.213 --> 02:49:19.414]  We'll see if that actually happens.
[02:49:20.745 --> 02:49:25.369]  You've got big banks, big central banks, big groups saying sell everything, collapse is coming.
[02:49:25.369 --> 02:49:27.470]  You've got Soros running around saying it.
[02:49:27.470 --> 02:49:33.715]  You've got all the planets aligning politically for a lot of crazy stuff to happen.
[02:49:33.715 --> 02:49:37.538]  And, you know, I know Trump and Paul were friends and played golf quite a bit.
[02:49:37.538 --> 02:49:41.321]  And Trump says, you know, that Rand is an amazing golfer and all these compliments.
[02:49:41.321 --> 02:49:45.985]  You know, I wish the two would start being friends, but he was one of Trump's big challenges early on.
[02:49:47.185 --> 02:49:51.587]  And that's one thing Rand did that I thought was a mistake, was bash Trump when Trump was so popular.
[02:49:51.587 --> 02:49:54.389]  Cruz was smart and said nice things.
[02:49:54.389 --> 02:49:57.251]  And so that was another miscalculation.
[02:49:57.251 --> 02:49:59.032]  And Paul kind of jumped the shark on that.
[02:49:59.032 --> 02:50:00.793]  I'm being honest.
[02:50:00.793 --> 02:50:07.616]  So I would hope that if Trump does win, that he works with Senator Paul in some way.
[02:50:07.616 --> 02:50:10.018]  But I hear you and I appreciate your call, Kimberly.
[02:50:10.018 --> 02:50:12.259]  We're going to go to break and we're going to come back.
[02:50:12.259 --> 02:50:14.860]  I'm going to do five minutes to the next hour and then we have David Knight coming up.
[02:50:14.860 --> 02:50:15.601]  I'm going to go to Everett.
[02:50:17.136 --> 02:50:21.219]  Maya, Jason, Antoine, and others straight ahead.
[02:50:21.219 --> 02:50:25.063]  David Knight will host the fourth hour today.
[02:50:25.063 --> 02:50:28.265]  Jokari will be debuting his ghost gun report.
[02:50:28.265 --> 02:50:30.007]  This is really amazing.
[02:50:30.007 --> 02:50:32.789]  Bad timing for Obama as he pushes for self-driving cars.
[02:50:32.789 --> 02:50:36.412]  Video services of car driving in an endless loop backwards.
[02:50:36.412 --> 02:50:38.574]  Well, they want to beta test it and make us accept it.
[02:50:38.574 --> 02:50:41.236]  That's to get rid of humans and get rid of driving and taxes by the mile.
[02:50:41.236 --> 02:50:45.360]  That's why I'm not against self-driving cars, except the whole plan is a takeover.
[02:50:46.647 --> 02:50:49.609]  Two Gitmo prisoners released without charge for 14 years.
[02:50:49.609 --> 02:50:52.791]  Big money GOP donors feel they wasted their money.
[02:50:52.791 --> 02:50:54.472]  Some super PACs shutting down.
[02:50:54.472 --> 02:50:57.194]  What does this tell you about the decline of traditional media?
[02:50:57.194 --> 02:51:00.396]  Yet another UN peacekeeper child sex scandal and more.

[02:54:12.289 --> 02:54:14.470]  This one's up on Infowars.com.
[02:54:16.972 --> 02:54:20.475]  And of course, they'll probably try to make these refugees congressmen or something.
[02:54:20.475 --> 02:54:22.477]  Because that's what they like to do.
[02:54:22.477 --> 02:54:26.620]  Syrian refugees rape three-year-old boy in Norway.
[02:54:26.620 --> 02:54:29.142]  Migrants raping women, children in Europe.
[02:54:29.142 --> 02:54:31.524]  Just massively, thousands of them.
[02:54:31.524 --> 02:54:33.146]  Because it's a jihad and they deserve it.
[02:54:33.146 --> 02:54:35.348]  You know, if you're not part of the jihad, then it's gonna happen.
[02:54:36.479 --> 02:54:36.839]  Hello, Alex.
[02:54:36.839 --> 02:54:38.580]  Before I get to the topic, I just want to say
[02:55:03.658 --> 02:55:05.999]  You and your crew are excellent.
[02:55:05.999 --> 02:55:08.980]  Been listening to you since over the last summer.
[02:55:08.980 --> 02:55:14.081]  Well, brother, we're just trying to expose the craziness that's out in the open, but thank you.
[02:55:14.081 --> 02:55:14.981]  Oh, you're not kidding.
[02:55:14.981 --> 02:55:26.104]  But anyway, on Trump, though, I don't agree with everything that he says, but either way, he is far better than Hillary Clinton.
[02:55:26.104 --> 02:55:29.365]  And over here in Rhode Island, there's so many Hillary supporters.
[02:55:29.365 --> 02:55:31.746]  I don't know why, don't know how, but
[02:55:32.364 --> 02:55:35.506]  It's just how it is over there, and I don't like it whatsoever.
[02:55:35.506 --> 02:55:45.271]  But on Rand Paul, he's trying his very best to protect our constitutional rights, because they're being slowly taken away from us.
[02:55:45.271 --> 02:55:54.896]  When he had that rant on C-SPAN over the summertime, arguing to try to get five minutes to speak, that opened my eyes wide open.
[02:55:54.896 --> 02:56:01.540]  And people don't realize it, that slowly but surely, if they can take away our Second Amendment
[02:56:02.594 --> 02:56:11.418]  They will take anything away from us, and bottom line, that's all he's been doing right from the get is to defend our constitutional rights.
[02:56:11.418 --> 02:56:17.921]  Rand Paul has a great record, and that's why the establishment attacked him as not being patriot enough.
[02:56:17.921 --> 02:56:27.205]  But they have absolutely tried to shut him down, and regardless, even if he doesn't win this one, down the road for presidency or whatever, it's just good to have him there.
[02:56:27.205 --> 02:56:29.606]  And you're absolutely right, they've done everything they can to block him.
[02:56:29.606 --> 02:56:30.667]  Thank you so much for calling.
[02:56:32.517 --> 02:56:34.317]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:56:34.317 --> 02:56:36.738]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ben in Florida.
[02:56:36.738 --> 02:56:37.318]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:56:37.318 --> 02:56:39.658]  You're on the air.
[02:56:39.658 --> 02:56:40.099]  Hi, Alex.
[02:56:40.099 --> 02:56:44.099]  First of all, I just wanted to say, great interview there with Senator Paul.
[02:56:44.099 --> 02:56:48.100]  Quick question for you, and then I'll go, because I know you have a thousand other callers.
[02:56:48.100 --> 02:56:51.881]  In your mind, we know there's a financial collapse coming.
[02:56:51.881 --> 02:56:53.341]  You've talked about it.
[02:56:53.341 --> 02:56:54.681]  Who is the most qualified?
[02:56:54.681 --> 02:56:55.882]  Is it going to be a Donald Trump?
[02:56:55.882 --> 02:56:56.922]  Is it going to be a Rand Paul?
[02:56:56.922 --> 02:57:02.143]  Who's the most qualified out of the GOP to help get us out of that eventual collapse in your mind?
[02:57:02.790 --> 02:57:13.537]  Well, so much of this is confidence, so much of this is bringing jobs back and not having basically political and bureaucratic hidden tariffs that shut us down.
[02:57:13.537 --> 02:57:19.661]  But in a global depression, they're going to try to continue the global depression and give the global banks more power.
[02:57:19.661 --> 02:57:21.682]  So just not letting them do that's key.
[02:57:21.682 --> 02:57:25.825]  And I would say, you know, Rand Paul would be great about going after the central banks.
[02:57:25.825 --> 02:57:27.666]  Trump would be great about getting the jobs back here.
[02:57:28.566 --> 02:57:29.246]  I really don't know.
[02:57:29.246 --> 02:57:30.547]  That's a complex question.
[02:57:30.547 --> 02:57:33.088]  You know, also think, hey, let Hillary get in.
[02:57:33.088 --> 02:57:34.708]  Their whole agenda will stall.
[02:57:34.708 --> 02:57:36.989]  She'll get the blame for the global depression.
[02:57:36.989 --> 02:57:41.211]  Are they about to give it to Trump to then blame a capitalist for what's about to happen?
[02:57:41.211 --> 02:57:45.012]  You know, there's globalists above Hillary and above Trump fighting for power.
[02:57:45.012 --> 02:57:47.333]  And they've got larger, more sophisticated views.
[02:57:47.333 --> 02:57:47.913]  Here's an example.
[02:57:48.815 --> 02:57:55.439]  If Hillary got in, Infowars would probably be more successful and have more viewers and listeners than if a Trump got in and people went back to sleep.
[02:57:55.439 --> 02:57:57.520]  But the same bureaucracy continued on.
[02:57:57.520 --> 02:57:58.741]  That happened under Bush.
[02:57:58.741 --> 02:57:59.541]  But I don't care.
[02:57:59.541 --> 02:58:03.604]  I'd rather get a Trump in because I think he's better for the country, though it's not good for my show.
[02:58:04.164 --> 02:58:09.767]  Because Hillary might go so far as arresting me or, you know, starting World War III.
[02:58:09.767 --> 02:58:12.308]  So I don't do stuff off of what's going to help me.
[02:58:12.308 --> 02:58:24.053]  I make my decisions off of what I think is really constitutional common sense and doesn't get my alarms going off with my God-fearing censor that I call my conscience.
[02:58:24.053 --> 02:58:24.954]  But that's what I think.
[02:58:24.954 --> 02:58:26.834]  I mean, I'm not dozzing your question.
[02:58:26.834 --> 02:58:29.496]  I think either one of them would probably be better for the economy than what we got.
[02:58:29.496 --> 02:58:29.976]  What do you think?
[02:58:31.471 --> 02:58:36.859]  I absolutely agree with you and Trump is my second pick, just like you said.
[02:58:36.859 --> 02:58:37.841]  Alright Ben, good to hear from you.
[02:58:37.841 --> 02:58:40.104]  We'll be back in the fourth hour.
[02:58:40.104 --> 02:58:41.386]  We've got David Knight coming up.
[02:58:41.386 --> 02:58:43.269]  I'm gonna do five more minutes, more calls.
[02:58:43.269 --> 02:58:44.070]  And Jakari Jackson.
[02:58:44.070 --> 02:58:45.653]  There's so much in this fourth hour.
[02:58:45.653 --> 02:58:47.095]  Got a fresh horse coming into the fight.
[02:58:50.032 --> 02:58:57.236]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.
[02:58:57.236 --> 02:59:06.920]  At InfoWarsLife, our mission is to bring you the highest quality, purest, cleanest, effective colloidal silver on the market today for the lowest price available.

[02:59:14.264 --> 02:59:22.090]  Infowarslife.com developed Silver Bullet by closely working with one of the top silver manufacturing labs in the United States.
[02:59:22.090 --> 02:59:25.793]  We set out to bring you the very best at the lowest price.

[02:59:30.757 --> 02:59:35.161]  In these times, it's essential to have high-quality, loyal silver on hand.

[02:59:38.183 --> 02:59:41.326]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:41.326 --> 02:59:42.807]  Secure your Silver Bullet today.
[02:59:43.187 --> 02:59:44.810]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:03.140 --> 03:00:12.629]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:12.629 --> 03:00:15.712]  By the way, we probably need to send this out on Twitter and post this to Facebook.
[03:00:15.712 --> 03:00:17.173]  We're not just going to have our free feed.
[03:00:17.173 --> 03:00:24.279]  The Nightly News is normally a subscription tonight, but we also send it out free on a feed at the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[03:00:25.040 --> 03:00:29.465]  We've got to really promote that link instead of ours so I don't go bankrupt over here, too many viewers.
[03:00:29.465 --> 03:00:40.017]  Infowars.com forward slash show to find the free feed or go to the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube and you can see Mystery Science 3k Republican coverage.
[03:00:40.598 --> 03:00:45.702]  We probably just need to say, live analysis of a Republican debate.
[03:00:45.702 --> 03:00:53.347]  We can send this link out, youtube.com forward slash, and the rest of the link there, to the Twitter, the Facebook, and post that on infowars.com.
[03:00:53.347 --> 03:00:58.310]  Because they're always telling me, hey, plug on the show to everybody that we got coverage of the debate.
[03:00:58.310 --> 03:01:04.054]  Well, I mean, this audience, the main core audience, will be tuning in to presentplanet.tv tonight.
[03:01:04.054 --> 03:01:06.876]  And a lot of our affiliates are now carrying it.
[03:01:06.876 --> 03:01:07.797]  Or tomorrow night, excuse me.
[03:01:09.241 --> 03:01:13.687]  But it's the general public out there in cyberspace that we send this link to.
[03:01:13.687 --> 03:01:17.552]  Our email list, everything else, that's how you promote that link.
[03:01:17.552 --> 03:01:18.893]  I'm just telling the folks in there.
[03:01:20.488 --> 03:01:22.209]  We're doing a fabulous job, by the way.
[03:01:22.209 --> 03:01:23.850]  It's just that I really do want to promote that link.
[03:01:23.850 --> 03:01:32.857]  I'll be doing some Facebook mentions tomorrow as well during it and using every other globalist platform to get the word out successfully trying to counter this system.
[03:01:32.857 --> 03:01:34.978]  And by the way, we are doing six months free right now.
[03:01:34.978 --> 03:01:39.182]  We never do this ever six months, but I'm just doing it because I want to get it out.
[03:01:39.182 --> 03:01:41.503]  20 people can use each username or membership.
[03:01:41.503 --> 03:01:46.087]  So 20 people for $5.95 a month or get a year and get it for half off.
[03:01:46.607 --> 03:01:51.172]  Normally you get like two months free, so it's $54.95 off the regular price.
[03:01:51.172 --> 03:01:54.054]  You know, instead of $60 something, it's like $54.
[03:01:54.054 --> 03:01:56.677]  Well, now you get it for $36.50.
[03:01:56.677 --> 03:02:01.141]  Six months free when you sign up, and that funds what we're doing.
[03:02:01.141 --> 03:02:02.963]  And then it's your platform.
[03:02:02.963 --> 03:02:04.905]  It can't be censored as easily.
[03:02:04.905 --> 03:02:06.547]  There's special live events.
[03:02:06.547 --> 03:02:07.348]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:02:09.409 --> 03:02:11.391]  InfoWarsNews.com.
[03:02:11.391 --> 03:02:12.472]  Don't procrastinate.
[03:02:12.472 --> 03:02:15.015]  It's essential to fund the operation.
[03:02:15.015 --> 03:02:18.478]  You're certainly spreading the word about it, believe me.
[03:02:18.478 --> 03:02:20.060]  And we'll adapt and overcome.
[03:02:20.060 --> 03:02:24.344]  And if we have to get rid of the free feed at InfoWars.com forward slash show, we will.
[03:02:24.344 --> 03:02:26.967]  And maybe have a YouTube feed every day and just put it on the page.
[03:02:26.967 --> 03:02:28.528]  I don't know.
[03:02:28.528 --> 03:02:30.630]  But thank you for being PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[03:02:33.007 --> 03:02:37.289]  Oh yeah, I didn't get to this, so the callers, David can get to those, because I'm almost out of time anyways.
[03:02:37.289 --> 03:02:41.751]  I want to talk to Jason and Maya and Antoine and Steve and Kenny and others.
[03:02:41.751 --> 03:02:47.874]  Chris Carter came out in a couple of news articles and said, based on the new X-Files, pretty much on InfoWars, the scripts, and Alex Jones.
[03:02:47.874 --> 03:02:55.497]  We're even having an Alex Jones character that, like a huggy bear on Starsky and Hutch that they learned from, or Gandalf that leads them through, who's the authority figure.
[03:02:55.497 --> 03:03:01.020]  And he said, I don't think Alex Jones is right-wing, I think he's a libertarian, and I think world government's real and it's happening.
[03:03:01.020 --> 03:03:01.220]  Wow!
[03:03:02.040 --> 03:03:05.101]  And we're now in contact with Carter, so look for that.
[03:03:05.101 --> 03:03:08.262]  And the trolls, both mainstream, said it wasn't happening.
[03:03:08.262 --> 03:03:09.942]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:03:09.942 --> 03:03:10.942]  I lied about it all.
[03:03:10.942 --> 03:03:12.303]  I'm Brian Williams.
[03:03:12.303 --> 03:03:14.463]  Everything's a lie.
[03:03:14.463 --> 03:03:16.884]  How much energy do you take to lie for three or four hours a day?
[03:03:16.884 --> 03:03:20.685]  To just spew truth obnoxiously?
[03:03:20.685 --> 03:03:26.646]  But here's a clip from their promo of the new X-Files season 2016 where they talk about Alex Jones.
[03:03:26.646 --> 03:03:29.067]  Here's actual video, not just text of it.
[03:03:29.067 --> 03:03:29.927]  And then we'll go to David Knight.
[03:03:31.345 --> 03:03:33.066]  9-11 was a false flag operation.
[03:03:33.066 --> 03:03:34.926]  It was a warm-up to World War III.
[03:03:34.926 --> 03:03:38.687]  Joe McHale plays Tad O'Malley, who's a conservative talk show host.
[03:03:38.687 --> 03:03:46.469]  Just knowing that I was going to be able to be on this series, that I am a massive fan of, I couldn't believe my good fortune.
[03:03:46.469 --> 03:03:49.350]  And then you meet David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson.
[03:03:49.350 --> 03:03:52.871]  They are so cool, and I asked them way too many questions.
[03:03:52.871 --> 03:03:57.652]  I think they detected that I was a fan, especially when I asked them to sign my skin with a tattoo needle.
[03:03:58.192 --> 03:04:08.274]  I cast Joel McHale after seeing his appearance at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, which was hilarious, and he had exactly the quality I was looking for.
[03:04:08.274 --> 03:04:15.535]  He is very conservative, but his ideas about conspiracy theories match up exactly with Mulder's.
[03:04:15.535 --> 03:04:21.536]  It's all part of a conspiracy dating back to the UFO crash at Roswell in 1947.
[03:04:21.536 --> 03:04:24.677]  My character wants to get a hold of Mulder, and that's how it starts.
[03:04:24.997 --> 03:04:26.378]  Join me for a little ride?
[03:04:26.378 --> 03:04:27.558]  Right here is fine.
[03:04:27.558 --> 03:04:32.580]  Low-flying aircraft often employ what they call dirt boxes to record conversations that I prefer private.
[03:04:32.580 --> 03:04:34.181]  Aircraft employed by whom?
[03:04:34.181 --> 03:04:43.064]  He's really an amalgamation of so many characters on the internet who believe that there is not just an alien conspiracy but a possible conspiracy of men.
[03:04:43.064 --> 03:04:44.185]  What I need is your expertise.
[03:04:44.665 --> 03:04:46.167]  Our expertise for what?
[03:04:46.167 --> 03:04:49.010]  I'm rattling some pretty big cages in the intelligence community.
[03:04:49.010 --> 03:04:50.391]  I start a ball roll.
[03:04:50.391 --> 03:04:54.055]  That's enough, we can't get to it all and then they go through the article saying it's based on me.
[03:04:54.055 --> 03:04:59.920]  Alright folks, David Knight's coming up, Jakari Jackson and more.
[03:04:59.920 --> 03:05:04.265]  Remember when Congressman Joe Wilson couldn't contain himself any longer and shouted at Obama?
[03:05:07.699 --> 03:05:11.343]  We needed that on a loop for Obama's last State of the Union.
[03:05:11.343 --> 03:05:14.466]  A story on FOWars.com looks at three of his biggest lies.
[03:05:14.466 --> 03:05:24.176]  Obama continues to pretend we're focused on destroying ISIS when there's been a continuous stream of information showing we created, funded, and armed ISIS and continue to do so.
[03:05:24.176 --> 03:05:28.420]  He claimed Obamacare created jobs when in fact it caused companies that can't afford it
[03:05:30.936 --> 03:05:31.396]  Hey!
[03:05:31.396 --> 03:05:34.078]  You now have two different jobs to make ends meet.
[03:05:34.078 --> 03:05:35.419]  Why are you complaining?
[03:05:35.419 --> 03:05:38.081]  And then there's the strongest economy in the world claim.
[03:05:38.081 --> 03:05:43.944]  The reality is, all jobs growth has gone to immigrants, with 17% of jobs now held by immigrants.
[03:05:43.944 --> 03:05:46.906]  And the stock market this year is down 20%.
[03:05:46.906 --> 03:05:56.212]  And there's the absurd claim about the resurgence of Donald Trump, when General Motors has exported most of the jobs to China, and Chrysler was sold to Fiat for a song.
[03:05:56.212 --> 03:05:58.353]  For more information, go to Infowars.com.
[03:05:58.353 --> 03:05:58.934]  I'm David Knight.
[03:05:59.716 --> 03:06:03.217]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:06:03.217 --> 03:06:11.480]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:06:11.480 --> 03:06:16.881]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:06:16.881 --> 03:06:19.422]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[03:06:34.032 --> 03:06:38.195]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[03:06:59.551 --> 03:07:09.035]  InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winner's Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[03:07:09.035 --> 03:07:13.717]  Winner's Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[03:07:13.717 --> 03:07:18.499]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[03:07:18.499 --> 03:07:21.560]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[03:07:21.560 --> 03:07:23.982]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[03:07:23.982 --> 03:07:27.363]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[03:07:27.523 --> 03:07:31.424]  Winter Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of vitamin D3.
[03:07:31.424 --> 03:07:40.467]  The research and development took over two years, but the result, as verified by independent laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[03:07:40.467 --> 03:07:45.489]  Read the facts at InfoWarsLife.com about Winter Sun vitamin D3.

[03:08:14.381 --> 03:08:19.523]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:08:23.041 --> 03:08:24.901]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:24.901 --> 03:08:30.103]  I'm David Knight, your host for the rest of this hour on this Wednesday, January 13th, 2016.
[03:08:30.103 --> 03:08:39.745]  I've got a lot of stories here, especially because Rand Paul was on earlier with Alex Jones, and of course he's at the center of a lot of political news today.
[03:08:39.745 --> 03:08:46.687]  Not only what's going on with the debate, and we want to look at some of the details about his exclusion, his possible exclusion.
[03:08:46.687 --> 03:08:50.748]  See if, hopefully, Fox will change their mind, and we'll tell you why I think
[03:08:51.528 --> 03:08:52.528]  They should change their mind.
[03:08:52.528 --> 03:08:58.010]  But also, the fact that his Audit the Fed bill was introduced and yet failed.
[03:08:58.010 --> 03:08:59.470]  So we're going to unpack that for you.
[03:08:59.470 --> 03:09:00.791]  Why is that important?
[03:09:00.791 --> 03:09:01.911]  Who voted for it?
[03:09:01.911 --> 03:09:02.991]  Who voted against it?
[03:09:02.991 --> 03:09:04.732]  We'll talk about that as well.
[03:09:04.732 --> 03:09:07.373]  And of course, things are shifting around with Republican donors.
[03:09:07.373 --> 03:09:10.333]  They're starting to fold some of the super PACs.
[03:09:10.333 --> 03:09:16.015]  They've spent millions of dollars trying to get Jeb Bush elected and it's having absolute
[03:09:16.115 --> 03:09:16.615]  We're good to go.
[03:09:46.195 --> 03:09:57.887]  Caught in another scandal of going into a country and using the underage children, raping them, turning them into prostitutes, paying them 50 cents for sex.
[03:09:57.887 --> 03:10:04.254]  This has been something of a tradition now for the United Nations as they go into these places.
[03:10:04.474 --> 03:10:05.595]  There's been so many of these stories.
[03:10:05.595 --> 03:10:09.038]  When I first saw this story, I thought, this is an old story.
[03:10:09.038 --> 03:10:10.420]  Yes, it is an old story.
[03:10:10.420 --> 03:10:12.201]  And it keeps repeating itself.
[03:10:12.201 --> 03:10:14.303]  So we're going to go into all of that and much more.
[03:10:14.303 --> 03:10:17.607]  But first, I want to play for you this report Jakari Jackson did.
[03:10:17.607 --> 03:10:20.950]  He interviewed Cody Wilson about Cody's ghost gun.
[03:10:20.950 --> 03:10:25.994]  And I understand that when Obama talks about doing gun control, what he wants to do is create smart guns.
[03:10:25.994 --> 03:10:27.896]  Now, the people don't want smart guns.
[03:10:27.896 --> 03:10:29.258]  And why don't they want smart guns?
[03:10:29.778 --> 03:10:35.399]  Well, the addition of a lot of complicated technology makes these guns far less reliable.
[03:10:35.399 --> 03:10:38.420]  If you're going to have a gun for protection, you need it to be reliable.
[03:10:38.420 --> 03:10:42.281]  But it also makes it far more trackable and controllable by the government.
[03:10:42.281 --> 03:10:45.721]  That's why Obama is pushing what people don't want.
[03:10:45.721 --> 03:10:48.342]  Now, the ghost gun just does just the opposite.
[03:10:48.342 --> 03:10:51.243]  It uses technology to make guns.
[03:10:51.243 --> 03:10:57.364]  And when you make your own guns, the government doesn't have nearly the kind of control that it wants to have.
[03:10:57.364 --> 03:10:58.144]  Let's go to that report.
[03:10:59.178 --> 03:11:01.979]  Jakari Jackson reporting for InfoWars.com.
[03:11:01.979 --> 03:11:04.000]  Today we are in the city of Austin, Texas.
[03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:07.562]  We're on our way to see printable gun pioneer Cody Wilson.
[03:11:07.562 --> 03:11:15.345]  Now you guys may recall, Cody, he made headlines many years ago for his production of the Liberator, the first 3D printed pistol.
[03:11:15.345 --> 03:11:22.688]  Since then, his technology has advanced and he actually has a shop that we're going to see where he assembles what is known as the Ghost Gunner.
[03:11:22.688 --> 03:11:27.070]  It's a mill that allows you to make, among many other things, a lower receiver for an AR-15.
[03:11:27.970 --> 03:11:35.317]  So we're going to go check out his shop and see what he thinks about the recent reasonable gun control proposals made by the President.
[03:11:35.317 --> 03:11:40.983]  Okay, so we're here with Cody Wilson and he's going to walk us through Defense Distributed and show us how he fabricates the Ghost Gunner.
[03:11:40.983 --> 03:11:41.824]  Cody?
[03:11:41.824 --> 03:11:42.184]  Hitchcock?
[03:11:42.184 --> 03:11:42.724]  Yes.
[03:11:42.724 --> 03:11:44.766]  Alright, you're in the shop, small shop.
[03:11:44.766 --> 03:11:46.368]  Let's come to the back.
[03:11:46.368 --> 03:11:47.129]  Assembly line model.
[03:11:49.420 --> 03:11:51.041]  As long as you're happy with the machine looking like this.
[03:11:51.041 --> 03:11:52.122]  Okay.
[03:11:52.122 --> 03:11:53.002]  That's what it looks like.
[03:11:53.002 --> 03:11:53.663]  That's what we make.
[03:11:53.663 --> 03:11:54.704]  There's no variation.
[03:11:54.704 --> 03:11:55.444]  Everything's the same.
[03:11:55.444 --> 03:11:58.666]  It's the Model T of personal assault weapon fabrication.
[03:11:58.666 --> 03:12:01.488]  We start with an empty shell over here.
[03:12:01.488 --> 03:12:05.311]  Machine proceeds around the assembly line in a U. Comes back down through here.
[03:12:06.856 --> 03:12:22.141]  It takes a lot of sub-assemblies from the back, which are inserted as it goes, gets fitted out with electronics, power supply, we do a little bit of setup code testing, comes off the line, goes out the back door to your house.
[03:12:22.141 --> 03:12:23.801]  So what exactly does the Ghost Gunner do?
[03:12:27.799 --> 03:12:28.862]  In actuality, just a mill.
[03:12:28.862 --> 03:12:31.387]  Just a very tiny computer-controlled mill.
[03:12:31.387 --> 03:12:38.120]  A computer tells a moving end mill in space where to go, how to carve out a piece of aluminum that you can kind of bolt down to a work surface.
[03:12:38.120 --> 03:12:38.301]  It is...
[03:12:39.517 --> 03:12:41.459]  Previous century technology.
[03:12:41.459 --> 03:12:45.262]  There is nothing in it, of it, that it is itself revolutionary.
[03:12:45.262 --> 03:12:47.364]  But when you ask me, what does a ghost gunner do?
[03:12:47.364 --> 03:12:48.705]  I don't really think about the milling.
[03:12:48.705 --> 03:12:51.327]  I think about what it does to the liberal imagination.
[03:12:51.327 --> 03:12:54.930]  What it does to the elitist gun control imaginary.
[03:12:54.930 --> 03:12:55.710]  It destroys it.
[03:12:55.710 --> 03:12:56.931]  That's what the ghost gunner really does.
[03:12:56.931 --> 03:13:03.177]  And now secretly, in garages in a neighborhood near you, someone may, or may not be, manufacturing an AR-15 in their garage.
[03:13:03.917 --> 03:13:10.199]  The Ghost Gunner has a price tag of $1,500 and sports a very long waiting list.
[03:13:10.199 --> 03:13:20.764]  Cody's machine has the ability to take a hunk of billet aluminum, known as an 80% lower receiver, and mill it into a principal part of an AR-15 rifle.
[03:13:20.764 --> 03:13:24.685]  But as one might expect, not all politicians are on board.
[03:13:24.685 --> 03:13:31.548]  This, again, is the engine to the high-powered semi-automatic assault weapons that you see displayed here today.
[03:13:31.548 --> 03:13:32.028]  With that,
[03:13:32.844 --> 03:13:40.249]  The lower receiver, an individual can buy this $80 to $100 online.
[03:13:40.249 --> 03:13:46.012]  This doesn't have a serial number and it doesn't require a background check.
[03:13:46.012 --> 03:13:50.555]  All the person has to do, go to someone who has a drool press.
[03:13:50.555 --> 03:13:53.777]  You are a self-proclaimed anarchist, correct?
[03:13:53.777 --> 03:13:56.179]  Yeah, look, I'm anti-state now, all the way.
[03:13:56.179 --> 03:13:59.201]  Does your philosophy further your technology or your drive for technology?
[03:14:00.307 --> 03:14:02.849]  My technology furthers my philosophy.
[03:14:02.849 --> 03:14:05.271]  I'm not sure if the philosophy is furthering the technology that much.
[03:14:05.271 --> 03:14:13.017]  I mean, our insight is that change is tool-based and can be technically based.
[03:14:13.017 --> 03:14:16.619]  But I hope that I don't lapse into a certain kind of arrogant technicism.
[03:14:16.619 --> 03:14:23.745]  In 2016, President Obama made headlines by outlining plans for biometric GPS-tracked firearms.
[03:14:25.151 --> 03:14:28.853]  We need to develop new technologies that make guns safer.
[03:14:28.853 --> 03:14:39.260]  If we can set it up so you can't unlock your phone unless you got the right fingerprint, why can't we do the same thing for our guns?
[03:14:42.862 --> 03:14:47.046]  Do you have any plans to make a fingerprint scanner for a ghost gunner?
[03:14:47.046 --> 03:14:48.146]  Not at all, Jakari.
[03:14:48.146 --> 03:14:50.668]  I want every ghost gunner to look like its brother.
[03:14:50.668 --> 03:14:57.194]  I want to take as little information as legally necessary to manufacture, to ship.
[03:14:57.194 --> 03:14:59.535]  The capital stock of guns in this country will never be converted.
[03:15:00.396 --> 03:15:06.177]  ...into these new guns, and we will never see a similar capital stock of these biometric-enabled guns.
[03:15:06.177 --> 03:15:15.820]  And there is no way of even demanding, under any statutory authority present, that same level of biometrics and whatever, smart technology, in my machine.
[03:15:15.820 --> 03:15:17.320]  My machine is a milling tool.
[03:15:17.320 --> 03:15:21.321]  It's like saying, well, should your hammer have, you know, fingerprint technology?
[03:15:21.321 --> 03:15:22.121]  It's the same thing, yeah.
[03:15:22.461 --> 03:15:28.242]  Well, let me ask you, how long until a product that comes out of a Ghost Gunner is military-grade technology?
[03:15:28.242 --> 03:15:32.944]  Look, I'll answer the question that it's military-grade now.
[03:15:32.944 --> 03:15:38.005]  Commercial lower receivers for AR-15s are machined aluminum, often billet aluminum.
[03:15:38.005 --> 03:15:40.745]  You're getting the exact same product off of the Ghost Gunner.
[03:15:40.745 --> 03:15:47.087]  Two military specifications, because we base our fixturing and our software around the military spec of the AR-15 lower.
[03:15:47.087 --> 03:15:50.988]  So, you're getting functionally, materially identical components.
[03:15:51.652 --> 03:15:52.445]  To the military component.
[03:15:53.770 --> 03:15:54.910]  Now, Phil, you went to UT.
[03:15:54.910 --> 03:15:57.671]  Did you study engineering, or what did you study there?
[03:15:57.671 --> 03:15:59.531]  No, man, I studied law at UT.
[03:15:59.531 --> 03:16:15.854]  This is... A lot of the guys in this shop don't come from engineering backgrounds per se, but we think that the computer revolution, the digital revolution, they impart certain abilities, or the ability to educate yourself in a way that formal education tricks you into thinking that you can't be educated.
[03:16:15.854 --> 03:16:22.555]  So, everybody that came into this shop didn't necessarily have a hands-on, machine-type shop background, but they've got it now.
[03:16:23.095 --> 03:16:32.999]  Before the Ghost Gunner, Cody first shot to fame with the production of the Liberator, a crude single-shot 3D printable gun.
[03:16:32.999 --> 03:16:37.421]  He used his skills and equipment to print things such as magazines as well.
[03:16:37.421 --> 03:16:43.004]  So consider this, a CAD file containing the information for a 3D printable weapon system.
[03:16:44.694 --> 03:16:47.975]  That file was seeded by 30 people, I'd say.
[03:16:47.975 --> 03:16:52.856]  As long as there's a free internet, that file is available to anyone at any time, all over the world.
[03:16:52.856 --> 03:16:54.037]  Now, a gun can be anywhere.
[03:16:54.037 --> 03:16:55.777]  Any bullet is now a weapon.
[03:16:55.777 --> 03:16:59.458]  But defense distributing its goal isn't really personal armament.
[03:16:59.458 --> 03:17:00.919]  It's more the liberation of information.
[03:17:00.919 --> 03:17:04.900]  It's about living in a world where you just download the file for the thing you want to make in this life.
[03:17:04.900 --> 03:17:05.900]  This machine did a...
[03:17:06.580 --> 03:17:09.925]  All the principal liberator components for the liberator trials back in early 2013.
[03:17:09.925 --> 03:17:14.631]  It's an old 2003 Stratasys SST machine.
[03:17:14.631 --> 03:17:17.635]  I'm involved in a large lawsuit against the U.S.
[03:17:17.635 --> 03:17:22.522]  State Department that's now in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and that is fighting them over their
[03:17:23.343 --> 03:17:30.132]  They're a total blanket ban on my posting of our work here, our research, our R&D efforts to the Internet.
[03:17:30.132 --> 03:17:32.636]  They've literally targeted no one else in history.
[03:17:32.636 --> 03:17:35.479]  You can go to the Air 15 forums, you can go to any kind of catapult store you want.
[03:17:35.479 --> 03:17:37.943]  The gun files are all over the Internet and have been for years.
[03:17:37.943 --> 03:17:39.665]  DOJ got back to Congress after...
[03:17:41.423 --> 03:17:46.485]  The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act and said, oh, look, sorry, people can post bomb plans to the internet, free speech.
[03:17:46.485 --> 03:17:58.208]  But somehow after Liberator, the Obama administration was so embarrassed that they sicced the State Department on me and told me to prove it, how bad I wanted to do this kind of work.
[03:17:58.208 --> 03:18:00.709]  With this, you're printing the lower receivers, correct?
[03:18:00.709 --> 03:18:01.289]  But for a 1911, how...
[03:18:03.503 --> 03:18:07.108]  How fully functional would a 1911 be coming out of a machine like this?
[03:18:07.108 --> 03:18:13.395]  In the very same way that we're not producing an entire AR-15 on this machine, you're producing, like, the receiver.
[03:18:13.395 --> 03:18:19.803]  In the 1911, there's a frame component that can be milled out of aluminum, which is also sometimes considered to be the regulated component.
[03:18:20.063 --> 03:18:26.929]  So we're talking about creating the regulated components of guns as much as we're talking about being able to meaningfully manufacture them.
[03:18:26.929 --> 03:18:36.617]  So if I can make my own AR-15 receiver, I sidestep the entire FFL registration serialization network and I can assemble my own private AR-15.
[03:18:36.617 --> 03:18:39.459]  But I don't make every single component of that AR-15 on this machine.
[03:18:39.459 --> 03:18:42.882]  I want to read you this quote from Kalashnikov, of course the maker of the AK-47.
[03:18:43.743 --> 03:18:48.685]  I didn't want to design a weapon that was going to be used in widespread fratricidal war.
[03:18:48.685 --> 03:18:51.646]  I only wanted to help protect my country's borders.
[03:18:51.646 --> 03:18:55.248]  Now, the Ghost Gunner, the Liberator, all this stuff is in its infancy.
[03:18:55.248 --> 03:19:01.950]  Let's say the technology advances and becomes more widespread, there are more than a few bodies attributed to the technology.
[03:19:01.950 --> 03:19:06.352]  Do you foresee a day when Cody Wilson will share a sentiment similar to Kalashnikov?
[03:19:07.631 --> 03:19:10.414]  I share Kalashnikov's sentiment now.
[03:19:10.414 --> 03:19:15.921]  The rest of his sentiment was that he said, don't blame me for this technology and its use.
[03:19:15.921 --> 03:19:17.122]  Blame the politicians.
[03:19:17.122 --> 03:19:23.310]  Blame the nation-states and these large protracted wars, which are really the consequence of the behavior between states, as states.
[03:19:23.310 --> 03:19:24.691]  I have nothing to do with that.
[03:19:24.691 --> 03:19:27.495]  Whenever these people get on TV and point the finger at the hobbyists,
[03:19:28.539 --> 03:19:39.625]  They fail to mention how many AR-15s they themselves are shipping to Mexico, to Al-Nusra, through Turkey, with CIA operations and, you know, all over these theaters of war in the Middle East.
[03:19:39.625 --> 03:19:42.987]  I have nothing to do with that, now, or will I ever.
[03:19:42.987 --> 03:19:46.229]  Obama cries for first-graders in Connecticut.
[03:19:46.229 --> 03:19:51.671]  Does he cry for the first-graders in any other country to which he's shipped these assault rifles?
[03:19:51.671 --> 03:19:52.692]  Himself?
[03:19:52.692 --> 03:19:53.893]  I didn't send them there.
[03:19:53.893 --> 03:19:54.433]  How'd they get there?
[03:19:56.154 --> 03:19:56.694]  Absolutely.
[03:19:56.694 --> 03:19:58.335]  You know, gun control is people control.
[03:19:58.335 --> 03:19:59.455]  You're not gonna control us.
[03:19:59.455 --> 03:20:00.075]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:00.075 --> 03:20:00.855]  We're gonna go to our callers.
[03:20:00.855 --> 03:20:05.536]  This announcement is for every man tired of waking up multiple times a night to use the bathroom.

[03:24:16.349 --> 03:24:20.473]  We just got a new shipment of Super Female Vitality.

[03:24:47.517 --> 03:24:52.741]  Again, that's available exclusively at Infowarestore.com and a limited first run.
[03:24:52.741 --> 03:24:55.083]  That's the all-new ProPure shower filter.
[03:24:55.603 --> 03:24:56.585]  Let's go to our callers now.
[03:24:56.585 --> 03:24:58.809]  We've got Antoine who's been holding for quite a while.
[03:24:58.809 --> 03:25:00.994]  Antoine, you want to talk about Donald Trump?
[03:25:00.994 --> 03:25:01.715]  Ron Paul, I think?
[03:25:01.715 --> 03:25:01.956]  Go ahead.
[03:25:03.402 --> 03:25:04.363]  Yeah.
[03:25:04.363 --> 03:25:10.608]  So, uh, hi, uh, I wanted to talk about Senator Paul and Donald Trump.
[03:25:10.608 --> 03:25:14.151]  Uh, I think they are diluting both candidates.
[03:25:14.151 --> 03:25:17.193]  They've taken the truthers off the stage of history.
[03:25:17.193 --> 03:25:24.319]  I think that they are most afraid of the message of truth and stuff like patriotism and stuff.
[03:25:24.319 --> 03:25:25.519]  They don't like it.
[03:25:25.519 --> 03:25:29.783]  I think that, I think that Senator Paul should support the truth sometimes.
[03:25:30.223 --> 03:25:34.924]  You have to have a little enemy in you to know your weaknesses.
[03:25:34.924 --> 03:25:38.945]  And, uh... And when you say they don't support the truth, what do you mean?
[03:25:38.945 --> 03:25:42.105]  Because they don't talk openly about, let's say, 9-11, for example?
[03:25:42.105 --> 03:25:44.566]  Is that what you're talking about?
[03:25:44.566 --> 03:25:52.828]  They don't like all of the candidates on the stage who are basically talking truth-type things, bringing out stuff that they don't like.
[03:25:52.828 --> 03:25:59.349]  Even Bing Carson, when he talked about Obama's, you know, real father, you know, that sort of...
[03:26:02.169 --> 03:26:03.949]  And Rand Paul said that as much today.
[03:26:03.949 --> 03:26:08.671]  He got on Morning Joe today and said, they've been saying for months they're going to narrow the field.
[03:26:08.671 --> 03:26:12.832]  I don't think it's the job of the establishment of the Republican Party to decide who isn't in it.
[03:26:12.832 --> 03:26:15.473]  He says, I'm the one voice saying that we shouldn't make the sand glow.
[03:26:15.473 --> 03:26:20.054]  I'm the one voice saying we shouldn't be collecting all the government, shouldn't be collecting all your records.
[03:26:20.054 --> 03:26:23.335]  I'm the one voice saying we shouldn't lock up every kid for marijuana.
[03:26:23.915 --> 03:26:25.976]  And he really is the only one who is saying that.
[03:26:25.976 --> 03:26:28.277]  That's why I think it's very valuable for him to be in.
[03:26:28.277 --> 03:26:30.758]  I think that's why they don't want him in.
[03:26:30.758 --> 03:26:33.980]  That's why they excluded, if you remember, they excluded Ron Paul from several debates.
[03:26:35.020 --> 03:26:49.650]  And they also did the same thing to Gary Johnson, saying, well, Gary Johnson, two-term governor out of New Mexico, you know, he's not showing very high in these particular polls that we have picked, and those polls, many of them did not even list him as an option.
[03:26:49.650 --> 03:26:56.975]  So, it's a very, they can rig this any number of ways, and of course, I think it's very telling, the fact that we had this poll.
[03:26:57.555 --> 03:27:01.317]  That was done within the time frame that Fox News said they were going to look at polls.
[03:27:01.317 --> 03:27:09.600]  It was done by the Des Moines Register as well as Bloomberg and then they kind of held that poll for a couple of days until after the deadline for reporting it.
[03:27:09.600 --> 03:27:10.521]  I wonder what's going on.
[03:27:10.521 --> 03:27:13.622]  You think maybe Bloomberg doesn't want Rand Paul in the debate?
[03:27:13.622 --> 03:27:15.463]  You think maybe Fox News doesn't want him in?
[03:27:15.463 --> 03:27:17.244]  You think maybe the Republican Party?
[03:27:17.244 --> 03:27:18.704]  I think all of the above.
[03:27:18.704 --> 03:27:19.265]  That's my opinion.
[03:27:19.265 --> 03:27:20.025]  What do you think Antoine?
[03:27:21.753 --> 03:27:27.905]  Yeah, I think that all of them don't want him in and I think they might start, you know,
[03:27:29.173 --> 03:27:40.321]  You know, giving these other liars, I call them, more time, and giving them more opportunity to dilute the truth, cut them off, and be rude.
[03:27:59.133 --> 03:28:04.917]  Once you get on the ballot, they don't allow your candidates in most cases to go into a debate.
[03:28:04.917 --> 03:28:07.298]  They typically would exclude our governor candidate.
[03:28:07.298 --> 03:28:09.259]  They always exclude the presidential candidate.
[03:28:09.259 --> 03:28:20.246]  Even though they're qualified on 50 states, they won't let them on to debate the Republicans and the Democrats because they control the process and there's many different ways they can control it.
[03:28:20.246 --> 03:28:20.867]  Thank you, Antoine.
[03:28:20.867 --> 03:28:22.428]  Let's go to Stephen in Illinois.
[03:28:22.428 --> 03:28:22.908]  Go ahead, Stephen.
[03:28:25.100 --> 03:28:35.062]  Hi, first I'd like to thank you guys for waking so many people up, but I will not be voting for Donald Trump.
[03:28:35.062 --> 03:28:42.564]  Either Rand Paul will get my vote, or it will go to Gary Johnson of the Libertarians.
[03:28:42.564 --> 03:28:43.664]  Yeah, I agree.
[03:28:43.664 --> 03:28:47.525]  Tell us why you wouldn't.
[03:28:47.525 --> 03:28:53.767]  Well, his statements about things like we shouldn't let Muslims into the country and
[03:28:55.197 --> 03:29:04.183]  My great-grandfather fought to free his father's homeland of Germany from the fascist rule of Hitler.
[03:29:04.183 --> 03:29:10.807]  I won't, frankly, vote for somebody who's made statements even close to what Trump has said.
[03:29:11.673 --> 03:29:12.333]  Yeah, I understand.
[03:29:12.333 --> 03:29:12.713]  I understand.
[03:29:12.713 --> 03:29:19.175]  He's made some very authoritarian statements and hasn't really talked a lot about fundamental liberty statements.
[03:29:19.175 --> 03:29:20.435]  So that's the concern that I have about it.
[03:29:20.435 --> 03:29:25.536]  Of course, what he said about the Muslims was that he would stop immigration until we figure out what's going on.
[03:29:25.536 --> 03:29:28.957]  He wasn't saying he'd ban them forever, but until we figure out what's going on.
[03:29:28.957 --> 03:29:30.617]  I agree with that particular policy.
[03:29:30.617 --> 03:29:35.038]  I think it's insane to bring people in from an area that we have created essentially a war.
[03:29:35.698 --> 03:29:40.460]  And we're bringing in people here and in Europe that are military age.
[03:29:40.460 --> 03:29:41.621]  We're not bringing in the kids.
[03:29:41.621 --> 03:29:43.102]  We're not bringing in the sick.
[03:29:43.102 --> 03:29:45.603]  We're bringing in military-aged men.
[03:29:45.603 --> 03:29:46.703]  That should tell you something.
[03:29:46.703 --> 03:29:47.284]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:47.284 --> 03:29:49.345]  Stay with us.
[03:29:49.345 --> 03:29:50.745]  We're on the march.
[03:29:50.745 --> 03:29:53.267]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.267 --> 03:29:55.948]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.360 --> 03:30:06.344]  The first Republican debate of 2016 is this Thursday, January 14th.
[03:30:06.344 --> 03:30:12.768]  And join the InfoWars Nightly News and Prison Planet TV once again for Political Science Theater 3K.
[03:30:12.768 --> 03:30:16.051]  The stage will be getting smaller with only six candidates making the cut.
[03:30:16.051 --> 03:30:19.353]  Maybe seven if they let John Kasich slip in through the back door.
[03:30:19.353 --> 03:30:20.514]  Coverage starts at 7 p.m.
[03:30:20.514 --> 03:30:23.957]  Central on the InfoWars Nightly News and then the debate kicks off at 8 p.m.
[03:30:23.957 --> 03:30:24.237]  Central.
[03:30:24.577 --> 03:30:28.138]  Jonas for analysis that cuts through the lies in real time.
[03:30:28.138 --> 03:30:29.859]  When's the next Democratic debate, you ask?
[03:30:29.859 --> 03:30:33.580]  Well, it's on a Sunday during the NFL playoffs, because that's when most people want to watch it.
[03:30:33.580 --> 03:30:39.022]  It does not appear that Rand Paul is going to make the cut in this primetime debate, but John Kasich is?
[03:30:39.022 --> 03:30:40.143]  What is this world coming to?
[03:30:40.523 --> 03:30:47.691]  Just a little side note here, the majority of Americans polled think that Hillary Clinton should continue to run if she is indicted under this new email scandal.
[03:30:47.691 --> 03:30:49.332]  Join us this Thursday, 7 p.m.
[03:30:49.332 --> 03:30:52.696]  Central for Political Science Theater 3K.
[03:30:52.696 --> 03:30:55.219]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:30:59.964 --> 03:31:01.205]  I want more candy!

[03:31:02.226 --> 03:31:02.466]  Why?
[03:31:02.466 --> 03:31:02.706]  Why?
[03:31:02.706 --> 03:31:02.766]  Why?
[03:31:29.804 --> 03:31:30.565]  I think so.
[03:31:59.528 --> 03:32:03.049]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:32:03.049 --> 03:32:11.290]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:32:11.290 --> 03:32:16.692]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[03:33:10.418 --> 03:33:18.809]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.809 --> 03:33:19.250]  I'm David Knight.
[03:33:19.250 --> 03:33:22.334]  We're going to go back to your phone calls in just a moment, but as we were talking
[03:33:23.095 --> 03:33:38.147]  In the last segment about Rand Paul, and I read that quote of what he said on MSNBC's Morning Joe Show this morning, saying, I'm the only one who doesn't want to make the sand go, basically saying, I'm the only one who doesn't want to get involved in all these wars.
[03:33:38.147 --> 03:33:42.751]  I'm the only one who wants to stop the government collecting all this information, violating your privacy.
[03:33:42.751 --> 03:33:46.735]  I'm the only one saying that we shouldn't lock up people for having marijuana.
[03:33:47.375 --> 03:33:48.336]  And that's true.
[03:33:48.336 --> 03:33:54.762]  And you know, he's saying it more effectively and more strongly, having his finger on the pulse, even than, I think, Gary Johnson.
[03:33:54.762 --> 03:33:59.747]  When Gary Johnson announced his candidacy, what he was saying was, well, what's his priorities?
[03:33:59.747 --> 03:34:05.353]  His priorities are to keep gay marriage and abortion legal, to do some other things.
[03:34:05.353 --> 03:34:05.994]  It's like, really?
[03:34:06.474 --> 03:34:08.255]  He didn't list the NSA there.
[03:34:08.255 --> 03:34:10.917]  He didn't list all of these different wars that we're involved in.
[03:34:10.917 --> 03:34:14.579]  And I thought, that is the weakest statement.
[03:34:14.579 --> 03:34:18.001]  Not being engaged with the current issues that are going on.
[03:34:18.001 --> 03:34:27.126]  And beyond that, what Rand Paul didn't say here is he understands that it's the unelected, unaccountable bureaucracy that is totally out of control.
[03:34:27.126 --> 03:34:28.147]  It's the true government.
[03:34:28.587 --> 03:34:31.450]  It is the real government in Washington.
[03:34:31.450 --> 03:34:44.341]  These bureaucracies that continually expand their reach into our lives, that create the laws and then prosecute and persecute people with excessive fines, adjudicate whether or not you are guilty with their own people.
[03:34:44.341 --> 03:34:48.724]  He has recognized that and he has pushed back against that with the REINS Act.
[03:34:48.724 --> 03:34:51.247]  Of course, the Republicans would not support that either.
[03:34:52.059 --> 03:35:05.871]  And think about the fact that if they get Rand Paul out of here, it's going to be a completely establishment debate with the people who are left, except for Donald Trump, that they can't push out because he's so popular.
[03:35:05.871 --> 03:35:10.355]  Chris Christie, for example, he says, well, I'm evolving on guns, okay?
[03:35:10.355 --> 03:35:12.016]  He said that on this last Sunday show.
[03:35:12.016 --> 03:35:14.318]  I've gone through an evolution, okay?
[03:35:14.318 --> 03:35:15.680]  Chris Christie is evolving.
[03:35:16.300 --> 03:35:17.000]  He's evolving.
[03:35:17.000 --> 03:35:18.742]  We'll see if pigs can fly.
[03:35:18.742 --> 03:35:21.083]  But what he said was he, you know, he ran for office.
[03:35:21.083 --> 03:35:23.925]  He was a supporter of assault weapon bans.
[03:35:23.925 --> 03:35:33.491]  And when he was running for office as a supporter of assault weapon bans, Chris Christie said that opponents of assault weapon bans were radical and dangerous.
[03:35:33.491 --> 03:35:34.571]  You know what?
[03:35:34.571 --> 03:35:44.898]  I think the idea that you just go through with a redactor and take out what you don't like in the Constitution, Christie, I think that is dangerous and radical.
[03:35:45.623 --> 03:35:50.367]  And he goes on to say, you know, when these things involve public safety, I'm for public safety.
[03:35:50.367 --> 03:35:52.349]  I'm not going to just get behind the NRA.
[03:35:52.349 --> 03:35:55.191]  I'm not just going to get behind the Second Amendment.
[03:35:55.191 --> 03:35:57.133]  Safety is more important.
[03:35:57.133 --> 03:35:58.314]  No, it isn't.
[03:35:58.314 --> 03:36:01.356]  It's not more important.
[03:36:01.356 --> 03:36:02.397]  And I've said this a million times.
[03:36:02.397 --> 03:36:05.279]  Let me say it a million and one times, okay?
[03:36:05.279 --> 03:36:12.906]  When you give up your liberty to some degree, to that degree, you become a little bit of a slave, a little bit more of a slave.
[03:36:14.107 --> 03:36:17.869]  People who are slaves are never safe.
[03:36:17.869 --> 03:36:25.632]  So to the degree that you give up your liberty, you are enslaving yourself and making yourself less safe.
[03:36:25.632 --> 03:36:27.252]  There is not a trade-off.
[03:36:27.252 --> 03:36:31.494]  It is not a zero-sum game where you give up liberty and you get safety.
[03:36:31.494 --> 03:36:32.995]  That's nonsense.
[03:36:32.995 --> 03:36:34.755]  That is a fool's bargain.
[03:36:34.755 --> 03:36:36.176]  Benjamin Franklin pointed that out
[03:36:37.110 --> 03:36:37.630]  We're good to go.
[03:36:57.162 --> 03:37:07.751]  And so when you see him saying that, understand that he is channeling the same lie that is being fed to us by Debbie Wasserman Schultz, or Hillary Clinton, or Jeb Bush, or the rest of them.
[03:37:07.751 --> 03:37:09.032]  It is simply a lie.
[03:37:09.032 --> 03:37:12.174]  You will not get safer by giving up your liberty.
[03:37:12.174 --> 03:37:13.815]  Let's go back to the callers, John in New York.
[03:37:13.815 --> 03:37:14.276]  Go ahead, John.
[03:37:28.018 --> 03:37:33.201]  Rand Paul won the most straw polls of any candidate running in this race with 12.
[03:37:33.201 --> 03:37:36.242]  That's including the largest straw poll this year.
[03:37:36.242 --> 03:37:43.746]  Rand Paul is the only candidate running in the race that beat Hillary Clinton in the same five states that Obama won twice.
[03:37:43.746 --> 03:37:46.187]  None of the other candidates have.
[03:37:46.187 --> 03:37:55.011]  Rand Paul has the biggest ground game in Iowa with 130 chairs and co-chairs and over a thousand precinct captives in all 99 counties.
[03:37:55.011 --> 03:37:57.252]  That's the most of any candidate in this race.
[03:37:57.771 --> 03:37:57.891]  Yeah.
[03:38:16.863 --> 03:38:17.543]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:38:17.543 --> 03:38:20.965]  That's not any sort of representation of the entire GOP populace.
[03:38:20.965 --> 03:38:24.726]  You could toss every poll they mention on the mainstream media in the garbage.
[03:38:24.726 --> 03:38:31.609]  When actual registered voters stepped into a room to vote the real-deal straw polls, Rand Paul won 12 straw polls.
[03:38:31.609 --> 03:38:33.690]  Donald Trump won zero.
[03:38:33.690 --> 03:38:35.751]  Rand Paul's the real frontrunner in this race.
[03:38:35.751 --> 03:38:39.212]  Not Donald Trump, not Ted Cruz, not Marco Rubio.
[03:38:39.212 --> 03:38:45.235]  Rand Paul has more supporters than Christie, Kasich, Rubio, Fiorina, and Bush combined.
[03:38:46.478 --> 03:38:47.159]  I agree with you.
[03:38:47.159 --> 03:38:47.719]  I agree with you.
[03:38:47.719 --> 03:38:53.824]  I think that it's absolutely, absolutely true that they can use these polls and do use these polls.
[03:38:53.824 --> 03:38:55.385]  They use push polls.
[03:38:55.385 --> 03:39:10.017]  Everybody knows perhaps about push polls where they'll come out and they'll ask a question, maybe the day before the election, and they'll throw a hint out of some unsubstantiated charge accusing somebody of something, trying to push you in the opposite direction.
[03:39:10.017 --> 03:39:11.058]  And of course, as you mentioned,
[03:39:11.438 --> 03:39:15.543]  Picking who they're going to poll is one aspect of that.
[03:39:15.543 --> 03:39:20.468]  But let's look specifically at how they are rigging this particular game.
[03:39:20.468 --> 03:39:28.696]  They say the Des Moines Register Bloomberg Politics poll, this is Politico, that was released this morning showed Paul at 5% alone in fifth place.
[03:39:28.696 --> 03:39:33.861]  In fact, if the Des Moines Register poll was included in the list of the five most recent polls, says Politico,
[03:39:34.582 --> 03:39:39.566]  It gets Paul into a tie for 5th place with Jeb Bush at 4.2%.
[03:39:39.566 --> 03:39:43.689]  But of course they want Jeb Bush on the stage, they don't want Rand Paul on the stage.
[03:39:43.689 --> 03:39:51.655]  And so they say, look, this poll was released 36 hours after Fox gave the deadline for inclusion, but the poll was conducted
[03:39:52.635 --> 03:39:56.859]  Between January the 7th and January the 10th, which was the qualification time.
[03:39:56.859 --> 03:39:59.301]  Okay, so it's kind of a gray area, but then they point this out.
[03:39:59.301 --> 03:40:07.909]  Quite simply, had the Register and Bloomberg released their poll, which was completed Sunday, on Monday at 5.59 p.m.
[03:40:07.909 --> 03:40:13.514]  instead of on Wednesday at 6 a.m., Paul would have qualified for the main stage.
[03:40:13.514 --> 03:40:15.697]  Do you smell a skunk in that, John?
[03:40:15.697 --> 03:40:15.917]  I do.
[03:40:17.412 --> 03:40:19.793]  I mean, Bush has no supporters.
[03:40:19.793 --> 03:40:23.874]  There's no way that Rand Paul could be polling anywhere near Jeff Bush.
[03:40:23.874 --> 03:40:34.058]  Rand Paul has millions of supporters swarming everywhere online, sending emails and calling Fox nonstop to try to get him out of the debate or saying that they're going to boycott the debate.
[03:40:34.058 --> 03:40:38.200]  There's three candidates that have actual physical supporters in this race.
[03:40:38.200 --> 03:40:40.841]  Rand Paul, Donald Trump, and Bernie Sanders.
[03:40:41.445 --> 03:40:41.805]  Yeah, I agree.
[03:40:41.805 --> 03:40:42.626]  That's it.
[03:40:42.626 --> 03:40:43.346]  Well, take a look.
[03:40:43.346 --> 03:40:45.288]  What do you think about Iowa in the 2012 election cycle?
[03:40:49.138 --> 03:40:57.402]  You had the situation where we're supposed to believe that Rick Santorum won that after they changed the winner twice on that, okay?
[03:40:57.402 --> 03:41:04.204]  He was having, the day before the caucus, he went into a bar and nobody paid any attention to him.
[03:41:04.204 --> 03:41:09.827]  As a matter of fact, they told him to shut up and sit down, they were watching something, they were watching a game on the televisions in the bar.
[03:41:09.827 --> 03:41:14.088]  And we're supposed to believe that this guy ran away with the Iowa caucus?
[03:41:14.088 --> 03:41:17.470]  I mean, they rigged election and caucus, not just the polls!
[03:41:21.071 --> 03:41:34.733]  What I saw was every single kind of election fraud possible in literally every single state in Puerto Rico.
[03:41:34.733 --> 03:41:39.794]  Fraud in the primaries, fraud at the caucuses, fraud at the county, state, and national conventions.
[03:41:39.794 --> 03:41:42.475]  It had to be the most fraud in the entire history of U.S.
[03:41:42.475 --> 03:41:42.875]  elections.
[03:41:43.742 --> 03:41:46.724]  Rick Santorum had a good ground game in Iowa.
[03:41:46.724 --> 03:41:51.066]  He had 1,200 precinct captains, similar to what Rand Paul has now.
[03:41:51.066 --> 03:41:56.189]  So, you know, hopefully that's a good indication of who's going to win the popular vote.
[03:41:56.189 --> 03:41:57.770]  But we all know Ron Paul won Iowa.
[03:41:58.117 --> 03:41:59.518]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:41:59.518 --> 03:42:11.969]  I'm just looking at that, I'm looking at what happened, I think it was in Maine, where you had people who were counting the votes locally at the precincts, and then they saw how the votes were being posted at the state level, and they said, wait a minute, that's not what we called in.
[03:42:11.969 --> 03:42:17.033]  I mean, they got caught switching the votes when they tallied them up at the state level.
[03:42:17.033 --> 03:42:19.876]  I mean, as you point out, there was fraud everywhere.
[03:42:19.876 --> 03:42:24.340]  And if people haven't seen that and aren't completely disgusted with that, they need to understand that.
[03:42:24.340 --> 03:42:25.380]  And I think, quite frankly,
[03:42:26.041 --> 03:42:35.007]  The takeaway for me, in terms of trying to get involved with the election process, I'm somebody who doesn't have any faith whatsoever in it anymore.
[03:42:35.007 --> 03:42:38.469]  I believe that the ballot box has completely failed.
[03:42:38.469 --> 03:42:42.012]  I think we need to turn to the jury box, which has failed as well.
[03:42:42.572 --> 03:42:44.493]  But we can reclaim that more easily.
[03:42:44.493 --> 03:42:48.735]  That's just an educational issue and an individual backbone issue.
[03:42:48.735 --> 03:42:51.817]  One person out of 12 can stand up and stop that.
[03:42:51.817 --> 03:43:01.442]  And we could have some politicians at the, either at the state level or at the national level, that would remove some of the impediments, some of the riggings of our jury process.
[03:43:01.442 --> 03:43:05.644]  I believe that's where we need to start shutting it down, with jury nullification and with state nullification.
[03:43:05.644 --> 03:43:07.205]  I want to get some of these other callers, but thank you, John.
[03:43:07.205 --> 03:43:08.406]  That was a great call.
[03:43:08.406 --> 03:43:10.527]  Let's go to James in Washington.
[03:43:10.527 --> 03:43:10.787]  Go ahead.
[03:43:12.639 --> 03:43:13.699]  How you doing, David Knight?
[03:43:13.699 --> 03:43:14.519]  No good.
[03:43:14.519 --> 03:43:16.400]  Go ahead.
[03:43:16.400 --> 03:43:18.220]  Hey, just three quick comments.
[03:43:18.220 --> 03:43:23.762]  Trump, my lady said it best the other night, he's nothing but a repackaged neocon.
[03:43:23.762 --> 03:43:33.864]  I love his tone, I love his non-political correctness, but imminent domain, torture, spying, killing women and children, that guy's a scumbag.
[03:43:33.864 --> 03:43:34.564]  I agree.
[03:43:34.564 --> 03:43:38.665]  Grandpa, I'm tired of his candy coating, the war on terror.
[03:43:38.665 --> 03:43:41.726]  He's a great guy, he's got a great attitude, I love his spirit.
[03:43:42.549 --> 03:43:46.372]  But he's also endorsed Jeb Bush's son, George P. Bush.
[03:43:46.372 --> 03:43:47.953]  We need to confront him on that.
[03:43:47.953 --> 03:43:50.415]  We need to make sure he's straight on 9-11.
[03:43:50.415 --> 03:43:53.577]  He says Obama's funded the rebels and all that.
[03:43:53.577 --> 03:43:56.519]  Well, why can't he come out and say 9-11 was an inside job?
[03:43:56.519 --> 03:43:57.840]  And let's get straight to the point.
[03:43:57.840 --> 03:43:59.621]  I'm tired of the lies.
[03:43:59.621 --> 03:44:01.983]  Oregon, there's truth coming out down there right now.
[03:44:01.983 --> 03:44:05.806]  Archie just resigned, rumor has it.
[03:44:05.806 --> 03:44:09.228]  Judge and Sheriff are being exposed as we speak.
[03:44:09.228 --> 03:44:10.049]  Who just resigned?
[03:44:10.049 --> 03:44:10.569]  Hang on a second.
[03:44:10.569 --> 03:44:11.170]  Who just resigned?
[03:44:12.096 --> 03:44:12.676]  Who just resigned?
[03:44:12.676 --> 03:44:13.316]  Wait, no James!
[03:44:35.504 --> 03:44:36.645]  Well, hey, James, you know what?
[03:44:36.645 --> 03:44:37.906]  We were there.
[03:44:37.906 --> 03:44:40.048]  And we had scheduled interviews with Ammon Bundy.
[03:44:40.048 --> 03:44:42.470]  He repeatedly canceled those interviews.
[03:44:42.470 --> 03:44:44.731]  And so we went there to talk to him.
[03:44:44.731 --> 03:44:49.615]  And we've talked about what's going on, about the larger issue, about the Sagebrush Rebellion.
[03:44:49.615 --> 03:44:52.357]  I agree with the problems that are out there.
[03:44:52.357 --> 03:44:57.101]  We've talked about what the Congressman Greg Walden has talked about there in Oregon.
[03:44:57.101 --> 03:45:02.085]  And that's exactly what the people need to understand is what the problem is there.
[03:45:02.085 --> 03:45:02.686]  I don't agree
[03:45:03.346 --> 03:45:04.287]  We're good to go.
[03:45:33.186 --> 03:45:34.527]  Hey, how are you doing?
[03:45:56.294 --> 03:45:57.075]  Good, good.
[03:45:57.075 --> 03:46:07.282]  So, before I, you know, back it up a little bit, I'm sure that all of your viewers, even if they don't specifically agree with Rand Paul, can appreciate the view that he's bringing to the race.
[03:46:07.282 --> 03:46:19.991]  One thing he said before, give a call down to the Republican National Committee and ask them if they, you know, could sort of change the fact that they are sort of controlling who gets to be a candidate and who doesn't.
[03:46:19.991 --> 03:46:21.913]  So I'm going to give you a number right now.
[03:46:22.944 --> 03:46:25.005]  Yes, sir.
[03:46:25.005 --> 03:46:28.227]  We can't give out numbers on the phone because we don't know whose number that is.
[03:46:28.227 --> 03:46:29.527]  We can't verify that.
[03:46:29.527 --> 03:46:32.148]  But yeah, look it up, contact people, get involved.
[03:46:32.148 --> 03:46:34.550]  This is a time to scream and shout at them.
[03:46:34.550 --> 03:46:37.171]  I really do think that that matters to some degree.
[03:46:37.171 --> 03:46:43.614]  Whether or not it's going to matter if he gets into the debate, if they're going to rig the elections and the rest of the process.
[03:46:43.614 --> 03:46:47.316]  But we can at least fight, we can at least register our discontent with them.
[03:46:47.956 --> 03:46:54.366]  Now, one of the things that happened yesterday that I thought was pretty interesting was, of course, we had the Obama State of the Union.
[03:46:54.366 --> 03:47:00.175]  He said he was going to, they said it in advance, that he was going to talk about self-driving cars.
[03:47:01.209 --> 03:47:02.390]  Turned out that he didn't.
[03:47:02.390 --> 03:47:17.482]  However, tomorrow he's going to have an official with the Department of Transportation that's going to go to the trade show in Detroit and there with the other car, with car makers that are going to be in attendance there, he's going to push to streamline
[03:47:18.323 --> 03:47:22.389]  Regulations to make sure that we get self-driving cars more quickly.
[03:47:22.389 --> 03:47:32.843]  And let me tell you, as somebody who is concerned about surveillance, somebody who is concerned about government exercising more and more control over certain areas of our life,
[03:47:33.504 --> 03:47:35.845]  I am adamantly opposed to this.
[03:47:35.845 --> 03:47:38.886]  I see a lot of problems in terms of safety as well.
[03:47:38.886 --> 03:47:41.526]  Let's take a look at this video here.
[03:47:41.526 --> 03:47:43.467]  This was up on the Drudge Report.
[03:47:43.467 --> 03:47:49.349]  Dramatic video captures a driverless car doing donuts on a busy residential street.
[03:47:49.349 --> 03:47:53.910]  And of course this is happening right in front of a busy apartment, an apartment building in a busy street.
[03:47:53.910 --> 03:47:55.791]  The driver didn't know why this had happened.
[03:47:56.431 --> 03:47:58.653]  Okay, and he's got a Honda Accord.
[03:47:58.653 --> 03:48:00.314]  He says it was a mechanical error.
[03:48:00.314 --> 03:48:04.498]  If you look at that videotape, I don't believe that was one of these driverless cars.
[03:48:04.498 --> 03:48:06.459]  Now, Honda has had a driverless car.
[03:48:06.459 --> 03:48:10.182]  They announced it back in January of 2014.
[03:48:10.182 --> 03:48:13.164]  They brought it to the United States in September of 2014.
[03:48:13.164 --> 03:48:16.987]  I don't believe that that was one of their quote-unquote driverless cars.
[03:48:17.788 --> 03:48:32.712]  But, understand that if this is just an ordinary car, if it's just a mechanical car with, so there you can see the picture of it if you're watching this, if it's just an ordinary car and it has that kind of a problem, what happens when we make the car system more complex?
[03:48:32.712 --> 03:48:34.392]  When we add more electronics?
[03:48:34.392 --> 03:48:36.013]  When we add software to it?
[03:48:36.013 --> 03:48:44.115]  See, that's the problem with these so-called smart guns, is the loss of control, the problems that come about with system complexity.
[03:48:44.875 --> 03:48:52.284]  And Google is talking about its car slip-ups at the same time it's getting the White House to try to shut down regulations.
[03:48:52.284 --> 03:48:58.691]  And of course, the reason why the White House is getting involved here is because of Google and what's going on in California.
[03:48:58.691 --> 03:49:04.197]  As we talked about before, Google has had 11 accidents in six years of operating in California.
[03:49:05.228 --> 03:49:13.732]  As a result, the Department of Transportation in California said we're going to require that you have a human as a backup system and their capability to control the car.
[03:49:13.732 --> 03:49:17.594]  That means you give them a steering wheel, you give them brakes, you give them a throttle, that sort of thing.
[03:49:18.639 --> 03:49:20.340]  And Google doesn't like that.
[03:49:20.340 --> 03:49:22.861]  That's going to cramp their rollout.
[03:49:22.861 --> 03:49:34.486]  So what they did was they went to Obama in the same way that the big agriculture companies went to the federal government and said, you know what, we've got a lot of regulations that are coming up at the state and local level about GMOs.
[03:49:34.486 --> 03:49:35.366]  We don't like that.
[03:49:35.366 --> 03:49:37.728]  So we want you to shut that down nationwide.
[03:49:37.728 --> 03:49:42.830]  We want you to come up with a law out of Washington that says that states don't have the right to do that.
[03:49:43.598 --> 03:49:51.122]  Which of course is a clear violation of the 9th and 10th Amendment, if anybody's paying attention to the Constitution anymore, but that's the way these guys operate.
[03:49:51.122 --> 03:50:05.911]  If they're getting pushback against their products because people don't like them, feel that they're dangerous, threatening, then enact legislation at the state and local level, which they have a right to do, then the federal government is brought in by the big corporations to shut this down.
[03:50:06.704 --> 03:50:09.666]  Now, 11 accidents in six years.
[03:50:09.666 --> 03:50:13.948]  And as I pointed out, over 45 years, I've had one accident.
[03:50:13.948 --> 03:50:14.809]  It wasn't my fault.
[03:50:14.809 --> 03:50:18.871]  Just like these 11 accidents we're being told were not the fault of the Google cars.
[03:50:18.871 --> 03:50:26.775]  But if you extrapolate that out, that would mean that over my time of driving, I've had, I would have had 83 accidents.
[03:50:26.775 --> 03:50:29.337]  83 accidents over a lifetime of driving.
[03:50:30.157 --> 03:50:32.058]  Would you want to get in a car with me?
[03:50:32.058 --> 03:50:34.821]  I will not get in one of these cars because of that.
[03:50:34.821 --> 03:50:37.202]  And yet, it's not even that.
[03:50:37.202 --> 03:50:42.326]  They're talking about having 272 system anomalies there with Google.
[03:50:42.326 --> 03:50:46.469]  69 occasions in addition to that, where the drivers had to seize control.
[03:50:46.469 --> 03:50:49.291]  So it's well over 300, okay?
[03:50:49.291 --> 03:50:51.213]  About 350 times.
[03:50:51.213 --> 03:50:54.555]  And they said 13 of these would have resulted in an accident.
[03:50:54.555 --> 03:50:55.516]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:51:00.951 --> 03:51:02.932]  My name is Don Whiskin.
[03:51:02.932 --> 03:51:07.893]  In 1994, I lost my 62-year-old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[03:51:07.893 --> 03:51:11.894]  In 1977, my 44-year-old brother was found dead in his apartment.
[03:51:11.894 --> 03:51:13.474]  He suffered a heart attack.
[03:51:13.474 --> 03:51:17.535]  In January of 98, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed.
[03:51:17.535 --> 03:51:22.117]  21 days later, my 53-year-old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital.
[03:51:22.117 --> 03:51:22.957]  He waited too long.
[03:51:23.397 --> 03:51:26.760]  In June, that same year, I almost joined them at 42.
[03:51:26.760 --> 03:51:27.641]  What did I do?
[03:51:27.641 --> 03:51:35.108]  I took a 7-herb formula I now call Xtendibyte made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginkgo biloba, hawthorn, milk thistle, and valerian.
[03:51:35.108 --> 03:51:43.276]  Based on German studies of natural medicine, Xtendibyte is designed to clear blocked arteries, clean the toxins from your blood, and improve your immune system.
[03:51:43.536 --> 03:51:45.298]  To get your XtendoBite, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:45.298 --> 03:51:45.919]  That's 1-877-928-8822.

[03:52:53.083 --> 03:52:54.223]  Come and take it.
[03:53:00.157 --> 03:53:03.758]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?
[03:53:03.758 --> 03:53:06.119]  How would you like to never be cold again?
[03:53:06.119 --> 03:53:13.001]  This is Dale with Fortress Clothing, and I'm here to tell you, you will never be cold again with Fortress.
[03:53:13.001 --> 03:53:22.865]  If you're tired of freezing your butt off, elk hunting, sitting in a tree stand deer hunting, winter camping, fishing, ice fishing, no longer fear the cold.

[03:54:04.464 --> 03:54:08.549]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:08.549 --> 03:54:10.011]  I'm David Nye in this last segment.
[03:54:10.011 --> 03:54:20.323]  I want to go back and finish my comments on what Obama is about to do tomorrow in terms of regulation or I should say deregulation of cars that are not ready to be on our highways.
[03:54:20.763 --> 03:54:25.364]  Before I do, real quickly, I want to let you know that we have a special on Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.
[03:54:25.364 --> 03:54:31.306]  Buy one of those and get Silver Bullet at 50% off, and get a free InfoWars calendar.
[03:54:31.306 --> 03:54:33.186]  The 2016 calendar is out.
[03:54:33.186 --> 03:54:40.028]  It has specials each and every month, and this is a great way to save on Silver Bullet and get that calendar for free.
[03:54:40.028 --> 03:54:43.028]  Again, you can find that at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:54:43.028 --> 03:54:45.909]  Also, the new ProPure shower filter has arrived.
[03:54:46.249 --> 03:54:49.791]  It's available exclusively at Infowarsstore.com in a limited first run.
[03:54:49.791 --> 03:54:59.997]  It removes over 200 contaminants from shower water, including things like heavy metals, you know, the kind of stuff that the EPA just dumped into the Animas River or three states with their explosion of the gold mine, that kind of stuff.
[03:54:59.997 --> 03:55:06.181]  Pesticides, which are being put in if you're on a well, that'll get seeped into your ground supply from
[03:55:06.901 --> 03:55:09.962]  Neighboring agricultural products.
[03:55:09.962 --> 03:55:15.604]  Fluoride, which you pay to put in the water, along with chlorine, pharmaceuticals that get passed through, and odors.
[03:55:15.604 --> 03:55:18.085]  You can filter all that out with your shower filter.
[03:55:18.085 --> 03:55:23.287]  Again, that is exclusively available at infowarsstore.com in a limited first run.
[03:55:24.187 --> 03:55:29.113]  Now, going back to what was happening with Google, again, California was concerned about this.
[03:55:29.113 --> 03:55:37.523]  And if we look at what happened in terms of their quote-unquote slip-ups, this is an article which you can find on Drudge Report, system anomalies cause drivers to take the wheel 272 times.
[03:55:39.798 --> 03:55:49.124]  According to their records, and they say in an additional 69 occasions, the drivers seized control from the automated systems based on their own judgment calls.
[03:55:49.124 --> 03:55:53.526]  Nevertheless, Google says the trend looks good.
[03:55:53.526 --> 03:55:54.287]  Looks good.
[03:55:54.287 --> 03:56:00.691]  They say 13 of those 69 driver-initiated disengagements would have resulted in crashes, okay?
[03:56:00.691 --> 03:56:01.191]  They've been steering.
[03:56:01.191 --> 03:56:02.512]  Let me explain something to you.
[03:56:03.012 --> 03:56:08.214]  Okay, is your iPhone working better today than it was three or four years ago when you bought it?
[03:56:08.214 --> 03:56:09.535]  Have you got an update?
[03:56:09.535 --> 03:56:11.896]  Chances are, no.
[03:56:11.896 --> 03:56:25.501]  What's going to happen to your iBuick when three or four years after you got that car, they find out that there's some problems, maybe some vulnerabilities, maybe some bugs in the system, so they put out a new one for the new iBuicks.
[03:56:25.501 --> 03:56:31.684]  And then you get an update for yours, too, because if they don't, they're going to have some liability, perhaps, in terms of safety.
[03:56:32.668 --> 03:56:34.990]  So they give you that update.
[03:56:34.990 --> 03:56:40.554]  Do you think that three-year-old iBuick is going to work as well as the new iBuick with the new software update?
[03:56:40.554 --> 03:56:42.355]  See, that's the problem with this.
[03:56:42.355 --> 03:56:43.896]  They're going to gradually get better.
[03:56:43.896 --> 03:56:49.821]  They're going to gradually get the bugs ironed out, but then you're going to start bringing them in in spades.
[03:56:49.821 --> 03:56:53.003]  We've seen that happen with every kind of electronic device.
[03:56:53.003 --> 03:56:54.144]  I've watched that personally.
[03:56:54.144 --> 03:56:55.725]  You know that from your experience.
[03:56:55.725 --> 03:56:59.668]  I mean, we see that car going around endlessly in reverse, okay?
[03:57:00.789 --> 03:57:03.591]  It's called an endless loop in software programming, okay?
[03:57:03.591 --> 03:57:09.054]  That's the real world example of an endless loop when you see that car out of control, going in circles.
[03:57:09.054 --> 03:57:23.603]  And of course, we've had Google Maps drive people who foolishly rely on Google Maps, drive them off of bridges, kill them, drive them off of cliffs, into the woods where they get stranded, over and over again.
[03:57:23.603 --> 03:57:28.326]  We've seen people, but Google Maps told me to do this, and it can't possibly be wrong.
[03:57:28.886 --> 03:57:32.011]  You need to not have blind faith in technology.
[03:57:32.011 --> 03:57:37.037]  As part of this article they say engineers also used a powerful simulator to generate scenarios.
[03:57:38.496 --> 03:57:42.600]  Let me tell you something, as somebody who's run simulations, they're no better than your models.
[03:57:42.600 --> 03:57:45.282]  That's the problem I have with climate change, okay?
[03:57:45.282 --> 03:57:47.084]  Garbage in, garbage out.
[03:57:47.084 --> 03:57:53.309]  They say this stands in contrast to the hazy variability that we accept in experienced human drivers, says Google.
[03:57:53.309 --> 03:57:56.773]  Never mind the 16-year-olds we send down the streets to learn amidst the rest of us.
[03:57:56.773 --> 03:57:57.553]  You know what?
[03:57:57.553 --> 03:58:02.518]  My 90-year-old aunt has a better driving record than the Google cars, yet
[03:58:02.978 --> 03:58:07.582]  Obama says we're going to streamline the regulation of these.
[03:58:07.582 --> 03:58:08.463]  We're going to remove this.
[03:58:08.463 --> 03:58:10.684]  We need to have a nimble, flexible approach.
[03:58:10.684 --> 03:58:14.207]  Since when do they ever want to deregulate anything?
[03:58:14.207 --> 03:58:15.408]  There's something more to this, folks.
[03:58:15.408 --> 03:58:18.891]  You need to understand they're coming to control your movements.
[03:58:18.891 --> 03:58:22.974]  They're going to tax and track everything you do and control your movements.
[03:58:22.974 --> 03:58:24.856]  Join us tonight at 7 central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:24.856 --> 03:58:25.957]  Eastern for the Nightly News.
