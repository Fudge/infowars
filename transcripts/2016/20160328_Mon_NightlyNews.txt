[00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:21.791]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:22.532]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:23.732]  It's Monday, March 28th, 2016.
[00:00:23.992 --> 00:00:26.393]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:30.054 --> 00:00:36.556]  Tonight, ISIS mocks Easter by cutting off the head of a priest.
[00:00:37.216 --> 00:00:41.457]  Then, bold thieves use a big rig to steal weapons.
[00:00:42.657 --> 00:00:47.321]  Thieves used the cab from a big rig, an 18-wheeler, to bust into this Ventura gun shop.
[00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:51.144]  It took them two tries to take the steel front down, but they did it.
[00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:54.867]  This in-store security camera shows they worked very quickly, too.
[00:00:55.047 --> 00:00:59.330]  You'll see the one guy had trouble smashing the glass cases before finally getting one to break.
[00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.733]  After that, how secure is your employment?
[00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:09.158]  And how the great American land grab could begin with a pen and a phone.
[00:01:09.898 --> 00:01:10.539]  That's next.
[00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:12.462]  I'll give Obama this.
[00:01:12.502 --> 00:01:13.043]  He's bold.
[00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:17.349]  I could never have imagined an Islamic radical sleeper cell becoming president.
[00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:19.692]  I mean, I can't believe the CIA did this.
[00:01:19.972 --> 00:01:21.514]  I can't believe our governments did this.
[00:01:21.694 --> 00:01:25.179]  But after all, that's how much they hate America and Christians and
[00:02:00.816 --> 00:02:15.001]  My fellow InfoWarriors, I am very excited to be able to announce to you the introduction at InfoWarsLife.com of a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsLife formulations like Survival Shield X2 and Super Mel Vitality.

[00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.850]  Today there were shots fired at the U.S.
[00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:05.670]  Capitol building.
[00:03:06.211 --> 00:03:12.354]  The area was locked down after reports of a shooting and of course one police officer was shot, but we understand that he was not seriously wounded.
[00:03:12.794 --> 00:03:15.136]  The shooter has now been apprehended.
[00:03:15.176 --> 00:03:17.877]  We're not sure what the motivation was on this.
[00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:20.179]  There's no other information about the shooter at this time.
[00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:29.424]  However, I think it's interesting to contrast this, as we're going to now see even more calls for more stringent regulation of firearms, I'm sure, especially in the D.C.
[00:03:29.464 --> 00:03:29.644]  area.
[00:03:29.844 --> 00:03:40.786]  Well, the areas where there is the most stringent gun control, where they had to even go before the Supreme Court in order to get permission for an off-duty police officer to have a firearm for his own protection.
[00:03:41.286 --> 00:03:42.266]  Take a look at this.
[00:03:42.446 --> 00:03:51.928]  Caught on tape, suspects use a big rig cab to smash through a Ventura gun store in California on a wild 48-second heist.
[00:03:51.988 --> 00:03:57.269]  Now, in 48 seconds, this guy gets about 15 guns out of the store.
[00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:15.409]  Hey, no background check, no waiting period, just steal a truck and you can get all the guns you want, which underscores the fact that no gun laws, no matter how restrictive they are on legal, law-abiding gun owners, they're not going to stop criminals from getting guns into their hands.
[00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:22.113]  Of course, yesterday was Easter Sunday, and I want to take a look at how Islamic radicals have been celebrating Easter.
[00:04:22.633 --> 00:04:30.959]  Of course, the bombing that we haven't heard nearly as much about as we did the bombing in Brussels, Belgium, is much larger, and that was in Lahore, Pakistan.
[00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:36.102]  A suicide bomb ripped through a crowd of families, killing at least 72 people.
[00:04:36.182 --> 00:04:41.886]  More than 200 others were injured, with women and children bearing the brunt of the carnage, reports The Guardian.
[00:04:42.546 --> 00:04:45.348]  Now, the context of this, of course, was Easter Sunday.
[00:04:45.908 --> 00:04:54.193]  They talk about the story of a nine-year-old boy who was living in the slums, the Christian slums of Pakistan, where they have the largest Christian populations.
[00:04:54.233 --> 00:04:58.095]  They say it was a day that was packed with family events centered around Easter.
[00:04:58.615 --> 00:05:06.880]  Part of the events that they had set up was an amusement park, a fairground ride, kind of a temporary fair that they could get into for as little as a nickel.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.163]  So there were a lot of children there, all families, with small children at that area.
[00:05:11.863 --> 00:05:14.546]  That's where the Islamists chose to strike.
[00:05:14.586 --> 00:05:20.334]  Now the comment from one of the pastors there said the government has proved it cannot keep people safe.
[00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:23.552]  Nothing will keep us safe that the government does.
[00:05:23.572 --> 00:05:26.173]  That's why we need to have the Second Amendment.
[00:05:26.634 --> 00:05:30.316]  To protect ourselves from terrorists as well as from the government.
[00:05:30.356 --> 00:05:32.197]  That was what it was originally intended for.
[00:05:32.557 --> 00:05:35.118]  Foreign invasion as well as tyrannical governments.
[00:05:35.878 --> 00:05:40.801]  They said, and this is one of the fathers there, he said, I had told my nine-year-old son not to go.
[00:05:40.881 --> 00:05:46.244]  He said, at church we have security, but in public places the government has provided nothing.
[00:05:46.624 --> 00:05:46.984]  We're good to go.
[00:06:17.047 --> 00:06:21.591]  Who had been at the line for the dodgems with his children when the bomb went off.
[00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:26.775]  They say, although he was peppered with shrapnel, his two sons escaped unscathed.
[00:06:27.055 --> 00:06:28.976]  He said, we have to learn to live with fear.
[00:06:29.477 --> 00:06:34.260]  Every time there is a religious festival, we Christians feel a looming sense of threat.
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.444]  We cannot be happy on our holy occasions, because whenever anybody is celebrating a Christian
[00:06:39.824 --> 00:06:42.968]  Holiday, that is the time when the Islamists want to attack.
[00:06:42.988 --> 00:06:48.774]  And of course this story, it was on the Drudge Report about ISIS reportedly crucifying a Catholic priest.
[00:06:48.854 --> 00:06:51.157]  Now this is a man who is 56.
[00:06:51.557 --> 00:06:54.060]  He was working at an old people's home.
[00:06:54.781 --> 00:07:00.063]  This is a charitable organization where they're taking care of old poor people.
[00:07:00.143 --> 00:07:02.524]  So what would Islamicist gunmen do?
[00:07:02.584 --> 00:07:04.325]  They would attack and kill people.
[00:07:04.685 --> 00:07:07.206]  They killed at least 15 people back on March 4th.
[00:07:07.506 --> 00:07:09.147]  They took this priest captive.
[00:07:09.467 --> 00:07:12.308]  They said they were going to crucify him on Easter.
[00:07:12.688 --> 00:07:18.471]  Now we haven't seen any reports other than the fact that an archbishop from Vienna
[00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:21.892]  ...told his congregation that the priest had been crucified.
[00:07:22.152 --> 00:07:24.293]  We don't know what he's basing that information on.
[00:07:24.893 --> 00:07:28.394]  We've not seen any videos or other independent reports of that.
[00:07:28.474 --> 00:07:32.556]  And his home church there in Bangalore had said that it had not happened.
[00:07:32.896 --> 00:07:36.557]  So we're not sure if that had happened, but they will be killing him, I'm sure, soon.
[00:07:36.997 --> 00:07:42.379]  And again, 15 people killed because they were taking care of old people in this area and they were Christians.
[00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:44.040]  That could not be tolerated.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.422]  We need to ask ourselves, what is tolerance?
[00:07:47.883 --> 00:07:49.404]  And where do we draw the lines?
[00:07:49.464 --> 00:07:56.650]  And for this I want to give you a couple of stories that I came across as I was out on the East Coast last week in North Carolina and in Georgia.
[00:07:57.776 --> 00:08:07.249]  The Atlanta Journal of Constitution reports that today, Georgia's governor, Nathan Deal, vetoed the religious liberty bill that triggered a wave of criticism from gay rights groups and business leaders.
[00:08:07.289 --> 00:08:11.254]  And of course, it was Disney, among others, that were threatening to boycott Georgia.
[00:08:12.115 --> 00:08:13.277]  Boycott Georgia.
[00:08:13.297 --> 00:08:14.358]  Well, they had their ways.
[00:08:14.378 --> 00:08:15.259]  I mean, first of all, they wouldn't
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.782]  Uh, do films there, but it wasn't just Disney, it was also Apple.
[00:08:18.822 --> 00:08:20.944]  I don't know how Apple would boycott Georgia.
[00:08:20.964 --> 00:08:24.927]  Would they not ship them iPhones that could be used by the NSA to spy on people?
[00:08:25.287 --> 00:08:30.772]  We also had Time Warner, Intel, Salesforce, all these companies were saying they were going to boycott Georgia.
[00:08:31.352 --> 00:08:34.895]  Also, you had the NFL saying, well, we're not going to hold a Super Bowl there.
[00:08:35.035 --> 00:08:43.101]  Even the NCAA hinted that it would influence the state's ability to be chosen to host championship games.
[00:08:43.301 --> 00:08:43.862]  So there you go.
[00:08:44.642 --> 00:08:52.454]  Whatever big business wants, especially the entertainment business, whatever they want, the GOP says, how high do you want us to jump?
[00:08:52.995 --> 00:08:57.402]  For the NCAA, or for Disney, Apple, Time, Warner, the rest of these large companies.
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.603]  What was this bill that was so offensive in that?
[00:09:01.163 --> 00:09:16.900]  Well, basically what it did was it drew the line on discrimination and said, you'll be free to do whatever you want to as far as your marriage or relationships go, but your celebration cannot be used to coerce another business into violating their religious beliefs.
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.563]  To me, that seems like a reasonable place to draw the line.
[00:09:21.206 --> 00:09:24.707]  We talk about, where do my rights stop and where do yours begin?
[00:09:24.767 --> 00:09:28.368]  Well, my rights to swing my fist stop when I punch you in the nose.
[00:09:29.048 --> 00:09:45.913]  When my right to have a relationship with somebody, or more specifically, to celebrate that relationship with a marriage or some kind of a ceremony, and I force you, at the point of a gun, under the threat of a lawsuit that will destroy your business, that I force you to do something that violates your religious beliefs,
[00:09:46.673 --> 00:09:48.294]  Then I think you've crossed the line.
[00:09:48.655 --> 00:09:50.596]  And of course, I'm not the only one who believes that.
[00:09:50.636 --> 00:09:55.139]  This was Bill Clinton who signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:55.820]  Okay?
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:15.515]  It takes the same language from the Religious Freedom Act that Bill Clinton signed and applied it there in the state to stop these abusive, vindictive lawsuits that are being pursued against companies that are simply in the photography business or the cake business by the gay rights people.
[00:10:16.295 --> 00:10:20.817]  Now, the Governor Nathan Deal of Georgia is not going to be running for re-election.
[00:10:20.978 --> 00:10:28.662]  This is his last term as governor, so he doesn't have anything evidently that he cares to placate the voters with.
[00:10:28.702 --> 00:10:33.524]  But they point out in this article that he'll need many of the Republicans that are angry with him.
[00:10:33.804 --> 00:10:40.108]  He'll need those Republicans next year when he unveils his plans to, quote, revolutionize the state's education system.
[00:10:40.862 --> 00:10:46.808]  Well, I can hardly wait to see how Governor Nathan Deal is going to revolutionize the educational system.
[00:10:47.428 --> 00:10:50.471]  What could he be using the educational system for for our children?
[00:10:50.711 --> 00:10:59.560]  We'll have to wait and see, but maybe that's the good thing that can come out of this, is that people start to understand how the educational system is being used to propagandize their children.
[00:11:00.307 --> 00:11:03.850]  Let's contrast what's going on there with real intolerance.
[00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:12.657]  This article from the Mayor in the UK points out that a doctor in Saudi Arabia has been arrested for flying the gay pride rainbow flag.
[00:11:13.317 --> 00:11:15.279]  Now, he was arrested for this at his home.
[00:11:15.339 --> 00:11:17.561]  He thought simply that the flag was pretty.
[00:11:18.101 --> 00:11:23.185]  He said his children had looked online, they saw this rainbow-colored flag, they said, that's really nice.
[00:11:23.485 --> 00:11:26.447]  So he ordered it online and flew it at his house.
[00:11:26.827 --> 00:11:33.732]  And of course, the religious police, and our ally Saudi Arabia, they have religious police who patrol the streets.
[00:11:34.153 --> 00:11:36.294]  They came to his house and arrested him.
[00:11:36.695 --> 00:11:46.782]  They point out that anyone found to be committing homosexual, transgender, or cross-dressing offenses may find themselves jailed, fined, whipped, or put to death.
[00:11:47.728 --> 00:11:52.533]  Now, I think we all understand they have drawn the line in the wrong place.
[00:11:52.793 --> 00:11:54.996]  Clearly, they've drawn the line in the wrong place, and yet...
[00:11:56.087 --> 00:12:01.870]  The liberal left will defend to the death the rights of these same people.
[00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:09.833]  And calling it racist, when of course we've mentioned many times Islam is not a race, it's not simply either a religion.
[00:12:10.414 --> 00:12:13.775]  It is a religion combined with a political form of government.
[00:12:13.835 --> 00:12:14.836]  It's a theocracy.
[00:12:14.896 --> 00:12:19.138]  It's a combination of church and state, except it is church and mosque.
[00:12:19.878 --> 00:12:25.165]  The fundamentalists, those who take the Quran literally, are looking for a global caliphate.
[00:12:25.786 --> 00:12:30.914]  And that's a repudiation to their religion that they do not have a global caliphate.
[00:12:31.354 --> 00:12:35.059]  So what they're looking for is a combination of state and mosque.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.322]  And the liberals in this country either are unaware of it, or they really simply don't care.
[00:12:40.382 --> 00:12:46.924]  Perhaps the only thing that they're concerned about is the connection of church and state, not the connection of mosque and state.
[00:12:47.205 --> 00:12:52.046]  And I don't want to see that happen in this country either, because that corrupts the religion.
[00:12:52.487 --> 00:12:55.728]  But we need to understand that we're not simply talking about a religion.
[00:12:55.968 --> 00:12:58.109]  We're talking about a political movement as well.
[00:12:59.312 --> 00:13:01.152]  Take a look at what's going on in North Carolina.
[00:13:01.373 --> 00:13:06.754]  There we have transgender NC residents and civil liberty groups are now challenging a new House bill.
[00:13:06.814 --> 00:13:08.254]  Where did this House bill come from?
[00:13:08.674 --> 00:13:11.775]  This is in response to something that happened in Charlotte.
[00:13:12.595 --> 00:13:26.979]  A lawsuit was filed in federal court today, on Monday, challenging North Carolina's new law that bans local governments from passing local anti-discrimination ordinances and dictates that transgender residents use the public restrooms of their biological sex.
[00:13:27.904 --> 00:13:34.005]  Now, the ACLU responded to this and said that the law is cruel, insulting, and unconstitutional.
[00:13:34.605 --> 00:13:39.906]  So it's insulting to say that men should not be allowed in women's bathrooms.
[00:13:40.166 --> 00:13:44.627]  Of course, they say lawmakers made no attempt to cloak their actions in a veneer of neutrality.
[00:13:44.967 --> 00:13:53.388]  Instead, they openly and virulently attacked transgender people who were falsely portrayed as predatory and dangerous to others.
[00:13:53.528 --> 00:13:55.129]  Now, where would they get that idea?
[00:13:55.689 --> 00:13:56.989]  Well, perhaps they got the idea
[00:13:57.669 --> 00:14:10.102]  That it was being put forward by people who were predators and dangerous to others because the guy in Charlotte who got this ordinance passed in Charlotte, it was a response at the state level to shut down an ordinance that was enacted in Charlotte.
[00:14:10.462 --> 00:14:19.991]  The guy who got this enacted there, his name is Chad Severance Turner, the LGBT chamber president there in Charlotte, had to step down earlier this month
[00:14:20.652 --> 00:14:23.534]  Because it was learned that he was a sex offender.
[00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:35.820]  So when they say you're portraying these people as predatory and dangerous to others as sex offenders, it's like, yeah, because the guy in Charlotte who enacted this law is a sex offender.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.643]  This is the former president of Charlotte's LGBT Chamber of Commerce.
[00:14:39.963 --> 00:14:41.564]  He's on a sex offender list.
[00:14:41.624 --> 00:14:49.088]  He had been the president of the chamber, which supported the newly expanded ordinance that gave legal protection for gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender individuals.
[00:14:49.708 --> 00:14:53.491]  Okay, and then this guy was arrested back in 1998 when he was 20 years old.
[00:14:53.551 --> 00:15:00.475]  He was charged in Cherokee County, South Carolina with a lewd act committing or attempting a lewd act upon a child under 16.
[00:15:01.816 --> 00:15:10.521]  But he went on to say his conviction had not stopped him from achieving success such as becoming the president of the LGBT Chamber.
[00:15:11.302 --> 00:15:12.803]  That is precisely the problem.
[00:15:13.834 --> 00:15:15.135]  Where do we draw the line?
[00:15:15.775 --> 00:15:18.437]  Are we more concerned about political correctness?
[00:15:18.477 --> 00:15:24.661]  Are we more concerned about the hurt feelings of somebody who is a transgender individual going into a bathroom?
[00:15:25.162 --> 00:15:31.226]  Or are we concerned about protecting women by not allowing men to go into the ladies' rooms?
[00:15:31.266 --> 00:15:33.927]  Take a look at what's going on in Germany, for example.
[00:15:33.967 --> 00:15:43.334]  The Mirror in the UK reports a German train operator has announced it's introducing women- and children-only train carriages amid fears over sex attacks in the country.
[00:15:44.134 --> 00:15:50.819]  They say that Germany is still reeling a chorus from a string of sex attacks in Cologne on New Year's Eve, allegedly carried out by dozens of migrants.
[00:15:50.899 --> 00:15:54.262]  Those attacks in Cologne, there was nothing at all alleged about that.
[00:15:54.322 --> 00:15:58.525]  We have the videotapes of it, but it took a long time for the full truth to come out.
[00:15:58.985 --> 00:16:04.551]  Because the German government and the German police there in Cologne were trying to cover up what was happening.
[00:16:04.591 --> 00:16:09.716]  The fact that we had a massive number of migrants who were attacking women on New Year's Eve.
[00:16:10.016 --> 00:16:15.822]  And of course, in the UK, it has also been introduced the same idea by a Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, last year.
[00:16:16.443 --> 00:16:22.848]  ...introduced the idea of gender segregated carriages as a measure to reduce sexual harassment on public transport.
[00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:31.576]  He said, some women have raised with me a solution to the rise in assault and harassment on public transport, and that would be to introduce women-only carriages.
[00:16:32.396 --> 00:16:36.360]  But you have to understand that political correctness trumps that.
[00:16:37.182 --> 00:16:43.871]  We can't talk about the fact that we don't want to vet people coming in from war-torn areas, radical Islamists.
[00:16:44.412 --> 00:16:46.475]  If you vet them, that is racist.
[00:16:46.876 --> 00:16:47.937]  It's xenophobic.
[00:16:48.578 --> 00:16:52.504]  And yet, we will let them come in, and we will cover up their attacks on people.
[00:16:53.447 --> 00:16:57.270]  What you need to do is make sure that they don't come into the country in the first place.
[00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:03.254]  But at the very least, we need to put the concerns of women over those of the political correct left.
[00:17:03.315 --> 00:17:07.057]  Look at what Stephen Miller said on CNN as they went crazy.
[00:17:07.077 --> 00:17:11.741]  And of course, Stephen Miller is an advisor to Donald Trump, and he said this.
[00:17:11.961 --> 00:17:14.843]  He says, it's a choice the political class makes in D.C.
[00:17:14.883 --> 00:17:16.525]  in terms of what they want to focus on.
[00:17:17.285 --> 00:17:23.910]  It's a trivial issue to be debating retweets when in fact you have Americans dying every single day as a result of immigration policies.
[00:17:24.251 --> 00:17:25.852]  This is something we should be talking about.
[00:17:26.092 --> 00:17:34.819]  The fact that half a million women now in the United States are being abused by these policies and yet we cannot address that issue.
[00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:36.460]  Stay with us after a short break.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:41.784]  We're going to talk about how Obama is stealing hundreds of millions of acres of land with just a stroke of a pen.
[00:17:41.964 --> 00:17:42.525]  We'll be right back.
[00:17:52.813 --> 00:17:56.295]  The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel.
[00:17:56.375 --> 00:17:59.776]  The Fed is a sometimes very independent organization.
[00:17:59.836 --> 00:18:04.639]  What should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[00:18:04.659 --> 00:18:07.600]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:13.603]  There is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[00:18:13.823 --> 00:18:17.407]  They print our money and then loan it to us at interest.
[00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:20.430]  The IRS is their collection agency.
[00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:29.060]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else...
[00:18:30.114 --> 00:18:38.857]  ...is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[00:18:38.957 --> 00:18:44.099]  Jeff Duncan says he saw IRS special agents using semi-automatic rifles at a gun range.
[00:18:44.599 --> 00:18:48.240]  Now he wants answers to why the agency needs that type of firepower.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.401]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:18:50.481 --> 00:18:52.881]  Is it one world the central bank was in charge?
[00:18:52.962 --> 00:18:55.342]  Know your history and you will know your enemy.
[00:18:55.662 --> 00:18:56.783]  InfoWars.com
[00:19:02.073 --> 00:19:05.797]  Please take a moment to listen to what I'm about to break down very, very carefully.
[00:19:06.518 --> 00:19:14.487]  Because the information I'm about to lay out in just two minutes changed my life and changed the life of many, many people around me.
[00:19:15.008 --> 00:19:21.376]  I was a big sports enthusiast, but loved to eat like a pig when I was 10 years old, up to about 22 or so.
[00:19:22.757 --> 00:19:28.102]  And I ran six miles every other day and lifted weights almost every day and had a great physique.
[00:19:28.262 --> 00:19:34.408]  Then I got into radio and television 21 years ago and got so busy in my work, I stopped working out.
[00:19:34.568 --> 00:19:39.193]  And everything was okay for four or five years, but then suddenly I started putting on pounds every month.
[00:19:39.493 --> 00:19:43.096]  And in the next 10 years, I gained almost 100 pounds.
[00:19:46.107 --> 00:19:56.459]  Then about seven years ago, I began jogging, swimming long distances, and lifting weights again, trying to lose weight, and was only able to lose about 20 of the 98 pounds.
[00:19:56.859 --> 00:19:58.040]  I even changed my diet.
[00:19:58.281 --> 00:19:59.742]  I even increased the exercise.
[00:19:59.762 --> 00:20:00.303]  It didn't work.
[00:20:01.144 --> 00:20:06.190]  But as soon as I began to get the nutrients and compounds that I needed
[00:20:07.236 --> 00:20:08.177]  My whole life changed.
[00:20:08.798 --> 00:20:14.844]  I've gone from 200 and almost 80 pounds down to about 220 pounds or so.
[00:20:15.445 --> 00:20:16.446]  It is incredible.
[00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:24.635]  And in just the last three years, Super Male Vitality, developed by Dr. Grube for mfulworthslife.com exclusively,
[00:20:25.315 --> 00:20:32.462]  And products like the Survival Shield X2 Nascent Ionine have just done incredible things for my body.
[00:20:32.623 --> 00:20:40.090]  I work out less, even though I'm older, I've lost more weight, my muscles got stronger, my stamina, my libido, and so much more.

[00:23:04.346 --> 00:23:09.388]  Today we learned that the FBI is increasing its probe of the Clinton emails.
[00:23:09.449 --> 00:23:15.672]  We now learned that 147 FBI agents are now involved in the Clinton email investigation.
[00:23:16.112 --> 00:23:19.293]  We have reports from both the Washington Post as well as the LA Times.
[00:23:19.734 --> 00:23:24.256]  The Washington Post reports a large number of agents have been deployed to run down leads in the investigation.
[00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:28.617]  They cited a lawmaker who had been briefed by FBI Director James Comey.
[00:23:29.057 --> 00:23:37.900]  The Post also reported that the FBI has accelerated its investigation because officials want to avoid potentially announcing any action close to the November election.
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:52.844]  And that makes it all the more interesting that today we had on MSNBC, on the Joe Scarborough Show, the MSNBC's Morning Joe, we had a political consultant saying that there is a higher bar
[00:23:53.625 --> 00:23:57.315]  In order to come after a presidential candidate than there would be for other people.
[00:23:57.335 --> 00:23:58.699]  I bet you didn't realize that, did you?
[00:23:59.502 --> 00:24:03.544]  You thought that they had the same laws applied to them as everybody else.
[00:24:03.664 --> 00:24:05.284]  No, they're too big to jail.
[00:24:05.344 --> 00:24:06.445]  Listen to what he had to say.
[00:24:06.485 --> 00:24:13.328]  This is a panel discussion that was going on on Morning Joe, and this is National Journal political reporter Ron Fournier.
[00:24:13.688 --> 00:24:19.290]  He argued there should be a higher bar to bringing charges against Hillary Clinton because she's running for president.
[00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:20.310]  Here's what he had to say.
[00:24:20.891 --> 00:24:24.512]  He said, legally there's a big bar you have to get over to prosecute anybody for these crimes.
[00:24:24.532 --> 00:24:25.833]  Well, actually that's not true.
[00:24:26.593 --> 00:24:36.879]  We've seen the national security state bring up ridiculous charges at a very low bar for all kinds of people, particularly whistleblowers and journalists.
[00:24:36.899 --> 00:24:38.540]  We've seen this happening over and over again.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:42.282]  So there's not a very high bar if you're coming after a whistleblower.
[00:24:42.842 --> 00:24:44.143]  Or if you're coming after a journalist.
[00:24:44.203 --> 00:24:59.908]  But, you know, for a politician that's extremely high bar, according to this guy, he said, I do understand that when somebody is running for president, there is a higher bar you have to get over because we can't have a system in which we're constantly charging people who are running for president of crimes.
[00:25:00.429 --> 00:25:00.989]  So there you go.
[00:25:01.869 --> 00:25:17.446]  If you committed a crime, especially a serious crime, especially a crime against the state religion of national security, because we have to understand that all of our private conversations are being collected and stored and monitored and analyzed because of national security.
[00:25:17.987 --> 00:25:21.669]  We lose our 4th and 5th Amendment protections because of national security.
[00:25:21.689 --> 00:25:22.950]  We have the TSA everywhere.
[00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:29.413]  They're soon going to be on the streets as well as the public events and their ubiquitous presence at airports.
[00:25:29.493 --> 00:25:36.797]  No, we lose all of our constitutional protections because of national security and yet when you have somebody who has violated national security
[00:25:37.677 --> 00:25:45.400]  And a far greater quantity than anybody else has, and a far greater quality than anybody else has, Hillary Clinton.
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:48.661]  And we're talking about the massive numbers of emails that she had.
[00:25:48.681 --> 00:25:53.563]  But not only that, the level of security that was violated in these emails.
[00:25:53.583 --> 00:25:54.883]  These were above top secret.
[00:25:54.903 --> 00:25:58.204]  These are emails that could have cost the lives of individuals.
[00:25:58.284 --> 00:26:00.265]  And she puts them on an unsecured server.
[00:26:01.283 --> 00:26:08.566]  Running this as one of the people in the world that would be the most targeted by foreign states as well as terrorists.
[00:26:08.966 --> 00:26:11.708]  When she does all this, she's to be given a pass.
[00:26:11.728 --> 00:26:15.449]  So if you're going to go, if you're going to break the law, break it big!
[00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:16.190]  Go big!
[00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:18.871]  Don't just do some petty bank robberies.
[00:26:18.931 --> 00:26:23.193]  Go for the whole ball of wax and you can get away with it if you run for president.
[00:26:23.593 --> 00:26:25.134]  Does that apply for third party as well?
[00:26:25.154 --> 00:26:25.514]  I don't know.
[00:26:25.954 --> 00:26:29.177]  Now, they said this remark seemed to take Joe Scarborough by surprise.
[00:26:29.217 --> 00:26:35.384]  He said, well, actually, the bar for prosecution is reckless disregard of classified information.
[00:26:36.144 --> 00:26:41.870]  And Fournier said, well, politically, there's severe questions about her judgment that voters will really have to look into.
[00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:46.575]  But legally, there's a higher bar you have to get over before you prosecute somebody who's running for president.
[00:26:46.835 --> 00:26:48.156]  That's just a fact.
[00:26:48.988 --> 00:26:51.010]  To which Joe Scarborough said, really?
[00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:52.851]  What stature is that?
[00:26:52.871 --> 00:26:57.155]  In other words, where is that in the law that there's a higher bar for people?
[00:26:57.195 --> 00:27:07.223]  And of course it was the Obama administration, the Democrat Party, that told us that the big banks that had been too big to fail were also too big to jail.
[00:27:07.263 --> 00:27:11.726]  We saw that as they laundered money for the drug cartels as well as for terrorists.
[00:27:12.707 --> 00:27:13.648]  Now take a look at
[00:27:14.861 --> 00:27:25.764]  Michael Hayden, former CIA, former NSA chief, he has waded into the political election multiple times so far, always in opposition to Trump.
[00:27:25.804 --> 00:27:31.886]  And I think that tells you something when he comes out and says, again, Clinton is better prepared than Trump is.
[00:27:31.966 --> 00:27:33.766]  He says Trump is incoherent.
[00:27:34.186 --> 00:27:35.927]  Well, Hayden isn't incoherent.
[00:27:35.987 --> 00:27:38.107]  He's just trying to muddy the waters, okay?
[00:27:38.487 --> 00:27:40.248]  This is a guy who was appointed
[00:27:40.868 --> 00:27:42.989]  To the head of the NSA by Bill Clinton.
[00:27:43.089 --> 00:27:45.951]  So don't tell me that he's not a Clinton supporter.
[00:27:45.971 --> 00:27:47.551]  Which Politico, by the way, does.
[00:27:47.812 --> 00:27:48.172]  Listen to this.
[00:27:48.192 --> 00:27:51.173]  They say, Hayden is by no means a Clinton supporter.
[00:27:51.513 --> 00:27:55.435]  Though, interestingly, he wouldn't explicitly rule out voting for her in the lineup.
[00:27:55.656 --> 00:27:55.976]  Okay?
[00:27:56.216 --> 00:27:57.456]  Now, let's understand.
[00:27:57.737 --> 00:28:00.058]  He got his first big job by Bill Clinton.
[00:28:00.799 --> 00:28:02.079]  He was appointed head of the NSA.
[00:28:02.139 --> 00:28:06.041]  Then George Bush appointed him head of the CIA.
[00:28:06.541 --> 00:28:11.303]  And it was under his CIA administration that they were doing the torturing.
[00:28:11.403 --> 00:28:12.783]  Of course, that wasn't torture.
[00:28:12.903 --> 00:28:14.444]  It was enhanced interrogation.
[00:28:14.924 --> 00:28:17.625]  And the drone assassinations weren't assassinations.
[00:28:17.685 --> 00:28:20.686]  They were just a disposition matrix that they were running through.
[00:28:21.266 --> 00:28:26.028]  These are the ways that the CIA and the NSA and people like Michael Hayden
[00:28:26.488 --> 00:28:29.955]  Who is equally comfortable with the Bushes and with the Clintons.
[00:28:30.556 --> 00:28:31.738]  That's the way they lie to you.
[00:28:32.219 --> 00:28:32.560]  Okay?
[00:28:32.801 --> 00:28:34.784]  It is a criminal family.
[00:28:35.799 --> 00:28:40.381]  Both of these families and the Democrats and the Republicans as well, the establishment.
[00:28:40.722 --> 00:28:46.845]  When you look at what else just came out today, of course, the CIA photographed detainees naked before sending them to be tortured.
[00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:57.190]  Okay, we now find that the same guy who had criticized Donald Trump about torture when Donald Trump said, well, I think that we need to do it because I think that it's effective.
[00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:00.472]  And he comes out and he doesn't say it's not effective.
[00:29:00.532 --> 00:29:03.033]  What he says is, well, that's against the law.
[00:29:03.093 --> 00:29:04.094]  We can't do that.
[00:29:04.733 --> 00:29:05.555]  Yet he did it.
[00:29:06.037 --> 00:29:13.376]  And not only did he do it when he had control of the CIA, but then he told Congress to cover up the documents to hide his crimes.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:23.503]  This is the hypocrisy of this man, and it's more evidence that Hillary Clinton is the great white hope of the establishment, Democrat and Republican.
[00:29:24.263 --> 00:29:28.624]  In this article, classified pictures showing CIA captives were bruised, blindfolded, and bound.
[00:29:28.684 --> 00:29:30.565]  It raised new questions about the U.S.'
[00:29:30.505 --> 00:29:33.566]  's willingness to use sexual humiliation on suspects.
[00:29:34.066 --> 00:29:40.528]  They say they took naked pictures of people before they sent them to their foreign partners for torture.
[00:29:40.908 --> 00:29:43.769]  See, that's the way they play the game.
[00:29:44.229 --> 00:29:45.290]  The plausible deniability.
[00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:46.550]  Well, we didn't torture them.
[00:29:47.111 --> 00:29:49.672]  We sent them to somebody else to be tortured.
[00:29:49.732 --> 00:29:55.455]  And then they call that extrajudicial rendition, which means that it's illegal.
[00:29:55.675 --> 00:29:57.116]  It's outside of the law.
[00:29:57.156 --> 00:29:58.677]  That's what extrajudicial means.
[00:29:58.737 --> 00:29:59.517]  So that's what they use.
[00:29:59.978 --> 00:30:03.760]  Extrajudicial rendition, they talk about
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:05.021]  I think?
[00:30:23.664 --> 00:30:28.728]  ...made their decision in places like South Carolina, where all the delegates went to Donald Trump.
[00:30:29.209 --> 00:30:34.353]  And we see Ted Cruz, the Bush surrogate now, moving in there and taking those delegates.
[00:30:34.773 --> 00:30:37.855]  He's not stealing the election from Donald Trump.
[00:30:38.496 --> 00:30:41.278]  He's stealing the election from the American voters.
[00:30:41.959 --> 00:30:51.647]  Understand that if Ted Cruz were to go in with some Bush operatives, and if they were to cart off box loads of ballots, that would be a crime.
[00:30:52.537 --> 00:30:54.998]  And that's precisely what they are going to do.
[00:30:55.018 --> 00:31:04.943]  They're going to cartload off millions of voters by going into areas where he didn't win a single delegate and turning it into a cruise state at the convention.
[00:31:05.504 --> 00:31:09.326]  You know, these rhinos have gone full organized crime.
[00:31:10.066 --> 00:31:12.407]  They ought to be prosecuted under the RICO Act.
[00:31:12.487 --> 00:31:15.609]  That's the Racketeering Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act.
[00:31:16.129 --> 00:31:25.814]  Is there any better way to describe the globalist oligarch party now than a racketeering influence, a racketeer influenced and corrupt organization?
[00:31:26.154 --> 00:31:29.896]  We got the Gambino crime families that they wanted to bring down so they created this act.
[00:31:29.916 --> 00:31:30.316]  Well, you know what?
[00:31:30.356 --> 00:31:37.300]  We got the Bush and Clinton crime families and we ought to, instead of suing them on this, we ought to get a criminal prosecution going.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:37.720]  But of course,
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:41.744]  There's a higher standard for politicians than there are for the rest of us.
[00:31:42.365 --> 00:31:44.166]  And when I look at Donald Trump's
[00:31:45.185 --> 00:31:54.269]  Worldview, we now see it being criticized across the board, not just by Michael Hayden, but we see the New York Times coming out and saying, hey, this guy's insane.
[00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:56.130]  He wants to put America first.
[00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:57.450]  I mean, what could be more insane than that?
[00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:02.052]  The New York Times says in Donald Trump's worldview, America comes first, everybody else pays.
[00:32:02.593 --> 00:32:09.936]  They say that if elected, he might halt purchases of oil from Saudi Arabia and other Arab allies unless they commit ground troops to fight ISIS.
[00:32:10.496 --> 00:32:12.418]  He also said he'd be willing to withdraw U.S.
[00:32:12.458 --> 00:32:18.183]  forces from both Japan and South Korea if they didn't substantially contribute to the cost of housing and feeding these troops.
[00:32:18.763 --> 00:32:24.568]  In other words, we have been used by these global elitists, by these organized crime families, as mercenaries.
[00:32:24.908 --> 00:32:26.510]  As unpaid mercenaries.
[00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:30.513]  And when Donald Trump simply says, hey, if you're going to use us as mercenaries, you need to pay us.
[00:32:31.494 --> 00:32:32.595]  That's as far as he's gone.
[00:32:32.615 --> 00:32:39.182]  I mean, we need to not be their mercenaries, but at the very least, we need to understand how we're being used by these people.
[00:32:39.742 --> 00:32:40.203]  Stay with us.
[00:32:40.343 --> 00:32:41.164]  We'll be right back.
[00:32:41.264 --> 00:32:43.286]  Roger Stone is going to break this down further for us.
[00:33:03.539 --> 00:33:06.941]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:33:07.322 --> 00:33:14.446]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:33:15.047 --> 00:33:23.412]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:33:23.672 --> 00:33:27.775]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:33:28.095 --> 00:33:33.439]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:33:33.439 --> 00:33:34.500]  We're good to go.
[00:34:02.054 --> 00:34:16.265]  My fellow InfoWarriors, I am very excited to be able to announce to you the introduction at InfoWarsLife.com of a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsLife formulations like Survival Shield X2 and Super Metal Vitality.

[00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:07.152]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:07.413 --> 00:35:21.859]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:22.819]  We're good to go.
[00:35:43.365 --> 00:35:51.211]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:51.371 --> 00:35:56.796]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a 6-day liver detox.
[00:35:56.816 --> 00:36:00.338]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:00.518 --> 00:36:04.522]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:04.642 --> 00:36:08.545]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:08.865 --> 00:36:09.045]  I'm good.
[00:37:05.233 --> 00:37:09.974]  Headline, Roger Stone, will they cancel the election?
[00:37:10.014 --> 00:37:30.879]  Because if you steal the nominations, if you give it to Hillary, and clearly Sanders is destroying her everywhere and she's stealing it, did it in New Hampshire, you name it, and they're openly admitting that they may, even if it gets 1,200 plus delegates, take it from Trump, they may want to blow up the Republican Party and hand it to Hillary because they were always rhino operatives, but it will blow up the Democrats too.
[00:37:31.079 --> 00:37:32.480]  I predict if they steal it from Trump.
[00:37:33.288 --> 00:37:35.610]  Well, Alex, I think it remains to be seen.
[00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:39.993]  First of all, all of this talk about steak, I'm ready for a thick old porterhouse right about now.
[00:37:40.113 --> 00:37:42.655]  It was a beautiful day on the beaches in Florida this week.
[00:38:03.254 --> 00:38:06.175]  And I heard from many of my allies by cell phone.
[00:38:06.776 --> 00:38:09.177]  Make no mistake about it, the big steal is on.
[00:38:09.777 --> 00:38:12.198]  It doesn't begin in Cleveland, it's already begun.
[00:38:12.799 --> 00:38:18.261]  And as we have revealed here on Infowars.com in the past, it has two elements.
[00:38:18.662 --> 00:38:25.185]  One is to try to stall Donald Trump short of the 1237 that he needs to be nominated, an absolute majority.
[00:38:26.045 --> 00:38:30.849]  And the keystone to doing that, of course, is in the contests that lie ahead.
[00:38:31.429 --> 00:38:37.634]  Ted Cruz would need to win 87% of the delegates available of those still unchosen.
[00:38:37.654 --> 00:38:39.955]  A mathematical impossibility.
[00:38:40.396 --> 00:38:43.898]  Trump has a more realistic 527 that he needs.
[00:38:44.699 --> 00:38:50.243]  And he is leading big in states like California, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.
[00:38:51.476 --> 00:38:57.618]  Where the establishment and the kingmakers have found what they think is the weak link is Wisconsin.
[00:38:57.678 --> 00:39:10.863]  So now what you're going to see is a Paul Ryan, Scott Walker, Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney, all out assault on Trump in Wisconsin.
[00:39:11.043 --> 00:39:13.204]  Now, ironically, if you're doing a vote count,
[00:39:14.599 --> 00:39:16.660]  Trump does not have to win Wisconsin.
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:18.842]  He still has additional places to gain.
[00:39:19.322 --> 00:39:23.505]  But Wisconsin is a must-win for Ted Cruz to remain viable.
[00:39:24.806 --> 00:39:27.328]  Make no mistake about where the bosses are.
[00:39:28.168 --> 00:39:34.072]  They may be potentially and temporarily wedded to Ted Cruz.
[00:39:34.152 --> 00:39:43.759]  But at the end of the day, this convention will either be Donald Trump on the first ballot or Paul Ryan on the fourth.
[00:39:44.773 --> 00:39:50.297]  The establishment basically, they can get that opening, they will move to an open convention.
[00:39:50.357 --> 00:39:59.224]  If they can't stall Trump short, if he has the 1237, then beware the Trojan horse delegates that we've discussed.
[00:39:59.344 --> 00:40:07.111]  Those who are pledged to vote for Trump on the first ballot, but will desert him on the second ballot, but more importantly,
[00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:13.393]  We'll vote for rules and delegate seating that are harmful to Trump.
[00:40:13.573 --> 00:40:14.834]  That's the big steal.
[00:40:15.355 --> 00:40:28.685]  Right now, the bosses are packing the crucial rules and credentials committee, not with Trump people, but with hacks, with stooges, with people who will follow orders in the big steal.
[00:40:29.605 --> 00:40:33.849]  And what's amazing to me, Alex, is that the plotters plot in open.
[00:40:35.253 --> 00:40:42.494]  In the circus recently, the very hot net-based series
[00:40:44.212 --> 00:40:47.473]  You have Ed Goas, pollster for the establishment.
[00:40:47.653 --> 00:40:49.514]  Ed Rogers, fat cat lobbyist.
[00:40:49.754 --> 00:40:54.696]  Ron Kaufman, fat cat lobbyist, Republican National Committee man from Massachusetts.
[00:40:55.216 --> 00:41:03.659]  Rick Holt, lobbyist, talking about how Trump will be stopped, talking about why he must be stopped, denigrating Trump.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.661]  The plotters plot in the open.
[00:41:07.241 --> 00:41:08.501]  They plot in the open.
[00:41:09.462 --> 00:41:11.502]  And, you know, all bets are off.
[00:41:11.562 --> 00:41:12.883]  The big steal is going forward.
[00:41:14.793 --> 00:41:16.714]  The article is on InfoWars.com.
[00:41:16.834 --> 00:41:18.956]  I want it pegged to the top of our Facebook, Twitter.
[00:41:19.036 --> 00:41:23.579]  I want the listeners to get this out to everybody because you may have heard eight months ago all this from Roger Stone.
[00:41:23.619 --> 00:41:24.280]  Now it's happening.
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:27.162]  You heard about the Koch brothers' secret meetings months before they admitted it.
[00:41:27.222 --> 00:41:27.682]  They denied it.
[00:41:27.742 --> 00:41:28.282]  Now they admit it.
[00:41:28.863 --> 00:41:31.024]  You heard about Jeb before it happened.
[00:41:31.084 --> 00:41:33.566]  Now Walker will endorse Cruz and Wisconsin push.
[00:41:33.906 --> 00:41:34.967]  The big steal is on.
[00:41:35.527 --> 00:41:38.409]  This needs to get out to talk show hosts all across the country.
[00:41:38.429 --> 00:41:41.872]  It needs to get out to your friends and family to really see what's happening.
[00:41:41.892 --> 00:41:43.112]  We'll play the clip after the break.
[00:41:43.172 --> 00:41:43.593]  It's short.
[00:41:44.113 --> 00:41:52.556]  But when he, you know, supposedly won Utah, when he went, I've got Jeb Bush, I've got, he is so proud of that now.
[00:41:54.257 --> 00:41:56.958]  And people say, well, that's like an albatross around his neck.
[00:41:57.478 --> 00:41:59.659]  Jeb Bush was like pulling one or two percent the whole time.
[00:41:59.679 --> 00:42:00.359]  Everybody hates him.
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:01.420]  He doesn't care.
[00:42:02.517 --> 00:42:09.301]  And of course the reason they want to steal the election from Donald Trump is because the elitists in both parties want the globalist trade.
[00:42:09.321 --> 00:42:16.105]  They don't want, as I pointed out earlier, an America First foreign policy and they don't want an America First trade policy.
[00:42:16.185 --> 00:42:20.468]  Our trade imbalance is destroying our heritage, our land, our resources.
[00:42:20.748 --> 00:42:26.472]  And those of course are things like NAFTA, the Transatlantic, the Trans-Pacific partnerships that have been negotiated in secret.
[00:42:26.912 --> 00:42:31.114]  By these multinational corporations that are so opposed to Donald Trump.
[00:42:31.494 --> 00:42:33.415]  Here's an example of how this is going to play out.
[00:42:34.035 --> 00:42:36.696]  Saudi land purchases fuel debate over U.S.
[00:42:36.776 --> 00:42:37.396]  water rights.
[00:42:37.416 --> 00:42:46.500]  This is a story from the AP and they're talking about how Saudi Arabia is buying massive amounts of water in areas where there are no restrictions on well pumping.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:52.503]  For example, in Vicksburg, Arizona, as well as in California, where they can go to the Palo Verde Valley
[00:42:53.223 --> 00:42:58.605]  And get dibs on water that is flowing down to California, further downstate.
[00:42:58.685 --> 00:43:02.567]  And of course, we have massive drought conditions that are a regular issue in California.
[00:43:03.007 --> 00:43:06.128]  The area that they've chosen in California is the Palo Verde Valley.
[00:43:06.268 --> 00:43:15.512]  Now this goes back to the Gold Rush era doctrine, the mining laws that were there, where they said if you stake a claim to the Colorado River, this goes back to 1877, where you stake the claim
[00:43:17.913 --> 00:43:20.795]  ...gives you superior rights to the people who are downstream.
[00:43:20.855 --> 00:43:28.421]  So they can go to that area, and that gives them first-in-time, first-in-rights, that governs the 1,450-mile waterway.
[00:43:28.481 --> 00:43:32.123]  So they can get the water before it flows to Southern California.
[00:43:32.143 --> 00:43:35.546]  And of course, they paid $31.5 million for 1,800 acres in January after buying about 2,000 acres there last year.
[00:43:40.089 --> 00:43:41.570]  This is the way it's going to play out, folks.
[00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:56.900]  This is where the foreign multinationals are going to come in here, as well as foreign countries, and cash in the dollars that they've been collecting from us as we buy the trinkets from China that are made in China, as well as the oil from Saudi Arabia.
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.881]  Look at what China is doing here in a massive bid.
[00:43:59.341 --> 00:43:59.962]  We're good to go.
[00:44:17.515 --> 00:44:22.639]  Coming after this mainly because they've got so many American dollars that they want to get rid of.
[00:44:22.959 --> 00:44:26.181]  It is fire sale going on here in the United States.
[00:44:26.641 --> 00:44:30.824]  That's the massive imbalance of trade and the way it's going to work its way out.
[00:44:31.424 --> 00:44:37.829]  We have lost our income and we are selling the wealth in this country and now they are coming to buy up our assets.
[00:44:38.209 --> 00:44:39.150]  But it's not just there.
[00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:46.714]  We also have Obama with a stroke of a pen, taking hundreds of millions of acres of land and water.
[00:44:47.215 --> 00:44:59.683]  What he is doing is using a long forgotten law, the 1916 Antiquities Act, and saying that massive amounts of America fall under the Antiquities Act, saying that they're monuments.
[00:45:00.143 --> 00:45:05.047]  Just a couple of weeks ago, Obama designated three new quote-unquote monuments in California.
[00:45:05.488 --> 00:45:16.758]  The addition of three new monuments brings the amount of federally protected acreage added through an executive action by Obama to more than 265 million acres of land and water.
[00:45:17.198 --> 00:45:23.503]  Obama has brought more acres of land and water under federal protection than any previous administration in U.S.
[00:45:23.523 --> 00:45:23.744]  history.
[00:45:23.764 --> 00:45:24.985]  And of course, he's not buying it.
[00:45:25.345 --> 00:45:29.208]  He's just bringing it into federal control with a stroke of a pen.
[00:45:29.548 --> 00:45:35.012]  And what he's doing is, he's appealing to an act from 1906, the Antiquities Act.
[00:45:35.212 --> 00:45:38.775]  The purpose of the act was to protect Indian relics.
[00:45:39.135 --> 00:45:42.898]  And what he's doing is bringing in millions of acres of land.
[00:45:42.958 --> 00:45:45.960]  It has absolutely nothing to do with protecting Indian relics.
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:53.286]  But they're working with the Indian tribes here and in Utah to say, if we bring this in, we will let you manage it for us.
[00:45:53.366 --> 00:45:55.187]  And many of the Indians are falling for that.
[00:45:55.647 --> 00:45:58.189]  They need to take a look at what has happened in Arizona.
[00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:09.999]  There in the Tonto National Monument, which is a kind of national park, that is the area that is being given to a foreign multinational corporation by John McCain.
[00:46:10.822 --> 00:46:17.985]  Taking away an area that does have historical significance to the Apache Indians as well as religious significance to them.
[00:46:18.246 --> 00:46:24.448]  It is also an area where there are surface rights that are being used by other people as well as recreational rights.
[00:46:24.548 --> 00:46:27.130]  That is going to be turned into a massive pit.
[00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:29.952]  For a foreign copper company.
[00:46:30.332 --> 00:46:32.334]  That's the way this is going to roll out.
[00:46:32.734 --> 00:46:34.916]  Think this kind of confiscation won't affect you?
[00:46:35.436 --> 00:46:39.199]  Well, understand that property rights go across all types of property.
[00:46:39.719 --> 00:46:41.541]  And it's the principle that is the issue.
[00:46:41.561 --> 00:46:49.227]  Now when we come back, Leanne McAdoo is going to join us and she's going to talk about this in a way that maybe even millennials who don't own any property can understand.
[00:46:49.267 --> 00:46:49.687]  Stay with us.
[00:46:49.907 --> 00:46:50.488]  We'll be right back.
[00:47:02.992 --> 00:47:04.013]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.554 --> 00:47:06.837]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.117 --> 00:47:14.946]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.448]  We're good.
[00:49:05.915 --> 00:49:12.418]  And joining me to talk about more private property issues, which are a fundamental right of individuals.
[00:49:12.478 --> 00:49:14.819]  And we're not going to be free individuals, Leanne, if we don't have that.
[00:49:14.859 --> 00:49:16.060]  Joining me now is Leanne McAdoo.
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:20.262]  And of course, Leanne, as I was talking about in the last segment, Obama with a stroke of the pen.
[00:49:20.962 --> 00:49:28.105]  It's taking millions of acres, actually over 153 million acres of land and water rights from people.
[00:49:28.525 --> 00:49:36.869]  And a lot of people who don't live in the country don't have, understand these surface rights because the only property rights they think of are their homes.
[00:49:37.369 --> 00:49:44.152]  But we've got millennials who don't even have homes and they're not really paying too much attention to this, but some are beginning to think about it.
[00:49:44.192 --> 00:49:57.040]  Right, and of course when I was tweeting this article that I want to talk to you about earlier, someone sent back the 2050 plan for states like Michigan, where now they're not even including mineral rights there when you go to get the deed for your home.
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:59.222]  So they're eliminating these things altogether.
[00:49:59.662 --> 00:50:05.988]  That's across the board, because here in Texas, that happens a good bit when you buy a home, because there's so much oil and natural gas.
[00:50:06.028 --> 00:50:10.071]  The people who owned it before will take that out of the contract.
[00:50:10.111 --> 00:50:17.298]  That's something you can negotiate or decide not to buy it, but you're talking about with the 2050 plan, nobody will get that on anything.
[00:50:17.498 --> 00:50:24.183]  And so you're going to see, obviously, you know, the older generation, they might be surprised by this, but millennials, they don't even care about property rights.
[00:50:24.203 --> 00:50:26.224]  They don't even care about owning a home.
[00:50:26.524 --> 00:50:34.150]  So by the time 2050 rolls around, they're not even going to be used to ever imagining that they could have once owned the minerals underneath their property.
[00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:42.896]  And so now kind of switching gears to some other rights that we don't even think about and that we're giving away for free is our personal data.
[00:50:42.936 --> 00:50:43.116]  Yeah.
[00:50:43.776 --> 00:50:49.040]  And something that Millennials do care a lot about is... We've got data mining as a kind of rights for mining.
[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:54.543]  We're talking about the miners are being driven off of their, have their property rights, which are truly property rights.
[00:50:54.864 --> 00:50:57.345]  The mining rights, the logging rights, the grazing rights, the water rights.
[00:50:57.665 --> 00:50:59.567]  Those are property rights just like your home.
[00:51:00.007 --> 00:51:01.388]  But now we've got the data mining.
[00:51:01.428 --> 00:51:07.717]  Right, and there are companies out there making so much money off of your personal data, and we're not being compensated for it.
[00:51:08.137 --> 00:51:18.372]  And so we'll talk a little bit about this at the end of the segment, about this could be a really great solution to the economic blow that we're about to be experiencing with the automation of all of our jobs.
[00:51:18.912 --> 00:51:26.181]  Now, this article came out today talking about rampant wealth inequality in Silicon Valley could make San Francisco a ghost town.
[00:51:26.601 --> 00:51:32.928]  So what you have here is a lot of millionaires from the tech industry moving into San Francisco and they've basically
[00:51:33.769 --> 00:51:34.670]  We're good to go.
[00:51:55.066 --> 00:52:07.133]  And it's kind of amazing because they've said, okay, if you make an income of less than a quarter of a million a year, we'll give you some subsidies and housing so we can have some diversity in the neighborhood.
[00:52:07.393 --> 00:52:14.637]  So we don't want everybody to have it too homogenized with elitists there who are just the owners of these companies.
[00:52:14.978 --> 00:52:18.580]  But that's really where this is all headed, with the globalist elitists.
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:22.522]  I mean, you want to talk about a lack of income distribution.
[00:52:22.842 --> 00:52:25.043]  You want to talk about all the wealth flowing to the top?
[00:52:25.163 --> 00:52:28.203]  That's what truly is coming with automation that people don't realize.
[00:52:28.343 --> 00:52:29.724]  Oh, and nobody realizes this.
[00:52:30.084 --> 00:52:37.645]  I've got a quote here from an MIT engineer who in 2013 said, oh, robots taking over our jobs, it's not going to happen in our lifetime.
[00:52:37.905 --> 00:52:44.287]  And now we have stories where there are already thousands, hundreds of thousands of people's jobs are already being taken over by robots.
[00:52:44.767 --> 00:52:48.628]  So, and this is just the beginning, and these are, you know, beta test robots.
[00:52:48.648 --> 00:52:54.850]  These aren't even, these are just the first edition, so we have no idea what, how it's really going to be, and it seems to be spiraling pretty quickly.
[00:52:55.270 --> 00:53:01.652]  So, I mean, just to put it in perspective, one bedroom home in San Francisco, one bedroom apartment, is about $3,600 a month.
[00:53:01.672 --> 00:53:02.293]  A two bedroom is nearly $5,000.
[00:53:06.914 --> 00:53:07.114]  Well, I
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:32.103]  Do any of their sales representatives there in their stores and their shops if they want to go order some food at a restaurant?
[00:53:32.143 --> 00:53:36.244]  Because they've already got a first fully automated restaurant in San Francisco.
[00:53:36.625 --> 00:53:38.726]  The meals appear in little glass cubbies.
[00:53:39.166 --> 00:53:42.247]  The customer orders it there with an iPad at the front.
[00:53:42.887 --> 00:53:45.549]  And, you know, there's no waitstaff, no cashier.
[00:53:45.569 --> 00:53:50.211]  Of course, it brings back what we've been talking about for a long time, Alex, for a long time has said.
[00:53:50.511 --> 00:53:52.492]  The argument with the globalists and elitists is
[00:53:53.112 --> 00:53:56.134]  What do we do when we no longer need these humans?
[00:53:56.154 --> 00:53:57.515]  You know, the future does not need us.
[00:53:57.575 --> 00:53:59.476]  And of course they've been talking about that a long time.
[00:53:59.536 --> 00:54:00.156]  So what do we do?
[00:54:00.196 --> 00:54:02.418]  Do they keep us around or do they get rid of us?
[00:54:02.998 --> 00:54:04.439]  Okay, and that's really the key.
[00:54:04.779 --> 00:54:10.303]  This is something that, you know, we've seen economic displacement before in sector by sector.
[00:54:10.743 --> 00:54:17.170]  We've never seen the kind of capability that this displacement has, which is across all economic sectors at the same time.
[00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:29.342]  It's not just blue-collar workers or factory workers, but it's also service workers, and it's every level of service workers from the lowest to, in many cases, mid-level and higher management.
[00:54:29.522 --> 00:54:35.025]  Right, and actually there's another article where it talks about the legal analysts that are being replaced.
[00:54:35.166 --> 00:54:40.789]  Doctors, if you think about it, your intake nurses and things being replaced with this Watson technology.
[00:54:41.129 --> 00:54:50.115]  There's another thing called Ross, and the Ross computer does all of the research that your legal, your attorneys would normally do.
[00:54:50.515 --> 00:54:53.417]  So, 40 hours a week, they're making $350,000 a year.
[00:54:53.437 --> 00:54:59.741]  Their jobs, they don't need them anymore, because they can have this other algorithmic computer do all that work.
[00:55:00.181 --> 00:55:11.108]  Certainly, when you're looking at the transportation industry and the automated self-driving trucks, and we've also, today there was a large article about the machines that would offload the ships.
[00:55:11.128 --> 00:55:15.771]  We've already got ships that are the size, the latest one, the biggest one, is the size of the Empire State Building.
[00:55:16.031 --> 00:55:19.714]  And of course, it comes over here, filled with goods from China, goes back empty,
[00:55:20.134 --> 00:55:23.916]  Now they're going to have not even longshoremen offloading those jobs.
[00:55:23.976 --> 00:55:40.447]  There will be absolutely no American jobs in the process because they will just be picking them up off of the ships, sending them to Walmart where presumably people, if there is anybody left that has any jobs or income to go buy products, they can go to the Walmart store and pick them up and check it out themselves, I guess.
[00:55:41.107 --> 00:55:51.232]  Well, and that's the thing that a lot of people don't understand is that, great, you're going to automate your fast food restaurants, but the people that typically go to these fast food restaurants are your lower income families.
[00:55:51.252 --> 00:55:52.233]  They're not catering to the 1%.
[00:55:53.234 --> 00:55:58.376]  So you're basically making your customers obsolete by automating all of their jobs.
[00:55:58.756 --> 00:56:04.560]  But this article out of Tech Insider talks about a lot of people who make over $350,000 a year are going to get replaced by software.
[00:56:07.341 --> 00:56:14.063]  So it's not just doctors and some legal people as well, but it's also finance employees.
[00:56:14.464 --> 00:56:19.385]  They're also being, so Wall Street, I mean your jobs are going to be obsolete as well.
[00:56:19.405 --> 00:56:28.289]  It's broad based across all different industries and it's from top to bottom there's going to be a lot of displacement, a lot of loss of jobs with automation.
[00:56:28.609 --> 00:56:31.970]  And when I look at the transportation industry for example, I know that
[00:56:32.590 --> 00:56:38.553]  Unions, like the Teamsters unions, will be a gradual pulling in of the technology.
[00:56:39.174 --> 00:56:45.777]  And even after they've automated the driving between cities, they will still need drivers within the city, probably.
[00:56:46.117 --> 00:56:47.078]  Or they'll regulate that.
[00:56:47.178 --> 00:56:50.039]  Or the unions will come in and say, no, you're not going to get rid of our workers.
[00:56:50.059 --> 00:56:52.961]  We're going to have them setting in the cabs for whatever reason.
[00:56:53.181 --> 00:56:54.942]  But then that will eventually be phased out.
[00:56:55.302 --> 00:57:02.845]  So it's just a question of the amount of time before they phase out all the workers and transportation and shipping and all that sort of thing.
[00:57:03.285 --> 00:57:06.306]  And so some industries are pretty much going to be gone completely.
[00:57:06.806 --> 00:57:12.348]  Others, as you point out, all the way from the top to the bottom, there's going to be a lot of loss of income.
[00:57:13.049 --> 00:57:21.792]  Because your job, the requirements and skills for your job, even if you have a high-paying job, are going to be lessened by the fact that it's automated and you're not doing all the work.
[00:57:21.952 --> 00:57:26.597]  Absolutely, and we just had the first successful drone delivery to a residential area this past weekend.
[00:57:26.918 --> 00:57:33.025]  And even the programmers know that they're eventually building programs that are going to make their own jobs obsolete.
[00:57:33.065 --> 00:57:34.326]  Even programmers won't be around.
[00:57:35.367 --> 00:57:41.895]  But there is some light at the end of the tunnel here for all of you Millennials and Bernie Sanders supporters that are trying to get free education.
[00:57:42.395 --> 00:57:44.977]  What you really need to be pushing for is this solution.
[00:57:45.717 --> 00:57:46.618]  This is out of the L.A.
[00:57:46.658 --> 00:57:47.078]  Times.
[00:57:47.679 --> 00:57:49.360]  The Data Mining Royalty Fund.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:55.784]  And they say this is one way to cushion this economic blow is to reclaim something from technology that we've been giving away for free.
[00:57:56.085 --> 00:57:57.205]  Our personal data.
[00:57:57.626 --> 00:58:05.811]  Companies that sell this personal data should pay a percentage of the resulting revenue into a data mining royalty fund that would provide annual payments to U.S.
[00:58:05.831 --> 00:58:10.655]  citizens, much like the Alaska Permanent Fund distributes oil revenues to Alaskans.
[00:58:11.135 --> 00:58:17.499]  This payment scheme would start with traditional data, but of course it would extend to any future forms like our biometric data, our facial expressions.
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:27.126]  If Google and Facebook were profiting from harvesting timber, oil, gold, or any other public resource, it would be illegal and immoral for them not to pay for it.
[00:58:27.648 --> 00:58:32.692]  Of course, that presumes that they're going to be selling things to people who have jobs, okay?
[00:58:32.972 --> 00:58:39.597]  And if they don't, then it's simply going to be a controlling mechanism, which is increasingly what Facebook has become anyway.
[00:58:39.657 --> 00:58:43.300]  All of these social media sites are really data mining for the government.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:47.103]  That's what the Bernie Sanders people need to understand, as well as Republicans.
[00:58:47.143 --> 00:58:49.145]  We need to understand where this is truly headed.
[00:58:49.425 --> 00:58:51.086]  Well, that's it for tonight's Nightly News.
[00:58:51.146 --> 00:58:52.027]  Thanks for joining us.
