[00:00:20.208 --> 00:00:22.211]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.312 --> 00:00:23.574]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:27.560]  It is April 20th, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:31.638 --> 00:00:36.500]  Tonight, will an Austin gay pastor become the Tawana Brawley of cakes?
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.241]  It's the icing on the cake as he tries to make himself look like the victim of a hate slur.
[00:00:42.622 --> 00:00:46.703]  Whole Foods countersuits as in-store footage exposes the fraud.
[00:00:47.303 --> 00:00:59.147]  And felony and misdemeanor charges have now been filed against three state and city workers in Flint, Michigan, related to the Flint water crisis and the conspiracy to tamper with evidence.
[00:00:59.787 --> 00:01:09.436]  Then, in the New York primary, a Bernie voter finds he can choose Bernie over Hillary, but when it comes to selecting delegates, he's forced to choose a Hillary delegate.
[00:01:09.756 --> 00:01:10.797]  Pick one.
[00:01:11.017 --> 00:01:11.758]  Vote for one.
[00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.180]  Delegates for the National Convention.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.245]  There are six delegates for Hillary Clinton, and there are five delegates for Bernie Sanders.
[00:01:20.906 --> 00:01:23.709]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:16.755]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:18.575]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:19.976]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.376]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:26.697]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:30.558]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.759]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.139]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.300]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:03.137 --> 00:03:13.283]  It was just last night, myself and David Knight, we were sitting here and we were talking about all the politicians who are fine with sanctions and surveillance and other things on the American public, but they don't like it on themselves.
[00:03:13.523 --> 00:03:26.350]  One, case in point, is Dianne Feinstein, and it reminded me, I saw that clip, I think it was on 60 Minutes, they were talking to Feinstein, and she was saying, yeah, I was fine with them doing all these things until the surveillance came to me and then somebody actually flew a drone
[00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.492]  There's a little private drone, but a drone up to her window and it was looking at her and she wasn't okay with that.
[00:03:31.892 --> 00:03:38.195]  Well, Mrs. Feinstein and anybody else who signs these documents and legislation, I'm not fine with this document I have right here.
[00:03:38.215 --> 00:03:43.277]  It says, court troubled by surveillance excesses at the FBI and the NSA.
[00:03:43.777 --> 00:03:50.980]  In a just released court opinion, a federal court judge overseeing government surveillance programs said he was extremely concerned.
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:59.003]  About a series of incidents in which the FBI and the NSA deviated from court-approved limits on their snooping activities.
[00:03:59.503 --> 00:04:14.227]  Perhaps more disappointing than the NSA's failure to purge this information for more than four years was the government's failure to convey to the court explicitly during that time that the NSA was continuing to retain this information the judge wrote.
[00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:15.588]  And that's exactly right.
[00:04:16.008 --> 00:04:24.373]  Not only are they saying they're not getting rid of this information like they say that they are going to do, they're just pretty much lying to the court or they're lying by omission.
[00:04:24.413 --> 00:04:29.536]  They're not flat out lying, but they're just trying to kick the can down the road and hoping that people will forget about it.
[00:04:29.556 --> 00:04:33.418]  The judge is like, no, you guys aren't being forthcoming with this information.
[00:04:33.438 --> 00:04:37.280]  And that's what's very troubling, because you think about these huge data centers they have.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.022]  They have one in San Antonio, I believe one in Utah, which is the largest.
[00:04:41.583 --> 00:04:44.824]  And when you think about all this metadata and then you compare that to
[00:04:45.825 --> 00:04:47.566]  The things that they're actually supposed to stop, right?
[00:04:47.586 --> 00:04:49.566]  They're supposed to stop the terrorist attack.
[00:04:49.606 --> 00:04:53.447]  That's why we have these big data mining centers, or at least that's what they tell us.
[00:04:53.748 --> 00:05:03.251]  But you think about San Bernardino, you think about the other things that have happened here in this country, attacks on NSA centers that they could not predict with all this information.
[00:05:03.411 --> 00:05:03.691]  Why?
[00:05:04.011 --> 00:05:07.812]  Because they ingest so much information that they can't pinpoint
[00:05:08.212 --> 00:05:10.674]  Down to the people who are the actual threats.
[00:05:10.974 --> 00:05:14.316]  It's like you have a bucket of sand, right?
[00:05:14.336 --> 00:05:15.657]  And you're trying to find a grain of rice.
[00:05:15.938 --> 00:05:21.922]  Well, you can't find the grain of rice because you have so many other things in there that are distracting you from finding the grain of rice.
[00:05:21.982 --> 00:05:23.963]  It's the same thing with the information.
[00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:29.187]  And of course, they're keeping these things data-mined, cataloged in their servers.
[00:05:29.467 --> 00:05:32.009]  If you guys watch the show, I like watching true crime shows.
[00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:36.332]  You watch something like 48 Hours Mysteries or any of these other crime shows.
[00:05:36.872 --> 00:05:50.821]  Anytime the bad guy does something bad and then they want to go track back his information, they show you explicitly how they looked at their cell phone records, their emails, their Facebooks, all these other things to paint the profile of the person that they wanted to see.
[00:05:51.262 --> 00:05:54.384]  And you may say, fine, that's well and good if they're going after the bad guy.
[00:05:54.404 --> 00:06:00.768]  But you have to remember, before the guy committed the crime, they were still taking tabs on all the things in his life.
[00:06:00.808 --> 00:06:06.592]  And it's the same thing for you and I. Just be aware of that as they continue to, very unconstitutionally,
[00:06:07.232 --> 00:06:08.052]  Take your information.
[00:06:08.072 --> 00:06:11.794]  You can't just say, I want a warrant for everybody in the United States of America, and that'd be granted to you.
[00:06:11.854 --> 00:06:13.714]  No, that's not constitutional at all.
[00:06:14.174 --> 00:06:19.636]  And as we're talking about surveillance, it was the surveillance system at Whole Foods that actually saved their bacon, so to speak.
[00:06:20.096 --> 00:06:23.678]  There's an incident right here in the city of Austin where a pastor
[00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:28.561]  Had a fake claim, or at least that's what Whole Foods is saying, and I do believe they are correct.
[00:06:28.861 --> 00:06:34.605]  Basically, a guy goes to Whole Foods, he purchases a cake, he's a gay man, and that is relevant to the conversation here.
[00:06:35.126 --> 00:06:41.250]  And he says that when he gets out to the car, he realizes that there's a anti-gay slur on his cake.
[00:06:41.551 --> 00:06:44.533]  Now this immediately threw up a red flag for me and many other people.
[00:06:44.553 --> 00:06:49.477]  If you go watch the videos or the comment sections on the videos on YouTube, they note that
[00:06:50.037 --> 00:06:55.723]  This guy went out and bought a cake with lettering on it and he didn't check while he was in the store to see what the lettering was.
[00:06:56.043 --> 00:07:01.088]  It's like if you have a son named Tim, aren't you going to check in the store to make sure that your cake doesn't say John?
[00:07:01.428 --> 00:07:02.069]  Things like that.
[00:07:02.109 --> 00:07:04.771]  He didn't buy any candles or milk or anything with it.
[00:07:05.032 --> 00:07:07.074]  So there's a lot of things wrong with this from the jump.
[00:07:07.574 --> 00:07:10.136]  And also, if you watch the video of this incident,
[00:07:11.002 --> 00:07:17.345]  Or the transaction when he was checking out at the counter, you'll notice that the clerk scans the top of the cake.
[00:07:17.365 --> 00:07:29.711]  And that's very relevant because if you watch the video, when the man goes to the checkout counter at Whole Foods, the clerk scans the top of his box, the cake box, which is very relevant, as you can see right here in the footage.
[00:07:30.111 --> 00:07:37.095]  And this is interesting because by the man's own testimony, he had a tag on the bottom of the box, which is to say, if he went
[00:07:37.595 --> 00:07:44.160]  Through the checkout line, as he is saying that he did, that means he would have to flip the cake upside down and walk out the store with it.
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.581]  I'm not buying that and neither are the people at Whole Foods.
[00:07:46.601 --> 00:07:47.302]  And there's more to that.
[00:07:47.722 --> 00:07:50.884]  There's a video also of the man in his testimony.
[00:07:51.225 --> 00:07:54.347]  Long story short, Whole Foods is suing the man and his legal team.
[00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:56.608]  I hope they win every dollar they can from the guy.
[00:07:56.648 --> 00:07:57.469]  I believe they're suing him for $100,000.
[00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.992]  And this is just one of many fake, falsified reports.
[00:08:03.452 --> 00:08:10.655]  Is there real bigotry, sexism, whatever else you want to call it out there based on race or sexual orientation or religion?
[00:08:10.995 --> 00:08:11.555]  Any of these things?
[00:08:11.675 --> 00:08:12.415]  Of course there are.
[00:08:12.696 --> 00:08:15.257]  But these guys are defeating their own cause when they do stunts like this.
[00:08:15.517 --> 00:08:16.497]  And he's not the only one.
[00:08:16.517 --> 00:08:17.037]  We see this.
[00:08:17.558 --> 00:08:18.878]  Another hate crime hoax.
[00:08:19.338 --> 00:08:22.420]  And this was a student, a black student at Keene University.
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.861]  Basically, she was running around putting out all this
[00:08:26.061 --> 00:08:26.461]  I don't know.
[00:08:45.227 --> 00:08:53.250]  And while we were there, there was another student who was putting out something on social media, a black student I believe it was, saying that the Klan is coming to campus.
[00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.811]  It turned out to be a total hoax.
[00:08:55.111 --> 00:08:58.993]  It's like these guys are defeating their own purposes when they do these stunts.
[00:08:59.033 --> 00:09:07.456]  But whether it's this or, you know, the couple, the gay couple that spray painted their own garage, there's no shortage of people who are willing to just make up stories.
[00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:08.597]  It's not even like a
[00:09:09.577 --> 00:09:12.218]  Blown out of proportion, or you know, this is my view, this is your view.
[00:09:12.238 --> 00:09:16.779]  These are completely fabricated stories to help their cause, and they're just hurting it a whole lot more.
[00:09:17.099 --> 00:09:22.100]  And as we're talking about people on social media, social media can actually hurt you physically.
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:28.682]  We have this report here about people who suffer various cell phone injuries, as bizarre as that may sound to some people.
[00:09:29.382 --> 00:09:34.586]  You can get everything from tech neck to blackberry thumb to cell phone elbow.
[00:09:35.007 --> 00:09:36.368]  These are real elements.
[00:09:36.448 --> 00:09:40.111]  People have to go to doctors and get braces and all kinds of things.
[00:09:40.131 --> 00:09:43.093]  You got the tech's neck, people craning their necks.
[00:09:43.113 --> 00:09:47.376]  I'm sure you guys have seen many people like this, especially among the young people.
[00:09:47.396 --> 00:09:51.520]  They say you can also get that from wearing a backpack, cell phone pinky.
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.462]  All types of weird things.
[00:09:54.482 --> 00:09:58.344]  So just be aware of that when you use your cell phones and your electronic devices.
[00:09:58.644 --> 00:10:01.266]  Now that's some lighter news, but we still have some more hard-hitting news.
[00:10:01.706 --> 00:10:04.808]  You guys recall the situation that's going on in Flint, Michigan.
[00:10:05.608 --> 00:10:06.649]  The poison water up there.
[00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:08.010]  The poison in your tap water.
[00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.691]  Everybody said, yeah, you guys are being sensational.
[00:10:09.831 --> 00:10:10.951]  It's not sensational now.
[00:10:11.012 --> 00:10:11.392]  Now is it?
[00:10:12.552 --> 00:10:14.814]  The Michigan governor says he's going to drink
[00:10:15.154 --> 00:10:16.996]  Flint water every day for the next month.
[00:10:17.016 --> 00:10:22.020]  How they're going to make sure that he's getting his water from Flint, I don't know, but that's what he says he's going to do.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:27.304]  And now they're saying they're actually filing criminal charges against three state and city workers.
[00:10:28.145 --> 00:10:34.731]  Felony and misdemeanor charges have been issued against three state and city employees in connection to the city's water crisis.
[00:10:35.391 --> 00:10:43.694]  One is accused of tampering with evidence when he allegedly changed testing results to show that there was less lead in city water than there actually was.
[00:10:44.094 --> 00:10:47.176]  He was also charged with willful neglect of office.
[00:10:47.736 --> 00:11:03.102]  And we see others are charged with misconduct in office, conspiracy to tamper with evidence, tampering with evidence, a treatment violation of the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act, and a monitoring violation of safe drinking water.
[00:11:04.182 --> 00:11:07.904]  So, these are things that you have to be aware of, because they're not going to tell you until it's too late.
[00:11:08.404 --> 00:11:09.084]  Think about this.
[00:11:09.204 --> 00:11:12.966]  This did not make national news until after people started dying.
[00:11:13.626 --> 00:11:23.770]  There are people actively, as we see in these allegations, in these reports, trying to keep this thing under wraps, whether you can justify it by saying that maybe they're trying to stop a public panic.
[00:11:24.111 --> 00:11:28.572]  It doesn't matter if you try to put a wrap on it if, you know, young children and infants are dying.
[00:11:28.733 --> 00:11:29.473]  People need to know
[00:11:29.933 --> 00:11:30.493]  We're good to go.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.761]  Make more YouTube videos.
[00:11:48.961 --> 00:11:49.501]  Send it to us.
[00:11:49.541 --> 00:11:50.602]  Show tips at InfoWars.
[00:11:50.642 --> 00:11:54.404]  I'd love to see if they've actually cleaned up the water out there, how clean it is.
[00:11:54.444 --> 00:11:56.425]  You can use various testing supplies.
[00:11:56.445 --> 00:12:01.567]  We sell some of them here in the InfoWars shop to test your water and just let us know how it's going out there.
[00:12:02.168 --> 00:12:10.572]  And it's not just Flint that has a health crisis because it's not just the water, but everything we ingest, everything we breathe, including our air supplies.
[00:12:10.892 --> 00:12:14.334]  And if you live in the state of California, unfortunately for you, the
[00:12:14.714 --> 00:12:15.314]  Results are out.
[00:12:15.334 --> 00:12:17.515]  You have some very dirty air.
[00:12:17.535 --> 00:12:22.456]  And they say most Americans live in areas with unhealthy levels of air pollution.
[00:12:22.536 --> 00:12:33.100]  A study finds, and they say if you go out to Los Angeles, Long Beach areas, they top the list compiled by the American Lung Association for most ozone polluted areas in the nation.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.221]  You also have Bakersfield at number two and Fresno at number four.
[00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:44.673]  And they say that 8 out of 10 residents, 32 million people live in counties with unhealthy levels of ozone.
[00:12:44.713 --> 00:12:51.916]  So definitely take this into account because you see those videos, you go to China or other places and you see those people walking around with a surgical mask.
[00:12:53.016 --> 00:12:56.477]  I don't know how long it's going to be until things get that way here.
[00:12:56.537 --> 00:12:57.378]  Hopefully they won't.
[00:12:57.458 --> 00:13:03.360]  But with all the pollution out there, it's very hard to tell when or if this thing will come to an end.
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:07.642]  Now, talking about coming to an end, is this the end of Bernie Sanders?
[00:13:07.702 --> 00:13:15.967]  Now, to be fair, I'm not a Sanders supporter, but I think Bernie has been having some votes and elections and other things stolen from the guy.
[00:13:16.307 --> 00:13:21.290]  And now we see this New York voter, Bernie Sanders supporters are being forced to vote for Hillary delegates.
[00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:31.996]  Basically, I don't have time to go into the video, but if you watch the video, the guy documents how when you go to the site or you go to the voter registration page, you have to vote for Hillary or Bernie.
[00:13:32.156 --> 00:13:32.696]  Of course you do.
[00:13:32.996 --> 00:13:35.018]  But you also have to vote for six delegates.
[00:13:35.178 --> 00:13:35.458]  Six.
[00:13:35.778 --> 00:13:39.140]  Now, Bernie has a total of five delegates, which means you can vote
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.781]  For a straight ticket Bernie Sanders, you also have to vote for Hillary Clinton.
[00:13:43.061 --> 00:13:46.083]  That's the type of fraud that they're slipping under the rug, hoping that you won't notice.
[00:13:46.423 --> 00:13:47.363]  Go watch that report.
[00:13:47.643 --> 00:13:48.704]  And also, we'll end with this.
[00:13:48.724 --> 00:13:53.506]  9-11 cover-up imploding as mainstream media is forced to report on a Saudi link.
[00:13:53.906 --> 00:13:56.387]  And with more on this, we have a special report from John Bowne.
[00:13:56.427 --> 00:14:01.269]  And stay tuned right after that for more special reports right here on the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:14:16.621 --> 00:14:17.402]  How should the U.S.
[00:14:17.462 --> 00:14:19.504]  respond to such a devastation?
[00:14:19.844 --> 00:14:22.286]  Well, I think they have to respond quickly and effectively.
[00:14:22.326 --> 00:14:29.412]  They have to find out exactly what the cause was, who did it, and they have to go after these people because there is no other choice.
[00:14:34.733 --> 00:14:39.035]  Obviously, the war in Iraq is a big, fat mistake.
[00:14:39.335 --> 00:14:39.575]  Alright?
[00:14:39.895 --> 00:14:47.419]  It took Jeb Bush, took him five days before his people told him what to say, and he ultimately said it was a mistake.
[00:14:47.779 --> 00:14:52.521]  The war in Iraq, we spent two trillion dollars, thousands of lives, we don't even have it.
[00:14:52.801 --> 00:14:56.583]  Iran is taking over Iraq with the second largest oil reserves in the world.
[00:14:56.683 --> 00:14:58.664]  We have destabilized the Middle East.
[00:14:58.964 --> 00:14:59.464]  On Monday,
[00:14:59.924 --> 00:15:11.510]  The Obama administration and the State Department said the release of the papers detailing Saudi involvement in the 9-11 attacks and its support for al-Qaeda would damage U.S.
[00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:15.392]  national security and endanger citizens living abroad.
[00:15:15.672 --> 00:15:23.356]  Both the Obama and Bush administrations have refused to release the papers stored in a guarded vault beneath Washington, D.C.
[00:15:23.616 --> 00:15:26.798]  The FBI has also refused to unseal the documents.
[00:15:27.078 --> 00:15:28.879]  It needs to be classified.
[00:15:29.139 --> 00:15:38.405]  Former Director of the FBI Robert S. Mueller said in a secret meeting, the White House has threatened to veto legislation that would release the documents.
[00:15:38.805 --> 00:15:42.487]  It's difficult to imagine a scenario where the president would sign it.
[00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:46.350]  White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Monday.
[00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:50.692]  He said the bill would jeopardize international sovereignty and put the U.S.
[00:15:51.032 --> 00:15:52.653]  at a significant risk.
[00:15:52.933 --> 00:16:03.137]  Obama allies on Capitol Hill, including an unnamed Republican senator, have vowed to prevent the Senate from taking up the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act.
[00:16:03.517 --> 00:16:11.721]  The bill would remove Saudi Arabia's immunity in federal court and allow victims of the 9-11 attacks to sue the kingdom.
[00:16:11.821 --> 00:16:12.201]  Governor Bush.
[00:16:12.381 --> 00:16:12.841]  How we doing?
[00:16:12.922 --> 00:16:13.662]  Good, how you doing?
[00:16:14.542 --> 00:16:19.347]  I was wondering, would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted from the 9-11 Commission report?
[00:16:19.367 --> 00:16:20.588]  Would you be one to see those released?
[00:16:21.409 --> 00:16:22.149]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:23.751]  You got them?
[00:16:23.811 --> 00:16:25.012]  Well, hopefully we can get them.
[00:16:25.252 --> 00:16:32.539]  In order to have the bill move forward, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would need to file procedural motions.
[00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:35.462]  60 votes are required to have the bill move forward.
[00:16:36.102 --> 00:16:43.246]  After 9-11, it was clear that the Congress was going to be called upon to conduct some form of an inquiry as to what happened.
[00:16:43.927 --> 00:16:51.631]  The decision by the leadership was to combine the intelligence committees of the House and the Senate into a single body.
[00:16:51.691 --> 00:16:55.133]  For the first time in the history of the Congress, that had occurred.
[00:16:55.513 --> 00:17:10.150]  On April 10th, the former chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and co-chair of the bipartisan Joint Congressional Inquiry into the 9-11 attacks, Bob Graham, told CBS News he believes Saudi Arabia was behind the attacks.
[00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:13.313]  What I'm trying to tell you is, so what?
[00:17:14.114 --> 00:17:15.435]  We did not invent
[00:17:18.305 --> 00:17:23.807]  Graham said support came from the Saudi government, charities, and rich people in the country.
[00:17:24.087 --> 00:17:32.450]  He said that support was downplayed because of the special relationship between the United States and the Saudi Arabian Kingdom.
[00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.210]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:41.612]  For example, here's Donald Rumsfeld chomping at the bit to keep the momentum of the New World Order's tyrannical soft war moving.
[00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:03.492]  Building 7, I often hear about.
[00:18:03.532 --> 00:18:04.453]  No plane hit building 7.
[00:18:04.773 --> 00:18:06.075]  Why did building 7 come down?
[00:18:06.275 --> 00:18:07.056]  What do you tell people?
[00:18:07.256 --> 00:18:07.917]  What is building 7?
[00:18:08.938 --> 00:18:09.219]  Building 7.
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:10.941]  I have no idea.
[00:18:10.961 --> 00:18:11.682]  I've never heard that.
[00:18:13.601 --> 00:18:28.736]  We must never forget our fellow Americans that paid the ultimate price in a bid to end the American way, quarterbacked by a protected elite class now blackmailing the US government by threatening to sell off $750 billion in US assets.
[00:18:31.218 --> 00:18:43.849]  This obvious and inflated admission of guilt by the Saudis begs the question, how much are the 2,996 innocent fellow American lives that perished on 9-11-2001 worth to you?
[00:18:43.869 --> 00:18:45.911]  What's going on, Betty?
[00:18:46.212 --> 00:18:47.413]  Betty, copy me?
[00:18:49.114 --> 00:18:53.018]  Betty, are you there?
[00:18:53.398 --> 00:18:54.819]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:09.292]  There's a very important question that needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.432 --> 00:19:12.093]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.775 --> 00:19:15.756]  And to look at that threat we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.416 --> 00:19:27.183]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type 1 civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.857 --> 00:19:39.221]  You could say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.742 --> 00:19:50.126]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.781]  And merging with artificial intelligence.
[00:19:56.522 --> 00:20:01.383]  So they're trying to end humanity as if it's a good thing and create this new species.
[00:20:01.704 --> 00:20:03.064]  Talk about mad scientists.
[00:20:03.684 --> 00:20:06.205]  And there have been several new articles on this just the last few weeks.
[00:20:06.525 --> 00:20:10.927]  DARPA is testing implantable chips in soldiers' brains, is one of them.
[00:20:11.367 --> 00:20:15.048]  Another just came out in mid-April.
[00:20:15.188 --> 00:20:16.189]  Rich Americans
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.387]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.847 --> 00:20:31.937]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.413]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.873 --> 00:20:46.698]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.138 --> 00:20:47.919]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.499 --> 00:20:50.361]  In this short report, we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.997]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.638 --> 00:21:24.004]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Need Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.935]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.395 --> 00:22:04.098]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.678 --> 00:22:17.545]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.245 --> 00:22:19.766]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.226 --> 00:22:21.407]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.848 --> 00:22:23.238]  We do have that magic spark!
[00:22:24.127 --> 00:22:30.109]  But the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:46.676]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in Brain Force, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.
[00:22:47.096 --> 00:22:53.779]  Check out Brain Force today and other game-changing compounds like X2 Survival Shield at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:23:14.804 --> 00:23:23.926]  Here's the headline from Dr. Corsi, an attempted coup to fire her and to basically change the direction to put the powerful organization with great grassroots conservatives behind Ted Cruz.
[00:23:24.146 --> 00:23:33.228]  I think what happened to this important patriotic organization, what they attempted to do, the import of it goes to the character of someone who wants to be president.
[00:23:34.189 --> 00:23:40.030]  So can you break down specifically what happened in the attempted, what some have called, mugging of Eagle Forum?
[00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:42.051]  Well, the attempt
[00:23:44.386 --> 00:23:50.191]  It's to use my endorsement of Donald Trump.
[00:23:50.451 --> 00:23:51.492]  You know, he came to St.
[00:23:51.552 --> 00:23:54.755]  Louis, had a big rally, and I introduced him.
[00:23:55.296 --> 00:24:02.782]  And I met him with him before he went on stage and asked him to support the Republican platform.
[00:24:03.243 --> 00:24:05.985]  And he promised to support the Republican platform.
[00:24:06.425 --> 00:24:07.506]  And that's important to me.
[00:24:07.526 --> 00:24:09.148]  I've had a big hand in writing it.
[00:24:09.608 --> 00:24:10.409]  It's pro-life.
[00:24:11.127 --> 00:24:17.673]  It's pro-marriage, it's pro-national sovereignty, which is very important to me.
[00:24:17.693 --> 00:24:23.138]  The military is not strong enough to have a good military.
[00:24:23.418 --> 00:24:24.719]  We've got to be superior.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:31.205]  And then our enemies will respect us and our friends will rely on us.
[00:24:33.058 --> 00:24:35.080]  And anyway, he did, and so I endorsed him.
[00:24:35.421 --> 00:24:42.508]  And I guess there's about half of our people are for Cruz, and about half of them are for Trump.
[00:24:43.289 --> 00:24:47.374]  And I didn't object to the one who endorsed Cruz.
[00:24:47.474 --> 00:24:51.899]  I said, you've got free speech, you can endorse anybody you want.
[00:24:55.233 --> 00:24:57.476]  Well, I mean, I interview you every few months.
[00:24:57.776 --> 00:25:01.800]  You make really salient, central points that other pundits aren't even making.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.982]  You're obviously super sharp.
[00:25:03.382 --> 00:25:03.943]  My grandmother's 90.
[00:25:04.063 --> 00:25:05.144]  She's super sharp.
[00:25:05.444 --> 00:25:07.106]  Has a lot of wisdom that I don't have as well.
[00:25:07.727 --> 00:25:14.655]  It's just so insulting to try to, in the dead of night, you know, steal the organization from you and just claim it's because you supported Donald Trump.
[00:25:14.695 --> 00:25:15.355]  It really shows
[00:25:16.176 --> 00:25:21.058]  Well, I think they must have been, because all of this fight started when somebody came to me and gave me a list
[00:25:40.808 --> 00:25:47.893]  Of about a dozen EGLE leaders, EGLE members, who were endorsing Cruz.
[00:25:48.734 --> 00:25:53.877]  And they did it in a way that made it look like it was EGLE Forum doing it.
[00:25:54.338 --> 00:25:57.120]  But nevertheless, I decided not to say anything.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.342]  Let them do it.
[00:26:00.682 --> 00:26:01.182]  Okay.
[00:26:01.663 --> 00:26:07.267]  Unfortunately, following that, one of them made a robocall in behalf of Cruz.
[00:26:10.206 --> 00:26:12.768]  A number of them have been using it.
[00:26:12.988 --> 00:26:19.751]  I suspect that they've been letting the Clues campaign use some of my list, which they have leaked to them.
[00:26:21.252 --> 00:26:22.573]  Wow, that's bombshell.
[00:26:22.613 --> 00:26:25.274]  I hadn't heard that yet directly from Phyllis Schlafly right now.
[00:26:25.834 --> 00:26:26.495]  She's researching.
[00:26:26.535 --> 00:26:27.955]  It looks like they had a list.
[00:26:28.336 --> 00:26:29.696]  She got calls from other members.
[00:26:29.956 --> 00:26:33.278]  Yeah, and of course, the other thing they've done is to divide up my family.
[00:26:34.959 --> 00:26:38.921]  My daughter is with the group that is leading me.
[00:26:39.454 --> 00:26:40.155]  Thank you.
[00:26:57.851 --> 00:27:00.392]  He always errs on the safe side of things.
[00:27:00.632 --> 00:27:01.993]  Well, Phyllis, that's amazing.
[00:27:02.033 --> 00:27:10.396]  I mean, not just getting rid of you claiming you were old, but now your son, a long-term member, lawyer and accountant involved in an organization that's been so selfless.
[00:27:10.416 --> 00:27:13.037]  And then we've got another son they want to get rid of.
[00:27:13.417 --> 00:27:21.039]  And he's the one who's written a lot of these amicus briefs that we've filed with the Supreme Court in important cases.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.921]  And we have a very wonderful collection of these briefs.
[00:27:25.934 --> 00:27:29.196]  And you'll be interested in one of those briefs we filed.
[00:27:29.256 --> 00:27:30.717]  I don't remember which one it was.
[00:27:30.737 --> 00:27:36.139]  The ACLU filed a brief asking the court not to read Eagle Farm's brief.
[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:37.380]  I remember that.
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.242]  Tell us, getting back to the list, this is amazing.
[00:27:40.882 --> 00:27:43.723]  So people are getting robocalls.
[00:27:44.204 --> 00:27:52.428]  Somehow they did get access to some of my lists and I don't think that was very nice.
[00:27:53.359 --> 00:28:09.792]  So you took the high road, let high-level members of the Eagle Forum go out and basically ignore what your main endorsement and just in your face endorse Cruz as they were the Eagle Forum misrepresenting, and then suddenly Robo calls as if Cruz, I guess, had already thought he was running Eagle Forum.
[00:28:10.592 --> 00:28:15.856]  Are you going to formally ask them to return any list or stop using your name?
[00:28:18.498 --> 00:28:23.142]  Well, I'm trying to say that these other people are not representing Eagle Forum.
[00:28:24.801 --> 00:28:30.807]  I represent Eagle Farm, and they've tried to throw me out, but at any rate, I'm still here.
[00:28:31.668 --> 00:28:32.789]  And I intend to be here.
[00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:47.603]  I was reading Dr. Corsi, who I know has spoken to you at WorldNetDaily about kind of the chain of events, but specifically, break down for us, ma'am, if you can, and we're going to go to break and come back in five more minutes to finish up about the general election with you and your book being republished.
[00:28:49.329 --> 00:28:56.491]  If anybody wants to know why I endorsed Trump, you've got to read the book A Choice, Not an Echo.
[00:28:57.011 --> 00:28:59.591]  Because I have been fighting the Kingmakers.
[00:29:00.211 --> 00:29:11.834]  The Kingmakers are a lot of rich people who think they are appointed to designate who the Republican nominees are and who should be the President of the United States.
[00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:13.391]  And I don't think so.
[00:29:13.611 --> 00:29:16.954]  I think the grassroots are entitled to vote for the candidate of their choice.
[00:29:16.994 --> 00:29:20.157]  That's what you've said on my show for 21 years, is what you've been saying for 50 years.
[00:29:20.497 --> 00:29:23.860]  That's what you stand for, is conservative populism.
[00:29:25.682 --> 00:29:26.422]  That's correct.
[00:29:27.123 --> 00:29:30.206]  And the kingmakers have had their way.
[00:29:30.714 --> 00:29:47.339]  You know, I tell people, I've been to every Republican convention since 1952, and I was there when the late, great Senator Ernest Dirksen, one of our greatest Republican speakers, sat on the floor of the convention.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:52.861]  I've forgotten which one it was, talking about the Kingmakers then.
[00:29:54.082 --> 00:29:58.503]  We followed you before, and you led us down the road to defeat.
[00:29:59.417 --> 00:30:08.401]  Well, the Kingmakers really don't care whether the Republicans or Democrats win, just so they're people they can pay off and control.
[00:30:09.562 --> 00:30:20.247]  And we're seeing that arrogance now, where even the Republican establishment, Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, say, fine, we'll take Hillary over Donald Trump, because they just want to maintain power.
[00:30:21.468 --> 00:30:23.009]  Yes, that is correct.
[00:30:23.589 --> 00:30:27.911]  And I want the grassroots to win, and I think we've got a chance with Trump.
[00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:30.331]  That's why they're scared to death of him.
[00:30:30.631 --> 00:30:47.745]  Well, it must be that somebody who betrayed me among our own people gave some of the list to Cruz because I found that the Cruz people were calling some of our eagles and trying to line them up for food.
[00:30:48.445 --> 00:30:52.588]  Well, I did not authorize that and that's not on my plan at all.
[00:30:52.608 --> 00:30:57.212]  I think Trump is the best bet.
[00:30:57.768 --> 00:31:01.970]  Because he's the one who would really kick the kickmaker where it hurts.
[00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:08.293]  And if you read Choice, Not an Echo, you'll know why I think they're the biggest threat to our country.
[00:31:08.913 --> 00:31:16.657]  And they need to be taken out of control and not allowed to run our country.
[00:31:17.877 --> 00:31:26.421]  The people who seem to try to be taking over have a lot of talent, but it's not enough to be able to run a good
[00:31:27.117 --> 00:31:27.617]  I don't know.
[00:31:57.284 --> 00:32:00.065]  But she knew nothing about running an organization.
[00:32:00.725 --> 00:32:05.766]  And she knew nothing about politics out of her, outside of her own domain.
[00:32:06.526 --> 00:32:11.107]  And I think you gotta love politics, which is what I do.
[00:32:11.447 --> 00:32:21.769]  So to be clear, you were already moving your daughter Anne out of the succession to run the organization, and then she got mad and tried to coup?
[00:32:21.869 --> 00:32:22.909]  Is that what happened?
[00:32:24.049 --> 00:32:26.430]  That's pretty much what happened, yes.
[00:32:27.304 --> 00:32:33.888]  And she lined up with some of the people who thought they could get good jobs with Eagle 4, but they got rid of me.
[00:32:33.908 --> 00:32:37.450]  Have you talked to Anne since this happened?
[00:32:39.571 --> 00:32:44.573]  I've talked to her a few times, and she's trying to tell me she's just doing this for my benefit.
[00:32:45.354 --> 00:32:48.075]  But I don't need somebody to do something for my benefit.
[00:32:48.616 --> 00:32:51.037]  I've gotten along quite well all these years.
[00:32:52.694 --> 00:32:56.420]  Yeah, folks always try to take something away from somebody they didn't build for their benefit, fellas.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.822]  Isn't that the way Bernie operates?
[00:32:57.842 --> 00:33:00.426]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:04.753]  A lot of people ask me what is the most important
[00:33:06.286 --> 00:33:06.546]  I think?
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.
[00:33:57.342 --> 00:34:05.626]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, when products are sold out, you're unable to get them, sometimes for months, but we hold back the products for people that have already signed up for AutoShip.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:04.505 --> 00:37:11.728]  Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan has been an outspoken opponent of the anti-free speech movement taking root here in America.
[00:37:12.128 --> 00:37:19.211]  He made a return visit to the Alex Jones Show this week with a dire warning about the rising social justice warrior mob mentality.
[00:37:20.555 --> 00:37:23.177]  Once we lose free speech in this country, forget it.
[00:37:23.697 --> 00:37:24.838]  It won't matter what we think.
[00:37:24.978 --> 00:37:27.679]  On Drudge's visit, he said, look, they're coming out to free speech next year.
[00:37:27.699 --> 00:37:28.360]  This is next year.
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:34.303]  I was listening that day, and I think that was probably one of the most important moments in the history of your broadcasting.
[00:37:35.164 --> 00:37:43.609]  Because that shows you that he sees something, you see something, and together you're, it's like, you know what they call that multiplier, one times one equals a hundred.
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:54.269]  You and Drudge on even the same wavelength, even if you guys don't agree about a lot of stuff, you guys on the same wavelength, that's the power, that's the force multiplier.
[00:37:54.289 --> 00:37:55.430]  Huge amplification.
[00:37:56.011 --> 00:37:58.453]  Right, but what is the common stitch there?
[00:37:58.733 --> 00:37:59.574]  Free speech.
[00:38:00.915 --> 00:38:03.838]  Once we give up free speech in this country, it is over.
[00:38:05.441 --> 00:38:09.905]  So of course, whenever we do a big interview like this, it gets picked up by other media outlets instantly.
[00:38:10.365 --> 00:38:14.589]  Typically, they'll dissect it and try to tie people into conspiracy theorists.
[00:38:15.009 --> 00:38:20.394]  Now, of course, these outlets did use inflammatory words in order to bait people into their articles.
[00:38:20.774 --> 00:38:27.476]  Like, for instance, they all seem to have the same headline, Billy Corgan compares social justice warriors to the KKK.
[00:38:28.036 --> 00:38:31.537]  Many outlets were surprisingly fair with Corgan's take.
[00:38:32.177 --> 00:38:38.579]  Now, if Billy had talked about the threat of social justice warrior mob mentality even a year ago, he would have caught a lot of flack.
[00:38:38.919 --> 00:38:44.681]  But instead of scrutinizing everything that was said, large chunks of the conversation are actually left in verbatim.
[00:38:45.081 --> 00:38:47.364]  Like here in this Pitchfork article, for instance.
[00:38:47.784 --> 00:38:56.713]  And this allows the reader to actually decide for themselves if there might be some merit to this discussion taking place rather than just outright telling them that it's racist.
[00:38:57.454 --> 00:39:00.537]  Now it's the same with Rolling Stone, who did a particularly fair piece.
[00:39:00.958 --> 00:39:07.985]  They actually quoted some of the key points Corrigan brought up, not just those that could be spun out of context to suit some agenda.
[00:39:08.385 --> 00:39:15.010]  Is the media finally beginning to recognize the very real threat to free speech that's posed by social justice warriors?
[00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:23.695]  I mean, they've been giving them front-page splash news for the last year, but they're finally starting to see that that might not have been such a good idea.
[00:39:24.036 --> 00:39:25.597]  They're starting to see the writing on the wall.
[00:39:25.877 --> 00:39:29.159]  Just look at how free speech has been threatened in just the past few months.
[00:39:29.519 --> 00:39:34.603]  We've seen a reporter being kicked out of a safe space, sidewalk chalk
[00:39:34.943 --> 00:39:35.664]  We're good.
[00:40:04.946 --> 00:40:05.066]  Yes.
[00:40:22.654 --> 00:40:27.956]  How Alex Jones is the guy who led the 9-11 is an inside job conspiracy theorist.
[00:40:28.196 --> 00:40:32.078]  Hello, have you picked up a newspaper in the past few days?
[00:40:32.458 --> 00:40:37.340]  I think we're all going to find out just how high up in the garment the 9-11 conspiracy actually goes.
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:39.341]  But I digress.
[00:40:39.721 --> 00:40:46.204]  So, of course, these hit pieces are saying whiny Billy Corgan is just likening himself to people of color during the Civil Rights Movement.
[00:40:46.545 --> 00:40:48.125]  But that's not what he's saying at all.
[00:40:48.206 --> 00:40:56.630]  He's pointing out that if you need to use fascist tactics to hammer down your ideology, then perhaps you need to take a look in the mirror.
[00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:59.752]  The Red Guards thought they were on the right side of history, too.
[00:40:59.832 --> 00:41:01.293]  I'm sure the Stasi did as well.
[00:41:02.173 --> 00:41:05.475]  And yeah, the Klansmen probably thought their ideology
[00:41:05.835 --> 00:41:06.736]  We're good to go.
[00:41:34.858 --> 00:41:39.620]  Not a totalitarian shutdown of anything that might make someone uncomfortable.
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:47.362]  And this writer makes the argument that Donald Trump's free speech wasn't suppressed because the protesters that shut down his rally weren't agents of the state.
[00:41:47.722 --> 00:41:49.103]  But that's exactly what they are.
[00:41:49.163 --> 00:41:51.064]  That's what cultural Marxism produces.
[00:41:51.444 --> 00:41:55.425]  Little agents of the state that go out policing everyone's speech.
[00:41:56.025 --> 00:41:59.286]  And here's the problem when it comes to banning offensive speech.
[00:41:59.627 --> 00:42:00.707]  Who gets to decide
[00:42:01.187 --> 00:42:02.827]  What is offensive and what is not?
[00:42:03.188 --> 00:42:14.790]  You see in the case of Twitter it's just a merry band of social justice warriors who of course make sure any anti-feminist sites are shut down while the kill all men hashtag trends into the ether.
[00:42:15.331 --> 00:42:20.872]  Now yesterday I asked Billy Corgan what he thought about this double standard when it comes to censorship.
[00:42:22.247 --> 00:42:34.164]  You have to start by identifying that the most powerful thing in the world right now are these technocratic systems that are in place, search engines, the way we connect on these social platforms.
[00:42:35.447 --> 00:42:42.149]  Governments have either encouraged these things to come along or quickly realized that they were the new arms of control.
[00:42:43.129 --> 00:42:47.891]  And so you have to ask yourself whether your participation in these systems is actually enslaving you.
[00:42:48.471 --> 00:42:59.654]  Then you have to drill down a little further and you have to want to ask questions about if what you're doing and participating in is truly as open as it seems.
[00:43:00.925 --> 00:43:07.108]  So if Twitter, for example, is full of people of a diversity of opinions, and you feel like, hey, it's capitalist.
[00:43:07.528 --> 00:43:08.849]  It's my idea versus yours.
[00:43:08.889 --> 00:43:09.569]  Who tweets more?
[00:43:09.629 --> 00:43:10.629]  Who gets more retweets?
[00:43:10.669 --> 00:43:12.650]  Who says the right incendiary thing?
[00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:13.691]  Who does the right mean?
[00:43:13.851 --> 00:43:14.111]  Great.
[00:43:14.891 --> 00:43:15.852]  That's America.
[00:43:15.992 --> 00:43:16.172]  Great.
[00:43:16.912 --> 00:43:19.753]  And I would only argue, you know, where do you cross the line?
[00:43:20.293 --> 00:43:21.214]  And you see it all the time.
[00:43:21.314 --> 00:43:23.254]  I mean, InfoWars puts up articles.
[00:43:24.175 --> 00:43:35.699]  As somebody who's in the world, and I have to watch what I say, when you see a page that's literally, and the page is, the Facebook page is, assassinate Donald Trump, and I believe Facebook comes out and says, that doesn't violate our standards and practices.
[00:43:35.719 --> 00:43:35.839]  Yeah.
[00:43:36.199 --> 00:43:43.922]  Okay, that's where somebody like myself has to ask, is my participation in the Facebook system, and I would call it a system,
[00:43:44.722 --> 00:43:48.123]  Am I actually encouraging something which, as an American, I find offensive.
[00:43:48.844 --> 00:43:56.507]  And I also find it offensive that a business would support... You can call... I would have no problem with a page that said, Donald Trump's a racist.
[00:43:56.747 --> 00:43:59.668]  Donald Trump's a homophobe.
[00:43:59.948 --> 00:44:00.968]  Because that's just opinion.
[00:44:01.769 --> 00:44:04.910]  The minute you talk about killing someone... Sorry.
[00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:07.951]  That's where you need to step in as a business and say, I will not support that.
[00:44:09.437 --> 00:44:11.418]  So why is that okay?
[00:44:11.899 --> 00:44:17.222]  But you can imagine what page you could create on Facebook today, and there would be calls for you to never work here at InfoWars ever again.
[00:44:17.623 --> 00:44:18.183]  Right.
[00:44:18.523 --> 00:44:19.684]  That's where it gets funky.
[00:44:20.224 --> 00:44:30.872]  So you have to be sophisticated enough to look at those systems and say, is my participation encouraging something that I know deep down is intrinsically not only flawed, but counterintuitive to what I want to be part of?
[00:44:32.728 --> 00:44:36.369]  So be on the lookout for more excerpts from that interview coming next week.
[00:44:36.449 --> 00:44:45.213]  Billy Corgan delivers some illuminating commentary on the anti-free speech movement here in the United States, as well as many more bombshell topics.
[00:44:45.513 --> 00:44:47.533]  So that's coming your way in the coming days.
[00:44:47.934 --> 00:44:50.695]  I'm Leanne McAteer reporting for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:44:57.277 --> 00:45:02.099]  As a community moves towards despotism, respect is restricted to fewer people.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:13.726]  That's veteran Denver Police Officer Charles Jones IV smashing an unarmed suspect in the face six times.
[00:45:14.266 --> 00:45:18.569]  Officers accused of using excessive force on a suspect and then trying to erase the evidence.
[00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:21.290]  I'm observing what they're doing and they're assaulting me!
[00:45:21.311 --> 00:45:23.172]  I don't understand what's going on!
[00:45:23.192 --> 00:45:32.938]  A community rates low on an information scale when the press, radio, and other channels of communication are controlled by only a few people.
[00:45:33.797 --> 00:45:41.281]  Does it raise ethical questions about the use of government money to produce stories about the government that wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were produced by the government?
[00:45:41.541 --> 00:45:43.322]  How can you ask such a question?
[00:45:44.883 --> 00:45:46.644]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:45:46.664 --> 00:45:53.127]  When a competent observer looks for signs of despotism in the community, he looks beyond fine words and noble phrases.
[00:45:53.147 --> 00:46:00.771]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.
[00:46:01.869 --> 00:46:03.890]  Tonight, I'm announcing those actions.
[00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:05.311]  What I say, go.
[00:46:05.471 --> 00:46:05.831]  See?
[00:46:06.651 --> 00:46:08.072]  I'm the law around here.
[00:46:08.092 --> 00:46:13.114]  He came, you saw, he died.
[00:46:16.511 --> 00:46:24.255]  We just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:46:24.315 --> 00:46:31.258]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:46:31.719 --> 00:46:34.080]  We are trained to deceive if we have to.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.600]  You really don't have to trust me.
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:36.401]  You shouldn't trust me.
[00:46:36.441 --> 00:46:40.003]  In fact, by my actually participating in that, I will taint the news.
[00:46:40.523 --> 00:46:43.804]  In communities of this kind, despotism stands a good chance.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:51.628]  Nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[00:46:51.648 --> 00:46:52.169]  Okay, Ms.
[00:46:52.189 --> 00:46:55.173]  Hughes, well, we're gonna do everything we can to help you.
[00:46:56.855 --> 00:47:00.320]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.

[00:47:07.591 --> 00:47:09.794]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.914 --> 00:47:16.701]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:47:16.941 --> 00:47:20.225]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.245 --> 00:47:21.406]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.707 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.991]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:47:47.031 --> 00:47:53.016]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.

[00:47:55.759 --> 00:47:56.920]  And we thank you for your support.
[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:35.299 --> 00:48:37.600]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.701]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:48:41.081 --> 00:48:46.583]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the InfoWar.
[00:48:47.023 --> 00:48:53.705]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force, and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.

[00:49:00.147 --> 00:49:10.849]  It's stimulating, mind-expanding, safer to use than alcohol.
[00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:12.830]  It's the in thing.
[00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:16.191]  Such are the myths concerning marijuana,
[00:49:17.356 --> 00:49:22.119]  Myths that lull thousands of young people into experimenting with a noxious weed.
[00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:27.382]  Marijuana, the burning weed with its roots in hell.
[00:49:27.983 --> 00:49:29.504]  Should marijuana be legalized?
[00:49:29.864 --> 00:49:31.765]  We'll debate the pros and cons right now.
[00:49:32.005 --> 00:49:34.647]  Marijuana leads to doing worse things.
[00:49:34.687 --> 00:49:35.488]  That's just a fact.
[00:49:35.528 --> 00:49:36.688]  I don't care what anybody says.
[00:49:36.708 --> 00:49:43.773]  The drug war is a total failure and the federal drug war ought to be revisited and for the most part gotten rid of.
[00:49:43.993 --> 00:49:52.302]  This has corrupted our government, it has destroyed our due process, and it is withholding from people medicine that is very effective, and we need to stop it.
[00:49:52.663 --> 00:49:54.865]  We need to roll prohibition back right now.
[00:49:54.885 --> 00:50:01.973]  Marijuana is natural, you know, there's so many different things that you can use it for, including, you know, helping cancer patients.
[00:50:02.314 --> 00:50:03.235]  I'm a Christian minister.
[00:50:03.735 --> 00:50:03.915]  Yeah.
[00:50:04.156 --> 00:50:06.057]  And I believe, you know, Jesus would be okay with it.
[00:50:06.397 --> 00:50:22.972]  There have been studies proven that children who have 400 seizures a day, that's intense, that's like a seizure a minute, who can't stop just violently convulsing, have been helped and have stopped having seizures, like, two to three days after applying the cannabinoid oil treatment to themselves, like, in their food or something like that.
[00:50:23.312 --> 00:50:24.213]  Like, that's incredible.
[00:50:24.473 --> 00:50:25.534]  There's proof of that.
[00:50:25.574 --> 00:50:26.675]  Like, it's all over the internet.
[00:50:26.735 --> 00:50:36.919]  The mandatory minimums, locking people up for non-violent crimes for very long periods of time, where there's no discretion for the fact that they were non-violent, that this is their first offense.
[00:50:36.979 --> 00:50:38.339]  No, just lock them up.
[00:50:38.359 --> 00:50:42.681]  You two-bit heroes, making life miserable for innocent children.
[00:50:43.221 --> 00:50:44.722]  Why don't you go out and hunt real criminals?
[00:50:45.062 --> 00:50:46.562]  We got a tip on this drag race.
[00:50:46.722 --> 00:50:48.343]  Like when we found the marijuana.
[00:50:48.983 --> 00:50:50.424]  Well, sir, that's a very serious charge.
[00:50:50.484 --> 00:51:16.120]  Think about the tens of billions of dollars that Big Pharma makes a year, with close to 20% of the population being on antidepressants, when every major study shows that marijuana absolutely destroys depression in people, and Prozac can't even prove that it has any measurable positive effect, and they have to put on the insert that it may make you commit suicide.
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:21.767]  Things like alcohol kill people daily, and it's legal because it can be taxed.
[00:51:22.027 --> 00:51:24.030]  Happy to deliver alcohol.
[00:51:24.931 --> 00:51:26.173]  But weed is illegal, right?
[00:51:26.293 --> 00:51:28.315]  Hey bud, let's party!
[00:51:36.033 --> 00:51:38.816]  I do think, however, that the pharmaceutical companies should stay away.
[00:51:39.176 --> 00:51:40.357]  Like, just keep it natural.
[00:51:40.377 --> 00:51:41.378]  Let's have the sun out.
[00:51:41.398 --> 00:51:43.019]  You know, like, grow some seeds in the dirt.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:44.641]  You know, like, just stay away.
[00:51:44.721 --> 00:51:45.602]  You know, let it be.
[00:51:45.622 --> 00:51:47.043]  You know, like, let it grow organically.
[00:51:47.103 --> 00:51:48.925]  And, like, that's what will help people.
[00:51:48.985 --> 00:51:53.369]  It definitely should not be legal because that's helping us make money on the streets.
[00:51:53.609 --> 00:51:54.430]  End probation.
[00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:55.070]  That's right!
[00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:55.290]  Peace!
[00:51:55.631 --> 00:51:56.512]  What's the obstacle?
[00:51:56.832 --> 00:51:57.933]  What the hell is stopping it?
[00:51:57.973 --> 00:51:59.694]  Why is Texas taking so long?
[00:51:59.815 --> 00:52:00.875]  Because we're in Texas, dude.
[00:52:00.956 --> 00:52:01.196]  Yeah.
[00:52:01.736 --> 00:52:04.599]  There's so many benefits for something that's natural.
[00:52:04.619 --> 00:52:09.162]  We need to look more into natural medicines and not things that are scientifically made in a lab.
[00:52:20.011 --> 00:52:21.292]  This is not reefer madness.
[00:52:21.312 --> 00:52:33.738]  This is one big industry that has political clout trying to shut down another industry that basically has a product that grows freely and is not owned by anybody.
[00:52:33.858 --> 00:52:36.420]  I don't want the government regulating my marijuana.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.160]  Right now they're regulating you.
[00:52:38.581 --> 00:52:39.941]  They'll arrest you if you smoke it.
[00:52:40.061 --> 00:52:40.802]  That's regulation.
[00:52:41.182 --> 00:52:42.743]  But only if I get caught.
[00:52:42.943 --> 00:52:44.944]  Look at what the pharmaceutical companies are doing.
[00:52:45.164 --> 00:52:47.946]  They want to take away our informed consent
[00:52:49.184 --> 00:52:56.030]  And violate the Nuremberg Code, saying that they can inject us with whatever they deem to be necessary at any given time.
[00:52:56.070 --> 00:52:58.572]  We should be very, very concerned about this.
[00:52:58.592 --> 00:53:06.959]  I didn't know you were a weedhead, Tony.
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:09.121]  All my friends are.
[00:53:22.295 --> 00:53:30.622]  The biggest cheerleaders, unfortunately, for drug prohibition are the Christians, and they need to hear David Simpson's perspective on this.
[00:53:30.662 --> 00:53:33.124]  Joining us now is David Simpson, Texas Representative.
[00:53:33.144 --> 00:53:34.445]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Simpson.
[00:53:35.526 --> 00:53:37.247]  Well, it's a delight to be with you.
[00:53:37.708 --> 00:53:38.648]  Thank you for having me.
[00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:40.830]  Well, thank you, and thank you for putting this.
[00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:41.831]  Thank you for your work.
[00:53:41.871 --> 00:53:46.255]  I tell you what, if people want to know who the heir to Ron Paul is, it's this guy.
[00:53:46.295 --> 00:53:47.596]  This guy is my hero, I tell you.
[00:53:48.116 --> 00:53:50.638]  Talk to us about what you would do with
[00:53:51.604 --> 00:53:52.524]  with medical marijuana.
[00:53:52.544 --> 00:53:53.224]  What's your approach?
[00:53:53.264 --> 00:54:00.486]  What would you say to Christians who want to use the hammer of government, who see everything as a nail that needs to be hit down with force?
[00:54:02.106 --> 00:54:11.429]  Well, first of all, I like to focus on the proper role of government, and you can just go right to Romans 13.
[00:54:11.629 --> 00:54:21.011]  It talks about how God gave the civil magistrate the sword, and the sword is an image of force that can prod, it can punish.
[00:54:22.669 --> 00:54:29.053]  It's duty is to punish the wrongdoer, but it's interesting, it's not every wrongdoing.
[00:54:30.574 --> 00:54:49.285]  The commandments that the Apostle Paul focuses on in the middle of the chapter after talking about the magistrate's role are the second table of the law, not murdering, not stealing, not bearing false witness, or even planning to do so.
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:55:00.167]  The role of the civil magistrate is to punish the wrongdoer who harms his neighbor, taking away his life, liberty, or property.
[00:55:01.128 --> 00:55:04.291]  And it doesn't touch the first table of the law.
[00:55:04.331 --> 00:55:05.271]  That's the first thing.
[00:55:05.371 --> 00:55:12.137]  We don't want the civil government telling us how and when to worship and who to worship.
[00:55:12.737 --> 00:55:20.804]  That's something that we must follow as individuals, according to our conscience, and led captive, hopefully, by the Word of God.
[00:55:22.059 --> 00:55:30.766]  The other thing I'd focus on with respect to marijuana is that you start with a world that God created good, including all its plants.
[00:55:31.646 --> 00:55:37.111]  And some people misinterpreted my statement about that, but you have to start there.
[00:55:39.072 --> 00:55:51.862]  Certainly, good things that God made can be abused, but in 1 Timothy 4.4, it says that everything is to be received if it can be done so with thanksgiving, and that would assume faith.
[00:55:52.876 --> 00:56:10.810]  And so, what led me to repeal all the prohibitions for punishing people for possessing or cultivating or selling marijuana is it didn't, we shouldn't ban a plant, God may, we should focus on irresponsible actions that harm our neighbor.
[00:56:11.431 --> 00:56:17.396]  If you haven't harmed your neighbor, then the punishment, the government shouldn't be involved.
[00:56:17.476 --> 00:56:20.298]  Now, do our neighbors need help if they abuse something?
[00:56:21.358 --> 00:56:23.441]  Perhaps, but I don't think it's a sword.
[00:56:23.601 --> 00:56:26.725]  I think it's a loving, faithful approach.
[00:56:31.269 --> 00:56:33.790]  I just talked to a former prosecutor last week.
[00:56:33.830 --> 00:56:37.331]  We talked to Jim Geerak with Law Enforcement Against Prohibition.
[00:56:37.351 --> 00:56:45.033]  That's an organization of former prosecutors, former police officers, some of them still active but most of them are retired.
[00:56:45.534 --> 00:56:46.914]  They don't want to see prohibition.
[00:56:46.954 --> 00:56:49.275]  They understand how it's counterproductive.
[00:56:49.295 --> 00:56:52.836]  They understand how it destroys our liberties, it corrupts government.
[00:56:53.476 --> 00:56:58.778]  They've seen that happen and Jim Geerak is at the United Nations this week.
[00:56:59.378 --> 00:57:01.479]  Trying to get them to change their focus.
[00:57:01.519 --> 00:57:02.880]  Attacking this at the top level.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:07.782]  Trying to get them to change their focus from law enforcement to recognizing that it's a medical issue.
[00:57:08.142 --> 00:57:10.843]  And as Christians we ought to recognize that it's a spiritual issue.
[00:57:11.244 --> 00:57:20.408]  We're going to come back and I want to talk to, right after the break, I want to talk to David Simpson about how differently he would unregulate marijuana.
[00:57:20.848 --> 00:57:29.710]  As opposed to the way they've done it out west in the states where they've passed initiatives, heavily regulating it, heavily taxing it, creating a web of entrapment for people.
[00:57:30.050 --> 00:57:31.670]  David Simpson's bill would not do that.
[00:57:31.770 --> 00:57:32.751]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:57:32.971 --> 00:57:34.471]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:34.571 --> 00:57:44.653]  I'm David Knight, your host, and we're talking to David Simpson, a Texas representative who has just introduced some legislation that would remove marijuana from the Texas legal code completely.
[00:57:44.673 --> 00:57:47.034]  We're going to talk to him about the implications of that.
[00:57:47.754 --> 00:58:10.708]  I wanted to have him on especially because he addresses Christian issues, and as David Simpson was pointing out in the last segment, and as he wrote in an op-ed piece for the Dallas Morning News, he said the Bible warns about excessive drinking, eating, and sleeping, but it doesn't ban eating, drinking, and sleeping, or the substances or conditions associated with eating, drinking, and sleeping.
[00:58:11.488 --> 00:58:14.272]  So you can do that excessively, but it doesn't ban those things.
[00:58:14.312 --> 00:58:15.753]  He said there is a place for prohibition.
[00:58:16.214 --> 00:58:19.017]  There is a place for prohibition that's prohibiting aggression.
[00:58:19.698 --> 00:58:21.420]  And he was just talking about Romans 13.
[00:58:22.121 --> 00:58:29.530]  Certainly as conservative Republicans, conservative Christian Republicans, the main supporters of the war on drugs need to understand
[00:58:30.151 --> 00:58:34.953]  They ought to instantly be revulsed by this because of just what happens with private property.
[00:58:34.993 --> 00:58:45.237]  Look at civil asset forfeiture, where you're not charged with a crime, you're not convicted of a crime, they charge your property with the crime, and they confiscate your property.
[00:58:45.697 --> 00:58:49.919]  See, that's the kind of destruction of due process that happens under prohibition.
[00:58:49.939 --> 00:58:52.340]  Well, that's it for our show tonight.
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:56.842]  I'm Jakari Jackson from the InfoWars Command Center, and we'll see you again tomorrow night.
[00:59:03.843 --> 00:59:05.004]  Knockout is back.
[00:59:05.344 --> 00:59:16.448]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep, restful sleep, Knockout's it.
