[00:00:20.242 --> 00:00:22.388]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:23.831]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:24.312 --> 00:00:28.302]  It is April 13th, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:39.121]  Tonight, already the federal government has taken in a record one and a half trillion dollars in just the first half of this year.
[00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:47.764]  But happy days are here again as the government parties like it's 1929 as the big April 15th payday approaches.
[00:00:48.644 --> 00:00:53.906]  Meanwhile, Colorado voters cut out of the process by the rule of the GOP elite are
[00:00:56.978 --> 00:01:00.560]  And the Friday protest looms in Colorado.
[00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:10.546]  Then, the National Review laughed at Trump and called him an Alex Jones Show caller when Trump called for the release of the secret 28 pages of the 9-11 report.
[00:01:10.826 --> 00:01:17.470]  But now people across the political spectrum are calling for their release, and Obama says he'll consider it.
[00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.952]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:16.755]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:18.575]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:19.976]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.376]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:26.697]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:30.558]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.759]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.139]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.300]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:03.123 --> 00:03:10.889]  Tax time is once again upon us, and if you're a single male with no dependents like I am, you're being stuck for every dollar that the federal government can get out of you.
[00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:19.296]  But it's very interesting when you consider this $1.48 trillion government collects record high taxes in the first half of the fiscal year of 2016.
[00:03:20.737 --> 00:03:38.928]  Inflation-adjusted federal tax revenues hit a record $1.48 trillion for the first half of fiscal year 2016, but the federal government still ran a $461 billion deficit during that time, according to the latest monthly Treasury Department statement.
[00:03:39.248 --> 00:03:42.390]  So, which is to say, even though they're raking in records amount
[00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:43.330]  I don't
[00:03:59.645 --> 00:04:07.211]  Fun Planned Parenthood, we got commies running around and crawling over trash cans, and then even things that we really legitimately need, like a defense budget.
[00:04:07.532 --> 00:04:20.262]  You're blowing all this money making MRAPs, and then you leave them over there in foreign countries for ISIS to use against us, and then you use my tax dollars to give guns to cartels in Mexico, and all this other stuff you're doing that's wasting taxpayer monies.
[00:04:20.542 --> 00:04:24.125]  You shut down complete cities when, you know, celebrities or whoever come through.
[00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:26.247]  You know, you're shaking down
[00:04:26.807 --> 00:04:35.233]  You're telling people they can't get anywhere near the president when he comes into town and all these other measures that you're doing with our tax dollars.
[00:04:35.354 --> 00:04:41.838]  Meanwhile, you're giving us the business end, the shaft end, just completely wrecking our lives with regulations.
[00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.681]  And you'll see some of these things that make you pay for here in a little bit.
[00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:47.342]  It's just completely ridiculous.
[00:04:48.283 --> 00:04:55.633]  And it's a tax station without representation, but I don't know if you can do that because they are representing us, but they're doing it in the worst way possible.
[00:04:55.673 --> 00:04:56.934]  Think about in your hometown.
[00:04:56.954 --> 00:04:58.196]  What are they wasting money on?
[00:04:58.276 --> 00:05:00.319]  Actually, this is a report I need to get around to doing one day.
[00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:05.365]  Go out there to a man on the street and ask people what is the biggest thing that they're wasting tax money on or
[00:05:06.286 --> 00:05:07.988]  Biggest waste, in your personal opinion.
[00:05:08.008 --> 00:05:10.191]  I already gave out a few things that I don't like.
[00:05:10.532 --> 00:05:14.196]  You know, I think about how they want to use my money to fund Planned Parenthood.
[00:05:14.597 --> 00:05:20.304]  And this is the thing, like, to all you college kids or whoever, say, taxation is the answer to every problem.
[00:05:21.741 --> 00:05:25.043]  They may use your tax dollars in a way that you're not fond of.
[00:05:25.083 --> 00:05:30.347]  For example, you know, yes, I'm not a fan of the wall, but let's say they did use your tax money to build a wall.
[00:05:30.807 --> 00:05:33.689]  Your increase in tax payments would pay for that.
[00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:37.411]  Or, you know, let's increase taxes to pay for a free college.
[00:05:37.772 --> 00:05:45.377]  Now, once again, the notion of free college does sound good, but the issue is there's no such thing as free college.
[00:05:45.797 --> 00:05:46.637]  Somebody pays for it.
[00:05:46.657 --> 00:05:50.380]  Like, once again, I thought at 18, 19 years old, I'd probably say, yeah, that's a great idea too.
[00:05:50.941 --> 00:05:51.241]  We're good.
[00:06:05.678 --> 00:06:10.723]  Meanwhile, many of the same people who say all that stuff, they'll walk right by a homeless person and not give him a dollar.
[00:06:10.983 --> 00:06:15.967]  That guy's poor, he's lazy, he cheated on his wife, he got thrown out on the street, and maybe he is all those things.
[00:06:16.007 --> 00:06:22.393]  Maybe he's a disabled veteran who just doesn't know how to get all the pieces together to go and get a proper
[00:06:22.913 --> 00:06:24.874]  So, let's just one piece of my tax rant, and now I go on to part two.
[00:06:24.894 --> 00:06:25.054]  Many U.S.
[00:06:25.074 --> 00:06:26.735]  corporations pay little in federal income taxes, says a report.
[00:06:26.755 --> 00:06:28.176]  Among large profitable entities,
[00:06:50.109 --> 00:07:02.555]  Nineteen point five percent paid nothing in federal income taxes in 2012, said the report, which came at the behest of Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders, whose campaign circulated the study.
[00:07:02.575 --> 00:07:11.498]  And they say because of the tax loopholes and regulations, many guys were able to pull the rabbit out the hat, so to speak, and end up paying nothing.
[00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:14.400]  Meanwhile, they try to squeeze every dollar
[00:07:15.325 --> 00:07:16.125]  That they can out of me.
[00:07:16.165 --> 00:07:18.366]  It's like, you know, see those old Looney Tunes cartoons.
[00:07:18.386 --> 00:07:19.406]  They hold the guy upside down.
[00:07:19.446 --> 00:07:20.067]  They shake him out.
[00:07:20.427 --> 00:07:22.007]  And man, they do that to me every year.
[00:07:22.027 --> 00:07:23.768]  I mean, every which way.
[00:07:23.808 --> 00:07:25.548]  And now they got the Obamacare attacks.
[00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:28.069]  And it's the misnomer, right?
[00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.691]  It's not mandatory, but we're going to charge you for it if you don't get it.
[00:07:34.031 --> 00:07:36.272]  It's just like, you know, the old protection racket.
[00:07:36.292 --> 00:07:37.372]  Well, I guess it's not old.
[00:07:37.392 --> 00:07:38.073]  They still do it.
[00:07:38.933 --> 00:07:42.114]  You know, you're going to pay us this money or we're going to burn your business down.
[00:07:42.394 --> 00:07:43.695]  You're going to buy Obamacare.
[00:07:43.735 --> 00:07:45.416]  We're just going to take it out of your check anyway.
[00:07:45.436 --> 00:07:48.517]  You know, but, but people say, well, it's just, you don't have to have it.
[00:07:48.557 --> 00:07:49.697]  It's, it's voluntary.
[00:07:49.717 --> 00:07:52.819]  I'm like, yeah, it's voluntary that you come and take my money without my permission.
[00:07:53.119 --> 00:08:00.922]  But this is the mentality that we have in 2016 people just saying, use my money for whatever reason that you want.
[00:08:02.003 --> 00:08:02.543]  There's really,
[00:08:03.243 --> 00:08:11.205]  Very little accountability, and even when they do catch these guys stealing stuff, you know, it's like, oh, oops, mistakes were made, let's move on to other things.
[00:08:11.245 --> 00:08:23.847]  Like I was watching Better Call Saul or whatever, and the guy, he's all nice and sweet, and they look like some family out of a Looney Tunes or a Disney movie, and then they're stealing all this money, got bags of money and cash in the house.
[00:08:23.867 --> 00:08:28.688]  That's pretty much what many of the politicians are doing now in our current times.
[00:08:28.748 --> 00:08:30.849]  Now let's talk about the political spectrum.
[00:08:31.409 --> 00:08:42.913]  Because we see one Donald J. Trump and regardless of what you feel about the guy, I do think that both he and Bernie Sanders, and I'm looking at the broad spectrum, are being shafted by the system.
[00:08:42.953 --> 00:08:50.515]  We see that here in the city of Austin, Texas, a couple weeks ago people were calling in to KLBJ, the local radio station, saying,
[00:08:51.175 --> 00:08:51.415]  I don't
[00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.812]  Trump can win with 1,100 delegates.
[00:09:14.252 --> 00:09:25.140]  And this is Randy Evans, and he's predicting Wednesday that Trump would likely be able to secure the Republican nomination if he captures anything more than 1,100 delegates, short of the 1,237 delegates needed for a simple majority.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.721]  Now, once again, there's a lot of hanky-panky and
[00:09:35.805 --> 00:09:39.888]  Questionable, at best, ethics that are going on in this election cycle.
[00:09:40.369 --> 00:09:41.910]  So, you know, you take it for what you will.
[00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.212]  Some people saying that he's a big crybaby because he lost Colorado.
[00:09:45.653 --> 00:09:53.719]  And on that note, talking about Colorado and the whole situation going on with Ted Cruz, we see this piece from the New York Times, and they say, after loss in Colorado,
[00:09:54.139 --> 00:09:57.021]  Donald Trump supporters give state chairman an earful.
[00:09:57.061 --> 00:10:03.266]  So basically they are calling the chairman and saying that we have a big issue with the way this election was run.
[00:10:03.606 --> 00:10:16.016]  But according to the New York Times, this is, you know, somewhat indicative of some changes that were made last year after after the Republican National Committee decided that the outcome of the state straw polls
[00:10:16.516 --> 00:10:16.816]  We're good
[00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:37.677]  In
[00:10:58.019 --> 00:11:00.160]  Opponent, I guess, in the Democratic Party.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.281]  And they say Hillary Clinton, the first probationer in the White House, potentially.
[00:11:04.301 --> 00:11:07.622]  This is an article out of Kurt Nimmo's Arsenal.
[00:11:08.162 --> 00:11:20.225]  It says, criminologists and government officials say if Clinton is indicted for ignoring a record retention law and mishandling classified information and she accepts a plea, she may be put on probation.
[00:11:20.705 --> 00:11:24.246]  The deal would need to be struck after entering the White House, however.
[00:11:25.464 --> 00:11:27.284]  And if you guys recall, it wasn't that long ago.
[00:11:27.304 --> 00:11:28.685]  It was during one of the debates.
[00:11:29.145 --> 00:11:32.706]  She said, when somebody asked her, you know, Mrs. Clinton, what do you think about all these emails?
[00:11:32.746 --> 00:11:33.706]  You think you're going to be indicted?
[00:11:33.746 --> 00:11:36.667]  She said, for goodness sake, that's not even going to happen.
[00:11:36.807 --> 00:11:39.047]  I'm not even going to answer that question.
[00:11:39.468 --> 00:11:42.668]  And I guess that's the best thing you can do is deny, deny, deny.
[00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:44.569]  And as I always say about Mrs. Clinton,
[00:11:45.209 --> 00:11:53.996]  In the grand scheme of things, I don't think the emails are the biggest issue, especially when you consider the Benghazi hearings and all the things that went along with that.
[00:11:54.316 --> 00:12:05.946]  And they tried to say that it was basically the Prophet, the innocence of Muslims or whatever it was about the Prophet Muhammad and how that spurred all these people to go rush the U.S.
[00:12:06.066 --> 00:12:08.508]  Embassy and kill Ambassador Stevens.
[00:12:08.808 --> 00:12:11.350]  And then they had the movie 13 Hours and they're like, there wasn't any
[00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:12.311]  We're good to go.
[00:12:38.189 --> 00:12:48.156]  Yeah, I think Benghazi is a much bigger deal, especially when you consider how Ambassador Stevens, they even referenced this in the movie, you know, he's typing out his emails, he's saying, hey, it's not safe here, I need more security.
[00:12:48.196 --> 00:12:53.920]  And how they respond, they actually took security away from the guy going up towards September 11th.
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.504]  So this is how the State Department acts when they got foreign people out there saying that, hey, I need help.
[00:12:59.544 --> 00:13:00.465]  He's like, no, we'll just take
[00:13:01.445 --> 00:13:02.825]  Security and staff away from you.
[00:13:02.926 --> 00:13:05.666]  They even referenced in the movie the guys are looking around a compound.
[00:13:05.706 --> 00:13:11.148]  He's like, hey man, at an official embassy, they got roadblocks and machine gun nests and snipers on the roof.
[00:13:11.168 --> 00:13:12.468]  And it's like, well, we got budget cuts.
[00:13:13.648 --> 00:13:18.329]  So Mrs. Clinton can ride around in bulletproof cars and say she's ducking sniper fire.
[00:13:18.369 --> 00:13:18.850]  But a U.S.
[00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:24.431]  ambassador staying at a compound that's supposed to be an official embassy, he had pretty much nothing.
[00:13:24.511 --> 00:13:28.272]  And I mean, I'm not sure how accurate the film was, but in the film they depicted
[00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:31.975]  The Benghazi Embassy is basically a resort house.
[00:13:32.035 --> 00:13:34.637]  It had a wall and a pool, but that's pretty much it.
[00:13:34.657 --> 00:13:40.222]  They had a gate on the door, but that's really not going to stop any type of terrorist who wants to come in there and inflict some harm.
[00:13:40.622 --> 00:13:42.924]  And as we're talking about terrorists, let's talk about 9-11.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:51.108]  Now for a very long time, InfoWars.com has been talking about the missing 28 pages.
[00:13:51.468 --> 00:13:52.470]  You guys may have heard of this.
[00:13:52.850 --> 00:14:03.264]  It recently made its way to a piece on 60 Minutes, and not knocking the 60 Minutes piece I thought was a very well produced piece, but there is very little in that piece that we haven't been talking about for the past
[00:14:03.684 --> 00:14:04.024]  I think so.
[00:14:25.004 --> 00:14:25.724]  I don't know.
[00:14:40.211 --> 00:14:44.933]  You know, we told you that a long time ago, but that's just, I guess, how it goes, the demonization of the media.
[00:14:45.373 --> 00:14:59.259]  And they say President Obama, back to the 9-11 documents, excuse me, President Obama will decide whether to declassify the 28 pages of sealed documents, which some speculate show a Saudi connection to the 9-11 attacks.
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:06.783]  And this is brought about by former Florida Democratic Senator Bob Graham, and he told this to Fox News late Tuesday.
[00:15:07.717 --> 00:15:08.057]  I think so.
[00:15:31.781 --> 00:15:34.022]  Many people think there is a Saudi connection.
[00:15:34.082 --> 00:15:47.830]  Basically, the Saudi government, even if it was rogue elements within the government, the guys in the piece were saying that the Saudi government was somehow involved in providing means and shelter to at least two of the hijackers on 9-11.
[00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:55.934]  Once again, we already know that many of the hijackers were trained here in the United States, you know, and all the weird shenanigans that all that details.
[00:15:56.414 --> 00:16:06.946]  Once again you know you can bring somebody the news they can bring you the exact same news that we do many years later but you know it's legitimate when they do it we do it like nobody really cares about anything.
[00:16:07.507 --> 00:16:10.871]  Now let's talk about you know you're driving in your car right so you're driving in your car
[00:16:11.892 --> 00:16:12.393]  We're good to go.
[00:16:28.976 --> 00:16:35.983]  Which basically means if they pull you over, they can plug in your phone and see what your activities were immediately before you were pulled over.
[00:16:36.904 --> 00:16:45.892]  And they're saying police have the Textalyzer, a gadget that can help them gauge if a distracted driver has been using their mobile phone before the road incident.
[00:16:46.633 --> 00:16:49.615]  And it's built by Celebrite, an Israeli company.
[00:16:50.515 --> 00:16:55.176]  And they say that they also helped them crack the FBI phone, and that's a whole other can of worms.
[00:16:55.216 --> 00:16:57.197]  I don't know if I got time to get into it right now.
[00:16:57.217 --> 00:16:58.998]  We're talking about the iPhone deal.
[00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:08.901]  Basically, John McAfee of John McAfee's Antivirus Software, you probably have it on your computer right now, told the FBI in simple step-by-step instructions how to do this on live TV.
[00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:11.281]  Meanwhile, they wanted Apple to build in the back door.
[00:17:11.301 --> 00:17:12.422]  I don't think it was about
[00:17:13.622 --> 00:17:16.765]  National Security, I think it's about trying to get Apple to bend over to the system.
[00:17:16.785 --> 00:17:19.627]  So I do give Apple their props on that one.
[00:17:19.827 --> 00:17:22.490]  As we all know, Apple was implicated in the PRISM system.
[00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.072]  So take that for what you will.
[00:17:25.992 --> 00:17:29.876]  But when you think about this, this textilizer, I mean, they can
[00:17:30.476 --> 00:17:39.609]  Not just look at your recent texts, but they can take anything off your phone and include your private text messages, pictures, any other sensitive documents that may be on your phone.
[00:17:39.629 --> 00:17:45.698]  So that's why I'm very much against this, as I am many of the things that they do when they try to pull you over, whether it's a forced
[00:17:46.098 --> 00:17:52.845]  Blood draws with the no refusal weekend and some places they do it year-round but you know that's just another sign of the times that we have to work with.
[00:17:53.225 --> 00:18:05.477]  And finally before we go into more special reports at the end of our broadcast we have this whistleblower says Panama Papers a CIA op and these are the words of USB banker Bradley Birkenfeld he says
[00:18:06.098 --> 00:18:16.343]  The CIA, I'm sure, is behind this, in my opinion, and he points out how the people named in the document are, quote, enemies of the United States, Russia, China, Pakistan, and so on and so forth.
[00:18:16.423 --> 00:18:21.165]  So he thinks there's definitely some CIA connection involved in here, and hey, who knows?
[00:18:21.225 --> 00:18:22.005]  It very well could be.
[00:18:22.025 --> 00:18:22.826]  We know the CIA has been
[00:18:23.486 --> 00:18:29.029]  Bringing cocaine into the country as well as many other shady activities, so I really wouldn't put it past him.
[00:18:29.409 --> 00:18:30.510]  So stay tuned after this break.
[00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:32.251]  We'll have many more special reports.
[00:18:32.471 --> 00:18:43.077]  We'll have a filmmaker in studio who's going to talk to David Knight as well as another man who was on the show earlier talking to Alex, talking about how he used to be affiliated with these terrorist groups, but now he's actually a Christian minister.
[00:18:43.457 --> 00:18:44.257]  You don't want to miss that.
[00:18:44.297 --> 00:18:46.859]  Stay tuned for the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:19:04.502 --> 00:19:13.270]  My fellow Infowarriors, my fellow Americans, there's never been an attack on our voting rights and our free speech in this country's history like we're seeing right now.
[00:19:13.851 --> 00:19:17.154]  Last weekend they cancelled the election in Colorado.
[00:19:18.052 --> 00:19:18.232]  I don't
[00:19:37.773 --> 00:19:43.914]  We're going to show you some of that footage where the left has announced with communist banners, no free speech, no Trump allowed.
[00:19:44.294 --> 00:19:46.935]  So this is pure tyranny, an attack on free speech on every front.
[00:19:46.975 --> 00:19:48.275]  Rob Dew, tell us about the events.
[00:19:48.495 --> 00:19:58.137]  Alright, so Friday, April 15th from 3 to 6, we're going to be at the Colorado GOP headquarters at 5950 South Willow Drive, and that's in Greenwood Village, Colorado.
[00:19:58.157 --> 00:20:01.218]  We're going to go there and support the rest of the GOP.
[00:20:01.718 --> 00:20:02.639]  Who's mad as hell.
[00:20:02.759 --> 00:20:10.045]  One million GOP-ers are pissed off that they didn't get to cast their vote for the President of the United States, for the Republican Party.
[00:20:10.265 --> 00:20:13.227]  And imagine if a million black people had been disenfranchised.
[00:20:13.267 --> 00:20:14.328]  People are upset about that.
[00:20:14.468 --> 00:20:15.089]  Jim Crow laws.
[00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:15.529]  I am too.
[00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:19.092]  But what about what's happening now to everybody and this precedent?
[00:20:19.132 --> 00:20:19.773]  And let's be clear.
[00:20:20.293 --> 00:20:22.193]  This is about free speech, not even about Trump.
[00:20:22.574 --> 00:20:23.714]  This is very, very important.
[00:20:24.134 --> 00:20:28.875]  Everybody needs to be there and everybody needs to get their friends and family together.
[00:20:29.515 --> 00:20:32.316]  Portland State students for Donald Trump, that'll start at 2 o'clock.
[00:20:33.236 --> 00:20:35.897]  Location will be the Smith Memorial Student Union.
[00:20:36.237 --> 00:20:40.218]  That's at 1825 Southwest Broadway in Portland, Oregon.
[00:20:40.578 --> 00:20:45.659]  So we're going to be out there as well, standing with these students who want to have this meeting in support of Donald Trump.
[00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:46.419]  That is their right.
[00:20:46.439 --> 00:20:47.620]  That is their freedom of speech.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.400]  And these bullies!
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.361]  These bullies have been trying to stop it.
[00:20:50.381 --> 00:20:55.284]  So on Infowars.com, we're going to have an article up by tonight, breaking down the maps, where it is.
[00:20:55.364 --> 00:20:58.145]  Come out and support these reporters, also in free speech.
[00:20:58.286 --> 00:21:02.948]  But they're going to be wearing Trump hats and Infowars shirts just to show the type of garbage that's going on.
[00:21:03.188 --> 00:21:04.169]  You've seen the clips, Biggs.
[00:21:04.189 --> 00:21:06.550]  We're going to play just a few clips of it now of Portland.
[00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:07.571]  These people are scary.
[00:21:07.891 --> 00:21:08.491]  I'm on staff!
[00:21:08.531 --> 00:21:09.192]  You f***er!
[00:21:09.272 --> 00:21:09.992]  Shut the f*** up!
[00:21:10.052 --> 00:21:12.573]  If you don't let her talk, I will f*** it up!
[00:21:36.022 --> 00:21:40.685]  What's incredible about Portland is that it's faculty there screaming at people saying, you have no free speech.
[00:21:40.705 --> 00:21:42.286]  The staff, yeah, the staff are yelling at people.
[00:21:42.386 --> 00:21:44.707]  They're like, shut up, sit down, we're going to tell you what's going on.
[00:21:45.008 --> 00:21:47.969]  And they said, if you have another event, we're going to come back.
[00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.930]  So here it is.
[00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:50.951]  There's going to be another event on Saturday.
[00:21:51.031 --> 00:21:51.932]  So are you going to be there?
[00:21:52.012 --> 00:21:52.392]  We'll see.
[00:21:52.592 --> 00:21:55.234]  We'll see if free speech gets under attack at Portland State University.
[00:21:55.554 --> 00:22:00.117]  Those six brave people went and stood against the First Amendment fascism.
[00:22:00.977 --> 00:22:03.019]  of the corporately George Soros funded left.
[00:22:03.099 --> 00:22:10.827]  Let's have hundreds of people show up where they're slated speakers by the student group to stand up for free speech and stand up against this malice level tyranny.
[00:22:11.148 --> 00:22:14.631]  Joe Biggs, one more time, tell folks the date of the Portland situation.
[00:22:14.691 --> 00:22:16.453]  Do it one more time for what's happening Friday.
[00:22:16.553 --> 00:22:20.095]  So once again, Saturday the 16th at Portland State Students for Donald Trump.
[00:22:20.395 --> 00:22:21.395]  That'll be at 2 o'clock.
[00:22:21.495 --> 00:22:22.236]  That is the start time.
[00:22:22.256 --> 00:22:24.097]  I'll arrive a little bit early and get ready to go in there.
[00:22:24.357 --> 00:22:29.839]  The location is at the Smith Memorial Student Union and that's at 1825 Southwest Broadway.
[00:22:30.179 --> 00:22:34.822]  The 15th, the GOP protest in Colorado will be at Greenwood Village, Colorado from 3 to 6.
[00:22:34.962 --> 00:22:39.204]  I'll put all the address information and maps on in the article and in the description of the video.
[00:22:39.824 --> 00:22:40.945]  All right, fantastic folks.
[00:22:40.985 --> 00:22:42.186]  Hey, stand up for the First Amendment.
[00:22:42.567 --> 00:22:43.668]  Stand up for your voting rights.
[00:22:44.128 --> 00:22:46.590]  There should be an election in Colorado and other states.
[00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:48.272]  There should be a thing called voters.
[00:22:48.632 --> 00:22:51.755]  Soon they're going to say voters never existed and it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:22:51.995 --> 00:22:52.656]  I'm not joking.
[00:22:53.356 --> 00:22:57.220]  Now's the time to stand up for free speech and freedom of the press and voting or lose it all.
[00:23:02.865 --> 00:23:05.888]  Joining us at the bottom of the hour is a man I want to get on for a full hour.
[00:23:07.023 --> 00:23:14.666]  In the near future, Kamal Saleem was born into a large Sunni Muslim family in the heart of the Middle East.
[00:23:15.246 --> 00:23:18.007]  And of course, that's the group Saudi Arabia is pushing in to take over all over.
[00:23:18.367 --> 00:23:24.949]  Kamal was then recruited by the Muslim Brotherhood at an early age and completed his first mission in Israel at the age of seven.
[00:23:25.589 --> 00:23:30.851]  Kamal was also recruited by the Palestinian Liberation Organization, PLO, and other radical Muslim groups.
[00:23:32.132 --> 00:23:38.654]  The many years of his radical Islamist training resulted in Kamal mastering every form of divisive extremist tactic.
[00:23:38.974 --> 00:23:44.196]  Kamal has since become a man on a new mission as an ambassador for Christ, the one true living God.
[00:23:44.616 --> 00:23:48.098]  He is well-versed in the Holy Bible, Quran, Hadith, Sharia law.
[00:23:48.338 --> 00:23:50.959]  He believes that radical Islam is the most broadly disguised
[00:23:51.499 --> 00:23:52.340]  We're good to go.
[00:24:04.235 --> 00:24:09.238]  An autobiography entitled, The Blood of Lambs, that's available at komeministries.com.
[00:24:09.278 --> 00:24:12.199]  K-O-M-E ministries dot com.
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:23.085]  He's also co-authored The Coalition, a novel that is the first in a series and a merger of fiction and reality, projecting the future global war on terror, released in November of 2014.
[00:24:23.145 --> 00:24:24.166]  So, Kamal Saleem, thank you for
[00:24:28.348 --> 00:24:29.328]  Coming on with us.
[00:24:29.368 --> 00:24:40.773]  I know it takes a lot of courage what you've done in the last few decades as somebody who's been on the inside coming on the outside because isn't that an automatic death sentence once you've, you know, been involved in what you were involved in to then leave it?
[00:24:41.624 --> 00:24:42.885]  Yes, you're absolutely right.
[00:24:43.025 --> 00:24:47.767]  Alex, it's good to be with you, and thank you for being a shining light for all of us.
[00:24:48.367 --> 00:24:49.987]  You've been there as a soldier, too.
[00:24:50.568 --> 00:24:52.288]  I'm thankful for you and what you do.
[00:24:52.749 --> 00:24:53.349]  Yes, it is.
[00:24:53.549 --> 00:25:00.932]  In Islam, it's called apostasy, and Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam, in his traditions, in the Hadith, said, if anyone converts, kill him.
[00:25:02.372 --> 00:25:02.592]  Wow.
[00:25:02.993 --> 00:25:04.374]  Tell us, I mean, I want to talk about the film.
[00:25:04.434 --> 00:25:05.474]  You're a big part of the film.
[00:25:06.035 --> 00:25:07.296]  Revelationofthemovie.info.
[00:25:07.936 --> 00:25:19.545]  And just give us a preview the next time you come on, because I know you're just a highly regarded, really smart guy, and I hope you become part of the show, giving us inside intel and understanding from what you've witnessed to decipher what's happening.
[00:25:19.565 --> 00:25:22.788]  But just give us a snapshot of your awakening, what we're facing.
[00:25:23.108 --> 00:25:28.132]  A lot of folks are calling this a radical Islamic sleeper cell, Tet Offensive in the making.
[00:25:29.335 --> 00:25:32.218]  Tell us your experience, why you woke up, and what you think is coming, sir.
[00:25:33.199 --> 00:25:44.289]  Well, what's going on, all in all, that the isms are coming together, like Islamism, Socialism, Secularism, Fascism, Liberalism, Secularism.
[00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:49.254]  All of them are part of the ism movement for the last days, and they are united together
[00:25:49.815 --> 00:26:05.961]  For one world order to, you know, to make the whole world in pluralism, one state, one heart, and therefore it will throw off the whole civilization into protection from different things, and now they have to go under world government.
[00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:10.393]  In my experience, I was born in Beirut, Lebanon to a Muslim Sunni family.
[00:26:10.893 --> 00:26:13.495]  My first person who radicalized me was my mom.
[00:26:13.975 --> 00:26:18.138]  Out of 14 brothers and sisters, we were radicalized, the boys.
[00:26:18.578 --> 00:26:24.322]  My mother told me, if you kill Jews and Christians, your hand will light up before the throne of Allah.
[00:26:24.855 --> 00:26:26.777]  And the host of heaven will celebrate what you did.
[00:26:27.297 --> 00:26:33.842]  From my childhood, my heart was to kill the deceivers, which is the Jews and the Christians.
[00:26:34.343 --> 00:26:42.249]  From there, I was recruited in a neighborhood mosque, which is in the mosque in the United States of America.
[00:26:42.329 --> 00:26:44.151]  It is not like the church.
[00:26:44.551 --> 00:26:47.894]  The mosque is an embassy to represent the Islamic State.
[00:26:48.454 --> 00:26:53.839]  It is a parliament to send the people of the mosque to engage the civilization they are in.
[00:26:54.497 --> 00:27:00.161]  So therefore I was recruited in a mosque by a special group called the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:27:00.561 --> 00:27:04.844]  The Muslim Brotherhood came in 1928 after the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1924.
[00:27:04.964 --> 00:27:17.493]  And our agenda was, at that time when I was with them, is to re-establish the Islamic Caliphate and Islamic Sharia and One World Order under Allah.
[00:27:17.953 --> 00:27:21.115]  By establishing Ummah, you know, which is Islamic State.
[00:27:21.316 --> 00:27:26.960]  And this is what you see on the ISIS flag, the Muslim Brotherhood flag, the Saudi flag.
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:32.964]  You see the swords, you know, like there's no peace without the sword, unless the whole and everybody surrendered them.
[00:27:33.524 --> 00:27:38.328]  I was trained in my young age, at seven years old, that's when I was recruited.
[00:27:38.988 --> 00:27:39.589]  And I was
[00:27:40.646 --> 00:27:40.906]  You know,
[00:27:56.608 --> 00:28:22.088]  sent to Israel at seven years old and eight years old and from there I was recruited by the Saudi Arabian government because I was raising fund from them for the cause and a call and when they found my heart is for Islam then they start utilizing me to the point they sent me to Europe to engage Europe in culture jihad and you see where Europe is and that was India in 1970 and whatsoever in those years and from there
[00:28:26.582 --> 00:28:28.264]  They sent me to the United States of America.
[00:28:28.284 --> 00:28:33.610]  I was commissioned because we could not bring the American people from the outside.
[00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:36.453]  We have to inside America to take them down.
[00:28:36.954 --> 00:28:42.240]  And so therefore, my award that they sent me to do, it was not like the 9-11 people.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.724]  It was specifically, you know, still
[00:28:46.935 --> 00:28:52.340]  The methodology where America's we can work around and do everything that need to be done.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:57.646]  So you were kind of preparing the ground and what information warfare to accept radical Islam coming in?
[00:28:59.147 --> 00:29:00.188]  Say it again, I'm sorry, forgive me.
[00:29:00.208 --> 00:29:01.890]  You were engaged in propaganda offensives?
[00:29:02.978 --> 00:29:03.818]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:29:03.858 --> 00:29:18.605]  You know, my job was to go to the jail system and create a clash of culture, recruit black African-Americans, and therefore, you know, and convert them to Islam and hope someday they will clash with the other race.
[00:29:18.805 --> 00:29:21.686]  And so we create a great divide and it has been accomplished.
[00:29:21.706 --> 00:29:29.210]  So you were trained by Saudi Arabia to create racial division in America aligned Islam versus white Christianity?
[00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:36.832]  By the Muslim Brotherhood, Saudi Arabian, and you know, this is the Islamic culture that we were trained with and for.
[00:29:37.413 --> 00:29:41.334]  And our current administration has fulfilled that culture.
[00:29:41.374 --> 00:29:47.436]  But the other part is to invade the universities and the colleges, to establish Muslim Student Association,
[00:29:48.096 --> 00:29:48.937]  We're good to go.
[00:30:01.744 --> 00:30:04.466]  Which is their constitution to take their head off with.
[00:30:04.806 --> 00:30:15.114]  And then the other part is to engage politicians and by politicians power, by the God of Mammon, you know, because we know that a lot of politician money is very important to them.
[00:30:15.234 --> 00:30:24.021]  And last but not least, engage the poor neighborhood where they are weak and they're hungry and nobody want to touch them there.
[00:30:24.121 --> 00:30:27.604]  We can thrive on their, feed them and change their culture from within.
[00:30:28.271 --> 00:30:33.135]  This is a conspiracy of different evil organizations who all are just allied against Christianity.
[00:30:34.196 --> 00:30:39.440]  I mean, Obama won't let, for like, the latest number was 700 and something refugees came in that were almost all Sunni.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.642]  And he let in three Christians.
[00:30:43.183 --> 00:30:44.564]  And it's mainly Christians being slaughtered.
[00:30:44.584 --> 00:30:47.706]  And the UN admits, slaughter of Christians doubled the last ten years.
[00:30:48.287 --> 00:30:50.629]  Peaceful Christians are being targeted everywhere, for no reason.
[00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.930]  Because there's a spirit.
[00:30:53.097 --> 00:30:53.417]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:30:53.437 --> 00:30:54.878]  The thing is, in 1985, I had a severe car wreck.
[00:31:19.808 --> 00:31:22.309]  And my left side was broken in many places.
[00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:27.212]  And in the process, I met a man and two other physicians.
[00:31:27.732 --> 00:31:28.673]  All were Christians.
[00:31:29.393 --> 00:31:36.777]  And at the end of the day, they took me home to recover because I was not... The hospital was ready to let me go, but they took me home to take care of me.
[00:31:37.578 --> 00:31:40.761]  There in their home, I discovered something totally different.
[00:31:40.781 --> 00:31:44.524]  That all the lie that I was told, that we worship the same God.
[00:31:45.145 --> 00:31:51.351]  I thought we really did, but I found out Jehovah God Almighty and Allah are not the same God.
[00:31:51.391 --> 00:31:52.692]  They're two different Gods.
[00:31:53.453 --> 00:31:57.719]  And when I examined them, I found one God so loved the world.
[00:31:57.779 --> 00:32:01.905]  The other God, there's no love and mercy in His creation.
[00:32:02.726 --> 00:32:03.668]  His name is not love.
[00:32:03.728 --> 00:32:06.852]  And He said that the whole world was worth anything to Him.
[00:32:06.972 --> 00:32:08.415]  He destroyed it time and time again.
[00:32:08.995 --> 00:32:09.995]  And the list goes on.
[00:32:10.316 --> 00:32:14.597]  But from there, I watched the biggest Bible that I've seen in my life.
[00:32:14.757 --> 00:32:21.639]  That was how these Christian people lived their life and how the husband treated his wife like a princess and not like a slave.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:28.742]  Versus how we treated our daughters and our wives and our, you know, the whole family as women.
[00:32:29.415 --> 00:32:32.316]  And from there, you know, I've discovered something new.
[00:32:32.396 --> 00:32:35.797]  It's called unconditional love that I never was familiar with.
[00:32:35.857 --> 00:32:38.817]  In Islam, there's nothing, there's no unconditional love.
[00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:40.018]  Everything is conditional.
[00:32:40.878 --> 00:32:42.678]  So therefore, today I'm my favorite wife.
[00:32:42.738 --> 00:32:46.679]  Tomorrow, if you dishonor me, I have the right to take your head off, to behead you.
[00:32:47.179 --> 00:32:51.440]  And vice versa, if you convert from Muslim to Christian, then I'm
[00:32:53.922 --> 00:33:04.757]  Your father have to kill you, you know, all this is part of the Islamic, you know understanding of fundamentalism a Lot of people ask me what is the most important
[00:33:06.286 --> 00:33:06.546]  I think?
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:04.437 --> 00:37:10.039]  Massive protests were held in Chicago last night after a 16-year-old boy was shot and killed by a cop.
[00:37:10.519 --> 00:37:16.980]  Now an eyewitness to the death of this teenager said that the boy was trying to jump a fence when he was shot dead.
[00:37:17.281 --> 00:37:20.601]  His pants legs got caught on the fence and then he hit the ground.
[00:37:21.042 --> 00:37:25.643]  This unidentified witness said if he hadn't have gotten shot he would have cleared the fence.
[00:37:26.283 --> 00:37:31.065]  And a law enforcement source did confirm that account, saying that his pants leg had gotten caught on the fence.
[00:37:31.105 --> 00:37:32.526]  You can see that video there.
[00:37:33.106 --> 00:37:35.487]  And this is 16-year-old Pierre Laurie.
[00:37:35.907 --> 00:37:39.849]  He died on Tuesday as a result of this gunshot wound to the chest.
[00:37:40.409 --> 00:37:47.712]  Now, the Chicago chief of detectives said the teen ran from a car that was believed to be connected to an earlier shooting.
[00:37:48.212 --> 00:37:51.795]  And it was an armed confrontation that resulted in the officer shooting Lori.
[00:37:51.876 --> 00:37:53.557]  A weapon was found at the scene.
[00:37:54.038 --> 00:38:03.686]  Now, unfortunately, because we have had crooked cops in the past faking their testimony, we can only take this at face value until further investigation.
[00:38:04.087 --> 00:38:07.470]  However, this is not just a normal 16-year-old.
[00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:10.292]  This kid, you can see from the pictures, he was a
[00:38:11.053 --> 00:38:11.773]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:38:33.058 --> 00:38:44.853]  So, this is what made me so upset about this story, is why are people only protesting when it is a cop that shoots a black man, and especially one that's affiliated with gangs?
[00:38:45.273 --> 00:38:50.140]  I'm sorry, but if you're choosing a life of crime, there are some consequences there.
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:55.303]  Let's talk about the amount of people that have been killed in Chicago alone thus far in 2016.
[00:38:55.363 --> 00:39:00.987]  So far, there have been 166 homicides, 913 people have been shot, and out of that, four were in police officer-involved shootings.
[00:39:09.093 --> 00:39:11.474]  Three people were killed by police so far.
[00:39:11.734 --> 00:39:12.354]  One wounded.
[00:39:12.674 --> 00:39:12.934]  Okay?
[00:39:13.355 --> 00:39:23.938]  So it's outrageous that there are no protests and candlelight vigils for the 166 other people who have been shot and killed this year in Chicago.
[00:39:24.358 --> 00:39:25.259]  But get this!
[00:39:25.839 --> 00:39:28.401]  So Sean King, you may remember him.
[00:39:28.501 --> 00:39:31.964]  He was part of the whole Black Lives Matter movement, kind of rose up out of that.
[00:39:32.004 --> 00:39:36.868]  Now he's the social justice writer at the New York Daily News.
[00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:42.452]  Well, now he is blaming the crime within the black community on the cops.
[00:39:42.812 --> 00:39:49.458]  He says that cops aren't doing enough policing now because they're so afraid of these body cameras and all this retaliation.
[00:39:50.038 --> 00:39:53.823]  That now the crime is rising in places like Chicago and Baltimore.
[00:39:54.243 --> 00:39:54.864]  Imagine that.
[00:39:55.265 --> 00:40:01.853]  The article is titled, People are dying in Chicago and Baltimore because of incompetent police and a broken system.
[00:40:02.294 --> 00:40:07.340]  So last year, there was too much policing going on in the black community, and that's why
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:12.943]  There was this disproportionate amount of crime being recorded within the black community because there was too much policing.
[00:40:13.283 --> 00:40:16.464]  And now they're not doing enough and the crime is increasing.
[00:40:16.524 --> 00:40:18.005]  So it just doesn't even make any sense.
[00:40:18.045 --> 00:40:20.066]  You can't really have it both ways.
[00:40:20.486 --> 00:40:31.832]  Perhaps the police are not policing these communities because they don't want to lose their life or possibly their career, potentially killing a beloved gang member.
[00:40:32.572 --> 00:40:40.856]  And of course a lot of these cops don't want to go into these communities because this anti-cop rhetoric has led to police officers being murdered on the job.
[00:40:40.896 --> 00:40:43.898]  There's a lot of, the morale is really low.
[00:40:44.538 --> 00:40:45.339]  But he's not wrong.
[00:40:45.719 --> 00:40:48.340]  Here's another article out of FiveThirtyEight.com.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:57.825]  Gun violence spiked and arrests declined in Chicago right after the release of a Laquan McDonald video that was a black 17-year-old male.
[00:40:57.865 --> 00:41:01.127]  He was shot 16 times and he was killed by a police officer
[00:41:01.767 --> 00:41:05.251]  In October of 2014, he was carrying a three-inch knife.
[00:41:05.452 --> 00:41:10.297]  Of course, it didn't seem to be an immediate threat to the police officer, but he was shot 16 times.
[00:41:10.878 --> 00:41:18.287]  The issue is that the video of the incident was not made public until a judge ruled that it had to be released more than a year later.
[00:41:18.347 --> 00:41:20.369]  So, of course, there were protests resulting from that.
[00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:23.791]  And in that case, those protests were absolutely justified.
[00:41:23.851 --> 00:41:27.671]  But a lot of the times, people are saying, oh, he was just an innocent kid.
[00:41:27.711 --> 00:41:29.412]  He had so much life ahead of him.
[00:41:29.912 --> 00:41:46.735]  Well, according to the Washington Post, who did an in-depth reporting on the amount of people that were being shot and killed by police officers, they found that among males between the ages of 14 and 17, the interracial homicide commission gap is nearly tenfold.
[00:41:47.495 --> 00:41:51.578]  So you're seeing these kids committing even more homicides.
[00:41:51.738 --> 00:41:55.121]  So you can't just go and say, well, he's 16 years old.
[00:41:55.201 --> 00:41:57.022]  He, you know, why would you hurt him?
[00:41:57.042 --> 00:41:57.722]  Why would you kill him?
[00:41:57.762 --> 00:41:58.743]  He's just a good guy.
[00:41:59.224 --> 00:42:06.369]  Now, Bill Clinton actually got in trouble for this, and I can't believe I'm defending this man, but this is Bill Clinton, you know, the first black president.
[00:42:06.749 --> 00:42:09.951]  He got in trouble for telling the truth to Black Lives Matter.
[00:42:10.532 --> 00:42:16.116]  Clinton was at a Philadelphia rally a couple of weeks ago when Black Lives Matter protesters confronted him.
[00:42:17.086 --> 00:42:29.734]  I don't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out on the street to murder other African-American children.
[00:42:30.094 --> 00:42:31.835]  Maybe you thought they were good citizens.
[00:42:32.176 --> 00:42:32.636]  She didn't.
[00:42:33.737 --> 00:42:34.197]  She didn't!
[00:42:40.527 --> 00:42:48.369]  See, and that was the big problem, is that Bill Clinton did not denounce the police officers as agents of systemic racism.
[00:42:48.449 --> 00:42:58.792]  Instead, he defended the fact that more of them were even needed on the street, and that many people within the black community were actually thankful for this bill because it was taking a lot of violent criminals off the street.
[00:42:59.092 --> 00:43:03.874]  But in today's Orwellian world, the criminals are actually the victims.
[00:43:04.514 --> 00:43:08.116]  Here's another example of why police officers might be hesitant to do their job.
[00:43:08.136 --> 00:43:13.719]  A video showing an off-duty officer shooting a robbery suspect is prompting criticism.
[00:43:14.139 --> 00:43:21.503]  So here you have this video, you have the eyewitness talking about how a man was going up to rob an older couple.
[00:43:21.583 --> 00:43:22.684]  He pointed a gun at them.
[00:43:23.004 --> 00:43:25.886]  There was an off-duty police officer that witnessed this happening.
[00:43:26.206 --> 00:43:27.647]  He said, freeze, I'm the police.
[00:43:27.947 --> 00:43:31.249]  So then the criminal points the gun at the police officer
[00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:34.111]  And then, of course, what happens?
[00:43:34.231 --> 00:43:35.032]  He gets shot.
[00:43:35.592 --> 00:43:40.997]  Well, the witnesses said, you know, I just don't feel like he had to kill him because he's still young, you know?
[00:43:41.437 --> 00:43:43.699]  He still had a long life ahead of him.
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:45.701]  A life of crime.
[00:43:45.901 --> 00:43:46.402]  I'm sorry.
[00:43:46.482 --> 00:43:52.427]  So just because he was pointing a gun at an old couple, they didn't have enough life ahead of them.
[00:43:52.487 --> 00:43:57.391]  So it was OK if they potentially got shot and killed by someone who chose the life of a criminal.
[00:43:57.471 --> 00:43:59.333]  Therefore, he deals with the consequences.
[00:43:59.853 --> 00:44:01.093]  And then there's the other story.
[00:44:01.894 --> 00:44:03.414]  We reported on this a few weeks ago.
[00:44:03.774 --> 00:44:07.716]  Family of slain burglar complains, how else was he gonna get money?
[00:44:08.136 --> 00:44:15.038]  So this was the sister and a cousin of a black teen who was shot and killed in Miami by a homeowner who was protecting her property.
[00:44:15.738 --> 00:44:17.559]  And here's what they had to say about the break-in.
[00:44:18.579 --> 00:44:23.181]  You have to understand, you have to look at it from every child's point of view that was raised in the hood.
[00:44:23.341 --> 00:44:25.902]  How he gonna get his money to have clothes to go to school.
[00:44:29.753 --> 00:44:39.801]  Crazed violent Bernie Sanders supporters, Black Lives Matter extremists and other leftist agitators crashed a Donald Trump rally in Chicago last night.
[00:44:40.381 --> 00:44:52.271]  Unhinged mobs assaulted people, attacked police, tore up signs, blocked ambulances, fired guns in the air and threatened to rape women.
[00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:57.933]  Oh, but that's just their free speech, cried the media and Bernie Sanders supporters.
[00:44:58.233 --> 00:44:58.734]  Really?
[00:44:59.114 --> 00:45:13.723]  So if Donald Trump voters had crashed a Bernie Sanders event, assaulted his supporters, attacked police, tore up signs, blocked ambulances, fired guns in the air and threatened to rape women, you'd say that was just their free speech?
[00:45:14.505 --> 00:45:18.188]  Look at this Bernie supporter expressing his free speech.
[00:45:18.628 --> 00:45:21.611]  He's an anti-violence activist after all.
[00:45:22.272 --> 00:45:28.176]  Here's another peaceful Bernie voter proudly threatening to physically attack Trump supporters.
[00:45:29.011 --> 00:45:32.533]  Here's a peaceful Bernie supporter flying a communist flag.
[00:45:32.873 --> 00:45:37.857]  A political system responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions of people.
[00:45:38.437 --> 00:45:39.938]  Mmm, so peaceful!
[00:45:40.538 --> 00:45:47.383]  Here are Black Lives Matter supporters wishing that someone had tried to assassinate Trump in Chicago.
[00:45:48.314 --> 00:45:51.536]  Look who showed up to voice his support for the anti-Trump crowd.
[00:45:51.857 --> 00:45:54.318]  Domestic terrorist Bill Ayers.
[00:45:54.959 --> 00:45:57.320]  And who did Megyn Kelly blame for all this?
[00:45:57.921 --> 00:45:58.821]  Donald Trump.
[00:45:59.102 --> 00:46:13.632]  Trump's own rhetoric at his rallies, and in particular, some of the violence we have seen at his rallies, some of the violent clashes with protesters, who often are African American, has fed into what we're seeing here tonight.
[00:46:13.872 --> 00:46:15.413]  Who did Rachel Maddow blame?
[00:46:16.013 --> 00:46:16.794]  Donald Trump.
[00:46:17.514 --> 00:46:30.084]  Before this rally started, when we saw what was happening in the streets outside this event, and we saw what Donald Trump had done to incite violence, and I'm saying that deliberately, to incite violence from his event earlier today in St.
[00:46:30.104 --> 00:46:30.384]  Louis.
[00:46:30.645 --> 00:46:32.066]  Who did Ted Cruz blame?
[00:46:32.586 --> 00:46:33.427]  Donald Trump.
[00:46:34.127 --> 00:46:37.029]  But in any campaign, responsibility starts at the top.
[00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:42.193]  Any candidate is responsible for the culture of the campaign.
[00:46:42.494 --> 00:46:43.855]  You create an environment
[00:46:46.932 --> 00:46:48.113]  Who did Marco Rubio blame?
[00:46:48.133 --> 00:46:51.837]  You guessed it, Donald Trump.

[00:47:07.602 --> 00:47:09.783]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.903 --> 00:47:16.706]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:16.946 --> 00:47:20.207]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.227 --> 00:47:21.408]  You're going to crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.991]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:47:47.031 --> 00:47:53.016]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.

[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:35.299 --> 00:48:37.600]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.701]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:48:41.081 --> 00:48:46.583]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:48:47.023 --> 00:48:53.687]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.

[00:49:04.946 --> 00:49:06.187]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:49:06.227 --> 00:49:09.748]  I'm David Knight and I'm joined with Chuck Untersee and his wife Anita.
[00:49:10.148 --> 00:49:12.189]  We're going to talk about Revelation the Movie.
[00:49:12.409 --> 00:49:14.791]  You can find that at revelationthemovie.info.
[00:49:14.831 --> 00:49:16.651]  You can also get tickets there as well, right?
[00:49:17.312 --> 00:49:26.316]  Yeah, revelationthemovie.info and then one of the icons at the bottom of our homepage has a tickets option and it goes straight to Fandango and Santico Theatres directly.
[00:49:26.556 --> 00:49:34.701]  And that's very important because what I started talking about at the beginning of the hour was how Robert De Niro and the Tribeca Film Festival had shut down Vaxxed.
[00:49:35.021 --> 00:49:41.525]  Robert De Niro personally wanted it, but the lady who was managing it, other filmmakers, wanted to censor that point of view.
[00:49:42.145 --> 00:49:51.029]  Talk to us about why you're going straight to this kind of release, a limited release, to try to show interest in that, and that's what people need to understand.
[00:49:51.049 --> 00:49:56.991]  This is where you can make your voice heard by supporting films like this, like this film.
[00:49:57.411 --> 00:50:00.953]  If it has a high per screen average, then you can begin to get this in more and more screens.
[00:50:00.973 --> 00:50:02.514]  You can get it picked up across the nation.
[00:50:02.854 --> 00:50:08.336]  That's how you get past the gatekeepers at the film festivals and that sort of thing.
[00:50:08.596 --> 00:50:17.260]  Right, we never really even tried film festivals because, well actually we did try a couple of festivals, no names to be mentioned, but we were turned down because of the content.
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:18.681]  They were fully liberal.
[00:50:18.761 --> 00:50:20.081]  Most film festivals are.
[00:50:20.122 --> 00:50:24.183]  You wouldn't even have a chance at Southwest here in Austin.
[00:50:24.223 --> 00:50:24.884]  So the point is,
[00:50:26.144 --> 00:50:27.865]  Far more than the vaccine thing.
[00:50:27.945 --> 00:50:29.387]  I mean, you're not going to find anybody there.
[00:50:29.407 --> 00:50:39.274]  I mean, he got some sympathy there because Robert Nunez had a personal experience with his son who believed had autism because of vaccine connection.
[00:50:39.674 --> 00:50:48.221]  But you're not going to find anybody that wants to run a conservative, libertarian, Christian worldview of the New World Order and the coming world government.
[00:50:48.241 --> 00:50:49.922]  You're not going to find that at any of these film festivals.
[00:50:50.422 --> 00:51:03.730]  I know, and it was the same with people to be in it, but like when we got Charlie, we looked and looked for it, because we did commercials, national commercials for years in L.A., and I know that to market commercials, obviously all corporations find their celebrity spokesman.
[00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:04.791]  Well, you can't find one.
[00:51:04.851 --> 00:51:05.672]  Nobody will stand up.
[00:51:06.112 --> 00:51:16.618]  But in the case of this film, we went, we initially released a version early on called Behold the Pale Horse on DVD, and we thought, well, that's it.
[00:51:16.698 --> 00:51:18.580]  We'll do like everybody else, we'll sell the DVDs.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:19.901]  That'll be that.
[00:51:20.441 --> 00:51:31.396]  And then that was simultaneous when we did that to 2016 coming out being successful and the distributor contacted us and said, hey, this could be the next 2016 theatrically.
[00:51:31.877 --> 00:51:33.099]  Well, what people don't realize is.
[00:51:34.961 --> 00:51:45.549]  The 2016 was the only conservative documentary ever in theaters, and it was super successful because the timing and... That's Dinesh D'Souza's.
[00:51:45.789 --> 00:51:46.650]  Dinesh D'Souza, yeah.
[00:51:50.032 --> 00:51:57.722]  The timing was perfect for them, but it's more perfect for us today with this crescendo of political furor going on with the election.
[00:51:57.742 --> 00:52:00.605]  To release it is a perfect storm to get this message out.
[00:52:01.186 --> 00:52:04.330]  And so, the other issue that is so critical
[00:52:05.211 --> 00:52:14.235]  Is that the American people, or the average Joe, is trained like Pavlov's dogs to get all their information from the news, from television, and regular radio.
[00:52:14.475 --> 00:52:22.039]  And so when they hear a celebrity is involved in something, they see it on TV, they see it in a movie, they think, this is a big deal, we need to pay attention.
[00:52:22.059 --> 00:52:25.920]  So that is the ruse which will make this get our message out.
[00:52:26.401 --> 00:52:31.343]  Because if the Patriot community will act as Paul Revere's
[00:52:31.983 --> 00:52:40.670]  To go out to those great people out there who have a heart for America and know something's wrong but couldn't put their finger on it, then it could really explode.
[00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:44.253]  And I liked your movie much better than Dinesh D'Souza's movie because I thought...
[00:52:44.861 --> 00:52:51.025]  His movie started laying out the case against his thesis for a very, very long time before it ever had any rebuttal.
[00:52:51.765 --> 00:52:54.727]  But, and I thought it kind of drugged as a documentary.
[00:52:54.767 --> 00:52:56.188]  Yours is very fast-paced.
[00:52:56.208 --> 00:53:02.312]  I've seen the whole documentary and it is very, very fast-paced because you continually mix it up with quotes from different people.
[00:53:03.052 --> 00:53:10.657]  You've got the central narrative that's going there through with Charlie Daniels and General Boykin and Alex Jones.
[00:53:11.317 --> 00:53:17.844]  They kind of provide a continuity there, but then you're pulling in people with all these different perspectives on different sub-issues there.
[00:53:18.165 --> 00:53:19.747]  I want to give out the phone number real quickly.
[00:53:19.787 --> 00:53:20.187]  The number is 800-259-9231.
[00:53:20.207 --> 00:53:23.210]  That's 800-259-9231 if you'd like to talk to Chuck Untersee or Anita about this movie that's coming out.
[00:53:31.059 --> 00:53:32.160]  Revelation the Movie.
[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:34.381]  You can find it at revelationthemovie.info.
[00:53:34.602 --> 00:53:39.405]  It's got an opening this Friday, and is it also Saturday in Houston?
[00:53:39.505 --> 00:53:51.193]  It'll be open to the public Friday in Santico Theaters, which is a Texas chain, in Richmond and Tombaugh, which is the western side of Houston, and then subject to, well, it's all on demand.
[00:53:51.213 --> 00:53:53.895]  Any film stays in theaters as long as there's demand.
[00:53:54.415 --> 00:54:03.219]  And so, but the opening weekend is critical because we have now put in place the deal to release it nationally, which would be 2,000 to 3,000 theaters.
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:03.840]  Wow.
[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:10.023]  And so, but still, it has to have a smashing opening weekend to keep those people on the page.
[00:54:10.723 --> 00:54:12.125]  So this is what you can do.
[00:54:12.225 --> 00:54:15.909]  You know, we have filmmakers who want to actually censor information.
[00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:19.093]  They don't want to see at these film festivals like we're talking about with Vax.
[00:54:19.513 --> 00:54:20.875]  They don't want that information out there.
[00:54:21.356 --> 00:54:23.859]  Of course, film festivals don't want a movie like this out there.
[00:54:23.939 --> 00:54:30.607]  But if you want this information to get out, it's basically what you hear here on the Alex Jones Show, but with a documentary film.
[00:54:31.207 --> 00:54:33.870]  You get a context to it that you can't do in the news.
[00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:41.658]  We can't go back and cover how we got here in such detail as you guys can, bring in all these different voices, do it so quickly, cut it tightly.
[00:54:41.698 --> 00:54:44.120]  You just can't do that on a news broadcast.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:52.389]  What we're doing is giving people, okay, here's where we are right now, give them a quick snapshot of it, but you're giving them the whole context, putting it in a historical, political context.
[00:54:52.729 --> 00:54:54.411]  That's what's so valuable about a documentary.
[00:54:54.671 --> 00:54:59.433]  You mentioned a minute ago about how it's cut, and my background was national commercials.
[00:54:59.453 --> 00:55:00.174]  We worked in L.A.
[00:55:00.214 --> 00:55:02.715]  for over 20 years, and I was a director cameraman.
[00:55:02.855 --> 00:55:03.615]  We had our own company.
[00:55:04.396 --> 00:55:12.099]  But, like commercials are cut because people's attention span today is very short, you can cut things very quickly.
[00:55:12.119 --> 00:55:15.801]  I mean, you'd be shocked how much you can get in a 30-second commercial in terms of an edit.
[00:55:16.201 --> 00:55:19.643]  So, we had so much information to relay.
[00:55:20.203 --> 00:55:27.250]  That we had, like I told Alex earlier, we had 42 hours of footage and 38 rock stars of the Patriot community.
[00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:40.482]  So the point was to get all of this information out as quickly as possible but in a comprehensive way so that anyone that watches it, very few people would not grasp something that they're interested in.
[00:55:40.842 --> 00:55:50.947]  And the challenge we have to the people that see it that don't understand what's going on is to get on the internet and every keyword they put in is there when they probably had no idea about any of these issues.
[00:55:51.007 --> 00:55:52.188]  Agenda 21, for instance.
[00:55:52.228 --> 00:55:52.388]  Yeah.
[00:55:52.648 --> 00:55:53.249]  It's all there.
[00:55:53.649 --> 00:56:00.292]  There's nothing new about what we have in the film to the Patriot community, but we want the Patriot community to get it out to those gray people who don't know.
[00:56:00.312 --> 00:56:05.535]  So there's, well, the first time I met Alex, he said, I said, I thought I'm coming to Valhalla and I'm going to get the answer.
[00:56:05.595 --> 00:56:07.616]  I'm going to, I know what's going to, how we solve all this.
[00:56:07.656 --> 00:56:08.537]  And basically he said,
[00:56:09.477 --> 00:56:13.700]  Yeah, he kicked back in his chair and he said, there's two issues, how we're going to fix this.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:18.163]  Wear out your knees praying and education.
[00:56:18.863 --> 00:56:20.284]  And so that's the point of this film.
[00:56:20.504 --> 00:56:27.208]  This film is a tool for patriots to get out to everybody else who everybody's got friends and family who don't get it.
[00:56:27.929 --> 00:56:29.390]  And if they did get it,
[00:56:31.189 --> 00:56:44.696]  You know, a general boy can tell me, I'm a retired Army officer, a general boy can tell me one time, if I tell you to take that hill as an example of what's going on, and you struggle all the way to the top, half the men are dead, and you turn around and look behind you and nobody there, what's the point?
[00:56:44.876 --> 00:56:45.837]  And that's the point.
[00:56:46.037 --> 00:56:47.818]  We have to get Americans
[00:56:49.038 --> 00:56:54.402]  Regular Americans to, you know, look over their shoulder and have a lot of people behind them.
[00:56:54.622 --> 00:56:55.523]  And that's very key.
[00:56:55.683 --> 00:56:59.605]  Just as we're looking at today, the elite are buying bomb-proof luxury survival bunkers.
[00:56:59.625 --> 00:57:00.786]  They're getting out of the cities.
[00:57:00.826 --> 00:57:02.027]  They understand what's going on.
[00:57:02.047 --> 00:57:02.427]  I am too.
[00:57:02.447 --> 00:57:04.068]  At the same time, you are too.
[00:57:04.088 --> 00:57:05.349]  I want to talk to you about that too.
[00:57:05.669 --> 00:57:06.490]  At the same time...
[00:57:07.170 --> 00:57:08.751]  They're concentrating us into the cities.
[00:57:08.971 --> 00:57:16.993]  They're putting technologies in place with the self-driving cars, with the boxes that they're going to put in, that are going to be speaking to the infrastructure.
[00:57:17.013 --> 00:57:20.375]  They talk about it as a vehicle to infrastructure communication.
[00:57:20.395 --> 00:57:21.755]  They're going to mandate those boxes.
[00:57:21.775 --> 00:57:29.078]  They're going to be tracking, taxing, and controlling our movements, confining us into the cities, concentrating us into the cities.
[00:57:31.621 --> 00:57:32.982]  We need to get people to wake up.
[00:57:33.222 --> 00:57:35.903]  We call it Agenda 21 and people's eyes just gloss over.
[00:57:35.963 --> 00:57:44.188]  But one of the ways that you do this is, tell us a little bit about your lifestyle and what you do to decompress after going through these 40 plus hours.
[00:57:44.488 --> 00:57:49.251]  Well you won't see it but Anita will probably reach over and pinch me because she always tells me don't tell people.
[00:57:49.631 --> 00:57:51.052]  But we lived in L.A.
[00:57:51.092 --> 00:57:51.872]  for 23 years.
[00:57:51.892 --> 00:57:52.833]  I'm from East Texas.
[00:57:53.153 --> 00:57:54.294]  Grew up in a rural environment.
[00:57:54.874 --> 00:57:59.616]  And when we moved back here, well, we moved back here because our house burned.
[00:57:59.676 --> 00:58:04.199]  And it was, everybody was wringing their hands, and I'm so sorry, and, you know, patting us on the head.
[00:58:04.219 --> 00:58:05.980]  And it was the happiest day of my life because...
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:11.205]  I was able to see the LA skyline in the rearview mirror of my truck pulling horses back to Texas.
[00:58:11.686 --> 00:58:22.919]  So the point is, I had at that time written a war of secession, Civil War movie script called Rebel Private about Texas during the Civil War and basically had it funded.
[00:58:23.259 --> 00:58:26.523]  And when Obama got in in 08, the people behind it were
[00:58:28.243 --> 00:58:51.649]  Nervous and they said we're gonna put this on hold and that's when we we turned to this and it was a matter of providence was no whole story but the point is we moved back here because of having written that script about Civil War and very into history and my great-great-grandfather in 1860 with the Texas Ranger and and you know it's a long history in Texas since the Texas Revolution point is I was always interested in history so
[00:58:52.756 --> 00:58:53.818]  Well that's it for our show.
[00:58:53.958 --> 00:58:58.167]  I'm Jakari Jackson from the Info Wars Command Center, and we'll see you again tomorrow night.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.001]  Knockout is back.
[00:59:05.341 --> 00:59:16.447]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep, restful sleep, Knockout's it.
