[00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:21.839]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.541]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:23.543]  It's Monday, December 12th, 2016.
[00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:24.485]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:41.348]  The establishment has launched a national emergency to overthrow the election of Donald Trump and turn America into chaos and civil war.
[00:00:41.648 --> 00:00:50.071]  As the power elite now claim it was Russia who rigged the election for Donald Trump and therefore the election does not count.
[00:00:50.612 --> 00:00:52.612]  Then, holy smokes!
[00:00:53.313 --> 00:00:57.474]  Israel wants to export medical marijuana from the Holy Land.
[00:00:57.694 --> 00:00:59.015]  But there is one obstacle.
[00:00:59.815 --> 00:01:00.755]  The United States.
[00:01:01.896 --> 00:01:12.798]  Plus, more evidence that liberalism is a mental disorder, as amnesty groups in California fight to hide the state's criminal and gang database from Donald Trump.
[00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:13.759]  Why?
[00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:15.859]  So they can't be deported.
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.601]  All that plus much more, up next on InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:02.295 --> 00:03:03.379]  Tonight, let's go back.
[00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:06.349]  Not even, well, a little bit over three months ago.
[00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:07.794]  Remember what the topic was at the time?
[00:03:08.385 --> 00:03:17.008]  ZeroHedge pointed out the media is worried that too many Americans will question the legitimacy of the 2016 election and they blame Trump.
[00:03:17.628 --> 00:03:32.994]  Now at the time he pointed out in the wake of Trump's recent rhetoric regarding the rigged system the ruling class of the US is peddling the fiction that somehow Trump's irresponsible sensationalism is solely to blame for the newfound feelings of illegitimacy plaguing our election.
[00:03:33.354 --> 00:03:35.376]  Isn't it amazing that things haven't changed that much?
[00:03:35.696 --> 00:03:41.460]  And of course, at that time, Politico was writing pieces like, what if Trump won't accept defeat?
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.121]  What if the left won't?
[00:03:43.441 --> 00:03:44.742]  What if Hillary Clinton won't?
[00:03:45.303 --> 00:03:51.627]  And of course, she is behind all this, along with George Soros and his color revolutions, that we've seen the same tactics.
[00:03:51.647 --> 00:03:59.133]  We're going to take a look at this, we're going to look at how the CIA, the FBI, and others are pushing this, the lengths at which they're going, because now we've seen
[00:03:59.753 --> 00:04:05.798]  As Jill Stein's attempt to try to question the legitimacy of the election has crashed and burned.
[00:04:05.898 --> 00:04:10.221]  Now they're moving on to the next phase, which involves, of course, the CIA.
[00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:17.826]  They pointed out at the time, according to corporate media, the only reason Americans think their elections are rigged in one way or the other is because Trump said so.
[00:04:18.307 --> 00:04:25.332]  It has nothing to do, he pointed out, with the DNC leaks that showed the Democrats manipulated the corporate media in favor of Hillary Clinton.
[00:04:25.652 --> 00:04:26.993]  That's rigging the election, isn't it?
[00:04:27.393 --> 00:04:28.434]  Oh, let's not pay attention to that.
[00:04:28.714 --> 00:04:32.477]  It has nothing to do with the superdelegates who get to override the voters.
[00:04:32.557 --> 00:04:36.840]  Now they're calling for that to happen with the electors at the Electoral College.
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.585]  It has nothing to do with the Republican establishment choosing to shut down Colorado's primary, handing all the delegates to Ted Cruz again.
[00:04:44.105 --> 00:04:55.909]  What they are now trying to do with the Electoral College, it has nothing to do with the now former DNC Chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, admitting the role of the superdelegates was to fend off grassroots political challengers.
[00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:00.430]  See, we've seen the left, first after the election, say, that's not fair.
[00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:09.153]  We padded the election in particular Democrat states, and she got two million more, two and a half, or whatever the number was they finally finished up with.
[00:05:09.813 --> 00:05:11.494]  We need to shut down the Electoral College.
[00:05:11.554 --> 00:05:18.800]  Now they want to use the Electoral College to shut down the majority winning votes in the states that Trump won, like in Texas.
[00:05:19.693 --> 00:05:21.694]  Now Donald Trump has not been silent about this.
[00:05:21.734 --> 00:05:28.376]  He came out and said, this is a story from Infowars.com, it's a conspiracy theory if we would have said that, isn't it?
[00:05:28.436 --> 00:05:36.019]  He said, can you imagine, this is what he tweeted out, can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and we tried to play the Russia CIA card?
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.180]  It would be called a conspiracy theory.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.840]  Of course it would have.
[00:05:39.261 --> 00:05:44.983]  He says, unless you catch the hackers in the act, it's very hard to determine who was doing the hacking.
[00:05:45.063 --> 00:05:47.424]  Why wasn't this brought up before the election?
[00:05:48.104 --> 00:06:05.142]  We have to ask, why is it that Jill Stein and the rest of the people who are now complaining were completely silent and pouring water, not just silent, but pouring water on any questions about things that would invite fraud systematically into the system?
[00:06:05.723 --> 00:06:08.486]  The things that they've done to shut down voter ID so we can have voter fraud.
[00:06:08.806 --> 00:06:14.192]  The things that they have done to expose us to potential hacking in the electronic voting machines.
[00:06:14.352 --> 00:06:15.513]  Nothing was ever said about that.
[00:06:15.553 --> 00:06:20.299]  And of course Jill Stein admitted that she had no proof that anything had happened and now we see
[00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:25.222]  As the CIA comes out, he says, we have no proof that anything happened, but we should maybe have another election.
[00:06:25.242 --> 00:06:26.023]  We should take a look at this.
[00:06:26.403 --> 00:06:33.608]  He goes on to say, in this election as things stand, this is Steve Watson, absolutely no evidence has been produced to substantiate the claims.
[00:06:33.628 --> 00:06:34.949]  Who needs evidence, okay?
[00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:39.653]  What's more, the FBI has labeled the CIA claims as fuzzy and ambiguous.
[00:06:39.693 --> 00:06:42.675]  In other words, we've been told they're circumstantial at best.
[00:06:43.783 --> 00:06:53.514]  We've been told in the past, this is what they started saying from the beginning, well we know that somebody got into the DNC leaks and we know that Russia uses that same method.
[00:06:54.195 --> 00:06:55.096]  Everybody does.
[00:06:55.476 --> 00:06:56.337]  Any hackers do.
[00:06:56.737 --> 00:06:57.999]  Including our own government.
[00:06:58.419 --> 00:06:59.761]  Uses the same method.
[00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:04.626]  And they all disguise themselves by routing the attempts through various countries.
[00:07:05.347 --> 00:07:08.188]  And then they say, and also Russia had a motive to do this.
[00:07:08.208 --> 00:07:08.928]  Well, you know what?
[00:07:08.968 --> 00:07:11.729]  Having a motive to do something doesn't make you guilty.
[00:07:11.989 --> 00:07:12.930]  Where is the evidence?
[00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.690]  We don't need to see the evidence, they say.
[00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:21.893]  The Washington Post suggests the disagreement between the CIA and the FBI stems from a cultural difference between the two organizations.
[00:07:22.253 --> 00:07:26.054]  They say the FBI, quote, wants facts and tangible evidence to prove something.
[00:07:26.695 --> 00:07:29.216]  Why wouldn't you want that to prove something?
[00:07:29.496 --> 00:07:32.537]  But the CIA is more comfortable just drawing inferences.
[00:07:33.237 --> 00:07:35.838]  Wouldn't that be a conspiracy theory?
[00:07:37.078 --> 00:07:40.940]  It does sound a lot like a conspiracy theory and of course Donald Trump was spot-on.
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:48.462]  It is not just a conspiracy theory that Homeland Security attempted to hack into the Georgia electoral system.
[00:07:48.783 --> 00:07:50.163]  They're now admitted this over the weekend.
[00:07:50.563 --> 00:08:00.567]  Homeland Security told members of Congress on Friday that a rogue federal employee may have been responsible for the November hack attack that targeted the Georgia Secretary of State system.
[00:08:01.367 --> 00:08:02.568]  Oh, so it's not the Russkies.
[00:08:02.628 --> 00:08:07.031]  It can also be our own government, our own homeland security.
[00:08:07.472 --> 00:08:15.758]  And remember, also over the weekend, we learned that the FBI sent plane loads of agents to Iceland to try to frame Julian Assange.
[00:08:16.681 --> 00:08:17.702]  And this was years ago.
[00:08:18.202 --> 00:08:22.725]  This came out in an interview with an Iceland official.
[00:08:22.745 --> 00:08:23.566]  The U.S.
[00:08:23.726 --> 00:08:36.894]  sent plane loads of FBI agents to Iceland in 2011 in order to frame WikiLeaks and its co-founder Julian Assange according to a former Icelandic minister of the interior who refused to cooperate and asked them to stop.
[00:08:36.935 --> 00:08:39.977]  This was back in June of 2011, the Obama administration.
[00:08:39.997 --> 00:08:46.081]  This is a report from RT based on the interview with the interior minister, former interior minister, Jonasson.
[00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:51.643]  He said that they had knowledge of hackers wanting to destroy software systems in the country.
[00:08:51.963 --> 00:08:53.704]  That's what the Obama administration said.
[00:08:54.084 --> 00:08:58.886]  We know about hackers, and we think they have targeted you, so we're going to come and help you.
[00:08:59.487 --> 00:09:00.027]  Sound familiar?
[00:09:00.687 --> 00:09:05.409]  Now, he said he instantly became suspicious, as you, the American voter, should be suspicious.
[00:09:05.729 --> 00:09:11.452]  He says he's well aware that a helping hand might easily become a manipulating hand.
[00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:14.102]  Oh yeah, that says it all, doesn't it?
[00:09:14.422 --> 00:09:21.124]  That is a quote that needs to be enshrined right up there along with Ronald Reagan's, I am from the government and I'm here to help you.
[00:09:22.184 --> 00:09:25.546]  You may not be here to help me, you may be here to manipulate me.
[00:09:25.646 --> 00:09:27.526]  And he knew that was exactly what they were going to do.
[00:09:27.546 --> 00:09:34.689]  They point out, then later that same year, in the summer 2011, the US, he said, sent a plane load of FBI agents to Iceland
[00:09:35.249 --> 00:09:41.775]  Seeking our cooperation, what I understood as an operation to set up and frame Julian Assange and WikiLeaks.
[00:09:41.835 --> 00:09:51.443]  Then he goes on to say, since they had not been authorized by the Icelandic authorities to carry out police work in Iceland, and since a crackdown on WikiLeaks was not on my agenda to say the least,
[00:09:52.043 --> 00:09:55.125]  I ordered that all cooperation with them be promptly terminated.
[00:09:55.565 --> 00:09:59.808]  I also made it clear they should cease all activities in Iceland immediately.
[00:09:59.828 --> 00:10:06.312]  And he goes on to say, if I had to take sides with either WikiLeaks or the FBI or the CIA, I would have no difficulty in choosing.
[00:10:06.332 --> 00:10:08.753]  I would be on the side of WikiLeaks.
[00:10:09.014 --> 00:10:10.094]  Why is that, folks?
[00:10:10.755 --> 00:10:17.119]  Well, it's because all of these protestations about the election and about whistleblowers and about WikiLeaks
[00:10:18.189 --> 00:10:21.912]  All are there to distract you from the crimes that they expose.
[00:10:22.452 --> 00:10:33.260]  See, nobody is talking anymore about what the DNC and what HRC, Hillary Rodham Clinton, did to subvert the elections on the Democrat side.
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:39.485]  Instead, all they want you to focus on is their imaginary boogeyman, the foreigner, the Ruski, who did this.
[00:10:39.525 --> 00:10:44.509]  And of course, we had the British ambassador repeat again and reiterate one more time
[00:10:45.109 --> 00:10:50.530]  That he came to Washington and he met the people who said they released the information.
[00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.371]  That it was Americans who did this because they were tired of the corruption.
[00:10:54.931 --> 00:10:55.811]  See, it's not the Russians.
[00:10:55.911 --> 00:10:56.531]  I don't believe that.
[00:10:56.932 --> 00:10:58.032]  William Binney doesn't believe that.
[00:10:58.072 --> 00:10:58.992]  He has said so as well.
[00:10:59.712 --> 00:11:00.852]  But now we have it stepped up.
[00:11:00.892 --> 00:11:05.473]  We have a former CIA operative calling for a new round of voting again.
[00:11:06.073 --> 00:11:10.174]  He says, intelligence agencies conclude Russia interfered with the elections.
[00:11:10.334 --> 00:11:10.934]  Did they really?
[00:11:11.094 --> 00:11:13.375]  Let's see what he really says, because he doesn't really say that.
[00:11:14.369 --> 00:11:21.995]  He says, if we had been caught interfering in European elections or Asian elections or anywhere around the world, those countries would call for new elections.
[00:11:22.336 --> 00:11:23.557]  Any democracy would.
[00:11:23.637 --> 00:11:26.999]  And of course this is former CIA operative Robert Baer.
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:32.044]  Now, the CIA has been caught interfering in elections.
[00:11:32.064 --> 00:11:36.948]  They've been caught assassinating foreign leaders so they could establish coups in those countries.
[00:11:37.668 --> 00:11:39.570]  But they would never do that here in America, would they?
[00:11:40.796 --> 00:11:44.025]  Well, go back to 1963 for starters, and let's hope that they don't do it again.
[00:11:44.265 --> 00:11:46.932]  And of course, we've seen a lot of former CIA agents.
[00:11:47.813 --> 00:11:49.634]  Get involved in this kind of skullduggery.
[00:11:49.654 --> 00:12:06.078]  For example, the Lieutenant Governor here in Texas, Dewhurst, who spent all of his life working for the CIA for military intelligence, after he became Lieutenant Governor, he did everything he could to shut down the pushback here in Texas against the TSA's violation of our Fourth Amendment.
[00:12:06.198 --> 00:12:06.558]  Remember?
[00:12:06.598 --> 00:12:11.360]  That passed unanimously in the Texas House, and then this former CIA agent, Dewhurst,
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:17.784]  Shut it down in the Senate, even having the federal government say that they would turn Texas into a no-fly zone.
[00:12:17.824 --> 00:12:19.545]  So they use these former CIA agents.
[00:12:19.625 --> 00:12:22.567]  So I guess once a CIA agent, always a CIA agent.
[00:12:23.007 --> 00:12:29.172]  When he expressed where he was pressured, rather, Bayer, about the feasibility of holding another presidential election,
[00:12:30.154 --> 00:12:34.417]  He emphasized that the legitimacy of the government was in doubt.
[00:12:34.437 --> 00:12:35.618]  See, that's what this is all about.
[00:12:36.179 --> 00:12:46.207]  It's about casting aspersion on the legitimacy of the election, on the legitimacy of Donald Trump as president, to portray him as an authoritarian interloper, a foreigner.
[00:12:47.014 --> 00:12:56.601]  That has been the tactic that has been used by Soros's NGOs throughout these color revolutions throughout former Soviet Union, throughout Eastern Europe.
[00:12:56.721 --> 00:12:59.503]  They say, while conceding that he wasn't sure how it would work constitutionally.
[00:12:59.523 --> 00:13:01.265]  I mean, who cares about the Constitution, right?
[00:13:01.285 --> 00:13:02.586]  He's a CIA agent.
[00:13:03.086 --> 00:13:09.588]  They don't care about our constitutional government any more than they care about the constitutional governments that they've overthrown around the world.
[00:13:09.628 --> 00:13:12.648]  And of course the left is standing there applauding this.
[00:13:13.349 --> 00:13:14.449]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:13:14.789 --> 00:13:20.770]  Then he says this, and I think this is very interesting because in this quote he points out that he knows that this is a lie.
[00:13:21.291 --> 00:13:30.713]  I'm deeply disturbed by the fact, he says, the fact that the Russians interfered and I would like to see evidence if the evidence is there.
[00:13:32.065 --> 00:13:36.029]  Now, if it is a fact, then there is evidence.
[00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:41.534]  And if you haven't seen any evidence, if there's evidence there, it's not a fact.
[00:13:42.576 --> 00:13:45.258]  See, this is what is truly disturbing about this.
[00:13:45.779 --> 00:13:51.564]  And at the core of what he's saying, when he's just talking, he lets it slip, almost a Freudian slip.
[00:13:52.265 --> 00:14:00.167]  Showing that it is nothing but a conspiracy theory by the CIA to try to undermine our own elections in this country.
[00:14:00.427 --> 00:14:01.747]  Now understand how this is playing out.
[00:14:02.207 --> 00:14:07.409]  Last Thursday Hillary Clinton blasted what she called the epidemic of fake news.
[00:14:07.469 --> 00:14:11.269]  Now that's significant in terms of the timing we can now see in retrospect.
[00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:13.110]  Because it was last Thursday
[00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:22.320]  As Hillary Clinton was saying, the epidemic of malicious fake news and false propaganda that has flooded social media over the past year is now clear.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.403]  The so-called fake news can have real world consequences.
[00:14:26.304 --> 00:14:29.288]  She said this on Thursday, and as she said it on Thursday,
[00:14:30.572 --> 00:14:43.919]  The Republican and Democrat establishment was putting into the NDAA a measure that would essentially allow the State Department to become the Ministry of Truth, and they passed that the very next day on Friday.
[00:14:43.959 --> 00:14:50.422]  So they quietly, as she was talking about the epidemic of malicious fake news, put this in.
[00:14:50.782 --> 00:14:53.724]  Now, those of you who have been watching us for a number of years,
[00:14:54.335 --> 00:14:56.376]  Know that this goes back several years.
[00:14:56.996 --> 00:15:10.264]  It was 2013 that they removed the prohibition of Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, repealing the Smith-Munt Act, which prohibited them from propagandizing here in America on the media.
[00:15:11.084 --> 00:15:11.344]  I don't know.
[00:15:29.551 --> 00:15:34.134]  What they had to do was they had to insert Donald Trump here because they have to come after him.
[00:15:34.894 --> 00:15:39.157]  But if Hillary Clinton had won, they would have done the same thing that they are now doing.
[00:15:39.677 --> 00:15:47.903]  You have to understand, Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio who first endorsed Donald Trump and then, as an October surprise, said, I'm unendorsing him.
[00:15:47.963 --> 00:15:49.103]  I can't endorse this guy.
[00:15:49.284 --> 00:15:52.326]  He is the guy who wrote this fake news.
[00:15:53.126 --> 00:15:53.386]  Bill.
[00:15:53.967 --> 00:15:54.908]  And of course, what is this?
[00:15:54.928 --> 00:15:57.270]  They're going to come up with fact-based narratives.
[00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:04.658]  They're going to spend $180 million to create a global engagement center under the oversight of the State Department.
[00:16:05.019 --> 00:16:08.682]  And they're going to fund and train, train local journalists.
[00:16:09.143 --> 00:16:10.644]  Does that cause you concern?
[00:16:11.205 --> 00:16:14.969]  The idea that our government, our federal government, is going to train journalists?
[00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:17.071]  How insane is that?
[00:16:17.091 --> 00:16:19.193]  This is their own description.
[00:16:19.213 --> 00:16:31.964]  They're going to provide grants and contracts to NGOs like the ones that have been used in color revolutions by George Soros, civil society organizations, think tanks, private sector companies, media organizations, other experts outside of the US government.
[00:16:32.785 --> 00:16:34.907]  They're not outside of the US government.
[00:16:35.267 --> 00:16:37.089]  They are representatives of the US government.
[00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:40.091]  And then look at this other rhetoric that we have here.
[00:16:40.131 --> 00:16:44.575]  CNN's Stelter says Trump win is a national emergency.
[00:16:45.116 --> 00:16:49.440]  They're trying to create the conditions for a civil war.
[00:16:50.583 --> 00:16:56.005]  And again, it begins with the illegitimacy of the election that they must establish with the press.
[00:16:56.085 --> 00:17:00.967]  And in order to do that, they must shut down independent free thought.
[00:17:01.587 --> 00:17:04.829]  Social media, independent media, that all has to be shut down.
[00:17:05.249 --> 00:17:06.950]  And again, look at the language that they use.
[00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:10.171]  Trump's win undermined our democracy, he says.
[00:17:10.711 --> 00:17:17.114]  He says that's the ultimate goal of Russian disinformation, to undermine democracy, to undermine faith in our institutions like the media.
[00:17:17.952 --> 00:17:20.294]  Now we're back to where we were in August.
[00:17:20.794 --> 00:17:31.142]  Remember, it was Donald Trump who was undermining the integrity of our elections when he says, hey, we've got some systemic problems here that we ought to take a look at and do something about it before the election.
[00:17:31.282 --> 00:17:32.743]  Oh, no, no, no.
[00:17:32.883 --> 00:17:35.665]  Don't you dare question how we conduct elections.
[00:17:36.085 --> 00:17:37.506]  You'll be undermining our democracy.
[00:17:37.587 --> 00:17:42.230]  And now they are coming after the very foundations of our elections and our Constitution.
[00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:47.154]  We see that a congressman is now begging the Electoral College voters to block Trump
[00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:49.818]  This is a Democrat congressman from Connecticut.
[00:17:49.858 --> 00:17:54.561]  He says we're five weeks from the inauguration and President-elect is completely unhinged.
[00:17:54.922 --> 00:17:55.282]  Why?
[00:17:55.782 --> 00:18:01.106]  Because he said the NBC nightly news is biased, inaccurate, and bad, point after point.
[00:18:01.126 --> 00:18:01.767]  He tweeted that out.
[00:18:02.107 --> 00:18:05.610]  Now, that would be the NBC news that had Brian Williams as anchor.
[00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.652]  Nobody would ever think that Brian Williams was inaccurate, would we?
[00:18:10.393 --> 00:18:18.279]  He is the poster child for the fake media, and now he is the person they're using to criticize so-called fake media, which is really independent media.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:23.723]  Electors are now saying that they want a briefing on the Russian interference before the Electoral College vote.
[00:18:23.743 --> 00:18:25.105]  So now they want these same people
[00:18:25.825 --> 00:18:28.507]  That tried to frame Julian Assange in Iceland.
[00:18:29.127 --> 00:18:31.149]  The same people that have overthrown other governments.
[00:18:31.189 --> 00:18:41.476]  They want them to come in and give them a portrayal of this fake news for which there is no evidence according to Robert Baer, former CIA official.
[00:18:42.016 --> 00:18:43.617]  This is what we are now facing.
[00:18:43.657 --> 00:18:44.538]  Stay with us when we come back.
[00:18:44.558 --> 00:18:49.862]  We're going to take a look at the next line of attack and that is to say Donald Trump has a conflict of interest problem.
[00:18:50.282 --> 00:18:53.769]  Rand Paul pointed out this weekend, hey, you knew he had a lot of businesses when you voted for him.
[00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:54.832]  That's a bit unfair.
[00:18:55.092 --> 00:18:57.277]  Stay with us, Leanne, and I won't break that down when we come back.
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:46.203]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:19:46.884 --> 00:19:48.465]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:19:48.865 --> 00:19:53.848]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:19:54.208 --> 00:19:59.652]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:20:00.052 --> 00:20:06.636]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:20:07.277 --> 00:20:08.438]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:20:09.278 --> 00:20:11.219]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.501]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:20:14.942 --> 00:20:18.564]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:20:18.744 --> 00:20:21.306]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:20:21.366 --> 00:20:33.714]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:20:33.934 --> 00:20:39.055]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:40.496]  It's bound.
[00:20:40.776 --> 00:20:41.776]  It's not absorbable.
[00:20:42.196 --> 00:20:42.616]  I tried it.
[00:20:43.197 --> 00:20:46.758]  And I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:20:46.978 --> 00:20:51.879]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:20:52.239 --> 00:20:55.940]  It's such a game changer if you'll just research iodine for yourself.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.681]  It's a fact that the federal government in the Midwest back in the 20s
[00:20:59.241 --> 00:21:08.206]  Mandated a grungier form of iodine to the salt because people had low IQs, they had huge goiters, major problems directly connected to it.
[00:21:08.386 --> 00:21:12.048]  There are some studies that show a 15 point increase, others show even higher.
[00:21:12.208 --> 00:21:25.656]  But it really is crazy to realize that this is something that is so deficient in our food chain, so deficient in our played out fields where different crops are being grown, but the federal government isn't educating people and telling them about it.
[00:21:25.856 --> 00:21:37.399]  That's why for a limited time, I want to encourage everyone to go to Infowarslife.com and get 20% off on the best nascent iodine out there from our research, Truly Pure Survival Shield X2.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.260]  Again, that's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.461]  Thank you for joining us in this brief news update.
[00:21:43.841 --> 00:21:48.743]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:21:48.823 --> 00:21:49.983]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:52.724]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[00:21:52.884 --> 00:21:53.104]  Of course!
[00:22:15.742 --> 00:22:18.343]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:22:18.363 --> 00:22:19.404]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:22:19.744 --> 00:22:20.444]  Iodine is key.
[00:22:20.484 --> 00:22:21.104]  You must have it.
[00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:29.008]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield niacin iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:22:29.028 --> 00:22:29.889]  We can answer your questions.
[00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:30.249]  888-253-3139.
[00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:32.630]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[00:22:43.925 --> 00:22:45.387]  It's a fight for our minds.
[00:22:46.048 --> 00:22:47.971]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[00:22:48.311 --> 00:22:52.517]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:22:52.657 --> 00:22:56.002]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[00:22:56.082 --> 00:22:57.644]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:23:06.823 --> 00:23:12.911]  The latest effort to delegitimize Donald Trump is to point out all of the potential conflicts of interest.
[00:23:13.331 --> 00:23:21.702]  Now it's true we've never had a president elect with such a vast global empire, many possibilities and opportunities to mix business with pleasure.
[00:23:22.182 --> 00:23:30.664]  Now, for his part, Donald Trump has said that he's going to be putting all of his assets in a blind trust and handing over control to his children to take over his businesses.
[00:23:31.104 --> 00:23:33.585]  But even that has some issues, and we're going to get to that.
[00:23:33.645 --> 00:23:35.006]  Now, Owen Schroer joins me.
[00:23:35.406 --> 00:23:38.867]  We're going to take a look at the latest big outrage here.
[00:23:38.887 --> 00:23:39.447]  I know
[00:23:40.447 --> 00:23:47.349]  Friday, kind of over the weekend, a lot of people were talking about Donald Trump is going to work on Celebrity Apprentice in his spare time.
[00:23:47.429 --> 00:23:49.510]  Now, obviously, he's the executive producer.
[00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:52.891]  He's the one that helped to come up with the idea for the show.
[00:23:53.471 --> 00:23:57.513]  But people don't understand there's many different positions that an executive producer would do.
[00:23:57.633 --> 00:23:59.633]  Frankly, he's just there to write the checks.
[00:24:00.174 --> 00:24:03.715]  He's going to spend zero time on Celebrity Apprentice.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.481]  But they're trying to make this into some huge scandal.
[00:24:07.222 --> 00:24:12.006]  You know, it's not as if he's going to be out playing golf four hours a day, 365 days a week.
[00:24:12.506 --> 00:24:14.047]  Oh, no president's ever done that.
[00:24:14.567 --> 00:24:14.788]  Right.
[00:24:15.008 --> 00:24:17.710]  Well, I'm not surprised that The Apprentice would want him back.
[00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:21.733]  If you recall, he saved that television series from going completely under.
[00:24:22.333 --> 00:24:27.939]  Um, but as far as his role is concerned, um, like you said, I don't think it'll be something that takes away too much of his time.
[00:24:27.999 --> 00:24:29.420]  At least I would hope.
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:32.724]  I mean, as somebody that supports Trump, that he, you know, pushes that off.
[00:24:32.744 --> 00:24:36.407]  He said he's not going to put all of his business interests on to the daytime, right?
[00:24:36.427 --> 00:24:41.813]  Talk the nightly talk shows like President Obama and his spare time when they've got people being beheaded.
[00:24:42.253 --> 00:24:43.994]  But isn't that what this is all about, Leigh-Anne?
[00:24:44.175 --> 00:24:45.956]  This is all about double standards here.
[00:24:46.236 --> 00:24:47.357]  That's what we're talking about.
[00:24:47.918 --> 00:24:54.924]  And another double standard that I'm seeing is people talking about foreign influence in our election.
[00:24:54.964 --> 00:24:57.526]  We need to be concerned about foreign influence.
[00:24:57.806 --> 00:24:58.767]  Well now, hold on a second.
[00:24:59.881 --> 00:25:01.522]  Let's take a look at the Clinton Foundation.
[00:25:01.582 --> 00:25:03.803]  You want to talk about foreign influence.
[00:25:04.323 --> 00:25:08.004]  How about all of the foreign money that the Clinton Foundation has taken?
[00:25:08.064 --> 00:25:11.305]  Now, we've got a lot of stories, but here's just a few examples.
[00:25:11.686 --> 00:25:17.968]  Because since we're concerned about foreign influence with the Russians, let's look at some of the foreign influence that Hillary Clinton is under.
[00:25:18.468 --> 00:25:19.950]  Saudi Arabian influence.
[00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:25.535]  The foundation disclosed that Saudi Arabia donated between 10 and 25 million dollars.
[00:25:26.296 --> 00:25:34.504]  The foundation received an additional 1 to 5 million dollar donation from the Friends of Saudi Arabia, which was co-founded by a Saudi Arabian prince.
[00:25:34.925 --> 00:25:36.206]  How about the Moroccan king?
[00:25:37.467 --> 00:25:43.789]  Clinton arranged for her foundation to host a meeting in Morocco in return for a $12 million donation from the country's king.
[00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:52.271]  The donation came from a Moroccan state-owned mining company, which later received a $92 million loan guarantee while Clinton served as Secretary of State.
[00:25:52.291 --> 00:25:54.251]  So a little pay-for-play there.
[00:25:54.671 --> 00:25:58.032]  And then you've got the Russian, oh, Russian influence!
[00:25:58.352 --> 00:26:00.833]  How about the Russian influence on the Clintons?
[00:26:01.753 --> 00:26:06.616]  Canadian leaders of a mining company funneled millions of dollars to the foundation while Clinton served as Secretary of State.
[00:26:06.676 --> 00:26:10.979]  At the same time, they needed Department of State approval for the sale of their company to Russia.
[00:26:11.019 --> 00:26:11.919]  How convenient!
[00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:19.824]  The Clinton State Department approved that deal, which gave Russia control of one-fifth of the entire uranium supply in the United States.
[00:26:20.164 --> 00:26:30.110]  The chairman of the uranium mining company donated $2.35 million to the Clinton Foundation without any disclosure from the Clintons, and then just to put a nice bow on it,
[00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:39.077]  After Russia announced its intention to make a bid for the uranium mining company, former President Bill Clinton was paid half a million dollars to deliver a speech in Moscow.
[00:26:39.097 --> 00:26:41.799]  You've also got the Indonesian tobacco pay-for-play.
[00:26:42.099 --> 00:26:43.940]  So there's your foreign influence, folks.
[00:26:44.301 --> 00:26:50.866]  You want to sit here and complain about foreign influence on the election, where have you been for the last decades with the Clinton campaign?
[00:26:51.294 --> 00:26:54.138]  Right, and so they're kind of testing this outrage.
[00:26:54.179 --> 00:26:59.447]  Where was the outrage when we were trying to point out all of the conflicts of interest with the Clinton Foundation?
[00:27:00.328 --> 00:27:06.398]  Her biggest contributions there came from people who had business dealings in front of the State Department.
[00:27:06.738 --> 00:27:21.657]  So, like you talked about, it's the pay-for-play, and the entire time that Hillary Clinton was out there on the campaign trail, all the establishment media was really going the extra mile to tell everyone that there was no issues there, no conflict of interest, but now it's a huge deal.
[00:27:22.037 --> 00:27:28.543]  That we have foreign diplomats apparently lining up to do business at Trump's DC hotel.
[00:27:28.603 --> 00:27:29.824]  They're saying, well, this is crazy.
[00:27:29.864 --> 00:27:32.627]  Donald Trump's business dealings are going to test a constitutional limit.
[00:27:33.027 --> 00:27:34.529]  We have all these foreign governments.
[00:27:35.089 --> 00:27:39.454]  There's actually a Chinese company that holds a lease in one of his buildings.
[00:27:39.494 --> 00:27:42.116]  And so when the lease is up, you know, what are they going to do?
[00:27:42.156 --> 00:27:43.938]  Is that going to be a potential conflict of interest?
[00:27:44.458 --> 00:27:46.020]  And so now there's all of this
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:46.841]  I don't know.
[00:28:01.477 --> 00:28:01.857]  I don't know.
[00:28:18.066 --> 00:28:27.189]  This girl has done, throughout her entire career, she was paid $600,000 plus an annual salary to go be an analyst on NBC.
[00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:29.390]  She appeared on there maybe, what, three times?
[00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:37.172]  So she got paid $600,000, so almost a million dollars by the time her contract ended, of course.
[00:28:38.252 --> 00:28:45.495]  But, you know, she was completely in charge of the Clinton Foundation, her mother said, and she actually, this was something that they said that she
[00:28:47.076 --> 00:29:02.825]  She violated the spirit of the ethics pledge that she took when she said that she would, for the duration of the appointment as Secretary, if I'm confirmed, I will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter involving specific parties, in which the Clinton Foundation, da da da da da.
[00:29:03.245 --> 00:29:11.210]  But now we know that that's not true because she went out of her way to help a lot of her donors get job offers and job opportunities.
[00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:13.952]  Um, and it was, like you said, a lot of pay to play.
[00:29:13.972 --> 00:29:19.975]  A lobbyist with the group Public Citizen said the Clinton Foundation was taking money from anybody who would give it.
[00:29:20.276 --> 00:29:23.978]  The biggest contributions were from people who had business before the State Department.
[00:29:24.698 --> 00:29:26.760]  These were donors to the family charity.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:32.463]  Of course, they called it a charity to have it be a tax exemption.
[00:29:32.543 --> 00:29:34.625]  They ended up only giving, you know, what,
[00:29:35.345 --> 00:29:35.865]  I don't know.
[00:29:53.919 --> 00:29:54.659]  But how about this?
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:59.202]  Corporate board positions as well with companies run by her parents which support her.
[00:29:59.222 --> 00:30:01.903]  So she's getting all these job positions on the board.
[00:30:02.043 --> 00:30:08.606]  Oh Chelsea here because they really truly felt that Hillary Clinton would be the president and they were trying to you know get their foot in the door with her.
[00:30:08.786 --> 00:30:18.391]  And let's be perfectly clear you know is if you're doing things legally and you're moving money around or you know you got charities and all this we're not complaining about that okay at least I'm not.
[00:30:19.011 --> 00:30:20.652]  I'm complaining about corruption.
[00:30:21.172 --> 00:30:22.273]  That's my problem.
[00:30:22.353 --> 00:30:23.614]  Corruption is my problem.
[00:30:23.674 --> 00:30:28.337]  And then on top of that, the double standards that they want to initiate when they look at Donald Trump.
[00:30:28.357 --> 00:30:29.577]  But how's this for irony, Leanne?
[00:30:29.998 --> 00:30:34.841]  More than half of Clinton Foundation's major donors would be barred under a new rule.
[00:30:35.241 --> 00:30:36.302]  Now tell me if you believe this.
[00:30:37.162 --> 00:30:46.787]  Now, as I just said, more than half the Clinton Foundation's major donors would be prevented from contributing to the charity under the self-imposed ban on corporate and foreign donors, the Foundation said this week.
[00:30:47.007 --> 00:30:47.967]  This is an older story.
[00:30:48.548 --> 00:30:50.789]  If Hillary Clinton won the White House.
[00:30:50.829 --> 00:30:52.129]  Now, first of all, she didn't.
[00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:55.751]  But second of all, I don't believe that for one second.
[00:30:55.811 --> 00:30:57.712]  They're not going to bite the hand that feeds them.
[00:30:58.132 --> 00:31:01.994]  This is the most corrupt Foundation possibly ever.
[00:31:02.254 --> 00:31:02.955]  And it goes on.
[00:31:03.962 --> 00:31:09.283]  Clinton Foundation Charity failed to disclose a quarter of a billion dollars in foreign government donations.
[00:31:09.624 --> 00:31:17.746]  The Clinton Health Access Initiative failed to list a quarter of a billion dollars in contributions.
[00:31:17.786 --> 00:31:22.247]  That is according to a research done by a government watchdog.
[00:31:23.127 --> 00:31:24.608]  Let me quote the exact person here.
[00:31:25.008 --> 00:31:25.928]  John Wunderlich
[00:31:26.368 --> 00:31:29.189]  He heads the Sunlight Foundation, which is a government watchdog.
[00:31:29.489 --> 00:31:41.634]  He says, even if there had been other organizations that failed to disclose their foreign donors, that's not an excuse for the Clinton Foundation to not disclose their foreign donors, and it is not an excuse for Schneiderman's office to fail to enforce the law.
[00:31:41.674 --> 00:31:44.435]  Schneiderman was in the New York government when the Clintons were doing this.
[00:31:44.475 --> 00:31:45.536]  So how's that for irony?
[00:31:45.916 --> 00:31:46.656]  Well, absolutely.
[00:31:46.736 --> 00:31:51.378]  And so here again, you know, they're really talking about what a powerful position Ivanka is going to have.
[00:31:51.418 --> 00:32:01.680]  They're saying, you know, it's easy to envision scenarios where other countries are going to be using Trump's children as a conduit to funnel money his way, which, of course, we've seen with Chelsea Clinton.
[00:32:02.121 --> 00:32:03.961]  That is not illegal, though.
[00:32:04.101 --> 00:32:05.382]  Unfortunately, it's not illegal.
[00:32:05.582 --> 00:32:08.242]  The president is exempt from conflict of interest laws.
[00:32:08.282 --> 00:32:10.043]  But what they're trying to go after him now
[00:32:10.723 --> 00:32:11.184]  Yes, we are.
[00:32:27.959 --> 00:32:31.822]  So now they're really going to be using these obscure clauses to really go after Donald Trump.
[00:32:31.862 --> 00:32:41.888]  And as we can see, like you mentioned before, I know you and Margaret are going to be talking a little bit about Russia coming up next, but they're really going to take this all the way to inauguration day.
[00:32:41.988 --> 00:32:47.712]  And there really is no backpedaling, but at least, hey, the media is finally doing their job and checking those in power.
[00:32:47.932 --> 00:32:48.893]  But only when it's Trump.
[00:32:49.253 --> 00:32:51.215]  Yes, when it's Donald Trump.
[00:32:51.235 --> 00:32:51.975]  So you know what?
[00:32:52.015 --> 00:32:53.956]  But we're going to continue checking Donald Trump as well.
[00:32:54.437 --> 00:32:56.538]  He is not exempt from the info war.
[00:32:56.878 --> 00:32:57.539]  Stay tuned for more.
[00:32:57.739 --> 00:32:57.824]  Yeah.
[00:33:02.435 --> 00:33:07.218]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[00:33:07.418 --> 00:33:08.999]  I ran six miles almost every day.
[00:33:09.019 --> 00:33:11.840]  I would lift weights four or five days a week for up to three hours.
[00:33:12.401 --> 00:33:16.983]  I was really into what I was doing, but I also loved to go to buffets and pig out.
[00:33:17.023 --> 00:33:17.704]  I was a young man.
[00:33:18.304 --> 00:33:20.345]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down.
[00:33:20.726 --> 00:33:21.686]  I quit working out.
[00:33:21.766 --> 00:33:27.069]  I was working 18 hours a day, many days, on average about 14, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:33.652]  I went from 180 to right up to 280 pounds.
[00:33:33.832 --> 00:33:36.753]  And I started to exercise really hard again.
[00:33:37.173 --> 00:33:38.753]  And I started to try to eat healthier.
[00:33:39.233 --> 00:33:41.414]  But for some reason, I couldn't lose more than 20 pounds.
[00:33:41.494 --> 00:33:43.895]  Couldn't go below about 259.
[00:33:45.075 --> 00:33:46.716]  Started taking third-party supplements.
[00:33:47.116 --> 00:33:48.936]  Started seeing some more gains.
[00:33:49.457 --> 00:33:56.899]  But when I started working with Dr. Grip and some of the other top formulators in the country, they said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that
[00:33:57.319 --> 00:33:59.720]  The population is absolutely deficient in.
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:06.463]  Take this true atomic iodine that they were just developing and wasn't even available in stores yet.
[00:34:07.123 --> 00:34:07.464]  Boom!
[00:34:08.184 --> 00:34:09.625]  Weight started pouring off.
[00:34:09.725 --> 00:34:11.605]  Toxins started coming out of my body.
[00:34:12.106 --> 00:34:12.926]  It was incredible.
[00:34:12.966 --> 00:34:18.548]  Then I started taking DNA force, super male vitality, and I went down to 230 pounds.
[00:34:18.568 --> 00:34:24.111]  Now understand, that's losing 60, 70 pounds of fat and gaining, I don't know, 20 pounds of muscle?
[00:34:25.086 --> 00:34:25.406]  All I know
[00:34:44.918 --> 00:34:54.265]  But more importantly, I stopped taking the supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[00:34:54.365 --> 00:34:55.326]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[00:34:55.526 --> 00:35:02.051]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put Lazy Susan back on the table and I'm going to start taking it religiously again.
[00:35:02.851 --> 00:35:06.074]  And I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[00:35:06.114 --> 00:35:07.395]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[00:35:07.996 --> 00:35:12.059]  And I've already experienced what this has done before, but this time we're going to document it.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:16.063]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[00:35:16.624 --> 00:35:20.187]  My gut tells me I'll lose at least 10 pounds even during the holidays.
[00:35:20.567 --> 00:35:45.424]  Taking the supplements because again, it's what I've experienced before but we're gonna see I'm gonna work out just the same probably eat even more But I'm gonna take the x2 the DNA force the super male every single day as it's recommended And we're all gonna see the results look we're making America great again We're restoring the Republic and part of that is making ourselves great again our bodies great again and feeling good about ourselves I don't plan to be some Beach Boy
[00:35:46.164 --> 00:35:48.205]  I've got kind of bodybuilder form.
[00:35:48.225 --> 00:35:48.785]  I'm a big guy.
[00:35:49.085 --> 00:35:53.966]  But we're going to see what happens in the next 30 days together on this journey.
[00:35:53.986 --> 00:35:56.427]  And we'll have updates every week on what's happening.
[00:35:57.147 --> 00:36:04.529]  And we will also then obviously take the four weeks and put it all together in a special report that's going to air January 5th.
[00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:06.330]  Now, I'll be frank with you.
[00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:07.710]  I'm still having treats.
[00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:09.131]  I'm still living like I normally do.
[00:36:09.371 --> 00:36:10.591]  This wasn't part of what we were about to do.
[00:36:10.631 --> 00:36:11.732]  And I'm not saying it's good.
[00:36:12.052 --> 00:36:12.792]  I'm embarrassed of it.
[00:36:14.249 --> 00:36:14.929]  Mexican Coke.
[00:36:15.409 --> 00:36:17.010]  Buckley's over there and he made the joke earlier.
[00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:19.271]  Oh yeah, you're really going to lose weight drinking Mexican Coke.
[00:36:19.611 --> 00:36:20.912]  I'm just being totally transparent.
[00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:21.892]  I'm going to eat pie.
[00:36:22.252 --> 00:36:22.973]  Christmas is coming up.
[00:36:23.013 --> 00:36:24.953]  I'm going to eat ham and turkey.
[00:36:26.374 --> 00:36:26.934]  I'm telling you.
[00:36:27.514 --> 00:36:27.995]  I'm telling you.
[00:36:28.655 --> 00:36:36.358]  These nutraceuticals have really spoiled me because I work out less and was just losing weight.
[00:36:37.779 --> 00:36:38.440]  As long as I took them.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.281]  Then when I quit taking them, I've gained some weight.
[00:36:40.321 --> 00:36:41.642]  So we're going to see what happens.
[00:36:41.702 --> 00:36:43.183]  But I've experienced this.
[00:36:43.203 --> 00:36:45.384]  You need to experience this for yourself.
[00:36:45.505 --> 00:36:46.425]  It's December 5, 2016.
[00:36:46.545 --> 00:36:50.148]  We're only like 25 days from 2017.
[00:36:51.129 --> 00:37:00.836]  And I want to invite all of the InfoWarriors of every race, color, and creed that bleed red blood and love liberty, justice, and truth to make our bodies great again.
[00:37:07.637 --> 00:37:12.038]  There's an all-out war going on to take down Donald Trump by any means necessary.
[00:37:12.138 --> 00:37:14.018]  I'm joined in studio now by Owen Schroyer.
[00:37:14.038 --> 00:37:16.619]  We're going to be talking about all the different angles to this, Owen.
[00:37:17.119 --> 00:37:26.021]  And we've got senators on board, government agencies, the Electoral College, you name it, it is like every possible angle imaginable.
[00:37:26.321 --> 00:37:28.281]  We're five weeks away from his inauguration.
[00:37:28.641 --> 00:37:29.861]  What do you make of these stories?
[00:37:29.941 --> 00:37:32.342]  I mean, we came into the office today, I'm like, is this really happening?
[00:37:32.662 --> 00:37:33.742]  Well, it's an all-out assault.
[00:37:33.962 --> 00:37:38.664]  We still don't know what other angles they might take, including physical measures.
[00:37:39.064 --> 00:37:46.587]  But the craziest thing today, and you put this story on my desk, Mitch McConnell backs investigation into Russian hacking.
[00:37:46.647 --> 00:37:47.847]  McCain calls it warfare.
[00:37:47.927 --> 00:37:48.607]  Trump denies.
[00:37:48.647 --> 00:37:57.010]  Now, I actually was listening to Mitch McConnell when he made the statement this morning, and including the quote, the Russians are not our friends.
[00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:59.611]  He was very demeaning of Russia.
[00:38:00.191 --> 00:38:07.337]  He was very, now he didn't want to make any concrete statements much like what we've seen from a lot of this.
[00:38:07.397 --> 00:38:10.660]  It's just kind of a lot of suspected we have evidence but they don't really have the evidence.
[00:38:11.601 --> 00:38:21.890]  But he did stand very clear on the fact that Russian influence was part of this election and that Russians are not our friends.
[00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:25.193]  So these are two things that are very anti-Russia.
[00:38:25.373 --> 00:38:28.976]  Baseless claims and the media is running wild with it.
[00:38:29.036 --> 00:38:33.479]  Not only is the media running wild with it, but we have, you know, Senators like McConnell and McCain.
[00:38:33.779 --> 00:38:37.282]  McCain cited in this New York Times article calling it, quote, warfare.
[00:38:37.622 --> 00:38:38.163]  Warfare?
[00:38:38.423 --> 00:38:39.343]  Really, folks?
[00:38:39.504 --> 00:38:43.967]  I mean, we're talking about a situation that has been proven to be debunked, frankly.
[00:38:44.767 --> 00:38:46.128]  Alex covered this on the show.
[00:38:46.469 --> 00:38:48.710]  Of course, I'm talking about the hacking of the DNC.
[00:38:49.431 --> 00:38:51.893]  They've been claiming that the Russians have been doing it forever.
[00:38:52.293 --> 00:38:53.635]  Turns out, not true.
[00:38:53.655 --> 00:39:01.424]  We have a UK ambassador, you and I talked about this story this morning prior to getting on the air, who actually said, look, I met the DNC hacker.
[00:39:01.464 --> 00:39:02.445]  He's not a Russian.
[00:39:02.465 --> 00:39:08.652]  You know, he was somebody that was burned about Bernie Sanders and having, you know, that stolen from him and decided to leak this information.
[00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:10.374]  It has nothing to do with Russia.
[00:39:10.695 --> 00:39:12.617]  And the fact that they keep hammering Russia, we've got
[00:39:12.737 --> 00:39:12.937]  Oh really?
[00:39:12.977 --> 00:39:13.337]  Oh really?
[00:39:33.103 --> 00:39:38.365]  Well let's be clear, I went to a ton, I mean dozens of Donald Trump rallies, okay?
[00:39:38.806 --> 00:39:41.707]  There were thousands and thousands of Americans there.
[00:39:42.107 --> 00:39:44.688]  I didn't see Russians showing up to Donald Trump rallies.
[00:39:44.748 --> 00:39:46.829]  I might have run into a few Russians here or there, but no.
[00:39:47.089 --> 00:39:49.530]  The point is it was the American people that got Donald Trump elected.
[00:39:50.131 --> 00:39:54.893]  And why they want to start, it's weird, it's like they really want this war with Russia.
[00:39:55.653 --> 00:40:05.027]  Even getting Trump in, you're still going to have people now from the Republican establishment like McConnell trying to drum up this war, this anti-Russia rhetoric.
[00:40:05.047 --> 00:40:07.491]  His wife was named the Secretary of Labor, I believe.
[00:40:07.511 --> 00:40:09.154]  Which I don't like that.
[00:40:09.194 --> 00:40:10.355]  I don't understand that move.
[00:40:11.016 --> 00:40:11.397]  I don't either.
[00:40:29.696 --> 00:40:30.597]  I don't
[00:40:48.351 --> 00:40:53.615]  For allegedly hacking the DNC emails, the Podesta emails and getting them out to WikiLeaks.
[00:40:53.955 --> 00:40:55.837]  But what happened with the WikiLeaks emails?
[00:40:56.317 --> 00:40:58.198]  Of course they would have influenced the election.
[00:40:58.539 --> 00:40:59.439]  What was exposed?
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:02.562]  Corruption within the Clinton campaign.
[00:41:02.842 --> 00:41:04.543]  Corruption within John Podesta.
[00:41:04.583 --> 00:41:05.964]  Corruption within the DNC.
[00:41:06.184 --> 00:41:09.667]  So I'm supposed to be mad at the Russians for exposing corruption?
[00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:11.368]  And then let's take it one step further.
[00:41:11.388 --> 00:41:11.809]  Okay.
[00:41:12.549 --> 00:41:15.292]  This hacking from the Russians actually happened.
[00:41:15.672 --> 00:41:21.117]  Shouldn't we be concerned about the classified documents that Hillary Clinton had on a unprotected server?
[00:41:21.397 --> 00:41:22.658]  What happened to that whole argument?
[00:41:22.958 --> 00:41:25.000]  So they can't have their cake and eat it too here, Margaret.
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:25.541]  What gets me?
[00:41:25.621 --> 00:41:28.884]  So the fact that they're claiming now that it was a hack on our democracy...
[00:41:29.224 --> 00:41:31.546]  It wasn't a hack on our democracy.
[00:41:31.586 --> 00:41:33.527]  Leave our democracy out of this, frankly.
[00:41:33.547 --> 00:41:38.150]  It was a hack on corrupt Democrats, and specifically the corrupt Clinton machine.
[00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:40.651]  Now, I want to take you, you made this excellent point.
[00:41:40.671 --> 00:41:43.833]  So, WikiLeaks, they went after WikiLeaks.
[00:41:43.893 --> 00:41:48.476]  We have this Iceland Minister of Interior, this government official, and he said, look,
[00:41:49.777 --> 00:41:50.237]  The U.S.
[00:41:50.257 --> 00:41:53.599]  government, under Obama, sent a trove of FBI agents.
[00:41:53.619 --> 00:41:56.160]  They were going to frame Assange, frame WikiLeaks.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:03.043]  He asked them to get out of his country, and we were doing it under the guise that their systems were hacked, and we were there to help them.
[00:42:03.303 --> 00:42:08.045]  And this Interior Minister, he was questioning it, and he said, look, this is highly suspicious.
[00:42:08.085 --> 00:42:12.046]  It turns out, according to him, they were going to just try to frame Assange.
[00:42:12.206 --> 00:42:14.027]  And what did Assange do, folks?
[00:42:14.107 --> 00:42:15.528]  And I know we're running out of time.
[00:42:16.408 --> 00:42:17.549]  Expose the truth.
[00:42:17.749 --> 00:42:18.870]  That's all we're talking about here.
[00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:20.912]  And he's not a Russian agent, by the way.
[00:42:21.012 --> 00:42:22.893]  I mean, I don't know if people realize he's Swedish.
[00:42:23.113 --> 00:42:24.955]  He just likes the truth, apparently.
[00:42:24.975 --> 00:42:26.516]  And it's cost him everything.
[00:42:26.536 --> 00:42:31.160]  And the fact that we tried to frame him and set him up, I mean, does that speak to our legitimacy?
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:42.589]  Does that speak to the fact that the CIA, the same CIA, said, look, Saddam Hussein, and I'm sorry, we've beaten this like a dead horse, but I've got to say it again, Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which is why we invaded Iraq.
[00:42:42.869 --> 00:42:44.830]  We know that that was an utter lie.
[00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:45.391]  And the fact that
[00:42:46.071 --> 00:42:47.452]  Why should we trust them now?
[00:42:48.152 --> 00:42:50.094]  And are they trying to start war with Russia?
[00:42:50.134 --> 00:42:53.055]  I mean, is that the game that they're playing here?
[00:42:53.135 --> 00:42:59.699]  And now you've got, again, Mitch McConnell making a very stern statement today, demonizing Russia.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:04.202]  So, but like you said, they won't deny anything in the emails is real.
[00:43:04.682 --> 00:43:06.564]  They won't try to defend.
[00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:07.584]  How about that?
[00:43:07.744 --> 00:43:10.766]  How about a little defense about what was exposed in the email?
[00:43:10.846 --> 00:43:13.788]  Instead, they just want to attack Russia, attack Russia, attack Russia.
[00:43:14.088 --> 00:43:14.648]  We're good to go.
[00:43:32.538 --> 00:43:34.119]  Now he's on the war against Trump.
[00:43:34.639 --> 00:43:38.922]  Quote, we're five weeks from inauguration and the president-elect is completely unhinged.
[00:43:39.262 --> 00:43:41.824]  The electoral college must do what it was designed for.
[00:43:42.184 --> 00:43:45.026]  Now he makes this comment because of a tweet that Trump sent out.
[00:43:45.306 --> 00:43:45.547]  Unhinged.
[00:43:45.567 --> 00:43:45.927]  Unhinged.
[00:43:46.107 --> 00:43:47.168]  Trump is unhinged.
[00:43:47.208 --> 00:43:48.989]  Because he calls out corrupt media.
[00:43:49.509 --> 00:43:51.030]  So Trump calls out corrupt media.
[00:43:51.151 --> 00:43:53.452]  That's apparently unhinged.
[00:43:53.712 --> 00:43:59.457]  But what's not unhinged is calling for the Electoral College to go against the will of the people, Jim Himes.
[00:43:59.617 --> 00:44:00.838]  Apparently that's not unhinged.
[00:44:01.118 --> 00:44:03.220]  No, that is what is unhinged.
[00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:04.121]  But here's the thing.
[00:44:04.989 --> 00:44:16.764]  He's saying that the reason the Electoral College was originally purposed was to keep people who are not qualified for being president or, you know, unhinged from being president.
[00:44:16.824 --> 00:44:16.985]  No.
[00:44:17.345 --> 00:44:23.133]  The reason why we have the Electoral College is very easily illustrated right here in Trump's America.
[00:44:23.673 --> 00:44:30.639]  This is a map of the counties that Donald Trump won compared to the counties that Hillary Clinton won.
[00:44:30.719 --> 00:44:37.144]  As you can see, 80%, if not more, of the United States landmass was for Donald Trump.
[00:44:37.484 --> 00:44:40.186]  That's why we have the Electoral College, Mr. Himes.
[00:44:40.527 --> 00:44:42.008]  You are the one that is unhinged.
[00:44:42.248 --> 00:44:49.617]  Seriously, not only is he unhinged, but it looks like some electors within the college are also unhinged because they filed this lawsuit.
[00:44:49.637 --> 00:44:54.062]  They're in the process of trying to sue, and this would affect 29 states.
[00:44:54.222 --> 00:44:58.487]  And what they're trying to do here, they're trying to say the popular vote shouldn't determine the electorate.
[00:44:58.507 --> 00:44:59.929]  They're trying to break it apart.
[00:45:00.289 --> 00:45:01.730]  They're going rogue, Owen.
[00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:02.870]  It's really frightening.
[00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:04.131]  It's frightening at this point.
[00:45:04.471 --> 00:45:05.591]  And I'll tell you why it's frightening.
[00:45:05.651 --> 00:45:11.074]  Michael Moore made a very disturbing insinuation on a comedic show.
[00:45:11.094 --> 00:45:12.854]  I don't think it's any laughing matter.
[00:45:12.915 --> 00:45:14.995]  He said, look, anything could happen.
[00:45:15.055 --> 00:45:17.777]  You know, it's six, we're six weeks out, five weeks out.
[00:45:17.917 --> 00:45:20.778]  And he was insinuating that Trump could be assassinated.
[00:45:21.198 --> 00:45:21.999]  That's what he was talking about.
[00:45:22.059 --> 00:45:23.540]  And who knows what he was insinuating.
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:27.122]  But of course that's in the cards, I think, of what he was insinuating.
[00:45:27.222 --> 00:45:32.526]  And to make a laughing matter out of it is, like you said, it's really quite disturbing.
[00:45:32.846 --> 00:45:33.567]  And he was right.
[00:45:33.627 --> 00:45:35.308]  I mean, he did predict that Trump would win.
[00:45:35.968 --> 00:45:42.173]  He tried to pull that whole thing where he lured Trump voters in to listen to his documentary and then essentially bashed him.
[00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:44.775]  But isn't this just doing exactly what they always do?
[00:45:44.855 --> 00:45:47.556]  Taking the reality and then flipping it on their head.
[00:45:47.597 --> 00:45:48.157]  What are they doing?
[00:45:48.217 --> 00:45:49.578]  They're the ones that are going rogue.
[00:45:49.738 --> 00:45:49.958]  They are.
[00:45:49.978 --> 00:45:52.420]  They're the ones that are interrupting our democratic process.
[00:45:52.821 --> 00:45:55.843]  They are the ones that are, I mean, but then they say that that's Trump.
[00:45:55.883 --> 00:45:57.284]  They say that that's the Russians.
[00:45:57.424 --> 00:46:09.254]  No, we know exactly what's going on and it'll be interesting to me to see what happens with Mitch McConnell and his wife considering their stances that are kind of against the grain for what Trump is saying.
[00:46:09.394 --> 00:46:09.914]  It's very strange.
[00:46:09.934 --> 00:46:10.534]  It's very strange.
[00:46:38.123 --> 00:46:39.824]  Is this the fake news from New York Times?
[00:46:39.864 --> 00:46:40.384]  Pretty much.
[00:46:41.285 --> 00:46:44.947]  The same rag that wants to defend pedophilia.
[00:46:45.208 --> 00:46:45.748]  We're out of time.
[00:46:45.828 --> 00:46:46.188]  Goodness.
[00:46:47.149 --> 00:46:48.490]  Check this article out, guys.
[00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:49.390]  Actually, this story.
[00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:51.692]  It's going to be in the Nightly News tonight with David Knight.
[00:46:51.732 --> 00:46:52.552]  Be sure and tune in.
[00:46:52.572 --> 00:46:53.953]  It'll be up on YouTube later.
[00:46:53.973 --> 00:46:56.435]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting with Owen Schroyer.
[00:47:03.024 --> 00:47:11.171]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:20.958]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.379 --> 00:47:25.222]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.302 --> 00:47:28.304]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.324 --> 00:47:29.825]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.
[00:47:53.493 --> 00:47:54.533]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.

[00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:02.293]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:05.031 --> 00:49:16.235]  His Lordship, the star of Return of the Jedi, Jabba, Michael Moore, Huttus, Hippocritus Maximus, says something crazy could happen to stop Trump becoming president.
[00:49:16.555 --> 00:49:21.657]  It's the same guy that predicted he would actually win because he knew the bulls were fake and he knew the inside baseball.
[00:49:21.677 --> 00:49:24.378]  You know, I made that prediction in the summer.
[00:49:24.398 --> 00:49:24.778]  Yeah, you did.
[00:49:24.798 --> 00:49:25.258]  You called it.
[00:49:26.378 --> 00:49:28.119]  So I'd like to make another one tonight.
[00:49:28.139 --> 00:49:28.239]  Great.
[00:49:28.259 --> 00:49:28.859]  We're very excited.
[00:49:29.299 --> 00:49:31.180]  And get your moan on, audience.
[00:49:37.838 --> 00:49:39.839]  He's not president of the United States yet.
[00:49:40.259 --> 00:49:42.401]  Yeah.
[00:49:44.442 --> 00:49:48.726]  He's not president till noon on January 20th of 2017.
[00:49:49.966 --> 00:49:53.409]  That is, that is, what are we, this is a Wednesday night?
[00:49:53.629 --> 00:49:53.849]  Yeah.
[00:49:54.149 --> 00:49:55.991]  So that's more than six weeks away.
[00:49:56.311 --> 00:50:01.295]  Would you not agree, regardless what side of the political fence you're on, this has been the craziest election year.
[00:50:02.115 --> 00:50:04.056]  Nothing anyone has predicted has happened.
[00:50:04.217 --> 00:50:05.037]  Yeah.
[00:50:05.317 --> 00:50:06.578]  The opposite has happened.
[00:50:06.678 --> 00:50:06.918]  Yes.
[00:50:07.258 --> 00:50:12.442]  So is it possible, just possible, that in these next six weeks something else might happen?
[00:50:12.662 --> 00:50:12.882]  Yeah.
[00:50:13.042 --> 00:50:13.822]  Something crazy.
[00:50:14.143 --> 00:50:15.423]  Something we're not expecting.
[00:50:15.684 --> 00:50:21.167]  Okay, so he says that no one predicted things accurately.
[00:50:21.207 --> 00:50:22.948]  No, I predicted them exactly accurately.
[00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:26.070]  And so did Ann Coulter.
[00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:30.633]  And which Republican candidate has the best chance of winning the general election?
[00:50:31.673 --> 00:50:34.275]  Of the declared ones right now, Donald Trump.
[00:50:39.578 --> 00:50:41.480]  See, that's why you call us the fake news.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.482]  Because we're way more accurate than you.
[00:50:44.542 --> 00:50:47.383]  Because we're not beholden to anybody except our audience.
[00:50:47.424 --> 00:50:48.204]  And they want the truth.
[00:50:48.504 --> 00:50:49.205]  We want the truth.
[00:50:49.505 --> 00:50:50.185]  We want freedom.
[00:50:50.305 --> 00:50:51.226]  We want low taxes.
[00:50:51.726 --> 00:50:53.688]  We want to be able to live our lives as we see fit.
[00:50:54.808 --> 00:50:56.550]  Practice our religion, not practice it.
[00:50:57.441 --> 00:50:58.361]  We're Americans.
[00:50:58.502 --> 00:50:59.762]  Stop calling us racist.
[00:51:00.362 --> 00:51:01.943]  Stop trying to create a racial divide.
[00:51:03.224 --> 00:51:10.327]  But we've seen the New York Times, the LA Times, so many publications, I can't remember them all, saying, man, somebody needs to kill Trump.
[00:51:11.207 --> 00:51:12.468]  Somebody needs to put a bullet in him.
[00:51:12.548 --> 00:51:17.150]  There have been Hollywood producers that go out and say, I will pay for someone to kill him.
[00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:18.210]  I'm serious.
[00:51:18.731 --> 00:51:20.511]  Here's my Facebook address.
[00:51:20.551 --> 00:51:21.592]  I'm ready to finance it.
[00:51:22.092 --> 00:51:25.474]  Take a look at what these twits just tweeted on Twitter.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:30.441]  This black woman says, so no one's gonna kill Donald Trump?
[00:51:31.321 --> 00:51:33.822]  I wish somebody would kill Donald Trump already.
[00:51:34.062 --> 00:51:35.743]  He talks so much, bleep!
[00:51:36.543 --> 00:51:39.004]  Man, I kill Trump and do the time.
[00:51:39.144 --> 00:51:40.104]  I'm cool with it.
[00:51:40.524 --> 00:51:44.605]  If someone else doesn't kill Donald Trump, I will, says this black woman.
[00:51:44.986 --> 00:51:49.007]  This Mexican says, can someone kill Donald Trump, please?
[00:51:49.767 --> 00:51:52.189]  This guy says that he'll just do it himself.
[00:51:52.609 --> 00:51:55.511]  This black woman wants Donald Trump killed tomorrow.
[00:51:55.971 --> 00:51:59.454]  This black woman's trying to incite some thug to kill Trump.
[00:51:59.954 --> 00:52:02.836]  This Mexican woman is upset that no one's done it yet.
[00:52:03.336 --> 00:52:05.097]  So no one's gonna kill Trump?
[00:52:05.478 --> 00:52:08.039]  We're just gonna let him live, she says?
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:13.041]  This black woman tweets, dude, who's gonna kill Trump, man?
[00:52:13.781 --> 00:52:15.262]  They just go on and on.
[00:52:15.382 --> 00:52:20.643]  This guy says that he's saving up to buy an AR-15 and he's gonna do it himself.
[00:52:21.163 --> 00:52:28.265]  That's just a small sample of the tweets that were posted within the last few minutes alone on Twitter.
[00:52:29.006 --> 00:52:32.547]  As the Black Live Matter mobs are hungry for more violence.
[00:52:32.827 --> 00:52:37.088]  Apparently since they haven't been able to blow off some steam by rioting this week,
[00:52:37.748 --> 00:52:41.591]  Because that's what I was thinking of doing too.
[00:52:41.771 --> 00:52:43.532]  Killing Donald Trump.
[00:52:43.972 --> 00:52:48.335]  Because Donald Trump don't need to become president.
[00:52:48.756 --> 00:52:50.096]  I'm going to have a f***ing gun.
[00:52:50.657 --> 00:52:51.838]  I'm going to kill your ass.
[00:52:51.858 --> 00:52:53.359]  I'm going to kill you.
[00:52:53.879 --> 00:52:54.660]  I'm going to kill your ass.
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:56.100]  Unit!
[00:52:56.461 --> 00:52:57.922]  I want your life from Amazon!
[00:52:58.302 --> 00:52:59.623]  I will circumcise you!
[00:53:00.443 --> 00:53:01.584]  I will circumcise you!
[00:53:02.145 --> 00:53:04.106]  You are nothing but a bastard!
[00:53:04.813 --> 00:53:05.933]  I gotta be careful even saying that.
[00:53:05.953 --> 00:53:07.914]  The mainstream media is so deceptive now, folks.
[00:53:08.254 --> 00:53:11.375]  They might even take what I just said and play it and say I said it.
[00:53:11.735 --> 00:53:13.496]  That's the level of deception.
[00:53:13.876 --> 00:53:20.558]  And then they're gonna wonder if something happens to Trump or Trump supporters who are being killed and beaten and burned out of their houses all over the country.
[00:53:20.578 --> 00:53:28.240]  And then they sit there and go, Alex Jones said a pizzeria had a torture dungeon under it and they were killing kids at Comet Ping Pong.
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:31.721]  I never said any such thing and my reporters didn't.
[00:53:31.981 --> 00:53:33.722]  But see, that's how they straw man.
[00:53:34.542 --> 00:53:36.463]  To divert off all the other Podesta emails.
[00:53:36.743 --> 00:53:38.765]  And it's why people don't believe you.
[00:53:39.465 --> 00:53:43.688]  Not even the brightest bulbs believe you anymore.
[00:53:43.748 --> 00:53:52.874]  You had a 6% trust rate in a big national study by AP, of their own readers, that said, we don't trust you.
[00:53:54.214 --> 00:53:52.874]  6%.
[00:53:54.855 --> 00:53:56.116]  That was before the election.
[00:54:02.403 --> 00:54:05.968]  Yesterday we had an anniversary that not too many people want to talk about.
[00:54:06.529 --> 00:54:17.645]  It marks the 10th anniversary of Mexico's literal war on drugs where they started using troops to shoot it out in the streets of people and of course the violence that we've seen in Mexico.
[00:54:18.226 --> 00:54:23.412]  Based on the war on drugs is far exceeds what we've seen even here in the United States.
[00:54:23.993 --> 00:54:28.639]  Now it's been 10 years since Mexican troops were unleashed against drug cartels.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.584]  The report from the AFP that it'll mark the anniversary it was yesterday.
[00:54:33.244 --> 00:54:35.647]  They say still though murders are rising yet again.
[00:54:36.408 --> 00:54:41.352]  And the military does not want to be a part of it, says that they're eager to return to their barracks.
[00:54:41.793 --> 00:54:48.258]  Now, what has happened over the last 10 years with the war on drugs in Mexico, trying to stop it by force?
[00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:52.001]  They point out that this started under Felipe Calderon.
[00:54:52.042 --> 00:54:57.386]  They said his six-year term was marked by a surge in murders, rising from 10,253 in 2007 to a peak of 22,852 in 2011.
[00:55:04.352 --> 00:55:04.972]  Think about that.
[00:55:05.433 --> 00:55:07.354]  That's 20,000 a year.
[00:55:08.334 --> 00:55:09.735]  And it's come back up again.
[00:55:09.775 --> 00:55:18.880]  They say, although the murders remain well under the worst years of Calderon's president, there are now 17,063 homicides in the first 10 months of 2016.
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:22.342]  Already surpassing last year's 12-month total of just over 17,000.
[00:55:22.402 --> 00:55:25.504]  So, put this in perspective, okay?
[00:55:26.431 --> 00:55:31.592]  For five years we've had in Syria this war that was created by the U.S.
[00:55:31.612 --> 00:55:34.553]  government as well, and there there's been about 400,000 people killed.
[00:55:34.573 --> 00:55:38.954]  So that's about 80,000 people per year on average, but 20,000 people a year in Mexico over a 10-year period.
[00:55:38.994 --> 00:55:39.755]  That's about 200,000 people.
[00:55:45.598 --> 00:55:48.921]  This is a major war, and it's not getting any better.
[00:55:49.381 --> 00:55:51.283]  It's not doing anything to stop the flow of drugs.
[00:55:51.323 --> 00:56:00.471]  As a matter of fact, they point out the weakening of the drug cartels has led to the emergence of smaller gangs that seek to diversify their business through kidnapping and extortion.
[00:56:00.991 --> 00:56:05.155]  Now those are not counted as drugs, because now they've diversified.
[00:56:05.455 --> 00:56:10.539]  But you create these cartels just like you create the corrupt government agency.
[00:56:10.559 --> 00:56:13.802]  You corrupt the court system, you corrupt the police system, you involve the military,
[00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:15.991]  And it continues to go on.
[00:56:16.031 --> 00:56:17.751]  They say the war has become much more complex.
[00:56:18.071 --> 00:56:19.732]  The level of death has escalated.
[00:56:19.752 --> 00:56:22.353]  This is a security expert at the University of Mexico.
[00:56:22.573 --> 00:56:29.476]  They say the drug cartels have terrorized the population by leaving decapitated bodies of their rivals on roadsides or hanging them on bridges.
[00:56:29.776 --> 00:56:31.056]  Do we want that in America?
[00:56:31.576 --> 00:56:32.677]  See, that's part
[00:56:33.317 --> 00:56:34.798]  Of why we want to control our borders.
[00:56:35.179 --> 00:56:41.164]  But understand the role of the war on drugs in bringing this violence and the drug cartels into our country.
[00:56:41.224 --> 00:56:42.645]  That is the real origin of it.
[00:56:42.905 --> 00:56:44.907]  They said the police have been accused of colluding with criminals.
[00:56:44.927 --> 00:56:46.428]  That always happens with prohibition.
[00:56:46.849 --> 00:56:57.037]  While soldiers and Marines have faced allegations of committing torture, extrajudicial killings, sexual abuse, even the defense minister agrees that troops do not belong in a law enforcement role.
[00:56:57.057 --> 00:56:57.638]  Of course they don't.
[00:56:58.058 --> 00:57:04.362]  He said, we didn't ask to be here, we don't like it, we didn't study how to chase criminals, and yet it gets worse and worse.
[00:57:05.083 --> 00:57:08.085]  So we have to understand, it's been 45 years for the United States.
[00:57:08.805 --> 00:57:11.908]  We haven't gotten to this level yet, but it will.
[00:57:12.488 --> 00:57:13.809]  It has continued to escalate.
[00:57:13.969 --> 00:57:20.534]  Do you realize that when Rudy Giuliani became mayor of New York, there was about 200 total marijuana arrests that year?
[00:57:21.479 --> 00:57:22.620]  Think about how that has changed.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:25.202]  Think about how we have targeted the individuals in our country.
[00:57:25.242 --> 00:57:29.404]  And then I want to show you a little bit of rationality out of Israel.
[00:57:29.865 --> 00:57:34.228]  The report is that Israel is already in talks to export marijuana.
[00:57:34.708 --> 00:57:38.931]  So the Holy Land may be exporting medical marijuana.
[00:57:39.371 --> 00:57:41.353]  Maybe they could call it Holy Smokes.
[00:57:42.353 --> 00:57:42.874]  We're good.
[00:57:57.110 --> 00:57:57.490]  We're good to go.
[00:58:13.007 --> 00:58:19.635]  They first isolated THC and then they discovered the body's endocannabinoid system as a bonus.
[00:58:19.655 --> 00:58:26.002]  You see, your body was set up to use some of the chemicals that are in marijuana as a natural plant.
[00:58:26.663 --> 00:58:33.511]  It is not a class one drug as the United Nations created that schedule so that it has absolutely no medical use.
[00:58:33.991 --> 00:58:55.115]  The war on drugs is a creation of the United Nations, and we need to understand that, we need to get ahead of that, and we need to take back this rational foreign policy, and do something along the lines of what Israel did, and say, hey, we're going to have compassion for people who could use this to treat their illnesses, because there's many illnesses that are not treated very well, except through marijuana.
[00:58:55.135 --> 00:58:56.595]  Well, that's it for tonight's news.
