[00:00:20.216 --> 00:00:21.777]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.997 --> 00:00:22.678]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:22.778 --> 00:00:23.639]  It's Wednesday, October 26, 2016.
[00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.741]  Here are top stories.
[00:00:30.024 --> 00:00:36.309]  Tonight, the Obama administration sinks to an all-time low and U.S.
[00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:47.078]  military veterans are not happy as the federal government decides to take back reenlistment bonuses from veterans after they return from war.
[00:00:48.393 --> 00:00:56.157]  Then, while big corporations consolidate the mainstream media, there is also another merger going on behind the scenes.
[00:00:56.537 --> 00:01:01.839]  This time, the establishment wants control of the nation's electronic voting machines.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.603]  And you guessed it, Clinton donors and George Soros have their greedy little paws all over this one.
[00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:13.905]  Plus, Alex Jones talks to Bill Clinton's son about Google censoring his videos.
[00:01:16.948 --> 00:01:22.797]  That's coming up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.385 --> 00:01:33.027]  Look, I'm not going to sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[00:01:33.287 --> 00:01:36.309]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.430]  Because it's already here.
[00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.470]  It's being announced.
[00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:42.293]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[00:01:42.773 --> 00:01:44.054]  You don't let them break your will.
[00:01:44.695 --> 00:01:56.763]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app and download an app that took us over a year to develop that we're going to be expanding on the next few months with free video and audio and podcast feeds and breaking news and alerts and so much more.
[00:01:57.023 --> 00:01:59.965]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[00:02:00.505 --> 00:02:04.807]  Take action!
[00:02:04.827 --> 00:02:06.707]  I train two, three times a day.
[00:02:07.508 --> 00:02:11.809]  They're brutal, agonizing, painful training sessions.
[00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:18.172]  I have to have the edge over my opponents.
[00:02:19.012 --> 00:02:24.094]  I believe that Influoresce products, Super Male Vitality, you know, that gives me the edge.
[00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:27.056]  Well, you have to know where you break.
[00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:30.740]  You know, ultimately, like, you don't push yourself to know where that breaking point is.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.422]  You're always going to be falling short of what your potential is.
[00:02:33.923 --> 00:02:39.609]  So it's really just about finding how far you can go.
[00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:57.894]  There's a lot of different things out there.
[00:02:58.994 --> 00:02:59.915]  I only use the best.
[00:03:00.255 --> 00:03:06.278]  Well, the name of the game is Monopoly.
[00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:07.978]  That's how the big boys play it.
[00:03:08.018 --> 00:03:10.780]  First it was the banks, consolidating down to about a half dozen banks.
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.062]  And understand, that lies squarely at the foot of Bill Clinton and his administration.
[00:03:16.082 --> 00:03:23.506]  It was his chief of staff at the White House, Erskine Bowles, out of North Carolina, that pushed through the merger of North Carolina's large bank, Nations Bank,
[00:03:23.986 --> 00:03:31.252]  And Bank of America, moving Bank of America's headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina, where it became Brink of America, that's the name it had.
[00:03:31.272 --> 00:03:37.318]  But that set off a wave of mergers that resulted in a half dozen banks that were too big to fail, too big to jail.
[00:03:38.123 --> 00:03:40.944]  Now we see the same thing happening with the media companies.
[00:03:41.084 --> 00:03:43.045]  AT&T and Time Warner announced their merger.
[00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:49.407]  If that happens, it's going to set off another wave of mergers, and there are already only about a half dozen media companies.
[00:03:50.027 --> 00:03:57.650]  The repercussions of this are incredible if we look at free speech, but that's not the only thing that's being consolidated.
[00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.611]  We now have the voting machine companies being consolidated.
[00:04:01.611 --> 00:04:06.134]  One company has about 50% of the voting machines nationwide.
[00:04:06.614 --> 00:04:07.815]  That is Dominion Voting.
[00:04:08.595 --> 00:04:21.863]  And Dominion Voting and another large company, there's only about three large companies in the United States, another large one, HIG Capital, which runs Hart InterCivic Machines, are on the list of big money donors to guess who?
[00:04:22.583 --> 00:04:23.784]  The Clinton Foundation.
[00:04:24.384 --> 00:04:28.347]  As we consolidate into a couple of different companies, or maybe just one.
[00:04:28.627 --> 00:04:29.447]  You know, soon there will be one.
[00:04:29.467 --> 00:04:31.489]  It's just like Highlander, there can only be one.
[00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:32.029]  Okay?
[00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:39.754]  And there's going to be one person sitting at the center of this web of corruption, and that is Hillary Clinton.
[00:04:40.094 --> 00:04:41.275]  That's the way this is going to go down.
[00:04:41.815 --> 00:05:02.966]  Now, we see from recent releases of Guccifer 2.0, the DNC hacks and other things, we have seen this list of donors and we can now see that Dominion voting machines used in 600 jurisdictions in 22 states in the United States and about 80,000 Dominion image cast precinct optical scan tabulators, okay, being used.
[00:05:02.986 --> 00:05:04.587]  That was even going back to 2010.
[00:05:04.867 --> 00:05:06.488]  It's more than that now.
[00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:09.490]  But that was the kind of market penetration these people had.
[00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.611]  These people are now big donors to the Clinton Foundation, we understand.
[00:05:13.811 --> 00:05:19.652]  And understand also that this Canadian corporation is also connected to Sequoia Voting Systems.
[00:05:19.692 --> 00:05:23.293]  Sequoia Voting Systems is also connected to Smartmatic.
[00:05:23.913 --> 00:05:26.233]  Smartmatic is connected to Soros.
[00:05:26.453 --> 00:05:29.154]  The knee bone's connected to the hip bone, whatever, okay?
[00:05:29.174 --> 00:05:30.174]  This is the way this works.
[00:05:30.574 --> 00:05:34.935]  It is like a skeleton web of cronyism.
[00:05:35.675 --> 00:05:44.363]  And understand that Smartmatic, as I pointed out before, was created by friends of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela to control those elections there.
[00:05:44.403 --> 00:05:45.324]  They did such a good job.
[00:05:45.704 --> 00:05:50.188]  They used them to rig elections throughout Central and South America and the Philippines and other places.
[00:05:50.489 --> 00:05:51.730]  Then we have the GOP.
[00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.574]  In Utah, bringing them in to run the GOP primary this year, paying them $80,000.
[00:05:57.834 --> 00:06:03.798]  You have to understand, this is a bipartisan scam to run these elections.
[00:06:04.258 --> 00:06:06.459]  That's why they're putting in electronic voting machines.
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.903]  They want to tell us that it was a response to the problems that occurred in 2000 with the Gore-Bush election.
[00:06:12.833 --> 00:06:21.556]  Yet what these machines do is give them the perfect way to erase any means of auditing the election, completely removing the paper trail.
[00:06:21.616 --> 00:06:24.117]  And that's what we see here in Texas.
[00:06:24.777 --> 00:06:32.680]  Yes, Monday we went down to talk to the Director of Elections in Texas because of many ways in which he has shut down the paper trail.
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:39.322]  And of course, in August, he tried to set in a new wave of regulations to remove even more auditing capability.
[00:06:39.722 --> 00:06:40.122]  We're good to go.
[00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.450]  And so the question is, why would he shut these things down?
[00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:03.593]  Why would he shut them down for the expediency of his workers or so that he could use a particular vendor?
[00:07:03.993 --> 00:07:09.756]  There is a long article that has the questions that I would have asked him if he would have talked to us on Monday.
[00:07:10.156 --> 00:07:13.758]  An article, Lovers of Power, flushing the vote down the memory hole.
[00:07:13.798 --> 00:07:23.023]  And you can see in this article the many different ways that our Director of Elections here, Keith Ingram, has tried to shut down the audit trail.
[00:07:23.263 --> 00:07:27.087]  These are the same tactics that are being used nationwide, folks.
[00:07:27.467 --> 00:07:28.869]  Again, going back to what we began with.
[00:07:29.847 --> 00:07:33.809]  These voting machines are being provided by only two or three companies.
[00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.492]  50%, more than 50% by one company.
[00:07:38.072 --> 00:07:42.855]  They're going to use the same tactics to control the election to shut down the auditing process.
[00:07:42.875 --> 00:07:50.019]  And we can see that based on lawsuits that are going on here in Texas, going back to recent elections.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:57.424]  Now, some of the issues that we put in here, the fact that he shut down and waived laws requiring a partial manual recount, shut that down.
[00:07:58.004 --> 00:08:01.906]  He waived laws requiring the printing of paper backup results tapes.
[00:08:02.327 --> 00:08:06.789]  He ignored laws requiring printing of legally sufficient ballot images for recounts.
[00:08:07.169 --> 00:08:14.494]  And he has ignored the laws that allow poll monitors to look at what is happening in the election precincts.
[00:08:15.234 --> 00:08:19.657]  Not only that, this particular individual, again as we said, this is a bipartisan issue.
[00:08:20.617 --> 00:08:21.638]  It's not just Democrats.
[00:08:21.978 --> 00:08:23.119]  It is Republicans as well.
[00:08:23.739 --> 00:08:24.960]  And this particular individual
[00:08:26.227 --> 00:08:29.311]  Had a private practice, was in private practice here in Austin.
[00:08:29.612 --> 00:08:38.944]  Took massive pay cuts to go to Arkansas to join a law firm there that was run by someone who used to be partners with Hillary Clinton at the Rose Law Firm.
[00:08:38.964 --> 00:08:42.408]  He was partners with Hillary Clinton, with Vince Foster, with Webster Hubble.
[00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.471]  And he was the managing director there.
[00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:47.572]  So this guy took a massive pay cut to go there.
[00:08:47.893 --> 00:08:53.837]  He then came back to Texas, not making much more money, eventually became the director of elections.
[00:08:53.877 --> 00:08:58.621]  He still is only at 40% of what he had in private practice.
[00:08:58.641 --> 00:08:59.501]  And so the question is,
[00:09:00.472 --> 00:09:01.873]  What's behind those career moves?
[00:09:02.393 --> 00:09:05.854]  What's behind the connections to the friends of the Clintons?
[00:09:05.894 --> 00:09:17.719]  And of course, the guy that he worked for, that was a partner with Hillary Clinton at the Rose Law Firm, is a big contributor again to the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton campaign, just like these voting machine companies.
[00:09:18.459 --> 00:09:20.880]  It all comes back to the same thing.
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.861]  Story after story after story.
[00:09:23.717 --> 00:09:28.939]  The issue really is, why can't we get rid of these electronic voting machines?
[00:09:29.439 --> 00:09:37.302]  As we saw with a story from Don Salazar today, Texas County here, as we saw problems with electronic voting machines, what did they do?
[00:09:37.382 --> 00:09:42.644]  They went to the emergency backup procedure, and that is to go back to paper ballots.
[00:09:43.564 --> 00:09:49.706]  On Monday we had this report from Paul Joseph Watson that we saw votes being switched from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton.
[00:09:49.726 --> 00:09:54.847]  People would vote a straight Republican ticket and it would do that except for the presidential race.
[00:09:55.047 --> 00:09:57.267]  The presidential race would give them Hillary Clinton.
[00:09:58.128 --> 00:10:07.090]  And so presumably this was happening in another county in Texas and what they did was they put in paper ballots as emergency procedure.
[00:10:08.004 --> 00:10:09.544]  Folks, it is an emergency.
[00:10:09.944 --> 00:10:11.245]  We need to put in paper ballots.
[00:10:11.305 --> 00:10:16.566]  We need to request paper ballots when you go to vote so there is some kind of an audit trail.
[00:10:16.686 --> 00:10:22.547]  And one of the things that needs to be done, whether Donald Trump wins this or not, we have to reform the election process.
[00:10:22.847 --> 00:10:25.428]  We have to get rid of the electronic voting machines.
[00:10:25.748 --> 00:10:30.489]  Whenever anything goes wrong, just as we see with a story from Don Salazar, they switch back to paper ballots.
[00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:33.830]  When you have to contest an election, you have to audit an election, what do you do?
[00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:45.552]  You try to go back to the paper records, if they can be reproduced out of the voting machines, if you don't have a director of elections like we do here in Texas that does everything he can to shut down those auditing records.
[00:10:46.232 --> 00:10:48.253]  Why don't we just start with paper ballots in the first place?
[00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:58.695]  That's what they did in the UK, that's why they were able to defeat the mainstream media and the polls, the opinion pollsters who were telling them the day of the election
[00:10:59.255 --> 00:10:59.735]  That's right.
[00:11:14.608 --> 00:11:15.128]  Donation.
[00:11:15.408 --> 00:11:34.634]  Project Veritas released a fourth video in the latest series uncovering corruption connected to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, and they say, in the efforts to prove the credibility of the undercover donor featured in the videos, and to keep the investigation going, Project Veritas Action made the decision to donate $20,000 to Robert Creamer's effort.
[00:11:35.074 --> 00:11:42.817]  Soon after the transfer was made, the donor's niece, another Project Veritas Action journalist actually, was offered an internship with Creamer.
[00:11:43.417 --> 00:11:48.800]  The more money that was promised to Kramer, the more access Project Veritas journalists seem to get it, continues.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.661]  Okay, this is what we see continually.
[00:11:50.901 --> 00:11:52.622]  A pay-to-play procedure.
[00:11:53.602 --> 00:11:55.063]  This is the corruption that is happening.
[00:11:55.503 --> 00:11:57.684]  Now I said at the beginning, we're talking about monopolies.
[00:11:57.764 --> 00:12:05.328]  The monopoly banks, the monopoly voting machine companies, and then of course the monopoly media that is coming towards us.
[00:12:05.368 --> 00:12:11.011]  Donald Trump jumped on this merger with AT&T and Time Warner this weekend immediately.
[00:12:12.005 --> 00:12:16.007]  Pointing out how this will destroy America, how it will destroy democracy.
[00:12:16.627 --> 00:12:19.929]  Why would a corporate merger destroy democracy?
[00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:23.351]  Well, he's seen how the media has treated him.
[00:12:23.871 --> 00:12:28.954]  He's seen how the media is not interested in any stories of corruption about the Clintons.
[00:12:29.716 --> 00:12:38.699]  Nevertheless, they will treat with the utmost respect and veracity any rumors of things that happened to him as personal attacks.
[00:12:39.119 --> 00:12:49.063]  Even though you have somebody accusing him of inappropriate touching and saying that it happened at a concert that never occurred, the media still runs with it.
[00:12:49.083 --> 00:12:52.204]  Just as we saw yesterday with Megyn Kelly and Newt Gingrich.
[00:12:52.584 --> 00:12:54.285]  They don't want to talk about the issues.
[00:12:54.705 --> 00:12:57.306]  And so this is a real First Amendment issue.
[00:12:57.686 --> 00:13:16.430]  If we have only one or two companies that are going to control not only be the providers of the Internet, but they're also going to be providers of information content, pulling all of that together, that all is something that is going to be essentially creating a net that we cannot get through.
[00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:21.471]  It all ties together as well with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Transatlantic Partnerships.
[00:13:22.132 --> 00:13:23.512]  Those agreements
[00:13:24.292 --> 00:13:24.793]  We're good.
[00:13:39.284 --> 00:13:41.005]  We see YouTube doing all the time.
[00:13:41.045 --> 00:13:47.989]  When somebody has a copyright claim, what they do is they destroy the link, but they don't take the video down.
[00:13:48.049 --> 00:13:55.854]  Mega Upload did that, and they took down his multi-billion dollar company saying, you still have that video that we have the copyright claim on.
[00:13:56.494 --> 00:14:04.917]  That's the way they will take down anybody who tries to provide content or is a provider of original content.
[00:14:05.378 --> 00:14:08.419]  They want to be the channel through which everybody has to come.
[00:14:08.939 --> 00:14:10.340]  That is the dangerous thing about it.
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:18.763]  So whether you're an entertainer or whether you're a journalist, you will have to go through AT&T and Time Warner to get to your end market.
[00:14:19.243 --> 00:14:23.485]  They will take a big cut on it and they will also work with the government.
[00:14:24.178 --> 00:14:24.878]  Take a look at this.
[00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:28.761]  Big tech media mergers raise fresh privacy concerns.
[00:14:28.821 --> 00:14:29.781]  Of course they do.
[00:14:29.921 --> 00:14:38.307]  You didn't think that they were going to pass, they tried so many times to pass CISPA, SOPA, ACTA, PIPA.
[00:14:38.407 --> 00:14:44.931]  Finally they got CISA, the Cyber Intelligence Security Act or whatever they call it.
[00:14:45.811 --> 00:14:57.608]  It was nothing more than an effort to allow these people to turn over information that they collect about you to the government and not be sued by you for violating their privacy.
[00:14:58.028 --> 00:15:00.912]  What it does is it grants immunity to these corporations.
[00:15:01.573 --> 00:15:08.636]  We told you at the time that as soon as that was done, they were going to be stepping up the way in which they collect information from you.
[00:15:08.656 --> 00:15:11.378]  And of course, they've been collecting information and turning it over to the government.
[00:15:11.698 --> 00:15:18.281]  They're just concerned that they're going to have legal liability in the courts when people realize how they've been violating our privacy.
[00:15:18.641 --> 00:15:20.462]  So what they did was they gave them immunity.
[00:15:21.123 --> 00:15:29.747]  And they came back time and time and time again, here in America as well as Europe, with these various acts that would grant immunity to these corporations.
[00:15:30.467 --> 00:15:37.135]  So what is happening with this is that they're going to use copyright violations to shut down journalism.
[00:15:37.596 --> 00:15:42.522]  They're going to use their control of all the media to control even the entertainment that you see.
[00:15:42.542 --> 00:15:47.949]  They're going to watch everything that you watch, everything that you do, and they're going to report that to the government.
[00:15:48.029 --> 00:15:48.429]  Understand,
[00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:54.394]  That as we look at these NSA revelations that came out with Snowden, they kept saying it's simply metadata.
[00:15:54.414 --> 00:15:57.457]  We're not recording all your conversations and all your text messages.
[00:15:57.717 --> 00:16:06.144]  Well, whether or not that is true, the metadata is far more important to them than the actual phone conversations or text that you have.
[00:16:06.844 --> 00:16:07.145]  Thank you.
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:29.505]  Everything about you can be mapped into a geographical position even.
[00:16:29.545 --> 00:16:31.508]  That's what the geospatial intelligence is.
[00:16:31.548 --> 00:16:34.551]  It's the fastest growing branch of intelligence.
[00:16:34.871 --> 00:16:38.536]  That's why all of this is coming together in one issue.
[00:16:39.297 --> 00:16:43.321]  And the important thing is that Donald Trump smelled this skunk.
[00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:46.044]  And warned us about it at the very beginning.
[00:16:46.364 --> 00:16:50.707]  He's waking people up in ways that we've never seen a politician wake people up.
[00:16:50.747 --> 00:16:53.209]  He understands the tactics that they're using.
[00:16:53.429 --> 00:16:56.812]  He understands the strategy and the endgame that they're after.
[00:16:57.152 --> 00:17:06.018]  And this is why it is so important that we stop this globalism, this surveillance state, these tactics that they're doing, the monopoly tactics that they're using on people.
[00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.540]  We have to stop this now.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.302]  Now, of course, the other aspect about this is the open borders.
[00:17:11.842 --> 00:17:25.011]  And I think it's interesting today that we had immigration protesters, they call themselves an immigration rights group, shut down the George Washington Bridge, the upper level of George Washington Bridge, one of the major access areas into New York City.
[00:17:25.171 --> 00:17:25.952]  They shut it down.
[00:17:26.012 --> 00:17:28.794]  They had 90 minute traffic jams.
[00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:32.336]  They had bumper to bumper traffic that was barely inching along, they said.
[00:17:33.216 --> 00:17:36.999]  And I look at this and I say, well, are they going to give a pass to Chris Christie?
[00:17:37.697 --> 00:17:46.965]  They're trying to put him in jail with a felony because they say he was vindictive in terms of shutting down a bridge that allowed traffic to go back and forth from New York to New Jersey.
[00:17:46.985 --> 00:17:47.686]  Well, what about this?
[00:17:48.607 --> 00:17:55.432]  And why would these people think that they are entitled to come in to our country and shut down our transportation?
[00:17:55.452 --> 00:18:00.056]  Well, for the same reason that a Syrian refugee, this is a story on Infowars.com, a Syrian refugee
[00:18:00.757 --> 00:18:09.005]  Emigrates into the United Kingdom, gets 320,000 pounds, that's about a half a million dollars a year, for his four wives and 23 children.
[00:18:09.525 --> 00:18:10.806]  Four wives and 23 children.
[00:18:11.287 --> 00:18:16.512]  Now, we've been told by Hillary, we see the documents now, she told a Jewish group,
[00:18:17.052 --> 00:18:17.653]  We're good to go.
[00:18:32.449 --> 00:18:38.735]  We cannot afford to support all the people who want to just come here and live at our expense or shut down our transportation.
[00:18:39.015 --> 00:18:44.200]  So perhaps what they did was recruit a lot of voters for Donald Trump in New York today.
[00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:45.582]  Stay with us when we come back.
[00:18:45.662 --> 00:18:50.006]  Alex Jones talks to Danny Williams who had his YouTube channel banned forever today.
[00:18:50.026 --> 00:18:52.348]  30 million views of that press conference.
[00:18:52.368 --> 00:18:52.949]  They cut it off.
[00:18:52.989 --> 00:18:55.211]  It was the top search item for Bill Clinton.
[00:18:55.231 --> 00:18:55.892]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:06.803]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.

[00:22:47.475 --> 00:22:48.276]  We're good to go.
[00:23:02.591 --> 00:23:09.820]  With less than 12 days left before the most historic election in US history, we're seeing massive censorship being intensified.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:17.989]  Now, Danny Williams is reportedly Bill Clinton's illegitimate son from a black prostitute in Little Rock, Arkansas.
[00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:22.575]  And Bill Clinton has basically been caught giving him money and presents over the years.
[00:23:23.075 --> 00:23:27.378]  But I interviewed his aunt 20 years ago and have thought this story was extremely credible.
[00:23:27.758 --> 00:23:29.099]  The man's very handsome.
[00:23:29.139 --> 00:23:30.480]  He looks a lot like Bill Clinton.
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.822]  And regardless of what you say about Bill Clinton, when he was young, he was a handsome guy.
[00:23:34.343 --> 00:23:46.170]  But now that YouTube has shut down a video that had incredible millions and millions of views, and we now learn is shutting down other videos of Danny Williams across the web, it only adds credibility.
[00:23:46.631 --> 00:23:48.612]  Now I just hung up with him minutes ago.
[00:23:49.092 --> 00:23:50.113]  We taped it live.
[00:23:50.834 --> 00:23:51.434]  Here it is.
[00:23:51.754 --> 00:23:52.455]  This is what
[00:23:53.235 --> 00:23:57.837]  Hillary Clinton is scared of and does not want you to see, and that's the key.
[00:23:58.718 --> 00:23:59.938]  This adds a lot of credibility.
[00:24:00.479 --> 00:24:03.280]  They do not want you to see this.
[00:24:04.881 --> 00:24:09.363]  Ladies and gentlemen, 20 years ago, I interviewed Danny Williams' aunt.
[00:24:10.684 --> 00:24:15.086]  Bill Clinton, for years, sent $700 a month to their home, sent Christmas presents.
[00:24:15.686 --> 00:24:19.048]  Danny Williams is a spitting image of
[00:24:20.299 --> 00:24:20.759]  Bill Clinton.
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:25.082]  We had him on a few weeks ago, and it was big international news.
[00:24:25.182 --> 00:24:29.265]  Then, last week, hours before the debate, there was to be a big press conference.
[00:24:29.365 --> 00:24:30.586]  Hundreds of cameras were there.
[00:24:31.086 --> 00:24:35.029]  CNN came and threatened the hotel and said, this press conference isn't happening.
[00:24:35.489 --> 00:24:36.850]  They told Danny it was cancelled.
[00:24:37.471 --> 00:24:41.213]  Then we later learned that was a fraud, and about 15 members of the press covered it.
[00:24:41.894 --> 00:24:49.279]  There were more than 20 million views on Facebook and YouTube of the live conference that our reporters covered.
[00:24:50.575 --> 00:25:00.760]  Now, Danny Williams, we've learned today, had his YouTube channel with over 2 million views on his press conference, just on that channel, the number one video on YouTube, deleted.
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:12.885]  And in fact, in a moment, if Joe Biggs will come in for TV viewers, we can show folks a shot of this, where they've told him his account is suspended, and that's the end of it, for community violations.
[00:25:13.885 --> 00:25:18.108]  This is just where they have a bunch of Democratic tattletales say we don't like something and it's banned.
[00:25:18.188 --> 00:25:21.571]  So, whether you believe a story's true or not, I know it's true.
[00:25:21.591 --> 00:25:22.492]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[00:25:23.293 --> 00:25:26.715]  What's incredible is they're attempting to cover all of this up.
[00:25:26.735 --> 00:25:31.679]  So when the time comes, we'll do a document cam shot for TV viewers and get a shot of this in a moment.
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:38.264]  But Danny Williams, who I just caught on the phone, he's driving to go pick up his kids as he drives through Arkansas in the middle of nowhere.
[00:25:39.185 --> 00:25:44.747]  Yes, uh, basically today, uh, we found out earlier last night that they kicked out the YouTube channel saying that, you know, uh,
[00:25:58.522 --> 00:26:02.845]  It was a violation of the community or whatnot for the person who did it.
[00:26:03.325 --> 00:26:09.570]  But, technically, I got over so many viewers and a lot of good response.
[00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:13.032]  I don't feel like I did anything to violate anyone.
[00:26:13.152 --> 00:26:19.196]  But, yeah, they kicked it out and we're trying to, you know, figure that out right now.
[00:26:21.633 --> 00:26:26.877]  Well, they've done this to me whenever I expose, say, reports of Bill Clinton rape or whatever.
[00:26:26.897 --> 00:26:29.278]  They'll say community guidelines strike, where people complain.
[00:26:29.619 --> 00:26:32.140]  They say, yeah, we think this is mean, so they take it down.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.242]  I've had videos about World War III they take down.
[00:26:34.762 --> 00:26:38.044]  But, I mean, here you are, very polite in the press conference video they took down.
[00:26:39.065 --> 00:26:41.286]  There's a copy of it on Infowars.com as well.
[00:26:41.806 --> 00:26:43.727]  We just had another video taken down last week with us.
[00:26:43.747 --> 00:26:49.109]  They're trying to shut down our channel right now, so there's a real push 12 days out from this election.
[00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:51.550]  Talk about what was on the video that they've banned.
[00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:53.951]  I mean, it was nothing negative.
[00:26:54.311 --> 00:26:55.571]  I mean, no profanity.
[00:26:56.091 --> 00:27:02.434]  All I did was speak about the story of me, Danny Williams, and my claimant, and more than my DNA test.
[00:27:03.676 --> 00:27:05.458]  That's what all of they're trying to ban.
[00:27:05.618 --> 00:27:06.419]  It's my story.
[00:27:06.459 --> 00:27:09.102]  They're trying to keep me from putting my story out there.
[00:27:09.642 --> 00:27:12.365]  So, they're basically, you know, trying to cover it all up.
[00:27:25.287 --> 00:27:28.229]  Yes sir, over 30 million views and back at home.
[00:27:28.249 --> 00:27:30.730]  I was about to say I haven't checked in about a week, wow.
[00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:42.437]  Hundreds of thousands of comments and most of them were telling me what a great job and they proud of me, they support me and never stop searching for my father and all of this.
[00:27:42.818 --> 00:27:50.082]  I don't feel like I did anything to provoke anyone to have my YouTube kicked out, you know?
[00:27:51.543 --> 00:27:52.543]  Well Danny, let me add this.
[00:27:53.925 --> 00:27:55.626]  We never spurred you to say what you said.
[00:27:55.666 --> 00:27:59.248]  I talked to your aunt 20 years ago, but quite frankly, you were on my show a few weeks ago.
[00:27:59.748 --> 00:28:00.909]  All you said was good stuff.
[00:28:00.949 --> 00:28:02.069]  You didn't want to be partisan.
[00:28:02.109 --> 00:28:02.990]  You weren't for Trump.
[00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:07.632]  So you literally put out this thing saying you want a real DNA test.
[00:28:07.652 --> 00:28:11.274]  You're going to file a lawsuit so that Clinton does the DNA test.
[00:28:12.015 --> 00:28:14.076]  And now your YouTube account has been shut down.
[00:28:15.336 --> 00:28:15.797]  Yes, sir.
[00:28:17.778 --> 00:28:19.098]  Well, we knew internet censorship.
[00:28:19.539 --> 00:28:19.919]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:28:21.485 --> 00:28:22.646]  I mean, you can go ahead.
[00:28:22.666 --> 00:28:23.828]  I was just picking up on that.
[00:28:23.848 --> 00:28:30.195]  I mean, I don't, I don't see why I went wrong there to be, to be pushed out, you know, trying to, you know, to be covered up.
[00:28:30.215 --> 00:28:32.558]  My son is just, they're just trying to cover it up.
[00:28:33.259 --> 00:28:39.967]  And I don't see why, nothing I went wrong there to, to, uh, disrespect anyone, nor, nor to, to criticize anyone.
[00:28:40.327 --> 00:28:42.690]  Well, I gotta say one thing about you, Danny Williams.
[00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:44.112]  If anybody's respectful, it's you.
[00:28:44.132 --> 00:28:45.234]  I mean, you are a gentleman.
[00:28:45.634 --> 00:28:48.058]  You're a hard-working man with, was it, five children.
[00:28:49.299 --> 00:28:52.504]  And here you are, just simply calling for an investigation.
[00:28:52.524 --> 00:28:55.748]  Your aunt took you when you were just a little boy to try to get us a mansion.
[00:28:55.768 --> 00:28:56.529]  They ran you off.
[00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:59.871]  And Clinton was known for all of this and now it's coming out.
[00:28:59.911 --> 00:29:03.273]  But regardless, I think this adds a lot of credibility to your story.
[00:29:04.033 --> 00:29:09.075]  That YouTube has just, they say in this release, we can put it on screen, that they're never going to reverse this.
[00:29:09.115 --> 00:29:11.416]  That it's serious what you did.
[00:29:11.496 --> 00:29:17.319]  All you did was stand up and say that you were told Bill Clinton was your father and you want a paternity test.
[00:29:21.038 --> 00:29:31.671]  Well, what is the statement you'd like to make, because tens of millions watch these videos, to Obama, to Hillary, to the establishment, to Bill, to YouTube.
[00:29:31.751 --> 00:29:33.032]  I mean, what do you want to say to them right now?
[00:29:34.622 --> 00:29:38.664]  I mean, I just want to say to him, you know, I will not stop this.
[00:29:38.764 --> 00:29:39.664]  I will keep going.
[00:29:39.704 --> 00:29:47.168]  I'm going to try my best to post up another YouTube video, and respectfully as I can be, and I'm going to continue on my search.
[00:29:47.328 --> 00:29:54.732]  And I would like to ask you guys to please to step up and submit to this DNA test, you know?
[00:29:55.932 --> 00:29:57.073]  Agree to it, you know?
[00:29:57.113 --> 00:29:57.473]  I mean...
[00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:01.751]  It's amazing.
[00:30:01.871 --> 00:30:06.077]  Well, again, on our Facebook, it has 2 million views.
[00:30:06.597 --> 00:30:07.478]  We can put it on screen.
[00:30:07.879 --> 00:30:09.361]  On our YouTube, it has a couple million views.
[00:30:09.721 --> 00:30:12.525]  But on your Facebook, last time I saw it, it was 20 million.
[00:30:12.545 --> 00:30:13.246]  I guess it's grown.
[00:30:13.847 --> 00:30:15.048]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:30:15.349 --> 00:30:16.570]  I didn't look at your YouTube.
[00:30:16.871 --> 00:30:19.214]  How many views did this video have that took off YouTube?
[00:30:21.307 --> 00:30:26.390]  They had like over 20 million views.
[00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:29.151]  They had like over 30 million views.
[00:30:29.531 --> 00:30:29.731]  Wow.
[00:30:29.812 --> 00:30:32.673]  And they had like over 100,000 comments.
[00:30:33.373 --> 00:30:38.136]  I mean, it just was... Well, no wonder they took it down because I was told it was the number one video on YouTube.
[00:30:38.216 --> 00:30:39.677]  I didn't even know you had that on YouTube.
[00:30:39.697 --> 00:30:39.977]  Wow.
[00:30:40.177 --> 00:30:41.137]  I knew Facebook was big.
[00:30:42.618 --> 00:30:43.399]  Well, I had it.
[00:30:43.419 --> 00:30:45.920]  I searched it on my Facebook and also on YouTube too.
[00:30:48.052 --> 00:30:49.934]  Well, they think everybody's dumb.
[00:30:50.054 --> 00:30:53.977]  I mean, you have a right to put up your YouTube channel and politely say you believe this man's your father.
[00:30:53.997 --> 00:30:55.758]  Correct.
[00:30:56.159 --> 00:30:58.421]  And I also put up a GoFundMe, y'all.
[00:30:58.541 --> 00:31:06.748]  We wanted to raise money to help the lawyers, because we're trying to have as soon here in Arkansas as soon as possible.
[00:31:07.668 --> 00:31:09.790]  Oh, that's why they're upset and took the whole channel down.
[00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:10.230]  Why?
[00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:12.773]  Because they didn't just take the video down, they took the channel down.
[00:31:14.014 --> 00:31:14.274]  Right.
[00:31:16.189 --> 00:31:17.770]  Well, Google owns Facebook.
[00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:22.715]  Right, they just got rid of the video off YouTube.
[00:31:22.735 --> 00:31:26.078]  Well, Google owns Facebook and they admit they work for the White House.
[00:31:26.999 --> 00:31:29.381]  So, this is directly for the Clintons and the White House.
[00:31:29.401 --> 00:31:30.842]  What do you want to say to Google?
[00:31:30.862 --> 00:31:36.287]  I just want to say, I just want to get to the end of this.
[00:31:36.307 --> 00:31:38.108]  I just want to ask Clinton to step up.
[00:31:43.211 --> 00:31:52.473]  And uh, you know, I want to ask Jimmy, you know, respectfully as I could, to, you know, not get in the way of, you know, just between me and Bill Clinton.
[00:31:54.794 --> 00:32:11.118]  I mean, and I also, before I go, if any of my supporters want to reach out and help fund this story of mine, you can reach us on Facebook at Danny Williams, or you can e-mail me at DannyOscoWilliams at gmail.com.
[00:32:12.847 --> 00:32:16.688]  Well, Bill Clinton's reported son has his YouTube shut down in a desperate attempt.
[00:32:17.189 --> 00:32:18.809]  Danny, I know you told me you had like five minutes.
[00:32:18.829 --> 00:32:20.150]  You're about to pull up and pick your kids up.
[00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:21.430]  I'm going to let you go.
[00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:23.071]  I'll call you back as soon as you pick them up.
[00:32:23.091 --> 00:32:26.632]  We'll talk about this, but anything else you'd like to add to the viewers out there?
[00:32:28.973 --> 00:32:31.994]  Would you please take the test?
[00:32:32.014 --> 00:32:32.734]  Sure do, Alex.
[00:32:33.274 --> 00:32:34.454]  So you're talking to Bill Clinton right now.
[00:32:34.474 --> 00:32:35.295]  What do you want to say to Bill Clinton?
[00:32:36.335 --> 00:32:38.376]  I just want to ask him, would he please take the test?
[00:32:38.416 --> 00:32:41.597]  And I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on your show.
[00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:43.029]  All right, Danny.
[00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:44.211]  I'll call you right back, okay?
[00:32:45.392 --> 00:32:45.612]  All right.
[00:32:46.072 --> 00:32:46.292]  Thank you.
[00:32:46.312 --> 00:32:46.813]  God bless you.
[00:32:47.874 --> 00:32:50.015]  They're scared of this Danny Williams because he's Bill Clinton's son.
[00:32:50.376 --> 00:32:51.217]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[00:32:51.237 --> 00:32:53.038]  We're going to make sure his story gets out.
[00:32:53.058 --> 00:32:54.980]  We're going to basically die trying.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:56.661]  Infowars.com.
[00:32:56.941 --> 00:32:57.342]  Stay with us.

[00:34:04.926 --> 00:34:09.888]  Now another shirt that was designed and licensed from Roger Stone is the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[00:34:10.548 --> 00:34:13.229]  Looks like the, you know, communist style Obama Hope shirt.
[00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:19.932]  But says, rape, wear it, get aggressive, start the conversations, get on TV with it.
[00:34:19.952 --> 00:34:20.973]  In fact, I'm going to say this right now.
[00:34:21.393 --> 00:34:31.577]  Anyone that gets on national TV with the shirt, clearly, for more than five seconds, gets a thousand dollars.
[00:34:33.183 --> 00:34:34.784]  That means, you know, behind cameras, you name it.
[00:34:34.945 --> 00:34:45.894]  Anyone that gets it on air on national TV and gets the words out, Bill Clinton is a rapist, or things along that line with a bullhorn, I could go to this right now. $5,000.
[00:34:49.884 --> 00:34:52.287]  Until a budget of $100,000 has been spent.
[00:34:52.668 --> 00:34:54.150]  Adoptable dogs.
[00:34:54.250 --> 00:35:00.799]  Every year, the Best Friends Animal Society helps cats and dogs who are stuck in animal shelters find homes.
[00:35:05.686 --> 00:35:11.252]  I think one of the things that we really need to be looking at in this debate is that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:35:11.413 --> 00:35:12.374]  Infowars.com.
[00:35:12.474 --> 00:35:13.395]  Infowars.com.
[00:35:13.555 --> 00:35:14.436]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[00:35:14.776 --> 00:35:15.818]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:35:16.038 --> 00:35:16.258]  Alright.
[00:35:16.278 --> 00:35:17.199]  Bill Clinton.
[00:35:17.219 --> 00:35:23.927]  I got this Hillary for Prison t-shirt and I just want everyone to know about this big presidential campaign that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:35:24.047 --> 00:35:24.788]  Infowars.com.
[00:35:25.743 --> 00:35:26.123]  Okay.
[00:35:26.263 --> 00:35:27.604]  Thank you very much, Terrence.
[00:35:27.964 --> 00:35:29.585]  He doesn't age.
[00:35:29.805 --> 00:35:30.725]  No, he doesn't.
[00:35:30.765 --> 00:35:32.106]  He looks great.
[00:35:32.146 --> 00:35:33.907]  We're all gonna rickroll.
[00:35:34.187 --> 00:35:34.787]  Exactly.
[00:35:34.867 --> 00:35:37.929]  We've had a $100,000 contest before.
[00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:42.591]  My budget's $100,000.
[00:35:42.731 --> 00:35:46.293]  That means if a bunch of people do this, I'll pay up to $100,000 and stop it.
[00:35:56.971 --> 00:36:01.394]  That's $1,000 if you just get the shirt on national TV.
[00:36:03.135 --> 00:36:04.276]  Visually, rape.
[00:36:05.477 --> 00:36:05.757]  Okay?
[00:36:06.837 --> 00:36:07.218]  It is.
[00:36:08.493 --> 00:36:11.916]  It is $5,000 if you get the audio.
[00:36:11.956 --> 00:36:12.556]  Legally and lawfully.
[00:36:12.576 --> 00:36:21.983]  They've got to be outdoors, on their little bench, you've got to have a bullhorn, you've got to have the shirt on or have somebody with it, or maybe a big sign with it on it, and two of you hold it up, and then somebody else bullhorns.
[00:36:22.383 --> 00:36:25.545]  Bill Clinton is a rapist, not a philanderer.
[00:36:26.126 --> 00:36:27.567]  Hillary covers up the rape.
[00:36:32.478 --> 00:36:35.140]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.403]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[00:36:38.423 --> 00:36:39.524]  Because it's already here.
[00:36:39.924 --> 00:36:40.584]  It's being announced.
[00:36:40.925 --> 00:36:44.387]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[00:36:44.808 --> 00:36:46.709]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:36:46.869 --> 00:36:48.411]  A new battleship in the fight.
[00:36:48.611 --> 00:36:49.612]  InfoWars Live.
[00:36:49.792 --> 00:36:50.612]  Available right now.
[00:36:50.893 --> 00:36:52.254]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[00:36:52.694 --> 00:36:55.076]  You gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[00:36:55.796 --> 00:36:56.697]  Or you gonna be part of history?
[00:36:57.258 --> 00:37:00.260]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.341]  Take action!
[00:37:05.988 --> 00:37:11.130]  Why is the federal government trying to circumvent our own laws when it comes to illegal immigration and border crossing?
[00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:14.192]  There's a scathing report in Palazat right now.
[00:37:14.292 --> 00:37:15.612]  It talks about this issue.
[00:37:16.052 --> 00:37:20.874]  Guys, we're looking at between 500 and 800 people crossing the border illegally every day.
[00:37:21.055 --> 00:37:22.995]  Catch and release program is what they're calling it.
[00:37:23.556 --> 00:37:26.517]  I'm joined in studio now by Leanne McAdoo and Owen Troyer.
[00:37:26.917 --> 00:37:28.018]  We're going to be discussing this.
[00:37:28.058 --> 00:37:31.000]  So this report comes out, but very little is done about it.
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.040]  It is remarkable.
[00:37:32.441 --> 00:37:34.182]  500 to 800 people catch a release.
[00:37:34.422 --> 00:37:36.403]  They're comparing it to a speeding ticket.
[00:37:36.443 --> 00:37:37.244]  That's what's happening.
[00:37:37.424 --> 00:37:37.744]  Ticket.
[00:37:37.964 --> 00:37:38.345]  Goodbye.
[00:37:38.365 --> 00:37:43.028]  Well, and the crazy thing is we're talking about complete lawlessness here, right?
[00:37:43.408 --> 00:37:50.333]  You know, we're talking about, oh, are the Russians, you know, in, you know, somehow into getting into our elections, but
[00:37:50.993 --> 00:37:53.796]  You know, we've got immigrants coming in interfering with our elections.
[00:37:53.856 --> 00:37:56.538]  We've got the Democratic Party caught interfering with elections.
[00:37:56.879 --> 00:38:01.123]  So we just completely ignore the law when it comes to domestic interference.
[00:38:01.443 --> 00:38:07.489]  But for some reason, with yet any evidence from our government, we're supposed to be worried about Russia interfering with our elections.
[00:38:07.789 --> 00:38:11.032]  It's very strange to talk about all this lawlessness and completely ignore it.
[00:38:11.212 --> 00:38:22.080]  Right, and of course, anytime you bring it up, you're immediately chastised, and how can you be racist or xenophobic against this, and let's, you know, America is a country built on immigrants, and that's not what this is about.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:28.504]  This is about illegal immigration, and there is a concerted effort to get as many people in this country to vote Democratic as possible.
[00:38:29.005 --> 00:38:31.006]  This is a pet project for a lot of these people.
[00:38:31.046 --> 00:38:38.752]  They want to come in and get this DACA passed, and that's all they care about, and just making sure that they're going to continue to get those Democratic handouts.
[00:38:39.502 --> 00:38:47.653]  You mentioned the lawbreakers and the people in power, like Hillary Clinton right now, who want to legalize just rubber stamp this through.
[00:38:47.693 --> 00:38:49.936]  We've heard it called the Dream Act, you know, through Congress.
[00:38:49.956 --> 00:38:50.817]  They keep renaming it.
[00:38:51.198 --> 00:38:56.065]  But the bottom line is we're talking about 11 plus million people that have entered the country illegally.
[00:38:56.465 --> 00:38:56.645]  Thank you.
[00:39:16.202 --> 00:39:19.643]  7,500 deaths at the hands of illegals each and every year in this country.
[00:39:20.043 --> 00:39:23.224]  Law-abiding citizens are killed by illegal aliens.
[00:39:23.604 --> 00:39:26.185]  Many of those, of course, are driving-related.
[00:39:26.225 --> 00:39:27.065]  They're accidents.
[00:39:27.125 --> 00:39:33.307]  But nonetheless, it seems to be the wild, wild West when it comes to this, this dirty little secret that we have.
[00:39:33.367 --> 00:39:34.627]  Nobody wants to talk about it.
[00:39:35.107 --> 00:39:37.928]  And yet, Democrats, they just want to rubber-stamp it on through.
[00:39:38.388 --> 00:39:50.354]  And you talk about the illegals that are coming here from across the border, but we've got actual moms in the United States illegally giving birth to 275,000 babies.
[00:39:50.755 --> 00:39:52.356]  That was just in 2014 alone.
[00:39:52.736 --> 00:39:53.996]  Don't you need an ID?
[00:39:54.036 --> 00:39:56.878]  Don't you need some sort of a proof to go through this process?
[00:39:56.958 --> 00:40:00.360]  Isn't there something along the way that can catch these people?
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:23.616]  I don't want to sit here and try to make it harder on a mom to have a kid but I mean you know we're talking about the law here and there's another industry that's booming right now and that's the illegal smuggling industry and now the smugglers are telling the illegal people crossing the border that if Hillary Clinton gets elected that there'll be some sort of amnesty and they need to get here by a certain date and on the reverse end they're saying that if they don't
[00:40:24.376 --> 00:40:27.678]  And Trump gets in, there's going to be a magic wall that gets built the next day.
[00:40:28.018 --> 00:40:41.185]  So basically these smugglers are taking advantage of this opportunity, scaring people into wanting to come here before either Trump builds a wall or stops the Hillary Clinton amnesty program, which is a reason why they want to come here and get a right to vote.
[00:40:41.345 --> 00:40:48.853]  Right, that there was this message being put out there that they had to get here before a certain cut-off time because Obama was going to give them this amnesty.
[00:40:48.873 --> 00:40:51.776]  Now they're saying, definitely you got to get here before the election.
[00:40:52.116 --> 00:41:00.746]  And of course, President Obama has tried to really push back against that rhetoric and put the message out there, this will only apply to people who have been in the country
[00:41:01.346 --> 00:41:02.267]  Since X date.
[00:41:02.327 --> 00:41:04.328]  Not if you just got here yesterday.
[00:41:04.348 --> 00:41:08.830]  It only goes back so far, but that message isn't getting across to people.
[00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:14.153]  They really truly feel they can come here and just say papers and they're free to stay.
[00:41:14.533 --> 00:41:18.735]  You mentioned that the birth or citizen aspect of having a child here.
[00:41:18.755 --> 00:41:20.256]  We know that through our constitution, through our
[00:41:20.356 --> 00:41:20.556]  I think so.
[00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:38.391]  The illegal has every right that you and I have.
[00:41:38.411 --> 00:41:39.551]  They're protected in our laws.
[00:41:39.811 --> 00:41:47.194]  There was a case coming out of Nashville where an illegal alien had a baby in a hospital and ICE went to the hospital to apprehend her.
[00:41:47.234 --> 00:41:52.416]  She ended up suing the city and obtaining an insane amount of money because of the way that she was handled.
[00:41:52.576 --> 00:41:53.697]  We have sanctuary cities.
[00:41:53.717 --> 00:41:56.478]  This is a real thing here and it's really bankrupting our system.
[00:41:56.798 --> 00:42:03.002]  Well, and in some cases, I think that you could make the case that illegal immigrants get more rights than citizens, even.
[00:42:03.102 --> 00:42:03.302]  Right.
[00:42:03.362 --> 00:42:07.484]  Or, you know, a more lenient law, you know, justice, if you will.
[00:42:07.664 --> 00:42:20.051]  Under this catch and release, there were cases where, drunk driving incidents, there was one coming out of California where a man actually hit someone, he was drunk driving, he was immediately released, serial drunk driver, he hit a number of people, you're absolutely right, if that had been a U.S.
[00:42:20.112 --> 00:42:24.054]  citizen, he would have gone through the process of law, but it seems to be this black hole
[00:42:24.755 --> 00:42:26.137]  We're not really sure what to do.
[00:42:26.197 --> 00:42:27.158]  It's a catch and release.
[00:42:27.198 --> 00:42:28.540]  That's what this article is calling it.
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:28.780]  Right.
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:32.125]  They can make the excuse that they don't understand our legal system here.
[00:42:32.145 --> 00:42:36.852]  Maybe they're allowed to have a certain amount of drinks before they go driving.
[00:42:37.233 --> 00:42:38.595]  And so here it's a little bit different.
[00:42:38.655 --> 00:42:40.818]  But just to kind of give you an idea of how
[00:42:41.578 --> 00:42:48.762]  In line, these people that are coming here illegally, the lawbreakers, these are criminals, how they're in line with the Democratic Party.
[00:42:49.322 --> 00:42:54.005]  We have illegal immigrants actually going door to door on behalf of Hillary Clinton.
[00:42:54.045 --> 00:42:59.868]  So they can't vote because they're here illegally, but they're going to get out the vote and get people to sign up.
[00:43:00.048 --> 00:43:08.512]  And they're putting out this rhetoric that if we don't get DACA passed, then Donald Trump is going to round everybody up, FEMA camp style, and ship out their families.
[00:43:08.792 --> 00:43:19.343]  We've seen in the Project Veritas video, too, that the Democratic Party is open to working with people to get illegal immigrants jobs, get them IDs, and then get them into the voting booth.
[00:43:19.363 --> 00:43:25.629]  People are even saying, though, Democrats are saying, I should say, that if you're asking for an ID at a polling station, you're a racist.
[00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:26.931]  You're not allowed to do that.
[00:43:26.971 --> 00:43:28.432]  You know, IDs are racist.
[00:43:28.693 --> 00:43:31.576]  Don't you dare do that to be able to prove that you're an actual citizen.
[00:43:32.396 --> 00:43:34.218]  Uh, and we know that they're, they're gaming the system.
[00:43:34.258 --> 00:43:40.566]  They have a group of people, they need their votes and they're doing it by any means necessary and they're breaking all of our laws in the meantime.
[00:43:40.586 --> 00:43:46.693]  It's really upsetting to me because I know what it's doing to our system and we don't have the resources for this and yet we're doing it anyway.
[00:43:47.073 --> 00:43:50.415]  Right, and that's what a lot of the things that they're pushing back against with Obamacare.
[00:43:50.435 --> 00:44:08.769]  People are seeing massive rise in the price of their premiums and this is because there's so many people, A, that are very sick on the systems, healthy people aren't opting in, but so many people that are getting government assistance, who are these people that aren't buying into the system, paying into the system?
[00:44:09.465 --> 00:44:13.368]  Well, and you know, Trump has come a long way talking about the wall.
[00:44:13.448 --> 00:44:14.630]  A lot of people love the wall.
[00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:16.271]  We hear people chanting, build that wall.
[00:44:16.291 --> 00:44:17.012]  But think about this.
[00:44:17.052 --> 00:44:18.012]  You alluded to this earlier.
[00:44:18.633 --> 00:44:24.318]  Data show that in 2014, 7% of all births were to illegal parents.
[00:44:24.498 --> 00:44:24.798]  Okay?
[00:44:24.818 --> 00:44:27.200]  Now, as you said, these are legal citizens.
[00:44:27.261 --> 00:44:28.101]  That is the law.
[00:44:28.462 --> 00:44:30.223]  So, these are technically Americans.
[00:44:30.263 --> 00:44:31.184]  So, what can you do?
[00:44:31.224 --> 00:44:33.166]  What kind of laws can you make to try to avoid this?
[00:44:33.466 --> 00:44:34.427]  Well, you say, okay, look.
[00:44:34.767 --> 00:44:38.329]  We hate to do this to you, but we're not in a moral industry here.
[00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:41.570]  We're in politics and law and justice, and guess what?
[00:44:41.651 --> 00:44:46.093]  You had this child here illegally, and we're going to have to go ahead and deport you.
[00:44:46.413 --> 00:44:48.174]  Now, your child is American.
[00:44:48.194 --> 00:44:54.097]  Your child can stay, but unfortunately, because you broke the law, you're going to have to face the justice of being separated from your child.
[00:44:54.157 --> 00:45:00.100]  I have a feeling that we might have a different number than 7% born to illegal parents, and it goes on to say the guy who
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:00.920]  I think so.
[00:45:19.964 --> 00:45:24.069]  Believe how quickly the illegal immigrants dried up on the border.
[00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:37.627]  That's all you need is a little law, a little justice, and then actually allowing the agents to execute the law instead of just claiming, I don't know, I guess racism, don't write them a ticket, I don't understand, we need these voters, I don't know how they're getting away with it.
[00:45:37.927 --> 00:45:39.968]  I don't even know why we have the ticket system.
[00:45:40.108 --> 00:45:42.930]  I mean, catch and release, doesn't that seem a little bit redundant?
[00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:43.951]  Why do we even ticket?
[00:45:43.991 --> 00:45:50.615]  Why don't we just, you know, we should be there with snacks and water and a map, literally, and translators at this point.
[00:45:50.635 --> 00:45:52.176]  Because that's how ridiculous this is.
[00:45:52.236 --> 00:45:53.237]  Air-conditioned buses.
[00:45:53.497 --> 00:45:54.438]  Seriously.
[00:45:54.458 --> 00:45:55.538]  Well, they've already got that.
[00:45:55.859 --> 00:45:58.380]  They come and say, oh, I've got a cousin in Boston.
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:45:59.981]  They'll bus you up to Boston.
[00:46:00.281 --> 00:46:01.102]  You know what I'm thinking?
[00:46:01.122 --> 00:46:06.946]  I'm going to go across the border as Jorge Posada and say I've got a cousin in Hawaii.
[00:46:07.526 --> 00:46:08.666]  I think I'm moving to Hawaii, guys!
[00:46:08.686 --> 00:46:10.407]  How about that?
[00:46:10.487 --> 00:46:11.367]  I think you can.
[00:46:11.487 --> 00:46:18.228]  I've actually looked into buying property and stuff in Mexico and it's much more difficult as an American citizen to go into Mexico.
[00:46:18.268 --> 00:46:21.129]  You have to have like $30,000 in your bank account.
[00:46:21.169 --> 00:46:23.629]  You have to be able to add to their economy, to their system.
[00:46:24.009 --> 00:46:26.550]  So it's just insane the way we do things here.
[00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:29.270]  Wait a second, they have laws that we have to abide by?
[00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:29.730]  What?
[00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:31.831]  We have to prove that we can contribute to society?
[00:46:31.851 --> 00:46:32.931]  The double standards are absurd.
[00:46:33.371 --> 00:46:46.084]  Seriously, just one quick point, you know, if they're taking advantage of this system, can you imagine, you know, we've heard this before, other groups that understand how soft and porous our border is, they're going to do the same thing as well if we don't get a handle on this soon.
[00:46:46.765 --> 00:46:50.829]  Well, 12 days ahead of an election, it's going to be really interesting how this issue turns out.
[00:46:50.849 --> 00:46:54.453]  I'm joined in studio by Leanne McAdoo and Owen Schroyer.
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:07.959]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.244 --> 00:48:52.725]  I don't know.
[00:49:06.516 --> 00:49:08.697]  Do you hear that knock on your door?
[00:49:08.917 --> 00:49:23.343]  Could it be an illegal alien canvassing your neighborhood begging you to vote for Hillary Clinton, the criminal candidate that will fight for the 750,000 illegals under DACA that has already been struck down by the Supreme Court?
[00:49:23.443 --> 00:49:33.808]  The propaganda shills at the Washington Post report, quote, four years after the DACA program was launched, many of the beneficiaries are still in a kind of limbo.
[00:49:33.988 --> 00:49:35.729]  I will do what I can as President.
[00:49:35.789 --> 00:49:42.113]  I'm hoping if we win back the Senate and we win the White House again, the Republicans are going to see the error of their ways and quit.
[00:49:58.744 --> 00:49:59.345]  We're good.
[00:50:23.743 --> 00:50:30.969]  President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton couldn't even help the people they were attempting to illegally protect.
[00:50:31.029 --> 00:50:36.074]  The American Constitution and the 4-4 vote at the Supreme Court put a stop to that.
[00:50:36.354 --> 00:50:40.498]  Or maybe that knocking at your door is the Pentagon demanding their money back.
[00:50:41.098 --> 00:50:41.699]  We're good to go.
[00:51:03.536 --> 00:51:13.000]  have been ordered to repay large enlistment bonuses and slapped with interest charges, wage garnishments, and tax liens if they refuse.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:23.305]  After audits revealed widespread overpayments by the California Guard at the height of the war's last decade, roughly $30 million needs to be paid back.
[00:51:23.385 --> 00:51:30.588]  Meanwhile, the Pentagon's black budget, taxpayer money, fueling the unconstitutional COG shadow government,
[00:51:30.928 --> 00:51:31.288]  One-fifth!
[00:51:59.319 --> 00:52:01.147]  That would drive premiums down.
[00:52:02.898 --> 00:52:05.620]  Look, once again, there's no sense that it just has to be fixed.
[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:07.562]  The law's working as designed.
[00:52:07.642 --> 00:52:14.307]  Well, whoever it is, you should probably exit your home from a back door and get out there and get in that early vote.
[00:52:14.507 --> 00:52:20.271]  Because at least that vote will put a stop to this bureaucratic liberal madness, right?
[00:52:20.652 --> 00:52:25.135]  Early voter Lisa Howlett reported, Republican straight ticket was highlighted.
[00:52:25.235 --> 00:52:28.477]  However, the Clinton cane box was also highlighted.
[00:52:28.658 --> 00:52:31.500]  I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work.
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:37.384]  Shandi Clark also reported, I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican.
[00:52:37.624 --> 00:52:41.047]  She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton.
[00:52:41.327 --> 00:52:53.336]  Is it any wonder why Hillary Clinton is soaring in all of the fake polls, while her VP candidate can only attract an audience of 30 to his rally, while Trump and Pence bring in tens of thousands?
[00:52:53.656 --> 00:52:57.099]  The entire machine is rigged, not just the voting booths.
[00:52:57.379 --> 00:52:58.019]  We're good to go.
[00:53:23.882 --> 00:53:30.965]  Joining me now is Joe Biggs, and Joe, on Monday I talked about this story briefly, I ran out of time, didn't really have time to talk about it.
[00:53:31.485 --> 00:53:34.827]  It is so outrageous, I really wanted you to talk about this.
[00:53:34.947 --> 00:53:41.189]  Thousands of California soldiers forced to repay enlistment bonuses a decade after going to war.
[00:53:41.229 --> 00:53:47.772]  This is out of the LA Times, and they're talking about nearly 10,000 soldiers who served multiple combat tours
[00:53:48.312 --> 00:53:56.636]  Now, they're being slapped with interest charges, wage garnishments, tax liens, if they're unable to repay this money.
[00:53:56.997 --> 00:54:02.319]  Many of these people are paying debts of about $50,000 because there are multiple bonuses.
[00:54:02.339 --> 00:54:07.482]  A lot of these people re-up for a tour, they go fight the war for the government, and the government says, the hell with you.
[00:54:08.288 --> 00:54:10.029]  This truly is an American horror story.
[00:54:10.109 --> 00:54:13.132]  I mean, only something like this could happen in Obama's America.
[00:54:13.272 --> 00:54:13.472]  Yeah.
[00:54:13.692 --> 00:54:20.097]  I mean, this is a complete and total nightmare because, like you said, there's a lot of people who are about to get out of the military.
[00:54:20.117 --> 00:54:21.118]  Deployment's coming up.
[00:54:21.979 --> 00:54:23.720]  The enlistment guys are going, you know what?
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.281]  These guys are already trained.
[00:54:25.661 --> 00:54:26.622]  Let's give them some money.
[00:54:26.642 --> 00:54:30.465]  That way we can keep them in and not have to worry about paying these new soldiers to come in.
[00:54:30.505 --> 00:54:32.327]  It'll save us some money at the end of the day because
[00:54:32.847 --> 00:54:33.127]  We're good.
[00:54:50.908 --> 00:55:04.925]  And I'm kind of scared because if this ends up being successful, and it is on a lot of people and they're doing this, if the government sees that this is working and people are paying them back, what's to stop them from going and just doing that army-wide and not just the California National Guard?
[00:55:05.166 --> 00:55:06.928]  Can you trust the government to keep its word?
[00:55:07.188 --> 00:55:11.510]  Can you trust them to honor the people who have said, we're going to protect you with our lives.
[00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:12.971]  We're going to go fight your war for you.
[00:55:13.391 --> 00:55:15.733]  Okay, a lot of these people believe that they were doing the right thing.
[00:55:15.773 --> 00:55:19.835]  They believe they're protecting America by going to Iraq or to Afghanistan.
[00:55:19.975 --> 00:55:25.218]  Regardless, the government made a pact with them, said you do this, we'll give you this.
[00:55:25.578 --> 00:55:29.180]  Now the Pentagon is saying, well that was the California National Guard doing that.
[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:30.881]  They don't have the authorization to do it.
[00:55:31.301 --> 00:55:36.703]  But the reality of this that we see happening, let me give you a couple examples of some of the specific instances.
[00:55:36.723 --> 00:55:47.206]  There's a 42-year-old former army captain, refinanced his home mortgage to pay $25,000 in re-enlistment bonuses and $21,000 in student loan repayments.
[00:55:47.706 --> 00:55:48.026]  Okay?
[00:55:48.747 --> 00:55:50.287]  The Pentagon says, oh, you shouldn't have got that.
[00:55:50.307 --> 00:55:52.708]  And he says, well, people like me just got screwed.
[00:55:52.728 --> 00:55:53.088]  That's right.
[00:55:53.328 --> 00:55:53.868]  Here's another one.
[00:55:54.448 --> 00:56:14.415]  Susan Haley, Los Angeles native, former Army Master Sergeant, has to send the Pentagon $650 a month, a quarter of her family's income, to pay down $20,500 in bonuses that the California Guard says, well, we didn't have the authorization to make that promise to you, so we're going to make you pay the money back, not the California National Guard.
[00:56:14.695 --> 00:56:19.937]  And she is somebody, she says she's 47, she served 26 years in the Army, so did her husband,
[00:56:20.197 --> 00:56:24.840]  So did her oldest son, who is a medic, who lost his leg in combat in Afghanistan.
[00:56:25.041 --> 00:56:27.743]  And she says, well, they'll get their money, but I want those years back.
[00:56:27.763 --> 00:56:28.883]  She's not going to get those years back.
[00:56:28.923 --> 00:56:30.445]  Her son's not going to get his leg back.
[00:56:30.965 --> 00:56:35.228]  That's what the government does to you when you rely on their promises.
[00:56:35.328 --> 00:56:37.630]  And we can see this is going to happen with Social Security, right?
[00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:43.194]  They come in, and we just had in the debates, I think it was Cain, called out Donald Trump for saying Social Security is a Ponzi scheme.
[00:56:43.314 --> 00:56:44.275]  It is a Ponzi scheme!
[00:56:44.855 --> 00:56:45.115]  We're good.
[00:56:59.753 --> 00:57:00.133]  We're good.
[00:57:16.698 --> 00:57:20.180]  Okay, then hey, these guys survived, so let's get the money back from them.
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:20.740]  It's disgusting.
[00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:21.480]  I mean, think about this.
[00:57:21.521 --> 00:57:26.403]  Back on September 21st of 2015, Breitbart reported that the U.S.
[00:57:26.423 --> 00:57:30.345]  gave $419 million to Syrian refugees.
[00:57:30.625 --> 00:57:31.165]  There you go.
[00:57:31.185 --> 00:57:33.006]  Yeah, they can have it, but not American citizens.
[00:57:33.046 --> 00:57:35.047]  But not the people who laid down their lives.
[00:57:35.227 --> 00:57:43.872]  You know how many young men I knew who had a baby on the way, who had kids at home waiting, who didn't really even know their father, the babies were born while they were deployed, who never came back home?
[00:57:44.369 --> 00:57:50.533]  And we see that Obama is doing this, and yet look at the way Hillary Clinton treated the people that were protecting her with their lives.
[00:57:50.553 --> 00:57:58.258]  Her security detail, the Secret Service, how she just had vile hatred toward them that we see from everybody that worked on that security detail.
[00:57:58.718 --> 00:58:04.402]  That's the way they appreciate the people who protect them, who do what they say.
[00:58:04.842 --> 00:58:06.203]  That's the way they stabbed them in the back.
[00:58:06.463 --> 00:58:14.888]  I get asked every day, people on Facebook, Twitter, hey, I'm 19, you know, you're an army vet, you know, could you give me some input, some advice, should I join?
[00:58:15.308 --> 00:58:24.714]  You know, and nine times out of ten I say it's a good experience, but after seeing this report and hearing about this, I mean, especially if Hillary Clinton gets in office, she wants war with Russia.
[00:58:25.014 --> 00:58:25.174]  Yeah.
[00:58:25.194 --> 00:58:26.975]  That's a good chance you're not going to come back from that.
[00:58:27.015 --> 00:58:32.637]  These aren't, you know, people living in caves who might get an explosive off every now and then.
[00:58:32.677 --> 00:58:37.059]  These are well-trained people with great military equipment, and that is a full-on battle.
[00:58:37.359 --> 00:58:42.041]  And there's a good chance that you're not going to come back from something like that like we had numbers in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:58:42.061 --> 00:58:43.282]  It's going to be ten times more.
[00:58:43.622 --> 00:58:44.482]  And that's something.
[00:58:44.522 --> 00:58:46.643]  Are you willing to risk your life
[00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:51.886]  And never come home again for a government that could care less about you.
[00:58:52.166 --> 00:58:53.629]  That's all the time we have tonight.

[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.934]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.394 --> 00:59:20.085]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:24.166]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.726 --> 00:59:29.387]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.787 --> 00:59:36.008]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.308 --> 00:59:38.608]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
