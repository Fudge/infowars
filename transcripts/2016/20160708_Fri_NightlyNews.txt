[00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:21.781]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.061 --> 00:00:24.384]  It's Friday, July 8th, 2016.
[00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:25.766]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:32.876]  Tonight, the ambush in Dallas.
[00:00:33.376 --> 00:00:38.443]  Dramatic raw video from the shooting captures the real horror of the event.
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.369]  Meanwhile, despicable Facebook users celebrate the slaughter of Dallas police.
[00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:03.300]  Plus, Alex Jones breaks down how Black Lives Matter is a domestic terrorist organization.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.042]  Rarest forms.
[00:01:05.883 --> 00:01:15.631]  For anybody in this country, it is a red herring that the media and the central government are playing off to cause war, civil war in this country.
[00:01:15.671 --> 00:01:19.895]  All that plus much more, up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:01.098 --> 00:02:06.701]  Last week we pointed out the globalists have declared open season on free individuals and nations worldwide.
[00:02:07.401 --> 00:02:11.023]  When the British left the Euro, the globalists decided to go into high gear.
[00:02:11.343 --> 00:02:15.125]  They've now announced that Hillary won't be indicted no matter how many crimes she commits.
[00:02:15.345 --> 00:02:17.346]  It's time for us to take our matters into our own hands.
[00:02:17.586 --> 00:02:19.828]  The globalist warfare model is siege.
[00:02:20.208 --> 00:02:21.388]  It wants to make us dependent.
[00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:22.789]  It wants to cut off our economies.
[00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.831]  It wants to be able to set up a worldwide financial crisis.
[00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:33.053]  Where there are food shortages that are already happening in most parts of the world, where they basically bring us to our knees and where we capitulate to their demands.
[00:02:33.393 --> 00:02:40.915]  That's why we're extending the July 4th sale right through next week, because it's all about declaring your independence from the globalists.
[00:02:41.155 --> 00:02:47.217]  You don't just declare independence when you buy high-quality, storable foods or water filters or shortwave radios at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:54.185]  You declare your independence when you share links of articles and videos and information from the broadcast because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:02:54.626 --> 00:02:58.028]  It's a total 360 win at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:03:02.295 --> 00:03:07.298]  Of course, our top story today is the tragedy in Dallas at the Black Lives Matter protest.
[00:03:07.778 --> 00:03:12.001]  As the protest was ending, at least one, perhaps more, snipers.
[00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:13.702]  That's one of the most interesting things about this.
[00:03:13.742 --> 00:03:16.344]  We were told that it was initially a triangulated shooting.
[00:03:16.364 --> 00:03:18.045]  That's the way the Dallas Police report it.
[00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:22.387]  Now that they have killed an individual, they're saying he was the lone shooter.
[00:03:22.908 --> 00:03:23.588]  Isn't it interesting?
[00:03:23.628 --> 00:03:24.789]  It's always a lone shooter.
[00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:31.953]  Nevertheless, at this time, the tally stands as five police officers dead, seven wounded, two bystanders wounded.
[00:03:31.993 --> 00:03:33.754]  You don't hear too much about that, actually.
[00:03:34.215 --> 00:03:39.418]  It's being all blamed right now on a former corporal, Micah Xavier Johnson.
[00:03:40.338 --> 00:03:44.161]  And now we've seen copycat shootings happening across the country.
[00:03:44.761 --> 00:03:48.725]  We've seen in Tennessee that a shooter targeted white victims.
[00:03:49.385 --> 00:03:52.048]  Now, these people that were shot, let me read you who they were.
[00:03:52.068 --> 00:03:53.689]  This is a newspaper carrier.
[00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.070]  Jennifer Rooney was killed.
[00:03:55.911 --> 00:04:00.856]  She was shot while she was driving her vehicle, delivering newspapers perhaps, or maybe she was off of work.
[00:04:01.216 --> 00:04:01.797]  She was killed.
[00:04:02.097 --> 00:04:06.141]  Deborah Watts, in serious but stable condition, shot while working at a Days Inn.
[00:04:06.741 --> 00:04:12.506]  Another person received minor injuries at the scene after being injured by flying glass resulting from gunfire.
[00:04:13.126 --> 00:04:17.891]  And Officer Matthew Cousins sustained a superficial wound to the leg.
[00:04:18.351 --> 00:04:20.593]  I think he was the one who stopped the shooter.
[00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:31.202]  But understand, these people, none of them, not even the police officer who was there, had anything at all to do with these shootings in question that the protests were about.
[00:04:31.242 --> 00:04:31.963]  This is in Tennessee.
[00:04:33.137 --> 00:04:35.459]  So this is the climate that we have here.
[00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:45.827]  And in order to understand this climate, you need to understand the mindset that is being sold to people by our political establishment, as we're going to get to here in a moment, our educational establishment.
[00:04:46.268 --> 00:04:49.250]  Because that's really where this began, I believe.
[00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.254]  It goes back to Obama's mentor, Bill Ayers, and the educational establishment.
[00:04:54.715 --> 00:04:56.917]  That's where they invented white privilege.
[00:04:57.637 --> 00:05:05.682]  Now, as we look at this, just understand that if there's a hate crime, there's hatred on the right, it is the fault of the person on the right, we're told.
[00:05:06.103 --> 00:05:09.585]  But if there's hatred and violence from somebody on the left, guess who caused it?
[00:05:10.045 --> 00:05:10.846]  Somebody on the right.
[00:05:11.466 --> 00:05:14.849]  See, it's always people on the right who are to blame, okay?
[00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:16.550]  It's never the left who is to blame.
[00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.193]  They can never generate the hatred on their own, or so we're told.
[00:05:21.857 --> 00:05:27.938]  And of course, if it's a black person that does this, it's still the fault of a white person somewhere.
[00:05:28.438 --> 00:05:30.799]  Now Jesse Jackson is a perfect example of this.
[00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:32.839]  He's blaming Trump for this.
[00:05:33.739 --> 00:05:39.541]  This is Jesse Jackson speaking in the aftermath of the coordinated attack on 11 police in Dallas.
[00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:44.822]  He called on President Obama to hold a conference on violence and racial disparities.
[00:05:45.902 --> 00:05:47.022]  We're good to go.
[00:06:07.967 --> 00:06:12.953]  He's been talking about immigration and black people are not immigrating into this country.
[00:06:13.413 --> 00:06:15.315]  We're talking about other issues.
[00:06:15.336 --> 00:06:19.140]  That's probably the one area that we're not getting a lot of immigration from, okay?
[00:06:19.761 --> 00:06:28.571]  But then of course we have Barack Obama and Attorney General Lynch joining in and encouraging Black Lives Matter to keep this up.
[00:06:29.867 --> 00:06:35.090]  Attorney General Lynch said members of Black Lives Matter movement need to keep letting their voices be heard.
[00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:47.196]  And Obama, while he blames guns and gun owners and says this is another reason we have to have gun control, he goes on to say that when people say Black Lives Matter, it doesn't mean that blue lives don't matter.
[00:06:47.456 --> 00:06:49.377]  Well, he ought to look at social media.
[00:06:49.897 --> 00:06:54.840]  Because there's been a lot of Twitter wars and Facebook wars over that very issue.
[00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.202]  No, they don't like the fact that you use an all lives matter hashtag.
[00:06:59.662 --> 00:07:03.286]  This is about creating tribalism and racial division.
[00:07:03.707 --> 00:07:05.108]  And he comes out and says just the opposite.
[00:07:05.128 --> 00:07:09.013]  He says right now the data shows black folks are more vulnerable to these kinds of incidents.
[00:07:09.313 --> 00:07:13.518]  There's a particular burden that is being placed on a group of our fellow citizens.
[00:07:13.798 --> 00:07:17.382]  So he blames it on firearms and he blames it again on division.
[00:07:18.183 --> 00:07:29.748]  And yet, we hear from the black police chief in Dallas that the shooting suspect wanted to kill white people and police officers, preferably white police officers, and that's what he did.
[00:07:30.148 --> 00:07:35.250]  As a matter of fact, he expressed his anger about Black Lives Matter, and that's what he said.
[00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.711]  He wanted to target people on a racial basis.
[00:07:38.111 --> 00:07:46.174]  We have another black law enforcement officer, David Clark, Milwaukee County Sheriff, coming out and saying, well, you know, quite frankly, it's coming from Obama.
[00:07:46.434 --> 00:07:47.756]  It's not coming from Trump.
[00:07:48.136 --> 00:07:49.978]  He says he didn't cause this, but you know what?
[00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:56.707]  He sort of fuels this anger, that misplaced anger, about things going on that were thousands of miles away.
[00:07:57.267 --> 00:08:03.195]  And again, Obama and Loretta Lynch still fuel that anger in what they're doing.
[00:08:03.235 --> 00:08:04.296]  And you have to look at this and say,
[00:08:05.057 --> 00:08:09.382]  Are we going to allow them to focus us on the guns?
[00:08:10.023 --> 00:08:11.644]  Or on the immediate issues here?
[00:08:12.025 --> 00:08:17.912]  Can we understand the long-term strategy these people have been laying out for a very long time?
[00:08:18.612 --> 00:08:20.234]  This is something, as I mentioned before,
[00:08:21.294 --> 00:08:22.174]  This is a race war.
[00:08:22.915 --> 00:08:27.557]  And it's a race war that's been planned and developed for a long time, along with many other aspects.
[00:08:28.137 --> 00:08:30.699]  One of the aspects of this is to militarize the police.
[00:08:31.479 --> 00:08:33.640]  It is a problem and then a solution.
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.262]  Once they militarize the police, then they create a problem.
[00:08:37.282 --> 00:08:38.403]  They tell them to shoot first.
[00:08:38.503 --> 00:08:41.544]  Once they shoot, empty the gun and whoever you're shooting at.
[00:08:42.064 --> 00:08:47.027]  That is a radical change from the way the police operated just 20 years ago.
[00:08:47.647 --> 00:08:49.528]  Maybe even just 15 years ago, pre 9-11.
[00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:52.318]  That is a radical change.
[00:08:52.378 --> 00:08:53.559]  It's coming from the federal government.
[00:08:53.939 --> 00:08:55.820]  As this creates problems, what do they do?
[00:08:56.381 --> 00:08:57.962]  They step up the militarization.
[00:08:58.382 --> 00:09:01.485]  And they call for more control of the police at the federal level.
[00:09:01.525 --> 00:09:03.226]  And yet, that is the very problem.
[00:09:03.466 --> 00:09:04.467]  That's one aspect of it.
[00:09:04.867 --> 00:09:07.989]  But the other direction in which they come at us is with education.
[00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:16.496]  You have to understand that they sell you a false dichotomy, a political map that gives us these bipolar extremes, okay?
[00:09:16.876 --> 00:09:20.219]  They tell you everything's going to be divided left-right, Democrat-Republican.
[00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:22.040]  Uh, red and blue.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.502]  Or people of color and white people.
[00:09:24.702 --> 00:09:24.942]  Okay?
[00:09:25.203 --> 00:09:26.063]  How simple is that?
[00:09:26.624 --> 00:09:27.845]  Can you make it any simpler?
[00:09:28.145 --> 00:09:29.166]  Any more simple-minded?
[00:09:29.406 --> 00:09:34.891]  You know, they also give you the dichotomy of everything is either fascism or communism if they're coming at us.
[00:09:34.911 --> 00:09:35.991]  Look, understand
[00:09:36.852 --> 00:09:39.773]  That Hitler and Stalin were one and the same.
[00:09:40.493 --> 00:09:42.633]  They were authoritarian dictators.
[00:09:43.194 --> 00:09:46.574]  They were totalitarian regimes that ruled by brutality and mass murder.
[00:09:46.594 --> 00:09:48.015]  It's what we call democide.
[00:09:48.695 --> 00:09:56.217]  If you have it on a proper political spectrum, like the Nolan chart, you can see that they both wind up in the same place and they both call themselves socialists.
[00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:02.099]  So it doesn't matter what your justification is, whether it's nationalism or whether it is internationalism.
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.504]  They want to enact authoritarianism.
[00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:07.449]  And that is what socialism leads us to.
[00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:14.460]  Where this came from, if you want to know the roots of this and where this is immediately descended from, look at Bill Ayers.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:20.804]  Someone who began as a, I guess we could call him, a failed terrorist.
[00:10:20.984 --> 00:10:24.446]  Somebody who came in the very embodiment of white privilege.
[00:10:24.586 --> 00:10:34.051]  This guy had a father who was a CEO of Con Ed, a very wealthy individual, and yet he became a very well-known terrorist with the Weather Underground.
[00:10:35.182 --> 00:10:43.548]  It was interesting, last October, when they were changing the Department of Education head, he said, I'm available, officially, to be the next Secretary of Education.
[00:10:43.588 --> 00:10:46.230]  He tweeted that out as a joke on Twitter.
[00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:57.298]  But you know, it's interesting that the person who was leaving at that point, an individual named Duncan, who left in December, was previously CEO of the Chicago Public Schools.
[00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.519]  And that's where all of this stuff is coming from, quite frankly.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:07.763]  When we look at the history of the Weather Underground, the fact they bombed banks, they bombed the Pentagon with other people.
[00:11:07.923 --> 00:11:13.106]  Interestingly enough, with the Black Panthers, they tried to do a truck heist of $1.6 million.
[00:11:13.486 --> 00:11:14.026]  That failed.
[00:11:15.067 --> 00:11:18.749]  It resulted in the murder of a Brinks guard and two police officers.
[00:11:19.349 --> 00:11:25.953]  And then from 1970 to 73, Ayers' wife, Bernadine Dornan, expressed support for Charles Manson.
[00:11:26.653 --> 00:11:27.414]  And his followers.
[00:11:27.474 --> 00:11:27.854]  Why?
[00:11:27.954 --> 00:11:29.656]  Because they killed pigs.
[00:11:29.836 --> 00:11:30.877]  Because they killed cops.
[00:11:31.397 --> 00:11:32.438]  Are you starting to see a pattern here?
[00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:33.559]  You're going to see more of a pattern here.
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:38.804]  Ayers ultimately got off because the FBI did some illegal snooping.
[00:11:38.824 --> 00:11:40.706]  But of course, nobody gets off for that anymore.
[00:11:41.527 --> 00:11:43.148]  Hillary Clinton gets off no matter what she does.
[00:11:43.188 --> 00:11:45.950]  But the rest of us don't get off because of illegal snooping.
[00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:48.693]  Because they're illegally snooping on all of us.
[00:11:48.793 --> 00:11:50.935]  We would all be immune from all prosecution.
[00:11:50.955 --> 00:11:51.956]  We'd have diplomatic immunity.
[00:11:51.976 --> 00:11:52.757]  But he beat the rap.
[00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.472]  The ultimate white privilege.
[00:11:55.512 --> 00:12:02.678]  Here's a guy who comes from a really wealthy background, he engages in all this terrorism, and then he walks.
[00:12:02.738 --> 00:12:07.622]  And not only does he walk, but he gets a PhD and he goes in to do something that is really dangerous.
[00:12:08.103 --> 00:12:10.465]  To change our educational system.
[00:12:10.745 --> 00:12:14.727]  I want to go back to some quotes from a 1970 book called Weathermen.
[00:12:14.827 --> 00:12:16.347]  This is by Harold Jacobs.
[00:12:16.427 --> 00:12:19.808]  Now he was very supportive of the weather underground and their means.
[00:12:19.868 --> 00:12:21.009]  And here's some of the things that he said.
[00:12:21.049 --> 00:12:28.432]  And see if this doesn't sound like our white privilege social justice warriors that are being brainwashed in our universities today.
[00:12:29.272 --> 00:12:37.376]  He says that at the time they warned against a one-sided response to what Weatherman refers to as white skin privilege.
[00:12:37.436 --> 00:12:38.497]  That was their original term.
[00:12:38.817 --> 00:12:41.179]  That was the term from which we get white privilege.
[00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:42.719]  They called it white skin privilege.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:54.426]  He says he refuses to succumb to the despair implicit in the Weatherman's belief that the majority of whites in this country might be too racist, too defeated, too self-indulgent to make a revolution for themselves.
[00:12:54.986 --> 00:12:55.487]  Sound familiar?
[00:12:55.507 --> 00:12:57.969]  That's what we hear from the university students going on with this.
[00:12:58.369 --> 00:13:01.492]  They tied themselves closely to the black liberation movement.
[00:13:01.792 --> 00:13:05.115]  They felt it was the most important element of the whole process.
[00:13:05.736 --> 00:13:10.320]  As part of the third world opposition, it could eventually bring down the imperial system.
[00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:16.606]  The role of white radicals is primarily, although importantly, supportive and extensive.
[00:13:16.986 --> 00:13:18.588]  See the technique that they're using here?
[00:13:19.088 --> 00:13:20.490]  Focusing on black people.
[00:13:21.553 --> 00:13:26.675]  Jenning up the anger, using them to start a war, and using the white radicals to push that.
[00:13:26.815 --> 00:13:31.236]  And of course, you have to make them radical by selling them the idea of white skin privilege.
[00:13:31.276 --> 00:13:33.637]  It's all originated with Bill Ayers and the Weathermen.
[00:13:33.697 --> 00:13:43.040]  Strategically, they say, work should concentrate on building city-wide movements that are based on intensive youth organizing across a whole range of issues.
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.600]  That's your community organizer network.
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.561]  That's how they put this together.
[00:13:48.482 --> 00:13:49.883]  And so we're seeing the results of this.
[00:13:49.983 --> 00:13:50.623]  One more quote here.
[00:13:51.103 --> 00:13:53.804]  This is from his wife, Bill Ayer's wife, Bernadine Dorn.
[00:13:53.844 --> 00:13:55.925]  She said, You can't just be a bystander.
[00:13:56.005 --> 00:13:57.666]  You can't just be an innocent individual.
[00:13:57.746 --> 00:13:59.447]  No, you are a guilty oppressor.
[00:14:08.951 --> 00:14:11.354]  If you don't join with Black Lives Matter.
[00:14:11.514 --> 00:14:12.455]  We've heard this all before.
[00:14:12.855 --> 00:14:18.721]  Why do you think they're pushing so hard for universal free college education?
[00:14:19.362 --> 00:14:21.624]  It's because their program of indoctrination.
[00:14:21.644 --> 00:14:22.825]  That's what the colleges have become.
[00:14:22.845 --> 00:14:24.387]  They're not so much education anymore.
[00:14:24.947 --> 00:14:27.329]  Especially if you don't major in something technical.
[00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:32.094]  If you go for a liberal arts education or some of these other degrees,
[00:14:32.975 --> 00:14:36.381]  That don't qualify you for any job other than working for the federal government.
[00:14:36.541 --> 00:14:41.129]  They are going to indoctrinate you into the worldview of Bill Ayers.
[00:14:41.369 --> 00:14:44.775]  How did he get to this point where he was so successful?
[00:14:45.424 --> 00:14:48.466]  Take a look at an article that's back in December of 2013.
[00:14:48.526 --> 00:14:50.287]  This is from Breitbart.
[00:14:50.327 --> 00:14:57.452]  And they talk about the educational connections and the Common Core roots that go back to Bill Ayers.
[00:14:57.953 --> 00:15:02.336]  And they point out that Barack Obama didn't simply embrace a concept that others had developed.
[00:15:02.376 --> 00:15:11.803]  Instead, the very roots of Common Core are in the early ideas generated by Obama and his fellow radical community organizer Bill Ayers.
[00:15:12.583 --> 00:15:26.475]  And they point out something that as he was running for president, Stanley Kurtz pointed out that Obama's quote, most important executive experience was to head up the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, the CAC.
[00:15:27.256 --> 00:15:34.022]  He said it was an education foundation that was the invention of Bill Ayers, who of course founded the weather underground in the 1960s.
[00:15:34.342 --> 00:15:38.085]  Now, Obama was the executive in charge of it from 1995 to 1999.
[00:15:40.387 --> 00:15:48.455]  He remained on the board until 2001, and the foundation funneled more than $100 million into community organizations and radical education activists.
[00:15:48.995 --> 00:15:53.680]  The CAC's stated purpose was to improve Chicago's public schools.
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:16:05.171]  Now as chairman, Obama handled the fiscal matters, but Bill Ayers co-chaired the CAC's other key entity, the Collaborative, and there he influenced education policy.
[00:16:05.771 --> 00:16:11.873]  You see, if you want to destroy society, you don't blow up buildings, you don't shoot the police.
[00:16:12.413 --> 00:16:18.815]  What you do is you go into the educational establishment and you foment these ideas for a generation.
[00:16:19.335 --> 00:16:23.496]  And then you start a mass movement of people who will do those very things for you.
[00:16:24.176 --> 00:16:27.140]  Okay, that's ultimately where they're going and that's where we're starting to see this now.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.521]  Where did this come from?
[00:16:28.641 --> 00:16:35.329]  It was a long-term plan by these 1960s radicals who got smart, who went into education.
[00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:39.735]  Because if you can get people's minds at an early age, everybody has always understood this.
[00:16:39.975 --> 00:16:41.437]  Every dictator has understood this.
[00:16:41.877 --> 00:16:42.998]  That's why Hitler had the Hitler Youth.
[00:16:43.258 --> 00:16:48.902]  It's why Plato, going back to ancient Greece when he was talking about his republic, that's why he wanted to destroy the family.
[00:16:48.962 --> 00:16:53.665]  He wanted promiscuity, so that nobody would know who their mothers and fathers were.
[00:16:54.265 --> 00:16:59.509]  He wanted to have the state raise the child, this child only being loyal to the state.
[00:17:00.089 --> 00:17:03.551]  Get them at an early age, and they're yours for the rest of their life.
[00:17:03.791 --> 00:17:07.912]  Especially if you can carry them all the way into college and indoctrinate them.
[00:17:08.893 --> 00:17:18.337]  Now, he goes on to say in this article here, Implementing AIR's radical philosophy in schools required them to associate with external partners, people that we've heard of before, like ACORN.
[00:17:18.357 --> 00:17:19.057]  Okay?
[00:17:19.317 --> 00:17:20.338]  Heard of ACORN before, right?
[00:17:20.898 --> 00:17:27.501]  The CAC, as it was closing down, they created another pilot program called the GROW Network that was starting up in New York.
[00:17:28.081 --> 00:17:32.605]  Acorn, Grow Network, The Connection in New York, as well as in Chicago.
[00:17:32.645 --> 00:17:40.492]  And quite frankly, the guy who did get the job as the new chair of the Department of Education was from New York.
[00:17:40.952 --> 00:17:42.093]  It's New York, Chicago.
[00:17:42.173 --> 00:17:48.038]  The liberals who control those areas, the community organizers, the communist organizers, quite frankly.
[00:17:48.699 --> 00:17:53.263]  Now, this was founded by David Coleman, who is known as the architect of Common Core Standards.
[00:17:53.383 --> 00:17:54.104]  Here's The Connection.
[00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:55.324]  Common Core.
[00:17:55.384 --> 00:17:59.385]  They do not want Johnny to read or write.
[00:18:00.126 --> 00:18:01.886]  They want Johnny to hate.
[00:18:02.866 --> 00:18:09.068]  They want to fill you with nothing but contempt and tribalism and not have the means of production.
[00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:14.230]  They don't want you focused on creating things, on creating jobs, on creating widgets.
[00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:18.391]  They want to create strife and division and take this down.
[00:18:18.451 --> 00:18:20.932]  So they created this Grow Network in New York.
[00:18:21.392 --> 00:18:23.213]  Out of that came Common Core.
[00:18:24.096 --> 00:18:26.097]  That is where we are today, folks.
[00:18:26.797 --> 00:18:28.838]  When we come back, we're going to talk about Hillary Clinton.
[00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:33.721]  She actually spoke today because she had the cover of the Dallas tragedy.
[00:18:34.001 --> 00:18:35.842]  We're going to talk about the timing of all this.
[00:18:35.862 --> 00:18:43.805]  We're going to talk about the response and the fallout with Hillary Clinton because we're not going to let her get away with using this as cover.
[00:18:43.825 --> 00:18:44.206]  Stay with us.
[00:18:44.246 --> 00:18:44.806]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:01.781 --> 00:19:08.866]  These were the chaotic scenes as residents of a city in Southeastern Venezuela went on the rampage in search of basic food items.
[00:19:09.646 --> 00:19:15.570]  People desperate for staples like milk, rice and flour stormed a supermarket warehouse in Guayana City.
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:25.502]  If you go back to 2007, the British Ministry of Defense came out and echoed a Department of Defense report from here in the U.S.
[00:19:25.542 --> 00:19:37.084]  saying that beginning in the year 2016, right through 2020 to 2030, that they believe there would be massive multi-hundred percent food price increases worldwide.
[00:19:37.944 --> 00:19:45.926]  And that during that global meltdown, that there would be incredible social unrest that would depopulate much of the Earth.
[00:19:46.957 --> 00:19:58.285]  Now, in 2016, Vice Magazine and other publications are reporting on a 2015 report produced by the U.S.
[00:19:58.325 --> 00:20:11.134]  government, the U.N., and scores of foreign nations, as well as the State Department, overseen by food giant Cargill, the World Bank, and most importantly, the World Wildlife Fund.
[00:20:11.815 --> 00:20:12.796]  The World Wildlife Fund
[00:20:13.616 --> 00:20:21.863]  is a eugenics anti-human organization set up by Prince Bernhard who also founded the Bilderberg Group and who was a Nazi officer.
[00:20:22.524 --> 00:20:36.556]  This organization sells environmentalism to make the elite look like heroes saving the earth when in truth they are ushering in a planetary tyranny that is irrevocably damaging the fabric of our planet.
[00:20:37.096 --> 00:20:38.658]  In this new FEMA report
[00:20:39.602 --> 00:20:46.185]  With headline, FEMA contractor predicts social unrest caused by 395% food price spikes.
[00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:59.130]  You learn that this is a report filed with governments and major institutions overseen by a contractor that since the 1940s has been the main advisor for the U.S.
[00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.211]  Navy Marine Corps.
[00:21:00.987 --> 00:21:05.932]  The challenges and crises that we were assigned are exactly what we expect to see in the future.
[00:21:05.992 --> 00:21:06.973]  So you've got famine.
[00:21:07.133 --> 00:21:08.535]  You've got increased pests.
[00:21:08.615 --> 00:21:10.156]  Food prices are going up 400%.
[00:21:11.177 --> 00:21:13.039]  We've got a flood of migrants coming in.
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.701]  The world is starting to fall apart.
[00:21:15.021 --> 00:21:17.824]  Everything we do is going to have some negative effect.
[00:21:18.565 --> 00:21:23.270]  Now, all of this said, governments and corporations and institutions
[00:21:23.757 --> 00:21:25.278]  Are stockpiling food and weapons.
[00:21:25.319 --> 00:21:26.059]  They're digging in.
[00:21:26.079 --> 00:21:26.860]  They're getting bunkers.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.484]  Elites are fleeing to places like New Zealand en masse.
[00:21:31.644 --> 00:21:44.896]  We've gone from financial meltdown and huge regional wars being a possibility to being a probability to more and more becoming an inevitability.
[00:21:46.058 --> 00:21:48.720]  Now, the big question is, what are we going to do about it?
[00:21:49.704 --> 00:21:53.987]  The advice I give you is the same advice that I carry out in my own personal life.
[00:21:55.728 --> 00:21:58.449]  Number one, everybody needs to be able to protect themselves.
[00:21:58.609 --> 00:22:01.351]  Everybody needs friends and family they can rely on in crises.
[00:22:01.971 --> 00:22:06.014]  And everyone needs high quality storable foods and high quality water filtration systems.
[00:22:06.614 --> 00:22:08.495]  Not just for collapse when it comes to water filters.
[00:22:08.535 --> 00:22:13.438]  All the garbage in our water, you'd be insane to drink well water or tap water with the glyphosates and all the rest of it.
[00:22:13.859 --> 00:22:18.561]  But we're offering the biggest wide spectrum sale ever on preparedness items.
[00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:23.671]  That's the lowest savings to 40% at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:22:24.191 --> 00:22:31.535]  On Infowars Select, high quality storable foods, the highest quality, the lowest prices, powered by My Patriot Supply.
[00:22:31.555 --> 00:22:33.876]  We also sell their food as well, their full spectrum.
[00:22:34.216 --> 00:22:36.818]  And all of their water filtration systems across the board.
[00:22:37.158 --> 00:22:42.861]  From gravity fed systems like Alexa Pure and Pro Pure, to shower filters, to survival straws,
[00:22:43.328 --> 00:22:49.531]  You name it, it's all 20-40% off right through July 4th at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:22:50.132 --> 00:22:51.813]  I know, I personally am getting prepared.
[00:22:52.373 --> 00:22:53.754]  The warning signs are insane.
[00:22:54.254 --> 00:23:00.718]  Take advantage, 20-40% off until early next week with the 4th of July Holiday Special at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:23:03.476 --> 00:23:04.436]  Timing is everything.
[00:23:05.096 --> 00:23:13.938]  And this last week when we saw what happened with Hillary Clinton and the conclusion of the FBI's investigation into her, the timing should tell you that the fix was in.
[00:23:14.318 --> 00:23:25.521]  We could see this at the beginning of the week and of course it only got worse as the week progressed and we learned that the deposition was going to be on perhaps the slowest news day of the year, the Saturday before 4th of July weekend.
[00:23:25.541 --> 00:23:30.162]  To back that up, take a look at what the AP says about ratings during this period of time.
[00:23:30.842 --> 00:23:32.523]  They say it was no fun for Fox News.
[00:23:32.543 --> 00:23:38.908]  The network recorded the lowest ever viewership average for a week by one of the four biggest broadcast networks.
[00:23:38.948 --> 00:23:42.631]  Now, it wasn't a bad week in general compared to everybody else for Fox.
[00:23:42.651 --> 00:23:46.194]  They say Fox News Channel was the week's most popular cable network.
[00:23:46.694 --> 00:23:47.174]  Nevertheless...
[00:23:48.291 --> 00:23:56.420]  They say because of barbecues, fireworks, other outdoor activities, the weeks around July 4th are often the least watched time of the year in television.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.005]  Networks usually plan accordingly, and so do crooked politicians.
[00:24:01.869 --> 00:24:02.830]  They plan accordingly.
[00:24:03.471 --> 00:24:13.560]  They release their news on a Friday, because they know that people aren't going to be paying that much attention, and they release the really big exposures on the 4th of July weekend.
[00:24:13.881 --> 00:24:14.962]  Something that's really damaging.
[00:24:15.002 --> 00:24:20.187]  Look, they're going to have the Guccifer hearings coming up on Labor Day.
[00:24:20.747 --> 00:24:21.868]  You think that's a coincidence?
[00:24:22.049 --> 00:24:23.130]  It's not a coincidence.
[00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:24.951]  It shows you that the fix has been in.
[00:24:25.819 --> 00:24:32.942]  Now, as we look at this, and as this continues to unfold, Hillary Clinton didn't respond until today.
[00:24:33.422 --> 00:24:35.323]  But people were talking about it earlier in the day.
[00:24:35.343 --> 00:24:40.404]  They said, well, Clinton faces a tough decision as to whether or not she's going to address the media about the FBI.
[00:24:40.445 --> 00:24:41.805]  That was the headline from The Hill.
[00:24:42.205 --> 00:24:47.607]  And The Washington Post says, well, here's exactly how long it's been since Hillary Clinton held a news conference.
[00:24:47.667 --> 00:24:50.748]  Because remember, Loretta Lynch didn't hold a news conference.
[00:24:50.808 --> 00:24:51.989]  She didn't hold a press conference.
[00:24:52.549 --> 00:25:04.749]  She talked to one friendly interviewer who was throwing her softball questions and helping her to present a narrative to diffuse the situation, saying, oh, you wouldn't throw a former president off of the plane, would you?
[00:25:04.809 --> 00:25:06.251]  And you guys were just good friends.
[00:25:06.837 --> 00:25:08.217]  So that's why you didn't recuse yourself.
[00:25:08.978 --> 00:25:20.402]  That's one of the prime reasons you wouldn't recuse yourself, but especially when you're caught on the tarmac in a tete-a-tete with the former president whose wife is under investigation, who himself is under investigation, sources say.
[00:25:20.882 --> 00:25:23.903]  But how long has it been since Hillary Clinton held a press conference?
[00:25:23.923 --> 00:25:26.064]  Well, the Washington Post points out it was December the 4th
[00:25:26.824 --> 00:25:31.047]  2015, they went back and said, well, it's 216 days.
[00:25:31.107 --> 00:25:33.749]  Now it's 217 days because it was yesterday they asked that.
[00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:36.492]  So people were saying, why isn't she holding a press conference?
[00:25:36.512 --> 00:25:46.559]  Well, today she had a one-person interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN, the Clinton News Network, where he asked her some softball questions and let her get away with it, like this.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.782]  Do you acknowledge you were extremely careless?
[00:25:52.110 --> 00:26:02.880]  Well, I think the director clarified that comment to some extent, pointing out that some of what had been thought to be classified apparently was not.
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.923]  The State Department also made that clear.
[00:26:15.532 --> 00:26:18.033]  That some of the things that he thought were classified weren't.
[00:26:18.593 --> 00:26:25.115]  But he pointed out that there were a lot of things that were sent and received as classified documents.
[00:26:25.555 --> 00:26:28.095]  He laid out the case for a felony, then he let her walk.
[00:26:28.595 --> 00:26:30.756]  And as I said, this was orchestrated.
[00:26:31.076 --> 00:26:37.958]  Take a look at what Jerome Corsi at WND pointed out about Comey's long history of helping the Clintons.
[00:26:38.638 --> 00:26:41.441]  Now he goes back and talks, first of all, 2004.
[00:26:41.581 --> 00:26:49.889]  Comey, who was then Deputy Attorney General in the Justice Department, limited the scope of criminal investigation for the Sandy Berger case.
[00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:55.075]  He's always, and always will be, referred to in my family as Sandy the Burglar.
[00:26:55.555 --> 00:26:55.915]  Burger.
[00:26:56.055 --> 00:26:56.356]  Why?
[00:26:56.456 --> 00:27:10.867]  Because he went into the National Archives, took out classified documents, was caught stuffing them in his pants, in his pockets, walked them out of the place, and then was allowed to destroy them outside the National Archives.
[00:27:11.207 --> 00:27:12.288]  Why was he doing that?
[00:27:12.848 --> 00:27:21.835]  He was doing it to cover up some of the security violations and machinations and conspiracy plots, evidently, of the Clinton administration.
[00:27:21.855 --> 00:27:23.036]  The first one, Bill Clinton.
[00:27:24.192 --> 00:27:26.353]  The build-up to the 9-11 terrorist attacks.
[00:27:26.473 --> 00:27:34.815]  He wanted that information out of there because it showed a pattern of behavior that people were starting to tie together with what happened in 9-11.
[00:27:36.216 --> 00:27:37.536]  So he destroyed all those documents.
[00:27:37.556 --> 00:27:38.997]  You want to talk about the missing 28 pages?
[00:27:39.037 --> 00:27:45.219]  What about all these pages that their close associate, Sandy Berger, stuffed in his pants, okay, and got out?
[00:27:46.698 --> 00:27:48.680]  Mr. Comey helped him get away with that.
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.582]  Mr. Comey and Loretta Lynch were both U.S.
[00:27:52.642 --> 00:28:01.329]  attorneys in the Southern District of New York, and they crossed paths in the investigation of HSBC, the bank that was too big to jail.
[00:28:01.529 --> 00:28:02.409]  Just like Hillary Clinton.
[00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:09.514]  The bank that laundered money for terrorists and for drug cartels, and did it not once, but twice.
[00:28:09.615 --> 00:28:13.557]  And it was the second time people said, wait a minute, you already gave them probation, what are you going to do now?
[00:28:13.577 --> 00:28:14.698]  Are you going to jail some of these people?
[00:28:14.718 --> 00:28:15.599]  Are you going to pull their charter?
[00:28:16.019 --> 00:28:18.840]  No, no, said Eric Holder's Justice Department.
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.481]  They're too big to jail, essentially.
[00:28:21.201 --> 00:28:23.782]  And Lynch and Comey were a part of that.
[00:28:24.462 --> 00:28:28.703]  Don't forget also that he was also a part, going back to 1996, 20 years ago.
[00:28:28.723 --> 00:28:30.444]  Remember, there were a lot of scandals.
[00:28:31.164 --> 00:28:44.133]  As Bill Clinton was running for re-election in 1996, there were scandals of selling influence to the Chinese government, of the money flowing into the Democrats' committee as well as to the Clintons.
[00:28:44.634 --> 00:28:49.257]  There was also a Whitewater investigation, and part of that whitewash was, guess who?
[00:28:49.757 --> 00:28:57.003]  James Comey, who was Deputy Special Counsel back in 1996, as part of the Whitewater whitewash.
[00:28:58.103 --> 00:29:05.327]  Now, as we had a questioning of Comey on Capitol Hill, they asked him, well, could she have been fired?
[00:29:05.387 --> 00:29:11.210]  And he said, well, I'm highly confident that there would be no criminal prosecution no matter who it was, he said.
[00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.432]  But there would be a range of discipline if this were to happen.
[00:29:13.732 --> 00:29:17.174]  He said you could be walked out, or depending on the nature of the facts, you could be reprimanded.
[00:29:17.614 --> 00:29:21.819]  The director also said that sitting FBI officials might lose their security clearance.
[00:29:22.279 --> 00:29:27.324]  They might have their clearances reviewed or to be subject to other adjudication on the same matter.
[00:29:27.364 --> 00:29:30.568]  In other words, if she was just an employee, she might have been fired.
[00:29:30.608 --> 00:29:36.414]  And of course, we've seen what happened to people like whistleblowers, especially Thomas Drake, who they...
[00:29:37.375 --> 00:29:41.501]  Classified documents that were in his possession that were not classified and said, well, they're not classified.
[00:29:41.881 --> 00:29:47.929]  You should have known that they were misclassified and so we're going to charge you with having classified documents.
[00:29:47.989 --> 00:29:54.879]  When she had documents that came into her possession immediately that were born classified, they allowed her to walk on that.
[00:29:55.404 --> 00:29:56.385]  An amazing double standard.
[00:29:56.405 --> 00:29:57.926]  We've talked about that before.
[00:29:58.406 --> 00:30:02.188]  But now the State Department is going to reopen a probe into the Clinton emails.
[00:30:02.308 --> 00:30:10.813]  Because even though Hillary couldn't be fired, they're going to look for some people to scapegoat and to fire out of the State Department.
[00:30:11.413 --> 00:30:17.117]  We have Marco Rubio leading the Senate to push a bill to strip Hillary of her security clearance.
[00:30:17.657 --> 00:30:19.538]  Does that sound like that's overly partisan to you?
[00:30:20.339 --> 00:30:23.561]  Understand that during Bill Clinton's administration,
[00:30:24.608 --> 00:30:29.532]  John Deutch, who was the director of the CIA, did exactly what Hillary Clinton did.
[00:30:29.572 --> 00:30:33.375]  Had classified documents on his personal computer at home.
[00:30:33.875 --> 00:30:37.758]  He was not only fired, but he was stripped of his security clearance.
[00:30:38.278 --> 00:30:42.442]  And in order to keep him from going to jail, he was pardoned by Bill Clinton for that as well.
[00:30:42.882 --> 00:30:43.562]  And there's one other...
[00:30:44.423 --> 00:30:47.285]  Possible consequence that may come up, but it's not a consequence at all.
[00:30:47.325 --> 00:30:50.806]  They say they may have a referral for perjury for Hillary Clinton.
[00:30:50.847 --> 00:30:57.790]  They asked the director if anybody had talked to him about her committing perjury to Congress.
[00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:59.991]  And he says, well, nobody has referred that to us.
[00:31:00.031 --> 00:31:02.673]  They said, well, we'll get that to you right away.
[00:31:02.793 --> 00:31:05.735]  But understand, who's going to do the investigation?
[00:31:06.395 --> 00:31:08.156]  Oh, that would be Comey, wouldn't it?
[00:31:08.576 --> 00:31:12.038]  And who would make the decision as to whether or not they were going to prosecute her?
[00:31:12.259 --> 00:31:13.940]  Oh, that would be Loretta Lynch.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:18.022]  So you understand, absolutely nothing is going to happen with that.
[00:31:19.223 --> 00:31:21.385]  Now, real quickly, on another subject.
[00:31:21.625 --> 00:31:33.433]  A judge report has pointed out that Christiana Figueres, a former climate change chief who helped to push through the Paris Climate Change Accord, may become the new head of the UN.
[00:31:34.446 --> 00:31:35.166]  Look at her right there.
[00:31:35.206 --> 00:31:38.888]  Now it's interesting, look at her name, and of course the way she tried to report it was Christiana.
[00:31:38.968 --> 00:31:42.329]  I guess the way we would pronounce that would be Ana Christ.
[00:31:42.609 --> 00:31:54.414]  Because it may very well be, as Alex Jones pointed out in his special report, may very well be the people who come in and mop up the revolution that Bill Ayers and Obama want to start with this race war.
[00:31:55.074 --> 00:32:11.767]  And as we look at this, understand that world government, I believe, is going to come at us through the trade treaties that are being pushed, because that's the way they push consolidation politically, is through economic consolidation, as well as giving a rationale for a global governance through climate change.
[00:32:11.928 --> 00:32:14.410]  That is the imperative that they have to push to people.
[00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:21.095]  That is what people are concerned about on the Democrat side, on Hillary's side, that Bernie Sanders is going to try to push that too hard.
[00:32:21.355 --> 00:32:23.197]  They want to bring it on you gradually.
[00:32:23.757 --> 00:32:25.639]  But things are beginning to accelerate.
[00:32:26.239 --> 00:32:26.679]  Stay with us.
[00:32:26.859 --> 00:32:32.884]  Margaret Hall will break down how the federalization of the police is coming at us, and we're going to talk to people on the street.
[00:32:33.425 --> 00:32:35.626]  Get their impressions of what happened in Dallas.
[00:32:35.706 --> 00:32:36.227]  We'll be right back.
[00:32:46.044 --> 00:32:47.085]  I'm running for president.
[00:32:47.466 --> 00:32:50.690]  Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.
[00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:55.096]  I'm hitting the road to earn your vote, and I hope you'll join me on this journey.
[00:33:02.335 --> 00:33:08.280]  People desperate for staples like milk, rice and flour stormed a supermarket warehouse in Guayana City.
[00:33:09.061 --> 00:33:23.494]  If you go back to 2007, the British Ministry of Defense came out and echoed a Department of Defense report saying that they believe there would be massive multi-hundred percent food price increases worldwide.
[00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:32.382]  And that during that global meltdown that there would be incredible social unrest that would depopulate much of the earth.
[00:33:32.582 --> 00:33:42.131]  Now, Vice Magazine and other publications are reporting on a 2015 report produced by the US government, the UN.
[00:33:42.771 --> 00:33:43.031]  Cut!
[00:33:43.452 --> 00:33:44.372]  We'll stop it right there.
[00:33:45.173 --> 00:33:48.256]  I shot that video, that special, about a week and a half ago.
[00:33:48.536 --> 00:33:55.024]  Before Hillary Clinton was basically given free reign in the United States of America to break any law she wants.
[00:33:55.404 --> 00:34:01.711]  Before more news came out of food riots intensifying in Asia, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, you name it.
[00:34:02.272 --> 00:34:06.597]  Before we got more news of NATO plans to encircle Russia with more troops.
[00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:11.640]  Bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, the world financial economy is melting down by design.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:16.462]  Everything the globalists are doing is about making us dependent on them.
[00:34:17.183 --> 00:34:31.169]  That's why, declaring personal independence, I am announcing that we're extending the record sales of 20-40% off on water filters and X2 survival shield and, of course, the survival food.
[00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:35.972]  I'm extending the 20-40% off for one more week, and then that's it.
[00:34:36.792 --> 00:34:52.546]  But I'm expanding it when it comes to non-GMO heirloom seeds, all sorts of systems to jump your car or to give yourself power during emergencies, and on solar panel systems, and on shortwave radios that are solar powered and crank powered.
[00:34:52.966 --> 00:35:01.794]  So we're going from a few dozen items that are discounted to more than a hundred right now at InfoWarsStore.com, and we're running it right
[00:35:02.094 --> 00:35:04.755]  Through to the beginning of next week.
[00:35:05.075 --> 00:35:12.038]  It is the biggest sale ever on preparedness and survival systems because the globalists want us totally dependent on them.
[00:35:12.058 --> 00:35:15.279]  We need to be independent ourselves, or at least start that journey.
[00:35:15.639 --> 00:35:18.740]  But there's another aspect of this that makes it an absolute no-brainer.
[00:35:19.521 --> 00:35:30.105]  When you get the high-quality non-GMO seeds, open-pollinated heirloom, when you get high-quality water filtration systems, massively discounted, or nutraceuticals, when you get high-quality storable foods,
[00:35:30.925 --> 00:35:32.954]  You're not just making yourself more independent.
[00:35:34.096 --> 00:35:42.160]  You're also funding InfoWars that is just breaking international news every day and really giving the globalists a major run for their money.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:47.542]  So you don't just get great prices, you don't just support the InfoWars, you support yourself and your family at the same time.
[00:35:47.842 --> 00:35:48.963]  It's an absolute no-brainer.
[00:35:48.983 --> 00:35:53.104]  I want to thank all of you that have come to InfoWarsStore.com and who have supported what we're doing.
[00:35:53.324 --> 00:35:55.986]  And I want to encourage those of you that haven't, check it out today.
[00:35:56.386 --> 00:36:00.608]  It's a total 360 win at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:36:01.568 --> 00:36:09.430]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:11.751]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:36:11.911 --> 00:36:14.532]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:36:14.612 --> 00:36:18.713]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:36:19.033 --> 00:36:22.174]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:36:22.194 --> 00:36:29.456]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:36:29.656 --> 00:36:33.780]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.621]  We are the true media.
[00:36:35.781 --> 00:36:38.384]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:36:38.484 --> 00:36:42.127]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.

[00:37:04.295 --> 00:37:06.776]  Well, I'm Margaret Hall reporting for Infowars.com.
[00:37:06.816 --> 00:37:16.459]  We've seen the Black Lives Matter movement in the news lately, more so than ever the past week, in relation to the deaths of Philander Castile and Alton Sterling at the hands of police officers.
[00:37:16.899 --> 00:37:23.741]  Now, before we get into the specifics of police shootings and these deaths, I want to play you the president's response to these killings.
[00:37:23.921 --> 00:37:24.341]  Take a look.
[00:37:25.282 --> 00:37:32.644]  When incidents like this occur, there's a big chunk of
[00:37:33.786 --> 00:37:44.600]  Our fellow citizenry that feels as if because of the color of their skin they are not being treated the same.
[00:37:47.904 --> 00:37:48.424]  And that hurts.
[00:37:51.528 --> 00:37:52.590]  And that should trouble all of us.
[00:37:53.490 --> 00:38:01.334]  Now, unlike the liberal opportunistic freaks on the left and the neo-Nazis on the right, we actually care about all lives.
[00:38:01.394 --> 00:38:04.875]  We care about black people getting shot and killed unjustly in this country, of course.
[00:38:05.275 --> 00:38:09.077]  And I hate to see cases like this, but we heard our president use a very troubling narrative.
[00:38:09.397 --> 00:38:20.182]  He's race-baiting, he's inciting more violence by using the narrative that he is and making this a race issue, making this a one-sided problem and fueling the anger.
[00:38:20.222 --> 00:38:21.903]  Now, I want to take you to my second clip.
[00:38:22.503 --> 00:38:26.907]  It's of the Dallas shooting, this happening last night where five police officers were killed.
[00:38:27.287 --> 00:38:28.188]  Take a look at this footage.
[00:39:21.892 --> 00:39:28.738]  We saw that horrific footage where a sniper actually gunned down five police officers that were attending to a protest scene.
[00:39:29.238 --> 00:39:37.204]  And the troubling issue here is that we're seeing a push now for the federalization of all local police officers in this country.
[00:39:37.264 --> 00:39:38.926]  And I want to take you to my third clip.
[00:39:39.366 --> 00:39:40.707]  It's a clip of a local sheriff.
[00:39:40.747 --> 00:39:48.333]  He told Megyn Kelly that he thinks that federalization of the Chicago police is in order because they're causing a murder crisis.
[00:39:48.654 --> 00:39:50.035]  Take a listen to what he has to say.
[00:39:51.004 --> 00:39:58.187]  I'm trying to figure out why a state of emergency hasn't been declared in parts of the city of Chicago, why there's no curfew in place from 6 p.m.
[00:39:58.227 --> 00:39:58.967]  to 6 a.m.
[00:39:59.027 --> 00:40:02.169]  The first thing they need to do is stem the violence at nighttime.
[00:40:02.729 --> 00:40:07.471]  Somehow they have to stop the bleeding, but Rahm Emanuel seems incapable of doing this.
[00:40:07.571 --> 00:40:14.814]  I just need to know how many more black people have to be shot and killed, like Director Comey said, before somebody thinks that this is an emergency.
[00:40:15.945 --> 00:40:23.987]  Sheriff Clark isn't alone in calling for martial law in cities, which aligns with the narrative that we should federalize, nationalize our police force.
[00:40:24.167 --> 00:40:26.808]  Al Sharpton has the same sentiment.
[00:40:26.848 --> 00:40:27.928]  I brought his clip for you.
[00:40:28.328 --> 00:40:29.309]  Take a look at what he says.
[00:40:30.409 --> 00:40:36.210]  There must be national policy and national law on policing.
[00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:38.811]  We can't go from state to state.
[00:40:39.611 --> 00:40:42.572]  We've got to have national law to protect people.
[00:40:43.543 --> 00:40:46.499]  Against these continued...
[00:40:47.825 --> 00:40:48.065]  Question.
[00:40:48.785 --> 00:40:54.827]  We hear Al Sharpton akinning the national policing legislation to the Civil Rights Act.
[00:40:54.887 --> 00:40:58.187]  And he says there must be a national policy, a national law on policing.
[00:40:58.547 --> 00:40:59.868]  We can't go from state to state.
[00:40:59.888 --> 00:41:02.108]  We can't trust states with their own laws and regulations.
[00:41:02.388 --> 00:41:03.809]  We need to federalize this.
[00:41:03.949 --> 00:41:06.169]  We need to step this up and take control of it.
[00:41:06.209 --> 00:41:09.270]  Now, that's in line with what the president is trying to do.
[00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:13.071]  He's picked six cities to have nationalized police forces.
[00:41:13.171 --> 00:41:14.511]  This is his pilot program.
[00:41:15.171 --> 00:41:16.212]  Five million of U.S.
[00:41:16.252 --> 00:41:18.994]  taxpayer money has been used to do this.
[00:41:19.014 --> 00:41:24.858]  It was launched by Eric Holder so that the DOJ could bring police departments under federal control.
[00:41:25.458 --> 00:41:36.065]  Now the call to nationalize our police force and institute martial law in cities to protect citizens from their own police officers, that falls in line with hacked messages of the Black Lives Matter leader.
[00:41:37.086 --> 00:41:42.810]  These messages actually reveal that the administration has a plan for a summer of chaos and even martial law.
[00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:44.891]  I want to read you some of these hacked messages.
[00:41:45.551 --> 00:41:55.998]  And on Friday, June the 10th, someone hacked into the Twitter account of hashtag Black Lives Matter, the leader and former Baltimore mayoral candidate, DeRay McKesson.
[00:41:56.378 --> 00:42:10.847]  And this is what was leaked, according to this one document, this interaction where the attorney general, it's alleged that the attorney general is planning a summer of chaos to cause disruption of the conventions and ultimately institute martial law.
[00:42:11.187 --> 00:42:19.829]  Now this exchange of messages between DeRay McKesson and a lady named Johnetta Elzey, this is what the conversation included.
[00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:21.890]  JE, have you spoken with Ms.
[00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:26.511]  Lynch, Attorney General, recently about the plan for summer and fall leading up to the elections?
[00:42:26.951 --> 00:42:28.952]  To which he replies, we spoke two weeks ago.
[00:42:29.012 --> 00:42:37.434]  They want us to start really pushing how racist Trump is now instead of waiting so that others can start getting the protests ready to shut both conventions down.
[00:42:38.214 --> 00:42:39.596]  And the conversation continues.
[00:42:39.716 --> 00:42:47.164]  If we can get both conventions shut down for messing over Bernie and for having racist Trump, then get martial law declared so Obama can stay in office.
[00:42:47.184 --> 00:42:47.705]  We will win.
[00:42:48.085 --> 00:42:52.750]  Call you soon when I get to my dad's so I can have his landline and we can talk about this more.
[00:42:53.451 --> 00:43:00.613]  So the summer of chaos that they're speaking of, they go on to detail how they're busing people in to create riots.
[00:43:00.633 --> 00:43:06.995]  2,000 people bused in from different cities and another 6,000 to 8,000 expected to drive into Cleveland for the convention.
[00:43:07.015 --> 00:43:12.857]  They're hoping to cause such mass chaos that martial law has to be declared, possibly even not an election.
[00:43:12.917 --> 00:43:13.377]  Who knows?
[00:43:13.417 --> 00:43:20.459]  But at least Obama gets to stay in office according to these leaked tweets between the two of them regarding our own U.S.
[00:43:20.499 --> 00:43:22.080]  Attorney General, Loretta Lynch.
[00:43:22.801 --> 00:43:28.270]  This goes hand in hand with the nationalized police force pilot program that's being instituted currently.
[00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:32.557]  And if martial law is declared, we might not even see an election.
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:41.963]  Well, a federal system of policing would be a good idea, in theory, if we could just ignore all the problems and elements associated with federal law enforcement lately.
[00:43:42.003 --> 00:44:01.550]  That aside for a moment, what we know from these tweets, from this leaked information, is that mass chaos is planned all through the summer, centered around the election, right up until the election, and if they can manage to stop or halt it and declare this martial law as DHS has implemented the plan of nationalized police forces, they just might get away with it.
[00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:15.541]  Meanwhile, our president is making this a race issue, pointing out how police brutalized disproportionately black people, and this could be a front for pushing a nationalized police force and ultimately declaring martial law.
[00:44:15.561 --> 00:44:18.624]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:44:18.644 --> 00:44:30.914]  There's a big chunk of our fellow citizenry that feels as if
[00:44:33.795 --> 00:44:37.717]  Because of the color of their skin, they are not being treated the same.
[00:44:41.018 --> 00:44:41.519]  And that hurts.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.740]  And that should trouble all of us.
[00:44:47.321 --> 00:44:50.563]  Does it hurt as much as 52% of blacks being chopped up in the womb?
[00:44:51.943 --> 00:44:55.425]  Does it hurt as much as the government shipping the drugs into the community at the federal level?
[00:44:56.848 --> 00:44:58.869]  Does it hurt as much as the black unemployment doubling?
[00:44:59.129 --> 00:45:06.230]  Or the great society with LBJ, the guy you say is great, saying I'm going to have those inwards voting Democrat for the next hundred years.
[00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:08.671]  We're going to give them welfare and break up their families.
[00:45:09.431 --> 00:45:13.792]  Because the black communities, I'm not defending segregation, but what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, to quote Nishi.
[00:45:15.833 --> 00:45:21.474]  When my dad was a kid, the nicest areas of town that were big, there were rich areas that were white, but they were small.
[00:45:22.776 --> 00:45:26.057]  The nicest areas when they go into town were the black areas.
[00:45:27.057 --> 00:45:30.857]  Their own hotels, their own cleaners, their own restaurants, everybody wearing suits.
[00:45:35.558 --> 00:45:39.479]  All of it blown away in decades of weaponized media.
[00:45:39.719 --> 00:45:41.139]  And it's happened to everybody right now.
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:51.341]  In the 1920s and 30s and 40s, look it up, black households had lower illegitimacy than white households.
[00:45:53.359 --> 00:45:54.059]  Now it's upwards of 90%.
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:46:03.102]  And that's the same plan for... They beta tested it on the black Americans.
[00:46:07.084 --> 00:46:09.145]  And now it's being beta tested on everybody.
[00:46:09.845 --> 00:46:10.965]  And we better wake up to it.
[00:46:11.085 --> 00:46:13.066]  Obama is a known predator.
[00:46:15.147 --> 00:46:18.348]  He's the black face on the New World Order, as we said in the Obama deception.
[00:46:28.994 --> 00:46:35.378]  We also believe that these suspects have threatened to plant a bomb in the downtown area.
[00:46:36.599 --> 00:46:56.111]  We have reached out to our federal law enforcement partners, both the FBI and the ATF, to help us search for both these suspects, or maybe it's more, and to do a very thorough search of this area where we believe there might be a bomb planted.
[00:47:02.941 --> 00:47:04.782]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:47:04.843 --> 00:47:06.724]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:47:06.844 --> 00:47:09.646]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:47:09.766 --> 00:47:15.611]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:47:15.831 --> 00:47:24.718]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[00:47:25.018 --> 00:47:29.902]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children
[00:47:30.162 --> 00:47:30.362]  We're good.
[00:47:46.644 --> 00:47:53.433]  It's normally $220 plus, but right now for a limited time it's less than $200 at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:47:53.533 --> 00:47:56.097]  And the small profit we make goes to fund our reporters.
[00:47:56.237 --> 00:47:57.499]  This is a 360 win.
[00:47:57.719 --> 00:48:01.645]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:48:04.364 --> 00:48:07.766]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.147 --> 00:48:15.271]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:15.872 --> 00:48:24.217]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.498 --> 00:48:28.620]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:34.204]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:48:34.224 --> 00:48:34.864]  We're good.
[00:49:07.699 --> 00:49:10.982]  I'm here at a monument for Officer John Gaines.
[00:49:12.684 --> 00:49:18.329]  John Gaines was an African American police officer who was killed by a white police officer.
[00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:30.840]  And then, less than two years later, Tom Allen, the only black officer in Austin at that time, similar to John Gaines, was killed, this time by a black news editor.
[00:49:31.961 --> 00:49:34.603]  I'm Ashley Beckford for InfoWars.com.
[00:49:34.943 --> 00:49:42.467]  I'm here today on the streets of Austin to find out how people feel about the murders that occurred last night in Dallas.
[00:49:43.028 --> 00:49:46.069]  Hey, do you care to comment about the shooting last night in Dallas?
[00:49:46.089 --> 00:49:48.631]  We're just trying to get people's opinions on how they feel about it.
[00:49:48.991 --> 00:49:54.774]  The Constitution doesn't mention anything about multiple shooting weapons that can kill more than one person.
[00:49:54.814 --> 00:49:56.315]  They were talking about muskets, obviously.
[00:49:56.335 --> 00:50:00.998]  The NRA knows this, but they just stand by, basically, and twist words in the Constitution.
[00:50:01.653 --> 00:50:03.174]  Violence just begets more violence.
[00:50:04.335 --> 00:50:05.396]  They eat away at each other.
[00:50:05.416 --> 00:50:07.497]  It's just not smart.
[00:50:08.178 --> 00:50:11.340]  How do you feel about these cops losing their lives last night?
[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:15.143]  It was like 5 guys were killed and 11 were wounded.
[00:50:15.163 --> 00:50:16.464]  Yeah, is it up to 5 now?
[00:50:16.704 --> 00:50:17.805]  Yeah, it was 4 yesterday.
[00:50:17.825 --> 00:50:19.686]  5 were confirmed dead.
[00:50:19.726 --> 00:50:20.467]  Yeah, I don't know.
[00:50:20.487 --> 00:50:21.828]  I think it's terrible.
[00:50:21.968 --> 00:50:22.949]  And I think it's close to home.
[00:50:23.329 --> 00:50:24.410]  Yeah, definitely.
[00:50:25.049 --> 00:50:35.956]  I think the Black Lives Matter movement needs to work together with the police, and we need to come together to solve this problem we have with the justice system, and it needs to be fixed, definitely.
[00:50:36.277 --> 00:50:39.899]  Do you think that that's like retaliation for all the killing they've been doing?
[00:50:39.939 --> 00:50:40.480]  It could be.
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:41.160]  It could be.
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:41.921]  Yeah.
[00:50:42.141 --> 00:50:42.541]  It could be.
[00:50:42.941 --> 00:50:43.161]  Yeah.
[00:50:43.762 --> 00:50:44.002]  Yeah.
[00:50:44.262 --> 00:50:44.742]  It could be.
[00:50:45.083 --> 00:50:46.564]  Any other comments on it?
[00:50:47.404 --> 00:50:47.644]  No.
[00:50:47.825 --> 00:50:52.228]  Everybody needs to understand their role as law enforcement.
[00:50:52.488 --> 00:50:52.708]  Right.
[00:50:55.433 --> 00:50:59.317]  Shoot a person in the leg or something, make the person go down.
[00:50:59.397 --> 00:51:00.678]  Especially if he's butt naked.
[00:51:01.078 --> 00:51:03.320]  He ain't got no weapon, you know?
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:06.663]  He's just a young black man, strung out a little bit.
[00:51:07.484 --> 00:51:09.286]  But not for him to lose his life over.
[00:51:09.846 --> 00:51:10.827]  Cops are gang members.
[00:51:11.988 --> 00:51:15.271]  You got some gang members, but they legalize criminals.
[00:51:15.351 --> 00:51:16.833]  It irritates me too, a lot.
[00:51:17.594 --> 00:51:19.618]  Because these officers are not properly trained.
[00:51:20.038 --> 00:51:25.528]  I think how they resolved it was how they were responsible for what they did for the actions.
[00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:27.752]  I can't believe how they did it.
[00:51:27.792 --> 00:51:29.035]  How they did it was so...
[00:51:30.336 --> 00:51:33.077]  Like, it was, I don't know, it's like violent.
[00:51:33.277 --> 00:51:41.199]  But if they start holding them accountable, if they start holding them accountable for what they're doing, it wouldn't, you know, it wouldn't go so far.
[00:51:41.279 --> 00:51:47.902]  But they get away with it, they have a badge, and they, you know, their mental state is not right, it's hate, they got hate on their heart.
[00:51:48.082 --> 00:51:48.282]  Yeah.
[00:51:48.682 --> 00:51:55.724]  But now, I don't approve that, because it's not the guy that shot the boy, so why did you kill him long?
[00:51:56.104 --> 00:51:58.865]  I feel like it's not the proper response.
[00:51:59.775 --> 00:52:00.195]  You don't?
[00:52:00.636 --> 00:52:00.816]  No.
[00:52:01.276 --> 00:52:01.596]  Okay.
[00:52:01.676 --> 00:52:04.118]  I feel like that's still someone's family.
[00:52:04.478 --> 00:52:04.758]  Right.
[00:52:04.778 --> 00:52:10.342]  But then I feel like, you know, that's always someone's brother or family or father or someone's something.
[00:52:10.502 --> 00:52:11.383]  Yeah, that's true.
[00:52:11.463 --> 00:52:16.506]  And you never know what that person's personal, what their views weren't this other person's views and opinions.
[00:52:17.127 --> 00:52:20.709]  So I feel like you should never really just kill people.
[00:52:21.189 --> 00:52:22.350]  I really just don't like that idea.
[00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:23.631]  But I also feel like
[00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:30.432]  I'm sad about all the killings, whether it's a young black man getting killed or whether it's a police officer getting killed.
[00:52:46.667 --> 00:52:48.971]  You know, violence just begets more violence.
[00:52:49.351 --> 00:52:53.257]  And I think, you know, reinstituting the assault weapons ban would be a good thing.
[00:52:53.317 --> 00:52:54.479]  It would be a sensible thing.
[00:52:54.499 --> 00:52:56.302]  The NRA is going to fight it tooth and nail.
[00:52:57.028 --> 00:53:06.215]  But, you know, much in line with, you know, my friend here, I think it's, you know, really it's the fascists taking over and, you know, ruining it for everyone else.
[00:53:06.295 --> 00:53:17.163]  This guy who was, like, part of the military, and basically he was, like, trained, so he, I guess he's just tired of all these black men, you know, getting killed, like the guy in Austin, he was friggin' naked.
[00:53:17.183 --> 00:53:17.723]  Yeah.
[00:53:17.743 --> 00:53:19.225]  And they just shot him dead.
[00:53:19.285 --> 00:53:20.766]  Obviously he didn't have a weapon, so.
[00:53:20.986 --> 00:53:25.169]  I mean, it's one of those things where you're just kind of stuck.
[00:53:25.329 --> 00:53:25.669]  Yeah.
[00:53:27.577 --> 00:53:27.977]  Yeah!
[00:53:28.498 --> 00:53:32.560]  I want to shoot up some people because, you know, you did me wrong.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:33.460]  You hurt my people.
[00:53:33.881 --> 00:53:36.802]  You know, we're not getting any really where right now.
[00:53:36.822 --> 00:53:39.224]  Everyone's trying to cover things up and it's getting frustrating.
[00:53:39.264 --> 00:53:40.244]  It's making us angry.
[00:53:40.485 --> 00:53:40.745]  Right.
[00:53:41.065 --> 00:53:41.645]  But I don't know.
[00:53:42.045 --> 00:53:42.426]  Yeah.
[00:53:42.486 --> 00:53:44.007]  I feel like there should be some... I don't know.
[00:53:45.583 --> 00:53:46.524]  So there you have it.
[00:53:47.084 --> 00:53:55.352]  I've been out here on the streets of Austin, Texas to find out how people are reacting to the shooting that took place last night in Dallas.
[00:53:56.032 --> 00:53:58.074]  Five police officers have been killed.
[00:53:58.454 --> 00:54:06.181]  And unlike most people here, I believe not only do blue lives matter and black lives matter, but all lives matter.
[00:54:06.561 --> 00:54:09.444]  This is Ashley Beckford for InfoWars.com.
[00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:19.580]  Go!
[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:20.121]  Go!
[00:54:21.261 --> 00:54:21.561]  Go!
[00:54:21.622 --> 00:54:21.942]  Go!
[00:54:22.862 --> 00:54:23.142]  Go!
[00:54:23.202 --> 00:54:23.342]  Go!
[00:54:38.431 --> 00:54:39.272]  Oh my God!
[00:54:39.292 --> 00:54:39.992]  There's a gun!
[00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:25.111]  Some of these really aren't to the team.
[00:55:25.972 --> 00:55:35.419]  This is not one person with a... This is a person with a big neck.
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:37.761]  Is that a cop dead?
[00:55:39.622 --> 00:55:40.763]  Dude, that's a cop down!
[00:55:41.483 --> 00:55:43.665]  Dude, that's a cop down!
[00:55:45.091 --> 00:55:46.073]  There's four cops down.
[00:55:46.614 --> 00:55:47.015]  Four?
[00:55:47.296 --> 00:55:48.899]  Yeah, he shot five, seven times.
[00:55:48.999 --> 00:55:49.640]  It's a dude?
[00:55:49.941 --> 00:55:51.784]  No, it's a sniper from up here somewhere.
[00:55:52.005 --> 00:55:52.786]  It's a sniper?
[00:56:15.269 --> 00:56:29.416]  When incidents like this occur, there's a big chunk of our fellow citizenry that feels as if, because of the color of their skin, they are not being treated the same.
[00:56:29.996 --> 00:56:30.496]  And that hurts.
[00:56:45.111 --> 00:56:46.192]  That's it for tonight's news.
[00:56:46.252 --> 00:56:47.093]  Thank you for watching.
[00:56:47.473 --> 00:56:49.876]  Join us again on Monday at 7 central, 8 p.m.
[00:56:49.936 --> 00:56:52.098]  Eastern for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:56:57.003 --> 00:57:01.908]  As a community moves towards despotism, respect is restricted to fewer people.
[00:57:04.767 --> 00:57:13.452]  That's veteran Denver Police Officer Charles Jones IV smashing an unarmed suspect in the face six times.
[00:57:13.973 --> 00:57:18.295]  Officers accused of using excessive force on a suspect and then trying to erase the evidence.
[00:57:18.335 --> 00:57:20.977]  I'm observing what they're doing and they're all hitting me!
[00:57:20.997 --> 00:57:22.878]  I don't understand what's going on!
[00:57:22.898 --> 00:57:32.684]  A community rates low on an information scale when the press, radio, and other channels of communication are controlled by only a few people.
[00:57:33.507 --> 00:57:40.990]  Doesn't it raise ethical questions about the use of government money to produce stories about the government that wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were produced by the government?
[00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:42.531]  How can you ask such a question?
[00:57:42.551 --> 00:57:45.892]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:57:45.912 --> 00:57:52.836]  When a competent observer looks for signs of despotism in a community, he looks beyond fine words and noble phrases.
[00:57:52.856 --> 00:58:00.479]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.
[00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:03.652]  Tonight, I'm announcing those actions.
[00:58:03.852 --> 00:58:05.593]  What I say go, see?
[00:58:06.374 --> 00:58:07.835]  I'm the law around here!
[00:58:10.277 --> 00:58:13.099]  You came, you saw, you died.
[00:58:16.455 --> 00:58:23.958]  We just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:58:24.018 --> 00:58:31.401]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:58:31.441 --> 00:58:33.802]  We are trained to deceive if we have to.
[00:58:33.842 --> 00:58:35.322]  You really don't have to trust me.
[00:58:35.342 --> 00:58:36.123]  You shouldn't trust me.
[00:58:36.163 --> 00:58:39.664]  In fact, by my actually participating that, I will taint the news.
[00:58:40.244 --> 00:58:44.386]  In communities of this kind, despotism stands a good chance.
[00:58:45.406 --> 00:58:51.329]  Nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[00:58:51.369 --> 00:58:52.469]  Helping is you?
[00:58:52.489 --> 00:58:56.571]  Well, we're gonna do everything we can to help you.
[00:58:56.611 --> 00:59:00.053]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:59:00.633 --> 00:59:03.354]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:03.774 --> 00:59:05.155]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:59:05.415 --> 00:59:06.716]  You can't survive without it.
[00:59:06.896 --> 00:59:07.816]  But where do you get it?
[00:59:08.116 --> 00:59:13.839]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:59:14.099 --> 00:59:19.825]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:59:20.005 --> 00:59:36.882]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:59:37.262 --> 00:59:39.383]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
