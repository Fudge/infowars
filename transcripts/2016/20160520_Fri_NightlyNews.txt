[00:00:19.622 --> 00:00:21.504]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.544 --> 00:00:25.207]  It is Friday, May 20th, 2016 and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:25.407 --> 00:00:26.328]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:32.623 --> 00:00:38.887]  A lot of my fantasies actually revolve around little girls who are in some way more powerful than I am.
[00:00:39.348 --> 00:00:45.852]  Eventually my attraction became, you know, overwhelming to the point I had to go relieve myself in the bathroom.
[00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:03.045]  Where you at?
[00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:06.229]  Give me the job right now!
[00:01:06.309 --> 00:01:08.231]  Give me the job right now!
[00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:10.173]  I have a news furniture company.
[00:01:10.373 --> 00:01:13.035]  I create furniture refinishing jobs.
[00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:14.177]  I have movers.
[00:01:14.337 --> 00:01:16.199]  I have assistant movers.
[00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:18.801]  I have people that do work for me.
[00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:21.524]  Why are you trying to move furniture around?
[00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:16.755]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:18.575]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:19.976]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.376]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:26.697]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:30.558]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.759]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.139]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.300]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:02.537 --> 00:03:13.244]  Well, if any of you Second Amendment enthusiasts were wondering where Trump stands on the gun issue, the NRA made it pretty clear today after they endorsed Donald Trump for president.
[00:03:13.724 --> 00:03:18.508]  This was Chris Cox, the executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action.
[00:03:18.608 --> 00:03:21.830]  He made this endorsement today saying, now is the time to unite.
[00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.173]  If your preferred candidate dropped out of the race, it's time to get over it.
[00:03:26.953 --> 00:03:31.156]  And Donald Trump came out and said, you know what, the Second Amendment is under a threat like never before.
[00:03:31.636 --> 00:03:36.759]  And he called crooked Hillary Clinton the most anti-gun candidate ever to run for office.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.243]  And as he said before, she wants to abolish the Second Amendment and take your guns away.
[00:03:42.603 --> 00:03:49.265]  Which she has made incredibly clear time and time again, so you can bet that it is never Hillary.
[00:03:49.705 --> 00:03:58.368]  Now Trump has also come out in true Trumpian fashion, responding to Clinton's claims that he is not qualified to be president.
[00:03:58.928 --> 00:04:11.155]  So he said, the fact that Hillary thinks the temporary Muslim ban, which she calls the Muslim ban, promotes terrorism, proves Bernie Sanders was correct when he said that she is not qualified to be president.
[00:04:11.515 --> 00:04:20.701]  You can look at the carnage all over the world, including the World Trade Center, San Bernardino, Paris, the USS Cole, Brussels, and an unlimited number of other places.
[00:04:21.121 --> 00:04:26.864]  She and our totally ignorant president won't even use the term radical Islamic terrorism.
[00:04:27.425 --> 00:04:27.985]  And by the way,
[00:04:28.425 --> 00:04:30.786]  Ask Hillary, who blew up the plane last night?
[00:04:31.387 --> 00:04:33.608]  Another terrible but preventable tragedy.
[00:04:34.068 --> 00:04:36.189]  And so here again, this is what people love about Trump.
[00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:41.512]  He's not afraid to speak out, even though everyone's going to say, oh, he hates Muslims and he's not being politically correct.
[00:04:42.272 --> 00:04:42.913]  We get it.
[00:04:43.253 --> 00:04:45.354]  You're not allowed to speak out.
[00:04:45.434 --> 00:04:47.075]  Hashtag not all Muslims.
[00:04:47.635 --> 00:04:57.100]  And this is actually another astounding claim coming from the Eagles of Death Metal singer, who of course was at the Bataclan when it was attacked there in Paris.
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:08.206]  He is saying in a new interview that he actually saw with his own eyes in real time Muslims celebrating in the street during the attack.
[00:05:08.726 --> 00:05:14.169]  So he says as he stepped out of the building he saw them in the streets dancing, celebrating during the attack.
[00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.231]  He says there must have been some coordination.
[00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:18.112]  How did they know what was going on?
[00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:26.658]  He reminds everyone that a day after at the stadium, Muslims actually booed the moment of silence, and we barely heard about that in the press.
[00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:35.746]  And he also reiterated his claims that the Muslim security guards who were working at the Bataclan Theater on the night of the attack were complicit in the massacre.
[00:05:36.386 --> 00:05:41.951]  He points out how during the shooting, he went outside and the backstage door was propped open.
[00:05:42.351 --> 00:05:43.172]  How did that happen?
[00:05:43.872 --> 00:05:47.394]  And he also talks about two girls that he believes were involved.
[00:05:47.735 --> 00:05:50.557]  He said that they were at the venue, then they vanished before the shooting.
[00:05:51.137 --> 00:05:52.778]  They were in traditional Muslim garb.
[00:05:53.318 --> 00:05:56.200]  And, of course, they got caught a few days later.
[00:05:56.561 --> 00:06:03.425]  And all of this is really interesting because he was forced to apologize when he talked about his experience that night a few months ago.
[00:06:03.485 --> 00:06:07.148]  He was forced to apologize and say, you know, I was just having PTSD.
[00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:09.630]  How could I have known or made those claims?
[00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:17.336]  But now he's doubling down and saying this is what I experienced that night, this is exactly what I saw, and don't gaslight me bro!
[00:06:17.696 --> 00:06:25.963]  Well now French festivals have cancelled the Eagles of Death Metal over the remarks that he has made because you're not allowed
[00:06:26.443 --> 00:06:30.386]  You can't, you know, facts over feelings are, that's not the name of the game today.
[00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.628]  It's all about feelings over facts.
[00:06:33.028 --> 00:06:35.350]  And so they don't care about what your experience was.
[00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:40.874]  If you were actually there, actually present, actually on stage, could have possibly lost your life.
[00:06:41.295 --> 00:06:51.963]  And if you had, uh, you know, you're a musician and you set up before the show and you're having these experiences and you're witnessing all of this stuff that just doesn't add up, doesn't make sense, but you're not allowed to speak out.
[00:06:52.544 --> 00:06:53.664]  And in fact,
[00:06:54.855 --> 00:06:58.096]  Everyone needs to just use the hashtag, not all Muslims.
[00:06:58.136 --> 00:06:58.616]  But you know what?
[00:06:59.136 --> 00:07:00.717]  Here's a new hashtag for you.
[00:07:01.157 --> 00:07:04.038]  It's only Muslims that are blowing themselves up.
[00:07:04.418 --> 00:07:12.081]  Since 9-11, they're the only ones that are going out, strapping suicide vests to themselves, or bombs to planes, and blowing them up.
[00:07:12.461 --> 00:07:21.924]  So it's time for people to step back from the PC and stop correcting everybody's language and start getting with the facts and the reality that this is what is absolutely going on.
[00:07:22.445 --> 00:07:28.087]  And it's this policing of the English language that we really need to start talking about because it's getting scary.
[00:07:28.147 --> 00:07:31.888]  People are truly trying to rewrite words and rewrite science.
[00:07:32.328 --> 00:07:36.930]  And it's this Orwellian control people are finally starting to realize and fight back.
[00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:40.051]  That includes a Republican Senator, Tom Cotton,
[00:07:41.011 --> 00:07:45.677]  Who is now speaking out against this Orwellian control over words.
[00:07:46.177 --> 00:07:55.047]  And he's talking about the response the Obama administration has had to telling businesses that they can't call criminals felons.
[00:07:55.388 --> 00:07:59.072]  That now they have to call them justice-involved individuals.
[00:07:59.332 --> 00:08:00.533]  This is the DOJ.
[00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:06.538]  They've actually announced they're not going to call criminals felons anymore because it's too hard on them emotionally.
[00:08:06.939 --> 00:08:08.600]  So Tom Cotton speaks out.
[00:08:08.881 --> 00:08:13.625]  He mocks their decision, calling it a crime against the English language.
[00:08:13.885 --> 00:08:14.245]  And he said,
[00:08:15.086 --> 00:08:18.670]  It reflects the dangerous mindset that criminals are victims.
[00:08:18.971 --> 00:08:21.834]  That the justice system somehow happened to them.
[00:08:22.295 --> 00:08:23.376]  They didn't commit a crime.
[00:08:23.817 --> 00:08:26.700]  They became involved in the justice system.
[00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:30.024]  And he added again, criminals are not victims.
[00:08:30.444 --> 00:08:31.966]  Criminals are criminals.
[00:08:32.487 --> 00:08:33.628]  Victims are victims.
[00:08:34.689 --> 00:08:38.914]  Somebody better call the Thought Police, because I'm getting triggered there by those facts.
[00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:44.441]  Now, something else that, I mean, like, this is, I feel we are in an upside-down world.
[00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:47.384]  Friday the 13th, Backwards Day.
[00:08:47.404 --> 00:08:50.528]  The Charlotte Observer actually put out an editorial
[00:08:51.929 --> 00:08:59.252]  Making the case that girls need to overcome their discomfort of seeing male genitals in the locker room.
[00:08:59.612 --> 00:09:04.715]  They are assuming that the bathroom bill is going to eventually be repealed or declared illegal.
[00:09:05.315 --> 00:09:14.659]  And so they're saying that they need to get over this feeling of discomfort at the sight of male genitalia when transgender facilities are allowed in North Carolina.
[00:09:15.419 --> 00:09:17.420]  And the Washington Times reports that
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:22.042]  This is what the Obama administration nudged the rest of the country toward Friday.
[00:09:22.422 --> 00:09:32.846]  Yes, the thought of male genitalia in girls' locker rooms and vice versa might be distressing to some, but the battle for equality has always been, in part, about overcoming discomfort.
[00:09:33.206 --> 00:09:40.314]  With blacks sharing facilities, with gays sharing marriage, and then realizing it was not nearly so awful as some people imagined.
[00:09:40.675 --> 00:09:49.845]  So the fact that they're saying that it was nudged by the Obama administration is very hilarious considering they're now going to be arresting people and
[00:09:50.726 --> 00:09:52.146]  Punishing businesses and things like that.
[00:09:52.166 --> 00:09:53.667]  It's being forced down people's throats.
[00:09:54.187 --> 00:10:02.329]  Not to mention that it has nothing to do with race relations or even gay marriage because black people don't choose the color of their skin.
[00:10:02.429 --> 00:10:04.489]  Gay people do not choose to be gay.
[00:10:04.869 --> 00:10:08.630]  Where we've already now figured the science is settled on all of this.
[00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:14.611]  But now, here again, this is one thing that apparently scientists got wrong about two genders.
[00:10:15.111 --> 00:10:18.112]  But this is the monumental difference that they want people to make.
[00:10:18.792 --> 00:10:28.595]  And they also say in this article that the attacks that girls might suffer of a man entering the bathroom and saying, oh, you know, I need to be in here.
[00:10:28.895 --> 00:10:30.195]  The attacks will be rare.
[00:10:30.596 --> 00:10:31.616]  So, it's okay.
[00:10:31.976 --> 00:10:32.736]  It's totally okay.
[00:10:33.096 --> 00:10:38.418]  Another thing that they're trying to massage into our brains that it's okay is pedophilia.
[00:10:39.298 --> 00:10:56.183]  For whatever reason, Salon has once again pulled out their resident pedophile to make the claim that pedophilia is okay, it's an alternative sexual orientation, and this is a video now that's been posted on Salon's Facebook page.
[00:10:56.883 --> 00:10:58.483]  This is Todd Nickerson.
[00:10:58.523 --> 00:11:00.164]  Now, of course, he first came to
[00:11:01.084 --> 00:11:01.745]  We're good to go.
[00:11:22.165 --> 00:11:31.910]  And what does Salon do as he's explaining how he's having fantasies of this five-year-old girl and to the point where he had to go excuse himself, relieve himself in the bathroom.
[00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:33.611]  Disgusting.
[00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:49.242]  They show this romanticized, soft-lighting picture of a little girl dancing and twirling around so that you and I can understand what the eyes of a pedophile, how they're viewing your little five-year-old girl.
[00:11:49.322 --> 00:11:55.147]  I mean, this is absolutely infuriating that they're trying to normalize this and give this guy a platform
[00:11:55.948 --> 00:12:06.137]  By, you know, romanticizing this image of a little girl who this guy says, you know, he had to go and take care of himself in the bathroom because he's so freaking deranged.
[00:12:06.897 --> 00:12:10.640]  And they're trying to peddle this out as, you know, people just need to be more accepting.
[00:12:11.141 --> 00:12:19.008]  But Nickerson has previously admitted in the past that he would engage in sexual activity with a child.
[00:12:19.608 --> 00:12:22.310]  That he loved if she initiated it, okay?
[00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:27.233]  And this is the same guy that claimed that that five-year-old girl that he was babysitting once came on to him.
[00:12:27.633 --> 00:12:36.118]  So this guy is clearly, totally freaking sick and delusional, but they want you to just be accepting of it, be loving.
[00:12:36.158 --> 00:12:38.280]  It's an alternative sexual orientation.
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.901]  Hey, if you're opening up to that,
[00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:47.186]  You know, you should be open up to this too, and you better be open to it, because soon it's going to be forced down your throat, just like the rest of these laws.
[00:12:47.906 --> 00:12:51.769]  And again, we are totally in Wally World and completely screwed.
[00:12:52.049 --> 00:12:56.693]  And if you don't believe me, you know, or this or that, take a look at this video.
[00:12:57.293 --> 00:13:00.796]  There is an angry mob, once again, surrounding a Trump supporter.
[00:13:00.876 --> 00:13:06.700]  Thank goodness most of these kids are not old enough to vote right now, but you can see how they're totally programmed.
[00:13:07.841 --> 00:13:14.806]  Here, this girl is arguing with this Trump supporter, explaining what is Donald Trump going to do to create jobs?
[00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:20.650]  And of course, the woman does explain exactly how tariffs work, and she's not satisfied with that.
[00:13:20.731 --> 00:13:21.131]  Take a look.
[00:13:22.595 --> 00:13:34.584]  Wait, so Donald Trump promised you jobs?
[00:13:34.624 --> 00:13:35.385]  With what?
[00:13:35.425 --> 00:13:35.905]  With jobs?
[00:13:35.965 --> 00:13:38.708]  He said, if he becomes president, we'll have more jobs.
[00:13:38.868 --> 00:13:43.832]  He's going to bring jobs back from other countries because they pay them nothing.
[00:13:44.012 --> 00:13:44.592]  It's slave labor.
[00:13:44.612 --> 00:13:45.233]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:13:45.253 --> 00:13:47.074]  Before you elaborate on the jobs.
[00:13:47.115 --> 00:13:48.836]  No, before you elaborate on your jobs.
[00:13:49.096 --> 00:13:50.858]  How is he going to do it?
[00:13:50.938 --> 00:13:53.379]  He's got to put a tariff on them.
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:57.523]  He's telling you his plan, but do you know, is he able to go through with his plan?
[00:13:57.583 --> 00:14:00.205]  Yeah, it is a fact that tariffs do work.
[00:14:00.305 --> 00:14:07.450]  You know, this country, before the income tax, this country where there were no personal income taxes.
[00:14:08.572 --> 00:14:10.874]  There were only tariffs.
[00:14:11.295 --> 00:14:14.178]  And they paid... 1913 they did two things.
[00:14:14.238 --> 00:14:21.567]  They created the Federal Reserve and they created the personal income tax.
[00:14:21.627 --> 00:14:22.167]  So before that...
[00:14:23.909 --> 00:14:27.733]  Tariffs have always run this country.
[00:14:27.753 --> 00:14:32.258]  Now, you put 35% taxes on everything coming in from Mexico, and guess what?
[00:14:32.358 --> 00:14:35.822]  Companies are going to bring their jobs back here, rather than pay a 35% tariff.
[00:14:35.842 --> 00:14:36.723]  Well, that's their problem.
[00:14:36.743 --> 00:14:40.287]  But if we're giving them the jobs, what are they going to pay?
[00:14:45.832 --> 00:14:47.314]  You know what?
[00:14:48.275 --> 00:14:51.638]  What the Mexican people have to do is do exactly what we did.
[00:14:51.978 --> 00:14:55.161]  Rise up and have a race of revolution.
[00:14:55.201 --> 00:14:56.702]  They tried!
[00:14:57.002 --> 00:14:58.844]  You think they're sitting there with the chihuahuas?
[00:14:58.884 --> 00:15:00.606]  What the fuck do you think they're doing?
[00:15:00.806 --> 00:15:04.309]  They disarmed the Mexicans just like they disarmed the French.
[00:15:04.589 --> 00:15:05.850]  They disarmed the English.
[00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:08.092]  And the minute they disarm us, it's over for us.
[00:15:10.394 --> 00:15:14.076]  How are we going to rise if he becomes president?
[00:15:14.096 --> 00:15:17.858]  How is Donald Trump going to help me?
[00:15:17.918 --> 00:15:21.980]  How is he going to help me?
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.241]  Trump is not wasting money on that.
[00:15:24.481 --> 00:15:27.222]  The money I paid... Wait a second.
[00:15:27.262 --> 00:15:27.702]  No, it's not.
[00:15:28.002 --> 00:15:29.423]  I paid $200 for a ticket.
[00:15:36.706 --> 00:15:38.107]  Why would you pay $200?
[00:15:38.827 --> 00:15:42.768]  Everybody in there paid $200 a ticket.
[00:15:42.828 --> 00:15:44.108]  No, no, no.
[00:15:44.148 --> 00:15:50.930]  They know where the money's going to pay off Chris Christie's debt.
[00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.671]  Why can't Chris Christie pay off his own debt?
[00:15:54.071 --> 00:16:04.095]  And this is where it gets a little bit frustrating, because we're always saying, you know, engage these people, let them speak how they feel, and then, you know, bring them some facts and challenge their ideas a little bit.
[00:16:04.135 --> 00:16:11.437]  But here, this woman is actually bringing facts, explaining how tariffs work, explaining how Trump would bring jobs back to this country.
[00:16:11.797 --> 00:16:13.898]  That doesn't satisfy this person who clearly
[00:16:14.238 --> 00:16:16.240]  Just wants to argue for the sake of arguing.
[00:16:16.621 --> 00:16:20.965]  Well, this week marked the 50th anniversary of China's Cultural Revolution.
[00:16:21.025 --> 00:16:24.089]  It was a chaotic period of purging and punishment.
[00:16:24.469 --> 00:16:33.438]  It began May 16, 1966, and it lasted in different phases until the Communist Party chairman, Mao, died 10 years later.
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.242]  Now this was led in part by Mao's Red Guards.
[00:16:37.282 --> 00:16:41.985]  They were a paramilitary social movement of up to 10 million young people.
[00:16:42.025 --> 00:16:48.329]  These were middle schoolers and high schoolers who were torturing and killing their society's leaders.
[00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:59.117]  Many of them informed on their own parents as well as family members who they alleged were having counter-revolutionary thoughts and actions, even if they didn't really know what those terms meant.
[00:16:59.597 --> 00:17:04.981]  They destroyed ancient works of art, burned books and roamed around the country like stormtroopers.
[00:17:05.361 --> 00:17:11.365]  They were enforcing their ideology in very brutish ways in the name of revolution.
[00:17:11.825 --> 00:17:12.846]  Sort of sounds familiar.
[00:17:12.886 --> 00:17:15.087]  We're seeing a lot of that happening in the country today.
[00:17:15.107 --> 00:17:19.450]  Now, hundreds of thousands of people died, possibly up to a million and a half people.
[00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:22.652]  In fact, 36 million more were persecuted.
[00:17:23.073 --> 00:17:25.454]  Now, my guest today is Lily Tang Williams.
[00:17:25.634 --> 00:17:29.357]  She is a libertarian candidate running for Senate, and she grew up
[00:17:29.957 --> 00:17:32.338]  Under the Cultural Revolution, under Mao's regime.
[00:17:32.378 --> 00:17:37.280]  Lily, thank you so much for joining us today and of course for speaking out against what you experienced there.
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.262]  I wanted to get your point of view on something that happened yesterday.
[00:17:41.702 --> 00:17:47.065]  Google, they always do this doodle and they actually honored an activist.
[00:17:47.785 --> 00:17:52.030]  Who admired Mao, Marx, and Osama bin Laden.
[00:17:52.411 --> 00:18:03.203]  Now, she's a radical, of course, she did a lot of great things, but this is a woman who actively spoke out against these people who really wanted to destroy Western society.
[00:18:03.384 --> 00:18:04.185]  What do you think about that?
[00:18:05.054 --> 00:18:13.338]  I wish I had the opportunity to go face people personally, to tell them what my life was like during the Cultural Revolution.
[00:18:13.738 --> 00:18:18.661]  Because, you know, what they say, what they do today is just very similar to what happened to us.
[00:18:19.181 --> 00:18:20.782]  And really, we don't want to go there.
[00:18:20.942 --> 00:18:22.563]  It's a total nightmare.
[00:18:22.943 --> 00:18:24.284]  It's a total tyranny.
[00:18:24.664 --> 00:18:27.706]  Everybody was a slave, except a few on the top.
[00:18:28.266 --> 00:18:32.028]  And I wish I could have the opportunity to actually face her.
[00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:43.422]  Yeah, well that's something that we are trying to point out a lot of times is that these young people don't realize they're going to be used and then once their dirty work is done they're going to be spit out just like the machine.
[00:18:43.883 --> 00:18:52.426]  Now Lily, we're going to be right back with you because I want to find out just exactly what it was like living under Mao and how that sort of parallels with what's going on today.
[00:18:52.746 --> 00:18:53.286]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:04.906 --> 00:19:09.309]  There's a very important question that needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.091]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.773 --> 00:19:15.774]  And to look at that threat we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.435 --> 00:19:27.183]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type 1 civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.854 --> 00:19:39.220]  You could say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:50.126]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.345]  We're good to go.
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.386]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:31.934]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.418]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:46.732]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:47.934]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.454 --> 00:20:53.499]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription.
[00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:10.395]  Not just that chips are going to be on the pills and medicines themselves, but now you're going to have to give your blood, basically every time, a tiny prick, into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on in your body as well as your genes.
[00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.878]  In this short report we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.991]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:23.995]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Meet Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.934]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:04.097]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:17.542]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:19.763]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:21.424]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:30.126]  We do have that magic spark, but the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:46.631]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in BrainForce, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.

[00:23:04.929 --> 00:23:07.530]  Lily, thank you so much for joining us once again today.
[00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:10.350]  Now, you grew up during the Cultural Revolution.
[00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:17.892]  Your uncles were actually taken to the forest for re-education, and I just really admire you for speaking out about this.
[00:23:18.352 --> 00:23:24.833]  Obviously, you say there on your website that you hate to see the country you love becoming more like the country that you left.
[00:23:24.913 --> 00:23:27.794]  Explain to people what this was like living during this time.
[00:23:28.905 --> 00:23:38.650]  Well, I share my uncle's story and I'm trying to warn the college students today on campuses wanting to silence other people for their freedom of speech.
[00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.231]  You know, my uncle's generation was very sad.
[00:23:41.271 --> 00:23:47.635]  They were used by Chairman Mao to purge his political enemies during the Cultural Revolution.
[00:23:48.115 --> 00:23:58.060]  And once Mao used them and they become violent in the cities and schools were shutting down, then he said, time to go to the countryside to be re-educated by peasants.
[00:23:58.635 --> 00:24:03.219]  And the policy is that you can only keep the youngest one in the family to stay home.
[00:24:03.599 --> 00:24:08.224]  So my grandmother and I lost three sons just like overnight.
[00:24:08.244 --> 00:24:09.925]  They all had to go to the countryside.
[00:24:10.426 --> 00:24:13.208]  And that was like 10 years of suffering.
[00:24:13.548 --> 00:24:15.130]  So my uncle was 17.
[00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:16.831]  By the time he came home, he was 27.
[00:24:17.111 --> 00:24:19.514]  No high school diploma.
[00:24:19.914 --> 00:24:21.015]  Health was ruined.
[00:24:21.465 --> 00:24:25.187]  When they tried to come home, they were silenced too by the government.
[00:24:25.267 --> 00:24:33.811]  So they basically suffered the consequences of their own actions early years when they were young and naive and trusted the big government.
[00:24:34.552 --> 00:24:37.673]  And how did they come back during that time?
[00:24:37.973 --> 00:24:42.335]  They had to threat the government to say, let us come back to the cities now.
[00:24:42.636 --> 00:24:43.856]  We have suffered enough.
[00:24:44.356 --> 00:24:48.539]  Or we are going to kill ourselves on the railway tracks.
[00:24:48.999 --> 00:24:51.200]  They were planning a massive suicide.
[00:24:51.767 --> 00:25:00.094]  And with posters and blood, you know, on those posters on the walls to say, let us come home or all will kill ourselves.
[00:25:00.434 --> 00:25:06.179]  That's how they got the state government's attention in Sichuan and across other countries in the States too.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:15.867]  And so they eventually let them come home, but their parents had to retire earlier to basically give their jobs to their children.
[00:25:16.428 --> 00:25:20.031]  And that's how my three uncles eventually all come back.
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.885]  But it's just, you know, it's long years suffering.
[00:25:23.905 --> 00:25:24.726]  Think about 10, 12 years.
[00:25:26.874 --> 00:25:38.878]  Right, and so what do you think when you watch videos now, you see a lot of these young people out protesting Trump rallies and things like that, and they all seem to be parroting these same phrases that they're obviously learning in school.
[00:25:38.978 --> 00:25:54.323]  Everyone says the same thing, but whenever you ask them to explain themselves a little bit, they have no idea what they even mean when they're saying racist, homophobic, xenophobic, socialism, communism, it's so great, down with America and capitalism.
[00:25:54.723 --> 00:25:56.364]  They can't expand on those ideas.
[00:25:56.764 --> 00:26:00.405]  Yet they are fighting voraciously for them.
[00:26:00.725 --> 00:26:04.766]  So does that kind of ring any bells with what happened in the past?
[00:26:05.406 --> 00:26:11.287]  Well, of course, you know, you know, the audience offended me, made me feel really worried for our country.
[00:26:11.767 --> 00:26:18.368]  I saw a college student on campus of the University of Puerto Rico last fall wearing a Mao's t-shirt.
[00:26:18.768 --> 00:26:20.789]  I said, why are you wearing his t-shirt?
[00:26:20.989 --> 00:26:21.689]  Mao is cool.
[00:26:22.407 --> 00:26:23.870]  I said, Bao is cool.
[00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.613]  I said, I'm Chinese immigrant.
[00:26:25.774 --> 00:26:27.677]  I grew up under Mao's regime.
[00:26:28.238 --> 00:26:29.961]  And he is a mass murderer.
[00:26:30.729 --> 00:26:35.391]  And 50 to 80 millions of Chinese were killed.
[00:26:35.411 --> 00:26:39.033]  I mean, some were dying of massive starvation, some were murdered.
[00:26:39.513 --> 00:26:42.594]  I said, why do you adore somebody who's a mass murderer?
[00:26:42.975 --> 00:26:47.076]  It's like those kids, they just don't know what happened in history.
[00:26:47.517 --> 00:26:52.459]  And I don't blame them because our government schools don't teach our kids real history.
[00:26:52.998 --> 00:27:06.709]  You know, there are folks on other things that are doomed to be important leftist agendas, but our kids are not to be told to be true Americans who really treasure our constitutional rights and individual liberty.
[00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:09.692]  So I said, you know, we have freedom of speech.
[00:27:10.092 --> 00:27:14.816]  You know, why do you want to silence your professors and other people on your campuses?
[00:27:15.336 --> 00:27:20.901]  Because you call them racist or whatever, but they're saying though, someday that might happen to you.
[00:27:22.322 --> 00:27:25.963]  Tell them about the Cultural Revolution Red Guards' sad stories.
[00:27:26.323 --> 00:27:43.729]  You know, they were silenced, but then they were silencing other people under Mao's, you know, so-called revolutionary campaign, and criticized all their professors, all the intellectuals, and made them to wear pine cards every day to denounce them publicly.
[00:27:44.289 --> 00:27:49.331]  But then, when they wanted to tell the truth about their sufferings in the countryside, in the mountains,
[00:27:49.898 --> 00:27:50.919]  And they were silenced.
[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:55.564]  Some were sent to educational camp because they don't want to hear the truth from them.
[00:27:55.844 --> 00:27:59.829]  So my lesson to the college students today is that learn the history.
[00:28:00.229 --> 00:28:01.370]  Don't repeat it.
[00:28:01.631 --> 00:28:05.435]  I do not want to say cultural revolution on our college campuses today.
[00:28:05.796 --> 00:28:14.000]  The freedom of speech is precisely because you might not like or approve other people's speeches, but they have a right to do so.
[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:23.604]  You know, you don't have to like it, you don't have to approve it, but then when someday you have to say something other people don't like, and then you have a right to say so.
[00:28:23.644 --> 00:28:31.428]  So we have to defend each other's right to true freedom of speech, otherwise this country will go down the path of the communist China.
[00:28:32.403 --> 00:28:41.769]  Right, and Lily, now we know, like, the Red Guards, that they destroyed works of art, they burned books, got rid of the intellectuals that, you know, needed to be re-educated.
[00:28:42.169 --> 00:29:00.000]  So, let's look at today, how we're seeing them wanting to tear down statues because they're racist, or demanding that their professors be fired, or the deans of the schools have to excuse themselves because they are considered racist, or they're not bowing down to the pressures of these students
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:12.970]  Who are really saying that their feelings matter over anything else, and the only way you can protect their feelings is by not disagreeing with them and not having counter-revolutionary thoughts.
[00:29:14.671 --> 00:29:18.033]  Well, I think our college students are being really naive.
[00:29:18.334 --> 00:29:24.899]  They have a tendency to trust, you know, big, powerful government, and they have a tendency to believe that
[00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:29.750]  You know, like the leftist radical agenda, everything's racist.
[00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:34.032]  They're also extremely sensitive without rational thinking.
[00:29:34.452 --> 00:29:38.373]  You know, how about people's rights, the property rights?
[00:29:39.073 --> 00:29:42.234]  You can just tear down any statues that offend you.
[00:29:42.774 --> 00:29:50.181]  Or you can just, you know, criticize other organizations and business who, you know, don't do the things you like.
[00:29:50.381 --> 00:29:55.726]  Right, but it's also, they're also erasing a very important part of history.
[00:29:56.086 --> 00:30:02.852]  Yes, I know that it might cause you to be a little bit uncomfortable if you see statues up of people who may have owned slaves.
[00:30:03.332 --> 00:30:07.355]  At one time, but they also did some really great things for this country as well.
[00:30:07.695 --> 00:30:15.580]  So why not use that as something to remind people of where they came from, what their history was all about, rather than completely destroying it?
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:24.185]  Because if you have no idea of where you came from, then you have no idea of where you're going and where you're headed and you could be easily controlled and corralled.
[00:30:25.242 --> 00:30:26.082]  Right, I agree.
[00:30:26.122 --> 00:30:31.204]  During the Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards also destroyed churches and temples.
[00:30:31.704 --> 00:30:33.065]  I was raised as a Buddhist.
[00:30:33.245 --> 00:30:39.147]  I remember we could not go to our temples and pray as Buddhists and ask for blessings anymore.
[00:30:39.527 --> 00:30:48.170]  Because all those were politically incorrect, and they wanted to be only loyal to the Chairman Mao, to communism, to the Communist Party.
[00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:50.371]  So they shut down all the temples.
[00:30:50.691 --> 00:30:52.752]  Even Confucius' temples were shutting down.
[00:30:53.268 --> 00:31:05.051]  And my grandma's old, traditional sewing machine was confiscated because the Red Guards said, you've got to contribute to the country's greatest steel production campaign.
[00:31:05.591 --> 00:31:07.191]  And why do you keep this for yourself?
[00:31:07.231 --> 00:31:08.111]  You're so selfish.
[00:31:08.211 --> 00:31:10.392]  You need to contribute to the country.
[00:31:10.772 --> 00:31:13.632]  My grandma had to let her sewing machine go.
[00:31:13.672 --> 00:31:16.673]  That was the only thing valuable in her apartment.
[00:31:16.993 --> 00:31:20.674]  And she was so afraid that the Red Guards were going to find out about her past.
[00:31:21.124 --> 00:31:29.388]  When she was a second wife of a mountain outlaw group, she remarried to my stamp granddad later to kind of protect herself too.
[00:31:29.688 --> 00:31:31.489]  So she said, OK, you can take this.
[00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:35.731]  And she had to give that up, even though I knew how much she really treasured it.
[00:31:35.771 --> 00:31:37.332]  She used it to make clothes for us.
[00:31:37.752 --> 00:31:46.937]  So, you know, the young people today got to really learn about the individual rights instead of only focus on collectivism, public goods.
[00:31:46.957 --> 00:31:49.498]  Those are all communist socialist jargons.
[00:31:50.078 --> 00:31:52.219]  Lily, again, thank you so much for speaking out.
[00:31:52.259 --> 00:31:53.999]  Now, you are running for U.S.
[00:31:54.139 --> 00:31:54.459]  Senate.
[00:31:54.479 --> 00:31:57.540]  You say you were a slave once before, and you're not going to be one again.
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.880]  Tell people how they can support you and your run for Senate.
[00:32:01.481 --> 00:32:03.001]  Well, this is a grassroots campaign.
[00:32:03.061 --> 00:32:08.742]  I need you to follow me, support me, donate on my website, LilyForLiberty.com.
[00:32:09.142 --> 00:32:13.863]  I have a Facebook page, Lily For Liberty, and Twitter also, Lily For Liberty.
[00:32:14.223 --> 00:32:16.744]  And follow me and join my campaign for our
[00:32:17.604 --> 00:32:18.865]  Thank you, Lily.
[00:32:18.885 --> 00:32:19.085]  Thank you.
[00:33:02.338 --> 00:33:11.541]  A lot of people ask me what is the most important area of InfoWars that runs the whole operation that is having such a big effect against the globalists.
[00:33:12.341 --> 00:33:19.984]  And I've said it over and over again, it is you the listeners and the viewers that send us the intel, the news tips, that support the broadcast, that spread the word.
[00:33:20.884 --> 00:33:23.985]  You are 90% of the operation or more.
[00:33:24.025 --> 00:33:27.146]  You don't stand beside us, you stand at the heart of InfoWars.
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.
[00:33:57.342 --> 00:34:05.626]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, when products are sold out, you're unable to get them, sometimes for months, but we hold back the products for people that have already signed up for AutoShip.

[00:34:21.033 --> 00:34:28.437]  Listers have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products when you need them each month.
[00:34:29.474 --> 00:34:30.494]  Now it's finally here.
[00:34:30.954 --> 00:34:34.455]  AutoShip at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:34:34.775 --> 00:34:35.255]  It's easy.

[00:34:42.937 --> 00:34:49.699]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, it's a sure win.
[00:34:49.859 --> 00:34:53.400]  You add to that free shipping on orders of $50, it is a can't lose.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:04.968 --> 00:37:05.469]  Where you at?
[00:37:22.999 --> 00:37:27.301]  I have a used furniture refinishing job.
[00:37:27.401 --> 00:37:28.702]  I have movers.
[00:37:28.902 --> 00:37:29.983]  I have assistant movers.
[00:37:30.083 --> 00:37:33.645]  I have people that do work for me.
[00:37:33.705 --> 00:37:35.506]  But what are movers doing for us?
[00:37:35.526 --> 00:37:40.849]  So for him to come see her and see Deanna Turner, is she cutting the budget for education?
[00:37:40.869 --> 00:37:42.670]  No, I want to.
[00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:47.893]  This whole thing here is because of him being in debt.
[00:37:48.473 --> 00:37:48.753]  Yes.
[00:37:48.813 --> 00:37:48.993]  Why?
[00:37:49.033 --> 00:37:49.233]  Why?
[00:37:49.273 --> 00:37:49.473]  Why?
[00:37:49.493 --> 00:37:49.774]  Why?
[00:37:49.794 --> 00:37:49.934]  Why?
[00:37:49.954 --> 00:37:50.254]  Why?
[00:37:50.274 --> 00:37:50.394]  Why?
[00:37:50.434 --> 00:37:50.674]  Why?
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:13.822]  That's not right!
[00:38:14.002 --> 00:38:16.062]  You know why?
[00:38:16.142 --> 00:38:18.322]  I will tell you why.
[00:38:18.363 --> 00:38:22.383]  Because they made federal loans available to students.
[00:38:22.803 --> 00:38:25.204]  The colleges said, oh, there's that money.
[00:38:25.924 --> 00:38:30.665]  I went to college for four years, graduated from the University of Wisconsin.
[00:38:30.965 --> 00:38:31.885]  It cost my parents $12,000.
[00:38:34.446 --> 00:38:36.568]  How many years ago was that?
[00:38:36.688 --> 00:38:37.368]  A year!
[00:38:37.429 --> 00:38:38.690]  How many years ago was that?
[00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:39.670]  Congratulations!
[00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.951]  I owe $50,000!
[00:38:39.991 --> 00:38:43.473]  But that's still not right, that there's a lot of brands...
[00:38:50.479 --> 00:38:57.421]  Why are our elementary school teachers who are helping shape our future tomorrow being paid next to nothing?
[00:38:57.441 --> 00:38:59.321]  They have to pay a second and third job!
[00:38:59.341 --> 00:39:02.562]  You're talking about New Jersey before we talk about being here!
[00:39:02.602 --> 00:39:03.202]  No f***ing way!
[00:39:20.387 --> 00:39:25.289]  There are so many unemployed teachers.
[00:39:25.629 --> 00:39:27.330]  The wages have gone down.
[00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:28.811]  Simple supply and demand.
[00:39:28.871 --> 00:39:35.454]  Now, if you're a nuclear physicist, or you're a brain surgeon, like, who's the brain surgeon guy?
[00:39:37.415 --> 00:39:37.935]  Carson.
[00:39:38.075 --> 00:39:38.555]  Carson.
[00:39:38.955 --> 00:39:42.457]  I'll bet he makes a million and a half dollars a year.
[00:39:42.757 --> 00:39:43.918]  Because they're rare.
[00:39:53.623 --> 00:39:55.465]  I give back to my community.
[00:39:55.585 --> 00:39:56.325]  I do everything.
[00:39:56.345 --> 00:40:02.930]  I take care, and Chris Christie does not take care of the drug and alcohol epidemic that's going on in the state of New Jersey, okay?
[00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:10.056]  Whatever you're getting, whatever facilities, it all comes because of private insurance, which goes back to corporate greed, okay?
[00:40:10.316 --> 00:40:11.917]  What happens to the people that need help?
[00:40:12.217 --> 00:40:16.961]  You guys worry about the homeless people, but where are you guys giving their help to?
[00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:20.463]  Where's that money going back to these people that we can help today?
[00:40:21.877 --> 00:40:22.738]  Well, I will tell you this.
[00:40:22.838 --> 00:40:25.060]  Anybody who takes drugs is a stupid troll.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.223]  That's not right.
[00:40:27.303 --> 00:40:29.685]  I've never taken a drug a day of my life.
[00:40:30.366 --> 00:40:34.390]  Not too many people that use drugs are like my addicts.
[00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:37.733]  I've never had any type of drug addict.
[00:40:37.873 --> 00:40:41.257]  People take drugs the same way they drink alcohol.
[00:40:41.737 --> 00:40:43.179]  It's not really a big problem.
[00:40:43.839 --> 00:40:44.120]  It's not.
[00:40:46.161 --> 00:40:48.082]  I'm American.
[00:40:48.182 --> 00:40:52.524]  I was born right here in the United States.
[00:40:52.805 --> 00:40:54.886]  You have some English access with you.
[00:40:54.926 --> 00:40:55.446]  Yes, I do.
[00:41:01.949 --> 00:41:05.492]  She's completely ignoring what I have to say.
[00:41:05.532 --> 00:41:08.113]  Why is there a problem with the interaction?
[00:41:08.253 --> 00:41:09.554]  I think it's great.
[00:41:09.594 --> 00:41:10.355]  Really, yeah.
[00:41:10.375 --> 00:41:11.035]  No, I know.
[00:41:11.155 --> 00:41:11.696]  Yeah.
[00:41:11.716 --> 00:41:12.116]  Cheers.
[00:41:12.156 --> 00:41:12.837]  Cheers.
[00:41:12.977 --> 00:41:13.537]  Pip and all that.
[00:41:13.657 --> 00:41:17.860]  You gotta have money in order to help yourself as a drug addict.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:18.701]  You have to have money.
[00:41:18.721 --> 00:41:19.721]  You have to come for money.
[00:41:20.081 --> 00:41:20.342]  Okay?
[00:41:20.362 --> 00:41:23.063]  So why are there drugs you have to have money?
[00:41:23.083 --> 00:41:24.124]  How much are they?
[00:41:27.106 --> 00:41:28.608]  You're five dollars back!
[00:41:28.668 --> 00:41:31.410]  You're five dollars back, Harold!
[00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:31.790]  Harold!
[00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:32.451]  Five dollars!
[00:41:32.531 --> 00:41:33.472]  And Cole Ward!
[00:41:33.512 --> 00:41:34.412]  Love you guys!
[00:41:45.202 --> 00:41:47.124]  Wait, so Donald Trump promised you jobs?
[00:41:47.825 --> 00:41:48.586]  With what?
[00:41:48.626 --> 00:41:49.106]  With jobs?
[00:41:49.187 --> 00:41:51.710]  He said, if he becomes president, we'll have more jobs.
[00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:57.036]  He's going to bring jobs back from other countries because they pay them nothing.
[00:41:57.216 --> 00:41:57.897]  It's slave labor.
[00:41:57.917 --> 00:42:00.280]  No, no, no, no, before you elaborate on the jobs.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.062]  No, before you elaborate on your jobs.
[00:42:02.302 --> 00:42:04.084]  How is he going to do it?
[00:42:04.144 --> 00:42:06.587]  He's not putting a tariff on them!
[00:42:06.627 --> 00:42:10.632]  He's telling you his plan, but do you know, is he able to go through with his plan?
[00:42:10.652 --> 00:42:13.416]  Yeah, it is a fact that tariffs do work.
[00:42:13.516 --> 00:42:20.664]  You know, this country, before the income tax, this country where there were no personal income tax.
[00:42:20.704 --> 00:42:20.844]  None.
[00:42:21.765 --> 00:42:24.087]  There were only tariffs.
[00:42:24.487 --> 00:42:27.389]  And they paid... 1913 they did two things.
[00:42:27.449 --> 00:42:34.773]  They created the Federal Reserve and they created the personal income tax.
[00:42:34.833 --> 00:42:35.653]  So before that...
[00:42:37.114 --> 00:42:40.556]  Tariffs have always run this country.
[00:42:40.636 --> 00:42:45.698]  Now, you put 35% taxes on everything coming in from Mexico, and guess what?
[00:42:45.718 --> 00:42:49.759]  Companies are going to bring their jobs back here, rather than pay a 35% tariff.
[00:42:49.779 --> 00:42:50.640]  Well, that's their problem.
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:54.481]  But if we're giving them the jobs, what are they going to do?
[00:42:59.043 --> 00:43:00.965]  You know what?
[00:43:01.485 --> 00:43:04.827]  What the Mexican people have to do is do exactly what we did.
[00:43:04.887 --> 00:43:06.528]  Rise up and have a race of revolution.
[00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:14.731]  Okay, what's your name?
[00:43:15.191 --> 00:43:16.973]  Edward Fortune, the New Jersey weed man.
[00:43:17.574 --> 00:43:20.718]  I'm actually running for Congress this year, so I'm out here getting signatures.
[00:43:21.238 --> 00:43:23.661]  I'm a big, big advocate for jury nullification.
[00:43:23.701 --> 00:43:30.889]  If you look up, uh, on InfoWars, you look up jury nullification, you'll see I did a couple interviews in the past, you know, about jury nullification.
[00:43:30.909 --> 00:43:32.511]  So, what do you think about Donald Trump?
[00:43:33.404 --> 00:43:34.104]  F**k Donald Trump.
[00:43:51.352 --> 00:44:02.378]  TV reality show he's actually a great construction guy development guy, but he is not Presidential material and that's really what I think he's just not presidential material He's a hothead.
[00:44:02.398 --> 00:44:03.279]  He's a loose cannon.
[00:44:03.719 --> 00:44:06.180]  He he does things off the fly That's great.
[00:44:06.441 --> 00:44:10.203]  If you know you're you're talking about building a building, but you're talking about
[00:44:11.172 --> 00:44:11.632]  We're good to go.
[00:44:31.607 --> 00:44:42.093]  You know, I'm actually guilty of being very similar to him because I do things off the cuff and I do things at the moment and sometimes I go back and wish I had time to take that back or to do it a different way.
[00:44:42.553 --> 00:44:49.857]  But when you're talking about he has the power of the most powerful military in the world, he would be in control of
[00:44:50.617 --> 00:44:54.100]  The second or third largest economy in the world.
[00:44:54.661 --> 00:44:57.943]  You know, our currency system is the world's currency system.
[00:44:58.324 --> 00:45:01.446]  You can have this man in charge of all that.
[00:45:02.107 --> 00:45:04.809]  And give him the option to pick a Supreme Court Justice?
[00:45:05.049 --> 00:45:06.550]  Oh my God, no way!
[00:45:08.952 --> 00:45:14.837]  Alright, so if we're going to get specific, just specifically his policies, his ideas, what do you dislike the most?
[00:45:16.241 --> 00:45:17.102]  I think it's a divider.
[00:45:17.122 --> 00:45:20.344]  This is the United States of America.
[00:45:20.364 --> 00:45:29.290]  I admit, we're not quite as united as we should be, but putting Donald Trump in charge of America would be divisive.
[00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:31.912]  It would be dividing the United States.
[00:45:33.433 --> 00:45:35.975]  So you know the DNC is close by in Philly.
[00:45:38.379 --> 00:45:45.626]  I went to the Republican convention in 2000, and I didn't think I'd ever see a convention come to Philly again.
[00:45:46.027 --> 00:45:47.368]  So, this is great.
[00:45:47.849 --> 00:45:50.611]  It's a Democratic convention, and I think there's going to be a lot of turmoil.
[00:45:50.631 --> 00:45:54.255]  I am a burning for Bernie guy, you know?
[00:45:54.455 --> 00:45:58.340]  I believe in Bernie's message, and I'm sorry Hillary
[00:45:59.853 --> 00:46:00.574]  Lost me.
[00:46:01.376 --> 00:46:04.901]  Her adherence to Bill Clinton's 1995 crime bill, 1993 crime bill.
[00:46:09.551 --> 00:46:10.612]  You know, super predators.
[00:46:11.032 --> 00:46:16.797]  You know, we talk about Harry Angzinger, Richard Nixon, but you know what?
[00:46:17.137 --> 00:46:23.862]  The greatest increase in prison population actually occurred under Bill Clinton's watch.
[00:46:24.462 --> 00:46:25.864]  And she was down with it.
[00:46:26.604 --> 00:46:30.267]  She can't unsign her name or divorce herself from that political issue.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.901]  She never even divorced him.
[00:46:32.181 --> 00:46:35.362]  She can't divorce herself from his political policies, you know?
[00:46:35.623 --> 00:46:45.467]  And she is strapped to the 1993 crime bill, you know, where us so-called super predators were residing.
[00:46:47.488 --> 00:46:47.949]  Oh my God.
[00:46:47.969 --> 00:46:53.992]  I can go on and on and on about the war on drugs and how Bill Clinton's policies helped it.
[00:46:55.472 --> 00:46:56.193]  She's strapped to it.
[00:47:03.114 --> 00:47:07.477]  Get Brain Force at 25% off for a limited time at Infowarslife.com.
[00:47:07.597 --> 00:47:09.799]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.899 --> 00:47:16.724]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:16.944 --> 00:47:20.226]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.246 --> 00:47:21.407]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.991]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.

[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:35.299 --> 00:48:37.600]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:49:08.916 --> 00:49:12.859]  Alex Jones here with a quick note here on InfoWars Nightly News with Lee Ann McAdoo.
[00:49:13.199 --> 00:49:15.761]  George Clooney, one of the biggest fake liberal
[00:49:17.136 --> 00:49:18.997]  Con men of all time in my opinion.
[00:49:19.898 --> 00:49:29.125]  He is really panicked and so is his management team after a video shot last week by Paul Joseph Watson has more than 5 million views on Facebook and Twitter.
[00:49:29.986 --> 00:49:33.809]  The problem is he has all these bodyguards with guns but he wants us disarmed.
[00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:41.097]  Then he came out against Donald Trump saying Donald Trump hates Muslims and women when it's radical Muslims that are enslaving women.
[00:49:41.578 --> 00:49:48.045]  And this guy has giant hundred million dollar chateaus in Europe and hasn't invited one single refugee in.
[00:49:48.646 --> 00:49:50.448]  And now he's upset that the new media.
[00:49:51.340 --> 00:50:02.546]  Five million views pointing out that he is just so incredibly conceited and sits up there bumbling around, as you'll see at the start of this video, unable to talk without his notes.
[00:50:02.866 --> 00:50:03.426]  It's sickening.
[00:50:03.446 --> 00:50:07.328]  So we're going to show you this viral video that's got him so scared right now.
[00:50:07.368 --> 00:50:08.609]  But I want to tell George something quickly.
[00:50:08.969 --> 00:50:10.390]  George, you're not that bad.
[00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:11.971]  Bono, admittedly,
[00:50:12.771 --> 00:50:18.913]  We'll raise hundreds of millions of dollars and give 1.2% to charity while telling folks it's all going to charity.
[00:50:19.373 --> 00:50:21.653]  So, you don't get the award for the biggest scumbag.
[00:50:21.973 --> 00:50:26.115]  The Clinton Foundation keeps 50% of the money for the little black Haitian kids.
[00:50:26.515 --> 00:50:28.995]  So, we're just pointing out that you're trying to join this club.
[00:50:29.475 --> 00:50:30.176]  It's sickening.
[00:50:30.416 --> 00:50:31.036]  You're conceited.
[00:50:31.076 --> 00:50:31.656]  We don't like it.
[00:50:32.096 --> 00:50:34.997]  Now, I just barged in here on the Nightly News to tape this so we can air this tonight.
[00:50:35.277 --> 00:50:38.978]  Liam McAdoo, what's your view on George Clooney snickering right behind you there?
[00:50:39.378 --> 00:50:47.943]  Well, I think it's just amazing how the machine has been able to prop him up all of these years when you can look at his dismal numbers of any movie that he makes.
[00:50:48.003 --> 00:50:49.704]  I mean, nothing does well.
[00:50:50.405 --> 00:50:59.890]  When we were there at Amerageddon, they had actually been told that the theaters where Amerageddon was showing in was doing better than the George Clooney movie, showing in the same exact theaters.
[00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:07.775]  So here's a person who comes out and just wants to lecture everyone in America about what they need to be doing with their lives when he's so hypocritical
[00:51:08.276 --> 00:51:12.385]  And the fact that we point that out and it's gone viral.
[00:51:13.004 --> 00:51:14.224]  Of course he's shaking in his boots.
[00:51:14.764 --> 00:51:16.265]  The veil is kind of pulled aside.
[00:51:16.605 --> 00:51:17.865]  Yeah, Toto's done his job.
[00:51:17.905 --> 00:51:18.785]  That's a great point.
[00:51:19.286 --> 00:51:21.126]  How does he buy a hundred plus million dollars?
[00:51:21.166 --> 00:51:27.288]  This report's about to show Villa in Europe and like six or seven other big mansions, some of them $10 million, $20 million a piece.
[00:51:27.748 --> 00:51:32.869]  I mean, where's the money coming from when this guy can barely even get people into the box office?
[00:51:32.909 --> 00:51:34.329]  Well, enough about Clooney.
[00:51:34.649 --> 00:51:40.491]  We're going to go directly to Paul Joseph Watson's viral report titled F. George Clooney.
[00:51:42.173 --> 00:51:44.096]  There's not going to be a President Donald Trump.
[00:51:45.778 --> 00:51:46.679]  That's not going to happen.
[00:51:48.342 --> 00:51:50.965]  It's not going to happen because we're not going to be used.
[00:51:51.326 --> 00:51:54.811]  Fear is not going to be something that we're going to that's going to be.
[00:51:57.635 --> 00:52:08.850]  The worst thing about George Clooney isn't the unremitting bulls**t that streams out of his mouth.
[00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:12.295]  It's the way he always acts as if he's got the moral high ground.
[00:52:12.535 --> 00:52:14.716]  You don't have the moral high ground.
[00:52:14.836 --> 00:52:18.818]  You're supporting one of the most corrupt politicians in generations.
[00:52:18.978 --> 00:52:24.621]  You're supporting a woman who took a hundred million dollars from Gulf state dictators.
[00:52:24.761 --> 00:52:28.863]  Countries responsible for some of the worst human rights abuses on the planet.
[00:52:28.923 --> 00:52:32.105]  You're supporting a woman who's in bed with Saudi Arabia.
[00:52:32.285 --> 00:52:36.667]  A country that bankrolled ISIS, Al-Qaeda and was involved in 9-11.
[00:52:36.847 --> 00:52:40.589]  Trump is actually a result in many ways of the fact that
[00:52:41.389 --> 00:52:44.930]  Much of the news programs didn't follow up and ask tough questions.
[00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:45.690]  That's the truth.
[00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:46.170]  Really?
[00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:54.572]  So if Trump wasn't asked hard questions, why do studies show that he got the most negative coverage out of any Republican candidate?
[00:52:54.592 --> 00:52:58.952]  The ratings go up because they can show up empty podium saying Donald Trump is about to speak.
[00:52:59.593 --> 00:53:06.934]  You know, as opposed to taking those 30 seconds and saying, well, let's talk about refugees, which is the biggest crisis that's going on in the world right now.
[00:53:07.114 --> 00:53:09.995]  Okay George, let's talk about the refugees.
[00:53:10.115 --> 00:53:15.656]  Because it makes complete sense that you would throw your support behind Saudi Arabia's preferred candidate.
[00:53:15.696 --> 00:53:20.277]  You see, Clooney and the Saudis have a lot in common when it comes to refugees.
[00:53:20.377 --> 00:53:26.999]  They both whine and bitch about refugees all day long, while taking in precisely zero refugees.
[00:53:27.119 --> 00:53:36.301]  Saudi Arabia has 100,000 air-conditioned tents with bathroom and kitchen facilities that can house 3 million people.
[00:53:36.681 --> 00:53:39.144]  Sitting empty for most of the year.
[00:53:39.225 --> 00:53:41.828]  How many Syrian refugees have the Saudis taken in?
[00:53:42.389 --> 00:53:42.729]  None.
[00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:51.421]  George Clooney visits Angela Merkel to lecture Europe about how they're not doing enough for Muslim migrants, despite accepting millions of them over the past year.
[00:53:51.481 --> 00:53:54.044]  How many Syrian refugees has George Clooney taken in?
[00:53:54.725 --> 00:53:55.065]  Non.
[00:53:55.245 --> 00:53:55.766]  Zero.
[00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:56.486]  Nada.
[00:53:56.846 --> 00:53:57.347]  Zilch.
[00:53:57.707 --> 00:54:01.929]  The guy's got five frigging mansions, three of which are in Europe.
[00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:05.331]  He's just bought another one in Britain for ten million pounds.
[00:54:05.471 --> 00:54:14.337]  Clooney and his wife have got room for a new swimming pool, a home cinema, a library, a steam room, a spa, a gym, a wine cellar, and eight empty bedrooms.
[00:54:14.477 --> 00:54:16.618]  But no room for any refugees.
[00:54:16.798 --> 00:54:21.501]  So Clooney, when are you gonna do your bit for the refugees you care so deeply about?
[00:54:21.641 --> 00:54:26.003]  Or is this just one long tiresome exercise in virtue signaling?
[00:54:26.424 --> 00:54:27.644]  Mmm, I wonder!
[00:54:27.744 --> 00:54:36.369]  How dare you lecture Germans about accepting more refugees from the comfort of your 100 million dollar Lake Como villa?
[00:54:36.449 --> 00:54:45.494]  While people in villages like Sumtay with a population of little over a hundred are inundated by 750 unassimilated Muslim migrants.
[00:54:45.634 --> 00:54:50.417]  We've lost the ability to get to and tell the truth and get to the facts.
[00:54:50.697 --> 00:55:03.785]  Seriously, this is a guy who throws $350,000 a plate fundraisers for Hillary and then has the nerve to get on TV the next day to complain about getting big money out of politics.
[00:55:03.945 --> 00:55:11.630]  This is a guy who lectures Hollywood about diversity, yet whose new movie doesn't feature one single black actor.
[00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:13.512]  You make a lot of films yourself, yeah?
[00:55:13.552 --> 00:55:17.477]  I'd like to see you make a film before you get to talk about it!
[00:55:32.794 --> 00:55:34.855]  What a jerk, said Clooney.
[00:55:34.955 --> 00:55:43.318]  Well I'd like to see you listen to the parents of women and children raped by Muslim migrants in Europe before you get to talk about it.
[00:55:43.418 --> 00:55:57.883]  I'd like to see you house a single Syrian refugee in one of your numerous palatial mansions before implying that we're all racist for expressing concern about the millions of Muslim migrants pouring into Europe.
[00:55:58.103 --> 00:56:00.604]  George Clooney is a total prick.
[00:56:01.265 --> 00:56:02.405]  F*** George Clooney.
[00:56:03.442 --> 00:56:04.602]  Well, that's it for the show tonight.
[00:56:04.662 --> 00:56:08.704]  Thank you all so much for watching and we'll see you here again next week at 7 p.m.
[00:56:08.764 --> 00:56:09.124]  Central.
[00:56:15.127 --> 00:56:15.567]  Excuse me.
[00:56:15.887 --> 00:56:18.048]  We're asking people if they know their First Amendment rights.
[00:56:19.108 --> 00:56:20.309]  You know your First Amendment rights, bro?
[00:56:21.949 --> 00:56:22.270]  Okay.
[00:56:22.350 --> 00:56:23.830]  Well, I'm glad that he does know.
[00:56:25.011 --> 00:56:25.571]  Excuse me, sir.
[00:56:25.931 --> 00:56:28.032]  We're asking people if they can name their First Amendment rights.
[00:56:30.633 --> 00:56:31.673]  I guess not.
[00:56:31.713 --> 00:56:32.094]  Guess not.
[00:56:32.814 --> 00:56:33.134]  All right.
[00:56:34.212 --> 00:56:35.232]  There's an honest gentleman, though.
[00:56:36.593 --> 00:56:36.933]  Yeah.
[00:56:40.355 --> 00:56:41.936]  Passionate about her freedom of speech.
[00:56:42.376 --> 00:56:47.418]  Freedom of speech, religion, press, uh... You got some money, too.
[00:56:47.738 --> 00:56:49.459]  I'll go to you real quick.
[00:56:49.699 --> 00:56:55.122]  I think it's, like, to overthrow the- like, not overthrow the government, but, like, protest- Like, redress her grievances.
[00:56:55.962 --> 00:56:56.322]  Yeah.
[00:56:56.602 --> 00:56:58.523]  We're asking people if they know their First Amendment rights.
[00:57:00.484 --> 00:57:01.805]  The right to text, apparently.
[00:57:02.113 --> 00:57:04.474]  Hi, we're asking people if they can name their First Amendment rights.
[00:57:07.636 --> 00:57:08.577]  First Amendment rights, sir?
[00:57:09.217 --> 00:57:09.437]  Sir?
[00:57:10.178 --> 00:57:10.358]  No?
[00:57:10.918 --> 00:57:13.880]  Hello ladies, we're asking people if they can name their First Amendment rights.
[00:57:15.981 --> 00:57:16.201]  No?
[00:57:16.842 --> 00:57:26.087]  We've had so many people who have refused to comment, I guess they are trying to exercise their First Amendment right to free speech, or lack thereof, as some of the cases may be.
[00:57:26.107 --> 00:57:27.408]  Let's see what these people have to say.
[00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:29.420]  How you doing, guys?
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:31.701]  We're asking people if they can name their First Amendment rights.

[00:57:44.786 --> 00:57:45.326]  Freedom of the press.
[00:57:45.386 --> 00:57:45.767]  Oh, very good.
[00:57:46.127 --> 00:57:48.488]  We're gonna be sophomores next year in high school.

[00:58:07.119 --> 00:58:09.320]  That's all I know.
[00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:13.062]  Well, you know, most Americans don't even know religion is included, so you are ahead of the curve.
[00:58:13.082 --> 00:58:13.983]  Alright, good.
[00:58:14.123 --> 00:58:14.603]  Very good.

[00:58:33.739 --> 00:58:35.819]  I don't know what is First Amendment.

[00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:37.980]  Are you from... Where are you from?
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:39.000]  I'm from China.
[00:58:39.621 --> 00:58:44.722]  Uh, isn't that the, uh... So Second Amendment is freedom of speech.

[00:58:51.945 --> 00:58:52.405]  Who's the press?
