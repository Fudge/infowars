[00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:20.189]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:24.052]  Only 27 days out from the historic election we are in the final countdown.
[00:00:24.112 --> 00:00:28.776]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.821]  I talk about an information overload quickening.
[00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:50.121]  It has officially happened.
[00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:54.122]  Inbetweeninfowars.com and DrudgeReport.com alone.
[00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:57.482]  I was up till one in the morning researching last night.
[00:00:57.863 --> 00:00:59.283]  I got up at 6 a.m.
[00:01:00.343 --> 00:01:07.265]  Didn't even work out today so I could just focus on all that's coming out with WikiLeaks and my head is spinning.
[00:01:09.345 --> 00:01:10.685]  WikiLeaks has redeemed itself.
[00:01:10.765 --> 00:01:13.466]  They have released incredible information.
[00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:19.858]  And interestingly enough, Paul Watson is the guy up in the middle of the night every night churning this out.
[00:01:20.098 --> 00:01:33.647]  Out of the hundreds of huge pieces of news I have, the two top ones are emails that we first targeted and broke, which I'm very proud of Paul Watson.
[00:01:34.888 --> 00:01:36.730]  This latest data dump happened late last night.
[00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.910]  Paul's been on it all night long.
[00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:40.132]  Notice it's the top link on Drudge.
[00:01:43.137 --> 00:01:44.938]  Hates everyday Americans.
[00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:47.180]  That is in the email.
[00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.723]  We have it in her email that she hates everyday Americans.
[00:01:51.743 --> 00:01:52.503]  We already knew that.
[00:01:53.324 --> 00:01:58.768]  The better clingers that Obama talks about, the basement dwellers, the baristas that she talks about.
[00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.153]  And now, WikiLeaks bombshell, Hillary Clinton hates everyday Americans.
[00:02:08.973 --> 00:02:09.413]  Classic.
[00:02:10.154 --> 00:02:12.395]  We'll show TV viewers a document cam, if you can, right here.
[00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:14.676]  There is Hillary in her famous witch hat.
[00:02:15.737 --> 00:02:22.601]  And it really wasn't tongue-in-cheek yesterday when I said she's a literal demon, but I don't mean she physically came out of hell and isn't a human.
[00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:27.924]  I'm saying she acts like a demon-possessed creature, like Adolf Hitler.
[00:02:28.184 --> 00:02:29.905]  I mean, you know, these are evil, dark people.
[00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:30.706]  You can see it.
[00:02:31.086 --> 00:02:34.288]  You see it in their actions, but just the energy field around them.
[00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.299]  And the media's made a huge, big joke out of that.
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.340]  But everybody who's close to Hillary is horrified of her.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.920]  And the emails all show that.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.161]  She throws constant fits.
[00:02:43.441 --> 00:02:44.141]  She's vindictive.
[00:02:44.181 --> 00:02:44.781]  She's vicious.
[00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:46.381]  There's a trail of death behind her.
[00:02:47.702 --> 00:02:50.002]  And she, quote, hates everyday Americans.
[00:02:50.082 --> 00:02:51.462]  We're going to get into that in great detail.
[00:02:52.783 --> 00:03:01.984]  That article by Paul Joseph Watson with the WikiLeaks from April 2015, how much she hates Americans, is another one that broke last night.
[00:03:02.025 --> 00:03:03.785]  The Drudge Report had top story as well.
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.183]  Clinton campaign emails outlines effort to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[00:03:10.603 --> 00:03:12.104]  Now, I want to explain something to you folks.
[00:03:13.085 --> 00:03:13.845]  That is a quote.
[00:03:14.145 --> 00:03:18.868]  It actually says, we have an effort to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[00:03:18.888 --> 00:03:20.029]  Remember what Gruber said?
[00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:22.650]  Thank God they don't pay attention and are so stupid.
[00:03:26.253 --> 00:03:31.876]  These are the people that have filed the Clinton campaign two fake
[00:03:33.305 --> 00:03:35.727]  With fake names, not Jane Doe, but totally fake names.
[00:03:36.828 --> 00:03:42.893]  Trump raped me, suits, and now the same people with new Jane Doe names have filed another one.
[00:03:43.093 --> 00:03:49.398]  And the Trump campaign says, great, we hope we get served this time, because we're going to have sanctions on the people that bring this forward, the lawyers.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.740]  This is totally fake.
[00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:55.684]  And they're spamming it all over the New York Times, you name it, and they're calling it
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.281]  Trump bragging about sexual assaults.
[00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:03.583]  He said, no, these women come after you so hard, you could just grab them and they don't even get mad.
[00:04:04.023 --> 00:04:08.405]  It's a figure of speech saying there, I mean, you look at these videos, the women glomming on them.
[00:04:08.425 --> 00:04:11.927]  They're, they're just throwing themselves like it's Elvis Presley.
[00:04:13.208 --> 00:04:17.550]  You know, he first got big in the 1950s and women are just throwing themselves with the Beatles.
[00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.572]  I mean, I'm not some Mr. Superstar, but let me tell you.
[00:04:23.556 --> 00:04:24.737]  It's actually not fun.
[00:04:25.558 --> 00:04:35.188]  I'm a family person and it's craven out there because folks will then throw themselves at you and then later say that you're throwing yourself at them.
[00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:36.789]  It's a very, very dangerous road.
[00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.313]  It's what gets every great man in trouble in history generally.
[00:04:42.591 --> 00:04:46.414]  Comparing what Trump's done to this is just not even the same universe.
[00:04:47.135 --> 00:04:50.338]  Hillary's orders and orders and orders of magnitude worse.
[00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:56.564]  And the reason I keep plugging Drudge is, InfoWars and Drudge are the reason in Breitbart we're even knowing about these leaks.
[00:04:56.904 --> 00:05:02.849]  Hillary, it's come out in new articles, WikiLeaks crisis continues, has ordered the media not to cover it and most of them aren't.
[00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:06.953]  They're picking some little side issue and focusing on that to deceive their viewers.
[00:05:10.307 --> 00:05:22.495]  In the second presidential debate, Donald J. Trump came out and really called out Bill Clinton for his rapes, and how Hillary Clinton enabled him and helped cover it up, and also threatened people in the process.
[00:05:22.735 --> 00:05:25.677]  Now we have an article by Breitbart.com, exclusive video!
[00:05:25.897 --> 00:05:30.420]  Clinton's defenders, these are crimes terrified of enabler Hillary.
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:48.905]  In an exclusive video interview at the presidential suite of the historic Watergate Hotel, the victims of Bill Clinton's alleged sexual assault, Juanita Broderick, Kathleen Wiley, and Paula Jones, got together for the first time in person to express their personal fear of Hillary Clinton, and to warn voters that Clinton does not stand for women's issues.
[00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:51.406]  Something we've been saying since day one.
[00:05:51.526 --> 00:05:52.986]  She doesn't care about you women.
[00:05:53.126 --> 00:05:53.386]  Why?
[00:05:53.426 --> 00:05:54.546]  Because she's a pander.
[00:05:54.667 --> 00:05:55.747]  She gets rapists off.
[00:05:55.907 --> 00:05:57.047]  She lives with a rapist.
[00:05:57.107 --> 00:05:58.368]  She enables rapists.
[00:05:58.668 --> 00:05:59.828]  So, on November 8th,
[00:06:00.288 --> 00:06:06.534]  Make sure you get up off your couch and go and vote for the man who will make America great again.
[00:06:06.654 --> 00:06:09.737]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:06:10.018 --> 00:06:19.607]  Now we are introducing a new t-shirt, which I think folks need to get, telling the real truth about Bill Clinton, who is a serial rapist and a abuser of women.
[00:06:19.727 --> 00:06:23.529]  In another case, it's about groping and fondling and touching against a woman's will.
[00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:24.010]  And rape.
[00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.590]  And rape.
[00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.853]  Bill rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[00:06:28.913 --> 00:06:29.853]  He's a rapist.
[00:06:30.094 --> 00:06:30.534]  Absolutely.
[00:06:30.554 --> 00:06:31.134]  He's a public figure.
[00:06:31.154 --> 00:06:31.875]  He goes straight to hell.
[00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:37.018]  Get your Bill Clinton rape shirt today at InfoWarsTore.com or call 1-888-253-3139.

[00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.614]  And it was completely built from the ground up.
[00:07:12.814 --> 00:07:16.417]  We've seen example after example of cable news networks attempting to deceive you.
[00:07:16.657 --> 00:07:25.265]  In short, the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces who are trying to sway public opinion in an unnatural direction that only serves establishment agendas.
[00:07:25.505 --> 00:07:30.289]  But InfoWars Live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.

[00:08:00.451 --> 00:08:02.033]  Be stable.
[00:08:02.114 --> 00:08:06.180]  I got him for everybody!
[00:08:17.785 --> 00:08:20.788]  It's Tuesday, October 11th, 2016.
[00:08:21.729 --> 00:08:27.776]  We are now only 27 short days out from the most important election in modern history.
[00:08:29.057 --> 00:08:33.702]  An election that may decide the fate, not just of our republic, but the world.
[00:08:39.272 --> 00:08:41.153]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:41.634 --> 00:08:44.135]  Crashing for the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:44.776 --> 00:08:49.559]  I'm your host Alex Jones coming to you from deep in the heart of globalist occupied Texas.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.701]  Now under FEMA Region 6.
[00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:54.403]  The United Nations is now publicly
[00:08:55.083 --> 00:09:00.727]  Taking control of major police departments and local governments under Justice Department command.
[00:09:01.427 --> 00:09:03.148]  Open world government is being announced.
[00:09:03.548 --> 00:09:06.670]  The last vestiges of sovereignty are being swept away.
[00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:14.696]  Obama, this week, is ratifying, on his own, without Congress, the Global Carbon Tax Treaty.
[00:09:15.816 --> 00:09:16.737]  You say you can't do that?
[00:09:18.567 --> 00:09:19.248]  They are doing it.
[00:09:19.848 --> 00:09:29.255]  And the permanent bureaucracy and the regional FEMA governors, not just here but in every other state controlled has similar regional governors, are now in control.
[00:09:30.356 --> 00:09:34.897]  The UK discovered this in the last decade that they were being taken under the control of an unelected group.
[00:09:35.137 --> 00:09:39.719]  They have begun to pull out and economic terrorism is being used against them as we speak.
[00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:47.081]  Russia has begun to pull out in the last 20 years and has been under total economic and covert military attack.
[00:09:47.501 --> 00:09:53.543]  And now the United States is entering into the same position as we battle for the life of this republic.
[00:09:54.103 --> 00:09:57.544]  Make no mistake, the stakes could not be higher.
[00:09:59.352 --> 00:10:14.562]  And the globalists will call any nationalist, any patriot, a traitor to their country and claim that we're agents of some other foreign power when we're fighting a foreign globalist corporate combine that is dissolving the nation states as we speak.
[00:10:14.983 --> 00:10:15.683]  Okay, get ready.
[00:10:17.945 --> 00:10:21.127]  There is an information overload, as I said in the first segment if you missed it.
[00:10:22.475 --> 00:10:24.016]  My head is spinning at this point.
[00:10:24.516 --> 00:10:26.777]  It's been reported in Politico, Fox News, you name it.
[00:10:26.797 --> 00:10:40.945]  It's all linked up on InfoWars.com and DrugsReport.com has undoubtedly the best coverage and easiest to find across the board when it comes to the actual news videos and articles to see it for yourself and the WikiLeaks themselves.
[00:10:41.346 --> 00:10:46.669]  Armies of reporters pouring through them, our reporters and researchers and investigative journalists pouring through it.
[00:10:47.369 --> 00:10:50.491]  Paul Watson's already found just incredible information I'm going to get to in a moment.
[00:10:50.911 --> 00:10:57.274]  But first off, the White House is involved, so is Hillary campaign.
[00:10:57.634 --> 00:11:01.015]  They are publicly telling media, do not treat this as a foyer.
[00:11:01.955 --> 00:11:04.797]  Freedom of Information Act, do not treat this, no.
[00:11:05.237 --> 00:11:08.178]  And of course they ignore most of the foyers now, so now those people just go to hacking.
[00:11:08.478 --> 00:11:12.480]  This is illegal and they're implying it's criminal if you cover WikiLeaks.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.861]  This started 10 years ago when WikiLeaks first started leaking information.
[00:11:17.213 --> 00:11:19.676]  And they were saying, if you carry it, you know, you're going to be arrested.
[00:11:19.716 --> 00:11:21.558]  Well, folks in mass ignored them.
[00:11:21.739 --> 00:11:22.940]  And that's the essence of freedom.
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:31.090]  When you see something criminal, when you see globalists doing really bad things, and they're using national security to hide what they're doing, they must be exposed.
[00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.192]  That is our duty.
[00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:39.853]  So Wikileaks releases another 1,100 emails from John Podesta in third data dump in just five days.
[00:11:39.913 --> 00:11:40.173]  Good.
[00:11:40.673 --> 00:11:41.273]  And imagine.
[00:11:42.214 --> 00:11:43.754]  This strategy is incredible.
[00:11:43.774 --> 00:11:44.735]  27 days left.
[00:11:45.155 --> 00:11:50.417]  Now, the word is, Wikileaks is going to start hitting like water torture every day.
[00:11:50.557 --> 00:11:52.818]  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
[00:11:53.138 --> 00:11:54.299]  It is a feeding frenzy.
[00:11:54.739 --> 00:11:56.100]  And then right up to the election day,
[00:11:57.102 --> 00:11:58.282]  Ten data leaks!
[00:11:58.342 --> 00:12:00.943]  I mean, that's the pattern I'm seeing.
[00:12:01.664 --> 00:12:03.244]  It's an exponential growth curve.
[00:12:04.085 --> 00:12:07.186]  It shows Wikileaks has some really smart advisors.
[00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:13.608]  I've got to say, I kind of blew up last week, everybody being trolled, but I get the fact he wasn't trolling us, he was trolling the MSM.
[00:12:15.569 --> 00:12:18.530]  Now, continuing, here's two of the big ones right now.
[00:12:20.151 --> 00:12:21.251]  Wikileaks bombshell!
[00:12:21.271 --> 00:12:23.932]  Hillary Clinton hates everyday Americans, close quote.
[00:12:24.472 --> 00:12:26.093]  Campaign manager John Podesta
[00:12:27.651 --> 00:12:31.192]  In shocking admission, this is unbelievable.
[00:12:31.472 --> 00:12:33.132]  It's on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:12:33.473 --> 00:12:34.453]  This is the article.
[00:12:34.793 --> 00:12:37.233]  Send to everyone you know.
[00:12:37.434 --> 00:12:40.294]  This is what my crew needs to be focused on.
[00:12:40.334 --> 00:12:46.676]  I rarely give a directive, but I'm saying we need to focus obviously on WikiLeaks and we need to focus on the fact that
[00:12:47.742 --> 00:12:48.703]  We're better clingers.
[00:12:49.323 --> 00:12:50.804]  We're horrible baristas.
[00:12:50.844 --> 00:12:51.365]  What's wrong with that?
[00:12:51.405 --> 00:12:53.326]  That's a pretty high-paying, blue-collar job.
[00:12:53.366 --> 00:12:54.847]  I know baristas that make a hundred grand a year.
[00:12:55.168 --> 00:12:56.989]  They're good and charming at the right place.
[00:12:57.389 --> 00:12:58.210]  It's a hard job, too.
[00:12:59.551 --> 00:13:01.933]  The point is, is that it's insulting.
[00:13:02.994 --> 00:13:06.316]  All these folks that say you can't have cars, you can't have air conditioning, but they're on jumbo jets.
[00:13:06.697 --> 00:13:10.620]  These are the ultimate elitists that want to make you poor so they can disdain you.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.101]  They're the ultimate classist.
[00:13:13.956 --> 00:13:18.537]  And it goes on and ties into everything else she and Obama and others have said.
[00:13:18.557 --> 00:13:19.638]  These are nasty people.
[00:13:19.758 --> 00:13:24.319]  Real libertarians, real constitutionalists want to make you wealthy.
[00:13:24.919 --> 00:13:27.520]  We want to build a prosperous nation.
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.320]  That's what America was about.
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:33.822]  This isn't new elites keeping money and land away from the general public to control them.
[00:13:33.862 --> 00:13:34.722]  It's called feudalism.
[00:13:35.503 --> 00:13:43.608]  And it's been practiced by every culture from ancient Africa, to ancient Japan, to ancient China, to ancient Europe, to ancient Mesoamerica.
[00:13:43.668 --> 00:13:44.768]  It's the same thing.
[00:13:45.028 --> 00:13:51.752]  And every time you get a centralized class in, the renaissance that built the structure then starts unraveling.
[00:13:53.033 --> 00:13:54.093]  And then there's a long decline.
[00:13:54.133 --> 00:14:00.417]  I mean, when there were over 100,000 Aztec warriors, when a couple hundred of Cortez's men showed up, and they just killed them.
[00:14:01.707 --> 00:14:06.510]  It's because they were so decadent, so out of their minds, so completely out of control.
[00:14:07.351 --> 00:14:08.491]  And it's the same syndrome.
[00:14:09.352 --> 00:14:10.913]  WikiLeaks bombshell!
[00:14:10.973 --> 00:14:13.395]  Hillary Clinton hates everyday Americans.
[00:14:13.695 --> 00:14:16.016]  Campaign manager John Podesta in shocking admission.
[00:14:16.277 --> 00:14:17.938]  New WikiLeaks... Folks, I have hundreds of these.
[00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.599]  I don't know how I'm going to do this.
[00:14:19.659 --> 00:14:27.444]  The new WikiLeaks email released just moments ago includes a shocking admission by Clinton campaign manager John Podesta that Hillary Clinton has begun to hate everyday Americans.
[00:14:28.683 --> 00:14:29.003]  Wow.
[00:14:29.583 --> 00:14:30.684]  See, even their own people.
[00:14:30.984 --> 00:14:32.304]  We have Secret Service tell us this.
[00:14:32.664 --> 00:14:36.666]  High-level Democrats that have told me that they don't know why.
[00:14:36.686 --> 00:14:39.407]  I kind of made a joke about it, said she's a demon here, straight to the media, took it literal.
[00:14:39.727 --> 00:14:42.168]  I made the joke literal, like literally Hitler.
[00:14:42.868 --> 00:14:47.590]  And I said the word is she stinks, she's falling down all the time, she's meaner than ever, yelling, screaming.
[00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:55.633]  That's what two Secret Service agents say, and FBI agents say, and everybody, and the emails of everybody that knows her says this woman is psychotic.
[00:14:57.483 --> 00:15:05.429]  The whistleblower organization dumped part three of its Podesta email release today, and this has to be the most jaw-dropping revelation yet.
[00:15:05.529 --> 00:15:06.050]  Amen to that.
[00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:16.939]  The email sent by Podesta of just April last year contains a discussion of what talking points Hillary should use in framing her candidacy for president in order to get a good head start.
[00:15:17.419 --> 00:15:25.966]  I know she has begun to hate everyday Americans, but I think we should use it once the first time she says, I'm running for president, because you know everyday Americans need a champion.
[00:15:27.372 --> 00:15:28.633]  And it goes on from there.
[00:15:30.153 --> 00:15:31.254]  Just like Biden.
[00:15:32.154 --> 00:15:35.576]  As bad as he is, I don't think he's a literal, you know, psychopath.
[00:15:35.636 --> 00:15:36.396]  I mean, he's bad.
[00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:37.677]  He's just a mobster.
[00:15:39.437 --> 00:15:42.359]  When he's speaking on these battlegrounds, he goes, I know why you don't like Hillary.
[00:15:42.679 --> 00:15:43.079]  I get it.
[00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:43.439]  Okay.
[00:15:43.459 --> 00:15:45.780]  Cause everybody knows she stole it from Bernie Sanders.
[00:15:46.981 --> 00:15:47.941]  But go ahead and vote for her.
[00:15:48.181 --> 00:15:48.842]  She's better than Trump.
[00:15:50.001 --> 00:15:53.942]  What have I told you thousands of times the last year of this campaign season?
[00:15:54.562 --> 00:15:56.442]  Hillary doesn't want you to be prosperous.
[00:15:56.682 --> 00:15:57.682]  She hates you.
[00:15:59.643 --> 00:16:06.684]  Donald Trump loves average people and is an average in the street kind of guy.
[00:16:08.044 --> 00:16:10.285]  That's what everybody's told me behind the scenes for years.
[00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:11.925]  Give me the shirt off his back.
[00:16:13.345 --> 00:16:15.046]  If you mess with him, he'll turn on you very, very quickly.
[00:16:16.306 --> 00:16:16.626]  That's it.
[00:16:18.905 --> 00:16:20.465]  That's all that's going on with Trump.
[00:16:20.945 --> 00:16:22.606]  With Hillary, she doesn't give tips.
[00:16:22.826 --> 00:16:24.126]  She loves to get little people fired.
[00:16:24.666 --> 00:16:25.846]  She doesn't give Christmas presents.
[00:16:26.547 --> 00:16:28.147]  She treats everybody around her horribly.
[00:16:28.227 --> 00:16:34.288]  And that's the good Hillary, not the missile secrets to China and funding jihadis and all the weirdness.
[00:16:34.308 --> 00:16:35.248]  These are bad people.
[00:16:35.388 --> 00:16:36.589]  Now, this goes on from here.
[00:16:37.469 --> 00:16:38.089]  I've got to move quick.
[00:16:38.109 --> 00:16:38.789]  This is bombshell.
[00:16:38.829 --> 00:16:40.369]  It goes email after email in here.
[00:16:40.409 --> 00:16:42.670]  Just go read it for yourself how much she hates you and your family.
[00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:52.552]  You've got David Brock and the White House-run Media Matters and the Soros Fund of Media Matters attacking me every day, every day saying, Jones says Hillary hates you and your family.
[00:16:53.092 --> 00:16:54.993]  Jones says Hillary has it out to get you.
[00:16:55.313 --> 00:16:57.353]  Ha ha ha, look, I'm dead on!
[00:16:59.734 --> 00:17:01.594]  I've been covering this woman for 21 years.
[00:17:02.295 --> 00:17:09.417]  I've interviewed the state police, the mistresses, the rape victims.
[00:17:09.917 --> 00:17:11.137]  I know Hillary Clinton.
[00:17:12.659 --> 00:17:14.080]  Okay, let's continue.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.301]  Clinton campaign, now this is almost as big.
[00:17:17.941 --> 00:17:18.502]  It might be bigger.
[00:17:18.842 --> 00:17:25.685]  Clinton campaign email outlines effort to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry, just like they live.
[00:17:25.805 --> 00:17:27.585]  Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.
[00:17:27.825 --> 00:17:28.786]  Put you in a trance state.
[00:17:30.867 --> 00:17:37.890]  You think you're part of a winning team, even though Hillary wants to make you poor to control you and end the middle class for pure dominance.
[00:17:38.953 --> 00:17:44.538]  Clinton campaign email outlines effort to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry, and then it goes on.
[00:17:44.598 --> 00:17:53.346]  A Clinton campaign email released as part of the WikiLeaks data dump earlier today talks about the need to maintain political power by producing an unaware and compliant citizenry, close quote.
[00:17:53.726 --> 00:17:57.709]  Producing an unaware and compliant citizenry, close quote.
[00:17:59.551 --> 00:18:00.392]  What do we tell you every day?
[00:18:00.432 --> 00:18:02.694]  They want you unconscious, kind of halfway
[00:18:04.008 --> 00:18:09.289]  Thinking you're, you know, in charge, and your lady's gonna win, and yeah, we're trendy, and yeah, we're on the winning team.
[00:18:09.629 --> 00:18:10.889]  You're on the chump team.
[00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:20.511]  You're like somebody at Jim Jones' Guiana compound, drinking the grape Kool-Aid, or the cherry Kool-Aid, when it's full of cyanide.
[00:18:22.812 --> 00:18:25.512]  You're like people in cults giving their kids over to be sacrificed.
[00:18:25.892 --> 00:18:28.073]  I mean, you're under mind control.
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:34.163]  I don't have any illusions about Trump being perfect or some of the bad Republicans that are around him and the rest of it.
[00:18:34.183 --> 00:18:36.725]  But listen, he isn't out to get us, okay?
[00:18:38.086 --> 00:18:40.168]  That could be his campaign.
[00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.031]  Trump Pence, not out to get you.
[00:18:45.472 --> 00:18:46.213]  I mean, that's all.
[00:18:48.815 --> 00:18:51.317]  I've never heard of someone this evil about to be president.
[00:18:52.238 --> 00:18:52.558]  Just saying.
[00:18:53.953 --> 00:19:00.735]  The email was sent to Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, by former Clinton administration official, Bill Ivey, on March 13th, 2016.
[00:19:00.795 --> 00:19:01.655]  Folks, this is nothing new.
[00:19:02.075 --> 00:19:05.556]  I've read books by the current White House Science Czar, John P. Holdren.
[00:19:05.976 --> 00:19:07.636]  I've read books by Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[00:19:08.176 --> 00:19:11.397]  I've read books by Carol Quigley, the head of Georgetown Political Science.
[00:19:11.917 --> 00:19:17.359]  It was written for the State Department, where they say we want a compliant public basically in a trance.
[00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:22.140]  So, that's what we've got happening here.
[00:19:24.113 --> 00:19:34.661]  And it goes on to say, in the email, Ivey outlines the panic among some Democrats that Donald Trump's celebrity politics persona cannot be matched by Hillary's, who is not an entertainer, not a celebrity of the Trump-Kardashian mold.
[00:19:36.603 --> 00:19:48.132]  And then it just goes into, as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics in general, conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry, he writes.
[00:19:48.192 --> 00:19:48.372]  See?
[00:19:48.732 --> 00:19:53.496]  They've all conspired to distract you, divert you, as a permanent ruling class,
[00:19:54.847 --> 00:20:13.874]  That's why you see the State Department spokesperson, and that's why you see the lawyers for the White House on Charlie Rose, which is a quote, intellectual show on PBS, just for insiders and wannabe insiders to watch, where they celebrate and make fun of everybody and talk about how dumb the underclass is.
[00:20:15.315 --> 00:20:18.376]  And go, thank God they believed it when we said we could keep their doctor.
[00:20:21.257 --> 00:20:23.337]  In fact, we have a compilation of those videos.
[00:20:23.358 --> 00:20:24.318]  We can play them again if you like.
[00:20:25.228 --> 00:20:28.571]  Dude, I know you made a long, slick one, and so did McBrain, can I just have them raw?
[00:20:30.252 --> 00:20:37.878]  You know, Gibbs saying, I was told to tell the public there's no drone program, years after it publicly exists, ha ha ha, and Gruber saying, thank God the public doesn't pay attention, is dumb.
[00:20:38.899 --> 00:20:47.046]  And Charlie Rose, White House lawyers calling us dumb, and the State Department outgoing head saying, thank God we're so evil and horrible, ha ha ha.
[00:20:47.066 --> 00:20:48.167]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[00:20:48.467 --> 00:20:49.608]  This is what they do.
[00:20:49.808 --> 00:20:50.649]  I've been around them.
[00:20:51.781 --> 00:20:58.923]  I had the head of the Kissinger Group eight years ago, during breaks, saying, Alex, come to New York.
[00:20:59.103 --> 00:20:59.763]  Alex, come on.
[00:20:59.783 --> 00:21:00.424]  You're one of us.
[00:21:00.444 --> 00:21:04.185]  You can, you know, you're already the leader of people that question and are thinking.
[00:21:04.425 --> 00:21:05.545]  You're not one of the public.
[00:21:05.725 --> 00:21:06.565]  You can't help them.
[00:21:07.826 --> 00:21:08.366]  Come up here.
[00:21:09.206 --> 00:21:09.866]  And I'm like, no.
[00:21:10.607 --> 00:21:11.927]  And he's like, I can't believe this.
[00:21:11.947 --> 00:21:12.327]  Well, whatever.
[00:21:12.347 --> 00:21:13.348]  Then I'm not going to complete the interview.
[00:21:13.368 --> 00:21:14.208]  I go, don't be a coward.
[00:21:14.388 --> 00:21:15.028]  Do one more segment.
[00:21:15.268 --> 00:21:18.129]  John Herman, running the show right now, in my ear.
[00:21:19.129 --> 00:21:19.589]  He's the guy.
[00:21:19.609 --> 00:21:20.030]  He's been on the show.
[00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:20.610]  He's talking about it.
[00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:21.390]  Heard it all.
[00:21:22.654 --> 00:21:39.677]  He's heard top people at the Army and Navy joint, you know, strike laboratories from their war colleges come on during the breaks and be like, you'll never defeat our world, Governor Jones.
[00:21:39.897 --> 00:21:40.297]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:40.477 --> 00:21:42.518]  I mean, we really should record people during the breaks, but I don't do that.
[00:21:42.538 --> 00:21:44.598]  I'm so chivalrous, but they're so nasty.
[00:21:44.618 --> 00:21:47.719]  I mean, the stuff Harman's heard over the years is incredible.
[00:21:48.579 --> 00:21:51.580]  Behind the scenes, like, you'll never defeat us!
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.280]  Whoa!
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:58.363]  I mean, he's acting nice on the air, and during the break, it's like, to use the Star Wars analogy, where Senator Palpatine's all, Hi, everybody!
[00:21:58.743 --> 00:21:59.703]  I'm so sweet!
[00:21:59.783 --> 00:22:00.303]  Oh, yeah!
[00:22:00.564 --> 00:22:02.364]  Behind the scenes, you'll never beat us!
[00:22:02.404 --> 00:22:04.685]  The power of the world gather that is unstoppable!
[00:22:04.745 --> 00:22:06.026]  And you're like, whoa!
[00:22:07.206 --> 00:22:14.689]  I told you, uh, Gary Johnson was in here, I think it was earlier this year or last year, he was last at studio, and just acting like a lunatic!
[00:22:15.635 --> 00:22:26.666]  During the break, he's going... And you notice, if he doesn't like reporters now, he just goes... I don't care if the trolls take that out of context and make fun of me.
[00:22:26.706 --> 00:22:27.367]  Whatever, I don't care.
[00:22:27.527 --> 00:22:28.208]  That makes us bigger.
[00:22:28.928 --> 00:22:30.170]  People say, oh, who's this clown?
[00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:31.131]  Then they come find the real show.
[00:22:31.371 --> 00:22:33.012]  I'm showing you what Gary Johnson was doing during the break.
[00:22:33.032 --> 00:22:33.993]  I said, well, it was good to see you.
[00:22:34.013 --> 00:22:39.299]  He's like... Like, like, like, like, like he was a Muppet out of the Dark Crystal.
[00:22:41.035 --> 00:22:44.521]  I mean, I don't know, it's like they're possessed by space aliens or something, man.
[00:22:44.581 --> 00:22:47.446]  I don't mean that literally, but they don't act like humans.
[00:22:47.967 --> 00:22:48.428]  Hillary...
[00:22:51.277 --> 00:22:52.078]  Gary Johnson?
[00:22:52.138 --> 00:22:57.842]  I mean, I've been around it enough where they'll be acting totally normal and totally nice, and then just snap.
[00:22:57.862 --> 00:23:04.246]  I mean, I'll build up and get mad sometimes, but they'll just have this little fake face on and just instantly go from zero to a hundred, flipping out.
[00:23:04.586 --> 00:23:04.967]  I'm sorry.
[00:23:05.547 --> 00:23:06.448]  I've only hit two of the stories.
[00:23:06.568 --> 00:23:07.889]  I'm sorry, but how am I supposed to do this?
[00:23:08.269 --> 00:23:13.693]  I have probably, I'm not going to exaggerate, this is probably 300 articles today, hundreds of leaks.
[00:23:14.193 --> 00:23:15.754]  I don't even know what to say at this point, okay?
[00:23:16.975 --> 00:23:19.697]  Yes, he was doing that to me in the studio, what we have on screen.
[00:23:21.294 --> 00:23:25.116]  Just total disdain, total delusion, I'm in charge, I'm a god.
[00:23:25.516 --> 00:23:29.259]  Everybody I've run into that's super arrogant and thinks they're a god is actually a mental midget.
[00:23:29.539 --> 00:23:31.500]  And the Bible talks about a great delusion, that's what it is.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.542]  These people are already tuned into a virtual reality or something.
[00:23:35.282 --> 00:23:38.924]  I don't know what planet they come from, but man, it isn't Earth.
[00:23:41.366 --> 00:23:44.607]  And I mean that as a parable, not literal, New York Times.
[00:23:45.468 --> 00:23:45.988]  So, here we go.
[00:23:46.228 --> 00:23:50.551]  Clinton campaign email outlines effort to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[00:23:52.028 --> 00:23:54.590]  By the way, some of these emails came out two days ago, more came out today.
[00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:55.270]  We already knew this.
[00:23:55.291 --> 00:23:56.732]  He's already been caught lying to Congress a bunch.
[00:23:57.172 --> 00:24:07.920]  But the reason he said, indictable, is, and I've got that in the stack, is it's clearly Chelsea, who they're calling a brat, but she's the one going, this is illegal.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.343]  I'm the head of this, and I have people, I'm paid six million dollars a year.
[00:24:12.722 --> 00:24:21.085]  I have people telling me, give me access on this $9 billion lawsuit, you know, out of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and make this call and shut down this lawsuit.
[00:24:21.466 --> 00:24:23.987]  And they're openly telling me, hey, I gave millions of dollars.
[00:24:24.247 --> 00:24:25.467]  You're supposed to do this, Chelsea.
[00:24:25.787 --> 00:24:27.228]  You know, Bill Clinton told me so.
[00:24:28.328 --> 00:24:29.869]  And she's like, I don't want to go to jail.
[00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:31.370]  We have all the emails.
[00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:32.690]  I was reading them this morning.
[00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.011]  It's total overload.
[00:24:35.631 --> 00:24:36.092]  And guess what?
[00:24:36.112 --> 00:24:37.152]  They got those deals they wanted.
[00:24:39.215 --> 00:24:44.780]  They're like, Chelsea's gonna make our staff members commit suicide because she's a spoiled brat who's doing her job.
[00:24:45.942 --> 00:24:48.344]  No, Chelsea's actually has some soul, I think.
[00:24:49.425 --> 00:24:52.047]  She's in the earlier emails, you know, saying, I'm really worried.
[00:24:52.067 --> 00:24:53.869]  You know, these kids are dying of cholera.
[00:24:53.929 --> 00:24:54.890]  We're taking all the money.
[00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:56.532]  Dad, Mom, what the hell?
[00:24:57.653 --> 00:24:59.815]  Now, you're still living in a $10 million penthouse.
[00:25:00.756 --> 00:25:01.937]  You should leave your evil family.
[00:25:01.957 --> 00:25:02.758]  You should expose them.
[00:25:05.265 --> 00:25:08.166]  There's another Darth Vader analogy, but I'm not going to use it as a secret service to show him.
[00:25:08.526 --> 00:25:17.470]  I don't think she should literally throw them down the reactor shaft, but if you want to get reprieved, you need to politically throw your parents down the reactor shaft.
[00:25:19.571 --> 00:25:20.651]  There's still time, Chelsea!
[00:25:20.931 --> 00:25:22.892]  You know, Webster Hubble isn't as evil as Bill.
[00:25:23.192 --> 00:25:24.373]  You ought to be proud he's not your daddy.
[00:25:26.926 --> 00:25:27.587]  And then it goes on.
[00:25:27.607 --> 00:25:30.609]  There's other staffers going, we're really hurting people.
[00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:31.510]  Why are we doing this?
[00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:32.190]  Shut up.
[00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.692]  I mean, it goes on and on and on and on.
[00:25:34.892 --> 00:25:38.355]  Hillary blowing up, Hillary flipping out, and Hillary calling everyone scum.
[00:25:41.177 --> 00:25:50.004]  But meanwhile, as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics, and in general, conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[00:25:52.026 --> 00:25:52.987]  Unaware and compliant.
[00:25:53.207 --> 00:25:54.148]  That's the name of the game.
[00:25:56.338 --> 00:25:59.941]  The unawareness remains strong, but compliance is obviously fading rapidly.
[00:26:00.322 --> 00:26:07.287]  This problem demands some serious, strong thinking, and not just poll-driven, demographically inspired messaging.
[00:26:07.648 --> 00:26:08.849]  That means race war.
[00:26:09.449 --> 00:26:19.458]  That's what's in all the latest emails from Soros, says, our plan is to bring in uncompatible groups, cause disturbances, and then bring in a strong central government to deal with the problem.
[00:26:21.274 --> 00:26:24.516]  And in the same accent, Brzezinski is, I concur with your analysis.
[00:26:24.776 --> 00:26:25.676]  Launch operations.
[00:26:26.797 --> 00:26:27.757]  10 billion per year.
[00:26:28.217 --> 00:26:30.378]  Per annum, 100 billion per decade.
[00:26:30.618 --> 00:26:31.399]  Launch operations.
[00:26:31.959 --> 00:26:33.420]  Operation Chaos Directive.
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.281]  I mean, this is beyond a James Bond movie.
[00:26:35.501 --> 00:26:37.382]  They all have James Bond villain voices.
[00:26:37.722 --> 00:26:39.322]  They all have James Bond villain past.
[00:26:40.103 --> 00:26:43.124]  The new James Bond villain that runs Spectre is the Quantum Group?
[00:26:43.404 --> 00:26:46.506]  That's the literal name of his criminal organization.
[00:26:49.915 --> 00:26:56.538]  And I was told by a former high-level CIA person, a retiree, who won't come on the show anymore, he just says humanity's lost and won't come on.
[00:26:59.079 --> 00:27:08.684]  He told me 50 years ago, because his dad had been high-level CIA, that Spectre was real and that the symbol is a Hydra.
[00:27:09.004 --> 00:27:11.225]  See, that's art imitating life, folks, not the other way around.
[00:27:11.705 --> 00:27:15.847]  And I'm just, we're sitting here with Hydra running things, trying to start a war with Russia.
[00:27:16.148 --> 00:27:18.769]  Hydra's got operatives in Russia too, folks, don't think for a minute.
[00:27:19.517 --> 00:27:20.559]  Playing us off against each other.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.482]  That's what the Rothschilds have always done.
[00:27:23.516 --> 00:27:26.158]  And we're living in a real-life comic book nightmare, Armageddon.
[00:27:26.458 --> 00:27:29.221]  You know, the new comic book by Marvel, Armageddon!
[00:27:29.761 --> 00:27:33.564]  You know, the powerful Lord Soros prepares for global race war and nuclear war.
[00:27:33.884 --> 00:27:35.386]  Meanwhile, the public watches football.
[00:27:35.466 --> 00:27:37.687]  I mean, I don't need to read comic books, folks.
[00:27:37.808 --> 00:27:38.628]  We're in it.
[00:27:39.429 --> 00:27:40.710]  And we have all the proof.
[00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:47.155]  Our operational directive to keep them in a trans state has been holding, but we're beginning to lose the control.
[00:27:47.295 --> 00:27:48.997]  They're coming out of the trans, Your Lordship.
[00:27:49.377 --> 00:27:51.419]  We must launch demographic operations immediately.
[00:27:52.219 --> 00:27:53.442]  I concur with your analysis.
[00:27:53.462 --> 00:27:55.044]  I mean, it's here!
[00:27:55.465 --> 00:27:56.767]  James Bond meetings!
[00:27:59.924 --> 00:28:00.604]  Hundreds of them!
[00:28:00.685 --> 00:28:02.225]  All concurring with everything!
[00:28:02.325 --> 00:28:03.586]  And you see them on the news!
[00:28:03.826 --> 00:28:04.627]  You see it beaming!
[00:28:04.987 --> 00:28:10.870]  There's been, like, 50 movies about black people being tortured and killed by evil white people the last four or five years.
[00:28:11.611 --> 00:28:14.953]  Sometimes I go to the movie theater trying to see a movie and, like, two of the movies are race war movies!
[00:28:15.313 --> 00:28:19.055]  Two of the movies are white people doing evil things to black people to conjure up a race war!
[00:28:19.395 --> 00:28:23.458]  I mean, Hollywood has been ordered, this is the season, launch it!
[00:28:25.099 --> 00:28:25.619]  And here it is!
[00:28:27.287 --> 00:28:28.108]  We can't hold them.
[00:28:28.128 --> 00:28:29.148]  The trance has fallen.
[00:28:29.168 --> 00:28:30.369]  They're going to find out about our plan.
[00:28:31.229 --> 00:28:32.911]  Their plan is fluoride in the water.
[00:28:33.491 --> 00:28:50.321]  John P. Holdren wrote in 1974, the year I was born, for eco-science, for the major global combines of UNESCO, that we are going to put additives in the water to calm and make the public servile.
[00:28:51.522 --> 00:28:52.062]  Servile!
[00:28:53.043 --> 00:28:54.424]  Ser-vile!
[00:28:56.112 --> 00:28:56.873]  Okay, I've hit two.
[00:28:57.213 --> 00:28:59.916]  I literally have 290-something left.
[00:29:00.977 --> 00:29:01.858]  It just goes on and on.
[00:29:02.338 --> 00:29:02.719]  There's more?
[00:29:02.739 --> 00:29:04.120]  I mean, this is just two of them.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.041]  I haven't even covered them properly.
[00:29:06.443 --> 00:29:07.544]  People ask why I have so much energy.
[00:29:07.584 --> 00:29:08.905]  This is epic, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:09.045 --> 00:29:09.866]  We have them.
[00:29:10.287 --> 00:29:11.208]  We have them now.
[00:29:11.408 --> 00:29:13.250]  They are in our political gun sites.
[00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:14.771]  Fire at will.
[00:29:15.392 --> 00:29:16.073]  You take this.
[00:29:17.719 --> 00:29:27.268]  I went and ate this morning at a little liberal diner in East Austin, and I had all the liberals coming over saying, you're right, you're right, Hillary's really scary, she's evil.
[00:29:27.748 --> 00:29:28.609]  Well, is Trump okay?
[00:29:28.629 --> 00:29:32.672]  And I go, well, he's probably a narcissist like anybody, you know, who's high-powered like that, but I said,
[00:29:33.601 --> 00:29:39.466]  Look, we know Hillary's pure evil, and I said, you gotta get past all the trendiness, and you just gotta tell everybody, we gotta support Trump.
[00:29:39.806 --> 00:29:41.487]  They're like, no, no, everybody's been saying that.
[00:29:42.088 --> 00:29:42.848]  You're right, you're right.
[00:29:42.868 --> 00:29:43.909]  I'm like, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:45.991]  I mean, people need to know, man.
[00:29:46.031 --> 00:29:47.472]  You think Trump's involved in all this crap?
[00:29:48.032 --> 00:29:48.953]  All this subterfuge?
[00:29:48.993 --> 00:29:49.874]  He does whatever he wants.
[00:29:49.914 --> 00:29:51.755]  There's no subterfuge with Trump.
[00:29:52.496 --> 00:29:54.017]  There's no, unless you just straight shooting.
[00:29:56.018 --> 00:29:57.880]  He doesn't listen to hardly anybody, but straight shooting.
[00:29:59.082 --> 00:30:02.083]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.003 --> 00:30:05.804]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.806 --> 00:30:13.027]  Hey, it's another story by the Lord of the Flies, Hillary Clinton.
[00:30:13.107 --> 00:30:17.268]  Hillary worried about jihadists entering with refugees in private speech.
[00:30:17.708 --> 00:30:19.809]  I'm not loving it.
[00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:21.229]  Duh, we could have told you that.
[00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:25.711]  In a private 2000 speech, Hillary Clinton worried about the risk of jihadists entering Jordan
[00:30:25.851 --> 00:30:29.574]  With legitimate refugees, because they can't possibly vet all those refugees.
[00:30:29.634 --> 00:30:30.955]  Yeah, we know you can't vet them all.
[00:30:31.035 --> 00:30:37.019]  And yet, you want to allow 55,000 Syrians to come in annually, unvetted.
[00:30:37.119 --> 00:30:49.829]  But you're going to go to this private luncheon and tell them that it's probably a bad idea to take in refugees because of the fact there could be some extremists that get in there and then come over here to America and possibly chop off our heads.
[00:30:49.949 --> 00:30:51.530]  We've been saying that since day one.
[00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:52.690]  We need to secure the border!
[00:30:52.730 --> 00:31:00.572]  We need someone like Donald Trump to come in here and make America great again, because the Clintons have done nothing but fail their entire political career, and I'm sick and tired of it.
[00:31:00.612 --> 00:31:05.074]  So November 8th, get your butt to the polls, go out there, vote, make America great again.
[00:31:05.094 --> 00:31:06.214]  Let's secure those borders.
[00:31:06.314 --> 00:31:09.415]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.

[00:32:09.617 --> 00:32:14.701]  With the election just around the corner, I have to ask, have you gotten your Hillary for Prison t-shirt yet?
[00:32:15.221 --> 00:32:18.524]  After the election, this t-shirt will no longer be available.
[00:32:18.764 --> 00:32:24.409]  We only have a finite number of these, so be sure to get to Infowarsstore.com and get yours today.
[00:32:24.949 --> 00:32:28.832]  Even Hillary Clinton supporters like the Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[00:32:29.033 --> 00:32:30.454]  I'm voting for Hillary.
[00:32:30.734 --> 00:32:33.938]  This is a meme that is still viral worldwide.
[00:32:34.178 --> 00:32:35.079]  Hillary for prison.
[00:32:35.379 --> 00:32:41.085]  Folks, we want to see Hillary Clinton put in prison, and we also want to see InfoWars go to the next level.
[00:32:41.446 --> 00:32:47.973]  It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.
[00:32:48.614 --> 00:32:49.535]  Because you'd be in jail.
[00:32:50.335 --> 00:32:51.476]  Help us accomplish both.
[00:32:51.956 --> 00:32:53.317]  Fund us in the Infowar.

[00:33:22.817 --> 00:33:28.108]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[00:33:33.018 --> 00:33:36.380]  Alright, folks, I want to open the phones up and not just hog the air time.
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.101]  I want to get your response to these WikiLeaks.
[00:33:38.121 --> 00:33:41.863]  There's hundreds and hundreds of them, and they can spin this however they want.
[00:33:42.364 --> 00:33:46.786]  Daily Caller has it, InfoWars has it, WikiLeaks bombshell Hillary Clinton hates everyday Americans.
[00:33:47.127 --> 00:33:49.388]  The way they're spinning it, though, is she hates to use that term.
[00:33:49.468 --> 00:33:52.810]  No, that's what she basically means, from my view, but you can interpret it the other way.
[00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:55.271]  How about, though, when you get into this email I just mentioned?
[00:33:56.052 --> 00:34:00.855]  Clinton campaign email outlines effort to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[00:34:01.095 --> 00:34:02.036]  Here, let's read this.
[00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:12.253]  As I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics, and in general, conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[00:34:12.273 --> 00:34:19.895]  Okay, this is Ivy, Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, and of course one of the top advisors talking to the Clintons.
[00:34:20.435 --> 00:34:28.998]  He writes, As I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government,
[00:34:30.555 --> 00:34:34.779]  Drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizen.
[00:34:34.799 --> 00:34:38.722]  Remember the New York Times articles where they say we should all work together basically to lie about Trump?
[00:34:38.802 --> 00:34:39.603]  You know, that's ethical.
[00:34:39.943 --> 00:34:40.383]  It goes on.
[00:34:40.804 --> 00:34:42.485]  The unawareness remains strong.
[00:34:42.585 --> 00:34:43.146]  Talk about the public.
[00:34:44.026 --> 00:34:47.849]  But compliance, that's submission, is obviously fading rapidly.
[00:34:48.930 --> 00:34:51.532]  This problem demands some serious, serious thinking.
[00:34:52.153 --> 00:34:53.294]  And not just poll driven.
[00:34:53.734 --> 00:34:55.596]  Demographically inspired messaging.
[00:34:57.708 --> 00:34:58.969]  They want racial control.
[00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:00.991]  And Soros says it plain out.
[00:35:01.532 --> 00:35:03.374]  We're going to bring in Muslims that are incompatible.
[00:35:04.475 --> 00:35:06.017]  We're going to have people be put in their groups.
[00:35:06.797 --> 00:35:12.203]  We're going to then stir them up to cause a bunch of trouble so that the population then starts disliking them.
[00:35:12.463 --> 00:35:13.765]  And now you have divide and conquer.
[00:35:13.825 --> 00:35:15.526]  They're creating racism.
[00:35:16.462 --> 00:35:24.004]  They're creating re-segregation at the high schools and colleges, with the minority saying, we don't want to be integrated.
[00:35:24.845 --> 00:35:26.465]  The opposite of Martin Luther King.
[00:35:27.165 --> 00:35:29.606]  A total betrayal of all that, whatever you thought of it.
[00:35:31.367 --> 00:35:37.849]  Now look what they're doing, and they're calling it anti-racism as they attack the language, the culture, everything.
[00:35:39.229 --> 00:35:45.451]  Looking at Drudge, Assange, drones Hillary, releases another thousand emails from Podesta.
[00:35:48.117 --> 00:35:50.118]  Hal Podesta is obsessed with UFOs.
[00:35:51.458 --> 00:35:56.820]  Hal, Saudi Arabia and Qatar are funding ISIS, which they've always known that Saudi Arabia and Qatar are funding it.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.121]  So is Hillary and Obama and NATO.
[00:35:59.201 --> 00:35:59.441]  Boom!
[00:35:59.461 --> 00:36:00.082]  That's big news.
[00:36:00.522 --> 00:36:04.543]  And it should be translated, Hal, Hillary worked Saudi Arabia and ISIS to fund it.
[00:36:04.563 --> 00:36:05.424]  I mean, we've always known that.
[00:36:05.464 --> 00:36:06.024]  We broke that.
[00:36:06.304 --> 00:36:06.964]  Everybody knows it.
[00:36:07.484 --> 00:36:11.326]  General Flynn, the head of defense intelligence, went public and said it last year.
[00:36:12.495 --> 00:36:15.076]  Univision chief urged Clinton to hit harder.
[00:36:15.516 --> 00:36:16.477]  Yes, and all the race baiting.
[00:36:16.837 --> 00:36:19.838]  CNN Jake Tapper congratulated Podesta.
[00:36:20.319 --> 00:36:23.800]  CNBC John Harwood advised his campaign.
[00:36:25.041 --> 00:36:26.501]  And he was a debate moderator.
[00:36:26.621 --> 00:36:26.962]  Hmm.
[00:36:27.522 --> 00:36:31.043]  New York Times gave Hillary veto power on quotes.
[00:36:31.243 --> 00:36:32.764]  Wow, running the New York Times.
[00:36:32.904 --> 00:36:33.665]  That's the real headline.
[00:36:34.605 --> 00:36:36.006]  She's the editor-in-chief of the New York Times.
[00:36:36.026 --> 00:36:36.606]  Hmm, boy.
[00:36:37.286 --> 00:36:40.908]  Boston Globe coordinated to max her presence in paper.
[00:36:42.079 --> 00:36:43.439]  She was told when to smile.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.421]  Aid calls Chelsea spoiled brat.
[00:36:46.561 --> 00:36:48.041]  Notice she was told when to smile.
[00:36:48.061 --> 00:36:49.041]  They have to handle her now.
[00:36:49.382 --> 00:36:51.102]  She's degenerated so much mentally.
[00:36:51.302 --> 00:36:52.323]  She was an amazing mind.
[00:36:54.563 --> 00:36:55.484]  Brazil busted.
[00:36:55.524 --> 00:36:58.405]  DNC chief shared CNN town hall questions.
[00:36:59.345 --> 00:37:02.106]  Oh, caught rigging the debates, caught rigging the town halls.
[00:37:02.126 --> 00:37:04.287]  Yeah, you got actors and actresses too.
[00:37:04.847 --> 00:37:05.627]  Boom, caught.
[00:37:06.608 --> 00:37:07.108]  Confirmed.
[00:37:08.177 --> 00:37:09.860]  Leaked Sanders dirt to Herding.
[00:37:10.281 --> 00:37:11.663]  Directed the media against Sanders.
[00:37:11.964 --> 00:37:13.466]  Clinton, we already knew that, but just more proof.
[00:37:13.727 --> 00:37:16.472]  Clinton campaign had discussions with DOJ.
[00:37:16.492 --> 00:37:17.473]  Oh!
[00:37:18.415 --> 00:37:19.797]  Oh, how to not go after Herd.
[00:37:20.158 --> 00:37:21.039]  Totally illegal!
[00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:28.274]  Their campaign had discussions with the head of the Justice Department, Loretta Lynch.
[00:37:28.915 --> 00:37:32.738]  And Bill Clinton had illegal discussions on that airplane, but it's okay because they're the bosses now.
[00:37:33.038 --> 00:37:37.242]  We the bosses, we the bosses, just as State Department coordinated email release.
[00:37:37.542 --> 00:37:41.666]  So as they coordinated the email release, they were coordinating with the DOJ.
[00:37:42.907 --> 00:37:49.833]  And it's come out, that's coming up next, it's come out, ladies and gentlemen, that indeed
[00:37:51.479 --> 00:37:59.761]  There were illegal emails, there were people asking for favors saying, hey, I've given money, now shut down this lawsuit, give me this deal, introduce me to the Chinese president.
[00:37:59.861 --> 00:38:00.461]  It's all here.
[00:38:00.821 --> 00:38:03.501]  Thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of pages.
[00:38:04.342 --> 00:38:06.122]  Thousands more emails coming out every day.
[00:38:06.862 --> 00:38:08.782]  Individual emails sometimes are 20 pages long.
[00:38:09.163 --> 00:38:10.263]  We're trying to go through it all.
[00:38:10.503 --> 00:38:12.583]  Here, this is mind-blowing.
[00:38:12.603 --> 00:38:12.643]  800-259-9231.
[00:38:20.205 --> 00:38:21.566]  Again, game changer.
[00:38:21.606 --> 00:38:24.247]  New WikiLeaks confirms Hillary deliberately criminally deleted emails.
[00:38:24.428 --> 00:38:26.109]  That is broken down on InfoWars.com.
[00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:29.951]  Hillary in linked emails.
[00:38:29.991 --> 00:38:31.472]  Saudi Arabia Qatar funding ISIS.
[00:38:31.492 --> 00:38:32.512]  Just mentioned that, but there it is.
[00:38:33.153 --> 00:38:34.173]  There's another weird one.
[00:38:34.214 --> 00:38:36.155]  Hillary Clinton literally croaks like a frog.
[00:38:36.215 --> 00:38:37.035]  That's coming up later.
[00:38:39.657 --> 00:38:41.338]  Now, let's get into some of these other WikiLeaks.
[00:38:47.582 --> 00:38:49.443]  Man, I tell you, this is just blowing my mind.
[00:38:50.572 --> 00:38:55.299]  It's blowing my mind that things have gotten this crazy in this country.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.063]  And as you just look at these unfolding...
[00:38:59.423 --> 00:39:00.424]  It makes the head spin.
[00:39:00.444 --> 00:39:03.506]  I mean, how much more has to come out until she gets in trouble?
[00:39:03.706 --> 00:39:04.967]  She can't get in trouble!
[00:39:05.468 --> 00:39:09.211]  They've got the FBI director that used to do their taxes, and from their law firm.
[00:39:09.851 --> 00:39:11.573]  They've got Loretta Lynch, literally their minion.
[00:39:11.813 --> 00:39:21.520]  They've got a judge they appointed, Obama appointed, with these reportedly made-up child rape, teenager rape stories on Trump from 22 years ago.
[00:39:22.021 --> 00:39:25.904]  They have got their people in every major agency.
[00:39:28.135 --> 00:39:38.900]  And they're saying, Jay Johnson, all of them, are openly coming out now with Loretta Lynch saying, we're going to start censoring talk, radio, the internet, the Federal Elections Commission, the FCC.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:44.782]  There are board members on both of them that are not globalists, and they're saying, they're openly saying they're going to start shutting everybody down.
[00:39:45.442 --> 00:39:49.924]  And as soon as Hillary gets in, she said, the alt-right does not have a right to exist.
[00:39:49.984 --> 00:39:51.125]  And folks, are you stupid out there?
[00:39:52.485 --> 00:39:56.307]  If there was a Republican and he said, Michael Moore doesn't have a right to exist,
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:58.540]  I would say that's wrong.
[00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:07.863]  As much as I disagree with Michael Moore on many issues, he has a First Amendment right, and this president needs to be impeached if he makes any moves towards free speech.
[00:40:07.943 --> 00:40:21.927]  I mean, I would 100%... The so-called left, the fascist left, praised Dinesh D'Souza, who got four friends to give a few thousand dollars and didn't fill out the right PAC information, and he was sent to prison.
[00:40:23.649 --> 00:40:27.412]  And Hillary can get money from the Communist Chinese and the Saudi Arabians totally illegally and it's just fine.
[00:40:28.192 --> 00:40:29.153]  They celebrate that.
[00:40:29.673 --> 00:40:30.494]  They call him a crook.
[00:40:30.794 --> 00:40:31.735]  They say he deserves it.
[00:40:31.815 --> 00:40:32.435]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:40:34.657 --> 00:40:36.898]  I've read these different federal election rules.
[00:40:36.938 --> 00:40:37.979]  They're impossible to follow.
[00:40:38.539 --> 00:40:39.680]  It's all selectively enforced.
[00:40:40.581 --> 00:40:41.882]  And that's what they've set us up in.
[00:40:41.902 --> 00:40:47.606]  The essence of tyranny is when it's selective enforcement, there's laws making everything illegal, except they don't follow the laws or they get waivers.
[00:40:48.967 --> 00:40:49.627]  Just like Obamacare.
[00:40:49.988 --> 00:40:51.969]  Thousands of big companies were given Obamacare waivers.
[00:40:52.269 --> 00:40:53.230]  They don't have to get Obamacare.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:58.706]  They can keep their employees at minimum wage and not do it.
[00:40:58.946 --> 00:41:00.549]  But then everybody else does, and guess what they do?
[00:41:00.729 --> 00:41:02.051]  They downsize or shut down.
[00:41:02.352 --> 00:41:02.833]  That's fine.
[00:41:03.454 --> 00:41:05.777]  Because the other part of the economy that's exempt, it grows.
[00:41:06.098 --> 00:41:07.580]  That's what this is.
[00:41:12.264 --> 00:41:13.425]  That's what's unfolding here.
[00:41:14.005 --> 00:41:20.810]  And you've got David Brock openly run by the White House and run by the Clinton campaign in these super PACs giving money to himself as a pass-through.
[00:41:21.491 --> 00:41:22.352]  They say that's illegal.
[00:41:22.532 --> 00:41:23.492]  But hey, so what?
[00:41:23.572 --> 00:41:24.373]  He doesn't go to jail.
[00:41:24.913 --> 00:41:26.515]  Because he's got fake Einstein hair.
[00:41:26.535 --> 00:41:31.759]  And as long as you're with the Democrats and have fake Einstein hair, and act like you're intellectual, everything's okay.
[00:41:34.781 --> 00:41:36.322]  Now let's continue here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:36.342 --> 00:41:36.562]  800-259-9231.
[00:41:36.702 --> 00:41:38.444]  I've got a bunch of clips I want to get to.
[00:41:42.082 --> 00:41:45.585]  And then we're going to start going to your phone calls, but here's some of the other news I haven't gotten to.
[00:41:46.425 --> 00:41:47.486]  Jerry Falwell Jr.
[00:41:47.526 --> 00:41:50.888]  said this yesterday, thinks the GOP establishment leaked the Trump tape.
[00:41:51.188 --> 00:41:53.950]  It might even have been a conspiracy.
[00:41:54.451 --> 00:41:59.034]  Well, I know this, and Trump knew it was too sophisticated, because quite frankly, the public's dumbed down on average.
[00:41:59.054 --> 00:41:59.654]  He didn't go there.
[00:41:59.935 --> 00:42:00.855]  It's highly edited.
[00:42:02.777 --> 00:42:04.478]  He's being led on in discussions.
[00:42:05.198 --> 00:42:07.200]  I've had people do this to me and try to edit it, and
[00:42:09.656 --> 00:42:14.739]  A few times, even kind of halfway through, a black man was like, ooh, we got this tape of you saying this, and I'm like, yeah, that's clearly edited, go ahead and release it.
[00:42:16.039 --> 00:42:18.101]  And of course, it never gets released, because it's edited.
[00:42:20.682 --> 00:42:21.582]  It's all mixed together.
[00:42:22.763 --> 00:42:29.407]  You listen to it clearly, he's talking about she's married, and when he found that out, then he, you know, but oh, then she's married, so oh, you can tell they cut there.
[00:42:29.827 --> 00:42:31.128]  He's like, yeah, they'll let you do anything.
[00:42:32.308 --> 00:42:35.070]  He means like they're up in his face on him, and then he can grab them.
[00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:36.991]  It's crude, it's not good.
[00:42:38.575 --> 00:42:40.197]  But compared to Bill Clinton, it's nothing.
[00:42:40.217 --> 00:42:40.818]  He apologized.
[00:42:40.998 --> 00:42:42.640]  The point is, do they get in trouble for anything?
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:43.160]  No.
[00:42:45.163 --> 00:42:49.067]  The public's told to selectively only get upset about this in mind control.
[00:42:49.968 --> 00:42:51.149]  So Jerry Falwell Jr.
[00:42:51.169 --> 00:42:53.832]  thinks the GOP establishment leaked the Trump tape.
[00:42:53.933 --> 00:42:54.413]  Absolutely.
[00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:12.635]  Some of the decent folks that are left from the Christian right are finally woken up to how evil the Republican establishment is and they realize that Trump's got a lot of really good patriots like General Flynn and others around him that are advising him who really do want to try to fix this country and aren't out to wreck the nation.
[00:43:15.096 --> 00:43:19.958]  Continuing, this came out today, did Paul Ryan's top advisor leak the Trump tape?
[00:43:20.814 --> 00:43:26.240]  And then it goes on to people connected high-level media saying, no indeed that is the source of it.
[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:36.611]  Was the infamous Trump tape in which the Republican candidate, well yeah it came from the bushes, made lewd remarks about women leaked by Dan Senior, Paul Ryan's top advisor.
[00:43:36.891 --> 00:43:42.658]  That's the story swirling around the internet after Senior's wife, former NBC reporter,
[00:43:43.991 --> 00:43:45.952]  Campbell Brown appeared to confirm the claim.
[00:43:46.512 --> 00:43:54.094]  Brown quoted a tweet and said, rumblings that Campbell Brown and Dan Senor were behind the Trump tape leak.
[00:43:54.854 --> 00:43:57.695]  And then replied, yep, still having fun after all these years.
[00:43:58.195 --> 00:43:59.455]  Key to a happy marriage.
[00:44:01.836 --> 00:44:04.016]  He himself later denied the claims.
[00:44:04.277 --> 00:44:05.177]  So, there you go.
[00:44:05.557 --> 00:44:08.518]  Point is, is it's all a dirty trick, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:08.558 --> 00:44:13.099]  Continuing, but here's the most important part I'm getting to in just one moment.
[00:44:14.733 --> 00:44:26.370]  I even have friends and family that I know are smart on most occasions who just get into the mind control and they go, but the New York Times says Hillary's winning in early voting.
[00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:28.193]  And then you read the article and it's not even true.
[00:44:28.253 --> 00:44:29.234]  They just say it in the headline.
[00:44:29.821 --> 00:44:33.462]  I mean, they were the ones saying 94% chance of winning in our algorithm.
[00:44:33.482 --> 00:44:33.782]  Now it's 87.
[00:44:33.882 --> 00:44:37.483]  It's there to create the perception.
[00:44:38.264 --> 00:44:49.087]  I mean, CNN admits that they sample 46% Democrats to 22% Republicans in one.
[00:44:49.147 --> 00:44:51.388]  Another, was it 42 to like 27?
[00:44:52.068 --> 00:44:54.449]  I mean, they're basically double sampling
[00:44:55.655 --> 00:44:58.337]  Democrats, and then saying Hillary wins by 15 points.
[00:44:59.038 --> 00:44:59.739]  Well, of course!
[00:45:00.839 --> 00:45:06.424]  Of course, if you've got basically double the Democrats in the sample, she's gonna win.
[00:45:07.965 --> 00:45:11.368]  But if you actually do the math, what that poll tells you is Trump's 10, 15 points ahead.
[00:45:12.009 --> 00:45:14.591]  And that's why they're in abject, total panic mode.
[00:45:15.051 --> 00:45:22.197]  I read that email earlier by one of their top campaign advisors saying, we've kept the public in a trance, we've kept them in the dark, but they're starting to break out of it, and
[00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:24.289]  We've got to do something here.
[00:45:24.689 --> 00:45:26.450]  They know you're breaking out.
[00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:28.090]  People are seeing through the facade.
[00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:40.593]  Because it was Hillary's turn, and she's this half-living, obviously corrupt and evil person that represents the establishment, and they're so arrogant they try to sell us something old.
[00:45:42.233 --> 00:45:43.553]  And people know the economy's in trouble.
[00:45:43.573 --> 00:45:45.254]  They know when they say it's the greatest economy ever.
[00:45:45.414 --> 00:45:46.614]  That's what Obama said last year.
[00:45:46.674 --> 00:45:47.174]  That's a lie.
[00:45:49.534 --> 00:45:50.475]  They know all this.
[00:45:50.575 --> 00:45:52.536]  They know, they know, and they're learning more.
[00:45:52.776 --> 00:45:53.817]  And the establishment's panicking.
[00:45:54.057 --> 00:45:54.778]  So what are they going to pull?
[00:45:55.798 --> 00:45:56.439]  Election fraud.
[00:45:56.719 --> 00:46:02.823]  And all they've got to do is convince you that it's not happening and have some scandal that, well, after the big scandal, you know, Hillary won.
[00:46:04.464 --> 00:46:06.606]  They're just convincing you to believe it now.
[00:46:10.088 --> 00:46:15.272]  I'm on the streets of Austin, Texas, which is like San Francisco of Texas in many areas.
[00:46:17.097 --> 00:46:21.599]  And almost every liberal I talk to is awake and really concerned and upset about what's happening.
[00:46:21.999 --> 00:46:23.460]  And says, yeah, Hillary really freaks me out.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.601]  She stole it from Bernie Sanders and now all this.
[00:46:26.041 --> 00:46:28.242]  Yeah, but Trump's racist.
[00:46:28.262 --> 00:46:32.343]  They'll actually say, but you know, he did say all Mexicans are rapists and he didn't ever say that.
[00:46:32.383 --> 00:46:33.044]  It's crazy.
[00:46:33.064 --> 00:46:35.685]  And I'll pull the clip up and show them, oh, I guess he didn't say that.
[00:46:36.285 --> 00:46:40.427]  They just don't want to vote for a racist because that's their identity, that they're not a racist.
[00:46:40.487 --> 00:46:41.247]  It's all mind control.
[00:46:42.196 --> 00:46:43.277]  I'll get to that here in just a second.
[00:46:44.638 --> 00:46:52.525]  We are going to be ending a special today that is 23% off DNA Force.
[00:46:52.545 --> 00:46:53.505]  That ends tonight at midnight.
[00:46:53.545 --> 00:46:54.746]  It's our flagship product.
[00:46:57.208 --> 00:46:59.831]  Bio PQQ CoQ10.
[00:47:01.992 --> 00:47:03.874]  It's got a bunch of other compounds that help you absorb it.
[00:47:04.334 --> 00:47:05.976]  Look at what Bio PQQ does.
[00:47:06.556 --> 00:47:09.839]  This is the true life-based system.
[00:47:10.219 --> 00:47:11.000]  It's not synthetic.
[00:47:17.256 --> 00:47:18.857]  And it's amazing.
[00:47:18.877 --> 00:47:21.520]  There's 175 clinical studies, extremely hard to secure.
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:32.748]  It has the same amount, the BioPQQ serving in each pill, of four giant, I guess it's bushels, it calculates out to like 50 cartons of blueberries.
[00:47:33.409 --> 00:47:34.990]  Just do the math yourself, research it.
[00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:36.992]  DNA Force, it supports the broadcast.
[00:47:37.012 --> 00:47:38.133]  Thank you for all your support.
[00:47:38.473 --> 00:47:40.615]  We have an amazing formula.
[00:47:41.784 --> 00:47:43.045]  Of course!
[00:48:01.232 --> 00:48:09.374]  Again, that's Biome Defense, 25 billion live and active cultures, supports healthy flora, 23 probiotic strains, or the 50 billion live and active cultures, 23 different strains.
[00:48:10.154 --> 00:48:13.155]  And so one is half the price of the other for whoever's on a budget.
[00:48:13.755 --> 00:48:15.295]  But I tell you, gut flora is so key.
[00:48:15.355 --> 00:48:20.436]  Infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.

[00:48:24.137 --> 00:48:25.177]  Even if you want to order online,

[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:31.160]  We have a great crew over there.
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:40.886]  They're really standing by until about 6 o'clock every night, and then it rolls over to a great answering service of operators we've had for 20 years that do a great job as well, but not as good as our folks there in-house, obviously.
[00:48:42.167 --> 00:48:42.888]  Seven days a week.
[00:48:44.066 --> 00:48:46.347]  24 hours a day, 365-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[00:48:47.328 --> 00:48:54.892]  Biome Defense, probiotic, DNA Force, and a bunch of other products.
[00:48:55.333 --> 00:48:59.215]  You can sign up and get auto-ship and get 10% off additionally on the type of things you want to reorder.

[00:49:05.838 --> 00:49:06.619]  And listen, we make mistakes.
[00:49:10.629 --> 00:49:14.033]  We jump the gun, we get things wrong, maybe 2% of the time, 3% of the time.
[00:49:14.834 --> 00:49:17.117]  Sometimes worse when we're doing 24-hour broadcasts or whatever.
[00:49:17.337 --> 00:49:21.302]  But we're trying to tell the truth, we have a good grasp of history, we have an amazing spectrum of guests.
[00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:30.435]  We're dedicated investigative journalists, and we're one of the main clearinghouses now of leaks and video and information that exposes the New World Order.
[00:49:31.256 --> 00:49:35.879]  And we're not just letting the globalists bring this stuff out and then demonize America to bring us down and bring in global government.
[00:49:36.099 --> 00:49:38.020]  We're exposing it to an outside force.
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:40.822]  We're partially guilty, all of us, for going along with it.
[00:49:41.202 --> 00:49:48.487]  But we're pointing out, though, that America has been swallowed and been captive and is being used as a power slave, basically, to take over the world.
[00:49:48.927 --> 00:49:49.987]  And I'm saying not in our name.
[00:49:50.948 --> 00:49:51.488]  I want peace.
[00:49:51.588 --> 00:49:52.188]  I want justice.
[00:49:52.289 --> 00:49:53.469]  I don't want to fight with the Muslims.
[00:49:53.909 --> 00:49:57.530]  I want the radical orthodox Wahhabis to be dealt with.
[00:49:57.970 --> 00:49:59.791]  Most Muslims don't want to live under the slavery.
[00:50:00.131 --> 00:50:02.812]  Most Muslims I know actually agree there should be a reformation.
[00:50:05.813 --> 00:50:07.174]  But I want to defend the unborn.
[00:50:08.014 --> 00:50:09.234]  I want to promote sovereignty.
[00:50:09.314 --> 00:50:10.515]  I want to promote private property.
[00:50:11.831 --> 00:50:14.373]  I just want prosperity and justice, just like you do.
[00:50:14.973 --> 00:50:17.955]  And we're coming together, and InfoWars is a major platform of that.
[00:50:17.995 --> 00:50:23.438]  So, you're not just getting some of the best products out there at amazing prices, you are supporting the tip of the spear.
[00:50:23.498 --> 00:50:25.319]  Everybody says the tip of the spear, and I wish they were.
[00:50:25.599 --> 00:50:25.939]  We are.
[00:50:25.979 --> 00:50:26.940]  It's a very dangerous position.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.642]  We need to be sharpened, we need to be supported, we need to be prayed for, and thank you, I know you're doing that.
[00:50:30.862 --> 00:50:31.542]  We have providence.
[00:50:33.143 --> 00:50:36.225]  Also, the Hillary for Prison shirt, in 27 days, I'm not going to sell it anymore.
[00:50:38.254 --> 00:50:38.735]  That's it.
[00:50:38.755 --> 00:50:41.278]  We have a limited edition Gadsden Lock Her Up shirt.
[00:50:41.298 --> 00:50:42.139]  We're doing one run of.
[00:50:42.259 --> 00:50:42.880]  Made in America.
[00:50:43.721 --> 00:50:44.482]  Very high quality.
[00:50:44.522 --> 00:50:46.184]  Very soft fabric.
[00:50:46.204 --> 00:50:46.764]  Feels so good.
[00:50:47.245 --> 00:50:48.406]  My favorite type of shirt to work out in.
[00:50:48.727 --> 00:50:50.609]  We have the Molon Labe shirts and so much more.
[00:50:50.689 --> 00:50:54.514]  Infowarstore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and your funding is what makes it all possible.
[00:50:58.058 --> 00:51:07.327]  All right, I've got the fraud on the poll side, then your call straight ahead, then a bunch of special guests, and big surprises tomorrow in studio.
[00:51:07.847 --> 00:51:08.287]  Stay with us.
[00:51:12.725 --> 00:51:17.688]  Now another shirt that was designed and licensed from Roger Stone is the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[00:51:18.348 --> 00:51:21.029]  Looks like the, you know, communist style Obama Hope shirt.
[00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:27.713]  But says, rape, wear it, get aggressive, start the conversations, get on TV with it.
[00:51:27.733 --> 00:51:28.773]  In fact, I'm going to say this right now.
[00:51:29.194 --> 00:51:39.379]  Anyone that gets on national TV with the shirt, clearly, for more than five seconds, gets a thousand dollars.
[00:51:40.987 --> 00:51:52.644]  That means, you know, behind cameras, you name it, anyone that gets it on air on national TV and gets the words out, Bill Clinton is a rapist, are things along that line with a bullhorn.
[00:51:52.684 --> 00:51:53.686]  I could go to this right now. $5,000.
[00:51:57.671 --> 00:51:59.053]  Until a budget of $100,000 has been spent.
[00:52:13.468 --> 00:52:19.071]  I think one of the kind of the things that we really need to be looking at in this debate is that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:52:19.191 --> 00:52:20.151]  Infowars.com.
[00:52:20.251 --> 00:52:21.272]  Infowars.com.
[00:52:21.352 --> 00:52:22.232]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[00:52:22.552 --> 00:52:23.633]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:52:23.653 --> 00:52:23.933]  Alright.
[00:52:23.953 --> 00:52:24.973]  Bill Clinton.
[00:52:24.993 --> 00:52:31.716]  I got this Hillary for prison t-shirt and I just want everyone to know about this like big presidential campaign that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:52:31.836 --> 00:52:32.557]  Infowars.com.
[00:52:33.537 --> 00:52:36.578]  Okay, thank you very much, Terrence.
[00:52:36.638 --> 00:52:38.519]  He doesn't age.
[00:52:38.859 --> 00:52:40.139]  No, he doesn't.
[00:52:40.179 --> 00:52:41.600]  He looks great.
[00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:44.161]  We're all gonna rickroll.
[00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:45.641]  Exactly.
[00:52:47.382 --> 00:52:50.783]  We've had a $100,000 contest before.
[00:52:50.803 --> 00:52:51.223]  My budget's $100,000.
[00:52:51.263 --> 00:52:55.324]  That means if a bunch of people do this, I'll pay up to $100,000 and stop it.
[00:53:04.774 --> 00:53:09.200]  That's $1,000 if you just get the shirt on national TV.
[00:53:10.942 --> 00:53:13.486]  Visually rape, okay?
[00:53:14.611 --> 00:53:15.031]  It is.
[00:53:16.272 --> 00:53:16.632]  It is.
[00:53:16.652 --> 00:53:19.713]  $5,000 if you get the audio.
[00:53:19.753 --> 00:53:20.413]  Legally and lawfully.
[00:53:20.433 --> 00:53:29.756]  They got to be outdoors, on their little bench, you got to have a bullhorn, you got to have the shirt on, or have somebody with it, or maybe a big sign with it on it, and two of you hold it up, and then somebody else bullhorns.
[00:53:30.156 --> 00:53:33.337]  Bill Clinton is a rapist, not a philanderer.
[00:53:33.917 --> 00:53:35.358]  Hillary covers up the rape.
[00:53:40.276 --> 00:53:42.957]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[00:53:43.178 --> 00:53:46.259]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[00:53:46.519 --> 00:53:47.300]  Because it's already here.
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:48.360]  It's being announced.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:52.182]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[00:53:52.602 --> 00:53:54.503]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:53:54.643 --> 00:53:56.204]  A new battleship in the fight.
[00:53:56.384 --> 00:53:57.405]  InfoWars Live.
[00:53:57.585 --> 00:53:58.405]  Available right now.
[00:53:58.685 --> 00:54:00.026]  We're looking for a crew to manor.
[00:54:00.486 --> 00:54:02.868]  You gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[00:54:03.508 --> 00:54:04.488]  Or you gonna be part of history?
[00:54:05.029 --> 00:54:08.050]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[00:54:08.551 --> 00:54:09.111]  Take action!
[00:54:19.035 --> 00:54:23.058]  I really am talking a hundred miles an hour.
[00:54:23.578 --> 00:54:26.801]  I should probably come in at the start of the show at least each hour and tell you what we got on the plate.
[00:54:27.521 --> 00:54:29.383]  I have not hit but about 1 20th of the noose.
[00:54:33.451 --> 00:54:34.472]  And I'm not kidding.
[00:54:34.573 --> 00:54:36.735]  I mean, it's crazier from there on out.
[00:54:36.755 --> 00:54:38.497]  There are so many people confronting the Clintons.
[00:54:38.658 --> 00:54:41.962]  Hillary said she wouldn't be on the campaign trail for 20 days.
[00:54:42.122 --> 00:54:43.704]  She's now suddenly emerged.
[00:54:44.585 --> 00:54:48.890]  First time she emerges, a guy is in the stands behind her, takes off his shirt.
[00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:49.871]  He's a black American.
[00:54:50.973 --> 00:54:52.675]  And he's got the Hillary for
[00:54:56.161 --> 00:54:57.462]  Freudian slip, Hillary for prison.
[00:54:58.023 --> 00:55:05.670]  He has the Bill Clinton rape shirt on and then he walks down behind her and they take him out because he's not doing a good job of the photo op.
[00:55:06.791 --> 00:55:18.422]  And man, I tell you, he gets $5,000 just for the courage of doing this, being in that proximity and he didn't really get Hillary's a rapist out because they drug him away but he definitely shook them up big time.
[00:55:19.202 --> 00:55:21.503]  And we're gonna end up paying out, looks like the whole $100,000 on this.
[00:55:21.563 --> 00:55:23.324]  I'm gonna get this gentleman on the show.
[00:55:23.704 --> 00:55:25.645]  StopRape at InfoWars.com.
[00:55:26.046 --> 00:55:26.626]  Send us your info.
[00:55:26.646 --> 00:55:29.527]  I'm gonna get everybody on this show or the Nightly News.
[00:55:30.208 --> 00:55:32.649]  It's amazing what we've been learning from these folks.
[00:55:33.249 --> 00:55:36.411]  And listen, the reason we're doing this is she has covered up for Bill Clinton's rapes.
[00:55:37.371 --> 00:55:39.613]  She has covered up for pedophiles.
[00:55:40.673 --> 00:55:46.116]  And Joy Behar of The View, she got up there
[00:55:47.714 --> 00:55:51.556]  yesterday and said that well these women are tramps.
[00:55:53.236 --> 00:56:00.760]  One of these women that was on the stage that she's talking about in the full clip was 12 years old and was almost beaten to death and was in a coma.
[00:56:03.441 --> 00:56:10.464]  I mean other women had witnesses they were bleeding and Booklet is known for this and I just cannot believe what Democratic Party operatives they were.
[00:56:11.244 --> 00:56:16.747]  When I went on Joy Behar's show on CNN after I'd been on The View that same morning she said come over and be on my show
[00:56:17.788 --> 00:56:24.468]  She was so in thinking I was a Democrat that, and I don't find her that attractive, she's an older lady, but I mean, the sex appeal.
[00:56:25.552 --> 00:56:30.795]  In the room with her, before we taped the show, was just like a, like, oh, wow.
[00:56:30.815 --> 00:56:33.016]  I mean, it was actually very alluring.
[00:56:33.396 --> 00:56:38.419]  Even though I didn't find her physically attractive, it was just pouring the female, oh, I really like what you're doing.
[00:56:38.759 --> 00:56:39.779]  It's so sexy.
[00:56:40.019 --> 00:56:42.020]  Oh, oh, we're about to take this off.
[00:56:42.301 --> 00:56:42.981]  What are you doing later?
[00:56:43.001 --> 00:56:46.863]  I mean, it was like, and then I see her up there calling these women, these names.
[00:56:46.883 --> 00:56:48.484]  I don't even dislike Joy Behar.
[00:56:49.266 --> 00:56:59.313]  Just because she was so inviting, even though I disagree with her politics, she came off as so nice, and then she's so nasty to these women.
[00:56:59.393 --> 00:57:00.233]  It's just despicable.
[00:57:00.293 --> 00:57:01.074]  It makes me hate her.
[00:57:02.034 --> 00:57:08.599]  And the reason I tell that story is, she was very, let's just say, had a lot of hospitality.
[00:57:09.926 --> 00:57:12.407]  And that's all that happened, but she was pouring it out at me.
[00:57:12.988 --> 00:57:16.449]  Because she thought I hated the Bushes because I went on TV and talked about 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:57:16.669 --> 00:57:20.571]  That's the globalists, that's the Saudis, that's the criminal groups that Clintons are involved with as well.
[00:57:21.712 --> 00:57:25.274]  But that's just how party-driven they are, to give you an idea.
[00:57:27.694 --> 00:57:46.312]  That I've been at dinners with, like, the biggest Hollywood people there were, all because I put out these films that were pro-gun, anti-New World Order, but because they talked bad about the globalists at the Bushes, they'd sit there at parties and watch them in Hollywood and pat me on the back just because I was attacking the Bushes.
[00:57:47.913 --> 00:57:48.334]  Obliquely.
[00:57:49.153 --> 00:57:52.055]  Again, why I'm saying this is not to name-drop stories.
[00:57:52.595 --> 00:57:53.796]  These people are in a cult.
[00:57:54.537 --> 00:57:58.339]  If Donald Trump starts going sideways and doing a bunch of bad stuff, I'll come after him in two seconds.
[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:03.062]  I mean, I'm not in some cult of Donald Trump or the Republican Party.
[00:58:03.262 --> 00:58:04.283]  I hate the Republican Party.
[00:58:04.483 --> 00:58:07.125]  The Republican Party establishment is totally after them.
[00:58:07.685 --> 00:58:10.667]  Here's shorter clips we're going to break of Behar yesterday.
[00:58:10.727 --> 00:58:11.488]  Very, very shameful.
[00:58:11.508 --> 00:58:11.768]  Here it is.
[00:58:13.376 --> 00:58:22.743]  That's why when he brought up these allegations, I wonder if she missed the opportunity to address it in a way that the public would understand.
[00:58:23.204 --> 00:58:26.126]  That that's just not how you behave.
[00:58:26.166 --> 00:58:30.830]  I would like to apologize to those tramps that have slept with my husband.
[00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:32.311]  Maybe she could have said that.
[00:58:33.912 --> 00:58:39.114]  So, when we come back, we do have the audio of Hillary calling for an intervention and for them to stop the guy with the right shirt.
[00:58:39.254 --> 00:58:44.036]  With only 27 days left until the election, we have entered the final stretch.
[00:58:44.376 --> 00:58:46.757]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:58:51.279 --> 00:58:53.179]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:59.707 --> 00:59:03.730]  Hillary Clinton is posing as an advocate for domestic abuse victims.
[00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:07.172]  But behind closed doors, she's a violent abuser.

[00:59:17.384 --> 00:59:20.465]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[00:59:20.765 --> 00:59:21.525]  Because it's already here.
[00:59:21.925 --> 00:59:22.566]  It's being announced.
[00:59:22.946 --> 00:59:26.407]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.

[00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:38.710]  Or you gonna be part of history?

[00:59:55.464 --> 00:59:58.586]  The Clinton's War on Women, in stores now.
[01:00:02.169 --> 01:00:04.811]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:31.841 --> 01:00:34.025]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:34.485 --> 01:00:39.293]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:00:39.373 --> 01:00:42.778]  Alright, I want to go to Luke and Jason and Gary and Zach and Sherry and others.
[01:00:42.798 --> 01:00:43.880]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:54.298]  Obviously I need to take a breath because the last hour was just incredible how much we covered.
[01:00:54.338 --> 01:00:57.905]  I've got a bunch of clips I want to get to how they're planning to try to steal the election.
[01:00:57.945 --> 01:01:01.872]  We've got a clear vision now of what they're preparing the public mind for.
[01:01:02.901 --> 01:01:07.622]  And it's the preconditioning that's the tell on one of their major attack profile strategies.
[01:01:08.543 --> 01:01:11.224]  We've got Hillary should be indicted, but she can't be, basically.
[01:01:11.244 --> 01:01:16.265]  She probably, like I said, killed children on the White House lawn with a battle axe.
[01:01:16.445 --> 01:01:22.727]  And they would say she was giving blood to Mother Earth because she controls the Justice Department.
[01:01:23.047 --> 01:01:24.288]  And that's what comes out in the email.
[01:01:24.308 --> 01:01:30.870]  She's coordinating the Justice Department, telling them what to do, telling the State Department what to do, even after she's out of office.
[01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:32.530]  She's running the whole show.
[01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:34.391]  She's got her people in there.
[01:01:35.671 --> 01:01:37.512]  And it's them pay-per-play.
[01:01:37.572 --> 01:01:41.594]  Foreign governments, individuals, people getting $9 million lawsuits shut down, you know, giving her money.
[01:01:41.774 --> 01:01:42.574]  It's all in the new emails.
[01:01:42.854 --> 01:01:45.095]  They're up on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:45.195 --> 01:01:45.675]  Incredible.
[01:01:49.916 --> 01:01:56.639]  I'm going to start your calls now, but I'm going to go back to this Joy Behar thing, calling the women that were there at the event tramps.
[01:01:58.479 --> 01:02:03.163]  I guess that includes the little lady that was raped when she was 12 and in a coma for what, five days?
[01:02:03.183 --> 01:02:05.104]  That Hillary represented?
[01:02:05.465 --> 01:02:07.166]  She represented the pedophile?
[01:02:09.448 --> 01:02:16.474]  And she sat there and said, you liked it, you wanted it, didn't you?
[01:02:16.494 --> 01:02:25.060]  I mean, there's no way I could be a defense attorney and represent pedophiles when you know they're guilty, which she later admitted.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.622]  She got the guy off, it was just on probation.
[01:02:29.142 --> 01:02:29.663]  Light sentence.
[01:02:29.683 --> 01:02:30.824]  I'm going to go back to the history of it.
[01:02:32.265 --> 01:02:37.089]  But like giggling and laughing about it and sitting there and telling a little girl on the stand, you wanted it, you wanted it, didn't you?
[01:02:37.109 --> 01:02:41.954]  I mean, it's just like she hangs out with Aberdeen, whose mom's a creepozoid.
[01:02:42.494 --> 01:02:44.456]  She's all creepy looking and acts creepy.
[01:02:44.496 --> 01:02:50.021]  She's a creepy weirdo with flies landing on her and she ribbits and barks like a dog and stinks reportedly.
[01:02:50.361 --> 01:02:52.143]  Secret Service says he smells like a sewer.
[01:02:57.751 --> 01:02:59.272]  Jason in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:02:59.312 --> 01:02:59.652]  Go ahead.
[01:02:59.672 --> 01:03:02.993]  Hey Alex, how you doing, man?
[01:03:03.233 --> 01:03:03.773]  Good, my friend.
[01:03:05.073 --> 01:03:08.514]  Oh man, I've been trying to get on air since the RNC, man.
[01:03:08.554 --> 01:03:11.355]  I can't believe how big the radio show is getting here lately.
[01:03:11.375 --> 01:03:11.875]  It's awesome.
[01:03:12.476 --> 01:03:25.680]  Well, to be clear, the network that I'm on, that I use as a satellite carrier, with the great John Harmon up there in Minnesota, just to be clear since you brought this up, it has six phone lines.
[01:03:26.707 --> 01:03:28.227]  We have 15 phone lines.
[01:03:28.768 --> 01:03:29.748]  Potentially, it's digital.
[01:03:30.068 --> 01:03:33.369]  We got 23,000 phone calls the other night that came out of the system.
[01:03:33.409 --> 01:03:33.869]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:03:35.229 --> 01:03:36.970]  Yeah, just real quick.
[01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:42.951]  I know a while back you were talking about the copyright of Make America Great Again.
[01:03:43.712 --> 01:03:48.113]  Bobby Bones is a radio show host out of Nashville.
[01:03:48.593 --> 01:03:55.195]  His producer put a $1,000 bet down on Trump winning the election last year when it was 50 to 1.
[01:03:56.455 --> 01:03:59.137]  And so if Trump wins, he's going to get $50,000.
[01:03:59.177 --> 01:04:11.747]  Well, Bobby Bones found out that Make America Great Again was not copyrighted, so he copyrighted it and held it for ransom to Donald Trump to get a donation to St.
[01:04:11.787 --> 01:04:12.087]  Jude's.
[01:04:12.187 --> 01:04:15.730]  So if y'all want to check that out, that's the backstory of that.
[01:04:17.636 --> 01:04:28.180]  Then, Hillary Clinton hates all of us, which we know, and her hate is nothing but just a summary of the hate of the people that are pulling the puppet strings.
[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.661]  She's just doing what the bigger haters are doing.
[01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:33.362]  And that's why I got a plea for Mr. Trump.
[01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:35.523]  I've been wanting to talk to him if I could.
[01:04:35.583 --> 01:04:41.325]  Mr. Trump, I'm a 37-year-old husband of 15 years to an African-American woman.
[01:04:41.385 --> 01:04:42.145]  I'm a white male.
[01:04:42.485 --> 01:04:43.546]  We have five kids.
[01:04:44.406 --> 01:04:45.367]  Not on assistance.
[01:04:45.607 --> 01:04:49.509]  I'm the only one that works and it is a struggle.
[01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:58.153]  I've been watching Trump since I was 10 years old and he's been a champion to me since I first met him through WWE watching him on TV.
[01:04:58.193 --> 01:04:59.353]  Well brother, that's awesome.
[01:04:59.373 --> 01:04:59.874]  God bless you.
[01:04:59.894 --> 01:05:01.154]  I gotta jump and thank you Jason.
[01:05:01.194 --> 01:05:03.395]  I wanted to get into leaked emails but we'll do that with some other callers.
[01:05:03.696 --> 01:05:04.336]  Very interesting though.
[01:05:04.356 --> 01:05:04.696]  Thank you.
[01:05:04.976 --> 01:05:06.517]  More calls straight ahead on Alex Jones.
[01:05:09.926 --> 01:05:18.588]  Mr. Trump, you've got five things to say, ten things to say, and what you do, and by the way, whenever you go on any TV show, listen to me, I know what I'm talking about.
[01:05:18.608 --> 01:05:21.629]  You're going to say what you want to say, irrespective of what they ask you.
[01:05:21.649 --> 01:05:24.129]  And if they don't ask you, you say, you know, it's funny, that reminds me.
[01:05:24.149 --> 01:05:25.249]  And then you go right into it.
[01:05:25.289 --> 01:05:26.150]  Absolutely.
[01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:28.410]  He never even talked about immigration.
[01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:31.511]  The thing that brought him to the dance, he never even talked about.
[01:05:31.531 --> 01:05:35.752]  Number two, he's got to understand that he has a plan.
[01:05:37.072 --> 01:05:48.439]  Beat, soundly, Alex, 16 of the best and the brightest of the Republican Party, senators, governors, including a brain surgeon, an actual brain surgeon.
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:50.981]  He didn't go out there slamming Hillary Clinton.
[01:05:51.301 --> 01:05:54.603]  He gave them a vision and he talked about basically a couple of things.
[01:05:55.083 --> 01:05:58.846]  Illegal immigration and the sense of crime and losing.
[01:05:59.146 --> 01:06:02.168]  I would teach Donald Trump like a kata.
[01:06:02.848 --> 01:06:03.148]  I don't know.
[01:06:23.616 --> 01:06:33.064]  All you millennials, by the way, who were hosed by Bernie Sanders, who aren't necessarily going to vote for Hillary Clinton out of default, but who have been completely abandoned by this corrupt and venal system.
[01:06:33.424 --> 01:06:35.466]  I want to talk to you about this thing called whitewater.
[01:06:35.826 --> 01:06:40.931]  Once upon a time, there was something so big that the governor of Arkansas went to prison and people were indicted.
[01:06:41.311 --> 01:06:49.336]  This makes you talk about Atlantic City, where the city went bankrupt, where we have casinos and Revel and Wynn and this.
[01:06:49.756 --> 01:06:53.258]  You're talking about, I have 400 corporations, five went bankrupt.
[01:06:53.458 --> 01:06:54.779]  Let's look at Mitt Romney's.
[01:06:55.019 --> 01:06:57.681]  Folks, bankruptcy is not the issue.
[01:06:57.781 --> 01:07:03.464]  Now, when she brings up Trump University, pray to God she brings it up.
[01:07:03.504 --> 01:07:05.265]  Say, I'm glad you brought that up.
[01:07:05.765 --> 01:07:08.107]  I want to talk about something called Laureate.
[01:07:08.487 --> 01:07:21.049]  When you talk about how he's fat shaming a 90-whatever, some type of a beauty pageant contestant, I want to talk about sexual predation.
[01:07:22.188 --> 01:07:29.857]  Not Eleftherio, not somebody who's a skirt chaser, not somebody, but somebody who is a sexual predator.
[01:07:30.097 --> 01:07:35.764]  Now, remember, Bill Cosby, when people said, you know, that happened a long time ago.
[01:07:35.844 --> 01:07:36.364]  Who cares?
[01:07:36.625 --> 01:07:37.265]  It doesn't matter.
[01:07:37.586 --> 01:07:39.408]  Yeah, but you know, that was 40 years ago.
[01:07:39.548 --> 01:07:40.229]  It doesn't matter.
[01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:42.810]  Nobody blamed Bill Cosby's wife.
[01:07:43.231 --> 01:07:47.693]  They're looking at Hillary as the innocent spouse.
[01:07:48.074 --> 01:07:59.821]  When you are the Secretary of State and you can't say, give me the money, pay me the money and I'll give you most favored nation status or arms or whatever, you can't do that.
[01:08:00.321 --> 01:08:06.065]  What she did was, I'll tell you what, pay the Clinton Foundation.
[01:08:06.745 --> 01:08:08.086]  That's the connection.
[01:08:08.626 --> 01:08:09.447]  That's the nexus.
[01:08:12.714 --> 01:08:16.437]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle.
[01:08:16.457 --> 01:08:17.619]  There's a guy named Alex Jones.
[01:08:17.699 --> 01:08:18.579]  Alex Jones.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:19.560]  From Infowars.
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:20.261]  From Infowars.
[01:08:20.301 --> 01:08:20.501]  Yeah.
[01:08:20.621 --> 01:08:21.282]  Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.382 --> 01:08:22.183]  Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.243 --> 01:08:25.646]  One of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[01:08:25.706 --> 01:08:28.489]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[01:08:28.569 --> 01:08:33.293]  Claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[01:08:33.493 --> 01:08:38.136]  The conspiracy du jour, Hillary Clinton is harboring a secret medical condition.
[01:08:38.277 --> 01:08:40.318]  You just had to keep digging, didn't you, Alex?
[01:08:40.958 --> 01:08:43.480]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true!
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:54.668]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story that's according to website InfoWars.
[01:08:54.748 --> 01:08:57.010]  And this really just is so disgusting.
[01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:59.572]  The juice of these pickles is on you, Alex Jones.
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:05.921]  It goes right from Alex Jones, and it shows up in Donald Trump's mouth.
[01:09:05.961 --> 01:09:08.542]  Hillary Clinton created ISIS with Obama.
[01:09:09.082 --> 01:09:15.205]  The very fringe of the conspiracy movement, like Alex Jones, are being kind of incorporated into the campaign.
[01:09:15.265 --> 01:09:17.446]  If Trump gets elected, he's going to be Secretary of Defense.
[01:09:17.466 --> 01:09:19.546]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[01:09:19.626 --> 01:09:20.467]  Move, bitch!
[01:09:20.827 --> 01:09:21.947]  Get out the way!
[01:09:22.087 --> 01:09:24.088]  Bill Clinton is a rapist at Infowars.com.
[01:09:24.308 --> 01:09:25.509]  Bill Clinton's a rapist!
[01:09:27.069 --> 01:09:28.230]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:29.330]  Infowars.com.
[01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:30.430]  Infowars.com.
[01:09:30.530 --> 01:09:31.390]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:33.651]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[01:09:37.212 --> 01:09:41.153]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:09:41.753 --> 01:09:43.334]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:09:43.654 --> 01:09:47.795]  Now, here's the huge news on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:09:49.778 --> 01:09:52.839]  And it's out of Bloomberg, it's out of the Daily Caller, it's Associated Press.
[01:09:52.879 --> 01:09:56.559]  This is confirmed in the data dump, the latest by WikiLeaks.
[01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:08.242]  Just in, State Department is coordinating email release when the Clinton campaign had discussions with the DOJ.
[01:10:09.382 --> 01:10:18.924]  Again, that's Clinton with the DOJ and the State Department, an agency she's never been in, and another agency she formerly headed, getting directives from her.
[01:10:21.823 --> 01:10:22.543]  Totally illegal!
[01:10:23.243 --> 01:10:26.564]  And we've got the emails to the media, and emails to comedians, and all the rest of it.
[01:10:26.584 --> 01:10:27.025]  Now remember?
[01:10:28.625 --> 01:10:30.806]  Remember Debbie Washerman Schultz?
[01:10:34.467 --> 01:10:36.987]  And then you've got the new chair of the DNC.
[01:10:37.508 --> 01:10:39.608]  That's in the new emails that have come out.
[01:10:39.628 --> 01:10:44.650]  Remember she crippledly said, I've taken over to finish the job we started?
[01:10:44.670 --> 01:10:45.410]  They don't even hide it!
[01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:48.691]  They say to the public, of course the DNC wasn't rigged for Hillary.
[01:10:51.121 --> 01:11:01.270]  Then they say, of course it's rigged, and then we have the emails out of the New York Observer breaking DNC chief Donna Brazile leaked Sanders info to Clinton campaign.
[01:11:02.552 --> 01:11:04.654]  Of course, they were all in there working against him.
[01:11:04.914 --> 01:11:06.235]  They stole the delegates.
[01:11:06.475 --> 01:11:07.937]  They created the superdelegates.
[01:11:08.177 --> 01:11:08.938]  They admitted it.
[01:11:10.619 --> 01:11:13.522]  Sanders was winning by 70-80% in almost every state.
[01:11:13.582 --> 01:11:14.543]  It was ridiculous.
[01:11:14.583 --> 01:11:16.044]  He'd have 20,000 people, she'd have 100-200.
[01:11:18.387 --> 01:11:20.431]  She's got a couple hundred now when she has events.
[01:11:20.471 --> 01:11:23.838]  There's more people on the stage behind her than there are in front of her.
[01:11:26.564 --> 01:11:27.646]  And now one of our listeners...
[01:11:30.546 --> 01:11:32.267]  Got up behind yesterday, Hillary.
[01:11:32.287 --> 01:11:34.169]  She wasn't going to do any rallies, but she just showed up.
[01:11:34.609 --> 01:11:39.272]  Clinton suggests intervention for a protester wearing a Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[01:11:39.312 --> 01:11:40.953]  Now, for TV viewers, you can see this.
[01:11:41.013 --> 01:11:41.934]  Radio listeners, I'll describe it.
[01:11:41.954 --> 01:11:46.337]  First, we'll show the video shot on a cell phone of him right behind Hillary when he's taken up by the police.
[01:11:46.357 --> 01:11:55.404]  Then she says, we need to have a intervention out in the parking lot for this poor man.
[01:11:57.358 --> 01:11:58.700]  There's no way he could be deplorable.
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:02.864]  I mean, he's a black man and they belong to the party of the KKK.
[01:12:03.565 --> 01:12:05.047]  You're not getting off her plantation.
[01:12:05.507 --> 01:12:12.015]  So she says, after he's drug out by the police, and I thought the police were all evil, Hillary, but now you called on them to have him taken out.
[01:12:13.328 --> 01:12:16.511]  Imagine if we had a black man being taken out of a Trump rally for doing a disturbance.
[01:12:16.531 --> 01:12:16.711]  See?
[01:12:18.193 --> 01:12:20.415]  The media is like, what Jones is doing is so horrible doing this.
[01:12:20.655 --> 01:12:28.722]  You people at the DNC and George Soros sent folks in to be violent, it came out in the emails, and to blame Bernie Sanders.
[01:12:29.423 --> 01:12:31.305]  I'm not even doing a third of what you're doing.
[01:12:31.865 --> 01:12:33.386]  What I'm doing is legal and lawful.
[01:12:34.067 --> 01:12:34.888]  Ripped like $30,000 I gotta pay out now.
[01:12:36.789 --> 01:12:41.910]  It's bittersweet because we don't have a big extra budget, but I knew that they were going to come out and say that Trump was a racist.
[01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:42.730]  We knew this a year ago.
[01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:46.291]  I knew that they were going to come out and say that he was a rapist, all these R words.
[01:12:46.671 --> 01:12:51.192]  I knew he was going to pull all this, so we've just been attacking this whole thing with the truth.
[01:12:51.212 --> 01:12:57.813]  And I tell you, it's perfect timing with all the Bill Clinton rape stuff coming out.
[01:12:58.573 --> 01:13:02.094]  Oh, CNN says it's a conspiracy theory that
[01:13:03.331 --> 01:13:05.213]  Bill Clinton ever sexually assaulted women.
[01:13:05.433 --> 01:13:06.874]  He's settled cases.
[01:13:09.776 --> 01:13:12.538]  I've interviewed at least four women that say he raped them.
[01:13:15.301 --> 01:13:18.543]  I mean, these are women, like, in the governor's mansion, in the U.S.
[01:13:18.563 --> 01:13:18.904]  Capitol.
[01:13:19.404 --> 01:13:24.989]  I mean, he'll come in a cloakroom, lock the door, shove you up against the wall, and rape you.
[01:13:25.029 --> 01:13:27.431]  There it is, CNN panels, Bill Clinton sexual abusers are.
[01:13:28.331 --> 01:13:32.615]  Conspiracy theory, which the Clintons, again in their own emails, tell the media to say.
[01:13:34.053 --> 01:13:36.435]  Remember, it's a conspiracy theory that her email was even hacked.
[01:13:36.776 --> 01:13:37.937]  Remember just, what was it?
[01:13:39.078 --> 01:13:45.824]  Six, seven months ago, one of our reporters asked her about her email and said it was reportedly hacked, our source said.
[01:13:46.144 --> 01:13:49.307]  And she said, oh no, it was never hacked when she knew it was hacked.
[01:13:49.607 --> 01:13:50.408]  Notice it's all come out.
[01:13:50.628 --> 01:13:51.089]  She was hacked.
[01:13:51.129 --> 01:13:51.950]  It came out in July.
[01:13:52.510 --> 01:13:56.514]  Oh, something else we told you about, something else we had sources on that were correct.
[01:13:59.376 --> 01:13:59.917]  And we were told
[01:14:02.441 --> 01:14:03.061]  We're good to go.
[01:14:25.538 --> 01:14:26.639]  It's the exact words.
[01:14:27.219 --> 01:14:28.701]  I covered it like a bunch in the last hour.
[01:14:28.721 --> 01:14:29.742]  I'm going to give you the exact words.
[01:14:29.762 --> 01:14:30.922]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:14:31.243 --> 01:14:34.325]  How they want to keep us in a sleeping, sleeping state.
[01:14:34.846 --> 01:14:36.847]  Alright, let's start getting some clips, then right back to your phone calls.
[01:14:38.769 --> 01:14:39.690]  There's so many of these.
[01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:42.032]  Let's play Hillary on the intervention.
[01:14:50.179 --> 01:14:50.359]  So...
[01:15:11.863 --> 01:15:19.748]  You know, I do hope somebody follows that gentleman out and stages an intervention.
[01:15:19.768 --> 01:15:22.929]  He clearly has not been following this election very closely.
[01:15:25.931 --> 01:15:29.333]  Okay, so there are Infowarriors taking action, getting the info out.
[01:15:29.373 --> 01:15:31.254]  It's so funny, Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[01:15:31.294 --> 01:15:33.135]  Ha ha ha, let's have an intervention.
[01:15:33.576 --> 01:15:37.418]  Not for the rapists, not for all your crimes, not for you funding jihadis, but for him.
[01:15:38.752 --> 01:15:39.572]  Now let's go ahead.
[01:15:39.592 --> 01:15:40.293]  Big confidence game.
[01:15:40.313 --> 01:15:41.574]  She's up there smiling, you know.
[01:15:42.514 --> 01:15:43.134]  Notice of the debate.
[01:15:43.154 --> 01:15:44.235]  She had to sit down most of the time.
[01:15:45.736 --> 01:15:46.736]  Since I mentioned it, here it is.
[01:15:46.836 --> 01:15:54.140]  CNN panelist Bill Clinton's sexual abusers are conspiracy theorists and that ties into this huge new bombshell.
[01:15:54.881 --> 01:15:57.082]  New York City Democratic Election Commissioner.
[01:15:57.122 --> 01:15:59.083]  This isn't a commission member.
[01:15:59.123 --> 01:16:06.747]  This is the commissioner at a Democratic Party gala bragging about how they bus people around
[01:16:08.277 --> 01:16:09.978]  And have them vote at each polling place.
[01:16:10.679 --> 01:16:15.402]  What did Larry Nichols, who used to do this in Arkansas for the Clintons, say they do?
[01:16:15.842 --> 01:16:26.369]  They load a bunch of homeless people, they feed them the names of dead people or folks they know aren't voting, they walk them into Democrat-controlled precincts, and they vote over and over again, generally 10 times in a day.
[01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:32.413]  Takes 50-20 minutes to vote, then they drive you to another place, they feed you meals, and they give you $50 to $100.
[01:16:34.174 --> 01:16:35.335]  Sometimes they give people liquor.
[01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:42.313]  Remember what happened with Veritas, Project Veritas that got this as well, James O'Keefe?
[01:16:42.574 --> 01:16:46.377]  When they walk into Akron and go, I'm running child sex, sex slaves, how do I do that?
[01:16:46.817 --> 01:16:49.279]  Oh, well, just make sure you pay your taxes and you can run that sex slave.
[01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:51.301]  Let us help you shut that up right now.
[01:16:53.663 --> 01:16:55.325]  And they went into facility after facility.
[01:16:55.365 --> 01:16:56.606]  This is what we're dealing with.
[01:16:58.207 --> 01:17:00.109]  Are people that are just, it's just lawlessness.
[01:17:00.690 --> 01:17:01.670]  And it's just out in the open.
[01:17:02.291 --> 01:17:04.453]  And this guy is just talking about it like it's no big deal.
[01:17:04.493 --> 01:17:05.534]  This is the head of it.
[01:17:07.438 --> 01:17:10.340]  But first, Bill Clinton's sexual abusers are conspiracy theorists.
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.160]  CNN, here it is.
[01:17:12.621 --> 01:17:19.985]  So, Jackie, the irony is that with Bill Clinton you have him never acknowledging any of those allegations.
[01:17:20.025 --> 01:17:25.347]  You had Donald Trump in his own words, you know, admitting that he had done the kinds of things he's accusing Clinton of.
[01:17:26.468 --> 01:17:32.191]  Does that work with anybody outside the people who will never vote for anyone but Trump?
[01:17:32.813 --> 01:17:33.013]  No.
[01:17:35.274 --> 01:17:36.914]  Bill Clinton is not on the ballot.
[01:17:37.514 --> 01:17:39.655]  Hillary Clinton is on the ballot.
[01:17:40.235 --> 01:17:46.876]  A lot of the things Trump says about the 90s, about Bill Clinton, come straight out of conspiracy theory land.
[01:17:47.637 --> 01:17:49.817]  Things that are in Ed Klein's book.
[01:17:50.097 --> 01:17:52.018]  Things that Roger Stone says.
[01:17:52.778 --> 01:17:55.419]  So, no, I don't think it matters.
[01:17:57.959 --> 01:17:58.919]  She was co-president.
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:17:59.640]  That's admitted.
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:00.840]  Now she's going to be back in.
[01:18:02.748 --> 01:18:03.949]  They vacation with the Bushes.
[01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:10.935]  She is the bimbo eruption expert that went out and suppressed the women, just like Behar is bullying them, calling them tramps.
[01:18:11.955 --> 01:18:12.776]  You guys are shameful.
[01:18:15.658 --> 01:18:19.121]  Trump, in an edited tape, shot his mouth off about how women were throwing themselves on him.
[01:18:19.321 --> 01:18:20.162]  He could do whatever he wanted.
[01:18:20.202 --> 01:18:22.144]  He wasn't saying, I'm going out and assaulting women.
[01:18:22.164 --> 01:18:23.365]  He said, they throw themselves on you.
[01:18:23.545 --> 01:18:25.046]  You can just do that and they don't even care.
[01:18:25.426 --> 01:18:26.747]  And it's untasteful.
[01:18:26.807 --> 01:18:27.288]  I don't like it.
[01:18:28.166 --> 01:18:32.748]  But we're dealing with the Clintons here, who absolutely hate him, and the whole world government, for a good reason.
[01:18:35.469 --> 01:18:37.950]  Now let's start playing part of this Project Veritas piece.
[01:18:37.970 --> 01:18:38.911]  The full things on InfoWars.com.
[01:18:38.931 --> 01:18:40.231]  We'll go out to break here in a minute and a half.
[01:18:41.212 --> 01:18:47.695]  New York City Democratic Election Commissioner, Alan Skuckalin, how do you pronounce that?
[01:18:48.735 --> 01:18:54.858]  Is caught on camera at the United Federation of Teachers holiday party admitting there is widespread voter fraud in New York City.
[01:18:54.878 --> 01:18:55.158]  Here it is.
[01:18:55.178 --> 01:18:56.739]  I think there's a lot of voter fraud.
[01:18:58.035 --> 01:18:59.436]  Right.
[01:18:59.456 --> 01:19:06.599]  Like I say, people don't realize, certain neighborhoods in particular, they bus people around to vote.
[01:19:06.639 --> 01:19:07.239]  They do what?
[01:19:07.459 --> 01:19:09.100]  They bus them around.
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:12.001]  They put them in a bus, they go from poll site to poll site.
[01:19:12.061 --> 01:19:13.642]  Like what kind of neighborhoods?
[01:19:13.702 --> 01:19:15.723]  Oh, I don't want to say.
[01:19:19.084 --> 01:19:20.005]  That's Alan Skulkin.
[01:19:23.809 --> 01:19:24.250]  I don't know.
[01:19:48.245 --> 01:19:49.748]  No, you can't.
[01:19:49.989 --> 01:19:52.535]  You cannot ask.
[01:19:52.956 --> 01:19:54.459]  They can't ask for voter ID.
[01:19:54.479 --> 01:19:54.960]  The law.
[01:20:08.434 --> 01:20:18.477]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:20:18.557 --> 01:20:26.620]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:31.663]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:21:09.507 --> 01:21:15.631]  Hey Chelsea, has your mother ever told you that you're the daughter of Webb Hubble and not Bill Clinton?
[01:21:24.335 --> 01:21:36.525]  In the second presidential debate, Donald J. Trump came out and really called out Bill Clinton for his rapes, and how Hillary Clinton enabled him and helped cover it up, and also threatened people in the process.
[01:21:36.765 --> 01:21:39.687]  Now we have an article by Breitbart.com, exclusive video!
[01:21:39.907 --> 01:21:44.451]  Clinton's defenders, these are crimes terrified of enabler Hillary.
[01:21:44.631 --> 01:21:58.781]  In an exclusive video interview at the presidential suite of the historic Watergate Hotel, the victims of Bill Clinton's alleged sexual assault, Juanita Broderick, Kathleen Wiley, and Paula Jones, got together for the first time in person to express their personal fear of Hillary Clinton.
[01:21:58.921 --> 01:22:02.944]  And to warn voters that Clinton does not stand for women's issues.
[01:22:03.304 --> 01:22:05.446]  Something we've been saying since day one.
[01:22:05.546 --> 01:22:07.007]  She doesn't care about you women.
[01:22:07.167 --> 01:22:07.427]  Why?
[01:22:07.467 --> 01:22:08.528]  Because she's a pander.
[01:22:08.688 --> 01:22:09.789]  She gets rapists off.
[01:22:09.909 --> 01:22:11.090]  She lives with a rapist.
[01:22:11.150 --> 01:22:12.411]  She enables rapists.
[01:22:12.711 --> 01:22:14.032]  So, on November 8th,
[01:22:14.312 --> 01:22:20.560]  Make sure you get up off your couch and go and vote for the man who will make America great again.
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:23.764]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[01:22:24.104 --> 01:22:29.911]  Hillary Clinton has an unusually close relationship with top female aide, Huma Abedin.
[01:22:30.532 --> 01:22:33.215]  But does Huma have ties to the Muslim Brotherhood?
[01:22:34.076 --> 01:22:38.521]  Find out in The Clinton's War on Women in stores now.
[01:22:38.942 --> 01:22:43.327]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[01:22:43.427 --> 01:22:54.360]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:59.442]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[01:22:59.562 --> 01:23:02.064]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[01:23:02.124 --> 01:23:03.624]  It helps detoxify.
[01:23:03.844 --> 01:23:06.686]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[01:23:06.726 --> 01:23:11.468]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[01:23:11.508 --> 01:23:17.731]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[01:23:17.771 --> 01:23:23.073]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[01:23:23.193 --> 01:23:23.854]  I'm taking it now.
[01:23:24.814 --> 01:23:25.535]  This is so key.
[01:23:25.795 --> 01:23:30.077]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[01:23:30.117 --> 01:23:32.198]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[01:23:32.339 --> 01:23:35.801]  Exclusively available at Infowarslive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:23:39.136 --> 01:23:41.818]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see I told you so.
[01:23:42.019 --> 01:23:45.081]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[01:23:45.421 --> 01:23:46.162]  Because it's already here.
[01:23:46.562 --> 01:23:47.203]  It's being announced.
[01:23:47.583 --> 01:23:51.046]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[01:23:51.466 --> 01:23:53.388]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:23:53.508 --> 01:23:55.069]  A new battleship in the fight.
[01:23:55.249 --> 01:23:56.270]  InfoWars Live.
[01:23:56.430 --> 01:23:57.271]  Available right now.
[01:23:57.551 --> 01:23:58.892]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[01:23:59.333 --> 01:24:01.735]  You gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[01:24:02.415 --> 01:24:03.336]  Or you gonna be part of history?
[01:24:03.896 --> 01:24:06.919]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[01:24:07.399 --> 01:24:07.980]  Take action!
[01:24:23.149 --> 01:24:25.650]  So, it's a conspiracy theory, huh, that there's election fraud.
[01:24:25.670 --> 01:24:32.234]  It doesn't exist, but now they've got to federalize the elections to stop the Russians and Alex Jones and Trump stealing it.
[01:24:32.694 --> 01:24:39.477]  Well, Mr. Skorkin, who is the election commissioner in New York, I'm not saying he's involved in fraud, I'm saying the Democrats he's talking about are.
[01:24:40.117 --> 01:24:44.440]  And he's admitting he thinks you should have to have an ID and there's total fraud going on, but he doesn't want to say it on camera.
[01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:45.980]  Well, you got caught on camera.
[01:24:47.241 --> 01:24:49.242]  And he goes into the fact that it's just over the top.
[01:24:51.161 --> 01:24:55.325]  Elections officials caught on video blasting de Blasio's ID program.
[01:24:55.845 --> 01:24:57.587]  Well, just admitting there's total election fraud.
[01:24:58.307 --> 01:24:59.288]  Total voter fraud.
[01:24:59.808 --> 01:25:06.774]  Now, you can say, well, retail fraud is individuals, but this is election fraud when you organize people in mass to engage in fraud.
[01:25:07.055 --> 01:25:08.896]  That is election fraud, not voter fraud.
[01:25:09.176 --> 01:25:10.437]  Voter fraud is one person.
[01:25:11.338 --> 01:25:22.582]  Election fraud is electronic or organized individuals with lists, so that's electronic too, of dead people or folks you know have not been voting in a while, but you vote in their stead and they don't know they're out voting for you.
[01:25:24.242 --> 01:25:25.783]  And it's happening all over the battleground states.
[01:25:26.203 --> 01:25:30.144]  Now, we're about to break some really, really big news here.
[01:25:31.404 --> 01:25:39.627]  I tell you, a lot of times with big news, I will choose to let another outlet put it out just because if I think they have more credibility on the subject, I will let them put it out.
[01:25:41.196 --> 01:25:49.947]  I've been sitting on this for a week and waiting for other folks, and it was going to be put out through somebody else, and then I was told it was being put out through someone else now, so we've been asked to go ahead and put it out.
[01:25:49.967 --> 01:25:51.629]  We're going to put it out at the start of the next segment.
[01:25:52.779 --> 01:25:56.982]  The article's going up on Infowars.com in the next minute, so you'll need to hit refresh.
[01:25:57.002 --> 01:26:00.244]  Then we're going to add some background to the story, but we're going to go ahead and put it out right now.
[01:26:01.064 --> 01:26:08.869]  And that is the untold story of Danny Williams, banished, who was told his whole life that Bill Clinton was his father.
[01:26:08.889 --> 01:26:16.294]  Bill Clinton sent $700 a month to him, sent him presents, told Hillary, shut up at the house, and told the mother, I'll have you put in prison if you don't stop doing this.
[01:26:17.395 --> 01:26:21.958]  And so this is the untold story of Danny Williams coming up.
[01:26:23.342 --> 01:26:30.324]  A little bit later in this hour, but the video will be posted in the next minute or two to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:26:30.344 --> 01:26:38.727]  We'll tweet it out at RealAlexJones and you will also want to obviously share this with others because they're going to try to probably take it down.
[01:26:39.488 --> 01:26:40.348]  In fact, it just went live.
[01:26:40.408 --> 01:26:42.609]  It went live so fast, I was told during the last break that
[01:26:43.905 --> 01:26:45.186]  Oh, that's the one from a few days ago, yes.
[01:26:45.526 --> 01:26:47.987]  Hillary Clinton had bills mixed race shunned, banished.
[01:26:48.387 --> 01:26:52.209]  African-American voters will go to Trump in droves after Clinton is exposed.
[01:26:52.610 --> 01:26:58.753]  I have another former chef of the Clintons who heard her calling black people the N-word.
[01:26:59.713 --> 01:27:08.578]  And again, I've only heard the N-word out of Democrats behind closed doors.
[01:27:08.638 --> 01:27:09.578]  It's like something they do.
[01:27:09.618 --> 01:27:10.419]  It's really weird.
[01:27:11.974 --> 01:27:13.796]  They'll say, hey, want some of these?
[01:27:14.036 --> 01:27:14.977]  And you learn stuff from them.
[01:27:15.837 --> 01:27:18.319]  I didn't know you called these nuts inward toes.
[01:27:19.821 --> 01:27:24.465]  Or you'll argue with some Democrat and they'll go, don't you talk to me like a... I mean, this has happened to me over and over again.
[01:27:24.685 --> 01:27:27.627]  Black Democrats, white Democrats, it's like, whoa!
[01:27:28.788 --> 01:27:30.550]  But I guess that's where the KKK came from.
[01:27:30.570 --> 01:27:33.132]  I just... Everything is so upside down.
[01:27:33.212 --> 01:27:34.793]  I just, I don't even know what to think anymore.
[01:27:36.114 --> 01:27:39.097]  I grew up so blind to the racism stuff because it just wasn't going on in my family.
[01:27:39.117 --> 01:27:39.757]  I mean, I just...
[01:27:40.848 --> 01:27:46.093]  That's the reason I'm so annoyed by it, by racist black people and Hispanics that say I'm bad because I'm white.
[01:27:46.514 --> 01:27:47.495]  It's just a mess.
[01:27:47.555 --> 01:27:48.316]  It's a total mess.
[01:27:48.976 --> 01:27:49.817]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:27:49.857 --> 01:27:55.623]  I'll get to all of this, but the Danny Williams is going up here in just the next few minutes to InfoWars.com.
[01:27:55.863 --> 01:27:59.206]  His statement on his father wanting to get to know Bill Clinton.
[01:28:00.245 --> 01:28:04.046]  You know, I don't think it's too much to ask somebody to show some kind of one of these.
[01:28:28.203 --> 01:28:30.064]  I mean, you have to show an ID for everything else.
[01:28:30.204 --> 01:28:33.007]  Right, you go into a building, you have to show your ID.
[01:28:33.047 --> 01:28:43.234]  Well, you're the Democratic, you're the Commissioner, you said, of the Democratic Election Commissioner, so if you think there's voter fraud and you think there should be voter ID, why don't people listen to you?
[01:28:43.334 --> 01:28:48.178]  I mean... Well, that's because the New York State Legislature makes the laws, I don't make the laws.
[01:28:48.218 --> 01:28:51.420]  And you're saying there's a lot of absentee ballot fraud, too.
[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:53.662]  Oh, there's thousands of absentee ballots.
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:57.401]  Yeah, but that's the thing.
[01:28:57.441 --> 01:29:00.384]  Hillary Clinton doesn't support voter ID laws.
[01:29:00.644 --> 01:29:01.485]  I know.
[01:29:01.986 --> 01:29:05.490]  That's why I'm not always crazy about everything the Democrats do either.
[01:29:13.171 --> 01:29:18.194]  Poll that claims Hillary 11 point ahead, run by Clinton ally, paid off by her super PAC, but that's nothing.
[01:29:18.394 --> 01:29:19.554]  Look at this little sweetie pie.
[01:29:19.934 --> 01:29:20.555]  New York Times.
[01:29:20.935 --> 01:29:24.737]  Early voting could hand election to Hillary Clinton well before November 8th.
[01:29:24.777 --> 01:29:25.517]  This does two things.
[01:29:26.017 --> 01:29:30.159]  It makes you think there's no hope, because she's now going to lose Florida, with no evidence they say.
[01:29:30.199 --> 01:29:32.581]  Preliminary info shows she's a little bit ahead.
[01:29:32.881 --> 01:29:34.782]  Yeah, all the absentee voting, all the dead people voting.
[01:29:35.864 --> 01:29:36.806]  The bus is driving around.
[01:29:37.307 --> 01:29:43.324]  So here's the perception he's losing and then gets you ready for the theft while in New York, Florida and other areas.
[01:29:44.577 --> 01:29:52.463]  All these absentee ballots just show up with all these names on them, magically stuffed by the Democratic Party machine that's famous for this.
[01:29:52.823 --> 01:29:57.566]  So how do we fight back against the theft of our republic in front of us in broad daylight?
[01:29:57.926 --> 01:29:59.307]  Stay with us, the Danny Williams info coming up.
[01:29:59.327 --> 01:30:02.089]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.010 --> 01:30:05.692]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.682 --> 01:30:16.768]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:30.360]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[01:30:31.301 --> 01:30:42.535]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[01:30:43.196 --> 01:30:49.163]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[01:30:49.904 --> 01:30:58.291]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[01:30:58.931 --> 01:31:07.098]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[01:31:09.724 --> 01:31:12.948]  Hey, it's another story by the Lord of the Flies, Hillary Clinton.
[01:31:13.008 --> 01:31:17.172]  Hillary worried about jihadists entering with refugees in private speech.
[01:31:17.853 --> 01:31:19.775]  I'm not loving it.
[01:31:19.935 --> 01:31:21.137]  Duh, we could have told you that.
[01:31:21.277 --> 01:31:25.642]  In a private 2000 speech, Hillary Clinton worried about the risk of jihadists entering Jordan.
[01:31:25.762 --> 01:31:29.483]  With legitimate refugees because they can't possibly vet all those refugees.
[01:31:29.543 --> 01:31:30.863]  Yeah, we know you can't vet them all.
[01:31:30.943 --> 01:31:36.924]  And yet you want to allow 55,000 Syrians to come in annually unvetted.
[01:31:37.024 --> 01:31:49.727]  But you're going to go to this private luncheon and tell them that it's probably a bad idea to take in refugees because of the fact there could be some extremists that get in there and then come over here to America and possibly chop off our heads.
[01:31:49.847 --> 01:31:51.427]  We've been saying that since day one.
[01:31:51.547 --> 01:31:52.608]  We need to secure the border.
[01:31:52.648 --> 01:32:00.471]  We need someone like Donald Trump to come in here and make America great again, because the Clintons have done nothing but fail their entire political career, and I'm sick and tired of it.
[01:32:00.511 --> 01:32:04.974]  So November 8th, get your butt to the polls, go out there, vote, make America great again.
[01:32:05.014 --> 01:32:06.114]  Let's secure those borders.
[01:32:06.234 --> 01:32:09.316]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[01:32:10.116 --> 01:32:11.777]  I'm going to lay it out short and sweet.
[01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:19.254]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[01:32:19.955 --> 01:32:23.938]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[01:32:24.798 --> 01:32:27.040]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:28.281]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[01:32:28.961 --> 01:32:32.824]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat, or more.
[01:32:32.924 --> 01:32:34.845]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[01:32:35.366 --> 01:32:40.289]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22, when I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[01:32:40.389 --> 01:32:42.151]  It's actually scary.
[01:32:43.031 --> 01:32:53.136]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[01:32:54.117 --> 01:33:06.904]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.
[01:33:11.207 --> 01:33:13.088]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[01:33:13.148 --> 01:33:15.029]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[01:33:15.109 --> 01:33:17.831]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.051 --> 01:33:18.791]  Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.871 --> 01:33:19.892]  His name is Alex Jones.
[01:33:19.952 --> 01:33:22.833]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:33:23.053 --> 01:33:26.275]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.355 --> 01:33:28.296]  Alex Jones, the nut job radio guy.
[01:33:28.316 --> 01:33:29.857]  Talk show host Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.917 --> 01:33:35.240]  A man who trades in such sinister conspiracy theories, you have to wonder if he really believes half of what he says.
[01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:37.621]  I'm here to warn people, you keep telling me to shut up!
[01:33:37.921 --> 01:33:38.783]  This isn't a game!
[01:33:38.883 --> 01:33:39.584]  Hate speech.
[01:33:39.825 --> 01:33:41.829]  Can anything be done to stop the hatred?
[01:33:41.849 --> 01:33:46.197]  I think Alex was the one who took the pro-gun position.
[01:33:46.217 --> 01:33:47.720]  1776 will commence again if you protest!
[01:33:50.322 --> 01:33:52.122]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[01:33:52.302 --> 01:33:53.863]  Alex Jones is a 9-11 truther.
[01:33:54.043 --> 01:33:57.203]  That conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy theories.
[01:33:57.343 --> 01:33:59.824]  It's an internet talk show called Info Wars.
[01:34:00.004 --> 01:34:02.244]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[01:34:02.725 --> 01:34:05.485]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true!
[01:34:05.505 --> 01:34:08.206]  They're making some very serious allegations against the U.S.
[01:34:08.246 --> 01:34:12.987]  government, saying that they stage attacks, they allow them to occur in the United States against U.S.
[01:34:13.007 --> 01:34:13.927]  citizens.
[01:34:14.027 --> 01:34:15.547]  Alex Jones may sound crazy.
[01:34:15.787 --> 01:34:18.228]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[01:34:18.268 --> 01:34:19.408]  That man's a threat to this country.
[01:34:19.688 --> 01:34:21.050]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[01:34:21.090 --> 01:34:22.391]  Deeply, I think, racist.
[01:34:22.471 --> 01:34:23.933]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[01:34:23.953 --> 01:34:25.955]  He's considered legit among the crazy.
[01:34:26.195 --> 01:34:32.161]  Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally, and pop him.
[01:34:32.382 --> 01:34:33.082]  I'd love to see that.
[01:34:33.823 --> 01:34:34.504]  In uniform.
[01:34:35.865 --> 01:34:39.229]  Keep shoving lies at your audience, jackasses.
[01:34:39.249 --> 01:34:41.131]  I like that guy.
[01:34:57.406 --> 01:34:59.569]  We have gangsters running this country.
[01:34:59.910 --> 01:35:00.471]  Criminals!
[01:35:00.631 --> 01:35:01.132]  Gangsters!
[01:35:01.172 --> 01:35:03.976]  The bigger this war gets, the more freedoms we lose.
[01:35:06.847 --> 01:35:09.948]  We have a fog that has descended upon our entire nation.
[01:35:10.008 --> 01:35:12.169]  The globalists are going to blow stuff up and blame it on you.
[01:35:12.209 --> 01:35:14.149]  But Hillary's the one who runs the cover-up.
[01:35:14.349 --> 01:35:19.491]  Everything you've heard us talk about is now going to unfold in triplicate spades.
[01:35:20.211 --> 01:35:20.971]  It's as real as it gets.
[01:35:21.351 --> 01:35:24.752]  I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face, it's over for me.
[01:35:24.772 --> 01:35:26.313]  He said, Matt, it's over for you.
[01:35:26.333 --> 01:35:28.493]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[01:35:28.794 --> 01:35:29.994]  You're out of there.
[01:35:30.014 --> 01:35:31.334]  You want it, baby?
[01:35:31.614 --> 01:35:33.215]  You're about to get it.
[01:35:39.884 --> 01:35:47.926]  We did meet the British at Concord Bridge to serve tea, be tolerant, and see how many guns or what kind of guns they came to take.
[01:35:48.306 --> 01:35:52.867]  We met them at Concord Bridge, and we blew their punk-ass brains out.
[01:35:53.227 --> 01:36:05.230]  InfoWars has been able to break every record, infiltrate every operation, blow the criminal cover of operatives more than any other institution out there of freedom, and I'm so proud of that.
[01:36:05.410 --> 01:36:08.693]  The notion that Hillary has somehow been an advocate for women.
[01:36:08.713 --> 01:36:13.778]  No, Bill rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[01:36:13.798 --> 01:36:23.587]  I hope the enemies of this broadcast, when you lie about us, when you censor us, when you attack us, when you delist us, when you do that, you're signing on to the other side.
[01:36:23.807 --> 01:36:26.049]  These people are of the devil.
[01:36:26.089 --> 01:36:27.991]  Let's be very blunt about this.
[01:36:29.472 --> 01:36:31.653]  Tell and demand accountability.
[01:36:31.893 --> 01:36:36.235]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate, criminal government in American history.
[01:36:39.577 --> 01:36:44.679]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:36:45.459 --> 01:36:47.560]  The crowd is now moving forward toward the barrier.
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:52.342]  The police have been telling everybody they're going to shoot if we don't move back.
[01:36:52.462 --> 01:36:56.304]  Their defeat will be ultimately a crushing one.
[01:36:58.095 --> 01:36:59.376]  Alex Jones here in studio.
[01:36:59.396 --> 01:37:01.057]  We're halfway into this worldwide broadcast.
[01:37:01.077 --> 01:37:02.258]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:37:02.298 --> 01:37:06.080]  We have a guest joining us as well a little bit later in the next hour.
[01:37:06.741 --> 01:37:19.790]  Owen Troyer, Infowars.com reporter, who just got back from the debates the other night with incredible triggering of leftists and the fact that they have no common sense and were basically unable to defend their positions, except a few of them had to admit that
[01:37:20.350 --> 01:37:22.972]  They know Hillary Clinton covered up for Bill and is a predator and a criminal.
[01:37:23.733 --> 01:37:28.596]  It's just that Trump's a racist because he said all Mexicans are rapists.
[01:37:30.117 --> 01:37:37.062]  Isn't that interesting when he said a lot of criminals and rapists and robbers are coming over, just like criminals from the U.S.
[01:37:37.102 --> 01:37:37.723]  run to Mexico.
[01:37:38.423 --> 01:37:41.626]  He never said that, but this is how they operate, this is what they do.
[01:37:41.766 --> 01:37:45.669]  So, we're going to be breaking all of that down coming up, but first,
[01:37:47.165 --> 01:37:51.424]  Top story on DrudgeReport.com, Clinton's son speaks!
[01:37:54.031 --> 01:37:57.454]  And we're writing a larger article around this right now.
[01:37:57.594 --> 01:38:06.641]  We have been working with folks closely associated with Mr. Williams, and we're going to hold off until tomorrow with this.
[01:38:07.882 --> 01:38:11.125]  But there's a lot of things obviously going on and things afoot.
[01:38:11.945 --> 01:38:14.127]  And so we were told, drop the hammer now.
[01:38:14.287 --> 01:38:18.831]  So this was 10 minutes ago, talking to Williams and others, just to let you know that.
[01:38:19.371 --> 01:38:20.552]  And so, boom.
[01:38:21.713 --> 01:38:28.538]  This is his testimony, first ever seen, and it brings tears to my eyes.
[01:38:28.558 --> 01:38:40.367]  Because listen, when I go see a movie like Kill the Messenger about Gary Webb, who won all those big awards for exposing CIA drug dealing, who's been exonerated, it was nauseating.
[01:38:41.068 --> 01:38:44.470]  Because I knew him well, he was going to come on the show and break his new book.
[01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:46.191]  I was talking to him weeks before he died.
[01:38:46.352 --> 01:38:47.112]  I know they killed him.
[01:38:47.172 --> 01:38:48.093]  They shot him twice in the head.
[01:38:49.734 --> 01:38:50.775]  And the media said it was a suicide.
[01:38:52.830 --> 01:39:10.154]  So I mean, I've lived this, and I've lived 20 years ago having guests on about Danny Williams and the state police delivering $700 a month and Bill Clinton having Christmas presents delivered and Hillary coming and saying when he was a teenager, you know, you can't talk to Bill or get money anymore or I'll have you thrown in prison.
[01:39:11.374 --> 01:39:12.814]  So they've been speaking out since then.
[01:39:13.715 --> 01:39:15.855]  And it fits into all the other abused women and the rest of it.
[01:39:15.895 --> 01:39:17.455]  So I believe Mr. Williams' story.
[01:39:18.216 --> 01:39:19.736]  He looks like Bill Clinton.
[01:39:20.875 --> 01:39:29.177]  Bill Clinton is known to have a penchant for ladies across the board, and it fits into the entire paradigm.
[01:39:31.237 --> 01:39:33.117]  And so, this is important.
[01:39:33.517 --> 01:39:39.519]  Now, they famously, in a newspaper, all of the Democratic Party, claimed that they had supplied a DNA test in the mid-90s.
[01:39:40.859 --> 01:39:41.659]  They did not do that.
[01:39:42.319 --> 01:39:45.160]  Then they said, oh, here's a test, but then it wasn't a DNA test.
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:46.300]  It was just completely made up.
[01:39:47.113 --> 01:39:58.659]  So we're about to premiere this nine-minute video where his reported son, alleged son, Danny Williams, is trying to reconnect with his father, Bill Clinton.
[01:39:58.979 --> 01:40:00.600]  Banish the untold story of Danny Williams.
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:02.061]  Search for his father.
[01:40:03.121 --> 01:40:07.163]  He's a father himself, hard-working man, with a good record.
[01:40:09.504 --> 01:40:14.547]  And Black Lives Matter, unless you're Bill Clinton's illegitimate black son,
[01:40:17.395 --> 01:40:25.301]  This goes back to criticisms of Thomas Jefferson not making the kids he had with black ladies his kids.
[01:40:25.321 --> 01:40:27.803]  I guess he is William Jefferson Clinton.
[01:40:29.713 --> 01:40:30.333]  Not in a good way.
[01:41:00.635 --> 01:41:02.577]  Rape stare shot from the other night up there.
[01:41:02.697 --> 01:41:03.537]  Yeah, you've got that.
[01:41:03.617 --> 01:41:06.119]  You've got how he acts during his speeches.
[01:41:06.159 --> 01:41:10.483]  You've got even things that he's saying when he talks about Obamacare, about Hillary Clinton.
[01:41:11.303 --> 01:41:12.905]  It regularly happens where she faints.
[01:41:13.025 --> 01:41:14.666]  Oh wait, no, it's not a regular thing.
[01:41:15.267 --> 01:41:20.811]  We had that weird email he sent out where there's an acronym, a secret message on the side that says, stop her.
[01:41:21.211 --> 01:41:23.133]  So it's very strange what's going on with Bill Clinton.
[01:41:23.593 --> 01:41:29.077]  And this is kind of an approach that I take to all of this, Alex, that I don't understand why we wouldn't be seeing more of this.
[01:41:29.858 --> 01:41:31.399]  If you, I mean, this is huge.
[01:41:31.439 --> 01:41:36.122]  If someone's accusing me of having an illegitimate son that's false, guess what?
[01:41:36.162 --> 01:41:39.264]  I'm going to do everything I can to put that to rest immediately.
[01:41:39.344 --> 01:41:41.046]  I'll go do a DNA test right now.
[01:41:41.326 --> 01:41:42.587]  I'll meet with you right now.
[01:41:42.827 --> 01:41:44.648]  Let's clear the air on this right now.
[01:41:44.988 --> 01:41:46.869]  Complete silence from the Clinton campaign.
[01:41:47.230 --> 01:41:48.571]  Nothing from Bill Clinton on this.
[01:41:48.891 --> 01:41:59.478]  And I think that Donald Trump should bring Danny Williams to the next debate as his special guest if Clinton does not address this before then.
[01:42:00.078 --> 01:42:19.631]  Absolutely, trying to go over the thousand plus emails, and WikiLeaks is now actually releasing stuff that will get her indicted if there's any justice, where they are saying, he's given us a million bucks, we've got to shut down this nine billion dollar lawsuit, and then, okay, well, Chelsea's mad saying this is illegal, and it's Chelsea in here going, this is illegal, I don't want to do this, and they're like, shut up, brat.
[01:42:20.112 --> 01:42:21.693]  I mean, the other Democratic Party operatives
[01:42:22.577 --> 01:42:23.158]  It's all there.
[01:42:23.578 --> 01:42:28.104]  And then Democratic, high-level Democratic Party meetings where they're saying, the public's starting to wake up.
[01:42:28.385 --> 01:42:29.446]  We gotta keep them in the dark.
[01:42:29.526 --> 01:42:30.848]  I mean, this is powerful stuff.
[01:42:31.068 --> 01:42:39.239]  Yeah, and this Danny Williams thing is so powerful because it puts to rest, or I guess it even sheds a light on, all the double standards coming from the left.
[01:42:39.659 --> 01:42:42.841]  Specifically Hillary Clinton supporters, or Black Lives Matter.
[01:42:43.202 --> 01:42:48.926]  You know, Hillary Clinton, again, it's like she said multiple times, any woman who says that they've been sexually abused need to be heard.
[01:42:49.006 --> 01:42:50.347]  She ignores all of the other candidates.
[01:42:50.367 --> 01:42:56.292]  And then Joy Behar, getting the same talking points, calls them tramps, including a girl that was 12 years old, raped into a coma.
[01:42:57.423 --> 01:43:01.646]  And Hillary Clinton represented the guy knowing he was guilty and then told the little girl she was a liar and liked it.
[01:43:02.106 --> 01:43:03.447]  Now, we're going to go to this piece.
[01:43:03.507 --> 01:43:04.828]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:43:05.028 --> 01:43:07.730]  If you're a radio listener, you're going to hear the audio of Danny Williams.
[01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:13.653]  If you're a TV viewer at InfoWars.com forward slash show and cable and UHF stations that are picking this up, you can see it.
[01:43:14.013 --> 01:43:17.256]  But the video is at InfoWars.com.
[01:43:17.976 --> 01:43:20.578]  It went live just a little while ago on Danny Williams' new channel.
[01:43:22.839 --> 01:43:24.662]  We're about to premiere it here.
[01:43:25.102 --> 01:43:26.384]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[01:43:26.404 --> 01:43:27.565]  That's where it was first posted.
[01:43:28.803 --> 01:43:33.685]  And you can go see it, share it, get it out to folks, copy it to your channel, whatever.
[01:43:33.985 --> 01:43:35.385]  The point is we need to spread this.
[01:43:35.405 --> 01:43:36.966]  We need to put this on Facebook right now as well.
[01:43:38.686 --> 01:43:40.107]  So spread this to the four winds.
[01:43:40.187 --> 01:43:42.287]  It's the top link at DrudgeReport.com.
[01:43:42.307 --> 01:43:44.668]  That's the easiest place to find it and share it.
[01:43:45.168 --> 01:43:46.409]  We're going to play this in its entirety.
[01:43:46.449 --> 01:43:48.669]  Come back, comment on it, then go right to your calls.
[01:43:48.689 --> 01:43:53.991]  I know you've been holding, but we had to preempt you obviously callers for something this big happening today.
[01:43:54.011 --> 01:43:56.892]  And just to be clear, we've got a lot of background info we're about to publish as well.
[01:43:58.789 --> 01:43:59.409]  Talking to folks.
[01:43:59.449 --> 01:44:01.010]  I was told this was coming out today or tomorrow.
[01:44:02.671 --> 01:44:05.592]  Because I'm talking to these folks, but I'm obviously not in the mechanics of it all.
[01:44:05.812 --> 01:44:06.852]  They said, no, no, now's the time.
[01:44:06.872 --> 01:44:07.213]  Go ahead.
[01:44:07.253 --> 01:44:09.233]  So that's why we are putting this out there.
[01:44:09.934 --> 01:44:10.954]  I didn't want to scoop anybody.
[01:44:10.994 --> 01:44:17.677]  We were just told that we've been decided that of all the media and the Daily Mail and everybody else, World Net Daily, that they wanted to give it to us.
[01:44:17.857 --> 01:44:18.377]  So we're doing it.
[01:44:19.118 --> 01:44:20.458]  And so we're just following his wishes.
[01:44:22.239 --> 01:44:23.239]  Mr. Williams, let's put it out.
[01:44:23.439 --> 01:44:24.560]  We're putting it out right now.
[01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:28.662]  Here it is premiered at Infowars.com and DrugsReport.com.
[01:44:28.702 --> 01:44:29.002]  Here it is.
[01:44:31.703 --> 01:44:32.643]  Banished is the name.
[01:44:33.523 --> 01:44:34.644]  That's the story of Danny Williams.
[01:44:34.664 --> 01:44:38.986]  I have no doubt that I am Bill Clinton's son.
[01:44:39.866 --> 01:44:42.347]  There was common knowledge everyone in Arkansas knew.
[01:44:43.544 --> 01:44:44.444]  Everywhere I went, they pointed.
[01:44:44.464 --> 01:44:45.745]  That's Bill Clinton's son right there.
[01:44:45.805 --> 01:44:47.225]  He look like him, don't he?
[01:44:47.265 --> 01:44:52.767]  The ears, the mouth, the chin, the teeth, the eyes, the nose.
[01:44:52.867 --> 01:44:54.887]  I see him in me.
[01:44:54.927 --> 01:44:56.928]  You can see a black Bill Clinton.
[01:44:57.588 --> 01:45:01.830]  When I brush my hair, I can see Bill Clinton with waves in his head.
[01:45:04.131 --> 01:45:07.453]  I always felt bad about him not wanting to be in my life.
[01:45:08.033 --> 01:45:09.514]  Was it because I was black?
[01:45:09.554 --> 01:45:11.035]  Was it something wrong with me?
[01:45:11.115 --> 01:45:13.357]  Why he don't want to be a part of me?
[01:45:14.057 --> 01:45:18.019]  It made me think of even sometimes suicide.
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:19.981]  It's not fair.
[01:45:20.641 --> 01:45:21.722]  And it has been hurtful.
[01:45:22.362 --> 01:45:25.084]  That he still refused to acknowledge me.
[01:45:26.024 --> 01:45:27.545]  What time was very hard.
[01:45:28.345 --> 01:45:30.247]  And my mom was a working girl on the streets.
[01:45:30.927 --> 01:45:32.148]  She was heavy on drugs.
[01:45:33.450 --> 01:45:35.151]  My name is Lucia Ballantine.
[01:45:35.871 --> 01:45:37.491]  My sister's father ain't gonna leave you.
[01:45:37.531 --> 01:45:40.472]  She was just dead when he was my age.
[01:45:40.492 --> 01:45:44.133]  She was a prostitute and she, you know, hung around on the streets.
[01:45:44.233 --> 01:45:46.814]  I was seven, eight, or nine when she met him on the streets.
[01:45:47.915 --> 01:45:50.195]  I was told that she was with him on 13 occasions.
[01:45:50.215 --> 01:45:58.558]  Yeah, like, I don't know, about five or six months after, you know, David and everything, because she was pregnant.
[01:46:00.851 --> 01:46:04.935]  My mom went to prison and lost custody of us.
[01:46:05.035 --> 01:46:08.499]  My Aunt Lucille stepped up and gained guardianship of us.
[01:46:08.839 --> 01:46:10.381]  She raised us in Little Arkansas.
[01:46:10.841 --> 01:46:15.005]  At the time we was from group home to house to house.
[01:46:15.586 --> 01:46:19.209]  My Aunt Lucille wanted to have a father in my life.
[01:46:20.191 --> 01:46:22.572]  As a small child, she took me to the governor mansion.
[01:46:22.992 --> 01:46:25.593]  There was a car coming at the front gate, right?
[01:46:26.114 --> 01:46:27.454]  And the gate swings open.
[01:46:28.195 --> 01:46:30.396]  I ran up in there and ran behind the gate.
[01:46:30.976 --> 01:46:31.116]  Okay?
[01:46:31.316 --> 01:46:34.938]  She was trying to get him to accept me and notice me.
[01:46:34.958 --> 01:46:40.120]  When I got to the door, I asked for her, and the door was slammed in my face.
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:41.801]  They slammed the door in her face.
[01:46:42.721 --> 01:46:43.621]  This is Bill's son.
[01:46:43.642 --> 01:46:44.882]  He had the black son out here.
[01:46:44.902 --> 01:46:48.804]  And she was real nice, taking him off the side of the place.
[01:46:49.605 --> 01:46:51.847]  Hillary, she had guys chase him off the property.
[01:46:58.474 --> 01:46:59.254]  I read history.
[01:46:59.535 --> 01:47:01.497]  It basically goes back to slave owners.
[01:47:02.157 --> 01:47:07.162]  When they have a child with one of their slaves and the wives try to have him banished off the plantation.
[01:47:07.783 --> 01:47:08.744]  What century is this?
[01:47:09.044 --> 01:47:09.945]  It just wasn't right.
[01:47:10.988 --> 01:47:13.349]  Every child in this state is somebody.
[01:47:13.689 --> 01:47:16.790]  Because we're gonna give them every chance we can.
[01:47:16.810 --> 01:47:19.572]  And honestly, we were needing child support at the time.
[01:47:19.632 --> 01:47:20.772]  My mom was in prison.
[01:47:21.412 --> 01:47:23.033]  We was poor, okay?
[01:47:23.073 --> 01:47:24.033]  We had nothing.
[01:47:24.474 --> 01:47:26.615]  Who's gonna listen to us?
[01:47:27.075 --> 01:47:27.435]  Really?
[01:47:27.855 --> 01:47:29.676]  My aunt Lisa was working at a gas station.
[01:47:30.456 --> 01:47:33.837]  We have no money to pay no one to listen.
[01:47:34.058 --> 01:47:36.178]  They just shut us up.
[01:47:36.459 --> 01:47:39.780]  My mom told me on a few occasions where she was threatened.
[01:47:44.797 --> 01:47:48.339]  She was also pushed out a two-story window where she got a metal plate in her foot.
[01:47:48.899 --> 01:47:51.740]  To this day, she still feels scared of speaking.
[01:47:59.679 --> 01:48:04.424]  In fact, my mother did receive seven $100 bills a month in the mailbox.
[01:48:05.466 --> 01:48:09.650]  Even presents on Christmas that was delivered to my home by state troopers.
[01:48:10.431 --> 01:48:12.994]  So I felt he was trying to be a part of my life.
[01:48:13.254 --> 01:48:16.117]  And then when he became president, everything stopped.
[01:48:17.484 --> 01:48:24.610]  In 1995, when my father was President of the United States, the state of Arkansas put us in foster care.
[01:48:25.411 --> 01:48:26.812]  I lived in foster homes.
[01:48:27.612 --> 01:48:36.419]  It made me feel horrible because I know his child, Chelsea, was well taken care of and we was house to house, home read nights.
[01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:40.242]  And to know that my father was the President, it hurts.
[01:48:41.323 --> 01:48:46.788]  Try to imagine that your own father refused to love you.
[01:48:47.921 --> 01:48:50.666]  I refuse to say that you exist.
[01:48:51.869 --> 01:48:58.541]  Knowing who my father was, and that he was so close, yet so far away, made my pain unbearable.
[01:48:59.548 --> 01:49:07.115]  Growing up in Little Rock School District System, it was difficulties because you got gang members, drug activities at the schools.
[01:49:07.535 --> 01:49:08.876]  And I wanted more to life.
[01:49:08.956 --> 01:49:11.759]  I didn't want to end up dead in the streets for nothing.
[01:49:12.639 --> 01:49:15.862]  Moving from home to home, not having a stable place to go.
[01:49:15.882 --> 01:49:25.190]  It came to a point in high school where I had to drop out to take care of my little sisters and brothers and make sure they were stable and able to go to school every day.
[01:49:26.191 --> 01:49:31.598]  I got a job full-time at a donut shop my 11th grade year to support my sisters and brothers.
[01:49:32.199 --> 01:49:40.470]  If I had the love and support of my father that stayed on me, made sure I had the best education, I feel I would have had a better life.
[01:49:41.671 --> 01:49:48.497]  In 1999, they tried to sweep me under the rug with Bill Clinton's friend, publishing this phony DNA test.
[01:49:48.818 --> 01:49:50.239]  It never was a DNA test.
[01:49:50.499 --> 01:49:51.060]  Roger Altman.
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:53.662]  Roger is a longtime friend of mine.
[01:49:53.822 --> 01:49:54.683]  Just think about it.
[01:49:55.023 --> 01:49:58.906]  It was published in a tabloid owned by a donor of Bill Clinton.
[01:49:59.367 --> 01:50:00.328]  Even to this day.
[01:50:01.008 --> 01:50:06.750]  Megan Kelly, Howard Kirk, they continue to quote this bogus DNA test, and it really hurts.
[01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:09.550]  I would love to see the DNA test done.
[01:50:10.331 --> 01:50:13.512]  Several times, I tried to reach out to the clinics.
[01:50:14.152 --> 01:50:18.113]  People say all the time, you're gonna get yourself killed dealing with the clinics.
[01:50:19.494 --> 01:50:21.297]  I wrote letters to his library.
[01:50:21.598 --> 01:50:24.863]  I wrote letters to addresses I got off the internet.
[01:50:25.044 --> 01:50:29.411]  Even emailed him from Facebook on his Facebook pages.
[01:50:29.431 --> 01:50:31.314]  I never got any response back.
[01:50:32.532 --> 01:50:35.133]  Once in Little Rock, Arkansas, I visited the Clinton Library.
[01:50:35.473 --> 01:50:38.615]  I wanted to see how it felt to be in his presence, and he was speaking.
[01:50:39.275 --> 01:50:42.056]  But by the time we made it there, he was already gone.
[01:50:42.677 --> 01:50:53.402]  We took a tour through the library, and just to see all the things he'd done in the world, helping other kids in Haiti and, you know, all the other places, it just saddened me.
[01:50:53.902 --> 01:50:56.023]  Because I never received any help from him.
[01:50:57.527 --> 01:50:59.008]  Hillary started running for president.
[01:50:59.629 --> 01:51:01.990]  She visited Little Rock at one of her campaign stops.
[01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:04.992]  I put myself right in front of the podium where she spoke.
[01:51:05.252 --> 01:51:06.353]  She was looking right at me.
[01:51:06.373 --> 01:51:07.454]  Eye contact.
[01:51:14.557 --> 01:51:17.060]  From my heart, I was thinking she knew who I was.
[01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:21.264]  I met with a small group of the Black Lives Matter activists.
[01:51:21.364 --> 01:51:26.190]  It made me wonder, if she says Black Lives Matter, why I don't matter to her?
[01:51:26.830 --> 01:51:28.532]  And I just felt for them.
[01:51:28.552 --> 01:51:33.637]  I was going to introduce myself as Dani Williams, her husband's son and her stepson.
[01:51:34.431 --> 01:51:37.054]  You know, I am a new grandmother, in case you haven't heard.
[01:51:37.414 --> 01:51:40.577]  I had millions of questions to ask, you know, why?
[01:51:40.918 --> 01:51:44.201]  We're gonna do everything we can to make sure she has every opportunity.
[01:51:44.301 --> 01:51:46.864]  Soon as she spoke, she got out of there.
[01:51:46.884 --> 01:51:48.545]  I didn't get to talk to my stepmom.
[01:51:49.887 --> 01:51:52.369]  I could never imagine having a child and not acknowledge him.
[01:51:53.110 --> 01:51:56.353]  As I know how it feels to not have a parent in your life.
[01:51:57.294 --> 01:51:58.515]  I work construction.
[01:51:59.316 --> 01:52:00.497]  I am a person of faith.
[01:52:00.978 --> 01:52:02.739]  I take my kids to church every Sunday.
[01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:06.903]  I teach my sons how to keep bad language out your mouth.
[01:52:06.923 --> 01:52:10.447]  How to speak properly with yes sir and yes ma'am.
[01:52:11.107 --> 01:52:15.350]  Recently, I've been telling my kids that their grandfather was the President of the United States.
[01:52:15.871 --> 01:52:16.891]  And they amazed by it.
[01:52:16.911 --> 01:52:19.013]  They're like, no, you know, is it for real?
[01:52:19.033 --> 01:52:21.715]  I tell them, yes, you know, that is my father.
[01:52:21.975 --> 01:52:23.896]  And I'm gonna make sure you get to meet him one day.
[01:52:23.916 --> 01:52:29.640]  Hillary, please do not deny I exist.
[01:52:30.061 --> 01:52:31.101]  I am your stepson.
[01:52:31.322 --> 01:52:32.703]  Chelsea is my sister.
[01:52:33.203 --> 01:52:34.404]  And Bill is my father.
[01:52:35.373 --> 01:52:36.415]  Super predators.
[01:52:36.515 --> 01:52:37.857]  We have to bring them to heel.
[01:52:38.337 --> 01:52:43.085]  I felt bad when Hillary called black people super predators and that we need to be brought to heel.
[01:52:43.946 --> 01:52:44.487]  I'm black.
[01:52:44.967 --> 01:52:45.468]  I'm real.
[01:52:45.488 --> 01:52:50.596]  I am her stepson and I deserve the love that she has given Chelsea.
[01:52:51.522 --> 01:52:56.727]  We hear my stepmother tells the nation every day, we're stronger together.
[01:52:57.687 --> 01:52:59.809]  They know who I am, and I know who I am.
[01:53:00.270 --> 01:53:01.731]  I have to meet my father.
[01:53:02.171 --> 01:53:07.076]  I have to know that he's willing to even accept me.
[01:53:07.156 --> 01:53:15.043]  I have to know that he... Like any child, I want to know my dad, and I want him to know me.
[01:53:15.363 --> 01:53:16.864]  I'm his only son in the world.
[01:53:17.935 --> 01:53:19.156]  And he's my only dad.
[01:53:19.616 --> 01:53:20.877]  We have to come together.
[01:53:21.697 --> 01:53:22.298]  We have to.
[01:53:23.899 --> 01:53:27.561]  If black lives truly matter to you, please contact me.
[01:53:47.062 --> 01:53:48.703]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:53:48.723 --> 01:53:52.444]  It's the top story on DrugsReport.com.
[01:53:53.085 --> 01:53:56.246]  Clinton's son, in quotes, speaks.
[01:53:57.487 --> 01:54:00.808]  And I've talked to, on record and off record, to the state police.
[01:54:01.989 --> 01:54:05.890]  People, by the way, have been killed for sniffing around about this story and others, just so you know.
[01:54:06.971 --> 01:54:08.552]  So Mr. Williams, I think, is in danger.
[01:54:08.852 --> 01:54:09.612]  I think everybody is.
[01:54:09.652 --> 01:54:11.053]  These are very dangerous people.
[01:54:12.210 --> 01:54:15.611]  I came, I saw he died, and so did hundreds of thousands of people in North Africa.
[01:54:16.171 --> 01:54:16.931]  That's Hillary for you.
[01:54:17.891 --> 01:54:24.873]  And Joy Behar, you know, and The View are calling the rape victims and people tramps for daring to go to the debate.
[01:54:25.393 --> 01:54:31.075]  At the end of the clips that we have on InfoWars.com from The View a few days ago, yesterday morning, they
[01:54:32.366 --> 01:54:34.567]  Put a cherry on top and say, it doesn't matter.
[01:54:34.607 --> 01:54:37.268]  You know, Hillary would never have been with Bill if she knew about all this.
[01:54:37.828 --> 01:54:38.909]  She was in charge of it.
[01:54:38.949 --> 01:54:41.830]  She chose him because he was flawed and she could control him.
[01:54:42.110 --> 01:54:43.571]  She's always been the boss.
[01:54:46.972 --> 01:54:48.133]  She has him under control.
[01:54:48.153 --> 01:54:50.534]  That's why she didn't defend him the other night.
[01:54:50.554 --> 01:54:52.335]  People couldn't believe it because it's all true.
[01:54:52.355 --> 01:54:57.677]  So we're going to play a short
[01:54:58.789 --> 01:55:00.230]  Clip here of Joy Behar.
[01:55:00.250 --> 01:55:04.411]  Just to give you an idea of how they attack the victims and what they do.
[01:55:04.431 --> 01:55:04.811]  Here it is.
[01:55:05.371 --> 01:55:14.775]  That's why when he brought up these allegations, I wonder if she missed the opportunity to address it in a way that the public would understand.
[01:55:15.235 --> 01:55:17.676]  That that's just not how you behave.
[01:55:17.776 --> 01:55:22.878]  I would like to apologize to those tramps that have slept with my husband.
[01:55:23.198 --> 01:55:24.358]  Maybe she could have said that.
[01:55:26.263 --> 01:55:30.386]  And then the New York Times calls Donald Trump saying, women throw themselves at me, I'm such a big star.
[01:55:30.527 --> 01:55:32.188]  That's so narcissistic and arrogant, I don't like it.
[01:55:32.648 --> 01:55:34.470]  Trump said he's grown a lot the last 11 years, but whatever!
[01:55:35.050 --> 01:55:41.035]  You're not selling missile seekers to the Communist Chinese and putting jihadis in to kill 200,000 Christians and sell five-year-olds into sex slavery.
[01:55:41.375 --> 01:55:42.877]  They're not making failed states everywhere.
[01:55:42.897 --> 01:55:46.259]  They're not sleeping in the same room with a daughter of the woman that runs basically the...
[01:55:47.592 --> 01:55:49.053]  Feminine side of the caliphate.
[01:55:49.493 --> 01:55:51.274]  I mean, you cannot make this up.
[01:55:51.334 --> 01:55:55.056]  And all the new emails about keeping us in the dark, creating race war, creating division.
[01:55:55.276 --> 01:55:56.797]  Owen Schroer's riding a shotgun.
[01:55:56.817 --> 01:55:58.037]  I'm going to come back and take some of your calls.
[01:55:58.277 --> 01:56:02.580]  I had some big guests today, veterans that are here, with a movie coming out about battles that happen and stuff.
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:04.420]  But I've got to move them to the fourth hour.
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:06.101]  They're also being interviewed by Joe Biggs.
[01:56:06.121 --> 01:56:09.303]  But that's got to be preempted, invite them back, because just too much is breaking.
[01:56:09.643 --> 01:56:10.804]  This was supposed to break tomorrow.
[01:56:12.305 --> 01:56:14.006]  Uh, and again, I'm not even in the soup.
[01:56:14.106 --> 01:56:19.329]  I was just told they wanted me to have one of the exclusives because they, you know, Danny likes the show, has been in contact with Joe Biggs actually.
[01:56:19.349 --> 01:56:20.810]  He likes Joe Biggs' work and my work.
[01:56:21.290 --> 01:56:23.312]  And so this, and I just, I'm kind of a hands-off guy.
[01:56:23.372 --> 01:56:24.672]  If something falls in our lap, it does.
[01:56:24.792 --> 01:56:28.194]  I've known about the story 20 years since he was like 10 years old.
[01:56:28.254 --> 01:56:29.055]  Williams knows that.
[01:56:29.075 --> 01:56:32.437]  Uh, and so look for more exclusives tomorrow.
[01:56:32.497 --> 01:56:34.518]  I'm just going to leave it at that for you.
[01:56:35.919 --> 01:56:37.640]  What's more exclusive than a video of Danny Williams?
[01:56:38.857 --> 01:56:41.378]  Everybody can maybe do some math and what two plus two equals.
[01:56:41.978 --> 01:56:44.299]  But briefly, this is an expensive operation to run.
[01:56:44.339 --> 01:56:49.642]  We just sent Owen up there with a crew to cover the big debates and got huge coverage.
[01:56:49.662 --> 01:56:51.283]  Really important intel back to you and your family.
[01:56:51.523 --> 01:56:52.583]  We're your probe droids.
[01:56:52.623 --> 01:56:57.485]  We're out there around the world, around the country, ferreting, working, running around like madmen.
[01:56:59.426 --> 01:57:02.608]  And so, you know, a lot of folks say that Hillary works like a demon.
[01:57:02.628 --> 01:57:03.108]  Bill says that.
[01:57:03.128 --> 01:57:05.089]  Well, we work, we work like a
[01:57:06.886 --> 01:57:13.129]  I don't know, like dynamos around here, and I'm so proud of the crew and the work they're doing, and you the listeners that help us and support us with the info and more.
[01:57:13.169 --> 01:57:15.310]  So briefly, I'm going to throw this out to folks.
[01:57:16.451 --> 01:57:20.553]  We need your support, and we're ending a big special today.
[01:57:21.273 --> 01:57:23.594]  That's 23% off on our flagship product, DNA Force.
[01:57:24.255 --> 01:57:26.016]  Cleans out the cells, the mitochondria.
[01:57:26.216 --> 01:57:27.116]  You can actually say that.
[01:57:27.136 --> 01:57:29.357]  There's 175 studies just on BioPQQ.
[01:57:29.397 --> 01:57:30.398]  It's an amazing formula.
[01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:32.580]  It looks like it's expensive.
[01:57:33.161 --> 01:57:35.821]  Leading competitors are $400, $500, you know, four or five times this.
[01:57:36.902 --> 01:57:40.342]  Because just what's in a bottle costs $40 to $50 just for one of the ingredients.
[01:57:41.263 --> 01:57:44.124]  So our products usually have 60, 70, 80, 100% markup.
[01:57:44.364 --> 01:57:44.984]  That helps fund us.
[01:57:45.204 --> 01:57:48.845]  The average industry has a 3, 4, 5, or even 6 or 7 markup.
[01:57:49.625 --> 01:57:51.706]  So no one can get something like this because it'd be $600.
[01:57:52.026 --> 01:57:52.606]  We don't do that.
[01:57:53.516 --> 01:57:55.698]  Only place they sell things similar are at medical clinics.
[01:57:55.738 --> 01:57:58.740]  They're not prescription, but people won't spend that money unless it's a doctor.
[01:57:59.141 --> 01:58:01.783]  Only place you get the next level nutraceuticals is at a doctor's office.
[01:58:02.123 --> 01:58:04.165]  We've decided to just go after the high-end clinics.
[01:58:05.845 --> 01:58:10.647]  Offer stuff even better at one-third or one-fifth or one-sixth the price.
[01:58:11.187 --> 01:58:15.228]  Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:58:15.308 --> 01:58:17.429]  We can answer all your questions, take your order.
[01:58:17.469 --> 01:58:21.350]  Our new biome defense, amazing probiotics out, two different formulations.
[01:58:21.810 --> 01:58:24.171]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:24.711 --> 01:58:31.834]  We'll be right back with our number three, straight ahead with the Danny Williams October surprise breaking here.
[01:58:31.894 --> 01:58:32.394]  Stay with us.
[01:58:38.766 --> 01:58:44.413]  With only 27 fleeting days left until the election, we have entered the final countdown.
[01:58:44.433 --> 01:58:50.200]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:58:50.260 --> 01:58:51.662]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:51.682 --> 01:58:54.645]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:59:00.143 --> 01:59:06.325]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:59:06.705 --> 01:59:09.586]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:59:09.926 --> 01:59:15.107]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:59:15.527 --> 01:59:21.509]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:59:21.649 --> 01:59:24.770]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:59:24.930 --> 01:59:26.390]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[01:59:26.590 --> 01:59:30.734]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:59:30.914 --> 01:59:33.797]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:59:33.857 --> 01:59:35.438]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:59:35.538 --> 01:59:38.721]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:59:39.001 --> 01:59:41.324]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:59:41.604 --> 01:59:42.565]  It's in powder form.
[01:59:42.665 --> 01:59:45.367]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:59:45.547 --> 01:59:46.148]  I take this.
[01:59:46.268 --> 01:59:47.950]  This is the product that I take.
[01:59:48.070 --> 01:59:50.032]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[01:59:50.852 --> 01:59:51.633]  We fight the Globals!
[01:59:51.653 --> 01:59:52.513]  We fight the New World Order!

[01:59:57.077 --> 01:59:58.978]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:23.977 --> 02:00:28.103]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:37.868 --> 02:00:39.910]  All right, Owen Troyer is riding a shotgun with me.
[02:00:41.152 --> 02:00:43.614]  I had a couple great veteran Patriots coming in today.
[02:00:43.634 --> 02:00:45.576]  They're also going to be on the Nightly News with Biggs tonight.
[02:00:45.596 --> 02:00:49.981]  They may be in the fourth hour if they choose, but I got to preempt things right now because they'll understand how that happens.
[02:00:50.001 --> 02:00:52.003]  You know, operations get moved forward, they get moved backward.
[02:00:52.023 --> 02:00:56.207]  The whole Danny Williams thing has been percolating here for years.
[02:00:56.628 --> 02:00:57.168]  We've had Danny
[02:00:58.297 --> 02:00:59.258]  Contacting myself.
[02:00:59.298 --> 02:01:01.740]  Contacting Biggs.
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:02.781]  He works two jobs.
[02:01:02.821 --> 02:01:03.741]  He's got several kids.
[02:01:05.543 --> 02:01:08.125]  He's been with the same lady the whole time.
[02:01:09.106 --> 02:01:09.946]  Church guy.
[02:01:09.966 --> 02:01:10.567]  Whole nine yards.
[02:01:11.467 --> 02:01:12.608]  Just a really credible person.
[02:01:13.049 --> 02:01:14.630]  And I've been covering his story since he was 10 years old.
[02:01:16.191 --> 02:01:19.414]  And I've seen that Clinton's put out a fake DNA test.
[02:01:19.434 --> 02:01:20.314]  They got caught it was fake.
[02:01:20.334 --> 02:01:21.075]  That's in the article.
[02:01:21.095 --> 02:01:23.077]  I mean, this is amazing.
[02:01:25.313 --> 02:01:29.596]  They were having a whole bunch of other media hammer them to, you know, let us put it out first, let us put it out first.
[02:01:30.017 --> 02:01:31.958]  I sat back and I said, fine, let them put it out first.
[02:01:32.619 --> 02:01:33.299]  I don't care, that's fine.
[02:01:33.860 --> 02:01:36.081]  And then for some reason at the end they said, no, we want you to put it out first.
[02:01:36.101 --> 02:01:42.366]  And I don't want to obsess over that, I can just tell a lot of folks out there are going to get really pissed because this is like one of the big October surprises.
[02:01:43.147 --> 02:01:50.293]  And I don't know, I just, I'm chomping at the bit once I'm on air, but when it comes to stuff and hosts and people and breaking news, I kind of get, you know, just,
[02:01:51.113 --> 02:01:52.256]  Ice water in my veins.
[02:01:53.258 --> 02:01:54.801]  And that's how we continue to get the big stories.
[02:01:54.961 --> 02:01:55.863]  All I care about is...
[02:01:56.892 --> 02:01:58.173]  Getting justice for this young man.
[02:01:58.333 --> 02:01:59.954]  I believe he's Bill Clinton's illegitimate son.
[02:01:59.974 --> 02:02:03.717]  Clinton was known for banging every hooker in Little Rock, every hooker in Hot Springs.
[02:02:03.737 --> 02:02:06.078]  His real mother wasn't a nurse, she was a prostitute.
[02:02:06.539 --> 02:02:08.140]  He's probably a Rockefeller son.
[02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:11.402]  That's why the Kennedy visited with him and the Rockefellers helped him, why he cries.
[02:02:11.902 --> 02:02:17.746]  There's only two people believe I could be president when I was 16 years old and that was my mama and David Rockefeller.
[02:02:17.786 --> 02:02:20.068]  We can find out, David Rockefeller helped me.
[02:02:20.108 --> 02:02:22.149]  Thank you, David.
[02:02:22.169 --> 02:02:24.071]  We can find that tape.
[02:02:24.491 --> 02:02:25.632]  Bill Clinton thanks David Rockefeller.
[02:02:26.272 --> 02:02:28.993]  And of course, it was Governor Rockefeller that's his dad.
[02:02:29.013 --> 02:02:31.253]  It's just that Rockefeller took him under his wing.
[02:02:32.213 --> 02:02:36.594]  That's not the first time these big powerful robber barons have a bunch of illegitimate kids they put in positions of power.
[02:02:36.754 --> 02:02:37.534]  That's what you're supposed to do.
[02:02:37.934 --> 02:02:47.116]  Danny Williams got just thrown to the curb, but there's a lot of chief executives out there and powerful men that their right-hand guy when they're 75 is their 40-year-old son from a mistress.
[02:02:47.896 --> 02:02:50.917]  And it's a really trashy thing to throw your kid under the bus like that.
[02:02:50.937 --> 02:02:51.317]  What do you think?
[02:02:52.037 --> 02:02:55.320]  Well, I think, again, it's amazing that he just completely ignores it.
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:56.101]  That's the thing.
[02:02:56.261 --> 02:02:58.242]  I don't know why you wouldn't want to clear the record on this.
[02:02:58.543 --> 02:03:02.006]  And I think the reason why you say, oh, you know, I don't need to break this story.
[02:03:02.066 --> 02:03:02.606]  Maybe we can break it.
[02:03:02.646 --> 02:03:03.327]  It doesn't matter to you.
[02:03:03.347 --> 02:03:05.028]  But you already broke the story, Alex.
[02:03:05.068 --> 02:03:06.650]  You broke the story 10 years ago.
[02:03:06.670 --> 02:03:07.450]  You broke the story 20 years ago.
[02:03:08.291 --> 02:03:11.133]  It's the same thing with all of these email leaks that we're getting from WikiLeaks.
[02:03:11.153 --> 02:03:12.454]  Like, okay, this is great.
[02:03:12.855 --> 02:03:16.057]  Like, I mean, obviously, like, I mean, this is where the rubber meets the road.
[02:03:16.097 --> 02:03:16.898]  This is the proof.
[02:03:17.038 --> 02:03:18.019]  I mean, we got them.
[02:03:18.079 --> 02:03:19.099]  We caught them red-handed.
[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:20.581]  But we've been saying this for years.
[02:03:20.601 --> 02:03:22.762]  There's nothing in these emails that we didn't already report on.
[02:03:22.782 --> 02:03:25.084]  There's nothing in these emails that we didn't already try to tell you.
[02:03:25.484 --> 02:03:29.107]  So... It does confirm everything we've said and what Drudge has said and what World Net Daily said.
[02:03:29.147 --> 02:03:30.148]  And look at this.
[02:03:30.268 --> 02:03:33.470]  Diller, the big Democrat, Trump presidential run is an evil miracle.
[02:03:34.031 --> 02:03:34.992]  I've got a dark heart.
[02:03:35.672 --> 02:03:37.294]  We're evil, we're an evil miracle.
[02:03:37.374 --> 02:03:38.636]  No, that's who they are!
[02:03:38.656 --> 02:03:42.900]  I mean, did you see these emails where they're discussing, we gotta keep the public in the dark, they're starting to wake up?
[02:03:43.701 --> 02:03:45.323]  And Alex, what is their response?
[02:03:45.483 --> 02:03:48.667]  I have it in the video, at WashU, at the debate.
[02:03:49.128 --> 02:03:49.969]  What is their response?
[02:03:50.529 --> 02:03:51.190]  I don't care!
[02:03:52.270 --> 02:03:52.630]  Literally!
[02:03:52.930 --> 02:03:53.770]  They don't care!
[02:03:53.790 --> 02:03:58.211]  They don't care that their candidate has been caught talking bad about them.
[02:03:58.231 --> 02:04:00.792]  They don't care that their candidate got caught rigging the election.
[02:04:00.972 --> 02:04:03.133]  They don't care that their candidate gets away with breaking the law.
[02:04:03.153 --> 02:04:05.333]  I hear an audio of Trump saying, I hate the American people, I'm done.
[02:04:05.553 --> 02:04:07.314]  But no, the truth is, a lot of people have done it a long time.
[02:04:07.674 --> 02:04:15.856]  He gets really sentimental and weird around the American people and poor people and really wants to build prosperity.
[02:04:16.216 --> 02:04:20.557]  Well, I don't know if you happened to see any of his rally at Wilkes, Pennsylvania yesterday.
[02:04:21.425 --> 02:04:21.845]  Amazing.
[02:04:22.646 --> 02:04:23.026]  Amazing.
[02:04:23.527 --> 02:04:32.874]  I would say this to people, if you're on the fence, even if you don't like Donald Trump, if you watch that rally, it shows that this is not about Donald Trump.
[02:04:32.915 --> 02:04:34.896]  This truly is a movement.
[02:04:34.936 --> 02:04:36.217]  He's what we've been waiting for.
[02:04:36.257 --> 02:04:36.938]  I'm going to be honest.
[02:04:37.658 --> 02:04:38.959]  Ten years ago, I saw some of his shows.
[02:04:38.980 --> 02:04:41.401]  I thought he was an arrogant narcissist, probably a liberal.
[02:04:42.442 --> 02:04:44.204]  I don't like golden airplanes and all this stuff.
[02:04:44.244 --> 02:04:46.005]  I mean, I don't mind his hot wife or whatever.
[02:04:47.148 --> 02:04:48.569]  That's not my style, okay?
[02:04:49.689 --> 02:04:51.310]  And, I'm pretty conservative.
[02:04:51.810 --> 02:05:06.518]  But, the guy I've seen the last few years, and stuff he did even 20 years ago on Afton Gadd, there was a battle of two Trumps, and he's really transformed, and is touched by all this, and understands he's in history, and has become much more humble under the attack, and folks, he's gone through hell, too!
[02:05:06.838 --> 02:05:07.439]  Don't forget that.
[02:05:07.459 --> 02:05:07.999]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:10.825 --> 02:05:21.033]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[02:05:21.593 --> 02:05:33.242]  And others who are kind of at the very fringe of the conspiracy movement like Alex Jones are being kind of incorporated into the campaign in ways it's a or even the recent choices of campaign management.
[02:05:33.562 --> 02:05:38.686]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle as we've been chronicling here.
[02:05:38.726 --> 02:05:39.207]  Jones is the
[02:05:40.067 --> 02:05:43.848]  Conspiracy theorist and creator of the fringe website InfoWars.
[02:05:44.208 --> 02:05:47.248]  Do you also know that Hillary Clinton uses a wheelchair?
[02:05:48.308 --> 02:05:54.369]  Her personal vehicle has had to be outfitted with a wheelchair lift because she is not a person who can actually walk.
[02:05:55.150 --> 02:05:58.230]  She secretly uses a wheelchair all those times you think you've seen her walking.
[02:05:58.270 --> 02:05:59.190]  She hasn't been walking.
[02:05:59.410 --> 02:05:59.930]  Did you know that?
[02:06:00.791 --> 02:06:03.731]  Hillary Clinton has been on the campaign trail for 18 months.
[02:06:03.791 --> 02:06:06.372]  Her energy staggers me.
[02:06:07.092 --> 02:06:08.632]  I have a hard time keeping up with her.
[02:06:13.146 --> 02:06:17.688]  The historical first in electing the first conspiracy freak president.
[02:06:17.948 --> 02:06:19.429]  He's not pivoting for presidential.
[02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:21.270]  He's pivoting to Alex Jones.
[02:06:21.310 --> 02:06:22.631]  He's pivoting to crazy.
[02:06:23.131 --> 02:06:27.653]  Was Hillary wearing an earpiece during last night's presidential forum?
[02:06:28.413 --> 02:06:37.698]  That is the pilot, the captain of America's conspiracy theory mothership, Alex Jones.
[02:06:37.718 --> 02:06:39.879]  You just had to keep digging, didn't you Alex?
[02:06:41.124 --> 02:06:42.364]  The plan was so simple.
[02:06:42.464 --> 02:06:46.626]  All Hillary had to do was open a jar of pickles and the White House would be all ours.
[02:06:46.646 --> 02:06:49.307]  You're going to be part of the conspiracy now, you realize that, right?
[02:06:49.327 --> 02:06:50.287]  I'm going to try and do my best.
[02:06:50.487 --> 02:06:52.208]  Alex Jones is going to be all over you.
[02:06:52.248 --> 02:06:52.988]  Let's see what happens.
[02:06:53.028 --> 02:06:53.848]  Okay, here we go.
[02:06:54.648 --> 02:06:55.129]  Here it is.
[02:06:55.789 --> 02:06:56.469]  Whoa, blitzer.
[02:06:57.229 --> 02:06:57.589]  Oh, no.
[02:06:59.570 --> 02:07:06.272]  Oh, there was a... They are all in on this total conspiracy theory that literally came from Infowars.
[02:07:06.592 --> 02:07:08.493]  First of all, Hayes, I'll get you for this segment.
[02:07:09.423 --> 02:07:13.585]  It may take years and cost thousands of lives, but I'll get you for this.
[02:07:13.925 --> 02:07:23.731]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[02:07:24.991 --> 02:07:27.093]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[02:07:30.334 --> 02:07:33.316]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:07:33.676 --> 02:07:35.377]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:35.817 --> 02:07:38.679]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:07:39.631 --> 02:07:49.675]  And it matters because it's not just the kook fringe, it's not just the sort of remunerative conspiracy theory world of that part of the conservative media machine.
[02:07:49.956 --> 02:07:54.918]  It's not even just wacky people who have made their way into Republican politics at a surprising height.
[02:07:55.158 --> 02:07:56.919]  This is now the top of the Republican ticket.
[02:08:15.316 --> 02:08:17.197]  We're now raiding the Castle of Falsehood.
[02:08:17.717 --> 02:08:20.018]  It's Tuesday, October 11th, 2016.
[02:08:21.639 --> 02:08:28.923]  We are now only 27 short days out from the most important election in modern history.
[02:08:28.963 --> 02:08:39.548]  An election that may decide the fate, not just of our Republic, but the world.
[02:08:39.888 --> 02:08:41.529]  The day of doom is here!
[02:08:44.065 --> 02:08:46.367]  Thulsa Doom and his mountain of power.
[02:08:47.208 --> 02:08:52.913]  Atop it sits his king, George Soros, launching division, civil war, and death.
[02:08:53.974 --> 02:08:58.098]  But the American people and others across the globe are scaling the mountains.
[02:09:00.159 --> 02:09:05.965]  And are now in the mountain, engaging the forces of the Snake.
[02:09:07.961 --> 02:09:11.285]  If you haven't seen Conan the Barbarian, I'm doing an allegory of what's happening currently with that.
[02:09:11.305 --> 02:09:13.807]  You know who wrote it?
[02:09:22.367 --> 02:09:22.887]  Oliver Stone.
[02:09:23.628 --> 02:09:25.789]  Now the next one was super cheesy and horrible and unwatchable.
[02:09:25.809 --> 02:09:27.510]  Conan the Destroyer.
[02:09:28.370 --> 02:09:30.391]  Conan the Barbarian is a real classic.
[02:09:30.631 --> 02:09:31.331]  Shot in Spain.
[02:09:31.812 --> 02:09:32.212]  Amazing.
[02:09:32.952 --> 02:09:33.733]  Can't watch the movie enough.
[02:09:33.753 --> 02:09:34.493]  You understand that?
[02:09:34.513 --> 02:09:36.474]  So I need to, is that my assignment?
[02:09:36.694 --> 02:09:36.914]  Yeah.
[02:09:37.074 --> 02:09:38.035]  I may have to fire you.
[02:09:38.055 --> 02:09:38.895]  You don't like that thing?
[02:09:38.935 --> 02:09:39.435]  You hear that Rob do?
[02:09:39.495 --> 02:09:42.477]  I gotta go home right after this and I gotta go watch Conan the Barbarian.
[02:09:42.497 --> 02:09:44.438]  Have ladies in bikinis while you're watching.
[02:09:45.697 --> 02:09:47.399]  The day of doom is here!
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:52.966]  The day of doom is here, Alex, and I'm hoping that it's the day of doom for the Clinton Crime Syndicate.
[02:09:52.986 --> 02:09:53.687]  That's what I'm hoping.
[02:09:54.468 --> 02:09:54.969]  Not for us.
[02:09:55.029 --> 02:09:56.991]  For Thulsa Doom and his mountain of power?
[02:09:58.553 --> 02:10:00.354]  Not for... Pretty good Max von Sydow invitation.
[02:10:00.434 --> 02:10:01.695]  Not for Drudge and Infowars.
[02:10:01.715 --> 02:10:02.955]  Do you know who Max von Sydow is?
[02:10:02.975 --> 02:10:03.035]  No.
[02:10:03.075 --> 02:10:04.376]  You're getting in more trouble by the minute.
[02:10:04.796 --> 02:10:05.257]  Oh boy.
[02:10:06.137 --> 02:10:07.438]  I'm being serious.
[02:10:07.698 --> 02:10:09.599]  I got a little excited about Fight the New World Order.
[02:10:10.859 --> 02:10:11.720]  I want to go to phone calls.
[02:10:11.740 --> 02:10:12.880]  You've been incredible champs.
[02:10:13.381 --> 02:10:15.262]  Quincy and Scott and Matt and Sherry.
[02:10:16.553 --> 02:10:28.726]  Probably just as big as this, though, is the fact that we have the New York Commissioner of Elections caught in a Christmas party 10 months ago, 11 months ago, saying, I don't like it.
[02:10:29.046 --> 02:10:37.155]  The Democrats bust around the candidates, these bastards, the poor people, to all the different polling places and have them vote over and over again with dead people and folks' names.
[02:10:38.353 --> 02:10:39.154]  We'll say it on camera.
[02:10:39.234 --> 02:10:40.195]  Oh no, I don't want to do that.
[02:10:40.615 --> 02:10:43.458]  Meanwhile, they don't want us to have, you know, any voter ID.
[02:10:43.518 --> 02:10:47.962]  And listen, I'm anti-police state, but we've lost that battle, you know, showing IDs here, there, there, there.
[02:10:48.162 --> 02:10:54.268]  If I've got to show up for everything, including wiping my rear end, you should have to show that you're a citizen and that you're in the right spot and vote in the right place.
[02:10:54.909 --> 02:10:56.711]  You would think that'd be, you know, how to keep the rig going.
[02:10:56.731 --> 02:10:58.613]  Well, there's a whole phenomenon where folks go to vote and they can't.
[02:10:58.633 --> 02:10:59.193]  We've already voted.
[02:11:00.014 --> 02:11:01.295]  That happened to me like 10 years ago.
[02:11:01.335 --> 02:11:02.516]  I didn't realize what was happening.
[02:11:03.396 --> 02:11:05.537]  What was happening is someone had voted in my name!
[02:11:05.857 --> 02:11:09.238]  Isn't that, isn't that, this is the perfect illustration of what these, how these people think.
[02:11:09.278 --> 02:11:18.040]  It's like, oh there's no conspiracies, oh there's no rigged elections, we don't need voter IDs, it's not a problem, just go vote, just say you're Eminem, say you're Marshall Mathers.
[02:11:18.340 --> 02:11:22.722]  I'm gonna go vote, I'll say... Oh that's right, people went and voted, Veritas, they went and voted as Eminem.
[02:11:22.742 --> 02:11:23.302]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:11:24.022 --> 02:11:25.884]  So why do you need an ID to vote?
[02:11:25.904 --> 02:11:29.248]  Stole M&Ms in his district, stole his identity!
[02:11:29.689 --> 02:11:30.710]  There's no voter fraud.
[02:11:30.750 --> 02:11:31.631]  What's a rigged election?
[02:11:31.671 --> 02:11:34.134]  By the way, the feds were talking about charges on him for that.
[02:11:34.415 --> 02:11:35.977]  They want to leave it open so it can be stolen.
[02:11:36.197 --> 02:11:38.259]  The investigator that exposes it, they want to charge him.
[02:11:38.359 --> 02:11:41.403]  Everything is awesome when you're part of a team.
[02:11:41.423 --> 02:11:42.264]  You know, we have that audio.
[02:11:42.284 --> 02:11:43.325]  Can we play that at the bottom of the hour?
[02:11:43.846 --> 02:11:44.968]  I'm gonna sing along to the Lego.
[02:11:45.048 --> 02:11:49.654]  I mean, it's sadly illustrative though of how these... You know, that is the average Democratic voter.
[02:11:49.694 --> 02:11:52.918]  They literally... Republican voters, they got some problems.
[02:11:52.938 --> 02:11:55.802]  But man, the Democratic voter is like that Lego character in there.
[02:11:56.083 --> 02:11:58.406]  Well, and it's crazy because... Oh, Hillary just blew up whole countries!
[02:11:58.586 --> 02:11:59.227]  That's awesome!
[02:11:59.247 --> 02:11:59.968]  She's so liberal!
[02:12:00.228 --> 02:12:04.532]  And all of these Republicans now, it's like you're either for Trump or you're against Trump.
[02:12:04.552 --> 02:12:05.653]  Paul Ryan, he can't decide.
[02:12:05.673 --> 02:12:07.515]  He wants to dip his toes in the water.
[02:12:07.535 --> 02:12:09.056]  Paul Ryan is a globalist operative.
[02:12:09.436 --> 02:12:17.403]  But what you're seeing is Donald Trump and whoever is supporting him, in this case, we're going beyond the Republican Party.
[02:12:17.423 --> 02:12:22.268]  They're panicking calling him the evil miracle because they know in real polls he's 10 points ahead, baby.
[02:12:22.808 --> 02:12:23.629]  It's not even close.
[02:12:23.769 --> 02:12:24.749]  It was like 15, though.
[02:12:25.050 --> 02:12:26.771]  This is ahead of about 5 points.
[02:12:27.051 --> 02:12:28.052]  Listen to this, though, Alex.
[02:12:28.692 --> 02:12:32.595]  So we've obviously documented the rallies and who's dominating at the rallies.
[02:12:32.635 --> 02:12:37.578]  I think if you added up the attendance at the rallies, Trump might win by hundreds of thousands of people.
[02:12:38.099 --> 02:12:43.142]  If you go on the Internet, YouTube, whatever, Hillary videos don't get half the views.
[02:12:43.482 --> 02:12:44.243]  It's dislikes.
[02:12:44.283 --> 02:12:45.804]  You'll never find a video with more dislikes.
[02:12:45.824 --> 02:12:46.845]  No, it'll be 10,000 dislikes, 25 likes.
[02:12:46.905 --> 02:12:48.506]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:12:51.528 --> 02:12:52.609]  Only on a Hillary video.
[02:12:52.629 --> 02:12:55.530]  But our videos are like 20,000 likes, 200 dislikes.
[02:12:55.610 --> 02:12:57.211]  Same with the Trump Rally video.
[02:12:57.231 --> 02:12:59.373]  Trump Rally's video gets almost 100,000 views.
[02:12:59.413 --> 02:13:02.274]  And conservatives generally are not seen as being as tech active.
[02:13:02.855 --> 02:13:03.875]  So it's even worse.
[02:13:04.716 --> 02:13:18.644]  And now what I'm seeing, and this is not something that I saw up until honestly just the last couple of weeks, I like to typically monitor C-SPAN because it's a good place to actually see what people in the government are saying and see what other people who are calling in think too.
[02:13:19.364 --> 02:13:20.966]  It is now not even close.
[02:13:20.986 --> 02:13:23.729]  It used to be about 50-50 with pro-Trump, anti-Trump.
[02:13:24.230 --> 02:13:26.592]  It's 9 out of 10, 8 out of 10.
[02:13:26.793 --> 02:13:32.479]  Every morning you listen to C-SPAN, people calling in saying they want Donald Trump.
[02:13:32.519 --> 02:13:35.422]  We cannot let them steal this election.
[02:13:35.462 --> 02:13:37.505]  Hillary has an average of about 100 people, Trump about 20,000.
[02:13:39.026 --> 02:13:40.507]  And they usually turn away tens of thousands.
[02:13:40.527 --> 02:13:43.728]  I mean, in Austin there were traffic jams two and a half, three miles away.
[02:13:43.828 --> 02:13:44.348]  Couldn't even get in.
[02:13:44.628 --> 02:13:45.928]  They got 20,000 in, turned away 20,000.
[02:13:45.988 --> 02:13:48.629]  Yeah, the video, I mean, the St.
[02:13:48.869 --> 02:13:51.310]  Louis rally where we found Abe Skrillex in that video.
[02:13:51.410 --> 02:13:53.411]  I wanted to go to the Trump rally inside that day.
[02:13:53.431 --> 02:13:54.531]  I got there two hours early.
[02:13:54.851 --> 02:13:58.473]  I didn't even bother getting in line because the line was two miles long.
[02:13:58.513 --> 02:13:59.273]  It would have been pointless.
[02:13:59.293 --> 02:14:02.874]  By the way, this is like discovering the wheel or fire or combustion engine.
[02:14:03.194 --> 02:14:04.835]  You and Rob Dew discovered Abe Skrillex.
[02:14:05.515 --> 02:14:07.035]  Well, it was actually Josh Owens.
[02:14:07.195 --> 02:14:08.216]  Oh, Josh Owens.
[02:14:08.256 --> 02:14:09.416]  I get it all mixed up.
[02:14:09.636 --> 02:14:16.297]  Josh Owens, you guys deserve, like, at the end of Episode 4, Star Wars, everybody salutes you and you get, like, golden amulets.
[02:14:16.378 --> 02:14:17.858]  Everybody salutes you.
[02:14:17.878 --> 02:14:18.738]  Dun, dun, dun.
[02:14:18.758 --> 02:14:19.018]  You know what?
[02:14:19.118 --> 02:14:21.919]  I don't want that, but actually, I thought we should do... We're having fun.
[02:14:22.079 --> 02:14:24.799]  We should actually have an alternative news award ceremony.
[02:14:24.819 --> 02:14:28.420]  I already have offered $10,000 each to those guys, the ultimate social justice warriors, to come on.
[02:14:29.861 --> 02:14:30.721]  We've discovered where they live.
[02:14:30.741 --> 02:14:31.241]  We should go there.
[02:14:32.076 --> 02:14:35.158]  Well, I won't get, I can't, we won't get too into that.
[02:14:35.178 --> 02:14:39.682]  Lovingly though, we love bringing flowers, gold, frankincense, myrrh.
[02:14:39.902 --> 02:14:43.265]  I will say though, you know what, you've made a great crew here.
[02:14:43.885 --> 02:14:48.228]  Everybody that I've worked with has been great, but me and Josh, when we go out, for whatever reason, we find gold.
[02:14:48.248 --> 02:14:49.069]  Oh, you guys came back.
[02:14:49.289 --> 02:14:50.310]  Oh, you guys have it already.
[02:14:50.410 --> 02:14:51.111]  We found the gold.
[02:14:51.131 --> 02:14:54.153]  See, I don't pay attention to what you... I know you... I mean, it's not that I'm micromanaging or not caring.
[02:14:54.393 --> 02:14:56.094]  It's that I literally just let you guys fire torpedoes.
[02:14:56.174 --> 02:14:57.996]  I didn't realize we just revealed... Oh, my God.
[02:14:58.176 --> 02:14:58.856]  No, no, no, no.
[02:14:58.916 --> 02:14:59.457]  Well... Hold on.
[02:14:59.497 --> 02:15:00.638]  I knew you were... Oh, my God.
[02:15:00.778 --> 02:15:02.659]  There's nothing we can reveal right now.
[02:15:03.059 --> 02:15:05.581]  Oh, my God.
[02:15:05.881 --> 02:15:08.263]  I forgot you guys were kind of visiting when you were there, see?
[02:15:08.523 --> 02:15:09.564]  Do you want me to talk about it?
[02:15:09.584 --> 02:15:10.445]  Do you want me to tell you what happened?
[02:15:11.758 --> 02:15:12.998]  He doesn't even know about this, folks.
[02:15:13.038 --> 02:15:14.299]  He doesn't even know about this.
[02:15:14.499 --> 02:15:15.079]  I would be telling you.
[02:15:15.099 --> 02:15:16.679]  I'm too busy dealing with the October surprise.
[02:15:16.699 --> 02:15:18.660]  Well, okay, so here's what happened.
[02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:19.640]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:15:19.660 --> 02:15:20.420]  Do you have footage of this?
[02:15:20.980 --> 02:15:23.841]  We've got some footage, but it's nothing that we want to show yet.
[02:15:24.721 --> 02:15:25.702]  It's nothing we can show yet.
[02:15:27.542 --> 02:15:27.862]  You know what?
[02:15:28.002 --> 02:15:31.743]  I mean, we could show it, but I don't want you to tell me what happened.
[02:15:31.803 --> 02:15:33.243]  Okay, I'll keep you in the dark on this one.
[02:15:33.824 --> 02:15:34.504]  We're working on it.
[02:15:34.564 --> 02:15:35.104]  We're working on it.
[02:15:36.107 --> 02:15:37.648]  Well, here's the thing, we want you to come on the show, man.
[02:15:37.688 --> 02:15:38.469]  We don't hate you.
[02:15:38.549 --> 02:15:39.470]  We don't hate you, dude.
[02:15:39.790 --> 02:15:40.671]  We're offering you money.
[02:15:40.691 --> 02:15:44.575]  Yeah, we actually feel bad that you've been brainwashed and this happened to you.
[02:15:44.635 --> 02:15:50.600]  We want to lovingly deprogram you, take you water surfing, take you hanging out.
[02:15:51.020 --> 02:15:51.521]  Shoot a gun.
[02:15:51.541 --> 02:15:52.262]  We'll go shoot guns.
[02:15:52.342 --> 02:15:52.962]  Absolutely.
[02:15:52.982 --> 02:15:53.843]  Go have a steak dinner.
[02:15:54.023 --> 02:15:56.005]  We want to explain what we're doing.
[02:15:56.045 --> 02:15:57.787]  We want, we want renaissance.
[02:15:58.607 --> 02:15:59.508]  We are the liberals.
[02:16:01.510 --> 02:16:01.990]  Trust us.
[02:16:03.218 --> 02:16:08.342]  What you're getting into is not liberal, it's a false paradigm, and we don't want to make fun of you.
[02:16:08.382 --> 02:16:20.492]  We want to even halfway get you to be happy and friendly with us, and then kind of de-escalate everybody attacking you, and have a real discussion where you don't scream we're effing white males when you're an effing white male, and actually rehabilitate you.
[02:16:20.512 --> 02:16:23.414]  I don't mean that condescendingly, but come on, I mean really.
[02:16:25.587 --> 02:16:28.029]  Have a loving moment here, like we did with the Obama phone lady.
[02:16:28.289 --> 02:16:33.713]  And here's what I've said to people like Age Skrillex or people I've had on the show that have different point of views.
[02:16:34.054 --> 02:16:36.095]  You know, we could have a panel.
[02:16:36.355 --> 02:16:38.417]  We can bring in people with differing views from us.
[02:16:38.437 --> 02:16:39.698]  We can bring in Hillary supporters.
[02:16:39.738 --> 02:16:40.479]  He can be one of them.
[02:16:40.679 --> 02:16:41.720]  They never want to come on!
[02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:43.061]  That's what I'm saying!
[02:16:43.541 --> 02:16:45.162]  It doesn't matter how much money you offer them.
[02:16:45.202 --> 02:16:47.304]  And they'll go on the street and go, I'm a lesbian!
[02:16:47.504 --> 02:16:48.465]  I bet you don't like that!
[02:16:48.965 --> 02:16:52.428]  And I'll just go, um, did you ever hear me attack you in any way?
[02:16:52.688 --> 02:16:55.170]  They want to go on the street for a cause.
[02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:56.211]  For a cause, right?
[02:16:57.112 --> 02:17:03.617]  They're moved by this cause of theirs that they're going to go on the street, but then when you ask them a new platform... And they're projecting onto us that we hate them!
[02:17:04.177 --> 02:17:05.699]  And they don't want to come on your platform.
[02:17:05.719 --> 02:17:06.980]  No, you hate us!
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:08.040]  Why won't they come on your platform?
[02:17:08.060 --> 02:17:11.243]  He's like explaining that Donald Trump was against the war, and he goes, shut up, you effing white male!
[02:17:11.823 --> 02:17:15.506]  It's the same dynamic as Bill Clinton... I've got to hang out with Carl the Cuck in person.
[02:17:15.526 --> 02:17:17.068]  ...not taking a DNA test.
[02:17:17.108 --> 02:17:18.209]  I mean, look, this guy could be...
[02:17:19.184 --> 02:17:19.745]  A TV star.
[02:17:19.765 --> 02:17:21.166]  That's what I'm saying!
[02:17:21.186 --> 02:17:23.908]  These guys are ridiculous!
[02:17:24.048 --> 02:17:25.729]  They could be on InfoWars all the time.
[02:17:25.749 --> 02:17:31.034]  They don't realize how much raw energy they've got.
[02:17:32.250 --> 02:17:35.311]  And they could be sitting right here next to me telling me why they feel this way.
[02:17:35.512 --> 02:17:36.512]  Sticking up for Hillary.
[02:17:36.552 --> 02:17:38.993]  Sticking up for the Democratic platform.
[02:17:39.053 --> 02:17:40.174]  I gotta go to calls.
[02:17:40.214 --> 02:17:40.894]  I gotta go to calls.
[02:17:41.374 --> 02:17:44.516]  And I want to get to the video of the latest kind of boil down of St.
[02:17:44.536 --> 02:17:44.816]  Louis.
[02:17:45.316 --> 02:17:49.098]  If you just joined us, DrudgeReport.com, InfoWars.com.
[02:17:50.559 --> 02:17:51.359]  It's all up there.
[02:17:51.499 --> 02:17:53.020]  It is the big exclusive.
[02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:55.761]  Banish the untold story of Danny Williams.
[02:17:56.121 --> 02:17:56.962]  Search for his father.
[02:17:57.822 --> 02:17:59.023]  We premiered it here last hour.
[02:17:59.043 --> 02:18:08.027]  The video, you can see it, is on Infowars.com, PresidentPlanet.com, and I hope it's been sent to Facebook as well, because we're going to have a big article written about this and a whole bunch of other stuff.
[02:18:09.027 --> 02:18:10.288]  We want to pin that to the top, see?
[02:18:10.668 --> 02:18:11.949]  Everyone ran with the Trump video.
[02:18:11.969 --> 02:18:12.749]  You think they'll run with this?
[02:18:14.616 --> 02:18:16.437]  You think you're going to see this video on every mainstream news outlet?
[02:18:16.457 --> 02:18:17.277]  No, but here's the good news.
[02:18:17.358 --> 02:18:25.842]  They think they can sit there on Fox, on CNN, on MSNBC, and only show her wobble to begin to have the convulsion.
[02:18:25.862 --> 02:18:26.603]  I'm skipping this network break.
[02:18:27.203 --> 02:18:30.505]  To begin to have the convulsion and then not fall down.
[02:18:30.525 --> 02:18:32.946]  And they go, conspiracy theorists claim she fell down.
[02:18:33.006 --> 02:18:33.867]  All she did was stumble.
[02:18:34.207 --> 02:18:35.188]  I have Fox host.
[02:18:35.308 --> 02:18:36.208]  I have CNN host.
[02:18:36.648 --> 02:18:37.509]  I have MSNBC host.
[02:18:37.709 --> 02:18:42.692]  You're lying when everyone saw her fall on her face having a convulsion and put in the black ambulance.
[02:18:43.252 --> 02:18:45.015]  She drives around in a frickin' ambulance!
[02:18:45.035 --> 02:18:48.279]  It's like you dragging me across the floor right now and then everyone's saying, what?
[02:18:48.479 --> 02:18:49.861]  Alex was just helping him walk out of here.
[02:18:50.702 --> 02:18:52.965]  Yeah, they sit there and think they can just deceive everybody.
[02:18:54.209 --> 02:18:55.870]  Drudge has billions of visitors a month.
[02:18:56.531 --> 02:18:58.552]  Hundreds of millions of folks come, but over and over again, so it's billions.
[02:18:58.853 --> 02:19:00.194]  We have millions and millions every day.
[02:19:00.774 --> 02:19:01.835]  Tens of millions every week.
[02:19:02.656 --> 02:19:04.237]  Our videos, I mean, I'm not exaggerating.
[02:19:04.257 --> 02:19:06.879]  When I say 30 million viewers and listeners a week, that's conservative.
[02:19:06.939 --> 02:19:08.080]  It was like 26 million a few months ago.
[02:19:08.100 --> 02:19:09.621]  It's just straight up.
[02:19:10.141 --> 02:19:15.425]  And of course, even on big shows like The Daily Show, which does have 4, 5, 6 million viewers, you know, quote, entertainment is really brainwashing.
[02:19:16.385 --> 02:19:18.067]  Brainwashing news, masquerading as entertainment.
[02:19:18.487 --> 02:19:22.732]  If they get you in a happy mode and know you're not being critical, then they go, look at these conservatives and libertarians.
[02:19:22.952 --> 02:19:24.133]  This lady's got 68 million.
[02:19:24.173 --> 02:19:25.214]  This guy's got 25 million.
[02:19:25.254 --> 02:19:25.795]  Just one video.
[02:19:25.955 --> 02:19:28.137]  This next video has 5 million, 12 million, 20 million.
[02:19:28.357 --> 02:19:31.641]  This guy, this Paul Watson's got 20 million, 15 million, 18 million, 19 million, 5 million.
[02:19:31.741 --> 02:19:33.323]  And they're like, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[02:19:33.423 --> 02:19:35.044]  You know, you've got millions of views on your videos.
[02:19:36.748 --> 02:19:37.569]  They're just dilute.
[02:19:37.629 --> 02:19:38.850]  No one wants to watch you.
[02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:40.031]  They know you're a fop.
[02:19:40.491 --> 02:19:42.293]  It's lazy is what it is.
[02:19:42.353 --> 02:19:43.073]  It's laziness.
[02:19:43.393 --> 02:19:45.395]  You just, you know, click on your TV.
[02:19:45.435 --> 02:19:52.421]  No one wants to hear the same variants of talking points with a bunch of talking heads acting like they're debating and acting like they're intellectual.
[02:19:52.541 --> 02:19:53.381]  Oh, but didn't you?
[02:19:53.641 --> 02:19:53.882]  Oh, my.
[02:19:54.202 --> 02:19:56.244]  The ancillary didn't really fall down.
[02:19:56.524 --> 02:19:58.505]  The racist Alex Jones said she did.
[02:19:58.786 --> 02:20:00.367]  Drudge got caught lying again.
[02:20:00.387 --> 02:20:03.589]  He says there's a penalty if you don't get Obamacare.
[02:20:03.609 --> 02:20:05.451]  Everybody then gets the penalty and they go,
[02:20:05.971 --> 02:20:06.771]  The media's lying!
[02:20:07.152 --> 02:20:10.973]  Well, I heard Donald Trump say he wants to grab women in an inappropriate place.
[02:20:10.993 --> 02:20:12.994]  He's a... I can't vote for him.
[02:20:13.014 --> 02:20:14.135]  It's clearly all edited together.
[02:20:14.175 --> 02:20:17.596]  It's like, these women throw themselves at you when you're a star, you just grab them and they wouldn't care.
[02:20:17.896 --> 02:20:20.037]  It's like, I mean... Because they're grabbing you!
[02:20:20.517 --> 02:20:20.978]  Stupid!
[02:20:21.358 --> 02:20:26.300]  Here's the thing, all of these people, who's buying... I mean, in a hotel room, door opens, woman jumps on you.
[02:20:26.440 --> 02:20:29.682]  I think, what was it, 100 million copies sold of Fifty Shades of Grey?
[02:20:29.742 --> 02:20:30.522]  Who bought those books?
[02:20:30.842 --> 02:20:31.963]  Men didn't buy those books!
[02:20:32.243 --> 02:20:33.103]  I guarantee you that!
[02:20:33.503 --> 02:20:36.424]  I guarantee you men didn't buy 100 million copies of Fifty Shades of Grey!
[02:20:36.444 --> 02:20:38.765]  Women act more like men ever did.
[02:20:38.885 --> 02:20:40.466]  It's like running around like piranhas.
[02:20:41.226 --> 02:20:45.688]  Oh, it's a sexual assault when a woman, you know, sits there and whistles at you and says, hey baby?
[02:20:45.808 --> 02:20:49.630]  And all of these movie stars that all of these trendy liberals probably follow on Twitter.
[02:20:49.650 --> 02:20:53.732]  Oh, Hillary hangs out with the worst horrible rappers that objectify women down to property.
[02:20:54.432 --> 02:20:56.413]  Look, I'm sure you've been around this.
[02:20:56.473 --> 02:20:58.813]  If you're around... I'm not defending what Trump did.
[02:20:58.853 --> 02:21:03.954]  The point is you have a giant mountain of evil Hillary and then this obviously sneak attack from 11 years ago.
[02:21:05.275 --> 02:21:06.955]  It's hypocrisy on PCP.
[02:21:07.495 --> 02:21:08.215]  We gotta go to the calls.
[02:21:08.255 --> 02:21:09.476]  I appreciate Quincy holding.
[02:21:10.056 --> 02:21:11.516]  I appreciate Scott holding.
[02:21:11.576 --> 02:21:15.277]  I appreciate Matt and Sherry and Decker and Keebler and everybody else.
[02:21:15.597 --> 02:21:18.278]  Quincy in Ohio, you're on the air with Owen Schroer and Alex Jones.
[02:21:18.318 --> 02:21:19.438]  The Danny Williams info dropped.
[02:21:21.445 --> 02:21:24.006]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:21:24.026 --> 02:21:24.586]  You bet, brother.
[02:21:24.706 --> 02:21:26.286]  Actually, just call me Q, if you would.
[02:21:26.687 --> 02:21:27.347]  Alright.
[02:21:28.027 --> 02:21:31.008]  Hey, thanks for putting your life on the line for this movement.
[02:21:31.588 --> 02:21:33.669]  You're a true patriot, and you're in my prayers.
[02:21:33.869 --> 02:21:35.089]  I'm sure you're in everybody's prayers.
[02:21:36.290 --> 02:21:37.950]  There's a couple things I wanted to talk about.
[02:21:37.990 --> 02:21:39.090]  Number one was WikiLeaks.
[02:21:39.310 --> 02:21:40.311]  That was what we started with.
[02:21:41.071 --> 02:21:42.371]  The second thing is voter fraud.
[02:21:42.611 --> 02:21:43.032]  Yes, sir!
[02:21:44.792 --> 02:21:50.634]  As it relates to WikiLeaks, one of my concerns, Alex, I'm glad to see it's coming out, but it's coming out towards the end.
[02:21:52.020 --> 02:21:55.983]  I just feel like we're being deluged with information and I'm afraid it's going to get diluted.
[02:21:57.303 --> 02:22:00.305]  I hear you, but I kind of see they knew Hillary would launch her attacks late.
[02:22:00.945 --> 02:22:05.748]  And so I want to say Assange, I mean, I was wrong.
[02:22:05.848 --> 02:22:08.089]  I mean, he did troll everybody.
[02:22:08.890 --> 02:22:09.810]  So people understand why I did it.
[02:22:09.850 --> 02:22:14.513]  But I just want to be a man and say that Assange is really delivering now.
[02:22:14.533 --> 02:22:15.133]  So I appreciate that.
[02:22:15.173 --> 02:22:16.214]  His GPA went back up.
[02:22:17.494 --> 02:22:17.935]  Absolutely.
[02:22:19.028 --> 02:22:20.429]  I'd give him a 3.8 right now, wouldn't you?
[02:22:20.810 --> 02:22:24.653]  Yeah, I think we've had him down at like the 3.2, and now he's back up at a 3.8.
[02:22:24.974 --> 02:22:27.776]  I'll give him myself a 3.0!
[02:22:30.819 --> 02:22:31.460]  He's modest.
[02:22:31.580 --> 02:22:32.561]  Anyways, Caller, go ahead, sorry.
[02:22:33.462 --> 02:22:35.564]  I'm sure he's gonna hit 4.0 before the end of the month.
[02:22:36.004 --> 02:22:37.586]  He'll give us the information we need.
[02:22:38.186 --> 02:22:42.671]  You know, the second thing we were talking about, you know, earlier, talking about voter fraud, you know, you know, we've got
[02:22:43.487 --> 02:22:50.473]  You actually have voter fraud where there are multiple votes, there's dead people voting, you have a, you know... You have the head of the New York Election Commission saying it!
[02:22:51.814 --> 02:22:54.496]  Yes, I saw the video this morning on Drudge.
[02:22:55.177 --> 02:23:00.041]  It's really interesting, there's a proof right there, but you're not going to get the people to, the right people to watch it.
[02:23:00.061 --> 02:23:02.102]  We need the independents and some of the Democrats.
[02:23:02.242 --> 02:23:06.466]  Well that's why all of us have to reach out to these people lovingly and give them the info.
[02:23:08.220 --> 02:23:08.800]  Absolutely.
[02:23:08.820 --> 02:23:12.041]  You talk about voter fraud, you talk about election fraud.
[02:23:12.121 --> 02:23:15.922]  One thing that really concerns me is the electoral college.
[02:23:16.302 --> 02:23:23.144]  There's particular people that I think that the top people in our government can reach out to on election day and sway their vote.
[02:23:24.904 --> 02:23:31.306]  If it's something close and Trump has got a particular district or an area, I believe these people can be swayed.
[02:23:32.645 --> 02:23:36.690]  Well, absolutely, and beyond that, everybody's like, it's a big country, where do you go to catch the fraud?
[02:23:37.230 --> 02:23:40.454]  If citizens go out in the early morning on November 8th...
[02:23:41.693 --> 02:23:53.243]  And you go out to the polling places in the key battleground areas in Democrat districts, they're going to be there cramming ballots with fake names they're putting through, dead people, folks they know haven't voted in 20 years.
[02:23:53.743 --> 02:23:54.684]  This is what they do.
[02:23:54.744 --> 02:23:58.427]  You catch that on tape, you catch somebody doing it, that will devastate them.
[02:23:58.467 --> 02:24:04.673]  We get 20, 30 videos of this nationwide, it will have public opinion on the side for a recount, and then it'll come out Trump won.
[02:24:04.773 --> 02:24:05.974]  Let me tell you, they're freaking out.
[02:24:06.194 --> 02:24:06.895]  Trump's going to fight.
[02:24:07.958 --> 02:24:13.103]  He knows he's ahead of his internal polls, and they're going to pull something big.
[02:24:13.323 --> 02:24:18.528]  But expanding what you said, we've got to go in, and look, I'll put my money where my mouth is.
[02:24:18.568 --> 02:24:23.112]  You need to go to Democratic areas and go into Democrat bar and talk to them.
[02:24:23.132 --> 02:24:24.073]  But I'll tell you what's going to happen.
[02:24:24.474 --> 02:24:27.837]  You're going to find out they agree with you and don't like Hillary.
[02:24:29.266 --> 02:24:30.027]  That's what I'm telling you.
[02:24:30.047 --> 02:24:31.168]  That's why the fraud's so big.
[02:24:31.469 --> 02:24:32.770]  Most Democrats aren't supporting him.
[02:24:32.810 --> 02:24:43.604]  You go to buffoon area colleges and buffoon area trendy areas, young idiots that never had a job in their life and are on their third, you know, third deal at college because there is no future and they're still getting rope-a-doped.
[02:24:44.285 --> 02:24:44.865]  They're victims.
[02:24:45.046 --> 02:24:46.608]  They are going to hiss and attack you.
[02:24:47.088 --> 02:24:52.033]  But if you go talking to working class or middle class liberals, or quote minorities, they're not stupid.
[02:24:52.653 --> 02:24:54.615]  They know the economy's falling apart.
[02:24:54.976 --> 02:24:56.217]  They know Hillary's a damn witch.
[02:24:56.257 --> 02:24:56.737]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:24:56.757 --> 02:25:06.907]  Well, the gravity of this election is so powerful that what we're seeing is, okay, so let's say 50% of the population is politically involved and informed and 50% isn't.
[02:25:06.947 --> 02:25:10.471]  So these other 50%, they're paying attention to sports, they're paying attention to this, that, or the other thing.
[02:25:10.751 --> 02:25:15.414]  Well, the gravity of this election is so powerful that now they're being drugged in this direction.
[02:25:15.554 --> 02:25:17.075]  Yes, that's why we went either way.
[02:25:17.095 --> 02:25:17.616]  It's waking them up.
[02:25:17.896 --> 02:25:30.784]  And what I've experienced, in fact, just on this trip alone after this debate, I heard multiple people who said, hey, you know, just in conversation, whatever, around the airport, around the bus station, all this, like, hey, you see that debate last night?
[02:25:30.824 --> 02:25:31.165]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:25:31.245 --> 02:25:33.886]  And they're saying, wow, you know, I'm shocked.
[02:25:33.906 --> 02:25:35.648]  But Donald Trump was actually really good.
[02:25:35.708 --> 02:25:36.348]  I couldn't believe it.
[02:25:36.388 --> 02:25:37.029]  He actually came.
[02:25:37.069 --> 02:25:37.569]  He surprised.
[02:25:37.589 --> 02:25:39.090]  I actually think I like Donald Trump.
[02:25:39.390 --> 02:25:40.631]  So there's this untapped
[02:25:40.691 --> 02:25:41.150]  Yeah.
[02:25:41.508 --> 02:25:43.109]  There's voters out there, and that's why they're panicking.
[02:25:43.129 --> 02:25:45.811]  You go to a lot of these areas, half the people going in are Hispanic.
[02:25:46.431 --> 02:25:49.293]  We have rallies, it's like, there's like 40% black people there.
[02:25:49.333 --> 02:25:49.794]  I love that.
[02:25:49.814 --> 02:25:50.314]  I mean, I love it.
[02:25:50.894 --> 02:25:51.495]  It's breaking through.
[02:25:51.535 --> 02:25:56.238]  The Democrats see that and panic, because they always said, don't go to a patriot meeting, you're not wanted.
[02:25:56.438 --> 02:25:59.160]  So they get hugged and taken to dinner, and it's all real.
[02:25:59.741 --> 02:26:04.724]  And that's what's panicking everyone, because it's lowering the facade.
[02:26:04.784 --> 02:26:08.486]  And exactly, a lot of folks go, I'm not sure about Trump, but I'm going to go see.
[02:26:08.567 --> 02:26:10.108]  When they come out, they go, wow, that was great.
[02:26:10.808 --> 02:26:12.991]  Yeah, I'm gonna support Trump now, and that's what's got him panicking.
[02:26:13.292 --> 02:26:15.235]  Their whole parent folks, it's a rout.
[02:26:15.555 --> 02:26:16.897]  He was gonna win by a landslide.
[02:26:17.698 --> 02:26:23.407]  All these dirty tricks, lying polls saying he's way behind, that's getting some weak-minded people to pull their support.
[02:26:23.447 --> 02:26:25.430]  So now his lead has narrowed, I'm gonna be honest.
[02:26:25.450 --> 02:26:25.911]  5-10 points.
[02:26:28.536 --> 02:26:35.422]  Just the fact that the whole mainstream media has had to go to thermal meltdown to even have this effect shows they're on fumes.
[02:26:35.642 --> 02:26:36.483]  They're running out.
[02:26:36.683 --> 02:26:37.484]  Their days are numbered.
[02:26:37.504 --> 02:26:39.686]  Go ahead, Quincy.
[02:26:39.886 --> 02:26:40.967]  What about verification?
[02:26:41.087 --> 02:26:50.575]  I mean, if you look back at, for example, 2012 with Romney in Ohio here, I could drive down the road and find 20 to 1 Romney signs to Hillary Clinton.
[02:26:50.595 --> 02:26:51.276]  But of course he lost.
[02:26:51.336 --> 02:26:51.636]  Of course.
[02:26:51.656 --> 02:26:52.216]  The fix is in.
[02:26:52.357 --> 02:26:53.478]  But he lost.
[02:26:53.558 --> 02:26:56.220]  But if you look at the, you can go back and look at the election results.
[02:26:56.846 --> 02:26:58.666]  And you can look at it by district.
[02:26:58.686 --> 02:27:01.787]  When you look at it by district, you'll see that it was Romney, 861 votes.
[02:27:01.807 --> 02:27:01.927]  Obama, 873.
[02:27:01.967 --> 02:27:03.088]  The next district, Romney, 970 votes.
[02:27:03.108 --> 02:27:04.148]  Obama, 992.
[02:27:04.188 --> 02:27:08.289]  Every district, it seems, that you look at, it always shows that it just smells of fraud.
[02:27:21.997 --> 02:27:27.219]  That they went in there and they always either they flipped it or they just wanted to always make it where Obama just had a few more.
[02:27:27.599 --> 02:27:32.981]  If you had a verification process, you know, I mean, you listen to Trump and I love listening to him.
[02:27:33.681 --> 02:27:36.282]  Every speech seems to be different, but he's getting the message out.
[02:27:36.302 --> 02:27:38.482]  He's very powerful in his speaking and his message.
[02:27:38.982 --> 02:27:41.883]  But he's always saying this is an America movement, America, America.
[02:27:41.923 --> 02:27:42.624]  This is a movement.
[02:27:42.644 --> 02:27:43.284]  This is a movement.
[02:27:44.084 --> 02:27:46.925]  Alex, I own the domain, America movement.
[02:27:48.208 --> 02:27:51.651]  I would love to work with you on putting together some type of app.
[02:27:51.831 --> 02:27:52.731]  No, I hear you, brother.
[02:27:52.752 --> 02:27:53.212]  We're believing.
[02:27:53.232 --> 02:27:53.672]  We're trying.
[02:27:53.692 --> 02:27:54.273]  We appreciate it.
[02:27:54.293 --> 02:27:54.913]  Just go do it.
[02:27:54.933 --> 02:27:56.494]  If it's great, we'll hook Lincoln with you.
[02:27:56.814 --> 02:27:57.515]  We need the help.
[02:27:57.555 --> 02:27:59.376]  We just can't even coordinate our own operation, but I hear you.
[02:27:59.616 --> 02:28:00.137]  God bless you.
[02:28:00.357 --> 02:28:02.798]  Q, we got to move quick because we're getting these calls here.
[02:28:02.818 --> 02:28:03.199]  I'm horrible.
[02:28:03.499 --> 02:28:04.780]  Scott in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:28:04.820 --> 02:28:05.140]  Go ahead.
[02:28:06.921 --> 02:28:07.441]  Hi, Alex.
[02:28:07.862 --> 02:28:08.902]  Yeah, good to talk to you.
[02:28:10.063 --> 02:28:15.427]  Down here in Houston, we think Trump needs a blockbuster October surprise of his own.
[02:28:17.819 --> 02:28:19.181]  Attacking Hillary is great.
[02:28:19.963 --> 02:28:24.710]  That is swigging some votes, but he needs issues that will put him over the top.
[02:28:25.452 --> 02:28:27.495]  Something along the line of bail out the people.
[02:28:28.877 --> 02:28:29.478]  That's good.
[02:28:29.498 --> 02:28:30.299]  Well, you know how you bail them out?
[02:28:31.257 --> 02:28:32.098]  You do what Kennedy did.
[02:28:32.138 --> 02:28:34.840]  He cut taxes in the main bracket 50% to the rich 30%.
[02:28:35.761 --> 02:28:38.983]  Tax receipts more than doubled within one year.
[02:28:39.584 --> 02:28:42.706]  They paid off the debt that was small then, brought in all the money.
[02:28:43.207 --> 02:28:47.390]  Problem was, Reagan cut taxes, more money came in, but they just ballooned spending.
[02:28:47.930 --> 02:28:48.971]  Republicans were part of that too.
[02:28:49.492 --> 02:28:54.556]  But, I mean, we know, you cut taxes, more money comes in, because more money gets spent, the economy booms.
[02:28:54.576 --> 02:28:56.838]  The globalists don't want a boom economy here, they want it in China.
[02:28:57.658 --> 02:29:01.242]  And so I think he's giving those speeches, it's just the media doesn't ever carry it.
[02:29:01.542 --> 02:29:06.327]  So how do you get that through to people that really believe they can only get ahead with a government hand-out?
[02:29:06.988 --> 02:29:07.869]  How do you do that, Scott?
[02:29:08.729 --> 02:29:10.411]  Okay, here's a blockbuster idea.
[02:29:10.451 --> 02:29:12.673]  Forgive all bank-issued loans to the people.
[02:29:14.075 --> 02:29:17.018]  People own their houses, they own their land, they own their cars.
[02:29:17.731 --> 02:29:18.891]  And the banks are not penalized.
[02:29:18.911 --> 02:29:21.612]  They take it off the asset side and the liability side.
[02:29:22.192 --> 02:29:23.292]  Well, I mean, I gotta be honest with you.
[02:29:23.312 --> 02:29:33.714]  I don't like the big banks and loan sharking and payday loans and stuff, but I mean, if somebody goes and gets a 20-year mortgage on a house and they've been paying on it a year, you think it's fair for them to just get the house free?
[02:29:35.174 --> 02:29:37.555]  We're down to the last days, Alex.
[02:29:38.615 --> 02:29:43.976]  Well, I guess he would get all the communists to vote for him that way and we'd win, but then we'd become what we're fighting.
[02:29:44.216 --> 02:29:44.876]  You know, I hear you.
[02:29:45.987 --> 02:29:46.508]  Very interesting.
[02:29:46.528 --> 02:29:47.288]  God bless you, Scott.
[02:29:47.308 --> 02:29:48.089]  Very interesting point.
[02:29:48.109 --> 02:29:51.833]  We're going to come back with Matt and Sherry and Tony and Luke and everybody else.
[02:29:51.873 --> 02:29:52.173]  Yeah.
[02:29:53.414 --> 02:29:54.415]  You know, I hear you.
[02:29:54.456 --> 02:29:58.900]  I say if a company did criminal loans and sold the mortgage more than once, I say give them the house.
[02:29:59.000 --> 02:29:59.901]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.381 --> 02:30:01.983]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.924 --> 02:30:05.607]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.206 --> 02:30:14.048]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.

[02:32:10.234 --> 02:32:11.534]  New WikiLeaks emails!
[02:32:11.674 --> 02:32:15.356]  Clinton campaign insiders fear Bill's sex life could sink Hillary.
[02:32:15.456 --> 02:32:17.816]  They should shut the hell up about this, Podesta told.
[02:32:18.036 --> 02:32:19.817]  Article up by Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:32:19.877 --> 02:32:28.620]  The revelation is of particular note because it dovetails with Trump holding a press conference yesterday before the debate with three of Clinton's sexual abuse victims.
[02:32:28.760 --> 02:32:35.742]  The email, which is marked confidential, was sent to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta by prominent left-wing journalist Brent Badowski.
[02:32:35.862 --> 02:32:39.903]  It includes details of Badowski's exchange with someone in the media who told him that
[02:32:40.103 --> 02:32:45.387]  There are people close to the Clintons who say William Jefferson Clinton's sex life could be damaging to her.
[02:32:45.527 --> 02:32:56.756]  Although Badowski stresses his view that the more Bill Clinton the better for Hillary, he adds that there were people purportedly close to the Clintons pushing the line that the less Bill Clinton the better.
[02:32:56.876 --> 02:33:05.122]  Whoever's peddling this crap from somewhere within the Clinton camp is having the effect of encouraging the media to give the issue more prominence, complains Badowski.
[02:33:05.202 --> 02:33:09.566]  You can find more reports like this as we expose the Clintons at InfoWars.com.
[02:33:21.071 --> 02:33:29.393]  27.
[02:33:22.951 --> 02:33:29.393]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.553 --> 02:33:32.674]  Only 27 days until the epic election.
[02:33:33.394 --> 02:33:36.355]  And we don't need to speculate about election fraud.
[02:33:36.375 --> 02:33:38.696]  We have a long documented history of it.
[02:33:40.663 --> 02:34:00.535]  And now, the Democrats all over the country from Florida to New York are being caught announcing that they're going to have busloads of people voting over and over and over and over again for the Democratic Party officials and the candidates on the buses with them, in many cases driving around, running everything in giant fraud, according to the head of the New York Election Commission and others.
[02:34:01.316 --> 02:34:07.500]  Massive, massive, you know, Jane Doe votes going on in Florida on the ballot.
[02:34:07.520 --> 02:34:09.381]  The New York Times saying, why preliminary?
[02:34:09.961 --> 02:34:15.485]  Election officials tell us it looks like Hillary's winning in preliminary early voting where they do the special stuffing.
[02:34:16.006 --> 02:34:18.147]  So get ready for the recounts, get ready for the battle.
[02:34:18.448 --> 02:34:19.669]  Trump is not rolling over.
[02:34:20.549 --> 02:34:21.930]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[02:34:21.950 --> 02:34:23.011]  I want to go right back to your calls.
[02:34:23.331 --> 02:34:24.292]  Owen Schroer is here with us.
[02:34:24.693 --> 02:34:28.335]  Clinton suggests intervention for protesters wearing Clinton rape shirt.
[02:34:28.395 --> 02:34:29.316]  More of those happening.
[02:34:29.636 --> 02:34:33.900]  Video African-American man kicked out of Hillary rally for wearing Bill Clinton rape t-shirt.
[02:34:35.272 --> 02:34:35.553]  U.S.
[02:34:35.593 --> 02:34:37.615]  Navy destroyer comes under attack off Yemen.
[02:34:38.195 --> 02:34:38.736]  Pentagon.
[02:34:39.116 --> 02:34:39.176]  U.S.
[02:34:39.236 --> 02:34:39.557]  and U.K.
[02:34:39.597 --> 02:34:44.462]  continue actively participating in Saudi war crimes targeting the civilians in Yemen.
[02:34:45.803 --> 02:34:46.224]  The U.S.
[02:34:46.284 --> 02:34:48.106]  edges dangerously closer to war with Russia.
[02:34:48.906 --> 02:34:52.370]  What you're not being told on InfoWars.com.
[02:34:52.510 --> 02:34:57.755]  No mentions of ISIS genocide by Christians during the presidential debate.
[02:34:58.632 --> 02:35:03.156]  General Boykin, how does transgender integration help military fight and win wars?
[02:35:03.256 --> 02:35:09.262]  I think we should have people dressed up in hot red high heels and, you know, training outfits running around driving the tanks.
[02:35:09.342 --> 02:35:09.742]  Why not?
[02:35:09.762 --> 02:35:10.883]  It might confuse the enemy.
[02:35:10.903 --> 02:35:12.365]  This country's... Exactly.
[02:35:12.405 --> 02:35:13.706]  Go ahead and do it.
[02:35:13.786 --> 02:35:14.407]  Whatever, man.
[02:35:14.847 --> 02:35:15.408]  Totally normal.
[02:35:16.108 --> 02:35:17.750]  Anyways, it's not a way to shut down our military.
[02:35:17.810 --> 02:35:18.951]  It's not sabotage the country.
[02:35:19.171 --> 02:35:21.013]  We have all the emails admitting sabotage.
[02:35:21.314 --> 02:35:22.775]  Now they're sabotaging the culture.
[02:35:22.935 --> 02:35:24.297]  They admit screwing everybody over.
[02:35:24.837 --> 02:35:25.498]  It's okay though.
[02:35:25.778 --> 02:35:26.399]  Creating race war.
[02:35:26.659 --> 02:35:32.605]  Randy, poll that Hillary Clinton's 11 points ahead is run by Clinton, the ally, paid off by Super PAC.
[02:35:32.665 --> 02:35:33.286]  It's all admitted.
[02:35:33.326 --> 02:35:36.549]  I mean, again, CNN's put out two polls where they'll
[02:35:37.495 --> 02:35:40.216]  Sample 40-something, just because they vary, you can look it up.
[02:35:42.958 --> 02:35:45.039]  CNN caught running another fake poll or rigged poll.
[02:35:45.259 --> 02:35:47.080]  You can read their own methodology screenshots.
[02:35:47.300 --> 02:35:56.425]  They tell you, we sampled 40-something percent Democrats, 20-something Republicans, and then 20-something percent Independents, which are really Democrats.
[02:35:56.445 --> 02:35:59.607]  So it's really like 60-percent Democrats and 27-percent Republicans.
[02:35:59.847 --> 02:36:00.887]  And then she only wins by 15 points.
[02:36:02.549 --> 02:36:05.471]  A three-year-old can figure this out, Josh.
[02:36:06.111 --> 02:36:07.492]  We found out, Josh, earlier.
[02:36:07.632 --> 02:36:10.915]  This is what happens when you've got 500 stories on your desk, Alex.
[02:36:11.515 --> 02:36:11.855]  Literally.
[02:36:12.736 --> 02:36:20.921]  But here's the thing, we found the most recent claimed poll that CNN is running, everybody's running with, the Wall Street Journal, all these people, saying Clinton is up by 11 points.
[02:36:21.302 --> 02:36:23.303]  We found, you can find it, it's public information.
[02:36:23.923 --> 02:36:25.304]  We found who they polled.
[02:36:25.905 --> 02:36:30.147]  It's more than a quarter staunch Democrats, okay?
[02:36:30.488 --> 02:36:31.889]  And then they go down the list and then it's
[02:36:32.810 --> 02:36:37.578]  Normal Democrats, and then it's independents, and then it's strong Republicans, and then, you know, kind of Republicans.
[02:36:37.818 --> 02:36:44.870]  And of course, by and large, it's not even close, the percentage, if you want to pull up the document, Cam, right now.
[02:36:44.910 --> 02:36:46.012]  Let's go to his phone so we can see this.
[02:36:47.162 --> 02:36:48.023]  You can pull up this document.
[02:36:48.043 --> 02:36:54.390]  That methodology is crooked, but when you're doing 47% Democrats, 27% Republicans, what the hell do you think is going to happen?
[02:36:54.510 --> 02:36:54.930]  Exactly.
[02:36:55.371 --> 02:36:56.732]  And like you said, she's still going to win.
[02:36:56.752 --> 02:37:04.861]  If I have a scale and I put 40-something rocks of the same weight in it, is it going to be heavier than the same size each weight 20-something?
[02:37:05.221 --> 02:37:07.003]  Which one's heavier, 40-something or 20-something?
[02:37:07.924 --> 02:37:10.485]  And she still barely wins.
[02:37:10.505 --> 02:37:11.985]  11 points.
[02:37:12.886 --> 02:37:18.267]  This is like, I mean, I wonder if you actually just pulled Democrats.
[02:37:18.687 --> 02:37:20.588]  I wonder what the results are.
[02:37:20.608 --> 02:37:20.928]  Absolutely.
[02:37:20.948 --> 02:37:23.389]  Here's one Politico busted with a rigged poll against Trump.
[02:37:24.363 --> 02:37:26.044]  Clifford Cunningham, Infowars.com.
[02:37:26.444 --> 02:37:28.044]  And then it goes over how they did this as well.
[02:37:28.064 --> 02:37:36.967]  According to a recent conducted by Politico, which sampled 2001 registered voters, 42% thought Hillary Clinton was the winner of the debate compared to 28%.
[02:37:37.687 --> 02:37:43.049]  Although large sample size may make the poll seem seemingly accurate to some, the methodology tells a different story.
[02:37:43.649 --> 02:37:49.071]  According to the polls methodology, 37% of those samples are Democrats, compared to 30% who consider themselves Republicans.
[02:37:49.471 --> 02:37:53.973]  The remaining 33% are independents, and that's where they really get you, because they sample in the demographic.
[02:37:53.993 --> 02:37:57.774]  It's like CNN says, oh, you're a Democrat, you're a Republican, we'll call you back.
[02:37:57.974 --> 02:38:01.075]  Well, who's been given the number of 500 respondents to call back?
[02:38:01.395 --> 02:38:07.478]  And then CNN admits they poll, again, 40-something percent Democrats over 27% Republicans.
[02:38:07.518 --> 02:38:08.538]  This is ridiculous!
[02:38:09.078 --> 02:38:10.999]  This is, I mean, what type of idiot would believe this?
[02:38:11.559 --> 02:38:13.981]  The oversampling of Democrats indicates a built-in 7%.
[02:38:14.061 --> 02:38:17.503]  So this is more fair by Politico.
[02:38:17.783 --> 02:38:19.184]  They only put a 7% more in.
[02:38:20.024 --> 02:38:22.006]  Which, I mean, that's like a football game.
[02:38:22.206 --> 02:38:27.749]  If you said, well, the Cowboys, we're going to lose by 3 points, but we gave them an extra 7, so it's okay they won.
[02:38:27.969 --> 02:38:29.210]  It's okay they just cheated by 7%, right?
[02:38:29.230 --> 02:38:30.431]  Yeah, that's fine.
[02:38:30.731 --> 02:38:31.311]  We don't mind that.
[02:38:32.132 --> 02:38:33.132]  We don't want a fair match.
[02:38:34.053 --> 02:38:35.114]  Why would we want a fair match?
[02:38:36.021 --> 02:38:37.002]  This is an American election.
[02:38:37.022 --> 02:38:40.043]  There's no rigged election going on here, according to Barack Obama.
[02:38:40.063 --> 02:38:42.044]  Even the Department of Justice is going to investigate.
[02:38:42.064 --> 02:38:44.045]  Well, and then it goes into more, exactly.
[02:38:44.185 --> 02:38:47.527]  It goes into more of how they skew other stuff in the same poll.
[02:38:47.547 --> 02:38:49.088]  But just 7% is one way they do it.
[02:38:49.428 --> 02:38:50.109]  Then they do it other ways.
[02:38:50.149 --> 02:38:51.209]  Now, let me ask this question.
[02:38:51.229 --> 02:38:52.270]  Who's getting polled, though?
[02:38:52.350 --> 02:38:53.851]  Who are these people being polled?
[02:38:53.871 --> 02:38:54.391]  I've never been polled.
[02:38:54.411 --> 02:38:54.851]  Have you been polled?
[02:38:55.952 --> 02:38:57.793]  Has any one of the staff ever been polled in one of these?
[02:38:58.698 --> 02:39:05.560]  I've had one phone call years ago, and as soon as I said I was a Libertarian, the computer hung up.
[02:39:05.580 --> 02:39:07.020]  As soon as I punched that number.
[02:39:07.040 --> 02:39:07.820]  That's also how they skew it.
[02:39:07.840 --> 02:39:09.160]  They pre-program these, a lot of them.
[02:39:09.320 --> 02:39:18.322]  This has come out in the news, where if it isn't what you want, a certain percentage of Republicans or Libertarians, they hang up on and claim, oh, it disconnected to re-sample till the computer gets the number it wants.
[02:39:18.562 --> 02:39:21.623]  So you put an algorithm in, then the computer will just call people till it gets what it wants.
[02:39:21.743 --> 02:39:23.403]  Yeah, you're just getting the desired result.
[02:39:23.503 --> 02:39:25.964]  It'll call and call and call until it gets what it wants.
[02:39:26.764 --> 02:39:29.365]  And that's how hacking, that's how a hacking program works.
[02:39:29.385 --> 02:39:31.565]  They don't like go in after the election and do it.
[02:39:32.126 --> 02:39:33.386]  They put an algorithm in.
[02:39:34.166 --> 02:39:35.807]  What are we going to do when they steal this election?
[02:39:36.247 --> 02:39:38.187]  You know, we should have the next 27 days every day.
[02:39:38.528 --> 02:39:40.048]  Just only talk about that.
[02:39:40.108 --> 02:39:41.208]  We should probably only talk about that.
[02:39:41.288 --> 02:39:43.029]  This is what, I mean, this is what I'm going to do.
[02:39:43.049 --> 02:39:44.609]  People ask what the October surprise is.
[02:39:44.669 --> 02:39:45.170]  It's the truth.
[02:39:46.110 --> 02:39:47.890]  They stole other elections.
[02:39:47.910 --> 02:39:49.371]  They're actively stealing this one.
[02:39:50.399 --> 02:39:51.200]  I told Trump.
[02:39:51.380 --> 02:39:52.001]  Other people had it.
[02:39:52.021 --> 02:39:52.481]  He's smart.
[02:39:52.521 --> 02:39:53.162]  He talked to experts.
[02:39:53.182 --> 02:39:53.722]  He went public.
[02:39:54.043 --> 02:39:54.763]  There's election fraud.
[02:39:54.783 --> 02:39:56.144]  They came out and said, no such thing exists.
[02:39:56.185 --> 02:39:57.486]  And they said, oh my God, it's so bad.
[02:39:57.866 --> 02:39:58.887]  We've got to federalize it.
[02:39:59.147 --> 02:40:00.489]  Homeland Security's in there right now.
[02:40:00.509 --> 02:40:02.590]  The Democrats are running around stealing the election.
[02:40:03.339 --> 02:40:03.759]  What do we do?
[02:40:04.139 --> 02:40:12.844]  I don't know if you've heard about this, but what do you think about, I call for all Donald Trump voters on November 8th to be decked out in red.
[02:40:13.164 --> 02:40:19.967]  And then if you go to the polling place, everyone's wearing red, not even close, and then they claim it's Hillary, we will have caught them.
[02:40:20.207 --> 02:40:20.588]  It's a great idea.
[02:40:20.608 --> 02:40:23.049]  Well, you know, because they're the liberals in Loving, it's okay that they cheat.
[02:40:23.089 --> 02:40:25.530]  And we've kind of gotten to the point where we know they're cheating.
[02:40:25.610 --> 02:40:26.391]  Do we start cheating?
[02:40:27.671 --> 02:40:28.111]  That's fair.
[02:40:28.151 --> 02:40:28.912]  That's not cheating though.
[02:40:29.824 --> 02:40:31.025]  There's nothing illegal about that.
[02:40:31.145 --> 02:40:33.306]  I mean, I've gotten to the point where... They'll call it cheating, though.
[02:40:33.526 --> 02:40:33.846]  They will.
[02:40:34.507 --> 02:40:35.667]  Well, I don't want to stoop to their level.
[02:40:35.687 --> 02:40:37.308]  I want to expose them for cheating and stop it.
[02:40:39.229 --> 02:40:47.194]  But if they get rid of the ballot box, then I guess they're going to force people into the garbage box.
[02:40:47.814 --> 02:40:52.377]  And I don't want the garbage box, but they actively want to come arrest us, put us in prison, shut us down.
[02:40:52.777 --> 02:40:57.780]  So at a certain point, I guess the candy asses want to dance.
[02:40:58.848 --> 02:41:04.353]  I mean, unless they wake up and realize what's going on, I don't know what else we can do.
[02:41:04.373 --> 02:41:05.154]  What am I supposed to do?
[02:41:05.855 --> 02:41:06.796]  Here's the thing, Alex.
[02:41:07.216 --> 02:41:08.437]  We're fighting for America.
[02:41:08.477 --> 02:41:09.458]  We're fighting for freedom.
[02:41:09.819 --> 02:41:13.122]  And we don't want these social justice warriors in our way.
[02:41:13.162 --> 02:41:14.443]  They're actually on our team.
[02:41:14.503 --> 02:41:17.226]  Unfortunately, they're scoring for the other team, but they're on our team.
[02:41:17.526 --> 02:41:18.387]  I don't want to have to run them down.
[02:41:18.407 --> 02:41:19.547]  Yeah, they're getting screwed over by the New World Order.
[02:41:19.567 --> 02:41:20.248]  They're getting screwed over.
[02:41:20.468 --> 02:41:20.848]  Absolutely.
[02:41:20.908 --> 02:41:22.029]  I don't want to run them over.
[02:41:22.109 --> 02:41:23.530]  I don't want to fight with you.
[02:41:24.090 --> 02:41:25.071]  You're in my way!
[02:41:25.411 --> 02:41:26.412]  Move, bitch!
[02:41:26.692 --> 02:41:27.713]  Get out the way!
[02:41:27.773 --> 02:41:28.353]  That's what it is!
[02:41:30.606 --> 02:41:31.487]  You see them headlights?
[02:41:31.507 --> 02:41:32.668]  I like the curtain down!
[02:41:51.767 --> 02:41:54.148]  Yet where do they go for their answers in this election?
[02:41:54.368 --> 02:41:58.169]  The mainstream media and Hillary Clinton, who's been in the government for 30 years.
[02:41:58.189 --> 02:42:01.969]  And they feel validated because the big mommy media told them so.
[02:42:02.049 --> 02:42:05.130]  So they're like, you're in trouble, I'm tattling.
[02:42:05.830 --> 02:42:09.431]  Even Megyn Kelly debuted the Trump video showing how he touches people.
[02:42:09.451 --> 02:42:12.012]  Even Megyn Kelly, oh my goodness, even her!
[02:42:12.972 --> 02:42:14.514]  Did you read People Magazine?
[02:42:14.534 --> 02:42:15.995]  I want to play some of this, but we've got to go to calls.
[02:42:16.456 --> 02:42:18.478]  Briefly, folks, this is a listener-supported broadcast.
[02:42:18.718 --> 02:42:23.383]  We have incredible supplements, vitamins, minerals, nutraceuticals, info, warslife.com.

[02:42:33.912 --> 02:42:34.973]  You can actually make claims on this product.
[02:42:34.993 --> 02:42:35.573]  It's so incredible.
[02:42:35.873 --> 02:42:39.015]  All the stuff we put on it's patented and sold as drugs, but legal.
[02:42:39.295 --> 02:42:39.755]  You understand?
[02:42:39.775 --> 02:42:43.197]  Not prescription, like BioPQQ in Europe and things.
[02:42:43.497 --> 02:42:47.620]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:42:47.640 --> 02:42:48.560]  That ends today.
[02:42:48.580 --> 02:42:49.380]  Seven years in the making.
[02:42:52.731 --> 02:42:52.791]  I'm
[02:43:13.592 --> 02:43:14.792]  Whatever the case may be, we've got it.
[02:43:14.972 --> 02:43:20.214]  We've got our big industrial cold room at 60 degrees, shipped with a cold pack to you.
[02:43:20.534 --> 02:43:26.176]  You don't lose too much if it warms up, but you need to get in the refrigerator as soon as you get it for maximum effect.
[02:43:26.236 --> 02:43:31.837]  It's loaded with other enzymes and things for the probiotics to feed on, get through your gut.
[02:43:32.257 --> 02:43:40.540]  So the little paratroopers, the little good guy cells, the little good guys, they all have a little backpack of goodies with them when we send the troops in.
[02:43:41.340 --> 02:43:43.462]  We don't send a bunch of starving or dead troops in.
[02:43:43.702 --> 02:43:44.783]  We send in the highest quality.
[02:43:44.823 --> 02:43:49.227]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:43:49.487 --> 02:43:54.932]  We'll stop selling the Hillary for Prison shirt that we coined a year and a half ago in T-minus 27 days.
[02:43:55.072 --> 02:43:58.796]  Alright, Sherry, holding for a while from the great state of Texas.
[02:43:59.296 --> 02:44:00.537]  Sherry, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:44:00.577 --> 02:44:00.898]  Go ahead.
[02:44:01.678 --> 02:44:02.479]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:44:02.919 --> 02:44:05.582]  Here's an example of how important Wikileaks is to us.
[02:44:06.101 --> 02:44:12.003]  And it also helps further explain why the authorities moved... Listen, it's so important I want you to get off speakerphone.
[02:44:12.023 --> 02:44:12.863]  I know you've been holding it a while.
[02:44:12.883 --> 02:44:13.363]  You're a sweetheart.
[02:44:13.383 --> 02:44:17.344]  I'm going to send you a free Hillary for Presidents shirt, because you held so long it was your name and address.
[02:44:18.004 --> 02:44:21.765]  Or you can have the new one that's the Gadsden flag, Lock Her Up shirt, by the way.
[02:44:21.785 --> 02:44:23.966]  But, ma'am, please get off speakerphone.
[02:44:24.906 --> 02:44:25.306]  Okay.
[02:44:26.146 --> 02:44:26.786]  Here I am.
[02:44:26.926 --> 02:44:27.226]  Good.
[02:44:27.246 --> 02:44:28.027]  You got me?
[02:44:28.087 --> 02:44:28.427]  Good.
[02:44:28.487 --> 02:44:30.067]  Alright.
[02:44:30.627 --> 02:44:31.608]  Can you hear me, Alex?
[02:44:31.848 --> 02:44:32.208]  Good.
[02:44:34.665 --> 02:44:46.076]  Here's an example of how important WikiLeaks is to us, and it further explains what you were talking about the other day about why the authorities wanted to remove Gandhi's statue from a churchyard.
[02:44:47.518 --> 02:44:48.418]  Are you with me, Alex?
[02:44:48.779 --> 02:44:51.341]  Ma'am, I am absolutely with you.
[02:44:51.401 --> 02:44:52.402]  I just wanted you to get off speaker.
[02:44:52.422 --> 02:44:54.805]  Just to make sure, I am off the speaker.
[02:44:55.580 --> 02:44:56.481]  No, I know you are.
[02:44:56.642 --> 02:44:57.022]  I know.
[02:44:57.363 --> 02:44:58.284]  So we can hear you clearly.
[02:44:58.324 --> 02:45:01.790]  I said just jump off speaker and we hear you clear and you hear me clear, right?
[02:45:02.010 --> 02:45:03.712]  Yeah, I gotcha.
[02:45:04.253 --> 02:45:05.034]  I was my mistake.
[02:45:05.075 --> 02:45:05.435]  I'm sorry.
[02:45:05.455 --> 02:45:05.996]  I forgot.
[02:45:06.036 --> 02:45:06.897]  It's okay.
[02:45:07.038 --> 02:45:08.119]  We'll go as long as you want.
[02:45:08.179 --> 02:45:09.842]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[02:45:09.862 --> 02:45:10.343]  Okay, thanks.
[02:45:11.053 --> 02:45:14.715]  It also answers how we can fight back, at least in my opinion, it's the best way.
[02:45:15.236 --> 02:45:18.117]  Last month I decided to see a movie I had taped a long time ago.
[02:45:18.157 --> 02:45:25.422]  It's the night of the movie Gandhi, the 1982 movie Gandhi, with Ben Kingsley as the star.
[02:45:25.962 --> 02:45:28.384]  And I started taking notes immediately.
[02:45:28.404 --> 02:45:31.225]  He was a simple lawyer, as people know, and he became a leader.
[02:45:34.257 --> 02:45:40.287]  Of India and a symbol of peace and all this at a time when the British administration had taken over the country.
[02:45:40.748 --> 02:45:45.094]  They were going through exactly what we are going through and will go through.
[02:45:45.974 --> 02:45:48.155]  If things keep going like that.
[02:45:48.175 --> 02:45:56.137]  Sure, and look, whether you love Gandhi or don't, you're right that they want to take a statue down because notice one day it's a Confederate general, now it's Gandhi.
[02:45:56.637 --> 02:46:02.298]  Now at major colleges they want Martin Luther King taken down because he said, all God's children of every color.
[02:46:02.939 --> 02:46:05.279]  Well, you didn't say transgender or gay.
[02:46:05.619 --> 02:46:06.620]  How the hell are you supposed to?
[02:46:07.060 --> 02:46:08.720]  They want the power to control language.
[02:46:08.760 --> 02:46:09.460]  It's not liberal.
[02:46:09.900 --> 02:46:11.221]  It's scientifically directed.
[02:46:11.241 --> 02:46:11.561]  Go ahead.
[02:46:12.741 --> 02:46:15.242]  Gandhi had some things to say to the British administration.
[02:46:17.677 --> 02:46:20.839]  The people cannot tolerate injustice from Hitler or anyone.
[02:46:21.319 --> 02:46:21.920]  That's a quote.
[02:46:22.220 --> 02:46:25.963]  And to combat injustice, make the injustice visible.
[02:46:26.163 --> 02:46:27.904]  That's pretty common to a lot of people.
[02:46:28.124 --> 02:46:28.965]  But he went on.
[02:46:29.265 --> 02:46:33.448]  He was also questioned about the poor and about combating poverty.
[02:46:34.068 --> 02:46:40.172]  And he said, quote, poverty can be removed if his people's skills can be revived.
[02:46:40.492 --> 02:46:43.634]  In other words, no direct Wall Street connection.
[02:46:43.975 --> 02:46:44.215]  No.
[02:46:44.555 --> 02:46:46.816]  I mean, of course he knew that a lot of stuff he said was good.
[02:46:46.856 --> 02:46:47.417]  And he, by the way,
[02:46:48.217 --> 02:46:51.939]  Because Hitler was into Eastern mysticism and into Buddhism and things.
[02:46:51.959 --> 02:46:55.781]  I know Gandhi was a Hindi, but the point is, they were pen pals.
[02:46:55.941 --> 02:46:59.923]  Because Hitler was like Mr. America, good guy in our news, a eugenicist.
[02:47:00.323 --> 02:47:02.184]  Gandhi started talking to Hitler a lot in letters.
[02:47:02.844 --> 02:47:09.987]  And there's famous letters, he wrote them at the end saying, I can't support you, you're really being bad doing this, and you're going to get destroyed, Germany will fall, you're crazy.
[02:47:10.627 --> 02:47:11.488]  Gandhi was really smart.
[02:47:12.088 --> 02:47:14.450]  Some of the stuff he was into was a little weird, but hey, whatever.
[02:47:14.470 --> 02:47:16.131]  He was a visionary, a trailblazer.
[02:47:16.171 --> 02:47:16.751]  I agree with you.
[02:47:17.532 --> 02:47:23.395]  Gandhi University, them pulling down his statue, is again about every symbol hurts somebody's feelings.
[02:47:23.435 --> 02:47:24.056]  Let's get rid of it.
[02:47:24.156 --> 02:47:25.216]  I appreciate your call, Sherry.
[02:47:25.837 --> 02:47:36.744]  And now they've got control over the internet and the UN level, so what are you going to do when they try to block you or say that you're... Which is now starting, and as soon as Hillary gets in... I'm sure the UN will answer.
[02:47:36.784 --> 02:47:39.385]  I'm sure if you try to reach out to the UN, they'll get right back to you with that.
[02:47:39.405 --> 02:47:40.266]  There'll be no problems there.
[02:47:41.561 --> 02:47:42.222]  That's amazing.
[02:47:42.762 --> 02:47:44.764]  Let's go ahead and go to Matt in Maryland.
[02:47:44.784 --> 02:47:45.765]  Thanks for holding your trooper.
[02:47:46.086 --> 02:47:52.492]  I'm going to send you a free Hillary for prison or the limited edition lock her up Gadsden flag snake.
[02:47:53.783 --> 02:47:57.784]  Actually suppressing Hillary, it's not hurting her, it's lovingly coiled up around her.
[02:47:58.044 --> 02:48:02.085]  In fact if I was liberal I'd say the snake's not hurting her in the photo, it's lovingly keeping her warm.
[02:48:02.366 --> 02:48:03.506]  That's what boa constrictors do.
[02:48:04.086 --> 02:48:09.308]  Giant rattlesnake boa constrictors that are just as real as Obamacare being free.
[02:48:09.648 --> 02:48:12.509]  That shirt, so we're going to send you that for holding for an hour and a half, go ahead.
[02:48:13.629 --> 02:48:14.029]  Well thanks.
[02:48:14.589 --> 02:48:20.631]  Well I was online yesterday and I seen this video going around, it's of a local
[02:48:21.818 --> 02:48:24.801]  New York News Station, WPIX11.
[02:48:25.141 --> 02:48:37.291]  It's got, uh, three news anchors on there, and they're, like, they're goofing around with one of those, you know, those old, uh, turn camera, digital cameras, uh, that you snap.
[02:48:37.611 --> 02:48:38.612]  I mean, disposable ones.
[02:48:38.792 --> 02:48:39.533]  Disposable ones.
[02:48:40.353 --> 02:48:43.276]  And they were snapping pictures of each other with the flash coming across.
[02:48:44.577 --> 02:48:48.080]  And then the one anchor said, yeah, these are banned from, uh,
[02:48:48.888 --> 02:48:53.211]  Take our service that we're not allowed to use these because of bring on Hillary Clinton's seizure.
[02:48:57.553 --> 02:48:59.114]  And I mean he was probably being tongue-in-cheek.
[02:48:59.134 --> 02:49:00.615]  They have told don't have flash around her.
[02:49:00.675 --> 02:49:01.436]  That is going on.
[02:49:01.476 --> 02:49:02.397]  She does have seizures.
[02:49:02.917 --> 02:49:07.059]  But were they just pointing that out to their audience or that it actually happened to them?
[02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:08.260]  On air.
[02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:11.122]  I actually had the video recorded and put on YouTube.
[02:49:11.622 --> 02:49:12.223]  Wow, great.
[02:49:12.263 --> 02:49:15.065]  What's the name of the YouTube channel or the name of the video?
[02:49:15.105 --> 02:49:15.605]  We'll pull it up.
[02:49:16.767 --> 02:49:21.679]  It's... Well, the name of the video is Seeker Service Bans Cameras With Flash.
[02:49:23.602 --> 02:49:24.262]  Well, that's big.
[02:49:24.302 --> 02:49:25.103]  We need to get that.
[02:49:25.123 --> 02:49:26.024]  That's certainly newsworthy.
[02:49:26.064 --> 02:49:27.505]  That's why it's so important you called in.
[02:49:27.845 --> 02:49:29.706]  I haven't gotten to this yet, and I should have.
[02:49:30.347 --> 02:49:33.409]  We actually have a clip of Hillary and the N-word.
[02:49:34.350 --> 02:49:40.094]  Hillary described using the N-word, W-B-E-N, 930 AM, Buffalo, New York.
[02:49:40.714 --> 02:49:49.880]  And this is the chef, Tracy Martin, on the show, talking about during Clinton's first term, he describes her using the N-word in an interview.
[02:49:49.901 --> 02:49:51.502]  We're going to play that coming up.
[02:49:52.082 --> 02:49:56.486]  But listen, it's well known Hillary uses that term.
[02:49:56.766 --> 02:50:00.490]  I've talked to folks that were basically her handler.
[02:50:00.870 --> 02:50:02.291]  She's very racist.
[02:50:03.252 --> 02:50:05.654]  And again, it's all about betrayal.
[02:50:05.774 --> 02:50:13.161]  I mean, if I'm going to use the N-word, which I never have, I'm going to use it to your face.
[02:50:13.361 --> 02:50:14.222]  It's just Democrats
[02:50:15.697 --> 02:50:15.857]  I don't
[02:50:36.155 --> 02:50:42.660]  We get Infowarriors to go to Hillary Clinton rallies, she's got four coming up before the next debate, and start taking pictures!
[02:50:42.860 --> 02:50:44.101]  Get the flash out, take a picture!
[02:50:44.181 --> 02:50:48.184]  I don't want you to induce a seizure, I'm not saying that we want Hillary to- The Secret Service might arrest you for assault!
[02:50:48.344 --> 02:50:52.867]  Expose how she's sick, and that you can't even have a flash at a rally because she's sick!
[02:50:52.987 --> 02:50:56.512]  Consciously, but they can say, no, she does have epilepsy from the brain tumor.
[02:50:56.552 --> 02:50:57.894]  You're consciously trying to make her have a seizure.
[02:50:58.255 --> 02:50:59.777]  That is a form of assault, but I get your point.
[02:51:00.037 --> 02:51:01.580]  They say she doesn't have it, so it's not a problem.
[02:51:01.620 --> 02:51:02.341]  So we'll expose it.
[02:51:02.681 --> 02:51:07.388]  Everybody should try to get into rallies with it and get them recorded with audio saying you can't have a flash camera.
[02:51:07.989 --> 02:51:08.870]  Thank you so much, Matt.
[02:51:08.890 --> 02:51:09.271]  Great point.
[02:51:09.989 --> 02:51:11.431]  Folks, the message is clear.
[02:51:11.812 --> 02:51:13.033]  The parallels are there.
[02:51:13.314 --> 02:51:24.849]  There are millions of ordinary Americans who've been let down, who've had a bad time, who feel the political class in Washington are detached from them, who feel so many of their representatives are
[02:51:24.929 --> 02:51:25.289]  You can go out.
[02:51:25.309 --> 02:51:26.990]  You can beat the pollsters.
[02:51:27.050 --> 02:51:28.871]  You can beat the commentators.
[02:51:29.291 --> 02:51:30.612]  You can beat Washington.
[02:51:49.781 --> 02:51:54.406]  Mr. Farage, you just recently resigned as the head of UKIP, still in the EU Parliament.
[02:51:54.946 --> 02:51:55.267]  Wow!
[02:51:55.327 --> 02:51:57.369]  Talk about a David vs. Goliath story.
[02:51:57.709 --> 02:51:58.990]  This is epic.
[02:51:59.010 --> 02:52:10.322]  What it is, and I think the point about Brexit, Alex, is Brexit is the first victory against this phenomenon of the big banks, the big businesses, effectively owning politics.
[02:52:11.202 --> 02:52:15.163]  Literally willfully destroying nation-state democracy.
[02:52:15.223 --> 02:52:23.246]  Getting rid of that thing that our forebears actually fought and shed their blood to create and to preserve our liberties, our freedoms.
[02:52:23.446 --> 02:52:31.368]  All of that being taken away and suddenly, suddenly in a referendum that no one said we could win.
[02:52:31.448 --> 02:52:36.489]  I mean literally nobody thought Brexit would succeed and we've done it.
[02:52:37.249 --> 02:52:38.690]  Hillary represents
[02:52:39.742 --> 02:52:43.744]  Everything that has gone wrong in our lives in the last couple of decades.
[02:52:44.304 --> 02:52:57.251]  She is part, you know, of that class of people who have taken us into an endless series of foreign wars that I think arguably have made things worse, certainly in Liberia and elsewhere, not better.
[02:52:58.071 --> 02:52:59.652]  She is part of that phenomenon.
[02:53:00.353 --> 02:53:04.235]  Where all that seems to matter now is corporatism.
[02:53:04.576 --> 02:53:12.380]  You know, the big global companies who want to set the rule books to effectively put out of business small and medium-sized competitors.
[02:53:12.880 --> 02:53:22.026]  They have destroyed, you know, what I believe to be proper free market capitalism, where your eye can go and set up a company, you know, and have a real chance of succeeding.
[02:53:22.586 --> 02:53:31.634]  And they've presided over a period where the rich have got richer, and where ordinary, decent, working people have seen their living standards deteriorate.
[02:53:31.994 --> 02:53:33.736]  She represents failure.
[02:53:33.936 --> 02:53:39.180]  And she, of course, is completely unreconciled to the vote on Brexit.
[02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:41.282]  Because Hillary loves the European Union.
[02:53:41.623 --> 02:53:47.668]  I think she sees the European Union as a prototype for an even bigger form of world government.
[02:53:47.808 --> 02:53:48.949]  But let me make it clear.
[02:53:49.745 --> 02:54:04.061]  If you want nothing to change at all, if you want to continue with the kind of cronyism that we see with the Clinton Foundation and everything else, if you want things to stay the same, you vote for Hillary.
[02:54:04.482 --> 02:54:08.667]  I wouldn't vote for Hillary if she paid me, and I feel pretty strongly about that.
[02:54:30.214 --> 02:54:32.595]  Well, it's the top story on Infowars.com.
[02:54:32.635 --> 02:54:34.696]  It's the top story on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:54:34.716 --> 02:54:45.979]  We've been discussing it here live and all the other insanity going on with the head of New York elections saying, oh, the party people, the Democrats, who's a Democrat, bus people around to vote over and over again, but we're not going to stop it.
[02:54:45.999 --> 02:54:47.420]  You know, I don't like it, but it's just the way it is.
[02:54:47.460 --> 02:54:53.642]  And yeah, you know, they're stuffing the ballots, you know, right now in Florida for Hillary to win, but that's been reported in Florida.
[02:54:55.017 --> 02:54:58.560]  Meanwhile, Banish, the untold story of Danny Williams' search for his father.
[02:54:59.001 --> 02:55:01.863]  Danny tries to reconnect with his reported father, Bill Clinton.
[02:55:02.364 --> 02:55:03.525]  That's the headline I gave it.
[02:55:03.665 --> 02:55:06.207]  Kit posted it, he did a great job, but we probably should just go with Drudge.
[02:55:06.527 --> 02:55:15.075]  He's so good at, you know, headlines and really condensing all of this down to what it really is.
[02:55:15.775 --> 02:55:17.197]  Bill Clinton's son speaks out.
[02:55:18.800 --> 02:55:25.565]  So we'll probably just retweet that Facebook that with Bill Clinton's son, in quotes, speaks out.
[02:55:27.330 --> 02:55:28.330]  Ask for a DNA test.
[02:55:28.350 --> 02:55:29.991]  That's even a more powerful headline.
[02:55:30.451 --> 02:55:31.471]  Because that's what's going on.
[02:55:31.491 --> 02:55:32.451]  We're taking phone calls.
[02:55:33.372 --> 02:55:36.612]  We've got Owen Schroyer here, one of our co-hosts, with us.
[02:55:36.692 --> 02:55:43.874]  We're going to ride a little bit in the next hour with David Knight, play a boil-down of some of the craziness that he saw at the debate in St.
[02:55:43.934 --> 02:55:44.254]  Louis.
[02:55:44.695 --> 02:55:45.555]  And continue with your calls.
[02:55:45.595 --> 02:55:47.355]  And we've got some Patriots coming in today as well.
[02:55:47.375 --> 02:55:49.916]  And we've got the Not Only News coming up tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[02:55:51.115 --> 02:55:54.617]  Other big surprises tomorrow.
[02:55:54.657 --> 02:55:55.537]  You'll want to tune in.
[02:55:56.257 --> 02:55:58.138]  Please support the broadcast, as I mentioned earlier.
[02:55:58.398 --> 02:56:00.879]  DNA Force, 23% off that sale ends tonight.
[02:56:00.899 --> 02:56:02.480]  A lot of other great specials.

[02:56:08.783 --> 02:56:10.403]  The whole world goes around because you're supporting us.
[02:56:10.643 --> 02:56:11.464]  You are the InfoWar.
[02:56:11.524 --> 02:56:12.104]  I salute you.
[02:56:12.444 --> 02:56:13.825]  Anything you want to add before we go to Luke in Florida?
[02:56:14.945 --> 02:56:19.086]  Again, I think we should all wear red on November 8th to make sure they don't steal the election from us.
[02:56:19.366 --> 02:56:24.388]  And the rally, Trump rally in Wilkes, Pennsylvania last night almost had me in tears.
[02:56:24.468 --> 02:56:25.188]  It was so powerful.
[02:56:25.768 --> 02:56:29.209]  Well, we need to post that whole rally and maybe have you do the highlights of it or something for the news.
[02:56:29.229 --> 02:56:30.290]  You know, get some clips.
[02:56:30.330 --> 02:56:31.150]  The whole thing, man.
[02:56:31.210 --> 02:56:38.332]  I mean, it's just... If Donald Trump is for real, folks, he is the greatest American hero
[02:56:39.728 --> 02:56:41.370]  In hundreds of years.
[02:56:41.730 --> 02:56:42.791]  And he's gone through living hell.
[02:56:43.051 --> 02:56:43.632]  He's the man in the area.
[02:56:43.652 --> 02:56:49.878]  He is going through public torture right now for this country in every debate and every day in the mainstream news.
[02:56:49.898 --> 02:56:51.420]  Let's go back to these great callers, Alex.
[02:56:52.081 --> 02:56:53.182]  I was telling him to put the camera down.
[02:56:53.522 --> 02:56:54.543]  I'm not telling you to stop.
[02:56:54.643 --> 02:56:57.746]  No, no, I know, but... I have this headroom obsession, being too much headroom.
[02:56:58.747 --> 02:57:00.329]  I'm here directing the show while we're doing things.
[02:57:00.649 --> 02:57:02.190]  Hold on, hold on, the Russians are giving orders.
[02:57:02.530 --> 02:57:04.530]  Vladimir, what are... What's that?
[02:57:05.171 --> 02:57:06.151]  The Jews are in my ear.
[02:57:06.191 --> 02:57:09.032]  Hold on, you've got too many news facts on your desk.
[02:57:09.052 --> 02:57:09.512]  They did it.
[02:57:10.153 --> 02:57:11.633]  As if anyone could direct the circus.
[02:57:12.814 --> 02:57:15.575]  You didn't even know the reports that we were working on in St.
[02:57:15.595 --> 02:57:15.815]  Louis.
[02:57:15.855 --> 02:57:17.215]  I'm telling you, you give me complete freedom.
[02:57:17.255 --> 02:57:17.855]  Well, how can I?
[02:57:17.895 --> 02:57:19.296]  I'm busy with the October surprises.
[02:57:19.536 --> 02:57:20.136]  I don't know, Alex.
[02:57:20.156 --> 02:57:23.257]  You've only got, let's see, 5,000 news stories on your desk.
[02:57:23.317 --> 02:57:24.118]  I get about 100 articles a day.
[02:57:24.138 --> 02:57:24.758]  There's like 300 I didn't get to.
[02:57:29.506 --> 02:57:34.654]  Every WikiLeak, we have the total proof she lied again to Congress and was being paid by foreign governments.
[02:57:34.914 --> 02:57:38.059]  But she won't get locked up because the damn criminal put all her people in!
[02:57:39.051 --> 02:57:53.417]  I don't know who could do this, but if somebody can get a piece of Bill Clinton's hair or dead skin or something, we can run the DNA test independently with Danny Williams, prove that Bill Clinton... Sure, but they'll claim the providence and the evidence shamelessly.
[02:57:53.698 --> 02:57:54.678]  Imagine this, Alex.
[02:57:55.018 --> 02:58:01.361]  Webb Hubble gets a DNA test with Chelsea, and Danny Williams gets a DNA test with
[02:58:01.681 --> 02:58:14.972]  By the way, reportedly, for whatever reason, the Israelis wanted to blackmail Bush or something, and others, whenever he would go to foreign countries, they were having people get in the sewer, and they were guessing times, he went to the bathroom, and then opened the sewer pipes to get the... I'm not suggesting anybody does that.
[02:58:14.992 --> 02:58:15.292]  No, no, no, no.
[02:58:15.533 --> 02:58:17.975]  And Bush... Monica has a dress you might want to look at.
[02:58:19.056 --> 02:58:19.316]  Pardon me?
[02:58:19.336 --> 02:58:23.559]  I said Monica has a dress that... Monica has a dress!
[02:58:23.579 --> 02:58:24.660]  Oh, Monica's dress!
[02:58:24.780 --> 02:58:28.964]  Exactly, but expanding on that, Bush then started having a portable toilet taken with him.
[02:58:29.895 --> 02:58:31.136]  He had to bring a toilet along with him?
[02:58:31.156 --> 02:58:31.917]  Nah, I'm not kidding.
[02:58:31.937 --> 02:58:32.277]  You can Google it.
[02:58:32.297 --> 02:58:34.439]  I'm surprised he's not just crapping in a bag or something.
[02:58:35.579 --> 02:58:36.460]  Throwing it at each other.
[02:58:36.940 --> 02:58:37.461]  More flies.
[02:58:37.481 --> 02:58:38.462]  Oh, that's Bohemian Grove.
[02:58:38.482 --> 02:58:39.022]  That's Bohemian Grove.
[02:58:39.042 --> 02:58:40.303]  No, that's Skull and Bones.
[02:58:41.444 --> 02:58:43.145]  They pee on each other at Bohemian Grove.
[02:58:43.185 --> 02:58:44.907]  Skull and Bones as they wallow in the feces.
[02:58:45.287 --> 02:58:45.907]  I'm sorry, folks.
[02:58:45.927 --> 02:58:47.869]  It's a child and children's show or whatever.
[02:58:47.929 --> 02:58:48.489]  Family show.
[02:58:48.509 --> 02:58:50.031]  But we're just reporting on reality now.
[02:58:50.511 --> 02:58:51.291]  And the Lord of the Flies.
[02:58:51.311 --> 02:58:54.194]  We're going to come back to Luke and others in 70 seconds.
[02:58:54.214 --> 02:58:55.515]  Hour number four straight ahead.
[02:58:55.855 --> 02:58:56.796]  This is the InfoWar.
[02:58:59.770 --> 02:59:00.791]  Brain Force is here.
[02:59:01.312 --> 02:59:03.594]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:59:03.875 --> 02:59:11.683]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[02:59:12.478 --> 02:59:16.040]  One of the worst things with most energy products, this is not sustainable, right?
[02:59:16.060 --> 02:59:18.402]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:59:18.762 --> 02:59:22.285]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:59:22.325 --> 02:59:25.487]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:59:25.967 --> 02:59:30.770]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:59:31.311 --> 02:59:33.152]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[02:59:33.492 --> 02:59:37.915]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:59:38.075 --> 02:59:40.097]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:59:40.717 --> 02:59:42.178]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:59:42.318 --> 02:59:42.558]  Exactly.
[02:59:42.578 --> 02:59:46.359]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:59:46.879 --> 02:59:53.761]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:53.781 --> 02:59:54.141]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:54.361 --> 02:59:56.061]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:13.507 --> 03:00:14.388]  Twenty-seven days.
[03:00:15.249 --> 03:00:16.631]  Twenty-seven.
[03:00:16.651 --> 03:00:17.392]  Twenty-seven.
[03:00:17.952 --> 03:00:18.874]  Twenty-seven.
[03:00:20.956 --> 03:00:26.002]  Before America can be great again, she must be great again.
[03:00:26.503 --> 03:00:29.166]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:33.849 --> 03:00:34.670]  Alright, I got a bunch of clips.
[03:00:34.690 --> 03:00:37.273]  They did a little joke piece with Hillary ribbiting now.
[03:00:37.293 --> 03:00:37.873]  She does ribbits.
[03:00:39.035 --> 03:00:40.556]  And then all her other stuff mixed in.
[03:00:40.576 --> 03:00:42.078]  That's coming up.
[03:00:42.578 --> 03:00:44.841]  Highlights of her confrontations with social justice warriors.
[03:00:45.842 --> 03:00:48.985]  That Rob Dewitt, it's not David Knight's coming in with these patriots that we had to bump, but they're great.
[03:00:49.005 --> 03:00:50.426]  They're milling out on the news tonight as well.
[03:00:51.522 --> 03:00:57.504]  Danny Williams' information, the reportedly illegitimate son of Bill Clinton, that exclusive.
[03:00:58.064 --> 03:01:00.885]  His message to his father, very powerful, is on Infowars.com.
[03:01:00.905 --> 03:01:03.005]  It's a top story on DredgeReport.com.
[03:01:03.045 --> 03:01:03.745]  Please get that out.
[03:01:04.466 --> 03:01:10.407]  And you will want to tune in tomorrow live during the show for more October surprises.
[03:01:11.328 --> 03:01:12.428]  Let's go ahead and go to Luke in Florida.
[03:01:12.468 --> 03:01:13.168]  Luke, thanks for holding.
[03:01:15.769 --> 03:01:15.989]  Hello?
[03:01:16.269 --> 03:01:16.489]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:18.069 --> 03:01:24.191]  Hey, I just wanted to bring up an observation from the debate.
[03:01:25.392 --> 03:01:36.615]  I was curious, why do you think Hillary Clinton had a second microphone, or what looked like a microphone, on her jacket when her and Trump both had handheld microphones?
[03:01:38.076 --> 03:01:38.976]  Trump had a lot too.
[03:01:39.276 --> 03:01:40.897]  That's just backup so they don't have problems.
[03:01:42.642 --> 03:01:47.944]  Alright, I was just wondering... But it's admitted that she's got to have somebody in her ear during speeches telling her what to do.
[03:01:47.984 --> 03:01:48.944]  That's in the new WikiLeaks.
[03:01:48.964 --> 03:01:53.545]  Because I also noticed that she had a nice comb over her ear with her hair.
[03:01:54.725 --> 03:01:55.426]  I noticed that too.
[03:01:55.446 --> 03:01:56.746]  Well, it looked like she had an earpiece before.
[03:01:57.106 --> 03:02:01.607]  Hell, she's got a secret service agent by her when somebody says something going, it's okay, keep going, it's alright, it's alright.
[03:02:01.647 --> 03:02:07.689]  I mean, she's definitely losing some of her mental capacities when she has these strokes, when she has these convulsions.
[03:02:07.969 --> 03:02:09.029]  She's out of it for a few days.
[03:02:09.049 --> 03:02:09.769]  Then she gets better.
[03:02:11.450 --> 03:02:11.750]  Yeah.
[03:02:12.512 --> 03:02:25.796]  The other thing was, I'm down here in the skin tag of the United States, Florida, and I was wondering, I want to put up some banners.
[03:02:27.356 --> 03:02:34.398]  What do you think is a good thing to put on banners that's short and sweet and that might encourage people to look into something?
[03:02:36.539 --> 03:02:38.499]  Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton are criminals.
[03:02:39.499 --> 03:02:40.940]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:02:43.305 --> 03:02:45.566]  You know, websites, Infowars.com, what do you think?
[03:02:46.506 --> 03:02:59.031]  You could use their own kind of brainwashing movements against them, and you could put up like a picture of Danny Williams and say, Black Lives Matter, look at Danny Williams, look at the crimes against Danny Williams, Black Lives Matter.
[03:02:59.111 --> 03:02:59.611]  Exactly!
[03:02:59.671 --> 03:03:05.834]  Hashtag BlackLivesMatterDannyWilliams, and everybody comes and sees our story and our video and him trying to get back with his father.
[03:03:05.994 --> 03:03:06.154]  Yeah.
[03:03:07.894 --> 03:03:11.976]  Yeah, because I was just trying to think of something that would
[03:03:12.918 --> 03:03:22.308]  You know, get people to at least, you know, if somebody spends 15 minutes, you know, just looking into stuff with, you know, outside their echo chamber, you know, they're going to wake up.
[03:03:23.088 --> 03:03:33.119]  You just have to get those people, you know, to spend 15, 20 minutes looking into something real instead of listening to the same propaganda from their friends on Twitter.
[03:03:35.072 --> 03:03:35.572]  Well, that's it.
[03:03:35.592 --> 03:03:42.315]  They try to segregate libertarians, conservatives, people ethnically, you name it, liberal, whatever, into little groups where you get fed your own echo chamber.
[03:03:42.595 --> 03:03:45.297]  We need to do raids into the brainwashed areas.
[03:03:46.497 --> 03:03:47.538]  Really great points, Luke.
[03:03:47.918 --> 03:03:48.698]  I appreciate your call.
[03:03:48.718 --> 03:03:53.960]  We're going to go to break, come back and play a few other clips, recap some things, and then move forward.
[03:03:53.980 --> 03:03:57.182]  But I have to tell you, Owen Troyer, I agree with you.
[03:03:59.400 --> 03:04:04.542]  We have to focus front and center on election fraud, on the fact that it's happening.
[03:04:05.162 --> 03:04:08.404]  But to say, listen, don't give up because the fraud's happening.
[03:04:08.464 --> 03:04:10.365]  The landslide is what opposes it.
[03:04:10.825 --> 03:04:15.907]  But the establishment is so evil that they're trying to block Trump and this populist movement.
[03:04:15.927 --> 03:04:16.887]  That's why you should be for Trump.
[03:04:17.208 --> 03:04:19.709]  The foreign communist Chinese, the Pope, the evil...
[03:04:20.859 --> 03:04:24.984]  Saudi Arabians, every criminal group is against him because they know his MO.
[03:04:25.284 --> 03:04:26.105]  He's his own person.
[03:04:26.145 --> 03:04:26.926]  He's a nationalist.
[03:04:27.186 --> 03:04:29.970]  And whether he's perfect or not, they've already hijacked the country.
[03:04:31.476 --> 03:04:34.498]  With this two-party dictatorship and the whole system's against him, we have to support him.
[03:04:34.798 --> 03:04:36.479]  So we've got 26 days, basically.
[03:04:36.499 --> 03:04:37.459]  27 is long in the tooth.
[03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:47.045]  We've got to decide how are we going to fight this, what are we going to do, how are we going to counter it, because we've got the head of elections in New York saying it's total fraud.
[03:04:47.485 --> 03:04:52.227]  This is our country and this is our right to vote for our next leader.
[03:04:52.247 --> 03:04:57.030]  I'm not going to let the fake lying media and the fake politicians steal this one from me.
[03:04:57.070 --> 03:04:58.291]  But you're an F-and-white male.
[03:04:58.491 --> 03:05:00.072]  We have to vote five times against you.
[03:05:00.693 --> 03:05:01.876]  I'll be a transvestite.
[03:05:01.936 --> 03:05:02.979]  Will you count my vote then?
[03:05:04.322 --> 03:05:04.623]  Maybe.
[03:05:04.824 --> 03:05:05.606]  Maybe that's what we do.
[03:05:05.626 --> 03:05:06.568]  We all change genders.
[03:05:06.588 --> 03:05:07.330]  Then they'll count our vote.
[03:05:09.158 --> 03:05:17.825]  Mr. Trump, you've got five things to say, ten things to say, and what you do, and by the way, whenever you go on any TV show, listen to me, I know what I'm talking about.
[03:05:17.845 --> 03:05:20.888]  You're going to say what you want to say, irrespective of what they ask you.
[03:05:20.908 --> 03:05:23.390]  And if they don't ask you, you say, you know, it's funny, that reminds me.
[03:05:23.410 --> 03:05:24.511]  And then you go right into it.
[03:05:24.531 --> 03:05:25.412]  Absolutely.
[03:05:25.672 --> 03:05:27.674]  He never even talked about immigration.
[03:05:28.174 --> 03:05:30.756]  The thing that brought him to the dance, he never even talked about.
[03:05:30.776 --> 03:05:35.020]  Number two, he's got to understand that he has a plan.
[03:05:36.321 --> 03:05:47.685]  Beat, soundly, Alex, 16 of the best and the brightest of the Republican Party, coming to senators, governors, including a brain surgeon, an actual brain surgeon.
[03:05:48.305 --> 03:05:50.245]  He didn't go out there slamming Hillary Clinton.
[03:05:50.545 --> 03:05:51.706]  He gave them a vision.
[03:05:51.806 --> 03:05:53.847]  And he talked about basically a couple of things.
[03:05:54.327 --> 03:05:58.088]  Illegal immigration and the sense of crime and losing.
[03:05:58.388 --> 03:06:01.409]  I would teach Donald Trump like a kata.
[03:06:02.089 --> 03:06:02.389]  I don't know.
[03:06:22.865 --> 03:06:32.316]  All you millennials, by the way, who were hosed by Bernie Sanders, who aren't necessarily going to vote for Hillary Clinton out of default, but who have been completely abandoned by this corrupt and venal system.
[03:06:32.677 --> 03:06:34.699]  I want to talk to you about this thing called whitewater.
[03:06:35.079 --> 03:06:38.864]  Once upon a time, there was something so big that the governor of Arkansas went to prison.
[03:06:39.164 --> 03:06:40.205]  That people were indicted.
[03:06:40.565 --> 03:06:48.568]  This makes you talk about Atlantic City, where the city went bankrupt, where we have casinos and Revel and Wynn and this.
[03:06:49.009 --> 03:06:52.510]  You're talking about, I have 400 corporations, five went bankrupt.
[03:06:52.710 --> 03:06:54.031]  Let's look at Mitt Romney's.
[03:06:54.251 --> 03:06:56.932]  Folks, bankruptcy is not the issue.
[03:06:57.012 --> 03:07:02.715]  Now, when she brings up Trump University, pray to God she brings it up.
[03:07:02.755 --> 03:07:04.516]  Say, I'm glad you brought that up.
[03:07:05.016 --> 03:07:07.357]  I want to talk about something called Laureate.
[03:07:07.717 --> 03:07:20.293]  When you talk about how he's fat-shaming a 90-whatever, some type of a beauty pageant contestant, I want to talk about sexual predation.
[03:07:21.437 --> 03:07:29.107]  Not Eleftherio, not somebody who's a skirt chaser, not somebody, but somebody who is a sexual predator.
[03:07:29.348 --> 03:07:35.015]  Now, remember, Bill Cosby, when people said, you know, that happened a long time ago.
[03:07:35.075 --> 03:07:35.596]  Who cares?
[03:07:35.876 --> 03:07:36.517]  It doesn't matter.
[03:07:36.817 --> 03:07:38.640]  Yeah, but you know, that was 40 years ago.
[03:07:38.760 --> 03:07:39.501]  It doesn't matter.
[03:07:39.921 --> 03:07:42.063]  Nobody blamed Bill Cosby's wife.
[03:07:42.483 --> 03:07:46.947]  They're looking at Hillary as the innocent spouse.
[03:07:47.307 --> 03:07:59.057]  When you are the Secretary of State and you can't say, give me the money, pay me the money and I'll give you most favored nation status or arms or whatever, you can't do that.
[03:07:59.577 --> 03:08:05.302]  What she did was, I'll tell you what, pay the Clinton Foundation.
[03:08:06.003 --> 03:08:07.344]  That's the connection.
[03:08:07.884 --> 03:08:08.705]  That's the nexus.
[03:08:17.612 --> 03:08:20.513]  It's Tuesday, October 11th, 2016.
[03:08:21.573 --> 03:08:28.256]  We are now only 27 short days out from the most important election in modern history.
[03:08:28.876 --> 03:08:34.018]  An election that may decide the fate, not just of our republic, but the world.
[03:08:36.198 --> 03:08:37.879]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:39.319 --> 03:08:40.660]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[03:08:41.901 --> 03:08:43.262]  Owen Schroeder's riding shotgun with me.
[03:08:43.302 --> 03:08:45.343]  We've got about 10-15 minutes.
[03:08:45.383 --> 03:08:48.985]  We've got Rob Dewey coming in from the other studio with a whole bunch of breaking news and information.
[03:08:50.546 --> 03:08:58.550]  Speaking of breaking news and information, there are thousands of emails being gone through with the third data dump of the week by WikiLeaks and it's now pay dirt.
[03:08:59.790 --> 03:09:04.813]  It's Hillary getting money from foreign governments, pay-per-play, espionage.
[03:09:06.311 --> 03:09:12.476]  Knowing Stuff's classified, Chelsea freaking out saying, uh, they want us to settle a nine billion dollar lawsuit.
[03:09:12.496 --> 03:09:14.398]  They just paid us money and they're ordering me around.
[03:09:14.598 --> 03:09:15.359]  We're gonna get in trouble.
[03:09:15.539 --> 03:09:16.240]  This is illegal.
[03:09:17.241 --> 03:09:18.482]  It's all there.
[03:09:21.800 --> 03:09:25.762]  To quote Tulsa Doom, they'll all drown in lakes of blood.
[03:09:25.782 --> 03:09:28.443]  Instead, they'll all drown in lakes of WikiLeak.
[03:09:29.124 --> 03:09:33.106]  Hillary Clinton bragged about being invited to Putin's inner sanctum.
[03:09:33.466 --> 03:09:36.007]  Breitbart.com going up on Infowars.com.
[03:09:37.468 --> 03:09:39.829]  The big clearinghouse for all of this is DrudgeReport.com right now.
[03:09:40.189 --> 03:09:42.010]  Shortly after being revealed,
[03:09:43.168 --> 03:09:44.348]  We're relieved of her duties.
[03:09:45.008 --> 03:10:07.594]  As Secretary of State, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton reportedly gave a series of speeches in which she described Russian President Vladimir Putin as a very interesting conversationalist, who she said had gotten to know, including a visit to her or his private inner sanctum, to discuss wildlife conservation.
[03:10:07.674 --> 03:10:09.094]  So let's go over this.
[03:10:10.715 --> 03:10:12.115]  Right before she was sworn in as Secretary of State,
[03:10:13.456 --> 03:10:29.807]  The presidential nominee Hillary Clinton reportedly gave a series of speeches in which she described Russian President Vladimir Putin as a very interesting conversationalist who she had gotten to know, including a visit, did she vomit green balls on him, to his private inner sanctum.
[03:10:32.049 --> 03:10:40.375]  I don't think Putin wants to be around her private sanctum, or I don't think there'll be any grabbing from Trumpists, to discuss wildlife conservation.
[03:10:40.815 --> 03:10:41.856]  Clinton, who
[03:10:43.663 --> 03:10:47.484]  You know, you got Santa, you got Krumpus, the bad Santa, and you got Trumpus.
[03:10:47.564 --> 03:10:48.705]  It's a good, super good Santa.
[03:10:48.725 --> 03:10:49.585]  Trumpus, the good Santa?
[03:10:49.625 --> 03:10:50.405]  Trumpus, dude.
[03:10:50.785 --> 03:10:54.326]  If Trumpus comes, you can get really good stuff, like your taxes cut in half.
[03:10:55.207 --> 03:10:56.627]  I'd love to be visited by Trumpus.
[03:10:56.907 --> 03:10:58.508]  Trumpus is checking Hillary's list twice.
[03:10:58.528 --> 03:10:59.588]  Have you been a good patriot?
[03:10:59.648 --> 03:11:01.188]  He's checking the WikiLeaks twice.
[03:11:01.289 --> 03:11:02.849]  I'm gonna lock your ass up, lady.
[03:11:02.869 --> 03:11:04.229]  They're like, it's fascism!
[03:11:04.429 --> 03:11:05.290]  Not if she's a criminal!
[03:11:06.190 --> 03:11:07.010]  Oh, here's Hillary.
[03:11:07.370 --> 03:11:09.291]  Putin's bad, Putin's bad, Putin's bad!
[03:11:09.311 --> 03:11:09.951]  Hillary's emails.
[03:11:10.151 --> 03:11:11.492]  Ah, I was in with Putin.
[03:11:11.512 --> 03:11:11.952]  I'm good.
[03:11:12.677 --> 03:11:17.181]  Meanwhile, she got 35 mil, and her chief of staff did, to give him one-fifth our uranium.
[03:11:18.322 --> 03:11:20.323]  The Russians are trying to advance their aims.
[03:11:20.343 --> 03:11:22.305]  They're certainly involved in stuff.
[03:11:22.725 --> 03:11:23.686]  The thing is, it's with her.
[03:11:23.706 --> 03:11:24.507]  That's what I mean.
[03:11:24.567 --> 03:11:26.669]  Our husbands are raping people, settling cases.
[03:11:26.889 --> 03:11:27.790]  They're accusing Trump of it.
[03:11:27.830 --> 03:11:33.194]  It's like everything they say, like, Trump has evil magics, the New Democrat Party statement.
[03:11:33.574 --> 03:11:34.535]  No, you are evil.
[03:11:34.996 --> 03:11:35.476]  How about this?
[03:11:35.616 --> 03:11:40.880]  Outside of the realm of truth, let's just look at these stories for what they are in existence.
[03:11:41.701 --> 03:11:43.882]  They don't cover the bad Hillary stories.
[03:11:44.502 --> 03:11:44.842]  Never.
[03:11:45.002 --> 03:11:46.342]  That are 50 times worse!
[03:11:46.362 --> 03:11:49.023]  People are like, but Alex, Trump really talked about... And she's been in government!
[03:11:49.183 --> 03:11:50.704]  You know, women are jumping on me.
[03:11:50.764 --> 03:11:51.564]  You can just grab them.
[03:11:51.584 --> 03:11:51.984]  They love it.
[03:11:52.004 --> 03:11:52.344]  Yeah.
[03:11:53.084 --> 03:11:53.844]  Yeah, ask Tiger Woods.
[03:11:53.864 --> 03:11:55.765]  Yeah, when a woman's jumping on you, that's the whole point.
[03:11:56.985 --> 03:11:58.086]  Ask Tiger Woods about that.
[03:11:58.126 --> 03:11:58.866]  He's had a little experience.
[03:11:58.886 --> 03:12:01.226]  It's not sexual assault if they're throwing themselves at you.
[03:12:01.607 --> 03:12:02.427]  And again, look.
[03:12:02.647 --> 03:12:04.627]  Once cheeks turn red, they grab you.
[03:12:04.907 --> 03:12:05.828]  That means get to work.
[03:12:06.028 --> 03:12:08.408]  I don't have to defend... I mean, you know, if you're a mammal.
[03:12:08.628 --> 03:12:09.809]  You know, God made us this way.
[03:12:09.909 --> 03:12:10.169]  I'm not...
[03:12:11.237 --> 03:12:13.919]  They've got all the fake Christians thinking sex is the only bad thing out there.
[03:12:13.939 --> 03:12:14.359]  And you know what?
[03:12:14.399 --> 03:12:14.680]  It's weird too.
[03:12:14.700 --> 03:12:16.961]  If they'd stand up for some unborn babies, I'd be happy.
[03:12:17.122 --> 03:12:19.403]  Here's something that I just realized having this conversation with you.
[03:12:19.784 --> 03:12:24.127]  Fake Christians, once you get the abortion ban, you can start talking about sex being evil all day.
[03:12:24.147 --> 03:12:24.768]  And I get it.
[03:12:25.268 --> 03:12:26.089]  Sex is important.
[03:12:26.129 --> 03:12:28.831]  You need to stay with your family and kids and it's all good.
[03:12:28.851 --> 03:12:31.873]  But that's all you harp on because you know everybody's having sex.
[03:12:31.893 --> 03:12:34.475]  You want to make us all feel guilty like a bunch of Pharisees.
[03:12:35.156 --> 03:12:37.878]  Where's Christ when you need him with a bullwhip to beat you upside the head?
[03:12:38.038 --> 03:12:48.186]  They tell us these stories that we evolved from primates, that we're, you know, primal animals, essentially, but then they want us to reject all of our primal animal instincts and demonize us for having them!
[03:12:48.566 --> 03:12:49.847]  You can't have it both ways!
[03:12:49.907 --> 03:12:57.413]  No, in the words of Up and Smoked, when they get the pizza at the end, and, you know, General Stadinkus or Lieutenant Stinkus goes, Go with it!
[03:12:57.713 --> 03:12:58.234]  Ah, the pizza!
[03:12:58.274 --> 03:12:59.895]  Can we get that video, please?
[03:13:00.395 --> 03:13:02.217]  The end of Up and Smoked, when they eat the pizza, can we just go,
[03:13:03.312 --> 03:13:06.754]  Uh oh, Alex, I've been told I gotta try to keep you on the rails here in the fourth hour.
[03:13:06.774 --> 03:13:09.095]  Alright, you're thinking about up in smoke now, alright?
[03:13:09.115 --> 03:13:10.956]  But this isn't the Hillary campaign up in smoke.
[03:13:11.596 --> 03:13:12.256]  That's what it should be.
[03:13:12.296 --> 03:13:13.357]  I don't smoke marijuana.
[03:13:13.957 --> 03:13:16.458]  But I like Stacey Keach, and that's a funny part of the movie.
[03:13:17.359 --> 03:13:20.560]  Didn't, uh... Because the van's on fire and all the pot's getting the cops high.
[03:13:20.820 --> 03:13:23.022]  You know that, uh... And then all this pizza and the cops go crazy.
[03:13:23.122 --> 03:13:27.784]  Is that the one when they're in the back of the van and it keeps moving up and down and everyone's like, what is going on?
[03:13:27.864 --> 03:13:28.944]  And then the woman walks out.
[03:13:29.004 --> 03:13:31.506]  That's probably what Trump's, uh, Trump's tour van looks like.
[03:13:31.526 --> 03:13:32.206]  No, no, no.
[03:13:34.028 --> 03:13:36.209]  No, it's a family show, be serious.
[03:13:36.229 --> 03:13:37.009]  No, no, no, here it is.
[03:13:37.489 --> 03:13:48.052]  Hey, jihadis killing 200,000 Christians and cutting women's genitals off and selling five-year-olds into sex slavery and 100 jihadis raping a six-year-old until she dies, that's not an issue.
[03:13:48.872 --> 03:13:50.953]  Us making jokes, that is, so stop it right now.
[03:13:51.473 --> 03:13:57.675]  And, you know, Donald Trump talking with his, whether Billy Bush is his friend or not, I don't know, but having a locker room cover.
[03:13:57.895 --> 03:13:58.755]  Did you see the new one?
[03:13:59.415 --> 03:14:01.257]  Oh, I've talked to athletes.
[03:14:01.317 --> 03:14:02.638]  That's not how they talk in the locker room.
[03:14:02.859 --> 03:14:04.760]  Actually, I've worked in professional media.
[03:14:04.881 --> 03:14:09.065]  I can personally tell you that yes, athletes do talk like that in the locker room.
[03:14:09.085 --> 03:14:10.286]  Let me tell you what goes on in the football locker room.
[03:14:11.391 --> 03:14:11.971]  You don't want to know.
[03:14:12.891 --> 03:14:20.234]  I mean there's so much cussing and sex talk and all this stuff that it's a crescendo of noise and all you want to do is get in the showers and get the hell out of there.
[03:14:20.614 --> 03:14:21.014]  It's true.
[03:14:21.394 --> 03:14:21.874]  Hey guys.
[03:14:22.215 --> 03:14:23.155]  Especially as a media member.
[03:14:23.175 --> 03:14:32.158]  One of the things that I thought was really interesting about it is that you know the left has been like the champion of open sexuality and you know
[03:14:33.238 --> 03:14:41.984]  Liberal views towards sexuality, and then now they're the ones coming back and saying, oh no, did you hear what Donald Trump said about women?
[03:14:42.324 --> 03:14:45.106]  Oh, it's like the new Victorian age, but it's double think.
[03:14:45.186 --> 03:14:51.610]  They can do whatever they want, teach your five-year-old how to do horrible stuff, but then if you're an adult, go ahead.
[03:14:51.630 --> 03:14:53.711]  They're like secretly recording and editing tape.
[03:14:53.731 --> 03:14:56.833]  Gore Vidal, the stuff that Gore Vidal was putting out?
[03:14:58.188 --> 03:15:02.331]  Oh, he put movies out where trannies are raping people and sexually liberated.
[03:15:02.351 --> 03:15:04.613]  They're allowed to rape everyone and it's loving.
[03:15:06.855 --> 03:15:08.776]  And Gore Vidal's been on the show and wrote some good stuff, too.
[03:15:08.836 --> 03:15:15.662]  And I mean, I'm not attacking him on every front, but he wrote some stuff that I read, which is like he's advocating a tranny running around raping people.
[03:15:16.142 --> 03:15:16.743]  That's not right.
[03:15:17.363 --> 03:15:19.605]  But because it's liberating for the tranny, it's OK.
[03:15:20.446 --> 03:15:20.606]  Right?
[03:15:21.226 --> 03:15:24.289]  Well, yeah, I mean, that's that's the whole point is the double thing, like you just said.
[03:15:25.274 --> 03:15:30.659]  I can do it, I can do it, but then, oh, I preach tolerance until you have a differing view.
[03:15:31.039 --> 03:15:32.100]  Now I'm not tolerant.
[03:15:32.140 --> 03:15:34.882]  I'm tolerant of everything and everyone and anyone and everything's great.
[03:15:35.022 --> 03:15:35.943]  But I can judge you.
[03:15:35.963 --> 03:15:37.724]  Oh my God, wait, wait, you're disagreeing with me?
[03:15:38.325 --> 03:15:39.406]  Shut him down!
[03:15:39.486 --> 03:15:40.146]  He's a racist!
[03:15:40.186 --> 03:15:43.389]  Again, if you just joined us, banish the untold story of Danny Williams.
[03:15:43.409 --> 03:15:47.212]  Search for his father, exclusive, Infowars.com, Danny tries to reconnect.
[03:15:48.573 --> 03:15:49.814]  With reported father Bill Clinton.
[03:15:49.854 --> 03:15:50.414]  That's my headline.
[03:15:50.434 --> 03:15:50.994]  I did it with Kit.
[03:15:51.074 --> 03:15:51.674]  Kit is awesome.
[03:15:51.694 --> 03:15:52.495]  I'm gonna change it though.
[03:15:53.075 --> 03:15:54.256]  His drudge has got it right.
[03:15:55.556 --> 03:16:05.601]  Bill Clinton's son, in quotes, the son part in quotes, Bill Clinton's son asked for DNA test from Bill Clinton.
[03:16:06.567 --> 03:16:07.207]  That's basically it.
[03:16:07.508 --> 03:16:08.208]  Do the test, Bill.
[03:16:08.288 --> 03:16:08.748]  Why wouldn't you?
[03:16:08.788 --> 03:16:09.729]  Hey Alex, one other thing.
[03:16:10.049 --> 03:16:11.990]  Bernie Sanders used to write smut as well.
[03:16:12.030 --> 03:16:13.111]  Nobody ever brought that up.
[03:16:13.231 --> 03:16:14.051]  That was not a big deal.
[03:16:14.292 --> 03:16:15.272]  Well, I mean, listen.
[03:16:15.412 --> 03:16:21.095]  Obama's real father, the reason they did the whole Kenya thing and his Harvard review and every other publication said, I'm from Kenya, I'm from Kenya.
[03:16:21.316 --> 03:16:22.837]  We're like, you say you're from Kenya, stop lying!
[03:16:23.917 --> 03:16:26.578]  That was all to hide the fact his father was Frank Marshall Davis!
[03:16:26.858 --> 03:16:31.160]  And then he writes in his dreams of my father, I spent summers with Frank Marshall Davis!
[03:16:31.420 --> 03:16:32.781]  My grandfather's best friend!
[03:16:33.001 --> 03:16:34.081]  Cause it's your daddy!
[03:16:34.141 --> 03:16:35.842]  He looks exactly like Frank Marshall Davis.
[03:16:35.962 --> 03:16:39.083]  Who was a communist funding himself with porn!
[03:16:39.963 --> 03:16:40.984]  And I don't mean softcore.
[03:16:41.983 --> 03:16:45.706]  I mean, Batty Page stuff had pretty good taste.
[03:16:45.766 --> 03:16:46.347]  Here's another thing.
[03:16:46.387 --> 03:16:49.269]  They've got these kids so brainwashed and mind-controlled.
[03:16:50.110 --> 03:16:55.755]  Yesterday, when Owen was interviewing people, or the day before, the guy said, Trump said he liked kissing pretty girls.
[03:16:56.295 --> 03:16:57.056]  Oh my God!
[03:16:58.317 --> 03:16:59.098]  It's like, really?
[03:16:59.319 --> 03:16:59.980]  The humans!
[03:17:00.200 --> 03:17:01.702]  The humans are together!
[03:17:01.742 --> 03:17:03.024]  The humans love each other!
[03:17:03.184 --> 03:17:04.146]  They want to have babies!
[03:17:04.186 --> 03:17:04.987]  Are these like aliens?
[03:17:05.167 --> 03:17:06.649]  We must reduce their population!
[03:17:06.889 --> 03:17:08.111]  Teach them that this is bad!
[03:17:08.452 --> 03:17:09.593]  The Slore Lord!
[03:17:09.874 --> 03:17:11.176]  We have them not producing!
[03:17:11.196 --> 03:17:12.598]  Good job, Glomular!
[03:17:14.162 --> 03:17:16.843]  Yeah, totally ridiculous, but that's what they've done to our culture.
[03:17:16.884 --> 03:17:18.004]  They've been ingrained.
[03:17:18.344 --> 03:17:23.427]  That's why these young kids, there is no racism, because they've, you know, literally beat it out of them.
[03:17:23.747 --> 03:17:24.588]  There is no anything.
[03:17:24.928 --> 03:17:27.029]  There is, follow what the state says.
[03:17:27.049 --> 03:17:27.969]  Yeah, where's the article?
[03:17:27.989 --> 03:17:28.770]  I asked for it again.
[03:17:28.810 --> 03:17:31.311]  It's wrong, and everything is racist except what we say.
[03:17:31.331 --> 03:17:32.252]  I agree, dude.
[03:17:32.792 --> 03:17:33.412]  We're going back to you.
[03:17:33.432 --> 03:17:34.813]  Just been out to play two clips, and I'm out of here.
[03:17:35.273 --> 03:17:36.414]  But let me show you this article.
[03:17:36.514 --> 03:17:37.875]  One of the WikiLeaks, InfoWars.com.
[03:17:39.011 --> 03:17:45.975]  Clinton campaign email outlines effort to, quote, produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[03:17:46.995 --> 03:17:48.136]  Now, I just quoted this.
[03:17:48.996 --> 03:17:53.178]  Clinton email outlines effort to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[03:17:53.418 --> 03:17:54.479]  Here, let me read this to you.
[03:17:56.320 --> 03:18:04.404]  A Clinton campaign email released a part of WikiLeaks down and up earlier today that talks about a need to maintain political power by producing a, quote, unaware and compliant citizenry.
[03:18:04.744 --> 03:18:05.764]  But the quote gets better.
[03:18:05.944 --> 03:18:06.645]  Get ready for this.
[03:18:08.257 --> 03:18:10.999]  Because this sounds like something an alien would say.
[03:18:11.619 --> 03:18:13.581]  Say it in an NPR voice so it's okay.
[03:18:13.601 --> 03:18:14.561]  You are overpopulated.
[03:18:14.681 --> 03:18:15.502]  You are no longer reading.
[03:18:15.822 --> 03:18:16.463]  Okay, sure.
[03:18:16.923 --> 03:18:17.343]  Calm.
[03:18:17.764 --> 03:18:25.609]  The email was sent to Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, by former Clinton administration official, Bill Ivey, on March 13, 2016.
[03:18:25.769 --> 03:18:28.871]  Trust us, love us, sleep.
[03:18:29.572 --> 03:18:30.973]  Sleepy time.
[03:18:32.174 --> 03:18:33.414]  Free doctors.
[03:18:33.855 --> 03:18:34.975]  We're liberal.
[03:18:34.995 --> 03:18:35.136]  Sorry.
[03:18:36.554 --> 03:18:40.978]  Ivy was appointed chairman of the National Endowment of the Arts during Bill Clinton's second term.
[03:18:41.358 --> 03:18:50.185]  According to his bio, Ivy is a trustee of the Center for American Progress, a Clinton campaign front, and was a team leader in Barack Obama's presidential transition.
[03:18:50.846 --> 03:18:59.893]  In the email, Ivy outlines a panic among some Democrats that Donald Trump's quote celebrity politics persona cannot be matched by Hillary who has quote
[03:19:00.473 --> 03:19:04.134]  Not an entertainer, and not a celebrity, in the Trump-Kardashian mold, close quote.
[03:19:04.634 --> 03:19:14.858]  Continuing to quote from that email, in the latest WikiLeaks Datatom, I'm liberal, see I talk like this, it means I'm intellectual, uh, uh, uh, not reading talking points, money isn't, we can go back, sorry.
[03:19:15.638 --> 03:19:17.479]  Let me just be real condescending and I'm a total genius.
[03:19:17.499 --> 03:19:19.540]  I'm a little IQ but I act like I'm smart.
[03:19:20.060 --> 03:19:20.841]  I'm channeling these people.
[03:19:21.141 --> 03:19:21.781]  I'm channeling them.
[03:19:21.821 --> 03:19:22.361]  I'm a parasite.
[03:19:22.381 --> 03:19:24.562]  I'm channeling them.
[03:19:25.143 --> 03:19:31.646]  Money isn't all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the election process.
[03:19:32.506 --> 03:19:33.947]  So they admit he's hijacking it.
[03:19:34.387 --> 03:19:36.508]  Trump masters TV.
[03:19:37.028 --> 03:19:48.892]  TV called News picks up the repeats and repeats to the death, skip the break guys, to the optimized blowhard and his harebrained ideas.
[03:19:49.432 --> 03:19:55.795]  Free-floating discontent attaches to the seeming strongman and we're off and running, complains Ivy.
[03:19:56.155 --> 03:19:57.096]  He's got the psychology.
[03:19:57.116 --> 03:20:05.983]  We're looking for somebody to take the government back, follow the Constitution, take the handcuffs off, don't let China or everybody else have double-sided deals with these little slimers that get it.
[03:20:06.203 --> 03:20:10.867]  Notice, everything you're hearing from them is what I tell you word for word every day, but from the perspective of liberty.
[03:20:11.507 --> 03:20:12.588]  I'm telling you how they work.
[03:20:12.628 --> 03:20:13.429]  Let me get back in the mode.
[03:20:13.449 --> 03:20:14.370]  It's hard to talk like these people.
[03:20:19.247 --> 03:20:23.631]  Well, behind the scenes they just hobble, they go, I'm gonna get you, I'll murder you, I'm in control, bleh!
[03:20:23.771 --> 03:20:32.238]  And they go, oh, liberal, non-threatening, it's all their camo, I'm wearing different colored socks, and I'm wearing a... I'm wearing a Hindi... necklace.
[03:20:35.961 --> 03:20:38.163]  Now you are under our control, excuse me.
[03:20:38.463 --> 03:20:39.524]  Oh, let me get back into character.
[03:20:39.745 --> 03:20:44.729]  I'm a fake liberal, I'm a fake... Peace, brothers, hold on.
[03:20:46.488 --> 03:20:57.998]  And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics, and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[03:20:59.939 --> 03:21:05.304]  The higher caste leader says... Now here's the most important part.
[03:21:06.284 --> 03:21:08.186]  The unawareness remains strong.
[03:21:09.587 --> 03:21:10.588]  Oh, thank God you heard that.
[03:21:11.148 --> 03:21:13.030]  The unawareness remains strong.
[03:21:13.090 --> 03:21:13.991]  Keep them in sleep.
[03:21:14.771 --> 03:21:15.072]  Sleep.
[03:21:17.779 --> 03:21:24.468]  The unawareness remains strong, but compliance is obviously fading rapidly.
[03:21:24.488 --> 03:21:34.281]  They're unaware, but their animal instinct, their gut, their spirit, their subconscious knows, and it's not complying.
[03:21:36.826 --> 03:21:41.248]  The unawareness remains strong, but compliance is obviously fading rapidly.
[03:21:42.108 --> 03:21:46.750]  This problem demands some serious, serious thinking.
[03:21:47.250 --> 03:21:51.412]  And not just poll-driven, demographically-inspired messaging.
[03:21:52.032 --> 03:21:52.652]  Race war.
[03:21:52.973 --> 03:21:58.395]  So I guess that's them admitting that they rigged the polls to try to provide fake optics to try to help rig this thing.
[03:21:58.635 --> 03:22:00.296]  They don't rig it!
[03:22:00.316 --> 03:22:02.456]  Don't speak with that scratchy voice, provincial!
[03:22:05.012 --> 03:22:06.559]  Oh, I'm sure... What, is that racist?
[03:22:06.600 --> 03:22:06.800]  What?
[03:22:07.102 --> 03:22:08.589]  I don't know if anyone... Just racist!
[03:22:09.369 --> 03:22:09.729]  I'm done.
[03:22:09.769 --> 03:22:12.370]  I've been trumped by your comment calling me a racist.
[03:22:12.430 --> 03:22:13.470]  But that's what they actually do.
[03:22:13.490 --> 03:22:13.910]  Racist!
[03:22:15.231 --> 03:22:16.111]  Racist, racist!
[03:22:16.331 --> 03:22:19.612]  How do you deal with such intellectual strategy, folks?
[03:22:20.432 --> 03:22:21.432]  People say this all the time.
[03:22:21.452 --> 03:22:23.493]  We want Owen on the streets doing this more often.
[03:22:23.513 --> 03:22:24.673]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:22:24.713 --> 03:22:27.254]  I didn't want to execute them, felt I owed it to them.
[03:22:27.494 --> 03:22:28.974]  Buy the products, okay?
[03:22:29.014 --> 03:22:30.815]  That's how you send me these events, Alex.
[03:22:30.975 --> 03:22:32.795]  Oh yeah, let's play the event tape.
[03:22:32.855 --> 03:22:33.755]  We gotta go quick.
[03:22:35.916 --> 03:22:36.596]  No, no, no.
[03:22:36.956 --> 03:22:39.797]  Well, basically, so, you know, these are the people that we deal with.
[03:22:39.817 --> 03:22:40.878]  We've exposed these people.
[03:22:41.398 --> 03:22:43.618]  I don't know how many videos I have exposing these people.
[03:22:44.059 --> 03:22:50.201]  It shows the difference, the dynamic difference between how informed a Trump voter is versus a Hillary voter.
[03:22:51.001 --> 03:22:51.281]  Go ahead.
[03:22:53.952 --> 03:22:55.733]  Sexual assault that he admitted to!
[03:22:55.773 --> 03:22:59.095]  He lost a billion dollars in one year!
[03:22:59.135 --> 03:22:59.935]  He's a moron!
[03:22:59.995 --> 03:23:00.916]  So does Steve Jobs!
[03:23:00.956 --> 03:23:06.078]  So you want a rapist in the White House?
[03:23:06.098 --> 03:23:06.218]  Yes!
[03:23:06.238 --> 03:23:08.780]  Oh, he wants a rapist in the White House!
[03:23:08.820 --> 03:23:09.720]  He's a rapist!
[03:23:09.760 --> 03:23:10.821]  Who has Donald Trump raped?
[03:23:10.861 --> 03:23:15.323]  He's saying that, oh it's okay that I can touch a woman because I'm- Who has Donald Trump raped?
[03:23:15.443 --> 03:23:16.343]  Name one woman!
[03:23:16.363 --> 03:23:17.384]  Name one woman!
[03:23:19.805 --> 03:23:21.066]  Donald Trump is a moron.
[03:23:21.446 --> 03:23:22.407]  Donald Trump's a moron.
[03:23:22.447 --> 03:23:24.148]  This guy's made billions of dollars.
[03:23:24.408 --> 03:23:26.289]  One of the most successful businessmen in the world.
[03:23:26.369 --> 03:23:28.450]  His daddy gave him all his money!
[03:23:28.510 --> 03:23:29.751]  His daddy gave him everything!
[03:23:29.791 --> 03:23:31.852]  If you got $1 million dollars and- 14!
[03:23:32.812 --> 03:23:31.852]  14!
[03:23:32.872 --> 03:23:38.375]  But, if you got $100 million dollars and turned it into $6 billion, would that be a success?
[03:23:38.535 --> 03:23:38.755]  No!
[03:23:38.836 --> 03:23:41.557]  Because I can do better in an index fund!
[03:23:41.597 --> 03:23:43.198]  No, that's not a success!
[03:23:43.238 --> 03:23:44.859]  Turning millions into billions!
[03:23:45.683 --> 03:23:50.868]  Hillary created the derivatives with Larry Summers and Clinton that has 2.2 quadrillion.
[03:23:50.888 --> 03:23:54.411]  A hundred times all the wealth in the world were totally screwed.
[03:23:54.591 --> 03:23:55.592]  They never had a real job in their life.
[03:23:56.753 --> 03:24:04.420]  But suddenly they don't like it because you have some ventures, like I've done films that did not make money, only a few, but each one has a corporation.
[03:24:05.444 --> 03:24:07.925]  I don't declare bankruptcy, but it's a write-off towards everything else.
[03:24:07.945 --> 03:24:08.685]  That's what you do.
[03:24:08.705 --> 03:24:10.226]  A new hotel, a new golf course, a new venture?
[03:24:10.746 --> 03:24:12.327]  He's had four or five bankruptcies.
[03:24:12.667 --> 03:24:13.407]  That's normal.
[03:24:14.168 --> 03:24:16.308]  Warren Buffett's had thousands with his subsidiaries.
[03:24:16.368 --> 03:24:17.809]  And he's been bailed out by the government.
[03:24:18.409 --> 03:24:20.230]  Four hundred and something billion in the bailout, yeah.
[03:24:20.690 --> 03:24:20.990]  I know.
[03:24:21.711 --> 03:24:22.211]  Go back to it.
[03:24:24.339 --> 03:24:25.940]  Have you seen a Hillary Clinton rally?
[03:24:25.980 --> 03:24:26.460]  No, I haven't.
[03:24:26.500 --> 03:24:27.600]  Exactly, because nobody goes.
[03:24:27.620 --> 03:24:29.021]  Why don't you like Trump?
[03:24:45.407 --> 03:24:47.189]  Because he's a turd!
[03:24:47.669 --> 03:24:49.310]  This guy just blew my mind with his intellect.
[03:24:49.330 --> 03:24:50.932]  You like Jill Stein?
[03:24:51.092 --> 03:24:52.633]  Do you think she has a chance?
[03:24:53.074 --> 03:24:55.175]  She's got no chance, but it's okay.
[03:24:55.376 --> 03:24:56.196]  Hey, you know what?
[03:24:56.497 --> 03:24:58.078]  Hey, at least you're not supporting Hillary.
[03:24:58.158 --> 03:24:59.139]  I've never really understood that.
[03:24:59.159 --> 03:24:59.899]  Could you explain that to me?
[03:25:02.402 --> 03:25:05.825]  I think it's just that I'm not well spoken.
[03:25:07.985 --> 03:25:09.606]  Um, someone just gave it to me.
[03:25:09.646 --> 03:25:10.607]  I've been carrying it around.
[03:25:10.927 --> 03:25:13.008]  I don't really... Oh, you don't really care much about the sign?
[03:25:13.028 --> 03:25:16.370]  Yeah, I'm just here to get free stuff, so... So, did you like Bernie Sanders?
[03:25:16.670 --> 03:25:17.090]  Yes, I did.
[03:25:17.631 --> 03:25:19.392]  Hillary supports love and Trump does not.
[03:25:19.512 --> 03:25:20.112]  Yeah, there you go.
[03:25:20.552 --> 03:25:21.573]  Because Trump's racist.
[03:25:22.013 --> 03:25:23.034]  What has he done that's racist?
[03:25:23.634 --> 03:25:24.295]  Just everything.
[03:25:24.335 --> 03:25:26.056]  Like, everything that comes out of his mouth.
[03:25:26.276 --> 03:25:36.822]  Well, not hiring, but some of the comments that he makes regarding, like, different genders and different, like, races and just, like, anyone who he doesn't consider a true American, which he defines the white male as, like... When did he do that?
[03:25:38.353 --> 03:25:39.415]  I don't want to talk to you anymore.
[03:25:39.635 --> 03:25:45.447]  Well, I feel like Donald Trump does a lot of things that could be construed as evil.
[03:25:46.008 --> 03:25:46.529]  Can you name one?
[03:25:47.741 --> 03:25:49.202]  Uh, how about the video that was just released?
[03:25:49.623 --> 03:25:50.683]  How can you support Trump?
[03:25:50.803 --> 03:25:52.545]  I just don't... Because I want to save America, personally.
[03:25:52.625 --> 03:25:54.026]  Do you want a rapist in the White House?
[03:25:54.126 --> 03:25:54.846]  Hillary is running for president.
[03:25:54.886 --> 03:25:55.967]  Do you want a rapist in the White House?
[03:25:55.987 --> 03:25:56.848]  Hillary is running for president.
[03:25:56.888 --> 03:25:58.229]  So is Bill not going to go to the White House, then?
[03:25:58.349 --> 03:26:00.590]  Bill will be in the White House, but Hillary... So do you want a rapist in the White House?
[03:26:00.951 --> 03:26:02.972]  Donald Trump would be in the White House if he won.
[03:26:02.992 --> 03:26:04.813]  Do you want a rapist in the White House?
[03:26:04.833 --> 03:26:05.834]  Hillary is running for president.
[03:26:05.854 --> 03:26:06.855]  You're not answering the question.
[03:26:06.895 --> 03:26:08.076]  Do you want a rapist in the White House?
[03:26:08.536 --> 03:26:09.357]  Bill is not a rapist.
[03:26:09.618 --> 03:26:11.060]  Do you want a rapist in the White House?
[03:26:11.320 --> 03:26:12.381]  Hillary is running for president.
[03:26:12.802 --> 03:26:14.324]  Won't answer the question.
[03:26:14.364 --> 03:26:15.746]  You made it an issue about women.
[03:26:15.966 --> 03:26:17.128]  You made it an issue about women.
[03:26:17.288 --> 03:26:21.154]  So if you're going to call out Trump's rhetoric against women, why don't you call out Bill's actual rape?
[03:26:21.194 --> 03:26:22.816]  Because Bill has nothing to do with this election.
[03:26:22.836 --> 03:26:23.457]  This is settled.
[03:26:23.677 --> 03:26:23.937]  No people.
[03:26:46.108 --> 03:26:50.671]  Email leaks have shown how Hillary Clinton has called her own supporters dumbasses.
[03:26:51.251 --> 03:26:55.374]  Donald Trump said that Mexicans are rapists and murderers.
[03:26:55.394 --> 03:26:55.954]  Never said that.
[03:26:56.394 --> 03:26:56.955]  Never said that.
[03:26:56.995 --> 03:26:58.736]  He said illegal immigrants, sir.
[03:26:59.056 --> 03:27:02.538]  No, we shouldn't.
[03:27:02.718 --> 03:27:04.159]  Well, that's your logic.
[03:27:04.199 --> 03:27:06.380]  Donald Trump is saying that all Mexicans are rapists and murderers.
[03:27:06.520 --> 03:27:07.161]  Never said that!
[03:27:08.720 --> 03:27:09.821]  Alright, that's powerful.
[03:27:10.742 --> 03:27:23.331]  Obviously, folks, these people, and I'm not being mean to them, but they all look very weak, very pale, like total followers, and then they keep on the news like he was looming behind Hillary.
[03:27:23.671 --> 03:27:25.352]  He may have attacked her, experts say.
[03:27:25.372 --> 03:27:27.354]  You were making a joke, I was eating real quick during a break.
[03:27:27.394 --> 03:27:28.254]  You go, that's aggressive.
[03:27:28.554 --> 03:27:30.156]  You're triggering me eating that food real fast.
[03:27:31.024 --> 03:27:31.564]  Like a wolf.
[03:27:31.904 --> 03:27:32.405]  Like a wolf.
[03:27:32.425 --> 03:27:33.265]  Well, I gotta eat here.
[03:27:33.325 --> 03:27:34.805]  I haven't eaten since like 6, 8, 7 a.m.
[03:27:35.146 --> 03:27:41.788]  So all this is going on, and it's literally like they're just these little, uh, uh, uh, Hillary, I love you.
[03:27:42.108 --> 03:27:46.270]  This country is literally producing piles of jellyfish.
[03:27:46.390 --> 03:27:48.010]  I mean, I'm sorry, folks, we're done.
[03:27:48.531 --> 03:27:56.714]  And those of us that produce and are not jellyfish, we've got to break away from these people and just stop submitting to them and them trying to henpeck us how to talk and what to do.
[03:27:56.774 --> 03:28:00.115]  I want to show some video here, going out to break, you know, a final comment.
[03:28:00.495 --> 03:28:03.296]  Several of those women slept with him knowing he was a married man.
[03:28:33.963 --> 03:28:34.404]  Awesome!
[03:28:34.804 --> 03:28:36.866]  Again, she is the victim here.
[03:28:37.466 --> 03:28:40.029]  What difference at this point does it make?
[03:28:42.992 --> 03:28:46.635]  She's the victim here, and they were saying that she attacked some of those women.
[03:28:47.036 --> 03:28:47.976]  They're lucky!
[03:28:47.996 --> 03:28:49.378]  Hillary's a good leader.
[03:28:49.578 --> 03:28:50.499]  I trust Hillary.
[03:29:00.306 --> 03:29:01.747]  That is plentiful, sir, that's well, oh yeah.
[03:29:01.787 --> 03:29:02.168]  No, not the chop.
[03:29:02.188 --> 03:29:03.649]  Not the meat, sir, the meat.
[03:29:03.709 --> 03:29:05.170]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:05.190 --> 03:29:06.111]  Not the meat, sir, the meat.
[03:29:06.151 --> 03:29:07.272]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:07.312 --> 03:29:08.273]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:08.293 --> 03:29:08.913]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:09.114 --> 03:29:09.694]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:09.734 --> 03:29:10.415]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:10.495 --> 03:29:11.476]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:11.556 --> 03:29:12.476]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:12.496 --> 03:29:13.317]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:13.337 --> 03:29:14.818]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:14.838 --> 03:29:15.459]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:15.499 --> 03:29:16.139]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:16.160 --> 03:29:17.381]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:17.501 --> 03:29:18.762]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:18.782 --> 03:29:19.382]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:19.442 --> 03:29:20.263]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:20.283 --> 03:29:21.124]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:21.144 --> 03:29:21.764]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:21.824 --> 03:29:22.805]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:22.825 --> 03:29:23.606]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:23.626 --> 03:29:24.246]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:24.286 --> 03:29:25.187]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:25.207 --> 03:29:25.848]  Oh, sir, not the meat.
[03:29:25.928 --> 03:29:26.268]  Oh
[03:29:29.777 --> 03:29:30.838]  This is real pleasure.
[03:29:30.918 --> 03:29:31.759]  I'm over the moon.
[03:29:41.034 --> 03:29:51.980]  I mean apparently Hillary grabs more you-know-what than Trump does.
[03:29:52.000 --> 03:29:55.622]  That's actually Hillary in the footage.
[03:29:55.762 --> 03:29:56.482]  They're taking over.
[03:29:57.182 --> 03:29:58.923]  We'll put the full video up at the end of this.
[03:29:58.943 --> 03:29:59.784]  We're on the march.
[03:30:00.284 --> 03:30:01.865]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:01.885 --> 03:30:02.365]  Danny what?
[03:30:02.825 --> 03:30:03.405]  Alex Jones.
[03:30:03.425 --> 03:30:04.566]  Danny Williams exclusive.
[03:30:04.686 --> 03:30:06.547]  Bill Clinton's son reportedly in full wars.com
[03:30:09.557 --> 03:30:12.799]  Hey, it's another story by the Lord of the Flies, Hillary Clinton.
[03:30:12.860 --> 03:30:17.023]  Hillary worried about jihadists entering with refugees in private speech.
[03:30:17.703 --> 03:30:19.625]  I'm not loving it.
[03:30:19.785 --> 03:30:20.986]  Duh, we could have told you that.
[03:30:21.126 --> 03:30:25.449]  In a private 2000 speech, Hillary Clinton worried about the risk of jihadists entering Jordan.
[03:30:25.609 --> 03:30:29.331]  With legitimate refugees because they can't possibly vet all those refugees.
[03:30:29.391 --> 03:30:30.732]  Yeah, we know you can't vet them all.
[03:30:30.792 --> 03:30:36.776]  And yet, you want to allow 55,000 Syrians to come in annually unvetted.
[03:30:36.896 --> 03:30:49.584]  But you're going to go to this private luncheon and tell them that it's probably a bad idea to take in refugees because of the fact there could be some extremists that get in there and then come over here to America and possibly chop off our heads.
[03:30:49.704 --> 03:30:51.285]  We've been saying that since day one.
[03:30:51.425 --> 03:30:52.466]  We need to secure the border!
[03:30:52.486 --> 03:31:00.332]  We need someone like Donald Trump to come in here and make America great again, because the Clintons have done nothing but fail their entire political career, and I'm sick and tired of it.
[03:31:00.372 --> 03:31:05.976]  So November 8th, get your butt to the polls, go out there, vote, make America great again, let's secure those borders.
[03:31:06.096 --> 03:31:09.179]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[03:31:09.439 --> 03:31:11.741]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:31:13.902 --> 03:31:24.949]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[03:31:25.009 --> 03:31:29.932]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[03:31:30.052 --> 03:31:34.035]  It helps balance the thyroid gland, it helps detoxify.
[03:31:34.335 --> 03:31:37.157]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[03:31:37.217 --> 03:31:41.961]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[03:31:42.001 --> 03:31:48.226]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[03:31:48.246 --> 03:31:53.571]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[03:31:53.671 --> 03:31:55.112]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[03:31:55.312 --> 03:31:56.033]  This is so key.
[03:31:56.293 --> 03:32:00.436]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring.
[03:32:00.516 --> 03:32:02.678]  And we believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[03:32:09.722 --> 03:32:14.825]  With the election just around the corner, I have to ask, have you gotten your Hillary for Prison t-shirt yet?
[03:32:15.325 --> 03:32:18.647]  After the election, this t-shirt will no longer be available.
[03:32:18.867 --> 03:32:24.510]  We only have a finite number of these, so be sure to get to Infowarsstore.com and get yours today.
[03:32:25.051 --> 03:32:28.933]  Even Hillary Clinton supporters like the Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[03:32:29.153 --> 03:32:30.554]  I'm voting for Hillary.
[03:32:30.854 --> 03:32:34.058]  This is a meme that is still viral worldwide.
[03:32:34.278 --> 03:32:35.180]  Hillary for prison.
[03:32:35.500 --> 03:32:41.207]  Folks, we want to see Hillary Clinton put in prison, and we also want to see InfoWars go to the next level.
[03:32:41.568 --> 03:32:48.076]  It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.
[03:32:48.737 --> 03:32:49.638]  Because you'd be in jail.
[03:32:50.438 --> 03:32:51.559]  Help us accomplish both.
[03:32:52.059 --> 03:32:53.440]  Fund us in the InfoWars.
[03:32:53.720 --> 03:32:55.661]  Start a political discourse with your neighbor.
[03:32:55.981 --> 03:32:57.021]  Give a gift to a friend.

[03:33:24.366 --> 03:33:26.451]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:26.992 --> 03:33:31.942]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:33:39.011 --> 03:33:41.613]  All right, we've got about 30 minutes left in the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:41.673 --> 03:33:43.215]  We are deep into overdrive.
[03:33:43.295 --> 03:33:46.978]  I'm your host, Rob Dew, sitting in the Situation Room.
[03:33:47.858 --> 03:33:54.624]  And I've got in the other studio, the big studio, Joe Big sitting down with a couple Army Rangers, Nate Self and Joel Carpenter.
[03:33:55.925 --> 03:33:57.626]  We're going to talk a little bit about that.
[03:33:57.806 --> 03:33:59.488]  Actually, Joe did an interview with him earlier today.
[03:33:59.508 --> 03:34:01.329]  It's going to premiere on the Nightly News tonight.
[03:34:02.710 --> 03:34:09.936]  But these guys have written a book and they've also worked it as by working in special ops, they've had to deal with different types of classified material.
[03:34:09.956 --> 03:34:11.497]  So we're going to talk a little bit about
[03:34:12.037 --> 03:34:12.597]  We're good.
[03:34:30.903 --> 03:34:37.105]  The PIX11 news footage where they're talking about the, basically they were trying to divert your attention.
[03:34:37.145 --> 03:34:40.926]  They were trying to hide the fact that Hillary Clinton got trounced in the debate.
[03:34:41.207 --> 03:34:48.109]  So they're talking about the cardboard cameras people were holding, and they're talking about the big guy who asked the question about coal energy wearing the red sweater.
[03:34:48.369 --> 03:34:49.709]  He's the big winner of the debate.
[03:34:50.150 --> 03:34:51.630]  Because they can't admit that Trump won.
[03:34:51.910 --> 03:34:53.931]  So they have to do all this obfuscation.
[03:34:54.691 --> 03:35:12.401]  And then they let the cat out of the bag that the reason the Secret Service banned cell phone footage or cell phone cameras, okay, the reason they banned it is because they were afraid if you had stuff like this going on, let's see, let's put my flash on, of course now it's not going to work.
[03:35:13.622 --> 03:35:17.804]  If you had these cell phone flashes working, it was going to give Hillary a seizure.
[03:35:17.864 --> 03:35:22.667]  So let's go to that PIX11 clip now and here's, oh, oh, I could give her a seizure right there.
[03:35:22.707 --> 03:35:23.708]  So here we go, let's go to that footage.
[03:35:24.599 --> 03:35:27.720]  For those of you who watched to the bitter, bitter end of this, did you catch this?
[03:35:28.240 --> 03:35:30.681]  The comeback of the cardboard camera.
[03:35:30.741 --> 03:35:33.021]  Holy 80s driving to the photo mat, Batman.
[03:35:33.361 --> 03:35:36.402]  You know, we thought it was like a Secret Service thing, banning the cell phones.
[03:35:36.442 --> 03:35:40.763]  But then there was this whole nice diversion that was happening on Twitter too.
[03:35:40.963 --> 03:35:42.864]  Ken Bone winning the Twitter award.
[03:35:42.884 --> 03:35:43.604]  Look at this.
[03:35:43.844 --> 03:35:46.945]  You got the Ken Bone costume already on GQ.
[03:35:47.325 --> 03:35:52.286]  And then, we love the fact that the number one most retweeted tweet of the night
[03:35:52.706 --> 03:35:57.050]  More than 67,000 times from CUNY's own Bayoumi Mustapha, a professor there.
[03:35:57.450 --> 03:36:02.354]  I'm a Muslim and I would like to report a crazy man threatening a woman on a stage in Missouri.
[03:36:02.394 --> 03:36:02.694]  Wow.
[03:36:03.095 --> 03:36:04.015]  So what do you say guys?
[03:36:04.396 --> 03:36:06.057]  This would get rid of the selfie, right?
[03:36:06.657 --> 03:36:06.898]  No way.
[03:36:06.938 --> 03:36:08.519]  No way ever did selfies.
[03:36:08.599 --> 03:36:09.540]  Whoa, guys.
[03:36:09.560 --> 03:36:09.920]  You know what?
[03:36:09.940 --> 03:36:16.786]  This is the reason why it was banned apparently, because the Secret Service did not trust people to disable the flashes on their cameras.
[03:36:16.806 --> 03:36:17.426]  So interesting.
[03:36:17.446 --> 03:36:21.930]  And they were afraid it would sort of inspire Hillary's seizure disorder.
[03:36:23.004 --> 03:36:25.689]  Wow!
[03:36:25.789 --> 03:36:27.532]  She just said seizure disorder.
[03:36:28.754 --> 03:36:31.258]  But I thought Hillary was in perfect health.
[03:36:31.799 --> 03:36:33.201]  Bill Clinton said she works like a demon.
[03:36:33.242 --> 03:36:35.085]  Tim Kaine says he can barely keep up with her.
[03:36:37.332 --> 03:36:42.717]  We can't have flash photography around her, or we have to have this old 80s technology because she's used to that.
[03:36:42.737 --> 03:36:48.683]  I want to go to one more quick clip before we bring in our guest with Joe Biggs over in the war room.
[03:36:49.544 --> 03:36:52.567]  CNN voters, or CNN tells voters what to say.
[03:36:52.607 --> 03:36:55.931]  This is a CNN host who is, you can actually hear her coaching
[03:36:56.531 --> 03:36:59.212]  America already is great, but we are great because we are good.
[03:37:19.551 --> 03:37:27.137]  Alright, so I want to ask you, what was it about Hillary Clinton's argument that resonated with you following Donald Trump's defense of the video?
[03:37:28.438 --> 03:37:32.141]  She stated that America is already great, and I tend to agree with that.
[03:37:32.301 --> 03:37:36.985]  Though we are slow in progressing in a number of areas, we are progressing and we need to continue the momentum.
[03:37:37.966 --> 03:37:39.187]  Like a trained seal!
[03:37:39.507 --> 03:37:41.509]  She tells her what to say, then she repeats it.
[03:37:41.849 --> 03:37:44.071]  And then we pretend that it's actual news.
[03:37:44.131 --> 03:37:46.033]  That's what they're doing over at CNN.
[03:37:46.733 --> 03:37:47.074]  What was that?
[03:37:47.094 --> 03:37:47.514]  I didn't hear you.
[03:37:50.871 --> 03:37:54.133]  I heard somebody say something in my ear, but I don't know if they're giving me direction or not.
[03:37:54.673 --> 03:37:59.715]  I was too busy clapping like a seal, performing like they tell me to do at CNN, because that's what they do.
[03:37:59.735 --> 03:38:02.236]  They want you to perform for the camera.
[03:38:03.217 --> 03:38:12.041]  I'm not going to have time to go to this video, but we just posted this from Millennial Millie, one of our InfoWars reporters, traveling around, just doing a great job shooting reports.
[03:38:12.161 --> 03:38:19.505]  And she went to a rally in Pennsylvania, I think it was Ambridge, Pennsylvania, talked to Trump supporters and Clinton supporters.
[03:38:20.505 --> 03:38:23.967]  And, you know, I'm going to let you judge the difference in those people.
[03:38:23.987 --> 03:38:24.767]  But you can check out that.
[03:38:24.787 --> 03:38:26.588]  It's on Infowars.com right now.
[03:38:26.648 --> 03:38:31.011]  Trump Patriots vs. Looney Protesters at PA Post Debate Rally.
[03:38:32.253 --> 03:38:32.973]  And it's amazing.
[03:38:33.854 --> 03:38:36.715]  She interviews a guy who says it's not a big deal that Clinton raped those women.
[03:38:36.736 --> 03:38:37.496]  That's in the past.
[03:38:37.696 --> 03:38:38.236]  That's in the past.
[03:38:38.456 --> 03:38:39.857]  But it's a big deal Bill Cosby raped them.
[03:38:40.237 --> 03:38:41.218]  Because that's in the past too.
[03:38:41.258 --> 03:38:43.299]  But it's Bill Cosby and we're going to go after him.
[03:38:44.160 --> 03:38:45.440]  Because we don't like him for some reason.
[03:38:45.680 --> 03:38:50.363]  Because he was calling out young black men for wearing their pants down to their ankles.
[03:38:50.903 --> 03:38:51.644]  They don't like that.
[03:38:51.684 --> 03:38:53.105]  They like to keep that image going.
[03:38:54.946 --> 03:39:02.831]  And before we go to our guest, real quick, if you're not supporting us at InfoWarsStore.com, please consider doing that, especially with our InfoWars Life products.
[03:39:02.851 --> 03:39:07.655]  We now have the Biome Defense, a probiotic I just started taking.
[03:39:07.675 --> 03:39:10.177]  It's definitely increased my energy.
[03:39:10.397 --> 03:39:17.642]  The BioTrue Selenium we have also, and we have 23% off DNA Force going on right now.
[03:39:17.722 --> 03:39:22.005]  Also got Brain Force, Supramel Vitality, the amazing Survival Shield X2.
[03:39:23.837 --> 03:39:24.117]  I think so.
[03:39:38.974 --> 03:39:43.339]  Being able to hire more staff so we could do these long, these live events that happen.
[03:39:43.820 --> 03:39:48.906]  You know, I don't know if people know this, but last week we did the WikiLeaks and then the VP Debate.
[03:39:49.066 --> 03:39:54.012]  Pretty much in a 24-hour span, we were doing two live events plus the show plus the nightly news.
[03:39:54.713 --> 03:39:58.995]  So, and this is just the crew that we have.
[03:39:59.175 --> 03:40:01.737]  Some of the crew members are standing up here 12, 13, 15 hours.
[03:40:02.157 --> 03:40:02.917]  Amazing stuff.
[03:40:03.338 --> 03:40:09.201]  So let's go to the war room where we have Joe Biggs standing by with Nate Self and Joel Carpenter.
[03:40:09.261 --> 03:40:10.582]  These are two Army Rangers.
[03:40:10.962 --> 03:40:18.126]  And guys, let's get into Clinton's use of classified emails and how you guys have basically been entrusted with
[03:40:18.706 --> 03:40:22.914]  The same type of information that she was getting, but classified information.
[03:40:23.034 --> 03:40:27.442]  And you're not allowed to just willy-nilly put it on servers in your bathrooms, are you?
[03:40:29.005 --> 03:40:29.565]  No, not at all.
[03:40:29.585 --> 03:40:38.331]  I mean, me and Nate and Joel were talking back in the green room, and we were talking about how it's interesting that, okay, you know, classifications, you know, things can change over time, right?
[03:40:38.691 --> 03:40:41.213]  Something can go from not being classified to classified.
[03:40:41.613 --> 03:40:42.714]  But you brought up a good point.
[03:40:42.774 --> 03:40:47.036]  It's not the fact that it went from not being classified to classified.
[03:40:47.096 --> 03:40:52.620]  It's the fact that she used her personal email server, her personal computer,
[03:40:53.786 --> 03:40:55.908]  To do work stuff on, and that is the big no.
[03:41:08.052 --> 03:41:15.474]  Pretty much a bunch of nothing, just I love you because we knew that people were listening to the phones, friendly and enemy, and it wasn't worth the risk at that time.
[03:41:16.214 --> 03:41:21.395]  I couldn't even tell her what time of day it was because I didn't want to give away to anyone what part of the world we were in.
[03:41:22.156 --> 03:41:35.519]  And all the way down to our lowest privates, who didn't have that much time in the army or in special operations, they knew that every channel that we had that wasn't specifically classified was off limits for talking about work.
[03:41:36.547 --> 03:41:38.008]  Yeah, and that's what people don't understand.
[03:41:38.308 --> 03:41:40.310]  Hillary Clinton knew that this was happening.
[03:41:40.670 --> 03:41:46.735]  We have the proof from the FBI that this was going on, and yet they come out and say, oh, there's nothing we can do about it, no one's going to prosecute it.
[03:41:47.015 --> 03:41:51.818]  But if it were you or I, or Joel, and we did something like that, we would be in Leavenworth right now, you know?
[03:41:52.259 --> 03:41:57.703]  And she has this political privilege that she's able to go and do whatever she wants, and it's fine.
[03:41:57.763 --> 03:42:00.785]  Bill can do whatever he wants and treat women like crap, and it's okay.
[03:42:00.805 --> 03:42:02.226]  We were talking in the Green Room as well.
[03:42:02.566 --> 03:42:05.589]  Another interesting point is the fact that everyone's hammering Trump right now,
[03:42:06.189 --> 03:42:11.955]  On the fact that these Trump tapes came out and that he said some things in the back, you know, while he thought he was off camera.
[03:42:12.296 --> 03:42:20.784]  Don't tell me a single guy out there who has never said something like that, or a female who has never said something like that, because I've been out with my girlfriend on her girl nights, and I've heard women talk before.
[03:42:21.365 --> 03:42:22.566]  They say just as bad things.
[03:42:22.927 --> 03:42:26.410]  But Joel was bringing up a good point about the 50 Shades of Grey thing.
[03:42:27.366 --> 03:42:39.257]  Yeah, so I just find it interesting that, you know, everybody hops on the bandwagon kind of and talks about how horrible it is, whatever Trump has said, when, you know, we have movies that come out like Fifty Shades of Grey.
[03:42:39.637 --> 03:42:40.498]  Objectifying women.
[03:42:40.658 --> 03:42:41.219]  Exactly.
[03:42:41.479 --> 03:42:47.685]  And then it sold 125 million copies worldwide and it made a half a billion dollars in the box office.
[03:42:48.105 --> 03:42:52.870]  So who's buying these books and who's going to see the movie to drive that sort of box office?
[03:42:53.590 --> 03:42:58.532]  And do they feel the same way about Fifty Shades of Grey as they do about what Trump said?
[03:42:58.952 --> 03:43:00.312]  Yeah, Trump said something.
[03:43:00.412 --> 03:43:01.913]  Bill Clinton did something.
[03:43:02.713 --> 03:43:08.075]  And guys, if I could jump in real quick, any Kevin Smith movie you've ever watched has language worse, way worse.
[03:43:08.235 --> 03:43:12.176]  I mean, you just look at what we throw out in our landscape in media.
[03:43:13.531 --> 03:43:16.493]  It's curse this, it's curse that, sexual innuendos, the rap music.
[03:43:16.874 --> 03:43:20.777]  So, for one reason, I'm not surprised that Trump would use this kind of language.
[03:43:20.797 --> 03:43:23.739]  That doesn't really surprise me that anyone would use this type of language.
[03:43:24.178 --> 03:43:28.903]  But then to just say that he's the only person in the world to ever use the P word.
[03:43:28.923 --> 03:43:32.046]  Hillary Clinton called all black people super predators.
[03:43:32.126 --> 03:43:32.346]  Right.
[03:43:33.367 --> 03:43:35.009]  But no one's going to say anything about that.
[03:43:35.069 --> 03:43:36.450]  No one's mad about that.
[03:43:36.771 --> 03:43:39.974]  They're mad because Trump said he was going to fondle a lady.
[03:43:40.414 --> 03:43:41.415]  I've been in locker rooms.
[03:43:41.495 --> 03:43:42.516]  I've been in the military.
[03:43:42.817 --> 03:43:44.698]  I've heard way worse talk before.
[03:43:45.119 --> 03:43:48.002]  And the fact that the Bush has held onto this for so long.
[03:43:49.082 --> 03:43:50.723]  They're using this for political purposes.
[03:43:51.044 --> 03:43:53.265]  They don't care because they've all said the same stuff.
[03:43:53.505 --> 03:44:00.369]  If we were to dig into any one of these Bush guys, I guarantee you, especially George W. Bush, we would probably hear far worse things.
[03:44:00.449 --> 03:44:02.511]  But hey, let's not focus on that.
[03:44:02.531 --> 03:44:04.432]  Let's go after the one guy who's actually going to do something.
[03:44:04.452 --> 03:44:10.555]  Notice they flushed their minion down the toilet now that Billy Bush performed and he was like, oh, I remember I talked to Trump about this and they got the stuff together.
[03:44:10.856 --> 03:44:11.496]  Now he's gone.
[03:44:11.696 --> 03:44:13.517]  He's been suspended from the Today Show.
[03:44:13.917 --> 03:44:15.498]  So that's what happens when you work with these people.
[03:44:15.518 --> 03:44:17.840]  They will flush you down the toilet when they're done working with you.
[03:44:18.499 --> 03:44:20.020]  Or kill you, whoever comes first.
[03:44:20.560 --> 03:44:23.681]  So I'm here in the studio now with Nate Self and Joel Carpenter.
[03:44:23.721 --> 03:44:26.603]  They were in the 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment.
[03:44:27.123 --> 03:44:32.865]  And today we actually had an opportunity to talk about the book that Nate wrote, My Two Wars.
[03:44:33.286 --> 03:44:38.728]  And he was part of a very intense battle in Afghanistan called the Battle of Takhar Gar.
[03:44:39.228 --> 03:44:42.009]  And tell us about that, you know, go into a little detail about that.
[03:44:42.029 --> 03:44:45.191]  A lot of people might have never heard about that, but it's very interesting.
[03:44:46.288 --> 03:44:46.768]  Thanks, Joe.
[03:44:47.669 --> 03:44:55.573]  Yeah, I was privileged enough to serve with the 75th Ranger Regiment, which is one of our most elite army forces, infantry forces.
[03:44:55.853 --> 03:45:05.578]  And I went to Afghanistan shortly after 9-11, and we assumed the mission to kill or capture al Qaeda's top leaders when we were there.
[03:45:06.465 --> 03:45:12.711]  And, uh, you know, early in the war, um, that was a pretty difficult thing to do to find exactly where they were.
[03:45:12.731 --> 03:45:19.958]  Um, but daily we were flying on missions trying to find, um, you know, people that were responsible for attacking us on 9-11.
[03:45:21.383 --> 03:45:32.296]  And a couple of months into that deployment, we had a specific pocket of Al Qaeda fighters that were in the southeastern part of Afghanistan, and we made a decision to go in after them.
[03:45:32.817 --> 03:45:36.321]  And part of that operation, which came to be known as Operation Anaconda,
[03:45:36.994 --> 03:45:37.194]  I don't
[03:45:55.663 --> 03:46:08.866]  And as they were infiltrating, they essentially landed in an enemy position, came under fire, and as the pilot flew away, one of the SEAL Team members fell out of the back of the helicopter into enemy hands.
[03:46:10.107 --> 03:46:13.407]  Essentially surrounded, cut off, alone, as his helicopter flew away.
[03:46:14.088 --> 03:46:16.488]  His name is Neil Roberts, member of SEAL Team 6.
[03:46:17.629 --> 03:46:22.710]  And after one failed rescue attempt, my team was called to come in and try to find him.
[03:46:23.910 --> 03:46:26.891]  And we were also shot down in the same mountain.
[03:46:27.291 --> 03:46:31.332]  So it was, if I'm not correct, you said it was you, it was 10 people on the helicopter, right?
[03:46:31.872 --> 03:46:43.374]  So it was 10 Rangers in that first wave, then you had another wave that was coming in afterwards, you guys came in separately, your helicopter was shot down, and then from there you guys were in a pretty intense battle for quite some time.
[03:46:43.414 --> 03:46:47.835]  Tell us about what happened once the helicopter went down, what you guys did, and how that unfolded.
[03:46:48.075 --> 03:46:52.118]  Well, the assault team was two teams of Rangers across two helicopters, and I was in the lead helicopter.
[03:46:52.138 --> 03:46:53.960]  And when we went in, it was just before sunup.
[03:46:54.740 --> 03:46:58.464]  We got shot down in the same landing zone the SEALs had been shot up in.
[03:46:59.104 --> 03:47:06.910]  And as soon as we hit the ground, it was very intense gunfire, rocket propelled grenades and machine gun fire coming through both sides of the aircraft.
[03:47:07.731 --> 03:47:08.351]  Yeah, everything.
[03:47:08.851 --> 03:47:10.152]  Everything they had was thrown at us.
[03:47:10.172 --> 03:47:16.615]  We were essentially in a kill zone of an ambush on our landing zone and kind of trapped inside the helicopter.
[03:47:16.655 --> 03:47:23.057]  So as we started to get out of the back of the helicopter, several other Rangers were wounded or killed getting off the aircraft.
[03:47:23.177 --> 03:47:26.218]  And frankly, none of us should have gotten out of the aircraft alive.
[03:47:27.959 --> 03:47:39.752]  But my team, along with the aircrew that started the fight also, that was more than the 10, but we had many wounded and killed at that point, began to fight just before sunup.
[03:47:40.793 --> 03:47:48.181]  Knee-deep snow on top of this mountain, about 10,000 feet above sea level, and just started to try to take the fight to the enemy.
[03:47:50.458 --> 03:47:50.678]  I think?
[03:48:14.398 --> 03:48:15.740]  Of his original SEAL team.
[03:48:15.760 --> 03:48:17.421]  They went up there and tried to find him.
[03:48:17.481 --> 03:48:18.062]  Couldn't find him.
[03:48:18.702 --> 03:48:21.325]  And John Chapman was killed up there as well.
[03:48:23.487 --> 03:48:27.711]  Five men on board my aircraft were killed, laying down their lives to bring one home.
[03:48:29.411 --> 03:48:30.212]  Yeah, that's intense.
[03:48:30.292 --> 03:48:31.233]  I mean, think about this.
[03:48:31.433 --> 03:48:38.160]  You hear today in these new leaked emails that, in one of them, it says that Hillary hates everyday Americans.
[03:48:38.700 --> 03:48:43.785]  Everyday Americans who go out there and lay down their life to fight for freedom, to fight for America.
[03:48:43.805 --> 03:48:46.027]  You know, to me, that pisses me off.
[03:48:46.608 --> 03:48:49.591]  You know, you are a true hero, but she calls us deplorables.
[03:48:50.353 --> 03:49:06.216]  You know, that's the kind of political environment we are in right now, that we have someone who wants to bring back true Americana, patriotism, that it's okay to have a flag, that it's okay to say the Pledge of Allegiance, you know, and then we've got one lady who just hates America.
[03:49:06.656 --> 03:49:07.616]  What do you think about that?
[03:49:07.897 --> 03:49:08.777]  Well, those are strong words.
[03:49:09.457 --> 03:49:19.519]  And, you know, it's difficult to watch what's happened to our country and the situation with security and even domestically, the situation with security.
[03:49:20.299 --> 03:49:33.775]  But abroad as well, what's happened since we all were over there fighting those wars and those brothers and sisters that we have that are still over there and deploying to feel that level of disrespect.
[03:49:35.017 --> 03:49:35.878]  It's a tough one to take.
[03:49:37.130 --> 03:49:45.596]  Yeah, it's interesting, and we've seen the military move in such a direction that's just out of this world over the last eight years under Obama.
[03:49:46.056 --> 03:49:57.204]  We have these, now the military is going to pay for people to have these transgendered surgeries, but we have homeless veterans on every street corner, under every overpass, that are sitting there.
[03:49:57.544 --> 03:49:58.224]  They need help.
[03:49:58.585 --> 03:50:00.806]  The VA is allowing people to die in many areas.
[03:50:00.846 --> 03:50:01.587]  They're on wait lists.
[03:50:02.327 --> 03:50:07.412]  It's horrible, but you want to pay some guy that's confused to chop something off.
[03:50:07.692 --> 03:50:21.384]  We want to take $8 million a year to take care of the 0.03% of the people that deal with transgenderism, but we want to ignore the mass amounts of Americans, men and women, who are willing to fight for their country.
[03:50:23.288 --> 03:50:41.112]  Yeah, unfortunately, Joe, the after-combat story is one that I've lived personally, and it wasn't a pretty one for me, although I'm surviving and thriving now with the support of my family and the community and other veterans.
[03:50:41.592 --> 03:50:49.414]  It is sad to see the rate of veteran suicide, the rate of soldier or service member suicide that we've seen over the last decade or so.
[03:50:49.434 --> 03:50:52.095]  We just have to do more.
[03:50:52.335 --> 03:50:53.916]  I mean, they say there's 22 a day.
[03:50:53.996 --> 03:50:55.736]  I think it's even higher.
[03:50:55.776 --> 03:50:57.697]  I mean, I know three within this year alone.
[03:50:58.817 --> 03:51:09.201]  You know, three really good friends who are struggling, and I've known people who've gone to the VA time and time again in tears, crying, asking for help, and we just can't get it.
[03:51:09.782 --> 03:51:10.202]  Can't get it.
[03:51:10.742 --> 03:51:16.604]  And it literally is a tougher battle back here sometimes than it is when you're over there, because sometimes it was a lot easier.
[03:51:16.624 --> 03:51:18.225]  You had your friends around you.
[03:51:18.305 --> 03:51:19.465]  Everyone knew what was going on.
[03:51:19.745 --> 03:51:20.746]  When you get out, you're alone.
[03:51:21.306 --> 03:51:23.608]  Almost, essentially, you feel like you're the only one dealing with that.
[03:51:24.308 --> 03:51:29.973]  And you have this government that could really care less about you anymore because you're no longer serving, so to say.
[03:51:30.453 --> 03:51:35.997]  So they wanted to do everything they could for you while you're in, but once you get out, it's like, eh, you've got other things to worry about.
[03:51:36.017 --> 03:51:41.661]  We need to make sure our soldiers are wearing high heels so they can walk every day, you know, a mile in women's shoes.
[03:51:41.702 --> 03:51:45.645]  And those are the kind of training things that we see time and time again that are popping up.
[03:51:46.843 --> 03:51:52.725]  I want to commend both you guys for all this stuff, but is there anything else you'd like to say about that as well, how the Army's changing the direction it's going in?
[03:51:53.766 --> 03:52:05.370]  Yeah, I mean, you know, I personally have never suffered from a PTSD or anything, but I did have a difficult transition when I got out, you know, even continues in some ways today, but
[03:52:06.450 --> 03:52:09.873]  I think what you just were speaking of is that when you get out, you're on your own.
[03:52:10.474 --> 03:52:16.959]  Something that I started looking at was, you know, when you're brought into the military, there's an indoctrination.
[03:52:17.339 --> 03:52:17.920]  There has to be.
[03:52:18.460 --> 03:52:22.864]  And we're taught to, you know, live a collective model.
[03:52:23.545 --> 03:52:24.465]  And it works.
[03:52:24.525 --> 03:52:25.426]  It works in the military.
[03:52:27.932 --> 03:52:30.658]  You know, in other environments it doesn't necessarily work.
[03:52:31.340 --> 03:52:34.988]  But, you know, you put your heart into that and basically everything is shared.
[03:52:35.048 --> 03:52:37.634]  So it's ammo that's shared, food is shared, water is shared.
[03:52:38.837 --> 03:53:03.235]  And then when you get out, just like you said, now you're on your own, so there's an indoctrination, there's not necessarily an out-doctrination, you know, where somebody's looking at the psychological aspects of maybe someone who doesn't understand that, hey, wait a second, I lived and I was, you know, indoctrinated into a collective mentality, now I'm an individual again, and just for me to recognize
[03:53:03.996 --> 03:53:04.957]  That that's what happened.
[03:53:04.977 --> 03:53:15.364]  You know, a lot of times I would, I would always be just completely perplexed that, you know, okay, well, wait a second, that guy, when I knew him in the military, he wasn't that squared away and now he's flourishing on the outside.
[03:53:15.404 --> 03:53:23.769]  And I think about it and I'm thinking, okay, well, wait, maybe because he never really invested into the collective of the military and the brotherhood of, you know, combat.
[03:53:24.350 --> 03:53:26.311]  And that's the reason why he wasn't that good at that.
[03:53:26.711 --> 03:53:33.356]  But then when he got out, he was very good at being an individual and, you know, becoming an entrepreneur and some of the things that maybe veterans
[03:53:34.616 --> 03:53:35.677]  Find challenging.
[03:53:35.777 --> 03:53:36.437]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:53:37.778 --> 03:53:41.359]  So before we end the show today, tell us about your website.
[03:53:41.399 --> 03:53:44.941]  Tell us about the book, your upcoming projects, and what we can look forward to, Nate.
[03:53:45.882 --> 03:53:50.364]  Yeah, well, I have a personal website called NateSelf.com, which is my name.
[03:53:51.184 --> 03:53:53.485]  The business that I lead is called Praevious.com.
[03:53:53.505 --> 03:53:55.426]  That's P-R-A-E-V-I-U-S.
[03:53:55.486 --> 03:53:58.547]  It's Latin meaning to lead the way or to come before.
[03:53:59.028 --> 03:54:01.429]  And we generally do leadership.
[03:54:02.149 --> 03:54:30.654]  Training and leader development work Joel and I have he approached me a few years ago And he had been really passionate about the story of what happened on that mountain Almost 15 years ago, and he had already begun adapting My book and what he knew about the story into a screenplay, and so we've partnered on trying to bring this story To the rest of America in a way that they could really experience it so if you guys What was I gonna say
[03:54:32.884 --> 03:54:41.886]  What are some of the things that you really find interesting right now that's going on in this political atmosphere with the upcoming election on November 8th?
[03:54:41.987 --> 03:54:47.088]  You know, what do you want to tell some of these people out there that might be on the fence or anything out there like that?
[03:54:47.728 --> 03:54:50.569]  Well, my perspective on it is that you're going to hear more
[03:54:52.347 --> 03:54:53.728]  Stuff on both sides.
[03:54:54.969 --> 03:54:56.870]  We're not done hearing about both candidates.
[03:54:56.930 --> 03:54:57.950]  There's going to be a lot more.
[03:54:57.970 --> 03:55:02.693]  I think that we're only going to see more information about both of them.
[03:55:02.893 --> 03:55:04.014]  Really juicy information.
[03:55:05.014 --> 03:55:07.876]  But I think what you see here is two candidates.
[03:55:08.737 --> 03:55:12.519]  One who is living out a career in politics.
[03:55:13.319 --> 03:55:14.580]  We generally know what we're going to get.
[03:55:16.401 --> 03:55:17.082]  More of the same.
[03:55:18.384 --> 03:55:23.109]  And in a way, to me, it seems as if rules don't apply.
[03:55:23.609 --> 03:55:26.653]  Going back to just one example with emails.
[03:55:26.673 --> 03:55:28.295]  Double standard.
[03:55:28.355 --> 03:55:32.119]  Practically speaking, most employees in our great U.S.
[03:55:32.159 --> 03:55:32.559]  companies
[03:55:33.360 --> 03:55:40.464]  Would be facing serious disciplinary action or firing if they had used personal email for sensitive business matters.
[03:55:41.045 --> 03:55:43.546]  And we're talking about the commander in chief, potentially.
[03:55:44.687 --> 03:55:45.867]  I think that that's egregious.
[03:55:46.007 --> 03:55:47.648]  I think that it's there's no excuse for it.
[03:55:48.449 --> 03:55:50.790]  And it's absolutely double standard.
[03:55:52.671 --> 03:55:53.572]  It's pretty simple stuff.
[03:55:54.112 --> 03:55:58.915]  And if that's an indication for a disregard for the law,
[03:56:00.658 --> 03:56:03.999]  I don't expect it to change moving forward.
[03:56:04.599 --> 03:56:14.102]  On the other hand, you have someone who is absolutely an outsider who's willing to take on the status quo and willing to challenge the Clintons, frankly.
[03:56:14.622 --> 03:56:16.803]  And I think that the people that are
[03:56:17.703 --> 03:56:20.424]  Willing to sign up politically to challenge the Clintons.
[03:56:20.504 --> 03:56:24.905]  It's a pretty little small list of people and It's a pretty dangerous task.
[03:56:24.965 --> 03:56:34.368]  Yeah, it is because as you see More stuff will come out and I think we should just expect that and and take it in stride on both sides Joel
[03:56:36.252 --> 03:56:46.783]  I just think it's interesting, you know, as even as today where we see on some of the WikiLeaks where they're talking about, you know, the removal of civics from, you know, teaching.
[03:56:46.883 --> 03:56:54.310]  And I, for me personally, I found myself where I enlisted after 2001, September, October timeframe.
[03:56:55.451 --> 03:56:57.213]  And I wanted to go fight for the country.
[03:56:57.233 --> 03:56:58.935]  I wanted to do all these things out of patriotism.
[03:57:00.053 --> 03:57:07.902]  But then, after I'd ETS'd and gotten out, I'd realized that I'd done all these things that I'd never even actually read our Constitution.
[03:57:08.462 --> 03:57:13.107]  Which sounds crazy, because I was 26 years old, and I went back and read it.
[03:57:13.688 --> 03:57:16.791]  And so, I know that, you know,
[03:57:17.592 --> 03:57:24.576]  There wasn't, when I was being brought up, that wasn't something that was, you know, put in front of us in our schools and stuff like that.
[03:57:24.596 --> 03:57:25.717]  So I think it's really important.
[03:57:26.097 --> 03:57:33.602]  And I think that part of the reason that we're suffering so much today is because of that, you know, which is evidenced by even in that email, they like it that way.
[03:57:34.322 --> 03:57:37.665]  You know, when we're, when we're ill-informed, we don't know what's going on.
[03:57:37.685 --> 03:57:39.786]  We don't know what rights are being violated.
[03:57:40.981 --> 03:57:45.025]  You know, it's kind of like it's left up to circumstance at that point.
[03:57:45.105 --> 03:57:48.668]  It's left up to our controllers, guys, and I wholeheartedly agree.
[03:57:48.688 --> 03:57:49.289]  I think it's great.
[03:57:49.709 --> 03:57:59.699]  It's never too late to read your Constitution and educate yourself on the Bill of Rights, and I think that's a great lesson to end with today, because we are running up on the end of the four-hour Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:59.719 --> 03:58:01.281]  This is the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:58:02.101 --> 03:58:03.202]  I've been Rob Dewey, your host.
[03:58:03.222 --> 03:58:05.385]  We've got Joe Biggs, and let's see.
[03:58:05.945 --> 03:58:12.008]  Nate Self and Joel Carpenter, two Army Ranger veterans, to bring their perspective to this show.
[03:58:12.208 --> 03:58:16.830]  And I want to end it with just a little thing I tweeted out earlier this morning about 3 a.m.
[03:58:17.571 --> 03:58:19.071]  It's Crackhead Dave Chappelle.
[03:58:19.091 --> 03:58:21.713]  Y'all got any more of them Hillary Super PAC funded polls?
[03:58:21.753 --> 03:58:26.155]  That's right, Hillary Super PAC is funding polls out there because they want to tell you that Hillary Clinton's
[03:58:26.835 --> 03:58:27.355]  Way ahead.
[03:58:27.835 --> 03:58:29.055]  You can't do anything to stop it.
[03:58:29.355 --> 03:58:30.316]  So just lay down.
[03:58:30.656 --> 03:58:36.597]  Lay down, GI, as the lady in Tokyo Rose would say that.
[03:58:36.677 --> 03:58:37.417]  Lay down, GI.
[03:58:37.457 --> 03:58:37.857]  Lay down.
[03:58:38.537 --> 03:58:40.697]  And we will just roll over you with the New World Order.
[03:58:40.737 --> 03:58:42.278]  So don't forget to support us.

[03:58:59.625 --> 03:59:05.483]  In the second presidential debate, Donald J. Trump came out and really called out Bill Clinton for his...
