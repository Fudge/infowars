[00:00:10.438 --> 00:00:13.139]  Jakari Jackson reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:15.239]  Today we are in the city of Austin, Texas.
[00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:18.380]  We're on our way to see printable gun pioneer Cody Wilson.
[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:26.302]  Now you guys may recall Cody, he made headlines many years ago for his production of the Liberator, the first 3D printed pistol.
[00:00:26.623 --> 00:00:33.504]  Since then his technology has advanced and he actually has a shop that we're going to see where he assembles what is known as the Ghost Gunner.
[00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:38.326]  It's a mill that allows you to make, among many other things, a lower receiver for an AR-15.
[00:00:39.246 --> 00:00:45.808]  So we're going to go check out his shop and see what he thinks about the recent reasonable gun control proposals made by the President.
[00:00:46.608 --> 00:00:52.070]  Okay, so we're here with Cody Wilson and he's going to walk us through Defense Distributed and show us how he fabricates the Ghost Gunner.
[00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.470]  Cody?
[00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.170]  H-Car?
[00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.250]  Yes.
[00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.671]  Alright, you're in the shop, small shop.
[00:00:56.031 --> 00:00:56.691]  Let's come to the back.
[00:00:57.632 --> 00:00:58.372]  Assembly line model.
[00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.287]  As long as you're happy with the machine looking like this.
[00:01:02.807 --> 00:01:03.128]  Okay.
[00:01:03.388 --> 00:01:04.188]  That's what it looks like.
[00:01:04.268 --> 00:01:04.869]  That's what we make.
[00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:05.850]  There's no variation.
[00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.670]  Everything's the same.
[00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.932]  It's the Model T of personal assault weapon fabrication.
[00:01:10.393 --> 00:01:12.454]  We start with an empty shell over here.
[00:01:12.754 --> 00:01:16.657]  Machine proceeds around the assembly line in a U. Comes back down through here.
[00:01:17.927 --> 00:01:32.939]  Makes a lot of, takes a lot of sub-assemblies from the back, which are inserted as it goes, gets fitted out with electronics, power supply, we do a little bit of setup code testing, comes off the line, goes out the back door to your house.
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.141]  So what exactly does the Ghost Gunner do?
[00:01:36.643 --> 00:01:37.283]  The Ghost Gunner is...
[00:01:39.048 --> 00:01:42.372]  In actuality, just a mill, just a very tiny computer-controlled mill.
[00:01:42.652 --> 00:01:48.918]  A computer tells a moving end mill in space where to go, how to carve out a piece of aluminum that you can kind of bolt down to a work surface.
[00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:52.086]  Previous century technology.
[00:01:52.726 --> 00:01:56.128]  There is nothing in it, of it, that is itself revolutionary.
[00:01:56.528 --> 00:01:58.109]  But when you ask me, what does a ghost gunner do?
[00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:59.890]  I don't really think about the milling.
[00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.111]  I think about what it does to the liberal imagination.
[00:02:02.591 --> 00:02:05.893]  What it does to the elitist gun control imaginary.
[00:02:06.173 --> 00:02:06.674]  It destroys it.
[00:02:06.974 --> 00:02:08.154]  That's what the ghost gunner really does.
[00:02:08.475 --> 00:02:14.318]  And now secretly, in garages in a neighborhood near you, someone may, or may not be, manufacturing an AR-15 in their garage.
[00:02:15.185 --> 00:02:20.808]  The Ghost Gunner has a price tag of $1,500 and sports a very long waiting list.
[00:02:21.468 --> 00:02:31.473]  Cody's machine has the ability to take a hunk of billet aluminum, known as an 80% lower receiver, and mill it into a principal part of an AR-15 rifle.
[00:02:32.034 --> 00:02:35.496]  But as one might expect, not all politicians are on board.
[00:02:35.956 --> 00:02:41.819]  This, again, is the engine to the high-powered semi-automatic assault weapons that you see displayed here today.
[00:02:42.813 --> 00:02:50.839]  With that, the lower receiver, an individual can buy this $80 to $100 online.
[00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:56.182]  This doesn't have a serial number, and it doesn't require a background check.
[00:02:57.283 --> 00:03:00.965]  All the person has to do, go to someone who has a drool press.
[00:03:01.826 --> 00:03:04.428]  You are a self-proclaimed anarchist, correct?
[00:03:05.048 --> 00:03:07.230]  Yeah, look, I'm anti-state now, all the way.
[00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.472]  Does your philosophy further your technology or your drive for technology?
[00:03:11.564 --> 00:03:13.365]  My technology furthers my philosophy.
[00:03:14.105 --> 00:03:16.486]  I'm not sure if the philosophy is furthering the technology that much.
[00:03:16.526 --> 00:03:23.190]  I mean, our insight is that change is tool-based and can be technically based.
[00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.252]  But I hope that I don't lapse into a certain kind of arrogant technicism.
[00:03:28.372 --> 00:03:35.036]  In 2016, President Obama made headlines by outlining plans for biometric GPS-tracked firearms.
[00:03:36.436 --> 00:03:39.158]  We need to develop new technologies that make guns safer.
[00:03:40.103 --> 00:03:50.534]  If we can set it up so you can't unlock your phone unless you got the right fingerprint, why can't we do the same thing for our guns?
[00:03:54.122 --> 00:03:57.543]  Do you have any plans to make a fingerprint scanner for... A ghost gunner?
[00:03:58.304 --> 00:03:59.284]  Not at all, GKari.
[00:03:59.404 --> 00:04:01.305]  I want every ghost gunner to look like its brother.
[00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:08.307]  I want to take as little information as legally necessary to manufacture, to ship.
[00:04:08.447 --> 00:04:12.409]  The capital stock of guns in this country will never be converted into these new guns.
[00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.890]  And we will never see a similar capital stock of these biometric-enabled guns.
[00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.592]  And there is no way of even demanding, under any statutory authority present,
[00:04:22.552 --> 00:04:26.955]  That same level of biometrics and whatever, smart technology in my machine.
[00:04:27.075 --> 00:04:28.096]  My machine is a milling tool.
[00:04:28.576 --> 00:04:32.099]  It's like saying, well, should your hammer have, you know, fingerprint technology?
[00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:33.400]  It's the same thing, you know?
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.884]  Well, let me ask you, how long until a product that comes out of a ghost gunner is military-grade technology?
[00:04:39.504 --> 00:04:42.867]  Look, I'll answer the question that it's military-grade now.
[00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.891]  Commercial lower receivers for AR-15s are machined aluminum, often billet aluminum.
[00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:51.392]  You're getting the exact same product off of the Ghost Gunner.
[00:04:51.992 --> 00:04:58.274]  Two military specifications, because we base our fixturing and our software around the military spec of the AR-15 lower.
[00:04:58.334 --> 00:05:03.556]  So you're getting functionally, materially identical components to the military component.
[00:05:05.038 --> 00:05:06.140]  Now, Cody, you went to UT.
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.562]  Did you study engineering, or what did you study there?
[00:05:08.923 --> 00:05:10.925]  No, man, I studied law at UT.
[00:05:10.985 --> 00:05:17.973]  A lot of the guys in this shop don't come from engineering backgrounds per se, but we think that the computer revolution, the digital revolution,
[00:05:19.071 --> 00:05:22.372]  Before the Ghost Gunner, Cody first shot to fame with the production of The Liberator.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.983]  A crude single-shot 3D printable gun.
[00:05:44.263 --> 00:05:48.287]  He used his skills and equipment to print things such as magazines as well.
[00:05:48.687 --> 00:05:49.348]  So consider this.
[00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:54.413]  A CAD file containing the information for a 3D printable weapon system.
[00:05:55.974 --> 00:05:58.357]  That file was seeded by 30 people, let's say.
[00:05:59.257 --> 00:06:02.621]  As long as there's a free internet, that file is available to anyone at any time.
[00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.271]  All over the world now, a gun can be anywhere.
[00:06:05.291 --> 00:06:06.492]  Any bullet is now a weapon.
[00:06:07.052 --> 00:06:10.393]  The defense distributors' goal isn't really personal armament.
[00:06:10.694 --> 00:06:12.114]  It's more the liberation of information.
[00:06:12.174 --> 00:06:16.136]  It's about living in a world where you just download the file for the thing you want to make in this life.
[00:06:16.176 --> 00:06:20.879]  This machine did all the principal liberator components for the liberator trials back in early 2013.
[00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:25.321]  It's an old 2003 Stratasys SST machine.
[00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:28.883]  I'm involved in a large lawsuit against the U.S.
[00:06:28.903 --> 00:06:31.004]  State Department that's now in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
[00:06:31.844 --> 00:06:40.970]  And that is fighting them over their total blanket ban on my posting of our work here, our research, our R&D efforts to the internet.
[00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:43.232]  They've literally targeted no one else in history.
[00:06:43.892 --> 00:06:46.694]  You can go to the Air 15 forums, you can go to any kind of catapult where you want.
[00:06:46.714 --> 00:06:48.736]  The gun files are all over the internet and have been for years.
[00:06:49.196 --> 00:06:50.897]  DOJ got back to Congress after...
[00:06:52.678 --> 00:06:57.461]  The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act and said, oh look, sorry, people can post bomb plans to the internet, free speech.
[00:06:57.761 --> 00:07:09.229]  But somehow after Liberator, the Obama administration was so embarrassed that they sicked the State Department on me and told me to prove it, how bad I wanted to do this kind of work.
[00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:11.750]  With this you're printing the lower receivers, correct?
[00:07:11.971 --> 00:07:12.571]  But for a 1911, how...
[00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:18.011]  How fully functional would a 1911 be coming out of a machine like this?
[00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:23.157]  In the very same way that we're not producing an entire AR-15 on this machine, you're producing, like, the receiver.
[00:07:24.638 --> 00:07:31.046]  In the 1911, there's a frame component that can be milled out of aluminum, which is also sometimes considered to be the regulated component.
[00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:37.748]  So we're talking about creating the regulated components of guns as much as we're talking about being able to meaningfully manufacture them.
[00:07:38.188 --> 00:07:47.371]  So if I can make my own AR-15 receiver, I sidestep the entire FFL registration serialization network and I can assemble my own private AR-15.
[00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:50.652]  But I don't make every single component of that AR-15 on this machine.
[00:07:50.672 --> 00:07:54.493]  I want to read you this quote from Kalashnikov, of course, the maker of the AK-47.
[00:07:55.014 --> 00:07:59.355]  I didn't want to design a weapon that was going to be used in widespread fratricidal war.
[00:07:59.955 --> 00:08:02.176]  I only wanted to help protect my country's borders.
[00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:06.197]  Now the Ghost Gunner, the Liberator, all this stuff is in its infancy.
[00:08:06.497 --> 00:08:09.418]  Let's say the technology advances, it becomes more widespread.
[00:08:10.018 --> 00:08:12.719]  There are more than a few bodies attributed to the technology.
[00:08:13.219 --> 00:08:17.621]  Do you foresee a day when Cody Wilson will share a sentiment similar to Kalashnikov?
[00:08:18.888 --> 00:08:20.609]  I share Kalashnikov's sentiment now.
[00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:26.994]  The rest of his sentiment was that he said, don't blame me for this technology and its use.
[00:08:27.174 --> 00:08:28.014]  Blame the politicians.
[00:08:28.374 --> 00:08:34.319]  Blame the nation-states and these large protracted wars, which are really the consequence of the behavior between states, as states.
[00:08:34.579 --> 00:08:35.499]  I have nothing to do with that.
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.762]  Whenever these people get on TV and point the finger at the hobbyists,
[00:08:39.798 --> 00:08:50.548]  They fail to mention how many AR-15s they themselves are shipping to Mexico, to Al-Nusra, through Turkey, with CIA operations and, you know, all over these theaters of war in the Middle East.
[00:08:50.888 --> 00:08:53.190]  I have nothing to do with that, now or will I ever.
[00:08:54.251 --> 00:08:56.674]  Obama cries for first-graders in Connecticut.
[00:08:57.494 --> 00:09:02.199]  Does he cry for the first-graders in any other country to which he's shipped these assault rifles?
[00:09:02.939 --> 00:09:03.320]  Himself?
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.661]  I didn't send them there.
[00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:05.722]  How'd they get there?
[00:09:12.833 --> 00:09:22.719]  Most of the InfoWars radio listening audience is aware of the high-quality, affordable firearms available that are made right here in America at HDFirearms.com.
