[00:00:20.188 --> 00:00:22.191]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:23.593]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.813 --> 00:00:27.798]  It is June 24th, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:31.544 --> 00:00:31.904]  Tonight!
[00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:42.364]  It's Independence Day in the UK, as a stunning populist revolt breaks the UN chain of the political establishment.
[00:00:42.845 --> 00:00:43.385]  Brexit!
[00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:46.127]  The dawn of a populist uprising.
[00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:49.829]  But don't expect the elite to take this lying down.
[00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:55.632]  Then, Bernie Sanders says he will vote for Hillary Clinton.
[00:00:56.632 --> 00:00:59.134]  Are you going to vote for Hillary Clinton in November?
[00:01:00.183 --> 00:01:00.403]  Yes.
[00:01:00.863 --> 00:01:06.267]  Yeah, I think the issue right here is I'm going to do everything I can to defeat Donald Trump.
[00:01:06.687 --> 00:01:10.189]  And why does the IRS need AR-15s?
[00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:15.952]  Jeff Duncan says he saw IRS special agents using semi-automatic rifles at a gun range.
[00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:20.115]  Now he wants answers to why the agency needs that type of firepower.
[00:01:20.495 --> 00:01:20.795]  Hmm.
[00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:25.578]  All that plus much more up next on InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.432]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com with an extremely important message.
[00:01:55.933 --> 00:02:00.916]  You're probably asking yourself right now, what's the most important phrase in America right now?
[00:02:01.456 --> 00:02:03.658]  Well, it happens to be Hillary for Prison.
[00:02:04.078 --> 00:02:07.420]  Get your Hillary for Prison t-shirt today at the InfoWars store for $9.95.
[00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:10.482]  That's half of what it used to be at $19.95.
[00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:12.904]  Why do you want to get this?
[00:02:12.964 --> 00:02:15.485]  Why should you buy this for you and your friends and family?
[00:02:15.826 --> 00:02:18.968]  Because number one, it's a great conversation starter, and number two,
[00:02:19.648 --> 00:02:24.212]  Hell, you get to trigger a whole lot of crazy liberal commie bastards, and that's what I like to do.
[00:02:24.552 --> 00:02:31.778]  And maybe you're just at work right now, and it's casual shirt Friday, and one of your hipster buddies walks in with a Hillary Clinton shirt saying, I'm with her.
[00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:32.599]  Negative!
[00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:33.360]  This is what you're gonna do.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:42.367]  You're gonna stand up and go, UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:50.447]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and get your Hillary for Prison shirt today for $9.95 and trigger more assholes like him.
[00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.270]  Come on, Hillary.
[00:02:53.471 --> 00:02:54.051]  Just a little.
[00:02:54.352 --> 00:02:55.132]  Just a little sip.
[00:02:55.693 --> 00:02:55.993]  Open up.
[00:02:56.314 --> 00:02:57.215]  Come on, take it!
[00:02:57.695 --> 00:02:58.076]  Take it!
[00:03:01.894 --> 00:03:09.299]  Brexit represents nothing less than a stunning populist revolt and a complete rejection of the political establishment.
[00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:22.228]  After months of endless fear-mongering and propaganda, after months of trying to shame us into voting remain, politicians, celebrities, economists, bankers, you all failed spectacularly.
[00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:25.671]  It's a victory for ordinary people, decent people.
[00:03:25.791 --> 00:03:26.872]  It's a victory against
[00:03:27.492 --> 00:03:32.594]  Brexit is also a devastating example of how the deceitful media is losing its power to control the narrative.
[00:03:32.634 --> 00:03:34.314]  But don't expect the elite to take this lying down.
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.661]  Here's what the political class will do in response.
[00:03:54.862 --> 00:04:00.704]  They'll blame the next ISIS terror attack in Europe on the instability caused by Brexit.
[00:04:00.844 --> 00:04:04.386]  As always, it will have nothing whatsoever to do with Islam.
[00:04:04.446 --> 00:04:11.710]  They'll blame the popping of the financial bubble that's been totally inevitable for years anyway on Brexit.
[00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.752]  They'll then try to offer Britain a new deal to stay in the EU.
[00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:20.676]  Or they'll just make us vote again in another referendum until they get the result they want.
[00:04:20.816 --> 00:04:23.758]  Like they did in France, Ireland and the Netherlands.
[00:04:23.918 --> 00:04:25.639]  These people are snakes.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.801]  Don't think the battle is won.
[00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:29.643]  It's only just beginning.
[00:04:29.783 --> 00:04:37.529]  Because the political class is backed up by an army of authoritarian, anti-democratic, leftist morons
[00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:42.770]  Thousands of whom have already signed a petition to hold another referendum.
[00:04:42.951 --> 00:04:47.732]  Sky News and the BBC are also floating this second referendum crap.
[00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:49.092]  Listen up lefties!
[00:04:49.493 --> 00:04:58.976]  I know you're upset that months of virtue signalling about how progressive you are for voting for Remain on Facebook has turned out to be a total waste of time.
[00:04:59.056 --> 00:05:00.036]  But you lost!
[00:05:00.416 --> 00:05:01.397]  Get over it.
[00:05:01.657 --> 00:05:09.163]  Maybe you'll now finally realise that calling people racist or Nazis over and over again isn't an argument.
[00:05:09.584 --> 00:05:11.225]  It doesn't work anymore.
[00:05:11.365 --> 00:05:13.027]  I mean, look at some of the reaction.
[00:05:13.307 --> 00:05:18.151]  The bed-wetting and the toy-throwing from leftists today is delectable.
[00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:22.832]  Brexit is an incredibly sad victory for racists and bigots, and much that is vile in the world.
[00:05:23.092 --> 00:05:28.213]  Oh look, another arrogant, sneering, loathsome elitist who is on the wrong side of history.
[00:05:28.333 --> 00:05:31.814]  Just like Obama and Hillary are on the wrong side of history.
[00:05:31.894 --> 00:05:35.274]  Today is like waking up to find out the Nazis won the Second World War!
[00:05:35.454 --> 00:05:37.695]  Yeah, that's not an overreaction at all, is it?
[00:05:37.855 --> 00:05:38.275]  I'm scared.
[00:05:38.455 --> 00:05:40.115]  Jokes aside, I'm actually scared.
[00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:43.216]  Today an older generation has voted to ruin the future for the younger generation.
[00:05:43.236 --> 00:05:43.616]  I'm scared!
[00:05:44.176 --> 00:05:51.763]  Oh, you mean the same older generation whose fathers fought and died to make sure you wouldn't be ruled from Germany in the first place?
[00:05:51.923 --> 00:05:55.566]  The fact older generations have reaped the benefits and pulled the EU from my generation?
[00:05:55.787 --> 00:05:56.247]  Furious!
[00:05:56.567 --> 00:05:57.868]  My generation wanted in!
[00:05:58.069 --> 00:05:58.829]  It's our time!
[00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:03.033]  Right, because youth unemployment in EU countries is really low, isn't it?
[00:06:03.093 --> 00:06:04.795]  Good to see we'll be staying in the EU.
[00:06:04.975 --> 00:06:07.657]  If I wake up to Nigel Farage's smiling face, I'll kill myself.
[00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:11.680]  Genuinely scared for the future?
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.260]  I know, right?
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.362]  What are we gonna do with all this new sovereignty and money?
[00:06:15.782 --> 00:06:16.763]  It's terrifying!
[00:06:16.923 --> 00:06:20.525]  But Brexit is about more than just getting out of the EU.
[00:06:20.665 --> 00:06:28.749]  It's about reclaiming some genuine sense of patriotism after decades of being told that we're a country whose glory days are long gone.
[00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:32.711]  A country that should constantly apologise for its colonial history.
[00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:36.554]  Constantly being derided as small-minded little Englanders.
[00:06:36.694 --> 00:06:39.135]  Constantly being lectured that we're racist.
[00:06:39.275 --> 00:06:42.798]  It's merely for expressing concern about mass immigration.
[00:06:42.858 --> 00:06:46.982]  This is a rejection of the politics of fear, the politics of grief.
[00:06:47.142 --> 00:06:49.784]  This is a new morning for Great Britain.
[00:06:49.864 --> 00:06:52.667]  This is the dawn of a populist uprising.
[00:06:52.727 --> 00:06:57.691]  This is a catalyst for the rest of Europe to throw off the shackles of the EU.
[00:06:57.772 --> 00:07:02.616]  Let's not allow the political class and the authoritarian left to hijack
[00:07:02.856 --> 00:07:05.258]  What we've all worked so hard to achieve.
[00:07:05.378 --> 00:07:09.801]  Brexit is a crushing victory for the people against the establishment.
[00:07:10.241 --> 00:07:11.202]  Get used to it.
[00:07:11.562 --> 00:07:13.403]  There are many more to come.
[00:07:14.304 --> 00:07:16.825]  That was a fantastic report from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:07:17.205 --> 00:07:20.448]  Now, you've heard what the crew has to say about this matter with the Brexit.
[00:07:20.968 --> 00:07:31.015]  And when it comes to politics, especially things that go on in other countries, I'm interested to hear opposing points of view because I'm always open to the fact that there may be something that I didn't take into account or
[00:07:31.835 --> 00:07:39.400]  Maybe I'm looking at through an American glass, an American type of system and maybe those views don't exactly match up with the people who live there on the ground.
[00:07:39.901 --> 00:07:53.310]  So I went to the interwebs and I found this article talking about British celebrities and pop culture icons reacting to the Brexit because you know celebrities just love to give their opinions on things if they think it will get them some publicity.
[00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.451]  Let's start with JK Rowling.
[00:07:55.911 --> 00:07:57.953]  She said Scotland will seek independence now.
[00:07:58.433 --> 00:08:00.836]  Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions.
[00:08:01.236 --> 00:08:02.858]  Neither needed to happen.
[00:08:03.198 --> 00:08:04.640]  Now, once again, I don't live there.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.462]  I don't know the sentiments of all the people there.
[00:08:06.502 --> 00:08:14.090]  But just looking at this concern about Scotland seeking independence, I don't know what's wrong with seeking independence because we have it here in this country.
[00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.612]  We celebrate every July 4th.
[00:08:16.172 --> 00:08:23.199]  So maybe she's looking at this at a different angle than I am, but just the fact that somebody may seek independence doesn't really bother me that much at all.
[00:08:23.479 --> 00:08:24.961]  We also have Hugh Laurie.
[00:08:25.021 --> 00:08:25.942]  He is Dr. House.
[00:08:26.322 --> 00:08:29.345]  He says the first hairline crack in the plasterwork.
[00:08:29.785 --> 00:08:33.429]  England fans will be paying 25 quid for a bottle of beer by Monday.
[00:08:33.849 --> 00:08:49.240]  Now, to this, Leanne went out earlier today and she shot a man on the street and she was talking to some of the people and they said that their currency has deflated, I guess is the proper terminology, and now their dollar or their euro or whatever is worth less now than it was before.
[00:08:49.321 --> 00:08:54.404]  So, we see this continuing and also, I was watching mainstream just a few minutes ago.
[00:08:54.444 --> 00:08:57.427]  They have the big stock market with the big red arrow going down.
[00:08:57.447 --> 00:08:58.247]  It was at 600 or so points.
[00:09:00.143 --> 00:09:03.845]  And it's bringing people to question, is this just a temporary growing pain?
[00:09:03.905 --> 00:09:06.526]  Is this something that's going to persist going on into the future?
[00:09:06.807 --> 00:09:17.352]  But many people, including financial analysts that we've had on this show, say that it's pretty much the bankers, people in charge, trying to scare people into rethinking the action that happened here today.
[00:09:17.412 --> 00:09:19.954]  But like I said, only time will tell.
[00:09:20.114 --> 00:09:22.755]  And there's another interesting one from MKO.
[00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:25.917]  I'm not exactly sure who that is, but they made it on USA Today.
[00:09:26.437 --> 00:09:28.378]  It says, Britain, don't play yourselves.
[00:09:28.418 --> 00:09:30.560]  You aren't the Beyonce of the EU.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.121]  Your solo career is very uncertain.
[00:09:33.161 --> 00:09:35.863]  Basically saying that you don't have what it takes.
[00:09:36.263 --> 00:09:37.604]  You know, like Beyonce was in Destiny's Child.
[00:09:37.624 --> 00:09:39.545]  You don't have what it takes to make it solo.
[00:09:40.285 --> 00:09:41.826]  So there's a lot of different opinions out there.
[00:09:41.846 --> 00:09:45.028]  I even made a rare Twitter post.
[00:09:45.369 --> 00:09:47.310]  We had this conversation a couple days ago.
[00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.672]  I think it was me, Biggs, and I think Marcos is back there running the board.
[00:09:51.292 --> 00:09:59.219]  And we're talking about how I don't post on Twitter all that much, and then Biggs told a bunch of his followers to follow me, and then I got a bunch of Biggs followers, so thank you, Rambo, Biggs followers.
[00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:05.244]  But I sent out this tweet today, and I really just wanted to get a feeling for what people thought about the Brexit.
[00:10:05.264 --> 00:10:08.486]  And I said, good, bad, indifferent, you know, my post wasn't leaning one way or the other.
[00:10:08.887 --> 00:10:14.952]  And I guess I should have been a little more specific, because I got a lot of Americans that responded, and I know they were Americans because they said that in their post.
[00:10:15.232 --> 00:10:17.033]  But for the few people who were in the EU,
[00:10:17.794 --> 00:10:18.475]  They were for it.
[00:10:19.075 --> 00:10:27.523]  Granted, you know, I have a lot of InfoWars followers and they have those type of viewpoints, but it's not all the type of opinions that I just read here is the point I'm trying to make to you.
[00:10:27.924 --> 00:10:30.686]  But we'll definitely be covering this in the coming weeks and months.
[00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:32.088]  Now let's talk about something else.
[00:10:32.268 --> 00:10:33.008]  As we talk about
[00:10:33.689 --> 00:10:40.473]  Diversity and things going on overseas, because we oftentimes look at it through the American glass, but what do people in other countries think?
[00:10:40.593 --> 00:10:45.977]  You think of the bathroom bills that are going on here, boycotts going on at Target, all those things going around.
[00:10:46.657 --> 00:10:55.943]  And when you talk about what you should call somebody, it's always that tricky thing, because there's always the politically correct terms, the preferred terms.
[00:10:56.243 --> 00:10:57.023]  I'll give you an example.
[00:10:57.043 --> 00:10:59.845]  We'll talk about the LGBT thing with this in just one second.
[00:11:00.345 --> 00:11:02.607]  I was at, I think, Comic-Con, of all places.
[00:11:02.967 --> 00:11:08.895]  I was talking to this guy, he was from the UK, and we were having this conversation and he was like, no, you're supposed to address me as sir.
[00:11:08.955 --> 00:11:10.898]  He said it politely, but he was correcting me.
[00:11:10.918 --> 00:11:12.540]  He's like, you're supposed to address me as sir.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.627]  And not sir as in the polite way, but like he's an actual sir going back to lineage.
[00:11:17.687 --> 00:11:20.511]  I'm not exactly sure what that is in their standards, but he was a sir.
[00:11:20.911 --> 00:11:26.575]  And I was like, bro, there is no way I was supposed to know that by looking and talking to you that you were a sir.
[00:11:26.595 --> 00:11:30.338]  But it's these type of politically correct things that they expect you to know.
[00:11:30.718 --> 00:11:37.864]  And now a German MP is trolling diversity by addressing 60 different genders before he started his speech.
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:12:02.192]  Dear androgynous, dear bi-gender, gender-variable, gender-queer, intersex, neither-gender, genderless, non-binary, pangender and pangender, trans-human, interstellar-male.
[00:12:02.212 --> 00:12:03.794]  Oh God, I thought you had an intermission.
[00:12:04.054 --> 00:12:05.475]  I'm not done with the welcome yet, Mr. President.
[00:12:05.495 --> 00:12:05.715]  Excuse me.
[00:12:08.168 --> 00:12:10.950]  And it begs the question, what are you supposed to call somebody?
[00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.932]  Can you say, uh, mother and father anymore?
[00:12:13.272 --> 00:12:14.613]  Some places don't want you to do that.
[00:12:14.633 --> 00:12:15.754]  That's not inclusive enough.
[00:12:16.014 --> 00:12:17.516]  You can't say, excuse me, sir.
[00:12:17.556 --> 00:12:18.476]  That's not inclusive enough.
[00:12:18.516 --> 00:12:19.117]  Excuse me, miss.
[00:12:19.417 --> 00:12:20.678]  You may offend somebody.
[00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:23.941]  Uh, and it's really no shortage of this going on.
[00:12:24.001 --> 00:12:27.784]  I remember that piece, uh, but Donde did a while back.
[00:12:27.804 --> 00:12:30.926]  He was talking to the Satanist and he was talking to a, uh,
[00:12:32.088 --> 00:12:34.971]  Man in drag, I guess is the most polite way I could say it.
[00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:38.674]  And he's like, excuse me, and she's like, I'm a lady.
[00:12:39.735 --> 00:12:41.937]  And it's just like, how are you supposed to know?
[00:12:42.457 --> 00:12:44.179]  Is it a long-haired guy or is it a lady?
[00:12:44.259 --> 00:12:45.540]  Like, how do they self-identify?
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:51.566]  There's no way to really know, so I think it is quite funny this guy decided to call him out on that.
[00:12:51.966 --> 00:12:59.033]  Now coming back here to some domestic news, you guys know we've done a lot of reports going along the border and talking about illegal immigration.
[00:12:59.634 --> 00:13:05.419]  And I had this conversation, or I have these recurring conversations with people, and they say that no person is illegal.
[00:13:05.499 --> 00:13:09.583]  I'm like, bro, I'm not saying that you're an illegal human being, that you don't have a right to exist.
[00:13:09.904 --> 00:13:12.526]  I'm saying that there's a legal way to enter the country.
[00:13:12.746 --> 00:13:13.047]  Example.
[00:13:13.667 --> 00:13:29.020]  I recently traveled outside of the country, off the continent as a matter of fact, and when I got to my destination, even though I had my documents, I had my passport, I had my visa, I had my back checked by TSA or whatever the foreign equivalent was, pat-downs the whole nine.
[00:13:29.461 --> 00:13:39.970]  With all that said, had I walked out of that airport without checking into customs, I would have committed a crime and thus committed, here comes that trigger word, illegal action, illegal activity.
[00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:40.971]  That's what it was.
[00:13:41.391 --> 00:13:44.474]  And same thing if you go out of your way to avoid a border checkpoint.
[00:13:44.734 --> 00:13:51.401]  You got a nice paved road going up to the border checkpoint, but you decide to walk through the bush, you know, getting attacked, you know, by rattlesnakes and stuff.
[00:13:51.721 --> 00:13:54.023]  You're going out of your way to avoid that checkpoint.
[00:13:54.464 --> 00:13:57.687]  So with this in mind, did you go through the checkpoint?
[00:13:57.727 --> 00:13:58.107]  Yes or no.
[00:13:58.147 --> 00:13:59.168]  Did you go through customs?
[00:13:59.188 --> 00:13:59.649]  Yes or no.
[00:13:59.789 --> 00:14:03.372]  If you answered no to either one of those questions, you entered the country illegally.
[00:14:03.392 --> 00:14:05.835]  It has nothing to do with race, religion,
[00:14:06.275 --> 00:14:06.796]  Why are you there?
[00:14:06.916 --> 00:14:07.657]  How long are you staying?
[00:14:07.677 --> 00:14:08.278]  Where are you going?
[00:14:08.358 --> 00:14:09.459]  Anything else like that?
[00:14:09.519 --> 00:14:10.921]  Did you come into the country legally?
[00:14:11.301 --> 00:14:12.382]  And now we see this story.
[00:14:12.843 --> 00:14:13.063]  U.S.
[00:14:13.103 --> 00:14:16.647]  soldiers arrested in alleged illegal immigration smuggling ring.
[00:14:17.512 --> 00:14:18.473]  says U.S.
[00:14:18.513 --> 00:14:27.077]  authorities are investigating an illegal immigration smuggling operation allegedly run by active duty military soldiers out of Fort Bliss and that's in El Paso.
[00:14:27.598 --> 00:14:35.542]  And Fort Bliss is the El Paso Intelligence Center, EPIC, that's quite the EPIC acronym, a Federal Tactical Operations Intelligence Center.
[00:14:36.122 --> 00:14:40.165]  We are aware that two Fort Bliss soldiers have been arrested, a spokesman said.
[00:14:40.805 --> 00:14:46.351]  We can confirm that they are both assigned to the 377 Transportation Company here.
[00:14:46.711 --> 00:14:50.975]  However, this is an ongoing investigation and we cannot comment further.
[00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:56.781]  It says that the soldiers were paid $1,000 each for a successful smuggling trip.
[00:14:56.801 --> 00:15:02.547]  They would have been paid $1,500 for a June 18th run, but they were busted by the Border Patrol.
[00:15:03.368 --> 00:15:09.334]  And this is always a thing, and I know we gave the Border Patrol a lot of heat, and there are things the Border Patrol does that I don't like.
[00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:16.161]  Like when they have the checkpoint, you know, a hundred miles from the border, and they're saying, are you an American citizen?
[00:15:16.321 --> 00:15:17.803]  I'm like, why are you asking me these questions?
[00:15:17.823 --> 00:15:18.964]  Like, well, we're doing immigration.
[00:15:19.004 --> 00:15:20.446]  I'm like, am I immigrating someplace?
[00:15:20.726 --> 00:15:22.948]  I'm going towards the United States, not Mexico.
[00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:24.229]  Why are you asking me these questions?
[00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:25.931]  So I don't like stuff like that.
[00:15:27.378 --> 00:15:33.240]  By and large, I think the Border Patrol does have their hands tied behind their back because they're told a bunch of stuff that they can or cannot do.
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:49.465]  We've seen the reports, not just our reports, you go down to South Texas and Falfuris, those areas like that, they have the local news going out to private land and she's standing there with a guy and the people are coming over the border and she said, the reporter, her words, it's like they're waiting for a bus.
[00:15:49.525 --> 00:15:53.886]  It's like they're at a bus stop just waiting for the Border Patrol to come and pick them up and take them to the station.
[00:15:54.266 --> 00:15:56.387]  And then eventually it'll get them the tickets to wherever they have to go.
[00:15:56.427 --> 00:15:57.428]  We brought you those reports.
[00:15:58.969 --> 00:16:04.212]  But with this, I do like to see the Border Patrol doing what they can to stop the flow of illegal immigration.
[00:16:04.252 --> 00:16:09.736]  Like I said, I have no issue with people who come here illegally, but there is a legal way in which to do that.
[00:16:10.652 --> 00:16:14.473]  Now talking about illegal activity, violations of your free speech.
[00:16:14.793 --> 00:16:20.575]  We see this all over the country, whether it's in schools or city council meetings or whatever else.
[00:16:21.175 --> 00:16:27.637]  They always want to stem your freedom of speech going as far as to even arrest guys for talking at city council meetings.
[00:16:27.717 --> 00:16:29.657]  It is completely ridiculous.
[00:16:29.757 --> 00:16:34.179]  But now the city of Cleveland is backtracking an earlier action that they put out.
[00:16:34.479 --> 00:16:35.439]  Originally they were saying that
[00:16:35.819 --> 00:16:47.761]  They were not going to allow pro-Donald Trump groups, or to be fair, anti-Donald Trump groups either, to come out and protest for him at the Cleveland Conventions, and now they're backing off of that.
[00:16:48.261 --> 00:16:48.701]  A U.S.
[00:16:48.761 --> 00:17:00.683]  District Judge agreed with pro-Trump organizations, represented by the ACLU, which sued Cleveland to overturn the rules governing protests during the July 18-21 convention.
[00:17:01.143 --> 00:17:04.764]  And they also go on to document how Black Lives Matter had a similar
[00:17:05.404 --> 00:17:05.604]  I don't
[00:17:23.891 --> 00:17:28.594]  And if they have to move one group out and get one group in, you think they're going to have some type of conflict with that?
[00:17:28.894 --> 00:17:29.794]  Yeah, of course they are.
[00:17:29.875 --> 00:17:33.437]  So it's a very bad decision, but I'm glad to see that they have overturned that.
[00:17:33.697 --> 00:17:44.243]  Because regardless of what you think about these political people, it doesn't matter if you like Trump or Hillary or Bernie or Gary Johnson or none of them, these guys have their right to assemble peacefully.
[00:17:44.843 --> 00:17:48.025]  If their protesters come out there and start lighting stuff on fire, yeah, they get arrested.
[00:17:48.065 --> 00:17:52.528]  But the individuals themselves have the right to do their political speech peacefully.
[00:17:53.268 --> 00:18:01.311]  And finally tonight, we saw Trump come out a couple days ago and he says, you know, we need a plan to get Bernie supporters on our side so we can Trump Hillary.
[00:18:01.351 --> 00:18:05.733]  And now Bernie is saying he's probably going to back Mrs. Clinton.
[00:18:05.753 --> 00:18:07.734]  I'm sure he's not exactly happy about that.
[00:18:08.174 --> 00:18:12.916]  But he said, in all likelihood, it will be Hillary Clinton when he was asked who he would support.
[00:18:12.936 --> 00:18:21.580]  He says, my job right now as a candidate is to fight to make sure that the Democratic Party is not only the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party,
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.522]  But that the platform is actually implemented by elected officials.
[00:18:26.682 --> 00:18:30.884]  And there's a lot of questionable activity, especially when it comes to Bernie Sanders.
[00:18:30.924 --> 00:18:34.766]  Maybe he was getting the raw deal, but seems like he's going to toe that party line regardless.
[00:18:35.026 --> 00:18:36.127]  Well, that's it for this segment.
[00:18:36.167 --> 00:18:38.528]  We'll be back right after this with more special reports.
[00:18:44.815 --> 00:18:45.856]  I'm running for president.
[00:18:46.236 --> 00:18:49.438]  Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.
[00:18:49.458 --> 00:18:54.301]  I'm hitting the road to earn your vote, and I hope you'll join me on this journey.
[00:19:04.907 --> 00:19:09.310]  There's a very important question that needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.451 --> 00:19:11.511]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.769 --> 00:19:15.769]  And to look at that threat, we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:27.192]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type one civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.852 --> 00:19:39.214]  You can say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.742 --> 00:19:50.145]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.345]  We're good to go.
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.386]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:31.934]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.418]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:46.732]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:47.934]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.454 --> 00:20:53.499]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription.
[00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:10.395]  Not just that chips are going to be on the pills and medicines themselves, but now you're going to have to give your blood, basically every time, a tiny prick, into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on in your body as well as your genes.
[00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.878]  In this short report we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.991]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:23.995]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Meet Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.934]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:04.097]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:17.542]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:19.763]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:21.424]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:30.126]  We do have that magic spark, but the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:46.631]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in BrainForce, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.

[00:23:03.604 --> 00:23:05.284]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:23:05.364 --> 00:23:10.526]  I'm your host, Rob Dew, sitting in our brand new revamped studio over here where the original Nightly News used to take place.
[00:23:11.646 --> 00:23:22.749]  Now, my next guest joining me, you may have seen him, if you watched our Bilderberg coverage, sticking his mic in the face of many globalists as they were trying to walk around and enjoy their day in Dresden, Germany.
[00:23:23.089 --> 00:23:32.871]  His name's Tilman Knechtl, and we're going to get his opinion on what happened yesterday in Germany at the shooting in Warenheim, and also talk about what's going on with Brexit, because as you know,
[00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:41.613]  Germany and Britain were basically the two pillars holding up the EU, and now that they have voted to leave, what is going to be the future of the European Union?
[00:23:41.653 --> 00:23:42.633]  Tillman, how's it going today?
[00:23:43.713 --> 00:23:44.294]  Oh, very good.
[00:23:44.674 --> 00:23:45.014]  Thank you.
[00:23:45.494 --> 00:23:45.854]  Excellent.
[00:23:45.894 --> 00:23:46.654]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:23:47.034 --> 00:23:51.695]  So, what has been the reaction in Germany to Britain voting to leave the EU?
[00:23:53.116 --> 00:23:59.077]  Well, we have reactions now from the Minister of the Economy, who said, like, now
[00:23:59.867 --> 00:24:02.488]  The threat of war is rising in Germany.
[00:24:02.909 --> 00:24:05.330]  Like, they really bring this now into the discussion.
[00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:07.191]  Like, there's gonna be new war.
[00:24:07.631 --> 00:24:08.772]  So they always say this.
[00:24:08.812 --> 00:24:11.753]  They held this threat up for like 10 years.
[00:24:11.833 --> 00:24:17.056]  They said, oh no, if there's like smaller states, they will all go to war with each other.
[00:24:17.076 --> 00:24:20.838]  And because they wanted obviously to centralize,
[00:24:21.982 --> 00:24:24.603]  The European Union and making this big super state.
[00:24:24.963 --> 00:24:29.224]  So there's obviously no danger from small states attacking other countries.
[00:24:29.324 --> 00:24:32.324]  I mean, when did you see Monaco attack somebody?
[00:24:32.364 --> 00:24:35.185]  And when did you see Switzerland attack somebody?
[00:24:35.465 --> 00:24:37.625]  So this is obviously just fear mongering.
[00:24:37.945 --> 00:24:41.326]  And we had the German Green Party member, Rebecca Harms.
[00:24:41.746 --> 00:24:45.747]  She said she was about to cry because she will miss the British Parliament members.
[00:24:46.337 --> 00:24:49.781]  And she called the British Parliament members and they were actually crying.
[00:24:50.421 --> 00:24:55.827]  And yeah, I would also be crying if I get paid like 100,000 a month for basically doing nothing.
[00:24:56.427 --> 00:25:03.354]  So yeah, they create all this panic and say, you know, the bureaucratic effort is now so high to get out of this.
[00:25:03.754 --> 00:25:09.060]  But obviously, it was the EU that implemented all these laws to England and Britain.
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:17.971]  So it's obviously the EU's fault that they have all these laws and they have now this bureaucratic effort to get out of there.
[00:25:18.795 --> 00:25:23.957]  And now they blame it on the Brexit voters that they made it so difficult to get out of there.
[00:25:23.977 --> 00:25:31.881]  But if they hadn't started in the first place, all these laws and all these EU regulations, there would be no problem with it.
[00:25:31.901 --> 00:25:33.722]  So it's obviously the EU's fault.
[00:25:34.182 --> 00:25:35.283]  So it's really ridiculous.
[00:25:35.343 --> 00:25:37.304]  And it's like all over the world.
[00:25:37.604 --> 00:25:40.425]  I mean, mainstream media is bought and paid for by the EU.
[00:25:40.885 --> 00:25:44.507]  So they obviously report negatively about the vote now.
[00:25:45.382 --> 00:25:54.831]  Yeah, they're taking the initial reports of gold going up and the pound going down and stocks going down in some areas and just saying, no, this is it.
[00:25:54.851 --> 00:25:56.212]  This Armageddon is happening.
[00:25:56.252 --> 00:25:56.712]  This is it.
[00:25:56.732 --> 00:26:02.558]  People voted essentially to break up the EU with Britain leaving, but I think that's
[00:26:03.098 --> 00:26:03.938]  All a bunch of hot air.
[00:26:03.998 --> 00:26:11.781]  They said the same thing in Iceland when they voted to basically go after the bankers and make the bankers accountable for destroying their economy.
[00:26:11.801 --> 00:26:12.361]  And what happened?
[00:26:12.621 --> 00:26:15.202]  Within six months, they turned their economy around.
[00:26:15.242 --> 00:26:16.502]  They were back in the surplus.
[00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:18.003]  They put bankers in jail.
[00:26:18.603 --> 00:26:23.784]  And now they're one of the most, one of the more prosperous countries in the European area.
[00:26:24.145 --> 00:26:30.306]  And there's nobody saying that Europeans can't have trade and culture and work together on things.
[00:26:30.586 --> 00:26:31.467]  But when you create a
[00:26:32.227 --> 00:26:37.589]  A dictatorial government inside with control over all these nations, what do you expect is going to happen?
[00:26:37.609 --> 00:26:42.511]  Eventually people are going to get angry and decide to leave.
[00:26:42.911 --> 00:26:50.294]  Now let's get to that German shooting that took place in Wernheim, which is just in the region of Frankfurt, Germany.
[00:26:50.534 --> 00:26:56.956]  A masked man went into a theater, I guess he started opening fire, but nobody was killed except for the gunman.
[00:26:57.256 --> 00:27:01.538]  Now, tell me, what have you learned just doing your research in the last day or so on this event?
[00:27:03.069 --> 00:27:13.035]  Yeah I mean I have no 100% proof but this looked highly suspicious to me because in Germany we have a long history of these lone gunmen killing people and then being dead.
[00:27:13.115 --> 00:27:22.961]  We had like 2003 a school shooting, Robert Steinhäuser shoots 16 people including himself and then more than 40 witnesses speak of two gunmen but the police
[00:27:22.961 --> 00:27:23.361]  We're good to go.
[00:27:46.571 --> 00:27:52.977]  It's a lot of contradictions, no motive for the killer, the media doesn't report about it, and the killer is dead again.
[00:27:53.277 --> 00:27:58.081]  Then we have the National Socialist Underground, that was a so-called Nazi terrorist organization.
[00:27:58.682 --> 00:28:04.547]  They were killed and they said they killed themselves when they saw the police arriving, which made no sense.
[00:28:04.967 --> 00:28:12.854]  And then it came out there was a German intelligence service member close to the attacks where these National Underground killers were.
[00:28:13.394 --> 00:28:18.236]  So in six of the nine murders, there was an agent for the German intelligence.
[00:28:18.536 --> 00:28:19.756]  So all these contradictions.
[00:28:19.876 --> 00:28:22.097]  And in the end, the killer is always dead.
[00:28:22.377 --> 00:28:25.659]  So we have the same here, which is at least suspicious.
[00:28:26.059 --> 00:28:28.200]  And it is, of course, an indication.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.981]  So I did my research today and I called the cinema.
[00:28:32.401 --> 00:28:37.323]  I called the police and I called the office of the district attorney and I called the build site.
[00:28:40.353 --> 00:28:48.115]  So, no one really answered me, except of the Office of the District Attorney, but they didn't really want to answer my questions.
[00:28:49.375 --> 00:28:59.157]  So, I asked them about some events that weren't super suspicious, but at least noticeable, but they always said, no, we can't answer that and we can't answer that.
[00:28:59.197 --> 00:29:06.538]  But I guess I'll read you my questions, which I had, because there were a lot of things that seemed at least noticeable.
[00:29:07.304 --> 00:29:16.386]  So I ask, why did it take three hours to the first emergency call from the cinema manager at 2.41 until six?
[00:29:16.546 --> 00:29:20.426]  It took three hours till the police declared the area safe again.
[00:29:20.866 --> 00:29:22.647]  So that reminded me of Orlando.
[00:29:23.047 --> 00:29:24.667]  Like, why does it take three hours?
[00:29:24.787 --> 00:29:30.128]  I mean, were there some negotiations with the hostage and with the hostage taker?
[00:29:30.628 --> 00:29:32.288]  What happened in these three hours?
[00:29:32.748 --> 00:29:35.629]  Because obviously the police needs to be quick if it's like,
[00:29:36.289 --> 00:29:37.072]  A kidnapping?
[00:29:37.112 --> 00:29:38.676]  They need to be as quick as possible.
[00:29:39.525 --> 00:29:44.046]  Then I was interested, how did they localize the shooter in the cinema?
[00:29:44.467 --> 00:29:46.567]  So did they maybe see him through a window?
[00:29:46.787 --> 00:29:51.689]  And if so, shouldn't they have seen that he only has alarm weapons, which came out now?
[00:29:52.209 --> 00:29:53.729]  So it was just a question.
[00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:56.290]  I didn't say, oh, this has to be like that.
[00:29:56.990 --> 00:30:00.131]  If they saw him before, they should have maybe seen that he has alarm weapons.
[00:30:00.792 --> 00:30:03.573]  So then, very important question I asked.
[00:30:04.233 --> 00:30:07.954]  And there was a report of the biggest German newspaper called the Bildzeitung.
[00:30:08.414 --> 00:30:09.154]  We're good to go.
[00:30:29.262 --> 00:30:35.131]  The chance is there if he's half Italian, but it's more sure that he speaks perfect German.
[00:30:35.211 --> 00:30:37.394]  And why is he speaking broken German?
[00:30:38.095 --> 00:30:41.039]  And they never investigated that again.
[00:30:41.059 --> 00:30:43.483]  There was a witness who said he spoke broken German.
[00:30:44.167 --> 00:30:52.232]  Then there was another witness who said, I had to close the door for the kidnapper and he was aiming a gun at my head.
[00:30:52.812 --> 00:30:56.634]  And then the kidnapper told him to go up the elevator.
[00:30:57.235 --> 00:31:06.160]  So it's weird that the kidnapper says to somebody, leave me alone, go up the elevator, because obviously the hostage could flee and
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:07.260]  I don't know.
[00:31:23.493 --> 00:31:27.037]  So where are the negotiations and what was his purpose?
[00:31:27.857 --> 00:31:32.782]  And then he shot the alarm gun and hurt 25 people with it.
[00:31:33.303 --> 00:31:36.105]  And I had the question that I also didn't want to answer.
[00:31:36.686 --> 00:31:42.832]  Did he have something on that protected him from the pepper spray, from the tear gas in the alarm gun?
[00:31:43.312 --> 00:31:44.934]  So also no answers there.
[00:31:45.354 --> 00:31:47.616]  And of course the most important question,
[00:31:48.357 --> 00:31:49.958]  He only had an alarm gun.
[00:31:50.338 --> 00:31:52.600]  So was it really necessary to kill him?
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.342]  Of course, I mean, there's a lot of panic.
[00:31:55.982 --> 00:32:00.746]  But I mean, there are like dozens of policemen walking in there.
[00:32:01.046 --> 00:32:02.887]  They are protected from head to toe.
[00:32:03.407 --> 00:32:08.971]  So, I mean, if there is a shot fired, they will immediately see that it's just an alarm gun.
[00:32:09.531 --> 00:32:12.133]  And it's one guy against, I don't know, 20 people.
[00:32:13.594 --> 00:32:19.595]  And, you know, even if they shot them, the chances are very low that they kill him immediately.
[00:32:20.156 --> 00:32:22.096]  So was this really necessary?
[00:32:22.216 --> 00:32:24.277]  Of course, these were just questions I asked.
[00:32:24.777 --> 00:32:30.078]  And obviously, you know, they just gave out the official story and they didn't want to answer me.
[00:32:30.958 --> 00:32:33.319]  So, yeah, that was the most important question.
[00:32:33.359 --> 00:32:36.019]  But the story is still to unfold.
[00:32:36.059 --> 00:32:38.260]  So we get more information about this.
[00:32:39.113 --> 00:32:39.894]  That's right, Tillman.
[00:32:39.994 --> 00:32:43.956]  And other news outlets are reporting that he had harmless grenades, he had replica weapons.
[00:32:44.357 --> 00:32:46.438]  So this story really doesn't add up.
[00:32:46.718 --> 00:32:49.800]  We're out of time now, but rest assured, I know you're going to be on the case.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.782]  If anything else crops up, you're going to let us know.
[00:32:52.322 --> 00:32:56.545]  And we'll be right back after this short announcement from InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:32:56.565 --> 00:32:59.027]  This is Rob Drew reporting for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:33:02.369 --> 00:33:04.751]  A lot of people ask me, what is the most important
[00:33:06.286 --> 00:33:06.546]  I think?
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.

[00:34:29.474 --> 00:34:30.494]  Now it's finally here.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:10.592 --> 00:37:12.633]  This is going to be a day like July 4th.
[00:37:12.653 --> 00:37:16.114]  Remember, that was not when we won the Revolutionary War.
[00:37:16.154 --> 00:37:17.954]  That was not when we won our independence.
[00:37:18.774 --> 00:37:21.275]  That was when we declared our independence.
[00:37:21.335 --> 00:37:24.396]  Declared the right of self-government.
[00:37:25.276 --> 00:37:32.118]  Declared that we have inalienable rights, that we create these governments to secure, that a just government
[00:37:32.896 --> 00:37:45.006]  Governs to fulfill these rights, and when they are destructive of those rights, it's the right of the people to alter or abolish it and institute new forms of government.
[00:37:45.066 --> 00:37:49.750]  And that's what we're seeing happening now, the very beginning of that, happening in Britain.
[00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:51.572]  I never thought it would happen.
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:52.921]  I never thought it would happen.
[00:37:52.941 --> 00:37:53.822]  I thought it was going to be rigged.
[00:37:54.403 --> 00:37:56.645]  And of course, Paul Joseph Watson did as well.
[00:37:56.786 --> 00:38:00.069]  I was watching his tweets and things he was putting up in articles.
[00:38:00.149 --> 00:38:01.070]  I was tweeting the same stuff.
[00:38:01.091 --> 00:38:03.113]  It's like, okay, they're ahead right now.
[00:38:03.233 --> 00:38:04.314]  Now they've got Remain ahead.
[00:38:04.374 --> 00:38:05.736]  They're going to rig this election.
[00:38:06.317 --> 00:38:08.839]  It must have been a massive landslide.
[00:38:09.591 --> 00:38:13.012]  For them to only win it by four points, okay?
[00:38:13.452 --> 00:38:14.452]  That was a solid win.
[00:38:14.872 --> 00:38:15.552]  That was a solid win.
[00:38:15.572 --> 00:38:18.913]  They had 70-some-odd percent of the people turn out to vote.
[00:38:19.213 --> 00:38:23.414]  Watson is going to be here and give us some more details on that, but put that in perspective.
[00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:26.935]  We only have about 50% of the people vote in American elections.
[00:38:27.835 --> 00:38:30.056]  So that was a huge, huge turnout.
[00:38:31.007 --> 00:38:33.988]  Now, as the headlines look, one article that's really good.
[00:38:34.008 --> 00:38:36.868]  This was the day the British people defied their jailers.
[00:38:36.908 --> 00:38:38.329]  That's a Telegraph headline.
[00:38:38.549 --> 00:38:38.949]  Another one.
[00:38:39.269 --> 00:38:42.150]  Brexit, the world's most complex divorce, begins.
[00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:43.930]  And we're going to talk about all this stuff.
[00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:53.453]  But as I was looking at this, as I was celebrating this pushback against globalism, all I could think about was, the British are leaving.
[00:38:53.953 --> 00:38:55.213]  The British are leaving.
[00:38:55.713 --> 00:38:57.273]  That means I'm single again!
[00:38:57.293 --> 00:38:58.454]  Oh, me head!
[00:39:00.249 --> 00:39:01.790]  Yeah, baby.
[00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:03.231]  It's Brexit.
[00:39:03.251 --> 00:39:03.891]  This is great.
[00:39:04.471 --> 00:39:06.172]  It was so much fun watching this.
[00:39:06.192 --> 00:39:08.354]  Yeah, look at this parade.
[00:39:08.774 --> 00:39:12.676]  That is the opening of Austin Powers, if you recognize that music.
[00:39:13.356 --> 00:39:18.919]  And that's what we all felt like last night, watching Britain take back its freedom, take back its culture.
[00:39:18.939 --> 00:39:23.382]  Look, this is real multiculturalism, a free Europe.
[00:39:23.982 --> 00:39:32.529]  Where people pursue their own destiny, where they write their own laws, where they have their own culture, and it's not dictated and dumbed down to them.
[00:39:32.589 --> 00:39:40.414]  And when I just did the backflip into the Jaguar XKE that's covered with a Union Jack, I couldn't do that.
[00:39:40.775 --> 00:39:45.178]  But I had to get in the car and go for a ride with my wife last night, like one o'clock.
[00:39:45.318 --> 00:39:46.239]  It was just too exciting.
[00:39:46.587 --> 00:39:54.394]  We celebrate the 4th of July as a reminder of earning our independence from a tyrannical and oppressive government.
[00:39:54.594 --> 00:40:01.140]  Just a reminder to the Obama administration, there's plenty of room on the calendar for another holiday.
[00:40:10.822 --> 00:40:13.425]  It is Independence Day for Britain, as Boris Johnson said.
[00:40:13.445 --> 00:40:16.087]  I was looking at the Telegraph's Tim Stanley.
[00:40:16.147 --> 00:40:20.472]  His headline is, this is the day the British people defied their jailers.
[00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:25.837]  He said, the people defied the experts, and they went with their conscience.
[00:40:26.157 --> 00:40:30.762]  He said labor voters, most of all the Northeast, rebelled against a century of labor leadership.
[00:40:31.202 --> 00:40:34.426]  He says, I'm astonished, staggered, humbled.
[00:40:35.106 --> 00:40:41.629]  I should never have lost faith in my countrymen, those bold, brave, beautiful British voters.
[00:40:42.449 --> 00:40:42.989]  Good for you!
[00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:44.750]  You're leading the way in freedom.
[00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:50.653]  And you know, it was Winston Churchill who said in the history of English-speaking people, now we've written a new chapter, by the way.
[00:40:51.193 --> 00:40:52.253]  This is going to be a new chapter.
[00:40:52.293 --> 00:40:55.855]  This is going to continue in America.
[00:40:55.875 --> 00:40:58.556]  We're going to talk to Roger Stone about that, but this is a new chapter.
[00:40:58.576 --> 00:41:03.278]  And he said, when America got its independence from Britain, it was a liberating thing for Britain as well.
[00:41:04.389 --> 00:41:05.990]  It unleashed freedom in Britain.
[00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:09.492]  It gave power to the people, to the Parliament in Britain.
[00:41:09.953 --> 00:41:13.295]  And we're going to see this happening as the EU unravels.
[00:41:13.335 --> 00:41:15.956]  And you're going to see true multiculturalism.
[00:41:16.397 --> 00:41:27.324]  You're going to see the energy and the culture of the European people, which has been repressed and dumbed down, turned into this kind of politically correct grey mass.
[00:41:28.344 --> 00:41:34.327]  A lobotomized population who has been indoctrinated and controlled by a central government.
[00:41:34.347 --> 00:41:39.650]  You're going to see that explode and creativity and diversity, true creativity, true diversity.
[00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:41.411]  So let's go to Roger Stone.
[00:41:41.431 --> 00:41:45.593]  Of course, Roger Stone has worked for many pro-American political parties in Eastern Europe.
[00:41:46.173 --> 00:41:54.158]  And I want to talk to him about that, but we're going to talk about a victory, first of all, that has just happened in regards to our presidential election here.
[00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:54.698]  Welcome, Roger.
[00:41:55.697 --> 00:41:56.658]  David, great to be with you.
[00:42:18.123 --> 00:42:21.025]  Yeah, globalism has taken two enormous hits this year.
[00:42:21.606 --> 00:42:25.969]  First the rise of Donald J. Trump, and now the Brexit vote.
[00:42:26.409 --> 00:42:27.550]  Globalism is done.
[00:42:28.451 --> 00:42:34.415]  And the globalists are increasingly panicky about the prospects for the road ahead.
[00:42:34.975 --> 00:42:38.078]  I think this portends very good things about the American election.
[00:42:38.958 --> 00:42:43.803]  And I am very pleased with the developments in the Trump campaign.
[00:42:44.464 --> 00:42:52.371]  I believe they can now strategically get back on track, get back on offense, because when you're not on offense, you're losing votes.
[00:42:52.771 --> 00:42:53.572]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:42:53.893 --> 00:42:59.478]  And you know, when I looked at this, Roger, we saw this division in the UK over Brexit.
[00:42:59.898 --> 00:43:01.380]  You had the Labour leadership
[00:43:02.321 --> 00:43:04.402]  Really versus the labor voters.
[00:43:04.742 --> 00:43:07.744]  The labor voters had really gotten the shaft with globalism.
[00:43:08.104 --> 00:43:17.048]  And yet the labor leaders, the labor union leaders, as well as the labor party leaders, were supporting staying in this globalism that had cost their voters their jobs.
[00:43:17.108 --> 00:43:19.290]  And then we saw the Tory leadership divided as well.
[00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:27.854]  Here in America, we've got the Democrat leadership, like Hillary Clinton, who was pushing, say, keep this together, and yet it's their voters.
[00:43:28.174 --> 00:43:32.095]  They're blue-collar voters who are being hurt by this, just like we saw in England.
[00:43:32.175 --> 00:43:36.896]  And then we've got the GOP establishment, and the only person on the other side of that is Donald Trump.
[00:43:36.916 --> 00:43:48.158]  But it's big enough that he can stand there with the blue-collar voters, I think, and with the Republican voters who understand what's going on, the people that Bilderberg was so concerned about they called the precariat.
[00:43:48.458 --> 00:43:51.219]  I think they should be very concerned about that precariat.
[00:43:51.479 --> 00:43:57.300]  I think they should be very concerned about this, the people understanding how globalism has really screwed them over.
[00:43:58.456 --> 00:44:00.677]  Yeah, I think it's a very analogous situation.
[00:44:00.757 --> 00:44:05.519]  I mean, ironically, it's the Democratic Party and the Clintons who brought us NAFTA.
[00:44:06.199 --> 00:44:09.080]  Remember what it was that Ross Perot said about NAFTA?
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:13.161]  He said that that sucking sound you hear are the jobs leaving America.
[00:44:13.301 --> 00:44:13.461]  Yeah.
[00:44:13.481 --> 00:44:15.722]  Of course, he turned out to be exactly right.
[00:44:16.603 --> 00:44:26.066]  Once again, the leadership of the Democratic Party and some in the union movement supporting NAFTA
[00:44:26.536 --> 00:44:41.304]  Now I think a great recognition, particularly among the Bernie Sanders voters, that these large globalist trade deals, whether it's NAFTA or TPP, TPA, they're leaving the American economy behind.
[00:44:42.464 --> 00:44:44.625]  So it is a precursor.
[00:44:45.066 --> 00:44:48.908]  I really believe at the end of the day, Trump will be able to get almost a third
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.181]  Of the Sanders voters.
[00:44:51.601 --> 00:45:03.088]  Not his hard left voters, but those labor-oriented voters who both oppose the Iraq War and oppose these globalist trade deals.
[00:45:03.869 --> 00:45:10.914]  And who also opposed the establishment essentially controlling them, the corrupt establishment, because that was also a big part of it as well.
[00:45:11.495 --> 00:45:21.963]  People didn't like what was happening in Brussels and people don't like what the establishment of both parties are doing to them and that's a reaction that we see with the Sanders voters as well as with the Trump voters.
[00:45:21.983 --> 00:45:22.503]  So I agree with you.
[00:45:22.523 --> 00:45:25.485]  I think he's got a very strong case to make to both of them.
[00:45:25.926 --> 00:45:27.307]  The American people now
[00:45:29.036 --> 00:45:44.740]  In other words, I think voter dissatisfaction and voter suspicion has now spread beyond the institutions of government and the Congress and the political system to now include big media.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:50.562]  In other words, the voters know that CNN is in bed with the political establishment.
[00:45:51.477 --> 00:45:59.282]  They know that CNN is only going to publicize information beneficial to the Clintons.
[00:45:59.903 --> 00:46:03.405]  That's why we sometimes jokingly call it the Clinton News Network.
[00:46:03.745 --> 00:46:11.651]  That's right, and of course that narrative of talking about how Brexit was xenophobic and racist, they didn't buy that either.
[00:46:12.151 --> 00:46:27.320]  I talked about how the Labour Party was divided, the membership from the voters, from the leadership, and how the Tories were divided, but the media in Britain was all together on that racist, xenophobe narrative.
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:36.105]  The people can get their information outside of mainstream media now, and the truth will out on this, and it did in the Brexit vote.
[00:46:41.264 --> 00:46:43.206]  We're good to go.

[00:47:07.602 --> 00:47:09.783]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.903 --> 00:47:16.706]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:16.946 --> 00:47:20.207]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.227 --> 00:47:21.408]  You're going to crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.991]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:47:47.031 --> 00:47:53.016]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.

[00:47:55.759 --> 00:47:56.920]  And we thank you for your support.
[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:35.299 --> 00:48:37.600]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.701]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:48:41.081 --> 00:48:46.583]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the InfoWar.
[00:48:47.023 --> 00:48:53.685]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.

[00:49:07.864 --> 00:49:11.226]  The New World Order is getting its butt kicked at high noon.
[00:49:11.506 --> 00:49:28.275]  Thankfully, the highly suspicious demise of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has, for the time being, not been a factor in the Supreme Court's decision on Obama's dangerously lawless immigration policy, as Obama pushes the country to the brink of anarchy.
[00:49:28.495 --> 00:49:36.680]  Of course, it didn't take long for the Obama administration to thumb its nose at the deadlocked judicial branch and the will of the American people.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:41.304]  Deferred action policy that has been in place for the last four years is not affected by this rule.
[00:49:42.444 --> 00:49:47.549]  Enforcement priorities developed by my administration are not affected by this ruling.
[00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:54.274]  This means that the people who might have benefited from the expanded deferred action policies
[00:49:55.168 --> 00:50:02.832]  Long term residents raising children who are Americans or legal residents, they will remain low priorities for enforcement.
[00:50:03.172 --> 00:50:11.796]  But like a castle made of sand, the fragile globalist secret world government has been dealt a strong blow by the waves of consciousness
[00:50:12.176 --> 00:50:15.978]  Inevitably, finding a way to the shore of a free world.
[00:50:16.218 --> 00:50:30.606]  Adon Salazar writes, Nigel Farage, the leader of the UK's Independence Party, which played a huge part in mobilizing UK citizens behind the Brexit, speculated the momentum behind the results could usher in a Trump presidency.
[00:50:30.826 --> 00:50:39.411]  With the Brexit debacle landing in the laps of the self-serving, arrogant Bilderberg scum, a propulsion of liberty is accelerating.
[00:50:39.711 --> 00:50:40.452]  We're good to go.
[00:50:56.733 --> 00:50:57.093]  We're good.
[00:51:11.901 --> 00:51:22.208]  These questions are all based on a ruinous stagnant counterfeit system devouring the sovereignty of nations that must be finally recognized and dismantled.
[00:51:22.328 --> 00:51:34.436]  Presidential candidate Donald Trump congratulated the UK for voting to assert its independence from the EU and encouraged the American people in November to also assert their independence from the global elite.
[00:51:34.696 --> 00:51:40.759]  You know, I said this was going to happen, and I think that it's a great thing, and we will see, but I think it's going to be a great thing.
[00:51:40.779 --> 00:51:43.139]  Did he say he had a right to resign?
[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:45.621]  Basically, they took back their country.
[00:51:45.661 --> 00:51:46.541]  That's a great thing.
[00:51:46.701 --> 00:51:53.924]  Following the British vote to exit the EU, Trump said the election results marked a shift toward more nationalistic tendencies.
[00:51:54.164 --> 00:52:00.970]  The Trump campaign said in a statement, Come November, the American people will have the chance to redeclare their independence.
[00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:08.297]  Americans will have a chance to vote for trade, immigration, and foreign policies that put our citizens first.
[00:52:08.557 --> 00:52:13.762]  They will have the chance to reject today's rule by the global elite and to embrace real change.
[00:52:14.122 --> 00:52:14.482]  We're good.
[00:52:30.618 --> 00:52:44.267]  came directly out of discussions held at the secretive Bilderberg group conference in 1955 at which European politicians considered the necessity to bring German people into a common European market as quickly as possible.
[00:52:44.488 --> 00:52:51.332]  The lunacy of the global elite can't survive once their dark secrets are completely exposed.
[00:52:51.652 --> 00:52:59.538]  Thomas Jefferson once said, nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal and nothing on earth
[00:52:59.878 --> 00:53:02.908]  can help the man with the wrong mental attitude.
[00:53:03.329 --> 00:53:05.596]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:53:17.859 --> 00:53:21.400]  David Knight on this day that Britain has declared its independence through Brexit.
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:30.082]  Joining us now to talk about the implications is Dr. Steve Pchenik, no stranger to InfoWars listeners, but let me remind you of his qualifications.
[00:53:30.122 --> 00:53:40.445]  An MD, a PhD in American psychiatry, former State Department official, author, publisher, critically acclaimed author, along with Tom Clancy of the paperback series.
[00:53:41.185 --> 00:53:45.046]  Dr. Steve Pchenik, and you'll find him at StevePchenik.com.
[00:53:45.086 --> 00:53:46.046]  Welcome, Dr. Pchenik.
[00:53:47.031 --> 00:53:49.453]  Thank you for bringing me on the show, Paul.
[00:53:50.174 --> 00:54:00.303]  I really wanted to come on the show just to give a little perspective from my point of view and to say to our audience, a wonderful audience, and to you and Alex,
[00:54:01.133 --> 00:54:05.634]  That this was coming about for quite a long time.
[00:54:05.874 --> 00:54:09.695]  First of all, I've been writing about this for about 20 years.
[00:54:09.975 --> 00:54:20.958]  In one of the Op Center series, I wrote about the devolution of the EU and the necessity for the EU to devolve into entities, not necessarily nation-states.
[00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:30.233]  Then in my book one and book two of Steve Talks, I insisted that Brexit be the beginning of the end of the EU.
[00:54:30.313 --> 00:54:33.234]  Now let me explain if I don't think anybody else has explained.
[00:54:33.795 --> 00:54:50.701]  The EU was created at the time when I was in France in 88 on a mission, was created between France and Germany as an attempt to stop Germany from coming into power again or allowing it to become a martial force.
[00:54:51.341 --> 00:55:00.864]  This was a total ethereal concept concocted by a few French socialists and sociology, none of which had any bearing on reality.
[00:55:01.444 --> 00:55:10.446]  What France was afraid of, and it has always been afraid of, is that France has lost wars since the time of Napoleon Bonaparte, who, by the way, was Corsican.
[00:55:11.047 --> 00:55:19.709]  But because of World War I and World War II, France decided that it needed to co-opt Germany into a concept called the European market.
[00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:23.575]  The whole aspect of it was fallacious.
[00:55:23.695 --> 00:55:29.683]  It had one currency, it had no military, no intelligence, no force behind it.
[00:55:29.703 --> 00:55:30.064]  It had...
[00:55:31.118 --> 00:55:40.864]  France, not as the central power, but Germany became the central power, and the Frankfurt Bank of Germany was actually the most powerful element in all of the EU.
[00:55:40.924 --> 00:55:50.470]  So for the past 10 to 15 years, as much as France would like to think that they co-opted Germany, Germany in fact became the dominant power, paradoxically.
[00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:58.955]  As a result, they lent out a lot of money and credits to Spain, Italy, and Portugal, who in turn defaulted on all their loans.
[00:55:59.515 --> 00:56:03.098]  So what does this mean for the Alex Jones Show and for us in general?
[00:56:03.258 --> 00:56:09.864]  For America, quite frankly, at the bottom line, it's extremely good what happened in the EU.
[00:56:10.444 --> 00:56:28.839]  The reason for that is that flight capital and certain immigrants will start to come to the United States because in this world of uncertainty and disorder, the one country that maintains its political, economic, and military stability is the Republic of the United States.
[00:56:29.548 --> 00:56:42.627]  What in fact will happen to the rest of Europe is that nationalism will arise and eventually we will see Catalonia or Barcelona break away from Spain, which is already a corrupt country.
[00:56:42.647 --> 00:56:45.712]  It was not really a country itself, it was created
[00:56:46.272 --> 00:56:56.621]  By a French king who, in fact, coagulated the Basque in Valencia and Madrid and the Catalan provinces.
[00:56:57.242 --> 00:56:58.162]  That will break up.
[00:56:58.383 --> 00:57:08.671]  Part of France will overthrow, probably, Hollande, the president who's a socialist, because they have a major unemployment problem and they're now in riot mode.
[00:57:09.112 --> 00:57:13.696]  The immigration problem that came in from Syria as a result of Putin's
[00:57:14.552 --> 00:57:26.282]  Uh, punishment to the West for our taking down the Soviet Union has now made it more imperative for the European countries to make sure that they don't have what's called a Schengen Agreement.
[00:57:26.422 --> 00:57:33.829]  In other words, they will refuse to accept immigrants and they will refuse to accept other Europeans to come through their own country.
[00:57:34.509 --> 00:57:40.951]  From our point of view, unfortunately, as a republic, we did not anticipate this on the formal level.
[00:57:41.071 --> 00:57:55.435]  Although some of us who wrote and were part of the Alex Jones and the Alex Jones Nation and the Infowar Nation, we could see it coming very quickly and actually insisted on it because it had a strong bearing on what we do here in America.
[00:57:55.835 --> 00:57:56.555]  And what do I mean?
[00:57:57.253 --> 00:58:20.614]  For many reasons, and we've talked about this for over 14 years, the stand down on the false flags that were created by Bush, Cheney, and eventually the Clintons were involved, and now Obama, was really part of not only taking away our guns, but more importantly, reinstituting the federal government as a major source of power over the states and the governors.
[00:58:21.346 --> 00:58:43.004]  I had warned the federal government repeatedly, at expense to myself and others, as has Alex, and as has many people at the Infowar Nation, that the federal government can no longer sustain its legitimacy if it continues to produce these false flags like Orlando, Sandy Hook, and the various other elements we were talking about.
[00:58:43.505 --> 00:58:47.088]  The President of the United States is not qualified to be the President.
[00:58:47.742 --> 00:58:49.004]  Well, that's it for our show tonight.
