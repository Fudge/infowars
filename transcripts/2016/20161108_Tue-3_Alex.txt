[00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:07.938]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:16.028]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[00:00:16.288 --> 00:00:18.390]  As president, I will make it clear.
[00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:23.994]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:29.938]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[00:00:29.998 --> 00:00:33.100]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.362]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:38.964]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:00:41.357 --> 00:00:43.339]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.984]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[00:00:47.424 --> 00:00:55.314]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[00:00:57.222 --> 00:00:57.682]  The U.S.
[00:00:57.742 --> 00:01:01.344]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[00:01:01.704 --> 00:01:09.329]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:12.050]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.172]  Of course not, because she's... Look, there's a really loud noise.
[00:01:16.712 --> 00:01:20.775]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[00:01:20.815 --> 00:01:23.016]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[00:01:26.803 --> 00:01:31.268]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:02:00.916 --> 00:02:02.957]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:02:03.197 --> 00:02:04.518]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[00:02:04.778 --> 00:02:08.299]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:16.403]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:21.406]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:02:21.566 --> 00:02:22.306]  The reality is
[00:02:22.586 --> 00:02:27.052]  It's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[00:02:27.392 --> 00:02:34.941]  Secret 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[00:02:35.181 --> 00:02:39.607]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:02:39.867 --> 00:02:45.633]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes.
[00:02:45.753 --> 00:02:48.716]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[00:02:48.916 --> 00:02:52.200]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.143]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:02:56.364 --> 00:02:57.965]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:01.657 --> 00:03:05.099]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.564]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:03:13.165 --> 00:03:21.570]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:25.873]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:03:26.214 --> 00:03:31.357]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics, the destroyer of our towns,
[00:03:31.797 --> 00:03:35.620]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.103]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[00:03:39.443 --> 00:03:50.531]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:53.273]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[00:03:53.493 --> 00:03:59.458]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at Infowarslife.com with AnthroPlex.
[00:04:09.855 --> 00:04:17.771]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[00:04:17.851 --> 00:04:20.937]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[00:04:21.735 --> 00:04:23.596]  And they're also very affordable.
[00:04:45.723 --> 00:04:52.467]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the InfoWar change the country and the world.
[00:04:52.867 --> 00:04:53.628]  It's a win-win.
[00:04:54.108 --> 00:04:59.811]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:05:00.172 --> 00:05:01.192]  Brain Force is here.
[00:05:01.713 --> 00:05:03.994]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:05:04.254 --> 00:05:12.079]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.992]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:05:16.292 --> 00:05:16.433]  Right?
[00:05:16.453 --> 00:05:18.794]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:05:19.154 --> 00:05:22.657]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:05:22.717 --> 00:05:25.859]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.163]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:05:31.703 --> 00:05:33.525]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:05:33.885 --> 00:05:38.308]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:05:38.468 --> 00:05:40.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.571]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:05:42.711 --> 00:05:42.951]  Exactly.
[00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:46.756]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:05:47.277 --> 00:05:54.566]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:05:54.826 --> 00:05:55.266]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[00:06:00.186 --> 00:06:02.827]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[00:06:03.067 --> 00:06:06.128]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[00:06:06.488 --> 00:06:07.208]  Because it's already here.
[00:06:07.588 --> 00:06:08.268]  It's being announced.
[00:06:08.608 --> 00:06:12.089]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:14.450]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.110]  A new battleship in the fight.
[00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.291]  InfoWars Live.
[00:06:17.471 --> 00:06:18.291]  Available right now.
[00:06:18.571 --> 00:06:20.352]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[00:06:20.372 --> 00:06:22.752]  You gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[00:06:23.472 --> 00:06:24.373]  Or you gonna be part of history?
[00:06:24.933 --> 00:06:27.914]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[00:06:28.434 --> 00:06:29.014]  Take action!
[00:06:31.167 --> 00:06:43.295]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is 10.39 Central Standard Time, 11.39 Eastern, 9.39 Mountain Time, Montana Time, and of course, 8.39 Pacific Time.
[00:06:43.356 --> 00:06:47.158]  Roger Stone works at four administrations, one of all the nine campaigns.
[00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:48.259]  He's here tonight.
[00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:53.242]  DrudgeReport.com, the people's news site of the world.
[00:06:53.643 --> 00:06:54.903]  Bigger than the New York Times.
[00:06:55.284 --> 00:06:57.205]  And don't just say that to kiss Drudge's ass.
[00:06:57.225 --> 00:06:58.066]  We need to celebrate.
[00:06:58.686 --> 00:07:02.171]  Better than the New York Times and all of Facebook combined.
[00:07:02.552 --> 00:07:03.173]  They hate that.
[00:07:03.433 --> 00:07:04.174]  Run by one man.
[00:07:05.242 --> 00:07:08.864]  Is saying Trump is projected to win in the next 30 minutes.
[00:07:08.904 --> 00:07:10.425]  Now, they could flip numbers.
[00:07:10.465 --> 00:07:11.165]  They could do anything.
[00:07:11.185 --> 00:07:12.066]  They could launch a war.
[00:07:12.306 --> 00:07:13.427]  They could launch a false flag.
[00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:14.867]  They have committed so many crimes.
[00:07:14.907 --> 00:07:15.728]  They're so committed.
[00:07:16.308 --> 00:07:17.269]  They could do anything.
[00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:18.429]  They've told you he's going to lose.
[00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:22.272]  But Trump, on the verge of presidency, world in shock.
[00:07:22.312 --> 00:07:24.653]  And I looked during the break in my office.
[00:07:24.733 --> 00:07:25.613]  I have three TVs.
[00:07:26.174 --> 00:07:26.754]  I have Fox.
[00:07:26.794 --> 00:07:27.495]  I have CNN.
[00:07:27.515 --> 00:07:28.375]  I have CNBC.
[00:07:28.435 --> 00:07:29.736]  I don't even watch MSNBC.
[00:07:29.796 --> 00:07:31.457]  I have MSNBC out here on this one.
[00:07:32.057 --> 00:07:34.580]  And they all look like deer in the headlights.
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.761]  They are stunned.
[00:07:35.821 --> 00:07:40.006]  They threw everything they had at Donald Trump.
[00:07:40.807 --> 00:07:47.194]  And we look at the electoral map at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and DrugsReport.com and it appears
[00:07:48.424 --> 00:07:56.391]  That unless they claim every other state that hasn't been announced yet, 4 or 5, to him, which is BS, he will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:07:56.431 --> 00:08:01.436]  And tomorrow, Roger Stone will be here, if there is this big victory, to break down, because we can't sit on our laurels.
[00:08:01.456 --> 00:08:02.997]  They're going to counter offensive.
[00:08:03.317 --> 00:08:04.539]  The empire's going to strike back.
[00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:06.060]  But I gotta shake your hand.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.861]  What a strong showing regardless.
[00:08:08.602 --> 00:08:12.246]  I saw him claiming he was going to lose all the media and got disheartened because I know the polls showed him winning.
[00:08:12.266 --> 00:08:13.988]  But I guess that was just their con game.
[00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:17.612]  And I got to be honest, I guess I started smoking the dope, the propaganda.
[00:08:17.632 --> 00:08:18.773]  I didn't say he was going to lose.
[00:08:19.414 --> 00:08:23.098]  We're not out of the woods yet, but Roger Stone, there's a lot of celebration happening here and all over the world.
[00:08:23.438 --> 00:08:24.560]  You just talked to Trump Tower.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.402]  The victory speech is being prepared.
[00:08:26.422 --> 00:08:26.942]  It's not yet.
[00:08:27.022 --> 00:08:27.603]  Give us the big...
[00:08:29.845 --> 00:08:39.157]  The folks in the Trump campaign are now satisfied that they have seen enough numbers from the outstanding states to declare victory.
[00:08:39.177 --> 00:08:46.546]  The croppers tonight, the real surprise is Wisconsin, Michigan never considered to be
[00:08:47.527 --> 00:09:03.722]  Uh, in the in the Trump orbit until late when Steve Bannon made a strategic decision seeing rising poll numbers in those states to make a major play for both states going after white, blue collar Catholic Democrats.
[00:09:04.463 --> 00:09:10.306]  Who are patriots, who are sick of these trade deals that have destroyed this country's job market.
[00:09:10.506 --> 00:09:14.167]  That will be the hidden story of tonight.
[00:09:14.407 --> 00:09:21.770]  Trade and those union members, I think, are the ones who will, in the end, put Donald Trump over the top.
[00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:26.032]  So it's Reagan Democrats that now realize globalism is an F-job.
[00:09:26.853 --> 00:09:27.413]  Exactly.
[00:09:27.573 --> 00:09:30.234]  It is the Bernie supporters, in the end.
[00:09:30.314 --> 00:09:31.915]  These are the folks who supported Bernie.
[00:09:32.855 --> 00:09:36.497]  You said, be nice to them because they're going to steal it from him and we need them to understand.
[00:09:36.538 --> 00:09:36.978]  You were right.
[00:09:37.058 --> 00:09:40.460]  This will be a day long remembered if this happens.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:56.770]  This will be, in the words of the Economist, in the words of the Washington Post, in the words of the Financial Times and every other CFR publication, if Hillary fell after Brexit and Russia pulling out, this will be a devastating event to their operations.
[00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.132]  This is a watershed moment in American politics.
[00:10:00.172 --> 00:10:12.602]  This is the end of the two-party duopoly, and the elites who have run the country... My friend, I would get tears in my eyes, but once a year when I had some mom on who had her kids taken by CPS because she was a Patriot or something, I would get a tear in my eye seeing the kid they took.
[00:10:12.962 --> 00:10:14.524]  Or some kid that died in CPS or something.
[00:10:14.584 --> 00:10:15.845]  I would cry maybe once a year for a kid.
[00:10:16.485 --> 00:10:18.667]  Lately, the energy's been so high, I'm not even crying.
[00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:28.214]  I, like, think of America and the Supreme Court justices they're gonna put in, and the globalism, and the attack on the family, and the wars they want, and just my very spirit.
[00:10:29.215 --> 00:10:31.436]  It's not like I get tears in my eyes because I'm crying.
[00:10:31.537 --> 00:10:32.818]  I want to kick some ass.
[00:10:33.198 --> 00:10:36.921]  And I think that spirit, your spirit, what I was feeling, everybody else was feeling,
[00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:40.323]  And I think the establishment realizes he was winning.
[00:10:40.583 --> 00:10:42.525]  They were getting ready to steal it with the vote machines.
[00:10:42.985 --> 00:10:47.188]  I think so far, they may still try it, they backed off realizing we're not buying it.
[00:10:47.468 --> 00:10:50.230]  Trump, just like he did in the primary, they stole it from Sanders.
[00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:52.632]  He said, no, I got double the people.
[00:10:52.892 --> 00:10:54.073]  You're not taking it from me.
[00:10:54.313 --> 00:10:57.615]  That's what we want as a president, is a junkyard dog.
[00:10:58.076 --> 00:10:59.777]  Yeah, he's a brawler and they know that.
[00:10:59.837 --> 00:11:01.959]  But I also think they looked at the map.
[00:11:02.987 --> 00:11:05.568]  This had to be close in order for them to steal it.
[00:11:05.668 --> 00:11:07.729]  At least relatively close.
[00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:16.554]  With Trump carrying Wisconsin now, Iowa, North Carolina, and Michigan, and close in Washington State.
[00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:17.754]  Nobody saw that coming.
[00:11:17.815 --> 00:11:18.975]  He may yet reel that in.
[00:11:19.035 --> 00:11:19.735]  Here's my concern.
[00:11:20.896 --> 00:11:21.736]  Everybody's celebrating.
[00:11:21.776 --> 00:11:25.697]  The New York Times, who said he was 90% going to lose, now says 95% going to win.
[00:11:26.137 --> 00:11:27.117]  Everybody's running around celebrating.
[00:11:27.337 --> 00:11:28.958]  There's a bunch of states not closed yet.
[00:11:28.978 --> 00:11:30.318]  And look, put it up.
[00:11:30.418 --> 00:11:31.758]  See, I got a bad feeling.
[00:11:31.998 --> 00:11:32.578]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:11:32.738 --> 00:11:33.339]  God help me.
[00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:34.199]  Please, I don't want to be wrong.
[00:11:34.579 --> 00:11:35.359]  So bad on this.
[00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:41.100]  We've got Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Wisconsin, you know, and Michigan.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.200]  They're still calling pink.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.081]  Obviously, Georgia and Michigan are going for him.
[00:11:44.981 --> 00:11:50.285]  And so, that's my, she's only 7 points supposedly out right now.
[00:11:51.046 --> 00:11:52.327]  Why is everyone celebrating?
[00:11:52.407 --> 00:11:55.049]  Why is the New York Times saying 95% victory?
[00:11:55.109 --> 00:11:55.950]  Let me put that on screen.
[00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.891]  I mean, I'm not the political like you explain to me.
[00:11:57.911 --> 00:12:00.854]  Because every one of those states that are still out can be projected.
[00:12:01.094 --> 00:12:03.856]  And because the pros in the party have... Why do they got them pink?
[00:12:04.176 --> 00:12:05.398]  Well, because this is crap.
[00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:08.461]  Because no, that's the news media and they are more cautious.
[00:12:08.562 --> 00:12:17.833]  But the hard-bitten pals who crunch these numbers are looking at them over at the Republican National Committee, over at the Trump Tower, and they can see that this is over.
[00:12:18.394 --> 00:12:19.535]  So... I agree, but...
[00:12:21.627 --> 00:12:23.128]  My sixth sense has never been wrong.
[00:12:23.168 --> 00:12:25.509]  Maybe it's going to change because there's a battle going on right now.
[00:12:26.009 --> 00:12:28.170]  I've had incredible anxiety, incredible concern.
[00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:29.250]  I don't just go off like voodoo.
[00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:30.191]  I look at the numbers.
[00:12:30.271 --> 00:12:31.031]  I agree with you.
[00:12:31.111 --> 00:12:32.291]  He's winning in all the polls.
[00:12:32.531 --> 00:12:33.032]  He should win.
[00:12:33.052 --> 00:12:33.712]  That's what I've been saying.
[00:12:34.232 --> 00:12:39.534]  But she's within seven points here of closing with how many points are left on the board?
[00:12:39.834 --> 00:12:45.877]  But I think they've seen enough of the early numbers to see the trend line again, the direction.
[00:12:46.337 --> 00:12:51.519]  And then secondarily, Trump gets to 270 before she does.
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.101]  He precludes her from getting there by getting there first.
[00:12:54.141 --> 00:12:56.102]  And you said earlier... And that will happen here shortly.
[00:12:56.162 --> 00:12:57.622]  Possession is 9 tenths of the law.
[00:12:58.003 --> 00:13:00.344]  Give us the big inside baseball you learned 10 minutes ago.
[00:13:00.464 --> 00:13:03.945]  Yeah, the key thing is Trump is in his apartment.
[00:13:04.686 --> 00:13:08.227]  He's gone up from to the top of the Trump Tower.
[00:13:08.668 --> 00:13:11.289]  He will now head over to the Hilton on 6th Avenue.
[00:13:11.989 --> 00:13:13.430]  And claim victory.
[00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:18.051]  This is very important if we're going to have a disputed election.
[00:13:18.111 --> 00:13:20.312]  I don't think, I think we're past that in all honesty.
[00:13:20.992 --> 00:13:25.154]  This is the most historic moment I have seen since Ronald Reagan beat Jimmy Carter.
[00:13:25.934 --> 00:13:31.216]  And Reagan was not as far behind Carter in the close.
[00:13:31.356 --> 00:13:34.037]  So Trump has closed a larger gap.
[00:13:34.057 --> 00:13:36.578]  The entire establishment having convulsions of hate.
[00:13:37.038 --> 00:13:39.178]  Everything against him, the rigging, the epicness.
[00:13:39.439 --> 00:13:40.759]  This is three times bigger than Reagan.
[00:13:40.979 --> 00:13:45.623]  But also, the party establishment did close ranks around Reagan.
[00:13:46.063 --> 00:13:47.825]  The price of that was George Bush.
[00:13:48.405 --> 00:13:50.767]  But once he got on the ticket, you had a united party.
[00:13:51.007 --> 00:13:51.788]  Let's be candid.
[00:13:52.088 --> 00:13:58.513]  Half the Republican Party walked out on Donald Trump, and it appears that he will win anyway, without them.
[00:13:58.893 --> 00:14:00.715]  John Kasich, call your office.
[00:14:00.735 --> 00:14:03.237]  This is a repudiation of the establishment Republican Party.
[00:14:04.045 --> 00:14:08.489]  There's no question, because Trump's nomination was the hostile takeover of the Republican Party.
[00:14:08.529 --> 00:14:13.452]  You are one of the top, they admit, demographic electoral college experts in the world.
[00:14:13.472 --> 00:14:21.679]  Let's put the New York Times map, which is their god, back on screen, and please convince me, I want to believe you, that we've got five or six states still not reporting final results.
[00:14:21.699 --> 00:14:22.580]  We've had projections.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.041]  Trump, New York Times.
[00:14:24.501 --> 00:14:25.202]  Let's scroll down, folks.
[00:14:25.222 --> 00:14:26.163]  I want to show people the New York Times.
[00:14:27.083 --> 00:14:29.566]  Ninety-seven percent, it was ninety-five, now it's ninety-seven.
[00:14:29.586 --> 00:14:30.086]  Let's scroll down.
[00:14:30.947 --> 00:14:31.628]  The crew had it over there.
[00:14:31.648 --> 00:14:32.849]  If you want to get them to show you, we'll do it.
[00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.171]  Ninety-five percent Trump win.
[00:14:36.633 --> 00:14:38.855]  Clinton is done.
[00:14:38.875 --> 00:14:46.342]  I mean, there's, again, they've gone from claiming ninety-five percent she was going to win to this on election day, flip-flopping.
[00:14:46.402 --> 00:14:49.786]  Is this not another repudiation, escoriation?
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.704]  Discrediting of this Carlos Slim operation?
[00:14:54.224 --> 00:14:57.508]  Trump is going to win with more than 300 electoral votes.
[00:14:57.568 --> 00:15:02.153]  If you go back up to the map, you can walk through this.
[00:15:03.094 --> 00:15:08.079]  Trump will win Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and New Hampshire.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.401]  In Georgia.
[00:15:09.781 --> 00:15:12.443]  That puts him over without Arizona.
[00:15:13.084 --> 00:15:14.445]  Utah is a... Take your time.
[00:15:14.485 --> 00:15:15.566]  Put it on each state slowly.
[00:15:15.586 --> 00:15:16.386]  Let's go to Minnesota.
[00:15:16.406 --> 00:15:17.267]  Let's go to Wisconsin.
[00:15:17.287 --> 00:15:17.907]  Let's go to Michigan.
[00:15:18.228 --> 00:15:19.048]  Let's show each one.
[00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:22.731]  Okay, we've got Donald Trump in first place in Michigan with 48.
[00:15:25.085 --> 00:15:25.485]  48 to 46, okay?
[00:15:25.525 --> 00:15:27.506]  She's going to win there.
[00:15:28.166 --> 00:15:29.367]  He's going to win there, pardon me.
[00:15:29.447 --> 00:15:30.407]  Okay, let's go to Wisconsin.
[00:15:30.567 --> 00:15:39.871]  Here is a surprise because I would argue that many in the Wisconsin machine of Scott Walker were working against Trump a solid victory.
[00:15:39.891 --> 00:15:41.091]  49 to 45, big victory.
[00:15:41.211 --> 00:15:41.772]  Very strong.
[00:15:41.792 --> 00:15:42.632]  Okay, let's go to the next state.
[00:15:43.032 --> 00:15:45.734]  Now you go to Minnesota, we give that to her.
[00:15:45.854 --> 00:15:47.835]  I don't think it was ever in the realm.
[00:15:48.075 --> 00:15:48.495]  Iowa.
[00:15:48.916 --> 00:15:57.721]  By the way, Trump's late trip to Minnesota, a total head fake by Steve Bannon, forcing them to move surrogates there, forcing them to move money there.
[00:15:57.921 --> 00:15:59.322]  It was a head fake.
[00:15:59.862 --> 00:16:01.363]  Iowa, big surprise.
[00:16:01.403 --> 00:16:03.404]  A statement Romney could never pop.
[00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:05.025]  41 to 42, Trump victory, devastation.
[00:16:05.185 --> 00:16:07.347]  A place where Barack Obama won by 14 points.
[00:16:07.987 --> 00:16:09.809]  Target maximum firepower.
[00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:10.189]  There you go.
[00:16:10.209 --> 00:16:11.050]  Let's go to the next one.
[00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:12.331]  Now, Georgia.
[00:16:12.832 --> 00:16:17.936]  It's amazing that the media has held this one out late and kept telling us it was competitive.
[00:16:17.976 --> 00:16:19.798]  That was about as competitive as Texas.
[00:16:19.858 --> 00:16:21.299]  Could we look at Texas for a moment?
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:21.960]  Let's do that.
[00:16:22.461 --> 00:16:23.602]  Yeah, how did that work out?
[00:16:24.122 --> 00:16:25.564]  Oh, she was going to win, Texas.
[00:16:25.724 --> 00:16:25.805]  52 to 44.
[00:16:25.905 --> 00:16:26.786]  Oops.
[00:16:27.387 --> 00:16:31.613]  So, Georgia is going to be solidly in the Trump camp.
[00:16:32.053 --> 00:16:33.716]  You're over 270 with those.
[00:16:33.756 --> 00:16:35.018]  There is no path for her.
[00:16:35.398 --> 00:16:38.523]  She could have Nevada and Pennsylvania and Minnesota.
[00:16:39.043 --> 00:16:39.825]  She still loses.
[00:16:41.738 --> 00:16:44.920]  Wow, so is there any path now on this battle map?
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:52.825]  Roger Stone to the globalist at George Soros, the Nazi collaborator, he can't make this up, reattaining his control of the U.S.
[00:16:52.865 --> 00:16:54.266]  after eight years of ruling us.
[00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:56.230]  I don't see it.
[00:16:56.891 --> 00:17:05.134]  This is, it's interesting, a few minutes ago I saw an earlier clip on TV where someone addressed Hillary Clinton as Madam President.
[00:17:05.575 --> 00:17:11.537]  This is like that famous 1948 moment where Harry Truman holds up the Chicago Tribune that says Dewey wins.
[00:17:11.677 --> 00:17:13.638]  Can we pull up Harry Truman, Dewey wins?
[00:17:14.419 --> 00:17:15.339]  That's where we are.
[00:17:15.499 --> 00:17:16.039]  That's where we are.
[00:17:16.059 --> 00:17:17.160]  Harry Truman, Dewey wins.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.340]  Let's pull that up.
[00:17:18.901 --> 00:17:19.281]  Exactly.
[00:17:19.481 --> 00:17:20.561]  What did you make yesterday?
[00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:21.802]  Because I saw that as a major omen.
[00:17:24.049 --> 00:17:30.662]  On the Monday show, All The Days Just Bleed Together, where she cancelled the fireworks victory display for 10 o'clock tonight.
[00:17:31.002 --> 00:17:32.605]  Yes, that's now been, that's now passed.
[00:17:32.866 --> 00:17:33.667]  Guess that didn't happen.
[00:17:34.195 --> 00:17:48.479]  No, look, I think when you saw the late movement of the Clinton family, Bill going into Florida, Chelsea going to New Hampshire, they were dropping back to states they should have had in the bank.
[00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:48.959]  I agree.
[00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:51.439]  Two days ago they started dropping to blue states.
[00:17:52.019 --> 00:17:58.321]  So that told you that they saw what we saw, that Trump had a head of steam and that this steamroller was coming.
[00:18:00.444 --> 00:18:02.866]  They still have control of the nuclear weapons.
[00:18:03.286 --> 00:18:08.831]  Obama's done bold things like openly funding radical jihadists worldwide to take over 25 countries.
[00:18:10.592 --> 00:18:20.960]  Let's not lie to ourselves in the next three months until the 18th and 19th inauguration, even though the military is aware of what's happening, it may stop it, that they're going to strike back.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.481]  These are cornered rats.
[00:18:22.541 --> 00:18:26.244]  So we can't just let her skate off into abstentia.
[00:18:26.945 --> 00:18:28.206]  So you didn't want to talk
[00:18:29.298 --> 00:18:29.858]  Trump victory.
[00:18:29.878 --> 00:18:32.499]  But it looks like we're 10 seconds from it.
[00:18:32.859 --> 00:18:33.699]  We're going to be here tonight.
[00:18:33.759 --> 00:18:35.200]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.140]  Send the link out to everybody, folks.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:41.802]  As another victory, I was learning we had 18 million viewers at the start of the show after yesterday.
[00:18:41.822 --> 00:18:44.242]  Now it's like 26 million or something a little while ago.
[00:18:44.623 --> 00:18:45.603]  That's that's terrible.
[00:18:45.623 --> 00:18:45.743]  OK.
[00:18:47.392 --> 00:18:49.875]  That's just click videos, not radio stations that we're on.
[00:18:50.015 --> 00:18:51.376]  It's more like 35 million.
[00:18:51.396 --> 00:18:53.117]  But, you know, that's pathetic.
[00:18:53.197 --> 00:18:55.179]  I mean, we have to be 10 times bigger than CNN.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.101]  So let's send the links out to everybody we know.
[00:18:57.421 --> 00:18:58.542]  Here's the real live coverage.
[00:18:58.582 --> 00:19:09.452]  Infowars.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.
[00:19:15.946 --> 00:19:17.207]  I want to talk some, Roger.
[00:19:17.227 --> 00:19:19.688]  And again, the fish isn't in the boat yet.
[00:19:19.749 --> 00:19:20.789]  It's up to the side of the boat.
[00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:23.451]  But think about it.
[00:19:23.471 --> 00:19:25.452]  We're going to talk to them to have you here.
[00:19:25.872 --> 00:19:27.993]  But I want to come back, make calls to Trump Tower, whatever.
[00:19:29.014 --> 00:19:31.015]  But I want to talk about how does the empire strike back?
[00:19:31.035 --> 00:19:33.337]  Because if we don't talk about that, we're obviously stupid.
[00:19:33.617 --> 00:19:34.597]  They're going to pull something big.
[00:19:34.617 --> 00:19:38.160]  They've got Soros, Black Lives Matter, the riot groups are going to try something, but separately.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.801]  You talked to them 30 minutes ago.
[00:19:39.821 --> 00:19:42.022]  They're getting ready to go over and make this announcement.
[00:19:42.562 --> 00:19:43.223]  They're still watching.
[00:19:43.303 --> 00:19:44.664]  When should we see the Trump announcement?
[00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:45.084]  In about an hour?
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.361]  Sir, you're in control of this.
[00:19:52.042 --> 00:19:58.927]  If you remember in the epic Bush-Gore recount, Gore's major mistake was not claiming victory.
[00:19:59.307 --> 00:20:01.309]  Bush and Jim Baker are screwing it up.
[00:20:01.329 --> 00:20:03.150]  Sure, start over, because I didn't have audio on his mic.
[00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:04.231]  What was he on the whole time?
[00:20:06.363 --> 00:20:06.803]  Start over.
[00:20:06.843 --> 00:20:07.604]  This is a big announcement.
[00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:08.965]  Roger Stone, we're live.
[00:20:08.985 --> 00:20:10.486]  I don't want to get this out because of whatever reason.
[00:20:10.506 --> 00:20:10.946]  Turn your mic off.
[00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:11.347]  Big deal.
[00:20:11.407 --> 00:20:12.788]  Everybody's been up for 40 hours.
[00:20:12.808 --> 00:20:14.209]  I paid for this mic, Mr. Brink.
[00:20:14.269 --> 00:20:14.889]  Oh, pardon me.
[00:20:15.329 --> 00:20:15.690]  Start over.
[00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:17.591]  So, how do they counter-strike?
[00:20:17.631 --> 00:20:20.753]  What do we have to look for now that clearly Trump's the winner?
[00:20:20.953 --> 00:20:26.818]  Look, at this point, I think Bill and Hillary Clinton will be using whatever political capital they have left
[00:20:27.338 --> 00:20:28.840]  To argue for pardons.
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.181]  So it's cover their ass time?
[00:20:30.682 --> 00:20:35.627]  I think so and they'll probably try to get a pardon for their co-conspirator daughter Chelsea while they're at it.
[00:20:36.227 --> 00:20:39.411]  Somewhere right now David Brock is blowing his brains out.
[00:20:40.192 --> 00:20:42.114]  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
[00:20:42.134 --> 00:20:44.136]  It is extraordinary that
[00:20:48.795 --> 00:20:55.841]  My greatest concern at this point, talk about comeback, is the security around Donald Trump must be airtight.
[00:20:56.341 --> 00:21:01.706]  Because he threatens the globalists now in a way like never before.
[00:21:02.206 --> 00:21:04.388]  And I pray for his personal safety.
[00:21:04.868 --> 00:21:06.650]  He is the man who can save this country.
[00:21:07.765 --> 00:21:11.606]  And Mike Pence, who has been absolutely the right guy.
[00:21:11.706 --> 00:21:14.046]  I tacitly support him because he has some good records on things.
[00:21:14.066 --> 00:21:14.967]  He seems like a patriot.
[00:21:15.387 --> 00:21:16.687]  Not perfect, but an honorable man.
[00:21:17.547 --> 00:21:19.008]  He's proved himself at spades.
[00:21:19.048 --> 00:21:19.808]  He's amazing.
[00:21:19.908 --> 00:21:33.791]  No, and look, I think Paul Manafort deserves enormous credit for this because he not only crushed the Ted Cruz revolution in the Rules Committee, but he also guided the Trump campaign and Donald to the right selection, which was Mike Pence.
[00:21:34.391 --> 00:21:36.153]  And I'm not just saying it because I think he's a great Republican.
[00:21:36.193 --> 00:21:36.433]  And I agree.
[00:21:36.473 --> 00:21:46.720]  I don't kiss Politico's ass, unless they're patriots, then Bannon comes in with just the street brawling populism that fitted with Trump, explosive.
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.982]  And an understanding of the new media.
[00:21:49.482 --> 00:21:53.665]  Because if you're an underfunded campaign, the new media is crucial.
[00:21:53.745 --> 00:21:55.366]  Nobody understood that until Bannon got involved.
[00:21:55.387 --> 00:21:56.727]  Is this not the biggest game changer ever?
[00:21:57.448 --> 00:22:02.612]  Looking at these maps, Trump on the verge of winning the presidency, Dredgeport.com and Fort Worth.com as well.
[00:22:04.072 --> 00:22:08.974]  What do we... I mean, I want to believe this, but then my gut's never wrong.
[00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:10.134]  I'm having major anxiety.
[00:22:10.194 --> 00:22:11.574]  Like, do they launch a war in the morning?
[00:22:12.095 --> 00:22:13.235]  What do they do to counter-strike us?
[00:22:13.255 --> 00:22:17.116]  Because I feel like we're winning, but my spidey sense is on high tingle.
[00:22:17.976 --> 00:22:20.677]  I think that this cake is baked.
[00:22:21.597 --> 00:22:25.539]  Again, I think the Clintons will spend their personal capital to stay out of prison.
[00:22:26.439 --> 00:22:28.099]  I think that makes the most sense.
[00:22:28.499 --> 00:22:31.200]  Barack Obama never had any love for them anyway.
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.281]  So why did the elite
[00:22:34.653 --> 00:22:51.072]  Put forward candidates that were clearly Parkinson's, out of their minds, doddering, mentally ill, having convulsions, nothing, I got family that has that, I'm not putting you down, it's just that why would this elite that is really criminal and evil, and George Soros,
[00:22:51.693 --> 00:22:52.774]  I guess she was kind of like him.
[00:22:52.854 --> 00:22:58.318]  I mean, why would they try to sell us something that was such an obvious loser?
[00:22:58.638 --> 00:22:59.358]  For two reasons.
[00:22:59.539 --> 00:23:04.382]  One, I think the Clintons have an absolute hammerlock on the money within the Democratic Party.
[00:23:04.942 --> 00:23:09.025]  And secondarily, they have a reputation for killing people who get in the way.
[00:23:09.285 --> 00:23:13.588]  But along came, I'm not bragging, this is true, Roger Stone, Alex Jones, Donald Trump,
[00:23:14.451 --> 00:23:16.855]  We just say, like you said, he's very fatalistic.
[00:23:17.075 --> 00:23:18.598]  So am I. I'm not looking for death.
[00:23:19.259 --> 00:23:20.961]  I'm just so much more manly than these people.
[00:23:21.001 --> 00:23:21.502]  I'm a brat.
[00:23:21.542 --> 00:23:22.323]  I don't give a damn.
[00:23:22.644 --> 00:23:23.746]  So is that what it was?
[00:23:23.766 --> 00:23:27.291]  They finally, well, she called us dark card and she really seems to be shook up.
[00:23:27.331 --> 00:23:29.414]  Is it she finally realized we're not backing down?
[00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:33.013]  No, look, I think that they can't even contain themselves.
[00:23:33.053 --> 00:23:35.315]  First of all, they attacked you in a television commercial.
[00:23:35.675 --> 00:23:36.596]  That's a high honor.
[00:23:36.897 --> 00:23:42.862]  She attacked you by name in a speech, and she told a reporter at Politico that she despises me.
[00:23:43.363 --> 00:23:48.048]  Look, I wear these things as a badge of honor, but there's two other guys I'd like to give credit to.
[00:23:48.808 --> 00:23:50.910]  Julie and Assange, who's been a truth teller.
[00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:51.771]  Yeah, who's the biggest?
[00:23:51.851 --> 00:23:53.893]  It's not about credit, but we need to look at this to protect.
[00:23:54.714 --> 00:23:56.436]  Is it Matt Grudge or Julian Assange?
[00:23:56.496 --> 00:23:59.138]  Because I can't decide who's the MVP.
[00:23:59.338 --> 00:24:02.140]  There's one more guy you have to have in there.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:02.981]  James O'Keefe.
[00:24:03.121 --> 00:24:07.824]  I agree, but O'Keefe, like you said, the guy strafing the Nazi railways.
[00:24:08.165 --> 00:24:08.925]  He's great.
[00:24:09.346 --> 00:24:10.567]  He's up there too.
[00:24:11.127 --> 00:24:12.648]  I've said that too, but let's get honest.
[00:24:12.728 --> 00:24:13.329]  It's Grudge.
[00:24:14.309 --> 00:24:15.030]  It's not Alex Jones.
[00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:15.671]  It's not Roger Stone.
[00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:18.472]  Because credit's important in this whole historical fight.
[00:24:18.833 --> 00:24:19.873]  And we don't have it yet.
[00:24:20.574 --> 00:24:21.775]  Is it Assange or is it Drudge?
[00:24:21.835 --> 00:24:22.735]  I want you to answer that question.
[00:24:22.855 --> 00:24:28.519]  Yeah, Alex, I think you do yourself a disservice by not addressing the role that Infowars has played in this revolution.
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.741]  Because this has been resistance central.
[00:24:31.801 --> 00:24:38.826]  And once you made the commitment, once you bought into Donald Trump and what he stood for, nobody's been more forthright.
[00:24:38.986 --> 00:24:45.991]  And even when he was under fire, even when people were ready to write him off, even when they said he's done, he attacked John McCain,
[00:24:46.271 --> 00:24:47.091]  He's done.
[00:24:47.131 --> 00:24:48.832]  He talked about the Mexican rapists.
[00:24:48.872 --> 00:24:49.292]  He's done.
[00:24:49.692 --> 00:24:51.472]  You never wavered.
[00:24:51.552 --> 00:24:53.033]  Not even a little bit.
[00:24:53.193 --> 00:24:57.254]  And how many times on this show have you told me, you know, I'm glad I'm here.
[00:24:57.434 --> 00:24:58.494]  I made the right decision.
[00:24:58.534 --> 00:24:59.535]  I've never regretted it.
[00:24:59.655 --> 00:25:02.035]  So I think you deserve credit.
[00:25:02.055 --> 00:25:03.036]  We're right there at the next tier.
[00:25:03.096 --> 00:25:03.816]  Our crew is as well.
[00:25:04.116 --> 00:25:05.116]  But it's important for history.
[00:25:05.336 --> 00:25:06.897]  The listeners, the people didn't waver.
[00:25:06.937 --> 00:25:07.677]  They're the MVP.
[00:25:07.717 --> 00:25:09.057]  But who is the MVP?
[00:25:09.398 --> 00:25:10.438]  Drudge or
[00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:15.307]  Well, look, I think Assange has got to be put in a special category.
[00:25:15.367 --> 00:25:17.689]  He wasn't trying to do this for Trump.
[00:25:18.089 --> 00:25:20.331]  He wasn't trying to do this to win an election.
[00:25:20.752 --> 00:25:26.717]  He was trying to do it because he recognizes the Clintons are intrinsically evil, just like the Bushes.
[00:25:26.817 --> 00:25:28.419]  It's like the FBI said, she's the Antichrist.
[00:25:29.299 --> 00:25:42.908]  Isn't it funny how liberals love Julian Assange when he was exposing the Bush administration, and then suddenly when he turned his fire on the Bush's partners, the Clintons, he's a liar, he's a sexual pervert.
[00:25:42.948 --> 00:25:47.211]  Like Beth Harris, a liberal, a great woman, exposed Bush.
[00:25:47.851 --> 00:25:49.212]  Great, I had her on.
[00:25:49.372 --> 00:25:49.993]  She's credible.
[00:25:50.153 --> 00:25:51.354]  I mean, I just exposed fraud.
[00:25:51.954 --> 00:25:54.235]  And she's like, they're trying to steal it from Trump, but they failed.
[00:25:54.475 --> 00:25:55.355]  I mean, have they failed yet?
[00:25:55.375 --> 00:25:56.056]  Let's look at these numbers.
[00:25:56.476 --> 00:25:58.017]  Let's put the latest.
[00:25:58.157 --> 00:26:01.638]  Owen Schroer and Margaret Howell, you guys pop in here.
[00:26:01.978 --> 00:26:03.299]  It looks like Trump's about to win.
[00:26:03.639 --> 00:26:05.239]  It's at 95% New York Times.
[00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:06.380]  Washington Post does the same thing.
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.201]  I was watching earlier MSNBC, CNN.
[00:26:10.522 --> 00:26:13.563]  Slimeball looks like he's having a heart attack right now.
[00:26:13.883 --> 00:26:16.344]  They're finally getting, Trump's at now 222 to 209.
[00:26:16.424 --> 00:26:17.444]  This is succulent.
[00:26:20.286 --> 00:26:21.308]  What state just went for him?
[00:26:21.328 --> 00:26:33.220]  I mean, this is just an epic repudiation of these narcissistic dumbasses who, I mean, you know, any really powerful, cool person is like, wants to hide out.
[00:26:33.621 --> 00:26:36.664]  They all want to just be out there on TV and everyone worshipping them.
[00:26:36.704 --> 00:26:37.305]  Go ahead, Roger.
[00:26:37.725 --> 00:26:40.568]  These Utah results, pull that up again.
[00:26:41.389 --> 00:26:44.531]  This is a personal repudiation of Mitt Romney.
[00:26:45.012 --> 00:26:57.261]  Romney went all out to try to divert votes to both Gary Johnson and Evan McMullin in an effort to tip the state in the Republican... McMullin is an admitted CIA officer to destabilize countries.
[00:26:57.581 --> 00:27:00.723]  He's not smart enough to be an officer to destabilize countries.
[00:27:00.823 --> 00:27:01.964]  But let's look at that.
[00:27:02.384 --> 00:27:03.405]  Not even close.
[00:27:03.625 --> 00:27:05.447]  He shouldn't be trying to destabilize the mothership.
[00:27:06.087 --> 00:27:08.969]  They have been telling us- What made America great, you piece of filth?
[00:27:09.609 --> 00:27:15.473]  For months they have been trying to tell us that Utah was in play and that Hillary had a shot because of the diversion.
[00:27:15.533 --> 00:27:24.119]  Now, there's no question that Mitt Romney worked the Mormon connections to try to move the state to Hillary Clinton and he has failed.
[00:27:24.159 --> 00:27:25.380]  You know who worked behind the scenes?
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.021]  Because he's Joel Skousen.
[00:27:27.521 --> 00:27:27.762]  Yes.
[00:27:28.062 --> 00:27:28.782]  Joel Skousen.
[00:27:29.142 --> 00:27:29.643]  Patriot.
[00:27:29.683 --> 00:27:32.345]  Key game changer annihilating this guy.
[00:27:32.485 --> 00:27:33.706]  A patriot, a real patriot.
[00:27:33.726 --> 00:27:35.467]  I knew his father, he was a patriot as well.
[00:27:36.367 --> 00:27:37.387]  He's scary smart.
[00:27:37.647 --> 00:27:38.228]  Yes, he did.
[00:27:38.828 --> 00:27:40.788]  Alright, this is an incredible time.
[00:27:41.529 --> 00:27:44.870]  We've got David, Darren Biggs, whoever wants to pop in, free-for-all right now.
[00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:46.830]  You're here with us, we're waiting for the announcement.
[00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:50.571]  Scan Fox and CNN, get ready for Trump's announcement.
[00:27:50.951 --> 00:27:52.672]  We're not out of the woods yet, but we're close.
[00:27:52.772 --> 00:28:01.294]  I mean, this is... What is this like for you?
[00:28:01.894 --> 00:28:03.215]  It's out to get us, folks.
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:05.901]  Well, I think she's not going to have her opportunity.
[00:28:06.521 --> 00:28:09.842]  My guess is that you can start fitting her for the handcuffs right now.
[00:28:09.862 --> 00:28:11.263]  That's right, folks, you're popping in.
[00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:12.563]  Joe Biggs, anybody?
[00:28:12.583 --> 00:28:13.043]  Yeah, we're here.
[00:28:13.063 --> 00:28:14.684]  Hey Alex, so this is Joe Biggs here.
[00:28:14.724 --> 00:28:16.905]  We're in the other studio, the Nightly News studio.
[00:28:16.945 --> 00:28:19.246]  I'm here with Darren McBreen and David Knight.
[00:28:19.526 --> 00:28:22.787]  And what I have is I have the actual Fox News page up right now.
[00:28:23.127 --> 00:28:26.388]  They're showing that Trump already has 254 electorates.
[00:28:26.408 --> 00:28:27.048]  He's down by 16.
[00:28:28.109 --> 00:28:31.010]  And right now, if you look at Michigan, it looks like
[00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:32.491]  That's 16 right there.
[00:28:32.531 --> 00:28:33.131]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[00:28:33.171 --> 00:28:35.874]  We're going with the New York Times because they're the enemy admitting he's winning.
[00:28:36.154 --> 00:28:39.817]  Let's put FoxNews.com on screen.
[00:28:40.077 --> 00:28:44.661]  Right now, Trump has a 48.2% lead over Hillary Clinton's 46.6%.
[00:28:45.482 --> 00:28:48.585]  If it turns out, they're at 64% in right now with the vote.
[00:28:48.905 --> 00:28:51.047]  If he wins Michigan, it's over right there.
[00:28:51.107 --> 00:28:51.808]  Bing bada boom.
[00:28:51.848 --> 00:28:52.408]  Trump wins.
[00:28:52.468 --> 00:28:53.489]  Make America Great Again.
[00:28:53.929 --> 00:28:54.610]  She is out.
[00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:55.551]  The corruption's over.
[00:28:55.911 --> 00:28:57.692]  We the people have taken this back, man.
[00:28:57.732 --> 00:29:04.455]  You know how the blood, the sweat, the tears, going to these rallies, being assaulted, the fact that we had to worry about being attacked.
[00:29:04.495 --> 00:29:12.478]  Biggs, Biggs, Biggs, you're a patriot, and I love you, and I agree with you, but let me tell you, there's going to be a counter-offensive, so we better start getting ready for that.
[00:29:12.538 --> 00:29:14.319]  Let's go back to that two-shot a second.
[00:29:14.399 --> 00:29:16.680]  Let's go back to the video.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.661]  Are those the Smith brothers or what?
[00:29:20.361 --> 00:29:20.882]  I'm sorry.
[00:29:20.922 --> 00:29:22.023]  I'm not trying to.
[00:29:22.043 --> 00:29:23.283]  Listen, I want the victory.
[00:29:23.363 --> 00:29:24.324]  Okay, I'm ready to die for this.
[00:29:24.344 --> 00:29:25.325]  We need to celebrate.
[00:29:25.345 --> 00:29:26.445]  This is time to celebrate.
[00:29:26.505 --> 00:29:28.287]  This is time to dance on their grave.
[00:29:28.847 --> 00:29:30.888]  Okay, so wait.
[00:29:30.948 --> 00:29:32.229]  Have we won?
[00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:35.151]  Let's show Fox News again.
[00:29:35.171 --> 00:29:36.272]  Turn his camera around.
[00:29:36.392 --> 00:29:37.533]  Let's show what Biggs is looking at.
[00:29:38.253 --> 00:29:41.175]  We're at 254 right now to Hillary Clinton's.
[00:29:41.255 --> 00:29:41.875]  I'm waiting on this to read. 209.
[00:29:43.171 --> 00:29:45.872]  Yes, so there is a great chance that we have this.
[00:29:46.172 --> 00:29:49.553]  This is what I've been using all night, and it's been correct so far.
[00:29:49.834 --> 00:29:53.775]  CNN shows a lower number, so does the New York Times, but still, he's way ahead.
[00:29:53.795 --> 00:29:57.897]  And if she was to win, it looks like all the other states now, she'd still lose.
[00:29:57.937 --> 00:30:00.898]  So I think, let's do the math, I think we can declare her first.
[00:30:01.238 --> 00:30:02.959]  The 45th president is Donald J. Trump.
[00:30:21.744 --> 00:30:22.506]  Arizona is 11.
[00:30:22.987 --> 00:30:24.331]  Right now Trump is up 39% to 45%.
[00:30:32.489 --> 00:30:32.689]  Huh?
[00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:35.550]  I remember about like eight months ago I had you out there at the Bundy's covering it.
[00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:37.171]  You were like, well, I want to see his plan.
[00:30:37.191 --> 00:30:37.911]  I don't like Hillary.
[00:30:37.931 --> 00:30:38.792]  Yeah, I want to see his plan.
[00:30:38.872 --> 00:30:40.192]  Once I saw his plan, I was all about it.
[00:30:40.212 --> 00:30:42.573]  There was no plan at the point then.
[00:30:43.434 --> 00:30:45.775]  Alex Roger, let's talk about who the big losers are here.
[00:30:46.135 --> 00:30:47.676]  Big loser, RNC.
[00:30:47.996 --> 00:30:51.457]  They spent zero dollars, not even a penny.
[00:30:51.517 --> 00:30:54.458]  In fact, he raised the money, which he was supposed to do as an obligation.
[00:30:54.739 --> 00:30:55.579]  They spent zero.
[00:30:55.599 --> 00:30:56.879]  That's a great point, Biggs, as well.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:57.680]  That's a great point.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:06.631]  Well, my comment is this, that Virginia allowed 60,000 felons to vote.
[00:31:06.992 --> 00:31:10.737]  Hillary won Virginia by 60,000 votes.
[00:31:11.017 --> 00:31:12.740]  That's rattling to the top of drudge right now.
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.181]  A million provisional ballots too.
[00:31:14.713 --> 00:31:15.893]  So, big loser list?
[00:31:16.073 --> 00:31:16.933]  Terry McAuliffe.
[00:31:17.434 --> 00:31:18.374]  Right up there at the top.
[00:31:18.694 --> 00:31:23.535]  Well, he's just trying to preserve his voting rights as a soon-to-be felon himself.
[00:31:23.575 --> 00:31:24.275]  Probably right.
[00:31:24.655 --> 00:31:26.956]  That's a good look at M4 right there, Bix.
[00:31:26.976 --> 00:31:27.816]  Can we please see that?
[00:31:28.076 --> 00:31:33.857]  Well, I've got this up here just because, you know, if Trump wins, you know, we can save the Supreme Court.
[00:31:34.557 --> 00:31:38.898]  We can put some people in there that are going to protect our Second Amendment rights.
[00:31:39.278 --> 00:31:40.758]  That almost looks better in Marilyn Monroe.
[00:31:40.898 --> 00:31:43.519]  Is that pornographic to have that out fully naked?
[00:31:44.891 --> 00:31:45.891]  It's a beautiful thing.
[00:31:45.951 --> 00:31:49.372]  I mean, you know, this is a celebration not just for America, but for our rights.
[00:31:49.992 --> 00:31:50.812]  I like my guns.
[00:31:50.832 --> 00:31:53.032]  I like the ability... Well, that's why I'm so upset.
[00:31:53.092 --> 00:31:54.513]  I mean, they're going to get the Supreme Court.
[00:31:54.553 --> 00:31:55.753]  They admit they're coming after us.
[00:31:56.433 --> 00:31:57.153]  That's a scary thing.
[00:31:57.553 --> 00:32:01.634]  David, I like the urve you've got going here.
[00:32:01.654 --> 00:32:03.134]  Let's figure out the other losers.
[00:32:03.294 --> 00:32:05.935]  I would nominate Governor John Kasich.
[00:32:06.355 --> 00:32:07.115]  Major loser.
[00:32:07.315 --> 00:32:10.015]  What an arrogant middle patient.
[00:32:10.035 --> 00:32:11.416]  He just walks around like he's God.
[00:32:11.436 --> 00:32:13.656]  Is he like eating 20 X's an hour?
[00:32:14.316 --> 00:32:24.461]  And the other guy there, John Weaver, his right-hand man, the Ghanif, as we call him, had a great op-ed piece last week about why Trump could not win and he could not support Trump.
[00:32:24.561 --> 00:32:26.602]  So they're both on the loser list.
[00:32:26.662 --> 00:32:28.723]  Tim Kennedy just texted me right now.
[00:32:28.763 --> 00:32:29.643]  He goes, what the F?
[00:32:29.984 --> 00:32:33.765]  Trump is going to get this exclamation, exclamation, exclamation on for about a mile.
[00:32:34.546 --> 00:32:36.307]  I think everybody's starting to see the truth right now.
[00:32:36.327 --> 00:32:38.908]  By the way, did you hear the guy he was supposed to fight chickened out and quit?
[00:32:39.728 --> 00:32:41.550]  Um, yeah, well I heard there was a deal.
[00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:42.971]  He went out of the country or something.
[00:32:42.991 --> 00:32:46.534]  He went to an area to kind of avoid... Testing.
[00:32:46.674 --> 00:32:47.435]  Yeah, testing.
[00:32:47.535 --> 00:32:48.636]  And then something popped up.
[00:32:48.736 --> 00:32:50.338]  And the InfoWars sponsored heavyweight.
[00:32:50.378 --> 00:32:51.058]  Doesn't get debated.
[00:32:51.939 --> 00:32:52.540]  That's what's great.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.461]  It's like, it's surreal.
[00:32:54.481 --> 00:32:55.362]  Because I'm on a power trip.
[00:32:55.382 --> 00:32:56.443]  I never wanted to be establishment.
[00:32:56.984 --> 00:32:58.545]  We want to fix the country, America, America.
[00:32:58.565 --> 00:33:01.407]  But InfoWars is the zeitgeist on every area.
[00:33:02.148 --> 00:33:04.989]  Alex, we sponsored the biggest fight known to man and won.
[00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:11.832]  Infowars is behind this huge movement to help push Trump to the forefront with the help of Roger Stone.
[00:33:11.912 --> 00:33:12.152]  I agree.
[00:33:12.192 --> 00:33:14.193]  Let's bring in David Nye, the known Troyer and others.
[00:33:14.213 --> 00:33:15.153]  I want everybody to comment here.
[00:33:15.193 --> 00:33:16.154]  We should probably take calls too.
[00:33:16.194 --> 00:33:19.755]  I would add another loser to this, and that is network television.
[00:33:19.855 --> 00:33:20.996]  I was just going to say that.
[00:33:21.036 --> 00:33:22.216]  That's the biggest loser.
[00:33:22.236 --> 00:33:25.117]  The mainstream media is the ultimate loser right here.
[00:33:25.417 --> 00:33:31.640]  And I have to admit, I have not enjoyed watching MSNBC as much as I have tonight.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:36.606]  Because the last half hour, I mean, Rachel Maddow looks like she was about to shit herself.
[00:33:36.767 --> 00:33:37.548]  Darren, I was just thinking that.
[00:33:37.628 --> 00:33:40.031]  She had the look on her face like she was... Here's what I got.
[00:33:40.111 --> 00:33:40.852]  Here's what I got.
[00:33:41.072 --> 00:33:42.334]  She's hating it right now.
[00:33:42.514 --> 00:33:43.956]  But if you know this, you make your own.
[00:33:44.682 --> 00:33:45.242]  If you're going to.
[00:33:45.262 --> 00:33:56.027]  You know, the thing too is that, again we're talking about the fact that the RNC didn't spend a cent for Donald Trump, but think about how much money people like Jeb Bush spent on network television.
[00:33:56.247 --> 00:33:58.028]  Think about how much money Hillary Clinton spent.
[00:33:58.048 --> 00:33:58.448]  It all failed.
[00:33:58.488 --> 00:33:59.288]  It's a collapse of them.
[00:33:59.308 --> 00:33:59.628]  I agree.
[00:33:59.648 --> 00:34:00.389]  We'll come back to you in a moment.
[00:34:00.409 --> 00:34:01.769]  We'll do Facebook missions separately.
[00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:03.190]  Looking for Trump's big announcement.
[00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:04.230]  Looks like he has one.
[00:34:04.711 --> 00:34:06.671]  Owen Schroer, Margaret Howell, you guys pop in.
[00:34:06.691 --> 00:34:07.732]  You've been chopping there.
[00:34:07.932 --> 00:34:09.853]  I have to agree with Dave.
[00:34:09.913 --> 00:34:10.634]  Dave and I is right.
[00:34:10.674 --> 00:34:13.576]  The mainstream news are the biggest losers by far.
[00:34:13.636 --> 00:34:15.117]  They thought they controlled the narrative.
[00:34:15.337 --> 00:34:19.160]  They thought they could go on TV arrogantly and tell us how this thing was going to go.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.341]  Tell us how to vote.
[00:34:20.621 --> 00:34:21.742]  Tell us what Trump is.
[00:34:22.082 --> 00:34:23.803]  And we beat their propaganda.
[00:34:23.823 --> 00:34:25.925]  The American people beat their propaganda.
[00:34:26.725 --> 00:34:33.871]  And, I was watching on, Alex, you were talking about all the mainstream news, the MSNs, the Foxes, CNNs.
[00:34:34.491 --> 00:34:35.692]  Fox, actually, not so bad.
[00:34:35.872 --> 00:34:40.035]  CNN is like, oh, nobody knew this was gonna happen!
[00:34:40.195 --> 00:34:40.996]  Everybody's shocked!
[00:34:41.116 --> 00:34:42.277]  I can't believe this is happening!
[00:34:42.337 --> 00:34:43.318]  Nobody saw this coming!
[00:34:43.378 --> 00:34:43.698]  Nobody!
[00:34:43.758 --> 00:34:44.479]  It's not possible!
[00:34:44.519 --> 00:34:45.159]  How is this happening?
[00:34:45.359 --> 00:34:45.620]  They knew...
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:50.283]  No, you were wrong the whole time, just like you always are.
[00:34:50.543 --> 00:34:55.246]  You lied to the American people the entire election cycle, just like you always do.
[00:34:55.587 --> 00:34:57.628]  And they're sitting here acting like this is some sort of shocker.
[00:34:57.908 --> 00:34:59.429]  We knew this was going to happen, folks.
[00:34:59.509 --> 00:35:00.690]  It was easy to see.
[00:35:01.011 --> 00:35:06.194]  What everybody has to remember, though, tonight, though, patriots, everybody out here who voted for Trump needs to be on high alert tonight.
[00:35:06.414 --> 00:35:09.837]  There's going to be sore sleeper cells out there, the same kind of people you saw Hillary Clinton
[00:35:10.237 --> 00:35:12.959]  Take and put in these rallies to spark violence.
[00:35:13.259 --> 00:35:14.420]  These people are going to be angry.
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:15.421]  They're going to have them out there.
[00:35:15.441 --> 00:35:17.102]  They're going to unleash them on the streets.
[00:35:17.362 --> 00:35:18.523]  People got to be on high alert, man.
[00:35:18.563 --> 00:35:19.043]  It's not over.
[00:35:19.223 --> 00:35:21.004]  We need to point out what's happening in Michigan.
[00:35:21.124 --> 00:35:23.326]  Really quickly, how close Michigan is.
[00:35:23.406 --> 00:35:24.507]  I don't know if you guys can see this.
[00:35:24.787 --> 00:35:26.828]  We're talking about razor thin here.
[00:35:26.848 --> 00:35:26.828]  1.7.
[00:35:26.868 --> 00:35:30.631]  We were just told this update in Michigan.
[00:35:30.651 --> 00:35:31.652]  It looks like he has it.
[00:35:32.052 --> 00:35:33.073]  He hasn't clenched it yet.
[00:35:33.193 --> 00:35:35.554]  But this is definitely in the bag.
[00:35:36.875 --> 00:35:39.658]  If he wins Michigan and New Hampshire, I don't see how he loses.
[00:35:40.318 --> 00:35:42.380]  I think Donald Trump wins two... It's not over yet.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.441]  I think he wins 289 to 249.
[00:35:43.561 --> 00:35:48.846]  Hey Owen, the reason that CNN is so surprised... Guys, guys, let me interrupt.
[00:35:48.866 --> 00:35:51.548]  They're waiting for their talking points from the DNC.
[00:35:52.149 --> 00:35:52.829]  For Wolf Blitzer.
[00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:56.393]  And they keep telling him she's going to win and we just know she's going to win, right?
[00:35:56.413 --> 00:35:58.495]  We've got breaking news.
[00:35:58.575 --> 00:36:02.519]  Pennsylvania has fallen to America from the globalist's hands.
[00:36:02.599 --> 00:36:08.285]  Pennsylvania, the state they said nobody could get, has fallen to Trump with what is low at 48.3.
[00:36:08.325 --> 00:36:08.966]  The 48.3, that is a liberal.
[00:36:14.091 --> 00:36:26.504]  So a state that eluded Mitt Romney, eluded John McCain, eluded George W. Bush, hasn't fallen yet.
[00:36:26.544 --> 00:36:27.725]  I don't want to announce this prematurely.
[00:36:27.745 --> 00:36:29.487]  8,000 votes is what we're looking at.
[00:36:29.527 --> 00:36:31.349]  It's pink, it's not quite red just yet.
[00:36:32.571 --> 00:36:57.028]  And credit here has to go... 48.2% to 48.3% Credit here has to go to David Urban, who ran the campaign, a hard-bitten West Point graduate, one of the most capable pals that I know, came in late, came in only at the Pennsylvania primary, pulled that out for Trump, and then agreed to take on the job of driving Pennsylvania to victory.
[00:36:57.168 --> 00:36:58.869]  So kudos to him.
[00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:02.163]  One of the best decisions that the Trump leadership has made.
[00:37:02.244 --> 00:37:02.746]  David Urban.
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.741]  Looking at the electoral map, we can do the map here.
[00:37:05.761 --> 00:37:06.801]  Let's put it up on screen.
[00:37:06.821 --> 00:37:12.203]  If you look at New York Times, it has it, you know, still for Trump, but not as good as... What are you trying to do?
[00:37:12.843 --> 00:37:13.663]  As Fox News.
[00:37:14.724 --> 00:37:17.785]  But right here, I mean, is there any way they can win?
[00:37:17.805 --> 00:37:29.688]  We've got Nevada, we've got Arizona, we've got Minnesota, it looks like they still have Michigan hanging out there, and then we've got Maine, and we've got Delaware.
[00:37:29.768 --> 00:37:31.209]  So that's all that's left here.
[00:37:32.189 --> 00:37:36.033]  Look at that as one of the top political wonks in the world.
[00:37:36.113 --> 00:37:37.514]  Roger Stone, so honored to have you here.
[00:37:37.534 --> 00:37:40.217]  It's amazing history just to have you here.
[00:37:40.397 --> 00:37:41.658]  What on earth do you make of this?
[00:37:41.878 --> 00:37:46.783]  Trump will carry Arizona, but even if you add those, she still doesn't make it.
[00:37:48.698 --> 00:37:52.041]  My people have enough in Michigan to tell me that it will fall to Trump.
[00:37:52.061 --> 00:37:53.322]  Well, they've had him way ahead.
[00:37:53.562 --> 00:37:53.782]  Right.
[00:37:53.922 --> 00:37:55.743]  So, I think this is cooked.
[00:37:55.903 --> 00:38:01.107]  I mean, I think we have just seen history being made and the greatest upset since 1948.
[00:38:01.328 --> 00:38:03.749]  Well, let's talk about it then.
[00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:05.130]  What of a radio list?
[00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:06.652]  There's a lot of affiliates who are picking us up.
[00:38:07.432 --> 00:38:13.518]  So let's be careful, myself included, not using non-King's English here and using Frenchie.
[00:38:14.278 --> 00:38:15.740]  Let's go back here and let's look.
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:19.744]  In the general election right now, what are the numbers?
[00:38:20.164 --> 00:38:22.086]  What is the New York Times saying the percentage victory is?
[00:38:22.106 --> 00:38:22.686]  Let's scroll down.
[00:38:23.087 --> 00:38:23.507]  Is it still 95%?
[00:38:24.668 --> 00:38:25.929]  And what is the electoral numbers?
[00:38:28.343 --> 00:38:30.946]  Right now, right now, popular vote, you know, Hillary has 49,985,201 votes.
[00:38:30.966 --> 00:38:31.547]  Trump has 51,170,404 votes.
[00:38:31.587 --> 00:38:33.028]  So he's led the popular vote the whole day.
[00:38:33.049 --> 00:38:34.931]  He's really controlled the narrative.
[00:38:34.991 --> 00:38:36.753]  And we got a sign over here... And Biggs, give us that number.
[00:38:36.793 --> 00:38:37.493]  How many more than roughly...
[00:38:46.483 --> 00:38:48.866]  Well, right now, Trump has 254 right now.
[00:38:48.927 --> 00:38:49.387]  We need 16.
[00:38:50.268 --> 00:38:53.292]  Now, with a win in Michigan, Michigan in itself is 16.
[00:38:53.352 --> 00:38:56.656]  So, taking Michigan right now, we call that, we can win that.
[00:38:56.996 --> 00:39:00.901]  And just adding Pennsylvania, adding Arizona, only just
[00:39:01.562 --> 00:39:03.923]  Just makes the victory more sweeter.
[00:39:04.284 --> 00:39:06.345]  So right now it pretty much falls on Michigan.
[00:39:06.365 --> 00:39:07.705]  I think they'll be the next to be called.
[00:39:08.246 --> 00:39:09.106]  That's my opinion.
[00:39:09.146 --> 00:39:10.347]  It's so close, like Margaret said.
[00:39:10.367 --> 00:39:13.769]  No, I agree, but I'm looking at real clear politics in Fox right now.
[00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:15.109]  Let's put that back on screen.
[00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:19.132]  You have him at almost 50 electoral votes against her.
[00:39:19.672 --> 00:39:22.093]  She'd have to win everything that's still open to be there.
[00:39:22.373 --> 00:39:24.314]  She's at 209, he's at 254.
[00:39:24.735 --> 00:39:26.455]  He is 40 plus points ahead of her.
[00:39:26.475 --> 00:39:29.097]  I mean, I want to declare this.
[00:39:29.377 --> 00:39:30.218]  Can I say he's won?
[00:39:31.278 --> 00:39:32.018]  I believe you can.
[00:39:33.119 --> 00:39:36.360]  Donald Trump is the 45th President of the United States.
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.901]  I'm holding up my sign that says Dewey wins.
[00:39:38.921 --> 00:39:48.486]  I don't think you can see this on the camera, but... Yeah, can we pull up a famous newspaper, you know, President Truman.
[00:39:48.646 --> 00:39:49.806]  Truman, Dewey wins.
[00:39:49.946 --> 00:39:51.207]  Truman, Dewey wins.
[00:39:51.807 --> 00:39:53.068]  Google Images.
[00:39:53.148 --> 00:39:53.508]  Truman.
[00:39:54.304 --> 00:39:56.726]  Dewey wins, and of course he won in a landslide.
[00:39:56.786 --> 00:39:58.307]  Not Dewey, but Harry Truman.
[00:39:59.008 --> 00:40:00.930]  When he first got elected, it was in 1946.
[00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:03.011]  Then after that, Eisenhower came in.
[00:40:03.031 --> 00:40:03.852]  Can we put that on screen?
[00:40:03.912 --> 00:40:04.773]  Because I can Google it.
[00:40:05.233 --> 00:40:07.015]  Here, I'll do it.
[00:40:07.035 --> 00:40:07.015]  48.
[00:40:07.055 --> 00:40:08.596]  There it is.
[00:40:08.616 --> 00:40:09.817]  Yeah, Dewey defeats Truman.
[00:40:15.207 --> 00:40:16.048]  But let's talk about this.
[00:40:16.088 --> 00:40:16.870]  I want to go through everybody.
[00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:19.716]  We're going to take a break so you can make a few phone calls and come back for the big victory lap.
[00:40:20.176 --> 00:40:21.840]  And, you know, let you get a glass of water or whatever.
[00:40:22.501 --> 00:40:23.603]  Roger Stone here in Austin with us.
[00:40:23.623 --> 00:40:24.585]  I'm so honored you were here with us.
[00:40:26.571 --> 00:40:27.051]  It's true.
[00:40:27.111 --> 00:40:28.632]  It's a repudiation of mainstream media.
[00:40:28.692 --> 00:40:30.232]  It's a repudiation of the establishment.
[00:40:30.252 --> 00:40:31.893]  I mean, we've known.
[00:40:32.653 --> 00:40:40.175]  Their own rating services say they have 100,000 viewers on average for big networks that spend ten times more money than we do.
[00:40:41.696 --> 00:40:47.598]  They're just such loathed, hated... It's like taking dirty diapers out or something.
[00:40:47.618 --> 00:40:48.438]  They have no value.
[00:40:49.858 --> 00:40:50.659]  Where do they go now?
[00:40:50.859 --> 00:40:51.419]  All of you.
[00:40:51.459 --> 00:40:51.899]  Roger Stone.
[00:40:53.015 --> 00:40:54.775]  Well, it's very hard to say.
[00:40:54.795 --> 00:40:58.576]  There's a lot of implications here you've got to think through.
[00:40:58.756 --> 00:41:01.237]  I really like where David Knight is headed.
[00:41:01.317 --> 00:41:04.018]  I like chalking up the winners and the losers.
[00:41:04.638 --> 00:41:07.198]  A loser for the night, Megyn Kelly.
[00:41:07.218 --> 00:41:10.059]  A winner for the night, Monica Crowley.
[00:41:10.439 --> 00:41:14.160]  I mean, let's punish our enemies and reward our friends.
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:15.540]  Keep going.
[00:41:15.741 --> 00:41:17.382]  So you list your winners and losers.
[00:41:17.682 --> 00:41:18.762]  Mainstream media losers.
[00:41:18.923 --> 00:41:19.723]  Democratic Party.
[00:41:19.983 --> 00:41:20.503]  Globalist.
[00:41:20.744 --> 00:41:21.504]  George Soros.
[00:41:21.584 --> 00:41:22.145]  The UN.
[00:41:22.445 --> 00:41:23.245]  Unelected groups.
[00:41:23.305 --> 00:41:23.966]  TPP.
[00:41:24.306 --> 00:41:25.246]  What else is a loser?
[00:41:25.266 --> 00:41:25.707]  What's a winner?
[00:41:27.277 --> 00:41:32.200]  Alex, I've got one that looks like a loser, but I think in the long run he's going to be a winner, and a winner for us.
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:37.283]  Sheriff Joe, looks like, has lost his re-election bid in Arizona.
[00:41:38.184 --> 00:41:40.645]  George Soros spent $2 million.
[00:41:40.665 --> 00:41:41.826]  $2 million.
[00:41:41.886 --> 00:41:43.747]  That's on the books.
[00:41:43.767 --> 00:41:45.789]  They had the entire national media target him.
[00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.429]  That's right.
[00:41:46.909 --> 00:41:54.952]  Okay, so they get him out, if they get him out of the sheriff's, and it looks like the press is reporting that he lost, I don't know if he's made a concession speech or not, but anyway, it looks like he's lost.
[00:41:55.112 --> 00:42:05.296]  If he loses, they may rue the day, because I think he's going to be picked up by Donald Trump to either run ICE or to run Border Patrol or whatever, I think we're going to see.
[00:42:05.536 --> 00:42:08.177]  We need somebody like Jim Jones to control the borders in a real way.
[00:42:08.197 --> 00:42:14.619]  And we're not being mean, but you can't just open the border and bring in tuberculosis and cholera and everything.
[00:42:15.259 --> 00:42:15.639]  That's right.
[00:42:15.659 --> 00:42:23.427]  So I think even though, even if he is a winner, I think in the long term, a loser, he is in the long term a winner, and he will be a winner for the United States.
[00:42:23.447 --> 00:42:25.689]  We're going to the Bigs in a minute, but keep going.
[00:42:25.729 --> 00:42:26.530]  Winners and losers here.
[00:42:27.091 --> 00:42:27.791]  I'm going to slide off.
[00:42:27.852 --> 00:42:29.974]  You're going to go make your phone call.
[00:42:30.054 --> 00:42:34.238]  I want to add to the loser list, let's add the Bush dynasty.
[00:42:34.758 --> 00:42:35.139]  Oh yeah.
[00:42:35.439 --> 00:42:36.720]  We can put the Bushes up there.
[00:42:36.881 --> 00:42:37.281]  Big time.
[00:42:37.441 --> 00:42:38.221]  The Young Turks!
[00:42:39.142 --> 00:42:39.762]  Alright, alright.
[00:42:39.782 --> 00:42:43.765]  I'm going to let you guys take over for 10 minutes because I'm going to make some calls to Trump Tower.
[00:42:43.865 --> 00:42:49.288]  I can't wait to see the Young Turks make their little YouTube videos and let's watch Chink fight his way out of this one.
[00:42:49.388 --> 00:42:49.808]  Oh, no, no.
[00:42:50.008 --> 00:42:53.070]  They claim Republicans try to stop women's suffrage.
[00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:56.232]  This was the latest thing this week, but it was Republicans that did it.
[00:42:56.653 --> 00:42:58.494]  Next they'll say Abraham Lincoln was a Democrat.
[00:42:58.734 --> 00:43:00.876]  But guys, we got two host groups here.
[00:43:01.136 --> 00:43:03.358]  Let's get Owen, we haven't heard anything from Margaret.
[00:43:03.658 --> 00:43:04.779]  Let's have them comment a few minutes.
[00:43:04.799 --> 00:43:06.601]  You guys go back and forth with this.
[00:43:06.661 --> 00:43:09.263]  I'm gonna go with Stone, make some phone calls, check the numbers.
[00:43:09.523 --> 00:43:11.205]  I'm gonna come right back in about 10-15 minutes.
[00:43:11.665 --> 00:43:13.266]  This is 11-16 Central.
[00:43:13.627 --> 00:43:14.908]  Margaret Howell, take over for a minute.
[00:43:15.299 --> 00:43:18.141]  Okay, so this is what I want to say, and back to Darren McBrain for a moment.
[00:43:18.221 --> 00:43:19.881]  I was just thinking of Rachel Maddow.
[00:43:20.582 --> 00:43:23.123]  We put up with so much from her over the past couple of months.
[00:43:23.423 --> 00:43:23.964]  Can you imagine?
[00:43:23.984 --> 00:43:30.147]  She's probably doing the Clinton carpet roll, where she's just, you know, spinning violently and chewing the carpet right now.
[00:43:30.167 --> 00:43:35.810]  I'm guessing that all of the media that did this over the past few months... Oh, and what do you think?
[00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:36.831]  Is she doing the carpet roll?
[00:43:37.031 --> 00:43:37.251]  Yes.
[00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:38.871]  I don't know.
[00:43:38.891 --> 00:43:39.571]  I'm curious.
[00:43:39.591 --> 00:43:41.092]  Do they buy their own nonsense?
[00:43:41.573 --> 00:43:43.994]  Like, are they for real acting shocked?
[00:43:44.014 --> 00:43:45.416]  Like, oh my gosh, I didn't know Trump was going to win.
[00:43:45.436 --> 00:43:45.556]  Really?
[00:43:45.576 --> 00:43:48.258]  I would probably be a fly on the wall a million times right now.
[00:43:48.478 --> 00:43:49.098]  Literally, right?
[00:43:49.278 --> 00:43:55.603]  You know, I knew, literally, when she called out Alex and said that he had that dark heart, you knew that slip.
[00:43:55.983 --> 00:43:58.925]  She showed too many cards with that, honestly.
[00:43:59.306 --> 00:44:00.427]  She was in serious trouble then.
[00:44:01.167 --> 00:44:01.927]  You've got the cigar.
[00:44:02.388 --> 00:44:06.070]  ONA's about to pop the champagne, by the way, where Leanne told me not to allow you.
[00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:06.650]  I mean, Alex called it.
[00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:08.191]  Can I, can I, where's Rob Dew?
[00:44:08.271 --> 00:44:08.831]  Rob Dew?
[00:44:08.931 --> 00:44:09.532]  Let's wait.
[00:44:09.992 --> 00:44:10.612]  Ah, we want to wait.
[00:44:10.632 --> 00:44:12.573]  We want to wait just a little longer.
[00:44:12.633 --> 00:44:13.794]  Not to allow him.
[00:44:13.834 --> 00:44:15.715]  Hey, Mark, you know what?
[00:44:15.755 --> 00:44:17.096]  I don't believe the mainstream media.
[00:44:17.216 --> 00:44:23.379]  I don't take my cues from mainstream media, and even though they haven't called it, I'm calling it for Donald Trump personally.
[00:44:23.699 --> 00:44:25.781]  I don't care what the mainstream media says.
[00:44:25.941 --> 00:44:27.883]  I never care about what the mainstream media says.
[00:44:28.203 --> 00:44:37.791]  Donald Trump won this, the American people won this, and it is a huge defeat for the establishment, for the RNC, for the television networks, for the political establishment.
[00:44:38.331 --> 00:44:43.896]  There's a long list of losers and an even longer list of winners because the American people are going to be the ones who win tonight.
[00:44:43.956 --> 00:44:47.637]  Well, I want to add one more to the winner, and that is social media.
[00:44:47.877 --> 00:44:48.017]  Yeah.
[00:44:48.337 --> 00:44:50.278]  Because this has really been a fight.
[00:44:50.298 --> 00:44:50.478]  Twitter!
[00:44:50.498 --> 00:44:51.378]  What can we do to Twitter?
[00:44:51.458 --> 00:44:51.778]  Oh, man.
[00:44:51.879 --> 00:44:52.899]  WikiLeaks, Twitter.
[00:44:53.259 --> 00:45:00.001]  And it's just, it's been a huge fight, and it's always been social media and Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton and the establishment media.
[00:45:00.281 --> 00:45:01.041]  And we win!
[00:45:01.482 --> 00:45:03.422]  The Republic has been saved!
[00:45:03.522 --> 00:45:04.723]  They already walked into hell!
[00:45:04.743 --> 00:45:07.864]  Matt Drudge, Assange, WikiLeaks, big winners.
[00:45:07.944 --> 00:45:08.124]  Yes.
[00:45:08.144 --> 00:45:08.544]  Go ahead.
[00:45:08.564 --> 00:45:09.104]  Go ahead, Margaret.
[00:45:09.484 --> 00:45:17.249]  Literally the man walked into hell all bets were off and we were even in the office a few hours ago We were all you could feel this somber tension.
[00:45:17.289 --> 00:45:29.718]  It was just like we were we were preparing ourselves Well, Owen had you know, he's like never there was a I remember being on air this morning at 4 a.m Taking calls from people in New York at 5 a.m.
[00:45:29.758 --> 00:45:30.698]  People on the West Coast.
[00:45:30.778 --> 00:45:32.039]  It was 2 a.m.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:38.624]  And everybody agreed that there was a sense of calm there was a sense of ease there was a sense of calm
[00:45:39.484 --> 00:45:41.825]  Relaxation, like, it was a good day.
[00:45:41.945 --> 00:45:43.005]  It was gonna be a good day.
[00:45:43.145 --> 00:45:48.186]  Even though it was raining all day in Austin, I still felt like today was the dawn.
[00:45:48.346 --> 00:45:53.508]  Today was really the dawn, and now we have the dawn as the president, it looks like to me.
[00:45:53.548 --> 00:45:55.028]  We got some breaking news from RT.
[00:45:55.068 --> 00:45:56.109]  This is kind of funny.
[00:45:56.549 --> 00:45:58.209]  Canada immigration website crashes.
[00:45:58.229 --> 00:45:58.709]  It's down!
[00:45:58.809 --> 00:45:59.429]  It's down!
[00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:00.650]  Strong Trump lead.
[00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:02.110]  It's down!
[00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:03.431]  That's not Hollywood.
[00:46:03.631 --> 00:46:07.452]  That's the Clinton Foundation staff trying to get out before they get indicted.
[00:46:07.512 --> 00:46:08.592]  Exactly what's happening.
[00:46:15.676 --> 00:46:21.559]  There's people here that actually think that they're gonna have to get deported now because Trump's president.
[00:46:21.579 --> 00:46:27.602]  They've bought this whole lie that Trump's just gonna deport anyone who's not an American citizen born and raised.
[00:46:28.002 --> 00:46:33.025]  No, he just wants to actually follow the law, have a border, and get rid of the criminals.
[00:46:33.085 --> 00:46:33.525]  That's it.
[00:46:34.105 --> 00:46:38.688]  So, you know, you don't need to be rushing back to Canada, you know, if you're here on a visa or whatever.
[00:46:38.748 --> 00:46:40.108]  It's okay, just don't break the law.
[00:46:40.128 --> 00:46:40.408]  You'll be fine.
[00:46:40.428 --> 00:46:44.591]  Hey Owen, you made that list of celebrities yesterday.
[00:46:45.231 --> 00:46:45.311]  Oh!
[00:46:45.351 --> 00:46:45.971]  Get them out!
[00:46:45.991 --> 00:46:47.832]  Get them gone, baby!
[00:46:47.892 --> 00:46:49.733]  You think Amy Schumer's gonna leave?
[00:46:49.833 --> 00:46:50.374]  I doubt it.
[00:46:50.394 --> 00:46:53.836]  Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.
[00:46:53.916 --> 00:46:55.536]  Oh, there's quite a few celebrities.
[00:46:55.717 --> 00:46:57.297]  I will take a hunk of my money.
[00:46:57.658 --> 00:46:59.298]  I'll buy that plane ticket for you.
[00:46:59.358 --> 00:47:00.279]  Just get the hell out.
[00:47:00.299 --> 00:47:01.800]  Well, we get to see the triggering now.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:06.822]  I mean, they're going to have videos.
[00:47:06.942 --> 00:47:08.783]  I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
[00:47:08.903 --> 00:47:12.304]  I think Saturday Night Live is going to move from New York to Ottawa or something, right?
[00:47:14.165 --> 00:47:15.406]  Alec Baldwin will see you later.
[00:47:15.426 --> 00:47:19.548]  All of the demons in Washington.
[00:47:22.717 --> 00:47:24.538]  I mean, the demonic energy in Washington.
[00:47:25.038 --> 00:47:26.358]  I can only imagine the fear.
[00:47:26.378 --> 00:47:28.499]  I have exorcised the demons.
[00:47:28.919 --> 00:47:29.580]  Seriously.
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:31.400]  This house is clear.
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:33.801]  Scurrying under every rock they can find.
[00:47:33.901 --> 00:47:35.062]  I mean, this is just rough.
[00:47:35.482 --> 00:47:40.224]  Anyway, not politically correct, but you know, the demonic energy in Washington.
[00:47:42.452 --> 00:47:48.918]  The other thing that's happening right now, and of course it shows another group of losers, and that is the stock markets.
[00:47:49.039 --> 00:47:57.387]  All these hedge fund managers, the big bank people, you know, they're not really feeling it right now, and so they are selling off big time.
[00:47:57.427 --> 00:48:01.511]  We've got world markets down, and this is not the end of the economy.
[00:48:01.531 --> 00:48:02.272]  It'll be like Brexit.
[00:48:02.572 --> 00:48:03.812]  This is not the end of trade.
[00:48:04.133 --> 00:48:10.295]  This is Brexit Part Deux, and I know you guys don't like that, okay, but it's really rolled out that way as well.
[00:48:10.315 --> 00:48:17.497]  Remember when we talked to Nigel Farage, and he pointed out that the morning of, they were telling everybody, no, no, no, no chance that Brexit's going to win.
[00:48:17.897 --> 00:48:24.200]  The morning of Brexit, even as they're voting, they had the premier polling organization in the United Kingdom.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:29.182]  Telling everybody that Leave was going to lose by 10 points.
[00:48:29.902 --> 00:48:40.326]  And that's what we have seen all night from the American mainstream establishment, from the globalists, and you can see them in total despair if you look at the markets around the world.
[00:48:40.366 --> 00:48:40.646]  But look,
[00:48:41.266 --> 00:48:42.927]  This isn't going to be the end of trade.
[00:48:43.127 --> 00:48:45.168]  It's not going to be a global trade war.
[00:48:45.649 --> 00:48:59.137]  What we're going to do is we're going to have different countries operating in their citizens' interests rather than everyone being controlled by a small globalist cabal that runs the TPP, the TTIP.
[00:48:59.497 --> 00:49:04.660]  But we have to watch out because things like that, I think Alex asked, what's going to happen now?
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.201]  How's the empire going to strike back?
[00:49:06.721 --> 00:49:11.623]  I think we're going to see a big push to try to replace Scalia and the lame duck session that is here.
[00:49:11.683 --> 00:49:21.588]  I think we're going to see a big push for these trade treaties to try to ram them through and we're going to see some other things that are going to happen with executive orders but I think that Donald Trump will reverse those once he gets in.
[00:49:22.048 --> 00:49:26.931]  I agree with you but one thing we could expect to see as well, unfortunately, is civil unrest.
[00:49:27.151 --> 00:49:27.311]  Yes.
[00:49:27.751 --> 00:49:39.318]  Who knows what's going to go on in Chicago, back in Ferguson, you know, by the time we wake up tomorrow morning, first thing I'm going to, you know, turn on the television, social media, let's hope everything's alright.
[00:49:39.498 --> 00:49:51.585]  Financial markets are going to try to make it difficult and we're going to see, I think it's coming up in December, the next time that the Federal Reserve visits the interest rates, I think they're going to raise interest rates to try to take down the economy, to try to punish us.
[00:49:51.665 --> 00:49:54.327]  And blame Donald Trump, absolutely.
[00:49:54.827 --> 00:49:57.250]  And it was similar to what we saw with the Brexit.
[00:49:57.350 --> 00:50:04.356]  Judges already calling it for Trump and also I just tweeted out pictures from inside Hillary Clinton's celebration area.
[00:50:04.677 --> 00:50:07.319]  And it's nothing but people filled with tears.
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:10.562]  As she literally hit the glass ceiling of the Javits Center.
[00:50:10.623 --> 00:50:13.105]  And it's all the campaign workers crying.
[00:50:14.426 --> 00:50:15.427]  Just so sad.
[00:50:16.327 --> 00:50:17.367]  It's called Schadenfreude.
[00:50:17.387 --> 00:50:18.888]  You know, guys, I don't know.
[00:50:18.988 --> 00:50:22.230]  I don't know if we're going to see the civil unrest we thought because it's such a landslide.
[00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:22.570]  I don't know.
[00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:23.030]  We'll see.
[00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:23.370]  We'll see.
[00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:23.970]  I hope not.
[00:50:24.531 --> 00:50:26.812]  I'm feeling like really good, really positive energy about this.
[00:50:27.072 --> 00:50:31.974]  But just like we saw with the Brexit, as soon as it looked like Trump was going to win, what was the news that was breaking?
[00:50:32.014 --> 00:50:32.795]  What was everybody talking about?
[00:50:33.095 --> 00:50:35.436]  Stocks down, market down, economy collapsing.
[00:50:35.636 --> 00:50:37.557]  That's exactly what they did with the Brexit.
[00:50:37.817 --> 00:50:39.478]  And now, months later, what's going on?
[00:50:39.718 --> 00:50:41.018]  The Brexit markets are up.
[00:50:41.178 --> 00:50:42.439]  The economy is growing.
[00:50:42.619 --> 00:50:47.922]  So the mainstream media continues to lie, even when their lies have failed right in front of the American public.
[00:50:48.123 --> 00:50:49.603]  And nobody's buying their crap anymore.
[00:50:49.623 --> 00:50:50.484]  That's right.
[00:50:50.544 --> 00:50:51.164]  They pushed it down.
[00:50:51.985 --> 00:50:53.366]  Oh, they're definitely going to fight back, though.
[00:50:53.406 --> 00:50:55.948]  I mean, we're already seeing that happen in the UK.
[00:50:56.648 --> 00:51:01.291]  We see them pushing back, trying to shut down the referendum that was approved by Parliament.
[00:51:01.431 --> 00:51:03.993]  So Drudge and Alex have both said it's over.
[00:51:04.013 --> 00:51:07.735]  Matt Drudge and Alex Jones have both said Trump is over.
[00:51:09.296 --> 00:51:10.517]  There's sites acting weird now.
[00:51:12.578 --> 00:51:15.721]  It says Trump wins, the American people have spoken.
[00:51:15.741 --> 00:51:17.502]  That's one of the top, you guys can probably pull it up.
[00:51:17.902 --> 00:51:22.406]  Yeah, Trump wins in historic uprising is the first story on the top left.
[00:51:22.586 --> 00:51:24.448]  Let the people rule is the headline.
[00:51:24.488 --> 00:51:24.988]  Here's my headline.
[00:51:25.368 --> 00:51:28.271]  Donald Trump, president over Janet Reno's dead body.
[00:51:31.054 --> 00:51:32.475]  Headline!
[00:51:32.555 --> 00:51:33.556]  Headline!
[00:51:33.636 --> 00:51:35.398]  Trump the establishment!
[00:51:35.578 --> 00:51:37.359]  Trump the establishment!
[00:51:37.479 --> 00:51:39.441]  Trump the establishment!
[00:51:39.461 --> 00:51:42.704]  Janet Reno died yesterday and Hillary Clinton politically died today.
[00:51:42.724 --> 00:51:43.264]  This is great.
[00:51:43.304 --> 00:51:44.765]  And the Democrats might be dead!
[00:51:45.065 --> 00:51:47.167]  This might be the death of the Democratic Party!
[00:51:47.187 --> 00:51:47.788]  Holy mother!
[00:51:48.427 --> 00:51:48.647]  Yeah.
[00:51:49.268 --> 00:51:53.971]  Yeah, I can just see Hillary Clinton's toes curling up in those striped socks underneath the house right now.
[00:51:53.991 --> 00:51:54.491]  Oh, yes!
[00:51:55.732 --> 00:52:00.795]  But think about how significant this was, or this is, what we're experiencing right now.
[00:52:01.035 --> 00:52:08.701]  This, I believe, deep in my heart, that this was the last time, our last chance, to save the republic.
[00:52:08.721 --> 00:52:09.041]  I agree.
[00:52:09.301 --> 00:52:11.262]  We should be reading Hollywood's tweets right now.
[00:52:11.502 --> 00:52:13.964]  We have set back the globalists 50 years, Margaret.
[00:52:14.765 --> 00:52:16.646]  50 years of questions on the edge of a knife.
[00:52:16.826 --> 00:52:18.507]  The Xanax is off the charts.
[00:52:18.968 --> 00:52:20.349]  Hollywood freaks out.
[00:52:20.489 --> 00:52:23.872]  Apparently they're all barfing in their sports bar right now.
[00:52:23.952 --> 00:52:26.274]  Because here's what they were told.
[00:52:26.494 --> 00:52:28.936]  They were told, go for Hillary.
[00:52:29.416 --> 00:52:30.217]  Say you'll move.
[00:52:30.257 --> 00:52:31.057]  Do all this stuff.
[00:52:31.077 --> 00:52:32.098]  You won't look like an idiot.
[00:52:32.138 --> 00:52:32.919]  We rigged it.
[00:52:32.979 --> 00:52:34.560]  But you do look like an idiot.
[00:52:42.904 --> 00:52:47.167]  That's the way you need it.
[00:52:47.407 --> 00:52:49.009]  Like you said, we blow up the Death Star.
[00:52:49.609 --> 00:52:50.590]  It's the next phase of the fight.
[00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:51.711]  Me and Roger are about to come in.
[00:52:52.031 --> 00:52:52.932]  He's talking to the Trump folks.
[00:52:52.952 --> 00:52:54.033]  We're seeing what's happening right now.
[00:52:54.153 --> 00:52:56.655]  This is a total repudiation of evil.
[00:52:57.596 --> 00:52:59.238]  Power always believes it's invincible.
[00:52:59.538 --> 00:53:00.819]  There's only one more stage of the fight.
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:03.181]  Celebration to everybody, folks.
[00:53:03.201 --> 00:53:03.902]  That's all I can say.
[00:53:03.922 --> 00:53:04.322]  That's right.
[00:53:04.642 --> 00:53:05.043]  That's right.
[00:53:05.303 --> 00:53:06.124]  We got fireworks.
[00:53:06.824 --> 00:53:08.625]  We need confetti in here.
[00:53:09.445 --> 00:53:10.645]  Where's Walker with the graphics?
[00:53:10.745 --> 00:53:13.526]  I wish Hillary hadn't cancelled those fireworks now.
[00:53:17.128 --> 00:53:23.350]  Hey, how many news anchors have a cigar in right now and an AR pistol in their hand right now?
[00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:25.050]  You don't see Megyn Kelly with that right now, Roger.
[00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:32.733]  Alright, we don't have any fireworks, but maybe we can get video tape of that Tesla car that crashed and burned and then went off the sparklers and everything.
[00:53:32.753 --> 00:53:35.114]  That's as close to fireworks as we're going to get this week.
[00:53:35.294 --> 00:53:36.154]  Tesla car crash.
[00:53:39.065 --> 00:53:41.307]  I tell you what, I feel good.
[00:53:41.327 --> 00:53:42.347]  Wow.
[00:53:42.687 --> 00:53:43.668]  I'm so excited.
[00:53:43.888 --> 00:53:44.749]  I just can't hide it.
[00:53:44.809 --> 00:53:46.330]  I'm about to lose control.
[00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:47.551]  We had two songs picked.
[00:53:47.591 --> 00:53:52.073]  Big Brain and I went to the store earlier and he goes, I got two songs picked for tonight.
[00:53:52.093 --> 00:53:54.955]  And he's like, one is, what was the one you said?
[00:53:54.995 --> 00:53:55.456]  Cool in the Gang.
[00:53:55.476 --> 00:53:56.436]  Celebrate good times.
[00:53:56.877 --> 00:53:59.198]  And then the other one was Taps.
[00:53:59.238 --> 00:54:02.700]  He looked at me and he goes, I hope we don't have to play Taps.
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:04.361]  And I go, I hope we don't either.
[00:54:05.502 --> 00:54:07.624]  Luckily, we're not playing taps.
[00:54:07.764 --> 00:54:16.011]  You know, when you first started, because I monitor the mainstream media coverage, and when I first started watching this evening, it was all negative Trump.
[00:54:16.691 --> 00:54:17.752]  Hillary was looking good.
[00:54:17.952 --> 00:54:20.454]  Just like the New York Times, what did they say this morning?
[00:54:20.474 --> 00:54:24.858]  87% chance, something like that, that Hillary was going to win?
[00:54:24.878 --> 00:54:26.839]  And it flipped just like that.
[00:54:26.859 --> 00:54:28.901]  Diehard cover-trumper pollster, man.
[00:54:28.961 --> 00:54:31.083]  He is the court jester.
[00:54:31.743 --> 00:54:35.585]  Okay, Nate Silver, the court jester for the never-Trump court.
[00:54:35.685 --> 00:54:37.206]  This is bigger than Ronald Reagan, man.
[00:54:37.246 --> 00:54:38.626]  This is bigger than Ronald Reagan.
[00:54:38.906 --> 00:54:42.388]  And Ronald Reagan was behind in the polls, like nine points a week.
[00:54:42.488 --> 00:54:45.529]  And it's bigger than Ronald Reagan, not only in magnitude.
[00:54:45.649 --> 00:54:46.710]  There we go, there's the death star.
[00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:54.595]  Bigger than Ronald Reagan, not only because of the magnitude, but because Donald Trump got zero pennies.
[00:54:55.015 --> 00:54:56.576]  Not even dollars, but pennies.
[00:54:56.616 --> 00:55:01.059]  Not one red cent was spent on political ads for Donald Trump by the RNC.
[00:55:01.079 --> 00:55:05.803]  And that was a $50 million contribution to Hillary Clinton by the RNC.
[00:55:06.163 --> 00:55:13.328]  Because they would have, by not spending that money, if you really want to know what that is, you've got the RNC, people like Paul Ryanow,
[00:55:13.928 --> 00:55:15.009]  Contributing to Hillary Clinton.
[00:55:15.029 --> 00:55:16.570]  Now, Donald Trump will use him.
[00:55:16.610 --> 00:55:17.611]  He knows how to negotiate.
[00:55:17.631 --> 00:55:18.332]  He's an adult.
[00:55:18.672 --> 00:55:19.513]  He'll get beyond this.
[00:55:19.573 --> 00:55:22.335]  But look, he doesn't owe the GOP establishment anything.
[00:55:22.776 --> 00:55:25.218]  And neither do the American people.
[00:55:25.778 --> 00:55:34.706]  They have lied to us repeatedly, telling us that they're going to take care of Obamacare, of the open borders, of the issues that we're pressing to the American people.
[00:55:35.026 --> 00:55:41.612]  And that's why the Americans turned out in massive numbers for Donald Trump, because we're sick and tired.
[00:55:42.092 --> 00:55:44.354]  Of the establishment Republican and Democrat.
[00:55:44.594 --> 00:55:47.816]  He was the true third party independent, not Gary Johnson.
[00:55:48.276 --> 00:55:51.198]  And oh, we're talking about Gary Johnson, another big loser, okay?
[00:55:51.218 --> 00:55:54.080]  There you go, add him to the list.
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:57.142]  2% or whatever, which is a big number for the Libertarians, but guess what?
[00:55:57.582 --> 00:56:01.585]  It doesn't get him on the welfare tit of the state, which is what they wanted.
[00:56:01.625 --> 00:56:02.005]  They wanted 5%.
[00:56:02.605 --> 00:56:06.448]  That's why they sold their principles like a bunch of prostitutes.
[00:56:07.248 --> 00:56:12.192]  For that little bit, that 30 pieces of silver the Libertarian Party sold out.
[00:56:12.252 --> 00:56:13.953]  So maybe they're happy with what they got.
[00:56:14.313 --> 00:56:15.714]  They lost their integrity.
[00:56:16.195 --> 00:56:17.656]  They lost everything, in my opinion.
[00:56:17.756 --> 00:56:18.456]  I'm confused.
[00:56:18.496 --> 00:56:20.298]  We're not going to war with Russia, folks.
[00:56:20.578 --> 00:56:21.458]  Isn't this good news?
[00:56:21.639 --> 00:56:24.701]  We're not going to war with Russia.
[00:56:24.721 --> 00:56:27.603]  We've still got a month and a half or two left of Obama.
[00:56:27.863 --> 00:56:30.945]  Let's look at the trending things on Twitter right now.
[00:56:31.566 --> 00:56:33.087]  United States of anxiety.
[00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:38.072]  America is over party.
[00:56:39.553 --> 00:56:40.414]  Come on, really?
[00:56:40.434 --> 00:56:43.676]  America has now been vindicated.
[00:56:43.997 --> 00:56:46.058]  The American people have now been heard.
[00:56:46.459 --> 00:56:50.202]  We have taken over everything using social media.
[00:56:50.542 --> 00:56:54.265]  We have completely transformed the narrative.
[00:56:55.086 --> 00:56:58.609]  We were told for so many years, you know, that what to do, what to think.
[00:56:59.189 --> 00:57:02.792]  You know, these devices, like I was telling Roger Stone, these cell phones were created
[00:57:03.775 --> 00:57:09.958]  Essentially, so we could get information that was propaganda to make us think a certain way to manipulate us.
[00:57:10.058 --> 00:57:22.043]  And instead, we took these devices, and we took their accounts, we took their Facebook that is leaning to the left, we took their Twitter that leans to the left, and we threw it back, we turned it around, put it in their face, and we still kicked their butt with it.
[00:57:22.503 --> 00:57:23.364]  Like the internet itself.
[00:57:23.384 --> 00:57:25.325]  It was created by DARPA to try to control us.
[00:57:25.365 --> 00:57:34.932]  It was created by Licklider, a guy who was a psychiatrist and he wanted to create public opinion and instead we use it as a tool of freedom.
[00:57:35.212 --> 00:57:37.394]  Hey look, another winner is Brexit.
[00:57:37.594 --> 00:57:38.595]  And let me point out that
[00:57:39.534 --> 00:57:44.398]  Britain stood alone against the globalists, just like they stood alone against Hitler, okay?
[00:57:44.418 --> 00:57:45.199]  The Battle of Britain.
[00:57:45.559 --> 00:57:50.824]  And now America has come into the fight, just like in World War II, on the side of the Brits.
[00:57:51.304 --> 00:58:00.051]  Hey guys, right now, the live New York Times results are predicting 300 electoral votes for Donald Trump.
[00:58:00.432 --> 00:58:02.794]  That is an absolute butt-kicking.
[00:58:03.314 --> 00:58:12.243]  Pennsylvania is at 48.2 per candidate, and in Michigan, Trump holds a slight lead with 47.9% to her 46.9%.
[00:58:12.763 --> 00:58:20.731]  And I was just going to say, make sure we go to Trump live when he makes his victory speech.
[00:58:20.811 --> 00:58:21.552]  We want to see that.
[00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:23.810]  That's right.
[00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:24.310]  Look at that.
[00:58:24.911 --> 00:58:25.291]  Wow.
[00:58:25.571 --> 00:58:25.951]  Wow.
[00:58:26.211 --> 00:58:26.572]  Wow.
[00:58:26.632 --> 00:58:27.012]  Shocking.
[00:58:27.032 --> 00:58:27.892]  It's surreal, isn't it?
[00:58:27.912 --> 00:58:28.873]  Yeah.
[00:58:28.893 --> 00:58:29.793]  I still... man.
[00:58:30.294 --> 00:58:30.914]  But you know what?
[00:58:31.114 --> 00:58:31.814]  This is beautiful.
[00:58:32.074 --> 00:58:43.380]  We knew that this would be the result, you know, just because we live in reality and we have common sense, but we were worried that they would steal it, but we knew a landslide could trump the steal, and that's what we're seeing tonight.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:44.381]  That's right.
[00:58:45.256 --> 00:58:48.779]  And you know, even though California went to Hillary.
[00:58:48.799 --> 00:58:49.900]  Well that's the superdelegate.
[00:58:50.161 --> 00:58:56.326]  I could say that all my buddies and my crew in California, they voted for Trump and they are damn happy right now.
[00:58:56.367 --> 00:58:58.689]  And I know they're partying in Mentone, USA.
[00:58:58.769 --> 00:59:00.030]  Yeah!
[00:59:00.290 --> 00:59:02.052]  I mean, it's still up there.
[00:59:02.092 --> 00:59:03.754]  I mean, New Hampshire is dead even, 47%.
[00:59:03.854 --> 00:59:04.975]  Pennsylvania, still dead even at 48.2%.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:13.921]  Michigan, 47.9 and 46.9.
[00:59:15.802 --> 00:59:17.442]  Minnesota looks like Clinton will win.
[00:59:17.842 --> 00:59:19.683]  Arizona looks like Trump will win.
[00:59:19.703 --> 00:59:20.343]  That's good.
[00:59:21.043 --> 00:59:25.665]  But Maine is for Clinton, so we've got to get this, man.
[00:59:25.685 --> 00:59:26.345]  We've got to.
[00:59:27.746 --> 00:59:28.526]  It's still not over.
[00:59:28.566 --> 00:59:30.807]  So we might be jumping the gun a little bit.
[00:59:30.867 --> 00:59:31.707]  It's still not over.
[00:59:31.767 --> 00:59:32.327]  It's close.
[00:59:32.387 --> 00:59:34.128]  I mean, but there's still a great chance we can win this.
[00:59:35.765 --> 00:59:43.008]  I just want everybody to just understand that there's a path to victory still based off this map for both candidates.
[00:59:43.688 --> 00:59:45.929]  We're talking about winners and losers.
[00:59:46.249 --> 00:59:52.111]  I think we also got to throw into the mix the whistleblowers within the intelligence communities.
[00:59:52.772 --> 01:00:01.615]  And we're talking about William Benny from the NSA and of course everybody that stole emails and it wasn't Russia.
[01:00:01.835 --> 01:00:07.639]  Okay, it was whistleblowers within our own intelligence agencies that gave WikiLeaks the email.
[01:00:07.719 --> 01:00:09.020]  So, big winners.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:09.960]  That's right.
[01:00:10.241 --> 01:00:20.928]  WikiLeaks, Drudge, Breitbart, InfoWars, every single person here at InfoWars, and of course the army of InfoWarriors out there that have helped us get through this thing.
[01:00:21.068 --> 01:00:22.149]  Don't forget Pepe.
[01:00:22.209 --> 01:00:23.469]  Yeah, the audience.
[01:00:23.509 --> 01:00:24.070]  And Pepe.
[01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:25.911]  It was really them, Darren, that's right.
[01:00:26.111 --> 01:00:26.972]  Pepe's a big winner.
[01:00:28.012 --> 01:00:29.513]  But not the guy who created him.
[01:00:29.553 --> 01:00:31.954]  The guy who created him is Salah Taylori.
[01:00:31.994 --> 01:00:33.514]  But Pepe's winning.
[01:00:36.015 --> 01:00:38.036]  Well, we should try to go to a commercial break really quick.
[01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:46.265]  Take a break and come back in a few minutes and break down the rest of these states.
[01:00:46.885 --> 01:00:49.026]  Almost ready to make it official, folks.
[01:00:49.626 --> 01:00:50.226]  Almost ready.
[01:00:51.027 --> 01:00:51.427]  I'm ready.
[01:00:51.987 --> 01:00:57.810]  I think once they finally tabulate Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, I think we'll know.
[01:00:58.470 --> 01:01:01.132]  Because if Trump takes either one of those two,
[01:01:01.972 --> 01:01:02.532]  I think it's over.
[01:01:02.552 --> 01:01:03.253]  Michigan is over.
[01:01:04.474 --> 01:01:05.795]  Trump's only down by 16.
[01:01:06.115 --> 01:01:06.695]  Michigan is 16.
[01:01:07.336 --> 01:01:09.197]  So that puts us at the mark right there.
[01:01:09.937 --> 01:01:10.498]  Dead even.
[01:01:10.738 --> 01:01:16.842]  I mean, even if you give Clinton New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, I still think Trump has the path to victory with 285.
[01:01:17.442 --> 01:01:18.423]  And that's being conservative.
[01:01:20.165 --> 01:01:21.706]  Well, we're waiting for the official announcement.
[01:01:21.806 --> 01:01:22.107]  Right.
[01:01:22.147 --> 01:01:24.489]  Let's understand that, you know, he's won.
[01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:25.670]  We understand that.
[01:01:26.110 --> 01:01:29.974]  They are chanting, lock her up right now at the Trump campaign.
[01:01:29.994 --> 01:01:31.415]  Lock her up being chanted.
[01:01:31.435 --> 01:01:39.962]  Trump is not going to make an official announcement until the networks or the services or whatever will make that final call.
[01:01:39.983 --> 01:01:41.784]  But we can take a look at the statistics.
[01:01:41.824 --> 01:01:42.945]  We know how this is going down.
[01:01:43.285 --> 01:01:47.029]  And even they are projecting that's what's going to happen even though they haven't made the official call.
[01:01:47.609 --> 01:01:51.250]  I think we can take a break and we can come back in just a couple of moments.
[01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:52.530]  Let's take a quick commercial break.
[01:01:55.871 --> 01:02:02.693]  All right, well... We're living history right now and I'm waiting for... It must be popping the champagne in the control room.
[01:02:05.254 --> 01:02:07.054]  I mean, just, oh my gosh.
[01:02:07.214 --> 01:02:08.115]  Are we seeing this?
[01:02:08.135 --> 01:02:09.335]  Are we really seeing this?
[01:02:10.134 --> 01:02:11.696]  It was just a matter of time for me.
[01:02:11.896 --> 01:02:14.419]  I've been predicting a Trump landslide for a long time.
[01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:17.263]  The only concern was the rigged votes.
[01:02:17.383 --> 01:02:17.904]  And you know what?
[01:02:17.944 --> 01:02:18.484]  Here's the thing.
[01:02:19.471 --> 01:02:25.473]  We might have people that come at us saying, oh well, you were conspiracy theorists, you thought they'd rig it, this, that, or the other thing.
[01:02:25.793 --> 01:02:36.617]  No, folks, because we called it out, because we reported on it, because we brought attention to it, because you, the people out there, were actually being vigilant in this election, they could not do that.
[01:02:37.017 --> 01:02:44.140]  We had the optics, we knew what was going on, so don't try to listen to this bullcrap like, oh well, look at you, you look stupid, you thought that they would rig it.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:49.183]  No, because we were vigilant, because we cared, because we paid attention, they couldn't rig it.
[01:02:49.203 --> 01:02:51.065]  That's another victory over the establishment.
[01:02:51.185 --> 01:02:51.625]  That's right.
[01:02:51.945 --> 01:02:54.587]  You and I talked about this last night, and it was really, really late.
[01:02:54.627 --> 01:02:57.589]  The WikiLeaks revelations you got on these fantastic guests.
[01:02:57.889 --> 01:03:01.151]  Can you imagine the indictments that are about to be, the investigations?
[01:03:01.171 --> 01:03:05.955]  We're actually going to have a DOJ and an FBI that work, for once, for the American people.
[01:03:06.295 --> 01:03:09.657]  They're not covering the tales of the criminals any longer.
[01:03:09.757 --> 01:03:11.899]  I mean, this is just... Yeah, isn't that the thing, Margaret?
[01:03:12.339 --> 01:03:19.966]  Imagine if we had a president that held the FBI, the Justice Department, Homeland Security, that held all of these agencies accountable.
[01:03:20.326 --> 01:03:31.297]  I forget exactly what Donald Trump said, but basically he said, I am not going to stand for any agencies that do not answer to the American people, that do not uphold their oath to the Constitution.
[01:03:31.557 --> 01:03:32.217]  And I'm sorry.
[01:03:33.018 --> 01:03:35.059]  That right there is a drastic change, folks.
[01:03:35.119 --> 01:03:35.600]  I cannot wait.
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:45.925]  Those two little podestas, those wicked men from hell, I cannot wait to see them running with their nasty little artwork on their backs, fleeing the country because they're under indictment, both of them.
[01:03:45.945 --> 01:03:53.269]  You know, I think the WikiLeaks that we covered yesterday, specifically those two men, you know, if this happens, he is going to drain the swamp.
[01:03:53.389 --> 01:03:54.270]  I believe that.
[01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:57.812]  You know, these cronies that are criminals, those two in particular, the
[01:03:57.892 --> 01:03:59.213]  Well, the swamp might drain itself.
[01:03:59.273 --> 01:04:02.297]  They might get scared and go running towards the hills.
[01:04:02.337 --> 01:04:02.937]  They better run.
[01:04:02.957 --> 01:04:04.379]  They better run.
[01:04:04.399 --> 01:04:09.804]  We covered all the media celebrities in Hollywood and the music industry that want to leave the country.
[01:04:10.165 --> 01:04:16.211]  Well, some of these Washington establishment corrupt bureaucrats might be heading to the hills and leaving the country too soon.
[01:04:16.691 --> 01:04:21.234]  And McAuliffe included, you know, the provisional ballots that he stocked in Virginia.
[01:04:21.294 --> 01:04:22.755]  A million provisional ballots.
[01:04:23.095 --> 01:04:25.557]  Never in history had anybody ever done that.
[01:04:25.577 --> 01:04:27.218]  You talk about desperate?
[01:04:27.718 --> 01:04:32.221]  I mean, a career criminal in collusion with the Chinese, you know, under investigation from the FBI.
[01:04:32.521 --> 01:04:36.524]  With his involvement, you know, that little car company that he has in Memphis that hasn't made a single car.
[01:04:36.844 --> 01:04:37.725]  And he's next too!
[01:04:38.345 --> 01:04:39.907]  Put him on the list, honestly.
[01:04:40.308 --> 01:04:41.710]  I remember the mainstream news.
[01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:51.883]  I remember the Clinton campaign when we first started getting these reports about how all this new voter turnout, there's record numbers at the polls, more people voting than ever.
[01:04:52.224 --> 01:04:53.566]  The Clinton campaign was excited.
[01:04:53.586 --> 01:04:55.408]  They tried to claim that that was their momentum.
[01:04:56.129 --> 01:05:00.233]  Hey, Hillary, you ran a presidential campaign before you failed, okay?
[01:05:00.273 --> 01:05:01.834]  That's not your movement.
[01:05:01.854 --> 01:05:09.621]  We knew that the whole time, and so when you see all the pictures, when you see this history, folks, this was the American people coming out for Donald Trump.
[01:05:09.641 --> 01:05:11.242]  This is a real movement.
[01:05:11.302 --> 01:05:14.845]  Yes, Donald Trump is obviously the man at the head of this movement, but
[01:05:15.686 --> 01:05:23.950]  We, the people, are the water in the ocean, the wave that have carried Donald Trump, the man on the surfboard, to this great victory.
[01:05:24.270 --> 01:05:26.652]  We are the ones that he's riding to this great victory.
[01:05:26.672 --> 01:05:27.392]  It's the American people.
[01:05:27.412 --> 01:05:28.272]  You're absolutely right.
[01:05:29.953 --> 01:05:32.654]  That's where the credit lies here, because you know what?
[01:05:32.755 --> 01:05:35.436]  Honestly, and we're in love with the guy.
[01:05:35.596 --> 01:05:35.876]  We are.
[01:05:35.896 --> 01:05:36.596]  We just are.
[01:05:36.897 --> 01:05:41.419]  But it's the American people who finally stood up and said, enough is enough is enough.
[01:05:41.719 --> 01:05:42.920]  Let me ask you a question, Margaret.
[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:43.420]  Yes.
[01:05:44.366 --> 01:05:55.151]  Now, I was at, you know, family Thanksgivings last year, family Christmases, and I told my friends and family, well, you know, not much avid Clinton supporters, but didn't like Trump.
[01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:55.451]  Right.
[01:05:57.219 --> 01:06:00.681]  It was a different, totally different narrative even last November and December.
[01:06:00.701 --> 01:06:02.403]  I mean, Trump was still, could never win.
[01:06:02.463 --> 01:06:03.724]  Trump was still a joke candidate.
[01:06:03.864 --> 01:06:05.405]  You know, the primaries were still going on.
[01:06:05.445 --> 01:06:07.626]  Trump didn't have a chance still in November and December last year.
[01:06:08.227 --> 01:06:16.593]  And I remember talking to friends and family at that time who thought I was crazy for supporting Trump, not just because, you know, he's crazy like the media built him up to be, but because he didn't have a chance.
[01:06:16.653 --> 01:06:17.673]  Didn't have a chance, didn't have a chance.
[01:06:17.953 --> 01:06:21.116]  And I told you, I'll see you in a year and Donald Trump will be the president.
[01:06:21.136 --> 01:06:22.216]  And it looks like that's going to be the case.
[01:06:22.617 --> 01:06:25.058]  And on top of that, I had friends who
[01:06:25.979 --> 01:06:27.640]  Really weren't interested in politics.
[01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:29.761]  You know, maybe they were going to vote, maybe they weren't going to vote.
[01:06:29.801 --> 01:06:31.702]  Weren't really following it, didn't really care that much.
[01:06:31.762 --> 01:06:34.744]  But you know, they're patriots and they probably were going to have a vote.
[01:06:34.764 --> 01:06:35.404]  They know what's going on.
[01:06:35.444 --> 01:06:36.124]  They know who's running.
[01:06:36.165 --> 01:06:41.287]  But all of a sudden, in the last week, these people started texting me, blowing me up.
[01:06:41.347 --> 01:06:41.988]  Go Trump, go!
[01:06:42.828 --> 01:06:45.630]  Just months ago, they didn't care about Trump.
[01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:46.970]  They weren't going to vote for Trump.
[01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:48.151]  They really didn't even like Trump.
[01:06:48.611 --> 01:06:51.953]  And now here we are today, they're all excited because they got on the train.
[01:06:51.993 --> 01:06:53.454]  They've felt this positive energy.
[01:06:53.474 --> 01:06:58.357]  They've been a part of this movement and now they are a part of history and nothing can take that away from them.
[01:06:58.397 --> 01:07:02.199]  They saw the light and I think that this is why Trump is winning in a landslide.
[01:07:02.239 --> 01:07:06.962]  I know it's not over yet, but this is truly, we could be looking at a historic landslide.
[01:07:07.267 --> 01:07:08.808]  Detox is a process.
[01:07:09.049 --> 01:07:09.729]  I mean, I get that.
[01:07:11.451 --> 01:07:13.533]  Intellectual detox is a process for some people.
[01:07:13.573 --> 01:07:16.155]  And it's not to discredit people who didn't support Trump, you know.
[01:07:16.575 --> 01:07:17.736]  It's a process for them.
[01:07:17.776 --> 01:07:22.661]  And I commend you for giving that example because, you know, we need to bring people into the fold.
[01:07:22.701 --> 01:07:27.405]  Now's the time to do that because we've got a deeply divided nation at the moment.
[01:07:27.425 --> 01:07:29.266]  There's going to be healing that's required.
[01:07:29.306 --> 01:07:29.887]  There is.
[01:07:29.967 --> 01:07:32.109]  Well, you talk about bringing people into the fold.
[01:07:32.129 --> 01:07:33.010]  They need to be brought in.
[01:07:33.030 --> 01:07:34.231]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:07:34.491 --> 01:07:38.834]  And Donald Trump already did that with his charisma, with this movement, with his campaign.
[01:07:39.575 --> 01:07:46.940]  And now what you're seeing is because it's cool, because it's successful, I mean this is populism, people are jumping on board.
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:52.544]  Right, I'm talking about the people that are in middle America, you know, they don't really have their finger on the pulse.
[01:07:52.584 --> 01:07:53.024]  It's the bandwagon.
[01:07:53.105 --> 01:07:53.725]  Right, exactly.
[01:07:53.745 --> 01:07:55.987]  It's frontrunners, bandwagoners, and that's fine.
[01:07:56.627 --> 01:08:05.591]  And it's like, it's like when the, you know, when the team wins the World Series they get, or the Super Bowl or whatever, they become the most popular team in the league, their merchandise sells out, everybody is a fan of them now.
[01:08:06.151 --> 01:08:07.172]  That's what Donald Trump is.
[01:08:07.472 --> 01:08:19.757]  The people who were in the middle, the people who were never politically involved, the people who never really cared much about politics, are now bandwagoning, they're hopping in, and they're on the Trump train, it's fun, and Joe Biggs is coming in here.
[01:08:19.897 --> 01:08:20.678]  What do you got?
[01:08:20.698 --> 01:08:23.259]  You got some... Come here, come here Joe.
[01:08:23.559 --> 01:08:26.943]  I'm just saying this, look, it's not over yet, but it's over.
[01:08:27.003 --> 01:08:28.325]  And I don't know what's going to happen yet.
[01:08:28.685 --> 01:08:29.506]  I'm so excited.
[01:08:30.227 --> 01:08:33.791]  You know, I want to rip my clothes off and scream and run in the streets.
[01:08:34.191 --> 01:08:41.299]  I want to be vindicated for everything, all the hard work, the not sleeping, the being shot at and all these freaking riots.
[01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:42.681]  All this, man.
[01:08:42.721 --> 01:08:43.562]  Everything we've gone through.
[01:08:43.602 --> 01:08:45.163]  Blood, sweat, and tears, man.
[01:08:45.243 --> 01:08:47.305]  Just traveling around non-stop.
[01:08:47.685 --> 01:08:49.087]  You know, it's been hard.
[01:08:49.567 --> 01:08:53.871]  As a veteran, you know, and you know about what's happened in the past with the U.S.
[01:08:53.911 --> 01:08:54.452]  military.
[01:08:54.712 --> 01:08:56.593]  You've seen what's happening currently with the VA.
[01:08:56.614 --> 01:08:58.735]  You know, this is something that probably troubled you.
[01:08:58.776 --> 01:09:01.458]  Do you feel like a little hope for this now with Donald Trump in?
[01:09:02.959 --> 01:09:03.280]  You know,
[01:09:04.491 --> 01:09:12.556]  I haven't heard Hillary say much of anything about veterans other than her trying to pin this whole con job saying that Trump said stuff about Gold Star families.
[01:09:13.076 --> 01:09:16.658]  First of all, the family has nothing to do with service.
[01:09:17.039 --> 01:09:19.140]  You're the parents of someone who was honorable.
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:28.443]  You, the parent, the father was a con job and you exploited what your son did to use as a pawn for Hillary Clinton to try to attack Donald Trump.
[01:09:28.723 --> 01:09:35.026]  Donald Trump actually gives a crap about veterans because he actually, what most people don't know about Trump,
[01:09:35.786 --> 01:09:42.928]  And, uh, when he goes to these different states, like Wisconsin, for instance, or whatever, when we were there, before he goes to his scheduled events, you know what he does?
[01:09:43.288 --> 01:09:53.090]  He privately meets with veteran groups in almost every state he goes to, and meets them, and sits down with them one-on-one, and he meets them, and shakes their hand, and goes, what's going on?
[01:09:53.150 --> 01:09:54.111]  What can we do to fix it?
[01:09:54.131 --> 01:09:55.951]  That's something that doesn't get reported a lot.
[01:09:56.451 --> 01:09:59.412]  You know, so as a veteran, I actually see him giving an F about me.
[01:09:59.912 --> 01:10:09.034]  You know, the fact that I can't get the surgery I need for my knee, that I have a torn ACL since September 26, 2006, at the Samar Bypass in Iraq.
[01:10:09.514 --> 01:10:11.334]  You know, that's something I've been trying to get done for a long time.
[01:10:11.355 --> 01:10:11.675]  It's despicable.
[01:10:11.695 --> 01:10:17.896]  We're talking about a veteran with a health issue who can't get health care, adequate health care, in a wealthy nation.
[01:10:17.916 --> 01:10:18.436]  That's really messed up.
[01:10:18.456 --> 01:10:20.857]  And under Obamacare too, when we were all supposed to get free health care.
[01:10:20.877 --> 01:10:21.277]  Seriously.
[01:10:21.337 --> 01:10:27.198]  And there's veterans every day coming out going, hey man, we're getting kicked off of the VA, they're putting us on Obamacare, but we can't afford it!
[01:10:27.558 --> 01:10:28.459]  We've covered cases.
[01:10:28.499 --> 01:10:31.160]  You and I talked about this case where the one veteran, he was so frustrated.
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:32.681]  He had so many issues.
[01:10:32.701 --> 01:10:34.562]  He lit himself on fire outside of the VA.
[01:10:34.582 --> 01:10:35.562]  Do you remember that story?
[01:10:35.582 --> 01:10:36.843]  This happened in March.
[01:10:36.863 --> 01:10:37.223]  That's right.
[01:10:37.243 --> 01:10:38.244]  I'm coming in one minute.
[01:10:38.264 --> 01:10:39.724]  You guys finish up.
[01:10:39.824 --> 01:10:41.605]  People are so desperate for care.
[01:10:41.805 --> 01:10:46.208]  They had to build a fence on the VA hospital to keep people from jumping off in Atlanta.
[01:10:46.248 --> 01:10:48.729]  And they came in for service and healthcare.
[01:10:48.889 --> 01:10:49.850]  Alex Jones about to go live.
[01:10:49.890 --> 01:10:52.431]  And let's not forget the major military endorsement that Donald Trump did.
[01:10:52.491 --> 01:10:57.053]  And members of the military came out and said the reason they endorsed Donald Trump because he wanted to work with them.
[01:10:57.334 --> 01:10:59.014]  He wanted to listen to them.
[01:10:59.134 --> 01:10:59.555]  Joe Biggs.
[01:11:00.195 --> 01:11:00.555]  Hey man.
[01:11:00.935 --> 01:11:01.836]  You know, I'm super excited.
[01:11:01.856 --> 01:11:03.077]  You ready to light these cigars?
[01:11:03.177 --> 01:11:03.637]  I'm ready.
[01:11:04.617 --> 01:11:05.458]  I'm telling you this right now.
[01:11:06.038 --> 01:11:07.539]  I am not a big fan of cigars.
[01:11:08.059 --> 01:11:10.781]  We've been talking about these cigars for all week.
[01:11:10.861 --> 01:11:15.264]  This is something that, for me, it's like the icing on the cake.
[01:11:15.324 --> 01:11:16.405]  It's the birthday candles.
[01:11:16.545 --> 01:11:17.165]  It's blowing out.
[01:11:17.185 --> 01:11:19.246]  The Death Star is clearing a fire in 10 seconds.
[01:11:19.487 --> 01:11:21.228]  You know, it's something I've been looking forward to.
[01:11:21.268 --> 01:11:25.450]  I mean, I'm telling you, I'm going to be emotional as hell if it happens.
[01:11:26.011 --> 01:11:27.011]  Oh man.
[01:11:27.071 --> 01:11:28.853]  I'm already, I got the rush, man.
[01:11:28.893 --> 01:11:35.097]  We're getting the Trump flags, we're getting in my big white truck, and we're driving through liberal Austin, and we're going to gloat, and we're going to have one hell of a time.
[01:11:37.608 --> 01:11:39.130]  We beat you, establishment!
[01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:42.753]  We trumped you!
[01:11:43.334 --> 01:11:45.936]  Trump the establishment!
[01:11:46.557 --> 01:11:48.959]  We have trumped the establishment tonight, folks.
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.181]  Unbelievable history.
[01:11:51.261 --> 01:11:52.062]  Great job, guys.
[01:11:52.082 --> 01:11:55.205]  Here's Donald Trump casting his ballots today, and we're about to give you the big announcement.
[01:11:55.625 --> 01:11:56.967]  Trump's getting ready to make the big announcement.
[01:11:57.007 --> 01:11:57.667]  He's dominating.
[01:11:58.128 --> 01:11:59.489]  It looks like it is a Trump victory.
[01:11:59.850 --> 01:12:00.951]  We're here to tell you this first.
[01:12:01.731 --> 01:12:03.252]  The enemy is in total disarray.
[01:12:03.272 --> 01:12:11.694]  A bunch of backstabbing cowards that robbed the nation our ancestors built, thought that everything was theirs because they conquered it.
[01:12:12.094 --> 01:12:12.694]  But they were wrong.
[01:12:12.754 --> 01:12:14.115]  Roger Stone's here with us.
[01:12:14.155 --> 01:12:15.535]  We'll come back to all the reporters as well.
[01:12:15.555 --> 01:12:19.116]  Getting ready for the big announcement that Trump's leaving Trump Tower to go make.
[01:12:19.136 --> 01:12:20.016]  We heard about an hour ago.
[01:12:20.476 --> 01:12:21.757]  Now it looks like he's getting ready to do it.
[01:12:21.797 --> 01:12:22.537]  Roger Stone's here.
[01:12:22.897 --> 01:12:25.738]  But first I want to air Donald Trump casting his ballot today.
[01:12:28.021 --> 01:12:39.366]  And then we will continue on with, I want to play this Trump Reads Letter from supporter Bill Belichick, because that shows just how we have the grassroots support that's taking place.
[01:12:39.386 --> 01:12:49.751]  And we have the media making jokes about all this, saying there's no such thing as election fraud, while they say the Russians have taken over.
[01:12:51.394 --> 01:12:52.415]  Looks like our computer's down.
[01:12:52.435 --> 01:12:53.236]  We won't have any clips tonight.
[01:12:53.276 --> 01:12:53.717]  That's fine.
[01:12:54.378 --> 01:12:58.303]  Roger Stone, we're at 11.45 Central here.
[01:12:59.504 --> 01:13:01.006]  And history has happened.
[01:13:01.026 --> 01:13:02.809]  People are tuning in by the millions.
[01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:04.551]  We need to re-
[01:13:05.854 --> 01:13:13.019]  Cast and evaluate where we are from just hours ago, where you said, yeah, they're saying it's a Trump failure.
[01:13:13.399 --> 01:13:14.400]  Media's preparing to steal it.
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:18.122]  All the poll shows he's going to win, but they keep saying he's going to lose.
[01:13:19.043 --> 01:13:20.744]  But I said, is this their propaganda?
[01:13:20.764 --> 01:13:23.066]  And you said, probably he should be winning.
[01:13:23.546 --> 01:13:24.306]  It's now happened.
[01:13:24.326 --> 01:13:28.549]  Let's put up the electoral map for TV viewers, Infowars.com viewers as well.
[01:13:29.090 --> 01:13:30.871]  Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign.
[01:13:31.911 --> 01:13:32.532]  Here we are.
[01:13:32.552 --> 01:13:33.613]  This is magic moment.
[01:13:33.633 --> 01:13:35.074]  We've got New Mexico, Colorado.
[01:13:35.754 --> 01:13:38.836]  Nevada, Oregon, and Washington going to Hillary.
[01:13:39.257 --> 01:13:43.900]  We've got Virginia, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and a few others.
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:48.384]  But my God, I've never seen the map so red.
[01:13:49.985 --> 01:13:56.150]  Does this landslide, 244 Trump right now, Hillary 215, he's got 270 something.
[01:13:56.670 --> 01:13:59.092]  Is this one of the biggest landslides in modern history?
[01:14:01.202 --> 01:14:02.463]  This is really extraordinary.
[01:14:02.603 --> 01:14:13.206]  Obviously you take Michigan, I believe Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, where it's very close, but I believe Trump will pull through, and there you have it.
[01:14:13.286 --> 01:14:14.546]  Let's put you on split screen.
[01:14:14.847 --> 01:14:17.868]  We'll put Roger Stone on split screen, and we'll go through all this right now.
[01:14:17.988 --> 01:14:20.208]  The great crew has been up for 40-something hours.
[01:14:20.508 --> 01:14:21.969]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:14:21.989 --> 01:14:22.669]  Spread that link.
[01:14:23.009 --> 01:14:24.830]  It's not just to get Donald Trump elected, it's about
[01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:33.476]  You're pissing, and I use that term, on mainstream media, and just saying, oh, we've had 25 million views, 27 million views in the last 24 hours, oh, how about 100 million?
[01:14:33.536 --> 01:14:34.276]  Oh, you're so pathetic.
[01:14:34.336 --> 01:14:34.857]  Please continue.
[01:14:35.057 --> 01:14:39.920]  Yeah, look, a friend of mine just called from Fox and he says, you can see, you can tell that Trump won.
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:41.041]  I said, how?
[01:14:41.081 --> 01:14:44.043]  He says, all of a sudden, Brit Yoom sounds like Alex Jones.
[01:14:44.763 --> 01:14:45.864]  It's a great compliment to me.
[01:14:45.884 --> 01:14:46.505]  Is that what he said?
[01:14:46.525 --> 01:14:46.685]  Yeah.
[01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:50.406]  So, these numbers are extraordinary.
[01:14:50.926 --> 01:15:07.290]  If you take Pennsylvania, a state that has eluded the Republicans in the last three presidential elections, where Trump had an appeal in western Pennsylvania that no country club Republican in recent times has been able to match.
[01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:12.831]  He ran almost 15% higher in Allegheny County, which is Pittsburgh.
[01:15:13.831 --> 01:15:19.196]  Then the Republican nominee four years ago, Mitt Romney, there's your difference right there.
[01:15:19.276 --> 01:15:20.517]  Now it's still tight.
[01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:30.044]  When you consider that Hillary Clinton came out of Philadelphia with a 467,000 vote margin, this should be impossible.
[01:15:30.885 --> 01:15:33.247]  And I still believe Trump will pull through here.
[01:15:33.507 --> 01:15:37.849]  It's surreal to have a guy that was in four administrations internally, nine administrations overall.
[01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:40.291]  I mean, the guy they call the master of dark arts.
[01:15:40.351 --> 01:15:42.151]  All I found is your dark art is the truth.
[01:15:42.672 --> 01:15:43.572]  They call me that too.
[01:15:43.712 --> 01:15:44.393]  I just tell the truth.
[01:15:44.673 --> 01:15:48.655]  They're so scared of that they invert reality with all the illegals voting.
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:55.802]  And all the dead people voting, which they've arrested people doing, all of it, all the record fraud, he still has a landslide.
[01:15:56.242 --> 01:15:57.882]  How big was his real victory, Roger?
[01:15:57.902 --> 01:15:59.683]  I mean, I know we can't quantify it.
[01:15:59.703 --> 01:16:01.723]  Probably 10, 15 points higher than this.
[01:16:01.763 --> 01:16:15.947]  The point here is, of course, that the people are so fed up, they are so sour, they are so angry, they are so disillusioned by the globalist cabal that's run the country into the ditch.
[01:16:16.784 --> 01:16:17.946]  This is an uprising.
[01:16:18.586 --> 01:16:19.968]  This is an insurrection.
[01:16:20.048 --> 01:16:20.469]  I've said it.
[01:16:20.549 --> 01:16:21.209]  I've scanned it.
[01:16:21.250 --> 01:16:23.352]  I've looked at it intellectually, but also at a gut level.
[01:16:24.053 --> 01:16:26.135]  He's just not out to get us.
[01:16:27.257 --> 01:16:28.518]  That would be my campaign slogan.
[01:16:28.558 --> 01:16:29.620]  He's not out to get you.
[01:16:30.407 --> 01:16:31.367]  He's got his own interests.
[01:16:31.387 --> 01:16:32.128]  He's not perfect.
[01:16:32.968 --> 01:16:33.588]  He likes women.
[01:16:33.608 --> 01:16:34.069]  Who doesn't?
[01:16:34.289 --> 01:16:35.149]  Unless there's something wrong with you.
[01:16:35.649 --> 01:16:37.270]  He never lied and said, I'm goody two-shoes.
[01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:41.432]  He loves hiring people, giving women and minority promotions if they're hardworking.
[01:16:41.492 --> 01:16:42.452]  I don't care what color you are.
[01:16:43.093 --> 01:16:43.953]  Frickin', I don't care.
[01:16:44.053 --> 01:16:45.013]  Just get the job done.
[01:16:45.714 --> 01:16:47.294]  He is a godsend.
[01:16:47.715 --> 01:16:50.596]  And thank God for this pig-headed, mule-headed man.
[01:16:51.926 --> 01:16:53.608]  He is stubborn.
[01:16:53.668 --> 01:16:55.810]  And he insisted from the beginning.
[01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:57.252]  He's the only guy I think... No, no, no.
[01:16:57.272 --> 01:16:57.752]  Let's say it.
[01:16:57.812 --> 01:16:59.754]  Let's say why you were the campaign head and you got kicked off.
[01:16:59.774 --> 01:17:00.555]  The campaign's over.
[01:17:00.815 --> 01:17:02.417]  Looks like he's won 99% chance.
[01:17:03.418 --> 01:17:07.582]  The fact is you're the only guy that will actually challenge him and say what you really think.
[01:17:07.642 --> 01:17:08.704]  Everybody else is a yes man.
[01:17:09.424 --> 01:17:14.490]  My conversation is actually amazing how smart he is and he's already on the same page, but I guess I wasn't arguing with him.
[01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:21.919]  He's like, I agree, that's totally... It's like, okay, well, okay, God, the next day he says exactly what I told him.
[01:17:22.159 --> 01:17:23.420]  But he was already saying it to me, it's like...
[01:17:24.161 --> 01:17:25.281]  They figured it out in the media.
[01:17:25.301 --> 01:17:33.364]  It's like a Vulcan mind meld because they've heard me on air when he's giving a speech and I'm like saying something and he says it and they go, did Jones write the speech?
[01:17:33.744 --> 01:17:36.025]  No, it's like some weird mind meld.
[01:17:36.065 --> 01:17:36.645]  What's happening?
[01:17:36.705 --> 01:17:38.806]  No, I think what it is is we're of like minds.
[01:17:38.826 --> 01:17:39.706]  We're in the same spirit.
[01:17:39.946 --> 01:17:40.466]  Exactly.
[01:17:40.606 --> 01:17:42.187]  So it's not like you're feeding him lines.
[01:17:42.247 --> 01:17:43.727]  Nobody feeds Donald Trump lines.
[01:17:43.807 --> 01:17:45.088]  I worked for him for 30 years.
[01:17:45.128 --> 01:17:46.668]  I'm not bragging for myself, but let's just be honest.
[01:17:47.168 --> 01:17:48.849]  They admit he doesn't listen to many people.
[01:17:49.369 --> 01:17:51.011]  He listens to you, he's talked to me a few times.
[01:17:51.031 --> 01:17:54.295]  The point is, is that why is he listening to us and other people?
[01:17:54.355 --> 01:17:55.256]  Why does that scare them?
[01:17:56.226 --> 01:17:57.947]  Look, he is unscripted.
[01:17:58.187 --> 01:17:59.448]  He's unprogrammed.
[01:17:59.748 --> 01:18:00.789]  He's uncoached.
[01:18:00.869 --> 01:18:01.730]  He's genuine.
[01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:04.492]  He's real, and that's why he's done so well here.
[01:18:04.912 --> 01:18:07.914]  This is why voters like him, because he's not phony.
[01:18:08.234 --> 01:18:10.796]  Hillary Clinton exudes phoniness.
[01:18:11.176 --> 01:18:11.857]  She's flat.
[01:18:12.157 --> 01:18:13.378]  And I'll tell you a story.
[01:18:13.838 --> 01:18:20.763]  Again, they came to me when Bush was about to run for president, like 1999, they said, the governor really likes you as the state police.
[01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:22.584]  He's going to be president soon.
[01:18:23.264 --> 01:18:24.926]  We want you to say nice stuff about him tonight.
[01:18:25.731 --> 01:18:26.191]  And I didn't.
[01:18:27.552 --> 01:18:32.053]  And then I was at a Mexican food restaurant, and Bush and Rick Perry were there, when he was governor.
[01:18:32.073 --> 01:18:33.354]  This just happened in front of my crew.
[01:18:33.554 --> 01:18:34.274]  Mike Hansen saw it.
[01:18:34.874 --> 01:18:37.575]  They came over, he's like, Alex, I... I hit him with his fake voice.
[01:18:37.695 --> 01:18:38.856]  I'd appreciate it if you'd be nicer.
[01:18:39.156 --> 01:18:41.337]  That shows how they try to, like, collect talk show hosts.
[01:18:41.357 --> 01:18:42.197]  Not that I was that important.
[01:18:43.155 --> 01:18:43.756]  I don't care.
[01:18:43.776 --> 01:18:44.436]  I want to make this clear.
[01:18:44.737 --> 01:18:47.679]  I don't care about sniffing the jock of some politician or some president.
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:49.981]  With Trump, he's the outsider.
[01:18:50.042 --> 01:18:50.922]  He's the unicorn.
[01:18:51.163 --> 01:18:51.723]  He did it.
[01:18:51.943 --> 01:18:52.584]  He won.
[01:18:52.884 --> 01:18:56.287]  He fought them when they tried to steal the nomination.
[01:18:56.588 --> 01:18:57.649]  He did everything right.
[01:18:57.989 --> 01:18:58.710]  He scared them.
[01:18:59.110 --> 01:19:01.032]  And then for me, though, I'll be honest with you.
[01:19:02.133 --> 01:19:05.956]  It's better ecstasy than bagging the prom queen.
[01:19:06.116 --> 01:19:06.777]  And I'm not bragging.
[01:19:06.817 --> 01:19:08.098]  I'm just saying that
[01:19:10.171 --> 01:19:12.192]  From the time I was a sophomore, I got the prom queen every year.
[01:19:13.093 --> 01:19:14.193]  It's ten times better.
[01:19:14.674 --> 01:19:16.014]  It's like so ethereal.
[01:19:16.174 --> 01:19:20.037]  I cannot believe that Trump's tuned into reality.
[01:19:20.077 --> 01:19:21.177]  He loves America.
[01:19:21.437 --> 01:19:22.718]  His sons love America.
[01:19:22.918 --> 01:19:24.439]  They're retweeting our stuff every day.
[01:19:24.759 --> 01:19:25.520]  We're in sync.
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:26.300]  It's fun.
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:27.261]  We're doing it.
[01:19:27.481 --> 01:19:29.122]  And I feel the spirit rising.
[01:19:29.422 --> 01:19:30.462]  This is so cool.
[01:19:30.783 --> 01:19:31.583]  Cut taxes.
[01:19:31.883 --> 01:19:32.744]  Make us wealthy.
[01:19:33.624 --> 01:19:35.046]  You know, bring people together.
[01:19:35.126 --> 01:19:37.729]  This is like the rediscovery of America.
[01:19:38.089 --> 01:19:38.830]  I know I'm ranting.
[01:19:39.090 --> 01:19:41.913]  It's just, it's so satisfying.
[01:19:42.294 --> 01:19:43.916]  I don't want to be recognized by Hollywood.
[01:19:43.936 --> 01:19:45.998]  I don't want to be recognized by a bunch of scum.
[01:19:46.518 --> 01:19:49.982]  But when it comes to Trump or somebody like Matt Drudge, who I know are real,
[01:19:50.823 --> 01:19:53.744]  Then it's real satisfaction.
[01:19:53.844 --> 01:19:55.225]  It's like a kinship.
[01:19:55.565 --> 01:19:57.246]  It's a spiritual electricity.
[01:19:57.546 --> 01:19:58.026]  I'm ranting.
[01:19:58.046 --> 01:19:58.466]  Takeover!
[01:19:58.566 --> 01:19:59.667]  You're so polite!
[01:19:59.807 --> 01:20:04.629]  I really think that the guy who deserves the credit here is Trump.
[01:20:05.049 --> 01:20:13.332]  Trump was so much better than his campaign, with the exception of Steve Bannon, who I frankly think came in with key strategic advice at the end.
[01:20:13.372 --> 01:20:14.593]  Go for Michigan!
[01:20:14.613 --> 01:20:15.673]  Go for Wisconsin!
[01:20:16.033 --> 01:20:19.015]  Even though you were business partners with Manafort who did some good work,
[01:20:19.995 --> 01:20:25.502]  You, early on, on the phone, said to me, I love Manafort, he's doing good, but I can tell you, this Bannon, this guy's awesome.
[01:20:25.522 --> 01:20:27.244]  Well, because he thinks outside the box.
[01:20:27.284 --> 01:20:31.650]  Look, Manafort deserves credit for crushing the... The Mexico bill.
[01:20:31.690 --> 01:20:34.433]  Well, first of all, winning the late primaries, including Indiana.
[01:20:35.401 --> 01:20:38.123]  Because he took over the delegate selection process.
[01:20:38.143 --> 01:20:40.125]  So Trump was a genius of who he needed to win?
[01:20:40.645 --> 01:20:42.386]  He pulled in the right guy at the right time.
[01:20:42.767 --> 01:20:47.390]  I think he gave Donald solid advice in terms of Mike Pence, who's turned out to be a 10 strike.
[01:20:47.570 --> 01:20:48.531]  The perfect guy.
[01:20:49.392 --> 01:20:52.334]  Hardworking, loyal, good looking guy too.
[01:20:52.414 --> 01:20:54.936]  I could do his stunt double work if you don't mind.
[01:20:55.436 --> 01:20:58.640]  No, Pence, Pence is, he's so real.
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:00.282]  And let's look at our alternatives.
[01:21:00.442 --> 01:21:03.645]  Newt Gingrich, who spends every other word stabbing Donald Trump in the back.
[01:21:03.926 --> 01:21:07.970]  Or Chris Christie, who lied about the George Washington Bridge Corps.
[01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:10.733]  Or, nothing against Italians, Mr. Godfather Giuliani.
[01:21:10.954 --> 01:21:13.276]  No, I don't think that was ever in the cards.
[01:21:13.436 --> 01:21:14.898]  We were down to the big three.
[01:21:16.733 --> 01:21:24.856]  Uh, Gingrich, uh, who Donald's brother, uh, son-in-law favored, uh, and of course, uh, Christie, who Corey Lewandowski was for.
[01:21:24.936 --> 01:21:32.119]  And of course, it was a great senator from Alabama, but... Sessions, who was my first choice, but who I think took himself out of it.
[01:21:32.819 --> 01:21:35.440]  And will be, and will be a great Secretary of Defense.
[01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:36.300]  How classy is Sessions?
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:42.402]  He is, I've known the guy since Young Republicans, there's your next Secretary of Defense, and he'd be terrific.
[01:21:42.863 --> 01:21:46.384]  And the class level, he's like a god compared to Hillary.
[01:21:46.864 --> 01:21:51.426]  It's not that he's even perfect, but he's just real, and he cares, and he's smart.
[01:21:52.006 --> 01:21:55.528]  So, but Trump is the one who said, look, I'm going to do this my way.
[01:21:55.648 --> 01:21:58.389]  It's kind of like the Frank Sinatra song, I want to do it my way.
[01:21:58.409 --> 01:21:58.529]  My way.
[01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:59.689]  And he did do it his way.
[01:21:59.709 --> 01:22:00.790]  I do it my way.
[01:22:00.810 --> 01:22:02.170]  Can we cue that up folks on YouTube?
[01:22:02.190 --> 01:22:02.410]  Go ahead.
[01:22:02.451 --> 01:22:05.612]  I think he's the only guy who's probably not surprised tonight.
[01:22:06.332 --> 01:22:08.053]  I was told he was serene all day.
[01:22:08.113 --> 01:22:09.074]  He was in a great mood.
[01:22:09.094 --> 01:22:10.295]  You told me three days ago.
[01:22:10.595 --> 01:22:11.516]  He thinks he's going to win.
[01:22:11.796 --> 01:22:12.616]  He's in great spirits.
[01:22:12.656 --> 01:22:13.497]  He does have momentum.
[01:22:13.997 --> 01:22:14.518]  He's in heaven.
[01:22:14.798 --> 01:22:15.318]  Yeah.
[01:22:15.378 --> 01:22:19.321]  So, I mean, look, there are a dozen things his campaign could have done differently.
[01:22:20.002 --> 01:22:20.662]  It's moot now.
[01:22:20.782 --> 01:22:21.863]  It's immaterial.
[01:22:22.984 --> 01:22:24.024]  Let's put the board up.
[01:22:24.445 --> 01:22:26.146]  Is there any way he could lose now?
[01:22:26.306 --> 01:22:27.407]  They're going to try to recount.
[01:22:27.687 --> 01:22:28.748]  Hillary's going to challenge it.
[01:22:28.768 --> 01:22:33.050]  They're going to say the Russians did it, which is the biggest load of crap the world ever saw.
[01:22:33.911 --> 01:22:35.352]  I mean, they came out with Russian agent folks.
[01:22:35.372 --> 01:22:39.693]  This is like... I don't want to get into stuff, but my family's fought the communists like nobody.
[01:22:39.713 --> 01:22:47.516]  I mean, Buckley was in Guatemala under rocket attack at the command base with his dad running the teletypes back to the White House with Morse code.
[01:22:47.956 --> 01:22:52.037]  You know, I mean, the claims that we're communists is the biggest load of horse crap you ever heard.
[01:22:52.338 --> 01:22:53.258]  This is not working.
[01:22:54.079 --> 01:22:57.240]  No, it has failed as a political message.
[01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:58.240]  It was a nice try.
[01:22:58.861 --> 01:23:02.402]  But they have to be in shock at Clinton world right now.
[01:23:02.462 --> 01:23:04.482]  They have to be in absolute shock.
[01:23:06.143 --> 01:23:10.184]  And David Brock, wherever you are, I hope you're having a wonderful evening.
[01:23:10.304 --> 01:23:11.004]  And it came out.
[01:23:11.104 --> 01:23:12.485]  He said, I'm going to infiltrate media.
[01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:13.665]  I'm going to shut them down.
[01:23:13.725 --> 01:23:14.605]  And they did, Fox.
[01:23:15.266 --> 01:23:16.046]  They tried us.
[01:23:16.146 --> 01:23:16.886]  We discovered it.
[01:23:17.526 --> 01:23:19.467]  And I don't talk about this on air because it's so James Bond-y.
[01:23:19.507 --> 01:23:22.248]  But when you are like, have full bore
[01:23:22.968 --> 01:23:24.851]  Operatives pop up in your organization.
[01:23:24.891 --> 01:23:26.693]  It's like, whoa, this is so real.
[01:23:26.953 --> 01:23:28.415]  It doesn't make you crap your pants.
[01:23:28.775 --> 01:23:29.616]  It makes you double down.
[01:23:30.037 --> 01:23:34.442]  Well, look, they Mao Mao'd CNN, they Mao Mao'd Fox, they Mao Mao'd MSNBC.
[01:23:35.323 --> 01:23:39.488]  I'm suddenly banned, although they didn't even give you the courtesy of a letter telling you you're banned.
[01:23:39.528 --> 01:23:41.109]  They let you read it in the newspaper.
[01:23:42.290 --> 01:23:43.351]  Like that's some power.
[01:23:43.591 --> 01:23:45.252]  You're banned from a mausoleum.
[01:23:45.412 --> 01:23:47.834]  Well, you're banned from a network that no one's watching.
[01:23:48.434 --> 01:23:52.496]  So, look, it is... So what is the postmortem on this?
[01:23:53.537 --> 01:23:55.478]  That they had all the advantages.
[01:23:55.538 --> 01:23:57.499]  They had all the establishment advantages.
[01:23:57.559 --> 01:24:00.441]  They spent a billion plus dollars.
[01:24:00.501 --> 01:24:02.022]  I think Trump spent $230 million.
[01:24:04.546 --> 01:24:06.948]  They had the mainstream media.
[01:24:06.988 --> 01:24:08.909]  What's that worth in terms of advertising?
[01:24:08.949 --> 01:24:09.930]  Just millions, right?
[01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:11.811]  They had all these advantages.
[01:24:12.232 --> 01:24:14.193]  Trump had never run a campaign before.
[01:24:14.213 --> 01:24:14.874]  It'd be technical.
[01:24:14.894 --> 01:24:15.574]  She spent a billion.
[01:24:15.954 --> 01:24:16.735]  It's billions.
[01:24:17.235 --> 01:24:22.759]  But it shows how it's these big corporations that get tax money and defense deals and bailouts.
[01:24:22.899 --> 01:24:24.540]  They lose money.
[01:24:24.961 --> 01:24:26.762]  Hundreds of millions at New York Times, they're losing.
[01:24:27.062 --> 01:24:28.003]  Fifty million a year or more.
[01:24:28.463 --> 01:24:30.565]  All this money, they just lose, lose, lose.
[01:24:30.605 --> 01:24:31.245]  They're a joke.
[01:24:31.265 --> 01:24:32.046]  They're already dead.
[01:24:33.441 --> 01:24:33.882]  It's true.
[01:24:34.142 --> 01:24:35.203]  It's absolutely true.
[01:24:35.283 --> 01:24:39.266]  Yet, they had no trouble filling their coffers.
[01:24:40.067 --> 01:24:49.014]  And if you put the Super PAC money next to the party money and the nominee money, this was a multi-billion dollar undertaking.
[01:24:49.514 --> 01:24:52.537]  The very best analytic analysis.
[01:24:52.617 --> 01:24:55.579]  The very mountains, hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:24:56.559 --> 01:25:00.828]  In Nevada, they spent a hundred million dollars on television.
[01:25:00.868 --> 01:25:02.010]  Trump spent nothing.
[01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:05.878]  But, God loves drunk children in the United States of America, to quote Von Bismarck.
[01:25:06.837 --> 01:25:10.299]  I want you to take, let's put up the Fox News projections.
[01:25:10.339 --> 01:25:15.661]  New York Times is a little bit lower, but it is Trump is the next United States President.
[01:25:15.761 --> 01:25:18.483]  254 beautiful points to 215.
[01:25:18.683 --> 01:25:24.486]  I had Dr. Ron Paul on today, who I respect so much, and I said, the whole power structure is against him.
[01:25:24.986 --> 01:25:27.847]  The people that want to destroy you, can you not endorse him?
[01:25:27.887 --> 01:25:33.910]  And he said, well, I can kind of endorse Trump because I hate seeing what's happening, but I want to be a purist on ideology of liberty.
[01:25:33.930 --> 01:25:34.731]  And I said, I get that.
[01:25:37.401 --> 01:25:39.621]  The elite that's out to get us is against Trump.
[01:25:39.941 --> 01:25:41.242]  They've never been more freaked out.
[01:25:41.262 --> 01:25:42.322]  It wasn't some feign.
[01:25:43.162 --> 01:25:44.122]  It wasn't some scam.
[01:25:44.142 --> 01:25:49.583]  Man, we got... I didn't bitch about this on air, but we never get above 180 affiliates.
[01:25:51.123 --> 01:25:57.064]  But we had stations that we've been on a decade take us off and say, it's because you support Trump.
[01:25:57.504 --> 01:26:00.345]  We were just given a million, two million dollar deal for this paid show.
[01:26:00.365 --> 01:26:01.925]  And it was specifically to get you off.
[01:26:01.965 --> 01:26:03.885]  Big insurance companies, medical shows, you name it.
[01:26:04.606 --> 01:26:06.426]  Come on in if you got something to add.
[01:26:07.588 --> 01:26:12.791]  It didn't matter because we ended up now over 240 affiliates as of last week.
[01:26:13.352 --> 01:26:15.533]  And they're not, and I love the mom and pops, they're great.
[01:26:15.553 --> 01:26:19.195]  We've been on some stations like WBCR 20 years in Tennessee.
[01:26:19.996 --> 01:26:24.719]  But we're not talking 1,000 watt AMs anymore, 50,000 watts, the biggest there are, 100,000 watt FMs.
[01:26:25.339 --> 01:26:28.461]  And we're on the biggest stations in New York and Los Angeles now.
[01:26:29.061 --> 01:26:33.144]  And the thing is Liberty One, it's like, it's on, it's successful.
[01:26:33.164 --> 01:26:36.426]  Oh, here we go, Frank Sinatra.
[01:26:38.366 --> 01:26:40.487]  So, uh, let's bring your assistant over here.
[01:26:40.527 --> 01:26:44.310]  He's got something to add to you about some big breaking news, but you've got your Netflix crew here.
[01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:44.750]  Just bring them in.
[01:26:45.651 --> 01:26:46.071]  It's fine.
[01:26:47.092 --> 01:26:47.552]  Bring the crew in.
[01:26:47.572 --> 01:26:49.073]  Yeah?
[01:26:49.093 --> 01:26:50.014]  Yeah, yeah, that's what we're saying.
[01:26:50.054 --> 01:26:51.175]  I forgot what you're with.
[01:26:51.215 --> 01:26:52.776]  It's just, this is not about us, man.
[01:26:52.856 --> 01:27:02.723]  It's about my ancestors that died at the Alamo, and that died at Sedona, the people that died at Concord, and everything.
[01:27:02.803 --> 01:27:04.444]  It's like we now get to join them.
[01:27:05.629 --> 01:27:07.110]  We get to at least be near them.
[01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:08.771]  We're not as badass as they are.
[01:27:09.051 --> 01:27:11.533]  We didn't kill people, but we were with them.
[01:27:11.733 --> 01:27:12.834]  We did it our way.
[01:27:15.116 --> 01:27:22.040]  And now we have to make sure Trump delivers, and we have to be good Americans, and hire poor people, and hire folks, and build an economy.
[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:25.383]  Because that's what it's all about, to have wealth.
[01:27:25.403 --> 01:27:28.305]  You build a better world, you care about people.
[01:27:28.325 --> 01:27:30.306]  See, I have no concern about that.
[01:27:30.386 --> 01:27:31.947]  Trump is a doer.
[01:27:32.127 --> 01:27:34.389]  Trump doesn't believe there's anything that can't be done.
[01:27:35.249 --> 01:27:36.250]  That's the spirit of America.
[01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:39.371]  That serene confidence is what's gotten through this.
[01:27:39.511 --> 01:27:42.012]  He's thought from the beginning, if I run, I'm gonna win.
[01:27:42.452 --> 01:27:44.573]  He's just, he's not a, he's not a good people.
[01:27:45.033 --> 01:27:47.014]  And you can't buy him, and you can't bully him.
[01:27:47.094 --> 01:27:48.654]  That's what really drives them crazy.
[01:27:48.954 --> 01:27:52.476]  You can't offer him ten million dollars because he doesn't need it and he doesn't want it.
[01:27:52.856 --> 01:27:55.577]  This guy's owned by no one but the American people.
[01:27:56.237 --> 01:28:00.319]  You're gonna have the first president in my lifetime, and I'm talking about some guys that I love.
[01:28:00.939 --> 01:28:05.541]  But there is no special interest that can influence Donald Trump.
[01:28:05.861 --> 01:28:06.642]  He's his own man.
[01:28:06.982 --> 01:28:09.383]  They fixed the polls.
[01:28:10.183 --> 01:28:11.804]  The WikiLeaks proved it.
[01:28:11.864 --> 01:28:12.984]  They fixed the questions.
[01:28:13.024 --> 01:28:14.165]  They ran the networks.
[01:28:14.665 --> 01:28:15.826]  They've discredited themselves.
[01:28:15.846 --> 01:28:19.207]  They bet everything in their arrogance, like Hitler, and lost.
[01:28:19.928 --> 01:28:21.628]  Just like in Berlin and that bunker.
[01:28:23.289 --> 01:28:26.070]  Now, where do they go from here?
[01:28:26.891 --> 01:28:27.991]  They're not going to give up.
[01:28:28.031 --> 01:28:29.412]  They're going to contest this election.
[01:28:30.424 --> 01:28:36.108]  Well, there are teams headed to Florida now to secure the ballots and make sure everything is nailed down.
[01:28:37.489 --> 01:28:41.171]  What they will do, actually, is what they tried to do with Reagan.
[01:28:41.251 --> 01:28:44.533]  They'll try to infiltrate and neutralize.
[01:28:44.673 --> 01:28:46.695]  They'll try to, they'll try to
[01:28:47.775 --> 01:28:48.536]  This old trick.
[01:28:49.076 --> 01:28:51.217]  You don't know how government works, but we do.
[01:28:51.297 --> 01:28:52.097]  We're here to help you.
[01:28:52.257 --> 01:28:53.178]  Let us help you.
[01:28:53.578 --> 01:28:55.439]  We're really pros at how this all works.
[01:28:55.519 --> 01:28:56.319]  That'll be a brick wall.
[01:28:56.539 --> 01:28:58.760]  And Trump will never go for it.
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.182]  So will they give him a little bullet treatment like Reagan?
[01:29:01.342 --> 01:29:04.203]  Well, that's just why I pray for his personal security.
[01:29:04.703 --> 01:29:05.924]  You know, I think... That's right.
[01:29:06.064 --> 01:29:13.848]  Now, we've had the New York Times, the LA Times, Newsweek, Time Magazine, all say kill Donald Trump.
[01:29:14.735 --> 01:29:15.416]  Because that's liberal.
[01:29:15.476 --> 01:29:18.578]  You know, turn the Islamists loose, kill them by the Middle East, that's liberal.
[01:29:18.838 --> 01:29:21.620]  As long as it's liberal, I came, I saw, he died, it's okay.
[01:29:22.581 --> 01:29:25.984]  Hitler's good if Lady Gaga's wearing a fascist outfit because it's liberal.
[01:29:26.484 --> 01:29:35.511]  So, you're a smart guy, you're a politico, what do they do next now that through Trump there's been this historic revolution not seen since 1776?
[01:29:37.139 --> 01:29:38.580]  I think Providence is with him.
[01:29:39.161 --> 01:29:40.542]  I think he is protected.
[01:29:40.702 --> 01:29:44.785]  I think none of this would have been possible without his deep belief in God.
[01:29:45.185 --> 01:29:46.786]  None of this would have been possible.
[01:29:46.806 --> 01:29:49.929]  And let's talk about that, because I know some inside baseball, but you've known him 40 years.
[01:29:51.147 --> 01:29:55.111]  He's the type of guy, like Christ said, I'm not going to go up there and pray on the mountain with a bunch of Pharisees.
[01:29:55.191 --> 01:29:56.232]  I'm privately with God.
[01:29:56.252 --> 01:30:01.077]  I've told people that actually know Trump, you know him better than I, a lot better, that he actually believes in God.
[01:30:01.657 --> 01:30:03.980]  Talk about that stalwartness, that belief in God.
[01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:10.146]  Look, he doesn't wear it on his sleeve, but whether he's in Florida, whether he's in New York, he's in church on Sunday.
[01:30:10.686 --> 01:30:11.727]  And he goes with his family.
[01:30:12.107 --> 01:30:13.789]  This is a guy who's a deef believer.
[01:30:13.969 --> 01:30:18.453]  And he could never have achieved this without the protection of Providence.
[01:30:18.513 --> 01:30:22.217]  So I am convinced that he is living, call it a charmed life right now.
[01:30:22.917 --> 01:30:23.978]  And he's an instrument.
[01:30:24.118 --> 01:30:25.500]  And he knows he's an instrument.
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:30.604]  And you hear him say in his speeches, it's not about me, it's not about me folks, it's about this movement.
[01:30:30.624 --> 01:30:31.986]  And the news never shows that clip.
[01:30:32.813 --> 01:30:42.021]  What about all the sad souls that serve the system and believe the state is God and they believed that Hillary would deliver them to Valhalla?
[01:30:42.041 --> 01:30:42.721]  What do you say to them?
[01:30:43.922 --> 01:30:44.643]  Disillusioned.
[01:30:46.432 --> 01:30:47.892]  Buying the disinformation.
[01:30:47.992 --> 01:30:52.713]  Look, I can't understand women who lecture me about why they had to vote for her.
[01:30:53.173 --> 01:30:56.454]  She's an epic abuser of women, as I demonstrated in my book.
[01:30:57.094 --> 01:31:10.617]  So, with all the advantages they had, with all the experience they had at running a national election, with all their deep assets in the mainstream media, with the billions of dollars, they still couldn't beat this guy.
[01:31:11.137 --> 01:31:13.958]  Who, let's face it, he ran a grassroots
[01:31:15.258 --> 01:31:20.141]  A guerrilla-style campaign with a fraction of what they had to spend.
[01:31:20.521 --> 01:31:23.263]  He won this on the basis of charisma and message.
[01:31:23.303 --> 01:31:25.004]  He has overturned every metric.
[01:31:25.744 --> 01:31:25.944]  Yes.
[01:31:25.964 --> 01:31:28.325]  The Republicans wouldn't even give him the money he raised.
[01:31:29.086 --> 01:31:29.846]  Hundreds of millions.
[01:31:29.906 --> 01:31:31.487]  So, we've got a Netflix crew here.
[01:31:31.527 --> 01:31:34.729]  We've got more than 3 million people just watching our live streams.
[01:31:35.229 --> 01:31:37.290]  Uncounted AM and FM stations picking us up.
[01:31:37.890 --> 01:31:39.091]  Again, not bragging.
[01:31:39.171 --> 01:31:40.872]  It's a victory against mainstream media.
[01:31:41.873 --> 01:31:42.993]  But people don't trust them.
[01:31:43.013 --> 01:31:43.714]  They're tuned in here.
[01:31:44.682 --> 01:31:59.495]  Roger Stone, they haven't announced it yet, but Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, we can put the feeds on air, New York Times, oh my God, the New York Times, owned by the Mexican Kingpin, Carlos Slim, he's so credible, they admit total victory
[01:32:01.027 --> 01:32:03.708]  For Trump, when do we get the announcement?
[01:32:03.748 --> 01:32:06.170]  I know he's going over to make the announcement.
[01:32:06.190 --> 01:32:07.050]  We talked to him an hour ago.
[01:32:07.090 --> 01:32:10.271]  I was in there when you were on the phone with his crew.
[01:32:10.291 --> 01:32:12.372]  254 electoral, 215 for Hillary.
[01:32:13.153 --> 01:32:15.934]  Is there any way with that map, even if they just hand him everything.
[01:32:15.974 --> 01:32:18.976]  Here we are with Right Side Broadcasting sending us a feed.
[01:32:18.996 --> 01:32:20.817]  This is epic history.
[01:32:21.237 --> 01:32:25.719]  Is there any way Donald J. Trump is not the next POTUS of the Republic?
[01:32:26.039 --> 01:32:27.101]  I think this is done.
[01:32:27.382 --> 01:32:27.963]  It's baked.
[01:32:28.143 --> 01:32:33.733]  Donald Trump will be the next President of the United States and he will make America great again.
[01:32:35.475 --> 01:32:40.779]  And then we go, oh, he's going to make a path to citizenship easier if you do a background check on a criminal.
[01:32:40.879 --> 01:32:41.519]  Oh my God!
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:46.563]  He's going to not let China have a corporate tax 10% lower than ours and send our jobs there.
[01:32:46.703 --> 01:32:47.384]  Oh, so evil!
[01:32:48.505 --> 01:32:52.768]  He's going to not let them have a currency tariff 35% below us.
[01:32:53.168 --> 01:32:54.089]  How horrible!
[01:32:54.449 --> 01:32:55.590]  He's such a bad man!
[01:32:56.010 --> 01:32:57.211]  He's going to build the wall.
[01:32:57.711 --> 01:33:00.273]  I had an argument with a reporter today about this.
[01:33:00.313 --> 01:33:05.356]  He said, oh, at this point, he clearly understands that's an engineering feat that can't be done.
[01:33:05.376 --> 01:33:06.356]  What are you talking about?
[01:33:06.937 --> 01:33:07.597]  He will build the wall.
[01:33:07.617 --> 01:33:09.018]  The Chinese built one for the Huns.
[01:33:09.218 --> 01:33:12.120]  He understands that it's not an engineering feat.
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:13.581]  Mexico has one in Guatemala.
[01:33:13.641 --> 01:33:14.782]  It's symbolic.
[01:33:15.602 --> 01:33:16.503]  It's the symbolism.
[01:33:16.603 --> 01:33:17.203]  It's delivery.
[01:33:17.784 --> 01:33:21.347]  And he knows that if he does not deliver, he'll be a one-term president.
[01:33:21.767 --> 01:33:24.929]  And he will have reputed everything else that he won on.
[01:33:25.029 --> 01:33:27.911]  So, there is no doubt in my mind, he's stubborn.
[01:33:28.512 --> 01:33:31.914]  He will build the wall, meaning he will seal our borders.
[01:33:32.155 --> 01:33:36.578]  And by the way, I'm not bashing Trump, I love him, but I get the symbology and creativity of a wall.
[01:33:37.118 --> 01:33:38.739]  Obviously, people can tunnel under it, whatever.
[01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:41.622]  The point is, it's the idea of we're allowed to have a country.
[01:33:42.282 --> 01:33:43.383]  Every other country has borders.
[01:33:43.683 --> 01:33:45.965]  You can't go to Mexico and have a kid for free and have it paid for.
[01:33:45.985 --> 01:33:50.268]  Then how the hell am I racist if I don't want to go along with that?
[01:33:50.288 --> 01:33:53.131]  This is pure de-industrialization.
[01:33:53.251 --> 01:33:54.372]  Leanne McEnany, you want to come in here?
[01:33:54.392 --> 01:33:56.193]  We've got Leanne right there at the door.
[01:33:56.233 --> 01:33:56.954]  Come on in, Leanne.
[01:33:57.354 --> 01:33:57.874]  Now get on here.
[01:33:57.894 --> 01:33:59.315]  We're going to set another microphone up for you.
[01:33:59.816 --> 01:34:00.496]  You come on in here.
[01:34:01.677 --> 01:34:02.458]  You're watching in front of me.
[01:34:02.678 --> 01:34:03.619]  What are the latest numbers?
[01:34:03.639 --> 01:34:07.402]  Because we've got, you know, we've got Americanism, non-globalism worldwide happening right now.
[01:34:11.243 --> 01:34:12.183]  We have to come to the microphone.
[01:34:13.784 --> 01:34:15.124]  Give her a handheld microphone.
[01:34:15.144 --> 01:34:18.445]  We're actually, I actually built all this so people be on air.
[01:34:18.845 --> 01:34:20.145]  I don't have a jet or a mansion.
[01:34:20.245 --> 01:34:24.587]  I put a hundred million into this in the last ten years and that's what we do.
[01:34:24.607 --> 01:34:24.587]  13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.
[01:34:26.467 --> 01:34:27.668]  Good, 17, 18.
[01:34:28.388 --> 01:34:29.408]  They're testing the microphone.
[01:34:29.728 --> 01:34:32.529]  But we're actually, there's all these great discussions happening behind the scenes around here.
[01:34:32.809 --> 01:34:33.429]  I want them on air.
[01:34:33.449 --> 01:34:34.850]  Yeah, no, I think it's real.
[01:34:34.890 --> 01:34:35.350]  Go ahead.
[01:34:37.131 --> 01:34:42.878]  It's been at 2.44 to 2.15 for like an hour now and they refuse to update it.
[01:34:43.639 --> 01:34:45.182]  I mean, keeping us all in suspense.
[01:34:45.202 --> 01:34:47.264]  I mean, it's already been... it's for Trump.
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:49.060]  Let us celebrate.
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:50.661]  Let us crack open the champagne.
[01:34:50.681 --> 01:34:52.581]  Owen's sitting there, he wants to smoke a cigar.
[01:34:53.162 --> 01:34:54.302]  But everyone is freaking out.
[01:34:54.322 --> 01:34:55.382]  Look at all these Ford Foundation weirdos.
[01:34:55.402 --> 01:34:56.883]  The Young Turks are freaking out.
[01:34:56.903 --> 01:34:58.143]  CNN is freaking out.
[01:34:58.303 --> 01:35:01.124]  MSNBC, they're all like... Look at this jackass, they're all elegant.
[01:35:01.144 --> 01:35:01.664]  Too close to call.
[01:35:02.264 --> 01:35:04.225]  Nobodies with no viewers, no listeners.
[01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:06.226]  They know it is over for them.
[01:35:06.346 --> 01:35:07.646]  The people do not believe them.
[01:35:08.026 --> 01:35:09.927]  If you look at the New York Times and their... Look at that mummy.
[01:35:10.747 --> 01:35:27.379]  If you look at the New York Times and their projected forecast, and just the ultimate crash and divide that happened with what they had forecasted versus what's actually happening in real time, they worked on such a... No, this is such a repudiation.
[01:35:27.619 --> 01:35:28.940]  What are they going to do, Roger?
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:30.862]  Because, I mean, everything they've done
[01:35:31.582 --> 01:35:33.303]  And they broke up the families.
[01:35:33.323 --> 01:35:36.024]  They've got all these alone trendies that don't have friends.
[01:35:36.064 --> 01:35:37.265]  They think the TV's their friend.
[01:35:37.285 --> 01:35:39.026]  They follow this cosmology.
[01:35:39.086 --> 01:35:40.187]  The TV's their God.
[01:35:40.207 --> 01:35:41.687]  And they have no family.
[01:35:41.727 --> 01:35:42.788]  And now their family lied to them.
[01:35:47.970 --> 01:35:48.570]  There you got it.
[01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:51.671]  Utah just lost their place.
[01:35:51.911 --> 01:36:01.135]  Which the media was telling us only weeks ago the Romneys and McMullen were going to flip to Hillary in a pincer move to suck off votes by a third party candidate.
[01:36:01.155 --> 01:36:02.655]  So the NASCAR will be completed on schedule?
[01:36:03.115 --> 01:36:03.756]  I believe so.
[01:36:03.816 --> 01:36:04.676]  I still think we're there.
[01:36:06.176 --> 01:36:06.717]  Oh my goodness.
[01:36:06.837 --> 01:36:09.057]  And now we can cut taxes on poor people to zero.
[01:36:09.178 --> 01:36:10.318]  Oh my god, it's so horrible.
[01:36:11.648 --> 01:36:14.028]  This is a great time to be alive, isn't it?
[01:36:14.068 --> 01:36:21.070]  JFK wasn't perfect, but didn't he cut taxes 50% for poor people, 30% in other brackets, and tax receipts went up.
[01:36:21.630 --> 01:36:26.551]  It worked for Kennedy, it worked for Reagan, it will work for President Trump.
[01:36:26.811 --> 01:36:28.311]  As long as Trump doesn't increase spending.
[01:36:28.591 --> 01:36:30.671]  That meant Reagan didn't increase spending.
[01:36:30.811 --> 01:36:33.932]  Trump is the greatest tightwad that ever existed.
[01:36:34.112 --> 01:36:38.753]  He will know where every... He's got a 30-year-old airplane he paid off 30 years ago.
[01:36:38.773 --> 01:36:39.933]  What the hell is he doing?
[01:36:40.788 --> 01:36:50.797]  Look, if we could run the federal government the way he runs his company, there will not be a single wasteful or crooked dollar.
[01:36:51.298 --> 01:36:53.520]  He is very frugal, to say the least.
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:37:01.207]  Speaking as someone who's negotiated, I don't know, three or four compensation deals with him over the years, he doesn't leave anything on the table.
[01:37:01.647 --> 01:37:04.310]  He is a shrewd, tough negotiator.
[01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:07.893]  He's the guy you want to send to sit with the Chinese.
[01:37:08.293 --> 01:37:10.776]  He's the guy you want to send to sit with the Mexicans.
[01:37:11.216 --> 01:37:13.798]  He will take their pants, believe me.
[01:37:14.319 --> 01:37:16.981]  But under liberalism, we're not supposed to negotiate.
[01:37:17.001 --> 01:37:20.505]  We're supposed to slit our throats, spray blood directly in our mouth, and roll over.
[01:37:20.745 --> 01:37:21.545]  And roll over again.
[01:37:21.565 --> 01:37:22.987]  Sacrifice ourselves on our country.
[01:37:23.127 --> 01:37:25.769]  Now we've got a Netflix crew here that's covering you and what you're doing.
[01:37:26.290 --> 01:37:30.294]  It is midnight and ten minutes and thirty seconds, central time.
[01:37:31.214 --> 01:37:33.295]  And I know they've got right side broadcasting.
[01:37:33.315 --> 01:37:33.795]  Let's put it up.
[01:37:33.855 --> 01:37:35.616]  Trump is waiting to make his announcement.
[01:37:36.156 --> 01:37:37.637]  You told us this an hour and a half ago it was coming.
[01:37:37.677 --> 01:37:38.618]  You said what hotel it was.
[01:37:38.638 --> 01:37:39.498]  You were on the phone with him.
[01:37:40.018 --> 01:37:40.939]  This is about to come.
[01:37:41.039 --> 01:37:44.220]  When do we... Let's hear some of the audio from this crowd there.
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:45.401]  I think this is imminent.
[01:37:45.441 --> 01:37:45.801]  Let's see.
[01:37:46.545 --> 01:37:50.447]  In Maine's congressional, second congressional district is still out.
[01:37:51.087 --> 01:37:52.768]  Arizona plus New Hampshire.
[01:37:52.788 --> 01:37:54.829]  They did not have the speeches prepared for this.
[01:37:54.869 --> 01:37:59.992]  Newsweek is going to have to take back all those magazines they printed out showing a Clinton win.
[01:38:00.032 --> 01:38:02.913]  God, these, it's a bunch of arrogant mental patients.
[01:38:14.119 --> 01:38:19.625]  They all circle jerk each other, and they're little communist communes just hating our prosperity.
[01:38:20.966 --> 01:38:24.370]  Meanwhile, look at the Clinton campaign headquarters.
[01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:26.732]  Looks like a rather dour place, I'd say.
[01:38:27.613 --> 01:38:33.760]  You know, I thought maybe they shut down the fireworks display, you know, pending the weather, bad weather, but... Is that the funds?
[01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:34.300]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:38:35.902 --> 01:38:36.302]  This is great.
[01:38:36.342 --> 01:38:37.263]  A bunch of bitter women.
[01:38:37.703 --> 01:38:38.983]  I cannot believe.
[01:38:39.283 --> 01:38:40.864]  No, seriously, men and women are together.
[01:38:40.884 --> 01:38:41.524]  We're humanity.
[01:38:41.845 --> 01:38:42.685]  It's all this bitter crap.
[01:38:42.965 --> 01:38:50.208]  They are sitting there literally selling us on a war with Russia, funding radical Islam to take over.
[01:38:50.929 --> 01:38:54.210]  Uma's mother, like, writes books about cutting women's genitals off.
[01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:55.351]  What the hell?
[01:38:55.591 --> 01:38:56.371]  We get their emails.
[01:38:56.451 --> 01:38:58.212]  It's every form of devil worship.
[01:38:59.261 --> 01:39:00.883]  That's pretty uncool, folks, you know?
[01:39:00.903 --> 01:39:02.404]  Devil worshipping?
[01:39:02.444 --> 01:39:03.205]  I mean, what the hell?
[01:39:03.525 --> 01:39:07.289]  Will Obama come out tomorrow, though, and say the election was, in fact, rigged?
[01:39:07.629 --> 01:39:12.134]  No, no, he can't say that because he told us only a week ago it can't be rigged.
[01:39:12.454 --> 01:39:13.355]  It cannot be rigged.
[01:39:13.375 --> 01:39:15.357]  Did you like how early on I put that out?
[01:39:15.537 --> 01:39:16.378]  Yes, yes.
[01:39:16.998 --> 01:39:20.262]  I gotta be honest, he was already gonna do it, but that conversation, he said,
[01:39:21.451 --> 01:39:22.872]  Me, he's always wanting to know, I'll brag now.
[01:39:22.912 --> 01:39:30.138]  He goes, I agree, my advisors have been saying we should have this, but they really tried to steal that from Bernie and me, and I agree, we should make an issue of the barrier.
[01:39:30.178 --> 01:39:31.679]  I was like, yes sir, I think you should.
[01:39:31.699 --> 01:39:32.960]  He goes, well, I'm going to do that tomorrow.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:33.301]  He did it.
[01:39:33.561 --> 01:39:34.942]  They shit their pants.
[01:39:35.042 --> 01:39:41.367]  And they had hit him, they were hitting him today saying, you know, don't you think he's just set this up for an excuse for losing?
[01:39:41.827 --> 01:39:43.629]  I said, no, I think he's raising the question.
[01:39:43.649 --> 01:39:45.430]  No, they stole it from Bernie, he won everywhere.
[01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:48.533]  Right, I think they raised it because it was a real thing.
[01:39:49.313 --> 01:39:58.098]  I just want to see the look on the faces of Jake Tapper, Mike Smirconish, Brit Yume, the whole crowd.
[01:39:58.118 --> 01:40:00.579]  Let me ask you this question, not about us, but Clinton News Network.
[01:40:00.599 --> 01:40:05.862]  You talk about how you have kind of a thorny relationship with him over the 40 years, you know, good buddies, because you disagree with him, other people don't.
[01:40:06.503 --> 01:40:09.564]  When I talk to Trump on air and off air, he seems to like click.
[01:40:10.104 --> 01:40:14.247]  And so with you, I mean, why does he tend to listen to us but other people?
[01:40:14.907 --> 01:40:16.329]  No, look, I don't even want to claim that.
[01:40:16.669 --> 01:40:17.710]  He is his own man.
[01:40:17.730 --> 01:40:20.933]  No, obviously he's not doing what we say, but he gets it.
[01:40:21.013 --> 01:40:26.259]  Because we have the same mentality, because we see the situation the same way.
[01:40:26.319 --> 01:40:29.402]  This guy isn't impressed by Wall Street billionaires.
[01:40:29.762 --> 01:40:34.968]  He'd rather eat with a group of plumbers, or electricians, or cab drivers, or regular people.
[01:40:35.368 --> 01:40:36.529]  So he's a billionaire
[01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:38.271]  Who's not an elitist.
[01:40:38.711 --> 01:40:40.673]  He's a billionaire who's not a snot.
[01:40:40.813 --> 01:40:43.475]  He's a billionaire that doesn't steal the White House china.
[01:40:43.675 --> 01:40:46.137]  He relates to average people.
[01:40:46.597 --> 01:40:51.141]  He speaks, you know, the same colloquial English that real people talk.
[01:40:51.201 --> 01:40:54.764]  There's nothing polished or highfalutin or phony about him.
[01:40:54.844 --> 01:40:56.145]  He's a regular guy.
[01:40:56.165 --> 01:40:57.906]  He's got a great sense of humor.
[01:40:58.247 --> 01:40:59.608]  He's fun to be with.
[01:40:59.968 --> 01:41:04.091]  He likes a good time, but he's never touched a drop of liquor in his life.
[01:41:05.764 --> 01:41:09.309]  You know, he's unique and he's a larger-than-life figure.
[01:41:09.429 --> 01:41:13.975]  None of this would have been possible if he hadn't started this race with the 100% name idea.
[01:41:14.135 --> 01:41:16.237]  The Lord works in mysterious ways.
[01:41:16.258 --> 01:41:17.759]  Let's go back to Right Side Broadcast.
[01:41:17.779 --> 01:41:20.343]  We have an affiliate relationship with showing their feed.
[01:41:20.523 --> 01:41:24.004]  Well, and you can see that the American people, obviously that resonated with them.
[01:41:24.164 --> 01:41:26.265]  They don't resent Trump for his success.
[01:41:26.325 --> 01:41:29.125]  They see that as a virtue of being an American.
[01:41:29.145 --> 01:41:30.566]  Because he wants to cut our taxes.
[01:41:30.866 --> 01:41:35.327]  He's not like Hillary saying, you can't have a car, you can't have air conditioning, but I'm going to build a jumbo jet.
[01:41:35.527 --> 01:41:36.487]  He's not an elitist.
[01:41:38.608 --> 01:41:39.469]  Is that the Clinton?
[01:41:39.969 --> 01:41:41.110]  God, look at the Clinton campaign.
[01:41:41.650 --> 01:41:43.051]  Look at those losers.
[01:41:43.591 --> 01:41:52.576]  They don't see a future as building a car or a computer, but just bitching about how everyone did something to them as they worked for Goldman Sachs and defense contractors.
[01:41:52.596 --> 01:41:54.236]  I thought the world was owed to me!
[01:41:54.497 --> 01:41:58.018]  All the big banks are behind these little snowflakes.
[01:41:58.459 --> 01:41:58.659]  Yeah.
[01:41:59.175 --> 01:42:00.295]  These little snowflakes.
[01:42:00.315 --> 01:42:03.916]  I had an air of expectation.
[01:42:03.936 --> 01:42:07.017]  Can we put the snowflakes on screen?
[01:42:07.297 --> 01:42:08.857]  We have our safe spaces.
[01:42:08.977 --> 01:42:09.877]  No safe spaces here.
[01:42:09.937 --> 01:42:11.797]  God, look at the Clinton campaign HQ.
[01:42:11.857 --> 01:42:14.158]  That looks like a funeral.
[01:42:14.178 --> 01:42:14.538]  A morgue.
[01:42:14.938 --> 01:42:15.618]  Yeah, a funeral.
[01:42:15.638 --> 01:42:18.199]  Oh my gosh.
[01:42:18.479 --> 01:42:19.339]  Can we punch up?
[01:42:19.379 --> 01:42:20.159]  Look at this.
[01:42:20.639 --> 01:42:21.999]  That is the Clinton HQ.
[01:42:22.159 --> 01:42:23.280]  I really can't.
[01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:24.680]  My blood pressure is...
[01:42:25.336 --> 01:42:29.697]  Well, right now you've got to figure Bill is beginning to think about what prison would be like.
[01:42:30.678 --> 01:42:31.198]  And it's about time.
[01:42:31.238 --> 01:42:32.578]  Look at those people.
[01:42:32.678 --> 01:42:35.720]  And the entire House of Cards that tried to prop her up.
[01:42:35.780 --> 01:42:36.420]  And I'm not being mean.
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:37.780]  They're all Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:40.701]  These people, I'll tell you, they had brains one-third the size.
[01:42:40.721 --> 01:42:41.722]  They were not given breast milk.
[01:42:41.842 --> 01:42:43.022]  No, I'm serious.
[01:42:43.322 --> 01:42:44.262]  They didn't have parents.
[01:42:44.623 --> 01:42:46.343]  And they think the state is their mommy.
[01:42:46.763 --> 01:42:51.945]  It's like a dog in a highway following some car that it thinks it's its mommy because it never had one.
[01:42:52.265 --> 01:42:54.306]  And they're just, look at those people.
[01:42:55.066 --> 01:42:56.608]  I mean, I'm sad for them.
[01:42:57.189 --> 01:42:58.710]  They are desperate.
[01:42:58.831 --> 01:43:03.436]  God, I want to give them a job, or build them up, or give them boxing lessons, or something.
[01:43:03.476 --> 01:43:05.438]  I mean, they just have no idea.
[01:43:05.719 --> 01:43:07.000]  Well, I want to say this, though.
[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:09.984]  Despite the outcome tonight, I am... Oh, look, he's crying!
[01:43:10.504 --> 01:43:10.865]  I am not.
[01:43:10.885 --> 01:43:11.706]  His little cigarette.
[01:43:13.737 --> 01:43:19.919]  Despite the outcome tonight, I am not canceling the Hillary for Prison 2017 t-shirts.
[01:43:19.959 --> 01:43:23.700]  We're still going through with those, I guarantee it.
[01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:27.741]  I told anyone who bought that Hillary for Prison t-shirt, it's gonna be a collector's item.
[01:43:27.781 --> 01:43:29.902]  Yeah, we'll have to pay him a royalty, that guy.
[01:43:32.043 --> 01:43:34.526]  Uh, I mean, I'm not being mean to these people.
[01:43:34.646 --> 01:43:35.927]  I want to see them powerful.
[01:43:36.528 --> 01:43:37.309]  Look at them.
[01:43:37.909 --> 01:43:42.434]  It's like when you see some, like, cat that's been electrocuted and is kind of stumbling around.
[01:43:42.614 --> 01:43:45.277]  Is there nobody attractive who was for Hillary Clinton?
[01:43:45.297 --> 01:43:46.638]  No, but I mean, look at these.
[01:43:46.678 --> 01:43:49.081]  These are desperate, soulless people.
[01:43:49.321 --> 01:43:54.866]  Well, they truly think that it's over now, that hope was on the ballot, and dignity, and ethics, and morals.
[01:43:54.906 --> 01:43:57.949]  This is a woman that stole 90% of the Haitian money.
[01:43:58.350 --> 01:43:58.550]  Right.
[01:43:58.650 --> 01:44:03.194]  This is a woman who brags about overthrowing the only country propping up Africa.
[01:44:03.214 --> 01:44:05.476]  Mubarak Gaddafi was a boon to Africa.
[01:44:06.097 --> 01:44:06.698]  They don't care.
[01:44:07.999 --> 01:44:12.923]  No, this is a woman who cast the women of Libya 200 years back into the Stone Ages.
[01:44:14.349 --> 01:44:34.916]  So is she going to come out tomorrow though and when the people have spoken clearly and then call everyone deplorable and say, you know, everyone is, the people have spoken, they want us to go... I don't care if Hillary's shacking up with some chick in her hotel room, but it's then her mother writes books about the virtues as the number one publisher for Islam?
[01:44:36.037 --> 01:44:39.098]  For Saudi Arabia to cut little girls' genitals off?
[01:44:40.018 --> 01:44:40.238]  I mean,
[01:44:42.375 --> 01:44:43.916]  Who are these people?
[01:44:44.336 --> 01:44:47.218]  And how do they always declare the moral high ground?
[01:44:48.498 --> 01:44:53.901]  You do raise an excellent question, which is, what will Hillary say when she makes her speech?
[01:44:54.461 --> 01:45:07.928]  Because this is so beyond the realm of their being able to process the impossibility of this, because the arrogance of their entire campaign has been what's been most off-putting, in my opinion.
[01:45:09.249 --> 01:45:10.410]  I can't even imagine
[01:45:11.532 --> 01:45:12.993]  They must be talking her down.
[01:45:13.153 --> 01:45:15.055]  She's got to be apoplectic.
[01:45:15.175 --> 01:45:16.736]  Alright, I'm gonna go get a drink of water.
[01:45:17.016 --> 01:45:19.417]  I've been up basically since 6 a.m.
[01:45:19.457 --> 01:45:20.158]  My voice is gone.
[01:45:20.198 --> 01:45:20.958]  You guys continue.
[01:45:21.038 --> 01:45:22.039]  Owen Schroeder, pop in.
[01:45:22.659 --> 01:45:23.720]  Got a Netflix crew here.
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:25.421]  But the big announcement's coming.
[01:45:25.461 --> 01:45:26.242]  Donald J. Trump.
[01:45:27.342 --> 01:45:28.323]  Let's put the maps up.
[01:45:28.903 --> 01:45:29.424]  Big victory.
[01:45:30.051 --> 01:45:33.895]  I don't know, whenever I talked to Billy Corgan, like, weeks ago, he told me that he had a vision.
[01:45:33.915 --> 01:45:36.597]  He's like, what happens if Hillary Clinton doesn't win?
[01:45:36.617 --> 01:45:39.980]  And he had this vision of her just, like, crumbling into dust.
[01:45:40.561 --> 01:45:43.844]  I mean, seriously, she has been, this has been her entire...
[01:45:46.073 --> 01:45:49.854]  She's been, for 30 plus years, this has been her one aim, her one goal.
[01:45:49.994 --> 01:45:50.934]  What happens?
[01:45:51.274 --> 01:45:54.455]  Well, because she's Claire Underwood, only worse.
[01:45:55.575 --> 01:45:59.976]  And this has been the plan because she's already been president.
[01:46:00.296 --> 01:46:02.817]  She was co-president of the United States.
[01:46:02.877 --> 01:46:08.538]  In fact, she is the one who ordered the assault on the Waco compound through her
[01:46:09.198 --> 01:46:18.424]  Hand-picked Attorney General Janet Reno, who passed away yesterday, and her former lover Webster Hubble, who is in fact Chelsea Clinton's father.
[01:46:18.784 --> 01:46:20.626]  You can read it in the Clinton's War on Women.
[01:46:22.027 --> 01:46:27.310]  It is beyond her comprehension that she could be beaten by someone like Donald Trump.
[01:46:28.351 --> 01:46:31.173]  They've got to have her close to a straitjacket at this point.
[01:46:31.553 --> 01:46:34.435]  And I don't know how she can be civil
[01:46:35.333 --> 01:46:36.513]  In a concession speech.
[01:46:36.573 --> 01:46:38.314]  This is going to be something else to watch.
[01:46:38.974 --> 01:46:42.355]  This is beyond everyone's comprehension at this point.
[01:46:42.375 --> 01:46:45.376]  I mean, what do you think is happening with the House of Cards right now?
[01:46:45.757 --> 01:46:47.897]  That has put everything, I mean, look at Donna Brazile.
[01:46:48.237 --> 01:46:53.059]  You know, CNN let her go because she's there leaking the debate questions to Hillary Clinton.
[01:46:53.559 --> 01:46:55.420]  And, you know, they're all being exposed.
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:00.261]  And they put everything behind this woman that no one likes.
[01:47:01.042 --> 01:47:01.602]  What do you think
[01:47:02.482 --> 01:47:04.323]  That is happening with the House of Cards right now.
[01:47:04.583 --> 01:47:06.323]  They have to be in full panic mode.
[01:47:07.384 --> 01:47:18.308]  The courtiers around them are getting lashed because, you may remember this, when she was having trouble against Bernie Sanders, there was a great story in which they said it was leaked.
[01:47:19.088 --> 01:47:26.053]  Bill and Hillary were unhappy with her campaign so they were going to be getting rid of some people and hiring new people.
[01:47:26.093 --> 01:47:30.476]  What they didn't understand is the problem with their campaign was her.
[01:47:31.056 --> 01:47:32.237]  She was the problem.
[01:47:32.737 --> 01:47:33.938]  The voters don't like her.
[01:47:34.098 --> 01:47:35.979]  They didn't want to vote for her.
[01:47:36.099 --> 01:47:40.022]  They saw through the fact that she has no record of accomplishment.
[01:47:40.402 --> 01:47:44.505]  In fact, you could say that everything she's ever touched has turned to crap.
[01:47:44.565 --> 01:47:48.788]  Whether it's Benghazi, whether it's the first faint that they took at Hillary Care,
[01:47:50.248 --> 01:47:51.249]  You name it.
[01:47:51.629 --> 01:47:54.630]  Libya, nothing has worked for her.
[01:47:54.870 --> 01:48:01.092]  She's been a disaster in public policy and she keeps talking about her accomplishments for women and children.
[01:48:01.652 --> 01:48:09.474]  She's abused women and 18 children under the age of 8 die in the firefight at Waco when she, she gives the order.
[01:48:09.514 --> 01:48:18.621]  We'll talk about the fact that Trump had zero staff, essentially, and Hillary Clinton had an army behind her for years trying to prop her up and put her in.
[01:48:18.641 --> 01:48:19.561]  But she's liberal.
[01:48:19.582 --> 01:48:21.803]  Hey, what about Senate and House races?
[01:48:21.863 --> 01:48:22.464]  What's happening there?
[01:48:27.597 --> 01:48:28.178]  We're doing good.
[01:48:28.418 --> 01:48:29.820]  Hey, we're not, we're teleprompting for free.
[01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:31.702]  We have so many of them.
[01:48:32.223 --> 01:48:33.985]  Go to the other studio, or hang out with us, Leon.
[01:48:34.025 --> 01:48:34.705]  I'll carry it away.
[01:48:35.406 --> 01:48:36.608]  I'll go back there and get a bottle of water.
[01:48:37.168 --> 01:48:38.670]  Uh, yeah, what about the Senate races?
[01:48:38.730 --> 01:48:39.531]  What about the House races?
[01:48:39.551 --> 01:48:39.972]  Here's the deal.
[01:48:40.793 --> 01:48:41.654]  Trump clearly is the winner.
[01:48:43.390 --> 01:48:46.651]  He's honest, but, you know, he doesn't know about the Internet and things.
[01:48:47.211 --> 01:48:51.432]  How do we make sure he doesn't somehow get manipulated?
[01:48:51.492 --> 01:48:54.153]  I mean, obviously that hasn't happened yet, but where do we go from here?
[01:48:54.313 --> 01:48:59.895]  He's not going to be preempted, because I happen to think stubbornness is one of his greatest
[01:49:00.455 --> 01:49:02.057]  I don't see that happening here.
[01:49:20.538 --> 01:49:30.183]  So, with the Brexit and with Russia pulling out of the globalist operations, they've written in every major establishment publication that a fall of Hillary
[01:49:31.078 --> 01:49:38.904]  Would signify the end of the New World Order, this corporate private world government that they told the trendies didn't exist but they openly set up.
[01:49:39.624 --> 01:49:50.292]  So is that accurate to say that this repudiation of globalism is a major bellwether in the fall of private corporate world government?
[01:49:51.683 --> 01:49:53.624]  I think this is the end for the globalists.
[01:49:53.964 --> 01:50:02.628]  I think it's the end of the two-party elitist duopoly because this election is also a repudiation of the Republican Party leadership.
[01:50:02.749 --> 01:50:13.594]  Not the rank-and-file Republicans who give their money and who, you know, support a conservative agenda only to see their leaders betray it by working with the Democrats.
[01:50:14.014 --> 01:50:15.955]  No, I think the two-party duopoly is over.
[01:50:17.196 --> 01:50:38.940]  No, I just hope that all the people raised by brainwashed parents or single parents or no parents and raised by universities run by big corporations would realize that free market and basic systems of capitalism have built the cities, have built the sports cars, have built the iPods.
[01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:47.146]  They've built all the choices that, albeit made us decadent slobs because they were so great, still it produced it.
[01:50:47.767 --> 01:50:55.333]  And their weird infatuation with North Korea and weird pot-bellied dictators needs to come to an end.
[01:50:55.693 --> 01:51:04.141]  They need to rediscover manhood, feminine power as well, and the human animating contest of destiny.
[01:51:07.694 --> 01:51:09.836]  Who's this gentleman who's unshaven?
[01:51:10.116 --> 01:51:14.200]  So we have some really interesting information that has just come to light.
[01:51:14.861 --> 01:51:20.826]  There's big potential that it looks like the Republicans might actually take back the Senate.
[01:51:22.848 --> 01:51:31.691]  We're assuming this based on the fact that right now Donald Trump has a huge lead in the popular vote.
[01:51:31.711 --> 01:51:32.072]  Thank you.
[01:51:32.672 --> 01:51:39.234]  And there are, right now, the Republicans only need two more seats to take back the Senate.
[01:51:39.515 --> 01:51:46.577]  And there are two senators that are running right now, Roy Blunt in Missouri and Kelly Ayos in New Hampshire.
[01:51:48.638 --> 01:52:00.870]  No, I think this is vitally important, and I think Buckley makes a good point, because the single most important opportunity Trump will have will be to appoint a Supreme Court Justice to fill the vacancy.
[01:52:01.470 --> 01:52:04.153]  Will he deliver on that?
[01:52:04.673 --> 01:52:05.394]  There's no question.
[01:52:05.414 --> 01:52:06.075]  That's a litmus test.
[01:52:06.115 --> 01:52:10.218]  He's already put out a list, and he says whoever he chooses will be on that list.
[01:52:11.352 --> 01:52:16.677]  And we know who his nominees are, and every one of them is a solid, liberty-based conservative.
[01:52:16.797 --> 01:52:20.560]  So, I don't think there'll be any Bush-like surprises.
[01:52:20.580 --> 01:52:28.586]  Remember, Bush gave us David Souter, and then the other Bush gave us John Roberts, who gave us Obamacare.
[01:52:29.207 --> 01:52:31.569]  No, there'll be no surprises.
[01:52:31.649 --> 01:52:34.811]  I think you're going to get a solid, law-and-order conservative.
[01:52:34.851 --> 01:52:36.052]  It's not that Republicans are perfect.
[01:52:36.333 --> 01:52:38.615]  The Democrats are the current metastasization.
[01:52:39.215 --> 01:52:39.815]  They have the cancer.
[01:52:40.175 --> 01:52:41.436]  What are they going to do now?
[01:52:41.516 --> 01:52:53.280]  Because, you know, when they're not at hot dog parties, and kids are supplied with a hot tub, and not doing Aleister Crowley rituals, because they rule us, I mean, why not?
[01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:54.200]  They're so liberal.
[01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:56.341]  When they're not doing that, what are they going to do now?
[01:52:57.978 --> 01:52:58.838]  They're going to lose.
[01:52:59.379 --> 01:53:00.620]  And they're going to keep losing.
[01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:06.223]  Because Trump is going to pursue policies in the country that I think will be popular.
[01:53:06.963 --> 01:53:11.266]  And the key thing for any member of Congress, Republican or Democrat,
[01:53:12.102 --> 01:53:13.083]  is to get re-elected.
[01:53:13.484 --> 01:53:19.692]  And you don't get re-elected when you're standing against the tide of... And I was about to say, they're already blowing us out with debt.
[01:53:20.273 --> 01:53:28.924]  If he just leaves spending the same and cuts taxes, more tax money will come in because of the huge boon it always causes if he just cuts the taxes for poor people.
[01:53:30.045 --> 01:53:31.126]  It's heaven.
[01:53:31.406 --> 01:53:35.149]  Well, it's in his economic plan, but I also think, look, he's a doer.
[01:53:35.289 --> 01:53:42.454]  If he says he is going to cut the corporate tax rate below that of China, below that of Mexico, he'll do it.
[01:53:42.714 --> 01:53:44.855]  And other politicians play ball, they act weak.
[01:53:45.275 --> 01:53:47.937]  With a president with a bully pulpit, he'll get what he wants.
[01:53:48.137 --> 01:53:51.420]  But how many times has he said, here's what's wrong with these politicians.
[01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:53.701]  All talk, no action.
[01:53:53.981 --> 01:53:55.322]  You've heard him say it a hundred times.
[01:53:55.482 --> 01:53:56.883]  All talk, no action.
[01:53:57.243 --> 01:53:59.145]  He's got a very specific agenda.
[01:54:00.105 --> 01:54:01.326]  Is it surreal here though?
[01:54:01.386 --> 01:54:03.828]  Because I saw them all preparing for a Trump defeat.
[01:54:04.188 --> 01:54:05.208]  I knew he was at the polls.
[01:54:05.268 --> 01:54:06.949]  I said, wow, it's horrible what they're doing.
[01:54:07.450 --> 01:54:09.131]  But it seemed over the night he was winning.
[01:54:09.451 --> 01:54:10.732]  Let's go to the Wall Street Journal.
[01:54:10.752 --> 01:54:11.592]  Let's go to the New York Times.
[01:54:11.632 --> 01:54:12.252]  Let's go to Fox.
[01:54:12.272 --> 01:54:13.473]  Let's see what the different versions they have.
[01:54:13.933 --> 01:54:22.258]  They've all got Trump winning 244 to 215 against the daughter of the Chicago mob boss, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[01:54:23.699 --> 01:54:24.340]  They're goddess.
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:24.940]  They're lord.
[01:54:26.126 --> 01:54:31.196]  Uh, so what are they going to do with only Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin?
[01:54:31.697 --> 01:54:34.402]  They claim aren't in Hawaii or North Carolina.
[01:54:34.944 --> 01:54:36.827]  They aren't, is there any way now?
[01:54:38.050 --> 01:54:40.512]  When does Trump make the announcement?
[01:54:40.852 --> 01:54:44.795]  I think, as you said, possession is nine-tenths of the law under common law.
[01:54:45.116 --> 01:54:46.197]  When does he make that announcement?
[01:54:46.337 --> 01:54:49.119]  It appears to me that he's waiting for one of the networks to call it.
[01:54:49.319 --> 01:54:53.642]  That's going to be the only explanation here, and of course he is that close.
[01:54:54.103 --> 01:55:00.408]  You'll notice the headline on CNN that New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Michigan, too close to call.
[01:55:00.508 --> 01:55:03.270]  This is whistling past the graveyard, I think.
[01:55:04.371 --> 01:55:06.793]  No, there aren't many happy faces on CNN tonight.
[01:55:12.478 --> 01:55:16.300]  So, we're sitting here at 12.28 Central Time.
[01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:18.020]  History is happening, Roger.
[01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:22.182]  Not just Donald Trump projected to win, but mainstream media in freefall.
[01:55:22.282 --> 01:55:29.665]  This crew, this little, you know, operation, with more viewers probably right now than CNN has.
[01:55:30.185 --> 01:55:34.887]  I mean, conservatively, on over 200 stations that are picking us up, that's millions.
[01:55:34.907 --> 01:55:39.789]  You add the millions tuned in right now on Facebook and Twitter and Google and our own feeds,
[01:55:40.729 --> 01:55:45.073]  It was 27 million in the last day since I've checked it.
[01:55:45.494 --> 01:55:49.117]  I don't know what it is right now that have tuned in different IP addresses to listen.
[01:55:49.517 --> 01:55:51.339]  What is that message to MSM?
[01:55:51.980 --> 01:56:04.171]  These arrogant chicken-necked weirdos who sit up there with all their little titles and names with like 100,000 viewers on average lecturing us how they're the authority because they have a set bigger than ours.
[01:56:06.836 --> 01:56:08.457]  The answer is yes.
[01:56:09.557 --> 01:56:14.038]  There has to be a great gnashing of teeth at CNN tonight.
[01:56:14.459 --> 01:56:16.779]  They have gone the extra mile.
[01:56:16.839 --> 01:56:18.700]  I mean, look, I've been through a lot of fake polls.
[01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:25.562]  Well, but in the past, the media at least pretended to be objective while they were knifing you.
[01:56:26.062 --> 01:56:28.883]  In this campaign, that pretense has been dropped.
[01:56:30.124 --> 01:56:34.168]  CNN has been a wholly owned subsidiary of the Clinton campaign.
[01:56:34.488 --> 01:56:35.609]  It's been an appendage.
[01:56:36.130 --> 01:56:37.211]  And it's embarrassing.
[01:56:37.491 --> 01:56:39.012]  And it's why no one's watching.
[01:56:39.273 --> 01:56:40.674]  It's why it's not profitable.
[01:56:40.914 --> 01:56:42.716]  It's why their ratings are in the toilet.
[01:56:42.736 --> 01:56:44.217]  Because it's so bad.
[01:56:45.578 --> 01:56:56.523]  And they have to be apoplectic because I'm sure they'd already made their deal to have the president-elect go on CNN so they can pat each other on the back.
[01:56:56.543 --> 01:57:00.405]  This has to be an enormous blow to the folks at CNN.
[01:57:02.546 --> 01:57:06.528]  Look, I don't care about Trump patting me on the head or coming on the show or any of that.
[01:57:06.888 --> 01:57:10.469]  Because quite frankly, he better deliver on everything or he'll seize a liability.
[01:57:11.830 --> 01:57:14.191]  We're outside the whole system trying to change it.
[01:57:15.657 --> 01:57:19.580]  But it's just him having New York Times to write a hit piece for the last week on his plane.
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:23.323]  And I just hope he doesn't go on CNN.
[01:57:24.264 --> 01:57:25.685]  These people are a joke.
[01:57:25.825 --> 01:57:30.309]  I hope when he wins, he just doesn't ever talk to them again.
[01:57:30.629 --> 01:57:31.390]  They are a joke.
[01:57:31.490 --> 01:57:33.311]  He has frozen CNN.
[01:57:33.552 --> 01:57:36.034]  He is very angry at Jeff Zucker.
[01:57:36.234 --> 01:57:39.677]  He has not been on CNN now for quite some time.
[01:57:40.217 --> 01:57:42.838]  The surrogates have been pulled back from CNN.
[01:57:44.018 --> 01:57:46.259]  It's a Hillary Clinton love fest.
[01:57:46.419 --> 01:57:47.780]  This isn't journalism.
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:49.600]  This is propaganda.
[01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:51.581]  This is advertising in essence.
[01:57:51.601 --> 01:57:53.421]  So let's declare them that and admit
[01:57:58.143 --> 01:58:04.929]  That the shareholders of the parent company are paying for it as a violation of Federal Elections Commission for propaganda.
[01:58:05.269 --> 01:58:07.251]  They want to shut us down, claiming we're political.
[01:58:07.512 --> 01:58:08.472]  Yeah, I want freedom.
[01:58:08.532 --> 01:58:09.473]  I want lower taxes.
[01:58:09.493 --> 01:58:10.154]  Yeah, I'm an American.
[01:58:10.174 --> 01:58:10.614]  I have a right.
[01:58:11.095 --> 01:58:14.438]  You people are nakedly political, claiming we're political.
[01:58:15.066 --> 01:58:20.327]  But they never are held responsible for the actions by the regulatory bodies.
[01:58:20.367 --> 01:58:31.811]  Remember Matt Drudge telling me that the FEC was threatening him to try to shut him down, whereas nothing he does is anywhere near as egregious as what's happening at CNN.
[01:58:31.831 --> 01:58:32.251]  That's right.
[01:58:32.291 --> 01:58:34.952]  Let's go back to the right side of broadcasting and live feed InfoWars.com.
[01:58:36.832 --> 01:58:38.413]  We sponsor ourselves.
[01:58:38.853 --> 01:58:40.474]  We have free shipping the next couple days.
[01:58:40.494 --> 01:58:41.574]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:42.395 --> 01:58:45.256]  30 to 40% off all the nutraceuticals, all the products, everything.
[01:58:46.556 --> 01:58:53.019]  It's revolutionary to have media fund itself so that we're not bought and paid for by the establishment.
[01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:57.201]  And so your support of this operation is critical.
[01:58:57.301 --> 01:58:58.442]  I want to thank you for that support.
[01:58:58.482 --> 01:58:59.842]  This is history happening right now.
[01:58:59.862 --> 01:59:01.163]  Take advantage of free shipping.
[01:59:01.503 --> 01:59:03.264]  Take advantage of 34% off across the board.
[01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:06.421]  What are you looking at on your phone there?
[01:59:06.481 --> 01:59:12.907]  I'm trying to determine when our candidate is going to come out and claim the victory that is his.
[01:59:12.987 --> 01:59:14.048]  I'm told that that is imminent.
[01:59:14.068 --> 01:59:17.291]  Let's take a five minute break.
[01:59:17.311 --> 01:59:20.754]  Look at the poor Clinton campaign people.
[01:59:23.656 --> 01:59:25.218]  They aren't doing too well right now.
[01:59:30.219 --> 01:59:31.940]  That is a fine-looking turban.
[01:59:33.942 --> 01:59:41.148]  So we're doing some stupid Bane imitations here right now.
[01:59:42.389 --> 01:59:44.891]  So look at these people.
[01:59:44.911 --> 01:59:45.772]  I mean, these people.
[01:59:46.433 --> 01:59:47.033]  Look at them.
[01:59:47.073 --> 01:59:47.574]  Look at that.
[01:59:48.755 --> 01:59:49.595]  Look at that guy.
[01:59:50.656 --> 01:59:53.539]  Can you imagine if that was your grandfather or grandmother?
[01:59:54.662 --> 01:59:56.508]  I mean the helplessness of these people.
[01:59:57.391 --> 01:59:59.196]  Good God, are those Americans?
[01:59:59.999 --> 02:00:00.821]  Jesus Christ.
[02:00:04.465 --> 02:00:05.585]  They're preying on them.
[02:00:05.705 --> 02:00:06.726]  I look at them as prey.
[02:00:06.746 --> 02:00:08.786]  I just... I want them to become humans.
[02:00:08.906 --> 02:00:11.247]  Look, I feel sorry for these people.
[02:00:11.327 --> 02:00:11.847]  They're dupes.
[02:00:12.287 --> 02:00:13.327]  They don't know any better.
[02:00:13.407 --> 02:00:16.088]  They're buying... We're not too happy right now, though.
[02:00:16.328 --> 02:00:17.349]  No, that's understandable.
[02:00:17.389 --> 02:00:18.229]  It's like King George III.
[02:00:18.249 --> 02:00:19.289]  He was supposed to win, right?
[02:00:19.549 --> 02:00:19.849]  Yes.
[02:00:20.049 --> 02:00:22.510]  He didn't have the providence, though, did he?
[02:00:22.570 --> 02:00:24.711]  He didn't have that special push.
[02:00:25.371 --> 02:00:26.731]  He didn't have that lightning, did he?
[02:00:28.792 --> 02:00:32.953]  As if all these slugs will get in the way of human ascension.
[02:00:33.820 --> 02:00:34.721]  I mean, let's get real.
[02:00:35.663 --> 02:00:41.150]  Trump's got his own problems, but he isn't out to get humanity, and I believe that's the essence of Trump's victory.
[02:00:41.170 --> 02:00:41.570]  What do you say?
[02:00:43.023 --> 02:00:48.546]  This is a classic case of the time and the man meeting each other.
[02:00:48.606 --> 02:00:50.027]  The planets aligning!
[02:00:50.307 --> 02:00:51.007]  It really is.
[02:00:51.027 --> 02:00:53.529]  This could not have happened in my opinion four years ago.
[02:00:53.589 --> 02:00:55.309]  The time was not quite right.
[02:00:55.429 --> 02:00:59.952]  As much as I wanted Donald to run against Romney, I pushed it very hard.
[02:01:00.772 --> 02:01:04.554]  I thought I could convince him, but at the end of the day he didn't want to do it.
[02:01:05.755 --> 02:01:10.257]  But even then, I don't think the voters had yet had their fill
[02:01:12.064 --> 02:01:14.967]  Of the disastrous, elitist leadership of the two parties.
[02:01:15.008 --> 02:01:18.071]  It was Thanksgiving last year and I had family in.
[02:01:18.091 --> 02:01:19.632]  It was like 30 people in my house.
[02:01:20.433 --> 02:01:21.574]  There were a lot of smart folks there.
[02:01:22.455 --> 02:01:26.199]  And they were just like, Alex, Donald Trump's not getting the nomination.
[02:01:27.701 --> 02:01:30.864]  And I looked at them and I said, Donald Trump's going to be the next president of the United States.
[02:01:31.825 --> 02:01:32.566]  And they laughed at me.
[02:01:33.644 --> 02:01:38.505]  Just like they laughed at Nigel Farage saying they'd get out of the EU.
[02:01:39.545 --> 02:01:40.585]  The EU is unelected.
[02:01:40.625 --> 02:01:41.246]  It's dictatorial.
[02:01:41.806 --> 02:01:43.286]  It's not hard to say that would happen.
[02:01:44.086 --> 02:01:46.387]  And so it isn't about a pissing contest with my family.
[02:01:48.247 --> 02:01:49.887]  It's just I wasn't raised by the television.
[02:01:51.368 --> 02:01:53.388]  I didn't go work for a corporation and do it their way.
[02:01:53.788 --> 02:01:54.708]  I built my own thing.
[02:01:55.208 --> 02:01:56.309]  I could see that in Trump.
[02:01:57.129 --> 02:02:00.489]  And it's not that I want to be smarter than people I know.
[02:02:01.170 --> 02:02:03.110]  I want them to shift
[02:02:04.508 --> 02:02:11.593]  And get out of this paradigm where they believe Hollywood's their friend, or the establishment's their friend.
[02:02:13.674 --> 02:02:17.896]  Well, the establishment is the anti-liberal.
[02:02:21.979 --> 02:02:26.822]  A week after Mitt Romney lost, Donald Trump had his attorneys go to the U.S.
[02:02:26.842 --> 02:02:31.265]  Trademark Office and he trademarks the phrase, Make America Great Again.
[02:02:32.509 --> 02:02:35.272]  He didn't even know that it had been Reagan's slogan in 1980.
[02:02:35.332 --> 02:02:36.573]  He didn't remember it.
[02:02:37.874 --> 02:02:40.116]  And then on New Year's Day of 2013, he told me he had done this.
[02:02:42.998 --> 02:02:45.018]  I knew then he was going to run.
[02:02:45.038 --> 02:02:53.560]  I knew that all those who said he's not gonna do it, he's just furnishing his brand, it's all a media hoax, it's just PR.
[02:02:54.140 --> 02:02:55.180]  I knew he was going to run.
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:58.581]  I knew that he regretted not running four years ago.
[02:02:58.781 --> 02:03:01.821]  Although, I still don't think the time was quite right.
[02:03:02.482 --> 02:03:07.062]  So, this dream, which has been a dream of mine since 1988, has been a long time coming.
[02:03:11.109 --> 02:03:15.332]  But it really is a confluence of events that you could not foresee.
[02:03:16.253 --> 02:03:18.895]  He is exactly the right man for the time.
[02:03:18.995 --> 02:03:19.756]  It's providence.
[02:03:20.617 --> 02:03:21.317]  It's an alignment.
[02:03:21.618 --> 02:03:28.443]  He's not a globalist at a time that we desperately need a national... Well, their fear of him is his greatest endorsement.
[02:03:29.384 --> 02:03:31.726]  And it wasn't some couched or pretend fear.
[02:03:32.306 --> 02:03:38.011]  It was a primal fear of gutless, empty, foppish, fake,
[02:03:39.494 --> 02:03:41.295]  Intellects.
[02:03:41.495 --> 02:03:45.618]  So I'm almost jealous because they hate me, but I'm jealous that they hate him more.
[02:03:46.078 --> 02:03:47.379]  Why do they hate Donald Trump?
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:48.600]  Can't control him.
[02:03:49.341 --> 02:03:51.142]  He's a billionaire we can't control.
[02:03:51.162 --> 02:03:58.127]  He has enormous wealth in which he can achieve things, but he doesn't buy into their mindset.
[02:03:58.607 --> 02:04:06.932]  Remember they tried to preempt him, the guy from the Council on Foreign Relations took him to lunch to explain everything they could do for him.
[02:04:06.952 --> 02:04:07.553]  Richard Haass.
[02:04:07.933 --> 02:04:10.174]  He came away completely unimpressed.
[02:04:10.595 --> 02:04:13.556]  Unimpressed and unmoved by their global view.
[02:04:14.157 --> 02:04:18.279]  So that attempt to preempt him, to co-opt him, completely failed.
[02:04:18.319 --> 02:04:23.522]  Those reviewers, we F Americans and sell their jobs to China, and we sit on boards with communist generals.
[02:04:24.202 --> 02:04:24.942]  You can have money.
[02:04:25.483 --> 02:04:29.205]  But they, let's face it, they dress it up a little better than that when they explain it.
[02:04:29.747 --> 02:04:39.250]  No, he can't be bullied, he can't be bought, he's not going to buy into any mindset that isn't pro-American.
[02:04:39.290 --> 02:04:49.954]  Well, we have to come back tomorrow, since you're here till tomorrow, and talk, since the live show continues on, about how they counter-strike, what they do, but the announcement should be made, here we are,
[02:04:50.834 --> 02:04:55.378]  I still feel like they might launch a war with Russia or claim that Russia stole this, but they tried to sell that.
[02:04:55.398 --> 02:04:56.038]  You're right, Roger.
[02:04:56.519 --> 02:04:57.480]  No one bought that.
[02:04:58.981 --> 02:05:01.683]  I mean, no one's buying into this.
[02:05:02.084 --> 02:05:03.805]  Let's go back to right-side broadcasting.
[02:05:04.285 --> 02:05:10.631]  Donald J. Trump, Owen Schroeder, pop in if you want, but this is a big time to be alive right now.
[02:05:11.451 --> 02:05:12.052]  Yes, indeed.
[02:05:12.192 --> 02:05:12.913]  What a great night.
[02:05:13.373 --> 02:05:16.075]  We have a lot of viewers tuned in right now, and it's 1.38 Eastern.
[02:05:19.150 --> 02:05:22.993]  Midnight at 38 minutes 25 seconds central.
[02:05:23.433 --> 02:05:26.515]  Let's put right side broadcasting on screen for TV viewers.
[02:05:26.555 --> 02:05:27.896]  It's all on Infowars.com.
[02:05:28.857 --> 02:05:30.498]  It's all on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:05:31.219 --> 02:05:32.700]  We have literal footage.
[02:05:33.940 --> 02:05:39.282]  Of Democrats that believe destroying men would bring them to Valhalla.
[02:05:39.863 --> 02:05:41.864]  Believing GMO would empower them.
[02:05:41.924 --> 02:05:44.845]  Believing that the state was their husband.
[02:05:45.385 --> 02:05:53.209]  These are women married to robots, look at them, who are discovering that the robot is not going to bring them to heaven.
[02:05:53.969 --> 02:06:07.367]  And you've got these people just groveling that this war criminal that destabilized Africa and robbed the Haitian money, their goddess, their god, who can barely walk, the perfect archetype of the failure.
[02:06:08.487 --> 02:06:11.409]  Is now not delivering them to nirvana.
[02:06:12.270 --> 02:06:13.370]  She gave them derivatives.
[02:06:13.411 --> 02:06:14.651]  She gave them bankruptcy.
[02:06:15.052 --> 02:06:15.992]  She gave them war.
[02:06:16.072 --> 02:06:17.233]  She gave them the Arab Spring.
[02:06:17.553 --> 02:06:20.295]  She gave them the murder and sexual exploitation of women.
[02:06:20.315 --> 02:06:21.716]  And they love her for it.
[02:06:21.736 --> 02:06:26.760]  Because in their cowardice, in their fear subconsciously, they worship the evil.
[02:06:27.340 --> 02:06:31.023]  And now their goddess has not delivered them more blood.
[02:06:31.623 --> 02:06:46.193]  Their goddess has not delivered them the hell on earth, the taking of the guns, living in Chicago, living in New York with 15 locks on their doors, being cowards, hen-pecking their men, putting their sons in mental institutions, having abortions.
[02:06:46.353 --> 02:06:56.320]  All their satanic glee's are now failing them and their squalor and their anti-liberal world as they attempt to destroy the Republican, attack the bitter clingers.
[02:06:56.720 --> 02:06:59.962]  Everything they believe in is falling, falling before them.
[02:07:00.322 --> 02:07:00.983]  Owen Schreier,
[02:07:01.783 --> 02:07:05.267]  As we watch these people who want to deliver us into hell, what do you say?
[02:07:06.088 --> 02:07:19.261]  Well Alex, let's not forget not just their goddess Hillary Clinton failing them, but their information source, their brainwashed source, their matrix that they plug into the mainstream news has completely failed them as well.
[02:07:19.942 --> 02:07:20.923]  Their God.
[02:07:22.096 --> 02:07:23.738]  Which has less viewers than we do.
[02:07:23.778 --> 02:07:24.699]  I'm nothing.
[02:07:24.799 --> 02:07:26.681]  It's like I'm better than you.
[02:07:27.262 --> 02:07:29.945]  Imagine CNN with billions spent a year.
[02:07:30.265 --> 02:07:31.746]  It's all a paper tiger.
[02:07:32.487 --> 02:07:34.910]  Continue Owen and Roger Stone.
[02:07:34.970 --> 02:07:36.051]  We're waiting for the big announcement here.
[02:07:36.271 --> 02:07:37.172]  Alex, think about this.
[02:07:37.958 --> 02:07:43.100]  So they're told the whole time, the mainstream media, telling these Clinton supporters that Trump is the worst guy ever.
[02:07:43.160 --> 02:07:43.701]  He's the bigot.
[02:07:43.741 --> 02:07:44.401]  They believe it.
[02:07:44.781 --> 02:07:47.302]  They see the optics in the polls and everything.
[02:07:47.362 --> 02:07:48.123]  Oh, Trump can't win.
[02:07:48.163 --> 02:07:48.643]  They buy it.
[02:07:48.683 --> 02:07:49.843]  They think they're on the winning team.
[02:07:50.124 --> 02:07:52.985]  These people, as you said, probably haven't accomplished much in their own lives.
[02:07:53.025 --> 02:07:55.106]  Probably don't have anything to be proud of in their own lives.
[02:07:55.126 --> 02:07:56.266]  So they get behind Clinton.
[02:07:56.486 --> 02:07:57.367]  They get behind this movement.
[02:07:57.387 --> 02:07:58.868]  They think that this is their winning movement.
[02:07:59.128 --> 02:08:00.268]  They follow the lying media.
[02:08:00.308 --> 02:08:00.888]  They've failed.
[02:08:01.109 --> 02:08:04.330]  The people that come to us, who have been called crazy, are now the victors.
[02:08:04.350 --> 02:08:05.230]  They're going to have their big night.
[02:08:05.250 --> 02:08:05.931]  But look at this, Alex.
[02:08:06.511 --> 02:08:08.672]  Pennsylvania, 99% reporting.
[02:08:08.752 --> 02:08:12.975]  I think we're going to know inside of a half hour the final tabulation on Pennsylvania.
[02:08:13.015 --> 02:08:15.116]  What is it right now at 99%?
[02:08:15.156 --> 02:08:15.116]  99%.
[02:08:15.216 --> 02:08:16.317]  Trump is up by 1%.
[02:08:16.357 --> 02:08:23.742]  He's up by, it looks like, about 70,000 or so votes.
[02:08:23.762 --> 02:08:27.704]  So, once they close Pennsylvania, if it goes to Trump, he'll have 264.
[02:08:27.784 --> 02:08:32.467]  That means all he has to do is win Michigan, Wisconsin, or Arizona.
[02:08:32.487 --> 02:08:34.048]  But he's an effing white male.
[02:08:35.049 --> 02:08:38.492]  Now, it's not racist to say all whites are bad, so I actually agree.
[02:08:38.512 --> 02:08:42.556]  I mean, you know, like they said, if we just didn't have white people, everything would be better.
[02:08:42.576 --> 02:08:50.783]  George Soros, the Nazi collaborator, said so, and after all, he has a son that can hardly walk.
[02:08:50.843 --> 02:08:53.165]  We're less than an hour away from this being official.
[02:08:53.205 --> 02:08:54.006]  What do you think, Roger?
[02:08:55.187 --> 02:08:56.408]  Definitely less than an hour.
[02:08:56.448 --> 02:09:01.273]  I'm trying to determine why the candidate has not moved to the podium to claim it.
[02:09:01.932 --> 02:09:08.500]  That would be my strong advice, but I don't see any way for her to break out of this and claim victory.
[02:09:08.761 --> 02:09:12.725]  He's dominated, he's got people and networks waiting.
[02:09:13.815 --> 02:09:16.697]  Let's go to Owen's talking and play some clips.
[02:09:16.717 --> 02:09:17.438]  Let's go make some calls.
[02:09:17.798 --> 02:09:18.999]  Let's get on this right now.
[02:09:19.079 --> 02:09:19.559]  Stay with us.
[02:09:19.820 --> 02:09:21.000]  So, Owen Schroer here.
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:22.482]  Thank you, Alex and Roger.
[02:09:22.502 --> 02:09:30.688]  They're going to go get the latest updates and see what we can get from the Trump headquarters when he plans on announcing victory.
[02:09:30.948 --> 02:09:31.628]  I'm ready to go.
[02:09:31.808 --> 02:09:39.494]  I'll wait for Donald to announce it before I celebrate with a cigar and me and Maggie pop our bottle of champagne.
[02:09:39.514 --> 02:09:39.814]  Hey!
[02:09:39.954 --> 02:09:40.875]  Yeah, you know.
[02:09:42.156 --> 02:09:44.057]  I think it's Roger said we're definitely within an hour.
[02:09:44.157 --> 02:09:48.898]  Pennsylvania will be announced under a half an hour and that'll put Trump at 264.
[02:09:49.138 --> 02:09:51.859]  That means all he needs is Michigan, Wisconsin, or Arizona.
[02:09:51.899 --> 02:09:58.300]  He's winning in all of those states and if he wins one of those three, which he's already winning in, it's over.
[02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:00.281]  I think that I'm looking here.
[02:10:01.061 --> 02:10:06.244]  Wisconsin, 96% reporting Trump is up by almost 100,000 votes.
[02:10:07.004 --> 02:10:13.687]  Michigan, 90% reporting Trump is up by, looks like about 80,000 votes.
[02:10:14.308 --> 02:10:22.792]  Arizona, 70, what is that, 76 or 70% reporting Trump is up by 60,000 votes there too.
[02:10:22.852 --> 02:10:29.835]  But all he has to do is win Wisconsin or Michigan if he can bag Pennsylvania officially under half hour.
[02:10:30.996 --> 02:10:32.158]  And then that's it, folks.
[02:10:32.198 --> 02:10:32.779]  That's over 270.
[02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:37.969]  Again, all he needs is two more states and Donald Trump is the victor.
[02:10:38.089 --> 02:10:39.692]  It looks like it's going to be a landslide.
[02:10:40.494 --> 02:10:42.878]  The landslide that the American people deserve.
[02:10:44.247 --> 02:10:45.027]  And it's amazing.
[02:10:45.047 --> 02:10:48.529]  This is the illustration of the failure of the mainstream media.
[02:10:48.549 --> 02:10:49.569]  The failure.
[02:10:49.589 --> 02:10:51.130]  You know, and here's another thing, too.
[02:10:51.850 --> 02:10:52.951]  Not just Hillary Clinton.
[02:10:52.971 --> 02:10:53.491]  Let's remember.
[02:10:53.771 --> 02:11:01.355]  Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Joe Biden, all of these shills have been campaigning for Hillary Clinton.
[02:11:01.615 --> 02:11:02.975]  And you failed, Barack.
[02:11:02.995 --> 02:11:03.195]  See?
[02:11:03.496 --> 02:11:04.116]  I love all these people.
[02:11:04.256 --> 02:11:05.236]  People love Barack.
[02:11:05.276 --> 02:11:05.837]  People love Barack.
[02:11:05.877 --> 02:11:07.557]  People can't stand Barack.
[02:11:07.777 --> 02:11:08.938]  He doesn't even do his job.
[02:11:09.198 --> 02:11:09.799]  I don't know.
[02:11:29.212 --> 02:11:31.833]  You haven't really seen him doing much about the economy lately.
[02:11:32.273 --> 02:11:38.256]  They try to puff it up saying, oh, look at all these new jobs, but full-time workers are down, part-time jobs are up.
[02:11:38.276 --> 02:11:39.896]  So they don't tell you how they skew those numbers.
[02:11:39.916 --> 02:11:40.377]  That's right.
[02:11:40.397 --> 02:11:45.939]  They're counting part-time jobs, these menial worker type positions.
[02:11:45.959 --> 02:11:49.200]  They're putting a lot in that pot that don't really belong there, actually.
[02:11:49.220 --> 02:11:50.601]  His poor legacy.
[02:11:51.499 --> 02:11:54.440]  So he's going to fail on the economy when he leaves the office.
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:11:56.520]  But who knows what happens with that.
[02:11:56.560 --> 02:11:57.561]  That could be out of Trump's hands.
[02:11:57.641 --> 02:12:08.103]  But I think that the true mark of failure on the Barack Obama legacy is truly the fact that he went all in for Hillary Clinton.
[02:12:08.644 --> 02:12:12.745]  He told black people if they didn't vote for Hillary Clinton, they were a letdown, basically.
[02:12:13.685 --> 02:12:19.367]  He said that if everything we worked for is on the ballot here, if you don't vote Clinton, then everything we worked for is being reversed.
[02:12:19.387 --> 02:12:20.527]  So again, this shows you.
[02:12:21.127 --> 02:12:23.247]  Barack, nobody likes you.
[02:12:23.467 --> 02:12:26.508]  Nobody actually wants to get behind what you work for.
[02:12:26.908 --> 02:12:29.709]  Nobody cares about your opinion and your empty threats.
[02:12:29.929 --> 02:12:30.229]  That's right.
[02:12:30.249 --> 02:12:31.629]  Or empty personal attacks.
[02:12:31.669 --> 02:12:32.129]  You failed.
[02:12:32.149 --> 02:12:34.230]  The arrogance of him to lecture people.
[02:12:34.270 --> 02:12:35.430]  You know, he did this with Brexit.
[02:12:35.450 --> 02:12:36.390]  He went to the UK, lectured them.
[02:12:36.410 --> 02:12:37.950]  They just declared Pennsylvania.
[02:12:37.970 --> 02:12:40.931]  New York Times has just declared Pennsylvania.
[02:12:40.951 --> 02:12:43.652]  Donald Trump is now at 264.
[02:12:43.992 --> 02:12:48.212]  We are waiting for one more state to go to Donald Trump, Michigan or Wisconsin.
[02:12:48.332 --> 02:12:49.573]  And it's over, folks.
[02:12:49.933 --> 02:12:50.513]  It's over.
[02:12:52.386 --> 02:12:53.786]  And here is what we have.
[02:12:54.047 --> 02:12:55.927]  Again, let me see here.
[02:12:55.967 --> 02:13:01.569]  Wisconsin, it looks like we've got 96 reporting.
[02:13:02.169 --> 02:13:03.730]  Donald Trump is... It's over.
[02:13:04.250 --> 02:13:04.950]  It's over, folks.
[02:13:05.531 --> 02:13:05.891]  It's over.
[02:13:06.771 --> 02:13:07.931]  Can we look at Wisconsin?
[02:13:08.011 --> 02:13:09.012]  Look at Wisconsin, folks.
[02:13:09.052 --> 02:13:09.412]  It's over.
[02:13:09.932 --> 02:13:10.352]  It's over.
[02:13:11.993 --> 02:13:13.553]  When is Trump coming on the podium?
[02:13:20.848 --> 02:13:21.949]  We did it, America!
[02:13:22.469 --> 02:13:23.029]  We did it!
[02:13:23.069 --> 02:13:24.030]  Give me some skin, Owen.
[02:13:24.050 --> 02:13:25.791]  Give me some skin.
[02:13:26.011 --> 02:13:30.454]  And this is, I'm gonna tell you, the whole world is watching right now.
[02:13:30.774 --> 02:13:32.255]  The whole world is seeing this.
[02:13:32.515 --> 02:13:36.478]  The whole world sees that the American people are no longer asleep.
[02:13:36.698 --> 02:13:40.480]  The American people no longer have their heads buried in Kim Kardashian's butt.
[02:13:40.740 --> 02:13:43.962]  They no longer have their heads buried in the sports plantation.
[02:13:44.163 --> 02:13:45.163]  We are back!
[02:13:45.463 --> 02:13:46.344]  We are back!
[02:13:46.664 --> 02:13:49.306]  The bastion of freedom and liberty and justice!
[02:13:49.466 --> 02:13:51.126]  The United States is back!
[02:13:51.427 --> 02:13:53.108]  Donald Trump is our president!
[02:13:53.348 --> 02:13:54.788]  Screw you, establishment!
[02:13:54.949 --> 02:13:56.049]  You thought you could beat us?
[02:13:56.189 --> 02:13:56.930]  You failed!
[02:13:57.150 --> 02:13:59.431]  You underestimated the American people again!
[02:13:59.451 --> 02:14:01.432]  I dare you to underestimate us again!
[02:14:01.452 --> 02:14:02.653]  I dare you!
[02:14:02.693 --> 02:14:06.415]  That will be the death of you if this Donald Trump presidency isn't already!
[02:14:09.767 --> 02:14:17.772]  Speaking of the death of things, okay, so when she gives her little concession speech, do you think she's gonna get into her little medical paddy wagon?
[02:14:17.952 --> 02:14:19.993]  Where's she gonna go?
[02:14:20.013 --> 02:14:20.413]  You know what?
[02:14:20.433 --> 02:14:22.195]  That was a great point by Roger Stone.
[02:14:22.355 --> 02:14:25.817]  I wonder what this concession speech will sound like because...
[02:14:28.228 --> 02:14:30.752]  She's not, I mean, we know she's entitled.
[02:14:30.772 --> 02:14:31.834]  She doesn't take responsibility very well.
[02:14:31.854 --> 02:14:32.154]  Exactly.
[02:14:32.194 --> 02:14:34.418]  She doesn't take not getting her way very well.
[02:14:34.498 --> 02:14:41.649]  So, will we see the demon Hillary come out with a concession speech pointing and cackling and HA!
[02:14:41.989 --> 02:14:42.370]  HA!
[02:14:42.710 --> 02:14:42.931]  HA!
[02:14:43.511 --> 02:14:48.115]  Or will we see Hillary Clinton come down off of her high horse?
[02:14:48.196 --> 02:14:49.857]  Come down off of her fake podium?
[02:14:49.877 --> 02:14:50.998]  That's not going to happen.
[02:14:51.298 --> 02:14:52.980]  Let's take option two off the table.
[02:14:53.340 --> 02:15:01.388]  A more plausible option for two is that the devil incarnate actually separates from her body and it just literally disintegrates on the floor.
[02:15:01.448 --> 02:15:02.349]  That would be option two.
[02:15:02.609 --> 02:15:03.490]  What was option one again?
[02:15:03.550 --> 02:15:04.371]  Blame everybody?
[02:15:04.391 --> 02:15:05.131]  That's more likely.
[02:15:05.151 --> 02:15:06.653]  Yeah, you know, just get up there, cackle.
[02:15:07.854 --> 02:15:08.954]  The Russians hacked it!
[02:15:09.235 --> 02:15:10.195]  Donald Trump lied!
[02:15:10.335 --> 02:15:11.356]  We need a recount!
[02:15:11.596 --> 02:15:13.638]  Why didn't I win by 50 points?
[02:15:13.918 --> 02:15:15.539]  I should be up by 50 points!
[02:15:15.759 --> 02:15:17.821]  My media told you Trump was a racist!
[02:15:18.041 --> 02:15:19.842]  My media told you Trump was a bigot!
[02:15:20.102 --> 02:15:21.143]  Trump hates Mexicans!
[02:15:21.343 --> 02:15:22.584]  Didn't you hear my media?
[02:15:22.804 --> 02:15:24.265]  Didn't you follow my campaign?
[02:15:24.565 --> 02:15:25.406]  How did I lose?
[02:15:28.248 --> 02:15:30.410]  And then maybe she'll just pass out right there on stage.
[02:15:30.590 --> 02:15:32.611]  They'll have to wheel her out on some sort of gurney.
[02:15:32.952 --> 02:15:36.995]  And then Rachel Maddow will come on air and say, Clinton's in the greatest health ever!
[02:15:38.036 --> 02:15:38.376]  Look at her!
[02:15:38.416 --> 02:15:39.557]  She's magnificent!
[02:15:39.737 --> 02:15:42.699]  She's taken the loss with such dignity and such grace!
[02:15:43.019 --> 02:15:51.226]  As she passes out and faints and cackles like the Wicked Witch of the West on air, you'll still have the Rachel Maddows of the world saying, she took this loss gracefully.
[02:15:51.466 --> 02:15:53.888]  Look at the grace of Hillary Clinton, the dignity.
[02:15:54.088 --> 02:15:56.410]  This woman is a thief, a lying,
[02:15:56.730 --> 02:15:59.992]  And a criminal, and the American people did not elect her.
[02:16:00.072 --> 02:16:01.153]  Thank God!
[02:16:01.173 --> 02:16:02.734]  Thank God!
[02:16:02.794 --> 02:16:07.657]  The entire world is just thanking God that Hillary Clinton did not win.
[02:16:07.677 --> 02:16:08.057]  That's right.
[02:16:08.077 --> 02:16:08.837]  You miss the whole world.
[02:16:08.877 --> 02:16:10.178]  This isn't just about America.
[02:16:10.218 --> 02:16:12.119]  This is about the globe here.
[02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:17.743]  And, you know, I was looking at some tweets, you know, coming out, even comments that we get on YouTube sometimes.
[02:16:18.143 --> 02:16:21.185]  They're not all, they're sometimes, you know, many cases, they're not American.
[02:16:21.946 --> 02:16:23.407]  They're watching us from other countries.
[02:16:23.487 --> 02:16:26.932]  This is going to set the tone, and there's going to be a ripple effect.
[02:16:26.972 --> 02:16:30.756]  But go back to her concession speech for me, because that's so amusing.
[02:16:30.816 --> 02:16:31.397]  Well, we'll see.
[02:16:31.437 --> 02:16:32.078]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:16:32.098 --> 02:16:33.219]  I love it when you do that.
[02:16:33.239 --> 02:16:35.923]  If she gets up there... It's very animated in here.
[02:16:37.279 --> 02:16:45.001]  If Hillary Clinton gets up there and really tries to blame the Russians, or blame this, or not take this gracefully... You know what this is like?
[02:16:45.121 --> 02:16:46.242]  I lived in Russia.
[02:16:46.842 --> 02:16:47.622]  Russian reporter!
[02:16:47.642 --> 02:16:48.582]  I lived in Russia.
[02:16:48.602 --> 02:16:58.485]  To hear the absurdity of these claims that this crazy lunatic was making over the past two months, it's so hard to even report it back because you think she's joking.
[02:16:58.985 --> 02:17:01.046]  You know, you're like, this has got to be a comedy skit.
[02:17:01.066 --> 02:17:02.106]  This isn't reality.
[02:17:02.126 --> 02:17:04.988]  So, you know, I'm in the studio right now.
[02:17:05.048 --> 02:17:09.349]  We can't monitor the news, but people are telling me right now, CNN is crying on air.
[02:17:09.910 --> 02:17:11.430]  MSNBC is crying on air.
[02:17:11.470 --> 02:17:12.711]  They don't know what to do.
[02:17:13.131 --> 02:17:13.931]  They are shocked.
[02:17:13.971 --> 02:17:15.172]  Their propaganda failed.
[02:17:15.212 --> 02:17:16.252]  Their arrogance failed.
[02:17:16.492 --> 02:17:18.853]  You don't control me, you sons of bitches!
[02:17:18.873 --> 02:17:19.874]  Don't you get it, CNN?
[02:17:19.894 --> 02:17:21.534]  Don't you get it, MSNBC?
[02:17:21.774 --> 02:17:22.735]  Don't you get it, Obama?
[02:17:22.995 --> 02:17:24.355]  You don't control me!
[02:17:24.616 --> 02:17:25.616]  You don't owe me!
[02:17:25.936 --> 02:17:26.516]  Screw you!
[02:17:28.277 --> 02:17:29.918]  That's Donald Trump in the office!
[02:17:30.299 --> 02:17:31.099]  Screw you!
[02:17:31.900 --> 02:17:33.121]  I'm ready to celebrate this.
[02:17:33.241 --> 02:17:35.683]  We are waiting for the results here, folks.
[02:17:36.543 --> 02:17:40.086]  All we need is Michigan or Wisconsin to be announced, and it's over.
[02:17:40.106 --> 02:17:40.426]  I've got my map.
[02:17:40.446 --> 02:17:44.249]  I think Trump wins 305 to 233 at the end of the night, but we're still waiting on the results of Wisconsin.
[02:17:53.266 --> 02:17:54.127]  Or Michigan.
[02:17:54.267 --> 02:17:56.188]  If he wins either one of those, it's over.
[02:17:56.348 --> 02:18:00.110]  Right now, they're giving Donald Trump 264 electoral votes.
[02:18:00.611 --> 02:18:02.772]  They just gave him Pennsylvania.
[02:18:03.172 --> 02:18:07.095]  At the beginning of the night, CNN was talking about how shocked they were.
[02:18:07.155 --> 02:18:11.197]  They were shocked that Donald Trump was going to win the Rust Belt!
[02:18:11.598 --> 02:18:11.978]  Oh my goodness!
[02:18:12.018 --> 02:18:12.898]  Do you think anybody's getting fired?
[02:18:13.299 --> 02:18:13.619]  Anybody?
[02:18:13.979 --> 02:18:14.760]  They're all fired.
[02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:15.441]  That's what this is.
[02:18:15.461 --> 02:18:16.222]  You're all fired.
[02:18:16.262 --> 02:18:17.963]  Whose head's gonna roll is my question.
[02:18:18.084 --> 02:18:24.791]  So, but then they were saying, oh, he was counting on Pennsylvania as the anchor and he didn't get it.
[02:18:24.811 --> 02:18:26.473]  Oh, wait, he did.
[02:18:26.973 --> 02:18:28.735]  He did get Pennsylvania, didn't he?
[02:18:29.095 --> 02:18:29.436]  Wow.
[02:18:30.370 --> 02:18:36.454]  There's no responsibility, so you could be this wrong and lie and lie and lie and fall on your face, but nothing happens to you?
[02:18:36.494 --> 02:18:37.555]  You just keep going?
[02:18:37.575 --> 02:18:38.715]  Well, they're shocked, don't you see?
[02:18:38.775 --> 02:18:39.296]  They're shocked.
[02:18:39.616 --> 02:18:40.456]  Who could have predicted?
[02:18:40.977 --> 02:18:41.657]  Who could have known?
[02:18:41.677 --> 02:18:44.199]  Oh wait, the kook Alex Jones?
[02:18:44.219 --> 02:18:45.079]  The kook Alex Jones!
[02:18:45.099 --> 02:18:47.901]  That you call a conspiracy theorist was right again?
[02:18:47.921 --> 02:18:49.642]  How is this possible?
[02:18:49.782 --> 02:18:51.684]  Alex Jones was right again!
[02:18:51.704 --> 02:18:52.444]  Oh my God!
[02:18:55.186 --> 02:18:57.127]  CNN is wrong again!
[02:18:57.467 --> 02:18:58.848]  Oh my lord!
[02:19:00.988 --> 02:19:01.889]  Just waiting, folks.
[02:19:02.589 --> 02:19:05.550]  You know, she might mention Alex in the concession speech.
[02:19:05.630 --> 02:19:10.892]  I would not be shocked a bit if Hillary Clinton mentions Alex Jones in her concession speech.
[02:19:10.952 --> 02:19:11.813]  Here's the deal, Hillary.
[02:19:12.453 --> 02:19:13.113]  The dark heart.
[02:19:13.293 --> 02:19:14.094]  The dark heart!
[02:19:14.114 --> 02:19:14.654]  The dark heart.
[02:19:14.794 --> 02:19:15.854]  Of course, we're all deplorable.
[02:19:15.874 --> 02:19:16.755]  We all have dark hearts.
[02:19:16.795 --> 02:19:17.795]  I wonder if she'll mention that.
[02:19:17.835 --> 02:19:19.316]  The deplorables kept her out of office.
[02:19:19.716 --> 02:19:20.937]  We tipped over the apple cart!
[02:19:21.337 --> 02:19:23.398]  We didn't, you did listening to us.
[02:19:23.538 --> 02:19:25.239]  I mean, I'm so proud of us!
[02:19:25.419 --> 02:19:26.880]  Us, the collective America!
[02:19:26.920 --> 02:19:28.081]  Thank you, that's a great point.
[02:19:28.121 --> 02:19:35.084]  You out there listening, you the info warriors, you that took action in this election cycle, you that voted, that's the true victory here.
[02:19:35.245 --> 02:19:36.705]  It's all of us, it's not just Trump.
[02:19:36.946 --> 02:19:38.446]  And that's what Trump is going to say, I bet.
[02:19:38.927 --> 02:19:41.548]  When he gives his victory speech, he's going to say, it was all you.
[02:19:42.489 --> 02:19:46.511]  Okay, so, here's the deal folks, we're waiting on the announcement, but,

[02:20:04.865 --> 02:20:06.026]  Defensive Liberty Special.
[02:20:06.446 --> 02:20:08.388]  Survival Shield X2 is my favorite product.

[02:20:43.893 --> 02:20:45.334]  Actually, I need some brain force.
[02:20:45.814 --> 02:20:48.375]  And I am in love with the B12, the shield.
[02:20:48.475 --> 02:20:49.076]  You do like the B12.

[02:21:05.343 --> 02:21:07.744]  They cannot believe that they don't control America.
[02:21:08.284 --> 02:21:10.785]  So, who knows how they might respond?
[02:21:10.825 --> 02:21:12.386]  Hillary Clinton is a crazed lunatic.
[02:21:12.406 --> 02:21:14.087]  The people that control her are psychopaths.
[02:21:15.247 --> 02:21:21.028]  I hope that you don't need storable food in the coming days, but let's be real, it could be something that becomes very important.

[02:21:45.913 --> 02:21:51.056]  This might need to become the number one selling t-shirt in the world right here.
[02:21:52.097 --> 02:21:53.458]  Trump is my president.
[02:21:53.538 --> 02:21:54.719]  Infowarsstore.com
[02:21:56.007 --> 02:21:57.789]  Infowars.com, legalize freedom.

[02:22:06.196 --> 02:22:08.077]  Trump is my president.
[02:22:08.137 --> 02:22:11.400]  And it looks like it's going to be official very soon.
[02:22:11.440 --> 02:22:13.162]  This is basically at cost, folks.
[02:22:13.202 --> 02:22:14.303]  Ten bucks you can get this shirt.
[02:22:14.803 --> 02:22:16.505]  Where else can you get a shirt for ten bucks?
[02:22:17.930 --> 02:22:18.610]  The flea market?
[02:22:18.691 --> 02:22:20.492]  That's probably the only place we can get another shirt for $10.
[02:22:20.952 --> 02:22:22.433]  We got it at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:22:22.753 --> 02:22:23.614]  Trump is my president.
[02:22:24.114 --> 02:22:24.695]  Free shipping.
[02:22:25.435 --> 02:22:29.778]  So, 264 votes, electoral votes for Trump right now.
[02:22:30.939 --> 02:22:32.520]  Michigan, let's see where we stand.
[02:22:33.481 --> 02:22:35.162]  We've got 92% reporting in Michigan.
[02:22:38.795 --> 02:22:42.558]  And Trump is up by 70,000 votes.
[02:22:42.798 --> 02:22:45.020]  So, we're still keeping an eye on this.
[02:22:45.321 --> 02:22:47.442]  Trump is in the lead, 70,000.
[02:22:48.163 --> 02:22:51.206]  But, we still have 8% of the votes to be counted.
[02:22:51.706 --> 02:22:55.589]  Wisconsin, 96% have reported.
[02:22:56.230 --> 02:23:01.354]  Donald Trump is winning by, looks like about 60,000 votes there too.
[02:23:02.095 --> 02:23:04.917]  So this is the one, I guess we'll keep our eye on here.
[02:23:04.957 --> 02:23:06.699]  It looks like this one is going to be closed.
[02:23:07.950 --> 02:23:10.312]  Sooner than... Look at this thing.
[02:23:10.592 --> 02:23:15.296]  The massive amount of red and you've got these tiny little pockets of blue.
[02:23:15.316 --> 02:23:16.377]  Well, this is how it always works.
[02:23:16.417 --> 02:23:17.398]  It's like this everywhere.
[02:23:17.438 --> 02:23:25.825]  Historically, Wisconsin, in western and southwestern Wisconsin, that typically goes blue.
[02:23:26.466 --> 02:23:29.568]  Tonight we're seeing most of these counties are going red.
[02:23:29.608 --> 02:23:31.110]  So that's a major sea change.
[02:23:31.950 --> 02:23:37.878]  But when you talk about these little blurbs on the map, what you're talking about is all of the inner cities always go blue.
[02:23:37.898 --> 02:23:39.581]  This is how the Democrats rig the election.
[02:23:39.941 --> 02:23:42.905]  They get the inner cities on the Democratic plantation.
[02:23:42.945 --> 02:23:44.547]  That's how they rig the vote.
[02:23:45.609 --> 02:23:49.274]  Pennsylvania and Missouri are always the best example of this.
[02:23:49.554 --> 02:23:52.356]  Those poor people of Flint, by the way, if we could just go back.
[02:23:52.716 --> 02:23:55.998]  Michigan, they said, he could never take Michigan.
[02:23:56.018 --> 02:24:02.903]  Do you remember, even yesterday, you know, how absurd is it, the audacity of him to even go and try, you know, the last-ditch effort?
[02:24:03.924 --> 02:24:08.167]  It's basically solid red, except for these tiny little pockets of blue down at the bottom.
[02:24:08.487 --> 02:24:12.510]  Of course, the poor people of Flint, you know, there's a deception over that city.
[02:24:12.530 --> 02:24:13.270]  It's gone blue.
[02:24:13.290 --> 02:24:15.552]  They apparently haven't suffered enough.
[02:24:18.956 --> 02:24:20.477]  Hey, that's our live screen up there, Margaret.
[02:24:20.557 --> 02:24:20.917]  Okay.
[02:24:22.899 --> 02:24:24.099]  This is my screen down here.
[02:24:24.119 --> 02:24:24.620]  That's the screen.
[02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:26.761]  I love, I prefer your ears.
[02:24:29.263 --> 02:24:31.904]  So again, Michigan, 92% reporting.
[02:24:31.944 --> 02:24:33.906]  We're just taking a look at some of these counties here.
[02:24:34.706 --> 02:24:42.831]  What is the name of the county in Michigan that is apparently like heavy Muslim?
[02:24:43.452 --> 02:24:44.412]  Do you know the name of that county?
[02:24:44.432 --> 02:24:45.293]  Dearborn, Michigan.
[02:24:45.473 --> 02:24:45.973]  Dearborn?
[02:24:46.033 --> 02:24:46.614]  Is that a county?
[02:24:46.634 --> 02:24:47.394]  I don't think it's the county.
[02:24:47.414 --> 02:24:48.255]  I think it's the area.
[02:24:49.164 --> 02:24:50.304]  I'd be interested to see.
[02:24:52.545 --> 02:24:54.206]  Let's find out where Dearborn County is.
[02:24:54.286 --> 02:24:55.507]  Isn't it outside of Detroit?
[02:24:55.527 --> 02:24:57.427]  I'm going to make sure.
[02:25:02.289 --> 02:25:04.050]  I'm just waiting for the announcement.
[02:25:04.090 --> 02:25:10.193]  I think that Donald is going to wait for either one of these states to close its polls or have 100% reported.
[02:25:10.293 --> 02:25:10.713]  So let's see here.
[02:25:16.169 --> 02:25:20.618]  Dearborn, it looks like, yeah, just west of Detroit.
[02:25:23.243 --> 02:25:25.207]  So Dearborn, of course, went for Hillary Clinton.
[02:25:25.468 --> 02:25:26.249]  No surprise there.
[02:25:27.185 --> 02:25:40.173]  You would think that her, um, you know, feeding that question about Flint and their massive water crisis, their massive poverty, you know, dire situation happening, that they wouldn't have gone black kind of shocks me.
[02:25:40.653 --> 02:25:50.800]  So I'm looking at these counties right now, the precincts with Trump's visit to Flint, the precincts in Wisconsin right now, the major democratic precincts are almost all turned in.
[02:25:50.820 --> 02:25:50.860]  So.
[02:25:53.928 --> 02:25:57.609]  It appears that the majority of precincts, well maybe it's about even here actually.
[02:25:58.349 --> 02:26:06.431]  So it's about even with the precincts we're waiting on right now out of Wisconsin between red and blue areas.
[02:26:06.551 --> 02:26:07.251]  It's about even.
[02:26:07.311 --> 02:26:11.932]  So I would guess that this is going to continue at this rate.
[02:26:11.992 --> 02:26:14.072]  Trump is probably going to win by a small percentage.
[02:26:15.013 --> 02:26:16.533]  But right now we are at now 97%.
[02:26:16.573 --> 02:26:17.113]  97% reported if you
[02:26:22.912 --> 02:26:28.457]  Count on the same kind of time frame as far as how we get the results in.
[02:26:28.477 --> 02:26:34.222]  I would imagine we've got about 30 minutes till they call this for Trump.
[02:26:35.142 --> 02:26:41.428]  I would say about 30 minutes until this is 100% reported and this one goes for Trump.
[02:26:41.448 --> 02:26:43.169]  You know, we got a great staff back here.
[02:26:43.830 --> 02:26:48.173]  I'm glad that they've been working so much over the last couple days to keep us live on air.
[02:26:49.227 --> 02:26:51.289]  And Infowarsstore.com is how you support us.
[02:26:51.309 --> 02:26:53.091]  That's how we pay all these great members of the staff.
[02:26:53.111 --> 02:26:56.315]  So we are starting to get some early results for Alaska.
[02:26:56.475 --> 02:26:57.396]  That's going for Trump.
[02:26:57.636 --> 02:26:59.978]  I think they did just declare Hawaii for Clinton.
[02:27:00.199 --> 02:27:01.079]  No surprise there.
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:03.282]  But that's a small electoral vote.
[02:27:03.702 --> 02:27:06.825]  It all, at this point, is coming down to three states.
[02:27:08.038 --> 02:27:09.778]  Michigan, Wisconsin, and Arizona.
[02:27:10.219 --> 02:27:14.080]  If Donald Trump gets one of those, it's over.
[02:27:14.260 --> 02:27:17.901]  And of course, right now, the one we're waiting on is Wisconsin.
[02:27:17.921 --> 02:27:21.242]  10 electoral votes, that'll put Donald Trump to 274.
[02:27:22.522 --> 02:27:26.463]  97% reported right now in Wisconsin.
[02:27:26.483 --> 02:27:29.664]  You know, I didn't even see Jill Stein on any of these maps.
[02:27:31.304 --> 02:27:34.125]  I'm not sure, I guess she didn't get on the ballot in a lot of these states.
[02:27:36.624 --> 02:27:43.930]  Evan McMullin got 21% of the vote in Utah, almost as much as Hillary Clinton.
[02:27:45.371 --> 02:27:49.614]  So you can see there, Clinton not very popular, although the number of votes were relatively close.
[02:27:49.654 --> 02:27:53.557]  Trump is going to win by over 100,000 though, is what that appears.
[02:27:53.597 --> 02:27:55.779]  Should be a comfortable victory, 63% reported.
[02:27:56.219 --> 02:27:58.942]  Another number to keep an eye on here.
[02:28:00.203 --> 02:28:06.186]  As we've probably got, let's see, California 37 percent reporting, Nevada 52, Oregon 79.
[02:28:07.027 --> 02:28:08.608]  Oregon, those are all mail-in ballots.
[02:28:09.928 --> 02:28:11.429]  Hillary Clinton is going to win Oregon.
[02:28:11.869 --> 02:28:13.731]  Hillary Clinton will win Washington, no surprise there.
[02:28:15.011 --> 02:28:17.332]  But Trump right now has 56 million, 100
[02:28:20.154 --> 02:28:20.555]  40,857 votes.
[02:28:20.615 --> 02:28:25.101]  We've still got a lot of votes being counted, but last year Barack Obama won the election with 62,615,406
[02:28:36.477 --> 02:28:44.059]  So let's keep an eye on the final tally of votes to see what Trump gets compared to Obama.
[02:28:44.139 --> 02:28:51.022]  Again, Trump at 56.1 million right now, with most of the West Coast still being tabulated.
[02:28:51.122 --> 02:28:58.424]  Obama won with 62.6 million last year, beating Romney by 3 million.
[02:28:58.444 --> 02:28:58.864]  Margaret Howell?
[02:28:59.562 --> 02:29:06.926]  Look, I think we should also give Clinton's vote count, her number, just to be, you know, we want to be on the up and up and we want to report everything that we're seeing.
[02:29:06.987 --> 02:29:13.370]  So this has her standing at 54,900, roughly 900,000 and he's at 56 million.
[02:29:13.430 --> 02:29:17.833]  So obviously we know that these numbers, they've hyped them up greatly for her.
[02:29:19.474 --> 02:29:24.537]  But even, you know, do you think our audience cares about this?
[02:29:24.557 --> 02:29:26.238]  Am I giving too much information about her?
[02:29:26.258 --> 02:29:26.618]  I don't know.
[02:29:26.939 --> 02:29:27.739]  But anyway, they've got her at 47.1%.
[02:29:30.100 --> 02:29:31.260]  It's not shocking, that part.
[02:29:33.101 --> 02:29:36.341]  Well, the West Coast always goes blue, so there was no surprise there.
[02:29:36.641 --> 02:29:39.222]  We did have reports that Trump was winning Washington early.
[02:29:40.262 --> 02:29:50.085]  Obviously, that is not how that ended up going once they started counting Seattle and Olympia and northwestern Whatcom County up there, too.
[02:29:50.125 --> 02:29:51.825]  He did take a great part of the state, though.
[02:29:52.415 --> 02:29:53.356]  Well again, this is typical.
[02:29:53.376 --> 02:30:00.125]  If you break these elections down by counties, folks, you can look at like, you can look at the majority of American elections.
[02:30:00.185 --> 02:30:06.714]  If you break it down by counties, 90% of the United States goes red every election cycle.
[02:30:07.495 --> 02:30:18.141]  How the Democrats rig the election is they have the inner cities, the poor population in the inner cities, where the density is, the population density is in the inner cities.
[02:30:18.541 --> 02:30:33.109]  This is how they, I mean, I guess they, you know, you could say they rig it with dead voters, illegal voters, but this is how they rig it with the electoral college system, by dominating the population density areas in the inner cities, having them on the Democratic plantation,
[02:30:33.829 --> 02:30:39.133]  And then, at the end of the day though, you'll see that 90% of America actually goes red.
[02:30:40.013 --> 02:30:41.655]  We're being interrupted with a great American break here.
[02:30:41.675 --> 02:30:42.715]  I'm sorry, what was that Marcos?
[02:30:42.755 --> 02:30:44.997]  I'm letting you know this right now.
[02:30:45.097 --> 02:30:46.498]  It's all over the internet right now.
[02:30:46.838 --> 02:30:49.760]  The number one trending thing is Trump is my president.
[02:30:50.100 --> 02:30:51.041]  It is officially over.
[02:30:51.081 --> 02:30:53.463]  Pennsylvania has been called.
[02:30:53.543 --> 02:30:56.445]  By the way, the number one trender... Fox News is refusing to call right now.
[02:30:56.465 --> 02:30:58.867]  A lot of people are refusing to call right now.
[02:30:59.107 --> 02:31:01.929]  Who came up with an idea two months ago for a t-shirt, Trump is my president?
[02:31:02.649 --> 02:31:03.810]  Where is your shirt, guys?
[02:31:03.830 --> 02:31:07.933]  We happen to have a red t-shirt of that same name, like, only for President.
[02:31:07.973 --> 02:31:11.795]  I don't know where these memes come from, but they're at Infowarstore.com.
[02:31:11.835 --> 02:31:16.659]  And by the way, we need to sell a crap ton of those to pay for all this.
[02:31:17.386 --> 02:31:19.387]  We have free shipping, InfowarsStore.com.
[02:31:20.448 --> 02:31:21.028]  34% off right now.
[02:31:21.048 --> 02:31:23.369]  Funding ourselves, the model of the future.
[02:31:23.749 --> 02:31:24.630]  Thank you for all the support.
[02:31:24.670 --> 02:31:25.530]  This is because of you.
[02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:28.411]  Free shipping, InfowarsStore.com.
[02:31:28.431 --> 02:31:28.631]  60% off.
[02:31:28.852 --> 02:31:29.672]  Trump is my president.
[02:31:30.132 --> 02:31:32.273]  And we do that because we don't want to sell 5,000.
[02:31:34.254 --> 02:31:36.876]  I want to discount it and sell it for $100,000.
[02:31:38.196 --> 02:31:50.643]  Let's mention that the iconic Trump rape t-shirt, which will end up in the Smithsonian, can still be gotten at the Infowars.com site or at the Stone Cold Truth site.
[02:31:51.003 --> 02:31:55.005]  You want one of these shirts, you want to hand it down to your grandchildren.
[02:31:55.345 --> 02:31:55.765]  That's right.
[02:31:55.845 --> 02:31:56.145]  Okay.
[02:31:56.786 --> 02:31:58.207]  You've talked to the Trump campaign.
[02:31:58.827 --> 02:31:59.707]  They're still holding off.
[02:31:59.767 --> 02:32:03.229]  It's one o'clock central and five minutes, so it's 1.05.
[02:32:03.649 --> 02:32:04.830]  It's 2.05 Eastern.
[02:32:06.291 --> 02:32:08.812]  Fox was just, we were in there saying, okay, Trump's clearly won.
[02:32:09.292 --> 02:32:10.273]  CNN's having a minute.
[02:32:10.293 --> 02:32:12.414]  They look like they're on death's doorstep.
[02:32:12.434 --> 02:32:13.415]  They're totally panicking.
[02:32:14.415 --> 02:32:16.196]  When is Trump going to announce the big victory?
[02:32:16.256 --> 02:32:21.199]  Is there any way to put it on screen with the Electoral College that she could still win?
[02:32:22.281 --> 02:32:23.882]  Well, that's an interesting point.
[02:32:24.022 --> 02:32:32.128]  I just heard from one of my contacts, one of the things that should be done by the Trump people immediately is to go out and check their electors.
[02:32:32.188 --> 02:32:41.414]  Remember, at the time that they filed their electors was very, very early in the campaign, before the campaign had reached critical mass.
[02:32:42.315 --> 02:32:47.598]  While it is unlikely that you would have chicanery there, it is well worth checking.
[02:32:47.879 --> 02:32:48.179]  Thank you.
[02:32:49.847 --> 02:32:51.107]  I need a coffee too, but whatever.
[02:32:51.127 --> 02:32:52.968]  I haven't been up since 6 a.m.
[02:32:53.008 --> 02:32:53.708]  This is amazing.
[02:32:53.748 --> 02:32:54.748]  This crew is amazing.
[02:32:55.168 --> 02:32:55.968]  What's happening is amazing.
[02:32:55.988 --> 02:32:57.309]  Let's go to Right Side Broadcasting.
[02:32:57.609 --> 02:32:59.769]  We have the feed, Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:33:00.929 --> 02:33:02.690]  I haven't checked since a few hours ago.
[02:33:02.990 --> 02:33:06.690]  We've had 26 million viewers in the last 30 hours.
[02:33:07.231 --> 02:33:09.271]  We're going to be going until tomorrow, 3 p.m.
[02:33:09.331 --> 02:33:10.811]  Central, live with the same stream.
[02:33:11.211 --> 02:33:13.672]  And we're going to do Nightly News too, so we're going to be past that.
[02:33:15.743 --> 02:33:19.128]  Again, it's important because they have the con game going to keep announcing.
[02:33:19.629 --> 02:33:22.032]  Drudge Report has 100 million visitors every few days.
[02:33:22.493 --> 02:33:23.454]  We have tens of millions.
[02:33:23.915 --> 02:33:25.617]  On our videos, we have tens of millions every day.
[02:33:26.038 --> 02:33:27.420]  You are a fraud.
[02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:29.082]  You are a joke.
[02:33:29.543 --> 02:33:30.844]  The people don't believe you.
[02:33:31.425 --> 02:33:32.785]  And that's why we're here pointing that out.
[02:33:32.805 --> 02:33:36.386]  Not to say, oh my God, we've got like a foot-long ding-dong or something.
[02:33:36.767 --> 02:33:51.611]  We're pointing this out because they are posing as real journalist organizations when they've been caught, run by the White House, run by Hillary, faking polls, faking questions, doing what they're told, and the world would accept that.
[02:33:53.246 --> 02:33:54.167]  Except you're not winners.
[02:33:54.527 --> 02:33:55.928]  You don't have an audience on top of it.
[02:33:56.369 --> 02:33:59.671]  You are GD frauds, Roger Stone.
[02:33:59.872 --> 02:34:01.313]  Well, it's because of what they're selling.
[02:34:01.693 --> 02:34:08.299]  I mean, they're not... They're selling communist horse shit while they're the ones that are making all this money.
[02:34:09.039 --> 02:34:09.680]  In the last...
[02:34:10.882 --> 02:34:25.655]  Three weeks, they have let John Podesta go on the air and attack me by name, say that I was a Russian agent, say that I had advanced knowledge of the hacking of his email, all of which is false.
[02:34:25.775 --> 02:34:28.537]  Now, if they were really a news outlet,
[02:34:29.278 --> 02:34:33.960]  They would have given me the opportunity to go on the air and respond to that.
[02:34:34.100 --> 02:34:37.381]  That's how real journalism works.
[02:34:37.561 --> 02:34:38.821]  But it changed two years ago.
[02:34:38.841 --> 02:34:40.562]  Now it's you, myself, and others.
[02:34:40.602 --> 02:34:41.682]  Thank you so much.
[02:34:44.123 --> 02:34:45.843]  They don't even... Oh, it just popped in.
[02:34:45.883 --> 02:34:46.343]  Excuse me.
[02:34:46.684 --> 02:34:47.864]  Hillary is not going to speak?
[02:34:50.025 --> 02:34:50.465]  Well, well.
[02:34:51.533 --> 02:34:54.214]  Roger, let's war game this, because you're a mastermind at this.
[02:34:54.254 --> 02:34:55.635]  I'm going to say this, because your answer is true.
[02:34:56.236 --> 02:34:57.336]  Will they try to challenge this?
[02:34:57.356 --> 02:34:59.637]  Because they said the Russians may try to hack it.
[02:34:59.697 --> 02:35:01.158]  If Trump wins, it's the Russians.
[02:35:02.699 --> 02:35:03.820]  Let's not say we're out of the woods.
[02:35:03.860 --> 02:35:04.620]  He's about to win.
[02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:06.101]  The announcement's imminent.
[02:35:06.341 --> 02:35:09.082]  We're going to play it live here as millions watch.
[02:35:10.403 --> 02:35:12.084]  I think it would be fruitless.
[02:35:12.364 --> 02:35:15.784]  This is the biggest news story in decades.
[02:35:15.904 --> 02:35:16.605]  Oh, biggest ever.
[02:35:17.345 --> 02:35:22.986]  And one of the things that I think Trump's campaign demonstrated was he does have the bodies.
[02:35:23.126 --> 02:35:25.067]  He does have the foot soldiers.
[02:35:25.167 --> 02:35:26.307]  And he has the stamina.
[02:35:26.947 --> 02:35:28.388]  So this is over.
[02:35:28.588 --> 02:35:33.629]  She's not appearing tonight because they've probably had to medicate her.
[02:35:34.309 --> 02:35:39.134]  I mean she has to be in orbit.
[02:35:40.835 --> 02:35:43.398]  This is also unprecedented.
[02:35:43.918 --> 02:35:51.806]  This would be the first presidential candidate who hasn't come out and given a concession speech when the facts were clear.
[02:35:51.886 --> 02:35:53.708]  Do you think she's doing spirit cooking?
[02:35:54.248 --> 02:36:02.872]  I have no idea, but I do know that when I was on NPR earlier today, they asked me relentlessly, how will Trump handle this concession?
[02:36:02.912 --> 02:36:05.793]  He doesn't seem to be the kind of guy who'd be good at that.
[02:36:05.833 --> 02:36:07.934]  Do you think that he, you know, will he actually concede?
[02:36:07.974 --> 02:36:09.335]  Maybe he won't speak at all tonight.
[02:36:09.935 --> 02:36:14.518]  How ironic it turns out to be Hillary Clinton who's not speaking at all tonight.
[02:36:14.538 --> 02:36:19.963]  I love how NPR thinks because they talk in voices like this, like, I've got a little white van.
[02:36:19.983 --> 02:36:21.804]  It says ice cream.
[02:36:21.824 --> 02:36:23.145]  I have a puppy.
[02:36:23.805 --> 02:36:24.726]  There's candy.
[02:36:25.407 --> 02:36:26.267]  I'm NPR.
[02:36:26.287 --> 02:36:30.751]  If they don't get, they may have a few zombies driving Subarus.
[02:36:31.533 --> 02:36:32.114]  We're good to go.
[02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:59.315]  I'm anxious to see what's in the files in terms of all of these stories that we've read about sexual exploitation of children, Jeffrey Epstein, secret trips to Orgy Island.
[02:36:59.435 --> 02:37:02.698]  I always thought that this was an area of vulnerability for Bill Clinton.
[02:37:04.020 --> 02:37:07.124]  And that's why they invented this fake narrative.
[02:37:07.144 --> 02:37:08.466]  And that's why the gloves are off.
[02:37:08.486 --> 02:37:09.908]  I will tell you what my sources told me.
[02:37:09.988 --> 02:37:10.930]  I mean, this is all on record.
[02:37:10.950 --> 02:37:13.373]  They told me she's evil, she's into Satanism.
[02:37:13.413 --> 02:37:14.294]  I said it two months ago.
[02:37:14.655 --> 02:37:16.117]  The President of the United States attacked me.
[02:37:17.406 --> 02:37:21.268]  And now, you see, they say to the Guardian, she is the Antichrist.
[02:37:21.629 --> 02:37:25.751]  All they know is she flops around, beats her hands on the ground, and vomits.
[02:37:25.771 --> 02:37:28.053]  I mean, they're like... Her head spins like she's in the ecstasy.
[02:37:28.133 --> 02:37:28.693]  It's almost.
[02:37:28.773 --> 02:37:45.684]  I mean, it's literally, she chews carpet, she attacks Secret Service, they're like, they'll be doing nothing, and she's going... They're like, so, I told you that, now the Secret Service is on record, and if all the liberals and all the fake conservatives and the Republican Party want to defend her,
[02:37:47.156 --> 02:37:48.858]  I'm told that's what Wicked Leaks said.
[02:37:49.699 --> 02:37:51.700]  Wicked Leaks is going to release the coup de grace.
[02:37:52.061 --> 02:38:00.209]  It looks like they didn't steal the election because they knew that real men and women had stood up to them and I think that's what happened.
[02:38:00.229 --> 02:38:05.434]  I think the decision was made earlier today that they understood we're not backing down.
[02:38:07.876 --> 02:38:11.439]  That would be a shrewd judgment when it comes to Donald Trump.
[02:38:11.659 --> 02:38:12.920]  The guy is a brawler.
[02:38:13.061 --> 02:38:13.801]  He's a fighter.
[02:38:14.402 --> 02:38:24.731]  If there were any evidence whatsoever that this was hijacked, and I think there would have been if they'd been able to pull it off, he was not going to concede and just go away quietly.
[02:38:24.771 --> 02:38:26.312]  That's not his nature.
[02:38:26.833 --> 02:38:28.734]  This is the country he's fighting for.
[02:38:28.774 --> 02:38:30.296]  So all those people who said
[02:38:30.816 --> 02:38:43.001]  That he would not blindly endorse the election without knowing if it had been fairly conducted, and he was tearing at the fabric of our American society, and he was undermining the democratic process.
[02:38:43.541 --> 02:38:43.761]  No.
[02:38:44.361 --> 02:38:50.003]  If you had evidence of fraud and you didn't challenge the election, that would be un-American.
[02:38:50.143 --> 02:38:51.644]  That would be un-American.
[02:38:51.664 --> 02:38:55.285]  And didn't it seem he got stronger the more he was lied about, the more he was persecuted?
[02:38:55.305 --> 02:38:57.006]  This is so presidential.
[02:38:58.300 --> 02:38:59.760]  He's a man of enormous courage.
[02:38:59.800 --> 02:39:02.821]  Look, every time he goes out in public, he's taking his life in his hands.
[02:39:02.901 --> 02:39:03.581]  He knows that.
[02:39:04.041 --> 02:39:07.242]  He has his own first rate... Now the campaign's over.
[02:39:07.262 --> 02:39:07.782]  He's 99% won.
[02:39:08.242 --> 02:39:09.182]  You told me so privately.
[02:39:09.202 --> 02:39:10.182]  I've talked to him some too.
[02:39:10.702 --> 02:39:12.023]  You talked about he's fatalistic.
[02:39:12.303 --> 02:39:13.683]  Not in a suicidal way.
[02:39:14.083 --> 02:39:15.383]  He's just super manly.
[02:39:15.743 --> 02:39:18.264]  I mean, describe the... Let's be honest.
[02:39:18.384 --> 02:39:20.164]  He doesn't want to wear a suit of armor.
[02:39:20.244 --> 02:39:22.944]  He doesn't want to... He did things the Secret Service said no.
[02:39:23.024 --> 02:39:23.725]  He just doesn't care.
[02:39:23.745 --> 02:39:25.105]  I mean, that's manly.
[02:39:25.125 --> 02:39:25.585]  That's what I do.
[02:39:26.225 --> 02:39:28.707]  He is not a physical coward.
[02:39:29.368 --> 02:39:32.671]  I remember when he was speaking in Orlando to a large crowd.
[02:39:32.831 --> 02:39:33.732]  They rushed up.
[02:39:33.792 --> 02:39:35.373]  They wanted him to come in the back door.
[02:39:35.453 --> 02:39:36.995]  He said, I'm not coming in the back door.
[02:39:37.075 --> 02:39:38.356]  I'm coming in the front door.
[02:39:38.676 --> 02:39:39.917]  I'm walking through the hotel.
[02:39:40.017 --> 02:39:42.459]  I'm going to go into the meeting room.
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:44.661]  I'm going to walk from the back all the way to the front.
[02:39:44.741 --> 02:39:46.263]  I'm not sliding in the back door.
[02:39:46.903 --> 02:39:50.644]  No, he is a man of enormous courage.
[02:39:51.264 --> 02:39:53.144]  He understood how dangerous this is.
[02:39:53.225 --> 02:39:54.185]  He knows he has power.
[02:39:54.245 --> 02:39:57.466]  And that resonates with the police and the intelligence community.
[02:39:58.226 --> 02:40:01.026]  The cops love him because he stands up for law enforcement.
[02:40:01.266 --> 02:40:07.028]  Because he is on the side of the cops, not on the side of Black Lives Matter.
[02:40:07.128 --> 02:40:08.488]  And he's not afraid to say so.
[02:40:08.988 --> 02:40:11.649]  Hillary Clinton, despite her record of racism,
[02:40:12.649 --> 02:40:19.278]  Despite the 94 crime bill, she's now suddenly giving lip service to the Black Lives Matter movement.
[02:40:19.558 --> 02:40:20.499]  What's that all about?
[02:40:20.579 --> 02:40:21.420]  Totally source funded.
[02:40:21.901 --> 02:40:27.027]  So, I mean, I will tell you though, they admit on Fox, even CNN admits Trump is the projected winner.
[02:40:27.688 --> 02:40:32.152]  What in the hell is going on with Donald Trump not nine-tenths the law's possession?
[02:40:32.752 --> 02:40:34.154]  Why is he not?
[02:40:34.194 --> 02:40:35.295]  You talked to him an hour and a half ago.
[02:40:35.315 --> 02:40:36.295]  We talked to him an hour and a half ago.
[02:40:36.316 --> 02:40:39.458]  They were going to go over from Trump Tower to this other place, give a speech.
[02:40:39.839 --> 02:40:40.959]  Right Side News was told to.
[02:40:41.020 --> 02:40:41.520]  They're there.
[02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:43.001]  We have a subscription to their feed.
[02:40:43.021 --> 02:40:44.042]  It's on m4wars.com.
[02:40:45.203 --> 02:40:48.385]  I mean, I want to sit here and put a bow on this.
[02:40:48.465 --> 02:40:55.868]  I want to go home and just sleep like, you know... Traditionally, the winner waits for the loser to concede.
[02:40:55.948 --> 02:40:57.729]  But Hillary, they admit, is not conceding.
[02:40:57.929 --> 02:41:01.411]  And therefore, maybe this is the triggering event that brings Trump to the podium.
[02:41:01.451 --> 02:41:08.534]  Perhaps he was, as is traditional, waiting for... Is Hillary trying to get them to launch a nuke at Russia?
[02:41:09.115 --> 02:41:10.335]  Who knows what she's doing.
[02:41:10.355 --> 02:41:11.516]  These criminals will do anything.
[02:41:11.836 --> 02:41:13.797]  I suspect she's sedated at this point.
[02:41:14.713 --> 02:41:18.355]  If not, she's throwing so much stuff at Bill, the guy's probably scarred.
[02:41:18.776 --> 02:41:20.177]  Yeah, he like fell down last night.
[02:41:20.217 --> 02:41:22.178]  He was getting in the car, she's like falling down.
[02:41:22.398 --> 02:41:25.620]  I feel sorry she has, reportedly, this brain tumor that grew back.
[02:41:26.060 --> 02:41:27.001]  She's gonna be dead soon.
[02:41:29.181 --> 02:41:30.002]  I don't know about that.
[02:41:30.622 --> 02:41:34.004]  Why would she be part of this?
[02:41:34.985 --> 02:41:40.189]  Because their lust for power, and particularly for wealth, is so overwhelming.
[02:41:40.249 --> 02:41:42.390]  Look, they have dodged so many bullets.
[02:41:42.791 --> 02:41:44.092]  They should both be in prison.
[02:41:44.752 --> 02:41:47.474]  I agree, but the more bullets I dodge, the more I get nervous.
[02:41:47.874 --> 02:41:49.936]  They have that false chutzpah.
[02:41:50.536 --> 02:41:52.538]  The more bullets they dodge, they're invincible.
[02:41:52.598 --> 02:41:55.540]  No, it's an addiction to power and money.
[02:41:55.740 --> 02:41:58.923]  They should ride off into the sunset with their stolen hundreds of millions.
[02:41:59.404 --> 02:42:00.404]  They have dodged what?
[02:42:00.524 --> 02:42:05.509]  Travelgate, Whitewater, Benghazi, email, Mark Rich.
[02:42:06.489 --> 02:42:15.960]  Sandy Berger, I mean the list of scandals for which they should have gone to prison goes on and on and on, but they still have to come back to steal more.
[02:42:16.621 --> 02:42:22.908]  They have to come back, this is greed I think is the overwhelming... I was about to say, I would see if they came back for ideology because I would.
[02:42:23.865 --> 02:42:25.906]  I mean, furniture is stuff you can't stand, you want to get rid of.
[02:42:25.926 --> 02:42:32.871]  The stealing at the State Department and the White House, and they report, oh, foreign com- Hillary's coming to the French Embassy.
[02:42:33.071 --> 02:42:34.031]  Lock down the vases.
[02:42:34.372 --> 02:42:35.873]  They have to hide stuff when she comes.
[02:42:36.949 --> 02:42:38.250]  So, again, you said it.
[02:42:38.330 --> 02:42:39.431]  It's so big steel.
[02:42:39.451 --> 02:42:40.091]  It's mine!
[02:42:40.211 --> 02:42:41.552]  Oh, what's in here?
[02:42:41.672 --> 02:42:42.573]  I want your handkerchief!
[02:42:43.113 --> 02:42:43.694]  Oh, it's mine!
[02:42:44.494 --> 02:42:45.014]  It's greed.
[02:42:45.235 --> 02:42:49.978]  No, I think greed is the overwhelming factor here.
[02:42:50.558 --> 02:42:56.762]  But in what world do you want what someone else has got unless it's a gorgeous broad?
[02:42:58.223 --> 02:43:00.285]  But they want it because they can have it.
[02:43:01.192 --> 02:43:04.414]  The Democratic establishment rolled over for her.
[02:43:04.874 --> 02:43:10.357]  She still had to cheat to beat this 80-year-old, not even a Democrat, socialist senator.
[02:43:11.057 --> 02:43:13.798]  In my view of him, it kind of went full cycle.
[02:43:13.999 --> 02:43:16.720]  I started out kind of thinking it was a joke.
[02:43:17.898 --> 02:43:21.460]  When I saw the guy fighting in the primaries and working like a dog.
[02:43:21.480 --> 02:43:22.921]  Let me interrupt you.
[02:43:22.941 --> 02:43:26.684]  I started to think that he was actually, you know, he was a man of principle.
[02:43:26.724 --> 02:43:28.025]  At least not my principles.
[02:43:28.065 --> 02:43:30.146]  Let me interrupt you, but CNN's reporting, continue.
[02:43:30.667 --> 02:43:31.787]  Clinton will not speak tonight.
[02:43:31.807 --> 02:43:35.750]  This is officially from a Democratic operative Axelrod on the Clinton News Network.
[02:43:35.790 --> 02:43:39.152]  So, the Clinton News Network has said they will not concede.
[02:43:39.492 --> 02:43:46.857]  Trump must now immediately come out and say he is the winner or she will have Obama launch a nuclear war tomorrow.
[02:43:46.917 --> 02:43:47.318]  And by the way,
[02:43:48.158 --> 02:43:48.939]  I've got a bad feeling.
[02:43:49.119 --> 02:43:51.080]  I'm not saying that for effect.
[02:43:51.560 --> 02:43:53.402]  People know, I don't play games, okay?
[02:43:54.442 --> 02:43:56.224]  There's one thing, I don't play games.
[02:43:56.804 --> 02:43:58.245]  People better get that through their heads.
[02:43:59.005 --> 02:43:59.726]  And I'm telling you.
[02:44:00.953 --> 02:44:03.495]  Everybody's celebrating, and I'm celebrating, too.
[02:44:03.655 --> 02:44:05.617]  I have a very bad feeling.
[02:44:06.197 --> 02:44:12.323]  I'm going to continue to say that, and maybe it's because bad stuff's going on, maybe we're going to get through this, but I'm about to throw up, Roger.
[02:44:12.863 --> 02:44:14.705]  Trump has arrived at his headquarters.
[02:44:14.725 --> 02:44:15.245]  Oh, there he is.
[02:44:15.505 --> 02:44:15.966]  Oh, yes.
[02:44:16.326 --> 02:44:17.747]  So, this is about to happen.
[02:44:18.588 --> 02:44:20.009]  But, I mean, you agree with me today.
[02:44:20.029 --> 02:44:20.810]  They're going to try to steal it.
[02:44:20.850 --> 02:44:21.570]  You have this feeling.
[02:44:21.951 --> 02:44:24.393]  So, is it just that it's so epic we're having this anxiety?
[02:44:24.433 --> 02:44:25.874]  I mean, my gut's never wrong.
[02:44:25.974 --> 02:44:26.675]  What is it?
[02:44:26.995 --> 02:44:27.415]  Tell me now.
[02:44:27.535 --> 02:44:28.016]  I need to know.
[02:44:30.452 --> 02:44:33.494]  I think the establishment's between a rock and a hard place.
[02:44:33.514 --> 02:44:36.255]  They're picking up the anxiety of them shitting themselves.
[02:44:36.955 --> 02:44:38.236]  I suspect that that's right.
[02:44:38.316 --> 02:44:40.337]  They have to be in shock.
[02:44:41.337 --> 02:44:46.339]  I don't even know that they have a plan B. They want to keep their foot on us and not make us wealthy.
[02:44:46.960 --> 02:44:48.920]  They love doubling black unemployment.
[02:44:50.001 --> 02:44:51.201]  It certainly doesn't bother them.
[02:44:51.602 --> 02:44:52.562]  They have fostered it.
[02:44:53.222 --> 02:44:58.985]  Nobody has suffered more from the economic policies of the Clintons and Obama than black people.
[02:44:59.935 --> 02:45:02.979]  So, we're in a watershed moment here.
[02:45:03.960 --> 02:45:05.302]  I think they're out of tricks.
[02:45:05.923 --> 02:45:07.485]  The American people have revolted.
[02:45:07.505 --> 02:45:08.887]  This is an insurrection.
[02:45:09.748 --> 02:45:13.053]  This is an uprising, and it's not going to be short-circuited.
[02:45:15.279 --> 02:45:27.061]  And he's going to give political cover to the general public and a bunch of billionaires, some of which I know that are free market, who want to save the country and make us wealthy and successful.
[02:45:27.621 --> 02:45:30.462]  He is the vanguard to that.
[02:45:31.162 --> 02:45:35.583]  And the fact that he has now won is going to trigger a whole new renaissance.
[02:45:36.183 --> 02:45:40.644]  But let's not underestimate the power of the enemy.
[02:45:41.477 --> 02:45:46.298]  Roger Stone, watching your six, they hate you, they hate me, they hate Trump.
[02:45:47.599 --> 02:45:49.259]  We've got to take care of ourselves.
[02:45:49.659 --> 02:45:51.559]  We've won the battle so far.
[02:45:51.639 --> 02:45:52.360]  Our listeners have.
[02:45:52.760 --> 02:45:55.500]  Trump's about to make his victory speech.
[02:45:55.540 --> 02:45:56.401]  This is epic.
[02:45:57.041 --> 02:46:03.562]  On now November 9th, we're now into the night in the East Coast, the Central Coast, and Mountain, not Pacific yet.
[02:46:04.723 --> 02:46:07.303]  In your gut, right now, what do we have to watch out for?
[02:46:07.343 --> 02:46:10.164]  Because, hey, we've had the victory, but here come the enemy.
[02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:21.085]  I've written a book on the Kennedy assassination, and in that book I make the very clear case that the Secret Service undermined and made possible the murder of John F. Kennedy.
[02:46:21.606 --> 02:46:26.488]  So, my prayers are for the President-elect's safety.
[02:46:26.749 --> 02:46:28.389]  That's my greatest concern.
[02:46:28.409 --> 02:46:30.931]  And the good news is, the Secret Service likes him.
[02:46:31.618 --> 02:46:41.981]  Well, but he has his own private security on top of it, and I don't think he'll ever drop that, because he's had a team of professionals who know him and know their business, and we're not supposed to talk about that, so I won't.
[02:46:42.121 --> 02:46:42.301]  U.S.
[02:46:42.341 --> 02:46:42.721]  military.
[02:46:42.822 --> 02:46:53.465]  But he will, he's not going to cower, he's not going to hide, he hated wearing a bulletproof vest, he hated it because it's heavy and it's hot, and it weighs you down.
[02:46:54.085 --> 02:46:55.246]  And it does that as well?
[02:46:55.826 --> 02:47:00.028]  So that's where my prayers are directed at this point.
[02:47:00.108 --> 02:47:05.130]  Because I think that's the only way to short-circuit the New American Revolution.
[02:47:05.150 --> 02:47:11.613]  And separate from you, I know because we had a security assessment to talk to some other folks, I know what security group he's got.
[02:47:12.374 --> 02:47:13.234]  And that's a good deal.
[02:47:13.554 --> 02:47:14.235]  That's a good deal.
[02:47:14.975 --> 02:47:19.459]  Because the Secret Service is great, but, you know, diplomatic detail type protection.
[02:47:20.300 --> 02:47:26.266]  I am convinced that the Secret Service stood down on November 22, 1963.
[02:47:27.027 --> 02:47:31.671]  I think they also stood down when there was an attempt on Reagan's life.
[02:47:32.011 --> 02:47:35.835]  Well, we have the footage of those guys bitching, like, I'm not supposed to go with the car, you know, in Dallas.
[02:47:36.115 --> 02:47:41.540]  Right, so this is a concern of mine, now when you say things like that, you know what they say?
[02:47:42.241 --> 02:47:44.183]  You're a conspiracy theorist!
[02:47:44.543 --> 02:47:45.804]  David Brock, are you listening?
[02:47:46.004 --> 02:47:51.850]  Oh, but we're the ones who just elected the President, we're the ones with the 27 million people that tuned in today.
[02:47:51.870 --> 02:47:53.191]  You understand that?
[02:47:53.992 --> 02:47:55.113]  Who bought them TVs, bitch?
[02:47:55.173 --> 02:47:57.595]  Tell me that!
[02:47:58.216 --> 02:47:59.437]  It's an extraordinary night.
[02:47:59.837 --> 02:48:00.418]  I think that
[02:48:01.704 --> 02:48:03.425]  I think the establishment's out of tricks here.
[02:48:03.485 --> 02:48:06.386]  This is their worst nightmare come to fruition.
[02:48:07.186 --> 02:48:11.207]  Is it a little... we said this earlier when there weren't cameras on, we didn't have Netflix here and all this.
[02:48:12.008 --> 02:48:16.049]  Isn't this surreal though because we're not looking for power.
[02:48:16.829 --> 02:48:17.910]  We're not trying to take over.
[02:48:18.690 --> 02:48:24.832]  But we do know our enemies are these little spiritually hunchbacked weird little twisted demon creatures like Podesta and Hillary.
[02:48:25.553 --> 02:48:29.114]  And so it really is just the course of nature that they're being defeated because
[02:48:30.478 --> 02:48:34.301]  As Bismarck said, God loves drunks, children, and the United States of America.
[02:48:34.841 --> 02:48:36.582]  And you just mess with Providence.
[02:48:38.363 --> 02:48:42.006]  I think Trump was sent here for a reason, at a time.
[02:48:42.026 --> 02:48:47.289]  And I think he has a special protection, as it will.
[02:48:47.830 --> 02:48:50.111]  He never, ever lost heart.
[02:48:50.211 --> 02:48:53.033]  He never lost faith in his ability to do this.
[02:48:53.454 --> 02:48:55.555]  While people around him were scratching their heads.
[02:48:55.815 --> 02:48:56.716]  He never faltered.
[02:48:56.736 --> 02:48:57.957]  And sending out their resumes.
[02:48:57.977 --> 02:48:58.777]  He never wavered.
[02:48:58.857 --> 02:48:59.558]  No, he never did.
[02:49:00.670 --> 02:49:10.139]  And as recently as yesterday, when everybody and his brother in the great pontificating class was saying, she's gonna get 340, 345 electoral votes, it's gonna be a blowout.
[02:49:14.465 --> 02:49:19.286]  He was never depressed, he was never angry, and he never doubted that he could win.
[02:49:19.526 --> 02:49:28.769]  And inside baseball, you talking to him and others, and I've talked to him some, he went from a few months ago being a little bit down to, like, he's just this machine.
[02:49:29.169 --> 02:49:30.690]  Seven, eight, nine speeches a day.
[02:49:30.710 --> 02:49:33.130]  No one's ever seen anything.
[02:49:33.150 --> 02:49:36.611]  He'd go from east to west coast, everyone's just like, what the hell's going on?
[02:49:36.951 --> 02:49:42.233]  He'd be on 100 degree tarmac constantly, and the New York Times would say, we were allowed to be on board.
[02:49:42.873 --> 02:49:47.334]  He was talking to his son-in-law about, do you think my tax cut will really help the poor?
[02:49:48.235 --> 02:49:51.116]  Because I, and then he's like, he didn't know we were listening.
[02:49:51.456 --> 02:49:55.157]  It's pathetic that he was obsessing over the poor people.
[02:49:55.597 --> 02:50:05.380]  The New York Times was so demonic in that article about his last stand about he was talking about the poor people and how he was gonna, I mean, who the hell are these people?
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:07.961]  It's interesting that
[02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:12.342]  I don't think he was ever down or depressed.
[02:50:12.762 --> 02:50:14.043]  I think he was angry.
[02:50:15.504 --> 02:50:19.586]  Angry because of the constant mainstream media attacks on him.
[02:50:20.307 --> 02:50:20.927]  Just sick of it.
[02:50:20.947 --> 02:50:22.528]  But the third debate, he transcended it.
[02:50:23.048 --> 02:50:25.930]  Well, I'll tell you what really aggravated him, and you can't blame him.
[02:50:26.550 --> 02:50:34.295]  The women who came forward and claimed that he groped them, who couldn't remember the day, the year, the time, the place.
[02:50:34.955 --> 02:50:42.899]  It was all phony and we now know that David Brock and the Clintonites were out advertising in Craigslist as early as May.
[02:50:42.919 --> 02:50:47.741]  Let's be honest, there were women around the block begging for Donald Trump to date them.
[02:50:48.621 --> 02:50:49.242]  He was single.
[02:50:49.782 --> 02:50:50.862]  He was a ladies man.
[02:50:50.942 --> 02:50:52.023]  He was a billionaire.
[02:50:52.803 --> 02:50:54.944]  You know any women who might be interested in that package?
[02:50:55.425 --> 02:51:08.652]  So, this was a lie from the beginning and they knew that Bill had his own vulnerabilities in this area and they knew that Hillary was particularly vulnerable because she covered it up.
[02:51:08.672 --> 02:51:12.754]  And now they've dropped four lawsuits when Trump said, my lawyer's ready to meet you.
[02:51:12.914 --> 02:51:13.155]  Yes.
[02:51:13.195 --> 02:51:14.095]  And they all drop them.
[02:51:14.375 --> 02:51:14.615]  Yes.
[02:51:14.715 --> 02:51:15.456]  Because it's made up.
[02:51:15.856 --> 02:51:22.192]  Yeah, a number of these women actually contacted Trump after this allegedly happened.
[02:51:23.160 --> 02:51:24.801]  In a favorable communication.
[02:51:24.901 --> 02:51:30.546]  Well, 6 of the 9, the first flotilla didn't say he raped him, just that he was like, please come to my thing.
[02:51:30.566 --> 02:51:31.386]  I've got a great business.
[02:51:31.666 --> 02:51:32.807]  Thanks for what you did on The Apprentice.
[02:51:32.887 --> 02:51:33.428]  Oh, I love you.
[02:51:33.788 --> 02:51:34.649]  Oh, baby, please.
[02:51:35.029 --> 02:51:36.270]  And then he's like, sorry, can't come.
[02:51:36.410 --> 02:51:38.131]  Oh, my God, you raped me in the ass, you know?
[02:51:38.471 --> 02:51:42.534]  I mean, it is, it is, it is so insane to watch this.
[02:51:42.554 --> 02:51:43.895]  So let me ask you this, Roger Stone.
[02:51:44.296 --> 02:51:45.356]  Anytime now, punch it up.
[02:51:45.436 --> 02:51:46.938]  Right side news, Infowars.com.
[02:51:47.838 --> 02:51:48.759]  The big Trump victory.
[02:51:48.799 --> 02:51:50.160]  We can put a fork in this and be done.
[02:51:50.660 --> 02:51:51.201]  Anytime now.
[02:51:53.188 --> 02:51:54.289]  Let's keep going back to this.
[02:51:54.669 --> 02:51:55.770]  How are they going to strike back?
[02:51:56.250 --> 02:51:57.071]  What are they going to do?
[02:51:57.431 --> 02:52:00.733]  The media... I mean, it isn't us saying this.
[02:52:01.394 --> 02:52:08.699]  It was in the major corporate sites that track how much money you make and what you do.
[02:52:09.219 --> 02:52:10.580]  There are all these different sites out there.
[02:52:11.161 --> 02:52:14.023]  They've got Reuters, Thomson Reuters.
[02:52:14.843 --> 02:52:15.964]  They've got a bunch of other sites.
[02:52:16.705 --> 02:52:18.106]  But this was actually in Bloomberg.
[02:52:18.466 --> 02:52:19.447]  Drudge read it like a week ago.
[02:52:23.731 --> 02:52:29.158]  7.5% drop in earnings in the last quarter, third quarter, for newspapers.
[02:52:29.979 --> 02:52:35.626]  And then there was another article where advertising for broadcast TV but also network TV was down over half.
[02:52:35.946 --> 02:52:40.051]  Now, that's half of already being weighed down to almost basically toilet level.
[02:52:40.868 --> 02:52:45.690]  Now let's be clear, we can't even swap off the advertisers with a frickin' bat.
[02:52:46.110 --> 02:52:48.291]  But I gotta verify and make sure they're good so I don't take a lot of them.
[02:52:49.052 --> 02:52:50.232]  They are in free fall.
[02:52:50.412 --> 02:52:52.613]  It's just, they're done, they're done.
[02:52:53.074 --> 02:52:55.035]  We're exploding, they're imploding.
[02:52:55.995 --> 02:52:59.397]  It's all over the news that they're in cardiac arrest.
[02:53:00.257 --> 02:53:06.580]  Not just 6% approval rating in AP studies, they are literally so reviled
[02:53:07.602 --> 02:53:11.325]  They're like Hitler in 1945 in Berlin.
[02:53:11.745 --> 02:53:15.629]  They are beyond asswipe.
[02:53:16.229 --> 02:53:18.391]  So, I don't do this as a pissing contest.
[02:53:18.451 --> 02:53:19.652]  I don't want to dominate these people.
[02:53:19.912 --> 02:53:20.493]  They're jokes.
[02:53:21.113 --> 02:53:26.998]  They are so low, though, we must degrade them and have some big victory lap.
[02:53:27.879 --> 02:53:33.264]  Because no one is going to admit that you get millions of views a day, we do.
[02:53:33.624 --> 02:53:36.426]  We have 28 million, 27 million people that have tuned in.
[02:53:36.446 --> 02:53:37.947]  26 when I checked a few hours ago.
[02:53:38.568 --> 02:53:40.650]  Just to our streams, not our commercial stations.
[02:53:41.270 --> 02:53:43.892]  It's, we're dominating them so bad, it's obnoxious.
[02:53:43.912 --> 02:53:48.897]  Them in suits going, we're CNN, we're MSNBC, we're the big people, blah blah blah.
[02:53:49.077 --> 02:53:53.761]  When they've got a million viewers, if they're lucky, these people are done.
[02:53:54.401 --> 02:54:00.526]  And Trump is a manifestation of that, and it's so epic, Roger Stone, that I don't even have words to describe it.
[02:54:00.546 --> 02:54:01.487]  I feel like I'm in the Matrix.
[02:54:01.947 --> 02:54:09.113]  I never knew that I'd be here with you, you know, a famous politico, who's for patriotism, kicking the slimebag's ass.
[02:54:09.193 --> 02:54:10.935]  It's like I wanted to be part of it.
[02:54:11.455 --> 02:54:14.698]  I didn't want to be the battery ram blowing their doors down.
[02:54:14.718 --> 02:54:15.919]  So that's my rant.
[02:54:15.959 --> 02:54:17.340]  But it isn't hype.
[02:54:17.420 --> 02:54:19.222]  They are just that pathetic.
[02:54:20.202 --> 02:54:22.705]  My greatest concern, of course, would be some effort to
[02:54:23.425 --> 02:54:26.088]  Collapse the economy and then blame it on Trump.
[02:54:26.188 --> 02:54:27.209]  So they're doing that with Brexit.
[02:54:27.229 --> 02:54:27.890]  Let's talk about that.
[02:54:28.070 --> 02:54:31.554]  Yeah, you have some example of this in the in the UK.
[02:54:32.475 --> 02:54:42.826]  The central bankers, those who have profited mightily from the whole George Soros assholes, people like that, will now try to collapse the economy in a way to blame Trump.
[02:54:43.807 --> 02:54:50.191]  That, to me, is probably a greater concern than my concern about assassination.
[02:54:50.211 --> 02:54:56.315]  And I'm not a violent guy, but at a certain point, don't people start getting helicopter rides once they try to crush the economy?
[02:54:57.396 --> 02:54:58.017]  We shall see.
[02:54:58.037 --> 02:55:00.558]  I'll continue, I'm ranting, you take over.
[02:55:00.618 --> 02:55:03.800]  I don't even know, I'm not even sure, look, I don't even know how you would do that.
[02:55:04.001 --> 02:55:07.583]  I don't have the financial sophistication to know how you would do it.
[02:55:07.643 --> 02:55:10.485]  I know that there are people who know how to do it.
[02:55:11.636 --> 02:55:12.977]  Trump's a Wharton graduate.
[02:55:13.417 --> 02:55:15.519]  Trump is a brilliant financier.
[02:55:15.599 --> 02:55:20.122]  He understands this world in a way that... And if he blames them for it, they won't do it.
[02:55:20.162 --> 02:55:20.943]  That's why they're so scared.
[02:55:21.123 --> 02:55:22.784]  Well, because, see, I think he can understand it.
[02:55:22.804 --> 02:55:24.245]  You're not dealing with a politician.
[02:55:24.686 --> 02:55:31.150]  You're dealing with a self-made billionaire who understands high finance because that's his specialty.
[02:55:31.551 --> 02:55:32.532]  That's what he studied.
[02:55:33.012 --> 02:55:39.477]  So I think they're going to have a hard time with a president who understands the economy better than the bankers do.
[02:55:40.653 --> 02:55:42.334]  So that goes to my next question.
[02:55:43.874 --> 02:55:45.134]  Why are they so scared of him?
[02:55:45.154 --> 02:55:49.556]  I mean, they are... I'm not saying this to aggrandize ourselves.
[02:55:49.996 --> 02:55:56.197]  If you look at most of the articles from the White House around media matters, but also CNN, it's Donald Trump, it's Roger Stone, it's Alex Jones.
[02:55:56.637 --> 02:55:58.278]  Then there's Stephen Bannon and Drudge.
[02:55:58.738 --> 02:56:00.198]  But it's like five or six of us.
[02:56:00.218 --> 02:56:00.479]  Go ahead.
[02:56:00.499 --> 02:56:01.919]  You guys are popping in my ear?
[02:56:05.058 --> 02:56:05.859]  You guys open the mic up.
[02:56:06.239 --> 02:56:07.480]  Why are they so scared of us?
[02:56:07.541 --> 02:56:09.142]  Let's go back to the right side broadcasting.
[02:56:09.803 --> 02:56:12.145]  Donald Trump, the winner in Wisconsin.
[02:56:12.825 --> 02:56:13.426]  So there you go.
[02:56:13.466 --> 02:56:14.267]  Trump's about to come out.
[02:56:14.807 --> 02:56:15.668]  Please continue, Roger Stone.
[02:56:15.908 --> 02:56:22.254]  We are living history right now at 1.29 and 22 seconds worldwide.
[02:56:22.855 --> 02:56:24.637]  Alex Jones at the Infowars News Center.
[02:56:25.237 --> 02:56:31.042]  All I want is lower taxes, prosperity, freedom, free speech, classical liberalism.
[02:56:31.522 --> 02:56:34.525]  I've been called every name in the book for promoting America.
[02:56:35.085 --> 02:56:46.555]  And now we are on the threshold of the greatest upset, the greatest overthrow of the mainstream media and corporate system that the United States has ever seen on scale and magnitude.
[02:56:46.595 --> 02:56:47.296]  This is greater.
[02:56:47.816 --> 02:56:49.197]  The election in Concord in 1775.
[02:56:49.757 --> 02:56:54.339]  This is an information war being won before our very eyes.
[02:56:54.860 --> 02:56:56.400]  Stone, check the phone if you want, go ahead.
[02:56:56.861 --> 02:56:57.981]  Tell us what you think's happening.
[02:56:59.042 --> 02:57:09.787]  I'm waiting for the next President of the United States to come out and I'm trying to figure out why that has not... Now I'm getting advice from my wife saying, why hasn't he called it?
[02:57:10.888 --> 02:57:12.348]  Good honey, I don't get it.
[02:57:12.528 --> 02:57:17.431]  We need to find out who's holding him up and that person needs to be blown out a goddamn airlock.
[02:57:18.581 --> 02:57:34.652]  I mean, I'm not being an asshole here, but I am so sick of people that haven't built a media information, they don't know how to win, and Trump, his instincts are always right, and he has these people that are always in the chicken shit land, and I know stations are caring, and just to lay that out, I just, at this point, give me a break.
[02:57:35.693 --> 02:57:38.014]  Presidential election live, Donald Trump nears victory.
[02:57:38.074 --> 02:57:39.255]  No, he's had victory.
[02:57:39.835 --> 02:57:42.917]  New York Times, but Hillary Clinton refuses to concede.
[02:57:43.158 --> 02:57:44.238]  So let's talk about that.
[02:57:46.581 --> 02:57:49.464]  Possession, as you said two hours ago, is nine-tenths of the law.
[02:57:49.864 --> 02:57:51.325]  Announce the victory.
[02:57:51.826 --> 02:57:52.266]  Take it.
[02:57:52.526 --> 02:57:53.247]  You have won.
[02:57:53.747 --> 02:57:54.668]  Take it in your hand.
[02:57:54.728 --> 02:57:55.349]  You have done it.
[02:57:55.749 --> 02:57:56.670]  We are here now.
[02:57:59.312 --> 02:57:59.753]  Amazing.
[02:58:00.193 --> 02:58:01.094]  Just amazing.
[02:58:01.134 --> 02:58:03.016]  And I guess I can call one of his kids up on the phone.
[02:58:03.036 --> 02:58:07.840]  Not only does he have a phone, I mean, just declare... Talk about a cliffhanger.
[02:58:09.059 --> 02:58:10.521]  Is this saying I'll keep you in suspense?
[02:58:11.202 --> 02:58:20.355]  Well, by saying that she refuses to concede, very clearly they are trying to determine whether there is a strategy to challenge this.
[02:58:21.358 --> 02:58:21.758]  That's it.
[02:58:21.818 --> 02:58:23.319]  Hillary plans to challenge race.
[02:58:23.379 --> 02:58:27.021]  Trump must declare victory and have the coup de grace.
[02:58:27.081 --> 02:58:28.222]  That would be my advice.
[02:58:28.642 --> 02:58:32.585]  I was there, of course, for the Gore-Bush recount.
[02:58:33.325 --> 02:58:37.467]  Declaring victory, seizing it, when Bush did was... Coup de grace.
[02:58:37.507 --> 02:58:38.188]  This is clear.
[02:58:38.228 --> 02:58:38.748]  That was it.
[02:58:38.988 --> 02:58:39.729]  You admitted that.
[02:58:39.969 --> 02:58:40.749]  Coup de grace.
[02:58:40.989 --> 02:58:41.650]  Coup de grace.
[02:58:41.890 --> 02:58:42.730]  Coup de liberté.
[02:58:43.011 --> 02:58:44.932]  I mean, what do you think is going on?
[02:58:45.152 --> 02:58:46.192]  I got Bannon's cell phone.
[02:58:46.212 --> 02:58:47.313]  I mean, you got it too.
[02:58:47.353 --> 02:58:47.773]  I can call...
[02:58:49.403 --> 02:58:50.745]  I'm not trying to act like a big shot here.
[02:58:50.825 --> 02:58:51.766]  What the hell, man?
[02:58:52.247 --> 02:58:53.489]  We have delivered it.
[02:58:53.509 --> 02:58:55.111]  The people have delivered the victory.
[02:58:56.133 --> 02:58:57.875]  And I'm about to absolutely go ape.
[02:58:58.015 --> 02:58:58.476]  You know what?
[02:58:58.616 --> 02:58:59.337]  You keep talking.
[02:58:59.417 --> 02:59:00.319]  I'm going to go make a phone call.
[02:59:00.359 --> 02:59:00.960]  Yeah, make a phone call.
[02:59:04.414 --> 02:59:09.677]  Yeah, Google just, he just won Wisconsin, he won Pennsylvania, geez, oh God, this is incredible.
[02:59:09.697 --> 02:59:20.124]  This is a landslide, and that witch, that hunchback demon that stumbles around and falls all over the place, and Trump is not doing it.
[02:59:20.764 --> 02:59:30.491]  I just want to know who in hell is telling him not to declare victory, because I don't want to see defeat grabbed from the jaws of victory.
[02:59:32.052 --> 02:59:33.853]  I want to see victory grabbed from the jaws of defeat.
[02:59:36.141 --> 02:59:37.562]  What's the name of the video we're shooting right now?
[02:59:41.384 --> 02:59:42.485]  No, Trump has one.
[02:59:42.505 --> 02:59:43.606]  How many viewers have we got on that?
[02:59:43.626 --> 02:59:44.246]  A couple hundred thousand?
[02:59:44.266 --> 02:59:49.209]  It'll be a few hundred thousand.
[02:59:49.249 --> 02:59:50.810]  Donald Trump won the presidency.
[02:59:51.211 --> 02:59:52.772]  The New York Times has announced it.
[02:59:52.852 --> 02:59:54.833]  They are God because Carlos Slim owns it.
[02:59:55.794 --> 02:59:57.375]  Carlos Slim is God.
[02:59:58.770 --> 03:00:01.993]  And the New York Times has now announced Donald Trump has won the presidency.
[03:00:02.373 --> 03:00:05.776]  So, who cares if Hillary says he didn't?
[03:00:06.577 --> 03:00:09.139]  Hillary is a degenerate, murderous criminal.
[03:00:11.201 --> 03:00:12.182]  That's Google on screen.
[03:00:18.728 --> 03:00:20.469]  Podesta isn't conceding.
[03:00:22.291 --> 03:00:22.551]  Get this.
[03:00:30.154 --> 03:00:32.735]  This will be a day long remembered.
[03:00:32.935 --> 03:00:34.035]  We've seen the end.
[03:00:34.055 --> 03:00:39.037]  Hillary Clinton will soon see the end of George Soros.
[03:00:41.338 --> 03:00:43.999]  I've never seen such, such, such behavior.
[03:00:44.019 --> 03:00:53.062]  I mean, he's dominated, he's won the election, and he's gonna allow that Sal, that murderous war criminal, to now dispute it.
[03:00:54.083 --> 03:00:54.403]  Roger!
[03:00:55.484 --> 03:01:00.887]  Is she, is he going to let her dispute this because she's now announcing Hillary to dispute the election.
[03:01:01.127 --> 03:01:02.768]  They're going to announce the Russians did it.
[03:01:05.589 --> 03:01:11.072]  No, it's not going to sell, I get it, but they'll launch a war about Amara and these people.
[03:01:13.857 --> 03:01:14.437]  Trump won.
[03:01:15.017 --> 03:01:18.918]  Who's telling him, don't go declare the victory and you're going to lose?
[03:01:19.058 --> 03:01:20.339]  He had the victory.
[03:01:21.059 --> 03:01:25.600]  Even the Washington Post and Google admit he has won.
[03:01:26.621 --> 03:01:27.681]  But we can't do it.
[03:01:27.781 --> 03:01:28.061]  I know.
[03:01:28.101 --> 03:01:28.521]  We can't.
[03:01:29.341 --> 03:01:29.721]  I know.
[03:01:29.921 --> 03:01:30.802]  We have to have Hillary.
[03:01:30.842 --> 03:01:32.262]  We have to have prisons.
[03:01:32.682 --> 03:01:34.863]  We have to have narcotics trafficking by the government.
[03:01:34.903 --> 03:01:36.083]  We have to have open borders.
[03:01:36.123 --> 03:01:38.564]  We have to have a weird witch lady with a big clown head.
[03:01:39.204 --> 03:01:42.285]  She has to increase taxes on poor people and screw everyone.
[03:01:43.353 --> 03:01:44.173]  Yeah, let's show Drudge.
[03:01:44.193 --> 03:01:44.853]  Let's scroll that up.
[03:01:44.933 --> 03:01:46.034]  Not ready to let go.
[03:01:46.554 --> 03:01:48.174]  Trump wins a historic uprising.
[03:01:48.214 --> 03:01:49.475]  Yeah, it's true.
[03:01:49.995 --> 03:01:50.495]  Doesn't matter.
[03:01:50.515 --> 03:01:51.956]  He won't declare the victory, so whatever.
[03:01:52.216 --> 03:01:53.216]  I'll declare the damn victory.
[03:01:53.876 --> 03:01:54.976]  Republicans keep howls.
[03:01:55.056 --> 03:01:55.977]  Republicans keep shouting.
[03:01:56.617 --> 03:01:57.237]  Well, of course they do.
[03:01:57.277 --> 03:01:58.017]  It's not that they're good.
[03:01:58.037 --> 03:02:00.258]  They're the traitors, the Democrats, the open aggressors.
[03:02:00.638 --> 03:02:06.860]  We have to kick the rhinos and neocons out and restore the republic that is the apple of the world's eye here.
[03:02:08.427 --> 03:02:09.369]  I mean, I'm live.
[03:02:09.509 --> 03:02:11.172]  I've been up since 4 AM.
[03:02:11.713 --> 03:02:12.454]  I'm not bitching.
[03:02:12.574 --> 03:02:19.546]  It's just... Stone.
[03:02:19.907 --> 03:02:20.268]  I know you are.
[03:02:20.288 --> 03:02:20.929]  Have you called Bannon?
[03:02:23.502 --> 03:02:23.983]  I'd call him.
[03:02:24.203 --> 03:02:26.425]  I mean, I know Bannon wouldn't tell him this.
[03:02:26.505 --> 03:02:31.009]  I mean, this is declare victory before she launches a nuclear war.
[03:02:31.830 --> 03:02:34.892]  Good God, this woman out of her loins wants to give us death.
[03:02:35.333 --> 03:02:36.494]  Bring us victory.
[03:02:37.134 --> 03:02:38.155]  Bring us victory.
[03:02:38.696 --> 03:02:39.496]  Bring us victory.
[03:02:39.516 --> 03:02:42.519]  You know, Google pays zero tax, can't we just pay a 20% tax?
[03:02:43.060 --> 03:02:44.461]  Can't we just be as good as that?
[03:02:46.628 --> 03:02:49.769]  Let's play the world saying no to Hillary, the nuclear war video.
[03:02:50.669 --> 03:02:52.610]  And I'm going to take a brief break here.
[03:02:52.730 --> 03:03:00.112]  It's 1.35, 1.36, Central Standard Time, broadcasting worldwide from the Infowars News Center.
[03:03:01.012 --> 03:03:06.734]  And the Democrats are running around thumbing at the mouth, as they always do.
[03:03:08.737 --> 03:03:09.778]  That's their culture.
[03:03:10.018 --> 03:03:12.439]  Most of them don't have parents.
[03:03:12.499 --> 03:03:13.340]  I feel sorry for them.
[03:03:13.360 --> 03:03:14.500]  They think the state's their mommy.
[03:03:14.520 --> 03:03:18.342]  That's a little baby duck that thinks an 18-wheeler is his daddy.
[03:03:18.683 --> 03:03:24.226]  They've self-identified with it as it runs them over on I-35.
[03:03:24.646 --> 03:03:28.568]  They've imprinted on a fiery furnace.
[03:03:30.169 --> 03:03:31.450]  Donald Trump elected president.
[03:03:31.530 --> 03:03:32.770]  Even AP's saying it.
[03:03:33.551 --> 03:03:35.332]  But at 136 Central, 236 Eastern,
[03:03:40.267 --> 03:03:41.048]  We're not hearing him.
[03:03:41.489 --> 03:03:48.561]  They'll probably announce that Russians nuked New York and Hillary wasn't there and Donald was and that's the end of it.
[03:03:50.544 --> 03:03:52.708]  All I know is we're gonna continue on.
[03:03:54.229 --> 03:04:01.410]  We're going to fight the New World Order because we believe in prosperity and we don't want to rape you and your family.
[03:04:02.110 --> 03:04:05.531]  And that's why we have free shipping running for the next few days.
[03:04:05.671 --> 03:04:09.972]  A bunch of big discounts, 30 to 40% off at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:04:10.512 --> 03:04:20.134]  We have vitamins and mineral products and water filtration systems and t-shirts that are broke gone and a lot of other items that you might want to check out for yourself.
[03:04:21.035 --> 03:04:22.275]  But if you don't, that's fine.
[03:04:23.116 --> 03:04:30.618]  But there are serious deficiencies in selenium and other vital electrochemical processes in the brain.
[03:04:31.139 --> 03:04:35.460]  They have high quality storable food made in Utah, freshly packed, 34% off.
[03:04:35.760 --> 03:04:37.821]  So you're independent, not under their control.
[03:04:39.381 --> 03:04:45.724]  And it is your purchase of the products, whether you did it now or in the past, that made everything we did possible.
[03:04:46.424 --> 03:04:48.745]  So, I want to salute you all.
[03:04:49.898 --> 03:04:56.120]  I drugged my ass up 25 years ago as a high school graduate.
[03:04:58.401 --> 03:05:06.824]  They were trying to ban guns in Texas, semi-autos, and I decided I'd kick their ass, because I looked at my enemy and they were bug-eyed pussies.
[03:05:07.984 --> 03:05:09.145]  And we've stomped them.
[03:05:10.025 --> 03:05:12.046]  And we'll go on stomping them forever.
[03:05:13.446 --> 03:05:18.668]  Because big jackass crews of wimps get together and they think they can piss on people.
[03:05:19.704 --> 03:05:25.946]  They take some nice man or woman who's just a hard-working good person and they think we're wimps because we don't want to break their necks.
[03:05:26.966 --> 03:05:31.808]  And so they attack us and piss on us and do things until we finally stand up against them.
[03:05:31.868 --> 03:05:33.749]  And then they fight us.
[03:05:33.909 --> 03:05:35.229]  We decide to break their legs.
[03:05:36.329 --> 03:05:42.792]  But like the knight in the Monty Python movie, who keeps saying, I'm the knight that goes knee.
[03:05:43.512 --> 03:05:44.912]  You've cut their arms and legs off.
[03:05:44.932 --> 03:05:46.653]  They just continue coming on.
[03:05:47.637 --> 03:05:51.418]  And then you realize that you just can't give these people court.
[03:05:52.439 --> 03:05:58.641]  They won't be happy till you've metaphysically stomped their eye sockets in and bashed their brains out.
[03:05:59.301 --> 03:06:05.063]  So, we understand you can't coexist with us because we're altruistic.
[03:06:05.664 --> 03:06:06.204]  We're strong.
[03:06:06.984 --> 03:06:07.904]  We don't want to hurt you.
[03:06:08.785 --> 03:06:09.705]  We want to build you.
[03:06:11.326 --> 03:06:14.507]  You want to hurt people like a little Tasmanian devil piranha
[03:06:16.109 --> 03:06:22.512]  And so, as quickly as we can, we're just going to stomp your head in, and kick you in the ditch.
[03:06:23.732 --> 03:06:28.634]  And it's no hard feelings, but it has to be done.
[03:06:30.675 --> 03:06:39.679]  You can go around and fund radical Muslims, you can fund abortions all day, you can be a wimp and lie about what you really did, but we're going to man up to it.
[03:06:40.979 --> 03:06:44.581]  And the final equation, you will belong to the ash heap of history.
[03:06:47.085 --> 03:06:49.167]  No one wants to be around you or with you.
[03:06:51.529 --> 03:06:52.669]  I take no pleasure in that.
[03:06:54.090 --> 03:06:56.412]  But you tried to better better men.
[03:06:59.715 --> 03:07:11.484]  You may have shot humanity in the chest, but to quote Willie Nelson, or was it Merle Haggard, or was it Johnny Cash, you'll never get the best of better men.
[03:07:14.560 --> 03:07:16.060]  Roger is over there on his phone.
[03:07:16.080 --> 03:07:17.001]  Does he have any news?
[03:07:17.041 --> 03:07:20.622]  We are at 140 in 21 seconds globally.
[03:07:21.142 --> 03:07:32.706]  Millions of people are watching and listening now at Infowars.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.
[03:07:42.332 --> 03:07:54.000]  And it's very uncharacteristic that he has not taken the floor as Hillary is 218 and Trump is way above that.
[03:07:54.080 --> 03:07:55.021]  Let's put that back on screen.
[03:07:55.601 --> 03:07:56.642]  Put the map back on screen.
[03:07:59.003 --> 03:08:00.565]  Clinton calls Trump to concede.
[03:08:00.665 --> 03:08:01.645]  Oh, she claims she called him.
[03:08:01.945 --> 03:08:05.748]  Trump is at 276, Herr Hitler at 218.
[03:08:06.529 --> 03:08:09.711]  This will be a day long remembered.
[03:08:10.481 --> 03:08:12.663]  We've seen the end of the pedophile empire.
[03:08:13.343 --> 03:08:14.985]  We'll soon see the end of the globalists.
[03:08:15.806 --> 03:08:19.749]  They know they can cut our taxes and turn our economy on like flipping a switch.
[03:08:21.490 --> 03:08:22.891]  This is all Americans' victory.
[03:08:24.213 --> 03:08:25.434]  Roger, come over here and sit down.
[03:08:25.494 --> 03:08:26.474]  Looks like Trump's about to come out.
[03:08:28.316 --> 03:08:29.277]  Roger Stone is here.
[03:08:31.032 --> 03:08:34.657]  Former Trump campaign head, the man who pushed to get Trump to run.
[03:08:34.957 --> 03:08:37.501]  He's never arrogant, he never admits to all that, but it's documented.
[03:08:37.701 --> 03:08:38.943]  That's why they hate him so much.
[03:08:39.543 --> 03:08:43.048]  One of the few people that actually challenges Trump, and that Trump actually listens to.
[03:08:43.328 --> 03:08:48.375]  Here with us now, in the fulcrum, Trump vindicated, Trump proven right.
[03:08:49.196 --> 03:08:50.277]  Now we've got to keep him honest.
[03:08:50.677 --> 03:08:53.940]  Now we've got to dominate the globalists that will try to go after him.
[03:08:54.140 --> 03:08:56.081]  We have to defend him, while we support him.
[03:08:56.642 --> 03:09:01.605]  We've got this great crew from Nico Acosta, to everybody else that's here tonight, making this all possible.
[03:09:02.085 --> 03:09:03.306]  Make America Great Again.
[03:09:03.526 --> 03:09:06.148]  We'll always remember it.
[03:09:06.168 --> 03:09:08.050]  1.42 Central Standard Time.
[03:09:09.827 --> 03:09:25.613]  The fall of the mainstream media, the fall of the parasite scum, not some Valhalla, not some heaven, not some utopia, but a chance at not being weirdo globalists with WikiLeaks emails about how they want to screw old ladies and rob people.
[03:09:26.514 --> 03:09:30.555]  No, a system based on building a future and not being scumbags.
[03:09:31.035 --> 03:09:32.536]  We're awaiting Donald Trump.
[03:09:33.156 --> 03:09:35.497]  Roger Stone, this is a surreal moment for you.
[03:09:35.937 --> 03:09:36.978]  Tell us your heart and soul.
[03:09:38.626 --> 03:09:42.170]  You know, Alex, I wanted Donald Trump to run for president as early as 1988.
[03:09:42.651 --> 03:09:50.940]  I arranged for him to speak to the Chamber of Commerce in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
[03:09:51.982 --> 03:09:53.463]  And a Portsmouth City Councilman
[03:09:54.309 --> 03:09:59.813]  A man named Mike Dunbar formed the first known draft Trump for President committee.
[03:10:00.633 --> 03:10:03.935]  He was still working for Trump in the most recent New Hampshire primary.
[03:10:03.955 --> 03:10:08.478]  Now you gave me a six months ago like a big present, oh here's a Donald Trump 2000 thing, nobody's got this.
[03:10:08.778 --> 03:10:18.765]  Yeah, so in 2000 I wanted him to seek the Reform Party nomination because I could see that George Bush and Al Gore were not what America needed.
[03:10:20.176 --> 03:10:23.437]  And he did seriously consider that, briefly.
[03:10:24.638 --> 03:10:26.438]  Ross Perot urged him to run.
[03:10:26.498 --> 03:10:29.779]  My friend Jesse Ventura, then governor of Minnesota, urged him to run.
[03:10:31.320 --> 03:10:32.920]  And he did look at it.
[03:10:33.300 --> 03:10:36.721]  And of course, the Reform Party then was entitled to federal matching funds.
[03:10:36.801 --> 03:10:40.902]  So he would have been running on OPM, other people's money.
[03:10:41.863 --> 03:10:47.184]  In the end, he made what I think was a shrewd calculation that you couldn't win as a third party candidate.
[03:10:47.204 --> 03:10:49.405]  You could only win as a Republican or a Democrat.
[03:10:50.208 --> 03:10:51.828]  Three years ago, I wanted him to run.
[03:10:51.908 --> 03:10:55.549]  I signed up again as a consultant to his exploratory effort.
[03:10:57.050 --> 03:10:59.790]  And the time was really not quite right.
[03:11:00.150 --> 03:11:01.991]  I was probably more for it than he was.
[03:11:02.771 --> 03:11:06.552]  So this has been a long time coming for me.
[03:11:06.572 --> 03:11:14.674]  I have taken the beating from my friends and some people who aren't my friends for 30 years of saying, oh, Donald Trump, come on.
[03:11:15.054 --> 03:11:16.014]  You're out of your mind.
[03:11:16.034 --> 03:11:17.375]  Hill's never going to run.
[03:11:17.395 --> 03:11:18.255]  This is all about
[03:11:18.775 --> 03:11:19.896]  Furnishing the brand.
[03:11:19.936 --> 03:11:25.299]  This is all about his, you know, the fact that he's a media whore and he just likes to read his name.
[03:11:25.339 --> 03:11:26.600]  He's never really going to do it.
[03:11:27.481 --> 03:11:29.422]  So, this is vindication.
[03:11:30.303 --> 03:11:32.765]  They've been proven wrong in space.
[03:11:32.865 --> 03:11:33.465]  Boy, have they.
[03:11:33.645 --> 03:11:35.466]  A royal flush for Roger Stone.
[03:11:36.007 --> 03:11:37.608]  It is a great night.
[03:11:37.948 --> 03:11:40.530]  I can't wait to hear what he has to say here.
[03:11:40.550 --> 03:11:45.153]  I would like him to claim this so that the moment will be complete.
[03:11:46.872 --> 03:11:49.875]  And it's 1.44, about to be 1.45 central time.
[03:11:50.616 --> 03:11:52.437]  I'm here with Roger Stone.
[03:11:53.078 --> 03:11:55.200]  History is happening now.
[03:11:55.260 --> 03:11:55.901]  There's Donald Trump.
[03:11:55.921 --> 03:11:56.701]  Let's fade up the audio.
[03:11:56.901 --> 03:11:58.543]  There's Pence, the vice president.
[03:11:58.563 --> 03:11:59.244]  There's the family.
[03:11:59.364 --> 03:12:01.506]  That is now the president, vice president-elect.
[03:12:03.462 --> 03:12:05.283]  Pence is preparing to come down.
[03:12:05.303 --> 03:12:22.954]  This is just a repudiation of the establishment, a repudiation of all their evil, all their lies, all their stuck-upness, all these, I don't say ugly, but these ugly-looking dumbasses that hijack the country, just pissing on us.
[03:12:23.734 --> 03:12:27.755]  We see the bikers for Trump with their sign, a great bunch of guys.
[03:12:27.875 --> 03:12:29.176]  They're going to try to hit us, though.
[03:12:29.256 --> 03:12:30.656]  So, we're about to hear this.
[03:12:30.676 --> 03:12:32.997]  This is Pence, Vice President, Governor of Indiana.
[03:12:33.317 --> 03:12:33.997]  We're hearing this now.
[03:12:34.057 --> 03:12:35.937]  Roger, let's hear from Pence.
[03:12:35.957 --> 03:12:36.358]  Get ready.
[03:12:36.678 --> 03:12:37.258]  This is it.
[03:12:37.298 --> 03:12:38.818]  This is the rebirth of the Republic.
[03:12:39.218 --> 03:12:40.239]  This is happening now.
[03:12:40.979 --> 03:12:43.319]  Infowars is the tip of the... It's crazy.
[03:12:43.540 --> 03:12:45.920]  We're the tip of the spear.
[03:12:45.980 --> 03:12:46.680]  Yes, indeed.
[03:12:46.700 --> 03:12:47.201]  This is it.
[03:12:47.221 --> 03:12:47.661]  1776 reborn.
[03:12:49.101 --> 03:12:51.462]  If they stay true, they will save the planet.
[03:12:51.802 --> 03:12:52.302]  If they don't,
[03:12:53.513 --> 03:12:56.035]  They don't, we'll be out attacking them.
[03:12:56.195 --> 03:12:58.417]  This is a historic night.
[03:13:05.643 --> 03:13:11.768]  The American people have spoken and the American people have elected their new champion.
[03:13:17.592 --> 03:13:22.737]  America has elected a new president and it's almost hard for me to express
[03:13:24.468 --> 03:13:33.033]  The honor that I and my family feel that we will have the privilege to serve as your Vice President of the United States of America.
[03:13:33.053 --> 03:13:37.495]  Cut those taxes, man, and cut the spending right now.
[03:13:37.535 --> 03:13:38.516]  Restore the Republic.
[03:13:38.556 --> 03:13:39.496]  Put us back online.
[03:13:39.636 --> 03:13:39.936]  Do it.
[03:13:40.737 --> 03:13:41.777]  And we just lost the streaming.
[03:13:41.837 --> 03:13:42.478]  This is incredible.
[03:13:42.518 --> 03:13:43.038]  Go to Fox.
[03:13:43.898 --> 03:13:44.499]  It'll be everywhere.
[03:13:44.519 --> 03:13:47.660]  Our son, Michael, and his fiancee, Sarah.
[03:13:49.161 --> 03:13:52.103]  Our daughter, Audrey, far away.
[03:13:52.143 --> 03:13:54.064]  And our daughter, Charlotte.
[03:13:56.428 --> 03:13:57.769]  I could not be here without them.
[03:13:58.850 --> 03:14:00.091]  Let's blow that up.
[03:14:01.092 --> 03:14:09.198]  I'm deeply grateful to the American people for placing their confidence in this team and giving us this opportunity to serve.
[03:14:09.999 --> 03:14:11.560]  Well, it is you against pedophiles.
[03:14:11.580 --> 03:14:12.661]  I mean, it's not a hard choice.
[03:14:13.721 --> 03:14:14.302]  Even against the Joker.
[03:14:14.362 --> 03:14:16.323]  And I'm also grateful to our president-elect.
[03:14:16.744 --> 03:14:18.445]  A literal... She walks around like a demon.
[03:14:18.465 --> 03:14:21.707]  Whose leadership and vision will make America great again.
[03:14:23.789 --> 03:14:26.051]  Yeah, which means cut our taxes immediately.
[03:14:28.058 --> 03:14:29.319]  I can do loopholes without taxes.
[03:14:29.439 --> 03:14:30.861]  I want the general public to get those.
[03:14:31.161 --> 03:14:31.682]  Here we go.
[03:14:31.702 --> 03:14:32.443]  This is it.
[03:14:32.463 --> 03:14:33.383]  Is this Valhalla?
[03:14:33.403 --> 03:14:35.145]  Is this the best moment in your political life?
[03:14:36.166 --> 03:14:36.647]  It's amazing.
[03:14:46.747 --> 03:14:48.450]  Right now, a historic moment.
[03:14:48.710 --> 03:14:51.214]  We can now project the winner of the presidential race.
[03:14:51.234 --> 03:14:57.303]  CNN projects Donald Trump wins the presidency.
[03:14:57.343 --> 03:14:58.945]  You know Wolf is choking on this.
[03:15:02.389 --> 03:15:03.509]  Schreier, get in here.
[03:15:03.529 --> 03:15:04.450]  Everybody get in here.
[03:15:04.490 --> 03:15:06.210]  Get Leon in here.
[03:15:06.250 --> 03:15:08.031]  He better deliver now, though.
[03:15:08.071 --> 03:15:08.911]  He told me he will.
[03:15:08.931 --> 03:15:10.691]  He said he will.
[03:15:11.232 --> 03:15:13.792]  His spirit was so much better than mine.
[03:15:13.932 --> 03:15:15.113]  Oh, give me a campaign immediately.
[03:15:15.133 --> 03:15:15.813]  Now you're talking.
[03:15:15.833 --> 03:15:16.593]  Now you're talking.
[03:15:16.633 --> 03:15:17.053]  He's a spirit.
[03:15:17.113 --> 03:15:17.813]  He's gonna watch us.
[03:15:17.873 --> 03:15:18.534]  Thank you.
[03:15:18.614 --> 03:15:18.954]  I love you.
[03:15:18.994 --> 03:15:19.634]  I love you guys.
[03:15:19.694 --> 03:15:20.774]  I love all of you.
[03:15:30.837 --> 03:15:33.099]  These bankers want to keep us poor?
[03:15:33.179 --> 03:15:36.042]  Need tax exempt while they F us?
[03:15:36.062 --> 03:15:38.665]  Get ready, you're about to get F'd right back.
[03:15:38.945 --> 03:15:39.926]  And Islamists?
[03:15:40.066 --> 03:15:41.828]  Here come cruise missiles.
[03:15:42.308 --> 03:15:43.950]  God, Buckley, this is the good stuff.
[03:15:44.150 --> 03:15:46.652]  Uma's getting moved out of Pennsylvania, haven't him?
[03:15:51.636 --> 03:15:55.080]  I think one's going to jail.
[03:15:55.241 --> 03:15:56.862]  No more spirit, lenders?
[03:15:57.063 --> 03:16:00.146]  I hear that she and her husband are both plea bargained.
[03:16:00.186 --> 03:16:01.868]  Let's get ready, here goes Trump!
[03:16:02.942 --> 03:16:06.164]  Turn it up, Donald J. Trump.
[03:16:06.184 --> 03:16:10.307]  The Golden Toad.
[03:16:11.548 --> 03:16:12.109]  Get ready.
[03:16:13.149 --> 03:16:14.811]  He charges into a goblin's nest.
[03:16:14.831 --> 03:16:15.871]  This is amazing.
[03:16:16.031 --> 03:16:21.595]  As long as he doesn't... As long as he doesn't kiss a goblin, goblins vomit.
[03:16:21.695 --> 03:16:22.816]  Catch him in bed with a goblin.
[03:16:23.076 --> 03:16:25.478]  I don't think there's any danger of that.
[03:16:25.498 --> 03:16:26.579]  No, he defeated the goblins.
[03:16:26.659 --> 03:16:27.039]  He did it.
[03:16:28.040 --> 03:16:30.402]  Here you go again.
[03:16:34.450 --> 03:16:39.773]  I wonder what Mr. Maddow is going to be saying tomorrow.
[03:16:40.293 --> 03:16:43.355]  I'll take some more of that.
[03:16:43.435 --> 03:16:46.596]  I heard that she was a little depressed tonight.
[03:16:47.257 --> 03:16:48.077]  Oh, you heard that?
[03:16:48.097 --> 03:16:53.920]  She won't be able to make people pour and screw people over and F blacks over anymore?
[03:16:55.101 --> 03:16:57.983]  Oh, sorry, there's big tacos coming for the communities.
[03:16:59.564 --> 03:16:59.944]  Thank you.
[03:17:01.570 --> 03:17:02.370]  Thank you very much.
[03:17:02.390 --> 03:17:04.332]  Sorry, it's already complicated business.
[03:17:04.352 --> 03:17:05.112]  Thank you very much.
[03:17:05.132 --> 03:17:07.253]  I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton.
[03:17:31.395 --> 03:17:33.316]  She congratulated us.
[03:17:33.596 --> 03:17:35.016]  It's about us.
[03:17:36.137 --> 03:17:36.977]  On our victory.
[03:17:38.358 --> 03:17:44.600]  And I congratulated her and her family on a very hard campaign.
[03:17:44.640 --> 03:17:47.281]  I mean, she fought very hard.
[03:17:48.521 --> 03:17:53.343]  Hillary has worked
[03:17:54.622 --> 03:17:58.123]  Very long and very hard over a long period of time.
[03:17:58.143 --> 03:17:59.124]  She worked hard to bring us down.
[03:17:59.244 --> 03:18:02.465]  And we owe her a major debt of gratitude.
[03:18:02.525 --> 03:18:03.685]  Let's arrest her immediately.
[03:18:03.965 --> 03:18:05.326]  To our country.
[03:18:05.666 --> 03:18:06.686]  Oh, I don't like this.
[03:18:06.726 --> 03:18:07.426]  Very sincere.
[03:18:07.586 --> 03:18:09.067]  I know he's got to be gracious.
[03:18:09.147 --> 03:18:13.828]  Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division.
[03:18:14.089 --> 03:18:15.029]  We have to get together.
[03:18:15.089 --> 03:18:16.149]  He's got to be big, right?
[03:18:16.509 --> 03:18:20.931]  To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation.
[03:18:21.960 --> 03:18:28.282]  I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.
[03:18:28.302 --> 03:18:31.783]  It's time.
[03:18:36.164 --> 03:18:42.085]  I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans.
[03:18:42.825 --> 03:18:45.206]  And this is so important to me.
[03:18:47.105 --> 03:18:49.547]  Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump's our new president.
[03:18:49.587 --> 03:18:50.067]  This is awesome!
[03:18:50.147 --> 03:19:06.819]  For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country.
[03:19:07.499 --> 03:19:08.440]  You know what, I've seen Hillary.
[03:19:08.460 --> 03:19:10.642]  They're not going to back off.
[03:19:10.662 --> 03:19:11.402]  They have to laugh at her.
[03:19:11.422 --> 03:19:12.003]  I agree.
[03:19:12.023 --> 03:19:13.584]  They have to laugh at her.
[03:19:13.644 --> 03:19:15.865]  I mean, we're not looking for trouble, but if you want to fight, you've got to.
[03:19:17.446 --> 03:19:18.247]  Yes, we know.
[03:19:18.267 --> 03:19:19.588]  He's being gracious right now.
[03:19:19.648 --> 03:19:20.870]  The dead people of Benghazi demand it.
[03:19:20.890 --> 03:19:21.350]  Don't you agree, Roger?
[03:19:33.190 --> 03:19:47.183]  It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds, and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people that you love.
[03:19:55.413 --> 03:20:00.915]  We will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream.
[03:20:00.935 --> 03:20:01.415]  Can you imagine?
[03:20:01.435 --> 03:20:03.035]  They're crapping their pants right now, aren't they?
[03:20:03.395 --> 03:20:04.996]  I've spent my entire life in business.
[03:20:05.076 --> 03:20:06.696]  I'd say Soros is upset right now.
[03:20:06.716 --> 03:20:10.657]  Looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world.
[03:20:10.677 --> 03:20:11.957]  They're so upset right now.
[03:20:12.758 --> 03:20:16.239]  That is now what I want to do for our country.
[03:20:19.860 --> 03:20:21.100]  Tremendous potential.
[03:20:22.108 --> 03:20:24.010]  I've gotten to know our country so well.
[03:20:24.271 --> 03:20:25.552]  Tremendous potential.
[03:20:26.293 --> 03:20:27.615]  It's going to be a beautiful thing.
[03:20:28.316 --> 03:20:35.484]  Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential.
[03:20:35.825 --> 03:20:41.011]  The forgotten men and women will be forgotten no longer.
[03:20:42.984 --> 03:20:44.165]  We're going to take care of our veterans.
[03:20:44.305 --> 03:20:46.326]  We're going to cut taxes for everybody.
[03:20:46.706 --> 03:20:50.028]  We are going to fix our inner cities.
[03:20:50.268 --> 03:20:55.511]  And we're going to rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals.
[03:20:56.011 --> 03:21:01.915]  We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become
[03:21:03.126 --> 03:21:05.388]  By the way, second to none.
[03:21:06.129 --> 03:21:11.073]  And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.
[03:21:11.153 --> 03:21:11.493]  I love it.
[03:21:11.513 --> 03:21:13.375]  Who else would put his youngest kid up on stage?
[03:21:13.395 --> 03:21:14.255]  This is just so great.
[03:21:14.275 --> 03:21:19.039]  We will also finally take care of our great veterans.
[03:21:19.500 --> 03:21:22.622]  He feels most strongly about this.
[03:21:23.163 --> 03:21:25.925]  He's been so loyal and I've gotten to know so many.
[03:21:26.085 --> 03:21:27.586]  I've talked to folks that know the Trumps.
[03:21:27.606 --> 03:21:28.988]  They're just totally in the military.
[03:21:30.146 --> 03:21:35.491]  The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors.
[03:21:35.892 --> 03:21:37.433]  Our veterans are incredible people.
[03:21:38.154 --> 03:21:42.318]  We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal.
[03:21:42.939 --> 03:21:52.388]  I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all.
[03:21:52.408 --> 03:21:53.469]  It's gonna happen.
[03:21:54.946 --> 03:21:57.550]  Alright, we've got the Krillin here, delusionally happy.
[03:21:57.570 --> 03:22:03.077]  Let's hear Trump, what's going on here?
[03:22:03.338 --> 03:22:08.545]  I can't, I mean, look, the thing is, good people never realize we have the power over scum.
[03:22:08.886 --> 03:22:09.947]  We have to rediscover that.
[03:22:13.223 --> 03:22:14.864]  We'll have great relationships.
[03:22:14.884 --> 03:22:18.145]  We expect to have great, great relationships.
[03:22:18.245 --> 03:22:21.187]  No dream is too big, no challenge is too great.
[03:22:21.507 --> 03:22:25.028]  Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.
[03:22:25.328 --> 03:22:30.030]  America will no longer settle for anything less than the best.
[03:22:31.711 --> 03:22:33.432]  Listen, they're going to counter-strike.
[03:22:33.832 --> 03:22:36.453]  I'm not over-confident, I'm under-confident.
[03:22:36.553 --> 03:22:38.534]  Roger, they're going to pull some stuff.
[03:22:38.874 --> 03:22:40.195]  Obama's in for two months.
[03:22:41.119 --> 03:22:45.260]  And you know, we've got November, December, January until the 18th.
[03:22:45.300 --> 03:22:45.901]  What do we do?
[03:22:45.941 --> 03:22:47.421]  They're gonna... The pardons.
[03:22:47.861 --> 03:22:50.842]  I've been predicting this year for well over a year.
[03:22:51.302 --> 03:22:53.383]  That's where they will move.
[03:22:54.063 --> 03:22:56.904]  So he should bully Pulp and try to block that.
[03:22:57.524 --> 03:22:57.804]  I would.
[03:22:57.864 --> 03:23:00.245]  Because here's the deal.
[03:23:00.285 --> 03:23:02.046]  If they wanted to leave and quit, I'd do that.
[03:23:02.086 --> 03:23:03.246]  They're not gonna back off.
[03:23:03.286 --> 03:23:05.287]  They're a bunch of arrogant assholes.
[03:23:05.947 --> 03:23:09.288]  Yes, but they've gotten a real taste in defeat tonight.
[03:23:09.690 --> 03:23:12.492]  I thought Reagan's election was the greatest political eye you could have.
[03:23:12.512 --> 03:23:13.452]  This is ten times better.
[03:23:26.971 --> 03:23:27.651]  We're good to go.
[03:23:50.751 --> 03:23:53.773]  They are so pissed right now, all these asshole bankers.
[03:23:53.793 --> 03:23:58.215]  Crank Trump here, I want to finish this.
[03:23:58.275 --> 03:23:59.036]  Where is Robert?
[03:23:59.416 --> 03:24:00.256]  Where is Robert?
[03:24:01.697 --> 03:24:02.678]  My brother Robert.
[03:24:04.759 --> 03:24:07.881]  And they should all be on this stage, but that's okay.
[03:24:09.341 --> 03:24:09.942]  They are great.
[03:24:10.022 --> 03:24:15.165]  And also my late brother Fred, great guy, fantastic guy.
[03:24:15.245 --> 03:24:17.106]  Fantastic family, I was very lucky.
[03:24:18.120 --> 03:24:21.902]  Great brothers, sisters, great, unbelievable parents.
[03:24:22.743 --> 03:24:30.407]  To Melania, and Don, and Ivanka, and Tiffany, and Barron,
[03:24:46.294 --> 03:24:52.222]  I love you and I thank you and especially for putting up with all of those hours.
[03:24:52.302 --> 03:24:53.424]  This was tough.
[03:24:54.726 --> 03:24:55.747]  This was tough.
[03:24:58.091 --> 03:25:00.935]  This political stuff is nasty and it's tough.
[03:25:01.912 --> 03:25:03.853]  So I want to thank my family very much.
[03:25:04.153 --> 03:25:05.293]  Really fantastic.
[03:25:05.313 --> 03:25:05.934]  Thank you all.
[03:25:06.454 --> 03:25:07.074]  Thank you all.
[03:25:07.214 --> 03:25:08.835]  And Lara, unbelievable job.
[03:25:09.515 --> 03:25:10.255]  Unbelievable.
[03:25:10.295 --> 03:25:11.035]  Vanessa, thank you.
[03:25:11.075 --> 03:25:13.216]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just beat the media.
[03:25:13.396 --> 03:25:14.457]  We beat George Soros.
[03:25:14.517 --> 03:25:15.937]  We beat the Rothschilds.
[03:25:16.177 --> 03:25:17.218]  We beat the Rockefellers.
[03:25:17.278 --> 03:25:19.959]  You've all given me such incredible support.
[03:25:20.079 --> 03:25:23.480]  And I will tell you that we have a large group of people.
[03:25:23.520 --> 03:25:25.341]  You know, they kept saying we have a small staff.
[03:25:25.361 --> 03:25:26.081]  That's so small.
[03:25:26.121 --> 03:25:27.522]  Look at all the people that we have.
[03:25:27.882 --> 03:25:29.042]  Look at all of these people.
[03:25:29.883 --> 03:25:30.803]  And Kellyanne.
[03:25:31.725 --> 03:25:37.348]  Well, now we gotta make sure we build this country and hire people and really do good.
[03:25:37.368 --> 03:25:40.250]  We gotta deliver now, Roger.
[03:25:41.150 --> 03:25:44.312]  We just promised people we're gonna give them jobs and build this country.
[03:25:44.332 --> 03:25:45.893]  I'm gonna bust my ass to do it.
[03:25:45.913 --> 03:25:47.894]  You know how it is when you run a company.
[03:25:47.914 --> 03:25:49.635]  You want to believe in your people.
[03:25:49.855 --> 03:25:50.636]  They belong to you.
[03:25:50.656 --> 03:25:52.217]  They're part of you.
[03:25:52.257 --> 03:25:52.737]  They help you.
[03:25:52.757 --> 03:25:53.277]  You help them.
[03:25:56.159 --> 03:25:56.499]  Turn it up.
[03:25:59.201 --> 03:26:05.366]  He traveled with us, and he went through meetings, and... Hey, that Rudy never changes.
[03:26:05.406 --> 03:26:05.987]  Where's Rudy?
[03:26:06.447 --> 03:26:06.947]  Where is he?
[03:26:08.128 --> 03:26:08.729]  Oh, Rudy.
[03:26:08.929 --> 03:26:09.369]  Rudy.
[03:26:10.891 --> 03:26:16.195]  Governor Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable.
[03:26:16.255 --> 03:26:17.856]  He lost all the weight, though.
[03:26:17.876 --> 03:26:18.877]  It's gonna be perfect.
[03:26:18.977 --> 03:26:19.558]  Thank you, Chris.
[03:26:20.902 --> 03:26:30.145]  The first man, first senator, first major, major politician, and let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington, because he's as smart as you get.
[03:26:30.666 --> 03:26:32.966]  Senator Jeff Sessions.
[03:26:33.046 --> 03:26:33.767]  Yay, yes.
[03:26:34.587 --> 03:26:36.168]  And remember General Flynn's there.
[03:26:36.648 --> 03:26:37.628]  Governor Chris Christie.
[03:26:37.648 --> 03:26:41.109]  He's got to jettison Chris Christie and Giuliani.
[03:26:43.979 --> 03:26:45.140]  And Rudy doesn't want anything.
[03:26:45.160 --> 03:26:45.600]  He really doesn't.
[03:26:45.640 --> 03:26:48.441]  I think Rudy's happy as we are right now.
[03:26:48.461 --> 03:26:55.924]  The first man for Senator, first major, major politician, and let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington, because he's as smart as you get.
[03:26:56.424 --> 03:26:58.265]  Senator Jeff Sessions.
[03:26:59.125 --> 03:26:59.285]  Yeah.
[03:26:59.365 --> 03:27:02.547]  There we go, baby.
[03:27:03.927 --> 03:27:10.130]  This will be a day you long remember.
[03:27:10.170 --> 03:27:10.650]  Great man.
[03:27:11.886 --> 03:27:12.846]  Another great man.
[03:27:13.007 --> 03:27:14.247]  Very tough competitor.
[03:27:14.267 --> 03:27:15.728]  He was not easy.
[03:27:16.388 --> 03:27:17.549]  He was not easy.
[03:27:17.569 --> 03:27:22.471]  Who is that?
[03:27:22.511 --> 03:27:23.831]  Is that the mayor that showed up?
[03:27:24.012 --> 03:27:25.712]  Is that Rudy?
[03:27:25.892 --> 03:27:27.613]  Oh, Rudy got up here.
[03:27:28.053 --> 03:27:28.594]  It's going on.
[03:27:28.634 --> 03:27:28.874]  It's fun.
[03:27:30.040 --> 03:27:43.668]  Another great man who has been really a friend to me, but I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats.
[03:27:44.189 --> 03:27:45.630]  Dr. Ben Carson.
[03:27:45.670 --> 03:27:46.250]  Where's Ben?
[03:27:47.871 --> 03:27:48.571]  Where is Ben?
[03:27:53.815 --> 03:27:57.397]  And by the way, Mike Huckabee is here someplace and he is fantastic.
[03:28:00.160 --> 03:28:01.762]  Mike and his family, Sarah.
[03:28:02.243 --> 03:28:03.104]  Thank you very much.
[03:28:03.725 --> 03:28:05.727]  General Mike Flynn.
[03:28:05.967 --> 03:28:06.288]  Yes.
[03:28:07.209 --> 03:28:08.991]  Yeah, Flynn's great.
[03:28:09.452 --> 03:28:10.413]  And no, this is perfect.
[03:28:10.433 --> 03:28:11.955]  The point is, he's not going to get us.
[03:28:12.415 --> 03:28:13.637]  This is a major victory.
[03:28:13.677 --> 03:28:15.099]  This is going to shake the world.
[03:28:16.159 --> 03:28:17.680]  We should talk about how they're going to counter-strike.
[03:28:17.800 --> 03:28:19.041]  They're going to be counter-striking.
[03:28:19.081 --> 03:28:20.962]  We have all day tomorrow to talk about that.
[03:28:21.002 --> 03:28:22.583]  Tonight, I just want to celebrate.
[03:28:22.603 --> 03:28:22.923]  I agree.
[03:28:22.983 --> 03:28:23.523]  That's right!
[03:28:23.583 --> 03:28:25.164]  How did you possibly guess?
[03:28:25.184 --> 03:28:26.205]  So, let me tell you about Reince.
[03:28:44.534 --> 03:28:45.214]  And I've said this.
[03:28:46.135 --> 03:28:46.855]  I said Reince.
[03:28:48.035 --> 03:28:48.616]  And I know it.
[03:28:48.916 --> 03:28:49.316]  I know it.
[03:28:49.356 --> 03:28:50.576]  Look at all those people over there.
[03:28:51.357 --> 03:28:51.797]  I know it.
[03:28:51.917 --> 03:28:54.078]  Reince is a superstar.
[03:28:54.118 --> 03:28:58.039]  But I said, they can't call you a superstar, Reince, unless we win.
[03:28:58.720 --> 03:29:01.621]  Because you can't be called a superstar like Secretariat.
[03:29:01.981 --> 03:29:10.624]  If Secretariat came in second, Secretariat would not have that big, beautiful, bronze bus at the track at Belmont.
[03:29:10.684 --> 03:29:11.625]  But I'll tell you, Reince
[03:29:12.637 --> 03:29:13.698]  Is really a star.
[03:29:14.318 --> 03:29:16.400]  And he is the hardest working guy.
[03:29:17.380 --> 03:29:19.202]  And in a certain way I did this right.
[03:29:19.242 --> 03:29:20.583]  No, I say this.
[03:29:20.783 --> 03:29:22.744]  We have reached the main shield generator.
[03:29:22.824 --> 03:29:24.806]  You may start your landing.
[03:29:25.106 --> 03:29:26.807]  Target maximum firepower.
[03:29:26.827 --> 03:29:29.229]  It's about time you did this right.
[03:29:29.249 --> 03:29:31.810]  Ooh, a little jab there for 2012.
[03:29:32.071 --> 03:29:33.832]  What are you talking about?
[03:29:34.739 --> 03:29:35.820]  I tell you, he did this right.
[03:29:35.900 --> 03:29:36.761]  Oh, he did, yeah.
[03:29:37.041 --> 03:29:41.604]  Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States, Donald Trump!
[03:29:42.245 --> 03:29:43.386]  Thank you, it's been an honor.
[03:29:43.726 --> 03:29:45.447]  Yeah, yeah, it's a great honor.
[03:29:45.487 --> 03:29:51.812]  We tried to put in our little blue-eyed baby, Paul Ryan, but it's okay.
[03:29:51.832 --> 03:29:55.035]  Tell him he's gonna get rid of these people, right, Ryan?
[03:29:55.095 --> 03:29:55.635]  I sure hope so.
[03:29:55.695 --> 03:29:58.678]  It was so important to the success and what we've done.
[03:29:59.640 --> 03:30:03.583]  So I also have to say, I've gotten to know some incredible people.
[03:30:04.343 --> 03:30:05.824]  The Secret Service people.
[03:30:10.848 --> 03:30:16.211]  See, I'm not buggered, because we're like Batman, who gets to blame for the good stuff, but he's not thinking us.
[03:30:16.231 --> 03:30:16.591]  It's okay.
[03:30:16.611 --> 03:30:18.593]  Because our listeners are the greatest people.
[03:30:19.955 --> 03:30:25.179]  And when I want to go and wave to a big group of people, and they rip me down and put me back down in the seat.
[03:30:25.699 --> 03:30:29.782]  But they are fantastic people, so I want to thank the Secret Service.
[03:30:36.746 --> 03:30:39.628]  And law enforcement in New York City.
[03:30:39.848 --> 03:30:40.729]  They're here tonight.
[03:30:41.870 --> 03:30:45.232]  These are spectacular people.
[03:30:46.408 --> 03:30:49.069]  Sometimes underappreciated, unfortunately.
[03:30:49.469 --> 03:30:50.649]  But we appreciate them.
[03:30:50.689 --> 03:30:51.829]  We know what they go through.
[03:30:54.050 --> 03:30:58.351]  So, it's been what they call a historic event.
[03:30:59.291 --> 03:31:03.012]  But, to be really historic, we have to do a great job.
[03:31:03.992 --> 03:31:06.412]  And I promise you, we will not let you down.
[03:31:06.472 --> 03:31:07.653]  We will do a great show.
[03:31:08.293 --> 03:31:09.913]  You told me you were gonna let me down.
[03:31:10.513 --> 03:31:14.194]  I look very much forward to being your president.
[03:31:15.818 --> 03:31:42.993]  And hopefully at the end of two years, or three years, or four years, or maybe even eight years, you will say, so many of you worked so hard for us, but you will say that, you will say that that was something that you were really, were very proud to do, and, and I can, thank you very much, and I can only say, that while the campaign is over,
[03:31:44.224 --> 03:31:47.790]  Our work on this movement is now really just beginning.
[03:31:47.810 --> 03:31:48.250]  That's right.
[03:31:48.290 --> 03:31:50.714]  The battle starts now.
[03:31:50.734 --> 03:31:53.559]  We have to deliver tax cuts, industry, jobs, not wars.
[03:31:56.375 --> 03:31:58.236]  Tell me, Roger, he's not going to start a war, right?
[03:31:58.616 --> 03:31:59.757]  I don't think he'll start a war.
[03:31:59.937 --> 03:32:01.898]  Please, God, I've heard enough of those.
[03:32:02.318 --> 03:32:03.318]  You'll be so proud.
[03:32:04.079 --> 03:32:05.579]  Again, it's my honor.
[03:32:05.599 --> 03:32:07.500]  It was an amazing evening.
[03:32:07.580 --> 03:32:09.581]  It's been an amazing two-year period.
[03:32:10.301 --> 03:32:13.503]  And I love this country.
[03:32:13.583 --> 03:32:14.743]  Thank you.
[03:32:14.843 --> 03:32:16.244]  Thank you very much.
[03:32:16.804 --> 03:32:18.124]  And thank you.
[03:32:18.985 --> 03:32:19.745]  That's it for me.
[03:32:19.765 --> 03:32:21.366]  I am out for the night.
[03:32:22.298 --> 03:32:25.221]  Well, let's have at least two minutes of final commentary here.
[03:32:26.202 --> 03:32:30.305]  But, I mean, this is just... Trump looks like it's 10 a.m.
[03:32:30.325 --> 03:32:31.867]  He's like, he just woke up.
[03:32:36.108 --> 03:32:37.589]  I mean, this is awesome.
[03:32:38.269 --> 03:32:39.369]  Now is the delivery.
[03:32:39.389 --> 03:32:41.570]  Because with Hillary, she's out to get us.
[03:32:41.610 --> 03:32:42.090]  We know that.
[03:32:42.770 --> 03:32:45.091]  But what does Hillary do with all her crimes?
[03:32:45.631 --> 03:32:47.432]  I kind of like saying, hey, we'll leave you alone.
[03:32:47.472 --> 03:32:47.832]  Go away.
[03:32:47.892 --> 03:32:48.992]  I get that, like, absentia.
[03:32:49.753 --> 03:32:51.793]  But we'll talk about it tomorrow.
[03:32:51.813 --> 03:32:52.794]  I'm going to go home and get some sleep.
[03:32:53.194 --> 03:32:54.194]  I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:32:54.234 --> 03:32:54.554]  Central.
[03:32:54.574 --> 03:32:55.595]  A bunch of crews about to take over.
[03:32:56.035 --> 03:32:56.795]  Who's about to take over?
[03:32:57.375 --> 03:32:58.356]  I've got the whole run down here.
[03:32:59.816 --> 03:33:00.336]  Who's the next?
[03:33:01.117 --> 03:33:01.497]  Who's the next?
[03:33:02.057 --> 03:33:05.018]  Owens Troyer is going to be on, and then we're going to have
[03:33:06.596 --> 03:33:08.077]  We're going to have Biggs and Darren.
[03:33:08.097 --> 03:33:09.178]  We're going to have a bunch of other people.
[03:33:09.198 --> 03:33:09.478]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:33:09.498 --> 03:33:14.661]  Alright, you're going to be taking calls until 8am.
[03:33:15.161 --> 03:33:16.262]  I'll be right through tomorrow.
[03:33:16.342 --> 03:33:17.362]  You're going to come in tomorrow.
[03:33:17.382 --> 03:33:19.324]  We're going to be part of the show.
[03:33:19.364 --> 03:33:19.664]  I'm in.
[03:33:20.024 --> 03:33:32.932]  And, uh, we're going to cover all this, but, uh, you know, the weird thing is, I don't have to say this to make an allegory of myself, but every time, even if some guy was like 100 pounds bigger than me, if I fought back, I'd kick his ass.
[03:33:33.925 --> 03:33:40.089]  It's just, I'm gonna be honest, it's like everything I've ever done, you two, it's like we're winning.
[03:33:41.070 --> 03:33:44.132]  It's just, they say America isn't special, but it is.
[03:33:45.173 --> 03:33:49.576]  It's like if you believe in her, and you stand for her,
[03:33:50.515 --> 03:33:52.797]  In the end, you get everything.
[03:33:53.358 --> 03:33:54.799]  And that's what made America so special.
[03:33:55.480 --> 03:33:56.581]  That's why they hate this country.
[03:33:57.202 --> 03:34:02.868]  And Trump, I don't know Trump like you do, but it seems like he dialed into the spirit of our age.
[03:34:03.909 --> 03:34:05.931]  And he knows it's behind him.
[03:34:06.451 --> 03:34:08.994]  He seems to have the confidence to know it can't be stopped.
[03:34:09.615 --> 03:34:12.778]  Can you just spend a few minutes elaborating on that, Roger Stone?
[03:34:13.865 --> 03:34:19.328]  Look, I think that we're in a historic moment where the country's in desperate trouble.
[03:34:19.748 --> 03:34:35.617]  Alex, we needed a leader, somebody with courage, somebody with balls, somebody who didn't buy into the globalist agenda, who is a nationalist, who believes in American power, American sovereignty, American exceptionalism.
[03:34:36.727 --> 03:34:49.201]  The time and the events have come together at a perfect precipice for a new American revolution.
[03:34:49.582 --> 03:34:50.363]  I'm just proud.
[03:34:50.403 --> 03:34:52.425]  This makes you believe in God, doesn't it?
[03:34:52.806 --> 03:34:57.030]  I look at everything I've done over 21 years on air, 22 years, it all was building
[03:34:57.691 --> 03:34:59.492]  Everything I did was just a launch point.
[03:34:59.772 --> 03:35:01.713]  It was all, it's crazy.
[03:35:02.313 --> 03:35:06.996]  And people that don't know God don't know that everything was this, and I realize what's coming next.
[03:35:07.376 --> 03:35:07.876]  It's crazy.
[03:35:08.656 --> 03:35:13.399]  It is a great time to be alive, but the fight is just beginning.
[03:35:13.479 --> 03:35:15.620]  Now we've determined who will be our leader.
[03:35:16.560 --> 03:35:18.482]  The globalists aren't going to go down easy.
[03:35:18.682 --> 03:35:21.725]  You know that they still have tricks up their sleeve and enormous wealth.
[03:35:21.765 --> 03:35:27.530]  Just because we got a knight on the horse in the armor with a sword, or with a joust, exactly.
[03:35:27.710 --> 03:35:29.371]  But I'm ready to follow, I know you are.
[03:35:29.391 --> 03:35:30.712]  Are you the Uther Pendragon behind this?
[03:35:31.253 --> 03:35:33.194]  Who are the characters in Arthurian world?
[03:35:33.655 --> 03:35:35.436]  He's King Arthur.
[03:35:35.456 --> 03:35:37.118]  Are you Uther Pendragon?
[03:35:37.378 --> 03:35:39.280]  I'm just happy to be called an MVP.
[03:35:39.920 --> 03:35:41.902]  Isn't that what the media shmatters from America?
[03:35:41.922 --> 03:35:44.324]  They said, thank God we stopped Stone as MVP.
[03:35:44.424 --> 03:35:44.624]  Yeah.
[03:35:44.924 --> 03:35:46.345]  No, you are an MVP, because you're real.
[03:35:46.746 --> 03:35:52.771]  So, so, I don't want to get my, am I like, like the little guy that gives them the shield in the battle, or who are the different characters here?
[03:35:53.591 --> 03:36:04.100]  I'm not knowledgeable enough to know that narrative, other than to say, we are about to do battle for the Lord, and we're going to take back our country.
[03:36:04.280 --> 03:36:05.261]  It's an exciting night.
[03:36:05.541 --> 03:36:05.781]  Sure.
[03:36:09.170 --> 03:36:12.273]  Roland Deschain is the French narrative of the archetype.
[03:36:13.053 --> 03:36:15.495]  Arthur Pendragon is the British archetype.
[03:36:16.476 --> 03:36:17.777]  And every other culture has one.
[03:36:18.398 --> 03:36:21.220]  I'm Welsh myself, from the Pendragon line.
[03:36:21.620 --> 03:36:28.746]  But specifically, this is what's manifested in the new country we're building.
[03:36:29.487 --> 03:36:34.471]  And the fact that we want leaders that aren't ready to screw us over is what's so powerful.
[03:36:36.505 --> 03:36:37.125]  I want to end this.
[03:36:37.145 --> 03:36:40.767]  I want to go home myself and get some sleep and cook my kids breakfast when they get up at 6 a.m.
[03:36:40.787 --> 03:36:41.527]  in like four hours.
[03:36:42.107 --> 03:36:43.248]  My kids get up at 6 a.m.
[03:36:43.528 --> 03:36:45.109]  We're less than four hours out from them up.
[03:36:45.649 --> 03:36:46.369]  I'm making them eggs.
[03:36:46.449 --> 03:36:47.369]  I'm making them bacon.
[03:36:47.430 --> 03:36:48.370]  I'm taking them to school.
[03:36:49.170 --> 03:36:55.613]  It's great, but I want to ask you as we sit there and spill this, you know, these grapes, this blood on the table,
[03:36:57.543 --> 03:36:59.204]  What are the big epic talks?
[03:36:59.284 --> 03:37:06.208]  Because everything the system did, every power they had, has been brought low and has failed.
[03:37:06.288 --> 03:37:13.372]  Not that we're so pure, that they're so defiled, they're so low, is why we're gods compared to them.
[03:37:13.913 --> 03:37:22.478]  And as they discover this endless cycle of how they attain power, they take us over, they think they're god, they become arrogant, they fall.
[03:37:23.118 --> 03:37:28.682]  They are experiencing now that, that which we've always experienced and knew was there.
[03:37:30.063 --> 03:37:31.905]  How do they strike back in the 21st century?
[03:37:31.965 --> 03:37:34.007]  In closing, we'll end this live transmission.
[03:37:34.547 --> 03:37:39.811]  We've got crew coming in, they're going to cover it, Owen Schroer and others, but I'm so glad you were here.
[03:37:40.612 --> 03:37:43.754]  Are you glad you came to InfoWars for this historic announcement?
[03:37:44.074 --> 03:37:47.157]  Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States.
[03:37:48.174 --> 03:37:53.917]  I'm just glad I had the opportunity to share this moment with 26 million of my closest friends.
[03:37:54.877 --> 03:37:55.918]  I'm delighted to be here.
[03:37:55.978 --> 03:37:56.758]  It's a great night.
[03:37:57.178 --> 03:37:57.899]  I'm punch drunk.
[03:37:57.959 --> 03:37:58.759]  I need some sleep.
[03:37:59.239 --> 03:38:02.201]  But we'll be back here tomorrow to talk about the challenges ahead.
[03:38:02.661 --> 03:38:06.103]  So, we're not totally dominating, but we're winning.
[03:38:06.623 --> 03:38:08.744]  This is a repudiation of the establishment.
[03:38:09.696 --> 03:38:11.517]  In spades.
[03:38:11.537 --> 03:38:13.138]  It's a new American revolution.
[03:38:13.498 --> 03:38:14.758]  We're starting over again.
[03:38:14.778 --> 03:38:16.899]  And the sky's the limit.
[03:38:16.939 --> 03:38:24.823]  When you have a leader with the kind of confidence and the kind of ability and the kind of independence that Trump has, anything is possible.
[03:38:26.084 --> 03:38:27.125]  Owen Schroeder, take over.
[03:38:27.165 --> 03:38:28.647]  We're broadcasting live right through tomorrow.
[03:38:28.687 --> 03:38:29.628]  He'll be with us tomorrow.
[03:38:30.369 --> 03:38:31.470]  Roger Stone, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:38:31.870 --> 03:38:33.892]  Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States.
[03:38:34.373 --> 03:38:35.474]  The enemy is in shambles.
[03:38:36.055 --> 03:38:36.695]  Please support us.
[03:38:36.715 --> 03:38:38.417]  We have free shipping right now on all the items.
[03:38:38.757 --> 03:38:40.299]  We have 30-40% discounts.
[03:38:40.559 --> 03:38:41.500]  We need your funding.
[03:38:41.801 --> 03:38:42.662]  We have delivered.
[03:38:43.322 --> 03:38:44.403]  I want to go to the next level.
[03:38:44.463 --> 03:38:45.424]  I want to hire more crew.
[03:38:45.444 --> 03:38:46.466]  I want to pay my crew better.
[03:38:47.766 --> 03:38:50.927]  I want to be able to be secure and spend time fighting.
[03:38:51.387 --> 03:38:52.428]  We need the funding.
[03:38:52.608 --> 03:38:53.588]  We have the products.
[03:38:53.988 --> 03:38:56.509]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[03:38:57.890 --> 03:39:02.291]  Has the Infowar, Roger, in closing, not delivered in the Trumpian revolution?
[03:39:02.904 --> 03:39:04.946]  This is the tip of the spear, as you said it.
[03:39:05.046 --> 03:39:07.689]  This is resistance central.
[03:39:08.289 --> 03:39:11.172]  We're going to cut this out so you can go home and get some sleep.
[03:39:11.252 --> 03:39:12.594]  You're ten miles from here.
[03:39:13.214 --> 03:39:13.735]  Be honest.
[03:39:14.696 --> 03:39:23.444]  In the whole pantheon, in the constellation of the resistance, the globalists, is InfoWars not the critical spirit?
[03:39:24.085 --> 03:39:26.668]  That resonated with Trump and gave us the victory.
[03:39:26.988 --> 03:39:29.451]  I think it gave us our shock troops.
[03:39:29.511 --> 03:39:36.979]  I think it gave us the army of people who went into these primaries, who worked their fingers to the bone, who delivered these victories.
[03:39:37.059 --> 03:39:38.260]  Trump said it again tonight.
[03:39:38.320 --> 03:39:39.481]  This isn't about him.
[03:39:39.641 --> 03:39:41.503]  It's about you, the people.
[03:39:42.484 --> 03:39:45.007]  I think back on the Reagan campaign and think how
[03:39:45.988 --> 03:39:49.911]  How much easier it would have been if there had been an InfoWars at that time.
[03:39:50.552 --> 03:39:53.213]  This is the new American Revolution.
[03:39:53.334 --> 03:39:58.317]  This is where communications among patriots can no longer be shut down.
[03:39:58.537 --> 03:39:58.778]  Sure.
[03:39:59.538 --> 03:40:00.859]  I'm grateful for everything you've done.
[03:40:00.879 --> 03:40:05.503]  And at 2.13 Central, if I don't ask this last question, I won't feel fulfilled like I've done my job, because I always feel guilty.
[03:40:05.523 --> 03:40:06.603]  I've got to do more to fight the enemy.
[03:40:07.284 --> 03:40:09.426]  Roger Stone, StoneColdTroops.com, tell me,
[03:40:10.276 --> 03:40:14.998]  In your educated opinion, the viewers out there watching, before Owen Shorter takes over and others, right through tomorrow.
[03:40:15.018 --> 03:40:15.799]  Spread the link, folks.
[03:40:15.819 --> 03:40:16.419]  This is history.
[03:40:19.660 --> 03:40:26.884]  What else can we do to try to secure the future freedom of everyone?
[03:40:27.084 --> 03:40:29.245]  What do we do now?
[03:40:30.125 --> 03:40:33.747]  As we have taken the day, we have won the war.
[03:40:36.168 --> 03:40:38.129]  We've won the battle, but what do we do
[03:40:39.016 --> 03:40:40.777]  To let people know we're going to the next level.
[03:40:41.358 --> 03:40:42.858]  The leader is going to need our support.
[03:40:43.359 --> 03:40:45.300]  He's going to lay out an agenda for the country.
[03:40:45.320 --> 03:40:46.841]  The attack is about to begin.
[03:40:47.221 --> 03:40:52.224]  And you know the establishment types are going to try to discredit his agenda and derail him.
[03:40:52.685 --> 03:40:57.528]  He's going to need the support of everybody listening to this broadcast and millions more
[03:40:58.208 --> 03:41:01.990]  To pass a reform agenda, a conservative reform agenda.
[03:41:02.010 --> 03:41:05.171]  So it's bottom line, you wanna fight, you better believe you've got one.
[03:41:05.471 --> 03:41:09.512]  We wanted this, we're winning, now we have to be ready for next level.
[03:41:09.532 --> 03:41:10.513]  We gotta follow through.
[03:41:10.633 --> 03:41:11.293]  That's what it is.
[03:41:11.533 --> 03:41:17.676]  Do you think they're arrogant enough to activate the Black Lives Matter, Soros groups, and burn cities?
[03:41:17.736 --> 03:41:18.376]  I don't see that happening.
[03:41:18.856 --> 03:41:21.138]  I don't think that, I think they will stop at nothing.
[03:41:21.238 --> 03:41:24.661]  They've had control for the last 30 years, tight control.
[03:41:25.141 --> 03:41:27.683]  Now they're seeing this being wrenched from their hands.
[03:41:28.263 --> 03:41:32.506]  I put nothing across beyond a war criminal.
[03:41:32.527 --> 03:41:33.547]  So we can see about tomorrow.
[03:41:33.587 --> 03:41:35.989]  So is this, is this the true rebirth of 1776?
[03:41:37.330 --> 03:41:38.711]  Sure is, as far as I'm concerned.
[03:41:38.771 --> 03:41:40.372]  This is the return of George Washington.
[03:41:40.892 --> 03:41:42.834]  This is the thing fabled around the world.
[03:41:42.914 --> 03:41:43.414]  This is it.
[03:41:43.794 --> 03:41:46.316]  We're going to go to a quick break, go back with Owen Schroeder and the crew.
[03:41:46.716 --> 03:41:47.997]  You get some sleep, I get some sleep.
[03:41:48.517 --> 03:41:49.698]  And I'll be back, 11 a.m.
[03:41:49.738 --> 03:41:52.840]  Central, Lord willing, InfoWars.com, Ford's last show.
[03:41:53.500 --> 03:41:55.161]  Spread the Facebook, spread the YouTube.
[03:41:55.842 --> 03:41:57.383]  We're going to have 100 million viewers.
[03:41:57.923 --> 03:41:58.824]  I knew it when I said it.
[03:41:59.124 --> 03:42:00.445]  We're up to almost 30 million right now.
[03:42:00.845 --> 03:42:02.226]  Last time I checked it was 26 million.
[03:42:03.459 --> 03:42:11.823]  We need a total victory, not just in this election, but just let CNN and MSNBC say, look, you had five million, we had a hundred million.
[03:42:13.083 --> 03:42:13.963]  This is what it's about.
[03:42:14.063 --> 03:42:16.705]  We're breaking the enemy right now.
[03:42:17.265 --> 03:42:18.765]  Roger, I'm so glad you spent the time with us.
[03:42:18.785 --> 03:42:20.026]  The crew's done an amazing job.
[03:42:20.546 --> 03:42:22.587]  Everybody else, the transmission continues.
[03:42:22.607 --> 03:42:23.247]  Send the link out.
[03:42:23.527 --> 03:42:24.948]  Infowars.com for our last show.
[03:42:25.328 --> 03:42:28.810]  Donald Trump is now president-elect of the United States.
[03:42:30.441 --> 03:42:34.362]  That's only phase one in 1776 worldwide.
[03:42:34.442 --> 03:42:34.862]  Get ready.
[03:42:38.063 --> 03:42:42.865]  Good job, get some sleep.
[03:42:43.505 --> 03:42:58.429]  Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by
