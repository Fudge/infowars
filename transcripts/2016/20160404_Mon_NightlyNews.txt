[00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:21.726]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:22.526]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:22.606 --> 00:00:24.887]  It's Monday, April the 4th, 2016.
[00:00:25.207 --> 00:00:26.488]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:37.713]  Tonight, Hillary Clinton says the unborn person doesn't have constitutional rights.
[00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:43.295]  The unborn person doesn't have constitutional rights.
[00:00:43.455 --> 00:00:47.997]  Then, according to Marijuana Business Daily, the cannabis industry
[00:00:48.337 --> 00:00:55.483]  is expected to reach a whopping $44 billion in economic impact by the year 2020.
[00:00:56.663 --> 00:01:05.110]  Meanwhile, a Michigan sheriff is threatening lawmakers with violence for supporting medical cannabis legislation.
[00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.472]  And look who's jumping on the driverless car bandwagon.
[00:01:09.692 --> 00:01:10.212]  That's right.
[00:01:10.452 --> 00:01:14.774]  Get ready for self-driving cars made in China.
[00:01:15.234 --> 00:01:19.696]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:09.830]  It was less than a week ago, though, the National Enquirer ran a story accusing Ted Cruz of having multiple illicit relationships.
[00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.194]  And, of course, this is very important to Ted Cruz, who has presented himself as the face of God to America.
[00:03:16.214 --> 00:03:19.336]  That's the way Heidi Cruz's wife has represented the campaign.
[00:03:19.816 --> 00:03:26.480]  And, of course, he has sought and received the backing of many important pastors across the country.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.341]  That story, far from going away, is developing more details as we speak.
[00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:41.565]  Now today, Radar Online reports that Ted Cruz's cheating scandal is exploding with a presidential hopeful named in connection with the murdered DC Madam's black book.
[00:03:41.605 --> 00:03:44.586]  And of course, this is someone that Alex Jones interviewed.
[00:03:44.606 --> 00:03:49.687]  He gave the last interview that the DC Madam had before she died was given to Alex Jones.
[00:03:50.128 --> 00:03:51.008]  She said, I am not
[00:03:51.528 --> 00:03:58.853]  Going to commit suicide, and shortly after that interview, she was found with bruises all over her body and hung from a shed.
[00:03:59.994 --> 00:04:08.119]  It did not look to us like she had been committing suicide, and nobody believed, except for those who listened to the mainstream media, that she committed suicide.
[00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.360]  Now, here's the connection with Ted Cruz.
[00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:19.046]  It is being reported that her former lawyer, Montgomery Blair Sibley, has filed an appeal to the US Supreme Court to remove a restraining order
[00:04:19.546 --> 00:04:21.948]  That would allow these numbers to be released.
[00:04:22.008 --> 00:04:25.891]  And he says the reason he is doing it now is because time is of the essence.
[00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:31.635]  He said the release of these numbers are of vital importance to the election.
[00:04:31.735 --> 00:04:33.556]  He says time is of the essence.
[00:04:33.957 --> 00:04:37.499]  It is relevant to voters before they cast their ballot.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:54.037]  The actual numbers that were taken from the DC Madam's black book, there was a restraining order that was put upon it, and he has in his filing before the Supreme Court said, if I do not get the right to file my request to modify the restraining order, and if I do not get an expedited hearing,
[00:04:54.557 --> 00:04:57.999]  I am going to publicly release those records to see what happens.
[00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:06.203]  He says, if they hold me in contempt of court for violating an order, they will not give me a hearing on, then I think they lose the right to enforce that order.
[00:05:06.603 --> 00:05:11.385]  Investigator Wayne Madsen, who was on the team of reporters, was hired by Hustler Magazine's owner Larry Flint.
[00:05:11.405 --> 00:05:18.148]  Of course, remember, Larry Flint was interested in exposing politicians in Washington, D.C.
[00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:21.470]  who were basically susceptible to being blackmailed.
[00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.250]  We're good to go.
[00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:43.420]  Then it has to be Cruz.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:52.688]  Now, another investigative reporter, Dan Moldea, who was also investigating that back in 2006, said there were hundreds and hundreds of pages that were turned over.
[00:05:52.728 --> 00:05:57.932]  He said that he did a reverse order on those numbers to see who they were for about 800 of them.
[00:05:57.972 --> 00:06:04.258]  They say there were thousands, 15,000 pages, I believe, were in the, yeah, 15,000 pages of phone records.
[00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:08.902]  He reversed about 800 or so of those, and he said, I would have known
[00:06:09.562 --> 00:06:13.223]  If it had been Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump or John Kasich at the time.
[00:06:13.263 --> 00:06:17.364]  But see, Ted Cruz at that time was not involved in the public's eye.
[00:06:17.904 --> 00:06:20.664]  He was quietly working in the Bush administration.
[00:06:20.824 --> 00:06:23.105]  Yeah, he's never been an outsider, folks.
[00:06:23.125 --> 00:06:25.866]  He's always been a part of the insiders.
[00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:27.426]  So we're going to be following this story.
[00:06:27.446 --> 00:06:32.947]  And again, we will have interviews with Wayne Madsen and others on the Alex Jones Radio Show tomorrow.
[00:06:33.527 --> 00:06:36.348]  And moving on, it was a rough weekend for Hillary Clinton.
[00:06:37.205 --> 00:06:44.008]  It's not been reported widely by the mainstream media, but it started with some comments about abortion.
[00:06:44.088 --> 00:06:53.992]  She was asked by Chuck Todd on Meet the Press, when or if an unborn child has constitutional rights, and here's what she had to say.
[00:06:54.012 --> 00:06:59.555]  When or if does an unborn child have constitutional rights?
[00:07:02.253 --> 00:07:08.916]  Well, under our laws, currently, that is not something that exists.
[00:07:09.876 --> 00:07:15.539]  The unborn person doesn't have constitutional rights.
[00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:16.499]  Okay, hold it right there.
[00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:17.199]  Hold it right there.
[00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:18.620]  Do you see where she stuck her foot in it?
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.441]  She's in big hot water.
[00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:26.483]  With not only people who support the right to life, but with the people who support abortion.
[00:07:26.523 --> 00:07:27.403]  Did you hear what she just said?
[00:07:27.884 --> 00:07:29.504]  The unborn person.
[00:07:29.944 --> 00:07:32.265]  At the crux of the matter is personhood.
[00:07:32.646 --> 00:07:39.648]  And if she's going to say the unborn person does not have constitutional rights, that is a legal oxymoron.
[00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:43.590]  But she said something even before that, where she said, under our laws currently,
[00:07:44.745 --> 00:07:46.867]  Roe v. Wade is not a law.
[00:07:47.227 --> 00:07:49.909]  Roe v. Wade is a ruling by the Supreme Court.
[00:07:50.249 --> 00:07:56.374]  And just as Roe v. Wade is a ruling, we've had other rulings by the Supreme Court that were later ignored or reversed.
[00:07:56.434 --> 00:08:00.638]  We had rulings by the Supreme Court that said a runaway slave needed to be returned to their master.
[00:08:01.198 --> 00:08:02.558]  That was taken away, the Dred Scott.
[00:08:02.818 --> 00:08:08.900]  We also had, as movies came out at the turn of the century, they said First Amendment rights do not apply to movies.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.961]  That was there for about 50 years before that was overturned.
[00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:17.562]  So we had the Supreme Court come in and say a variety of things, but they do not amend the Constitution.
[00:08:17.942 --> 00:08:20.443]  The Supreme Court does not write laws.
[00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:22.724]  That's the fundamental fallacy here.
[00:08:23.084 --> 00:08:25.104]  But she steps in it when she says the unborn person.
[00:08:25.124 --> 00:08:27.485]  Let's go ahead with the rest of her comments, because she's not done yet.
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:39.851]  That doesn't mean that we don't do everything we possibly can in the vast majority of instances to, you know, help a mother who is carrying a child.
[00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:40.672]  Stop it right there.
[00:08:40.692 --> 00:08:41.352]  Stop it right there.
[00:08:42.053 --> 00:08:43.555]  A mother who is carrying a child.
[00:08:44.035 --> 00:08:46.998]  See, that is the thing that really sets them off.
[00:08:47.378 --> 00:08:48.539]  It's not a child, they say.
[00:08:48.699 --> 00:08:49.480]  It is a fetus.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.361]  Let's continue on with this.
[00:08:50.381 --> 00:08:52.843]  She keeps calling this baby a child.
[00:08:52.903 --> 00:08:53.224]  Imagine.
[00:08:54.307 --> 00:08:58.811]  And wants to make sure that child will be healthy, to have appropriate medical support.
[00:08:59.892 --> 00:09:14.424]  It doesn't mean that you don't do everything possible to try to fulfill your obligations, but it does not include sacrificing the woman's right to make decisions.
[00:09:14.744 --> 00:09:21.570]  And I think that's an important distinction that under Roe v. Wade, we've had enshrined under our Constitution.
[00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.011]  Stop right there!
[00:09:23.908 --> 00:09:27.392]  Again, Roe v. Wade did not amend the Constitution.
[00:09:27.612 --> 00:09:30.135]  The Supreme Court does not amend the Constitution.
[00:09:30.175 --> 00:09:31.998]  The Supreme Court does not write laws.
[00:09:32.518 --> 00:09:36.643]  And of course, she goes on to talk about the fundamental right of choice.
[00:09:36.763 --> 00:09:40.888]  Now, where do the Democrats believe that you should have a choice?
[00:09:41.188 --> 00:09:43.932]  Only if you want to terminate your child.
[00:09:45.282 --> 00:09:48.947]  Not how you're going to educate your child, and not in any other aspect of your life.
[00:09:49.027 --> 00:09:51.390]  Not even about whether or not you're going to have health care insurance.
[00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.475]  You have no choice in the matter there.
[00:09:55.075 --> 00:10:00.403]  But of course you have a choice as to whether or not you want to abort that child, whether or not you want to kill that child.
[00:10:00.823 --> 00:10:12.847]  You know, when I listened to Hillary Clinton talk here, and of course the left came back and they were complaining about her unborn person comments, the manager of Planned Parenthood Illinois Action said on Sunday that Ms.
[00:10:12.887 --> 00:10:16.528]  Clinton's comments undermine the cause for abortion rights.
[00:10:16.568 --> 00:10:20.089]  She said the comments further stigmatize abortion.
[00:10:20.129 --> 00:10:26.691]  She said in a tweet, she calls a fetus an unborn child and calls for later term restrictions.
[00:10:27.091 --> 00:10:29.354]  You know, I think back to the Christian writer C.S.
[00:10:29.414 --> 00:10:29.814]  Lewis.
[00:10:29.875 --> 00:10:31.717]  He wrote a piece called The Screwtape Letters.
[00:10:32.338 --> 00:10:37.924]  And in it, you had this demon writing letters to his upper devil.
[00:10:38.265 --> 00:10:42.991]  It was a conceit that he had set up to try to teach some truths about the Christian life to people.
[00:10:43.371 --> 00:10:56.360]  And in it, this imaginary thing, he has this devil who's writing to his commander demon, and it was Screwtape was the name of the guy who was trying to do the work here on Earth, and he was constantly correcting him about how to do things.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:06.107]  And when I look at this, this is almost like Hillary's Screwtape letters, where the abortion rights people are telling her, no, no, no, Hillary, we don't use the term child.
[00:11:06.267 --> 00:11:07.948]  We don't use the term person.
[00:11:08.169 --> 00:11:09.590]  We don't talk about
[00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:10.870]  Abortion.
[00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.272]  We talk about terminating fetuses.
[00:11:13.492 --> 00:11:14.773]  How many times have I told you?
[00:11:15.093 --> 00:11:16.955]  You've got to use the right language.
[00:11:17.435 --> 00:11:20.137]  Because that's the way they control us.
[00:11:20.737 --> 00:11:23.179]  By carefully constructing the language.
[00:11:23.319 --> 00:11:33.226]  You know, the Pentagon, when they go out and they blow up a village of innocent people with a drone strike, whether or not they got an individual that they were looking for, they kill a lot of innocent people.
[00:11:34.056 --> 00:11:36.059]  They don't talk about murdering innocent people.
[00:11:36.079 --> 00:11:37.701]  They talk about collateral damage.
[00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:42.567]  And when they're trying to kill individuals, they don't have an assassination list.
[00:11:43.147 --> 00:11:44.729]  They have a disposition matrix.
[00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:46.551]  It makes all the difference in the world.
[00:11:46.612 --> 00:11:49.735]  And I'm sure that screw tape would explain that to Hillary.
[00:11:50.256 --> 00:12:01.299]  You know, we could have these screw tape Pentagon letters where they say, no, no, no, no, we had a disposition matrix and as part of executing that matrix, we had some collateral damage.
[00:12:01.419 --> 00:12:05.081]  Just as she says, no, no, we have a right to choice.
[00:12:05.361 --> 00:12:07.241]  We have privacy.
[00:12:08.262 --> 00:12:09.082]  That's a joke, isn't it?
[00:12:09.382 --> 00:12:12.643]  In this day and age that the government would talk about privacy.
[00:12:12.723 --> 00:12:18.805]  No, the only place that you have privacy, the only place that you have choice is if you want to kill an unborn child.
[00:12:19.565 --> 00:12:20.445]  And that's what came out.
[00:12:20.505 --> 00:12:22.746]  But of course it's not being covered that much by the mainstream media.
[00:12:22.766 --> 00:12:27.449]  Another thing that's not being covered much by the mainstream media is Hillary losing her cool.
[00:12:27.569 --> 00:12:30.230]  Imagine if this were Donald Trump.
[00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:31.510]  They would be all over this.
[00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:39.274]  But this is how Hillary Clinton reacted to somebody who is angry and challenging her on her Wall Street connections to big oil.
[00:12:49.197 --> 00:12:50.441]  I am so sick!
[00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:53.731]  I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying to me!
[00:12:58.456 --> 00:13:00.678]  Now you can understand why Hillary Clinton got so upset.
[00:13:00.698 --> 00:13:06.664]  I don't understand why it's not an issue for the mainstream media, but clearly it hit a chord with her.
[00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:14.953]  Because what this lady was pointing out when she asked her this question about her involvement with Wall Street, with Big Oil, she was pointing out the hypocrisy of Hillary Clinton.
[00:13:15.473 --> 00:13:19.157]  And that's where we began the broadcast with Ted Cruz and his cheating scandal.
[00:13:19.657 --> 00:13:20.898]  Possibly, his number is up.
[00:13:20.938 --> 00:13:22.880]  Well, I think her number is up as well.
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.001]  And her number is a very big number.
[00:13:25.101 --> 00:13:29.945]  And that's the number that represents the contributions from Wall Street to her campaign.
[00:13:30.325 --> 00:13:33.648]  But it's not just the hypocrisy at the top, the hypocrisy of the candidates.
[00:13:33.948 --> 00:13:38.611]  There's also the hypocrisy of the grassroots, the green grassroots.
[00:13:38.631 --> 00:13:44.676]  Now, our reporters in Wisconsin, we have Rob Dew, we've got a report coming up from Rob Dew, but also my son Travis Knight is there.
[00:13:45.296 --> 00:13:53.070]  He got the hypocrisy of some protesters who were using carbon fuels to protest the use of carbon fuels.
[00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:53.611]  Here's that clip.
[00:13:54.605 --> 00:13:55.566]  So I just have a quick question.
[00:13:55.866 --> 00:13:56.386]  Sure.
[00:13:56.406 --> 00:14:07.355]  You guys are busing down from, I can't read it right now, but buses are one of the least efficient uses, or least efficient vehicles as far as gas mileage and the type of gas they use.
[00:14:07.816 --> 00:14:09.177]  I just find it slightly ironic.
[00:14:09.357 --> 00:14:12.940]  The train tickets are really expensive.
[00:14:13.741 --> 00:14:21.307]  So a non-oil form of transport is extremely expensive, but you're looking to get rid of oil and oil forms of transport?
[00:14:23.598 --> 00:14:25.582]  Right, are you a Trump supporter here?
[00:14:25.603 --> 00:14:26.665]  I'm a libertarian.
[00:14:26.845 --> 00:14:28.469]  I'm a libertarian.
[00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:32.218]  Well, the most important thing is that we get off fossil fuels.
[00:14:32.998 --> 00:14:38.021]  And of course it wasn't just Hillary Clinton that got triggered by a question about her hypocrisy.
[00:14:38.761 --> 00:14:45.325]  Rob Doo was covering some of the Donald Trump events and of course he was talking to Trump supporters as well as Trump protesters.
[00:14:45.345 --> 00:14:52.929]  When he went over to talk to the Trump protesters and they saw his Hillary for prison shirt, it triggered these feminists.
[00:14:52.969 --> 00:14:54.590]  Look at their reaction to his shirt.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:00.682]  What do you think of that?
[00:15:01.042 --> 00:15:01.682]  First reaction?
[00:15:01.742 --> 00:15:03.542]  I do not like it and I no longer want to talk to you.
[00:15:05.263 --> 00:15:05.943]  That's okay.
[00:15:06.863 --> 00:15:07.544]  You don't have to.
[00:15:08.164 --> 00:15:09.284]  So, you're done?
[00:15:09.804 --> 00:15:10.645]  Yeah.
[00:15:10.745 --> 00:15:11.285]  I'm going home.
[00:15:11.305 --> 00:15:12.465]  Keep going.
[00:15:12.485 --> 00:15:12.865]  Keep going.
[00:15:13.105 --> 00:15:13.705]  Keep on walking.
[00:15:13.826 --> 00:15:14.866]  I'm going to stand here now.
[00:15:14.886 --> 00:15:18.647]  That's a nice jacket though.
[00:15:18.727 --> 00:15:20.327]  Maybe some assholes over there want to talk to you.
[00:15:20.407 --> 00:15:21.028]  Nah.
[00:15:23.488 --> 00:15:25.129]  Here to see what's going on with the young people.
[00:15:26.946 --> 00:15:27.926]  Oh, you got kicked out too.
[00:15:28.267 --> 00:15:29.907]  Let me recap on you.
[00:15:29.927 --> 00:15:30.308]  You know what?
[00:15:30.928 --> 00:15:31.608]  This happened yesterday.
[00:15:31.628 --> 00:15:38.231]  I actually put a video up about the same thing.
[00:15:38.291 --> 00:15:38.591]  Yeah.
[00:15:39.172 --> 00:15:39.952]  You're in our space.
[00:15:40.912 --> 00:15:41.553]  Your safe space?
[00:15:42.213 --> 00:15:43.814]  Do you have puppies or kittens in your safe space?
[00:15:44.394 --> 00:15:44.654]  Both.
[00:15:45.555 --> 00:15:45.895]  Both.
[00:15:46.495 --> 00:15:46.795]  Both.
[00:15:47.215 --> 00:15:48.296]  See, that's the correct answer.
[00:15:48.796 --> 00:15:49.016]  Both.
[00:15:53.658 --> 00:15:54.899]  Are you organizing these young kids?
[00:15:55.892 --> 00:15:56.613]  Absolutely not.
[00:15:56.934 --> 00:15:59.457]  She's a young kid or something.
[00:16:01.239 --> 00:16:01.880]  She's a union worker.
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:02.280]  Hillary.
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.922]  I don't want to talk to you.
[00:16:16.736 --> 00:16:17.636]  Stay with us when we come back.
[00:16:17.656 --> 00:16:21.698]  We're going to talk about a system that China is rolling out nationwide.
[00:16:22.198 --> 00:16:25.079]  A system to surveil everyone in their neighborhoods.
[00:16:25.119 --> 00:16:26.459]  They call it grid management.
[00:16:26.779 --> 00:16:28.400]  We have different names for it here in the U.S.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:28.940]  Stay with us.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.520]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:34.121 --> 00:16:35.182]  I'm running for president.
[00:16:35.562 --> 00:16:38.743]  Everyday Americans need a champion and I want to be that champion.
[00:16:39.043 --> 00:16:43.164]  I'm hitting the road to earn your vote and I hope you'll join me on this journey.
[00:16:46.488 --> 00:16:51.344]  As a community moves towards despotism, respect is restricted to fewer people.
[00:16:54.255 --> 00:17:02.958]  That's veteran Denver Police Officer Charles Jones IV smashing an unarmed suspect in the face six times.
[00:17:03.478 --> 00:17:07.759]  Officers accused of using excessive force on a suspect and then trying to erase the evidence.
[00:17:07.779 --> 00:17:10.280]  I'm observing what they're doing and they don't see me!
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.361]  I don't understand what's going on!
[00:17:12.381 --> 00:17:22.144]  A community rates low on an information scale when the press, radio, and other channels of communication are controlled by only a few people.
[00:17:22.895 --> 00:17:30.478]  It doesn't raise ethical questions about the use of government money to produce stories about the government that wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were produced by the government.
[00:17:30.738 --> 00:17:32.019]  How can you ask such a question?
[00:17:32.039 --> 00:17:35.961]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:17:36.001 --> 00:17:42.344]  When a competent observer looks for signs of despotism in the community, he looks beyond fine words and noble phrases.
[00:17:42.424 --> 00:17:49.967]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.
[00:17:51.129 --> 00:17:53.272]  Tonight, I'm announcing those actions.
[00:17:53.372 --> 00:17:54.533]  What I say, go.
[00:17:54.693 --> 00:17:55.094]  See?
[00:17:55.494 --> 00:17:57.337]  I'm the law around here.
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.343]  You came, you saw, you died.
[00:18:05.726 --> 00:18:11.929]  We just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:18:12.069 --> 00:18:20.473]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:18:20.914 --> 00:18:23.295]  We are trained to deceive if we have to.
[00:18:23.335 --> 00:18:24.815]  You really don't have to trust me.
[00:18:24.835 --> 00:18:25.616]  You shouldn't trust me.
[00:18:25.656 --> 00:18:29.638]  In fact, by my actually participating in that, I will taint the news.
[00:18:29.738 --> 00:18:32.959]  In communities of this kind, despotism stands a good chance.
[00:18:34.887 --> 00:18:41.049]  Nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[00:18:41.189 --> 00:18:42.249]  Helping is huge.
[00:18:42.269 --> 00:18:44.130]  Well, we're going to do everything we can to help you.
[00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:49.531]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:18:50.131 --> 00:18:52.732]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:52.832 --> 00:18:55.713]  Because there is a war on in your mind.
[00:19:02.073 --> 00:19:05.797]  Please take a moment to listen to what I'm about to break down very, very carefully.
[00:19:06.518 --> 00:19:14.487]  Because the information I'm about to lay out in just two minutes changed my life and changed the life of many, many people around me.
[00:19:15.008 --> 00:19:21.376]  I was a big sports enthusiast, but loved to eat like a pig when I was 10 years old, up to about 22 or so.
[00:19:22.757 --> 00:19:28.102]  And I ran six miles every other day and lifted weights almost every day and had a great physique.
[00:19:28.262 --> 00:19:34.408]  Then I got into radio and television 21 years ago and got so busy in my work, I stopped working out.
[00:19:34.568 --> 00:19:39.193]  And everything was okay for four or five years, but then suddenly I started putting on pounds every month.
[00:19:39.493 --> 00:19:43.096]  And in the next 10 years, I gained almost 100 pounds.
[00:19:46.107 --> 00:19:56.459]  Then about seven years ago, I began jogging, swimming long distances, and lifting weights again, trying to lose weight, and was only able to lose about 20 of the 98 pounds.
[00:19:56.859 --> 00:19:58.040]  I even changed my diet.
[00:19:58.281 --> 00:19:59.742]  I even increased the exercise.
[00:19:59.762 --> 00:20:00.303]  It didn't work.
[00:20:01.144 --> 00:20:06.190]  But as soon as I began to get the nutrients and compounds that I needed
[00:20:07.236 --> 00:20:08.177]  My whole life changed.
[00:20:08.798 --> 00:20:14.844]  I've gone from 200 and almost 80 pounds down to about 220 pounds or so.
[00:20:15.445 --> 00:20:16.446]  It is incredible.
[00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:24.635]  And in just the last three years, Super Male Vitality, developed by Dr. Grube for mfulworthslife.com exclusively,
[00:20:25.315 --> 00:20:32.462]  And products like the Survival Shield X2 Nascent Ionine have just done incredible things for my body.
[00:20:32.623 --> 00:20:40.090]  I work out less, even though I'm older, I've lost more weight, my muscles got stronger, my stamina, my libido, and so much more.
[00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:46.455]  The truth is, we went out to bring you the very best we could, true game-changing products.

[00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:09.295]  The Financial Times reports that China is about to revert to grid management in order to monitor citizens' lives.
[00:23:09.335 --> 00:23:15.599]  Now understand that this is, as I point out, it's a revival of state presence and residential life.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:25.347]  As I describe this, I want you to understand that this is really going to be a physical manifestation of what is already really happening in the United States.
[00:23:26.067 --> 00:23:32.070]  It's just that in the United States, the monitoring of individuals is done invisibly.
[00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.671]  And it is done in far more detail.
[00:23:34.691 --> 00:23:40.053]  But let's take a look at the crude way the Chinese are destroying freedom in their country.
[00:23:40.493 --> 00:23:45.155]  They said, the grid management system is an attempt by authorities to re-establish its control over individuals.
[00:23:45.376 --> 00:23:47.516]  Of course, that's what you would expect from China.
[00:23:47.977 --> 00:23:51.178]  This is according to an expert in public management at the University of Beijing.
[00:23:51.218 --> 00:23:55.360]  He said, the aim is to reinstate the idea of upholding the party's leadership.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:02.005]  They don't even make any bones about this being for their safety, for their security.
[00:24:02.465 --> 00:24:05.448]  Because they don't have a tradition of individual liberty.
[00:24:05.648 --> 00:24:06.989]  They don't have to make those claims.
[00:24:07.349 --> 00:24:11.673]  They just come in and say, this is to establish the dominance of the party leadership.
[00:24:12.553 --> 00:24:13.654]  So shut up and take it.
[00:24:13.734 --> 00:24:14.555]  This is what they're going to do.
[00:24:14.595 --> 00:24:24.683]  They say, an earlier system of neighborhood committees which monitored every urban citizen has declined since the mid-1990s as private housing became more common and social controls faded.
[00:24:25.714 --> 00:24:33.822]  See, when you have private homes, when you have private cars, and we're going to get to that in a minute, then you have more privacy.
[00:24:34.383 --> 00:24:34.663]  Okay?
[00:24:34.683 --> 00:24:39.548]  But when everything is controlled and monitored by the state, then you lose that privacy.
[00:24:39.628 --> 00:24:45.254]  But as they've had private homes, now they have to re-establish a way to monitor these citizens.
[00:24:45.274 --> 00:24:46.475]  And unfortunately for them,
[00:24:47.415 --> 00:24:56.984]  They're at a point where not everybody is walking around with a big brother monitoring device in their pocket, that we call an iPhone or other kinds of smartphones.
[00:24:57.024 --> 00:24:57.945]  It's not very smart, is it?
[00:24:58.465 --> 00:25:00.267]  So they have to do it the old-fashioned way.
[00:25:00.687 --> 00:25:04.150]  They say the system is being introduced relatively late in Guangzhou, for example.
[00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:07.473]  And I've been to Guangzhou, went there when my daughter was adopted.
[00:25:07.533 --> 00:25:07.934]  That was
[00:25:08.434 --> 00:25:12.037]  The place, not through Beijing, but through Guangzhou, that was where the U.S.
[00:25:12.057 --> 00:25:16.701]  Embassy was, that's where everybody that was adopting children from China would go for their papers.
[00:25:16.741 --> 00:25:23.167]  It was a very nice, very modern city, very unlike some of the other cities that we traveled to that were further out in the countryside.
[00:25:23.187 --> 00:25:25.009]  Of course, all the cities, even the small ones.
[00:25:25.569 --> 00:25:28.492]  Have populations that are larger than New York City.
[00:25:28.532 --> 00:25:32.555]  But Guangzhou was a very modern, very western city.
[00:25:32.595 --> 00:25:34.657]  But look at what they're going to be doing in Guangzhou.
[00:25:34.677 --> 00:25:37.419]  They say traditionally it's a more freewheeling south, okay?
[00:25:37.459 --> 00:25:41.963]  But the city is planning to hire 12,000 grid administrators.
[00:25:42.623 --> 00:25:45.705]  So that each of them can be responsible for 200 families.
[00:25:45.805 --> 00:25:50.167]  Okay, this is beyond the Stasi because it is even more visible.
[00:25:50.207 --> 00:25:58.671]  They say, like many government plans in China, the numbers appear to be based on the population of registered residents, not on the migrants who swell in the big cities.
[00:25:58.711 --> 00:26:01.352]  Now, this is what the mayor of Guangzhou says.
[00:26:01.772 --> 00:26:04.774]  He says, if a grid administrator is responsible for 200 families,
[00:26:05.894 --> 00:26:15.149]  He can roughly remember who is in his grid in one month's time and grasp the basic information of each family in about three months' time.
[00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:20.097]  In six months' time, he can count every member of those families.
[00:26:21.175 --> 00:26:21.775]  So there you go.
[00:26:22.396 --> 00:26:33.961]  It is a crude system where they set up booths with these cops, or monitors if you will, and they say, well this is going to help employment, unemployment, because we're going to give these people jobs.
[00:26:33.981 --> 00:26:48.027]  They're taking the most unemployable of the people and turning them into government snitches and government spies, because they're going to be looking at each of these families and determining how friendly they are to the government.
[00:26:49.636 --> 00:26:53.018]  They don't even make any bones about it being about crime or terrorism.
[00:26:53.078 --> 00:26:55.759]  It's simply, how loyal are you to the government?
[00:26:55.799 --> 00:27:01.482]  We're going to get to know who these families are, and then within a few months more, we're going to know everything about this family.
[00:27:01.502 --> 00:27:04.624]  We're going to know every member of those families.
[00:27:04.764 --> 00:27:09.127]  And again, in the United States, what we call that is geospatial intelligence.
[00:27:09.895 --> 00:27:11.876]  We call it human domain analytics.
[00:27:11.956 --> 00:27:20.601]  Geospatial intelligence has been the key growing sector of the intelligence community since around 2000.
[00:27:20.821 --> 00:27:24.403]  It was the first position of any importance that James Clapper held.
[00:27:24.903 --> 00:27:26.764]  And of course he speaks at their convention every year.
[00:27:26.784 --> 00:27:27.665]  We went through all of this.
[00:27:28.245 --> 00:27:29.386]  We talked about Jade Helm.
[00:27:29.646 --> 00:27:32.428]  Mastering the human domain is about mastering
[00:27:33.339 --> 00:27:45.106]  Human domain analytics to map you onto this, put you on this map, to find out where you are, to monitor, and they're very upfront about their geospatial intelligence, their activity-based intelligence.
[00:27:45.126 --> 00:27:56.334]  They want to know, among other things, your religion, your politics, and other things that they may find interesting, and they map all of that invisibly to you, invisible to you.
[00:27:57.054 --> 00:28:03.620]  You don't see it happening, because it's all done through social media, it's all done through the internet, it's all done through NSA spying.
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:08.904]  Now here's the next step where this is going, and of course this also appeared on the Drudge Report this weekend.
[00:28:09.204 --> 00:28:14.268]  China's companies are poised to take a leap in developing the driverless cars, according to the New York Times.
[00:28:14.348 --> 00:28:20.574]  And of course, where else would we expect this massive leap in anti-freedom technology?
[00:28:20.634 --> 00:28:22.735]  But in China, it's a perfect match for it.
[00:28:22.755 --> 00:28:25.317]  Now this New York Times story really kind of seems to focus
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.888]  On small entrepreneurs.
[00:28:27.948 --> 00:28:30.160]  It begins with a story about a guy who worked for Intel.
[00:28:31.287 --> 00:28:33.868]  The computer company, the microchip company.
[00:28:34.168 --> 00:28:39.891]  And they lectured them on how they needed to think outside the box, how they needed to become entrepreneurial.
[00:28:39.931 --> 00:28:41.852]  He took it to heart and he started his own company.
[00:28:42.232 --> 00:28:45.253]  He started this self-driving car company.
[00:28:45.293 --> 00:28:52.116]  So they talk a lot about all the entrepreneurship in China, but they focus on the driverless cars as well.
[00:28:52.156 --> 00:28:53.036]  This is what they have to say.
[00:28:53.497 --> 00:28:58.299]  Conditions in China are actually far more favorable for quick adoption of driverless cars.
[00:28:58.359 --> 00:28:58.719]  In part,
[00:28:59.179 --> 00:29:16.194]  Because of more aggressive support from the national and local governments, considering the fact that here in the United States they have poured in billions of dollars of subsidy for driverless cars, the American government has, as well as talking about how they're going to grease the regulations and remove those regulations.
[00:29:16.234 --> 00:29:25.683]  They say, unlike in the United States, China never fully developed a romance with the open road and with car ownership, and they never understood anything about individual liberty.
[00:29:26.263 --> 00:29:30.767]  You need to understand that this is exactly what the government wants.
[00:29:30.807 --> 00:29:39.755]  Of course they're working in America with the companies who want to make money, but they want to establish a control grid to monitor everything you're doing.
[00:29:39.795 --> 00:29:47.862]  It's exactly the same as this control grid that they're setting up very crudely with people stationed every few blocks to watch everybody.
[00:29:47.902 --> 00:29:50.905]  They can capture all of your information as you're doing it.
[00:29:51.366 --> 00:29:52.346]  And of course also this
[00:29:53.416 --> 00:29:54.557]  article from Market Watch.
[00:29:54.597 --> 00:29:59.923]  I love how the mainstream media is finally picking up on the idea that this is about your control.
[00:29:59.963 --> 00:30:02.445]  They say, the police could be controlling your self-driving cars.
[00:30:02.485 --> 00:30:05.148]  Time to start thinking about the new rules of the road, says Market Watch.
[00:30:05.528 --> 00:30:13.597]  Otherwise, we may end up with some analog to today's chaos in cyberspace, which arose from decisions in the 80s about how personal computers and the internet would work.
[00:30:13.657 --> 00:30:16.339]  And of course, they point out that if they want to
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:23.989]  Arrest you, they can just pull your car over to the side, or maybe they'll just reprogram it to drive you straight to the detention camp.
[00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:26.251]  That's, I guess, what we can expect.
[00:30:27.079 --> 00:30:30.281]  Now this weekend we saw something very interesting at the White House.
[00:30:30.381 --> 00:30:36.266]  We saw a massive protest of people inhaling pot at POTUS's house.
[00:30:36.306 --> 00:30:38.847]  That's right, the President of the United States, Barack Obama.
[00:30:39.348 --> 00:30:45.792]  Famous for being a heavy user of pot, they went to the White House and lit up and only two people were arrested.
[00:30:45.812 --> 00:30:51.096]  And it's kind of interesting to see how the government attitude is beginning to change towards this.
[00:30:51.136 --> 00:30:54.659]  The demonstrators there, as you can see in the picture, say jail is not
[00:30:55.339 --> 00:30:56.540]  A drug policy.
[00:30:56.701 --> 00:30:58.963]  Well, yeah, actually it has been a drug policy.
[00:30:59.003 --> 00:31:00.344]  That's part of what's wrong with it.
[00:31:01.545 --> 00:31:09.533]  Two people got tickets of $25 for public consumption, and the rest of the people were able to protest there at the White House this weekend.
[00:31:10.294 --> 00:31:16.881]  Now, as we move forward, we see that the Vermont legislature is on track to be the first in the United States to legalize marijuana.
[00:31:17.601 --> 00:31:22.784]  And the governor, who is going to be heading out after this term, calls that enlightened.
[00:31:22.884 --> 00:31:27.967]  He says it's an enlightened prospect, according to the Democrat governor, who's approaching the end of his third and final term.
[00:31:27.987 --> 00:31:37.352]  He said there's no question that the war on drugs has failed when it comes to marijuana policy, that America is going to move to a more sensible policy, state by state.
[00:31:37.752 --> 00:31:40.093]  He said, I think the more enlightened states are trying to get ahead of this one.
[00:31:40.513 --> 00:31:41.794]  And he goes on to point out
[00:31:42.474 --> 00:31:57.144]  He says, we've been spending huge amounts of energy focusing on the evils of pot smoking and we hardly talk about the fact that in 2010 we sold enough drugs legally through our pharmacies in the form of Oxycontin to keep every adult American high for a month.
[00:31:57.912 --> 00:32:03.313]  He said that has led to death, destruction, addiction to heroin that's affecting every state in America.
[00:32:03.614 --> 00:32:14.256]  And of course, we have a serious heroin problem, and that's thanks in part, a large part, to our occupation of Afghanistan, where we have created record crops as we've been there.
[00:32:14.537 --> 00:32:16.677]  Now when we come back, we're going to talk to Lynn Ulbricht.
[00:32:17.137 --> 00:32:19.238]  She is the mother of Ross Ulbricht.
[00:32:19.818 --> 00:32:25.045]  And if you remember, he is serving two life sentences for his involvement in Silk Road.
[00:32:25.126 --> 00:32:29.592]  It is a story that is not really fundamentally about the war on drugs.
[00:32:29.652 --> 00:32:31.414]  Of course, the government portrays it as that.
[00:32:31.735 --> 00:32:36.802]  But it is a story of corruption, a story of the destruction of our legal system, a destruction
[00:32:37.162 --> 00:32:37.923]  We're good to go.
[00:33:03.556 --> 00:33:06.938]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:33:07.319 --> 00:33:14.443]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:33:15.044 --> 00:33:23.409]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:27.772]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:33:28.092 --> 00:33:33.456]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:33:33.676 --> 00:33:34.497]  We're good to go.
[00:34:02.054 --> 00:34:16.265]  My fellow InfoWarriors, I am very excited to be able to announce to you the introduction at InfoWarsLife.com of a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsLife formulations like Survival Shield X2 and Super Metal Vitality.

[00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:07.152]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:07.413 --> 00:35:21.859]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:22.819]  We're good to go.
[00:35:43.365 --> 00:35:51.211]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:51.371 --> 00:35:56.796]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a 6-day liver detox.
[00:35:56.816 --> 00:36:00.338]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:00.518 --> 00:36:04.522]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:04.642 --> 00:36:08.545]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:08.865 --> 00:36:09.045]  I'm good.
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:05.660]  Welcome back.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:09.902]  Joining me now is Lynn Ulbricht and she is the mother of Ross Ulbricht.
[00:37:09.942 --> 00:37:13.683]  You may remember his name with the Silk Road website.
[00:37:13.723 --> 00:37:19.345]  He has been convicted as the creator and operator of Silk Road and been given a life sentence.
[00:37:20.245 --> 00:37:22.646]  Now, I want to say one thing right up front.
[00:37:22.666 --> 00:37:37.151]  Of course, this involves the war on drugs as the federal government is coming after Silk Road for selling, among other things, allowing, on his website, drugs to be sold and other things, some of which were legal, some of which were not legal.
[00:37:37.191 --> 00:37:38.391]  It was a dark website.
[00:37:38.411 --> 00:37:40.472]  But I want to say, first of all, for many people there,
[00:37:41.072 --> 00:37:46.434]  You think that the war on drugs is the way that we should control abuse of drugs?
[00:37:47.215 --> 00:37:53.618]  Understand that we've been doing this now for, what is it, 45 years since Richard Nixon declared the war on drugs.
[00:37:53.998 --> 00:37:56.859]  It hasn't had any effect on abuse.
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.040]  So it's a total failure from that aspect.
[00:37:59.521 --> 00:38:02.042]  Understand also that 10 years before Richard Nixon
[00:38:02.878 --> 00:38:05.159]  We've enacted and declared the war on drugs.
[00:38:05.519 --> 00:38:10.561]  The four schedules that we now file all the drugs under, that was created by the UN.
[00:38:10.861 --> 00:38:14.002]  We are enacting a UN agenda to the letter.
[00:38:14.323 --> 00:38:19.805]  These four schedules of drugs, the population of all the drugs, into these four schedules is something that the UN created.
[00:38:20.939 --> 00:38:30.887]  If you're conservative, and you don't like drugs, and you're afraid of drugs, and you want to enable the government to use a hammer to try to stop this problem, think about those two things there.
[00:38:30.967 --> 00:38:33.609]  Think about how it has corrupted our law enforcement system.
[00:38:33.649 --> 00:38:36.772]  That's one of the key things we're going to be talking to Lynn Ulbricht about.
[00:38:37.412 --> 00:38:42.996]  Think about the fact that we've imprisoned a greater number of people in our society than any society in history.
[00:38:43.837 --> 00:38:45.979]  Greater than the Chinese Communist Society.
[00:38:46.019 --> 00:38:49.902]  Greater than the number of people that were imprisoned by Stalin under his regime.
[00:38:50.763 --> 00:38:53.906]  This, however, has been a bonanza for organized crime.
[00:38:54.066 --> 00:38:56.048]  It has been a bonanza for the police state.
[00:38:56.068 --> 00:39:00.852]  And quite frankly, it is difficult to separate organized crime from the police state.
[00:39:00.872 --> 00:39:02.574]  And that's one of the things that we want to talk about.
[00:39:03.314 --> 00:39:08.979]  Is the people that were investigating Silk Road, who have now been charged with issues.
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.882]  But where do you want to start with this, Lynn?
[00:39:12.102 --> 00:39:18.408]  We've got people, as you were telling me before we began the interview, Ross got a life sentence.
[00:39:18.729 --> 00:39:19.369]  Double.
[00:39:19.469 --> 00:39:19.930]  Double life.
[00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:21.491]  Plus 40 years for good measure.
[00:39:21.631 --> 00:39:22.212]  Wow.
[00:39:22.332 --> 00:39:26.336]  And yet, the people who were actually selling drugs, tell us about what they got.
[00:39:27.369 --> 00:39:32.155]  The top drug dealer who was convicted for being the top drug dealer got 10 years.
[00:39:32.977 --> 00:39:38.684]  The person convicted for being the top cocaine and heroin dealer on Silk Road, 5 years.
[00:39:39.265 --> 00:39:39.465]  Wow.
[00:39:39.666 --> 00:39:43.831]  Just today I read that the top admin of Silk Road 2 is looking at 8 years.
[00:39:44.452 --> 00:39:44.592]  Wow.
[00:39:45.527 --> 00:39:49.029]  And then we've got the government agents who are running the investigation.
[00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:50.110]  Six and seven years.
[00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:50.651]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:50.971 --> 00:39:58.116]  And one of them was convicted of $800,000 that he embezzled and he was with the Secret Service.
[00:39:58.156 --> 00:39:59.196]  That was Sean Bridges.
[00:39:59.276 --> 00:40:02.759]  Carl Forrest of the DEA was also convicted and imprisoned.
[00:40:02.799 --> 00:40:06.281]  And then this is an article that goes back to February this year.
[00:40:06.301 --> 00:40:09.183]  Now Sean Bridges was a former Secret Service agent.
[00:40:09.223 --> 00:40:14.967]  He was part of the team that investigated Silk Road and we'll talk about that too because that really tainted the investigation.
[00:40:15.507 --> 00:40:31.359]  He was newly arrested in February at his home, the day before he was scheduled to hand himself in to begin his prison sentence, and according to court documents, officers found bags containing his passport, a notarized copy of his passport, as well as corporate records for three offshore entities.
[00:40:33.418 --> 00:40:34.319]  So tell us about that.
[00:40:34.719 --> 00:40:45.313]  They would not allow the defense team to tell the jury about these corrupt officers, and they knew about this before the trial occurred.
[00:40:45.373 --> 00:40:45.894]  Absolutely.
[00:40:46.214 --> 00:40:49.939]  And I just want to say something to what you said before, which is, I'm not for drugs either.
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:54.204]  You know, I would recommend don't do them, okay?
[00:40:54.684 --> 00:40:57.867]  But the drug war is not really about drugs, in my opinion.
[00:40:58.688 --> 00:41:00.870]  And if they were, it doesn't work.
[00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:02.392]  So they would think of something else.
[00:41:02.752 --> 00:41:05.195]  And I think it's more about government expansion and intrusion.
[00:41:05.635 --> 00:41:06.196]  That's right.
[00:41:06.256 --> 00:41:22.251]  They've used this as a technique and of course we've reported many times about how the production of opium in Afghanistan had been taken down to only about 10% of the world's supply until we took over Afghanistan and now it's up to nearly 100% of the world's supply.
[00:41:22.271 --> 00:41:28.877]  A record crop every year that we see there and of course they use that just like they used the bringing in
[00:41:30.018 --> 00:41:32.359]  The crack cocaine epidemic from Central and South America.
[00:41:32.419 --> 00:41:37.600]  They use that to fund their secret wars, but they also use it to expand the police state and the surveillance state.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:44.862]  And so there's a key thing that we're going to talk about this as well, and that is the political considerations, legal considerations of general warrants.
[00:41:44.902 --> 00:41:54.245]  But before we get into all that, let's talk about these particular agents and what happened at the trial that should concern people about how they shut down the information to the jury.
[00:41:54.585 --> 00:42:04.773]  Right, well the fact that these agents were, they knew that they were stealing from the site, they knew that they had high-level administrative access, they had basically the keys to the kingdom, and we talked about that in our last interview.
[00:42:05.354 --> 00:42:12.780]  They could change passwords, PIN numbers, commandeer accounts, they could act as DPR, they had all kinds of aliases, they could do pretty much what they wanted, change chats.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.221]  They could set up somebody as a password.
[00:42:14.241 --> 00:42:14.962]  Totally could.
[00:42:15.142 --> 00:42:20.326]  They could do pretty much what they wanted to do, and they had the motive to do that, because they were stealing over a million dollars over here.
[00:42:21.407 --> 00:42:23.108]  This was not allowed to be known to the jury.
[00:42:23.809 --> 00:42:32.899]  This is a direct violation of the Brady Rule, which says it is illegal not to let exculpatory evidence favorable to a defendant be known to a jury.
[00:42:33.719 --> 00:42:41.267]  And yet, the court allowed the prosecution's argument, and the jury had no idea about these guys.
[00:42:42.388 --> 00:42:43.889]  And it only came out two months later.
[00:42:43.909 --> 00:43:05.556]  This is what we see over and over again, whether it's the war on drugs or whether it's the war on terror, the government continually comes in and says, we have this objective, whether it's to keep us safe from drugs or to keep us safe from terror, and to achieve this objective we're going to set aside the law, we're going to set aside the procedure, and we're just going to ram this through because that gets in our way.
[00:43:06.527 --> 00:43:21.463]  Yeah, and I very much wonder, and I think the prosecution thought, that if the jury had known about these corrupt agents, it would have cast reasonable doubt on the evidence that they were being presented with and the guilt of the defendant, Ross.
[00:43:22.124 --> 00:43:24.026]  And they were not going to let that be known.
[00:43:25.167 --> 00:43:26.369]  They fought tooth and nail.
[00:43:26.957 --> 00:43:46.646]  And I think one of the things that is really going to be necessary for us to get our freedoms back, because the system I believe is so corrupt in Washington, it doesn't matter who we elect as president, because we have these bureaucracies that are essentially writing the laws, have their own police forces, have in many cases their own courts, but they're writing roughshod over the Constitution and our legal system.
[00:43:47.067 --> 00:43:51.789]  I don't think we're going to be able to shut this down unless we do it at the local level with jury nullification.
[00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:53.850]  There were some people at your son's trial
[00:43:54.371 --> 00:43:57.899]  We're trying to inform the jury about jury nullification in a generalized way.
[00:43:57.919 --> 00:43:58.802]  Tell us what happened there.
[00:43:59.406 --> 00:44:06.070]  Um, they were handing out pamphlets and there were some signs around the courthouse informing jurors of their rights.
[00:44:06.791 --> 00:44:10.913]  And, uh, the judge said if they didn't leave by the next day, she would sequester the jury.
[00:44:11.373 --> 00:44:16.256]  And the thing is, that's usually reserved for mafia bosses and violent people who are threatening a jury.
[00:44:16.817 --> 00:44:18.878]  And so that casts that kind of... For their protection, yeah.
[00:44:18.898 --> 00:44:19.538]  Yeah, for their protection.
[00:44:19.558 --> 00:44:23.081]  But in this case, they're trying to keep the jury from seeing something.
[00:44:23.121 --> 00:44:24.141]  Protect them from pamphlets.
[00:44:24.261 --> 00:44:24.762]  Exactly.
[00:44:25.082 --> 00:44:27.523]  Protect them from information that could be damaging to the government.
[00:44:27.543 --> 00:44:28.304]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:44:28.926 --> 00:44:36.552]  And so I think really the way that, and I want to just do a digression here, I think the way that we get rid of this is the way that they're doing it gradually in New Hampshire.
[00:44:36.672 --> 00:44:56.708]  First you stop the judges from having the power to punish people for telling others what the true law is, and then you have a situation where gradually you get back to where this country was originally founded, and that was the judges giving instructions to the jurors, telling them that they should judge not only the facts of the case,
[00:44:57.188 --> 00:45:08.328]  But the law itself and how that law is being applied, if it's going to be cruel and unusual or excessive punishment like it was in your son's case, that had a political dimension to it as well, didn't it?
[00:45:08.803 --> 00:45:10.404]  Yeah, I've really come to believe that.
[00:45:11.044 --> 00:45:16.067]  Because of these lower sentences, this grotesque disparity between these sentences and what Ross got.
[00:45:16.787 --> 00:45:18.969]  And the judge referenced it in the sentencing.
[00:45:19.029 --> 00:45:21.750]  She referenced the libertarian philosophy of Silk Road.
[00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:28.234]  She quoted DPR as saying the government was the enemy and she said that's troubling and dangerous.
[00:45:28.934 --> 00:45:32.916]  And she was making him an example of someone who said that.
[00:45:33.497 --> 00:45:40.801]  And, you know, as far as I'm concerned, she's troubling and dangerous because political speech... Well, first of all, she's supposed to be defending the First Amendment.
[00:45:41.181 --> 00:45:43.142]  But, you know, it's sacrosanct in this country.
[00:45:43.162 --> 00:45:55.189]  If you can't feel safe saying the government's the enemy and can be thrown in prison for it or amplify a sentence because of it, that's scary.
[00:45:55.598 --> 00:45:56.178]  Yes, it is.
[00:45:56.238 --> 00:46:07.562]  And we've seen that with conservatives as well being the target of the MIAC report and the Fusion Center saying they're going to come after Ron Paul supporters and that's precisely why they gave your son a double life sentence.
[00:46:07.582 --> 00:46:13.263]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back with Len Ulbricht and we're going to talk about other dangerous precedents that came out of this case.
[00:46:19.705 --> 00:46:24.387]  There's no doubt that our country is in serious trouble right now.
[00:46:25.188 --> 00:46:30.032]  And if you're wondering how on earth we ever got in this situation, well I'll tell you how.
[00:46:30.572 --> 00:46:36.057]  When the Democrats showed their true colors, you got angry and you elected Republicans.
[00:46:36.577 --> 00:46:41.822]  And then when the Republicans showed their true colors, you got angry and elected Democrats.
[00:46:42.262 --> 00:46:52.148]  And when anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt, that's why it is vitally important that you wake up, America, and break the matrix.
[00:46:52.509 --> 00:46:57.472]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and the Alex Jones Show.
[00:46:57.892 --> 00:47:00.294]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:47:02.992 --> 00:47:04.013]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.554 --> 00:47:06.837]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.117 --> 00:47:14.946]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.468]  We're good.
[00:49:04.482 --> 00:49:14.154]  Welcome back, continuing with our interview with Lynn Albrecht, the mother of Ross Albrecht, who was convicted with the Silk Road website, has been given two life sentences.
[00:49:14.174 --> 00:49:16.397]  This has been very taxing on you personally.
[00:49:16.457 --> 00:49:19.361]  I saw that you had a heart attack back in October.
[00:49:19.881 --> 00:49:20.803]  I'm so sorry to hear that.
[00:49:20.863 --> 00:49:22.505]  How is your son doing in prison?
[00:49:23.493 --> 00:49:26.836]  Well, Ross is just intentionally positive and trying to be a good influence.
[00:49:26.856 --> 00:49:29.018]  He's leading GED classes.
[00:49:29.399 --> 00:49:38.488]  There were a hundred letters submitted to the judge testifying to his character from people who knew him, and four of those were inmates, fellow inmates, saying how much Ross had contributed to them.
[00:49:39.088 --> 00:49:41.170]  So, yeah, he's trying to stay positive.
[00:49:42.351 --> 00:49:47.997]  It's daunting, but he's handling it as well as I can imagine anyone handling it.
[00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:57.347]  And of course you're appealing this and tell us how people can help with this appeal because you're fighting the full force and weight of the federal government that can just print money at will.
[00:49:57.607 --> 00:49:57.807]  Yeah.
[00:49:57.867 --> 00:49:58.808]  You can't print money at will.
[00:49:58.828 --> 00:49:59.869]  I can't, darn!
[00:49:59.949 --> 00:50:06.834]  Yeah, it was the appeal which is a very, it's twice as long as a normal appeal and the lawyer said they could have put in more.
[00:50:06.954 --> 00:50:11.518]  There's so many violations in that trial, the pre-trial and the sentencing.
[00:50:12.058 --> 00:50:17.843]  But it was filed in January and now we go through the whole procedure of an appeal
[00:50:18.503 --> 00:50:24.925]  And it's a very important document, not only for Ross, but to protect our constitutional rights, right to due process.
[00:50:24.945 --> 00:50:26.946]  The trial was blatantly unfair.
[00:50:26.966 --> 00:50:31.107]  And of course, you know, if we don't have fair trials, we are not free.
[00:50:31.527 --> 00:50:31.907]  Absolutely.
[00:50:32.227 --> 00:50:47.352]  And so, of course, as we touched on the issues of the investigating agents who were acting criminally and who had control of the website and who could make this look any way that they wished, because they could steal money, they could put documents in other people's names, and that information was suppressed.
[00:50:47.932 --> 00:51:04.025]  But as we're looking at this, this whole situation, they focused for sensationalism on the fact that on this website, this dark website, and I want you to tell the people a little bit about how Silk Road operated, that using Bitcoin and using Tor, the dark side of the internet, that people could
[00:51:04.665 --> 00:51:05.946]  Buy and sell anything freely.
[00:51:05.986 --> 00:51:11.911]  And that was, of course, part of the philosophy, the libertarian philosophy, that the government shouldn't tell us what we can buy or sell.
[00:51:11.931 --> 00:51:13.633]  And of course, that's what the Constitution does.
[00:51:13.653 --> 00:51:16.255]  We had to have a constitutional amendment to prohibit alcohol.
[00:51:16.676 --> 00:51:24.622]  And unless they have the explicit power, the Ninth and Tenth Amendments says they don't have the power to prevent us from buying or selling anything.
[00:51:25.083 --> 00:51:26.504]  But that was his political philosophy.
[00:51:27.725 --> 00:51:37.088]  Singled out and targeted in the sentencing structure for that, as you pointed out, the people who were selling drugs only got ten years, five years, the agents got five.
[00:51:37.108 --> 00:51:38.388]  He got two life sentences.
[00:51:38.748 --> 00:51:43.210]  But let's talk about the broader constitutional issues here, like the general warrant.
[00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:44.570]  Tell people about that.
[00:51:44.850 --> 00:51:45.090]  Okay.
[00:51:45.551 --> 00:51:48.513]  And real quick, Silk Road itself did not allow everything.
[00:51:48.614 --> 00:51:53.758]  Child porn wasn't on there, assassinations, things that hurt people, and they're in the estimation of Silk Road.
[00:51:54.239 --> 00:51:59.924]  So there was, there were some restrictions, but it was intended to be a free market website in general.
[00:51:59.984 --> 00:52:02.486]  Ross is a Ron Paul supporter, he's a libertarian.
[00:52:03.347 --> 00:52:04.869]  So that, that was the philosophy.
[00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:10.193]  As far as the laptop, the search and seizure of the laptop
[00:52:10.914 --> 00:52:11.915]  Was unconstitutional.
[00:52:12.795 --> 00:52:14.616]  And it's a huge question for the digital age.
[00:52:14.636 --> 00:52:24.782]  And in fact, EFF, Electronic Frontier Foundation, has joined with National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, saying this search and seizure is unconstitutional.
[00:52:25.603 --> 00:52:30.866]  Because it was, they used a general warrant, which isn't, warrants require particularity under the Fourth Amendment.
[00:52:30.886 --> 00:52:32.947]  They have to say, I'm looking for this particular file.
[00:52:32.987 --> 00:52:36.910]  They can't go in through your file cabinet, rummage through and see what they can find in your house.
[00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:40.092]  And this was one of the things that sparked the Revolutionary War.
[00:52:40.592 --> 00:52:44.794]  Exactly, and it's what we're fighting with the NSA, is the general warrant issue.
[00:52:45.155 --> 00:52:56.641]  And of course if you go back and you look at what started all this, we go all the way back to the Church Committee hearings, the Pike Committee hearings, they looked at the CIA's assassination, but the Pike Committee hearings in the House looked at the NSA.
[00:52:57.021 --> 00:53:04.786]  And they said, you are looking at people's phones, we're going to prevent that by creating FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, okay?
[00:53:05.066 --> 00:53:06.247]  They've used FISA
[00:53:06.767 --> 00:53:19.375]  To create a star chamber court that gives them general warrants over not only our phones now, but because our phones are controlling, are holding most of the information about our personal lives, they're using that to get into our personal life and to track us.
[00:53:19.415 --> 00:53:22.437]  And it's going to get far worse as we go to self-driving cars.
[00:53:22.717 --> 00:53:23.778]  We're good to go.
[00:53:40.505 --> 00:53:46.989]  Well, that's why it's so important to uphold the Fourth Amendment, and why it's so important for this appeal to push back.
[00:53:47.489 --> 00:53:50.691]  Because, you know, we don't have these protections.
[00:53:50.711 --> 00:53:52.392]  They're trying to take away these protections.
[00:53:52.412 --> 00:53:53.512]  They've made that very clear.
[00:53:53.692 --> 00:53:55.633]  You know, they said, if it's digital, it's not protected.
[00:53:55.673 --> 00:53:57.014]  And we're going into the digital age.
[00:53:57.854 --> 00:54:01.136]  Very important, you know, principles involved here.
[00:54:01.296 --> 00:54:06.479]  When, of course, there wasn't anything about digital communications in the Fourth Amendment.
[00:54:06.499 --> 00:54:07.920]  Those founding fathers forgot that part!
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:11.441]  Exactly, so they're using that to say, well, this isn't papers.
[00:54:11.842 --> 00:54:20.865]  But the point is, they were laying out everything that was informational, everything that defined your life, and so they're laying out a principle in the Fourth Amendment.
[00:54:21.105 --> 00:54:25.607]  But they've created all these legal fictions, like saying we're getting a pin register, that they did.
[00:54:25.627 --> 00:54:27.068]  That's in the appeal too.
[00:54:27.228 --> 00:54:35.611]  Yeah, so they've created all these different legal fictions to circumvent the principles of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:54:35.631 --> 00:54:36.111]  Exactly.
[00:54:36.131 --> 00:54:37.752]  That's a good way of putting it.
[00:54:38.372 --> 00:54:41.455]  Yeah, and also the use of digital evidence in the trial.
[00:54:42.676 --> 00:54:47.521]  There was not one actual live person who said they saw Ross do anything.
[00:54:48.081 --> 00:54:57.930]  It was all digital evidence, and as a mortgage company won't accept a screenshot of a bank statement, digital evidence is known to be vulnerable, easily manipulated, easily planted.
[00:54:58.611 --> 00:55:01.574]  And of course the agents could do that too, we talked about.
[00:55:01.934 --> 00:55:19.818]  And that's one of the things that concerns us in the digital age, is that because after we set up the expectation of the public that they can look at everything on our phones, then if the government comes in and says, look what I found on their phone, even if they didn't find it on your phone, then the public is going to believe that.
[00:55:19.858 --> 00:55:32.830]  Because they believe they have total, complete access to everything that you have, so anything the government produces, even though it's in electronic form, even though it could have been manufactured by the government, the public is going to be more accepting of that.
[00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:37.655]  That's the thing I find truly dangerous about all this, is that the public is accepting
[00:55:38.475 --> 00:55:43.818]  The fact that you can accept digital information.
[00:55:43.838 --> 00:55:48.201]  You don't have to have something, as you pointed out, somebody actually seeing you do something.
[00:55:48.361 --> 00:55:49.601]  It can all be in digital form.
[00:55:49.621 --> 00:55:50.602]  That is very frightening.
[00:55:50.722 --> 00:55:50.982]  It is.
[00:55:51.002 --> 00:55:54.404]  It doesn't take much to create these things.
[00:55:54.464 --> 00:55:55.785]  It's child's play is what I've been told.
[00:55:56.185 --> 00:56:01.368]  Well, tell us now again where this is in terms of your process of appeal.
[00:56:01.548 --> 00:56:04.169]  I know that there was something at the beginning of the year.
[00:56:04.189 --> 00:56:04.970]  Where is it right now?
[00:56:05.752 --> 00:56:08.053]  Now, these amicus briefs have been filed.
[00:56:08.073 --> 00:56:22.800]  There was another amicus brief, LEAP, that you referenced, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, joined the Drug Policy Alliance, and a former federal judge, Nancy Gertner, and Just Leadership USA, they all got together and submitted an amicus brief about the sentencing.
[00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:26.221]  And then I mentioned the other amicus brief about the laptop.
[00:56:26.701 --> 00:56:29.883]  And all those have been, are now part of the appeal.
[00:56:30.763 --> 00:56:35.408]  Um, and now the federal government has until June 17th to rebut.
[00:56:36.289 --> 00:56:39.091]  And then what happens after that is the defense gets to respond.
[00:56:39.492 --> 00:56:46.578]  And then it goes through, I don't know exactly, you know, every step in sequence, but then the court looks, the appeal court looks at it.
[00:56:47.419 --> 00:56:50.622]  And give us the website again where people can... Oh yeah, that'd be great.
[00:56:51.022 --> 00:56:52.403]  FreeRoss.org.
[00:56:52.883 --> 00:56:53.764]  We really need help.
[00:56:53.964 --> 00:56:55.886]  And if you could see it as a bigger picture.
[00:56:56.406 --> 00:56:57.827]  You know, these are big principles.
[00:56:58.488 --> 00:57:05.694]  And it's a way to, if you're against the drug war, or if you can see the evils of the drug war, or you want to protect the Constitution through a case.
[00:57:06.334 --> 00:57:08.595]  This is a great, great opportunity to do that.
[00:57:08.675 --> 00:57:10.356]  And you know, we're just one family.
[00:57:10.396 --> 00:57:21.420]  We're just trying to survive while we get grassroots support and of course our own finances, which are getting smaller and smaller, to take a stand.
[00:57:21.946 --> 00:57:34.920]  Yes, well of course as you pointed out you've got a lot of different organizations that have come together on this because they used his political affiliations to really stick it to him on this double life sentence far more than they gave the drug sellers.
[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:36.521]  This is way beyond
[00:57:37.102 --> 00:57:44.867]  The involvement of drugs as well as the way they've used the general warrant to say that they only have digital evidence on this and they're going to use that.
[00:57:44.927 --> 00:58:04.999]  So these are a lot of very fundamental principles that affect all of us on a wide variety of issues and we need to wake up and see how our legal system is being completely destroyed and papered over by these actions of the government and this is just one more example of how they are destroying our legal system and of course
[00:58:05.319 --> 00:58:15.193]  Always coming in and using the war on drugs or using the war on terror as a justification because we have to be safe and we have to be sober and they're not doing very well on either one of those fronts.
[00:58:15.554 --> 00:58:20.141]  The tactic is failing to do anything other than to create a police state.
[00:58:20.161 --> 00:58:21.443]  Well thank you so much for joining us.
[00:58:21.983 --> 00:58:27.250]  And we do hope that things are ironed out in this, not just for your sake, but for our sake as well.
[00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:33.778]  We all want to live in a country that is ruled by law and not by politics and not by thugs and a police state.
[00:58:34.279 --> 00:58:35.841]  That's it for tonight's broadcast.
