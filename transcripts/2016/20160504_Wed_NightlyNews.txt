[00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:22.292]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.412 --> 00:00:23.672]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.872 --> 00:00:27.793]  It is May 4th, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:31.595 --> 00:00:36.336]  Tonight, it's bye-bye Ted as Cruz takes a bruisin' in Indiana.
[00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:42.318]  Even the establishment's last hope, Kasich, is dropping out as Trump moves on to Hillary.
[00:00:42.818 --> 00:00:48.800]  Even though she lost the popular vote, she still got as many delegates as Bernie in Indiana.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.601]  And, if you'll bear with me, I want to really emphasize this point.
[00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:56.983]  Time has not been kind to Al Gore's inconvenient truth.
[00:00:57.443 --> 00:01:02.325]  We look at the tentpole film of the global alarmist movement on its 10th anniversary.
[00:01:02.806 --> 00:01:05.707]  You won't believe what he predicted.
[00:01:06.727 --> 00:01:10.809]  Why do you directly contradict yourself?
[00:01:12.228 --> 00:01:16.380]  In the testimony you're giving about this scientific question.
[00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:19.889]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:16.755]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:18.575]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:19.976]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.376]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:26.697]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:30.558]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.759]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.139]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.300]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:02.244 --> 00:03:09.768]  The most notable news, or I guess debatably the most notable news, Ted Cruz has suspended his campaign after being crushed by Donald Trump.
[00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:14.350]  We see Trump delivers a knockout in Indiana as Cruz drops out of the race.
[00:03:15.271 --> 00:03:22.335]  From the beginning, I've said that I would continue on as long as there was a viable path to victory.
[00:03:24.256 --> 00:03:26.617]  Tonight, I'm sorry to say,
[00:03:30.356 --> 00:03:33.597]  It appears that path has been foreclosed.
[00:03:36.418 --> 00:03:40.439]  Together, we left it all on the field in Indiana.
[00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:42.759]  Help me, John Kasich.
[00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:43.819]  You're my only hope.
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.860]  I'm laughing here because today is Star Wars Day.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.201]  May the 4th be with you.
[00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:53.802]  And John Kasich put out this campaign ad saying that you need to vote for him because he's the last hope.
[00:03:56.477 --> 00:03:57.678]  And then he got out of the race.
[00:03:57.698 --> 00:04:02.041]  So I guess the Sith Lords came down on him pretty harshly and he decided to abandon his campaign.
[00:04:02.121 --> 00:04:03.422]  And we have the article right here.
[00:04:03.442 --> 00:04:09.045]  John Kasich is ending his presidential candidacy and they point out that after Indiana
[00:04:23.414 --> 00:04:34.703]  Trump has 1,046 delegates, while Kasich has just 152 delegates, and I believe that's even fewer than Marco Rubio had when he was in the race, you know, how many months ago.
[00:04:35.144 --> 00:04:51.497]  So Kasich was never really in it, and beyond that, he's been quoted as saying that he didn't have his heart in the campaign anyway, which, as we were talking about at lunch, myself and Joe Biggs, he was like, well, that kind of sucks for all of his supporters and donors that put into his campaign that his heart's really not in it.
[00:04:51.957 --> 00:04:54.539]  But the news of last night didn't just sit around the GOP.
[00:04:54.579 --> 00:04:56.381]  It also had news about Bernie Sanders.
[00:04:56.721 --> 00:04:57.982]  Some people call it an upset.
[00:04:58.323 --> 00:05:00.845]  I just say it's a flat-out victory for Sanders.
[00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:08.371]  I'm not going for Sanders, but I think the guy does need a fair shake and a fair representation in this election, and he had a victory over Mrs. Clinton.
[00:05:08.852 --> 00:05:09.873]  Granted that she already had
[00:05:10.353 --> 00:05:16.276]  Superdelegates before the whole thing even began, so it wasn't that big of a roo-ha-ha for Bernie Sanders.
[00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.798]  But it shows that people are into Sanders.
[00:05:18.838 --> 00:05:19.958]  He does have a following.
[00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.380]  We go out and we do these men on the streets every week.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.981]  Sanders, Sanders, Sanders.
[00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:27.582]  Every now and then you run into a Hillary supporter, but it's mostly Sanders.
[00:05:27.602 --> 00:05:30.264]  At least here in the city of Austin, it may be different where you are.
[00:05:30.284 --> 00:05:34.126]  So I know the guy does have support, and I want him to get a fair shake in this election.
[00:05:34.766 --> 00:05:37.248]  Because quite honestly, I don't know how Sanders would do.
[00:05:37.748 --> 00:05:37.888]  I don't
[00:05:56.741 --> 00:05:58.763]  I have to give the guy credit where credit is due.
[00:05:58.823 --> 00:06:03.048]  If you saw the Alex Jones Show a little bit earlier today, we all came in here during the fourth hour.
[00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:18.164]  And while I'm not a supporter of Trump, I'm also not a supporter of Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton, I do recognize this man has overcome overwhelming odds, a continuous negative, nasty media campaign to smear him in every way possible.
[00:06:19.005 --> 00:06:21.967]  As I always say about the guy, there are legitimate things you can criticize.
[00:06:22.027 --> 00:06:24.848]  The torture, and the wall, and other things as well.
[00:06:24.868 --> 00:06:34.113]  I know he says a lot of off-color things, but just sticking to his campaign in general, his platform in general, people so often misconstrue what this guy says.
[00:06:34.413 --> 00:06:36.935]  They say he wants to deport all the Muslims.
[00:06:36.975 --> 00:06:37.935]  I've never heard him say that.
[00:06:38.215 --> 00:06:39.876]  They say he wants to deport all the Mexicans.
[00:06:39.896 --> 00:06:40.797]  I've never heard him say that.
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:50.623]  But they have such a strong campaign against this guy, I have to give him props that he overwhelmingly trumped this, to use the word, and came out on top.
[00:06:50.684 --> 00:06:54.085]  And we see this article, and it says, the Never Trump numbers.
[00:06:54.125 --> 00:06:56.166]  You guys know the hashtag Never Trump campaign.
[00:06:56.606 --> 00:07:06.350]  The television ad campaign to defeat Donald Trump was at least, at least $75 million, according to an ad tracking firm.
[00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.193]  It comprised of nearly 64,000 ad spots throughout the campaign.
[00:07:11.693 --> 00:07:14.435]  A pro Marco Rubio group spent the most against Trump.
[00:07:14.875 --> 00:07:18.977]  We see Ted aired a group of ads, the second most against Trump.
[00:07:19.358 --> 00:07:23.640]  Little Jebby and his super PAC spent nearly $10 million to Trump Trump.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.283]  And Mrs. Clinton thus far has spent an estimated $5.2 million on ads.
[00:07:29.995 --> 00:07:33.418]  All to come up with butt kiss because this guy is still leading in the polls.
[00:07:33.858 --> 00:07:34.578]  Love him or hate him.
[00:07:34.618 --> 00:07:36.920]  Personally I'm going for McAfee 2016.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.121]  Pick your poison.
[00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:41.864]  But the guy has overcome the odds and I do give him credit for that.
[00:07:42.264 --> 00:07:45.506]  And as I was saying earlier on the show, I'm glad to see
[00:07:46.627 --> 00:07:49.889]  That a person can go against the mainstream media and win.
[00:07:49.929 --> 00:07:55.511]  We saw a similar thing with Rand Paul when he stepped out of the debates several months ago and hosted his own event.
[00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:56.452]  Very popular.
[00:07:56.492 --> 00:07:57.972]  Donald Trump did a similar thing.
[00:07:58.032 --> 00:07:58.753]  Very popular.
[00:07:59.113 --> 00:08:02.114]  And it shows that you do not have to be a slave to the mainstream apparatus.
[00:08:02.134 --> 00:08:04.555]  You do not have to go and play nice with the pundits.
[00:08:04.835 --> 00:08:06.256]  You don't have to be on their shows.
[00:08:06.276 --> 00:08:07.877]  You don't have to play by their rules.
[00:08:08.217 --> 00:08:09.677]  Let's talk about some other things that are going on.
[00:08:09.697 --> 00:08:11.038]  Something that's very near and dear to my heart.
[00:08:25.002 --> 00:08:30.185]  The subject of college and your education, because I guess I'm the youngest reporter here on the staff.
[00:08:30.265 --> 00:08:34.367]  I was the one who was in school the most recently, and I encounter a lot of people.
[00:08:34.387 --> 00:08:37.388]  We even had a guest here on the show at one point to talk about college.
[00:08:37.488 --> 00:08:40.289]  Now, to be very clear, I think higher education is good.
[00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:42.450]  I think your education or your
[00:08:44.031 --> 00:08:44.812]  I don't think so.
[00:09:06.826 --> 00:09:14.532]  Now if you want to take our appreciation, that's fine, but I don't think you should have to take that to fulfill a requirement when it has nothing to do with your core interests.
[00:09:14.552 --> 00:09:20.256]  And that's the issue that I have with a lot of these colleges, or pretty much all colleges here in the United States of America.
[00:09:20.636 --> 00:09:25.160]  But now we have this article from CNN, just how much better off are college grads anyway?
[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.082]  Because you always hear the numbers, they're going to make X number of dollars and all that.
[00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:30.684]  Now I'm going to talk about their numbers and I'm going to give you my perspective.
[00:09:31.224 --> 00:09:37.007]  They start off here with the unemployment rate, which for college grads is point, excuse me, 2.5%.
[00:09:37.308 --> 00:09:40.449]  And for high school grads is 5.6%.
[00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.571]  So obviously higher for the high school students.
[00:09:43.031 --> 00:09:44.852]  Also the weekly wages.
[00:09:44.872 --> 00:09:47.554]  They say a college grad, a college grad is going to make
[00:09:48.174 --> 00:09:48.694]  We're good to go.
[00:10:05.973 --> 00:10:06.514]  Sounds good.
[00:10:06.534 --> 00:10:13.119]  It sounds all rosy and cheesy and, you know, it makes you want to give a big hug to your high school guidance counselor.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:21.346]  But the issue that they're leaving out of here, in my personal experience, is number one, how long did it take you to find a job after you got your degree?
[00:10:21.507 --> 00:10:23.909]  Because they always want to tell you the story, they gave me the same spiel.
[00:10:24.369 --> 00:10:26.370]  Back when I was in high school, you know, they bring in some guy.
[00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.190]  Look at, you know, Billy over here.
[00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:29.611]  He's a model and that's all he is.
[00:10:29.651 --> 00:10:34.953]  He is the model of a guy who went to school, you know, he got a job before he even finished his degree.
[00:10:34.973 --> 00:10:38.094]  You know, he got all the scholarships and all that stuff and everything is great for him.
[00:10:38.694 --> 00:10:40.295]  That doesn't happen for most people.
[00:10:40.595 --> 00:10:41.675]  I'm trying to tell you right now.
[00:10:41.695 --> 00:10:42.336]  I went to college.
[00:10:42.376 --> 00:10:43.056]  I understand.
[00:10:43.616 --> 00:10:46.977]  While Billy may be a success story, that doesn't happen for everybody.
[00:10:46.997 --> 00:10:53.039]  It's kind of like watching an ESPN documentary about the guy who overcame all the odds, Kurt Warner.
[00:10:53.339 --> 00:10:56.460]  He went through all the stuff, he made it to the NFL, I believe won a Super Bowl.
[00:10:57.281 --> 00:11:00.642]  And that's kind of what they bring in when they bring in Billy to your classroom.
[00:11:00.682 --> 00:11:02.662]  He is the model, not the norm.
[00:11:04.423 --> 00:11:11.027]  The employment that you do get, is it a temporary job or is it some type of full-time job?
[00:11:11.047 --> 00:11:12.427]  Do you have a nine-to-five?
[00:11:12.487 --> 00:11:14.969]  Are you doing freelance work trying to make your ends meet?
[00:11:15.009 --> 00:11:16.349]  I think that's something very important.
[00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.891]  And also, your student loan situation.
[00:11:19.211 --> 00:11:20.792]  Because once again, they'll bring in Billy.
[00:11:20.812 --> 00:11:22.253]  You know, look at Billy, he has a great job.
[00:11:22.313 --> 00:11:25.274]  My question is, how much student loan debt does that guy have?
[00:11:25.534 --> 00:11:27.696]  Did he go to community college and save some money?
[00:11:27.756 --> 00:11:29.196]  Did he go to the big state school?
[00:11:29.497 --> 00:11:32.558]  Is he going to be paying back those student loans for the rest of his life?
[00:11:32.578 --> 00:11:33.779]  They don't ever want to talk about that.
[00:11:34.139 --> 00:11:42.681]  And I make a lot of, you know, college-waving people very uncomfortable when I talk about student loans, because that's kind of like the iffy thing you can't touch.
[00:11:42.721 --> 00:12:01.284]  And, you know, I don't ask people how much money they have in the bank, but if you're trying to convince some young, impressionable student to go spend, you know, $30,000-plus at a university, I think it is a relevant question to ask that person who's been out of school for 10, 20, 30 years how much student loan debt they are still paying back.
[00:12:01.784 --> 00:12:03.606]  And how much did they have when they started?
[00:12:04.047 --> 00:12:10.373]  And they were getting in my business like, well, if I go to school and follow your plan, isn't it going to become my personal business?
[00:12:10.654 --> 00:12:11.955]  How much student loan did I have?
[00:12:11.975 --> 00:12:13.497]  So I think that is a relevant question.
[00:12:13.777 --> 00:12:15.098]  They don't ever want to talk about that.
[00:12:15.158 --> 00:12:20.865]  So for me to you, if you're young or even if you're an older person and you're thinking about going to school,
[00:12:21.505 --> 00:12:23.766]  I would just flat out ask them, how much student loan debt do you have?
[00:12:24.067 --> 00:12:25.868]  How long do you think it's going to take me to pay it back?
[00:12:26.368 --> 00:12:27.989]  At what rate am I going to be paying this back?
[00:12:28.009 --> 00:12:29.810]  Because they're going to tell you, okay, you're going to get out of school.
[00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:31.791]  You're going to make $80,000 a year.
[00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:32.751]  I'm making up some number.
[00:12:33.032 --> 00:12:34.772]  You'll be able to pay it back in X number of years.
[00:12:34.873 --> 00:12:36.894]  And you have to sit back and wonder, okay.
[00:12:37.654 --> 00:12:40.976]  Am I going to be able to get a job as soon as I walk out of a classroom?
[00:12:41.716 --> 00:12:45.918]  Even if I do get a job, is it going to be the job I want in my field?
[00:12:46.198 --> 00:12:49.260]  If it is the job in the field that I want, am I really going to make $80,000 a year?
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.522]  These are the things that you have to think of for yourself.
[00:12:52.562 --> 00:12:56.424]  They're not going to tell you this because after you're done, it's going to be on to the next one.
[00:12:56.444 --> 00:13:00.466]  And they got thousands, millions of them coming in to fill your spot.
[00:13:00.526 --> 00:13:02.387]  So you have to take this up for yourself.
[00:13:03.385 --> 00:13:07.226]  Now, something that Iran is taking up for themselves very seriously.
[00:13:07.246 --> 00:13:08.747]  This is the Strait of Hormuz.
[00:13:09.147 --> 00:13:11.247]  We see that Iran threatens to block U.S.
[00:13:11.407 --> 00:13:12.928]  access to vital waterway.
[00:13:13.348 --> 00:13:17.529]  And this is the deputy commander of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard.
[00:13:17.929 --> 00:13:25.752]  He said Iranian forces will close the strategic Strait of Hormuz to the United States and its allies if they threaten the Islamic Republic.
[00:13:26.272 --> 00:13:35.519]  Iranian state media reported on Wednesday in the Strait of Hormuz is where they bring in a lot of the oil, nearly a third of the oil that is traded by sea goes through there.
[00:13:35.959 --> 00:13:46.066]  And a general was quoted as saying, Americans should learn from recent historical truths, likely referring to the January capture of 10 US sailors who entered Iranian waters.
[00:13:46.086 --> 00:13:49.569]  And you guys probably remember that it's the scene of the guys and the down on their knees.
[00:13:50.089 --> 00:14:00.641]  Hands on the head that made a lot of people uncomfortable but at the same time if I was in that position I can't say I'd jump up Rambo style and whoop all these guys or I'm not passing any judgment onto them but it's a very serious issue.
[00:14:00.661 --> 00:14:10.432]  You can debate whether Iran is right in the situation if you're a United States citizen you're probably gonna say they're very wrong in it but I think this is a more
[00:14:11.727 --> 00:14:18.130]  Straightforward deals on what we see in places like Syria and Libya, where United States forces have very clearly been in the wrong.
[00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:22.732]  This is more of a murky type of situation, but you can all judge it for yourself.
[00:14:23.332 --> 00:14:28.815]  Now, something I think is very black and white as far as who is wrong is when you talk about El Chapo.
[00:14:29.315 --> 00:14:30.756]  And they'll say El Chapo did this.
[00:14:30.836 --> 00:14:36.600]  He, you know, he captured this many people and he kidnapped this many people and he ran, you know, so many tons of drugs.
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.121]  And yeah, the guy did all that.
[00:14:38.241 --> 00:14:41.163]  But who allowed this guy to do these things?
[00:14:41.323 --> 00:14:43.024]  I referenced the movie Sicario.
[00:14:43.044 --> 00:14:47.627]  If you guys haven't seen, I definitely recommend you do see it if you want to learn more about the war on drugs.
[00:14:47.707 --> 00:14:52.671]  And it is a fictional story, but it references real events and happenings in the world.
[00:14:52.971 --> 00:14:58.975]  Basically, the spoiler, spoiler alert, the United States government is going into Mexico
[00:15:00.236 --> 00:15:00.856]  We're good to go.
[00:15:18.004 --> 00:15:27.794]  And it says in the last decade, the Sinaloa cartel owned the largest fleet of airplanes in Mexico with 599 that were seized between 2006 and 2015.
[00:15:28.174 --> 00:15:32.479]  By comparison, Air Mexico, the country's flag carrier, operates just 127.
[00:15:34.801 --> 00:15:42.606]  And you may be thinking, these are small Cessnas, and yes, many of them were, but they also had Rockwells, Gulfstreams, Pipers, Beechcraft.
[00:15:43.006 --> 00:15:46.348]  It also says that in a secret testimony filed in the U.S.
[00:15:46.388 --> 00:15:54.132]  District Court in Chicago in 2014, revealed that Guzman, El Chapo, also owned a personal fleet of Boeing 747 jets.
[00:15:54.152 --> 00:15:56.493]  Those are pretty big if you ask me.
[00:15:56.714 --> 00:15:58.575]  Also speedboats, submarines.
[00:15:59.015 --> 00:16:00.496]  I mean, that's some next level stuff.
[00:16:01.136 --> 00:16:02.857]  Tractor trailers and freight trains.
[00:16:02.937 --> 00:16:08.459]  So next time you see those rap videos of riding around in their rented Bentleys and all that stuff, that's one thing.
[00:16:08.499 --> 00:16:13.000]  But to own a submarine and a train, that's next level stuff.
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.221]  And who allowed El Chapo to do this?
[00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:18.722]  Oh, of course, the United States government, because they've given him 50 cows and the rest of it.
[00:16:18.742 --> 00:16:20.363]  You can see those articles on CBS.
[00:16:20.663 --> 00:16:23.484]  CBS has done a really good job reporting on El Chapo.
[00:16:23.504 --> 00:16:24.824]  I think they even talked to him.
[00:16:24.864 --> 00:16:26.205]  And yeah, they did talk to him in prison.
[00:16:26.265 --> 00:16:28.986]  They found out how he dug out all the cells and all this stuff.
[00:16:29.486 --> 00:16:42.679]  Now I'm going to end tonight with an inconvenient lie, and that's exactly what it has been, because people will accuse us here at InfoWars.com of fear porn, you're trying to scare people, you're doing all this other stuff with your predictions and all this stuff that doesn't come true.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.003]  I want you guys to look at this clip from Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth.
[00:16:47.023 --> 00:16:47.844]  This is just a trailer.
[00:16:48.104 --> 00:16:49.746]  Then we're going to talk about some of his predictions.
[00:16:50.066 --> 00:16:50.707]  Let's take a look.
[00:16:51.752 --> 00:16:55.233]  This is Patagonia, 75 years ago and the same glacier today.
[00:16:55.893 --> 00:16:59.434]  This is Mount Kilimanjaro, 30 years ago and last year.
[00:17:00.035 --> 00:17:03.696]  Within the decade, there will be no more snows of Kilimanjaro.
[00:17:04.316 --> 00:17:08.977]  This is really not a political issue so much as a moral issue.
[00:17:09.398 --> 00:17:14.679]  Temperature increases are taking place all over the world and that's causing stronger storms.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.061]  This is the biggest crisis in the history of this country.
[00:17:21.394 --> 00:17:24.877]  Now once again they'll say, you guys are climate deniers, you're fear porters and all this stuff.
[00:17:25.918 --> 00:17:28.440]  Just think about the Inconvenient Truth movie.
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:34.125]  Al Gore is saying that by now California and Florida would be covered in water, polar bears can't swim, all this stuff.
[00:17:34.445 --> 00:17:38.229]  And I have this list here from The Daily Caller that talks about a few of his predictions.
[00:17:38.729 --> 00:17:41.190]  Number one, Kilimanjaro still has snow on it.
[00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:47.493]  They say, yes, it's been a decade since Al Gore made his movie and Kilimanjaro still has snow on it year round.
[00:17:47.894 --> 00:18:00.320]  Also, Al Gore left out the 15 year hiatus in warming, saying that Gore's movie released right in the middle of the so-called global warming hiatus, saying, oh yeah, we kind of left out a while in there.
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.481]  Also, the North Pole still has ice.
[00:18:02.541 --> 00:18:03.121]  Very notable.
[00:18:03.221 --> 00:18:04.361]  Anybody can look at that.
[00:18:04.381 --> 00:18:05.582]  You don't have to be a scientist to see it.
[00:18:05.882 --> 00:18:10.424]  And also, the day-after-tomorrow style ice age is still a day away.
[00:18:10.504 --> 00:18:16.306]  Not to mention that Al Gore has multiple homes, some on the sea, with a $30,000 electricity bill.
[00:18:16.546 --> 00:18:17.747]  So how green is it?
[00:18:17.767 --> 00:18:20.348]  So I guess, Al, it's not too easy being green.
[00:18:20.708 --> 00:18:22.869]  Stay tuned right after this break for more special reports.
[00:18:23.149 --> 00:18:26.150]  I'm Jakari Jackson, right here from the InfoWars Command Center.
[00:18:44.534 --> 00:18:47.096]  This is an American President.
[00:18:47.436 --> 00:18:51.298]  Just add puppet, then vote and repeat every four years.
[00:19:04.907 --> 00:19:09.310]  There's a very important question that needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.451 --> 00:19:12.072]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.769 --> 00:19:15.769]  And to look at that threat, we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:27.192]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type one civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.852 --> 00:19:39.214]  You can say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.742 --> 00:19:50.145]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.345]  We're good to go.
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.386]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:31.934]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.418]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:46.732]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:47.934]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.454 --> 00:20:53.499]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription.
[00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:10.395]  Not just that chips are going to be on the pills and medicines themselves, but now you're going to have to give your blood, basically every time, a tiny prick, into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on in your body as well as your genes.
[00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.878]  In this short report we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.991]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:23.995]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Meet Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.934]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:04.097]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:17.542]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:19.763]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:21.424]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:30.126]  We do have that magic spark, but the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:46.631]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in BrainForce, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.
[00:22:47.091 --> 00:22:53.816]  Check out Brain Force today and other game-changing compounds like X2, Survival Shield, at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:54.136 --> 00:22:56.517]  Again, that's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:23:08.103 --> 00:23:19.355]  I'm not going to get into this investigative journalist or author, researcher, but he's worked as an investigator for some of the biggest publications and TV stations and networks out there.
[00:23:20.236 --> 00:23:21.437]  And he's just really a smart guy.
[00:23:21.457 --> 00:23:25.701]  We always like getting his commentary, not just here on my show, but on the nightly news as well.
[00:23:25.741 --> 00:23:26.802]  NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[00:23:28.018 --> 00:23:32.419]  A lot of his great books there on philosophy, history, research, the media.
[00:23:32.859 --> 00:23:34.259]  A very, very thought-provoking fellow.
[00:23:34.839 --> 00:23:36.880]  I wanted to get him on about the general state of the world.
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:41.781]  Also, an article he wrote about where TPP and the globalist takeover is going right now.
[00:23:41.821 --> 00:23:47.182]  And just cover a smattering of the waterfront and, of course, take your calls.
[00:23:47.222 --> 00:23:48.102]  But John, wow.
[00:23:48.622 --> 00:23:50.083]  What do you make of Trump?
[00:23:50.123 --> 00:23:51.823]  I mean, I don't know what your answer is going to be.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:24:04.104]  Clearly, regardless of who he is, we're seeing a collapse of the credibility of the system, way beyond what you wrote about with my Piers Morgan appearance.
[00:24:04.504 --> 00:24:05.965]  This just seems to be cascading.
[00:24:06.265 --> 00:24:07.325]  Where does it go from here?
[00:24:07.445 --> 00:24:10.246]  And what are the elite going to do to try to maintain control?
[00:24:10.626 --> 00:24:11.486]  Or do you disagree?
[00:24:11.526 --> 00:24:12.707]  There hasn't been a collapse.
[00:24:14.107 --> 00:24:18.609]  No, there's a collapse, all right, Alex, because of what he's saying.
[00:24:19.292 --> 00:24:20.392]  You know, it's really simple.
[00:24:20.752 --> 00:24:24.633]  You can hate him, you can say he's a fake, he's a phony, he's this or that and so forth.
[00:24:25.374 --> 00:24:32.755]  But when the guy gets up and gives a foreign policy speech and says, we need to end globalism, for example.
[00:24:33.256 --> 00:24:41.097]  We need to cancel these trade treaties, these giant treaties that are sucking life and money and jobs out of America.
[00:24:42.098 --> 00:24:46.879]  He's talking common sense that the media have refused to discuss.
[00:24:48.015 --> 00:24:50.516]  For 20, 30 years or more.
[00:24:51.096 --> 00:24:52.117]  And now there it is.
[00:24:52.757 --> 00:24:56.278]  So if you don't like the guy, if you hate him, look at the words.
[00:24:56.678 --> 00:24:57.719]  Forget who's saying them.
[00:24:58.479 --> 00:24:59.980]  Look at the other side of the coin.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.241]  I mean, really, the other side of the coin.
[00:25:02.541 --> 00:25:07.383]  Who's the other guy who's talking about these trade deals and globalism all throughout the campaign?
[00:25:07.423 --> 00:25:08.223]  Bernie Sanders.
[00:25:09.163 --> 00:25:13.725]  Put together the voting bloc of Sanders plus Trump.
[00:25:15.037 --> 00:25:22.465]  Because a lot of that voting block has to do with defeating globalism and cancelling these trade treaties.
[00:25:22.946 --> 00:25:25.849]  Look at the size of that voting block versus
[00:25:26.681 --> 00:25:37.146]  The witch who's riding down the center stripe on her blood-soaked hands, Hillary Clinton, who is a globalist to the core, and you realize the divide-and-conquer strategy here.
[00:25:37.547 --> 00:25:39.087]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:25:39.488 --> 00:25:55.596]  Let's take the people in the United States, all of whom know that this is a complete farce, a crime, a tragedy, the destruction of the country, as we move into the globalist framework for the world order of the future.
[00:25:56.522 --> 00:26:01.624]  Let's just forget all about that, but let's divide and conquer these people.
[00:26:01.884 --> 00:26:10.686]  Let's put them on opposite sides, where they're screaming at each other over the fence, so that Hillary just rides down the middle and wins.
[00:26:11.086 --> 00:26:12.047]  Well, that's what's happening.
[00:26:12.067 --> 00:26:12.727]  That's what's going to happen.
[00:26:12.747 --> 00:26:13.167]  That's a great point.
[00:26:13.187 --> 00:26:14.687]  Do you think Trump understands that?
[00:26:14.967 --> 00:26:16.888]  At your gut level, do you think the fix is in?
[00:26:18.668 --> 00:26:20.429]  No, I think he understands this very well.
[00:26:21.109 --> 00:26:23.812]  The question is, does Bernie Sanders understand it?
[00:26:24.232 --> 00:26:27.115]  And I think in his heart of hearts alone at night, he does.
[00:26:27.596 --> 00:26:31.019]  He's looking at Trump and scratching his head and saying, I hate this guy.
[00:26:31.279 --> 00:26:33.581]  He's everything that I don't want to be.
[00:26:33.882 --> 00:26:36.504]  He's everything that shouldn't happen to America.
[00:26:37.665 --> 00:26:46.348]  You know, I have to admit, on the issue of the trade treaties and globalism, I mean, we both know pretty much the same data, and we're on the same side.
[00:26:46.548 --> 00:26:49.409]  Yeah, if Sanders has credibility, he's gotta go with Trump, but he's not.
[00:26:49.429 --> 00:26:58.872]  He says he'll pledge to Hillary, who's got more corrupt Wall Street money, more dirty, crony-capitalist war money, than anybody ever in history.
[00:26:58.912 --> 00:27:00.792]  I mean, she is disgusting.
[00:27:01.173 --> 00:27:05.094]  But how epic is it, as you just said, John Rappaport, of nomorefakenews.com,
[00:27:05.999 --> 00:27:11.221]  That Trump's saying, cancel globalism, up with sovereignty, up with basic things.
[00:27:11.241 --> 00:27:12.942]  That is so anathema to the enemy.
[00:27:13.402 --> 00:27:17.904]  There's no way they can be behind him because he's bringing back nationalism and framing the debate.
[00:27:18.304 --> 00:27:20.084]  England's trying to get out of the EU.
[00:27:20.484 --> 00:27:21.585]  The narrative's changing.
[00:27:21.645 --> 00:27:22.905]  World government's in trouble.
[00:27:23.185 --> 00:27:25.506]  The plan isn't going according to plan.
[00:27:25.526 --> 00:27:26.267]  They're in trouble.
[00:27:27.187 --> 00:27:27.747]  Big trouble.
[00:27:28.127 --> 00:27:32.949]  You know, Obama has to go over there to England and say to the Britain, UK,
[00:27:35.808 --> 00:27:37.309]  To the leaders, to the people.
[00:27:38.049 --> 00:27:53.456]  If you don't stay in the European Union, meaning globalism, because that's what it's all about, if you get out, you have to go to the back of the line to negotiate a separate trade treaty with the United States.
[00:27:53.596 --> 00:27:56.917]  Well, you know, that tells you who Obama is.
[00:27:57.537 --> 00:28:02.419]  And the UK should call that bluff in a minute, just like we should when the Communist Chinese tell us what to do!
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:03.460]  Exactly!
[00:28:04.144 --> 00:28:06.265]  You know, say, well, what are you talking about?
[00:28:06.405 --> 00:28:14.049]  You're talking about defeating everything that needs to be defeating, and you're saying, no, we should join up with the insanity.
[00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:15.690]  So, please leave.
[00:28:15.911 --> 00:28:16.291]  Get out.
[00:28:16.451 --> 00:28:20.033]  You have such a way of crystallizing the battlefront and what we're really seeing.
[00:28:20.153 --> 00:28:32.600]  John, how profound is it that they're so arrogant now, they tell us, the TPP's written, it merges all these unions together, it's above the law, we get copies finally, they pass it, just totally draconian, but still,
[00:28:34.142 --> 00:28:37.344]  Nothing is really being said about it in mainstream media.
[00:28:37.384 --> 00:28:44.647]  But meanwhile, they get arrogant and say, hey, we don't even have to have elections anymore.
[00:28:44.687 --> 00:28:45.427]  Those never counted.
[00:28:45.447 --> 00:28:46.748]  We just appoint the people now.
[00:28:47.068 --> 00:28:48.028]  But that backfired.
[00:28:48.068 --> 00:28:48.749]  That didn't work.
[00:28:48.809 --> 00:28:51.690]  It shows they can only go so far.
[00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:54.911]  And I think they've tried to go too far, and it's really backfiring.
[00:28:54.931 --> 00:28:58.053]  Your comment on what he was saying and on that, please, Mr. Rappaport.
[00:28:58.743 --> 00:28:59.343]  Absolutely.
[00:28:59.383 --> 00:29:02.584]  As he says, it's been going on for a very long time.
[00:29:03.104 --> 00:29:11.127]  The first great trade treaty, GATT, after the Second World War, they started negotiating that in 1945.
[00:29:12.087 --> 00:29:14.508]  So this goes back a long way, the plan.
[00:29:15.288 --> 00:29:20.710]  And the plan is to empower these megacorporations to decide the law.
[00:29:21.531 --> 00:29:23.293]  For whatever country they're in.
[00:29:23.313 --> 00:29:35.324]  I mean, people have to understand that these trade treaties, as they're called, TPP, TTIP, this is all about saying, look, the judicial system of countries is extinct.
[00:29:35.744 --> 00:29:36.985]  We don't need this anymore.
[00:29:37.446 --> 00:29:40.128]  What we're going to have instead is corporate tribunals.
[00:29:40.869 --> 00:29:47.195]  And this is all about a corporation saying, look, we've got all this stuff that we want to sell all over the world.
[00:29:47.956 --> 00:29:58.084]  And we don't care whether you think it's toxic, destructive, you know, pesticides and toxic medical drugs, GMOs, tainted food, etc, etc.
[00:29:58.104 --> 00:29:58.985]  We're going to sell it.
[00:29:59.585 --> 00:30:05.710]  And if any country refuses it, then we're going to sue that government in a corporate tribunal.
[00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:09.513]  The judicial system of that country will have nothing to say about it.
[00:30:09.933 --> 00:30:12.295]  And hey, listen, there's an interesting story today.
[00:30:13.075 --> 00:30:14.777]  The NFL has told
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:19.383]  They're players not to eat meat from Mexico.
[00:30:19.523 --> 00:30:20.643]  But citizens can!
[00:30:20.964 --> 00:30:24.106]  They're shipping it in, record numbers, full of steroids and drugs.
[00:30:24.806 --> 00:30:25.827]  That's a powerful article.
[00:30:25.847 --> 00:30:26.988]  That's in the LA Times and others.
[00:30:27.008 --> 00:30:27.428]  Talk about it.
[00:30:28.325 --> 00:30:32.746]  Yeah, because the players could test positive for steroid use and be suspended.
[00:30:33.166 --> 00:30:44.728]  So it's like saying, well, we don't know what's in the food, but we know that some of the food coming from Mexico has got this stuff in it, and if you, an NFL star, eat this meat, then you could test positive for steroids.
[00:30:44.748 --> 00:30:46.009]  But it's okay for your kids.
[00:30:46.169 --> 00:30:46.969]  It's okay for your kids.
[00:30:47.169 --> 00:30:49.429]  Kids, everybody else, it's fine, whatever.
[00:30:50.109 --> 00:30:52.390]  And the reason I bring this up is because
[00:30:53.090 --> 00:31:00.514]  In these trade deals, what's happening is, people will not be able to know what country their food is coming from.
[00:31:00.534 --> 00:31:12.881]  Just like we can't know GMO labeling here, and let's expand, that's one small part of it, but key, they're also diplomatically and corporately immune, and they can also use the regulations to shut down domestic operators.
[00:31:12.961 --> 00:31:15.082]  It's a monopoly takeover system.
[00:31:15.822 --> 00:31:16.423]  Absolutely.
[00:31:16.863 --> 00:31:19.424]  They can say, this is the food for planet Earth.
[00:31:19.985 --> 00:31:20.525]  Deal with it.
[00:31:21.132 --> 00:31:26.935]  You can't resist it because we have these tribunals that will overcome any system you now have.
[00:31:27.495 --> 00:31:34.359]  So it turns to the people to revolt against this completely, just the way they're now revolting against the political system.
[00:31:34.419 --> 00:31:40.602]  I was about to say, it's a microcosm, as above so below, that they would try to go, hey, we have superdelegates that decide now.
[00:31:40.942 --> 00:31:41.603]  That's the way it is.
[00:31:41.663 --> 00:31:43.303]  Go and shut... People said, wait, we vote.
[00:31:43.383 --> 00:31:45.384]  You're... So see, it's backfiring.
[00:31:45.424 --> 00:31:46.105]  That's the good news.
[00:31:46.445 --> 00:31:47.365]  As long as we resist.
[00:31:47.686 --> 00:31:48.446]  Look at the Brexit.
[00:31:48.506 --> 00:31:49.827]  How exciting is that for you?
[00:31:50.589 --> 00:31:51.229]  Fantastic.
[00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:58.272]  You know, nobody in England who isn't a globalist wants to stay in the European Union.
[00:31:58.712 --> 00:32:03.733]  The whole idea is England would leave the European Union and say, gee, guess what?
[00:32:04.494 --> 00:32:05.214]  We're a country.
[00:32:05.494 --> 00:32:06.414]  We forgot about that.
[00:32:06.794 --> 00:32:07.935]  We're our own country.
[00:32:08.295 --> 00:32:09.515]  We can protect ourselves.
[00:32:09.555 --> 00:32:18.638]  We don't need the bureaucrats to make 91% of our laws and open our borders and tell us we can't fly the stars and bars because it's racist or stars and stripes.
[00:32:18.719 --> 00:32:19.999]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[00:32:20.748 --> 00:32:21.568]  Completely crazy.
[00:32:22.028 --> 00:32:39.333]  So I'm just hoping that this movement gains a lot more steam, because there are a lot of people in the US, I can tell your listeners in England, who are rooting for you to get out of the European Union completely, because this will start a domino effect.
[00:32:40.214 --> 00:32:42.756]  Absolutely, they're saying that, it's already happening, and here's the good news.
[00:32:43.117 --> 00:32:47.020]  Thomas Everson said, the level of tyranny you will live under is the exact amount you put up with.
[00:32:47.341 --> 00:32:48.362]  It's equilibrium, folks.
[00:32:49.262 --> 00:32:55.708]  If you put up with tyranny, it'll just push and push and push, till the execs are in your house saying, you know, let me have sex with your wife.
[00:32:56.069 --> 00:32:56.970]  Like, like rollerball.
[00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:58.191]  You know, we own you.
[00:32:58.311 --> 00:32:59.932]  You've got to stand up for yourself.
[00:33:02.375 --> 00:33:04.757]  A lot of people ask me, what is the most important
[00:33:06.286 --> 00:33:06.546]  I think?
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:05.728 --> 00:37:18.493]  Welcome back to our live coverage of the Indiana primary, which has now turned out to be our live coverage of the end of the GOP primaries, because we've had Ted Cruz officially drop out after being shellacked in Indiana.
[00:37:19.073 --> 00:37:20.974]  So we're going to take a look at that.
[00:37:21.094 --> 00:37:28.497]  Before we go on, we were just talking before we went to the break, Rob, about how it's going to be interesting now that the general election is beginning.
[00:37:28.877 --> 00:37:29.117]  Right.
[00:37:30.119 --> 00:37:32.562]  He's going to bring out all of Hillary's skeletons.
[00:37:32.662 --> 00:37:38.991]  And she had a very interesting remark this last week when she came out and started talking about her off-the-reservation remark.
[00:37:39.011 --> 00:37:43.117]  And I want to get Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson to come in on this too.
[00:37:43.437 --> 00:37:44.239]  Here's what she said.
[00:37:46.141 --> 00:37:53.483]  I've had a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave and how they speak.
[00:37:53.543 --> 00:37:59.245]  She says, I'm having trouble with Trump because I can handle men who get off the reservation in their behavior.
[00:37:59.985 --> 00:38:06.147]  And he came back and he said, well, you know, first of all, she's insulted the Indians and they were upset about that.
[00:38:06.187 --> 00:38:09.348]  I think she issued an apology to them, but she didn't issue an apology to men.
[00:38:09.769 --> 00:38:10.749]  And I think she wants to put
[00:38:11.209 --> 00:38:12.110]  Everyone, not just men.
[00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:21.600]  I think she wants to put all of us on a reservation because, you know, the reservations are the original Agenda 21, the original socialist detainment camps.
[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:22.521]  She admitted that in a speech.
[00:38:22.541 --> 00:38:23.522]  She called it fun camps.
[00:38:23.782 --> 00:38:27.486]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[00:38:27.506 --> 00:38:33.312]  And we need the fun camps that you all run.
[00:38:34.807 --> 00:38:34.907]  Yeah.
[00:38:34.947 --> 00:38:35.928]  Adults can go and have fun.
[00:38:35.948 --> 00:38:36.228]  That's right.
[00:38:36.248 --> 00:38:39.671]  That's why we don't have to worry about working, we don't have to worry about bills or taking care of our kids.
[00:38:39.691 --> 00:38:41.253]  You're going to go to the reservation, you're not going to get out.
[00:38:41.273 --> 00:38:42.454]  The state's going to do it for us.
[00:38:42.474 --> 00:38:43.455]  You know, it's a fun camp.
[00:38:43.755 --> 00:38:49.680]  Back at, we had, you talked and you interviewed and you shot the interviews with Russell Means.
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:50.000]  Yeah.
[00:38:50.541 --> 00:38:51.562]  American Indian Movement.
[00:38:52.122 --> 00:38:54.304]  And he wrote a book called, Were White Men Feared to Tread?
[00:38:54.344 --> 00:38:55.385]  It's an amazing book too.
[00:38:55.585 --> 00:38:57.247]  Yeah, he talked about how, he said, look,
[00:38:57.867 --> 00:39:01.210]  The American government has broken every treaty they've ever made with the Indians.
[00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:04.113]  And it goes, now they're breaking the treaty they made with you, white man.
[00:39:04.433 --> 00:39:05.154]  The Constitution.
[00:39:05.174 --> 00:39:06.094]  What are you going to do about it?
[00:39:06.535 --> 00:39:07.836]  Look at the reservation system.
[00:39:07.876 --> 00:39:13.601]  What they did to the Indians on the reservation system is now what they're doing in the cities to everyone.
[00:39:14.022 --> 00:39:16.884]  And it is a system of socialist control.
[00:39:17.425 --> 00:39:20.407]  And she came back and tried to walk these statements back and said, no, no, no.
[00:39:20.567 --> 00:39:23.010]  I was thinking about Rudy Giuliani and Rick Lazio.
[00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:27.315]  And then she goes on to say, people have been dumping stuff on me for 25 years.
[00:39:27.395 --> 00:39:28.998]  I don't think she was talking about Rudy and Rick.
[00:39:29.298 --> 00:39:32.683]  I think people that have been dumping bad behavior on her was Bill.
[00:39:32.963 --> 00:39:35.446]  I think we got that right from the very beginning.
[00:39:35.607 --> 00:39:38.030]  It's passive-aggressive Bill hating.
[00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:38.691]  That's right.
[00:39:39.071 --> 00:39:53.049]  I guess no better person to bring on right now to talk about Hillary and the skeletons that are going to be in her closet when we see this general election kick off is investigative journalist Wayne Madsen from the Wayne Madsen Report, also reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:39:53.429 --> 00:39:56.453]  Wayne, what do you make of the landslide victory today with Donald Trump?
[00:39:57.096 --> 00:40:00.578]  Well, I'm really not too surprised.
[00:40:01.399 --> 00:40:25.033]  I really believe that the reason Trump decided to go for the jugular of Cruz with the father in association with Lee Harvey Oswald is that his internal polls showed him so far ahead, he figured, look, I can just drive him final nail in the coffin of this guy Cruz, and it looks like he did it.
[00:40:25.998 --> 00:40:30.322]  Yeah, absolutely, but I think he, and that's the thing about Donald Trump, I think they underestimate him as a candidate.
[00:40:30.382 --> 00:40:33.705]  He is going to expose everything that Hillary has done, don't you believe?
[00:40:34.145 --> 00:40:35.706]  He's going to go for everything.
[00:40:35.726 --> 00:40:51.720]  Oh yeah, yeah, the guy, you know, the guy, I said a long time ago, I said, you know, the reason why, remember Norman Lear created All in the Family, he was hoping white middle class, especially men, would laugh at the
[00:40:53.101 --> 00:40:58.567]  Archie Bunker character, and then thus they would look at their own families.
[00:40:59.408 --> 00:41:01.811]  He said, I never thought they'd laugh along with him.
[00:41:02.312 --> 00:41:03.092]  That's right.
[00:41:03.233 --> 00:41:07.297]  And they laughed at his model of the guy who was supposed to be reasonable, I guess, Meathead, right?
[00:41:07.457 --> 00:41:07.958]  The son-in-law.
[00:41:07.998 --> 00:41:11.081]  He was supposed to be the one to educate us all, and we were all laughing at him.
[00:41:11.121 --> 00:41:11.902]  It was like, what a dupe.
[00:41:12.603 --> 00:41:13.844]  That's right, that's right.
[00:41:14.204 --> 00:41:29.193]  So what we have here is a case of people in Indiana affiliated themselves with Trump's comments, just as people in Pennsylvania and New York and South Carolina and Florida and every other state he went and did.
[00:41:29.713 --> 00:41:34.636]  And I think, you know, we also, I don't know how it's going to turn out.
[00:41:34.676 --> 00:41:36.417]  Looks like Bernie Sanders may pull up.
[00:41:37.377 --> 00:41:47.141]  People on both sides are frustrated with the political insiders in both parties and we're just seeing a visceral reaction against them.
[00:41:47.721 --> 00:41:58.305]  Wayne, have you heard Greg Gutfeld laughing about the JFK story and saying that Donald Trump pivoted towards Alex Jones?
[00:41:58.325 --> 00:41:59.305]  Did you hear that remark?
[00:41:59.724 --> 00:42:03.548]  No, but Greg Gutfeld is an incredibly non-funny person.
[00:42:04.289 --> 00:42:10.675]  I don't know what comedy clubs he appears at, but I would never pay for a ticket to listen to the guy.
[00:42:10.695 --> 00:42:12.557]  Is he a legitimate comedian?
[00:42:12.677 --> 00:42:13.418]  I don't watch him.
[00:42:13.438 --> 00:42:15.060]  Is he really supposed to be a comedian?
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:19.044]  He's supposed to be a comedian, but when you're a comedian you're supposed to be funny.
[00:42:19.644 --> 00:42:26.589]  Imagine if Hillary Clinton claimed that Bernie Sanders had a role in the killing of Bobby Kennedy.
[00:42:27.169 --> 00:42:29.831]  We would be going crazy right now.
[00:42:29.851 --> 00:42:32.053]  We'd be going wall to wall.
[00:42:32.373 --> 00:42:32.993]  But no!
[00:42:33.354 --> 00:42:35.195]  Are we about to...
[00:42:36.676 --> 00:42:43.261]  I mean, is this the pivot we've been talking about?
[00:42:43.481 --> 00:42:46.803]  He's not pivoting for presidential, he's pivoting to Alex Jones!
[00:42:46.823 --> 00:42:48.164]  He's pivoting to crazy!
[00:42:48.705 --> 00:42:59.953]  And he's not funny, he's just an arrogant... well, I have some words I could use, I won't, but, you know, I mean, the guy, you know, first of all, what's he doing on a political roundtable program?
[00:43:01.994 --> 00:43:04.696]  You know, he doesn't have any credentials to talk about anything.
[00:43:05.036 --> 00:43:05.936]  He's not a journalist.
[00:43:06.036 --> 00:43:07.397]  He doesn't do any investigation.
[00:43:07.677 --> 00:43:09.698]  He has a superficial knowledge of what's going on.
[00:43:09.938 --> 00:43:18.603]  And so these other guys, I mean, it was just a, it was what, about a month or so ago that they were laughing, National Review and the rest of these people were laughing about the 28 pages.
[00:43:18.623 --> 00:43:19.944]  They didn't even know what that was.
[00:43:20.084 --> 00:43:20.404]  Okay.
[00:43:20.644 --> 00:43:23.946]  And so they were saying, hey, Donald Trump turned into an Alex Jones caller.
[00:43:23.966 --> 00:43:25.186]  Now we're hearing the same thing from this.
[00:43:25.246 --> 00:43:28.168]  And when he brought the subject up, the people on the panel were going, what?
[00:43:28.428 --> 00:43:31.649]  I don't know what that is, a JFK assassination?
[00:43:31.669 --> 00:43:39.373]  Maybe they need to have Gilbert Gottfried join Greg Gutfeld on that show on Fox.
[00:43:40.093 --> 00:43:42.214]  They can just bore people with their bad humor.
[00:43:42.494 --> 00:43:43.115]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:43.195 --> 00:43:52.319]  Well, they ought to do a little bit of investigation if they're going to get on a show and talk about things, but I guess we don't have to have journalists anymore to have a talk show.
[00:43:52.579 --> 00:43:53.979]  They don't have to do any investigation.
[00:43:53.999 --> 00:43:55.240]  You set the bar pretty low, I guess.
[00:43:56.223 --> 00:43:56.843]  Well, that's true.
[00:43:57.063 --> 00:44:03.485]  You know, the White House Correspondents Dinner used to be all journalists and their sources, and now half the people that show up are from Hollywood.
[00:44:03.906 --> 00:44:05.986]  I mean, they don't add anything to the occasion.
[00:44:06.006 --> 00:44:07.747]  I don't know why they're there.
[00:44:09.407 --> 00:44:16.250]  But, you know, that's the way the Washington Press Corps wants it, the White House Press Corps.
[00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:22.172]  And so they've got this sort of vapid annual event where
[00:44:23.232 --> 00:44:35.275]  They get some comic, like in this case, Larry Wilmore, who really, I think, was despicable for using a term, whether you like Obama or don't like him.
[00:44:35.835 --> 00:44:39.155]  I don't think that word had any place at that White House Correspondents Dinner.
[00:44:39.756 --> 00:44:42.716]  Well, yeah, they used to say politics is show business for ugly people.
[00:44:42.736 --> 00:44:46.037]  I guess it's show business for people who aren't even remotely entertaining anymore, right?
[00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:47.231]  Exactly.
[00:44:47.291 --> 00:44:51.455]  Well, they call the White House Correspondents Dinner the Nerd Prom for a reason.
[00:44:53.037 --> 00:44:55.500]  Now I just think it's not what it was.
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:45:02.808]  I know people who went to these events many, many years ago when they were strictly a journalist event.
[00:45:02.888 --> 00:45:05.551]  Either journalists were trying to curry favor with a source,
[00:45:06.592 --> 00:45:13.117]  Uh, that they hope to get information from, or they did it to thank a source who had already given them some information.
[00:45:13.157 --> 00:45:17.199]  So it was, it was that type of, uh, uh, event, but no longer.
[00:45:17.279 --> 00:45:22.843]  It's now, uh, almost like it's the Oscar, uh, uh, the Emmy, uh, Emmy or Oscar awards.
[00:45:23.183 --> 00:45:32.748]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[00:45:33.208 --> 00:45:34.929]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.670]  Think about it.
[00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:41.653]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[00:45:41.913 --> 00:45:47.476]  But on the other hand, the Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:45:47.856 --> 00:45:59.625]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[00:45:59.885 --> 00:46:02.667]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[00:46:02.868 --> 00:46:05.329]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:10.113]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[00:46:10.533 --> 00:46:11.094]  Think about it.
[00:46:11.314 --> 00:46:22.499]  This is Darren McBreen and I want you to break the matrix at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and listen to the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on in your mind.
[00:46:31.482 --> 00:46:33.042]  And all you ISIS people threatening us?
[00:46:33.302 --> 00:46:34.763]  Hey, we're not a French newspaper.
[00:46:35.203 --> 00:46:35.463]  Okay?
[00:46:35.763 --> 00:46:38.624]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[00:46:38.824 --> 00:46:40.524]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[00:46:40.544 --> 00:46:41.824]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[00:46:42.185 --> 00:46:42.905]  This is Texas.
[00:46:43.125 --> 00:46:43.945]  You wanna threaten me?
[00:46:44.005 --> 00:46:45.105]  You can go straight to hell.
[00:46:45.145 --> 00:46:45.785]  You understand that?
[00:46:45.945 --> 00:46:51.667]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 Proof.
[00:46:52.127 --> 00:46:55.968]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.

[00:47:07.602 --> 00:47:09.783]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.903 --> 00:47:16.706]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:16.946 --> 00:47:20.207]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.227 --> 00:47:21.408]  You're going to crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.991]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.

[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:35.299 --> 00:48:37.600]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:49:08.314 --> 00:49:13.037]  As the election cycle starts to heat up, we see a lot of violence perpetrated at political rallies.
[00:49:13.097 --> 00:49:17.620]  In particular, Donald Trump rallies by people who aren't even Donald Trump supporters.
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:22.583]  So we're going to come out here and ask the people if Donald Trump should suspend his campaign in lieu of violence.
[00:49:26.886 --> 00:49:35.772]  Hey, how you doing today folks?
[00:49:36.516 --> 00:49:39.118]  We're asking people their views on the 2016 election.
[00:49:39.178 --> 00:49:40.340]  Do you have a favorite candidate?
[00:49:42.341 --> 00:49:43.262]  No, I don't know.
[00:49:43.462 --> 00:49:45.004]  I don't know enough about it right now.
[00:49:45.284 --> 00:49:45.845]  That's fair enough.
[00:49:46.205 --> 00:49:46.665]  Sorry.
[00:49:46.886 --> 00:49:48.687]  I'll just tell you one quick thing and get your comment.
[00:49:48.907 --> 00:49:52.771]  Okay, so the Donald Trump rallies are having a lot of violence take place at them.
[00:49:52.791 --> 00:49:55.033]  You know, people trying to flip over cop cars and all that.
[00:49:55.353 --> 00:50:00.298]  Do you think that Donald Trump should stop his rallies because of the violence that happens at those protests?
[00:50:01.656 --> 00:50:02.517]  Yes, maybe.
[00:50:02.577 --> 00:50:03.077]  Yeah.
[00:50:04.178 --> 00:50:06.020]  I think so.
[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:06.700]  John?
[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:06.980]  No.
[00:50:07.781 --> 00:50:10.743]  He shouldn't have to stop his rallies.
[00:50:11.684 --> 00:50:14.106]  Unfortunately, that happens often.
[00:50:14.707 --> 00:50:15.848]  That's a problem.
[00:50:16.028 --> 00:50:20.511]  But he's not causing it, and so he shouldn't be responsible for stopping it.
[00:50:21.132 --> 00:50:22.413]  What are your views of Donald Trump?
[00:50:22.453 --> 00:50:23.754]  Better than Hillary!
[00:50:24.214 --> 00:50:26.316]  We're talking to people about the 2016 election.
[00:50:26.336 --> 00:50:27.577]  Do you have a favorite candidate?
[00:50:27.597 --> 00:50:29.579]  Clinton.
[00:50:30.459 --> 00:50:30.940]  Clinton?
[00:50:31.343 --> 00:50:32.584]  What's your favorite view about Clinton?
[00:50:32.784 --> 00:50:33.624]  Anything in particular?
[00:50:35.185 --> 00:50:45.009]  You know, she wasn't my favorite starting out, but she's the frontrunner for Democrat and I will go with the Democrat because they have most of the values that I have.
[00:50:46.049 --> 00:50:52.011]  On the Republican side, one of the hot issues is a lot of the violence that's happening at Trump rallies, anti-Trump rallies.
[00:50:52.352 --> 00:50:55.533]  Do you think that they should suspend Trump's rallies because of the violence there?
[00:50:57.194 --> 00:50:57.394]  No.
[00:50:57.594 --> 00:50:58.574]  Yeah, I'm going to vote for Hillary.
[00:50:59.475 --> 00:51:00.315]  Any particular reason?
[00:51:01.331 --> 00:51:02.932]  Well, I think she's got the most experience.
[00:51:03.753 --> 00:51:08.297]  I actually like what Bernie Sanders has to say in terms of his positions.
[00:51:08.357 --> 00:51:14.322]  I think he's a really progressive and very knowledgeable guy for what would be best for the country.
[00:51:14.402 --> 00:51:20.767]  But I think Hillary has more experience and will probably be able to implement what needs to be done to move us forward.
[00:51:21.228 --> 00:51:24.691]  Do you think that Donald Trump should suspend his rallies in lieu of all the violence?
[00:51:25.981 --> 00:51:46.649]  You know what I really think is people should stop being violent at his rallies because I don't think I think it's it's counterproductive actually I think Trump's such a fool that if people you know just behave themselves and demonstrate peaceably it would probably be the best possible thing to do to discredit him more but if people are violent then they feed right into his BS rhetoric unfortunately.
[00:51:55.885 --> 00:51:56.946]  I'm supporting Hillary Clinton.
[00:51:57.686 --> 00:51:58.547]  Any particular reason?
[00:51:59.147 --> 00:52:10.894]  I've been following her since Bill Clinton was elected president in 1992, and she has stood up for just about everything that I care about since that time, and I think that she's absolutely the most qualified candidate.
[00:52:12.075 --> 00:52:17.198]  A similar question, we talk about the political rallies, there's a lot of violence going on there, especially the Donald Trump rallies.
[00:52:17.218 --> 00:52:20.940]  Do you think maybe Donald Trump should suspend his rallies in lieu of violence?
[00:52:21.624 --> 00:52:26.647]  I think Donald Trump should suspend his rhetoric that is inciting people to be this violent.
[00:52:26.947 --> 00:52:28.848]  Do you have a favorite presidential candidate?
[00:52:29.708 --> 00:52:30.729]  Probably Bernie Sanders.
[00:52:31.909 --> 00:52:35.431]  I don't know enough to make an informed opinion, but I guess Bernie Sanders.
[00:52:36.051 --> 00:52:39.573]  Now Bernie is a self-described democratic socialist.
[00:52:39.713 --> 00:52:40.754]  Does that concern you at all?
[00:52:42.155 --> 00:52:46.117]  Honestly, not too much because I don't feel like he's
[00:52:47.208 --> 00:52:52.990]  And particularly, like, wanting to change the whole thing into a socialist, like, reform of a country.
[00:52:53.010 --> 00:52:56.071]  Socialist is just a big word for caring about the people, honestly.
[00:52:56.091 --> 00:53:02.653]  It's supposed to be scary because we give it negative connotations from past experiences, but there's nothing bad with being a socialist, you know?
[00:53:02.874 --> 00:53:06.275]  Do you think Donald Trump should suspend his political rallies in lieu of violence?
[00:53:09.556 --> 00:53:12.277]  As much as I want to say yes, I kind of feel like
[00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:18.734]  If he did that, then we'd still be like stepping on his rights and stuff.
[00:53:45.732 --> 00:53:56.101]  It's really important for us to remember our history.
[00:53:58.463 --> 00:54:03.667]  You know, unless you're one of the first Americans, a Native American, you came from someplace else.
[00:54:04.588 --> 00:54:06.790]  Somebody brought you here.
[00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:11.594]  Betrayed that reservation, the value of that reservation, and the value of its people.
[00:54:12.995 --> 00:54:25.822]  The value of its air, the value of its carbon emissions are traded on Wall Street, through Dun & Bradstreet.
[00:54:26.422 --> 00:54:27.003]  It's listed.
[00:54:28.163 --> 00:54:37.588]  So we haven't even hit on all the swindles that Wall Street is visiting upon the people of America.
[00:54:37.988 --> 00:54:40.590]  You're nothing but a bunch of
[00:54:43.055 --> 00:54:47.557]  Coupons for the United States government and the people who run it.
[00:54:49.058 --> 00:54:49.438]  That's it.
[00:54:50.599 --> 00:54:56.282]  American people, you're a commodity and you don't deserve anything else.
[00:54:57.783 --> 00:55:02.305]  And they're going to make sure you continue to be a commodity as long as the empire exists.
[00:55:03.046 --> 00:55:07.268]  As long as you allow the Constitution to be raped.
[00:55:08.044 --> 00:55:14.931]  As the flood of illegals surges over the southern border, President Obama is going for broke, literally.
[00:55:15.151 --> 00:55:25.722]  CNS News reports that since the budget deal was signed in November of 2015, in just six months, Obama has added another trillion to our national debt.
[00:55:25.942 --> 00:55:28.945]  Bringing it to a monstrous $19 trillion.
[00:55:29.125 --> 00:55:38.753]  While more taxpayer money is thrown at the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement deportation budget, deportations themselves have decreased by nearly 43%.
[00:55:38.893 --> 00:55:46.660]  Breitbart reports, according to a recent chart from the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and National Interest,
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:56:02.205]  ICE removed nearly 43% fewer total aliens from the United States in the fiscal year of 2015 than it did in the fiscal year of 2012, and nearly 62% fewer aliens from the interior of the United States.
[00:56:02.485 --> 00:56:12.149]  Ironically, as the number of deportations the Obama administration carried out tumbled, its budget for removals and detention continued to grow, from $2,750,843,000
[00:56:16.690 --> 00:56:17.290]  We're good.
[00:56:36.001 --> 00:56:36.841]  We're good to go.
[00:56:53.986 --> 00:56:56.007]  As illegal immigrant crimes in the U.S.
[00:56:56.047 --> 00:57:05.992]  go largely unreported, even mentioning the unwarranted murders of American citizens by illegal immigrants is deemed racist by New World Order brainwashed dupes.
[00:57:06.392 --> 00:57:13.036]  And if you think the perpetual raping going on by ungrateful Islamic hordes is only occurring in Europe, think again.
[00:57:13.556 --> 00:57:21.144]  New documents say the man accused of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a gas station worker uttered Allah Akbar during the assault.
[00:57:21.404 --> 00:57:28.011]  Four illegal aliens from Guatemala are charged in the rape of a Massachusetts woman and the vicious beating of her boyfriend.
[00:57:28.311 --> 00:57:31.955]  And one of the suspects was arrested less than a month before the attack.
[00:57:32.495 --> 00:57:35.657]  The Quartet has been saddled with a slew of charges.
[00:57:36.078 --> 00:57:47.505]  It's been two years since Fusion reported that a staggering 80% of Central American girls and women crossing Mexico en route to the United States are raped along the way.
[00:57:47.846 --> 00:57:55.431]  Meanwhile, Panama announced they are transferring 3,000 U.S.-bound Cuban migrants to Mexico as Cuban migration spikes.
[00:57:55.791 --> 00:58:02.475]  And in 2016, immigrant families crossing the border is 40% higher than the previous record in 2014.
[00:58:03.715 --> 00:58:23.426]  When the history books are written, the flood of a great unknown and unchecked exodus of chaos in the face of all reason, civility and legality revolving around the enforcement of immigration laws that have dictated the policy for immigration for centuries will go down as one of the most reckless acts instigated by a U.S.
[00:58:23.506 --> 00:58:25.027]  President in modern history.
[00:58:25.486 --> 00:58:28.267]  But every time you try to get away from the government, they'll kill you.
[00:58:30.868 --> 00:58:31.868]  I'll put you in prison.
[00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:38.410]  Or I'll let you become an American.
[00:58:43.612 --> 00:58:44.852]  If you catch my drift.
[00:58:46.453 --> 00:58:47.713]  Because you're the new Indian.
[00:58:49.154 --> 00:58:50.574]  You're the new American Indian.
[00:58:50.654 --> 00:58:51.574]  Congratulations.
[00:58:52.475 --> 00:58:53.395]  Welcome to the club.
