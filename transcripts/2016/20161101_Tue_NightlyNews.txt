[00:00:20.168 --> 00:00:22.109]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:26.191]  It is Tuesday, November 1st, 2016, and I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:27.332]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:30.874 --> 00:00:31.314]  Tonight.
[00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:40.699]  Why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go?
[00:00:42.577 --> 00:00:43.637]  That's a good question.
[00:00:44.338 --> 00:00:49.980]  Hillary Clinton says the email scandal is nothing but a distraction.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.561]  And if you don't believe her, you can always fact check at hillaryclinton.com.
[00:00:56.902 --> 00:00:59.783]  Plus, the Kathy Shelton rape case.
[00:01:00.203 --> 00:01:04.504]  How Hillary Clinton blamed a little girl for her own rape.
[00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:08.246]  The only sexual assault case that the media doesn't care about.
[00:01:09.608 --> 00:01:20.336]  I'm standing up for what's right for me because I know it happened and she's trying to make me look like a liar and that I asked for it.
[00:01:20.856 --> 00:01:24.399]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.041]  Look, I'm not going to sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:36.303]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[00:01:36.323 --> 00:01:37.424]  Because it's already here.
[00:01:37.824 --> 00:01:38.484]  It's being announced.
[00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:42.307]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:44.048]  You don't let them break your will.
[00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:56.757]  Go to infowars.com forward slash app and download an app that took us over a year to develop that we're going to be expanding on the next few months with free video and audio and podcast feeds and breaking news and alerts and so much more.
[00:01:57.037 --> 00:01:59.979]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:01.120]  Take action!
[00:02:04.822 --> 00:02:06.723]  I train two, three times a day.
[00:02:07.503 --> 00:02:11.806]  They're brutal, agonizing, painful training sessions.
[00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:18.190]  I have to have the edge over my opponents.
[00:02:19.031 --> 00:02:24.094]  I believe that InfoWars products, Super Male Vitality, you know, that gives me the edge.
[00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:27.056]  Well, you have to know where you break.
[00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:30.740]  You know, ultimately, like, you don't push yourself to know where that breaking point is.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.422]  You're always going to be falling short of what your potential is.
[00:02:33.923 --> 00:02:39.609]  So it's really just about finding how far you can go.
[00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:57.878]  There's a lot of different things out there.
[00:02:58.982 --> 00:02:59.886]  I only use the best.
[00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:07.789]  Well, Hillary Clinton is seeing her poll numbers in a free fall.
[00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:16.394]  40% of her supporters are now saying, you know what, I'm not so sure about Hillary Clinton following this announcement from the FBI that they're going to reactivate her investigation.
[00:03:16.434 --> 00:03:17.955]  They're saying, what's going on here?
[00:03:18.476 --> 00:03:25.080]  Well, Hillary Clinton has made the rounds today to tell everyone, look away from the burning dumpster fire.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.301]  There's nothing to see here.
[00:03:26.781 --> 00:03:29.703]  This email scandal is a distraction.
[00:03:29.763 --> 00:03:31.384]  There is no case.
[00:03:31.824 --> 00:03:35.086]  So this is her on the campaign trail there in Ohio.
[00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:40.128]  She says, I'm sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about.
[00:03:40.208 --> 00:03:47.812]  Why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go?
[00:03:48.293 --> 00:03:51.454]  Well, that's because you should have been indicted a long time ago.
[00:03:51.494 --> 00:03:53.435]  That's the only mistake that they have made by
[00:03:54.756 --> 00:03:57.478]  Pulling this out, you know, just a week or so before the election.
[00:03:57.918 --> 00:03:59.839]  They should have indicted you months ago.
[00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:01.019]  That's the big issue here.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.382]  But she just says, you know, they're not going to find anything just like last time.
[00:04:05.482 --> 00:04:06.182]  Look away.
[00:04:06.883 --> 00:04:14.847]  In these last days, let's not get distracted from the real choice in this election and the consequences for your future.
[00:04:16.385 --> 00:04:23.754]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton herself and all of her minions have gone full tinfoil hat.
[00:04:23.794 --> 00:04:27.458]  They're pulling out all of the conspiracy theories they can possibly muster.
[00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:30.522]  Of course, they've been pushing this Russian agent thing.
[00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:32.784]  People have even been calling James Comey
[00:04:33.726 --> 00:04:40.255]  He's in cahoots with the Russians now, but last night I was seeing on Twitter, just thinking, oh goodness, oh lord, what is going on now?
[00:04:40.556 --> 00:04:46.825]  They were really pushing this story about this Russian server that was allegedly inside of Trump Tower.
[00:04:47.225 --> 00:04:48.247]  She tweets this out.
[00:04:49.295 --> 00:04:53.718]  You know, it's time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia.
[00:04:53.738 --> 00:04:57.121]  And then she goes on to point out, he has a secret server.
[00:04:57.321 --> 00:04:58.282]  Yes, Donald Trump.
[00:04:58.742 --> 00:05:06.849]  Okay, so first of all, Hillary Clinton is basically making the case that someone would have a secret server for nefarious reasons.
[00:05:07.489 --> 00:05:09.551]  Not because it was just convenient.
[00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:13.414]  So here, once again, she's saying, well, I have a secret server.
[00:05:13.574 --> 00:05:18.038]  Well, you have a secret server and it's nefarious and you're talking to the Russians.
[00:05:18.498 --> 00:05:26.624]  So, and of course, this is after Harry Reid says to the FBI demands that, you know, tell the world what it is you're holding out against Trump and the Russians.
[00:05:27.405 --> 00:05:28.326]  So they're, they're really going.
[00:05:28.806 --> 00:05:38.850]  Let me just tell you, this was from one anonymous veteran spy who gave the scoop to Slate.com and to Mother Jones, okay?
[00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.752]  These are the sites that are, like, breaking this big scoop about this Russian server.
[00:05:44.452 --> 00:05:44.853]  Okay.
[00:05:45.694 --> 00:05:53.564]  Well, so then the New York Times comes out and the FBI, I mean, immediately debunks this and they're like, look, we investigated Donald Trump.
[00:05:53.724 --> 00:05:56.608]  The FBI sees no clear link to Russia.
[00:05:56.728 --> 00:05:59.732]  So you just know Hillary Clinton is going rats.
[00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:00.673]  Spoiled again!
[00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:04.136]  I would have tricked you if it weren't for those pesky kids!
[00:06:04.637 --> 00:06:12.805]  So the FBI is talking about, for much of the summer, they were pursuing a widening investigation into the Russian role in the American presidential campaign.
[00:06:13.285 --> 00:06:15.968]  Agents scrutinized advisors close to Trump.
[00:06:16.048 --> 00:06:18.971]  They looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures.
[00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:32.315]  They searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats and even chased a lead, which they ultimately came to doubt, about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank.
[00:06:33.016 --> 00:06:42.339]  Law enforcement officials say none of those investigations have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government.
[00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.970]  My goodness.
[00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.451]  So there you go, debunked.
[00:06:46.471 --> 00:06:53.393]  But they really tried to come out hardcore last night in the final hours pushing this Russian agent story.
[00:06:54.053 --> 00:06:55.053]  But that wasn't going to work.
[00:06:55.513 --> 00:06:58.054]  So then they had to roll out this other story in New York Times.
[00:06:58.394 --> 00:07:03.575]  Donald Trump used a legally dubious method to avoid paying taxes decades ago.
[00:07:04.115 --> 00:07:06.016]  So Donald Trump, a billionaire,
[00:07:06.856 --> 00:07:12.022]  He uses a loophole that's legally available to any billionaire.
[00:07:12.282 --> 00:07:18.268]  Decades ago, this loophole has since been outlawed, of course, but at the time, it was completely legal.
[00:07:18.429 --> 00:07:23.894]  It was readily available to any billionaire to exploit this tax loophole to where he didn't have to pay a dime.
[00:07:24.255 --> 00:07:27.078]  Now, I don't like it, but we all know what's happening.
[00:07:27.318 --> 00:07:32.742]  That's why I'm saying I'm not going to be surprised by what I find in some billionaire's tax returns.
[00:07:33.282 --> 00:07:45.790]  This is why I was really supporting Rand Paul and his calls for a flat tax to just eliminate this grotesquely insane tax code we have that, of course, people who make a lot of money in companies and others are going to exploit.
[00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:52.914]  Heck, I try to pay the least amount of taxes as I possibly can, so it doesn't surprise me someone paying billions would exploit a loophole.
[00:07:53.195 --> 00:07:56.257]  And, of course, this is what Donald Trump pointed out in the debate.
[00:07:56.877 --> 00:08:03.000]  This is a loophole that Hillary Clinton failed to close during her years in the United States Senate.
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.600]  Why didn't she close those loopholes?
[00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:18.386]  But meanwhile, not only has Hillary Clinton herself used similar loopholes to avoid paying taxes, her Wall Street fundraising actually benefited from a loophole in a federal anti-corruption rule.
[00:08:18.406 --> 00:08:21.828]  So this is a Securities and Exchange Commission
[00:08:22.868 --> 00:08:23.689]  I don't know.
[00:08:41.092 --> 00:08:41.252]  I don't
[00:09:00.723 --> 00:09:02.044]  But the hypocrisy doesn't stop there.
[00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:34.141]  Now today, her thing in Ohio, or maybe it was in Florida, excuse me, she brings out Ms.
[00:09:34.281 --> 00:09:35.222]  Universe, Ms.
[00:09:35.282 --> 00:09:35.802]  Machado.
[00:09:35.882 --> 00:09:36.722]  She rolls her out, Ms.
[00:09:36.762 --> 00:09:41.104]  Machado reintroduces Hillary Clinton to bring back around the scandal.
[00:09:41.404 --> 00:09:43.745]  This is how you know they're all out of ammo.
[00:09:45.065 --> 00:09:48.867]  They're dying here because they're bringing back out their October surprise, Ms.
[00:09:48.947 --> 00:09:54.249]  Alicia Machado, to reiterate that Trump is bad for women and he doesn't care about women.
[00:09:55.029 --> 00:10:19.619]  When Hillary Clinton herself decades ago set the precedent, showed what her principles are when it came to how she is the champion for women and children, when she defended a rapist who raped a 12-year-old girl, raped her so brutally that she was put in a coma for about five days, woke up, had to have surgery, was told she would never be able to have children,
[00:10:20.419 --> 00:10:28.404]  And the Federalist wrote a really great article today about how Hillary Clinton learned how to manipulate the law by defending this child rapist.
[00:10:28.724 --> 00:10:42.732]  Now, we actually had Kathy Shelton in studio today to retell this story and to talk a little bit about how it feels to have had her life destroyed by Hillary Clinton, you know, in 1975.
[00:10:42.872 --> 00:10:49.416]  And then years later, having to hear this woman say how sexual assault survivors deserve to be believed.
[00:10:50.979 --> 00:11:11.784]  You look at Hillary Clinton's career and it baffles me so much that she has been allowed, mostly by our mainstream press and to the shame of her own party, to somehow be held up as some kind of champion for women and fighter for justice for children through 40 years of her career, when time after time she's chosen the side of rapists just to make herself look good.
[00:11:12.164 --> 00:11:15.065]  I want to send a message to every survivor of sexual assault.
[00:11:15.725 --> 00:11:18.466]  Don't let anyone silence your voice.
[00:11:19.366 --> 00:11:23.169]  You have a right to be heard and you have a right to be believed.
[00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.650]  We're with you.
[00:11:30.234 --> 00:11:34.317]  Hillary's on tape laughing and saying that she knows that they're guilty.
[00:11:34.337 --> 00:11:39.962]  And has made some other remarks.
[00:11:46.231 --> 00:12:00.968]  Uh, down the line and I'm standing up for what's right for me because I know it happened and she's trying to make me look like a liar and that I asked for it and all that.
[00:12:02.189 --> 00:12:04.610]  And by the way, we should pull up a photo of you when you were 12.
[00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:05.990]  That's online.
[00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:08.030]  People can also go to theirlivesfoundation.net.
[00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:11.791]  We can put that website on screen for people so we can personalize this.
[00:12:12.211 --> 00:12:13.191]  I mean, you were a little girl.
[00:12:13.371 --> 00:12:14.752]  I have a 12-year-old daughter.
[00:12:15.352 --> 00:12:16.132]  I have an 8-year-old daughter.
[00:12:16.292 --> 00:12:20.673]  And, you know, before I had daughters and children, I would get upset hearing about abuse of women and children.
[00:12:20.693 --> 00:12:29.595]  But now, I mean, I'm going to be honest, it makes me just start feeling very violent whenever I think about people abusing little girls, especially.
[00:12:31.752 --> 00:12:33.093]  Send it out to the Crime Lab.
[00:12:34.653 --> 00:12:38.355]  Or, go back up to the Forensic Lab.
[00:12:38.395 --> 00:12:38.996]  Crime Lab?
[00:12:39.256 --> 00:12:39.476]  Nope.
[00:12:39.796 --> 00:12:42.437]  Just a pair of underpants.
[00:12:42.517 --> 00:12:46.700]  Neatly cut out the part they were going to test.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:47.320]  Fantastic!
[00:12:47.944 --> 00:12:53.790]  Now that's Hillary bragging to journalists, she thinks to her friends, that she cut the blood out of his underwear.
[00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.631]  Her blood.
[00:12:55.472 --> 00:12:57.434]  And she's getting off on it.
[00:12:57.534 --> 00:13:01.238]  It's like, what freaking planet does this demon come from?
[00:13:01.278 --> 00:13:01.718]  That's the thing.
[00:13:02.039 --> 00:13:05.943]  In all the WikiLeaks, which confirms everything you said, they get off on bad.
[00:13:06.843 --> 00:13:08.785]  Where they could do better doing good,
[00:13:10.017 --> 00:13:10.557]  They don't.
[00:13:10.677 --> 00:13:11.737]  They want to do that.
[00:13:12.158 --> 00:13:20.380]  Well, she talked about having public positions versus private positions, and apparently public position is, I need to be a defender of women and children.
[00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:21.540]  Private position?
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.160]  I cut the blood off his underwear.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:24.681]  Proud!
[00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:26.721]  I'm proud of getting somebody off like this.
[00:13:26.821 --> 00:13:27.541]  I just want to win.
[00:13:27.901 --> 00:13:30.822]  I want to send a message to every survivor of sexual assault.
[00:13:31.462 --> 00:13:34.223]  Don't let anyone silence your voice.
[00:13:35.114 --> 00:13:38.949]  You have a right to be heard and you have a right to be believed.
[00:13:39.812 --> 00:13:40.354]  We're with you.
[00:13:41.564 --> 00:13:47.466]  Well this morning we learned that the FBI was looking into Trump's alleged ties with Russia.
[00:13:47.526 --> 00:13:53.847]  They did investigating for much of the summer actually looking for financial connections with Russian financial figures.
[00:13:53.907 --> 00:14:04.651]  They were looking for people involved with the hacking of the computers with the Democrats there and also scrutinized advisors of Donald Trump and they said look we have found no link.
[00:14:05.071 --> 00:14:05.871]  But it turns out
[00:14:06.631 --> 00:14:14.160]  Now we're learning that a lot of Hillary Clinton's key advisors are also the focus of a major FBI investigation.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.541]  Margaret Howell joins me now.
[00:14:15.962 --> 00:14:20.787]  So what are we seeing here with this, I mean, five separate FBI cases?
[00:14:20.867 --> 00:14:21.408]  Isn't this crazy?
[00:14:21.408 --> 00:14:21.768]  Absolutely.
[00:14:21.788 --> 00:14:28.071]  So the FBI, they're probing five entities surrounding Hillary Clinton, of course, Huma Abedin is number one.
[00:14:28.792 --> 00:14:32.754]  They're looking at her, possibly she's committed perjury.
[00:14:32.794 --> 00:14:34.135]  That would be one aspect of this.
[00:14:34.755 --> 00:14:41.738]  And more on that, Terry McAuliffe is perhaps the biggest bombshell in this information because the
[00:14:42.739 --> 00:14:54.567]  They claim that he sold access to the Chinese for, you know, access to Hillary Clinton, that we saw this policy change in relation to money being changed hands.
[00:14:54.927 --> 00:15:00.350]  They're looking at his involvement with a Chinese investor named Wang Wenliang currently.
[00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:02.912]  And this is going to be one of the biggest stories of 2017.
[00:15:03.092 --> 00:15:04.593]  It's under wraps now.
[00:15:04.613 --> 00:15:08.195]  Very corrupt Virginia governor and very close to the Clintons.
[00:15:08.255 --> 00:15:11.037]  He was the guy that gave $600,000 of his own money.
[00:15:12.438 --> 00:15:12.859]  I think?
[00:15:27.295 --> 00:15:32.078]  So everybody around her is basically corrupt or on par with being as corrupt as she is.
[00:15:32.499 --> 00:15:45.007]  John Podesta, of course, and the Clinton Foundation also under investigation, and a string of other people that are low-level within her campaign that have possibly committed criminal acts under Clinton.
[00:15:46.108 --> 00:15:47.209]  Major cesspool.
[00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:47.649]  Right.
[00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:54.655]  Virtually everyone in Clinton's inner circle and their families are involved now being probed by the FBI.
[00:15:54.695 --> 00:16:04.702]  Of course, something else that we're learning is emails are showing that the Justice Department official who actually oversaw the Clinton probe initially has close ties to Podesta.
[00:16:05.263 --> 00:16:09.866]  He was actually trying to get his son to be involved in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[00:16:10.067 --> 00:16:10.247]  Right.
[00:16:12.128 --> 00:16:13.089]  It's just so messy.
[00:16:13.529 --> 00:16:23.474]  What needs to happen, so John Podesta, his BFF over at the DOJ, is the one that is presumably in charge of the criminal investigation, putting it together against Hillary Clinton.
[00:16:23.514 --> 00:16:25.435]  That needs to change immediately, that official.
[00:16:26.136 --> 00:16:29.498]  But look, Leigh-Anne, we've seen this unsuccessful attempt by the Democrats.
[00:16:29.858 --> 00:16:31.359]  They're jumping ship like rats.
[00:16:31.499 --> 00:16:33.040]  Nobody wants to touch her anymore.
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.221]  She's become a pariah, Leigh-Anne of sorts.
[00:16:35.761 --> 00:16:36.421]  Exactly.
[00:16:36.461 --> 00:16:38.242]  Well, they were kind of seeing the writing on the wall back
[00:16:39.603 --> 00:16:46.406]  In 2015, in fact, Podesta was telling Cheryl Mills, you know, we're going to have to dump all of those emails.
[00:16:46.466 --> 00:16:48.407]  Better to do it sooner rather than later.
[00:16:48.867 --> 00:16:57.231]  They're all kind of joking about her other aide, Neera Tanden, who said, whoever told Clinton she could use the server should be drawn and quartered.
[00:16:57.611 --> 00:17:01.913]  I mean, so within her inner workings, they know there's going to be some major trouble.
[00:17:01.933 --> 00:17:03.414]  And they're like, how can we clean this up?
[00:17:03.494 --> 00:17:04.915]  Even the president's come out saying,
[00:17:05.655 --> 00:17:06.075]  I didn't know
[00:17:35.515 --> 00:17:36.656]  Dear God!
[00:17:36.777 --> 00:17:37.658]  Stop it already!
[00:17:37.898 --> 00:17:38.398]  It's over!
[00:17:38.458 --> 00:17:40.961]  Get off of it!
[00:17:41.021 --> 00:17:41.522]  It's hilarious.
[00:17:41.582 --> 00:17:42.643]  I literally thought he was having a stroke.
[00:17:42.984 --> 00:17:46.708]  We also see Chris Matthews in support of Trump a couple of days ago.
[00:17:46.728 --> 00:17:47.569]  I'm like, wait a second.
[00:17:47.889 --> 00:17:49.531]  The fourth estate is also leaving her.
[00:17:49.551 --> 00:17:50.452]  Which is hilarious.
[00:17:50.512 --> 00:17:56.959]  Well that's the thing is a lot of people are now beginning to see the writing on the wall and they can see that corruption surrounds her.
[00:17:57.479 --> 00:18:07.570]  We knew that they were propping her up in the first place because so many of them were involved in all of this and she would have taken them all down with her like a house of cards, so they had to prop her up.
[00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.874]  But now they're seeing, I mean, with James Comey coming out and doing this, they're like, wow.
[00:18:12.475 --> 00:18:19.140]  They've either got a lot of dirt somewhere that they know is going to be released by WikiLeaks or Kim.com or someone else.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:24.344]  There's a lot more information to be forthcoming, so they've got to get ahead of this and not get taken down with her.
[00:18:25.064 --> 00:18:28.026]  But it is very interesting to see the changing tide.
[00:18:28.106 --> 00:18:31.729]  As Alex Jones keeps saying, it's like an amazing time to be alive right now.
[00:18:31.869 --> 00:18:36.774]  Even the ABC poll just really quickly has Trump up the daily ticker by one percentage point.
[00:18:36.834 --> 00:18:42.840]  Who would have ever thought in the history we would ever be seeing, we would ever see ABC actually say that Trump is ahead of Clinton.
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.782]  I nearly, you could fall out of my chair right now.
[00:18:44.802 --> 00:18:45.943]  This is a remarkable time.
[00:19:01.618 --> 00:19:19.291]  My fellow Americans, my fellow humans on planet Earth, there is an epic, legendary awakening of nationalism and populism happening from the Brexit to the Donald Trump phenomenon to Russia pulling out of the New World Order and arresting the bankster oligarchs.
[00:19:20.012 --> 00:19:22.413]  Humanity's will for self-determination
[00:19:23.334 --> 00:19:25.155]  And freedom is expressing itself.
[00:19:25.636 --> 00:19:33.041]  The great classical liberalisms of Thomas Jefferson and Francis Bacon are reawakening right now.
[00:19:33.822 --> 00:19:43.009]  And it's because of the historical times we live in that InfoWars is going to embark on an unprecedented 52-hour broadcast.
[00:19:43.049 --> 00:19:47.672]  We've done 24-hour broadcasts before, but we've never gone 52 hours.
[00:19:49.113 --> 00:19:51.816]  This Monday, from 11 a.m.
[00:19:51.876 --> 00:19:57.563]  Central, right through Tuesday, right into Wednesday, when the Wednesday show ends at 3 p.m.
[00:19:57.603 --> 00:20:08.355]  Central, we will broadcast for an unprecedented, legendary, over-the-top, 52 hours live, The Second Great Awakening is taking place.
[00:20:09.176 --> 00:20:16.598]  We are in the dawn of a new era of renaissance, of rediscovery and human liberty.
[00:20:17.238 --> 00:20:30.342]  Donald Trump, the Brexit, Infowars, Matt Drudge, Breitbart, WorldNetDaily and so many others are only one small manifestation in the fire of liberty that is now exploding across the globe.
[00:20:30.842 --> 00:20:33.363]  Most people just discovered there's a war going on for their minds.
[00:20:34.107 --> 00:20:36.729]  Yes, in the last 50 years it's a new kind of war, mind war.
[00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:38.711]  We have truth, the globalists have lies.
[00:20:39.391 --> 00:20:44.856]  And as the sleeping giant awakens, the terror in the globalist psyche only intensifies.
[00:20:45.456 --> 00:20:48.379]  Join us and spread the word about the awakening.
[00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:53.563]  It all kicks off this Monday, November 7th, 2016 at 11 a.m.
[00:20:53.603 --> 00:20:57.006]  Central at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:21:01.345 --> 00:21:08.727]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:21:09.228 --> 00:21:16.870]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.231]  As president, I will make it clear.
[00:21:20.111 --> 00:21:24.836]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[00:21:25.417 --> 00:21:30.763]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[00:21:30.863 --> 00:21:34.367]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[00:21:34.407 --> 00:21:37.210]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.833]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:21:42.222 --> 00:21:44.265]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[00:21:44.605 --> 00:21:48.070]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[00:21:48.291 --> 00:21:56.162]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:58.560]  The U.S.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.183]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[00:22:02.584 --> 00:22:10.170]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.912]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[00:22:13.272 --> 00:22:16.114]  Of course not, because she's... Look, there's a really loud noise.
[00:22:16.155 --> 00:22:21.639]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:23.881]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[00:22:27.677 --> 00:22:32.128]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:23:04.565 --> 00:23:07.066]  Could Huma Abedin just destroy Hillary Clinton?
[00:23:07.506 --> 00:23:08.667]  It's certainly looking that way.
[00:23:08.727 --> 00:23:10.067]  We have an article up on our website.
[00:23:10.147 --> 00:23:12.968]  The Feds have leaked new information regarding Wienergate.
[00:23:13.449 --> 00:23:16.750]  It just could derail her campaign entirely, also could indict her.
[00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:19.131]  Now, it's been a hell of a week for Hillary Clinton.
[00:23:19.491 --> 00:23:22.672]  Michelle Obama is un-retweeting tweets from Hillary.
[00:23:23.152 --> 00:23:33.617]  Jason Chavitz, he's under an investigation, an ethics probe, because he's been threatened with smearing the campaign, while liberal talking heads are saying that he's responsible for the FBI probe being reopened.
[00:23:33.637 --> 00:23:34.337]  But what we do know
[00:23:34.837 --> 00:23:35.377]  Here's what we know.
[00:23:35.417 --> 00:23:42.640]  The FBI, they've reopened this criminal investigation into one of the two presidential candidates running for president, Hillary Clinton.
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:44.140]  That's major news, don't you think?
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.541]  You'd think we could see this trending on Twitter more than we have.
[00:23:46.761 --> 00:23:49.882]  Anyway, Clinton, after discovering this new information,
[00:23:50.382 --> 00:23:58.710]  And it's because of Anthony Weiner and those infamous BlackBerries he was using to send little nudie pics of himself to a 15-year-old minor.
[00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:00.411]  He was under investigation from the feds.
[00:24:00.451 --> 00:24:06.697]  This we know this week, but apparently there are bombshells on this BlackBerry that could very well indict Hillary Clinton.
[00:24:06.737 --> 00:24:10.480]  Now we know that Clinton, she worked on the Nixon-Watergate committee.
[00:24:12.902 --> 00:24:15.684]  And she understands the importance of destroying the evidence.
[00:24:15.744 --> 00:24:17.725]  She thought that she'd gotten rid of all of it.
[00:24:18.126 --> 00:24:19.707]  Smashing those blackberries with a hammer.
[00:24:19.767 --> 00:24:23.989]  It looks like she forgot one little device which actually could bring her down.
[00:24:24.169 --> 00:24:32.595]  Now, regarding this article specifically that's on her site, it details on Monday the thousands of new emails from the Clinton campaign and John Podesta.
[00:24:33.115 --> 00:24:33.516]  We're good to go.
[00:24:50.098 --> 00:24:50.598]  I don't know.
[00:25:10.318 --> 00:25:13.541]  The FBI's mutiny to reopen the Clinton investigation has been unbelievable.
[00:25:36.277 --> 00:25:43.621]  Well, it's damning evidence, it's unraveling, Clinton campaign, it's hemorrhaging at the neck, and we're covering it all for you as we have it.
[00:25:43.721 --> 00:25:45.422]  Well, check out this article in its entirety.
[00:25:45.462 --> 00:25:47.203]  It's up on our website, InfoWars.com.
[00:25:47.563 --> 00:25:50.524]  While you're at it, download our app, InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:25:50.985 --> 00:25:53.346]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:26:01.766 --> 00:26:04.189]  Alright everybody this is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:07.834]  Now I keep seeing a lot of misinformation being spread across social media.
[00:26:08.514 --> 00:26:15.463]  People seeing false WikiLeaks emails and you know when you read them it's too good to be true.
[00:26:15.744 --> 00:26:17.866]  So I found this one right here I think this is the
[00:26:19.387 --> 00:26:33.712]  the best fake one so far because it says subject the dogs are loose you can see that right here which is kind of funny it says I'll be meeting with source later this week for some pre-programming of machines these machines will be humming in November
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:38.783]  Well, you know, when it sounds too good to be true, more than likely it's too good to be true.
[00:26:39.523 --> 00:26:49.730]  So I had to post this to tell people to stop spreading misinformation because you're going to have people in the Clinton campaign, people out there that are going to Photoshop and make these fake emails.
[00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:53.074]  So, everybody needs to learn how to use Wikileaks and how to take one of these
[00:27:05.501 --> 00:27:12.606]  emails as you see right here where it says I'll be meeting with Soros later and I'm going to show you how to go over into WikiLeaks and we're going to look for it.
[00:27:13.547 --> 00:27:21.492]  So since it says machines will be humming right here that's something that sticks out that you're not normally going to see.
[00:27:22.013 --> 00:27:31.800]  We're going to go here you click on Podesta email since these are the ones that they're referring to because in the back I'll show you really quick it has
[00:27:34.036 --> 00:27:35.057]  John Pedestan here.
[00:27:35.257 --> 00:27:37.918]  So that's part of the Pedesta Wikileaks email thing.
[00:27:38.759 --> 00:27:41.100]  So you go to Wikileaks.org.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.060]  Like I said, we'll go back.
[00:27:42.381 --> 00:27:44.021]  This will be the main page of Wikileaks.
[00:27:44.622 --> 00:27:46.343]  Here's the Pedesta part right here.
[00:27:46.383 --> 00:27:57.549]  You click on it and then you put in quotation marks, the machines will be humming in quotation.
[00:27:58.109 --> 00:28:02.651]  And before you hit submit, let's go back and make sure machines will be humming.
[00:28:03.212 --> 00:28:03.372]  So
[00:28:05.165 --> 00:28:06.666]  You want to make sure you have the right thing.
[00:28:10.267 --> 00:28:13.968]  And then it's this easy to find out whether or not it's real or not.
[00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:18.630]  Your query returned no results whatsoever.
[00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:26.033]  That shows you that that is a fake, photoshopped, Podesta, Wikileak email that does not exist.
[00:28:26.735 --> 00:28:33.637]  They're not gonna be coming out talking like that blatantly, telling you that they're gonna have all this, you know, kind of corruption.
[00:28:33.697 --> 00:28:34.917]  It's stuff you're gonna have to dig for.
[00:28:35.918 --> 00:28:39.519]  If you don't believe me on that one, let's say, meeting with Soros later.
[00:28:40.519 --> 00:28:41.319]  So we'll try that.
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:50.562]  So back here, since it's a sentence, meeting with Soros later.
[00:28:52.264 --> 00:28:54.785]  Now, there's always a possibility that that could bring something up, but no.
[00:28:55.165 --> 00:29:00.206]  Your query returned no results, because that email does not exist.
[00:29:00.826 --> 00:29:01.806]  Now, let's look at this.
[00:29:02.386 --> 00:29:06.307]  We're on my page.
[00:29:07.707 --> 00:29:12.248]  Let's go to Podesta, Emails, Podesta 25.
[00:29:12.829 --> 00:29:14.729]  That is the newest dup for today.
[00:29:16.061 --> 00:29:28.768]  In here you'll see people take screenshots things like that and the easiest way if you see something you want to find out whether or not it's real because people are gonna take screenshots you're not gonna know the email number or whatever it is it may be
[00:29:32.816 --> 00:29:44.739]  So here we go, this one says, so we can say all these things you'd like her to say, but when she says she's against reinstating on that debate stage, I'm worried that will be shorthanded as she's probing.
[00:29:44.959 --> 00:29:48.419]  So let's find out if that's real or a fake email.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.521]  So we're gonna use shorthanded as she's.
[00:29:56.061 --> 00:29:56.221]  So.
[00:29:59.012 --> 00:30:05.655]  Shorthanded as, let's make sure we got it, shorthanded as she's.
[00:30:08.956 --> 00:30:10.657]  And then we'll click on this, there you go.
[00:30:11.697 --> 00:30:13.298]  Shows you that this is a real email.
[00:30:14.238 --> 00:30:22.822]  Then you open up the email, you command F over here, shorthanded, and as you see right down here,
[00:30:23.928 --> 00:30:26.929]  I am worried that we'll be shorthanded as She's Pro Bank.
[00:30:27.049 --> 00:30:28.909]  So you can see that that's a real email.
[00:30:29.409 --> 00:30:30.069]  It's searchable.
[00:30:30.369 --> 00:30:35.170]  It's in the Wikileaks data dump from the Podesta emails.
[00:30:36.291 --> 00:30:37.631]  And this is an easy way.
[00:30:37.671 --> 00:30:52.774]  It literally takes two seconds to find out if these emails are fake or real because we need to get out of the habit of just seeing something on Twitter, seeing something on Facebook, and thinking that that person's already done their research and that person is a trusted source
[00:30:53.654 --> 00:31:02.762]  For gathering what it is you need to be informed and to be able to share that not look like a dumbass So let's do one more just to go over.
[00:31:02.782 --> 00:31:12.310]  It says off record if press on whether we are essentially admitting the possibility that she deleted some emails It pressed on whether so we'll do that.
[00:31:12.731 --> 00:31:19.557]  So we'll go here one more time Boom
[00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:32.450]  Here we go.
[00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:32.951]  Off record.
[00:31:32.991 --> 00:31:36.953]  Impress on whether we are essentially admitting the possibility that she deleted some email.
[00:31:36.973 --> 00:31:37.494]  So there you go.
[00:31:37.774 --> 00:31:39.495]  This is a quick, easy step.
[00:31:39.715 --> 00:31:43.298]  So let's go back and look at it from the beginning one more time to help you guys out.
[00:31:43.338 --> 00:31:48.541]  So if you see something that looks this good to be true, I'll be meeting with Source later this week for some pre-programming of machines.
[00:31:49.162 --> 00:31:51.903]  You know, that's obviously something that someone's photoshopped.
[00:31:52.524 --> 00:31:55.366]  You just go back here, main page,
[00:31:56.454 --> 00:31:59.517]  Click on the Podesta email or whatever the new dump is by WikiLeaks.
[00:31:59.977 --> 00:32:01.238]  We don't know what's coming out tomorrow.
[00:32:01.738 --> 00:32:05.021]  And then you go in here, put in quotations, a sentence that's going to stand out.
[00:32:05.782 --> 00:32:06.522]  Type that sentence.
[00:32:06.802 --> 00:32:07.323]  Hit search.
[00:32:07.423 --> 00:32:08.724]  If it pops up, it's real.
[00:32:09.204 --> 00:32:11.486]  If it doesn't pop up, then it doesn't.
[00:32:12.087 --> 00:32:17.431]  And if multiple things pop up, like in an email, then what you want to do is once you get into that email,
[00:32:19.082 --> 00:32:20.543]  Like, say, we're in this email right now.
[00:32:21.064 --> 00:32:26.568]  You do Command-F, which at the top up here will give you an area and just look for a keyword.
[00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:28.750]  Help.
[00:32:31.613 --> 00:32:32.073]  Language.
[00:32:32.173 --> 00:32:32.454]  Boom.
[00:32:32.874 --> 00:32:34.055]  And you can find that word.
[00:32:34.696 --> 00:32:35.057]  In there.
[00:32:35.117 --> 00:32:38.982]  So this is just a quick tutorial on how to spot fake Wikileaks.
[00:32:39.042 --> 00:32:46.051]  So everyone should know from now on when you see one that sounds too good to be true, get on Wikileaks, look for yourself, make sure that exists.
[00:32:46.772 --> 00:32:47.994]  And if it's real, then share.
[00:32:48.034 --> 00:32:49.656]  If it's not, don't be part of the problem.
[00:32:49.896 --> 00:32:51.799]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:33:02.455 --> 00:33:05.859]  My fellow Americans, my fellow humans on planet Earth.
[00:33:06.704 --> 00:33:20.134]  There is an epic, legendary awakening of nationalism and populism happening from the Brexit to the Donald Trump phenomenon to Russia pulling out of the New World Order and arresting the bankster oligarchs.
[00:33:20.855 --> 00:33:25.999]  Humanity's will for self-determination and freedom is expressing itself.
[00:33:26.499 --> 00:33:33.845]  The great classical liberalisms of Thomas Jefferson and Francis Bacon are reawakening right now.
[00:33:34.665 --> 00:33:43.860]  And it's because of the historical times we live in that InfoWars is going to embark on an unprecedented 52-hour broadcast.
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:48.507]  We've done 24-hour broadcasts before, but we've never gone 52 hours.
[00:33:49.949 --> 00:33:52.652]  This Monday, from 11 a.m.
[00:33:52.712 --> 00:33:58.399]  Central, right through Tuesday, right into Wednesday, when the Wednesday show ends at 3 p.m.
[00:33:58.459 --> 00:34:09.211]  Central, we will broadcast for an unprecedented, legendary, over-the-top, 52 hours live, The Second Great Awakening is taking place.
[00:34:10.012 --> 00:34:17.454]  We are in the dawn of a new era of renaissance, of rediscovery and human liberty.
[00:34:18.074 --> 00:34:31.178]  Donald Trump, the Brexit, Infowars, Matt Drudge, Breitbart, WorldNetDaily and so many others are only one small manifestation in the fire of liberty that is now exploding across the globe.
[00:34:31.678 --> 00:34:34.199]  Most people just discovered there's a war going on for their minds.
[00:34:34.963 --> 00:34:37.585]  Yes, in the last 50 years it's a new kind of war, mind war.
[00:34:37.985 --> 00:34:39.566]  We have truth, the globalists have lies.
[00:34:40.227 --> 00:34:45.711]  And as the sleeping giant awakens, the terror in the globalist psyche only intensifies.
[00:34:46.291 --> 00:34:49.213]  Join us and spread the word about the awakening.
[00:34:49.874 --> 00:34:54.397]  It all kicks off this Monday, November 7th, 2016 at 11 a.m.
[00:34:54.437 --> 00:34:57.840]  Central at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:02.182 --> 00:35:09.564]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:35:10.065 --> 00:35:17.707]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[00:35:17.987 --> 00:35:20.068]  As president, I will make it clear.
[00:35:20.948 --> 00:35:25.690]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:31.612]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[00:35:31.693 --> 00:35:34.654]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[00:35:35.234 --> 00:35:38.035]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[00:35:38.095 --> 00:35:40.656]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:35:43.058 --> 00:35:45.099]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[00:35:45.439 --> 00:35:48.900]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[00:35:49.121 --> 00:35:57.004]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[00:35:58.916 --> 00:35:59.396]  The U.S.
[00:35:59.436 --> 00:36:03.019]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[00:36:03.419 --> 00:36:11.024]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[00:36:11.385 --> 00:36:13.706]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[00:36:13.726 --> 00:36:17.569]  Of course not, because she's... Look, there's a really loud noise.
[00:36:17.669 --> 00:36:22.492]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[00:36:22.512 --> 00:36:24.714]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[00:36:28.573 --> 00:36:32.987]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:37:07.168 --> 00:37:10.109]  David Knight here with Danny Williams, the son of Bill Clinton.
[00:37:10.169 --> 00:37:15.371]  He alleges he would like to get a test to prove it or to disprove it, and we just finished a press conference here.
[00:37:15.831 --> 00:37:27.614]  He is asking Monica Lewinsky to turn over her dress that has Bill Clinton's DNA on it, so that could save him a very costly legal battle because Bill Clinton has not responded at all.
[00:37:27.895 --> 00:37:28.475]  Let me ask you,
[00:37:29.335 --> 00:37:34.019]  How do you feel about the fact that this has gone on for decades and Bill Clinton hasn't responded at all?
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:37.423]  He could end this very easily by just voluntarily doing a DNA test.
[00:37:37.563 --> 00:37:38.604]  Right, correct.
[00:37:40.686 --> 00:37:50.435]  You know, I have mixed feelings because, you know, you got the hurt feelings, but I also got the feelings that keep me pushing every day to keep going forward and doing what I'm doing today.
[00:37:50.455 --> 00:37:51.356]  I mean,
[00:37:52.972 --> 00:37:57.894]  It's the truth, and I'm going to do whatever I can to keep it out there.
[00:37:58.294 --> 00:38:08.157]  And whenever you talk to the mainstream media, like you did in Las Vegas, all they're interested in doing is attacking you as a Trump surrogate, but you were pushing on this for decades before Trump was on the scene.
[00:38:08.497 --> 00:38:11.058]  It's a completely different political situation that we've got here now.
[00:38:11.878 --> 00:38:12.999]  I guess the question would be,
[00:38:13.699 --> 00:38:15.941]  Why isn't the press concerned about this?
[00:38:15.981 --> 00:38:23.726]  They seem to be willing to believe women who have come out after 30 years and say they were touched inappropriately at an event, in many cases didn't even happen.
[00:38:24.126 --> 00:38:30.230]  And yet, here's a situation where we know the proclivities of Bill Clinton, and for decades they have ignored this.
[00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:33.292]  Do you think that there's some kind of special privilege?
[00:38:34.353 --> 00:38:35.934]  We're always hearing about white privileges.
[00:38:35.994 --> 00:38:37.415]  Is there a Clinton privilege involved here?
[00:38:37.435 --> 00:38:43.159]  I'm hearing not just special privileges, I just think there's some kind of conspiracy going on between them and the Clintons.
[00:38:43.839 --> 00:38:44.180]  Yeah.
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:51.325]  And of course we've seen that with the star, the close connections with the star, and the fact that there's not been a DNA test.
[00:38:51.645 --> 00:38:56.609]  We see even left-leaning fact-checkers, quote-unquote, like Snopes, saying that this is unproven.
[00:38:57.229 --> 00:38:59.111]  They don't say it's disproven, okay?
[00:38:59.931 --> 00:39:03.134]  It has not really been investigated, and so that's what you're trying to do here.
[00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:07.077]  You have limited financial ability to pursue this case.
[00:39:07.357 --> 00:39:09.098]  That's why it's coming up at this time, is that correct?
[00:39:09.218 --> 00:39:09.518]  Correct.
[00:39:10.479 --> 00:39:15.501]  Let me get your comments on the Black Lives Matter issue, because you mentioned this here.
[00:39:15.721 --> 00:39:17.302]  Hillary Clinton says Black Lives Matter.
[00:39:17.322 --> 00:39:19.782]  I think Joel Gilbert said maybe it's just black votes that matter.
[00:39:20.263 --> 00:39:21.843]  Do you think your black life matters to her?
[00:39:22.323 --> 00:39:24.964]  I don't think my black life matters, but I think you're right.
[00:39:24.984 --> 00:39:25.965]  It's just the black votes.
[00:39:27.105 --> 00:39:35.671]  Like I say, they've been hollering Black Lives Matter for the longest, and I've been out two years and a half with the social media and pushing my story.
[00:39:36.191 --> 00:39:40.374]  I feel that if black lives truly matter, why not my little black life?
[00:39:41.875 --> 00:39:47.059]  The other thing too, and I asked you this during the press conference to comment, I'd like to get it on this interview here.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:56.085]  I'd ask you to comment about the fact that Bill Clinton, at the time that this was heating up in 1998-1999, did a deadbeat father's bill.
[00:39:56.266 --> 00:39:56.626]  Correct.
[00:39:56.866 --> 00:39:59.928]  Unbelievable, the fact that he turned it from a misdemeanor into a felony.
[00:39:59.948 --> 00:40:04.411]  He talked about how for the education, the health of our children, we need to have fathers step forward.
[00:40:04.711 --> 00:40:09.034]  We're bankrupting the welfare system because dads are not taking their responsibility.
[00:40:09.335 --> 00:40:12.377]  And he said it's for the future of the nation, and yet he would not even respond to you.
[00:40:12.837 --> 00:40:13.477]  Right, correct.
[00:40:13.557 --> 00:40:15.719]  I mean, I feel he's the deadbeat dad.
[00:40:17.196 --> 00:40:21.117]  Personally, myself, I started raising my first child in 2003.
[00:40:21.357 --> 00:40:23.258]  I've been there since day one.
[00:40:23.958 --> 00:40:29.380]  I've been there through her hurt, through her hungry, through her dirty diapers, everything.
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:33.501]  And it just hurt me to never experience that with my own father.
[00:40:35.281 --> 00:40:38.982]  And I promise my kids every day, I'm going to try my best.
[00:40:39.002 --> 00:40:44.024]  I'm going to keep pushing until I'm able to get you guys to meet your grandfather one day.
[00:40:44.747 --> 00:40:49.710]  Well let me say, Danny, when you talk about that, you know, nobody has a perfect dad.
[00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:58.555]  And I gotta say that what you have done in stepping up and reestablishing the role of a father, even when you didn't have a father, I really admire that.
[00:40:58.575 --> 00:40:59.215]  I honestly do.
[00:41:00.176 --> 00:41:06.259]  And that's the thing, you have done, and you understand, being there for your children, you know, that has its own reward.
[00:41:06.679 --> 00:41:11.222]  And so Bill Clinton has lost out on knowing a really fine man, Danny Williams.
[00:41:11.942 --> 00:41:12.262]  Thank you.
[00:41:15.319 --> 00:41:16.340]  I'm just going to do my best.
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:19.142]  I'm going to keep pushing it until he steps up.
[00:41:19.782 --> 00:41:21.083]  And I'm going to keep raising my kids.
[00:41:21.443 --> 00:41:22.104]  So, thank you.
[00:41:22.404 --> 00:41:23.705]  Thank you so much, Danny.
[00:41:23.785 --> 00:41:24.265]  Good luck to you.
[00:41:24.285 --> 00:41:25.306]  I hope you get closure on this.
[00:41:25.346 --> 00:41:25.706]  Thank you.
[00:41:25.726 --> 00:41:26.607]  Tell Alex I said hey.
[00:41:26.907 --> 00:41:27.828]  Will do.
[00:41:28.308 --> 00:41:28.548]  Thank you.
[00:41:28.588 --> 00:41:29.949]  David Knight for InfoWars.com.
[00:41:44.738 --> 00:41:49.559]  Danny Williams, you know, very nervous two years ago contacting us and Joe Biggs on Facebook.
[00:41:49.579 --> 00:41:52.039]  And I'm like, yeah, okay, I'm gonna intervene in his hand.
[00:41:52.119 --> 00:41:53.960]  Yeah, it looks like Bill Clinton probably is.
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:55.320]  I mean, sure.
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:59.961]  But then, you know, he talked to Danny, he's working, taking care of his kids, five kids.
[00:42:00.021 --> 00:42:09.683]  You know, it was, he wasn't, we were trying to get him on, but now that the campaign's big, he's now been able to speak out, because this is the season to expose it.
[00:42:10.939 --> 00:42:13.480]  And he was nervous when he was in the studio with us, but he did a great job.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:26.363]  Seeing him with the National Press Club, like a hundred people in the room, and dozens of cameras, or more than that, CNN, Fox, you know, Russian TV, Japanese TV, I'm told.
[00:42:26.943 --> 00:42:27.803]  He did a great job.
[00:42:28.683 --> 00:42:29.943]  And he really let it all out.
[00:42:30.023 --> 00:42:33.844]  And I was just watching him during a break, because we, you know, we obviously were cutting in during a break.
[00:42:33.944 --> 00:42:36.025]  Just his mannerisms, just looks like Bill Clinton.
[00:42:36.977 --> 00:42:38.278]  And they never did a maternity test.
[00:42:38.298 --> 00:42:39.038]  They did a fake test.
[00:42:39.058 --> 00:42:39.758]  That's all come out.
[00:42:39.858 --> 00:42:41.119]  Why don't they just repudiate it?
[00:42:41.699 --> 00:42:47.641]  It's exciting to see this going so viral because it just adds into how fake these people are and how rigged it is.
[00:42:47.661 --> 00:42:49.482]  So, Danny Williams, I won't keep you long.
[00:42:49.522 --> 00:42:50.183]  I know you're busy.
[00:42:50.223 --> 00:42:53.004]  Thanks for this exclusive interview after the press conference.
[00:42:53.064 --> 00:42:54.024]  And thanks for Joel Gilbert.
[00:42:54.704 --> 00:42:57.526]  I remember saying weeks ago, hey, you ought to have a National Press Club conference.
[00:42:57.546 --> 00:42:59.046]  I didn't know that got picked up on.
[00:42:59.066 --> 00:43:00.147]  Or maybe somebody else thought of it too.
[00:43:01.047 --> 00:43:01.187]  Right.
[00:43:01.207 --> 00:43:02.788]  Me and my friends, we got together and we had to set up a
[00:43:19.202 --> 00:43:20.242]  Another press conference.
[00:43:20.342 --> 00:43:25.284]  Actually, it came to be about, uh, for us, the YouTube, my YouTube channel being kicked out.
[00:43:25.384 --> 00:43:36.868]  But, and we wanted to get the message out to Monica Lewinsky for us, uh, trying to get her a blue dress for the DNA sample of my father's, uh,
[00:43:40.954 --> 00:43:42.396]  But it also went great.
[00:43:42.416 --> 00:43:43.657]  It went excellent.
[00:43:43.938 --> 00:43:44.338]  Excellent.
[00:44:02.438 --> 00:44:02.618]  Yes sir.
[00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:25.450]  Right.
[00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:28.471]  I want to thank Fox News and CBS for coming out.
[00:44:28.551 --> 00:44:34.292]  They came out today to hold their position as showing support.
[00:44:34.852 --> 00:44:37.872]  But also, you know, I want to get this out.
[00:44:38.272 --> 00:44:42.493]  Hillary has the power to get Bill to submit to a DNA test.
[00:44:42.513 --> 00:44:48.234]  So I just want to ask her, please, to have your husband step up and submit to a DNA sample.
[00:44:50.614 --> 00:44:51.254]  Absolutely.
[00:44:51.515 --> 00:44:54.035]  When was the first time you were told that Bill Clinton was your father?
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:45:04.062]  Well, I've been told all my life, but the age of eight or nine was when I really realized what was really going on and who was my father.
[00:45:04.582 --> 00:45:16.685]  So, like I said, I've been knowing all my life, since a kid they've been pointing, you know, and when I was three, four years old, my uncle and them used to stick their hands through my hair and say, look at little Bill Clinton son with this curly hair, you know, and all this.
[00:45:17.485 --> 00:45:25.067]  So I've actually been told that all my life, but to really be understanding and know for myself, I was like eight or nine years old.
[00:45:25.871 --> 00:45:28.592]  Well, the media keeps trying to act like you just came up with this.
[00:45:28.632 --> 00:45:30.953]  This has been in the newspapers for 20-something years.
[00:45:31.633 --> 00:45:32.794]  You've always said this.
[00:45:33.654 --> 00:45:34.874]  The Clintons always dodge it.
[00:45:34.914 --> 00:45:37.915]  They act like we're doing this now because of the campaign season.
[00:45:37.935 --> 00:45:39.496]  Well, obviously, these people are liars.
[00:45:40.016 --> 00:45:43.137]  We're trying to force it now because now we can get attention on something.
[00:45:44.078 --> 00:45:44.358]  Right.
[00:45:45.438 --> 00:45:45.958]  Correct.
[00:45:46.098 --> 00:45:49.640]  And it's not that I've been just now doing it.
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:50.360]  I've been doing this
[00:45:51.138 --> 00:46:00.840]  I've been coming out on the media and social media for two and a half years and, you know, it's actually why now the media is giving me the attention.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:12.223]  It's because, you know, she's running again and it's just also giving me another chance to show the world and let them know that, you know, Bill Clinton is my father and I'm trying to prove it.
[00:46:13.649 --> 00:46:16.370]  Well, as you pointed out over and over again, you're not attacking him, any of it.
[00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:22.673]  You just want to meet your father, or you just want to have the paternity test, and he can do that right now.
[00:46:22.693 --> 00:46:26.495]  Now, I wonder if Monica Lewinsky is going to respond.
[00:46:26.515 --> 00:46:29.116]  Right, I hope she does.
[00:46:30.217 --> 00:46:33.678]  I just want to be accepted by my father and my stepmother.
[00:46:34.979 --> 00:46:41.922]  And, you know, I hope and pray that Monica Lewinsky will step up and
[00:46:43.684 --> 00:46:51.223]  Or, you know, just at least coming back on in and let us know, you know, is she willing to do it or if not, you know.

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.244 --> 00:48:52.724]  I don't know.
[00:49:06.752 --> 00:49:22.587]  Welcome back to the Info Wars Nightly News, Owen Troyer with you, and we've got more exit polls, more man on the streets coming out for you, and this recent one is the last one that I did, and what we'll see here is something very interesting.
[00:49:23.433 --> 00:49:28.418]  Now, I'd never had an election official actually come out and talk to me like this one did.
[00:49:28.478 --> 00:49:29.539]  I had no problem with that.
[00:49:29.599 --> 00:49:31.381]  He was making sure that we were abiding by the law.
[00:49:31.761 --> 00:49:32.622]  Perfectly fine.
[00:49:33.002 --> 00:49:44.093]  He came out again, though, and essentially was trying to intimidate us, and without saying it, I think that he kind of outed himself as a Democrat and a Hillary Clinton supporter, but that's just my assumption.
[00:49:44.433 --> 00:49:46.074]  But the one thing that was interesting to me
[00:49:47.015 --> 00:49:50.977]  Is when he says, well, you're asking people about rigged elections.
[00:49:51.017 --> 00:49:53.518]  There's only one candidate saying stuff about that.
[00:49:54.398 --> 00:49:56.439]  No, actually, both candidates are.
[00:49:56.699 --> 00:49:58.560]  So this is, again, nonpartisan.
[00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:05.463]  Donald Trump is saying that the elections might be rigged, citing the machines and what the Democrats have been caught doing.
[00:50:05.783 --> 00:50:09.985]  And then Hillary Clinton is saying they might be rigged, citing the Russians are meddling.
[00:50:10.265 --> 00:50:16.628]  So I'm not sure which candidate he was talking about, but based on the people I've talked to, I think we can take a guess.
[00:50:16.708 --> 00:50:20.810]  It's Hillary Clinton, because nobody seems to know about Hillary Clinton blaming the Russians.
[00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:22.311]  Here's the report from yesterday.
[00:50:23.626 --> 00:50:25.826]  Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[00:50:25.906 --> 00:50:28.687]  I am standing outside of an early voting place.
[00:50:28.727 --> 00:50:31.787]  This is actually considered the mega early voting place.
[00:50:31.807 --> 00:50:34.888]  They've got extra machines in there so you don't have to wait in line.
[00:50:35.288 --> 00:50:42.389]  And actually this is the fourth early voting place I've been to and this is the least amount of people that I've actually seen.
[00:50:42.789 --> 00:50:46.970]  So I'm not sure if that's because early voting's been going on so long that everybody's already done it.
[00:50:47.290 --> 00:50:51.151]  Maybe it's Halloween, people are staying in, or perhaps it's just a dead location.
[00:50:51.191 --> 00:50:52.971]  But this is supposed to be the biggest one.
[00:50:53.211 --> 00:51:19.888]  What we're going to do is we're going to do a little exit polling, but mainly what we're going to try to figure out is if people are worried about election fraud or voter fraud, if they're worried about the integrity of this election, we have massive amounts, copious amounts of evidence that can prove election fraud and voter fraud goes on, and the most recent evidence is the Bev Harris fractional magic report that we've covered that came out today
[00:51:20.268 --> 00:51:26.513]  That is really groundbreaking and shows in real time how the election results can be manipulated.
[00:51:26.733 --> 00:51:34.798]  So with all this proof, with all this evidence, let's go find out, do the American people worry about the integrity of the upcoming election?
[00:51:34.899 --> 00:51:37.280]  You just finished up your early voting in Austin, Texas.
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:38.261]  Who'd you vote for today, sir?
[00:51:38.281 --> 00:51:40.823]  I'm a Democrat.
[00:51:41.763 --> 00:51:42.624]  Straight Democrat ticket?
[00:51:43.365 --> 00:51:43.945]  So Hillary Clinton?
[00:51:44.165 --> 00:51:44.405]  Yes, sir.
[00:51:44.966 --> 00:51:45.806]  Let me ask you a question, sir.
[00:51:45.826 --> 00:51:47.828]  Do you trust the electronic voting machines?
[00:51:49.128 --> 00:51:51.849]  Uh, well, I have no other.
[00:51:52.149 --> 00:51:53.489]  What other alternative do we have?
[00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:57.630]  To accept that they're probably rigged like everything else in this country?
[00:51:57.650 --> 00:52:03.771]  Uh, you could have a point there, I mean... Do you trust the integrity of these elections?
[00:52:04.791 --> 00:52:05.311]  We have to.
[00:52:06.031 --> 00:52:08.052]  If not, then there's no reason for us to be here.
[00:52:08.632 --> 00:52:10.912]  Are you worried, though, that people might be trying to meddle with them?
[00:52:11.733 --> 00:52:18.654]  Possibly, but I feel like there's enough checks and balances that the right thing, the right outcome will happen.
[00:52:19.286 --> 00:52:23.288]  Independently owned, so that they're not biased by the government.
[00:52:23.849 --> 00:52:34.274]  But we need to look into who it's owned by, and if that independent, is there bias within that independent organization.
[00:52:34.475 --> 00:52:45.261]  So what if you saw programs who go and they run the same process that the electronic voting machines do, and then they show how the results can be switched or fixed using decimals and fractions?
[00:52:45.301 --> 00:52:46.421]  Would you maybe lose trust then?
[00:52:46.701 --> 00:52:47.462]  Yeah, for sure.
[00:52:47.884 --> 00:52:49.164]  So that's what we've just discovered.
[00:52:49.265 --> 00:52:49.465]  Yeah.
[00:52:49.705 --> 00:52:51.465]  That seems like it's a thing that's happening right now.
[00:52:51.725 --> 00:52:57.828]  So don't you think it's important, no matter what side you're on, whether you like Hillary or Donald, that we should all be looking at the electronic voting machines?
[00:52:58.068 --> 00:53:01.489]  And if we have doubts in the integrity, perhaps maybe going back to paper ballots?
[00:53:01.789 --> 00:53:02.269]  Absolutely.
[00:53:02.289 --> 00:53:03.490]  I mean, I wouldn't mind taking the time.
[00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:07.491]  If that's what we have to do to get our results correct, it's probably worth it, don't you think?
[00:53:07.511 --> 00:53:07.911]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:53:07.931 --> 00:53:10.192]  And I think it should be fair for everybody, no matter who you're voting for.
[00:53:11.391 --> 00:53:15.436]  I'm the election deputy in here.
[00:53:16.036 --> 00:53:21.903]  You're probably okay as long as you don't discuss candidates, and particularly by name, which that lady did.
[00:53:21.923 --> 00:53:24.746]  It's considered electioneering as long as you're out and away.
[00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:29.071]  So they can't say the name either?
[00:53:29.091 --> 00:53:32.754]  They're really not supposed to because somebody standing here could think they were electioneering.
[00:53:32.834 --> 00:53:40.842]  If I'm saying, if we didn't even bring up any of the candidates and we were just asking... Yeah, no names and we just said, do you trust the electric voting machines and that was it?
[00:53:41.162 --> 00:53:42.484]  I think that that would be okay though?
[00:53:44.523 --> 00:53:46.625]  Why would you think they didn't trust the machines?
[00:53:47.025 --> 00:53:47.845]  Well, there's a lot of people.
[00:53:47.865 --> 00:53:48.706]  Well, that's why we're out here.
[00:53:48.726 --> 00:53:50.327]  Yeah, there's all the reports going on.
[00:53:50.367 --> 00:53:51.388]  They just ran tests on the machines.
[00:53:51.408 --> 00:53:54.670]  So you're interested in all kinds of rumors and stuff.
[00:53:54.970 --> 00:53:59.593]  Why don't y'all call out to the election office and get permission and then come here if you want.
[00:54:03.696 --> 00:54:04.296]  Hi, Mr. Eber?
[00:54:04.336 --> 00:54:09.139]  Yeah.
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:10.060]  Okay.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:11.221]  You want to talk to us?
[00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:13.450]  Really?
[00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:14.531]  You don't want to talk to us at all?
[00:54:14.871 --> 00:54:16.491]  People are concerned the election's going to be rigged.
[00:54:16.531 --> 00:54:19.031]  I guess they're really going to be concerned when they see you turn your back on us.
[00:54:21.332 --> 00:54:21.512]  Yeah.
[00:54:21.792 --> 00:54:22.752]  Well, can I talk to him?
[00:54:23.032 --> 00:54:24.193]  Will anybody here talk to us?
[00:54:25.053 --> 00:54:25.933]  Or do you want to rig this?
[00:54:27.113 --> 00:54:29.594]  Why are you cutting off all these audit trails?
[00:54:29.614 --> 00:54:32.394]  Why are you cutting down the paper audit trails?
[00:54:35.195 --> 00:54:35.755]  Well, there you go.
[00:54:36.618 --> 00:54:37.559]  That should tell you something.
[00:54:37.579 --> 00:54:39.580]  People are concerned about elections being rigged.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.942]  You've got the Director of Elections here at the Secretary of State Office that won't talk to us.
[00:54:44.463 --> 00:54:46.504]  Takes one look at the press and turns around and walks off.
[00:54:46.824 --> 00:54:49.025]  We would really prefer you not run down our system.
[00:54:49.086 --> 00:54:51.387]  People don't really trust anything anymore.
[00:54:51.747 --> 00:54:52.808]  I'm just asking a question.
[00:54:52.848 --> 00:54:53.688]  It's not my report.
[00:54:54.129 --> 00:54:58.791]  I know, but when you ask it in a certain way, you actually influence the person.
[00:54:59.212 --> 00:55:01.113]  Well, I hope I would influence them to do some research.
[00:55:02.125 --> 00:55:02.647]  They won't.
[00:55:02.948 --> 00:55:10.006]  Well, you do realize that one of the candidates is the one who's calling into question whether these things work or not, which makes it a political statement.
[00:55:10.846 --> 00:55:11.647]  No, no, no.
[00:55:11.687 --> 00:55:12.247]  That's not true.
[00:55:12.287 --> 00:55:14.188]  Have you talked with the people who made these things?
[00:55:14.228 --> 00:55:16.409]  Have you talked with the people out there who programmed them?
[00:55:16.829 --> 00:55:18.830]  I was on ballot control one time.
[00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:23.752]  They call us out there and they make sure that those machines are 100% accurate.
[00:55:23.812 --> 00:55:26.233]  We worked... Well, would you want to do an interview with us?
[00:55:26.333 --> 00:55:26.553]  No.
[00:55:26.653 --> 00:55:27.714]  For HART or what company?
[00:55:27.734 --> 00:55:29.735]  I prefer... Diebold or Smartmatic?
[00:55:29.795 --> 00:55:30.035]  HART.
[00:55:30.335 --> 00:55:31.956]  HART's the one that does these.
[00:55:32.636 --> 00:55:33.937]  Their name used to be something different.
[00:55:34.777 --> 00:55:36.197]  But it's hard now, hard graphics.
[00:55:37.037 --> 00:55:41.738]  And it's the one used in Dallas and Houston and El Paso, I think it is.
[00:55:42.439 --> 00:55:46.899]  I'm just saying, it's such a complicated thing to talk about it being fixed is ridiculous.
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:48.520]  I'd have to disagree though.
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:49.240]  Keep playing around.
[00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:50.700]  Yeah, you disagree?
[00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:52.681]  But I'm not doing anything illegal.
[00:55:52.701 --> 00:55:53.701]  We're not trying to play around.
[00:55:53.741 --> 00:55:55.481]  We went to the Capitol office.
[00:55:55.901 --> 00:55:57.681]  I've worked on it for 20 years, okay?
[00:55:58.062 --> 00:56:00.022]  But to sit here and say it's absurd, I mean, that's absurd.
[00:56:01.817 --> 00:56:03.938]  You've got dead people voting and illegal people voting.
[00:56:03.958 --> 00:56:05.700]  Move beyond my marker.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:06.800]  I'll call a constable.
[00:56:07.081 --> 00:56:08.642]  Okay, we're not breaking any laws.
[00:56:09.282 --> 00:56:14.126]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, so we just did some exit polling here and we had to deal with an election official.
[00:56:14.246 --> 00:56:15.667]  Actually we had to deal with him twice.
[00:56:16.108 --> 00:56:17.549]  The first time he asked us to move.
[00:56:18.329 --> 00:56:20.730]  Even though we weren't breaking the law originally, he still had us move.
[00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:21.510]  We obliged.
[00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:23.110]  We wanted to continue doing our interviews.
[00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:30.892]  Then he came and harassed us again, said we weren't outside of the 100 feet, even though it was his marker that we were obeying.
[00:56:30.972 --> 00:56:32.432]  He said we had to go even further.
[00:56:33.032 --> 00:56:36.073]  And then when we tried to talk to him, he didn't seem to like us very much.
[00:56:36.113 --> 00:56:39.293]  He said we were non-existent, InfoWars doesn't exist because he's never heard of it.
[00:56:39.713 --> 00:56:43.354]  And apparently, election rigging doesn't exist either because he's never heard of it.
[00:56:43.814 --> 00:56:47.575]  He says that it's absurd for me to suggest that election rigging is going on
[00:56:48.416 --> 00:56:52.684]  I mean, what's absurd is to sit here and deny that it's even possible.
[00:56:52.724 --> 00:56:54.688]  We've got registered dead voters.
[00:56:55.089 --> 00:56:59.818]  We know that they're pushing amnesty unconstitutionally to get people to vote.
[00:57:00.615 --> 00:57:10.765]  We know that there are hundreds of thousands of people that are registered to vote in multiple states, and now most recently we have reports about how they actually rig the voting machines!
[00:57:11.225 --> 00:57:12.066]  We've got them, folks!
[00:57:12.366 --> 00:57:12.967]  We've caught them!
[00:57:13.427 --> 00:57:15.209]  I'm just out here asking people what they think!
[00:57:15.449 --> 00:57:17.531]  I'm seeing if anybody's engaged, if anybody's awake!
[00:57:17.811 --> 00:57:18.452]  And what do we get?
[00:57:18.752 --> 00:57:23.016]  We get election officials that come out here and try to intimidate us from asking these questions.
[00:57:23.257 --> 00:57:23.617]  And you know what?
[00:57:23.637 --> 00:57:24.538]  Here's the thing about this guy.
[00:57:24.778 --> 00:57:26.821]  Honestly, I'm making this assumption.
[00:57:26.881 --> 00:57:32.788]  My guess is by the way he was talking to us and trying to bash Donald Trump, he probably likes Hillary Clinton.
[00:57:33.809 --> 00:57:34.470]  But either way...
[00:57:35.416 --> 00:57:41.939]  What this guy's deal is, and you heard it, oh, I've been an election official for 20 years, I've been doing this for decades, I know what I'm doing.
[00:57:42.579 --> 00:57:43.180]  So what?
[00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:44.360]  So what?
[00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:45.921]  It doesn't matter how long you've been doing it.
[00:57:46.581 --> 00:57:49.502]  For whatever reason, you've been doing this for so long and you've ignored this evidence.
[00:57:49.983 --> 00:57:50.263]  Okay?
[00:57:50.563 --> 00:57:51.543]  We have it all now.
[00:57:51.843 --> 00:57:58.927]  So it doesn't matter how long you've been an election official, we have the evidence, we don't trust the results, and we're going to keep a close eye on this.
[00:57:59.187 --> 00:58:00.287]  And it's not absurd at all.
[00:58:00.707 --> 00:58:03.549]  But he has threatened to call the authorities, call the constable,
[00:58:04.349 --> 00:58:07.050]  Says we're breaking the law, even though we've done nothing of the sort, folks.
[00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:09.190]  I've done no electioneering here at all.
[00:58:09.610 --> 00:58:10.930]  But he threatened to call the authorities.
[00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:11.871]  He's been bothering us.
[00:58:11.971 --> 00:58:13.271]  So, I'm not surprised.
[00:58:13.291 --> 00:58:17.672]  These are the kind of electioneers that, uh, election officials that we deal with in Texas.
[00:58:17.732 --> 00:58:18.512]  It's really sad.
[00:58:18.872 --> 00:58:27.794]  We're just trying to maintain the integrity of the election, and election officials want to demonize us and get us booted from outside early voting stations.
[00:58:28.911 --> 00:58:30.333]  So there you have it, folks.
[00:58:30.774 --> 00:58:35.541]  Election officials wanting us to stop talking to people and get off the ground.
[00:58:35.641 --> 00:58:37.864]  Thanks so much for everybody for tuning in to the Nightly News.
