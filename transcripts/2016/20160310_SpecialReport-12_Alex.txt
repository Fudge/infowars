[00:00:04.926 --> 00:00:10.390]  The Titanic, we all know, is the global economy, appears to be moving along at full speed.
[00:00:10.751 --> 00:00:13.313]  But signs of sea ice are dead ahead.
[00:00:13.593 --> 00:00:21.179]  The first alarm bells have been sounded from several economists that know to look for the most subtle signs of danger of a global economic collapse.
[00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.217]  We have a bubble around the world in demographic spending, which keeps declining in more countries.
[00:00:27.297 --> 00:00:29.359]  And we can predict this by country.
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.383]  Japan was the first to peak, and then the U.S.
[00:00:32.463 --> 00:00:33.184]  and now Europe.
[00:00:33.524 --> 00:00:40.673]  But we also have the greatest debt bubble in modern history, two to four times what we've seen back in the Roaring Twenties.
[00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:42.253]  Last time we had a debt bubble.
[00:00:42.513 --> 00:00:55.756]  And all we need, like in 2008 with the subprime crisis, is a trigger to cause this debt bubble to reset and deleverage, or what I call a financial detox.
[00:00:56.076 --> 00:01:06.718]  And when you go south of the border, even below Mexico Way, it's currency crisis after currency crisis, commodity crash after commodity crash.
[00:01:07.098 --> 00:01:08.999]  Current events form future trends.
[00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:12.023]  What happened yesterday over in Brazil?
[00:01:12.343 --> 00:01:13.465]  Well, they had a wonderful time.
[00:01:13.485 --> 00:01:17.291]  About a half a million people turned out to protest against the government.
[00:01:17.632 --> 00:01:18.153]  How come?
[00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:19.615]  Well, they're in a recession.
[00:01:20.196 --> 00:01:23.601]  Inflation is skyrocketing and the currency is plummeting.
[00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.431]  Is the economy moving?
[00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:28.194]  The Baltic Dry Index has hit a new low.
[00:01:28.474 --> 00:01:39.464]  The Baltic Dry Index is the assessment of the price of moving all of the globe's major raw materials by sea, including commodities like coal, grain, and iron ore.
[00:01:39.804 --> 00:01:48.646]  Tyler Durden of Zero Hedge reports, Last week I received news from a contact who is friends with one of the biggest billionaire shipping families in the world.
[00:01:48.846 --> 00:01:54.587]  He told me they had no ships at sea right now because operating them meant running at a loss.
[00:01:54.927 --> 00:02:02.428]  Commerce between Europe and North America has literally come to a halt for the first time in known history.
[00:02:02.748 --> 00:02:08.289]  Not one cargo ship is in transit in the North Atlantic between Europe and North America.
[00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.090]  All of them, hundreds, are either anchored offshore or in port.
[00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.751]  Nothing is moving.
[00:02:15.131 --> 00:02:19.992]  It is a horrific economic sign, proof that commerce has literally stopped.
[00:02:20.272 --> 00:02:27.334]  The very Chinese shipyards supplying the needed vessels to transport the world's raw materials are going bankrupt.
[00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:28.194]  We're good to go.
[00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:48.865]  In the UK you have the ability to sell the same bond
[00:03:15.993 --> 00:03:17.333]  An infinite number of times.
[00:03:18.354 --> 00:03:19.894]  In the United States, you're limited.
[00:03:19.954 --> 00:03:23.535]  You can't sell the same bond an infinite number of times.
[00:03:23.575 --> 00:03:27.776]  You can sell it a few times and claim that it has a collateral value.
[00:03:28.237 --> 00:03:37.079]  But in the UK, and this is why all of the major banks and all the major countries, treasuries, outsource their fraud to the UK.
[00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:39.980]  This is why the UK is responsible for the Lehman collapse.
[00:03:40.635 --> 00:03:44.539]  The Dow Jones has lost 1500 points in 10 days and still has a lot further to fall.
[00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:46.020]  The fragility of the markets are worse than pre-2008.
[00:04:03.797 --> 00:04:07.461]  Anyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction.
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.322]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, you can get six months free at PrisonPlanet.TV, but only for one more week.
[00:04:37.503 --> 00:04:40.784]  Next Monday, the special that only comes around once a year ends.
[00:04:40.844 --> 00:04:51.828]  In fact, we've never offered six months free before, but I really want to get more people to join and to be able to watch the nightly news, to see the live reports we do, the special reports, all my films, e-books, and so much more.

[00:05:24.773 --> 00:05:40.442]  Paying it forward and financing and helping so many other people see the truth when we put the videos on Facebook, YouTube, and it's PrisonPlanet.TV that finances so much of the cameras, the equipment, the crew.
[00:05:40.822 --> 00:05:41.522]  The Reporters.

[00:06:10.472 --> 00:06:18.718]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:23.581]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:06:30.526 --> 00:06:37.609]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:44.571]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:06:44.731 --> 00:06:49.093]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
